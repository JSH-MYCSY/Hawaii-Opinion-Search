OPINION OF THE COURT BY POLLACK, J.  
  The right to have all elements of a charged criminal 
offense proven beyond a reasonable doubt is one of the 
fundamental principles of our justice system.  In State v. 
Murray, we held that a trial court must engage a defendant in an 
on-the-record colloquy to ensure that the defendant is 
intelligently, knowingly, and voluntarily relinquish ing this Electronically Filed

 2 fundamental right before  the court may accept the defendant’s 
admission of an element of a crime.  116 Hawai i 3, 12, 169 P.3d 
955, 964 (2007).  We now reiterate our holding in Murray and 
decline to establish an exception to the colloquy requirement  
when a stipulation is  based on  trial strategy or time 
constraints. 
I. BACKGROUND 
  In April 2011, Rachel Viamoana Ui and Jacob Wong, Ui’s 
co-worker, were involved in a traffic collision in Kona on the 
island of Hawaiʻ i.  The two were traveling in Wong’s vehicle, 
which “rolled” after it collided with a concrete construction 
barrier on Kamakaeha Avenue, eventually coming to a stop on its 
roof.  When an  ambulance arrived, the responding emergency 
medical technician found Ui  unconscious a few feet from the 
driver-side door of the vehicle.  Ui was transported to Kona 
Hospital, where an emergency room physician informed the 
responding police officer that he smelled alcohol on her person
.  
Acting pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-21 
(Supp. 2006), the officer requested that the hospital obtain a 
blood sample from Ui in order to determine her blood alcohol 
content (BAC).  Ronald Luga, a medical technician employed by 
the hospital, proceeded to draw two vials of blood from Ui while 
she remained unconscious. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 3 A. District Court Proceedings 
  T he State of Hawai ʻi filed a complaint in the District 
Court of the Third Circuit (district court) charging Ui with 
operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant (OVUII) 
in violation of HRS § 291E-61(a) ( Supp. 2011 )1 and driving 
without a license in violation of HRS § 286- 102(b)2 (2007).3  Ui 
pleaded not guilty to both charges.  
                         
 1 HRS § 291E -61 provides in relevant part as follows:  
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle under the 
influence of an intoxicant if the person operates or assumes 
actual physical control of a vehicle:  
(1) While under the influence of alcohol in an amount 
sufficient to impair the person’s normal mental faculties 
or ability to care for the person and guard against 
casualty; [or]  
. . .  
(4) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per one hundred 
milliliters or cubic centimeters of blood. 
 2 HRS § 286 -102(b) provides in relevant part as follows:  
(b) A person operating the following category or 
combination of categories of motor vehicles shall be 
examined . . . and duly licensed by the examiner of 
drivers: 
. . . 
(3) Passenger cars of any gross vehicle weight 
rating, buses designed to transport fifteen or fewer 
occupants, and trucks and vans having a gross vehicle 
weight rating of fifteen thousand pounds or less . . 
. .

Count 1 (C11009451/KN)  
 
(continued . . .)  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 4   During  the bench trial,4 the parties offered 
conflicting testimony as to whether Ui was driving at the time 
of the accident.  Ui and Wong both acknowledged that they drank 
heavily on the night in question and testified that Wong had 
driven the two to a local store prior to the collision.  Wong 
claimed that Ui insisted upon driving his truck when they left 
the store and was in control of the vehicle when it collided 
with the concrete barrier.  In contrast, Ui asserted that she 
had “passed out” in  Wong’s passenger seat while still at the 
store and was sleeping when the collision occurred.  
                                                                               
(. . . continued) 
 
On or about the 13th day of April, 2011, in Kona, County 
and State of Hawai i, RACHEL UI, did operate or assume 
actual physical control of a vehicle on any public way, 
street, road, or highway, while under the influence of 
alcohol in an amount sufficient to impa ir Defendant’s 
normal mental faculties or ability to care for Defendant’s 
self and guard against casualty; and/or with .08 or more 
grams of alcohol per one hundred milliliters or cubic 
centimeters of blood, thereby committing the offense of 
Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant, 
in violation of Section 291E -61(a), Hawai i Revised 
Statutes, as amended.  
  Count 2 
On or about the 13th day of April, 2011, in Kona, County 
and State of Hawai i, RACHEL UI, did operate a motor vehicle 
of a category listed in Section 286 -102 of the Hawai i 
Revised Statutes, without first being appropriately 
examined and duly licensed as a qualified driver of that 
category of motor vehicles, thereby committing the offense 
of Driving Without a License, in violation of Section 286 -
102(b), Hawai i Revised Statutes, as amended.  
 4 The Honorable Joseph P. Florendo presided.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 5   T he State called  Luga to testify regarding the blood 
draw he performed on Ui.   Before Luga’s testimony could begin, 
Ui’s defense counsel  interrupted:   
I was speaking with Ms. Ui, and we may be willing to 
stipulate to certain things to save time with these  
witnesses.   
 Ms. Ui’s asking me, was asking me if these witnesses 
are necessary, a nd I explained to her not if we’ re willing 
to stipulate to certain things.  And I know that we’ re 
trying to get a lot  done today.   So if I could just briefly 
speak with her, and maybe the prosecution, about what we’d 
be willing to stipulate to, to save . . . the need of these 
witnesses.  
[Tr 4/13/12, 43:67]  The court granted a recess  to allow defense 
counsel to confer with Ui and the prosecuting attorney. 
  Following the  recess, defense counsel orally 
stipulated to the following: (1) Ui’s blood was drawn within 
three hours of the report of the accident; (2) Ui’s blood was 
drawn in accordance with the Hawai i Administrative Rules; and 
(3) the blood samples were properly secured and transported to 
the laboratory.  Additionally, defense counsel stipulated that 
Ui’s blood test results  showed a BAC of 0.156  grams of alcohol 
per one hundred milliliters or cubic centimeters of blood.  
Defense counsel indic ated that he had “reviewed those 
stipulations” with Ui  and “we’re not challenging any of those 
facts.”  
  
The district court did not engage  Ui in a colloquy 
regarding the stipulation to the blood test results, and a 
written copy of the stipulation was not provided to the court.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 6 Neither the court nor counsel acknowledged that the stipulated 
facts constituted proof of one of the two elements of a HRS § 
291E-61(a)(4) offense.  See Hawai i Standard Jury Instructions 
Criminal 16.05 (2004) (providing that the two elements of a 
violation are 1) operating a vehicle and 2) having 0.8 or more 
grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters or cubic centimeters of 
blood). 
  At the conclusion of evidence, the district court 
found Ui guilty of OVUII  and of driving without a license.   The 
court sentenced Ui to pay a $1,000 fine and other monetary fees, 
attend a fourteen- hour driver’s education course, and obtain a 
substance abuse assessment. 
B. Proceedings Before the Intermediate Court of Appeals 
  Approximately twenty- eight months later , Ui, 
represented by new counsel, filed a notice of appeal to the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA).5  Ui argued that the State 
had failed to allege in its initial complaint that she had acted 
with the state of mind required to commit both offenses.   With 
regard to the OVUII conviction, Ui argued it should be vacated 
                         
 5 Shortly after the appeal was filed, Ui filed a statement of 
jurisdiction that argued  the untimeliness of her notice of appeal should be 
excused under State v. Caraballo , 62 Haw. 309, 316, 615 P.2d 91, 96 (1980), 
because Ui’s court- appointed counsel had failed to take the procedural steps 
to effectuate Ui’s expressed desire to appeal.  The State did not contest the 
timeliness of Ui’s appeal to the ICA . ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 7 because the language of the district court’s ruling left it 
unclear whether the conviction was premised on HRS § 291E-
61(a)(1)--which includes a state of mind requirement not alleged 
in the complaint--or HRS § 291E-61(a)(4)--which does not.6   
  In a Summary Disposition Order (SDO), the ICA vacated 
Ui’s conviction for driving without a license in violation of 
HRS § 286-102.7  The ICA reasoned that, because HRS § 286- 102 
does not in itself specify a requisite state of mind with 
respect to the conduct it prohibits, HRS § 702-204 (2014)8 
requires that a defendant must have undertaken each element of 
the offense intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly
 in order to 
be convicted.  The ICA held that, because the State had not  
alleged a mens rea in its complaint, dismissal of the driving 
without a license charge without prejudice was warranted
 under 
this court’s decision in State v. Apollonio , 130 Hawai i 353, 
359, 311 P.3d 676, 682 (2013).  
                         
 6 An OVUII offense may be established either by proving a defendant 
drove while under the influence of an amount of alcohol sufficient to cause 
impairment under HRS § 291E -61(a)(1) or by proving a defendant drove with .08 
or more grams of alcohol per one hundred milliliters or cubic centimeters of 
blood under HRS § 291E -61(a)(4).  State v. Grindles , 70 Haw. 528, 530, 777 
P.2d 1187, 1189 (1989).  The subsections are not separate offenses, but 
rather separate methods of proof for a single offense.  Id. 
 
 7 The ICA’s SDO can be found at State v. Ui , No. CAAP– 15–0000402, 
2016 WL 3018301 (Haw. App. May 25, 2016).   
 8 HRS § 702 -204 provides in relevant part as follows: “When the 
state of mind required to establish  an element of an offense is not specified 
by the law, that element is established if, with respect thereto, a person 
acts intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly.”  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 8   The ICA also determined  that Ui’s OVUII conviction was 
based on violations of both HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) (impairment of 
ability to care for oneself) and HRS § 291E- 61(a)(4)  (BAC over 
.08).  Because HRS § 291E-61(a)(4) is a strict liability method 
of proof that does not require the State 
to allege  a mens rea 
under our precedents, see  State v. Nesmith , 127 Hawaii 48, 58-
61, 276 P.3d 617, 627- 30 (2012), the ICA affirmed Ui’s OV UII 
conviction under HRS § 291E-61(a)(4). 
  Following issuance of the SDO, Ui filed a motion for 
reconsideration.  Ui argued that this court’s then -recent 
decision in State v. Won , 137 Hawai i 330, 372 P.3d 1065 (2015), 
in which we held that the State may not use the threat of 
criminal sanctions to coerce a driver into consenting to a 
breath or blood test,  rendered her blood test results 
inadmissible.9  The ICA should therefore vacate her HRS § 291E-
61(a)(4) conviction,  Ui contended,  and remand the case to permit 
her to move to suppress the blood test results.  The ICA denied 
the motion, determining that Ui had waived the issue of 
admissibility by failing to move for suppression of the test 
results prior to trial. 
                         
 9 Ui initially raised Won’s applicability to her case in a motion 
for leave to file supple mental briefing prior to the ICA’s SDO.  The ICA 
denied Ui’s motion. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 9 II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW  
  Both the reasonableness of a search and the validity 
of a defendant’s waiver of his or her constitutional rights  are 
questions of constitutional law.   See State v. Quiday , 141 
Hawaii 116, 121, 405 P.3d 552, 557 (2017) ; State v. Friedman , 93 
Hawaiʻi 63, 67, 996 P.2d 268, 272 (2000 ).  “We answer questions 
of constitutional law by exercising our own independent 
constitutional judgment based on the facts of the case.  Thus, 
we review questions of constitutional law under the right/wrong 
standard.”  Friedman , 93 Hawa iʻi at 67, 996 P.2d at 272  (quoting 
State v. Hanapi, 89 Hawai i 177, 182, 970 P.2d 485, 490 (1998)).  
III.  DISCUSSION  
  In her application for a writ of certiorari , Ui 
contends that the ICA erred in failing to apply State v. Won , 
137 Hawai i 330, 372 P.3d 1065 (2015) , to vacate her HRS § 291E -
61(a)(4) conviction.   The State responds that the ICA correctly 
held that Ui is not similarly situated to the defendant in Won.10 
                         
 10 The State also argues for the first time in response to Ui’s 
certiorari application that the ICA lacked jurisdiction because Ui’s appeal 
was untimely.  Ui expressed her intention to appeal during sentencing , and 
Ui’s appointed trial counsel was aware of that intention, as evidenced by 
counsel’s filing of an ex parte motion to extend the time to file a notice of 
appeal.  The record does not indicate that Ui’s trial counsel filed a motio n 
to withdraw.  Due process dictates that a defendant may not be deprived of an 
appeal because appointed counsel failed to comply with procedural rules.  
State v. Knight, 80 Hawai i 318, 323- 24, 909 P.2d 1133, 1138 -39 (1996); see 
also Maddox v. State , 141 Hawai i 196, 204-0 5, 407 P.3d 152, 160-6 1 (2017) 
(holding that trial counsel is constitutionally ineffective when counsel is 
 
(continued . . .)  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 10   Additionally, this court directed the parties t o 
submit supplemental briefing on the following questions: (1) 
whether the district court erred by failing to engage Ui in a 
colloquy regarding the blood test stipulation as required by 
State v. Murray, 116 Hawai i 3, 12, 169 P.3d 955, 964 (2007) , and 
(2) whether, if the district court erred by not engaging Ui in a 
colloquy, this court should recognize plain error and vacate 
Ui’s conviction. 
A. State v. Won  Is Inapplicable T o Ui’s Blood Draw.  
  In Won, we held that  law enforcement’s  use of a n 
“implied consent for m” that threaten ed criminal penalties for 
refusing a BAC test was inherently coercive and rendered a 
driver’s ensuing consent  invalid under article I, section 7 of 
the Hawaiʻ i Constitution .  137 Hawai ʻi at 347-48, 372 P.3d at 
1082-83.  When Ui’s blood was drawn at Kona Community Hospital 
after the accident, no request was made that she consent to 
testing, nor was an implied consent form advising of possible 
criminal penalties involved .  Because Ui’s blood draw wa s not 
predicated on her consent, Won does not provide authority  to 
challenge Ui’s HRS § 291E-61(a)(4) conviction  on this basis .  
                                                                               
(. . . continued) 
 
aware of a defendant’s desire to appeal and fails to take the procedural 
steps to effectuate or protect the defendant’s right to appeal).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 11 See id. at 344 n.26 , 372 P.3d at 1079 n.26  (citing State v.  
Entrekin, 98 Hawai i 221, 232, 47 P.3d 336, 347 (2002) ) (setting 
forth constitutional requirements for a nonconsensual, 
warrantless blood extraction  pursuant to HRS § 291E -21).11 
B. State v. Murray  Required An On-the-Record Colloquy . 
1.  A Colloquy is Required Prior to Any Stipulation to an 
Element of an Offense  
  It is well settled in Hawai i law that a defendant 
relinquishes fundamental right s only when a waiver is undertaken 
intelligently, knowing ly, and voluntar ily.  Murray, 116 Hawai ʻi 
at 10-11, 169 P.3d at 962 -63 (citing State v. Ibuos , 75 Haw. 
118, 121, 857 P.2d 576, 578 (1993) ; Tachibana v. State , 79 
Hawaii 226, 235, 900 P.2d 1293, 1302 (1995)).  Reviewing courts  
will not presume a defendant’s acquiescence in the loss of 
fundamental rights  on the basis of  a silent record.  Wong v. 
Among, 52 Haw. 420, 424, 477 P.2d 630, 63 3-34 (1970) .  Rather, 
an affirmative, on -the-record waiver must come directly  from the 
defendant, and counsel  may not waive  fundamental  rights on a 
client’s behalf.  Murray, 116 Hawai i at 10, 169 P.3d at 962.  
                         
 11 We express no opinion as to the applicability of Birchfield v. 
North Dakota  to this case.  136 S. Ct. 2160 (2016).  On retrial, the district 
court may consider whether Ui’s blood draw was performed pursuant to exigent 
circumstances or solely as an incident to her arrest.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 12   To ensure these requirements are met, it is necessary 
for a trial court to engage a defendant in a n on-the-record 
colloquy before accepting a waiver of any of the  rights we have 
held to be fundamental , including the right to counsel, Carvalho  
v. Olim, 55 Haw. 336, 34 2-43, 519 P.2d 892, 897 (1974) , the 
right to trial by jury , Ibuos, 75 Haw. at 121, 857 P.2d at 578 , 
and the right of a defendant to testify on his or her own 
behalf, Tachibana, 79 Hawai ʻi at 236, 900 P.2d at 1303. 
  In Murray, this court considered whether  the on-the-
record colloquy requirement should be applied to a defendant’s 
stipulation to an element of an offense.  116 Hawai ʻi at 9, 169 
P.3d at 961.  Murray was charged with abuse of family or 
household members under HRS § 709-906 (Supp. 200 6) with a 
statutory felony enhancement  based on two previous convictions 
for the same offense within a specified period .12  Id. at 5-6, 
169 P.3d at 957-58 .  Prior to trial , Murray’s  counsel stipulated 
that Murray had been convicted under the statute twice within 
                         
 12 In relevant part, HRS § 709 -906 states  as follows: 
(1) It shall be unlawful for any person, singly or in 
concert, to physically abuse a family or household member 
or to refuse compliance with the lawful order of a police 
officer under subsection (4).  
. . .  
(7) For a third or any subsequent offense that occurs 
within two years of a second or subsequent conviction, the 
offense shall be a class C felony.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 13 the required time frame, thus satisfying an element of the 
offense.  Id. at 5, 169 P.3d at 957.   The trial court did not 
address Murray in a colloquy regarding the constitutional rights 
he was waiving by s tipulating to his prior convictions.  Id. 
  On review, this court held that the right to have all 
elements proven beyond a reasonable doubt is a fundamental right 
guaranteed under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the 
United States Constitution;  article I , section 5 of the Hawai ʻi 
Constitution; and HRS § 701-114 (1993).13  Id. at 10-12, 169 P.3d 
at 962-64.  We determined that “a colloquy between the trial 
court and defendant 
is the best way to ensure that a d efendant’ s 
constitutional right . . . is protected ” because it guarantees  
that a defendant understands the nature of the fundamental 
rights being relinquished, the full consequences of such a 
                         
 13 HRS § 701 -114 states the following : 
(1) Except as otherwise provided in section 701- 115, no 
person may be convicted of an offense unless the following 
are proved beyond a reasonable doubt:  
(a) Each element of the offense;  
(b) The state of mind required to establish each 
element of the offense;  
(c) Facts establishing jurisdiction; 
(d) Facts establishing venue; and  
(e) Facts establishing that the offense was committed 
within the time period specified in section 701 -108. 
(2) In the absence of the proof required by subsection (1), 
the innocence of the defendant is presumed.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 14 waiver, and the defendant’s unrestricted personal discretion as 
to whether to undertake the waiver.14  Id. at 12, 169 P.3d at 
964.  
  Thus , we determined that a colloquy is the most 
reliable procedure to ensure the defendant’s waiver is knowing, 
intelligent, and voluntary.  Id.  We reasoned in Murray that 
“the colloquy approach also best promotes judicial efficiency by 
establishing on the record that the defendant has voluntarily 
waived an element of the offense ,” thus minimizing post -trial 
challenges.  Id.   We therefore held that the trial court must 
conduct a colloquy when a defendant wishes to waive the right to 
have all elements of an offense proven beyond a reasonable 
doubt, which occurs when a defendant stipulates to one or more 
elements.  Id. 
  The requirement that all elements of an offense be 
proven beyond a reasonable doubt arises out of the presumption 
of innocence, one of the fundamental principles that establish 
the foundation of our justice system.  Coffin v. U.S., 156 U.S. 
432, 452-61 (1895); see also State v. Basham , 132 Hawai i 97, 
116, 319 P.3d 1105, 1124 (2014).  No defendant in this State may 
                         
 14 To the extent the State argues Murray established a colloquy 
requirement only for stipulations regarding past convictions, it is mistaken.  
See Murray, 116 Hawai i at 12, 169 P.3d at 964 (“[T]he trial court must 
conduct a colloquy regarding waiver of proof of an element of the offense.”).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 15 be found guilty until the prosecution overcomes the defendant’s 
presumption of innocence as to each  element of the charged 
offense.  State v. Lima , 64 Haw. 470, 474, 643 P.2d 536, 539 
(1982); HRS § 701-114. 
  The waiver of the  constitutional right to have each 
element of an offense proven beyond a reasonable doubt is not a n 
insignificant or routine procedural matter.  By its very nature, 
the right encompasses a number of other constitutional
 rights, 
including the right to confront and cross- examine witnesses  as 
to the stipulated element and the right to adduce contrary 
evidence regarding the stipulated element.  83 C.J.S. 
Stipulations § 5 (2017) (“A stipulation bars a party who enters 
into it from adducing evidence to dispute the stipulated facts 
or the circumstances surrounding them.” ).  The stipulation also 
acts as a waiver of any potential defenses to the element, both 
at trial and on appeal.  Id. § 78 (“ A stipulation as to facts 
also functions as a waiver of legal defenses to the 
establishment of the particular element to which the parties 
have stipulated, and therefo re is not reviewable on appeal.” ).  
In the absence of a colloquy, there is little by which a court 
can gauge whether a defendant understands that stipulating to 
facts comprising an element of an offense amounts to such a 
sweeping concession.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 16   In short, the right to have all elements of an offense 
proven beyond a reasonable doubt is of fundamental importance.  
We accordingly reaffirm that an on-the-record colloquy is 
required to protect against the wrongful denial of this righ
t. 
2. Trial Strategy is not an Exception to  the Mandatory 
Colloquy  Required by State v. Murray  
  The State argues that there were tactical advantages 
to the stipulation and  consequently a  Murray colloquy  was not 
required to be conducted by the trial court .  Our precedents 
place certain tactical decisions within the discretion  of 
defense counsel after consultation with a defendant to the 
extent feasible and appropriate.   See State v. Richie , 88 Hawai i 
19, 39, 960 P.2d 1227, 1247 (1998) (citing American Bar 
Association, Standards for Criminal Justice —Prosecution Function 
and Defense Function, Standard 4 –5.2 (3d ed.  1993)).  Our 
decision in Murray, however,  makes clear that the final decision 
to stipulate to evidence pr oving an element of an offense 
resides solely with the defendant .  116 Hawaiʻi at 12, 169 P.3d 
at 964.  Indeed, the  Murray court held that the ICA had gravely 
erred by concluding  the stipulation was “ a tactical decision 
permissibly made by counsel for the defendant .”  Id. at 7, 13, 
169 P.3d at 959, 965 .  In reviewing applicable precedent, we 
noted expressly that “ a defendant’ s constitutional rights may 
not be waived by counsel  . . . as a tactical matter .”  Id. at ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 17 11, 169 P.3d at 963 (citing Tachibana v. State , 79 Hawai i 226, 
229, 232, 900 P.2d 1293 , 1296, 1299  (1995)). 
  Creating a  trial strategy exception  to the requirement 
that a court engage a defendant in a colloquy prior to accepting 
a stipulation to an  element of an offense would be a sharp 
deviation from the procedure for waiving  other fundamental 
rights.  An attorney may not , for example,  waive a defendant’s 
right to a jury trial when the attorney consider s a bench trial  
strategically advantageous.  State v. Ibuos, 75 Haw. 118,  121, 
857 P.2d 576, 578 (1993); see also State v. Young , 73 Haw. 217, 
221, 830 P.2d 512, 515  (1992) (overruling State v. Olivera , 53 
Haw. 551, 497 P.2d 1360  (1972), which held that counsel may 
waive a jury trial on a client’s behalf).  Nor may defense 
counsel waive a defendant’s right to testify as a matter of 
trial strategy.  Tachibana, 79 Hawai ʻi at 232, 900 P.2d at 1299 
(holding that defense counsel may not waive a defendant’s right 
to testify in his or her own behalf  for tactical reasons ). 
  A trial strategy exception would also ultimately 
swallow the colloquy rule.  Stipulations by definition are 
voluntary agreement s between opposing parties.  Stipulation , 
Black’s Law Dictionary  (10th ed. 2014).  As a voluntary 
agreement, there is little incentive  for counsel to enter into a 
stipulation unless it is viewed as beneficial  in some fashion .  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 18 This is to say that e very decision to stipulate to evidence in a 
case may be considered within the bounds of the trial strategy 
exception argued by the State .  See Gonzalez v. United States , 
553 U.S. 242, 256 (2008) (Scalia, J., concurring  in the 
judgment) (“Depending on the circumstances, waiving any right 
can be a tactical decision.”).    
  Even assuming that stipulations that involve trial 
strategy can be distinguished from those that do not, it is 
unclear what this distinction is and how a court would make the 
determination.  Th e evaluat ion would invariably need to be made 
by the trial court because whether a particular stipulatio n is 
strategic is a fact -laden determination .  In assessing whether a 
colloquy is required, a trial court would need to inquire of 
counsel whether the stipulation was based on strategy or some 
other consideration.  The response by defense counsel  to this 
question in itself poses a risk of invading the attorney -client 
privilege and may also be potentially damaging to the defense.  
The follow- up questions necessary to determine the accuracy of a 
counsel’s assessment would compound and heighten these concerns.  
  The present case amply demonstrates  that reviewing 
courts are not well positioned to ascertain the reasons 
underlying a stipulation  when such a  judicial  inquiry does not 
take place at the trial level .  Ui’s counsel stated the 
stipulation was intended simply to “save time ” because they were ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 19 “trying to get a lot done today. ”  Despite this indication that 
the stipulation was driven by administrative time constraints, 
the State argues that Ui “had clear strategi c and tactical 
reasons for stipulating to the blood alcohol results .”  As would 
likely be true in any appellate case in which judicial inquiry 
was not done at the trial level , an accurate evaluation of the 
issue would require remand for a hearing at which counsel and 
the defendant would have to testify or respond to inquiries  
regarding potentially privileged communications.15  And, as the 
State appears to concede  [SB at 9], remand for an evidentiary 
hearing may be required even when its proposed trial strategy 
exception to the colloquy requirement would apply because the 
strategic advantages of a stipulation are only one aspect to be 
considered in evaluating whether a defendant’s waiver was 
knowing, intelligent, and voluntary under the total ity of the 
circumstances.  Thus,  the cost to judicial resources of 
determining whether a colloquy was excused under a trial 
strategy exception  would negate the efficiency benefits the 
                         
 15 Indeed, our own precedents also evidence the difficulty inherent 
in distinguishing strategic stipulations from those undertaken solely for 
administrative convenience.  See State v. Pratt , 127 Hawai i 206, 225  n.6, 277 
P.3d 300, 319 n.6 (2012) (Acoba, J., dissenting) (disputing the majority’s 
characterization of a stipulation as tactical, stating “it would not appear 
this strategy had an obvious basis for benefitting Petitioner’s case” 
(brackets and quotations omitted)).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 20 colloquy requirement  affords.  See Murray , 116 Hawai i at 12, 169 
P.3d at 964. 
  Further, the stipulation in Murray itself was clearly 
a strategic decision  that would fall squarely within the State’s 
argued exception .  By relinquishing the right to have his prior 
convictions proven beyond a reasonable doubt, Murray avoided 
“the prejudice that would result from relating the details of 
the previous incidents to the jury.”  116 Hawai i at 20, 169 P.3d 
at 972.  Murray’s decision represented a determination that it 
was advantageous for him to concede one element of  the charged 
offense and focus his trial efforts on disproving those elements 
that remained.  Despite the clear strategic  analysis inherent in 
his decision, w e held that the “stipulation [could] be accepted 
only after engaging [Murray] in an on -the-record colloquy 
regarding [his] constitutional rights, and ensuring that [Murray 
made] a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to have the 
prior convictions proven beyond a reasonable doubt and decided 
by a jury.”  Id. at 21, 169 P.3d  at 973.  The State’s arg ued 
trial strategy exception would thus constitute a sub silentio  
reversal of our holding in Murray. 
  In sum, establish ing a trial strategy exception to the 
Murray colloquy requirement would fatally undermine the 
procedural safeguards we have created for defendant s’ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 21 fundamental rights .  It would also introduce  administrative 
difficulties that would undercut the benefits  to judicial 
economy granted by the  colloquy requirement.   See Murray , 116 
Hawaii at 12, 169 P.3d at 964.   And it would represent an 
effective overruling of Murray  and other cases in which we have 
held that a knowing, intelligent, and voluntar y waiver cannot be 
assumed from counsel’s words and actions , regardless of 
strategic reasons for counsel’s statement of waiver.  E.g., 
Tachibana, 79 Hawai i at 232 , 900 P.2d at 1299 ; Young, 73 Haw. at 
221, 830 P.2d at 515 .  We therefore decline to adopt such an 
exception. 
3. The Trial Court Failed to Engage Ui in an On-the-Record 
Colloquy  
  During the State’s case -in-chief, the district  court 
recessed to allow the parties to discuss a possible stipulation .  
Following the recess, counsel proceeded to orally stipulate to 
the evidentiary foundation and results of Ui’s blood test.  The 
court did not address Ui before the stipulation was read to, and 
accepted by, the district court .  The district court did not 
attempt to determine whether Ui understood the natur e of the 
rights she was waiving  and the consequences of that waiver, nor 
did it ascertain whether the waiver was the product of Ui’ s 
unrestrained choice.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 22   As stated,  Murray requires  a trial court to conduct an 
on-the-record colloquy with the defendant before accepting a 
waiver of the fundamental right  to have all elements of a charge 
proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  116 Hawai ʻi at 12, 169 P.3d at 
964.  Only when the court has ensured that the right has been 
knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived may it accept a 
stipulation to an element of an offense .  Id.  No such colloquy 
occurred here.  Indeed, the present case underscores the vital 
role played by the colloquy .  There is no indication in the 
record that Ui understood that the stipulated facts  her counsel 
agreed to had the effect of conclusively establish ing one of the 
two elements of an offense with which she was charged.  The 
district court therefore erred in accepting  Ui’s stipulation .   
C. The District Court’s Plain Error Warrants Reversal.  
  When necessary  to serve the ends of justice , this 
court will consider  issues that have not been preserved below or  
raised on appeal.  See State v. Kahalewai , 56 Haw. 481, 491, 541 
P.2d 1020, 1027 (1975) ; Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP)  
Rule 52(b) (2016) ( allowing  plain error to be noticed although 
not brought to attention of trial court); Hawaii Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4) (201 0) (permitting 
point of error not presented on appeal  to be noticed as plain 
error); HRAP Rule 40.1(d)(1) (201 5) (allowing question not ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 23 raised to be noticed as plain error ).  It is “firmly 
established” that the relevant inquiry when evaluating whether a 
trial court’s plain error may be noticed is whether the error 
affected substantial rights.16  State v. Miller , 122 Hawai i 92, 
100, 223 P.3d 157, 165 (2010) ; see also  HRPP Rule 52(b) (“ Plain 
error.  Plain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may 
be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of 
the court.”).  Thus, a reviewing court has discretion to correct 
plain error when the error is “not harmless  beyond a reasonable 
doubt.”17  State v. Nichols , 111 Hawai i 327, 335, 141 P.3d 974, 
982 (2006); see also Miller , 122 Hawai i at 130, 223 P.3d at 195; 
HRPP Rule 52(a) (2016 ) (“Harmless error.  Any error, defect, 
                         
 16 The State’s supplemental brief analyzed this case under the 
federal plain error standard set forth in United States v. Olano , 507 U.S. 
725 (1993).  However, a s the State concedes, this court expressly declined to 
adopt the four- pronged Olano standard in State v. Nichols , 111 Hawai i 327, 
335, 141 P.3d 974, 982 (2006).  We reaffirm our holding in Nichols and do not 
address the State’s arguments that rely on Olano. 
 17 The State appears to suggest that a different standard for 
measuring harmless error should apply here because the failure of the 
district court to engage Ui in a Murray colloquy was not “constitutional 
error per se.”  “Because a defendant may not be c onvicted of an offense 
except upon proof establishing his or her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, we 
question whether a standard more lenient than the harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt standard is ever appropriate in criminal cases.”  State v. 
Malufau, 80 Hawaii 126, 131, 906 P.2d 612, 617, order on reconsideration  
(1995); see also State v. Holbron , 80 Hawai i 27, 32 n.12, 904 P.2d 912, 917  
n.12 (1995) (“To the extent that this language . . . implies a standard of 
review under HRPP 52(a) other than ‘harmless beyond a reasonable doubt,’ we 
expressly disapprove and overrule it.”); State v. Chun , 93 Hawai i 389, 393, 4 
P.3d 523, 527 (App. 2000) (holding all errors in criminal cases are subject 
to harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard).  Our precedent rejects the 
distinction asserted by the State of “constitutional error per se” versus 
non-constitutional errors.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 24 irregularity or variance which does not affect substantial 
rights shall be disregarded. ”). 
  The right to have all elements of a charged offense 
proven beyond a reasonable doubt is rooted not only in statutory 
and constitutional law, bu t also in the presumption of innocence 
that is the very foundation of our criminal justice system.  We 
held in Murray that the right was of such fundamental importance 
that an on-the- record colloquy is required to protect against 
its wrongful deprivation.  116 Hawai i at 10, 12, 169 P.3d at 
962, 964 (citing U.S. Const. amend. XIV ; Haw. Const. art. I, § 
5).  By not engaging Ui in this colloquy, the district court may 
have deprived Ui of the fundamental right that the colloquy  was 
designed to protect.   The error thus potentially affected rights 
that were not only substantial, but  also fundamental.  
  In assessing whether an error is harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt, we must determine whether there is a 
reasonable possibility that the error contributed to the 
conviction.  State v. Nofoa , 135 Hawai i 220, 229, 349 P.3d 327, 
336 (2015).  If there is a r easonable possibility that the error 
contributed to the conviction, “the error is not harmless beyond 
a reasonable doubt , and the conviction must be set aside. ”  Id. 
(citing State v. Gano , 92 Hawaii 161, 176, 988 P.2d 1153, 1168 
(1999)).   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 25   The State con tends that the stipulation did not affect 
the outcome of the trial since both Wong and Ui testified as to 
Ui’s level of intoxication.   Although Ui and Wong’s testimony 
did reflect the number and type of alcoholic beverages that Ui  
consumed, there is nothing in the record indicating Ui’s height 
or weight or the anticipated rate of alcohol dissipation for a 
person with Ui’s physical attributes.  In the absence of such 
information, there is nothing from which a reasonable trier of 
fact could infer Ui’s  numerical blood alcohol concentration  at 
the time of the accident other than the  stipulation.18  See State 
v. Nakamitsu, No. CAAP –14–0001151, 2016 WL 381475, at *13 (H aw. 
App. Jan. 29, 2016), aff’d, 140 Hawai i 157 (2017)  (holding that, 
without test results, insufficient evidence existed to support 
defendant’s conviction for driving with breath alcohol content  
over the legal limit  despite ample evidence of defendant’s 
impairment, including testimony that defendant crashed into 
                         
 18 Because the State did not allege in its initial complaint the 
requisite mens rea for the OVUII charge based on Ui’s impairment under HRS § 
291E-61(a)(1), Ui’s OVUII conviction could be based only on a violation of 
HRS § 291E- 61(a)(4), which requires a showing that Ui’s BAC was over the 
specified limit.  See  State v. Apollonio, 130 Hawai i 353, 359, 311 P.3d 676, 
682 (2013) (“A charge that fails to charge a requisite state of mind cannot 
be construed reasonably to state an offense and thus the charge is dismissed 
without prejudice because it violates due process.”  (citing State v. Elliott , 
77 Hawai i 309, 313, 884 P.2d 372, 376 (1994))); State v. Nesmith , 127 Hawai i 
48, 58-61, 276 P.3d 617,  627-30 (2012) (holding  that HRS § 291E- 61(a)(1) 
includes a requisite mens rea element while HRS § 291E -61(a)(4) is a strict 
liability method of proof).  Thus, con trary to the State’s contention,  an 
alternative manner to prove guilt in this case was not available, and the 
stipulation was necessary to prove Ui’s conviction.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 26 light pole, had red eyes and smelled of alcohol, failed field 
sobriety tests, and stumbled and acted erratically  by crying and 
using profanity).   
  Because the erroneously admitted stipulation formed 
the only basis from which a trier of fact could infer Ui’s 
numerical BAC, w e cannot conclude that the district court’s 
error in accepting the stipulation did not contribute to Ui’s 
OVUII conviction.  Accordingly, we hold that the district 
court’s error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  
  In choosing to invoke our discretion ary review  of 
plain errors, we consider whether the record evinces “ errors 
which seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public 
reputation of judicial proceedings .”  Miller, 122 Hawai ʻi at 100, 
223 P.3d at 165 (emphasis omitted)  (quoting State v. Sawyer , 88 
Hawaiʻi 325, 330, 966 P.2d 637, 642 (1998) ).  We will correct 
such errors “to prevent the denial of fundamental rights ”--
regardless of whether the error was brought to the attention of 
the trial judge or raised on appeal.19  Id. (quoting Sawyer, 88 
Hawaii at 330, 966 P.2d at 642).  
                         
 19 The dissent argues that the power to correct plain error should 
be exercised “ sparingly ” and that sua sponte review should be invoked  only in 
“exceptional cases, ” relying on language in State v. Kelekolio, 74 Haw. 479, 
515, 849 P.2d 58, 74- 75 (1993), and State v. Fox , 70 Haw. 46, 56, 760 P.2d 
670, 675- 76 (1988).  Dissent at 7.  This court expressly rejected an 
“exceptional cases” standard in Miller, in which we clarified that “the term 
‘sparingly’ refers to the limitation already in place in HRPP Rule 52(b) that 
 
(continued . . .)  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 27   As stated, the right to have all elements of an 
offense proven beyond a reasonable doubt is rooted in structural  
principles underlying criminal justice.  The potential wrongful 
denial of the presumption of innocence casts doubt upon  the 
integrity of the system as a whole.   In light of th is 
foundational importance , invoking plain error review is 
appropriate under these circumstances .  See State v. Staley , 91 
Hawaii 275, 286 -87, 982 P.2d 904, 915 -16 (1999) ( holding it was 
plain error for trial court to fail to  engage defendant in a 
colloquy prior to accepting defendant’s waiver of fundamental 
right to testify); State v. Davia, 87 Hawai i 249, 255, 953 P.2d 
1347, 1353 (1998) (holding it was plain error for trial court to 
fail to engage defendant in a colloquy prior to acceptin g 
defendant’s no contest plea);  Miller, 122 Hawaiʻi at 116, 223 
P.3d at 181 ( holding plain error review is appropriate when 
errors affect the fairness, integrity, or public perception of 
judicial proceeding s (citing State v. Fox , 70 Haw. 46, 56, 760 
P.2d 670, 676 (1988) )).   
                                                                               
(. . . continued) 
 
the error must be one ‘affecting substantial rights .’”  122 Hawai i at 117, 
223 P.3d at 182.  We reaffirm Miller’s holding that “wher e plain error has 
been committed and substantial rights have been affected thereby , the better 
part of discretion is to invoke the plain error rule.”  Id. (quotations and 
brackets omitted). ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 28   The State and the dissent contend that State v. Pratt , 
127 Hawai i 206, 277 P.3d 300 (2012),  forecloses plain error 
review under the circumstances  of this case .  Dissent at 9 -11.  
However, we held in Pratt that it was not plain error for a 
court to fail to engage a defendant in a Murray colloquy when 
the trial had occurred before this court had decided Murray and 
established the colloquy requirement.  127 Hawai i at 212, 277 
P.3d at 306 .  In contrast, the present case centers on a trial 
court’s failure to implement  clearly established law.   
  The dissent interprets Pratt to suggest that plain 
error review of a trial court’s failure to conduct a Murray 
colloquy is inappropriate when c ounsel’s statements  suggest the 
defendant initiated or participated  in the decision to stipulate 
to an element of the offense .  Dissent at 9 -11.  This approach 
is misframed as a plain error standard, and it amounts to 
inferring the voluntariness and knowingness of a defendant’s 
waiver of fundamental rights from the statements of defense 
counsel.  Respectfully, such a rule is plainly  inconsistent with 
our precedents.   
  This court has often stated expressly  that the 
“[w]aiver of a defendant ’s fundamental rights . . . must come 
directly from the defendant. ”  Murray , 116 Hawaii at 10, 169 
P.3d at 962 (emphasis added); accord State v. Ibuos, 75 Haw. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 29 118, 121, 857 P.2d 576, 578 (1993).  A waiver by defense counsel 
on the defendant’s behalf is insufficient.   State v. Young , 73 
Haw. 217, 221, 830 P.2d 512 , 514 (1992) (“[I]t is the defendant  
who must make the waiver , upon being well informed of his right 
to trial by jury.”  (emphasis added)) ; accord Ibuos , 75 Haw. at 
120 n.1, 857 P.2d at 577 n.1 ; State v. Gomez- Lobato, 130 Hawaii 
465, 481, 312 P.3d 897, 913 (2013)  (Acoba, J., concurring).  
Indeed, we have expressly refused to speculate  regarding the 
substance of privileged communications surrounding a waiver, as 
the dissent would have us do here , stating that “a court may not 
rely upon an off-the -record discussion between counsel and a 
defendant to establish a valid waiver of a  constitutional  
right.”  State v. Eduwensuyi , 141 Hawaii 328, 336, 409 P.3d 732, 
740 (2018). 
  We have even declined to find a knowing, intelligent, 
and voluntary waiver of fundamental rights when the defendant 
personally signs a written form or the court engages the 
defendant in an incomplete or deficient colloquy --neither of 
which occurred in this case .  See, e.g. , id.; State v. Baker , 
132 Hawai i 1, 7, 319 P.3d 1009, 1015 (2014) ; Gomez-Lobato , 130 
Hawaii at 472-73, 312 P.3d at 904-05.  And we have often invoked 
plain error review in doing so .  See, e.g. , State v. Ichimura , 
SCWC-13-0000396, 2017 WL 2590858, at *7 (Haw. June 15, 2017); ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 30 Gomez-Lobato, 130 Hawaii at 469 n.4, 312 P.3d at 901 n.4.; see 
also State v. Vaitogi , 59 Haw. 592,  593 n.4,  594, 585 P.2d 1259,  
1260 n.4, 1261 (1978)  (holding it was plain error for the trial 
court to fail to engage the defendant in an on -the-record 
colloquy prior to accepting a guilty plea).  
  Our precedents do not permit a reviewing court to 
infer that a fundamental right was knowingly, voluntarily, and 
intelligently relinquished by a defendant simply because defense 
counsel suggested that the right was so waived .  Given the 
complete lack of an on-the-record colloquy and personal waiver 
in this case, we conclude that the trial court plainly erred.  
IV. CONCLUSION  
  We hold that the district court plainly erred in 
failing to conduct an on -the-record colloquy as required by our 
decision in Murray .  Thus, the court also erred in accepting the 
stipulation as evidence proving  that Ui’s BAC was .08 or more 
grams of alcohol per one hundred milliliters or cubic 
centimeters of blood .  The district court’s error was not 
harmless, and the stipulation regarding Ui’s  blood test must be 
set aside.  Accordingly, the ICA’s June 30, 2016 Judgment on 
Appeal is affirmed in part and vacated in part .  We affirm the 
ICA’s Judgment on Appeal to the extent that it vacated Ui’s 
conviction under HRS § 286-102(b) and remand ed to the district ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 31 court with instructions to dismiss the HRS § 286 -102(b) charge 
without prejudice.  We vacate  the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal to 
the extent that it affirmed Ui’s conviction under HRS § 291E-
61(a)(4) and also vacate Ui’s district court  conviction for this 
offense, and the case is remanded to the district court for 
further proceedings .
