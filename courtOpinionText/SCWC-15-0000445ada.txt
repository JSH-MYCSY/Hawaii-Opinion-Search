OPINION OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J.       
 
 
  
 
   
 The Royal Aloha condominium is a mixed-use residential and 
commercial project located in Waikīkī. It employed Chaney 
Brooks as its managing agent from 1995 to 2002, and CMI as its managing agent from 2003-2010.  Bruser and TJI were the owners 
of commercial unit C-1.  The McCormacks were the owners of 
commercial unit C-2.  The AOAO installed an electricity 
submetering system in 1998 and hired electrical engineers to 
read each unit’s electricity submeter, then submit the readings 
to the managing agent, who would bill each owner for electricity. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
I. Introduction 
This case arises out of a dispute between the Association 
of Apartment Owners of Royal Aloha (“AOAO”); its former property managers, Certified Management, Inc. (“CMI”) and Chaney Brooks & 
Co. (“Chaney Brooks”); and its former commercial tenants, 
Michael D. Bruser, Tokyo Joe’s, Inc. (“TJI”), and Michael and 
Signa McCormack. As the facts in this case are not disputed, 
they are taken from the Circuit Court of the First Circuit’s 
(“circuit court”) background section in its “Amended Conclusions 
of Law, and Order Granting Defendant Certified Management’s 
Motion for Summary Judgment, Filed 8/5/14 and Order Granting 
Joinder by: Defendant Chaney Brooks & Company, LLC to Defendant 
Certified Management, Inc. ’s Motion for Summary Judgment, Filed 
8/12/14.”

   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Between 1998 and 2010, the commercial tenants of C-1 were 
never billed for electricity, and the commercial tenants of C-2 
were erroneously billed for a portion of C-1’s electricity 
costs. 
The AOAO sued CMI and Chaney Brooks for, inter alia, breach 
of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and negligence, for the 
billing errors. The AOAO also sued the commercial tenants to 
recover hundreds of thousands of dollars in unbilled or 
erroneously billed electricity costs. 
The circuit court granted the property management 
companies’ motion for summary judgment based on the doctrine of 
laches. The circuit court also granted Bruser and TJI’s 
(commercial tenants of C-1) motion for partial summary judgment, 
concluding that the commercial tenants had no obligation to 
indemnify the AOAO for electricity costs. The circuit court 
later amended its order granting the property management 
companies’ MSJ so that all claims against a ll defendants were 
barred under the doctrine of laches. 
The AOAO appealed. 
The ICA issued a published opinion 
holding that “the defense of laches, as a matter of law, applies 
only to equitable claims,” reversing the grant of summary 
judgment in the defen dants’ favor. Ass’n of Apartment Owners of 
Royal Aloha v. Certified Mgmt., Inc. , 138 Hawai i 276, 283

 Petitioners/Defendants-Appellees CMI, Chaney Brooks, 
Bruser, TJI, and the McCormacks (collectively, the Joint 
Defendants) present the following questions in their Joint 
1Application for Writ of Certiorari :  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 We accepted certiorari and now hold that laches is a 
defense at law and at equity, contrary to the ICA’ s holding that 
laches is a defense in equity only.  
 
 
  
 On April 13, 2012, the AOAO filed a Complaint against 
property managers CMI and Chaney Brooks, and commercial tenants 
  
1                      *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
A. Whether the ICA gravely erred by holding, “We agree 
with the AOAO’s contention that the defense of laches, as a 
matter of law, applies only to equitable claims” – a 
contention never raised by the AOAO in Circuit Court which 
Petitioners pointed out in their Answering Brief. 
B. Whether the ICA gravely erred by condoning or failing 
to recognize that the AOAO had materially misstated the 
Record on Appeal by falsely stating that the AOAO in 
Circuit Court objected to “using laches to dismiss legal 
claims” 
–  despite the fact that Petitioners pointed out 
this misrepresentation in their Answering Brief.  
C. Whether Hawai i law, HRAP Rule 28, and the doctrine of 
waiver precluded the ICA from basing its Opinion on the 
AOAO’s laches contention – which the AOAO failed to 
preserve, and did not involve a jurisdictional issue or plain error. 
D. Whether Hawai i law, federal decisions, authority cited 
in the Opinion, and public policy are contrary to the ICA’s 
holding that “the defense of laches, as a matter of law, 
applies only to equitable claims.” 
II. Background 
A. Circuit Court Proceedings 
1. Complaint and Answers 
4
 Chaney Brooks filed a joinder to the Joint Application. Bruser, Tokyo 
Joe’s, Inc., Michael T. McCormack, and Signa S. McCormack also filed a 
joinder to the Joint Application.        
 
 
  
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Bruser, TJI, and the McCormacks due to the unbilled or 
erroneously billed electricity costs. The AOAO alleged the 
following against either or both of CMI and Chaney Brooks: 
breach of contract (Count I), breach of fiduciary duty (Count 
II), and negligence (Count III).  The AOAO alleged the following 
claims only against CMI: negligent misrepresentation (Count IV) 
and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing (Count 
V). The AOAO also included the following claims against the 
commercial tenants Bruser, TJI, and the McCormacks’ trusts: 
indemnification (Count VI) and unjust enrichment (Count VII). Lastly, the AOAO raised claims for surety and guaranty 
obligations (Count VIII) and declaratory relief (Count IX) 
against Bruser, the McCormacks, and the McCormack trusts.  The 
AOAO filed its First Amended Complaint three days later, raising 
the same claims. 
Defendant Chaney Brooks filed its Answer, denying the 
allegations raised in Counts I and II in the Complaint, and raising the defense of laches. Defendant CMI also filed its 
Answer, denying the allegations raised in all of the counts of 
the Complaint, raising the defense of unclean hands, and giving 
notice that it would assert other defenses constituting 
affirmative defenses as set forth in Hawaii Rules of Civil 
Procedure Rule 8(c) as the matter progressed. The commercial 
tenants filed their Answer, denying the allegations raised in 
5
      
 
 
   
    
 
 
  
  
 Around the same time that Bruser and TJI filed their second 
motion for partial summary judgment, CMI filed its motion for 
summary judgment, asking the circuit court to dismiss all claims 
against it based on the doctrine of laches. It argued that the 
AOAO knew of the incomplete and incorrect electricity billings 
around 2000-2002 and waited 10-12 years to bring its lawsuit.  
CMI argued that the AOAO’s delay was unreasonable and resulted 
in severe prejudice to CMI, as “[c]ritical witnesses have died, 
critical facts cannot be recalled by those witnesses who have *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
all of the counts of the Complaint, and raising the defense of 
laches. 
2. Bruser and TJI’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment 
Bruser and TJI filed a motion for partial summary judgment 
[50:765-91], arguing that the AOAO was obligated to bill them 
the electricity costs but never had; therefore, Bruser and TJI 
were not responsible for paying the unbilled electricity costs, 
and the AOAO could not seek indemnification from them under 
Section 6.02 of the Bylaws for the same. Chaney Brooks and CMI 
joined in the motion for partial summary judgment. The circuit 
court granted Bruser and T JI’s motion for partial summary 
judgment. It also dismissed the rest of the claims against Bruser and TJI (i.e., restitution/unjust enrichment and quasi-
surety and guaranty) on the grounds of estoppel and laches. 
3. CMI’s Motion for Summary Judgment 
6
      
 
 
  CMI acknowledged that this court, in dictum, “cited case 
law concerning whether laches bar legal claims, independent of 
the statute of limitations.” CMI was referring to Ass’n of 
Apartment Owners of Newtown Meadows v. Venture 15, Inc. , 115 
Hawaii 232, 284, 167 P.3d 225, 227 (2007). CMI also cited to 
27A Am. Jur. 2d Equity § 117 (2014) for the following: “While some states without separate law and equity courts nevertheless 
hold laches inapplicable to legal actions, laches increasingly 
is applied to actions at law, such as actions seeking only 
damages.” CMI noted that law and equity have merged in Hawai i, 
as recognized in the Hawai i Rules of Civil Procedure (Rule 2 
sets forth only “one form of action to be known as a ‘civil 
action.’”). According to CMI, in other jurisdictions where law 
and equity have merged, the defense of laches is applicable to legal claims as well as equitable claims. Specifically, CMI 
cited Bill v. Bd. of Educ. of Cicero School Dist. 99 , 812 N.E.2d 
604, 613 (Ill. App. 2004); Teamsters & Employers Welfare Trust 
of Ill. v. Gorman Bros. Ready Mix, 283 F.3d 877, 881 (7th Cir. 
2002); Danjaq LLC v. Sony Corp.  , 263 F.3d 942, 955 (9th Cir. 
2001); Telink, Inc. v. U.S. , 24 F.3d 42, 45 (9th Cir. 1994); *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
not passed away, and voluminous documents and records have been 
destroyed or purged.”  
7

      
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The circuit court concluded that the AOAO’s delay in bringing  
its lawsuit was unreasonable, as it knew that electricity was 
not being billed to the commercial tenants in 2001 or 2001 but 
waited 10 years to file its Complaint. The circuit court also 
concluded that the AOAO’s unreasonable delay caused severe and 
pervasive prejudice to the defendants due to evidentiary 
challenges, because Chaney Brooks had long since purged its *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
A.C. Aukerman Co. v. R.L. Chaides Constr. Co. , 960 F.2d 1020, 
1029 (Fed. Cir. 1992). 
Chaney Brooks joined in CMI’s MSJ. 
The AOAO’s memorandum 
in opposition counter-argued that the AOAO’s delay in bringing 
suit was not unreasonable, and that CMI’s unclean hands rendered 
its laches defense unavailable. The AOAO did not address CMI’s 
contention that laches is a defense at law and at equity. 
The circuit 
court granted CMI’s motion for summary judgment 
and Chaney Brooks’ joinder thereto. The circuit court later amended its order granting summary judgment solely to note that 
summary judgment was granted against the AOAO on all claims, in 
favor of 
all defendants.  Relevant to this appeal, the circuit 
court concluded the following: 
2. Hawaii recognizes laches as an affirmative defense. 
Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 8(c). Laches 
applies to actions at law in states like Hawai i, which have 
merged law and equity courts. See  HRCP Rule 1, Rule 2, 
Rule 8(c); Assoc. of Apt. Owners of Newtown Meadows v. 
 Venture 15, Inc. , 115 Hawaii 232, 284 (2007) (analyzing 
laches in an action in law).  
8

      
 
 
  
 Relevant to this appeal, the AOAO raised the following 
point of error: “Whether the Circuit Court committed reversible 
error in applying the equitable defense of laches as the sole 
basis for the dismissal of the AOAO’s legal claims against CBC, 
CMI, BRUSER and the MCCORMACKS?” The AOAO argued that laches is 
an equitable defense and not applicable to actions at law. In 
support of this argument, the AOAO cited to Adair v. Hustace , 64 
Haw. 314, 320-21, 640 P.2d 294, 300 (1982), for the following proposition: Laches “acts to bar a court from considering an equitable action . . . Just as the statute of limitations 
establishes the requisite degree for actions at law, so is 
laches the rule for equitable actions.” The AOAO also cited the 
following cases from the United States Court of Appeals for the 
Eighth Circuit, confining laches to equitable claims: Ashley v. 
Boyle’s Famous Corned Beef Co. , 66 F.3d 164, 170 (8th Cir. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Royal Aloha documents, there was no written agreement regarding 
submetered electricity billing, several critical witnesses had 
died in the interim, and those who remained did not remember 
details about the submetered electricity billing. The circuit 
court initially filed its Final Judgment on May 5, 2015, then 
its Amended Final Judgment in favor of all defendants against 
the AOAO on June 25, 2015.  The AOAO timely appealed. 
B. ICA Appeal 
9
      
 
 
   
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
1995), and Sandobal v. Armour & Co. , 429 F.3d 249, 256 (8th Cir. 
1970). 
In their Joint 
Answering Brief (filed by all of the 
defendants), the defendants counter-argued that the AOAO had 
waived any argument that laches did not apply to actions at law, 
for failure to raise this argument before the circuit court. In 
its Reply, the AOAO did not address the Defendants’ contention 
that it had waived the argument that laches is an equitable, not 
legal, defense. 
In a published opinion, the ICA agreed with the AOAO and 
held that “the defense of laches, as a matter of law, applies 
only to equitable 
claims.” Ass’n of Apartment Owners of Royal 
Aloha
, 138 Hawai i at 283-84, 378 P.3d at 999-1000 (footnote 
omitted). The ICA recognized, in a footnote, that “both state 
and federal courts ‘are divided on whether laches applies only 
to equitable actions or applies also to actions at law.’” 138 
Hawaii at 282 n.6, 378 P.3d at 998 n.6 (citing 27A Am. Jur. 2d 
Equity § 117).   The ICA cited to 27A Am. Jur. 2d Equity § 117 
for the following proposition: “Some courts state that laches 
is usually available only in suits strictly in equity or in 
actions at law that involve claims of an essentially equitable 
character.” 138 Hawai i at 283, 378 P.3d at 998. The ICA then 
cited to Wells Fargo Bank v. Bank of America , 38 Cal. Rptr. 2d 
10

      
 
 
  After vacating, in part, the circuit court’s grant of 
summary judgment to defendants on the basis of laches, the ICA 
remanded this case to the circuit court to consider “whether 
some of the separately metered electricity usage costs were 
billed or charged, and suit filed, within the applicable statute 
of limitations periods.” 138 Hawai i at 286-87, 378 P.3d at 
1002-03.  
 
 Whether laches is a defense available in an action of law 
is a question of law reviewable de novo. See Chirco v.  
Crosswinds Communities, Inc. , 474 F.3d 227, 230 (6th Cir. 2007) 
(“[W]hen a reviewing court is presented with a threshold 
question of law as to whether the laches doctrine is even *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
521, 530 (Cal. Ct. App. 1995), a California case holding that, 
although declaratory relief is generally an action in equity, 
whether laches applies in such actions depends upon the nature 
of the underlying claim. 138 Hawai i at 283, 378 P.3d at 998.   
The ICA then considered the AOAO’s action to be essentially an 
action at law, as it sought primarily money damages against all 
of the defendants, and the declaratory relief sought was a 
judicial determination that certain defendants breached their 
contractual obligations, which is a legal claim. See id.    
Therefore, reasoned the ICA, laches did not apply in this case, which raised, at bottom, legal claims. See id.   
III. Standard of Review 
11

      
 
 
  
 
 The Joint Defendants’ first three q uestions presented all 
concern whether the AOAO waived the argument that the laches 
defense applies only to equitable proceedings, and, therefore, 
whether the ICA gravely erred in addressing the issue. Despite 
any failure of the AOAO to raise this argument before the circuit court, the ICA properly addressed the issue on a de novo 
review of the circuit court’s order granting summary judgment in 
favor of defendants due to laches. 
See, e.g., Hawai i Cmty. Fed. 
Credit Union v. Keka , 94 Hawai i 213, 221, 11 P.3d 1, 9 (2000) 
(“We review [a] circuit court’s [grant or denial] of summary 
judgment de novo    under the same standard applied by the circuit 
court.”) (brackets in original, citation omitted). The circuit 
court issued a conclusion of law that laches applied to the 
AOAO’s legal claims. The issue of the applicability of the 
laches defense is a legal one, which appellate courts also 
review de novo  .  See, e.g., Chirco, 474 F.3d at 230; Ditto, 90 
Hawaii at 351, 978 P.2d at 789 (“Questions of law are reviewable  
de novo  under the right/wrong standard.”)  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
applicable in a particular situation, . . . [its] review is de 
novo.”); Ditto v. McCurdy , 90 Hawai i 345, 351, 978 P.2d 783, 789 
(1999) (noting questions of law are reviewable de novo, under 
the right/wrong standard). 
IV. Discussion 
12
      
 
 
  The fundamental issue in this case is contained in the 
fourth question presented: whether the ICA gravely erred in 
holding that “the defense of laches, as a matter of law, applies 
only to equitable claims.” I n Adair, 64 Haw. at 320-21, 640 
P.2d at 300, this court summarized the doctrine of laches in 
Hawaii as follows:  
 The doctrine of laches reflects the equitable maxim 
that “equity aids the vigilant, not those who slumber on 
their rights.” Where applicable,  it acts to bar a court 
from considering an equitable action . . . because of a 
perception that it is more equitable to defendants and 
important to society to promote claimant diligence, 
discourage delay and prevent the enforcement of stale 
claims.  
 There are two components to laches, both of which 
must exist before the doctrine will apply. First, there must have been a delay by the plaintiff in bringing his 
claim, and that delay must have been unreasonable under the 
circumstances. Delay is reasonable if the claim was brought without undue delay after plaintiff knew of the 
wrong or knew of facts and circumstances sufficient to 
impute such knowledge to him. Second, that delay must have 
resulted in prejudice to defendant. Common but by no means 
exclusive examples of such prejudice are loss of evidence 
with which to contest plaintiff’s claims, including the 
fading memories or deaths or material witnesses, changes in 
the value of the subject matter, changes in defendant’s 
position, and intervening rights of third parties.  
 
 
 In its published opinion, to support its holding that the 
defense of laches applies only to equitable claims, the ICA 
quoted Adair, and on its face, Adair  appears to confine the 
defense of laches to equitable claims only, but two subsequent opinions from this court have called that limitation into 
question. First, in Newtown Meadows
, 115 Hawai i at 284, 167 
P.3d at 277, this court had the opportunity to ad dress an AOAO’s *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(Citations and footnote omitted.) 
13
      
 
 
  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
express argument that, because its negligence suit for damages 
was an action “[exclusively in law, not in equity[,] . . . the 
timeliness of suit is governed by law, as set forth in the 
applicable statute of limitations, not by equity and la ches.” 
This court declined to expressly hold that laches applied in equity only and went on to state, “even assuming arguendo that 
laches governs the timeliness of the AOAO’s assertion of its 
negligence claims against [one of the defendants], [that 
defendant] has failed to present to this court any evidence of 
prejudice caused by the claimed unreasonable delay.” 
Id.   This 
court then held “that the circuit court did not err in denying 
[that defendant’s] motion for summary judgment on the AOAO’s 
negligence claims based on laches.” 115 Hawai i at 285, 167 P.3d 
at 278. Thus, there is precedent for the application of laches 
to an action at law, even though this court did not outright 
hold that the defense of laches applied to equitable and legal 
claims. 
Second, in a footnote in Thomas v. Kidani , 126 Hawai
i 125, 
131 n.6, 267 P.3d 1230, 1236 n.6 (2011), this court acknowledged 
that Adair held that the statute of limitations applies to legal 
actions, and laches applies to equitable actions. The court 
then noted that the plaintiff in the Thomas case “d[id] not 
explain the applicability of the equitable doctrine of laches to 
her legal action for fraud.” Id.  This court nonetheless went 
14

      
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
on, as in  Newtown Meadows , to “analyze [the plaintiff’s] 
argument assuming, b ut not deciding, applicability.” Id.  Both 
Newtown Meadows and Thomas 
expressly acknowledged that there 
exists a question as to whether laches is a defense to legal 
claims and expressly left open the answer. 
In answering the question, the ICA decided 
that laches was 
not a defense to a legal claim, and, in its analysis, quoted a 
portion of a legal encyclopedia, 27A Am. Jur. 2d. Equity § 117, 
for the following proposition: “Some courts state that laches 
is usually available only in suits strictly in equity or in 
actions at law that involve claims of an essentially equitable 
character.” Ass’n of Apartment Owners of Royal Aloha , 138 
Hawai
i at 283, 378 P.3d at 998. As the Joint Defendants point 
out in their application, however, the complete quotation reads 
as follows (with emphasis on language omitted): 
In jurisdictions that have retained separate courts of law 
and equity, the laches defense may be cognizable only in 
courts of equity and may be available only where equitable relief is sought. Laches thus only applies to defeat 
equitable actions, not actions at law. Laches particularly 
does not apply to actions for damages or the recovery of 
money or property fraudulently obtained. Likewise, in some 
states where courts have equity and chancery sides, laches 
may not apply to legal actions, which include declaratory 
judgment actions or claims for damages for nonperformance 
of a contract.
  
While some states without separate law and equity courts 
nevertheless hold laches inapplicable to legal actions, 
laches is increasingly applied to actions at law, such as  
actions seeking only damages.
  Some courts state that 
laches is usually available only in suits strictly in 
equity or in actions at law that involve claims of an 
essentially equitable character. 
15
      
 
 
  The Joint Defendants’ argument is persuasive. Law and 
equity merged under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 
(“FRCP”) in 1938. See Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp. , 527 U.S. 815, 
846 (1999). Since that time, in the federal courts on the civil 
side, “There is one form of action —-  the civil action.” Hawai i 
adopted the Hawai i Rules of Civil Procedure (“HRCP”), patterned 
after the FRCP, in 1954. See You Dong Men v. Cho Kyung Ai , 41 
Haw. 574, 575 (Haw. Terr. 1957). This court specifically 
recognized the “aboli[tion of] courts of equity and courts of 
law in this jurisdiction,” noting that both have been “merged . 
. . into one ‘court’ which has cognizance over all civil 
matters.” Lau v. Valu-Bilt Homes, Ltd., 59 Haw. 283, 291, 582 
P.2d 195, 201 (1978). This court noted that “there is now no 
distinction between the forms of actions  previously cognizable 
in courts of law or in courts of equity. With the adoption of *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
27A Am. Jur. 2d Equity § 117 (emphasis added and footnote 
omitted). The Joint Defendants argue that, in omitting the 
emphasized language, the ICA’s opinion “rewrites Hawai i law, is 
inconsistent with Hawai i law and better-reasoned federal and 
state case law, and  is contrary to the judicial trend permitting 
laches to apply to all claims –- at least in jurisdictions in 
which courts of equity and law have merged –- which includes 
Hawaii.”   
16

      
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Maksym v. Loesch*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the HRCP, there is now but one form of action called the ‘civil 
action.’ HRCP Rule 2.” 59 Haw. at 291 -92, 582 P.2d at 201.  
This court did go on to state, “These develo pments in the civil 
procedure of our courts, however, do not eliminate the 
substantive principles which differentiate actions of an 
equitable nature from those that are legal in nature.” Id.   
These statements seem to contradict each other and leave open 
the question of whether laches is applicable only in equity or 
at law as well. 
We now hold that laches is a defense in all civil actions, 
in accordance with the modern trend. 
The United States Court of 
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit explained the modern trend to apply laches to legal and equitable claims as follows: 
Laches is an equitable doctrine but one increasingly 
applied in cases at law (such as this case, since the 
plaintiff is seeking only damages) as well. Not only is 
there a long tradition of applying equitable defenses in 
cases at law –-indeed, fraud itself is an equitable 
defense typically interposed in suits at law for breach of 
contract – -but with the merger of law and equity (Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 2) there is no longer a good reason to distinguish between the legal and equitable character of defenses. . .

jurisdictions are in accord. See also   Teamsters, 283 F.3d at 
881 (“[A]s with many equitable defenses, the defense of laches 
is equally available in suits at law.”) (citations omitted);

case law, since early statehood, recognizes the applicati

equitable remedies [in this case, laches] to legal claims.”); 
Bill, 812 N.E.2d at 612 (“While we agree that traditionally, 
statutes of limitations were generally applied to legal actions 
and the laches 
doctrine was applied to those actions based in 
equity, such ‘mechanical’ applications are no longer followed.”) (citation omitted); 
Dep’t of Banking and Finance v. Wilken , 352 
N.W.2d 145, 149 (Neb. 1984) (Holding that the defense of laches 
was applicable in a contract action as follows: “The common -law 
rule is that equitable defenses cannot be used to defeat an 
action at law based on contract; however, we have not accepted 
that position, but, on the contrary, we have held that any 
defense, whether it be legal or equitable, may be set up in any 
case.”) (citations omitted); Moore v. Starcher, 280 S.E.2d 693, 
696 (W.Va. 1981) (“As an equitable concept, this theory is known as laches and it has been infused as well into actions at law.”) 
(citation omitted);
 McDaniel v. Messerschmidt, 382 P.2d 304, 307 
(Kan. 1963) (“Although plaintiff contends the doctrine of laches 
does not apply to pure actions at law, which he claims this to 
be, and applies only to suits in equity, our cases do not 
support his theory.”). We now adopt the rule that laches is a 
defense to any civil action, which includes both legal or 
equitable claims. In this case, the AOAO does not challenge the 
circuit court’s factual findings underlying its conclusion that 
its unreasonable delay prejudiced the defendants. Therefore, we

affirm the circuit court’s order granting summary judgment, on 
the basis of laches, in favor of all the defendants on all of 
the AOAO’s claims.  
V. Conclusion 
We now hold that, in this jurisdiction, laches is a defense 
to legal and equitable claims alike. 
We therefore reverse the 
ICA’s August 24, 2016 Judgment on Appeal, and affirm the circuit 
court’s “Amended Conclusions of Law, and Order Granting 
Defendant Certified Management ’s Motion for Summary Judgment, 
Filed 8/5/14 and Order Granting Joinder by: Defendant Chaney Brooks & Company, LLC to Defendant Certified Management Inc.’s
