OPINION OF THE COURT BY POLLACK, J. 
  This case concerns the propriety of remarks made by a 
prosecutor in closing argument suggesting that opposing counsel 
attempted to induce the complaining witness to give false 
testimony during cross- examination .  There was no evidence in 
the record to support such an allegation, and the prosecutor’s 
statements amounted to an unwarranted attack on the personal Electronically Filed

2 character of defense counsel and, by extension, the defendant.  
The trial court did not rectify the issue through an adequate 
curative instruction, and the evidence against the defendant was 
not so overwhelming that we can conclude beyond a reasonable 
doubt that the allegat ion did not influence the jury’s 
deliberations.  We therefore vacate the defendant’s conviction s 
and remand this case for a new trial. 
I. BACKGROUND 
  On April 15, 2014, Brian Underwood was charged with 
the following offenses: count I, kidnapping in violation of 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-7 20(1)(e);1 count II, 
carrying or use of a firearm in the commission of a separate 
felony in violation of HRS § 134-21;2 and count III , abuse of 
family or household members in violation of HRS § 709-906(1).3  
                     
 1 HRS § 707 -720(1)(e) provides in relevant part: “ (1) A person 
commits the offense of kidnapping if the person intentionally or knowingly 
restrains another person with intent to: . . . (e) Terrorize that person or a 
third person[.]”  HRS § 707 -720(1)(e) (1993) . 
 2 HRS § 134 -21 provides in relevant part as follows:  
(a) It shall be unlawful for a person to knowingly carry on 
the person or have within the person’s immediate control or 
intentionally use or threaten to use a firearm while 
engaged in the commission of a separate felony, whether the 
firearm was loaded or not, and whether operable or not  
HRS § 134- 21 (2011). 
 3 HRS § 709 -906(1) provided in relevant part : “(1) It shall be 
unlawful for any person, singly or in concert, to physically abuse a family 
household member . . . .”  HRS § 709- 906(1) (1993). ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
3 The allegations involved an incident that occurred on April 5, 
2014. 
  A jury trial commenced on March 16, 2015, and the 
following evidence was adduced.4 
  At the time of the incident, the complaining witness 
(CW) lived with Underwood in his two-story apartment on Oahu.  
They had been dating for about ten months and 
living together 
for about three months.  On the evening of April 4, 2014, CW 
received a message through online social media f rom a woman 
living on the mainland who claimed that she was in a 
relationship with Underwood.  A week and a half earlier, CW had 
received a similar communication from a different woman living 
in Australia. 
  CW confronted Underwood about the purported 
relationships, and they ultimately decided that CW would move 
out the next morning.5  After Underwood went to sleep, CW printed 
out the approximately 30 messages she had received from the 
women, including pictures of text conversations between the 
women and Underwood, and placed them in various places 
throughout their bedroom.   
                     
 4 The Honorable Glenn J. Kim presided.  
 5 Underwood offered to pay for a hotel room so that CW  could leave 
immediately, but they decided to wait until the morning because it was 
already very late in the evening.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
4   When Underwood woke up, he and CW began to argue, and 
they moved downstairs to the living room so as to not wake up 
CW’s sister (Sister), who was visiting
 at the time.  CW had a 
box of her belongings on the couch that Underwood threw 
out the 
door onto the front lawn.  Underwood then told CW to take off 
the sweatpants that she was wearing because they belonged to 
him, which CW did and was left wearing only a t- shirt.  
  
CW testified that at some point she found herself on 
the ground, but she stated she could not recall how she got 
there.  Underwood grabbed her ankles and began pulling her 
toward the door, CW stated, and CW called Sister for help.  
Underwood let go of CW before Sister came downstairs .  Sister 
testified that, when she came upon the scene, CW was standing 
and appeared to be frightened and crying.6   
  After putting on a pair of Sister’s  sweatpants,  CW 
went to pick up her belongings from the lawn.  As she was 
packing her belongings, CW felt several objects hit her head.  
Underwood was throwing
 a number of full Gatorade bottles and a 
pair of her high heels at her  from the front door.7   
                     
 6 In a statement that Sister gave to the police the day of the 
incident, she said that Underwood was trying to push CW out the front door.  
During trial, Sister stated that she saw them moving “back and forth” and 
that it appeared that CW was trying to leave, and that Underwood was trying 
to make her stay.  Sister did not testify at trial that she witnessed 
aggressive physical contact betwe en Underwood and CW.  
 7 CW stated that, over the course of the morning, she suffered 
abrasions and bruising to her right leg, scrapings on her left leg, bruising 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
5   Sister assisted picking up CW’s items from the lawn, 
and they left to go to the house of CW’s friend .  While at the 
friend’s home, CW and Underwood had a text message conversation.  
CW asked if she and Sister could come back to the house and get 
CW’s uniform and credentials that she needed for work the next 
day, and Underwood agreed. 
  CW and Sister 
returned to the house and started 
collecting their things.  When they had finished gathering some 
of CW’s belongings into a box, Sister took the box and walked 
out the front door while CW went into the laundry room to look 
for more of her things.  When Sister stepped outside the 
apartment, she heard
 the front door  slam shut behind her.  She 
found that the door was locked, and when CW did not come out 
within a few minutes, Sister began pounding on the front door 
and ringing the doorbell.8  Sister yelled to open the door and 
threatened to call the police.  Eventually CW came running out 
of the house looking scared.  
  CW stated that, w
hile Sister was locked outside the 
apartment, Underwood came to the door of the laundry room 
                                                                  
around her knee and elbow, and soreness on the back of her head.  The 
injuries to her legs and elbow were documented in police photographs taken 
that day.  CW testified that she sustained no injuries to her back or 
buttocks. 
 8 CW explained at trial that if the button on the front door knob 
is engaged, the door automatically locks when it is closed and will not open 
from the outside of the home.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
6 carrying a pillow  that he  then dropped to reveal  he was holding 
a gun.  CW  testified that she could not remember what then 
happened prior to her  running out the door of the apartment 
except that she had walked down the hallway, sat on the couch, 
and begun to cry.   She agreed, however, that she had written in 
her statement to police on the day of the incident that 
Underwood had threatened her with the gun and refused to let her 
leave.  According to Sister, when CW ran out of  the apartment, 
CW told her that Underwood had a gun and was going to kill her 
and insisted they had to leave immediately.   Sister testified 
that during the car ride, CW was crying and panicking and again 
said that Underwood had threatened her with a gun .   
  After  the incident, CW moved to Maui.  She and 
Underwood had periodic contact in June 2014 in an attempt to 
work things out in their relationship.   In October 2014, they 
began to have contact again , and on multiple occasions between 
October and February or March,  CW flew to Oʻahu to see Underwood.   
During this time, CW and Underwood spoke about Underwood’s case 
and her testifying in court, although CW  stated that she did not 
remember what was said.   CW testified she was no longer in a 
relationship with Underwood  but she still loved him and wanted 
what was best for him.   
  During cross- examination , Underwood’s  counsel asked CW 
about whether she had kicked Underwood during the incident.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
7 Q. [Defense Counsel] Why do you care if he’s having 
relationships with other women?  
A. [CW] Because I’m in a relationship with him.  I’m living 
with him, and we’ve talked about it before.  He said he 
wasn’t having an y relationships.  
Q. And that angered you?  
A. I was upset about it.  I was hurt.  
Q. You went downstairs, right?  
A. Yes. 
Q. And you began talking to Mr. Underwood, right?  
A. I don’t remember what was said.  
Q. But you – my question was you began talking to Mr. 
Underwood, correct?  
A. Yes. 
Q. And there was a conversation going on, right?  
A. Yes. 
Q. And you became angry at him, right?  
A. I wasn’t angry with him.  
Q. Then at some point, you came up to him and got in his 
face, correct?  
A. No. 
Q. And then at some point you kicked him?  
A. No. 
Q. Correct? You attempted to kick him, correct?  
A. No. 
Q. At some point you fell on the ground, correct?  
A. I was on the ground.  I’m not sure how I got there.  
Q. Well, he didn’t push you down, right?  
A. I don’t remember how I got to the ground.  
Q. Well, if he had pushed you down, you would certainly 
remember it, right?  
A. I’m not sure.  
Q. In any event, you go to the ground somehow?  
A. That’s correct.  
  In closing argument , the State contend ed that the case 
was essentially about Underwood’s need to “control” CW.  The 
State noted that CW had said she and Underwood had spoken about 
the case, and the State argued that CW was “intimidated ” into 
hiding the truth as a consequence of those conversations.  The 
State then asserted that Underwood’s  counsel tried to get CW to 
fabricate her testimony:   
[Prosecutor]: Now, [CW] , on Monday, was honest about the 
fact that the defendant had dragged her through the house 
and caused those bruises because she knows that there’s 
these pictures.   She can’t hide that.  She can’t deny the 
injuries.  The defense attorney tried to get 
[CW] to make ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
8 up some story about how she tried to kick the defendant and 
she fell back .  
[Defense counsel]: Objection.  Mischaracterizes the 
evidence.  
THE COURT: Overruled.  
(Emphasis added.)  The prosecutor made further statements 
about defense counsel: 
[Prosecutor]: She doesn’t want to admit [what the defendant 
did to her] because she told you she got back together with 
the defendant.  They talked about this case, so she took 
the middle ground.  She tried to say, “I don’t remember.”  
She never denied it, not once.  And the defense attorney
 
tried to push [CW] on cross- examination ; tried to get her 
to say or admit that she tried to kick the defendant .  And 
you saw her demeanor on the stand when that happened.  She 
got a little insulted.  She was a little upset.  He pushed 
her too far, and she slipped out of that protective mode.  
(Emphasis added.)  The State concluded by urging the jury to 
“[e]nd 
[Underwood’s] manipulation” by finding him guilty as 
charged. 
  The jury found Underwood guilty of the lesser included 
offense of unlawful imprisonment in the second degree in c
ount 
I, not guilty in count II of carrying or use of firearm in the 
commission of a separate felony, and guilty of abuse of family 
or household members in count III.  
  Underwood filed a motion for new trial, arguing at the 
hearing that the prosecutor had improperly sought to bolster the 
State’s witnesses by asserting to the jury tha t the “defense 
attorney tried to get [CW]  to make up some story about --  she ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
9 tried to kick the defendant, and she fell back.”9  The court 
denied the motion for new trial. 
  T he circuit court sentenced Underwood to one year of 
probation in count I and two years of probation in count III, 
the terms to run concurrently, including seven days of 
incarceration as a special condition of probation.  The court 
entered its Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence 
(Judgment) on May 27, 2015.  Underwood timely appealed from the 
Judgment to the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA). 
II. ICA PROCEEDINGS 
 
  Before the ICA, Underwood contended
 that the 
prosecuting attorney committed misconduct during closing 
argument when the prosecutor accused defense counsel of 
soliciting CW to fabricate testimony and thereby violated 
Underwood’s constitutional right to a fair trial .10  Underwood 
stated that in determining prosecutorial misconduct, the court 
                     
 9 The defense counsel stated the following to the court 
regarding the prosecutor’s accusation that he had “tried to get [CW] to 
make up some story.” 
Your Honor, I never tried to get [CW] to make up any story.  
I never had any conversations with [CW] that would allow me 
to do that.  And there was no evidence presented to the 
jury that should be in any way tainting my credibility and 
therefore the defendant ’s credibility as well.  That ties 
in directly with the prosecution ’s argument that Mr. 
Underwood was attempting to manipulate and control [CW] . 
 10 Underwood also challenged the sufficiency of evidence to support 
the convictions, but th e issue is not raised to this court and thus is not  
addressed. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
10 considers the following factors (1) the nature of the conduct; 
(2) the promptness of the curative instruction; and (3) the 
strength or weakness of the evidence against the defendant.
   
  As to the nature of the conduct, Underwood asserted 
that the prosecutor’s  remark impermissibly attacked defense 
counsel’s integrity and operated to denigrate the legal 
profession as a whole.  Underwood contended  that the prosecutor 
committed misconduct by accusing his counsel of “being 
dishonest, unethical and trying to induce [CW] to mislead the 
jury and commit perjury.”  
 
 With regard to the promptness or lack of a curative 
instruction, Underwood submitted that his counsel promptly 
objected to the improper statement.  However, the circuit court 
overruled the objection, Underwood explained, and thereby gave 
the impression that the attack by the prosecutor was proper. 
  
Finally, Underwood argued  that the factor considering 
the strength or weakness of the evidence weighed in favor of 
prosecutorial misconduct.  The evidence presented by the State 
was based predominantly on  CW’s testimony and credibility, which 
Underwood contended was inconsistent.   Because the case against 
Underwood hinged on the credibility of CW, Underwood argued, the 
State’s case was not strong enough to 
outweigh the inflammatory 
effect of the 
deputy prosecutor’s  comments.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
11   Underwood therefore concluded that, under the three 
factors, the prosecutor’s comments clearly constituted 
prosecutorial misconduct in violation of Underwood’s right to a 
fair and impartial jury .  Further, Underwood asserted, the 
nature of the prosecutorial misconduct was sufficiently 
egregious to bar retrial under the double jeopardy clause of the 
Hawaiʻi Constitut
ion.  (Citing State v. Rogan , 91 Hawaii 405, 
423, 984 P.2d 1231, 1249  (1999).)   
  In its answering brief, the State argued that the 
prosecutor’s remark s were not improper.  The State contended 
that Underwood’s counsel had realized that CW was minimizing, 
citing CW’s admission that she wanted the “best thing” for 
Underwood and CW’s repeated lack of detailed recollection of the 
incident while testifying
..  Defense counsel proceeded to ask a 
series of leading questions to take advantage of the CW’s 
minimization, the State argued, pressuring her to agree that she 
had attempted to kick Underwood .  The prosecutor’s s tatements  
were therefore an accurate description of defense counsel’s 
cross-examination, the State contended , and their “primary 
thrust” was simply to stress to the jury that CW stuck to her 
story.11  Because the State reasoned that the prosecutor’s 
                     
 11 Although the State quoted both statements and argued  generally 
that neither were misconduct, the State only specifically discusse d the 
statement “the defense attorney tried to push [CW] on cross- examination; 
tried to get her to say or admit that she tried to kick the defendant .” ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
12 comments were not improper, it did not address whether the 
statements were prejudicial before concluding that the circuit 
court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant 
Underwood a new trial. 
 
 On October 10, 2017, the ICA issued a summary 
disposition order (SDO).  The ICA found that it was not improper 
for the prosecutor  to assert in closing argument that defense 
counsel had tried to push CW on cross- examination to say or 
admit that she tried to kick the defendant.   The ICA considered 
the statements in light of CW’s testimony that she had numerous 
contacts with Underwood since the incident, had spoken with 
Underwood about testifying, and had expressed that she still 
loved Underwood and wanted what was best for him.  Given this 
context and the substance of defense counsel’s cross-
examination, the ICA concluded that the prosecutor ’s statement  
was a fair characterization of what had occurred. 
 
 The ICA expressed some concern over the prosecutor’s  
comment that defense counsel “tried to get CW  to make up some 
story about how she tried to kick the defendant and she fell 
back.”  That remark, the ICA reasoned , could be interpreted as 
an attack on the integrity of defense counsel and in that regard 
could not be condoned.  But the comment was “brief and somewhat 
indirect,” the ICA stated.   Therefore, the ICA hel d, it was 
distinguishable “at least in degree” from similar disparaging ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
13 comments this court found improper in State v. Klinge. (C iting 
92 Hawaiʻ i 577, 593, 994 P.2d 509, 525 (2000).)    
  Further, the ICA stated , although the court overruled 
Underwood’s counsel’s objection, the court had instructed the 
jury that “[s]tatements or remarks made by counsel are not 
evidence.  You should consider their arguments to you, but you 
are not bound by their recollections or interpretations of the 
evidence.”  The ICA concluded that, given that “ the arguably 
offending comment was a one-time brief remark ” and the circuit 
court delivered the above instruction to the jury, and 
considering the strength of the evidence against Underwood, 
there was no reasonable possibility that the prosecutor’s  
comment contributed to Underwood’s convictions .  Accordingly, 
the ICA affirmed the Judgment.   
IV. STANDARD  OF REVIEW  
  “Allegations of prosecutorial misconduct are reviewed 
under the harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard, which 
requires an examination of the record and a determination of 
whether there is a reasonable possibility that the error 
complained of might have contributed to the conviction.”  State 
v. Rogan , 91 Hawaiʻi 405, 412, 984 P.2d 1231,  1238 (1999) 
(quoting State v. Balisbisana, 83 Hawai ʻi 109, 114, 924 P.2d 
1215, 1220 (1996)) (internal quotation marks and citations 
omitted)). ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
14 V. DISCUSSION 
  Underwood contends that the prosecutor’s  comments 
during closing argument suggesting that defense counsel 
attempted to induce CW  to fabricate her testimony constituted 
prosecutorial misconduct.  The misconduct warrants vacating his 
convictions and barring retrial under principles of double 
jeopardy, Underwood asserts. 
  In evaluating whether alleged prosecutorial misconduct 
amounts to harmful error, this court considers “(1) the nature 
of the conduct; (2) the promptness of a curative instruction; 
and (3) the strength or weakness of the evidence against the 
defendant.”  
State v. Rogan , 91 Hawai i 405, 412, 984 P.2d 1231, 
1238 (1999).  Although this framework was formulated in the 
context of a defendant’s motion for mistrial, we have since 
extended it to review all allegations of prosecutorial 
misconduct.12  See, e.g. , State v. Schnabel , 127 Hawai i 432, 452, 
279 P.3d 1237, 1257 (2012).  Misconduct requires vacating a 
conviction when, in light of these factors, “there is a 
reasonable possibility that the error complained of might have 
contributed to the conviction.”  Rogan, 91 Hawai i at 412, 984 
                     
 12 “The term ‘prosecutorial misconduct’ is a legal term of art that 
refers to any improper action committed by a prosecutor, however harmless or 
unintentional.”  State v. Maluia , 107 Hawai i 20, 25, 108 P.3d 974, 979 
(2005). ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
15 P.2d at 1238 (quoting State v. Balisbisana , 83 Hawai i 109, 114, 
924 P.2d 1215, 1220 (1996)). 
A. The Nature of the Conduct 
  Under the first factor, this court considers the 
nature of the challenged conduct in relation to our criminal 
justice system generally and the special role of the prosecutor 
specifically.13  See Rogan, 91 Hawai i at 412-15, 984 P.2d at 
1238-41.  Underwood specifically challenges two statements made 
by the prosecution during closing argument.  He argues that, in 
telling the jury that,  “The defense attorney tried to get [CW ] 
to make up some story about how she tried to kick the defendant 
and she fell back,” the prosecutor  attacked defense couns el’s 
integrity by intimating the lawyer had solicited CW  to perjure 
herself.  The prosecutor then reinforced this perception, 
Underwood contends, by reiterating that “the defense attorney 
tried to push [CW] on cross-examination; tried to get her to say 
or admit that she tried to kick the defendant.”   As we vacate 
Underwood’s conviction s based on the prosecutor’s first 
statement, we do not discuss the second comment. 
                     
 13 There is some discrepancy in our precedents as to whether this 
first factor amounts to a determination of whether prosecutorial misconduct 
took place, see, e.g. , Rogan, 91 Hawai i at 412, 984 P.2d at 1238; State v. 
Pacheco, 96 Hawai i 83, 95, 26 P.3d 572, 584 (2001), or is a separate 
assessment of the severity of the wrongdoing following the initial 
identification of misconduct, see, e.g., State v. Tuua , 125 Hawai i 10, 16, 
250 P.3d 273, 279 (2011).  Because the two evaluations consistently overlap, 
we address these issues together.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
16   T he ICA minimized the effect of the first statement by 
characterizing it as a “one -time brief remark.”  However, the  
prosecutor’s statement cannot be viewed in isolation.  The 
prosecutor’s closing argument repeatedly emphasized that 
Underwood had exerted “control” over CW.  The prosecutor noted 
that Underwood and CW  had “talked about this case”  and claimed 
that “[w]hat [CW] did on the stand was a product of those 
conversations.”  The prosecutor  went as far as to claim that 
CW’s “testimony here in court, all of that was a product of the 
defendant’s control” and stated that the jury could “[e]nd  his 
manipulation” by “[f]ind[ing] him guilty.”14   
  
In light of the prosecutor’s suggestion that Underwood 
had acted to wrongfully influence CW’s testimony , the remark 
that defense counsel “tried to get [ CW] to make up some story”  
necessarily implicated U nderwood in his counsel’s asserted 
misconduct.  The clear insinuation of the prosecutor’s assertion  
was that Underwood and his defense counsel had together sought 
to induce CW to commit perjury--a fact for which there was no 
evidence in the record.  This likely had the effect of 
                     
 14 During the post -conviction hearing on Underwood’s motion for a 
new trial, defense counsel argued that  this last statement amounted to an 
exhortation to the jury to decide the case on irrelevant and unsubstantiated 
grounds.  In closing argument, “[t]he prosecutor should make only those 
arguments that are consistent with the trier’s duty to decide the case on the 
evidence, and should not seek to divert the trier from that duty.”  ABA 
Standards for Criminal Justice: Prosecution Function , Standard 3 -6.8(c) (4th 
ed. 2015).   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
17 encouraging the jury not only to discredit CW ’s testimony, but 
also to doubt defense counsel and Underwood ’s personal 
character. 
  T he ICA acknowledged that the prosecutor ’s remark 
could be interpreted as such an “attack on the integrity of 
defense counsel and in that regard cannot be condoned.”  The ICA 
ultimately dismissed the statement, however, as only an 
“arguably offending comment .”   
  This understates the gravity of the insinuation.  Like 
all advocates, a prosecutor is permitted during closing argument 
“to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence[,] and wide 
latitude is allowed in discussing the evidence.”  Rogan, 91 
Hawaii at 412, 984 P.2d at 1238 (quoting State v. Quitog , 85 
Hawaii 128, 145, 938 P.2d 559, 576 (1997)).  Inferences are not 
reasonable, however, when the evidence does not “bear[] a 
logical and proximate connection to the point the prosecutor 
wishes to prove.”  State v. Basham , 132 Hawai i 97, 112, 319 P.3d 
1105, 1120 (2014) (quoting U.S. v. Waldemer , 50 F.3d 1379, 1384 
(7th Cir. 1995)).  A prosecutor exceeds the acceptable scope of 
closing argument when a statement “cannot be justified as a fair 
comment on the evidence but instead is more akin to the 
presentation of wholly new evidence to the jury, which should 
only be admitted subject to cross -examination, to proper ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
18 instructions and to the rules of evidence.”  Id. (quoting United 
States v. Klebig , 600 F.3d 700, 718 (7th Cir. 2009)) (emphasis 
omitted).  And prosecutors, like all attorneys appearing before 
a tribunal, are “bound to refrain from expressing their personal 
views as to a defendant’s guilt or credibility of witnesses.”  
State v. Marsh, 68 Haw. 659, 660, 728 P.2d 1301, 1302 (1986) 
(citing United States v. Young , 470 U.S. 1 (1985); American Bar 
Association (ABA) Prosecution Function Standard , Standard 3- 5.8 
(1980)). 
  As stated, there was no evidence in the record to 
support an inference that defense counsel had threatened, 
manipulated, or otherwise pressured CW  to perjure herself.  The 
prosecutor’s suggestion that CW had changed aspects of her story 
as a result of defense counsel’s wrongful influence  was 
impermissible speculation-- or at least an impermissible personal 
opinion as to CW’s credibility.  Such an inference was therefore 
unreasonable under our precedents and beyond the proper scope of 
closing argument for an  advocate.  
  “A prosecutor,” moreover , “has the responsibility of a 
minister of justice and not simply that of an advocate.”  
Quitog, 85 Hawai i at 136 n.19, 938 P.2d at  567 n.19 (quoting 
Cmt. 1, Hawai i Rules of Professional Conduct (HRPC) Rule 3.8).  
A jury is likely to “give special weight to the prosecutor’ s 
arguments, not only because of the prestige associated with the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
19 prosecutor’s office, but also because of the fact-finding 
facilities presumably a vailable to the office.”  State v. 
Klinge, 92 Hawai i 577, 592, 994 P.2d 509, 524 (2000) (quoting 
ABA Prosecution Function Standard  3–5.8 (1993)).  Thus, special 
concerns arise when a prosecutor wrongly impugns the personal 
integrity of opposing counsel. 
  First, “[a] prosecuting attorney’s improper 
suggestions, insinuations, and especially, assertions of 
personal knowledge are apt to carry much weight against the 
accused when they should properly carry none.”  Marsh, 68 Haw. 
at 661, 728 P.2d at 1302 (quoting Berger v. United States , 295 
U.S. 78, 88 (1935)).  This is to say that a jury is apt to 
attach undue weight to a prosecutor’s disparagement of defense 
counsel, undermining the defendant’s right to a fair trial.  A 
prosecutor’s duties include “specific o bligations to see that 
the defendant is accorded procedural justice and that guilt is 
decided upon the basis of sufficient evidence” --and not upon the 
basis of the prosecutor’s ne gative personal assessment of 
defense counsel.  Quitog, 85 Hawai i at 136 n.19, 938 P.2d 559, 
567 n.19 (1997) (quoting Cmt. 1, HRPC Rule 3.8).  A prosecutor’s 
attack on defense counsel’s integrity implicates the defendant’s 
right to a fair trial because it is a  “strik[e] at the appellant 
over the shoulders of his counsel in an attempt to prejudice the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
20 jury against the appellant.”  Bell v. State , 614 S.W.2d 122, 123 
(Tex. Crim. App. 1981).  
  Second, a prosecutor’s attack on the personal 
character of defense counsel “operate[s] to denigrate the legal 
profession in general.”  State v. Klinge , 92 Hawai i 577, 595, 
994 P.2d 509, 527 (2000).  Such comments not only “lack[] the 
professionalism and decorum required of attorneys who practice 
before the bar of the courts of Hawai i,” State v. Ganal , 81 
Hawaii 358, 377, 917 P.2d 370, 389 (1996), but they also 
“undermine the objective detachment that should separate a 
lawyer from the cause being argued.”  Basham, 132 Hawai i at 115, 
319 P.3d at 1123 (quoting Marsh, 68 Haw. at 660, 728 P.2d at 
1302).  “Vigorous and zealous advocacy is a necessary component 
of our judicial system,” Young v. Allstate Ins. Co. , 119 Hawai i 
403, 419, 198 P.3d 666, 682 (2008) (brackets omitted), and a 
defendant in a criminal case is entitled under the Hawai i and 
U.S. Constitutions to a lawyer who will fervently defend his or 
her interests in court.  State v. Tetu , 139 Hawai i 207, 215, 386 
P.3d 844, 852 (2016).  Insinuations that a criminal attorney’s 
zealous defense of a client amount s to unethical behavior strike 
at the foundation of our adversarial system and “should not be 
tolerated by either the trial judge or the bar. ”  U.S. v. Linn , 
31 F.3d 987, 993 (10th Cir. 1994).  Such comments thus weigh ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
21 heavily in favor of a finding of misconduct that warrants 
vacating Underwood’s conviction s.  
B. The Promptness or Lack of a Curative Instruction 
  Under the second factor, a reviewing court considers 
the extent to which a trial court’s instruction to the jury 
minimized or eliminated the prejudicial effect of misconduct.  
Rogan, 91 Hawai i at 415, 984 P.2d at 1241.  When a court 
promptly addresses the impropriety, “a prosecutor’ s improper 
remarks are [generally] considered cured by the court ’s 
instructions to the jury, because it is presumed that the jury 
abided by the court ’s admoni tion to disregard the statement.”  
Id. (quoting State v. McGriff , 76 Hawai i 148, 160, 871 P.2d 782, 
794 (1994)) (alteration in original).   
  Here, the ICA placed great weight on the fact that the 
circuit court had previously instructed the jury that 
“[s]tatements or remarks made by counsel are not evidence.  You 
should consider their arguments to you, but you are not bound by 
their recollections or interpretations of the evidence.”  The 
instruction was an ineffective remedy to the improper remarks 
for three reasons. 
  First, the instruction did not address the problematic 
nature of the prosecutor’s statements.  While this court has 
reasoned that “expressions of personal opinion by the prosecutor 
are a form of unsworn, unchecked testimony,” Basham, 132 Hawa
ii ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
22 at 115, 319 P.3d at 1123 (quoting Marsh, 68 Haw. at 660, 728 
P.2d at 1302), the danger in this case is not solely that the 
jury could wrongly consider the prosecutor’s statements as 
evidence in its own right.  Cf. Klinge , 92 Hawai i at 592, 994 at 
524 (noting that a jury is likely to presume a prosecutor has 
access to special “fact -finding facilities”).  The jury may also 
have believed that the prosecution’s remarks were acceptable 
inferences from the evidence instead of unsupported speculation.  
Indeed, the court’s instruction specifically directed the jury 
to “consider [counsel’s] arguments to you,” and characterized 
what would follow as counsel’s “recollections or interpretations 
of the evidence.”  The prosecutor’s improper statements should 
not have been considered by the jury whatsoever because they 
were not a valid or reasonable interpretation of the evidence 
admitted at trial.  Additionally, the assertion by the 
prosecutor of improper collusion outside of the trial proceeding 
was not a subject matter of the general instruction. 
  Second, the instruction was general in nature and was 
delivered to the jury along with a large number of other 
standard instructions before closing arguments began.  “[I]t is 
unlikely that the circuit court ’s general instructions that were 
delivered well [before] the inflammatory comments along with the 
other general jury instructions could have negated the 
prejudicial effect” of the specific statements  by the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
23 prosecutor.  Rogan , 91 Hawai i at 415, 984 P.2d at 1241; see also 
Basham, 132 Hawai i at 111, 319 P.3d at 1119 ( “Additionally, 
while the court properly instructed the jury on accomplice 
liability, that instruction did not cure the prosecutor ’s 
misstatements of the law, where no specific curative instruction 
relating to the misstatements was given. ”); State v. Espiritu , 
117 Hawai i 127, 143, 176 P.3d 885, 901 (2008) (“While the court 
here did properly instruct the jury . . . that instruction could 
not cure Respondent ’s misstatements of the law, where no 
specific curative instruction relating to the misstatements was 
given.”).  
  Third, “not only was there no curative instruction 
given to address the inflammatory comments, but the circuit 
court overruled defense counsel’s timely objection.”  Rogan, 91 
Hawaii at 415, 984 P.2d at 1241.  “By overruling defense 
counsel’s objection, the court, at least tacitly, placed its 
imprimatur upon the [prosecutor] ’s improper remarks.”  Schnabel, 
127 Hawai i at 453, 279 P.3d at  1258 (quoting Pacheco, 96 Hawai i 
at 96, 26 P.3d at 585) (brackets and footnotes omitted).  This 
is to say that the circuit court’s overruling of defense 
counsel’s objection likely appeared to the jury as though the 
court had endorsed the prosecution’s statements as proper 
argument.  Basham, 132 Hawai ʻi at 110, 319 P.3d at 1118 (holding ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
24 that, because the trial court overruled defense counsel ’s 
objection to a misstatement of law, it accredited the 
definitions given by the prosecutor). 
  Thus, the circuit court’s prior instruction was 
unlikely to cure the prejudice created by the prosecut or’s 
improper remarks, and no other curative measure was taken.  This 
factor therefore weighs strongly in favor of vacating 
Underwood’s conviction s. 
C. The Weight of Evidence Against Underwood 
  In considering the final factor, reviewing courts 
weigh the evidence supporting the defendant’s conviction.  See
 
Rogan, 91 Hawai i at 415–16, 984 P.2d at 1241 –42.  When evidence 
is “so overwhelming as to outweigh the inflammatory effect of 
the” improper comments, reviewing courts will regard the 
impropriety as ultimately harmless.  Id. at 415, 984 P2.d at 
1241.  When it cannot be said beyond a reasonable doubt that the 
same result would have been reached absent the improper conduct, 
however, the defendant’s conviction must be vacated.  See id.; 
Pacheco, 96 Hawai i at 97, 26 P.3d at 586.  
  The ICA concluded that there was no reasonable  
possibility that the prosecutor’s comments might have 
contributed to Underwood’s  convictions.  In concluding the 
misconduct was harmless,  the ICA stated that the strength of the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
25 evidence in this case sufficiently outweighed the effect of the 
prosecutor’s remark, but it did not provide further explanation.  
 
 Here, Underwood was convicted of unlawful imprisonment 
in the second degree and abuse of family or household members.  
Although testimony from other witnesses and physical evidence 
indicated the surrounding circumstances were 
generally 
consistent with CW’s  account of events, only the statements of 
CW herself directly described the actual acts constituting the 
two offenses.  Thus, Underwood’s conviction s were ultimately 
dependent on the jury ’s assessment of CW’s credibility.15 
  W hen a conviction is largely dependent on a jury’s 
determination as to the credibility of a complainant’s 
testimony, we have held that the evidence of the offense is not 
so “overwhelming” that it renders the prosecutor’s impr oper 
statements harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  Rogan, 91 Hawai i 
at 415, 984 P.2d at 1241.  The potential for prejudice is 
particularly evident where, as here, the improper comments 
specifically concerned the credibility of the testimony on which 
                     
 15 In his application, Underwood argues that there is a significant 
basis to conclude the jury discredited CW’s statements.  CW was potentially 
biased and had a motive to be untruthful, Underwood argues , because on the 
night of the incident, CW was hurt and angry because she believed that 
Underwood had been carrying on relationships with two  other women.  CW’s 
inconsistent statements and memory regarding the incident clearly led the 
jury to doubt some aspects of her testimony, Underwood reasons, as evidenced 
by Underwood’s acquittal on the firearm charge and conviction for only a 
lesser included offense of the kidnapping charge.  Under all of these 
circumstances, Underwood maintains, it can hardly be said that the State had 
an overwhelmingly strong case against him.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
26 the case turned.  See Pacheco, 96 Hawai i at 97, 26 P.3d at 586.  
Thus, the third factor also weighs in favor of vacating 
Underwood’s conviction s. 
  T he nature of the prosecution’s remarks during closing 
argument, the lack of any effective curative instruction by the 
court, and the relative weight of the evidence, considered 
collectively, make clear that “there is a reasonable possibility 
that the error complained of might have contributed to ” 
Underwood’s conviction s.  Rogan, 91 Hawai i at 412, 984 P.2d at 
1238 (1999). 
D. Double Jeopardy 
  This court has held that, in limited “exceptional 
circumstances,” prosecutorial misconduct may be “so egregious” 
that the double jeopardy protections of article I, section 10 of 
the Hawai i Constitution may bar retrial.  Rogan, 91 Hawai i at 
423 & n.11, 984 P.2d at 1249 & n.11.  Reviewing courts do not 
consider the subjective intent of the prosecutor in determining 
whether retrial is prohibited.  Id. at 423, 984 P.2d at 124.  
Rather, the relevant inquiry is whether, “fro m an objective 
standpoint,” the misconduct was so egregious that it “ clearly 
denied a defendant his or her right to a fair trial.”  Id. 
  Our decisions do not provide bright line rules for 
determining when misconduct is sufficiently egregious to bar ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
27 retrial, but we have emphasized that it is “a much higher 
standard than that used to determine whether a defendant is 
entitled to a new trial. ”  Id. at 423 n.11, 984 P.2d at 124 
n.11.  By way of example, we have held that retrial was barred 
by double jeopardy principles when a prosecutor made an overt 
appeal to racial prejudice in closing argument.  Id.  In 
contrast, a prosecutor’s “flagrant defiance of [a] circuit 
court
’s in limine ruling and personal and vulgar denigration” of 
a defendant was held not to be so egregious as to implicate 
double jeopardy principles.  Pacheco, 96 Hawai i 83, 98, 26 P.3d 
572, 587 (2001).  Other examples of impropriety that have fallen 
short of the double jeopardy standard include a prosecutor’s 
commentary on the consequences of a j ury’s verdict in other 
legal proceedings, Tuua, 125 Hawai i at 14, 250 P.3d at 277, a 
prosecutor’s argument that the jury should disregard the court’s 
instructions and decide the case based on “gut feeling,” 
Schnabel, 127 Hawai i at 452, 279 P.3d at 1257, and a 
prosecutor’s misstatement of the law governing a potential 
defense, Espiritu, 117 Hawai i at 144, 176 P.3d at 902. 
  In light of these precedents, the improper remarks in 
this case were not so egregious as to clearly deny Underwood a 
fair trial, and the protections of double jeopardy are therefore 
not implicated. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
28 VI. CONCLUSION 
  Accordingly, we vacate the ICA’s November 1, 2017 
Judgment on Appeal and the circuit court Judgment,  and we remand 
the case to the circuit court for further proceedings.
