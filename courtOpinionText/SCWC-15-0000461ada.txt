2 (ICA) rejected Fukuoka’s contenti on that the district court 
abused its discretion in not dismissing the case with prejudice.  
Fukuoka on certiorari to this court reasserts that the charges 
were not serious as a matter of law and that the State of Hawai i 
should have been precluded from reinstituting prosecution.  In 
our review of the ICA’ s decision , we consider the principles 
that guide a trial court in exercising its discretion to dismiss 
a case with or without prejudice for a violation of HRPP Rule 
48.  We conclude that the ICA did not err and affirm its 
Judgment on Appeal. 
I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND 
  On September 28, 2014, George Fukuoka was arrested for 
operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant 
(OVUII).  He posted bail and was ordered to appear at the 
District Court of the Second Circuit, Molokaʻ i Division,  
(district court)  on October 28, 2014.   
  On October 22, 2014, the State of Hawai ʻi filed a five-
count complaint.  The counts were as follows: 1) OVUII, in 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 291E-61(a)(1) 
and/or 291E- 61(a)(3) and 291E- 61(b) (Supp. 201 2); 2) inattention 
to driving, in violation of HRS § 291-12 (Supp. 20 12); 3) 
reckless driving, in violation of HRS § 291 -2 (2007); 4) duty 
upon striking an unattended vehicle or other property, in ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
3 violation of HRS § 291C-15 (Supp. 2012); and 5) lack of due 
care, in violation of Maui County Code (MCC) § 10.52.010 (1965).1   
  Fukuoka appeared at district court on October 28, 2014 
for arraignment and entered pleas of not guilty to all of the 
charges.2  The district court set a pretrial conference for 
November 25, 2014.  At the pretrial conference, Fukuoka 
requested that he be permitted to issue subpoenas duces tecum 
for the personnel and internal affairs files of Maui Police 
Department (MPD) officers involved in the underlying incident.  
                       
 1 Counts 1 through 3 are classified by the Hawaii Revised Statutes 
as petty misdemeanors.  See HRS § 701-107(4) (Supp. 2013) (an offense is a 
petty misdemeanor if it is so designated or if it provides that persons 
convicted thereof may be sentenced to a term of imprisonment not to exceed 30 
days); HRS § 291E-61(b)(1) (providing maximum possible ter m of 5 days’ 
imprisonment for a first offense OVUII); HRS §  291-12 (providing maximum 
possible term of 30 days’ imprisonment for inattention to driving); HRS 
§ 291-2 (providing maximum possible term of 30 days’ imprisonment for 
reckless driving).   
  Count 4 is classified by the Hawaii Revised Statutes as a 
violation punishable by fines.  See HRS § 291C-161 (2007 & Supp. 2012) 
(identifying as a violation “violat[ing] any of the provisions” of HRS 
chapter 291C and imposing a fine not to exceed $200 for a first offense); HRS 
§ 291C-15 (providing trauma system special fund surcharge of up to $100 for 
violating duty upon striking an unattended vehicle or other property in 
addition to other penalties imposed by HRS chapter 291C).  
  Count 5 constitutes a violation  punishable by a fine of not more 
than $100 for a first offense and not more than $250 for every subsequent 
offense.  See MCC § 10.72.020 (1983) (defining penalty for violation) (last 
amended 1983); MCC § 10.08.050 (1980) (identifying as a violation “do[in g] 
any act forbidden or fail[ing] to perform any act required” by title 10 of 
the Maui County Code) (last amended 1980).  
 2 The Honorable Adrianne N. Heely presided over the preliminary and 
discovery proceedings in this case.  The Honorable Kirstin M. Hamman presided 
over the motion to dismiss the complaint with prejudice and the motion to 
reconsider the court’s dismissal without prejudice.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
4 The court issued an order on December 12, 2014,  permitting 
Fukuoka to issue the subpoenas, and  the returns of service on 
two subpoenas were filed three days later.   
  On December 18, 2014, the County of Maui (County), on 
behalf of MPD, moved to quash the subpoenas (Motion to Quash).  
The hearing date  of December 23, 2014 was continued to January 
27, 2015;  in the meantime, MPD filed documents under seal for in 
camera review.  At the scheduled hearing, the district court 
continued the matter initially to February 10, 2015  and then 
later to February 20, 2015.   
  At a status conference on February 20, 2015, Fukuoka 
and the County agreed to a protective order regarding the files 
to be produced pursuant to the subpoenas.  Later that day, the 
district court filed an order granting in part and denying in 
part the Motion to Quash.  The court also set a March 24, 2015 
trial date.   
  On February 24, 2015, Fukuoka filed a p roposed s ua 
sponte order resetting the trial date, which indicated that the 
new trial date was necessary due to a previously scheduled 
trial.  Three days later, the district court entered the order, 
rescheduling the trial from March 24, 2015 to April 14, 2015.   
  On the date of trial, Fukuoka filed with the district 
court a motion to dismiss the complaint with prejudice (Motion ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
5 to Dismiss) on the ground that his rights under HRPP Rule 48 had 
been violated.3  Fukuoka contended that the case should be 
dismissed because 198 days had elapsed between his September 28, 
2014 arrest and the April 14, 2015 trial date and that no HRPP 
Rule 48 exclusions applied to that period.  Fukuoka also argued, 
pursuant to the three- factor test set forth by this court in 
State v. Estencion , 63 Haw. 264, 625 P.2d 1040 (1981), that the 
case should be dismissed with prejudice.  Fukuoka submitted that 
the first Estencion  factor, the seriousness of the offense, 
weighed heavily in his favor because all of the charges against 
him were petty misdemeanors, which are not “serious offenses”  in
comparison to full misdemeanors.  Fukuoka maintained that his 
position was supported by the fact that the constitutional right
to a jury trial did not attach to a first OVUII offense because 
it is a petty offense and not constitutionally serious.    
 
  A s to the remaining factors, Fukuoka submitted that 
the second factor, the facts and circumstances of the case that 
led to the dismissal, also weighed in his favor because the 
delay before trial was the fault of the district court for not 
timely resolving the issues related to the subpoenas duces 
                       
 3 Fukuoka also argued that the case should be dismissed because of 
a violation of his constitutional speedy trial right.  This issue is not 
raised in Fukuoka’s application for  a writ of certiorari, and therefore it is 
not addressed. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
6 tecum.  The third factor, impact of reprosecution on the 
administration of HRPP Rule 48 and on the administration of 
justice, also weighed in his favor, Fukuoka argued, because a 
reprosecution would frustrate the fair administration of HRPP 
Rule 48 and of justice.   
  The State argued in response that there was no HRPP 
Rule 48 violation because much of the elapsed time period should 
be charged to Fukuoka as he requested pretrial continuances, he  
had never requested that the district court set a trial date, 
and the State had never requested a continuance.  The State 
reserved argument on whether the dismissal should be with or 
without prejudice until the district court ruled on whether 
there was a violation of HRPP Rule 48.  Later that day, the 
court issued an order dismissing the case without prejudice 
(Order Dismissing Without Prejudice).   
  Fukuoka filed a motion to reconsider the court’s 
dismissal without prejudice (Motion to Reconsider).  He argued 
that petty misdemeanors are not serious offenses as a matter of 
law.  Fukuoka also contended that the facts and circumstances 
leading to dismissal should be viewed in his favor because many 
of the delays were due to the County’s Motion to Quash.   
  In response, the State  maintained that the delay was 
at least partly attributable to the defense.  The State ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
7 submitted that the impact of reprosecution on the administration 
of justice weighed in its favor because of the short length of 
the delay and because the reasons for the delay were proper.  As 
for the seriousness of the offense, the State alluded to various 
circumstances of the incident, which the defense challenged.4    
  The district court denied the Motion to Reconsider.  
In its oral ruling, the court stated that it was no t taking into 
consideration circumstances regarding the incident that had  been 
stated by the prosecution at the hearing.  The district court 
also stated that “given the short delay[, it did] not find that 
there would be a significant impact of reprosecution under 
[HRPP] Rule 48.”  An Order Denying Motion to Reconsider was 
entered at the c onclusion of the hearing.    
  Thereafter, the district court issued findings of 
fact, conclusions of law,  and an order granting in part and 
denying in part the Motion to Dismiss (Findings of Fact and 
Conclusions of Law).  The court found that Fukuoka’s case had 
been pending disposition for 198 days and that trial would have 
commenced within the 180- day deadli ne but for the court’s sua 
                       
 4 The State contended that “this was a serious accident” involving 
“blood at the scene” and that a windshield that “was thrown quite far.”   The 
State also suggested that Fukuoka fled the scene of the accident.  In 
rebuttal, Fukuoka argued that these assertions were hearsay and that the 
State did not have a declaration of an officer to support the assertions.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
8 sponte order continuing the trial date.  Citing HRPP Rule 48(c), 
the district court stated that a delay due to court congestion,  
absent exceptional circumstances,  is not an excludable time 
period.  The court noted that the order resetting the trial date 
did not indicate any exceptional circumstances for the resetting 
of trial.  Thus, finding no applicable excludable time periods 
under HRPP Rule 48(c), the district court concluded that HRPP 
Rule 48 had been violated because trial had not commenced with 
180 days of Fukuoka’s arrest and the setting of bail.   
  The district court then addressed whether dismissal of 
the case would be with or without prejudice.  The court stated 
that it had considered the three Estencion factors.   First, a s 
to the seriousness of the offenses, the court reasoned that the 
charges were serious in nature, the offense of intoxicated 
driving can result in significant harms, the other charges were 
tied to the OVUII offense, and the court would not extend the 
constitutional jury trial right analysis to its determination 
under HRPP Rule 48.   
  With respect to the facts and circumstances of the 
case that led to the dismissal, the district court found that it 
was well within the right of the County to file a Motion to 
Quash the subpoenas duc es tecum.  The court noted that the 
prosecution did not request any continuances nor have control ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
9 over the resolution of the issues relating to the Motion to 
Quash.  Additionally, the district court determined that, but 
for the court’s sua sponte order continuing the trial to April 
14, 2015, the trial would have commenced within the time period 
required by HRPP Rule 48.  As to this factor, the court found 
that it weighed in favor of dismissal without prejudice.   
  Lastly, as to the impact of reprosecution, the 
district court noted that there had been no showing of prejudice 
to Fukuoka and that reprosecution furthers the public’ s interest 
in bringing defendants charged with crimes to trial.  The court 
found that the 18-day delay was not substantial.  The court 
concluded that the seriousness of the offenses and the facts and 
circumstances that led to the dismissal outweighed any impact of 
reprosecution on the administration of HRPP Rule 48 and on the 
administration of justice.   Accordingly, the district court 
determined that the dismissal should be without prejudice.   
  Fukuoka appealed to the ICA from both the Order 
Dismissing Without Prejudice and the O rder Denying Motion to 
Reconsider.   Fukuoka principally focused his argument  on the 
contention that petty misdemeanors should be non- serious as a 
matter of law under the first Estencion  factor.  The State 
responded that there was no abuse of discretion because the 
district court had properly applied the holding of  Estencion, ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
10 and it disputed  Fukuoka’s argument that petty misdemeanors 
should be categorically non- serious.  In reply, Fukuoka 
contended that seriousness in the context of HRPP Rule 48 is 
linked to the constitutional jury trial right.  Fukuoka also 
argued that the district court’s conclusion that the prosecution 
had no control over the process of resolving the subpoe nas and 
the Motion to Quash improperly relieved the prosecution from its 
shared responsibility of carrying out HRPP Rule 48 requirements.   
  In a S ummary Disposition Order (SDO) affirming the 
Order Dismissing Without Prejudice,5 the ICA stated that it had 
already rejected a mechanical per se rule for t he “seriousness 
of the offense” factor, citing State v. Kim , 109 Hawai i 59, 66, 
122 P.3d 1157, 1164 (App. 2005).  Rather, the ICA concluded that 
“the maximum possible punishment is merely one measure of the 
gravity of the offense” and that t he trial court may consider 
the combination of the charges brought against the defendant.  
The ICA noted that the district court had determined that 
“although the charges were petty misdemeanors,  . . . the 
offenses were inextricably tied to the OVUII charge,  and that 
OVUII was a serious offense because it could result in 
                       
 5 The ICA’s SDO can be found a t State v. Fukuoka, No. CAAP -15-
0000461, 2016 WL 5107025, 2016 Haw. App. LEXIS 405 (Sept. 20, 2016) (SDO).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
11 significant harm to life and property. ”  The ICA also concluded  
that the seriousness of an offense with respect to HRPP Rule 48 
is not related to whether the offense is constitutionally petty 
and thus “ does not determine whether an offense is serious under 
Estencion .”  Therefore, the ICA held that the district court did 
not abuse its discretion in finding that the offenses were 
serious for purposes of HRPP Rule 48 and that the court did not 
6err in dismissing without prejudice  the charges against Fukuoka.    
  In his application for a writ of certiorari, Fukuoka 
asserts that petty misdemeanors are categorically non-serious 
offenses under Estencion , that the district court erred in its 
determination that the facts and circumstances weighed in favor 
of dismissal without prejudice, and that the court erred in 
concluding that these two Estencion  factors outweighed any 
impact of the third factor.  Accordingly, Fukuoka contends that 
the district court abused its discretion in dismissing his case 
without prejudice.   
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW 
  We review a trial court’s decision to dismiss a case 
with or without prejudice for violation of HRPP Rule 48 for 
                       
 6 The ICA also concluded that Fukuoka had waived any challenge to 
the Order Denying Motion to Reconsider and determined that his remaining 
arguments were without merit.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
12 abuse of discretion.  See  State v. Estencion , 63 Haw. 264, 269, 
625 P.2d 1040, 1044 (1981).  An abuse of discretion occurs when 
“the decisionmaker ‘ exceeds the bounds of reason or disregards 
rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial 
detriment of a party. ’”  State v. Kony , 138 Hawai i 1, 8, 375 
P.3d 1239, 1246 (2016) (quoting  State v. Vliet , 95 Hawai i 94, 
108, 19 P.3d 42, 56 (2001)).  
III.   DISCUSSION 
 
 HRPP Rule 48 and Estencion  A.
 
  HRPP Rule 48 is intended to “ensure an accused a 
speedy trial, which is separate and distinct from [ the] 
constitutional protection to a speedy trial. ”  State v. 
Estencion , 63 Haw. 264, 268, 625 P.2d 1040, 1043 (1981).  
Subsection ( b) of HRPP Rule 48 provides in relevant part as 
follows: 
 (b) By court.  Except in the case of traffic offenses 
that are not punishable by imprisonment, the court shall, 
on motion of the defendant, dismiss the charge, with or 
without prejudice in its discretion , if trial is not  
commenced within 6 months:  
     (1) from the date  of arrest if bail is set or from 
the filing of the charge, whichever is sooner, on any 
offense based on the same conduct or arising from the 
same criminal episode for which the arrest or charge was 
made . . . .  
HRPP Rule 48(b) (2000) (emphasis added).  Thus, under HRPP Rule 
48, a court must dismiss the charges upon the defendant’s motion 
when trial has not commenced within six months from the date of ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
13 arrest if bail is set or from the filing of the charge, 
whichever is sooner, taking into account any periods of delay 
excluded under the rule.  See  HRPP Rule 48(b)(1), (c) (2000).   
  Though dismissal for a violation of HRPP Rule 48 is 
mandatory, whether to dismiss charges with or without prejudice 
is subject to the discretion of the court.  HRPP Rule 48(b).  We 
have adopted factors from the federal Speedy Trial Act to guide 
our courts in exercising this discretion.  Estencion, 63 Haw. at 
269, 625 P.2d at 1044.  In determining whether to dismiss the 
case with or without prejudice, “the court shall consider, amon g 
others, each of the following factors: the seriousness of the 
offense; the facts and the circumstances of the case which led 
to the dismissal; and the impact of a reprosecution on the 
administration of this chapter and on the administration of 
justice.”  Id. (quoting 18 U.S.C.A. § 3162(a)(1) ( 1969, Supp. 
71980)).    
                       
 7 Courts of this jurisdiction that have interpreted the three 
factors (including the ICA in this case) have considered federal caselaw 
analyzing the language of the federal Speedy Trial Act from which the three -
part Estencion test was adopted.  See, e.g., State v. Coyaso, 73 Haw. 352, 
357, 833 P.2d 66, 68-69 (1992); State v. Hern, 133 Hawai i 59, 64 -65, 323 P.3d 
1241, 1246- 47 (App. 2013); State v. Kim, 109 Hawai i 59, 62- 64, 122 P.3d 1157, 
1160-62 (App. 2005).  Because the Estencion  court adopted its analysis from 
analogous provisions of the federal Speedy Trial Act, this court likewise 
considers federal caselaw regarding those provisions in interpreting the 
three Estencion factors.  There are, however, significant differences between  
HRPP Rule 48 and the federal Speedy Trial Act with respect to calculating 
 
(continued . . .)  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
14   Although not set forth as one of the three enumerated 
factors, “prejudice to the defendant may be a relevant 
consideration in the trial court’s decision to dismiss with or 
without prejudice” under HRPP Rule 48.  State v. Coyaso , 73 Haw. 
352, 357, 833 P.2d 66, 69  (1992).  However, an inquiry into 
prejudice to the defendant “will most often be inherent in the 
court’s examination of the impact of reprosecution on the 
administration of [HRPP] Rule 48 and the administration of 
justice.”  Id.  We have also concluded that “the trial court may 
consider other factors it finds to be relevant to the case 
before it” beyond those enumerated in Estencion .  Id.   
  In analyzing whether to dismiss a case with or without 
prejudice under HRPP Rule 48 and Estencion , the trial court must 
“clearly articulate the effect of the Estencion  factors and any 
other factor it considered in rendering its decision.”  State v. 
Hern, 133 Hawai8i 59, 64, 323 P.3d 1241, 1246  (App. 2013).   
                                                                        
(. . . continued) 
whether a violation occurred, including the length of elapsed time that 
results in a violation and the periods of delay excluded from calculation.  
 8 In Hern, the ICA concluded that  the trial court had abused its 
discretion when it dismissed the case without prejudice based on the court’s 
“typical practice” of HRPP Rule 48 dismissals and because the trial court 
failed to make specific findings with respect to the Estencion factors.  133 
Hawaii at 61, 323 P.3d at 1243.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
15 Accordingly, the court must explain the effect of the Estencion 
factors on its reasoning to dismiss a charge with or without 
prejudice.  Id.  The court is not required, however, to make a 
determination as to whether each individual factor weighs in 
9favor of dismissal with or without prejudice.    
  The trial court must therefore provide an “explanation 
of its consideration of the Estencion  factors[,]” and any other 
factors it considered, “and the basis for its decision.”  See 
id. at 65, 323 P.3d at 1247.  Accordingly, to address the merits 
of Fukuoka’s claim o n certiorari, we consider general principles 
applicable to each of the Estencion  factors , review the effect 
of the Estencion  factors on the district court’s decision, and 
then determine  whether the district court abused its discretion 
in dismissing the case without prejudice.   
i. Seriousness of the Offense 
 
a. Relevant Considerations 
 
  Fukuoka’s argument on certiorari relates primarily to 
the first Estencion  factor, seriousness of the offense.  
                       
 9 Additionally, even if the trial court elects to make such a 
determination with regard to some or  all of the Estencion factors, the  court 
may conclude that a factor does not favor the prosecution or the defense.  
See United States v. Montecalvo , 861 F. Supp. 2d 110, 116 (E.D.N.Y. 2012) 
(concluding that the seriousness of the offense factor “in this case does not 
weigh in favor of either party”).   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
16 Specifically, Fukuoka contends that petty misdemeanors are 
categorically non-serious offenses for purposes of determining 
whether to dismiss a case with or without prejudice for a 
violation of HRPP Rule 48.   
  The first Estencion  factor requires the court to 
consider “the seriousness of the offense.”  Estencion , 63 Haw. 
at 269, 625 P.2d at 1044.  However, considering the seriousness 
of an offense does not mean that a court simply determines 
whether the offense is serious or not serious.  Courts are 
reluctant to identify any crime as “no n-serious.”  See United 
States v. Montecalvo , 861 F. Supp. 2d 110, 114- 15 (E.D.N.Y. 
2012) (observing that a review of the caselaw concerning the 
seriousness of the offense factor reveals “very few cases that 
deem a crime ‘non -serious’ for Speedy Trial Act purposes”); 
United States v. Peppin , 365 F. Supp. 2d 261, 264 (N.D.N.Y. 
2005) (reasoning in context of the seriousness of the offense 
factor that “[c]ourts are reluctant to declare any federal 
crime . . . as ‘not serious’”).   
  For this reason, the inquiry into the seriousness of 
the offense is “more complex than awarding a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ 
determination of seriousness.”  Peppin, 365 F. Supp. 2d at 264.  
Rather, offenses vary in seriousness, and whether an offense is 
more or less serious will depend on the particular charges in a ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
17 given case.  United States v. Mancuso , 302 F. Supp. 2d 23, 26 
n.1 (E.D.N.Y. 2004) (noting that “[a]ny felony charge is 
serious” but observing that “there are degrees of seriousness” 
for purposes of the first factor).   
  Determining the relative seriousness of an offense is 
consistent with the wording of the factor itself, which requires 
that the court consider the serious ness of the offense rather 
than whether an offense is serious or non- serious.  See 
Estencion, 63 Haw. at 269, 625 P.2d at 1044.  Analyzing the 
relative seriousness of the offense  rather than making a 
categorical determination of “serious” or “non -serious” also 
facilitates a more nuanced balancing of the three Estencion 
factors.   
  Thus, although every crime may be considered “serious” 
in a general sense, the trial court in considering the first 
Estencion  factor should determine the relative seriousness of 
the particular offense at issue, i.e., whether the offense is 
more serious or less serious for purposes of dismissal under 
HRPP Rule 48 and not whether an offense is “serious” or “non -
serious.”  See United States v. Pierce , 17 F.3d 146, 149 (6th 
Cir. 1994) (rejecting a “mechanical test” b ased on federal 
sentencing guidelines “to label an offense ‘serious’ or ‘not 
serious’” and requiring courts considering the seriousness of ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
18 the offense to “carefully consider []” the “gravity” of the 
offense);  see also State v. Kim , 109 Hawai i 59, 62- 64, 122 P.3d 
1157, 1160- 62 (App. 2005) (rejecting the argument that felonies 
are categorically not serious for purposes of HRPP Rule 48 when 
there are no exacerbating circumstances such as violence).   
  Relevant caselaw likewise shows that rather than deem 
certain classes of offenses to be categorically serious or non-
serious, the trial court should consider whether the individual 
offenses charged are more serious or less serious by looking to 
a variety of factors relating to the individual offense.  The 
trial court may consider, for example, the possible penalties 
for the offense charged.  See, e.g. , Kim, 109 Hawai i at 63-64, 
122 P.3d at 1161-62 (in considering seriousness factor, noting 
that charged drug offense carried possible sentence of five 
years’ imprisonment); United States v. Koory , 20 F.3d 844, 847 
(8th Cir. 1994) (offenses were more serious based in part on 
“the length of the applicable minimum and maximum sentences”).  
Consideration of an offense’s possible p enalty may include a 
review of both the possible term of imprisonment and other 
penalties that may be implicated following a finding of guilt.  
See, e.g., Montecalvo , 861 F. Supp. 2d at 115 (observing large 
financial sum forfeited by racketeering defendants in 
considering the seriousness of the offense). ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
  Significantly, a trial court considering whether an 
offense is more or less serious for purposes of HRPP Rule 48 may 
also look to the nature of the offense charged.  See, e.g. , 
United States v. Medugno , 233 F. Supp. 2d 184, 186 (D. Mass. 
2002) (witness tampering and intimidation offenses were serious 
because they involved obstruction of justice, “a crime that 
strikes at the very heart of our justice system”);  
United States 
v. Munlyn, 607 F. Supp. 2d 394, 398-99 (E.D.N.Y. 2009) (in 
considering the seriousness of possession of a firearm as a 
convicted felon, noting that offense had been deemed a “crime of 
violence” because the “possession of a gun by its nature gives 
rise to a risk of its use in violence” (q uoting United States v. 
Dillard, 214 F.3d 88, 94 (2d Cir. 2000))); Montecalvo , 861 F. 
Supp. 2d at 116 (“the non -violent nature” of a mail fraud 
conspiracy charge “is a factor to take into consideration and 
does weigh against the seriousness of [the defendant’s] 
offense”).   
19   In evaluating seriousness, a trial court may also 
consider the combination of charges and the relation among 
multiple charges.  See, e.g., Koory, 20 F.3d at 847 (noting the 
fact of multiple charged felonies in considering the seriousness 
of the offense factor); United States v. Hastings , 847 F.2d 920, 
925 (1st Cir. 1988) (noting that defendant was indicted on ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
20 multiple drug and weapons charges and reasoning that the 
“presence of several such charges in this case  . . . militates 
strongly against dismissal with prejudice”).  
  Additionally, although the trial court may consider 
the nature of the offense charged, the inquiry into seriousness 
generally centers on the charge, rather than on the underlying 
facts of the particular case.  See Mancuso , 302 F. Supp. 2d at 
26 n.1 (the seriousness factor “ordinarily focuses solely on the 
charge rather than, e.g., the strength of the government’s case 
or the likely outcome of the proceedings,” because “[t]o do 
otherwise would inordinately complicate and extend the 
analytical process”).  Focusing on the charge rather than on the 
underlying facts is appropriate because, by the very nature of 
the HRPP Rule 48 violation, it is likely that evidence has yet 
to be proffered and analyzed for admissibility under the Hawaii 
Rules of Evidence and the state and federal constitutions; as a 
result, such evidence may not have been tested for reliability 
or accuracy.   
  Permitting the State and the defendant to present 
evidence on the underlying facts of the case, and requiring the 
court to determine whether these facts weigh in favor of 
dismissal with or without prejudice, would also unnecessarily 
complicate and lengthen proceedings that are intended to ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
21 “relieve congestion in the trial court” and to “advance the 
efficiency of the criminal justice process .”  Estencion , 63 Haw. 
at 268, 625 P.2d at 1043 (discussing the purposes of HRPP Rule 
1048).   However, when the charge itself includes information 
pertinent to the seriousness inquiry, such information may be 
relied upon by the trial court.  See, e.g. , State v. Pulse , 83 
Hawaii 229, 239, 925 P.2d 797, 807 (1996) (concluding that 
circuit court did not abuse its discretion, whe n it considered 
11that the charge involved assaultive behavior with a firearm).  
  Fukuoka’s argument in support of a categorical rule as 
to misdemeanor and petty offenses for purposes of an HRPP Rule 
                       
 10 The proceedings in this case are illustrative of the 
complications inherent in relying on the underlying facts of a case when 
analyzing the seriousness of the offense factor.  Although no evidence was 
proffered or admitted with regard to Fukuoka’s Motion to Dismiss, the State 
contended at the hearing on the Motion to Reconsider that the seriousness of 
the offense factor weighed in favor of dismissal without prejudice because 
“this was a serious accident” involving “blood at the scene” and a broken 
windshield; the State also suggested that Fukuoka fled the scene of the 
accident.  In rebuttal, Fukuoka argued that this was “hearsay, double 
hearsay.”  We do not address this issue because the district court expressly 
disavowed reliance on these allegations regarding the incident in its oral 
ruling denying the Motion to Reconsider.  However, we observe that permitting 
the proceedings to devolve into a trial -like hearing on the merits would run 
counter to the purposes of HRPP Rule 48.  
 11 See also Peppin, 365 F. Supp. 2d at 264 (reasoning that the 
defendant was charged with possession  of marijuana with intent to distribute 
and noting that “[t]he drug at issue is . . . an arguably less serious drug 
than heroin, cocaine or methamphetamine”); Koory, 20 F.3d at 847 (where the 
defendant was charged with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute 
within 1,000 feet of an elementary school, seriousness of the offense weighed 
in favor of dismissal without prejudice in part given proximity of the 
offense to a school).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
22 48 violation is misguided .  First, although an offense’s 
classification as a misdemeanor or felony and the offense’s 
possible penalty are
 a significant part of a court’s 
determination of the seriousness of an offense, a variety of 
factors should be considered in determining whether the offense 
is more serious or less serious, as discussed above.  
See, e.g., 
Pulse, 83 Hawai i at 239, 925 P.2d  at 807 (holding no abuse of 
discretion that the trial court, when considering seriousness 
factor, stated that the case involved a Class A felony, “the 
most serious level of felony ” and that the nature of the charge 
involved assaultive conduct with a 
firearm).  HRPP Rule 48 is 
best served by a comprehensive approach in which the trial court 
evaluates the relative seriousness of an offense based on 
several factors, rather than determining whether one single 
aspect of the charge renders an offense “serious” or “non -
serious.”  See Mancuso, 302 F. Supp. 2d at 26 n.1.   
  Second, we are not persuaded by Fukuoka’s argument 
that an offense’s possible sentence should play a dispositive 
role as to the first factor because of a sentence’s significance 
in constitutional jury-trial-right jurisprudence.  Whether the 
right to a jury trial attaches to an offense may be considered ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
for purposes of determining whether an offense is more serious  
12or less serious under the first Estencion  factor.   However, 
fully importing jurisprudence on the constitutional jury trial 
right into an analysis regarding a Hawai ʻi Rule of 
Penal 
Procedure is not warranted.  The right provided by HRPP Rule 48 
is intended to “ensure an accused a speedy trial.”  Estencion , 
63 Haw. at 268, 625 P.2d at 1043.  “ [I]ts purpose is also in 
furtherance of policy considerations to relieve congestion in 
the trial court, to promptly process all cases reaching the 
courts, and to advance the efficiency of the criminal justice 
process.”  Id.  In contrast, the purpose of the constitutional 
jury trial right is to, inter alia, “prevent [] miscarriages of 
justice,” “assur[e] that fair trials are provided for all 
defendants,” and “mak[e] judicial or prosecutorial unfairness 
less likely.”  See Duncan v. Louisiana , 391 U.S. 145, 157- 58 
23                        
 12 The jury trial right provided for by the Hawai i Constitution 
attaches only to “serious crime[s].”  State v. Wilson , 75 Haw. 68, 73, 856 
P.2d 1240, 1243 (1993) (deeming the relevant inquiry for constitutional jury 
trial right as whether an offense “is a petty versus serious crime”).  To 
determine whether an offense is constitutionally serious thus guaranteeing 
the right to trial by jury, courts look to “(1) treatment of the offense at 
common law; (2) the gravity of the offense; and (3) the authorized penalty.”  
Id. at 74, 856 P.2d at 1244 (citing State v. O’Brien, 68 Haw. 38, 41 -43, 704 
P.2d 883, 885- 87 (1985)).  Thus, to the extent that an offense’s 
categorization as a crime entitling a defendant to a jury trial is indicative 
of its “seriousness” within the meaning of Estencion, the fact that an 
offense has been deemed of sufficient constitutional gravity to entitle one 
to a jury trial may be considered in the context of the first Estencion  
factor.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
24 (1968) (identifying right to jury trial as a fundamental right 
13applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment).     
  In sum, when considering the seriousness of the 
offense, the trial court should conduct a particularized inquiry 
that may include considerations of the possible penalty, the 
nature of the offense charged, the combination of charges, and 
other factors that weigh on the seriousness of a particular 
offense.  Though a n offense’s possible sentence and  
categorization as a misdemeanor or petty offense are relevant to 
the inquiry, HRPP Rule 48 and the first Estencion factor require 
the court to consider the charges on a case- by-case basis.   
b. District Court’s Application of the Seriousness of the 
Offense Factor  
 
  T he dismissed charges in this case included OVUII, 
inattention to driving, reckless driving, duty upon striking an 
unattended vehicle or other property, and lack of due care.  In 
its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the district court 
                       
 13 As noted by the ICA, the difference between the constitutional 
jury trial right and HRPP Rule 48 is furt her demonstrated by this court’s 
prior rulings that an OVUII offense is subject to the protections of HRPP 
Rule 48 but that a right to trial by jury does not attach to a first -offense 
OVUII.  Compare State v. Nakata , 76 Hawai i 360, 374, 878 P.2d 699, 713 (1994) 
(holding that the constitutional jury trial right does not attach to a first -
offense OVUII based on determination that the offense is “constitutionally 
petty”), with State v. Lau , 78 Hawai i 54, 60, 890 P.2d 291, 297 (1995) 
(holding that HRPP Rule 48 applies to driving under the influence of 
intoxicating liquor offenses because it is a crime that subjects an 
individual to a possible term of imprisonment).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
concluded that “the charges are serious in nature.”  The court 
stated that “commission of the crime of OVUII can result in 
significant harm to life and property by way of vehicular 
accidents due to intoxicated driving.”  The court also 
referenced the multi ple charges, stating that “[t]he remaining 
charges in this case are inextricably tied to the charge of 
OVUII.”  Lastly, the court determined that although OVUII is a 
petty offense for purposes of the constitutional right to a jury 
trial, it would “not extend the same analysis” for determining 
the gravity of OVUII for purposes of HRPP Rule 48.  
 
25   As stated, i n evaluating the seriousness of the 
offense, the trial court may consider possible penalties, the 
nature of the offense charged, the combination of charges, and 
other factors.  Here, the district court observed that 
intoxicated driving poses a safety risk to others on the 
highways and that the OVUII offense was linked to the other four 
charges in this case.  The district court also correctly 
rejected the contention that the charged offenses were not 
serious merely because they did not entitle Fukuoka to a jury 
trial.  Thus, the district court explained its reasoning in ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
26 relation to the first Estencion factor, applying relevant 
14considerations in concluding that the offenses were “serious.”    
ii. Facts and Circumstances of the Case that Led to Dismissal 
 
a. Relevant Considerations  
 
 Under the second Estencion  factor, a court in 
determining whether to dismiss a case with or without prejudice 
for violation of HRPP R ule 48 must consider “the facts and the 
circumstances of the case which led to the dismissal.”  
Estencion , 63 Haw. at 269, 625 P.2d at 1044.  In evaluating the 
facts and circumstances of the case, the court should focus on 
“the culpability of the conduct that led to the delay.”  United 
States v. Cano-Silva , 402 F.3d 1031, 1036 (10th Cir. 2005); see 
United States v. Peppin , 365 F. Supp. 2d 261, 265 (N.D.N.Y. 
2005) (under the facts and circumstances factor, “[t]he inquiry 
thus turns to who is responsible for the delay and for what 
reasons”); Wayne R. LaFave et al., Criminal Procedure  1072 (6th 
                       
 14 The district court appears to have made a categorical 
determination that the offenses charged were “serious.”  However, rather than 
give a “‘yes’ or ‘no’ determination of seriousness[,]” Peppin, 365 F. Supp. 
2d at 264, this first Estencion factor obliges courts to look to a variety of 
considerations to determine the relative seriousness  of an offense, see 
Pulse, 83 Hawai i at 239, 925 P.2d at 807.  See supra  III(A)(i)(a).  Although 
the district court examined some of these considerations, it did not indicate 
the relative seriousness of the offenses.  Such a determination would assist 
the trial court in determining whether the balance of the factors weighs in 
favor of allowing or precluding reprosecution, see infra III(B), and the 
appellate court in its review of that determination.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
27 ed. 2017) (observing that determining whether to dismiss a case 
with or without prejudice for violation of federal Speedy Trial 
Act involves weighing of “government ‘fault,’ and defense 
‘fault’”); State v. Pulse , 83 Hawaii 229, 239, 925 P.2d 797, 807  
(1996) (concluding that circuit court did not abuse its 
discretion, when it considered as a factor that the record did  
not indicate that the State sought to delay the trial) .  
  Relevant considerations within this factor may include 
whether the delay was caused by the State’s neglect or 
deliberate misconduct.  United States v. Bert , 814 F.3d 70, 80 
(2d Cir. 2016); see United States v. James , 861 F. Supp. 151, 
156 (D.D.C. 1994) (dismissing case
 with prejudice when federal 
Speedy Trial Act violation was based on prosecution’s failure to 
comply with the rule relating to motions to dismiss and noting 
that the court “cannot condone the Government’s failure to 
recognize and follow t
he requirements of the Federal Rules of 
Criminal Procedure”).  Similarly, the court may consider whether 
the delay was caused by the defendant’s conduct when analyzing 
this factor.  In  United States v. Taylor , for example, the 
Supreme Court concluded that a defendant’s “culpable conduct” in 
failing to appear for trial and his flight before the case was 
to be tried prevented the trial from going forward in a timely 
fashion in the first instance and was “certainly relevant as ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
28 ‘circumstances of the case which led to the dismissal.’”  487 
U.S. 326, 340 (1988)
. 
  
The trial court should  also consider delays caused by 
the court itself.  See, e.g., United States v. Ramirez , 973 F.2d 
36, 39 (1st Cir. 1992) (“When a [Speedy Trial Act] violation is 
caused by the court or the prosecutor, it weighs in favor of 
granting a dismissal with prejudice.”); United States v. Howard , 
218 F.3d 556, 561 (6th Cir. 2000) (acknowledging
 possibility 
that a lengthy “period of inactivity on the part of the district 
court may warrant dismissal with prejudice in some cases”); 
United States v. Moss , 217 F.3d 426, 431-33 , 436 (6th Cir. 2000) 
(Gilman, J., concurring in the judgment) (noting that the text 
of the federal Speedy Trial Act “clearly expresses Congress’s 
concern that, without prodding, judges would not bring 
defendants to trial with sufficient speed” and concurring in the 
judgment remanding for an order dismissing with prejudice where 
district court had taken defendant’s motion to suppress under 
advisement for ten months) .   
  However, although neglect by the court or the State 
may be considered in determining whether the facts and 
circumstances of the case weigh in favor of dismissal with or 
without prejudice, a finding of neglect or intentional 
misconduct is not necessary to determine that this Estencion ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
29 factor weighs in favor of a dismissal with prejudice.  See  
Ramirez, 973 F.2d 
at 38–39  (affirming a dismissal with 
prejudice, reasoning that “ [n]othing unusual occurred ” in the 
case and “district court merely lost track of the [ Speedy Trial 
Act] deadline” and noting that violations caused by the court or 
prosecutor weigh in favor of granting dismissal with 
15prejudice).   
b. District Court’s Application of the Facts and Circumstances 
Factor 
 
  The district court concluded in this case that the 
facts and circumstances that led to dismissal weighed in favor 
of dismissal without prejudice.  In support of its conclusion, 
the court reasoned that “[n]one of the continuances were at the 
request of the prosecution.”  The court further determined that 
                       
 15 In addition to considering the reasons for the delay, some courts 
give consideration to the length of the delay in analyzing this second 
factor.  See, e.g., Bert , 814 F.3d at 81 n.7 (considering the length of delay 
in the context of facts and circumstances leading to dismissal but 
acknowledging that it is also “intertwined with the element of prejudice”).  
However, the length of delay is most appropriately considered when analyzing 
the third Estencion factor, impact of reprosecution on the administration of 
HRPP Rule 48 and on the administration of justice.  See, e.g., State v. Kim, 
109 Hawai
i 59, 64-65, 122 P.3d 1157, 1162-63 (App. 2005) (analyzing the 
length of delay under the third Estencion
 factor); United States v.  Koerber, 
813 F.3d 1262, 1285 (10th Cir. 2016) (stating that the “length of delay” is 
relevant when assessing the impact of reprosecution on the federal Speedy 
Trial Act and on the administration of justice).  Thus, although the length 
of delay in a given case may be considered by a trial court in determining 
whether an HRPP Rule 48 dismissal should be with or without prejudice, it is 
most appropriately considered in the context of the third Estencion  factor 
and will be discussed in greater detail below.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
30 “the prosecution had no control over the process of” resolving 
the subpoenas duces tecum filed by Fukuoka and the County’s 
resulting Motion to Quash.16   
 
 As disc ussed, when evaluating the facts and 
circumstances that led to the dismissal, the court should 
consider “the culpability of the conduct that led to the delay.”  
United States v. Cano
-Silva, 402 F.3d 1031,  1036 (10th Cir. 
2005).  While Fukuoka’s discovery request triggered the County’s 
Motion to Quash, it was followed by multiple continuances over a 
two-month period before the motion was resolved.  Nothing 
indicates that Fukuoka requested the discovery to delay trial.  
See United States v. Peppin, 365 F. Supp. 2d 261, 264 (N.D.N.Y. 
2005) (noting that, 
under this factor, one of the main 
considerations is the reasons for the delay).  Further, the 
rescheduling of the trial was attributable to court congestion, 
insofar as the March 25, 2015 trial date was rescheduled to 
April 14, 2015, due to a previously scheduled proceeding.   
  The district court appears to have determined that the 
second Estencion factor weighed in favor of dismissal without 
                       
 16 The district court also appears to have considered the length of 
delay in this case within the second Estencion  factor, as it concluded that 
the 18-day delay was not “substantial.”  For the reasons discussed , see 
infra, III(A )(iii)(a) , the district court’s conclusion is analyzed within the 
context of the third Estencion factor. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
31 prejudice because the State was not to blame for the delay, the 
County had the right to file the Motion to Quash, and the 
prosecution had no control over the process.  O ur caselaw, 
however, has emphasized that the prosecution shares with the 
court and the defendant the “responsibility for carrying out the 
speedy-trial requirements of [HRPP] Rule 48. ”  
Coyaso, 73 Haw. 
at 356, 833 P.2d at 68 (quoting State v. English , 68 Haw. 46, 
53, 705 P.2d 12, 17 (1985)); State v. Faalafua , 67 Haw. 335, 
339, 686 P.2d 826, 829 (1984) (quoting State v. Soto, 63 Haw. 
317, 321, 627 P.2d 279, 281 (1981)).   
  Accordingly, the court, the prosecution, and the 
defendant have a responsibility to facilitate timely resolution 
of proceedings, including discovery issues involved in a case 
17and moving the case forward.    
  Thus, simply because the County filed the Motion to 
Quash does not relieve the court and the parties from seeking to 
                       
 17 The rule governing discovery, HRPP Rule 16, helps to expedite the 
discovery process, thereby allowing parties to get to trial more quickly.  
See State v. Dowsett , 10 Haw. App. 491, 497 –98, 878 P.2d 739, 743 (1994) 
(“Faithful adherence to discovery obligations serves the public interest: 
Discovery provides the basic information which is necessary to expedite 
trials . . . .”); see also  HRPP Rule 16(b)(2) (2012) (“the prosecutor shall 
use diligent good faith efforts” to facilitate the obtaining of discovery 
when material or information is sought from the possession of other 
government entities that would otherwise be discoverable if it had been 
within the control of the prosecutor, but if the prosecutor’s efforts are 
unsuccessful , “the court shall issue suitable subpoenas or orders to cause 
such material or information to be made available to defense counsel”) . ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
fulfill the requirements of HRPP Rule 48.  However, the record 
in this case does not disclose whether the district court, the 
prosecution, or the defense bore any responsibility for the 
18duration of the delay in resolving the Motion to Quash.   
Additionally, the final continuance that resulted in the HRPP 
Rule 48 violation was a result of court congestion and not the 
19actions of the parties
.   Here, t he district court fully 
acknowledged that periods of delay caused by court congestion 
are excludable only when the congestion is attributable to 
exceptional circumstances.  
While the court did not delineate 
its consideration of the court’s shared responsibility  for the 
trial delay in addressing the facts and circumstances that led 
to the dismissal, the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law 
indicate that the district court did not minimize its 
32                        
 18 The district court found  that the prosecution had no control over 
the resolution of the discovery dispute between Fukuoka and the County.   
 19 It is noted that although Fukuoka was arraigned on October 28, 
2014, an initial trial date was not set by the district court until February 
20, 2015, the date that the County’s Motion to Quash was ruled upon.  An 
earlier setting of the trial date may have helped the district court and the 
parties to be more cognizant of the approaching expiration of the time period 
to commence trial under HRPP Rule 48.  See United States v. Ramirez, 973 F.2d 
36,
 39 (1st Cir. 1992)  (“Even though a prosecutor does not bear the burden of 
monitoring the court’s compliance with the [Speedy Trial Act] in absence of 
an announced rule, district courts do look to prosecutors for assistance as 
officers of the court.”).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
responsibility for the trial continuance that resulted in the 
Rule 48 violation. 
33   On certiorari, Fukuoka’s challenge  as to the second 
factor contends that the district court erroneously  relieved  the 
State from its shared responsibility under HRPP Rule 48.  
Fukuoka, however, references no facts or circumstances that 
indicate the delay in resolving the discovery dispute should be 
attributed to a lack of due diligence by either the County or 
the State.  Additionally, even assuming that the State was not 
diligent with regard to monitoring or seeking to expedite the 
discovery matter, 
Fukuoka does not present any argument as to 
the effect of any such dilatory conduct on the period of trial 
delay or as to its impact on
 the district court’s  determination 
as to the second factor of the Estencion  analysis.  Accordingly, 
the record does not indicate 
that the district court’s 
evaluation of the second Estencion factor was based upon its 
misapplication of relevant  considerations,  and additionally, the 
effect of this factor on the reasoning of the court is set forth 
in the court’s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.  
iii.  Impact of Reprosecution on the Administration of HRPP Rule 
48 and on the Administration of Justice  
 
a. Relevant Considerations  
 
  The third Estencion factor requires the court to 
consider the impact of reprosecution on the administration of ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
HRPP Rule 48 and on the administration of justice.  Estencion , 
63 Haw. at 269, 625 P.2d at 1044.  Thus, under the third 
Estencion factor, the court evaluates considerations relating to
the purposes of HRPP Rule 48 and the administration of justice.
 
34  
  HRPP Rule 48 operates to “ensure an accused a speedy 
trial” and to further “policy considerations to relieve 
congestion in the trial court, to promptly process all cases 
reaching the courts, and to advance the efficiency of the 
criminal justice process .”  Id. at 268, 625 P.2d at 1043; see 
also State v. Jackson , 81 Hawaii 39, 53, 912 P.2d 71, 85 (1996) 
(same); State v. Hoey , 77 Hawaii 17, 29, 881 P.2d 504, 516 
(1994) (same).  “One way in which these goals are achieved is 
through the threat of sanctions for violation of HRPP Rule 48.”  
Jackson, 81 Hawai
i at 53, 912 P.2d at 85.  The rule’s sanction 
of a dismissal with prejudice creates an incentive for courts to 
“design and implement efficient and fair procedures to decrease 
the potential for delay ” and for prosecutors “to design 
screening procedures to ensure that as much as possible those  
cases that may be disposed of by means other than trial are 
removed from the criminal justice system as quickly as ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
possible.”  Id. (quoting State v. Kahawai , 9 Haw. App. 205, 210-
2011, 831 P.2d 936, 939 (1992)).
   
35   In analyzing the third  Estencion  factor, however, the 
court must also consider the impact of reprosecution on the 
administration of justice generally.  Courts have noted that the 
“government can always argue that reprosecution furthers the 
public’s interest in bringing [defendants] to trial.”  State v. 
Kim, 109 Hawai i 59, 64, 122 P.3d 1157, 1162 (App. 2005) (quoting 
United States v. Williams , 314 F.3d 552, 559- 60 (11th Cir. 
2002)).  On the other hand, the administration of justice is 
also furthered by the timely and efficient adjudication of 
criminal cases.  See Jackson, 81 Hawai i at 54, 912 P.2d at 86 
(observing that a remedy that increases congestion in the courts 
“disgraces the administration of justice”); United States v. 
Koory, 20 F.3d 844, 849 (8th Cir. 1994) (observing that 
                       
 20 Thus, it may be argued that only dismissal with prejudice 
effectuates the purposes of the rule and so, the impact of reprosecution on 
the administration of HRPP Rule 48 weighs in favor of dismissal with 
prejudice.  See Jackson, 81 Hawai i at 53 n.13, 912 P.2d at 85 n.13 (dismissal 
without prejudice “[i]n effect  . . . rewards unacceptable delay with further 
delay” (quoting Robert L. Misner, Speedy Trial: Federal and State Practice  
300 (1983))).  Although the argument may have validity, this consideration 
alone is an insufficient basis for dismissal with prejudice.  See United 
States v. Koory , 20 F.3d 844, 849 (8th Cir. 1994)  (“Reprosecution always 
involves some element of increased burden on the  administration of justice 
and hinders the [Speedy Trial ] Act’s goal of swift prosecution, yet the Act 
does not mandate that every dismissal be with prejudice.”).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
36 permitting reprosecution may result in an “increased burden on 
the administration of justice”) .   
  These diverse and often competing interests in 
furthering the administration of HRPP Rule 48 and in serving the 
administration of justice are inherent in every case.  There 
are, however, circumstances that are unique to each case that 
are relevant  to these interests and that a court may consider in 
analyzing the third Estencion  factor.  See United States v. 
Godoy, 821 F.2d 1498, 1506 (11th Cir. 1987) (stating  that the 
defendants failed to show “any unique circumstances” that weigh 
on the impact of reprosecution on the administration of the 
speedy trial rule and on the administration of justice).  For 
example, the court may consider whether the State or the court’s 
conduct in the case reflect a pattern of lack of diligence, 
thereby suggesting that dismissal with prejudice is necessary to 
vindicate the purposes of HRPP Rule 48 and justice generally.  
See United States v. Giambrone , 920 F.2d 176, 180- 81 (2d Cir. 
1990) (“A pattern of disregard for speedy trial rights is also 
detrimental to the administration of the criminal justice system 
since delays risk the loss of important evidence, and repetitive 
prosecutions on the same charges cause wasteful replication of 
effort.”). ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
  Prejudice to the defendant may also be considered when 
analyzing the impact of reprosecution on the administration of 
HRPP Rule 48 and on the administration of justice.  Coyaso , 73 
Haw. at 357, 833 P.2d at 69.  Prejudice to the defendant in the 
context of a statutory speedy trial violation “may take many 
forms” and is often closely related to the length of delay , 
insofar as the length of the delay in a given case may be 
relevant to the extent that it causes prejudice to the 
defendant.  United States v. Taylor, 487 U.S. 326,  340, 341 n.13 
(1988) (“ The longer the delay, the greater the presumptive or 
actual prejudice to the defendant, in terms of his ability to 
prepare for trial or the restrictions on his liberty  . . . .”); 
United States v. Hastings , 847 F.2d 920,  929 (1st Cir. 1988) 
(identifying “length of delay” as a “ proxy for direct proof of 
actual prejudice” because “stretching delay to greater and 
greater extents tends ineluctably to provoke prejudice”) .  
Longer delays, for example, may more significantly impair a 
defendant’s ability to mount an effective defense.  See, e.g., 
United States v. Jones , 601 F.3d 1247, 1257- 58 (11th Cir. 2010) 
(observing in context of the third factor that the brief length 
of delay did not impair the defendant’s ability to present his 
37 defense).   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
38   Although the prejudice caused to a defendant by the 
trial delay may be considered in determining the impact of 
reprosecution on the administration of HRPP Rule 48 and on the 
administration of justice, this court has cautioned that 
prejudice to the defendant is not a “mandatory factor to be 
considered by the trial court prior to ordering dismissal with 
prejudice” for an HRPP Rule 48 violation.21  Coyaso, 73 Haw. at 
355, 833 P.2d at 68.  Rather, the Coyaso court held that 
“dismissal with prejudice may be warranted without a specific 
finding that the defendant has been prejudiced by the delay.”  
Id. at 356, 833 P.2d at  68.  Indeed, to consider the absence of 
prejudice to be a consequential consideration in analyzing the 
third 
Estencion factor would essentially adopt the considerably 
higher standard used in constitutional speedy trial 
jurisprudence despite the fact that HRPP Rule 48 is intended to 
provide broader protections than the analogous constitutional 
guarantee.  See id. at 355-56, 833 P.2d at 68 (observing that 
HRPP Rule 48’s purpose is “broader than the constitutional right 
to a speedy trial” and rejecting the ICA’s conclusion that a 
showing of prejudice was required to prohibit reprosecution 
                       
 21 Fukuoka makes no substantive argument with respect to prejudice 
in his application for a writ of certiorari to this court, and therefore, we 
do not address this consideration.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
following an HRPP Rule 48 violation because prejudice is a 
mandatory factor to consider in constitutional speedy trial 
analysis); see also  Wayne R. LaFave et al., Criminal Procedure 
1069 (6th ed. 2017) (describing that federal and state statutes 
guaranteeing the right to a speedy trial are necessary in part 
because the constitutional right is inadequate to ensure timely 
proceedings and because defendants “as a class need some 
additional basis upon which to compel the government to try them 
promptly”).  Therefore, although the presence of prejudice to 
the defendant may be of substantial importance in analyzing the 
third Estencion factor, there is no requirement that the absence 
of prejudice “be separately considered prior to di smissal with 
prejudice under Rule 48(b).”  Coyaso , 73 Haw. at 357, 833 P.2d 
at 69. 
39 b. District Court’s Application of the Impact of Reprosecution 
Factor 
 
  The district court determined that “the seriousness of 
the offenses and the facts and circumstances that led to the 
dismissal outweigh any impact of a reprosecution on the 
administration of [HRPP Rule 48], and on the administration of 
justice.”  The court reasoned that, with respect to  the impact 
of reprosecution, there had been “no showing of any prejudice to 
the defendant” and that “a reprosecution furthers the public’s 
interest in bringing criminal defendants to trial.”  The ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
40 district court also determined that the delay of 18 days in 
violation of HRPP Rule 48 in this case was not “substantial.”   
  As discussed, the trial court is required to explain 
the effect of the Estencion  factors on its reasoning to dismiss 
a charge with or without prejudice.  Hern, 133 Hawai i at 64, 323 
P.3d at 1246.   With respect to the third factor, the district 
court’s explanation is not clear.  On the one hand, the court 
determined that the first and second factors outweighed “any 
impact of reprosecution ,” which suggests that the district court 
concluded that permitting reprosecution in this case would have 
an adverse impact on the administration of HRPP Rule 48 and the 
administration of justice.22  On the other hand, the court 
concluded that reprosecution would serve the public ’s interest .   
  T he district court’s conclusion that “a reprosecution 
furthers the public’s interest in bringing c riminal defendants 
to trial” would  inherently be applicable in every case in which 
an HRPP Rule 48 violation occurred.  Relying on such a 
consideration in analyzing the third 
Estencion factor would 
essentially put a thumb on the scale in favor of dismissal 
without prejudice for every HRPP Rule 48 violation, which is 
                       
 22 The district court in its oral order denying the Motion to 
Reconsider stated that “given the short delay[, it did] not find that there 
would be a significant impact of  reprosecution under [HRPP] Rule 48.”   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
contrary to the requirement that the trial court consider the 
three Estencion factors as they apply to the ci rcumstances of 
each individual case.  See  Hern, 133 Hawai i at 64-65, 323 P.3d 
at 1246-47 (requiring the trial court to analyze and articulate 
the effect of the Estencion factors as they apply to each HRPP 
Rule 48 violation).  
41   T he district court also concluded in its Findings of 
Fact and Conclusions of Law that the 18- day delay was not 
“substantial.”  However, identif ying a delay as “substantial”  or 
“not substantial ,” based merely on the number of days of delay , 
could create a situation in which a motion to dismiss for an 
HRPP Rule 48 violation would be  brought just before commencement 
of the trial in order to make the delay more “substantial.”   
Creating an incentive for strategic timing of a motion to 
dismiss would not appear to benefit the administration of 
justice or HRPP Rule 48 itself.  Rather, the brevity of a delay, 
if considered, should be viewed in the context of any potential 
impact on the administration of justice or of  any prejudice 
23resulting to the defendant.   Correspondingly, a long delay may 
                       
 23 While the district court separately “note[d]” in analyzing the 
third Estencion factor that Fukuoka had made no showing of prejudice, the 
absence of prejudice is not a consequential consideration under the third 
factor, see Coyaso, 73 Haw. at 355 -57, 833 P.2d at 68 -69, as such a 
requirement would run counter to HRPP Rule 48’s purpose of providing broader 
 
(continued . . .)  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
42 be significant in evaluating whether to permit reprosecution, 
insofar as a lengthy delay may reflect a lack of due diligence 
on the part of the State or the court and adversely impact the 
administration of HRPP Rule 48 and the administration of 
justice.  See  United States v. Giambrone , 920 F.2d 176,
 180-81 
(2d Cir. 1990).  
  Accordingly, although the district court could have 
more clearly explained its reasoning regarding the third 
Estencion factor, the court’s ultimate assessment that the first 
and second factors outweighed any impact of the third factor 
indicates that the court recognized th e adverse impact of 
reprosecution on the administration of HRPP Rule 48 and on the 
administration of justice.  Fukuoka made no specific challenge 
on certiorari regarding the district court’s analysis of the 
third Estencion factor, which implicitly favor ed Fukuoka’s 
position, and the record does not indicate that relevant 
considerations were mis applied by the district court to the 
extent the court’s evaluation of this factor  was affected.    
                                                                        
(. . . continued) 
protection than the constitutional speedy trial guarantee .  See supra 
III(A)(iii)(a ).  It appears that the district court correctly did not weigh 
the absence of prejudice against Fukuoka  (or at least not to any significant 
degree), as the court found that the first two Estencion factors outweighed 
the third factor, thus indicating that the court did not consider the absence 
of prejudice as a consequential consideration.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
43 B. Dismissal With or Without Prejudice 
  In analyzing whether to dismiss a case with or without 
prejudice for a violation of HRPP Rule 48, the court must 
evaluate each Estencion  factor and determine whether the balance 
of the factors weighs in favor of permitting or prohibiting 
reprosecution.  See State v. Hern, 133 Hawai i 59, 65, 323 P.3d 
1241, 1247 (App. 2013) (“The trial court ’s explanation of its 
consideration of the Estencion  factors and the basis for its 
decision will permit meaningful appellate review. ”); United 
States v. Clymer, 25 F.3d 824, 831 (9th Cir. 1994) (observing 
that the three factors must be balanced and that no one factor 
is dispositive);  United States v. Montecalvo , 861 F. Supp. 2d 
110, 116 (E.D.N.Y. 2012) (noting that even when seriousness of 
the offense factor weighs in favor of dismissal without 
prejudice, “seriousness alone is not determinative” and must be 
weighed against the other two factors).  When conducting that 
analysis, trial courts must consider the factors as they apply 
to each individual case.  See Hern, 133 Hawai i at 65, 323 P.3d 
at 1247 ( remanding to the trial court because the court relied 
on a blanket policy to dismiss without prejudice rather than 
“considering the Estencion  factors and exercising its discretion 
based on the particular circumstances ” of the case) .  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
44   The district cou rt concluded with regard to the first 
Estencion  factor that although the charges in this case involve 
petty misdemeanor offenses, the charges were serious in nature 
as the crime of OVUII can result in significant harms .  The 
court also found that the other charges in this case were 
inextricably tied to the charge of OVUII.  As to the second 
Estencion factor , the court found that the facts and 
circumstances in this case did not weigh in favor of dismissal 
with prejudice because none of the continuances we re at the 
request of the prosecution and the prosecution had no control 
over the County’s Motion to Q uash.  Fukuoka’s contention that 
the State was responsible for the delay of trial is not 
supported by the record.  As to the third Estencion factor, 
relating to the impact of reprosecution on HRPP Rule 48 and the 
administration of justice, the district court concluded that any 
impact was “outweighed”  by the first and second factors.  T his 
conclusion acknowledged the adverse impact of reprosecution on 
the administration of HRPP Rule 48 and on the administration of 
justice in this case.  As to each Estencion  factor, the district 
court, under the circumstances of this case, sufficiently 
applied relevant considerations within its analysis.  
  T he district court also appropriately considered 
whether the balance of the factors weighed in favor of ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
permitting or prohibiting reprosecution.  In reaching its 
decision, the district court evaluated each Estencion  factor, 
sufficiently explained under the circumstances of this case the 
effects of the Estencion  factors on its reasoning, and weighed 
the Estencion  factors against one another.  We therefore 
conclude based on the record in this case--and in light of the 
applicable principles that guide a court in the exercise of its 
discretion --that the district court did not abuse its discretion 
in dismissing the charges without prejudice.    
45 IV. CONCLUSION 
  For the fore going reasons, the district court ’s entry 
of the Order Dismissing Without Prejudi ce was not an abuse of 
discretion.  According ly, we affirm the ICA ’s Judgment on 
Appeal.
