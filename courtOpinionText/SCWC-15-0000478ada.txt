RECKTENWALD, C.J., NAKAYAMA, McKENNA, WILSON, AND EDDINS,  JJ.  
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J.  
I. Introduction 
This case arises from Stanford Carr Development, LLC’s 
(“Carr”) application for a Special Management Area (“SMA”) use  
 2 
    
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
  
  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
permit to build affordable housing (“the Project”) within the 
County of Maui’s SMA. The Protect and Preserve Kahoma Ahupua ‘a  
Association (“PPKAA”) filed a petition to intervene in the SMA 
use permit application proceedings with the Maui Planning 
Commission (“Commission”) seeking to address the Project’s environmental and aesthetic impacts. The Commission denied 
PPKAA’s petition on the grounds that it failed to demonstrate its interests were different from those of the general public
, 
as required by the Rules of Practice and Procedure for the Maui Planning Commission (“MPC”) § 12-201-41 (2010). The Commission 
then approved Carr’s SMA use permit application. 
PPKAA appealed the Commission’s denial of its petition to 
intervene and approval of Carr’s SMA use permit application to 
the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (“circuit court”), which 
affirmed the Commission’s decision
s. On appeal, the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals (“ICA”) determined PPKAA had standing to intervene as a matter of right and that PPKAA was 
denied procedural due process to protect its Hawai‘i Constitution 
article XI, section 9 right to a clean and healthful 
environment, as defined by the Coastal Zone Management Act (“CZMA”). 
The ICA also held the Commission was required to make 
findings on the Project’s consistency with the Maui County 
general and community plans pursuant to Hawai‘i Revised Statutes  
 3 
  
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(“HRS”) § 205A-26(2)(C) (2017).  The ICA vacated the circuit 
court’s decision and remanded to the Commission. 
On review of Carr’s certiorari application, we agree with 
the ICA that (1) PPKAA sufficiently demonstrated that it had standing to intervene in the SMA use permit proceedings; (2) the CZMA is a law relating to environmental quality for the purposes 
of article XI, section 9 of the Hawai‘i Constitution and that 
PPKAA was denied procedural due process to protect its right to 
a clean and healthful environment; and (3) the Commission was required to make findings on the Project’s consistency with the 
general and community plans pursuant to HRS § 205A
-26(2)(C). 
We therefore affirm the ICA’s October 13, 2020 judgment 
vacating the circuit court’s June 19, 2015 findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order denying appeal and final judgment, 
and we remand to the Commission for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 
II. Background 
A. Commission proceedings 
Pursuant to HRS § 205A-
28 (Supp. 1979), “[n]o development 
shall be allowed in any county within the [SMA] without 
obtaining a permit in accordance with this part.” The 
Commission implements the CZMA, including SMA management under HRS ch. 205A.  See HRS § 205A-1 (defining “authority” as the county planning commission); HRS § 205A-26; Maui County Charter  
 4 
    
  
 
   
 On September 27, 2012, the Planning Department received  
Carr’s SMA use permit application for the Project.  The Project 
proposed the construction of approximately 203 housing units and  
three resident parks on 24.354 acres of undeveloped land south 
of the Kahoma stream channel. The project site was located 
within the County of Maui’s SMA and within “Project District 4”  
of the West Maui Community Plan.   The West Maui Community Plan 
described  Project District 4 as follows:  
 
  
 
  
  
 
 
 
    
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
§ 8-8.4 (2002) (stating that the Commission acts “as the authority in all matters related to the Coastal Zone Management 
law”). The Commission is part of the Maui County Department of 
Planning (“Planning Department”).  See Maui County Department of Planning, Department Organization Chart FY20 (2019).

This project district involves approximately 24 acres
bounded by Kahoma Stream, Front Street, Kenui Street, andHonoapiilani Highway. The project district is intended to provide a mixture of commercial/business and multi -family 
and senior citizen residential uses. There shall also be 6 
acres of park land within the project district, including a
linear park or greenway adjacent to the south bank ofKahoma Stream, from Honoapiilani Highway to Front Street,at least 60 feet wide and approximately 1.5 acres in size. The extension of Wainee Street from its present terminus at
Kenui Street to Front Street, as well as the realignment of
Kenui Street shall also be considered. Said roadwayimprovements should be developed and funded in conjunctionwith appropriate government agencies. The remaining acres in the project district shall be evenly divided between the
commercial/business uses, and the multi -family and senior 
citizen residential uses, to the greatest extent
practicable.

 On February 7, 2014, the Maui County Council (“Council”)   
adopted Resolution no. 14-14 (“Resolution 14-14”), citing HRS  
§  201H-38.   The resolution approved the Project subject to 4

Maui County Council, West Maui Community Plan 52 (1996).2 
Carr’s application noted the Project was “partially in 
compliance”  with the West Maui Community Plan, but it proposed a 
combined park area of 1.75 acres instead of the  6  acres of park 
land required by the community plan.  However, Carr requested  
that the Project be exempted as an HRS § 201H-38 (2017) 
affordable housing project from Maui County Code (“MCC”) ch.  
2.80B,  “General Plan and Community Plans,” in order for the 
Project to be “deemed compliant”  with the West Maui Community 
Plan.  3

(a) The corporation may develop on behalf of the State or 
with an eligible developer, or may assist under a
government assistance program in the developmentof, housing projects that shall be exempt from all statutes, ordinances, charter provisions, and rules of any government agency relating to planning, zoning,
construction standards for subdivisions, development and
improvement of land, and the construction of dwelling unitsthereon; provided that:
(1) The corporation finds the housing projectis consistent with the purpose and intent of 
this chapter, and meets minimum requirements of 
health and safety;(2) The development of the proposed housingproject does not contravene any safetystandards, tariffs, or rates and fees approved
by the public utilities commission for public

specified modifications, and “provided that [Carr] shall comply 
with all statutes, ordinances, charter provisions, and rules of 
governmental agencies relating to planning, zoning and 
construction standards for subdivisions, development and improvement of land, and the construction of units thereon, except for the exemptions specified in Exhibit ‘2’[.]”  Exhibit 
2 included an exemption from MCC ch. 2.80B “to permit the 
project to proceed without obtaining a community plan amendment.” 
On June 5, 2014, PPKAA, pro se, filed a petition to 
intervene in the SMA use permit proceedings.  PPKAA described itself as “an unincorporated organization dedicated to preserving, protecting and restoring the natural and cultural 
environment of the Kahoma ahupua‘a[.]”  PPKAA maintained that its members all owned homes within the Kahoma ahupua‘a. 
PPKAA argued it had standing to intervene as a matter of 
right under MPC 
§ 12-201 -
41 (1993)5 because its members owned 
utilities or of the various boards of water 
supply authorized under chapter 54;(3) The legislative body of the county in which
the housing project is to be situated shall
have approved the project with or without modifications[.] 
MPC § 12- 201- 41(b) provides: 
All persons who have a property interest in land subject tocommission action, who lawfully reside on said land, or candemonstrate they will be so directly and immediately
affected by the matter before the commission that their5

land adjacent to the Project, and the Project would diminish the 
use, enjoyment, and rental value of their properties. PPKAA 
also asserted the Project would have “adverse impacts on 
protected resources within the Coastal Zone Management Area,” and that the interests PPKAA sought to protect were the “same 
interests” protected by the CZMA and the Hawai‘i Constitution. 
The petition listed various ways in which the Project would 
allegedly impact CZMA interests, including access to public beaches, adequate public recreation areas, protecting coastal ecosystems, investigating the presence of Hawaiian burial sites, 
and protecting scenic resources. The petition also noted that 
the Project did not conform to the community plan as required by HRS § 205A-
26(2)(C), and that it conflicted with the general 
plan’s goal of protecting open spaces.6 
On June 13, 2014, Carr filed a memorandum in opposition to 
PPKAA’s petition to intervene, arguing PPKAA had not 
interest in the proceeding is clearly distinguishable from
that of the general public shall be admitted as parties
upon timely application for intervention. 
At the time the petition was filed, HRS § 205A -26(2)(C) provided: “No 
development shall be approved unless the authority has first found . . . 
[t]hat the development is consistent with the county general plan and zoning. 
Such a finding of consistency does not preclude concurrent processing where a
general plan or zoning amendment may also be required.” (Emphasis added.)
Additionally, MCC § 2.80B.030(B) (2014) provides in pertinent part, 
“The countywide policy plan, Maui island plan, and community plans authorized in this chapter are and shall be the general plan of the County[.]”  
(Emphasis added.) Therefore, in Maui County, community plans are part of the
general plan. 6

distinguished its members’ concerns from those affecting the 
general public, as required by MPC § 12-201-41(b). 
On June 24, 2014, the Commission held its regular meeting, 
at which members of the public were allowed to testify for up to three minutes each regarding the Project.  Multiple PPKAA members raised concerns regarding whether the current storm 
drain system would be able to accommodate the Project and the 
effects on Hawaiian cultural and gathering rights, beach access, and traffic congestion. 
The Commission then held a public hearing on Carr’s SMA use 
permit application, during which Carr gave a presentation discussing the Project’s impacts on water drainage, traffic, and environmental resources. 
The Commission then heard from PPKAA on its petition to 
intervene, as mandated by MPC § 12-201-45 (1993).
7 Michele 
Lincoln (“Lincoln”) spoke on behalf of PPKAA. Lincoln contended 
that PPKAA had standing to intervene and suffered injuries 
distinguishable from the general public. She testified that PPKAA members lived within 500 feet of the Project and would experience the Project’s impacts to traffic, beach access, 
tsunami evacuation congestion, the cultural and historic 
MPC § 12- 201- 45 provides: “All petitions to intervene shall be heard 
and ruled upon prior to the commission taking final action on an
application.” 7

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
importance of the land, storm water drainage, scenic views, and 
to the sale and rental values of their properties. 
Carr countered that PPKAA’s petition did not show its 
members suffered an actual or threatened injury in fact, and that the concerns raised were not “uniquely confined to these petitioners” and would be addressed in the regular SMA permit 
approval process. 
The Commission then denied PPKAA’s petition to intervene 
and orally approved Carr’s SMA use permit application.  The Commission did not enter oral or written findings regarding 
Carr’s SMA use permit application. 
On September 23, 2014, the Commission issued its written 
findings of fact (“FOFs”), conclusions of law (“COLs”), and 
order denying PPKAA’s petition to intervene.  The Commission 
determined PPKAA was not entitled to intervention under MPC § 12-201-41(b) because it “failed to demonstrate that they will 
be so directly and immediately affected by the matter before the 
Commission that their interests are clearly distinguishable from that of the general public.” The Commission also concluded that PPKAA failed to show a threatened injury traceable to Carr’s 
actions. 
On October 23, 2014, PPKAA appealed the Commission’s 
September 23, 2014 order and June 24, 2014 oral approval of 
Carr’s SMA use permit to the circuit court.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
B. Circuit court proceedings 
1. PPKAA’s arguments 
PPKAA, now represented by counsel, argued the Commission 
erred in denying its motion to intervene because Hawai‘i courts 
appl y 
less restrictive administrative standing requirements 
where environmental interests are involved based on article XI, 
section 9 of the Hawai‘i Constitution,8 and that it had shown an 
“injury in fact” sufficient for standing.  PPKAA also argued the 
Commission denied it procedural due process, and that it had been entitled to a “full hearing” under HRS ch. 91.  PPKAA 
asserted the Commission erred in failing to find that the 
Project was consistent with the general and community plans, as required by HRS § 205A-36(2)(C).  Although the Council had exempted Carr from obtaining plan amendments under the MCC, 
PPKAA argued this did not excuse Carr from the SMA permit 
procedures under HRS ch. 205A. 
Article XI, section 9 of the Hawai‘ i Constitution provides: 
Each person has the right to a clean and healthful
environment, as defined by laws relating to environmental 
quality, including control of pollution and conservation,protection and enhancement of natural resources. Any person may enforce this right against any party, public orprivate, through appropriate legal proceedings, subject to 
reasonable limitations and regulation as provided by law . 8

   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
2. Carr’s arguments9 
Carr argued PPKAA was not entitled to intervention because 
its members’ status as adjacent landowners did not confer an 
interest sufficient for standing, PPKAA failed to show that its interests were distinguishable from the general public, and its petition did not specify the injuries to its members. Carr 
maintained PPKAA was not denied procedural due process because 
it was afforded a hearing on its petition to intervene and was given unlimited time for oral argument to establish standing. 
Carr argued Resolution 14-14 and HRS § 201H-38 exempted the 
Project from the general and community plan requirements, and the Commission was not required to find that the Project was consistent with the community plan. 
3. Circuit court’s FOFs, COLs, and order 
On June 19, 2015, the circuit court issued its FOFs, COLs, 
and order denying PPKAA’s appeal and affirming the Commission.
10 
The circuit court’s COLs included the following. PPKAA was not entitled to intervention as a matter of right because it failed to show its interests were clearly distinguishable from those of the general public. PPKAA was afforded notice and an 
opportunity to be heard on its petition to intervene and was 
therefore not denied due process. The Project was a qualified

housing project under HRS ch. 201H, the Project had been granted 
an exemption from the general plan via Resolution 14 -14, and the 
Commission’s determination that the Project was exempt from the general plan was not clearly erroneous. 
PPKAA appealed to the ICA. 
C. ICA memorandum opinion 
On September 14, 2020, the ICA issued its memorandum 
opinion vacating the circuit court’s June 19, 2015 order and 
final judgment and remanding to the Commission. Protect and 
Preserve Kahoma Ahupua‘a Ass’n v. Maui Planning Comm’n (PPKAA), 
CAAP- 
15-0000478 (Sept. 14, 2020) (mem.).  
The ICA held that the Commission restrictively interpreted 
MPC 
§ 12
-201-41(b)’s standing requirements because environmental 
plaintiffs need not assert an injury different in kind from an 
injury to the public to establish standing. PPKAA, mem. op. at 
8-9 (citing In re Application of Maui Elec. Co. (MECO), 141 
Hawai‘i 249, 270, 408 P.3d 1, 22 (2017) (“Environmental 
plaintiffs must meet this three
-part standing test but need not 
assert an injury that is different in kind from an injury to the 
public generally.”)).  This less rigorous standing requirement 
drew support from article XI, section 9 of the Hawai‘i 
Constitution. PPKAA, mem. op. at 9 (citing Sierra Club v. 
Dep’t. of Transp., 115 Hawai‘i 299, 320, 167 P.3d 292, 313 
(2007)). The ICA stated that, in order to demonstrate standing  
 13 
  
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
    
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
to intervene, plaintiffs must demonstrate an injury in fact, which requires them to show that they suffered an actual or 
threatened injury fairly traceable to the defendant’s actions, 
and that a favorable decision would likely provide relief. 
PPKAA, mem. op. at 9-10 (citing MECO, 141 Hawai‘i at 270, 408 
P.3d at 22). 
Reviewing the Commission’s FOF/COLs de novo, ICA determined 
PPKAA demonstrated a threatened injury in fact in its petition 
and at the June 24, 2014 public hearing, noting that PPKAA members had testified as to concerns regarding the Project’s 
effect on storm water runoff, increased traffic, and adverse 
impacts on the tsunami evacuation zone. PPKAA, mem. op. at 12-15. Therefore, the ICA ruled PPKAA had been “so directly and 
immediately affected” by the Project that it was entitled to intervene as a matter of right in the SMA permit application proceedings.  PPKAA, mem. op. at 16-17. 
The ICA also held that PPKAA was denied procedural due 
process to protect its right to a clean and healthful 
environment under article XI, section 9 of the Hawai ‘
 i 
Constitution
. PPKAA, mem. op. at 17. The ICA applied a two-
step analysis in determining PPKAA had a due process right to a 
hearing: (1) whether PPKAA sought to protect a “property 
interest,” and (2) if so, what specific procedures were required to protect it. PPKAA, mem. op. at 18.  
 14 
  
 
 
 
 
 
    
  
   
  
  
  
   
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The ICA held that the CZMA is a law relating to 
environmental quality that defines the right to a clean and 
healthful environment under article XI, section 9.  PPKAA, mem. 
op. at 19. Therefore, because PPKAA’s petition sought to protect environmental and aesthetic interests under the CZMA and 
the Hawai‘i Constitution, it had asserted a protected property 
interest.  PPKAA, mem. op. at 18 
-19.  
The ICA then determined that the risk to PPKAA’s right to a 
clean and healthful environment was high absent a contested case 
hearing because the Project could have adverse impacts to the 
SMA, and PPKAA had no other meaningful opportunity to be heard 
because the Commission had approved the permit application on the same day it denied PPKAA’s motion to intervene
.  PPKAA, mem. 
op. at 21. Furthermore, the burden of affording a contested case hearing was slight because the Commission was “already required to consider the concerns posited in PPKAA’s petition to intervene.” Id. Therefore, PPKAA was entitled to a contested 
case hearing, “which includes the right to submit evidence and argument on the impact of the Project on the asserted property interest.” PPKAA, mem. op. at 21-22. 
Finally, the ICA held that the Commission was required 
under the CZMA to make findings on the Project’s consistency with the Maui County general and community plans.  PPKAA, mem. op. at 22. Although the Council exempted the Project from MCC  
 15 
     
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
ch. 2.80B through Resolution 14-14, the ICA determined it did 
not relieve the Commission of making findings pursuant to HRS 
§ 205A-26(2)(C), which conditioned the approval of SMA use 
permits on findings that “[t]he development is consistent with the county general plan and zoning.” PPKAA, mem. op. at 23-24.  Therefore, on remand, the Commission was required to make 
specific findings on the Project’s consistency with the general 
and community plans.  PPKAA, mem. op. at 24. 
On October 13, 2020, the ICA filed its judgment on appeal. 
D. Certiorari application 
Carr’s application for certiorari (“Application”) raises 
five questions: 
1. Whether the ICA gravely erred in holding that the
Commission restrictively interpreted its standing 
requirements.2. Whether the ICA gravely erred by finding that [PPKAA]sufficiently asserted threatened injuries -in-fact to its 
members. 
3. Whether the ICA gravely erred by relying on the public
testimony portion of the Commission hearing to support the Petition. 4. Whether the ICA gravely erred in holding that PPKAA wasdenied procedural due process to protect their right to a 
clean and healthful environment under article XI, section
9, as defined by the [CZMA].[5.] Whether the ICA gravely erred in holding that theCommission was required to make specific findings on the Project’s consistency with the Maui County General and
Community Plans. 
III. Standards of Review 
A. Constitutional law 
This court reviews questions of constitutional law by 
exercising our own independent constitutional judgment based on  
 16 
   
 
 
  
  
 
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the facts of the case. State v. Phua, 135 Hawai‘i 504, 511-12, 
353 P.3d 1046, 1053-54 (2015).  Therefore, questions of 
constitutional law are reviewed under the right/wrong standard.   
Phua, 135 
Hawai‘i at 512, 353 P.3d at 1054.  
B. Administrative agency appeals 
Review of a decision made by the circuit court upon its
review of an agency’ s decision is a secondary appeal. The 
standard of review is one in which this court must determine whether the circuit court was right or wrong in
its decision, applying the standards set forth in HRS § 91– 
14(g) (1993) to the agency ’s decision. 
Sierra Club v. Office of Planning, 109 Hawai‘i   411, 414, 126 P.3d 
1098, 1101 (2006) (citations and alterations omitted).  
HRS § 91-14(g) (Supp. 2016) provides: 
(g) Upon review of the record, the court may affirm thedecision of the agency or remand the case with instructions 
for further proceedings; or it may reverse or modify thedecision and order if the substantial rights of thepetitioners may have been prejudiced because theadministrative findings, conclusions, decisions, or orders 
are: 
(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory
provisions;(2) In excess of the statutory authority orjurisdiction of the agency;
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure;
(4) Affected by other error of law;(5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on thewhole record; or
(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized
by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarrantedexercise of discretion. 
IV. Discussion 
A. PPKAA had standing to intervene in the SMA permit 
application proceedings 
Carr argues the ICA erred in holding the Commission 
restrictively interpreted its standing requirements  and   
 17 
  
 
 
 
    
  
 
 
 
  
  
     
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
misapplied the standard for standing because PPKAA failed to 
show that it suffered an injury in fact.11 
The ICA determined that the Commission had restrictively 
interpreted its standing requirements, noting environmental plaintiffs need not assert an injury different in kind from the general public, and that this “less rigorous standing 
requirement” draws support from article XI, section 9 of the 
Hawai‘i Constitution. PPKAA, mem. op. at 9, 11-12 (citing Sierra 
Club, 115 Hawai
‘i at 320, 167 P.3d at 313). The ICA then held 
that PPKAA had established a threatened injury in fact and 
demonstrated it was “so directly and immediately affected” that 
it was entitled to intervention as a matter of right.  PPKAA, mem. op. at 12-17.  
Our decision in MECO has clarified that petitioners have a 
right to intervene where they have established their right to a clean and healthful environment pursuant to article XI, section 
9 of the Hawai‘i Constitution. 141 Hawai‘i at 266-67, 408 P.3d 
at 18-
19.  As discussed in the next section, PPKAA had a 
protectable property interest in the right to a clean and 
Carr also argues the ICA erred by relying on the public testimony 
portion of the Commission’s hearing in determining that PPKAA demonstrated an
injury in fact because the public testimony was not presented as part of 
PPKAA’s petition. However, the ICA’s discussion of the public testimony was

also show that it is entitled to request a review of the agency 
determination,” which requires PPKAA to establish “an actual or 
threatened injury [that is] fairly traceable to the defendant’s actions; and a favorable decision would likely provide relief for the plaintiff’s injury.” Id. at 270, 408 P.3d at 22 
(quotation marks and citations omitted). The ICA correctly 
concluded that PPKAA “assert[ed] harm to legally protected interests in a clean and healthful environment.” Id. As the 
ICA identified, PPKAA alleged “direct personal environmental and aesthetic interests, including those of adjacent landowners” and “potential actual injury from the Project” which was “fairly traceable to Carr Development’s SMA permit application” and from 
which the Commission’s decision could provide relief. PPKAA, 
mem. op. at 16. Therefore, PPKAA had standing to intervene in the SMA permit application proceedings. B. PPKAA was denied procedural due process to protect its 
right to a clean and healthful environment under article
XI, section 9 of the Hawai‘i Constitution, as defined by the 
CZMA

Furthermore, it appears that PPKAA’s property interest in the right to 
a clean and healthful would entitle it standing under MPC § 12 -201- 41(b).
MPC § 12- 201- 41(b) provides that “[a]ll persons who have a property interest 
in land subject to commission action . . . shall be admitted as parties upon

values do not constitute a protectable property interest, citing 
Sandy Beach Defense Fund v. City Council of Honolulu (Sandy 
Beach), 70 Haw. 361, 773 P.2d 250 (1989). 
This court has stated that “[c]onstitutional due process 
protections mandate a hearing whenever the claimant seeks to protect a ‘property interest,’ in other words, a benefit to 
which the claimant is legitimately entitled.” Pele Defense Fund 
v. Puna Geothermal Venture, 77 Hawai‘i 64, 68, 881 P.2d 1210, 
1214 (1994). 
This court conducts a two-step analysis to 
determine whether there was a due process right to a contested case hearing, considering: “(1) [whether] the particular 
interest which [the] claimant seeks to protect by a hearing [is] ‘property’ within the meaning of the due process clauses of the 
federal and state constitutions, and (2) if the interest is 
‘property,’ what specific procedures are required to protect it.” Sandy Beach, 70 Haw. at 376, 773 P.2d at 260.  
Sandy Beach involved a challenge to an SMA use permit 
application by community members, some of whom lived near the proposed development.  70 Haw. at 366, 773 P.2d at 254. The community group claimed their personal, economic, and aesthetic 
interests, such as their view of the ocean and value of their 
properties, would be injured by the development. 
70 Haw. at 
367, 773 P.2d at 255. We stated that “[t]o have a property interest in a benefit, a person clearly must have more than an

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
abstract need or desire for it. [They] must have more than a 
unilateral expectation to it. [They] must, instead, have a 
legitimate claim of entitlement to it.” 70 Haw. at 377, 773 
P.2d at 260 (citations omitted).  We then held that the community group’s interests were “of an aesthetic and environmental nature” and did not rise to the level of a 
property interest within the meaning of the due process clause 
of the Hawai‘i Constitution. 70 Haw. at 377, 773 P.2d at 261. 
However, this court distinguished Sandy Beach in MECO, 
which involved the Sierra Club’s assertion of its members’ 
constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment under 
article XI, section 9 of the Hawai‘i Constitution. MECO, 141 
Hawai‘i at 264-65, 408 P.3d at 16-17. This court noted that the 
petitioners in Sandy Beach “did not identify any source granting them a substantive legal right to enforcement of environmental 
laws .” 141 
Hawai‘i at 265, 408 P.3d at 17.  In contrast, the 
Sierra Club’s asserted right to a clean and healthful 
environment was “not a freestanding interest in general 
aesthetic and environmental values” or a “unilateral 
expectation,” but a “right guaranteed by the Constitution and 
statutes of this state.” 141 Hawai‘i at 264-65, 408 P.3d at 16-
17. 
As in MECO, PPKAA did not merely assert unilateral 
expectations of aesthetic and environmental values, but a  
 21 
  
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
protectable property interest in its constitutional right to a 
clean and healthful environment under article XI, section 9 of 
the Hawai‘i Constitution.  Article XI, section 9 states that 
“[e]ach person has the right to a clean and healthful 
environment, as defined by laws relating to environmental quality, including control of pollution and conservation, 
protection and enhancement of natural res
ources.”  This court 
has held that article XI, section 9 is self-executing and that 
the right to a clean and healthful environment is “defined by existing law relating to environmental quality.” MECO, 141 
Hawai‘i at 261, 408 P.3d at 13; see Cty. of Hawai‘i v. Ala Loop Homeowners (Ala Loop), 123 Hawai‘i 391, 417, 235 P.3d 1103, 1129 
(2010), abrogated on other grounds by Tax Found. v. State, 144 
Hawai‘i 175, 439 P.3d 127 (2019). 
HRS ch. 205A is a law “relating to environmental quality” 
for the purposes of article XI, section 9. 
The stated purpose 
of HRS ch. 205A is to “preserve, protect, and where possible, to restore the natural resources of the coastal zone of Hawai[‘]i.” 
HRS § 205A 
-21 (Supp. 1977).  The provisions of HRS ch. 205A also 
“expressly require consideration of issues relating to the 
preservation or conservation of natural resources.” Ala Loop, 
123 Hawai‘i at 410, 235 P.3d at 1122; see HRS § 205A-4 (Supp. 
1989) (providing that agencies “shall give full consideration to 
ecological, cultural, historic, esthetic, recreational, scenic,

and open space values” in implementing the CZMA program); HRS 
§ 205A-26 (Supp. 1994) (setting guidelines for the review of 
developments proposed in special management areas); HRS § 205A-
28 (Supp. 1979) (prohibiting development in special management 
areas without a permit).  
Additionally, HRS § 607-25 (Supp. 1997), which authorizes 
the recovery of attorney’s fees against private parties who undertake development without the approvals required under various laws, including chapter 205A, also “reflects the 
legislature’s determination that chapter 205[A] is an 
environmental quality law.”
13 Ala Loop, 123 Hawai‘i at 410, 235 
P.3d at 1122. As we recognized in Ala Loop, the legislative 
purpose of HRS § 607
-25 was to allow the award of attorney’s 
fees in cases involving illegal development by private parties 
“to improve the implementation of laws to protect health, environmental quality, and natural resources[.]”  Id. (quoting 1986 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 80, § 1 at 104-05) (emphasis added). 
In enacting HRS § 607-25, the legislature recognized that HRS 
ch. 205A “implements the guarantee of a clean and healthful environment established by article XI, section 9.” Id. 
HRS § 607- 25(c) provides: “ For purposes of this section, the permits or 
approvals required by law shall include compliance with the requirements for
permits or approvals established by chapters . . . 205A[.]”  (Emphasis
added.) 13  
 23 
  
 
 
  
  
 
   
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Therefore, HRS ch. 205A is a “law relating to environmental 
quality” for the purposes of article XI, section 9. 
Having determined that PPKAA asserted a protected property 
interest to a clean and healthful environment, we turn to whether PPKAA’s right to procedural due process was violated. Procedural due process “requires that parties be given a 
meaningful opportunity to be heard. This implies the right to 
submit evidence and argument on the issues.”  Application of 
Hawai‘i Elect. Light Co., 67 Haw. 425, 430, 690 P.2d 274, 278 
(1984). 
However, “[d]ue process is not a fixed concept 
requiring a specific procedural course in every situation,” and 
“calls for such procedural protections as the particular 
situation demands.” 
Sandy Beach, 70 Haw. at 378, 773 P.2d at 
261 (quoting Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 481 (1972)) (emphasis added). In determining the procedures required to comply with constitutional due process, courts consider the following factors: “(1) the private interest which will be 
affected; (2) the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such 
interest through the procedures actually used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or alternative procedural 
safeguards; and (3) the governmental interest, including the 
burden that additional procedural safeguards would entail.”  Id. 
Here, the private interest was PPKAA’s constitutional right 
to a clean and healthful environment. The risk of an erroneous  
 24 
  
 
   
  
  
    
  
 
 
  
   
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
deprivation of PPKAA’s interest was high absent PPKAA’s 
participation in the contested case hearing because the Project 
could have adverse and long-term environmental impacts to the 
SMA. See MECO, 141 Hawai‘i at 266, 408 P.3d at 18. As the ICA 
recognized, PPKAA raised concerns regarding the Project’s 
potential impacts to the SMA, including loss of scenic and open 
space resources, drainage and runoff impacts, and impacts on the 
tsunami evacuation zone. PPKAA, mem. op. at 14
-15. While PPKAA 
members testified about the Project at the public hearing and the hearing on its petition to intervene, they were not able to 
submit evidence or cross-examine opposing witnesses, which the 
Commission’s rules would have allowed them the opportunity to do 
had their petition been granted.
14 See MECO, 141 Hawai‘i at 269, 
408 P.3d at 21. As adjacent landowners to the Project, PPKAA’s 
members would likely bear the brunt of adverse impacts to the 
SMA, and their knowledge of the area could have supplemented the findings of the environmental assessment. 
Finally, as the 
Commission was already required to consider the CZMA in making its decision on Carr’s SMA use permit, it would not unduly burdensome to allow PPKAA to participate in the contested case 
hearing. 141 Hawai‘i at 266, 408 P.3d at 18. 
The Commission’s rules provide for procedures where intervention is
granted and requires pre- hearing mediation, the appointment of a hearing 
officer, and the opportunity for cross -examination, discovery, and the 
submission of evidence. MPC §§ 12 -201- 53 (1993); 12- 201- 54 (1993); 12- 201- 60
(1993); 12- 201- 67 (1993); 12- 201- 69 (1993). 14

Therefore, the ICA did not err in holding that PPKAA was 
denied procedural due process under the circumstances and was 
entitled to participate in a contested case hearing on Carr’s 
SMA use permit application. C. The Commission was required to find the Project was 
consistent with the community plan pursuant to HRS § 205-
26(2)(C) 
Carr argues the ICA erred in holding the Commission was 
required to make findings on the Project’s consistency with the 
community plan because Resolution 14-14 exempted the Project 
from MCC ch. 2.80B to “permit the project to proceed without 
obtaining a community plan amendment.” Carr further contends that, under HRS § 201H-38, qualified housing projects “shall be exempt” from all statutes relating to the development and 
improvement of land, which would include HRS § 205A-26(2)(C). 
HRS § 201H-38(a) states that, subject to certain 
provisions: 
The corporation may develop on behalf of the State or with
an eligible developer, or may assist under a governmentassistance program in the development of, housing projects that shall be exempt from all statutes, ordinances, charter provisions, and rules of any government agency relating to
planning, zoning, construction standards for subdivisions,
development and improvement of land, and the constructionof dwelling units thereon[.] 
(Emphasis added.) 
The ICA held that, while Resolution 14-14 exempted the 
Project from MCC ch. 2.80B, it did not relieve the Commission 
from its duties under HRS § 205A-26(2)(C) to make findings on  
 26 
    
 
 
 
 . . . 
     
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the Project’s consistency with the community plan.  PPKAA, mem. 
op. at 22. Under HRS § 205A-26(2)(C): 
(2) No development shall be approved unless the authority
has first found: 
(C) That the development is consistent with the county 
general plan and zoning. Such a finding of consistency
does not preclude concurrent processing where a general plan or zoning amendment may also be required . 
(Emphasis added.) 
We agree with the ICA that Resolution 14-14 did not exempt 
the Project from HRS § 205A-26(2)(C) and that the Commission was 
required to find that the Project was consistent with the West Maui Community Plan. While HRS § 201H-38(a) states that 
qualified housing projects “shall be exempt” from statutes and 
ordinances related to the development and improvement of land, 
these exemptions are contingent on the legislative body of the county, in this case, the Council, approving the proposed 
project “with or without modifications[.]” In this case, 
Resolution 14-14 provided that the Project “shall comply with all statutes, ordinances, charter provisions, and rules of governmental agencies relating to planning, zoning and 
construction standards for subdivisions, development and 
improvement of land, and the construction of dwelling units  
 27 
    
 
 
    
 
  
  
 
 
  
    
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
thereon,” except for the attached specified exemptions.15 
(Emphasis added.) Resolution 14-14 exempted the Project from 
MCC ch. 2.80B, but it did not exempt the Project from HRS 
§ 205A-26(2)(C). However, even if Resolution 14-14 had included HRS § 205A-26(2) among its listed exemptions, the Council would not have been 
able to exempt the Project from HRS § 205A-26(2)’s requirements. 
Although Carr argues that HRS § 205A-26(2)(C) is a law “relating to the development and improvement of land” that may be exempted 
under HRS § 201H-38, HRS ch. 201H does not define “relating to” 
or provide guidance as to how broadly or narrowly to read that phrase. The United States Supreme Court has recognized that the 
words “relating to” are “broad and indeterminate,” and “extended 
to the furthest stretch of their indeterminacy, stop nowhere.” 
Mellouli v. Lynch, 575 U.S. 798, 811-12 (2015) (cleaned up).  “Context, therefore, may tug in favor of a narrower reading.” 
Mellouli, 575 U.S. at 812. (cleaned up). 
HRS ch. 205A is, viewed as a whole, an environmental law. 
See HRS § 205A-21 (declaring that it is the state’s policy to 
“preserve, protect, and where possible, to restore the natural 
Carr acknowledges that HRS § 201H -38(a)’s use of the word “shall” is 
qualified by subsections (1) through (4). HRS § 201H -38(a)(3) requires the 
legislative body of the county in which the housing project is proposed to
approve the project “with or without modifications.”  Carr also acknowledges 
that Resolution 14 -14 provided that the Project “shall comply” with all 
statutes not specifically exempted. 15

resources of the coastal zone of Hawai[‘]i.”); Morgan v. Planning 
Dept., Cty. of Kauai, 104 
Hawai‘i 173, 181, 86 P.3d 982, 990 
(2004) (“The CZMA is a comprehensive State regulatory scheme to 
protect the environment and resources of our shoreline areas.”) 
(emphasis added).  While “managing development” is also one of the CZMA’s objectives, HRS § 205A-2 describes this objective as 
“[i]mprov[ing] the development review process, communication, 
and public participation in the management of coastal resources and hazards.” To the extent the CZMA affects development, it is 
“in order to preserve, protect, and, where possible, restore the 
natural resources of Hawai‘i’s coastal zone,” not to “improve” the land. Morgan, 104 Hawai‘i at 182, 86 P.3d at 991. We 
therefore do not construe HRS ch. 205A as a law “relating to” 
the development and improvement of land for the purposes of 
exemptions under 201H-38. 
Therefore, the Commission was required under HRS § 
205A-
26(2)(C) to make findings on the Project’s consistency with the 
West Maui Community Plan. 
V. Conclusion 
We therefore affirm the ICA’s October 13, 2020 judgment 
vacating the circuit court’s June 19, 2015 findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order denying appeal and final judgment, 
and we remand to the Commission for further proceedings 
consistent with this opinion.
