ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins , JJ.)  
 
On
 June 28, 2021, Petitioner/Defendant-Appellee/Appellee 
Stanford Carr Development, LLC (“Carr”) filed a motion for 
reconsideration challenging Section IV.C of our June 16, 2021 opinion. 
Carr argues this court misapprehended the record by holding 
the Maui Planning Commission (“Commission”) did not make requisite findings regarding whether  Carr’s affordable housing Electronically Filed

Dkt. 42 ODMR2 project (“the Project”) was consistent with the West Maui 
Community Plan bef ore approving a special management area 
(“SMA”) use permit.  We note, however, that Carr’s application 
for certiorari asked: “Whether the ICA gravely erred in holding 
that the Commissio n was required to make specific findings on 
the Project’s consistency with the Maui County General and 
Community Plans.”  Carr also represented that “the record is 
clear that the Commission did consider the West Maui Community 
Plan, even if it did not make a specific finding with respect to 
the Project’s consistency with the West Maui Community Plan.”  
(Emphasis added.)  Carr argued in its certiorari application 
that although the Commission had not found the Project 
consistent with the West Maui Community Plan, it was not 
required to do so.  Carr now argues the Commission did make a 
consistency finding by adopting the Maui Planning Department’s 
report and recommendation. 
Hawai‘i Rules of Appellate Procedure (“HRAP”) Rule 40(b) 
(2000) requires a motion to reconsider an opinion state with 
particularity the points of law or fact the court has 
misapprehended.  This court did not misunderstand Carr’s 
representations regarding the lack of a consistency finding. In 
addition, a motion for reconsideration is not a vehicle for 
arguments that could have been presented earlier.  See Citizens 
for Equitable & Responsible Gov’t v. County of Hawai‘i, 108 
Hawaiʻi 318, 335, 120 P.3d 217, 234 (2005), amended on 
reconsideration in  part (Sept. 22, 2005), citing Amfac, Inc. v. 
Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co., 74 Haw. 85, 114, 839 P.2d 10, 27 
(1992) (“The purpose of a motion for reconsideration is to allow 
the parties to present new evidence and/or arguments that could 
not have been presented during the earlier adjudicated 
motion.”); Briggs v. Hotel Corp. of the Pacific, Inc., 73 Haw. 3 276, 287 n.7, 831 P.2d 1335, 1342 n.7 (1992) (“We again remind 
litigants that a motion for reconsideration is not the time to 
relitigate old matters.”).  1
Regarding Carr’s other arguments, this court did not 
overlook or misapprehend other points of law or fact.   HRAP Rule 
40(b).  Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawaiʻi, July 7, 2021.

1Our opinion should not be read to preclude Carr from raising, and the 
Commission from considering, on remand, the arguments raised in the motion 
for reconsideration that strict compliance with the community plan is 
unnecessary to make a consistency finding in light of the Council ’s exemption 
from Maui County Code Chapter 2.80B.
