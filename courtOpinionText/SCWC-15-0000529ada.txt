OPINION OF THE COURT BY POLLACK, J.  
 
  This case arises from the nonjudicial foreclosure of 
the petitioner’s apartment  by the apartment owners ’ association  
based on unpaid assessments.   After the sale was conducted, 
petitioner filed a complaint against the association and the Electronically Filed

 purchaser of the property for wrongful foreclosure,  seeking 
relief that included damages and title to the property.  The 
trial court dismissed the complaint, finding that it failed to 
state a claim upon which relief could be granted.  Particularly, 
the court found that Hawai ‘i Revised Statutes 
(HRS) chapter 667, 
which governs foreclosures, contained a statutory bar  that 
precluded the claims in the complaint.  On appeal, the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals determined the statut
ory bar 
precluded petitioner’s claim to title of the property  against 
the purchaser but did not preclude petitioner’s claim for 
damages against the association.   
  
On certiorari, we consider whether the petitioner ’s 
claim for wrongful foreclosure, which is based on the 
association’s lack of a valid power of sale, is statutorily 
limited or barred.  Because we conclude that the petitioner’s  
claim to title of the property is not limited by HRS chapter 667  
and that its provisions do not bar a common law claim of 
wrongful foreclosure based on the lack of a power of sale, we 
hold that the complaint did state a claim against both the 
association and the purchaser 
of the apartment.  Thus, the 
dismissal of the apartment owner’s claims against both 
defendants for wrongful foreclosure and the Intermediate C ourt 
of Appeals’  partial affirmance of the dismissal were  erroneous.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 I. BACKGROUND  
  
On March 28, 2006, Christian Sakal acquired an 
apartment in the Hawaiian Monarch Condominium Project (the 
property) as a tenant in severalty.  On March 16, 2012, the 
Association of Apartment Owners of Hawaiian Monarch (AOAO 
Hawaiian Monarch or the AOAO) filed a Notice of Lien  with the 
Office of Assistant Registrar of the Land Court against Sakal’s 
property for unpaid assessments.  The Notice stated that the 
lien claimed a pre- petition amount of $11,417.91 and a post-
petition amount of $10,589.42.1  Three months later, the AOAO 
filed a Notice of Default and Intention to Foreclose on Sakal’s 
property in the Office of the Assistant Registrar of the State 
of Hawai
‘i (Assistant Registrar).   Subsequently, AOAO Hawaiian 
Monarch filed a Notice of Association’ s Non-Judicial Foreclosure 
Under Power of Sale with the Assistant Registrar, which stated 
that a public auction would be held on December 3, 2012,  
pursuant to HRS §§ 514B-146 and 667 -21 through 667-42 .   
  
Four days before the sale was scheduled to occur, 
Sakal filed a motion for p reliminary i njunction to stay the non-
judicial foreclosure sale of the property in the Circuit Court 
of the First Circuit (circuit court ).  On December 3, 2012, the 
                     
 1 Sakal filed a voluntary petition “under Chapter 13”  in the United 
States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Hawai ‘i on April 27, 2011.   
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 circuit court denied Sakal’s motion for p reliminary injunction, 
and AOAO Hawaiian Monarch held a public auction offering Sakal’s 
property for sale.  A quitclaim deed was executed after the sale 
conveying Sakal’s property to  Jonah Scott Kogen for $50,500.   
The deed was then recorded in the Office of the Assistant 
Registrar on January 16, 2013. 
  
On May 5, 2014, Sakal filed a c omplaint  against AOAO 
Hawaiian Monarch, Kogen, and K&F 1984 LLC in the circuit court.2  
The complaint alleged wrongful foreclosure against AOAO Hawaiian 
Monarch and common law trespass
 and quiet title claims against 
AOAO Hawaiian Monarch, Kogen, and K&F 1984 LLC.3  As to the 
wrongful foreclosure claim, Sakal alleged that the AOAO’s bylaws 
did not include a power of sale  that would allow it to 
nonjudicially foreclose on his property.  Additionally, Sakal 
contended that the AOAO was not granted a power of sale by 
statute.  Thus, Sakal claimed that  AOAO Hawaiian Monarch’s 
nonjudicial foreclosure was void and title should be restored to 
him. 
  
Sakal further alleged that because neither AOAO 
                     
 2 The Honorable Bert I. Ayabe presided.  
 
 3 The complaint alleged that K& F 1984 LLC was “a limited liability 
company registered in the State of Hawaii on December 31, 2012.”  The circuit 
court entered default against K&F 1984 LLC for failing to plead or otherwise 
defend against the complaint.  Sakal dismissed all claims against  K&F before 
appealing the circuit court’s final judgment to the ICA.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

(continued . . .)  
 Hawaiian Monarch nor Kogen had authority to enforce a 
nonjudicial foreclosure of an association lien, they were 
committing a continuing trespass on the property.  Sakal 
requested that the circuit court declare the foreclosure auction 
and subsequent documents transferring title null and void and 
strike such documents , as well as “any and all other recorded 
documents relating to the wrongful foreclosure,”  from the 
records of the Office of the Assistant Registrar.  Sakal also 
asked the circuit court to grant a preliminary and permanent 
injunction preventing AOAO Hawaiian Monarch and Kogen from 
enforcing the nonjudicial foreclosure and from trespassing on 
the property.  Finally, Sakal prayed for actual and treble 
damages resulting from the foreclosure and his subsequent 
eviction from his property. 
  AOAO Hawaiian Monarch filed an answer asserting  that 
Sakal’s claim was barred by, inter alia, the applicable statute 
of limitations, laches, and improper service of process.   Kogen 
did not file an answer to Sakal’s co mplaint.  
  Kogen and AOAO Hawaiian Monarch filed separate motions
to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Hawai ʻi Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) Rule 12(b)(6)
.   In the memorandum supporting 4 
                     
 4 HRCP Rule 12(b)(6) (2000) provides as follows:  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 his motion, Kogen argued that the recordation of the quitclaim 
deed on January 16, 2013, precluded  Sakal from challenging his 
right to title in the property.  Kogen asserted  that the AOAO 
had, as required by HRS § 667-101(a), submitted an affidavit 
after the public sale of the property attesting that the sale 
had been lawfully conducted.5  Kogen maintained that HRS §  667-
102(b) prevented Sakal from challenging his title to the 
                                                                              
(. . . continued) 
 
(b) How presented.  Every defense, in law or fact, to a 
claim for relief in any pleading, whether a claim, 
counterclaim, cross -claim or third -party claim, shall be 
asserted in the responsive pleading thereto if one is 
required, except that the following defenses may at the 
option of the pleader be made by motion: . . . . 
 
(6) to dismiss for failure of the pleading to state a 
claim upon whic h relief can be granted, matters 
outside the pleading are presented to and not 
excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as 
one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided 
in [HRCP] Rule 56, and all parties shall be given 
reasonable opportuni ty to present all material made 
pertinent to such a motion by [HRCP] Rule 56.  
 
 5 HRS § 667-101(a) (Supp. 2012) provides as follows:  
 
(a) After the public sale is held, the association shall 
sign an affidavit under penalty of perjury:  
 
(1) Stating that the power of sale foreclosure was 
made pursuant to the power of sale provision in the 
law or association documents;  
 
(2) Stating that the power of sale foreclosure was 
conducted as required by this part;  
 
(3) Summarizing what was done by the association;  
 
(4) Attaching a copy of the recorded notice of 
default and intention to foreclose; and  
 
(5) Attaching a copy of the last public notice of the 
public sale.  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 property once the deed and the affidavit were recorded.6  Thus, 
Sakal’s claims were barred , Kogen asserted, because the 
complaint was filed after such documents were recorded.   
  
Additionally, Kogen argued that e ven if Sakal’s claims 
were not foreclosed by section 667- 102, the claims were barred 
by HRS § 667 -60(c) (Supp. 2012 ), which provides  that “[a]ny 
action to void the transfer of title to the purchaser of 
property pursuant to a foreclosure by power of sale” must be 
filed “no later than sixty days following the recording of the 
                     
 6 HRS § 667-102(a)-(b) (Supp. 2012) provide the following in full:  
(a) The affidavit required under  section 667- 101 and the 
conveyance document shall be recorded no earlier than ten 
days after the public sale is held but not later than 
forty-five days after the public sale is held.  The 
affidavit and the conveyance document may be recorded 
separately and on different days.  After the recordation, 
the association shall mail or deliver a recorded copy to 
those persons entitled to receive the public notice of the 
public sale under section 667 -96(c). 
(b) When both the affidavit and the conveyance document are 
recorded:  
(1) The sale of the unit is considered completed;  
(2) All persons claiming by, through, or under the 
unit owner and all other persons having liens on the 
unit junior to the lien of the association shall be 
forever barred of and from any and all  right, title, 
interest, and claims at law or in equity in and to 
the unit and every part of the unit, except as 
otherwise provided by law;  
(3) The lien of the association and all liens junior 
in priority to the lien of an association shall be 
automatically extinguished from the unit; and  
(4) The purchaser shall be entitled to immediate and 
exclusive possession of the unit.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 affidavit required by section 667- 32.”  Because Sakal failed to 
file his complaint within sixty days of the recording of the 
affidavit, Kogen contended that the claims were  barred and the 
complaint should be dismissed.  AOAO Hawaiian Monarch’s 
memorandum submitted in support of its motion restated Kogen’s 
memorandum verbatim. 
  In oppo sition, Sakal argued that HRS §  667-102(b)(2) 
provided an exception to the time bar for claims “as otherwise 
provided by law.”  The claim was not statutorily barred, Sakal  
maintained,  because the foreclosure was unlawful from its 
inception due to the AOAO’s lack of a power of sale .  Sakal 
contended that since he was challenging the validity of the 
foreclosure sale based on the AOAO’s lack of a power of sale, 
the statutory bar did not apply to his claim.  
  Sakal also argued that the time bar set forth in HRS 
§ 667-60(c) did not apply because the AOAO’s nonjudicial 
foreclosure of his property was governed by p art VI of HRS 
chapter 667 and HRS § 667-60(c) was located within p art IV, 
making it inapplicable to the AOAO’s foreclosure . 
  T he circuit court ruled that HRS § 667-102(b)(2) , 
which Kogen argued prevented Sakal from challenging title to the 
property once the deed and the affidavit were recorded, was 
applicable to Sakal’s claim because he was a unit owner.  On 
this basis, t he court granted Kogen’s and the AOAO ’s motion s and ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
9 
 dismissed Sakal’s claims against both parties with prejudice.  
The circuit court thereafter issued a final judgment.   Sakal 
timely appealed. 
II. ICA PROCEEDINGS 
  
The Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA ) issued a 
published opinion that partially affirmed and partially vacated 
the circuit court’s grant of the motions to dismiss.7  The ICA 
held that Sakal’s wrongful foreclosure claim was not  barred by 
HRS § 667-102 because the statute only bars claims “in and to 
the unit” 
and not all claims arising out of wrongful and 
unlawful nonjudicial foreclosures, such as claims for money 
damages.  The ICA reasoned that the statute barred any claim to 
title to the property by Sakal b ecause he failed to challenge 
the nonjudicial foreclosure of the property prior to the 
recordation of the affidavit and the quitclaim deed.  However,  
the ICA concluded that Sa kal had stated a claim for wrongful 
foreclosure on which damages could be granted because the AOAO 
lacked a power of sale permitting it to foreclose on Sakal’s 
property.   
  
Therefore, the ICA held that the circuit court erred 
in dismissing Sakal’s complaint in its entirety against AOAO 
                     
7 The opinion is published as Sakal v. Ass’n of Apartment Owners of 
Hawaiian Monarch, 143 Hawaiʻi 219, 426 P.3d 443 (App. 2018).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

(continued . . .)  
 Hawaiian Monarch.  The ICA vacated the dismissal of Sakal’s 
claims for damages against the AOAO arising out of the wrongful 
foreclosure and remanded the case to the circuit court.  The ICA 
affirmed the dismissal of all claims against Kogen and all 
claims “at law or in equity”  against the AOAO “that seek right, 
title, or interest in and to the Property.”  
  
AOAO Hawaiian Monarch and Sakal both sought certiorari 
review of the ICA’s judgment on appeal.8   
                     
 8 The AOAO’s application for writ of certiorari challenged the 
ICA’s conclusion that the AOAO was not statutorily empowered to conduct a 
nonjudicial foreclosure on Sakal’s property absent a power of sale provision 
in the AOAO’s bylaws.  This court rejected the AOAO’s application on December 
28, 2018.  Sakal v. Ass’n of Apartment Owners of Hawaiian Monarch , No. SCWC-
15-0000529, 2018 WL 6818901 (Haw. Dec. 28, 2018) (order rejecting application 
for writ of certiorari).  It is noted that on July 10, 2019, SB 551,  SD1, 
HD2, CD1 of 2019, A Bill for an Act Relating to Condominiums, was enacted as 
Act 282 without the Governor’s signature.  See Gov. Msg. No. 1402, (attaching 
Act 282 as pages 3– 18 of the document),  https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/  
session2019/bills/GM1402_.PDF.   Act 282 purported to retroactively grant 
apartment associations a statutory right to foreclose on members ’ apartments 
pursuant to part VI of HRS chapter 667.  Malabe v. A ss’n of Apartment Owners 
of Executive Centre , No. SCWC- 17-0000145, at 44-45 (Haw. June 17, 2020).  In 
Malabe, we concluded that it was unnecessary to consider Act 282’s effect on 
the Malabes’ claim of wrongful foreclosure because the Act was only 
applicable to foreclosures conducted under part VI of HRS chapter 667 and the 
foreclosure in Malabe  was conducted under part I of HRS chapter 667.  Id. at 
33, 52-54.  We also observed that the United  States District Court for the 
District of Hawai‘ i recently held Act 282 unconstitutional as violative of the 
Contracts Clause of Article I, § 10 of the United States Constitution.  Id. 
at 55-57 (citing Galima v. Ass’ n of Apartment Owners of Palm Court, Civ. No. 
16-00023 LEK-RT, 2020  WL 1822599 (D. Haw. Apr . 10, 2020)).   
  In this case, neither the Notice of Association’s Non -Judicial 
Foreclosure Under Power of Sale nor the Grantor’s Affidavit of Non -Judicial 
Foreclosure Under Power of Sale are included in  the record on appeal.  
Sakal’s complaint, however, indicates that the notice stated the AOAO 
intended to conduct a public foreclosure sale pursuant to HRS §§  667-21 
through 667- 42, which corresponds to part II of HRS chapter 667.  Because the 
motions to dismiss were pursuant to HRCP Rule 12(b)(6), the allegations in 
the complaint are taken to be true.  Bank of America, N.A. v. Reyes -Toledo, 
143 Hawai‘ i 249, 265, 428 P.3d 761, 777 (2018).  Thus, it is unnecessary for 
us to consider Act 282’s effect on this litigation.  See Malabe, No. SCWC- 17-***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 III.   STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Motion to Dismiss 
  This court reviews a trial court’s ruling on a motion 
to dismiss de novo.  Kamaka v. Goodsill Anderson Quinn & Stifel, 
117 Hawaiʻi 92, 104, 176 P.3d 91, 103 (2008).  
B. Statutory Interpretation 
  
The interpretation of a statute is a question of law, 
which we review de novo.  State v. Carlton, 146 Hawai ‘i 16, 22, 
455 P.3d 356, 362 (2019) (quoting State v. Lau, 78 Hawaiʻi 54, 
58, 890 P.2d 291, 295 (1995) ). 
IV. DISCUSSION 
A. The ICA Erred in Holding Sakal’s Claim to the Property W as 
Barred by HRS § 667-102(b)(2) . 
  Sakal argued before the ICA that his claim of wrongful 
foreclosure was not barred by HRS § 667 -102(b)(2) because his 
claim was based on the AOAO’ s lack of a valid power of sale.  In 
response, the AOAO and Kogen  contended that this statutory 
provision barred Sakal from seeking title to the property and 
damages once the affidavit and the deed were recorded.
  In its 
opinion, the ICA concluded that Sakal was barred from any claim 
to the property itself because he failed to challenge the AOAO’s 
                                                                              
(. . . continued)

12 
 foreclosure prior to the recordation of the AOAO’s affidavit and 
the quitclaim deed, but  that he could seek damages for wrongful 
foreclosure.  Before this court, Sakal argues that such an 
interpretation violates his constitutional right to procedural 
due process.  Thus, the ICA’s construction of HRS §  667-102 is a 
critical and potentially dispositive issue in this case, and 
accordingly we begin our analysis with a  review of the ICA’s 
statutory interpretation.9 
  This court’s construction of statutes is governed by 
well-settled principles.  State v. Carlton
, 146 Hawai‘ i 16, 22, 
455 P.3d 356, 362 (2019).  First, we examine the language of the 
statute itself.  Jaylo v. Jaylo, 125 Hawai ‘i 369, 373, 262 P.3d 
245, 249 (2011) (quoting State v. Silver, 125 Hawai‘ i 1, 4, 249 
P.3d 1141, 1144 (2011)).  Second, if the language is plain and 
                     
 9 This court has consistently held that we have a duty to review de 
novo dispositive questions of law, such as the proper interpretation of a 
statute, even when the parties have not challenged or have stipulated to an 
erroneous interpretation.  See, e.g., State v. Medeiros, 146 Hawai ‘i 1, 3 n.2, 
454 P.3d 1069, 1071 n.2 (2019) (noting that the State’s failure to challenge 
the defendant’s eligibility for a deferred acceptance of a no contest plea 
did not relieve this court of its obligation to determine whether the offense 
charged was nonprobationable, which was a dispositive question of law); 
Hawaiian Ass’n of Seventh -Day Adventists v. Wong, 130 Hawai ‘i 36, 46, 305 P.3d 
452, 462 (2013) (“We note, however, that the parties’ stipulation as to a 
question of law is not binding on the court, and does not relieve us from the 
obligation to review questions of law de novo.” (citing Chung Mi Ahn v. 
Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 126 Hawai‘ i 1, 10, 265 P.3d 470, 479 (2011))).  
Thus, Sakal’s focus on the constitutionality of the ICA’s interpretation of 
HRS § 667-102 does not “relieve us from the obligation to review questions of 
law de novo.”  LC v. MG & Child Support Enf’t Agency , 143 Hawai‘ i 302, 320, 
430 P.3d 400, 418 (2018) (Opinion of McKenna, J., writing for the court as to 
Part III.B) ( citing Wong, 130 Hawai‘i at 46, 305 P.3d at 462). ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
13 
 unambiguous, we must give effect to its plain and obvious 
meaning.  Id.  Third, implicit in statutory construction is our 
obligation to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the 
legislature, which is obtained primarily from the language of  
the statute itself.  Carlton, 146 Hawai ‘i at 22, 45
5 P.3d at 362  
(citing State v. Choy Foo, 142 Hawai ‘i 65, 72, 414 P.3d 117, 124 
(2018)).   
  Therefore, we first examine the language of the 
statute.  HRS § 667-102 provides in relevant part as follows:  
(b) When both the affidavit and  the conveyance document are 
recorded:  
. . . . 
(2) All persons claiming by, through, or under the 
unit owner  and all other persons having liens on the 
unit junior  to the lien of the association  shall be 
forever barred of and from any and all right, title, 
interest, and claims at law or in equity in and to 
the unit and every part of the unit, except as 
otherwise provided by law [.] 
. . . . 
(c) The unit owner and any person claiming by, through, or  
under the unit owner  and who is remaining in possession of 
the unit after the recordation of the affidavit and the 
conveyance document shall be considered a tenant at 
sufferance subject to eviction or ejectment.  
(Emphases added.) 
  T he ICA appears to have concluded that Sakal is “a 
person claiming by, through, or under the unit owner ” to whom 
HRS § 667- 102(b)(2) applies.  However, by its plain meaning,  the 
phrase “persons claiming by, through, or under the unit owner” 
does not include a unit owner.  In specifying that it applies to ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
14 
 “persons claiming by, through, or under the unit owner,” the 
provision contemplates at least one degree of separation between 
the identified party and the unit owner.  In other words, the 
statute on its face
 applies to extinguish only interests derived 
from the unit owner ’s interest in the property and not to any 
interest in the property retained by the unit owner. 
 
 When there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or 
indistinctiveness or uncertainty as to an expression used in a 
statute, the expression is ambiguous and the meaning of any 
ambiguous words may be sought by examining the context or 
resorting to extrinsic aids to determine legislative intent
.  
Carlton, 146 Hawai ‘i at 22, 455 P.
3d at 362 (citing Citizens 
Against Reckless Dev. v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals, 114 Hawai ‘i 184, 
194, 159 P.3d 143, 153 (2007)).  Assuming there was some 
ambiguity as to whether the legislature intended “ persons 
claiming by, through, or under the unit owner ” to include the 
unit owner themselves, which there is not, t he plain meaning of 
the text is confirmed by subsection (c) of the same statute, 
which provides that following recordation, “The unit owner and 
any person claiming by, through, or under the unit owner . . . 
shall be considered a tenant at sufferance subject to eviction 
or ejectment.”  HRS § 667 -102(c) (emphase s added) ; see State v. 
Yokota, 143 Hawai ‘i 200, 205, 426 P.3d 424, 429 (2018) (“ [L]aws 
in pari materia, or upon the same subject matter, shall be ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
15 
 construed with reference to each other.”  (quoting State v. 
Arceo, 84 Hawai‘ i 1, 19, 928 P.2d 843, 861 (1996))).  By 
specifying that subsection (c) applies to both the “unit owner” 
and “any person claiming by, through, or under the unit owner,” 
the legislature indicated that unit owners themselves  are not  
“persons claiming by, through, or under the  unit owner ” within 
the meaning of the statute.  See Yokota, 143 Hawai‘ i at 205, 426 
P.3d at 429.  To hold otherwise would render subsection (c)’s 
use 
of “unit owner” redundant, which is contrary to the 
“cardinal rule of statutory construction that courts are bound, 
if rational and practicable, to give effect to all parts of a 
statute.”  Coon v. City & Cty. of Honolulu
, 98 Hawai‘ i 233, 259, 
47 P.3d 348, 374 (2002) (“[N]o clause, sentence, or word shall 
be construed as superfluous, void, or insignificant if a 
construction can be legitimately found which will give force to 
and preserve all words of the statute .” (quoting  Franks v. City 
& Cty. of Honolulu, 7 4 Haw. 328, 339, 843 P.2d 668, 673 
(1993))). 
  Additionally, it is fundamental that when the same 
phrase is used in different part s of the same statute, it is 
presumed to have the same intended meaning.  See  State v. 
Guyton, 135 Hawai‘ i 372, 380, 351 P.3d 1138, 1146 (2015) 
(“[W]here the meaning of a word is unclear in one part of a 
statute but clear in another part, the clear meaning can be ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
16 
 imparted to the unclear usage on the assumption that it means 
the same thing throughout the statute.” (quoting Kam v. Noh , 70 
Haw. 321, 325, 770 P.2d 414, 416 (1989))).  Because HRS § 667-
102(c)’s reference to “ any person claiming by, through, or under 
the unit owner” does not encompass unit owners themselves, HRS 
§ 667-102(b)(2) ’s bar to claims by “ persons claiming by, 
through, or under the unit owner ” does not bar claims by unit 
owners themselves.  C f. Peak Capital Grp. , LLC v. Perez, 141 
Hawai‘i 160, 174, 407 P.3d 116, 130 (2017) (stating that the 
circuit court’s interlocutory foreclosure decree provided that 
“All Defendants . . . and all persons claiming by, through or 
under them .  . . will be perpetually barred of and from any and 
all right .  . . in the Property .  . . upon closing of the sale 
herein authorized. ” (emphas es added)); Fed. Home Loan Mortg. 
Corp. v. Transamerica Ins. Co., 89 Hawai‘i 157, 165, 969 P.2d 
1275, 1283 (1998) (“[T]he foreclosure order . . . expressly 
divested [defendants] ‘an d all persons claiming by, through or 
under them’ of ‘any and all right, title and interest in the 
said mortgaged property or any part thereof. ’” (emphasis 
added)).   
  Inasmuch as Sakal’s claim  to title to the property 
arises directly from his status as a unit owner  and not “by, 
through, or under” a unit owner , HRS § 667- 102(b)(2)  is 
inapplicable.  The ICA thus erred in determining that the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
17 
 provision operated to bar Sa kal from seeking recovery of the 
property.  
B. The Sixty-Day Time Limit of HRS § 667- 60(c) Is Not Applicable 
to a Claim of Wrongful Foreclosure Based on the Lack of a Power 
of Sale. 
  Before the circuit court, Kogen and the AOAO argued 
that Sakal’s claim to recover title to the unit wa s barred 
because it was not brought within the sixty- day time limit 
established by HRS § 667- 60(c).  The circuit court did not 
address this issue because it conclu ded that Sakal’s claim was 
barred by HRS § 667-102(b)(2).  Although neither Koge n nor the 
AOAO have raised this argument before the ICA or this court, we 
address the application of this statute as it is likely to be 
reasserted on remand.  Nordic PCL Constr., Inc. v. LPIHGC, LLC, 
136 Hawai‘ i 29, 44, 358 P.3d 1, 16 (2015) (“ We now turn to issues 
that may arise during th e evidentiary hearing on remand.”); 
Sentinel Ins. Co. v. First Ins. Co. of Hawai‘i, Ltd.,  76 Hawai‘i 
277, 297, 875 P.2d 894, 914 (1994) (addressing issues the court 
expected would arise on remand). 
  As the ICA stated in this case, HRS c hapter 667 “sets 
forth the procedures for foreclosure in Hawai ‘i and does not 
create a right to foreclose.”  Within HRS 
chapter 667, section 
667-60 establishes a scheme of sanctions and remedies applicable ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
18 
 when a party utilizing the foreclosure process fails to comply 
with the statute’s procedural requirements.10  The statute 
                     
 10 HRS § 667-60 (Supp. 2012) provides the following in relevant 
part: 
(a) Any foreclosing mortgagee who engages in any of the 
following violations of this  chapter shall have committed 
an unfair or deceptive act or practice under  section 480 -2: 
(1) Failing to provide a borrower or mortgagor with, 
or failing to serve as required, the information 
required by  section 667- 22 or 667-55; 
(2) Failing to publish, or  to post, information on 
the mortgaged property,  as required by  section 667 -
27 or 667-28; 
 . . . . 
(5) Holding a public sale in violation of  section 
667-25
; 
(6) Failing to include in a public notice of public 
sale the information required by  section 667-
27 or section 667- 28; 
(7) Failing to provide the information required 
by section 667- 41; 
 . . . . 
(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), the transfer of title 
to the purchaser of the property as a result of a 
foreclosure under this chapter shall only be subject  to 
avoidance under section 480 -12 for violations described in 
subsection (a)(1) to (9) if such violations are shown to be 
substantial and material; provided that a foreclosure sale 
shall not be subject to avoidance under section 480 -12 for 
violation of se
ction 667- 56(5). 
(c) Any action to void the transfer of title to the purchaser 
of property pursuant to a foreclosure by power of sale under 
part II of this chapter shall be filed in the circuit court 
of the circuit within which the foreclosed property is 
situated no later than sixty days following the recording of 
the affidavit  required by section 667 -32.  If no such action 
is filed within the  sixty-day period, then title to the 
property shall be deemed conclusively vested in the purchaser 
free and clear of  any claim by the mortgagor or anyone 
claiming by, through, or under the mortgagor.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
19 
 declares that certain enumerated violations are deemed to be 
unfair or deceptive acts or practices in violation of HRS § 480-
2.  See HRS § 667-60(a).  As unfair or deceptive acts or 
practices, these violations may subject the foreclosing party to 
the penalties prescribed in Hawai‘i’s consumer protection 
statute, HRS chapter 480.  See, e.g.,  HRS § 480-3.1 (“Any 
person, firm, company, association, or corporation violating any 
of the provisions of section 480- 2 shall be fined a sum of not 
less than $500 nor more than $10,000 for each violation [.]”). 
  The law goes on to  clarify, however, that when the 
foreclosure sale has resulted in title passing to a third- party 
purchaser, only substantial and material violations of a subset 
of the identified violations will render the underlying 
transaction void, as is generally the case when HRS chapter 480 
is violated in other contexts.11  See HRS § 667 -60(b).  And HRS 
§ 667-60(c) establishes a sixty-day time limit following the 
recordation of a power of sale affidavit during which such an 
action to void a transfer of title must be filed.   
                     
 11 Under HRS § 480 -12 (2008), “Any contract or agreement in 
violation of [HRS chapter 480] is void and is not enforceable at law or in 
equity.”  Thus, a transaction that in cludes an unfair or deceptive business 
practice is typically null and subject to rescission.  See, e.g., 808 Dev., 
LLC v. Murakami, 111 Hawai ‘i 349, 356, 141 P.3d 996, 1003 (2006) (“[B]ased 
upon the plain language of the above statutes, a contractor who fails to 
[comply with the statutory requirements] may not enforce the contract against 
the owner and, consequently, is not entitled to a mechanic’s lien upon the 
property.”). ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
20 
   Significantly, HRS § 667 -60(c) provides that the 
sixty-day time limit is applicable to “[a]ny action to void the 
transfer of title to the purchaser of property pursuant to a 
foreclosure by power of sale under part II .”12  (Emphasis added. )  
By its plain language, the statutory time limit  is only 
applicable when there is a valid power of sale; it does not 
apply when a foreclosing party is alleged to have conducted  a 
foreclosure without a power of sale.  A claim based on a lack of 
power of sale is markedly different in nature and not dictated 
by the procedures or relief prescribed in HRS chapter 667.  
Rather, such a claim is governed by Hawai‘i common law, under 
which an unauthorized nonjudicial foreclosure renders  “the sale 
of the property [] invalid and voidable at the election of the 
mortgagor, who shall then regain title to and possession of the 
property.”  Santiago v. Tanaka, 137 Hawai ‘i 137, 15 8, 366 P.3d 
612, 633 (2016) (citing Ulrich  v. Sec. Inv. Co., 35 Haw. 158, 
168 (Haw. Terr. 1939)); see also Lee v. HSBC Bank USA, 121 
Hawai‘i 287, 296, 218 P.3d 775 , 784 (2009) (holding a nonjudicial 
foreclosure sale void where the foreclosure sale was invalid  
under an applicable statute) .  In this case Sakal’s claim is not 
based on a violation of the foreclosure procedures set forth in 
                     
 12 Part II of HRS chapter 667, entitled “Power of Sale Foreclosure 
Process,” is comprised of HRS §§  667-21 through 667 -42. 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
21  
(continued . . .)  
 HRS chapter 667.  Rather, he claims wrongful foreclosure based 
on the absence of the AOAO’s power of sale.13  The wrongful 
foreclosure claim alleged by Sakal is therefore a common- law 
claim that is not subject to the HRS § 667-60(c) sixty-day time 
limit.14 
                     
 13 The “foreclosure by power of sale under part II” referred to in 
HRS § 667-60(c) means a nonjudicial foreclosure when the mortgage or other 
governing documents contain a power of sale provision.  See Malabe, No. SCWC-
17-0000145, at 46- 47 (Haw. June 17, 2020).   Under Act 282 of 2019, there are 
three means by which condominium associations may foreclose their liens: (1) 
by judicial action, (2) by nonjudicial foreclosure when the mortgage contains 
a nonjudicial foreclosure or power of sale provision, or (3) by power of sale 
foreclosure, regardless of the presence or absence of power of sale language 
in an association’s governing documents.  Id. at 46.  With respect to the 
third means, such “power of sale foreclosure” m ust be conducted under Part VI 
of HRS chapter 667.  Id.  As stated, it is unclear from the record which 
foreclosure procedures were utilized by the AOAO in this case.  See supra 
note 8.  By its express terms, the sixty -day time limit contained in HRS § 
667-60(c) applies only when there has been a “transfer of title to the 
purchaser of property pursuant to a foreclosure by power of sale under part 
II” of HRS chapter 667.  (Emphasis added.)  On remand, if it is determined 
that the AOAO conducted the foreclosure pursuant to a part of HRS chapter 667 
other than part II, such as part VI, HRS § 667 -60(c)’s 60- day time limit 
would be inapplicable to this case on that basis as well.  
  The dissent maintains that it is unnecessary to consider HRS § 
667-60(c)’s effect on this case because the AOAO possessed a power of sale to 
foreclose on Sakal’s property, even though the AOAO’s governing documents did 
not contain a power of sale provision.  Dissent at 1 -2.  As discussed in 
Malabe, the AOAO was not permitted to foreclose on Sakal’s property in the 
absence of a power of sale provision in either the  association bylaws or 
another enforceable agreement.  Malabe, No. SCWC -17-0000145, at 20.   
 
 14 Although we conclude that Sakal is not statutorily precluded from 
seeking title to the property, we note that in cases of wrongful foreclosure, 
a court has the “power to fashion an equitable relief” because wrongful 
foreclosure is a proceeding that is equitable in nature.  Santiago, 137 
Hawai‘i at 158, 366 P.3d at 633 (citing Beneficial Haw., Inc. v. Kida, 96 
Hawai‘i 289, 312, 30 P.3d 895, 918 (2001)).  This court has left open the 
question of whether, in light of the detailed statutory scheme governing the 
registration and issuance of certificates of title in the land court system, 
the equitable protections for good  faith purchasers that we recognized in 
Santiago are available with respect to registered property.  See  Wells Fargo 
Bank, N.A. v. Omiya, 142 Hawai ‘i 439, 457 n.37, 420 P.3d 370, 388 n.37 (2018).  
In light of the fact that Kogen has not yet filed an answer  in the 
proceedings, we do not consider whether Sakal’s request for the equitable 
relief of restoring the property is subject to an equitable defense.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 V. CONCLUSION 
  Based on the foregoing, we vacate in part and affirm 
in part the ICA’s judgment on appeal and remand the case to the 
circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this 
opinion.15

 15 Our disposition of this case renders it unnecessary to address 
Sakal’s argument that the ICA’s interp retation of HRS § 667 -102 violates his 
constitutional due process rights.
