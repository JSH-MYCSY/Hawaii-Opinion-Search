Circuit’s (“circuit court”) denial of his Motion to Reconsider 
Sentence (“motion to reconsider”).  Sanney argues the circuit Electronically Filed

 court1 abused its discretion by refusing to vacate his sentence 
of ten years in prison and $25,000 in fines and resentence him 
pursuant to the court’s original sentencing inclination of 
probation with up to eighteen months of imprisonment as a 
condition of probation. 
This appeal raise
s issues regarding appropriate procedures 
for cases in which a trial court provides a “sentencing 
inclination.”  We hold that here, the circuit court did not 
abuse its discretion by denying Sanney’s motion to reconsider, 
because Sanney voluntarily and knowingly entered his plea after 
acknowledging the non- binding nature of the circuit court’s 
sentencing inclination,  and the circuit court provided 
sufficient reasons for its deviation from the original 
sentencing inclination.  Therefore, we affirm the ICA’s j udgment 
on appeal affirming the circuit court’s decision to deny 
Sanney’s motion to reconsider.  
To provide guidance in future cases, however, we discuss 
procedures trial judges should follow before providing 
sentencing inclinations.  Furthermore, we prospectively hold 
that if a defendant pleads guilty or no contest in response to a 
court’s sentencing inclination , but the court later decides not 
to follow the inclination, then the court must so advise the

 defendant and provide the defendant with the opportunity to 
affirm or withdraw the plea of guilty or no contest. 
II. Background 
A. From offense to sentencing 
 
 On September 22, 2010, Sanney was indicted on one count of 
sexual assault in the second degree in violation of Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (“HRS”) § 707 -731(1)(b)(Supp. 2009)2 and one 
count of attempted sexual assault in the second degree in 
violation of HRS § 707- 731(1)(b) and HRS § 705- 5003 (1993).    
The indictment arose out of an incident that occurred in 
broad daylight on September 15, 2010 in Kapiolani Park.  In 
front of numerous eyewitnesses, Sanney allegedly cut out the 
shorts of an unconscious homeless woman and performed 
cunnilingus, then attempted vaginal intercourse with her.  
Shortly after, police officers arrived and awoke the unconscious 
                         
2 HRS § 707- 731(1)(b) provides in relevant part, “(1) A person commits 
the offense of sexual assault in the second degree if: . . . (b) The  person 
knowingly subjects to sexual penetration another person who is mentally 
incapacitated or physically helpless. . . .”  
 
3  HRS § 705- 500, titled “Criminal attempt,” provides in relevant part:  
 
(1)  A person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if 
the person:  
 (a)  Intentionally engages in conduct which would 
constitute the crime if the attendant circumstances were as 
the person believes them to be; or  
 (b)  Intentionally engages in conduct which, under the 
circumstances as the person believes them to be, 
constitutes a substantial step in a course of conduct 
intended to culminate in the person’s commission of the 
crime. . . .

 female, who indicated she did not know Sanney.  Sanney was 
arrested and taken to the Oahu Community Correctional Center.    
 At the time of his arrest, Sanney was forty- four years old, 
unemployed, and homeless.  Sanney is a veteran with a history of 
alcohol and substance abuse issues, and had participated in a 
U.S. Veterans substance abuse program starting in September 
2009; he was discharged in April 2010 for using marijuana.  
Since 1996, Sanney has had one conviction for criminal trespass 
in the second degree, four convictions for driving under the 
influence, one conviction for theft in the fourth degree, and 
was given a deferred acceptance of guilty plea for disorderly 
conduct.  Sanney also had an immigration detainer on file, and 
an Immigration Enforcement Agent informed state officials that 
Sanney would be picked up for deportation if released from state 
custody.    
 A jury trial was scheduled for Sanney, but was postponed 
several times.  The trial week was eventually rescheduled and 
Sanney, unable to post bail after his arrest, remained in 
custody at the Oahu Community Correctional Center.   
 The above information regarding the nature of the charged 
offenses and Sanney’s background was contained in Sanney’s  file 
and available to the circuit court before his change of plea.   
 During his rescheduled trial week, Sanney agreed to change 
his plea after his attorney said the judge was inclined to ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   ***  
 
5 
 sentence him to probation with up to eighteen months in jail (of 
which he had already served about ten months).  There was no 
plea agreement with the State.   The circuit court then conducted 
a change of plea hearing.  Before the change of plea colloquy 
began, Sanney’s defense attorney stated:  
Your Honor, I guess after several status conferences 
with the Court and, you know, talking back and forth with 
Mr. Sanney, this case being set for trial tomorrow morning, 
it’s Mr. Sanney’s decision to enter a guilty plea as 
charged, and I did relay to him that the Court has given us 
an inclination for probation in this case with up to 18 
months in jail, and, you know, based on  
that inclination he’s intending to change his plea.    
 
And I also did inform the Court that there is a 
federal hold that’s been placed, currently he’s facing 
deportation, and he understands that even if given 
probation, a conviction in this case will lead to automatic 
deportation.  
 
  At the beginning of the change of plea colloquy, the 
circuit court informed Sanney:  
 Now, Mr. Sanney, an inclination is not a promise . . 
. [T]here’s going to be a presentence report that’s going 
to be generated if you decide to plead guilty today . . . I 
know what relatively little the lawyers have told me about 
the case and about your background, but it’s that 
[presentence report]  that’s very important, because that’s 
going to be a more in -depth explanation of who you are, and 
your history, and your characteristics and the offense.  
 
 In addition, the Court would always consider what 
happens at the sentencing hearing -- you know the 
arguments; what, if anything, you have to say, and so on. 
So based on all of that, that’s how the Court is going to 
make its decision on what an appropriate sentence would be.  
So I can tell you that’s the inclination based on the 
representations I have.  But as you can imagine, an 
inclination is only as good as the representations it is 
based on, so you need to understand that.  
 
Sanney responded, “I do.”  After an extensive change of plea 
colloquy, the circuit court found that Sanney voluntarily, ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   ***  
 
6 
 knowingly, and intelligently entered no contest pleas to the 
charges and adjudged Sanney guilty of the charged offenses.    
 After the presentence investigation and report (“PSI”)4 was 
prepared, a sentencing hearing was held.  At the hearing, the 
circuit court expressed concern “about some of the 
representations in the PSI which, to [the circuit court], [were] 
different from the representations that were made at the time of 
the change of plea and based upon which the court did give its 
inclination of probation with an uncertain jail term.”   The 
circuit court continued the hearing so the probation officer 
could be present.    
                         
4  “PSI” is the common acronym for the confidential presentence diagnosis 
and report prepared by judiciary probation officers pursuant to HRS § 706 -
602(1) (1993 & Supp. 2012), which provides in part:  
 
 (1)  The pre-sentence diagnosis and report shall be made by 
personnel assigned to the court or other agency designated by 
the court and shall include:  
(a)  An analysis of the circumstances attending the 
commission of the crime;  
(b)  The defendant’s history of delinquency or criminality, 
physical and mental condition, family situation and 
background, economic status and capacity to make 
restitution or to make reparation to the victim or victims 
of the defendant’s crimes for loss or damage caused 
thereby, education, occupation, and personal habits;  
. . . . 
(e)  Any other matters that the reporting person or agency 
deems relevant or the court directs to be included. 
. . . .   
 
      
      
      
      
 
 
“In enacting the Code, the legislature changed the Proposed Draft 
by substituting the phrase ‘pre -sentence diagnosis’ for the phrase 
‘pre-sentence investigation[.]’”  HRS § 706 -602 supp. Cmt. (2014).  
This appears to explain why the acronym is “PSI” instead of “PSD.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   ***  
 
7 
  At the continued sentencing hearing, the circuit court’s 
concerns focused on the following statements apparently made by 
Sanney to the probation officer:  
The defendant declined to provide a written statement but 
verbally reported that he pled no contest because he had a 
federal hold on him and his plea may change his deportation 
hold status.  He said he was drunk and “high” from 
marijuana on the day of the offense and he is “only guilty 
of having sex in public.”  The defendant reported he and 
the victim drank alcohol together with other people that 
morning and he consumed 12 shots of vodka and two marijuana 
joints and wanted to sleep.  He stated he and the victim 
walked to another area of the park to lay [sic] down and 
the victim eventually passed out.  The defendant reported 
he used his scissors to cut the crotch area of her shorts 
so he could put his mouth on her vagina and then “humped” 
the victim with his  clothes on.  The defendant said he was 
“turned on” due to the fact that he was having sex in 
public, in daylight, and other people saw what he was doing 
to the victim.    
. . . . 
The defendant reported that he attended the Veterans In 
Progress Program, US  Vets in Kapolei, Hawaii [sic], from 
September, 2009 [to] April, 2010.  He said that he was 
living on the street and felt tricked into going to live at 
the shelter because he only wanted somewhere to live but 
was not willing to participate in the substance  abuse 
program.  He stated that he was rebellious and he just 
“went through the motions” of the substance program and 
smoked marijuana immediately after his graduation ceremony.    
 
 Defense counsel argued at length that the PSI did not 
contain anything the court did not know prior to accepting the 
change of plea, but did not request that Sanney be given an 
opportunity to withdraw his plea if the court did not follow its 
sentencing inclination.   At the end of the sentencing hearing, 
the circuit court stated:  
 And this is the thing about I felt tricked [sic]. You 
weren’t willing to do the substance abuse but went through 
the motions and smoked marijuana immediately after 
graduation.  Tha t’s what this says.  Then I look at the 
four DUIs, which your attorney is right, we knew about the 
four DUIs.  But, I mean, they do count as opportunities to 
do something about the problem, and, apparently, you know, ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   ***  
 
8 
 that wasn’t enough.  So the Court looks  at that.  And, you 
know, it’s a little bit alarming to see a statement that 
the only -- apparently there’s a suggestion -- you said the 
only thing you did wrong was having sex in public and that 
it was a turn -on, which, I don’t know, it conflicts with 
what you’re saying today.  But you know, these are -- I 
disagree with [defense counsel].    
 
Instead of sentencing Sanney pursuant to the stated inclination 
of probation with eighteen months of imprisonment, the circuit 
court sentenced Sanney to ten years of imprisonment on both 
counts, with the terms to run concurrently.    
B.   Motion to reconsider sentence and the first appeal 
 
    Following the continued sentencing hearing, Sanney filed a 
motion to reconsider sentence.  The only relief requested was 
for the circuit court to sentence Sanney to probation with 
eighteen months of imprisonment pursuant to its original 
inclination; there was no request to withdraw the plea.  A 
hearing was scheduled, but it was continued after S anney’s 
attorney withdrew and substitute counsel was appointed.  Four 
days before the continued hearing date, however, the circuit 
court summarily denied Sanney’s motion without a hearing on the 
grounds that Sanney had not presented new evidence.    
     Sanney’s current counsel filed the first appeal in this 
case, challenging the circuit court’s summary denial of his 
motion to reconsider.  After the ICA affirmed in a summary 
disposition order,  State v. Sanney , CAAP-12-0000654, 2013 WL 
3776162 (App. July 8, 2013) (SDO), we accepted certiorari.  In a 
memorandum opinion, we held that under the facts of this case, ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   ***  
 
9 
 the circuit court abused its discretion in summarily denying the 
motion for reconsideration without a hearing, and remanded the 
case for a hearing on Sanney’s motion.  State v. Sanney , SCWC-
12-0000654, 2014 WL 3928249 (Haw. Aug. 12, 2014)(mem.). 
C.   Hearing on remand regarding Sanney’s motion to  
reconsider sentence 
  
     On remand, the circuit court held a hearing on Sanney’s 
motion to reconsider sentence.   Sanney’s attorney argued his 
client had changed his plea based on the court’s stated 
inclination.  He  insisted there was nothing significantly 
different between the information available at the change of 
plea hearing and the sentencing hearing.  Sanney himself stated 
that his former attorney had told him the circuit court 
insinuated that if he pled out, the court would “parole[] [him] 
to the Feds and [he] was reluctant to do that even then.”   There 
was no request to withdraw the plea. 
     The circuit court discussed information it did not have at 
the time of the original sentencing, including defendant’s 
statements to the probation officer summarized above.  The 
circuit court also provided Sanney with the opportunity to 
explain the statements that caused it concern.  Sanney’s 
responses, however, did not assuage the circuit court’s 
concerns.  The circuit court then ruled that “the sentence was a 
justifiable one based on the PSI and everything else that was ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   ***  
 
10 
 before [the court],” and denied  Sanney’s motion to reconsider 
sentence.    
D.  The current appeal and the ICA’s decision  
 Following the hearing, Sanney filed the current appeal.  
Before the ICA, Sanney argued the case should be remanded for 
resentencing in accordance with the circuit co urt’s original 
inclination.  In the alternative, Sanney requested the 
opportunity to withdraw his no contest plea, a request that had 
not been made before the circuit court.    
     In a summary disposition order, the ICA affirmed the 
circuit court’s denial of Sanney’s motion to reconsider, 
reasoning that Sanney stated at the change of plea hearing that 
he understood that the court’s inclination was not a promise.  
State v. Sanney , CAAP-15-0000548, 2016 WL 3548352 (App. June 28, 
2016) (SDO) at *2.  The ICA concluded, after consideration of 
the reasons iterated by the circuit court at sentencing, that 
the circuit court did not commit a plain and manifest abuse of 
discretion in denying Sanney’s motion.   The ICA did not address 
whether Sanney should have had the opportunity to withdraw his 
plea after the court declined to follow the sentencing 
inclination. 
E. Application for writ of certiorari and oral argument 
 In his application for certiorari, Sanney argues the 
circuit court abused its discretion in denying his motion to ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   ***  
 
11 
 reconsider sentence, and that this court should either order the 
circuit court to impose the sentence it had been inclined to 
impose before the change of plea, or allow him to withdraw his 
plea.  At oral argument, however, Sanney clarified that the only 
relief he seeks is for this court to order resentencing pursuant 
to the circuit court’s original sentencing inclination, as 
requested in the motion to reconsider filed in the circuit 
court.  State v. Sanney , SCWC-15- 0000548, Oral Argument, 
available at http://www.courts.state.hi.us./oral-argument-
before-the-hawaii-supreme -court-scwc-15-548, at 1:05:35.   
III.  Standard of Review  
 Sentencing decisions are reviewed under the abuse of 
discretion standard.  A sentencing judge generally has broad 
discretion in imposing a sentence.  Generally, to constitute an 
abuse of discretion, it must appear that the court clearly 
exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rule of principles 
of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party 
litigant.  State v. Hussein , 122 Hawai i 495, 503, 229 P.3d 313, 
321 (2010).  
IV. Discussion 
A. Sentencing Inclinations 
 
California refers to sentencing inclinations as “indicated 
sentences.”  In People v. Clancey , 56 Cal. 4th 562, 155 Cal. 
Rptr. 3d 485, 299 P.3d 131 (2013), the California Supreme Court ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   ***  
 
12 
 explained the differences between a plea bargain and a 
sentencing inclination: 
The process of plea bargaining which has received 
statutory and judicial authorization as an appropriate 
method of disposing of criminal prosecutions contemplates 
an agreement negotiated by the [State] and the defendant 
and approved by the court.  Pursuant to this procedure the 
defendant agrees to plead guilty in order to obtain a 
reciprocal benefit, generally consisting of a less severe 
punishment than that which could result if he were 
convicted of all offenses charged.  Judicial approval is an 
essential  condition precedent to the effectiveness of the 
bargain worked out by the defense and the prosecution. 
Because the charging function is entrusted to the 
executive, the court has no authority to substitute itself 
as the representative of the [State] in the  negotiation 
process and under the guise of plea bargaining to agree to 
a disposition of the case over prosecutorial objection.  
 
 On the other hand, where the defendant pleads guilty 
to all charges so all that remains is the pronouncement of 
judgment and sentencing, there is no requirement that the 
[State] consent to a guilty plea.  In that circumstance, 
the court may indicate what sentence it will impose if a 
given set of facts is confirmed, irrespective of whether 
guilt is adjudicated at trial or admitted by plea. 
 
56 Cal. 4th at 569- 70, 155 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 490, 299 P.3d at 135 
(internal punctuation and citations removed).   
 Thus, a plea bargain is an agreement between the executive 
branch5 and the defendant, which can include the reduction or 
dismissal of charges and/or agreements regarding sentencing.  
See Hawai i Rules of Penal Procedure (“HRPP”) Rule 11(f)(1) 
(2014).  Pursuant to this rule, a judge is able to participate 
                         
5  In Hawai‘ i, the executive branch is represented by the Attorney General 
or county Prosecuting Attorney offices.  
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   ***  
 
13 
 in negotiations leading to a plea agreement, and may agree to be 
bound.6  Id. 
 In Clancey, the California Supreme Court explained the role 
of the executive versus the court in sentencing proceedings: 
The charging function is the sole province of the 
executive.  The executive also decides whether to engage in 
negotiations with the defense by which a more lenient disposition 
of the charges can be secured without trial-- a bargain that must 
ultimately be approved by a court.   
. . . . 
The imposition of sentence within the legislatively 
determined limits, on the other hand, is exclusively a judicial 
function.  The refusal of prosecutors to consider plea bargaining 
as a viable alternative to a lengthy trial may militate against 
the efficient administration of justice, impose unnecessary costs 
upon taxpayers, and subject defendants to the harassment and 
trauma of avoidable trials.  A court may alleviate this burden 
upon our criminal justice system if this can be accomplished by 
means of a permissible exercise of judicial sentencing discretion 
in an appropriate case.  
 
Clancey, 56 Cal. 4th at 574, 155 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 493, 299 P.3d 
at 138 (internal citations and quotation marks removed).  
 The Clancey court also laid out appropriate procedures for 
trial judges regarding sentencing inclinations or “indicated 
sentences”:  
 First, in order to preserve the executive’s 
prerogative to conduct plea negotiations, a trial court 
                         
6  HRPP Rule 11(f)(1) provides:  
   
IN GENERAL.  The prosecutor and counsel for the defendant, or 
the defendant when acting pro se, may enter into plea 
agreements that, upon the entering of a plea of guilty or 
no contest to a charged offense or to an included or 
related offense, the prosecutor will take certain actions 
or adopt certain positions, including the dismissal of 
other charges and the recommending or not opposing of 
specific sentences or dispositions on the charge to which a 
plea was entered.  The court may participate in discussions 
leading to such plea agreements and may agree to be bound 
thereby. 
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   ***  
 
14 
 generally should refrain from announcing an indicated 
sentence while the parties are still negotiating a 
potential plea bargain. . . .  
 
 Second, a trial court should consider whether the 
existing record concerning the defendant and the 
defendant’s offense or offenses is adequate to make a 
reasoned and  informed judgment as to the appropriate 
penalty.  The utility of an indicated sentence necessarily 
depends on the quality of the information available to the 
court at an early stage concerning the offense and the 
defendant’s criminal history.  
 
 Third, a court may not offer any inducement in return 
for a plea of guilty or nolo contendere.  It may not treat 
a defendant more leniently because he foregoes his right to 
trial or more harshly because he exercises that right.  
Because an indicated sentence is merely an instance of 
sentencing discretion wisely and properly exercised, the 
indicated sentence must be the same punishment the court 
would be prepared to impose if the defendant were convicted 
at trial.  An indicated sentence, properly understood, is 
not an attempt to induce a plea by offering the defendant a 
more lenient sentence than what could be obtained through 
plea negotiations with the prosecuting authority.  When a 
trial court properly indicates a sentence, it has made no 
promise that the sentence will be imposed.  Rather, the 
court has merely disclosed to the parties at an early stage 
-- and to the extent possible --  what the court views, on 
the record then available, as the appropriate sentence so 
that each party may make an informed decision. . . .  
 
 Fourth, a trial court may not bargain with a 
defendant over the sentence to be imposed.  
 
56 Cal. 4th at 574- 75, 155 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 494, 299 P.3d at 
138-39 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted; emphasis 
in original).  
 We agree with the California Supreme Court’s well -reasoned 
approach to sentencing inclinations.  First, absent unusual 
circumstances, a trial court should not provide a sentencing 
inclination unless plea negotiations have concluded or did not 
occur.  Second, before giving a sentencing inclination, a trial 
court should consider whether the existing record concerning the ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   ***  
 
15 
 defendant and the defendant’s offense(s) is adequate to make a 
reasoned and informed judgment as to the appropriate penalty.   
Third, a trial court must follow the established “principle 
forbidding a trial court from improperly considering the 
defendant’s exercise of his constitutional right to a . . . 
trial as an influential factor in determining the appropriate 
sentence.”  State v. Kamanao , 103 Hawai i 315, 321 n.8, 82 P.3d 
401, 407 n.8 (2003) (citations omitted).  In other words, the 
sentencing inclination must be the same punishment the court 
would be prepared to impose if the defendant were convicted 
after trial.  Finally, a trial court may not bargain with the 
defendant over the sentence to be imposed, as a trial court’s 
sentencing inclination must be the same punishment the court 
would impose if the defendant were convicted following a trial.  
Bargaining over the sentence would contravene this requirement. 
B. The circuit court did not abuse its discretion by denying 
Sanney’s motion to reconsider pursuant to the original 
sentencing inclination, because a sentencing inclination is 
not binding, and certain facts became available after the 
court issued its sentencing inclination. 
 
 The guidance discussed above was not part of our law at the 
time of Sanney’s change of plea, sentencing, or reconsideration 
of sentence, so we analyze this appeal based on governing law at 
the times of the trial court’s decisions.  Sanney argues he 
should have been resentenced pursuant to the circuit court’s 
original inclination of probation with eighteen months of ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   ***  
 
16 
 imprisonment instead of the ten years of imprisonment actually 
imposed, because the court’s stated sentencing inclination 
influenced his decision to change his plea to no contest.  As 
noted, this was Sanney’s only reques t to the circuit court -- he 
did not request the opportunity to withdraw his plea.  
Therefore, the only issue before us is whether the circuit court 
abused its discretion when it denied Sanney’s motion to 
reconsider sentence and refused to resentence him p ursuant to 
its original sentencing inclination.  
 To constitute an abuse of discretion, “ it must appear that 
the court clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded 
rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial 
detriment of a party litiga nt.”  Hussein, 122 Hawai i at 503, 229 
P.3d at 321.  A sentencing inclination is not binding; it is 
merely a trial court’s statement of the sentence it would be 
inclined to impose for the offense(s) charged, should the 
defendant be convicted after trial.  Sanney argues that the 
information available at the pre-sentencing hearing and the 
sentencing hearing was  virtually identical.  As discussed above, 
however, the record clearly reflects that the circuit court 
changed its sentencing inclination based on Sann ey’s statements 
to the probation officer who was preparing the PSI.  These 
statements occurred after the change of plea, and comprise 
information not available to the circuit court at the time it ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   ***  
 
17 
 gave its sentencing inclination.  The circuit court’s 
postponement of the sentencing hearing so the probation officer 
could be present to clarify the PSI evidences the importance of 
these statements to the circuit court’s sentencing decision.    
At the hearing on the motion to reconsider sentence, the 
circuit court provided Sanney with the opportunity to explain 
his statements.  Sanney’s responses, however, did not assuage 
the circuit court’s concerns.   The circuit explained how 
information not available at the time it gave its original 
inclination caused it to change its sentencing inclination and  
to deny the motion to reconsider sentence.    
At the change of plea hearing, Sanney unequivocally stated 
that he understood the circuit court’s sentencing inclination 
was not binding.  The circuit court conducted a thorough change 
of plea colloquy before finding that Sanney had voluntarily and 
knowingly entered into the change of plea.  At the hearing on 
the motion to reconsider sentence, the circuit court explained 
that it had changed its sentencing inclination based on 
information in the PSI that was not available at the time of its 
original sentencing inclination.  Therefore, the circuit court 
did not abuse its discretion by refusing to resentence Sanney 
pursuant to its original sentencing inclination, and the ICA did 
not err in affirming the circuit court.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   ***

 C. Prospectively, a trial court must advise the defendant of a 
change in its sentencing inclination before imposing a 
sentence and provide the defendant with the choice of 
affirming or withdrawing the guilty or no contest plea. 
 Although we find no error in this case, we take this 
opportunity to further address the sentencing inclination 
process to provide a new rule for application to future cases.  
 The American Bar Association’s Criminal Justice Section 
historically provides guidance in the form of Standards Relating 
to Pleas of Guilty (“ABA Standards”).  ABA Standard 14 -2.1 
relates to “Plea withdrawal and specific performance,” and 
provides, in relevant part: 
(a) After entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere 
and before sentence, the court should allow the defendant 
to withdraw the plea for any fair and just reason.  In 
determining whether a fair and just reason exists, the 
court should also weigh any prejudice to the prosecution 
caused by reliance on the defenda nt’s plea. 
(b) After a defendant has been sentenced pursuant to a 
plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the court should allow 
the defendant to withdraw the plea whenever the defendant, 
upon a timely motion for withdrawal, proves that withdrawal 
is necessary to correct a manifest injustice .  A timely 
motion for withdrawal is one made with due diligence, 
considering the nature of the allegations therein.  
 
(i)  Withdrawal may be necessary to correct a manifest 
injustice when the defendant proves,  that: 
. . . . 
(E) the defendant did not receive the  charge or for example,
sentence  
concessions contemplated by the plea agreement, which was  
either tentatively  or fully concurred in by the court, and 
the defendant did not affirm the plea after being advised 
that the court no longer concurred and after being called 
upon to either affirm or withdraw the plea[.]   
 
(Emphases added.)  On its face, ABA Standard 14- 2.1(b)(i)(E) 
applies to plea bargain agreements and not to judge- only 
sentencing inclinations.  The ABA Standard applies, however, ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   ***  
 
19 
 even when a court has not agreed to be bound, but has merely 
indicated a tentative inclination to follow a plea agreement, 
including sentencing recommendations.  Stating a tentative 
inclination to follow the sentencing recommendations of a plea 
agreement is analogous to giving a sentencing inclination 
without a plea agreement.  Thus, the ABA Standard can be 
analogized to situations where a court changes its sentencing 
inclination. 
 Various states, including Hawai i, have adopted procedures 
identical to, or consistent with, the ABA Standard.  Relevant 
cases involve circumstances where a judge is no longer inclined 
to follow its original sentencing inclination, a defendant 
cannot as a matter of law be sentenced pursuant to a trial 
court’s originally stated sentencing inclination, or the law has 
changed to allow for a more lenient sentence.  In 1967, 
Wisconsin adopted the ABA Standard while it was still in the 
tentative draft stage.  See State v. Washington , 176 Wis. 2d 
205, 214, 500 N.W.2d 331, 335 (Wis. Ct. App. 1993) (noting that 
the Wisconsin Supreme Court “accepted the 1967 tentative draft 
of what is now the plea withdrawal standard, sec. 14- 2.1 of the 
American Bar Association’s (ABA) Standards for Criminal Justice 
(2d Ed. Supp. 1986)”).  In 1930, the Supreme Court of Illinois 
held that where defendants changed their plea based on a judge’s 
stated inclination offering a more lenient sentence than that ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   ***  
 
20 
 required by law, they should have been granted leave to withdraw 
their pleas.  People v. Moore , 342 Ill. 316, 320, 174 N.E. 386, 
387 (1930).  In Ex parte Otinger , 493 So.2d 1362 (Ala. 1986), 
the Supreme Court of Alabama held that where a trial judge 
cannot follow its initial indicated sentence, the defendant 
should be afforded the opportunity to withdraw his pleas.  493 
So.2d at 1364.  In Cripps v. State , 122 Nev. 764, 137 P.3d 1187 
(2006), the Nevada Supreme Court held that “when a judge does 
express an inclination to follow the parties’ sentencing 
recommendation, the defendant must be given an opportunity to 
withdraw the plea if the judge later reconsiders and concludes 
that a harsher sentence is warranted.”  122 Nev. at 771, 137 
P.3d at 1191-92.  The Supreme Court, Appellate Division, Second 
Department of New York held that “[w]here the court determines 
that it cannot sentence the defendant as indicated prior to 
acceptance of the plea, the proper procedure is to allow 
defendant the choice of either withdrawing his guilty plea or 
accepting a proper sentence[. ]”  People v. Grant , 471 N.Y.S. 2d 
325, 327 (1984) (internal citation omitted).  Finally, where a 
trial court granted defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty 
pleas to greater charges due to there being an inadequate 
factual basis for the pleas but denied the motion as to a lesser 
charge, a New Jersey appellate court held that a plea withdrawal 
is mandated “whenever the defendant’s exposure to prison time is ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   ***  
 
21 
 dramatically reduced from what it was when a defendant entered 
the plea.”  State v. Ashley , 443 N.J. Super. 10, 23, 126 A.3d 
1234, 1243 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2015), certif. denied , 224 
N.J. 526 (2016). 
This court has held that a motion to withdraw plea should 
be granted where a defendant entered a plea based on a 
sentencing inclination that is legally impossible.  See State v. 
Fogel, 95 Hawai ‘i 398, 405, 23 P.3d 733, 740 (2001).  (“[W]e hold 
that to correct manifest injustice, a defendant must be 
permitted . . . to withdraw a plea entered in reliance on a 
court’s representation or promise, which is statutorily 
incapable of being effectuated.”).  
States have also applied the concept of plea withdrawal in 
situations where a court has changed its mind after a defendant 
enters a plea in reliance on a court’s stated sentencing 
inclination.  For example, in People v. Cobbs , 443 Mich. 276, 
505 N.W. 2d 208 (1993), the Supreme Court of Michigan allowed 
the defendant the right to withdraw his plea after the court 
determined a harsher sentence was appropriate: 
The judge’s preliminary evaluation of the case does not 
bind the judge’s sentencing discretion, since additional facts 
may emerge during later proceedings, in the presentence report, 
through the allocution afforded to the prosecutor and the victim, 
or from other sources.  However, a defendant who pleads guilty or 
nolo contendere in reliance upon a judge’s preliminary evaluation 
with regard to an appropriate sentence has an absolute right to 
withdraw the plea if the judge later determines that the sentence 
must exceed the preliminary evaluation . 
 
443 Mich. at 283, 505 N.W.2d at 212 (emphasis added). ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   ***  
 
22 
  The District Court of Appeal of Florida, First District, 
iterated a similar standard:  
Where[,] as here[,] a nolo contendere or guilty plea is 
tendered in relianc e on the court’s expression of 
sentencing intentions, and the plea is accepted, the 
sentencing judge must grant the defendant a clear 
opportunity to withdraw the plea if the judge cannot in 
conscience impose the sentence indicated; but that is the 
limit of the trial court’s obligation.   
 
State ex rel. Wilhoit v. Wells , 356 So.2d 817, 824 (Fla. Dist. 
Ct. App. 1978) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted; 
brackets added).  The court reached this conclusion in part by 
considering the 1968 version of the ABA Standard, Pleas of 
Guilty.  Id . 
 New Jersey has, by rule, adopted a similar plea withdrawal 
standard.  New Jersey Rules of Court Rule 3:9 -3 titled “Plea 
Discussions; Agreements; Withdrawals” provides in part:  
The court may then indicate . . . the maximum sentence it 
would impose in the event the defendant enters a plea of 
guilty, assuming, however, . . . that the information in 
the presentence report at the time of sentence is as has 
been represented to the court at the time of the disclosure 
and supports its determination that the interests of 
justice would be served thereby . . . If at the time of 
sentencing the court determines that the interests of 
justice would not be served  . . . by imposing sentence in
accordance with the court’s previous indications of 
sentence, the court may vacate the plea or the defendant 
shall be permitted to withdraw the plea.   
 
N.J. Ct. R. 3:9- 3 (emphasis added).   
 Finally, in Clancey, the Supreme Court of California 
contemplated defendant’s request to adopt a rule “that when a 
trial court offers an indicated sentence, it must advise the 
defendant of the opportunity to withdraw the plea if the court ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   ***  
 
23 
 later decides not to impose the indicated sentence.”  Clancey, 
56 Cal. 4th at 583-84,  155 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 501, 299 P.3d at 
144-45.  The court ultimately declined “to resolve here which 
standard should govern the withdrawal of a plea after a trial 
court declines to impose the indicated sentence” because the 
trial court did not decline to follow its original inclination 
and the defendant did not seek to withdraw his plea.  56 Cal. 
4th at 584, 155 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 501- 02, 299 P.3d at 145.  The 
State of California acknowledged, however, the existence of 
California law permitting a guilty plea to be withdrawn for 
“good cause shown” would be given “a liberal construction . . . 
in the interest of promoting justice.”  Id.  
 Hawai i law regarding plea withdrawals is governed by HRPP 
Rule 32(d) (2012) and case law construing the rule.  The 
language in HRPP Rule 32(d) is similar to that in ABA Standard 
14-2.1 and provides:  
(d) Withdrawal of Plea.  A motion to withdraw a plea of 
guilty or of nolo contendere may be made before sentence is 
imposed or imposition of sentence is suspended; provided 
that, to correct manifest injustice the court, upon a 
party’s motion submitted no later than ten (10) days after 
imposition of sentence, shall set aside the judgment of 
conviction and permit the defendant to withdraw the plea. 
At any later time, a defendant seeking to withdraw a plea 
of guilty or nolo contendere may do so only by petition 
pursuant to Rule 40 of  these rules and the court shall not 
set aside such a plea unless doing so is necessary to 
correct manifest injustice.  
  
 State v. Jim , 58 Haw. 574, 574 P.2d 521 (1978), outlines 
the standards that govern based on whether a motion to withdraw ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   ***  
 
24 
 plea is made before or after sentencing.  These standards are 
similar to those reflected in the ABA Standard:  
A defendant does not have an absolute right to 
withdraw his guilty plea, and a motion for withdrawal of a 
guilty plea under [HRCP Rule 32(d)] . . . must therefore be 
determined under either of two established principles. 
Where the request is made after sentence has been imposed, 
the “manifest injustice” standard is to be applied. 
H.R.Cr.P. Rule 32(d) (now H.R.P.P. Rule 32(d)). . .  But 
where the motion is presented to the trial court before the
imposition of sentence, a more liberal approach is to be 
taken, and the motion should be granted if the defendant 
has presented a fair and just reason for his request and 
the State has not relied upon the guilty plea to its  
substantial prejudice.   What the manifest injustice rule 
seeks to avoid is an opportunity for the defendant to test 
the severity of sentence before finally committing himself 
to a guilty plea.  But the risk of prejudice to the State 
and to the efficient administration of criminal justice is 
much less apparent where the withdrawal is requested before 
final judicial action is taken on the defendant’s plea.  
 
Jim, 58 Haw. at 575-76, 574 P.2d at 522- 23 (internal citations, 
quotation marks, and footnote omitted) (emphasis added).  
Regarding post- sentencing plea withdrawal, when the higher 
“manifest injustice” standard governs, this court has held that 
a motion to withdraw plea should be granted when a court’s 
stated intention to allow a deferral for which he was not 
eligible induced the defendant to change his plea.  Fogel , 95 
Hawai‘i at 405, 23 P.3d at 740.  As iterated in Jim, a more 
liberal standard applies to pre- sentencing plea withdrawal.  
Jim, 58 Haw. at 575- 76, 574 P.2d at 522- 23.   
 Based on the principles contained within ABA Standard 14-
2.1, persuasive law from other jurisdictions that have addressed 
the issue, HRPP Rule 32(d), and our case law, we now adopt a new ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   ***  
 
25 
 rule in the sentencing inclination context, which will have 
prospective effect only.  See State v. Cabagbag , 127 Hawai i 302, 
315, 277 P.3d 1027, 1040 (2012) (holding that a new rule 
requiring eyewitness identification in certain circumstances 
would have a prospective effect only).   
The new rule is as follows:  if a defendant pleads guilty 
or no contest in response to a court’s sentencing inclination , 
but the court later decides not to follow the inclination, then 
the court must so advise the defendant and provide the defendant 
with the opportunity to affirm or withdraw the plea of guilty or 
no contest.7  
 Applying the first Jim requirement for pre- sentence plea 
withdrawal motions, “fair and just reasons” clearly exist when a 
defendant makes a pre- sentence request to withdraw plea, as the 
defendant’s change of plea was made in reliance on the court’s 
stated sentencing inclination.  Applying the second Jim 
requirement that “ the State has not relied upon the guilty plea 
to its substantial prejudice,” a defendant’s  guilty plea made in 
response to a court’s stated sentencing inclination would 
usually not affect the State.  In any event, the new rule will 
                         
7 A defendant should be allowed to affirm and persist in the plea despite 
knowing the court will no longer impose the sentencing inclination upon which 
the defendant relied.  If the defendant chooses this alternative, however, 
the court should conduct a colloquy on the record establishing the 
defendant’s knowing and voluntary decision to affirm his or her guilty or no -
contest plea despite the change in the court’s sentencing inclination.

 encourage trial judges to consider whether the existing record 
concerning the defendant and the defendant’s offense(s) is 
adequate to make a reasoned and informed judgment as to the 
appropriate penalty.  It will also curtail hearings on motions 
and appeals to address whether a trial court abused its 
discretion by not following its originally stated sentencing 
inclination.  This includes hearings regarding whether adequate 
reasons existed for the change in a trial court’s sentencing 
inclination.8  The new rule will also eliminate hearings and 
questions regarding whether a defendant truly understood the 
non-binding nature of a court’s sentencing inclination.  
Finally, the new rule will foster public confidence in the 
judicial system, as defendants will no longer question whether 
they were somehow misled into entering into a change of plea 
based on a judge’s stated s entencing inclination.
 
V. Conclusion  
 
The above -described procedures and new rule will provide 
guidance for future cases involving changes of plea based on a 
judge’s stated sentencing inclination.  In this case, however,  
 
                         
8 Many discussions regarding t he offenses charged and the defendant’s 
history occur off the record, in a judge’s chambers.  This makes it difficult 
to ascertain the information on which a court relied when determining a 
sentencing inclination.  This problem is compounded if the sentencing judge 
is not the same judge who gave the sentencing inclination and the information 
on which the inclination is based is not included in the record.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   ***
