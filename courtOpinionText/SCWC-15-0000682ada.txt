2 of a colloquy before the trial  court accepted the stipulation.  
Although we hold that the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) 
did not ultimately err in concluding that a colloquy was not 
required in the circumstances of this case, we provide guidance 
as to the proper allocation of authority between a defendant and 
defense counsel in light of statements by the ICA  regarding 
defense counsel’s authority to stipulate to an evidentiary 
matter based on “trial tactics and procedure. ”  We further hold 
that the ICA erred in its alternative holding, which  employed  a 
novel test for evaluating prejudice resulting from a trial 
court’s acceptance of a stipulation without a colloquy. 
I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
  On September 2, 
2014, the State filed a complaint in 
the District Court of the Second Circuit (district court) 
charging Marcia Wilson with operating a vehicle under the 
influence of an intoxicant (OVUII) in violation of Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 291E-61(a)(1)1 and 291E-61(b),2 as well 
                     
 1 HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) (2007) provides in full:  
(a) A person commits  the offense of operating a vehicle 
under the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates 
or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:  
(1) While under the influence of alcohol in an amount 
sufficient to impair the person ’s normal mental 
faculties or ability to care for the person and guard 
against casualty[.]  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
3 as refusal to submit to a breath, blood, or urine test in 
violation of HRS §§ 291E-153 and 291E- 68.4  A bench trial began 
on May 15, 2015, with the proceedings thereafter continued to 
July 15, 2015.5 
  The only witness that the State called  to testify was 
Officer Jun Hattori.   Prior to Officer Hattori taking the stand, 
the following exchange occurred: 
                                                                  
(. . . continued) 
 
 2 HRS § 291E -61(b) (2007 & Supp. 2014) establishes the penalties 
for committing the offense of OVUII and provides for enhanced penalties for 
repeat OVUII offenders.  
 3 At the time of the incident giving rise to this case, HRS §  291E-
15 (2007 & Supp. 2014) provided in full as follows:  
If a person under arrest refuses to submit to a breath, 
blood, or urine test, none shall be given, except as 
provided in  section 291E- 21.  Upon the law enforcement 
officer’ s determination that the person under arrest has 
refused to submit to a breath, blood, or urine test, if 
applicable, then a law enforcement officer shall:  
(1) Inform the person under arrest of the sanctions 
under section 291E- 41, 291E -65, or 291E-68; and 
(2) Ask the person if the person still refuses to 
submit to a breath, blood, or urine test, thereby 
subjecting the person to the procedures and sanctions 
under part III or  section 291E -65, as applicable;  
provided that if the law enforcement officer fails to 
comply with paragraphs (1) and (2), the person shall not be 
subject to the refusal sanctions under part III or IV.  
 4 At the time of Wilson’s offense, HRS §  291E-68 (Supp. 2014) 
provided in full: “Except as provided in section 291E -65, refusal to submit 
to a breath, blood, or urine test as required by part II is a petty 
misdemeanor.”  This provision was subsequently repealed in 2016.  See 2016 
Haw. Sess. Laws Act 17, § 2 at 21.  
 5 The Honorable Kelsey T. Kawano presided.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
4 [THE PROSECUTOR]: So, your Honor, after discussing this 
case with the Public Defender, at this time I believe we’re 
going to stipulate t o Officer Hattori’s training, that he 
followed the standards and guidelines and requirements of 
the [National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
(NHTSA)] Manual.   It was supervised by a NHTSA Certified 
Instructor.  
 Officer Hattori’s  qualified and certif ied to conduct 
the standard --standardized field sobriety tests and that he 
received specialized training in administering and grading 
all of the standard field sobriety tests.  
THE COURT: All right.  
[THE PROSECUTOR]: And just for the record, your Honor, whe n 
I call Officer Hattori, he’ll briefly tell the Court what 
training he has received.  
THE COURT: All right.  
The court did not engage in a colloquy with  Wilson before 
accepting this stipulation.  
  Officer Hattori  testified that o n August 8, 2014, 
around 11: 15 p.m., he initiated a traffic stop  of a vehicle 
driven by Wilson.  The officer stated that Wilson’s speech was 
slurred and mumbled and  her eyes were red .  Officer Hattori 
related that he asked Wilson  if she would participate in  a 
standardized field sobriety test  (SFST), and she agreed.  
  The officer testified that he then administered  the 
three tests that comprise the SFST: the horizontal gaze 
nystagmus  (HGN) test, the walk -and-turn test, and the one -legged 
stand test.   Officer Ha ttori testified that he observed  a total 
of thirteen  “validated clues” during th e SFST, which he said 
demonstrated that Wilson was impair ed.  These included six  clues 
on the HGN test, four on the walk -and-turn test, and three on ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
5 the one-legged stand test.   Based on her performance, Officer 
Hattori concluded that Wilson was “impaired to the point where 
it was unsafe for her to be operating a vehicle, ” and he 
therefore arrested Wilson for OVUII.   
 
 Officer Hattori testified that he  transported Wilson 
to the K
īhei Police Station after she was arrested, where he 
informed her of the implied consent law and gave her a form on 
which to indicate whether she would submit to a breath or blood 
alcohol test.6  Wilson declined to submit to any test and marked 
the box on the form indicating that she had refused.7   
 
 Following Officer Hattori’s testimony, the State 
rested its case-in- chief.  The defense called Joelle Lindly, 
Wilson’s coworker, who  was with Wilson on the night that she was 
arrested.  L indly testified that after their shifts ended, she 
                     
 6 The officer read Wilson the following from the implied consent 
form: 
1. Any person who operates a vehicle upon a public way, 
street, road or highway or on or in the waters of the State 
shall be deemed to have given consent to a test or tests 
for the purpose of determining alcohol concentration or 
drug content of the per son’s breath, blood, or urine as 
applicable.  
2. You may refuse to submit to a breath or blood test, or 
both, for the purpose of determining alcohol concentration 
and/or blood or urine test, or both, for the purpose of 
determining drug content.  
 7 Wilson initially marked the box indicating that she would submit 
to a breath alcohol test, but she then changed her mind and initialed and 
crossed out her first  mark. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
6 saw Wilson have one glass of wine at the bar and then leave to 
go home.   
  At the close of evidence, the court found Wilson 
guilty of both charges.   On the OVUII offense , the district 
court sentenced Wilson to 72 hours of community service, a $250 
fine, a substance abuse evaluation, and a fourteen-hour 
substance abuse rehabilitation program.  On the refusal charge, 
Wilson was sentenced to pay $180  in fines and fees.  The court 
entered judgment on the same day.  Wilson filed a timely n otice 
of appeal. 
II. ICA PROCEEDINGS 
  On appeal, Wilson argued that the district court erred 
by not engaging her in a colloquy before accepting the 
stipulation as to Officer Hattori’s qualifi cations.  Wilson 
contended that the stipulation was a waiver of her 
constitutional right to confrontation and that the district 
court was therefore required to determine whether the waiver was 
made knowingly and voluntarily. 
  
Wilson asserted that , under our precedents,  a trial 
court must engage in a colloquy with the defendant when the 
defendant waives a fundamental right-- here, the right to 
confront a witness-- to ensure that the waiver is being knowingly 
and voluntarily given.  (Citing Tachibana v. State, 79 Hawai i 
226, 900 P.2d 1293 (1995); State v. Murray,  116 Hawaii 3, 169 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
7 P.3d 955 (2007).)  Thus, she concluded that defense counsel’s 
tactical decisions and trial strategy 
are not relevant in 
applying “the underlying rule that fundamental constitutional 
rights may only be waived by the defendant,” and any cases that 
have suggested otherwise are no longer viable.  (Citing State v. 
Casey, 51 Haw. 99, 101, 451 P.2d 806, 808 (1969).)   
  The ICA  affirmed Wilson’s OVUII conviction  and held 
that the trial court was not required to engage in a colloquy 
with Wilson before accepting the stipulation regarding Officer 
Hattori’s qualifications.   State v. Wilson, 141 Hawai i 459, 467, 
413 P.3d 363, 371 (App. 2018).  Relying on State v. El’Ayache , 
62 Haw. 646, 618 P.2d 1142 (1980), the ICA reasoned that 
stipulations like the one in this case make the trial process 
more efficient and avoid “time -consuming and needless 
presentation of evidence on matters that are undisputed.”  
Wilson, 141 Hawai i at 467, 413 P.3d at 371.  If trial courts 
were required to engage in a colloquy for every stipulation, the 
ICA stated, then the trial process would be burdened.  Id.  
Additionally, the ICA 
asserted that if defendants were given 
veto power over every stipulation, such a process wo uld 
“interfere with the role of defense counsel to exercise 
appropriate judgment in trial tactics and procedure.”  Id. 
  Next, the ICA reasoned that , under this court’s 
decision in State v. Murray, a colloquy is required before a ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
8 court accepts an evidentiary stipulation only where the 
defendant stipulated to an essential element of the charged 
offense.  Id. (citing Murray, 116 Hawai ‘i  at 10-14, 169 P.3d at 
962-66).  The ICA explained that the stipulation regarding 
Officer Hattori’s qualifications did not constitute an essential 
element of OVUII, but instead it was a stipulation that is 
routinely agreed to by parties to avoid unnecessary consumption 
of time.  Id.  The ICA also appeared to conclude that , even if 
the lack of colloquy was in error, Wilson fail ed to establish 
sufficient prejudice from the mistake to warrant vacating her 
convictions, stating, “Wilson makes no showing that absent the 
stipulation, the State would have been unable to establish 
Officer Hattori’s qualifications to administer field sob riety 
tests.”   Id. 8
III.  STANDARD OF REVIEW 
  The validity of a defendant’s waiver of a 
constitutional right is a question of constitutional law.  State 
                     
 8 The ICA also reversed Wilson’s conviction for refusal pursuant to 
State v. Won, 137 Hawai ‘i 330, 372 P.3d 1065 (2015).  Wilson, 141 Hawai i  at 
466, 413 P.3d at 370.  In discussing Won’s applicability after the United 
States Supreme Court’s decision in Birchfield v. North Dakota, 136 S. Ct. 
2160 (2016), the ICA reasoned that “[i]f the Hawai i Supreme Court adopted the 
Birchfield analysis in interpreting Article I, Section 7 of the Hawai i 
Constitution, it would require overturning Won[.]”  Wilson, 141 Hawai i at 
466, 413 P.3d at 370.  However, the ICA stated that “[w]ithout additional 
guidance from the Hawai i Supreme Court, we cannot say that Birchfield  would 
alter the Hawai i Supreme Court’s analysis in Won.”  Id. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
9 v. Ui, 142 Hawai i 287, 292, 418 P.3d 628, 633 (2018).  “We 
answer questions of constitutional law by 
exercising our own 
independent constitutional judgment based on the facts of the 
case.  Thus, we review questions of constitutional law under the 
right/wrong standard.”  State v. Friedman
, 93 Hawaii 63, 67, 996 
P.2d 268, 272 (2000) (quoting State v. Hanapi , 89 Hawaii 177, 
182, 970 P.2d 485, 490 (1998)). 
IV. DISCUSSION 
  In her application for certiorari, Wilson argues that 
the ICA erred in concluding that the district court was not 
required to engage in a colloquy with her before accepting the 
stipulation regarding Officer Hattori’s qualifications.   She 
reasons that the right to confrontation is a fundamental right 
that cannot be waived by a defendant absent a colloquy with the 
trial court.  Wilson 
argues that the defense counsel’s 
stipulation effectively waived her ability to confront the 
officer as to whether he was properly trained and qualified to 
conduct the SFST, and that 
the ICA erred by holding that such a 
waiver may be made by defense counsel on a defendant’s behalf as 
a matter of trial strategy.   
  We thus begin by considering the role of defense 
counsel in relation to a client when making tactical choices 
regarding the course of litigation.  We then turn to the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
10 colloquy requirement as it relates to evidentiary stipulations 
before examining the showing of prejudice required to warrant 
vacating a conviction when a trial court fails to engage a 
defendant in a required colloquy. 
A. The Role of Defense Counsel  
  
In reaching its holding that the district court was 
not required to engage Wilson in a colloquy prior to accepting 
her stipulation, the ICA reasoned that “ to give the defendant 
veto power over every stipulation agreed to by his or her 
counsel[] would burden the trial process and interfere with the 
role of defense counsel to exercise appropriate judgment in 
trial tactics and procedure .”  State v. Wilson
, 141 Hawai ‘i 459, 
467, 413 P.3d 363, 371 (App. 2018).  In light of  this statement, 
we provide guidance as to the appropriate allocation of 
authority between a defendant and defense counsel.   
  Any  suggestion that stipulations involving tactics or 
procedure are the exclusive province of defense counsel in which 
a defendant plays little or no meaningful role  is at odds with 
both the professional rules promulgated by this court and 
accepted best practices within the legal profession more 
generally. 
  The Hawai‘i Rules
 of Professional Conduct (HRPC) 
repeatedly stress the importance of defense counsel’s  duty to 
consult with the defendant regarding strategic  decisions at ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
11 trial.  HRPC Rule 1.2(a) (2014)  states that defense counsel 
“shall abide by a client’s decisions concerning the objectives 
of representation[] and .  . . shall consult with the client as 
to the means by which the objectives are to be pursued.”  
(Emphases added.)  This responsibility is reiterated by HRPC 
Rule 1.4(a)(2), which states that attorneys are required to 
“reasonably consult with the client about the mea ns by which the 
client’s objectives are to be accomplished.”    9
  The  American Bar Association ’s (ABA) standards for 
criminal defense provide similar guidance.  Under the ABA 
standards, “
[s]trategic and tactical decisions should be made by 
defense counsel[] after consultation with the [defendant]
 where 
feasible and appropriate.”   ABA, Criminal Justice Standards for 10
                     
 9 In addition to our professional rules, the duty of defense 
counsel to consult with a defendant regarding trial strategy may inhere in 
the right to counsel guaranteed by Article I, section 14 of the Hawai ‘i 
Constitution and the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  See  
Frazer v. South Carolina, 430 F.3d 696, 707  (4th Cir. 2005)  (reasoning that 
the Sixth Amendment requires counsel to consult with a client on important 
strategic decisions).  
 10 The commentary to the 1993 version of the standard, which 
contained identical wording, indicates the “where feasible and appropriate” 
language is an acknowledgement that some strategic and tactical decisions 
must be made “in circumstances that do not allow extended, if any, 
consultation.”  ABA Standards for Criminal Justice : Prosecution Function and 
Defense Function, Standard 4 -5.2 Commentary, at 200, 202  (3d ed. 1993).  The 
included history of the provision further clarifies that the language “was 
added . . . to reflect the fact that sometimes consultation is virtually 
impossible, e.g., in the middle of cross -examination .”  Id. Standard 4 -5.2 
History of Standard, at 200.  Although a 2015 update of the standards has 
been published, commentary accompanying the standards has yet to be released 
as of the date of this opinion.  See  ABA, Criminal Justice Standards for the 
Defense Function - Table of Contents, https://perma.cc/7TPY -ZDGU. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
12 the Defense Function, Standard 4 -5.2(d) (4th ed. 2015) (emphase s 
added).  Such strategic decisions include “ how to pursue plea 
negotiations, how to craft and respond to motions and, at 
hearing or trial, what witnesses to call, whether and how to 
conduct cross-examination, what jurors to accept or strike, what 
motions and objections should be made, what stipulations if any 
[to agree to,] and what and how evidence should be introduced. ”  
Id. (emphase s added).   The commentary to the ABA standards notes 
that some tactical decisions “can be anticipated sufficiently so 
that counsel can ordinarily consult with the client concerning 
them.”  ABA Standards for Criminal Justice: Prosecution Function  
and Defense Function, Standard 4-5.2 Commentary , at 202 (3d ed. 
1993).   11
  Consultation with the defendant serves many  purposes: 
first, it protects the defendant’s right to have the opportunity 
to participate in the defense; second, it allows defense counsel 
to hear the defendant’s views and desires regarding the best 
course of action, which “are relevant considerations that must 
                     
 11 Although the 2015 ABA Standards list the decision of whether to 
agree to stipulations as an example of a strategic decision to be ultimately 
made by defense counsel, the standards also make clear that “the decisions 
ultimately to be made by a competent client, after full consultation with 
defense counsel, include . . . any [] decision that has been determined in 
the jurisdiction to belong to the client.”  ABA, Criminal Justice Standards 
for the Defense Function, Standard 4 -5.2(b)(ix).  As discussed infra, Section 
IV.B, this court has held that some stipulations may affect a defendant’s 
fundamental rights and that the final decision to enter into such a 
stipulation rests with the defendant.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
13 be evaluated and taken into account by counsel”; third, it 
“promote[s] and maintain[s ] a cooperative client- counsel 
relationship”; and fourth, if there is a difference in opinion 
between the defendant and defense counsel, it affords the 
defendant the opportunity to seek different representation.  
Gov’t of Virgin Islands v. Weatherwax , 77 F.3d 1425, 1436-37 (3d 
Cir. 1996).  Consultation with the defendant also helps defense 
counsel in the representation of the client because “[t]he 
process of thinking through alternative courses of action and 
explaining them to a client encourages self-scrutiny and fosters 
greater self-awareness of the factors influencing the lawyer’s 
judgment, thereby improving [ the lawyer’s] decisionmaking.”  
Mark Spiegel, Lawyering and Client Decisionmaking: Informed 
Consent and the Legal Profession, 128 U. Pa. L. Rev. 41, 104  
(1979).  Additionally, an informational imbalance occurs when 
defense counsel does not
 consult with the defendant.   “While an 
attorney’s education and experience give [the attorney] superior 
knowledge of generalized technical information, ‘[t]he clien t 
possesses superior knowledge of another sort--knowledge of the 
facts and circumstances of his case.’”  Stano v. Dugger, 921 
F.2d 1125, 1146 n.33 (11th Cir. 1991) (quoting Spiegel, supra , 
at 100) (alteration in original).  Further, although the 
attorney will generally have more legal expertise, “the client[ 
has] superior knowledge of her own values,”  which potentially ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
14 makes the client “more competent[] than the lawyer” with respect 
to the goals of litigation.  Spiege l, supra , at 108-09. 
  Several state courts have also determined that defense 
counsel must consult with a defendant before making certain 
decisions that may be classified as “strategic” or “tactical .”  
The Supreme Court of Delaware evaluated this issue when the 
defense counsel agreed to a supplemental jury charge without 
consulting with the defendant.  Bradshaw v. State, 806 A.2d 131, 
134 (Del. 2002).  In Bradshaw, during jury deliberations, the 
judge convened with counsel 
to notify them that the jury was 
unable to make a decision.  Id.  at 133-34.  After a brief search 
for the defendant at the courthouse was unsuccessful , the 
defense counsel agreed that the court would give the jury an 
Allen charge, which is  “a request from a trial court to the jury 
to attempt to come to a decision in the case without abandoning 
any firmly held beliefs. ”  Id. at 134 (citing Holland v. State, 
744 A.2d 980, 981– 82 (Del.  2000) (citing Allen v. United States, 
164 U.S. 492, 501 (1896))). 
  The Delaware Supreme Court held that the defendant’s 
counsel had no authority to agree to an Allen charge in the 
absence of the defendant.  Id.  at 137.  Although the court 
ultimately held that defendants have the fundamental right to be 
present at trial that 
“is personal to a defendant [] and may not 
be waived by that defendant’s counse l,” the court noted that ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
15 counsel could not have made the decision unilaterally even if 
this were not the case.  Id.  Under the Delaware Lawyers’ Rules 
of Professional Conduct, the court reasoned, “a  lawyer has a 
duty to reasonably consult with his or her client even as to 
trial tactics.”  Id. at 138 (citing Delaware Lawyer’s Rules of 
Professional Conduct Rule 1.2).  
  Kansas has likewise held that defense counsel does not 
have unlimited authority in making tactical decisions.  In State 
v. Nixon, on the morning that the trial judge was scheduled to 
render a verdict in the defendant’s bench trial, the judge met 
in chambers with the defense counsel and the prosecutor to tell 
them that he overheard someone say that the defendant failed a 
lie detector test.  576 P.2d 691 , 697 (Kan. 1978).  The judge 
then said, “If defense counsel thinks that has prejudiced this 
Court, I’ll declare a mistrial.  Do you want a little time to 
think about it?”  Id.  The defense counsel responded , “I’m quite 
sure it played no part in your decision, and I would see no 
reason for the Court not to go right ahead.”  Id.  The court 
then proceeded to convict the defendant on two of the three 
charged offenses.  Id. at 692- 93. 
  The Kansas Supreme Court vacated the defendant’s 
convictions.  Id. at 697 -98.  Although the court acknowledged 
that the statements “played no part in [the judge’s] decision,” 
it stated that  “before waiving defendant’s right to a mistrial ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
16 volunteered by the trial court, defendant should have been 
consulted by counsel and given an opportunity to consider the 
alternatives.”  Id.  The court held that, regardless of whether 
defense counsel’s decision “could very well be [classified] 
as a 
matter of trial strategy,” the defendant was still required to 
be consulted.  Id.  This is because, as the Nixon court stated, 
even those 
“strategic and tactical decisions” that are the 
“province of the lawyer ” are to be made only  “after consultation 
with [the lawyer’s] client.”  Id. (citing ABA Standards for 
Criminal Justice: Defense Function, § 5.2) (emphasis added)).   
Thus, the Kansas Supreme Court held that a defense counsel 
cannot reject a mistrial when offered by the trial court without 
consulting with the defendant.  Id. 
  T hese authorities demonstrate that strategic decisions  
at trial are not solely within the province of defense counsel’s 
“appropriate judgment.”   Certainly defense counsel is 
responsible for develop
ing a trial strategy, but in doing so 
“defense counsel undoubtedly has a duty to discuss potential 
strategies with the defendant. ”  Florida v. Nixon , 543 U.S. 175, 
178 (2004).  This duty of course includes consulting with the 
defendant regarding those evidentiary stipulations that we have 
held necessitate a colloquy because they constitute waivers of 
fundamental rights.  See  infra Section IV .B.  But an attorney’s 
duty to consult with a client extends far beyond these limited ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
17 circumstances for, as we have held, “ every decision t o stipulate 
to evidence in a case may be considered within the bounds of . . 
. trial strategy.”  State v. Ui, 142 Hawai i 287, 295, 418 P.3d 
628, 636 (2018). 
  Even when a stipulation does not implicate fundamental 
rights, it may establish a substantive fact that could weigh on 
the outcome of the case.  It would be against the great weight 
of authority for a defense counsel not to consult  with the 
defendant on a decision with such implications.  See  HRPC Rules 
1.2(a), 1.4(a)(2); ABA, Criminal Justice Standards for the 
Defense Function, Standard 4
-5.2(d).  Insofar as the  ICA’s 
statement could be interpreted to suggest that defense counsel 
has unilateral authority to determine matters of “tactics and 
procedure” without consultation with the defendant, we now 
clarify that defense counsel has a duty to consult with the 
defendant before making 
strategic decisions when it is feasible 
and appropriate to do so, including before entering into an 
 evidentiary stipulation.  
B. The Colloquy Requirement 
  “It is well settled in Hawai i law that a defendant 
relinquishes fundamental rights only when a waiver is undertaken 
intelligently, knowingly, and voluntarily.”  Ui, 142 Hawai i at 
293, 418 P.3d at 634 (citing State v. Murray, 116 Hawai i 3, 10-***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
18 11, 169 P.3d 955, 962-63 (2007)).  Before accepting the waiver 
of a fundamental right, a trial court must engage in an on-the-
record colloquy with the defendant.  Id.   This court has 
determined that the right to counsel, Carvalho v. Olim, 55 Haw. 
336, 342-43, 519 P.2d 892, 897 (1974), the right to trial by 
jury, State v. Ibuos, 75 Haw. 118, 121, 857 P.2d 576, 578 
(1993), and the right of a defendant to testify, 
Tachibana v. 
State, 79 Hawai i 226, 236, 900 P.2d 1293, 1303 (1995), are 
fundamental rights that require an 
on-the-record colloquy with 
the defendant before a trial court can accept a waiver.   
  A s the ICA recognized, a trial court must also engage 
in a colloquy with a defendant before it accepts a stipulation 
to an element of a charged offense  because this amo unts to a 
waiver of the fundamental due process right to have all elements 
of an offense proven beyond a reasonable doubt.   Murray, 116 
Hawai
i at 12, 169 P.3d at 964.  In State v. Ui , which involv ed 
defense counsel’s stipulation to facts that had the effect of 
establishing an element of the charged offense, we expressly 
rejected a “trial strategy” exception to the colloquy 
requirement, reasoning that such an exception would “ultimately 
swallow the colloquy rule” because “every decision to stipu late 12
                     
 12 Article I, section 5 of the Hawai‘i Constitution states in 
relevant part, “No person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property 
without due process of law.”  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
19 to evidence in a case may be considered within the bounds of [a] 
trial strategy exception.”  142 Hawai i at 295, 418 P.3d at 636;  
see also Tachibana, 79 Hawai i at 232, 900 P.2d at 1299 ( “[A] 
defendant’s personal constitutional right to testify truthfully 
in his [or her] own behalf may not be waived by counsel as a 
matter of trial strategy. ” (quoting United States v. Moody, 977 
F.2d 1425, 1431 (11th Cir. 1992)) ( second alteration in 
original)).  Thus, Ui  reaffirmed the long- standing principle  
that a colloquy is required when a stipulation “goes beyond the 
bounds of trial tactics and procedure, and impinges 
significantly on constitutionally guaranteed right .”  State v. 
Casey, 51 Haw. 99, 101, 451 P.2d 806, 808–09 (1969) .  In such 
instances, the waiver “must be the personal action of the 
beneficiary of right” --and not of counsel.  Id.  
  Wilson argues that the stipulation was not a waiver of 
the right to have every element of an offense proven beyond a 
reasonable doubt but rather of a different fundamental right--
her right to confront witnesses against her.13  To be sure, we 
have held that some evidentiary stipulations may so inherently 
implica
te a defendant’s confrontation rights as to require a 
                     
 13 Article I, section 14 of the Hawai‘i Constitution states in 
relevant part, “In all criminal prosecutions, the accused sh all enjoy the 
right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses against the accused.”  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
20 colloquy to confirm the defendant has knowingly, voluntarily, 
and intelligently acquiesced in the decision.   
  In State v. Casey, for instance, a husband and wife 
that were represented by the same counsel were charged 
separately with the same offense, and their cases were 
consolidated for a bench trial.  51 Haw. at 100, 451 P.2d at  
808.  The wife failed to appear on the morning of the trial, and 
the court proceeded to try the husband alone, concluding shortly 
before noon.  Id.  When the wife then appeared that afternoon, 
defense counsel stipulated that all of the evidence presented by 
both the defense and prosecution during the husband’s trial 
would be the same evidence presented during the wife’s trial if 
it were to proceed.  Id.   The court accepted the stipulation 
without engaging the wife in a colloquy and proceeded to find 
both the husband and wife guilty.  Id.  As with a stipulation to 
facts establishing an element of an offense in Ui , this court 
held on review that the stipulation went beyond the bounds of 
mere trial tactics and strategy to  impinge on the wife’s 
constitutional right to confrontation,  and a colloquy was 
therefore required.  Id.  at 102, 451 P.2d at 809. 
  The ICA’s opinion here stated that stipulations like 
the one in this case “serve to make the trial process more 
efficient by avoiding time- consuming and needless presentation 
of evidence on matters that are undisputed.”  Wilson, 141 Hawai‘i ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
21 at 467, 413 P.3d at 371.  And, as related, the ICA reasoned that 
“giv[ing] the defendant veto power over every stipulation agreed 
to by his or her counsel[] would burden the trial process and 
interfere with the role of defense counsel to exercise 
appropriate judgment in trial tactics and procedure.”  Id.  
Under Ui  and Casey, the determination of whether a stipulation 
relates to “trial strategy or tactics” is irrelevant when the 
stipulation sufficiently infringes on a defendant’s 
constitutional rights, and we now hold that efficiency and the 
perceived “burden” on the trial process are similarly 
immaterial.   
  Nevertheless, the stipulation in this case did not 
establish facts satisfying any elements  of the charged offense.  
To convict Wilson of OVUII, the State was required to prove that 
she operated a vehicle “while under the influence of alcohol in 
an amount sufficient to impair [her] normal mental faculties or 
ability to care for [herself] and guard against casualty.”  HRS 
§ 291E-61(a)(1).  Stipulating that the officer wa s “qualified 
and certified to conduct the [SFST] and that he received 
specialized training in administering and grading all of the 
[SFSTs]” is not in itself proof that Wilson was operating a 
vehicle or that she was impaired.  Thus, the stipulation in this 
case did not amount to a waiver of Wilson’s fundamental right to ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
22 have every element of a charged offense proven beyond a 
reasonable doubt.   
  Neither did the stipulation significantly impinge on 
Wilson’s confrontation rights.  Unlike the evidentiary 
stipulation at issue in Casey, the stipulation in this case did 
not serve as a substitute for evidence from which a factfinder 
could conclude that any element of the charged offenses was 
satisfied in whole or in part.  Instead, this stipulation was  to 
an evidentiary foundation involving the qualifications of a 
witness.   Under the circumstances, we cannot say that the 
stipulation so infringed upon Wilson’s right to confront Officer 
Hattori that a colloquy was required.   14
  T he ICA thus correctly concluded that the district 
court did not err in failing to engage in a colloquy with Wilson 
before accepting the stipulation as to Officer Hattori’s 
qualifications.   Wilson, 141 Hawai i at 467, 413 P.3d at 371.
 15
                     
 14 The fact that the stipulation was solely to an evidentiary 
foundation is not dispositive.  Evidentiary foundations can greatly differ in 
importance from case to case, and stipulating to certain foundational facts 
in a case may implicate a defendant’s fundamental rights.  A trial court 
would likely need to engage the defendant in a colloquy prior to accepting a 
stipulation to the accuracy of a DNA test indicating the defendant was the 
party responsible for a crime, for example.  
 15 In reaching its conclusions, the ICA relied in part on State v. 
El’Ayache, 62 Haw. 646, 647, 618 P.2d 1142, 1143 (1980), in which defense 
counsel stipulated that if called to the stand, two potential witnesses would 
testify that they had observed the defendant put items of clothing in a 
handbag and leave their employer’s store without paying for the i tems.  
Wilson, 141 Hawai‘ i at 467, 413 P.3d at 371.  The El’Ayache court concluded 
that the trial court did not err in admitting the stipulation without 
 
(continued . . .)  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
23 C. Determining Prejudice 
  Althou gh the ICA correctly held that a colloquy was 
not required in this case, the ICA appears to have set forth an 
alternative holding that established a new test for evaluating 
whether the lack of a required colloquy 
sufficiently prejudiced 
a defendant to warrant vacating a conviction.  After a brief 
discussion of Murray, the ICA stated, “Wilson makes no showing 
that absent the stipulation, the State would have been unable to 
establish Officer Hattori’s qualifications to administer field 
sobriety tests. ”  Wilson, 141 Hawai i at 467, 413 P.3d at 371.  
Thus, the ICA decision suggests that when a trial court errs  by 
failing to conduct a required colloquy prior to accepting an 
evidentiary stipulation, the error  will not justify a new trial 
unless the defendant can demonstrate that the State would have 
been unable to establish the substance of the stipulation 
through other evidence. 
                                                                  
(. . . continued) 
 
conducting a colloquy because the defendant’s right to confrontation “may, in 
appropriate cases, bow to  accommodate other legitimate interests in the 
criminal trial process” such as “the right of defense counsel to make an 
appropriate judgment on the trial tactics and procedure.”  62 Haw. at 649, 
618 P.2d at 1144.  The stipulation in El’Ayache  was to the testimony of the 
witnesses that would establish the elements of the charged offense.  The 
reasoning of El’Ayache  is thus questionable in light of our prior holding in 
Casey that a colloquy is required when a stipulation significantly impinges 
upon a defendant’s fundamental right to confront witnesses .  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
24   Our law is well -established that the failure of a 
trial court to deliver a constitutionally required colloquy is 
evaluated under the harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard, 
under which appellate 
courts must determine “whether there is a 
reasonable possibility that error might have contributed to 
[the] conviction.”  State v. Eduwensuyi, 141 Hawai
i 328, 336, 
409 P.3d 732, 740 (2018) (quoting State v. Han, 130 Hawaii 83, 
93, 306 P.3d 128, 138 (2013)).  If such a reasonable possibility 
exists, then “the judgment of conviction on which it may have 
been based must be set aside.”  State v. Gano, 92 Hawai i 161, 
176, 988 P.2d 1153, 1168 (1999) (quoting State v. Pulse, 83 
Hawaii 229, 248, 925 P.2d 797, 816 (1996)).  And in making this 
evaluation, the burden is not on the defendant to prove that the 
error could have affected the outcome of the case but rather on 
the State to prove that it could not have.  See  State v. Chin, 
135 Hawai‘ i 437, 449, 353 P.3d 979, 991 (2015) (“[T]here was no 
showing by the State that such misconduct was harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt.”); Han, 130 Hawai‘ i at 93, 306 P.3d at  138 
(“[T]hus the burden rests on the State to establish ‘the 
violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.’” (quoting 
Tachibana, 79 Hawai ‘i at 240, 900 P.2d at 1307)). 
  Rather than consider whether the State has 
demonstrated that the stipulation could not  have affected the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
25 outcome of the case, the ICA’s test appears to evaluate whether 
the defendant has established that the 
State would have been 
unable to prove the stipulated fact
 that was erroneously 
accepted by the court.   This novel approach would im permissibly 
shift the burden of demonstrating prejudice onto the defendant, 
and it is inconsistent with our case law.  W e thus hold that the 
ICA’s newly-created test  should not be employed in any instance 
in which a trial court has failed to engage the defendant in a 
required colloquy.16 
V. CONCLUSION 
  Based on the foregoing,  the ICA’s February 28, 2018, 
Judgment on Appeal and the district court’s  August 27 , 2015, 
                     
 16 Although the issue was not raised in Wilson’s application, we 
note that in reversing  Wilson’s conviction for refusal pursuant to State v. 
Won, 137 Hawaii 330, 3 72 P.3d 1065 (2015), the ICA expressed doubt about 
Won’s continued validity in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in 
Birchfield v. North Dakota, 136 S. Ct. 2160 (2016).  See Wilson, 141 Hawaii 
at 465-6 6, 413 P.3d at 369 -70.  In Birchfield , the U.S. Supreme Court held 
that “the Fourth Amendment  [to the United States Constitution] permits 
warrantless breath tests incident to arrests.”  136 S. Ct. at 2184 (emphasis 
added).  As the ICA recognized , “the Hawaii Supreme Court is free to give 
broader protection under the 
Hawaii Constitution than given by the United 
States Constitution.”  Wilson, 141 Hawai i at 466 , 413 P.3d at 370.  This 
court clearly did so in  Won, in which we held that the search incident to 
arrest exception to the warrant requirement is inapplicable to intoxilyzer 
tests under the Hawai ‘i Constitution.  See Won, 137 Hawai i at 339 n.23, 372 
P.3d at 1074 n.23.  Birchfield  did not undermine this conclusion, which was 
predicated on
 long-standing principles regarding the parameters of the search 
incident to arrest exception under the Hawai ‘i Constitution.  See id. at 353 
n.45, 372 P.3d at 1088 n.45  (citing State v. Kaluna, 55 Haw. 361, 367, 369 -
70, 520 P.2d 51, 57
–59 (1974) ).  The ICA’s uncertainty regarding Won was thus 
unwarranted. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

forth in this opinion.
