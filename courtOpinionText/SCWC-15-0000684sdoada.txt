(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Na kayama, McKenna, and Wilson, JJ., and 
Circuit Judge Kuriyama, in place of Pollack, J.,  recused)  
 
I.  INTRODUCTION  
 This case arises from a dispute over the sale of a 
used 2009 Shelby Cobra GT500KR, a limited edition of an exotic 
Ford Mustang sports car (“V ehicle”) , by Respondent/ Defendant -
Appellee /Cross-Appellant  Honolulu Ford, Inc.1 (“HFI”).  Following 
                     
1  HFI asserts in its response to Buyers’ application for writ of 
certiorari that “the Defendant/Appellee/Cross -Appellant in this case is a 
dissolved ent ity and no longer a going concern” and therefore “it is unclear 
what relief, if any, could be afforded by further review.”  Despite HFI’s 
contention that this case  is “no longer a going concern[,]” Buyers are

2 negotiations and the execution of two purchase agreements, 
Petitioners/ Plaintiffs -Appellants /Cross-Appellees  Joy P. Leong 
and Stephen B. Lindsey III (“Buyer s”) took possession of the 
Vehicle.  Although Buyers had raised concerns about the 
Vehicle’s clutch during the test drives, it was not until Buyers 
had the opportunity to drive the Vehicle home that they 
concluded some aspect of the clutch assembly was def ective.  
Buyers returned the Vehicle to HFI after driving it for forty-
seven miles and asked HFI to repair the clutch free of charge.  
HFI refused to repair the Vehicle at no cost to Buyers and, 
following rescission of the purchase agreement, refused to 
return Buyers’ $1 ,000.00 deposit because HFI claimed Buyers 
caused the Vehicle to have a “burnt clutch.”

  Statutes permitting suit against “dissolved” corporation s 
(“survival statutes”) generally permit individuals or entities to recover 
from dissolved corporations.  36 A.L.R.  7th Art. 4 (2018).  Hawai‘i’s survival 
statute is no exception.  Hawai‘i Revised Statutes (“ HRS”) § 634-61 (1972) 
provides:   
 
The death of a plaintiff or defendant or the 
dissolution of a corp orate plaintiff or defendant 
shall not cause an action to abate, but it may be 
continued upon substitution of the proper parties as 
provided by the rules of court, or if the claim is

parties the action shall p roceed in favor of or

3   Buyers asserted numerous claims alleging that HFI had 
engaged in unfair or deceptive acts or practices (“UDAP”) when 
it sold Buyers the Vehicle .  Buyer s seek review  of the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals ’ (“ICA”) affirmance  of the 
District Court of the First Circuit ’s (“district court”) Order 
Granting Defendant HFI’s Motion for Summary Judgment2 entered on 
March 24, 2015 (“Summary Judgment  Order”) and the Judgment3 
entered on August 25, 2015 against Buyers on all remaining 
claims. 
  Among other claims, Buyers argue that HFI was 
statutorily required to provide a warranty for the clutch 
assembly in the Vehicle, but refused to do so , and instead,  
misrepresent ed the nature of the damage that was found on  the 
Vehicle.  Following the rescission of the sales agreement, 
Buyers allege that HFI improperly retained Buyers’ $1 ,000.00 
deposit by claiming that Buyers destroyed the Vehicle’s clutch 
assembly by driving the Vehicle for forty-seven miles.   
On certiorari,  Buyers raise three main issues :  
(1) whether the ICA was correct in ruling that summary judgment 
was appropriately granted against Buyers’ claim that HFI

judgment  hearing and entered the Summary Judgment Order.

(continued . . .)  violated HRS § 480 -2 (2002), which prohibits unfair or  deceptive 
trade practice s, by increasing the contract price by $1 ,800.47 
above the price that had been negotiated ; (2) whether the ICA 
was correct in finding that HFI was entitled to retain the  
$1,000.00 deposit to offset its costs in repairing the clutch ; 
and (3) whether HFI was statutorily required to repair the 
Vehicle at no cost to Buyers.  
The district court erroneously interpreted  
HRS § 481J-2 (2008)4 to conclude  that the warranty  for used motor 
vehicles  in HRS § 481J-2 does not cover a clutch assem bly.  The 
                     
4  HRS § 481J -2 (2008) provides in relevant part:  
 
Used motor vehicles:  written warranty required, terms.  
(a) No used motor vehicle shall be sold in this State by a 
dealer to a consumer unless accompani ed by a written 
warranty covering the full cost of both parts and labor 
necessary to repair any defect or malfunction in a part 
covered under subsection (c) that impairs the used motor 
vehicle’s safety or use.   Defects and malfunctions that 
affect only app earance shall not be deemed to impair safety 
or use for the purposes of this chapter.  
 
. . . . 
 
(c) The written warranty shall require the dealer or its 
agent to repair or, at the election of the dealer, 
reimburse the consumer for the reasonable costs of 
repairing the failure of a covered part.  Covered parts 
shall at least include the following items:  
 
(1) Engine, including all lubricated parts, water 
pump, fuel pump, manifolds, engine block, cylinder 
head, rotary engine housings, flywheel, gaskets, and 
seals; 
 
(2) Transmission, including the transmission case, 
internal parts, torque converter, gaskets, and seals, 
except four -wheel drive vehicles shall be excluded 
from coverage as provided for in this paragraph;  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
5  district court also  erred when it  found that Buyers failed to 
carry their burden of proving that the clutch assembly was 
damaged or otherwise defective when they took possession of the 
Vehicle.  These errors are due to a distinction between the 
language that HFI used to describe the damage/defect that it 
found on the Vehicle (a “burnt clutch”) and the actual repairs 
that HFI eventually made to the Vehicle (replacement of the 
entire “clutch assembly” including the pressure pad, slave 
cylinder, and flywheel).  HFI was statutorily required to repair 
the clutch assembly in the Vehicle without charge  and, thus, was 
not entitled to retain Buyers’ $1 ,000.00 deposit.

(continued . . .)  II.  STANDARDS OF REVIEW  
A.  Summary Judgment  
  We review the district court’s orders of summary 
judgment under the same standard applied by the district  court.  
Makaneole , 77 Hawai‘i at 420, 886  P.2d at 757.  “Summary judgment 
is appropriate where the moving party demonstrates that there 
are no genuine issues of material fact and it is entitl ed to 
judgment as a matter of law.”  Reed v. City & Cty. of Honolulu , 
76 Hawai‘i 219, 225, 873 P.2d 98, 104 (1994).  
B.  Statutory Interpretation  
  The district  court’s interpretation of a statute is 
reviewed de novo .  State v. Pacheco , 96 Hawai‘i 83, 94, 26 P.3d 
572, 583 (2001).   
III.  DISCUSSION  
A.   The ICA Did Not Err in Finding that There Was No Unfair or 
 Deceptive Act or Practice Where Buyers Voluntarily Signed 
 Contracts Agreeing to a Base Price of $41,800.47 for the 
 Vehicle 
  In order to obtain r elief under HRS §  480-2,5 a 
consumer must establish:  “(1) a violation of  HRS § 480-2; 
                     
5  HRS § 480 -2 provides:  
 
Unfair competition, practices, declared unlawful  
 
(a) Unfair methods of competition and unfair or 
deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or 
commerce are unlawful.  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
7 (2) injury to the consumer caused by such a violation; and 
(3) proof of the amount of damages.”  Davis v. Wholesale Motors, 
Inc., 86 Hawai‘i 405, 417, 949 P.2d 1026, 103 8 (App. 1997).  A 
trade practice violates  HRS § 480-2 when “it offends established 
public policy and when the practice is immoral, unethical, 
oppressive, unscrupulous or substantially injurious to 
consumers.”  Balthazar v. Verizon Hawaii, Inc. , 109 Hawai‘i 69, 
77, 123 P.3d 194, 202 (2005)  (internal quotation marks omitted) 
(quoting Hawai‘i Cmty. Fed. Credit Union v. Keka , 94 Hawai‘i 213, 
228, 11 P.3d 1, 16 (2000)) .  This court has held that “a 
deceptive act or practice is (1) a representation, omission, or 
practice that (2) is likely to mislead consumers acting 
reasonably under the circumstances where (3) the representation ,

(b) In const ruing this section, the courts and the 
office of consumer protection shall give due consideration 
to the rules, regulations, and decisions of the Federal 
Trade Commission and the federal courts interpreting 
section 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission A ct (15 
U.S.C. 45(a)(1)), as from time to time amended.  
 
(c) No showing that the proceeding or suit would be 
in the public interest (as these terms are interpreted 
under section 5(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act) is 
necessary in any action brought un der this section.  
 
(d) No person other than a consumer, the attorney 
general or the director of the office of consumer 
protection may bring an action based upon unfair or 
deceptive acts or practices declared unlawful by this 
section.

(continued . . .)  omission, or practice is material.”  Courbat v. Dahana Ranch, 
Inc., 111 Hawai‘i 254, 262, 141 P.3d 427, 435 (2006)  (cleaned up) 
(quoting F.T.C. v. Verity Int’l, Ltd. , 443 F.3d 48, 63 (2d Cir. 
2006)). 
  Here, Buyers argue that HFI violated HRS §  480-2 by 
increasing the base  price of the Vehicle from a negotiated price 
of $40,000 .00 to $41,800.47 in the first and second purchase 
contracts  without bringing the change in price to Buyers’ 
attention .  In granting summary judgment on this issue in favor 
of HFI, the district court found that there was no question of 
material fact that the alleged behavior did not constitute a 
deceptive act or prac tice.  The ICA affirmed the grant of 
summary judgment  on the grounds that Buyers had voluntarily 
signed two purchase agreements that readily identified the base 
price of the Vehicle as $41,800.47 .   
  In HFI’s pre -trial Request for Admissions , completed 
by Buyer Lindsey, Buyers “ [a]dmit” that “[Buyers] agreed to 
purchase the Vehicle for $49,262.83, including fees.”6  This 
                     
6  The base price of the vehicle exclude d fees and additional costs.  
$41,800.47 was the base price used to calculate the total price of $49,262.83 
for the vehicle purc hase.  Buyers allege that:  
 
[they are] not saying that they did not agree to buy 
the car for a certain price, nor,  for that matter, that 
they did not actually buy it at that price.  They were 
saying that  their agreement to buy at $49,262.83 
(originally $4 6,917.28) and their actual  purchase at that 
price were obtained by fraud, in that they were tricked *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
9 admission, coupled with the fact that Buyers signed two purchase 
contracts agreeing to the base  price of $41,800.47 , demonstrates 
that Buyers were aware that they were purchasing the Vehicle for 
the price that appeared in the contract.  See Leong v. Kaiser 
Found. Hosps. , 71 Haw. 240, 245, 788 P.2d 164, 168 (1990) 
(explaining that the “general rule of contract law is that one 
who assents to a contract is bound by it and cannot complain 
that he has not read it or did not know what it contained”).  
Moreover, the purchase contracts signed by Buyers contained 
merger clauses, stating that the contract s were complete and 
final representation s of the terms of the contract s.  Because 
Buyers were , or should have been,  aware that they were agreeing 
to purchase the Vehicle for a base price of $41,800.47, the 
alleged increase in price from the negotiated price of 
$40,000.00 does not amount to a violation of HRS § 480 -2 because 
the act or practice was “[un] likely to mislead consumers acting 
reasonably under the circumstances [.]”  See Courbat, 111 Hawai‘i 
at 262, 141 P.3d at 435 .  Accordingly, the district court did 
                     
(...continued) 
 
into signing the  agreement to buy at that price through the 
process of (1) Defendant’s salespeople and  Plaintiffs 
having successfully negotiated the price t o be $40,000 for 
the car itself,  followed by (2) Defendant’s substituting 
$41,800.47 as the “Base Price of Vehicle.”  Defendant used 
the larger figure in calculating the “Total Price” on the 
“AUTOMOBILE  PURCHASE AGREEMENT.”  Defendant had a duty to 
disclose  the change but  remained silent.  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
10 not err in granting summary judgment in fa vor of HFI as to the 
question of whether HFI committed a UDAP violation related to 
the sales price of the Vehicle.   
B.   The Statutory Warranty Under HRS §  481J-2 Covers the 
 Components of the Clutch Assembly and Required HFI to 
 Repair Such Damage at No Cost to Buyers  
  HRS § 481J-2 governs used motor vehicle sales and 
warranties.  It requires the dealer to provide a written 
warranty covering “the full cost of both parts and labor 
necessary to repair any defect or malfunction in a part covered 
under subse ction (c) that impairs the used motor vehicle’s 
safety or use.”   HRS § 481J -2(c) includes an enumerated list of 
covered items:  
(c) . . .  Covered parts shall at least  include the 
following items:  
  
(1) Engine, including all lubricated parts, water 
pump, fu el pump, manifolds, engine block, cylinder 
head, rotary engine housings, flywheel, gaskets, and 
seals; 
 
(2) Transmission, including the transmission case, 
internal parts, torque converter, gaskets, and seals, 
except four -wheel drive vehicles shall be exclu ded 
from coverage as provided for in this paragraph;  
 
(3) Drive axle, including front and rear drive axle 
housings and internal parts, axle shafts, propeller 
shafts, and universal joints, except four -wheel drive 
vehicles shall be excluded from coverage as provided 
in this paragraph;  
 
(4) Brakes, including master cylinder, vacuum assist 
booster, wheel cylinders, hydraulic lines and 
fittings, and disc brake calipers;  
 
(5) Radiator;  
 
(6) Steering, including the steering gear housing and 
all internal parts, pow er steering pump, valve body, 
piston, and rack; and  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
11  (7) Alternator, generator, starter, and ignition 
system, excluding the battery.  
 
HRS § 481J-2(c) (emphasis added).  The question of whether the 
clutch assembly is covered under HRS § 481J-2(c) is fundame ntal 
to the determination of Buyers’ claims.  Though the ICA did not 
discuss whether the clutch assembly is covered under HRS §  481J-
2(c), the district court held in Finding of Fact (“ FOF”) Number 
(“No.”) 29 that “[m]anual clutch mechanisms are not include d in 
express warranties for used car sales under HRS § 481J -2.”  To 
determin e whether HRS § 481J -2(c) covered the clutch assembly, 
the district court consulted  the Merriam-Webster Dictionary as 
to the definition of the word “clutch .”  Using the Merriam -
Webster definition, the district court determined in FOF No. 30 
that “[t]he Merriam -Webster Dictionary denotes that a clutch 
mechanism is situated between the engine and the transmission of 
a motor vehicle”7 and explained that  “the clutch is what’s 
between th e engine and what some people call the gear box, i.e. 
transmission.  So I’m satisfied that, in common terminology, it 
was not intended that clutch mechanisms be included within the 
express warranty for used car sales .”  In FOF No. 32, the 
                     
7  The district court noted at trial that  the Merriam-Webster 
Dictionary  explained that “if you were in the British Isles, clutch would be 
included in the drive shaft, the entire mechanism, but if you are in the U.S. 
of A, the clutch is what’s between the engine and what some people call the 
gear box, i.e. transmission.”  Indeed, even by the dictionary definition 
relied upon by the district court, the “drive shaft” is specifically 
enumerated as a covered part in HRS § 481J -2(c).  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
12 district court fo und that “[e]ven if the clutch was covered by 
the warranty covering the Vehicle, HFI was not required to 
undertake warranty repairs on the clutch in the event of abuse 
or neglect” and “obviously it’s [Buyers’] burden to establish by 
a preponderance that . . . [the clutch] wasn’t that way [(i.e., 
burned out )] before.”8  Accordingly, the district court concluded 
that “as to the warranty issue, there is no unfair or deceptive 
act or practice” because even if the clutch assembly was covered 
under HRS §  481J-2(c), HRS §  481J-2(c)’s warranty would not 
apply because Buyers failed to prove that  they did not engage in 
abuse or neglect that damaged the clutch.  As discussed below, 
FOF Nos. 29, 30, and 32 are clearly erroneous.  
  Statutory interpretation  is a question  of law that is 
reviewed de novo.  Courbat, 111 Hawai‘i at 260, 141 P.3d at 433.  
When construing a statute, “our foremost obligation is to 
ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature, 
which is to be obtained primarily from the language c ontained in 
the statute itself.”  Id. (quoting Gray v. Admin. Dir. of the 
Court, 84 Hawai‘i 138, 148, 931 P.2d 580, 590 (1997)).  HRS 
§ 481J-2(c) is unambiguous as to whether it covers the 
components of the clutch assembly --the “flywheel” and the  
                     
8  As discussed infra, it was error for the district court to place 
this burden on Buyers, as HFI’s claim that it was entitled to retain the 
$1,000.00 deposit to offset the cost of the repairs was in the nature of an 
affirmative defense, the burden of which was on HFI.  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
13 “gaskets”  and “seals” that failed in the slave cylinder --that 
HFI replaced.  Accordingly, the district court’s reliance on the 
Merriam-Webster Dictionary , and its FOF No. 30,  was error.   
  HRS § 481J -2 requires the dealer , here, HFI, to 
provide a written warranty covering “the full cost of both parts 
and labor necessary to repair any defect or malfunction in a 
part covered under subsection (c) that impairs the used motor 
vehicle’s safety or use.”   The plain language of HRS § 481J -2(c) 
explicitly list s “covered part s” that include components of the 
manual clutch assembly that were replaced by HFI.   It is 
undisputed that HFI replaced at least the clutch pressure pad, 
the slave cylinder  (due to a failed rubber gasket) , and the 
flywheel in the Vehicle.  Explicitly l isted among the covered 
parts in HRS § 481J -2(c) are the flywheel, gaskets, seals, all 
lubricated parts, internal parts, and torque converter.9   
HFI was explicitly required to cover the components on 
the clutch assembly --“gaskets” and “seals” that failed in t he 
slave cylinder and the “ flywheel” --that it replaced in the 
Vehicle.  HFI mechanic and expert witness Henry Tabios 
(“Tabios”)  testified that a “slave leak” occurs in “the 
hydraulic part of the clutch”  and Buyers’ expert witness Kenneth 
Moniz (“Moniz”) testified that such a leak would be caused by a 
                     
9  An HFI expert witness stated in an interrogatory that a clutch is 
part of a transmission ; however, he changed his testimony at trial.   *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
14  
(continued . . .)  leak in the “rubber seal, and most leaks [are] from wear and 
tear.”  HRS § 481J -2(c) lists “all lubricated parts,” “internal 
parts,” and lists “gaskets [] and seals” twice , under both 
subsection s (c)(1) and (c)( 2).  Thus, the slave cylinder (or, at 
the very least, the gaskets and seals that failed in the slave 
cylinder) is covered under the statutory warranty.   See HRS 
§ 481J-2(c).  HRS § 481J -2(c) explicitly requires a dealer to 
warrant the “flywheel[.]”  Id.  It is uncontested that the 
flywheel was damaged and had to be replaced.  Accordingly, the 
flywheel is covered under the statutory warranty.   See id.  
Although HRS §  481J-2(c) does not explicitly name the “clutch” 
or “clutch assembly[,]” the statute’s refere nce to the “torque 
converter” captures the statute’s intent to cover the equivalent 
components in a manual transmission vehicle.  Buyers’ expert 
witness, Moniz,  testified that “the torque converter” in an 
automatic vehicle “has the same function as a clutc h” in a 
manual transmission vehicle.   Therefore, the entire clutch 
assembly (including the clutch pressure pad) is covered under 
the statutory warranty , and the district court’s FOF No. 29 was 
erroneous.10  See HRS § 481J-2(c). 
                     
10  The interpretation of HRS § 481J -2(c)(2) could also rely on the 
commonsense understanding of  the word “transmission” as itself including the 
“clutch assembly” in a vehicle with a manual transmission .  While the clutch 
mechanism sits in between the engine and the transmission, a reasonable 
consumer is likely to read “transmission” as encompassing  the clutch, given *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
15   The district court  also erred in holding that Buyers 
failed to carry “their burden of proving that the clutch 
[assembly] was damaged or otherwise defective when they took 
possession of the Vehicle.”  The placement of this burden on 
Buyers was an error of law , and the district court’ s FOF No. 32 -
-that “[e]ven if the clutch was covered by the warranty covering 
the Vehicle, HFI was not required to undertake warranty repairs” 
because the Buyers failed  “to establish by a preponderance that 
. . . [the clutch]  was burned out, burned, wasn’t  that way 
before”--was erro neous.   
  Here, where HFI retain ed Buyers’ $1 ,000.00 deposit to 
offset the costs of the “clutch assembly” replacement, the 
burden was on HFI to prove that Buyers ruptured a gasket on the 
slave cylinder and destroyed  the clutch  assembly in the span of 
forty-seven miles, not as a result of “normal wear or usage[ .]”  
As discussed below, Buyers established by uncontested expert 
testimony that a leaky slave cylinder cannot be caused by use or

the clutch mechanism’s essentiality in engaging and disengaging the 
transmission from the drive shaft’s moving parts.   Moreover, unlike HRS § 
481J-2(c), other state  statutes  explicitly exclude  parts of a vehicle that 
wear out with ordinar y use.  See N.J. Rev. Stat. § 56:8-67(1) (2013) 
(defining “covered item [s]” to exclude “a manual clutch, pressure plate, 
throw-out bearings, clutch master or slave cylinders ”)  If the Hawai‘i 
legislature intended to exclude “wear items,” such as the clutch, they could 
have done so , but did not.   As the commonsense understanding of 
“transmission”  includes the clutch  in a vehicle with manual transmission , and 
the Hawai‘i legislature did not exclude “wear items ,” the clutch and clutch 
assembly are covered by t he warranty.  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
16  misuse in forty-seven miles.  Accordingly,  HFI could not have 
established by a preponderance that Buyers damaged the clutch 
due to “abuse or neglect” rendering the HRS § 481J-2(c) warranty 
inapplicable.    
  Accordingly, the district court’s FOF No. 28 (that 
Buyers had “failed to sustain their burd en of proof that the 
clutch was damaged or otherwise defective at the time they took 
possession of the Vehicle”) was clearly erroneous.  Likewise, 
the ICA erred in finding that that FOF No. 28 was not “clearly 
erroneous.”   
C.   The ICA Erred by Finding th at HFI was Entitled to Retain 
 the $1,000.00 Deposit to Offset its Costs in Repairing the 
 Clutch 
  Buyers argue that the ICA incorrectly held that the 
district court did not err when it found that HFI did not commit 
a UDAP violation by retaining Buyers’ $ 1,000.00 deposit.11  The 
district court, and subsequently the ICA, found that HFI was 
entitled to retain Buyers’ deposit, in part, because the 
purchase agreement contained a term which stated that “If I do 
not accept delivery of the vehicle I purchased, [HF I] may keep 
                     
11  The district court originally ruled in favor of Buyers on summary 
judgment for Buyers’ third UDAP claim (that the clutch assembly was defective 
at delivery and HFI was not entitled to retain the $1 ,000.00 deposit).  
However, testimony was presented at trial on this point , and the district 
court included in its FOF No. 28, that “Plaintiffs have failed to sustain 
their burden of proof that the clutch was damaged or otherwise defective at 
the time they took possession of the Vehicle[.]”   *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
17 my cash deposit as payment for [HFI’s] costs.”  HFI provided 
evidence, including the testimony of Tabios and HFI’s Exhibit Q, 
that established that it cost HFI $1,110.04 or 1,109.7512 to 
replace the broken clutch assembly that, by HFI’s own evid ence, 
included the flywheel, clutch, pressure pad, and slave cylinder.   
  Whether HFI could retain the $1 ,000.00 deposit depends 
upon whether the clutch assembly was defective when Buyers took 
possession of the Vehicle or whether Buyers caused the damage to 
the clutch assembly in the forty-seven miles they had possession 
of the Vehicle.  In answering this question, the ICA concluded  
that the district court’s finding that “Buyers failed in their 
burden of proving that the clutch was damaged or otherwise 
defective when they took possession of the Vehicle ” was not 
“clearly erroneous” because HFI presented substantial evidence 
that the “clutch was ‘burnt’” by Buyers after Buyers received 
possession of the car.   
This finding was erroneous.  The evidence establi shed 
that the entire “clutch assembly” was replaced , not just the 
clutch pressure pad, due in part to a leaky slave cylinder and a 
burned flywheel.  Moreover, the evidence was uncontested that a 
leaky hydraulic slave cylinder cannot be caused by use or mis use 
                     
12  HFI’s version of the receipt has a handwritten price of 
$1,109.75.  Buyers’ version of what appears to be an internal version of the 
same receipt lists the price as $1,110.04.   *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
18  for forty-seven miles.13  Evidence that the leaky hydraulic slave 
cylinder cannot be caused by use or misuse for forty-seven 
miles14 in conjunction with evidence that the “clutch assembly” 
was damaged and needed to be replaced, established that the 
clutch was damaged or defective when Buyers took possession of 
the Vehicle.   
  Both Buyers testified that Lindsey raised concerns 
about the clutch during the test drive15 and that HFI told Buyers 
not to worry , repeating that  “it was a high -performance clutch” 
and, therefore , felt different.16  Testimony from Buyers’ expert 
witness Moniz suggested that the “soft” clutch that Lindsey 
                     
13  Moniz testified that “40 miles additional mileage” on any vehicle 
would “ne ver, ever” cause the clutch assembly to wear out, “[s]omething must 
have given way.”  Likewise, Moniz testified that a failure in the slave 
cylinder could not be caused by driving for “40 miles” and if it failed 
during the “40 miles” Buyers drove it, “[i]t  must have been coincidental, 
because I don’t think you can drive a car for 40 miles and cause it to leak.  
It had to have been on its way out.”   
 
14  Expert witness Tabios testified that the entire clutch assembly 
needed to be replaced because the slave c ylinder “had a seepage, so they 
ended up replacing that.  But the main problem on this was the clutch disc 
was burnt.”  Tabios also testified that he observed “burn marks on the clutch 
disc and the fly wheel.”  The invoice produced by HFI for the repair li sted 
the “description of cause” as “replace flywheel, clutch, and pressure plate; 
replace clutch slave -leaking; bleed clutch system, top off fluid level.”  
HFI’s invoice listed the part number, quantity, and list number for the “new 
parts” that were instal led during the repair, including the “flywheel[,]” a 
“KIT - CL[,]” a “cylinder[,]” “cylinder ASY - clutch[,]” and “fluid - 
brake[.]”   
 
15  Lindsey testified that “you had to feed it a – a lot of gas so it 
wouldn’t stall out[.]”   
 
16  HFI salesperson Angel  Mendias testified that the issues during 
the test drive were not due to “something wrong with the clutch,” rather the 
issue was “[t]he way [Lindsey] was shifting[.]”   *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
19    complained of during the test  drive was the result of a leaky 
gasket in the slave cylinder.  Thus, this record supports the 
conclusio n that the clutch assembly was damaged or defective 
when Buyers took possession of the Vehicle and was not damaged 
as a result of Buyers’ use or misuse.  
  Lindsey’s presale concerns about the clutch are 
evidenced not only by his and Leong’s testimony, but also by the 
“Get Ready Authorization” containing handwritten notes in a box 
titled “ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS[.]”  The additional agreements 
stated:  “sold as is [and] as equipped” with the circled phrase 
“have service check clutch cust. states ‘soft’” and an “OK” 
written next to the manager’s initials “HV[.]”  Accordingly, the 
evidence demonstrates that Buyers raised concerns after test 
driving the Vehicle about a “soft clutch” --consistent with a 
leaky slave cylinder --prior to signing the second Vehicle 
purchase agreement,17 and HFI represented that it would “check 
[the] clutch” as an “additional agreement” to the sale.18   
  The district court, and subsequently the ICA, 
determined that HRS §  481J-2 did not cover the clutch assembly 
                     
17  The handwritten note appears to have been written after the first 
purchase agreement  was signed but before the second purchase agreement was 
signed. 
 
18  The ICA did not consider  the evidence of the handwritten notation 
on the Get Ready Authorization.   *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
20 and that Buyers had “failed in  their burden of proving that the 
clutch was damaged or otherwise defective when they took 
possession of the Vehicle.”   
  As discussed previously, HRS § 481J-2 explicitly 
covers the flywheel, gaskets, seals, all lubricated parts, 
internal parts, and torqu e converter.  The evidence in the 
record--that the clutch assembly had to be replaced and that 
damage requiring such replacement would “never, ever” be caused 
by driving just forty-seven miles--supports the conclusion that 
the clutch assembly, or at least the slave cylinder, was 
defective at the time Buyers took delivery of the Vehicle.  Put 
simply, the record does not contain evidence to support the 
district court’s finding that Lindsey, who had life-long 
experience driving manual transmission vehicles19 and had over 
275,000 miles on the manual clutch of his Ford F -350, would burn 
out the clutch assembly and cause a slave cylinder leak by 
driving a high -performance racing vehicle for forty-seven miles.  
Amfac, Inc. v. Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co. , 74 Haw. 85 , 116, 
839 P.2d 10, 27 -28 (1992) (holding that a “FOF is clearly

the warranty for used cars in HRS §  481J-2 did not cover the 
clutch assembly and that Buyers had “failed in their burden of 
proving that the clutch was damaged or otherwise defective when 
they took possess ion of the Vehicle” was clearly erroneous.   
V.  CONCLUSION  
  For the foregoing reasons, we affirm in part and 
vacate in part the  ICA’s March 12, 2020 Judgment on Appeal 
affirming the district court’s March 24, 2015 Order on Motion 
for Summary Judgment and  August 25, 2015 Judgment.  The ICA 
erred when it affirmed  the district court regarding  Buyers’ 
remaining UDAP claims.  Therefore,  this case is remanded to the 
district court for proceedings consistent with this summary 
disposition order .  The ICA’s judgme nt on appeal is affirmed in 
all other respects.
