RECKTENWALD, C.J., NAKAYAMA, McKENNA, POLLACK, and WILSON, JJ.
 
PER CURIAM
 
The sole jurisdictional issue before this court concerns the 
effect of the entry of an amended judgment, entered after the 
filing of a post-judgment tolling order, on the timing to file an appeal under Rule 4 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
(“HRAP”). Petitioner/plaintiff-appellant Robert E. Wiesenberg *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(“Wiesenberg”) applies for certiorari review of the Intermediate 
Court of Appeals’ (“ICA”) February 16, 2016 order (“Dismissal Order”) dismissing as untimely his appeal from a final amended judgment issued by the first circuit court following the entry of a post-judgment order relating to attorneys’ fees and costs. Wiesenberg contends that the appeal is timely because the final amended judgment alters the original judgment in a material and substantive respect and, therefore, the filing of the final amended judgment triggered the date for filing the notice of appeal. The University of Hawai' i (“UH”) contends that the 
appeal is untimely because the final amended judgment did not alter the original judgment in such a way as to materially affect the substantive rights of the parties and, therefore, the post-judgment order on the attorneys’ fees and costs triggered the date for filing the notice of appeal. 
We conclude that the final amended judgment amended the
 
original judgment in a material and substantial respect such that
 the appeal deadline began to run from the date that the final
 amended judgment was filed by the circuit court. Wiesenberg’s
 appeal is, therefore, timely. Accordingly, we vacate the ICA’s
 February 16, 2016 Dismissal Order and remand the matter to the
 ICA for disposition of the appeal.
 
I. Background
 
A. Brief Factual History 
In the fall of 2005, Wiesenberg was accepted into the
 
2
   
 
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
University of Hawai' i at Mânoa’s (“UH-Mânoa”) master’s degree 
program for Library and Information Science. During the 2007 
academic year, Wiesenberg was placed on academic probation and then later dismissed from the program after he failed to raise his grade point average. He was denied readmission in 2008 and 2009. 
B. Procedural History
 1. The Lawsuit 
On August 19, 2013, after participating in the
 
administrative and academic grievance process, Wiesenberg, pro
 se, filed a complaint in the first circuit court naming UH-Mânoa
 as the defendant and seeking more than $7 million in damages he
 alleged he suffered because UH-Mânoa did not award him his
 graduate degree.
1 Two months later, on October 8, 2013,
 
Wiesenberg filed an amended complaint for unjust enrichment
 naming UH as the defendant and seeking $500,000.00 in damages. 
The original complaint was eventually dismissed without prejudice
 because UH-Mânoa was not a proper party to the lawsuit.
2
 
On April 4, 2014, Wiesenberg, represented by counsel, moved
 
for leave to file a second amended complaint. The proposed
 second amended complaint named UH as the defendant, included
 additional background information related to Wiesenberg’s
 dismissal from the graduate program, and alleged claims for
 declaratory judgment/injunctive relief, unjust enrichment, unfair

or deceptive trade practices/acts, and interference with
 
prospective economic advantage. Wiesenberg sought an order
 compelling UH to admit him into the master’s degree program for
 Library and Information Science for the sole purpose of awarding
 him his degree or, in the alternative, damages. The court,
 however, denied the motion on the ground that the proposed
 amendment was futile because the statute of limitations had run:
 
Upon review and consideration of the matters
submitted, the Court denies the Motion for Leave to
File Second Amended Complaint; the proposed amendment
is futile because the statute of limitations has run. 
Plaintiff’s claim accrued in December 2007 when he was
 dismissed from the graduate program.  The continuing
tort doctrine does not apply to the alleged facts
herein; Plaintiff does not allege ongoing wrongful
conduct.  The alleged wrongful conduct occurred in
2007 and Plaintiff has since been unsuccessful in
 obtaining relief.  Equitable estoppel does not apply
to extend the time period to file because there were
no extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of
the Plaintiff that made it impossible for him to file
within the statute of limitations.  
Garner v. State ,
 
122 Haw. 150 (Haw. App. 2009).
 
(Italics omitted and underlining added.) 
UH then moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that
 
the allegations pleaded in Wiesenberg’s 2013 amended complaint
 
were similarly barred as a matter of law.  Wiesenberg opposed the
 motion. The circuit court granted the motion and entered its
 written order on May 5, 2015.   On June 3, 2015, the court entered
 
judgment in the case (“Original Judgment”). The Original
 Judgment states: 
4
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
JUDGMENT
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that
Judgment be and hereby is, entered in favor of
Defendant UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI 'I and against Plaintiff
ROBERT E. WIESENBERG on all claims herein. 
This Judgment fully and finally resolves all
claims between the parties and no other claims remain
in this proceeding.
There being no reason for delay, the Court
expressly directs that this Judgment be entered
forthwith.
 
The following day, on June 4, 2015, UH filed a motion for
 
attorneys’ fees, which Wiesenberg opposed. On July 31, 2015, the
 
court entered its post-judgment order on UH’s motion for
 attorneys’ fees.
 
A few days later, on August 4, 2015, UH’s counsel e-mailed
 
Wiesenberg’s counsel a proposed final amended judgment for his
 “review, signature, and approval.” Wiesenberg’s counsel was on
 Army duty on the mainland at that time and was not expected to
 return until August 17, 2015. On August 28, 2015, Wiesenberg’s
 counsel transmitted to UH’s counsel a signed final amended
 judgment approving it as to form. Some time thereafter, the
 signed final amended judgment was transmitted to the circuit
 court for approval and filing. 
On September 21, 2015, the circuit court entered the final
 
amended judgment (“Final Amended Judgment”). The Final Amended
 Judgment states:
 
5
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
FINAL AMENDED JUDGMENT
 
Judgment on the Pleadings having been granted to
Defen
dant UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI 'I, as against Plaintiff
ROBERT E. WIESENBERG, by Order filed May 5, 2015,
Judgment against Plaintiff ROBERT E. WIESENBERG and in
favor of Defendant UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI 'I, as was filed 
on June 3, 2015.
Pursuant to the July 31, 2015 Order Granting
Defendant UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII’S Motion for Attorneys’
Fees, Filed June 4, 2015, and in accordance with Rule
54(d)(2) of the Hawai 'i Rules of Civil Procedure, and 
§ 607-14 of the Hawai 'i Revised Statutes, the court
awarded Defendant UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI 'I reasonable 
attorneys’ fees as against Plaintiff ROBERT E.
WIESENBERG, in the amount of $14,543.75.
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that
a final judgment be, and hereby is, entered in
accordance with (1) the May 5, 2015 Order Granting
Defendant UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII’S Motion for Judgment
on the Pleadings, Filed December 5, 2014; and (2) the
July 31, 2015 Order Granting Defendant UNIVERSITY OF
HAWAII’S Motion for Attorneys’ Fees, Filed June 4,
2015, awarding Defendant UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI 'I 
attorneys’ fees in the amount of $14,543.75, as
against Plaintiff ROBERT E. WIESENBERG, on all claims
and causes of action asserted by Plaintiff in the
Amended Complaint filed on October 8, 2013.  The
 judgment shall bear statutory interest at a rate of
ten per cent a year following from the date of its
entry until payment.
  
This FINAL AMENDED JUDGMENT fully and finally
resolves all claims between the parties and no other
claims remain in this proceeding.
There being no reason for delay, the Court
expressly directs that this FINAL AMENDED JUDGMENT be
entered forthwith.
 
2. The Appeal 
On September 30, 2015, Wiesenberg filed a notice of appeal
 
in the ICA appealing from the Final Amended Judgment and all
 
underlying orders issued by the circuit court in the case.
 
UH subsequently moved to dismiss the appeal as untimely,
 
contending that Wiesenberg did not file his notice of appeal
 
6
 On February 16, 2016, the ICA granted UH’s motion to dismiss 
and entered the Dismissal Order dismissing the appeal for lack of 
jurisdiction on the ground that the appeal was untimely. The ICA determined that the Original Judgment was the operative judgment for purposes of the appeal and since the appeal deadline was tolled when UH timely filed its motion for attorneys’ fees and costs, the deadline for filing the appeal was thirty days from the July 31, 2015 post-judgment order on the attorneys’ fee motion.  The ICA concluded that the appeal deadline did not run from the filing of the Final Amended Judgment because the separate judgment requirement does not apply in the post-judgment context and, therefore, the Final Amended Judgment was superfluous. Citing Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai' i 153, 80 P.3d *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
within thirty days after the circuit court entered the July 31,
 2015 post-judgment order disposing of the motion for attorneys’
 fees. Wiesenberg opposed the motion, arguing that the appeal was
 timely because the Final Amended Judgment substantially and
 materially amended the Original Judgment by including attorneys’
 fees and post-judgment interest and, therefore, the thirty-day
 appeal deadline started to run from the date the Final Amended
 Judgment was entered by the court. Wiesenberg further argued
 that UH “lulled” him to wait before filing the notice of appeal
 by submitting the proposed Final Amended Judgment before the 30­day appeal period from the post-judgment order disposing of the
 motion for attorneys’ fees had run.
 
7
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
974 (2003), the ICA explained that “the separate judgment
 
requirement articulated in Jenkins [v. Cades Schutte Fleming &
 Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 869 P.2d 1334 (1994)] is inapposite in 
the post-judgment context” and that “[o]nce a circuit court has
 entered an appealable final judgment and an appealable post-
judgment order, any subsequent judgment on the same appealable
 post-judgment order is superfluous[.]” The ICA also concluded
 that the appeal deadline did not run from the filing of the Final
 Amended Judgment because, even though the circuit court entered
 two judgments on the same substantive claim, the inclusion of the
 award of attorneys’ fees and statutory interest in the Final
 Amended Judgment did not substantially or materially amend the
 substantive language of the Original Judgment: 
When, as here, a trial court has entered two
judgments on the same substantive claims, the
following general rule applies:
 
The general rule is that where a judgment
is amended in a material and substantial
 respect, the time within which an appeal
from such determination may be taken
begins to run from the date of the
amendment, although where the amendment
relates only to the correction of a
clerical error, it does not affect the
time allowed for appeal.

418, 49 P.3d 382, 384 (2002) (citation, internalquotation marks, and ellipsis points omitted; emphasisadded); State v. Mainaaupo, 117 Hawai 'i 235, 246 n.6, 
178 P.3d 1, 12 n.6 (2008). 
If the amendment of a final judgment or
decree for the purpose of correcting a
clerical error either materially alters
rights or obligations determined by the

 neither of these results, but instead
makes changes in the prior judgment which
have no adverse effect upon those rights
or obligations or the parties’ right to
appeal, the entry of the amended judgment
will not postpone the time within which an
appeal must be taken from the original
decree.
 
    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
prior judgment or decree or creates a
right of appeal where one did not exist
before, the time for appeal should be
measured from the entry of the amended
judgment.  If, however, the amendment has

418, 49 P.3d at 384 (citations, internal quotationmarks, and original brackets omitted; emphasis added). 
The ICA determined that the Final Amended Judgment did not amend
 
the substantive language of the Original Judgment because (1) the
 inclusion of the attorneys’ fees award was superfluous for the
 purpose of perfecting the right to appeal from the substantial
 adjudication that was already included in the Original Judgment,
 and (2) the inclusion of interest was superfluous because it
 simply reiterated the statutory right to obtain interest on the
 attorneys’ fees award.

3. The Application for Writ of Certiorari
 
On March 16, 2016, Wiesenberg timely filed an application
 
for writ of certiorari, which this court accepted for review. 
Wiesenberg presents two questions: 
(1) Did the ICA gravely err in holding that Wiesenberg’s
3
   In addressing Wiesenberg’s argument that UH “lulled” him into
 
inaction by drafting a proposed amended judgment, the ICA explained that, even
if true, “the failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a civil matter is a
jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot waive and the appellate courts
cannot disregard in the exercise of judicial discretion.”
 
9
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
September 30, 2015 notice of appeal was untimely under
HRAP Rule 4(a)(3)? 
(2) Did the ICA gravely err in determining that “lulling”
does not apply?
 
Wiesenberg argues that the ICA should have treated UH’s request
 
to amend the Original Judgment as a post-judgment motion under
 HRAP Rule 4(a)(3), should have recognized that the notice of
 appeal was timely under Poe because the Final Amended Judgment
 altered the Original Judgment in a material and substantial
 respect, and should have determined that Wiesenberg was “lulled”
 into inaction based on the confusion created when UH prepared and
 submitted for the court’s approval the Final Amended Judgment.
 Wiesenberg maintains that the ICA’s decision “will strike a
 grievous blow not only to Mr. Wiesenberg’s quest for justice, but
 to the conditions of fair play that can be expected by future
 litigants.” 
UH timely filed an opposition. UH argues that the ICA
 
correctly recognized that the Final Amended Judgment did not
 postpone the appeal deadline and, therefore, Wiesenberg’s appeal
 is untimely. UH contends that the submission of the proposed
 Final Amended Judgment was not a motion under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3),
 the Final Amended Judgment “merely re-stated the award of fees to
 [UH] and the applicable default interest (HRS § 478-3)” and “did
 not itself materially affect the substantive rights of the
 parties,” and UH did not “lull” Wiesenberg to miss the appeal
 deadline. 
10
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Wiesenberg addressed UH’s arguments in a reply and
 
reiterated that his appeal was timely.
 
II. Discussion 
The sole issue before this court is whether Wiesenberg’s
 
September 30, 2015 notice of appeal was timely. The answer
 
depends on whether the July 31, 2015 post-judgment order on the
 motion for attorneys’ fees or the September 21, 2015 Final
 Amended Judgment triggered the time from which to calculate the
 appeal deadline.
 
A. The Appeal Deadline and the Effect of a Tolling Motion
 
Generally, appeals from civil judgments must be filed within
 
30 days after entry of the final judgment. See HRAP Rule 4(a)(1)
 
(“When a civil appeal is permitted by law, the notice of appeal
 shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment or
 appealable order.”). The initial appeal deadline may be
 extended, however, by the timely filing of a post-judgment motion
 for attorneys’ fees and costs. Specifically, “[i]f any party
 files a timely motion . . . for attorney’s fees or costs, the
 time for filing the notice of appeal is extended until 30 days
 after entry of an order disposing of the motion[.]” HRAP Rule
 4(a)(3). 
The Original Judgment was filed on June 3, 2015. At that
 
moment, Wiesenberg had 30 days to file his notice of appeal. See
 
HRAP Rule 4(a)(1). However, when UH filed a timely motion for
 attorneys’ fees, the deadline to appeal was tolled and thereafter
 
11
  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
extended until thirty days after the court entered its July 31,
 
2015 order regarding attorneys’ fees. See HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). If
 
this was the last document filed in the record of the case,
 pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(3)’s plain language, the deadline for
 Wiesenberg to file his notice of appeal was August 31, 2015.
4
  
B. 	The Effect of a Final Amended Judgment on the Appeal
Deadline
 
The July 31, 2015 post-judgment order on UH’s motion for
 
attorneys’ fees was not the last document in the record of the
 
case, however. Instead, UH’s counsel prepared the Final Amended
 Judgment, Wiesenberg’s counsel signed the Final Amended Judgment,
 and the circuit court approved and filed the Final Amended
 Judgment. The issue turns then on the operative effect, if any,
 of the Final Amended Judgment for purposes of HRAP Rule 4’s
 appeal deadline. 
In 2000, the supreme court addressed this issue in Korsak v. 
Hawaii Permanente Med. Grp., 94 Hawai' i 297, 304, 12 P.3d 1238, 
1245 (2000). There, the court adopted the following rule as a guide in determining whether an amendment of an order or judgment affects the time for appeal: 
4
 The actual thirty day deadline was Sunday, August 30, 2015.  Because
 
the deadline fell on a Sunday, however, the deadline was extended to the
following day. See HRAP Rule 26(a) (“In computing any period of time
prescribed by these rules, . . . [t]he last day of the period shall be
included, unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday, in which event
the period extends until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, a
Sunday, or a legal holiday.”) 
12
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The general rule is that where a judgment is amended
in a material and substantial respect, the time within
which an appeal from such determination may be taken
begins to run from the date of the amendment, although
where the amendment relates only to the correction of
a clerical . . . error, it does not affect the time
allowed for appeal.
 
Moreover, if the amendment of a final judgment or
decree for the purpose of correcting a “clerical
error” either materially alters rights or obligations
determined by the prior judgment [or decree] or
creates a right of appeal where one did not exist
before, the time for appeal should be measured from
the entry of the amended judgment.  If, however, the
amendment has neither of these results, but instead
makes changes in the prior judgment which have no
adverse effect upon those rights or obligations or the
parties right to appeal, the entry of the amended
judgment will not postpone the time within which an
appeal must be taken from the original decree.
 
Korsak, 94 Hawai' i at 304, 12 P.3d at 1245 (emphasis added). 
A few years after Korsak was decided, the supreme court
 
applied its rule in Poe v. Hawai' i Labor Relations Board, 98 
Hawai'i 416, 49 P.3d 382 (2002). In Poe, the circuit court sua 
sponte entered an amended judgment to correct the caption of the
 
original judgment by changing the designation of one party from
 “respondent-appellee” to “intervenor-appellee.” Poe, 98 Hawai' i 
at 417-18, 49 P.3d at 383-84. A majority of the court determined
 that the correction was clerical in nature and had no adverse
 effect upon any rights or obligations or the parties’ right to
 appeal and, therefore, the notice of appeal was due no later than
 thirty days after the original judgment was filed. See id. at
 
419, 49 P.3d at 385.
 Korsak
 and Poe clearly delineate that, in situations where
 
13
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the court has entered two judgments on the same substantive
 
claim, commencement of the appeal deadline depends on whether the
 amended judgment amends the original judgment in a material and
 substantial way -- either materially altering the rights or
 obligations of the parties determined by the original judgment or
 creating a right to appeal where none previously existed. If it
 does, then the appeal deadline runs from the date of the amended
 judgment; if it does not, then the appeal deadline runs from the
 date of the original judgment.
 
C. 	The Final Amended Judgment Amended the Original
Judgment in a Material and Substantial Respect
 
Thus, consistent with Korsak and Poe, resolution of the
 
jurisdictional issue raised by the Dismissal Order is essentially
 
grounded on one fundamental question -- Does the Final Amended
 Judgment amend the Original Judgment in a material and
 substantial respect? We answer this question in the affirmative.
 
The changes between the Original Judgment and the Final
 
Amended Judgment are not clerical -- the changes are material and
 substantive inasmuch as they alter the rights and obligations of
 the parties. While the Original Judgment simply reiterates the
 prevailing party and includes the required language that all
 claims have been resolved, the Final Amended Judgment includes
 additional information on the award of attorneys’ fees as well as
 statutory interest:

 Pursuant to the July 31, 2015 Order
Granting Defendant UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII’SMotion for Attorneys’ Fees, Filed June 4,2015, and in accordance with Rule 54(d)(2) of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil 
Procedure, and § 607-14 of the Hawai' i

reasonable attorneys’ fees as againstPlaintiff ROBERT E. WIESENBERG, in the amount of $14,543.75.
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND 
DECREED that a final judgment be, andhereby is, entered in accordance with (1)the May 5, 2015 Order Granting DefendantUNIVERSITY OF HAWAII’S Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, Filed December5, 2014; and (2) the July 31, 2015 OrderGranting Defendant UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII’SMotion for Attorneys’ Fees, Filed June 4,2015, awarding Defendant UNIVERSITY OFHAWAI'I attorneys’ fees in the amount of
$14,543.75, as against Plaintiff ROBERTE. WIESENBERG, on all claims and causes 
of action asserted by Plaintiff in the

interest at a rate of ten per cent a year
following from the date of its entry
until payment.
This FINAL AMENDED JUDGMENT fully
and finally resolves all claims between
the parties and no other claims remain in
this proceeding.
There being no reason for delay, the
Court expressly directs that this FINAL
AMENDED JUDGMENT be entered forthwith.
 
15
   See*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The additional language creates new obligations and legal
 
consequences that did not exist under the Original Judgment. For
 example, by including the award of attorneys’ fees,
5
 the Final
Amended Judgment was a money judgment upon which UH could recover
 interest.
6 Moreover, UH may execute on the Final Amended
 
Judgment by recording it as a judgment lien against Wiesenberg’s
 
property7 or initiating collection and garnishment actions.8
 The
 
effect of the Final Amended Judgment provide serious legal
 implications for Wiesenberg -- legal implications that did not
 exist under the Original Judgment. These implications are not
 clerical in nature; rather, they are implications that altered
 the Original Judgment in a material and substantial respect. The
 Final Amended Judgment, therefore, was the operative document for
 purposes of this appeal. 
5
   We recognize that the circuit court need not reduce a post-judgment 
award of attorneys’ fees and costs to a separate judgment for purposes of an
appeal.  See Ditto, 103 Hawai 'i at 160, 80 P.3d at 981.  However, because the
court entered the Final Amended Judgment, this court’s review, for purposes ofdetermining whether the appeal was timely perfected, turns on an analysis ofthe effect of the amendments. 
6
 See HRS § 478-3 (2008) (“Interest at the rate of ten per cent a year,
 
and no more, shall be allowed on any judgment recovered before any court in
the State, in any civil suit.”).

  HRS § 636-3 (Supp. 2015) (“Any money judgment, order, or decree

correct by a clerk of the court where it is entered, is recorded in the bureau

16
     
                             *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Accordingly, the deadline for Wiesenberg to file his notice
 
of appeal commenced from the date the circuit court entered the
 
Final Amended Judgment on September 21, 2015. Wiesenberg,
 therefore, had up to and including October 21, 2015 to file his
 notice of appeal. Wiesenberg filed his notice of appeal on
 September 30, 2015. The appeal is timely.
