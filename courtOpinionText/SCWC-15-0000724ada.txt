OPINION OF THE COURT BY RECKTENWALD, C.J. 
 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
 
Jason Engelby was found guilty by a jury of two counts 
of Sexual Assault in the First Degree for molesting a minor 
child (Child), the daughter of a close friend, when Child was 
nine and ten years old.  Engelby appealed, and the Intermediate Electronically Filed

 Court of Appeals (ICA) affirmed.  On certiorari, we must assess 
Engelby’s claim that Dr. Alexander Bivens, the State’s expert 
witness in child sexual assault dynamics, impermissibly 
bolstered Child’s credibility.    1
The testimony that Engelby seeks to challenge now was 
not introduced during the State’s case-in-chief.  Rather, during 
its cross-examination of Dr. Bivens, the defense initiated a 
discussion about the credibility of alleged victims of child sexual assault, apparently to develop a theory that Child’s 
memories of the alleged assaults may have been suggested to her 
by someone else.  Specifically, the defense elicited testimony 
from Dr. Bivens that distinguished the circumstances in which a 
child would intentionally make false allegations about sexual 
assault from the circumstances in which a child would be 
susceptible to the implantation of false memories by third 
parties.  The State further developed that testimony on re-
direct examination, without any objection by the defense. 
Having used Dr. Bivens’ testimony on children’s 
general credibility to his own advantage, and having failed to object when the State elicited further testimony on re-direct 
examination, Engelby should not now be able to challenge that 
testimony on the basis of impermissible bolstering.  
                                                 
1 Engelby’s application for writ of certiorari also challenges Dr. 
Bivens’ testimony on a number of other grounds.  As discussed more fully 
below, the other issues raised by Engelby are without merit.

 Accordingly, we affirm the ICA’s judgment on appeal.   
II.  BACKGROUND
 
The State charged Engelby with two counts of Sexual 
Assault in the First Degree in violation of HRS § 707-730(1)(b).2  
The charges alleged that Engelby had molested Child on multiple 
occasions between December 1, 2011 and December 4, 2012.3   
A. Hawaiʻi Rules of Evidence Rule 104(a) Hearing 
Both parties had filed motions in limine prior to 
trial to determine whether Dr. Bivens was qualified to testify as an expert witness and, if so, what the appropriate scope of 
his testimony would be.  The State moved for the court to 
qualify Dr. Bivens as “an expert witness on the dynamics of child sexual assault,” and asserted that Dr. Bivens’ testimony 
would address the dynamics of child sexual assault and cover 
patterns of behavior exhibited by child victims of sexual 
assault “which [might otherwise seem] inconsistent with [the] 
behavioral norms of other victims of assault[,]” such as delayed 
                                                 
2 Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707 -730(1)(b) (2014) (Sexual 
Assault in the First Degree) provides that “[a] person commits the offense of 
sexual assault in the first degree if [t]he person knowingly engages in 
sexual penetration with another person who is less than fourteen years old.”  
 
 The State also charged Engelby with five counts of Sexual Assault 
in the Third Degree in violation of HRS § 707- 732(1)(b) (2014).  These 
charges were dismissed as defective, however, at a pretrial hearing on 
June 22, 2015.

 reporting and tunnel memory.   Engelby requested the court to 
conduct a hearing “to determine the qualifications and relevance 
of [Dr. Bivens’] testimony.”   4
Following the parties’ opening statements and 
testimony from the State’s first witness, Detective Brian Tokita 
with the Honolulu Police Department (HPD), the circuit court 
conducted a Hawaiʻ i Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 104(a) hearing 
outside the presence of the jury to determine these issues.   
The defense objected to Dr. Bivens testifying at 
trial.  First, the defense explained that it was “not 
challenging [] any of the contents of [Dr. Bivens’] curriculum 
vitae.”  Instead, the defense challenged his proffered testimony by arguing that it would be irrelevant and unduly prejudicial, 
improperly bolster the State’s witnesses, usurp the function of 
the jury, and improperly profile Engelby as a child molester.  
The defense explained: 
We are objecting based on not just [State v.] 
Batangan, [71 Haw. 552, 799 P.2d 48 (1990),] but 
we’re objecting for irrelevance.   
 
We are objecting that it would be unduly prejudicial 
to Mr. Engelby because it would be considered 
improper bolstering, and also we would object that it 
would also be improper profiling, and profiling of 
what a person who would commit these kinds of offenses may or may not be, and we would argue that 
that would be inherently prejudicial. 
 
Also, we object that it would be usurping the 
function of the jury, that the jury can determine, 
                                                 
4 At trial, Dr. Bivens described the phenomenon of tunnel memory as 
an individual’s enhanced recall of the details central to a traumatic event 
and weaker recall of the details peripheral to that event.    
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
5 
 from listening to the witnesses, whether or not they 
choose to feel someone’s credible or not, and it 
would violate my client’s rights under the due 
process clause.  
 
The defense contended that delayed reporting in cases 
of child sexual abuse was “part of the general knowledge of the 
public,” and that expert testimony on that topic was therefore 
not necessary.  The defense also questioned whether Dr. Bivens 
was qualified to address tunnel memory, and requested that the 
term “grooming” be “in limined” out.   
In response, the State asserted that Dr. Bivens’ 
testimony was relevant, and that testimony on “the dynamics of a sexual assault by a family member or someone close to the 
family” would assist the jury in understanding how children 
might experience and react to sexual abuse within the home.  The 
State explained that this dynamic was not familiar to lay 
people, and that children’s reactions in this type of situation 
might differ from the reactions that a person of ordinary 
understanding might otherwise expect.  The State also clarified, 
inter alia, that it sought to elicit testimony from Dr. Bivens 
about delayed reporting and tunnel memory, that Dr. Bivens 
“would not be commenting on anyone’s credibility or 
believability[,]” and that it would make clear to the jury that 
Dr. Bivens had no familiarity with the case or its witnesses.   
The circuit court ruled that Dr. Bivens’ testimony was 
relevant, noting that:  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
6 
 The Court is not in agreement with the defense in 
terms of this being general knowledge to which the 
jury does not need assistance . . . .  [T]he Court 
does believe that . . . the testimony of an expert 
would be of assistance to the jury with respect to 
specifically, the behaviors that are associated with this type of offense for delayed reporting and, 
perhaps, inconsistent reporting. 
 
The circuit court further ruled: 
[Dr. Bivens can] testify to his experience and 
research on delayed disclosure . . . [,] children’s 
reaction[s] to the event[s,] and [] explanation[s] of the manner[s] of disclosure and the reasons for the 
delay[s].  
 
At this point[,] the court will leave outstanding the testimony associated with tunnel memory, unless and 
until [Dr. Bivens] can be qualified that he’s able to 
testify as to tunnel memory[.]  [Additionally,] I’ll 
grant the [defense’s] oral motion to in limine out the word “grooming” in [Dr. Bivens’] testimony. 
 
B. Dr. Bivens’ Testimony 
Dr. Bivens was the next witness called by the State. 
After Dr. Bivens testified as to his credentials and 
qualifications, the circuit court qualified Dr. Bivens as an 
expert witness in clinical psychology “with [an] emphasis in the 
general dynamics of child sexual assault.”   
1. Direct Examination   
Dr. Bivens first explained that, in the context of 
child sexual assault, studies consistently showed “that sexual abuse most often occurs in the context of a preexisting 
relationship, preexisting nonsexual relationship between the 
adult and the child.”  Furthermore, he explained that in his own 
practice, he could only recall “a couple of cases . . . [of] 
stranger abuse[,]” and that “[m]ost often, [the molester would  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
7 
 be] someone [that the child] . . . knew well” and that the child 
and family trusted.  
 
Relating to delayed disclosure, Dr. Bivens testified 
that “[d]elay[ed disclosure] [was] the rule, [rather than] the 
exception” for children who had been sexually assaulted, and 
that “the most common thing [for children to] do when molested 
[was to] not say anything for a long time.”  He explained that 
it was not atypical for children to wait months or years to disclose their abuse, and also not atypical for them to “allow 
the abuse to continue . . . for a long period of time before 
disclosing.”  He explained, “[t]he closer the relationship 
between the abuser and the child, the longer it [would] take to 
disclose.”   
Dr. Bivens further discussed the most common reasons 
for children’s delayed disclosures, including fear of not being 
believed, embarrassment, and not wanting to harm anyone, as well 
as the types of situations that would prompt disclosure.  He then explained that children most often disclosed to their 
“mothers and close friends[,]” and that children’s initial 
disclosures often contained incomplete information.   
Dr. Bivens also explained that he was familiar with 
research on the topic of tunnel memory and that he dealt with 
patients “every week” within his clinical practice who were 
experiencing tunnel memory.  Based on this testimony, the  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
8 
 circuit court ruled that Dr. Bivens had adequately laid a 
foundation to testify on this topic.   With regard to tunnel 
memory, Dr. Bivens then explained that while “the details of the sexual abuse” would be remembered well by victims, peripheral 
details, such as “the dates and times” of the occurrences, 
“[would be] remembered less well.”   5
Dr. Bivens also discussed the typical interactions 
children had with their molesters, including: (1) “loving, seductive relationship[s]”; (2) “playful relationship[s] that 
[would] begin[] to involve sexual touching”; (3) “coercive 
relationship[s]”; and/or (4) “feeling taken advantage of[,]” in 
which the touching would occur while the children were sleeping.  
Dr. Bivens also testified that “there are two places where child 
sexual abuse most often occurs, and that it is the child’s own 
home and in the molester’s own home.”   
The State did not ask Dr. Bivens to comment on 
children’s credibility on direct examination, and Dr. Bivens did not do so.  Further, Dr. Bivens emphasized that he had never 
spoken with nor met the witnesses in the instant case and was 
unfamiliar with the case’s facts.  He explained, “I’ve just been 
talking about general dynamics.  And, in fact, the material that 
                                                 
5 On appeal to the ICA, Engelby argued that the circuit court erred 
by permitting Dr. Bivens to testify on the topic of tunnel memory.  Based on 
the record, however, we conclude that the circuit court did not abuse its 
discretion in this regard.    
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
9 
 I’ve shared today is very similar to the general dynamics 
training that I do.  It’s just [in] a longer format when I do 
that training.”   
2.   Cross-Examination 
The subject of children’s credibility was first raised 
on cross-examination, when the defense asked Dr. Bivens how he would “distinguish compromised recall from a situation where the 
child might be lying in the context of, say, a divorce where parties are fighting and maybe a child [would be] compelled to 
lie[.]”  In response, Dr. Bivens explained:  
[T]hat would depend a lot upon, you know, the nature 
of the report.  There are certain kinds of lies that 
are much less common for children to tell, children 
are less likely to lie.  If [] there are known 
consequences or likely consequences that are going to 
befall somebody else [- ] that would require certain 
kinds of malicious qualities that tend to be rare.  
 On the other hand . . . [,] in the cases that I’ve 
worked on where there were divorce problems, the 
child wasn’t necessarily the source of the report.  
The reports were coming [in] secondhand.  So there are a number of factors that you can look at. 
 
(emphasis added).    
The defense then asked Dr. Bivens to “comment on the 
phenomena of rehearsal[,] . . . implant[ing] a memory, or 
suggestibility[.]”  The following discussion ensued: 
DR. BIVENS:  So there is research on suggestibility.  
It is possible to implant a memory into a child’s 
mind.  Interestingly, it is also possible to implant 
[a] memory into an adult’s mind if you have enough [] 
knowledge about what you’re doing.  
 In the case of children, implantation of memories is 
more common and more likely to occur with very young 
children, preschool age. . . .  By the time you reach 
age seven, you’re talking about a child who is going  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
10 
 to be more resistant to this type of thing, although 
with enough concerted effort and enough technology 
you probably could pull it off in a seven- year-old 
also.   
 
DEFENSE:  And a concerted effort could just mean [] – 
an adult repeating something over and over again, it 
doesn’t necessarily mean like they have to use the 
Internet or –  
 
DR. BIVENS:  No, over and over again.  Repeated implantation[.] 
 
(emphases added).  
3. Re-Direct Examination 
On re-direct examination, the State asked Dr. Bivens 
to explain “a little bit” more about false reporting and suggestibility.  The defense did not object at any point during 
this discussion.   
STATE:  Now, doctor, you were just asked a few 
questions regarding false allegations or 
suggestibility.  Were there any . . . pivotal studies 
that you’re aware of that address this issue[?]  
 
DR. BIVENS:  Yes.   
 STATE:  Can you tell us about that?  
 
DR. BIVENS:  I certainly can.  So in the 1980s, there 
were several [] unfortunate incidents in which 
preschool children were [] inappropriately interviewed by well- minded people who believed there 
was a phenomenon of satanic ritualistic sexual abuse that was happening to these children.  There was no 
particular evidence of it and none of the children 
really reported anything prior.  But upon multiple, 
multiple interviews[,] these preschool age children, 
four and five, were pressured and otherwise coerced 
into making statements[,] and some of the children 
came to believe those statements.  
 It was a result of [] those incidents and the studies 
that [] looked at how that was accomplished and the 
practices that we use today to conduct investigation 
were developed to always avoid suggesting anything or 
bringing up the topic of anything that might have occurred.  And, in fact, when I consulted with the 
Children’s Justice Center, these appropriate 
practices are exactly the kind of thing that I talked  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
11 
 to them about.  So we know a lot about 
suggestibility, [and] again, [it is] more common in 
younger [children], and we work to avoid it as 
investigators.   
 
STATE:  So that was basically a learning experience, that situation that occurred in the 1980s?  
 
DR. BIVENS:  For [] the field of investigating claims 
of child sexual abuse[,] yes, it was.  
 STATE:  And . . . how have interviewers been . . . 
trained differently since then?  
 
DR. BIVENS:  [N]ow we have a very standardized 
process that we use to train our interviewers. . . . [O]ur practices have [] become dramatically better.  
[W]hat we find is that under appropriate interviewing 
conditions, we get very accurate reports from 
children.  And this is tested frequently.   
 
STATE:  And based upon your research and . . . your 
clinical experience, are you familiar with . . . 
false reporting and [] how often that occurs?  
 DR. BIVENS:  I am.    
STATE:  Okay.  Can you tell us a little bit about 
that?  
 
DR. BIVENS:  I can.  So the possibility or problem that children could lie is a deep concern to us as 
psychologists and so we study children lying.  It is 
possible to get a child to lie and we know a good bit 
about [] what is required and the kinds of lies that 
children are likely to tell.  
 The easiest kind of lie to get a child to perform is 
one where they simply withhold information or deny 
having information, basically saying nothing happened 
or I don’t know what happened in exchange for a reward with very low stakes.  In other words, nobody 
really gets in trouble.  So it’s sort of like hey, 
where did that cookie go?  I don’t know.  That’s an 
easy kind of lie to get a child to tell.  
 
The most difficult kind of lie to get a child to tell 
would be to get them to say something to – to come 
out with something that’s incorrect that didn’t happen and when the child knows that there’s going to 
be a significant consequences for another person.  And so that’s what . . . our research shows on a 
child lying.  As far as false allegations of child 
sexual abuse goes, there’s been a great deal of 
concern about this and there have been controversies 
in the scientific field as well.  But all of the most 
recent research indicates that children independently  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
12 
 are not likely to be sources of false allegations 
even in . . . the context of divorce.  We would be 
more likely to find a parent saying that a child 
said.  But in terms of an independent report 
emanating from a child, those are very infrequently 
found.   
 
(emphases added).   
4.   Re-Cross Examination 
The topic of credibility was raised again during re-
cross examination, when the defense asked Dr. Bivens to “follow 
up on the suggestibility portion” of his testimony.  This was the only subject the defense raised.  
DEFENSE:  So you shared with us that based on what 
happened in the ‘80s, changes were made to the 
training [] so that professionals who interview children have better techniques now; correct?  
 
DR. BIVENS:  [T]hey really do, yes.  
 
DEFENSE:  But suggestibility with a trained 
professional is – those special techniques and 
everything may not apply to, say, a parent, a family 
member or someone involved who doesn’t have that 
training; correct?  
 
DR. BIVENS:  That is correct.  
 
DEFENSE:  Okay.  So there is still that risk where 
nonprofessionals are involved when they’re 
questioning a child about certain things that they may or may not be accusing someone of?
 
 
DR. BIVENS:  Yes.  Particularly if this is on a 
repeated, sustained . . . basis where the parent is convinced that a certain result is what they’re trying to get out of a child. 
 
 
DEFENSE:  And would [] a reward system be a factor as 
well?  I believe you shared with us that sometimes 
children, if they are induced . . . with gifts or 
presents that they may be inclined to keep secrets.  
But would you also agree that they may be inclined to 
lie as well?  
 DR. BIVENS:  [M]aybe the easiest way that I can answer your question is to say that one of the 
practices [] we always refrain from as professionals 
is we don’t offer, you know, ice cream sandwiches if  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
13 
 you talk about the sex things that were done to you, 
right.  So . . . we specifically do not offer rewards 
for that specific reason.  
 
DEFENSE:  [A]s trained professionals?  
 DR. BIVENS:  Correct.  
 
(emphases added).   
C. Other Witness Testimony 
In addition to the testimony of Detective Tokita and 
Dr. Bivens, the State presented testimony from another HPD 
investigator, as well as from Child, Child’s older sister, and 
Child’s mother and her boyfriend.   
Child testified that Engelby came over to her house “a 
lot” as she was growing up, and that she and Engelby were “close.”  Child testified that it was not uncommon for Engelby 
to spend the night at her family’s house, sleeping either in the 
living room or the room she shared with her older sister.   
Child testified that Engelby began “touching her in 
ways she didn’t like” in December 2011 and that this touching continued until December 3, 2012.  She testified that she could 
not remember each day that he sexually abused her “because it 
happened a lot.”   
According to Child, Engelby touched her on multiple 
occasions while she slept in the living room; once after an 
outing at Ice Palace for her tenth birthday; and the night of 
December 3, 2012, after she had fallen asleep in her bedroom.  
Child testified that she did nothing when he touched her or  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
14 
 licked her “vagina area[,]” and that she felt scared and 
confused because she “didn’t know why he would do such a thing.”  
She explained that she did not scream when he touche
d her 
because it was “shocking” and because she “didn’t know what to do.”  She testified that Engelby would buy her clothes and 
earrings, and would occasionally slip money into her hand after 
he was done touching her.   
Initially, Child explained, she did not tell anyone 
about what Engelby was doing because she did not think anyone would believe her.  Later, however, she told her older sister 
and mother.   
Child’s older sister, as well as Child’s mother and 
her boyfriend, corroborated many aspects of Child’s testimony.  
Child’s sister, for instance, testified that “Uncle Jason” would 
come over to her family’s home a lot, including late at night.  
She testified that Engelby would sleep at their home, sometimes 
“lay[ing] down” in the bedroom she shared with Child, and “once in a while” laying down in Child’s bed.  She explained that when 
Child told her about the sexual abuse, “it was hard for [Child] 
to explain what she wanted to say” because “[s]he was crying and 
stuttering.”   
Child’s mother explained that Engelby was like family 
to her, and that he was “welcome to come and go [within the 
family’s home] as he pleased.”  She further testified that  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
15 
 Engelby could sleep over wherever he wanted to within the home, 
and that sometimes, she would go to sleep while Engelby was 
over, unaware of his exact location.  Child’s mother, as well as 
her boyfriend, testified that Engelby not only had a key to the 
home, but was also present the night of December 3, 2012 and the 
morning of December 4, 2012, when the last incident allegedly 
occurred.   
According to Child’s mother, she and her boyfriend 
were up that night to make periodic checks on her oldest daughter’s dog, which was dying.  It was during one of those 
checks, she explained, that she first saw Engelby in her home. 
She testified that she wasn’t shocked at Engelby’s presence, and 
that throughout the night, he helped them take care of the dog.  
The mother’s boyfriend testified that, at some time between 
12:30 and 2:00 a.m., he noticed Engelby in Child’s room on a 
folding mattress, illuminated by his phone.  According to 
Child’s mother, Child first disclosed her allegations against Engelby the evening of December 4th.   
D. 
Engelby’s Testimony 
Engelby then testified as the defense’s sole witness.  
Engelby explained that while he had always had a close 
relationship with Child’s family, and while he had lived with 
Child’s family for about a year in 2008 or 2009, he became more 
distant from them when he moved in with his girlfriend in 2010.   
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
16 
 Furthermore, he explained, although he had a key to Child’s home 
when he lived with Child’s family, the family had changed the 
locks in 2010.  As such, he denied having a key to the home at 
the time the alleged incidents occurred.   
Engelby testified that he had never touched Child in a 
sexual manner.  And, while he admitted to taking Child to Ice 
Palace for her tenth birthday, he contended that he had not been 
alone with her that day, as his girlfriend and her daughter met them there.  Engelby explained that while he had slept over at 
Child’s home in 2011, he did so as a favor to Child’s mother, 
who needed someone to take care of her children as she gave 
birth in the hospital.   
Engelby denied ever spending the night at Child’s home 
in 2012, and denied visiting the home the night of the last 
alleged incident, as Child’s mother and her boyfriend alleged.   
E. 
Jury Instructions 
After the testimony had concluded, but before the 
parties’ closing arguments, the circuit court provided the following instructions to the jurors explaining how they should 
weigh the evidence:  
COURT:  During the trial you heard the testimony of 
one or more witnesses who were described as experts.  
Training and experience may make a person an expert in a particular field.  The law allows that person to 
state an opinion about matters in that field. 
 
Merely because a witness has expressed an opinion 
does not mean, however, that you must accept this 
opinion.  It is up to you to decide whether to accept  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
17 
 this testimony and how much weight to give it.  You 
must also decide whether the witness’s opinions were 
based on sound reasons, judgment and information.   
 
(emphasis added).   
F. Closing Arguments 
 
Both the State and defense focused on the witnesses’ 
credibility in their closing arguments. 
The State explained that Child’s testimony established 
the “elements of each count beyond a reasonable doubt[,]” and 
told the jury that “if you believe[d] [Child], it’s over.”  The State made no references to Dr. Bivens’ statements about 
children’s propensities for truthfulness, and only addressed his 
testimony as follows: 
STATE:  Dr. Bivens came in here and [] gave you all a 
little insight into the way children who are sexually 
abused typically respond.  The way [Child] responds under these circumstances makes sense.  Her testimony 
was reasonable. 
. . . . 
[A]gain, Dr. Bivens just shared with you some of the 
common experiences of children who are sexually abused and that it’s typical for those children to 
play possum because they’re scared or confused.  Most 
of
 them do not disclose until a while later and most 
disclose to a mother or a close friend.  And he basically [] talked a little bit about his experience through research and through treating children who 
are sexually abused. 
  
The defense, on the other hand, attempted to cast 
doubt on Child’s credibility by putting forth a theory of 
suggestibility.  Specifically, the defense focused on the fact 
that Child, despite earlier opportunities to do so, did not 
initially disclose her allegation that Engelby had put his mouth 
on her vagina.  The defense thus contended:    
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
18 
 DEFENSE:  In addition, [Child] has testified that she 
felt a mouth licking her vagina.  The defense asks 
you to recall that [Child] did not say anything about 
a mouth on her vagina, let alone any sort of licking 
of her vagina, when she talked to the detective, when 
he went to gather her clothing, okay, and when she later spoke with him at the Children’s Justice 
Center. 
 
So let’s talk about the Children’s Justice Center for 
[] a second.  This is a special place where children are interviewed with trained professionals.  It’s a 
safe environment, not a cold . . . room at the HPD.  
It’s a special center designed to interview children 
by professionals.  And she never mentioned [the 
licking] during her interview with the detective.   
So let me clarify.  [Child] didn’t say anything about a mouth on her vagina when she’s interviewed and when 
they’re collecting her clothes and the detective is 
doing his gathering of evidence.  And she said nothing about a mouth on her vagina when she got 
interviewed at the Children’s Justice Center.  It’s 
only 16 days later [at a grand jury proceeding],6 
after she had all this time to be talking with her 
family or whatever that she decides to start saying 
that. 
 
It is not credible that a ten- year-old girl would 
simply forget that a man had his mouth on her vagina 
and was licking it.  And it’s not credible that she would wait to say something about it if it actually 
did happen.  And the defense submits that this is 
evidence that is simply just not true.  That this is 
added, that she may have been influenced by what 
someone else said or influenced by who knows, 
suggestion.  
 
We don’t know.  But there is a problem with this 
reporting.  Adding something later does not make it 
true and does not make it accurate.  That is a reasonable doubt about whether or not it even 
happened.  The defense submits that [Child’s] 
accuracy is in question and this omission, this 
failure to mention anything about [a] mouth on [her] 
vagina when she first got interviewed by the 
detective who sat down with her, is important.    
 
(emphases added).   
 
In rebuttal, the State again emphasized the topic of 
                                                 
6 Child first alleged that Engelby had licked her “vagina area” at 
a grand jury proceeding that took place on December 20, 2012.

19 
 credibility, but did not refer to any aspects of Dr. Bivens’ 
testimony on that matter.  In sum, the State argued: 
STATE:  If you believe [Engelby,] that means you 
don’t believe any of the other witnesses in this case 
because his testimony is the only one that goes astray.  And he is the only person that has motive to 
lie here. . . .  To protect himself. 
. . . .   
You have heard all the evidence in this case[.]  
[Child] is credible.  She’s not mistaken, she was very clear in her detailed testimony.  And she has no 
reason to lie.  The defendant sexually assaulted her 
and he betrayed that family’s trust.  Find him guilty 
as charged.
 
 
G. Engelby’s Conviction, Sentence, and Appeal 
Engelby was found guilty of two counts of Sexual 
Assault in the First Degree and was sentenced to two concurrent 
twenty-year terms of imprisonment.  On appeal to the ICA, Engelby contended that Dr. Bivens’ testimony denied his rights 
to due process and a fair trial.   
The ICA affirmed.  The ICA concluded that Dr. Bivens’ 
testimony was both relevant and helpful to the jury, and that it 
neither impermissibly profiled nor unduly prejudiced Engelby.  
The ICA declined to consider Engelby’s claim that Dr. Bivens’ 
testimony improperly relied on statistics to profile Engelby as a molester, on the basis that the issue had not been properly 
preserved for appeal.  The ICA further concluded that “Dr. 
Bivens did not opine on [Child’s] credibility [] or testify 
about the facts of the particular case.”  Thus, the ICA rejected 
that Dr. Bivens had bolstered Child’s credibility merely because 
the “details of [Child’s] story match[ed] the details of a  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
20 
 typical child sex abuse case.”   
Engelby timely filed an application for writ of 
certiorari.   
III.  STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. 
Admission of Opinion Evidence (Expert Testimony) 
“Generally, the decision whether to admit expert 
testimony rests in the discretion of the trial court.  To the 
extent that the trial court’s decision is dependent upon interpretation of court rule[s], such interpretation is a 
question of law, which [the appellate] court reviews de novo.” 
State v. McDonnell, 141 Hawaiʻ i 280, 289, 409 P.3d 684, 693 
(2017) (citing Barcai v. Betwee, 98 Hawaiʻ i 470, 479, 50 P.3d 
946, 955 (2002)). 
B. Plain Error Review 
Pursuant to Hawaiʻ i Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 52(b) 
(2012), this court may notice “[p]lain errors or defects 
affecting substantial rights . . . although they were not 
brought to the attention of the court.”  We have noted, however, that the “power to deal with plain error is one to be exercised 
sparingly and with caution,” given that “the plain error 
rule . . . depart[s] from a presupposition of the adversary 
system – that a party must look to his or her counsel for 
protection and bear the cost of counsel’s mistakes.”  State v. 
Nichols, 111 Hawaiʻ i 327, 335, 141 P.3d 974, 982 (2006) (citation  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
21 
 and quotation omitted).    
IV.  DISCUSSION 
A. 
Issues Raised on Certiorari 
Engelby raises the following question on certiorari: 
Whether the ICA gravely erred in affirming the 
circuit court’s ruling allowing Dr. Bivens to testify 
because his testimony was (1) irrelevant and misleading; (2) stated “facts” or “characteristics” 
based on statistics (although not citing 
percentages); (3) improperly bolstered [Child]’ s and 
her mother’s credibility; (4) improperly profiled 
Engelby as a child molester; (5) taken in totality, was unduly prejudicial to Engelby; and (6) did not 
assist the jury in understanding the evidence 
[]because the evidence was logically comprehensible by jurors of common understanding, in violation of 
Engelby’s rights to due process and fair trial. 
 
B. The Issue of Children’s Credibility   
Engelby seeks to challenge the admission of statements 
made by Dr. Bivens concerning false allegations and 
suggestibility of children.  Since Engelby did not object at any 
time to that testimony while Dr. Bivens was testifying, we 
review for plain error.  
Dr. Bivens’ direct testimony did not address the 
credibility of alleged victims of child sexual abuse.  Rather, 
the defense raised that issue on cross-examination, apparently 
in order to suggest that Child’s memories of Engelby’s assaults 
were the result of suggestion.  To develop this theory, the 
defense sought to elicit testimony from Dr. Bivens that distinguished between a child’s propensity to make false 
allegations and a child’s susceptibility to suggestion.   
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
22 
 Dr. Bivens’ first statement about children’s 
credibility was made during cr
oss-examination, in response to 
the defense asking him how he would “distinguish compromised 
recall from a situation where . . . a child [would be] compelled 
to lie[.]”  The defense continued by asking Dr. Bivens to 
“comment on the phenomen[a] of rehearsal[, . . . ] implant[ing] 
a memory, or suggestibility[,]” to which Dr. Bivens replied, 
that in his experience, “[i]t [was] possible to implant a memory into a child’s mind.”  On re-cross examination, the defense 
emphasized this point by asking Dr. Bivens to “follow up on the 
suggestibility portion” of his testimony.  Indeed, on re-cross 
examination, this was the only topic broached.  It thus appears 
that the defense elicited this testimony to help develop its 
theory in closing that “[Child] may have been influenced by what 
someone else said or by[,] who knows, suggestion.”   
Moreover, the challenged testimony elicited by the 
State appears to align with the defense’s theory.  Dr. Bivens’ statement that “children independently are not likely to be 
sources of false allegations” did not bolster Child’s 
credibility where the defense’s theory was not that she was a 
liar by nature, but rather, that she was influenced to lie.   
The defense never objected to nor moved to strike the 
challenged portions of Dr. Bivens’ testimony at trial.  
Accordingly, Engelby did not properly preserve his claim about  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
23 
 bolstering, and waived his ability to challenge the statements 
under HRE Rule 103(a)(1), which states that “[e]rror may not be 
predicated upon a ruling which admits . . . evidence unless a 
substantial right of the party is affected, and . . . a timely 
objection or motion to strike appears on the record.”  (emphasis 
added).  See State v. Metcalfe, 129 Hawaiʻ i 206, 224, 297 P.3d 
1062, 1080 (2013) (point on appeal was forfeited because defense did not object to expert’s testimony at trial).  
While the defense challenged Dr. Bivens’ ability to 
testify as an expert witness in the Rule 104 hearing prior to 
his testimony, and claimed that his testimony would 
impermissibly bolster Child’s testimony, this general objection to his testimony was not sufficient to preserve his current 
objection to the statements about credibility now at issue.  See 
Kobashigawa v. Silva, 129 Hawaiʻ i 313, 322, 300 P.3d 579, 588 
(2013) (“[A]s is generally true for appellate review of any 
issue, the failure to object to evidence introduced after denial 
of a pretrial motion in limine to exclude that same evidence 
will result in waiver of the objection on appeal.”); State v. 
Kony, 138 Hawaiʻ i 1, 10-11, 375 P.3d 1239, 1248-49 (2016) 
(holding that defendant waived claims of improper profiling and 
expert’s use of statistical data when defendant only made 
general objections to expert’s testimony and failed to object to 
particular aspects of expert’s testimony at trial); cf. HRE Rule ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
24 103(a) (“Once the court makes a definitive ruling on the record 
admitting or excluding evidence, either at or before trial, a 
party need not renew an objection . . . to preserve a claim of 
error for appeal.”); Craft v. Peebles, 78 Hawai ʻi 287, 294, 893 
P.2d 138, 145 (1995) (“unequivocal” in limine rulings were  
noticeable on appeal despite failure to challenge at trial).  
Contrary to the dissent’s suggestion, it cannot be said that the  
circuit court made “definitive ” pretrial rulings with regard to  
this testimony.  See Dissent at 11-12.
Thus, in order to preserve his claims about bolstering 
in relation to Dr. Bivens’ statements about children’s 
credibility, Engelby was required to (1) object to Dr. Bivens’ 
statements at the time they were made, or (2) move to strike 
those statements later, specifically on the ground that they 
improperly addressed the credibility of child witnesses.  
Because Engelby did neither, he did not properly preserve his 
claims, and plain error review applies.  See HRE Rule 103(d) 
(this court may take notice of “plain errors affecting 
substantial rights” even if “they were not brought to the 
attention of the court”); see also Addison M. Bowman, Hawai ʻi 
Rules of Evidence Manual § 103-4[2] (2018-19 ed.) (“Evidence 
admitted without any objection . . . is reviewable on appeal 
only as plain error.”).

 C. 
Under Plain Error Review, Engelby’s Substantial Rights Were 
Not Affected 
 
Our case law acknowledges that expert psychological 
testimony in child sexual abuse cases often has the effect of 
bolstering one witness’s credibility at the expense of another’s, and that this, on its own, is permissible if it does 
not unduly prejudice the defendant.  Kony, 138 Hawaiʻ i at 11, 375 
P.3d at 1249 (citing State v. Batangan, 71 Haw. 552, 557-58, 799 
P.2d 48, 51-52 (1990)).  We have recognized, however, that 
courts must proceed with caution in admitting this type of 
testimony.  The testimony may not, for instance, directly opine, 
or have the same “effect . . . as directly opining on the 
truthfulness of the complaining witness,” as that would usurp the basic function of the jury.  Batangan, 71 Haw. at 559, 799 
P.2d at 52 (quoting State v. Myers, 382 N.W.2d 91, 97 (Iowa 
1986)) (emphasis added). 
It is significant that, here, the State never 
mentioned Dr. Bivens’ challenged testimony in its closing argument.  And, while not dispositive to the issue of 
bolstering, it is also significant that Dr. Bivens had never met 
or spoken with any of the case’s witnesses, and that he was 
unfamiliar with the case’s details.  Compare State v. McDonnell, 
141 Hawaiʻ i 280, 293, 409 P.3d 684, 697 (2017) (holding that Dr. 
Bivens’ statements in that case did not have the effect of  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
26 
 directly opining on the complaining witness’s veracity, in part, 
because Dr. Bivens was not familiar with any facts of the case 
and had not spoken to any of the witnesses) with Batangan, 71 
Haw. at 555, 799 P.2d at 50 (holding that the expert witness improperly vouched for the victim’s credibility when he 
testified on the prosecution’s behalf after evaluating the 
complaining witness) and State v. Morris, 72 Haw. 527, 529, 825 
P.2d 1051, 1052 (1992) (holding that the expert witness 
impermissibly bolstered the complaining witness’s credibility 
even though they had never met because the court concluded that 
the expert’s “opinion had to have been based on the child’s 
statements to others”).    
Additionally, the risk of prejudice to Engelby was 
reduced by the circuit court’s instructions to the jurors on how 
much weight to give each witness’s testimony, and our court’s 
recognition that usurpation of the jury’s function can be 
avoided, in part, with jury instructions.  See McDonnell, 141 
Hawaiʻi at 293, 409 P.3d at 697 (citing State v. Sawyer, 88 
Hawaiʻi 325, 329 n.7, 966 P.2d 637, 641 n.7 (1998) (noting that 
juries are presumed to adhere to a court’s instructions)).  In McDonnell, for instance, we determined that Dr. Bivens’ 
testimony was not prejudicial, because, inter alia: 
the jury was instructed that they were to decide how 
much weight to give Dr. Bivens’ testimony: “Merely 
because such a witness has expressed an opinion does 
not mean . . . that you must accept this opinion.  It  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
27 
 is up to you to decide whether to accept this 
testimony and how much weight to give it.”   
 
Id. (emphasis added). 
It is thus significant that the jury in Engelby’s case 
received the same instruction on weighing credibility as the 
jury in McDonnell.  See id.  Specifically, the jury was given 
the following instructions: 
COURT:  During the trial you heard the testimony of 
one or more witnesses who were described as experts.  
Training and experience may make a person an expert 
in a particular field.  The law allows that person to 
state an opinion about matters in that field. 
 
Merely because a witness has expressed an opinion 
does not mean, however, that you must accept this 
opinion.  It is up to you to decide whether to accept 
this testimony and how much weight to give it.  You 
must also decide whether the witness’s opinions were based on sound reasons, judgment and information.  
 
 
(emphasis added).   
Here, the jury was also presented with ample evidence 
to independently assess Child’s credibility.  In addition to 
hearing from Child, the jury heard testimony from Child’s 
sister, Child’s mother, and Child’s mother’s boyfriend, all of 
whom corroborated many aspects of Child’s testimony.   
Child’s sister, for instance, testified that Engelby 
would come over a lot, sleep over, and sometimes lay down in the bedroom she shared with Child, while Child’s mother explained 
that Engelby was “welcome to come and go as he pleased.”  And, 
although Engelby denied visiting Child’s home on the night of 
the last alleged incident, both Child’s mother and her boyfriend  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
28 
 testified to the contrary.  The mother’s boyfriend also 
testified that he had seen Engelby in Child’s room that night, 
at some time between 12:30 and 2:00 a.m., laying down and 
illuminated by his cell phone.   
Furthermore, Dr. Bivens’ testimony was helpful to the 
jury in understanding aspects of Child’s behavior that might 
otherwise seem inexplicable to a lay juror.  In Batangan, we 
were persuaded that the expert witness had impermissibly 
bolstered the complaining witness’s credibility, in part, 
because the expert’s “testimony regarding general principles of 
social or behavioral science of a child victim in a sexual abuse 
case was so minuscule, [that] we [were] convinced that his 
testimony could not have assisted the jury” in understanding the general dynamics of child sexual assault.  71 Haw. at 562, 799 
P.2d at 54 (emphasis added).  We continued by explaining: 
In fact, Dr. Bond several times asked the jury to 
recall their own childhood days and suggested that 
Complainant’s actions were actions of normal children 
under similar circumstances.  When queried about 
retractions of accusations – a common behavior 
recognized as unique to intrafamily sex abuse – Dr. 
Bond admitted that he lacked data on the subject.  
Id.  
In contrast to the expert witness in Batangan, whose 
testimony could not be construed as helpful to a jury, here, Dr. 
Bivens provided extensive testimony about the topics he was 
explicitly authorized to discuss pursuant to the circuit court’s 
rulings, including the topics of delayed reporting, tunnel  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
29 
 memory, and children’s reactions to sexual assault events.   
Moreover, to the extent Dr. Bivens went beyond those 
subjects in discussing children’s general credibility, he did so 
only after Engelby inquired about that issue during cross-
examination.  If Engelby believed Dr. Bivens’ answers on cross-
examination were non-responsive or otherwise inappropriate, he 
should have objected and moved to strike those answers.  
Similarly, when Dr. Bivens responded to additional questions on re-direct examination, Engelby should have objected if he 
believed the questions or responses exceeded the scope of his 
cross-examination or were otherwise inappropriate.   
C. 
Engelby’s Other Claims of Error 
With respect to the remaining issues raised by 
Engelby, we addressed similar issues in State v. McDonnell, a 
case that was pending before this court at the time Engelby 
applied for certiorari.  141 Hawaiʻ i 280, 409 P.3d 684.  
McDonnell involved a defendant who sexually assaulted his minor 
daughter in their home over a period of several months.  See id.  
We held that Dr. Bivens’ testimony on the general dynamics of 
child sexual assault was admissible because it “helped explain 
the interaction between [the complaining witness] and [the 
defendant], and its probative value outweighed its prejudicial 
effect.”  Id. at 283, 409 P.3d at 687.   
Specifically, we held that Dr. Bivens’ testimony on  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
30 
 delayed and incomplete disclosure, tunnel memory, and the 
general abuse process was relevant; that Dr. Bivens’ testimony 
explaining the behaviors of child sexual assault victims did not 
usurp the function of the jury or unduly prejudice the 
defendant; and that Dr. Bivens’ testimony on the general process 
of child sexual assault did not improperly profile the defendant 
as a child molester.  Id. at 290-98, 409 P.3d at 694-702.   
In accord with our reasoning in McDonnell, we reject 
Engelby’s other claims of error.  Dr. Bivens’ testimony – which, as in McDonnell, discussed delayed disclosure, tunnel memory, 
the general abuse process, and behaviors of child sexual assault victims – was both relevant and helpful to the jury, and neither 
usurped the function of the jury nor resulted in undue 
prejudice.  Furthermore, although Dr. Bivens’ testimony included 
general quantitative assertions, such as sexual abuse “most 
often” occurs in a preexisting nonsexual relationship and “most 
often” in the home of the child or the abuser, such testimony did not improperly profile Engelby as a molester.  See 
McDonnell, 141 Hawaiʻ i at 297, 409 P.3d at 701 (explaining that 
“Dr. Bivens could have testified generally that abusers are 
often related to their victims and that such abuse normally 
occurs in the home”).7 
                                                 
7 Dr. Bivens’ testimony here is therefore distinguishable from his  
  
        (continued…)

 V.  CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the ICA’s 
judgment on appeal, and affirm Engelby’s convictions and 
sentence.

had a preexisting relationship with the child, and that two studies showed 
that “100 percent of incest offenders report molesting in their own home.”   
141 Hawaiʻi at 297, 409 P.3d at 701.  We held that such testimony was unfairly 
prejudicial to the defendant because it carried the risk of improperly 
profiling the defendant as a child molester, but that it was harmless in 
light of the proceedings as a whole.
