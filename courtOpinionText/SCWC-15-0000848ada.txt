OPINION OF THE COURT BY WILSON, J.  3
 
  This case addresses whether the Honolulu Police 
Department’s (“HPD”) seizure of seventy-seven Product Direct 
Sweepstakes (“PDS”) machines and the Office of the Prosecuting 
Attorney’s subsequent petition for administrative forfeiture 
comported with  Hawai‘i=s civil forfeiture statute, Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (“HRS”) Ch apter 712A.  In September 2012, HPD began 
seizing PDS machines from six Winner’z Zone locations because it 
deemed the machines to be in violation of Hawaiʻi’s gambling 
                                                 
2   CAAP-15-0000848, CAAP -15-0000849, CAAP -15-0000850,  
CAAP-15-0000852, CAAP -15-0000854, and CAAP -15-0000855 were previously 
consolidated in the Intermediate Court of Appeals  (“ICA”) under CAAP -15-
0000848.

  statutes.4  The machines remained in police custody for nearly 
two years.  During that time, HPD did not initiate forfeiture 
proceedings pursuant to HRS § 712A -7(3) (1991)5, did not give 
notice of the seizure of forfeiture to all parties known to have 
an interest in the property  and did not provide the prosecutors 
a written request for forfeiture as required  by HRS §712A-7(4) 
                                                 
 4  The relevant gambling statutes are HRS  §§ 712-1222 and 712 -1226 
(1991).  HRS § 712-1222 provides:  
 
(1) A person commits the offense of promoting 
gambling in the second degree if the person knowingly 
advances or profits from gambling activity.  
 
(2) Promoting gambling in the second degree is 
a misdemeanor.  
 
HRS § 712-1226 provides:  
 
(1) A person commits the off ense of possession  
of a gambling device if the person manufactures, 
sells, transports, places, possesses, or conducts or 
negotiates any transaction affecting or designed to 
affect ownership, custody, or use of any gambling 
device, knowing it is to be used in the advancement 
of gambling activity which is not social gambling.  
 
(2) Possession of a gambling device is a 
misdemeanor.  
 
5  HRS § 712A-7(3) provides:  
 
As soon as practicable after seizure for 
forfeiture, the seizing agency shall conduct an 
inventory and estimate the value of the 
property seized. Within twenty days after 
seizure for forfeiture  the seizing agency shall 
make reasonable efforts to give  notice of 
seizure for for feiture in the manner provided 
in section 712A -8(a) or 712A -8(b) to all 
parties known to have an interest in the seized 
property.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

  (1991).6  Instead, in September 2014, HPD “re -seized” the 
machines for forfeiture and began forfeiture proceedings.  
Forfeiture proceedings were initiated on September 22,  2014, by 
the prosecutor’s office.  
We hold that a seizing agency’s failure to commence 
forfeiture proceedings according to the specific timing 
requirements set forth in HRS §§ 712A -7 and 712A -97 (1991) 
requires the agency to return the seized property.  
 
  
                                                 
6  HRS § 712A-7(4) provides : 
 
(4) In the event of a seizure for forfeiture under section 
712A-6, the seizing agency shall send to a prosecuting attorney a 
written request for forfeiture within thirty days, which shall 
include a statement of f acts and circumstances of the seizure, 
the appraised or estimated value of the property, and a summary 
of the facts relied on for forfeiture.  
 
7  HRS § 712A-9 provides in relevant part:  
 
(1)  The prosecuting attorney shall determine whether it is 
probable that the property is subject to forfeiture and, if so, 
shall initiate administrative or judicial proceedings against the 
property within forty -five days of receipt of a written request 
for forfeiture from a seizing agency. If, on inquiry and 
examination, t he prosecuting attorney determines, with sole 
discretion, that the proceedings probably cannot be sustained or 
that justice does not require the institution of proceedings, the 
prosecuting attorney shall notify the seizing agency, and as soon 
as practicabl e authorize the release of the seizure for 
forfeiture on the property or on any specified interest in it. A 
determination by the prosecuting attorney to forego initiation of 
proceedings shall not be a bar to initiation of proceedings 
against the same prope rty based on the same circumstances at a 
later time.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

  I. Background  
A.  Factual Background  
On September 26, 2012, HPD obtained a search warrant 
to search six Winner’z Zone business locations for property held 
in violation of Hawaiʻi’s gambling statutes , HRS §§ 712-1222 and 
712-1226.  The following day, on September 27, 2012, HPD began 
executing the search warrant at each location.  HPD seized 
seventy-seven PDS machines, in addition to other items it deemed 
violated Hawaiʻi’s gambling statutes  that was authorized by the 
search warrant . 
The PDS machines remained in HPD custody for nearly 
two years before HPD began forfeiture proceedings.  HPD 
cancelled the investigation for the initial HPD report number 
that documented the seizur e for forfeiture “[d]ue to time 
constraints.”  After the investigation was cancelled, the 
machines remained in police custody.  On September 12, 2014 , a 
new HPD report number was issued by HPD stating that the PDS 
machines were re -seized for forfeiture.8  
                                                 
 8  The Prosecuting Attorney asserted in the Petition for 
Administrative Forfeiture filed with the Department of Attorney General on 
September 22, 2014, that HPD cancelled its 2012 investigation (HPD re port 
number 12 -351453) due to time constraints and that the property was re -seized 
under HPD report number 14 -332134. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

(continued . . .)  
   Seven days later, on September 19, 2014, HPD sent a 
request for forfeiture to the Office of the City and County of 
Honolulu Prosecuting Attorney (“prosecutor’s office”).  On 
September 22, 2014, pursuant to HRS § 712A -9, the prosecutor’s 
office began admin istrative forfeiture proceedings by filing a 
petition for administrative forfeiture with the Department of 
the Attorney General.   Petitioner/Appellee -Claimant, PJY 
Enterprises, LLC (“PJY”) challenged the seizure on November 3, 
2014,9 by filing a claim to the seized property and a request for 
judicial review of administrative forfeiture.10  
                                                 
 9  PJY previously challenged the seizure on October 12, 2012, by 
filing a complaint for declaratory judgment, injunct ive relief, and monetary 
damages against HPD in the circuit court.  That case was removed to federal 
court.  On April 30, 2014, the federal court granted a motion for summary 
judgment in favor of the Prosecuting Attorney, finding that the PDS machines 
constituted gam bling devices under the Hawaii gambling statutes.  
  
 10  HRS § 712A-10(9)(1991) provides that an individual claiming 
seized property may request judicial review of a forfeiture:  
 
(9) Any person claiming seized property may seek 
judicial review of the seizu re and proposed 
forfeiture by timely filing with the attorney general 
a claim and bond to the State . . . .  In lieu of a 
cost bond, a claimant may file an in pauperis bond 
sworn on oath before a notary public  . . . .  Upon 
receipt of the claim and bond, t he attorney general 
shall notify the prosecuting attorney who may 
discretionarily continue to seek forfeiture by 
petitioning the circuit court for forfeiture of the 
property within forty -five days of receipt of notice 
that a proper claim and bond has been filed.  The 
prosecuting attorney may also elect to honor the 
claim in which case the prosecuting attorney shall 
notify the seizing agency and authorize the release *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

(continued . . .)  
   In response to PJY =s request for judicial review of the 
forfeiture, on December 19, 2014, the prosecutor’s office began 
judicial forfeiture proceedings by filing a veri fied petition 
for forfeiture in the circuit court  pursuant to HRS § 712A -9.  
In the petition  for forfeiture , the prosecutor’s office asserted 
that “the subject property was initially seized for forfeiture 
on or about September 27, 2012” and then “re -seized for 
forfeiture on or about September 12, 2014” .  It was also 
asserted that the  seized property was subject to forfeiture 
because the property was used in the commission of a covered 
offense.  The prosecutor’s office requested that the property be 
distributed to the attorney general  in accordance with  
HRS § 712A -16(2) (2003).11  PJY filed a motion to dismiss the 
verified petition for forfeiture.  The prosecutor’s office 
opposed the motion.  
                                                                                                                                                             
(. . . continued) 
 
of the seizure for forfeiture on the property or on 
any specified interest in it.  
 
 11  Forfeited property is distributed according to HRS § 712A-16(2): 
 
(2)  All forfeited property and the sale proceeds 
thereof, up to a maximum of three million dollars per 
year, not previously transferred pursuant to 
[subsection] (1)(a) of thi s section, shall, after 
payment of expenses of administration and sale, be 
distributed as follows:  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

. . . . 
 
 
(continued . . .)  
 The Circuit Court of the First Circuit (“circuit 
court”) granted P JY =s motion to dismiss the verified petition for 
forfeiture and granted in part PJY’s alternative motion for 
summary judgment.12  The circuit court dismissed the verified 
petition because the prosecutor’s office failed to comply with 
the time limitations un der HRS § 712A -1713 and HRS § 701 -108(2).14  
                                                                                                                                                             
(. . . continued) 
 
(a) One quarter shall be distributed to the 
unit or units of state or local government 
[whose] officers or employees conducted the 
investigation and caused the arrest of the 
person whose property was forfeited or seizure 
of the property for forfeiture;  
 
(b) One quarter shall be distributed to the  
prosecuting attorney who instituted the action 
producing the forfeiture; and  
 
(c) One half shall be deposited into  the 
criminal forfeiture fund established by this 
chapter.  
 
12  The Honorable Randal K.O. Lee presided.  
 
13 HRS § 712A-17 provides:    
 
“Notwithstanding any other provision of law, forfeiture proceedings 
under this chapter may be commenced at any time within th e period in 
which a criminal proceeding may be instituted for a covered offense 
pursuant to section 701 -108.” 
 
14  HRS § 701-108(2)(e) provides:  
 
(2) Except as otherwise provided in this section, 
prosecutions for other offenses are subject to the 
following p eriods of limitation:  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 The circuit court also granted summary judgment in part after 
concluding that there was no genuine issue of material fact as 
to the prosecutor’s office’s violation of this time limitation 
under HRS § 7 01-108(2) and that PJY was entitled to a judgment 
as a matter of law.  The State appealed.  
B.  ICA Decision  
The ICA vacated the circuit court ’s decision and 
remanded for further proceedings.  According to the ICA, the 
circuit court incorrectly interp reted Chapter 712A to require 
that both the administrative petition and the judicial petition 
be filed within the two -year statute of limitations delineated 
in HRS § 712A -17.  The ICA held that although the Prosecutor 
failed to file the judicial petition within the two-year statute 
of limitations , the petition was nevertheless timely because the 
administrative petition was filed within the statu te of 
limitations.  Under this analysis, the  ICA held that where a 
prosecuting attorney  files a qualifying claim  for forfeiture  
pursuant to HRS § 712A -9 and requests judicial review of an 
administrative petition, the prosecuting attorney may 
                                                                                                                                                             
(. . . continued) 
 
(e) A prosecution for a petty misdemeanor or 
parking violation must be commenced within two 
years after it is committed [.] *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
 
 
 10 “discretionarily continue to seek forfeiture by petitioning the 
circuit court for forfeiture of the propert y[.]”  HRS § 712A -
10(10) pro vides that “no duplicate or repetitive notice shall be 
required .  The judicial proceeding, if any, shall adjudicate all 
timely claims.”  Reading these two provisions together, the ICA 
held that the judicial proceeding is a continuation of a 
preexisting  administrative  proceeding pursuant to HRS § 712A -
9(1) and “bringing the administrative petition within the 
statute of limitations period satisfies that requirement.”  
Having determined that the prosecut ing attorney  did 
not violate the statute of limitation s, the ICA considered the 
timing requirements of HRS §§ 712A -7 and 712A -9.  As interpreted 
by the ICA, these provisions require HPD to send a request for 
forfeiture to the prosecuting attorney within thirty days of 
seizure and require the prosecuting attor ney to determine 
whether the property is likely subject to forfeiture  pursuant to 
HRS § 712A -5 and, if so, to file the petition  for forfeiture  
within forty -five days of the request.  The ICA asserted that 
the first seizure by HPD occurred on September 27, 2012; 
accordingly the ICA concluded  that HPD failed to meet these 
statutory deadlines mandated by HRS §§ 712A -7 and 712A -9 because 
HPD failed to make reasonable efforts to give notice of seizure 
within twenty days to all parties who were known to have an *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
 
11 
 
  
(continued . . .)  
 interest in the seized property.15  However, the ICA ruled that 
the failure of HPD to file petitions to begin forfeiture 
proceedings within forty -five days in accordance with HRS §§ 
712A-7 and 712A -9 was not sanctionable because those provisions 
do not provide p enalties for their violation. The ICA held that 
“failure to comply with the internal deadlines contained in HRS 
§ 712A will not serve as a bar for [a] petition brought within 
the limitation provision continued in HRS § 712A -17.” 
 Pursuant to HRS § 712A-17, forfeiture proceedings 
must be commenced within the statute of limitations to file the 
covered offense .  In the present case, the covered offenses were 
misdemeanors.  Therefore, prosecution must have commenced within 
two-years pursuant to HRS § 701-108(2)(e).  The ICA thus 
concluded that the two -year statute of limitations contained in 
HRS § 712A -17--rather than the statutory deadlines contained in 
HRS §§ 712A -7(3)16 and 712A -9(1)17--establish the time by which 
                                                 
15  If September 27, 2012 is the seizure for forfeiture date, HPD 
took the actions required pursuant t o HRS § 712A-7 and HRS § 712A-9 nearly 
two years after the seizure  by notifying the prosecutor’s office.   On 
September 19, 2014, a request for forfeiture was sent to the prosecuting 
attorney.  The prosecut or’s office  filed a petition for administrative 
forfeiture on September 22, 2014.  
  
16  HRS § 712 A-7 provides:  
 
(3) . . . Within twenty days after seizure for 
forfeiture the seizing agency shall make reasonable *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
 
12 
 
  HPD and the prosecutor’s office must initiate forfeiture 
actions.  The ICA relied on  United States v. James Daniel Good 
Real Prop. , 510 U.S. 43 (1993).  In Good, the United States  
Supreme Court found that, because the customs statute containing 
forfeiture timing requirements did not p rovide a remedy for the 
government’s noncompliance, and because a statute of limitations 
already existed to prevent stale claims from being brought, the 
customs statute’s forfeiture timing requirements were simply 
internal timing requirements that could no t be enforced by the 
Court.  510 U.S. at 65.  The ICA found HRS Ch. 712A to be  
analogous  to the customs statute at issue in Good.  The ICA 
                                                                                                                                                             
(. . . continued) 
 
efforts to give notice of seizure for forfeiture in 
the manner provided in section 712A -8(a) or 712 -8(b) 
to all parties known to have an interest in the 
seized property.  
 
(4) In the event of a seizure for forfeiture under 
section 712 -6, the seizing agency shall send to a 
prosecuting attorney a written request for forfeiture 
within thirty days, which shall include a statement 
of facts and circumstances of the seizure, the 
appraised or estimated value of the property, and a 
summary of the facts relied on for forfeiture.  
 
17  HRS § 712 A-9(1) provides:  
 
“The prosecuting attorney shall determine whether it is 
probable that the property is subject to forfeiture and, if 
so, shall initia te administrative or judicial proceedings 
against the property within forty -five days of receipt of a 
written request for forfeiture from a seizing agency  . . .” 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
 
13 
 
   stated that HRS Ch. 712A similarly lacks a remedy for 
noncompliance with the forfeiture timing requirements, and also  
provides a statute of limitations to prevent stale claims.  The 
ICA characterized HRS §§ 712A -7 and 712A -9 as providing 
unenforceable internal timing requirements analogous to the 
customs statute in Good.  Accordingly,  the ICA concluded  that 
the circuit court erred in its application of the time 
limitations of Section 712A -7 and 712A -9 to the September 27, 
2012, seizure by HPD.   The ICA vacated the circuit court’s order 
granting PJY Enterprises, LLC’s motion to dismiss the verified 
petition for forfeiture  and/or in the alternative granting PJY’s 
Enterprises, LLC’s motion for summary judgment.  Further, the 
ICA vacated  the final judgment of the circuit court dated 
October 8, 2015 dismissing the case  and remanded for further 
proceedings . 
II. Standard of Review  
The interpretati on of a statute is a question of law 
reviewable de novo.  
 
When construing a statute, our foremost 
obligation is to ascertain and give effect to 
the intention of the legislature, which is to 
be obtained primarily from the language 
contained in the statute i tself.  And we must 
read statutory language in the context of the 
entire statute and construe it in a manner 
consistent with its purpose.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

omitted) (quoting Amantiad v. Odum , 90 Hawaii 152, 160, 977 P.2d 
160, 168 (1999)).  
III. Discussion  
HPD seized PJY’s seventy-seven machines on September 
27, 2012 , and took no action to inform Petitioner of the 
seizure, or request the prosecutor’s office  to seek forfeiture 
until it sent a request for forfeiture to the prosecutor ’s 
office on September 19, 2014 --nearly two years after the initial 
seizure.18  The ICA relied upon HRS § 712A -17 to conclude that 
the sole time limitation on the government’s use of forfeitu re 
is the statute of limitation applicable to the offense for which 
the forfeited evidence is to be used.  HRS § 712A -17 states in 
pertinent part:  “Notwithstanding any other provision of law, 
forfeiture proceedings under this chapter may be commenced at 
any time within the period in which a criminal proceeding may be 
instituted for a covered offense pursuant to section 701 -108.” 
Under this analysis, the time limitations contained  in 
HRS §§ 712A -7(4) or 712A -9(1) become merely internal deadlines 
                                                 
 18    The prosecuting attorney  consequently  did not initiate forfeiture 
proceedings until Septem ber 22, 2014 . *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
 
15 
 
 with no prescr iptive effect.   PJY would have no recourse for  the 
return of its property until the expiration of the two-year 
statute of limitations applicable to the underlying offense s of 
Gambling in the Second Degree in violation HRS § 712-1222 and 
Possession of a Gamblin g Device in violation of HRS § 712-1226. 
Thus, the failure of HPD , as the “seizing agency” to “make 
reasonable efforts to give notice of seizure for forfeiture  . .

and to “send to a prosecuting  attorney a written request for 
forfeiture within thirty days ” after the property was  seized, 
pursuant to  HRS § 712A -7(4); and the failure of the prosecuting 
attorney to “initiate administrative or judicial proceedings 
against the property within forty -five days” of receipt of HPD’s 
request for forfeiture,  pursuant to HRS § 712A -9(1) are of no 
consequence to the continued deprivation of PJY’s property by 
HPD. 
The legislative history of  HRS Chapter 712A 
contradicts  the ICA’s proposition that  legislative intent was  to 
render unenforceable the  forfeiture deadlines set forth in HRS 
§§ 712A-7 and 712A -9.  In 1991, the l egislature reinstated the 
timing requirements of HRS § 712A-9 to “require[] the prosecutor 
to initiate forfeiture proceedings within forty -five days of 
receipt of written request for forfeiture or to return the *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 property seized. ”  S. Stan. Comm. Rep. No. 1049, in 1991 Senate 
Journal, at 1117.19  In so doing, the legislature made explicit 
its intent that the remedy for noncompliance with HRS § 712A-9’s 
deadlines was the return of the property.  
That the l egislature intended the remedy for 
noncompliance with the timing deadlines of forfeiture to be the 
return of the property is further supported by  the deadlines 
applicable to an individual claimin g an interest in forfeited 
property.  Pursuant to  HRS § 712A-10(4), a claim  of interest  
must be made within thirty days of notice of the seizure.20  HRS 
                                                 
19  In 1988 the legislature enacted Act 260 which amended HRS § 712A -
9(1) to state : 
 
The prosecuting attorney shall determine 
whether it is probable that the property is subject 
to forfeiture and, if so, may cause the initiation of 
administrative or j udicial proceedings against the 
property.  If, on inquiry and examination, the 
prosecuting attorney determines that the proceedings 
probably cannot be sustained or that j ustice does not 
require the  institution of such proceedings, the 
prosecuting attorney shall notify the seizing agency, 
and as soon as practicable authorize  the release of 
the seizure for forfeiture on the property or on any 
specified interest in it.   
 
1988 Haw.  Sess. Laws Act 260, § 9 at 461. 
 
 20  HRS § 712A-10(4) provides in relevant part:  
 
 Persons claiming an interest in the property 
may file either a petit ion for remission or 
mitigation of forfeiture, or a claim and cost or in 
pauperis bond, but not both, with the attorney *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 § 712A-10(4) does not explicitly  prohibit a claim of interest  
after the thirty day deadline; however, it  would be contrary to 
the intended purpose of the dead line to conclude that the State 
would not be subject to a claim of interest on the forfeited 
property until after the thirty day limitation  stated in HRS § 
712A-10(4).  Similarly, the logical consequenc e of the State’s 
failure to commence forfeiture proceedings within the deadlines 
delineated in HRS §§ 712A-721 and 712A-922 is the return of seized  
property .  
Finally, the ICA’s reliance by on the United States  
Supreme Court’s decision in Good to conclude that the deadlines 
enumerated in  HRS § 712A-7 and § 712A-9 are internal deadlines  
and failure to comply with these deadlines “will not serve as a 
bar for a petition [for forfeiture]”  is misplaced .  In Good, 
because the customs statute at issue did not provide a rem edy

prosecuting attorney “shall initiate administrative or judicial proceedings

 for failure to comply with the provision, the Court interpreted 
the statute to be an internal guideline rather than one 
enforceable by the courts.  510 U.S. at 64 -65.  The Court 
explained that, because the statute lacked a consequence for 
noncompliance , Congress impliedly left enforcement to the 
administering officials.  Here, the legislative history of HRS § 
712A-9 explicitly provides that the seizing agency must return 
the seized property if the State fails to follow HRS § 712A-9.   
IV. Conclusion  
In conclusion, the failure of HPD and the Prosecutor 
to comply with the  twenty day and forty -five day  statutory 
deadlines  contained in HRS §§ 712A -7 and 712A -9 applicable to 
seizure of Petitioner’s property  require its return.  
Accordingly , we vacate the ICA ’s July 31, 2017 Judgment on 
Appeal, and remand the case to the circuit court for further 
proceedings consistent with this opinion.
