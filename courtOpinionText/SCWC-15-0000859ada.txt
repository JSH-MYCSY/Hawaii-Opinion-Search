2 2The PDPS was developed by the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration “to provide a centralized repository of information on 
individuals whose privilege to operate a motor vehicle have been revoked, 
suspended, cancelled, denied, or who have been convicted of serious traffic -
related offenses.”  U.S. Dept. of Trans., National Driver Registry (NDR) 
Problem Driver Pointer System (PDPS) PIA, 
https://www.transportation.gov/individuals/privacy/national -driver-registry-
ndr-problem- driver-pointer-system-pdps-pia.  (Wolcott) appeals from the judgment and order of the District Court of the First Circuit (district court) 
affirming the administrative revocation of his driver’s license by a hearing officer of the 
Administrative Driver’s License Revocation Office (the ADLRO) for a period of ten years.  The 
ADLRO sustained the automatic revocation of Wolcott’s driver’s license for ten years based on its 
determination that Wolcott was subject to a mandatory ten-year revocation period for the offense of 
operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant (OVUII) because Wolcott had three or more 
prior alcohol enforcement contacts.
In its written decision, the ADLRO found that Wolcott had a total of four prior alcohol enforcement 
contacts, based on a driving history abstract obtained by the ADLRO from the Problem Driver 
Pointer System [PDPS Abstract).   The ADLRO provided Wolcott with a copy of the PDPS Abstract in 
the form of a ten-page computer print-out prior to his hearing.  The PDPS Abstract indicated that 
Wolcott had a total of four prior alcohol enforcement contacts: two in Hawaiʻi, which Wolcott2***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
3 conceded, and two in Oregon, which Wolcott claimed to have no
knowledge of.    
Wolcott appealed to the Intermediate Court of Appeals 
(ICA) and argued that (1) the district court erred in holding 
that the ADLRO was not required to lay foundation to admit the 
PDPS Abstract into evidence; and (2) the ADLRO failed to provide
notice as what the PDPS Abstract actually was or where it 
originated until after the hearing.  The ICA affirmed.  
In his application for writ of certiorari, Wolcott 
maintains that the ADLRO was required to lay foundation to admit
the PDPS Abstract and that he was denied due process because the
PDPS Abstract that he received 
in discovery was untitled, failed
to identify its source, and used codes without any explanation 
of their meaning.  Wolcott argues that the PDPS Abstract failed 
to provide him with adequate notice of the Oregon alcohol 
enforcement contacts and a meaningful opportunity to respond
 at 
the hearing.   
 
 
Due process requires that Wolcott have a “meaningful 
opportunity” to challenge  the revocation of his driver’s 
license, which is a constitutionally protected property 
interest.  The procedures that the ADLRO implemented in this 
case, namely, sending Wolcott 
a cryptic and unclear computer 
printout, failed to provide him with adequate 
notice of the two  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
4 (continued. . .)  Oregon alcohol enforcement contacts and denied him a meaningful
opportunity to respond.  Thus, the ADLRO erroneously considered
the two Oregon alcohol enforcement contacts in determining the 
length of his revocation period because Wolcott
 was not able to
challenge those convictions at the revocation hearing.  
 
 
For the reasons stated herein, we hold that the 
procedures used by the ADLRO in this case denied  Wolcott due 
process.  Had the ADLRO considered only Wolcott’s two prior 
alcohol enforcement contacts in Hawai ʻi, the mandatory revocation
period would have been four years.  
Accordingly, we affirm the 
ICA’s June 25, 2019 judgment on appeal, except that part of the 
judgment relating to the additional revocation period for having
three or more prior alcohol enforcement contacts.  We vacate the
ICA’s judgment on appeal relating to the additional six-year 
revocation period and remand to the ADLRO in accordance with our
decision herein.  
 
 
 
II. BACKGROUND
On August 14, 2014, Wolcott was arrested for OVUII
pursuant to Hawai ʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E
-61(a).   3 
3HRS § 291E- 61(a) (Supp. 2014) provides in relevant part,  
Operating a vehicle under the influence of an 
intoxicant.   (a) A person commits the offense of operating
a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the 
person operates or assumes actual physical control of a 
vehicle:  
 
***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
5 Wolcott refused to submit to a blood or breath test for the
purpose of determining alcohol concentration.  
Wolcott was advised of the consequences for refusing
to take a blood or breath test.   He was specifically informed: 
 
If you refuse to take any tests and your record to operate
a vehicle shows three or more prior alcohol or drug 
enforcement contacts during the ten years preceding the 
date the notice of administrative revocation was issued, 
your license and privilege to operate a vehicle will be 
revoked for ten years.   
 
Wolcott was also informed that an “alcohol enforcement contact”
means: 4 
a. Any administrative revocation ordered pursuant to  
                                                 
(1) While under the influence of alcohol in an
amount sufficient to impair the person’s n ormal mental
faculties or ability to care for the person and guard 
against casualty;   
 
 
. . . . 
 
(3) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two
hundred ten liters of breath[.]   
 
4 Wolcott’s advisory mirrors HRS § 291E -1 (Supp. 2012), which provides in
relevant part:  
 
“Alcohol enforcement contact” means:  
(1) Any administrative revocation ordered pursuant 
to part III;  
(2) Any administrative revocation ordered pursuant
to part XIV of chapter 286, as that part was in effect on 
or before December 31, 2001;   
 
. . . . 
 
(4) Any conviction in this State for operating or 
being in physical control of a vehicle while having an 
unlawful alcohol concentration or while under the influence 
of alcohol; or  
(5) Any conviction in any other state or federal 
jurisdiction for an offense that is comparable to operating 
or being in physical control of a vehicle while having an 
unlawful alcohol concentration or while under the influence 
of alcohol.  
  
 
***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
6 part III of chapter 291E, HRS.  
 
. . . . 
d. Any conviction in this State for operating or being
in physical control of a vehicle while having an 
unlawful alcohol concentration or drug content or 
while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.   
e. A conviction in any other state or federal 
jurisdiction for an offense that is comparable to 
operating or being in physical control of a vehicle 
while having an unlawful alcohol concentration or 
unlawful drug content or while under the influence of
alcohol or drugs.   
 
Wolcott signed and acknowledged that he understood 
these sanctions.  Based on Wolcott’s arrest and refusal to 
submit to a blood or breath test, the ADLRO issued a Notice of
Administrative Revocation on August 20, 2014.  
The ADLRO conducted an administrative paper review of 
Wolcott’s case and on August 21, 2014, mailed a Notice of 
Administrative Review Decision to Wolcott, informing  him that 
his driver’s license woul d be revoked for a period of ten years.  
Wolcott requested an administrative review hearing.  
On June 8, 2015, Wolcott appeared with counsel at  a license 
revocation hearing (the hearing) before an ADLRO hearing 
officer.   At the hearing, Wolcott’s counsel asked the hearing 
officer to explain why the ADLRO revoked Wolcott’s license for 
ten years.  Counsel stated that he was aware that Wolcott had 
two prior alcohol enforcement contacts in Hawaiʻi, but could not
find a third prior alcohol enforcement contact which would 5

7 (continued. . .)  justify the ten-year revocation period.  The hearing officer
cited the PDPS Abstract, which was in the file provided to 
counsel,  as the source of the other two alcohol enforcement
contacts.  76 
 
  Wolcott’s counsel orally moved to strike the alleged 
prior alcohol enforcement contacts from Oregon because the 
abstract was not a sworn statement and there was no evidence as
to its source:  
I don’t know how it was generated.  I don’t know how it got
to this office.  It is an official government document, and
an official government document needs to be a sworn 
statement to be admissible in this proceeding.   
 
 
Counsel stated that he was only contesting the ten- year  
                                                 
6 On August 25, 2014, the ADLRO mailed Wolcott a copy of the PDPS 
Abstract, which was also in the discovery file provided to Wolcott’s counsel.
However, the PDPS Abstract was an “untitled”  document with “DRIVERS LICENSE 
STATUS INQUIRY” printed at the top of each page.  At the hearing, the hearing
officer did not state that the source of the document was the Problem Driver 
Pointer System; he merely called it “the abstract .”   
 
 
7 When Wolcott’s counsel asked the hearing officer to provide the dates 
of the out- of-state alcohol enforcement contacts , the hearing officer stated 
that Wolcott had one conviction for Driving Under the Influence (DUI ) in 
Oregon on May 22, 2007, and “one outside of Oregon. ”  However, it appears 
that the hearing officer misread the PDPS A bstract at that time.   In the 
hearing officer’s written decision, the ADLRO determined that Wolcott had two
prior DUI convictions in Oregon and two prior OVUII convictions in Hawaiʻi.  
The Oregon convictions are based on the following two entries in the ten- page

8 revocation and requested that the hearing officer amend the 
revocation period to reflect that Wolcott only had two prior
alcohol enforcement contacts.  
On June 10, 2015, the hearing officer filed his 
written decision affirming the administrative review decision to
revoke Wolcott’s driving privilege s for ten years.  Therein, the
hearing officer denied Wolcott’s oral motion to strike the PDPS 
Abstract reflecting any Oregon DUI convictions.  The hearing 
officer determined that HRS § 291E- 36(b)(4)  requires a listing 
of all alcohol enforcement contacts involving an OVUII arrestee 
who refuses to submit to a blood alcohol concentration test, but
there is no requirement that the listing be a sworn statement.  
The hearing officer noted that the PDPS Abstract “is merely a 8 
 
 
                                                 
8 HRS § 291E- 36(b) (Supp. 2012) provides:  
 
(b)   Whenever a respondent has been arrested for a 
violation of Section 291E -61 or 291E -61.5 and refuses to 
submit to a test to determine alcohol concentration or drug
content in the blood or urine, the following shall be 
forwarded immediately to the director:   
(1) A copy of the arrest report and the sworn 
statement of the arresting law enforcement officer, stating
facts that establish that [there was reasonable suspicion 
to stop the vehicle; probable cause to believe the 
respondent was operating a vehicle under the influence of 
an intoxicant; that respondent was informed of possible 
sanctions; and that respondent refused to be tested];   
 
. . . . 
 
(4) A listing of all alcohol and drug enforcement
contacts involving the respondent .  
 
(Emphasis added.)  
  
 
***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
9 (continued. . .)  compilation of a person’s traffic infractions which can be 
accessed to show a pers on’s out-of-state and in-state ‘DUI’
record.”  
The hearing officer made the following finding of 
fact: “Respondent has two (2) prior OVUII convictions in Hawaiʻi
(6/27/13 and 4/14/13 arrests resulting in convictions on 
3/20/14) 
and two (2) Oregon ‘DUI’ convictions (cited 2/27/05, 
convicted on 5/22/07; cited on 6/18/06, convicted on 9/11/06).”
Accordingly, the hearing officer concluded as a matter of law 
that Wolcott “has four (4) prior alcohol enforcement contacts 
within ten (10) years preceding the date the [notice of 
administrative revocation] was issued to [Wolcott.]”  Because 
Wolcott had four prior alcohol enforcement contacts within ten 
years preceding the date of the Notice of Administrative 
Revocation, the hearing officer affirmed the decision to revoke
Wolcott’s driving privileges for ten years.    9 
  
 
                                                 
9 HRS § 291E- 41 (Supp. 2012) provides the criteria for determining the
period of revocation.  It provides in relevant part:   
 
(b) . . . The periods of administrative revocation,
with respect to a license and privilege to operate a 
vehicle, that shall be imposed under this part are as 
follows:  
 
. . . . 
 
(3) A two-year revocation of license and privilege 
to operate a vehicle, if the respondent’s 
record shows two prior alcohol enforcement 
contacts or drug enforcement contacts during 
the five years preceding the date the notice of   
 
***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
10 (continued. . .)    Wolcott sought judicial review by the district court 
and argued that the hearing officer erred in finding that 
Wolcott had two prior alcohol enforcement contacts in Oregon 
because (1) there was no foundation to support that the PDPS 
Abstract was competent evidence; and (2) Wolcott was not 
provided with notice of the PDPS Abstract before the hearing
.  
The district court concluded that HRS § 291E-36(b)(4)  does not 
require the hearing officer to lay foundation for the listing of
prior alcohol enforcement contacts involving Wolcott and 
affirmed the ADLRO’s decision.   Accordingly, the district court 
affirmed the ten-year revocation of Wolcott’s license by 
Respondent/Respondent-Appellee Administrative Director of the 
Courts, State of 
Hawaiʻi (the Director) and entered a separate 10
 
                                                 
administrative revocation was issued;  
(4) A minimum of five years up to a maximum of ten
years revocation of license and privilege to 
operate a vehicle, if the respondent’ s record 
shows three or more prior alcohol enforcement 
contacts or drug enforcement contacts during 
the ten years preceding the date the notice of
administrative revocation was issued;   
 
 
. . . . 
 
(c)   If a respondent has refused to be tested after 
being informed: [of the sanctions in this part if he 
refuses to submit to testing], the revocation imposed under
subsection (b)(1), (2), (3), or (4) shall be for a period 
of two years, three years, four years, or ten years, 
respectively.   
 
(Emphases added.)

***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
11 judgment.  
In his appeal to the ICA, Wolcott again argued that he
was denied due process because (1) the hearing officer did not 
lay a foundation before admitting the PDPS Abstract; and 
(2) Wolcott did not have any notice as to what the PDPS Abstract
was or that the hearing officer would rely on it in making his 
decision until after the administrative hearing.  11 
 
The ICA affirmed the district court’s judgment , 
concluding that “[t]here is no requirement that evidence of 
prior alcohol enforcement contacts be in the form of a sworn 
statement.”  Additionally, the ICA noted that because “‘[ t]he 
respondent’s prior alcohol and drug enforcement contacts shall
be entered into evidence [,]’” the hearing officer “was 
statutorily required to enter the [PDPS Abstract] into 
evidence.”  (quoting HRS § 291E-38(f)) (emphasis added).    
III.  STANDARD OF REVIEW  
A. Secondary Appeal  
 
“Review of a decision made by a court upon its review
of an administrative decision is a secondary appeal.  The  
                                                 
11 At the hearing, the hearing officer told Wolcott’s counsel that he was
referring to the “abstract” as the source of the out -of-state alcohol 
enforcement contacts and counsel agreed that the abstr act was “an official 
government document,” but argued that the abstract  was not a sworn statement
and it was unclear how it was generated.  On appeal, Wolcott claimed that he
did not learn that the abstract originated from the Problem Driver Pointer 
System database until he received the hearing officer ’s written Decision.    
 
  
 
***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
12 standard of review is one in which this court must determine 
whether the court under review was right or wrong in its 
decision. ”  Freitas v. Admi n. Dir. of the Courts , 108 Hawaiʻi 31, 
43, 116 P.3d 673, 685 (2005) (quoting Soderlund v. Admin. Dir.

(internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets omitted).

court of an admini strative revocation of a driver ’s license by

review is one in which this court must determine whether the 
court [under review] was right or wrong in its decision[.]”

P.3d 1037, 1341 -42 (2006)  (internal quotation marks a nd citation 
omitted) . 
IV.  DISCUSSION  
 
Wolcott argues that (1) the ADLRO failed to provide 
him with adequate notice as to what the PDPS Abstract was or how  
                                                 
12 HRS § 291E- 40 (2007) provides in relevant part:  
 
 (c)   The sole issues before the court shall be
whether the director:   
(1) Exceeded constitutional or statutory authority;  
(2) Erroneously interpreted the law;  
(3) Acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner;  
(4) Committed an abuse of discretion; or  
(5) Made a determination that was unsupported by 
the evidence in the record.  
 (d)   The court shall not remand the matter back to 
the director  for further proceedings consistent with its 
order.  
 
***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
13 to decipher it prior to the hearing;  and (2) admitting the PDPS
Abstract without providing foundation violated Wolcott’s right 
to due process.  Wolcott notes that the PDPS Abstract is 
actually an untitled document and that the hearing officer 
failed to identify its source or explain how it was accessed 
when Wolcott’s counsel questioned it at the  hearing.  Wolcott 
concedes that strict foundation requirements applied by courts 
in judicial proceedings do not apply in administrative 
proceedings, but maintains that there must be “some foundation 
for a document to be received in evidence at [administrative] 
hearings.”    
As a threshold issue, we first note Wolcott is correct
that strict rules of evidence which apply to judicial 
proceedings do not apply to administrative proceedings
.  Honda 
v. Bd. of Trustees of the Employees ’ Ret. Sys. of the State, 108
Hawaiʻi 212, 218 
n.12, 118 P.3d 1155, 1161 n.12 (2005).  Thus, 
the ADLRO was not required to lay foundation for the PDPS 
Abstract within the meaning of  the Hawaiʻi Rules of Evidence.  
However, we next address Wolcott’s  argument  that in order to 
satisfy due process, the ADLRO must provide foundation for the 
PDPS Abstract prior to the hearing by identifying its source and
providing an explanation as to the 
codes used in the PDPS 
Abstract.  
 
  
 
***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
14  This court has consistently stated that “ [a] driver’s
license is a constitutionally protected interest and due process
must be provided before one can be deprived of his or her 
license.”  Slupecki v. Admin. Dir. of the Courts, 110 Hawai ʻi  
407, 413, 133 P.3d 1199, 1205 (2006) (citing Kernan v. Tanaka
, 
75 Haw. 1, 22-23, 856 P.2d 1207, 1218-19 (1993)).  “[P]rocedural
due process requires that a person have an ‘
opportunity to be 
heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner. ’”  
Freitas, 108 Hawai ʻi at 44, 116 P.3d at 686 (quoting Farmer v. 
Admin. Dir. of the Courts, 94 Hawaiʻ i 232, 238, 11 P.3d 457, 463 
(2000)).    
 
 
 “[D]ue process is flexible and calls for such 
procedural protections as the particular situation demands.” 
Kernan, 75 Haw. at 22, 856 P.2d at 1218 ( quoting Mathews v. 
Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334 (1976)).  The appropriate process 
  
requires consideration of three distinct factors: [1] the
private interest that will be affected by the official 
action; [2] the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such 
interest through the procedures used,  and the probable 
value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural 
safeguards; and [3] the government’s interest, including 
the function involved and the fiscal or administrative 
burdens that the additional procedures would entail.   
 
Id. at 22-23, 856 P.2d at 1218-19 (quoting Mathews, 424 U.S. 
319, 334-35).  Providing a presuspension revocation hearing 
is
presumed to “sufficiently assure reliable results and provide 
adequate due process. ”  Farmer, 94 Hawai ʻi at 239, 
11 P.3d at   
 
***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
15 464.  However, as the United States Supreme Court has observed,
“manifestly there is no hearing when the party does not know 
what evidence is offered or considered, and is not given an 
opportunity to test, explain, or refute. ”  Interstate Commerce 
Comm’n v. Louisville & N.R. Co., 227 U.S. 88, 93 (1913).  
Applying the Mathews  factors above, first, it is clear
that revocation of a driver’s license raises significant due 
process property interests.  See  Slupecki, 110 Hawai ʻi at 413, 
133 P.3d at 1205.  
Second, the procedures used to revoke Wolcott’s 
driver’s license, namely, sending him the  PDPS Abstract with no 
explanation of its source or how to read it, are insufficient in
light of the risk of an erroneous deprivation of his driver’s 
license for a ten-year period of time.  The PDPS Abstract is 
difficult to comprehend.   The information listing Wolcott’s  
Oregon DUI convictions are contained in two brief entries in the
ten-page PDPS.  That information reads, in its entirety: 13 
 
                                                 
13 It is unclear how a layperson or pro se respondent would be able to 
understand the PDPS Abstract considering that neither the hearing officer nor
Wolcott’s counsel could accurately read it.  At the hear ing, Wolcott’s 
counsel asked the hearing officer to provide the dates of the two out -of-
state alcohol enforcement contacts, but the hearing officer was only able to 
provide the date of one of the Oregon DUIs and wrongly stated that the other 
was in another unnamed state.  Thus, while we do not specify how the ADLRO 
should provide notice to respondents in driver’s license revocation 
proceedings, we suggest that the ADLRO provide a listing that offers 
sufficient explanation of prior alcohol and drug enforcement contacts  so that
a respondent can understand and meaningfully respond  — whether or not 
represented by counsel .

This information is surrounded by other charges, convictions, 
and dates that appear to be irrelevant to the DUI convictions. 
Taking the ten-page PDPS Abstract as a whole, it is, as Wolcott
states, “confusing to say the least.”    
 
Additionally, the hearing officer only revealed in his
written decision —  after the administrative hearing — that the 
evidence of Wolcott’s  Oregon DUI convictions came from the 
national Problem Driver Pointer System database.  T here is no 
indication of the source of the information on the face of the 
PDPS Abstract itself.  At an ADLRO hearing, the respondent must 
have the “opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a 
meaningful manner.”  Kernan, 75 Haw. at 22, 856 P.2d at 1218.  
The use of confusing and coded information in the PDPS Abstract 
and the failure of the hearing officer to explain to Wolcott the
source of the information and how to decipher it
 denied Wolcott 
a meaningful opportunity
 to challenge the evidence of the Oregon
DUIs.  Accordingly, the procedures that the ADLRO  implemented 
here presented a high risk of an erroneous deprivation of

17 Wolcott’s constitutionally protected property interest.14   
Third, while the government has a substantial interest
in ensuring that drivers with multiple OVUII convictions are 
kept off of Hawaiʻ i’s roads, the administrative burden of 
providing a “listing of prior alcohol enforcement contacts,” HRS
§ 291E-36(b)(4), that a respondent can understand and verify is 
not so high as to outweigh a driver’s constitutionally protected
property rights.  
See Slupecki, 110 Hawaiʻi at 413, 133 P.3d at 
1205.  Moreover, providing this information might lead to 
greater efficiency for the ADLRO, because a driver who receives 
a PDPS Abstract and is able to read and understand the ADLRO’s 
evidence of prior alcohol enforcement contacts will be less 
likely to request a hearing unless it is actually warranted.  
 
 
Therefore, on the facts of this case, Wolcott was 
denied due process when the ADLRO concluded that he had four 
prior alcohol enforcement contacts, because the PDPS Abstract
failed to provide Wolcott with sufficient notice of the two 
Oregon alcohol enforcement contacts.    
Accordingly, we hold that th e district court’s 
decision affirming the revocation of Wolcott’s driver’s license  
                                                 
14 In future cases, the ADLRO could minimize the risk of an erroneous 
deprivation by providing additional information to respondents along with the
PDPS Abstract.  The ADLRO could simply provide an information sheet that 
explains the source of the information in the PDPS Abstract and includ e a 
legend or key to decipher the codes used.

18 for ten years was wrong because it relied on the ADLRO’s 
erroneous inclusion of two prior alcohol enforcement contacts
for which he did not receive adequate notice.   
  Having concluded that the ADLRO erroneously revoked
Wolcott’s driver’s license for a period of ten years, we next
consider the appropriate remedy on remand.  
 
  Wolcott ’s two prior OVUII convictions in Hawaiʻi are 
not in dispute.  Had the ADLRO based its revocation decision 
solely on his two prior alcohol enforcement contacts
 in Hawaiʻi,
HRS § 291E-41  mandates a revocation period of four years.   15 
  In the context of driver’s license revocations, this 
court has held that when a hearing officer improperly considers
an alcohol enforcement contact as the basis for extending the 
revocation period, the appropriate remedy is to reverse the 
additional revocation period.  Custer v. Admin. Dir. of the 
Courts, 108 Hawaiʻ i 350, 120 P.3d 249 (2005).    
Here, the ADLRO reached the correct conclusion – that
Wolcott’s license should be revoked –  but imposed the wrong 
penalty by revoking Wolcott’s driver’s license for ten years  
instead of four.  Accordingly, we remand to the ADLRO with 
instructions to modify the revocation period in accordance with

this opinion.  
V.  CONCLUSION  
We hold that the pro cess used by the ADLRO in this 
case to revoke Wolcott ’s driver’s license for a period of ten 
years denied Wolcott due process.   Because Wolcott did not have 
adequate notice of the Oregon DUI convictions, he was unable to 
meaningfully respond to them.  Based on Wolcott’s  two prior 
Hawaiʻi OVUII contacts, the statutory revocation period for the 
instant OVUII arrest is four years.  Accordingly, we affirm the 
ICA’s June 25, 2019 judgment on appeal  in part , except that part
of the judgment relating to the additional revocation period 
erroneously imposed for having three or more prior alcohol 
enforcement contacts.  We vacate  the ICA’s judgment  relating to 
the additional six year- revocation period and remand to the 
ADLRO in accordance with our decision herein.
