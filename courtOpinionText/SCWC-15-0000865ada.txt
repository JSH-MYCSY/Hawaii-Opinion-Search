 protection rights were violated when they were each charged with 
one count of Prostitution under Hawaii Revised Statutes (“HRS”) 
§ 712-1200(1)(b)  (2014).  When Petitioners were charged,  HRS § 
712-1200(1)(b) provided that “[a] person commits the offense of 
prostitution if the person  . . . [p] ays, agrees to pay, or 
offers to pay a fee to another to engage in sexual conduct, ” and 
HRS § 712-1200(1)(a) provided that “[a] person commits the 
offense of prostitution if the person . . . [e]ngages
 in, or 
agrees or offers to engage in, sexual conduct with another 
person for a fee[.]”   In their motions to dismiss, Petitioners 
argued that HRS §§ 712- 1200(1)(a) and (1)(b) prohibited the same 
conduct, but subsection (1)(b) carried a harsher penalty because 
it made them ineligible for a deferred acceptance of a guilty or 
no contest plea (“DAG/DANC plea”) under HRS § 853 -4(a)(13)(V) 
(2014).  They argued that pursuant to State v. Modica , 58 Haw. 
249, 567 P.2d 420 (1977), where two crimes prohibit the same 
conduct, it would vi olate their due process and equal protection 
rights to convict them of the crime carrying the harsher 
penalty.  The District Court of the First Circuit (“district 
court”)1 agreed and entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of 
Law, and Order (“FOF/COL and Order”)  on October 6, 2015,

 granting Petitioners’ motions to dismiss based on  Modica and 
dismissing the charges with prejudice.    
 
On appeal, a majority of the Intermediate Court of Appeals 
(“ICA”) vacated the district court’s  rulings in a Summary 
Disposition Order (“SDO”), determining that HRS § 712- 1200(1)(a) 
applied only to sellers of sexual conduct while subsection 
(1)(b) pertained only to purchasers .  The ICA majority concluded 
that subsections (1)(a) and (1)(b) therefore prohibited 
different conduct, and that 
the district court erred in finding 
a Modica violation.  Judge Ginoza2 dissented, agreeing with the 
district court that a person charged under HRS § 712- 1200(1)(b) 
could be charged under HRS § 712- 1200(1)(a), and that subsection 
(1)(b) carried a harsher penalty by virtue of ineligibility for 
a DAG/DANC plea.   
 On certiorari, Petitioners assert the ICA majority erred in 
vacating the district court’s order granting dismissal.  We 
agree, and we therefore vacate the ICA’s SDO and Judgment on 
Appeal.  Because the district court did not provide reasons for 
its dismissal with prejudice, however, we remand these cases to 
the district court for further proceedings consistent with this 
opinion.

 II.  Background 
A.  District Court Proceedings 
 On September 10, 2014, Sasai was charged with one count of 
3Prostitution, in violation of HRS § 712-1200(1)(b).   Tanaka was 
4charged with the same offense on December 18, 2014.    
1. Petitioners’ Motions to Dismiss  
 
On May 15, 2015, Tanaka filed his Motion to Dismiss for 
Violation of Defendant’s Right to Due Process and Equal 
Protection of the Laws (“Tanaka Combined Motion”).  On June 9, 
2015, Sasai filed his Motion to Dismiss for Violation of 
Defendant’s Right to Due  Process and Equal Protection of the 
5Laws (“Sasai Modica Motion”) .
   
 In their respective motions, Petitioners requested their 
charges be dismissed, arguing that being charged under HRS § 
712-1200(1)(b) violated their due process and equal protection 
rights under the United States and Hawai ʻi constitutions because 
HRS § 712- 1200(1)(b) carried a harsher punishment, but contained 
“the exact same elements” as HRS § 712 -1200(1)(a).  They noted  
that this court, in Modica, ruled that a felony conviction would 
                     
3 This case was 1DCW -14-4628, which became CAAP -15-865. 
 
4 This case was 1DCW -14-5843, which became CAAP -15-866. 
 
5 Sasai filed his Motion to Dismiss for Violation of Defendant’s Right to 
Equal Protection of the Laws (“Sasai Equal Protection Motion”).  That motion, 
as well as part of the Tanaka Combined Motion, made an equal protection 
argument based on alleged discriminatory enforcement of the prostitution 
statute.  Petitioners have not pursued that argument on certiorari.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 violate the defendant’s rights to due process and the equal 
protection of the laws “where the same act committed under the 
same circumstances is punishable either as a felony or as a 
misdemeanor, under either of two statutory provisions, and the 
elements of proof essential to either conviction are exactly the 
same[.]”  58 Haw. at 251, 567 P.2d at 422  (citations omitted).  
Petitioners argued “the Modica rule applies to any situation 
where the elements of two different crimes regardless of their 
classification are the same, but the statutory penalties are 
different.”   
 Petitioners urged the district court to analyze “the 
elements of the charges based on the particular facts of the 
case[,]” as this court had done in State v. Hoang , 86 Hawai ‘i 48, 
947 P.2d 360 (1997), and the ICA had done in State v. Hatori , 92 
Hawai‘i 217, 990 P.2d 115 (App. 1999).  They contended  that both 
HRS §§ 712-1200(1)(a) and (1)(b) required “the ‘same act’ of 
entering into an agreement for sexual conduct for a fee, which 
implicitly involves agreement for payment,” and therefore that 
act was punishable “under either HRS § 712 -1200(1)(a) and HRS § 
712-1200(1)(b) ‘precisely because the elements of proof 
essential to either conviction are exactly the same.’”  This 
conclusion was supported, Petitioners contended, by the 
legislative history of HRS § 712- 1200.   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
6 
  
At the time Petitioners were charged, both HRS § 712-
1200(1)(a) and (1)(b) were petty misdemeanors punishable by a 
mandatory $500 fine and up to thirty days in jail, but 
convictions under subsection (1)(b) were not eligible for 
deferred acceptance of guilty or no contest plea under HRS § 
853-4(13)(V) (2014).  Because the punishment for subsection 
(1)(b) was more severe, that is, violators of subsection (1)(a) 
could seek a deferred plea but violators of (1)(b) could not, 
Petitioners asserted that their respective charges should be 
dismissed as a violation of their due process and equal 
protection rights under Modica.   
 In its memoranda in opposition to Petitioners’ respective 
motions, the State submitted, based on its interpretation of HRS 
§ 712-1200, that subsection (1)(a) should be read to apply only 
to “those persons offering sex for a fee,” whereas subsection 
(1)(b) should be read to apply to “those persons who offer a fee 
for sex. . . .”  The State urged the district court to read the 
statute this way “to give proper meaning to all portions of § 
712-1200,” and avoid rendering subsection (1)(b) a “nullity.”  
Further, the State argued the legislative history of the statute 
made clear that subsection (1)(b) was intended to apply to the 
patrons of prostitutes.   
 The State contended that HRS §§ 712- 1200(1)(a) and (1)(b) 
did not have the same elements and did not prohibit the same act ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
7 
 because “subsection (1)(a) applies to those who offer sex for 
money, whereas subsection (1)(b) applies to those [who] offer 
money for sex.”  The State asserted “[t]he acts . . . reside on 
opposite sides of the transaction or agreement and cannot, 
therefore, be the same act. ”  Additionally, the State argued the 
statutory penalties for violating subsections (1)(a) and (1)(b) 
were the same, and asserted that a deferral is a “non -penalty” 
because “[w]hether or not a deferral is an option is not the  
punishment itself but is a delayed dismissal given certain 
conditions.”   
2. District Court’s FOF/COL and Order  
 The district court held a two- day consolidated hearing on 
the motions to dismiss.  Petitioners called three witnesses and 
the district court acce pted several stipulations .6  On July 21, 
2015, the district court granted the Petitioners’ motions , based 
on Modica, and dismissed their respective charges  with 
prejudice.7   
 On October 6, 2015, the district court filed its written 
                     
6 Petitioners called two Honolulu Police Department (“ HPD”) officers and 
one former prosecutor to testify to the State and HPD’s enforcement practices 
with respect to HRS §§ 712-1200(1)(a) and (1)(b).  The majority of that 
testimony relates to the  equal protection argument not before this court.   
 
7 The district court took Petitioners’ discriminatory enforcement 
argument under advisement, and later denied their motions with respect to 
that argument.   
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
8 
 FOF/COL and Order.8  Based on the testimony of former Deputy 
Prosecuting Attorney Klemen Urbanc (“Urbanc”), the district 
court found that before the 2011 amendment to HRS § 712-1200(1), 
“both 
[purchasers and sellers of sexual conduct] were prosecuted 
under the same provision - HRS § 712 -1200(1); the subdivisions 
in what would later become HRS §§ 712- 1200(1)(a) and (1)(b) did 
not exist yet.  The language in HRS § 712- 1200 did not prohibit 
Urbanc from prosecuting any [purchasers of sexual conduct] 
charged with prostitution.”  Factual stipulations , entered into 
by the parties and the district court on June 26, 2015, further 
explained how HRS § 712-1200 changed over time: 
1.  Prior to 1990, HRS § 712 -1200(1) provided: “A person 
commits the offense of prostitution if the person engages 
in, or agrees or offers to engage in, sexual conduct with 
another person in return for a fee.”  
 
2.  In
 1990, HRS § 712 -1200(1) was amended to delete the 
phrase “in return” such that HRS § 712 -1200(1) then read:  
“A person commits the offense of prostitution if the person 
engages in, or agrees or offers to engage in, sexual 
conduct with another person for a  fee.” 
 
3.  The language of HRS § 712 -1200 remained the same from 
1990 until July 1, 2012.[9] 
 
4.  Effective April 25, 2013, HRS [§] 853 -4 excludes 
persons charged under HRS § 712 -1200(1)(b) from being able 
to move for a deferred acceptance of a no contest  or guilty 
plea.   
 
5.  Conference Committee Report No. 76 provides that one of 
the purposes of House Bill No. 240 [(the 2011 amendment to 
                     
8 Specifically, the  district court’s Order (1) granted Sasai’s Modica 
Motion; (2) denied Sasai’s Equal Protection  Motion; and (3) granted in part 
and denied in part Tanaka’s Combined Motion .   
 
9 House Bill No. 240, which amended HRS § 712- 1200 to include the 
language at issue in this case, actually became effective July 1, 2011.  H.B. 
240, S.D. 1, C.D. 1, 26th Leg.,  Reg. Sess. (2011).  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
9 
 HRS § 712- 1200)] was to “[e]xtend the offenses of 
prostitution and solicitation of prostitution to reach 
those who pay, agree to pay, or offer to pay a fee to 
another person to engage in sexual conduct.”  
 
. . . . 
 
 The district court concluded that only a purchaser of 
sexual conduct “can properly be charged under HRS § 712—
1200(1)(b)” but that “ all persons charged with prostitution —
whether [purchasers of sexual conduct] or [sellers of sexual 
conduct]—can properly be charged under HRS § 712- 1200(1)(a). ”  
This conclusion was “evident from the plain language of HRS § 
712-1200(1)(a),” the district court held, “ as both (i) a 
prospective or actual buyer of sex, and (ii) a prospective or 
actual seller of sex, can be said to engage in, agree to engage 
in, or offer to engage in sexual conduct with another person for 
a fee (as required by HRS § 712
-1200(1)(a)). ”  The enforcement 
history of the statute also supported this conclusion, because 
“[f]or many years, the State prosecuted both [purchasers and 
sellers of sexual conduct] under an identical statute (HRS § 
712-1200(1)),” and the fact that “the State pros ecuted [sellers 
and purchasers of sexual conduct] alike under a statute 
substantively identical to the current HRS § 712- 1200(1)(a) is 
further evidence to support the conclusion that all persons now 
charged with prostitution . . . can properly be charged under 
HRS § 712-1200(1)(a).”   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
10 
  The district court rejected  the State’s argument “that the 
Court’s interpretation of HRS § 712 -1200(1)(a) would render HRS 
§ 712-1200(1)(b) a nullity,” relying on its plain language 
interpretation of the statute: 
10. . . . HRS § 712 -1200(1)(b) properly can be used to 
charge [purchasers of sexual conduct], at least insofar as 
charging a [purchaser of sexual conduct]  with prostitution 
would comport with the plain language of the statute. 
Therefore, the Court’ s interpretation of HRS § 712-
1200(1)(a) does not render HRS § 712 -1200(1)(b) a nullity.  
The Court does, however, find that HRS § 712 -1200 (1)(b) is 
superfluous. However, neither HRS § 712 -1200(1)(a) nor HRS 
§ 712-1200(1)(b) are ambiguous. Although the Hawai[ ʻ]i 
Legislature may have adopted a superfluous statute, the 
Court cannot ignore the plain language of HRS § 712 -
1200(1)(a); and it cannot ignore the legislative history of 
HRS § 712 -1200, or the history of enforcement of the 
prostitution statute. Therefore, the Court cannot accept 
the State's argument on this point.  
 
11.  In all cases that were brought under HRS § 712 -
1200(1), and are or can be brought under HRS § 712 -
1200(1)(a), the fundamental bargain is identical: the 
accused offers to engage in sex (or agrees to engage in sex 
or does, in fact, engage in sex) with another person in 
exchange for a fee. This bargain is the same for both 
parties involved, as they both agree to engage in sex for a 
fee. Thus, the conduct is the same —engaging in sex for a 
fee—regardle ss of whether the involved party is a [seller 
of sexual conduct]  or a [purchaser of sexual conduct] . 
 
 Because a person charged under HRS § 712- 1200(1)(b) is 
prohibited from seeking a deferral of a guilty or no contest 
plea under HRS § 853- 4(a)(13)(V), the district court concluded 
that “in practical effect, a person charged under HRS § 712 -
1200(1)(b) is exposed to the possibility of a far harsher result 
than a person charged under HRS § 712- 1200(1)(a).”  That 
“harsher result” included a guaranteed fine, a  potential jail ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
11 
 sentence, and the inability to seek “deferral, dismissal and 
expungement[.]”   
 The district court recognized  that under Modica, “if a 
violation of a misdemeanor statute would invariably and 
necessarily also constitute a violation of a felony statute, 
then it is a violation of equal protection and due process to 
proceed against a defendant under the felony statute. ”  
Additionally, it noted a felony conviction is a due process and 
equal protection violation “when the same act committed under 
the same circumstances is punishable either as a felony or as a 
misdemeanor[.]”  Because Modica applied to differently classed 
felonies in State v. Arceo , 84 Hawai ‘i 1, 928 P.2d 843 (1996),  
the district court concluded it should logically apply “to 
differentially classed petty misdemeanors, such as charges under 
HRS §[§] 712 -1200(1)(a) and (1)(b).”  
 Finally, the district court concluded that the conduct 
prohibited by HRS §§ 712- 1200(1)(a) and (1)(b) was the same, and 
“[t]herefore, the result shoul d be the same, but it is not —due 
to HRS § 853-4(a)(13)(V), which essentially discriminates 
against defendants charged under HRS § 712
-1200(1)(b).”  The 
district court further concluded that b ecause “[t]he guiding 
principle of Modica  is that if the same conduct can be charged  
more harshly under one statute than an other,” it would be a 
violation of the due process and equal protection clauses for ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
12 
 the State to prosecute Petitioners under the “statute which 
yields a harsher penalty.”  The district court summarily 
dismissed the charges against Sasai and Tanaka with prejudice.  
 The district court’s Judgment and Notice was entered on 
October 10, 2015.  The State appealed and Tanaka cross-
appealed.10 
B. ICA Proceedings 
 On the State’s motion, Petitioners’ cases were consolidated 
under CAAP-15-865.   
 In its opening brief, the State raised three points of 
error related to the Petitioners’ Modica motions.  First, the 
State challenged COLs 5 through 12, in which the district court 
interpreted the language of HRS §§ 712
-1200(1)(a) and (1)(b) as 
prohibiting the same conduct.  The State reasserted its argument 
that subsection (1)(a) applies solely to sellers of sexual 
conduct because subsection (1)(b) applies 
solely to purchasers.  
Second, the State disputed COLs 17 through 19, which analyzed 
HRS §§ 712-1200(1)(b) and 853
-4, asserting that even if HRS § 
712-1200(1)(b) was subject to a harsher penalty, Modica  did not 
apply to the Petitioners’ cases because “the elements o f the two 
subsections are not the same.”  Third, the State  noted that 
                     
10 Tanaka’s cross appeal argued the Petitioners’ discriminatory 
enforcement argument, and challenged errors in the FOF that Tanaka  ultimately 
conceded did not “significantly affect the district court’s ruling denying 
Tanaka’s motion in part (or granting Tanaka’s motion in part).”   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
13 
 Petitioners conceded the State could refile the charges under 
HRS § 712-1200(1)(a) if the charges under subsection (1)(b) were 
dismissed without prejudice. 
 The State asserted the distri ct court’s interpretation of 
HRS §§ 712-1200(1)(a) and (1)(b), in addition to rendering 
subsection (1)(b) “superfluous,” also rendered HRS § 853 -
4(a)(13)(V) void.  The State opined that if the legislature 
thought HRS § 712-1200(1)(a) applied to 
purchasers of sexual 
conduct as well as sellers, “it could and it would have amended 
the language . . . so that it would have been even clearer that 
HRS § 712-1200(1)(a) is not a proper 
charge for those who buy 
sex.” 
 
Petitioners  argued their alleged conduct would be a 
violation of HRS § 712- 1200(1)(a) that necessarily constituted a 
violation of HRS § 712- 1200(1)(b).  They explained that in 
Hoang, this court looked to the elements of the statutes, 
language of the charging document, and the specific facts of the 
case to determine whether a Modica violation had occurred.  86 
Hawai‘i at 58, 947 P.2d at 370.  Petitioners noted that in 
Hatori, the ICA performed a similar analysis to conclude that, 
as applied to the facts of that case, charging under a higher-
grade felony statute was a Modica violation.  92 Hawai ‘i at 227, 
990 P.2d at 125.   Based on these cases, Petitioners asserted the ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
14 
 State was required to prove the same facts under HRS §§ 712-
1200(1)(a) and (1)(b):  
Under either of the two statutory provisions, the State 
essentially must establish the following: a defendant 
intentionally or knowingly entered into agreement with 
another person; the first term of the agreement is to 
engage in sexual conduct; and the second term of the 
agreement is payment of a fee. Thus, the act of “agreeing 
to engage in sexual conduct with another person for a fee,” 
which is required for a conviction for HRS § 712 -1200(1)(a) 
is identical to the act of “agreeing  to pay a fee to 
another to engage in sexual condu ct”, which is required for 
the [sic] a conviction under HRS § 712 -1200(1)(b). Clearly, 
the harm, which the Modica rule seeks to prevent, is 
perpetuated when the State is allowed to exercise unguided 
discretion in choosing to charge a person under subsection 
(1)(b) instead of (1)(a) when the elements of proof under 
[sic] offense are identical.  
 
 Petitioners asserted 
subsection s (1)(a) and (1)(b) provided  
no limitations or guidance for their application, leaving the 
State with unbridled discretion in choosing which defendants to 
charge under which subsection.  Although Petitioners conceded 
that the legislature intended to render persons charged under 
HRS § 712- 1200(1)(b) ineligible for deferral, they contended the 
legislature’s intent with respect to either HRS § 712 -1200(1)(b) 
or HRS § 853-4 was irrelevant to application of the Modica  rule. 
 In reply, the State argued that a subsequent amendment to 
HRS § 712-1200(1)(a) in 2016  “confirmed” the legislature’s 
original intent was that HRS § 712- 1200(1)(a) should apply to 
sellers of sexual conduct and HRS § 712- 1200(1)(b) should apply 
to purchasers of sexual conduct.   Specifically, the legislature 
distinguished subsection (1)(a) from subsection (1)(b) by adding ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
15 
 the phrase “in return,” so that subsection (1)(a) was violated 
when a person engaged in 
sexual conduct “in return for a fee.”11 
 In its SDO, the ICA vacated the district co urt’s order 
insofar as it granted the Petitioners’ motions based on Modica.  
State v. Sasai, No. CAAP-15- 865, State v. Tanaka , No. CAAP-15 -
866 (App. Jun. 30, 2017) (SDO) at 2.  While it concluded that 
the district court’s reading of HRS § 712 -1200(1)(b) was 
correct, and that subsection applied only to purchasers of 
sexual conduct, the ICA held that the district court erred in 
determining that subsection (1)(b) was superfluous.  Sasai, SDO 
at 4.  In order to “harmonize” subsections (1)(a) and (1)(b), 
and give effect to them both, the ICA concluded that if 
subsection (1)(b) applied to the purchasers 
of sexual conduct, 
then subsection (1)(a) was meant to apply to the sellers of 
sexual conduct.  Sasai , SDO at 4 -5.  The ICA looked to the 
legislative history of HRS § 712 -1200(1)(b ), as well as the 
subsequent amendment to HRS § 712- 1200(1)(a),  to confirm its 
interpretation of the statute.  Sasai, SDO at 5.    
 Having determined that subsections (1)(a) and (1)(b) 
prohibited different conduct, the ICA reasoned that the 
subsections therefore contained different “essential elements 
                     
11  When the State filed its Reply Brief on June 2, 2016, it noted that the 
amendment “was awaiting the Governor’s signature to go into effect.”  The 
amendment became effective on  July 1, 2016.  HRS § 712 -1200 (2016).  
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 for each offense and can be punished differently.”   Sasai, SDO 
at 6.  The ICA held that the Modica rule did not apply to 
Petitioners’ cases and the district court erred in granting 
their motions to dismiss.   Id.     
 Judge Ginoza dissented.   Sasai, SDO at 12 (Ginoza, J., 
dissenting).  In her view, the history and plain language of HRS 
§§ 712-1200(1)(a) and (1)(b) made clear that a person “who 
pays/agrees to pay/offers to pay a fee to another to engage in 
sexual conduct” could be charged under either subsection, and 
that “the prohibited conduct was the same under both 
subsections.”  Sasai , SDO at 13 (Ginoza, J., dissenting).   “In 
short,” she explained,  “for such person, the elements of proof 
for conviction under either subsection (1)(a) or (1)(b) were the 
same, and a violation of subsection (1)(a) would invariably and 
necessarily constitute a violation of subsection (1)(b).”  
Sasai, SDO at 13-14 (Ginoza, J., dissenting).   
 Judge Ginoza noted  that although Modica addressed a felony 
and a misdemeanor offense, this court has applied the Modica 
rule to different grades of felonies in Arceo, and the ICA did 
so in Hatori.  Sasai , SDO at 14 (Ginoza, J., dissenting).  She 
opined that Modica  applied to Petitioners’ cases, where both 
subsection (1)(a) and subsection (1)(b) were petty misdemeanors 
but “the penalty under subsection (1)(b) is more severe in that 
a DAG is precluded under HRS § 853-4(a )(13)(V).”  Id.  In sum, ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
17 
 Judge Ginoza would have affirmed the district court ’s dismissal 
of Petitioners’ charges .  Id.   
C. Application for Writ of Certiorari 
 
Petitioners raise a single question in their Application:  
“Whether the ICA majority gravely erred in holding that the 
trial court erred in dismissing the charges due to violations of 
Petitioners’ Due Process and Equal Protection rights pursuant to 
State v. Modica, 58 Haw. 249, 567 P.2d 4
[2]0 (1977).”  They make 
three arguments:  first, the ICA majority incorrectly 
interpreted HRS § 712-1200(1)(a) by  relying on dictionary 
definitions; second, the subsequent legislative history of HRS § 
712-1200(1)(a) did not support the majority’s position; and 
third, the majority judicially revised the statute, which was 
improper.   
 
Petitioners assert that,  based on the ICA’s definition of 
“engage” as “to do or take part in something,” a person can be 
either the fee payer or fee recipient and commit prostitution 
under HRS § 712-1200(1)(a).  They contend that t he “essence” of 
the offense of prostitution “is that the parties enter into an 
agreement or contract for sexual conduct for a fee.”  Because 
the statute contained no limitation to reduce the scope of 
subsection (1)(a) to the 
sellers of sexual conduct, Petitioners 
argue the plain language of HRS § 712-1200(1)(a) prohibited both 
the buying and selling of sexual conduct.  
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
18 
  As to the ICA majority’s use of subsequent legislative 
history, Petitioners assert that subsequent legislative history 
“should be viewed with extreme caution,” citing precedent by 
this court and persuasive authority from the United States 
Supreme Court.  Petitioners contend  that, instead,  the actual 
legislative history of HRS § 712- 1200(1)(a) is  relevant, and its 
1990 amendment made clear that the language of HRS § 712- 1200(1) 
was meant to apply to both sellers of sexual conduct and 
purchasers.  They assert the 2011 amendment splitting  HRS § 712-
1200(1) into subsections (1)(a) and (1)(b) was  intended to 
prohibit the purchasing of sexual conduct.   Based on committee 
reports, Petitioners maintain, however, that the legislature 
enacted the 2011 amendment because it was mistaken about the 
effect of its  1990 amendment, which already prohibited that 
behavior.   
 Petitioners argue that the 2016 amendment to HRS § 712-
1200(1)(a) was a substantive change to the law, not a 
“clarification” of its language , because the statute was already 
clear and unambiguous.  Ultimately, they argue, the 
legislature’s 2016 “clarification” o f HRS § 712 -1200(1)(a) to 
“distinguish” it from subsection (1)(b) was indicative of the 
fact that,  previously,  there was no distinction between the 
sections, and purchasers of sexual conduct could have been 
charged under either subsection (1)(a) or (1)(b) .  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
19 
  Finally, Petitioners assert the ICA majority’s 
interpretation of HRS § 712- 1200(1)(a) was an improper judicial 
revision of the statute.  They argue t he ICA majority’s 
interpretation of the word “engage” improperly limited the 
application of subsection (1)(a) to the sellers of sexual 
conduct, which did not comport with the plain and unambiguous 
language of the statute.  Furthermore, Petitioners opine that 
the district court’s interpretation of subsection (1)(a) does 
not render subsection (1)(b) superfluous.  Rather,  in their 
view, it would mean that defendants charged under subsection 
(1)(b) between April 25, 2013 and July 1, 2016, would have a 
Modica challenge, as long as they were otherwise eligible for a 
deferral.   
II. Standards of Review 
A. Questions of Law 
Questions  of law are reviewable de novo under the 
right/wrong standard  of review.  State v. Jess , 117 Hawai ʻi 381, 
391, 184 P.3d 133, 143 (2008).  
B. Statutory Construction 
This court’s  construction of statutes is guided by the 
following rules:  
First, the fundamental starting point for statutory 
interpretation is the language of the statute itself.  
Second, where the statutory language is plain and 
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain 
and obvious meaning.  Third, implicit in 
the task of 
statutory construction is our foremost obligation to ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
20 
 ascertain and give effect to the intention of the 
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the 
language contained in the statute itself.  Fourth, when 
there is doubt, doubleness of  meaning, or indistinctiveness 
or uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, an 
ambiguity exists.   
 
State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai ʻi 383, 390, 219 P.3d 1170, 1177  
(2009) (quoting Citizens Against Reckless Dev. v. Zoning Bd. of 
Appeals of the City & Cty. of Honolulu , 114 Hawai ʻi 184, 193, 159  
P.3d 143, 152 (2007)). 
III.  Discussion      
A. Evolution of HRS § 712 -1200 
 Before  its amendment in 1990, HRS § 712 -1200 provided :  “A 
person commits the offense of prostitution if the person engages 
in, or agrees or offers to engage in, sexual conduct with 
another person in return for a fee .”  HRS § 712-1200(1) (1986) 
(emphasis added).  In 1990, the phrase “in return” was removed , 
so that HRS § 712-1200(1) provided:  “A person commits the 
offense of prostitution if the person engages in, or agrees or 
offers to engage in, sexual conduct with another person for a 
fee.”  1990 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 204, § 1 at 442.   As recounted 
by the IC A in 
State v. Espinosa , 120 Hawai ‘i 478, 210 P.3d 1  
(App. 2009) , “both the Senate and House Judiciary committees 
noted . . . that the purpose of . . . amend[ing] HRS § 712 –1200 
[was] ‘to make it clear that the customer of a prostitute is 
also guilty of the offense of prostitution[.]’”  120 Hawai ‘i at 
480, 201 P.3d at 3 (citing S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 325, in 1989 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
21 
 Senate Journal, at 946; H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1205 –90, in 
1990 House Journal, at 1316).   
 
In 2011, the legislature further amended HRS §  712-1200(1), 
splitting it into the two subsections at issue in this case.  
H.B. 240, S.D. 1, C.D. 1, 26th Leg., Reg. Sess. (2011).  
Although the 1990 amendment already rendered HRS § 712 -1200(1) 
applicable to the purchasers of sexual conduct, Espinosa , 121 
Hawai‘i at 480, 210 P.3d at 3, the legislature ’s 2011 amendment 
intended to “[e]xtend the offense[] of prostitution . . . to 
reach those who pay, agree to pay, or offer to pay a fee to 
another person to engage in sexual conduct[.]”  Conf. Comm. Rep. 
No. 76 on H.B. No. 240 in 2011 House Journal, at 1630, 2011 
Senate Journal, at 732.  The Senate Standing Committee Report 
specifically states the amendment was intended “to address the 
concerns raised from the case State v. Espinoza [sic][.]”  S. 
Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1137, in 2011 Senate Journal, at 1285.   
 Whether or not the legislature was mistaken as to the 
effect of the 1990 amendment, the 2011 amendment retained the 
language of HRS § 712 -1200(1) (Supp. 1990) when it created HRS §  
712-1200(1)(a) (Supp. 2011), which provided:  “A person commits 
the offense of prostitution if the person . . . [e]ngages in, or 
agrees or offers to engage in, sexual conduct with another 
person for a fee[.] ”  HRS § 712-1200(1)(a) (Supp. 2011).  In 
contrast, the newly created subsection (1)(b) contained new ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
22 
 language:  “A person commits the offense of prostitution if the 
person . . . [p]ays, agrees to pay, or offers to pay a fee to 
another to engage in sexual conduct.”  HRS § 712-1200(1)(b) 
(Supp. 2011).   
 Effective July 1, 2016, HRS § 
712-1200(1)(a) now provides:  
“A person commits the offense of prostitution if the person . . 
. [e]ngages in, or agrees or offers to engage in, sexual conduct 
with another person in return for a fee[.]”  H.B. 2561, 28th 
Leg., Reg. Sess. (2016) (emphasis in original).  This amendment 
was intended to “clarify” HRS § 712 -1200(1)(a), “distinguishing 
the offense from the offense under section 712- 1200(1) . . . in 
which the other person pays the fee[.]”  Id.  This case, 
however, is governed by the previous version of the statute.  
B. The Modica Rule 
 In Modica, this court held that a defendant’s rights to due 
process of law and equal protection of the laws would be 
violated when “a violation of [a] misdemeanor statute . . . 
would invariably and necessarily constitute a violation of the 
felony provision.”  58 Haw. at 250, 567 P. 2d at 421 (citations 
omitted).  A defendant may not be convicted of an offense that 
carries a harsher penalty than another offense containing the 
same elements: 
[W]here the same act committed under the same circumstances 
is punishable either as a felony or  as a misdemeanor, under 
either of two statutory provisions, and the elements of 
proof essential to either conviction are exactly the same, ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
23 
 a conviction under the felony statute would constitute a 
violation of the defendant’s rights to due process and the 
equal protection of the laws.     
 
58 Haw. at 251, 567 P.2d at 422 (citations omitted).  However, 
where the defendant’s conduct violates either of two statutes, 
but the defendant is charged or convicted of the offense that 
carries the lesser punishment, there is no Modica violation.  
See Hoang, 86 Hawai ʻi at 59, 947 P.2d at 371 (holding that 
because the defendant was charged with the misdemeanor offense, 
he could not be convicted of the felony, and therefore “was not 
threatened with unbridled, capricious, and prejudicial 
prosecutorial discretion.”).  
 Although “[s]tatutes may on occasion overlap, depending on 
the facts of a particular case, . . . it is generally  no defense 
to an indictment” that the defendant could have been charged 
under another statute.  Modica, 58 Haw. at 251, 567 P.2d at 422.  
Rather, when statutes overlap, “the matter is necessarily and 
traditionally subject to the prosecuting attorney’s discretion.”  
58 Haw. at 251, 567 P.2d at 422.  Overlapping statutes raise 
constitutional concerns when, lacking legislative guidance, 
prosecutors are left with unbridled discretion to charge 
defendants with a more severe offense.  58 Haw. at 251, 567 P.2d 
at 422 (citing State v. Pirkey , 281 P.2d 698, 703 (Or. 
1955)(overruled on different grounds by City of Klamath Falls v. 
Winters, 619 P.2d 217 (Or. 1980)) (holding it was ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
24 
 unconstitutional “to vest in a grand jury or magistrate the 
unguided and untrammeled discretion to determine whether a 
defendant shall be charged with a felony or a misdemeanor [.]”); 
Olsen v. Delmore, 295 P.2d 324, 327 (Wash. 1956) (citing Pirkey 
for the proposition that the statute at issue “lodged . . .
discretion with prosecuting officials” and was therefore 
12unconstitutional)).     
 Unbridled prosecutorial discretion has remained a chief 
concern in this court’s application of the Modica rule.  
In 
Arceo, the defendant was charged with one count of sexual 
assault in the first degree, in violation of HRS § 707-
                     
12 In United States v. Batchelder , 442 U.S. 11 4 (1979), the United States 
Supreme Court held that it was not unconstitutional for two statutes with 
different penalties to prohibit identical conduct, as long as the government 
“does not discriminate against any class of defendants.”  442 U.S. at 124 -25.  
The Court held that a prosecutor’s decision to charge under one statute or 
the other is never “unfettered” because “[s]electivity in the enforcement of 
criminal laws is, of course, subject to constitu tional constraints.”  442 
U.S. at 125- 26.  In effect, Batchelder overruled Pirkey and Olsen insofar as 
they held that it was unconstitutional under the equal protection clauses of 
the federal constitution to grant such discretion to charging officials.   
 Some states have adopted the Batchelder  analysis. See City of Klamath 
Falls v. Winters, 619 P.2d 217 (Or. 1980) (recognizing that Batchelder  
overruled Pirkey); see  generally State v. Rooney , 19 A.3d 92 (Vt. 2011); 
State v. Williams, 175 P.3d 1029 (Utah 2007); Johnson v. State, 61 P.3d 1234 
(Wyo. 2003).   
 Some states have declined to follow Batchelder  on state law grounds.  
See generally State v. Thompson , 200 P.3d 22 (Kan. 2009); People v. Sharpe , 
839 N.E.2d 492 (Ill. 2005); People v. Estrada , 601 P.2d 619 (Colo. 1979).   
This court has continued to embrace the Modica rule.  See Arceo, 84 
Hawaiʻi 1, 928 P.2d 843 (applying the Modica rule in 1996, after Batchelder  
was announced).  We decline to adopt Batchelder .  Our state constitution may 
afford our citizens broader protections than the federal constitution.  
Arceo, 84 Hawai‘ i at 28, 928 P.2d at 870 (quoting State v. Wallace , 80 Hawai‘ i 
382, 397 n.14, 910 P.2d 695, 710 n.14 (1996)); State v. Hoey, 77 Hawai ‘i 17, 
36, 881 P.2d 504, 523 (1994)).  As our cases after Batchelder could not have 
been based on the federal constitution, they were based on the due process 
and equal protection clauses of Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution of 
the State of Hawaiʻ i.    ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
25 
 730(1)(b)(1993), and one count of sexual assault in the third 
degree, in violation of HRS § 707-732(1)(b)(1993).  84 Hawai ʻi at 
2-3, 928 P.2d at 844- 45.  The State argued those offenses could 
be charged as continuing offenses.  84 Hawai ʻi at 4 , 928 P.2d at 
846.  This court disagreed, holding instead that each act in 
violation of those statutes was a separate offense.  84 Hawai ʻi 
at 21, 928 P.2d at 863.  To hold otherwise, we concluded, would 
have meant that “the same acts committed under the same 
circumstances coul
d, by virtue of the prosecution’s charging 
option or whim, be punishable either as a single offense or as 
multiple offenses, even though the elements of proof essential 
to either result would be exactly the same.”  84 Hawai ʻi at 22, 
928 P.2d at 864.   
 
Although Modica  analyzed a misdemeanor and a felony 
statute, this court applied the Modica rule to two differently 
classed felonies in Arceo.  84 Hawai ʻi at 22, 928 P.2d at 864.  
As the focus of the Modica rule is curbing unbridled 
prosecutorial discretion when identical conduct could constitute 
crimes carrying punishments of differing severity, the Modica 
rule can apply to offenses with the same or different statutory 
classes.  Thus, as in the present case, the Modica rule can 
apply—if its requirements are otherwise met —to two petty
misdemeanors.   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
26 
  In sum, the 
Modica rule requires the court to answer three 
questions:  (1) wh ether defendant’s alleged conduct is 
punishable under either of two statutory provisions;  (2) whether 
the elements of proof essential to conviction under the statutes 
are exactly the same; and, (3) whether the punishment for the 
offense with which the defendant was charged or convicted is 
greater than the punishment for the alternative offense.  58 
Haw. at 250-51, 567 P.2d at 421-22.      
C. Petitioners’ Charges Violated the Modica Rule  
1. Petitioners’ conduct was punishable under either HRS
§§ 712-1200(1)(a) or (1)(b)  
 
The threshold question of the Modica inquiry is whether the 
defendant’s alleged conduct  is punishable under either of two 
statutory provisions.   58 Haw. at 251, 567 P.2d at 422.  This 
court’s analysis must begin with the plain language of the 
statute.  Wheeler, 121 Hawai ‘i at 390, 219 P.3d at 1177.   
 When Petitioners were charged, HRS § 712- 1200(1)(a) 
provided that a person who “[e] ngages in, or agrees or offers to 
engage in, sexual conduct with another person for a fee ” 
committed the offense of prostitution.  HRS § 712 -1200(1)(a) 
(2014).  Subsection (1)(b) provided that one who “[p] ays, agrees 
to pay, or offers to pay a fee to another to engage in sexual 
conduct” also commits the offense of prostitution.  HRS § 712
-
1200(1)(b) (2014).  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
27 
  The ICA reasoned that because subsection (1)(b) was limited 
to purchaser s, subsection (1)(a) must therefore be limited to 
sellers.  Sasai, SDO at 4- 5.  The ICA looked to a 2016 amendment 
of HRS § 712-1200(1)( a) to “confirm” its interpretation of the 
pre-2016 text, and sought to “harmonize” subsections (1)(a) and 
(1)(b) under the guidance of State v. Davis , 63 Haw. 191, 624 
P.2d 376 (1981) .13  Sasai, SDO at 4.   The ICA erred in attempting 
to “harmonize” the subs ections of HRS § 712-1200 “to give effect 
to them both” because the plain text of each subsection was 
unambiguous . 
 Although HRS § 712- 1200(2) (2014) defined “sexual conduct” 
by reference to HRS § 707- 700 (2014), neither  of those  section s 
defined the terms “engages in” or “pays.”  As the ICA noted, 
courts may look to “legal or other well accepted dictionaries” 
to ascertain the “ordinary meaning” of words in a statute.  
State v. Jing Hua Xiao , 123 Hawai
‘i 251, 259, 231 P.3d 968, 976 
(2010).  To “engage” is “[t]o employ or involve oneself; to take 
                     
13 Davis stated:   
 
Statutes should be interpreted according to the intent and 
meaning, and not always according to the letter, and every 
part thereof must be viewed in connection with the whole so 
as to make all parts harmonize, if practicable, and give a 
sensible and intelligent  effect to each.  
 
Davis, 63 Haw. at 193, 624 P.2d at 380.  Davis stands for the proposition  
that statutes should be read in pari materia  to discern their meaning.  Davis 
is not relevant to determining whether a defendant’s constitutional rights 
under the Modica rule are implicated by different statutes or different 
subsections of a statute.   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
28 
 part in[.]”14  Black’s Law Dictionary  (10th ed. 2014).  The word 
“pay” has multiple definitions, but HRS § 712 -1200(1)(b) employs 
it as a verb, and as such “pay”  generally connotes a monetary 
transaction between two or more parties.  See Black’s Law  
Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (defining “pay” as “1. To give money 
for a good or service that one buys; to make satisfaction . . . 
3. To give (someone) money for the job that he or she does; to 
compensate a person for his or her occupation[.]”)  
 By use of the phrase “[e]ngages in,” subsection (1)(a) made 
it illegal to “involve oneself” or “to take part in” any “sexual 
conduct with another person for a fee.”  As the district court 
correctly concluded, this language prohibits conduct on both 
sides of the prostitution transaction.  The purchasers  and 
sellers of sexual conduct both “take part in” and “involve 
themselves” with prostitution.  A person who offers sexual 
conduct for a fee literally “employs” themselves in 
prostitution, but the purchaser  of sexual conduct is no less 
“engaged” in the transaction.  
 Thus, b ecause Petitioners’ alleged conduct was punishable 
under either HRS § 712- 1200(1)(a) or HRS § 712- 1200(1)(b), the 
first part of the Modica  test is satisfied. 
                     
14 The ICA defined “engage” as “to do or take part in something.”  Sasai, 
SDO at 3 (quoting Merriam -Webster, https://www.merriam -
webster.com/dictionary/engage  (last visited May 1, 2018)) .   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
29 
 2. The elements of proof essential to conviction under 
HRS §§ 712- 1200(1)(a) and (1)(b) are identical, as 
applied to purchasers  of sexual conduct 
Turning to the second part of the Modica inquiry, a denial 
of the defendant’s constitutional rights occurs “only if a 
violation of the misdemeanor statute . . . would invariably and 
necessarily constitute a violation of the felony provision.”  58 
Haw. at 250, 567 P.2d at 421.  Further, “the eleme nts of proof 
essential to either conviction” must be “exactly the same.”  58 
Haw. at 251, 567 P.2d at 422.   
 As discussed above, all violations of HRS § 712- 1200(1)(b) 
would also be violations of subsection (1)(a),  as it existed 
before July 1, 2016.  Subsection (1)(a), however, contains 
broader language than subsection (1)(b), such that there are at 
least two ways to “engage” in prostitution under that 
subsection:  one may pay, or one may otherwise “engage” by 
selling sexual conduct.  As a result, violatio n of subsection 
(1)(a), the offense with the lesser punishment, is not 
invariably and necessarily a violation of subsection (1)(b), the 
offense with the greater punishment, and ordinarily the Modica 
rule would not be violated.   See State v. Kuuku , 61 Haw. 79,  82, 
595 P.2d 291, 294 (1979) (finding no Modica rule violation where 
there were “any number of ways by which the [misdemeanor] 
statute may be violated without also violating the [felony] 
statute.”); but see Hatori , 92 Hawai ‘i at 227, 990 P.2d at 125 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
30 
 (finding a Modica violation where the lesser offense prohibited 
a broader range of conduct, but the conduct at issue would 
always constitute a violation of both the lesser and greater 
offenses). 
 Nonetheless, the 2011 amendment to HRS § 712- 1200(1) made 
possible the existence of “ the very evils rendered unlawful by 
the Modica rule.”  See Arceo, 84 Hawai ʻi at 22, 928 P.2d at 864 
(identifying due process and equal protection violations in a 
charging practice subject to “the prosecution’s charging option 
or whim”).  The language of HRS § 712-1200(1) (Supp. 1990) 
applied to both purchasers
 and sellers of sexual conduct, and 
that language was used verbatim in HRS § 712-1200(1)(a) (2011 ).  
Given that they have identical language, subsection (1)(a) 
(Supp. 2011) should logically be interpreted the same way that 
section (1) (Supp. 1990) once was — to apply to both purchasers 
and sellers of sexual conduct.   
 As explained in Part I
II, Section C(1), the plain language 
of HRS §§ 712-1200(1)(a) and (1)(b) (Supp. 2011) gave 
prosecutors the ability to charge purchasers
 under either 
subsection, at their discretion.15  The amendment of HRS § 712-
                     
15 At the hearing on the motions to dismiss, a list of defendants charged 
under HRS § 712- 1200(1)(b) and the known dispositions of their cases was 
admitted into evidence.  That list of dispositions indicated that at least 
four defendants charged under HRS § 712 -1200(1)(b) after April 25, 2013, were 
ultimately granted deferred pleas  after the State amended their charges to 
HRS § 712- 1200(1)(a).

 1200(1) in 2011 created a Modica problem, because it leaves the 
determination of the defendant’s charges and ultimate punishment 
to be governed by the prosecutor’s discretion.   See State v. 
Lee, 75 Haw. 80, 93, 856 P.2d 1246, 1254 (1993) (“[A] criminal 
statute is void for vagueness unless it . . . provides explicit 
standards for those who apply the statute, in order to avoid 
arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement and the delegation of 
basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for 
resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis.” (internal 
quotations, brackets, and citation omitted)) . 
 Whether a purchaser is charged under subsection (1)(a) or 
(1)(b), the State must prove that the purchaser  “engaged” 
themselves in prostitution by paying, agreeing to pay, or 
offering to pay another person to engage in sexual conduct.  As 
applied to the purchasers of sexual conduct, subsections (1)(a) 
and (1)(b) prohibit the same conduct but prescribe different 
punishment.  Because elements of proof essential to conviction
 
under HRS §§ 712-1200(1)(a) and (1)(b) are the same , as applied 
to purchasers of sexual conduct, the second part of the Modica 
                                                                               
(. . . continued) 
 While the factual bases for these charges are not present in the 
record, the fact that such amendments were possible supports our conclusion 
that prosecutorial discretion, not the text of the statute or intent of the 
legislature, determined whether defendants were prosecuted under HRS § 712-
1200(1)(b) instead of HRS § 712-1200(1)(a). ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 16test is met.   Our holding is also consistent with the ICA’s 
holding in Hatori that a Modica violation exists where the 
lesser felony prohibited a broader range of conduct, but the 
conduct at issue would always constitute a violation of both the 
lesser and greater felonies.  Hatori, 92 Hawai ‘i at 227, 990 P.2d 
at 125. 
3. The punishment for HRS § 712-1200(1)(b) is greater 
than the punishment  for HRS § 712- 1200(1)(a)  
 
The final question in the Modica inquiry is whether the  
punishment for the offense with which the defendant was charged 
is greater than the punishment for the alternative offense.  58 
Haw. at 251, 567 P.2d at 420.   
 
Prostitution, under either subsection of HRS § 712- 1200(1), 
is a petty misdemeanor.  HRS § 712- 1200(3) (2014).  First time 
offenders face a mandatory fine of no less than $500 but no more 
than $1000, with the possibility of up to thirty days of 
imprisonment, unless the court has granted a deferred plea under 
HRS Chapter 853.  HRS § 712-1200(4)(a) (2014); HRS § 853-1(c) 
(2014).  Granting a DAG/DANC plea is discretionary.  HRS § 853-
1(a).  Under HRS § 853-4(a)(13)(V) (2014), the deferral statute 
is not applicable if the offense charged is a violation of HRS § 
712-1200(1)(b).   
                     
16 We emphasize that this “as applied” analysis is appropriate because the 
amendment history of HRS § 712-1200(1) created uncertainty in the application 
of previously understood language, which in turn significantly undermined the 
legislative guidance provided by the text of the statute.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
33 
  Ineligibility for a DAG/DANC plea means that all defendants 
charged under HRS § 712- 1200(1)(b) are subject to the 
aforementioned penalties for the crime of prostitution.  Without 
more specific guiding language in subsection (1)(a), it is the 
prosecutor’s charging decision that ultimately determines 
whether a defendant is charged under subsection (1)(a) or 
(1)(b), and can attempt to seek deferral, or must face the 
ordinary statutory penalty.  Because the ability of first- time 
offenders to seek a DAG/DANC has significant effect on their 
potential punishment, HRS § 712 -1200(1)(b) carries a harsher 
punishment than subsection (1)(a), and the third part of the 
Modica test is satisfied.   
 Based on the plain language of HRS §§ 712- 1200(1)(a) and 
(1)(b), as they existed at the time Petitioners were charged, we 
conclude that Petitioners’ charges violated the Modica rule.17  
The ICA erred in holding that Petitioners’ due process and equal 
protection rights had not been violated.   
D. Dismissal With Prejudice 
 Citing State v. Estencion , 63 Haw. 264, 625 P.2d 1040 
                     
17 The potential for the  Modica violation challenged by Petitioners was 
created when HRS § 712-1200(1)(b) was excluded from the DAG/DANC statute on 
April 25, 2013.  See S.B. 194, 27th Leg., Reg. Sess. (2013)  (amending HRS § 
853-4, effective April 25, 2013) .   
 The 2016 amendment to HRS § 712-1200(1)(a)  added the phrase “in return” 
to subsection (1)(a) to further distinguish it from subsection (1)(b).  H.B. 
2561, 28th Leg., Reg. Sess. (2016).  O nly defendants who were otherwise 
eligible for a DAG/DANC plea and were convicted under HRS § 712-1200(1)(b) 
between April 25, 2013 and July 1, 2016 may be affected by the issue 
Petitioners present here.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 (1981), the State asserted before the ICA that the district 
court erred in dismissing the charges with prejudice, without 
engaging in “any on the record balancing of the factors 
necessary to determine whether dismissal should be with or 
without prejudice.”   
 
The Estencion  factors must be analyzed when dismissing a 
case for violation of Hawai ʻi Rules of Penal Procedure (“HRPP”) 
Rule 48.  In Estencion , we adopted factors listed in the Federal 
Speedy Trial Act § 101, 18 U.S.C. § 3162(a)(1) (Supp. 1980), to 
determine whether a charge should be dismissed with or without 
prejudice for a HRPP Rule 48 violation, stating: 
In determining whether to dismiss the case with or without 
prejudice, the court shall consider, among others, each of 
the following  factors
: the seriousness of the offense; the 
facts and the circumstances of the case which led to the 
dismissal; and the impact of a reprosecution on the 
administration of this chapter and on the administration of 
justice. 
 
63 Haw. at 269, 625 P.2d at 1044 (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3162(a)(1) 
(Supp. 1980)).   
 
We have yet to set out factors for a trial court to 
consider to determine whether a criminal charge should be 
dismissed before conviction with or without prejudice based on a 
Modica violation.  In general, t
rial courts have the inherent 
power to dismiss a charge , and although the exercise of that 
power is not limited to “extraordinary situations,” it must be 
done “upon ‘balancing the interest of the state against ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
35 
 fundamental fairness to a defendant with the added ingredient of 
the orderly functioning of the court system[.]’”   State v. 
Hinton, 120 Hawai‘ i 265, 27
7, 204 P.3d 484, 496  (2009) (quoting 
State v. Moriwake, 65 Haw. 47, 56, 647 P.2d 705, 712 (1982)).  
In State v. Fukuoka , 141 Hawaiʻ i 48, 404 P.3d 314 (2017), a HRPP 
Rule 48 case, we noted that in State v. Coyaso , 73 Haw. 352, 
357, 833 P.2d 66, 69 (1992), we stated that “prejudice to the 
defendant may [also] be a relevant consideration in the trial 
court's decision to dismiss wit h or without prejudice” 
under HRPP Rule 48.  Fukuoka, 141 Hawai ʻi at 56, 404 P.3d at 322.   
 Estencion and its progeny lay out appropriate  
considerations for a trial court in its determination of whether 
to dismiss a criminal charge with or without prejudice in the 
context of a pre-conviction dismissal for a Modica
 violation.  
We hold that in the context of a pre-
conviction  dismissal for a 
Modica violation, in determining whether to dismiss the case 
with or without prejudice, the court must consider each of the 
following factors:  the seriousness of the offense, the facts 
and the circumstances of the case 
that led to the dismissal, the 
impact of a reprosecution on the administration of justice, and 
prejudice to the defendant.  Estencion  referred to the 
delineated factors as being “among others”; therefore, a court 
may also consider other factors it deems relevant.  The court 
must, however, articulate the reasons for its decision to ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
36 
 dismiss with or without prejudice.  Cf.
 Fukuoka, 141 Hawai ʻi at 
65, 404 P.3d at 331 (“In analyzing whether to dismiss a case 
with or without prejudice for a violation of HRPP Rule 48, the 
court must evaluate each Estencion factor and determine whether 
the balance of factors weighs in favor of permitting or 
prohibiting re prosecution.”)   
 In this case, as argued by the State, the district court 
dismissed the charges with prejudice without providing any 
reasons for its decision.  We therefore remand these cases to 
the district court for application of the 
appropriate factors 
regarding whether the charges should be dismissed with or 
without prejudice. 
IV. Conclusion 
 For the reasons stated above, we vacate  the ICA’s July 31, 
2017 judgment on appeal, filed pursuant to its June 30, 2017 
SDO, which vacated the district cou rt’s October 16, 2015 order,  
and we remand these cases to t he district court  for further 
proceedings consistent with this opinion.
