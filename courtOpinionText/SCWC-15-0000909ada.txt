JUNE 6, 2019  
I.  Introduction 
On March 31, 2015, Petitioner/Defendant
-Appellant, Ronald 
Melvin Barnes (“Barnes”), was convicted by a jury in the Circuit  
 
 
   
 
         
  
  
   
                         ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Court of the First Circuit (“circuit court”)1 of four counts of 
sexual assault in the first degree as to a minor and one count 
of sexual assault in the first degree as to another minor.  
After a hearing, the circuit court granted the State’s motion 
and sentenced Barnes to a term of twenty years for each count, 
with terms for four of the counts as to one minor to be served 
concurrently, and the term for the remaining count as to the 
other minor to be served consecutively to the foregoing terms. 
Barnes asserts on certiorari that the circuit court abused 
its discretion in sentencing him to consecutive terms of 
imprisonment and that the ICA gravely erred in affirming the 
circuit court’s judgment. 
Although the points raised by Barnes on appeal as bases for  
challenging the consecutive terms lack merit, based on State v. 
Barrios, 139
 Hawaiʻi 321, 389 P.3d 916 (2016), and  State v. 
Kamanaʻ o, 103 Haw
aiʻi 315, 82 P.3d 401 (2003),  we hold the 
circuit court plainly erred by consider  ing  Barnes’s refusal to 
admit guilt in imposing his sentence.   Accordingly, we vacate 
the ICA’s October 2, 2017 Judgment on Appeal and the portion of 
the circuit court’s  October 26, 2015  Judgment of Conviction and   
Sentence (“judgment”)  sentencing Barnes, and remand to the 
circuit court for resentencing.

  2   HRS § 706  -601 (2014) required that  a pre -sentence diagnosis and report 
be prepared regarding Barnes.  HRS §  706- 602 (2014) then provides in relevant 
part as follows:  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
A. Circuit Court Hearing on the State’s Motion for Consecutive 
Sentencing 
Following Barnes’ s trial, on May 28, 2015, the State moved  
for consecutive term sentencing.  A  presentence investigation 
and report (commonly referred to as  a “PSI”)  was filed on June 
22, 2015, in which the  probation officer  stated:  2 
On June 3, 2015, an attempt was made to complete the 
presentence investigation (PSI)  when this probation officer 
(PO) met the defendant at Oahu Community Correctional 
Center (OCCC) where the defendant was detained.  The 
defendant reported that he received the PSI questionnaire 
that was sent to him but related that he would not be 
participating in the PSI.  He further stated that, if this PO wanted information on him, PO should contact the state 
of Washington as he said he would not be signing any 
documents.  
Pre- sentence diagnosis, notice to victims, and report. 
(1) The pre -sentence diagnosis and report shall be made by 
personnel assigned to the court or other agency designated by the court and shall include: 
(a) An analysis of the circumstances attending the 
commission of the crime; 
(b) The defendant ’s history of delinquency or criminality, 
physical and mental condition, family situation and background, economic status and capacity to make 
restitution or to make reparation to the victim or victims of the defendant ’s crimes for loss or damage caused 
thereby, education, occupation, and personal habits; (c) Information made available by the victim or other 
source concerning the effect that the crime committed by 
the defendant has had upon said victim, including but not 
limited to, any physical or psychological harm or financial 
loss suffered; 
(d) Information concerning defendant ’s compliance or non -
compliance with any order issued under section 806 -11 
[regarding disposal of firearms]; and (e) 
Any other matters that the reporting person or agency 
deems relevant or the court directs to be incl
uded. 
. . . .

   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
The defendant was given the opportunity to make a 
verbal statement/comment about the present matters, in 
which he replied that he is planning to file an appeal in 
the instant matters ,  as well as an appeal in Washington for 
his case there.  According to the defendant, he was convicted of sexual assault in Washington and started serving his term of incarceration there from July 18, 2008 
to October 10, 2013.  He reported that he was brought to 
Hawaii/OCCC on January 30, 2013, and was allowed to serve 
the remainder of his jail sentence in Hawaii.  He said that 
he is now on probation status o
n his Washington case, which 
he believes expires in 2016 or 2017.  
Furthermore, the defendant reported that he is 
“innocent” of all the sexual assault charges against him.
   
He said that one of the victims had a sexually transmitted 
disease that the defendant never had, so he explained that 
it meant that she got the disease from someone else.  He 
also indicated that the victim(s) may have been sexually 
assaulted, but that he was not the perpetrator, and said 
that it was someone else that was either dating the victim’s mother or living with them at that time.  Due to 
the defendant’s unwillingness to participate in the 
presentence investigation interview, only the following 
information is being provided to the court . . . .  
(Emphases added). 
The sentencing  hearing was held on October 26, 2015.  At 
the hearing, the State explained that four of the five   counts of 
sexual assault in the first degree related to one child 
complainant, and the remaining count of sexual assault in the 
first degree related  to a second child complainant.  According 
to the State, consecutive term sentencing was  appropriate and 
reasonable, and reflected the seriousness of the crimes  
committed against the two minors.  The State emphasized  that 
Barnes had victimized two different children, and therefore    
should not be sentenced in the same manner as if he had only victimized one.

 And my client will not be making a statement on the 
advice of counsel.  He intends to appeal the case.

         3    Factors to be considered in imposing a sentence.   The  
court, in determining the particular sentence to be 
imposed, shall consider:      ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
In response, Barnes’s counsel  asserted that there was no 
justification for a consecutive sentence under State v. Hussein, 
122 Hawaiʻ i 495, 229 P.3d 313 (2010),  as nothing in Barnes’s  
personal history suggested that he was a sexual predator.    
Defense counsel also  noted that based on his advice, Barnes 
would not be making a statement as he intended to appeal the 
case.  The circuit court then conducted 
a colloquy with Barnes  
before granting the State’s motion:  
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: . . .  So based upon those factors, 
judge, we’re asking that --we’re submitting that there is 
no justification for consecutive over concurrent sentencing in this particular case. 
THE COURT: Okay, Mr. Barnes, I just need it from your 
mouth.  You have every right to say what you wish before sentencing.  Do you wish to say anything? 
THE DEFENDANT: Not in this court, Your Honor. 
THE COURT:   All right.  Okay, the court takes judicial 
notice of the files and records in this case and of trial, 
 and I considered the  factors under HRS Section 706 -606, [ ]  3
(1) The nature and circumstances of the offense and 
the history and characteristics of the defendant; 
(2) The need for the sentence imposed: 
(a) To reflect the seriousness of the offense, 
to promote respect for law, and to provide just punishment 
for the offense; 
(b) To afford adequate deterrence to criminal 
conduct; 
(c) To protect the public from f
urther crimes 
of the defendant; and 
(d) To provide the defendant with needed 
educational or vocational training, medical care, or other 
correctional treatment in the most effective manner; 
(3) The kinds of sentences available; and 
(. . . continued)

 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
all of which a sentencing court must consider with respect 
to the motion for consecutive sentencing.  These factors 
include the nature and circumstances of the offense, which 
are most serious as they involved the sexual molestation of 
two young children as to whom defendant was in a position 
of trust as the husband of the children ’s natural mother.  
The conduct involved a variety of acts to the two children, 
both of whom were under the age of 14 years.  The victim 
impact statements and some of what the court observed 
during trial showed that these two children apparently 
suffered harm from the sexual assaults, and that harm apparently remains with the children notwithstanding 
counseling. 
In addition, characteristics of the defendant are 
another factor that the court must consider.   The 
defendant’ s conduct with regard to these sexual acts 
spanned a substantial period of time and involved acts of 
deception both as to the children and to adults.  In 
addition, while the defendant certainly has a right to 
appeal all matters that are appealable, he has been uncooperative in the preparation of any aspect of the 
presentence report and does not appear to have expressed 
any sadness that the two children suffered harm of any 
kind.    
In addition, the sentence is required to reflect the 
seriousness of these offenses to not one but two small 
children and to promote respect for the laws of our state 
and to provide just punishment under the totality of the 
relevant circumstances.  
Based upon the factors which the court has just 
discussed under 706 -606, the sentence is necessary to 
provide adequate deterrence to criminal conduct and to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, especially against children.  The motion for consecutive 
sentencing is granted to the extent that defendant is  
sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment in Counts 1, 3, 5, 6, and [13], and he will serve Count [13] consecutively to the  
other four counts. The first four, 1, 3, 5, and 6, shall be 
served concurrently with one another, and Count [13] will 
be served consecu
tively to Counts 1, 3, 5, and 6.  
(Emphasis added).

(4) The need to avoid unwarranted sentence 
disparities among defendants with similar records who have 
been found guilty of similar conduct.

  Judgment was entered on October 26, 2015 reflecting the 
consecutive terms of imprisonment.     
   B. Appeal to the ICA 
  
 
     ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Barnes timely appealed his convictions to the ICA on a 
single point of error: “[w]hether the trial court abused its 
discretion in sentencing [Barnes] to terms of imprisonment in 
Counts 1, 3, 5 and 6 for the offense of SEXUAL ASSAULT IN THE 
FIRST DEGREE to run consecutively to the term of imprisonment in 
Count 13 for the offense of SE
XUAL ASSAULT IN THE FIRST DEGREE, 
twenty years as to each count.”  
The ICA  rejected Barnes’s challenge and affirmed the 
circuit court’s October 26, 2015 Judgment .   See  State v. Barnes,  
No. CAAP-15-0000909, at 5 (App. Apr. 13, 2017) (SDO).   The ICA  
noted that a sentencing  judge has broad discretion to order  
multiple terms of imprisonment to run concurrently or 
consecutively, and that although a sentencing judge must  
consider the factors set forth in HRS § 706-606 and state on the 
record at the time of sentencing its reasons for imposing a 
consecutive sentence, “[a]bsent clear evidence to the contrary, 
it is presumed that a sentencing court will have considered all 
factors before imposing concurrent or consecutive terms of 
imprisonment under HRS §  706-606.”  Barnes, SDO at 3 (quoting  
State v. Kong, 131 Hawaii 94, 102, 315 P.3d 720, 728 (2013)).   
7  
 
 
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
The ICA concluded the circuit court had appropriately 
considered the HRS § 706-606 factors, including the nature and 
circumstances of the offenses, the need to provide just 
punishment for the crimes committed,  the need for the sentence 
to promote respect for the law, and to afford deterrence to criminal conduct and to protect the public from further crimes.  
Barnes, SDO at 4-5.  The ICA also noted the circuit court’s 
statement that Barnes “‘d[id] not appear to have expressed any 
sadness that the two children suffered harm of any kind[,]’” and that Barnes had been  uncooperative in the preparation of the  
PSI.  Barnes, SDO at 4.    
The ICA concluded  that although Barnes raised the existence  
of some mitigating factors, such as cooperation with the police 
and lack of a prior criminal history,  “the presence of some 
mitigating factors does not compel this court to conclude that 
the Circuit Court abused its discretion, especially in light of 
the Circuit Court’s clear rationale for imposing a consecutive sentence.”  Barnes, SDO at 5.   The ICA added that it rejected 
any  other “factors” raised by Barnes as they “in essence, 
suggest that he did not sexually assault the minor victims,” 
which is inconsistent with the jury’s verdict and d id not bear  
on the exercise of the circuit court’s discretion in sentencing.  
Id.     
8  
 
 
   C. Certiorari Proceedings 
    
  
Barnes argues  the circuit court abused its discretion 
because Barnes had “no unrelated prior criminal cases a nd no 
prior opportunities for rehabilitation, ”  which contrasts with 
the defendants in various other cases who were sentenced to 
consecutive sentences.   Further, Barnes argues  the record shows: 
(1) there was “no reporting by the complaining witnesses until years later”; (2) there was evidence at trial that “the police 
detectives coached the complaining witnesses during interviews”; 
and (3) interrogations of Barnes by police detectives went 
unrecorded.  The State did not file a response to Barnes’ s  
application for certiorari.    ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
On certiorari, Barnes  “seeks a remand for resentencing” on 
the grounds that the circuit court abused its discretion when it  
imposed a consecutive term of imprisonment:  
QUESTION[] PRESENTED 
Whether this Honorable Court, in the exercise of its 
certiorari jurisdiction, ought to vacate the Summary 
Disposition Order (SDO) . . . of the [ICA], which upheld: 
the October 26, 2015 Judgment of Conviction and Sentence 
(Judgment) filed in the Family Court of the First Circuit 
Court.  
Barnes seeks a remand for resentencing.  Petitioner 
maintained on appeal in the ICA that the Family Court of 
the First Circuit erred by sentencing Petitioner to terms 
of imprisonment in Counts 1, 3, 5 and 6 for the offense of SEXUAL ASSAULT IN THE FIRST DEGREE to  run consecutively to 
the term of imprisonment in Count 13 for the offense of SEXUAL ASSAULT IN THE FIRST DEGREE, twenty years as to each 
count.  
9  
 
 
    
  A. Consecutive Sentencing 
 
  
  
  B. Plain Error 
 When necessary to serve the ends of justice, this court 
will consider issues that have not been preserved below or 
raised on appeal.   See  Hawaiʻi Rules of Penal Procedure (“HRPP”) 
Rule 52(b)  (2016) (allowing plain error to be noticed although 
not brought to attention of trial court);  Hawai
ʻi Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (“HRAP”) Rule 28(b)(4)  (2010) (permitting 
point of error not presented on appeal to be noticed as plain 
error);  HRAP Rule 40.1(d)(1)  (2015) (allowing question not 
raised to be noticed as plain error).  It is “firmly 
established” that the relevant inquiry when evaluating whether  a 
trial court’s plain error may be noticed is whether the error 
affected substantial rights.   See  HRPP Rule 52(b)  (“Plain  error.   
Plain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be 
noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
III. Standards of Review 
In general, the applicable standard of review in sentencing 
matters is whether the court committed a plain and manifest 
abuse of discretion in its decision.”  Kamanaʻ o, 118 Hawai ʻi at 
221, 188 P.3d at 735 (citations omitted). 
A court must, however, state its reasons as to why a 
consecutive sentence rather than a concurrent sentence was required.  See Hussein , 122 Hawai
ʻi at  509, 229 P.3d at  327.   
10  
 
 
   IV. Discussion 
   
    A. The Circuit Court Did Not Commit a Clear and Manifest Abuse 
of Discretion by Imposing a Consecutive Sentence 
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
court.”).  Thus, a reviewing court has discretion to correct 
plain error when the error is “not harmless beyond a reasonable 
doubt.”   HRPP Rule 52(a)  (2016) (“Harmless error.   Any error, 
defect, irregularity or variance which does not affect 
substantial rights shall be disregarded.”) ; see also State v. U ʻi   , 
142 Hawai
ʻi 287, 297, 418 P.3d 628, 638 (2018)  (citations and 
footnotes omitted).  
On certiorari, Barnes essentially raises the same arguments 
as he did before the ICA
, arguing that the circuit court abused 
its discretion by imposing a consecutive sentence.  A trial 
court’s sentence is reviewed for a plain and manifest abuse of 
discretion, but when imposing a consecutive sentence, a court must state its reasons as to why a consecutive rather than a 
concurrent sentence was required.   See  Hussein, 122 Hawaiʻi at 
509, 229 P.3d at 327.  This requirement serves the p 
urposes of 
(1) identifying the facts or circumstances within the range of 
statutory factors the court considered important in imposing a 
consecutive sentence, which provides a meaningful rationale to 
the defendant, the victim, and the public, and (2) confi  rming 
for the defendant, the victim, the public, and the appellate court, that the decision to impose a consecutive sentence was 
11  
 
 
  The ICA did not err in concluding that the circuit court 
provided sufficient reasoning for its decision to impose a 
consecutive sentence.  Although the circuit court  did not 
specifically address the statutory factor that Barnes had  “no 
unrelated prior criminal cases and no prior opportunities for 
rehabilitation,”  a “sentencing court is not required to 
articulate and explain its conclusions with respect to every 
factor listed in HRS § 706-606. . . .  [T]he sentencing court is 
required to articulate its reasoning only with respect to those 
factors it relies on in imposing consecutive sentences.”  Kong, 
131 Hawai i at 102, 315 P.3d at 728 (citations omitted).   The 
circuit court’s failure to specifically address mitigating factors argued by the defense 
when it imposed a consecutive   
sentence did not amount to a clear and manifest abuse of  
discretion under the circumstances of this case  .  
 
   
  
   
   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
deliberate, rational, and fair.  See  Hussein, 122 Hawai ʻi   at 509-
10, 229 P.3d at 327-28.  
Additionally, the ICA did not err by concluding that the 
“mitigating” facts Barnes asserted in his ICA brief — such as 
that police interrogations of Barnes went unrecorded, or that 
the children did not come forth with their allegations 
immediately — do not mean that the sentencing court abused its 
discretion. Rather, as stated by the ICA, Barnes appears to 
12  
 
 
   
   B. The Circuit Court Plainly Erred When It Considered Barnes’s 
Refusal to Admit Guilt in Imposing His Sentence 
 
 
 
  
   
     
 In sentencing Barnes,  the circuit court stated the  
following: “In addition, while the defendant certainly has a 
right to appeal all matters that are appealable, he has been 
uncooperative in the preparation of any aspect of the 
presentence report and  does not appear to have expressed any 
sadness that the two childre n suffered harm of any kind.”  
Accordingly, we address this aspect of the circuit court’s reasoning, which was quoted by the ICA, based on a plain error 
review.   See Barnes , SDO at 4.    ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
suggest that the jury erred in its verdict, but that issue is 
not the subject of this appeal.  
Pursuant to the Fifth Amendment to the United States 
Constitution and Article I, section 10 of the Constitution of 
the State of Hawai ʻi, a criminal defendant has the right to 
remain silent, which is a privilege against self
-incrimination; 
this right “provides us with some of our most treasured 
protections — preservation of our autonomy, privacy, and dignity 
against the threat of state [coercion] .”  Kamanaʻ o
, 103 Hawai ʻi 
at 320, 82 P.3d at 406 (citation omitted). “Time has not shown 
that protection from the evils against which this safeguard was directed is needless or unwarranted.”  Ullmann v. United States, 
350 U.S. 422, 426 (1956).  
13  
 
 
  Where a defendant’s substantial rights have been affected, 
plain error review is appropriate.  See  State v. Miller, 122 
Hawaiʻ i 92, 100, 223 P.3d 157, 165 (2010); see also  HRPP  Rule 
52(b)  (“Plain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may 
be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of 
the court.”)
.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
The “distinction between imposing a harsher sentence upon a 
defendant based on his or her lack of remorse, on the one hand, 
and punishing a defendant for his or her refusal to admit 
guilt,”  is “subtle, yet meaningful.”   Kamanaʻ o, 103 Hawai ʻi at  
321–22, 82 P.3d at  407
–08 (citation omitted).   Although a 
sentencing court “has broad discretion in imposing a sentence, 
and can consider the candor, conduct, remorse[,] and background  
of the defendant,” State v. Mikasa, 111 Hawai ʻi 1, 8, 135 P.3d 
1044, 1051 (2006) (quoting State v. Nunes, 72 Haw. 521, 526, 824 
P.2d 837, 840 (1992)), it “may not impose an enhanced sentence 
based on a defendant’s refusal to admit guilt with respect to an  
offense the conviction of which he intends to appeal.”  Barrios, 
139 Hawaiʻ i at 33  8, 389 P.3d  at 933 (quoting  Kamanaʻ o, 103 Hawai ʻi 
at 320, 82 P.3d at   406).   Based on the   circuit court’s  quoted 
language above, the circuit court   improperly based its sentence,  
in part, on  Barnes’s refusal to admit guilt.    
In Kamanaʻ o, this court adopted the Michigan Supreme Court’s 
three-factor analysis set out in People v. Wesley, 428  Mich. 
14  
 
 
  
                         
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
708, 411 N.W.2d 159  (1987), to ascertain   whether a sentencing  
court erroneously relied on a  defendant’s refusal to admit guilt  
in imposing a sentence.  See Kamanaʻ o  , 103 Hawaiʻ i at 323, 82 
P.3d at 409 (citation omitted).  We quoted the following passage  
from Wesley  regarding the three
-factor analysis:  
(1)  the defendant ’s maintenance of innocence after 
conviction, (2) the judge ’s attempt to get the defendant to 
admit guilt, and (3) the appearance that[,] had the 
defendant affirmatively admitted guilt, his sentence would 
not have been so severe. . . .   [I]f there is an indication 
of the three factors, then the sentence was likely to have 
been improperly influenced by the defendant’s persistence 
in his innocence. [ ]   If, however, the record shows that the 
court did no more than address the factor of remorsefulness as it bore upon defendant ’s rehabilitation, then the 
court’ s reference to a defendant ’s persistent claim of 
innocence will not amount to error requiring reversal.  4 
Kamanaʻ o, 103 Hawai ʻi at 323, 82 P .3d at 409 (citation omitted  )  
(emphasis added); see also Barrios  , 139 Hawai ʻi at 338, 389 P.3d 
at 933 (quoting id.).  As noted above, the analysis we adopted  
includes the manner in which the three factors  are examined: we  
stated  “if there is an  indication” of the three factors, “then 
the sentence was likely  to have been improperly influenced by 
the defendant’s persistence in his innocence.”   Kamanaʻo, 103 
Hawaiʻ i at 323, 82 P.3d at 409 (citation omitted)   (emphasis 
15 4   The Dissent erroneously asserts that this opinion “reformulates ”  the 
Kamanaʻ o  analysis into a rigid “if -then” test, which is satisfied if there is 
an ‘indication’ of the factors.”   Dissent, Part I.   However, we clearly  
stated in Kamanaʻ o  that “ if  there is an indication of the three factors, then  
the sentence was likely to have been improperly influenced by the defendant’s 
persistence of his innocence.”   Kamanaʻ o, 103 Hawai ʻi at 323, 82 P.3d at 409

 5added).   Because of the “subtle” difference between permissible 
and impermissible considerations at sentencing, the test is 
structured to safeguard the defendant’s constitutional right 
against self-incrimination.       
 In this case, there is clearly an indication of t he first 
factor, the defendant’s maintenance of innocence after 
conviction, as Barnes maintained his innocence after conviction.     
There is also an indication of the second factor , the 
judge’s attempt to get the defendant to admit guilt,  based on 
this court’s modified interpretation of that factor  to include 
when a sentencing court confirms the defendant is maintaining a 
claim of innocence.  See  Kamana ʻo, 103 Hawaiʻi at 323-24, 82 P.3d 
at 409-10 (“Regarding the second factor, although the circuit 
court did not coerce Kamana ʻo into admitting culpability for his 
convictions, . . . in ruling on the prosecution ’s motion, the 
circuit court did confirm with Kamana ʻo his persistence in 
maintaining his claim of innocence . . . .” (emphasis added)) ; 
see also Barrios, 139 Hawaiʻi at 338, 389 P.3d at 933 .     This 
confirmation may come from the PSI, statements of defense

 The Dissent asserts that in  Kamanaʻ o, we “analyzed each of the factors 
separately and then weighed them as a whole[.]”   Dissent, Part III.A.1.  We 
disagree.  We analyzed if there was an indication of the three factors, then  
stated that the third factor “weigh[ed] heavily in favor of vacating 
Kamanao’s sentence. ”  Kamanaʻo, 103 Hawaiʻi at 323 -24, 82 P.3d at 409 -10.

counsel, or the defendant. In Barnes’ s case, confirmations came 
from all three methods. 
Before the sentencing hearing, as noted above, a judiciary   
probation officer 
had prepared a PSI, which is an integral  
component of almost all sentencing decisions in our circuit 
courts.   PSIs must be prepared and be considered by the 
sentencing judge for almost all felony convictions before 
sentencing can occur.  See  HRS § 706-  601(1)(a) (2014) (   “Except 
as provided in subsections  (3) and (4), the court shall order a 
pre-sentence correctional diagnosis of the defendant and accord 
due consideration to a written report of the diagnosis before 
imposing sentence where . . . [t]he defendant has been convicted   
of a felony[.]”).  6 
Barnes’s PSI  reflected that Barnes had told the probation  
officer “he [was]  planning to file an appeal ”  in the instant 
matters, and that  he was “innocent of all the sexual assault 
charges against him. ”  PSIs must be provided to the parties, and 
the parties must be  given an opportunity to request corrections 
before sentencing can occur.  See  HRS §  706-604(2) (2014)   (“The 
court shall furnish to the defendant or the defendant ’s counsel 
and to the prosecuting attorney a copy of the report of any pre-
sentence diagnosis . . . and afford fair opportunity, if the  
defendant or the prosecuting attorney so requests, to controvert 
17 6   See supra n.2.     
 
 
   
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
or supplement them. ”).   In addition, at the beginning of 
Barnes’s sentencing hearing, the circuit court confirmed that  
neither the State nor the defense was  requesting any changes to 
the PSI.  Thus, defense counsel also  confirmed to the circuit 
court that Barnes was continuing to maintain his innocence, as 
he had to the probation officer preparing the PSI.   Furthermore, 
after defense counsel had stated at the sentencing hearing that 
Barnes “w[ould] not be making a statement on the advice of 
counsel [as] [h]e intends to appeal the case,” the circuit court 
asked Barnes for confirmation  , stating,  “Okay, Mr. Barnes, I 
just need it from your mouth.   You have every right to say what 
you wish before sentencing.  Do you wish to say anything? ”   
Barnes responded in the negative, thereby reconfirming his 
intent to maintain his innocence.   
As to the third factor, “the appearance that[,] had the 
defendant affirmatively admitted guilt, his sentence would not 
have been so severe,” the circuit court stated before imposing 
the consecutive sentence that Barnes was “uncooperative in the 
preparation of any aspect of the presentence report” and “d[id] 
not appear to have expressed any sadness that the two children 
suffered harm of any kind.”  The record is therefore clear that 
the circuit court consider ed Barnes’s failure to “express[] any 
sadness that the two children suffered harm of any kind” when 
sentencing him, even though Barnes could not have “expressed” 
18  
 
 
                          
    
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
such specific “sadness” without abrogating his right to remain 
silent at trial and at the sentencing hearing.   Thus, Barnes 
cannot be penalized for failing to “express” himself or 
communicate, even if, as the Dissent suggests, it is possible to 
“express[] sadness . . . without admitting . . . guilt.”   
Dissent, Part III.B.2.              8 7 
As stated above,  Barnes’s “uncooperative” nature with 
respect to the PSI  was based on his continued  professed 
innocence.  In other words, Barnes’s maintenance of his 
innocence is inextricably linked to the manner in which he 
responded to the presentence investigation   and his silence (and 
hence failure to “express sadness”) at the sentencing hearing .  
Thus, when discussing the HRS § 706  -606 factors, the sentencing 
7   Further illustrating this point is the Dissent’s strained distinction 
between Barnes’s failure to “express[] sadness that the two children suffered 
harm of any kind” —  as admonished by the circuit court —  and a failure to 
show remorse.  According to the Di ssent, the sentencing judge’s comment that 
Barnes did not “express sadness” does not amount to commenting on a lack of 
remorse because “one can convey ‘sadness’ . . . without any admission of 
wrongdoing.”    Dissent, Part III.B.2.   Even if this were possible, and even if 
this were the sentencing court’s aim, the Kamanaʻo  test requires only an 
“appearance” of the third factor; here, there nevertheless is an appearance  
that, had Barnes “affirmatively admitted guilt, his sentence would not have been so severe.” 
  
8   Further, the Dissent conflates situations in which a “defendant [has] 
admit[ted] certain facts which, while insufficient to convict, indicate 
wrongful action” and “lack of remorse regarding the admitted facts ,” with a  
negative inference drawn from a defendant’s silence by a sentencing judge.   
Wesley, 411 N.W.2d at 167 (Brickley, J., concurring)  (footnote omitted) 
(emphasis added).  In the former situation, “[i]t would seem appropriate to 
consider a defendant’s callousness or indifference to the plight of the 
victim, even if he continues to maintain his innocence.”  Id.   However, it is 
not appropriate in the latter situation, when a defendant’s indifference to 
the “plight of the victim” actually relates  to the defendant’s right to 
remain silent.  
19  
 
 
    
 
  
  
                         
   9   The Dissent suggests that the circuit court’s reference to Barnes’s 
lack of cooperation in the preparation of the presentence report does not  
amount to commenting on Barnes’s refusal to admit guilt.   See  Dissent, Part 
III.B.3.   This suggestion does not adequately consider, however, the circuit 
court’s preface to its statement: “In addition, while the defendant certainly 
has a right to appeal all matters that are appealable , he has been 
uncooperative in the preparation of any aspect of the presentence report . . 
. .”  (Emphasis added) .   The circuit court thus juxtaposed Barnes’s lack of 
cooperation with his right to appeal his conviction, i.e., his claim of 
innocence.  Accordingly, when the sentencing judge’s full comments regarding 
the HRS § 706- 606 factors are considered, as urged by the Dissent, there is 
clearly “an appearance ” of the third factor.  The Dissent concludes ,  “there 
is no appearance that,  had Barnes affirmatively admitted guilt, his sentence 
would not have been so severe .”   Dissent, Part III.B.3.   This is not the 
applicable test, and even if it were, this is plainly not the case.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
court faulted Barnes   ’s persistence in his innocence.   
Accordingly, although the primary justification raised by the 
State’s Motion was that there were two, not one, child victims 
in this matter, and the circuit court repeatedly emphasized that 
two children, not one, were harmed based on the circuit c ourt’s 
foregoing comments, there is clearly an “appearance”  that  had 
the defendant affirmatively admitted guilt, his sentence would 
9 not have been so severe,  and the third factor of the Kamanaʻo  
test is satisfied.  
Although a sentencing court’s reference to a defendant’s 
claim of innocence will not amount to error requiring vacatur 
and resentencing “[i]f . . . the record shows that the court did 
no more than address the factor of remorsefulness as it bore 
upon defendant’s rehabilitation,” that is not the case here as 
the record does not demonstrate that Barnes’s lack of 
cooperation and remorse or empathy were considered by the 
20  
 
 
                          
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
circuit court only  as it pertained to his rehabilitation.  
Kamanaʻ o, 103 Hawai ʻi at 323, 82 P.3d at  409.        
The 
Kamanaʻ o test  is not one where the three factors are 
first individually weighed before being balanced against the 
sentencing court’s other stated considerations , as described  by 
the Dissent.   
See  Dissent, Part III.A.1.  Rather, the test is an 
“if-then” test that follows from the basic tenet that “a 
sentencing court cannot, in whole or in part , base its sentence 
on a defendant’s refusal to admit guilt.”  Wesley, 411 N.W.2d at 
161 (citing People v. Yennior, 282 N.W.2d 920 (Mich. 1977)) 
(emphasis added).  Specifically, this court  held that “ if there 
is an indication  of the three factors, then  the sentence was 
likely to have been improperly influenced by the defendant’s 
persistence in his innocence.”  Kamanaʻo, 103 Hawai ʻi at 323, 89 
P.3d at 409 (citing  Wesley, 411 N.W.2d at 162) (emphasis 
added).   In structuring  the Kamanaʻ o  test in this manner, this 
court recognized the need for safeguards for   “some of our most 
treasured protections –  preservation of our autonomy, privacy, 
and dignity against the threat of state action.”    Kamanaʻo, 103 
Hawaiʻ i at 320, 82 P.3d at 406.     10 
21 10   Indeed, that the Dissent interprets the sentencing court’s statement 
that Barnes was “uncooperative in the preparation of any aspect of the 
presentence report” differently from the Majority  illustrates why  an 
“indication” of the three factors is sufficient to show that “th e sentence 
was likely to have been improperly influenced by the defendant’s persistence 
in his innocence.”   See  Dissent, Part III.B.3.

In the light  that all three factors   are satisfied, there is 
clearly an “indication” that Barnes’s “sentence was likely to 
have been improperly influenced” by his persistence in his 
innocence.  Kamana ʻo, 103 Hawaiʻ i at 323, 82 P. 3d at 409 
(citation omitted).  For these reasons,  
 Barnes’s sentence must  
be vacated so that he may be resentenced.   See Barrios  , 139 
Hawaiʻ i at 339, 389 P.3d at 934 (remanding to the circuit court 
for resentencing) (citation omitted).     
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the ICA’s October 2, 
2017 Judgment on Appeal. We also vaca
te the portion of the 
circuit court’s October 26, 2015 Judgment of Conviction and 
Sentence sentencing Barnes, and remand to the circuit court for 
resentencing, consistent with this opinion.
