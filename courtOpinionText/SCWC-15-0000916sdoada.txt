(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.) 
I. Introduction 
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant Ronald S. Fujiyoshi 
(“Fujiyoshi”) seeks review of the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ 
(“ICA”) September 28, 2018 Judgment on Appeal, entered pursuant 
to its August 31, 2018 Memorandum Opinion, which affirmed the 
District Court of the Third Circuit’s (“district court”) 
Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment entered on November 5,

Fujiyoshi proceeded pro se before the district court. 
The record on appeal does not indicate a valid waiver of 
counsel. We therefore vacate the district court’s judgment and 
remand for further proceedings consistent with this summary 
disposition order. 
II. Background 
A. District Court Proceedings 
On April 2, 2015, Fujiyoshi participated in a 
demonstration on Mauna Kea Access Road with approximately fifty 
to eighty other individuals who opposed construction of the 
Thirty Meter Telescope. Respondent/Plaintiff-Appellee State of 
Hawaiʻi (“State”)  charged Fujiyoshi  with obstructing a highway or 
public passage in violation of Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (“HRS”) § 
711-1105(1)(a) and (5) (2014).2 
At Fujiyoshi’s May 7, 2015 plea hearing, the district 
court conducted a gallery advisory. The court informed the 
present defendants, including Fujiyoshi, of their constitutional 
2 HRS § 711-1105 provides in relevant part: 
(1) A person commits the offense of obstructing if, 
whether alone or with others and having no legal privilege 
to do so, the person knowingly or recklessly: 
(a) Obstructs any highway or public passage; or 
(b) Provides less than thirty-six inches of space 
f
or passage on any paved public sidewalk. 
. . . . 
(5
) Obstructing is a petty misdemeanor if the 
person persists in the conduct specified in subsection (1) 
after a warning by a law enforcement officer; otherwise it 
is a violation. 
2             
 
        
           
          
            
            
    
 For  those  of  you  who  want  to  waive  your  right  to  an  
attorney  that  is  also  possible.   If  you  do,  I’m  going  to  
give  you  a  form  to  fill  out  waiving  your  right  to  an  
attorney.   Let  me  explain  to  you  that  if  you  choose  to  
represent  yourself  you  understand  the  Court  cannot  help  
yourself  -- cannot  help  you  in  any  way.  
           
           
             
     
 In  a  trial,  if  you  asked  for  a  trial,  the  State  is  
required  to  prove  every  element  of  the  offense  beyond  a  
reasonable  doubt.   Proof  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  means  
that  you  are  presumed  to  be  innocent  of  the  charge  unless  
and  until  the  State  proves  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  that  
you  are  guilty.  
 Reasonable  doubt  is  a  doubt  in  a  person’s  mind  about  
a  defendant’s  guilt  which  arises  from  the  evidence  
presented  or  from  the  lack  of  evidence  and  which  is  based  
upon  reason  and  common  sense.   This  means  that  you  cannot  
be  found  guilty  upon  mere  suspicion  or  upon  evidence  which  
only  shows  that  you  are  probably  guilty.  
 If  you  represent  yourself  you  will  be  expected  to  
understand  and  follow  the  Hawaii  Rules  of  Evidence,  the  
Hawaii  Rules  of  Penal  Procedure,  and  the  law,  and  that  you  
are  going  to  be  required  to  understand  and  follow  those  
rules.   Trial  proceedings  are  often  complicated  and  legally  
technical.   Participating  in  a  trial  is  often  difficult  
even  for  the  most  experienced  lawyer.  
 Because  you  have  no  formal  training  in  the  law,  if  
you  choose  to  represent  yourself  the  task  of  representing  
yourself  will  be  extremely  difficult.   If  you  do  not  
effectively  represent  yourself  you  cannot  later  complain  
that  you  didn’t  have  effective  assistance  of  counsel.   So  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
right  to  counsel  and  the  general  disadvantages  of  self-
representation:  
THE COURT: Good morning, everyone. 
Before we begin I just want to give you some 
advisements and inform you of your rights. I believe 
everyone who is left on the calendar will have the right to 
have an attorney. If you cannot afford one I will appoint 
one free of charge. 
That if you cannot afford an attorney I will appoint 
one free of charge so that you have a constitutional right 
to have an attorney. You have the right also to hire your 
own attorney to represent you. 
3             
 
              
            
          
           
 
 
           
 
     
      
       
      
    
    
           *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
if you choose to waive your right to an attorney I will ask 
you if you understood those rights and I will ask you to 
also fill out a waiver of right to an attorney. 
Fujiyoshi  signed  a  form  waiving  his  right  to  counsel.   The  court  
engaged  in  the  following  colloquy  with  Fujiyoshi  later  in  the  
morning:  
THE COURT: Alright. Mr. Fujiyoshi, is your mind clear 
this morning? 
THE  DEFENDANT:   Yes.   
THE COURT:
 Do you understand everything that’s going on in 
court? 
THE  DEFENDANT:   Y es,  I  am.  
THE  COURT:   H ow  many  years  of  schooling  have  you  had?  
THE DE
FENDANT: Um, 22. 
THE  COURT:   O kay.   And  you  understand  all  of  those  rights  
that  I  previously  explained  to  you?  
THE DE
FENDANT: Yes, I did. 
THE  COURT:   I s  it  your  choice  to  waive  or  give  up  your  
right  to  an  attorney?  
THE DE
FENDANT: It is my choice. 
THE  CO URT:   You  understand  this  is  a  very  serious  decision?  
THE DE FENDANT: Yes, I do. 
THE  COURT:   Alright.   Is  anyone  forcing  you  to  give  up  this  
right?  
THE
 DEFENDANT: No. 
THE  CO URT:   Are  you  doing  it  knowingly,  voluntarily,  and  
intelligently?  
THE
 DEFENDANT: Yes. 
THE  COURT:   Alright.   Court’s  going  to  find  a  knowing,  
voluntary,  intelligent  waiver  of  right  to  counsel.   And  he  
is  going  to  acknowledge  this  a  second  time.   Okay.  
Fujiyoshi pled not guilty and the case was set for trial. 
4             
 
            
         
             
        
           
          
    
    
            
         
        
         
         
           
   
  In  its  Memorandum  Opinion,  the  ICA  affirmed  the  
district  court’s  judgment,  holding  that  the  complaint  was  
sufficient,  the  conviction  was  supported  by  sufficient  evidence,   
and  the  arrest  did  not  violate  Fujiyoshi’s  constitutional  due  
process  rights.   State  v.  Fujiyoshi,  CAAP-15-0000916  (App.  Aug.  
31,  2018)  (mem.).  
                     
             
          
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
At the conclusion of the bench trial held several 
months later, the district court found Fujiyoshi guilty as 
charged and sentenced him to five days in jail and six months of 
probation with a special condition that prohibited Fujiyoshi 
from visiting Mauna Kea Access Road for the duration of the 
probation.3 The court entered judgment pursuant to its findings 
on November 5, 2015. 
B. Appeal to ICA 
On appeal to the ICA, Fujiyoshi alleged: (1) the 
evidence presented at trial is insufficient to sustain the 
conviction; (2) the dismissal of cases of similarly-situated 
defendants violates Fujiyoshi’s right to due process under the 
Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; and (3) 
the complaint is defective because it fails to allege an element 
of the offense. 
3 The court credited Fujiyoshi with one day served and stayed the 
remaining four days pending the successful completion of six months’ 
probation. 
5             
 
     
  Hawaiʻi  Rules  of  Penal  Procedure   Rule  52(b)  states  that  
“[p]lain  errors  or  defects   affecting  substantial  rights  may  be  
noticed  although   they  were  not  brought  to  the  attention  of  the  
court.”   Therefore,  an  appellate  court  “may  recognize  plain  
error  when  the  error  committed  affects  substantial  rights  of  the  
defendant.”   State  v.  Staley,  91  Hawaiʻi  275,  282,  982  P.2d  904,  
911  (1999)  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted)  (quoting  State  v.  
Cullen,  86  Hawaiʻi  1,  8,  946  P.2d  955,  962  (1997)).   
  The  appellate  court  “will  apply  the  plain  error  
standard  of  review  to  correct  errors  which  seriously  affect  the  
fairness,  integrity,  or  public  reputation  of  judicial  
proceedings,  to  serve  the  ends  of  justice,  and  to  prevent  the  
denial  of  fundamental  rights.”   State  v.  Nichols,  111  Hawaiʻi  
327,  334,
  141  P.3d  974,  981  (2006)  (quoting  State  v.  Sawyer,  88  
Hawaiʻi  325,  330,  966  P.2d  637,  642  (1998)).  
  
  On  certiorari,  Fujiyoshi  argues  that  the  ICA’s  
affirmance  of  the  district  court’s  judgment  was  erroneous  
because:   (1)  the  complaint  was  defective;  (2)  insufficient  
evidence  was  introduced  at  trial  to  support  the  conviction;  and  
(3)  his  request  for  the  ICA  to  take  judicial  notice  of  the  cases  
of  similarly-situated  defendants  was  valid.  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
III. Standard of Review 
IV. Discussion 
6             
 
   We  review  as  plain  error  whether  Fujiyoshi’s   
constitutional  right  to  counsel   was  validly   waived.  4 
          
 
 The  Sixth   Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution,  
made  applicable  to  the  states  through  the  Fourteenth  Amendment,  
and  article  I,  section  14  of  the  Hawaiʻi   Constituti on  guarantee  
every  person  accused  of  a  crime  “the  right  to  be  represented  by  
counsel  at  every  critical  state  of  the  prosecution.”   State  v.  
Phua,  135  Hawaiʻi  504,  512,  353  P.3d  1046,  1054  (2015)  (internal  
quotation  marks  omitted)  (quoting  Reponte  v.  State,  57  Haw.  354,  
361,  556  P.2d  577,  582  (1976));  see  also  State  v.  Dickson,  4  
Haw.  App.  614,  618,  673  P.2d  1036,  1041  (1983).   A  “critical  
stage”  is  “any  stage  where  potential  substantial  prejudice  to  
[a]  defendant’s  rights  inheres,”  such  as  trial.   Phua,  135  
Hawaiʻi  at  512,  353  P.3d  at  1054  (internal  quotation  marks  and  
citation  omitted).   If  a  defendant  proceeds  pro  se  during  a  
critical  stage  of  the  prosecution,  (1)  the  defendant  must  make  a  
knowing  and  intelligent  waiver  of  his  or  her  right  to  counsel  
and  (2)  the  record  must  adequately  reflect  the  defendant’s  
waiver.   Id.  
  In  Phua,  this  court  described  the  analytical  framework  
applied  to  ensure  that  a  waiver  is  knowing  and  intelligent.   Id.  
                     
            
         *** NO T FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
A. Requirements for a Valid Waiver of Right to Counsel 
4 We do not address Fujiyoshi’s arguments, except to note that 
there was sufficient evidence adduced to support the conviction. 
7             
 
         
           
        
        
       
  The  first  prong  of  the  framework  in  Phua  suggests  that  
the  court  “explore  facts  and  circumstances  pertaining  to  the  
defendant  that  will  allow  the  court  to  determine  the  defendant’s  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
at  512-13,  353  P.3d  at  1054-55.   We  explained  that  the  trial  
court  should  focus  its  inquiry  on  three  main  factors:   “(1)  the  
particular  facts  and  circumstances  relating  to  the  defendant  
that  indicate  the  defendant’s  level  of  comprehension;  (2)  the  
defendant’s  awareness  of  the  risks  of  self-representation;  and  
(3)  the  defendant’s  awareness  of  the  disadvantages  of  self-
representation.”   Id.  at  512,  353  P.3d  at  1054  (citing  Dickson,  
4  Haw.  App.  at  619-20,  673  P.2d  at  1041-42).   “The  extent  and  
depth  of  the  court’s  inquiry  and  explanation  of  the  second  and  
third  factors  should  respond  to  the  court’s  perception  of  the  
defendant’s  level  of  understanding.”   Id.  at  514,  353  P.3d  at  
1056.   “While  courts  are  not  required  to  strictly  adhere  to  
[this]  analytical  framework,  it  provides  an  important  tool  to  
ensure  waivers  are  made  knowingly  and  intelligently  in  addition  
to  establishing  a  complete  record  for  appellate  review.”   Id.  at  
513,  353  P.3d  at  1055.  
B. There was No Valid Waiver of Counsel 
In this case, we review Fujiyoshi’s written waiver of 
counsel and the district court’s transcripts to ascertain 
whether there was a valid waiver of counsel. 
1. Background and Comprehension of the Defendant 
8             
 
   Here,  the  district  court’s   inquiry   into  Fujiyoshi’s   
background   was  limited  to  one  question—how  many  years  he  
attended  school.   The  court  did  not  inquire  into  Fujiyoshi’s  
age,  employment  background,  or  experience  with  the  criminal  
justice  system.   These  factors  would  have  assisted  in  
determining  Fujiyoshi’s  level  of  comprehension  and,  accordingly,   
his  ability  to  waive  his  right  to  counsel  intelligently  and  
knowingly.   The  district  court  erroneously  discussed  the  risks  
and  disadvantages  of  self-representation  before  it  perceived  
Fujiyoshi’s  level  of  understanding.   Therefore,  the  district  
court  did  not  meet  the  first  prong  of  the  Phua  analysis.  
       
 
  The  second  prong  of  Phua  recommends  that  the  court  
“warn[]  the  defendant  of  the  risks  particular  to  the  defendant  
in  proceeding  without  counsel[.]”   Id.  at  514,  353  P.3d  at  1056.   
An  adequate  warning  informs  the  defendant  “of  the  nature  of  the  
charge,  the  elements  of  the  offense,  the  pleas  and  defenses  
available,  the  punishments  which  may  be  imposed,  and  all  other  
facts  essential  to  a  broad  understanding  of  the  whole  matter.”   *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
level  of  comprehension.   Such  circumstances  include  age,  
education,  English  language  skills,  mental  capacity,   employment   
background,   and  prior  experience   with  the  criminal  justice  
system.”   Id.  
2. Defendant’s Awareness of the Risks of Self-
Representation 
9             
 
   Here,  the  court  provided  a  cursory  overview  of  self-
representation,  noting  that  it  would  be  “extremely  difficult,”  
that  trials  are  “complicated  and  legally  technical,”  that  
Fujiyoshi  would  be  expected  to  understand  and  follow  the  
applicable  rules,  and  that  he  would  be  precluded  from  arguing  
ineffective  assistance  of  counsel  on  appeal.   The  court  did  not  
inform  Fujiyoshi  about  possible  pleas  or  defenses,  or  potential  
punishments.   It  provided  vague  warnings  that  failed  to  identify   
the  risks  specific  to  Fujiyoshi’s  decision  to  proceed  without  
counsel,  including  the  maximum  penalty  for  the  offense.   
Although  Fujiyoshi  marked  on  his  waiver  form  that  he  had  been  
advised  of  the  nature  and  elements  of  the  charge  against  him,  
the  possible  results  of  a  guilty  verdict,  including  the  maximum  
penalty  for  the  offense,  and  applicable  defenses,  it  is  clear  
from  the  record  that  he  received  no  such  advisement.  
  In  Phua,  the  trial  court  failed  to  inform  the  
defendant  of  the  potential  punishment  that  could  be  imposed.   
Id.  at  517,  353  P.3d  at  1059.   We  held  that  this  error,  alone,  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Id.  at  515,  353  P.3d  at  1057  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted)  
(quoting  Dickson,  4  Haw.  App.  at  620,  673  P.2d  at  1041).   
Furthermore,  “[t]he  judge’s  warnings  must  reflect  more  than  
vague,  general  admonishments,  without  reference  to  specific  
risks  or  disadvantages.”   Id.  at  514,  353  P.3d  at  1056  (internal   
quotation  marks  and  citation  omitted).  
10             
 
        
 
  The  third  prong  of  the  Phua  analysis  suggests  that  the  
court  “meaningfully  inform”  the  defendant  of  the  disadvantages  
of  self-representation  before  a  waiver  of  the  defendant’s  right  
to  counsel  is  obtained.   Id.  at  515,  353  P.3d  at  1057.   This  
information  may  be  conveyed  by  asking:  
          
         
          
     
 
          
         
         
 
 
           
          
            
           
            
           
           *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
was  “sufficient  grounds  for  vacating  the  sentence.”   Id.   Here,  
the  district  court  failed  to  warn  Fujiyoshi  of  the  range  of  
eligible  punishment.   Thus,  the  district  court  failed  to  satisfy   
the  second  prong  of  Phua  and  this  error,  alone,  is  sufficient  to  
vacate  the  conviction.  
3. Defendant’s Awareness of the Disadvantages of 
Self-Representation 
Because of the seriousness of the offense and the serious 
consequences of being found guilty, do you understand that 
you have a Constitutional right to be represented by an 
attorney at a sentencing hearing? 
Do you understand that if you cannot afford an attorney, 
you have the right to have free legal representation 
through the public defender’s office or a court appointed 
lawyer? 
Id.  (footnote  omitted).  
In this case, the district court conducted a gallery 
advisory notifying all present defendants that they each had a 
right to an attorney and an attorney would be appointed free of 
charge if the defendant could not afford one, if a defendant 
elects to proceed without an attorney, he or she is expected to 
follow all applicable rules and the law, and a defendant that 
waives his or her right to counsel is precluded from later 
11             
 
   V. Conclusion 
  Based  on  the  totality  of  the  circumstances,  Fujiyoshi  
did  not  provide  an  intelligent  and  knowing  waiver  of  his  right  
to  counsel.   We  therefore  vacate  the  ICA’s  September  28,  2018  
Judgment  on  Appeal  and  the  district  court’s  November  5,  2015  
Judgment  and  remand  to  the  district  court  for  further  
proceedings  consistent  with  this  summary  disposition  order.

claiming  inadequate  representation.   As  noted,  pursuant  to  the  
first  two  factors  of  the  Phua  analysis,  it  is  apparent  Fujiyoshi   
did  not  make  a  knowing  and  intelligent  waiver  of  his  right  to  
counsel.   Accordingly,  it  is  unnecessary  to  consider  under  the
