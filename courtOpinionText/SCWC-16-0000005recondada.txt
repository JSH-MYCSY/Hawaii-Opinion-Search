ORDER DENYING “MOTION TO RECONSIDER”
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
On July 28, 2016, petitioner/claimant-appellant Dwight
 
J. Vicente filed a “Motion to Reconsider,” in which he asks the
 
court to reconsider the July 18, 2016 order rejecting his
 
application for writ of certiorari. A rejection of an
 
application for writ of certiorari, however, is not subject to
 
reconsideration. See HRAP Rule 40.1(h) (“Neither acceptance nor
 
rejection of an application for a writ of certiorari shall be
 subject to a motion for reconsideration in the supreme court. 
The rejection of an application for certiorari shall be final.”). 
Accordingly, 
It is hereby ordered that the “Motion to Reconsider” is 
denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, August 3, 2016.
