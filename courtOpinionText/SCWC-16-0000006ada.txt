OPINION OF THE COURT BY NAKAYAMA, J.
 
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellee Eric N. Yokota (Yokota) 
was charged with five counts of forgery and one count of theft 
for fraudulently cashing five checks from the same bank account over the course of six days in December 2014. The question he presents on certiorari is whether Respondent/Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawai' i (the State) could simultaneously charge him with           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
one count of theft as a continuing course of conduct and five
 
individual counts of forgery.
 
Notwithstanding the five counts of forgery, because the
 
language of our theft statute permits theft to be charged as a
 continuing course of conduct, we conclude that the Circuit Court
 of the First Circuit (circuit court) erred in dismissing the
 theft charge as a matter of law. As the Intermediate Court of
 Appeals (ICA) concluded the same, we affirm the ICA’s July 26,
 2017 judgment on appeal.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On June 23, 2015, Yokota was charged with several
 
criminal counts stemming from five incidents, occurring over the
 course of six days, where he allegedly forged and cashed
 fraudulent checks. Specifically, the State alleged that:
 
On December 11, 2014, Yokota entered the Pearlridge
 
branch of American Savings Bank (ASB) and presented a teller with
 an ASB check drawn on the account of Rudolph Kama (Kama). The
 check was made payable to “Cash” in the amount of $100, which the
 teller cashed for Yokota.
 
On December 12, 2014, Yokota entered the Stadium Mall
 
branch of ASB and presented a teller with an ASB check drawn on
 Kama’s account. The check was made payable to “Cash” in the
 amount of $175, which the teller cashed for Yokota. 
On December 13, 2014, Yokota entered the Pearl City
 
2
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
branch of ASB and presented a teller with an ASB check drawn on
 
Kama’s account. The check was made payable to “Eric Yokota” in
 the amount of $200, which the teller cashed for Yokota. 
On December 15, 2014, Yokota again entered the Pearl
 
City branch of ASB and presented a teller with an ASB check drawn
 on Kama’s account. The check was made payable to “Cash” in the
 amount of $145, which the teller cashed for Yokota. 
Finally, on December 16, 2014, Yokota entered the Salt
 
Lake branch of ASB and presented a teller with an ASB check drawn
 on Kama’s account. The check was made payable to “Cash” in the
 amount of $100, which the teller cashed for Yokota. 
Each check that Yokota had allegedly cashed was less
 
than $300 in value, but in the aggregate, totaled $720. 
On January 6, 2015, Kama filed a police report alleging
 
that seven checks were drawn on his personal account without his
 knowledge or authorization. Kama related that five of the seven
 forged checks were endorsed by Yokota. Kama further stated that
 he believed Yokota to be a friend of his deceased son’s
 girlfriend.
 
Accordingly, Yokota was arrested on June 22, 2015 and
 
charged with eight criminal counts by an amended felony
 information filed on June 30, 2015. The eight counts were
 charged as follows:

      *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
A. Circuit Court Proceedings: Motion to Dismiss
 
On August 4, 2015, Yokota filed a motion to dismiss
 
Counts VI (theft in the second degree) and VIII (identity theft
 
in the second degree) in the circuit court.5 Yokota argued that
 
under the circumstances in his case, the State could not charge
 him with theft in the second degree because he did not steal
 “property or services the value of which exceeds $300” pursuant
 to HRS § 708-831(1)(b).
 
First, Yokota noted that no single check, by itself,
 
exceeded the statutory minimum required to charge him for theft
 in the second degree.
 
Second, Yokota argued that the State could not
 
aggregate the five separate incidents of theft into one under a
 continuing course of conduct theory in order to satisfy the $300
 threshold amount. Yokota contended that under State v. Castro,
 69 Haw. 633, 653, 756 P.2d 1033, 1047 (1988), “[t]he test to
 determine whether [a] defendant intended to commit more than one
 offense in the course of a criminal episode is whether the
 evidence discloses one general intent or discloses separate and
 distinct intents.” “If there is but one intention, one general
 impulse and one plan, there is but one offense.” Id. Here,
 
Yokota argued, on each day that he forged and cashed a check, he

       6 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
allegedly had one impulse (to steal money) and one plan (to
pass a stolen check at a bank). The allegations that he had
similar impulses on subsequent days are irrelevant and do
not prove general intent to steal over $300 such that the
State is justified in charging more serious offenses.
 
Yokota further contended that this court’s reasoning in 
State v. Decoite, 132 Hawai' i 436, 323 P.3d 80 (2014), was 
directly applicable to his case. He noted that in Decoite, this 
court held that two instances of domestic physical abuse that occurred over a two-year period could not be charged as a continuing course of conduct offense because “physical abuse” was “necessarily discrete and episodic.” 132 Hawai' i at 438, 323 
P.3d at 82. Similar to an incident of domestic violence, Yokota argued that each incident of theft was necessarily discrete in nature, as “[he] enter[ed] the bank, passe[d] the stolen check, [got] the money and the deed [was] done.” 
The State opposed Yokota’s motion to dismiss and argued
 
that the five alleged instances of theft were clearly committed
 under one scheme or course of conduct, and therefore, aggregation
 of the value of goods stolen was permitted by statute.
6
 
Once it is established that a course of conduct exists, HRS § 708-801(6)
 
(2014) explicitly allows theft amounts to be aggregated:
 
Valuation of property or services. Whenever the value of
 
property or services is determinative of the class or grade
of an offense, or otherwise relevant to a prosecution, the
following shall apply:
 
. . . .
 
(6) Amounts involved in thefts committed pursuant to
one scheme or course of conduct, whether the property taken
be of one person or several persons, may be aggregated in
determining the class or grade of the offense.
 
7
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Applying Castro, the State concluded that Yokota evinced “one
 
general intent,” which was “to steal money from [Kama].”
 
For support, the State explained that Yokota’s conduct
 
was more akin to the defendant’s conduct in State v. Martin, 62
 Haw. 364, 616 P.2d 193 (1980), than Decoite. The State noted
 that in Martin, this court determined that the defendant engaged
 in a continuing course of criminal conduct when she filed
 multiple fraudulent public assistance claims over the course of
 several years, because the defendant was motivated by a single
 criminal impulse –- to steal from the State.
 
The State argued that here, while Yokota did not submit
 
fraudulent statements, “he did submit fraudulently executed
 checks over the course of time.” Just as the defendant in Martin
 had a continuing intent to defraud the State, the State contended
 that Yokota “had the continuing intent to defraud Mr. Kama and he
 did so by continually submitting identical fraudulent checks.” 
Thus, just as this court concluded in Martin, the State concluded
 that Yokota’s acts constituted a continuing course of criminal
 conduct. As such, the State requested that the circuit court
 deny Yokota’s motion to dismiss.
 
After holding a hearing on Yokota’s motion to dismiss,
 
the circuit court orally granted Yokota’s motion and dismissed
 Counts VI and VIII with prejudice. Specifically, the circuit
 court stated, “the Court is in agreement with the defense’s
 
8
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
position, that the State is not permitted to aggregate the amount
 
in determining the grade of the offense, that each of these are
 separate. So the Court will grant the motion and dismiss Counts
 6 and 8.” Yokota then pleaded no contest to the remaining counts
 against him, and the circuit court found him guilty of the five
 counts of forgery (Counts I to V) and the one count of
 unauthorized possession of confidential personal information
 (Count VII). 
On December 8, 2015, the circuit court entered a
 
written order granting Yokota’s motion to dismiss Counts VI and
 VIII of the amended felony information with prejudice.
 
B. ICA Proceedings
 
On January 6, 2016, the State filed a notice of appeal. 
In its opening brief, the State alleged that “[t]he circuit court
 
erred by concluding the State was barred as a matter of law from
 charging Yokota’s theft by passing 5 fraudulently executed checks
 over the course of 6 days as one scheme or course of conduct.” 
Specifically, the State argued that the plain language of HRS §
 708-801(6) allowed the State “to aggregate amounts obtained
 during individual instances of obtaining money from another by
 deception, even if the victim [was] not the same person in each
 individual instance.” The State further contended that “the
 question of whether the individual forgeries were continuous
 conduct should be submitted to the trier of fact, and it was
 
9
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
err[or] for the circuit court to conclude that prosecution as
 
continuous conduct was precluded as a matter of law.” 
In response, Yokota argued that the circuit court
 
correctly concluded that the individual forgeries could not be
 charged as theft under a continuing course of conduct theory. 
He stated that “[t]he State recognized the transitory, brief, and
 episodic nature of each act of uttering a forged instrument when
 it charged [him] with five separate counts of [forgery].” 
Therefore, Yokota concluded, because his conduct was
 “‘necessarily discrete and episodic,’ the circuit court did not
 err when it concluded that the thefts that resulted from each
 count of forgery could not be aggregated.”
 
In a summary disposition order filed on June 23, 2017,
 
the ICA agreed with the State and concluded that “the Circuit
 Court erred in dismissing Counts VI and VIII on the basis that
 they could not be charged as continuing courses of conduct.” 
Based on the test this court articulated in Decoite and Martin,
 the ICA concluded that the “statutory and case law illustrate[d]
 a legislative intent to allow the treatment of theft crimes as
 continuing courses of conduct.” 
Accordingly, the ICA vacated the circuit court’s order
 
granting Yokota’s motion to dismiss Counts VI and VIII and
 remanded the case to the circuit court for further proceedings
 consistent with the summary disposition order. On July 26, 2017,
 
10
           
        
        
       
        
        
           
           
         
        
    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the ICA filed its judgment on appeal. 
Yokota filed an application for writ of certiorari. 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
A. Conclusions of Law
 
Conclusions of law are reviewed de novo under the
 
right/wrong standard. Decoite, 132 Hawai' i at 437, 323 P.3d at 
81.
 
B. Statutory Interpretation
 
The interpretation of a statute is a question of law
 
reviewable de novo. State v. Arceo, 84 Hawai' i 1, 10, 928 P.2d 
843, 852 (1996).
 
When interpreting our statutory scheme, we abide by
 
several established rules of statutory construction:
 
First, our foremost obligation is to ascertain and give
effect to the intention of the legislature, which is
obtained primarily from the language contained in the
statute[s] themselves. Second, [l]aws in pari materia, or
upon the same subject matter, shall be construed with
reference to each other. What is clear in one statute may
be called in aid to explain what is doubtful in another.
And, third, [t]he legislature is presumed not to intend an
absurd result, and legislation will be construed to avoid,
if possible, inconsistency, contradiction[,] and
illogicality.
 
Id. at 19, 928 P.2d at 861 (alterations in original) (citations
 
and quotations omitted).
 
III. DISCUSSION
 
Yokota presents one question for this court’s review:
 
“[w]hether the ICA gravely erred in concluding that the State was
 
11
           
  
            
           
            
             
             
            
             
            *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
not barred from charging Yokota with [theft in the second degree]
 
for passing five fraudulently executed checks amounting to $720
 over the course of six days as a continuing course of conduct.”
7
 
Specifically, Yokota alleges that when the State decided to
 charge him with five separate counts of forgery, it “recognized
 the transitory, brief, and episodic nature of each act,” and
 could not simultaneously charge him with theft under a continuing
 course of conduct theory. For the reasons stated below, we
 reject Yokota’s argument and hold that theft can be charged as a
 continuing course of conduct, notwithstanding a decision to
 charge individual counts of forgery.
 
A.	 Generally, theft may be charged as a continuing course of
conduct.
 
HRS § 701-108(4) (2014) provides that “[a]n offense is
 
committed when every element occurs, or, if a legislative purpose
 
to prohibit a continuing course of conduct plainly appears, at
 the time when the course of conduct or the defendant’s complicity
 therein is terminated.” In Decoite, we stated that “[t]he test
 to determine whether a crime may be charged on a continuous
 conduct theory is whether the language, structure, and purpose of
 
While Yokota does not argue on certiorari that the ICA erred in also
 
reinstating Count VIII (identity theft in the second degree), our decision on
whether the State could charge Yokota with theft in the second degree directly
affects the validity of the identity theft in the second degree charge. A
 person can only be charged with identity theft in the second degree if that
person makes or causes to be made a transmission of any personal information
of another, “with the intent to commit the offense of theft in the second
 
degree from any person or entity.” HRS § 708-839.7 (2014) (emphasis added).
 
12
 7           
          
           
            *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the statute reveals a legislative intent to criminalize 
continuing conduct.” 132 Hawai' i at 438, 323 P.3d at 82. 
The language of the theft statute indicates that theft
 
may be charged on a continuing conduct theory. The theft statute
 provides that a person commits theft if the person “obtains, or
 exerts control over, the property of another by deception with
 intent to deprive the other of the property.” HRS § 708-830(2)
 (2014). Similarly, a person commits theft in the second degree
 “if the person commits theft . . . [o]f property or services the
 value of which exceeds $300.” HRS § 708-831(1)(b).
8
 
Here, the Legislature’s decision to define theft as
 
obtaining or exerting control over “property or services,” see
 HRS §§ 708-830.5(1)(a), 708-831(1)(b), 708-832(1)(a), 708-833(1),
 and not “a piece of property or a service,” indicates that the
 Legislature did not necessarily intend that theft be charged
 individually. Furthermore, HRS § 708-801(6) provides that
 “[a]mounts involved in thefts committed pursuant to one scheme or
 course of conduct, whether the property taken be of one person or
 several persons, may be aggregated in determining the class or
 grade of the offense.” This indicates that the Legislature
 explicitly considered that theft could be charged on a continuing
 
For purposes of HRS § 708-831(1)(b), “property” is defined as “any
 
money, personal property, real property, thing in action, evidence of debt or
contract, or article of value of any kind.” HRS § 708-800 (2014).
 
13
 8           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
course of conduct theory.
 The plain language of the statute is further
 
supported by case law affirming convictions of guilt for theft as
 
a continuing course of conduct. For example, in Martin, the
 defendant, over the course of four years, filed multiple
 fraudulent public assistance forms. 62 Haw. at 366, 616 P.2d at
 195-96. This court held that because “all statements were
 identical, representing that defendant was unmarried, unemployed,
 and not receiving social security benefits,” there was “but one
 intention and plan here” -- to commit theft on the State -- “and
 thus . . . one offense.” Id. at 369, 616 P.2d at 197. 
Accordingly, we affirmed the defendant’s conviction of theft
 under a continuous offense theory. Id. at 366, 616 P.2d at 195.
 
Similarly, in State v. Stenger, 122 Hawai' i 271, 279, 
226 P.3d 441, 449 (2010), this court affirmed a jury verdict finding the defendant guilty of theft when the defendant failed to disclose for several months that she no longer qualified for public assistance. We concluded in Stenger that the defendant’s theft by deception constituted a continuous offense, because “based on [the State’s] presentation of the case, [the defendant] acted under ‘one general impulse,’ and had ‘but one intention and plan,’ to unlawfully procure public assistance from the government through a ‘series of acts.’” Id. at 289, 226 P.3d at 
14
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
459 (citations omitted).
 
The plain language of the theft statute and our prior 
case law lead us to conclude that the State may charge theft on a 
continuing conduct theory. The circuit court erred in concluding that the State could not do so as a matter of law. Additionally, we reiterate that whether a continuing course of conduct offense occurred is a question that should be submitted to the jury. See 
State v. Matias, 102 Hawai' i 300, 305, 75 P.3d 1191, 1196 (2003) 
(“The test to determine whether the defendant intended to commit more than one offense is whether the evidence discloses one general intent or discloses separate and distinct intents. . . . All factual issues involved in this determination must be decided by the trier of fact.” (emphasis in original)); see also People v. Daghita, 92 N.Y.S.2d 799, 802 (N.Y. App. Div. 1949) (“What is
 ‘separate’, what is ‘single’, . . . are all jury questions both
 by legal tradition and by necessity. . . . The question of
 whether the takings were separate or united in purpose was
 carefully and fairly submitted to the jury as a question of
 fact[.]”).
 
Accordingly, the ICA correctly concluded that the
 
circuit court erred in determining that the State was barred, as
 a matter of law, from charging theft as a continuing course of
 conduct.
 
15
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
B.	 The State could charge Yokota with theft on a continuing
course of conduct theory while simultaneously charging him
with individual counts of forgery.
 
Yokota does not appear to dispute the foregoing general
 
principles. Instead, he challenges the State’s decision to
 
charge him with theft as a continuing course of conduct when it
 simultaneously charged him with five separate counts of forgery. 
Yokota argues that when the State decided to charge him with five
 counts of forgery, it necessarily determined that his conduct was
 transitory, brief, and episodic. Yokota concludes that because
 conduct that is “necessarily discrete and episodic” cannot be
 continuous, the State could not charge him with theft under a
 continuing course of conduct theory. The ICA did not address
 this aspect of Yokota’s argument on appeal. However, we conclude
 that Yokota’s argument fails for two reasons.
 
First, we have consistently stated that the State has 
wide discretion in bringing criminal charges. Decoite, 132 
Hawai'i at 442, 323 P.3d at 86 (Pollack, J., dissenting) (citing 
United States v. Batchelder, 442 U.S. 114, 124 (1979)); see also State v. Lagat, 97 Hawai' i 492, 499, 40 P.3d 894, 901 (2002) 
(“[T]he matter [on whether to bring a charge under one statute or another] is necessarily and traditionally in the discretion of the prosecuting attorney.”). Yokota does not provide any reason why the State abused its discretion here.

Second, while the Legislature placed limitations on the
 
possibility of multiple convictions arising from the same
 
conduct, it did not similarly limit the State’s ability to charge
 multiple offenses arising from the same conduct. HRS § 701­109(1) (2014) provides:
 
(1) When the same conduct of a defendant may establish
an element of one or more offense, the defendant may be
prosecuted for each offense of which such conduct is an
element . The defendant may not, however, be convicted of
more  than  one  offense  if:
 
. . . .
 
(e)	 The offense is defined as a continuing course of
conduct and the defendant’s course of conduct
 was uninterrupted, unless the law provides that
specific periods of conduct constitute separate
offenses.
 
(emphasis added). In other words, the Legislature explicitly 
provided that a defendant may be charged with multiple offenses arising from the same conduct even when he or she cannot be convicted of more than one offense. HRS § 701-109(1). Therefore, while two offenses might eventually merge to “limit the possibility of multiple convictions . . . when the defendant has basically engaged in only one course of criminal conduct directed at one criminal goal,” see HRS § 701-109 cmt. (2014), the State may still prosecute each offense individually. Accord 
State v. Padilla, 114 Hawai' i 507, 517, 164 P.3d 765, 775 (App. 
2007). Accordingly, here, the State could charge individual counts of forgery and a single count of theft, even if HRS § 701­109(1)(e) might prohibit Yokota from being convicted of both

Yokota does not offer any reason why the State exceeded 
the bounds of its discretion by charging him with theft as a 
continuing course of conduct and individual counts of forgery. Because the plain language of the theft statute allows theft to be charged as a continuing course of conduct, the circuit court erred in dismissing Yokota’s theft in the second degree charge as a matter of law. Instead, we agree with the State that “the question of whether the individual forgeries were continuous conduct should be submitted to the trier of fact.” See Matias, 
102 Hawai' i at 305, 75 P.3d at 1196. 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
The State may charge defendants with theft on a
 
continuing course of conduct theory. This is permissible even
 when the State also decides to simultaneously charge individual
 counts of forgery. Therefore, the ICA did not err in vacating
 the circuit court’s “Order Granting Motion to Dismiss Counts VI
 
We also note that the State was not barred from charging forgery as a
 
continuing course of conduct as a matter of law. As previously noted, HRS §
701-109(1)(e) provides that a defendant may not be convicted of more than one
offense if “[t]he offense is defined as a continuing course of conduct and the
defendant’s course of conduct was uninterrupted, unless the law provides that
specific periods of conduct constitute separate offenses .” (Emphasis added.)
Here, HRS § 708-852, forgery in the second degree, does not explicitly
state that specific acts of forgery shall constitute separate offenses. This indicates that the State is not barred, as a matter of law, from chargingforgery as a continuing offense. Cf. Arceo , 84 Hawai 'i at 19-20, 928 P.2d at
861-62 (precluding sexual assault from being charged as a continuing offensebecause the definition of “sexual penetration” explicitly provided that “each act of sexual penetration shall constitute a separate offense”).

While not addressed by the parties on certiorari, after the theft
 
charges were dismissed, Yokota subsequently pleaded no contest to the five
counts of forgery and the one count of unauthorized possession of confidential
personal information. The circuit court found him guilty of those six
 charges.
Because we affirm the ICA’s decision to vacate the circuit court’s 
dismissal of the theft charges, on remand, the circuit court should carefullyconsider any motion to withdraw pleas. See State v. Gomes , 79 Hawai 'i 32, 36­
37, 897 P.2d 959, 963-64 (1995). The circuit court should also consider the applicability of merger pursuant to HRS § 701-109(1)(e). See Matias , 102 
Hawai'i at 305-06, 75 P.3d at 1196-97.
