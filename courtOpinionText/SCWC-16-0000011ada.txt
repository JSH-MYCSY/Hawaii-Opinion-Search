RECKTENWALD, C.J., NAKAYAMA, McKENNA, POLLACK, and WILSON, JJ.
 
PER CURIAM
 
Petitioner/third-party plaintiff-appellant Violet Jhun
 
(“Jhun”) applies for certiorari review of the Intermediate Court
 
of Appeals’ (“ICA”) March 15, 2016 order dismissing her appeal
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
from an unfavorable summary judgment order (“Dismissal Order”). 
The ICA dismissed Jhun’s appeal for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction based on the absence of an appealable final judgment
 and also dismissed as moot her motion requesting the ICA compel
 the circuit court to enter a final judgment. Jhun acknowledges
 that a final judgment has not been entered in the case and took
 steps to obtain such a judgment, but was unsuccessful. Entry of
 a final appealable judgment would have perfected Jhun’s appeal. 
Based on the record presented on appeal, it appears
 
that all claims against all parties have been resolved and entry
 of a final appealable judgment was warranted. Accordingly, we
 vacate the ICA’s March 15, 2016 Dismissal Order and remand the
 matter to the ICA with instructions to temporarily remand the
 case to the circuit court to enter an appealable final judgment,
 to direct the circuit court to supplement the record on appeal
 with the final judgment, and to then proceed to consider the
 appeal accordingly. 
I. Background
 
A. Brief Factual History 
Raevyn Waikiki (“Waikiki”) and Jhun were neighbors in 
the Ho'omaka Village apartment complex in Waipahu, Hawai' i. One 
evening in 2011, as Waikiki was returning to her apartment from walking her dog, she was injured by Jhun’s dog.

   Third-Party Defendant WADE KIOSHI KAL EOLANI
 
SHIMOJO’s (“Shimojo”) Motion for Summar y Judgment
 
filed herein on March 6 , 2015 (“motion”) came on for
 
hearing before the Honorable Karl K. Sakamoto, Judge
of the above-entitled Court, on Friday, May 8, 2015 at
10:00 a.m., with Janice D. Heidt appearing for
Plaintiff RAEVYN WAIKIKI (“Plaintiff”), Charlene
 
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
B. Procedural History
 
1. The Lawsuit
 
On September 4, 2013, Waikiki filed a lawsuit against 
Jhun and the Ho' omaka Village Association of Apartment Owners 
(“AOAO”) for monetary damages.1 The AOAO answered the complaint 
and filed a cross-claim against Jhun. Jhun answered the complaint and filed a counterclaim against Waikiki, claiming that Waikiki’s dog bit and injured her. Jhun also filed a third-party complaint against Wade Shimojo (“Shimojo”), who lived with Waikiki, alleging that Shimojo and Waikiki’s dog provoked Jhun’s dogs earlier in the day prior to the attack. Additionally, Jhun answered the cross-claim filed by the AOAO. 
Jhun’s counterclaim against Waikiki was dismissed early
 
in the case. 
In 2015, Shimojo moved for summary judgment against
 
Jhun with respect to the third-party complaint.
2 The circuit
 
court granted the motion and entered a written order on June 18,
 2015. The order provided as follows:
 
1
 The Honorable Karl K. Sakamoto presided over the case.
 
2
 Based on a review of the record on appeal, it does not appear that
 
Shimojo filed an answer to the third-party complaint.
 
3
   
The order did not include any language regarding certification
 
under Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (“HRCP”) Rule 54(b) or any 
language resolving all of the claims in the action. 
     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
S.P.T. Murata appearing for Defendant HO 'OMAKA 
VILLAGE, ASSOCIATION OF APARTMENT OWNERS (“AOAO”),
Walter R. Schoettle appearing for Defendant and Third-Party Plaintiff VIOLET JHUN (“Jhun”) and Daniel T. Kimappearing for Shimojo, due notice having been given. The Court, having reviewed and considered the motionand the reply memorandum filed by Shimojo on April 17,2015, the memorandum in opposition filed by Jhun onApril 14, 2015, the statement of no position filed byAOAO on April 15, 2015, the joinder filed by Plaintiffon April 20, 2015, the oral arguments of counsel, therecord and file of the matter and being fully advisedin the premises, and good cause appearing therefor,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED ADJUDGED AND DECREED that
 
Third-Party Defendant WADE KIOSHI KALEOLANI SHIMOJO’s
Motion for Summary Judgment filed on March 6, 2015 is
GRANTED.
 
This 
Order may be approved as to form by the
parties in counterparts, each of which when executed
shall, irrespective of the date of its execution and
delivery be deemed an original, and said counterparts
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
 
Sometime thereafter, Waikiki, Jhun, and the AOAO
 
proceeded to resolve their claims through the Court Annexed
 
Arbitration Program. The arbitrator ultimately determined that
 Waikiki was 5% at fault, Jhun was 95% at fault, and the AOAO was
 0% at fault, and noted that Shimojo was “out on summary
 judgment.” After applying her contributory percentage to the
 total damages awarded by the arbitrator, Waikiki was awarded
 $83,094.87. Jhun appealed the arbitrator’s decision to the
 circuit court.
 
4
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
On December 9, 2015, several months after Jhun appealed
 
the arbitrator’s decision, Waikiki, Jhun, and the AOAO filed a
 
stipulation, pursuant to HRCP Rule 41(a)(1)(B),3
 dismissing their
claims in the lawsuit:
 
IT IS STIPULATED AND AGREED by and between
Plaintiff/Third-Party Defendant RAEVYN WAIKIKI
(hereinafter “Plaintiff”)and Defendant HO 'OMAKA 
VILLAGE, ASSOCIATION OF APARTMENT OWNERS and
Defendant/Third-Party Plaintiff VIOLET JHUN
(hereinafter “Defendants”), through their respective
counsel, that pursuant to Rule 41(a)[(]1)(B) of the
Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure, all claims asserted
in the Complaint filed on September 4, 2013 against
the Defendants; all Counter-Claims filed November 15,
2013 by Violet Jhun against Raevyn Waikiki; and all
Cross-Claims filed September 12, 2013 by Ho 'omaka 
Village, Association of Apartment Owners against
Violet Jhun are hereby dismissed with prejudice.
All other claims and parties are dismissed.
Each party to this Stipulation shall bear their own
attorneys’ fees and costs.
 
The stipulation was signed by Waikiki’s counsel, Jhun’s counsel,
 
and the AOAO’s counsel. Neither Shimojo nor his counsel signed
 
3
 
Rule 41.  Dismissal of actions.
 (a) Voluntary dismissal; Effect thereof.
(1) BY PLAINTIFF; BY STIPULATION . An action may
be dismissed by the plaintiff without order of court
(A) by filing a notice of dismissal at any time before
the return date as provided in Rule 12(a) or service
by the adverse party of an answer or of a motion for
summary judgment, or (B) by filing a stipulation of
dismissal signed by all parties who have appeared in
the action, in the manner and form prescribed by Rule
41.1 of these rules.  Unless otherwise stated in the
 
notice of dismissal or stipulation, the dismissal is
without prejudice, except that a notice of dismissal
operates as an adjudication upon the merits when filed
by a plaintiff who has once dismissed in any court of
the United States, or of any state, territory or
insular possession of the United States an action
based on or including the same claim.
 
5
  the stipulation. 
2. The Appeal
 
On January 8, 2016, Jhun filed a notice of appeal in
 
the ICA appealing from the June 18, 2015 summary judgment order
 
on the third-party complaint entered in favor of Shimojo. Jhun
 
4 5
cited Hawai' i Revised Statutes (“HRS”) §§ 641-1(a)  and 667-51  as 
the basis for her appeal and contended that the summary judgment order was made final by the December 9, 2015 stipulation that dismissed all the remaining claims and parties. 
On February 5, 2016, Shimojo filed a statement
 
contesting jurisdiction. He argued that the December 9, 2015
 stipulation for dismissal terminated Jhun’s right to relitigate
 her third-party claims against him and divested the ICA of
 jurisdiction over the appeal. Shimojo acknowledged that Jhun
 could have filed an appeal from a final judgment but explained
 that “a final judgment was never filed, the parties in the
 ongoing lawsuit settled and filed a Stipulation for Dismissal
 with prejudice of all claims and all parties which then precluded
 her from adjudicating the third-party claim again on appeal.”
 Shimojo maintained that once the stipulation was signed, the
 circuit court lost jurisdiction over the claims in the lawsuit.
4
   HRS § 641-1(a) provides that “[a]ppeals shall be allowed in civil
 
matters from all final judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit and district
courts and the land court to the intermediate appellate court, subject to
chapter 602.”
5
   HRS § 667-51 governs appeals in foreclosure cases.  Inasmuch as this
 
case is not a foreclosure case, HRS § 667-51 does not provide Jhun a statutory
basis for her appeal.   
6
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
On February 10, 2016, Jhun filed her jurisdictional
 
statement. She conceded that the June 18, 2015 summary judgment
 
order was not final and appealable when it was entered but argued
 that the execution of the December 9, 2015 stipulation for
 dismissal was sufficient to render the summary judgment order
 final and appealable. She noted, however, that at the time the
 parties executed the stipulation, Shimojo’s counsel did not sign
 the stipulation and, therefore, it was unclear whether the
 summary judgment order had become final and appealable in the
 absence of a final judgment. Jhun explained that, to the extent
 the ICA may determine the appeal to be premature, she had
 recently mailed a separate final judgment disposing of all of the
 claims to all parties for approval and, thus, asked the ICA to
 defer ruling on the jurisdictional issue until the circuit court
 entered a proper final judgment and she filed an amended notice
 of appeal. 
On February 18, 2016, Jhun submitted a proposed final
 
judgment to the circuit court for approval. The proposed final
 judgment was not signed by any of the parties and was accompanied
 with a letter informing the court of the pending appeal and the
 jurisdictional issue raised by Shimojo. The proposed judgment
 provided as follows:
 
7
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
FINAL JUDGMENT
 
The “O RDER GRANTING THIRD PARTY DEFENDANT WADE KI[]OSHI
 
KALEOLANI SHIMOJO’S MOTION FOR  SUMMARY JUDGMENT,  FILED MARCH 6,
2015,” having been filed herein on June 18, 2015; and
all other claims by all other parties having been
dismissed by stipulation of the parties thereto, filed
herein on December 9, 2015; now, therefor:
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED ADJUDGED AND DECREED that
 
Final Judgment on the said Third-Party Complaint be,
and hereby is, entered in favor of Third-Party
Defendant, WADE KIOSHI KALEOLANI SHIMOJO, and against
Third-Party Plaintiff, VIOLET JHUN.  All other claims
 by all other parties are dismissed with prejudice,
pursuant to the stipulation of the parties thereto,
filed on December 9, 2015.  This is a Final Judgment
disposing of all of the claims of all of the parties.
 
By letter dated February 24, 2016, Waikiki and Shimojo objected
 
to the submission of the proposed final judgment on the ground
 that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction over the case pursuant
 to the December 9, 2015 stipulation. They explained that the
 December 9, 2015 stipulation dismissing all claims and all
 parties with prejudice amounted to an adjudication on the merits
 of all issues that were raised or could have been raised in the
 lawsuit; therefore, any subsequent litigation was barred by 
res
 
judicata. In response, Jhun argued that while a HRCP Rule
 41(a)(1)(B) stipulation for dismissal of all claims is generally
 equivalent to a final judgment, the December 9, 2015 stipulation
 did not include the third-party claim that was previously decided
 on summary judgment pursuant to the June 18, 2015 summary
 judgment order. On March 3, 2016, the circuit court appears to
 
8
  
 
 have declined to enter the proposed final judgment.6
  
Subsequently, on March 10, 2016, pursuant to HRS § 602­
57(3),7
 Jhun filed a “Motion for Order or Writ in Aid of
Jurisdiction” in the ICA. Jhun asked the ICA to issue an order
 
or writ compelling the circuit court to execute a final judgment
 in the case if the ICA deemed such a judgment was necessary to
 establish appellate jurisdiction from the June 18, 2015 summary
 judgment order. Jhun argued that appellate jurisdiction depended
 upon the finality of the June 18, 2015 summary judgment order on
 the third party complaint and, therefore, a final judgment must
 be entered in the case. Jhun contended that, absent action from
 the ICA, because the circuit court denied the proposed final
 judgment, it would be necessary to petition the supreme court for
 a writ of mandamus to compel the circuit court to enter a final
 judgment and then file another notice of appeal. 
By order entered on March 15, 2016, the ICA dismissed
 
the appeal for lack of jurisdiction and dismissed the pending
 motion. 
The ICA concluded that, because the circuit court had
 
not yet entered a separate final judgment disposing of all the
 claims in the lawsuit, it lacked jurisdiction over the appeal:
6
   A copy of the document list for the underlying case from the Hawai 'i 
State Judiciary’s Ho 'ohiki electronic database describes the entry for docket
number 89 as follows:  “(DENIED, 1ST DIVISION) FINAL JUDGMENT[.]”  It is 
unclear from the record the basis upon which the circuit court declined toenter the proposed final judgment. 
7
   HRS § 602-57(3) provides that the ICA has jurisdiction “[t]o make or
 
issue any order or writ necessary or appropriate in the aid of its
jurisdiction[.]” 
9
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
When a party attempts to assert an appeal from a
civil circuit court case, HRS § 641-1(a) and HRCP Rule
58 require that such an “appeal may be taken fromcircuit court orders resolving claims against partiesonly after the orders have been reduced to a judgmentand the judgment has been entered in favor of andagainst the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP[Rule] 58[.]”  Jenkins[ v. Cades Schutte Fleming &
Wright], 76 Hawai 'i [115,] 119, 869 P.2d [1334,] 1338
[(1994)] (emphasis added).  “Thus, based on Jenkins,and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even ifit resolves all claims against the parties, until ithas been reduced to a separate judgment.”  Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai 'i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177,
1186 (2008); Bailey v. Duvauchelle, 135 Hawai 'i 482, 
489, 353 P.3d 1024, 1031 (2015).  Furthermore, “anappeal from any judgment will be dismissed aspremature if the judgment does not, on its face,either resolve all claims against all parties orcontain the finding necessary for certification underHRCP [Rule] 54(b).”  76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 
1338.  The Supreme Court of Hawai 'i noted that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves
on its face all of the issues in the case, the
burden of searching the often voluminous circuit
court record to verify assertions of
jurisdiction is cast upon this case.  Neither
 the parties nor counsel have a right to cast
upon this court the burden of searching a
voluminous record for evidence of finality, . .
. and we should not make such searches necessary
by allowing the parties the option of waiving
the requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58.
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (original 
emphasis).  “An appeal from an order that is notreduced to a judgment in favor or against the party bythe time the record is filed in the supreme court willbe dismissed.” Id. at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote 
omitted). 
On January 28, 2016, the circuit court clerk
filed the record on appeal for appellate court case
number CAAP-16-0000011, which does not contain an
appealable final judgment.  Therefore, we lack
 appellate jurisdiction.
Although the June 18, 2015 interlocutory order
completely resolves an entire substantive claim, the
 
10
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Supreme Court of Hawai 'i has explained that, “based on
Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable,
even if it resolves all claims against the parties,until it has been reduced to a separate judgment.”Carlisle, 119 Hawai 'i at 254, 195 P.3d at 1186; 
Bailey, 135 Hawai 'i at 489, 353 P.3d at 1031. 
(Underlining and some brackets in the original; some brackets
 
added.)  The ICA also noted that the December 9, 2015 stipulation
 failed to satisfy the requirements of HRCP Rule 41(a)(1)(B) for a
 voluntary dismissal because it was not signed by Shimojo, who was
 a party to the lawsuit and who appeared in the action:
 
In addition, with respect to the December 9,
2015 stipulation to dismiss all claims, we note that
the parties have failed to comply with the
requirements of HRCP Rule 41(a)(1)(B) for a
stipulation to dismiss.  HRCP Rule 41(a)(1)(B)
provides that a stipulation to dismiss must be “signed
by all parties who have appeared in the action”:
 
Rule 
41.  Dismissal of actions.
 
(a) Voluntary dismissal: Effect thereof.
(1) By plaintiff; by stipulation. 
An action may be dismissed by the plaintiff 
without order of the court (A) by filing a
notice of dismissal at any time before the
return date as provided in Rule 12(a) or service
by the adverse party of an answer or of a motion
for summary judgment, or (B) by filing a
stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties
who have appeared in the action, in the manner
and form prescribed by Rule 41.1 of these rules. 
Unless otherwise stated in the notice of
 dismissal or stipulation, the dismissal is
without prejudice, except that a notice of
dismissal operates as an adjudication upon the
merits when filed by a plaintiff who has once
dismissed in any court of the United States, or
of any state, territory or insular possession of
the United States an action based on or
 including the same claim.
 
(Emphases added).  In the instant case, Appellee
 
11
   
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Shimojo did not  sign the December 9, 2015 stipulation
to dismiss, despite that Appellee Shimojo appeared in
this case.  Therefore, the December 9, 2015
stipulation to dismiss does not appear to satisfy the
requirements under HRCP Rule 41(a)(1)(B).   
(Underlining in the original.)
 
3. The Application for Writ of Certiorari
 
On April 14, 2016, Jhun timely filed an application for
 
writ of certiorari, which this court accepted for review. Jhun
 
presents one question -- Did the ICA gravely err by dismissing
 her appeal for lack of jurisdiction rather than ordering the
 circuit court to file a final judgment? Jhun argues that her
 notice of appeal was premature, that she addressed the potential
 jurisdictional defect in her jurisdictional statement, and that
 she asked the ICA to refrain from dismissing the appeal but
 rather allow her to obtain a judgment from the circuit court to
 perfect her appeal. Jhun explains that based on her perceived
 jurisdictional defect, she had the option of seeking a writ of
 mandamus from this court to direct the circuit court to enter a
 final judgment but chose to seek relief in the ICA pursuant to
 HRS § 602-57, which would be “just, speedy and inexpensive.” 
Jhun contends that “[t]he modern ‘Rules of Civil Procedure were
 not meant to be a game of skill where one misstep by counsel
 would be decisive to the outcome.’” (Citing Au v. Au, 63 Haw.
 210, 221, 626 P.2d 173, 181 (1981), Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S.
 41, 47 (1957), and Hall v. Kim, 53 Haw. 215, 491 P.2d 541
 
12
   
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(1971)). Jhun posits that “[t]he rule of Jenkins simply cannot
 
be applied in a case such as this, where the Circuit Court
 refuses to file a final judgment. Instead, the ICA should have
 ordered the Circuit Court to file the judgment and assumed
 jurisdiction pursuant to H.R.A.P., Rule 4(a)(2).” (Italics
 omitted and underlining added.) 
Shimojo timely filed an opposition. Shimojo argues
 
that the ICA properly dismissed the appeal. Shimojo first
 addresses the ICA’s point that the December 9, 2015 stipulation
 was not signed by him. Shimojo explains that his counsel’s
 failure to sign the stipulation was an oversight because the
 third-party claims against him had previously been “dismissed” on
 summary judgment and he was no longer participating in the
 ongoing litigation. He argued that because the stipulation
 lacked the signatures of all the parties, it was not a final
 determination of the case and the circuit court retained
 jurisdiction.
8
 
In reply, Jhun explains that she is not arguing that
 
the ICA has appellate jurisdiction; rather, the appeal is
 premature and the ICA committed grave error when it “ignored” her
 motion for an order directing the circuit court to enter a final
 judgment by dismissing the appeal and denying her motion as moot. 
8
 Shimojo states that on March 17, 2016, after the ICA issued its
 
Dismissal Order, a stipulation was filed in the circuit court that included
his counsel’s counter-part signature.  The document referenced by Shimojo is
not part of the record in the case before this court.
 
13
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Jhun further contends that the stipulation signed by Shimojo’s
 
counsel after the ICA issued its March 15, 2016 Dismissal Order
 constitutes a “fraud upon the court” because neither Shimojo nor
 his counsel were parties to the stipulation agreement. Moreover,
 Jhun argues that Shimojo’s counsel’s counterpart signature on the
 stipulation was invalid because at the time of signing (March 17,
 2016), counsel no longer represented Shimojo.
9 Jhun asks the
 
court to grant the certiorari application, vacate the ICA’s
 Dismissal Order, and remand the appeal to the ICA to order the
 circuit court to enter a final judgment and thereafter consider
 the merits of the appeal. 
II. Discussion
 
A. The Requirement of a Final Judgment 
In Jenkins, this court set forth principles for 
determining whether an order or other decision of the circuit court is appealable. Those principles are rooted in this court’s “policy against piecemeal appeals[,]” and were intended to “simplify and make certain the matter of appealability.” Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 118-19, 869 P.2d at 1337-338. 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals in civil matters from
 
“all final judgments, orders, or decrees[.]” To be effective,
 “[the] appeal must be taken in the manner . . . provided by the
9
   On February 5, 2016, before the ICA issued its Dismissal Order, Greg
 
Markham and Keith Kato of Chee Markham & Feldman withdrew as counsel for
 
Shimojo and Richard Turbin and Janice Heidt of Turbin Chu Heidt, who also
represent Waikiki, appeared as counsel for Shimojo.  
14
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
rules of court.” HRS § 641-1(c). Rule 58 of the Hawai' i Rules 
of Civil Procedure (“HRCP”) specifically requires that “[e]very
 
judgment shall be set forth on a separate document[:]”
 
Unless the court otherwise directs and subject
to the provisions of Rule 54 of these rules and Rule
23 of the Rules of the Circuit Courts, the prevailing
party shall prepare and submit a proposed judgment.
The filing of the judgment in the office of the clerk
constitutes the entry of the judgment; and the
judgment is not effective before such entry. The
 
entry of the judgment shall not be delayed for the
taxing of costs.  Every judgment shall be set forth on
a separate document.
 
Accordingly, “[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the
 
orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been
 entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant
 to [HRCP Rule] 58[.]” 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 
1338. 
In cases involving multiple claims or multiple parties,
 
a final judgment may be entered as to one or more of the claims
 or parties but only upon an express determination that there is
 no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the
 entry of judgment: 
When more than one claim for relief is presented
in an action, whether as a claim, counterclaim, cross-
claim, or third-party claim, or when multiple parties
are involved, the court may direct the entry of a
final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of
the claims or parties only upon an express
determination that there is no just reason for delay
and upon an express direction for the entry of
judgment.  In the absence of such determination and
 direction, any order or other form of decision,
however designated, which adjudicates fewer than all
the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than
 
15
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
all the parties shall not terminate the action as to
any of the claims or parties, and the order or other
form of decision is subject to revision at any time
before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the
claims and the rights and liabilities of all the
parties.
 
HRCP Rule 54(b). 
Thus, as aptly stated in Jenkins: 
(1) An appeal may be taken from circuit court orders
resolving claims against parties only after the orders
have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has
been entered in favor of and against the appropriate
parties pursuant to HRCP 58; (2) if a judgment
purports to be the final judgment in a case involving
multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment (a)
must specifically identify the party or parties for
and against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must
(i) identify the claims for which it is entered, and
(ii) dismiss any claims not specifically identified;
(3) if the judgment resolves fewer than all claims
against all parties, or reserves any claim for later
action by the court, an appeal may be taken only if
the judgment contains the language necessary for
certification under HRCP 54(b); and (4) an appeal from
any judgment will be dismissed as premature if the
judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all
claims against all parties or contain the finding
necessary for certification under HRCP 54(b).
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (emphasis omitted); 
see also Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai' i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 
1177, 1186 (2008) (“[B]ased on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order
 
is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the
 parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment.”).
 
B.	 The ICA Should Have Exercised Its Authority Under
HRS § 602-57(3) to Order the Circuit Court to Enter an
Appealable Final Judgment
 
The June 18, 2015 summary judgment order on the third-
party complaint entered in favor of Shimojo, from which Jhun

        *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
seeks to appeal, has not been reduced to a separate appealable
 
final judgment pursuant to HRS § 641-1, HRCP Rules 54 and 58, and
 Jenkins. 
The record on appeal indicates that all claims against
 
all parties have been resolved. Jhun’s third-party claims
 against Shimojo were disposed of by the summary judgment order;
 the remaining claims were disposed of by stipulation. The
 absence of a final judgment appears to be the sole factor
 hindering Jhun’s appeal. 
Jhun made several attempts to secure a final judgment. 
While the appeal was pending, Jhun submitted a proposed final
 judgment to the circuit court for approval and entry. It is
 unclear why the circuit court did not enter a final judgment.

Jhun also sought relief from the ICA for an order or writ to
 compel the circuit court to execute a final judgment if the ICA
 determined that it was necessary to establish jurisdiction but

 In Bailey v. Duvauchelle, 135 Hawai 'i 482, 353 P.3d 1024 (2015), we 
addressed the jurisdictional problems that may arise for litigants when the
requirements for finality set forth under Jenkins are not met.  We explainedthe circumstances under which the circuit courts are required to enter anappealable judgment upon a request of a party litigant: 
The circuit courts are required to enter appealable
final judgments that comport with the requirements of
Jenkins, and should resolve any material deficiency in
a judgment that is brought to their attention.  When a
 party requests that the circuit court enter an
appealable judgment after an appellate court dismisses
an appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction based on
non-compliance with Jenkins, and the circuit court
intended its ruling to be final and appealable, the
circuit court must enter an appealable judgment.

   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the ICA dismissed the motion as moot after it dismissed the
 
appeal for lack of jurisdiction.
 
Until the circuit court enters an appealable final
 
judgment, Jhun will not be able to seek review of the June 18,
 2015 summary judgment order. In light of the record before this
 court, and in the interest of judicial economy, the more
 favorable course is for a final appealable judgment to be entered
 by the circuit court. Having determined that it lacked
 jurisdiction over the appeal due to the absence of a final
 judgment and in light of Jhun’s motion requesting that it issue
 an order directing the circuit court to execute a final judgment,
 the ICA should have exercised its authority under HRS § 602­
11
 57(3) to direct the circuit court to enter an appropriate
appealable final judgment. Once an appealable final judgment is
 entered, the pending appeal will be perfected. See HRAP Rule
 
4(a)(2) (“If a notice of appeal is filed after announcement of a
 decision but before entry of the judgment or order, such notice
 shall be considered as filed immediately after the time the
 judgment or order becomes final for purposes of appeal.”).
 
III. Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the ICA’s March 15, 2016
 
Dismissal Order is vacated. The case is remanded to the ICA with
 instructions to temporarily remand the case to the circuit court
11
   HRS § 602-57(3) authorizes the ICA “[t]o make or issue any order or
 
writ necessary or appropriate in the aid of its jurisdiction[.]”

to enter an appealable final judgment, to direct the circuit
 
court to supplement the record on appeal with the final judgment,
 and to then proceed to consider the appeal accordingly.
