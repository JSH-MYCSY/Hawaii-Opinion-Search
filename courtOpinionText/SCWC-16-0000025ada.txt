 SEPTEMBER 5, 2017 
RECKTENWALD, C.J., NAKAYAMA, McKENNA, POLLACK, AND WILSON, JJ. 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J.  
 
I.  Introduction 
 Philip E. Kozma (“Kozma”) seeks review of the Intermediate 
Court of Appeals’ (“ICA”) Order Denying Without Prejudice the 
March 30, 2017 Request for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs (“order”).  
This appeal is related to a foreclosure action brought by 
Deutsche Bank National Trust Company As Indenture Trustee For 
American Home Mortgage Investment Trust 2006- 1, Mortgage- Backed 
Notes, Series 2006- 1 (“Deutsche Bank”).  On December 22, 2015, 
the Circuit Court of the Fi rst Circuit (“circuit court”) granted 
Deutsche Bank’s motion for summary judgment and decree of 
foreclosure, and Kozma appealed to the ICA.  The ICA vacated the 
circuit court’s judgment and remanded for further proceedings 
after determining Deutsche Bank failed to meet its burden of 
demonstrating that it was entitled to summary judgment.  Kozma 
then filed a “Request and Declaration of Counsel” (“request”) 
seeking attorney’s fees and costs related to his appeal, which 
the ICA denied after determining Kozma was not a “prevailing 
party” at this point in the proceeding.    
 Since the ICA essentially placed Kozma “back where he 
started,” there is no “prevailing party” entitled to attorney’s 
fees under Hawaii Revised Statutes (“ HRS”) § 607 -14 (2016).  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
3 
 Therefore, the ICA did not err in denying Kozma’s request for 
attorney’s fees.  With regard to the request for costs, however, 
the ICA applied an erroneous legal standard, which resulted in 
the incorrect conclusion that Kozma was not entitled to costs 
pursuant to Hawai‘ i Rules of Appellate Procedu re (“HRAP”) Rule 39 
(2016). 
 We accepted certiorari to clarify the law regarding 
requests for appellate attorney’s fees and costs after an 
appellate decision setting aside a trial court grant of summary 
judgment and remanding the case for further proceedings.  We 
hold that when an appellate court vacates a circuit court 
judgment entered in favor of a foreclosing mortgagee seeking 
summary judgment, the mortgagor is not a “prevailing party” 
entitled to attorney’s fees pursuant to HRS § 607 -14.  We 
further clarify that when an appellate court vacates a circuit 
court judgment entered in favor of a foreclosing mortgagee 
seeking summary judgment, pursuant to HRAP Rule 39, the 
appellate court must then use its discretion to determine which 
party, on balance, prevailed on the appeal for the purpose of an 
award of costs. 
II. Background 
A.  Circuit court proceedings 
 On March 31, 2010, Deutsche Bank initiated a foreclosure 
action against Kozma, alleging in its complaint that (1) it was ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
4 
 the owner of the promissory note and mortgage executed by Kozma 
in December 2005,1 and (2) it was entitled to foreclosure due to 
Kozma defaulting on the loan.  Deutsche Bank attached a copy of 
the note and mortgage to the complaint, along with copies of the 
assignments.  In his Answer, Kozma admitted he was in default, 
but countered that Deutsche Bank was not the real party- in-
interest able to initiate foreclosure proceedings because the 
assignments were not valid.     
 Deutsche Bank then filed a “Motion for Summary Judgment  As 
Against All Defendants And For Interlocutory Decree of 
Foreclosure” (“MSJ”).  Kozma filed his memorandum in opposition, 
arguing numerous genuine issues of material fact existed, such 
as whether Deutsche Bank possessed the original of the documents 
of the mortgage, note, and claimed assignments.  The circuit 
court2 granted summary judgment in favor of Deutsche Bank.    
 Kozma then filed a motion for reconsideration.  The circuit 
court granted the motion for reconsideration and denied without 
prejudice Deutsche Bank’s MSJ after determining that it was 
unclear whether the bankruptcy trustee for AHMAI and AHMSI’s 
                     
1 The note and mortgage were allegedly first assigned by American Home 
Acceptance, Inc. (“AHMAI”)  to American Home Mortgage Servicing, Inc. 
(“AHMSI”) by assignment dated January 8, 2008 (“first assignment”) and 
further assigned to Deutsche Bank by assignment dated March 3, 2009 (“second 
assignment”).  B oth were recorded in Land Court.  AHMAI and AHMSI had a 
consolidated bankruptcy case pending at the time of the first assignment.    
 
2 The Honorable Bert I. Ayabe presided.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
5 
 consolidated bankruptcy case had authorized the first 
assignment.    
 Deutsche Bank later filed a Renewed Motion for Summary 
Judgment (“renewed MSJ”), stating that, as the holder of the 
subject promissory note, it was entitled to enforce the subject 
mortgage.  Deutsche Bank also asserted that AHMAI and AHMSI’s 
pending bankruptcy case did not render the assignments void.   
Kozma opposed the renewed MSJ.  The circuit court3 granted 
Deutsche Bank’s second motion for summary judgment on December 
22, 2015 after it determined that Deutsche Bank was the holder 
of the indorsed in- blank Note which was secured by the Mortgage 
and thus, entitled to the foreclosure of its Mortgage.    
  Kozma appealed to the ICA. 
B. ICA proceedings 
   The ICA reviewed Kozma’s appeal in light of this court’s 
opinion in Bank of America, N.A. v. Reyes- Toledo, 139 Hawai ‘i 
361, 390 P.3d 1248 (2017) (holding if a foreclosing plaintiff 
has not demonstrated that it possessed the note at the time it 
commenced foreclosure proceedings, then a genuine issue of 
material fact exists as to whether the plaintiff is entitled to
foreclose and summary judgment is inappropriate).  The ICA 
determined that neither the copy of the note attached to  
                     
3 The Honorable Jeannette H. Castagnetti presided.  
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 Deutsche Bank’s complaint nor the supporting declaration 
established that Deutsche Bank possessed the note at the time it 
filed its complaint.  Deutsche Bank Nat’l Trust Co. v. Kozma , 
CAAP-16-0000025 (Mar. 23, 2017) (mem.) at 4.  The ICA concluded,  
viewing the facts and inferences in the light most 
favorable to Kozma, there is a genuine issue of material 
fact as to whether Deutsche Bank held the subject note at 
the time it filed the complaint . . . In light of this 
ruling, we need not address Kozma’s other arguments.   
Accordingly, the Circuit Court’s December 22, 2015 Judgment 
is vacated and this case is remanded to the Circuit Court 
for further proceedings.    
 
Id.  The ICA remanded the case for further proceedings so 
Deutsche Bank could supplement the record to show it possessed 
the note at the time it filed its complaint.  Id.    
C. Request for attorney’s fees and costs  
 Kozma then  timely filed a request for attorney’s fees  and 
costs pursuant to HRS § 607 –14 and HRAP Rule 39, seeking $440.52 
in costs and $16,625.00 in attorney’s fees.   
 The ICA denied Kozma’s request, s tating (1) “HRS § 607- 14 
does not provide authority for an award of fees where the First 
Circuit Court judgment has been vacated and the case remanded 
for further proceedings”;  and (2) “appellate costs, pursuant to 
HRAP 39(d), are not awardable because a prevailing party has not 
been determined thus far.”

 III.  Standard  of Review  
 This court reviews an ICA order granting or denying 
attorney’s fees and costs under the abuse of discretion 
standard.  Oahu Publ ’ns, Inc. v. Abercrombie , 134 Hawai ‘i 16, 22, 
332 P.3d 159, 165 (2014).  “[A]n abuse of discretion occurs 
where the . . . court has clearly exceeded the bounds of reason 
or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the 
substantial detriment of a party litigant.”   Id. (citing Ranger 
Ins. Co. v. Hinshaw , 103 Hawai ‘i 26, 30, 79 P.3d 119, 123 
(2003)).   
IV.  Discussion 
A. When an appellate court vacates a summary  judgment entered 
 in favor of a foreclosing mortgagee seeking summary 
 judgment  and remands for further proceedings,  the 
 mortgagor  is not a “prevailing party” entitled to 
 attorney’s fees pursuant to  HRS § 607- 14. 
 
 A prevailing party is entitled to attorney’s fees pursuant 
to HRS § 607- 14, which provides in relevant part,  
In all the courts, in all actions in the nature of 
assumpsit and in all actions on a promissory note or other 
contract in writing  that provides for an attorney ’s fee, 
there shall be taxed as attorneys ’ fees, to be paid by the 
losing party and to be included in the sum for which 
execution may issue, a fee that the court determines to be 
reasonable; provided that the attorney representing the 
prevailing party shall submit to the court an affidavit 
stating the amount of time the attorney spent on the action 
and the amount of time the attorney is likely to spend to 
obtain a final written judgment. . . . 
 
It follows that the first issue this court must resolve 
regarding Kozma’s  request for attorney’s fees  is whether Kozma  
is the prevailing party on appeal.  See Kaleikini v. Yoshioka, ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
8 
 129 Hawai‘ i 454, 460, 304 P.3d 252, 258 (2013) (“The first issue 
this court must resolve regarding Kaleikini’ s request for 
attorney’s fees and costs is whether Kaleikini is the prevailing 
party on appeal.”); see also Sierra Club v. Dep’ t of Transp. , 
120 Hawai‘ i 181, 215, 202 P.3d 1226, 1260 (2009) (“The first 
issue that must be determined regarding the fee and cost award 
is whether Sierra Club was the prevailing party.”).    
 To determine which party “prevailed,”  
the court “ is required to first identify the principle 
issues raised by the pleadings and proof in a particular 
case, and then determine, on balance, which party prevailed 
on the issues. ”  A party “will be deemed to be the 
successful party for the purpose of taxing costs and 
attorney’s fees ” “where [that] party prevails on the 
disputed main issue, even though not to the extent of his 
original contention[.]”  
 
Kaleikini , 129 Hawai ‘i at 461, 304 P.3d at 259 (internal 
citations omitted).  However, a prevailing party cannot always 
be determined following the adjudication of an appeal.  See Sapp 
v. Wong, 62 Haw. 34, 42, 609 P.2d 137, 142 (1980) (“[W]e must 
reverse this case on appeal, vacate the judgment and remand for 
a new trial.  Hence, appellants cannot at this time be 
considered to be the losing parties [.]”).  When a judgment on 
appeal “merely vacates a trial court judgment unfavorable to [a 
party] and places [that party] back where the [party] started,” 
the judgment “does not, in itself, provide any grounds for an 
award of attorney’s fees to the [party].”  Nelson v. Univ.  of 
Hawai‘i, 99 Hawai ‘i 262, 266, 54 P.3d 433, 437 (2002). ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

  On certiorari, Kozma argues that he prevailed on a disputed 
main issue because he sought to have the decree of foreclosure 
vacated and remanded to the trial court.  Kozma alleged in his 
opposition to the renewed MSJ and on appeal to the ICA that 
Deutsche Bank was not entitled to summary judgment as a matter 
of law because a genuine issue of material fact existed as to 
whether the assignments were valid.     
 The ICA did not address the issue of the validity of the 
assignments nor any of the other issues  raised by Kozma when 
disposing of Kozma’s appeal.   Instead, the ICA only addressed 
whether, under the requirement recently iterated in Reyes-
Toledo, Deutsche Bank had met its burden of demonstrating that 
it was entitled to summary judgment as a holder of the note at 
the time it filed the foreclosure complaint.  Kozma, mem. op. at 
4.  After determining that, in light of Reyes-Toledo, a genuine 
issue of material fact existed as to whether Deutsche Bank held 
the subject note at the time it filed the complaint, the ICA 
vacated the circuit court judgment and remanded for further 
proceedings.  Id.   This served the procedural function of 
putting Kozma “back in the place he started” with regard to the 
foreclosure action without addressing a “disputed main issue .”  
Therefore, Kozma  is not a “prevailing party” and  is not entitled 
to attorney’s fees  under HRS § 607-14.  Thus, the ICA did not 
err in denying Kozma’s request for attorney’s fees . ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
10 
  The facts in Kozma’s appeal are common in requests for fees 
and costs following appeals related to foreclosure proceedings.  
Thus, we now clarify that when the ICA vacates a summary 
judgment entered in favor of a foreclosing mortgagee and remands 
the case for further proceedings, the mortgagor is not a 
“prevailing party” entitled to attorney’s fe es pursuant to H RS § 
607-14. 
B. The ICA applied an erroneous legal standard in its order 
 denying Kozma’s request for costs.  
 On certiorari, Kozma argues that he is the prevailing party 
entitled to costs pursuant to HRAP Rule 39. 
 HRAP Rule 39 provides, in relevant part, “ if a judgment is 
affirmed in part and reversed in part, or is vacated, or a 
petition granted in part and denied in part, the costs shall be 
allowed only as ordered by the appellate court. ”  HRAP Rule 
39(a) (2016 ).  “The intent of [HRAP Rule 39] is to allow the 
party prevailing on appeal  to recover those costs reasonably 
incurred in prosecuting the appeal. ”  Jou v. Argonaut Ins. Co. , 
133 Hawai ‘i 471, 477, 331 P.3d 449, 455 (2014) (quoting Leslie v. 
Estate of Tavares, 93 Hawai‘ i 1, 7, 994 P.2d 1047, 1053 (2000)) 
(emphasis in original).  To determine which party prevailed on 
appeal, the appellate court may “ evaluat[e] the remedy sought by 
the appellant in conjunction with the remedy granted on appeal ,” 
or “determine, on balance, which party prevailed on the ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
11 
 [disputed main] issues .”  Jou, 133 Hawai ‘i at 477 -78, 331 P.3d at 
455-56 (citations and emphases  omitted).  
 Hawaiian Ass’n of Seventh -Day Adventists v. Wong , 130 
Hawai‘i 36, 50, 305 P.3d 452, 466 (2013),  illustrates the 
application of HRAP Rule 39 when a summary judgment is vacated 
and remanded.  A dispute arose between Seventh -Day Adventists 
(“SDA”) and Wong regarding whether a lease agreement prohibited 
certain uses of the cabins on the leased property.
  Seventh-Day 
Adventists , 130 Hawai ‘i at 43, 46, 305 P.3d at  459, 462.  Both 
parties filed motions for summary judgment and the trial court 
granted motions for summary judgment to each party on different 
counts.  130 Hawai ‘i at 43, 305 P.3d at 459.  SDA appealed from 
one grant of summary judgment in favor of Wong; Wong cross-
appealed from three of the grants of summary judgment in favor 
of SDA.  Id.   The ICA vacated one of the trial court’s grants of 
summary judgment for SDA and affirmed the trial c ourt’s decision 
as to the remaining grants of summary judgment.  130 Hawai ‘i at 
44, 305 P.3d at 460.  SDA requested fees and costs related to 
the appeal, and the ICA granted an award of costs after 
determining SDA had prevailed on the appeal.  Id.  On 
certiorari, this court determined that an ambiguity in the lease 
at issue meant several of the trial court’s grants of summary 
judgment were inappropriate and vacated the trial court’s 
decisions on these counts.  130 Hawai ‘i at 49, 305 P.3d at 465.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
12 
 As both parties had stipulated that the lease was unambiguous, 
this court “[concluded] that neither party [had] prevailed on 
the appeal ” and vacated the ICA’s award of costs for SDA.  130 
Hawai‘i at 46, 50, 305 P.3d at  462, 466 (emphasis added).   
 Seventh-Day Adventists  helps elucidate the application of 
HRAP Rule 39 when a grant of summary judgment is vacated and 
remanded, as does Jou, 133 Hawai‘ i 471, 331 P.3d 449.  The 
holding in Jou established that an appellate court should not 
look outside the appellate proceedings when determining an award 
of costs pursuant to HRAP Rule 39.  Id.  In Jou, this court 
vacated the ICA’s order denying costs after determining the ICA 
erroneously looked at the entire proceeding when determining a 
prevailing party for an award of costs pursuant to HRAP Rule 39.  
133 Hawai‘ i at 480, 331 P.3d at 458.  Jou appealed from two 
circuit court orders granting motions in favor of Hawai ‘i 
Employers Medical Insurance Company, one of which the ICA 
vacated and remanded for further proceedings.  133 Hawai ʻi at 
473-74, 331 P.3d 451- 52.  Jou then requested costs related to 
that order pursuant to HRAP Rule 39.  133 Hawai ‘i at 475, 331 
P.3d at 454.  The ICA denied Jou’s request and concluded, 
“[a]ppellate costs are not awardable absent a prevailing party 
in the case. ”  Id. (emphasis added).  On certiorari, this court 
determined that, contrary to the legal standard applied by the 
ICA, the standard iterated in Seventh- Day Adventists  required ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
13 
 the ICA to determine which party prevailed on the appeal  for the 
purpose of awarding costs under HRAP Rule 39.  Jou, 133 Hawai ‘i 
at 480, 331 P.3d at 458.  After applying the correct legal 
standard, this court concluded that since the ICA “granted Jou 
the sole remedy he sought,” he was the prevailing party on 
appeal entitled to costs pursuant to HRAP Rule 39.  133 Hawai ‘i 
at 481, 331 P.3d at 459. 
 The ICA’s  order here states that costs are not awardable 
because “a prevailing party has not been determined thus far ,” 
and cites to Seventh-Day Adventists.  However, this case is 
distinguishable from Seventh-Day Adventists  because in the 
latter, neither party prevailed on appeal since summary 
judgments for each party were vacated on a ground that both 
parties had stipulated did not exist.  T his case is instead very 
similar to Jou.  As it did in Jou, the ICA looked beyond the 
appellate procedure to determine whether there was a prevailing 
party entitled to HRAP Rule 39 costs.  We use this opportunity 
to make explicit that when the ICA vacates a circuit court 
judgment entered in favor of a foreclosing mortgagee seeking 
summary judgment, then the appellate court must use its 
discretion to determine which party prevailed on the appeal  for 
the purpose of an award of costs pursuant to HRAP Rule 39.  
Since the ICA vacated the grant of summary judgment for Deutsche 
Bank, which was the remedy Kozma sought, it follows that Kozma ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
14 
 was the successful party on appeal entitled to HRAP Rule 39 
costs.   
V.  Conclusion 
 For the aforementioned reasons, we affirm the portion of 
the judgment denying attorney’s fees pursuant to HRS § 607-14 
and vacate the portion of the ICA’s judgment denying costs 
pursuant to HRAP Rule 39.
