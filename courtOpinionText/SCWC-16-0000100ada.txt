OPINION OF THE COURT BY WILSON, J. 
 
  This case arises from a pat-down following an  
investigative stop in April 2014 , in Honolulu.  The pat- down 
occurred after a lieutenant with the Honolulu Police Department 
(“HPD”) noticed Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant Kekoa Iona 
(“Iona”) and two other individuals riding bicycles lacking tax 
decals, which are required by law on all bicycles with wheels 
twenty inches or more in diameter.   Electronically Filed

2   T he police may, in appropriate circumstances and in an 
appropriate manner, detain individuals for brief, temporary 
investigative stops based on reasonable suspicion of a crime 
without violating the prohibition on unreasonable searches and 
seizures in the United States and Hawaiʻi Constitutions.   
However, the police may not prolong these  temporary detentions, 
known as Terry stops,  any longer than needed to handle the 
matter for which the stop was made.   1
  We hold that Iona was seized longer than was necessary 
for the police to conduct an  investigation that confirmed the 
lieutenant’s reasonable suspicion that the required tax decal 
was missing and to issue a citation  to Iona for riding a bicycle 
without a tax decal.   
  A fter the time necessary for the police to conduct an 
investigation confirming the absence of the required tax decal  
and to issue a citation for the missing decal had expired, a 
warrant check came back from dispatch indicating that Iona had 
an outstanding warrant.  Iona was arrested at the scene based on 
the outstanding warrant, and a search incident to arrest 
revealed a small amount of drugs and drug paraphernalia.  
Because the warrant check came back after the span of time 
                     
 1 See Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 22 (1968)  (recognizing “that a 
police officer may in appropriate circumstances and in an appropriate manner 
approach a person for purposes of investigating possibly criminal behavior 
even though there is no prob able cause to make an arrest”) . *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
3 necessary for the police to obtain Iona’s identifying 
information from him and to write and issue the citation
, Iona’s 
arrest was illegal.  Since th
e arrest was illegal, the evidence 
obtained as a result of the arrest was fruit of the poisonous 
tree.  Iona’s pre-trial motion to suppress the evidence from the 
search incident to arrest
 should have been granted, and the 
evidence seized as a result of that search should have been 
excluded from his trial.  Accordingly, we vacate the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals ’ (“ICA”) judgment on appeal and 
the Circuit Court of the First Circuit ’s (“circuit court ”) 
judgment of conviction and sentence, and we remand the case to 
the circuit court for proceedings consistent with this opinion. 
I.  Background 
  
At 10:40 a.m. on April 17, 2014, Lieutenant  Brent 
Kagawa, an officer with the HPD , observed Iona and two other 
individuals on bicycles ride past him on Keeau moku Street in 
Honolulu.  All three bicycles lacked tax decals, which all 
standard-sized bikes are required to display by state and local 
law.  Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes (“ HRS”) §§ 249-14, 249-15 (2001);2 
Revised Ordinances of Honolulu (“ ROH”) § 15-18.1 (Supp. 1995) .3   
                     
 2 HRS § 249 -14(a) requires the owner of a bicycle with wheels 
twenty inches or more in diameter to register the bicycle and pay a 
registration fee.  Upon payment of the fee and registration, the owner is 
furnished with “ a metallic tag or decal[,]” which must be affixed to the 
bicycle on “ the upright post attached to the sprocket facing in the forward 
 
(continued  . . .) *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
4   Having observed what appeared to be the absence of the 
required decals, Lieutenant Kagawa identified himself, stopped 
all three men, and, in the words of the circuit court’s findings 
of fact, “initiated an untaxed bicycle inqu iry.  He informed the 
three males that he had stopped them for untaxed bicycles. ”  The 
officer queried the men individually about the status of the 
bikes.  Initially, each man stated he owned the bike he was 
riding.  As Lieutenant Kagawa took down this information, 
however, Iona changed his statement to say that he borrowed the 
bike from someone named “Nalu” at the park.  Lieutenant Kagawa 
took some additional information, including their names, and 
then commenced a warrant check on all three individuals.  
Lieutenant Kagawa estimated this initial exchange took about 
three or four minutes. 
  In the meantime, two additional officers, Officers 
Alison Lynch and Raymond Chandler, arrived at the scene to 
                                                                               
(. . . continued) 
 
direction.”  HRS § 249 -14(b).  HRS § 249 -15 authorizes police officers to 
seize a bicycle to which no tag or decal is affixed.  
 
 3 ROH § 15- 18.1 provides: 
 
 No person who resides within the City and County of 
Honolulu shall ride or propel a bicycle on any street, 
highway, alley, roadway or sidewalk or upon any public path 
set aside for the exclusive use of bicycles unless such 
bicycle has been licensed and a license plate two by three 
inches in size, or a license decal, is attached thereto as 
provided in this article.  
 
The penalty for violating the decal requirement is a fine of between $15.00 
and $100.00 for a first offense.  ROH § 15 -26.9(b) ( Supp. 2004). *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
5 assist Lieutenant Kagawa.  Officer Lynch called nearby officers  
to assist.  When they arrived, Lieutenant Kagawa informed the 
two additional officers of the facts of the untaxed bicycle 
investigation and asked them to take over the investigation.  
Lieutenant Kagawa testified that he was waiting until he had all 
the information at the end of the investigation before 
determining whether he would issue a citation for the lack of 
tax decals. 
  Officers Lynch and Chandler sought
 to obtain the 
bicycles’ serial numbers and run them through the system to 
determine whether they were registered and, if registered, 
whether they were reported stolen.  The officers were only able 
to read the serial number on t
he bike Iona had been riding.  
Once that serial number had been obtained, Officer s Lynch and 
Chandler called dispatch to check the bike registration records 
in order to determine whether the bike was taxed or untaxed or 
had been reported stolen. 
 
 After a few minutes, dispatch confirmed that the bike 
was not registered to Iona or to  someone named Nalu.  Instead, 
the bike was registered to a Wai ʻanae res
ident.  The bike had not 
been reported stolen.  Officer Chandler attempted to contact the 
registered owner but was unsuccessful.  He then contacted the 
police station in Wai ʻanae and req
uested that an officer from *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
6 that station drive to 
the registered owner ’s Waiʻanae address
 in 
order to determine whether the bike was stolen.  
 
 The warrant check came back at  10:54 a.m., showing 
that Iona had an outstanding $100.00 bench warrant for contempt.   
A total of fourteen minutes elapsed between the initial stop and 
the return of the outstanding warrant information.  At no time 
within the fourteen- minute period was a citation for failure to 
display a tax decal written or started to be written .  Iona was 
arrested at the scene on the outstanding warrant.  Incident to 
his arrest, he was patted down.  The pat- down revealed a glass 
pipe in a plastic sleeve as well as a small, ziplock plastic bag 
containing a white, crystalline substance. 
 
 Prio r to trial, Iona moved to suppress the glass pipe 
and the ziplock bag containing a white, crystalline  substance, 
arguing that they were “fruit of the poisonous tree. ”  He argued  
that he had been illegally seized, that the seizure continued 
well after its initial justification, that his arrest was 
therefore illegal, and that the evidence seized in the search 
incident to his arrest was “fruit of the poisonous tree ” and 
should thus be excluded.  He also argued that (1) a violation of 
HRS § 249-14 is not an arr estable offense, (2) the only penalty 
authorized for a violation of HRS § 249- 14 is the seizure of a 
bicycle that does not display the required registration decal, 
(3) Lieutenant Kagawa did not have reasonable suspicion to *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
7 further detain Iona in order to determine if he had an 
outstanding bench warrant, (4) Lieutenant Kagawa had no basis to 
request a warrant check on Iona at the point in time that he did 
because Lieutenant
 Kagawa did not suspect Iona of committing an 
arrestable crime or violation at that time, and (5) Lieutenant 
Kagawa was not authorized to conduct a warrant
 check under HRS § 
803-6 (2014).  
4  Iona was tried on October 12, 2015.   After a bench 
trial on stipulated facts, Iona was convicted of one count of 
promoting a dangerous drug in the third degree and one count of 
unlawful use of drug paraphernalia.  See  HRS § 712 -1243 (2014); 
HRS § 329-43.5(a) (2010).  He was sentenced to two open five-
year terms of imprisonment, to run concurrently, and fined 
$1,000.  He appealed to the ICA. 
  The ICA issued its summary disposition order on June 
29, 2017.  State v. Iona, No. CAAP-16- 0000100, 2017 WL 2812940 
(App. June 29, 2017) ( SDO).  The  ICA concluded that the evidence 
discovered in the search incident to Iona’s arrest on the 
outstanding warrant was not fruit of the poisonous tree.  Id.  at 
*3.  It held that the length of the stop was reasonable “[b]ased 
on the police testimony regarding the steps regularly taken in 
conjunction with an untaxed bicycle investigation” and “Iona’s 
                     
 4 The Honorable Edward H. Kubo, Jr. presided.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
8 shifting statements regard ing the bicycle’s ownership, which 
were inconsistent with the bicycle’s registration [.]”  Id. at 
*2.  As to Iona’s pretext argument, the ICA held that there was 
“no evidence that follow up inquiries regarding the bicycle’s 
ownership were pretextual or that the officers delayed the 
attempts to reach the registered owner of the bicycle in order 
to prolong the warrant check.”  Id.  Accordingly, t he ICA 
affirmed the circuit court’s judgment  of conviction and 
sentence.  Id. at *3.  Iona applied for a writ of certiorari, 
and his application was accepted. 
II.  Standards of Review 
 
 An appellate court reviews a trial court’s ruling on a 
motion to suppress de novo to determine whether, as a matter of 
law, the ruling was right or wrong.  State v. Eleneki , 106 
Hawaiʻi 177, 180,
 102 P.3d 1075, 1078 (2004).  A court ’s findings 
of fact “are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard, and 
will not be set aside on appeal unless they are determined to be 
clearly erroneous.”   State v. Kaleohano, 99 Hawaiʻ i 370, 375, 56 
P.3d 138, 143 (2002) (internal citations and quotation marks 
omitted). 
III.  Discussion  
  
Both the Fourth Amendment to the United States 
Constitution and article I , section 7 of the Hawai ʻi Constitution 
“safeguard the privacy and security of indivi duals against *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
9 arbitrary invasions by governmental officials.”  State v. Navas, 
81 
Hawaiʻi 113, 122, 913 P.2d 39, 48 (1996) (quoting Camara v. 
Mun. Court, 387 U.S. 523, 528 (1967)); see State v. Tau ʻa, 98 
Hawaiʻi 426, 446  n.5, 49 P.3d 1227, 1247 n.5 (2002) (Acoba, J., 
dissenting) (“The fourth amendment was intended both to protect 
the rights of individuals and to prevent the government from 
functioning as in a police state. ” (quoting Donald L. Doernberg, 
The Right of the People: Reconciling Collective and Individual 
Interests Under the Fourth Amendment, 58 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 259, 260 
(1983))).  Both prohibit unreasonable searches and seizures by 
government officials
.  U.S. Const. amend. IV (prohibiting 
“unreasonable searches and seizures” and requiring  a warrant 
based on probable cause as a condition of any search or 
seizure); Haw. Const. art. I, § 7 (prohibiting “unreasonable 
searches, seizures and invasions of privacy” and requ iring a 
warrant based on probable cause
 as a condition of any search or 
seizure).  
  Given  these constitutional protections, w arrantless 
searches or seizures are presumed  “invalid unless and until the 
prosecution proves that the search or seizure falls within a 
well-recognized and narrowly defined exception to the warrant *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
10 5requirement.”   State v. Prendergast, 103 Hawaiʻ i 451, 454, 83 
P.3d 714, 717 (2004).  “If the prosecution fails to meet this 
burden, the evidence obtained from the illegal search will be 
suppressed as ‘fruit of the poisonous tree. ’”  Id. (quoting 
State v. Fukusaku, 85 Hawaiʻi 462, 475, 946 P.2d 32, 45 (1997)). 
A.  Constitutional Principles Governing Terry Stops 
  The t emporary investigative detention  of an individual 
by the police without a warrant is constitutionally permissible 
only within strict and narrow limits.  Terry, 392 U.S. at 19 
(“The scope of the search  must be ‘strictly tied to and 
justified by’ the circumstances which rendered its initiation 
permissible. ” (quoting Warden, Md. Penitentiary v. Hayden, 387 
U.S. 294, 310 (1967) (Fortas, J., concurring)));  Kaleohano, 99 
Hawaiʻi at 378–
79, 56 P.3d at 146 –47 (“Because temporary 
investigative stops involve an exception to the general rule 
requiring that searches and seizures be supported by probable 
cause, the scope of s uch detentions must be narrow.” ).   
  The se strict limitations on the constitutionally 
permissible scope of a Terry stop govern both its initiation and 
                     
 5 We have held repeatedly that exceptions to the warrant 
requirement are well -recognized and narrowly defined, and generally “provide 
for those cases where the societal costs of obtaining a warrant, such as 
danger to law officers or the risk of loss or destruction of evidence, 
outweigh the reasons for prior recourse to a neutral magistrate.”  State v. 
Wallace, 80 Hawaiʻi 382, 393, 910 P.2d 695, 706 (1996) (quoting State v. 
Clark, 65 Haw. 488, 493, 654 P.2d 355, 360 (1982)). *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
11 its duration.  The initiation of a temporary investigative 
detention by police is valid 
only “if they have a reasonable 
suspicion based on 
specific and articulable facts that criminal 
activity is afoot.”  State v. Spillner, 116 Hawai ʻi 351, 357, 173 
P.3d 498, 504 (2007) (quoting State v. Kearns, 75 Haw. 558, 569, 
867 P.2d 903, 908 (1994)
); State v. Heapy, 113 Hawaiʻi 283, 285, 
151 P.3d 764, 766 (2007) (“It is axiomatic that reasonable 
suspicion to justify a stop must relate to criminal activity. ”); 
State v. Barnes, 58 Haw. 333, 337, 568 P.2d 1207, 1211 (1977) 
(explaining that “such an intrusion upon personal liberty must 
be reasonable and be 
based on something more substantial than 
inarticulate hunches ” (quoting State v. Goudy, 52 Haw. 497, 501, 
479 P.2d 800, 803 (1971))).  In addition, under the Hawaiʻi 
Constitution, a Terry stop may last no longer than is absolutely 
necessary under the circu
mstances to handle the matter for which 
the stop was made.  State v. Estabillio, 121 Hawai ʻi 261, 271, 
218 P.3d 749, 759 (2009) (“In order to pass constitutional 
muster, the length of time the officer could permissibly detain 
the defendant must have been ‘no greater in intensity than 
absolutely necessary under the circumstances .’” (emphasis added)  
(brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Barros, 98 Hawaiʻ i 337, 342 -
43, 48 P.3d 584, 589-90 (2002)) ). 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
12 B.   The Perez Test and Vehicle Stops 
  In Hawai ʻi, the constitutional principles governing 
unreasonable searches and seizures in the context of traffic 
stops have been synthesized into a two-part test.  See State v. 
Perez, 111 Hawai‘ i 392, 397, 141 P.3d 1039, 1044 (2006).  Unless 
the police action during a vehicle stop satisfies both parts of 
the Perez test, the police action is unlawful, and “the evidence 
originating from that unlawful action must be suppressed. ”  
State v. Alvarez, 138 Hawaiʻi 173, 182, 378 P.3d 889, 898  (2016). 
  The first part of the Perez test requires that the 
investigative stop must be justified at its inception.  Perez , 
111 Hawai ʻi at 397, 141 P.3d at 1044. 
 “To justify an 
investigative stop, . . . the police officer must be able to 
point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together 
with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant 
that intrusion.”  Alvarez, 138 Hawai ʻi at 182, 378 P.3d at 898 
(ellipses in original) ( quoting Barnes, 58 Haw. at 338, 568 P.2d 
at 1211); see also Estabillio , 121 Hawai‘i at 273, 218 P.3d at 
761 (holding that under the first part of the Perez test, a 
seizure was clearly justified at its inception when the officer 
had a reasonable suspicion that the defendant was “ driving a 
vehicle with a fraudulent registration sticker ”). 
  The second part of the Perez test requires that a 
search or seizure must be “ reasonably related in scope to the *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
13 circumstances which justified the interference in the first 
place.”  Alvarez, 138 Hawai‘i at 182, 378 P.3d at 898 (quoting 
Perez, 111 Hawaiʻ i at 397, 141 P.3d at 1044).  The 
constitutionally permissible scope of a vehicle stop has two 
components.  First, “it must ‘last no lon ger than is necessary 
to effectuate the purpose of the detention.’”   Id. (quoting 
Estabillio, 121 Hawai ʻi at 270, 218 P.3d at 758); see also 
Estabillio, 121 Hawai ʻi at 271, 218 P.3d at 759 (“In order to 
pass constitutional muster, the length of time the officer could 
permissibly detain the defendant must have been ‘no greater in 
6intensity than absolutely necessary under the circumstances .’” 
(brackets omitted) (quoting Barros, 98 Hawaiʻi at 342-43, 48 P.3d 
at 589-90)).  “Second, the subject matter and intensity of the 
investigative detention must be limited to that which is 
justified by the initial stop. ”  Alvarez
, 138 Hawaiʻi at 182, 378 
P.3d at 898.  
 
                     
 6 The “absolutely necessary under the circumstances” standard 
derives from our view that  
 
the right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures under 
article, I, section [7] of the Hawaii Constitution is enforceable 
by a rule of reason which requires that governmental intrusions 
into the personal privacy of citizens of this State be no greater 
in intensity than absolutely necessary under the circumstances.   
 
State v. Kaluna, 55 Haw. 361, 369, 520 P.2d 51, 58 –59 (1974) ( internal 
quotation marks and footnote omitted).  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
14 C.  Under the circumstances presented here, t he officers’ 
seizure of Iona exceeded the scope of a constitutionally 
permissible vehicle stop.  
  
Lieutenant Kagawa stopped Iona while Iona was riding a 
bicycle.  For present purposes we consider a bicycle stop to be 
a traffic stop (also called a vehicle stop).  “A stop of a 
vehicle for an investigatory purpose constitutes a seizure 
within the meaning of the constitutional protection against 
unreasonable searches and seizures.”  Estabillio , 121 Hawai
ʻi at 
270, 218 P.3d at 758 (quoting State v. Bolosan, 78 Hawai ʻi 86, 
92, 890 P.2d 673, 679 (1995)) ; Spillner, 116 Hawaiʻi at 357, 173 
P.3d at 504 (“There is no dispute that a traffic stop is a form 
of seizure for constitutional purposes .”).  Thus, Iona was 
seized when Lieutenant Kagawa ordered him off his bike.  As to 
its duration, Lieutenant Kagawa acknowledged during the hearing 
on Iona’s motion to suppress  that the seizure lasted up to the 
point at which Iona was arrested.
 
  Having established that Iona was “seized” for 
constitutional purposes, we proceed to analyze  the facts in 
light of the two-part Perez test .  We assume without deciding 
that the first part of the Perez test, that “the action was 
justified at its inception,” was satisfied here.  Perez, 111 
Hawaiʻi at 397, 141
 P.3d at 1044.  Lieutenant Kagawa observed 
that the bicycles of all three individuals he stopped lacked tax 
decals.  Assuming that the lieutenant’s observation concerning *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
15 the missing tax decals is analogous to observing a violation
 of 
traffic laws, the action was justified at its inception.  
Alvarez, 138 Hawai ‘i at 182, 378 P.3d at 898 (“It is well settled 
that an investigative stop based on an officer’ s observation of 
an apparent traffic violation satisfies the first part of the 
Perez test.”).   
  As to the second part of the Perez test, we hold that 
the time during which Iona was seized exceeded the duration 
necessary to accomplish the purpose for which he was stopped.  
See id.  Here, the matter or purpose for which the stop was made 
was determined by Lieutenant  Kagawa’s observation that the bikes 
lacked tax decals.  That lack of decals is what justified the 
initial stop of Iona.  The circuit  court’s findings of fact 
based on testimony at the suppression hearing state that “Lt. 
Kagawa initiated an untax ed bicycle investigation” and that he 
informed the riders “he had stopped them for untaxed bicycles.”   
However, it is undisputed that Iona was never  cited during the 
Terry stop for riding a bicycle which failed to display a tax 
decal. 
  Instead , Iona was held until a warrant check was 
completed.  Rather than issue a citation for failure to display 
a tax decal, the police called dispatch to determine if the bike 
was registered and, if so
, to identity the owner and determine 
whether the bike was reported stolen.  Dispatch confirmed the *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
16 bike was registered and that it was not reported stolen.7  The 
pursuit of inquiry relevant to theft was not the purpose of the 
stop, although the stop was used as an opportunity to make such 
inquiries.8 
  Because what justified the initial stop was the lack 
of a tax decal on the bike Iona
 was riding, the time span needed 
to handle that matter was the sum of the time required under the 
circumstances for Lieutenant Kagawa to confirm his reasonable 
suspicion that the decals were missing, the time necessary to 
obtain the identifying information of Iona required to fill out 
the citation for riding without a decal
, and the time necessary 
to write and issue the citation.   See State v. Wyatt , 67 Haw. 
293, 300, 687 P.2d 544, 549 (1984) (“The obvious violation of 
the Traffic Code gave [the officers] reason to seek information 
necessary for the issuance of a citation. ”).  It took only 
seconds to confirm the decals were missing.  Lieutenant Kagawa 9
                     
 7 The police  “may investigate matters unrelated to the original 
stop if they have an independent  basis for reasonable suspicion to indicate 
that criminal activity is afoot[.]”   Alvarez, 138 Hawaiʻ i at 184, 378 P.3d at 
900 (emphasis added).  Here, however, there was no such basis.  At oral 
argument, the State conceded that no theft investigation occurred at any 
point. 
   
 8 Calls were made by the police to locate the owner without 
success; consequently , police at the scene called the Waiʻ anae police station 
and requested that it  send an officer to the 
registered owner’s residence.  
 
 9 HRS § 291C -165(a) (2007) states that “[t]
here shall be provided 
for use by authorized police officers, a form of summons or citation for use 
in citing violators of those traffic laws which do not mandate the physical 
arrest of such violators.”  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
17 testified that Iona gave him his correct name and date of birth 
within “maybe three, four minutes” after the initial stop.  The 
warrant check came back fourteen minutes after the initial stop. 
  
Under these circumstances, it was not constitutionally 
permissible for the police to forego the issuance of a citation 
and hold Iona.  See
 Estabillio, 121 Hawai ʻi  at 271, 218 P.3d at
 
759 (“In order to pass constitutional muster, the length of time 
the officer could permissibly detain the defendant must have 
been ‘no greater in intensity than absolutely necessary under 
the circumstances.’” ( emphasis added) (brackets omitted) 
(quoting Barros, 98 Hawaiʻi at 342- 43, 48 P.3d at 589-90)).  
Officers have the discretion to confiscate a bicycle “ liable for 
the payment of the required fees or which has no tag or decal 
affixed as required by section 249- 14[.]”  HRS § 249 -15.  At 
oral argument, the S tate took the position that the 
constitutionally permissible duration of the Terry  stop at issue 
here could last as long as it took the officers in their 
discretion to decide whether or not to confiscate the bicycle.

We disagree.   
  What justified the initial Terry  stop of Iona was a 
missing tax decal.  As Lieutenant  Kagawa testified, he stopped 
all three riders for violating a “[r]evised ordinance,” *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
18 specifically, “1481 or something to that – - I’d have to look it 
up.”  The ordinance that authorizes a police officer to issue a 
citation for a missing tax decal, ROH § 15-18.1 , applies to any  
resident bicycle rider; it is not specific to the registered 
owner: 
 No person who resides within the City and County of 
Honolulu shall ride or propel a bicycle on any street, 
highway, alley, roadway or sidewalk or upon any public path 
set aside for the exclusive use of bicycles unless such 
bicycle has been licensed and a license plate two by three 
inches in size, or a license decal, is attached thereto as  
provided in this article.  
 
See also ROH § 15-26.9  (stating that “it is a violation for any 
person to violate any of the provisions of this traffic code” 
and providing for a range of fines); HRS § 291C -165(a) (“ There 
shall be provided for use by authorized police officers, a form 
of summons or citation for use in citing violators of those 
traffic laws which do not mandate the physical arrest of such 
violators.”).   
  For the police to issue the relevant citation under 
the ordinance, it is not necessary for the police to know 
whether the rider of the bicycle is also its owner.  Therefore,  
the subject matter of the investigative detention for which Iona 
was seized was limited to a citation for the missing decal.  See  
Alvarez, 138 Hawai ‘i at 182, 378 P.3d at 89 8 (“
[T]he subject 
matter and intensity of the investigative detention must be 
limited to that which is justified by the initial stop. ”).  Once *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
19 the investigation relating to that subject matter was complete, 
the police should have informed Iona that he was free  to leave , 
regardless of whether the police decided to confiscate the 
bicycle. 
 
 In conclusion, the phase of Iona’s investigative 
detention relating to a police decision whether or not to 
confiscate the bicycle was  not “reasonably related in scope to 
the circumstances which justified the interference in the first 
place.”  Id. (quoting Perez, 111 Hawai ʻi at 397, 141 P.3d 1044) ; 
see Rodriguez v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 1609, 1612 (2015) (“A 
seizure justified only by a police -observed traffic violation   
. . . ‘becomes unlawful if it is prolonged beyond the time 
reasonably required to complete the mission ’ of issuing a ticket 
for the violation.” ( brackets omitted) (quoting Illinois v. 
Caballes, 543 U.S. 405, 407 (2005))). 
  Because the constitutionally permissible duration of 
the stop was limited to the time necessary to confirm the 
violation, obtain identification necessary to issue a citation, 
and write the citation,  Iona’s detention could not be prolonged 
by Lieutenant Kagawa to conduct a warrant check.  By detaining 
Iona longer than necessary to write the citation, Lieutenant 
Kagawa clearly exceeded the reasonable time necessary to 
accomplish the purpose of the stop.  Since  the arrest was 
illegal, the evidence obtained as a result of the arrest was *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
20 “fruit of the poisonous tree.”  Prendergast, 103 Hawai ʻi
 at 454, 
83 P.3d at 717 (quoting Fukusaku , 85 Hawaiʻi at 475, 946 P.2d at 
45).  Iona’s pre -trial motion to suppress the evidence from the 
search incident to arrest should have been granted, and the 
evidence seized as a result of that search should have been 
excluded from his trial.   
IV.  Conclusion  
  For the reasons stated above, we vacate the ICA’s July 
28, 2017 judgment on appeal and  the circuit court’s January 25, 
2016 judgment of conviction and sentence, and we remand the case 
to the circuit court for proceedings consistent with this 
opinion.
