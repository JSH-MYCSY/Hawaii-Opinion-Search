(“circuit court”) filed two orders. The first found 
Respondent/Plaintiff-Appellant OneWest Bank, F.S.B. (“OneWest”), 
the foreclosing mortgagee and winning bidder at the foreclosure 
auction, liable for damages in an amount equal to its down 
payment for its failure to close the foreclosure sale. The 
second awarded that down payment amount as expectation damages 
to Petitioner/Defendant-Appellee the Association of the Owners 
of the Kumulani at the Uplands at Mauna Kea (“the Association”), 
a junior lienholder. Because creditors in a judicial 
foreclosure action are “entitled to payment according to the 
priority of their liens,” Hawaiʻi Revised  Statutes (“HRS”)  § 667-
3 (2016),
 we hold that the circuit court abused its discretion 
by awarding damages to the Association, rather than by applying 
the down payment amount to reduce the debt owed to OneWest. 
I. BACKGROUND 
A. Circuit Court Proceedings 
1. Foreclosure Action, Auctions, and Confirmation of Sale 
On September 23, 2011, OneWest commenced a judicial 
foreclosure action by filing a complaint in the circuit court. 
OneWest alleged that Diana G. Brown (“Brown”) had defaulted on a 
$548,000.00 note and mortgage assigned to OneWest that covered 
Brown’s fee simple interest in an apartment in a condominium

project called the Kumulani at the Uplands at Mauna Kea.1 
OneWest alleged that Brown was in breach of the note and 
mortgage, and that it was entitled to foreclosure of the 
mortgage, payment from the sale of the mortgaged property, and 
monetary judgment against Brown. 
On October 21, 2011, the Association, one of the 
defendants in the foreclosure action, filed its answer. The 
Association claimed that it had “a lien for all sums assessed 
but unpaid for the share of common expenses chargeable to the 
subject property” under HRS § 514B-146(a) (Supp. 2011). It 
asked that the circuit court determine the priority of the 
parties’ claims, but did not ask for any other relief except for 
reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs and further relief as the 
court deemed just and equitable. 
On July 5, 2013, OneWest moved for summary judgment 
against the Association and for an order for an interlocutory 
1 OneWest also named as defendants D. Michael Dunne, successor 
trustee of the revocable living trust of Harold G. Strand and Margaret M. 
Strand; Jerry Ivy; Omni Financial, Inc.; Citibank (South Dakota), N.A.; the 
Association; and various John Does and Doe entities “who have or may claim 
some right, title or interest in the property which is the subject of this 
action.” OneWest stated that the other named defendants “may have or claim 
an interest in the Mortgaged Property,” but that any of these interests were 
junior to its own. 
Defendants Brown, Dunne, Ivy, Omni Financial, and Citibank failed 
to plead or otherwise defend their claims and defaults were entered against 
them on August 6, 2012. In its July 5, 2013 motion, discussed below, OneWest 
moved for entry of default judgment against all the defaulted defendants. 
That part of the motion was granted in the circuit court’s June 3, 2014 
order. Nonetheless, Brown later filed memoranda in opposition to some of the 
post-judgment motions in this case.

decree of foreclosure. At an August 26, 2013 hearing on this 
motion,2 the circuit court found that OneWest’s delay in 
initiating the proceedings constituted laches and allowed it to 
collect only the remaining principal amount of the mortgage, two 
years interest at a rate of seven percent, and pre-acceleration 
late charges. It barred OneWest from collecting any additional 
interest, escrow advances and taxes, property preservation fees, 
property inspection fees, broker price opinion fees, or 
appraisal fees. The total amount it permitted OneWest to 
collect was $581,972.26. 
On June 3, 2014, the circuit court filed its findings 
of fact, conclusions of law, and order granting OneWest’s 
summary judgment motion. It directed that the summary judgment 
and interlocutory decree of foreclosure requested by OneWest be 
entered as a final judgment to OneWest’s complaint. It 
foreclosed on the mortgage and appointed a commissioner to take 
possession of the property and to sell it, and expressly 
“reserve[d] jurisdiction to determine the party or parties to 
whom any surplus shall be awarded.” The court’s order 
authorized OneWest and all other parties to purchase the 
property, requiring the successful bidder to make a down payment 
of no less than ten percent of the highest successful bid price,

but providing that OneWest could satisfy the down payment by way 
of offset up to the amount of its secured debt if it was the 
purchaser, and ordering that “[a]t the Court’s discretion, the 
ten percent (10%) down payment may be forfeited in full or in 
part if the purchaser fails to pay the balance of the purchase 
price as hereinafter set forth.” It provided further that “[i]n 
no event shall the purchaser be liable for damages greater than 
the forfeiture of the ten percent (10%) down payment.” The 
circuit court’s judgment was filed the same day. 
At the first public auction of the property, held on 
August 11, 2014, the property was sold to a couple, the only 
bidding party, for $50,000.00, subject to confirmation by the 
circuit court. OneWest filed a motion to re-open bidding, which 
the court granted on October 31, 2014. At the second auction, 
held on December 9, 2014, the property was sold to OneWest, the 
highest bidder, for $815,098.42, subject to confirmation by the 
circuit court. 
On January 12, 2015, OneWest filed a motion for an 
order confirming the foreclosure sale and directing conveyance. 
On March 6, 2015, the circuit court filed an order granting 
OneWest’s motion. The court approved the sale of the property 
to OneWest at the offered price of $815,098.42, and required 
that the closing date be within 35 days of the filing of its 
order—that is, on or before April 10, 2015. The court approved

payments from the sale in the following order: to the 
commissioner, to OneWest, to the Association, and to the escrow 
account for the closing of the sale, with any remainder to 
Brown. Pursuant to the order, final judgment was entered in 
favor of OneWest on March 27, 2015. 
However,
 OneWest refused to close the sale by the 
court-ordered date of April 10, 2015. OneWest’s failure to 
comply with the March 6, 2015 order led to the filing of two 
motions in May 2015. The first motion was the Association’s May 
12, 2015 “Motion for an Order to Show Cause and for Civil 
Contempt and for Other Relief[.]” The Association’s motion 
resulted in an order on July 24, 2015 holding OneWest liable for 
damages. The second motion was OneWest’s May 21, 2015 “Motion 
for an Order (1) Vacating Order Confirming the Foreclosure Sale 
Filed March 6, 2015; (2) Determining Deductions to Plaintiff’s 
Credit Bid Deposit; (3) Reopening Bid at Hearing on Motion; (4) 
Confirming Sale to Plaintiff at Adjusted Credit Bid Amount; (5) 
for Other HRCP Rule 60(b) Relief; Alternatively (6) Instructing 
Commissioner to Conduct a New Auction[.]” OneWest’s motion was 
ultimately denied on September 22, 2015 in an order that 
required OneWest to pay damages to the Association. The award 
of damages to the Association is at issue in this appeal.

    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
2. The Association’s Motion for an Order to Show Cause 
On May 12, 2015, the Association filed a motion for an 
order for OneWest to show cause why it had refused to comply 
with the court’s March 6, 2015 order and why it should not be 
held in civil contempt for its refusal. The Association also 
moved for an order that another public auction on the property 
be held and that OneWest be required to pay the commissioner the 
difference between its winning bid at the December 9, 2014 
auction and the winning bid obtained at the new auction. It 
also requested that OneWest pay the Association accrued fees and 
dues on the property, the Association’s attorneys’ fees and 
costs, post judgment interest on OneWest’s bid, all costs of the 
prior and requested future sale, and amounts paid to the 
commissioner as rental proceeds. In the alternative, it 
requested that specific compliance be enforced against OneWest. 
In its memorandum supporting the motion, the 
Association argued that if the court chose not to hold a new 
sale and determined that OneWest’s damages should be limited to 
$81,509.84 (because the court’s June 3, 2014 order required 
damages to be limited to the down payment amount of ten percent 
of the purchase price), the court should specifically enforce 
OneWest’s compliance with the sales contract and make OneWest 
pay the Association all the fees, costs, interest, and proceeds 
the Association was requesting.

             *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
On July 24, 2015, the circuit court filed its order 
granting in part and denying in part the Association’s motion. 
It denied the Association’s request for a third auction, 
required OneWest to pay the Association’s accrued monthly fees 
and dues, and held that OneWest was liable for $81,509.84 in 
damages, “with disposition of said amount subject to further 
order of the Court[.]” 
3. OneWest’s HRCP Rule 60(b) Motion 
On
 May 21, 2015, shortly after the Association filed 
its motion for an order to show cause, OneWest, pursuant to 
Hawaiʻi Rules of Civil Procedure (“HRCP”) Rule 60(b) (2006), 
moved for an order vacating the March 6, 2015 order confirming 
the foreclosure sale, determining deductions to its credit bid 
deposit, reopening bidding at the hearing on the motion, 
confirming the sale to OneWest at the adjusted credit bid 
amount, and for other relief, or, in the alternative, for 
instructions to the commissioner to hold a new auction. 
The
 crux of OneWest’s argument was that, at the time 
of its $815,098.42 bid, it mistakenly believed that when the 
court stated in its October 31, 2014 order re-opening bidding 
that OneWest would not be entitled to a deficiency judgment, it 
meant that OneWest would not have to pay excess proceeds to 
junior lienholders if it made a bid equal to the total amount of 
the debt. OneWest stated that if it had realized that the June 
8            
            
           
           
         
           
            
           
           
            
             
            
 
           
          
         
           
         
          
           
         
           
          
           
             *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
3, 2014 decree of foreclosure, which limited its recovery on the 
debt to $581,972.26, had “fixed” its credit bid at that amount, 
it would have bid $581,972.26, and still won the auction, rather 
than overbidding at $815,098.42. OneWest claimed that under 
this alternative scenario, where it made a bid equal to the 
total amount of the debt, it would not have had any surplus 
proceeds and would not have been required to pay the Association 
condominium dues and expenses that were not reduced to a final 
judgment. OneWest asked the court to hold a hearing to re-open 
the bidding and allow it to submit a reduced bid, and asked that 
the court limit its damages only to actual damages caused by its 
delay. 
On June 5, 2015, the Association filed its memorandum 
in opposition to OneWest’s HRCP Rule 60(b) motion. The 
Association argued that the orders recognizing its claims should 
not be disturbed and that ten percent of OneWest’s bid amount 
should be distributed to the Association as damages suffered 
from OneWest’s breach of its contract to buy the property. 
The Association’s argument that it was entitled to ten 
percent of OneWest’s bid amount (i.e., $81,509.84) was as 
follows. The court’s July 24, 2015 order on the Association’s 
motion held that OneWest was liable for $81,509.84 in damages 
because of its breach of the sales contract and that disposition 
of the damages would be subject to further order of the court.

        *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The Association had expectation damages of $116,011.95 that it 
would have received from the surplus sales proceeds if OneWest 
had closed at $815,098.42, plus additional costs and fees 
incurred as a result of OneWest’s default. Thus, the $81,509.84 
that OneWest was ordered to pay in damages should be paid 
towards the Association’s expectation damages. OneWest itself 
was not entitled to receipt of that amount because the default 
and all damages were solely its fault. 
At a hearing on the motion,3 the court made it clear 
that the sale was not going to close and that a new foreclosure 
action would be necessary, stating, “It’s not gonna close. It 
hasn’t closed within time period. The plaintiff’s gonna have to 
file a new foreclosure action. That’s what they’re gonna have 
to do.” 
On September 22, 2015, the circuit court filed its 
order denying OneWest’s May 21, 2015 motion. It held that the 
motion was not timely filed, so OneWest was not entitled to any 
relief under HRCP Rule 60. It held further that, even if the 
motion was considered timely filed, there was no basis for HRCP 
Rule 60 relief, and that OneWest had unclean hands due to delays 
in the case. It held that OneWest was liable for $81,509.84 in 
damages, and ordered that it pay $8.00 in escrow fees and

$81,501.84 to the Association “to be regarded as partial 
satisfaction of the Association’s damages and partial 
satisfaction of the Association’s lien on the Property.” 
On October 2, 2015, OneWest filed a motion for 
reconsideration of the circuit court’s September 22, 2015 order, 
which the court denied. OneWest appealed the March 6, 2015 
order confirming the foreclosure sale, the March 27, 2015 final 
judgment, and the February 12, 2016 order denying its motion for 
reconsideration to the Intermediate Court of Appeals (“ICA”). 
B. ICA Proceedings 
In its opening brief before the ICA, OneWest 
identified four points of error, only one of which was 
ultimately decided in its favor. That point of error concerned 
the circuit court’s jurisdiction to assess damages against 
OneWest and award them to the Association: 
The circuit court erred in denying [OneWest’s] motion for 
reconsideration, and relatedly its motion to vacate, 
because the circuit court lacked subject matter 
jurisdiction to award the [Association] damages since the 
[Association] never filed any affirmative pleading 
sufficient to be awarded damages, and, alternatively, the 
[Association] presented no evidence of any damages caused 
by non-completion of the foreclosure sale. 
The ICA held that OneWest’s argument that the circuit 
court erred in entering damages awards against OneWest in the 
September 22, 2015 order denying HRCP Rule 60(b) relief had 
merit. OneWest Bank, F.S.B. v. Brown, No. CAAP-16-0000123, 2018 
WL 2433688, at *5 (App. May 30, 2018) (SDO). The ICA noted that 
11            
  
 In  this  case,  the  issue  of  OneWest  Bank’s  potential  
liability  for  damages  was  before  the  Circuit  Court  in  
conjunction  with  the  Association’s  post-judgment  motion  
that  resulted  in  the  July  24,  2015  Order  on  Motion  to  Show  
Cause,  which  is  not  before  the  court  on  this  appeal.   
However,  the  issue  of  the  amount  of  damages  incurred  by  the 
Association  was  not  properly  before  the  Circuit  Court  in  
conjunction  with  OneWest  Bank’s  post-judgment  motion  for  
HRCP  Rule  60(b)  relief  from  the  Judgment  on  Foreclosure  
Decree  and  the  Judgment  on  Confirmation  Order,  as  there  
were  no  damages  awarded  against  OneWest  in  those  judgments, 
or  their  respective  underlying  orders.   OneWest  Bank’s  
motion  sought  to  limit  the  amount  forfeited  from  its  credit 
bid  deposit.   Thus,  we  conclude  that  the  Circuit  Court  
erred  in  the  Order  Denying  the  Rule  60(b)  Motion,  in  
finding  that  OneWest  Bank  is  liable  for  payment  of  damages  
to  the  Association,  and  that  the  Association  has  incurred  
damages  in  a  certain  amount,  and  ordering  OneWest  Bank  to  
pay  damages  to  the  Association.

The ICA stated that its ruling “should not be construed as a 
ruling on the merits of an award of damages against OneWest Bank 
and is without prejudice to any relief granted in conjunction 
with the Order on Motion to Show Cause or any other such 
proceedings.” Id. at *5 n.5. 
The ICA affirmed in part and reversed in part the 
September 22, 2015 order denying OneWest’s HRCP Rule 60(b) 
motion, affirming the entire order except for the three 
paragraphs relating to damages that it struck. Id. at *7. 
C. Supreme Court Proceedings 
The Association filed an application for writ of 
certiorari with this court, requesting that we reverse the 
(. . . continued) 
that it be required to forfeit only $12,130.80 of its 10% credit bid amount 
of $81,509.84 , is denied.” The ICA removed this part of the SDO after the 
Association moved for reconsideration, and issued an amended SDO that did not 
strike paragraph 7 of the order.

portions of the ICA’s opinion that struck paragraphs e, g, and 9 
from the September 22, 2015 order. It presented the following 
two questions in its application: 
A. Whether the ICA gravely erred in holding that the 
Circuit Court improperly decided the issues of the amount 
of damages incurred by the Association and OneWest Bank’s 
liability for said damages where OneWest Bank’s Motion 
specifically raised and asked the Circuit Court to decide 
these issues. 
B. Whether the ICA gravely erred in holding that the 
Circuit Court could not decide issues in the September 22, 
2015 Order that were not previously addressed in the prior 
Judgment on Foreclosure Decree and Judgment on Confirmation 
Order. 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW 
“An appellate court reviews a circuit court’s 
determination of an HRCP Rule 60 motion for an abuse of 
discretion.” Buscher v. Boning, 114 Hawaiʻi  202, 2 11, 159 P.3d 
814, 823 (2007) (quoting Amantiad v.
 Odum, 90 Hawaiʻi  152, 158,  
977 P.2d 160, 166 (1999)). “An abuse of discretion occurs where 
the trial court has clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or 
disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the 
substantial detriment of a party litigant.” Id. (brackets

Hawaiʻi 338, 351, 133 P.3d 767, 780 (2006)). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
The first question we consider is whether the ICA 
erred when it held that the issue of OneWest’s liability for 
14            
           
            
             
          
          
             
           
          
          
           
        
          
     
              
          
          
 
           
            
           
           
          
         
           
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
damages was not properly before the circuit court in conjunction 
with OneWest’s May 21, 2015 motion for HRCP Rule 60(b) relief. 
We conclude that the ICA did err in this regard. Having so 
concluded, we next consider whether the circuit court abused its 
discretion by finding OneWest liable to the Association in the 
amount of $81,501.94. We conclude that this was an abuse of its 
discretion, and that the amount should have been applied as a 
reduction to Brown’s debt to OneWest, the mortgagee, rather than 
awarded as damages to the Association, a junior lienholder. 
Therefore, we affirm in part and vacate in part the ICA’s 
judgment striking the damages paragraphs from the circuit 
court’s September 22, 2015 order on OneWest’s motion for HRCP 
Rule 60(b) relief. 
A. The ICA erred in holding that the issue of damages was not 
properly before the circuit court when the circuit court issued 
its September 22, 2015 order on OneWest’s HRCP Rule 60(b) 
motion. 
The first of the two post-judgment orders the circuit 
court filed was its July 24, 2015 order granting in part and 
denying in part the Association’s motion for an order to show 
cause, for civil contempt against OneWest, and for other relief. 
That order denied most of the Association’s requests, but did 
order that OneWest pay the Association $11,791.12 in accrued 
monthly fees and dues and held that OneWest was “liable for 
$81,509.84 or ten percent (10%) of its bid price of $815,098.42 
15            
           
       
          
           
          
         
           
           
         
             
          
            
           
           
             
            
            
         
           
           
          
           
          
            *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
as damages, with disposition of said amount subject to further 
order of the Court[.]” (Emphasis added.) 
The circuit court was acting within its discretion 
when it held OneWest liable for its failure to close the 
foreclosure sale by the court-ordered deadline. The June 3, 
2014 foreclosure order required the successful bidder at the 
foreclosure sale to “make a down payment to the Commissioner in 
an amount not less than ten percent (10%) of the highest 
successful bid price,” providing that OneWest could satisfy the 
down payment by way of offset up to the amount of its secured 
debt, and ordered that “[a]t the Court’s discretion, the ten 
percent (10%) down payment may be forfeited in full or in part 
if the purchaser fails to pay the balance of the purchase 
price[.]” OneWest was the highest bidder at the second auction 
of the property on December 9, 2014 with a bid of $815,098.42. 
The March 6, 2015 order confirming sale ordered the sale of the 
property to OneWest at its offered price of $815,098.42. And in 
the order on the Association’s post-judgment motion, the circuit 
court found that OneWest had refused to complete the sale and 
was “a defaulting purchaser in breach of the sales contract and 
. . . liable for damages arising from its default.” 
In judicial sales, “[t]he confirmation of sale is the 
equivalent of a valid contract of sale[,]” and the “application 
of contract law is appropriate[.]” First Tr. Co. of Hilo v. 
16            
             
         
            
              
         
         
            
           
            
     
  Following  the  filing  of  the  order  on  the  Association’s 
show  cause  motion,  the  circuit  court  filed  its  order  denying  
OneWest’s  HRCP  Rule  60(b)  motion  on  September  22,  2015.   That  
second  post-judgment  order  included  a  finding  of  fact  that  
OneWest  was  “liable  for  payment  of  $81,509.84  in  damages[.]”   
Presumably,  this  finding  was  based  on  the  circuit  court’s  prior  
order,  which  imposed  the  liability  on  OneWest.   Further  finding  
that  “[t]he  Association  has  incurred  damages  of  $116,011.95  due  
to  Plaintiff’s  failure  to  complete  the  sale  of  the  property  
foreclosed  upon  in  this  action[,]”  the  circuit  court  then  
ordered  that  OneWest  “shall  pay  to  the  Association  forthwith  the 
sum  of  $81,501.84  for  damages  suffered  by  the  Association  and  
said  amount  shall  be  regarded  as  partial  satisfaction  of  the   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Reinhardt, 3 Haw. App. 589, 592, 655 P.2d 891, 893 (1982). 
Here, OneWest breached the confirmation of sale “contract” by 
refusing to complete the sale. It is “a basic precept of 
contract law . . . that a party who sustains a loss by the 
breach of another is entitled to compensation that will 
‘actually or as precisely as possible compensate the injured 
party.’” Hi Kai Inv., Ltd. v. Aloha Futons Beds & Waterbeds, 
Inc.
, 84 Hawaiʻi 75, 80-81, 929 P.2d 88, 93-94 (1996) (quoting 
Amfac
 v. Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co., 74 Haw. 85, 128, 839 P.2d 
10, 32 (1992)). 
17            
  
  Contrary  to  the  ICA’s  holding,  the  issue  of  damages  
was  “properly  before  the  Circuit  Court  in  conjunction  with  
OneWest  Bank’s  post-judgment  motion  for  HRCP  Rule  60(b)  
relief[,]”  OneWest,  2018  WL  2433688,  at  *5,  because  its  order  on 
the  Association’s  show  cause  motion  was  written  explicitly  to  
allow  for  “disposition  of  said  amount  subject  to  further  order  
of  the  Court.”   In  other  words,  the  further  disposition  of  the  
amount  discussed  in  the  court’s  order  on  the  Association’s  
motion  was  included  in  its  order  on  OneWest’s  motion.     
            
            
           
           
            
          
            
              
          
            
          
         
        *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Association’s  damages  and  partial  satisfaction  of  the
Association’s  lien  on  the  Property.”   
It was not an abuse of the circuit court’s discretion 
for it to delay the order specifying the party to whom the 
damages would be paid. In a judicial foreclosure action, the 
circuit court has broad discretion to order execution on its own 
judgments. See HRS § 667-1.5 (2016). And the circuit courts 
generally have discretion in civil actions to make such orders 
“as may be necessary to carry into full effect the powers which 
are or shall be given to them by law or for the promotion of 
justice in matters pending before them.” HRS § 603-21.9(6) 
(2016); see Timothy
, 96 Hawaiʻi at 357, 31 P.3d at 214 (holding 
that “the circuit court in this case was statutorily authorized, 
in aid of its original jurisdiction over mortgage foreclosure 
actions, to enter appropriate orders against [the purchaser] 
18
            
           
       
  It  was  a  reasonable  exercise  of  the  circuit  court’s  
discretion  for  it  to  delay  the  award  of  damages  until  after  it  
had  ruled  on  OneWest’s  motion,  the  outcome  of  which  might  have  
affected  who  was  entitled  to  damages.   There  was  nothing  
requiring  the  circuit  court  to  issue  a  separate  order  deciding  
which  party  should  receive  the  damages.   In  fact,  OneWest,  
apparently  recognizing  that  denial  of  its  request  for  HRCP  Rule  
60(b)  relief  would  have  left  it  liable  for  damages  for  breach  of
the  foreclosure  sale  contract,  made  arguments  about  the  issue  of
its  liability  in  its  post-judgment  motion.   It  is  true  that  “[a]
Rule  60(b)  motion  for  reconsideration  is  not  a  vehicle  for  
introducing  entirely  new  claims  into  an  action.”   Stoller  v.  
Marsh,  682  F.2d  971,  981  (D.C.  Cir.  1982)  (referring  to  the  
corresponding  federal  rule).   But  in  this  case,  the  damages  
issue  was  not  new;  the  circuit  court  created  the  condition  that  
led  to  liability  for  damages  when  it  set  the  terms  of  the  sale,  
and  OneWest  set  in  motion  the  liability  analysis  when  it  failed  
to  close  the  court-ordered  sale.   
 
 
 
  Although
  it  was  within  the  circuit  court’s  discretion
to  award  damages  in  its  September  22,  2015  order  on  OneWest’s   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
after he defaulted on his agreement to purchase the mortgaged 
property at the foreclosure sale”). 
 
 
 
B.   It  was   abuse  of  discretion  for  the  circuit  court  to  award
damages  to  the  Association.   
 
19            
            
 
  It  is  a  general  principle  of  mortgage  law  that  “[t]he  
mortgagee  with  first  lien  priority  is  entitled  to  recover  the  
mortgage  and  all  associated  costs  and  fees  according  to  the  
terms  of  the  mortgage  agreement,  from  the  proceeds  of  the  
foreclosure  sale  before  the  mortgagee  with  second  lien  priority  
could  recover  its  mortgage,  fees,  and  associated  costs[.]”   55  
Am.  Jur.  2d  Mortgages  §  705  (2019).   To  that  end,  the  Hawaiʻi  
statute  controlling  the  distribution  of  proceeds  in  judicial  
foreclosure  sales  provides  that  “[m]ortgage  and  other  creditors  
shall  be  entitled  to  payment  according  to  the  priority  of  their  
liens[.]”   HRS  §  667-3.   This  statute  prevents  the  circuit  court  
from  distributing  the  proceeds  of  a  foreclosure  sale  to  a  junior  
lienholder,  rather  than  the  foreclosing  mortgagee,  before  the  
first  lien  is  fully  satisfied.   Fujii  v.  Osborne,  67  Haw.  322,  
323,  687  P.2d  1333,  1335  (1984)  (“Under  HRS  §  667–3,  a  circuit  
court  lacks  power  to  terminate  a  valid  and  subsisting  first  
mortgage  lien  in  a  foreclosure  action  and  order  the  proceeds  of  
a  foreclosure  sale  paid  to  the  second  mortgagee,  rather  than  the  
first,  without  the  consent  of  the  first  mortgagee.”)   By  its  
plain  language,  HRS  §  667-3  applies  to  the  down  payment  ordered  
by  the  circuit  court  in  this  case.   Thus,  the  circuit  court  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
HRCP Rule 60(b) motion, we hold further that its decision to 
award  those  damages  to  the  Association  was  an  abuse  of  its
discretion.   
20            
           
        
         
            
         
      
            
             
          
             
         
         
         
           
            
         
          
         
          
           
            
          
              
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
violated HRS § 667-3 by allowing the Association, a junior 
lienholder, to recover the down payment as damages. 
Although this case involved the judicial foreclosure 
process, governed by Part I of HRS Chapter 667, our holding is 
consistent with the more recently enacted and more detailed 
statutory provisions regarding the nonjudicial foreclosure 
process, governed by Part II. See Timothy
, 96 Hawaiʻi at 356 
n.8, 31 P.3d at 213 n.8 (noting that Part II “establishes a much 
more detailed process for foreclosing upon a mortgage than part 
I”); Lee
 v. HSBC Bank USA
, 121 Hawaiʻi 287, 292 n.4, 218 P.3d 
775, 780 n.4 (2009) (“The legislative history behind this 
alternative process gives some insight into the purposes behind 
HRS section 667-5.”); Kondaur
 Capital Corp. v. Matsuyoshi
, 136 
Hawaiʻi 227, 238, 361 P.3d 454, 465 (2015) (citing a presumption 
in a section in Part II as evidence that the legislature could 
have fashioned a similar presumption for judicial foreclosures). 
Part II expressly provides that “the successful bidder at the 
public sale, as the purchaser, shall make a nonrefundable 
downpayment to
 the foreclosing mortgagee of not less than ten 
per cent of the highest successful bid price[,]” and that “[i]f 
the successful bidder is the foreclosing mortgagee . . . , the 
downpayment requirement may be satisfied by offset and a credit 
bid up to the amount of the mortgage debt.” HRS § 667-29 (2016) 
(emphasis added). It further provides that the down payment of 
21            
          
      
 If  the  successful  bidder  later  fails  to  comply  with  
the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  public  sale  or  fails  to  
complete  the  purchase  within  forty-five  days  after  the  
public  sale  is  held,  the  downpayment  shall  be  forfeited  by  
that  bidder.   The  forfeited  downpayment  shall  be  credited  
by  the  foreclosing  mortgagee  first  towards  the  foreclosing  
mortgagee’s  attorney’s  fees  and  costs,  then  towards  the  
fees  and  costs  of  the  power  of  sale  foreclosure,  and  any  
balance  towards  the  moneys  owed  to  the  foreclosing  
mortgagee.   The  foreclosing  mortgagee,  in  its  discretion,  
may  then  accept  the  bid  of  the  next  highest  bidder  who  
meets  the  requirements  of  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  
public  sale  or  may  begin  the  public  sale  process  again.  
 
      
  In   its  memorandum  in  opposition  to  OneWest’s  HRCP  Rule 
60(b)  motion,  the  Association  cited  Timothy  in  support  of  its  
argument  that  it  should  receive  distribution  of  the  down  payment 
for  damages  suffered.   In  that  case,  the  Association  noted,  the  
ICA  approved  of  the  circuit  court  awarding  First  Hawaiian  Bank  
(“FHB”)  benefit  of  the  bargain  damages  even  though  FHB  was  not  a 
party  to  the  sales  contract  because  the  property  was  sold  to  a  
third-party  bidder.   See  Timothy,  96  Hawaiʻi  at  363,  31  P.3d  at  
220.   But  FHB  was  the  foreclosing  mortgagee  in  Timothy,  id.  at  
351,  31  P.3d  at  208,  and  was  entitled  to  damages  resulting  from  
a  breach  of  the  foreclosure  sale  contract  by  the  third-party  
purchaser.   In  fact,  in  Timothy,  the  third-party  purchaser  
forfeited  and  FHB  received  the  down  payment  when  the  purchaser  
failed  to  close  the  sale.   Id.   Furthermore,  the  ICA  also  
concluded  that,  while  FHB  was  entitled  to  damages  in  excess  of

   IV. CONCLUSION

the forfeited down payment for fees and costs attributable to 
the failure to close the sale, “the circuit court improperly 
awarded damages [(i.e., per diem interest, etc.)] to FHB based 
on [the mortgagor’s] underlying loan obligation to FHB to which 
[the third-party purchaser] was not a party.” Id. at 363, 31 
P.3d at 220. Likewise in the present case, while it would be 
appropriate for OneWest to “recover” the forfeited down payment 
by applying the amount to reduce Brown’s debt as a penalty for 
its failure to close the sale, it would not be appropriate to 
award the forfeited down payment as damages to the Association 
based on Brown’s underlying obligations to the Association to 
which  OneWest  was   not  a  party,  particularly  when  OneWest  is  the 
senior  lienholder.    5 
In the ICA’s judgment
 on appeal, it struck paragraphs 
e, g, and 9 from the circuit court’s September 22, 2015 order on 
OneWest’s motion for HRCP Rule 60(b) relief. Although we hold 
that the ICA erred in striking those paragraphs for the reasons 
stated in its amended summary disposition order, we find that 
the circuit court’s award of the forfeited down payment as 
5 Our holding does not affect the Association’s ability to recover, 
in whole or in part, on its lien of $116,011.95 if a sufficient price for the 
mortgaged property is obtained at a subsequent foreclosure auction, nor does 
it invalidate the sanctions imposed for OneWest’s lack of diligence in the 
circuit court’s July 24, 2015 order.

  For  the  foregoing  reasons,  we  affirm  in  part  and  
vacate  in  part  the  ICA’s  June  22,  2018  Amended  Summary  
Disposition  Order  and  September  11,  2018  Judgment  on  Appeal,  and 
remand  the  case  to  the  Circuit  Court  of  the  Third  Circuit  for  
further  proceedings  consistent  with  this  opinion.

damages to the Association was an abuse of its discretion. 
Thus, only paragraph 9 of the circuit court’s September 22, 2015 
order should have been stricken, and the case should have been 
remanded to the circuit court for proper disposition of the down 
payment amount.
