 2 Circuit Court of the Third Circuit (“ circuit court ”)1 (1) 
improperly precluded evidence and (2) improperly denied her 
Motion to Amend Complaint solely on the basis of undue delay .  
We hold that the ICA did not err  when it held that the 
circuit court was within its discretion to exclude evidence 
related to an unpleaded claim .  To resolve  the second issue 
before this court , we must consider whether, under Hawaiʻi Rules 
of Civil Procedure (“HRCP”)  Rule 15(a), undue delay alone is a 
sufficient basis to deny leave to  amend a complaint .  Consistent 
with the requirement of Rule 15(a) that leave be freely given to 
requests to amend a complaint, we hold that undue dela y alone is 
an insufficient basis to deny leave to amend a complaint under 
HRCP Rule 15(a).   
II. BACKGROUND  
 
On September 23, 2005, Royden Kalavi ( “Royden”) died 
as a passenger in an automobile accident.  The other car and 
driver involved in the accident were uninsured .  Carvalho 
contended that Royden was covered  by his maternal grandparents 
John and Barbara Carvalho ’s (“the Carvalhos ”) insurance policy .  
The Carvalhos purchased their insurance policy from  
Respondents/ Defendants -Appellees AIG Hawaiʻi Insurance Company, 
Inc. and Hawaiʻi Insurance Consultants, Ltd . (collectively “AIG”) .   
                                                 
 1  The Honorable Ronald Ibarra presided.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S H AWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 3 Carvalho was designated as the personal representative 
of Royden’s estate and made a claim for uninsured motorist ( “UM”) 
and underinsured  motorist ( “UIM”) benefits under the Carvalhos ’ 
AIG policy, stating that  Royden was covered  as a “resident  
relative .”  AIG told Carvalho that only non -stacked UM and UIM 
coverages totaling  $70,000 were available to Royden under the 
Carvalhos ’ AIG policy  and stated that it had not det ermined 
whether Royden was covered under the Carvalhos’ AIG policy as a 
“resident relative .”   
Carvalho filed a Complaint against AIG o n December 31, 
2007 with the circuit court seeking a declaratory judgment for 
increased and stacked UM  and UIM insurance coverage totaling 
$1.2 million under the  Carvalhos ’ AIG policy  arguing that AIG 
improperly failed to recognize that stacked UM and UIM coverages 
totaling $1.2 million were available to her .   
On March 11, 2008, AIG filed a motion requesting that  
the circui t court stay the case pending the resolution of  a 
separate declaratory judgment action filed by AIG .  AIG filed a 
separate action  against, inter alia , Carvalho, the Carvalhos, 
Royden’s father (“ Kalavi”), and any other identified parties to 
determine  who, including Royden, was covered under  the 
Carvalhos ’ AIG policy  and who was covered under  Kalavi’s AIG 
policy.  The circuit court granted the stay on April 15, 2008.    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S H AWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 4  The parties resolved  AIG’s declaratory judgment action 
by stipulated judgment  filed on  July 16, 2008 .  The parties 
stipulated that Royden was covered as a resident “family member” 
under the Carvalhos ’ AIG policy but not  under Kalavi ’s AIG 
policy.  Following the stipulated judgment , the parties 
submitted to private UM/UIM  arbitration to resolve t he value of 
the loss sustained by  Royden’s estate, Carvalho , and Kalavi  as 
provided under the Carvalho s’ AIG policy if the parties did  not 
agree on “the amount of damages .”  The case was continued 
pending a resolution by arbitration per the stipulation of the 
parties.  On April 2, 2009, an arbitration award totaling $3 
million2 in damages was issued, with $500,000 awarded to Royden’s 
estate, $1.25 million to Carvalho, and $1.25 million to Kalavi.  
On April 29, 2009, AIG transmitted two checks to Carvalho 
totaling $1.2 million as payment under the Carvalhos’ combined 
UM and UIM policy limits.   
Following the arbitration award , the case remained 
dormant for multiple  years3 until November 1, 2013 , when the 
circuit court filed a Notice of Status Hearing.  On June 25, 
2014, Plaintiff Carvalho filed a  Notice of Trial Setting Status 
                                                 
2  The $3 million damage award included no deductions for any other 
insurance.   
 
3  As the ICA noted, the reason why the case remained dormant is 
unclear from the record.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S H AWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 5 Conference,  and the circuit court set a trial  date of January 12, 
2016, and set all pretrial deadlines,  including a discovery cut -
off date of November 13, 2015.    
AIG sought to preclude “ any and all evidence and  
argument from being presented to the jury at the time of trial 
in furtherance of [Carvalho ’s] unpled claim that [AIG]  somehow 
breached a duty to settle the underlying UM and UIM claim  . . . 
prior to the issuance of the UM/UIM Arbit ration Award ” on June 
12, 2015 .4  AIG asserted that Carvalho did not make a bad faith  
claim in her initial Complaint  and that such allegations were 
time-barred because seven years since the filing of Carvalho’s 
original Complaint and five years since the U M/UIM arbitration 
had passed.  On August 12, 2015, the circuit court orally 
granted AIG ’s Motion to Preclude Evidence .  
On August 10, 2015, Plaintiff Carvalho filed a Motion 
to Amend Complaint.  Carvalho’s motion did not include further 
causes of action  but included significant additional factual 
allegations  and assertions that AIG “deliberately,  deceptively, 
unfairly, and/or in bad faith unreasonably delayed  their payment 
of $1.2 million in UM and UIM benefits to  [Carvalho] from at 
                                                 
4  The ICA stated that “AIG’s motion was apparently brought in 
response to  a settlement conference statement filed by Carvalho on February 6, 
2015, and a discovery request on or around June 8, 2015, which made reference 
to what AIG characterized as a previously unpled claim that AIG had acted in 
bad faith for its failure to tend er the policy limits to Plaintiff Carvalho 
prior to the UM/UIM arbitration award.”  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S H AWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 6 least on or about April 16, 2007  until after the April 2, 2009 
Arbitration Award was issued[.] ”  The circuit court denied 
Carvalho’s Motion to Amend Complaint due to “undue delay.”5  
Relevant to this appeal, b efore the ICA, Carvalho  
asserted that  the circuit court erred when it :  (1) granted 
AIG’s Motion to Preclude Evidence and (2) when it denied 
Carvalho’s Motion to Amend Complaint .  The ICA affirmed  the 
circuit court’s  Order Precluding Evidence  and Order Denying 
Motion to Amend Complaint.   The ICA agreed with Carvalho that 
AIG’s Motion to Preclude Evidence was a motion in limine, but 
held that that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion 
when it granted AIG’s Motion to Preclude Evidence  “because it 
appropriately prohibited Plaintiff  Carvalho from introducing 
evidence not related to her Complaint. ”  The ICA also held that 
the circuit court did not abuse its discretion when it denied 
Carvalho’s Motion to Amend Complaint because Carvalho “had 
waited multiple years to request leave to amend her Complaint,  
                                                 
5  Carvalho also filed  “Plaintiff ’s Motion for Reconsideration, 
and/or clarification,  and in the alternative, for leave to file an 
interlocutory appeal  pursuant to HRS § 6 41-1(b) (2011), of the Order Denying 
Plaintiffs ’ Motion to Amend Complaint ” (“Motion for Reconsideration ”).  The 
circuit court denied the Motion for Reconsideration because “ 1) there is no 
new matter or evidence that could not have been presented to Judge  Melvin 
Fujio and 2) as an alternative, the petition was filed beyond the 30 day 
period required to file an interlocutory appeal [.]”  The ICA affirmed the 
circuit court’s Order Denying Reconsideration.  The Motion for 
Reconsideration is not before this cour t and will not be addressed in this 
opinion.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S H AWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 7 and her motion was ba sed on information that she had access to  
since 2008 [.]”  
III.  STANDARDS  OF REVIEW  
 
A. Motion to Preclude Evidence /Motion in Limine  
The granting or denying of a motion in limine is reviewed 
for abuse of discretion.  The denial of a motion in limine, in 
itself, is not reversible error.  The harm, if any, occurs when 
the evidence is improperly admitted at trial.  Thus, even if the 
trial court abused its discretion in denying a party ’s motion, 
the real test is not in the disposition of the motion but the 
admission of evidence at trial.   
 
Kobashigawa v. Silva , 129 Hawaiʻi 313, 320, 300 P.3d 579, 586 
(2013) (citing State v. Eid , 126 Hawaiʻi 430, 440, 272 P.3d 1197, 
1207 (2012) (quoting Miyamoto v. Lum , 104 Hawaiʻi 1, 7, 84 P.3d 
509, 515 (2004) (internal quotation marks,  citations, and 
ellipsis omitted)) ).  
“An abuse of discretion occurs where the trial court 
has clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules 
or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of 
a party litigant.”  Hart v. Ticor Tit le Ins. Co. , 126 Hawaiʻi 448, 
455, 272 P.3d 1215, 1222 (2012) (quoting Allstate Ins. Co. v. 
Pruett, 118 Hawaiʻi 174, 179, 186 P.3d 609, 614 (2008)).  
B. Motion to Amend Complaint  
“This court reviews a denial of leave to amend a  
complaint under HRCP Rule 15(a) or (b) under the abuse  of 
discretion standard. ”  Kamaka v. Goodsill Anderson Quinn &  
Stifel, 117 Hawaiʻi 92, 104, 176 P.3d 91, 103 (2008) (citations  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S H AWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 8  omitted).  See also  Seki ex rel. Louie v. Hawaiʻi Gov’t Emps. 
Ass’n, AFSCME Local No. 152, AFL -CIO, 133 Hawaiʻi 385, 400, 328  
P.3d 394, 409 (2014 ).  The trial court abuses its discretion if 
its ruling is based  on an erroneous view of the law or on a 
clearly erroneous  assessment of the evidence.   The operative 
question is whether the trial court has clearly exceeded  the 
bounds of rea son or disregarded rules or principles of  law or 
practice to the substantial detriment of a party  litigant.   
Kamaka, 117 Hawaiʻi at 104, 176 P.3d at 103.  
IV. DISCUSSION  
 
Carvalho  raises two primary  issues before this court :  
(1) whether the circuit court properly precluded evidence 
related to an unpleaded  claim and (2) whether the circuit court 
properly denied Carvalho’s Motion to Am end Complaint solely on 
the basis of undue delay .  As discussed below, the ICA did not 
err when it held that the circuit court was within its 
discretion to grant AIG’s Motion to Preclude Evidence .  However, 
the ICA did err when it held that the circuit cou rt did not 
abuse its discretion when it denied Carvalho’s Motion to Amend 
Complaint  solely on the basis of undue delay .  We now hold that 
undue delay alone is an insufficient basis for denying leave to  
amend a complaint.  
A. The ICA did not err when it upheld the circuit court’s 
grant of  AIG’s Motion to Preclude Evidence .  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S H AWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 9 Carvalho does not appeal the ICA’s conclusion that 
AIG’s Motion to Preclude Evidence is a motion in limine.  Thus, 
the issue before this court  is whether the circuit court 
properly excluded evidence.  A motion in limine is “ a procedural 
device which requests a pretrial order  enjoining opposing 
counsel from using certain prejudicial  evidence in front of a 
jury at a later trial. ”  See Kobashigawa , 129 Hawaiʻi at 321, 300 
P.3d at 587.   We have held that  a circuit court may properly 
deny a motion in limine where the motion is “akin to a motion 
for summary judgment or other dispositive motion.”   O’Grady v. 
State, 140 Hawaiʻi 36, 53 n.16, 398 P.3d 625, 642 n.16 (2017); 
see also  Kuroda v. Kuroda , 87 Hawaiʻi 419, 427, 958 P.2d 541, 549 
(App. 1998) (stating that “a motion in limine is not an  
authorized method for presenting issues involving genuine issues  
of fact (in contrast to stipulated facts, questions of law, a nd 
matters of discretion) to the court for decision”) ; Kawakami v. 
Kahala Hotel Investors, LLC , 142 Hawaiʻi 507, 521-22, 421 P.3d  
1277, 1291-92 (2018). 
Here, the claim made in Carvalho’s Complaint was that  
AIG had initially failed to  recognize the increase d stacked 
UM/UIM policy limits due to her  under the Carvalhos ’ AIG policy .  
AIG’s Motion to Preclude Evidence on the other hand was seeking 
to “preclude[e] any and all evidence and argument from being  
presented to the jury at the time of trial in furtheran ce of *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S H AWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 10 [Carvalho ’s] unpled claim that [AIG] somehow breached a  duty to 
settle the underlying UM and UIM claim . . . prior to the  
issuance of the UM/UIM Arbitration Award.”   Thus, the bad faith 
claim was not a part of Carvalho’s Complaint and not before the 
court.  Consequently,  the circuit court properly excluded “any 
and all evidence and argument from being  presented to the jury 
at the time of trial in furtherance of  [Carvalho ’s] unpled claim 
that [AIG] somehow breached a  duty to settle the underlying UM 
and UIM claim . . . prior to the  issuance of the UM/UIM 
Arbitration Award” because it was not relevant to the issue of 
whether AIG had initially failed to  recognize the increased 
stacked UM/UIM policy limits due  to her under the Carvalhos ’ AIG 
policy.  As the ICA noted, at the time of the Motion to Preclude 
Evidence, Carvalho had not filed her Motion to Amend Complaint 
which included her bad faith claim .  When the circuit court 
granted the Motion to Preclude Evidence, only Carvalho’s claim s 
in her Complaint w ere at issue.   Thus, the circuit court did not 
abuse its discretion when it granted AIG’s Motion to Preclude 
Evidence.   
B. The ICA erred when it held that the circuit court did not 
abuse its discretion when it denied Carvalho’s Motion to 
Amend Complaint . 
 
Carvalho’s second point of error that the circuit 
court erred in denying her Motion to Amend Complaint, is *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S H AWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 11 governed by HRCP Rule 15(a) (2).6  HRCP Rule 15(a) provides that  
prior to trial, “leave shall be freely given when justice so 
requires” :  
(a) Amendments before trial.   
. . . . 
(2) OTHER AMENDMENTS.  In all other cases, a party may amend the 
party’s pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of 
the adverse party; and leave shall be freely given when justice 
so requires.  A motion or stipulation t o amend a pleading shall 
be accompanied by the proposed amended pleading in Ramseyer 
formatting (additions underscored and deletions bracketed and 
stricken).  A party filing or moving to file an amended pleading 
shall reproduce the entire pleading as propo sed and shall not 
incorporate any part of the prior pleading by reference, except 
with leave of court.  If granted or allowed, the amended pleading 
shall be filed, with Ramseyer formatting removed, and served 
forthwith.  
HRCP Rule 15(a)(2).  This court has  held that  “unless there is  
an apparent reason indicating otherwise, under HRCP Rule 15(a),  
leave to amend shall be freely given to a party to amend its  
complaint when justice so requires. ”  Dejetley v. Kaho‘ohalahala , 
122 Hawaiʻi 251, 269, 226 P.3d 421, 4 39 (2010) (citation and  
internal quotation marks omitted).   We have further explained :   
In the absence of any apparent or declared reason —such as 
undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the 
movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by  amendments 
previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by 
virtue of allowance of the amendment, futility of amendment, 
etc.—the leave sought should, as the rules requires, be “freely 
given.” 
 
                                                 
6  Carvalho contends in the alternative that HRCP Rule 15(b)(1) 
applies to her Motion to Amend, which governs “issues tried by consent” for 
amendments during and after trial.  Carvalho’s reliance on Rule 15(b)(1 ) is 
misplaced as her Motion to Amend was filed prior to trial and therefore HRCP 
Rule 15(a), which governs amendments made before trial, applies.  See HRCP 
Rule 15(a).   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S H AWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 12 Gonsalves v. Nissan Motor Corp. in Hawaiʻi, 100 Hawaiʻi 149, 160, 
58 P.3d 1196, 1207 (2002) ; see also  Kamaka, 117 Hawaiʻi at 112, 
176 P.3d at 111  (affirming an order denying a motion  to amend 
complaint because the trial court had justifiabl e reasons for 
denying the motion);  Hirasa v. Burtner , 68 Haw. 22, 26, 702 P.2d 
772, 775 (1985);  Bishop Trust Co.  v. Kamokila Dev. Corp. , 57 Haw. 
330, 337,  555 P.2d 1193, 1198 (1976) (quoting Foman v. Davis , 
371 U.S. 178,  182 (1962)).  
In its opinion, the ICA noted that “[u] pon review of 
the record and arg uments of the parties,  it appears that 
reasonable minds could differ as to whether  Plaintiff Carvalho 
was entitled to amend her complaint pursuant  to HRCP Rule 15(a) ”:  
On one hand, the motion was file d approximately three 
months prior to the discovery cut -off date and five months prior 
to trial, which was by no means prompt, bu t not as late into the 
court deadlines as other cases where our  appellate courts have 
determined undue delay provided justifiable  reason to deny a 
request to amend a complaint or answ er.   
 
Ultimately, the ICA concluded that the circuit court did not 
abuse its discretion in denying Carvalho’s Motion to Amend 
Complaint because it had “justifiable reasons,” namely undue 
delay:  
Here, Plaintiff Carvalho’s motion to amend was filed 
approximately seven and a half years after her Complaint had been 
filed, more than six years after the UM/UIM Arbitration award was 
issued and the stay in this case had expired, and almost one and 
a half years after she had filed her pretrial statement, which 
made no reference or mention of the previously unpled allegations.  
Also, Plaintiff Carvalho has stated, both to the circuit court 
and now on appeal, that the additional factual allegations 
alleged in her proposed First Amended Complaint were based on the 
claim handling conduct documented in AIG’s claim file documents 
that AIG had produced in discovery on May 1, 2008, and *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S H AWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 13 correspondence between her counsel and AIG’s counsel.  This 
indicates that Plaintiff Carvalho was aware of the circumstances 
pertaining to h er proposed amended complaint as early as 2008, 
and yet chose not to request leave to amend her Complaint until 
multiple years after the arbitration award was issued and the 
stay in this case had expired.  
 
The ICA erred in its  conclusion  that undue delay al one 
was a sufficient basis to deny the  Motion to Amend Complaint 
brought pursuant to  HRCP Rule 15(a) .  As this court has held, 
HRCP Rule 15(a) is “functionally identical” to Rule 15(a) of the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (“FRCP”) and “[w]here a Hawai‘i 
rule of civil procedure is identical to the federal rule, the 
interpretation of this rule by federal courts is highly 
persuasive.”  Dejetley , 122 Hawaiʻi at 270, 226 P.3d at 440 
(quoting Fed. Home Loan Mortg. Corp  v. Transamerica Ins. Co. , 89 
Hawai‘i 157, 162 n.1, 969 P.2d 1275, 1280 n.1.  (1998)).  We agree 
with the Ninth Circuit  Court of Appeals that undue delay alone 
is an insufficient  basis for denyin g leave to amend a complaint 
under FRCP Rule 15(a).  See United States v. United Healthcare 
Ins. Co. , 848 F.3d 1161, 1184 (9th Cir. 2016) (holding that the 
district court erred when it denied leave to amend complaint 
based on undue delay alone when the rec ord did not support any 
additional ground s--such as prejudice or bad faith --that would 
justify the denial of leave to amend in combination with undue 
delay); Owens v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan, Inc. , 244 F.3d 708, 
712–13 (9th Cir. 2001).    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S H AWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

As applied in th is case, the circuit court relied 
solely on undue delay when it denied Carvalho’s Motion to Amend 
Complaint and did not provide support for any additional ground s 
such as prejudice or bad faith.  Thus, based on this record, 
under HRCP Rule 15(a), the circu it court should have granted 
Carvalho’s Motion to Amend Complaint.  
V. CONCLUSION  
 
 For the foregoing reasons, the ICA was correct to 
conclude that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion 
when it granted AIG’s Motion to Preclude Evidence.  However, the 
ICA incorrectly concluded that under HRCP Rule 15(a) , Carvalho 
could not amend her Complaint due to undue delay.  We reiterate 
that under HRCP Rule 15(a), leave to amend a complaint  shall be 
freely given and now also hold that undue delay alone is an 
insufficient basis for denying leave to amend a  complaint.  The 
ICA’s December 23, 2020 judgment on appeal is accordingly 
affirmed in part and vacated in part.  This case is remanded to 
the circuit court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
