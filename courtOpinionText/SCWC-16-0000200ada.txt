OPINION OF THE COURT BY WILSON, J. 
 
  Respondents/Plaintiffs- Appellees Carolyn and Jay Uyeda 
(“the Uyedas”) sought summary judgment and an injunction against 
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant Evan Schermer (“Schermer”) in the 
District Court of the Third Circuit (“district court”) based on 
the testimony and findings of fact in an earlier district court 
civil case in which they prevailed against Schermer .  The 
district court granted their motion for summary judgment and Electronically Filed

2 their petition for injunction .  The Intermediate Court of 
Appeals (“ICA”) affirmed with regard to Carolyn Uyeda and 
Schermer sought certiorari.   Petitioner Schermer  argues that the 
judicially noticed facts that formed the basis of the judgment 
and injunction against him were  improperly admitted  because the 
previous case had a lower burden of proof.  We granted his 
application for certiorari, and now vacate the judgments against 
him. 
I.  BACKGROUND 
A.  Settlement Agreement 
  On September 22, 2014, the Uyedas and Schermer entered 
into a Mutual Settlement and Release Agreement (“Settlement 
Agreement”) for the purpose of resolving all claims in a civil 
case numbered 3SS 14- 1-134K (“Case 134”) .  In the S ettlement 
Agreement, the Uyedas and Schermer agreed that neither party 
would directly or indirectly contact the  other or come within 
100 yards of the other for three years, and declared that all 
records of interactions  between Carolyn Uyeda and Evan Schermer  
had been destroyed or relinquished.  In paragraph 7 of the 
Settlement Agreement, the parties agreed that breach of the 
agreement could result in an action for permanent injunction:  
 7.  Should any Party violate the terms of this 
agreement, the no n-breaching Party(ies) shall have the 
right to file an action for a permanent injunction against 
harassment against the other Party(ies) in the District 
Court of the Third Circuit, North and South Kona Division, 
State of Hawaii.  Upon proof that the other Party(ies) *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
3 has/have violated either paragraph 1 or 2 of this 
Agreement, the prevailing Party(ies) shall be entitled to a 
permanent injunction against harassment against the other 
Party(ies) for the longest term that the Court can grant, 
in addition to reas onable attorney’s fees and costs.  
 
The parties also agreed that in the event of a breach of the 
Settlement Agreement, each could bring an action for breach of 
contract against the other to seek general and punitive damages.  
Case 134 was dismissed with prejudice
 by the district court.  
B.  District Court Proceedings 
  On October 25, 2015, the Uyedas submitted to the 
district court a Petition for Ex Parte Temporary Restraining 
Order and for Injunction Against Harassment against Schermer in 
a second civil case, numbered 3SS 15- 1-153K (“Case 153” or “the 
present case”).  The Uyedas submitted a copy of the Settlement 
Agreement under seal as an exhibit attached to the petition.  
The judge signed a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) on 
October 27, 2015; on November 10, 2015, the TRO was extended to 
December 15, 2015.  On October 27, 2015, the Uyedas filed a 
third civil action
 against Schermer  in district court , numbered 
3RC 15-1- 639K, (“Case 639”  or “the breach of contract case” ) 
alleging a breach of the Settlement Agreement.  The present case 
arises from Case 153. 
 
 Cases 153 and 639 both came before the district court 
on December 15, 2015.1  A bench trial was held on Case 639, the 
                     
1  The Honorable Margaret Masunaga presided.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
4 breach of contract case.  During  the trial, the court heard 
testimony from Schermer and Carolyn Uyeda, and received into 
evidence exhibits purporting to show Schermer’s  alleged 
violations.  The court also took judicial notice of the 
Settlement Agreement, which was  sealed by the court in Case 134.  
The court found that Schermer breached the Settlement A greement 
by putting an  advertisement in the newspaper wishing Carolyn 
Uyeda a happy birthday, sending a message to Carolyn Uyeda 
through Facebook, and attempting to contact Carolyn Uyeda by 
sending a message to a third party, her stepbrother Flavio 
Nucci, through Facebook.  The court found in favor of the Uyedas  
and awarded them nominal damages of $1.00, plus costs and fees. 
  With regard to Case 153, in which the Uyedas sought an 
injunction against harassment, the district court set a March 8, 
2016 trial date and extended the TRO to that date.  On January 
7, 2016, the Uyedas filed a motion for summary judgment.  The 
Uyedas requested that, in considering their motion, the court 
take judicial notice of the Settlement Agreement, which was 
filed under seal in Case 134, and the court’s own  findings in 
Case 639 regarding the birthday advertisement and the Facebook 
messages.  The Uyedas argued that Hawai ʻi Rules of Evidence (HRE) 
Rule 201 permitted the court to take judicial notice of its 
findings of fact in Case 639.  HRE Rule 201 allows  for judicial 
notice of adjudicative facts:  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
5  (a)  Scope of rule.  This rule governs only judicial 
notice of adjudicative facts.  
 
 (b)  Kinds of facts.  A judicially noticed fact must 
be one not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is 
either (1) generally known within the territorial 
jurisdiction of the trial court, or (2) capable of accurate 
and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy  
cannot reasonably be questioned.  
 
 (c)  When discretionary.  A court may take judicial 
notice, whether requested or not.  
 
 (d)  When mandatory.  A court shall take judicial 
notice if requested by a party and supplied with the 
necessary information.  
 
 (e)  Opportunity to be heard.  A party is entitled 
upon timely request to an opportunity to be heard as to the 
propriety of taking judicial notice and the tenor of the 
matter noticed.  In the absence of prior notification, the 
request may be made after judicial notice has been taken.  
 
 (f)  Time of taking notice.   Judicial notice may be 
taken at any stage of the proceeding.  
 
 (g)  Instructing jury.  In a civil proceeding, the 
court shall instruct the jury to accept as conclusive any 
fact judicially noticed.  In a criminal case, the court 
shall instruct the jury that it may, but is not required 
to, accept as conclusive any fact judicially noticed.  
 
Schermer submitted a memorandum in opposition to the motion for 
summary judgment, arguing that his alleged conduct did not 
constitute harassment, and that the court could not rely on its 
own findings in Case 639 because a permanent injunction against 
harassment cannot be issued without a judicial finding that 
harassment has been proved by clear and convincing evidence, 
whereas the standard of proof in a breach of contract case is 
only preponderance of the evidence.  Schermer also filed his own 
motion requesting either summary judgment, dismissal for failure 
to state a claim, or dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
6 Schermer contended that because the Uyedas’ claims arose from an 
intimate relationship, jurisdiction was exclusively with the 
Family Court of the Third Circuit (“family court”).  
  At a hearing on the motions held on January 19, 2016, 
the district court granted the Uyed as’ motion for summary 
judgment and granted them a permanent injunction for three 
years.  The court took judicial notice of the Settlement 
Agreement and “the entire record and files in 3RC 15 -1-639K, 
including the testimony of Carolyn Uyeda, Evan Schermer, and the 
entire record and file and entire testimony of all parties in 
that case[,]” and found that there was no genuine issue of 
material fact as to the Uyedas’ claims or defenses.  The court 
found “by clear and convincing evidence that haras sment exists 
for purposes of the instant action.”  Among the authorities the 
court cited were paragraph 7 of the Settlement Agreement, HRE 
Rule 201, “which allows Court to take judicial notice of 
adjudicative facts, specifically in case 3RC 15- 1-639K and 3SS 
14-1-134K,” and Hawai ʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) § 604- 10.5.  HRS § 
604-10.5 (2016) gives courts the power to enjoin harassment, as 
defined:  
 (a)  For the purposes of this section:  
 
 “Course of conduct” means a pattern of conduct 
composed of a series of acts over any period of time 
evidencing a continuity of purpose.  
 
 “Harassment” means:  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
7  (1)  Physical harm, bodily injury, assault, or 
the threat of imminent physical harm, bodily injury, 
or assault; or  
 
 (2)  An intentional or knowing course of 
conduct directed at an individual that seriously 
alarms or disturbs consistently or continually 
bothers the individual and serves no legitimate 
purpose; provided that such course of conduct would 
cause a reasonable person to suffer emotional 
distress.  
 
 (b)
  The district courts shall have the power to 
enjoin, prohibit, or temporarily restrain harassment.  
 
. . . . 
 
 (g)
  . . . If the court finds by clear and convincing 
evidence that harassment as defined in paragraph (1) of 
that definition exists, it may enjoin for no more than 
three years further harassment of the petitioner, or that 
harassment as defined in paragraph (2) of that definition 
exists, it shall enjoin for no more than three years 
further harassment of the petitioner; provided that this 
paragraph shall n
ot prohibit the court from issuing other 
injunctions against the named parties even if the time to 
which the injunction applies exceeds a total of three 
years. 
 
  In its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order 
granting the Uyedas’ motion for summary  judgment,  which was 
prepared by counsel for the Uyedas, the district court made the 
following findings of fact:  
 2.  There are no genuine issues of material fact.  
 
 3.  The Court has reviewed, and pursuant to Rule 201 
of the Hawaii Rules of Evidence, has  taken judicial notice 
of the parties, pleadings and holdings in Civil No. 3SS14 -
1
-134K and Civil No. 3RC15 -1-639K, along with the testimony 
introduced at the trial of Civil No. 3RC15 -1-639K and the 
content of that Mutual Settlement and Release Agreement 
dated September 22, 2014, and signed by the parties and 
their counsel at the time of execution and filed with the 
Petition in this case.  
 
 4.  That Respondent EVAN SCHERMER has engaged in an 
intentional and knowing course of conduct directed at 
Petitioners  CAROLYN UYEDA and JAY UYEDA that seriously 
alarms or disturbs or continually bothers the Petitioners 
and serves no legitimate purpose, causing emotional 
distress to the Petitioners.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
8  
The district court also made the following conclusion
s of law: 
 1. 
 That Petitioners have proven by clear and 
convincing evidence that they are entitled to an injunction 
against harassment against the Respondent based upon:  
 
 a. 
 Paragraph 7 of that Mutual Settlement and 
Release Agreement  dated September 22, 2014, and the 
Court’s findings in Civil No. 3RC15 -1-639K; and  
 
 b. 
 Hawaii Revised Statutes, Section 604 -10.5. 
 
The court denied Schermer’s motion for summary jud gment or 
dismissal.  Schermer moved for a new trial, and argued at the 
hearing on the motion that the court sho
uld not have taken 
judicial notice of the testimony from Case 639, but his motion 
for a new trial was denied. 
C.  ICA Proceedings 
  
Schermer appealed to the ICA.  On appeal, Schermer 
argued that the district court erred in granting summary 
judgment to the Uyedas because the requirements of HRS § 604-
10.5 were not met and harassment as therein defined was not 
proven by clear and convincing evidence.  Schermer, citing State 
v. Kotis, 91 Hawai ʻi 319, 341 -42, 984 P.2d 78, 100- 01 (1999), 
also argued that while the district court could take judicial 
notice of the existence of documents filed in the previous 
cases, it could not take judicial notice of the truth of the 
facts in those documents.  He conceded, however, that he would 
be collaterally estopped from relitigating the facts or issues 
in Case 639.  The Uyedas argued that the district court did not *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
9 abuse its discretion by taking judicial notice of its prior 
findings. 
  The ICA held that the district court did not err by 
granting the Uyedas’ motion for summary judgment, by denying 
Schermer’s motion for summary judgment , or by ordering an 
injunction against harassment with regards to Carolyn Uyeda, but 
vacated the judgment and injunction as to Jay Uyeda.   Uyeda v. 
Schermer, No. CAAP-16 -0000200, 2017 WL 4337165, at *3  (App. 
Sept. 19, 2017) (SDO).  With regard to the district court taking 
judicial notice of the parties, pleadings, and holdings in Case 
134, the ICA held that any error was harmless, because (1) there 
were no holdings, as Case 134 was dismissed with prejudice, and 
Schermer did not identify how he was prejudiced by the court 
taking notice of the parties and pleadings in the case; and (2) 
there was sufficient evidence from other sources to support the 
judgment in the present case.  Id. at *2. 
  The ICA also held that it was proper under HRE Rule 
201 for the district court to take judicial notice of its 
finding of fact in Case 639 that Schermer had breached the 
Settlement Agreement.  Id.   The ICA itself took judicial notice 
of Finding of Fact 3 from Case 639, which read:  
 The Court finds that [Schermer] has breached the 
Settlement Agreement by: (1) indirect contact with the 
[Uyedas] by placing an advertisement in the West Hawaii 
Today newspaper on August 7, 8, 9, 2015, containing the 
picture of [Carolyn] w ith the caption “Happy Birthday 
Carolyn!!!  Wishing you a great day!!!; (2) direct contact *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
10 with [the Uyedas] by sending two (2) Facebook messages to 
[Carolyn] on October 4, 2015, one at 1:45 a.m. (HST) and 
one at 2:25 a.m. (HST); and (3) communication by [Schermer] 
with a third -party, Flavio Nucci, through a Facebook 
message on November 2, 2015.   
 
Id. at *2 n.5 (b rackets in original).   Based on the “undisputed ” 
and “authenticated ” evidence of the Settlement Agreement, the 
birthday advertisement, and the Facebook messages, the ICA held 
that “there was no genuine issue as to whether Schermer 
intentionally and knowingly engaged in a course of conduct 
directed at Carolyn for an illegitimate purpose and, as a 
result, a reasonable person in Carolyn’s position wou ld have 
been consistently disturbed or continually bothered and 
emotionally distressed.”  Id. at *3.  However, t he ICA held  that 
the district court erred by denying Schermer’s summary judgment 
motion and granting the Uyedas ’ summary judgment motion as to 
Jay Uyeda, because the birthday advertisement and Facebook 
message to Carolyn were not “directed at” Jay, and the Facebook 
message to Nucci, even if directed at Jay, was a single act that 
could not constitute a “course of conduct.”  Id. (quoting HRS § 
604-10.5(a)). 
  Chief Judge Nakamura filed a separate opinion, 
dissenting from the majority’s decision to affirm the district 
court’s grant of summary judgment with regard to Carolyn Uyeda.  
Id. at *3-*6  (Nakamura, C.J., dissenting).  Chief Judge Nakamura 
argued that the district court erred in taking judicial notice *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
11 of the testimony presented at trial in Case 639 under HRE Rule 
201 because the burden of proof in the breach of contract action 
(preponderance of the evidence) was lower that their burden of 
proof in the present case (clear and convincing evidence).  Id.  
at *4-*5.  “Given this difference in the Uyedas’ burden of 
proof,” Chief Judge Nakamura would have held that it was not 
appropriate “
for the District Court to apply collateral estoppel 
to, or take judicial notice of, its findings in Case 639 as a 
basis for granting summary judgment.”   Id. at *5. 
  Even if judicial notice was appropriate, Chief Judge 
Nakamura argued that the findings in Case 639 that Schermer 
breached the Settlement Agreement were not sufficient to 
establish that, as a matter of law, Schermer committed 
harassment under HRS § 604- 10.5.  Id.  He argued that the Uyedas 
did not present any evidence regarding the circumstances 
surrounding the attempted contacts or C arolyn Uyeda’s reaction, 
and that the findings in Case 639, viewed in the light most 
favorable to Schermer, were insufficient to prove as a matter of 
law that Schermer had engaged in harassment as defined by 
statute.  Id.  Finally, Chief Judge Nakamura noted that an 
injunction against harassment can be imposed only if the 
statutory requirements are met, and that the district court was 
not bound to the remedy in a private agreement between the 
Uyedas and Schermer, nor was the agreement sufficient to *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
12 authorize the imposition of an injunction in the absence of the 
statutory requirements being met.  Id.  He expressed no opinion 
as to whether the Uyedas could establish their entitlement to an 
injunction under the statute, stating only that “based on what 
the Uyedas presented in support of their motion for summary 
judgment, neither Carolyn nor Jay established that they were 
entitled to summary judgment on their petition for an injunction 
against harassment under HRS § 604- 10.5.”  Id. at *6. 
D.  Supreme Court Proceedings  
  Both Schermer and the Uyedas filed applications for 
writs of certiorari.  On May 23, 2016, Schermer’s application 
was granted and the Uyedas’ was denied.  
  In his application for certiorari, Schermer presented 
the following three questions:  
 1.
  Whether the ICA gravely erred in concluding that 
the District Court did not err in taking judicial notice of 
the testimony presented at trail in a separate case, (Case 
639), because that testimony was not the proper subject of 
judicial notice under HRE Rul
e 201? 
 
 2.  Whether the ICA gravely erred in concluding that 
an injunction against harassment under HRS § 604 -10.5 could 
be imposed where the requirements of the statute have not 
been satisfied?  
 
 3.  Whether the ICA gravely erred in concluding that 
the record in this case is sufficient to support the 
District Court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of 
either Carolyn Uyeda (Carolyn) or Jay Uyeda (Jay) on their 
petition for an injunction against harassment against Evan 
Schermer (Schermer)?  
 
Schermer’s application argued that all three questions
 should be 
answered in the affirmative.  With regard to the first question, *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
13 Schermer also adopted the argument from Chief Judge Nakamura’s 
dissent that it was not appropriate for the district court to 
take judicial notice of the findings of fact in Case 639.  With 
regard to the third question, Schermer argued  that the district 
court lacked jurisdiction over the case, which he contended 
should have been heard by the family court, and that the 
district court’s findi ngs of fact and conclusions of law
, 
including its finding that there were no genuine issues of 
material fact, were clearly erroneous. 
II.  STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A.  Jurisdiction 
 
 “The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law 
that this court reviews de  novo under the right/wrong standard.”  
Bailey v. Duvauchelle, 135 Hawai ʻi 482, 488, 353 P.3d 1024, 1030 
(2015) (brackets omitted) (quoting 
Amantiad v. Odum, 90 Hawaiʻi 
152, 158, 977 P.2d 160, 166 (1999)).  
B.  Judicial Notice 
  “The question of whether a particular fact is a proper 
subject for judicial notice is a question of law that is 
reviewed by this court de novo.”  Ditto v. McCurdy, 98 Hawaiʻi 
123, 128, 44 P.3d 274, 279 (2002).   
C.  Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law 
 We review a [trial] court’ s findings of fact under 
the clearly erroneous standard.  A finding of fact is 
clearly erroneous when either the record lacks substantial 
evidence to support the finding, or, evidence exists to *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
14 support the finding, but we are left with the definite and 
firm conviction in reviewing the entire evidence that a 
mistake has been committed.  We review a [trial] court’s 
conclusions of law de novo under the right/wrong standard.  
Where a conclusion of law presents a mixed question of law 
and fact, we review this conclusion under the clearly 
erroneous standard.  A mixed question of law and fact is a 
conclusion dependent upon the facts and circumstances of 
the particular case.  
 
Narayan v. Ass’ n of Apartment Owners of Kapalua Bay Condo., 140 
Hawaiʻi 75, 83, 398 P.3d 664, 672 (2017) (internal citations and 
quotation marks omitted).  
 
D.  Motion for Summary Judgment 
  “On appeal, the grant or denial of summary judgment is 
reviewed de novo .”  Ibbetson v. Kaiawe, 143 Hawai ʻi 1, 10, 422 
P.3d 1, 10 (2018) (quoting Nuuanu Val ley Ass’n v. City & Cty. of 
Honolulu, 119 Hawaiʻi 90, 96, 194 P.3d 531, 537 (2008)). 
Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, 
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on 
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there 
is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the 
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  A 
fact is material if proof of that fact would have the 
effect of establishing or refuting one of the essential 
elements of a cause of action or defense asserted by the 
parties.  The evidence must be viewed in the light most 
favorable to the non -moving party.  In other words, we must 
view all of the evidence and inferences drawn therefrom in 
the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. 
 
Id. at 10-11, 422 P.3d at 10-11 (brackets omitted) (quoting 
Nuuanu Valley Ass’n , 119 Hawaiʻ i at 96, 194 P.3d at 537).   
[W]here the non -movant bears the burden of proof at trial, 
a movant may demonstrate that there is no genuine issue of 
material fact by either:  (1) presenting evidence negating 
an element of the non -movant's claim, or (2) demonstrating 
that the non -movant will be unable to carry his or her 
burden of proof at trial.

E.  Injunctive Relief 
  “Generally, the granting or denying of injunctive 
relief rests with the sound discretion of the trial court and 
the trial court’s decision will be sustained absent a showing of

202 P.3d 1226, 1242 (2009)).  “ A court abuses its discretion if 
it ‘clearly exceeds  the bounds of reason or disregards rules or 
principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a 
party litigant.’”  AC v. AC, 134 Hawai ʻi 221, 229, 339 P.3d 719,

III.  DISCUSSION 
A.  The district court had jurisdiction to hear this case.  
  Because  “subject -matter jurisdiction is fundamental to 
a court’s power to act on the merits of a case from the outset 
of the action,” Schwartz v. State, 136 Hawaiʻi 258, 263, 361 P.3d 
1161, 1166 (2015), we first consider Schermer’s argument that 
the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss for 
lack of jurisdiction. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
16  
 In Schermer’s combined motion for summary judgment 
and/or dismissal for failure to state a claim and/or dismissal 
for lack of jurisdiction, he argued that Carolyn Uyeda’s 
petition was improperly filed in the district court, and should 
have instead been filed in the 
family court, because the 
relationship between Carolyn Uyeda and Schermer was one over 
which the family court has jurisdiction under statute.  
Specifically, Schermer claimed that his relationship with 
Carolyn Uyeda was “characterized by actions of an intimate or 
sexual nature,” HRS § 586 -1, and that jurisdiction was therefore 
conferred on the family court by HRS § 586- 2.2  He also claimed 
that even though Jay Uyeda did not have to file a petition in 
the family court, Carolyn Uyeda could not “bootstrap[]” her 
claims onto Jay Uyeda’s.  In denying Schermer’s motion, the 
district court held that it had jurisdiction “over all parties 
and of the subject matter of this case[ .]”  The ICA did not 
address the jurisdictional issue.  
 
 Schermer’s jurisdictional argument fails because the 
action was filed under HRS § 604- 10.5, the statute authorizing 
the district courts to enjoin and temporarily restrain 
harassment.  The Uyedas did not seek family court jurisdiction 
pursuant to HRS § 586-2  to obtain a protective order.  
                     
2  HRS § 586 -2 (2018) provides, “An application for relief under 
this chapter may be filed in any family court in the circuit in which the 
petitioner resides.  Actions under this chapter shall be given docket 
priorities by the court.”  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
17   Thus, the district court was correct in holding that 
it had jurisdiction over the parties and subject matter of the 
case, and the ICA did not err by failing to rever se the district 
court’s denial of Schemer’s motion for dismissal on the basis of 
jurisdiction.  
B.  The district court should not have taken judicial notice of 
the facts of Case 639.  
 
 In granting the Uyedas’ motion for summary judgment, 
the district court took judicial notice of certain adjudicative 
facts3 from Case 134, the original case resolved by the 
Settlement Agreement, and Case 639, the breach of contract case 
decided in favor of the Uyedas.  At the motions hearing, the 
court stated that it was taking judicial notice of the 
Settlement Agreement and “the entire record and files” in Case s 
134 and 639, “including the testimony of Carolyn Uyeda, Evan 
Schermer, and the entire record and file and entire testimony of 
all parties in that case.”   In its Findings of Fact, Conclusions 
of Law and Order granting the Uyedas’ motion, which was prepared 
by counsel for the Uyedas, the court stated that it had taken 
judicial notice of “the parties, pleadings and holdings” in both 
cases, “along with the testimony i ntroduced at the trial of 
[Case 639] and the content of that [Settlement Agreement] dated 
                     
3  Adjudicative facts, as distinguished from legislative facts, “are 
the kinds of facts that are ordinarily decided by the trier of fact; for 
example, who did what  to whom, when, where, how, and why.”  State v. Puaoi, 
78 Hawaiʻi 185, 190, 891 P.2d 272, 277 (1995) . *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
18 September 22, 2014, and signed by the parties and their counsel 
at the time of execution and filed with the Petition in this 
case.” 
  The ICA held that any error in taking judicial notice 
of the parties, pleadings, and holdings in both cases was 
harmless, and that the finding of fact in Case 639 that Schermer 
breached the Settlement Agreement was a proper subject of 
judicial notice.  Uyeda, 2017 WL at *2.  In  his disse nt, Chief 
Judge Nakamura argued that the district court erred in taking 
judicial notice of the testimony and findings of fact in Case 
639.  Id. at *4- *5 (Nakamura, C.J., dissenting).  Schermer 
echoed these arguments in his application, challenging the 
district court’s taking  of judicial notice of the testimony and 
findings of fact presented in Case 639.  However, he did not 
challenge the district court’s decision to take judicial notice 
of the Settlement Agreement or any additional parts of the 
record in either Case 134 or Case 639.   
1.  Proper scope of judicial notice 
  HRE Rule 201(b) permits a court to take judicial 
notice of a fact “not subject to reasonable dispute in that it 
is either (1) generally known within the territorial 
jurisdiction of the trial court, or (2) capable of accurate and 
ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot 
reasonably be questioned.”  In other words, “[a] fact is a *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
19 proper subject for judicial notice if it is common knowledge or 
easily verifiable.”  Almeida v. Correa, 51 Haw. 594, 605, 465 
P.2d 563, 572 (1970).  “The most frequent use of judicial notice 
of ascertainable facts is in noticing the contents of court 
records.”  State v. Akana, 68 Haw. 164, 165, 706 P.2d 1300, 1302 
(1985).  The “ready availability and accuracy” of c ourt records, 
particularly those that are “the trial court’s own file and in 
the court’s immediate possession [,]” generally cannot be 
considered reasonably questionable.  Id. at 166, 706 P.2d at 
1302.   
  We have “indicated that a trial co urt may take 
judicial notice of ‘the pleadings, findings of fact and 
conclusions of law’ filed in a separate court proceeding[,]”  
Kotis, 91 Hawaiʻi at 341, 984 P.2d at 100 (quoting Fujii v. 
Osborne, 67 Haw. 322, 329, 687 P.2d 1333, 1338-39 (1984)), and 
have explicitly “validated the practice of taking judicial 
notice of a court’s own records in an interrelated proceeding 
where the parties are the same[,]” Akana, 68 Haw. at 165, 706 
P.2d at 1302.  However, “[a]  distinction must be carefully drawn 
between taking judicial notice of the existence  of documents in 
the Court file as opposed to the truth of the facts asserted in 
those documents.”  Kotis, 91 Hawaiʻi at 342, 984 P.2d at  101 
(quoting In re Snider Farms, Inc., 83 B.R. 977, 986 (N.D.Ind. 
1988) (emphasis in original)).  “Factual allegations, *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
20 conclusions, and findings[,] whether authored by the court, by 
the parties or their attorneys, or by third persons, should not 
be noticed to prove the truth of the matters asserted even 
though the material happens t o be contained in court records.”  
Addison M. Bowman, 
Hawaii Rules of Evidence Manual 2- 5 (2014- 15 
ed.).  A court “may only take judicial notice of the truth of 
facts asserted in documents such as orders, judgments, and 
findings of fact and conclusions of law because of the 
principles of collateral estoppel, res judicata, and the law of 
the case.”  Kotis, 91 Hawaiʻi at 342, 984 P.2d at 101 (quoting 
Snider Farms, 83 B.R. at 986 (emphasis in original)). 
  For example, in Akana, the issue was whether the trial 
court properly took notice of the court records in a criminal 
case which showed that Akana had been convicted of a felony 
while deciding the State’s motion to revoke Akana’s probation, 
one of the conditions of which was that he obey all laws.  68 
Haw. at 164-65, 706 P.2d at 1302.  The State requested that the 
court take judicial notice of the records, which the court was 
mandated to do under HRE Rule 201(d) so long as the facts of 
which it was taking judicial notice were consistent with HRE 
Rule 201(b).  Id. at 165-66, 706 P.2d at 1302.  We held that 
“the trial court was mandated to take judicial notice of the 
court records” in the criminal case.  Id. at 166, 706 P.2d at 
1302.  The existence of a conviction properly recorded in court *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
21 records is an adjudicative fact “capable of accurate and ready 
determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot 
reasonably be questioned.”  HRE Rule 201(b).  But the facts 
underlying that conviction could not have been the proper 
subject of judicial notice. 
  Other jurisdictions make a similar distinction, 
permitting courts to take judicial notice of court records, but 
allowing them to take judicial notice of findings of fact for 
the truth of the matters asserted only for the purpose of 
determining collateral estoppel and res judicata.  See, e.g., 
Thompson v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 760 F.3d 913, 917 –18 (8th 
Cir. 2014) (explaining that the district court properly took 
judicial notice of a previous judgment in a wrongful death case 
to determine whether the pla
intiffs no longer had a viable 
wrongful death claim); Horne v. Potter , 392 F. App’x 800, 802 
(11th Cir. 2010) (finding that taking judicial notice of the 
pleadings and orders in a prior case is proper before evaluating 
whether res judicata applied).  
2.  Testimony and findings of fact from the breach of 
contract case 
  In this case, the district court exceeded the proper 
scope of judicial notice with regard to Case 639, the breach of 
contract case, but it is not entirely clear how far beyond the 
proper scope it went.  At the motions hearing, the district *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
22 court stated that it took notice of “the entire record and 
files” in Case 639, “ including the testimony of Carolyn Uyeda, 
Evan Schermer, and the entire record and file and entire 
testimony of all parties in that case.”  In its written order, 
the court wrote that it had taken judicial notice of “the 
parties, pleadings and holdings” in Case 639, as well as “the 
testimony introduced at the trial” of Case 639.  Because the 
court did not specify which  testimony, findings of fact, or 
other evidence from Case 639 supported its findings of fact and 
conclusions of law in the present case, we are unable to 
determine exactly how much of the record of Case 639 was 
judicially noticed.  We therefore consider how much of the  
record in Case 639 was subject to judicial notice and determine 
whether the findings of fact and conclusions of law in this case 
could be supported by such evidence. 
  
As laid out above, it would have been permissible for 
the district court to take judicial notice of the existence of 
the pleadings, findings of fact, and conclusions of law from 
Case 639.  Kotis , 91 Hawaiʻi at 341-42 , 984 P.2d at 100-01.  T he 
testimony from Case 639 was subject to the same restrictions,  as 
part of the “court’s own records i n an interrelated proceeding 
where the parties are the same.”  Akana, 68 Haw. at 165, 706 
P.2d at 1302.  The district court could only have “take[n] 
judicial notice of the truth of facts asserted in documents such *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
23 as orders, judgment
s, and findings of fact and conclusions of 
law because of the principles of collateral estoppel, res 
judicata, and the law of the case.”   Kotis, 91 Hawai ʻi at 342, 
984 P.2d at 101 (quoting Snider Farms, 83 B.R. at 986  (emphasis 
in original)).  
  As neither the doctrine of res judicata or of the law 
of the case are applicable here, we must determine whether it 
would have been appropriate for the district court to take 
judicial notice of the truth of the matters asserted in the 
findings of fact and conclusions of law in Case 639 for the 
purposes of collateral estoppel.  Collateral estoppel, also 
referred to as issue preclusion, “ may preclude the relitigation 
of a fact or issue that was previously determined in a prior 
action on a different claim or cause of action between the same 
parties or their privies ” and applies “ if the particular issue 
in question was actually litigated, finally decided, and 
essential to the earlier valid and final judgment. ”  Dannenberg 
v. State, 139 Hawaiʻi 39, 59–60, 383 P.3d 1177, 1197 –98 (2016) 
(emphases omitted); see Priceline.com, Inc. v. Dir. of Taxation, 
No. SCAP-17 -0000367, 2019 WL 1011874, at *13 (Haw. Mar. 4, 2019) 
(“Issue preclusion . . . protects the core judicial power to 
render final decisions as to facts and law in specific 
controversies. . . .  [I]ssue preclusion makes judicial 
determinations conclusive and prevents a party from repeatedly *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
24 litigating adverse decisions in the hopes of securing a more 
favorable outcome.”) .   
  However, as many other  states have held, “ a prior 
judicial decision cannot have issue preclusive effect if the 
plaintiff had a higher burden of proof in the earlier proceeding 
than in the later proceeding .”  White v. City of Pasadena, 671 
F.3d 918, 930 (9th Cir. 2012) (applying California law); see, 
e.g., Jarosz v. Palmer, 766 N.E.2d 482, 488 (Mass. 2002) (citing 
Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 28(4) (Am. Law Inst. 1982)); 
State v. Yelli, 530 N.W.2d 250, 254 (Neb. 1995) (citing 18 
Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Edward H. Cooper, Federal 
Practice and Procedure § 4422 (1981)); Attorney Grievance Comm’ n 
of Maryland v. Bear, 763 A.2d 175, 181 (Md. 2000) (finding that 
this proposition “ seems to be generally accepted by federal and 
state courts”).  To apply issue preclusion in cases where the 
burden was lower in the prior case “would be to hold, in effect, 
that the losing party in the first action would also have lost 
had a significantly different burden [been] imposed.”  
Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 28 cmt. f (Am. Law Inst. 
1982). 
  Case 639 was a breach of contract case, so the 
standard of proof was “preponderance of the evidence.”  See 
Masaki v. Gen. Motors Corp., 71 Haw. 1, 14, 780 P.2d 566, 574 
(1989).  The present case was brought under HRS § 604-10.5, *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
25 which permits the district court to enjoin harassment “[i]f the 
court finds by clear and convincing evidence” that harassment 
exists.  HRS § 604-10.5(g).  The “clear and convincing evidence” 
standard is “an intermediate standard of proof greater than a 
preponderance of the evidence, but less than proof beyond a 
reasonable doubt required in criminal cases.”  Masaki, 71 Haw. 
at 15, 780 P.2d at 574.  Thus, the standard of proof in the 
present case was higher than it was in Case 639, so the truth of 
any facts asserted in the findings of fact and conclusions of 
law in Case 639 could not be noticed for the purpose of 
collateral estoppel.   
C.  Because the district court erroneously took judicial notice 
of the facts of Case 639, its findings of fact, conclusions of 
law, and order granting summary judgment and an injunction to 
the Uyedas in this case were erroneous. 
  Having concluded that the record  of Case 639 was  
properly subject to judicial notice only as to its  existence, 
and not for the facts asserted therein, the next consideration 
is whether the findings of fact, conclusion of law, judgment, 
and remedy in the present case withstand review absent judicial 
notice of the facts asserted in the record of Case 639.  T hey do 
not. 
  At the time the Uyedas filed their motion for summary 
judgment, the substantive record in the present case consisted 
only of the Uyedas’ petition and the attached exhibits and *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
26 declarations.  Absent the improperly
 noticed facts asserted in 
the record of Case 639, the district court’s findings that 
“[t]here are no genuine issues of material fact” and that 
“Respondent EVAN SCHERMER has engaged in an intentional and 
knowing course of conduct directed at Petitioners CAROLYN UYEDA 
and JAY UYEDA that seriously alarms or disturbs or continually 
bothers the Petitioners and serves no legitimate purpose, 
causing emotional distress to the Petitioners” were clearly 
erroneous, as they lacked  any basis in the record other than the 
allegations in the Uyedas’ petition .4  Similarly, the district 
court’s conclusions of law  relying on those findings, namely 
that the Uyedas had proven by clear and convincing evidence that 
they are entitled to an injunction against harassment against 
Schermer under the Settlement Agreement and HRS § 604-10.5, were  
incorrect.   
 
 The  district court also erred in granting the Uyedas’ 
motion for summary judgment and in granting them injunctive 
relief.  The grant of summary judgment was erroneous  because, 
viewing all the properly admitted or noticed evidence in the 
                     
4  The ICA held that, based on the copies of the birthday 
advertisement and the Facebook messages the Uyedas submitted to the district 
court in this case, there were no genuine issues of material fact as to 
whether Schermer’s actions constituted harassment under HRS § 604 -10.5(a)(2).  
However, whether these communications were an intentional and knowing course 
of conduct that would seriously alarm, consistently disturb, or continually 
bother Carolyn Uyeda, serve no legitimate purpose, and cause a reasonable 
person to suffer emotional distress was a genuine issue of material fact that 
could not be resolved on the face of the communications themselves.  Thus, a 
summary judgment was inappropriate.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
27 light most favorable to Schermer, the genuine issues of material 
fact were not resolved in favor of the Uyedas.  And  the grant of 
an injunction was an abuse of discretion because its issuance 
was not supported by “clear and convincing evidence,” as 
required by statute.   HRS § 604 -10.5(g).  
  Furthermore, the Settlement Agreement did  not, in the 
absence of statutory authority, entitle the Uyedas to an 
injunction based on a breach of the agreement .  The statute 
authorizes the issuance of an injunction against harassment only 
when harassment has been proven by “clear and convincing 
evidence,” HRS § 604 -10.5(g), and a contractual agreement 
between two private parties cannot lower the statutory 
evidentiary burden nor grant the court power  it would not 
otherwise have.   
  We need not determine whether the findings of fact, 
conclusions of law, grant of summary judgment, and issuance of 
an injunction would have been upheld if the improperly noticed 
evidence was properly admitted at trial.  We only note that, on 
remand, the Uyedas must meet the requirements of HRS § 604- 10.5 
in order for an injunction to issue.  And while a trial in the 
present case would involve much of the same evidence as was 
presented in Case 639, facts found in Case 639  have no issue 
preclusive effect in the present case given the increased burden 
of proof and the additional requirements of  HRS § 604 -10.5. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
28 IV.  CONCLUSION 
  For the foregoing reasons, the ICA’s judgment and the 
district court’s grant  of summary judgment and injunction are 
vacated, and the case is remanded to the District Court of the 
Third Circuit for further proceedings consistent with this 
opinion.
