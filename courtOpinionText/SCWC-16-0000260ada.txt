(“Yamamoto”) is required to arbitrate claims against Tom Chee

 complaint filed in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit1 
(“circuit court”).    
When Yamamoto, a founding partner of the Law Firm, left the 
Partnership, she handed Chee a personal check made payable to 
the Law Firm to repay a 401(k) loan.  Chee allegedly knew that 
the 401(k) loan had already been repaid from Yamamoto’s 
Partnership capital account but did not inform Yamamoto.  When 
Yamamoto later demanded that Defendants return the funds from 
her personal check, Defendants refused.    
After Yamamoto filed suit, on December 16, 2015, Defendants 
moved to compel arbitration of Yamamoto’s claims  (“motion to 
compel”).  Defendants asserted that the agreement founding the 
Partnership (the “Partnership Agreement”), signed by Yamamoto, 
required the arbitration of any disputes “in connection with” 
that agreement.  The circuit court granted Defendants’ motion to 
compel, concluding Yamamoto’s claims arose out of the 
Partnership Agreement, and therefore the arbitration clause 
applied.  Additionally, the circuit court concluded Defendants 
had provided appropriate notice to initiate the arbitration 
under Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes (“HRS”) § 658A -9 (Supp. 2001).2   
                     
1  The Honorable Edwin C. Nacino presided.  
 
2  HRS § 658A- 9 (Supp. 2001) provides as follows:  
(a) A person initiates an arbitration proceeding by giving 
notice in a record to the other parties to the agreement to 
arbitrate in the agreed manner between the parties or, in 
the absence of agreement, by certified or registered mail, ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 The Intermediate Court of Appeals (“ICA”) affirmed the  
circuit court, concluding Defendants had provided adequate 
notice and that Yamamoto’s allegations “touch[ed] [the] 
matter[]” of the handling of her Partnership capital account, 
which was covered by the Partnership Agreement.  Yamamoto v. 
Chee, CAAP-16- 0000260, at 4  (App. Apr. 13, 2018) (SDO).  
Yamamoto asserts the ICA erred on both issues, and presents the 
following two questions in her certiorari application:  
A. Whether the [ICA] used the wrong test and ignored 
precedent to determine the arbitrability of a dispute under 
an agreement?  
 
B. Whether strict compliance with § 658A -9, HRS is required 
and if so, whether the statute is jurisdictional?  
 
Corollary: Whether it is reversible error to allow a party, 
effectively, to give a proper § 658A -9, HRS notice after 
that party filed a motion to compel?  
 
 For the reasons set forth below, we hold the ICA erred when 
it concluded that (1) Yamamoto’s claims were “in connection 
with” the Partnership Agreement, and (2) compliance with HRS § 
658A-9’s notice requirements is not required to initiate 
arbitration. 
                                                                  
return receipt requested and obtained, or by service as 
authorized for the commencement of a civil action. The 
notice shall describe the nature of the controversy and the 
remedy sought. 
 
(b) Unless a person objects for lack or insufficiency of 
notice under section 658A -15(c) before the beginning of the 
arbitration hearing, by appearing at the hearing the person 
waives any objection to lack of or insufficiency of notice.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 Accordingly, we vacate the ICA’s May 15, 2018 Judgment on 
Appeal and remand this case to the circuit c
ourt for further 
proceedings consistent with this opinion. 
II. Background 
The Law Firm, a limited liability law partnership, was 
formed effective January 1, 2012 pursuant to a Partnership 
Agreement signed by Yamamoto, Chee, and others.  Yamamoto was a 
partner in the Law Firm for eight months until August 31, 2012.  
Chee, the chairperson of the Law Firm’s management committee, 
apparently wished to move the Law Firm’s 401(k) accounts to 
another company, to be managed by his personal financial 
advisor.  To accomplish the move, Chee proposed that the Law 
Firm pay all loans made against the 401(k) accounts.  Then, once 
the 401(k) accounts were moved to the new management company, 
new loans would be made against the 401(k) accounts to repay the 
Law Firm.    
Yamamoto had a loan against her 401(k) account in the 
amount of $19,134.31.  Yamamoto and Chee agreed that she would 
repay the Law Firm directly when she received the distribution 
of her 401(k) funds after she left the partnership.  However, on 
August 31, 2012, the Law Firm allegedly debited $19,134.31 from 
Yamamoto’s Partnership capital account to repay the loan without 
her knowledge or consent.    ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
5 
 Unaware that her Partnership capital account had already 
been debited $19,134.31 to repay the Law Firm, Yamamoto handed 
Chee a personal check payable to the Law Firm for the same 
amount.  Yamamoto apparently told Chee that the check was to 
repay the firm as they had previously agreed.  Additionally, the 
memo line of the personal check read “401K loan repay.”    
Chee alleg edly knew the Law Firm had already been repaid 
but concealed from Yamamoto that he had already debited 
Yamamoto’s capital account in the amount of $19,143.31.   
Yamamoto made numerous requests for the return of the funds 
obtained from her personal check, but Defendants refused to 
return them.  Yamamoto then filed a three- count complaint in the 
circuit court on August 27, 2015, asserting claims for 
conversion, fraudulent conversion, and punitive damages.    
On November 27, 2015, before Defendants’ deadline to  answer 
the complaint, Defendants’ counsel e -mailed Yamamoto’s counsel 
requesting that Yamamoto dismiss her complaint and submit the 
matter to arbitration pursuant to Article XIII, section 13.10 of 
the Partnership Agreement.”   This section states in its entirety 
(with emphasis added): 
Arbitration.  In the event of any dispute between or among 
the Partners in connection with this Agreement, such 
dispute shall be resolved by arbitration  as follows: said 
dispute shall be determined by a single arbitrator mutually 
agreed upon by the Partners involved; otherwise the 
arbitrator shall be selected by the executive in charge of 
the Honolulu office of Dispute Prevention & Resolution, 
Inc.  The arbitrator shall be neutral and qualified by 
reason of education and experience.  The parties to the ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
6 
 arbitration shall waive the rights provided in HRS §658A -
15(b)(2), and the fourth sentence of (c), 17(c), and 21 
(a), (c) and (e). 
The decision of the arbitrator selected 
in either manner shall be final, conclusive and binding on 
all parties to the arbitration. The decision may be 
enforced under HRS Chapter 658A. The allocation of the 
costs and expenditures of the arbitration, including 
attorneys’  fees and costs of the parties, shall be 
allocated between or among the parties to such arbitration 
as the arbitrator shall determine.  
 
 On December 16, 2015, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, 
the motion to compel, and a request for attorney’s fees and 
costs.  With respect to the motion to compel, Defendants argued 
that Yamamoto’s compl aint consisted of claims that arose in 
connection with Plaintiff’s status as a partner of the Law Firm.   
Defendants asserted Yamamoto’s claims “arose in reference to the 
law partnership because she seeks the recovery of moneys that 
she allegedly paid to [the Law Firm] with respect to a loan on 
her 401K account with [the Law Firm].”   Defendants explained, 
“All of Plaintiff’s claims hinge on the allegation that 
$19,143.31 was deducted from her capital account and paid to 
[the Law Firm] in advance of her repaying th at same amount to 
the firm.  To establish the truth or falsity of that central 
allegation requires an analysis of Plaintiff’s capital account 
and the credits and deductions to that account that were made in 
accordance with the Partnership Agreement.”     
In her response, Yamamoto argued that Defendants failed to 
comply with the notice requirements of HRS §  658A-9, which 
requires that absent an agreement between the parties regarding ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
7 
 the manner in which to initiate arbitration, arbitration may 
only be initiated “by certified or registered mail, return 
receipt requested and obtained, or by service as authorized for 
the commencement of a civil action.”   As the Partnership 
Agreement does not address the manner in which parties should 
initiate arbitration, and as Defendants’ e -mail did not comply 
with the statutory notice requirements, Yamamoto argued the 
motion to compel should be denied pursuant to Ueoka v. 
Szymanski, 107 Hawai ‘i 386, 395- 96, 114 P.3d 892, 901-02 (2005) 
(“[W]e believe that requiring a party to initiate arbitration 
before filing a motion to compel arbitration best supports the 
policy reasons behind encouraging arbitration . . . .  HRS § 
658A-9 . . . requires that the person seeking to initiate an 
arbitration proceeding satisfy certain formal requirements.”).   
Yamamoto also argued that the arbitration clause in the 
Partnership agreement did not apply to her claims because they 
are for conversion, or “civil theft” of the funds from her 
personal check, not Defendants’ use of her capital account funds 
to repay the Law Firm.  She posited that the Partnership 
Agreement does not require arbitration of conversion or theft 
claims.  Yamamoto argued th at the Law Firm was organized “solely 
for the purpose of rendering legal services and services 
ancillary thereto,” unrelated to the conversion of personal 
property.  Thus, Yamamoto contended that regardless of whether ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
8 
 “in connection with” is read narrowly or broadly, the conversion 
of personal funds “cannot possibly lie within the scope of an 
agreement covering the rendering of legal services.”   Moreover, 
Yamamoto argued, at the time she handed the personal check to 
Chee, she was no longer a partner in the firm, underscoring that 
the transaction did not hinge on her former partnership status.   
On January 13, 2016, subsequent to the filing of Yamamoto’s 
response but before the January 19, 2016 hearing date, 
Defendants filed with their reply a copy of a letter dated 
January 12, 20163 sent by certified mail, return receipt 
requested, demanding arbitration of Yamamoto’s complaint 
pursuant to Section 13.10 of the Law Firm’s Partnership 
Agreement.  The letter stated in its entirety:
 
This letter represents Defendan ts’ written demand for 
arbitration of Plaintiff’s Complaint filed August 27, 2015 
under 13.10 of the Partnership Agreement.  This written 
demand for arbitration is being sent pursuant to Haw. Rev. 
Stat. § 658 -9. 
Also attached to the January 13, 2016 filing was a copy of 
Defendants’ November 27, 2015 e -mail.  The record does not 
reflect whether Defendants obtained a return receipt for the 
January 12, 2016 letter.   
At the January 19, 2016 hearing, the circuit court granted 
Defendant’s motion to compel, concluding that Yamamoto’s 
                     
3  Although the letter is dated “January 12, 2015,” Defendants have noted 
the year should have read “2016.”  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
9 
 arguments were “form over substance,” as “[o]ur jurisdiction 
favors ADR in lieu of litigation.”   
Yamamoto timely appealed the circuit court’s order granting 
Defendant’s motion to compel, and presented two points of error:  
1. The circuit court erred in the construction and legal 
effect of the arbitration clause in finding that 
conversion of personal funds fell within the scope of 
the arbitration clause in the partnership agreement 
between Plaintiff -Appellant and Defendants -Appellants 
entered into to provide legal and ancillary services 
thereto . . . . 
 
2. The circuit court erred in finding that strict 
compliance with the formal notice requirements in 
Section 658A -9 HRS was not required before filing a 
motion to compel arbitration pursuant to Section 658A -7, 
HRS . . . . 
 
The ICA affirmed the circuit court’s order.  Yamamoto , SDO at 9.    
With respect to whether Defendants had issued proper notice 
pursuant to HRS §  658A-9, the ICA concluded the circuit court did 
not err in determining that the January 12, 2016 letter had 
satisfied statutory notice requirements, even though the letter 
was mailed nearly a month after the motion to compel.  See  
Yamamoto, SDO at 8.  According to the ICA, Ueoka does not 
mandate the denial of a motion to compel where notice is given 
after the filing of the motion.  See  Yamamoto , SDO at 7.  The 
ICA first opined that Ueok a was distinguishable because, in that 
case, this court noted that the parties who sought arbitration 
had not filed a demand for arbitration at any time “[d]espite 
the circuit court’s stated willingness to reconsider the stay 
issue if a demand for arbitration was filed.”  Yamamoto, SDO at ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
10 
 7 (quoting Ueoka, 107 Hawai ‘i
 at 395, 114 P.3d at 901).  
Accordingly, the ICA reasoned, nothing in Ueoka  prohibits the 
parties from curing any defective notice.   
Second, the ICA explained that the written notice 
requirement in the Uniform Arbitration Act, upon which HRS 
chapter 658A is based , “serves as the functional equivalent of 
notice pleading in a court action.”  Yamamoto , SDO at 6 (quoting 
Block v. Plosia, 916 A.2d 475, 482 (N.J. App. Div. 2007)).  
Thus, the ICA concluded, because the January 12, 2016 letter 
“demand[ed] arbitration of []Plaintiff’s Complaint,” and because 
a copy of the November 27, 2015 e- mail stating that Defendants 
sought to resolve Yamamoto’s claims by arbitration pursuant to 
the Partnership Agreement’s arbitration clause was attached to 
the letter, Defendants had pro vided “a short and plain 
statement” that sufficiently “notified Yamamoto of what they 
wanted to arbitrate.”  See Yamamoto , SDO at 6- 7. 
Third, according to the ICA, although “initiating 
arbitration before filing a motion to compel ‘best supports’ the 
statute’s rationale” of promoting alternative methods of dispute 
resolution in an effort to reduce litigation, it would be 
inconsistent with the arbitration statutes’ stated policy to 
reduce the caseload of the courts to (1) deny the motion to 
compel, (2) require a new demand to be made, and (3) then ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
11 
 require a new motion to compel before hearing a motion to compel 
arbitration.  See Yamamoto, SDO at 8 -9. 
As to whether the arbitration clause of the Partnership 
Agreement encompassed Yamamoto’s claims, the ICA’s anal ysis 
focused on the “in connection with” language from the clause: 
“In the event of any dispute between or among the Partners in 
connection with this Agreement, such dispute shall be resolved 
by arbitration . . . .”  Yamamoto , SDO at 3 (emphasis in 
original).  The ICA first observed that other courts have 
construed “arising in connection with” (which the ICA viewed as 
no different from “in connection with”) broadly when addressing 
arbitration clauses.  Yamamoto , SDO at 3 (citing Simula, Inc. v. 
Autoliv, Inc., 175 F.3d 716, 721 (9th Cir. 1999); Coffman v. 
Provost * Umphrey Law Firm, L.L.P., 161 F. Supp. 2d 720, 725 
(E.D. Tex. 2001), aff’d sub nom.  Coffman v. Provost Umphrey LLP, 
33 F.Appx 705 (5th Cir. 2002)). 
The ICA then turned to Yamamoto’s specific factual 
allegations, as “[w]hether a claim falls within the scope of an 
arbitration agreement turns on the factual allegations in the 
complaint.”  Yamamoto, SDO at 4 (quoting Cty. of Hawai ʻi v. 
Unidev, LLC, 129 Hawai ‘i 378, 396,  301 P.3d 588, 606 (2013)).  
The ICA summarized Yamamoto’s allegations as follows:  
(1) Chee debited [Yamamoto’s] partnership capital account 
without her consent; (2) Chee concealed the fact that 
Yamamoto’s loan was repaid out of her partnership capital 
account, still accepted her personal check and used it for ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
12 
 purposes other than repaying the 401k loan; and (3) neither 
Chee nor [the Law Firm] have returned the funds, despite 
numerous demands from Yamamoto.  
 
Yamamoto, SDO at 4.  The ICA then examined whether these 
allegations “touched matters” covered by the Partnership 
Agreement.  Yamamoto, SDO at 4 (quoting Simula, 175 F.3d at 721 
(“To require arbitration, [Plaintiff’s] factual allegations need 
only ‘touch matters’ covered by the contract containing the 
arbitration clause . . . .”)).  The ICA concluded that they did; 
specifically, Yamamoto’s allegations regarding the handling of 
her Partnership capital account “touch[ed] matters” covered by 
the Partnership Agreement.  As such, the ICA held the circuit 
court did not err in concluding that the factual allegations in 
Yamamoto’s Complaint fell within the scope of the arbitration 
clause.  See Yamamoto, SDO at 5. 
For the foregoing reasons, the ICA affirmed the circuit 
court’s March 9, 2016 Order Compelling Arbitration.  Yamamoto, 
SDO at 9. 
III. Standards of Review 
A. Statutory Interpretation 
 Statutory interpretation  is a question of law reviewable de 
novo.  See Citizens Against Reckless Dev. v. Zoning Bd. of 
Appeals, 114 Hawai ʻi 184, 193, 159  P.3d 143, 152  (2007) (citation 
omitted).  When construing statutes, the court is governed by 
the following rules:  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
13 
 First, the fundamental starting point for statutory 
interpretation is the language of the statute itself. 
Second, where the statutory language is plain and 
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain 
and obvious meaning. Third, implicit in the task of 
statutory construction is our foremost obligation to 
ascertain and give effect to the intention of the 
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the 
language contained in the statute itself. Fourth, when 
there is doubt, doubleness of me
aning, or indistinctiveness 
or uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, an 
ambiguity exists.  
When there is ambiguity in a statute, “the meaning of 
the ambiguous words may be sought by examining the context, 
with which the ambiguous words, phrases, and sentences may 
be compared, in order to ascertain their true meaning.” 
Moreover, the courts may resort to extrinsic aids in 
determining legislative intent, such as legislative 
history, or the reason and spirit of the law.  
114 Hawaiʻi at 193
-94, 159 P.3d at 152-53 (citations omitted.) 
B. Motion to Compel Arbitration 
A motion to compel arbitration is reviewed de  novo and 
based on the same standard that applies to a summary judgment 
ruling.  See Koolau Radiology, Inc. v. Queen ’s Med. Ctr., 73 
Hawaiʻi 433, 440, 834 P.2d 1294, 1298 (1992) (“[W]e review this 
case [motion to compel arbitration] de novo, using the same 
standard employed by the trial court and based upon the same 
evidentiary materials as were before it in determination of the 
motion.” (citations, i nternal quotation marks, and alterations 
omitted)). 
C. Contract Interpretation  
As a general rule, the construction and legal effect to be 
given a contract is a question of law freely reviewable by 
an appellate court.  The determination whether a contract 
is ambiguous is likewise a question of law that is freely 
reviewable on appeal.  These principles apply equally to 
appellate review of the construction and legal effect to be 
given a contractual agreement to arbitrate.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
14 
 Brown v. KFC Nat’l Mgmt. Co. , 82 
Hawaiʻi 226, 239, 921 P.2d 146, 
159 (1996) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). 
IV. Discussion 
A. Arbitration must be initiated pursuant to HRS § 658A- 9 
prior to the f iling of a motion to compel arbitration under 
HRS § 658A-7. 
 
On certiorari, Yamamoto again argues that 
Ueoka, 107 Hawai ʻi 
386, 114 P.3d 892, mandates strict compliance with HRS § 658A-
9’s notice requirements.   According to Yamamoto, Defendants 
neither complied with the timing nor content of the notice 
requirements under the statute .  Defendants, on the other hand, 
reiterate that Yamamoto’s arguments as to notice are “form over 
substance,” as she does not assert she was uncertain as to why 
the e-mail and letter were sent, or for which claims arbitration 
was being sought.  Moreover, Defendants argue that requiring 
literal compliance with the arbitration initiation statute would 
produce an absurd and unjust result.    
Yamamoto correctly asserts that Ueoka  is instructive.  That
case involved the sale of real property from Okuno to Szymanski 
(“first contract”), and the immediate re -sale of the property by
Szymanski to Hartley (“second contract”).  See 107 Hawai ‘i at 
388, 114 P.3d at 894.  Both contracts contained arbitration 
provisions, and both sales hinged on, among other things, t
he 
installation of four water meters on the property.  When issues 
arose regarding the installation of the requisite water meters,  
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
15 
 Szymanski requested mediation, but Okuno refused and filed a 
complaint in circuit court.  See  107 Hawai ‘i at 389
, 114 P.3d at 
895.  Hartley then intervened in that case, to which Szymanski 
filed a statement of no position, and Hartley also separately 
filed a lawsuit against Okuno and Szymanski.  See  id.  Szymanski 
then filed a motion to stay all court proceedings initiated by 
Hartley pending arbitration, which was denied.  See  107 Hawai‘i 
at 391, 114 P.3d at 897. 
On appeal, this court clarified that HRS § 658A -9 applies 
to any party to an arbitration agreement that wishes to initiate 
arbitration, and is not limited to a party asserting a claim.  
See 107 Hawai ‘i a
t 395, 114 P.3d at 901.  We then rejected 
Szymanski’s arguments that he satisfied the notice requirements 
of HRS § 658A- 9 when he “demand[ed] arbitration in filing two 
circuit court documents: (1) his statement of no position on 
Hartley’s application to intervene, and (2) his motion to stay 
proceedings pending arbitration.”  Id.  We observed that 
“[w]hile those pleadings may demonstrate Szymanski’s intent to 
invoke arbitration, they do not satisfy the statutory 
requirements of HRS 
§ 658A-9 for the initiation of arbitration.”  
Id. 
We went on to analyze HRS § 658A- 7 (Supp. 2001 ), which 
governs motions to compel or stay arbitration, in pari ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
16 
 materia with HRS § 658A-9.  HRS § 658A
-7 states in relevant 
part: 
Motion to compel or stay arbitration.   (a) On motion of a 
person showing an agreement to arbitrate and alleging 
another person ’s refusal to arbitrate pursuant to the 
agreement:  
 
(1) If the refusing party does not appear or does not 
oppose the motion, the court shall order the parties to 
arbitrate; and  
 
(2) If the refusing party opposes the motion, the court 
shall proceed summarily to decide the issue and order the 
parties to arbitrate unless it finds that there is no 
enforceable agreement to arbitrate.  
 
HRS § 658A-7(a).  We concluded that “[i]n the absence of 
Szymanski’s satisfaction of those requirements for initiation of 
the arbitration proceeding, Hartley cannot be found to have 
refused to arbitrate,” and therefore the circuit court was not 
obligated to order arbitration.  
Ueoka, 107 Hawai‘i at 396, 114 
P.3d at 902. 
 Pursuant to these guiding principles, the circuit court 
erred in granting Defendants’ motion to compel.  At the time 
Defendants filed their motion, no letter had been issued by 
certified mail, no return receipt had been obtained, and 
therefore any allegations in the motion that Yamamoto had 
refused to arbitrate were baseless as a matter of law.  Further, 
to permit Defendants to “cure” the notice defect after Yamamoto 
had submitted her response to the motion to compel, as the ICA 
allowed, effectively restricted Yamamoto’s right to object in 
writing to the motion, especially because HRS § 658A-7(a) tasks ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
17 
 the court to “proceed summarily,” i.e., expeditiously,4 to decide 
the issue of arbitrability.  This goes to the heart of Ueoka ’s 
holding that a party “cannot be found to have refused to 
arbitrate” until the formal requir ements for initiating an 
arbitration are met. 
 The ICA’s reasoning that “requiring a motion to compel 
arbitration to be denied, a new demand to be made, and then a 
new motion to compel to be filed[] would be inconsistent with 
the policy considerations” enc ouraging arbitration recognized by 
this court, see Ueoka, 107 Hawaiʻ i at 395, 114 P.3d at 901, fails 
to consider that the formal mechanisms for initiating 
arbitration under HRS § 658A -9 are meant to systemically reduce 
litigation at the outset.  Yamamoto , SDO at 8- 9.  In other 
words, requiring the preliminary step of formally initiating 
arbitration pursuant to HRS § 658A-9 before filing an HRS § 
                     
4  Chapter 658 is based on the Uniform Arbitration Act (Unif. Law Comm’n 
2000).  See Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 115, in 2001 House Journal, at 1093 -94.  In 
a comment to the Uniform Arbitration Act, “summarily” is noted to have been 
defined to mean that a trial court should act expeditiously and without a 
jury trial to determine whether a valid arbitration agreement exists.”  Unif. 
Arbitration Act § 7 cmt. (citation omitted); see, e.g., Stenzel v. Dell, 
Inc., 870 A.2d 133, 139 (Me. 2005) (quoting id.); Netco, Inc. v. Dunn, 194 
S.W.3d 353, 362 (Mo. 2006), as modified on denial of reh’g  (June 30, 2006) 
(“Although this court has not expressly addressed the meaning of the term

are those that are conducted ‘without the usual formalities and without a 
jury.’” (quoting Black’s Law  Dictionary 1476 (8th ed. 1999) (brackets

 658A-7 motion is intended to reduce litigation, e.g., the filing 
of motions to compel or to stay arbitration in court.  Thus, 
permitting the filing of a motion to compel arbitration before 
the initiation of arbitration proceedings actually increases the 
amount of litigation in the courts.  Ueoka  recognized such 
considerations, noting that “[a]llowing a party to com pel 
arbitration after filing a lawsuit (without filing a notice 
initiating arbitration) does nothing to avoid litigation or 
reduce the number of cases crowding our courts.”   Ueoka, 107 
Hawaiʻi at 395, 114 P.3d at 901.
    
 Therefore, the ICA erred in affirm ing the circuit court’s 
order granting Defendants’ motion to compel despite Defendants’ 
failure to initiate arbitration pursuant to HRS 
§ 658A-9 before 
filing a motion to compel arbitration pursuant to HRS § 658A- 7. 
We therefore hold that the requirements of HRS § 658A- 9 
must be met before a party files a motion to compel arbitration.   
B. As the arbitration c lause does not encompass 
 Yamamoto’s  claims for c onversion, the ICA e rred in 
 affirming the circuit court’s order granting 
 defendants’ motion to compel arbitration.  
 
We next address whether Yamamoto’s claim falls within the 
scope of the Partnership Agreement’s arbitration clause.  On 
certiorari, Yamamoto takes issue with the ICA’s use of two cases 
to support its conclusion that her claims must be arbitrated:  
Simula, 175 F.3d 716, and Coffman, 161 F. Supp. 2d 720.  She ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
19 
 first argues that the ICA’s use of the “touch matters” test from 
Simula ignores another of Simula ’s requirements: for an 
arbitration clause, which employs “arising in connection with” 
language, to reach a dispute, that dispute must first have a 
“significant relationship to the contract” or “hav[e] [its] 
origin or genesis in the contract[,] ” citing Simula, 173 F.3d at 
721.   
Second, she points out that Coffman, 161 F. Supp. 2d 720, 
which the ICA cited to support its interpretation of the scope 
of the phrase “in connection with,” had also noted: “Just 
because the Partnership Agreements may be referred to as 
evidence, however, does not make Plaintiff’s . . . claims 
arbitrable.  Because Plaintiff’s . . . claims could be 
maintained independently of the contract, such claims do not 
fall within the scope of the arbitration clause.”  161 F. Supp. 
2d at 732 (citations omitted).  Yamamoto points out that Coffman  
further explained that the test in the Fifth Circuit is whether 
“the . . . claim was so interwoven with plaintiff’s rights under 
contract that plaintiff ‘could have just as easily alleged a 
breach of contract action.’”  Ford v. NYLCare Health Plans of 
Gulf Coast, Inc., 141 F.3d 243, 250 (5th Cir. 1998) (citation 
omitted).  Thus, in Coffman , which involved an employee of a law 
firm who had signed a partnership agreement containing an 
arbitration clause, the Texas federal district court determined ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
20 
 that the plaintiff’s breach of fiduciary duty claim was 
arbitrable because it could be re-labeled as a breach of 
contract action, whereas her claims for violation of Title VII 
were not arbitrable.  161 F. Supp. 2d at 733.  
 Yamamoto also argues that the ICA failed to consider the 
entire Partnership Agreement before determining the scope of the 
arbitration clause, contrary to Yogi v. Hawaii Med. Serv. Ass’n , 
124 Hawai ʻi 172, 238 P.3d 699 (App. 2010).
  In that case, after a 
patient successfully appealed to the Hawai ʻi Insurance 
Commissioner HMSA’s repeated denials of a preau thorization 
request for a medical procedure recommended by the patient’s 
physician, the patient brought suit for damages against HMSA, 
alleging that HMSA acted unreasonably, wantonly, and 
oppressively in denying the preauthorization request.  See  Yogi, 
124 Hawaiʻi at 174, 238 P.3d at 701.  HMSA sought to compel 
arbitration of patient’s claims, citing an arbitration clause 
contained in the patient’s medical plan with HMSA.  See id.  The 
ICA ultimately affirmed the circuit court’s denial of HMSA’s 
motion to compel arbitration.  See Yogi, 124 Hawaiʻ i at 17 8-79, 
238 P.3d at 705-06.  After examining the entire medical plan, 
the ICA construed the plan to mean that arbitration was an 
option that may be selected by a plan enrollee to challenge an 
HMSA determination;
 the other option was a review by a panel 
appointed by the Hawaiʻi Insurance Commissioner.  See  Yogi, 124 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
21 
 Hawaiʻi
 at 177, 238 P.3d at 704.  Because an Insurance 
Commissioner-appointed panel was not statutorily authorized to 
award money damages, the ICA reasoned the arbitration agreement 
likewise was not intended to encompass claims for money damages.  
See Yogi, 124 Hawai ʻi at 178, 238 P.3d at 705.  Alternatively, 
the ICA also commented that at best, the arbitration agreement 
was ambiguous, and that any ambiguity should be construed 
against HMSA as the drafter.  See  Yogi, 124 Hawaiʻ i at 179, 238 
P.3d at 706. 
As to the scope of the arbitration clause in this case, 
Defendants assert that Yamamoto’s conversion count  is not a 
“stand-alone claim” because “[w] hether Defendants must refund 
moneys to Plaintiff is only determined by whether Plaintiff 
actually overpaid her loan from the Law Firm,” which “can only 
be decided by examining the accounting entries in her capital 
account to verify whether the entries indicate or [do] not 
indicate the loan was repaid from moneys transferred from 
Plaintiff’s capital account.”   Defendants support the ICA’s 
broad interpretation of “in connection with,” [SC DOC 6:10] and 
interpret the Ninth Circuit’s Simula decision to mean th at “a 
direct nexus between the claims and the contract’s subject 
matter” is not required for claims to be arbitrable so long as 
the “claims ‘touch matters’ covered by that contract” containing 
the arbitration agreement.      ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
22 
  In Yamamoto’s reply, she emphasizes that the ICA’s decision 
essentially disregards an individual’s right to a civil jury 
trial in favor of a State policy that supports alternative 
dispute resolution.  Yamamoto suggests the ICA’s decision 
creates a slippery slope that will effectiv ely “chill acceptance 
of arbitration clauses, by impermissibly expanding [their] scope 
to include virtually any dispute neither covered by the 
agreement nor contemplated by the parties.”    
 To determine whether the Partnership Agreement’s 
arbitration clause encompasses Yamamoto’s claims for conversion, 
it is necessary to analyze the language of the arbitration 
clause and review Yamamoto’s allegations regarding Chee’s 
arrangement to transfer t he 401(k) accounts of the Law Firm’s 
employees to Chee’s financial advisor.   
The Partnership Agreement’s arbitration clause states, “In 
the event of any dispute between or among the Partners in 
connection with this Agreement, such disputed shall be resolved 
by arbitration . . . .”  As an initial matter, Yamamoto argued 
before the circuit court that because the clause applies only to 
“any dispute between or among the Partners,” the arbitration 
clause did not apply to Yamamoto’s complaint because she was not  
a Partner at the time of the alleged conversion.  Yamamoto’s 
claim did not arise until after she  was no longer a partner, and 
Chee took her personal check.  Yamamoto also argued before the ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
23 
 ICA that the arbitration clause did not apply because Chee’s 
arrangement was unrelated to the Partnership’s sole purpose of 
“rendering legal services and services ancillary thereto.”  We 
examine this issue further as “the construction and legal effect 
to be given a contract is a question of law freely reviewable by 
an appellate court.”  Brown, 82 Hawai ‘i at 239, 921 P.2d at 159.
 
Preliminarily, we note that the term “Partner” is 
capitalized in the arbitration clause.  The Partnership 
Agreement defines “Partner” as “each of the parties whose 
signatures appear at the end her eof.”  The recitals at the start 
of the Agreement state: 
This Partnership Agreement is executed with reference to 
the following:  
 
A.  Each of the parties hereto desires to form a 
limited liability law partnership  . . . . 
 
B.  Each of the parties further desires to set forth 
the terms and conditions for the conduct of the Partnership 
business. 
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, the 
parties hereby agree as follows: . . . .  
(Emphases added.)  Accordingly, each of the Articles in the 
Partnership Agreement, including the arbitration clause at 
Section 13.10, must be viewed in the light of the “premises” 
stated in the recitals, i.e., the arbitration clause must be 
read as a “term[] and condition[] for the conduct of the 
Partnership business.”  Furt her, as argued by Yamamoto, the 
Partnership Agreement’s “purpose” clause, Article 1.3, ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
24 
 specifically provides that “[t]he Partnership is organized 
solely for the purpose of rendering legal services and services 
ancillary thereto.” (Emphasis added.)    
 With these considerations in mind, there are two notable 
points when examining the arbitration clause, which states: “In 
the event of any dispute between or among the Partners in 
connection with this Agreement, such dispute shall be resolved 
by arbitration . . . .”  First, Yamamoto was a “Partner,” as she 
had signed the Partnership Agreement.  Second, her signature was 
affixed to the Partnership Agreement “to form a limited 
liability law partnership,” and to “set forth the terms and 
conditions for the conduct of the Partnership business.”  Thus, 
as “the Partnership business” was not to lend money or 
administer 401(k) plans, Chee’s arrangement falls outside “the 
Partnership business.”  Therefore, any claims arising from the 
arrangement do not comprise a “dispute .  . . in connection with 
this Agreement” and are therefore not subject to the arbitration 
clause.5   
The ICA’s SDO focused solely on the phrase “in connection 
with” without considering the context of the clause within the 
                     
5  The dissent highlights portions of Article III of the Partnership 
Agreement governing “capital accounts,” including a provision stating that 
upon withdrawal, a Partner would be entitled to only the amount in that 
Partner’s capital account.  Yamamoto’s complaint does not request relief 
regarding her capital account; rather she alleges conversion (Count I), 
fraudulent conversion (Count II), and punitive damages (Count III) based on 
the wrongful retention of the personal check she wrote to repay her 401(k) 
loan. ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
25 
 Partnership Agreement.  The arbitra tion clause applies “to the 
conduct of the Partnership business” as specified in the 
Partnership Agreement.
   
The ICA compared this case to Unidev
, 129 Hawai ‘i 378, 301 
P.3d 588, and concluded that just as the court found the claims 
in Unidev arbitrable , so, too, should Yamamoto’s claims be 
deemed arbitrable.  See  Yamamoto , SDO at 4 -5.  There, the court 
concluded that because the arbitration clause contained in one 
of the agreements between the parties (a housing project 
developer and the County of Hawai ‘i) “employed general language,” 
i.e., “any dispute arising under the terms of this Agreement,” 
“it may be inferred . . . that the parties did not intend to 
restrict the reach of the arbitration clause simply to claims 
involving construction or arbitration of the terms of the 
agreement.”  Unidev, 129 Hawai‘ i at 384, 394, 301 P.3d at 594, 
604.  Unidev, however, is inapposite because the Partnership 
Agreement here includes limiting language in its recitals such 
that the arbitration clause applies only “to the  conduct of the 
Partnership business.”  
Thus, although “any doubts concerning the scope of 
arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration,” 
“the mere existence of an arbitration agreement does not mean 
that the parties must submit to an arbitrator disputes which are 
outside the scope of the arbitration agreement.”  129 Hawai ‘i at ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 396, 301 P.3d at 606.  “An arbitration agreement is interpreted 
like a contract,” and “we have long expressed our disapproval of 
interpreting a contract such that any provision be rendered 
meaningless.”  129 Hawai ‘i at 395, 301 P.3d at 605.  The 
Partnership Agreement by its own terms limited the scope of its 
provisions, including the arbitration clause at section 13.10, 
to “the conduct of the Partnership business.”  Yamamoto’s claim 
is not based on the conduct of “Partnership business, ” which was 
“solely for the purpose of rendering legal services and services 
ancillary thereto.”   
Thus, the claims in Yamamoto’s complaint are not subject to 
the arbitration clause in the Partnership Agreement.  
V.  Conclusion 
 For these reasons, we vacate the ICA’s May 15, 2018 
Judgment on Appeal and the circuit court’s March 9, 2016 Order 
Compelling Arbitration.  This matter is remanded  to the circuit 
court for further proceedings consiste nt with this opinion.
