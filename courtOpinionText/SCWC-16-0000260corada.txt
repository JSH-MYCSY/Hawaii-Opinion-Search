ORDER OF CORRECTION
(By:  McKenna, J .)  
 
 IT IS HEREBY  ORDERED that the Opinion of the Court, 
filed March 2, 2020, is corrected as follows. 
 The first four sentences of page 5 of the opinion 
shall be corrected to read:  
Allegedly unaware that her Partnership capital 
account had already been debited $19,134.31 to repay the 
Law Firm, Yamamoto handed Chee a personal check payable to 
the Law Firm for the same amount.  Yamamoto allegedly told 
Chee that the check was to repay the firm as they had 
previously agreed.  Additionally, the memo line of the 
personal check allegedly read “401K loan repay.”  
Chee allegedly knew the Law Firm had already been 
repaid but allegedly concealed from Yamamoto that he had 
already debited Yamamoto’ s capital account in the amount of 
$19,134.31.
