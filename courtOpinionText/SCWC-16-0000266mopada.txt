 After a lengthy bench trial  before the Circuit Court of the 
Third Circuit (circuit court)  and some procedural complexities, 
Elder sought relief from the terms of the circuit court’s final 
judgment.  The circuit court denied Elder’s request and, on 
appeal, the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) held that it 
lacked jurisdiction over Elder’s claims.  However, a review of 
the record reveals that Elder properly raised his challenge to 
the circuit court’s ruling on his request for relief from 
judgment .  Because the ICA had jurisdiction over these claims, 
the ICA erred in affirming the circuit court’s ruling without 
addressing the merits of Elder’s claims.  This court therefore 
vacates in part the ICA’s judgment and remands this case to the 
ICA for further proceedings consistent with this memorandum 
opinion. 
I. BACKGROUND  
Elder and the Gundersons both own vacation  homes in 
The Bluffs at Mauna Kea (The Bluffs) in Kohala, Hawaiʻi.  
According to Elder, one of the attracting features of The Bluffs 
was a guarantee o f protected waterfront views for all property 
owners.  For roughly eight years, Elder and the Gundersons lived 
alongside one another in apparent harmony, until the Gundersons 
failed to trim their naupaka plants.  In particular, the 
Gundersons built a stone  wall along the Elder and Gundersons’ 
shared property line, and planted naupaka on the side of the ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
3 
 wall facing Elder so that Elder would not see the stone wall.  
The Gundersons also extended the naupaka plantings to form a 
hedge around their entire propert y.   
On March 22, 2011, Elder filed a complaint against the 
Gundersons and The Bluffs at Mauna Kea Community Association 
(the Community Association) in the circuit court .1  Elder 
asserted that the Gundersons’ naupaka plants blocked Elder’s 
“view of the oce an, the historic town of Puako and the South 
Kohala coast.”  Elder sought injunctive relief requiring the 
Gundersons to trim all of the naupaka plants  so that none grew  
taller than thirty feet .  The Gundersons  filed a number of 
counterclaims against Elder.  Both parties alleged, inter alia , 
that the other breached the Community Association’s governing 
documents.  After a lengthy bench trial, the circuit court 
issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and  Judgment on 
October 31, 2014.  As relevant here, the circuit court concluded 
that the Gundersons breached the governing documents by growing 
the naupaka plants taller than the border wall.  The circuit 
court consequently ordered that the “Gunderson[s are]  enjoined 
from maintaining the height of the naupaka above the height of 
the wall and [are] directed to reduce the height within one 
                     
1  The Honorable Elizabeth A. Strance presided over the matter from its 
initiation until March 2015.   
 
 The Honorable Ronald Ibarra presided over the matter thereafter . ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 hundred and twenty (120) days from the date of this order.”  The 
circuit court issued its corresponding Final Judgment on M arch 
16, 2015 (March 16, 2015 Judgment).   
Regarding Elder’s claims, the March 16, 2015 Judgment 
provided  in relevant part : 
JUDGMENT IS HEREBY ENTERED as follows:  
 
1. In favor of JERRY ELDER as to his breach of contract 
claim against ROBERT V. GUNDERSON, JR. and ANNE D. 
GUNDERSON and THE BLUFFS AT MAUNA KEA COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION 
for failing to maintain the naupaka at the height of the 
wall it fronts.  
The Gundersons appealed the circuit court’s judgment to the ICA.  
However, on July 24, 2015, the ICA dismissed the appeal for lack 
of jurisdiction because the circuit court did not resolve one of 
the Gundersons’ counter -claims.   
During the pendency of the appeal, the case was 
reassigned to  Judge Ronald Ibarra.   
On October 13, 2015, Elder filed a motion to enforce  
the March 16, 2015 Judgment in an attempt to compel the 
Gundersons to trim all2 of the Gundersons’  naupaka plants to the 
height of the border wall.  Both the Community Association  and 
the Gundersons responded by arguing that the March 16, 2015 
Judgment wa s limited to the naupaka plants adjacent to the 
border wall.   
                     
2  This request points to the heart of the dispute: whether the March 16, 
2015 Judgment r estricted the height of all of Gunderson’s naupaka plants or 
just the naupaka plants adjacent to the border wall.  ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
5 (continued . . .)  
 On December 17, 2015, following a hearing on Elder’s 
motion, the circuit court denied the motion and entered an 
amended final judgment (December 17, 2015 Judgment).  With 
respect to Elder’s cla ims, the December 17, 2015 Judgment 
provided  in relevant part : 
2. As to Count II (Breach of Contract, Breach of 
Governing Documents and Protective Covenants, Conditions 
and Restrictions), Judgment is entered in favor of Elder 
against the Gunderson s and The Bl uffs for failing to 
maintain the naupaka at the height of the wall it front s, 
pursuant to the FF/CL/Judgment at 26 ( ¶1).  In all other 
respects, judgment is entered in favor of The Bluffs and 
the Gundersons against Elder, pursuant to the 
FF/CL/Judgment at 26 (¶2). 
 
3. As to Count IX (Injunctive Relief), Judgment is 
entered in favor of Elder against the Gundersons as 
follows: The Gundersons are ORDERED to cut back the naupaka 
to the height of the adjacent wall between the Gundersons 
and Elder properties within 120 days of entry of the 
FF/CL/Judgment unless otherwise agreed by all parties in 
writing; and the Gundersons are ENJOINED from maintaining 
the height of the naupaka above the height of said wall, 
pursuant to the FF/CL/Judgment at 27 ( ¶¶8-9).  Judgment is 
entered in favor of Elder against The Bluffs; The Bluffs 
shall enforce these covenants pursuant to the Governing 
Documents, pursuant to the FF/CL/Judgment at 27 ( ¶12).  In 
all other respects, Judgment is entered in favor of The 
Bluffs and the Gundersons ag ainst Elder, pursuant to the 
FF/CL/Judgment at 26 ( ¶2). 
  On January 14, 2016, Elder filed a motion for relief 
from the December 17, 2015 Judgment pursuant to Hawaiʻi Rules of 
Civil Procedure ( HRCP) Rule 60(b)3 (Rule 60(b) Motion).  However, 
                     
3  HRCP Rule 60(b) ( 2006) provides  in relevant part : 
 
Mistakes; inadvertence; excusable neglect; newly discovered 
evidence; fraud, etc.   On motion and upon such terms as are 
just, the court may relieve a party or a party’s legal 
representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding 
for the following reasons: (1)  mistake, inadvertence, 
surprise, or excusable neglect; (2)  newly discovered 
 ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
6 (continued . . .)  
 Elder did not specify which of HRCP Rule 60(b)’s six possible 
bases provided a foundation for the Rule 60(b) Motion.4  As 
relevant here, Elder asserted that Judge Ibarra’s inclusion of 
the words “between the Gundersons and Elder properties” 
substantially changed the March 16, 2015 Judgment  by requiring 
the Gundersons to trim only the naupaka plants on the shared 
Gunderson and Elder property line.   
On March 10, 2016, the circuit court denied Elder’s 
Rule 60(b) Motion (March 10, 2016 Denial).   
On March 30, 2016, Elder fi led a notice of appeal to 
the ICA.  In his opening brief, Elder raised five issues: 
(1) whether Judge Ibarra erred by failing to comply with the 
requirement s of HRCP Rule 635; (2) whether Judge Ibarra erred by 
                     
evidence which by due diligence could not have been 
discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 
59(b); (3)  fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic 
or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an 
adverse party; ( 4) the judgment is  void; (5)  the judgment 
has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior 
judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or 
otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the 
judgment should have prospective application; or (6)  any 
other rea son justifying relief from the operation of the 
judgment.  The motion shall be made within a reasonable 
time, and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not more than one 
year after the judgment, order, or proceeding was entered 
or taken.  A motion under this subdi vision (b) does not 
affect the finality of a judgment or suspend its operation.  
4  Based upon the emphasis added to the quoted language of HRCP Rule 
60(b), Elder intended to base his motion on a mistake pursuant to HRCP Rule 
60(b)(1), an inequity pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b)(5), and /or any other reason 
justifying relief pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b)(6).  
 
5  HRCP Rule 63 ( 2000) provides:  
 ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
7 
 “substantially altering” the March 16, 2015 Ju dgment by 
including the words “between the Gundersons and Elder 
properties” in the December 17, 2015 Judgment; (3)  whether Judge 
Ibarra erred by “failing to recognize that the height limitation 
applies to the entire special setback area [;]” (4) whether the  
circuit court erred in holding that the Community Association 
could not be held liable; and (5)  whether the circuit court 
erred in holding that no party was a prevailing party.  In sum, 
issue 1, the HRCP Rule 63 claim,  challenged whether Judge Ibarra 
could exercise j urisdiction over Elder’s claims;  issues 2 and 3 , 
the Rule 60(b) claims,  disputed  Judge Ibarra’s ruling on the 
Rule 60(b) Motion ; and issues 4 and 5 , the direct challenges,  
contested the December 17, 2015 Judgment.  
During the ICA proceedings, th e Gundersons argued that  
the ICA could not exercise jurisdiction over Elder’s points of 
error.  In particular, the Gundersons asserted that Elder’s 
direct challenges to  the December 17, 2015 Judgment were 
untimely because the notice of appeal was filed mor e than thirty 
                     
 
If a trial or hearing has been commenced and the judge i s 
unable to proceed, any other judge may proceed with it upon 
certifying familiarity with the record and determining that 
the proceedings in the case may be completed without 
prejudice to the parties.  In a hearing or trial without a 
jury, the successor judge shall at the request of a party 
recall any witness whose testimo ny is material and disputed 
and who is available to testify again without undue burden.  
The successor judge may also recall any other witness.  ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

. . . . 
 
(continued . . .)  
 days after Judge Ibarra entered the December 17, 2015 Judgment  
and because the Rule 60(b) M otion did not toll the deadline for 
filing an appeal.  The ICA agreed that it lacked jurisdiction 
over Elder’s direct challenges.  Nevertheless, the IC A concluded 
that it could exercise jurisdiction over the Rule 60(b) claims .   
On October 31, 2019, the ICA issued a summary 
disposition order affirming the circuit court’s denial of 
Elder’s Rule 60(b) Motion.  After noting that the ICA had 
already dismisse d the direct challenges to the December 17, 2015 
Judgment , the ICA held that “Elder fail[ed] to raise any 
arguments pertaining to the Rule 60(b) Order over which [it 
possessed]  appellate jurisdiction.”  In particular, the ICA 
explained that Elder failed to  comply with Hawaiʻi Rules of 
Appellate Procedure  (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4)6 because his opening 
                     
6  HRAP Rule 28 (b)(4) ( 2016) provides  in relevant part : 
 
Opening Brief .  Within 40 days after the filing of the 
record on appeal, the appellant shall file an opening 
brief, containing the following sections in the order here 
indicated:  
 
. . . . 
 
(4) A concise statement of the points of error set forth 
in separately numbered paragraphs.  Each point shall state: 
(i) the alleged error committed by the court or agency; 
(ii) where in the record the alleged error occurred; and  
(iii) where in the record the alleged error was objected to 
or the manner in which the alleged error was brought to the 
attention of the court or agency.  .  . . 
 ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 brief did “not indicate where in the record or the manner in 
which [the points of error] were raised in the [c]ircuit 
[c]ourt.”  Additionally, the ICA concluded tha t “none of Elder’s 
arguments on appeal address the standards or requirements for 
relief under HRCP Rule 60(b) or why the [c]ircuit [c]ourt erred 
in entering the Rule 60(b) Order.”  Rather, the ICA determined 
that Elder’s opening brief “directly challenge[d ] Judge Ibarra’s 
entry of the [December 17, 2015 Judgment].”  The ICA did not 
explicitly address Elder’s HRCP Rule 63 argument.7 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW  
A. Subject Matter Jurisdiction  
“Whether a court possesses subject matter jurisdiction 
is a question of law reviewable de novo.”  Hawaii Mgmt. Alliance 
Ass’n v. Ins. Comm’r , 106 Hawaiʻi 21, 26, 100 P.3d 952, 957 
(2004) (citation omitted) . 
III.  DISCUSSION  
This court accepted this case to tend to the 
boundaries  of the co urts’ jurisdiction.  On certior ari, Elder 
presents two points of error: (1)  whether the ICA erred in 
affirming the March 10, 2016 D enial of his Rule 60(b) Motion , 
                     
Points not presented in accordance with this section 
will be disregarded, except that the appellate court, at 
its option, may notice a plain error not presented.  
7  The ICA nevertheless  noted that its “review of the record indicate[d ] 
that Elder only raised [issues 2 and 3] in his Rule 60(b) Motion.”   ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
10 
 and (2) whether the ICA erred in finding that Elder’s opening 
brief failed to comply with HRAP Rule 28(b )(4).  Although the 
ICA is correct that appellants are generally obligated to comply 
with the requirements of HRAP Rule 28(b)(4), the ICA erred in 
concluding that strict compliance is a necessity  for it to 
exercise jur isdiction in this case .  The ICA therefore possessed 
and should have exercised its jurisdiction over Elder’s 
challenges to the March 10, 2016 Denial.  Nevertheless, the ICA 
correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction over Elder’s 
remaining claims.  
A. The ICA erred in affirming the March 10, 2016 Denial 
without considering the merits of Elder’s  Rule 60(b) Motion  
arguments.  
HRAP Rule 28(b)(4)  requires appellants to provide in 
relevant part:  
A concise statement of the points of error set forth in 
separately numbered paragraphs.  Each point shall state: 
(i) the alleged error committed by the court or agency; 
(ii) where in the record the alleged error occurred; and 
(iii) where in the record the alleged error was objected to 
or the manner in which the alleged error was brought to the 
attention of the court or agency.  
 
. . . . 
 
Points not presented in accordance with this section 
will be disregarded, except that the appellate court, at 
its option, may notice a plain error not presented.  
Nevertheless, this court ha s long recognized the 
policy that litigants should be permitted to appeal and have 
their cases heard on the merits, where possible.  Marvin v. 
Pflueger , 127 Hawaiʻi 490, 496, 280 P.3d 88, 94 (2012) (quoting ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
11 
 Morgan v. Planning Dep ’t, Cnty. of Kauai, 104 Hawaiʻi 173, 180 -
81, 86 P.3d 962, 989 -90 (2004)).  “This is particularly so where 
the remaining sections of the brief provide the necessary 
information to identify the party’s argument.”  Id.  This is the 
case here.  
Elder’s brief as a whole provides sufficien t 
information for the court to identify Elder’s Rule 60(b) Motion 
argument s.  The ICA concluded that “Elder’s opening brief does 
not indicate where in the record or the manner in which these 
respective points were raised in the [c]ircuit [c]ourt.”  To the 
contrary, Elder cited his Rule 60(b) Motion in his Statement of 
the Case.  Elder also identified in his opening brief that he 
was appealing the March  10, 2016 D enial.  Notably, t his was 
sufficient for the ICA to  identify the issues and to  pinpoint 
precisel y where they were raised in the record, stating “ [o]ur 
review of the record indicates that Elder raised points [2] and 
[3] in his Rule 60(b) Motion.”   
Furthermore, Elder fully briefed the issue of whether 
Judge Ibarra abused his discretion in denying the Rule 60(b) 
Motion.  The ICA determined that “none of Elder’s arguments on 
appeal address the standards or requirements for relief under 
HRCP Rule 60(b) or why the [c]ircuit [c]ourt erred in entering 
the Rule 60(b) Order.”  However, as noted above, Elder’s Rule 
60(b) Motion contended that relief from the December 17, 2015 ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
12 
 Judgment was necessary because the judgment was based on a 
mistake of fact  and inequitable and because of other reasons 
justifying relief.  Elder’s opening brief supported this 
argument by asserting that the circuit court abused its 
discretion by “improperly alter[ing] trial Judge Strance’s 
[March 16, 2015] Judgment on Elder’s claims against the 
Gundersons.”  Elder further argued that the circuit court 
“fail[ed] to recognize that the height limitation established at 
trial and recognized in Judge Strance’s March 16, 2015 Final 
Judgment applie [d] to the entire special setback area.”  
Consequently,  Elder’s opening brief sufficiently addressed the 
requirements for relief under HRCP Rule 60(b) and  why the 
circuit court abused its discretion in denying the Rule 60(b) 
Motion.  In turn, the ICA possessed jurisdiction to address the 
merits of Elder’s Rule 60(b)  Motion claims because Elder 
“provide[d] the necessary information to identify [his] 
argument .”  See Marvin, 127 Hawaiʻi at 496, 280 P.3d at 94.  
B. The ICA correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction 
over Elder’s other challenges.  
1. Elder waived his argument regarding the circuit 
court’s failure to comply with HRCP Rule 63 . 
Elder waived his HRCP Rule 63 claim because he never 
raised it before  the circuit court .  “Generally, the failure to 
properly raise an issue at the trial level precludes a party 
from raising that issue on appeal.”  State v. Hoglund , 71 Haw. ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
13 
 147, 150, 785 P.2d 1311, 1313 (1990)  (citation omitted) .  A 
review of the record confirms that Elder did not argue that an 
HRCP Rule 63 certification was required before Judge Ibarra 
could rule on either Elder’s October 13, 2015 motion to enforce 
or his Rule 60(b) Motion.  In fact, it was Eld er who moved Judge 
Ibarra to exercise jurisdiction over the matter.  As this court 
has agreed, “‘[i]t will not do for a claimant to suppress his 
misgivings regarding [a decisionmaker’s ability to preside over 
a matter] while waiting anxiously to see whethe r the decision 
goes in his favor.’”  In re Water Use Permit Applications , 94 
Hawaiʻi 97, 122, 9 P.3d 409, 434 (2000) (quoting Power v. Federal 
Labor Relations Auth. , 146 F.3d 995, 1002 (D.C. Cir. 1998)).  
Under these circumstances , Elder waived his HRCP Rule 63 claim 
and the ICA did not err in holding that it lacked jurisdiction 
over the same.  Hoglund, 71 Haw. at 150, 785 P.2d at 1313.8 
2. Elder failed to timely appeal the December 17, 2015 
Judgment.  
On certiorari, Elder repeats his arguments directly 
challenging the December 17, 2015 Judgment.  Nevertheless, Elder 
does not dispute the ICA’s conclusion that Elder failed to 
                     
8  Given that  Elder waived his HRCP Rule 63 cl aim, Elder’s opening brief 
cannot provide sufficient information to identify where in the record he  
first raised the claim.  Elder conseque ntly cannot point to anywhere in the 
record where he asserted that Judge Ibarra was required to issue a 
certification pursuant to HRCP Rule 63.  Thus, although Elder provided 
sufficient information to salvage his appeal of the March 10, 2016 Denial, 
Elder’s briefing could not be  sufficient to preserve the HRCP Rule 63 claim.  
 ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
14 (continued . . .)  
 timely appeal the December 17, 2015 Judgment.  The ICA was 
correct.  
“An appellant’s failure to file a timely noti ce of 
appeal is a jurisdictional defect that can neither be waived by 
the parties nor disregarded by the court in the exercise of 
judicial discretion.”  Wong v. Wong , 79 Hawaiʻi 26, 29, 897 P.2d 
953, 956 (1995).  In general, a notice of appeal must be file d 
within thirty days of the entry of a final judgment.  HRAP Rule 
4(a)(1).9  The deadline may be tolled by the filing of certain 
                     
9  HRAP Rule 4(a) ( 2016) provides in relevant part:  
 
Appeals in civil cases.  
 
(1) Time and place of filing .  When a civil appeal is 
permitted by law, the notice of appeal shall be file d 
within 30 days after entry of the judgment or appealable 
order. 
 
. . . . 
 
(3) Time to appeal affected by post -judgment motions .  
If any party files a timely motion for judgment as a matter 
of law, to amend findings or make additional findings, for 
a new trial, to reconsider, alter or amend the judgment or 
order, or for attorney’s fees or costs, and court or agency 
rules specify the time by which the motion shall be filed, 
then the time for filing the notice of appeal is extended 
for all parties until 30 d ays after entry of an order 
disposing of the motion.  .  . . 
 
(4) Extensions of Time to File the Notice of Appeal . 
 
(A) Requests for Extensions of Time Before 
Expiration of the Prescribed Time .  The court or 
agency appealed from, upon a showing of good cause, 
may extend the time for filing a notice of appeal 
upon motion filed within the time prescribed by 
subsections (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this Rule.  
However, no such extension shall exceed 30 days past 
such prescribed time.  .  . . 
 ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
15 
 post-judgment motions.  HRAP Rule 4(a)(3).  Alternatively, the 
appellant may seek a thirty -day extension.  HRAP Rule 4(a)(4).  
As relevant here, an HRCP Rule 60(b) motion does not toll the 
deadline for filing a notice of appeal.  Compare HRAP Rule 
4(a)(1), with HRCP Rule 60(b) . 
Elder did not timely appeal the December 17, 2015 
Judgment, depriving the ICA of jurisdiction over any d irect 
challenge.  The circuit court entered its amended judgment on 
December 17, 2015.   Elder did not file any post -judgment motions 
that would toll the deadline to file a notice of a ppeal, nor did 
Elder request an extension.  Instead, Elder filed his non-
tolling HRCP Rule 60(b) Motion on January  14, 2016, twenty -eight 
days later.  Ultimately, Elder filed his notice of appeal to the 
ICA on March  30, 2016, 104  days after the December 17, 2015 
Judgment and well outside the thirty -day timeframe provided for 
by HRAP Rule 4(a)(1).  Elder consequently failed to timely 
appeal the December 17, 2015 Judgment and the ICA did not err in 
                     
(B) Requests for Extensions of Time After 
Expiration of the Prescribed Time .  The court or 
agency appealed from, upon a showing of excusable 
neglect, may extend the time for filing the notice of 
appeal upon motion filed not later than 30 days after 
the expiration of the time prescribed by subsections 
(a)(1) through (a)(3) of this Rule.  However, no such 
extension shall exceed 30 days past the prescribed 
time.  .  . . ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

concluding that it lacked jurisdiction over the related claims.   
See Wong, 79 Hawaiʻi at 29, 897 P.2d at 956.  
IV. CONCLUSION  
For the foreg oing reasons, the ICA erred in affirming 
the circuit court’s March 10, 2016 D enial without addressing the 
merits of Elder’s related claims.  However, the ICA did not err 
in determining that it lacked jurisdiction over Elder’s other
