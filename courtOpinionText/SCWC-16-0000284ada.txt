2 Petitioner/Plaintiff- Appellant Carol L. McKenna (McKenna) and 
Respondents/Defendants-Appellants Association of Apartment 
Owners of Elima Lani, Certified Management, Inc., Wells Fargo 
Bank, and Ross Andaloro (collectively, Defendants) relating to 
a dispute between the parties about water and mold damage to 
McKenna’s condominium.  At the close of an October 21, 2014 
settlement conference, at which McKenna was represented by 
counsel, the circuit court and the parties acknowledged that 
the parties had reached a settlement and went on the record to 
identify the “essential terms” of the agreement.  Thereafter, 
McKenna refused to sign the settlement documents.  McKenna has 
since represented herself pro se. 
On November 5, 2014, Respondents filed a motion to
enforce the settlement agreement (Motion to Enforce) in the 
Circuit Court of the Third Circuit (circuit court) and 
attached a proposed written settlement agreement and 
stipulation.  McKenna opposed the Motion to Enforce.   
After a November 24, 2014 hearing on the Motion to 
Enforce, McKenna filed a Motion for an Evidentiary Hearing.  
The circuit court denied McKenna’s Motion for an Evidentiary 
Hearing and issued an order granting D efendants’ Motion to 
Enforce.  
In its order, the circuit court found that the  
 
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
3 parties had entered into a binding settlement agreement at the 
settlement conference but that the proposed written settlement 
agreement contained terms beyond those that had been agreed to 
at the settlement conference.  The circuit court therefore 
struck those terms and created a revised settlement agreement.  
The circuit court entered a final judgment on March 10, 2016, 
dismissing all of McKenna’s claims with prejudice.  
The Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) affirmed the 
circuit court’s final judgment.  McKenna filed an application 
for writ of certiorari. 
Genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether 
the parties reached a valid settlement agreement and as to 
which terms the parties agreed to at the settlement 
conference.  As such, pursuant to the ICA’s holding in Miller 
v. Manuel, 9 Haw. App. 56, 64, 828 P.2d 286, 292 (App. 1991), 
the circuit court should have granted McK enna’s motion for an 
evidentiary hearing to resolve these issues.  Instead, the 
circuit court revised the proposed settlement agreement itself 
before issuing an order enforcing the revised settlement 
agreement. 
We therefore vacate the ICA’s September 17, 2 018 
Judgment on Appeal.  We remand the case to the circuit court 
with instructions that the circuit court hold an evidentiary  
 
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
4 hearing and for further proceedings consistent with this 
opinion.  
I.  BACKGROUND 
At the outset of this dispute, McKenna was the owner 
and occupier of a condominium unit at Elima Lani in South 
Kohala, Hawai ʻi.  Association of Apartment Owners of Elima 
Lani Condominiums
, a Hawaii Nonprofit Corporation (AOAO) was 
the governing body of the condominium complex that includes 
McKenna’s condominium .  Certified Management, Inc. dba 
Certified Hawaii (Certified Management), was the managing 
agent of the Elima Lani condominiums.  Ross Andaloro owned the 
condominium above McKenna’s.  Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. was the 
previous owner of Ross Andaloro’s condominium.    1
In June 2010, McKenna returned home to discover 
extensive water damage in her condominium, which appeared to 
have been caused by a leak in the unit above hers (Ross 
Andaloro’s unit).  McK enna alleged that she contacted AOAO to 
address the leak, but that AOAO did not endeavor to fix the 
leak or enable McKenna to do so.   Several months later, 
McKenna identified mold in her condominium and she began to 
                                                 
1 McKenna claims that “[d]uring the period of time that the leak in 
[the] Andaloro unit was causing water to accumulate in the ceiling cavities 
of [McKenna’s] unit . . . the Andaloro  unit was owned by or in the possession 
of Wells Fargo” and that during that time, Wells Fargo was attempting to sell 
the unit to Andaloro, who at some point did purchase the unit.

5 suffer symptoms associated with exposure to contaminants.  
McKenna claimed that she was forced to vacate her condominium 
due to the mold contamination.  On December 20, 2011, McKenna 
filed a Complaint in the circuit court against Defendants 
alleging, inter alia, negligence and misrepresentation.   
Over the following two years, the parties engaged in 
two mediation sessions and arbitration.   
A. Circuit Court Proceedings   2
1. Settlement Conference Terms 
On October 21, 2014, McKenna attended a settlement 
conference with Defendants.  At the close of the conference, 
the parties went on the record,  acknowledged that they had 
reached a settlement, and  described the “essential terms” of 
the agreement.  McKenna agreed to the terms in the following 
exchange:  
THE COURT: Okay. And my understanding is that the 
parties have reached a settlement agreement in this case. 
That the terms of the settlement include – the essential 
terms of the settlement agreement are that the defendants 
shall pay plaintiff $60,000 in cash.  The Association of 
Apartment Owners of Elima Lani will also release any lien 
and outstanding amounts owed by Ms. McKenna to the 
association.  
That there be – it’s a general -damages- only release, 
and that the parties will execute a settlement agreement 
with mutual releases and standard settlement terms and a 
dismissal of the case.  
Have I accurately stated the settlement agreement 
from the perspective of the plaintiff, [McKenna’s 
counsel] ?
 
                                                 
2 The Honorable Melvin H. Fujino presided over entry of the Final 
Judgment.  The Honorable Elizabeth A. Strance presided over all other 
proceedings.  
 
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
6  
[MCKENNA’S COUNSEL]: Yes, your Honor.  
 
THE COURT: And Ms. McKenna, do you agree to the 
terms of the settlement?  
 
MS. MCKENNA: Yes.  
 
THE COURT: Okay. And [Wells Fargo’s counsel], have I 
accurately stated the settlement agreement from the 
perspective of your client, Wells Fargo?  
 
[WELLS FARGO’S COUNSEL]: Yes, your Honor.  
 
THE COURT: And do you have authority on behalf of 
your client to enter into the settlement agreement?  
 
[WELLS FARGO’S COUNSEL]: I do, your Honor.  
 
THE COURT: Okay. And [AOAO’s counsel], have I 
accurately stated the settlement agreement from the 
perspective of the association and of Certified 
Management?  
 
[AOAO’S COUNSEL]: One clarification, your Honor. 
It’s a dismissal with prejudice.  
 
THE COURT: Yes.   
 
The parties agreed that Wells Fargo’s counsel would draft a 
written settlement agreement reflecting the terms described 
and circulate it within fourteen days.  All parties stipulated 
that the circuit court could retain jurisdiction to enforce 
the settlement agreement.   
2. The Proposed Settlement Agreement 
Wells Fargo’s counsel thereafter circulated a 
proposed settlement agreement to the parties, including 
McKenna’s attorney.  McKenna instructed her attorney not to 
sign anything on her behalf, as she did not agree to the 
settlement terms.  McKenna did not sign the settlement  
 
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
7 documents. 
McKenna’s attorney filed a motion to withdraw as 
counsel on October 27, 2014, citing McKenna’s refusal to sign 
settlement documents.  The circuit court granted the motion.  
McKenna has proceeded pro se since her counsel’s withdrawal.  
Defendants filed their Motion to Enforce on November 
5, 2014.  Defendants requested that the motion be granted  
and that an Order enter herein enforcing the terms and 
conditions of the settlement reached by Plaintiff and the 
Defendants at the Settlement held on October 21, 2014 and 
requiring Plaintiff to execute the Settlement Agreement 
and Stipulation and or otherwise permitting the Clerk of 
Court, pursuant to Rule 10(e) of the Rules of the Circuit 
Courts of the State of Hawaii , to sign the 
Stipulation . .  . .  
 
On November 14, 2014, McKenna filed an opposition to 
Defendants’ Motion to Enforce.  McKenna attached a declaration 
to her opposition in which she claimed that, essentially, her 
verbal assent to the settlement conference terms was invalid.  
McKenna asserted,  
I was told during the settlement conference multiple times 
by [the circuit court] “It is not about the merits of the 
case, you cannot afford $100,000 to go to trial.”  During 
the same conversation I replied to [the circuit court] 
directly this ca
se is well documented and I feel confident 
presenting emails and professional reports to professional 
witnesses pro -se. [The circuit court] replied to me I 
could not afford the professional witnesses.  
 
McKenna also stated that “[t]owards the end of the set tlement 
conference when we were between $30- $60K, I was feeling sick 
[and] asked to leave and was told no, I could not by [the 
circuit court].”    
 
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
8 The circuit court held a hearing on Defendants’ 
Motion to Enforce on November 24, 2014.  At the hearing, 
McKenna argued that there had been no meeting of the minds at 
the settlement conference, that the settlement agreement 
lacked essential terms about repairing her condominium, that 
the proposed settlement agreement contained terms she had not 
agreed to, and that the settlement was invalid because the 
parties did not attend the settlement conference but sent 
attorneys in their stead.   After confirming that each 
Defendant had given full settlement authority to their 
attorney, the circuit court granted the Motion to Enforce, 
finding that there was a meeting of the minds as to the 
essential terms of the settlement.   However, the circuit court 
found that the settlement agreement contained terms beyond 
what had been agreed to at the settlement conference.  The 
circuit court stated: 
So the court will grant the motion to enforce 
settlement. With respect to the specific settlement 
agreement, the court will take the matter under advisement 
as to what, uh, it will, uh, allow a clerk to enter. Um, 
the court will not be going o
utside the terms of the 
settlement. Uh, there were no agreements regarding non -
disparagement and things of that ilk.  
So the court will look carefully at the, uh, 
settlement agreement and/or, uh, issue something separate 
from, uh, what is submitted to the court. But with respect 
to the essential terms, the court finds that they were 
agreed upon and will, uh, grant the motion to enforce 
settlement.  
 
Defendants submitted a proposed order granting their  
 
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
9 Motion to Enforce.  McKenna filed a motion objecting to the 
proposed order.  Therein, McKenna claimed that the terms of 
the proposed settlement agreement were different from those 
she agreed to at the settlement conference.   
In her motion, McKenna reiterated that, for several 
reasons, her assent to the settlement conference terms was 
invalid.  For example, McKenna argued that the circuit court 
compelled McKenna to settle when th e circuit court “improperly 
introduced [the] confidential Mediation amount as a starting 
point for settlement negotiations . . . said [McKenna] could 
not leave when [she] asked to go [and] repeatedly insisted 
[McKenna] could not afford to go to trial or afford [] expert 
witnesses.”  McKenna also contended that she had not been 
present at the drafting of the proposed settlement agreement, 
that she was “coerced, and under duress” at the settlement 
conference, and that she “never agreed at the October 21, 2014  
Settlement Conference to all the Material and Essential Terms 
and Conditions as described and enumerated in the [proposed 
settlement agreement][.]”  Defendants opposed the motion.   
McKenna filed a Motion for an Evidentiary Hearing on 
December 2, 2014.  Therein, McKenna argued that genuine issues 
of material fact were present and that as the circuit court 
should view motions to enforce settlement agreements by the  
 
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
10 same standard as motions for summary judgment, she was 
entitled to an evidentiary hearing.   
On February 6, 2015, the circuit court held a 
hearing on McKenna’s Motion for an Evidentiary Hearing.  At 
the hearing, the circuit court found that the motion was 
essentially a motion to reconsider the court’s oral grant of 
Defendants’ motion to enforce, f or which an order had not yet 
been issued.  Accordingly, the circuit court denied McKenna’s 
Motion for an Evidentiary Hearing:  
The Court will deny the motion to order evidentiary 
hearing, finding that the motion is essentially a motion 
to reconsider the motion to enforce settlement for which 
an order has not been issued.  
To the extent that the parties are requesting 
further ruling of the Court, the Court finds that the 
settlement conference that was held on October 21st, 2014, 
was an arm’s length settlement  conference. 
All parties were represented by counsel. The Court 
satisfied itself that all counsel had authority of their 
clients, if their client was not here, that they had the 
appropriate authority to act. The Court was satisfied that 
the defense counsel  had authority.  
To that end then, the Court conducted extensive 
settlement conferences in which Ms. McKenna was a full and 
active participant [] with her attorney. As the result of 
that lengthy settlement conference, a settlement agreement 
was reached, the material terms of which were placed on 
the record.  
Based upon the record before it, the Court can find 
no misconduct on the part of any defense counsel based 
upon their conduct and representations that were made 
during the course of the settlement conference and in 
terms of their conduct since.  
To the extent that no settlement agreement has been 
executed, that [sic] Court finds that that lays squarely 
in the lap of Ms. McKenna. Ms. McKenna indicated, shortly 
after the settlement conference, her intention not to 
execute a settlement agreement. As a result of that, her 
attorney filed a motion to withdraw as counsel. That 
motion was granted.  
Prior to the withdrawal of counsel, it would have 
been inappropriate, and that would have been attorney 
misconduct had either, any counsel attempted to contact  
 
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
11 and negotiate directly with Ms. McKenna regarding any 
matter relating to settlement.  In large part, the motion 
to order evidentiary hearing is attempts [sic] to either 
reargue the underlying merits of the case, which Ms. 
McKenna gave up in reaching a settlement in this case, or 
were previously covered during the motion to enforce 
settlement.  
For all of those reasons, the motion to order 
evidentiary hearing is denied.  
 
The circuit court entered a written order de nying McKenna’s 
Motion for an Evidentiary Hearing on March 4, 2015 (Order 
Denying Motion for Evidentiary Hearing).   
3. Revised Settlement Agreement Terms 
On February 6, 2015, the circuit court entered an 
order granting Defendants’ Motion to Enforce (Order  Granting 
Motion to Enforce).  The circuit court found that “[t]he 
parties herein entered into a binding settlement agreement 
during a settlement conference held on October 21, 2014.”  The 
circuit court also found that “[t]he [proposed settlement 
agreement] submitted to [McKenna] contains terms beyond the 
material terms of the Settlement Agreement.”  The circuit 
court accordingly struck the following provisions of the 
Settlement and Release Agreement:  
a. Paragraph 4 Attorneys’ Fees: All language after “The 
Settling Parties shall bear their respective attorneys’ 
fees and costs incurred in the Lawsuit.  
b. Paragraph 5, Non -Disparagement shall be stricken in 
its entirety.  
c. Paragraph 6, Release by Plaintiff, [] all language 
after the word “Lawsuit”.  
d. Paragraph 8, Release of Unknown Claims shall be 
stricken in its entirety.  
e. Paragraph 11, Indemnification [] all language after 
SAC is stricken.  
f. Paragraph 12(c) Acknowldgment [sic] . Inasmuch as *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
12 Plaintiff has refused to participate in the drafting of 
the Settlement Agreement, she cannot be deemed drafter.  
g. Paragraph 13. Tax Consequences shall be stricken in
its entirety.
h. Paragraph 18, Further Assurances shall be stricken in
its entirety.
The circuit court ordered that Defendants revise the proposed 
settlement agreement in conformity with the stricken 
provisions (revised settlement agreement) and submit it to the 
circuit court for execution by the Clerk of Court.  The 
circuit court also ordered that Defendants submit the 
stipulation for dismissal with prejudice to the circuit court 
for execution by the Clerk of Court.   Defendants submitted the 
revised settlement agreement and the stipulation for 
dismissal.  The case was dismissed on March 16, 2015.   The 
circuit court entered a Final Judgment in favor of Defendants 
on March 10, 2016.   3
B. ICA Proceedings
McKenna filed a notice of appeal on March 31, 2016.  
McKenna appealed: (1) the February 6, 2015 Order Granting 
Motion to Enforce; (2) the March 4, 2015 Order Denying Motion 
for an Evidentiary Hearing;  and (3) the circuit court’s March 
10, 2016 Final Judgment.  McKenna argued, inter  alia, that the 
3 McKenna filed various unsuccessful motions attempting to appeal 
the stipulation for dismissal and restore the proceedings.  McKenna also 
filed an appeal to the ICA, which was dismissed for lack of appellate 
jurisdiction.  Meanwhile, McKenna’s former counsel moved for distribution of 
settlement proceeds, which the circuit court granted. 
 
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
13 settlement agreement was not executed voluntarily, that the 
circuit court rewrote the settlement agreement such that it 
was materially different than the settlement agreement 
originally drafted by Defendants, and that there was no mutual 
assent or meeting of the minds at the settlement conference.   
In the Defendants’ answering brief, they argued that 
there was a meeting of the minds as to the terms of the 
settlement agreement and that McKenna suffered no prejudice by 
her failure to personally participate in drafting a written 
settlement agreement.  Defendants also argued that the circuit 
court used its “inherent power to modify the written 
agreement” and “revised the written settlement agreement to 
delete provisions not expressly agreed upon at the settlement 
conference.”   
On June 29, 2018, the ICA entered a Summary 
Disposition Order (SDO) affirming the circuit court.  McKenna 
v. Ass’n of Apartment Owners of Elima Lani , NO. CAAP -16-284, 
2018 WL 3199233 (App. June 29, 2018).  The ICA reasoned that 
as McKenna “does not dispute that the October 21, 2014 
Settlement Offer was orally accepted by [her] at that 
proceeding,” there was “no indication that McKenna did not 
intend to be bound to the resulting judgment or dismissal with 
prejudice.  Therefore, the agreeme nt was entered into  
 
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
14 voluntarily and there was a meeting of the minds, and a 
binding settlement agreement was formed.”  The ICA further 
held that the revised settlement agreement “did not materially 
change the essential terms agreed to at the Settlement 
Conference, and in fact, included several edits to assure that 
the agreement was not outside the scope of what was 
discussed.”   
The ICA entered its Judgment on Appeal on September 
17, 2018.  McKenna filed an application for writ of 
certiorari.  
II.  STANDARD OF REVIEW 
A motion to enforce a settlement agreement is 
reviewed by the same standard as a motion for summary 
judgment.  Miller, 9 Haw. App. at 64, 828 P.2d at 292.  We 
review the grant or denial of a motion for summary judgment 
“de novo under the same standard applied by the circuit 
court.”  Dairy Rd. Partners v. Island Ins. Co., 92 Hawai i 398, 
411, 992 P.2d 93, 106 (2000).  Summary judgment is appropriate 
if “there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and [] 
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  
Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 56(c).  
Accordingly, granting a motion to enforce a settlement 
agreement is appropriate if “there [is] no genuine issue of  
 
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
15 material fact and [] as a matter of law the parties [] entered 
into a valid compromise agreement.”  Miller, 9 Haw. App. at 
64, 828 P.2d at 292.  
III.  DISCUSSION 
McKenna raises the following questions on 
application for writ of certiorari: 
1. Whether the ICA gravely erred in holding that McKenna 
had a meeting of the minds as to the October 21, 2014 
original agreement?  
 
2. Whether the trial court ’s revisions of the original 
draft agreement and enforcement of the new and revised 
court ordered agreement was proper over McKenna ’s 
objection and lack of consent.  
 
We interpret McKenna ’s application as  arguing that 
the circuit court erred in enforcing the revised settlement 
agreement without granting McKenna ’s motion for an evidentiary 
hearing, in light of the genuine issues of material fact 
expressed in McKenna ’s questions on certiorari.   We agree 
that McKenna raises genuine issues of material fact as to the 
validity of her assent to the settlement agreement and as to 
the terms agreed to at the October 21, 2014 settlement.  4
                                                 
4 While McKenna does not explicitly contend that the circuit court 
improperly denied her motion for an evidentiary hearing, McKenna references 
the circuit court’s erroneous failure to conduct an evidentiary hearing 
multiple times in her application.   Moreover, McKenna challenged the order 
denying her motion for an evidentiary hearing in her August 7,  2016 Opening 
Brief to the ICA.  Because McKenna is  a pro se litigant, we construe her 
arguments liberally.  See Waltrip v. TS Enters., Inc., 140 Hawai i 226, 231, 
398 P.3d 815, 820 (2016).  Accordingly, we construe McKenna’s argument to be 
that the circuit court erroneously denied her motion for an evidentiary 
hearing.  We consider the issue preserved.   
 
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
16 Because the standard for granting a m otion to enforce a 
settlement agreement is the same standard that governs the 
grant or denial of a motion for summary judgment , the circuit 
court erred in granting Defendants’  Motion to Enforce when 
genuine issues of material fact exist.  The evidentiary 
hearing requested by McKenna will allow a full record to be 
developed to answer the questions raised in McKenna’s 
application. 
In Miller, the ICA held that an order granting a 
motion to enforce a settlement agreement is reviewed by the 
same standard as 
that of a motion for summary judgment.  9 
Haw. App. at 64, 828 P.2d at  292.  As such, “the question is 
whether the evidence presented to the trial court indicated 
that there was no genuine issue of material fact and that as a 
matter of law the parties had entered into a valid compromise 
agreement.”  Id.   The ICA further held that the circuit court 
must hold an evidentiary hearing if genuine issues of material 
fact exist regarding the validity of a settlement agreement.  
Id. at 64 -65, 828 P.2d at 292.  If, at the hearing, the 
circuit court determines that there was no valid settlement 
agreement, the circuit court should set the case for trial on 
the merits.  Id. at 71, 828 P.2d 295.  
Miller involved a contested settlement agreement  
 
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
17 concerning a dispute to quiet title to interests in real 
property on the island of Hawai i.  Id. at 59, 828 P.2d at 289.  
There, an agreement was reached at a settlement conference, 
and a hand-written memorandum was executed by all parties.  
Id. at 59-60, 828 P.2d at 289.  Subsequently, certain parties 
filed a motion to enforce settlement and attached a copy of 
the hand-written agreement and a stipulation, the terms of 
which differed from those of the agreement.  
Id. at 60, 828 
P.2d at 290.  The motion requested that the court enter an 
order approving the stipulation, or in the alternative, enter 
a judgment enforcing the agreement’s terms.  Id.  The circuit 
court granted the motion and entered an order enforcing 
certain terms of the stipulation and the agreement.  Id. at 
61, 828 P.2d 290.  The parties contesting the stipulation 
filed a motion asking the court to reconsider the order and to 
hold an evidentiary hearing, which the circuit court later 
denied.  Id. 
In vacating the circuit court’s decision, the ICA  
concluded that the enforcement of a settlement agreement must 
be treated like a motion for summary judgment.  Id.  at 64, 828 
P.2d at 292.  The ICA stated,  
[S]ince very important rights are at stake in most cases, 
appellate courts must strive to ensure that the purported 
compromise agreement sought to be enforced is truly an 
agreement of the parties.  A motion to enforce a 
settlement contract is neither ordinary nor  
 
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
18 routine . . . . Its relative simplicity is a concession to 
the policy favoring settlements,  but only to the extent 
that full and fair opportunities to prove one’s points are 
substantially preserved.  
 
Id. at 63, 828 P.2d at 291 (internal quotations omitted).  
Evaluating the settlement agreement by a summary judgment 
standard, the ICA held that genuine issues of material fact 
remained and that the circuit court should have set the case 
for trial on the merits or ordered an evidentiary hearing on 
the validity of the settlement agreement.  Id. at 64-65, 828 
P.2d at 292.  Noting that discrepancies existed between the 
hand-written agreement terms and the stipulation terms, the 
ICA held that those discrepancies per
 se created a genuine 
issue as to whether there was a meeting of the minds regarding 
the terms of either document.  Id. at 67, 828 P.2d at 293.  
We adopt the ICA’s analysis in Miller because it is 
consistent with Hawai i law and that of other jurisdictions, 
and because public policy favors this approach.  “ [S]ummary 
judgment is proper where the moving party demonst
rates that 
there is no genuine issue of material fact and it is entitled 
to judgment as a matter of law.”  Kaneohe Bay Cruises, Inc. v. 
Hirata, 75 Haw. 250, 258, 861 P.2d 1, 6 (1993).  In the

19 Rule 56(d).  Because enforcing a disputed settlement similarly 
involves summarily adjudicating a case, it is consistent with 
our courts’ summary judgment practices that the trial court  
deny a motion to enforce a settlement where genuine issues of 
material fact exist surrounding the settlement.  In this 
matter, because McKenna requested an evidentiary hearing and 
not an immediate trial, the circuit court should have, at a 
minimum, held an evidentiary hearing on whether a valid 
settlement agreement existed.  If the circuit court found that 
no valid settlement agreement existed, it then could have 
proceeded to a trial on the merits of the underlying lawsuit. 
Other jurisdictions also treat motions to enforce 
settlement as motions for summary judgment and 
have held that 
courts are required to hold an evidentiary hearing to resolve 
genuine issues of material fact before granting a motion for 
summary judgment.  For example, the Nevada Supreme Court held 
in Resnick v. Valente, 637 P.2d 1205, 1206 (Nev. 1981), that 
an alleged settlement agreement could not be summarily reduced 
to judgment upon the motion of one party without an 
evidentiary hearing.  The federal courts have also adopted 
this practice.  The United States Court of Appeals for the 
Ninth Circuit stated that “[w]here material facts concerning 
the existence or terms  of an agreement to settle are in

20 dispute, the parties must be allowed an evidentiary hearing.”  
Callie v. Near, 829 F.2d 888, 890 (9th Cir. 1987) (emphasis in 
original). 
We adopt the process of allowing an evidentiary 
hearing instead of immediately scheduling the matter for trial 
on the underlying claims based on the public policy supporting 
the enforcement of settlement agreements.  See  State Farm Fire 
and Cas. Co. v. Pac. Rent- All, Inc., 90 Hawai i 315, 323, 978 
P.2d 753, 761 (1999).  This public policy position 
underpins 
the procedural distinction between the denial of a motion to 
enforce a settlement and the denial of a motion for summary 
judgment.  Whereas, when genuine issues of material fact 
preclude the grant of summary judgment, the circuit court must 
set the case for trial on the merits,  see HRCP Rule 56(d), 
when genuine issues of material fact as to the terms or 
validity of a settlement agreement preclude the enforcement of 
that agreement, the circuit court may hold an evidentiary 
hearing to address those genuine issues in lieu of proceeding 
directly to trial on the merits.  See Miller, 9 Haw. App. at 
63, 828 P.2d at 291.  Because the policy supporting settlement 
should not be invoked at the expense of depriving litigants of 
the full and fair opportunity to have a trial on the merits, 
however, the circuit court should set a matter for trial on

21 (continued. . .)  the merits if it concludes at an  evidentiary hearing that the 
parties did not enter into a valid settlement agreement.  
In light of the foregoing, we hold that a trial 
court errs in granting a motion to enforce a settlement 
agreement when genuine issues of material fact exist regarding 
the existence and terms of the settlement agreement.  See  id. 
at 64, 828 P.2d at 292.  We further hold that the circuit 
court must, at minimum, hold an evidentiary hearing as to 
those genuine issues of fact.  
As settlement agreements are contracts, Dowsett v. 
Cashman, 2 Haw. App. 77, 83, 625 P.2d 1064, 1068 (App. 1981), 
however, the traditional requirements for contract formation 
must be met for an enforceable settlement to exist.  Carson v. 
Saito, 53 Haw. 178, 182, 489 P.2d 636, 638 (1971) (“We have 
held that 'the parties not having reached agreement upon all 
of the essential and material terms, conditions or covenants 
of the agreement, the
re was failure of mutual assent or a 
meeting of the minds and therefore no binding contract. ”)  At 
the evidentiary hearing requested by McKenna, the circuit 
court must therefore determine whether there was a meeting of 
the minds as to essential and material terms.    5

22 Here, McKenna adequately refuted Defendants’ 
allegation that there was no genuine issue of material fact.  
“The moving party in a summary judgment proceeding has the 
obligation to show . . . that there is no genuine issue of 
material fact.”  Miller, 9 Haw. App. at 65, 828 P.2d at 292.  
Once the moving party has satisfied its burden, “the opposing 
party must come forward, through affidavit or other evidence, 
with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue of 
material fact.”  Id.  However, “the alleged facts and the 
inferences logically drawn therefrom must be viewed in the 
light most favorable to the non- moving party.”  Id. 
Defendants’ Motion to Enforce simply alleged that 
the parties entered into a binding settlement agreement at the 
settlement conference and attached the proposed settlement 
agreement and stipulation for dismissal.  McKenna attached a 
declaration to her opposition to Defendants’ Motion to Enforce 
asserting that (1) the proposed settlement terms were 
different than the settlement conference terms, and that, (2) 
due to certain factors, her verbal assent to the settlement 
                                                 
When the parties to a bargain sufficiently defined to be a  
contract have not agreed with respect to a term which is 
essential to a determination of their rights and duties, a 
term which is reasonable in the circumstances is supplied 
by the court.

23 conference terms was invalid.   
McKenna argues, and we agree, that viewed in the 
light most favorable to McKenna, there exist genuine issues of 
material fact regarding the existence and terms of the 
settlement agreement.  First, McKenna raises a genuine issue 
of material fact as to the validity of her assent to the 
settlement conference terms.  “Whether or not the parties 
entered into an agreement is essentially a question of fact.”  
Island Directory Co. v. Iva’s Kinimaka Enters., Inc. , 10 Haw. 
App. 15, 23, 859 P.2d 935, 940 (App. 1993).  In McKenna’s 
declaration attached to her opposition to Defendants’ Motion 
to Enforce, McKenna claimed that, essentially, her verbal 
assent to the settlement conference terms was invalid because 
she was ill at the settlement conference and was not allowed  
to leave.   She also stated that the circuit court coerced her 
into settling by 
repeatedly insisting that she could not 
afford to go to trial.   These claims call into question, and 
thus demonstrate a genuine issue as to, the validity of 
McKenna’s assent at the settlement conference.  
Second, like the discrepancy between the stipulation 
and agreement alleged in Miller, here the terms of the 
proposed settlement agreement differed from the settlement 
conference terms.  The proposed settlement agreement contained  
 
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
24 twelve provisions not placed on the record at the settlement 
conference: (1) attorneys’ fees, (2) warranties and 
representations, (3) indemnification, (4) acknowledgments, (5) 
compromise of disputed claims, (6) severability, (7) binding 
effect, (8) governing law, (9) counterparts, (10) integration 
clause, (11) time is of the essence, and (12) headings and 
captions.  Defendants argued that these terms are “standard 
provisions commonly found in settlement agreements.”    
However, the circuit court struck several of the additional 
provisions, finding that they were beyond what was agreed to 
at the settlement conference.  The difference between the 
proposed settlement agreement terms and the settlement 
conference terms evinces a genuine issue as to which terms 
were explicitly and implicitly agreed to at the settlement 
conference. 
The circuit court acknowledged in its Order Granting 
Motion to Enforce that the proposed settlement agreement 
contained terms beyond what the parties agreed to at the 
settlement conference.  Pursuant to the ICA’s analysis in 
Miller, this discrepancy alone creates a genuine issue of 
material fact.  See 9 Haw. App. at 67, 828 P.2d at 293.  The 
circuit court therefore erred in granting Defendants’ Motion 
to Enforce in light of the genuine issue of which terms the  
 
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
25 parties agreed to at the settlement conference.  
As courts are “more indulgent towards the materials 
submitted by the non- moving party,” Miller, 9 Haw. App. at 66, 
828 P.2d at 292, McKenna adequately refuted Defendants’ 
showing and demonstrated that genuine issues of material fact 
exist as to McKenna’s a ssent to the settlement agreement and 
as to the terms to which the parties agreed at the October 21, 
2014 settlement conference.  Pursuant to the standard that we 
now adopt, we hold that the circuit court erred in granting 
Defendants’ Motion to Enforce bec ause genuine issues of 
material fact exist as to the existence and terms of the 
original settlement agreement.  Rather than granting 
Defendants’ Motion to Enforce, the circuit court should have 
granted McKenna’s motion for an evidentiary hearing.   
On remand, the circuit court should hold an 
evidentiary hearing to address  the conflicting facts to 
determine whether the parties entered into a valid settlement 
agreement.  
IV.  CONCLUSION
 
We hold that, as with a motion for summary judgment, 
the circuit court may not grant a motion to enforce a 
settlement agreement when genuine issues of material fact 
remain.  Here, McKenna raised  genuine issues of material fact  
 
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
26 
regarding her assent to the settlement agreement and the 
discrepancy between the terms of the revised settlement 
agreement and the original settlement agreement.  The circuit 
court erroneously denied McKenna’s request for an evidentiary 
hearing, striking certain terms from the proposed settlement 
agreement and granting Defendants’ motion to enforce the 
settlement agreement. 
We vacate the ICA’s September 17, 2018 Judgment on 
Appeal.  We remand with instruction that the circuit court hold 
an evidentiary hearing to address the issues of fact as to the 
terms and existence of the settlement agreement in further 
proceedings consistent with this opinion.
