CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
(CAAP-16-0000315; AB 2014-352; DCD NO. 2-14-03204)
 
ORDER (1) ACCEPTING APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI,
(2) VACATING THE ICA’S JULY 6, 2016 ORDER DISMISSING THE APPEAL,
(3) REMANDING THE CASE TO THE ICA, AND (4) DISMISSING THE
MOTION FOR LEAVE TO PROCEED IN FORMA PAUPERIS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.,
with Nakayama, J., dissenting)
 
On July 19, 2016, petitioner/claimant-appellant Larry
 
Bosworth filed an application for writ of certiorari and a motion
 
for leave to proceed in forma pauperis. 
Upon consideration of
 
the documents and record in this matter, it appears that
 petitioner may not have been aware that his appeal was docketed
 
in the Intermediate Court of Appeals (“ICA”) and may not have
 
received a copy of the “Default of Record on Appeal (ND1),” filed
 
on June 6, 2016. Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED as follows:
 
(1) The application for writ of certiorari is
 
accepted. The ICA’s July 6, 2016 “Order Dismissing the Appeal
 Pursuant to HRAP 11(b)(2), (c)(2)” is vacated and the appeal is
 
remanded to the ICA. 
(2) The motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis
 
is dismissed without prejudice to petitioner seeking relief in
 
the ICA, as appropriate.
 
(3) On or before September 30, 2016, petitioner shall
 
pay the required filing and docketing fees for the appeal or
 
obtain an order to proceed in forma pauperis in the appeal. 
Failure to comply may result in the ICA dismissing the appeal. 
(4) The appellate clerk shall serve a copy of this
 
order on petitioner at his last known mailing address provided in
 
the record of this case. 
(5) Petitioner shall keep the court apprised in
 
writing of any changes in his mailing address. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, September 2, 2016.
