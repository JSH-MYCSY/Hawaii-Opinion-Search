OPINION OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J. 
 
I. Introduction 
 This is the second appeal arising out of a 2013 request for 
a declaratory ruling by a pro se litigant, a registered sex 
offender in the State of Washington, as to whether he is 
required to register as a sex offender in Hawai ʻi before visiting 
Hawaiʻi with his family for more than ten days.  Hawaiʻi Revised 
Statutes (“HRS”) § 846E -2(a) (2014) provides that “r egistration Electronically Filed

 under this subsection is required whenever the covered offender, 
whether or not a resident of this State, remains in this State 
for more than ten days or for an aggregate period exceeding 
thirty days in one calendar year.”   The Department of the 
Attorney General (“AG”) issued an October 15, 2015 ruling1 that 
Doe was required to register in Hawaiʻi because his out- of-state 
conviction of two counts of “ Communication with minor for 
immoral purposes,” Wash. Rev. Code Ann. (“RCW”)  § 9.68A.090 
(West 2010) (“the Washington offense”) , a gross misdemeanour 
under Washington law, qualifie s as a sexual offense under Hawaiʻi 
law.   
In its May 20, 2019 s ummary disposition order (“SDO”), the 
Intermediate Court of A ppeals (“ICA”) affirmed the Circuit Court 
of the First Circuit ’s (“circuit court[‘s]”)  April 7, 2016 f inal 
                         
1  In Doe v. Attorney General, 135 Hawai ʻi 390, 351 P.3d 1156 (2015) (“ Doe 
I”), we remanded the case to the AG, and the AG subsequently issued its 
October 15, 2015 ruling, which is the subject of this appeal.   
 
In Doe I, Doe appealed the Circuit Court of the First Circuit’s 
(“circuit court[’s]”) dismissal for lack of jurisdiction of his appeal of the 
AG’s initial response to his inquiry regarding sex offender registration 
requirements.  That response stated Doe would be required to register as a 
sex offender in Hawai ʻi before the AG could determine whether Doe’s offense is 
a covered offense under Hawai ʻi law, thereby requiring him to register as a 
sex offender.  We concluded that the circuit court had jurisdiction to hear 
Doe’s appeal, and that Hawaiʻi’s statutory scheme governing sex offender 
registration did not require an individual to “register” before
 the AG could 
determine whether registration was actually required under HRS § 846E -2(a).  
See 135 Hawaiʻi at 404, 351 P.3d a t 1170 (“[T]he sex offender registration 
scheme relies heavily on self -reporting.  Requiring Group 2 offenders [i.e., 
offenders who do not establish or maintain a residence in Hawai ʻi but who wish 
to visit Hawaiʻ i for more than ten days or for an aggregate  period greater 
than thirty days in a calendar year] to register before they can determine 
whether an out
-of-state offense is a ‘covered offense’  in Hawai ʻi effectively 
deters voluntary self -reporting.” (footnote omitted)).  ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***

 judgment, which was entered pursuant to the April 6, 2016 “Order 
Dismissing Notice of Appeal to Circuit Court Filed November 10, 
2015” of Doe’s appeal  from the AG’s ruling .  Doe’s application 
for a writ of certior ari (“Application”) presents the following 
questions: 
1.  Was the ICA’s ruling in conflict with this Court’s 
ruling in 
State v. Chun, 102 Haw. 383 [sic], 102 Hawai ʻi 
383, 76 P.3d 935, going past the elements of the offense in 
determining that [Doe’s]  conviction was a sex offense in 
Hawaii?  
 
2.  Was the ICA’s broad interpretation of “solicitation” 
and equating it to the element of [Doe’s] foreign 
conviction of “communicate” (as used in RCW  [§] 9.68A.090) 
in error?  
 
3.  Must an out -of-state conviction  be an actual offense in 
the State of Hawaii before triggering a requirement to 
register in the state of Hawaii?  Does legislative intent 
and a plain reading of HRS  [§] 846E-2(b) require the out -
of-state conviction to be an actual offense in this state 
before triggering a requirement to register?  
 
4.  Must the review of an out -of-state offense trigger a 
requirement to register in Hawaii be narrowly interpreted 
under the rule of lenity, as are all criminal statutes, 
given that an element of failure to register is that the 
offender must be convicted of a sexual offense as  
defined under HRS  [§] 846E-l?  
 
 For the following reasons, t he record do es not support the 
AG’s ruling, and the ICA erred in affirming the circuit court’s 
dismissal of Doe’s agency appeal.   We therefore reverse the 
ICA’s July 2, 2019 judgment on a ppeal as well as the circuit 
court’s April 7, 2016 final judgment.

 II. Background 
A. Factual Background 
In 2011, Doe pled guilty to two counts of the gross 
misdemeanor, “C ommunication with minor for immoral purposes,” 
RCW § 9.68A.090.  Doe stated the following facts in his plea 
agreement: “During the period between October 1, 2009 and 
October 31, 2009, on two separate occasions, I communicated with 
[omitted initials and birthdate of minor], a person under 18 
years of age, for an immoral purpose of a sexual nature.  This 
occurred in King County Washington.”   Doe was sentenced to 
twenty-four months of probation  and due to the conviction, Doe 
has been a registered sex offender in the State of Washington , 
and must continue to be registered until 2021 under RCW § 
9A.44.140(3) (West 2009, Supp. 2015).      
As Doe was “[p]resently . . . not a resident of Hawaii,    
. . . but [he and his family2] [we]re making plans for an 
extended visit to the islands and likely to exceed the 10 day 
grace period,” Doe wrote to then -Attorney General David Louie by 
letter dated March 24, 2013 petitioning for a “formal 
determination” that he not be required to register as a sex 
offender in Hawai ʻi.  With his let ter, Doe included several State 
of Washington court documents related to his conviction,  and 
                         
2  Doe uses the pronoun, “we,” i n his letter, but does not define it.  
Based on other documents in the record, it appears “we” refers to him and his 
family. ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***

 indicated that if further information was re
quired, to please 
contact him. 
After this court remanded the matter to the AG following 
Doe I, see supra note 1, the administrator of the Hawai ʻi 
Criminal Justice Data Center (“HCJDC”) issued a letter dated 
October 15, 2015 on behalf of then- Attorney General Douglas S. 
Chin,3 determining that “based solely upon the attached request 
and certified court documents pro vided to our office”:  
Your conviction in the State of Washington of two counts of 
“Communication with a Minor for an Immoral Purpose” is a 
“sexual offense” as defined under section 846E -1, HRS, 
because you committed acts that consisted of “criminal 
sexual conduct toward a minor” and/or “solicitation of a 
minor who is less than fourteen years old to engage in 
sexual conduct.”  As a person who was convicted of a 
“sexual offense,” you are considered a “sex offender” and 
are, therefore, a “covered offender” who  is required to 
register with the attorney general under section 846E -2, 
HRS. 
 
The letter also indicated: “Registration information will not be 
available to the public pursua
nt to section 846E- 3(h), HRS.”   
B. Circuit Court Proceedings 
 On November 10, 201
5, Doe filed a Notice of Appeal to the 
circuit court4 “from the decision of the Attorney General dated 
October 15, 2015, and received October 20, 2015, determining 
that Appellant’s Washington State misdemeanor conviction in 
                         
3  Under Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 43(c) , a public officer 
named in a case is  automatically substituted  by the officer’s  successor when 
the holder of the office ceases to hold office on appeal. Accordingly, 
Attorney General Clare E. Connors has been substituted for former Attorney 
General Douglas S. Chin.

 violation of RCW
 [§] 9.68A.090 was a ‘covered offense’ under HRS 
[§] 846E- 1.”  
 In his opening brief before the circuit court, Doe 
primarily argued that “[o]nly those offenders convicted of an 
out-of-state offense that would be a sexual offense in Hawai ʻi  
would be required to register,” meaning that “the elements of 
the out-of-state offense must include all the elements of the 
Hawaiʻi statute.”  Doe pointed out that the letter “failed to 
state what Hawaiʻi criminal offense for which [Doe]’s out -of-
state conviction was equivalent to, or make an element 
comparison to a Hawaiʻi criminal offense demonstrating the 
Washington offense was equivalent to a Hawai ʻi statute.”  Doe 
also asserted that in any event, “solicitation” is not an 
element of the Washington offense and that the Washington 
offense does not address “physical contact” and “therefore the 
[Washington] offense cannot categorically be considered an 
offense consisting of ‘criminal sexual conduct toward a minor’ 
under Hawaiʻi law.”  Additionally, Doe asserted that “RCW  [§] 
9.68A.090 does not require any specific criminal sexual 
misconduct to be committed toward a minor, but broadly 
criminalizes any communications of a sexual nature that could 
lead to criminal sexual conduct under Washington law.”  Doe also 
presented case law from other states with registration laws 
regarding out-of-state offenders, such as Alaska, demonstrating ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     *** 
 
7 
 an element-b y-element analytical approach.  Notably, Doe had 
requested a similar declaratory judgment from the State of 
Alaska, Department of Public Safety, and a court had found that 
Doe “is not required to register as a sex offender in Alaska” 
because “communicating with a minor for immoral purposes” was 
not similar to “attempted sexual abuse of a minor in the second 
degree” under Alaska law.   
 The AG  argued in response that the HCJDC correctly 
concluded Doe was required to register as a sex offender.   It 
pointed out that in State v. McNallie, 84 6 P.2d 1358, 1364 
(Wash. 1993), RCW § 9.68A.001 “‘ prohibits communication with 
children for the predatory purpose of promoting their exposure 
to and involvement in sexual misconduct,’” that “‘[i]mmoral 
purposes’ in the Washington statute means ‘immoral purposes of a 
sexual nature,’” and that therefore Doe’s “acts that resulted in 
his conviction in Washington S tate consisted of ‘criminal sexual 
conduct toward a minor’ and/or ‘solicitation of a minor who is 
less than fourteen years old to engage in sexual conduct.’”  
 In reply, Doe reiterated his opening brief statement that 
“[i]f this court were to require the Ap pellant to register for 
an out-of -state conviction that does not rise to the level of a 
crime in Hawai
ʻi, it . . . punishes the Appellant for conduct 
that, if committed in Hawaiʻi, would not be a crime.”   Further, 
Doe argued that although “criminal sexual conduct toward a ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     *** 
 
8 
 minor” and “solicitation of a minor . . . to engage in sexual 
conduct” may be elements of certain Hawai ʻi criminal offenses, 
“they themselves are not criminal offenses and are not 
separately listed in the criminal code.”  
 On February 12, 2016, the same day Doe filed his reply 
brief, he also filed a “Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings,” 
asking that oral arguments not be scheduled.  On February 17, 
2016, the circuit
 court nevertheless set Doe’s appeal for a 
hearing on March 18, 2016.  The A G took no position on Doe’s 
request, but did not file such notice until March 4, 2016.  A 
hearing was held on March 18, 2016 as scheduled, at which Doe 
represented himself.  
 
At the hearing, Doe again argued that the elements of the 
respective state offenses needed to be analyzed, but the AG 
disagreed.  The AG explained its position:  
We believe that the statutes are clear the registration 
requirement under 846E -2(a), from there, you know, it takes 
us clearly to the Definition section.  And under the 
Definition section, the sexual offenses has a list of 
seven, but there is an “or” on 6, which means that any of 
the seven could apply.  And we strongly believe that 3(a) 
and (b) both could apply to this situation.  The words do 
not match up exactly, you know, between our requirement and 
the Washington offense, but we don’t believe it needs to be 
like that.  
 
Specifically, the AG asserted that “Communication with a Minor 
for an Immoral Purpose . . . would match up with the 
Solicitation to Engage in Sexual Conduct with a Minor Who is 
Less Than 14 Years Old.”  Doe responded that although ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     *** 
 
9 
 solicitation is a subset of communication, “y ou could also 
communica
te that’s not a solicitation.”  
 After hearing the arguments, the circuit court issued its 
ruling, which held the AG did not err: 
What the Court is guided by is by HRS Section 846E -2, 
comparing that with the Washington statute 9.68A.090 and 
looking at the definition of sexual offense under HRS 
Section 846E.  So comparing everything amongst --  with each 
other, whether it’s internally or in comparison between the 
two, the Court cannot say that there was an error of law by 
the AG or that they violated the statute in so interpreting 
and in comparing the Hawai ʻi statute with the Washington 
statute to require that [Doe]  needs to register.  
 
So the Court will dismiss the appeal and affirm the 
AG’s decision with respect to the declaratory ruling.  
 
The circuit court issued its “Order Dismissing Notice of Appeal 
to Circuit Court Filed Novemb er 10, 2015” on April 6, 2016.   
Final judgment was entered on April 7, 2016.  
B. Appeal to the ICA 
 Doe filed a Notice of Appeal to the ICA.  After receiving 
written briefs substantively similar to those submitted to the 
circuit court, the IC
A affirmed the circuit court’s final 
judgment.  See Doe v. Attorney General, CAAP- 16-0000351, at 7 
(App. May 20, 2019) (SDO).   
The ICA rejected Doe’s focus on the elements of a sexual 
offenses in Hawai ʻi, and concluded
 that Doe’s Washington offense 
was a “sexual offense” as defined in HRS § 846E -1, which did not 
need to “match up exactly” to a Hawai ʻi Penal Code provision.  
Id.  As the definition of “sexual offense” consists of seven ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     *** 
 
10 
 relevant paragraphs, where the seventh refers to “[a]ny  . . . 
out-of-state . . . conviction for any offense that under the 
laws of this State would be a sexual offense as defined in 
paragraphs (1) through (6),” HRS § 846E -1, the ICA’s analysis 
focused on paragraph 3(B), which defined “sexual offense” as 
“[a]n act that consists of . . . [s]olicitation of a minor who 
is less than fourteen years old to engage in sexual conduct.”   
See Doe, SDO at 6-7.  The ICA applied the dictionary definition 
of “solicitation,”5 as that term is not defined in HRS Chapter 
846E or the Penal Code, and was “convinced that the use of the 
word . . . was meant in the more general sense,” and therefore 
“agree[d] with the AG’s determination that communicating with an 
                         
5  The ICA cited to https://www.merriam -
webster.com/dictionary/solicitation for the definition of “solicitation”:  
“1: the practice or act or an instance of soliciting[,] especially : 
ENTREATY, IMPORTUNITY[;] 2: a moving or drawing force : INCITEMENT, 
ALLUREMENT.”  Doe, SDO at 4 —5 n.7. 
  
The ICA then cited to https://www.merriam -
webster.com/dictionary/solicit for the definition of “solicit”:  
 
transitive verb  
 
1 a : to make petition to : ENTREAT  
b : to approach with a request or plea . . .  
2 : to urge (something, such as one's cause) strongly  
3 a : to entice or lure especially into evil  
b : to proposition (someone) especially as or in 
the character of a prostitute  
4 : to try to obtain by usually urgent requests or 
pleas . . . 
 
intransitive verb  
 
1 : to make solicitation : IMPORTUNE 
2  of a prostitute : to offer to have sexual relations 
with someone for money[.]  
 
Doe, SDO at 5 n.7.  ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     *** 
 
11 
 eleven-year-old for an immoral purpose of a sexual nature falls 
within the plain language of the sexual offense definition in 
HRS § 846E-1.”  See id.  The ICA stated it was not necessary for 
it to address whether Doe’s Washington conviction was a “sexual 
offense” under paragraph 3(A), “[c]riminal sexual conduct toward 
a minor.”  See Doe, SDO at 7 n.8.   
C. Application for Writ of Certiorari 
In his Application, Doe presents the following questions: 
1.  Was the ICA’s ruling in conflict with this Court’s 
ruling in 
State v. Chun, 102 Haw. 383 [sic], 102 Hawaiʻi 
383, 76 P.3d 935, going past the elements of the offense in 
determining that [Doe’s] conviction was a sex offense in 
Hawaiʻi?  
 
2.  Was the ICA’s broad interpretation of “solicitation” 
and equating it to the element of [Doe’s] foreign 
conviction of “communicate” (as used in RCW  [§] 9.68A.090) 
in error?  
 
3.  Must an out -of-state conviction be an actual offense in 
the State of Hawai ʻi before triggering a requirement to 
register in the state of Hawai ʻi?  Does legislative intent 
and a plain reading of HRS  [§] 846E-2(b) require the out -
of-state conviction to be an actual offense in this state 
before triggering a requirement to register?  
 
4.  Must the review of an out -of
-state offense trigger a 
requirement to register in Hawai ʻi be narrowly interpreted 
under the  rule of lenity, as are all criminal statutes, 
given that an element of failure to register is that the 
offender must be convicted of a sexual offense as  
defined under HRS [§] 846E -l?  
 
In sum, Doe argues: (1) an “elemental comparison” between 
the Washington offense and a specific 
Hawaiʻi offense is required 
for Doe to be considered a “sex offender ,” (2) the ICA abused 
its discretion when it used “solicitation” interchangeably with 
“communication ,” and (3) because the failure of a covered ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     *** 
 
12 
 offender to comply with Hawai ʻi’s registration scheme is a crime 
pursuant to HRS § 846E
-9(c) (2014), whether a person is a 
“covered offender” is therefore an element of a criminal 
statute, which should be construed in accordance with the rule 
of lenity requiring any statutory ambiguity to be construed in 
favor of the defendant, i.e., Doe.   
The AG responds that,  at bottom, Doe’s Washington offense 
was a “sexual offense” under paragraph 3(B) of the HRS § 846E -1 
definition of “sexual offense” for the reasons stated by the 
ICA.  As such, the AG argues,  “Doe cannot sidestep the 
dispositive issue and analysis described above, simply by 
arguing that the specific Washington statutory sex offense for 
which he was convicted has no precise Hawai ʻi analo
gue.”  
Moreover, according to the AG, because RCW §  9.68A.090 has been 
interpreted to prohibit the “communication with chil dren for the 
predatory purpose of promoting their exposure and involvement in 
sexual mi sconduct,” the AG  argues Doe, “through his 
communicative actions[,]  . . . effectively solicited a minor who 
was less than fourteen years old to engage in sexual conduct. ”  
Thus, the AG argues the ICA did not err when it compared 
“solicitation” with “communication.”   Lastly, the AG asserts the 
ICA’s SDO is not in conflict with the rule of lenity because 
that interpretative “rule” applies to criminal statutes, not 
civil ones, such as Hawaiʻi’s registration scheme.   ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***

 III. Standards of Review 
A. Administrative Agency Appeals 
Ordinarily, deference will be given to decisions of 
administrative agencies acting within the realm of their 
expertise.  The rule of judicial deference, however, does 
not apply when the agency’s reading of the statute 
contravenes the legislature’s manifest purpose.  
Consequently, we have not hesitated to reject an incorrect 
or unreasonable statutory construction advanced by the 
agency entrusted with the st atute’s implementation.

IV. Discussion 
A.  Overview of Hawaiʻi’s Sex Offender
 Registration Scheme as to 
Out-of-State Offenders Who Wish to be Present in Hawai ʻi for 
More than Ten Days or for an Aggregate Period Exceeding 
Thirty Days in One Calendar Year 
 
Persons who commit 
sexual offenses out -of-state and are 
subject to the registration requirements of the jurisdiction in 
which those crimes were committed (“out -of-state offenders”), 
who also wish to be present in Hawai i for more than ten days or 
for an aggregate period exceeding t
hirty days in one calendar 
year, must register in Hawai ʻi if they are “covered offenders.”  
A covered offender  shall register with the attorney general 
and comply with the provisions of this chapter for life or ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     *** 
 
14 
 for a shorter period of time as provided in th
is chapter.  
Registration under this subsection is required whenever the 
covered offender, whether or not a resident of this State, 
remains in this State for more than ten days or for an 
aggregate period exceeding thirty days in one calendar 
year.  A covered offender shall be eligible to petition the  
court in a civil proceeding for an order that the covered 
offender's registration requirements under this chapter be 
terminated, as provided in section 846E -10. 
 
HRS § 846E-2(a) (2014) (emphasis added).  A “cov
ered offender” 
is a “sex offender” or an “offender against minors.”6  HRS § 
846E-1.  A “sex offender” is a “person who is or has been 
convicted at any time . . . of a ‘sexual offense.’”  Id.  
Hawaiʻi’s registration scheme defines “sexual offense” as: 
“Sexual offense” means an offense that is:  
 
      (1)
  Set forth in section 707 -730(1), 707 -731(1), 
707-732(1), 707 -733(1)(a), 707 -733.6, 712- 1202(1), or 712 -
1203(1), but excludes conduct that is criminal only because 
of the age of the victim, as provided in section 707 -
730(1)(b), or section 707 -732(1)(b) if the perpetrator is 
under the age of eighteen;  
 
     (2)  An act defined in section 707 -720 if the 
charging document for the offense for which there has been 
a conviction alleged intent to subject the victim to a 
sexual offense;  
 
      (3)  An act that consists of:  
 
           (A)  Criminal sexual conduct toward a minor, 
including but not limited to an offense set forth in 
section 707 -759; 
 
           (B)  Solicitation of a minor who is less than 
fourteen  years old to engage in sexual conduct;  
 
           (C)  Use of a minor in a sexual performance;  
 
           (D)  Production, distribution, or possession of 
child pornography chargeable as a felony under section 707 -
750, 707 -751, or 707- 752; 
 
                         
6  Because an “offender against minors” means a person who is not a “sex 
offender,” this portion of the definition of “covered offender” is not at 
issue in this appeal, and therefore is not further discussed.  ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     *** 
 
15 
            (E)
  Electronic enticement of a child 
chargeable under section 707 -756 or 707- 757 if the offense 
was committed with the intent to promote or facilitate the 
commission of another covered offense as defined in this 
section; or  
 
           (F)  Solicitation of a minor for prostitution 
in violation of section 712 -1209.1;
 
 
      (4)  A violation of privacy under section 711 -1110.9; 
 
      (5)  An act, as described in chapter 705, that is an 
attempt, criminal solicitation, or criminal conspiracy to 
commit one of the offenses designated in paragraphs (1) 
through (4);  
 
      (6)  A criminal offense that is comparable to or that 
exceeds a sexual offense as defined in paragraphs (1) 
through (5);  
 
      (7)  Any federal, military, out -of-state, tribal, or 
foreign conviction for any offense that under the laws of 
this State would be a sexual offense as defined in 
paragraphs (1) through (6).  
 
HRS § 846E-1 (definition of “sexual offense”).  Thus, whether 
Doe is required to register as a sex offender in Hawaiʻ i
 before 
visiting Hawaiʻ i hinges on whether the offense for which he was 
convicted would be a sexual offense as defined by HRS § 846E-1.     
 The AG’s ruling  was based on an interpretation that Doe’s 
offense was a “sexual offense” under paragraphs 3 (A) and (B) 
above.  We therefore analyze both provisions.  
B.  The ICA Erred in Affirming the Circuit C ourt’s Decision on 
the Grounds T hat Doe’s Offense “Would Be” a “Sexual 
Offense” under  Paragraph  3(B) of HRS § 846E- 1’s Definition 
of “Sexual Offense”  
 
 As a preliminary matter, in referring to “[a]ny . . . out -
of-state . . . conviction for any offense that under the laws of 
this State would be a sexual offense,”  paragraph 7 contemplates 
that Hawai ʻi law 
is to be applied to the underlying act or acts ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***

 constituting the offense (as opposed to merely the statute 
violated) to determine whether the offense “would be” a “sexual 
offense” as defined in HRS § 846E -1.  Additionally, as noted by 
the ICA, paragrap h 3 refers to an “act that consists of ” (and 
therefore not limited to) any enumerated acts in paragraphs  3(A) 
through 3(F).  See  Doe, SDO at 6.  Thus, the ICA correctly 
interpreted Hawai ʻi’s registration
 scheme to require that Doe’s 
offense meet the defini tion of “sexual offense” in HRS § 846E -1, 
and that the offense need not “match up” to each of the elements 
of a particular crime in the Hawai ʻi Penal Code. 
The record of Doe ’s offense is sparse and limited to the 
following: “During the period between October 1, 2009 and 
October 31, 2009, on two separate occasions, I communicated with 
[omitted initials and birthdate of minor], a person under 18 
years of age, for an immoral purpose of a sexual nature.  This 
occurred in King County Washington.”  The AG argued, and the ICA 
agreed, that this offense “consist[ed] of” “[s]olicitation of a 
minor who is less than fourteen years old to engage in sexual 
conduct,” an act enumerated in paragraph 3(B) of the definition 
of “sexual offense.”  Doe, SDO at 6.  In this regard, the ICA 
erred. 
It is uncontested that the minor with whom Doe communicated 
on two separate occasions was less than fourteen years old at 
the time the acts were committed.  What is disputed is whether ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     *** 
 
17 
 Doe’s “communicat[ion] . . . for an immoral purpose of a sexual 
nature” amounts to “ [s]olicitation of a minor . . . to engage in 
sexual conduct.”   
Although Doe correctly points out that “solicitation” is a 
“subset” of “communication,” and therefore not all 
“communication” amounts to “solicitation,” that analysis is 
incomplete because Doe’s “communication” is modified by the 
prepositional phrase, “ for an immoral purpose of a sexual 
nature.” (Emphasis added. )  Even so, nothing in the 
prepositional phrase indicates that the “ communicat[ion] . . . 
for an immoral purpose of a sexual nature” was to “solicit” the 
minor to “engage in sexual conduct.”  In other words, a 
“communication” for “an immoral purpose” could exist without a 
“solicitation” “to engage in sexual conduct.”   
In sum, although “ [s]olicitation of a minor . . . to engage 
in sexual conduct” may be one possible “ communicat[ion] . . . 
for an immoral purpose of a sexual nature,” because the record 
is bare as to the substance of Doe’s communication, nothing in 
the record indicates Doe’s underlying of fense consisted of 
solicitation of a minor to engage in sexual conduct.  
Accordingly, the AG incorrectly concluded that Doe’s out -of-
state offense “would be” a “sexual offense” under paragraph 
3(B), and therefore the ICA erred in affirming the circuit 
court’s decision on those grounds.  ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***

 C. The Record Also Does Not Demonstrate Doe’s Offense  
“Would Be” a “Sexual Offense” under  Paragraph 3(A) of HRS § 
846E-1’s Definition of “Sexual Offense”  
 
 The ICA declined to address whether Doe’s offense “would 
be” a “sexual offense ” under paragraph 3(A) of HRS § 846E- 1’s 
definition of “sexual offense,” “ [a]n act that consists of . . . 
[c]riminal sexual conduct toward a minor, including but not 
limited to an offense set forth in section 707- 759.”  See Doe, 
SDO at 7 n.8.  However, as this is a question of law, and as it 
was appropriately raised below, we address it briefly now. 
As Doe’s underlying offense does not im plicate HRS § 707-
759 (2014), “Indecent electronic display to a child, ”7 the 
following analysis focuses on paragraph 3(A)’s reference to 
“criminal sexual conduct t oward a minor.” (E mphasis added. )  By 
                         
7  Indecent electronic display to a child.   (1)  Any person 
who intentionally masturbates or intentionally exposes the 
genitals in a lewd or lascivious manner live over a 
computer online service , internet service, or local 
bulletin board service and who knows or should know or has 
reason to believe that the transmission is viewed on a 
computer or other electronic device by:  
 
       (a)  A minor known by the person to be under the age 
of eighteen years; 
 
       (b)  Another person, in reckless disregard of the 
risk that the other person is under the age of eighteen 
years, and the other person is under the age of eighteen 
years; or  
 
       (c)  Another person who represents that person to be 
under the age of eighteen years, is guilty of indecent 
electronic display to a child.  
 
      (2)  Indecent electronic display to a child is a 
misdemeanor.

 the statute’s plain meaning, the conduct must amount to a crime 
under Hawai ʻi law, i.e., violate the Penal Code.  See also  HRS § 
846E-1 (defining “crime against minors,” in part, as “a criminal 
offense”).  Here, the AG , in its October 15, 2015 decision,  did 
not identify what statute, if any, Doe would have violated by 
his offense, nor did the AG identify any in its briefing before 
the circuit court, ICA, or in response to Doe’s Application.  
Indeed, the AG could not compare Doe’s offense to HRS § 707-759, 
or for that matter, to other similar statutes such as HRS § 707-
756 (2014), “Electronic enticement of a child in the first 
degree,” or HRS § 707 -757 (2014), “E lectronic enticement of a 
child in the second degree,” because the record is bare as to 
the substance and medium of Doe’s communication.   
V. Conclusion 
For the foregoing reasons, t he record does not support the 
AG’s decision, and the ICA therefore erred in affirming the 
circuit court’s dismissal of Doe’s agency appeal.  Accordingly, 
we reverse the ICA’s July 2, 2019 judgment on a ppeal as well as 
the circuit court’s April 7, 2016 final judgment.
