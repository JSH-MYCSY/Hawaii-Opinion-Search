OPINION OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J.
 
 
I.  Introduction  
 
In 2008, Debbie Quel (“Quel”), an eighteen -year cafeteria 
helper for the State of Hawai ʻi Department of Education (“DOE”), 
applied for “service -connected disability retirement” benefits 
pursuant to Hawai ʻi Revised Statutes (“HRS”) § 88 -79(a) (Supp. 
2007), which provides in relevant part that “ any member who has Electronically Filed

2 
 been permanently incapacitated for duty . . . as the cumulative 
result of some occupational hazard . . . may be retired by the 
board for service- connected disability[.]”   
There was no dispute that Quel was a “member” “permanently 
incapacitated for duty” “as the cumulative result of” her  
working conditions.  Quel’s application for “service -connected 
disability retirement”  benefits was, however, denied by the 
Board of Trustees of the Employees’ Retirement System of the 
State of Hawaiʻ i
 (“ERS Board”) on the grounds that the working 
conditions that caused Quel’s permanent incapacity did not 
constitute an “occupational hazard” as defined by Hawaiʻi law.  
The Circuit Court of the First Circuit1 (“circuit court”) and the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals (“ICA”) affirmed.  
The ERS Board concluded that although Quel’s permanent 
incapacity was due to the cumulative effects of work- related 
activities, she failed to meet her burden of establishing that 
her incapacity resulted from an “occupational hazard .”  The ERS 
Board based its decision on Quel ’s failu re to introduce evidence 
that the “lifting requirements” of her job were “different in 
character from those in the general run of occupations ” 
testified to by the ERS Medical Board’s (“Medical Board”)  
physician chair and “that her work related problems were limited 
to a relatively few number of occupations .”

 On certiorari, Quel contends the ICA, circuit court, and 
ERS Board erred in adopting the definition of “occupational 
hazard” contained in Hawaiʻi Admin
istrative Rules  
(“HAR”) § 6-22-2 (effective 1989- 2009), which defines the term 
as “a danger or risk which is inherent in, and concomitant to, a 
particular occupation or particular job, if [it is] not a risk 
common to employment in general.”   Quel contends HAR § 6 -22-2 
contravenes HRS § 88- 79(a), as HRS § 88 -79(a) affords service -
connected disability retirement to members for permanent 
incapacity due to “some occupational hazard.”  Quel  also asserts 
error in the ICA and circuit court’s affirmance of the ERS 
Board’s conclusion that he r permanent incapacity did not result 
from an “occupational hazard.”  
We hold that HAR § 6 -22-2 correctly defines an  
“occupational hazard” a s “a danger or risk which is inherent in, 
and concomitant to, a particular occupation or particular  job, 
if [it is] not a risk common to employment in general[,] ” as the 
definition is based on our decisions in Lopez v. Bd.  of Trs., 
Emps.’ Ret . Sys., 66 Haw. 127, 129, 657 P.2d 1040, 1042  (1983), 
and Komatsu v. Bd. of Trs., Emps.’ Ret. Sys., 67 Haw. 485, 494, 
693 P.2d 405, 411  (1984).  We further hold that the definition 
of “occupational hazard” for purposes of service- connected 
disability retirement benefits does not include a requirement 
that permanent incapacity resulting from the cumulative effects ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
4 
 of work-related activities be “limited to a relatively few 
number of occupations.”   Finally, we also hold that the ERS 
Board clearly erred in finding and concluding that Quel’s 
permanent capacity did not result from “a danger or risk which 
is inherent in, and concomitant to,” her “particular occupation 
or particular job,” which was “not a risk common to employment 
in general.”  
Accordingly, we vacate the ICA’s Jul y 6, 2018 judgment on 
appeal and the circuit court’s April 13, 2016 (1) “Decision and 
Order Affirming the Final Decision of the Appellee Board of 
Trustees of the Employees’ Retirement System of the State of 
Hawaii and Dismissing Appellant Debbie S. Quel’s  Appeal” and  
(2) final judgment.  We remand this case to the ERS Board for 
further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 
II.  Background 
A. Factual background 
Quel worked for the DOE  at Waialua Elementary School, 
Mililani High School, Haleiwa Elementary  School, and Wahiawa 
Elementary School, before transferring to Helemano Elementary 
School (“Helemano”).  
At Helemano, Quel’s daily duties as a cafeteria helper  
involved lifting heavy trap doors, putting things into the oven 
for breakfast, scooping rice with her left ha
nd for about 250 
trays, pinching dough, peeling potatoes, cutting vegetables, ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
5 
 opening numerous cans with an old- fashioned  manual can opener, 
carrying heavy boxes or cases of food products, and serving the 
meals to the students.  She also helped cook rice in the oven.  
Because Helemano did not have rice cookers, to cook the rice, 
she would wash the rice in the morning, place the rice into six 
or seven eight-inch pans, then lift and slide the pans over her 
head into the oven, which was taller than Quel.  
She also 
emptied the vegetables and other food out of the pots used to 
make stew.  During Quel’s testimony, she explained that  Helemano 
did not have the equipment common in other school cafeterias -- 
such as rice cookers, electric can openers, and machines for 
cutting vegetables or bread -- which increased the repetitive 
labor she had to do every day.   In the summer, Quel did 
custodial-type work, such as buffing floors, shampooing the 
carpet, moving furniture, and cleaning up.  
 
Quel’s last day of work for the DOE at Helemano was on 
November 12, 2008.   The next day, she was seen by a physician, 
who evaluated Quel’s swollen hands and painful shoulders  
allegedly caus ed by repetitive motions and activities at work.   
For the next few years, Quel was seen by various physicians for 
these injuries.  She was diagnosed with various work -related 
injuries to her hands, wrists, and shoulders, and underwent 
multiple surgeries to her shoulder s, wrists, fingers,  and thumb.  
 ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***

 B. Application for service -connected disability benefits 
On November 22, 2010, Quel applied  for service- connected 
disability retirement benefits with the ERS Board.  The Medical 
Board issued a report to the ERS Board on August 22, 2012 
(“Medical Board Report”) , indicating it had reviewed Quel’s 
application; her employment, personnel, workers’ compensation, 
and medical records;  and had interviewed Quel.2  The Medical  
Board concluded that Quel was permanently incapacitated f or 
performing her job as a cafeteria helper.   The Medical Board 
also opined, however, that Quel’s permanent incapacity was not 
“the cumulative result of a danger or risk inherent in and 
concomitant to” her occupation.  
On March 11, 2013, the ERS Board reviewed the Medical Board 
Report and made a preliminary decision to deny Quel’s 
application for service-connected disability retirement 
benefits, and informed Quel of her appeal  rights.  Quel filed an 
                     
2  HRS § 88- 79(d) (2012) provides:  
 
(d) The board may determine whether or not the disability 
is the result of an accident occurring while in the actual 
performance of duty at some definite time and place and 
that the disability was not the result of wilful negligence 
on the part of the member.   The board may accept as 
conclusive:  
 
(1) The certification made by the head of the agency 
in which the member is employed; or  
(2) A finding to this effect by the medical board .  
 
HAR Title 6, Chapter 22 governs procedures for certifications and 
findings of the Medical Board relating to matters including service -connected 
disability retirement benefits under HRS § 88 -79.  HAR § 6 -22-1(2) (effective 
1984-2009).   ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
7 
 appeal on April 29, 2013, and the matter was referred to the 
Office of Administrative Hearings.  A hearing was conducted on 
April 10, 2014; Quel and the physician  chair of the Medical 
Board appeared at the hearing, represented by counsel.   The 
hearings officer received and reviewed evidence regarding Quel’s  
employment and medical treatment.  
In her post- hearing brief, Quel noted that because  the 
Medical Board had conceded she was permanently incapacitated for 
further performance of duty as a cafeteria worker, the only 
issue was whether her repetitive use injuries were the result of 
occupational hazards from working as a cafeteria helper.  Quel 
asserted the Medical Board’s recommended denial of her service-
connected disability retirement benefits w as based on an 
erroneously narrow view of “occupational hazard” and not on the 
causation of her injuries, which was left undisputed.  She 
contended her medical records,  as well as  her testimony,  clearly 
indicated her injuries were a result of overuse, repetitive use,  
or cumulative trauma while performing her job, entitling her to 
service-connected disability retirement benefits.  Quel also 
cited to Komatsu as supporting  her position.   
In opposition, the  Medical Board contended Quel’s permanent 
incapacity was not the cumulative result of an occupational 
hazard, citing to Lopez, Komatsu,  and the definition of 
“occupational hazard ” in HAR § 6-22-2.  The Medical Board argued ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
8 
 that repetitive use of hands and shoulders is common to various 
other occupations, including administrative assistants, 
custodians, musicians, and medical professionals, all who  also 
use their shoulders  and hands at work.  It further argued that 
Quel’s job description as a cafeteria helper did not list any 
unusual occupational hazards, the use of Quel’s hands an d 
shoulders was not uncommon to employment in general, and none of 
the actions in her job description were inherently dangerous.  
The Medical Board requested the ERS Board affirm its preliminary 
decision and deny Quel service-connected disability retirement 
benefits.
 
On July 23, 2014, the hearings  officer issued a recommended 
decision containing fifty -one findings of fact (“FOFs”) and 
twenty-nine conclusions of law (“COLs”).  On August 28, 2014,  
the ERS Board issued a proposed decision adopting relevant FOFs 
and COLs in the hearings o fficer’s recommended decision in their 
entirety.3  After arguments on Quel’s exceptions to the proposed 
decision on May 13, 2015, on June 9, 2015, the ERS Board issued 
its final decision affirming its proposed decision.   
In its FOFs, the ERS Board found in relevant part:  
46.  Repetitive use of the hands and arms is common to 
employment in general.  . . .  
                     
3  The ERS Board  amended COL 1 to indicate that as a noncontributory plan 
member, Quel’s application was actually brought under HRS § 88 -285 (Supp. 
2005), not HRS § 88 -336 (Supp. 2007), which governs hybrid plan members.  As 
the ERS Board also noted, service -connected disability requirement benefits 
under HRS § 88- 285 are, in any event, adjudged under the requirements set 
forth in HRS § 88 -79.   ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***

 47.  Other occupations besides cafeteria helper require 
repetitive use of  a person's  hands.  This includes court 
reporters, clerical workers, people who stock shelves, 
people who  pick strawberries, people who cut hair, dish 
washers, mail sorters, data entry workers,  musicians, 
people who do sign language, and surgeons. . . .  
 
In its FOFs and COLs, the ERS Board found and concluded in 
relevant part:  
16. [] [The ERS Board] finds and concludes [Quel’s] 
incapacitation was due to the cumulative effects of work 
related activities.  
 
17.  That conclusion, however, does not end the analysis 
of [Quel’s]  claim.  [Quel’s] position appears to be  . . . 
that work related incapacitating injuries due to repetitive 
work activities equate to an  “occupational hazard."  The 
[ERS Board] concludes, however, that such a position is 
not in accord with the law applicable to ERS service -
connected disability benefits.  
 
18.  The definition of "occupational hazard" is a legal 
one that must follow the  specific terms of the statutes and 
regulations applicable to the ERS.  
 
. . . . 
  
22.  As the Lopez case explains, the mere fact that a 
medical condition is job  related does not lead to the 
conclusion that the condition is the result of an 
occupational  hazard. 
 
An occupational hazard is a danger or risk which is 
inherent in[] and concomitant  to a particular 
occupation.  To be considered an occupational hazard,
the causative factors must be those which are not 
ordinarily incident to employment in general  
and must be different in character from those found 
in the general run of occupations.   
 
66 Haw. at 129, 657 P.2d at 1042.  [Emphasis omitted.]  
[Quel] failed to introduce evidence that the lifting  
requirements were  "different in character" from those in
the general run of occupations that were the subject of 
[the 
Medical Board physician chair’s] testimony .  
 
23.  The [ERS Board] does not interpret the concept of the 
general run of  occupations to automatically include all 
occupations.  [Emphasis omitted.]  The Medical Board 
introduced  evidence that [Quel’s] problems were similar to 
work related problems across a wide  spectrum of 
occupations. . . . [Quel] had the burden to introduce 
evidence that her work related problems were  limited to a ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
10 
 relatively few number of occupations, but she failed to do 
so. 
 
(Emphases added.)   
Thus, the ERS Board concluded Quel’s permanent incapacity 
did not qualify as an “occupational hazard” because she failed 
to show that her work -related problems were “different in 
character from those in the general run of occupations ” and 
“were limited to a relatively few number of occupations.”  On 
this basis, the ERS Board ruled that Quel was  not entitled to 
service-connected disability retirement benefits.   
C. Appeal to the circuit c ourt  
Quel filed a notice of appeal to the circuit court.  T he 
circuit court concluded Quel failed to carry her burden of 
proving her permanent incapacity was the cumulative result of an 
occupational hazard, affirmed the ERS Board, and filed its final 
judgment on April 13 , 2016.  
D. Appeal to the ICA  
Quel further appealed to the ICA.  In its May 18, 2018 
summary disposition order  (“SDO”), the ICA ruled the ERS Board 
and the circuit court did not err in relying on the definition 
of “occupational hazard” contained in HAR § 6 -
22-2.  Quel v. Bd.  
of Trs., Emps. ’ Ret. Sys., No. CAAP- 16-0000355, at 3  (App. May  
18, 2018).  The ICA also concluded Quel failed to prove her work 
conditions were “not ordinarily incident to employment in 
general” and were “different in character from those found in ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
11 
 the general run of occupations.”   Quel, SDO at 5.  The ICA 
affirmed the circuit court’s final judgment .  Id. 
D. Certiorari application  
Quel’s certiorari application raises one question:  
Whether or not cumulative trauma (i.e., excessive 
kitchen and cafeteria work of cutting, peeling, chopping, 
stirring, missing  [sic], pinching, lifting and carrying 
resulting in [Quel’s] upper extremity injuries) is an 
“Occupational Hazard” entitling [Quel] to Service -Connected 
Disability Retirement benefits with the ERS.  
 
III.  Standards of Review 
A. Interpretation of a statute 
Statutory interpretation is a question of law reviewable de 
novo.  Citizens Against Reckless Dev. v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals, 
114 Hawai ‘i 184, 
193, 159 P.3d 143, 152 (2007).   When 
interpreting statutes, we  look at the following: 
When there is ambiguity in a statute, “the meaning of 
the ambiguous words may be sought by examining the context, 
with which the ambiguous words, phrases, and sentences may 
be compared, in order to ascertain their true meaning. ” 
 
Moreover, the courts may resort to extrinsic aids in 
determining legislative intent, such as legislative 
history, or the reason and spirit of the law.

3-94, 159 P.3d at 152- 53 (citation omitted). 
B. Administrative agency a ppeals 
An appellate court reviews administrative decisions by 
applying the following standard: 
Review of a decision made by the circuit court upon 
its review of an agency’s decision is a secondary appeal.  
The standard of review is one in which [the appellate] 
court must determine whether the circuit court was right or 
wrong in its decision, applying the standards set forth in 
HRS § 91 -14(g) to the agency’s decision.

IV.  Discussion 
A. The definition of “ occupational h azard” in HAR § 6 -22-2
is consistent with our case law.  
 
Preliminarily, on certiorari, 
Quel repeats her contention 
that the definition of “occupational hazard” in HAR § 6-22-2 
contravenes HAR § 88- 79(a).  She points out HRS § 88-79(a) 
provides that “ any member who has been permanently incapacitated 
for duty . . . as the cumulative result of some occupational 
hazard . . . may be retired by the board for service- connected 
disability[.]”  She argues that HRS § 88-79(a) does not restrict 
“some occupational hazard ” to the definition in HAR § 6-22-2, “a 
danger or risk which is inherent in, and concomitant to, a 
                     
4  HRS § 91- 14 (Supp. 2016), entitled “Judicial review of contested 
cases,” provides in relevant part:  
 
(g) Upon review of the record , the court may affirm the 
decision of the agency or remand the case with instructions 
for further proceedings; or it may reverse or modify the 
decision and order if the substantial rights of the 
petitioners may have been prejudiced because the 
administrative findings, conclusions, decisions, or orders 
are: 
(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory 
provisions;  
(2) In excess of the statutory authority  or 
jurisdiction of the agency;  
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure;  
(4) Affected by other error of law;  
(5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, 
probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; or  
(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized by 
abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of 
discretion. ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
13 
 particular occupation or particular job, if [it is] not a risk
common to employment in general.”   Quel therefore contends  the
ICA, circuit court, and ERS Board erred in applying the  
HAR § 6-22-2 definition of “occupational hazard” to her case.   
 
Quel’s cont ention is without merit, as the definition of 
“occupational hazard” in HAR § 6 -22-2 is derived from our 
decisions in Lopez and Komatsu .   
In Lopez, we held that an “occupational hazard” for 
service-connected disability retirement purposes “is a danger or 
risk which is inherent in, and concomitant to a particular 
occupation,” and that the disability’s “ca usative factors must 
be those which are not ordinarily incident to employment in 
general and must be different in character from those found in 
the general run of occupations.”  66 Haw. at 129, 657 P.2d at 
1042.  In that case, a state employee contended the stress and 
pressures from his job contributed to a
 mental health-related 
disability and that he should be eligible for service
-connected 
disability retirement benefits.  66 Haw. at 128, 657 P.2d at 
1041.  We adopted the definition above and ruled that th e 
pressures and stress in the employee’s job were not 
exceptionally different from those found by other employees in 
other occupations.  66 Haw.  at 130, 657 P.2d at 1042. 
The next year, we  decided Komatsu , which addressed a city 
employee’s service -connected disability retirement claim for an ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
14 
 obstructive respiratory defect caused by exposure to mold and 
fungi from a defective workplace air conditioning system, which 
permanently incapacitated him for further performance of duty . 
67 Haw. at 488, 494, 693 P.2d at 407, 411.  We examined the 
employee’s specific work environment in addressing whether the 
work environment 
constituted an occupational hazard, not whether 
the exposure to the contaminants  that caused  the employee ’s 
disability was an occupational hazard to office workers in 
general.  67 Haw. at 494, 693 P.2d at 411-12.  We stated:  
Where, as in this case, the employee was exposed to 
mold or fungi in his particular work environment over a 
lengthy period and the causal nexus between the exposure 
and his disability is undisputed,  entitlement  to service-
connected disability retirement benefits is clear.   For a 
danger that accompanies a particular job is an 
“occupational hazard” if it is not a risk common to 
employment in general.  And since the peril of noxious 
organisms emitting from faulty air -conditioning systems is 
hardly incident to employment generally, we are led to the 
ineluctable conclusion that the intermediate court erred in 
holding Komatsu's disability was not the cumulative result 
of an “occupational hazard.”  
 
Id. (internal citation and footnote omitted) .  Therefore, 
in Komatsu, we ruled that where a causal nexus between a 
work condition and a disability is undisputed, entitlement 
to service-connected disability retirement benefits is 
clear, and a danger that accompanies a particular job is an 
“occupational hazard” if it is not a risk common to 
employment in general.  
 
 Thus, t he definition of “occupational hazard” in         
HAR § 6-22-2 is an amalgam of our definitions of the term in ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
15 
 Lopez and Komatsu.  Quel’s contention that  the ICA, circuit 
court, and ERS Board erred in applying the HAR § 6- 22-2 
definition of “occupational hazard” to her case  is therefore 
without merit. 
B. An occupational hazard does not require a risk be “limited 
to a relatively few number of occupations. ”  
  
Although the definition  of “occupational hazard ” quoted by 
the ERS Board is correct, in denying service- connected 
disability retirement benefits to Quel, the ERS Board added a 
requirement to the definition 
that does not exist in the law.  
In FOF 47, the ERS Board found that other occupations besides 
cafeteria helpers  require rep etitive use of a person's hands, 
including “ court reporters, clerical workers, people who stock 
shelves, people who pick strawberries, people who cut hair, dish 
washers, mail sorters, data entry workers, musicians, people who 
do sign language, and surgeons. ”  Based on this finding, the ERS 
Board concluded in COL 23 that Quel’s permanent incapacity did 
not qualify as an “occupational hazard” bec ause she failed to 
show her work- related problems “were limited to a relatively few 
number of occupations. ”  
Lopez, Komatsu, and HAR § 6-22-2 do not include a 
requirement that permanent incapacity resulting from the 
cumulative effects of work- related activities be “limited to a 
relatively few number of occupations.”  Rather, an “occupational  ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
16 
 hazard” is “a danger or risk which is inherent in, and 
concomitant to, a particular occupation or particular job, if 
[it is] not a risk common to employmen t in general.”    
By defining an occupational hazard to exclude risks common 
to employment in general, we only excluded “work pressures and 
frustrations, in and of themselves, [from]  constitut[ing]  an 
occupational hazard. ”5  Lopez, 66 Haw. at  129, 657 P.2d at  1042.  
We did not impose an additional requirement that an employee 
prove their work- related problems “were limited to a relatively 
few number of occupations.”   In fact, in Komatsu, we rejected a 
requirement that an employee submit data comparing their 
employment to other industries, and noted “ the imposition of 
similar requisites in other situations would render 
‘occupational hazard ’ well-nigh meaningless . . . .  We neither 
intended nor envisioned that Lopez would be so inhibitive. ” 
Komatsu, 67 Haw. at  494, 693 P.2d at  411. 
Even if all of the occupations listed by the ERS Board in 
FOF 47 were considered, the “danger or risk inh erent in, and 
concomitant to ” Quel’s “particular occupation or particular job, ” 
was “not a risk common to employment in general. ”  In this 
regard, the ERS Board also concluded in COL 22 that Quel  failed 
to introduce evidence that “the lifting requirements ” of her job 
                     
5  However, in Lopez , we noted that “[i]n the workers' compensation 
context, however, the appellant's mental infirmity would probably have been 
compensable.”  66 Haw. at 130 n.1, 130, 657 P.2d at 1042 n.1.  ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
17 
 were "different in character" from those in the occupations 
listed in FOF 47.  Even assuming the ERS Board meant  to include 
“repetitive use of hands ” in COL 22 as not being “different in 
character,” the ERS Board had also noted that Quel ’s job duties 
included placing rice into six or seven eight-inch pans and 
lifting them into and lowering them from an oven taller than 
her, emptying food out of stew pots, pinching dough, scooping 
rice with her left hand for about 250 trays, peeling potatoes, 
cutting vegetables, and
 opening numerous cans with an old-
fashioned manual can opener  instead of an electric can opener.  
The cumulative, repetitive work performed by Quel, 
especially without the proper equipment, which led to the 
serious injuries to her hands, wrists, and shoulders, requiring 
multiple surgeries to her shoulders , wrists, fingers,  and thumb, 
and resulting in her permanent incapacity for duty, is not “ a 
risk common to employment in general. ”  As in Komatsu , a 
determination of whether an “occupational hazard ” exists 
requires an analysis of whether a  specific work environment 
created the occupational hazard.  The nature of Quel ’s 
occupation or job, as well as the lack of proper equipment at 
her job site, both contributed to her injuries.   
 Thus, the “danger or risk ” “inherent in, and concomitant to ” 
Quel’s “particular occupation ” as a cafeteria helper, or to her 
“particular job ” at Helemano, was “not a risk common to ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***

 employment in general. ”  We therefore also hold the ERS Board 
erred in concluding Quel’s permanent incapacity did not result 
from “a danger or risk which is inherent in, and concomitant 
to,” her “particular occupation or job,” which was “not a risk 
common to employment in general.”  
V.  Conclusion 
Based on the reasons above, we vacate the ICA’s July 6, 
2018 judgment on appeal and the circuit court’s April 13, 2016 
(1) “Decision and Order Affirming the Final Decision of the 
Appellee Board of Trustees of the Employees’ Retirement System 
of the State of Hawaii and Dismissing Appellant Debbie S. Quel’s 
Appeal” and (2) final judgment.  We remand this case to the ERS 
Board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
