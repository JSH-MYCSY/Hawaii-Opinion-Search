OPINION OF THE COURT BY RECKTENWALD, C.J. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
 At issue is whether marital agreements that consider 
fault or misconduct when dividing the marital property are 
enforceable.  The parties entered into a post-marital agreement 
expressing, among other things, that if Joe Crofford (Husband) 
engaged in extramarital affairs or physically harmed his wife

 Kristi Adachi (Wife), Wife would receive most of the parties’ 
joint assets.  Husband contends on certiorari that the agreement 
is void because it violates 
Hawai‘i’s public policy favoring no-
fault divorce and equitable distribution of marital property.   
 We have not previously considered whether marital 
agreements that account for misconduct or fault when dividing the 
marital property are enforceable.  Upon review, we conclude these 
agreements are not enforceable.   
II. BACKGROUND 
The parties were married in 1999.1  At the time of their 
marriage, Wife owned significant assets, including two homes in 
Kailua, Hawai‘ i and a medical practice, Hawaiian Island ENT 
Specialists, Inc.  Husband did not have significant marital assets 
and owed more than $200,000.00 in past child support for two 
children from prior marriages.  Together, the parties have one 
child, who was twelve years old when they separated.  
Over the course of their marriage, Husband engaged in 
several extramarital affairs.  In March 2013, after Wife found Husband in bed on their yacht with another woman, Wife wanted to 
file for divorce.  Husband pleaded with Wife not to leave the

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

  marriage and proposed that the parties sign a postnuptial 
agreement, which Wife agreed to. 
 
In or around May 2013, Wife presented Husband with the 
first draft of the Marital Agreement, which provided that Husband would receive $200,000 in the event the parties divorced.
2  
Husband rejected the first draft and refused to make any edits to it.  About two months later, Wife sent Husband a second draft of 
the Marital Agreement.  Husband made handwritten edits to the 
second draft, but neither party executed the agreement.  Instead, 
the parties drafted a Marital Agreement Addendum (Addendum) to 
address the issues that Husband lined or struck out in the second draft.  The Addendum, which was primarily drafted by Husband, 
provided as follows: 
I, [Husband] on this date of June 24, 2013 propose this post-
nuptial agreement.  
 
I have been married to [Wife] since July 24, 1999. She was 
the love of my life until I did not feel important to her due to her career.  Instead of being the leader of the family in 
the godly way that I should have been, I acted out because of my sinful nature.  I have been unfaithful to my wife on 
numerous occasions. . . . I desire to break away from my 
destructive behaviors and truly become the man that our Lord 
Jesus Christ would want me to be.   . . . .
 
 I ask my wife for forgiveness for all my sins and will uphold 
my verbal, and now written promise to her regarding agreeing 
                     
2  Specifically, the first draft listed the parties’ two South Street 
apartments and their yacht as Wife’s separately owned property.  Moreover, the 
draft explained that, “[i] n lieu of any payments of maintenance, spousal 
support . . . or an interest in [Wife’s] separately owned property in the event of a divorce, [Wife] shall pay [Husband] the sum of $200,000.00[.]” *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 to leave this marriage with honor and dignity without 
monetary compensation if I a[m] unable [to] change my sinful 
ways.  Specifically, have another affair[,] either emotional 
or consummated, or physically harm [Wife]. 
 
In return, I ask of my wife to give me the [l]ove and 
[r]espect I so long for and to truly forgive my sins . . . I [also] ask her to spend more time with me[.]  
 
(Emphasis added.) 
Additionally, the Addendum addressed the allocation of 
certain property.  It explained: 
The Sunreef 62 foot Catamaran Yacht . . . will remain the property [of Husband] and will be put in [Husband’s] trust with [Wife] named as the beneficiary in the event of 
[Husband’s] [d]eath and will remain the property of the trust 
in the event of a divorce with exception in the case of 
infidelity and physical harm by [Husband].  At which time the 
[o]wnership of the Yacht Spartan Queen will be transferred to 
[Wife].  
 
The Penthouse 4501 located at One Waterfront Towers 415 South 
St. will remain in [Wife’s] [t]rust with [Husband] named as the [b]eneficiary. 
 
In the event of divorce with the exception of infidelity or 
physical harm by [Husband], [Husband] will maintain ownership 
of the [yacht], which has been effectively paid in full by 
[Wife].  All monies invested in the yacht up until November 2012 were contributions directly from money earned through 
[Wife’s] business . . . and will be considered monetary 
compensation for the years invested in this [m]arriage.  
[Husband] will waive any separation of property rights; 
except as described below and alimony.   
 
. . . .  
 
We will also both have to agree on all future financial decisions to secure our financial future together.  I accept her proposal to place the proceeds from the sale of apartment 
425 South Street in a [t]rust under both of our names. . . .  
In the event of a divorce, any monies gained or properties 
invested in will be split equally between the two of us; with 
the exception of infidelity and physical harm.  
 
(Emphases added.) *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 Wife executed the Addendum in the presence of a notary 
public on June 24, 2013 and Husband executed the Addendum in the 
presence of a notary public the following day.  Although Husband 
contested whether the Marital Agreement itself was properly executed, he acknowledged signing the Addendum.
3   
The parties separated in September 2013 after Husband 
exhibited aggressive behavior towards Wife.  Husband filed his 
Complaint for divorce on October 7, 2013 and Wife filed her Answer 
to Complaint for Divorce on November 18, 2013.   
A.  Family Court Proceedings  
Following a bench trial, the Family Court of the First 
Circuit4 entered its findings of fact and conclusions of law and 
decree granting absolute divorce and awarding child custody.  
First, the family court determined that Wife “never coerced or 
unduly influenced Husband to sign the Addendum.”  The family court 
also concluded that the parties entered into the Marital Agreement 
and Addendum voluntarily, and that Husband violated the infidelity 
conditions in the Addendum.  However, the family court held that 
the Marital Agreement and Addendum were unenforceable because “the 
essence of the Marital Agreement [and Addendum] violates the 
                     
3  Both the family court and the ICA concluded that the parties 
executed the A ddendum, which incorporated by reference the second draft of the 
Marital Agreement.  Crofford v. Adachi, 148 Hawai‘ i 535, 479 P.3d 153, 2020 WL 
7775540 at *2, *7 (App. Dec. 30, 2020) (mem. op.).

 statutory policy and principles of no fault divorce and equitable 
distribution.”  The family court divided the marital property 
based on what it determined would be just and equitable, rather 
than as set forth in the parties’ marital agreements.   
The family 
court relied upon a 2015 tax assessment valuation of the parties’ 
penthouse apartment submitted by Wife, which at $2,454,500, was 
almost $600,000 less than the value reached by a private appraiser 
that Husband and Wife jointly hired. 5
B.  Proceedings on Appeal 
The parties cross-appealed to the ICA.  On appeal, Wife 
argued that the family court erred in rejecting the Marital 
Agreement and Addendum.  Wife argued that “no Hawaii appellate 
court has ever held . . . that a marital agreement attaching 
contingencies of fault” renders the agreement unenforceable.  Wife 
explained that 
both the Hawaii appellate courts and courts in other 
jurisdictions have held that marital agreements in which the 
parties agree to a certain manner in which to divide and 
distribute marital property, effective upon one of the parties being unfaithful, are valid and enforceable even if 
the division of property is not otherwise “ equitable,” and 
even in light of public policy favoring no- fault divorces.
 
 
(Citing Balogh v. Balogh, 134 Hawaiʻ i 29, 43-45, 332 P.3d 631, 
645-47 (2014 ); In re Marriage of Tabassum & Younis, 881 N.E.2d 
                     
5  As noted by the ICA, under the M arital Agreement and Addendum, 
“[Husband] would at minimum receive the Acura MDX and half of the parties’ gold 
and silver.”  In its findings of fact, the family court valued the Acura MDX at 
$27,000 and the gold and silver at $174,000. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 396, 413 (Ill. App. Ct. 2007); Gilley v. Gilley, 778 S.W.2d 862, 
864 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1989)).  
Husband contended that Hawaiʻ i’s “no-fault divorce 
standards preclude enforcement of the [A
ddendum],” and allowing 
Wife “to ‘revive’ the long deceased, fault-based divorce by contract would frustrate the legislatively-expressed policy that the [f]amily [c]ourt should not waste its limited time and 
resources attempting to resolve competing claims of marital 
misconduct.”  Husband also argued that he signed the agreement 
involuntarily and that the agreement was unconscionable.  Finally, 
Husband argued that the family court abused its discretion in 
valuing the parties’ penthouse apartment at $2,454,500, based on 
the property’s 2015 tax assessment value, instead of $3,000,000, 
the value reached by a private appraiser that Husband and Wife 
agreed to hire. 
In a memorandum opinion, the ICA agreed with Wife, and 
concluded that the family court erred with regard to the Marital Agreement and Addendum’s enforceability.  The ICA explained that 
“[a]lthough Hawaiʻ i has implemente
 d a no-fault divorce scheme, 
there is no law that invalidates a marital agreement because it 
provides for distribution of marital property based on the conduct 
of the parties.”  Crofford v. Adachi, 148 Hawai‘ i 535, 479 P.3d 
153, 2020 WL 7775540 at *5 (App. Dec. 30, 2020) (mem. op.)   After *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 noting the family court’s finding that both Husband and Wife 
signed the Addendum and entered into the Marital Agreement by 
referencing it in the signed Addendum, the ICA concluded that the 
Marital Agreement and Addendum were valid and enforceable. 
Additionally, the ICA disagreed with Husband that the 
Marital Agreement and Addendum were unconscionable because it awarded almost all joint assets to Wife.  Noting that “the 
[Addendum] only contemplated an inequitable division of property 
if [Husband] had another affair or physically harmed [Wife],” 
the 
ICA found it “unlikely that the Marital Agreement and Addendum would have been construed by the parties as demonstrative of Husband’s commitment to the marriage if it had not contained the 
contingencies of fault and the resulting inequitable distribution 
of property.”  Id. at *8 
(citing Balogh, 134 Hawaiʻ i at 43, 332 
P.3d at 645) .  The ICA concluded:  
Given [Wife’s] contributions to the marriage, all of the 
circumstances at the time the Marital Agreement and Addendum 
were entered into, including the reasons for drafting the 
agreement and the provisions therein, the one- sided 
distribution of property contemplated by the postmarital agreement in the event [Husband] had another affair or 
physically harmed [Wife] is not “ so outrageously oppressive 
as to be unconscionable in the absence of unfair surprise.” 
Id. at *9 (quoting Balogh, 134 Hawai‘ i at 42-43, 332 P.3d at 644-
45). 
The ICA additionally held that the agreements were not 
procedurally unconscionable, finding no evidence of unfair *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
  
9 
 surprise.  The ICA noted that the Husband primarily drafted the 
Addendum and “there is no evidence that [Husband] did not have 
full knowledge or the chance to obtain full knowledge of [Wife’s] 
financial circumstances.”  Id. at *10. 
Finally, the ICA rejected Husband’s other points of 
error, including his challenges to “various aspects of the family court’s valuation of certain real and personal property, debts, 
and premarital contributions,” for failing to comply with the 
requirements of Hawai‘ i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 
28(b)(4).
6   Id. at *11.  The ICA stated that 
[Husband] fails to specifically address the findings of fact 
and conclusions of law that he lists in his points of error 
in his arguments.  We are left to speculate which finding or 
conclusion [Husband] seeks to address in his arguments, which 
we decline to do.    
 
Id. at *11. 
  The ICA concluded that Husband failed to argue his 
alleged points of error regarding the family court’s findings of 
fact and conclusions of law, and deemed them to be waived. 
The ICA vacated the family court’s property division 
awards and remanded to the family court to “enter a new property 
                     
6  HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) requires an appellant to state “(i) the alleged 
error committed by the court or agency; (ii) where in the record the alleged 
error occurred; and (iii) where in the record the alleged error was objected to 
or the manner in which the alleged error was brought to the attention of the 
court or agency.” *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 division award according to the parties’ agreement set forth in 
the [] Addendum. ”  Id. at *11. 
Husband sought review by this court, raising the 
following questions in his application for writ of certiorari: (1) whether a court may enforce a marital agreement that is contrary 
to the no-fault public policy in divorce proceedings; (2) whether 
the Marital Agreement and Addendum violated Hawai‘ i’s no-fault 
public policy, thus making it unenforceable; (3) whether the 
agreements are unconscionable because they award Wife 
approximately ninety-nine percent of the marital property; (4) 
whether the family court erred in rejecting the parties’ 
stipulation to the value of the parties’ jointly-owned penthouse; 
and (5) whether marital agreements between spouses should be 
subject to a higher standard pursuant to the rules governing 
fiduciary relationships.   
III.
 STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A.  Family Court Decisions  
  “[T]he family court possesses wide discretion in making 
its decisions and those decisions will not be set aside unless 
there is a manifest abuse of discretion.”  Kakinami v. Kakinami, 
127 Hawai‘ i 126, 136, 276 P.3d 695, 705 (2012) (citations 
omitted).  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
  
11 
 B.  
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law  
The family court’s findings of fact are reviewed under the 
clearly erroneous standard. A finding of fact is clearly 
erroneous when (1) the record lacks substantial evidence to 
support the finding, or (2) despite substantial evidence in 
support of the finding, the appellate court is nonetheless 
left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. Substantial evidence is credible evidence which is 
of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person 
of reasonable caution to support a conclusion. The family 
court’s conclusions of law are reviewed de novo.  
 
Balogh, 134 Hawai‘ i at 38, 332 P.3d at 640 (quoting Kakinami, 127 
Hawai‘i at 136, 276 P.3d at 705) (internal quotation marks 
omitted).  
C.  Construction of a Marital Agreement  
The construction and legal effect to be given a contract is a 
question of law freely reviewable by an appellate court. 
Unconscionability is a question of law this court reviews de 
novo. Whether particular circumstances are sufficient to 
constitute . . . duress is a question of law, although the 
existence of those circumstances is a question of fact.  
 
Id. at 37-38, 332 P.3d at 639-40 (citations, brackets and internal 
quotation marks omitted).  
IV. DISCUSSION  
A. The Marital Agreement and Addendum are Contrary to Public 
Policy  
 
1.  Hawai‘i has adopted a no-fault approach to divorce 
proceedings, which extends to the division of marital property 
 
In 1972, the legislature amended  Revised 
Statutes (HRS) § 580-41 (2018), the statute governing divorce 
proceedings, to eliminate the requirement that a party filing for Hawai‘i*** FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST’S  HAWAI ‘I REPORTS  AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***
12 (1)The marriage is irretrievably broken;
(2)The parties have lived separate and apart under a decree
of separation from bed and board entered by any
 court of
competent jurisdiction, the term of separation has expired,
and no reconciliation has been effected;
(3)The parties have lived separate and apart for a period
of two years or more under a decree of separate maintenance
entered by any court of competent jurisdiction, and no
reconciliation has been effected; or
(4)The parties have lived separate and apart for a continuous
period of two years or more immediately  preceding the application,
there is no reasonable likelihood that cohabitation will beresumed, and the court is satisfied that, in the particularcircumstances of the
 case, it would not be harsh and oppressive to
the defendant or contrary to the public interest to a divorce onthis ground on the complaint of the plaintiff.
7The previous iteration of HRS § 580- 41 provided that “[d]ivorces 
from the bond of matrimony shall be granted for the causes hereinafter set 
forth and no other,” and provided an exhaustive list of reasons related to 
fault.  1970 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 
116, § 1 at 223.   divorce show marital misconduct on the part of their spouse.   At a 
House Judiciary Committee hearing, Family Court Judge Betty Vitousek 
offered the following rationale in favor of no-fault divorce: 
“Unnecessary disputes over fault, where one party to the divorce 
action must be the accuser and the other the accused, lead to counter-
spouse antagonism which, particularly when the parties have children, 
further aggravates their differences.”  H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1172,
in 1972 House Journal, at 637.  As amended, HRS § 580-41 now mandates 
that divorce is appropriate “upon the application of either party” if 
the court finds: 7
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
  
13 
 HRS § 580-41.8 
Even before the legislature’s enactment of Hawai‘ i’s no-
fault divorce policy, however, this court had already held that a 
person’s conduct during the marriage was irrelevant to the 
division of marital property.  See Richards v. Richards, 44 Haw. 
491, 509, 355 P.2d 188, 198-99 (1960) (“Personal conduct of the 
spouses toward each other is material to the establishment of a 
ground for divorce.  But it has no bearing on the question as to 
which spouse has a better claim to the property sought to be 
divided in a divorce proceeding.” (emphasis added)).  And 
following Richards, our courts have continued to hold that fault 
should not be considered in the division of marital property upon 
divorce.   See, e.g., Hatayama v. Hatayama, 9 Haw. App. 1, 11-12, 
818 P.2d 277, 282 (1991) (holding that the parties’ relative contributions during marriage did not authorize a deviation from an equal division of marital property); Gordon v. Gordon, 135 
Hawai‘i 340, 353, 350 P.3d 1008, 1021 (2015) (holding, inter alia, 
that husband’s “financial misconduct during the marriage should 
not have been considered by the family court when deciding whether 
to deviate from an equal division of marital partnership property 
in the absence of a finding of extraordinary circumstances”).   
                     
8  HRS § 580- 41 has remained unchanged as amended.  See 1972 Haw. 
Sess. Laws Act 11, § 1 at 165- 66.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
  
14 
 In Hatayama, the ICA specifically construed 
Hawai‘i’s 
no-fault approach to divorce to include the principle that 
parties’ contributions and conduct during marriage are generally 
irrelevant to the division of marital assets upon divorce: 
Divorce is not a vehicle by which one spouse is compensated 
for having given more than he or she received during the 
marriage or for having had to suffer during the marriage from 
the other spouse’s inadvertent, negligent, or intentional 
inadequacies, failures, or wrongdoings, financial or otherwise. . . . If such evidence was relevant, each spouse 
would be well- advised to prepare from the date of the 
marriage for the possibility of a divorce by meticulously 
keeping score in a daily diary.  The trial would be a contest 
of diaries and experts.  Allowing it to be such a vehicle 
would be contrary to the public policy in favor of loving, 
trusting, harmonious marriages and no-fault divorces.  
 
Hatayama, 9 Haw. App. at 11-12, 818 P.2d at 282 (emphases added). 
In this way, our courts have recognized that Hawai‘ i’s 
no-fault divorce policy extends to disputes over how marital 
property should be divided. 
2. The Marital Agreement and Addendum violate Hawai‘ i’s no-
fault divorce policy by requiring that the family court 
make a determination of whether one party engaged in misconduct 
 
As a general rule, postnuptial agreements between 
spouses are valid in 
Hawai‘i.  See HRS § 572-22(c) (Supp. 2019) 
(“All contracts made between spouses, whenever made . . . and not 
otherwise invalid because of any other law, shall be valid.”); 
Balogh, 134 Hawaiʻ i at 32, 332 P.3d at 634 (affirming a married 
couple’s right to contract).  However, as with any other contract, *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
  
15 
 a postnuptial agreement must be made for a lawful purpose and must 
not be contrary to public policy.  See, e.g., Yin v. Aguiar, 146
 
Hawai‘i 254, 270, 463 P.3d 911, 927 (2020) (“When evaluating the
 
validity of [contract] clauses, we examine whether they violate 
public policy.” (cleaned up)).  Public policy “may . . . derive 
from numerous sources including constitutional provisions, statutory provisions, or the common law.”  Id. at 270, 463 P.3d at 
927 (emphasis added).   
The ICA here cited Balogh and its general affirmation of 
marital contracts to hold that the Marital Agreement and Addendum 
were valid and enforceable.  In Balogh, following a period of 
marital tension, husband and wife signed two agreements stating that “if they separated, [wife] would receive seventy-five percent 
of the profit from the sale of the property, the contents of their home . . . , all of their vehicles, and $100,000 from [husband] in lieu of alimony and court proceedings.”  Balogh, 134 Hawaiʿi at 
32, 332 P.3d at 634 (emphasis added).9  On appeal, we concluded 
that the parties’ handwritten agreement was enforceable and the 
family court “must enforce all valid and enforceable postmarital 
and separation agreements.”  Id. at 40, 332 P.3d at 642 (citing 
Epp v. Epp, 80 Hawai‘ i 79, 87, 905 P.2d 54, 62 (App. 1995)).   
                     
9  Significantly, the agreement in Balogh was contingent on 
separation, not misconduct, and did not necessitate a balancing of the spouses’ 
interest in contracting against Hawai‘ i’s policy of no- fault divorce.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
  
16 
 Citing Balogh, the ICA in this case held that the 
parties’ marital agreement, which was “freely entered into,” 
should override the mandate of Hawai‘ i’s no-fault divorce scheme 
that spousal conduct be disregarded in determining the division of 
marital assets.  Crofford, 2020 WL 7775540 at *5.  The ICA 
reasoned that  
Although Hawai‘ i has implemented a no- fault divorce scheme, 
there is no law that invalidates a marital agreement because 
it provides for the distribution of marital property based on 
the conduct of the parties.  Rather, given the explicit 
provisions of HRS § 572- 22, and as recognized by the supreme 
court, spouses may contract regarding marital property rights 
in premarital, postmarital, or settlement agreements, and the 
family court must enforce all valid and enforceable 
agreements with regard to marital property division.   
 
Id. at *5 (emphasis added) (citing Balogh, 134 Hawai‘ i at 39 n.4, 
332 P.3d at 641 n.4) . 
Respectfully, we disagree with the ICA’s application of 
Balogh to this case.  Unlike the agreement in Balogh, the Marital 
Agreement and Addendum here are contingent on the conduct of the 
parties, necessitating a determination of whether one party 
engaged in misconduct.  Although, in this case, Husband did not 
contest that he violated the terms of the agreement, if he did, 
the family court would have had to consider the parties’ evidence 
of alleged fault in determining whether the agreement was 
violated.  Such a result would conflict with the legislature’s 
interest in “avoid[ing] abrasive evidence in divorce proceedings,” *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
  
17 
 S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 415, in 1971 Senate Journal, at 971, and 
turn the parties’ divorce trial into the “contest of diaries and 
experts” denounced by the ICA in Hatayama.  9 Haw. App. at 11-12, 
818 P.2d at 282.   
In conclusion, the ICA erred in holding that the Marital 
Agreement and Addendum here are valid and enforceable.  Because 
the agreements require the family court to make determinations of 
fault, they violate Hawai‘ i’s policy of no-fault divorce.  We 
therefore hold that the agreements are void and unenforceable. 
3. Case law from other jurisdictions supports that the 
agreements here are void and unenforceable as a matter 
of public policy 
 
Although jurisdictions are split on whether postnuptial 
agreements that premise property division on a spouse’s infidelity 
violate the public policy of no-fault divorce, a number of states 
have held that such agreements are void or unenforceable as a matter of public policy.  For example, in In re Marriage of 
Cooper, the parties entered into a reconciliation agreement after 
wife learned husband was having an extramarital affair.  769 
N.W.2d 582 (Iowa 2009).  The agreement, which was signed and 
notarized, provided that husband would “accept full 
responsibilities [for his] action” in the event his “indiscretions 
le[d] to” a divorce, and required that husband make payments and provide for certain financial arrangements in the event of *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 divorce.  Id. at 584.  Soon thereafter, husband left the marital 
home, moved to his own apartment, and admitted he continued his 
prior affair even after signing the reconciliation agreement.  Id.  
The Iowa Supreme Court concluded that this agreement violated 
Iowa’s public policy, stating that “[a] unifying theme of our 
historic case law is that contracts which attempt to regulate the 
conduct of spouses during the marital relationship are not 
enforceable.”  Id. at 586.  In order to avoid “empower[ing] 
spouses to seek an end-run around [its] no-fault divorce laws through private contracts,” id. at 587, and “creat[ing] a 
bargaining environment where sexual fidelity or harmonious 
relationships are key variables,” id. at 586, the court held that 
the agreement in Cooper was void.   
The reasoning of Cooper is instructive here.  Like the 
agreement in Cooper, the M arital Agreement and Addendum here have  
“as a condition precedent the sexual conduct of the parties within 
the marital relationship.”  Id. at 586.  And like Iowa’s no-fault 
divorce law, which was “designed to limit acrimonious 
proceedings,” id. at 587, Hawai‘i’s divorce statutes were crafted 
with the purpose of “avoid[ing] abrasive evidence in divorce 
proceedings.”  See Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 415, in 1971 Senate 
Journal, at 971.  Despite these similarities, the ICA here 
distinguished Cooper by arguing that Iowa courts have broader *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 discretion than Hawai‘ i courts in accepting or denying a parties’ 
marital agreement.  Crofford, 2020 WL 7775540 at *6.  The ICA 
pointed out that unlike the Iowa Supreme Court, which recognized 
that “[t]here is no provision of Iowa statutory law that expressly 
authorizes or prohibits enforcement of reconciliation agreements,” 
see Cooper, 769 N.W.2d at 585, this court has expressly recognized 
a married couple’s right to “contract regarding marital property 
rights” under HRS § 572-22.  Crofford, 2020 WL 7775540 at *5 
(citing Balogh, 134 Hawai‘ i at 39 n.4, 332 P.3d at 641 n.4). 
HRS § 572-22 does not specifically address whether an 
agreement that allows marital couples to consider fault in the separation of their property is unenforceable because it 
contravenes Hawai‘ i’s no-fault approach to divorce proceedings.  
However, HRS § 572-22 does expressly limit the enforceability of 
marital contracts to those “not otherwise invalid because of any 
other law.”  The ICA therefore erred in holding that HRS § 572-22 
authorized the enforcement of the agreements here.  In this case, 
the family court would have to determine whether, under the 
agreements’ terms and contrary to the purpose of the no-fault 
statute, Husband truly “change[d] [his] sinful ways.”  Moreover, 
the court would have to evaluate whether Wife’s promises to forgive him and spend more time with him were fulfilled.  Because 
the Marital Agreement and Addendum here require the family court *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
  
20 
 to evaluate the parties’ fault, the agreements are contrary to 
Hawai‘i’s no-fault divorce policy and must be voided.   
California has also concluded that marital agreements 
with infidelity clauses are unenforceable.  I n Diosdado v. 
Diosdado, 118 Cal. Rptr. 2d 494 (Cal. Ct. App. 2002).  There, a 
California appellate court concluded that  a provision in a marital 
agreement providing payment of liquidated damages to one spouse if 
the other was “sexually unfaithful” was unenforceable.10  Id. at 
494.  The facts in Diosdado are similar to those here: After 
learning husband was having an affair, the parties entered into a 
written marital settlement agreement.  Id. at 494-95.  After 
signing the agreement, husband was again unfaithful and the parties separated.  Id. at 495-96.  The court concluded that 
enforcement of the agreement would require that the court “penalize the party who is at fault for having breached the obligation of sexual fidelity, and whose breach provided the basis 
for terminating the marriage.  This penalty is in direct 
                     
10  The ICA distinguished this case for similar reasons as it did 
Cooper.  The ICA noted that “there does not appear to be any California statute 
similar to HRS § 572- 22” and that the California Supreme Court instead relied 
on a statute requiring a contract to have a “lawful object.”  Crofford, 2020 WL 
7775540 at *6.  But, as with Cooper, this difference, although significant, 
does not answer the question of whether Hawaiʻ i public policy renders the 
agreement invalid.
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
  
21 
 contravention of the public policy underlying no-fault divorce.”  
Id. at 496. 11 
Here, the Addendum stated, among other things, that 
Husband would leave the marital home “without monetary 
compensation” if he was “unable [to] change [his] sinful ways.”  
Similar to the liquidated damages provision in Diosdado, enforcing 
the Addendum would require that the court “penalize the party who is at fault for having breached the obligation of sexual fidelity, 
and whose breach provided the basis for terminating the marriage.”  
Diosdado, 118 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 496.   
Finally, Nevada also rejects marital agreements that 
consider fault or marital misconduct in the division of property.  In Parker v. Green, No. 73176, 2018 WL 3211974 (Nev. June 25, 
2018), the Nevada Supreme Court addressed a marital agreement expressing that “[husband] would pay [wife] $2,500 per month, 
                     
11  The California Supreme Court had previously rejected the idea that 
married couples have absolute freedom of contract in a case involving the 
enforceability of baseball player Barry Bonds’ prenuptial agreement.  See In re 
Marriage of Bonds, 5 P.3d 815 (Cal. 2000).  Significantly, Diosdado quoted the 
following passage from Bonds:  
[M]arriage itself is a highly regulated institution of 
undisputed social value, and there are many limitations on 
the ability of persons to contract with respect to it . . . 
that have nothing to do with maximizing the satisfaction of 
the parties or carrying out their intent. . . . These 
limitations demonstrate further that freedom of contract with 
respect to marital arrangements is tempered with statutory 
requirements and case law expressing social policy with 
respect to marriage.  
Diosdado, 118 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 497 (quoting In re Marriage of Bonds, 5 P.3d at 
829-30) (emphasis added).  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
  
22 
 until death or remarriage, if the parties permanently ended their 
relationship based on [husband’s] infidelity or dishonesty.”  Id. 
at *1.  The court construed the contract as providing the wife alimony in the event the parties separated, and nonetheless held, “just as infidelity is not an appropriate consideration for 
divorce, it is also an inappropriate consideration when 
determining an alimony award.”  Id. at *3 (citing Rodriguez v. 
Rodriguez, 13 P.3d 415, 418 (Nev. 2000)). 
Other courts have, however, enforced marital agreements 
that account for misconduct when dividing marital property.  In Laudig v. Laudig, 624 A.2d 651 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1993), husband and 
wife entered into a postnuptial agreement after husband learned of 
wife’s infidelities.  The agreement provided, among other things, 
that if wife engaged in sexual intercourse with anyone other than 
husband within a period of fifteen years, wife would “sign all of 
her right, title and interest in and to any marital property . . . 
to [husband] in consideration for the payment of the sum of Ten 
Thousand ($10,000.00) Dollars and the sum of One Thousand 
($1,000.00) Dollars each and every year thereafter for the 
following fifteen years.”  Id. at 652.  Wife again was unfaithful, 
and the husband sought to enforce the postnuptial agreement during 
the divorce proceedings.  The Superior Court of Pennsylvania held 
that “[o]ne of the recognized purposes of marital agreements is to *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
  
23 
 allow the parties to avoid the operation of equitable 
distribution,” and “[m]arital agreements allow parties to dispose 
of their property rights regardless of the reasons . . . . If such 
property rights can be transferred without providing any reason to support the transfer, there should be no reason why a transfer 
would be invalid if it be conditioned on the occurrence of a 
specified type of conduct.”  Id. at 655.  The Superior Court of 
Pennsylvania thus rejected wife’s argument that the agreement was unenforceable because it violated Pennsylvania’s public policy.  
However, since Pennsylvania allowed married couples to file for 
divorce based on fault, id. at 652, the court’s reasoning in 
Laudig is less persuasive in a no-fault state such as Hawai‘ i.  
Similarly, Tennessee has held that marital agreements 
that account for misconduct in the division of property are enforceable.  In Gilley v. Gilley, the Court of Appeals of 
Tennessee concluded that a reconciliation agreement executed after 
wife learned husband was having an affair did not violate 
Tennessee’s public policy favoring the preservation of marital 
relations.  778 S.W.2d 862, 862 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1989).  The 
reconciliation agreement “provided that in the event of divorce 
husband would convey to wife his interest in a corporation owned 
by the parties.”  Id. at 863.  Husband argued that the agreement 
was unenforceable because it violated Tennessee’s public policy *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
  
24 
 favoring the “preservation of marital relations” and the equitable 
division of property.  Id. at 864.  The court disagreed, and 
instead concluded that the reconciliation agreement was intended “to encourage marital fidelity on the part of the husband by setting forth, prior to reconciliation, the outcome of a divorce 
should one occur.”  Id.  However, this case is not persuasive 
because the public policy considerations that husband raised pertained to the “preservation of marital relations,” not a no-
fault approach to divorce proceedings.   
Although the jurisdictions that have considered this 
issue are split, those courts that have found such agreements unenforceable have policies and divorce schemes that resemble our 
own.  California and Iowa have both adopted strong policies 
favoring a no-fault approach to divorce proceedings.  Moreover, we
have previously adopted California’s approach to the 
enforceability of prenuptial agreements.  See L.R.O. v. N.D.O., 
148  336, 350, 475 P.3d 1167, 1181 (2020) (citing with 
approval In re Marriage of Bonds, 5 P.3d 815 (Cal. 2000)).  And, 
although not dispositive, case law from this jurisdiction 
generally supports the elimination of fault in the division of 
property.  See Richards, 44 Haw. at 509, 355 P.2d at 198-99; Horst
v. Horst, 1 Haw. App. 617, 624, 623 P.2d 1265, 1271-72 (1981).  While those cases did not involve a marital agreement - and Hawai‘i 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
  
25 
 therefore did not consider a marital couple’s right to contract 
under HRS § 572-22 - they nonetheless reinforce Hawai
‘i’s strong 
policy favoring no-fault divorce proceedings, including when 
dividing marital property.  Prior caselaw thus supports that the 
Marital Agreement and Addendum are unenforceable, and that the ICA
erred by holding otherwise.   
Since we reject the Marital Agreement and Addendum on 
public policy grounds, we decline to opine on whether the agreements were also substantively or procedurally unconscionable. 
B.  Husband’s Additional Challenges on Appeal are Meritless 
After finding that the Marital Agreement and Addendum 
were unenforceable, the family court considered the value of the 
marital assets when separating the parties’ assets in a just and 
equitable manner under HRS § 580-74.  In doing so, the family 
court rejected the parties’ private appraisal submitted to the court valuing the parties’ penthouse property at $3,000,000.  
Instead, the family court valued the penthouse at the tax-assessed 
value of $2,454,500.  Husband’s contention that the family court 
erred in doing so is without merit.  
 
 The family court “possesses wide discretion” when 
determining the value of marital assets.  Kakinami, 127 Hawai‘ i at  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
  
26 
 136, 276 P.3d at 705.  In this case, the family court found that 
the parties mutually agreed to hire a private appraiser, that they 
did not agree to be bound by the resulting appraisal,  and that 
they did not include the appraisal in their exhibits or admit it 
into evidence.  In light of these findings, which Husband does not 
challenge here,  the family court acted within its discretion in 
relying upon the penthouse’s tax-assessed value of $2,454,500.  
 1312
  Finally, Husband argues that this court should adopt the 
dissent’s reasoning in Balogh, and hold that the “confidential 
relationship between spouses should require [postmarital] 
contracts to be subjected to a fiduciary standard to protect spouses against self-dealing and overreaching by the more dominant 
spouse.”  134 Hawai‘ i at 54, 332 P.3d at 656 (Pollack, J. 
dissenting).  Because we hold that the Marital Agreement and 
Addendum violate public policy and are therefore unenforceable, we need not consider whether such a heightened standard is necessary. 
                     
12   Wife had testified at trial that “[t] here’s no agreement or 
stipulation they were agreeing to the appraised value.”   
 
13  The ICA held that Husband failed to argue and therefore waived his 
points of error regarding the family court’s findings.  On appeal, Husband does 
not argue that this was in error.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 V.
 CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, the ICA’s February 3, 2021 
Judgment on Appeal is vacated.  This case is remanded to the 
family court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
