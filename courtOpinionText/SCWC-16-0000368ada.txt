2 retirement benefits after suffering a back injury.  Following 
various administrative proceedings, Respondent/Appellee-
Appellee/Cross-Appellant Employees’ Retirement System, State of 
Hawaiʻi (ERS) issued a proposed decision on October 11, 2011 
denying Watanabe’s application on the merits and notifying 
Watanabe that the decision would become final unless Watanabe 
filed exceptions within fifteen days.  On October 26, 2011, ERS 
received a document filed by Watanabe entitled “Petitioner’s 
Proposed Decision,” which was a copy of ERS’s own proposed 
decision with multiple underscored insertions and a single 
“lined out” paragraph.  This case centers on whether the 
document filed by Watanabe — Petitioner’s Proposed Decision — 
constituted exceptions. 
 Almost two years after Watanabe’s filing, ERS contacted 
Watanabe to schedule an exceptions hearing, but reserved the 
issue of whether Watanabe’s filing actually constituted 
exceptions.  Following the hearing, the ERS Board i ssued a 
final decision concluding that Watanabe’s filing did not 
constitute exceptions and confirming its denial of his 
application. 
Watanabe appealed to the Circuit Court of the Third 
Circuit (circuit court), arguing both the merits of his 
disability claim and that the ERS Board’s proposed decision did  
 
 
 
 
***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
3 not automatically become a final decision because Watanabe had
timely filed exceptions.  The circuit court affirmed the ERS 
Board’s decision without ruling on whether Watanabe’s filing 
constituted exceptions.  
Watanabe appealed to the Intermediate Court of Appeals
(ICA).  The ICA held that Petitioner’s Proposed Decision did not
constitute exceptions and affirmed the circuit court’s decision. 
 
   
In his application for writ of certiorari, Watanabe  
maintains that Petitioner’s Proposed Decision filing constituted
exceptions and that the ICA and ERS misinterpreted the 
administrative rule to require a rigid format for exceptions, 
thus denying Watanabe a meaningful opportunity to be heard.  
To resolve this case, we must consider what level of 
formality Hawai ʻi 
Administrative Rules (HAR) § 6-23-19 requires 
for exceptions.  Section 6-23-19 specifies that any party may 
file exceptions to a proposed decision and request review within
fifteen days.  In Hawaii Laborers’ Training Ctr. v. Agsalud
, 65 
Haw. 257, 259, 650 P.2d 574, 576 (1982), this court held that an
agency’s refusal to consider an 
appellant’s timely filed 
exceptions based on the agency’s rigid interpretation of its own
rule violated Hawaiʻi’s Administrative Procedures Act (APA).   
 
 
In this case, Watanabe met the minimum requirements 
for exceptions because he : (1) filed within fifteen days of the   
 
 
 
 
***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
4 agency’s proposed decision; (2)  specified his points of 
exception by either striking through, or, inserting underscored
text in the agency’s proposed decision; and (3) for several of 
the points, cited to exhibits in the record.  Having timely 
filed his exceptions, Watanabe was entitled to present argument
on his exceptions to the ERS Board and to have the Board 
consider the merits of his exceptions.   
 
  Accordingly, we vacate the I CA’s August 20, 2019 
Judgment on Appeal which affirmed the circuit court’s 
April 5, 2016 (1) Decision and Order Affirming the Final 
Decision of the ERS Board 
and Dismissing Appellant Watanabe’s 
Appeal; and (2) Final Judgment.  We remand this case to the ERS
Board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  
I.  BACKGROUND  
On November 24, 2008, Watanabe applied for 
service-connected disability retirement benefits for an injury
that occurred on January 25, 2005.   
Prior to his application for disability retirement, 
Watanabe worked as a Carpenter I for the State for more than ten
years.  
A. Administrative Proceedings  
By letter dated March 25, 2010, the ERS Board notified
Watanabe that it proposed to deny his application based on its   
 
 
 
 
***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
5 (continued . . .)  determination that Watanabe’s injury was not service-connected.
Watanabe retained counsel
 and brought a contested case 
proceeding to appeal 
the ERS Board’s preliminary determination .
Following the contested case hearing, an ERS hearing officer 
issued a Recommended Decision
 recommending that the ERS Board 
affirm its preliminary decision denying Watanabe’s application 
because Watanabe failed to establish that his permanent 
incapacity was work- related.   
  
The ERS Board adopt ed the hearing o fficer’s 
Recommended Decision as its Proposed Decision dated 
October 11, 2011 (ERS Board’s Proposed Decision) .  The ERS Board
mailed a copy of its Proposed Decision to Watanabe’s counsel by 
certified mail.  Both the ERS Board’s Proposed Decision and 
accompanying cover letter 
informed Watanabe that, under 
HAR § 6- 23-19, parties may file exceptions and request review 1 
                                                 
1 HAR § 6- 23-19 (2009) states:  
 
(a) Within fifteen days after receipt of a copy of 
the board’s proposed decision, any party may file 
with the board exceptions to any part thereof and 
request review by the board. Each exception shall 
specify the portion of the record and authorities 
relied on to sustain each point. Eight copies of the 
exceptions and request for review shall be filed with 
the board. In addition, a copy of the exceptions and 
request for review shall be served upon each of the 
parties who were served with a copy of the proposed 
decision.  
 
(b) Any party may apply for an extension of time 
within which to file exceptions to the proposed  
 
 
 
 
***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
6 within fifteen days of receipt.  In addition, both documents 
advised Watanabe that he could apply for an extension of time to
file exceptions, but that if no exceptions or extension was 
received within fifteen days of receipt of the ERS Board’s 
Proposed Decision, “the Proposed Decision shall become final.”  
Watanabe’s counsel received the ERS Board’s Proposed Decision  on
October 17, 2011.   
 
On October 25, 2011, Watanabe’s counsel filed a  letter
and document entitled “Petitioner’s Proposed Decision .”  The 
cover letter sent with Petitioner’s Proposed Decision stated 
only:  
Dear Sir/Madam:  
This is Petitioner’s Proposed Decision.  The changes
are underlined or lined out.   
 
Please do not hesitate to call should you have any
questions.   
 
The enclosed Petitioner’s Proposed Decision was a copy of the
ERS Board’s Proposed Decision, with multiple underscored  
                                                 
 (continued . . .) 
decision by filing two copies of a written  
application setting forth the reasons for the request.
The application shall be filed before the expiration 
of the period prescribed for the filing of exceptions.
Upon good cause shown, the board, or any member of 
the board, may extend the time for filing exceptions 
for an additional period not to exceed fifteen days.   
 
 
(c) If no exceptions and request for review are filed
within the time specified, the proposed decision 
shall become final, unless the board on its own 
motion orders further proceedings to be held.    
 
 
 
 
***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
7 insertions and a single “lined out” paragraph.  
By letter dated July 10, 2013 — almost two years after
Watanabe filed Petitioner’s Proposed Decision —  the ERS Board 
notified Watanabe’s counsel that it would contact him to 
schedule an exceptions hearing.  The letter informed Watanabe 
that the ERS Board s till had “ substantial questions as to 
whether the documents [Watanabe] submitted to the ERS by letter 
dated October 25, 2011, constituted ‘exceptions’  and/or complied
with the requirements of [HAR § 6-23-19]” and that the ERS Board
was reserving the issue.   
 
 
By letter dated May 15 , 2014, the ERS Board notified 
Watanabe and the State that it had “substantial doubts as to  
whether the October 25, 2011 letter and Petitioner’s Proposed 
Decision qualify as exceptions to the Proposed Decision and a 
request for review under HAR § 6 -23-19[]” and that ERS was 
reserving the issue.  The letter advised the parties to prepare
to offer argument at the hearing on all issues, including inter
alia, whether Petitioner’s Proposed Decision qualified as 
exceptions and a request for review under HAR § 6-23-19 and the
merits of Watanabe’s exceptions.   
 
 
Following an exceptions hearing,  the ERS Board issued
its Final Decision o n January 14, 2015.  In its Final Decision,
the ERS Board found that Petitioner’s Proposed Decision did not 
 
  
 
 
 
 
***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
8 constitute exceptions under HAR § 6-23-19 and thus the ERS 
Board’s Proposed Decision bec
ame a final decision.  Accordingly,
the ERS Board “confirm[ed] its denial of [Watanabe’s] 
application for service-connected disability retirement 
benefits.”
  
B. Circuit Court Proceedings  
  On February 13, 2015, Watanabe filed a Notice of 
Appeal to the circuit court.   Before the circuit court, Watanabe
argued that the ERS Board’s conclusion that he was not entitled 
to service-connected disability retirement benefits was clearly 
erroneous.  2  
ERS argued that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction 
over the ERS Board’s Proposed Decision denying Watanabe’s 
application because Watanabe failed to timely appeal.  ERS 
maintained that because Watanabe did not file exceptions in 
conformance with HAR § 6
-23-19, the ERS Board’s Proposed 
Decision became final on November 1, 2011 — fifteen days after 
it was served on Watanabe.  Thus, ERS claimed that Watanabe’s 
appeal was untimely because it was not filed within thirty days 
after November 1, 2011.  ERS contended that, even if the circuit3
 
                                                 
2 The Honorable Greg K. Nakamura presided.  
 
3 ERS argued that Petitioner’s Proposed Decision did not satisfy the 
requirements of HAR § 6 -23-19(a), because the filing failed to specify the 
portion of the record and authorities upon which it relied.   
 
 
 
 
***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
9 court found that Petitioner’s Proposed Decision constituted 
exceptions and his appeal was timely, Watanabe still failed to
prove that his permanent incapacity was work-related.    
In response to ERS’s claim that the circuit court 
lacked jurisdiction to review  the ERS Board’s Proposed Decision,
Watanabe argued that his appeal was timely because he filed 
Petitioner’s Propose d Decision, which met the published 
requirements of HAR § 6- 23-19(a) for exceptions.  Watanabe 
asserted that, pursuant to HAR § 6-23 -21, once he filed 
exceptions, the ERS Board’s Proposed Decision could not become a
final decision until the ERS Board held a hearing on his 
exceptions and rendered a final, written decision.
 4 
 
Following a hearing, the circuit court entered its 
Decision and Order Affirming the Final Decision of the ERS Board
(Circuit Court Decision).  The circuit court made no explicit 
finding as to whether Petitioner ’s Proposed Decision satisfied 
the requirements of HAR § 6-23 -19(a) for exceptions.   5 
                                                 
4 HAR § 6- 23-21 provides in relevant part : 
 
(a) Where exceptions have been filed  to the board’s 
proposed decision, the board, within sixty days after the 
hearing on the exceptions, shall render its final decision.  
 
(Emphasis added.) 
 
5 Presumably, the circuit court concluded that the Petitioner’s Proposed 
Decision did not constitute exceptions within the meaning  of HAR § 6 -23-19(a) 
because it omitted any reference to this filing in the Circuit Court Decision.   
 
 
 
 
***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
10 Nonetheless, the circuit court proceeded to address the merits 
of Watanabe’s disability claim.  The circuit court concluded 
that the ERS Board’s determinations in its Final Decision  were
supported by substantial evidence and not clearly  erroneous.  
Accordingly, the circuit court aff irmed the ERS Board’s Final 
Decision and entered Final Judgment in favor of ERS.  6 
C. ICA Proceedings  
Watanabe timely filed a notice of appeal and ERS filed
a notice of cross-appeal.   
On appeal, Watanabe argued that the circuit court 
erred by affirming the ERS Board’s Final Decision and that ERS’s
interpretation that Petitioner’s Proposed Decision did not 
qualify as exceptions under HAR § 6-23-19 was not entitled to 
deference.  
In its cross- appeal, ERS claimed that (1) the circuit
court erred by reaching the merits of Watanabe’s claim without 
first determining that it had appellate jurisdiction; and 
(2) neither the ICA nor the circuit court 
had jurisdiction to 
review the ERS Board’s Proposed Decision because Watanabe’s  
                                                 
6 The Circuit Court Decision affirmed the ERS Board’s Final Decision  but
treated the Final Decision  as adopting the ERS Board’s findings of fact and 
conclusions of law from the ERS Board’s Proposed  Decision.  While the ERS 
Board’s Final Decision did not expressly state that it adopted the Proposed 
Decision, it did attach the Proposed Decision  as an exhibit to its Final 
Decision.  In addition, the ERS Board’s Final Decision “confirm[ed]” the ERS
Board’s previous denial of  Watanabe’s application.   
  
 
 
 
 
***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
11 appeal to the circuit court was untimely.  
The ICA filed a  Summary Disposition Order on 
July 26, 2019.  First, the ICA addressed ERS’s cross -appeal 
challenging the circuit court’s lack of jurisdiction over the 
merits of Watanabe’s application for service -connected 
disability benefits.  As a threshold issue, t he ICA concluded 
that Petitioner’s Proposed Decision did not constitute 
exceptions under HAR § 6-23-19, because it failed to state that 
it was an appea l, identify any points of error or portion of the
record, contain any argument, or cite any authorities.  Based on
its conclusion that Watanabe failed to file exceptions, the ICA 
reasoned that the ERS Board’s Proposed Decision became final on 
November 1, 2011.  Thus, the ICA concluded that because Watanabe
did not appeal to the circuit court within thirty days of 
November 1, 2011, the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to 
review the merits of Watanabe’s claim.   
 
 
Second, the ICA held that the circuit court had 
jurisdiction only to review  the procedural matters addressed by 
the ERS Board in its January 14, 2015 Final Decision — namely, 
whether Watanabe had timely filed exceptions.  Accordingly, the 
ICA held that the circuit court erred in addressing the merits 
of Watanabe’s claim , but that the error was harmless because the
circuit court affirmed the ERS Board’s Final Decision.    
 
 
 
 
***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
12 Therefore, the ICA affirmed the Circuit Court’s
Decision and Final Judgment.  
II.  STANDARDS OF REVIEW  
A. Secondary Appeals  
 Review of a decision made by the circuit court upon 
its review of an administrative decision is a secondary 
appeal.  Ahn v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 126 Hawaiʻi 1, 
9,
265 P.3d 470, 478 (2011) (citation omitted).  The circuit 
court’s decision is reviewed  de novo.  Id.  The agency ’s 
decision is reviewed under the standards set forth in HRS 
§ 91-14(g).  Id.
  HRS § 91–14(g) (1993) provides:   
 
 (g) Upon review of the record the court may 
affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case
with instructions for further  proceedings; or it may
reverse or modify the decision and order if the 
substantial rights of the petitioners may have been 
prejudiced because the administrative findings, 
conclusions, decisions, or orders are:   
 
 
(1)  In violation of constitutional or
statutory provisions; or   
(2)  In excess of the statutory authority or
jurisdiction of the agency; or   
(3)  Made upon unlawful procedure; or  
(4) Affected by other error of law; or  
(5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,
probative, and substantial evidence on 
the whole record; or   
(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, or  
characterized by abuse of discretion or
clearly unwarranted exercise of 
discretion.  
 
Under HRS § 91 -14(g), conclusions of law are reviewable 
under subsections (1), (2), and (4); questions regarding 
procedural defects under subsection (3); findings of fact 
under subsection (5); and an agency's exercise of 
discretion under subsection (6).   Sierra Club v. Office of
Planning, 109 Hawaiʻ i 411, 414, 126 P.3d 1098, 1101 (2006) 
(citation, internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).

***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
13 B. Interpretation of Agency Rules  
General principles of statutory construction apply in
interpreting administrative rules.  As in statutory 
construction, courts look first at an administrative rule ’s
language.  If an administrative rule ’s language is 
unambiguous, and its literal application is neither 
inconsistent with the policies of the statute the rule 
implements nor produces an absurd or unjust result, courts 
enforce the rule ’s plain meaning.  While an agency’ s 
interpretation of its own rules is generally entitled to 
deference, this court does not defer to agency 
interpretations that are plainly erroneous or inconsistent 
with the underlying legislative purpose.   
 
 
Id. at 103, 306 P.3d at 148 (internal quotation marks and
citations omitted).   
III.  DISCUSSION  
Watanabe argues that the ERS Board misinterpreted the 
standard for exceptions under HAR § 6- 23-19 and erroneously 
concluded that Petitioner’s Proposed Decision did not constitute
exceptions.  Watanabe also contends that the ICA erred by 
affirming the ERS’s misinterpretation of HAR §  6-23-19 and 
holding that Watanabe failed to timely appeal the ERS Board’s 
Proposed Decision.  According to Watanabe, the ERS Board’s and 
ICA’s interpretation of HAR  § 6-23-19 imposes a higher standard 
on petitioners seeking to begin the appeal process and amounts 
to a denial of due process.   
ERS contends that Petitioner’s Proposed Decision  does
not meet the requirements of HAR § 6- 23-19 because, inter alia,
it “merely propose [s] ‘changes’”  to ERS’s Proposed Decision  and 
 
  
 
 
 
 
***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
14 does not clearly express that it sets forth Watanabe’s 
exceptions.  Similarly, the ICA concluded that Petitioner’s 
Proposed Decision did not meet the standard for exceptions 
because “[i]
t did not express that it was an appeal from the 
Proposed Decision; identified no points of error within the 
Proposed Decision; and contained no argument, specification of 
the portion of the record, or authorities to sustain any alleged
point of error in the Proposed Decision. ”  (Footnotes omitted.)  
We agree with Watanabe that Petitioner’s Proposed 
Decision constituted exceptions because it met the general 
requirements for exceptions under the plain language of 
HAR § 6-23-19.  HAR § 6-23-19 does not require that exceptions 
be labeled as exceptions or an appeal, or even contain points of
error or argument.  Furthermore, imposing a higher standard for 
formalities would undermine the purpose of filing exceptions, 
which is to allow a claimant a meaningful opportunity to be 
heard.  
First, the plain language of HAR § 6- 23-19(a) provides
the minimum requirements for the filing of exceptions:  
Within fifteen days after receipt of a copy of the 
board’s proposed decision, any party may file with 
the board exceptions to any part thereof and request 
review by the board. Each exception shall specify the
portion of the record and  authorities relied on to 
sustain each point.    
 
(Emphasis added.)  Thus, HAR § 6-23- 19(a) requires that   
 
 
 
 
***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
15 exceptions: (1) be filed within fifteen days;  and (2) specify
the portion of the record and authorities relied on to sustain
each point.   7  
 
We hold that Petitioner’s Proposed Decision filing 
satisfies the standard for exceptions set forth in 
HAR § 6- 23-19(a).  In Petitioner’s Proposed Decision , Watanabe 
struck through the portion of the ERS Board’s Proposed Decision 
that he disagreed with and inserted underscored language to 
indicate his amendments and additions.  Several of  the 
underscored amendments in Petitioner’s Proposed Decision 
specified the authorities relied on, which were exhibits in the 
administrative record.  Petitioner’s Proposed Decision disputed 
numerous factual findings, an ERS Board member’s testimony 
regarding the definition of “accident” for disability retirement
purposes, and the conclusions of law that Watanabe’s  permanent 
disability was not service- connected.  In sum, Petitioner’s 
Proposed Decision specified Watanabe’s  points of exception by 
either striking through or amending and/or inserting underscored
text and citing the pertinent exhibits in the record.  
Consequently, Petitioner’s Proposed Decision meets the minimum  
 
                                                 
7 ERS does not dispute that Petitioner’s Proposed Decision was filed 
within fifteen days of receipt.  Arguably, ERS  might presume that filings by 
claimants within fifteen days after a proposed decision are likely exceptions,
particularly when the filing proposes “changes” to the proposed decision .     
 
 
 
 
***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
16 requirements for exceptions outlined in HAR § 6- 23-19(a).  
Second, the purpose of filing exceptions is to ensure 
that a claimant has a meaningful opportunity to be heard, not to
impose a procedural barrier.  
 The Administrative Procedure Act is a remedial
statute designed to give citizens a fair opportunity
to be heard before the official of the agency who is
charged with passing on [his] case.    
 
 
 
Agsalud, 65 Haw. at 259, 650 P.2d at 576.  The ERS Board’s 
conclusion that Petitioner’s Proposed Decision did not 
constitute exceptions under HAR § 6
-23-19 effectively creates a 
heightened pleading requirement that is neither present in the 
administrative rule, nor supported by the rule’s authorizing 
statute.  See Hawai ʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) § 91-11 (2012 ).  As
this court has previously stated, agency proceedings are by 8 
                                                 
8 HRS § 91-11 (2012) is the authorizing statute for HAR § 6-23-19.  HRS 
§ 91-11 states: 
 
Examination of evidence by agency.  Whenever in 
a contested case the officials of the agency who are 
to render the final decision have not heard and 
examined all of the evidence, the decision, if 
adverse to a party to the proceeding other than the 
agency itself, shall not be made until a proposal for 
decision containing a statement of reasons and 
including determination of each issue of fact or law 
necessary to the proposed decision has been served 
upon the parties, and an opportunity has been 
afforded to each party adversely affected to file 
exceptions and present argument to the officials  who 
are to render the decision, who shall personally 
consider the whole record or such portions thereof as 
may be cited by the parties.  
 
(Emphasis added.)   
 
 
 
 
***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
17 their nature “simple and non -technical hearings” in which 
“informal proceedings supersede rigid and formal pleadings and
processes.”  Cariaga v. Del Monte Corp., 65 Haw. 404, 409, 652
P.2d 1143, 1147 (1982) (internal citation omitted).  The ERS 
Board’s refusal to consider Watanabe’s filing as exceptions 
because it was not labeled as such ignores the purpose of the 
APA, which is “to give citizens a fair opportunity to be heard
before the official of the agency ” who is deciding his case.  
See Agsalud, 65 Haw. at 259, 650 P.2d at 576.    
 
 
Third, this court has previously rejected an agency’s 
refusal to consider exceptions based on the agency’s rigid 
interpretation of its own rule.  Agsalud, 65 Haw. at 258, 650 
P.2d at 575.  In Agsalud, the appellant filed general exceptions 
within fifteen days after receipt of the agency’s recommended 
decision because he was unable to have the record transcribed 
with the fifteen-day period.  Id.  The hearing officer refused 
to 
consider the appellant’s timely exceptions “because they [did]
not conform to [the rule]” and approved the agency’s preliminary 
decision as final.  Id. at 258, 650 P.2d at 575.  This court 
held that the agency’s refusal to consider the appellant’s 
exceptions violated the APA.  Id. at 259, 650 P.2d at 576.  
“Appellant, having timely file d exceptions, was entitled to the 
opportunity to present argument in written or oral form in   
 
 
 
 
***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
18 support of its exceptions and to have those exceptions
considered on their merits based on the record.”  Id.  
  
Thus, the plain language of HAR § 6- 23-19, the purpose
behind the APA, and this court’s prior precedent all support our
conclusion that Petitioner’s Proposed Decision constituted 
exceptions and that the ERS Board was required to consider 
Watanabe’s exceptions before rendering its final decision.  
Because the ERS Board’s Final Decision erroneously determined 
that 
Petitioner’s Proposed Decision  did not conform to the rule,
the ERS Board refused to consider the merits of Watanabe’s 
exceptions.  Consequently, the ERS Board has not complied with 
HRS § 91-11  because it has not considered Watanabe’s exceptions
and afforded him an opportunity to present argument on his 
exceptions. 9 
 
 
 
Here, the ICA erred by  affirming the Circuit Court’s 
Decision and Final Judgment affirming the ERS Board’s denial of 
Watanabe’s application.  Accordingly, we remand to the ERS Board
for a hearing on the merits of Watanabe’s exceptions.    
IV.  CONCLUSION  
We hold that Watanabe’s Petitioner’s Proposed Decision
