OPINION OF THE COURT BY Mc KENNA, J.   
 
I.  Introduction 
 On April 20, 2016, Vicente Domut (“Domut”) was convicted at 
a bench trial in the District Court of the Second Circuit 
Wailuku Division (“district court”)  of Driving Without a License 
in violation of Hawai ʻi Revised St
atutes (“HRS”)  § 286-102(a) Electronically Filed

 (Supp. 2015) and of No Motor Vehicle Insurance in violation of 
HRS § 431:10C-104(a) (2005) and HRS § 431:10C-117(a)(2),(3),(5)
(Supp. 2006).  Despite requesting a continuance for sentencing,
Domut was immediately sentenced to (1) a jail term of 180 days 
for Driving Without a License as a repeat offender
; (2) a fine 
of $1,500 and $37 in fees for No Motor Vehicle Insurance; and 
(3) suspension of any driver’s license for one year .  Domut 
appealed the district court’s April 20, 2016 judgment to the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals (“ICA”) , which in a summary 
disposition order, State v. Domut, CAAP-16- 0000402, at 1 (App. 
July 30, 2018) (SDO), affirmed the district court’s judgment .   
 
 
 Domut raises two questions on certiorari.  First, he 
contends the ICA erred because the State of Hawai ‘i (“Sta
te”) 
failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Domut was not in 
constructive possession of a license from Mexico or Canada, 
which would have exempted him from licensing requirements 
pursuant to HRS § 286-105 (2007).  We addressed this issue in 
State v. Castillon, 144 Hawaiʻi 406, 443 P.3d 98 (2019).  We held 
that a defendant bears the initial burden to produce evidence to 
support a Hawaiʻi driver’s license exemption based on possession 
of a valid license from Canada or Mexico.  Domut did not produce 
any evidence of the applicability of the exemption to him.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
3 
 Therefore, his first question on certiorari is without merit and 
we do not further address this issue. 
 In his second question on certiorari, Domut contends the 
ICA erred in concluding that he failed to meet his burden of 
production to raise evidence of a “good faith lack of knowledge ” 
defense under HRS § 431:10C-117(a)(4)(C),1 and that the burden 
had shifted to the State to disprove the defense beyond a 
reasonable doubt, citing to State v. Bolosan, 78 Hawaiʻ i 86, 890 
P.2d 673 (1995).  In that case, we held that “if a driver 
borrows an uninsured vehicle, the State must prove beyond a 
reasonable doubt that the driver actually knew that the vehicle 
was uninsured at the time [the driver] was operating it.”  
Bolosan, 78 Hawaiʻ i at 90-91, 890 P.2d at 677-78.    
Domut contends that evidence adduced by the State that he 
was transporting two passengers in the vehicle, that he was not 
on that date and never was the registered owner of the vehicle, 
                     
1  HRS § 431:10C- 117(a)(4)(C) provides:  
(4)  Any person cited under this section shall have an 
opportunity to present a good faith defense, including but 
not limited to lack of knowledge or proof of 
insurance.   The general penalty provision of this section 
shall not apply to:  
            
 . . . . 
 
(C)   Any operator of a borrowed motor vehicle if the 
operator holds a reasonable belief that  the subject 
vehicle is insured . . . .  
 
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
4 and that the vehicle’s registration was cu rrent provided 
evidence 
of the “good faith lack of knowledge defense ,” shifting 
the burden to the State to disprove the defense beyond a 
reasonable doubt.  
As indicated by the ICA, we held in State v. Lee , 90 Hawai ʻi
130, 976 P.2d 444 (1999), that the defendant b ears the burden of
production that they  had borrowed a vehicle owned by another. 
Lee, 90 Hawaiʻ i at 140, 976 P.2d at 454.  Although e vidence of 
facts establishing a defense may also be supplied by the 
prosecution, State v. Locquiao, 100 Hawai ʻi 195, 206, 58 P.3d 
1242, 1253 (2002), Domut did not meet his burden of producing 
evidence that he had borrowed a vehicle owned by another.  
Therefore, we reject his argument.  2 
 
But in his second question on certiorari, Domut  also 
alleges the ICA erred by requiring him to present evidence of a 
“borrower/lender relationship” with the registered owner of the 
vehicle to assert the “good faith lack of knowledge”  defense.  
In this regard, we agree that the ICA erred.  HRS § 431:10C-
117(a)(4)(C) allows the “good faith lack of knowledge”  defense 
when an operator reasonably believes a “borrowed motor vehicle” 
is insured.  An operator could have such a belief without 
2“They, them, and their” are used  as singular pronouns when (1) the 
gender identity of the  person referred to is unknown  or immaterial; or (2)
those are the pronouns of a specific person .  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
5 
 “borrowing” the motor vehicle from the registered owner.  This 
error does not, however, require v acating Domut’s No Motor 
Vehicle Insurance conviction, as there was 
no evidence of 
“borrowing” that would have shifted the burden to the State to 
disprove the defense.  
 We notice plain error affecting substantial rights, 
however, that requires vacating Domut’s convictions for Driving 
Without a License 
and No Motor Vehicle Insurance.  Domut was 
entitled to a jury trial on the Driving Without a License 
charge.  During the jury trial waiver colloquy, the district 
court advised Domut that he had a right to jury trial on only 
one of the charges, and it did not inform him that  he was 
entitled to a jury trial on the Driving Without a License 
charge.  For this reason alone, there was no valid waiver of his 
right to jury trial on this charge.  The district court ’s 
advisement during the jury trial colloquy was also erroneous and 
confusing for other reasons.  Thus, the record does not reflect 
a knowing and intelligent waiver of Domut’ s right to a jury 
trial.  State v. Gomez-Lobato, 130 
Hawaiʻi 465, 469, 312 P.3d 
897, 901 (2013). 
 Accordingly, the district court’s judgment as well as th e 
ICA’s judgment on appeal are  vacated and the case is remanded to ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 the district court for further proceedings consistent with this 
opinion.    
II.  Background 
A.  Factual background and district court proceedings 
 On November 17,  2014, Domut was driving a motor vehicle 
carrying two passengers on Haleakalā 
Highway.  Domut was stopped
by Maui County Police Officer Lawrence Becraft (“Officer 
Becraft”) for speeding and not using a turn signal.   When asked 
by Officer  Becraft, Domut did not produce a driver’s license, 
proof of motor vehicle insurance, or proof of self
-insurance.  
Officer Becraft issued Domut two citations , including the 
citation 2DTC- 14-004621, one for the subject Driving Without a 
License and No Motor Vehicle Insurance
 charges.   The State 
charged Domut for those offenses in  an amended complaint:  3 
COUNT ONE: 
 
That on or about the 17th day of November, 2014, in the 
Division of Wailuku, County of Maui, State of Hawaii, 
VICENTE DOMUT having been convicted of Driving Without a 
License (H.R.S. Section 286- 102), two or more time s within 
a five-year period of the instant offense, did 
intentionally, knowingly or recklessly operate a motor 
vehicle of a category listed in Section 286 -102 of the 
Hawaii Revised Statutes without first being appropriately 
examined and duly licensed as a qualified driver of said 
category of motor vehicles, thereby committing the offense 
of Driving Without a License  in violation of Sections 286 -
102 and 286 -136(b) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.  
                     
3 Citation 2DTC- 14-004621 was issued for the two subject traffic crimes, 
while citation 2DTI- 14-018886 was issued for two non -criminal traffic 
infractions:  exceeding the speed limit by 22  miles per hour in violation of 
HRS § 291C- 102(a)(1) (2007) and driving without a license on the person in 
violation of HRS § 286 -116(a) (2007).   
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

COUNT TWO: 
 
That on or about the 17th day of November, 2014, in the 
Division of Wailuku, County of Maui, State of Hawaii, 
VICENTE DOMUT having previously committed the offense of no 
Motor Vehicle Insurance (H.R.S. Section 431:10C -104) two or  
more times within a five -year period of the instant 
offense, did intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly 
operate or use a motor vehicle bearing license plate number 
LAH091, upon any public street, road, or highway of this 
State without said motor vehicle being insured under a 
motor vehicle insurance policy, thereby committing the 
offense of No Motor Vehicle Insurance in violation of 
Sections 431:10C -104(a) and 431:10C -117(a)(2), (3), (5) of 
the Hawaii Revised Statutes.  
  
 On November 5, 2015, Domut appeared before the district 
court.4  The following colloquy took place:   
COUNSEL:  [Deputy Public Defender]  for . . . with Mr. Domu t
 
in receipt of complaint ending 1298, failure to appear.  
The other ending 4621, Driving Without a License, no motor 
vehicle insurance.  Waiving reading both matters.  Um . . . 
I note that he does have a jury trial right.  One second 
. . . .  He would waive jury trial right.  
COURT:  Okay, your name, sir.  
DEFENDANT:  Vicente Domut.  
COURT:  Okay, Mr. Domut.  Um, on some, on one of the 
charges you have a right to a trial by a jury.  A trial by 
a jury is one in which a jury is picked by  you, your 
attorney, and the prosecutor.  Twelve people from the 
community are picked to be the jurors.  The jury . . . ah  
. . . all twelve members must find you guilty unanimously 
in order to convict you of a crime.   
DEFENDANT:  Yes, sir.  
COURT:  If all  twelve do not find you guilty, then you’re 
not guilty of that particular crime.  Um . . . if you 
waive, that is, give up your right to a trial by a jury, 
and it will be a district  court judge and a judge by him  – 
or herself will have uh will preside over a trial if we 
have a trial.  Uh . . . it’s my understanding from your 
attorney that you want to waive your right to a trial by a 
jury.  Is that what you want to do?  
                     
4  The Honorable Douglas J. Sameshima presided.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
8 
 DEFENDANT:  Yes, sir.   
COURT:  You understand your right to a trial by jury?  
DEFENDANT:  Yes, sir.   
COURT:  And you still want to waive it.  
DEFENDANT:  Yes.  
COURT:  This is your decision?  
DEFENDANT:  Yes, sir.  
COURT:  And you’re entering your waiver uh of your own free 
will?  
DEFENDANT:  Yes, sir.  
COURT:  Based on my questions, I  find that the defendant 
has knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived his 
right to a trial by a jury.  I’ll accept the not guilty 
plea entered by your attorney.  
The district court then entered an order indicating Domut had 
waived his right to a jury trial and had pled not guilty.   
On April 20, 2016, the district court5 conducted  a bench 
trial.  
The State first presented Officer Becraft as a witness.  In 
summary, Officer Becraft testified as follows.  On November 17, 
2014, he stopped Domut on the Haleakal ā Highway, a public 
roadway, for speeding and not using a turn signal.  Domut was in 
the driver’s seat and two p assengers were in the vehicle. 
Officer Becraft asked Domut for his driver’s license and  vehicle 
                     
5 The Honorable Blaine Kobayashi presided over the trial and sentencing.  
The trial was for two district court cases consolidated by agreement for 
purposes of trial:  (1) 2DTC -14 -004621, prosecution for driving without a 
license and driving without motor vehicle insurance; and (2) 2DTA -15 -01298, 
prosecution for failure to appear in court in violation of HRS § 803 -6(e) 
(2014).  Domut’s failure to appear conviction was not appealed to the ICA and 
is not a part of this certiorari proceeding.   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 registration.  Domut gave him a Hawai ʻi State I.D. and “nothing 
else was current except the registration may have been current.”  
Domut stated “he didn’t have a license on him.”  When Officer 
Becraft asked Domut for his insurance card, Domut did not 
produce the card, did not provide any proof that he was self-
insured, and did not explain why he did not have insurance.  
Officer Becraft then issued Domut two citations, including a 
citation for Driving Without a License and No Motor Vehicle 
Insurance.  
 Juvylyn Garalde (“Garalde”), a customer service 
representative from the Departmen t of Motor Vehicles (“DMV”), 
testified next for the State.  Garalde interpreted a database 
printout of the title and registration form for the vehicle 
Domut was driving on November 17, 2014, which ind icated that 
Jose Vasquez-Polito obtained title to that vehicle on October 
28, 2013 from Felicity Rogust and that there had been  no 
subsequent transfers of title to the vehicle.6   
 Domut did not 
present any evidence.   
                     
6  The State also moved into the record (1) “a notice of entry of judgment 
from case ending in 1926 relating to a Vicente [Domut] ending in 11948 
reflecting a driver’s license conviction from 8/27/13;” (2) a notice of entry 
of judgment from a “ case ending in 7292 for a Vicente Domut party I.D. 119548 
reflecting a driving without a license conviction 3/22/2012;” and (3) “a 
notice of entry of judgment for a case ending in 5534 for a Vicente 
Domut 
party I.D. 119548 reflecting a driving without license conviction on 
12/13/2011.” 
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
10 
 During closing argument, with respect to the No Motor 
Vehicle Insurance charge, Domut  contended the “good faith lack 
of knowledge” defense applied because the evidence demonstrated 
he did not own the car he was driving when cited.  Domut argued 
the State failed to disprove the defense because it did not 
present evidence demonstrating he knew the car was uninsured or 
that he should have been on notice to ask whether the car was 
insured before driving it.   
The district court rejected Domut’s arguments and adjudged  
Domut guilty on all counts and immediately proceeded to 
sentencing. 
 The State indicated it was seeking a one -year term 
of imprisonment for the Driving Without a License conviction, a 
fine of $1,500 for the No Motor Vehicle Insurance conviction, 
and a one-year suspension of any driver’s license.  
Domut’s counsel  requested a con tinuance of sentencing, 
stating, 
You know, at this time, I do not believe that – I believe 
that this is going to be something set for an appeal, and 
you know, I’m not prepared – I can argue  sentencing.  As 
far as this goes, I would ask to continue sentencing until 
I can – there can be something resolved because I don’t 
believe that – I don’t believe that this is the correct 
ruling.  And I don’t believe – I would not like to see Mr. 
Domut do jail time for something that he should not be 
doing jail time for.  As far as sentencing goes, if we have 
to proceed today, you know, I understand the prior charges 
before.  
The district court did not acknowledge or respond to the request 
to continue sentencing.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
11 (continued. . .)  
 Domut’s counsel  then argued that a maximum sentence was 
inappropriate because the incident occurred over two years ago, 
and since then, Domut had not been driving.  During his 
allocution, Domut told the district court that he had been 
driving to take his sister-in -law to the doctors for a checkup 
on an infection, that he believed the car was insured, and that 
he had not driven after being cited.   
 The district court stated it did not believe Domut’s  
personal situation provided a justification for continuing to 
violate the law and imposed a jail term of 180 days for Driving 
Without a License, 
a fine of $1,500 and $37 in fees for No Motor
Vehicle Insurance, and a suspension of any driver’s license for 
one year.   The district court filed a judgment , which reflected
its granting of Domut’s attorney’s oral motion to stay the  
sentence pending appeal
.   87 
 
                     
7 Domut was also sentenced to a 30 -day jail term for the failure to 
appear in court conviction.   
 
8  Despite the judgment staying the sentence, after the ICA’s July 30, 
2018 SDO, on August 28, 2018, one day before the ICA’s August 29, 2018 
Judgment on Appeal, a different district court judge issued a mittimus 
executing Domut’s prison sentence, and Domut was temporarily taken into 
custody.  The record does not reflect what representations were made to the 
judge before the mittimus was issued, but a “stipulation and order for 
release” was signed the same day and filed the next day; the record does not 
reflect when Domut was released.  Execution of sentence was then continued 
several times.  On May 28, 2019, the State objected to the defense’s oral 
motion to continue execution of sentence, and the execution of sentence date 
was continued to June 4, 2019.  The record again does not reflect what 
representations were made to the district court, but the district court again 
issued a mittimus to execute the stayed sentence on that date.  But later 
that day, the State submitted an ex parte motion to recall mittimus, which ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
12 
 B.  ICA Proceedings 
 Domut timely appealed the district court judgment to the 
ICA asserting that:  (1) his Driving Without a License 
conviction should be reversed because the State failed to prove 
Domut did not fall into one or more of the enumerated exemptions 
from HRS § 286-105
;9 and (2) that his No Motor Vehicle Insurance 
conviction should be reversed because the State failed to negate 
Domut’s “
good faith lack of knowledge”  defense .    
 With respect to the No Motor Vehicle Insurance conviction, 
Domut argued that the following evidence at trial indicated that 
Domut borrowed the vehicle and thus raised the “good faith lack 
                                                                  
(. . .continued)  
was approved, as well as another “stipulation and order” for rele ase, which 
was also approved.  Both documents indicate that Domut had again been taken 
into custody on June 4, 2019; the record is unclear when he was released.   
 
Defendants convicted of misdemeanors, petty misdemeanors, or law 
violations are entitled to bail and a stay of sentence pending appeal .  State 
v. Kiese, 126 Hawaiʻ i 494, 510, 273 P.3d 1180, 1196 (2012).  Hence, the 
sentencing judge appropriately ordered a stay pending appeal.  But according 
to the record, although it appears he was quickly released each time, Domut 
was twice taken into custody while his appeal remained pending.  The district 
court issued the first mittimus after the ICA’s SDO, on the day before the 
judgment on appeal.  But even if the ICA judgment on appeal had been filed a 
few days before the first mittimus, under Hawai ʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure 
(“HRAP”) Rule 36(c)(1) (2016) and HRS § 602 -59(c)(2016 & Supp. 2017), it 
would not have been effective until 30 days after its filing at the very 
earliest.  Prosecuting attorneys, defense counsel, and trial courts should 
all ensure that there is an effective judgment on appeal under HRAP Rule 36 
that would allow for execution of stayed sentences before attempting to 
execute a sentence.   
 
9  As indicated earlier, this issue was resolve d against Domut’s argument 
in Castillon, 144 Hawai ʻi 406, 443 P.3d 98, in which we held that a defendant 
bears the initial burden to produce “some evidence” to support a Hawai ʻi 
driver’s license exemption based on possession of a valid license from Canada 
or Mexico, which Domut did not do.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
13 
 of knowledge” defense under HRS § 431:10C-117(a)(4)(C): (1) 
Domut was transporting two passengers in the vehicle;  (2) Domut 
was not on that date and never was the registered owner of the 
vehicle; and (3) the vehicle’s registration was current.  Citing 
Bolosan, Domut asserted that once evidence was adduced that the 
vehicle was borrowed, the State was required to prove beyond a 
reasonable doubt that Domut actually knew the vehicle was 
uninsured at the time he was operating it.  The State failed to 
do so, Domut argued.  
 Domut contended that the following evidence also  
demonstrated that Domut had a reasonable belief the car was 
insured:  (1) Domut readily provided Officer Becraft with the 
registration information; (2) the safety check, which required 
up-to-date insurance, apparently was not expired because Officer 
Becraft did not cite Domut for an expired safety check; and (3) 
Domut never indicated to Officer Becraft an awareness that the 
car was uninsured.  
 Citing Lee, 90 Hawai ʻi 130, 976 P.2d 444
, the State 
responded that Domut bore the burden of production regarding the
“good faith lack of knowledge” defense and failed to do so.  The
State contended  that because Domut did not testify, there was no
evidence he had  borrowed the vehicle.  The State maintained that
the district court therefore properly 
inferred that  Domut  
 
 
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
14 
 intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly drove the vehicle 
without insurance.   
 The ICA filed a summary disposition order on July 30, 2018  
affirming the district court’s judgment.  Domut, SDO at 1.  
Citing Lee and State v. Kahaunaele, 10 Haw. App. 519, 879 P.2d 
566 (1994), the ICA held that Domut was required to present some 
evidence raising the “good faith lack of knowledge”  defense 
before the burden shifted to the State.  Domut, SDO at 4.  
According to the ICA, the evidence did not indicate any 
“borrower/lender relationship” between Domut and the registered 
owner of the vehicle sufficient to infer that Domut was a 
borrower entitled to the good faith borrower defense.  Domut, 
SDO at 5.  The ICA therefore affirmed the district court.   
III.  Standard of Review 
A. Statutory Interpretation  
 “The interpretation of a statute is a question of law 
reviewable de novo.”  Ka Pa ʻakai O Ka ʻĀina
 v. Land Use Comm’n ,
94 Hawaiʻ i 31, 41, 7 P.3d 1068, 1078 (2000) (citation omitted). 
     
When construing a statute, our foremost obligation is to 
ascertain and give effect to the intention of the 
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the 
language contained in the statute itself.  And we must read 
statutory language in the context of the entire statute and 
construe it in a manner consistent with its purpose.   
 
Id.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
15 B. Plain Error
Hawai‘i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 52(b) states 
that “[p]lain errors or defects affec ting substantial 
rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the
attention of the court.”  Therefore, an appellate court 
“may recognize plain error when the error committed affects
substantial rights of the defendant.”   State v. Staley , 91 
Hawai‘i 275, 282, 982 P.2d 904, 911 (1999) (citation 
omitted).
  
 
The appellate court “will apply the plain error standard of
review to correct errors which seriously affect the 
fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial 
proceedings, to serve the ends  of justice, and to prevent 
the denial of fundamental rights.”   State v. Nichols,  111 
Hawai‘i 327, 334, 141 P.3d 974, 981 (2006) (quoting  State v.
Sawyer, 88 Hawai ‘i 325, 330, 966 P.2d 637, 642 (1998)).  An 
appellate court’ s “power to deal with plain error  is one to
be exercised sparingly and with caution because the plain 
error rule represents a departure from a presupposition of 
the adversary system  — that a party must look to [their]  
counsel for protection and bear the cost of counsel’ s 
mistakes.”  
 Nichols,  111 Hawai‘ i at 335,  141 P.3d at 982

C.Waiver of Jury Trial
The validity of a defendant ’s waiver  of the right to a jury
trial in a criminal case presents a question of state and 
federal constitutional law.  We answer questions of 
constitutional law by exercising our own independent 
constitutional judgment based on the facts of the case.  Thus, 
we review questions of constitutional law under the right/wrong 
standard.  State v. Friedman, 93 Hawai ʻi 63, 67, 996 P.2d 268, 
272 (2000) (citations and quotation marks omitted).

16 (continued. . .)  A waiver is the knowing, intelligent, and voluntary 
relinquishment of a known right.  Thus, to determine whether a 
waiver was voluntarily and intelligently undertaken, this court 
will look to the totality of facts and circumstances of each 
particular case.  Friedman, 93 Hawaiʻ i at 68, 996 P.2d at 273.  
IV. Discussion
A. There was no evidence that Domut borrowed the vehicle;
therefore, the burden of disproving the “good faith lack of
knowledge” defense was never shifted to the State.
Regarding the No Motor Vehicle Insurance conviction, Domut
contends there was sufficient evidence of the “good faith lack 
of knowledge” defense to shift the burden of disproving the 
defense to the State.  T he “good faith lack of knowledge”  
defense under HRS § 431:10C -117(a)(4)(C ) and Lee, 90 Hawaiʻi  at 
139, 976 P.2d at 453, is not an affirmative defense under 
HRS § 701-115(3) 
(2014).  Bolosan, 78 Hawai ʻi at 89, 890 P.2d at
676 (1995).  Accordingly, it is a non- affirmative defense under 
HRS § 701- 115(2)(a),  which the State has the burden of1110 
10HRS § 701- 115(3) provides:  
(3) A defense is an affirmative defense if:
(a)It is specifically so designated by the Code or
another statute; or
(b)If the Code or another statute plainly requires
the defendant to prove the defense by a preponderance
of the evidence.
11HRS § 701- 115(2)(a) provides:   “If the defense is not an affirmative 
defense, the defendant is entitled to an acquittal if the trier of fact finds ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
17 disproving beyond a reasonable doubt.  Locquiao , 100 Hawai ʻi at 
202, 58 P.3d at 1249.  
Whether a defense is an affirmative or non- affirmative 
defense, as set out in HRS § 701-115(2), “[n]o defense may be 
considered by the trier of fact unless evidence of the specified
fact or facts has been presented.”  As explained in the 
Commentary to HRS § 701- 115:  “The Code establishes two classes 
of defenses.  As to both, it places an initial burden on the 
defendant to come forward with some credible evidence of facts 
constituting the defense, unless, of course, those facts are 
supplied by the prosecution ’s witnesses. ”  As indicated in this 
commentary, although the defendant has the initial burden to 
come forward with some credible evidence of facts constituting 
the defense, facts establishing a defense may also be supplied 
by the prosecution.  Locquiao , 100 Hawai ʻi at 206, 58 P.3d at 
1253.  
The “good faith lack of knowledge” defense to the offense  
of No Motor Vehicle Insurance is set forth in HRS § 431:10C-
117(a)(4)(C): 
(4)Any person cited under this section shall have an
opportunity to present a good faith defense, including but
not limited to lack of knowledge or proof of insurance.
(. . .continued)  
that the evidence, when considered in the light of any contrary prosecution 
evidence, raises a reasonable doubt as to the defendant ’s guilt . . . .” ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
18 The general penalty provision of this section shall not
apply to:  
. . . . 
(C) Any operator of a borrowed motor vehicle  if the
operator holds a reasonable belief that the subject vehicle
is insured  . . . . 
Pursuant to the statute, the facts constituting the “good faith
lack of knowledge” defense are that (1) the defendant was the 
operator of the subject motor vehicle; (2)  the defendant 
“borrowed” the subject vehicle; and (3)  the defendant held a 
reasonable belief that the subject vehicle was insured.   
In this case, there is no dispute regarding (1), that Domut
was the operator of the subject motor vehicle.  With respect to 
(3), in Bolosan , we reaffirmed the following holding of the ICA 
in Kahaunaele:  
[T]he borrower of a motor vehicle has a statutory right t o
reasonably believe that the borrowed motor vehicle is
insured.  Evidence that the defendant borrowed and operated
upon a public street a motor vehicle that was not insured
under a no -fault policy is sufficient evidence to sustain
[the lack of knowledge d efense].  The fact that the
borrower did not consider whether or not the borrowed motor
vehicle was insured does not negative [the] defense.
However, if one or more relevant facts reasonably required
the borrower to inquire, [they] then had a duty to inqui re
until [they]  reasonably believed that the motor vehicle was
insured.  The borrower’ s failure to satisfy that duty to
inquire negatives [the] defense[ ].
Bolosan, 78 Hawaiʻ i
 at 91 n.9, 890 P.2d at 678 n.9 (quoting 
Kahaunaele , 10 Haw. App. at 531, 879 P.2d at 571 ).  In Domu t’s 
case, there is no evidence of the existence of facts reasonably
requiring Domut to inquire as to whether or not the subject 
Therefore, pursuant to Bolosan
, motor vehicle was insured.   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
19 Domut had a statutory right to reasonably believe that the
subject vehicle was insured, but only if the vehicle was 
“borrowed.”12 
The issue in this case therefore is whether there is 
evidence of (2), that Domut “borrowed” the subject motor 
vehicle. 
As argued by the State, in Lee, 90 Hawai ʻi 130, 976 P.2d 
444, we noted that the defendant bears
 the burden of production 
that they had borrowed a vehicle owned by another.  90 Hawai ʻi at
140, 976 P.2d at 454 (construing the “ good faith lack of 
knowledge” defense).  Lee is consistent with HRS § 431 :10C-117, 
which provides a defendant with “an opportunity to present a 
good faith defense.”  I n Lee, we rejected the defendant’s 
argument that, where it is unclear whether a driver is the 
registered owner of a vehicle, “the presumption should be that 
[the driver] is not the owner.”   Id.  As there was no evidence 
of ownership of the subject vehicle by another, Lee did not need
to address the issue of whether the defendant had “borrowed” the
subject vehicle.  As in Lee , however, no presumption exists  
 
 
12For this reason, we need not address D omut’s assertions of evidence 
showing that he had a reasonable belief the car was insured  – that (1) Domut 
readily provided Officer Becraft with the registration information; (2) the 
safety check, which required up -to
-date insurance, apparently was not expired
because Officer Becraft did not cite Domut for an expired safety check; and 
(3)Domut never indicated to Officer Becraft an aware ness that the car was
uninsured. ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
20 under the statute that a subject vehicle was “borrowed.”  
Therefore, the defendant bears the burden of producing evidence 
that the subject vehicle was “borrowed” if such evidence was not 
presented in the State’s case.13
Thus, we address whether or not there was evidence that 
Domut had “ borrowed ” the subject vehicle.  In this regard, HRS 
Chapter 431 does not define “borrow,” but “this court ma y resort 
to legal or other well accepted dictionaries as one way to 
determine the ordinary meaning of certain terms not statutorily 
defined.”  State v. Pacquing , 139 Hawai ‘i 302, 312, 389 P.3d 897, 
907 (2016) (citation omitted).  Black’s Law Dictionary  defines 
“borrow” as “
[t]o take something for temporary use. ”  Borrow, 
Black’
s Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014).  The Oxford Dictionary 
defines “borrow” as to “ [t]ake and use (something that belongs 
to someone else) with the intention of returning it.”   A 
“borrowed motor vehicle,” therefore, is a motor vehicle that has 
been taken for temporary use with the intention of returning 
it.  14
13We also note that  Kahaunaele was a consolidated opinion involving seven 
separate defendants and evidence of “borrowing” had been presented by the
defendant or through stipulation.  Kahaunaele, 10 Haw. App. at 521 -22, 879
P.2d at 567- 68.  Thus, for all seven defendants, there was “some evidence” of
the second element of the defense  – that defendant had “borrowed” the subject
vehicle.
14Oxford Dictionaries, https://perma.cc/7VR6 -ZPTV (last visited Jan. 2, 
2020). ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
21 
   Evidence of facts constituting a defense can be those 
supplied by the prosecution.  Domut asserts that the evidence 
adduced by the State that he was transporting two passengers 
and/or that he was never the registered owner of the su bject 
vehicle constitutes sufficient evidence  that he had “borrowed” 
the subject vehicle  to have shifted the burden to the State .  We 
disagree.   
A person can operate a vehicle registered in another 
person’s name, with or without  passengers, without borrowing it
.  
If the fact that a vehicle was registered in someone else’s name 
was sufficient to con stitute evidence that an operator had 
“borrowed” a motor vehicle, then operators  of motor vehicles 
could circumvent the No Motor Vehicle Insurance law by 
transferring title of a vehicle to a third or fictitious person 
without presenting any actual evidence of “borrowing.”   
Thus, 
Domut’s contention on certiorari that there was sufficient 
evidence of “borrowing” to have shifted the burden to the State 
to disprove the “good faith lack of knowledge” defense lacks 
merit.  
 In his second question on certiorari, Domut also alleges 
that the ICA erred in placing a burden on him to present 
evidence of a “borrower/lender relationship” with the registered 
owner of the vehicle to assert the “good faith lack of ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
22 
 knowledge” defense.  In this regard, we agree that the ICA 
erred.   
HRS § 431:10C- 117(a)(4)(C ) allows the “good faith lack of 
knowledge” defense for a “borrowed motor vehicle” that the 
operator reasonably believes is insured.  The ICA stated that 
“there was no evidence presented as to any borrower/lender 
relationship between Domut and the registered own er.”  Domut, 
SDO at 5.  However, this  language from the ICA’s SDO is 
inconsistent with the statute, which does not require that the 
operator have “borrowed” the vehicle from the registered owner.  
An operator could borrow a vehicle from someone other than a 
registered owner and have a reasonable belief it is insured.15  
Hence, the ICA erred by requiring Domut to adduce evidence of a 
“borrower/lender relationship” with the registered owner of the 
vehicle to raise the “good faith lack of knowledge”  defense.  
This error does not, however, require reversal of Domut’s No 
Motor Vehicle Insurance conviction, as there was no evidence of 
the threshold requirement that the subject vehicle was 
“borrowed.”  
 
                     
15  For example, the registered owner could be a prominent member of the 
community who provides a vehicle to a child who is a college student, who 
lends the vehicle to another student for a short drive to the supermarket.  
The other student could have a reasonable belief that the vehicle is insured, 
even if they did not borrow the vehicle from the registered owner.

 B. There was no valid waiver of Domut’s right to jury trial.  
 
Domut was entitled to a jury trial on the Driving Without a 
License charge pursuant to article I, section 14 of the 
Constitution of the State of Hawai ʻi, as he was subject to up to 
one-year imprisonment as indicated in the amended complaint. 
Consistent with constitutional requirements, HRS § 806-60 (2014) 
provides that “[a]ny defendant charged with a serious crime 
shall have the right to trial by a jury of twelve 
members.  ‘Serious crime’ means any crime for which the 
defendant may be imprisoned for six mont hs or more.”16  
 It is well established that Hawai ʻi law recognizes the right 
to a jury trial as a fundamental right that cannot be 
                     
16  As we stated in Gomez- Lobato, 130 Hawaiʻi at 477 n.12, 312 P.3d at 908 
n.12: 
 
Although HRS § 806 –60 provides that a “serious crime” for 
which there is a right to trial by jury means “any crime 
for which the defendant may be imprisoned for six months or 
more[,]” this court has taken into account multiple factors 
when determining if an offense is petty or serious, for 
purposes of the right to trial by jury.   See State v. 
Ford, 84 Hawai ʻi 65, 69– 70, 929 P.2d 78, 82 –83 (1996) .  
Three factors are analyzed to determine whether an offense 
is constitutionally petty or serious: “(1) treatment of the 
offense at common law;  (2) the gravity of the offense; and 
(3) the authorized penalty.”  
 Id. at 70, 929 P.2d at 
82; State v. Sullivan , 97 Hawaiʻ i 259, 264, 36 P.3d 803, 809 
(2001); see also State v. Lindsey , 77 Hawaiʻ i 162, 164, 883 
P.2d 83, 85 (1994)  (noting the presumption that this 
jurisdiction will not recognize the right to a jury trial 
where the maximum term of imprisonment is less than thirty 
days).  Consequently, an offense involving a term of 
imprisonment that is less than six months can still 
constitute constitutionally a “serious” crime for which 
there is a right to trial by jury.  
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 relinquished absent a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary 
waiver.  State v. Torres, 144 Hawaiʻ i 282, 288, 439 P.3d 234,
 240 
(2019).  While a defendant may waive the right to a jury trial, 
the waiver must be made knowingly, intelligently, and 
voluntarily.  Gomez-Lobato, 130 Hawaiʻi at 477, 312 P.3d at  908.   
A waiver is the knowing, intelligent, and voluntary 
relinquishment of a known right.  State v. Baker, 132 Hawaiʻi 1, 
6, 319 P.3d 1009, 1014 (2014).   
Whether a defendant validly waived the right to jury trial 
is reviewed under the  totality of the circumstances surrounding 
a case, taking into account the defendant’s background, 
experience, and conduct.  Gomez -Lobato, 130 Hawai
ʻi at 470, 312 
P.3d at 902.  A waiver is knowing and intelligent when it is 
made with full awareness of both the nature of the right being 
abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon 
it.  Torres, 144 Hawaiʻi at 288, 439 P.3d at 240.  A trial court 
has a “serious and weighty responsibility” with respect to jury 
trial waivers, and has an obligation to ensure, through an 
appropriate colloquy on the record, that the waiver was 
knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily given.  Baker, 132 
Hawaiʻi at 6, 319 P.3d at 1014.
  And although we exercise the 
power sparingly, we have the discretion to sua sponte  notice 
plain error affecting substantial rights even if not raised on ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
25 
 appeal.  State v. Miller, 122 Hawai ʻi 92, 115, 223 
P.3d 157, 180 
(2010) (quoting  State v. Fox, 70 Haw. 46, 56, 760 P.2d 670, 676 
(1988)).   
Reviewing the totality of circums tances regarding Domut’s 
waiver of jury trial, we first note that the district  court’s 
colloquy asked no questions regarding Domut’s background, 
education, or experience.  
The district court told  Domut, “on one of the charges you 
have a right to a trial by a jury[,]” but did not state that 
this right inured to the Driving Without a License charge.   
Domut was told he was entitled to a jury trial on one charge 
only, not both, implying he 
only had the oppo rtunity to have a 
jury trial on one charge , and he was not even informed which 
charge that was.  The district court’s advisement therefore 
suggested that if Domut did not waive his right to a jury trial 
on the one charge to which he was entitled to a jury, whichever 
it was, he would have to undergo two trials, one with a jury and 
one with a judge.  This suggestion was misleading because HRS § 
701-109(2) (2014) provides, “[e]xcept as provided in subsection 
(3) of this section, a defendant shall not be subject to 
separate trials for multiple offense . . . arising from the same 
episode . . . .”  The exception in HRS § 701 -109(3) allows for 
separate trials if the court so orders, when “satisfied that ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
26 
 justice so requires.”  No separa te trial was requested, and it 
is unclear whether justice could have required separate trials.   
Therefore, the district court’s advisement was insufficient, 
confusing, and incorrect.17 
The dissent regarding this issue maintains that separate 
trials would not have been necessary because Domut could have 
had a single trial with two different factfinders, with the jury 
adjudicating the charge with a right to jury trial and the judge 
adjudicating the charge without a right to jury trial, and cites 
to cases from other states that have followed  such a process.  
Under Hawai ʻi law and procedure, however, 
Domut would in all 
likelihood have had the opportunity  of having both charges tried 
                     
17  The district court’s failure to inform Domut of the charge to which he 
had a right to jury trial is analogous to our recent opinion in State v. 
Carlton, SCWC- 17-0000419,  2019 WL 6271671 (Nov . 25, 2019).  In Carlton, the 
ICA remanded defendant’s kidnapping, robbery, and assault  convictions, giving 
the State the option of retrial or proceeding directly to sentencing  if it 
dismissed two of the three charges.  Carlton, 2019 WL 6271671, at *2.  It was 
only after the defense had made its sentencing argument and the defendant 
addressed the court that the State disclosed its decision to ask the court to 
sentence the defendant on the robbery charge and to dismiss the kidnapping 
and assault charges , after which the court sentenced the defendant to twenty 
years imprisonment on the robbery charge.  Carlton, 2019 WL 6271671, at *3.  
We noted that each of the potential charges on which the defendant could be 
sentenced were predicated on different conduct and had different elements, 
and that because the defendant did not know the offense he was to be 
sentenced on, he was not afforded a meaningful opportunity to address the 
circumstances of the robbery offense.   Carlton, 2019 WL 6271671, at *8.  
Likewise, in this case, because the district court told Domut he only had a 
right to jury trial on one of the charges, Domut did not know which charge he 
was waiving his right to jury trial for.  But, as we explain, Domut was also 
not informed that he may have had the  opportunity of having a jury trial on 
both charges.     
 
 
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
27 
 by a jury.  If Domut had not waived his right to a jury trial, 
the entire case would have been committed to the circuit court 
pursuant to HRPP Rule 5(b)(3)(2014) , which provides in part, “If 
the defendant does not waive the right to a trial by jury at or 
before the time of entry of a plea of not guilty, the court 
shall commit the defendant to the circuit court for trial by 
jury . . . .”  In addition, HRS § 604-8 (Supp. 2001)  provides 
that “[i]n any case cognizable by a district court . . . in 
which the accused has the right to a trial by jury in the first 
instance, the district court, upon demand by the accused for a 
trial by jury, shall not exercise jurisdiction over the case, 
but shall . . . commit for trial the accused as provided by law 
. . . .”  Thus, if Domut had not waived his right to jury trial, 
Domut’s entire “case” would have been triable by a jury  unless 
otherwise ordered by the circuit court.  
There were additional issues with the district co urt’s jury 
trial advisements.  The district court told Domut that if he 
waived his right to a jury trial, a judge “will preside over a 
trial if we have a trial.”  Even under the process the d issent 
suggests, a judge “presides” ove r both jury and non- jury trials. 
Domut was not informed, however,  of the fundamental distinction 
between bench and jury trials that if he waived his right to 
jury trial, one judge as compared t o twelve jurors would ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
28 (continued. . .)  
 actually decide whether he was guilty or not.18  Finally, the 
district court was also incorrect when it informed Domut that 
“[i]f all twelve do not find you guilty, then you’re not guilty 
of that particular crime.”  A lack of unanimity  as to guilt does 
not result in a defendant being “not guilty.”  
Thus, vi ewed under a totality of the circumstances, the 
record does not reflect a knowing and intelligent waiver of 
Domut’s fundamental right to a jury trial.  We therefore vacate 
Domut’s convictions on the Driving Without a License and No 
Motor Vehicle Insurance charges and
 remand the case to the 
district court for further proceedings consistent with this 
opinion.19  
                     
18  Gomez-Lobato referred to the following advisement regarding this point 
from Friedman:  “So by waiving that right means that your case will be 
decided by a judge, the judge alone is to decide yo ur guilt or innocence.”  
Gomez-Lobato, 130 Hawai ʻi at 470, 312 P.3d at 902  (quoting Friedman, 93 
Hawaiʻi at 66, 996 P.2d at 271 ).  
 
19  Domut’s original sentence is no longer at issue, but we note that  after 
the State stated its position on sentencing, incl uding requesting one year 
imprisonment on the Driving Without a License conviction , Domut’s counsel 
requested a continuance of the  sentencing.   The district court did not 
acknowledge the request and proceeded to sentencing .  HRPP Rule 32(a)  (2012) 
provides that “[b]efore . . . imposing sentence, the court shall address the 
defendant personally and afford a fair opportunity to the defendant and 
defendant’ s counsel, if any, to make a statement and present any information 
in mitigation of punishment .”  HRPP Rule 32(a)  (emphasis added).   
 
 A pre-sentence investigation and report (“PSI”) is discretionary for 
defendants older than 21 who are convicted of misdemeanor offenses.   
HRS § 706- 601(1)&(2)(2014).  In appropriate cases, trial courts should 
exercise their discretion to order PSIs for misdemeanor convictions so that 
they can appropriately consider HRS § 706 -606 (2014) sentencing factors.  See 
State v. Harter, 134 Hawai ʻi 308, 332 n.29, 340 P.3d 440, 464 n.29 (2014) 
(“Had the court requested a pre- sentence report, the court would have

V. Conclusion
Based on the reasons stated above, w e vacate the ICA’s 
August 29, 2018 judgment on appeal and the district court’s 
judgment.  Although we believe the district court could be fair, 
under the circumstances, we conclude the appearance of justice 
would be better served if this case was remanded to a different 
judge than the sentencing judge .

also had the discretion to grant defense counsel’s request for a continuance 
for sentencing, so that Domut could “present any information in mitigation of 
punishment.”  A court’s failure to exercise discretion can constitute an 
abuse of discretion.  Hamilton v. Hamilton, 138 Hawai ʻi 185, 197, 378 P.3d
