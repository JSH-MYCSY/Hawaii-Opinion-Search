OPINION OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J. 
I. Introduction
This case arises out of the Circuit Court of the First 
Circuit’s (“circuit court”)  dismissal of criminal charges based
on the statute of limitations.  Section 701-108(3)(a) of the 
Hawaiʻi Revised S
tatutes (“HRS”) enables prosecution to be 
commenced “ within three years after discovery of the offense by 
an aggrieved party or by a person who has a legal duty to 
represent an aggrieved party and who is oneself not a party to 1

 the offense,” despite the expiration of the statute of 
limitations if the charged offense contains an element of 
“fraud, deception . . . or a breach of fiduciary 
obligation[.] ” 2
 The circuit court dismissed all six counts of theft filed 
by the State of Hawai ʻi
 (“State”) against Laura Pitolo (“Pitolo”) 
on the grounds that the March 17, 2015 felony i nformation was 
filed after any extension of the three-year statute of 
limitations based on HRS § 701-108(3)(a) had expired.  After the 
State appealed, in a 
published opinion, the Intermediate C ourt 
of Appeals (“ICA”)  reinstate d Counts 4, 5, and 6.  State v. 
Pitolo, 141 Hawaiʻ i 131, 406 P.3d 354 (App. 2017).  Pitolo seeks 
certiorari review of the ICA’s reinstatement of those counts . 
 We hold that  the ICA did not err by re instating  Counts 4 
through 6 because there are questions of fact regarding the 
statute of limitations applicable to those counts that must be 
determined by the factfinder, the jury, and the circuit court 
therefore erred by dismissing these charges.  As factual issues 
exist, however, the ICA erred by ruling that the earliest date 
of the “discovery of [Counts 4 through 6] by an aggrieved party 
or by a person who has a legal duty to represent an aggrieved 
party and who is one self not a party to the offense” under HRS § 
                     
2 In no event, however, does HRS § 701 -108(3)(a) extend the statute of 
limitations by more than six years after the expiration of the statute of 
limitations prescribed in HRS § 701-108(2).  HRS § 701- 108(3)(a) (2014).  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 701-108(3)(a) was the State Department of Human Services’ 
(“DHS”) September 5, 2013 commencement of an investigation 
regarding the allegations.  Pitolo , 141 Hawai ʻi at 143, 406 P.3d 
at 366.  
II. Background 
A. Factual Background  
 
Pitolo is a former employee of Waianae Community Outreach 
(“WCO”), a non-profit organization funded in part by DHS to 
provide services to houseless people of O ʻahu’s Lee
ward Coast .  
Pitolo left her position with WCO in early May 2010.    
 WCO Executive Director Sophina Placencia (“Placencia”) 
allegedly then discovered some questionable check s written by 
Pitolo on WCO funds on May 27, 2010.  Placencia filed a report 
with the Honolulu Police Department (“HPD”) on August 7, 2010, 
accusing Pitolo  of theft from WCO.  Placencia alleged she had 
discovered eight unauthorized checks written by  Pitolo.  On 
August 16, 2010, Placencia reported to HPD an additional twenty-
nine unauthorized checks allegedly written by Pitolo.  These 
thirty-seven checks included checks allegedly written by Pitolo 
to herself, to her friend and co-worker, Jaym e Windsor,3 and to 
her father, Pulouoleola Salausa.   
                     
3  Jayme Windsor is also referred to as “Jamye Windsor”  throughout the 
record.  For consistency, we use the spelling “Jayme” throughout this 
opinion.   
(continued. . .) ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
4 
  HPD did not further investigate the allegations against 
Pitolo, allegedly because of an inability to locate the 
individuals that were allegedly also involved and based on an 
alleged “failure to obtain additional documents from Ms. 
Placencia.”  As it turns out, Placencia, who reported Pitolo’s 
alleged theft from WCO, had herself stolen W CO funds for 
personal use from 2007 to 2013.    4
 Almost three years later, on July 25, 
2013, WCO filed a 
civil complaint against Pitolo, alleging that, during the course 
of Pitolo’s employment with WCO , Pitolo made various 
unauthorized transactions totaling approximately $762,046.25.  
WCO’s complaint asserted that from 200 7 to 2010, Pitolo 
converted WCO funds to her own use through ATM cash withdrawals, 
debit purchases using WCO’s debit card, and by writing checks 
from WCO’s bank accounts to herself as well as friends and 
family members, who cashed the checks for Pitolo at a local bank 
and then shared the funds with her.5   
                                                                               
(. . . continued) 
 
4  Placencia was charged by felony  information on March 23, 2015 and 
eventually pled no contest to four counts  of Theft in the First Degree and 
one count of Theft in the Second Degree.   Placencia was sentenced to a four -
year term of probation and was ordered to pay a total of $554,495.43 in 
restitution to DHS.   
 
5 WCO’s civil complaint accused Pitolo of issuing checks totalling 
$60,844.60 to  Jayme Windsor, $169,215.00 to Pulouoleola Salausa, and 
$141,190.87 to herself.   The civil complaint also asserted Pitolo  withdrew a 
total of $390,795.78 from WCO’s bank accounts by making unauthorized ATM or 
direct cash withdrawals at WCO’s bank.   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

  After the filing of the civil lawsuit, DHS began an 
investigation and audit of WCO’s finances and accounting 
practices on September 5, 2013.  After Department of the 
Attorney General (“DAG”) Chief Special Agent Daniel Hanagami 
(“Hanagami”) became aware of a news broadcast regarding the 
allegations against Pitolo, DAG began an investigation  into 
WCO’s financial practices  on November 13, 2013 .  Shortly 
thereafter, DAG investigators took over the investigation from 
DHS and obtained all relevant records and documents in DHS’s 
possession.  During its investigation, DAG discovered additional 
alleged unauthorized transactions not specified in Placencia’s 
2010 police reports.   
B. Circuit Court Proceedings 
 1. Felony Information 
 On March 17, 2015, DAG filed the
 felony information that is 
the subject of this appeal, charging  Pitolo with five counts 
(“Counts 1 through 5”) of Theft in the First Degree , in 
violation of HRS §§ 708- 830(2)6 and 708-830.5(1)(a),7 and one 
                     
6  HRS § 708- 830(2) (2006) provides: “Property obtained or control exerted 
through deception.  A person obtains, or exerts control over, the property of 
another by deception with intent to deprive the other of the property.”  
 
7  HRS § 708- 830.5(1)(a) (Supp. 2006) provided, in relevant part:  “A 
person commits the offense of theft in the first degree if the person commits 
theft . . . [o]f property or services, the value of which exceeds $20,000[.]”   
“Theft in the first degree is a class B felony.”  HRS § 708 -830.5(2) . 
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 count (“Count 6”)  of Theft in the Second Degree, in violation of 
HRS §§ 708-830(2) and 708- 831(1)(b) .8   
 Counts 1 through 5 allege that Pitolo, in separate 
continuing courses of conduct, “did obtain or exert control over 
the property of the [State] and/or [WCO] by deception, with the 
intent to deprive the [State] and/or [WCO] of the property,” 
which exceeded $20,000 in value, specifically: 
in Count 1, by 
writing unauthorized checks from WCO to Jayme  Windsor from 
February 13, 2009 to July 16, 2010; in Count 2, by writing 
unauthorized checks from WCO to Pulouoleola Salausa from 
December 8, 2008 to April 16, 2010; in Count 3, by writing 
unauthorized checks from WCO to herself from March 16, 2007 to 
July 6, 2010; in Count 4, by making unauthorized cash 
withdrawals from a WCO account at ATMs from December 27, 2007 to 
May 26, 2010; and in Count 5, by making unauthori
zed debit 
transactions using a WCO account from January 14, 2008 to June 
2, 2009.  In Count 6, the State alleges Pitolo “did obtain or 
exert control over the property of the [State] and/or [WCO] by 
deception, with the intent to deprive the [State] and/or [WCO] 
of the property,” which exceeded $ 300 in value,  by writing an 
unauthorized check from WCO to Young Ho Sim.  Count 6 pertains 
                     
8  HRS § 708- 831(1)(b) (Supp. 2012) provided, in relevant part:  “A person 
commits the offense of theft in the second degree if the person commits theft 
. . . [o]f property or services the value of which exceeds $300[.]”   “Theft 
in the second degree is a class C felony.”  HRS § 708 -831(2). ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 to one check written to Young Ho Sim, and does not allege a 
continuing course of conduct. 
 In each of the six counts, the State alleges the following:  
“the earliest date of the discovery of the offense by the State 
of Hawai[‘ ]i
 or by a person who has a legal duty to represent the 
State of Hawai[‘ ]i and who was not a party to the offense was 
after September 5, 2013, ” which is the date DHS started its 
investigation and audit of WCO.   
 2. Motion to Dismiss 
  a. Pitolo’s Motion and Arguments 
 
On January 12, 2016,  Pitolo filed a motion to dismiss the 
felony information with prejudice (“motion to dismiss”) , 
asserting the State failed to file the charges within the three-
year statute of limitations of HRS § 701- 108(2)(d),9 and failed 
“to accurately state the date of the earliest discovery of the 
alleged offenses in the Felony Information ” as required by HRS § 
701-108(3)(a)10 and State v.  Stan’s Contracting, Inc. , 111 Hawaiʻ i 
                     
9 HRS § 701- 108(2)(d)  (2014) provided:  “ Except as otherwise provided in 
this section, prosecutions for other offenses are subject to the following 
periods of limitation: . . . [a] prosecution for any other felony must be 
commenced within three years after it is committed[.] ”  This section was 
amended in 2016, but those amendments are not relevant here.  
10 HRS § 701- 108(3)(a) provided:  
 
(3) If the period prescribed in subsection (2) has expired, 
a prosecution may nevertheless be commenced for:  
 
(continued. . .) ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
8 
 17, 137 P.3d 331 (2006).  Pitolo argued that pursuant to Stan’s 
Contracting, to rely on the statute of limitations extension 
provision of HRS § 701-108(3)(a), the State was required to 
allege in the felony information 
“the earliest date of the 
‘discovery of the offense by an aggrieved party . . . or person 
who has a legal duty to represent [the] aggrieved party. ’”  
Stan’s Contracting , 111 Hawaiʻi at 34, 137 P.3d at 348
.  
 Pitolo asserted the “date of discovery” of the charged 
offenses was sometime in May 2010, when Placencia discovered 
evidence of the alleged theft.  Pitolo contended that based on 
the alleged May 2010 discovery date,  the statute of limitations 
for all six counts of the felony information expired in 2013, 
well before the felony information was filed on March 17, 2015.  
Pitolo asserted that “ discovery of the offense ” was not extended 
until September 5, 2013 pursuant to HRS § 701- 108(3)(a), as 
alleged by the State, becaus e of dilatory  investigation and 
prosecution.   
                                                                               
(. . . continued) 
(a) Any offense an element of which is fraud, deception as  
   defined in section 708 -800, or a breach of fiduciary  
   obligation, . . . within three years after discovery of     
    the offense by an aggrieved party or by a person who has a     
    legal duty to represent an aggrieved party and who is     
    oneself not a party to the offense, but in no case shall  
    this provision extend the period of limitation by more       
    than six years from the expiration of the period of       
    limitation prescribed in subsection (2)[.]  
   
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
9 
  Pitolo also argued that the circuit court should not look 
to when particular checks were discovered, because discovery of 
one check triggered a duty to investigate.  Pitolo further 
asserted the State may not eliminate particular transactions and 
selectively prosecute transactions found in a later 
investigation to avoid the statute of limitations.   
 
 b. State’s Arguments  
 In response,  the State conceded  that charges based on the 
thirty-seven  checks Placencia allegedly discovered and reported 
to police in May to August 2010  were time- barred,11 but insisted 
that, as charged, Counts 1, 2, and 3 excluded those specific 
checks.  The State argued the felony information was therefore 
timely filed because the earliest date of di scovery for the 
offenses in the felony information was after September 5, 2013,  
when DHS began its investigation, making September 5, 2016 the 
earliest statute of limitations expiration date for all six 
counts.  The State also argued that discovery of one check or 
transaction in a continuing
-course-of-conduct offense did not 
mean that all transactions constituting the crime were 
                     
11  To the extent this concession by the State and statements made in the 
ICA opinion, Pitolo, 141 Hawaiʻi at 142-43, 406 P.3d at 365 -66, can be 
construed to suggest that HPD, not Placencia,  was “a person who has a legal 
duty to represent an aggrieved party and who is oneself not a party to the 
offense” for purposes of the statute of limitations extension provision of  
HRS § 701 -108(3)(a), we note that HPD is not “ a person who has a legal duty 
to represent an aggrieved party ” under the circumstances of this case.  See 
also infra n.15. ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
10 
 discovered, and therefore the full extent of Pitolo’s offenses 
was not discovered until the September 2013 investigation was 
commenced by DHS.  The State also contended the civil complaint 
did not set the discovery date because it was unclear what 
transactions the complaint was based upon or what specific acts 
it alleged, and thus it was unclear what WCO had actually 
discovered and when.  
The State alternatively argued that even 
if the civil complaint established the discovery date
, the 
State’s felony information was timely  filed.   
 
 c. Circuit Court’s Ruling 
 At the hearing on the motion to dismiss, the circuit court 
opined that WCO’s  2013 civil complaint against Pitolo appeared 
to cover the same criminal conduct or scheme as was charged in 
the felony information, and inferred that WCO had sufficient 
information about Pitolo’s  crimes to file suit at that time.   
The circuit court acknowledged that there were two ways to read 
the word “offense” in HRS § 701 -108(3)(a).   One reading would 
mean the limitations period was triggered upon discovery of “the 
specific crimes that were charged,” while a  broader reading 
based on Stan’s Contracting would mean the statute of 
limitations was triggered upon “discovery of the scheme .”   
 On April 25, 2016,  the circuit court filed its Findings  of 
Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Granting Defendant Laura ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
11 
 Pitolo’s Motion to Dismiss Fe lony Information with Prejudice.  
The circuit court concluded that both WCO and the State were 
aggrieved parties for
 purposes of determining a “discovery date” 
under HRS § 701-108(3)(a).  
 The circuit court determined a ll six counts of the felony 
information were based on co nduct that constituted “ one criminal 
scheme,” and discovery of the “offense” under HRS §  701-
108(3)(a) in this case meant discovery of the criminal scheme.  
The circuit court ruled that the discovery date of Pitolo’s  
scheme was either May 27, 2010 or no later than August 7, 2010, 
and the statute of limitations
 for prosecution of the scheme 
accordingly expired on either May 27, 2013 or August 7, 2013.  
The circuit court granted Pitolo’s motion to  dismiss  all counts 
in the felony information with prejudice.   
C. ICA Ruling 
 The State appealed to the ICA, generally asserting that the 
circuit court erred (1) by concluding that the applicable 
statute of limitations expired on either May 27, 2013 or August 
7, 2013, and (2) by concluding Pitolo’s alleged conduct 
constituted a single criminal scheme.  Pitolo , 141 Hawai‘i at 
143, 406 P.3d at  366.  The ICA held as follows: 
 We hold,  inter alia
, that: (1) the State properly 
exercised its prosecutorial discretion in charging Pitolo 
with multiple offenses, even though several of the offenses 
were charged as similar continuing -course-of-conduct crimes 
and the charges overlapped in time; (2) each count of a ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
12 
 felony information constitutes a separate offense for the 
purpose of determining  “the earliest date of the discovery 
of the offense” for the purpose of determining the extended 
statute of limitations pursuant to  Hawai[‘]i Revised 
Statutes (HRS) § 701- 108(3)(a); (3) to the extent that the 
Circuit Court, in effect, treated all six counts charged 
against Pitolo as a single “offense” for the purpose of 
determining “the earliest date of the discovery of the 
offense” in its application of  HRS § 701 -108(3)(a), it 
erred in doing so; and (4) while it is permissible to 
charge and prove an offense covering any part of the time 
span of a continuing crime, and the State was free to do so 
in this case, it is not permissible to disregard discovered 
conduct that is (a) indisputably part of the continuing 
course of conduct, as charged, and (b) that occurred within 
the charged period, in order to avoid the running of the 
statute of limitations.  We affirm in part, vacate in part, 
and remand.  
 
141 Hawai ʻi at 132, 406 P.3d at 355.  Based on these holdings, 
the ICA affirmed the circuit court’s dismissal with prejudice of 
Counts 1, 2, and 3,  but vacated the circuit court’s dismissal 
of Counts 4, 5, and 6.   12
III. Standards  of Review 
A. Motion to Dismiss 
 This court has stated:  
A trial court’ s ruling on a motion to dismiss an indictment 
is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.  The trial court 
abuses its discretion when it clearly exceeds the bounds of 
reason or disregards rules or principles of law or  practice 
to the substantial detriment of a party litigant.   The 
burden of establishing abuse of discretion  is on appellant, 
and a strong showing is required to establish it.  
 
State v. Hinton, 120 Hawai ‘i 265, 
273, 204 P.3d 484, 492 (2009) 
(citations, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted). 
                     
12  The State did not apply for certiorari to request reinstatement of 
Counts 1 through 3.  Therefore, we do not address whether those counts were 
also improperly dismissed by the circuit court.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 B. Conclusions of Law  
 Conclusions of law are ordinarily reviewed under the 
right/wrong standard.  Estate of Klink ex rel. Klink v. State
, 
113 Hawai ‘i 332, 351, 152 P.3d 504, 523 (2007).  A conclusion of 
law that is supported by the trial court’s  findings of fact and 
reflects an application of the correct rule of law will not be 
overturned.  Id.  Additionally, in reviewing a trial court’s 
decision, that court’s label of a finding or fact or conclusion 
of law is not determinative of the standard of review.  Crosby 
v. State Dep’t of Budget & Fin. , 76 Hawaiʻi 332, 340, 876 P.2d 
1300, 1308 (1994). 
IV. Discussion   
 Pitolo prese nts two questions on certiorari: 
(1) Whether the ICA gravely erred in misconstruing 
[Stan’s Contracting], and holding in Counts 4, 5, and 
6, that each count constituted a separate offense for 
the purpose of determining the earliest date of 
discovery under HRS § 701 -108(3)(a) despite the State 
charging Pitolo with theft by deception from a single 
complainant, in a continuing course of conduct, by 
multiple methods, e.g., unauthorized checks, 
unauthorized debit transactions, and unauthorized ATM 
withdrawals, occurring simultaneously during 
overlapping periods of time.  
 
(2) Whether the ICA gravely erred in disregarding HRS § 
701-108(3)(a) and [ Stan’s Contracting ] in applying 
its own transaction test to hold that the earliest 
date of discovery for Counts 4, 5, and 6 required 
that the individual transactions be discovered by law 
enforcement for the statute of limitations to be 
triggered.  
 
We address the questions on certiorari as follows .     ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
14 
 A. The ICA  Correctly Held That Prosecutorial D iscretion 
 Allowed Counts 4, 5, and 6 to be Charged as Separate 
 Offenses and T hat There Are Questions of F act Regarding 
 the S tatute of L imitations Applicable T hereto. 
  
With respect to the first question on certiorari, in 
granting the motion to dismiss, the circuit court concluded, 
“[t]he alleged conduct that serves as the basis for all 6 Counts 
of the Felony Information filed in the instant case 
constitute[d] one criminal scheme.”  In effect, the circuit 
court treated Pitolo’s alleged conduct as a single continuing-
course-of-conduct offense that was discovered at the latest by 
the August 2010 referral 
by Placencia of additional checks to 
HPD.   The circuit court also in effect ruled as a matter of law 
that Placencia was a “person with a legal duty to represent an 
aggrieved party [WCO]  who is one self not a party to the 
offense,” placing the March 17, 2015 filing of the charges 
outside the statute of limitations.   13
 Pitolo argues that the circuit court correctly concluded 
that Counts 4 through 6 are all a part of one continuing- course-
of-conduct offense as a matter of law and that the ICA therefore 
erred by concluding Counts 4, 5, and 6 were separate offenses, 
each with an individual discovery date.  Pitolo argues that 
under Stan’s Contracting , Placencia’s  May 2010 discovery of 
                     
13  See supra n.11.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
15 
 Pitolo’s alleged writing of unauthorized checks constituted 
discovery of Pitol o’s “scheme” to defraud the WCO ; that the 
“scheme” included the conduct charged by the State in Counts 4 
through 6; that Placencia was a person who has a legal duty to 
represent an aggrieved party and was not herself a party to the 
offense; and that, therefore, Placencia’s discovery of  the 
“scheme” in 2010  did not allow HRS § 701- 108(3)(a)  to extend the 
statute of limitations until March 17, 2015, as this was more 
than three years past Plac encia’s “discovery” of the “scheme” in 
2010.   
 We first clarify the ICA’s relevant holding s.  The ICA did 
not actually h old that Counts 4, 5, and 6 are separate offenses, 
as argued by Pitolo.  Rather, the ICA correctly held  that the 
State has wide prosecutorial discretion in framing charges, 141 
Hawaiʻi at 140, 406 P.3d at 363, and that “the State properly 
exercised its prosecutorial discretion in charging Pitolo with 
multiple offenses, even though several of the offenses were 
charged as similar continuing -course-of-conduct crimes and the 
charges overlapped in time, ” 141 Hawaiʻi at 132, 406 P.3d at 355.  
The ICA also correctly held that “ [t]he determination of whether 
a defendant may be convicted of more than one offense, is based 
on ‘whether the evidence discloses one general intent or 
discloses separate and distinct intents,’ is a question of fact ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
16 
 that must be decided by the trier -of-fact after trial[, ]” and 
that, therefore, “ the issue of whether the six separate offenses 
charged against Pitolo merged was not subject to the 
determination of the Circuit Court on Pitolo’ s Motion to 
Dismiss.”  141 Hawai ʻi at 140 n.13
, 406 P.3d at 363 n.13.14   
 Relying on HRS § 701- 108(3)(a), the State charged Pitolo 
with first degree theft in Counts 4 and 5  and second degree 
theft in Count 6, all by deception, and alleged for each count 
that the earliest discovery of the offense by the State of 
Hawai‘i was after September 5, 2013, the date DHS began its 
investigation.  The State clearly had discretion to charge 
Counts 4 and 5 as continuing-course -of-conduct offenses, and 
Count 6 as a separate discrete offense.  See State v. Yokota, 
143 Hawai‘ i 200, 206, 426 P.3d 424, 430 (2018) (concluding theft 
may be charged as a continuing course of conduct).  
 The ICA also correctly determined that Stan’s Contracting  
did not support Pitolo’s position that discovery of “any part of 
the criminal scheme or plan, necessarily constitutes the 
                     
14 Whether a continuing -course-of-conduct offense occurred  is a question 
that sho uld be submitted to the jury, and requires a finding that “the facts 
demonstrate ‘one intention, one general impulse, and one plan.’”  State v. 
Martin, 62 Haw.  364, 368, 616 P.2d  193, 196 (1980) (citation omitted)  (“[T]he 
applicable test in determining whether there is a continuing crime ‘is 
whether the evidence discloses one general intent or discloses separate and 
distinct intents.’”) .  Whether a defendant has one general intent or specific 
intent is a factual question.  See HRS § 701 -114(b) (requiring the State to 
prove beyond a reasonable doubt “[t]he state of mind requir ed to establish 
each element of the offense ”). ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
17 
 ‘discovery of the offense’ for each and every offense charged, 
pursuant to the tolling provision in HRS § 701-108(3)(a).”  
Pitolo, 141 Hawai‘ i at 139-40, 406
 P.3d at 362-63.  Stan’s 
Contracting did not hold that discovery of any part of a 
criminal 
“scheme” necessarily triggers the statute of 
limitations on a specific count, as argued by Pitolo.  
 Thus, t he ICA did not err in holding that Stan’s 
Contracting did not require dismissal of the counts in the 
felony information based on Placenc ia’s 2010 discovery of 
unauthorized checks allegedly written by Pitolo.  For the 
reasons stated, it was improper for the circuit court to 
determine on a pre
-trial motion to dismiss that Pitolo intended 
to engage in a single continuing course of conduct, rather than 
multiple continuing courses of conduct (remaining Counts 4 and 
5) and a single, discrete offense (remaining Count 6), as 
charged by the State.  
See Yokota, 143 Hawai ‘i at 2
06, 426 P.3d 
at 430 (citations omitted).  Therefore,  the ICA correctly 
reinstated Counts 4 through 6.  
 The ICA correctly ruled that “[e]ach count of the F elony 
Information constitutes a separate offense for the purpose of 
determining ‘the earliest date of the discovery of the offense ,’ 
for the purpose of determining the extended statute of 
limitations pursuant to HRS § 701- 108(3)(a).”  Pitolo, 141 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
18 
 Hawai‘i at 141, 406 P.3d at 364.  It follows that the 
determination of whether the evidence discloses one general 
intent or discloses separate and distinct intents is a question 
of fact that must be decided by the jury.  Therefore, although 
the State was free to charge separate offenses, and the ICA 
correctly reinstated Counts 4 through 6, it will be for the jury 
to determine whether there was one general intent as to Counts 4 
through 6 or separate intents as to one or mor e of those counts.  
It will also be for the jury to determine the discovery dates of 
the “offense” or “offenses” “ by an aggrieved party or person 
with a legal duty to represent an aggrieved party ” “who oneself 
is not a party” to the “offense” or “offenses.”     15
B. The ICA Erred in H olding the Earliest D ate of Discovery for 
Counts 4, 5, and 6 was September 5, 2013. 
 In her second question, Pitolo contends the ICA gravely 
erred “in applying its own transaction test, ” to hold “the 
earliest date of discovery for Counts 4, 5, and 6 required that 
                     
15 Although the statute and our legislative history are silent on the 
meaning of a “person who has a legal duty to represent an aggrieved party,” 
because “the Hawaiʻi Penal code is substantially derived from the Model Penal 
Code” we may “look to the Model Penal Code and its commentary for guidance.”  
State v. Aiwohi , 109 Hawai ‘i 115, 126, 123 P.3d 1210, 1221 (2005),  as 
corrected (Dec. 12, 2005).  
 Section 1.06(3)(a)  of the Model Penal Code (“MPC”) is substantially 
similar to HRS § 701 -108(3)(a).  Compare  MPC § 1.06(3)(a)  (1962) with  HRS § 
701-108(3)(a).  The commentary to MPC § 1.06 provides examples of who may 
have a legal duty to represent an aggrieved party, includi ng “a guardian or 
trustee.”  MPC Part I Commentaries, vol. 1, at 91 (1985).   
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
19 
 the individual transactions be discovered by law enforcement for 
the statute of limitations to be triggered.”  The ICA stated 
that the discovery date of the offense by the WCO and/or the 
State of Hawai
‘i for Counts 4 through 6 was September 5, 2013.  
Pitolo, 141 
Hawaiʻi at  143, 406 P.3d at 366.   
  The “transaction test” Pitolo refers to is the ICA’s  
determination that if a type of transaction or type of activity, 
such as the writing of checks to herself, was among those 
Placencia discovered in May 2010, the State could not further 
extend the statute of limitations under HRS § 701-108(3)(a) by 
omitting the checks Placencia had discovered from the offense 
charged in a count covering the same time period and type of 
activity.  Pitolo, 141 Hawai ʻi  at 142, 406 P.3d at 365
.  
Distinguishing this case from State v. Martin, 62 Haw. 364, 616  
P.2d 193 (1980), in which we held a prosecutor has discretion 
“to prosecute under an indictment covering only part of the 
entire duration of a continuing offense,” t he ICA stated:  
While it is  permissible to charge and prove the offense 
covering any part of the time span of a continuing crime, 
and the State was free to do so in this case, we hold that 
it is not permissible to disregard discovered conduct that 
is (1) indisputably part of the continuing course of 
conduct as charged, and (2) that occurred squarely within 
the charged period, in order to avoid the running  of the 
statute of limitations.   
Pitolo, 141 Hawaiʻi at 142, 406 P.3d at 365.  Based on this 
reasoning, the ICA held that Counts 1 through 3, which each ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
20 
 could have included checks discovered by Placencia in 2010, were 
time-barred.   141 Hawai ‘i at 142-43 , 406 P.3d at 365-6 6.    16
 Applying the same reasoning, the ICA held  that Counts 4 
through 6 did not contain any “discovered -but-omitted” 
transactions and that these counts are not time- barred because 
the conduct they encompassed, ATM and debit transactions, as 
well as Pitolo’s single check to Young Ho Sim, were not included 
in Placencia’s report to HPD, Agent Hanagami’s affidavi t, or 
admitted by the State.   141 Hawai‘ i at 143, 406 P.3d at 366.   
The ICA thus held the circuit court “erred in dismissing Counts 
4, 5, and 6, based on its erroneous reading of Stan’s 
Contracting  and its failure to properly apply HRS § 701-
108(3)(a) to the offenses charged in these counts.”  Id.  17
 This court has repeatedly confirmed that “timeliness is a 
factual issue.”  State v. Abdon, 137 Hawai ‘i 19, 26, 364 P.3d 
917, 924 (2016) (citations omitted).  Section 701- 114(e) of the 
HRS requires that to convict a defendant of an offense, the 
                     
16  Again, the State did not request certiorari review of this holding.  
See supra n.12.  
 
17  WCO’s civil complaint against Pitolo, filed July 25, 2013, details the 
same types of transactions and the same time periods as Counts 1 through 5  of 
the felony information, but does not appear to include the single check to 
Young Ho Sim in Count 6.  This suggests that WCO “discovered” Pitolo’s 
conduct some time before DHS began its investigation, and therefore suggests 
September 5, 2013 was not the earliest discovery date for Counts 4 and 5.  
However, as explained above, the State was required to prove at trial whether 
it brought it s case against Pitolo within the statute of limitations  period, 
and the ICA erred, as the circuit court did, in determining as a matter of 
law without factual findings whether the felony information was timely . ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
21 
 prosecutor must prove beyond a reasonable doubt “facts 
establishing that the offense was committed within the time 
period specified in section 701- 108.”  HRS § 701 -114(e) (2014) .  
We have also held that when relying on the extension under HRS § 
701-108(3)(a), “the prosecution must not only allege the timely 
date or dates of the commission of the offense in the 
indictment, but also the earliest date of the ‘discovery of the 
offense by an aggrieved party or . . . a person who has a legal 
duty to represent [the] aggrieved party.’”  Stan’s Contracting , 
111 Hawai
ʻi at 34, 137 P.3d at 348 (ellipses and brackets in 
original).   
 Thus, t wo facts must be alleged in the charging instrument 
and proven beyond a reasonable doubt for a conviction of an 
offense sought in reliance on HRS § 701-108(3)(a): (1) the 
earliest date of the discovery of the offense by (2) the 
aggrieved party or a person with a legal duty to represent the 
aggrieved party.  Id.   Both facts are essential to determining 
timeliness under HRS § 701- 108(3)(a).   
 In this case, for purposes of Counts 4 through 6, (1) the 
earliest date of  discovery  of the offense or offenses by (2) an 
“aggrieved party or person with a legal duty to represent an  
aggrieved party,” and (3) whether the State through DHS is such 
a party, are questions of fact for the jury, and the ICA should ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
22 
 have remanded this case to the circuit court without answering 
those questions.  In addition, as noted earlier, the 
determination of whether Pitolo had the requisite intent for one 
single course of conduct encompassing all six charged counts was 
a question of fact.  Thus, to the extent the  ICA ruled on a 
discovery date of these offenses (or offense) based on discovery 
by DHS, it erred.  
V. Conclusion 
 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the ICA’s November 30, 
2017 Judgment on Appeal filed pursuant to its October 30, 2017 
opinion reinstating Counts 4, 5, and 6 of the March 17, 2015 
felony information and remanding this case to the circuit court
 
for further proceedings, but as further clarified by this 
opinion.
