 Castillo n was stopped by Officer Aron Tomota (“Officer 
Tomota”) for driving with expired safety and registration tags 
on November 19, 2015.  When he asked for her State of Hawaiʻ i  
driver’s license,
  Castillon was not able to provide one.  
Officer Tomota issued a citation to Castillon for driving a 
                         
   
 No person, except one exempted under section 286 -105, 
one who h olds an instruction permit under section 286 -110, 
one who holds a provisional license under section 28 6-
102.6, one who holds a commercial driver’s license issued 
under section 286 -239, or one who holds a commercial 
driver’s license instruction permit issued under section 286- 236, shall operate any category of motor vehicles 
listed in this section without first being appropriately 
examined and duly licensed as a qualified driver of that 
category of motor vehicles.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
contends that Respondent/Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawaiʻi  
(“State”) bore the burden to prove, pursuant to Hawai ʻi Revised 
Statutes (“HRS”) § 286 -102(a) (2007),1 that she did not possess a 
valid driver’s license issued  by Canada or a valid commercial 
driver’s license issued by Canada or Mexico , which would have 
exempted her from  the requirement to operate a motor vehicle 
with a valid Hawai ʻi  driver’s license.  Inasmuch as Castillon  
bore the initial burden to produce “some evidence” to support an  
exemption, and she failed to do so, 
the burden never shifted to 
the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Castillon did 
not have a driver’s license that qualified as an exemption.  
II. Background 
1 At the time of the offense, HRS § 286 -102(a) provided: 
2  
 
   
  At trial, the District Court of the Third Circuit 
(“district court”) rejected Castillon’s argument that she was 
entitled to a judgment of acquittal because the State failed to 
prove that she did not possess a valid driver’s license issued 
by Canada or Mexico.  3 
  The State offered testimony in its case-in-chief that 
established Castillon did not have a valid Hawaiʻ i  driver’s 
license.  Officer Tomota testified that when he 
stopped  
Castillon, he called dispatch to verify whether she had   a 
                         
    
 A person operating the following category or 
combination of categories of motor vehicles shall be 
examined as provided in section 286 -108 and duly licensed 
by the examiner of drivers:

motor vehicle with a revoked license under HRS § 286-132 (2007).  
The citation was later amended to driving without a license 
 (“DWOL”) under HRS § 286 -102(b) (Supp. 2012).  2
A. District Court Proceedings 
2 At the time, HRS § 286- 102(b) stated : 
(1) Mopeds; 
(2) Motorcycles and motor scooters; 
(3) Passenger cars of any gross vehicle weight 
rating, buses designed to transport fifteen or 
fewer occupants, and trucks and vans having a gross vehicle weight rating of eighteen 
thousand pounds or less; and 
(4) All of the motor vehicles in category (3) and any vehicle that is not a commercial motor 
vehicle. 
A school bus or van operator shall be properly 
licensed to operate the category of vehicles that the 
operator operates as a school bus or van and shall comply 
with the standards of the department of transportation as 
provided by rules adopted pursuant to section 286 -181.

   Castillon did not introduce  evidence that she 
possessed  a valid driver’s license in Canada or Mexico.  Rather, 
she argued the State bore the burden to prove that she did not 
possess a valid driver’s license in Canada or Mexico and noted 
that, while HRS § 286-102(a) requires all persons in the State 
of Hawaiʻ i  to be “ appropriately examined and duly licensed as a 
qualified driver” before operating a motor vehicle, certain 
persons described under HRS § 286-105 (2007)  are exempted from 4 
                         
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
license.  Dispatch responded that Castillon’s license had been 
revoked.  At trial, the  supervising driver’s license examiner 
for the County of  Hawaiʻi (“Examiner”) also testified that 
Castillon’s State of Hawai ʻi
 driver’s license had been  revoked  
prior to November 19, 2015 .   The Examiner testified that the 
State’s database precluded her from conducting research 
regarding Castillon’s licensure in Canada.  She did not address 
whether she was precluded from investigating Castillon’s 
licensure in Mexico.  
4 Under HRS § 286- 105(3) and (4), the following persons are 
exempted from the licensing requirements under HRS § 286 -102: 
(3) Any person who is at least eighteen years of age and 
who has in the person’s possession a valid driver’ s 
license to drive the categories of motor vehicles 
listed in section 286 -102(b), except section 286 -
102(b)(4),  that is equivalent to a driver’ s license 
issued in this State but was issued to the person in 
another state of the United States, the Commonwealth 
of Puerto Rico, United States Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, a province of the Dominion of 
Canada, or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana 
(continued . . .)

   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
this requirement, including  those who possess a   valid driver’s 
license issued by “a province of the Dominion of Canada” and 
those  with a valid commercial driver’s license issued by 
“Mexico,  or a province of the Dominion of Canada[.]”  HRS § 286 -
105(3) and (4).   Thus, she claimed, the State bore the burden to 
prove that she did not possess a valid driver’s license in Canada or Mexico.  
Based on the evidence presented at trial, the district 
court determined that the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Castillon violated HRS § 286-102(b) by operating a motor 
vehicle without a valid driver’s license.  Her sentence to pay 
$187.00 in fees and fines was stayed pending this appeal. 
Castillon filed an amended motion for reconsideration of 
judgment and post-trial motion for judgment of acquittal, 
asserting the same arguments.  The district court denied the 
motions.

Islands for that category of motor vehicle which the 
person is operating; 
(4) Any person who has in the person’ s possession a valid 
commercial motor vehicle driver’ s license issued by 
any state of the United States, Mexico, or a province 
of the Dominion of Canada that issues licenses in 
accordance with the minimum federal standards for the 
issuance of commercial motor vehicle driver ’s 
licenses[.] 
5  
 
    
  Before the ICA, Castillon more specifically argued 
that the State failed to meet its burden to prove every element 
of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.  Castillon noted that 
she was charged under HRS § 286-102 which provided, in relevant part, that “[n]o person,  except one exempted under section  286-
105, . . . shall operate any category of motor vehicles listed  
in this section without first being appropriately examined and 
duly licensed as a qualified driver of that category of motor 
vehicles.”  (Emphasis added.)   Included in the exemptions listed 
under HRS § 286-105(3) and (4) are any persons that possess a valid driver’s license issued by Canada or a valid commercial 
driver’s license issued by Canada or Mexico.   Thus, Castillon 
argued, the State was required to prove three elements at trial:  
(1) on November 19, 2015, Castillon operated a category of motor  
vehicle listed under HRS § 286-102; (2) on November 19, 2015,  
she was not examined and licensed to drive that category of  
motor vehicle; and (3) on November 19, 2015, she was not  
exempted by statute from the driver’s license requirements.  
Castillon emphasized that no evidence was introduced at trial 
that she did not po ssess a driver’s license issued by Canada or 
Mexico.  Therefore, she claimed, her conviction was not 5

 6  However, the ICA vacated Castillon’s conviction on other grounds 
and remanded for a new trial.   Castillon, 140 Hawaiʻ i  at 247- 48, 398 P.3d at 
836- 37.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
supported by substantial evidence because the State failed to 
prove an essential element of the offense. 
In response to Castillon, the State argued that the 
defendant bears the initial burden of producing “some evidence” 
supporting this defense before the burden shifts to the State to 
disprove it.  The State alleged the exemptions listed under HRS 
§ 286-105 are defenses because the exemptions are not included 
in the section of the statute describing the prohibited act--HRS 
§ 286-102 (i.e. operating a motor vehicle without a valid 
driver’s license).  Noting that Castillon failed to introduce 
any evidence that s he had a driver’s license from Canada or 
Mexico at the time she received the citation, the State claimed 
that Castillon failed to meet her burden of production and the 
burden never shifted to the State. 
6   The ICA agreed with the State.   Castillon, 140 Hawaiʻ i  
at 247, 398 P.3d at 836 .   In its published opinion, the ICA 
applied the enacting clause test outlined in State v. Nobriga, 
10 Haw. App. 353,  357-58, 873 P.2d 110  , 112-13 (1994),  overruled 
on other grounds by  State v. Maelega, 80 Hawaiʻ i 17 2, 178-79, 907 
P.2d 758, 764-65 (1995).  An enacting clause is “the prohibitory 
declaration of the statute which contains the general or 
7  
 
  
 . . . [W]hen the exception appears somewhere other 
than in the enacting clause, and is thus a distinct 
substantive exception or proviso, the burden is on the defendant to bring forward evidence of exceptive facts that 
constitute a  defense.  The prosecutor is not required in 
such instances to negative, by proof in advance, exceptions not found in the enacting clause.  
 
Id.  at 245-46, 398 P.3d at 834-35 (emphasis and citations 
omitted) (quoting Nobriga, 10 Haw. App. at 357-58, 873 P.2d at 
112-13).  Applying the enacting clause test, the ICA explained 
that HRS § 286-102(a) is the enacting clause of the DWOL offense 
because it describes the prohibited act of driving without a 
license.  See id.   at 246-47, 398 P.3d at 835-36.  The ICA 
determined that the HRS § 286-105 exemptions are described in a *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
preliminary description of the acts prohibited; i.e., the clause 
which proscribes the offensive deed.”  Castillon, 140 Hawaiʻ i at  
246 n.2, 398 P.3d at 835 n.2   (quoting 
Nobriga, 10 Haw. App. at 
357 n.1, 873 P.2d at 112 n.1).  Under the enacting clause test, 
where an exemption to an offense is embodied in the enacting 
clause of the statute defining the offense, the prosecution 
bears the burden of proof.  Id.  at 245, 398 P.3d at 834.  Where 
the exemption is described in a separate provision from the enacting clause, the initial burden of production is on the 
defense:  
The general and well -settled common law rule is that where 
an exception is embodied in the language of the enacting  
clause of a criminal statute,  and therefore appears to be 
an integral part of the verbal description of the offense, 
the burden is on the prosecution to negative that exception, prima facie, as  part of its main case.  
8  
 
   To support its interpretation, the ICA discussed State 
v. Lee, 90 Hawaiʻ i  130, 976 P.2d 444 (1999).   Id.  at 246-47, 398 
P.3d at 835-36.  The 
Lee  court applied the enacting clause test 
to a statute prohibiting operating a motor vehicle without no -
fault insurance, HRS § 431:10C-104(a) (1993 & Supp. 1996).  Id.  
at 246, 398 P.3d at 835.  HRS § 431:10C-104(a) is the enacting 
clause of the offense because it describes the prohibited act of 
operating a motor vehicle without no-fault insurance.  The 
enacting clause refers to a separate statute, HRS § 431:10C  -105  
(1993), which lists exceptions to the offense.   HRS § 431:10C-
104(a).  The enacting clause states, “Except as provided in 
section 431:10C-105  [(the section pertaining to self-
insurance)], no person shall operate or use a motor vehicle upon any public street, road, or highway of [this] State at any time  
unless such motor vehicle is insured at all times under a no-
fault policy.”   Castillon, 140 Hawai ʻi at 246, 398  P.3d at 835 
(first brackets in original) (quoting Lee, 90 Hawaiʻ i  at 132 n.1, 7 
                         
 7  The exceptions described in HRS § 431:10C -105 provide  that the 
no-fault motor vehicle insurance required under the enacting clause, HRS § 
431:10C- 104(a), is inapplicable if either the driver of the motor vehicle or  
the vehicle itself are  self- insured.  Lee, 90 Hawaiʻ i  at 136, 976 P.2d at 450.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
separate provision and, therefore, not  embodied within the 
enacting clause of the DWOL offense.  Id. at 247, 398 P.3d at  
836.  
9  
 
   The ICA found the enacting clause for driving without 
a license--HRS § 286-102(a)--to be similar to the enacting 
clause at issue in Lee.  Id.   HRS § 286-102(a) references a 
separate section of the statute containing exemptions to the offense, HRS § 286-105, but does not define the exemptions.  Id.   
HRS § 286-102(a) states in pertinent part:  “ No person, except 
one exempted under section 286-105, . . . shall operate any 
category of motor vehicles listed in this section without first 
being appropriately examined and duly licensed as a qualified driver of that category of motor vehicles. ”  (Emphasis added.)  
Similar to the exceptions  in Lee, the ICA concluded the HRS § 
286-105 exemptions are not embodied within the enacting clause 
of the offense--HRS § 286 -102(a); thus, the exemptions are not 
“an integral part of the . . . description of the offense [.]”  
Castillon, 140 Hawai ʻi  at 245-46, 398 P.3d at 834-35 (quoting  
Nobriga, 10 Haw. App. at 357
, 873 P.2d at 113)  .   As provisions *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
976 P.2d at 446 n.1).  The Lee  court held that the HRS § 
431:10C-105 exceptions to the offense of driving without no-
fault insurance are only referenced, but not described, in the 
enacting clause.  Id.   As such, the HRS § 431:10C-105 exceptions 
constitute defenses to the offense of driving without no-fault insurance, for which the defendant bears the initial burden of 
production; the exceptions are not  elements of the offense, for 
which the State bears the burden of proof.  Id.  
10  
 
   The ICA further noted that notwithstanding the 
enacting clause test, exemptions are always a defense, and not 
an essential element of the offense, “when the facts or evidence 
concerning the [exemption] are ‘peculiarly within the knowledge 
of the defendant’ or ‘within the defendant’s private 
control[.]’”  Id.  at 246, 398 P.3d at 835 (quoting Nobriga, 10 
Haw. App. at 358, 873 P.2d at 113).  Thus, in accordance with 
Lee, “the statutory [exemptions] referred to in HRS § 286 -102(a) 
are not elements of the DWOL offense, but constitute defenses to 
the offense.”  Id.  at 247, 398 P.3d at 836.  The ICA concluded 
that Castillon bore the burden of introducing evidence that she 
possessed a driver’s license issued by Canada or Mexico, in *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
defined separately from the enacting clause, the ICA held the   
HRS § 286-105 exemptions to be  defenses  to the DWOL offense.  
Id.  at 247, 398 P.3d at 836.  As defenses, the ICA concluded, 
Castillon bore the burden to produce evidence that she possessed a valid driver’s license in Canada or a valid commercial 
driver’s license in Canada or Mexico before the burden shifted 
to the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she did not 
have a driver’s license that qualified as an exemption.  Id.   
Because Castillon failed to introduce any evidence that she 
possessed a driver’s license in Canada or Mexico , the  ICA held, 
the burden never shifted to the State.    Id.  
11  
 
   
  
 
  “Statutory interpretation is a question of law 
reviewable de novo.”  Panado v. Bd. of Trs., Emps.’ Ret. Sys. , 
134 Hawaiʻ i 1, 10 , 332 P.3d 144, 153 (2014) (quoting First Ins. 
Co. of Hawaii v. A & B Props., 126
 Hawaiʻi 406, 414 , 271 P.3d  
1165, 1173 (2012)).  In reviewing questions of statutory 
interpretation, we are guided by the following principles:  
 
 
 
 
 
  
  We concur with the ICA’s analysis in all respects but 
one.  The ICA quoted Nobriga  for the proposition that an 
exemption always  constitutes a defense “when the facts or 
evidence concerning the [exemption]  are ‘peculiarly within the 
knowledge of the defendant ’  or ‘within the defendant’s private *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
part, because she inherently has knowledge or control of such 
evidence.  Id.  at 246, 398 P.3d at 835.  
III. Standard of Review 
A. Statutory Interpretation 
First, the fundamental starting point for statutory -
interpretation is the language of the statute itself. 
Second, where the statutory language is plain and 
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain 
and obvious meaning. Third, implicit in the task of statutory construction is our foremost obligation to 
ascertain and give effect to the intention of the 
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the 
language contained in the statute itself. Fourth, when 
there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, an 
ambiguity exists. 
Id.  at 10-11, 332 P.3d at 153-54 (quoting First Ins. Co. of 
Hawaii, 126 Hawaiʻ i at 414, 271 P. 3d at 1173).  
IV. Discussion 
12  
 
                          
 8  See, e.g., State v. Jenkins, 93 Hawaiʻ i  87, 107, 997 P.2d 13, 33 
(2000) (“Inasmuch as the question whether Jenkins did or did not possess a 
hunting license poses a f act ‘peculiarly within [Jenkins’s] knowledge,’  the 
general rule, which ordinarily would require the prosecution to establish 
that fact as part of its case -in-chief, would be inoperative. ”).  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
control[.]’”  Castillon, 140 Hawaiʻ i  at 246, 398 P.3d at 835 
(quoting Nobriga, 10 Haw. Ap
p. at 358, 873 P.2d at 113).   The 
statement in Nobriga  derives from the thirteenth edition of 
Wharton’s Criminal Evidence , a supplement published over forty 
years ago that has since been updated to clarify the principle.  
Compare 1  Wharton’s Criminal Evide nce  § 20, at 33-35 (C. Torcia  
13th ed. 1972) (stating that a statutory exception   found in the 
enacting clause is  per se a defense when the facts supporting  
the defense are within the defendant’s knowledge or private control),  with  1 Wharton’s Criminal Evidence  § 2:9, at 59 (C. 
Torcia 15th ed. 1997) (explaining that if a defendant asserts an  
affirmative defense, the burden of producing evidence to support the defense first rests on the defendant because it  is “fair and 
makes sense, primarily because the facts in support of such a defense would be peculiarly within the knowledge of the 
accused”).   This court has occasionally applied the rule that an 
exemption is a defense if the facts or evidence of the defense are peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant or in the 
defendant’s private control.   Nonetheless, it is unclear why the 
practice of citing the rule has persisted, as the statute 
8 
13  
 
   Therefore, we concur with the ICA’s conclusion that 
the exemptions referenced in HRS § 286-102(a) and described in 
HRS § 286-105 are defenses to the offense of DWOL, for which  
Castillon bore the initial burden of  production.  We make this 
determination irrespective of whether Castillon had knowledge or 
private control over facts establishing that she had a valid driver’s license in Canada or Mexico.  Because she did not 
produce “some evidence” that she possessed a  valid driver’s 
license that would qualify her for exemption, as set forth in  
                         
 9   “Some evidence” is “such evidence [that] would support the 
consideration of that issue by the jury, no matter how weak, inconclusive, or 
unsatisfactory the evidence may be.”  Maelega, 80 Hawaiʻ i  at 178 –79, 907 P.2d 
at 764– 65 (emphasis omitted ) (quoting State v. Pinero, 75 Haw. 282, 304, 859  
P.2d 1369, 1379 (1993)); see also Lee  , 90 Hawai ʻi  at 137 n.6, 976 P.2d at 451 
n.6.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
describing what constitutes a defense does not impose such a 
requirement.  A  defense is defined as “a fact or set of facts 
which negatives penal liability[,]” irrespective of whether the 
facts are within the defendant’s knowledge or private control.   
HRS § 701-115(a) (2014).  As stated in  Nobriga  and Lee, unless 
  “some evidence” supporting the defense has been adduced, the 
State has no burden to disprove the defense.  Here, if Castillon 
had introduced “some  evidence” that she possessed a valid 
driver’s license in Canada or a valid commercial driver’s 
license in Canada or Mexico, the burden would shift to the State 
to introduce evidence disproving her defense.  9

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
HRS § 286-105, the burden did not shift to the State.   We affirm 
the ICA’s judgment but for the reasons stated in this opinion 
and remand to the district court for further proceedings.
