SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson JJ.)
 
Petitioner/Petitioner-Appellant Albert Batalona appeals
 
from the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ (ICA) August 4, 2017
 
Judgment on Appeal, entered pursuant to its June 28, 2017
 Memorandum Opinion affirming the Circuit Court of the First
 Circuit’s (circuit court) July 17, 2015 Amended Findings of Fact,
 Conclusions of Law, and Order Granting in Part and Denying in
 ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Part Petition for Post-Conviction Relief. 
In 2003, a jury found Batalona guilty of escape in the
 
second degree, theft in the second degree, and theft in the
 
fourth degree.1 Subsequently, the State filed a motion for an
 
extended term of imprisonment, arguing that Batalona was a
 “multiple offender” under HRS § 706-662(4).
2 On January 9, 2004,
 
the circuit court held a hearing and granted the State’s motion
 for extended term sentencing, finding that Batalona had been
 previously convicted of multiple felonies and that an extended
 term of imprisonment was necessary to protect the public. 
Batalona appealed to the ICA. Citing Apprendi v. New
 
1 The Honorable Marie N. Milks presided.
 
2 HRS § 706-662 (Supp. 2002) provided, in relevant part:
 
A convicted defendant may be subject to an extended
term of imprisonment under section 706-661, if  the
 convicted defendant satisfies one or more of the
 following criteria:
 
. . . .
 (4) The defendant is a multiple offender whose
criminal actions were so extensive that a sentence of
 imprisonment for an extended term is necessary for
protection of the public.  The court shall not make
 this finding unless:
 
(a) The defendant is being sentenced for two or more
felonies or is already under sentence of imprisonment
for felony; or
 
(b) The maximum terms of imprisonment authorized for
each of the defendant's crimes, if made to run
consecutively would equal or exceed in length the
maximum of the extended term imposed, or would equal
or exceed forty years if the extended term imposed is
for a class A felony. . . .

Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), Batalona argued that a jury must
 
determine whether an extended term of imprisonment was necessary
 for the protection of the public. Batalona also argued that the
 circuit court was statutorily barred from ordering restitution
 for repairs to the correctional facility arising from Batalona’s
 escape because the government was not a direct victim. 
The ICA affirmed the circuit court’s judgment. 
Batalona then filed an application for writ of certiorari to this
 court, which was denied in 2006.

In 2010, Batalona filed a Hawai' i Rules of Penal 
Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40 petition.4 Batalona asserted that his 
sentence was illegal, reiterating his Apprendi argument as well as arguing that the circuit court failed to enter findings of fact and conclusions of law “specifically illustrating that Batalona could afford to pay restitution” and a fine, citing State v. Werner, 93 Hawai' i 290, 297 (App. 2000). Batalona later 
amended his petition by: (1) adding a third claim that his sentence was illegal because a sentence for escape cannot legally run consecutive to a sentence of life without the possibility of parole; and (2) amending his inability to pay restitution claim to add that there was ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to raise that claim on direct appeal.

 Justice Acoba dissented, with whom Justice Duffy joined.

On July 17, 2015, the circuit court entered its Amended
 
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Granting in Part
 
and Denying in Part Petition for Post-Conviction Relief (7/17/15
 Order). The circuit court granted a hearing on the issues of
 whether Batalona could afford to pay the imposed restitution and
 fine, and whether Batalona had ineffective assistance of
 appellate counsel. The circuit court denied all remaining
 grounds–-including the Apprendi argument--and characterized them
 as “patently frivolous and without a trace of support.” 
On April 27, 2016, the circuit court entered its
 
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order, and Final
 Disposition Regarding Petition for Post-Conviction Relief
 (4/27/16 Order). The circuit court determined that the trial
 court “did not make a specific finding regarding [Batalona’s]
 ability to pay the restitution ordered.” The circuit court then
 concluded that a fine was not appropriate and that Batalona had
 the ability to pay 10% of his wages earned while incarcerated
 toward victim restitution. The circuit court also concluded that
 Batalona’s appellate counsel did not render ineffective
 assistance of counsel by failing to raise the issue of Batalona’s
 ability to pay the fine and restitution. 
Batalona appealed to the ICA the 7/17/15 Order and the
 
4/27/16 Order. In his opening brief, Batalona raised two points
 of error. First, Batalona argued that the circuit court erred in
 
4
 ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
denying Batalona’s petition to set aside restitution because the
 
circuit court failed to enter sufficient findings and conclusions
 to demonstrate that Batalona was able to afford paying $3,149 in
 restitution. Second, Batalona argued that the circuit court
 erred by denying Batalona’s petition to correct his illegal
 sentence under Apprendi and its progeny. 
In its Memorandum Opinion, the ICA held that the
 
circuit court abused its discretion when it made insufficient
 findings of fact to conclude that Batalona could afford to pay
 the amount of restitution ordered. The ICA also held that the
 circuit court did not err in concluding that Apprendi did not
 apply to Batalona’s sentence. Pursuant to its Memorandum
 Opinion, the ICA affirmed the 7/17/15 Order with respect to the
 Apprendi issue, vacated the 4/27/16 Order, and remanded for
 further proceedings. 
In Batalona’s application for writ of certiorari,
 
Batalona presented one question: “[w]hether the ICA gravely
 erred in concluding that Apprendi does not apply to Batalona’s
 sentence.” (Underline added and footnote omitted). 
In Flubacher, we recently stated:
 
[W]e hold that the line of demarcation is Apprendi,
not Booker or Cunningham, in determining whether
extended term sentences imposed without jury findings
are subject to collateral attack.  Accordingly, we
correct the conclusion in Loher and subsequent
opinions that the legal landscape only became clear
after Apprendi (2000), Blakely (2004), and Booker
(2005), were taken together.  To the extent that our
 
5
 ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
prior opinions and the ICA’s prior opinions are
contrary to our holding, they are now overruled. 
Here, a judge, and not a jury, made the required
finding that Flubacher’s extended term sentence was
necessary for the protection of the public.  That
 required finding exposed the defendant to a greater
punishment than that authorized by the jury’s guilty
verdict.  Therefore, Flubacher’s extended term
sentences were imposed in an illegal manner because
they violate Apprendi.
 
Flubacher v. State, 142 Hawai' i 109, 118-19, 414 P.3d 161, 170-71 
(2018) (citations, quotation marks, footnote, and brackets 
omitted). 
Here, a judge, and not a jury, determined in 2004 that
 
Batalona’s extended term sentence was necessary for the
 protection of the public, which is contrary to our holding in
 Flubacher. Therefore, we conclude that Batalona’s extended term
 sentence was imposed in an illegal manner.
 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate in part the ICA’s
 
August 4, 2017 Judgment on Appeal solely as to the extended term
 sentence, vacate in part the circuit court’s 7/17/15 Order solely
 as to the extended term sentence, vacate in part the circuit
 court’s January 9, 2004 Judgment in Cr. No. 03-1-0787 solely as
 to the extended term sentence, and remand this case for further
 proceedings consistent with this order. Because the other issues
 discussed in the ICA’s June 28, 2017 Memorandum Opinion and
 August 4, 2017 Judgment on Appeal are not before us, we do not
 
6
 ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
disturb the ICA’s conclusions as to those other issues.5

 The ICA vacated the 4/27/16 Order and remanded to “(1) determine
 
whether Batalona can afford to pay the amount of restitution ordered and, if
so, (2) issue appropriate findings and conclusions specifically illustrating
that he can afford to pay that amount.”
