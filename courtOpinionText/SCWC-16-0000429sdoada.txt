On April 25, 2002, Respondent/Plaintiff-Appellee State 
of Hawai# i (the State) filed a complaint charging Chatman with 
attempted murder in the second degree when he, 
being the parent or guardian or any other person having
legal or physical custody of [Minor], a person less than 18years of age, did intentionally engage in conduct which is asubstantial step in a course of conduct intended or known tocause the death of [Minor], thereby committing the offenseof Attempted Murder in the Second Degree 
in violation of Hawai# i Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 705-500 (1993), 
707-701.5 (1993), and 707-656 (Supp. 1996). A jury trial 
commenced on May 29, 2003.2 
On June 17, 2003, Dr. Victoria Schneider 
(Dr. Schneider), a pediatrician, was called by the State to testify as an expert on child abuse. After describing the injuries that the Minor suffered, Dr. Schneider asked if she could share a slide show presentation on shaken baby syndrome with the jury to explain how shaking could have caused the Minor’s injuries. Defense Counsel objected. After examining the slides and concluding that they would not be misleading, the 
The Honorable Karen S.S. Ahn presided over the trial and the HRPP 
Rule 40 proceedings.

circuit court allowed Dr. Schneider to testify in conjunction 
with the slide presentation, and asked her to return the following morning on June 18, 2003 to begin her presentation. The court then adjourned for the day. 
The June 18, 2003 trial transcript in the Record on 
Appeal does not contain Dr. Schneider’s testimony on the slide show presentation. Instead, the first page of the transcript 
begins with Defense Counsel’s objection to Dr. Schneider’s testimony. The trial transcript indicates Defense Counsel stated that Dr. Schneider “was rambling on and on, and it looked like a lecture [rather] than testimony in court.” Defense Counsel therefore argued that “[Dr. Schneider’s] rambling narrative had

This omission in the trial transcript contrasts with the HAJIS case 
summary in the Record on Appeal, which notes that on June 18, 2013, the
following occurred:

an undue prejudicial impact on the Defense. And for that reason, 
I would request a mistrial –- in this area or in combination with other areas.” The circuit court denied Chatman’s motion for mistrial, but stated “your record is preserved.” At that point, Defense Counsel began his cross-examination of Dr. Schneider. 
On June 30, 2003, the jury found Chatman guilty of 
attempted murder in the second degree. Chatman appealed his conviction and sentence to this court. We denied Chatman’s ineffective assistance of counsel claims, without prejudice to filing a HRPP Rule 40 petition on those claims in the future, and we affirmed his attempted murder in the second degree conviction. State v. Chatman, No. 26763, 2006 WL 2236740 (Haw. Aug. 3, 2006) (mem.). 
Chatman filed his first HRPP Rule 40 petition for post-
conviction relief in 2008. Therein, Chatman alleged that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to secure the presence or testimony of a witness at trial. The circuit court denied Chatman’s petition without a hearing. The ICA affirmed. Chatman v. State, No. 29504, 2010 WL 1056079 (App. Mar. 24, 2010) (SDO). Chatman did not apply for a writ of certiorari at that time. 
In 2015, Chatman filed two motions in the circuit court

    *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
which we construe as additional HRPP Rule 40 petitions.4 On 
May 18, 2015, Chatman filed a Motion for Correction or 
Modification of the Record (Motion for Correction), and on September 10, 2015, Chatman filed a Motion for Disqualification. On April 28, 2016, the circuit court denied both motions without holding a hearing. The ICA affirmed. Chatman filed an application for writ of certiorari. 
We vacate in part the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal with 
respect to Chatman’s Motion for Correction. Chatman argued in his Motion for Correction that the record contained no evidence of Dr. Schneider’s testimony on the slide show presentation. Chatman further stated: 
[A]s a result of the missing transcript, his due process
right to a record on appeal; which includes a completetranscript of the proceedings at trial, will continue to beprejudiced by his inability to make substantive claims,relating to Dr. Schneider’s Powerpoint presentation, in anyfuture post-conviction or habeas proceedings. 
In his application for writ of certiorari, Chatman contends that 
he “met his burden of proving the existence of ‘extraordinary circumstances’ pursuant to H.R.P.P., Rule 40 (a)(3)” because he was unaware of the missing part of Dr. Schneider’s June 18, 2003 testimony until approximately two years after he filed his first

conviction  proceeding  established  by  this  rule  shall  encompass  all  common  law
and  statutory  procedures  for  the  same  purpose,”  we  agree  with  the  ICA  that
Chatman’s  Motion  for  Correction  and  Motion  for  Disqualification  should  be
construed  as  petitions  for  post-conviction  relief  pursuant  to  HRPP  Rule  40.

HRPP Rule 40 Petition. 
Because Chatman did not knowingly or understandingly 
fail to raise this issue in a prior proceeding, and because he 
has asserted a colorable claim that this missing trial transcript prejudiced his appeal, we conclude that Chatman is entitled to an evidentiary hearing pursuant to HRPP Rule 40(f) on his Motion for Correction.

HRPP Rule 40 (2006) provides in relevant part: 
(a)  Proceedings  and  grounds.   The  post-conviction
proceeding  established  by  this  rule  shall  encompass  all
common  law  and  statutory  procedures  for  the  same  purpose,
including  habeas  corpus  and  coram  nobis;  provided  that  the
foregoing  shall  not  be  construed  to  limit  the  availability
of  remedies  in  the  trial  court  or  on  direct  appeal.   Said 
proceeding  shall  be  applicable  to  judgments  of  conviction
and  to  custody  based  on  judgments  of  conviction,  as  follows:
(1) From Judgment. At any time but not prior to final
judgment, any person may seek relief under the
procedure set forth in this rule from the judgment ofconviction . . . . 
. . . . 
(3) Inapplicability. Rule 40 proceedings shall not be
available and relief thereunder shall not be granted
where the issues sought to be raised have beenpreviously ruled upon or were waived. Except for aclaim of illegal sentence, an issue is waived if thepetitioner knowingly and understandingly failed toraise it and it could have been raised before the trial, at the trial, on appeal, in a habeas corpusproceeding or any other proceeding actually conducted,or in a prior proceeding actually initiated under thisrule, and the petitioner is unable to prove theexistence of extraordinary circumstances to justifythe petitioner’s failure to raise the issue. There is a rebuttable presumption that a failure to appeal aruling or to raise an issue is a knowing andunderstanding failure. 
. . . . (f) Hearings.   If  a  petition  alleges  facts  that  if

It is true that Chatman did not attempt to correct the 
record on direct appeal or in his first HRPP Rule 40 petition. 
HRPP Rule 40(a)(3) provides that “Rule 40 proceedings shall not be available and relief thereunder shall not be granted where the issues sought to be raised have been previously ruled upon or were waived.” There is also “a rebuttable presumption that a failure to appeal a ruling or to raise an issue is a knowing and understanding failure.” HRPP Rule 40(a)(3). 
But here, Chatman presents facts sufficient to rebut 
the presumption that he “knowingly and understandably” failed to raise the claim previously. Chatman notes that he was only made aware of the missing portion of the June 18, 2003, trial transcript when his appellate attorney released the transcripts of the proceedings to him in 2010, after his first HRPP Rule 40 petition was denied without a hearing. 
Chatman could not have raised any claim that the trial 
transcript was incomplete, nor could he have filed a motion for correction of the record under Hawai# i Rules of Appellate

proven  would  entitle  the  petitioner  to  relief,  the  court
shall  grant  a  hearing  which  may  extend  only  to  the  issues
raised  in  the  petition  or  answer.   However,  the  court  may
deny  a  hearing  if  the  petitioner’s  claim  is  patently
frivolous  and  is  without  trace  of  support  either  in  the
record  or  from  other  evidence  submitted  by  the  petitioner.

Procedure (HRAP) Rule 10(e),  until he saw the trial transcripts. 
Therefore, on this record, Chatman has presented facts sufficient 
to rebut the presumption that he knowingly and understandably waived the right to correct the record. See De La Garza v. State, 129 Hawai# i 429, 443, 302 P.3d 697, 711 (2013) 
(determining that because the HRPP Rule 40 petitioner did not have any opportunity to raise the issue of the Hawai# i Paroling 
Authority’s nondisclosure of evidence in any other proceeding actually conducted, he “presented facts sufficient to rebut the presumption that he knowingly and understandingly waived the issue”). 6
Furthermore, we conclude that Chatman has asserted a 
colorable claim that Dr. Schneider’s missing trial testimony may have specifically prejudiced his appeal. On the issue of incomplete trial records, this court has previously stated that “[t]he general rule is that where the transcripts of a defendant’s trial are incomplete because they omit portions of 
HRAP Rule 10(e) (2012) provides in relevant part: 
(e)  Correction  or  modification  of  the  record. 
. . . . 
(2) If anything material to any party is omitted from the record
by error or accident or is misstated therein, corrections or
modifications may be as follows:
(A) by the stipulation of the parties; or
(B) by the court or agency appealed from, either before or
after the record is transmitted; or(C) by direction of the appellate court before which the
case is pending, on proper suggestion or its own initiative. 
8            *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the trial proceedings, such omissions do not mandate reversal 
unless they specifically prejudice the defendant’s appeal.” State v. Kiese, 126 
Hawai# i 494, 508, 273 P.3d 1180, 1194 (2012). 
Here, while Defense Counsel made an oral motion for a 
mistrial following Dr. Schneider’s testimony and the circuit court assured Chatman that “your record is preserved,” the testimony which was objected to was not preserved. This omission may have specifically prejudiced Chatman’s appeal. See id. As such, Chatman’s Motion for Correction alleges facts that if proven would entitle Chatman to relief, i.e., correction or modification of the record. The circuit court erred in denying Chatman’s Motion for Correction without a hearing. The ICA similarly erred in affirming the circuit court’s order on this claim. 
However, the ICA did not err in affirming the circuit 
court’s order denying Chatman’s Motion for Disqualification. Because the circuit court judge in this case has retired, the judge will not preside over any further proceedings involving Chatman. Accordingly, Chatman’s Motion for Disqualification is moot. See State v. Fukusaku, 85 
Hawai# i 462, 474-75, 946 P.2d 
32, 44-45 (1997) (“[T]he mootness doctrine is properly invoked where events have so affected relations between the parties that the two conditions for justiciability relevant on appeal—adverse 
9            *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
interest and effective remedy—have been compromised.” (emphasis 
added)). 
Accordingly, we vacate in part the ICA’s May 14, 2018 
Judgment on Appeal and vacate in part the circuit court’s “Order Denying Motion for Correction or Modification of the Record Filed May 18, 2015 and Motion for Disqualification Filed September 10, 2015.” We remand the case to the circuit court for a HRPP Rule 40 evidentiary hearing on Chatman’s Motion for Correction, in which the circuit court should determine, pursuant to HRAP Rule 10(e), whether correction or modification of the record is appropriate. We affirm in part the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal affirming the circuit court’s order denying Chatman’s Motion for Disqualification.
