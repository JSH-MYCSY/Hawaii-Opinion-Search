2    A bank seeking to foreclose on a mortgage and note bears 
the burden of establishing that the borrower defaulted under the 
terms of the agreement s.  In order  to satisfy this burden and 
prevail on a motion for summary judgment, the bank must submit 
evidence which clearly demonstrates the borrower’s default.  
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (Wells Fargo  or Lender ) sought 
a judicial foreclosure of the residence of Marianne  S. Fong 
(Fong or Borrower ).  In order to prove that Fong had defaulted, 
Wells Fargo submitted a ledger without explaining  how to read 
the ledger.  In the absence of any explanation, the ledger is 
ambiguous and presents genuine issues of material fact.  
Furthermore, although the ledger indicates that Wells Fargo 
billed Fong for lender-placed insurance, there is only ambiguous 
evidence regarding whether Wells Fargo properly charged Fong for 
the insurance.  Thus, there is also a genuine issue of material 
fact concerning whether Fong actually owed the amounts that 
forced her into the alleged default.  The Intermediate Court of 
Appeals ( ICA) consequently erred in affirming the Circuit Court 
of the Third Circuit’s (circuit court) order granting summary 
judgment.  
This court therefore vacates the ICA’s judgment of 
February 12, 2020 and remands this case for further pr oceedings 
consistent with this opinion. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
3 I. Background  
A. Factual Background  
On March 12, 2007,  Fong executed a promissory note  
(Note) for $570,000 to Mortgag eIT, Inc. secured by  a mortgage  
(Mortgage ) on her home in Pepeʻekeo on the island of Hawaiʻi.  
Wells Fargo ultimately obtained the Note from MortgageIt, Inc., 
and was also assigned the Mortgage.   
1. The Note  
The Note obligated Fong to make “monthly payments” for 
thirty years beginning in May 2007.  Under the terms of t he 
Note, Fong was required to pay $3,087.50 per month for the first 
ten years, followed by $4,249.77 per month for the latter twenty 
years.   
The Note further provided that Fong would be in 
default if she “d[id] not pay the full amount of each monthly 
payment on the date  it is due.”  In the event that Fong 
defaulted on her payments, the Note included an acceleration 
clause authorizing Wells Fargo to seek the full amount owed 
under the Note.   
2. The Mortgage  
In conjunction with the terms of the Note, the 
Mortgage obligated Fong to make “periodic payments” consisting 
of the monthly payments required by the Note, any additional 
charges required by the Note, and escrow items.  As relevant ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
4 here, “escrow items” included “premiums for any and all 
insurance required b y [Wells Fargo] under Section 5.”   
Under Section 5 of the Mortgage, Fong was required to 
insure the property “against loss by fire, hazards included 
within the term ‘extended coverage,’ and any other hazards 
including, but not limited to, earthquakes and floods, for which 
Lender requires insurance.”  If Fong failed to purchase and 
maintain the required insurance , the Mortgage authorized Wells 
Fargo to “obtain insurance coverage, at [Wells Fargo’s] option 
and [Fong’s] expense.”  “ Any amounts disbursed by [W ells Fargo] 
. . . shall become additional debt of [Fong] secured by this 
[Mortgage].  These amounts shall bear interest at the Note rate 
from the date of disbursement and shall be payable, with such 
interest, upon notice from [Wells Fargo] to [Fong] reques ting 
payment.”   
Lastly, Section 1 of the Mortgage also authorized 
Wells Fargo to “return any payment or partial payment if the 
payment or partial payments are insufficient to bring the Loan 
current.”  If Fong was up to date on her payments, the Mortgage 
provided that her payments “shall be applied in the following 
order of priority: (a)  interest due under the Note; 
(b) principal due under the Note; (c)  amounts due under Section 
3 [for Escrow Items].”  However, if Fong was delinquent, the 
Mortgage provided that a “payment may be applied to the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
5 delinquent payment and the late charge.  If more than one 
Periodic Payment is outstanding, Lender may apply any payment 
received from Borrower to the repayment of the Periodic Payments 
if, and to the extent that, each payment can be paid in full.”   
3. Loan History  
Between July 2007 and February 2009, Fong regularly 
made payments exceeding $3,087.50 to Wells Fargo for each 
month’s payment.1   
At some time prior to September 10, 2007, Wells Fargo 
apparently determined that Fong did not obtain hail and 
windstorm (hurricane) insurance for the mortgaged property, as 
required under Section 5 of the Mortgage.2  On October 18, 2007, 
Wells Fargo purchased lender -placed hurricane insurance at the 
price of $13,067.20 for the time per iod from July 31, 2007 to 
July 31, 2008.  On August 1, 2008, Wells Fargo purchased a 
second year’s worth of lender -placed hurricane insurance for 
                     
1  It appears that Fong may have missed payments in January, October, and 
December 2008.  Nevertheless, in months where there is no “Amount Received,” 
it seems tha t additional payments were made in the imm ediately following 
months that c ould have cured any resulting default.   
 
2  The record is devoid of any document explicitly indicating that  the 
Mortgage required windstorm and hail insurance .  However,  this court notes 
that an extended coverage endorsement  generally covers damage from 
“windstorm, hail, explosion (except of steam boilers), riot, civil commotion, 
aircraft, vehicles, and smoke.”  See Extended Coverage (EC) Endorsement , 
International Risk Management In stitute, Inc., 
https://www.irmi.com/term/insurance -definitions/extended -coverage -endorsement  
(last visited Apr. 27, 2021).   Here, Section 5 of the Mortgage required Fong 
to insure the property against “hazards included within the term ‘extended 
coverage[.] ’”   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
6 (continued . . .) 
 $13,067.20 for the time period from July 31, 2008 to July 31, 
2009.  It is not clear from the record whether W ells Fargo 
notified Fong prior to either purchase that Wells Fargo would 
purchase and charge Fong for the cost of hurricane insurance if 
she failed to obtain a policy.   
On July 26, 2009, Wells Fargo mailed Fong a letter 
asserting that she was in default ( Default Letter).  The Default 
Letter stated that Fong owed Wells Fargo $22,763.16 in past due 
payments, and that there was a total delinquency of $22,932.53.  
The Default Letter notified Fong that if she did not make her 
payments current by August 25, 2009 , Wells Fargo would 
accelerate the Mortgage and potentially foreclose on the 
property.   
It appears that Fong stopped making consistent 
payments after receiving the Default Letter .   
B. Procedural Background  
On March 23, 2010, Wells Fargo filed a complaint 
seeking foreclosure in circuit court.3   
Over five years later,4 Wells Fargo filed the Motion at 
issue on October 27, 2015.  Wells Fargo contended that it was 
                     
3  The Honorable Greg K. Nakamura presided.  
 
4  At Fong’s request, the circuit court placed the case into the 
Foreclosure Mediation Pilot Project.  Although mediation was initially 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
7 entitled to foreclosure because its evidence demonstrated 
(1) the existence of the Mortgage and Not e; (2) the terms of the 
Mortgage and Note; (3)  that Fong defaulted under the terms of 
the Mortgage and Note; and (4)  that it provided Fong with the 
requisite notice of foreclosure.  As evidence of Fong’s 
purported default under the terms of the Mortgage an d Note, 
Wells Fargo submitted a loan account history (Loan History) .5   
On November 23, 2015, Fong filed a pro se response  
(Response)  to Wells Fargo’s Motion.  In a two-page memorandum, 
Fong asserted that she was not in default.  Instead, Fong stated 
that she attempted to make payments, but Wells Fargo returned 
her payments.  Fong also  indicated  that any alleged default was 
caused by Wells Fargo’s imposition of lender -placed hurricane 
insurance without providing Fong notice.  Fong attached several 
                         
(. . . continued) 
 
scheduled for November 12, 2010, Wells Fargo requested multiple contin uations 
until May 2014.  The parties were not able to reach an agreement, and the 
circuit court discharged the case from the Foreclosure Mediation Pilot 
Project on February 13, 2015.   
 
Wells Fargo then filed a motion for summary judgment on May 26, 2015, 
which was struck due to Wells Fargo’s failure to file a certificate of 
service with its Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) §  667-17 Attorney Affirmation.   
 
5  Wells Fargo’s attachments to its Motion consisted of a declaration of 
indebtedness signed by April J . Linn, a declaration by Robert M. Ehrhorn, 
Jr., an HRS §  667-17 Affirmation, the Note, the Mortgage, the mortgage 
assignment from MortgageIt, Inc. to Wells Fargo, the Default Letter, the Loan 
History, a judgment worksheet, a litigation guarantee and endor sement, a 
quitclaim deed conveying the property from Fong to a personal trust, a 
collection letter, and a document showing Fong was not an active service 
member.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
8 documents  to her Response  to support her claims.  However, Fong 
did not include a declaration or affidavit attesting to her 
claims or certifying her documents.   
On December 7, 2015, Wells Fargo asserted in its reply 
that it had established Fong’s default through t he Loan History.  
However, Wells Fargo did not explain how the Loan History showed 
Fong’s default.   Wells Fargo also argued that the Note “allow[ed 
Wells Fargo] the right to accelerate and require payment of the 
full amount of Principal which has not been paid and all the 
interest that is owed on that amount.  Any payment of less than 
the full amount due does not have to be accepted and refunded 
[sic].”   
On December 10, 2015, Fong submitted an “Addendum to 
Memorandum in Opposition to Motion for Summary Jud gment filed on 
November 23, 2015” (Addendum).  In the Addendum, Fong reiterated 
her claims from her Response.  Fong also stated that she 
obtained her own hurricane insurance policy at an approximate 
rate of $557.00 per year, as opposed to Wells Fargo’s $13 ,067.20 
per year policy.   
On December 17, 2015, the circuit court held a hearing 
on Wells Fargo’s Motion.  During the hearing, the circuit court 
stated it would grant  Wells Fargo’s Motion.   
On May 2, 2016, the circuit court entered its 
“Findings of Fact,  Conclusions of Law and Order Granting ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
9 Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment and Decree of 
Foreclosure Against all Defendants on Complaint filed March 23, 
2010” (Order).   The circuit court found that Wells Fargo 
established the four  elements required by Bank of Honolulu v.  
Anderson , 3 Haw. App. 545, 551, 654 P.2d 1370, 1375 (1982), and 
was entitled to foreclosure.   In particular, the circuit court 
found that, as an “undisputed fact[],”  
Defendant MARIANNE S. FONG defaulted in the observance and 
performance  of the terms, covenants and conditions set 
forth in the Note and Mortgage in that said Defendant 
failed and neglected to pay the principal sum thereof and 
the interest thereon at the times and in the manner therein 
provided, and failed and neglected to pay the additional 
Mortgage expenses, advances and charges incurred or made 
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Mortgage.  
However, beyond stating that it “reviewed the pleadings, 
declarations and the fi les and records herein,” the circuit 
court did n ot address Fong’s arguments that she was not in 
default because Wells Fargo rejected her payments and because 
Wells Fargo improperly charged her for lender -placed hurricane 
insurance.  The circuit court entered its judgment the same day.   
Before the ICA, Fong asserted that the circuit court 
erred in granting Wells Fargo’s Motion because Fong presented 
genuine issues of material fact, namely whether (1)  Fong 
actually was in default; (2)  the lender -placed hurricane 
insurance violated Section 5 of the Mortgag e, including whether 
(a) Wells Fargo should have provided notice before purchasing 
the insurance, (b)  Wells Fargo provided such notice, and ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
10 (c) Wells Fargo could back date the coverage; (3)  Wells Fargo 
properly increased Fong’s mortgage payments; (4)  Wells Fargo 
misapplied Fong’s payments under Section 2 of the Mortgage; and 
(5) the doctrine of unclean hands should have prevented Wells 
Fargo from foreclosing on the Mortgage.   
In a summary disposition order, the ICA determined 
that Wells Fargo satisfied its  burden of production such that 
Fong bore the burden of demonstrating the existence of a genuine 
issue of material fact.  The ICA acknowledged Fong’s arguments 
that “she did not default under the Mortgage and Note and that 
the reason for her alleged defaul t was the increase in cost from 
the lender -placed hurricane insurance, which she claims she was 
unaware of at the time.”  However, the ICA rejected Fong’s 
assertions because “the record is devoid of any accompanying 
declaration or affidavit to support Fong ’s allegations or her 
submitted exhibits.”  The ICA consequently affirmed the circuit 
court’s judgment.   
II. Standard of Review  
A. Motion for Summary Judgment  
A trial court’s decision on a motion for summary 
judgment is reviewed de novo.  Thomas v. Kidani , 126 Hawaiʻi 125, 
127-28, 267 P.3d 1230, 1232 -33 (2011) (citing Fujimoto v. Au , 95 
Hawaiʻi 116, 136, 19 P.3d 699, 719 (2001)).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
11 [S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, 
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on 
file, together with the affi davits, if any, show that there 
is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving 
party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  
Fujimoto , 95 Hawaiʻi at 136, 19 P.3d at 719.  
The burden is on the party moving for summary judgment 
(moving party) to show the absence of any genuine issue as 
to all material facts, which, under applicable principles 
of substantive law, entitles the moving party to judgment 
as a matter of law.  
French v. Hawaii Pizza Hut, Inc. , 105 Hawaiʻi 462, 470, 99 P.3d 
1046, 1054 (2004) (quoting GECC Fin. Corp. v. Jaffarian , 79 
Hawaiʻi 516, 521, 904 P.2d 530, 535 (App. 1995)).  
This court reviews the evidence in the light most 
favorable to the party opposing the motion for summary judgment.  
Thomas, 126 Hawaiʻi at 128, 267 P.3d at 12 33.  When a movant’s 
evidence is subject to conflicting interpretations, or 
reasonable people might differ as to its significance, summary 
judgment is improper.  Nationstar Mortgage LLC v. Kanahele , 144 
Hawaiʻi 394, 401 -02, 443 P.3d 86, 93 -94 (2019) (quoting Makila 
Land Co., LLC v. Kapu , 114 Hawaiʻi 56, 67, 156 P.3d 482, 493 
(App. 2006)).  
III.  Discussion  
A. The ICA erred in affirming the circuit court’s order 
granting summary judgment because the Loan History is 
subject to interpretation and therefore a genuine iss ue of 
material fact exists.  
A party seeking to foreclose on a mortgage and note 
must prove (1)  the existence of the agreements, (2)  the terms of ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
12 the agreements, (3)  a default under the terms of the agreements, 
and (4) delivery of the notice of default.   Bank of America, 
N.A. v. Reyes -Toledo, 139 Hawaiʻi 361, 367, 390 P.3d 1248, 1254 
(2017) (citing Anderson , 3 Haw. App. at 551, 654 P.2d at 1375).   
The parties dispute whether Wells Fargo established 
that Fong had defaulted under the terms of the agreements.  
Pursuant to the terms of the Note, Fong would  be in default 
“[i]f [Fong] do[es] not pay the full amount of each monthly 
payment on the date it is due[.]”   The Mortgage does not include 
any relevant modifications to the Note’s definition of default.6  
Wells Fargo insists that Fong defaulted because sh e “failed to 
make the payments required under the Note and Mortgage, and 
failed to pay the additional Mortgage expenses, advances, and 
charges that were incurred under the terms of the Mortgage.”  To 
support this argument, Wells Fargo pointed out that the Loan 
History shows that the loan was due for the February 1, 2009 
payment.  By contrast, Fong argued that she did not default 
because she made all payments required by the Note.   
Under the circumstances, the Loan History actually 
presents conflicting evid ence regarding Fong’s payment status, 
                     
6  The Mortgage adds that default may occur if either (1)  Fong, or Fong’s 
agent(s), “gave ma terially false, misleading, or inaccurate information or 
statements to Lender .  . . in connection with the Loan,” or (2)  any civil or 
criminal action that could result in forfeiture of the property is begun.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
13 rendering summary judgment inappropriate.  First, the Loan 
History appears to indicate that Fong made her monthly payments 
through February 2009, the alleged default date.  During the 
time frame relevant to these proce edings, the Note obligated 
Fong to make monthly payments of $3,087.50.  The Loan History 
seems to show that Fong made payments exceeding $3,087.50 for 
every month between July 2007  and February 2009.7  Thus, it is 
not clear that Fong defaulted by failing t o make the $3,087.50 
payments required by the Note between July 2007 and  February 
2009. 
Second, the Loan History is largely silent on the 
amount the Mortgage obligated Fong to pay, and thus it is 
unclear whether Fong actually failed to make Mortgage paymen ts 
between the execution of the Mortgage and February 2009.  The 
Mortgage required Fong to make periodic payments consisting of, 
inter alia , the monthly payments due under the Note as well as 
payments for escrow items.  In comparison to the Mortgage’s 
silence on the specific amounts required to satisfy each 
periodic payment , the Loan History only seems to identify the 
periodic payments  due for January 1, 2008; November 1, 2008; and 
                     
7  To the extent the Loan History shows that t here is no “Amount Received” 
for January, October, and December 2008, the Loan History also seems to 
indicate that Fong may have cured those defaults by submitting additional 
payments in the immediately following months.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
14 February 1, 2009.  Despite this ambiguity , the Loan History 
appears to indic ate that Fong made payments to satisfy the  
periodic payments due between July 2007 and February 2009 , 
including the ones identified by the Loan History .   
To the extent Wells Fargo argues that it was entitled 
to reject or redirect Fong’s payments, this arg ument assumes 
what Wells Fargo must prove – that Fong had actually defaulted.  
Wells Fargo claimed  on appeal  that it can reject or redirect any 
payment merely because it was less than the amount purportedly 
due.  However, the terms of the Mortgage only per mit Wells Fargo 
to reject or redirect payments that are “insufficient to bring 
the Loan current.”  Thus, in order to exercise this authority, 
Wells Fargo must first establish that Fong was not current on 
her payments.  But as previously discussed, the Loan  History 
does not unambiguously show that Fong failed to make the 
payments required by the Note or Mortgage such that she was not 
current on her payments  by February 1, 2009 . 
In light of the foregoing, the Loan History is subject 
to interpretation and does  not necessarily demonstrate that Fong 
defaulted under the terms of the Note and Mortgage.  Thus, there 
is a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Fong 
defaulted.  Wells Fargo consequently was not entitled to summary 
judgment.  Fujimoto , 95 Hawaiʻi at 136, 19 P.3d at 719; see also ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
15 Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawaiʻi at 367, 390 P.3d at 1254 ; Kanahele , 144 
Hawaiʻi at 401-02, 443 P.3d at 93 -94. 
As the party seeking summary judgment, Wells Fargo 
bore the burden of proof to establish all necessary elements.  
French, 105 Hawaiʻi at 470, 99 P.3d at 1054.  Consequently, Wells 
Fargo should have  provided sufficient information for the courts 
to parse its ambiguous ledger.  Going forward , Wells Fargo must 
at least submit evidence identifying how much Fong was required  
to pay under the terms of the Mortgage and that Fong failed to 
make the requisite payments.  Wells Fargo may use this evidence 
to demonstrate that Fong was not current on her loan such that 
the Mortgage authorized Wells Fargo to reject or redirect Fong’s 
payments.  To the extent this information is contained within 
the Loan History, Wells Fargo may alternatively submit an 
affidavit or declaration explaining how to interpret the data 
contained therein.  
B. The ICA erred in affirming the circuit court’s order 
granting summary judgment because additional evidence is 
needed to support the Loan History’s purported amounts due, 
creating a genuine issue of material fact.  
Fong additionally argues that she did not default, but 
rather that Wells Fargo improperly forced h er into default by 
improperly charging her for lender-placed hurricane insurance.  
Wells Fargo simply responds that the Mortgage “expressly allowed 
for lender -place [sic] insurance” and that “Fong did not dispute ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
16 that she did not have hurricane coverage as  required under the 
Mortgage. ”  Wells Fargo’s post hoc  argument is unavailing.  
When adjudicating a motion for summary judgment, trial 
courts must “carefully scrutinize the materials submitted by the 
moving party[.]”  See Miller v. Manuel , 9 Haw. App. 56, 6 6, 828 
P.2d 286, 292 (App. 1991).  
Wells Fargo’s Motion filings raised significant 
questions regarding the validity of the purported amounts due.  
The Loan History indicate s that on October 18, 2007, Wells Fargo 
issued a check in the amount of $13,067.20 to  “WNCWD.”  The Loan 
History also show s that Wells Fargo issued a second check for 
the same amount to “WNCWD” on August 1, 200 8.  However, none of 
Wells Fargo’s Motion filings explained what these two checks 
were for.  Instead, it was Fong who pointed out t hat the two 
payments were for lender-placed hurricane insurance.  In 
identifying the payments, Fong asserted that Wells Fargo 
purchased and billed Fong for the lender-placed insurance 
without notice.  Wells Fargo did not reply to Fong’s lack of 
notice asse rtion during the Motion proceedings .   
Again, as the party seeking summary judgment, Wells 
Fargo bore the burden of proving that Fong had defaulted under 
the terms of the Note and Mortgage.  French, 105 Hawaiʻi at 470, 
99 P.3d at 1054 .  Wells Fargo was the refore responsible for 
showing that Fong defaulted by failing to make all payments ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
17 required by the Note and Mortgage.  French, 105 Hawaiʻi at 470, 
99 P.3d at 1054; Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawaiʻi at 367, 390 P.3d at 
1254;  By submitting only the Loan History, We lls Fargo skipped 
the step of proving that it was entitled to all the payments it 
claimed were due – and which led to Fong’s alleged default when 
Wells Fargo redirected her payments.  In the absence of any 
explanation, Wells Fargo’s implication that it was  entitled to 
charge Fong for the cost of these two checks is suspect.  
Even if Wells Fargo had explained during the Motion 
proceedings that the payments were for lender-placed insurance,8 
none of Wells Fargo’s submissions demonstrated that Wells Fargo 
properly charged Fong for the lender-placed insurance.  On 
appeal, Wells Fargo countered that “[t]he Mortgage expressly 
allows for lender -placed insurance” and that “[t]he lender -
placed insurance did not violate the Mortgage.”  Wells Fargo is 
correct that under  the terms of the Mortgage, “[i]f [Fong] 
fail[ed] to maintain any of the [required insurance coverages], 
[Wells Fargo] may obtain insurance coverage, at [Wells Fargo’s] 
option and [Fong’s] expense.”  However, Wells Fargo disregards 
the Mortgage’s limitatio n that the insurance cost “shall be 
                     
8  Although Wells Fargo acknowled ged Fong’s claim regarding the lender -
placed insurance before the circuit court, Wells Fargo did not explain that 
these payments were for lender -placed hurricane insurance until it filed its 
answering brief to the ICA.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
18 payable .  . . upon notice  from [Wells Fargo] to [Fong] 
requesting payment.”  (Emphasis added).   Thus, unless Wells 
Fargo had provided notice requesting payment to Fong, the cost 
was not yet payable.  However, Wells Fargo ’s filings were devoid 
of any evidence that it notified Fong before demanding payment.   
To the extent Wells Fargo relies on Fong’s submissions 
as evidence that Wells Fargo provided Fong notice before billing 
her for the lender-placed insurance, Fong’s fil ings were 
ambiguous.  In its ICA answering brief, Wells Fargo argued that 
Fong’s evidence show ed that she was given notice that Wells 
Fargo would purchase  lender-placed insurance.  However, Wells 
Fargo did not address whether such notice included notice th at 
Wells Fargo would bill Fong for the lender -placed insurance.  
Nevertheless, the  March 2009  letter on which Wells Fargo relie d 
indicates both that Wells Fargo provided notice and that Fong 
did not receive notice  before Wells Fargo billed Fong .  Fong’s 
filing therefore d id not support Wells Fargo’s claim.  
As a part of identifying how much the Mortgage 
obligated Fong to pay, Wells Fargo b ore the burden of 
establishing that it was entitled to the identified amount.

/s/ Todd W. Eddins inconclusive.  A genuine issue of material fact regarding 
whether Wells Fargo could charge Fong for the lender-placed 
insurance therefore remains.  In turn, there is also a genuine 
issue of material fact regarding whether Fong defaulted when 
Wells Fargo apparently redirected her payments to cover the cost 
of lender-placed insurance.  
IV. CONCLUSION  
For the foregoing reasons, the ICA erred in affirming 
the circuit court’s May 2, 2016 Order when genuine issues of 
material fact remained.  
Therefore, we vacate the ICA’s February 12, 2020 
judgment on appeal, which affirmed t he circuit court’s May 2, 
2016 “Judgment on Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order 
Granting Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment and Decree of 
Foreclosure Against All Defendants on Complaint Filed March 23, 
2010,” and remand the case for further  proceedings consistent 
with this opinion.
