 2   This case arises from a contract dispute between DOT 
and Respondent/Plaintiff -Counterclaim Defendant -Appellee Ted’s 
Wiring Service, Ltd. (TWS) .  DOT and TWS entered into a contract 
for goods and services, wherein TWS agreed to build a ground 
transportation tracking system for DOT at the Daniel K. Inouye 
International Airport (“the airport”).  After TWS believed it 
had fulfilled its obligations unde r the contract, DOT notified 
TWS that it was not satisfied with TWS’s performance and 
proposed withholding the remaining balance due to TWS under the 
contract.  
  TWS filed an action against DOT in the circuit court 
to recover the remaining balance under t he contract and DOT 
filed a counterclaim for damages.  Both parties filed motions 
for summary judgment .  The circuit court ruled in favor of TWS, 
finding that there were no genuine issues of material fact  and 
concluding as a matter of law that TWS had comp leted the 
contract  and that DOT accepted the system built by TWS.  The 
circuit court entered a single judgment in favor of TWS and 
against DOT on all claims asserted in the action.   
  DOT appealed to the ICA and argued that the circuit 
court erred by (1) concluding that TWS was entitled to summary 
judgment ; and (2) disregarding the contract’s non -waiver 
provision, which states that final acceptance by DOT does not 
preclude it from recovering from TWS .  The ICA held that the *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
 3 circuit court erred by granting T WS’s motion for summary 
judgment because genuine issues of material fact exist as to 
whether TWS breached the contract , whether TWS satisfied its 
contractual obligations , and whether DOT accepted TWS’s 
performance.  Because the ICA concluded that there was a genuine 
issue of material fact as to whether DOT accepted TWS’s 
performance, the ICA declined to address the effect of the 
contract’s non-waiver provision .  However, the ICA’s decision  
included a footnote stating that DOT ’s appeal did not challenge  
the circuit court’s entry of judgment against it on its 
counterclaim.   The ICA vacated the circuit court’s judgment and 
remanded for further proceedings.   
  In its application fo r writ of certiorari , DOT argues 
that the ICA erred by stating that DOT  did not challenge the 
circuit court’s entry of judgment against DOT on its 
counterclaim.  DOT maintain s that it is still entitled to pursue 
its counterclaim for damages  on remand .  DOT argues that the 
sole issue in this case is whether TWS satisfied or breached  the 
contract and that TWS’s claim for the contract balance  and DOT’s 
counterclaim for damages are  intertwined .  DOT maintains  that by 
appealing the circuit court’s judgment  in favor of TWS, it 
appealed both the judgment in favor of TWS on its claim and 
against DOT on its counterclaim.  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
 4   We conclude that b y appealing the circuit court’s 
judgment, DOT appealed both the circuit court’s grant of summary 
judgment in favor of TWS  on its complaint and against DOT on its 
counterclaim.  Thus, the ICA erred by stating that DOT did not 
challenge the circuit court’s entry of judgment on its 
counterclaim.  Because the ICA concluded that genuine issues of 
material fact exist as to whether  the parties modified the 
contract and whether TWS performed under the contract, DOT is 
entitled to pursue its counterclaim for damages on remand.   
  Accordingly, we vacate in part the ICA’s 
February  4, 2020 Judgment on Appeal as to DOT’s counterclaim and  
affirm the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal in all other respects.  We 
remand to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent 
with this opinion.  
I.  BACKGROUND  
  In June 2000, TWS and DOT entered into a contract for 
goods and services  (“the Contract”) , wherein TWS agreed to build 
an Automatic Vehicle Identification system ( “AVI System”) that 
uses radio frequency technology to help manage commercial ground 
transportation providers at the airport (“the Project”).  DOT 
intended to use the AVI System, which consists of antennas at 
the airport’s entrances and exits, computer hardware, and 
software  to track and meter ground transportation providers so 
that DOT could send them accurate monthly bills.  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
 5   The Contract specifically incorporated  the request for 
proposals (“the RFP”) issued by DOT, which  set forth the 
threshold requirements for the Project.  As relevant here, the 
RFP required the AVI System  to “provide an automated record 
keeping and collection system capable of generating invoices  and 
reports to the user for confirmation of charges/withdrawals .”  
The Contract required TWS to complete performance by installing 
the AVI System within eight months of the date that  DOT issued 
the notice to proceed and then operating and maintaining the 
system for an additional two years  after installation .   
  DOT issued the notice to proceed on December 15, 2000 , 
and the original completion date for the Project was 
August 13, 2003.  However,  work on the Project was  delayed by 
the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks , unanticipated 
difficulties in designing the AVI System, and difficulties in 
obtaining DOT’s approval of the Concept of Operations  (COP) for 
the Project.1  DOT finally approved the COP on  May 19, 2003 .   
  By letter dated  May 27, 2003 , TWS proposed changing 
the hardware in the AVI System to a single server because 
                         
1  While the RFP laid out the threshold requirements for the AVI System, 
the COP described in detail how the AVI System would operate and the methods 
it would use.  The COP was a document developed by TWS  and the Project could 
not begin until  DOT approve d it.   
 In May 2002, DOT rejected TWS’s initial proposed COP because it did not 
meet all of the specifications set forth in the RFP.  DOT requested that TWS 
resubmit a proposed COP for approval that included all of the RFP 
specifications and reminded TWS t hat “any changes and/or adjustments to the 
RFP requires that an [sic] Amendment or Change Order to the Contract.”   *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
 6 technology had improved in the years since the Project was first 
proposed and a dual server was no longer necessary .  DOT 
responded to TWS in writing to acknowledge receipt of the single 
server proposal , stating that it “ha [d] no additional input at 
this time [,]” as “the proposed changes ought to meet the 
specifications  of your contract ,” and DOT would  “defer to your 
knowledge and expertise.”   (Emphasis added.)    
  By letter dated October 15, 2003,  TWS clarif ied to DOT  
the function of the AVI System software  and specified the twelve 
reports the software would generate.  On November 4, 2003, DOT 
notified TWS that it approved of TWS’s description of the twelve 
submitted reports .   
  Because of delays , the parties agree d to extend the 
deadline for installation and testing of the AVI System to 
April 30, 2009.  By letter dated  June 23, 2009, DOT declared TWS 
to be in default of it s obligations under the Contract for 
failure to complete installation and testing  by April 30, 2009 .  
DOT suspended work on the Project the fo llowing day.   
  On October 13, 2009, Travelers  Casualty and Surety 
Company of America (Travelers), the Contract surety company , 
entered into a Takeover Agreement with DOT to complete the 
Project.  Travelers selected TWS to serve  as the completion 
contractor.    *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
 7   By February 2010,  all of the hardware and software for 
the AVI System was installed.  DOT indicated in a letter to 
Travelers that the AVI  System software was  “evaluated and found 
to be functional ” and that the two-year operation s and 
maintenance period , during which TWS would provide support to 
DOT, would commence on February  15, 2010 .   
  On February 15, 2012,2 DOT notified Travelers that it 
was not satisfied with the functionality of the software because 
of errors that occurred when DOT ran the billing report .  DOT 
stated that it would not deem th e Project to be complete until 
the software issue was resol ved.   
  By letter dated March 27 , 2012, DOT wrote to Travelers 
to “acknowledge[] the completion of the two -year operation s and 
maintenance period as of February 29, 2012.”  However, DOT 
stated that it was still not satisfied with the functionality of 
the AVI System software, claiming that it  did not satisfy the 
RFP because it did not provide accurate reports.  Because DOT 
did not believe that TWS could satisfactorily resolve the 
software issues, DOT stated that it was “willing to accept the 
installed system ‘as is’  and consider the Takeover Agreement 
completed [.]”  DOT stated that it would  withhold the outstanding 
balance due under the Takeover Agreement  and use those  funds to 
                         
2 Because the two -year operation s and maintenance period required by the 
Contract commenced on February 15, 2010, the operation s and mainten ance 
period was scheduled to conclude on February  14, 2012. *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
 8 “correct the issues with the current software  on its own accord 
with another software consultant.”  
A. Circuit Court  Proceedings3 
  On July 9, 2013,  TWS filed an action against DOT in 
the circuit court seeking to recover  the remaining balance under 
the Contract.  On July 31, 2013, DOT filed a counterclaim 
against TWS for damages for lost revenue and expenses incurred 
by DOT because the Project was not complete d on time and the AVI 
System software failed to function as expected .4 
  On June 2, 2015, TWS filed a motion for summary 
judgment  on all claims asserted in its complaint and on al l 
counterclaims asserted by DOT.   
  On September 11, 2015, DOT filed a motion for partial 
summary judgment on all claims asserted in TWS’s complaint and 
on all of DOT’s counterclaims for damages, except lost  revenue 
and additional security costs.   
  The circuit court heard TWS’ s motion for summary 
judgment on September 9, 2015 , and heard DOT’s motion for 
partial summary judgment on October 7, 2015 . 
                         
3 The Honorable Jeannette H. Castagnetti presided.  
 
4 In its discovery responses, DOT divided its damages into four 
categories: (1) additional expense to hire an outside contractor to supervise 
completion of the Project; (2) additional security costs incurred because DOT 
was unable to reduce security as planned, once the AVI System was 
implemented; (3) the entire Contract amount; and (4)  lost revenue because the 
AVI System was not completed and ope rating by the original project completion 
date. *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
 9   During the October 7 , 2015 hearing, the circuit court 
ruled that TWS was entitled to summary judgment on its claim for 
the outstanding balance due under the Contract because there 
were no genuine issues of material fact.  The circuit court 
concluded  that TWS “completed the contract as extended and 
modified by DOT and [TWS] ” and “[ TWS] performed under the 
contract to the DOT’s satisfaction, as agreed and modified by 
the parties. ”  The circuit court further concluded that  DOT 
accepted the AVI System.  
  As to DOT’s  counterclaims , the circuit court orally 
ruled that TWS was entitled to summary judgment based on the 
circuit court’s conclusion that TWS did not breach the Contract .5  
Finally, t he circuit court concluded that because “[TWS] is 
entitled to judgment as a matter of law on its claim  for 
retainage and amounts owing as well as the counterclaim asserted 
by the [DOT] , and the [DOT] would not, therefore, be entitled to 
partial summary judgment as the [DOT] has moved for. ”  (Emphasis 
added.) 
                         
5 The circuit court also stated its conclusion that even if TWS had 
breached, DOT did not have a valid claim for damages because (a) DOT did not 
assert a claim for breach of contract based on any untimely per formance; 
(b) if DOT had asserted such a claim, it would not be valid because DOT 
agreed to multiple extensions of the time of performance; (c) DOT did not 
incur additional expenses to supervise completion of the Project based on 
TWS’s conduct, but because  DOT was understaffed; (d) DOT’s claim for lost 
revenue lacked any legal basis because TWS was not obliged to provide DOT 
with revenue from the AVI System; and ( e) DOT’s claim for recovery of the 
entire Contract price failed as a matter of law.   *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
 10   On November 12, 2015, t he circuit court entered orders 
granting TWS’s motion for summary judgment and denying DOT’s 
motion for partial summary judgment.  The circuit court awarded 
TWS the outstanding balance due under the Contract.    
  On May 20, 2016 , the circuit court entered final 
judgment in favor of TWS and against DOT .   
B. ICA Proceedings  
  DOT appealed the circuit court’s judgment to the ICA .  
As relevant here, DOT argued on appeal that the circuit court 
erred by (1) concluding, as a matter of law, that (a) the COP 
changed the Contract specifications ; and (b) that DOT accepted 
the AVI System; and (2) disregarding the Contract’s non -waiver 
provision, which states that final acceptance by DOT does not 
preclude it from recovering from TWS .  DOT requested that the 
ICA reverse the circuit court’s judgment in favor of TWS, enter 
judgment in favor of DOT “as requested in [DOT]’s motion for 
partial summary judgment,” and remand for a trial on DOT’s 
damages.  
  The ICA entered a memorandum opinion (MO) in which it 
concluded that the circuit court erred by granting summary 
judgment in favor of TWS because there were genuine issues of 
material fact regarding whether the COP modified the Contract 
specifications and whether DOT finally accepted the AVI System  
under the terms of the Contract .  Because there was a genuine *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
 11 issue of material fact about whether DOT accepted the AVI 
System, the ICA declined to address the effect of the  Contract’s 
non-waiver provision.  The ICA did not address the question of 
whether TWS was entitled to summary judgment as to DOT’s 
counterclaim, stating in footnote 6 of its MO: “TWS also argued 
that it was entitled to judgment as to DOT’s counterclaim for 
damages under the contract.  DOT has not challenged the Circuit 
Court’s entry of judgment against it on its counterclaim on 
appeal.”  (Emphasis added .)   
  Accordingly, the ICA vacated the circuit court’s 
May 20, 2016 Judgment in favor of TWS and against DOT and 
remanded for further proceedings  “not inconsistent” with its MO .  
The ICA entered its Judgment on A ppeal on February 4 , 2020. 
II.  DISCUSSION  
  In its application for writ of certiorari, DOT argues 
that the ICA erred by stating in footnote 6 of its MO that “DOT  
has not challenged the Circuit Court’s entry of judgment ag ainst 
it on its counterclaim on appeal.”  DOT contends that by 
appealing the ci rcuit court’s judgment  in favor of TWS and 
against DOT, it appealed all claims asserted in the action — 
which encompassed both the award of the remaining balance of the 
Contract in favor of TWS and DOT’s counterclaim for damages.  
According to DOT, the sole issue in this case is whether TWS 
performed under the Contract  and the parties ’ competing claims *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
 12 regarding whether the Contract was modified and whether DOT 
accepted the AVI System are inextricably intertwined.  DOT 
contends that footnote 6 contradicts the ICA’s conclusion that 
TWS was not entitled to summary judgment because there were 
genuine issues of material fact as to which party defaulted on 
the Contract.  Accordingly, DOT maintains that it is still 
entitled to pursue its counterclaim for damages against TWS on 
remand. 
Conclusions of law are reviewed de novo under the 
right/wrong standard of review.  Maria v. Freitas , 73 Haw. 266, 
270, 832 P.2d 259, 262 (1992).   In this case, the ICA concluded 
as a matter of  law that the circuit court erred by granting 
summary judgment in favor of TWS and against DOT because genuine 
issues of material fact exist.  The ICA also concluded that DOT 
failed to challenge on appeal the circuit court’s entry of 
judgment against it on  its counterclaim for damages.6  For the 
following reasons,  we agree with DOT that footnote 6 is wrong .  
The ICA erred by concluding that DOT appealed only the entry of 
judgment in favor of TWS on its claim and  did not appeal the 
circuit court’s judgment on its  counterclaim.    
                         
6 We note that the ICA cited no basis for its conclusion in footnote 6 
that “DOT has not challenged the Circuit Court’s entry of judgment against it 
on its counterclaim on appeal.”   
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
 13   First, the circuit court issued a single judgment in 
favor of TWS and against DOT  “on all claims asserted in the 
action.”7  Pursuant to Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 
3(c)(2) (2019), “[t]he notice of appeal shall designate the  
judgment, order, or part thereof  and the court . . . appealed 
from[]” and “[a]  copy of the judgment or  order shall be attached 
as an exhibit. ”  (Emphasis added.)  In this case, DOT filed a 
Notice of Appeal “from the [circuit court ]’s JUDGMENT filed May 
20, 2016”  and attached a copy of the judgment as Exhibit 1.  
Thus, DOT appealed the entire judgment , and its appeal 
necessarily encompassed both the circuit court’s grant of 
summary judgment in favor of TWS on its complain t and against 
DOT on its counterclaim.   
  Second, DOT’s appeal in no way  indicated that it was 
abandoning its counterclaim for damages.  Instead, in its 
opening and reply briefs , DOT maintained its position that it 
was TWS who breached the Contract .  DOT disputed TWS’s claims 
that (1) the parties modified  the Contract ; (2) TWS performed 
under the Contract , as modified ; and (3) DOT issued a final 
acceptance.  Thus, DOT’s arguments that TWS breached the 
Contract  and that DOT was  entitled to damages were the same 
                         
7 Not only did the circuit court enter a single judgment, it also treated 
TWS’s complaint and DOT’s counterclaim as a single issue by addressing their 
cross-motions for summary judgment in one oral ruling and stating that “a lot 
of the issues in both motions . . . just overlap.”  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
 14 arguments made by DOT for why TWS was not entitled to the 
remaining balance under  the Contract.  It follows that if there 
were genuine issues of material fact as to which party breached 
the Contract, DOT is entitled to pursue its claim for damages on 
remand.   
  Third, DOT specifically challenged on appeal the 
circuit court’s failure “to give effect to the non -waiver 
provision  of the contract ,” which is only relevant to DOT’s 
counterclaim for damages.  DOT argued to the ICA that the non -
waiver provisio n entitled  DOT to seek damages  from TWS , even if 
the circuit court found that TWS did not breach the Contract .  
In addition, t he relief that DOT requested on appeal was for the 
ICA to reverse the circuit court’s judgment in favor of TWS, 
enter judgment in favor of DOT “ as requested in [DOT]’s motion 
for partial summary judgment ,” and remand for a trial on DOT’s 
damages.   (Emphasis added.)  
  Thus, DOT’s appeal of the circuit court’s jud gment 
encompassed both the entry of judgment in favor of TWS for the 
remaining balance under the Contract and DOT’s counterclaim for 
damages.   To the extent that the ICA concluded that DOT  
failed to  challenge  on appeal the circuit court’s entry of 
judgment ag ainst DOT on its counterclaim , the ICA erred.  The *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
 15 
ICA vacated the circuit court’s judgment8 because it  concluded 
that genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether DOT 
agreed to modify the Contract specifications and whether DOT 
accepted the AVI System.  For that reason , DOT is entitled to 
pursue its counterclaim for damages against TWS  on remand . 
III.  CONCLUSION  
  Accordingly, we vacate in part the ICA’s 
February  4, 2020 Judgment on Appeal as to DOT’s counterclaim and 
affirm the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal in all other respects.  We 
remand to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent 
with this opinion.

8 To “vacate” a judgment is to “nullify or cancel; make void; invalidate”  
it.  Black’s Law Dictionary  1862 (11th ed. 2019).  Thus, because the ICA 
vacated the circuit court’s judgment which disposed of DOT’s counterclaim for 
damages, the judgment is void and DOT’s counterclaim necessarily survives.
