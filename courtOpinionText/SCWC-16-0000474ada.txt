CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS

OPINION OF THE COURT BY POLLACK, J.  
  In this case, Christopher Grindling brought a petition 
for post-conviction relief contending that  the trial court 
violated his constitutional right to have each element of an 
offense proven beyond a reasonable doubt,  when the court 
accepted a stipulation to elements  of the charged offenses  
without engaging him in a colloquy to obtain his consent.  
Grindling also argued that he received ineffective assistance of Electronically Filed

2 trial and appellate counsel relating to the trial court’s error 
in accepting the stipulation.  The circuit court granted 
Grindling’s petition, concluding that the trial court’s failure 
to conduct a colloquy with  Grindling was plain error and that 
Grindling had received ineffective assistance both at trial and 
on appeal.   
  On appeal, the Intermedia te Court of Appeals (ICA) 
held that plain error review was improper in a post-conviction 
proceeding.   The ICA vacated the circuit court decision and 
remanded the case to afford Grindling’s trial and appellate 
counsel an opportunity to address the ineffective assistance 
claims. 
  On review, we reaffirm that it is the duty of the 
trial court to conduct a colloquy with the defendant to obtain a 
knowing and voluntary waiver of the constitutional right to have 
each element of the charged offenses proven beyond a reasonable 
doubt; therefore , a court’s failure to comply with this duty is 
not grounds for finding ineffective assistance of trial counsel.  
We further hold that plain error review applies to post-
conviction proceedings, and the circuit court correctly noticed  
plain error in this case.  We therefore vacate the ICA’s 
judgment on appeal and affirm the circuit court decision on this 
ground.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
3 I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
A. Background 
  After law 
enforcement recovered suspected  
methamphetamine and drug paraphernalia from his residence and 
vehicle while executing two search warrants, Christopher 
Grindling was charged on August 31, 2007 with promoting a 
dangerous drug in the third degree in violation of § 712- 1243(1) 
(1993)1 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) and p rohibited a cts 
related to drug paraphernalia in violation of HRS § 329-43.5(a) 
(1993).2  
  
In September 2007, Grindling appeared for arraignment 
in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (trial court or 
circuit court as specified3) and entered pleas of not guilty.  In 
the months that followed, Grindling filed numerous pro se 
motions, including a motion to dismiss his counsel, Cary Virtue , 
                     
 1 HRS § 712 -1243(1) provides in relevant part that “[a] person 
commits the offense of promoting a dangerous drug in the third degree if the 
person knowingly possesses any dangerous drug in any amount.”  
 2 HRS § 329 -43.5(a) stated in relevant part,  
It is unlawful for any person to use, or to possess with 
intent to use, drug paraphernalia to plant, propagate, 
cultivate, grow, harvest, manufacture, compound, convert, 
produce, process, prepare, test, analyze, pack, repack, 
store, contain, conceal, inject, ingest, inhale, or 
otherwise introduce into the human body a controlled 
substance in violation of this chapter.   
 3 In this opinion, “trial court” refers to the court  that presided 
over the trial and remand proceedings  in Grindling’s case, and “circuit 
court” refers to the court that presided over the post -conviction 
proceedings.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
4 Esq., which was denied, and a subsequent motion to waive 
counsel.4    
 
 At a hearing in March 2008, Grindling clarified that 
he did not really want to waive counsel but did not wish to be 
represented by Virtue.   After the court determined that 
Grindling had not made a showing that justified appointing 
replacement counsel, t he trial court granted Grindling’s motion 
to waive counsel and appointed Virtue as standby counsel.  At a 
later hearing, the court reconsidered its determination, 
discharged Virtue, and appointed substitute counsel.   In June 
2008, substitute counsel moved to withd raw, and the trial court 
appointed Steven Songstad, Esq., as counsel  and indicated that 
Songstad would be Grindling’s last court -appointed counsel.  
  J ury trial commenced on August 4, 2008.   During trial,  
the State informed the court that the parties had entered into a 
stipulation establishing the chain of custody and receipt into 
evidence of four packets and a pipe recovered in the search of 
Grindling’s residence and vehicle , and that the results  of 
chemical testing of the packets’ contents and the pipe residue 
identified the presence of methamphetamine.   The trial court did 
                     
 4 The Honorable Shackley F. Raffetto presided over the trial and 
remand proceedings.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
5 not address Grindling regarding the stipulation, and the State  
read the stipulation to the jury. 
 
 The jury convicted Grindling on both charges, and the 
court sentenced Grindling to five years in prison on  each count , 
with the terms to run consecutively (judgment of conviction).  
Grindling was also required  to pay a $105 Crime Victim 
Compensation fee in each count.   
B. Appeal 
 
 Cynthia Kagiwada, Esq.,  replaced Songstad as 
Grindling’s counsel on appeal  after Songstad moved to withdraw 
as counsel.  After the filing of the opening brief in the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA), Grindling filed a pro se 
pleading entitled “Ex Part e Objection to Court Appointed 
Counsel,” and later, a supplement to the opening brief.5  Neither 
the opening brief nor Grindling’s supplement to the opening 
brief raised any points of error concerning the trial court’s 
acceptance of the evidentiary stipulation.  
 
 Thereafter, the ICA granted a motion by Kagiwada to  
remand the case to the trial court for consideration of a motion 
to withdraw as counsel.  During the remand hearing, the trial 
court allowed Kagiwada to withdraw from representing Grindling.  
                     
 5 The State filed an ex parte motion to strike the supplement to 
opening brief, which the ICA granted over Grindling’s opposition.    ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
6 The court then entered into a discussion with Grindling 
regarding his lack of counsel
.  Grindling stated that he wanted 
a lawyer but expressed his frustration with his previous court-
appointed attorneys.  This led to the following exchange:  
THE COURT: All right.  Well, what do you want to do about a 
lawyer, you gonna represent yourself or what?  
THE DEFENDANT : I want an attorney, but I don’t want [] 
another one that does  nothing, therefore I have no choice 
but to represent myself.  
THE COURT : That’s– -if you–- 
THE DEFENDANT: I am forced into it due [to] the fact that 
these attorneys don’t want to do anything.  
. . . . 
THE COURT: . . . You know, we’ve had these discussions 
several times about what a bad idea that is; you remember 
all that?  
THE DEFENDANT: And yeah, and I agree with you.  It is a bad 
idea, but I am forced into it. . . .  
. . . . 
THE COURT: I just want to know quite clearly that you –-you 
want to represent yourself.  If that is what you want to 
do, then that’s fine.   I just want to make sure that you 
are clear about that.  
THE DEFENDANT: Yeah. I– -I-–I–-we are clear about that.  
Like I said, I -–I have no choice. . . . 
The trial court at this point det ermined Grindling had waived 
his right to appointed counsel “based on [his] collective 
behavior with [his] five previous counsel” and that he would 
represent himself on appeal .6     
                     
 6 Grindling, pro se, filed a motion to effectively reinstate his 
supplement to the opening Brief, which the ICA granted.  The State filed a 
supplemental answering brief to which Grindling filed a reply.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
7 On March 19, 2010, t he ICA issued a Summary 
Disposition Order (SDO) in which it determined  that the trial 
court should have held an evidentiary hearing to establish 
Grindling’s objections on the record to ascertain the bases for 
his request for replacement of Virtue as his trial counsel.7  The 
ICA also concluded that although Grindling moved to waive his 
right to counsel, “he really wanted substitute counsel. ”  The 
ICA found, however, that these errors were harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt because Grindling was without counsel for only 
about one week, approximately
 four months before trial began.  
Accordingly, the ICA affirmed the judgment of conviction. 
C. HRPP Rule 40 Proceedings 
  
On April 4, 2012, Grindling filed a “Petition to 
Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release 
Petitioner From Custody ” (Petition8) in the circuit court 
pursuant to 
Hawai‘i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40,  
alleging that he had not been given access to correctional 
programs, which resulted  in his being denied parole.9   
                     
 7 The ICA’s SDO can be found at State v. Grindling, No. 29307, 2010 
WL 1020355 (App. Mar. 19, 2010).  
 8 The Petition was amended and supplemented with additional claims .  
The term “Petition” refers collectively to these supplemental filings  as 
well. 
 9 HRPP Rule 40(a) provides in relevant part:  
 
(continued . .  .) ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
8 Grindling later filed amendments to the Petition  in May 
2012, alleging eight grounds.  The circuit court issued an 
order, finding that Grindling ’s Petition  raised potentially 
colorable claims that had not been waived or previously 
ruled upon with regard to, inter alia,  his assertions of 
ineffective assistance of appellate counsel and denial of 
counsel on appeal.  10
  In 2016, Grindling , now represented by counsel, filed 
a motion to supplement the Petition , which the circuit court 
granted.  The supplemental g round asserted  that Grindling’s  
state and federal constitutional rights to a fair trial were 
violated when the circuit court, prior to accepting the 
stipulation, failed to conduct an on-the -record colloquy with 
him regarding his waiver of the  right to proof of an element of 
a charge.  Grindling also contended that that his federal and 
                                                                        
(. . . continued) 
 
(a) Proceedings and Grounds.  The post -conviction 
proceeding established by this rule shall encompass all 
common law and statutory procedures for the same purpose, 
including habeas corpus and coram nobis; provided that the 
foregoing shall not be construed to limit the availability 
of remedies in the trial court or on direct appeal.  Said 
proceeding shall be applicable to judgments of conviction 
and to custody based on judgments of conviction  . . . . 
The Honorable Joseph E. Cardoza presided over the Rule 40 proceedings.  
 10 In May 2014,  Grindling filed an amended petition, pro se, in 
which he raised six grounds, several of which reiterated claims that the 
circuit court had previously found colorable.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
9 state constitutional rights to effective assistance of trial and 
appellate counsel were violated by his trial counsel’s inaction 
and appellate counsel’s failure to raise the trial court’s error 
on appeal.   
  In response to the claims raised in the supplemental 
ground, the State argued that Grindling waived the se claims when 
he represented himself pro se on direct appeal, engaged in 
conduct that demonstrated his desire to reject counsel,  and 
failed to raise the issue in a separate HRPP Rule 40 petition 
that he had filed in 2015 (2015 Petition), which had been 
assigned to a different  circuit court judge and denied.   
  At a hearing held on the Petition, t he State conceded 
that the trial court erred when it did not enter into a colloquy 
with Grindling with regard to the stipulation, but  the State 
argued that the trial court’s omission was not plain error.  The 
circuit court disagreed,  finding that the stipulation 
“established proof of an element to the offenses charged, i.e. 
the presence of methamphetamine,” and concluding that the trial  
court’s failure to conduct the colloquy was plain error.  In 
addition, the circuit court found that Grindling was denied his 
constitutional right to the effective assistance of trial 
counsel when Song stad did not request a colloquy or object to 
the trial court’s omission , as well as his constitutional right 
to the effective assistance of appellate counsel when Kagiwada  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
10 failed to raise th e trial court’s  error on appeal .  On June 14, 
2016, the circuit court issued “Findings of Fact, Conclusions of 
Law, and Order Granting Supplemental Ground to Petition to 
Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner 
from Custody
” (Order Granting Petition) and ordered that a new 
trial be held.  The State timely appealed. 
D. ICA Proceedings 
  Before the ICA, t he State argued that Grindling could 
have raised the supplemental claims on direct appeal or in the 
2015 Petition and thus those claims were waived
.  The State also 
contended that Grindling should be judicially estopped from 
raising a claim based on ineffective assistance of appellate 
counsel because he represented himself on direct appeal and that 
the circuit court applied the wrong standard with respect to 
Grindling’s ineffective assistance of counsel claims
.   
 
 The ICA issued an  SDO on April 5, 2018.11  The ICA held 
that the circuit court did not err in ruling that there was no 
waiver of Grindling’s supplemental claims, pointing to the 
circuit court’s unchallenged find ing that Grindling “ has 
consistently requested the assistance of counsel” through all 
stages of this case.  However, the ICA concluded that the 
                     
 11 The ICA’s SDO can be found at Grindling v. State, No. CAAP -16-
0000474, 2018 WL 1633820 (App. April 5, 2018).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
11 “circuit court’s application of a plain error standard of review 
to Grindling’s collateral attack on his conviction was 
improper.”  Quoting United States v. Frady, 456 U.S. 152 (1982), 
the ICA noted that there is a “well-settled principle that to 
obtain collateral relief a prisoner must clear a significantly 
higher hurdle than would exist on direct appeal,” and held that 
the circuit court therefore should only have applied the 
standard for ineffective assistance of trial and appellate 
counsel.  (Quoting 456 U.S. at 164-66.)   
  T he ICA th us ruled that the circuit court erred by 
applying a plain error standard of review to Grindling’s 
“collateral attack on his convictions” rather than the standard 
for ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel.  And, 
because the record did not indicate that Songstad or Kagiwada 
had an opportunity to address Grindling’s claim that they were 
constitutionally ineffective as required by HRPP Rule 40(f),12 
                     
 12  HRPP Rule 40(f) states in relevant part as follows:  
Where the petition alleges the ineffective assistance of 
counsel as a ground upon which the requested relief should 
be granted, the petitioner shall serve written notice of 
the hearing upon the counsel whose assistance is alleged to 
have been ineffective and said counsel shall have an 
opportunity to be heard.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
12 the ICA vacated the circuit court’s Order Granting Petition and 
remanded the case to the circuit court for further proceedings.13   
II. STANDARD S OF REVIEW 
  We consider a court’s conclusions of law regarding a 
petition for post-conviction relief de novo, including its 
determination of whether a claim is waived under HRPP Rule 
40(a)(3).  Fragiao v. State, 95 Hawai ‘i 9, 15, 18 P.3d 871, 877 
(2001).  A court’s findings of fact in connection with a 
petition for post-conviction relief are reviewable under the 
clearly erroneous standard.  
Wilton v. State, 116 Hawai ‘i 106, 
110 n.7, 170 P.3d 357, 361 n.7 (2007). 
III. DISCUSSION    
  
In its application for writ of certiorari, the State 
contends that the ICA gravely erred when it upheld the circuit 
court’s determination that Grindling did not waive his 
supplemental claims in the Petition.14  
                     
 13 The State also maintained on appeal that the circuit court 
erroneously allowed Grindling to re -litigate and obtain discovery, inter 
alia, on previously ruled upon claims.  The ICA did not address the merits of 
this challenge.    
 14 The State also argues that the circuit court erred when it 
disregarded its argument regarding Grindling’s re -litigation of his discovery 
claims.  The State maintains  that upon remand, Grindling will continue to 
attempt to re- litigate pre -trial discovery issues that have been previously 
ruled upon.  Accordingly, the State requests that this Court provide guidance 
on this point. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
13 A. Grindling Did Not Waive His Right to Counsel by Conduct 
Because He Was Not Presented w ith a Clear Choice to Continue 
with Present Counsel.  
 
 Waiver in a HRPP Rule 40 proceeding is governed by 
HRPP Rule 40(a)(3), which provides that “an issue is waived if 
the petitioner knowingly and understandingly failed to raise 
it,” when it could have been raised previously , unless the 
petitioner is able to show the  existence of extraordinary 
circumstances to justify the petitioner ’s failure to raise the 
issue.15  There is a rebuttable presumption that a petitioner’s 
failure to appeal a ruling or to raise a potential  issue in a 
prior proceeding is a knowing and understanding failure.   HRPP 
Rule 40(a)(3). 
 
 The State argues that both the circuit court and the 
ICA erred in concluding that Grindling did not waive his 
supplemental claims when they were  not raised in the supplement 
                     
 15 HRPP Rule 4 0(a)(3) provides as follows:  
(3) INAPPLICABILITY .  Rule 40 proceedings shall not be 
available and relief thereunder shall not be granted where 
the issues sought to be raised have been previously ruled 
upon or were waived.  Except for a claim of illegal 
sentence, an issue is waived if the petitioner knowingly 
and understandingly failed to raise it and it could have 
been raised before the trial, at the trial, on appeal, in a 
habeas corpus proceeding or any other proceeding actually 
conducted, or in a prior proceeding actually initiated 
under this rule, and the petitioner is unable to prove the 
existence of extraordinary circumstances to justify the 
petitioner's failure to raise the issue.  There is a 
rebuttable presumption that a failure to appeal a ruling or 
to raise an issue is a knowing and understanding failure.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
14 to his opening brief on direct appeal.  The State points to the 
trial court’s 
determination on remand that Grindling had waived 
his right to appellate counsel “based on [his] collective 
behavior with [his] five previous counsel. ” 
  T his court has long held that a defendant’s waiver of 
the right to counsel must be voluntarily, knowingly , and 
intelligently made.  See  State v. Tarumoto, 62 Haw. 298, 300 , 
614 P.2d 397, 399 (1980).  “[A]lthough a waiver must be knowing 
and intentional, it ‘may be expressed or implied, ’ meaning ‘it 
may be established by express statement or agreement, or by acts 
and conduct from which an intention to waive may be reasonably 
inferred.’”  In re Contested Case Hearing on Water Use Permit 
Application Originally Filed by Kukui (Molokai), Inc., 143 
Hawaii 434, 441, 431 P.3d 807, 814 (2018), (quoting Coon v. City 
& Cty. of Honolulu, 98 Hawai i 233, 261, 47 P.3d 348, 376 
(2002)).  With regard to a waiver of the right to counsel by 
conduct, a “[w]aiver may  be shown by conduct of an unequivocal 
nature.”  Tarumoto, 62 Haw. at 300, 614 P.2d at 399. 
  In State v. Char, the ICA considered the circumstances 
under which a defendant may waive the right to counsel by 
repeatedly rejecting court-appointed representation.  80 Hawaii 
262, 264, 909 P.2d 590, 592 (App. 1995).  Upon granting the 
defendant’s  fourth request for substitute counsel, the trial ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
15 court cautioned the defendant that this would be his last court-
appointed attorney.  Id. at 265, 909 P.2d at 593.  Subsequently, 
the defendant again requested substitute counsel, prompting the 
court to grant counsel’s motion to withdraw and determine that 
the defendant had waived his right to counsel.  Id.  The 
defendant represented himself at trial and, following his 
conviction, appealed to the ICA, arguing that his right to 
court-appointed counsel had been violated.  Id. at 264-66, 909 
P.2d at 592-94. 
  The ICA held that to determine whether a defendant had 
validly waived his right to counsel by conduct, six-factors had 
to be satisfied:  
(1) the defendant requested a substitute court -appointed 
counsel; (2) the defendant was afforded a reasonable 
opportunity to show good cause for a substitute court -
appointed counsel; (3) the trial court did not abuse its 
discretion when it decided that a substitute court -
appointed counsel was not warranted; (4) the requirements 
of State v. Dickson ,
 4 Haw. App. 614, 619 –20, 673 P.2d 
1036, 1041 (1983) [], were satisfied; (5)
 the defendant was 
given a clear choice of either continuing with present 
counsel or being deemed to have waived by conduct his or 
her right to counsel; and (6) the defendant refused to 
continue with present counsel.  16
Id. at 268-69, 909 P.2d at 596-97 (internal references omitted).  
The ICA concluded in Char that the lower court ’s failure to give 
                     
 16 “Dickson set forth three areas of ‘specific waiver inquiry’ 
factors to assist trial courts: (1) the particular facts and circumstances 
relating to the defendant that indicate the defendant’s level of 
comprehension; (2) the defendant’s awareness o f the risks of self -
representation; and (3) the defendant’s awareness of the disadvantages of 
self-representation.”  State v. Phua, 135 Hawai i 504, 512, 353 P.3d 1046, 
1054 (2015).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
16 the defendant a reasonable opportunity to show good cause for a 
substitute court-appointed counsel was sufficient to find that 
the defendant had not validly waived his right to counsel 
through his conduct.   Id.  The ICA thus vacated the defendant’s 
conviction and ordered a new trial
.  Id. at 269, 909 P.2d at 
597.   17
  Factor (5) of the Char  framework requires that the 
court give the defendant a “clear choice” of either (1) 
continuing with present counsel or (2) being deemed to have 
waived the right to counsel by conduct.  In this case, the trial 
court allowed Kagiwada to withdraw as appellate counsel before  
addressing Grindling about what “he was going to do about a 
lawyer,” ultimately concluding that Grindling wanted to 
represent himself and that he had waived counsel by his 
“collective behavior with [his] five previous counsel.”  Because 
the trial court allowed Kagiwada to withdraw as counsel before 
addressing Grindling, he was not given 
a “clear choice ”  between 
continuing with his present counsel or being deemed to have 
waived by conduct his right to counsel as required by factor (5) 
of the Char framework.   
                     
 17 Because the ICA concluded that factor (2) had not been met, the 
ICA did not discuss factors (3) through (6).  See Char, 80 Hawaii at 269, 909 
P.2d at 597.   We do not address whether satisfaction of the six factors 
identified by the ICA would necessarily result in a valid waiver of counsel.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
17   Further, the record does not establish that Grindling 
unequivocally waived his right to counsel.  During Grin dling’s 
interaction with the trial  court on remand, Grindling expressly 
stated that he still wanted a lawyer but that he had no choice 
but to represent himself.  He agreed that it was a bad idea to 
represent himself but that he was “forced into it.”   When asked 
to clarify whether he wanted to represent himself, Grindling 
again stated that he “ ha[d] no choice .”    
  Grindling’s conduct did not constitute  a valid waiver 
of his right to appellate counsel, and he was thus denied his 
right to counsel on appeal. 
 Grindling therefore could not 
“knowingly and understandably fail[] to raise” the circuit 
court’s failure to engage him in the required Murray colloquy  
or the claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel on 
 direct appeal.   
  1918
                     
 18 As discussed infra, Section III.D, this court held in Murray that 
“the trial court must conduct a colloquy [with the defendant] regarding 
waiver of proof of an element of the offense.”  State v. Murray, 116 Hawai i 
3, 12, 169 P.3d 955, 964 (2007). 
 19 Grindling is therefore also not judicially estopped from claiming 
ineffective assistance of appellate counsel because of the flawed nature of 
the purported waiver of counsel .  The State alternatively argues that the 
supplemental claims are waived because Grindling could have raised them in 
the 2015 Petition. HRPP Rule 40(a)(3) states that claims may be waived if 
they are not brought “in a prior proceeding actually initiated under this 
rule.”  (Emphasis added.)  The filing of the Petition predated the filing of 
the 2015 Petition.  Ther efore, Grindling’s failure to include the 
supplemental claims in the 2015 Petition d
id not constitute a waiver under 
HRRP Rule 40(a)(3). ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
18 B. The Merits of Grindling’s Ineffective Assistance of Trial 
Counsel Claim. 
  T he circuit court concluded that Grindling was denied 
his constitutional right to the effective assistance of trial 
counsel when his counsel did not request an on- the-record 
colloquy by the trial court and did not object to the trial 
court’s failure to conduct a colloquy before the stipulation to 
elements of the charged offenses was accepted .  In addressing 
the State’s challenge to this ruling, the ICA concluded that it 
did not appear that Songstad had an opportunity to address 
Grindling’s  claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at the 
hearing on the Petition and remanded the case to the circuit 
court to afford such an opportunity.  
  T o demonstrate that trial counsel is constitutionally 
ineffective, a defendant must demonstrate “ 1) that there were 
specific errors or omissions reflecting counsel’ s lack of skill, 
judgment, or diligence; and 2) that such errors or omissions 
resulted in either the withdrawal or substantial impairment of a 
potentially meritorious defense. ”  State v. Silva, 75 Hawai‘i 
419, 440, 864 P.2d 583, 593 (1993) (quoting State v. Aplaca, 74 
Haw. 54, 66-67, 837 P.2d 1298, 1305 (1993)).  Thus, to succeed 
on the claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, 
Grindling is initially required to show that Songstad ’s failure 
to bring the colloquy requirement to the trial court’s attention ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
19 was an omission reflecting a lack of skill, judgment, or 
diligence. 
  Our precedents make clear, however, that it is the 
duty of the trial court to conduct a colloquy to ensure a 
defendant’s waiver of a fundamental right is undertaken 
knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily--and not that of 
defense counsel.  I n State v. Murray--which set forth the 
mandatory colloquy requirement to a defendant’s stipulation to 
an element of a charged offense--we stated  that 
a knowing and voluntary waiver of a defendant’s fundamental 
right must come directly from the defendant, and requires 
the court to engage in a colloquy with the defendant. . . .  
. . . . 
Tachibana  determined that the trial court must engage in an 
on-the-record colloquy  to ensure that the defendant 
knowingly and voluntarily waived his constitutional right . 
. . .  
116 Hawai‘ i 3, 11, 169 P.3d 955, 963 (2007) (emphases added) 
(citing State v. Ibuos, 75 Hawai ‘i 118, 121, 857 P.2d 576, 578 
(1993); Tachibana v. State
, 79 Hawai‘i 226, 235, 900 P.2d 1293, 
1302 (1995)).  Similarly, in State v. Ui, we noted that “it is 
necessary for a trial court to engage a defendant in an on-the -
record colloquy before accepting a waiver of any of the rights 
we have held to be fundamental.”  142 Hawai‘i 287, 293, 418 P.3d 
628, 634 (2018). 
  T he failure of defense counsel to realize that a  court 
neglected to fulfill its constitutional duty to conduct a ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
20 colloquy as to a stipulation to an element of a charged offense, 
or to take action to correct the court’s oversight , or to 
request a colloquy as a matter of due course  are not omissions  
reflecting counsel’s lack of skill, judgment, or diligence.  We 
thus need not consider whether  any such omission by the defense 
counsel would result in the withdrawal or substantial impairment 
of a potentially meritorious defense .   
  
In sum, a trial  court’s constitutional duty to engage 
the defendant in a colloquy prior to accepting a stipulation to 
an element of a charged offense does not devolve upon defense 
counsel when the court does not fulfill its responsibility.20  
Accordingly, Grindling’s claim for relief based on the 
ineffectiveness of trial counsel is without merit.  Thus, the 
ICA erred in remanding the case to the circuit court to allow 
Songstad an opportunity to address Grindling’s claim of 
ineffective assistance of trial counsel.21   
                     
 20 Nevertheless, a prosecutor or defense counsel may certainly 
assist the court by reminding it of the required colloquy or pointing out an 
omission when it occurs.  
 21 The ICA’s SDO also instructed the circuit court to allow Kagiwada 
the opportunity to address Grindling’s claim of ineffective assistance of 
appellate counsel with regard to the failure to raise the tria l court’s error 
on appeal.  As discussed infra, the circuit court correctly concluded that 
the trial court’s failure to engage in a colloquy with Grindling was plain 
error and ordered that Grindling receive a new trial.   Because a new trial 
renders moot Grindling’s  ineffective assistance of appellate counsel  claim, 
which was based on an 
appeal of the original trial  court decision, we need 
not address the merits of Grindling’s ineffective assistance of appellate 
counsel claim or the ICA’s disposition thereof.   See State v. Cordeiro , 99 
Hawai‘i 390, 428, 56 P.3d 692, 730 (2002) (noting that “a decision on other

21 C. The Availability of Plain Error on Collateral Review.  
 
 The ICA held that the HRPP Rule 52(b) plain error 
standard is unavailable on collateral review, citing United 
States v. Frady, 456 U.S. 152, 164-66 (1982).   In Frady, the 
U.S. Supreme Court considered the application of the Federal 
Rules of Criminal Procedure (FRCP) Rule 52(b)-- which authorizes 
federal courts to notice plain error in criminal proceedings-- in 
a collateral review proceeding authorized by a federal statute, 
28 U.S.C. § 2255.  456 U.S. at 163- 64.  The section  2255 
proceeding was not directly governed by the FRCP, but rather by 
the section 2255 Rules, a set of federal procedural rules 
promulgated for th
at specific purpose.  See  id. at 166 n.15.  
The Court reasoned that FRCP Rule 52(b) plain error review was 
not available in a section 2255 proceeding because under its 
precedents there existed a “well -settled principle that to 
obtain collateral relief a prisoner must clear a significantly 22
                                                                        
(. . . continued) 
 
issues in the appellate court may effectively moot an ineffective assistance 
claim” (quoting State v. Silva, 75 Haw. 419, 438, 864 P.2d 583, 592 (1993))).  
We accordingly vacate the portion of the circuit court’s Order Granting 
Petition as to Grindling’s ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim .   
 22 The circuit court vacated the conviction both on grounds of 
ineffective assistance of counsel and plain error.  We therefore consider 
whether the court’s ruling may be affirmed based upon its alternative plain 
error ruling.   State v. Pacquing, 139 Hawai i 302, 313 n.19, 389 P.3d 897, 908 
n.19 (2016) (“[W]here the decision below is correct it must be affirmed by 
the appellate court even though the lower tribunal gave the wrong reason for 
its action.”  (quoting State v. Taniguchi, 72 Haw. 235, 239, 815 P.2d 24, 26 
(1991)).   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
22 higher hurdle than would exist on direct appeal.”  Id. at 166.  
Instead, a petitioner was required to meet the “cause and actual 
prejudice” standard to obtain relief in a section 2255 
proceeding based on an unobjected- to error, which requires a 
showing of “both (1) ‘cause’ excusing [the] double procedural 
default, and (2) ‘actual prejudice’ resulting from the errors of 
which he [or she] complains.”  Id. at 167. 
  Relying on Frady , the ICA in this case held that the 
supplemental claims should be governed exclusively by the 
standards for ineffective assistance of trial and appellate 
counsel and not the HRPP Rule 52(b) plain error standard.   This 
analysis is flawed for several reasons.   23
  First, unlike in Frady , the collateral review in this 
case was not authorized by a statute but instead by HRPP Rule 
40.  This court has not promulgated a separate set of procedural 
rules for post-conviction proceedings analogous to the section 
2255 Rules, and it is self-evident that the HRPP--including HRPP 
Rule 52(b)--apply in a HRPP Rule 40 proceeding. 
  Second, the Court’s decision in Frady was predicated 
on the “cause and actual prejudice” standard of review being a 
                     
 23 HRPP Rule 52(b) provides as follows:  
Plain Error.  Plain errors or defects affecting substantial 
rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the 
attention of the court.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
23 “significantly higher hurdle than” the plain error standard of 
review.  Frady, 457 U.S. at 166.  In contrast, the legal 
standard for identifying ineffective assistance of counsel is 
not a higher standard of review than plain error--indeed, it is 
not a standard of review at all.  Rather, the test for 
ineffective assistance is applied in the first instance by a 
reviewing court.  A court considering whether ineffective 
assistance occurred does not consider the rulings or actions of 
the trial court but rather the conduct of counsel .  And, to the 
extent the two standards are comparable, plain error represents 
the “higher hurdle” because it requires a proponent to 
demonstrate an impairm ent of “substantial rights.”  HRPP Rule 
52(b).  When evaluating a claim for ineffective assistance, we 
consider “the possible, rather than the probable, effect” of 
counsel’s error and “no showing of ‘ actual
’ prejudice is 
required.”  Wilton v. State, 116 Hawai ‘i 106, 119, 170 P.3d 357, 
370 (2007) (quoting Briones  v. State, 74 Haw. 442, 464, 848 P.2d 
966, 977 (1993) ).  Thus, the central logic underlying the United 
States Supreme Court’s holding in Frady is inapplicable to the 
ineffective assistance standard. 
  Lastly , this court has implicitly rejected Frady 
repeatedly in the years since it was decided, by considering--
and in some instances applying--the plain error standard in the 
context of collateral review.  See, e.g., Raines v. State, 79 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
24 Hawai‘i 219, 224 -25, 900 P.2d 1286, 1291- 92 (1995) (applying 
plain error in a post-conviction proceeding based on incorrect 
jury instruction); Dan v. State , 76 Hawai‘i 423, 429, 879 P.2d 
528, 534 (1994) (considering the merits of defendant’s plain 
error argument in a post-conviction proceeding); Briones, 74 
Haw. at 460, 467 n.18, 848 P.2d at 975, 978 n.18 (noting the 
availability of post- conviction plain error review when an error 
on appeal does not satisfy the standard for  ineffective 
assistance of appellate counsel).  The ICA therefore erred in 
concluding that plain error was not the proper standard of 
review.   
D. The Circuit Court ’s Plain Error Conclusion Was Correct . 
  We now turn to whether the circuit court’s application 
of plain error in this case was proper.  The relevant inquiry in 
determining whether a lower court’s plain error may be noticed 
is whether the error affected substantial rights.  State v. 
Hernandez, 143 Hawai i 501, 512, 431 P.3d 1274, 1285 (2018).  As 
this court made clear in State v. Murray , “[t]he defendant’s 
right to have each element of an offense proven beyond a 
reasonable doubt is a constitutionally and statutorily protected 
right.”  116 Hawaii 3, 10, 169 P.3d 955, 962 (2007) (internal 
references omitted).  A knowing and voluntary waiver of such a 
right must come from the defendant and requires the court to ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
25 engage in a colloquy with the defendant.  Id. at 11, 169 P.3d at 
963.  “[A] reviewing court has discretion to correct plain error 
when the error is ‘not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt .’” 
State v. Ui, 142 Hawai i 287, 297, 418 P.3d 628, 638 (2018) 
(quoting State v. Nichols, 111 Hawai i 327, 335, 141 P.3d 974, 
982 (2006)). 
  Grindling was charged with p romoting a dangerous drug 
in the third degree in violation of HRS § 712- 1243(1) and 
prohibited acts related to drug paraphernalia in violation of 
HRS § 329-43.5(a).  At trial, the court accepted the stipulation 
establishing the chain of custody of several packets and a pipe 
received into evidence and the results of chemical testing of 
the evidence, which found the presence of methamphetamine.  As 
the circuit court correctly found, the stipulation “established 
proof of an element to the offenses charged, i.e. the presence 
of methamphetamine.”  The trial court thus erred by not first 
conducting an on-the-record colloquy with Grindling to obtain a 
waiver of his right to have each element of the offenses against 
him proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  See  Murray, 116 Hawaii at 
14, 169 P.3d at 966 (holding that the family court committed 
plain error when it, inter alia, accepted a stipulation without 
engaging the defendant in a colloquy regarding waiving proof of 
an element of the charge).  Without the results confirming the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
26 presence of methamphetamine in this case, the jury could not 
have found Grindling guilty of the charged crimes and the trial 
court’s error was therefore not harmless.  See Ui, 142 Hawai i at 
298, 418 P.3d at 639 (holding that the “e rroneously admitted 
stipulation formed the only basis from which a trier of fact 
could infer ” the defendant ’s specific blood alcohol content 
exceeded the legal limit in a prosecution for operating a 
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant and concluding that 
the district court’s plain error was not harmless).  
  The  circuit court correctly concluded  that the trial 
court’s failure to conduct an on -the-record colloquy with 
Grindling before accepting the stipulation establishing an 
element of the charged offenses was plain error.  Ui, 142 Hawai i 
at 298, 418 P.3d at 639; Murray, 116 Hawaii at 14, 169 P.3d at 
966.  We thus affirm the circuit court’s Order Granting Petition 
on plain error grounds.  24
IV. CONCLUSION  
  Based on the foregoing, we vacate the ICA’s May 2, 
2018 Judgment on Appeal, vacate that portion of the circuit 
court’s Order Granting Petition as to ineffective assistance of 
                     
 24 The State requests that this court review the circuit court’s 
orders compelling discovery related to Grindling’s Petition.  The State does 
not allege any actual consequences of the discovery order in relation to this 
case.  Rather, the State asks only that this court “provide guidance,” 
essentially requesting an advisory opinion.  We decline to do so.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
