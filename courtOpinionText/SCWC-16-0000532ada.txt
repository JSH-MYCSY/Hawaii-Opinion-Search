 eighth Hawaiʻi Rules of Penal Procedure (“HRPP”) Rule 40 (2006) 
petition for post -conviction  relief.   
 Rapozo was convicted of murder by a jury on April 10, 1979.  
On May 16, 1979, the trial court sentenced Rapozo to life 
imprisonment with the possibility of parole a nd ordered 
restitution “in the amount of $11,109.33, the manner of payment 
to be determined and handled by the Department of Social 
Services and Housing .”  In an October 18, 1979 “Notice and Order 
Fixing Minimum Term(s) of Imprisonment, ” the Hawaiʻi Paroling 
Authority (“HPA”) set Rapozo’s minimum sentence at thirty years, 
with the condition  that “[p]arole shall not be granted until 
judg[]ment of restitution is satisfied” (“minimum term order”).   
The HPA denied Rapozo’s parole requests from 2006 through 201 3 
on the grounds  it was not convinced Rapozo could substantially 
comply with the terms and conditions of parole, without stating 
why it was not convinced, and recommended that Rapozo 
participate in various programs . 
 Liberally constru ed,2 in summary, Rapozo argued in his 
eighth HRPP Rule 40 petition  that (1) the trial court erred by 
ordering restitution without first determining whether Rapozo 
could afford to pay it;  (2) the trial court erred by delegating 
                                                           
2  See Villaver v. Sylva , 145 Hawaiʻi 29, 36, 445 P.3d 701, 708 (2019) (“ A 
fundamental tenet of Hawaiʻi law is that pleadings prepared by pro se 
litigants should be interpreted liberally” (cleaned up)).   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER ***  
 
3 
 payment of restitution to the Department of Social S ervices and 
Housing (“DSSH”) ; and (3) the HPA erred by denying him parole 
for nonpayment of restitution .  The circuit court denied the 
eighth HRPP Rule 40 petition without a hearing on June 21, 2016.  
 The Intermediate Court of Appeals (“ICA”)  affirmed.  The 
ICA declined to address Rapozo’s argument on appeal that the 
trial court erred by ordering restitution without determining 
Rapozo’s ability  to pay on the grounds  Rapozo had not raise d the 
issue before the trial court in the eighth HRPP Rule 40 
petition.   The ICA also ruled that State v. Johnson , 68 Haw. 
292, 297, 711 P.2d 1295, 1299 (1985) , which held that “[w]ithout 
express legislative authority, the court cannot delegate the 
sentencing function to another person or entity ,” did not 
retroactively appl y to Rapozo’s sentence.    
 In summary,  we hold that Rapozo stated a colorable claim 
that the HPA denied parole due to nonpayment of restitution due 
to the condition in the minimum term order.  We also hold that 
Johnson clarified an existing legal principle, and therefore did 
not create a “new rule .”  Thus, Rapozo raised colorable  claims 
in his eighth HRPP Rule 40 petition.  
 Hence, we vacate the ICA’s April 5, 2021 judgment on appeal 
and the circuit court’s June 21, 2016 order denying the eighth 
HRPP Rule 40 p etition, and we remand this case to the circuit 
court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER ***

 II. Background  
A. Factual background  
 The ICA opinion on Rapozo’s direct appeal sets out the 
factual background of the murder conviction:  
On the eve ning of August 15, 1978, appellant  [Rapozo]  
was at the Waimanalo Gym.  He purchased a pistol outside 
the Gym and tucked it in his pants.  He consumed some beer 
during the course of the evening.  A girls’ volleyball game 
was in progress in the Gym and appel lant had been in the 
Gym playing with the girls for about an hour when he 
allegedly became obnoxious and was asked to leave.  As he 
walked away, he was confronted by one Robert Lee, whom he 
had never met.  Lee was fatally wounded by the first bullet 
fired from appellant’s gun which struck him in the stomach.  
After Lee had fallen, the appellant shot him two more 
times.  On the question of whether the appellant drew his 
gun and shot Lee the first time or whether the first shot 
resulted from Lee’s attempt to seize the gun and the 
resulting struggle, the evidence was conflicting.  
 
State v. Rapozo  (Rapozo I ), 1 Haw. App. 255, 25 7, 617 P.2d 1235, 
1236 (1980).  
 1. Indictment and sentence  
 On August 23, 1978, a grand jury indicted Rapozo for murder 
in violation of Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (“HRS”)  § 707-701.3  On 
April 10, 1979, a jury convicted Rapozo of the charged offense.   
 On May 16, 1979, the trial court filed its judgment 
sentencing Rapozo to life imprisonment with the possibility of 
                                                           
3  HRS § 707 -701 (1976) provided:  
 
§ 707-701 Murder.  (1) Except as provided in sectio n 
707-702, a person commits the offense of murder if [the 
person] intentionally or knowingly causes the death of 
another person.  
(2) Murder is a class A felony for which the 
defendant shall be sentenced to imprisonment as provided in 
section 706 -606.

 parole.  The trial court also ordered “restitution in the amount 
of $11,109.33, the manner of payment to be determined and 
handled by the Department of Social Services and Housing.”  
 The HPA’s October 18, 1979 minimum term order set Rapozo’s 
minimum sentence at thirty years, with the condition  that 
“[p]arole shall not be granted until judg[]ment of restitution 
is satisfied .”4  (Emphasis added. )   
B. Procedural background  
 Because HRPP Rule 40(a)(3)5 prohibits relief when “the 
issues sought to be raised have been previously ruled upon or 
were waived,” we summarize Rapozo’s previous appeals and 
                                                           
4  At the time of sentencing, HRS § 706 -669 (1976) stated in relevant 
part: 
(1) When a person has been sentenced to an 
indeterminate or an extended term of imprisonment, the 
Hawaii paroling authority shall, as soon as practicable but 
no later than six months a fter commitment to the custody of 
the director of the department of social services and 
housing hold a hearing, and on the basis of the hearing 
make an order fixing the minimum term of imprisonment to be 
served before the prisoner shall become eligible for  
parole. 
5  HRPP Rule 40(a)(3), which governs waiver of issues in HRPP Rule 40 
proceedings, states:  
 
(3) Inapplicability .  Rule 40 proceedings shall not be 
available and relief thereunder shall not be granted where 
the issues sought to be raised have been previously ruled 
upon or were waived.  Except for a claim of illegal 
sentence, an issue is waived if the petitioner knowingly 
and understandingly failed to raise it and it could have 
been raised before the trial, at the trial, on appeal, in a 
habeas corpus  proceeding or any other proceeding actually 
conducted, or in a prior proceeding actually initiated 
under this rule, and the petitioner is unable to prove the 
existence of extraordinary circumstances to justify the 
petitioner’s failure to raise the issue.  There is a 
rebuttable presumption that a failure to appeal a ruling or 
to raise an issue is a knowing and understanding failure.

6 
 petitions.   We also summarize relevant proceedings before the 
HPA. 
1. Rapozo’s direct appeal, previous petitions, and parole 
hearings  
 
a. Direct appeal  
 Rapozo appealed  from the original judgment  of conviction to 
the ICA, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel .6  Rapozo I , 
1 Haw. App. at 25 7, 617 P.2d at 12 36–37.  The ICA affirmed 
Rapozo’s conviction, holding the record insufficient to 
establish ineffective assistance of counsel.  Id.   
  b. First HRPP Rule 40 petition  
 On May 8, 1981, Rapozo filed his first HRPP Rule 40 
petition, S.P. No. 5490 , again alleging ineffective assistance 
of counsel .7  The circuit court denied the petition.  On appeal, 
this court affirmed , concluding Rapozo’s ineffect ive assistance 
of counsel claim was meritless .  Rapozo v. State , No. 8573 (Haw. 
June 26, 1984) (mem.).  
 
 
                                                           
6  Specifically, Rapozo argued trial counsel should have made the defense 
of intoxication as precluding the state of mind req uired for murder the main 
thrust of the defense, rather than the defense of accident.  Rapozo I , 1 Haw. 
App. at 25 7, 617 P.2d at 1237.  
 
7  Rapozo again argued ineffective assistance of counsel, contending (1) 
trial counsel did not adequately investigate his  claim of intoxication and 
resulting diminished capacity, and thus failed to present that defense and 
improperly urged the defense of unintentional or accidental homicide, and (2) 
trial counsel coached him to give perjured testimony.   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER ***  
 
7 
   c. First habeas corpus petition  
 On June 3, 1988, Rapozo filed a habeas corpus petition in 
the United States District Court for the District of Hawaiʻi 
(“district court”)  once again alleging ineffective assistance  of 
counsel.8  The district court dismissed the petition on December 
18, 1991.  
  d. Second HRPP Rule 40 petition  
 On August 13, 1993, Rapozo filed his second  HRPP Rule 40 
petition, S.P.P. No. 93-0048, alleging different grounds  for 
relief.9  The circuit court denied the petition without a hearing  
and Rapozo did not appeal.  
  e. Reduction of Rapozo’s minimum term sentence  
 On August 21, 1995, the HPA granted Rapozo’s application to 
reduce his mi nimum term sentence from thirty years to twenty -
eight years.   His minimum term sentence therefore expired on 
August 10, 2006.  
 
                                                           
8  Rapozo argued (1 ) ineffective assistance from both trial and appellate 
counsel because they failed to fully investigate a possible intoxication 
defense, (2) trial counsel counseled Rapozo on what to testify to at trial, 
thus causing Rapozo to commit perjury and neglect th e intoxication issue, and 
(3) the trial court judge was biased against him because the same judge had 
convicted his brother of murdering a witness .  See State v. Rapozo , No, 88-
0414DAE (D. Haw. Nov. 1, 1991 ) (report and recommendation) . 
 
9  Rapozo argued ( 1) the trial judge was biased against him, (2) the trial 
judge had a conflict of interest and therefore neglected to instruct for 
negligent homicide, (3) the police were negligent in their investigation, and 
(4) his trial counsel was rewarded for his conviction with a position as a 
judge.

 (continued.  . .)   f. Third HRPP Rule 40 petition  
 On July 11, 1997, Rapozo filed his third  HRPP Rule 40 
petition, S.P.P. No. 97 -0016, alleging ine ffective assistance  of 
counsel and several other grounds for relief .10  The circuit 
court denied the petition .  On appeal, the ICA summarily 
affirmed.  Rapozo v. State , 90 Hawaiʻi 502, 979 P.2d 98 ( SDO) 
(App. Jan. 27, 1999). 
  g. HRPP Rule 35 motion to corr ect sentence  
 On January 12, 1999, Rapozo filed a “Brief in Support of 
Motion to Correct Sentence” (“HRPP Rule 35 motion”).11  The 
circuit court summarily denied the HRPP Rule 35 motion without a 
hearing.12  This court dismissed Rapozo’s  appeal after he failed 
                                                           
10  Rapozo argued (1) ineffective assistance of trial counsel because 
counsel failed to object and move for an in  camera hearing, (2) the State 
misled the jury by withholding material evidence, and (3) he was denied the 
right to confront potential witnesses/statements.  
 
11  Rapozo argued that HRS § 707 -701 had been amended since the time of his 
sentence, and the crime of which he was convicted did not fall within the 
scope of the then -current version of HRS § 707 -701 (1993),  first degree 
murder.  He also argued his sentence should be corrected to reflect the term 
of imprisonment imposed by HRS § 706 -656 (1993), the statute then governing 
the penalty for second degree murder, HRS § 707 -701.5 (1993).   
 
12  The circuit court r ejected the motion because (1) it was untimely under 
HRPP Rule 35, and (2) HRS § 707 -701.5 could not be retroactively applied .  As 
to the second basis, the circuit court, noting that HRS § 707 -701 was amended 
and HRS § 707 -701.5 (second degree murder) was add ed by 1986 Haw. Sess. Laws 
Act 314, § 50 at 616, stated:  
 
In essence, Rapozo asks this court to correct his 
sentence to reflect the sentence of an offense (Murder in 
the Second Degree) that did not exist at the time Rapozo 
was indicted, convicted and sente nced.  Rapozo’s request 
presents the issue of whether this court can retroactively 
apply HRS § 707 -701.5 (1993), which took effect on January 
1, 1987, to correct Rapozo’s sentence, which was imposed on 
May 16, 1979.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER ***

 to file an opening brief.  See State v. Rapozo , No. 22327 (Haw. 
Sept. 9, 1999) (order).   
  h. Fourth HRPP Rule 40 petition  
 On January 5, 2006, Rapozo filed a request for “Revocation 
of Restitution Forms,” which did not contain any arguments.  The 
circuit court construed the request as a non -conforming petition 
for post -conviction relief under HRPP Rule 40(c)(2)13 and filed 
the request under S.P.P. No. 06 -1-0040.  Because Rapozo did not 
                                                                  
(. . .continued) 
HRS § 1-3 (1993) states that “[n ]o law has any 
retrospective operation, unless otherwise expressed or 
obviously intended.”  The general rule is that “[s ]tatutes 
or regulations which say nothing about retroactive 
application are not applied retroactively if such a 
construction will impair existin g rights, create new 
obligations or impose additional duties with respect to 
past transactions.”  Clark v. Cassidy , 64 Haw. 74, 77, n.6, 
636 P.2d 1344, 1346, n.6 (1981).  Because Act 314 took 
effect on January 1, 1987 and because HRS § 707 -701.5 
(1993) doe s not mention retroactive application, this court 
cannot correct Rapozo’s sentence to conform with the 
provisions of HRS § 707 -656 (1993), the sentence required 
by HRS § 707 -701.5 (1993).  
On May 16, 1979, Rapozo was sentenced to life 
imprisonment with the possibility of parole.  This sentence 
was correct according to the law as it existed at that 
time. 
 
(Alterations in original.)   
13  HRPP Rule 40(c)(2) states:  
 
(c)  Form and Content of Petition.  
 
 . . . . 
 
(2)  Nonconforming Petition .  Where a post -conviction 
petition deviates from the form annexed to these 
rules, it shall nevertheless be accepted for filing 
and shall be treated as a petition under this rule 
provided that the petition (i) claims illegality of a 
judgment or illegality of “custody” or “restra int” 
arising out of a judgment, (ii) is accompanied by the 
necessary filing fee or by a well -founded request to 
proceed without paying filing fees, and (iii) meets 
minimum standards of legibility and regularity.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER ***  
 
10 
 supplement the non -conforming petition as required , the circuit 
court dismissed the petition.    
  i. 2006 parole hearing  
 On October 23, 2006, the HPA denied Rapozo’s parole request 
on the grounds  it was “not convinced  that [Rapozo] could 
substantially comply with the terms and conditions of parole .”  
The HPA recommended “[t]hat [Rapozo] participate in work 
furlough. ”  A rehearing was scheduled for July 2007.  
  j. 2007 parole hearing  
 On July 24, 2007, the HPA again denied Rapozo’s parole 
request on the grounds  it was “not convinced that [Rapozo] could 
substantially comply  with the terms and conditions of parole. ”  
The HPA recommended “[t]hat [Rapozo] participate in all RAD 
recommended programs.”14  A rehearing was scheduled for June 
2008. 
  k. Fifth HRPP Rule 40 petition  
 On January 24, 2008, Rapozo filed his fifth  HRPP Rul e 40 
petition, S.P.P. No. 08 -1-0003, raising various grounds  for 
relief.15  The circuit court denied the petition without a 
                                                           
14  The record does not reflect what the acro nym RAD means.  However, 
according to Rapozo, “RAD” means “Reception Assessment & Diagnostics.”  
 
15  Rapozo argued (1) his First Amendment rights were violated by 
application of ex post facto laws, (2) the HPA and Department of Public 
Safety (“DPS”) refused  to release him after the expiration of what should 
have been his maximum term sentence, (3) he was falsely imprisoned, and (4) 
ex post facto law changes “were applied without notification of change or 
application.”  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER ***  
 
11 
 hearing, and Rapozo appealed.  The ICA affirmed , holding that 
Rapozo was properly sentenced  to life imprisonment with the 
possibility  of parole  and he was not being held beyond the 
expiration of his maximum sentence .  Rapozo v. State , No. 29771, 
2010 WL 2565125, at *1 (App. June 28, 2010) (SDO).  
l. 2008 parole hearing  
 On June 26, 2008, the HPA again denied Rapozo’s parole 
request on the grounds  it was “not convinced  that [Rapozo could ] 
substantially comply with the terms and conditions of paro le.”  
The HPA recommended  “[t]hat [Rapozo] participate in all RAD 
recommended programs.”  A rehearing was scheduled for May 2009.   
  m. 2009 parole  hearing 
 On May 20, 2009, the HPA once again denied Rapozo’s parole 
request on the grounds  it was “not convinced  that [Rapozo could ] 
substantially comply with the terms and conditions of parole. ”  
The HPA recommended “[t]hat Rapozo participate in work 
furlough.”  A rehearing was scheduled for April 2010.  
  n. Sixth HRPP Rule 40 petition  
 On May 26, 2009, Rapozo filed a “Petition for Writ of 
Habeas Corpus” in the circuit court .16  The circuit court treated 
the petition  as a non -conforming petition for post -conviction 
relief and filed it under S.P.P. No. 09 -1-0022.  Rapozo again 
                                                           
16  Rapozo argued he was illegally impris oned because he was sentenced to a 
twenty-year imprisonment and ex post facto law changes were applied.  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER ***  
 
12 
 did not timely supplement the non -conforming petition with the 
required form, and the circuit court dismissed the petition.  
  o. 2010 parole hearing  
 On April 22, 2010 , the HPA denied Rapozo’s  parole request, 
stating: “REASON FOR DENIAL: Your participation in work furlough 
while incarcerated will significantly enhance your success on 
parole.”  A rehearing was scheduled for January 2011.  
  p. Second habeas corpus petition  
 On August 30, 2010, Rapozo filed an “Amended Petition Under 
28 U.S.C. § 2254 for a Writ of Habeas Corpus  by a Person in 
State Custody ” in the district court .17  The district court 
transferred the petition to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals 
on the grounds  only the Nint h Circuit could authorize th e 
district  court to consider a second or successive petition for 
writ of habeas corpus .  The Ninth Circuit then denied 
authorization for a second habeas corpus petition.  
  q. 2011 parole hearing  
 On March 28, 2011, the HPA denie d Rapozo’s parole request 
on the grounds  it was “not convinced  that [Rapozo could ] 
substantially comply with the terms and conditions of parole. ”  
                                                           
17  Rapozo argued (1) erroneous conviction and violation of the Fifth and 
Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution, (2) violation of article 
1, section 10 of the United States Constitution (ex post facto clause), (3) 
cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the 
United States Constitution, and (4) illegal and improper detainment in 
violation of the Fourteenth Amendment  to the United States Constitution.  
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER ***  
 
13 
 The HPA recommended “[t]hat [Rapozo] participate in work 
furlough.”  A rehearing was scheduled for February 2 012. 
  r. Seventh HRPP Rule 40 petition  
 On January 10, 2012, Rapozo filed a n HRPP Rule 40 petition  
that alleged fourteen points of error , initiating S.P.P. No. 12 -
1-0003.18  The circuit court dismissed the petition, finding:  
All fourteen grounds raised by Petitioner were in fact 
already raised and ruled upon either in Petitioner’s direct 
appeal, or in one of his four prior Rule 40 Petitions cited 
above and their respective appeals.[19]  Even assuming, 
arguendo, that any of the fourteen grounds were not raise d 
in Petitioner’s prior Rule 40 Petitions or his direct 
appeal, they are deemed waived as Petitioner has failed to 
allege facts establishing the existence of extraordinary 
circumstances to justify the failure to raise them in the 
earlier proceedings.  
 
The ICA dismissed Rapozo’s  appeal after Rapozo failed to 
file an opening brief.  Rapozo v. State , No. CAAP -12-0000544, 
2013 WL 1490431 (App. Apr. 11, 2013)  (order). 
 
 
                                                           
18  The fourteen points of error were: (1) application of ex post facto 
laws to his sentence; (2) violation of the ex post facto clause ; (3) the 
State did not prove the elements of the charged offense beyond a reasonab le 
doubt; (4) the State used perjured testimony ; (5) vindictive prosecution ; (6) 
error under Chapman v. California , 386 U.S. 18 (1967) ; (7) he was falsely 
charged with charges stemming from a riot at Halawa Correctional Center ; (8) 
trial counsel’s conflict  of interest as he was rewarded for Rapozo’s 
conviction with a position as a judge ; (9) ineffective assistance of 
appellate counsel ; (10) cruel and unusual punishment ; (11) conviction on 
different issues and facts than what he was charged with ; (12) 
“discriminatory enforcement of the law”; (13) he was held in prison because 
he was unable to pay restitution ; and (14) ineffective assistance of trial

 s. 2012 parole hearing  
On August 28, 2012, the HPA again denied Rapozo’s parole 
request on the grounds it was “not convinced  that [Rapozo could ] 
substantially comply with the terms and conditions of parole. ”  
The HPA recommended “[t]hat [Rapozo] participate in all RAD 
recommended programs.”  A rehearing was scheduled for July 2013.  
 t. 2013 parole h earing 
On July 29, 2013 , the HPA denied Rapozo’s parole request , 
stating: “REASON FOR DENIAL: Your participation in work furlough 
while incarcerated will significantly enhance your success on 
parole.”  A rehearing was scheduled for June 2014.  
u. Instant ei ghth HRPP Rule 40 petition  and 
responses  
 
On June 9, 2014,  Rapozo filed “Defendant’s Motion for 
Revocation of Restitution”20 (“motion for revocation of 
restitution”).   The circuit court construed the motion for 
revocation of restitution as a non -conforming petition for post -
conviction relief and initiated S.P.P. No. 14 -1-0016.  On July 
18, 2014, Rapozo filed a “Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or 
Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner from Custody,” which 
incorporated the motion.  The July 18, 2014 petition  is the 
                                                           
20  In a Motion for Assistance of Counsel, Rapozo also requested 
appointment of couns el to represent him on the allegedly colorable claims in 
his Motion for Revocation of Restitution.

 eighth HRPP Rule 40 petition, the subject of this certiorari 
proceeding.  
In his eighth HRPP Rule 40 petition, Rapozo raised the 
following  general claims for relief.  First, based on the 1979 
minimum term order, Rapozo argued the HPA violated his 
constitutional rights by denying him parole due to nonpayment of 
restitution ; he also argued  that his restitution was in any 
event satisfied based on HRS §§ 706 -644 (2014) and 706 -645 
(2014)21 and therefore should be deemed “revoked.”  Second, 
Rapozo argued h is sentence was illegal because ( 1) he was 
sentenced to an extended term of imprisonment when he received 
                                                           
21  HRS § 706 -644 states in relevant part:  
 
(3) The term of imprisonment for nonpayment of fee, fine, 
or restitution shall be specified in the order of 
commitment, and shall not exceed one day for each $25 0 of 
the fee or fine, thirty days if the fee or fine was imposed 
upon conviction of a violation or a petty misdemeanor, or 
one year in any other case, whichever is the shorter 
period.  A person committed for  nonpayment of a fee or fine 
shall be given credit toward payment of the fee or fine for 
each day of imprisonment, at the rate of $25 0 per day.  
 
 At the time Rapozo was sentenced and convicted, HRS § 706 -644 did not 
contain the word “restitution”; the legi slature added the word “restitution” 
to the statute in 1986.  See 1986 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 314, § 36 at 610 -11.  
In 2021, the legislature amended the conversion rate in HRS § 706 -644(3) from 
$25 to $250.  See 2021 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 81, § 4.  
 
 HRS § 706 -645 states in relevant part:  
 
(2) If it appears to the satisfaction of the court that the 
circumstances which warranted the imposition of the fine or 
restitution have changed, or that it would otherwise be 
unjust to require payment, the court may revoke th e fine or 
restitution or the unpaid portion thereof in whole or in 
part.  Prior to revocation, the court shall afford the 
prosecuting attorney an opportunity to be heard.

 life imprisonment  with the possibility of parole instead of a 
twenty-year imprisonment, ( 2) restitution was not an authorized 
sentence for murder unde r HRS §§ 706 -605 (1978) and 706 -606 
(1976),22 and (3) even if restitution was an authorized sentence 
for murder, the trial court could not delegate the determination 
of the manner of payment to  the DSSH, citing to State v. 
Gaylord, 78 Hawaiʻi 127, 890 P.2d 1167 (1995) .23 
                                                           
22  HRS § 706 -605 stated in relevant part:  
 
(l) Except as provided in section 706 -606 and subject to 
the applicable provisions of this Code, the court may 
suspend the imposition of sentence on a person who has been 
convicted of a crime, may order [that person]  to be 
committed in lieu of sentence in accordance with section 
706-607, or may s entence [that person]  as follows:  
 
 . . . . 
 
 (e) To make restitution or reparation to the 
victim or victims of [the] crime in an amount [the 
defendant]  can afford to pay, for loss or damage 
caused thereby in addition to paragraphs (a), (b), 
(c), or (d) ab ove. 
 
 HRS § 706 -606 stated in relevant part:  
  
The court shall sentence a person who has been convicted of 
murder to an indeterminate term of imprisonment.  In such 
cases the court shall impose the maximum length of 
imprisonment as follows:  
  
 . . . . 
 
 (b) Life imprisonment with possibility of 
parole or twenty years as the court determines, in 
all other cases.  The minimum length of imprisonment 
shall be determined by the Hawaii paroling authority 
in accordance with section 706 -669.  
 
23  Rapozo also asse rted that the HPA raised his minimum term sentence to 
thirty years without providing a reason; the record does not evidence this.  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER ***  
 
17 
  Attached to the motion for revocation of restitution were 
several documents, includ ing an April 23, 2014 letter from then -
HPA administrator Tommy Johnson (“Johnson”)  to Rapozo .  In 
relevant part,  the letter stated : 
Secondly,  your assertion that you are being held in 
custody as a result of not being able to pay the 
restitution ordered by the court is without merit and 
bo[]rders on being completely untrue.  There is absolutely 
no evidence to suggest that you were ever denied pa role as 
a result of any issue regarding restitution ordered by the 
court. 
 
. . . . 
 
Finally, it is recommended that you continue to 
participate in facility programs, remain misconduct free, 
and participate in the Work Furlough programs as previously 
recommended.  Your next parole consideration hearing will 
take place during September 2014, as previously ordered by 
the parole board.  
 
In response  to the eight h HRPP Rule 40 petition , the State 
argued HRPP Rule 40(a)(3) precluded the issues raised because 
they were previously ruled upon or waived.24  The State, through 
the Attorney General (“AG”),  argued in relevant part that  (1) 
Rapozo’s claims were waived and/or previously ruled upon, (2) 
Rapozo’s claims that his constitutional rights were being 
violated shoul d be dismissed or transferred because they did not 
allege illegal custody or restraint,  and (3) there was no 
constitutional or statutory right to parole.    
                                                           
24  The State requested and received, over Rapozo’s objection, two 
extensions of time to respond.  Attached to the second Sept ember 15, 2014 
extension motion was a declaration that stated: “Declarant was recently 
informed of a policy change regarding restitution matters, an issue raised in 
the Petition, which could affect the State’s response.”  The State ’s answer  
did not mention  any “policy change regarding restitution matters  . . . .” 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER ***  
 
18 
 (continued.  . .) On April 29, 2016, the AG also filed a declaration from 
Johnson and additional documents in support of its answer to the 
eighth HRPP Rule 40 petition , which included  the HPA’s parole 
denials in 2014, 2015, and 2016.25  Johnson declared  he was the 
HPA administrator from September 17, 2001, to June 12, 2007, 
when he became the Deputy Director of Correction for the DPS 
until December 6, 2010, when he returned to his HPA 
administrator position.  Johnson maintained  that there was no 
evidence the HPA denied Rapozo’s parole requests based on unpaid  
restitution, notwithstanding the language in the 1979 HPA 
minimum term order;  that despite Rapozo’s claim that he was a 
“model prisoner” and had “no misconduct for years,” Rapozo had 
violated various prison rules and policies from 1983 to 2014;  
that Rapozo had not participated in the recommended level II 
substance abuse  treatment program; that the work furlough 
program is full at times  and incarcerated people scheduled to 
participate in it ha ve to wait to be transported back to Hawaiʻi; 
and that the DPS, not the HPA,  controlled when and which inmates 
were transported  from Arizona to Hawai ʻi.26 
                                                           
25  On June 26, 2014 ; March 30, 2015; and February 24, 2016,  the HPA denied 
Rapozo’s parole request s on the grounds it was “not convinced that [Rapozo 
could] substantially comply with the terms and  conditions of parole. ”  The 
HPA recommended “[t]hat [Rapozo] participate in all RAD recommended 
programs.”  
26  Johnson also incorrectly stated that Rapozo was “serving a concurrent 
sentence for a federal offense at a federal prison when his minimum term *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER ***  
 
19 
 (continued.  . .) On June 21, 2016, the circuit court denied the eighth HRPP 
Rule 40 petition  without a hearing.  
The circuit court addressed Rapozo’s argument that the 
trial court could not delegate the determination of the manner 
of payment of restit ution to the DSSH.  The circuit court 
indicated  the premise set forth in Gaylord, that the trial court 
must enter findings of fact and conclusions of law that the 
manner of payment of restitution was reasonable and one the 
defendant could afford, which Rap ozo relied on in his arguments,  
was based on Johnson.  Noting Rapozo’s conviction became final 
on or about November 15, 1980 , the circuit court framed the 
issue as whether Johnson retroactively  applied to Rapozo’s 
sentence.  The circuit court cited  to State v. Gomes, 107 Hawaiʻi 
308, 113 P.3d 184 (2005),  as the “controlling precedent,”  in 
which this court applied the Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288 (1989)  
framework to determine whether a new constitutional rule of 
criminal procedure applied on collateral revie w.27 
                                                                  
(. . .continued) 
expired . . . .”  Rapozo was instead transferred to a federal prison after he 
was involved in a riot at the Halawa Correctional Facility.  
27  In Gomes, this court stated:  
 
In Teague v. Lane , the Supreme Court held that new 
constitutional rules of criminal procedure that had not 
been announced at the time the defendant ’s conviction 
became final cannot be applied retroactively on collateral 
review unless they fit within one of two narrow exceptions.   
These exceptions exist  if a new rule (1) “places certain 
kinds of primary private individual conduct beyond the 
power of the criminal law -making authority to proscribe,” 
or (2) “requires the observance of those procedures that *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER ***  
 
20 
 The circuit court applied the Teague framework  to Rapozo’s 
argument .  The circuit court reasoned that at  the time of 
Rapozo’s conviction, there were no cases interpreting the 
language of HRS § 706 -605(1)(e).  The circuit court observed 
that until Johnson, there were no Hawaiʻi cases that had 
specifically interpreted the phrase “in an amount he can afford 
to pay” to include the manner of payment.  The circuit court 
concluded that , therefore,  Johnson’s prohibition  on delegating 
the manner of payment of restitution was a “new rule” created 
after Rapozo’s conviction.  The circuit court also concluded 
that, because neither of the Teague exceptions applied, Johnson 
did not retroactively apply to Rapozo’s sentence.  
The circuit court also concluded: (1)  Rapozo’s challenges 
to the 2006 through 2011  HPA parole denials were previously 
ruled upon or waived ;28 (2) Rapozo’s argument that he had been 
denied parole due to nonpayment of restitution was meritless, 
patently frivolous, and without a trace of support in the 
                                                                  
(. . .continued) 
. . . are implicit in the concept of ordered libert y.”  
Thus, in order to apply the rule of Apprendi  retroactively, 
we must determine that Apprendi  is a new rule of criminal 
procedure that fits into one of Teague’s  exceptions.  
 
107 Hawaiʻi at 313, 113 P.3d at 189 (ellipsis in original) (quoting United 
States v. Sanchez -Cervantes , 282 F.3d 664, 667 (9th Cir. 2002)).  
28  The circuit court ruled the 2006 and 2007 HPA parole denials were 
previously raised and ruled upon in Rapozo’s 2008 HRPP Rule 40 proceeding; 
and the 2008 through 2011 HPA parole denials were w aived because Rapozo could 
have raised those issues in his 2009 and/or 2012 HRPP Rule 40 petitions but 
failed to do so, and he failed to prove the existence of extraordinary 
circumstances justifying his failure to do so.

 record;29 (3) Rapozo’s arg ument that he  was held in custody since 
2006 for nonpayment of restitution  was meritless, patently 
frivolous, and without a trace of support in the record ;30 (4) 
Rapozo’s challenge to his extended term sentence had been raised 
and ruled upon in his prior HR PP Rule 40 petitions and to the 
extent any portion of that issue was not raised and ruled upon, 
it was meritless, patently frivolous, and without a trace of 
support in the record;  and (5) Rapozo’s claim t hat restitution 
was not an authorized sentence for m urder under HRS §§ 706 -605 
and 706-606 was meritless, patently frivolous, and without a 
trace of support in the record.  
Rapozo appealed from the  circuit court’s order denying  the 
eighth HRPP Rule 40 petition  to the ICA.31 
                                                           
29  The circuit court ruled the HPA denied parole in 2012 and 2014 through 
2016 because  (1) notwithstanding the 1979 HPA minimum term order, it was not 
convinced that Rapozo could substantially comply with the terms and 
conditions of parole ; and (2) the HPA indicated the reason for the 20 13 
parole denial was that participation in work furlough while incarcerated 
would significantly enhance Rapozo’s  success on parole.  
 
30  The circuit court ruled that Rapozo’s reliance on HRS § 706 -644 was 
misplaced because the limitations on imprisonment fo r nonpayment and the 
conversion rate of $25 per day of imprisonment then set out in HRS § 706 -
644(3) plainly applied only to fees and fines.  Further, the circuit court 
stated that even if Rapozo’s default was not contumacious, he had not 
presented any evi dence of a change in circumstances , or that requiring 
payment would be unjust , to revoke restitution.  
 
31  Rapozo had also initiated proceedings that resulted in: Rapozo v. 
State, No. 29047, 2008 WL 923291 (Haw. Mar. 24, 2008) (order); Rapozo v. 
Hawaiʻi, Case 1:08 -cv-00191-HG-BMK (D. Haw. May 2, 2008) (order); Rapozo v. 
Perkins, No. 29667, 2009 WL 714308 (Haw. Mar. 13, 2009) (order); Rapozo v. 
Frank, No. 29718, 2009 WL 990850 (Haw. Apr. 9, 2009) (order); Rapozo v.

 2. ICA proceedings  
 On appeal, Rapo zo raised fourteen points of error .32   
 The ICA rejected Rapozo’s arguments and affirmed the 
circuit court ’s order denying the eighth HRPP Rule 40 petition .  
Rapozo v. State , CAAP-16-0000532, 2021 WL 945376 (App. Mar. 12, 
2021) (mem.).   The ICA ruled that under the Teague framework, 
Johnson could not be retroactively applied, as Johnson had 
announced a new rule —five years after Rapozo’s conviction and 
                                                           
32  The fourteen points of error were : (1) the trial court plainly erred by 
ordering Rapozo to pay restitution without first determining that he could 
afford to pay it, citing to State v. Murray , 63 Haw. 12, 621 P.2d 334 (1980) , 
Johnson, 68 Haw. 292, 711 P.2d 1295 (1985) , and Gaylord, 78 Hawaiʻi 127, 890 
P.2d 1167 (1995) ; (2) the trial court erred by delegating payment of 
restitution to  the DSSH; (3) the trial court erred by failing to address 
Rapozo’s challenges to restitution brought under HRS § 706 -645; (4) the 
circuit court erred by determi ning the “afford to pay” requirement was not 
available to Rapozo in 1979; (5) the HPA erred by disallowing Rapozo’s 
possibility of parole for non -payment of a fee, fine, or restitution; (6) the 
HPA erred by repeatedly denying Rapozo parole because of “RAD 
recommendations,” as the DPS never returned him to Hawaiʻi to complete the 
“Hawaii Program,” which did not exist before his removal from Hawaiʻi; (7) the 
HPA erred by denying Rapozo parole repeatedly for his failure to complete the 
work furlough program when it was only available in Hawaiʻi, and he was never 
returned to Hawaiʻi; (8) the HPA erred by not returning Rapozo to Hawaiʻi to 
participate in the work furlough program for the reasons that “no room” 
existed on approximately forty plane flights to Hawaiʻi or that the program 
was “too full” to accommodate Rap ozo; (9) the circuit court erred by allowing 
the AG to untimely respond to his petition; (10) the circuit court erred by 
not addressing Johnson’s perjury in his sworn affidavit; (11) the trial court 
erred by sentencing Rapozo under HRS § 706 -606(b), which allowed “arbitrary 
selection of multiple punishments without specific differentiating elements 
of legislative instruction depicting separation of higher and lower degrees 
of punishment”; (12) the trial court erred by determining Rapozo’s maximum 
term sente nce, and the HPA erred by determining Rapozo’s minimum term 
sentence, when neither were the trier of fact; (13) the State erred by 
keeping Rapozo away from Hawaiʻi and his family for nearly forty years, 
preventing him from seeing his mother before her deat h, and distanced from 
those who could offer him the most support and assistance in a successful 
community re -entry; and (14) the circuit court erred by denying Rapozo a 
hearing when he alleged federal and state constitutional violations, and by 
failing to address his claims of illegal sentence under HRPP Rule 35 as 
incorporated by HRPP Rule 40.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER ***  
 
23 
 sentence became final —that did not fall within either of the 
Teague exceptions.  Rapozo, mem. op. at 14.  The ICA ruled the 
circuit court therefore did not err by denying Rapozo’s request 
for relief without a hearing.  Id.   
The ICA also ruled Rapozo’s argument that the “ Hawaii 
Paroling Authority,  by Order, has committed error in disallowing 
[Rapozo’s] possibil ity of parole for non -payment of a fee, fine 
or restitution” was meritless and waived.  Rapozo, mem. op. at 
15-16.  The ICA stated that notwithstanding the condition in the 
1979 minimum term order, none of the eleven HPA parole decisions 
in the record refe renced payment of restitution as a condition 
of parole.33  Rapozo, mem. op. at 15.  Moreover, the ICA ruled 
that argument had been waived, as it challenged a n HPA parole 
decision; it did not implicate an illegal  sentence ; it was not 
raised in any of Rapozo’ s previous HRPP Rule 40 petitions; and 
Rapozo failed to show the existence of extraordinary 
circumstances justifying his failure to raise the issue 
previously.  Rapozo, mem. op. at 15 -16.  Thus, the ICA concluded 
the circuit court did not err by denying Ra pozo’s request for 
relief without a hearing.  Rapozo, mem. op. at 16.  
                                                           
33  The ICA stated it could not consider the several documents attached to 
Rapozo’s reply brief, which were not presented to the circuit court with his 
eighth HRPP Ru le 40 petition.  Rapozo, mem. op. at 15 n.9 (citing Hawaiʻi 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (“HRAP”)  Rule 28(b)(10)).  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER ***  
 
24 
 The ICA also ruled the 2010 and 2013 HPA parole denials 
were not based on Rapozo’s failure to participate in the work 
furlough program, but rather, were “consistent with a continuing 
assessment by HPA that Rapozo is unable to ‘substantially comply 
with the terms and conditions of parole[,]’ but that his 
participation in work furlough programs would ‘significantly 
enhance’ his ability to ‘substantially comply with the terms and 
conditions of parole.’”  Rapozo, mem. op. at 17.  
As to Rapozo’s first, third, fourth, sixth , and eighth  
through fourteenth points of error, the ICA concluded they were 
either meritless, waived, or raised for the first time on 
appeal.  See generally  Rapozo, mem. op. a t 12-20. 
3. Supreme court proceedings  
 On April 20, 2021, Rapozo filed a pro se certiorari 
applicatio n, which d oes not contain any arguments or questions 
presented .34 
III. Standards of review  
A. HRPP Rule 40 petitions  
 Review of orders denying HRPP Rule 40 petitions is de 
novo: 
 
                                                           
34  Rapozo also filed an April 20, 2021 single -sentence “Request for 
Appointment of Counsel.”  On May 4, 2021, Rapozo filed a “Motion for 
Appointment of Counsel,” asserting he has the constitutional right to have 
effective assistance of counsel throughout his criminal proceedings, and 
appears to ask for counsel to help him prepare a certiorari application.  As 
Rapozo stated colorable claims as d iscussed below, he must be appointed 
counsel on remand.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER ***  
 
25 
 As a general rule, a hearing should be held on 
a Rule 40 petition for post -conviction relief where 
the petition states a colorable claim.  To establish 
a colorable claim, the allegations of the petition 
must show that if taken as tru e the facts alleged 
would change the verdict, however, a petitioner’s 
conclusions need not be regarded as true.  Where 
examination of the record of the trial court’s 
proceedings indicates that the petitioner’s 
allegations show no colorable claim, it is not  error 
to deny the petition without a hearing.  The question 
on appeal of a denial of a Rule 40 petition without a 
hearing is whether the trial record indicates that 
Petitioner’s application for relief made such a 
showing of a colorable claim as to require  a hearing 
before the lower court.

to final judgment, any person may seek relief under 
the procedure set forth in this rule from the 
judgment of conviction, on the following grounds:  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER ***  
 
26 
 (i) that the judgment was obtained or sentence 
imposed in violation of the constitution of the 
United States or of the State o f Hawaiʻi; 
 
. . . . 
 
(iii) that the sentence is illegal;  
 
. . . . 
 
(v) any ground which is a basis for collateral 
attack on the judgment.  
 
 . . . .  
 
(2) From Custody .  Any person may seek relief 
under the procedure set forth in this rule from 
custody base d upon a judgment of conviction, on the 
following grounds:  
 
  . . . . 
 
(iii) any other ground making the custody, 
though not the judgment, illegal.  
 
 HRPP Rule 40(a)(3)  governs waiver of issues in HRPP Rule 40 
proceeding s, and provides : 
(3) Inapplicability . Rule 40 proceedings shall not be 
available and relief thereunder shall not be granted where 
the issues sought to be raised have been previously ruled 
upon or were waived.  Except for a claim of illegal 
sentence, an issue is waived if the petitioner knowi ngly 
and understandingly failed to raise it and it could have 
been raised before the trial, at the trial, on appeal, in a 
habeas corpus proceeding or any other proceeding actually 
conducted, or in a prior proceeding actually initiated 
under this rule, and the petitioner is unable to prove the 
existence of extraordinary circumstances to justify the 
petitioner’s failure to raise the issue.  There is a 
rebuttable presumption that a failure to appeal a ruling or 
to raise an issue is a knowing and understanding failure.  
 
 HRPP Rule 40(f), which governs hearings on HRPP Rule 40 
petitions, states in relevant part:  
(f) Hearings .  If a petition alleges facts that if 
proven would entitle the petitioner to relief, the court 
shall grant a hearing which may extend only to the issues 
raised in the petition or answer.  However, the court may 
deny a hearing if the petitioner’s claim is patently 
frivolous and is without trace of support either in the 
record or from other evidence submitted by the petitioner.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER ***  
 
27 
 The court may a lso deny a hearing on a specific question of 
fact when a full and fair evidentiary hearing upon that 
question was held during the course of the proceedings 
which led to the judgment or custody which is the subject 
of the petition or at any later proceeding . 
 
 In turn, HRPP Rule 40(i) provides that indigent petitioners 
are entitled to representation  by the public defender  on their 
HRPP Rule 40 petitions if the petition is not “patently 
frivolous and without trace of support  . . . .” 
 In sum, if an indigent p etitioner raises  a “colorable 
claim” in an HRPP Rule 40 petition , they are entitled to 
representation on the petition  in an HRPP Rule 40(f) hearing.   A 
“colorable claim” is one that is not “patently frivolous and 
without trace of support .”  With the forego ing principles in 
mind, we now turn to Rapozo’s arguments.   
B. The circuit court erred by denying the eighth HRPP Rule 40 
petition  without a hearing because Rapozo stated colorable 
claims  
 
1. Rapozo stated a colorable claim that the trial court 
erred by d elegating the determination of the manner of 
payment of restitution to the DSSH  
 
 We first address  Rapozo’s second point of error  that the 
trial court erred by delegating the determination of the manner 
of payment of restitution to the DSSH .  If this claim  does not 
concern an  illegal sentence, HRPP Rule 40(a)(3) bars relief, as 
Rapozo could previously have raised this issue.  
 As the ICA noted, in Johnson, this court held that 
“[w]ithout express legislative authority, the court cannot *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER ***  
 
28 
  
. . . . 
 
(continued.  . .) delegate the sentencing  function to another person or entity.”35  
Johnson, 68 Haw. at 297, 711 P.2d at 1299.   In Johnson, which 
                                                           
35  Rapozo cited to Gaylord.  In Gaylord, which was decided approximately 
fifteen years after Rapozo’s conviction and sentence became final and 
approximately ten years after Johnson, this court stated: 
 
Although statutorily authorized by HRS § 706 –
605(1)(d), a sentencing court ’s discretion to order 
restitution is not boundless.  “Advocates of criminal 
restitution are convinced [that] it is not necessarily 
incompatible with the incarceration of offender s.  And we 
concur.  However, even the supporters of the concept 
acknowledge [that] its implementation is fraught with 
difficulty, primarily because incarceration normally 
entails a concomitant loss of earning capacity.”  Murray, 
63 Haw. at 24, 621 P.2d at 342 (citations omitted).  
 For this reason, among others, HRS § 706 –605(1)(d) 
limits restitution orders to “an amount the defendant can 
afford to pay.”  See State v. Johnson , 68 Haw. 292, 297, 
711 P.2d 1295, 1299 (1985); Murray, 63 Haw. at 25, 621 P.2d 
at 343.  In this connection, and despite the fact that the 
sentencing court “may delegate to the Adult Probation 
Division the function of making recommendations . . . on 
the amount of restitution and the manner of payment, the 
court has the exclusive responsib ility and function of 
imposing a sentence.”  Johnson, 68 Haw. at 297, 711 P.2d at 
1299.  Thus, “requisite specificity should be provided by 
the sentencing court and ought not be left to subsequent 
administrative determination,” Murray, 63 Haw. at 25, 621 
P.2d at 343 (citations omitted), because “[w]ithout express 
legislative authority, the court cannot delegate the 
sentencing function to another person or entity.”  Johnson, 
68 Haw. at 297, 711 P.2d at 1299.  Cf. United States v. 
Porter, 41 F.3d 68, 71 (2d C ir. 1994) (sentencing court 
cannot delegate to probation department, either as to 
amount or scheduling of installment payments, judicial 
functions inherent in grant of restitution); United States 
v. Weichert , 836 F.2d 769, 772 (2d Cir. 1988) (sentencing 
court may not authorize probation officer to make post -
sentencing decision as to amount of restitution), cert. 
denied, 488 U.S. 1017, 109 S.Ct. 813, 102 L.Ed.2d 802 
(1989); United States v. Ahmad , 2 F.3d 245, 248 –49 (7th 
Cir. 1993) (sentencing court may not authorize probation 
officer to make post -sentencing decision as to scheduling 
of installment payments).  Accordingly, “it is incumbent 
upon the [sentencing] court to enter into the record 
findings of fact and conclusions that the manner of payment 
is reaso nable and one which [the defendant] can afford.”   
Johnson, 68 Haw. at 297 –98, 711 P.2d at 1299.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER ***  
 
29 
 was decided approximately five years after Rapozo’s conviction 
and sentence bec ame final , this court explicitly  held that the 
trial court has the exclus ive responsibility and function of 
imposing a sentence, and could not delegate its sentencing 
function to another entity without express legislative 
authority:  
 Defendant contends that the trial court erred in 
failing to consider Defendant’s ability to pa y the 
restitution amount ordered by the court.  Defendant argues 
that the trial court’s order did not comport with the 
language, “in an amount . . . can afford to pay” in HRS § 
706–605(1)(e) and HRS § 706 –624(2)(i).  
 Although the trial court may delegate t o the Adult 
Probation Division the function of making recommendations 
to the court on the amount of restitution and the manner of 
payment, the court has the exclusive responsibility and 
function of imposing a sentence.  Without express 
legislative authorit y, the court cannot delegate the 
sentencing function to another person or entity.  “The 
requisite specificity should be provided by the sentencing 
court and ought not be left to subsequent administrative 
determination.”  State v. Murray , [63 Haw.] at 25, 6 21 P.2d 
at 343 (citations omitted).  
 
                                                                  
(. . .continued)  
In addition, we hold that the sentencing court ’s 
restitution order failed to comply with HRS § 706 –605(1)(d) 
and was illegally imposed.  In disregard  of Johnson, 68 
Haw. at 297 –98, 711 P.2d at 1299, the sentencing court 
failed to make any finding that $122,248.95 was an amount 
that Gaylord could afford to pay in restitution (indeed, as 
noted, the sentencing court viewed Gaylord ’s “sources of 
restitutio n” as “highly unlikely and highly speculative and 
unreliable”) and to prescribe the manner of payment.   To 
compound the error, in its December 13, 1991 judgment of 
conviction, the sentencing court expressly and improperly 
delegated the judicial function of  determining the manner 
of payment to an administrative body —the Hawaiʻi Paroling 
Authority.   Johnson, 68 Haw. at 297, 711 P.2d at 1299; 
Murray, 63 Haw. at 25, 621 P.2d at 343.  
 
78 Hawaiʻi at 151-53, 155, 890 P.2d at 1191 -93, 1195 (alterations and ellipsis  
in original)  (footnote omitted) . *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER ***  
 
30 
 68 Haw. at 297, 711 P.2d at 1299  (ellipsis in original)  
(footnotes omitted) .  Thus, the delegation was an illegal 
sentence .  See Gaylord, 78 Hawaiʻi at 155, 890 P.2d at 1195 
(holding the sentencing court’s restitution order failed to 
comply with HRS § 706 -605(1)(d) and Johnson and was “illegally 
imposed”).  
 Although the delegation constituted an illegal sentence, 
because Johnson was decided after Ra pozo’s conviction and 
sentence became final, we must address whether its holding  (that 
the trial court has the exclusive responsibility and function of 
determining the manner of payment and cannot delegate that 
judicial function to an administrative body w ithout express 
legislative authority ) (1) is a “new rule”; and, if so, (2) 
whether it retroactively applies to Rapozo’s case.  Thus, 
whether Johnson created a “new rule” is the preliminary inquiry.  
  a. Retroactive application of new rules  
Based on the rea soning that follows, we hold that Johnson 
did not create a “new rule.”  T he ICA incorrectly applied the 
Teague framework to conclude that the Johnson rule did not 
retroactively apply to Rapozo’s sentence.  Teague is 
inapplicable to Johnson, as Johnson did not set out a “new 
rule.”  
 “When questions of state law are at issue, state courts 
generally have the authority to determine the retroactivity of *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER ***  
 
31 
 their own decisions.”  Schwartz v. State , 136 Hawaiʻi 258, 272, 
361 P.3d 1161, 1175 (2015).  “Although judicial decisions are 
assumed to apply retroactively, such application is not 
automatic,” State v. Ikezawa , 75 Haw. 210, 220, 857 P.2d 593, 
597 (1993), as “the Constitution neither prohibits nor requires  
retrospective effect.”  State v. Santiago , 53 Haw. 254, 268, 492 
P.2d 657, 665 (1971)  (cleaned up) .  Thus, the threshold question 
is whether Johnson created a new rule.  
 There are four guiding principles in determining whether a 
“new rule” has been create d.  First, “[t]he prototypical manner 
in which this court creates a new rule is when it overrules a 
previous decision and announces a superseding principle of law.”   
Schwartz , 136 Hawaiʻi at 272, 361 P.3d at 1175.  Second, 
“[a]nother classic situation in which this court establishes a 
new rule is when it announces a new principle of constitutional 
law, such as one applying to criminal prosecutions .”  136 Hawaiʻi 
at 273, 361 P.3d at 1176.   However, “in instances where this 
court engages only in statutory construction to elucidate the 
meaning and application of specific provisions of a statute, we 
have held that  a new rule does not arise.”  136 Hawaiʻi at 274, 
361 P.3d at 1177.  Finally, a  new rule is not created “where 
this court merely clarifies an existing legal principle  . . . .”  
Id.    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER ***  
 
32 
  The holding  in Johnson regarding the trial court’s  
exclusive responsibility and function of determining the manner 
of payment of restitution, which can not be delegated to an 
administrative body without express legislative authority,  
“merely clarifie[d] an existing legal principle  . . . .”  See 
id.  Johnson actually clarified the legal principle this court 
set out in Murray: that “[t]he requisite specific ity should be 
provided by the sentencing court and ought not be left to 
subsequent administrative determination.”  Murray, 63 Haw. at 
25, 621 P.2d at 343.   
Thus, the Johnson rule was based on Murray, which was  
decided approximately two months after Rapozo ’s conviction and 
sentence became final and approximately five years before 
Johnson.  Murray was the first Hawaiʻi case to discuss  HRS § 706 -
605 and the status and function of restitution in Hawaiʻi’s 
criminal system.  Murray “careful[ly] examin[ed]” the 
restitution statute , looking at the purpose, design, and policy 
of the statute, which authorizes a trial court to  order a 
defendant to pay restitution in addition to imprisonment.  See 
63 Haw. at 17 -19, 621 P.2d at 338 -39.  The Murray court then 
discussed the “statutory and constitutional constraints” of 
restitution orders, stating : 
The prescription of penalties is a  legislative 
prerogative, State v. Freitas , 61 Haw. 262, 267, 602 P.2d 
914, 919 (1979), but a sentencing court is nonetheless 
afforded wide latitude in the selection of penalties from *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER ***  
 
33 
 those prescribed and in the determination of their 
severity.  This autho rity is normally undisturbed on review 
in the absence of an apparent abuse of discretion, State v. 
Fry, 61 Haw. 226, 231, 602 P.2d 13, 17 (1979); State v. 
Martin, 56 Haw. 292, 294, 535 P.2d 127, 128 (1975), or 
unless applicable statutory and constitutional  commands 
have not been observed.  The sentence here was subject to a 
legislative declaration that restitution should be in an 
amount the defendant “can afford to pay.”  The record 
indicates the sentencing court itself acknowledged 
defendant's lack of capa city for actual compliance.  Thus, 
restitution could not have been in an amount defendant “can 
afford to pay.”  Moreover, a restitution order patently 
beyond an offender’s capacity for compliance serves no 
purpose, reparative or otherwise.   See Commonwealt h v. 
Fuqua, 267 Pa.Super. 504, 508 -509, 407 A.2d 24, 26 (1979); 
People v. Kay , 36 Cal.App.3d 759, 763, 111 Cal.Rptr. 894, 
896 (1973).  
 While we do not reach equal protection and due 
process, they may be considerations on resentencing.  The 
principles enunc iated in cases like Tate v. Short , 401 U.S. 
395, 91 S.Ct. 668, 28 L.Ed.2d 130 (1971); Williams v. 
Illinois , 399 U.S. 235, 90 S.Ct. 2018, 26 L.Ed.2d 586 
(1970); and State v. Huggett , 55 Haw. 632, 638, 525 P.2d 
1119, 1124 (1974), are often pertinent where a novel 
sentencing alternative is selected.  State v. Huggett , for 
example, teaches us that some degree of specificity is an 
essential element of a sentence.  A defendant must be 
apprised of “what is required of him, and when it is 
required, so that he will know when he is in default.” 
State v. Calderilla , supra, 34 Or.App. at 1010, 580 P.2d at 
579.  The requisite specificity should be provided by the 
sentencing court and ought not be left to subsequent 
administrative determination.  See, for example, Mason v. 
State, 46 Md. App. 1, 9, 415 A.2d 315, 319 (1980) and 
Kroenke v. State , 366 So.2d 46 (Fla.App. 1979).  
 
63 Haw. at 25, 621 P.2d at 342 -43.  
 As Johnson “merely clarfie[d]” the legal principle set 
forth in Murray, we must then actually  address whether Murray 
created a “new rule,” as Murray was decided approximately two 
months after Rapozo’s conviction and sentence became final .  It 
is clear that Murray “engage[d] only in statutory construction 
to elucidate the meaning and application of specific provisions 
of a statute.”  See Schwartz , 136 Hawaiʻi at 274, 361 P.3d at *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER ***  
 
34 
 1177.  Therefore, Murray did not create a “new rule.”  See 
Rivers v. Roadway Exp., Inc. , 511 U.S. 298, 312 -13 (1994) (“A 
judicial construction of a statute is an authoritative statement 
of what the statute meant before as well as aft er the decision 
of the case giving rise to that construction.”).  As such, 
Johnson, which relied on Murray, also did not create a “new 
rule.” 
 Further, HRPP Rule 40(a)(3) does not bar this claim.  
Although Rapozo could have raised this claim in his previou s 
seven HR PP Rule 40 petitions or other proceedings, as explained 
above, this is a claim of illegal sentence.  T he trial court’s 
sentence  that Rapozo pay “restitution in the amount of 
$11,109.33, the manner of payment to be determined and handled 
by the De partment of Social Services and Housing” was illegal 
because the trial court exceeded its authority  by delegating the 
manner of payment to the DSSH  in sentencing Rapozo . 
Thus, Rapozo’s second point of error raise d a colorable 
claim and the circuit court er red by denying Rapozo’s request 
for relief  without a hearing .36   
 
 
                                                           
36  To the extent Rapozo argued that the jury should have determined the 
manner of payment of restitution, we conclude it is not a colorable claim.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER ***  
 
35 
 2. Rapozo stated a colorable  claim that the trial court 
erred by ordering him to pay restitution without first 
determining whether he could afford to pay it 
 
 The ICA concluded it would not c onsider Rapozo’s first and 
fourth points of error,  that the trial court erred by ordering 
restitution without first determining whether he could afford to 
pay it, because it was raised for the first time on appeal.  
However, construing Rapozo’s pleadings l iberally, Rapozo raised 
the “afford to pay” issue in his motion for revocation of 
restitution , in which he argued : 
Two other issues remain regarding sentencing and 
restitution.  One is, had it been legal for the sentencing 
court to impose restitution in th is case, it cannot 
delegate the determination of the manner of payment of 
restitution to another person or entity.  State v. Gaylord , 
78 Haw. 127, 153, 155, 890 P.2d 1167, 1193, 1195 (1995).  
In Gaylord, the Hawaii Supreme Court stated that “ it is 
incumben t upon the [sentencing court] to enter into the 
record findings of fact and conclusions that the manner of 
payment is reasonable and one which [the defendant] can 
afford.”  Id. at 153, 890 P.2d 1191.  No determination was 
ever made in the instant case . 
 
(Emphases added.)   We therefore address this argument.  
In Johnson, the trial court ordered restitution to be paid 
“in a manner to be determined by the Adult Probation Division.”  
68 Haw. at 297, 711 P.2d at 1299.   This court hel d: 
We view the clause, “in a m anner to be determined by 
the Adult Probation Division” to mean the manner of payment 
of the restitution amount.  The manner of payment must be 
reasonable and one that Defendant can afford taking into 
account Defendant’s financial circumstances.  See State v. 
Garner, 115 Ariz. 579, 566 P.2d 1055 (1977); State v. 
Harris, [362 A.2d 32 (1976)].  
The record indicates that Defendant was denied an 
opportunity to challenge the reasonableness of the Adult 
Probation Division’s recommendation relative to the manner 
of payment of the restitution amount.  This infringes on 
Defendant’s right to due process as guaranteed under the 
Fourteenth Amendment, section 1 of the United States *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER ***  
 
36 
 Constitution.  See Note, Victim Restitution in the Criminal 
Process: A Procedural Analysis , 97 Harv.L.Rev. 931, 944 n. 
92 (1984) ( citing Boddie v. Connecticut , 401 U.S. 371, 377, 
91 S.Ct. 780, 785 –86, 28 L.Ed.2d 113 (1971)).  
We hold that it is incumbent upon the trial court to 
enter into the record findings of fact and conclusions that 
the manne r of payment is reasonable and one which Defendant 
can afford.  Here, the trial court failed to make such 
findings and conclusion.  
 
Id. 
Then, in  Gaylord, this court stated,  
Presumably, the sentencing court’s conceded “exclusive 
responsibility and function ” derives from the statutory 
phrase, “in an amount the defendant can afford to pay, ” set 
forth in HRS § 706 -605(1)(d).  It seems intuitively obvious 
to us that a sentencing court cannot determine restitution 
“in an amount the defendant can afford to pay ” without 
determining the manner of payment . 
 
78 Hawaiʻi at 153 n.50, 890 P.2d at 1193 n.50.    
As explained  above, “in instances where this court engages 
only in statutory construction to elucidate the meaning and 
application of specific provisions of a statute, we have held 
that a new rule does not arise.”  Schwartz , 136 Hawaiʻi at 274, 
361 P.3d at 1177.   The Gaylord court interpreted the phrase  
“determining the manner of payment”  in HRS § 706 -605(1) to 
conclude  that it included “in an amount the defendant can afford 
to pay.”   78 Hawaiʻi at 153 n.50, 890 P.2d  at 1193 n.50.  This 
interpretation “ was not a departure from precedent but, rather, 
confirmed the law as it existed” at the time of Rapozo’s 
sentence and conviction.   See Garcia, 125 Hawaiʻi 429, 443, 263 
P.3d 709, 723 (2010). *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER ***  
 
37 
 Further, like with Rapozo’s second point of error, HRPP 
Rule 40(a)(3) does not preclude this claim because this was a 
claim of illegal sentence because, as discussed above, the trial 
court improperly delegated the manner of repayment of 
restitution.  Therefore, we hold Rapozo ’s first  and fourth 
points of error  stated a colorable claim that the trial court 
erred by failing to determine whether the restitution  was in an 
amount he could afford to pay.  
3. Rapozo stated a colorable claim  that the HPA erred by 
denying parole for nonpayment of restitution  
 
 In his fifth point of error, Rapozo argued the HPA erred by 
“disallowing [Rapozo]’s possibility of parole for non -payment of 
a fee, fine, or restitution.”  The ICA concluded the circuit 
court did not err in ruling this argument meritless, as none of 
the HPA parole decisions in the record referenced payment of 
restitution as a condition of parole ; and this argument was 
waived as  it challenged an HPA parole decision and did not 
implicate an illegal sentence imposed by the circuit court, and  
Rapozo failed to prove extraordinary circumstances justifying 
his failure to raise the issue .  For the reasons discussed 
below, we hold the ICA erred.    
a. Rapozo stated a colorable claim that he was 
denied parole due to nonpayment of restitution  
 
“Parole i s a matter of legislative grace, and the denial of 
it to certain offenders is within legislative discretion.”  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER ***  
 
38 
 Williamson v. Hawaiʻi Paroling Authority , 97 Hawaiʻi 183, 195, 35 
P.3d 210, 222 (2001) (cleaned up).  
In granting or denying parole, the statutory standard 
to be applied by the HPA is that “[n]o parole shall be 
granted unless it appears to the [HPA] that there is a 
reasonable  probability that the prisoner concerned will 
live and remain at liberty without violating the law and 
that the prisoner’s release is not incompatible with the 
welfare and safety of society.”  
 
Turner v. Hawaii Paroling Authority , 93 Hawaiʻi 298, 30 2, 1 P.3d 
768, 772 (App. 2000)  (alterations in original) (quoting HRS § 
353-65 (2015)).  Incarcerated people or parolees do not have a 
right to parole.  Hawaiʻi Administrative Rules (“HAR”) § 23 -700-
37 (1992).    
The HPA has the power to establish rules and regulat ions 
“under which any prisoner may be paroled  . . . .”  HRS § 353 -65.  
The HPA established such rules in H AR §§ 23-700-31 to -37.  
Under HAR § 23 -700-33, the HPA uses the following guidelines to 
determine parole eligibility :37 
Parole shall not be granted un less it appears to the 
Authority that there is a reasonable probability that the 
inmate concerned will live and remain at liberty without 
violating the law and that the inmate’s release is not 
incompatible with the welfare and safety of society.  
Parole is  not a right of an inmate or parolee .  Parole may 
be denied to an inmate when the Authority finds:  
 
(a) The inmate does not have a viable parole plan;  
(b) The inmate has been a management or security 
problem in prison as evidenced by the inmate’s 
misconduc t record;  
(c) The inmate has refused to participate in 
recommended prison programs ;

who is assessed as low risk for  re-offending).  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER ***  
 
39 
 (d) The inmate’s behavior in prison is a continuation 
of the behavior that led to the inmate’s 
imprisonment;  
(e) The inmate has a pending prison misconduct;  
(f) The inmate does not have the ability or 
commitment to comply with conditions of parole ; 
(g) The inmate has pending criminal charges which 
arose from inmate’s current incarceration or last 
parole; 
(h) The inmate has a parole plan for a state that has 
not accepted the inmate for supervision; or  
(i) The inmate has expressed little or no interest in 
parole.

HRS § 353 -64 (2015) states in relevant part:  
[T]o be eligible for parole, the committed person, if the 
person is determined by the department to be  suitable for 
participation, must have been a participant in an academic, 
vocational education, or prison industry program authorized 
by the department and must have been involved in or 
completed the program to the satisfaction of the 
department ; and provi ded further that this precondition for 
parole shall not apply if the committed person is in a 
correctional facility where academic, vocational education, 
and prison industry programs or facilities are not 
available.  A grant of parole shall not be subject to 
acceptance by the committed person.  
 
(Emphasis added.)  
HRS § 353 -69 (2015) states:  
Excepted as provided in section 706 -670, no parole 
shall be granted unless it appears to the Hawaii paroling 
authority that there is a reasonable probability that the 
prisoner concerned will live and remain at liberty without 
violating the law and that the prisoner’s release is not 
incompatible with the welfare and safety of society.  
 
Whether to grant or deny parole is discretionary with the 
HPA.  See State v. Keohokapu , 127 Hawaiʻi 91, 112, 276 P.3d 660, 
681 (2012) (“Whether the defendant will ever be paroled is pure 
speculation since parole is dependent on circumstances in the 
future and is discretionary with the Hawaiʻi Paroling *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER ***

 Authority.”).  Although “[t]he legislatur e did not expressly 
provide a means to appeal HPA parole decisions,”  Williamson , 97 
Hawaiʻi at 189, 35 P.3d at 216, an incarcerated person may still 
seek judicial review of the HPA’s denial of parole through a n 
HRPP Rule 40 petition.  97 Hawaiʻi at 194, 3 5 P.3d at 221 (citing 
Turner, 93 Hawaiʻi at 307-08, 1 P.3d at 777 -78).  “HRPP Rule 
40(a) clearly indicates that the post -conviction proceeding 
under the rule was intended to ‘encompass all common law and 
statutory procedures for the same purpose, including  habeas 
corpus and coram nobis.’”  State v. Kaluna , 106 Hawaiʻi 198, 204, 
103 P.3d 358, 364 (2004).  “The chief use of habeas corpus has 
been to seek the release of persons held in actual, physical 
custody.”  Id. (cleaned up) (quoting Turner, 93 Hawaiʻi at 307, 1 
P.3d at 777).  “[B]ecause a denial of parole continues physical 
custody, such denial is a proper subject of a writ of habeas 
corpus and, therefore, an inmate denied parole may be entitled 
to relief through the mechanism of a [n] HRPP Rule 40 petitio n.”  
Turner, 93 Hawaiʻi at 307, 1 P.3d at 777.  An incarcerated person 
seeking relief from a n HPA decision to deny parole does so under 
HRPP Rule 40(a)(2) as they are in “custody based upon a judgment 
of conviction.”  See HRPP Rule 40(a)(2); Turner, 93 Hawaiʻi at 
306, 1 P.3d a t 776 (“It is plain that Appellant is in ‘custody 
based on a judgment of conviction.’” (quoting HRPP Rule *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER ***  
 
41 
 40(a)(2)) .  Therefore, HRPP Rule 40 petitions challenging a n HPA 
decision to deny parole  are subject to HRPP Rule 40(a)(3).  
Here, under HRPP Rule 40(a )(3), Rapozo waived his  
challenge s to the HPA parole denials  from 2006 through 20 11.  
Rapozo could have challenged the se HPA parole denials in his 
previous seven HRPP Rule 40 petitions or other proceedings  
before his eighth HRPP Rule 40 petition , but he di d not do so 
and he did not prove extraordinary circumstances justifying his 
failure to do so .38  Thus, we address only the 2012 and 2013 HPA 
parole denials.39   
Hawaiʻi courts may review “a decision denying parole in 
situations where the parole board has fai led to exercise any 
discretion at all, or arbitrarily and capriciously abused its 
discretion so as to give rise to a due process violation or has 
otherwise violated any constitutional rights of the prisoner.”  
Williamson , 97 Hawaiʻi at 195, 35 P.3d at 222 (cleaned up) 
(quoting Turner, 93 Hawaiʻi at 308, 1 P.3d at 778).   
The ICA concluded that notwithstanding the 1979 minimum 
term order that stated, “Parole shall not be granted until 
                                                           
38  The 2006 and 2007 HPA parole denials were raised and ruled upon in 
Rapozo’s 2008 HRPP Rule 40 proceeding.  
 
39  The 2012 and 2013 HPA parole denials were not waived by Rapozo  in his 
eighth HRPP Rule 40 petition .  The HPA denied Rapozo’s parole requests on 
August 28, 2012, and July 29, 2013 , after Rapozo’s January 10, 2012 seventh 
HRPP Rule 40 petition and before the June 9, 2014 eighth HRPP Rule 40 
petition .  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER ***  
 
42 
 judg[]ment of restitution is satisfied,” none of the eleven HPA 
parole dec isions in the record referenced restitution payment as 
a condition of parole , and therefore  the circuit court did not 
err by denying Rapozo’s request for relief without a hearing .40  
We conclude otherwise.  
The 2012 HPA parole decision stated parole was deni ed 
because the HPA was “not convinced that [Rapozo c ould] 
substantially comply with the terms and conditions of parole,” 
and recommended “[t]hat [Rapozo] participate in all RAD 
recommended programs. ”  The HPA denied  parole in 2013 as  
follows: “REASON FOR D ENIAL:  Your participation in work 
furlough while incarcerated will significantly enhance your 
success on parole.”   
Yet, the 1979 HPA minimum term order expressly stated that 
“[p]arole shall not be granted until judg[]ment of restitution 
is satisfied.”   Although Johnson asserted Rapozo’s parole 
denials, including the 2012 and 2013 HPA parole denials,  were 
not based on nonpayment of restitution,  he was not a member of 
the three -member HPA that decides whether to grant parole.  
Therefore,  despite Johnson’s a ssertion that Rapozo’s parole was 
not based on nonpayment of restitution,  the record  is unclear as 
                                                           
40  The ICA allude d to the HPA decisions to deny parole from 2014 to 2016.  
The 2014 though 2016 HPA parole denials, which were decided after the eighth 
HRPP Rule 40 petition, could not be raised, and were not raised, in the 
eighth HRPP Rule 40 petition.  Therefore, we decl ine to address those HPA 
parole decisions.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER ***

 to whether the three  HPA members considered the condition in the 
1979 minimum term order  in denying Rapozo’s parole .  See 
Williamson , 97 Hawaiʻi at 194-95, 35 P.3d at 221 -22 (“It would be 
impossible for a court to properly evaluate a parole denial 
because of the many variables considered by the board, such as 
record facts, personal observations and the experience of the 
decision maker which leads to a ‘predict ive judgment’ as to what 
is best for both the inmate and the community.”  (cleaned up)  
(quoting Turner, 93 Hawaiʻi at 307-08, 1 P.3d at 777 -78)).  
Therefore, Rapozo’s claim that he was denied parole for 
nonpayment of restitution cannot be said to be “patently 
frivolous, and without a trace of support  . . . .”  Rapozo 
raised a colorable claim that he was denied parol e for 
nonpayment of restitution and the circuit court erred by denying 
Rapozo’s request for relief without a hearing.  
4. Rapozo stated a colorable claim  that the HPA erred by 
denying him parole for failure to complete or 
participate in the work furlough pr ogram 
 
 In his seventh point of error, Rapozo argued the HPA erred 
by denying him parole for failure to complete or participate in 
the work furlough program, when it was only available in Hawaiʻi 
and he had never been returned to Hawaiʻi to participate in the 
work furlough program.  As discussed, only the 2012 and 2013 HPA 
parole denials are properly before us; Rapozo’s seventh point of 
error is therefore a challenge to the 2013 HPA parole denia l.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER ***  
 
44 
 HRS § 353 -64 states :  
[T]o be eligible for parole, the committed person, if the 
person is determined by the department to be suitable for 
participation, must have been a participant in an academic, 
vocational education, or prison industry program auth orized 
by the department and must have been involved in or 
completed the program to the satisfaction of the 
department  . . . . 
 
 Thus, the HPA may properly deny an incarcerated person 
parole based on their failure to participate in or complete a 
“prison in dustry program,” which appears to include work 
furlough programs.  
Here, the 2013 HPA decision denied Rapozo’s parole request , 
stating, “Your participation in work furlough while incarcerated 
will significantly enhance your success on parole.”  Rapozo 
argued he had never been able to participate in the work 
furlough program, which was located in Hawaiʻi, as he had never 
been returned to Hawaiʻi.  According to Johnson’s declaration,  
however,  the HPA d id not control when and which incarcerated 
people are transported from Arizona to Hawaiʻi to participate in 
the work furlough program , and the DPS was resp onsible for the 
work furlough program and transporting inmates.   
Although the HPA recommended he participate  in or complete 
the work furlough program, Rapozo was never given the 
opportunity to do so.  It may be arbitrary and capricious t o 
deny an incarcer ated person parole for failure to participate in *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER ***  
 
45 
 a program while never giving them an opportunity to do so.41  
Thus, Rapozo stated a colorable claim, and the circuit court 
erred by denying this claim without a hearing.  
5. Rapozo’s remaining claims  are merit less, raised for 
the first time on appeal, or waived  
 
 We agree with the ICA ’s reasoning  that Rapozo’s third, 
tenth, eleventh, twelfth, and fourteenth points of error are 
meritless.   As the ICA also concluded, Rapozo’s ninth point of 
error is deemed waived  because his opening brief did not contain 
an argument on this point.  See HRAP Rule 28(b)(7) (“Points not 
argued may be deemed waived.”).  
                                                           
41  In Regan v. Hawaii , Civ. No. 07 -00029 JMS -BMK, 2007 WL 4440956 (D. Haw. 
Dec. 19, 2007) (order), the petitioner moved for reconsideration of the 
dismissal of four counts relating to his “right” to parole pursuan t to HRS § 
353-64, asserting he was unable to attend the programs needed to be eligible 
for parole.  2007 WL 4440956, at *1 -3.  The court  denied the motion, 
concluding:  
 
Plaintiff argues that because enrollment in some of 
the programs that were required fo r his parole were 
unavailable to him, he is eligible for parole without 
attending any of these programs.   He is mistaken.  First, 
simply because Plaintiff was unable to take part in these 
programs prior to his parole hearing does not make them 
“unavailable ” at the prison.   Plaintiff may not have been 
eligible for these programs for various reasons ( e.g., due 
to his custody or housing status), but they are, by 
Plaintiff ’s own submission, offered at the prison.   Second, 
and more importantly, as the court has already found, 
Plaintiff has no state -created liberty interest in parole.   
Thus, even if Plaintiff completed the programs that were 
required for parole, the Hawaii Paroling Authority may, 
nonetheless, deny him parole.  
 
2007 WL 4440956, at *3 (footnote omit ted).   
 
 Regan is distinguishable.  Here, Rapozo did not argue he had a right to 
parole; rather, Rapozo argued the HPA erred by denying him parole.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC  REPORTER ***  
 
46 
  We do not consider Rapozo’s sixth , eighth, and thirteenth 
points of error , which were raised for the first time on a ppeal.  
See Dan, 76 Hawaiʻi at 431, 879 P.2d at 536.  
V. Conclusion  
 For the reasons explained above, we vacate the ICA’s April 
5, 2021 judgment on appeal and the circuit court’s June 21, 2016 
order denying the eighth HRPP Rule 40 petition .  We remand this  
case to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent 
with this opinion.
