OPINION OF THE COURT BY POLLACK, J. 
  Th e appeal in this case ar ises from a challenge by 
Benjamin Eduwensuyi to  the validity of his  waiver of the right 
to testify at trial and the propriety of the conviction that 
ensued.  We hold that the record does not support a conclusion 
that Eduwensuyi’s waiver of the right to tes tify was 
voluntarily, intelligently, and knowingly made.  Because the Electronically Filed

2 error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, we vacate the 
conviction and remand the case for further proceedings.  
I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
 
 On February 1, 2016, Eduwensuyi was charged by 
complaint in the Honolulu District Court of the First Circuit 
(district court) with operating a vehicle under the influence of 
an intoxicant in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 
291E-61(a)(1).1  A bench trial took place on July 11, 2016.2  
Prior to the presentation of evidence, the district court 
advised Eduwensuyi as follows: 
 THE COURT: . . . I have to advise you that you have a 
right to testify if you choose to do so.  
 THE DEFENDANT: Yes, Your Honor.  
 THE COURT: And you also ha
ve a right not to testify.  
That’s up to you.  I’ll question you further toward the end 
of the trial as to whether or not you want to waive either 
of these rights, to make sure that you’ve been fully 
informed of your rights and to make sure that any decision 
you make is your decision, it’s voluntary, okay.  So your 
attorney can give you advice about whether or not you 
should or should not testify, but ultimately, it’s your 
decision.  Do you understand that?  
                     
 1 HRS § 291E -61(a)(1) (Supp. 2015) provides as follows:  
A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle under 
the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates or 
assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:  
 (1) While under the influence  of alcohol in an amount 
sufficient to impair the person’s normal mental faculties 
or ability to care for the person and guard against 
casualty[.]  
 2 The Honorable  Richard J. Diehl presided over the trial 
proceedings. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
3  THE DEFENDANT: Yes, Your Honor.  
 THE COURT: Okay, very well.  We can readily proceed 
then. 
  The State presented the testimony of one witness, 
Officer Jessie Takushi of the Honolulu Police Department.   
Officer Takushi testified that at approximately 4:37 a.m.  on 
January 17, 2016, he stopped a vehicle occupied by Eduwensuyi 
for multiple traffic infractions, including crossing a double 
solid yellow line. 
  According to Officer Takushi, as he was approaching 
Eduwensuyi’s vehicle, he saw Eduwensuyi climbing from the 
driver’s seat into the passenger’s seat.  W hen Officer Takushi 
reached the vehicle, he noticed that there was a different male 
in the driver’s seat and that Eduwensuyi was “kind of laying 
down on the passenger’s side with his feet still in the driver’s 
seat area.”
 
  Officer Takushi testified that he asked Eduwensuyi for 
his driver’s license, registration, and insurance, which 
Eduwensuyi provided.  Officer Takushi stated that Eduwensuyi’s 
eyes were red and watery, his speech was slurred, and an odor of 
alcohol emanated from inside the vehicle.  At Officer Takushi’s 
request, Eduwensuyi agreed to participate in the standardized 
field sobriety test.  According to Officer Takushi, Eduwensuyi 
was unsteady on his feet, he swayed while standing, and he ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
4 dragged his feet when walking.  Officer Takushi acknowledged 
that his report did not mention that Eduwensuyi was swaying 
while standing. 
  Following Officer Takushi’s testimony, the St ate 
rested.  The defense then informed the district court that it 
would not be presenting evidence, and the following exchange 
occurred: 
 THE COURT: . . . sir, you do have a right to testify 
if you choose to do so, as I said at the beginning of the 
trial.  And if you testify, though, the prosecutor can 
cross-examine you and ask you questions.  If you decide not 
to testify, the court --  I can’t hold it against you, nor 
would I, that you are not going to testify.  Okay, doesn’t 
mean anything one way or the other to the court.  Do you 
understand these rights?  
 THE DEFENDANT: Yes, Your Honor.  
 THE COURT: All right.  And  have you consulted with 
your attorney about whether or not you wish to testify?  
 THE DEFENDANT: I like to take a second to do so right 
now, sir.  
 THE COURT: Pardon me?  
 THE DEFENDANT: I’d like to take a second right now, 
Your Honor -- . . . -- to do so again. 
 THE COURT: -- very well.  
 THE DEFENDANT: Yes, Your Honor.  
 THE COURT: You have consulted with your attorney?  
 THE DEFENDANT: Yes.  
 THE COURT: And do you wish to testify?  
 THE DEFENDANT: No, I’m not -- 
 THE COURT: Okay. 
 THE DEFENDANT: --  Your Honor. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
5  THE COURT: Okay, the court finds that the defendant 
has been advised of his rights, has knowingly, 
intelligently, and voluntarily waived the right to testify 
or not to testify. . . . .  
Eduwensuyi then moved for judgment of acquittal, which motion 
the court denied. 
  The district court found Eduwensuyi guilty of 
operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant in 
violation of HRS § 291E -61(a)(1) and imposed sentence.3  
Eduwensuyi appealed to the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) 
from the district court’s judgment ent ered on July 11, 2016. 
II. ICA PROCEEDINGS 
 
 In his opening brief, Eduwensuyi argued that under 
Tachibana v. State , 79 Hawaii 226, 236, 900 P.2d 1293, 1303 
(1995), the district court was required to engage him in a 
colloquy prior to accepting his waiver of the right to testify 
to ensure he was knowingly, voluntarily,  and intelligently 
relinquishing his rights.  Eduwensuyi  contended that the court’s 
Tachibana colloquy was incomplete and defective because the 
court did not advise him that he had a right not to testify and 
that if he wanted to testify no one could prevent him from doing 
                     
 3 The district court sentenced Eduwensuyi to the following: pay a 
fine and fees totaling $562; submit to a substance abuse assessment and 
obtain recommended treatment; and participate in a 14 -hour substance abuse 
rehabilitation program.  The district court further ordered that Eduwensuyi’s 
license be revoked for a period of one year.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
6 so.  Because the colloquy was defective, Eduwensuyi maintained,  
any waiver by him was not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. 
  In addition, Eduwensuyi contended that the court 
failed to engage in a true exchange during the colloquy.  
Eduwensuyi argued that, instead of administering the colloquy in 
segments and asking Eduwensuyi whether he understood each 
advisement, the district court simply recited a 
litany of 
rights.  (Citing State v. Christian , 88 Hawaii 407, 967 P.2d 239 
(1998).)  Eduwensuyi added that there was nothing in the record 
to establish that he understood each of his rights or that the 
court had an objective basis for finding that his wai
ver of the 
right to testify was validly made. 
  Eduwensuyi further submitted that the district court’s 
violation of the requirements of Tachibana  was not harmless 
beyond a reasonable doubt because the record offered no hint as 
to whether his testimony, had he given it, could have 
established reasonable doubt that he operated a vehicle under 
the influence of an intoxicant.  Eduwensuyi concluded that, 
because it is inherently  uncertain what he would have testified 
to at trial, there is a reasonable possibility that the 
violation of his constitutional right to testify contributed to 
his conviction.
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
7   In  its answering brief, the State first addressed 
Eduwensuyi’s contention that the district court failed to engage 
in a true exchange during the Tachibana colloquy.  The State 
noted that the court asked Eduwensuyi at the end of both the 
pretrial advisement and the ultimate colloquy whether he 
understood his rights and, in both instances, Eduwensuyi 
responded in the affirmative.  The State added that Eduwensuyi 
was also permitted to consult with defense counsel regarding the 
waiver.  Hence, the State argued that the court’s exchange with 
Eduwensuyi was sufficient to enable the court to ascertain 
Eduwensuyi’s understanding of the court’s advisements.  
  Turning to the contents of the pretrial advisement and 
the ultimate colloquy, the State acknowledged that the district 
court’s pretrial advisement was deficient in that the court did 
not advise Eduwensuyi that his decision not to testify could not 
be used against him by th e factfinder.  The State submitted 
that, because the pretrial advisement is reviewed for actual 
prejudice, the district court could have rectified the error by 
ensuring that Eduwensuyi was fully informed of his rights in the 
ultimate colloquy.  
The State conceded , however, that “the 
ultimate colloquy was also deficient in some respects” because 
the district court failed to inform Eduwensuyi of two of the 
five basic requirements of Tachibana --namely
, that if he wanted  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
8 to testify, no one could prevent him from doing so and that he 
had the right not to testify. 
  The State further acknowledged that the district 
court’s violation of Tachibana  “may not be harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt given the circumstances in this case” and that  
“it is not uncommon for convictions to be vacated as a result of 
deficient Tachibana  colloquies. ”  The State indicated that the 
situation was unfortunate given that the evidence showed that 
Eduwensuyi operated a vehicle under the influence of an 
intoxicant and that the dis trict court failed “to follow the 
simple mandates” of this court’s precedent.  The State concluded 
that it “believes the right to testify colloquy was deficient 
and thus a new trial is warranted.”  
  On June 9, 2017, the ICA entered a summary disposition 
order (SDO).4  In its SDO, the ICA did not reference that the 
State had acknowledged in its answering brief that both the 
district court’s pretrial advisement and the ultimate colloquy 
were deficient because the district court failed to advise  
Eduwensuyi of basic information require d by Tachibana .  The ICA 
also did not mention in its SDO that the State had conceded 
error in the conviction in this case.   
                     
 4 The ICA’s SDO can be found at State v. Eduwensuyi , 140 Hawai i 7, 
395 P.3d 1241 (App. June 9, 2017).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
9   T he ICA determined that, although the district court 
did not advise Eduwensuyi in the ultimate colloquy that no one 
could prevent him from testifying if he wanted to do so, the 
court adequately covered this advisement in the pretrial 
colloquy by advising him that he had a right to testify or not 
to testify and that it was ultimately his decision whether to 
testify.  The ICA further found that given the short time 
between the pretrial advisement and the ultimate colloquy,5 
Eduwensuyi’s acknowledgment that he understood his rights, and 
Eduwensuyi’s opportunity to further consult with his counsel 
prior to waiving the right to testify, the district court 
satisfied the requirements of Tachibana.  The ICA thus concluded 
that Eduwensuyi validly waived the right to testify and 
accordingly affirmed the district court’s judgment.  
III.  STANDARD OF REVIEW 
 
 The validity of  a criminal defendant’s waiver of the 
right to testify is a question of constitutional law reviewed by 
this court under the right/wrong standard.  State v. Gomez-
Lobato, 130 Hawai i 465, 468-69, 312 P.3d 897, 900 -01 (2013). 
                     
 5 The bench trial lasted fifty minutes.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
10 IV. DISCUSSION  
Hawaii law has historically protected both a 
defendant’s right to testify and right not to testify.  State v.  
Monteil, 134 Hawai i 361, 369, 341 P.3d 567, 575 (2014).  The 
right to testify is guaranteed by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments  
to the United States Constitution;  parallel  provisions contained 
in article I, sections 5, 10, and 14 of the Hawai i Constitution;  
and HRS § 801-2.  State v. Pomroy , 132 Hawaii 85, 91, 319 P.3d 
1093, 1099 (2014).  The right not to testify is protect ed by the 
United States Constitution’s  Fifth Amendment guarantee against 
compelled testimony and the Hawai i Constitution ’s counterpart 
provision under a rticle I, section 10.  Monteil , 134 Hawaii at 
369, 341 P.3d at 575. 
A key purpose of the Tachibana  colloquy is to protect 
a defendant’s right to testify.   Tachibana v. State , 79 Hawaii 
226, 236 , 900 P.2d 1293, 1303 (1995).  In Tachibana , this court 
declared as follows:  
Thus, we hold that in order to protect the right to testify 
under the Hawai ʻi Constitution, trial courts must advise 
criminal defendants of their right to testify and must 
obtain an on -the-record waiver of that right in every case 
in which the defendant does not testify.  
Id. (footnotes omitted).  Hence, trial courts are charged with 
the “serious and weighty responsibility” of ensuring that the 
waiver of the right to testify is a knowing and intelligent ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
11 decision.  Monteil , 134 Hawai i at 371, 341 P.3d at 577 (quoting 
Tachibana , 79 Hawai i at 233, 900 P.2d at 1300). 
  A defendant’s constitutional right to testify is 
violated when the Tachibana colloquy is inadequate to provide an 
“objective basis” for finding the defendant “knowingly, 
intelligently, and voluntarily” relinquished his or her right  to 
testify.  State v. Han , 130 Hawaii 83, 91, 306 P.3d 128, 136 
(2013).  In determining whether a waiver of the right to testify 
was voluntarily and intelligently 
made, this court looks  to the 
totality of the facts and circumstances of each particular case.  
Id. at 89, 306 P.3d at 134. 
A. The Tachibana  Colloquy Was Inadequate 
In its answering brief to the ICA, the State conceded 
that “the ultimate colloquy was . . . deficient in some 
respects” because, inter alia, “the district court failed to 
inform [Eduwensuyi] . . . that if he wants to testify that no 
one can prevent him from doing so.”  The State concluded that it 
“believes the right to testify colloquy was deficient and thus a 
new trial is warranted.”  Upon a review of the record and 
applicable law, the State’s concession of error was properly 
made.  See Territory v. Kogami , 37 Haw. 174, 175 (Haw. Terr. 
1945) (holding that, while a prosecutor’s confession of error is 
“entitled to great weight,” before a conviction is reversed, “it ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
12 is incumbent upon the appellate court to ascertain first that 
the confession of error is supported by the record and well-
founded in law and to determine that such error is properly 
preserved and prejudicial”).  
1. The district court did not advise Eduwensuyi that no one 
could prevent him from testifying.  
  
Under Tachibana, a defendant must be advised, inter 
alia, “that if he [or she] wants to testify that no one can 
prevent him [or her] from doing so.”   79 Hawaiʻi at 236 n.7, 900 
P.2d at 1303 n.7 (alterations in original) (quoting State v. 
Silva, 78 Hawai i 115, 122 –23, 890 P.2d 702, 709 –10 (App.  1995)).  
This advisement is critical.  See, e.g., Pomroy , 132 Hawaiʻi at 
92, 319 P.3d at 1100.  The Tachibana  colloquy was adopted  by 
this court as the procedure that would “best protect defen dants’ 
rights while maintaining the integrity of the criminal justice 
system.”  Tachibana , 79 Hawai ʻi at 234, 900 P.2d at 1301 .  This 
court recognized that “[m]any defendants are unaware that they 
have a constitutional right to testify which no one, not even 
their lawyer, may take away from them. ”  Id. (quoting Boyd v. 
United States , 586 A.2d 670, 677 (D.C. 1991)). 
In Pomroy , we held that the Tachibana  colloquy was 
“defective” in part because the court “did not fully advise [ the 
defendant] of his rights.”  132 Hawai ʻi at 92, 319 P.3d at 1100.  
As this court explained, ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
13 Although the district court advised [the defendant] that he 
had the right to testify on his behalf and that if he chose 
to testify, he would be subject to cross -examination by the 
State, the district court did not advise [the defendant]  
that he had the right not to testify and that no one can 
prevent him from testifying . 
Id. (emphases added).  Here, as in Pomroy , the district court 
failed to advise Eduwensuyi  that no one could prevent him  from 
testifying.6  This error was compounded by the court’s failure to 
inform Eduwensuyi during the ultimate colloquy that the decision 
regarding testifying was his to make.  Given that the advisement 
that no one can prevent the defendant from testifying is 
critical and the only Tachibana  advisement  that emphasizes that 
the waiver of the right to testify must be voluntary , the 
court’s Tachibana  colloquy was deficient.7 
                     
 6 The State also properly conceded that the district court did not 
advise Eduwensuyi during the ultimate colloquy that he had a right not to 
testify.  See Kogami, 37 Haw. at 175.  In Pomroy, this court held that “the 
district court did not advise [the defendant] that he had the right not to 
testify;” the district court merely stated, “If you choose not to testify, I 
cannot hold that against you.”  132 Hawai i at 92, 319 P.3d at 1100.  
Likewise, the district court here advised Eduwensuyi, “If you decide not to  
testify, the court -- I can’t hold it against you.”  Such an advisement is 
similarly flawed, since telling a defendant “[i]f you decide not to testify” 
is not equivalent to informing the defendant of the constitutional right not 
to testify. 
 7 The ICA appears to have similarly determined that the ultimate 
colloquy was deficient because it acknowledged that the district court 
neglected to advise Eduwensuyi that no one can prevent him from testifying.  
The ICA instead relied on, inter alia, the pretrial advisement to conclude 
that Eduwensuyi validly waived the right to testify.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
14 2. The pretrial advisement did not cure the deficiency of the 
ultimate colloquy.  
 
 The ICA relied on the pretrial advisement to support 
its conclusion that the ultimate colloquy was adequate.  In its 
answering brief, the State conceded that the pretrial advisement 
was deficient because the district court did not advise 
Eduwensuyi that if he decided not to testify, the court as the 
factfinder would not use that decision against him.  The State’s 
concession on this point was correct.  See  Kogami, 37 Haw. at 
175. 
  In State v. Lewis , this court mandated that trial 
courts administer a pretrial advisement to defendants:  
the trial courts “prior to the start of trial, [shall] (1) 
inform the defendant of his or her personal right to 
testify or not to testify and (2) alert the defendant that, 
if he or she has not testified by the end of the trial,  the 
court will briefly question him or her to ensure that the 
decision not to testify is the defendant’s own decision.”  
94 Hawaii 292, 297, 12 P.3d 1233, 1238 (2000) (alteration in 
original) (quoting Tachibana, 79 
Hawaiʻi at 237 n.9, 900 P.2d at 
1304 n.9).  To more fully protect the right not to testify, the 
court in Monteil  added a third requirement to the pretrial 
advisement.  134 Hawai i at 373, 341 P.3d at 579.  There, we held 
that trial courts must also advise defendants during the 
pretrial advisement that their exercise of the right not to 
testify may not be used by the factfinder to decide the case.  
Id.  The district court in this case was thus required to inform ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
15 Eduwensuyi during the pretrial advisement that if he decided not 
to testify, that decision would not be used against him.  Id.  
The court failed to advise Eduwensuyi accordingly, and therefore 
the pretrial advisement was deficient. 
  The district court also did not inform Eduwensuyi 
during the pretrial advisement that no one could prevent h im 
from testifying.  Thus, the pretrial advisement could not cure 
the deficiency of the ultimate colloquy, which likewise omitted 
this information.  The ICA nevertheless determined that, while 
the district court neglected to advise Eduwensuyi during the 
ultimate colloquy that no one could prevent him from testifying, 
the court did inform Eduwensuyi during the pretrial advisement 
that the decision whether to testify was ultimately his.  
However, an advisement that the decision whether to testify or 
not to testify is ultimately the defendant’s is not equivalent 
under our precedent to an advisement that no one can prevent the 
defendant from testifying. 
 
 In Pomroy , the district court advised the defendant 
during the ultimate colloquy, inter alia, that the decision to 
testify “is yours and yours alone.”  132 Hawaii at 92, 319 P.3d 
at 1100.  This court determined that the ultimate colloquy was 
defective in part because the district court did not advise 
Pomroy that no one could prevent him from testifying.  Id.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
16 Similarly, the district court here informed Eduwensuyi during 
the pretrial advisement that his counsel may advise him about 
whether or not to testify but that the decision regarding 
testifying was ultimately his.  T he court failed,  however, to 
inform Eduwensuyi during the ultimate colloquy that no one could 
prevent him from testifying.  Thus, the “district court 
incompletely followed Tachibana ’s directive.”  Pomroy, 132 
Hawaii at 92, 319 P.3d at 1100. 
3. The ICA’s reasons for concluding that the district court 
satisfied the requirements of Tachibana  are flawed. 
  In concluding that the district court satisfied the 
requirements of Tachibana , the ICA relied upon the fact that 
only a short time elapsed bet ween the district court’s pretrial 
advisement and the ultimate colloquy.  However, as discussed 
supra, the pretrial advisement did not include the advisory that 
was absent from the ultimate colloquy-- that no one could prevent 
Eduwensuyi from testifying if he wanted to do so. 
  A dditionally,  a general assumption that a trial of 
short duration means that the defendant will remember and 
carefully consider what was previously stated in a pretrial 
advisement is not a fact that can be judicially noticed.  
Indeed, the opposite may be true.  A trial, especially the 
commencement of the trial, is an event where a defendant may be ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
17 anxious or nervous and not listening effectively.8  In addition, 
it is questionable that a defendant would extrapolate from what 
the judge actually said--it’s your decision to testify or not to 
testify--to mean something in addition--that no one can prevent 
you from testifying.  Further , the ICA’s assumption based on the 
brevity of the trial builds upon a premise that the defendant is 
able to correctly recall a pretrial advisory at the end of 
trial.  This assumption treats all defendants alike in terms of 
their ability to understand and recall the initial advisory 
despite differences, for example, in education, proficiency in 
understanding, and courtroom experience.  It also does not 
account for what comes in between the pretrial advisement and 
the conclusion of trial: the evidence adduced at trial that may 
affect the defendant’s ability at the time of the ultimate 
colloquy to recall or focus upon a prior advisory.  Finally, the 
pretrial advisement notifies the defendant of the right to 
testify or not to testify but states that if the defendant has 
                     
 8 “A criminal proceeding is, at best, an anxious event for a 
defendant and his family.”  Sara K. Sorenson, Treating Defendants as 
Individuals , 78 N.D. L. Rev. 259, 260 (2002).  Courts have recognized in 
other contexts that events associated with a criminal accusation can cause a 
defendant to suffer from anxiety.  See, e.g., United States v. Henson , 945 
F.2d 430, 438 (1st Cir. 1991) (“[C]onsiderable anxiety normally attends t he 
initiation and pendency of criminal charges[.]”); State v. Wasson , 76 Hawai i 
415, 422, 879 P.2d 520, 527 (1994) (citing Barker v. Wingo , 407 U.S. 514, 533 
(1972)) (recognizing that the defendant, like most criminal defendants, 
suffered from anxious moments awaiting trial); Commonwealth v. Leate , 367 
Mass. 689, 694 (1975) (indicating that there is an assortment of pressures 
inherent in the situation where a defendant pleads guilty).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
18 not testified by the end of trial, the court will question the 
defendant later regarding the decision not to testify.  It is 
significant that the defendant is told that the pretrial 
advisement is preliminary in nature and that the subject matter 
will be addressed fully at a later point if the defendant 
chooses not to testify.9 
  Thus, to assume, as the ICA did, that a pretrial 
advisement can serve as a substitute for deficiencies in the 
ultimate colloquy based on the length of the trial is inherently 
problematic.  Instead, a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary 
waiver must be borne out by evaluating the facts and 
circumstances that are evidenced as to the particular defendant, 
Han, 130 Hawai i at 89, 306 P.3d at 134, and not based upon 
general assumptions of what a defendant would recall from a 
pretrial advisement-- as deduced from the length of a trial.10  
                     
 9 Further, the purpose of the pretrial advisement is not to make up 
for the inadequacies of the ultimate colloquy.  Rather, the pretrial 
advisement was implemented because it would have “the beneficial effect of 
limiting any post -conviction claim that a defendant testified in ignorance of 
his or her right not to testify,” State v. Lewis , 94 Hawai i 292, 297, 12 P.3d 
1233, 1238 (2000), and would lessen the risk that the ultimate colloquy would 
inadvertently affect the defendant’s right not to testify, Tachibana, 79 
Hawaii at 237 n.9, 900 P.2d at 1304 n.9.  
 10 Our analysis is not meant to indicate that a pretrial colloquy 
cannot be considered  as part of the totality of facts and circumstances  in an 
evaluation of whether a particular defendant’s waiver was knowing and 
voluntary. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
19   The ICA also relied on “Eduwensuyi’s acknowledgment of 
his understanding of his rights” at the conclusion of the 
colloquy.  However, as discussed, the ultimate colloquy was 
deficient in that the court did not advise Eduwensuyi that no 
one could prevent h im from testifying.  A defendant’s 
acknowledgment of an understanding of an incomplete colloquy 
cannot serve as a basis for a valid waiver of the right to 
testify.  Rather, a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver 
is demonstrated by a showing that the defendant was fully and 
accurately informed in accordance with the requirements of 
Tachibana  and that the defendant acknowledged an understanding 
of the advisements given.  See Monteil, 134 Hawai i at 371, 341 
P.3d at 577 (“[A] decision by a defendant not to testify should 
be based upon a defendant’s awareness of the ‘relevant 
circumstances and likely consequences’ of such a decision.” 
(quoting Brady v. United States , 397 U.S. 742, 748 (1970))). 
  Finally, as support for its conclusion that there was 
a valid waiver in this case, the ICA reasoned that Eduwensuyi 
was afforded the opportunity to-- and he actually did-- consult 
with defense counsel during the ultimate colloquy.  However, 
neither the basis of Eduwensuyi’s request to consult with 
counsel during the ultimate colloquy nor the nature of their 
conversation is known.   After Eduwensuyi consulted with his ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
20 counsel, the district court did not ask Eduwensuyi whether he 
had any questions regarding his rights to testify and not to 
testify, nor did the court ask whether speaking with counsel 
answered any questions that he might have had regarding those 
rights.  Instead, the court simply asked Eduwensuyi whether he 
wished to testify.  And based on the negative response from 
Eduwensuyi, the court found a knowing and intelligent waiver of 
that right.  Thus, there is nothing in the record that indicates 
that Eduwensuyi’s discussion with counsel enhanced his 
understanding of his constitutional rights, much less rectified  
the error in the court’s colloquy.  
 
 In addition, it is settled law that the duty to ensure 
that a defendant’s waiver of the right to testify is validly 
made is one that is imparted to a court.  “A court has a 
‘serious and weighty responsibility to determine whether’ a 
waiver of the right to testify is a knowing and intelligent 
decision.”  Monteil , 134 Hawai i at 371, 341 P.3d at 577 (quoting 
Tachibana , 79 Hawai i at 233, 900 P.2d at 1300).  Thus, a court 
may not rely upon an off- the-record di scussion between counsel 
and a defendant to establish a valid waiver of a constitutional 
right, and the ICA erred in doing so.  Cf. State v. Gomez-
Lobato, 130 Hawai i 465, 477 -78, 312 P.3d 897, 909- 10 (2013) 
(finding waiver of jury trial deficient in part because court ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
21 should have inquired as to defendant’s  understanding of jury 
trial waiver form that was  interpreted to him out of cou rt). 
 
 Based on the foregoing, the ICA’s reasons for 
concluding that the district court satisfied the requirements of 
Tachibana are flawed and cannot support a finding that 
Eduwensuyi validly waived the right to testify. 
B. The Court’s Error Was Not Harmless Beyond A Reasonable Doubt  
 
 The State acknowledged in its answering brief that the 
district court’s violation of Tachibana in this case “may not be 
harmless beyond a reasonable doubt given the circumstances,” 
concluding that it “believes the right to testify colloquy was 
deficient and thus a new trial is warranted.”  We find that the 
State’s concession on this point was proper.  See Kogami , 37 
Haw. at 175.  “Once a violation of the constitutional right to 
testify is established, the conviction must be vacated unless 
the State can prove that the violation was harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt.”  Tachibana , 79 Hawaiʻ i at 240, 900 P.2d at 
1307 (citations omitted).  “The relevant question under the 
harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard is whether there is 
a reasonable possibility  that error might have  contributed to 
[the] conviction.”  Han, 130 Hawai i at 93, 306 P.3d at 138 
(quoting State v. Schnabel, 127 Hawai i 432, 450, 279 P.3d 1237, 
1255 (2012)). ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
22   Had Eduwensuyi testified, he may have been able to 
contest the State’s case and shed light on whether he operated a 
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant in violation of HRS 
§ 291E-61(a)(1).  On this record, it is not knowable whether 
Eduwensuyi’s testimony would have had any effect on the outcome 
of his case.  Pomroy, 132 Hawaii at 94, 319 P.3d at 1102.  
Hence, it is “impossible  to conclude” that violating 
Eduwensuyi’s right to test ify was harmless beyond a reasonable 
doubt.  Tachibana , 79 Hawai i at 240, 900 P.2d at 1307; State v. 
Silva, 78 Hawai i 115, 126, 890 P.2d 702, 713 (App. 1995); 
Pomroy, 132 Hawai i at 94, 319 P.3d at 1102.11  Therefore, 
Eduwensuyi’s conviction must be vacat ed. 
C. The ICA Failed To Give Any Deference To The State’s 
Concessions Of Error  
  As noted supra, the State conceded in its answering 
brief that the pretrial advisement was deficient because the 
district court did not advise Eduwensuyi that his decision not 
to testify could not be used by the factfinder against him.  The 
State also conceded that the ultimate colloquy was deficient 
because “the district court failed to inform [Eduwensuyi] of 2 
of the 5 basic requirements of Tachibana, namely that if he 
                     
 11 Eduwensuyi also argues that the court did not engage in a true 
colloquy.  In light of the disposition in this case, we do not address this 
contention.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
23 wants to testify that no one can prevent him from doing so and 
that he has the right not to testify.”  The State further 
acknowledged that the district court’s violation of Tachibana  
“may not be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt given the 
circumstances in this case ” and concluded that it “believes the 
right to testify colloquy was deficient and thus a new trial is 
warranted.” 
  A prosecutor’s confession, although not binding on an 
appellate court, is “entitled to great weight.”  Territory v. 
Kogami, 37 Haw. 174, 175 (Haw. Terr. 1945); see also State v. 
Wasson, 76 Hawai i 415, 418, 879 P.2d 520, 523 (1994) 
(considering the State’s concession and concluding that the 
State properly conceded error); State v. Solomon , 107 Hawai i 
117, 127-28, 111 P.3d 12, 22-23 (2005) (recognizing the 
prosecutor’s confession of error and vacating the defendant’s 
conviction and remanding the case for a new change of plea 
hearing).  Thus, the ICA was required to consider the State’s 
concessions of error set forth in its answering brief.  However, 
nothing in the ICA’s decision indicates that the ICA gave due 
consideration to the State’s concessions in its evaluation of 
the issues presented in this case.12  See Kogami, 37 Haw. at 175; 
                     
 12 As stated, in Kogami, this court indicated that a prosecutor’s 
confession of error is “entitled to great weight.”  37 Haw. at  175.  We note 
 
(continued  . . .) ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
24 Wasson, 76 Hawai i at 418, 879 P.2d at 523; Solomon , 107 Hawai i 
at 127, 111 P.3d at 22.  
  As discussed, the State’s concessions are supported 
both by the record in this case and applicable legal principles.  
Under our well- settled law, while the ICA was not bound by the 
State’s concession s, the ICA was required to give due 
consideration to them.  Nonetheless, in light of the disposition 
reached in this case, we do not consider the effect of the ICA’s 
failure to give the requisite consideration to the State’s 
concessions. 
V. CONCLUSION  
  
The Tachibana colloquy was inadequate in that the 
district court did not advise Eduwensuyi during the ultimate 
colloquy that no one could prevent him from testifying.  This 
error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  Therefore, 
the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal and the district court’s judg ment 
                                                                               
(. . . continued)  
 
that the level of deference that would be accorded to a concession would 
depend on the issue presented.  For example, in Kogami, we found that a 
concession relating to the insufficiency of the evidence as to the charged 
violation of a statute was well- founded.  Id.  However, if the confession of 
error relates to an interpretation of a law, no deference need be given.  See 
Orloff v. Willoughby , 345 U.S. 83, 87 (1953) (“This Court, of course, is not 
bound to accept the Government’s concession t hat the courts below erred on a 
question of law.”).   Given the manifest deficiency of the Tachibana colloquy 
in this case and b ecause the ICA entirely failed to acknowledge the State’s 
concessions on appeal, we need not address the level of deference that the 
ICA should have accorded to the State’s confessions of error relating to the 
district court’s noncompliance with the Tachibana requirements.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
