OPINION OF THE COURT BY WILSON, J.   
I. INTRODUCTION 
This case involves the recovery of attorneys’ fees and 
costs by a plaintiff from a priva te defendant under the private 
attorney general (“PAG”) doctrine . 
Petitioners/Plaintiffs -Appellants Public Access Trails 
Hawaiʻi (“PATH”); David Brown; Joe Bertram, III; and Ken Schmitt 
(collectively “Petitioners”) prevailed against Respondent/ 
Defendant -Appellee Haleakalā  Ranch Company (“HRC”) in procuring 
a judgment from the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit 
(“circuit court”) that the State of Hawaiʻi (“State”), not HRC, 
owned a portion of Haleakalā  Trail that ran over HRC’s property. 
This appeal stems from Petitioners’ attempt to recover 
attorneys’ fees from HRC under the PAG doctrine. 
The PAG doctrine remains an essential tool for 
promoting the vindication of public rights . Because eligible 
plaintiffs may recover attorneys’ fees , the PAG doctrine enables 
litigation in the public’s interest by relieving otherwise 
prohibitive c osts and burdens assumed by individuals and pub lic 
interest groups . To date, the PAG doctrine has promoted 
litigation aimed at the preservation and conservation of            *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
Hawaii’s land and natural resources, as well as  litigation 
vindicating the rights of the Native Hawaiian community.   The 
viability of the PAG doctrine  hinges on plaintiffs being able to 
rely on the doctrine’s promise that they will receive reasonable 
compensation for their efforts  on behalf of the public. We hold 
that this promise translates into allowing plaintiffs  who 
recover attorneys’ f ees and costs under the PAG doctrine to also 
recover those fees and costs reasonably incurred in litigating 
their  initial claim for fees (“fees on fees”).      
 3  
 
   
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
  We also hold that a plaintiff may recover attorneys’ 
fees under the PAG doctrine from a private defendant even where 
the State voluntarily participate d as a co -litigant in the case. 
The State’s participation pursuant to a joint prosecution 
agreement , or other agreement to co -litigate , is not dispositive 
with respect to whether a plaintiff’s private enforcement 
efforts were necessary under the PAG doctrin e. 
Because the Intermediate Court of Appeals (“ICA”) held 
to the contrary, we vacate the ICA’s March 31, 2021 Judgment on 
Appeal and remand to the circuit court for proceedings 
consistent with this o pinion.

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
On January 18, 2011, Petitioners filed a complaint 
against HRC and William Ail ā, Jr., in his official capacity as 
the Director of the State of Hawaiʻi Department of Land and 
Natural Resources (“DLNR”) and Chair of the State of Hawaiʻi 
Board of Land and Natural Resources (“BLNR”) (hereinafter “the 
State”), seeking to restore public access to Haleakalā  Trail on 
the island of Maui.1 On March 31, 2011, the State filed a motion 
to dismiss the case , which HRC joined. The circuit court2 
entered an order denying in part and granting in part the 
State’s motion to dismiss .3 
a. Joint Prosecution Agreement Between Petitioners 
and the State 
On December 26, 2012, Petitioners and the State 
entered into a joint prosecution agreement (“JP A”), in which 
Petitioners and the State agreed to jointly prosecute Count III 
(claims under the Highways Act of 1892 and Hawaiʻi Revised 
Statutes (“HRS”) § 264-1 (2008 )) and Count IV (claim to quiet 
1 The Complaint consisted of: Count I (public trust ); Count 
II (customary and traditional access); Count III (Highways Act of 1892 and 
HRS § 264-1); Count IV (quiet title); Count V (public nuisance); Count VI 
(HRS § 6E -historic preservation); and Count VII (due process). Petitioners 
filed their Second A mended Complaint on August 30, 2013, which is 
substantively similar to their first Complaint, but was updated to reflect 
class certification and to identify the specific portion of Haleakalā Trail 
by an attached metes and bounds survey. 
2 The Honorable Joseph E. Cardoza presided. 
3 The circuit court denied Petitioners’ claims seeking 
declaratory relief under HRS chapter 669, under the Highways Act of 1892 and 
HRS § 264-1 (on the g rounds that those statutes did not create a private 
right of action), and under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.

   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
title) of the Petitioners’ original complaint. Petitioners 
agreed to dismiss without prejudice their claims against the 
State, and the State agreed to file a cross -claim against HRC 
asserting ownership of Haleakalā  Trail. 
The JP A stated, in relevant part, that the State 
shall: “at minimum, join with the [Petitioners] on substantive 
motions in Court against HRC with respect to the [JPA] , or join 
and support any appellate arguments” related to the JP A; 
“coordinate with [Petitioners] in the preparation of evidence 
for motions, evidentiary hearings, and/or trial against HRC on 
the [JPA]”; and “not object to any efforts by [Petitioners] to 
seek from HRC attorneys’ fees and costs of suit pursuant to the 
[PAG] doctrine, and/or as otherwise permitted by law[,]” should 
Petitioners prevail against HRC. The JPA also stated that “[a] 
Party’s sole remedy for a material breach [of the JPA] is to 
seek from the Court a return to the status quo befo re this 
Agreement was signed.” 
In joining Petitioners’ motion to the circuit court to 
approve the J PA, the State posited that although it “did not 
believe [Petitioners] could try title to property that 
[Petitioners] do not own or have an interest in[,]” be cause the 
circuit court disagreed, “the State necessarily supports 
[Petitioners’] position that the State, not HRC, owns the 
property.” The State declared that “ [Petitioners] and the State            
 
 6   
  
 
 
    
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
want the same outcome as to ownership of the property[,]” and 
noted that Petitioners “will continue to take the lead role in 
the litigation but benefit from State support.” 
On February 4, 2013, the court filed an order granting 
Petitioners’ motion to approve the JPA. Pursuant to the J PA, on 
March 6, 2013, the DLNR file d its cross -claim against HRC , and 
on March 27, 2013, the circuit court ordered all of Petitioners’ 
claims against the State dismissed without prejudice . 
b. Circuit Court’s Bifurcation Order 
On May 3, 2013, the circuit court ordered the trial 
bifurcated int o two phases. Phase one of trial consisted of (1) 
the State’s cross -claim against HRC to quiet title, (2) the 
public right of way element of Petitioners’ public nuisance 
claim against HRC, and (3) HRC’s cross -claim against the State , 
asserting that HRC wa s the sole and exclusive owner of Haleakalā 
Trail. 
c. Proposed Land Exchange Between the State and HRC 
In or about September 2013, HRC and the DLNR began 
negotiating a land exchange, in which the DLNR agreed to give up 
its interest in Haleakalā  Trail in excha nge for construction of 
a jeep trail on HRC property that would provide access to the 
State Forest Reserve. On November 14, 2013, Petitioners sent a 
letter to the BLNR voicing their concerns regarding the proposed 
land exchange and reiterating their posit ion that the State

 ATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
should focus on obtaining public access to Haleakalā  Trail. 
Petitioners asserted in their letter , among other things, that 
the “DLNR’s willingness to pursue the land exchange, or even to 
evaluate it” violated the terms of the JP A. On December 16, 
2013, Petitioners sent a similar letter to the BL NR, which urged 
the BLNR to defer placing the proposed land exchange on its 
agenda for consideration. On January 8, 2014, Petitioners sent 
a letter urging the BLNR to refrain from making a decision on 
the proposed land exchange at its upcoming meeting on January 
10, other than to approve further environmental and 
archeological review. At the BLNR’s January 10 meeting, the 
BLNR heard testimony from Petitioners, HRC, and State officials. 
The BLNR ultimately decided not to approve the land exchange , 
citing the need to collect more information about the 
environmental impact of such an exchange . 
d. Petitioners’ HRS § 607-14.5(c) Notice to HRC 
On October 24, 2013 , pursuant to HRS § 607-14.5(c) 
(2016 ),4 Petitioners sent a written letter to HRC requesting that 
4 HRS § 607-14.5(c) states: 
A party alleging that claims or defenses are frivolous may submit 
to the party asserting the claims or defenses a request for wi thdrawal of the 
frivolous claims or defenses, in writing, identifying those claims or 
defenses and the reasons they are believed to be frivolous. If the party 
withdraws the frivolous claims or defenses within a reasonable length of 
time, the court shall n ot award attorneys ’ fees and costs based on those 
claims or defenses under this section.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
HRC: (1) withdraw its frivolous claim s and defenses that it 
owned Haleakalā  Trail , (2) stipulate that the State owned 
Haleakalā  Trail, and (3) pay Petitioners $ 500,000.00  in 
attorneys ’ fees.5 On October 29, 2013, HRC sent back a two-
sentence rejection of Petitioners’ demand . 
e. Petitioners’ Motion for Summary Judgment on the 
Issue of State Ownership 
On November 20, 2013, Petitioners filed a motion for 
partial summary judgment (“MPSJ”) , alleging that there was no 
genuine dispute of material fact that the State owned in fee 
simple the portion of Haleakalā  Trail that fell wi thin HRC’s 
private property.6 
On December 11, 2013, at a hearing on Petitioners’ 
MPSJ, Petitioners argued that they had met their burden of 
showing that Haleakalā  Trail was “open, laid out, and built” by 
the State and that the State “never relinquished th e trail by 
due process of law.” Petitioners emphasized “that the location 
of the trail is not before the Court right now” and that they 
were “not asking the Court to determine that at this stage.” 
5 Petitioners state that “similar notice” was provided to HRC 
nearly eight months earlier on February 29, 2013. On February 26, 2013, PATH 
sent HRC an email counter ing several of HRC’s arguments that it owned the 
Trail, with supporting case law attached, stating that it “wanted to make 
sure HRC was aware of these cases before it continue[d] to trial.” 
6 In support of their MPSJ, Petitioners submitted the 
testimony of an expert trail witness opining that Haleakalā Trail was a trail 
“opened, laid out, and built” by the State for public use.            
 
 9  
 
  
  
  
 
   
 
  
  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The circuit court, however, in denying Petitioners’ MPSJ, 
pointed to the “good deal of discussion about the location” of 
Haleakalā  Trail , and stated, “I do think in this instance that 
location [of Haleakalā  Trail] is part and parcel of what would 
be required to create a record that could allow the Court to 
grant the motion.” 
f. State Support of Senate Bill 2728 
On January 17, 2014, State Senator J. Kalani English 
introduced Senate Bill 2728 (“S .B. 2728”) as a proposed 
amendment to the Highways Act, as codified at HRS § 264-1. S.B. 
2728, 27th Leg., Reg. Sess. ( Haw. 2014). S.B. 2728 , as 
originally introduced, stated that the legislature had the 
authority to “declare[]” public trails . Id. S.B. 2728 also 
included a provision making it retroactive to January 1, 2011, 
which would have effectively mooted Petitioners’ complaint, 
which was filed on January 18, 2011. Id. The DLNR submitted 
testimony stating that it “support[ed] the intent” of S.B. 2728 . 
Hearing on S.B. 2728 , S.D. 2, Before the H. Comm. on 
Transportation, 27th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Haw. 2014) (testimony of

2014) (testimony of William J. Ailā, Jr., Chairperson, BLNR). A 
subsequent draft of S.B. 2728 incorporated an amendment proposed 
by the DLNR that “subject[ed]” public trails to “being accepted 
by the [BLNR].” S.B. 2728, H.D. 1, 27th Leg., Reg. Sess. ( Haw. 
2014). Petitioners submitted testimony in opposition to S.B. 
2728 . Hearing on S.B. 2728, Before the S. Comm. on 
Transportation & Int’l Affairs, 27th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Haw. 
2014) (testimony of David Henderson Brown, PAT H). Ultimately, 
S.B.  2728 died in committee and was not enacted. 
2. Jury Trial on Phase One Issues 
On March 17, 2014, a jury trial commenced to determine 
the phase one issues.7 PATH, on behalf of Petitioners, and the 
State participated in the voir dire proc ess, and both delivered 
opening statements once the jury was empaneled. During trial, 
PATH performed the direct examination of Petitioners’ three 
expert witnesses: Anthony Crook (expert in surveying and 
mapping), Richard Stevens (expert in world history and trail 
research), and Doris Moana Rowland (expert in the Hawaiian 
islands, title research, and translation of Hawaiian documents). 
PATH also performed the cross -examination of the State’s expert 
witness, Patrick Cummins (expert in mapping and surveying of 
trails and roads in Hawaiʻi). PATH and the State delivered

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
closing arguments on April 22, 2014, and trial adjourned after 
five weeks on April 23, 2014. 
a. Circuit Court’s Judgment 
On December 19, 2014, the circuit court entered its 
judgment on phase on e of the jury trial. Consistent with the 
jury’s special verdict delivered on April 23, 2014 in favor of 
Petitioners , the circuit court declared and ordered , in relevant 
part, that: 
2. Haleakala Trail is a public right of way under the 
Highways Act of 189 2 by virtue of being opened, laid out, 
or built by the Government in 1905 . 
3. Haleakala Trail is a public right of way under the 
Highways Act of 1892 by virtue of being the successor trail 
to a trail in existence before 1892 . 
4. Haleakala Trail is a publi c right of way by virtue 
of being the successor trail to a trail in existence before 
the Mahele of 1848 . 
5. Haleakala Trail has not been abandoned by the 
Government by due process of law . 
6. The State owns Haleakala Trail in fee simple . 
8. Haleaka la Trail is a public right of way and 
therefore Plaintiff ’s[sic] have proven the first element of 
their public nuisance claim against [HRC]. 
3. Settlement Agreement 
On December 19, 2014, the same day the circuit court 
issued its phase one judgment, Petitione rs, the State, and HRC

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
mediated a settlement agreement (“Settlement”) .8 The handwritten 
Settlement states, in relevant part: 
The parties agree as follows: 
All claims in Phase I of the trial are final and 
nonappealable and HRC may not request a new trial. 
All claims for Phase II of the trial are dismissed with 
prejudice by Plaintiffs. 
The parties agree as follows with respect to 
Plaintiffs [sic] attorneys’ fees motion: 
- The motion will be heard by Judge Cardoza, whose 
decision may be appealed by either party[.]  
- HRC further agrees that it will not seek any form of 
land exchange of Haleakala Trail with the State.  
- Plaintiff’s[sic] motion for attorneys’ fees will be heard by Judge Cardoza in his courtroom in the normalcourse[.]  
 
The Settlement was signed by Petiti oners, the State, and HRC. 
4. Attorneys’ Fees 
a. For Phase One of the Trial 
1. Petitioners’ First AF Motion 
On December 16, 2014, Petitioners filed a “Motion for 
Attorneys’ Fees and Costs for Phase One of Trial ” (“first AF 
motion”) requesting attorneys’ fees in the amount of 
$1,108,915.30  and costs in the amount of $24,871.00  for a total 
of $ 1,133,786.30 pursuant to the PAG doctrine . Petitioners also 
requested that the circuit court issue written findings that (1) 
8 The copy of the Settlement in the record was submitted as 
Exhibit A of Petitioners’ March 2, 20 15 motion to the circuit court to 
approve the Settlement on behalf of the certified class members. Petitioners 
explain that the Settlement was redacted as to provisions pertaining to 
Petitioners’ first motion for attorneys’ fees, which was then -pending be fore 
the circuit court.            
 
 13    
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
“HRC failed to admit to the genuineness of docum ents and the 
truth of matters” during discovery, which “were later proved 
during phase one of the trial[,]” and (2) “HRC’s claim of 
private ownership of the Trail was made in bad faith[.]” 
Petitioners argued they were entitled to attorneys’ 
fees because they were a prevailing party and, pursuant to the 
PAG doctrine , “were solely responsible for vindicating [the] 
important public policy” of protecting Haleakalā  Trail under the 
Highways Act, which set an “important precedent” that may be 
used to “protect si milar historic trails and roads in Hawaiʻi for 
the benefit of current and future generations.” Petitioners 
argued that the circuit court should apply the PAG doctrine 
after considering the following three factors: “(1) the 
strength or societal importance of the public policy vindicated 
by the litigation, (2) the necessity for private enforcement and 
the magnitude of the resultant burden on the plaintiff, and (3) 
the number of people standing to benefit from the decision.” 
Honolulu Constr. & Draying Co. v . DLNR (Irwin Park II ), 130 
Hawaiʻi 306, 308, 310 P.3d 301, 303 (2013) . 
As to the first factor, Petitioners asserted that 
“protection and preservation of public and historic trails ... 
is a significant public policy .” Petitioners emphasized that 
even though the litigation “involved t he protection of [only] 
one historic trail ,” their verdict “st[ood] as a precedent that            
 
 14    
 
   
 
   
  
   
  
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
w[ould] further the ultimate goal of the [PAG] doctrine[.]” 
Petitioners pointed to a number of other “important public 
policies in addition to” the “protection and pre servation of 
historical trails,” which included confirming the scope of the 
Highways Act and clarifying a party’s right to bring a public 
nuisance action and/or an action under the Highways Act. 
As to the second factor of the PAG doctrine , 
Petitioners cited Irwin Park II in argu ing that even though the 
State participated in the litigation against HRC, Petitioners 
were “‘solely responsible’ for vindicating the State’s ownership 
of Haleakalā  Trail as a public right of way .” Irwin Park II , 
130 Hawaiʻi at 31 6, 310 P.3d at 311 . Petitioners emphasized the 
State’s failure to assert ownership or contest HRC’s claim of 
private ownership of the Trail dating back to 2003 , including 
the State’s 2007 actions “negotiating a memorandum of agreement 
[“MOA”] that gave un ilateral control of Haleakalā  Trail to HRC 
and failed to acknowledge State ownership .” Petitioners argued 
that “the State took the lead role in seeking” to have the ir 
2011 class action against HRC and the State dismissed. 
Petitioners claimed that even after the State entere d into the 
JPA and Petitioners dismissed their claims against the State , 
the State “still vigorously worked outside the courtroom to 
undermine” Petitioners, taking actions that would have severely 
damaged or mooted Petitioners’ case, including negotiating a            
 
 15   
  
 
  
  
   
 
  
 
  
    
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
land exchange with HRC and supporting the passage of S.B. 2728 . 
Petitioners also emphasized the lack of effort the State 
expended as a cross -claimant against HRC, and noted that 
Petitioners had assumed most of the costs and expenses of 
preparing for and arguing their case at trial. 
As to the third factor of the PAG doctrine , 
Petitioners argued that the litigation st ood to benefit a 
“significant” number of people, including , not only the people 
who use Haleakalā  Trail , but also anyone who seek s to prote ct 
other historic trails in Hawaiʻi under the Highways Act who may 
rely on this case as precedent. Thus, although Petitioners’ 
case involved only a single trail , Petitioners further relied on 
Irwin Park II in arguing that the case had a broad impact with 
“general precedential value for enforcing governmental adherence 
to the dedication of private land for public parks and as 
historic sites, and for the enforcement of the government’s 
commitments to the preservation of such parks and historic 
sites.” Irwin Park II , 130 Hawaiʻi at 319, 310 P.3d at 314 . 
Finally, Petitioners argued that they were entitled to 
attorneys’ fees because HRC’s claim of private ownership of 
Haleakalā  Trail was frivolous and maintained in bad faith . 
Petitioners asserted that under the “bad -faith except ion” to the 
rule that each party pays its own costs and fees, the circuit 
court had the “inherent power to curb abuses and promote a fair            
 
 16  
 
  
 
    
                     
     
 
  
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
process, including the power to impose sanctions in the form of 
attorneys’ fees for abusive litigation practices.” In re Water 
Use Permit Applications (Waiāhole  II), 96 Hawaiʻi 27, 29, 25 P.3d 
802, 804 (2001). Petitioners also claimed that, under HRS § 
607-14.5, the circuit court could award attorneys’ fees upon 
making a written finding that “all or a portion of the claims or 
defenses made by the party are frivolous and are not reasonably 
supported by the facts and the law[.]” HRS § 607 -14.5(b). 
Petitioners claimed that “on multiple occasions ,” as early as 
2007 and as recently as a notice letter sent on October 26, 2013 
pursuant to HRS § 607 -14.5, they inf ormed HRC that its claim of 
private ownership of Haleakalā  Trail had no basis in fact and 
requested HRC withdraw its claim.9 Petitioners asserted that HRC 
provided no rebuttal to these notices or requests. Petitioners 
noted that, in making its decision regarding attorneys’ fees, 
the circuit court could consider that notice, as contemplated in 
HRS § 607 -14.5, was provided to HRC. See HRS § 607 -14.5(b).10 
9 See supra section II.A.1.d. 
10 Petitioners also argued that pursuant to Hawaiʻi Rules of 
Civil Procedure (“HRCP”) 36 and 37(c), they were entitled to attorneys’ fees 
for HRC’s failure during discovery to admit the truth of certain matters and 
authenticity of certain documents that were later proven true and authentic, 
respectively, during trial . The circuit court agreed, and awarded 
Petitioners fees and costs on this basis. This argument is not before this 
court on appeal, and therefore, will not be discussed further.

To show that the attorneys’ fees sought were 
reasonable and necessarily incurred, Petitioners included their 
lodestar calculation for the period begin ning when HRC was 
served with their complaint on January 18, 2011, until the jury 
delivered its special verdict on April 23, 2014, for attorneys’ 
fees totaling $ 1,108,915.30.11 
2. HRC’s Opposition to Petitioners’ First AF 
Motion 
On February 6, 2015, HRC file d its opposition to 
Petitioners’ first AF motion. HRC disputed that Petitioners 
were a prevailing party when they did not prevail “on any of the 
Counts in the Complaint,” and only prevailed as to the first 
element of their public nuisance claim. HRC argu ed that the 
State, not Petitioners, w as the prevailing party because the 
State had “been awarded full relief on all elements of its 
[quiet title] claim.” To the extent that Petitioners’ and the 
State’s claims “involved identical proof,” HRC cited Fought & 
Co. v. Steel Eng’g & Erection, Inc. , 87 Hawaiʻi 37, 56, 951 P.2d 
487, 506 (1998) in contend ing that Petitioners had not shown 
“their services were not duplicative of the State’s work.” 
11 Petitioners also argued that the circuit court should award 
enhanced fees because counsel represented Petitioners on a contingency basis 
at a substantially discounted rate, and prepared for a long and complex jury 
trial, and because the issues involved in the litigation were “of great 
public interest[.]”

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
HRC argued that Petitioners failed to meet any of the 
three prongs re quired to claim fees under the PAG doctrine. HRC 
contended that Petitioners did not meet the first prong, which 
considers the strength of the public policy vindicated by the 
case, because the quiet title case did not further important 
public policy. HRC emphasized that Petitioners did not prevail 
on their historic preservation claim in phase one of the trial, 
and that their claim under the Highways Act was dismissed on 
summary judgment. HRC noted that HRS chapter 669, which governs 
quiet title cases, con tains no provision for attorneys’ fees, 
and claimed that “[i]t is well established in Hawaii law that no 
party to a quiet title case has a right to recover attorneys’ 
fees[.]” HRC argued that “[n]o Hawaii case has applied the [PAG 
doctrine] to rights or p ublic policies arising from statutory 
laws that have no provision for attorneys’ fees[,]” and that, 
because the State was not entitled to fees for prevailing on its 
quiet title claim, Petitioners were similarly “not entitled to 
such fees simply because the y assisted the State’s prosecution.” 
HRC contended that Petitioners did not meet the second 
prong under the PAG doctrine, which considers the necessity of 
private enforcement, because the State did not at any time 
“wholly abandon” or “actively oppose” Pe titioners’ cause . HRC 
asserted that Petitioners “mischaracterize[d] the history of 
this case” by claiming it was “forced” to file its 2011            
 
 19  
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
complaint because the State “abandoned” its ownership claim. 
HRC, citing a letter to Tom Pierce from Laura H. Thiel en, dated 
Mar. 12, 2008, countered that the State had communicated to 
Petitioners as early as 2008 that it believed its ownership 
claim to be “tenuous at best” and was looking to “explore and 
employ other methods and opportunities to provide public access” 
to Haleakalā  Trail. HRC argued that Petitioners 
mischaracterized the State’s 2006 communications and 2007 MOA 
with HRC, none of which conceded ownership of Haleakalā  Trail , 
and posited that the State’s proposed land exchange with HRC did 
not necessitate priv ate enforcement, but rather, furthered 
public policy that favors settlement over litigation. HRC 
contended that both the MOA and the proposed land exchange were 
within the scope of DLNR’s managerial discretion and were 
actions taken in the public interest . 
HRC argued that the State’s initial opposition to 
Petitioners’ complaint stemmed from the fact that the State 
believed that Petitioners did not have a say in how the State 
should expend its resources or resolve disputes. Moreover, HRC 
continued, given that HRC and the State both believe “that the 
MOA continues to govern public use of the trail,” the outcome of 
this case --“a 6 -foot wide trail that leads to the fence line of 
the National Park boundary, barring further travel” --was 
“outweighed by the mill ions of dollars of State and judicial            
 
 20    
   
  
 
                     
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
resources spent.” HRC stated that finding Petitioners’ efforts 
were necessary “amounts to a finding that a private party can 
substitute its judgment and interests for that of the State[.]” 
Moreover, HRC emphasized th at any need for private enforcement 
ended when the State entered into the JP A with Petitioners.12 
HRC argued that if Petitioners “believed the State was failing 
to meet its joint prosecution obligations,” their remedy was 
claiming a breach of the JPA. 
HRC contended that Petitioners did not meet the third 
prong under the PAG doctrine, which considers the number of 
people who benefit from the case, asserting that Petitioners 
were “not advocating for the public but for their own group’s 
rights[.]” HRC empha sized that Petitioners “were forced to 
narrow their class membership because [their] interests 
conflict[ed] with other portions of the public[,]” and, 
moreover, that the number of people who sought and were denied 
access to Haleakalā  Trail was “extremely s mall.” HRC stated : 
“It is simply disingenuous to suggest that quieting title to a 
6-foot wide trail leading to a fence line will have a 
significant impact on a significant number of people.” 
12 HRC contended that if the circuit court was persuaded that 
Petitioners were entitled to attorneys’ fees, Petitioners should only recover 
$244,576.00 , the fees accrued through December 26, 2012, the date the JPA was 
signed.

   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
HRC emphasized that the circuit court’s denial of 
Petitioners’ MPSJ, taken together with its denial of 
Petitioners ’ motion for judgment as a matter of law and the fact 
that the case proceeded before a jury, indicated that HRC’s 
ownership claim was not frivolous under HRS § 607-14.5. 
HRC rejected the amount of attor neys’ fees Petitioners 
requested in their motion as “unreasonable” and “inaccurate.”13 
HRC argued that Petitioners provided sloppy documentation of 
their counsel’s services, failed to provide certain 
documentation at all, used inappropriate billing methods (e.g., 
block and quarter hour billing), and requested fees for non -
compensable items. HRC contended that the requested billing 
rates of Petitioners’ counsel far exceeded what was reasonable 
and standard in the industry and in comparison to the rates 
charged by HRC’s own counsel. 
3. Petitioners’ Reply to HRC’s Opposition 
Petitioners filed a reply to HRC’s opposition 
memorandum on February 13, 2015. Petitioners countered HRC’s 
argument that they were not a prevailing party by noting they 
were successful in establishing that Haleakalā  Trail was a 
public right of way under the Highways Act. Petitioners 
13 HRC also objected to Petitioners ’ argument that fee 
enhancement was appropriate in this case, and noted that enhancement is 
limited to fees sought under fee -shifting statutes, not the PAG doctrine. 
See supra note 11.            
 
 22  
 
 
    
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
contended HRC “contorted” the circuit court’s March 18, 2014 
order , which dismissed Petitioners’ claim seeking relief under 
the Highways Act as a separate cause of action , but e xpressly 
left intact Petitioners’ ability to “seek conclusions of law and 
findings of fact that there is a public right of way” under the 
Highways Act. 
As to HRC’s arguments regarding the PAG doctrine, 
Petitioners disputed HRC’s claim that the litigation did not 
vindicate important public policy , emphasizing that the 
legislative effort to pass S.B. 2728 and amend the Highways Act 
evinced that this case was of great public interest and 
importance. Petitioners contended that HRC “misinterpret [ed]” 
Irwin Pa rk II , which held that the important public policy 
vindicated need not “be the subject of the litigation itself .” 
Irwin Park II , 130 Hawaiʻi at 315, 310 P.3d at 310 (emphasis in 
original) . Petitioners also disputed HRC’s claim that private 
enforcement wa s unnecessary. Petitioners argued that the 
State’s recognition of its legal obligation (e.g., its 
“recogni[tion] that it had a definite ownership interest in 
Haleakalā  Trail,” as evidenced by documents and legal opinions 
from 2000, 2004, and 2009) and its subsequent failure to act on 
that obligation necessitated private enforcement. Similarly, 
Petitioners argued, entering into a MOA that gave HRC 
“unilateral control and use of a public resource” constituted an            
 
 23  
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
abuse of discretion and a failure to meet the State’s legal 
obligation to assert ownership over Haleakalā  Trail. 
Petitioners argued that they were entitled to attorneys’ fees 
even after the date the JPA was entered into because they were 
“solely responsible” for the outcome of the case and “ but for 
[their ] effort there never would have been a first phase trial.” 
Irwin Park II , 130 Hawaiʻi at 317, 310 P.3d at 312 (emphasis in 
original) . Furthermore, Petitioners asserted that “on multiple 
occasions” they had communicated to the State their belief that 
the State was in “anticipatory breach” of the JPA . Finally, 
Petitioners disputed HRC’s claim that the case had “no public 
benefit[,]” arguing that the case “clarifie[d] not only the 
status of the property at issue [i.e., Haleakalā  Trail], but 
also the status of other similar public properties [i.e., oth er 
historic trails] .” Petitioners stated that another public 
benefit of the case is deterrence of “other private landowners 
who might have been inclined to deny public access to historic 
trails.” 
Petitioners persisted in their claim that HRC’s 
refusal t o concede private ownership of Haleakalā  Trail was in 
bad faith , and accused HRC of “us[ing] its significant financial 
resources and political connections to bully a small nonprofit 
into submission .” Petitioners objected to HRC’s assertion that 
Petitioners’ failure to prevail on summar y judgment was            
 
 24  
 
   
 
  
   
 
   
 
  
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
indicative that HRC’s ownership claim was not frivolous, 
explaining that the circuit court had emphasized it could not 
grant summary judgment because location of the trail was still 
unclear. 
4. February 18, 2015 Hearing on Petitioners’ 
First AF Motion 
The circuit court held a hearing on February 18, 2015 
on Petitioners’ first AF motion. The majority of the parties’ 
oral arguments hewed closely to their filings . The parties also 
debated over the applicability of this court’s opinion in Irwin 
Park II . Petitioners argued that their case was “closely on 
point” with Irwin Park II and Bitterroot River Protective Ass’n 
v. Bitterroot Conservation Dist. , 251 P.3d 131 ( Mont. 2010), a 
Montana supreme court case cited with approval in Irwin Park II . 
HRC responded that Irwin Park II was distinguishable from the 
present case because Irwin Park II involved a park that was 
formally designated as a historic place under HRS chapter 6E . 
HRC emphasized that, in Irwin Park II , the State wholly 
“abandoned its o bligation” to protect the park’s status as a 
historic place and “actively sought to have [it] changed from a 
park into a parking structure.” HRC contrasted the properties --
a registered historic place in Irwin Park II versus “a six -foot 
trail” here --and the State’s actions --actively seeking to turn 
the park into a parking lot in Irwin Park II versus entering            
 
 25   
 
   
 
    
 
  
  
 
   
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
into a JPA here --and concluded that Irwin Park II was simply not 
analogous . 
5. Circuit Court’s Oral Ruling and Order 
Granting in Part and Denying in Par t 
Petitioners’ First AF Motion 
On February 25, 2015, the circuit court announced its 
ruling granting in part and denying in part Petitioners’ first 
AF motion. The circuit court found that Petitioners were 
entitled to recover attorneys’ fees under the PAG doctrine 
because : the litigation “vindicated . . . the important public 
policy [of] preserving an ancient and unique historic site” ; 
Petitioners’ efforts were necessary given “the State’s initial 
reluctance to preserve the trail” and pursuance of a land 
exchange with HRC ; and increasing public access to Haleakalā  
Trail will “undoubtedly increase” the number of people who seek 
to use the Trail for recreation and who recognize the Trail’s 
“cultural value[.]” The circuit court held that Petitioners 
were not precluded from being considered a prevailing party just 
because their success in phase one of the trial represent ed only 
partial success in their overall case. 
The circuit court held that Petitioners were entitled 
only to attorneys’ fees and costs “until the time that 
[Petitioners] entered into a [JPA] with the State .” The circuit 
court reasoned that, given the State’s cooperation after the JPA            
 
 26  
    
  
 
 
     
  
                     
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
was entered into, it would be “inappropriate” to award costs and 
fees for that time period:  
Although at times, the joint relationship between the 
[Petitioners] and the State was not on a solid foundation, 
these parties continued with their [JPA] of the claims 
pursued during phase one of the trial. Under these 
circumstances, it is the Court’s view that it would be 
inappropriate to apply [PAG] doctrine beyond the date of 
the [JPA]. 
The circuit court found that the record did not 
support Petitioners’ contention that HRC’s private ownership 
claim was made and maintained in bad faith , and it did not order 
costs and fees on this basis . 
Consistent with its ruling, on March 4, 2015, the 
circuit court issued an order granting in part and denying in 
part Petitioners’ first AF motion, and specifying for which 
items HRC was required to pay Petitioners’ costs and fees.14 The 
circuit court ordered Petitioners to resubmit their request for 
attorneys’ fees and costs, stated that the parties could address 
the details of the requested fees in supplemental memoranda , and 
set a hearing at which to announce the award of costs and fees . 
6. Parties’ Supplemental Memoranda 
Pursuant to the circuit court’s March 4 Order, the 
parties filed additional  memoranda regarding the amount of 
14 The circuit court ordered HRC to pay Petitioners’ 
reasonable cost s and fees for Items 10, 11, 21, and 28 in Petitioners’ Second 
Request for Admissions, and Items 1, 4, 12, 19, 20, 27, 40, and 41 in 
Petitioners’ Third Request for Admissions.            
 
 27  
  
     
 
   
 
 
 
 
     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
attorneys’ fees and costs. Petitioners requested $396,031.01  in 
attorneys’ fees through March 4, 2013 (the dat e Petitioners 
claim the JPA became effective ) and $24,871.00  in costs . HRC 
requested the circuit court award Petitioners $120,852.00 in 
attorneys’ fees through December 26, 2012 (the date the JPA was 
signed) and $21,331.31  in costs . 
Petitioners noted th at since the circuit court did not 
specify a date through which they were entitled costs and fees , 
they should be awarded costs and fees through March 4, 2013, the 
date Petitioners alleged the JPA “became effective .” 
Petitioners emphasized that the circui t court preliminarily 
approved the JPA on February 4, 2013 , subject to a thirty -day 
objection period . Since no objection was filed, Petitioners 
concluded, the JPA became effective one month later, on March 4, 
2013, at which time the State “began to jointl y prosecute” the 
case by filing its cross -claim against HRC two days later on 
March 6, 2013 . HRC countered that Petitioners were entitled to 
costs and fees only through December 26, 2012, the date the JPA 
was signed. HRC contended that the December 26, 2 012 date most 
accurately reflected the circuit court’s plain language awarding 
Petitioners costs and fees through the date the JPA was “entered 
into” and the JPA’s plain language stating the JPA was “ entered 
on this 26 day of December, 2012[.]” (emphasis added).            
 
 28  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Petitioners argued their requested fees were 
reasonable and again attached their lodestar calculation . 
Petitioners objected to producing counsel’s retention contract 
and disputed that they were limited to recovering what they 
actually paid their counsel. HRC countered that, under HRCP 
Rule 54(d)(2)(B), the court may require the moving party to 
disclose the terms of its fee agreement, and argued that such an 
agreement would help the court determine the value of counsel’s 
services . Petitioners con tended that their requested rates were 
“consistent with the standard billing rates” reported that year 
in the Pacific Business News, and emphasized that HRC’s 
comparison to its own counsel’s rate was unhelpful. HRC 
countered that Pacific Business News rep ort was of limited use 
because it reported rates that ranged from $150.00 to $500.00 
per hour. 
Petitioners disputed that they failed to provide 
proper documentation to support their fee request and addressed 
items HRC claimed were non -compensable, includ ing: paralegal 
fees, photocopying, depositions, unsuccessful claims, quarter 
and block billing, and videography . HRC emphasized its (and the 
supreme court’s) concerns regarding block billing, and argued 
that block billing combined with Petitioners’ heavi ly redacted

time entries made it impossible to determine the reasonableness 
of Petitioners’ request.15 
7. Circuit Court’s Oral Ruling and Order 
Awarding Petitioners Attorneys’ Fees and 
Costs for Phase One of Trial 
On April 22, 2015, the circuit court issued an oral 
ruling awarding Petitioners attorneys’ fees and costs . The 
circuit court found that Petitioners were entitled to recover 
attorneys’ fees through December 26, 2012, the date the JPA was 
signed. The circuit court awarded Petitioners $227,560.52  in 
attorneys’ fees , broken down as follows: 526.3 hours at 
$275.00/hour for Mr. Pierce (totaling $ 144,732.50 ); 264.8 hours 
at $240.00/hour for Mr. Martin (totaling $ 63,552.00 ); 92.5 hours 
at $110.00/hour for paralegal work (totaling $ 10,175.00 ); plus 
general excise tax. 
The circuit court found that costs Petitioners 
incurred from photocopying, taking depositions, and videography 
were compensable, given the “unusual amount” of photocopying, 
“great importance” of the depositions, and that the video shown 
to the jury was “extremely important, [and] highly probative” of 
the issues. The circuit court also found that the costs and

that approved of a twenty percent reduction for specific block billed 
entries, see Gurrobat v. HTH Corp., 135 Hawaiʻi 128, 135, 346 P.3d 197, 204 
(2015) (citing Welch v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 480 F.3d 942, 948 (9th Cir. 
2007)) , HRC requested the circuit court reduce Petitioners’ block billed 
entries by twenty percent.            
 
 30  
  
  
   
  
 
 
  
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
fees Petitioners incurred pursuing “unsuccessful claims” were 
compensable, as the “claims created a set of circumstances that 
in part led to the State joining with” the Petitioners. The 
circuit court confirmed that Petitioners’ billing methods and 
redact ions did “not interfere[] with this Court’s ability to 
evaluate the sums due.” 
On May 19, 2015, the circuit court filed an order 
consistent with its oral ruling awarding Petitioners a total sum 
of $256,494.53 . 
b. For Litigation of Attorneys’ Fees (Fees on Fees) 
1. Petitioners’ Second AF Motion 
On May 6, 2015, Petitioners filed “[Petitioners ’] 
Second Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs for Phase One of 
Trial” (“second AF motion”) , requesting additional attorneys’ 
fees in the amount of $71,462.58 and costs in the amount of 
$905.06 for a total of $ 72,367.64 . Petitioners stated their 
second AF motion was warranted “considering the time, 
complexities, and difficulties” they faced litigating their 
first AF motion. Petitioners acknowledged that the circuit 
court only partially granted their first AF motion, and , 
accordingly, requested that the court award all of their 
requested costs and a minim um of fifty percent of request ed 
fees.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Petitioners cited multiple federal appellate decisions 
in support of their claim that courts have confirmed that “time 
reasonably devoted to obtaining attorneys’ fees is itself 
subject to an award of fees.”16 Petiti oners requested that the 
circuit court apply the hourly rates for counsel it had 
established as reasonable for their first AF motion to the 
present motion. Petitioners contended the additional hours they 
were requesting were reasonable given that their fi rst AF motion 
“was heavily disputed and litigated by HRC” and required two 
hearings. 
2. HRC’s Opposition to Petitioners’ Second AF 
Motion 
On June 16, 2015, HRC filed its opposition to 
Petitioners’ second AF motion. HRC argued that the circuit 
court should deny the second AF motion because it constituted “a 
breach of the intent and plain language of the parties’ final 
and executed [Settlement.]” HRC emphasized that settlements are 
meant to wind up and end litigation , and noted that the one-page 
length of th e Settlement here “show[ed] that the parties 
intended this process to be simple and expeditious.” HRC 
claimed that the language of the Settlement “expressly

anticipate [d]” only a single motion for fees and costs: “The 
parties agree as to follow s with res pect to [Petitioners ’] 
attorneys’ fees motion : The motion will be heard by Judge 
Cardoza, whose decision may be appealed by either party. . . . 
[Petitioners ’] motion for attorneys’ fees will be heard by Judge 
Cardoza in his courtroom in the normal course .”17 HRC posited 
that Petitioners “had more than enough opportunity to request 
and litigate their entitlement” to additional attorneys’ fees , 
and should have included a request for such fees in their first 
AF motion or in their supplemental memoranda. 
HRC argued that the circuit court should deny 
Petitioners’ second AF motion because it “ [c]ontravene [d] the 
[l]aw of the [c]ase [s]et [f]orth” in the circuit court’s order 
awarding Petitioners attorneys’ fees for phase one of trial , 
which state d that “[t]he t otal sum of attorneys’ fees, 
sanctions, and costs that HRC shall pay [Petitioners ] is 
$256,494.53 [.]” HRC asserted that only “cogent reasons” may 
support modifying the law of the case, see Wong v. City & C ounty 
of Honolulu , 66 Haw. 389, 396 , 665 P.2d 157, 162 (1983) , and 
that Petitioners’ second AF motion contained no such reasons to 
increase the sum awarded in the circuit court’s order. HRC also 
17 HRC also contended that under the canon of contractual 
interpretation expressio unius est exclusio alterius , the Settlement’s 
mention of one motion implied the exclusion of multiple or subsequent 
motions.

argued that Petitioners were judicially estopped from seeking 
additional fees and costs not contained in their first AF 
motion, which “represented to the Court that the pleadings 
contained the total sum of attorneys’ fees and costs . . . 
[sought] for Phase One of trial.” 
Finally, HRC argued that Petitioners’ second AF motion 
was unsupported by Hawaiʻi authority .18 HRC emphasized that 
Petitioners failed to cite any Hawaiʻi case law to support their 
second AF motion , and instead relied only on non -Hawaiʻi cases 
that interpreted specific statutes in awarding fees on fees. 
HRC also emphasized that none of the Hawaiʻi cases Petitioners 
cite d regarding the PAG doctrine state d that a party was 
entitled to fees on fees. 
3. Petitioners’ Reply to HRC’s Opposition 
Petitioners filed a reply to HRC’s opposition 
memorandum on June 19, 2015. Petitioners disputed HRC’s claim 
that their second AF motion was unsupported by authority, and 
stated that HRC “fail[ed] to provide an adequate reason why this 
18 HRC cited two Hawaiʻi cases in support of its claim that 
Plaintiffs were not entitled to fees on fees: Hawai‘i  Ventures, LLC v. Otaka, 
Inc. , 116 Hawaiʻi 465, 476 , 173 P.3d 1122, 1122 (2007)(stating that “services 
necessarily involved in preparing [fee] applications . . . and defending them 
are not compensable”); and County of Hawai‘i v. C&J Coupe Family Ltd. P’ship , 
124 Hawaiʻi 281 , 242 P.3d 1136 (2010) (limiting its award of fees on fees to

Court should not follow the overwhelming majority of courts” in 
awarding fees on fees. Petitioners conceded that there was no 
Hawaiʻi law on point, but emphasized that this only served to 
strengthen their reliance on law from the federal circuit and 
other state jurisdictions.19 Petitioners , citing Serrano v. 
Unruh (Serrano IV ), 652 P.2d 985, 997 (Cal. 1982), claimed that 
the “[g]enera l [r]ule” is to award fees on fees, including when 
attorneys’ fees are awarded pursuant to the PAG doctrine. 
Petitioners distinguished the two Hawaiʻi cases cited by HRC, 
noting that their very narrow scope --Hawai‘ i Ventures 
(receiverships ) and County of Hawai‘ i (cases under HRS § 101-27)-
-limited their significance and applicability in this case. 
Petitioners contended that HRC’s argument that their 
second AF motion was barred by the Settlemen t relie d on a 
“strained interpretation” of the Settlement’s us e of the 
singular (“motion” ) as opposed to the plural (“motions” ). 
Petitioners , citing TIG Inc. v. Smart Sch. , 401 F. Supp. 2d 
1334, 1344 (S.D. Fla. 2005) , argued that rules of construction 
19 Petitioners noted that HRC also relied on federal authority 
in its memorandum in opposition, citing to a United States Supreme Court 
case, Comm’r of INS v. Je an, 496 U.S. 154 (1990). Petitioners emphasized 
that though HRC cited Jean’s statement that “fee litigation should not result 
in a ‘second major litigation[,]’” the Supreme Court ultimately awarded fees 
on fees in the Jean case.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
hold that “[u]se of the singular generally includes the plural, 
unless it is clear that the parties intended otherwise .”20 
Petitioners posited that the law of the case doctrine 
and judicial estoppel were inapplicable here because the issue 
presented in the second AF motion --whether Petitioners were 
entitled to fees on fees --“has never been before ” or been 
“adjudicated” by the circuit court. Petitioners argued that 
there was no “represent ation” to the circuit court that the 
costs and fees requested in their first AF motion were a “total 
sum” that would preclude them fro m seeking additional fees 
spanning a different time frame. Petitioners explained that 
HRC’s law of the case and judicial estoppel argument s relied on 
a “strained interpretation” of the phrase “‘total sum’ of 
attorneys’ fees” in Petitioners’ first AF motio n and 
supplemental memoranda and the circuit court’s order. HRC, 
Petitioners argued, was “well aware” that Petitioners’ first AF 
motion sought a “total sum” only for the fees spent litigating 
the ownership issue. Finally, Petitioners argued that denying 
their second AF motion “would frustrate or nullify the goals of 
the PAG doctrine ” by “allow[ing] HRC to dilute or dissipate 
20 Petitioners also con tended that expressio unius exclusio 
alterius was not applicable here because that canon referred to different 
items of a similar kind, not items that are exactly the same.

[Petitioners ’] fee award by forcing [them] to defend their 
rightful fee claim through lengthy, uncompensated proceedings.” 
4. Circuit Court’s Oral Ruling and Order 
Denying Petitioners’ Second AF Motion 
On June 24, 2015, the circuit court held a hearing at 
which it heard brief oral argument from the parties on 
Petitioners’ second AF motion. Petitioners emphasized that they 
had “litigat ed heavily” the issue of whether they were entitled 
to attorneys’ fees under the PAG doctrine and believed that the 
instant litigation over fees on fees was “related [] to the 
whole entire issue [as] to whether or not [they] were entitled 
to any PAG fees.” 
The circuit court denied Petitioners’ second AF 
motion. The circuit court noted that there was “no Hawaii case 
law that’s directly on point here .” The circuit court stated 
that while the Settlement “contemplat[ed]” a motion for costs 
and fees, the lan guage of the Settlement “did not specifically 
address one way or the other whether a second motion for . . . 
fees” could be filed. In explaining its decision, the circuit 
court focused heavily on what it believed the parties 
“contemplated” in their Settle ment: 
Given the entire fact pattern here, I’m of the view that 
what the parties contemplated was a litigation over a 
motion for fees and costs, and . . . I’m of the view that
the appropriate ruling here would be to deny this motion. 
 
I am not suggesting tha t our appellate courts would view 
unfavorable a request for fees related to litigation over            
 
 37  
 
  
  
  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
fees and costs, but I am of the view that given the 
settlement agreement that was reached, that what was contemplated here was that there would be litigation, and 
there was considerable litigation, over the fees and costs 
as to whether they should be awarded and what that sum 
should be. I have ruled on that. We’ve had that fully litigated. I gave the parties the opportunity to further brief those issues, and in th e Court’s view, that brings 
the matter to a conclusion as it relates to fees and costs.
 
The circuit court clarified that the issue of whether a second 
AF motion was contemplated by the Settlement was not “the one and only issue ”,  but noted that it was a “distinguishing factor” 
from the case law presented by the parties.   The circuit court 
identified the PAG doctrine as another factor that distinguished 
this case from the 
Hawaiʻi case law cited by the parties.  
Consistent with its oral ruling, on July 13, 2015, the 
circuit court filed an order denying Petitioners’ second AF 
motion. On July 11, 2016, the circuit court entered a final 
judgment consistent with its prior rulings . 
B. ICA Proceedings 
On August 10, 2016, Petitioners filed a notice of 
appeal to the ICA . Petitioners stated they were appealing the 
circuit court’s: (1) March 4, 2015 order granting in part 
Petitioners ’ first AF motion; (2) May 19, 2015 order awarding 
Petitioners attorneys’ fees and costs ; (3) July 13, 2015 order 
denying Petitioners’ second AF motion; and (4) July 11, 2016 
final judgment.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
1. Petitioners’ Opening Brief 
Petitioners filed their Opening Brief (“OB”) on 
December 14, 2016 . Petitioners , repeating many of the arguments 
from their two AF motion s,21 argued that the circuit court erred 
by: holding that Petitioners were not entitled to attorneys’ 
fees after the date the JPA was signed under the PAG doctrine; 
denying Petitioners fees on fees; and holding that the record 
did not support a finding that HRC’s ownership claim was made in 
bad faith.22 Petitioners urged the ICA to reverse and remand 
Petitioners’ first AF motion and the circuit court’s award order 
(to the extent they denied fees after the date o f the JPA and 
under HRS § 607-14.5), and Petitioners’ second AF motion in its 
entirety. 
Petitioners repeated their argument that Irwin Park 
II, along with other persuasive case law cited in Irwin Park II , 
indicated that government involvement in a case d id not preclude 
a finding that private enforcement was necessary. Petitioners 
noted that private enforcement can be found to be necessary 
where the plaintiffs “‘bore the brunt of the litigation burden’ 
21 See supra sections II.A.4.a.1, 3 –4, 6, II.A.4. b.1, 3–4. 
22 Petitioners claime d that de novo review was warranted here 
as the circuit court “disregarded rules or principles of law” in deciding 
whether Petitioners were entitled to fees under the PAG doctrine and the 
construction of the parties’ Settlement. Petitioners claimed that t he clear 
error standard applied to the circuit court’s finding that HRC acted in good 
faith as that issue presented mixed questions of law and fact.            
 
 39   
  
  
  
    
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
and but for [their] efforts, ‘full relief would not h ave been 
granted[.]’” Bitterroot , 251 P.3d at 140. Petitioners asserted 
the circuit court “disregarded” Irwin Park II in holding that 
private enforcement became unnecessary when the State joined the 
litigation , and thus, that Petitioners were not entitle d to 
attorneys’ fee after the date of the JPA . Petitioners argued 
that , even after the JPA , they were the “main prosecutors” of 
the case and bore most of the litigation responsibilities : 
Among other things, Plaintiffs, without any assistance from 
the Stat e: (1) conducted all the historical research in 
the case, in a case that spanned a timeframe of 200 years; 
(2) determined the location of Haleakala Trail, including 
by conducting all site inspections; (3) prevailed in a 
number of discovery disputes agains t HRC; (4) conducted 
virtually all discovery against HRC . . . ; (5) conducted 
the HRCP Rule 30(b)(6) deposition of HRC; (6) conducted 
extensive title research; (7) prepared all of the 
voluminous exhibits for trial; (8) performed almost all 
legal research; (9) drafted most of the motions in limine 
and trial memoranda; (10) performed the direct examination 
of all key witnesses, including of all the experts . . . ; 
and (11) performed the cross -examination of HRC’s expert. 
Petitioners requested the ICA remand for the circuit court “to 
consider other factors in addition to the [JPA] in its analysis 
of the necessity of  private enforcement,” including w hether the 
State would have acted to assert public access to Haleakalā   
Trail without Petitioners’ efforts.  
Petitioners argued that the circuit court erred in 
denying fees on fees, contrary to the rule that the majority of
courts have adopted.   Petitioners contended that awarding fees 
on fees would advance the goals of the PAG doctrine  by             
 
 40  
 
 
  
   
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
encouraging private actors to vindicate important public 
interests  and reassuring them that  they will be recouped for 
their efforts. Petitioners,  citing  Serrano IV, 652 P.2d at 993 – 
94, emphasized  that fee litigation can be lengthy  and demanding,
and could discourage private actors from pursuing litigation to 
begin with.   Petitioners conceded there was no Hawaiʻi case law 
on point here, but urged  the ICA to expressly find  fees on fees  
recoverable , “including specifically in the context of the PAG 
doctrine.” Petitioners repeated their argument that the 
Settlement did not preclude them from filing more than one 
motion for attorneys’ fees, and that the Settlement’s use of the
singular (“motion”) included the plural (“motions”) because there is no indication the parties intended otherwise.   
 
Finally, Petitioners argued that HRC’s claim of 
private ownership was frivo lous and made in bad faith. 
Petitioners emphasized that HRC’s argumen t that its ownership 
was established by “the ‘absence of reservation’ in relevant 
deeds” was rejected by the circuit court as irrelevant and 
inadmissible at trial. 
2. HRC’s Answering Brie f 
HRC filed its Answering Brief (“AB”) on February 22, 
2017 and urged the ICA to deny Petitioners’ appeal . HRC,            
 
 41   
 
   
  
   
    
   
  
  
 
 
                     
     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
repeating many of its arguments from the proceedings before the 
circuit court,23 argued that the circuit court did not err in: 
finding that Petitioners’ enforcement was unnecessary beyond the 
date of the JPA, denying fees on fees, or finding that HRC’s 
ownership claim was not made in bad faith. 
HRC argued that because the PAG doctrine is an 
equitable rule, the appropriate standard of review i s abuse of 
discretion. See Irwin Park II , 130 Hawaiʻi at 313, 310 P.3d at 
316. HRC contended that the circuit court was best suited to 
“evaluate the circumstances, weigh the equities, and determine 
whether . . . [Petitioners] were ‘solely responsible’ fo r the 
litigation” and neither disregard ed the law nor abuse d its 
discretion in finding that Petitioners and the State jointly 
prosecuted the case. HRC repeated its argument that none of the 
State’s post -JPA actions constituted oppos ition to Petitioners ’ 
cause . HRC stated that “[t]he fact that [Petitioners] did not 
like the [proposed land exchange] does not change that” 
settlement is a valued public policy . Furthermore, HRC urged 
the ICA not to award fees on this basis as it “would incentivize 
third parti es acting under the [PAG] doctrine to oppose any and 
all settlement efforts in order to prolong the litigation and 
claim more fees.” 
23 See supra sections II.A.4.a. 2, 4, 6, II.A.4. b.2.            
 
 42  
  
 
  
 
   
 
   
  
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
HRC argued that the circuit court did not abuse its 
discretion in denying Petitioners fees on fees because their 
second A F motion was “wasteful and inefficient” and “violated 
the intent and express procedural framework” of the Settlement , 
which “controlled the wind -up of this litigation .” HRC repeated 
its argument that the Settlement contemplated only a single 
motion for at torneys’ fees and costs, and argued that “[h]ad the 
parties intended to allow [Petitioners] an open -ended number of 
opportunities to seek attorneys’ fees,” they could have drafted 
the Settlement as such. Even if the Settlement did not control, 
HRC argued , the second AF motion was “untimely and 
disorganized ,” and Petitioners should have included a request 
for all fees in their first AF motion. 
Finally, repeating its arguments from before the 
circuit court, HRC asserted that the circuit court did not 
clearly err in finding that HRC’s ownership claim was not made 
in bad faith , or abuse its discretion in denying Petitioners 
fees on this basis . 
3. Petitioners’ Reply 
Petitioners filed a reply on March 8, 2017. 
Petitioners claimed that HRC ’s arguments regarding “the 
necessity of private enforcement” prong of the PAG doctrine 
failed to acknowledge that private enforcement can be 
“necessary, even where other private and public parties join in            
 
 43  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the litigation, where ‘but for’ the efforts of the plaintiff, 
there would not have been a vindication of the public’s 
interest.” Petitioners also argued that HRC failed to 
distinguish Irwin Park II and claimed the “determinative factor” 
in that case was not the State’s agreement to co-litigate the 
case, but rather that “the pl aintiff’s efforts continued to be 
necessary” even after the State intervened. Petitioners argued 
that the JPA strengthened , not weakened, their argument in favor 
of necessity because the JPA established they “would not only be 
a necessary party, but would also be the lead party” in the 
case. 
Petitioners clarified that they were not challenging 
the circuit court’s findings of fact in applying the PAG 
doctrine, but rather the legal conclusion the court drew from 
these facts , i.e., the conclusion that attor neys’ fees were not 
warranted past the date of the JPA . Petitioners contended that, 
in light of Irwin Park II ’s holding, the circuit court failed to 
make findings of fact sufficient to “ deny PAG fees after the 
execution of the JPA” because “at minimum” it needed to find 
either “that the public’s interest in Haleakalā Trail would have 
been vindicated even without [Petitioners ’] efforts, or that 
[Petitioners ’] efforts were no longer necessary.” 
Petitioners asserted that HRC’s argument that the 
State’s prop osed land exchange with HRC did not constitute            
 
 44   
 
  
 
   
  
  
 
                     
   
    
 
  
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
adverse action “ignores the trial court’s finding of fact that 
the [ land exchange] necessitated private enforcement .”24 
Petitioners , citing Bitterroot , 251 P.3d at 140, further 
emphasized that the State’s supp ort of S.B. 2728 also 
constituted opposition because “detrimental legislative efforts 
are a relevant factor [to the PAG doctrine].” 
4. ICA’s Memorandum Opinion 
On February 26, 2021, the ICA published a memorandum 
opinion affirming the circuit court’s final judgment. The ICA 
found that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in 
denying Petitioners attorneys’ fees after the date of the JPA.25 
The ICA stated that the necessity prong of the PAG doctrine is 
met “where the government either ‘abandons’ or ‘ actively 
opposes’ the plaintiff’s cause such that the plaintiff is 
‘solely responsible’ for advocating the public interest.” The 
ICA validated the circuit court’s finding that the State ended 
its active opposition to Petitioners’ case upon signing the JPA 
and entering into a cooperative relationship with Petitioners . 
24 Petitioners quoted the circuit court’s determinati on that 
Petitioners’ “efforts to preserve the trail were necessary in light of the 
State’s . . . joint proposal with HRC to exchange the trail for another site 
of less importance”. 
25 The ICA noted that while it reviewed attorneys’ fees and 
costs award s for abuse of discretion, it reviewed de novo “whether the trial 
court disregarded rules or principles of law that arise” when applying the 
PAG doctrine. Irwin Park II , 130 Hawaiʻi at 313, 310 P.3d at 308.            
 
 45  
 
  
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Thus, the ICA reasoned that the circuit court “acted within its 
discretion” and “consistent with our precedent” in declining to 
award Petitioners attorneys’ fees after the date of the JPA. 
The ICA stated that Irwin Park II was distinguishable from the 
present case because, in that case, the State “actively opposed 
[the plaintiff’s] efforts to vindicate the public interest 
throughout the entirety of the litigation.” 130 Hawaiʻi at 316– 
17, 310 P.3d at 311 -12. In contrast, here, the ICA noted that 
the State only opposed Petitioners’ efforts until “the parties 
entered into a cooperative agreement to jointly prosecute their 
claims against the HRC.” The ICA also emphasized that, to the 
extent Petitioners believed the State was violating the JPA, 
Petitioners “never exercised [their] right to seek relief from 
the [c]ircuit [c]ourt.” 
The ICA held that the circuit court did not abuse its 
discretion in denying Petitioners fees on fee s because the 
Settlement “did not appear to contemplate [Petitioners’] 
subsequent request for attorneys’ fees.” In reviewing the plain 
language of the Settlement, the ICA noted the use of the 
singular “motion.” The ICA also reasoned that the record did 
not show that the parties contemplated additional attorneys’ 
fees motions upon entering into the Settlement . Specifically, 
the ICA noted that : on the date of the Settlement, December 19, 
2014, Petitioners had only filed their first AF motion, which            
 
 46  
 
 
 
 
 
    
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
made n o mention of additional fees beyond those requested in the 
motion; Petitioners’ second AF motion was filed nearly five 
months after the Settlement was signed; and when Petitioners 
first mentioned they would be requesting additional fees at an 
April 22, 201 5 hearing, HRC’s counsel stated it was “baffled” by 
such a request. 
Finally, the ICA held that the circuit court did not 
clearly err in declining to find HRC had maintained its 
ownership claim in bad faith. The ICA reasoned that “[a]lthough 
the record m ay indicate that HRC’s claim of ownership of the 
Haleakalā  Trail may have been weak or even without merit, we 
cannot say that the [c]ircuit [c]ourt clearly erred in 
determining there was not bad faith on the part of HRC in 
asserting its claim.” The ICA agre ed with HRC’s argument that 
the circuit court’s rulings denying Petitioners summary judgment 
and judgment as a matter of law “support[ed] the inference that 
HRC’s claim was not frivolous.” 
Given its conclusion that the circuit did not abuse 
its discretio n or commit clear error, the ICA affirmed the 
circuit court’s final judgment. 
C. Supreme Court Proceedings 
1. Petitioners’ Application for Writ of Certiorari 
Petitioners timely filed their application for a writ
of certiorari on May 28, 2021. Petitioners present four             
 
 47   
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
questions to this court: (1) whether, under the PAG doctrine, a
plaintiff may recover attorneys’ fees “from a private defendant 
also sued by a government entity ”  where the  “plaintiff provided 
necessary and significant services to the public and/or  . . . 
the government entity continued to actively oppose plaintiff’s 
cause”; (2) whether, under the PAG doctrine, a prevailing party 
is entitled to recover fees on fees; (3)  whether the use of the 
word “motion” (singular) “prevents a party from filing  a 
supplemental motion to the first” where it is unclear from the 
record that the parties intended such an interpretation; and (4)
whether a court clearly  errs  by  finding a party did not act in 
bad faith when (a) the  party was notified pursuant to HRS § 607-
14.5(c) that its claim was not supported by evidence or law, and(b) the court later ruled, “consistent with the prior notice, 
that the party in fact had no evidence or law in support of its claim.”   
 
 
Petitioners repeat many of the arguments from the ir 
filings before the circuit court and ICA. As to the PAG 
doctrine, Petitioners argue that the ICA gravely erred when it 
“disregarded the rules and principles of law set forth in Irwin 
Park II” and affirm ed the circuit court’s holding denying 
Petitioners att orneys’ fees after the date of the JPA . 
Petitioners emphasize the equitable nature of the PAG doctrine 
and argue that as Irwin Park II does not require plaintiffs to            
 
 48   
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
“assume the entire burden” of litigation to qualify for 
attorneys’ fees under the PAG doc trine, this court should not 
impose such a rule here. Petitioners warn that this  rule would 
“essentially requir[e] public interest groups to ‘go it alone’ 
or risk being denied attorneys’ fees, [ which] would be 
antagonistic to judicial efficiency[.]”  
Petitioners emphasize the ICA’s “fail[ure]” to 
recognize that this case present s “the relatively rare scenario” 
where a party seeks attorneys’ fees from a private defendant 
instead of from the State. The ICA stated that in Irwin Park 
II, unlike here, the nec essity prong of the PAG doctrine was met 
because the government entity “actively opposed” the plaintiff’s 
efforts “throughout the entirety of the litigation .” 
“Obviously,” Petitioners counter, “where litigation is solely 
against a government entity[,]” th e government “by default must 
be abandoning its duty or” actively opposing the plaintiffs. 
Thus, Petitioners contend, even though Irwin Park II did not 
expressly address the question of whether a party is entitled to 
attorneys’ fees under the PAG doctrine where it joins the State 
in litigation against a private defendant, nothing in Irwin Park 
II demand s that such “fees should be categorically barred.” 
Petitioners warn of negative consequences should this 
court adopt a rule requiring plaintiffs to “assu me the entire 
burden of the litigation”:            
 
 49  
 
    
  
 
 
   
  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Under this bright line rule, there could never  be an award
of attorneys’ fees under the PAG doctrine where a 
government entity joins in the prosecution of a private 
defendant, no matter the circumstances. Indeed, such a 
rule would even proscribe payment of attorneys’ fees where
the government entity provides minimal or inadequate representation, or where it continues to be adverse, as isthe case here. It would also chill efforts by public 
interest groups to seek opportunities with a government 
entity which, in turn, furthers judicial efficiency.   
 
 
Petitioners also contend the ICA erred by failing to address 
persuasive federal and state authority cited in Irwin Park II 
that were “directly on point” and supported the a rgument that 
Petitioners need not have assumed the entire burden of 
enforcement. Petitioners discuss Comm. to Defend Reprod. Rts. 
v. A Free Pregnancy Ctr. , in which a California appellate court 
found that federal case law showed that private parties were 
“not barred, by reason of the [government]’s participation 
therein , from recovering attorney fees ” so long as they 
“rendered necessary and significant services of value to the 
public.” 280 Cal. Rptr. 329, 334-35 (Cal. Ct. App. 1991) . 
Petitioners also reference Waiāhole  II--the case in which this 
court first considered the applicability of the PAG doctrine --
and Serrano v. Priest (Serrano III ), 569 P. 2d 1303 (Cal. 1977) --
a California case quoted at length in Waiāhole  II--noting that 
those cases implied that private enforcement may be necessary 
where the ”burden of enforcement is not . . . adequately 
carried” by the government. Waiāhole  II, 96 Hawaiʻi at 30, 25 
P.2d at 805 (emphasis added) (quoting Serrano III , 569 P.2d at            
 
 50  
 
 
   
    
  
 
  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
1313 -14). Petitioners also note th at the Irwin Park II court 
followed the Montana Supreme Court’s decision in Bitterroot , 
which found that “private enforcement continued to be necessary 
even where the government entity charged with the duty of 
enforcement jointly prosecuted the case with t he plaintiff .” 
Petitioners contend that the ICA “directly 
contradict s” this court’s decision in Sierra Club v. Dep’t of 
Transp. (Sierra Club II ), 120 Hawaiʻi 181, 202 P.3d 1226 (2009) , 
which held that the necessity prong of the PAG doctrine could be 
satisfied by showing that the State actively opposed or wholly 
abandoned the plaintiff’s cause. Petitioners emphasize the 
State’s actions negotiating a land exc hange with HRC and claim 
that the ICA “downplay[ed] this active opposition” on the basis 
that Petitioners should have sought relief under the JPA’s 
provision for material breach . Petitioners argue that as there 
was no indication the circuit court relied o n the JPA’s material 
breach provision in its ruling, the ICA, similarly, should not 
have relied on th is provision. Petitioners also contend the 
ICA’s holding “fails to view the [JPA] in its entirety” and 
“ignores any notion of judicial efficiency.” 
Peti tioners argue that the ICA also erred by affirming 
the circuit court’s deni al of their second AF motion. 
Petitioners assert the ICA failed to address federal and state 
law cited in their briefs, law that was particularly important            
 
 51  
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
as the circuit court in part denied the second AF motion because 
of a lack of relevant Hawaiʻ i case law. Petitioners also claim 
the ICA “mischaracterize[d]” the record in finding that the 
parties had not contemplated a second AF motion, and emphasize 
that the circuit court “expressly found that the issue of what 
the parties contemplated [wa]s unclear[.]” Petitioners conclude 
by reiterating their argument that this case “demands” a finding 
that HRC maintained its ownership claim in bad faith. 
Petitioners ask that the ICA’s memorandum opinion be reversed 
and the case remand ed to the circuit court . 
2. HRC’s Response 
HRC timely filed its response on June 28, 2021. HRC 
repeats many of its arguments from its AB and contends that the 
ICA followed the PAG doctrine in affirming the circuit court’s 
judgment. HRC argues that the ICA was correct in disting uishing 
Irwin Park II from the present case, and emphasizes that, in 
Irwin Park II , there were “no less than three governmental 
entities actively opposing the public cause.” HRC argues that 
the JPA “distinguishes this case from all of the cases that 
Petit ioner cites in which a private plaintiff claimed to be 
‘solely responsible’ for the litigation despite the government’s 
involvement.” Given the JPA, HRC reasons, Petitioners cannot 
reasonably claim they were “solely responsible” for the 
litigation or that the State opposed their cause. HRC again            
 
 52   
 
    
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
disputes that the proposed land exchange was “an act of active 
opposition” by the State , and cites Keahole Def. Coal., Inc. v. 
Bd. of Land & Nat. Res. in a rguing that it was an action 
aligning with Hawaii’s “‘stro ng public policy ’ favoring 
settlement.” 110 Hawaiʻi 419, 439 , 134 P.3d 585, 605 (2006) . 
HRC argues that although Petitioners’ application for 
cert “relies heavily” on Bitterroot , that “reliance is 
misplaced[.]” HRC posits that Bitterroot was cited in Irwin 
Park II primarily to support the argument that a discrete piece 
of property could implicate the public interest. HRC also 
argues that Bitterroot is distinguishable because the state 
agency in that case “had to be forced by the private party into 
the litigation and did not agree (in writing or otherwis e) to 
jointly prosecute the case” and did not appeal “the decision 
adverse to its interest[.]” HRC stresses that the PAG doctrine 
is an equitable doctrine “subject to the court’s equitable 
discretion .” HRC emphasizes that the private party in 
Bitterroot “initiated the action that implicated public rights 
and sought to extinguish those rights” , and differentiates HRC’s 
actions and motives in the present case , asserting that it 
appeared only “to defend its private rights in good faith.” 
3. Petitioners’ Reply 
Petitioners filed a reply on July 5, 2021. 
Petitioners argue that clarification from this court is needed            
 
 53  
  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
on (1) “whether joint prosecution with a government entity 
against a private defendant constitutes an absolute bar to any 
award of PAG fees . . . no  matter the circumstances” and (2) 
whether private plaintiffs seeking attorneys’ fees under the PAG
doctrine may recover fees on fees. Petitioners note that  
precedent from this court  is very limited  (and ultimately not 
dispositive) as to the first issue and nonexistent as to the 
second issue.   Thus, Petitioners assert that the case law 
“currently does not provide sufficient clarity for trial courts”
interpreting and applying the PAG doctrine, and urge this court 
to accept cert.   
 
III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Application for Writ of Certiorar i 
The acceptance or rejection of an application for a 
writ of certiorari is discretionary. HRS § 602 -59(a) (2016). 
Grounds for a writ of certiorari include “(1) [g]rave errors of 
law or of fact; or (2) obvious inconsisten cies in the decision 
of the intermediate appellate court with that of the supreme 
court, federal decisions, or its own decision, and the magnitude 
of those errors or inconsistencies dictating the need for 
further appeal.” HRS § 602 -59(b). 
B. Attorneys’ Fees Awards 
“Traditionally . . . an award of attorneys’ fees and 
costs is reviewed for abuse of discretion.” Irwin Park II , 130            
 
 54  
 
 
  
 
 
  
    
 
  
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Hawaiʻi at 313, 310 P.3d at 308. A trial court abuses its 
discretion when it “clearly exceed[s] the bounds of reason o r 
disregard[s ] rules or principles of law or practice to the 
substantial detriment of a party litigant.” Id. (quoting Maui 
Tomorrow v. Hawaiʻi, 110 Hawaiʻi 234, 242, 131 P.3d 517, 525 
(2006)). However, “we review de novo whether the trial court 
disregarded rules or p rinciples of law . . . in deciding whether 
or not a party satisfie[d] the three factors of the [PAG] 
doctrine.” Id. 
C. Contract Interpretation 
Interpretation and construction of a contract is 
reviewed de novo. Title Guar. Escrow Services, Inc. v. Wailea 
Resort Co. , 146 Hawaiʻi 34, 456 P.3d 107 (2019), reconsideration 
denied (Jan. 13, 2020) . 
D. Allegedly Frivolous Claims Under HRS § 607-14.5 
Under HRS § 607 -14.5, the circuit court may assess 
reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs against a party in a civil 
action “upon a specific finding that all or a portion of the 
party’s claim or defense was frivolous[.]” HRS § 607 -14.5(a). 
A trial court’s conclusion that a party’s claim or defense was 
made in good faith and was, therefore, not “frivolous” within 
the meaning of HRS § 607 -14.5 presents mixed questions of fact 
and law, and is subject to review for clear error. See Coll v. 
McCarthy , 72 Haw. 20, 28, 804 P.2d 881, 886 (1991). “A finding            
 
 55  
 
 
 
 
 
    
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
is clearly erroneous where the court is left with a firm and 
definite conviction that a mistak e has been committed.” Id. at 
28, 804 P.2d at 887. 
IV. DISCUSSION 
Petitioners’ cert application presents four questions:
(1) whether, under the PAG doctrine, Petitioners may recover 
attorneys’ fees from HRC, a private defendant, where Petitioners 
co-litigated  the case with the State against HRC pursuant to a 
JPA; (2)  whether, under the PAG doctrine, Petitioners are 
entitled to recover fees on fees; (3) whether the Settlement 
between Petitioners, HRC, and the State  precluded Petitioners 
from filing a second AF motion; and (4)  whether the circuit 
court clearly erred by finding that HRC’s ownership claim was not frivolous or maintained in bad faith under HRS §  607-14.5.   
As to the first question , because the State actively 
opposed Petitioners’ cause after the date of the JPA such that 
Petitioners were , for a time, solely responsible for advancing 
the public interest, the ICA erred in affirming the circuit 
court’s denial of attorneys’ fees past the date of the JPA. As 
to the second and third question s: becau se (1) Petitioners 
should be permitted to recover reasonable fees on fees awarded 
under the PAG doctrine , (2) the plain language of the Settlement 
does not bar Petitioners’ second AF motion, and (3) it is 
unclear what the parties intended and contemplated regarding fee            
 
 56   
  
 
   
  
  
  
    
 
  
  
 
 
 
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
litigation, the ICA erred in affirming the circuit court’s 
denial of Petitioners’ second AF motion. As to the last 
question, because Petitioners failed to show that HRC acted in 
bad faith, the ICA did not err in affirming the circuit court’s 
denial of attorneys’ fees under HRS § 607-14.5. 
A. The ICA Erred in Denying Petitioners Attorneys’ Fees After 
the Date of the JPA 
The ICA held that the circuit court acted within its 
discretion in denying Petitioners attorneys ’ fees under the PAG 
doctrine b eyond the date of the JPA. The ICA reasoned that 
“pursuant to the [ JPA], t he State was no longer abandoning or 
actively opposing [Petitioner s’] cause, and [ Petitioners ] were 
no longer ‘solely responsible’ for advocating the public 
interest .” Petitioners contend that they are entitled to 
attorneys’ fees after the date the JPA was signed because their 
continued efforts were necessary to vindicate the public 
interest, as the State continued to actively oppose their cause 
despite the JPA. Petitioners’ conten tions are supported by law 
and fact. Pursuant to Waiāhole  II, “the role played by the 
government” must be examined when analyzing the PAG doctrin e’s 
“necessity of private enforcement” prong . 96 Hawaiʻi at 32, 25 
P.3d at 807. Here, the circuit court disregarded relevant 
principles of law in determining that Petitioners’ post -JPA 
enforcement efforts were not necessary: namely, that the            
 
 57   
  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
State’s post -JPA conduct with respect to the proposed land 
exchange with HRC constituted “ activ e[] opposition []” to or 
“abandonment []” of Petitioners’ vindication of the p ublic 
interest. Id. at 31, 25 P.3d at 806. Because the ICA and the 
circuit court disregarded relevant principles of law in 
determining that Petitioners’ post -JPA enforcement efforts were 
not necessary , we reverse. Petitioners are entitled to 
attorneys’ fees for at least the time period during which the 
proposed land exchange was negotiated and considered by the 
State . 
Under the “American Rule,” “each party is responsible 
for paying his or her own litigation expenses.” Irwin Park II , 
130 Hawaiʻi at 308 , 310 P.3d at 303 (quoting Sierra Club II , 120 
Hawaiʻi at 218, 202 P.3d at 1263). The PAG doctrine is an 
equitable doctrine that functions as an exception to the 
American Rule. Sierra Club II , 120 Hawaiʻi at 218, 202 P.3d at 
1263 . To determine whether t he PAG doctrine applies, this court 
considers three factors: “(1) the strength or societal 
importance of the public policy vindicated by the litigation, 
(2) the necessity for private enforcement and the magnitude of 
the resultant burden on the plaintiff, [and] (3) the number of 
people standing to benefit from the decision.” Id. (quoting 
Maui Tomorrow , 110 Hawaiʻi at 244, 131 P.3d at 527). This case            
 
 58   
  
 
 
   
  
   
  
   
   
 
  
  
   
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
focuses on the second prong : whether Petitioners’ enforcement 
was necessary given the State’s participation under the JPA . 
In Waiāhole  II, this court concluded that the 
plaintiffs failed to satisfy the “necessity of private 
enforcement” prong of the PAG doctrine. 96 Hawaiʻi at 31, 25 
P.3d at 806. The court reasoned that because the plaintiffs 
were not “the sole representative of the vindicated public 
interest” and the government did not “abandon[]” or “actively 
oppose[]” their cause , the plaintiffs were not entitled to 
attorneys’ fees under the PAG doctrine . Id. The court 
emphasized that “[t]he relevant point ” was “not the extent of 
the [plaintiffs’] success on appeal, but, rather, the role 
played by the governmen t.” Id. at 32, 25 P.3d at 807. 
(emphasis added). The court also recognized that although it is 
the responsibility of government agencies and institution s to 
“represent the general public . . . and to ensure proper 
enforcement, for various reasons the bu rden of enforcement is 
not always adequately carried by [the government], rendering 
some sort of private action imperative.” Id. at 30, 25 P.3d at 
805 (quoting Serrano II I, 569 P.2d at 1313 –14). 
This court’s instruction in Waiāhole  II to focus on 
“the rol e played by the government ” applies here. Analysis of 
the State’s conduct --at least for the time period during which 
the State negotiated and advocated for the proposed land            
 
 59  
 
 
   
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
exchange --makes clear that even after the signing of the JPA, 
the burden of enfor cement fell disproportionately, and at times, 
solely, on Petitioners . Pursuant to the legal principles set 
forth below, Petitioners satisfy the second prong of the PAG 
doctrine because (1) the existence of a JPA is not dispositive 
on the issue of necessit y, and (2) because the proposed land 
exchange constituted active opposition and/or abandonment by the 
Stat e. 
1. The JPA Is Not Dispositive on the Issue of Necessity 
The existence of a JPA or other agreement by the State 
to co -litigate a case does not automat ically render a party’s 
private enforcement unnecessary. Irwin Park II is instructive 
on this point . While Irwin Park II did not involve a JPA or 
written agreement by the government to co -litigate , its holding 
does support the conclusion that the governm ent’s voluntary 
participation in litigation does not preclude a private 
plaintiff from recover ing attorneys’ fees under the PAG 
doctrine. 
In Irwin Park II , Aloha Tower Development Corporation 
(“ATDC”) , a government entity, filed a court petition to expun ge 
the deed restriction on Irwin Park --which had been formally 
designated as a historic place --that required the property to be 
maintained as a public park. 130 Hawaiʻi at 310, 310 P.3d at 
305. Scenic Hawaiʻi, a preservation non -profit, moved to

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
intervene in the case to advocate for keeping Irwin Park as a 
public park and prevent ATDC from turning the property into a 
parking structure . Id. The City and County of Hon olulu 
(“City”) moved to intervene a week after Scenic Hawaiʻi. Id. 
The City posited that preserv ing Irwin Park’s status as a public 
park fell within its obligation to “substantially advance 
legitimate public interests, including protecting and preserving 
open space” in urban areas. Id. at 311, 310 P.3d at 306. The 
City explained “that its intervention was proper because its 
interest was inadequately represented by the existing parties to 
the suit[,]” but acknowledged that Scenic Hawaiʻi “at least to 
the extent of preserving [Irwin] Park, [had] similar interests 
as the City.” Id. The court granted the City’s motion to 
intervene , and also ordered the State and the DLNR to appear in 
the case as parties in interest.26 Id. 
The court ultimately denied ATDC ’s petition and 
awarded Scenic Hawaiʻi attorneys’ fees pursuant to the PAG 
doctrine. Id. at 312, 310 P.3d at 307. On appeal, the ICA 
reversed the award of fees, holding that Scenic Hawaiʻi failed to 
meet the second prong of the PAG doctrine because they were not 
the “sole representative” o f the public interest and it was 
26 The State and the DLNR responded by suppor ting ATDC’s 
petition in favor of expungement. Id.            
 
 61  
 
 
  
    
  
  
 
     
 
 
 
 
  
     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
“unnecessary” for them to respond to ATDC’s petition given the 
appearances by the respondents to the petition and other persons 
with reversionary interests in the property , as well as the 
City’s intervention. In re Honolul u Const. & Draying Co. v. 
State , 129 Hawaiʻi 68, 75, 293 P.3d 141 , 148 (App. 2012) . This 
court reversed the ICA, stating that “a party representing the 
public interest along with other parties may still be ‘solely 
responsible’ for advocating the public interest, despite the 
fact that private part ies are named in the litigation.” Irwin 
Park II, 130 Hawaiʻi at 316, 310 P.3d at 311 (internal citation 
omitted). This court found persuasive the other private 
parties’ declarations that “but for” Scenic Hawaii’s efforts, 
“the private parties ‘may not ha ve thus participated in this 
litigation. ’” Id. at 317, 310 P.3d at 312. This court 
concluded that “had Scenic Hawaiʻi not moved to intervene, ATDC 
might very well have prevailed in the face of a lack of 
opposition[.]” Id. 
This court did not address what significance the 
City’s intervention posed in evaluating the necessity of Scenic 
Hawaii’s enforcement under the PAG doctrine , but noted that 
“Scenic Hawaiʻi maintain[ed] that the City, to some extent, rode 
[its] coattails . . . after the City’s interventi on in the 
suit.” Id. In a footnote, this court summarized the law in            
 
 62   
  
   
 
   
  
 
 
 
  
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
California, explaining that attorneys’ fees under the PAG 
doctrine are not proscribed “solely because the [government has] 
initiated a similar action” that has been consolidated with the 
plaintiffs ’ action. Id. at 317 n.12, 310 P.3d at 312 n.12 
(quoting Comm. to Defend , 280 Cal. Rptr. at 336, then citing In 
re State Water Res . Control Bd. Cases , 73 Cal. Rptr. 3d 842, 849 
(Cal. Ct. App. 2008) ). 
Along with the above -cited California law , Bitterroot , 
which the Irwin Park II court cited favorably for its analysis 
on the third prong of the PAG doctrine, also provides guidance 
in evaluating how the government’s participation in the case 
bears on a plaintiff’s entitlement to attorneys’ fees u nder the 
PAG doctrine. In Bitterroot , the Montana Supreme Court found 
that the plaintiff, a preservation non -profit, was entitled to 
attorneys’ fees under the PAG doctrine , despite a state agency’s 
participation as an involuntary plaintiff in the litigati on, for 
its efforts obtaining public access to a stream . 251 P.3d at 
139-140. The Montana Supreme Court noted that the agency’s 
involvement in the case --including its failure to “appeal the 
decision adverse to its interest” by the Bitterroot Conservation 
District that the stream was not a “natural stream” --“was hardly 
the usual effort by an agency seeking enforcement of the law.” 
Id. at 140. The Montana Supreme Court found that the plaintiff 
“alone raised and defended” the issue of whether the stream wa s            
 
 63  
  
  
 
  
  
 
   
 
 
  
 
    
 
 
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
a natural stream, and “but for” the plaintiff’s challenge, the 
adverse decision “may very well still stand.” Id. Thus, the 
Montana Supreme Court affirmed the trial court’s holding that 
because the plaintiff took the lead role in the case and “bore 
the brunt of the litigation burden ,” and because “full relief 
would not have been granted without its effort [,]” the plaintiff 
satisfied the second prong of the PAG doctrine, despite the 
government’s participation in the case. Id. 
In the present case , as in Irwin Park II (and 
Bitterroot ), “but for” Petitioners’ efforts, the outcome of the 
litigation --i.e., the State being declared owner of Haleakalā  
Trail --may not have materialized given the State’s efforts to 
approve the land exchange with HRC . 130 Hawaiʻi at 317, 310 P.3d 
at 312. And, as in Irwin Park II , had Petitioners not 
(1) instigated the present litigation, (2) negotiated a JPA with 
the State, and (3) vigorously prepared and led the litigation 
effort against HRC , HRC “might very well have prevailed in the 
face of a lack of opposition” from the State. Id. 
2. The Proposed Land Exchange Constituted Active 
Opposition and/or Abandonment 
The State contends that the proposed land exchange did
not constitute “active opposition” within the meaning of the PAG
doctrine.  However, it is clear that by pursuing a deal in which
the State agreed to surrender its interest in Haleakalā   Trail,  
 
            
 
 64   
   
 
 
   
   
    
 
  
   
    
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
after it had agreed to jointly prosecute Petitioners’ case by 
asserting an ownership claim against HRC, the State was actively 
oppos ing or abandoning Petitioners’ cause of preserving 
Haleakalā  Trail for the purpose of public access. Had the land 
exchange been finalized, the State would have given up title to 
Haleakalā  Trail , and control over the Trail would have remained 
with HRC, who had consistently denied public access to the 
Trail. 
Furthermore, the circuit court found in its order 
partially granting Petitioners’ first AF motion that 
Petitioners’ enforcement efforts were , in fact, “necessary in 
light of the State’s initial relucta nce to preserve the trail 
and its joint proposal with HRC to exchange the trail for 
another site of less importance .” (emphas es added). Despite 
finding that Petitioners’ actions were necessary in part because 
of the proposed land exchange, the circuit co urt awarded 
attorneys’ fees only up until the date of the JPA (December 26, 
2012) , even though the land exchange was proposed and negotiated 
after the date of the JPA (in or about September 2013) . In so 
doing, the circuit court disregarded the relevant pr inciple of 
law that active opposition by the State may render a plaintiff’s 
enforcement efforts necessary and warrant an award of attorneys’ 
fees under the PAG doctrine to cover such efforts. See Waiāhole  
II, 96 Hawaiʻi at 31, 25 P.3d at 806. Accordingly, the ICA erred            
 
 65  
  
   
  
 
 
    
  
                     
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
in affirming the circuit court’s holding that Petitioners were 
not entitled to any attorneys’ fees after the date of the JPA ; 
Petitioners are entitled to attorneys’ fees after the d ate of 
the JPA through at least the time period during which the State 
negotiat ed and advocated for the land exchange with HRC. 
While it is clear that the proposed land exchange 
constituted active opposition or abandonment within the meaning 
of the PAG doc trine, it is unclear whether the State’s other 
actions (e.g., supporting S.B. 2728 ) also rose to the level of 
active opposition or abandonment . Likewise, it is unclear 
whether the State’s actions in this case aligned with “the usual 
effort by an agency se eking enforcement of the law” or whether 
Petitioners “bore the brunt of the litigation burden”27 such that 
attorneys’ fees are warranted through the end of trial , despite 
the State’s role as a co -litigant. Bitterroot , 251 P.3d at 140. 
Although the circuit court found that the relationship between 
27 Petitioners claim that they “single -handedly prepared all 
the evidence for trial, drafted the vast majority of the motions in limine 
and trial memoranda and were solely responsible for the direct examin ation of 
all key witnesses.” (internal quotation marks omitted) Specifically, 
Petitioners contend that, without any assistance from the State, they: 
(1) conducted all the historical research in the case, in a case 
that spanned a timeframe of 200 years; (2) determined the location of 
Haleakala Trail, including by conducting all site inspections; (3) prevailed 
in a number of discovery disputes against HRC; (4) conducted virtually all 
discovery against HRC . . . ; (5) conducted the HRCP Rule 30(b)(6) depos ition 
of HRC; (6) conducted extensive title research; (7) prepared all of the 
voluminous exhibits for trial; (8) performed almost all legal research; (9) 
drafted most of the motions in limine and trial memoranda; (10) performed the 
direct examination of al l key witnesses, including of all the experts . . . ; 
and (11) performed the cross -examination of HRC’s expert.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Petitioners and the State w as not always “ on a solid foundation” 
after the JPA, it made no findings as to whether the State’s 
(1) support of S.B. 2728 constituted “active opposition” and 
(2) participat ion in prepa ration for and at trial rendered 
Petitioners’ enforcement efforts unnecessary. By a ddressing 
these questions on remand , the circuit court should determine to 
what extent Petitioners are entitled to post -JPA attorneys’ fees 
under the PAG doctrine . 
B. The ICA Erred in Affirming the Circuit Court’s Denial of 
Petitioners’ Second AF Motion 
Petitioners contend that the circuit court erred in 
denying their second AF motion . The ICA rejected this argument, 
holding that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in 
denying Petitioners’ second AF motion because the Settlement 
“did not appear to contemplate [Petitioners’] subsequent request 
for attorneys’ fees. ” The ICA erred in affirming the circuit 
court’s denial of Petitioners’ second AF motion because the 
plain language of the Settlement does not preclude motions 
subsequent to Petitioners’ first AF motion , and it is unclear 
what the parties contemplated with regard to further litigation 
over costs and fees . To the extent that the terms of the 
Settlement are amb iguous and intent of the parties is unclear, 
this case should be remanded to the circuit court. Moreover, as 
discussed infra in section IV.B.2, Petitioners’ attorneys’ fees

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
and costs recoverable under the PAG doctrine include those 
reasonably incurred in litigating the initial claim for fees. 
1. The Plain Language of the Settlement Did Not Preclud e 
Petitioners from Filing a Second AF Motion 
HRC argues that “[t]he express terms of the Settlement 
Agreement called for a single motion and barred [Petitioners’] 
attempt to file a second motion for attorneys’ fees.”28 
Petitioners disagree that the Settlement’s use of the singular 
“motion” precluded them from filing their second AF motion , and 
counter that, under the rules of contract interpretation, “the 
use of the singular generally includes the plural, unless it is 
clear that the parties intended otherwise.” The ICA found that 
the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in rendering a 
decision consistent with HRC’s argument. However, the ICA erred 
28 The redacted Settlement, in relevant part, reads: 
The parties agree as follows:  
All claims in Phase I of the trial are final and nonappeal able 
and HRC may not request a new trial.  
All claims for Phase II of the trial are dismissed with prejudice 
by Plaintiffs. 
The parties agree as follows with respect to Plaintiffs[sic] 
attorneys’ fees motion:  
- The motion will be heard by Judge Cardoza, whose decision may
be appealed by either party[.]   
- HRC further agrees that it will not seek any form of land 
exchange of Haleakala Trail with the State.  
- Plaintiff’s[sic] motion for attorneys’ fees will be heard by

because the plain language of the Settlement does not 
unambiguously preclude Petitioners from filing a second AF 
motion. 
Settlement agreements are contracts and are, thus, 
subject to principles of contract law. Exotics Hawaiʻi-Kona, 
Inc. v. E.I. Du Pont De Nemours & Co. , 116 Hawaiʻi 277, 288, 172 
P.3d 1021, 1032 (2007). “Under principles of contract 
interpretation, an agreement should be construed as a whole and 
its meaning determined from the entire context and not from any 
particular word, phrase, or clause.” Santiago v. Tanaka , 137 
Hawaiʻi 137, 155, 366 P.3d 612, 630 (2016). Contractual terms 
“should be interpreted according to their plain, ordinary, and 
accepted sense in common speech.” Id. And if those terms are 
“reasonably susceptible to more than one mean ing[,]” the court 
may deem the contract ambiguous. Hawaiian Ass’n of Seventh -Day 
Adventists v. Wong , 130 Hawaiʻi 36, 45, 305 P.3d 452, 461 (2013) . 
If a contract is ambiguous, the court may properly consider 
evidence beyond the four corners of the contrac t to determine 
“the intent of the parties and circumstances under which the 
agreement was executed.” Id. at 45–46, 305 P.3d at 461 –62; see 
also 29 Am. Jur. 2d Evidence § 1097 (2021). 
Considering the Settlement as a whole, the use of the 
term “attorneys’ f ees motion” is ambiguous because , in addition

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
to HRC’s interpretation, it can also be reasonably construed as 
setting forth the terms for one particular motion for attorneys’ 
fees (i.e., Petitioners’ first AF motion ), without establishing 
the terms for or precluding subsequent motions (e.g., 
Petitioners’ second AF motion ). Furthermore, t he language of 
the Settlement enumerates specific actions related to the 
litigation the parties are precluded from taking --for example, 
barring HRC from appeal ing the claim s adjudicated in phase one 
of the trial, request ing a new trial , or “seek [ing] any form of 
land exchange of Haleakala Trail with the State[,]” and barring 
Petitioners from bringing their phase two claims against HRC --
but does not expressly preclude Petitio ners from filing a second 
AF motion. 
HRC contends that the short length of the Settlement 
shows that the parties “intended [the litigation wind -up] 
process to be simple and expeditious [,]” which supports its 
argument that the Settlement bars Petitioners’ second AF motion. 
However, the short length of the Settlement, together with the 
fact that it is handwritten with numerous edits and corrections, 
and that it lack s any indication that it is a fully integrated 
document constitut ing the entire agreement be tween the parties , 
weigh s in favor of considering extrinsic evidence to resolve the 
Settlement’s ambiguous use of the term “attorneys’ fees motion.”            
 
 70  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Considering the circumstances under which the 
Settlement was executed also leads to a conclusion that the u se 
of the term “attorneys’ fees motion” is ambiguous. The 
Settlement was signed on December 19, 2014, the same day the 
circuit court entered its Judgment for phase one of trial. At 
that time, Petitioners had already filed their first AF motion , 
but litig ation on the motion did not begin in earnest until 
February 2015 . The circuit court partially granted Petitioners’ 
first AF motion on March 4, 2015 , and issued an oral ruling on 
April 22, 2015 specifying the fees and costs Petitioners were 
entitled to . Petitioners filed their second AF motion on May 6, 
2015, just two weeks after the circuit court issued its oral 
ruling on Petitioners’ first AF motion. 
HRC c laims that Petitioners’ second AF motion is 
“untimely” and that Petitioners should have included t heir 
request for additional fees in their first AF motion. This 
argument ignores the conditional nature of a request for fees on 
fees. Petitioners spent over five months litigating their 
(ultimately successful) claim for attorneys’ fees. Petitioners 
would not have filed their second AF motion if they had not 
prevailed on their first AF motion, and the substance of their 
second AF motion (i.e., the amount of costs and fees requested) 
depended heavily on the nature of the litigation of their first 
AF motio n. Petitioners could have, in theory, included in their            
 
 71    
   
  
 
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
first AF motion a  conditional request for fees on fees. But 
Petitioners could not have known, back in December 2014, the 
time they would spend or monetary amount they would incur 
litigating their first AF motion.   To that extent, a request for 
fees on fees in their first AF motion  could easily have been 
dismissed as unripe, incomplete, or unreasonable.    
Given that the express terms of the Settlement do not 
unambiguously preclude Petitioners’ second AF motion, the issue 
of what the parties contemplated regarding further fee 
litigation should be remanded for the circuit court’s 
consideration. The circuit court should consider all relevant 
extrinsic evidence, including that this fee litigation was 
brou ght in the context of the PAG doctrine, an equitable 
doctrine aimed at encouraging --and fairly compensating --private 
parties to vindicate the public interest. See Waiāhole  II, 96 
Hawaiʻi at 30, 25 P.3d at 805. 
2. Fees Recoverable Under the PAG Doctrine Include Those 
Reasonably Incurred in Litigating the Initial Claim 
for Fees 
Petitioners argue that while there is no Hawaiʻi case 
law on point, the “overwhelming majori ty of courts” award fees 
on fees in the context of the PAG doctrine , and that this rule 
aligns with the policy goals of the PAG doctrine. Serrano IV , 
652 P.2d at 997. Petitioners explain, as the California Supreme 
Court articulated in Serrano IV , that the PAG doctrine will                                 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
  
 
  
 
   
 
    
 “often be frustrated” or “nullified, if [fee] awards are diluted
or dissipated by lengthy, uncompensated proceedings to fix or 
defend a rightful fee claim.” 652 P.2d at 992. HRC does not 
dispute Petitioners’ argument, but counters  that even if this 
court were to allow PAG plaintiffs to collect fees on fees, 
Petitioners would not be eligible for such an award because 
their second fee request was “inflated, unorganized, untimely, 
improperly documented, overreaching, or otherwise unreason able.”
HRC’s argument is without merit. For the reasons set forth 
herein, we now clarify that  (1)  fees and costs awarded pursuant 
to  the PAG doctrine include those reasonably incurred in 
litigating the initial claim for fees, and (2) Petitioners are 
eligible to recover fees on fees.   
 
This court’s rationale in adopting the PAG doctrine , 
as set forth across Waiāhole  II, Sierra Club II , and Irwin Park 
II, favors permitting the awarding of fees on fees.29 We first 
considered and summarized the arguments in f avor of the PAG 
doctrine in Waiāhole  II, but ultimately held that it was not 
applicable to the case before us. 96 Hawaiʻi at 32, 25 P.3d at 
807. We quoted the California Supreme Court at length, stating 
that, in cases where a private plaintiff has carrie d the 
29 Unlike California, which has codified the PAG doctrine, see 
Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 1021.5 , in Hawaiʻi the PAG doctrine is wholly 
judicially imposed, see, e.g. , Sierra Club II , 120 Hawaiʻi at 218, 202 P.3d at 
1263.

enforcement burden that has otherwise belonged to the 
government, “[o]ne solution . . . within the equitable powers of 
the judiciary to provide, is the award of substantial attorneys 
[sic] fees to those public -interest litigants and their 
attorneys . . . who are successful in such cases, to the end 
that support may be provided for the representation of interests 
of similar character in future litigation.” Id. at 30, 25 P.3d 
at 805 (quoting Serrano III , 569 P.2d at 1313 –14 (emphasis 
added) ). “[S]ubstantial” attorneys’ fees are justified in cases 
where a private plaintiff assumes the government’s enforcement 
burden because such cases are “of enormous significance to the 
society as a whole” and often involve “extremely complex” issues 
that require “time -consuming and costly” presentation . Id. In 
short, we stated, “the purpose of the [PAG] doctrine is to 
promote vindication of important public rights.” Id. (quoting 
Arnold v. Dep’t of Health Servs. , 775 P.2d 521, 537 (Ariz. 
1989) ). 
In Sierra Club II , we award ed attorneys’ fees under 
the PAG doctrine for the first time to plaintiffs who procured a 
permanent injunction against an inter -island ferry project while 
an environmental assessment was being prepared. 120 Hawaiʻi at 
189–90, 202 P.3d at 1234 –35. In imposing attorneys’ fees 
against both the public (Department of Transportation) and 
private ( Hawaiʻi Superferry, Inc.) entities in the case , we            
 
 74    
  
 
   
 
 
  
    
  
 
      *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
explained that we “s[aw] no reason not to apply the [PAG] 
doctrine to a private defendant.” Id. at 225, 202 P .3d at 1270. 
We quoted the Arizona Court of Appeals at length, articulating 
why it was appropriate to apply the PAG doctrine in this 
instance: “[W]e do not find that the exclusive purpose of the 
[PAG] doctrine is to impose the cost of vindicating public 
rights on the public itself. Awarding [attorney’s [sic] ] fees 
against private defendants in appropriate cases will promote 
important public rights to the same extent as awarding fees 
against governmental defendants.” Id. (quoting Ariz. Ctr. For 
Law in th e Pub. Interest v. Hassell , 837 P.2d 158, 173 (Ariz. 
Ct. App. 1991). 
Finally, in Irwin Park II , we discussed the importance 
of the “general precedential value ” of litigation brought under 
the PAG doctrine . 130 Hawaiʻi at 31 9, 310 P.3d at 31 4. In Irwin 
Park II, we noted that while the litigation “concerned a 
specific property, . . . the result vindicated the dedication of 
public parks and historic sites across the state [,]” id. at 318, 
310 P.3d at 313, and ensured the future “enforcement of the 
government’ s commitments to the preservation of such parks and 
historic sites [.]” Id. at 31 9, 310 P.3d at 31 4. See also , 
Waiāhole  II, 96 Hawaiʻi at 31, 25 P.3d at 806 (noting that “all 
of the citizens of the state, present and future, stood to            
 
 75   
 
 
 
  
   
  
  
   
  
 
   
 
  
     
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
benefit from the decision”). This court thus adopted the PAG 
doctrine to promote the vindication of public rights. 
Allowing fees on fees in the PAG context is entirely 
consistent with the purpose of vindicating public rights, as 
precluding fees on fees would have a chilling effect on vital 
public interest litigation . W e agree with the warning set forth 
in Serrano IV that the PAG doct rine w ould be “nullified” if fee 
awards are “diluted or dissipated by lengthy, uncompensated 
proceedings to fix or defend a rightful fee claim.” 652 P.2d at 
992. Our considerations regarding the PAG doctrine in Waiāhole  
II, Sierra Club II , and Irwin Park II thus favor permitting 
plaintiffs to recover reasonable fees on those fees awarded 
under the PAG doctrine. 
In the present case, the issues were complex, 
requiring exceptional historical and title research, 
calculations to determine the location and bounds of Haleakalā  
Trail, and numerous physical site inspections. See Waiāhole  II, 
96 Hawaiʻi at 30, 25 P.3d at 805. The litigation was also 
lengthy, beginning in January 2011 (when Petitioners filed their 
compla int) and extending through May 2015 (when the circuit 
court granted Petitioners’ first AF motion) . See id. Finally, 
in procuring a judgment that the State owned Haleakalā  Trail (in 
and of itself a culturally and historically important trail) , 
Petitioners established important general precedent for future            
 
 76   
 
 
  
  
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
parties who may seek to vindicate other historic trails or 
rights of way under the Highways Act . See Irwin Park II , 130 
Hawaiʻi at 319, 310 P.3d at 314. 
Given the Petitioners’ success in the underlying 
litigation and on their first AF motion under the PAG doctrine, 
and given the policy goals this court has articulated in 
adopting and applying the PAG doctrine, we now clarify that 
Petitioners’ attorneys’ fees and costs recoverable under the PAG 
doctrine include those reasonably incurred in litigating the 
initial fee claim . Therefore, the ICA erred in affirming the 
circuit court ’s denial of Petitioners’ second AF motion. 
C. The ICA Did Not Err in Finding that HRC Did Not Act in Bad 
Faith 
Petitioners conte nd that because they notified HRC, 
pursuant to HRS § 607-14.5(c), that there was no law or evidence 
supporting HRC’s claim that it owned Haleakalā  Trail, and 
because the circuit court later entered a judgment “consistent ” 
with this notice, the circuit cour t (1) clearly erred by finding 
that HRC had not maintained its ownership claim in bad faith and 
(2) abused its discretion in denying Petitioners attorneys’ fees 
under HRS § 607-14.5 . HRC counters that this argument is akin 
to claiming that HRC “acted in b ad faith by defending its case 
at all.” The ICA affirmed the circuit court’s finding that            
 
 77   
 
 
 
  
 
    
   
 
 
 
   
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
HRC’s claim was not frivolous or made in bad faith. The ICA did 
not err in affirming the circuit court. 
Separate from attorneys’ fees entered under the PAG 
doctrine , the circuit court may impose “a reasonable sum for 
attorneys’ fees and costs” against a party to a civil action 
under HRS § 607-14.5 “ upon a specific finding that all or a 
portion of the party’s claim or defense was frivolous [,]” HRS 
§ 607-14.5(a), and “not reasonably supported by the facts and 
the law in the civil action[,]” HRS § 607-14.5(b) . A frivolous 
claim or defense is one that is “ so manifestly and palpably 
without merit, so as to indicate bad faith on the [pleader’s] 
part such that argument to t he court was not required.” Tagupa 
v. VIPDesk , 135 Hawaiʻi 468, 479, 353 P.3d 1010, 1021 (2015) 
(quoting McCarthy , 72 Haw. at 29–30, 804 P.2d at 887). We have 
clarified that “[a] finding of frivolousness is a high bar; it 
is not enough that a claim be wi thout merit[.]” Id. 
As evidence of HRC’s bad faith, Petitioners emphasize 
that when they provided HRS § 607-14.5(c) notice to HRC, which 
“thoroughly discuss[ed]” the reasons HRC’s ownership claim was 
not supported by law or fact, HRC responded with a “o ne sentence 
rejection[.]” Petitioners also claim that the circuit court’s 
phase one judgment was “entirely consistent with the prior 
notice.” Even taking everything Petitioners claim as true, all 
this shows is that HRC’s ownership claim was “weak” or “ without            *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
    
   
   
   
 
     /s/ Mark E. Recktenwald 
/s/ Paula A. Nakayama

/s/ Todd W. Eddins 
   
     
 
   
   
   
 
 
 
 
  
 
 merit[.]” A meritless claim, without more, is not sufficient to 
show that the claim is frivolous or that the party acted in bad 
faith. See Tagupa , 135 Hawaiʻi at 479, 353 P.3d at 1021. 
Therefore, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in 
finding HRC ’s  ownership claim was not frivolous or made in bad 
faith. As such, the circuit court did not err in  denying 
Petitioners attorneys’ fees under HRS §  607-14.5. The ICA did 
not err in holding  the same.  
V. CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, the ICA’s March 31, 2021 
Judgment on Appeal is vacated. Awarding fees on fees under the 
PAG doctrine is permitted, and furthers the doctrine’s rationale 
of vindicating important public rights. The JPA was not 
dipositive in analyzing Petitioner’s eligibi lity for attorneys ’ 
fees under the PAG doctrine. Petitioners’ second AF motion was 
not precluded as a matter of law , and Petitioners are eligible 
for fees on fees . The case is remanded to the circuit court for 
proceedings consistent with this opinion.
