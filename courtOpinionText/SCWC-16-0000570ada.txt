2 (continued) nuisance.  
We conclude that, as a matter of law, such a claim is 
cognizable when the plaintiff has suffered individualized harm.  
Plaintiff Shadley Haynes (Shadley) was allegedly 
assaulted by Gregory Haas (Haas) in the parking lot of 
Rockstarz, a bar that Shadley and his wife, Kurstin Haynes, 
owned and operated.  Shadley sustained serious injuries.  
Rockstarz -  now closed - was located about 0.3 miles from Allied 
Self Storage Center (Allied) .    
Shadley, Kurstin,  and The Other Side -  Rockstarz  - LLC 
(collectively, “Plaintiffs”), filed suit in the Circuit Court of 
the Third Circuit alleging that Allied and Chung Partners 
(collectively, “Defendants”) had created and maintained a public  
nuisance by permitting Haas and other homeless individuals to 
live on their premises in violation of Hawai‘i County zoning 
codes.  Plaintiffs alleged that the nuisance was a substantial 
factor in causing Plaintiffs’ injuries and that they are 
entitled to damages. 1
The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of 
Defendants.   The Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) affirmed 2
                                                 
1  Kurstin sued Defendants both as an individual and as the parent and  
legal guardian of J H and NH, Kurstin and Shadley’s children.  
    
2  The circuit court also granted Chung Partners’ Motion for C osts under   
 
  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
3 (continued)the circuit court’s summary judgment orders on the grounds that 
Plaintiffs could not recover damages for public nuisance in the 
absence of a statute designating the activity as a public 
nuisance.  On certiorari, Plaintiffs argue that the ICA gravely 
erred in its conclusion that they were foreclosed from 
recovering damages as a matter of law
. 
We hold that a plaintiff can recover damages stemming 
from a public nuisance even absent an explicit statutory 
prohibition of the challenged conduct when the plaintiff has 
suffered individualized harm.  We thus vacate the circuit 
court’s order granting summary judgment to Defendants and the 
ICA’s order affirming the circuit court, and remand for further 
proceedings consistent with this opinion. 
II.  BACKGROUND 
A. Circuit Court Proceedings  3
 1.  Complaint 
Plaintiffs filed their Complaint on May 2, 2012, and 
amended it three times.   Count V of the Third Amended Complaint, 4
                                                 
Hawai‘i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rules 54(d) and 68, which the ICA 
affirmed in part.  As set forth below, because we vacate the circuit court’s 
grant of summary judgment, we also vacate the award of costs.  
 
3  The Honorable Ronald Ibarra presided.  
 
4  Plaintiffs’ Third Amended Complaint also named Defendants Haas, FPA  
 
 
  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
4 the only count that implicated A llied and Chung  Partners, 
alleged: 
59.  By allowing Defendant Haas and others to live in 
one of its storage units in violation of land use and 
public health laws, Defendant Allied caused its 
property and the surrounding non -residential area to 
become a home to vagrants, drug users, criminals and 
other dangerous and undesirable people who otherwise 
would not be in this business and industrial area at 
night.  As a result, Defendant Allied created a 
condition that was (a) unreasonably dangerous and (b) 
affected a public place, and thereby maintained a 
public nuisance. 
 
60.  As lessee/sub- lessor of the 74 -5540 Kaiwi Street 
property (“Allied Storage property”), Defendant Chung 
had a duty not to maintain the hereinabove described 
nuisance on the property. 
 
61.  Defendant Chung breached its duty not to 
maintain the hereinabove described nuisance on the 
Allied Storage property. 
 
The Third Amended Complaint also alleged that as a 
proximate result of this nuisance, Shadley suffered severe 
physical injuries, traumatic brain injury, and severe emotional 
distress; that Shadley, Kurstin, and their children, JH and NH , 
suffered other special and general damages to be proven at 
                                                 
Gold Coast Associates, LLC (Gold Coast), Clark Realty Corporation (Clark), 
Kona Metro Parking & Watchman Services, Inc. (Metro), Guido Giacometti 
(Giacometti), and Doe Defendants 1 -10.  Plaintiffs alleged that Gold Coast 
owned and leased the property where Rockstarz was located, while Clark was a 
property management business.  According to Plaintiffs, Metro was a security 
business for parking lots and other areas around the Rockstarz building, and 
Giacometti was the receiver Clark had hired to manage the Rockstarz premises’ 
daily affairs.   
 
In addition to Count V against Defendants , Plaintiffs’ complaint 
asserted one count of assault and battery against Haas, four counts of 
negligence and gross negligence against Gold Coast, Clark, Metro, and 
Giacometti, respectively, and one count against all of the defendants on 
behalf of J H and NH for loss of consortium, intentional infliction of 
emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress .

5 trial; and that Rockstarz suffered loss of business and 
diminished business reputation. 
2. Chung Partners’ Motions for Summary Judgment  
In two separate motions for summary judgment, Chung 
Partners argued that it was not liable for Plaintiffs’ damages, 
first because it had no duty to Shadley, and second because it 
had no knowledge of homeless individuals residing in storage 
units.  Allied filed a notice of joinder in both motions. 
Chung Partners argued that under Restatement (Second) 
of Torts §§ 837  and 356  (Am. Law Inst. 1979) (Restatement) it 6 5
                                                 
5  Restatement 2d of Torts § 837 provides:  
 
(1) A lessor of land is subject to liability for a 
nuisance caused by an activity carried on upon the 
land while the lease continues and the lessor 
continues as owner, if the lessor would be liable if 
he had carried on the activity himself, and  
 
(a) at the time of the lease the lessor consents to 
the activity or knows or has reason to know that it 
will be carried on, and 
 
(b) he then knows or should know that it will 
necessarily involve or is causing the nuisance.  
 
6  Restatement 2d of Torts § 356 comment (a) provides:  
 
When land is leased to a tenant, the law of property 
regards the lease as equivalent to a sale of land for 
the term of the lease.  The lessee acquires an estate 
in the land, and becomes for the time being the owner 
and occupier, subject to all of the liabilities of 
one in possession, both to those who enter the land 
and to those outside of it . . . .  [I]t is  the 
general rule that the lessor is not liable to the 
lessee, or to others on the land, even though such 
injuries resulted from a dangerous condition existing 
at the time of the transfer.  
  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
6 could only be held liable for nuisance on its leased land
 if it 
possessed the land when the nuisance occurred or (1) would be 
liable if it carried on the alleged nuisance; (2) consented to 
such activity; and (3) knew that such activity would 
“necessarily result in” the nuisance.  
Chung Partners argued that although Hawai ‘i case law 
was silent on applying Restatement § 837, “ample case law” from 
other jurisdictions supported its application.   And, citing Hao 
v. Campbell Estate, 76  77, 869 P.2d 216 (1994) , Chung 
Partners argued that Hawai‘i cases had recognized Restatement 
§ 356’s general rule that “landowner[s were] not liable for 
injuries occurring after a lessee takes possession of the land.”  Hawai‘i7
Chung Partners submitted a declaration of one of its 
principals, Sung Hun Chung, stating that Chung Partners did not 
know that Allied allowed people to reside in storage units, and 
                                                 
7  Chung cited to the following cases for support:  City of Los Angeles v.
Star Sand & Gravel Co., 12 P.2d 69 (Cal. Ct. App. 1932) (holding that owner 
of premises leased for purpose attainable without creating nuisance was held 
not liable for creation of nuisance without owner’s knowledge or notice); 
Silverman v. Unsen, 147 A. 421 (Me. 1929) (holding that lessor of shooting 
gallery was not liable to third person for injury resulting from lessee’s 
negligence); Meloy v City of Santa Monica, 12 P.2d 1072 (Cal. Ct. App. 1932) 
(holding that in order to charge landlord with liability, nuisance must 
necessarily result from tenant’s ordinary use of premises, or from purposes 
for which premises were let); Wasilewski v. McGuire Art Shop, 187 A. 530 
(N.J. 1936) (holding that landlord renting entire store premises to tenant 
who undert ook to make repairs was not liable for pedestrian’s injury when 
caused by tenant’s negligence); Midland Oil Co. v. Thigpen, 4 F.2d 85 (8th 
Cir. 1924) (holding that a tenant, not a landlord, will be “owner” so far as 
negligent injuries to third parties are concerned).    
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
7 furthermore, that Plaintiffs’ complaint failed to even allege 
such information.  Accordingly, Chung Partners concluded that it 
could not be held liable for public nuisance.
 
Chung Part ners next argued that, contrary to 
Plaintiffs’ assertion, it had no “duty not to maintain” a 
nuisance on Allied’s property.  Chung Partners explained that 
under Hawai‘i case law, “courts are reluctant to impose a duty on 
owners and occupiers of land to protect others against the 
criminal act[s] of third parties. ”  And, because Hawai‘ i follows 
Restatement § 315, only a “special relationship” between Chung 
Partners and Plaintiffs could require Chung Partners to protect 
them from harm by Haas.  In the instant case, Chung Partners 
argued, there was no special relationship between it and 
Plaintiffs.  Accordingly, Chung Partners concluded that it could 
not have been required to control Haas’ conduct.  8
                                                 
8  Restatement § 315 provides:  
 
There is no duty so to control the conduct of a third 
person as to prevent him from causing physical harm 
to another unless: 
 
(a) A special relation exists between the actor and 
the third person which imposes a duty upon the actor
to control the third person’s conduct, or   
 
(b) A special relation exists between the actor and 
the other which gives to the other a right to 
protection.  
 
  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
8 In Chung Partners’ second Motion for Summary J udgment, 
it noted that Restatement § 821B construed public nuisances as 
unreasonable conduct of a certain nature.   Second, Chung 
Partners pointed out that in Littleton v. State, 66 Haw. 55, 67, 
656 P.2d 1336, 1344-45 (1982), this court held that for behavior 
to be a public nuisance, the act or use of the property at issue 
must have been in a public place or somewhere the public 
frequently congregated. 9
Chung Partners further maintained that people could 
not be nuisances; only their unreasonable conduct could be a 
nuisance if it interfered with a common right.  And even if 
Allied created a nuisance, it did not create an unreasonable 
interference with any right common to the general public or to 
                                                 
9  Restatement § 821B provides:  
 
(1)  A public nuisance is an unreasonable 
interference with a right common to the general 
public. 
 
(2)  Circumstances that may sustain a holding that
an interference with a public right is unreasonable
include the following:  
 
 
(a)  Whether the conduct involves a 
significant interference with the public health, the 
public safety, the public peace, the public comfort, 
or the public convenience, or 
 
(b)  whether the conduct is proscribed by a 
statute, ordinance, or administrative regulation, or  
 
(c)  whether the conduct is of a continuing 
nature or has produced a permanent or long -lasting 
effect, and, as the actor knows or has reason to 
know, has a significant effect upon the public right.

3.  Plaintiffs’ Response to Chung Partners’ Motions for 
Summary Judgment  
 
  
Citing Littleton v. State, 66 Haw. at 67, 656 P.2d at 
1344-45 (1982), and Territory v. Fujiwara, 33 Haw. 428, 429-30 
(1935), Plaintiffs argued that a court may not decide at summary 
judgment whether a public nuisance exists; instead, that 
question is reserved for the fact-finder.  Plaintiffs also 
argued that, as a matter of law, defendants can be held liable 
for public nuisances that extend from activity on the 
defendants’ property.  
Plaintiffs next noted that the use of the storage 
units for residences was “illegal” because the area was zoned as 
“General Industrial.”  Furthermore, Plaintiffs relied on the 
expert testimony of Spike Denis, a premises security expert, 
that it was reasonably foreseeable that homeless residents would 
commit assault, not only on the premises but in the surrounding  
community.   
Plaintiffs presented evidence that the encampment at 
Allied was long- running and obvious.  For example, Plaintiffs 
quoted from the declaration of James Smith, who stated that he 
resided in a  storage unit, and that Roy Ebert, who worked under 
Sung Hun Chung , told Smith “what I don’t see, I don’t know,” in  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
10 (continued)reference to residential use of the storage unit.  Plaintiffs 
further stated that Allied changed its name to Kaiwi Storage 
after this incident, and hired Metro to address the issue of 
homeless individuals residing in units.  Metro employees working
there after the assault testified that they observed signs of 
residential use on the property.    
Plaintiffs argued Chung Partners was liable for the 
nuisance maintained by Allied because one of Chung Partners’ 
principals, Sung Hun Chung, knew or should have known of the 
homeless situation on Allied’s leased property.  On the date of 
the incident, Plaintiffs alleged, Sung Hun Chung was not only 
the managing partner of Chung Partners, but also the manager and
secretary of Allied.  Further, Sung Hun Chung had an office and 
P.O. box on Allied’s premises for nearly six years.   
Accordingly, Plaintiffs argued Sung Hun Chung knew or should 
have known about Allied’s homeless residents.  10 
                                                 
10  Plaintiffs presented two other alternative theories of liability.  
First, Plaintiffs argued that there were unresolved issues of material fact 
as to whether Chung Partners, as transferee of Allied’s business in 2012, 
assumed Allied’s liabilities.  Though the purchase and sale agreement was 
written as a sale of assets, Plaintiffs raised several factual issues that  
they contended  could have supported Chung Partners’ liability.  
 
Second, Plaintiffs argued that Chung Partners was never out of 
possession of the premises leased to Allied, and therefore Chung Partners was 
tenants-in-common with Allied and equally liable for Allied’s torts.  The 
Allied premises were originally leased by  the Trustees of the Lili ‘uokalani  
 
 
  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
11  The circuit court heard Chung Partners ’ Motions for 
Summary Judgment and Allied’s Notice of Joinder, and 
subsequently granted the three motions in a minute order.  The 
court’s minute order was brief and did not explain its specific 
rationale for granting Defendants’ motions for summary judgmen t. 
Chung Partners then filed a Motion for Costs pursuant 
to HRCP Rules 54(d)  and 68.  In its Memorandum of Support, 12 11
                                                 
Trust to Chung Partners.  Chung Partners thereafter subleased a portion of 
the premises to Allied, but the sublease did not provide specific metes and 
bounds of the premises.  Therefore, Allied and Chung Partners were co- tenants
in equal possession of the premises under Hawai‘i law and Allied maintained 
interest in all of the larger area.  
 
11  HRCP Rule 54(d) provides in relevant part:  
 
(d) Costs; Attorneys’ Fees  
 
(1)  Costs Other Than Attorneys’ Fees . Except 
when express provision therefor is made either in a 
statute or in these rules, costs shall be allowed as 
of course to the prevailing party unless the court 
otherwise directs; but costs against the State or a 
county, or an officer or agency of the State or a 
county, shall be imposed only to the extent permitted 
by law... 
 
(2) Attorneys’ Fees.  
 
(A)  Claims for attorneys’ fees and 
related nontaxable expenses shall 
be made by motion unless the 
substantive law governing the 
action provides for the recovery of 
such fees as an element of damages 
to be proved at trial.  
 
12  HRCP Rule 68 provides:  
 
At any time more than 10 days before the trial 
begins, any party may serve upon any adverse party an   
 
          (continued)  
  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
12 Chung Partners alleged that after a failed attempt to mediate, 
it offered to settle for $25,000 pursuant to HRCP Rule 68 on 
August 6, 2015, with “each party to bear their own fees and 
costs,” which Plaintiffs rejected.  Chung Partners incurred 
costs of $29,429.69 prior to its Offer of Settlement and 
$35,546.76 after the offer was rejected.  After a hearing, the 
court granted Chung Partners’ Motion for Costs in the amount of 
$22,085.22 without stating whether it was granting the motion 
based on HRCP Rule 54(d) or Rule 68. 
                                                 
offer of settlement or an offer to allow judgment to 
be taken against either party for the money or 
property or to the effect specified in the offer, 
with costs then accrued.  If within 10 days after the 
service of the offer the adverse party serves written 
notice that the offer is accepted, either party may  
then file the offer and notice of acceptance together 
with proof of service thereof and thereupon the clerk 
shall, in accordance with the agreement, enter an 
order of dismissal or a judgment. An offer not 
accepted shall be deemed withdrawn and evidence 
thereof is not admissible except in a proceeding to 
determine costs. If the judgment finally obtained by 
the offeree is not more favorable than the offer, the 
offeree must pay the costs incurred after the  making 
of the offer. The fact that an offer is made but not 
accepted does not preclude a subsequent offer. When 
the liability of one party to another has been 
determined by verdict or order or judgment, but the 
amount or extent of the liability remains to  be 
determined by further proceedings, either party may 
make an offer of judgment, which shall have the same 
effect as an offer made before trial if it is served 
within a reasonable time not less than 10 days prior 
to the commencement of hearings to determine the 
amount or extent of liability.  
 
(Emphases added).   
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
13 B. ICA Proceedings  
1. Opening Brief  
Plaintiffs appealed the circuit court’s orders 
granting summary judgment and awarding costs to Chung Partners.  
They argued that under Hawai‘i
 case law, whether a public 
nuisance existed and whether a plaintiff’s injuries were 
proximately caused by a defen dant’s breach of a statutory duty 
were questions for a jury to decide, citing to this court’s 
opinions in Littleton v. State , 66 Haw. 55, 67, 656 P.2d 1336, 
1345 (1982) and Territory v. Fujiwara, 33 Haw. 428, 429- 30 
(Terr. 1935).  Plaintiffs also contended that there remained 
genuine issues of material fact as to the existence of a public 
nuisance on the Allied premises and Chung Partners’ liability 
for it. 
Plaintiffs also argued that the circuit court’s award 
of costs to Chung Partners was improper.  First, Plaintiffs 
argued that because summary judgment was inappropriate, Chung 
Partners was not the prevailing party.  Plaintiffs then argued 
that even if summary judgment were proper, the award of costs 
was still inappropriate because applying HRCP Rule 68 as written 
could deprive P laintiffs of the constitutional right to have a 
jury decide liability.   
Plaintiffs also asserted Chung Partners’ HRCP Rule 68  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
14 offer of settlement was defective because it did not offer to 
pay Plaintiffs’ costs, nor would the offer fully and completely 
resolve all of Plaintiffs’ claims because it did not include an 
admission of liability.  Thus, Plaintiffs concluded the circuit 
court erred in granting Chung Partners’ Motion for Costs.  
2. Answering Briefs  13
  Allied first disputed Plaintiffs’ claim that 
homelessness could be a public nuisance.  Relying on Restatement 
                                                 
13  Haas’ liability for the assault was not contested on appeal.  However,  
Haas filed an Answering Brief to the ICA that asserted the following four  
points of error in the circuit court’s ruling:  
 
(1) Judge Ibarra had a conflict of interest because 
he presided over both the criminal and civil case in 
the same matter.  After the jury convicted Haas in 
the criminal trial, “numerous rulings” were made, 
including summary judgment; 
 
(2) Haas did not assault anyone and was attacked by 
employees of Rockstarz who were drinking alcohol and 
using drugs.  The alleged attack against Haas 
resulted in serious injuries including permanent 
paralysis to half of Haas’ face and four broken 
teeth.  Haas required stitches and facial surgery, 
including metal plates in his eye socket;  
 
(3) there was evidence spoliation of a hard drive 
containing surveillance camera footage.   The footage, 
according to Haas, was hidden from prosecutors and 
police for over a year until a third  party notified 
the prosecutor that the video evidence existed.  Haas 
then alleged that Haynes’ attorney “spoiled” the 
evidence because the footage could not be viewed from 
the hard drive, despite the police purchasing a 
special player for the hard drive; and 
 
(4) that he was “definitely not living at the Kona 
storage facility and in fact never slept there.”  
Further, being homeless did not have anything to do 
with this incident.  
 
Given our disposition of the case, we need not address Haas’ arguments.   
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
15 § 821B(1) and Littleton , 66 Haw. at 67, 656 P.2d at 1344-45, 
Allied defined public nuisance as unreasonable conduct that 
interferes with a public right.  According to Allied, Plaintiffs 
claimed the circumstance of homelessness, as opposed to the 
conduct of homeless people, was the nuisance.  Allied also noted 
that the mere act of being homeless did not interfere with a 
right common to the general public and that Plaintiffs failed to 
provide any evidence of unreasonable interference with some 
public right.  Allied concluded that homelessness was not a 
public nuisance.  
Finally, Allied argued that Plaintiffs failed to point 
to any evidence in their Opening Brief that the assault was 
reasonably foreseeable.  Nor, Allied contended, was there any 
evidence presented that Allied knew or should have known 
homeless people were sleeping in rented units.  Finally, the 
normal and usual operation of a self- storage business did not 
involve liability for an assault by an alleged homeless resident 
“almost half a mile away” from the property.   
The arguments in Chung Partners’ Answering Brief 
mirrored those presented by Allied, and additionally contested 
Plaintiffs’ assertion that it knew o r should have known of the 
homeless individuals residing in storage units.  Chung Partners 
also argued that it did not assume liability for Allied’s torts  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
16 through its purchase of Allied’s assets, which occurred almost a 
year after the incident. 
Further, Chung Partners asserted that the circuit 
court did not err in awarding it costs.  Because the court 
granted summary judgment against Plaintiffs, Chung Partners 
argued that the claim that Plaintiffs were deprived the right to 
have a jury determine its liability was inapplicable because it 
was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. 
3. ICA’s Memorandum Opinion  
The ICA held that the circuit court did not err in 
granting summary judgment.  The ICA noted that in bringing their 
public nuisance claim, Plaintiffs sought monetary damages rather 
than equitable or injunctive relief.  Although no party had  
raised this argument, the ICA determined from a review of the 
case law that this court recognizes that only declaratory and 
injunctive relief – but not monetary damages – can be recovered 
for public nuisance claims not founded on a statutory duty.   
The ICA took the position that in Littleton, liability was 
predicated upon a statutory duty to prevent a public nuisance.   14
                                                 
14  The ICA cited several cases as examples, including Akau v.  Olohana 
Corp., 65 Haw.  383, 652 P.2d 1130 (1982) (holding plaintiffs only had 
standing for public nuisance claims seeking declaratory and injunctive 
relief), and Ideta v. Kuba, 22 Haw. 28 (Haw. Terr. 1914) (holding unlawful 
obstruction of a public road or highway also constitutes a public nuisance 
for which a claim for injunction can be brought).   
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
17 And, in Fujiwara , which Plaintiffs also relied on, the court 
considered whether defendants maintained a public nuisance that 
violated a criminal statute.  Accordingly, the ICA disagreed 
with Plaintiffs’ interpretation of these cases and found that 
summary judgment was appropriate.  
With respect to costs , the ICA determined that 
awarding costs to Chung Partners , the prevailing party, was 
proper under HRCP Rule 54.  Despite this, the ICA concluded that 
Chung Partners’ settlement offer was not a valid Rule 68 offer 
because it excluded “costs then accrued.”  Therefore, the ICA 
held that the circuit court erred in granting Chung Partners ’ 
Motion for Costs under HRCP Rule 68, and it remanded the case to 
the circuit court to determine the appropriate amount of costs 
to award Chung Partners under HRCP Rule 54(d).  
C. Application for Writ of Certiorari 
  On certiorari, Plaintiffs argue that the ICA gravely 
erred in affirming the circuit court’s rulings granting summary 
judgment on the theory that a plaintiff can only recover damages 
for public nuisance where the defendant has violated a statutory 
duty.  As a result, Plaintiffs also contend that the ICA erred 
by affirming the award of costs to Chung Partners under HRCP 
Rule 54(d).

18 III.  STANDARD OF REVIEW 
On appeal, the grant or denial of summary judgment is 
reviewed de novo.  State ex rel. Anzai v. City and Cnty. of 
Honolulu, 99 Hawai ‘i 508, 515, 57 P.3d 533, 440 (2002). 
[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, 
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and 
admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if  
any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any  
material fact and that the moving party is entitled  
to judgment as a matter of law.

P.3d 233, 236 (2004) (citation omitted). 
IV.  DISCUSSION 
The ICA erred in holding that a plaintiff can only 
recover damages for public nuisance where the defendant has 
violated a statutory duty.  Because there are genuine issues of 
material fact as to whether Plaintiffs’ claims were viable, 
summary judgment was improper.  Accordingly, Chung Partners ’ 
Motion for C osts also should have been denied. 
A. The ICA Erred by Concluding That Damages Were Not 
Recoverable for Public Nuisance Actions Absent a  Statutory 
Duty 
 
In Littleton , the court  wrote:  
A nuisance has been variously defined to mean that 
which unlawfully annoys or does damage to another, 
anything that works hurt, inconvenience, or damage, 
anything which annoys or disturbs one in the free 
use, possession, or enjoyment of his [or her] 
property or which renders its ordinary use or 
physical occupation uncomfortable, and anything 
wrongfully done or permitted which injures or annoys 
another in the enjoyment of his [or her] legal  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
19 rights. 
 
. . . 
 
A nuisance, to be a public nuisance, must be in a 
public place, or where the public frequently 
congregate, or where members of the public are likely 
to come within the range of its influence[.]  
 
66 Haw. at 67, 656 P.2d at 1344 (citing 58 Am. Jur. 2d Nuisances  
§ 1 at 555 (1971); City of Burlington v. Stockwell, 47 P. 988, 
989-90 (Kan. App. 1897)). 
In the instant case, the ICA held that equitable 
relief is a plaintiff’s only remedy in public nuisance actions 
in the absence of a statutory duty to refrain from conduct 
creating or maintaining a public nuisance.  On certiorari, 
Plaintiffs challenge this holding, asserting that it improperly 
interprets Littleton , 66 Haw. at 69, 656 P.2d at 1339. We agree 
with Plaintiffs that a different conclusion is warranted. 
In Littleton , the court addressed whether the City and 
County of Honolulu could be liable for damages to a plaintiff 
who had been injured on the beach by a washed-up log when the 
City failed to fulfill its statutory mandate under HRS § 46-12 
to remove debris that could constitute a “public nuisance.”  Id. 
at 66, 656 P.2d at 1344.  After examining HRS § 46-12’s 
legislative history, which characterized O ‘ahu
’s beaches and 
shores as “valuable assets” that needed “regular maintenance[,] 
vital to the tourist industry [and] recreation[,]” we explained:     
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
20 We think . . . that the City has the sole 
responsibility to remove and clear all seaweed, limu, 
and debris “which is likely to create an unsanitary 
condition or to otherwise become a public nuisance” 
from those shores and beaches around Oahu which are 
likely to be used with some frequency by . . . the 
public.  So that if the City fails to perform this 
statutory duty and permits a condition to exist 
which, of itself, creates an unreasonable risk of 
harm, then the City may be held liable for any 
resulting injury. Its liability would be predicated 
upon the breach of a statutory duty which leads to 
harm.   
 
Id. at 66-67, 656 P.2d at 1344 (emphasis added) (citation 
omitted).   
It was from this passage that the ICA derived its rule 
that, absent such a statutory duty, a plaintiff could obtain 
only equitable relief in a public nuisance action. 
A closer look at Littleton, however, as well as other 
cases from our jurisdiction, does not support such a narrow 
rule.  As the ICA observed, this court has generally awarded 
injunctive and declaratory relief, rather than damages, in 
public nuisance actions.  See Akau, 65 Haw. 383, 652 P.2d 1130 
(1982) (holding that plaintiffs had standing to assert a public 
nuisance claim and seek injunctive or declaratory relief); 
Ideta, 22 Haw. 28 (holding that an unlawful obstruction of a 
public road was a public nuisance from which a suit for 
injunction could be brought); Cluney v. Lee Wai, 10 Haw. 319 
(Haw. Rep. 1896) (holding that plaintiffs were entitled to 
injunctive relief from nuisance of loud instruments during the  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
21 nighttime); City and Cnty . of Honolulu v. Cavness , 45 Haw. 232,
233, 364 P.2d, 646, 648 (1961) (holding that abatement by 
demolition of building that constituted a public nuisance was 
appropriate remedy).  
However, none of these cases, including Littleton , 
expressly rejected  a claim for damages in the absence of a 
statutory duty.  To the contrary, several cases from our 
jurisdiction suggest that damages are available even absent the 
breach of a statutory duty.   
In Choy Too v. Kaiwiki Sugar Co., 32 Haw. 611 (1933), 
the Supreme Court of the Territory of Hawai‘i held that in a 
wrongful death action, a complaint alleging both negligence and 
nuisance could proceed as one cause of action for damages.  Id.   
In that case, the wife of the decedent, on behalf of their 
children, sued Kaiwiki Sugar Company and alleged that the 
decedent was ki lled: “(1) [by] the negligent and wrongful act of 
the said defendant and (2) by the said defendant maintaining a 
public nuisance.”  Id. at 612.  The court explained : 
We think the complaint only alleges one cause of 
action which, in separate counts, is presented in two 
different aspects. . . .  Only one right is sought to 
be enforced and that is the right of the plaintiffs 
to recover damages for the wrongful or negligent 
death of their father. . . .  The case presents the 
familiar rule that in actions ex delicto, such as 
this, the plaintiff does not state two or more causes 
of action but only one, when, in different counts, he 
bases his right to recover on different grounds, so 
long as these grounds are not inconsistent with each  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
22 other and relate to the vindication of one primary 
right.   
 
public nuisance action.  Id.   court recognized that a plaintiff could recover damages in a Id. at 625 (Emphasis added).  In other words, the territorial 
Damages for nuisance claims were also permitted in 
Fernandez v. Pe ople’s Ice and Refrigerating Co. , 5 Haw. 532, 533 
(1886), and Whitesell v. Houlton , 2 Haw. App. 365, 366, 632 P.2d 
1077, 1078 (1981).  In Fernandez , the Supreme Court of the 
Kingdom of Hawai‘i awarded damages to the plaintiff when soot and 
smoke from the furnace of an ice factory caused specific harm to 
the plaintiff and his property, finding that necessity of 
providing ice to the public was not a defense to the claim.  5 
Haw. at 535.  And in Whitesell , the ICA determined that a 
defendant whose banyan tree encroached onto a neighboring 
property could be liable for damages from the tree’s falling 
branches.  2 Haw. App. at 365- 66 (although “non -noxious plants 
ordinarily are not nuisances,” in cases where overhanging 
branches or roots cause harm to other proper ty, “the damaged or 
imminently endangered neighbor may require the owner of the tree 
to pay for the damages[.]”).  
Chung Partners argues that Fernandez and Whitesell are 
inapplicable because those cases concerned private, rather than  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
23 public, nuisances.  Chu ng Partners’ argument lacks merit.  
First, the text of the cases does  not limit their applicability 
to either “public” or “private” nuisances.  In fact, neither 
case specifies to which category the nuisance belonged.  And 
this court and others have recognized that nuisances can 
properly be classified as both.  See Fujiwara , 33 Haw. at 429-30 
(“Nuisances are classified into public nuisances and private 
nuisances, or sometimes as both public and private.  The latter 
are sometimes called mixed nuisances, or . . . those which are 
public and which at the same time cause special damages to 
private individuals.”); Prins v. Schreyer, 406 A.2d 439, 442 
(Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1979) (explaining that public nuisances 
could be classified as (1) per se or statutory nuisances; (2) 
nuisances that prejudice public health or comfort; and (3) 
nuisances “which in their nature are not nuisances, but may 
become so by reason of their locality, surroundings, or the 
manner in which they may be maintained”) (citing Burley v. City 
of Annapolis, 34 A.2d 603 (Md. 1943)).  
Thus, our case law does not require a statutory breach 
in order for a plaintiff to assert a claim for damages.  
Littleton provides an example of when a statute would give rise 
to a damages remedy, but does not limit damages to statutory 
violations.  Furthermore, although this court has provided  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
24 injunctive relief in  public nuisance cases, we have not 
explicitly rejected a damages remedy. 
In order to clarify our public nuisance law, 
Plaintiffs ask this court to adopt Restatement § 821C,  which 
allows an individual to sue for damages under a public nuisance 
theory if they have suffered a harm different than that of the 
public.   Under the Restatement, “when the public nuisance 
causes personal injury to the plaintiff or physical harm to his 
land or chattels, the harm is normally different in kind from 
that suffered by other members of the public.”  Restatement 
(Second) of Torts § 821C, cmt. d (Am. Law Inst. 1979).  The 
Restatement rule would therefore allow Plaintiffs in this case 1615
                                                 
15  Restatement § 821C (Who Can Recover for Public Nuisance) provides:  
 
(1) In order to recover damages  in an individual 
action for a public nuisance, one must have suffered 
harm of a kind different from that suffered by other 
members of the public exercising the right common to 
the general public that was the subject of 
interference.  
 
(2)  In order to maintain a proceeding to enjoin to 
abate a public nuisance, one must: (a) have the right
to recover damages, as indicated in Subsection (1), 
or (b) have authority as a public official or public 
agency to represent the state or a political 
subdivision in the matter, or (c) have standing to 
sue as a representative of the general public, as a 
citizen in a citizen’s action or as a member of a 
class in a class action.    
 
16  In Akau, we cited to Restatement § 821C(2) with respect to standing to 
note the “trend in th e law . . . away from focusing on whether the injury is 
shared by the public, to whether the plaintiff was in fact injured.”  See 65 
Haw. at 386 n.3.  However, we did not specifically adopt Restatement §  821C 
through that opinion.       
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
25 to sue for damages since they are alleging a personal injury.    
A number of jurisdictions have adopted a rule 
consistent with Restatement § 821C.  See, e.g., Birke v. Oakwood 
Worldwide, 169 Cal. App. 4th 1540, 1550 (2009); Gilmore v. 
Stanmar, Inc., 633 N.E.2d 985, 993 (Ill. App. 3d 1994); T&L 
Redemption Center Corp. v. Phoenix Beverages, Inc., 561 N.Y.S.2d 
619, 621 (1990) (“It is [] clear [] that one who suffers damage 
or injury, beyond that of the general inconvenience to the 
public at large, may recover for such nuisance in 
damages . . . .  This is old law.”); Johnson v. Bryco Arms , 304 
F. Supp. 2d 383, 391 (E.D.N.Y. 2004).  Such a rule is sensible: 
There are numerous differences between an action for 
tort damages and an action for an injunction or 
abatement, and precedents for the two are by no means 
interchangeable.  I n determining whether to award 
damages, the court’s task is to decide whether it is 
unreasonable to engage in the conduct without paying 
for the harm done.  Although a general activity may 
have great utility, it may still be unreasonable to 
inflict the harm without compensating for it.  In an 
action for injunction, the question is whether the 
activity itself is so unreasonable that it must be 
stopped.  It may be reasonable to continue an 
important activity if payment is made for the harm it 
is causing but unreasonable to continue it without 
paying.  
 
On the other hand, an award of damages is 
retroactive, applying to past conduct, while an 
injunction applies only to the future.  In addition, 
for damages to be awarded, significant harm must have 
been actually incurred while for an injunction harm 
need only be threatened and need not actually have 
been sustained at all.  (See [Restatement] § 821F, 
comment b).  To maintain a damage action for a public 
nuisance, one must have suffered damage different in 
kind from that suffered by the general public; this 
is not necessarily true in a suit for abatement or 
injunction.  (See [Restatement] §  821C).   
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
26  
7 Am. Law of Torts § 20:5, Public Nuisance (2019) (emphases  
added) (citing Restatement § 821B, cmt. i (Am. Law Inst. 1979)).  
Restatement § 821C is consistent with our existing 
case law and logically sound.  We thus adopt the rule as stated 
therein as Hawai‘i law.  The purpose of damages in public 
nuisance actions is to compensate plaintiffs who have suffered 
special harm from past nuisance conduct.  Abatement of a present 
harm constituting a nuisance would not have the same effect of 
compensating a harmed person for their past injuries.  In this 
case, resolving all disputed facts in Plaintiffs’ favor, 
Plaintiffs meet the test set forth in § 821C.  Thus, the ICA 
erred by affirming summary judgment for Defendants. 
Under Hawai ‘i law, “[w]hether the act or thing [alleged 
to create a nuisance] is really so hurtful or prejudicial to 
others as to render it a common nuisance, is a question of fact 
to be determined by the jury, court or magistrate called to pass 
upon the same.”  Fujiwara , 33 Haw. at 430; see also  Littleton , 
66 Haw. at 67.  
In this case, the circuit court’s minute order 
provided no explanation for why it granted Defendants’ motions 
for summary judgment.  Defendants sought summary judgment on 
several bases, including that there was no nuisance and that  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
27 there was no duty owed to Shadley.  However, viewing “the 
evidence and the inferences drawn therefrom in the light most 
favorable” to Plaintiffs as the non -moving party, genuine issues 
of material fact exist with respect to whether Defendants 
created or maintained a nuisance and whether Chung Partners was 
liable to Plaintiffs as lessor of Allied.  We thus vacate the 
circuit court’s judgment in favor of Defendants and the ICA’s 
judgment affirming the circuit court. 
By vacating the grant of summary judgment, we do not 
determine that allowing homeless individuals to reside on 
private property necessarily creates a public nuisance.  The 
jury is best situated to determine whether the facts of this 
particular case, including the commercial nature of the alleged 
transaction between homeless individuals and Defendants and the 
fact that the incident took place in an industrial area.  17
                                                 
17  At oral argument on Defendants’ motions for summary judgment, 
Plaintiffs’ counsel made fact -specific arguments as to the alleged nuisance
present here:   
 
I think if you’re a commercial business and you’re 
operating illegally and providing a base for people 
to be in an area at [] night where they’re not 
supposed to be . . . the question is is it a public 
nuisance? Suppose you had a camp that was very well 
regulated. . . . You had [] a security guard there 
who watched everyone and you were really trying to 
help these people.  I don’t think that would be a 
nuisance because you would have it under some 
control.” 
  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
28  B. Because Chung Partners Was Not the Prevailing Party, It Was
Not Entitled to Costs Under HRCP Rules 54(d) or 68 
  
The circuit court erred in entering judgment in 
Defendants’ favor.  Thus, the order awarding Chung Partners its 
costs pursuant to HRCP Rules 54(d) or 68 was also incorrect.  We
vacate the circuit court’s and ICA’s judgments accordingly.  
Further, we declin e to address Plaintiffs’ argument as to the 
constitutionality of HRCP Rule 68 because the issue is moot.   
V.  CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the circuit 
court’s August 5, 2016 and August 18, 2016 final judgments and 
the ICA’s May 16, 2019 judgment on appeal affirming in part .  We 
further vacate in full the circuit court’s July 2, 2016 amended 
judgment awarding costs to Chung, and remand for proceedings 
consistent with this opinion.
