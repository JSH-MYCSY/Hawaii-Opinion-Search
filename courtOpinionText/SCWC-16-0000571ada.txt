CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS  
(CAAP

RECKTENWALD, C.J., NAKAYAMA, McKENNA, POLLACK, AND WILSON, JJ.  
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J.  
I.  Introduction 
On April 29, 2016, a jury convicted  Petitioner/Defendant-
Appellant Dean Victor Matuu (“Matuu”), who had been indicted on 
charges of Murder in the Second Degree in violation of Hawaiʻi 
Revised Statutes  (“HRS”)  §§ 701.5 and 706-656 (2014), of  the   
 
 
   
     
 
   
 
   
 
 
  
                         ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
lesser included offense of Assault in the First Degree, HRS § 
707-710 (2014), for stabbing his cousin Frank Kapesi (“Frank”) 
on January 25, 2015 at a home Matuu and Frank shared with other 
family members. 
This appeal arises from Matuu’s challenge that his 
conviction was not  
  supported by substantial evidence and that 
the circuit court’s jury instruction s were  prejudicially 
erroneous or misleading.   The ICA affirmed the Circuit  Court of 
the First Circuit  ’s (“circuit c  ourt[’ s]”) Judgment of Conviction 
and Sentence,  concluding in relevant part   that there was  
substantial evidence to support the jury’s verdict and that the 
jury instructions, when viewed as a whole, were not 
prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, or 
misleading.   See  State v. Matuu, No. CAAP-16-571 (App. Sep. 29  , 
2017) (SDO).    1 
For the following reasons, the ICA correctly concluded that 
Matuu’s conviction
 on the lesser included offense of Assault in 
the First Degree was supported by substantial evidence and that 
the circuit court’s jury instruction s, as a whole, were not 
prejudicially erroneous or misleading. However, the basis upon 
which the ICA had concluded “the [circuit] court sufficiently 
instructed the jury re garding unanimity” and that therefore 
“[t]he additional unanimity instruction requested by Matuu was 
2 1    The Honorable Glenn J. Kim presided.   
 
 
  
  
 
  
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
unnecessary,” Matuu, SDO at 10–11, is  erroneous.  The general 
unanimity instruction as to the elements, cited to by the ICA  ,  
did not include the requirement that the prosecution negative  
justification defense  s as an element of the offense .   
Nevertheless, the  circuit court’s justification instructions  and  
the general “unanimous verdict”  instruction  did require  for a 
conviction jury unanimity that the prosecution meet its burden 
of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that it negatived   Matuu’s 
justification defenses.   The justification instruction made 
clear that the prosecution had the burden of disproving the 
self-defense and defense-of-other defenses beyond a reasonable 
doubt, and the general unanimous verdict instruction made clear 
that the verdict had to be unanimous, which would include the 
prosecution’s burden to negative  the defenses beyond a 
reasonable doubt.    
Accordingly, 
although the ICA erred in concluding that the 
elements instruction addressed the unanimity required to 
disprove the justification defenses, the instructions as a whole 
were not insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, or misleading. 
We therefore affirm the ICA’s J udgment on Appeal that affirms 
the circuit court’s Judgment of Conviction and Sentence. The 
requirement of unanimity beyond a reasonable doubt as to the 
negativing defenses element would have been much clearer to the 
jury if the justification defense instructions had specifically

                         ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
included the unanimity requirement.  We therefore provide 
guidance that circuit courts should do so in the future. 
II.  Background 
A. Factual Background 
From 2013 when Matuu was seventeen years old, he shared a 
home with his cousins, Frank2 and Kapesi Kapesi, and two uncles.  
Matuu and Frank shared a living space, which was separated by a 
chest of drawers, television set, other furniture, and a tarp. 
Frank was often “high” on drugs. Additionally, he had been 
belligerent with other family members in the past.  Testimony 
regarding three instances between 2013 and 2014 of Frank’s 
belligerent behavior were provided at trial. 
First, during a family party in 2013 while Kapesi was 
dancing to music, Frank punched Kapesi in the face for “no 
reason,” requiring family members to take Kapesi to a hospital 
for stitches. The incident caused Matuu, who was still in high school at the time, to fear Frank as he “kn[e]w for sure that 
[Frank] [could] do that to anybody and to me, too.”  
Second, in November 2014, Frank directly accosted Matuu 
after Matuu returned from playing basketball, telling Matuu, “I 
going beat you up.”  Nothing came of the incident as Matuu, who 
4 2    Although Frank was referre d to as “Uncle Frank” by Kapesi ,  testimony 
showed that Frank was Matuu’s cousin.  
  
 
 
  
  
  
              
   
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
    
 
 
                         ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
did not know why Frank was mad, told Frank he did not want to  
fight and then returned  to the park.   
Third, in December 2014, after hearing a sudden “crashing 
in front of the garage” as if “something broke ,” Matuu came out 
of his room and saw one of his uncles get up from the sidewalk 
as Frank walked away.  The incident scared Matuu. 
In the afternoon of January 23, 2015, when Matuu returned 
home around three or four o’clock, it was apparent to Matuu that 
Frank was high on drugs. Later, without interacting with Frank, 
Matuu helped an uncle’s girlfriend prepare a meal in a slow 
cooker.  Matuu then returned to his room.  
Around six in the evening after drinking one or two shots 
of Ciroc3 with Kapesi, Matuu went to a friend’s house down the 
road and smoked some marijuana.  Matuu returned home around four 
or five in the morning on January 24, 2015. 
Upon returning home, Matuu went to the kitchen to scoop 
food out of the slow cooker.  According to Matuu, as he was doing so, Frank accosted him: 
[T]hat’s when all of a sudden Mr. Frank Kapesi . . . 
approached me over here, and I seen him with my side --  my 
side vision, and he came to me, and he was like, “Oh,  you 
fucka.  Why you gotta come and eat all the food?   Why you 
gotta eat the food for?”  I was looking at him. “Bro, I’m 
not eating all the food.  There’ s still food in there.  I  
made this food.  I helped somebody make this food.”  But, 
no, he got angry at me.  I don’t even  know what I did to 
him, but he got mad.  After I was  making the food, he was 
still approaching me.  “Fucka, I  telling you why you gotta 
eat all the food?”  
5 3   Ciroc is a brand of vodka.   
 
 
  
 
  
  
 Kapesi, who had heard Matuu and Frank argue about  the food,  
came out of his room when he heard something break.  When Kapesi  
found them wrestling on top of each other near Frank’s bed, he 
“jumped in . . . to break them apart.”  According to Kapesi, 
Frank grabbed Kapesi, slammed him to the ground where he lost 
his breath, and was on top of, but did not punch,  Kapesi.    ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Matuu then retreated to his room, but Frank followed him and kept yelling at him.  According to Matuu,  
he was telling me, “Oh, you don’t hear me, you fucka?”  I 
was telling him, “Bro, I’m not even  -- I’m not even trying 
to argue with you.”  I’m just trying to make my food.  I 
was feeling good, buzzing, and I wanted to have a good time 
because I just came from a friend’s house.  And after that, 
he was still yelling at me.   “Oh, you fucka.  Fuck you.   I 
going beat you up and I’ll put you in the  hospital.”    And 
after that, I was like, “Bro.”  Then I came around.   Came 
around, put my plate on the stool, came around and I stand right here.  And I was telling him --  I was trying to tell 
him nicely, trying to calm him down, trying to kiss ass 
because I know he can hurt me, or he can beat   me up.  I was 
telling him, “Bro, why you gotta –  why you gotta yell at 
me?  Why you gotta --  why you gotta say this kind of stuff 
to me?”  But, no, he didn’t -- he wasn’t even calm down.  
He was already mad at me.  
Matuu was “scared” during the verbal confrontation.  Matuu 
surmised that Frank must have seen that Matuu was fearful and 
began punching Matuu.    At first, Matuu blocked Frank’s punches ;  
ultimately Matuu grabbed and wrestled with Frank.  While they  
wrestled, Matuu   thought that Frank “was gonna beat me up because 
he was telling me he was going to put me in the hospital.”  
Matuu also “was hoping that [Frank] wouldn’t get mad,” but Frank 
nevertheless “was getting mad” while they wrestled.

 An autopsy of Frank’s body showed multiple blunt force 
injuries, four stab wounds of the torso, and two incised wounds, 
i.e., wounds that are longer on the surface of the skin than ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
In the meantime, Matuu was “scared” when Frank had slammed 
Kapesi to the ground.  According to Matuu, Frank was punching 
Kapesi.  Matuu thought that Frank would come after him when 
Frank was “done with” Kapesi , and therefore Matuu needed to 
“protect[] himself .” Thus, when Matuu had “br[oken] free” while 
Frank was on top of Kapesi, he went to the kitchen and grabbed a 
steak knife. 
According to Matuu, when he came back from the kitchen, 
Frank was still on Kapesi, so Matuu stabbed Frank once “on the side” to “stop him ” because he knew Frank was strong and 
violent. After stabbing Frank, Matuu said to Frank: “ I told 
you, bro. I told you to stop, but you was pushing me, and you 
was bothering me, and you was telling me you was going beat me 
up and put me in the hospital.” 
However, according to Kapesi, after he got his wind back, 
he stood between Matuu and Frank and yelled, “Stop already. 
Enough.”  Kapesi saw Matuu return “fast” from the kitchen area.  
Kapesi then put his hand up to stop Matuu from swinging at Frank 
and received a cut on his hand.  Kapesi was in shock, tended to 
his cut for about thirty seconds, and the “next thing [he] knew, 
Frank was on the ground” gasping for air.

they are deep.  A knife blade was found within a wound track 
that perforated the left lung and the pulmonary artery.  Another 
knife blade was found  at the scene near Frank’s body, although  
Matuu testified that he recalled grabbing only one knife.  A toxicology report showed that methamphetamine and amphetamine 
were present in Frank’s blood.   
B. Procedural Background 
Opening statements were made on April 26, 2016, and trial 
continued on April 28 and 29, 2016.  After closing arguments, 
the jury was instructed in relevant part to “consider all of the 
instructions as a whole and consider each instruction in light 
of all of the others” ; to “presume the defendant is innocent of 
the charge against him” as “the prosecution has the duty of 
proving every material element of the offense charged against 
the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt”; and that “[i]n order 
for the prosecution to prove an element, all twelve jurors must 
unanimously agree that the same act has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.” 
The jury was then  instructed on the “material elements”  of 
Murder in the Second Degree and  all of its  included offenses, 
“each of which the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt.”    The circuit court further instructed that “[s]elf -
8  
 
 
  
 
 If you determine that the defendant used “deadly 
force,” then you are to proceed to the section in this 
instruction entitled “Deadly Force Used.”  If you determine 
that the defendant did not use “deadly force,” then you are 
to proceed to the section in this instruction entitled 
“Deadly Force  Not Used.”  You must then follow the law in 
the applicable section to determine the second issue, which 
is whether the force used by the defendant was justified.  
 
                         
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
defense is a defense to the charge of Murder in the Second 
Degree and  all of its included offenses.”   Specifically:  4 
Self- defense involves consideration of two issues.  First, 
you must determine whether the defendant did or did not use 
“deadly force.”  Second, you must determine whether the force used was justified.  The burden is on the prosecution 
to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the force used by 
the defendant was not justified.  If the prosecution does
not meet its burden, then you must find the defendant not 
guilty.  
 
. . . . 
(Emphasis added.)   The circuit court similarly instructed that 
“[d]efense[-]of[-]others is a defense to the charge of Murder in  
the Second Degree and all of its included offenses,”  and gave 
similar instructions regarding the “issues” the jury was to 
 consider.   The circuit court also instructed that “[a] verdict 
must represent the considered judgment of each juror, and in 5
4   Matuu had requested a self -defense instruction.  “[A] defendant is 
entitled to a requested jury instruction on a defense when he presents some 
evidence going to the defense.”  State v. Taylor, 130 Hawaiʻ i 196, 207, 307 
P.3d 1142, 1153 (2013) (citing State v. Stenger, 122 Hawaiʻ i  271, 226 P.3d 441 
(2010)).   
5    Matuu did not propose a defense -of-others instruction.  The circuit 
court, however, correctly gave an instruction on this justification defense.  See Taylor , 130 Hawaiʻ i at 207, 307 P.3d at 1153 (holding that i f  a defendant 
does not request a defense instruction, a circuit court’s  failure to instruct 
on such a defense where there is evidence of the defense upon which a 
reasonable juror could harbor a reaso nable doubt as to the defendant’ s guilt, 
will be reviewed for plain error).   
9  
 
 
  
   
  
  
 
 
 
    
 
 
  
 
 
                         ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
order to reach a verdict, it is necessary that each juror agree 
thereto.  In other words, yo ur verdict must be unanimous.” 
Matuu’s proposed self-defense instruction, which was 
rejected by the circuit court, differed in relevant part from 
the circuit court’s given instruction , as it had proposed to 
clearly instruct the jury that its determination as to whether the defendant used “deadly force” be unanimous b y adding the 
following underlined language: 
If you unanimously determine beyond a reasonable  
doubt that the defendant used “deadly force,” then you are 
to proceed to the section in this instruction entitled 
“Deadly Force Used.”  If you determine that the defendant 
did not use “deadly force,” or are unable to reach 
unanimous agreement on this issue, then you are to proceed to the section in this instruction entitled “Deadly Force Not Used.”  You must then follow the law in the applicable 
section to determine the second issue, which is whether the 
force used by the defendant was justified.  
On April 29, 2016, a jury convicted Matuu of the lesser 
included offense of Assault in the First Degree, a violation of 
HRS § 707-710.6 He was sentenced to five years of incarceration 
as a young adult defendant and ordered to pay restitution and fees.  
C. Appeal to the ICA 
Matuu timely filed a Notice of Appeal to the ICA, and 
presented two points of error: 
10 6   “Assault in the first degree.   (1)   A person commits the offense of 
assault in the first degree if the person intentionally or knowingly causes 
serious bodily injury to another person. . . .”  HRS § 707 -710 (2014).   
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
A. There was no substantial evidence to support Matuu’s 
conviction where the State did not prove beyond a 
reasonable doubt facts negating his justification defenses. 
B. Matuu’s conviction must be vacated where the Circuit 
Court’s instruction on the use of deadly force in self -
protection was prejudicially erroneous and misleading. 
On the first issue, Matuu argued that the evidence at trial 
established that Matuu subjectively believed that his use of 
force was necessary in self-defense and that such belief was 
objectively reasonable.  Matuu pointed to the fact that Frank 
abused drugs often and did so on the night in question, 
exhibited volatile behavior, and in three prior instances, Frank 
behaved belligerently or violently toward either Matuu or 
another family member.  Additionally, because Matuu had seen Frank punch Kapesi in the past, “Matuu reasonably believed that 
Kapesi would have been justified in using deadly force to 
protect himself from Frank’s attack” when Frank had slammed 
Kapesi to the ground, thereby supporting Matuu’s de fense-of-
others justification. 
On the second issue, Matuu asserted that the circuit 
court’s self-defense instruction, which omitted Matuu’s proposed 
language regarding unanimity and the prosecution’s “beyond a 
reasonable doubt” burden of proof, was erroneous because “the 
jury may not have unanimously determined beyond a reasonable 
doubt that Matuu had us ed ‘deadly force’ . . . .  The erroneous 
instructions were not harmless as the jury could have then 
11  
 
 
  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
rejected self-defense because it found that Matuu could have 
used ‘force’ in self -defense, but not ‘deadly force.’”  
The ICA rejected the challenges.    As to the first issue, 
the ICA identified substantial evidence in the record showing 
that even if Matuu subjectively believed that his use of force 
was necessary in self-defense, that belief was not reasonable 
because evidence showed that Frank was stabbed multiple times 
with two knives, and such force was not necessary for self-
defense when Frank was unarmed.  See  Matuu, SDO at 6.  
As to the second issue, the ICA noted that the instruction 
for assault in the first degree necessitated a finding that 
Matuu  had used “deadly force.”  Additionally, as jury 
instructions are to be considered as a whole, see Matuu  , SDO at 
10 (citing Samson v. Nahulu, 136 Hawaiʻi 415, 425, 363 P.3d 263, 
273 (2015)), the ICA concluded the jury instructions included appropriate unanimity instructions.  For example, the ICA 
observed that the jury was explicitly instructed that “in order 
to convict, the jury must unanimously agree to each element of 
the crime beyond a reasonable doubt,” and that “‘[t]he burden is on the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the 
force used by the defendant was not justified.  If the 
prosecution does not meet its burden, then you must find the 
12  
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
                         ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
7 defendant not guilty.’”  Matuu, SDO at 11.   According to the 
ICA, the jury was also given a general unanimity instruction.  
See Matuu , SDO at 10.  Accordingly, the ICA concluded that  
Matuu’s instruction using additional unanimity language was not necessary.  See id.      
Now on appeal to this court, Matuu reasserts the same 
questions he had posed to the ICA: 
1.  Whether the ICA gravely erred in holding that there 
was substantial evidence to support Matuu’s conviction 
where the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt 
facts negating his justification defenses?  
2.  Whether the ICA gravely erred in holding that the 
Circuit Court’s jury instruction on the use of deadly force 
in self- protection 
[and defense- of-others] was 
prejudicially erroneous and misleading?  
For the following reasons, although the ICA erred in 
concluding that the elements instruction addressed the unanimity 
required to disprove the justification defenses, the 
instructions as a whole were not insufficient, erroneous, 
inconsistent, or misleading.  We therefore affirm the ICA’s 
Judgment on Appeal that   affirms the circuit court’s Judgment of 
Conviction and Sentence, and provide the following guidance regarding the inclusion of the unanimity requirement for the 
negativing defenses element.

III. Standards of Review 
A. Jury Instructions 
The standard of review for a trial court’s issuance or 
refusal of a jury instruction is whether, when read and 
considered as a whole, the instructions given are prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, or 
misleading. Erroneous instructions are presumptively 
harmful and are a ground for reversal unless it 
affirmatively appears from the record as a whole that the error was not prejudicial.  In other words, error is not to be viewed in isolation and considered purely in the 
abstract. 
State v. Kassebeer, 118 Hawaiʻ i 493, 504, 193 P.3d 409, 420 
(2008) (internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets 
omitted) (quoting State v. Mainaaupo, 117 Hawai ʻi
 235, 247, 178 
P.3d 1, 13 (2008)).  
B. Sufficiency of the Evidence 
The appellate court reviews the sufficiency of evidence on 
appeal as follows:  
[E]vidence adduced in the trial court must be considered in 
the strongest light for the prosecution when the appellate 
court passes on the legal sufficiency of such evidence to 
support a conviction; the same standard applies whether the 
case was before a judge or jury.  The test on appeal is not 
whether guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether there was substantial evidence to support the 
conclusion of the trier of fact. 
State v. Richie, 88 Hawaiʻi 19, 33, 960 P.2d 1227, 1241 (1998) 
(quoting State v. Quitog, 85 Hawaiʻ i 128, 145, 938 P.2d 559, 576 
(1997)).  “‘Substantial evidence ’  as to every material element 
of the offense charged is credible evidence which is of 
sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of 
14  
 
 
  
 We proceed by examining  Matuu’s second question reg arding 
jury instructions  before proceeding to discuss  the first 
question regarding substantial evidence.  
 
 
 
 
 1. Matuu’s specific concern that the jury may not have 
unanimously agreed that he used “deadly force” lacks 
basis. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
reasonable caution to support a  conclusion.”  Id.  (internal 
quotation marks and citation omitted).   
IV.  Discussion 
A. The ICA Correctly Concluded That the Jury Instructions, When Viewed as a Whole, Were Not Prejudicially Erroneous or 
Misleading, Although It Erred by Concluding the Instruction 
Requiring Unanimity in Finding the Elements Included the 
Justification Defenses 
At trial, in relevant part, the parties agreed to the 
following instruction regarding Assault in the First Degree  
proposed by the court:  
If an d  only if you find the defendant, Dean Victor 
Matuu, not guilty of Manslaughter, or you are unable to 
reach a unanimous verdict as to this offense, then you must 
consider whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty of the included offense of Assault in the First Degree.  
A person commits the offense of Assault in the First 
Degree if he intentionally or knowingly causes serious bodily injury to another person.  
There are two material elements of the offense of 
Assault in the First Degree, each of which the prosecution 
must prove beyond a reasonable doubt.  
These two elements are: 
1. That on or about January 24, 2015, in the City 
and County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, the Defendant 
caused serious bodily injury to Frank Kapesi; and 
2. That the Defendant did so intentionally or 
knowingly. 
15  
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 “Deadly Force” means force which the defendant uses 
with the intent of causing, or which he knows to create a 
substantial risk of causing[] death or serious bodily 
injury.  
 
 “Force” means any bodily impact, restraint, or 
confinement, or the threat thereof.  
 
 “Serious bodily injury” means bodily injury which 
creates a substantial risk of death or which causes serious permanent disfigurement, or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ.  
 
 
   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
“Serious bodily injury” means bodily injury which 
creates a substantial risk of death or which causes 
serious, permanent disfigurement, or protracted loss or 
impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ.  
(Emphasis added.) 
With respect to the justification of self-protection, the 
circuit court’s proposed instruction began:  
Self -defense is a defense to the charge of Murder in 
the Second Degree and all of its included offenses . . . .  Self- defense involves consideration of two issues.  First, 
you must determine whether the defendant did or did not use 
“deadly force.”  Second, you must determine whether the 
force used was justified.  If the prosecution does not meet 
its burden, then you must find the defendant not guilty.  
The first issue is: Did the defendant use “deadly 
force?” 
Matuu then proposed  to add the following underlined language to 
the relevant remaining portion of the court’s proposed 
instruction:  
If you unanimously  determine beyond a reasonable doubt  that 
the defendant used “deadly force,” then you are to proceed 
to the section in this instruction entitled “Deadly Force 
Used.”  If you determine that the defendant did not use 
“deadly force,” or are unable to reach unanimous agreement 
on this issue, then you are to proceed to the section in this instruction entitled “Deadly Force Not Used.”  
The circuit court refused Defendant’s proposed instruction. 
16  
 
 
  This argument  lacks merit.   The ICA correctly noted that 
the jury was first instructed on the elements of first degree  
assault, which were required to be proven by the prosecution 
beyond a reasonable doubt.  See Matuu  , SDO at 9.   Specifically, 
the jury was required   to find beyond a reasonable doubt that (1)   
“Defendant caused serious bodily injury to Frank Kapesi ,”  and 
(2)  “[t]hat the Defendant did so intentionally or knowingly.”   
                         
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Matuu contends  that without the underlined language, e.g.,  
“unanimous[ly]” or “beyond a reasonable doubt,”  when the jury 
proceeded through its instructions regarding self-protection, it 
may not have unanimously determined beyond a reasonable doubt 
that the defendant had used deadly force.   Matuu asserts that as 
a consequence, the jury may have  therefore  inappropriately 
limited the scope of justifiable acts only to those necessary to 
protect against death or seriously bodily injury;  had the jury 
instead been unable to unanimously agree beyond a reasonable 
doubt that deadly force had been used, then the range of 
justifiable acts would include those  necessary to protect 
 against any  “unlawful force.”       98 
8   “The use of deadly force upon or toward another person is justified if 
the defendant reasonably believes that deadly force is immediately necessary 
to protect himself on the present occasion against death or serious bodily 
injury.”  
9   “The use of force upon or toward another person is justified if the 
defendant reasonably believes that force is immediately necessary to protect  
himself on the present occasion against the use of unlawful force by the other person.”

 We next take a c loser examination of the justification 
instructions given the natu re of Matuu’s issue on appeal , 
whether the justification instructions’  lack of an express  
unanimity requirement rendered the jury instructions, when 
viewed as a whole,  prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, 
inconsistent, or misleading, and whether it affirmatively 
appears from the record as a whole that the error was not 
prejudicial.   See  Kassebeer, 118 Hawaiʻi at 504, 193 P.3d at 420.     
   
 
  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
As “deadly force” means “ force which the defendant uses with the 
intent of causing, or which he knows to create a substantial 
risk of causing, death or serious bodily injury,”  the elements 
of first degree assault inherently require a finding that “deadly force” was used by Matuu.  Additionally, the jury was 
further instructed that the finding as to assault in the first 
degree must be unanimous.  Thus, that the jury found Matuu 
guilty of assault in the first degree necessarily means the jury 
unanimously found beyond a reasonable doubt that Matuu had used 
“deadly force.”  Accordingly, Matuu’s specific concern that the 
jury may not have unanimously agreed that he used “deadly force” 
lacks basis.  
2. The ICA erred in relying on the circuit court’s 
general unanimity instruction in its analysis. 
As provided in HRS § 702-205(b) (2014), the negativing of 
certain defenses is an element of an offense: 
18  
 
 
   
 
  
 
          
 
 
 
 
 
   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Elements of an offense. The elements of an offense are 
such (1) conduct, (2) attendant circumstances, and (3) 
results of conduct, as: 
(a) Are specified by the definition of the 
offense, and 
(b) Negative a defense (other than a defense 
based on the statute of limitations, lack of venue, 
or lack of jurisdiction). 
HRS § 702-205.   Thus, the State was required to prove beyond a 
reasonable doubt that Matuu’s self-defense or defense-of-others 
justification was “negative[d].”  Id.; see  HRS § 701-114 (2014) 
(“[N]o person may be convicted of an offense unless the 
following are proved beyond a reasonable doubt . . . [e]ach 
element of the offense . . . .”).   
The circuit court’s general unanimity instruction stated 
that “[i]n order for the prosecution to prove an element, all 
twelve jurors must unanimously agree that the same act has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. ”  In addition, the circuit 
court instructed the jury that “[t]he burden is on the 
prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the force 
used by the defendant was not justified. ” 
However, the  general unanimity instruction required only 
that all jurors unanimously agree that the same act be proven  
beyond a reasonable doubt with respect to an “element”   of an 
offense.   Although negativing Matuu  ’s justification defenses   is, 
as a matter of law,  an element of Assault in the First Degree,  
see HRS § 702-205(b),   the circuit court did not include the 
justifications of  self-defense or defen  se-of-others as an  
19  
 
 
   
 
   
   
   
   
 The ICA did not   observe that the unanimity instruction 
given by the circuit court applied  only to “elements” identified 
by the circuit court, and therefore did not clearly apply to  the 
negativing  of Matuu’s justification defense s.  To the extent the 
ICA’s SDO stated  that the circuit court’s unanimity instruction  
applied to the justification  instructions, we now clarify  the 
ICA decision.    10 
                         
10    Although this court has held that a defendant was not prejudiced when 
the defenses of self and others were not included in the elements 
instructions of the charged crime, see State v. Augustin  , 101 Hawai ʻi  127, 63 
P.3d 1097 (2002), as this court has stated, the right embodied in Hawai ʻi 
Rules of Penal Procedure (“HRPP”) Rule 31(a) requiring that a verdict be unanimous is a substantial one.  See  State v. Arceo, 84 Hawaiʻ i 1, 33, 928 
P.2d 843, 875 (1996).  To the extent the ICA’s SDO suggests that a specific 
unanimity instruction is not needed for justifications such as self -defense 
and defense- of-others warrants further examination, as this court has 
provided only limited circumstances in which a specific unanimity instruction is not required.  See, e.g., State v. Rapoza, 95 Hawaiʻ i, 22 P.3d 968 (2001) 
(concluding that a specific unanimity instruction was not required “if the 
conduct element of an offense is proved by the prosecution to have been a 
series of acts constituting a continuous course of conduct and the offense is  
statutorily defined in such a manner as to not preclude it from being a 
‘continuous offense’”).  
  
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
“element” of Assault in the First Degree. The circuit court 
also did not include in the justifications instructions the 
requirement that jurors must unanimously conclude the 
prosecution had disproven the defenses beyond a reasonable 
doubt. Thus, it may not have been readily apparent to the 
jurors that the general unanimity instruction regarding the 
“elements” of an offense applied to the prosecution’s negati ving 
of Matuu’s self-defense and defense-of-others justifications. 
20  
 
 
  
                         
 
 
 
  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
The circuit court’s  instructional  error, however,  was not 
prejudicial.   In explaining why the jury instructions, when 
viewed as a whole, were not prejudicially insufficient 
erroneous, inconsistent, or misleading, the ICA correctly noted:  
In addition, “[j]ury instructions . . . must be 
considered as a whole.  Moreover, a refusal to give an 
instruction that correctly states the law is not in error if another expressing a substantially similar principle is 
given.”  Here, the court sufficiently instructed the jury 
regarding unanimity.  The court first stated that in order 
to convict, the jury must unanimously agree to each element 
of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. []   Then the court 
gave a general unanimity instruction. []   In addition, in 
the instruction for self -defense, the court instructed the 
jury that “[t]he burden is on the prosecution to prove 
beyond a reasonable doubt that the force used by the 
defendant was not justified.  If the prosecution does not meet its burden, then you must find the defendant not 
guilty.”  The additional unanimity instruction requested by 
Matuu was unnecessary.  1211
Matuu, SDO at 10–11.   As previously discussed, the circuit court 
had instructed: “The burden is on the prosecution to prove 
beyond a reasonable doubt that the force used by the defendant 
was not justified.  If the prosecution does not meet its burden, 
11    It is not entirely clear to which specific instruction the ICA refers.  
The “presumption of innocence/reasonable doubt” instruction does not include 
unanimity language.   
12    Presumably, the “general unanimity instruction” refers to the 
instruction patterned on Instruction No. 8.02 of the Hawaiʻ i Pattern Jury 
Instructions.  The circuit court’s instruction stated:  
The law allows the introduction of evidence for the purpose of showing that there is more than one act upon which proof 
of an element of an off
ense may be based.  In order for the 
prosecution to prove an element, all twelve jurors must 
unanimously agree that the same act has been proved beyond 
a reasonable doubt.  
21  
 
 
   
  
   
                         ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
then you must find the defendant not guilty. ”13 The circuit 
court had also instructed the jury that “[a] verdict must 
represent the considered judgment of each juror, and in order to 
reach a verdict, it is necessary that each juror agree thereto.  
In other words, yo ur verdict must be unanimous.” 
When these instructions are read together, a juror, who  
does not find the State to have met its burden of proving beyond  
a reasonable doubt that Matuu’s use of deadly force was  
not  
justified, “must  find the defendant not guilty.”   Because 
“juries are presumed to . . . follow all of the  trial court’s 
instructions,” State v. Knight, 80 Hawai ʻi 318, 327, 909 P.2d 
1133, 1142 (1996) (quoting Sato v. Tawata
, 79 Hawaiʻ i 14, 21, 897 
P.2d 941, 948 (1995)), each of the jurors must have unanimously 
determined that the State met its burden of proving beyond a 
reasonable doubt that Matuu’s use of deadly force was not 
justified.   As such,  based on the record as a whole,  the circuit 
court’s instructions were not “prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, or misleading.”  See  Kassebeer, 118 
Hawaiʻ i at 504, 1  93 P.3d at 420.  
Thus, although the ICA did not refer to the “unanimous 
verdict” instruction, it correctly concluded that the jury 
22 13    This appears to explain in lay terms to the jury that the prosecution’s 
burden of negativing Matuu’s self -defense justification is indeed an 
“element.”  However, it does not imply that the general unanimity instruction  
applies  to the self- defense instruction, as the ICA appears  to have 
suggested.   
 
 
  
   
  
  
  
 
 
   
 
                         
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
instructions, when viewed as a whole, were not prejudicially 
insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, or misleading.  See  
Matuu, SDO at 11.     
The unanimity requirement as to negativing the defenses 
would have been much clearer to the jury, however, if it was 
specifically included in the instructions regarding the State ’s 
burden to negative the justification defenses.  We therefore 
provide guidance that the circuit courts should follow this 
practice.  
B. Substantial Evidence Supports the Negativing of Matuu’s 
Justifications of Self-defense and Defense-of-others 
Matuu also argues that there was insufficient evidence to 
negative the defenses of self-defense and defense-of-others. 
This argument also lacks merit. 
Once evidence of justification has been adduced,  the 
prosecution has the burden of disproving it beyond a reasonable 
doubt.   See  State v. Culkin
, 97 Hawai ʻi 206, 215, 35 P.3d 233, 
242 (2001) (citing  HRS §§ 702-205(b),  703–301(1) (1993)
; State 
v. Lubong, 77 Hawai ʻi 429, 431, 886 P.2d 766, 768 (App.  1994)).   
The test for assessing a defendant’s self -protection 
justification pursuant to HRS § 703  -304 (2014)14  involves two 
(continued . . .) 
23 14    Use of force in self -protection.   (1) Subject to the  
provisions of this section and of section 703 -308, the use 
of force upon or toward another person is justifiable when 
the actor believes that such force is immediately necessary  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 As the ICA discussed, even assuming Matuu had the requisite 
belief that his use of force was necessary  (prong 1), there was 
substantial evidence in the record to support a finding that a 
reasonably prudent person in the same situation as Matuu would not have believed that the force exercised by Matuu    was  
immediately necessary for self  -protection  (prong 2).  See  Matuu, 
                                                                               
 
 
 
   
 
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
prongs because HRS § 703  -300 (2014) defines “believes” as 
“reasonably believes” :  
The first prong is subjective; it requires a determination of whether the defendant had the requisite belief that 
deadly force was necessary to avert death, serious bodily injury, kidnapping, rape, or forcible sodomy. 
.... If the State does not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that 
the defendant did not have the requisite belief that deadly 
force was necessary, the factfinder must then proceed to 
the second prong of the test. This prong is objective; it 
requires a determination of whether a reasonably prudent 
person in the same situation as the defendant would have believed that deadly force was necessary for self-
protection. 
Culkin, 97 Hawaiʻ i at 215, 35 P.3d at 242 (quoting Lubong, 77 
Hawaiʻ i 
at 433, 886 P.2d at 770).   On appeal, Matuu argues that 
substantial evidence does not exist to support the requisite 
findings under either prong.

SDO at 6.  For example, Matuu testified that he was able to 
“break free” when Kapesi intervened.   Accordingly, a person of  
reasonable caution could conclude  that upon “break[ing] free,” 
it was not reasonable for Matuu to then    go to the kitchen, 
obtain a knife, and return  to stab Frank, who was unarmed.   
Additionally, although Matuu testified he recall  ed grabbing   only  
one knife and stabbing Frank once, the autopsy report   showed  
Frank was stabbed multiple times  and two bloodied knife blades 
were recovered —   one lodged in a wound track in Frank’s chest  
and another on the floor near Frank’s body .   As noted by the 
ICA, a person of reasonable caution could conclude  “that it was 
[not] necessary [for Matuu] to stab Frank in the torso multiple 
times to protect himself against dea th or serious injury.”  
Matuu, SDO at 7.  
A similar two-prong subjective/objective approach is 
necessary to analyze a defense-of-others justification pursuant to HRS § 703-305 (2014).
15 As to prong 1, or the subjective 
inquiry, “[t]he commentary to HRS § 703–305 states that this 
(a)  Under the circumstances as the actor believes 
them to be, the person whom the actor seeks to protect 
would be justified in using such protective force; and 
HRS § 703- 305. 
25  
 
 
  The ICA’s analysis of whether sufficient evidence was 
presented to negative  Matuu’s defense -of-others justification  
focused solely on prong 1(a).  It first states that the jury may  
have simply believed Kapesi’s testimony  over Matuu’s.  Thus,  
with respect to prong 1(a), the jury  could have concluded that 
“although Frank slammed Kapesi to the ground, Frank did not hit 
Kapesi and Kapesi had regained his wind and was on his feet 
trying to keep Frank and Matuu apart when Frank  was stabbed.”    
Matuu, SDO at 7.   Accordingly,  “the jury was well within its 
province to conclude that the evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Kapesi would not have been justified in 
stabbing Frank under these circumstances.”   Matuu, SDO at 7 –8.   
In other words, a person of reasonable caution could have   relied 
on Kapesi’s testimony (and disbelieved Matuu’s testimony) that 
Frank did not punch Kapesi when Kapesi  intervened in the January ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
section ‘permits a person to use force to protect another person 
when [(a)] the actor believes the other person would have been   
justified in using force to protect himself  and [(b)] he   
believes that his intervention is necessary to protect the other 
person.’”  State v. Mark, 123 Hawaiʻ i 205, 220, 231 P.3d 478, 493 
(2010) (emphasis in original) (footnote omitted).  
Prong 2, or 
the objective inquiry, is necessary because,  as noted 
previously, “believes” means “reasonably believes.”  HRS § 703– 
300.

24, 2015 altercation, and therefore conclude that Matuu did not 
have the requisite subjective belief that Kapesi would have been 
justified in stabbing Frank. 
Similarly, with respect to prong 1(b), substantial evidence 
supports the conclusion that Matuu did not actually “believe 
that [his] intervention [wa]s  necessary for the protection” of 
Kapesi.   See  HRS § 703-305(b).   For example, as stated 
previously, a person of reasonable caution could have concluded that Frank did not punch  Kapesi after Kapesi attempted to  
separate Frank and Matuu  , and therefore Matuu did not believe it  
was necessary for him to intervene.    
A person of reasonable caution could also have concluded 
that even if Frank had punched Kapesi on January 24, 2015, Matuu 
was nevertheless un concerned with Kapesi’s well -being.  At 
trial, Matuu testified that because he was “scared” Frank would 
target him after Frank was “done with” Kapesi, he needed to 
“protect[] himself” by grabbing a knife from the kitchen. 
However, Matuu also testified that after stabbing Frank, Matuu 
said to Frank: “I told you, bro. I told you to stop, but you 
was pushing me, and you was bothering me, and you was telling me 
you was going beat me up and put me in the hospital.” Because 
Matuu said nothing about Frank punching Kapesi, and nothing in 
Matuu’s testimony showed he was otherwise concerned with 
Kapesi’s well-being, a person of reasonable caution could have 
27  
 
 
  
 
 
 
  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
concluded that Matuu was not concerned about Kapesi, and 
therefore conclude that Matuu did not believe that he needed to 
use force against Frank to protect Kapesi. 
Yet, even if it were assumed that both parts of prong 1 
were satisfied – that Matuu had the requisite subjective belief 
that (a) Kapesi would have been justified in using force to protect himself agai nst Frank, and (b) Matuu’s intervention was 
necessary to protect Kapesi — there was sufficient evidence to 
support a jury’s finding as to Prong 2, i.e., that Matuu’s belief was not “reasonable.”   
Evidence shows that Kapesi was not afraid of Frank despite  
being punched by him on a previous occasion and requiring 
stitches; Kapesi voluntarily came out of his room to stop Frank 
and Matuu’s fight even though Frank was “high on drugs”; and the 
only injury Kapesi appeared to have suffered from the incident 
was a stab wound to the hand caused by Matuu.  Thus, a person of  
reasonable caution could have concluded that Kapesi would not 
have been justified in stabbing Frank multiple times to protect 
himself against Frank’s punches,  or that Matuu’s intervention 
was necessary to protect Kapesi,  and therefore, any subjective 
belief Matuu may have had was not reasonable.          
V. Conclusion

correctly  concluded that Matuu’s conviction was supported by 
substantial evidence and that the circuit court’s jury 
instructions were  not prejudicially erroneous or misleading.   
However, we provide guidance  that the requirement for unanimity 
should specifically  be included in justification instructions.
