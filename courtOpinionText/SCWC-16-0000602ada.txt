 2 Medical Center (“ QMC”) from 1967—when she graduated from the 
Queen’s School of Nursing —until 2005 when her employment was 
terminated.  In 2002, Porter and other QMC employees in her 
building began suffering from respiratory symptoms  precipitated 
by “environmental health issues” that she believed were the 
result of “contaminated carpet and wall coverings[.]”   As a 
result of the alleged chemical exposure, Porter was treated in 
the emergency room on five separate occasions in 2002 and 2003 .  
Porter was subsequently diagnosed with a disease known as 
Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (“MCS”)2 and filed multiple claim s 
for workers’ compensation (“ WC”) benefits alleging that she 
                     
(continued . . .) 
 
(2009).  This court has explained that a pro se petitioner is not expected to 
comply with the “technical exactness” of the rules because the court will 
make “a determined effort to understand what the pleader is attempting t o set 
forth” and will “construe the pleading in [her] favor .”  Id.  Moreover, this 
proceeding is a workers’ compensation proceeding , and “Hawaii’s  workers’ 
compensation statute is to be accorded beneficent and liberal construction in 
favor of the employee, to fulfill the humanitarian purposes for which it was 
enacted.”  Respicio v. Waialua Sugar Co. , 67 Haw. 16, 18, 675 P.2d 770, 772

641, 647 (1988).  Indeed, all reasonable doubts must be resolved in favor of 
the claimant.  Lawhead v. United Air Lines , 59 Haw. 551, 560, 584 P.2d 119,

2  According to  Porter, MCS is a medical disorder where the patient 
develops sensitivities to multiple chemical compounds, the exposure to which 
can cause cardiac arrhythmias, vascular spasms, and cardiac ischemia among 
other symptoms.  MCS is attributed to long -term exp osure to low 
concentrations of chemicals, including volatile organic compounds.

31, 2002, November 6, 2002, November 8, 2002, and May 13, 2003 .3   
II. DISCUSSION  
The issue before this court arises from the Labor and  
Industrial Relations Appeal Board’s (“LIRAB”)  denial of Porter’s 
request to reopen her claims pursuant to HRS § 386 -89 (2013),4 
and the Intermediate Court of Appeals’  (“ICA”) affirmance of the 
denial.  In particular, Porter claims that the ICA erred by :  
(1) affirming the LIRAB ’s conclusion that she failed to present 
substantial evidence of a mistake in a determination of fact 
that would warrant a reopening of her WC claims  under         
                     
3  The procedural history of this case will not be fully discussed 
as only the reopening of Porter’s claims is at issue before this court . 
 
Porter also continues to raise argu ments related to her allegations of 
fraud, which were waived.  Porter’s claims of fraud are precluded by the law 
of the case doctrine and will not be addressed by this court.   See Hussey v. 
Say, 139 Hawai‘i 181, 185-86, 384 P.3d 1282, 1286-87 (2016) (“[A] 
determination of a question of law made by an appellate court in the course 
of an action becomes the law of the case and may not be disputed by a 
reopening of the question at a later stage of the litigation.” ).   
 
4  HRS § 386-89(c) provides in relevant  part:   
 
 (c) On the application of any party in interest, 
supported by a showing of substantial evidence, on the 
ground of a change in or of a mistake in a determination of 
fact related to the physical condition of the injured 
employee, the director may,  at any time prior to eight 
years after date of the last payment of compensation, 
whether or not a decision awarding compensation has been 
issued, or at any time prior to eight years after the 
rejection of a claim, review a compensation case and issue 
a decision which may award, terminate, continue, reinstate, 
increase, or decrease compensation.

 4 HRS § 386 -89(c); and (2) failing to apply  the presumption of 
compensability under HRS § 386 -85(1) (2011)5 to her case. 
  HRS § 386 -89(c) provides that a request for reopening 
a WC claim must be “supported by a showing of substantial 
evidence, on the ground of a change in or of a mistake in a 
determination of fact related t o the physical condition of the 
injured employee,” and if such a showing is made by the 
claimant, “the director may . . . review a compensation case and 
issue a decision which may award, terminate, continue, 
reinstate, increase, or decrease compensation.”  HRS § 386 -
89(c).  A request for reopening is governed by the procedure 
provided in Hawai‘i Administrative Rules (“HAR”) § 12 -10-63.  HAR 
§ 12-10-63 provides that an application for reopening “shall be 
in writing[ and] shall state specifically the grounds upon which 
the application is based[.]”  HAR § 12 -10-63.  Following an 
                     
5  HRS § 386 -85(1) provides:  
 
§386-85 Presumptions.  In any proceeding for the 
enforcement of a claim for compensation under this chapter it 
shall be presumed, in the absence of substantial evidence to the 
contrary:  
 
(1) That the claim is for a covered work injury;  
 
(2) That sufficient notice of such injury has been given;  
 
(3) That the injury was not caused by the intoxication of the 
injured employee; and  
 
(4) That the injury was not caused by the wilful intention of the 
injured employee to injure oneself or another.  
 
HRS § 386 -85(1). *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 5 application for reopening a case, “the director shall review the 
case file and may, by discretion, hear the interested parties.”  
Id.  Moreover, HAR § 12 -10-30(d) provides that any requ est for 
reopening under HRS § 386 -89(c) “shall be accompanied by medical 
information or any other substantial evidence showing a change 
in or of a mistake in a determination of fact related to the 
physical condition of the injured employee.”  HAR § 12 -10-30(d).  
“Substantial evidence” must be “relevant and credible evidence 
of a quality and quantity sufficient to justify a conclusion by 
a reasonable [person.]”  Van Ness v. State, Dep ’t of Educ. , 131 
Hawai‘i 545, 558, 319 P.3d 464, 477 (2014)  (quoting Flor v. 
Holguin, 94 Hawaiʻi 70, 79, 9 P.3d 382, 391 (2000) ). 
  Here, Porter argues that it was a mistake for the 
Director to deny her claims based on his conclusion that 
“[s]ince  there is no such injury as multiple chemical 
sensitivity, there is no injury per se.”   The LIRAB majority 
determined that Porter failed to produce “substantial evidence” 
of a mistake to support her HRS § 386 -89(c) request for 
reopening.   Porter challenges  the ICA’s affirmance of the LIRAB 
majority’s determination that she failed to produce substantial 
evidence to support her allegations of a mistake of fact related 
to the Director’s determination that she had not suffered a 
compensable illness because MCS is not an “injury per se.”   
Porter also argues that it was a mistake for her claim to have *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 6 been decided on the question of whether MCS is a legitimate 
diagnosis, rather than on the question of whether her injury —
described as MCS or otherwise —was work relat ed.   
  The LIRAB majority’s conclusion that Porter failed to 
present substantial evidence of a mistake in the determination 
of a fact was based on its finding that Porter “offered no new 
credible or reliable evidence that that [ sic] MCS is, was, or 
has become an accepted medical diagnosis or a valid medical 
disorder.”  The LIRAB’s and subsequently the ICA’s 
characterization of the basis for Porter’s allegations of 
mistake was artificially narrow.  The LIRAB’s decision appears 
to assume that Porter was argu ing that the alleged mistake was 
only that MCS became a more recognized diagnosis subsequent to 
the original disposition of her claims.   
  In fact, in addition to arguing the mistake recognized 
by the LIRAB, Porter also clearly argued that it was a mistak e 
for the Director to dispose of her claims based on his 
conclusion that MCS is not an “injury per se” given that  
Disability Compensation Division (“ DCD”) Administrator Gary 
Hamada (“DCD Administrator Hamada”)  stated that the 
compensability of an MCS claim  is dependent on whether or not it 
is work related.   Porter supported this argument with 
substantial evidence, including two letters from DCD 
Administrator Hamada representing  that an MCS injury may be *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 7 compensable if it is determined to be work related.  T hroughout 
the litigation of her WC claims, Porter has repeatedly alleged  
that it was a mistake to deny her claims based on the Director’s 
March 19, 2004 finding that “there is no such injury as multiple 
chemical sensitivity[.]”6  That decision, denying Por ter’s claims 
because MCS is not an injury, was signed by DCD Administrator 
Hamada.  Just over two years later, on September 6, 2006, DCD 
Administrator Hamada represented to Senator Norman Sakamoto that 
an MCS injury would be compensable if it was found to be work 
related.  
  Both of DCD Administrator Hamada’s letters constitute 
substantial evidence supporting Porter’s contention that it was 
a mistake to dispose of her claims on the basis that MCS is not 
a legitimate diagnosis.  The first letter from DCD Admi nistrator 
Hamada was a September 6, 2006 letter to Senator Sakamoto in 
response to an inquiry about the compensability of MCS.  DCD 
Administrator Hamada wrote that the DCD database “is not able to 
                     
6  Porter has been pointing to this mistake all along.  In her July 
30, 2010 letter to the Dire ctor requesting the reopening of her claims , 
Porter argued that her WC claims should be reopened because the Director’s 
March 19, 2004 decision denying her claims was based on a mistaken conclusion 
that MCS is not a valid diagnosis and therefore not compen sable.  Porter 
argued that “[t]here was obviously a mistake in the determination of fact 
previously which precluded Claimant from pursuing her claim, i.e., that MCS 
was not a physical condition which was recognized as an injury.”  In that 
same letter to th e Director, Porter pointed to the September 6, 2006 letter 
from DCD Administrator Hamada and argued that “[a]s per the letter of Gary S. 
Hamada dated September 6, 2006, attached hereto, the Department of Labor now 
recognizes Multiple Chemical Sensitivity ( MCS), as an injury which may be 
compensable.”  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 8 identify cases involving MCS” but that “[a]ny employee may file 
a WC claim for MCS.  If the MCS is determined to be caused by 
work, the injury would be covered under WC , however if MCS is 
determined not to have been caused by work, the claim would be 
denied.”7 
  The second letter from DCD Administrator Hamada was an 
August 10, 2007 letter to Porter in which he again represented 
that MCS may be a compensable claim if it is determined to be 
work related.   The letter stated that “[t]he department has NOT 
changed its policy regarding MCS.  MCS is NOT recognized as a 
compensable injury for all workers’ compensation claims.  
Workers’ compensation determinations are based upon whether a 
claimant suffered a workplace injury/illness , for example, as a 
result of chemical exp osure in the workplace.”   
  Both letters from DCD Administrator Hamada plainly 
represent that MCS is a diagnosis that would be compensable 
under WC if it is found to be work related.  These 
representations stand in stark contrast to the March 19, 2004 
conclusion upon which the  DCD Director relied in denying 
Porter’s 2002 claims:  that “[s]ince there is no such injury as 
multiple chemical sensitivity, there is no injury per se.”  This 
                     
7  The letter continued:  “Automatically covering all MCS claims 
under WC may have the unintended effect of requiring WC to cover MCS cases 
not necessarily caused by work.”  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 9 contrast is underscored  by the fact that DCD Administrator 
Hamada was the signatory of both  contradictory  representations.  
As such, DCD Administrator Hamada’s 2006 and 2007 letters 
represent substantial evidence of a mistake of fact in the 
determination of Porter’s claims.  
  Accordingly, the LIRAB majority’s finding that Porte r 
failed to provide substantial evidence of a mistake is clearly 
erroneous.  Likewise, the ICA’s affirmance of the LIRAB’s 
conclusion on this issue was error.

 10 III.  CONCLUSION  
  For the forgoing reasons, we vacate the ICA’s March 
23, 2020  judgment on appeal and  remand Porter’s request for 
reopening to the LIRAB to determine if Porter’s MCS injury is 
work related.8

8  Though the LIRAB will need to det ermine the work -relatedness of 
Porter’s illness on remand, her symptoms, described by her doctor as an MCS 
injury, must be presumed to be work -connected.  As recently articulated by 
this court in Cadiz v. QSI , “Hawai‘i’s workers’ compensation law begins with 
the explicit statutory presumption that a claimed injury is work -related and 
therefore compensable.”  148 Hawai‘i 96, 108, 468 P.3d 110 , 122 (2020) 
(holding “ [t]o rebut that presumption in favor of compensability, the 
employer bears the heavy burden o f producing substantial evidence disproving 
that the injury is work connected” and “the ‘substantial evidence’ sufficient 
to overcome the presumption in favor of compensability must disprove the 
causal relation of the injury -by-disease to the conditions an d incidents of 
claimant’s employment, and not merely suggest plausible alternative 
explanations.”) .  We explained that “even if the cause of the injury -by-
disease is unknown, that in itself is a salient indication that the employer 
did not produce substant ial evidence to meet its burden of production” to 
overcome the presumption that the claim is compensable.  Id. at 109, 468 P.3d 
at 123.  
  Here, the reports upon which QMC relied, and upon which the LIRAB 
based its decision, provided competing and contradi ctory alternative 
explanations as to the true nature of Porter’s illness including “allergic 
rhinitis from dust or pollen[,]” Porter’s “prior history of [breast] 
cancer[,]” and even “psychological factors.”   As in Cadiz, the reports relied 
upon by the Dire ctor and the LIRAB to postulate that Porter’s illness is 
“medically plausibly explainable by other medical conditions” other than 
chemical exposure at work are insufficient to overcome the presumption of 
work-relatedness.  Id. at 110, 468 P.3d at 124.  Mor eover, “in the context of 
workers’ compensation law, a lack of explanation for experienced symptoms or 
illnesses strengthens  the presumption in favor of compensability instead of 
overcoming it.”  Id. at 112, 468 P.3d at 126.
