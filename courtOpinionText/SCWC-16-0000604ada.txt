OPINION OF THE COURT BY RECKTENWALD, C.J. 
I. INTRODUCTION
In order to commit a crime, a defendant must be 
capable of intending to act wrongfully.  The bedrock principle 
that a crime requires a wrongful intent “is as universal and 
persistent in mature systems of law as belief in freedom of the 
human will and a consequent ability and duty of the normal Electronically Filed

2 1HRS § 704- 400 provides: 
(1)A person is not responsible, under this Code,
for conduct if at the time of the conduct as a result
of physical or mental disease, disorder, or defectthe person lacks substantial capacity either to
appreciate the wrongfulness of the person's conduct
or to conform the person's conduct to the
requirements of law.
(2)As used in this chapter, the terms “physical or
mental disease, disorder, or defect” do not include
an abnormality manifested only by repeated penal or
otherwise anti- social conduct.
2HRS § 704- 408 provides: 
If the report of the examiners filed pursuant 
to section 704- 404, or the report of examiners of the 
defendant's choice under section 704- 409, states that 
the defendant at the time of the conduct alleged was affected by a physical or mental disease, disorder, 
or defect that substantially impaired the defendant's 
capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of the 
defendant's conduct or to conform the defendant's conduct to the requirements of law, the court shall 
submit the defense of physical or mental disease, 
disorder, or defect to the jury or the trier of fact 
at the trial of the charge against the defendant. individual to choose between good and evil.”  Morissette v. 
United States, 342 U.S. 246, 250 (1952).  For this reason, 
if a mental illness or impairment results in a defendant lacking 
substantial capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of 
their conduct or to conform their conduct to the law, then the 
defendant cannot be held criminally responsible.  Hawai‘i 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 704-400 (2019).   
When, after a mental evaluation, an examiner opines that the 
defendant lacked penal responsibility, HRS § 704-408 (2019)  
provides that the court “shall” instruct the jury on the penal-  
responsibility defense.21 
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 We are now asked to interpret and define the safeguards embedded 
in this defense. 
This case arises from a confrontation between Michael 
Glenn (Glenn) and the Complaining Witness (CW), which escalated 
when Glenn allegedly began threatening to strike CW with a 
baseball bat.  Glenn was arrested and charged with one count of 
Terroristic Threatening in the First Degree.   
Early in the proceedings, the Circuit Court of the 
First Circuit (circuit court) ordered evaluations on Glenn’s mental health.  Two of the three examiners concluded that Glenn 
was unfit to proceed and that he lacked penal responsibility.  
However, Glenn told his examiners that he did not believe he was 
mentally ill and that he did not want to assert a defense based 
on lack of penal responsibility.  After further evaluations and 
hearings, the circuit court found Glenn was fit to stand trial, 
despite mixed conclusions by his examiners.  Rather than raise 
lack of penal responsibility as a defense, Glenn asserted a theory of self-defense at trial, but was found guilty.   
Glenn now argues that the circuit court should have 
either sua sponte instructed the jury about the defense of lack 
of penal responsibility, or conducted a colloquy to ensure that 
Glenn knowingly and voluntarily decided not to raise the 
defense.  The Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) affirmed  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
4 
 Glenn’s conviction, holding that HRS § 704-408 must be read in 
pari materia with HRS 704-402 and 701-115 and that consequently, 
“HRS section 704-408 should be interpreted as requiring the 
trial court to instruct the jury or to obtain a waiver on the 
insanity defense only when the jury was presented with evidence 
[supporting the defendant’s lack of penal responsibility].”  We 
agree with the ICA that the trial court was under no duty to sua 
sponte instruct the jury under the circumstances of this case; however, we disagree that courts have no duty to obtain a 
knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of a penal-
responsibility defense.   
Lack of penal responsibility is not merely a statutory 
affirmative defense; it reflects a precept that is fundamental 
to due process under the 
Hawaiʻi Constitution: “A defendant who, 
due to mental illness, lacks sufficient mental capacity to be 
held morally responsible for his actions cannot be found guilty 
of a crime.”  Kahler v. Kansas, 140 S. Ct. 1021, 1039 (2020) 
(Breyer, J., dissenting).  Accordingly, we prospectively hold that once the court receives notice, pursuant to HRS § 704-407.5(1),
3 that a defendant’s penal responsibility is an issue in 
                     
3    HRS § 704- 407.5(1) provides:  
 
Whenever the defendant has filed a notice of 
intention to rely on the defense of physical or 
mental disease, disorder, or defect excluding penal 
responsibility, or there is reason to believe that 
  
          (continued)

 the case, the circuit court must advise a defendant of the 
penal-responsibility defense and obtain a knowing waiver of the 
defense.  Cf. Tachibana v. State, 79 Hawaiʻ i 226, 236, 900 P.2d 
1293, 1303 (1995).  However, because we adopt the colloquy 
requirement prospectively, and insufficient evidence was 
presented at trial to require a jury instruction on whether 
Glenn lacked penal responsibility, we affirm Glenn’s conviction 
and the judgment of the ICA.  
II.  BACKGROUND 
A. Pre-Trial Proceedings4 
 On June 5, 2014, the State charged Glenn with one 
count of Terroristic Threatening in the First Degree, in violation of HRS § 707-716(1)(e) (Supp. 2013).
5  Shortly 
thereafter, Glenn’s defense counsel filed a “Motion for the Appointment of Examiners to Determine Defendant’s Fitness to 
Proceed and Penal Responsibility,” notifying the court that 
                     
the physical or mental disease, disorder, or defect 
of the defendant will or has become an issue in the 
case, the court may order an examination as to the defendant's physical or mental disease, disorder, or 
defect at the time of the conduct alleged. 
 
4 The Honorable Richard K. Perkins presided. 
 
5 “A person commits the offense of terroristic threatening in the 
first degree if the person commits terroristic threatening: . . . [w]ith the use of a dangerous instrument[.]”  HRS § 707- 716(1)(e).  Terroristic 
threatening is defined as “threaten[ing], by word or conduct, to cause bodily 
injury to another person . . . or to commit a felony: (1) With the intent to terrorize, or in reckless disregard of the risk of terrorizing, another 
person[.]”  HRS § 707- 715 (Supp. 2013).  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 “there exists a reasonable basis to question Defendant’s current 
fitness to proceed and penal responsibility during the time in 
question.”  The State did not object to the appointment of 
examiners.  The circuit court granted the motion, appointing a 
panel of three mental health professionals to evaluate Glenn and 
staying the proceedings until the evaluations could be 
completed.   
 
1. The Examiners’ Reports 
In their initial evaluations, two of the three 
examiners found Glenn unfit to proceed and opined that he lacked penal responsibility at the time of the offense.   
Leonard Jacobs, M.D. (Dr. Jacobs), concluded that at 
the time of Glenn’s alleged offense, as well as at the time of 
his evaluation, Glenn suffered from a major mental illness and 
was not receiving treatment.  Because Glenn’s “capacity to 
appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct and [] conform his 
conduct to the requirements of the law was substantially impaired by his mental disorder at the time of his alleged 
actions[,]” Dr. Jacobs concluded that Glenn was not penally 
responsible.    
Like Dr. Jacobs, Tom Cunningham, Ph.D. (Dr. 
Cunningham), concluded that Glenn was unfit to proceed and 
lacked penal responsibility.  Dr. Cunningham opined that Glenn’s  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
7 
 “cognitive and possibly volitional capacity was most likely 
substantially impaired by mental disorder” at the time of the 
alleged offense.  Additionally, Dr. Cunningham concluded that 
although Glenn was able to understand the proceedings against 
him, his ability to “assist in his own defense and consult with 
an attorney rationally was substantially impaired.”   
The third evaluator, Marvin Acklin, Ph.D. (Dr. 
Acklin), concluded that Glenn “appeared” fit to proceed and penally responsible.  Dr. Acklin explained that at the time of 
the evaluation, Glenn “appear[ed] to be cognitively and 
psychiatrically intact” with no psychiatric diagnosis.  And he 
noted that Glenn did not believe he was mentally ill at the time 
of the offense, and that he did “not understand the necessity, 
nor . . . intend to utilize, a mental defense.”  Furthermore, 
Dr. Acklin noted that during his evaluation, Glenn “demonstrated 
a rational understanding of his circumstances, [and noted] that 
he [was] not pursuing a mental health defense because of [its] consequences,” which included the risks of having it on his 
record and future stigma.  Nothing suggested to Dr. Acklin that 
“Mr. Glenn’s cognitive and volitional capacities [at the time of 
the alleged offense] were substantially impaired” by mental 
illness.  Accordingly, Dr. Acklin concluded that Glenn likely 
was penally responsible.

2. October 2014 Fitness Hearing 
At the first fitness hearing in October 2014, Glenn’s 
counsel stipulated to the examiners’ reports but informed the 
court, “[Glenn] did, however, want me to place on the record 
that he does not agree that he is not fit to proceed.  So I 
agreed to do that on his behalf.”  Nevertheless, in light of Dr. 
Jacobs’ and Dr. Cunningham’s findings, the circuit court 
determined that Glenn was not fit to proceed.  The circuit court then committed Glenn “to the custody of the Director of [the 
Department of] Health for detention, care[,] and treatment” and 
placed Glenn at the Hawai‘ i State Hospital (HSH).   
 3. January 2015 Reevaluation Hearing 
After about three months of treatment, HSH requested 
Glenn’s reevaluation.  At the hearing for reevaluation, defense 
counsel again explained that Glenn did not believe he had any 
mental health issues.  However, counsel deferred to the court as 
to whether to order a reevaluation.  The circuit court ordered 
another round of examinations, but only to evaluate Glenn’s 
fitness.    4. Reevaluations of Glenn’s Fitness 
Dr. Jacobs and Dr. Cunningham’s re-evaluations were 
substantially similar to their initial assessments.  And, 
although not specifically requested to do so, Dr. Cunningham  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
9 
 continued to express reservations about Glenn’s penal 
responsibility: “I fear that if Mr. Glenn is found fit[,] he 
will receive a punishment for a serious offense for which he 
lacked cognitive capacity.”   
After the second evaluation, Dr. Acklin changed his 
diagnosis of Glenn from “none” to “indeterminate.”  Dr. Acklin 
also noted that “a diagnosis of malingering is ruled out since 
[Glenn] denies mental health problems.”  Nevertheless, Dr. Acklin concluded that there was “no reason that Mr. Glenn [was] 
not fit to proceed,” although he explained that this conclusion 
was not the same as an opinion based on positive findings.   
 
5. June 2015 Fitness Hearing 
Following the reevaluations, at the June 2015 fitness 
hearing, defense counsel asked the court to find Glenn fit to 
proceed, or in the alternative, to order another round of 
evaluations after a shorter period of treatment.  The circuit 
court determined that Glenn was still unfit, but in light of the defense’s request, decided the court would reassess in three 
months’ time.   
 6. September 2015 Report from the Hawai‘ i State Hospital 
 
Prior to the September fitness hearing, Glenn’s HSH 
treatment team updated the circuit court on Glenn’s mental 
health treatment.  HSH concluded that Glenn “has the capacity to  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
10 
 work with his attorney in his defense, knows his charge, his 
available pleas, the possible penalties if found guilty, the 
roles of various courtroom personnel, and can maintain proper 
court decorum.”  Accordingly, HSH opined, “Mr. Glenn is not in 
need of [hospital-level] care or treatment.”   
At the subsequent fitness hearing, on Glenn’s request, 
the circuit court found him fit to proceed and set a trial date.   
B. Trial6  
The following evidence was adduced at Glenn’s jury 
trial in March 2016.   
On the night of May 27, 2014, CW and his cousin were 
walking towards Foodland at the Windward City Shopping Center in K
āne͑ohe.  As they were walking, CW almost bumped into Glenn.  
CW testified that although he heard Glenn mutter something under his breath, he kept walking.  CW then heard Glenn call him a 
“fat boy.”   
According to CW, when he turned around, Glenn pointed 
at CW with his hand shaped like a gun and told CW that he was going to shoot him.  CW and Glenn both recalled that “the N-
word” was used during the encounter, but each claimed that the 
other had said it.  CW’s cousin testified that although he did 
not remember exactly what was said, CW “wasn’t name calling, but 
                     
6 The Honorable Rom A. Trader presided.  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
11 
 the defendant had been calling him fat boy and all that stuff.”  
According to CW, Glenn told him to take his Bob Marley shirt 
off, and CW did, ready to “scrap.”  Glenn then removed a 
baseball bat from one of his bags, raised it above his shoulder, 
and began approaching CW.  Glenn whacked the bat on the ground a 
few times, hard enough that it may have caused a chip in the 
pavement.   
After witnessing the altercation between Glenn and CW, 
a Foodland manager called the police, but by the time they arrived, Glenn had left the scene.  Glenn was arrested shortly 
thereafter.   
Testifying on his own behalf, Glenn explained that he 
took his bat out to protect himself and to de-escalate the 
situation, not to hurt CW.  He admitted that he called CW a “fat 
boy,” but explained that he only confronted CW because he 
thought he had heard CW call him a dog and “the N-word.”  Glenn 
told the jury that he had come to 
Hawai‘i in 2012, in order to 
“fulfill [his] odyssey and [his] expectations, you know, kind of 
like the great expectations.”  He explained that he was a “master mason,” and that, in order to “fulfill [his] degrees 
within [his] guild, [he had to] go and plant seeds or [] lay 
squares, what we call ‘lay squares.’”  He also explained that on 
the night in question, he was at Starbucks, “doing some work,  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
12 
 networking,” because he was also a “practicing amateur 
physicist . . . working on anatomic nuclei[.]”  Glenn stayed at 
Starbucks until about 10 p.m., when he decided to go to 
McDonald’s to “burn the midnight oil” and “work[] on [his] 
equations and theor[e]ms” in his lab.   
None of the examiners who had evaluated Glenn’s penal 
responsibility testified at trial.   
C. 
Jury Instructions and Verdict 
Per the defense’s request, the circuit court 
instructed the jury to consider whether Glenn had been acting in self-defense.  However, the defense neither proposed an 
instruction for lack of penal responsibility nor objected to its 
omission in the court’s finalized instructions.  The circuit 
court did not discuss the possibility of such an instruction 
with Glenn or instruct the jury about lack of penal 
responsibility sua sponte.   
After deliberations, the jury found Glenn guilty of 
Terroristic Threatening in the First Degree.  The circuit court sentenced him to five years of imprisonment.   
D. ICA Summary Disposition Order 
In his appeal to the ICA, Glenn argued that “(1) the 
[c]ircuit [c]ourt erred in its failure to either secure from him 
a waiver of the insanity defense or to sua sponte require the  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
13 
 jury to consider it, and (2) there was insufficient evidence to 
support his conviction.”   
The ICA affirmed Glenn’s conviction in a summary 
disposition order (SDO).  The ICA first explained that despite 
HRS § 704-408’s language that “the court shall submit the 
defense of physical or mental disease, disorder, or defect to 
the jury or the trier of fact at the trial of the charge against 
the defendant,” the text had to be read in pari materia with HRS §§ 704-402 (lack of penal responsibility is an affirmative 
defense) and 701-115 (instructing that “[n]o defense may be 
considered by the trier of fact unless evidence of the specified 
fact or facts has been presented”).   
Thus, when read in pari materia, the ICA interpreted 
HRS § 704-408 as  
requiring the trial court to instruct the jury or to 
obtain a waiver on the insanity defense only when the 
jury was presented with evidence indicating that the 
defendant was affected by a physical or mental disease, disorder, or defect that substantially 
impaired the defendant’s capacity to appreciate the 
wrongfulness of the defendant’s conduct or to conform 
the defendant’s conduct to the requirements of law. 
 
 Since no evidence supporting a penal-responsibility 
defense was presented to the jury, the ICA concluded that the 
circuit court was not required to obtain a waiver from Glenn or 
to sua sponte instruct the jury to consider whether Glenn lacked 
penal responsibility.  Moreover, the ICA concluded that “[e]ven  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
14 
 if the Circuit Court submitted the insanity defense to the jury, 
there was no context for the jury to consider it.”   
The ICA also found that Glenn’s conviction was 
supported by substantial evidence, and accordingly, affirmed his 
conviction.  Glenn filed a timely application for writ of 
certiorari.  
III.  STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. 
Constitutional Law  
“We answer questions of constitutional law by 
exercising our own independent constitutional judgment based on the facts of the case.  Thus, we review questions of 
constitutional law under the right/wrong standard.”  State v. 
Ui, 142 Hawaiʻ i 287, 292, 418 P.3d 628, 633 (2018) (quoting State 
v. Friedman, 93 Hawaiʻ i 63, 67, 996 P.2d 268, 272 (2000)). 
B. Statutory Interpretation 
The interpretation of a statute is a question of law 
that this court reviews de novo.  State v. Arceo, 84 Hawai‘ i 1, 
10, 928 P.2d 843, 852 (1996).   
[O]ur foremost obligation is to ascertain and give 
effect to the intention of the legislature, which is 
to be obtained primarily from the language contained 
in the statute itself.  And we must read statutory 
language in the context of the entire statute and 
construe it in a manner consistent with its purpose. 
  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
15 
 State v. Ruggiero, 114 
Hawai‘i 227, 231, 160 P.3d 703, 707 (2007) 
(quoting Gray v. Admin. Dir. of the Court, 84 Hawai‘ i 138, 148, 
931 P.2d 580, 590 (1997)). 
C. Jury Instructions 
This court may notice the omission of an unrequested 
jury instruction as plain error if it appears that “the 
defendant has come forward with credible evidence going to the 
defense that the jury should have been able to consider . . . 
and it would serve the ends of justice and prevent the denial of 
fundamental rights to address such an omission.”  State v. 
Taylor, 130 Hawai‘ i 196, 207-08, 307 P.3d 1142, 1153-54 (2013) 
(footnote and internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting State 
v. Kikuta, 125 Hawai‘ i 78, 95, 253 P.3d 639, 656 (2011)).  
IV.  DISCUSSION  
 
A. A Defendant Has a Fundamental Right Under the Hawaiʻ i 
Constitution to Assert Lack of Penal Responsibility as a 
Defense 
 
“The due process guarantee of the Hawai‘ i Constitution 
serves to protect the right of an accused in a criminal case to 
a fundamentally fair trial, and central to the protections of 
due process is the right to be accorded a meaningful opportunity 
to present a complete defense.”  State v. Matsumoto, 145 
Hawaiʻi 
313, 328, 452 P.3d 310, 325 (2019) (quotation marks omitted).  
Inherent in the promise of due process is the fundamental  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
16 
 principle that a defendant who, due to mental illness, lacks the 
capacity to conform their conduct to the law, or understand that 
their conduct was wrongful, cannot be held criminally 
responsible.  See Kahler, 140 S. Ct. at 1038 (Breyer, J. 
dissenting).  As the California Supreme Court recognized, “the suggestion that a defendant whose mental illness results in 
inability to appreciate that his act is wrongful could be 
punished by [] imprisonment raises serious questions of constitutional dimension under both the due process and cruel 
and unusual punishment provisions of the Constitution.”  People 
v. Skinner, 704 P.2d 752, 757 (Cal. 1985) (citing, inter alia, 
Leland v. Oregon, 343 U.S. 790 (1952) and People v. Coleman, 126 
P.2d 349 (Cal. 1942)).  After all, the purposes of punishment are not served by holding a person responsible for conduct they 
did not know was wrong or could not control.  See 21 Am. Jur. 2d 
Criminal Law § 45 (“[A] basic postulate of criminal law is a free agent presented with a choice between right and wrong and choosing freely to do wrong[;] an insane person is not 
punishable because he or she is outside this postulate, and is 
incapable of knowing right from wrong.”).     
 We acknowledge that the United States Supreme Court 
has reached a different conclusion with respect to the due 
process clause in the federal constitution.  Kahler, 140 S. Ct.  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
17 
 at 1025.  However, “[w]e have long recognized . . . that ‘as the 
ultimate judicial tribunal with final, unreviewable authority to 
interpret and enforce the Hawai‘ i Constitution, we are free to 
give broader protection under the 
Hawai‘i Constitution than that 
given by the federal constitution.’”  State v. Viglielmo, 105 
Hawai‘i 197, 210–11, 95 P.3d 952, 965–66 (2004) (quoting State v. 
Arceo, 84 Hawai‘ i at 28, 928 P.2d at 870 (1996)).  Thus, “in 
Hawaii due process protection under our state constitution is 
not necessarily limited to that provided by the fourteenth 
amendment of the United States Constitution.”  State v. 
Bernades, 71 Haw. 485, 487, 795 P.2d 842, 843 (1990).  
 Other states have similarly recognized that under 
their state constitutions, due process prohibits the conviction 
of a defendant who, due to mental illness or infirmity, could 
not understand the wrongfulness of their conduct.  E.g., State 
ex rel. Causey, 363 So.2d 472, 473–74 (La. 1978); Finger v. 
State, 27 P.3d 66, 68 (Nev. 2001); Sinclair v. State, 132 So. 
581, 582 (Miss. 1931) (per curiam).  Indeed, as early as 1910, the Supreme Court of Washington recognized that the defendant 
had a fundamental right under the state constitution to offer evidence that they were “unable to comprehend the nature and 
quality of the act committed”:  
[T]he sanity of the accused at the time of committing 
the act charged against him has always been regarded as much a substantive fact, going to make up his  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
18 
 guilt, as the fact of his physical commission of the 
act.  It seems to us the law could as well exclude 
proof of any other substantive fact going to show his 
guilt or innocence.  If he was insane at the time to 
the extent that he could not comprehend the nature 
and quality of the act - in other words, if he had no 
will to control the physical act of his physical body 
- how can it in truth be said that the act was his 
act?  To take from the accused the opportunity to 
offer evidence tending to prove this fact is in our 
opinion as much a violation of his constitutional right of trial by jury as to take from him the right 
to offer evidence before the jury tending to show 
that he did not physically commit the act or 
physically set in motion a train of events resulting 
in the act.  
State v. Strasburg, 110 P. 1020, 1021, 1024 (Wash. 1910).   
 “In determining which rights are fundamental, we must 
look ‘to the traditions and collective conscience of our people 
to determine whether a principle is so rooted there . . . as to 
be ranked as fundamental.’”  State v. Mallan, 86 Hawaiʻ i 440, 
443, 950 P.2d 178, 181 (1998) (quoting Baehr v. Lewin, 74 Haw. 
530, 556, 852 P.2d 44, 57 (1993)) (alterations omitted).  And in 
this context, “[h]istorical practice overwhelmingly supports the 
conclusion that legal insanity is a fundamental principle.”  
Finger, 27 P.3d at 80.   
 “The idea that the insane should not be punished for 
otherwise criminal acts has been firmly entrenched in the law 
for at least one thousand years.”  Jonas Robitscher & Andrew Ky 
Haynes, In Defense of the Insanity Defense, 31 Emory L.J. 9, 10 
(1982).  In Anglo-American jurisprudence, the legal principle 
that in order to commit a crime, a person must be “capable of  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
19 
 perceiving the wrongful character of his act,” can be traced 
back to scholars in the 13th Century.  Kahler, 140 S. Ct. at 
1040 (Breyer, J. dissenting) (citing 2 Bracton On Laws and 
Customs of England 384 (S. Thorne transl. 1968)).   
 In 1843, these theories culminated in the legal 
definition of insanity by the English House of Lords in 
M’Naghten’s Case, “the most famous statement of the traditional 
insanity defense[.]”  Kahler, 140 S. Ct. at 1038 (Breyer, J., 
dissenting).  The M’Naghten rule set forth a two-prong test that 
focused on a defendant’s cognitive capacity to appreciate the 
wrongfulness of their conduct:  
[T]o establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it 
must be clearly proved that, at the time of the 
committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the 
mind, [1] as not to know the nature and quality of the 
act he was doing; or, [2] if he did know it, that he 
did not know he was doing what was wrong. 
 
M’Naghten’s Case, 8 Eng. Rep. 718, 722 (H. L. 1843).  
 By the time of the founding of the United States, the 
principle of legal insanity was well-established in the common 
law: “Judges regularly instructed juries that the defendant’s 
criminal liability depended on his capacity for moral 
responsibility.”  Kahler, 140 S. Ct. at 1043 (Breyer, J., 
dissenting) (collecting cases demonstrating “the prevailing view of the law around the time of the founding”).  After M’Naghten’s 
Case was decided in the mid-Nineteenth century, American courts  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 widely adopted the rule, with some variations, maintaining it 
throughout the Nineteenth into the Twentieth Century.  Kahler, 
140 S. Ct. at 1045 (Breyer, J. dissenting) (“Variations on the M’Naghten rules soon became the predominant standard in the 
existing states of the United States.”); see, e.g., Commonwealth 
v. Rogers, 48 Mass. 500, 501–02 (1844) (“A man is not to be 
excused from responsibility, if he has capacity and reason sufficient to enable him to distinguish between right and wrong[.]”).  “[T]his long legal tradition. . . reflects the fact 
that a community’s moral code informs its criminal law.”  
Kahler, 140 S. Ct. at 1047 (Breyer, J. dissenting).     
 The legal tradition that penal responsibility should 
track moral culpability also has a long tradition in Hawaiʻ i.  In 
1850, the House of Nobles and Representatives of the Kingdom of 
Hawaiʻi
 adopted a variation of the M’Naghten rule as part of the 
new, written penal code.7  Penal Code of the Hawaiian Islands 
                     
7   The Penal Code of 1850 provided in relevant part: 
 
Any person acting under mental derangement, rendering 
him incompetent to discern the nature and criminality 
of an act done by him, shall not be subject to 
punishment therefore: Provided, however, that if any 
such person, while capable of discerning the nature 
and criminality of any act, entertained the intent to 
do the same, and subsequently does it in pursuance 
and execution of such intent, he shall be held 
responsible therefor, though the same be done in such 
state of mental derangement[.]

 June 21, 1850, ch. IV, § 4.  That provision remained in force 
for over a century. 
 In 1862, King Kamehameha IV signed an act establishing 
insane asylums and, among other things, permitting courts to 
commit to a mental hospital “[a]ny person indicted for any crime 
who shall be acquitted by reason of insanity or mental 
derangement.”  An Act to Establish an Insane Asylum, § 5, 
Appendix to Compiled Laws of the Hawaiian Kingdom 1884 at 507-08.  In the Penal Code of 1869 and through the remaining years 
of the Hawaiian Kingdom, the law on penal responsibility 
remained the same, preventing the conviction of anyone unable to 
“discern the nature and criminality of [their] act[.]”  Penal 
Code of the Hawaiian Kingdom 1869, ch. IV, § 4; see also In re

 The Mary Belle Roberts, 3 Haw. 823, 828 (Haw. Kingdom 1877) 
(recognizing that insanity relieves a person of responsibility 
for a crime).  Following the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom 
in 1893, the Republic of Hawaiʻ i maintained the same rule of 
penal responsibility taken in its entirety from the 1869 penal code of the Kingdom of Hawai
ʻi.  Penal Code of the Hawaiian 
Islands 1897, ch. 4, § 24.    Thus, by the time the United States annexed Hawaiʻ i in 
1898 and established a territorial government in 1900, Hawaiʻ i 
had recognized for fifty years that a person who was incapable 
of understanding “the nature and criminality of an act done” was 
“not [to] be subject to punishment.”  See Penal Code of the 
Hawaiian Islands June 21, 1850, ch. IV, § 4; Penal Code of the 
Hawaiian Islands 1897, ch. 4, § 24.  The law on penal 
responsibility remained the same for the duration of Hawaiʻ i’s 
territorial government and into its first two decades of 
statehood.  See Organic Act of April 30, 1900, ch. 339, 31 Stat. 
141; Revised Laws of Hawai‘ i (RLH) §203-3670 (1915); RLH § 249-4 
(1955).  And the insanity defense seems to have been in regular, 
if not frequent, use during that time.  See, e.g., Territory v. 
Lum Dim, 23 Haw. 792, 794–95 (Haw. Terr. 1917); Territory v. 
Fukunaga, 30 Haw. 697, 735 (Haw. Terr. 1929); Territory v. 
Alcosiba, 36 Haw. 231, 238 (Haw. Terr. 1942); Territory v. ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
23 Adiarte, 37 Haw. 463, 466 (Haw. Terr. 1947); State v. Foster, 44 
Haw. 403, 428–29, 354 P.2d 960, 973 (1960).  
In 1967, the Hawaiʻ i Supreme Court observed that the 
law on penal responsibility “has been in our statute books 
without change since the compilation of the Penal Code of 1850 
by Chief Justice Lee.”  State v. Moeller, 50 Haw. 110, 115, 433 
P.2d 136, 140 (1967).  And we recognized that “[b]oth Section249-4 [codifying the insanity defense] and the M’Naghten rule
hold that a person is criminally responsible for his act if heunderstands the nature of the act and knew that the act was
wrong.”  Id. at 114, 433 P.2d at 140.  Further, we clarified
that the inability to distinguish between right and wrong is, by
itself, a basis for a finding of insanity:
[A]defendant is to be deemed insane and not
criminally responsible if he is found to be suffering
from a mental derangement and (1) he is incompetentto understand the nature of the act committed, or (2)
if he understood the nature of the act but he wasunable to distinguish between right and wrong in
relation to the act.
Id. at 115, 433 P.2d at 140 (holding that the test is not 
whether the defendant understood the nature of the act and could 
distinguish between right and wrong) (emphasis added).  
In 1972, the Hawaiʻ i legislature enacted HRS § 704-400, 
when it adopted a new penal code “modeled in great part after 
the Model Penal Code.”  See State v. Nuetzel, 61 Haw. 531, 537–
38, 606 P.2d 920, 925 (1980).  As we recognized in Nuetzel, the ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
24 legislature intended HRS § 704-400 to modernize the insanity 
defense by providing that (1) “either the volitional or 
cognitive aspects of an individual’s processes may be impaired” 
and (2) “substantial incapacity,” rather than total incapacity, 
was sufficient to establish lack of penal responsibility.  Id. 
at 542, 606 P.2d at 927.  Thus, while the language of the rule changed, the basic principle that a person is not criminally 
responsible if they cannot appreciate the wrongfulness of their conduct remained constant: “A person is not responsible . . . 
[if] as a result of physical or mental disease, disorder, or 
defect the person lacks substantial capacity either to 
appreciate the wrongfulness of the person’s conduct or to 
conform the person’s conduct to the requirements of law.”  HRS 
§ 704-400(1).  As a result, when the Constitutional Convention
of 1978 reconsidered the text and meaning of the due process
clause in Hawai‘ i’s Constitution, it did so after over a century
of consistent recognition, despite four different forms of
government, that the ability to distinguish right from wrong was
essential to criminal responsibility.
In the summer of 1978, delegates gathered to debate 
and consider proposals to amend the state constitution, which had been drafted in 1950, before statehood.  1 Proceedings of 
the Constitutional Convention of Hawaiʻ i of 1978, at vii-viii ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
25 (1980).  Notably, among the various proposed amendments was the 
abolition of the insanity defense, which after its introduction 
by Delegate Tam, was sent to the Committee on the Bill of Rights 
for review.  Id. at 491.  The Committee voted down the proposal.  
Id.  The issue was brought to the floor during the last days of 
the convention, at which point the delegates considered sending 
a request asking the legislature to review the insanity defense 
in order to prevent abuse of the system by individuals who did not, in fact, merit the defense.  Id. at 494.   
It is striking that delegates on both sides of the 
issue agreed that the insanity defense provided crucial 
protection to individuals who did not merit punishment, with 
Delegate DiBianco, who opposed the resolution, noting “[t]here 
are people who have mental disorders such that they are not 
criminally responsible,” and, as Delegate Tam explained, “[t]his 
is not to say consideration shouldn’t be given where it is 
deserved.”  Id. at 493-94.  Thus, even as the convention 
discussed asking the legislature to consider the defense, there 
was no suggestion that persons should be held criminally 
responsible, regardless of their ability to appreciate the 
wrongfulness of their conduct - only that there should be a way 
to minimize abuse of the defense by those who “in no way qualify 
for any type of consideration.”  Id. at 494.  In other words, ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
26 8The delegates ultimately decided not to change the substance of 
the due process clause and recommended only a minor change in order to make 
it gender neutral, changing “No person shall be deprived of life, liberty or 
property without due process of law, 
. . . nor be denied the enjoyment of his 
civil rights” to “No person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property 
without due process of law, . . . nor be denied the enjoyment of the person’s 
civil rights[.]”  1 Proceedings of the Constitutional Convention of Hawai‘ i of 
1978, at 831, 1149 (1980) (emphases added). the concern was “not so much with the defense itself as with 
the administration of it.”  Id. at 496.  Accordingly, at the 
end of the convention, when the delegates submitted their 
proposed amendment to the due process clause of the Hawaiʻi 
Constitution  to the electorate – which subsequently approved it 
- they preserved the ability to raise a penal-responsibility 
defense for defendants who suffered from mental illness to such 
an extent that they should not be held criminally responsible. 
In sum, the lengthy history and tradition of the insanity 
defense shows that lack of penal responsibility is a deeply 
rooted concept, not only in Anglo-American law, but also in 
Hawaiʻi.  This fundamental premise of criminal liability has 
remained consistent from the time of the Hawaiian monarchy 
until today, and it was against this backdrop that the 
electorate adopted the existing due process clause in our state 
constitution.  Consequently, we have no hesitation in 
concluding that due process prevents criminal punishment of 
defendants who, “as a result of physical or mental disease, 
disorder, or defect . . . lack[] substantial capacity either to 
appreciate 8 
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
27 
 the wrongfulness of the person’s conduct or to conform the 
person’s conduct to the requirements of law.”   
 It is against this backdrop, then, that we turn to 
Glenn’s first question presented – whether a trial court must conduct a colloquy with the defendant regarding the penal-
responsibility defense.   
B. 
We Adopt a Prospective Rule that, if a Trial Court Receives 
Notice that Lack of Penal Responsibility May Be a Defense, 
the Court Must Obtain a Knowing and Voluntary Waiver of the Defendant’s Right to Assert the Defense 
 
We have long recognized the vital importance of 
ensuring that defendants know and understand their rights before 
waiving them.  After all, “basic values of personal dignity and 
fairness are enhanced when the defendant is presented with an 
opportunity to choose among relevant alternatives.”  Tachibana, 
79 Hawai‘ i at 235, 900 P.2d at 1302 (quoting United States v. 
Martinez, 883 F.2d 750, 766-67 (9th Cir. 1989) (Reinhardt, J., 
dissenting)).  Moreover, “defendants are often unaware that they 
have certain constitutional rights that may not be waived by 
their counsel or that they must object to waiver by counsel at 
trial.”  State v. Murray, 116 Hawaiʻ i 3, 13, 169 P.3d 955, 965 
(2007) (citing Tachibana, 79 Hawaiʻ i at 234, 900 P.2d at 1301).   
This court has repeatedly found that a colloquy 
between the trial court and defendant is the best way to ensure 
that a defendant’s rights are protected.  Id. at 12, 169 P.3d at  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
28 
 964.  Colloquies “promote[] judicial efficiency by establishing 
on the record that the defendant has voluntarily waived [his 
rights.]”  Id.  For that reason, we require trial courts to 
engage in on-the-record colloquies with criminal defendants to ensure the knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of 
numerous trial rights.  See, e.g., State v. Vaitogi, 59 Haw. 
592, 601, 585 P.2d 1259, 1265 (1978) (guilty plea); State v. 
Ibuos, 75 Hawai‘ i 118, 121, 857 P.2d 576, 578 (1993) (trial by 
jury); Tachibana, 79 Hawai‘ i at 235–36, 900 P.2d at 1300–01 
(right to testify); Murray, 116 Hawai‘ i at 21, 169 P.3d at 973 
(right to have each element proven to a jury beyond a reasonable 
doubt); State v. Hernandez, 143 Hawai‘ i 501, 515, 431 P.3d 1274, 
1288 (2018) (plea of no-contest).  Since the decision to assert 
the defense of lack of penal responsibility raises similarly 
weighty due process considerations, we impose such a requirement 
prospectively here.  
The penal-responsibility defense “stands in stark 
contrast from all [] other affirmative defenses.”  Treece v. 
State, 547 A.2d 1054, 1060 (Md. 1988).  While other defenses may 
negate a defendant’s criminal liability, lack of penal responsibility eliminates a defendant’s moral culpability as 
well.
  Moreover, unlike other affirmative defenses, a defendant 
who prevails on the penal-responsibility defense does not simply ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
29 walk free – the determination of irresponsibility becomes part 
of the defendant’s record, HRS § 704-402(3), and can result in 
the defendant’s commitment to an appropriate institution or 
supervision through conditional release, HRS § 704-411.  Given 
the significant consequences that can result, from a practical 
standpoint, a determination of lack of penal responsibility is 
more akin to a guilty plea than an affirmative defense.  Treece, 
547 A.2d at 1060; see also 21 Am. Jur. 2d Criminal Law § 55 
(2019) (“[W]hile insanity is an affirmative defense in many 
states, the decision to raise the defense is akin to a plea 
decision, and as such, the decision rests with the defendant 
alone.”).  Thus, the nature of the penal-responsibility defense 
and its resemblance to a guilty plea makes a colloquy necessary 
to preserve the fundamental fairness of a trial.    
We are not alone in adopting this colloquy 
requirement.  Numerous other jurisdictions have imposed colloquy 
requirements when doubt arises as to a defendant’s penal 
responsibility: 9
[W]henever the evidence suggests a substantial
question of the defendant’ s sanity at the time of the
crime, the trial judge must conduct an inquiry
designed to [ensure] that the defendant has been
fully informed of the alternatives available,
comprehends the consequences of failing to assert the
9Because the penal -responsibility defense is different from other 
statutory defenses that are not required as a matter of due process, our 
holding should not be read as requiring a colloquy for every plausible 
affirmative defense.

 defense, and freely chooses to raise or waive the 
defense.

985, 991 (Or. Ct. App. 1984) (holding that trial court did not 
need to inquire whether a defendant, who was both competent and 
represented by counsel, had voluntarily and intelligently chosen 
to forgo a defense based on lack of penal responsibility); State 
v. Francis, 701 N.W.2d 632, 640, 640 n.5 (Wis. Ct. App. 2005) 
(holding that defendant’s counsel could withdraw a plea based on 
lack of penal responsibility without requiring the court to 
personally address defendant, but nevertheless advising that to 
do so was best practice).    
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
31 
 In Frendak, the first case to impose a colloquy 
requirement on this issue, the District of Columbia Court of 
Appeals explained that when a defendant chooses not to raise an 
insanity defense, the defendant “relinquishes important 
safeguards intended to protect persons who are not legally 
responsible for their acts from punishment and culpability in 
the eyes of society.”  Frendak, 408 A.2d at 378.  While “there 
are persuasive reasons why defendants convicted of an offense 
may choose to accept the jury’s verdict rather than raise a 
potentially successful insanity defense,” in order to ensure 
that the defendant relinquishes those safeguards knowingly, 
intelligently, and voluntarily, the court held that “a trial 
judge must seek the same type of assurance when a defendant 
chooses to reject an insanity defense” as when a defendant 
pleads guilty or chooses to waive the right to counsel.  Id. at 
376, 378.   
Since Frendak, which has been widely followed, many 
states have drawn similar comparisons between the waiver of an 
insanity defense and waiver of other rights.  See, e.g., Treece, 
547 A.2d at 1063 (“The decision to forego a not criminally responsible plea requires the same ability to choose between 
various alternatives as does the decision to plead guilty, to 
elect to proceed without counsel, or to waive a jury trial.”);  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
32 
 Jones, 664 P.2d at 1221 (“As with waiver of all rights, waiver 
of an NGI plea must satisfy certain conditions in order to be 
constitutionally valid.”); Brown, 890 A.2d at 90 (explaining 
that waiver of the right to present an insanity defense “was de facto a waiver of the essential right in a criminal trial to 
present a defense”).   
Thus, we join these other states in adopting the 
reasoning of Frendak and hold prospectively that a trial court 
has a duty to advise a defendant about the penal-responsibility 
defense and to ensure that a defendant knowingly, intelligently 
and voluntarily chooses to waive the defense.   
The trial court has the “ultimate obligation to 
promote justice in criminal cases.”  State v. Haanio, 94 Hawai‘ i 
405, 414, 16 P.3d 246, 255 (2001), overruled on other grounds by 
State v. Flores, 131 Hawai‘ i 43, 314 P.3d 120 (2013).  While a 
defendant may have sound reasons for choosing not to assert such a defense, a court does not “promote justice” by convicting a 
defendant of an offense for which he or she lacked penal 
responsibility, if the decision to forgo that defense was “based 
on ignorance or incomprehension.”  Treece, 547 A.2d at 1063.  
We now turn to the practical considerations for a 
penal-responsibility colloquy.  First, a colloquy is required if 
defense counsel files a notice that the defendant “inten[ds] to  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
33 
 rely on the defense of physical or mental disease, disorder, or 
defect excluding penal responsibility, or [if] there is reason 
to believe that the physical or mental disease, disorder, or 
defect of the defendant will or has become an issue in the 
case[.]”  HRS § 704-407.5(1); see also Phenis v. United States, 
909 A.2d 138, 155 (D.C. 2006) (holding a colloquy is required when there is “a substantial question of the defendant’s sanity 
at the time of the crime” (quoting Briggs v. United States, 525 
A.2d 583, 592 (D.C. 1987)).    
Second, the colloquy should take place no later than 
the court’s pre-trial Tachibana advisement.10  See State v. 
Lewis, 94 Hawaiʻ i 292, 297, 12 P.3d 1233, 1238 (2000).  This will 
give the defendant an opportunity to consider their options 
prior to the commencement of trial, without overly interfering 
in the relationship between the defendant and defense counsel.11   
                     
10   If a defendant decides to plead guilty after defense counsel 
triggered the colloquy requirement by filing a notice under HRS § 704-
407.5(1), a discussion about the penal- responsibility defense may also be 
necessary as part of the plea colloquy in order to ensure the defendant’s 
guilty plea was made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. 
11   The trial court is free to advise a defendant about the penal-
responsibility defense as soon as practicable to afford a defendant time to 
discuss their options with counsel and, if they so choose, to prepare the 
defense before trial.  Cf. Lewis, 94 Hawai‘ i at 297, 12 P.3d at 1238.  For 
example, in this case, the circuit court could have given an advisement at 
the September 2015 hearing, when the court found Glenn fit to proceed and set 
a trial date.   
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
34 
 Third, with respect to the content of the advisement, 
we adopt the approach recently taken by the New Jersey Supreme 
Court: 
The court should explain to the defendant the nature 
and purpose of the defense. It should generally describe the evidence relevant to that defense, 
including expert opinion that could be used to 
support or counter that defense. The court should 
inform the defendant of his or her sentencing 
exposure in the event of a conviction. It should describe [] commitment and the other potential 
dispositions that are prescribed by [HRS § 704- 411] 
in the event of an acquittal by reason of insanity.  
The court should confirm the defendant’s 
understanding of the insanity defense as it may 
affect the outcome of the trial, defendant’s risk of 
incarceration and the prospect of civil commitment. 
 
Gorthy, 145 A.3d at 157. 
At the conclusion of the advisement, the trial court 
should make a finding on the record whether the defendant’s 
decision to not rely on the penal responsibility defense was 
knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.  
We emphasize that, as with a Tachibana colloquy, the 
court’s only inquiry should be whether the defendant’s decision to waive lack of penal responsibility as a defense is knowing, 
intelligent and voluntary – not whether it is wise.  Valid 
reasons certainly exist for choosing to reject a viable penal-
responsibility defense, not the least of which is the prospect 
of commitment to an institution.  See Frendak, 408 A.2d at 376–
77.  Therefore, the trial court must respect the decision of a competent defendant who is represented by counsel.  Treece, 547

 A.2d at 1062 (“The decision is one for the defendant to make, 
after proper consultation with counsel, just as a competent 
defendant must, ultimately, decide the wisdom of self-
representation or of a plea of guilty.”); United States v. 
Marble, 940 F.2d 1543, 1547 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (“[A] district 
court must allow a competent defendant to accept responsibility 
for a crime committed when he may have been suffering from a 
mental disease.”).  Thus, the colloquy given should be in terms of the defendant’s rights and available alternatives, and the 
potential ramifications of the defendant’s decision.  See 
Gorthy, 145 A.3d at 157.   
Finally, in adopting this colloquy requirement we 
exercise this court’s supervisory powers “to adopt [a] new procedural requirement[] to prevent error in the trial courts.”  
State v. Cabagbag, 127 Hawai‘ i 302, 315, 277 P.3d 1027, 1040 
(2012).  Therefore, this rule applies prospectively to cases in 
which trial commences after the date of this decision.  See 
Tachibana, 79 Hawaiʻ i at 238, 900 P.2d at 1305.  “[I]n all other 
cases, post-conviction evidentiary hearings will be required to 
resolve claims” that a defendant did not knowingly and 
voluntarily waive lack of penal responsibility as a defense.

 Here, as the trial court followed the rules in place 
at the time of Glenn’s trial, and as there is nothing in the 
current record on appeal indicating that Glenn sought or wanted 
to raise a penal-responsibility defense, we do not find that his 
due process rights were infringed.   C. 
A Circuit Court Does Not Have a Duty to Sua Sponte Instruct 
the Jury About Lack of Penal Responsibility When There is Insufficient Evidence Presented at Trial to Support the 
Defense  
  Glenn also argues that the circuit court erred by 
failing to sua sponte instruct the jury on the defense of lack 
of penal responsibility.
12  He asserts that HRS § 704-408 
requires a circuit court to so instruct the jury whenever an examiner concludes that a defendant lacked penal responsibility.  
We disagree.  We hold that the court did not have a duty to sua sponte instruct the jury about lack of penal responsibility 
because notwithstanding the examiners’ reports, there was 
insufficient evidence presented at trial from which a jury could 
conclude that Glenn lacked penal responsibility.  
HRS § 704-408 provides:  
If the report of the examiners filed pursuant to 
[HRS] section 704- 404, or the report of examiners of 
the defendant’s choice under [HRS] section 704- 409, 
states that the defendant at the time of the conduct 
                     
12   We recognize that this issue is unlikely to be implicated in the 
future, since a trial court must respect the decision of a competent 
defendant made after a colloquy.  However, because we adopt the colloquy 
requirement prospectively, this issue may impact cases, like Glenn’s, in 
which the trial court did not conduct a colloquy.  Accordingly, we choose to 
address it.

 alleged was affected by a physical or mental disease, 
disorder, or defect that substantially impaired the 
defendant’s capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness 
of the defendant’s conduct or to conform the 
defendant’s conduct to the requirements of law, the 
court shall submit the defense of physical or mental 
disease, disorder, or defect to the jury or the trier 
of fact at the trial of the charge against the 
defendant.  
 
(Emphasis added).   
Glenn argues that the word “shall” in HRS § 704-408 
means that “a pretrial determination of penal irresponsibility 
automatically triggers a mandatory trial action by the court to 
submit the defense.”  Because two of the three examiners who 
evaluated him concluded that he lacked penal responsibility at 
the time of the offense, he asserts that the circuit court was 
obligated to instruct the jury about the defense.  However, the ICA correctly concluded that the circuit court did not have such 
a duty because HRS § 704-408 must be read alongside HRS § 704-
402 (2019)
13 and HRS § 701-115 (2019).14  
                     
13 HRS § 704- 402 provides in relevant part: “Physical or mental 
disease, disorder, or defect excluding responsibility is an affirmative 
defense.” 
14 HRS § 701- 115 provides in relevant part:   
 
(2) No defense may be considered by the trier of 
fact unless evidence of the specified fact or facts has been presented.  If such evidence is presented, 
then: 
  . . . . 
(b) If the defense is an affirmative defense, 
the defendant is entitled to an acquittal if the trier of fact finds that the evidence, when considered in light of any contrary prosecution 
evidence, proves by a preponderance of the evidence 
the specified fact or facts which negative penal 
liability.

 “It is a canon of construction that statutes that are 
in pari materia may be construed together, so that 
inconsistencies in one statute may be resolved by looking at 
another statute on the same subject.”  State v. 
Kamana‘o, 118 
Hawai‘i 210, 218, 188 P.3d 724, 732 (2008).  HRS § 1-16 codifies 
this rule, providing “[l]aws in pari materia, or upon the same 
subject matter, shall be construed with reference to each other. What is clear in one statute may be called in aid to explain 
what is doubtful in another.”  Thus, HRS § 704-408 must be 
interpreted in the context of Section 704 and the Hawai‘ i Penal 
Code as a whole.  
As the ICA recognized, HRS § 704-402 establishes that 
lack of penal responsibility is an affirmative defense.  And HRS 
§ 701-115, which governs defenses generally, establishes that 
“[n]o defense may be considered by the trier of fact unless 
evidence of the specified fact or facts has been presented.”  
Indeed, “[t]he defendant claiming lack of penal responsibility 
‘has the burden of going forward with the evidence to prove facts constituting the defense and of proving such facts by a 
preponderance of the evidence.’”  State v. Uyesugi, 100 Hawai‘ i 
442, 456, 60 P.3d 843, 857 (2002) (quoting State v. Fukusaku, 85 
Hawai‘i 462, 481, 946 P.2d 32, 51 (1997)).  Accordingly, there 
must be evidence supporting the penal-responsibility defense

 presented during trial before a court is required to instruct 
the jury.   
Additionally, the legislative history of HRS § 704-408 
demonstrates that the legislature never intended to impose a 
duty on the court to sua sponte instruct the jury about lack of 
penal responsibility.  In 1980, the legislature amended HRS 
§ 704-408, enacting the language at issue: “[T]he court shall 
submit the defense of physical or mental disease, disorder, or 
defect to the jury or the trier of fact at the trial of the 
charge against the defendant.” (Emphasis added).  In doing so, 
the legislature’s purpose was “to require that an insanity 
defense be submitted to a jury and disallow post-commitment or 
post-conditional release motions based upon factual grounds.”15  
Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 72-80, in 1980 House Journal, at 1121.   
Prior to the amendment, the “insanity defense [could] 
be heard by, and ruled on in the first instance, by the court at a pre-trial hearing.”  Stand. Comm. Rep. 810-80, 1980 House Journal at 1655.  Under that procedure, a court could grant a 
judgment of acquittal for lack of penal responsibility before 
the case was even presented to a jury.  Id.  The legislature 
decided to eliminate this possibility.  As the conference 
                     
15   In fact, this was likely the legislature’s response to the 
concerns about the insanity defense expressed at the Constitutional 
Convention of 1978.  Cf. S. Comm. Rep. No. 689- 80, in 1980 Senate Journal, at 
1335.

 committee report explained, “the validity of an insanity claim 
should be subject to community scrutiny that a jury, or even a 
judge as a fact-finder at trial, provides.”  Conf. Comm. Rep. 
No. 72-80, in 1980 House Journal, at 1121.  Thus, “shall” in HRS 
§ 704-408 does not mean that the court must instruct the jury on 
lack of penal responsibility even if the defendant never raises 
the defense at trial, but that the court must submit the 
instruction to the jury and cannot dismiss a charge pre-trial 
for lack of penal responsibility.  
Reading HRS § 704-408 in conjunction with HRS § 704-
402 and HRS § 701-115, and in light of its legislative history, 
we conclude that HRS § 704-408 does not impose a duty on the 
trial court to instruct the jury on lack of penal responsibility 
when there is insufficient evidence at trial to support giving 
the instruction.   
Moreover, as discussed above, significant consequences 
result if a defendant is found to lack penal responsibility, including indeterminate commitment to “an appropriate 
institution for custody, care, and treatment.”  HRS § 704-
411(1)(a).  For that reason, asserting the penal-responsibility 
defense is a decision that only the defendant can make.  
Accordingly, it is questionable whether it would ever be 
appropriate for a court to raise lack of penal responsibility

 over a defendant’s objection.  See Jones, 664 P.2d at 1220 
(“[B]asic respect for a defendant’s individual freedom requires 
us to permit the defendant himself to determine his plea”).    
D. Glenn Did Not Present Sufficient Evidence of His Lack of 
Penal Responsibility to Require the Circuit Court to 
Instruct the Jury About the Defense 
 
Having established that the circuit court does not 
have a duty to instruct the jury on lack of penal responsibility 
when there is insufficient evidence offered at trial to support the instruction, we must determine whether there was sufficient 
evidence presented in this case.  We find that there was not.  
None of the examiners who concluded that Glenn lacked 
penal responsibility testified at trial, and the parties adduced 
no other direct evidence about Glenn’s mental health at the time 
of the offense.  We recognize that aspects of Glenn’s testimony 
were bizarre.  For instance, he explained that he was a “master 
mason,” that he had a lab at McDonald’s, and that he was 
studying “anatomic nuclei.”  However, Glenn’s bizarre statements during trial, without more, would not constitute evidence that 
Glenn lacked penal responsibility “as a result of physical or 
mental disease, disorder, or defect” at the time of the offense, 
and so it would have been futile for the jury to consider the 
defense.  Thus, the circuit court did not plainly err in failing 
to instruct the jury about lack of penal responsibility.

 V.  CONCLUSION
 
 In sum, we hold that the Hawaiʻ i Constitution protects 
defendants from being punished for committing a crime if they 
lack substantial capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of 
their actions or to conform their conduct to the requirements of 
the law; thus, lack of penal responsibility as a defense must be 
available to defendants as a matter of due process, and the 
decision to assert the defense is for the defendant alone.  For 
this reason, we hold prospectively that if the trial court 
receives notice that the defendant’s penal responsibility is an 
issue in the case, the court must conduct a colloquy with a 
defendant to ensure that a waiver of the defense is intelligent, knowing, and voluntary.  Finally, we hold that a trial court 
does not have a duty to sua sponte instruct a jury on lack of 
penal responsibility when there is insufficient evidence in the 
record to warrant such an instruction.  
 However, because we adopt the colloquy requirement 
prospectively, the trial court followed the rules in place at the time of Glenn’s conviction, and there is no evidence in the record that Glenn’s decision not to assert the defense was not a 
knowing, intelligent, or voluntary decision.  And, as there was 
insufficient evidence presented at trial to require an  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
43 
 instruction on lack of penal responsibility, the trial court had 
no duty to sua sponte instruct the jury.   
 Accordingly, we affirm Glenn’s conviction and the 
March 29, 2019 judgment of the ICA.
