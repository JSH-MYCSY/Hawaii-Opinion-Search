OPINION OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J.  
We address whether the State of Hawaiʻi (“State”) “incurred” 
attorney’
s fees under Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (“HRS”) § 658A-25  
  2

(2011)1 in a grievance arbitration when it was represented by an 
attorney employed by the State’s Department of Attorney General. 
The State sought $20,044.49 in appellate attorney’s fees and 
$35.20 in costs under HRS § 658A-25 as the “prevailing party” in an appeal of a grievance arbitration with the United Public Workers, AFSCME, Local 646, AFL-CIO (“UPW”). The Intermediate 
Court of Appeals (“ICA”) awarded costs but no attorney’s fees, 
on the grounds the State "failed to demonstrate that it incurred, as an expense, liability, or legal obligation to pay, appellate 
attorney’s fees[.]”
2 
We hold that the State “incurred” attorney’s fees for the 
purposes of HRS § 658A-25.  We grant the State’s request for 
attorney’s fees in the amount of $16,197.50. 
II. Background 
A. Underlying proceedings 
On April 13, 2015, UPW filed a grievance on behalf of an 
employee who had been discharged from his employment with the 
HRS § 658A- 25 provides, in relevant part: 
(c) On application of a prevailing party to a contested
judicial proceeding under section 658A- 22, 658A- 23, 
or 658A- 24, the court may add reasonable attorney’s fees 
and other reasonable expenses of litigation incurred in ajudicial proceeding after the award is made to a judgmentconfirming, vacating without directing a rehearing,modifying, or correcting an award. 
The State only appeals the ICA’s orders denying attorney’s fees and 
does not appeal the ICA’s memorandum opinion or judgment on the merits of the
case. 2

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
State.  UPW and the State entered arbitration. The State moved 
to dismiss the grievance based on procedural grounds. The 
arbitrator denied the motion to dismiss in a February 3, 2016 “Decision on Arbitrability.” 
On March 7, 2016, UPW filed a motion to confirm the 
Decision on Arbitrability in the Circuit Court of the First 
Circuit (“circuit court”).
3 The circuit court denied the motion, 
ruling that the Decision on Arbitrability was not an “award” 
subject to confirmation under HRS § 658A-22 (2011).4 
On June 20, 2016, the arbitrator issued a “Decision and 
Award,” reducing the employee’s discipline to 20 days suspension with no back pay. On July 8, 2016, UPW filed a “Motion to Confirm Arbitration Decisions and Awards, to Enter Final 
3 The Honorable Karen T. Nakasone presided. 
4 HRS § 658A- 22 provides: 
After a party to an arbitration proceeding receives notice 
of an award, the party may make a motion to the court foran order confirming the award at which time the court shall
issue a confirming order unless the award is modified or
corrected pursuant to section 658A- 20 or 6 58A- 24 or is 
vacated pursuant to section 658A- 23. 
In addition, HRS § 658A- 18 ( 2011) provides: 
If an arbitrator makes a pre -award ruling in favor of a 
party to the arbitration proceeding, the party may requestthe arbitrator to incorporate the ruling into an awardunder section 658A- 19. A prevailing party may make a motion
to the court for an expedited order to confirm the award 
under section 658A- 22, in which case the court shall 
summarily decide the motion. The court shall issue an orderto confirm the award unless the court vacates, modifies, orcorrects the award under section 658A- 23 or 658A- 24.

Judgment, and For Appropriate Relief.” UPW requested that the 
circuit court confirm both the Decision on Arbitrability and the 
Decision and Award pursuant to HRS § 658A-22,5 enter judgment on 
the arbitration award, and to grant UPW attorney’s fees and 
costs. On September 16, 2016, the circuit court partially granted and partially denied this motion.  It granted UPW’s 
request to confirm the Decision and Award, which incorporated 
the Decision on Arbitrability, but it denied a separate confirmation of the Decision on Arbitrability.  The circuit 
court also denied UPW’s request for costs and attorney’s fees. 
B. State’s request for attorney’s fees and costs 
UPW appealed the circuit court’s denial of its request to 
confirm the Decision on Arbitrability to the ICA.  The ICA affirmed the circuit court. United Public Workers, AFSCME, 
Local 646, AFL-CIO v. Dep’t of Transp., CAAP-16-0000666 (App. 
Mar. 13, 2020) (mem.). 
Then, on April 3, 2020, the State filed a request for 
appellate attorney’s fees and costs with the ICA, citing HRS 
§ 658A-25
6 and Hawai‘i Rules of Appellate Procedure (“HRAP”) Rule 
39(a) (2016).7 The State asserted entitlement to attorney’s fees 
5   See supra   note 4 for the text of HRS  §  658A- 22.

  5  
 
  
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
as the prevailing party for fees “incurred”   by the State’s 
attorney, who is employed by the State Department of Attorney 
General. The State pointed out the ICA had affirmed the circuit 
court’s orders in their entirety.   The State argued attorney’s 
fees may be awarded even if State attorneys are not paid on an  
hourly basis, and that Hawai‘i courts had awarded attorney’s fees  
in favor of and against government entities in the past.  
Similarly, 
Hawai‘i courts had awarded attorney’s fees to public 
interest attorneys, who, like State attorneys,   did not bill  
their clients.  
The State requested attorney’s fees using the “lodestar 
method” by multiplying an hourly rate of $325.00 by the hours 
spent on the appeal. 
The State’s attorney maintained he had 24 
years of experience, was an appellate specialist, and $325.00 
per hour was a reasonable rate based on attorney’s fees awarded 
in other cases.  The State thus requested a total of $20,044.49 in fees as well as $35.20 in costs. 
(. . . continued)
Except in criminal cases or as otherwise provided by law,
if an appeal or petition is dismissed, costs shall be taxed 
against the appellant or petitioner upon proper application
unless otherwise agreed by the parties or ordered by theappellate court; if a judgment is affirmed or a petitiondenied, costs shall be taxed against the appellant or petitioner unless otherwise ordered; if a judgment is
reversed or a petition granted, costs shall be taxed
against the appellee or the respondent unless otherwiseordered; if a judgment is affirmed in part and reversed inpart, or is vacated, or a petition granted in part and denied in part, the costs shall be allowed only as ordered
by the appellate court.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
UPW opposed the State’s request for attorney’s fees and 
costs, arguing the requested fees were unreasonable and that the 
hourly rate should be based on the State attorney’s salary, 
which it alleged was the actual expense the State “incurred.” 
The State’s reply contended that an award of “reasonable 
attorney’s fees” required the consideration of prevailing market 
rates. The State also pointed out this court had previously 
awarded fees to public interest attorneys based on reasonable hourly rates and had not limited fees to a share of the public 
interest attorney’s actual salary, citing Kaleikini v. Yoshioka, 
129 Hawai‘i 454, 304 P.3d 252 (2013).  
On July 6, 2020, the ICA issued an order granting the 
State’s request for costs but denying its request for attorney’s 
fees. The ICA ruled that while the State was entitled to 
attorney’s fees pursuant to HRS § 658A-25(c), it “failed to demonstrate that it actually ‘incurred’ appellate attorney’s fees.” The ICA cited Vinson v. Association of Apartment Owners 
of Sands of Kahana, 130 Hawai‘i 540, 548-49, 312 P.3d 1247, 1255-
56 (App. 2013), which had held that the prevailing party “must 
have paid or be legally obligated to pay such fees and costs” to its attorneys in order to have “incurred” fees. 
On July 16, 2020, the State filed a first amended request 
for attorney’s fees and costs further arguing it had “incurred” attorney’s fees.  As HRS Chapter 658A did not define “incur,”  
  7    
   
  
 
  
      
  
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the State cited Black’s Law Dictionary, which defined “incur” as, 
“[t]o suffer or bring on oneself (a liability or expense).” 
Incur, Black’s Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019). The State 
contended it had “suffered the liability” of spending 58.9 hours defending against UPW’s nonmeritorious appeal, which was time its attorney could have spent on other cases. 
The State distinguished Vinson, asserting that case 
involved private parties and attorneys, not government attorneys.  The State maintained the ICA’s interpretation of Vinson would 
“categorically deny[] attorney’s fees to the State,” which would 
contravene the purpose of HRS § 658A-25 to discourage nonmeritorious challenges. The State contended Vinson actually stood for the proposition that there must be a “sufficient legal 
connection” between the party and attorney “such that an 
attorney’s fees award . . . would not result in unjust enrichment.” The State asserted there was a sufficient legal 
connection here because government lawyers and their client 
agencies are both part of the State. 
On September 4, 2020, the ICA issued an order also denying 
the State’s first amended request for attorney’s fees and costs.  
The ICA again determined that the State “failed to demonstrate 
that it incurred, as an expense, liability, or legal obligation to pay, appellate attorney’s fees of $20,044.49.”

III. Standard of Review 
A. Statutory interpretation 
“Statutory interpretation is a question of law reviewable 
de novo.” State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai‘i 383, 390, 219 P.3d 1170, 
1177 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
This court’s construction of statutes is shaped by the 
following rules: 
First, the fundamental starting point for statutory 
interpretation is the language of the statute itself.Second, where the statutory language is plain andunambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain
and obvious meaning. Third, implicit in the task of
statutory construction is our foremost obligation toascertain and give effect to the intention of thelegislature, which is to be obtained primarily from thelanguage contained in the statute itself. Fourth, when
there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness 
or uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, anambiguity exists. 
Id. (quoting Citizens Against Reckless Dev. v. Zoning Bd. of 
Appeals of the City & Cty. of Honolulu, 114 Hawai‘i 184, 193–94, 
159 P.3d 143, 152
–53 (2007)).  “When there is ambiguity in a 
statute, ‘the meaning of the ambiguous words may be sought by 
examining the context, with which the ambiguous words, phrases, and sentences may be compared, in order to ascertain their true 
meaning.’”  Citizens Against Reckless Dev., 114 Hawai‘i at 194, 
159 P.3d at 153 (citations omitted). “Moreover, the courts may 
resort to extrinsic aids in determining legislative intent, such 
as legislative history, or the reason and spirit of the law.”

IV. Discussion 
The State’s Application presents two questions: 
[1]. Did the ICA commit grave errors or act inconsistently 
with prior case law by denying the State’s requests for 
appellate attorney’s fees based on an extreme and
irrational interpretation of the word “incur” that categorically denies attorney’s fees awards to government
attorneys? 
[2]. Did the ICA commit grave errors or act inconsistently 
with prior case law by failing to award attorney’s fees to 
the State according to the prevailing hourly rate? 
A. The State incurred attorney’s fees under HRS § 658A -25(c) 
The State argues it “incurred” attorney’s fees for purposes 
of HRS § 658A-25(c) because it spent 58.9 hours defending 
against UPW’s nonmeritorious appeal. The State maintains the 
ICA’s interpretation of Vinson would categorically deny 
attorney’s fees to the State, which is inconsistent with HRS 
§ 658A-25’s purpose of discouraging nonmeritorious challenges.  
HRS § 658A-25(c) provides: 
(c) On application of a prevailing party to a contested 
judicial proceeding under section 658A- 22, 658A- 23, 
or 658A- 24, the court may add reasonable attorney’s fees
and other reasonable expenses of litigation incurred in a 
judicial proceeding after the award is made to a judgment confirming, vacating without directing a rehearing,
modifying, or correcting an award. 
(Emphasis added.) Therefore, HRS § 658A-25(c) allows for the 
award of attorney’s fees and expenses “incurred” by a prevailing party in certain situations.  However, as the State notes, HRS ch. 658A does not define “incur.” Black’s Law Dictionary 
defines “incur” as “[t]o suffer or bring on oneself (a liability 
or expense).” Incur, Black’s Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019).  
  10   
 
  
 
      
   
 
  
  
 
   
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
 
 8 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Black’s Law Dictionary defines “liability” as “[t]he quality, 
state, or condition of being legally obligated[.]” Liability, 
Black’s Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019). 
As a matter of first impression, we agree with the State 
that it “incurred” attorney’s fees for the purposes of HRS 
§ 658A-25(c) based on the time its attorney spent on this case, 
which was time he could not spend on other cases. 
Other courts have also awarded attorney’s fees to 
government attorneys under similarly worded statutes.  For instance, in Wisconsin v. Hotline Industries, Inc., the Seventh 
Circuit Court of Appeals stated that “salaried government lawyers, like in-house and non-profit counsel, do incur expenses if the time and resources they devote to one case are not 
available for other work” in awarding attorney’s fees to the 
State of Wisconsin under 28 U.S.C. § 1446(c).
8 236 F.3d 363, 365 
(7th Cir. 2000) (emphasis added). The court also noted that, 
28 U.S.C. § 1446(c) (1996) provided: 
A motion to remand the case on the basis of any defect
other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be made within 30 days after the filing of the notice of removal
under section 1446(a). If at any time before final
judgment it appears that the district court lacks subjectmatter jurisdiction, the case shall be remanded. An order 
remanding the case may require payment of just costs and any actual expenses, including attorney fees, incurred as a
result of the removal . A certified copy of the order of
remand shall be mailed by the clerk to the clerk of the
State court. The State court may thereupon proceed with such case. 
(Emphasis added.)

“[t]o deny reimbursement under these circumstances would 
indirectly penalize the institution, be it public or private, 
for providing its own legal counsel throughout a case.” 236 
F.3d at 366. See also Bond v. Blum, 317 F.3d 385, 400 (4th Cir. 2003) (“[A] State’s own attorneys representing the State may be awarded attorneys fees under a fee-shifting statute.”), 
abrogated on other grounds by Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, 
Inc., 136 S.Ct. 1979 (2016). 
Similarly, courts have also awarded attorney’s fees to 
public interest attorneys and to in-house counsel even when those attorneys did not charge their clients an hourly rate. See Bond, 317 F.3d at 400 (“[I]n-house counsel representing the corporation for whom they work may also be awarded attorneys 
fees.”); Textor v. Bd. of Regents of Northern Illinois Univ., 
711 F.2d 1387, 1397 (7th Cir. 1983) (reasoning that in-house counsel incurred attorney’s fees because “for every hour in-
house counsel spent on this case defendants lost an hour of 
legal services that could have been spent on other matters”); 
Sierra Club v. Dep’t. of Transp., 120 Hawai‘i 181, 202 P.3d 1226 
(2009) 
(awarding attorney’s fees to the Sierra Club); Wiginton v. 
Pac. Credit Corp., 2 Haw. App. 435, 446, 634 P.2d 111, 120 (App. 
1981) (awarding attorney’s fees to the Legal Aid Society of  
  12  
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Hawai‘i);9 Softsolutions, Inc. v. Brigham Young Univ., 1 P.3d 
1095, 1106 (Utah 2000) (“[W]e are persuaded by the ample 
authority from other jurisdictions that a successful litigant 
who is not primarily engaged in providing legal services may 
recover attorney fees when represented by salaried in -house 
counsel.”). 
Also, this case is distinguishable from Vinson.  Vinson 
ruled that the client would be entitled to attorney’s fees under HRS § 658A-25(c) if he could show that he was legally obligated 
to pay the fees of the law firm representing him. 130 Hawai‘i at 
548- 
49, 312 P.3d at 1255-56.  The ICA based its holding on the 
reasoning that the client should not receive a windfall if they 
did not pay for their attorney’s work. 130 Hawai‘i at 548, 312 
P.3d at 1255 (citing Wiginton, 2 Haw. App. at 446-47, 634 P.2d at 120 (holding a client represented by the Legal Aid Society of 
Hawai‘i could be awarded attorney’s fees if they were obligated 
to pay Legal Aid whatever fees they received)). Unlike Vinson, 
the client in this case, the State, actually pays its attorney. 
Like the Wiginton case cited in Vinson, the State would receive 
The State’s Application notes that Legal Aid attorneys now require
their clients to sign formal retainer agreements providing that Legal Aid
will be allowed to keep attorney’s fees awarded to the client, even when theclient does not pay for legal services.  However, we do not require public interest attorneys to enter into formal retainer agreements with their
clients in order to recover attorney’s fees under HRS § 658A -25(c). 9  
  13  
 
    
  
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
whatever fees awarded for fees “incurred” by the attorney in 
this case. 
We therefore hold that attorney’s fees may be “incurred” 
for the purposes of HRS § 658A-25(c), even if the attorney did not charge their client on an hourly basis, “if the time and resources they devote to one case are not available for other 
work.”  Hotline Industries, Inc., 236 F.3d at 365. Therefore, 
the State sufficiently demonstrated that it incurred attorney’s fees in this case. 
While an award of attorney’s fees is appropriate in this 
case, HRS § 658A-25(c) specifically provides that courts “may add reasonable attorney’s fees and other reasonable expenses of litigation incurred[.]”  Therefore, we note that courts still 
have discretion to grant or deny requests for attorney’s fees 
under the statute. In this case, however, the fees were erroneously denied on the grounds they were not “incurred.” B. “Reasonable attorney’s fees” are determined based on
prevailing market rates 
The State also argues attorney’s fees should be awarded 
based on prevailing market rates, not the government attorney’s actual salary. The State asserts an hourly rate of $325.00 was reasonable in this case. 
HRS § 658A-25(c) provides that courts may award “reasonable 
attorney’s fees and other reasonable expenses of litigation  
  14  
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
   
 
   
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
incurred[.]” (Emphasis added.) “This court employs the 
‘lodestar’ method in determining a reasonable attorney’s fee.”  
Kaleikini, 129 Hawai‘i at 469, 304 P.3d at 267.  “Under the 
lodestar method, the court multiplies the number of hours 
reasonably expended by a reasonable hourly rate.” Id. 
Additionally, this court calculates “reasonable hourly rates” 
according to “prevailing market rates in the relevant community.”  
129 Hawai‘i at 472, 304 P.3d at 270; see Gurrobat v. HTH Corp., 
135 Hawai‘
i 128, 139, 346 P.3d 197, 208 (2015); Cty. of Hawai‘i v. 
C&J Coupe Family Ltd., 120 Hawai‘i 400, 407, 208 P.3d 713, 720 
(2009). Therefore, an award of reasonable attorney’s fees to 
the State would be calculated based on the prevailing market 
rates in the community. 
The State maintains a $325.00 hourly rate is reasonable for 
its attorney who had 24 years of experience and was an appellate specialist. The State cited Kaleikini, in which this court determined $300.00 was a reasonable hourly rate for a local 
attorney with 20 years of experience. 129 
Hawai‘i at 473, 304 
P.3d at 271. 
The State also cited a request for attorney’s fees filed in 
another case by the attorney representing UPW in this case.  See 
In re HSTA, 140 Hawai‘i 381, 400 P.3d 582 (2017). UPW’s 
attorney’s request, which was included as one of the State’s 
exhibits, 
noted she had over 20 years of experience in

employment law, and that the hourly rate of law partners 
specializing in labor and employment law ranged from between 
$280.00 to $480.00. UPW’s attorney requested an hourly rate of 
$275.00, which this court granted. We therefore determine that $275.00 is a reasonable hourly rate for the State’s attorney in this case. Hence, we grant the State’s request for attorney’s 
fees in the amount of $16,197.50 (58.9 hours x $275.00 per hour). 
V. Conclusion 
We therefore reverse the ICA’s July 6, 2020 and September 4, 
2020 orders denying the State attorney’s fees and grant the 
State $16,197.50 in attorney’s fees. The ICA’s judgment on appeal is otherwise affirmed. Jonathan E. Spiker,
