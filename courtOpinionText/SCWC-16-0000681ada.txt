OPINION OF THE COURT BY POLLACK, J. 
 
  Donald Nicol was charged in the Circuit Court of the 
First Circuit (circuit court) with multiple counts of sexual 
assault.  Due to pretrial delay, the circuit court dismissed the 
case without prejudice pursuant to Hawaii Rules of Penal Electronically Filed

2 Procedure (HRPP) Rule 48 (2012) and  the three -factor analysis of 
State v. Estencion , 63 Haw. 264, 625 P.2d 1040 (1981).  Nicol 
appealed the circuit court’s order to the Intermediate Court of 
Appeals (ICA), arguing that the circuit court erred in 
dismissing the case without  prejudice, thereby permitting 
reprosecution of the charges.   The ICA dismissed the appeal for 
lack of appellate jurisdiction based on its conclusion that the 
Hawaii Revised Statutes did not permit Nicol’s appeal .  Thus, 
the sole issue before this court is whether a defendant has the 
right to appeal a circuit court order dismissing a case without 
prejudice. 
  
We hold that, under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 
641-11 (Supp. 2004), a defendant may appeal from an order of the 
circuit court dismissing 
the proceedings without prejudice, and 
the ICA therefore possessed jurisdiction over Nicol’s appeal.  
Accordingly, we  remand the case to the ICA for resolution of the 
merits of Nicol’s appellate claim. 
I. CIRCUIT COURT PROCEEDINGS 
  On October 14, 2014, Nicol was charged by indictment 
with four counts of sexual assault in the first degree in 
violation of HRS § 707
-730(1)(b) (Supp. 2013), four counts of 
sexual assault in the second degree in violation of HRS § 707-***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
3 731(1)(a) (Supp. 2013), and two counts of sexual assault in the 
fourth degree in violation of HRS § 707- 733(1)(a) (Supp. 2013).1   
  On October 20, 2014, at arraignment, Nicol pleaded not 
guilty to the charges.  T rial was continued multiple times to 
resolve issues relating to discovery and various motions in 
limine, to secure the presence of anticipated witnesses, to rule 
on Nicol’s motion to dismiss the indictment based on 
insufficient evidence, to reassign the case following recusal of 
the presiding judge, and to address the court’s scheduling 
conflicts.2  For certain periods of this time, Nicol waived his 
right to a speedy trial.   
  On June 7, 2016, Nicol  moved to dismiss the indictment 
based in part  on alleged violation s of his rights under HRPP  
Rule 48, which requires a court to dismiss criminal charges when 
trial has not commenced within six months from the date of 
arrest if bail is set.  Nicol further contended  that, pursuant 
to the three- factor test set forth by this court in State v. 
                                                           
 1 The indictment also reflects three additional counts of sexual 
assault in the first degree that were stricken.  Additionally, one of the  
second-degree sexual assault counts was subsequently dismissed by the circuit 
court by order dated April 13, 2015.   
 2 The record reflects that the Honorable Colette Y. Garibaldi was 
assigned to preside over the proceedings following the recusal of the 
Honorable Dexter D. Del Rosario, with the exception of the motion to dismiss 
proceeding, which was held before the Honorable Paul B.K. Wong.     ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
4 Estencion, 63 Haw. 264, 625 P.2d 1040 (1981), he was entitled to 
dismissal with prejudice.3   
  On September 16, 2016, the circuit court entered its 
Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Defendant Donald 
Nicol’s Motion to Dismiss Indictment With Prejudice (Order of 
Dismissal).  With respect to Nicol ’s argument based on HRPP Rule  
48, the court concluded that the applicable period of delay 
exceeded six months, thereby violating HRPP Rule 48 and 
requiring dismissal of the charges.  The circuit court further 
concluded that dismissal without prejudice was the appropriate 
remedy based on its application of the three-factor test set 
forth in Estencion, 63 Haw. 264, 625 P.2d 1040.   
II. ICA PROCEEDINGS 
  Following Nicol’s appeal of the Order of Dismissal to 
the ICA, the State filed a  Counterstatement of Jurisdiction 
arguing that the ICA lacked appellate jurisdiction to review the 
circuit court’s order .  The State contended that the right of 
appeal in a criminal case must be granted by statute and that no 
statute afforded  Nicol the right to appeal an order dismissing 
proceedings without prejudice.  The State contended that circuit 
                                                           
 3 Nicol also contended that the delay in commencing the trial 
violated his state and federal constitutional rights to a speedy trial, which 
argument the circuit court rejected.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
5 court defendants may only appeal from the following : (1) “the 
sentence of the court in a criminal case ” based on  HRS § 641- 11 
(Supp. 2004), which sets forth the right of appeal in circuit 
court criminal cases;  (2) a certified interlocutory order 
pursuant to HRS § 641- 17 (1993) ;4 or (3) an order denying a 
motion to dismiss based on double jeopardy principles.  
According to the State, none of these bases applied in Nicol’s 
case to permit the ICA’s review of the Order of Dismissal.   
  In Nicol’s Statement of Jurisdiction, he submitted  
that the ICA did in fact have jurisdiction to review the merits 
of his appeal.  Nicol maintained  that HRS § 641- 11 contained an 
“ambiguity as to what constitutes an appealable judgment or 
order of the circuit court.”  Nicol stated that this court had 
interpreted HRS § 641- 12 (Supp. 2004) to grant district court 
defendants the right to appeal a district court order dismissing 
charges without prejudice.  Nicol  also asserted that this court 
had previously held that, pursuant to HRS § 641- 13 (Supp. 2006),  
                                                           
 4 The State further submits on certiorari that Nicol had the right 
to seek the circuit court’s permission for an interlocutory appeal under HRS 
§ 641-17 in this case, but that he failed to do so.  Nicol responds that he 
had no such right because  interlocutory review of an order terminating a case 
would be inappropriate and HRS § 641 -17 only permits defendants to seek 
interlocutory review of a decision denying a motion to dismiss.   
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
6 the State  may appeal an order of dismissal from  both the 
district and circuit court in criminal cases.   
  Nicol  thus reasoned that the ability of a  district 
court defendant and the State to appeal an order of dismissal 
shows that an order dismissing proceedings without prejudice 
constitutes a final order or decision which is ripe for appeal.  
Nicol also contended that an interpretation of the statutes as 
prohibiting circuit court defendants from appealing orders of 
dismissal yet granting such right of appeal to similarly-
situated district court defendants would result in a violation 
of Nicol’s constitutional right to equal protection of the laws.  
According to Nicol, HRS § 641 -11 must be interpreted in a manner 
that does not lead to this “unreasonable,” “ absurd,” and 
“unconstitutional” result.    
  On January 11, 2017, the ICA issued an Order 
Dismissing the Appeal f or Lack of Appellate Jurisdiction (Order 
Dismissing the Appeal).  The ICA stated that the case was 
dismissed without prejudice by the circuit court based on a 
violation of HRPP Rule 48, an d, therefore, “no sentence ha[d] 
been imposed.”  The ICA thus concluded that it lacked appellate 
jurisdiction “because there is no ‘judgment’ in the record on 
appeal as defined by [HRS] § 641- 11 (2010).”  As a result, the 
ICA determined that Nicol  was not entitled to a review of the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
7 circuit court’s Order of Dismissal under HRS § 641 -11 and 
dismissed Nicol’s appeal .   
III.  STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
  “The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law 
that we review de novo under the right/wrong standard. ”  Lingle 
v. Haw. Gov ’t Emps. Ass’n, 107 Hawai i 178, 182, 111 P.3d 587, 
591 (2005).  Additionally, “[t] he interpretation of a statute is 
a question of law reviewable de novo .”  State v. Arceo , 84 
Hawaii 1, 10, 928 P.2d 843, 852 (1996) (quoting State v. Camara , 
81 Hawaii 324, 329, 916 P.2d 1225, 1230 (1996)).    
IV. DISCUSSION 
  On certiorari, Nicol  contends that the ICA improperly 
dismissed his appeal of the circuit court’s Order of Dismissal 
based on a “limited reading ” and “uncritical interpretation” of 
the term “judgment” in HRS § 641-11.  The State responds that 
the circuit court’s Order of Dismissal is not a “judgment” 
within the meaning of HRS § 641 -11 because it is not “ a 
sentence,” and, therefore, no jurisdictional basis exists to 
permit 
Nicol’s appeal in this case .5   
                                                           
 5 At oral argument, however, counsel for the State expressed that 
“with regard to the jurisdictional issue, the State’s actually in agreement 
with Petitioner.”  See  Oral Argument at 23:09 -20, State v. Nicol, SCWC- 16-
0000681 (argued July 18, 2017), http://oaoa.hawaii.gov/
jud/oa/17/SCOA_071817_SCWC_16_681.mp3 .  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
8   “The right of appeal in a criminal case is purely 
statutory and exists only when given by some constitutional or 
statutory provision.”   State v. Kalani , 87 Hawai i 260, 261, 953 
P.2d 1358, 1359 (1998) (quoting State v. Fukusaku , 85 Hawai i 
462, 490, 946 P.2d 32, 60 (1997)).  Under the Hawaii Revised 
Statutes, the right to appeal in criminal cases is generally 
divided into three categories: the right to appeal from the 
circuit courts, the right to appeal from the district courts, 
and the State’s right to appeal in both the district and circuit 
courts.  See generally  HRS § 641 -11 (Supp. 2004) (circuit 
courts); HRS § 641-12 (Supp. 2004) (district courts); HRS § 641-
13 (Supp. 2006) (State’s right to appeal) .  The Hawaii Revised 
Statutes also provide a specific  statutory basis for the right 
of circuit court defendants to seek interlocutory appeals.  See 
HRS § 641- 17 (Supp. 2004).   
  In addition to the rights of appeal set forth in 
chapter 641, this court has on several occasions stated that its 
statutory supervisory powers set forth in HRS § 602- 4 (1993)6 may 
provide it with an independent jurisdictional basis to “prevent 
and correct error and abuses where no other remedy is expressly 
                                                           
 6 HRS § 602 -4 (1993) states that “[t]he supreme court shall hav e 
the general superintendence of all courts of inferior jurisdiction to prevent 
and correct errors and abuses therein where no other remedy is expressly 
provided by law.” ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
9 provided for by law.”  State v. Ui, 66 Haw. 366, 370, 663 P.2d 
630, 633 (1983) (observing that although this court  may have 
lacked jurisdiction under HRS § 641-11, it had authority under 
HRS § 602-4 to invoke its supervisory powers to entertain an 
appeal); see also State v. Kealaiki, 95 Hawai i 309, 317, 22 P.3d 
588, 596 (2001); State v. Johnson , 96 Hawai i 462, 471, 32 P.3d 
7106, 115 (App. 2001).  
A. Right of Appeal of Circuit Court Defendants 
  Our analysis begins with HRS § 641- 11, which sets 
forth the right to appeal from the circuit courts and provides 
as follows: 
Any party aggrieved by the judgment of a circuit court in a 
criminal matter may appeal to the intermediate appellate 
court, subject to chapter 602, in the manner and within the 
time provided by the rules of court.  The sentence of the 
court in a criminal case shall be the judgment.  All 
appeals shall be filed with the clerk of the supreme court 
and shall be subject to one filing fee.  
HRS § 641-11  (emphases added).  Thus, under HRS § 641 -11, a 
party aggrieved by the “judgment” of a circuit court may  appeal 
                                                           
 7 Additionally, although not founded in statute, this court has 
held that certain appeals may be brought pursuant to the “collateral order” 
exception.  Kealaiki, 95 Hawai i at 316– 17, 22 P.3d at 595 –96.  Pursuant to 
this doctrine, an order or decision of the court may be appealable if it : 
“(1) fully disposes of the question at issue; (2) resolves an issue 
completely collateral to the merits of the case; and (3) involves important 
rights which would be irreparably lost if review had to await a final 
judgment.”  Id. (quoting State v. Baranco, 77 Hawai i 351, 353- 54, 884 P.2d 
729, 731- 32 (1994) (applying the collateral order exception to hold that a 
defendant may take an interlocutory appeal of an order denying a pretrial 
motion to dismiss based on double jeopardy grounds)).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
10 to the intermediate appellate court.  Id.  The statute also 
states that the “sentence” shall constitute the “judgment.”  Id.   
  At  issue in this case is whether the  statutory clause 
identifying the “sentence” as the “judgment” precludes circuit 
court defendants from appealing an order of dismissal without 
prejudice.  “When construing a statute, [this court’ s] foremost 
obligation is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of 
the legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the 
language contained in the statute itself.”   State v. McKnight , 
131 Hawai i 379, 388, 319 P.3d 298, 307 (2013) (alteration in 
original) (quoting State v. Kotis, 91 Hawai i 319, 327, 984 P.2d 
78, 86 (1999)) .  Additionally, “[t] he legislative history of a 
statute remains relevant ‘ even when the language appears clear 
upon perfunctory review.’”   State v. Alangcas , 134 Hawai i 515, 
526, 345 P.3d 181, 192 (2015) (quoting Richardson v. City & Cty. 
of Honolulu , 76 Hawai i 46, 68-69, 868 P.2d 1193, 1215- 16 
(1994)).  “Were this not the case, a court may be unable to 
adequately discern the underlying policy which the legislature 
seeks to promulgate and, thus, would be unable to determine if a 
literal construction would produce an absurd or unjust result, 
inconsistent with the policies of the statute. ”  Id. (quoting 
Richardson , 76 Hawai i at 68-69, 868 P.2d at 1215- 16). ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
11   The substance of HRS § 641- 11 dates back to at least 
1892, and, prior to the legislative session of 1925, its 
predecessor statute provided that a writ of error could be 
issued to “any party deeming himself aggrieved by the judgment 
of a circuit court, the land court, or a district magistrate, or 
by the order or decree of a circuit judge at chambers  . . . 
within six months from the entry of such judgment, order or 
decree.”  Revised Laws of Hawaii (RLH) § 2521 (1925).  The 
territorial legislature in 1925 amended the statute, however, to 
include the clause at issue in this case.  The a mended statute 
provided in relevant part as follows: 
A writ of error . . . may be issued . . . upon the 
application of any party deeming himself aggrieved by the 
judgment of a circuit court, the land court, or a district 
magistrate, or by the order or decree of a circuit judge at 
chambers . . . within six months from the entry of such 
judgment, order or decree and the sentence of the court in 
a criminal case shall be the judgment . 
1925 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 211, § 1 at 255 -56 (emphasis added).   
  In its committee report, the Senate Committee on 
Judiciary (Committee) stated that the 1925 amendment was 
intended to “more clearly define[] the time within which” 
defendants could seek a writ of error in criminal cases.  S. 
Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 181, in 1925 Senate J ournal, at 550.  The 
Committee elaborated that under both the previous and amended 
versions of the statute, individuals were permitted to seek such 
a writ in criminal cases “within six months from the entry of ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
12 judgment[].”  Id.  at 551.  However, the Committee was concerned 
that there was ambiguity as to when the relevant six- month 
period began to run.  Id.  The Committee noted that courts had 
generally treated the sentence in a criminal case as the 
relevant “entry of judgment” for purpo ses of computing the six-
month period, but it also noted that there had been “a doubt as 
to the correctness of such a construction.”  Id.  The Committee 
determined that the sentence of the court was indeed the 
relevant event by which to measure the six- month window, and, 
therefore, it specifically identified the “sentence” as the 
“judgment” in its amendment to codify this interpretation of the 
statute.  Id.  Thus, the legislative history surrounding the 
1925 amendment to the statute classifying the “sentence ” as the 
“judgment” indicates that the legislature intended not to narrow 
the scope of decisions and orders from which defendants could 
appeal, but, rather, to more clearly establish the relevant 
timeframe within which defendants could do so. 
  This court ’s understanding of HRS § 641 -11 is further 
informed by our jurisdiction’s caselaw , which suggests that 
considerations of finality are the primary focus in resolving 
questions of appealability under the statute.  In State v. 
Johnston , for example, this court ruled that a circuit court 
order denying a motion to dismiss was not appealable under HRS § ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
13 641-11 in part because the order--which did not terminate 
proceedings in the case-- was deemed to be of an interlocutory 
nature.  63 Haw. 9, 10, 619 P.2d 1076, 1077 (1980).  The 
Johnston court concluded that the order denying the motion to 
dismiss was “not a final order or judgment ,” and it was 
therefore not appealable under the statute.  Id.  Although the 
court considered the language of HRS § 641-11 that “[t]he 
sentence of the court in a criminal case shall be the judgment ,” 
it did not conclude that jurisdiction was lacking based on the 
absence of a “sentence”; rather, this court focused on the fact 
that denial of a motion to dismiss permitted proceedings to move 
forward and therefore lacked finality.  Id. ; see also  State v. 
Ferreira , 54 Haw. 485, 486- 87, 510 P.2d 88, 89  (1973) (appeal 
not permitted under HRS § 641- 11 where judgment of conviction 
lacked any indication that sentencing had occurred and where the 
record suggested that “the judgment in [the] case [was] not 
final”). 
  In  Ui, this court again considered the scope of HRS § 
641-11 and elaborated that an appeal need not necessarily be 
from a “sentence” for principles of finality to warrant its 
adjudication.  66 Haw. at 368-69, 663 P.2d at  631-32.  In that 
case, following a mistrial and dismissal of the indictment with 
prejudice, the defendant’s court -appointed counsel sought an ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
14 order awarding attorneys’ fees.  Id. at 368, 663 P.2d at 631.   
After the circuit court issued the order granting counsel a 
portion of the fees he sought, the defendant appealed the 
attorneys’ fees order and submitted that jurisdiction under HRS 
§ 641-11 was proper.  Id.  On appeal, the State cited to 
Johnston, 63 Haw. 9, 619 P.2d 1076, and argued  that an appeal 
under the statute could only be taken “from a sentence of the 
circuit court.”  Id. at 369, 663 P.2d at 632.  The Ui court 
distinguished Johnston , explaining that “ Johnston  did not 
definitively rule that an appeal under HRS § 641- 11 must be from 
a sentence in a criminal case.”  Id.  Rather, this court 
considered Johnston  to imply that “an appeal may also be brought 
from an order deemed to be final .”  Id.  The Ui court 
determined, however, that it need not expressly rule on this 
issue because the defendant lacked standing to challenge the 
8order awarding his counsel attorneys’ fees.   Id. at 369-70, 663 
P.2d at 632-33 (reasoning that the defendant was not personally 
“aggrieved” by the attorneys’ fees order within the meaning of 
HRS § 641-11). 
                                                           
 8 Although the Ui court later stated in the context of another 
possible jurisdictional basis that it “lack[ed] jurisdiction under HRS § 641 -
11,” the court concluded that it “[did] not need to decide this issue” (i.e., 
“whether the judgment appealed from must be a sentence”).  66 Haw. at 369 -70, 
663 P.2d at 632- 33.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
15   We again considered principles of finality as they 
related to appeals in Kalani, where this court discussed the 
differences  between a grant and a denial of a defendant’s moti on 
to dismiss.  87 Hawaii at 261-62, 953 P.2d at  1359-60.  In 
Kalani, we considered whether the State was entitled to appeal 
an order of dismissal without prejudice pursuant to HRS § 641-
913.   Id.  at 261, 953 P.2d at 1359.  After determining that the 
statute and its caselaw indicated that the State was entitled to 
appeal such an order, this court observed the possible 
applicability of Johnston , which it construed as indicating that 
“in a criminal case, an appeal must be from a ‘final order or 
judgment. ’”  Id. (quoting Johnston, 63 Haw. at 11, 619 P.2d at 
1077).  Although the Kalani court ultimately concluded that 
Johnston possessed minimal persuasive authority because it was 
based on a different statute, it reasoned that the order in 
                                                           
 9 HRS § 641 -13 provides in relevant part as follows:  
 An appeal may be taken by and on behalf of the State 
from the district or circuit courts to the intermediate 
appellate court, subject to chapter 602, in all criminal 
matters, in the following instances:  
(1) From an order or judgment quashing, setting 
 aside, or sustaining a motion to dismiss  any 
indictment, information, or complaint  or any 
count thereof . . . .  
HRS § 641- 13 (Supp. 2006).   
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
16 Johnston denying a motion to dismiss differed from the order at 
issue, which granted a  motion to dismiss and  effectively 
terminated proceedings.  Id.  at 261– 62, 953 P.2d at 1359 –60.   
When dismissal is denied in a criminal case, the circuit 
court conducts further proceedings and, presumably, the 
case eventually goes to trial.  Thus, an order denying  a 
motion to dismiss is not final.  The present case, however, 
involved an order granting a motion to dismiss.  If 
dismissal is
 granted,  there is nothing further to be 
accomplished in the trial court and the proceedings are 
ended.  Thus, an order granting  a motion to dismiss is 
final. 
Id.  The Kalani court further observed that if the State chose 
to recharge a defendant following an order dismissing 
proceedings without prejudice, “recharging [the defendant] does 
not revive the original case.”   Id. at 262, 953 P.2d at 1360.  
“Rather, recharging the defendant initiates a new case,” and, 
therefore, “a dismissal without prejudice is a final order -it 
terminates the current case.”  Id.   
  An emphasis on finality is also present in State v. 
Lawrence, 139 Hawai i 192, 386 P.3d 476 (App. 2016), in which the 
ICA held that a judgment of acquittal and commitment based on an 
insanity defense constituted a “sentence” for purposes of HRS § 
641-11.  In  Lawrence , the defendant was found not guilty by 
reason of mental disease, disorder, or defect following a bench 
trial.  139 Hawai i at 194-95, 386 P.3d at 478- 79.  Accordingly, 
the court issued a judgment of acquittal and an order committing 
the defendant to the care and custody of the director of health ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
17 to be placed in an appropriate institution.  Id. at 195, 386 
P.3d at 479.  Following entry of the judgment of acquittal, the 
defendant sought to appeal one of
 a series of orders issued by 
the circuit court authorizing his involuntary medication while 
in the State’s custody .  Id. at 195-99, 386 P.3d at 4 79-83.   
  In considering whether his appeal was permissible 
under HRS § 641-11, the ICA observed several instances in which 
this court had “implicitly held” that orders regarding 
involuntary treatment and medication were “appealable orders .”  
Id. at 199-200, 386 P.3d at 483-84 (citing Kotis, 91 Hawaii 319, 
984 P.2d 78 (appeal of a pretrial involuntary order of 
medication); State v. Miller , 84 Hawaii 269, 933 P.2d 606 (1997) 
(appeal of an order denying petition for conditional release 
following acquittal on the ground of mental disease or disorder 
and commitment to state custody
); State v. Burgo , 71 Haw. 198,  
787 P.2d 221 (1990) (appeal of an order revoking grant of 
conditional release following acquittal and commitment to state 
custody)).  The Lawrence court additionally considered that a 
defendant found not guilty based on an insanity defense who was 
committed to the custody of the State may be subject to 
deprivation of liberty “for a prolonged, and indeed an 
indefinite, period of time.”  Id. at 200, 386 P.3d at 484.  The 
court reasoned that it would be “anomalous” to preclude an ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
appeal “under the circumstances of [the] case” and suggested 
that interpreting HRS § 641-11 to prohibit the appeal would 
yield absurd results.  Id. at 201, 386 P.3d at 485 (citing 
Burgo, 71 Haw. at 202, 787 P.2d at 223).  Thus, the ICA 
determined that the judgment of acquittal and commitment 
constituted a “sentence” for purposes of HRS § 641 -11 given its 
nature and finality.  Id.  at 200-01, 386 P. 3d at 484-85 (also 
holding that the order authorizing involuntary medication was an 
appealable post-judgment order). 
18   In keeping with this  focus on finality, we have also 
interpreted HRS § 641- 11 to bar  an appeal of orders  that do not 
represent final decisions of the court or otherwise terminate 
proceedings.  In Kealaiki , for example, this court considered 
whether a circuit court order granting a deferred acceptance of 
no contest (DANC) plea was appealable under HRS § 641-11.  95 
Hawaii at 311-12, 22 P.3d at  590-91.  The court explained that 
in general, if a DANC plea is  granted by order of the circuit 
court, “acceptance of the plea is then deferred,” further 
proceedings are suspended pending the defendant’s satisfaction 
of certain conditions, and, upon “[s]uccessful completion of the 
deferral period,” the charges are dis missed.  Id. at 315, 22 
P.3d at 594.  T he defendant in Kealaiki had sought to appeal the 
circuit court’s order accepting his DANC plea, but prior to ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
19 completion of the deferral period; as such, the criminal charges 
remained pending at the time of appeal.  I d. at 312, 22 P.3d at 
591.  This court reasoned that given the nature of the deferred 
plea procedure, an order granting a DANC plea was neither a 
conviction nor a sentence.  Id. at 312
-13, 22 P.3d at 591-92.  
The Kealaiki court therefore concluded that an appeal of an 
order granting a DANC plea pending the deferral period was not 
authorized by HRS § 641- 11.  Id.  at 312, 22 P.3d at 591. 
  D ecisions of this jurisdiction thus demonstrate that 
our courts have not rigidly interpreted appealability pursuant 
to HRS § 641-11.   Rather, we have looked to considerations of 
finality and determined whether the order or decision terminated 
proceedings, 
leaving “nothing further to be accomplished in the 
trial court.”  
Kalani, 87 Hawai i at 261–62, 953 P.2d at 1359 –60; 
see also Johnston, 63 Haw. at  10, 619 P.2d at  1077; Ui, 66 Haw.

P.3d at 590-91.   Such an interpretation of HRS § 641 -11 is 
consistent with the legislative intent behind the statute’s 
language identifying the “sentence” as the “judgment” in circuit 
court proceedings, which was not intended to limit the scope of 
permissible appeals under the statute, but,  rather, to more 
clearly establish the timeline in which an appeal could be ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

B. Right of Appeal of District Court Defendants and       
of the State
     
  Reference to the analogous rights of appeal of 
district court defendants and of the S tate in both district and 
circuit court cases is also appropriate in analyzing Nicol ’s 
right to appeal in this case because “[l] aws in pari materia , or 
upon the same subject matter, shall be construed with reference 
to each other.”  Richardson v. City & Ct
y. of Honolulu , 76 
Hawaii 46, 55, 868 P.2d 1193, 1202 (1994) (alteration in 
original) (quoting HRS § 1-16 (1985)). 
  HRS § 641- 13 (Supp. 2006) provides a listing of 
orders, rulings, and decisions of both the district and circuit 
courts from which the State may appeal, including “an order or 
judgment quashing, setting aside, or sustaining a motion to 
dismiss.”  HRS § 641 -13(1).  Our court has interpreted this 
language of HRS § 641- 13 to permit the State to appeal an order 
dismissing proceedings without prejudice.  See Kalani, 87 
Hawaii 
at 261, 953 P.2d at 1359 (“[T] he plain meaning of [HRS § 641-
13(1)] indicates that the prosecution can appeal from both 
dismissals with prejudice and without prejudice. ”).    ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
  HRS § 641- 12 sets forth the right to appeal for 
district court defendants and provides in relevant part as 
follows:   
21 Appeals upon the record shall be allowed from all final 
decisions and final judgments of district courts  in all 
criminal matters.  Such appeals may be made to the 
intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 602, 
whenever the party appealing shall file notice of the 
party’s appeal within thirty days, or such other time as 
may be provided by the rules of the court.  
HRS § 641-12 (Supp. 2004) (emphasis added).  T hus, district 
court defendants may appeal from “all final decisions and final 
judgments.”  Id. 
  The difference in standards between the appeals 
provisions relating to district court and circuit court 
defendants originated by virtue of statutory amendment and 
appears to have been a byproduct of a 1972 legislative updating 
of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.  Prior to 1972 and dating back 
to the late 1800s, Hawai i law provided for both appeals and for 
writs of errors.  Appeals were permitted from “all decisions” of 
“district magistrates” in civil and criminal cases pursuant to 
section 2508 of the Revised Laws of Hawaii , see RLH § 2508 
(1925), and appeals were likew ise permitted from all “decisions, 
judgments, orders or decrees” of “circuit judges in chambers” 
under section 2509,
 see RLH § 2509 (1925).  Under RLH § 2521 
(1925), writs of error could be sought by “any party deeming 
himself aggrieved by the judgment of a circuit court, the land ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
22 court, or a district magistrate, or by the order or decree of a 
circuit judge at chambers . . . within six months from the entry 
of such judgment, order or decree.”  Thus, separate statutory 
bases existed to permit appeals from district courts and from 
circuit courts, and a separate, single statute set the terms by 
which parties could seek writs of error from all lower courts.  
Our statutes maintained the distinction between appeals and 
writs or error for many decades. 
  In 1972, the Hawai i Legislature conducted a “long 
overdue” “[c]omprehensive updating and unifying” of the Hawaii 
Revised Statutes.  S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 622- 72, in 1972 
Senate Journal, at 1006.  The resulting legislation (Act 89) was 
the product of work done by the Committee on Coordination of 
Rules and Statutes and sought to address “[o]bsolete civil 
procedure provisions” dating back to the 1800s.  Id.  Act 89 
removed the distinction in our statutes between “appeals” and 
“writs of errors” and consolidated the t wo categories into one 
chapter (“Appeals”) , which was divided into the two subparts 
currently found in the Hawaii Revised Statutes (“Appeals in 
Civil Actions and Proceedings” and “Appeals in Criminal 
Proceedings”).  Within the subpart “Appeals in Criminal 
Proceedings,” Act 89 set forth the three subsections  that exist 
in the present day: appeals from the circuit courts, appeals ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
23 from the district courts, and appeals by the State in criminal 
cases.  1972 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 89, § 5 at 348- 49.   
  
To define the right of appeal of circuit court 
defendants, Act 89 borrowed from the previous language relating 
to writs of error from the circuit, land, and district courts.  
The legislation deleted the reference to land and district 
courts and provided that “[a]ny pa rty deeming himself aggrieved 
by the judgment of a  circuit court in a criminal matter, may 
appeal . . . within the time provided by the Hawaii Rules of 
Criminal Procedure.  The sentence of the court in a criminal 
case shall be the judgment.”  1972 Haw.  Sess. Laws Act 89, § 5 
at 348 (emphasis added).  To define the right of appeal of 
district court defendants, Act 89 relocated the prior provision 
permitting appeals of “all decisions” of “district magistrates” 
in both civil and criminal cases and expressl
y limited its 
applicability to criminal cases.  Id.  Thus, as a result of the 
1972 legislation, (1) any circuit court defendant “deeming 
himself aggrieved by the judgment . . . in a criminal matter” 
could seek an appeal, and “[t]he sentence of the court in  a 
criminal case” constituted “the judgment,” see HRS § 641- 11 
(1972), and (2) district court defendants could appeal from “all 
final decisions and final judgments  . . . in all criminal 
matters,” see HRS § 641- 12 (1972).   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
24   Any  textual difference created by Act 89 between the 
statutory rights of circuit court defendants and district court 
defendants does not appear to be purposeful.  Rather than 
substantively modifying the appellate rights of defendants, the 
stated purpose of Act 89 was to “eliminate incon sistencies with 
the rules of court;  delete outmoded provisions;  make 
improvements of a technical nature;  and transfer procedural 
matters to rules of court where advisable.”  S. Stand. Comm. 
Rep. No. 622-72, in 1972 Senate Journal, at 1005.  A Senate 
Special Committee Report on the amendments made to the new 
“Appeals” chapter was silent regarding the difference in 
statutory text between HRS § 641- 11 and HRS § 641 -12, and it 
neither explained nor referenced the treatment afforded to 
circuit court versus district court defendants pursuant to the 
legislation.  See 
id. at 1006 (stating that Senate Special 
Committee Report No. 7 on Act 89 “reflect[ed] the views of” the 
Senate Committee on Judiciary); see also  S. Spec. Comm. Rep. No. 
7, in 1972 Senate Journal, at 705 (discussing the “Appeals” 
chapter created by Act 89).  Likewise, the report on Act 89 
created by the Committee on Coordination of Rules and Statutes 
manifests no intent to create different appellate rights for 
district and circuit court criminal defendants, but, rather, to 
more clearly organize and set forth the appellate rights of ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
25 civil and criminal litigants in general.  See S. Stand. Comm. 
Rep. No. 622-72, in 1972 Senate Journal, at 1006 (finding The 
Report of the Committee on Coordination of Rules and Statutes to 
be helpful, though not necessarily 
reflecting the views of the 
Senate Committee on Judiciary); see also  Comm. on Coordination 
of Rules and Statutes, 2 Report of the Committee on Coordination 
of Rules and Statutes  § 641 (Sept. 1, 1971) (explaining proposed 
amendments relating to appeals).   
  The statutory scheme created by Act 89 remains in 
effect today, and the appellate rights codified at HRS § 641- 11 
and HRS § 641-12 that are relevant to this case remain 
substantively identical to those enacted by Act 89.
  Relying on 
the language specific to HRS § 641- 12, courts of this 
jurisdiction have interpreted the statute to grant district 
court defendants the right to appeal orders of dismissal without 
prejudice.  See, e.g. , State v. Hern, 133 Hawai i 59, 62, 323 
P.3d 1241, 1244 (App. 2013) (adjudicating on remand defendant’s 
appeal of an order of dismissal without prejudice after this 
court vacated the ICA’s  order dismissing on jurisdictional 
grounds).  Thus, under the Hawaii Revised Statutes, district 
court defendants and the State in either district or circuit 
court may appeal from an order dismissing proceedings
 without 
prejudice.  Id.; Kalani , 87 Hawai i at 261, 953 P.2d at 1359.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
C. 
26 Nicol May Appeal the Circuit Court’s Order of Dismissal 
Under HRS § 641- 11 
 
 This court has not previously articulated a clear 
ruling as to whether circuit court defendants in criminal 
matters are afforded the right to appeal an order dismissing 
proceedings without prejudice under HRS § 641-11.  The text of 
the statute provides that any party “aggrieved by the judgment” 
of the circuit court in a criminal case may take an  appeal.  HRS 
§ 641-11.  Significantly, as noted,  the clause specifying that 
“[t]he sentence of the court in a criminal case shall be the 
judgment” was not intended to narrow the scope of orders and 
decisions from which circuit court defendants could appeal.  S. 
Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 181, in 1925 Senate J ournal, at 550- 51.  
Rather, it was intended to ensure that defendants timely 
appealed and to erase ambiguity as to the deadline by which 
defendants were required to do so.  
Id. 
  In keeping with the identification of the “sentence” 
as the “judgment” as relating to issues of  timing rather than 
scope, appellate courts of this jurisdiction have not 
interpreted HRS § 641- 11 solely by considering whether or not 
the relevant decision contained an order of punishment or other 
formal pronouncement of guilt.  Rather, as discussed, in  
determining whether dispositions are subject to appeal under the 
statute, our courts have focused the inquiry on whether the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
27 relevant order terminated the proceedings in the case and left 
nothing further to be accomplished by the lower court.  See, 
e.g., State v. Johnston , 63 Haw. 9, 10, 619 P.2d 1076, 1077 
(1980); 
Ui, 66 Haw. at 368- 69, 663 P.2d at  631-32; State v. 
Ferreira, 54 Haw. 485, 486-87, 510 P.2d 88, 89 (1973) ; State v. 
Lawrence, 139 Hawai i 192, 200, 386 P.3d 476, 484  (App. 2016); 
Kealaiki, 95 Hawai i at 312, 22 P.3d at  591.   
  We also consider that, under the ICA’s interpretation 
of the statute in this case, district court defendants may 
appeal an order of dismissal without prejudice pursuant to HRS § 
641-12 while circuit court defendants are denied the same right 
under HRS § 641-11.  In light of the history of these 
provisions, this court cannot conclude that the legislature 
intended to grant one right to district court defendants yet 
withhold that right fro
m circuit court defendants.  Rather, it 
appears that the legislature intended to maintain a preexisting 
appellate scheme that granted  to criminal defendants in general 
the right to appeal final orders.   The difference in text 
between the two statutes likel y resulted from the concerted 
effort to reorganize the appellate statutory scheme and delete 
obsolete provisions, rather than to create different classes of 
rights to be afforded to circuit court and district court 
defendants with regard to final orders and judgments.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
  Additionally, there are several situations  in which 
the district and circuit courts may have jurisdiction  over the 
same criminal charge.  Under HRS § 603 –21.5(a)(1) (Supp. 2008), 
the circuit courts have jurisdiction over all “[c]riminal  
offenses cognizable under the laws  of the State, committed 
within their respective circuits.”   Under HRS § 604 –8(a) (Supp. 
2001), the criminal jurisdiction of the district courts is 
limited to “ criminal offenses punishable by fine, or by 
imprisonment not exceeding one year whether with or without 
fine.”  However, misdemeanor or petty offenses may be brought in 
circuit court if,  for example, they are related  to a felony 
offense as prescribed by the Hawaii Revised Statutes.  
See State 
v. Aiu
, 59 Haw. 92, 97 n.8, 576 P.2d 1044, 1048 n.8 (1978) 
(observing in a case involving  both felony and misdemeanor 
charges arising from the same course of conduct that “ both the 
misdemeanor and felony charges in this case could have been 
joined and tried in circuit co urt”).  Jurisdiction over a  charge 
may also transfer from the district court to the circuit court 
if a district court defendant exercises a right to a trial by 
jury.  See HRPP Rule 5(b)(3) (20 14) (describing the procedures 
by which district court defendants who do not waive their right 
to a jury trial “shall [be] commit[ted] . . . to the circuit 
court for trial by jury”).   If in either of these circumstances 
28 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
29 charges are subsequently dismissed without prejudice, it would 
appear unreasonable to base a def endant’s right of appeal on 
whether a misdemeanor charge had been joined with a felony 
accusation or whether the defendant had requested a jury trial  
10 on a misdemeanor charge
.
  Further, the ICA’s interpretation of HRS § 641 -11 
would result in broader appellate rights being afforded to those 
faced with less serious crimes and the denial of such rights to 
those faced with charges of a greater gravity.  Permitting those 
faced with misdemeanor and petty charges to appeal an order of 
dismissal without prejudice while denying that same right to 
circuit court defendants does not take into account that those 
faced with more serious charges may have an equal or  greater 
interest in appealing an order of dismissal without prejudice so 
as to preclude reprosecution.  Interests relating to judicial 
economy and practicality
 likewise suggest that in such 
circumstances, it would be inconsistent to permit an immediate 
appeal from an order of dismissal without prejudice 
from the 
                                                           
 10 We further observe that under such an interpretation of HRS § 
641-11, a district court defendant who wishes to exercise  a constitutional 
right to a trial by jury--thereby resulting in the commitment of the case to 
circuit court--would be effectively deprived  of the right to appeal an order 
of dismissal without prejudice.  A district court defendant in such a 
situation may therefore be burdened in the exercise of the jury trial right 
insofar as the invocation of the constitutional right deprives the defendant 
of the statutory right  to appeal.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
30 district court yet to preclude an appeal from the same order 
issued by the circuit court when the underlying charge may be 
identical. 
 See Keliipuleole v. Wilson , 85 Hawaii 217, 221- 22, 
941 P.2d 300, 304- 05 (1997) (“[a] rational, sensible and 
practicable interpretation [of a statute] is preferred to one 
which is unreasonable or impracticable” (alterations in 
original) (quoting State v. Lobendahn , 71 Haw. 111, 112, 784 
P.2d 872, 873 (1989))).  
  Relatedly , contrary to the State’s contention, it is 
not readily apparent that circuit court defendants ha ve the 
right to seek an interlocutory appeal of an order of dismissal 
without prejudice pursuant to HRS § 641-17 (Supp. 2004).  HRS § 
641-17 provides in relevant part that “[u]pon application . . . 
an appeal in a criminal matter may be allowed to a defendant 
from the circuit court . . . from a decision denying a motion to 
dismiss or from other interlocutory orders .”  HRS § 641- 17 
(emphasis added).  The circuit court’s determination whether to 
grant an interlocutory appeal under the statute is subject to 
whether the judge, “in the judge’s discretion,”  believes that 
such an appeal would be “advisable for a more speedy termination 
of the case.”  Id.  (emphas is added).   
  Thus, HRS § 641- 17 clearly affords circuit court 
defendants the right to seek an interlocutory appeal of a denial ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
31 of a motion to dismiss.  Id.  However, it is not clear that the 
same statutory right attaches to the grant of a motion to 
dismiss.  Indeed, the text of the statute suggests that such an 
order would not be subject to HRS § 641-17; review of an order 
of dismissal is not necessarily “advisable” to facilitate “a 
more speedy termination of the case” in such circums tances 
because, by virtue of the order, proceedings have already 
terminated.  Id.; see also Kalani , 87 Hawai i at 261-62, 953 P.2d 
at 1359-60 (describing legal effect of order dismissing 
proceedings without prejudice).  For this reason, the State’s 
characterization of an order of dismissal without prejudice--
which represents a final termination of the case-- as an 
interlocutory order subject to discretionary appeal within the 
meaning of the statute may likewise be incorrect .  See 
Interlocutory, Black ’s Law Dictionary  (10th ed. 2014) (defining 
“interlocutory” as “interim or temporary; not constituting a 
final resolution of the whole controversy”).   
  As we described in Kalani, 87 Hawai i at 261- 62, 953 
P.2d at 1359-60, an order of dismissal without prejudice leaves 
“nothing further to be accomplished in the trial court.”  The 
proceedings are ended, and, therefore, “an order grantin
g a 
motion to dismiss is final.”  Id.  Thus, in light of the  focus 
of our caselaw on general considerations of finality in ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
32 interpreting HRS § 641-11, the legislative intent behind the key 
language in the statute, the history of HRS § 641-11 as it 
relates to parallel statutes setting forth the rights of appeal 
of the State and district court defendants, and the  principle 
that HRS § 641-11 is to be construed in pari materia with other 
provisions authorizing appeals in criminal matters,  we conclude 
that a circuit court defendant may appeal an order dismissing 
11 proceedings without prejudice under HRS § 641
-11.   
V.
 CONCLUSION 
  We conclude that HRS § 641- 11 authorizes a defendant’s 
appeal in a criminal matter from a circuit court order 
12dismissing the proceedings without prejudice.
  The ICA’s Order 
Dismissing the Appeal 
was based on the ICA’s  conclusion that it 
                                                           
 11 We also observe that affording a right of appeal of an order of 
dismissal without prejudice to district court defendants but denying that 
right to circuit court defendants would yield anomalous results.  See 
Lawrence, 139 Hawai i at 201, 386 P.3d at 485 (finding jurisdiction under HRS 
§ 641-11 over a judgment of acquittal and order of commitment in part because 
“to construe [the statute] to preclude an appeal under the circumstances of 
[the] case” would be “anomalous” (citing State v. Burgo, 71 Haw. 198, 202, 
787 P.2d 221, 223 (1990) )).  That is, it is rational, sensible , and 
practicable to interpret HRS § 641 -11 to afford defendants the right to 
appeal from an order of dismissal without prejudice issued by the circuit 
court.  See Keliipuleole, 85 Hawai i at 221 -22, 941 P.2d at 304- 05 (“[a] 
rational, sensible and practicable interpretation [of a statute] is preferred 
to one which is unreasonable or impracticable” (alterations in original) 
(quoting Lobendahn, 71 Haw. at 112, 784 P.2d at 873)).  
 12 To the extent that the ICA’s prior decisions in State v. Kim, 109 
Hawaii 59, 60, 122 P.3d 1157, 1158 (App. 2005), and State v. Hern, 133 Hawai i 
59, 62 n.5, 323 P.3 d 1241, 1244 n.5 (App. 2013), suggest that a circuit court 
defendant may not appeal an order of dismissal without prejudice, they are 
therefore incorrect.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
lacked jurisdiction under HRS § 641 -11 to review  Nicol’s appeal 
13of the circuit court’s Order of Dismissal.   Accordingly, 
the 
ICA’s January 11, 2017 Order Dismissing the Appeal is vacated, 
and the case is remanded to the ICA for proceedings consistent 
33 with this opinion.

 13 In light of our conclusion with respect to jurisdiction based on 
HRS § 641- 11, it is not necessary  to determine whether jurisdiction exists 
pursuant to this court’s supervisory authority set forth in HRS § 602 -4 
(1993) or under the collateral order doctrine; for the same reason, we also 
do not reach the constitutional issues raised by Nicol on appeal .
