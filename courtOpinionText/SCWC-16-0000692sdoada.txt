STATE OF HAWAI# I,
Respondent/Plaintiff-Appellee, 
vs. 
SHUAN E. FLEETWOOD, also known as SHAUN FLEETWOOD,
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant. 
CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
(CAAP-16-0000692; 1PC101001668) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.) 
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant Shuan E. Fleetwood, also 
known as Shaun Fleetwood (Fleetwood) appeals the Intermediate 
Court of Appeals’ (ICA) November 7, 2018 Judgment on Appeal affirming the Circuit Court of the First Circuit’s (circuit court) order of resentencing and revocation of probation. 
On January 18, 2011, Fleetwood pled guilty to two 
counts of sexual assault in the second degree. The circuit court sentenced Fleetwood to five years of Hawaii’s Opportunity Probation with Enforcement (HOPE probation) for each count, to    *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
run concurrently. As a condition of probation, the circuit court 
sentenced Fleetwood to one year in prison. 
Fleetwood met with his probation officer after he was 
released from prison, then left the state of Hawai# i to visit his 
ill father in Louisiana. 
In Louisiana, Fleetwood was arrested 
for an outstanding warrant from a previous sexual assault in 
Arkansas. 
Respondent/Plaintiff-Appellee the State of Hawai# i (the 
State) filed a Motion for Modification of the Terms and Conditions of Probation and/or Motion for Revocation of Probation (motion for revocation of probation) after Fleetwood failed to report to his probation officer in November 2011. 
The circuit 
court issued a bench warrant for Fleetwood’s arrest. 
In 2016, Fleetwood’s prison term for the Arkansas 
sexual assault ended and he was extradited to Hawai# i. The 
circuit court1 held a hearing on the State’s 2011 motion for 
revocation of probation, where Fleetwood’s original probation officer testified that, in 2011, he explained the terms and conditions of Fleetwood’s probation to him, and that he did not give Fleetwood permission to leave the state. Fleetwood testified that no one explained the terms and conditions of his probation to him and that his probation officer told him he could

2  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
leave Hawai# i to visit his father. 
The circuit court found that Fleetwood inexcusably 
violated a substantial condition of his probation by failing to 
report to his probation officer in 2011. 
At the resentencing hearing, Fleetwood testified “I 
should have known the law a little bit better. 
The only thing I 
wish I would have done was known the law a little bit better and known about the Interstate Compact,[ ] sir, which I did not 
know.” Citing Fleetwood’s prior convictions and the fact that Fleetwood maintained, in direct contradiction with his probation officer’s testimony, that his probation officer failed to explain the terms and conditions of his probation and gave him permission to leave the state, the circuit court resentenced Fleetwood to ten years’ imprisonment. 
The circuit court stated: 2
I find that Mr. Fleetwood is not a good
candidate for probation. The fact that he took the 
stand and clearly denied everything in contradiction
of what [Fleetwood’s probation officer] had stated tohim, which I find that – part of probation is you needto be honest, Mr. Fleetwood. And the fact that youcouldn’t take the stand and tell this Court that youdid know the terms and conditions and that you weretold by your probation officer that you could leave.
So it will be the judgment of this Court that in
Count 1, 10-1-1668, 1 and 2, you will serve a periodof ten years. 
(Emphasis added). 
2 Fleetwood’s probation officer testified that “there’s an
interstate compact that has to go through in order for us to have a clienttransfer to another state for supervision.” This statement indicates that a probation officer is not, on the probation officer’s own authority, able topermit a probationer to leave the state. 
3 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The ICA affirmed the circuit court’s order of 
resentencing and revocation of probation. 
We vacate the order of resentencing and revocation of 
probation. The circuit court abused its discretion in using 
Fleetwood’s maintenance that he did not inexcusably violate the terms of his probation as a basis for imposing a harsher sentence, in contravention of the rule adopted by this court in State v. Kamana# o, 103 Hawai# i 315, 82 P.3d 401 (2003). 
This court held in Kamana# o that “a sentencing court 
may not impose an enhanced sentence based on a defendant’s refusal to admit guilt with respect to an offense the conviction of which he intends to appeal.” Kamana
#o, 103 Hawai# i at 316, 82 
P.3d at 402. In Kamana# o, a jury convicted Kamana# o of multiple 
counts of sexual assault. Id. Kamana# o maintained his innocence 
throughout trial and post-conviction. Id. at 323, 82 P.3d at 409. At a hearing on extended sentencing, the prosecutor argued that certain aggravating factors, including Kamana# o’s lack of 
remorse and refusal to admit guilt, justified imposing an extended sentence. Id. at 317, 82 P.3d at 403. The circuit court granted the State’s motion, stating, inter alia, 
In addition to the nature and multiplicity of the
offenses committed by [Kamana #o], the seriousness, the
flagrancy of his conduct is aggravated by what hasbeen pointed out by [the DPA]: That he refuses toacknowledge his culpability for these offenses . . . .his refusal to acknowledge this very seriousbehavioral problem, which caused him to terrorize andvictimize and assault his victims, negates any 
4 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
  reasonable expectation of his rehabilitation, whether
in 20 years or for the duration of his life
. 
Id. at 318, 82 P.3d at 404 (emphases in original). This court 
vacated Kamana# o’s sentence and remanded for resentencing, 
holding that “the circuit court violated Kamanao’s constitutional privilege against self-incrimination by imposing an enhanced sentence . . . based solely on Kamanao’s refusal to admit his guilt with respect to the offenses of which he was convicted by a jury.” Id. at 320, 82 P.3d at 406. This court then adopted the 
following three-part test, set forth by the Michigan Supreme Court in People v. Wesley, 411 N.W.2d 159 (1987), for assessing whether a sentencing court erroneously relied on a defendant’s refusal to admit guilt in imposing a sentence: 
(1) the defendant’s maintenance of innocence after the
conviction, (2) the judge’s attempt to get thedefendant to admit guilt, and (3) the appearancethat[,] had the defendant affirmatively admittedguilt, his sentence would not have been so severe . .. . [I]f there is an indication of the three factors,then the sentence was likely to have been improperlyinfluenced by the defendant’s persistence in hisinnocence. If, however, the record shows that thecourt did no more than address the factor of remorsefulness as it bore upon defendant’srehabilitation, then the court’s reference to adefendant’s persistent claims of innocence will not
amount to error requiring reversal. 
Id. at 323, 82 P.3d at 409 (citing Wesley, 411 N.W.2d at 162). 
Applying those factors, this court held that “Kamanao’s refusal to admit guilt ‘improperly influenced’ the circuit court’s decision to grant the prosecution’s motion for an extended term of imprisonment.” Id. 
5 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
As an initial matter, though this court has only 
applied the Kamana# o test in the context of initial sentencing, 
we hold that the rule applies with equal force at resentencing 
because the constitutional issues which gave rise to the 
Kamana# o 
analysis also arise at resentencing. First, the privilege against self-incrimination, which exists at initial sentencing, also exists during a probation revocation hearing and resentencing. State v. Villiarimo, 132 Hawai# i 209, 219, 320 
P.3d 874, 884 (2014) (“[A] revocation proceeding is akin to the initial sentencing hearing.”). Second, a defendant is able to appeal resentencing or the revocation of probation just as a defendant may appeal initial sentencing. The Kamana# o court 
sought to protect defendants who refuse to admit guilt, knowing that they intend to appeal their conviction. 103 Hawai# i at 316, 
82 P.3d at 402 (“[A] sentencing court may not impose an enhanced sentence based on a defendant’s refusal to admit guilt with respect to an offense the conviction of which he intends to appeal.”) (emphasis added). For the purposes of the Kamana# o 
analysis, the revocation of probation is equivalent to a conviction for a charged offense. The Kamana# o rule therefore 
applies whenever a judge issues a sentence, irrespective of when in the course of the proceedings the sentence is issued. 
The application of the Kamana# o factors indicates that, 
in sentencing Fleetwood to ten years’ imprisonment, the circuit 
6 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
court improperly relied on Fleetwood’s maintenance that he did 
not violate his probation. 
There is an “indication of” the first factor because 
Fleetwood maintained his innocence after conviction. At the circuit court’s hearing on the State’s motion for revocation of probation, the “conviction” occurred when the circuit court found that Fleetwood had inexcusably violated a substantial condition of his probation. Therefore, any statement made “after conviction” pursuant to the Kamana# o analysis occurred after the 
circuit court made this finding. Before Fleetwood was “convicted,” Fleetwood testified that he did not inexcusably violate his probation because his probation officer gave him permission to leave the state and because he did not understand the terms and conditions of his probation. After “conviction,” but before the imposition of sentence, Fleetwood testified, “I should have known the law a little bit better. The only thing I wish I would have done was known the law a little bit better and known about the Interstate Compact, sir, which I did not know.” Fleetwood thus maintained that his probation officer gave him permission to leave Hawai# i, by testifying that he should have 
known that his probation officer lacked authority to give him such permission without complying with the Interstate Compact. By so testifying, Fleetwood maintains that he did not inexcusably 
7 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
violate the terms of his probation, which is equivalent to 
maintaining his innocence. 
There is no indication of the second factor, that the 
court attempted to get the defendant to admit guilt, but case law indicates that absence of the second factor is not fatal to the Kamana# o analysis. See, e.g., State v. Barrios, 139 Hawai# i
  321, 
338, 389 P.3d 916, 933 (2016) (holding that the circuit court improperly inferred that the defendant lacked remorse, despite no 
indication of the second Kamana# o factor); State v. Bailey, No. 
CAAP-14-0000386, 2015 WL 405742 at *3-4 (App. Jan. 30, 2015) 
(SDO) (holding that the circuit court was improperly influenced by the defendant’s maintenance of his innocence, despite no indication of the second Kamana# o factor). Because the first and 
third factors are present here, the absence of the second factor is insufficient to indicate that the circuit court was not improperly influenced by Fleetwood’s maintenance of innocence. 
There is an indication of the third factor because it 
appears that the circuit court gave Fleetwood a harsher sentence because he maintained that he did not inexcusably violate his probation. Although the circuit court listed several bases for sentencing Fleetwood to ten years’ imprisonment, it appears that the circuit court would have imposed a less severe sentence had Fleetwood admitted his guilt. 
The circuit court first observed 
8  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
that Fleetwood had several prior convictions. However, the 
circuit court seemed to focus on Fleetwood’s refusal to admit that he had inexcusably violated the terms of his probation. The circuit court stated, 
I find that Mr. Fleetwood is not a good
candidate for probation. The fact that he took the 
stand and clearly denied everything in contradiction
of what [Fleetwood’s probation officer] had stated tohim, which I find that – part of probation is you needto be honest, Mr. Fleetwood. And the fact that youcouldn’t take the stand and tell this Court that youdid know the terms and conditions and that you weretold by your probation officer that you could leave.
So it will be the judgment of this Court that in
Count 1, 10-1-1668, 1 and 2, you will serve a periodof ten years. 
(Emphasis added). 
The circuit court explicitly cited Fleetwood’s 
invocation of his right to maintain his innocence as a basis for 
sentencing Fleetwood to prison time as opposed to probation. The circuit court implied that, if Fleetwood had conceded that he inexcusably violated his probation by admitting that his probation officer did not give him permission to leave the state and did explain the terms and conditions of his probation, he would have been a good candidate for probation. HOPE probation would have been a significantly lighter sentence than ten years’ incarceration.  Therefore, there is an indication of the third

resentencing to a term of imprisonment. Modifications of probation that are
accompanied by brief terms of confinement, which are a hallmark of HOPE,involve different considerations and are not affected by this decision.

factor. 
Because there is a strong indication of factors one and 
three, the circuit court was likely improperly influenced by 
Fleetwood’s maintenance of innocence. 
Pursuant to Kamana# o, this 
improper influence violated Fleetwood’s privilege against self-incrimination. Therefore, the circuit court abused its discretion in sentencing Fleetwood to a ten-year term of imprisonment. 
As such, the ICA gravely erred in affirming the circuit 
court’s order of resentencing and revocation of probation. 
We therefore vacate the ICA’s November 7, 2018 judgment 
on appeal to the extent that it affirmed the circuit court’s order of resentencing and revocation of probation. 
We remand to 
the circuit court for resentencing.
