 OPINION OF THE COURT BY RECKTENWALD, C.J. 
 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
 In 2016, police arrested Troy Hosaka for Habitually 
Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of Intoxicants (Habitual 
OVUII).  After his arrest, a Honolulu Police Department (HPD) 
officer read Hosaka the Department’s implied consent form (HPD-
396K) advising him of his right to refuse testing and explaining 
that Hosaka “may [] be subject to the procedures and sanctions 
under [Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes (HRS)] chapter 291E,” if he 
refused.  Hosaka signed and initialed the form, electing to take 
a breath test.  Now, Hosaka seeks to suppress the breath test 
results, arguing that his consent was not knowing, intelligent and voluntary because the form did not comply with the implied 
consent statutory scheme governed by HRS Chapter 291E and is 
inaccurate as a result.  We disagree. 
We conclude that HPD’s implied consent form complied 
with HRS Chapter 291E and was accurate.  Moreover, even if the 
form had been inaccurate, non-compliance with the implied 
consent statutory scheme does not automatically mandate suppression — suppression is only warranted where an arrestee 
did not validly consent to chemical testing.  While an 
inaccuracy in an implied consent form is a relevant factor to 
consider, whether consent is knowing, intelligent and voluntary 
must be determined by looking to the totality of the  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
3 
 circumstances.  Consent 
 can be invalid if the inaccurate 
information conveyed is reasonably likely to influence an 
arrestee’s consent, in which case the consent is not knowing or 
intelligent; or it can be invalid because it was coerced, in 
which case the consent is not voluntary.  In both situations, 
the question is whether the consent was valid, not whether the 
form complied with every technical requirement in the implied 
consent statutory scheme.  Here, because the totality of the 
circumstances show that Hosaka validly consented to a breath test, the breath test results are admissible. 
II.  BACKGROUND 
 By driving on a public road in the State of Hawaiʻ i, 
drivers are deemed to have consented to a blood, breath, or urine test (“chemical test”) to determine the level of 
intoxicants in their system if they are suspected of driving 
under the influence.  HRS § 291E-11(a) (2007).  When requesting 
a driver take a chemical test, a law enforcement officer must 
inform the driver that they have the right to refuse testing.  
HRS § 291E-11(b)(2).  If the driver chooses to refuse, they must 
be informed of the administrative sanctions that could be imposed as a result — namely, suspension of their license and 
privilege to drive — and given an opportunity to reconsider 
their decision.  HRS § 291E-15 (Supp. 2016).  If, after that 
second advisement, the driver persists in refusing, their

 driver’s license may be suspended after a hearing.  HRS § 291E-
41 (Supp. 2012). 
A. 
Factual Background 
 In January 2016, police pulled over and arrested 
Hosaka for Habitual OVUII.  Hosaka has not contested that police 
had probable cause to arrest him on suspicion of driving under 
the influence of intoxicants.   
While Hosaka was in custody, HPD Officer Jared Spiker 
read Hosaka, verbatim, HPD’s implied consent form (HPD-396K) entitled “USE OF INTOXICANTS WHILE OPERATING A VEHICLE — IMPLIED 
CONSENT FOR TESTING” (“implied consent form” or “form”).  The 
form stated in relevant part: 
USE OF INTOXICANTS WHILE OPERATING A VEHICLE 
IMPLIED CONSENT FOR TESTING[2] 
 
DATE OF ARREST:  1-11-16   REPORT NO.: 16- 015999  
 
ARRESTEE’S[] NAME: Troy Hosaka      
 
I,  Jared Spiker  , a police officer, swear that the 
following statements were read to the arrestee[].  
Pursuant to chapter 291E, Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes 
(HRS), Use of Intoxicants While Operating a Vehicle, 
you are being informed of the following: 
 
1. TH  Any person who operates a vehicle upon a 
public way, street, road, or highway or on or in the 
waters of the State shall be deemed to have given consent to a test or tests for the purpose of 
determining alcohol concentration or drug content of 
the person[’]s breath, blood, or urine as applicable.
 
 2.
 TH  You are not entitled to an attorney before you 
submit to any test[] or tests to determine your 
alcohol and/or drug content.  
 3.
 TH  You may refuse to submit to a breath or blood 
                     
2 Italicized text indicates where the form was filled out by hand.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
5 test, or both for the purpose of determining alcohol 
concentration and/or blood or urine test, or both for 
the purpose of determining drug content.  If you do 
refuse, then none shall be given, except as provided 
in section 291E- 21.[]  However, if you refuse to 
submit to a breath, blood, or urine test, you may be 
subject to up to the sanctions of 291E- 65[] if you 
are under 21 years of age at the time of the offense.  43
In addition, you may also be subject to the 
procedures and sanctions under chapter 291E, part 
III. 
ALCOHOL CONCENTRATION
 
TH AGREED TO TAKE A BREATH TEST AND REFUSED THE 
BLOOD TEST  
. . . . 
I, THE ARRESTEE/RESPONDENT, ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I MADE 
THE CHOICE(S) INDICATED ABOVE AND WAS INFORMED OF THE 
INFORMATION IN THIS REPORT. 
ARRESTEE’S[] SIGNATURE: Troy Hosaka [Date]: 1-12-16 
SIGNED:  Jared Spiker  [ID]: 103267 [Date]: 1-12-16 
(Emphasis added.)  
Hosaka initialed each of the form’s three advisement 
paragraphs, initialed that he “agreed to take a breath test and 
refused the blood test,” and signed the form at the bottom to 
“acknowledge that [he] made the choice[] indicated above and was 
informed of the information in [the form].”  After completing the form, Hosaka took the breath test, which showed that his 
blood alcohol content was .134 percent — well over the legal 
3HRS § 291E- 21(a) (2007) permits a law enforcement officer to 
obtain a breath, blood, or urine sample from any driver involved in a 
collision causing injury or death to any person. 
4HRS § 291E-65 (Supp. 2016) governs administrative sanctions for a 
refusal by a person under twenty- one arrested under HRS § 291E- 64 (2007) 
(operating a vehicle after consuming a measurable amount of alcohol).  
Sanctioning under this section would not apply to Hosaka, since Hosaka was 
forty-two at the time of his arrest.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
6 limit.  The State of Hawaiʻi charged Hosaka with Habitual OVUII, 
in violation of HRS § 291E-61.5 (2007 & Supp. 2015),  in the 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court).   65
B. Circuit Court’s Suppression of Hosaka’s Breath Test Results
Before trial, Hosaka filed a motion to suppress his 
breath test results, arguing that the test constituted an 
unreasonable search in violation of the United States and 
Hawaiʻi Constitutions.  He argued that his purported consent was 
coerced, and thus invalid, because the implied consent form 
advised him, “if you refuse to submit to a breath, blood, or 
urine test . . . you may [] be subject to the procedures and 
sanctions under chapter 291E, part III.”  According to Hosaka, 
by informing him that he may be subject to sanctions if he were 
to refuse testing, the form failed to adequately inform him of 
his right to withdraw his consent and did not follow statutorily 
required procedures.  Thus, the breath test violated his fourth 
5HRS § 291E- 61.5 provides in relevant part: 
(a)A person commits the offense of habitually
operating a vehicle under the influence of an
intoxicant if:
(1)The person is a habitual operator of a
vehicle while under the influence of anintoxicant; and
(2)The person operates or assumes actualphysical control of a vehicle:
. . . . 
(C)With .08 or more grams of alcoholper two hundred ten liters of
breath[.]

***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and 
seizures, and the results of the test needed to be suppressed.   
The circuit court agreed with Hosaka, concluding that 
HRS §§ 291E-11 and 291E-15, when read in pari materia, required 
“an arrested person [] first [be] given a completely 
unencumbered choice to refuse to submit” to testing.  
Accordingly, police could not inform Hosaka that any sanctions 
could result from a refusal until after he made the initial choice to refuse.  Because the implied consent form advised 
Hosaka that sanctions “may” result, the circuit court found that 
his consent was coerced and suppressed the breath test results.   
C. ICA Proceedings  The State appealed the suppression of Hosaka’s breath 
test results to the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA), arguing that the form complied with HRS Chapter 291E and that the 
chapter did not require an OVUII arrestee to have an 
“unencumbered choice” to refuse a chemical test.    The ICA agreed with the State that suppression was not 
warranted, vacating the circuit court’s order and remanding the case for further proceedings.  However, the ICA agreed with the 
circuit court that HPD’s implied consent form did not comply 
with HRS Chapter 291E’s mandated procedures because the chapter 
required that an OVUII arrestee have an initial opportunity to 
refuse to submit to testing prior to being informed of possible  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
8 
 sanctions.  
 
 Nevertheless, the ICA concluded that suppression of 
Hosaka’s breath test was not the proper remedy for non-
compliance with HRS Chapter 291E procedures because HRS § 291E-
15 barred the imposition of sanctions only where the arrestee 
was never informed of potential sanctions at any point during 
the advisal.  Here, because the form informed Hosaka of the 
possible sanctions for refusing and Hosaka was given the opportunity to refuse testing with those sanctions in mind, the 
ICA concluded that the form’s statement that Hosaka “may” have 
been subject to sanctions was accurate and therefore that the 
results need not be suppressed.  Further, the ICA held that that 
the circuit court “erred in concluding that burdening an 
arrestee’s election to refuse to submit to testing with any 
significant sanctions renders the arrestee’s consent invalid.”   
 Hosaka timely filed an application for writ of 
certiorari.   
III.  STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Statutory Interpretation 
 The interpretation of a statute is a question of law 
that this court reviews de novo.  State v. Arceo, 84 Hawaiʻ i 1, 
10, 928 P.2d 843, 852 (1996). 
When construing a statute, our foremost obligation is 
to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the 
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the language contained in the statute itself.  And we  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
9 
 must read statutory language in the context of the 
entire statute and construe it in a manner consistent 
with its purpose. 
 
State v. Ruggiero, 114 Hawaiʻ i 227, 231, 160 P.3d 703, 707 (2007) 
(quoting Gray v. Admin. Dir. of the Court, 84 Hawaiʻ i 138, 144, 
931 P.2d 580, 586 (1997)). 
B. Motion to Suppress 
 We review a circuit court’s findings of fact on a 
motion to suppress under the clearly erroneous standard.  State 
v. Alvarez, 138 Hawaiʻ i 173, 181, 378 P.3d 889, 897 (2016).  
However, we review the court’s conclusions of law de novo: “The 
question of whether the facts as found amount to legally 
adequate ‘consent’ is a question of constitutional law that a 
court answers by exercising its ‘own independent constitutional 
judgment based on the facts of the case.’”  State v. Won, 137 
Hawaiʻi 330, 341, 372 P.3d 1065, 1076 (2015) (quoting State v. 
Trainor, 83 Hawaiʻ i 250, 255, 925 P.2d 818, 823 (1996)). 
IV.  DISCUSSION 
 The fourth amendment to the United States Constitution 
and its counterpart, article I, section 7 of the Hawaiʻ i  
Constitution, guarantee the right of persons to be free from 
unreasonable searches.  An intoxilyzer test is a search under 
these provisions; however, consent is a well-established 
exception to the requirement that a warrant be obtained before a 
search takes place.  Won, 137 Hawai
ʻi at 340, 372 P.3d at 1075.   
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
10 
 As discussed above, the State contends that Hosaka consented to 
a breath test when advised of his rights under the implied 
consent statute. 
 “This court has stated unambiguously that for consent 
to be ‘in fact, freely and voluntarily given,’ the consent ‘must 
be uncoerced,’” a determination that requires looking to the 
totality of the circumstances.  Id. at 341, 372 P.3d at 1076 
(quoting Nakamoto v. Fasi, 64 Haw. 17, 21, 635 P.2d 946, 951 
(1981)). 
 Thus, to decide whether to suppress the results of a 
chemical test administered on the basis of an arrestee’s consent, the court must evaluate the circumstances under which 
consent was given.  While the accuracy of the implied consent 
form and its compliance with HRS Chapter 291E are relevant 
considerations, the central inquiry is not simply whether the 
form complies with the relevant statutes, but whether the 
circumstances indicate the arrestee’s consent was knowing, 
intelligent, and voluntary.  See Won, 137 Hawaiʻ i at 345, 372 
P.3d at 1080 (“[I]n order to legitimize submission to a 
warrantless BAC test under the consent exception, . . . it must 
be concluded that, under the totality of the circumstances, 
consent was in fact freely and voluntarily given.”). 
A. The Implied Consent Form Complied with HRS Chapter 291E  
 
 Hosaka argues that his consent was coerced because of  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
11 
 defects in HPD’s implied consent form.  Accordingly, we first 
consider whether the form was accurate and in compliance with 
the implied consent statutory scheme (HRS Chapter 291E).  We 
conclude that it was. 
 
1. HRS Chapter 291E establishes a two-step procedure for 
advising OVUII arrestees of their right to refuse 
chemical testing 
 
 First, we agree with the circuit court and the ICA 
that HRS Chapter 291E’s provisions, when read in pari materia, 
establish a two-step procedure for advising arrestees of their 
right to refuse chemical testing.  See State v. Kamana‘ o, 118 
Hawaiʻi 210, 218, 188 P.3d 724, 732 (2008) (“[L]aws in pari 
materia, or upon the same subject matter, shall be construed 
with reference to each other.  What is clear in one statute may 
be called upon in aid to explain what is doubtful in another.” 
(quoting Barnett v. State, 91 Hawaiʻ i 20, 31, 979 P.2d 1046, 1057 
(1999))).  
 HRS § 291E-11 provides in relevant part:  
(a) Any person who operates a vehicle upon a public 
way, street, road, or highway . . . of the State 
shall be deemed to have given consent, subject to 
this part, to a test or tests approved by the 
director of health of the person’s breath, blood, or 
urine for the purpose of determining alcohol concentration . . . of the person’s breath, blood, or 
urine, as applicable. 
 
(b) 
The test or tests shall be administered at the 
request of a law enforcement officer having probable 
cause to believe the person operating a vehicle upon 
a public way, street, road, or highway . . . of the 
State is under the influence of an intoxicant or is under the age of twenty- one and has consumed a 
measurable amount of alcohol, only after:  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
12 
  
 (1)  A lawful arrest; and 
 
 (2) The person has been informed by a law 
enforcement officer that the person may refuse 
to submit to testing under this chapter. 
 
(Emphases added.) 
 While HRS § 291E-11, on its own, suggests that OVUII 
arrestees need only be provided with one opportunity to refuse, it is clear from other statutes within HRS Chapter 291E that an 
additional advisement must be afforded to OVUII arrestees who refuse to submit to testing. 
 At the time of Hosaka’s offense, for instance, HRS 
§ 291E-15 (Supp. 2011),
7 which governs the imposition of 
sanctions, required law enforcement officers to give arrestees a 
second opportunity to refuse after advising them of possible 
sanctions: 
If a person under arrest refuses to submit to a 
breath, blood, or urine test, none shall be given, 
except as provided in section 291E- 21.  Upon the law 
enforcement officer’s determination that the person under arrest has refused to submit to a breath, 
blood, or urine test, if applicable, then a law 
enforcement officer shall: 
 
                     
7   At the time Hosaka was arrested, HRS § 291E- 15 also required law 
enforcement to advise an arrestee of the possible criminal sanctions under HRS § 291E- 68.  However, in 2016, HRS § 291E- 68 was repealed by the 
legislature in response to this court’s decision in Won, 137 Hawaiʻ i
 330, 372 
P.3d 1065 (holding that burdening a defendant’s right to refuse to submit to 
BAC testing under the threat of criminal sanctions was inherently coercive).  
See 2016 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 17, § 2 at 21.  At that time, the legislature 
also amended HRS § 291E- 15 to remove its reference to HRS § 291E- 68.  See id. 
§ 1 at 21.  Because of these legislative amendments and because Hosaka was 
never advised of any possible criminal sanctions, it is not necessary to 
address HRS § 291E- 68 as a requirement in the instant case.  Therefore, our 
analysis applies to the current version of HRS § 291E- 15 as well as the 
version in place at the time of Hosaka’s arrest.  
  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
13    (continued . . .)  
  (1) Inform the person under arrest of the 
sanctions under section 291E- 41 [or] 291E
-65 . . . 
and 
 
 (2)  Ask the person if the person still 
refuses to submit to a breath, blood, or urine test, 
thereby subjecting the person to the procedures and 
sanctions under part III or section 291E- 65, as 
applicable[.] 
 
(Emphasis added.)  
 HRS § 291E-65, which governs sanctions for persons 
under 21 arrested for operating a vehicle after consuming a measurable amount of alcohol, likewise requires an officer to 
ask if an arrestee “still” refuses after informing them of 
sanctions.
8  Similarly, HRS § 291E-41, which establishes the 
                     
8 HRS § 291E- 65 provides in relevant part: 
  
 (a)  If a person under arrest for operating a 
vehicle after consuming a measurable amount of 
alcohol, pursuant to section 291E
-64, refuses to 
submit to a breath or blood test, none shall be given, except as provided in section 291E- 21, but the 
arresting law enforcement officer, as soon as 
practicable, shall submit an affidavit to a district 
judge of the circuit in which the arrest was made, 
stating: 
  (1) That at the time of the arrest, the 
arresting officer had probable cause to believe the 
arrested person was under the age of twenty 
-one and 
had been operating a vehicle upon a public way, street, road, or highway or on or in the waters of 
the State with a measurable amount of alcohol; 
  (2) That the arrested person was informed 
that the person may refuse to submit to a breath or blood test, in compliance with section 291E
-11;  
  (3) That the person had refused
  to submit to 
a breath or blood test; 
  (4) That the arrested person was:
  
 
(A) Informed of the sanctions of this

(2)Of the sanctions of this part and then
asked if the person still refuses to submit to a 
breath, blood, or urine test, in compliance with the 
requirements of section 291E- 15, 
the revocation imposed . . . shall be for a period of 
two years, three years, four years, or ten years, respectively [depending on the number of prior 
alcohol- related law enforcement contacts]
. 
(Emphasis added.) 
These statutes, when read together, demonstrate that 
before sanctions for refusal can be imposed, law enforcement 
must follow a two-step procedure: first, an OVUII arrestee must 
be given an opportunity to refuse to submit to testing; second, 
if the arrestee refuses, the arrestee must then be informed of 
the specific sanctions that could result and asked whether they 
still refuse testing.

15 [P]olice officers are [] required to read an
inordinate amount of information to a suspect of
DUII.  This measure is an attempt to simplify [the
implied consent] process while protecting the rightsof the accused by clarifying that information on the
consequences of refusing to submit to a blood,breath, or urine test only need to be read to an
individual if the individual refuses to submit to
such a test.  Your Committee believes that this bill
will support law enforcement and increase traffic
safety.
H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 310-06, in 2006 House Journal, at 1218.
The Senate Committee on Judiciary and Hawaiian Affairs 
similarly explained that the purpose of the bill was to 
“considerably reduce the amount of time spent by the police in 
processing persons arrested for [OVUII]” by requiring that 
police “inform a person arrested . . . of the sanctions for 
refusal to submit to [a] breath, blood, or urine test only if 
[a] person withdraws [their implied] consent to testing[.]”  S.

(emphasis added).
9H.B. 3257 was introduced by the legislature in 2006 and 
eventually was enacted into law as Act 64.  See 2006 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 64, 
at 96-101. For example, the House Committee on Transportation explained 
that the purpose of amending the implied consent statutory 
scheme was to streamline the implied consent process by only 
requiring officers to advise arrestees of the sanctions that 
could be imposed if the arrestee had already refused testing:this interpretation of the implied consent statutory scheme.  
See H.B. 3257, H.D. 1, S.D. 2, 23rd Leg., Reg. Sess. (2006).9

16 
  Accordingly, we hold that under HRS Chapter 291E, an 
OVUII arrestee who initially refuses to submit to chemical 
testing must be given a second opportunity to refuse after being 
advised of the possible sanctions. 
 2. 
The HPD’s implied consent form complied with HRS 
Chapter 291E 
 
 However, the fact that officers must follow a two-step 
procedure before sanctions can be imposed does not mean that the 
form in this case violated HRS Chapter 291E: Hosaka did not 
initially refuse chemical testing, and so HRS § 291E-15, which 
establishes the two-step procedure discussed above, does not 
apply to Hosaka’s case.  See HRS § 291E-15 (“Upon the law 
enforcement officer’s determination that the person under arrest has refused to submit to a breath, blood, or urine test . . . .”).  The requirements of HRS § 291E-15 are only 
triggered if the arrestee initially refuses; they do not apply 
to arrestees who, like Hosaka, choose not to withdraw their 
consent to chemical testing when first asked. 
 Most importantly, however, the two-step procedure does 
not require that an arrestee’s initial refusal be “completely 
unencumbered,” as the circuit court believed.  HRS Chapter 291E permits law enforcement to tell arrestees that they “may” be 
subject to sanctions when giving the first implied consent 
advisal.  The plain language of HRS § 291E-11 provides that a ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
17 B. Hosaka Voluntarily Consented to a Breath Test Under the
Totality of the Circumstances 
Having determined that the implied consent form did 
not violate statutory mandates, we turn to Hosaka’s remaining 
arguments that his consent was not knowing, intelligent, and 
voluntary because the form contained inaccurate and misleading 
information under Wilson and was inherently coercive under Won. 
10We disagree with the ICA that sanctions could have been imposed 
under HRS § 291E- 15 based solely on the implied consent form used to advise 
Hosaka initially.  As discussed above, HRS Chapter 291E requires that 
an 
arrestee be given two opportunities to consent to chemical testing, and HRS 
§291E-15 only applies if an arrestee initially refuses testing.  After that
first refusal, HRS § 291E- 15(1) requires that a law enforcement officer
“[i]nform the person under arrest of the sanctions under section 291E- 41 [or]
291E-65[.]”  Thus, HRS § 291E- 15 requires an arrestee be informed of the
sanctions which could apply — not simply that unspecified sanctions may
exist.  As Form HPD- 396K informed an arrestee only that sanctions “may”
result and did not explain what the potential sanctions were, law enforcementwould have to conduct a more detailed advisement in compliance with HRS

) an 
advisement that the arrestee has the right to refuse.  HRS § 
291E-11(b).  It does not prohibit a law enforcement officer from 
telling an arrestee, as part of that first advisement, that sanctions 
“may” be imposed for a refusal.  Similarly, even if HRS § 291E-15 
applied to Hosaka, the statute does not prohibit officers from 
advising arrestees of possible sanctions when they first ask an 
arrestee to submit to a chemical test and then later providing a more 
specific explanation of the potential sanctions if an arrestee 
refuses.   Accordingly, we conclude that the implied consent form 
complied with HRS Chapter 291E.10

  1. Wilson does not support suppression of chemical test 
results solely due to an inaccurate or incomplete 
implied consent form 
   
 The circuit court concluded that the implied consent 
form was inaccurate and therefore that this court’s decision in 
Wilson, 92 Hawaiʻ i 45, 987 P.2d 268, required the suppression of 
Hosaka’s breath test results.  According to the circuit court, 
because the form in this case did not follow the required two-
step procedure set forth in HRS § 291E-15, sanctions could never 
have been imposed, so it was inaccurate for the form to advise 
Hosaka that they “may” have been.  We disagree. 
 First, we conclude that the implied consent form was 
accurate.  It advised Hosaka that if he refused chemical testing, he “may [] be subject to the procedures and sanctions 
under chapter 291E, part III.”  That was a true statement: At 
the time Hosaka was advised, sanctions could have been imposed 
if he refused and continued to refuse after being advised of the 
possible sanctions, as required by HRS § 291E-15.  Although the 
imposition of sanctions required additional steps, the 
possibility of sanctions for a refusal existed even at the beginning of Hosaka’s implied consent advisal.  HPD’s form 
accurately explains this possibility by telling arrestees that 
if they refused, they “may” be subject to the procedures and 
sanctions in the implied consent statute.  
 However, even if we determined that HPD’s implied  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
19 
 consent form was potentially misleading, that fact alone does 
not warrant suppression.  We take this opportunity to reiterate 
that the constitution requires knowing, intelligent, and 
voluntary consent — not compliance with every technical 
requirement in the implied consent statutory scheme.  See Won, 
137 Hawaiʻ i at 354, 372 P.3d at 1089 (“[T]he question of whether 
the implied consent statute is adhered to is separate and 
distinct from the constitutional inquiry into whether there is 
actual consent to BAC testing under HRS § 291E-11(b).”).  Thus, 
the operative question is whether any defects in the form were 
likely to influence an arrestee’s decision whether to consent.  
 In Wilson, the implied consent advisement informed 
arrestees, “[I]f you refuse to take any tests . . . your driving privileges will be revoked for one year instead of the three 
month revocation that would apply if you chose to take the test 
and failed it[.]”  92 Hawaiʻ i at 47, 987 P.2d at 270.  That 
advisement was wholly incorrect — if a driver failed to take a test, their driving privileges could be revoked for “anywhere 
from three months to one year.”  Id.  We found that the nature 
of the misrepresentation — that Wilson’s driver’s license would be suspended for less time if he took a test and failed, than if 
he refused a test — “was relevant to [the defendant’s] decision 
whether to agree to or refuse the blood alcohol test.”  Id. at 
51, 987 P.2d at 274.  As a result of the form’s  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
20 
 misrepresentation, we held that suppression was necessary. 
 Wilson stands for the fundamental principle that 
police officers may not induce an arrestee into not withdrawing 
their implied consent by giving an inaccurate or misleading 
implied consent advisement.  Thus, we held that “where a change 
in wording of the implied consent warnings operates to convey a 
different meaning than that specified in the statute, the driver 
cannot be held to have made a knowing and intelligent decision whether to submit to an evidentiary alcohol test.”  Wilson, 92 
Hawaiʻi at 50, 987 P.2d at 273. 
 We recognize that in Wilson we stated, “the arresting 
officer’s violation of [the implied consent statute’s] consent requirement precludes admissibility of Wilson’s blood test 
results in his related criminal DUI proceeding.”  Id. at 53–54, 
987 P.2d at 276–77.  However, this does not mean that any imperfection in the implied consent form mandates suppression of 
the chemical test results.  The implied consent form in Wilson 
omitted the maximum possible administrative sanction to create the misleading and inaccurate impression that the penalty for refusing of a chemical test would be worse than submitting to a 
test and failing.  This misrepresentation was of the type 
reasonably likely to influence an arrestee into consenting to a 
chemical test; therefore, the arrestee’s consent was not ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
21 11We emphasize that the constitutional infirmity in Wilson was not 
the incomplete advisement per se, but the nature of the incompleteness — the 
implied consent form omitted a substantive fact that rendered it misleading. knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.11  Id. at 47, 987 P.2d at 270; 
cf. State
 v. Matsumoto, 145 Hawaiʻi 313, 324, 452 P.3d 310, 321 
(2019) (“[D]eliberate
 falsehoods extrinsic to the facts of the 
alleged offense,
 which are of a type reasonably likely 
to .
 . . influence an accused to make a confession regardless of 
guilt, []
 will be regarded as coercive per se.” (quoting State v. 
Kelekolio, 
74 Haw. 479, 512–13, 849 P.2d 58, 73–74 (1993))(emphases 
added)).
  
Wilson involved an inaccurate advisement informing an 
arrestee 
that the length of a driver’s license suspension would be 
three 
months instead of one year, an inaccuracy we characterized as 
“substantive” and “substantial,” and which was reasonably likely to 
influence an
 arrestee’s decision.  92 Hawai‘i at 53 n.11, 987 P.2d 
at 276
 n.11. Accordingly, Wilson should not be read to invalidate 
consent due
 solely to minor defects in the implied consent advisory 
that 
are unlikely to do so.
In this case, the implied consent form accurately informed 
Hosaka of the possible sanctions and did not omit any important 
information that could have influenced his decision whether to 
withdraw his implied consent.  Even if the statement that 
sanctions “may” be imposed is considered misleading because 
intervening steps would have to take place before that could ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
22 happen, any inaccuracy was slight and unlikely to affect an 
arrestee’s decision whether to consent to a chemical test.  
Accordingly, suppression is not warranted under Wilson.    
2. HPD’s implied consent form was not coercive under Won
Hosaka further argues that under this court’s decision
in Won, 137 Hawaiʻ i 330, 372 P.3d 1065, the mere mention of 
sanctions in the implied consent form was coercive and therefore 
mandates suppression of the breath test results.  The circuit 
court agreed, concluding that even though Won involved criminal 
sanctions for a refusal, “under the reasoning of Won, burdening 
an arrestee’s election to refuse with any significant sanctions 
cannot help but render any subsequent purported consent legally 
insufficient and therefore null and void.”  We disagree with the 
circuit court’s interpretation of Won. 
In Won, the defendant consented to a chemical test 
after being advised that if he refused chemical testing he would 
“be subject to up to thirty days imprisonment and/or fine up to 
$1,000 or the sanctions of 291E-65, if applicable.”  Id. at 335, 
372 P.3d at 1070 (emphasis omitted).  We held that “[w]here 
arrest, conviction, and imprisonment are threatened if consent 
to search is not given, the threat infringes upon and oppresses 
the unfettered will and free choice of the person to whom it is 
made, whether by calculation or effect.”  Id. at 346, 372 P.3d 
at 1081.  Notably, we concluded that in addition to the sheer  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
23 
 threat of criminal punishment, the advisement was especially 
coercive because “the choice presented by the Implied Consent 
Form forces a defendant to elect between fundamental rights 
guaranteed by the Hawaiʻ i Constitution,” and the duration of 
possible imprisonment for a refusal was significantly higher 
than the possible imprisonment for a first OVUII offense.  Id. 
at 347-48, 372 P.3d at 1082-83 (emphasis omitted). 
 However, we also explicitly distinguished 
administrative sanctions from the threat of criminal prosecution and imprisonment: “It bears repeating here that this opinion 
does not concern the civil administrative penalties attendant to 
a driver’s refusal of BAC testing.  See HRS § 291E–41(d) (Supp. 
[2012]); see generally HRS Chapter 291E, Part III.  Those types 
of sanctions are not affected in any way by our decision.”  Id. 
at 349 n.34, 372 P.3d at 1084 n.34.  Given Won’s repeated 
references to the coercive nature of the criminal sanctions at issue, the circuit court erred in concluding that Won prohibited 
“any significant sanction burdening a defendant’s choice to refuse.” 
 Here, the implied consent form that Hosaka signed can 
be distinguished from the form in Won: it did not threaten 
Hosaka with arrest or imprisonment for refusing a chemical test; 
it did not require him to choose between constitutional rights; 
and it did not advise him, as the forms in both Won and Wilson  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
24 
 did, that the punishment for refusal would be worse than the 
punishment for failing a chemical test.  Even if a threat of 
administrative sanctions could be coercive under some 
circumstances, the circumstances here do not rise to that level.  
Moreover, there are no other factors (and certainly no other 
factual findings regarding such factors) that could have been 
coercive or that suggest Hosaka was, in fact, coerced.  Thus, as 
the totality of the circumstances demonstrates that Hosaka voluntarily consented to the breath test, the results of that 
test are admissible. 
V.  CONCLUSION 
 We hold that the implied consent form in this case 
complied with HRS Chapter 291E and was not inaccurate or misleading.  Further, we clarify that not all inaccuracies in 
implied consent forms require suppression of chemical testing 
results: only inaccuracies that are reasonably likely to 
influence an arrestee to consent will require suppression. Similarly, informing an arrestee of possible civil sanctions 
does not make an advisement automatically coercive.  As the 
implied consent form here was not inaccurate or coercive, and 
the circuit court did not find that any of the other 
circumstances of Hosaka’s advisal were coercive, Hosaka 
knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily consented to the 
breath test, and the results of the breath test are admissible.
