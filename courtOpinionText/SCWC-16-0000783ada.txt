 alleging that their directly-adjacent neighbor, Defendant 
Elizabeth Rawsthorne, was in breach of a restrictive covenant 
contained in the Ali‘ i Heights Subdivision’s Declaration of 
Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions for Ali‘ i
 Heights 
Subdivision, Phase I (Declaration).  Section 3.14 of the 
Declaration states: “Trees/Shrubs: Trees, shrubs, bushes, hedges 
and all other plants on every lot shall be maintained at a 
reasonable height so as not to interfere with the viewplanes 
[sic] available to any other lot.”  After a bench trial, the 
circuit court ordered that Rawsthorne maintain any plants on her 
property at a height not to exceed the roofline of her 
residence, and awarded the Gailliards $40,000.00 in damages plus 
attorney’s fees in the amount of $28,618.09.  The Intermediate 
Court of Appeals (ICA) affirmed in a summary disposition order (SDO).  The ICA additionally granted the Gailliards’ motion for 
attorney’s fees on appeal, awarding the Gailliards $15,706.00. 1
   
  Rawsthorne’s application for writ of certiorari 
argues, inter alia, that the ICA erred in awarding the 
Gailliards appellate attorney’s fees for the total amount 
requested, as Hawai‘ i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 607-142 limits the 
                     
1  As set forth below, Rawsthorne did not challenge the circuit 
court’s attorney’s fees award in her appeal to the ICA.  Thus, the ICA did 
not address that award.    
 
2  HRS § 607- 14 states in relevant part:  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 amount a party may receive in attorney’s fees to 25% of the 
total award.  We agree and hold that the ICA should have limited 
its appellate attorney’s fees award to $10,000 - 25% of the 
$40,000 damages award the Gailliards received.  Because 
Rawsthorne did not appeal the circuit court’s order granting 
attorney’s fees, we decline to address that award.  We 
accordingly vacate in part the ICA’s judgment on appeal awarding 
the Gailliards attorney’s fees on appeal for the full amount requested, and remand to the ICA with instructions to adjust the 
appellate attorney’s fees award to $10,000 plus excise tax.  We 
otherwise affirm the ICA’s judgment on appeal.  
II. BACKGROUND 
  Rawsthorne purchased her property in December 2009.  
The Gailliards purchased their lot, located mauka
3 of 
Rawsthorne’s lot, in September 2012.  Both properties are 
subject to the “Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and 
Restrictions for Alii Heights Subdivision, Phase 1,” which was 
                     
In all the courts , in all actions in the nature of 
assumpsit and in all actions on a promissory note or other 
contract in writing that provides for an attorney’s fee, 
there shall be taxed as attorney’s fees, to be paid by the 
losing party and to be included in the sum for which execution may issue, a fee that the court determines to be 
reasonable . . . provided that this amount shall not exceed 
twenty-five per cent of the judgment.   
 
3  The Hawaiian D ictionary defines the term “M auka” as “Uka” meaning 
“inland, upland, towards the mountain[.] ”  See Mary Kawena Pukui & Samuel H. 
Elbert, Hawaiian Dictionary 242, 365 (1986) .   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 recorded in the State of Hawai‘ i Bureau of Conveyances on 
January 28, 2003.   
  Jodi Gailliard first approached Rawsthorne on November 21, 2013, to request that she trim her trees and other 
plants in order to restore and preserve the Gailliards’ view 
planes in conformity with the Declaration.  Rawsthorne responded 
by stating that there is no homeowners’ association at Ali‘ i 
Heights, therefore the Declaration is unenforceable, and the 
Gailliards’ only remedy was to “move.”  Following this 
interaction, the Gailliards retained legal counsel and began to 
send demand letters to Rawsthorne.  After a second demand 
letter, Rawsthorne removed or trimmed approximately 50 of her 
plants.  
 
  
Despite Rawsthorne’s attempts to meet the Gailliards’ 
demands, on or around July 14, 2014, John Gailliard went to Rawsthorne’s property to discuss her plants and requested that 
Rawsthorne “come up to his property so they could see how [the 
Gailliards’] views were obstructed.”  Rawsthorne refused, 
“interpret[ing] the request as a demand that [Rawsthorne] 
completely clear their backyard of any vegetation that [the 
Gailliards] found objectionable.”  The Gailliards filed a complaint in the circuit court, which they later amended.  In 
the amended complaint, the Gailliards raised two claims: a 
breach of contract claim, and a claim for injunctive relief.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
5 
   After a bench trial, the circuit court4 found in favor 
of the Gailliards on the breach of contract claim.  In its 
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Regarding Jury 
Waived Trial (Order) filed on March 30, 2016, the circuit court 
concluded that Rawsthorne’s plants “interfere[d] with [the 
Gailliards’] view planes” and thus “violated Section 3.14 of the 
Declaration,” and ordered Rawsthorne “trim and maintain” her 
plants so they would not exceed “the roofline of” Rawsthorne’s property.  Moreover, the circuit court concluded that the 
Gailliards’ “property value was diminished by $40,000 for the 
period of [Rawsthorne’s] breach of contract, specifically of 
Section 3.14 of the Declaration,” and awarded damages in the 
amount of $40,000.00.  The circuit court also awarded 
“Plaintiffs reasonable attorney[’]s fees and costs pursuant to 
Section 6.5(b)[
5] of the Declaration.”  The circuit court 
determined that count two of the Gailliards’ complaint 
requesting injunctive relief was moot.   
  Rawsthorne filed a motion for reconsideration 
contending, among other things, that the circuit court “did not 
                     
4  The Honorable Melvin H. Fujino presided. 
 
5  Section 6.5(b) of the Declaration states: “If a legal proceeding 
is brought to enforce the requirements, restrictions and other provisions set 
forth in this Declaration, or any of them, the prevailing party or parties 
shall be entitled to have and recover from the losing party or parties reasonable attorney[’]s fees and costs of suit.”

 enter a single finding of fact” supporting that Rawsthorne 
violated the Covenant.  The circuit court denied Rawsthorne’s 
motion, concluding that “no new evidence and/or arguments were 
presented which could not have been presented during the earlier 
adjudicated motion.”   
  The Gailliards moved for attorney’s fees, requesting $59,346.18.  Rawsthorne opposed the request, arguing, inter 
alia, that the requested amount exceeded the 25% cap under HRS § 
607-14.  The Gailliards argued in reply that the 25% cap did not 
apply because the Ali‘ i Heights Subdivision was a planned 
community association, 
see HRS § 607-14, and because the 
Gailliards sought and obtained non-monetary relief, see Food 
Pantry, Ltd. v. Waikiki Bus. Plaza, Inc., 58 Haw. 606, 575 P.2d 
869 (1978).6  Following a hearing on the motion, the circuit 
court issued its Order Regarding Plaintiffs’ Submission of 
Attorney’s Fees and Costs on July 14, 2016, and granted the 
Gailliards an attorney’s fees award of $28,618.09, reducing the 
amount requested by half for the Gailliards’ failure to 
apportion the work.7  The circuit court did not expressly address 
                     
6  Neither the Gailliards nor Rawsthorne raised the applicability of 
Food Pantry on appeal to the ICA or in this court, and accordingly, we do not 
address it further here. 
 
7  The court reduced the Gailliards’ amended request of $53,994.35 
to $28,618.09 by removing the cost of the expert report for untimeliness, 
reducing the fees for clerical matters, and reducing the remaining award by 
50% for the Gailliards’ failure to “apportion the amount of time spent on 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
7 
 Rawsthorne’s argument that HRS § 607-14 limited the attorney’s 
fees the Gailliards may collect to 25% of the damages award.  
However, the attorney’s fees awarded by the circuit court 
exceeded 25% of the judgment.  The circuit court entered its 
Final Judgment against Rawsthorne on August 24, 2016.   
  Rawsthorne appealed.  In her Opening Brief, Rawsthorne 
argued the circuit court erred in concluding she violated the Declaration.  Rawsthorne did not challenge the circuit court’s attorney’s fees award.   
  The ICA affirmed the judgment, and the Gailliards 
filed a motion for appellate attorney’s fees requesting an 
additional $15,706.00
8 pursuant to HRS § 607-14 and Sections 3.14 
and 6.5 of the Declaration.  Rawsthorne again argued that “[b]ecause Appellees are requesting an award of attorney’s fees 
pursuant to the authority in HRS § 607-14, which limits such awards to 25% of the judgment exclusive of fees and costs, 
Appellant objects to any award of attorney’s fees to Appellees 
over $10,000.”   
                     
claims outside of the claims awarded.”   
   
8  An attached declaration of counsel indicated that counsel had 
“elected to defend this appeal for $15,000 plus excise tax of $706, 
representing 75 hours at $200 an hour,” and attached an exhibit detailing 75 hours of work performed by counsel.  Rawsthorne opposed the motion and 
argued, as relevant here, that “[t]he billing statement attached . . . 
contains charges for clerical work including 2.0 hours . . . to ‘Draft Conclusion, Tables, Certificate of Service’ and 2.0 hours on March 16, 2018 
to ‘Proof, reduce, E- File AB; email copy to Whittaker and John[.]’”   
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

   In their reply brief, the Gailliards argued that the 
Ali‘i Heights Subdivision was a planned community association, 
and thus exempted from the 25% cap on attorney’s fees awards 
under HRS § 607-14.9  Gailliard also contended that: 
Appellants challenged the fees and costs below, citing the 
same 25% limitation in HRS Section 607- 14, and the court 
rejected that argument and awarded Appellees $28,618 in 
fees and costs, or 70% of the $40,000 judgment.  When they 
appealed, Appellants did not challenge the fee award, the 
amount of fees, or the court’s ruling on HRS Section 607-
14.  That ruling is law of the case.   
  
(Emphasis omitted and added.)  
  The ICA awarded the Gailliards attorney’s fees on 
appeal for $15,706.00, the entire amount requested.  The award 
exceeded 25% of the circuit court’s damages award.10  In its 
order, the ICA concluded that “the attorney’s fees in the 
requested amount of $15,706.00 [were] reasonable.”   
  Rawsthorne timely filed her application for writ of 
certiorari and argues that the ICA erred by: (1) concluding the 
language of the Covenant was not vague or ambiguous so as to 
render the Covenant unenforceable; (2) concluding Rawsthorne 
violated the Covenant; (3) concluding the circuit court properly 
                     
9  HRS § 607- 14 additionally states, in relevant part, “Nothing in 
this section shall limit the recovery of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs 
by a planned community association and its members in actions for the . . . 
enforcement of any provision of the association’s governing documents[.]”   
 
10  Although the ICA cited HRS § 607- 14 in its order approving 
attorney’s fees on appeal, it did not address Rawsthorne’s argument that a 
planned community association did not exist at the Ali‘ i Heights Subdivision 
and thus the property is subject to the 25% statutory cap on attorney’s fees under that statute.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 awarded the Gailliards damages for diminution of value without 
first establishing the period of time for when such an award was 
proper; (4) concluding the circuit court did not abuse its 
discretion in denying Rawsthorne’s motion for reconsideration; 
and (5) awarding the Gailliards attorney’s fees of $15,706.00.   
  In support of her fifth point, Rawsthorne argues that the ICA erred in awarding the Gailliards $15,706.00 in 
attorney’s fees on appeal because “there is no planned community association for the Alii Heights Subdivision,” and thus the 
“planned community association exception” is inapplicable.  
Accordingly, the appellate fee award should have been capped at 
$10,000.00.  Additionally, Rawsthorne argues that “the ICA 
awarded attorney’s fees for time spent on clerical tasks,” and 
that “[c]ourts should reduce an award of attorney’s fees 
for . . . performance of clerical functions.”  (Quoting Schefke 
v. Reliable Collection Agency, Ltd., 96 Hawai‘ i 408, 458, 32 P.3d 
52, 102 (2001).)   
  In response to Rawsthorne’s certiorari application, 
the Gailliards argue, among other things, that the Ali‘ i Heights 
subdivision is a planned community association within the meaning of HRS § 607-14, and thus, the 25% limit on attorney’s fees does not apply.  Moreover, the Gailliards contend that 
Rawsthorne argued at the circuit court that HRS § 607-14 limited 
the attorney’s fees award the Gailliards may recover, but the *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
10 
 circuit court rejected this argument when it granted the 
Gailliards’ attorney’s fees award exceeding 25% of the judgment.  
The Gailliards argued that Rawsthorne “did not challenge that 
ruling on appeal.  As such, [Rawsthorne] clearly waived any 
objection on these specific grounds on appeal.”   
  The Gailliards next contend that “proofing and 
reducing a brief to bring it into compliance with court rules[ ] 
is an essential task by appellate counsel, and not a clerical function.” (Internal quotations omitted.) 
  Rawsthorne replied, and asserts that “[a]n award of 
appellate attorney’s fees is not dependent on attorney’s fees being awarded by the trial court,” and thus her decision not to 
appeal the circuit court’s attorney’s fees award is irrelevant.  
Stated differently, Rawsthorne believed that her decision not to 
appeal the circuit court’s attorney’s fees award did not preclude her from challenging the ICA’s appellate attorney’s 
fees awards.   
  Rawsthorne additionally cites Employee Management 
Corp. v. Aloha Group, Ltd., 87 Hawai‘ i 350, 351, 956 P.2d 1282, 
1283 (App. 1998), and contends, for the first time on appeal, that HRS § 607-14 “places a twenty-five percent maximum combined 
total limit that can be taxed against a losing party by both the 
trial and appellate courts.”  (Emphases added.)  “The trial court and ICA have together awarded [the Gailliards] $44,324 in *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
11 
 attorney’s fees on a $40,000 judgment.  Based on the express 
words and holding of the ICA in Aloha Group, the award of 
attorney’s fees over $10,000 . . . is a grave error.”  In other words, Rawsthorne contends that the total amount of attorney’s 
fees awarded by both the circuit court and the ICA should not 
have exceeded $10,000.00. 
III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A.  Attorney’s Fees   
 “It is well settled that no attorney’s fees may be 
awarded as damages or costs unless so provided by statute, stipulation, or agreement.”  Hawaiian Isles Enters., Inc. v. 
City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 76 Hawai‘ i 487, 489, 879 P.2d 1070, 
1072 (1994) (citations, brackets and quotations marks omitted).  
“The construction and legal effect given a contract provision 
governing the award of attorneys’ fees is a question of law, 
which we review under the right/wrong standard.”  Id. (citation 
omitted).  
  “[The Hawai‘ i Supreme Court] reviews the . . . denial 
and granting of attorney’s fees under the abuse of discretion standard. . . .  An abuse of discretion occurs where the [court] 
has clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of 
a party litigant.”  Oahu Publ’ns, Inc. v. Abercrombie, 134 
Hawai‘i 16, 22, 332 P.3d 159, 165 (2014) (quotation marks and *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
12 
 citations omitted).   
B. Findings of Fact (FOF)/Conclusions of Law (COL)  
 
  “In this jurisdiction, a trial court’s FOFs are 
subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review.  An FOF is 
clearly erroneous when, despite evidence to support the finding, 
the appellate court is left with the definite and firm 
conviction that a mistake has been committed.”  Chun v. Bd. of 
Trs. of the Emps.’ Ret. Sys. of the State of Hawai‘ i, 106 Hawai‘ i 
416, 430, 106 P.3d 339, 353 (2005) (internal quotation marks, 
citations, and ellipses omitted) (quoting State v. Hutch, 75 
Haw. 307, 328, 861 P.2d 11, 22 (1993)).   
A COL is not binding upon an appellate court and is freely 
reviewable for its correctness.  [The appellate court] 
ordinarily reviews COLs under the right/wrong standard.  Thus, a COL that is supported by the trial court’ s FOFs and 
that reflects an application of the correct rule of law will not be overturned.  However, a COL that presents mixed 
questions of fact and law is reviewed under the clearly 
erroneous standard because the court's conclusions are dependent upon the facts and circumstances of each 
individual case. 
 
Chun, 106 Hawai‘ i at 430, 106 P.3d at 353 (internal quotation 
marks, citations, and brackets omitted) (quoting Allstate Ins. 
Co. v. Ponce, 105 Hawai‘ i 445, 453, 99 P.3d 96, 104 (2004)). 
C.  Motion for Reconsideration  
 
[T]he purpose of a motion for reconsideration is to allow 
the parties to present new evidence and/or arguments that 
could not have been presented during the earlier adjudicated motion.  Reconsideration is not a device to 
relitigate old matters or to raise arguments or evidence 
that could and should have been brought during the earlier 
proceeding.

Miller, 92 Hawai‘ i 505, 513, 993 P.2d 539, 547 (2000)).   
  The appellate court reviews a “trial court’s ruling on 
a motion for reconsideration . . . under the abuse of discretion 
standard.”  Wailea Elua, 100 Hawai‘ i at 110, 58 P.3d at 621.  An 
abuse of discretion occurs if the trial court has “clearly 
exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles 
of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant.”  Amfac, Inc. v. Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co., 74 Haw. 
85, 114, 839 P.2d 10, 26 (1992). 
IV. DISCUSSION 
A.  The ICA Erred in Awarding the Gailliards $15,706.00 in 
 Attorney’s Fees on Appeal  
  1. The twenty-five percent cap on attorney’s fees under  
  HRS § 607-14 applies to the Ali‘ i Heights Subdivision  
 
 as it is not a “planned community association” as  
  defined by the statute. 
 
  HRS § 607-14 defines a planned community association 
as “a nonprofit homeowners or community association existing 
pursuant to covenants running with the land.”  In order to 
qualify under the planned community associations exception, the 
court must determine whether: (1) there is a nonprofit community 
association, and (2) the association “exist[s] pursuant to 
covenants running with the land.”  See Kaanapali Hillside *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
14 
 Homeowners’ Ass’n ex rel. Bd. Of Dirs. v. Doran, 114 Hawai‘ i 361, 
372, 162 P.3d 1277, 1288 (2007).  The Gailliards contend that 
Rawsthorne raised this argument in her memorandum in opposition to the Gailliards’ declaration requesting attorney’s fees 
totaling $53,994.35 filed in the circuit court, but did not 
appeal the circuit court’s order awarding attorney’s fees 
totaling over 25% of the judgment, thus waiving the argument.  
Stated another way, Rawsthorne’s decision not to challenge the 
fee award accordingly resulted in the circuit court’s ruling as 
to the “planned community association” question becoming the “law of the case.”   
  The Gailliards are correct that Rawsthorne’s application for writ of certiorari seeks review of only the 
ICA’s attorney’s fees award, and thus any objection to the 
circuit court’s attorney’s fees award is “deemed to have been 
waived on appeal.”  See State v. Moses, 102 Hawai‘ i 449, 456, 77 
P.3d 940, 947 (2003); Hawai‘ i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
Rule 28(b)(7) (“Points not argued may be deemed waived.”).   
  However, the Gailliards are incorrect that 
Rawsthorne’s decision not to appeal the circuit court’s award of 
attorney’s fees precludes our review of the ICA’s award of 
appellate attorney’s fees.  The awards are separate, and 
Rawsthorne’s decision not to appeal the circuit court’s 
attorney’s fees award does not bar her from challenging *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
15 
 attorney’s fees awarded on appeal.  Cf. S. Utsunomiya Enters., 
Inc. v. Moomuku Country Club, 76 Hawai‘ i 396, 402, 879 P.2d 501, 
507 (1994) (holding that attorney’s fees incurred at trial and 
on appeal are separate).    
  Moreover, the Gailliards’ argument that the “law of the case” doctrine bars Rawsthorne from reraising the argument 
that the 25% limit on attorney’s fees awarded under HRS § 607-14 
applies to the Ali‘ i Heights Subdivision is no more persuasive.  
This court recently held that “when a court decides upon a rule 
of law, that decision should continue to govern the same issue 
in subsequent stages in the same case.”  PennyMac Corp. v. 
Godinez, 148 Hawai‘ i 323, 331, 474 P.3d 264, 272 (2020) (citing 
Arizona v. California, 460 U.S. 605, 618 (1983)).  In PennyMac, 
this court recognized that “the [law of the case] doctrine can also be invoked by a trial court with respect to its own 
rulings, and in that instance, the doctrine is discretionary and operates as a presumption against reconsideration.”  Id. at 331, 
474 P.3d at 272 (citation omitted).  Moreover, “when the law of the case has been established by an appellate court, the lower 
court is obliged to apply it.”  Id. at 331 n.10, 474 P.3d at 272 
n.10 (citing Ditto v. McCurdy, 98 Hawai‘ i 123, 128, 44 P.3d 274, 
279 (2002) (quotation marks omitted)).  However, we have not 
previously addressed whether and how the doctrine operates in *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
16 
 the circumstances of the instant case: where a circuit court 
rules on an issue of law, a party chooses not to appeal, and the 
appellate court is tasked with addressing the same issue in a 
different circumstance.  
  However, other jurisdictions have concluded that the law of the case doctrine does not bind appellate courts to a 
ruling made by a lower court.  Indeed, the United States Supreme 
Court has held that the law of the case doctrine “cannot bind 
[the Supreme Court] in reviewing decisions” of lower courts.  
See Christianson v. Colt Indus. Operating Corp., 486 U.S. 800, 
803 (1988) (emphasis added); accord In re Raynor, 617 F.3d 1065, 
1069 (8th Cir. 2010) (holding that the law of the case doctrine 
does not apply in a case “involv[ing] direct appellate 
review . . . of trial and intermediary appellate decisions.  In 
doing so, [the reviewing court is] not bound by the decisions of inferior courts, even lower courts acting as an appellate 
court”).  Therefore, we hold that the circuit court’s conclusion 
that the 25% limit on attorney’s fees under HRS § 607-14 does 
not apply to the Ali‘ i Heights Subdivision is not binding on this 
court.  
  We thus look to the language of the statute in guiding 
our disposition.  The statute defines a “planned community 
association” as “a nonprofit homeowners or community association 
existing pursuant to covenants running with the land.”  HRS *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
17 
 § 607-14.  In Doran, the court concluded that the Kaanapali 
Hillside Homeowners’ Association was a planned community 
association under HRS § 607-14, noting that “employees of [the 
developers of the Kaanapali Hillside Subdivision,] filed a

1285, we apply the 25% cap to the appellate award only – as opposed to the aggregate of the trial and appellate awards.  
Rawsthorne did not argue that the ICA should aggregate the 
circuit court and ICA attorney’s fees awards when considering 
                     
11  Insofar as the circuit court erred in concluding that the 25% 
statutory cap on attorney’s fees did not apply, Rawsthorne’s decision not to 
challenge the circuit court’s attorney’s fees award precludes our review of 
that award.  As such, we decline to hold that the circuit court erred in 
awarding the Gailliards an attorney’s fees award in excess of 25% of the 
judgment.

 the 25% limit under HRS § 607-14 in her memo in opposition to 
the requested attorney’s fees filed in the ICA, nor did she 
raise it in her application for writ of certiorari. Rawsthorne 
cites Aloha Group for the first time in her reply in response to
the opposition to the application for writ of certiorari.12 
   
  Since Rawsthorne did not raise this argument until she filed her reply brief, and because review of the circuit court 
award is waived, we only consider the ICA award.  See Hawaii 
Ventures, LLC v. Otaka, Inc., 114 Hawai‘ i 438, 472 n.17, 164 P.3d 
696, 730 n.17 (2007) (“[Appellant’s] aforementioned point of error is deemed waived for failure to present any argument in 
its opening brief in the first instance and presenting such 
arguments in its reply brief to which no answer could be made.” 
(citation omitted)); Matter of Hawaiian Flour Mills, Inc., 76 
Hawai‘i 1, 14 n.5, 868 P.2d 419, 432 n.5 (1994) (holding that

12  Indeed, Rawsthorne’s memo in opposition to the Gailliards’ 
requested attorney’s fees on appeal argued that “Appellant objects to any 
award of attorney’s fees to Appellees over $10,000.”  (Emphasis added.)  
Stated another way, Rawsthorne was not arguing that HRS § 607-14 prohibited 
the ICA from awarding any attorney’s fees to the Gailliards.  Rather, 
Rawsthorne objected to any attorney’s fees on appeal that exceeded $10,000.00.  Similarly, her application for writ of certiorari contends that “[t]he ICA gravely erred by awarding attorney’s fees in the full amount 
requested by Respondents.”  (Emphasis added.)  In other words, Rawsthorne’s application did not argue that it was an error for the ICA to award the 
Gailliards any attorney’s fees, but that it was an error for the ICA to award 
the full amount requested by the Gailliards, which exceeded $10,000.00.  Both 
arguments thus implied that Rawsthorne believed it was an error for the ICA to grant appellate attorney’s fees over $10,000.00.  And neither argument 
implied that the appellate attorney’s fees award must be aggregated with the 
trial court’s attorney’s fees award. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 are deemed waived).  We thus conclude that the ICA could award 
the Gailliards no more than $10,000 plus excise tax on appeal, 
and thus erred by awarding $15,706.00 in attorney’s fees on 
appeal. 
 2.  The ICA did not abuse its discretion in awarding the  
  Gailliards attorney’s fees for the work for which they 
  requested compensation   
  Rawsthorne additionally claims that the Gailliards’ 
calculation of attorney’s fees includes items similar to clerical work we have previously determined was non-recoverable.  
See Schefke, 96 Hawai‘ i at 458, 32 P.3d at 102 (“Courts should 
reduce an award of attorney’s fees for . . . performance of 
clerical functions.”).  Specifically, Rawsthorne argues that the 
Gailliards’ request “includ[ed] [time] for drafting [t]ables and 
a certificate of service, and e-filing a brief.”  (Internal 
quotation marks omitted.)  However, HRS § 607-14 provides the 
court with discretion in determining what fees are reasonable.  
See HRS § 607-14 (“[I]n all actions on a promissory note or 
other contract in writing that provides for an attorney’s fee, there shall be taxed as attorneys’ fees, to be paid by the losing party. . . a fee that the court  determines to be 
reasonable[.]” (emphasis added)).  Because, as the Gailliards 
correctly suggest, “proofing and reducing a brief to bring it 
into compliance with court rules[ ] is an essential task by 
appellate counsel, and not a clerical function,” the ICA did not *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
20 
 abuse its discretion in determining that the fees for this work 
were recoverable.  (Internal quotations omitted.) 
B.  The ICA Correctly Affirmed the Circuit Court’s March 30, 
 2016 Order on the Merits 
 
  Turning to Rawsthorne’s remaining points on appeal 
related to the merits of the Gailliards’ breach of covenant 
claim, we conclude that the ICA did not err in affirming the 
circuit court’s Order and Final Judgment. 
 1.  Section 3.14 of the Covenant is not ambiguous.  
  
  Rawsthorne argues that the Covenant is similar to the 
covenant this court concluded was ambiguous in Hiner v. Hoffman, 
90 Hawai‘ i 188, 977 P.2d 878 (1999).  In Hiner, this court held 
that the “covenant at issue provid[ing] that ‘no dwelling shall 
be erected, altered, placed or permitted to remain . . . which 
exceeds two stories in height’” was ambiguous.  90 Hawai‘ i at 
190, 977 P.2d at 880 (brackets and emphasis omitted).  This 
court reasoned that without a “numerical measure[ment],” the 
covenant was ambiguous, leaving residents to guess what constituted a reasonable height.  Id.  Essentially, the phrase 
“two stories in height” was ambiguous because not all two-story homes are the same height; without a numerical measurement of 
what “exceeds” the permissible height limit, the covenant was 
unenforceable.  Thus, the Hiner covenant could be interpreted to 
permit a two-story home that was 40-feet in height to be built, *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
21 
 but not a three-story home that was 30-feet in height.  If the 
intent of the Hiner covenant - as the parties agreed - was to 
“establish concrete height restrictions,” id. at 191, 977 P.2d 
at 881, then the covenant failed to properly fulfill its 
purpose.   
  Rawsthorne thus contends that the phrase “reasonable height” is ambiguous without a specific numerical measurement.  
Unlike Hiner, in the instant case, a mechanical rule requiring 
that plants meet a specified numerical height would be 
ineffective in carrying out the intent of the Covenant.  For 
example, a fifteen-foot height limit might protect the view 
planes of some lots while not adequately protecting the view 
planes of others.  Additionally, a numerical height limit might 
have the adverse effect of allowing lot owners whose views are 
not impeded by their neighbors’ plants to nonetheless require the “offending” neighbors trim their plants merely for exceeding 
the limit.   
  Moreover, Rawsthorne’s argument that view planes require a definite and clear definition is no more persuasive as 
the view planes from one lot will differ from the view planes of 
another lot.  Therefore, the same concerns raised by the 
plaintiffs seeking enforcement of the Hiner covenant is not 
present here; the Covenant’s language clearly defines a “reasonable height” for plants as one that does “not [ ] *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
22 
 interfere with the view planes available to any other lot[.]”  
As such, the circuit court did not err in concluding that the 
Covenant was not ambiguous.    2.  The circuit court’s conclusion that Rawsthorne was in  
  violation of the Covenant is not clearly erroneous.   
  Likewise, we cannot say the circuit court’s conclusion 
that Rawsthorne was in violation of the Covenant was clearly 
erroneous.  In addition to citing testimony by two neighbors 
supporting the Gailliards’ claim that Rawsthorne’s plants 
violated the Covenant, the trial court’s FOFs also noted that:  
22.  The Court conducted a site visit after the conclusion 
of trial, to observe if the Defendants’ trees, shrubs, 
bushes, hedges and other plants are maintained “at a 
reasonable height so as not to interfere with the view 
planes available to any other lot[.]” 
 
(Emphasis added.)  
  The circuit court additionally took into consideration 
two pictures submitted by the Gailliards.  In light of the 
evidence in the record, we cannot say that the circuit court’s 
conclusion that Rawsthorne violated the Covenant is clearly erroneous. 
 3.  The circuit court did not err in awarding the   
  Gailliards diminution of value damages for a four-year 
  period.  
 
  “[T]he question for the appellate court under Rule 
52(a) is not whether it would have made the findings the trial 
court did . . . but whether it is left with a definite and firm 
conviction that a mistake has been made.”  Sandstrom v. Larsen, *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
23 
 59 Haw. 491, 495, 583 P.2d 971, 976 (1978) (citations omitted).  
In its FOFs, the circuit court found:  
23.  Plaintiffs testified regarding the impact that 
Defendants’ violation of Section 3.14 of the Declaration 
had on the value of their property. [ ] 
 
24.  Plaintiffs testified during their depositions in 
December 2015 that their property decreased in value by approximately $40,000. [ ] 
 
Additionally, the circuit court concluded in its COLs: 
11.  This court finds by a preponderance of the evidence, 
the Plaintiffs’ property value was diminished by $40,000 
for the period of Defendants’ breach of contract, 
specifically of Section 3.14 of the Declaration.   
 
  Although the court did not specifically note the 
period for which it was awarding the $40,000 damages award, the 
court’s FOFs make clear that it considered various evidence, 
including photographs from as early as November 2012, and 
testimony from multiple individuals.  Thus, the circuit court’s award of $40,000 in damages is not clearly erroneous so as to 
warrant “a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been 
made.”  Sandstrom, 59 Haw. at 495, 583 P.2d at 976.    
 4.  The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in  
  denying Rawsthorne’s motion for reconsideration.  
  
  In her motion for reconsideration, Rawsthorne raised 
two arguments: first, the circuit court did not identify any 
facts supporting its finding that the Gailliards had proven by a 
preponderance of the evidence that Rawsthorne violated the 
Covenant, and second, that the damages awarded to the Gailliards 
constituted impermissible double recovery.  Rawsthorne argued *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
24 
 that the first ground for reconsideration is based on the 
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, and “[t]he second 
ground . . . is based on the award issued” to the Gailliards for 
diminution in value.   
  A motion for reconsideration is limited to “allow[ing] 
the parties to present new evidence and/or arguments that could 
not have been presented during” trial and is “not a device to 
relitigate old matters or to raise arguments or evidence that could and should have been brought during the earlier 
proceeding.”  Wailea Elua, 100 Hawai‘ i at 110, 58 P.3d at 621 
(2002) (citation omitted).  Rawsthorne challenged the Order 
itself without presenting new evidence that she could not have 
presented at trial.  Although she argued that the evidence was 
not available because the Order did not exist at the time of 
trial, such an argument is unpersuasive.  Rawsthorne knew that 
the Gailliards sought both a permanent injunction and money 
damages.  And, at the Gailliards’ depositions, both Jodi and John Gailliard testified that the value of their property 
decreased by approximately $40,000.00 due to Rawsthorne’s plants obstructing their view.  Thus, Rawsthorne knew or should have 
known that the Gailliards sought diminution in value damages of 
at least $40,000.00.  Moreover, Rawsthorne could have disputed 
the Gailliards’ evidence supporting their request for $40,000.00 
in damages at trial.  Rawsthorne’s contention that she did not *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 know the circuit court would have awarded the Gailliards $40,000.00 in damages is thus unpersuasive and the circuit 
court’s denial of Rawsthorne’s motion for reconsideration was 
not an abuse of discretion.    
V. CONCLUSION 
  For the foregoing reasons, we vacate in part the ICA’s 
September 29, 2020 judgment on appeal awarding the Gailliards 
$15,706.00 in appellate attorney’s fees and remand to the ICA for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  We 
otherwise affirm the ICA’s judgment on appeal. Patrick K. Wong and
