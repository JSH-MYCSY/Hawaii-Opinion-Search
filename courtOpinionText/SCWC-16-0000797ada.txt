2 granting Lee’s motion to suppress evidence obtained in a search 
of Lee’s  bedroom.  On certiorari, Lee raises a single point of 
error and argues that the ICA erred in applying an emergency aid 
exception, which Lee contends is inconsistent with article I, 
section 7 of the Hawaiʻi Constitution.  
Even if the police officers unlawfu lly searched Lee’s 
bedroom, however, the circuit court erred in suppressing all  
evidence obtained by the State .  The evidence did not constitute 
suppressible “fruit of the poisonous tree.”  The State did not 
gain any benefit from the police officers’ entry into Lee’s 
bedroom.  Moreover, Lee’s actions following the officers’ entry 
into Lee’s bedroom severed any causal link between the officers’ 
purportedly unlawful entry and the evidence recovered.  
Therefore, the ICA did not err in  vacating  the Order entered by 
the circuit court on October 13, 2016, and we affirm the ICA’s 
Judgment on Appeal on different grounds.  
I. Background  
A. Factual Background  
On October 26, 2015, Honolulu Police Department (HPD) 
dispatched Corporal Craig3 Takahashi (Corporal Takahashi), 
                     
3  The record identifies Corporal Takahashi as both “Kurt Takahashi” an d 
“Craig Takahashi.”  This court will use the given name Corporal Takahashi 
provided in his own testimony.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
3 Officer S ommer4 Kahao (Officer Kahao), and Sergeant Michael Cobb 
(Sergeant Cobb) (collectively, the officers) to respond to a 
“suicidal male call” at a home in ʻAiea.  The dispatcher informed 
the officers that Lee had locke d himself in his bedroom, where 
he kept samurai swords , and was threatening suicide.  
After the officers entered the home with Lee’s 
family’s consent , the officers attempted to persuade Lee to open 
the door so that they could visually confirm that Lee was 
unharmed, as required by HPD training.  Officer Kahao spoke with 
Lee first, using phrases like “Joshua, this is Officer Kahao, 
Could you please open the door?”  Instead of opening the door, 
Lee responded that he was okay and that the officers should 
leave.  After Officer Kahao spoke with Lee for approximately ten 
minutes, Sergeant Cobb took over speaking with Lee.  The circuit 
court found that “S ergeant Cobb was more demanding ” and told Lee 
that he “needed to grow up” and “ to be a man.”  When Lee asked 
if the officers had a warrant, Sergeant Cobb responded, “We 
don’t need a warrant, dumbass.”5 
Despite Lee’s requests  that the officers leave , the 
officers were required to ensure that Lee was neither harmed nor 
                     
4  The record identifies Officer Kahao as both “Sommer Kahao” and “Summer 
Kahao.”  This court will use the spelling utilized in the indictment . 
 
5  Sergeant Cobb testified that using aggressive language in response to 
suicide calls is permitted by HPD training.  This court expresses no opinion 
on the propriety of Sergeant Cobb’s  methods.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
4 at imminent risk of injuring himself.  Sergeant Cob b therefore 
picked the lock on the door  so that the officers could at least 
see Lee.  However, Sergeant Cobb could not open the door be cause 
it was being obstructed . 
Once the door opened,  however,  the situation rapidly 
changed.  Lee opened the door approxi mately four to six inches.  
From the hallway, the officers saw Lee holding a sword handle in 
his right hand.  Based on the officers’ positioning, Sergeant 
Cobb could only see the sword handle.  However, Officer Kahao 
and Corporal Takahashi both saw that th e sword was made of wood.  
Officer Kahao instructed Lee to drop the sword, but Lee did not 
immediately comply.  
Concerned for the officers’ safety, Sergeant Cobb 
pushed open the door and entered the room, simultaneously 
pushing Lee away from the officers.  Once Sergeant Cobb was 
inside the room , Lee swung the sword at Sergeant Cobb, but 
missed.  Sergeant Cobb attempted to calm Lee down, but Lee 
maintained an aggressive stance.  Sergeant Cobb tried to grab 
Lee’s arm.  However, Lee flipped Sergeant Cobb onto Sergeant 
Cobb’s back.  Lee then started kneeing Sergeant Cobb in the 
head.  From the time Lee opened the door to the time Lee flipped 
Sergeant Cobb over, mere seconds had passed.  
After seeing Sergeant Cobb suddenl y flip over, Officer 
Kahao attempted to grab Lee  from behind .  However, Lee threw ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
5 Officer Kahao onto a couch in the room.  Officer Kahao and 
Corporal Takahashi ultimately  subdued Lee using pepper spray.   
A grand jury indicted Lee with Terroristic Threaten ing 
in the First Degree,6 Assault Against a Law Enforcement Officer 
in the First Degree,7 and Resisting Arrest.8 
                     
6  Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) §  707-716(1) (2013) provides in relevant 
part 
 
Terroristic threatening in the first degree .  (1) A 
person commits the offense of terroristic threatening in 
the first degree if the person commits terroristic 
threatening:  
 
. . . 
 
(c)  Against a public servant arising ou t of the 
performance of the public servant’s official duties.

. . . 
 
(e)  With the use of a dangerous instrument or a

(a) Intentionally or knowingly causes bodily injury to a 
law enforcement officer who is engaged in the 
performance of duty[.]

arrest by : 
 
(a) Using or threatening to use physical force against 
the law enforcement officer or another[.]  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
6 B. Circuit Court Proceedings  
Lee moved the circuit court to suppress all evidence 
gathered from Lee’s bedroom, all statements made to the officers  
after they entered Lee’s room, and “all actions initiated by 
illegal observations made by HPD Officers.”  Lee asserted that 
he possessed a reasonable expectation of privacy in his bedroom 
and that any evidence of his actions was obtained from a 
warrantles s search.  
The circuit court granted Lee’s motion.  In 
particular, the circuit court determined that Lee possessed a 
reasonable expectation of privacy in his bedroom, that Sergeant 
Cobb coerced Lee into opening his bedroom door, and that “all 
statements, ev idence, observations and actions that were 
observed or obtained” after entry into Lee’s bedroom should be 
suppressed.  
C. ICA Proceedings  
The State appealed to the ICA, arguing that the 
circuit court erred in granting Lee’s motion to suppress because 
(1) the exigent circumstances exception applied, (2)  the federal 
emergency aid exception applied, and (3)  alternatively, if the 
officers unlawfully entered Lee’s room, Lee’s actions were not 
protected as they constituted a new crime.  
The ICA agreed with the State ’s claim that an 
emergency aid exception applied .  Notably, the ICA determined ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
7 that a warrantless search occurred when Lee opened his bedroom 
door.  Nevertheless, the ICA held that the search was reasonable 
because an emergency aid exception justified the wa rrantless 
search, and the circuit court therefore erred in granting Lee’s 
motion to suppress.  
II. Standard of Review  
A. Motion to Suppress  
“[W]e review questions of constitutional law under the 
‘right/wrong ’ standard. ”  State v. Jenkins , 93 Hawaiʻi 87, 100, 
997 P.2d 13, 26 (2000) (citing State v. Toyomura , 80 Hawaiʻi 8, 
15, 904 P.2d 893, 900 (1995)).  Accordingly, “[w]e review the 
circuit court’s ruling on a motion to suppress de novo to 
determine whether the ruling was ‘right’ or ‘wrong.’”  State v. 
Kauhi, 86 Hawaiʻi 195, 197, 948 P.2d 1036, 1038 (1997) (citing 
State v. Navas , 81 Hawaiʻi 113, 123, 913 P.2d 39, 49 (1996)).  
III.  Discussion  
On certiorari, Lee argues that the ICA erred in 
vacating  the circuit court’s order granting Lee’s motion to 
suppress evidence.  Sp ecifically, Lee contends that “the State 
. . . failed to establish exigent circumstances to justify the 
warrantless search.”  Lee adds that the ICA improperly relied 
upon the federal emergency aid exception because it  “is 
inconsistent with the enhanced pro tections afforded under 
Article I, Section 7” of the Hawaiʻi Constitution.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
8 We accepted certiorari in this case to reinforce our 
precedent regarding the exclusionary rule and the fruit of the 
poisonous tree doctrine.  Assuming that the officers’ entry int o 
Lee’s bedroom was unlawful, the State bore the burden of showing 
that the evidence gathered was not tainted by their unlawful 
entry.  The State satisfied this burden.  The officers did not 
receive any benefit from entering Lee’s bedroom.  Additionally , 
Lee’s decision to assault the officers constituted  an 
intervening circumstance which dissipated the causal link 
between the officers’ entry and the evidence gathered.  Because 
the evidence at issue did not constitute fruit of the poisonous 
tree regardless o f the legality of the officers’ entry, we do 
not address the issue of whether the emergency aid exception 
justified the officers’ entry.  
A. The Exclusionary Rule and the Fruit of the Poisonous Tree 
Doctrine.  
The Hawaiʻi exclusionary rule serves the dual purposes 
“of deterring governmental officials from circumventing the 
protections afforded by the Hawaiʻi Constitution” and of 
“protect[ing] the privacy rights of our citizens.”  State v. 
Lopez, 78 Hawaiʻi 433, 446, 896 P.2d 889, 902 (1995) (citing 
State v.  Furuyama , 64 Haw. 109, 122, 637 P.2d 1095, 1104 
(1981)).  Relatedly, “the ‘fruit of the poisonous tree’ doctrine 
‘prohibits the use of evidence at trial which comes to light as ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
9 a result of the exploitation of a previous illegal act of the 
police.’”  State v. Fukusaku , 85 Hawaiʻi 462, 475, 946 P.2d 32, 
45 (1997 ). 
B. The circuit court erred in granting Lee’s motion to 
suppress  because there was no fruit of the poisonous tree.  
Under the federal constitution, i n order to prevent 
evidence from being suppresse d as “fruit of the poisonous tree,” 
the prosecution must “show that its evidence is untainted” by 
the government’s purportedly unlawful act.  Id.  The State may 
achieve this goal either by showing that the police did not 
exploit the illegal activity to gat her evidence, id., or by 
demonstrating that there is no causal link between the illegal 
activity and the evidence gathered, Wong Sun v. United States , 
371 U.S. 471, 488, 83 S. Ct. 407, 417 (1963).  We have adopted a 
similar formulat ion under the state cons titution:  
“[T]he ‘fruit of the poisonous tree ’ doctrine ‘prohibits 
the use of evidence at trial which comes to light as a 
result of the exploitation of a previous illegal act of the 
police.’”  State v. Fukusaku , 85 Hawai‘i 462, 475, 946 P.2d 
32, 45 (1997) (quoting  State v. Medeiros , 4 Haw.  App. 248, 
251 n.4, 665 P.2d 181, 184 n.4 (1983)).  “Under the fruit 
of the poisonous tree doctrine, [a]dmissibility is 
determined by ascertaining whether the evidence objected to 
as being ‘fruit’ was discovered or became known by the 
exploitation of the prior illegality or by other means 
sufficiently distinguished as to purge the later evidence 
of the initial taint.”   State v. Poaipuni , 98 Hawai‘i 387, 
392–93, 49 P.3d 353, 358 –59 (2002) (alteratio n in original) 
(quoting  Fukusaku , 85 Hawai‘i at 475, 946 P.2d at 45).  
State v. Trinque , 140 Hawaiʻi 269, 281, 400 P.3d 470, 482 (2017) . 
 
Here, both  exceptions to the “fruit of the poisonous 
tree” doctrine apply . ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
10 1. The State did not obtain any benefit from opening 
Lee’s bedroom door.  
As previously stated, one of the purposes of the 
Hawaiʻi exclusionary rule is to deter the circumvention of the 
Hawaiʻi Constitution’s protections.  Lopez, 78 Hawaiʻi at 446, 
896 P.2d at 902.  Thus, this court has explained that  evidence 
may be excluded where “the State [is] unable to meet its burden 
of showing that the discovery of the challenged evidence was not 
a benefit derived from the prior illegality.”  Trinque, 140 
Hawaiʻi at 282, 400 P.3d at 483 (emphasis added).  
Opening Lee’s bedroom door did not confer any benefit 
upon the officers or the State.  Notably, the officers were not 
summoned to Lee’s home for the purpose of conducting a criminal 
investigation.  Rather, the officers were responding to a 
“suicidal male call.”  Assuming arguendo  that the officers 
unlawfully opened Lee’s bedroom door, they did not do so for the 
purpose of gathering evidence, but to administer care .  The 
officers did not gain any benefit from opening Lee’s bedroom 
door or exploit that illegal entry  to procure the relevant 
evidence – their observations of Lee’s actions – because the 
entry did not lead the officers to search for that evidence nor 
direct any investigation into its discovery .  Consequently, any 
evidence obtained cannot be suppressed on the basis that the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
11 State derived a benefit from the prior illegality.  See Trinque, 
140 Hawaiʻi at 282, 400 P.3d at 483.  
2. Lee’s independent actions purged any potential taint 
from the officers’ allegedly unlawful entry.  
In addition to the fact that the poli ce did not derive 
any benefit from opening Lee’s bedroom door, Lee’s independent 
actions purged any taint from the officers’ entry.  In its brief 
before the ICA, the State argued that the exclusionary rule  does 
not exclude “testimony describing [Lee’s] own  illegal actions 
following an unlawful search and seizure.”  We agree.  
The State primarily relied upon United States v. 
Waupekenay , 973 F.2d 1533 (10th Cir. 1992), to assert that Lee 
had no reasonable expectation of privacy once the officers 
entered his be droom, and thus , evidence of Lee’s actions did not 
constitute fruit of the poisonous tree.  In Waupekenay , the 
United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit noted that 
state and federal courts have relied upon  three rationales for 
allowing prosecutors to utilize evidence of new crimes committed 
by defendants after illegal government intrusions.   Id. at 1537-
38.  First, some courts have held, as the Tenth Circuit did in 
Waupekenay , that defendants “could not hav e had a reasonable 
expectation of privacy for any actions initiated subsequently  to 
[the government agents’ unlawful entry] in their presence.”  Id. 
at 1537.  Second, a number of courts have instead held that “the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
12 intervening act of the defendant [is] so s eparate and distinct 
from the illegal entry or arrest as to break the causal chain. ”  
Id. at 1538.  Third, other courts have focused on “the limited 
objective of the exclusionary rule .  . . and the strong public 
interest in preventing and punishing force o r threats of force 
directed against police officers.”  Id. 
The Tenth Circuit explained that “[t]he rationale that 
is most applicable depends upon the underlying facts of the 
encounter.”   Id.  However, the Tenth Circuit noted, “whatever 
rationale is used, t he result is the same: Evidence of a 
separate, independent crime initiated against police officers in 
their presence after an illegal entry or arrest will not be 
suppressed under the Fourth Amendment.”  Id. at 1538.  
Although we disagree wi th the Tenth Circ uit’s 
determination regarding a defendant’s expectation of privacy , we 
agree that evidence of a separate, independent crime after an 
illegal entry will not be suppressed under  either the Fourth 
Amendment  of the United States Constitution or article I, 
section 7 of the Hawaiʻi Constitution .  By the Waupekenay  court’s 
logic, a defendant would lack a reasonable expectation of 
privacy in a home for any action initiated  in the presence of 
government agents  after the government agents unlawfully entered 
the home.   See id. at 1537.   Such an exception would swallow the 
rule.  Neither the Fourth Amendment of the United States ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
13 Constitution nor article I, section 7 of the Hawaiʻi Constitution 
would deter government intrusions into the privacy of an 
individual’s home so long as government agents could conceivably  
identify  a newly initiated action  following an illegal entry . 
The Waupekenay  court attempt ed to rectify this issue 
by explaining that the individual would still have an 
expectation of privacy in any pre -existing activities as well as 
any acts that are “extension[s] of the previously initiated 
illegal activity.”  Id.9  However, this leads to a questionable 
exercise in line drawing between pre -existing and newly 
initiated activities.  Notably, the Waupekenay  court provided, 
as an example, that if an individual was cultivating marijuana 
in his living room prior to the unlawful government intrusion, 
the police would not be allo wed seize the pre -existing 
contraband.   Id.  The Waupekenay  court added that “an effort to 
dispose of preexisting contraband following an illegal entry 
does not validate the seizure of the contraband because the 
disposal effort is viewed not as a new or in dependent criminal 
act but rather as an extension of the previously initiated 
illegal activity.”  Id.  On the one hand , the disposal of the 
                     
9  The Tenth Circuit appears to base this reasoning on the  United States 
Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit’s articulation of a “new crime ” 
exception.  See United States v. Bailey , 691 F.2d 1009 (11th Cir. 1982).   
However, as discussed infra, this is problematic because  it is not 
necessarily clear where the line between a pre -existing crime and a new crime 
should be drawn.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
14 evidence of a previous crime is inextricably linked to the 
previous crime itself , and could therefore be considered an 
extension of the past criminal activity .  However, it is not 
clear why such a connection alone neutralizes the fact that 
disposal of evidence is a distinct crime.  Compare 21 U.S.C. 
§ 841(a)(1)  (making it unlawful to  knowingly or intentional ly 
manufactu re, distribute , or dispense , possess  with the intent to 
manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance ), 
with 18 U.S.C. §  2232(a) (criminalizing the “[d]estruction or 
removal of property to prevent seizure”).   Thus, we disagree 
with the Tenth Circuit’s reasoning that an individual lacks a 
reasonable expectation of privacy for actions initiated in the 
presence of police officers  who unlawfully entered the 
individual’s home . 
Instead, this court finds persuasive our sister 
courts’ reasoning that defendants ’ subsequent criminal act s, 
committed of their own free will, sever the causal link between 
the illegal entry and the evidence.   See, e.g. , State v. 
Saavedra , 396 N.W.2d 304, 305 (N.D. 1986); State v. Bale , 267 
N.W.2d 730, 732 -33 (Minn. 1978); People v. Townes , 359 N.E.2d 
402, 406 (N.Y. 1976) .  The causal connection between the State’s 
unlawful activity and the discovery of the challenged evidence 
obtained “may .  . . become so attenuated as to dissipate the 
taint.”  Nardone v. United States , 308 U.S. 338, 341, 60 S. Ct. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
15 266, 268 (1939).  Thus, “the more apt question [here] is 
‘whether, granting establishment of the primary illegality, the 
evidence to which instant objection is made has been come at 
. . . by means s ufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the 
primary taint.’”  Wong Sun , 371 U.S. at 488, 83 S. Ct. at 417 
(quoting Maguire, Evidence of Guilt , 221 (1959) ). 
The Minnesota Supreme Court has posited that 
“[n]umerous factors bear on the application of this  test, 
including the temporal proximity of the illegality and the fruit 
of that illegality, the presence of intervening circumstances, 
and the purpose and flagrancy of the physical misconduct.”  
Bale, 267 N.W.2d at 733.  The Bale court emphasized that the 
“last factor is especially important, because the aim of the 
exclusionary rule is to deter police misconduct by removing the 
incentive to disregard constitutional guarantees.”  Id.  We 
agree. 
The factors identified by the Bale court militate 
against granti ng Lee’s motion to suppress.  Based on the record 
before this court,  Lee committed two intervening acts that 
severed the causal chain between the officers’ entry and the 
resulting evidence.  First, after speaking with the officers 
through his bedroom door for approximately twenty minutes, Lee ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
16 opened his bedroom door while holding a wooden sword in a 
threatening manner.10  Second, once the officers entered the 
room, Lee attempted to strike Sergeant Cobb with the sword.  
Each of these acts was sufficient to tr ansform the welfare check  
into an exigent circumstance.  
Furthermore, the officers merely sought to ensure that 
Lee was unharmed, and therefore had no interest in gathering 
evidence to support a criminal investigation.  See also Bale, 
267 N.W.2d at 733 (“More important is the fact that no intent to 
secure evidence motivated the decision to custodially arrest 
defendant on the misdemeanor charge.”).  Consequently, any 
evidence obtained by the State was collected “by means 
sufficiently d istinguishable to be purged of the primary taint,” 
Wong Sun , 371 U.S. at 488, 83 S. Ct. at 417, because any search 
of Lee’s room was neither purposeful nor sufficiently flagrant 
to merit suppressing the  evidence found, see Bale, 267 N.W.2d at 
733. 
                     
10  The Dissent asserts that the officers should have left once Lee’s 
brother withdrew his consent for the officers to be in the home.  Assuming 
Lee’s brother actually withdrew his consent, the withdrawal was legally 
irrelevant because Lee had already committed an intervening act.  
 
 The Dissent also argues that there is evidence in the record that this 
“was not actually an intervening act because Lee was not holding the wooden 
sword in a threatening manner.”  Respectfully, no such evidence appears in 
the record.  At the time Lee opened his  door, Lee’s brother was sitting in 
the dining room.  Lee’s brother did not testify that he could see into the 
room from where he sat.  Instead, Lee’s brother testified that he only saw 
Lee after the officers had entered Lee’s room.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

/s/ Sabrina S. McKenna IV. Conclusi on 
For the foregoing reasons, the circuit court erred in 
suppressing the evidence of Lee’s intervening and independent 
assault against the officers.  Crucially, this opinion does not 
legalize the State’s intrusion into the privacy of an 
individual’s bedro om.  Rather, it merely allows the State to 
offer evidence resulting from a person’s own unlawful actions 
following the entry.  Because the evidence should not have been 
suppressed even if t he officers  unlawfully entered Lee’s 
bedroom, we do not address the issue of whether an emergency aid 
exception justified the search .  We therefore affirm the ICA’s 
July 2, 2019 Judgment on Appeal on different grounds .
