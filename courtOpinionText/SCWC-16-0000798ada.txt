OPINION OF THE COURT BY NAKAYAMA, J.  
 
This appeal calls upon the court to clarify when 
multiple offenses arise from the same criminal episode.  As this 
court has articulated, the test for determining the singleness 
of a criminal episode is based on whether the alleged conduct 
was so closely re lated in time, place, and circumstances that a Electronically Filed

2 complete account of one charge cannot be related without 
referring to details of the other charge.   In order for multiple 
offenses to satisfy the circumstances element of the single -
episode test, the alleged o ffenses must raise similar fact s 
and/or issues such that there is a substantive overlap in 
evidence between the offenses . 
Applying these criteria to the case before us, the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) correctly determined that 
Hawaiʻi law does not require the joinder of Petitioner /Defendant -
Appellee Bronson Sardinha’s traffic offenses with his assault 
offense.  We therefore affirm the ICA’s Judgment  on Appeal . 
I. BACKGROUND  
A. Factual Background  
1. The Traffic Offenses1 
On November 28, 2015, th e Honolulu Police Department 
(HPD) dispatched Officer Crystal D. Roe (Officer Roe) to a 
“Motor Vehicle Collision Fled Scene”  incident around 10:50 P.M. 
at the intersection of Farrington Highway and Waipiʻo Point 
Access Road in Waipahu.  The fleeing vehicle  had struck another 
                     
1  Pursuant to Hawaiʻi Rules of Evidence Rule 201(c)  (1980), this court 
takes judicial notice of the proceedings in the District Court of the First 
Circuit in case number 1DTC-15-071381.  Judicial notice is appropriate 
because the proceedings are a significant  component of the present inquiry.

3 vehicle and purportedly bore Hawaiʻi license plate “GRA -505.”  
These events constitute the “Traffic Offenses.”  
After discovering the fleeing vehicle later that 
night, HPD cited Sardinha for  (1) driving a motor vehicle 
without a valid dr iver’s license,  in violation of Hawaiʻi Revised 
Statutes (HRS) §  286-102;2 (2) driving a motor vehicle while his 
license was revoked,  in violation of HRS §  286-132;3 
(3) inattention to driving,  in violation of HRS §  291-12;4

5 possessing a motor vehicle in surance policy , in violation of 
HRS § 431:10C-104.7 
On December 28, 2015, Respondent/Plaintiff -Appellant 
State of Hawaiʻi (the State) charged Sardinha by complaint with 
four of the cited offenses.  Between December 28, 2015 and March 
8, 2016, the State dismissed all of the charges except for the 
inattention to driving charge , and Sardinha agreed to enter a no 
contest plea on the inattention to driving charge.  The District 
Court of the First Circuit  filed a Notice of Entry of Judgment 
and/or Order and Pl ea/Judgment accepting Sardinha’s no contest 
plea on March  8, 2016.  
2. The Assault Offense 
Around 11:50 P.M. on November 28, 2015, HPD dispatched 
Officers Jon M. Nguyen (Officer Nguyen) and Shayne Sesoko 
(Officer Sesoko) to a reported argument at Nancy’s Kitch en in 
the Waipiʻo Shopping Center.   Upon arriving at Nancy’s Kitchen, 
Officers Nguyen and Sesoko determined that a male (later 
                     
(4) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per one 
hundred milliliters or cubic centimeters of 
blood. 
7  HRS § 431:10C-104(a) (2005) provides:  
 
Except as provided in section 431:10C -105, no person 
shall operate o r use a motor vehicle upon any public 
street, road, or highway of this State at any time unless 
such motor vehicle is insured at all times under a motor 
vehicle insurance policy.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
6 identified as Sardinha) and a female were the parties to the 
argument.  Although the argument had ended by  the time the 
officers arrived, the officers remained at Nancy’s Kitchen while 
the female waited  inside for her mother to pick her up.  
As the officers waited, Sardinha  remained outside  of 
the establishment with the officers and  swore at the officers.  
Sardinha eventually walked to and got into the driver’s seat of 
a white SUV with Hawaiʻi license plate “GRA -505.”  The officers 
noticed that the vehicle had front -end damage and had the same 
license plate as the vehicle involved in the Traffic Offenses .  
Upon recognizing the vehicle , Officer Sesoko informed Sardinha 
that the vehicle had been involved in a hit-and-run.  Sardinha 
responded that the SUV was not his and that he had no t been 
sitting in the vehicle.  Sardinha also continued  denigrating the 
officers and challenged Officer N guyen to fight.  
Around 12:30 A.M. on November 29, 2015, HPD also 
dispatched Officer Roe to Nancy’s Kitchen.  Sardinha recognized 
Officer Roe from an unrelated October 31, 2015 incident, and 
briefly complied with Officer Roe’s request for his personal 
identification.  However, Sardinha continued acting aggressively 
towards Officers Nguyen and Sesoko.  
After receiving Sardinha’s personal identification, 
the officers ran a warrant check on Sardinha.  HPD dispatch *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
7  informed the officers that Sardinha had a possib le contempt 
warrant.  The officers detained Sardinha because of the possible 
warrant and attempted to place him in a squad car while they 
waited for confirmation of the warrant.   However, Sardinha  
refused to cooperate and headbutted the right side of Officer 
Sesoko’s face.  The officers subsequently arrested Sardinha for 
assaulting a law enforcement officer.  These events constitute 
the “Assault Offense.”  
On March 8, 2016, a grand jury indicted Sar dinha for 
Assault Against a Law Enforcement Officer in the First Degree , 
in violation of HRS §  707-712.5(1)(a),8 in the Circuit Court of 
the First Circuit (circuit court) . 
B. Circuit Court Motion to Dismiss9 
On August 29, 2016, Sardinha filed a Motion for 
Dismissal with Prejudice Pursuant to HRS §  701-111 and § 701-
109.  According to Sardinha, HRS §  701-10910 required the State 
                     
8  HRS § 707-712.5(1)(a) (2014)  provides:  
 
Assault against a law enforcement officer in the first 
degree.  (1) A person commits the offense of assault 
against a law enforcement officer in the first degree if 
the person:  
 
(a) Intentionally or knowingly causes bodily injury to 
a law enforcement officer who is engaged in the 
performance o f duty[.]  
9  The Honorable Glenn J. Kim presided.  
 
10  HRS § 701-109 (2014) provides in relevant part:  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
8 to try the Traffic Offenses and the Assault Offense together 
because the offenses arose from a single criminal episode.  
Citing State v. Keliiheleua , 105 Hawaiʻi 174, 181, 95 P.3d 605, 
612 (2004), Sardinha pointed out that the applicable test for 
determining whether multiple offenses arise from the same 
episode is “whether the alleged conduct was so closely related 
in time, place and circ umstances that a complete account of one 
charge cannot be related without referring to details of the 
other charge.”  Sardinha reasoned that any trial for the Assault 
Offense would necessarily involve details of the Traffic 
Offenses because (1)  the officer s referenced the Traffic 
Offenses in their reports for the Assault Offense, and 
(2) Officer Sesoko triggered Sardinha by mentioning that 
Sardinha’s vehicle was in a hit -and-run. 
The circuit court heard Sardinha’s motion to dismiss 
on September 28, 2016.  D uring the hearing, Sardinha emphasized 
                     
(2) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this 
section, a defendant shall not be subject to separate 
trials for multiple offenses based on the same conduct or 
arising from the same episode, if such offenses are known 
to the appropriate prosecuting officer at the time of the 
commencement of the first trial and are within the 
jurisdiction of a single court.  
 
(3) When a defendant is charged with two or m ore 
offenses based on the same conduct or arising from the same 
episode, the court, on application of the prosecuting 
attorney or of the defendant, may order any such charge to 
be tried separately, if it is satisfied that justice so 
requires.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
9 that a key issue for the circuit court to consider was the 
timing of the two cases.  Sardinha noted that even though the 
State “could try the [Traffic Offenses] case without mentioning 
the [Assault Offense] case,” it “cannot give a complete 
accounting of the [Assault Offense] case without mentioning the 
[Traffic Offenses] case.”  
The circuit court granted Sardinha’s motion, 
explaining that it did not “see how a complete account of the 
[Assault Offense] could be given wi thout referring to the 
details of the [Traffic Offenses].”  In particular, the circuit 
court reasoned  that even though the State could completely avoid 
discussing the Traffic Offenses, Sardinha would still be 
entitled to cross -examine the officers regardin g the Traffic 
Offenses.  
C. ICA Proceedings  
The State appealed the circuit court’s order granting 
Sardinha’s motion to dismiss to the ICA.  
On appeal, the State argued that “ although it does not 
appear that the time and place factors are dependent on any 
bright-line time limit or distance between the multiple 
offenses, it appears that resolution of these factors is instead 
dependent on the circumstances that allegedly bind the multiple 
offenses [.]”  Citing State v. Akau , 118 Hawaiʻi 44, 57, 185 P.3d *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
10 229, 242 (2008), the State asserted that one of the key factors 
in determining whether multiple offenses are closely related is 
if one offense provides probable cause to suspect the defendant 
of committing the other.  According to the State, however, the 
underlying  facts of the Traffic Offenses  did not provide the 
officers with probable cause to suspect Sardinha of committing  
the Assault Offense . 
The State further claimed that the Traffic Offenses 
were not related to the Assault Offense because “[t]he facts and 
issues involved in the [Traffic Offenses case] are completely 
different from the facts and issues presented in the Assault 
[Offense] charge.”  Specifically, the relevant statutes raise 
distinct dispositive issues such that the witnesses to be used 
and the evid ence to be offered would not significantly overlap.  
Responding to the State’s probable cause argument, 
Sardinha asserted that the facts of the Assault Offense actually 
provided the officers with probable cause to suspect Sardinha 
for the Traffic Offenses.  Sardinha also reiterated the points 
he made to the circuit court.  
On January 15, 2021, the ICA ruled in a memorandum 
opinion that the Traffic Offenses and the Assault Offense were 
not so closely related in time, place, or circumstance s that 
HRS § 701-109(2) compelled the joinder of the two proceedings.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
11 In particular, the ICA noted that “[t]here is nothing in the 
record to indicate that the charges both entailed the same 
witnesses, or that any overlap in the evidence would occur, 
militating in favor of joi nder.”  Moreover,  
In concluding that the offenses therein did not share 
similar circumstances, the Keliiheleua  Court also pointed 
to the dissimilarity of “the statutory requirements of the 
alleged offenses[.]”  [105 Hawaiʻi at 182, 95 P.3d at 613.]  
Here, the statutory requirements of the Inattention to 
Driving Charge, and the Assault Against [Law Enforcement 
Officer] charge, are dissimilar.  There is no overlap in 
the elements that the State must prove for the [Traffic 
Offenses] or the [Assault Offense].  
(First alteration in original;  footnotes omitted.)  
Addressing the State’s probable cause argument, the 
ICA quoted State v. Maganis , 109 Hawaiʻi 84, 86, 123 P.3d 679, 
681 (2005), for the premise that  
[p]robable cause exists when the facts and circumstances 
within one’s knowledge and of which one has reasonabl e 
trustworthy information are sufficient in themselves to 
warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe that an 
offense has been committed.  This requir es more than a mere 
suspicion but less than a certainty.  
However,  the ICA concluded  that “the facts and circumstances of 
the [Traffic Offenses] did not provide sufficient probable cause 
to suspect that Sardinha would subsequently head -butt Office r 
Sesoko, leading to the [Assault Offense].”  T he ICA further 
concluded that the Assault Offense did not provide the officers 
with probable cause to suspect Sardinha for the Traffic Offenses 
because “the record does not reflect how or when Sardinha was *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
12 identified as  the driver in the [Traffic Offenses].”  The ICA 
therefore vacated the circuit court’s order.  
This application for writ of certiorari followed.  
II. STANDARD S OF REVIEW  
A. Motion to Dismiss Indictment  
A trial court’s decision to dismiss an indictment is 
reviewed f or an abuse of discretion.  State v. Chong , 86 Hawaiʻi 
282, 287 -88 n.2, 949 P.2d 122, 127 -28 n.2 (1997).  “An abuse of 
discretion occurs ‘where the trial court has clearly exceeded 
the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles of law 
or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant.’”  
Carr v. Strode , 79 Hawaiʻi 475, 488, 904 P.2d 489, 50 2 (1995) 
(quoting Amfac, Inc. v. Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co. , 74 Haw. 
85, 114, 839 P.2d 10, 26 (1992)).  
B. Statutory Interpretation  
“The interpretation of a statute is a question of law 
which this court reviews de novo.”  Keep the N. Shore Country v. 
Bd. Of Land & Nat. Res. , 150 Hawaiʻi 486, 503, 506 P.3d 150, 167 
(2022) (citing State v. Ruggiero , 114 Hawai‘i 227, 231, 160 P.3d 
703, 707 (2007) ). 
III.   DISCUSSION  
On certiorari, Sardinha reiterates his assertion that 
the Traffic Offenses and the Assault Offense are so closely *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
13 related in time, place, and circumstance s that they arose from a 
single episode.  Seizing upon the State’s analysis of Akau, 
Sardinha goes one step further to assert that if the Assault 
Offense provided probable cause for the officers to suspect 
Sardinha for the Traffic Offenses, then the circumstances 
element of the single -episode test is satisfied.  Sardinha 
additionally repeats his  claim that “it would be impossible to 
give a complete account of the facts of the [Assault Offense] 
without mentioning the [Traffic Offenses].”  
However, Akau’s reliance on probable cause to satisfy 
the circumstances element of the single -episode test is f lawed.  
Treating the existence of probable cause as a dispositive factor 
improperly cuts short the single -episode test’s  requirement to 
consider whether “a complete account of one charge cannot be 
related without referring to details of the other charge.”  
State v. Carroll , 63 Haw. 345, 351, 627 P.2d 776, 780 (1981).  
An analysis of the statutory requirements of the alleged 
offenses as well as the underlying facts illustrates that there 
is negligible overlap between  the Traffic Offenses and the 
Assault Offe nse.  Additionally, the mere fact that Sardinha may 
cross-examine the officers regarding their knowledge of the 
Traffic Offenses during a trial for the Assault Offense does not *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
14 establish that the Assault Offense cannot be tried without 
reference to the Tra ffic Offenses.  
A. The requirements of HRS §  701-109(2) and the single -episode 
test. 
Pursuant to HRS § 701-109(2),  
a defendant shall not be subject to separate trials for 
multiple offenses based on the same conduct or arising from 
the same episode, if such offenses are known to the 
appropriate prosecuting officer at the time of the 
commencement of the first trial and are within the 
jurisdiction of a single court.  
This rule “reflect[s] a policy that defendants should 
not have to face the expense and uncertain ties of two trials 
based on essentially the same episode.”  Commentary on HRS 
§ 701-109(2).  Furthermore, “[i]t is designed to prevent the 
State from harassing a defendant with successive prosecutions 
where the State is dissatisfied with the punishment pre viously 
ordered or where the State has previously failed to convict the 
defendant.”  Carroll, 63 Haw. at 351, 627 P.2d at 780 (citing 
State v. Solomon , 61 Haw. 127, 134, 596 P.2d 779, 784 (1979)).  
Although it may be more straightforward  to determine 
when multiple offenses are (1)  “based on the same conduct,” 
(2) “known to the appropriate prosecuting officer at the time of 
the commencement of the first trial,” and (3)  “within the 
jurisdiction of a single court”; it is not always clear whether 
multiple offens es “aris[e] from the same episode.”  See, e.g. , *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
15 Akau, 118 Hawaiʻi 44, 185 P.3d 229; Keliiheleua , 105 Hawaiʻi 174, 
95 P.3d 605; State v. Servantes , 72 Haw. 35, 804 P.2d 1347  
(1991); Carroll, 63 Haw. 345, 627 P.2d 776.   Thus, this court 
has articulated that “the test for determining the singleness of 
a criminal episode should be based on whether the alleged 
conduct was so closely related in time, place and circumstances 
that a complete account of one charge cannot be related without 
referring to details of th e other charge .”  Carroll, 63 Haw. at 
351, 627 P.2d at 780.  
In light of the foregoing, HRS §  701-109(2) compels 
the State  to join multiple offenses in a single trial when three 
elements and three sub -elements are satisfied.  These are:  
(1) the offenses are based on the same conduct or arise 
from the same episode;  
(2) the offenses are all known to the appropriate 
prosecuting officer at the time of the commencement of 
the first trial; and  
(3) the offenses are within the jurisdiction of a single 
court. 
HRS § 701-109(2).  In order for the offenses to arise from the 
same episode, they must  
(a) be so closely related in time that a complete account 
of one charge cannot be related without referring to 
details of the other charge;  
(b) be so closely related in place that a complete ac count 
of one charge cannot be related without referring to 
details of the other charge; and  
(c) be so closely related in circumstances that a complete 
account of one charge cannot be related without 
referring to details of the other charge.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
16 Carroll, 63 Haw. at  351, 627 P.2d at 780.   If the State fails to 
try a defendant for multiple offenses that satisfy each of these 
elements in a single proceeding, the State is barred from 
bringing the related charges in a subsequent proceeding.  
HRS § 701-111(1)(b).11 
B. The circumstances element of the single -episode test 
requires the court to consider whether the offenses involve 
similar facts and /or issues. 
1. The origins of the single -episode test illustrate that 
multiple offenses are closely related in circumstances 
when the offenses are interrelated.  
As a preliminary matter, Carroll’s single-episode test 
is based upon  the test created by our sister court in State v. 
Boyd, 533 P.2d 795  (Or. 1975).  See Carroll, 63 Haw. at 349, 
351-52, 627 P.2d at 779 -81.  There, officers of the Eugene, 
Oregon police department executed a warrant to search  defendant 
                     
11  HRS § 701-111(1)(b) (2014)  provides:  
 
 Although a prosecution is for a violation of a different 
statutory provision or is based on different facts, it is 
barred by a former prosecution under any of the following 
circumstances:  
 
(1) The former prosecution resulted in an acquittal 
which has not subsequently been set aside or in a 
conviction as defined in section 701 -110(3) and 
the subsequent prosecution is for:  
 
. . . 
 
(b) Any offense for which the defendant should 
have been tried on the first prosecution 
under section 701 -109 unless the court 
ordered a separate trial of the offense[.]  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
17 Sharon Boyd’s home for evidence of a burglary .  Boyd, 533 P.2d 
at 796.  “In executing the  warrant, the police discovered 
evidence of a number of other crimes, including a television set 
stolen some months before, a quantity of amphetamine tablets, 
and more than an ounce of marijuana.”  Id.  An Oregonian 
prosecutor subsequently obtained two ind ictments against Boyd: 
one based on her possession of a stolen television and one for 
possession of amphetamines.  Id. at 796-97.  However, the 
prosecutor did not join the indictments for a single trial .  Id. 
at 797. 
According to Boyd, Oregon Revised Statu tes 
§ 132.560(2) required the prosecutor to join the  indictments in 
a single proceeding because she would otherwise be subject to 
double jeopardy.  Id. at 797-98.  The statute provided :  
When there are several charges against any person or 
persons for the same act or transaction , instead of having 
several indictments, the whole may be joined in one 
indictment in several counts; and if two or more 
indictments are found in such cases, the court may order 
them to be consolidated.  
Id. at 798 n.3 (emphasis added ). 
The Boyd court explained that the statute was designed 
to consolidate charges “where evidence of one offense would be 
relevant to evidence of another crime .”  Id. at 798 (quoting 
Proposed Oregon Criminal Procedure Code , § 84 cmt. at 50 
(1972)).   In turn, the court explained that the “initial *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
18 guideline” for joining charges is “if a complete account of one 
charge necessarily includes details of the other charge, the 
charges must be joined to avoid a later double jeopardy defense 
to further prosecution.”  Id. at 799.  The Oregon Supreme Court 
therefore “construe[d its] test of interrelated events as 
necessitating joinder only where the facts of [e]ach charge can 
be explained adequately only by drawing upon the facts of the 
other charge.  Stated differently, the charge[s] must be cross -
related.”  Id. 
Applying its test to the facts before it , the Oregon 
Supreme Court explained that the two charges should  have been 
brought together because “[t]he criminal code treats the fact of 
possession as a criminal act of a continuing nature.  In this 
statutory sense, the [possession] of the television set and the 
drugs, existing at the same place and time, constitute  a single 
occurrence.”  Id. at 801.  In the same vein, “[i]f a defendant 
is charged with the possession of drugs, some of which had been 
acquired at one time and the rest at another time, it would seem 
clear that he would be entitled to object to multiple 
prosecutions.”  Id.  However, the court pointed out, “[h]ad the 
defendant been charged with the actual theft of the television 
set on one occasion and the illegal purchase of drugs at another *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
19 time, it would be clear enough that the events would be 
unrelate d and therefore obviously not unitary.”  Id.  
In light of the Boyd court’s analysis, the fact that 
there may be some factual overlap between multiple charges does 
not require joinder.  Rather, the two charges must be “cross -
related” such that “a complete a ccount of one charge necessarily 
includes details  of the other charge.”  Id. at 799 (emphasis 
added). 
2. This court’s application of the circumstances element 
illustrates that multiple offenses are closely related 
in circumstances where there is substantive o verlap 
between the legal issues and /or facts. 
Our adoption and application of the single -episode 
test similarly establishes that a significant level of factual 
and/or legal overlap is necessary before multiple offenses are 
“so closely related in .  . . circumstances that a complete 
account of one charge cannot be related without referring to 
details of the other charge.”  Carroll, 63 Haw. at 351, 627 P.2d 
at 780. 
First, in Carroll, a private citizen reported that 
defendant Alfred Carroll started a fire on sc hool property.  Id. 
at 346, 627 P.2d at 777.  Police officers found Carroll, 
conducted a routine search, and arrested him.  Id.  During the 
routine search, the arresting office r found a canister but *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
20 returned it to Carro ll because the arresting officer thou ght the 
cannister contained nasal spray.  Id.  Less than an hour later, 
a different officer conducted a custodial search while booking 
Carroll and discovered a cannister of Mace in his possession.  
Id.  The State subsequently charged Carroll with attempted  
criminal property damage in the second degree, and with 
possession of an obnoxious substance.  Id.   
On appeal, Carroll encouraged this court to adopt the 
Boyd single-episode test  to determine if both charges should 
have been tried together .  Id. at 349, 627 P.2d at 779.  This 
court agreed, explaining that  
proximity in time, place and circumstances of the offenses 
will necessarily enter into the policy considerations 
underlying HRS §  701-109(2).  Where the offenses occur at 
the same time and place and under the same circumstances, 
it is likely that the facts  and issues involved in the 
charges will be similar .  The witnesses to be used and the 
evidence to be offered will probably overlap  to the extent 
that joinder of the charges would be justified.  Compulsory 
joinder of offenses which share a proximity in tim e, place 
and circumstances .  . . would also save the defendant and 
the State time and money required in the presentation of 
repetitive evidence . 
Id. at 351, 627 P.2d at 780 (emphasis added).  
Nevertheless, this court rejected Carroll’s 
contentions that the underlying offenses satisfied the 
circumstances component of the single -episode test because “the 
arresting officer failed to recognize the illegal nature of the 
cannister at the time of the search for weapons.  As a result , *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
21 [Carroll’s] possession of the Mace continued after his initial 
arrest, until the subsequent discovery and identification at the 
police station.”  Id. at 352, 627 P.2d at 781.  In turn, the 
possession charge was not effect ed until the officers found that 
the cannister contained an obnoxi ous substance .  Id.  
Second, in Servantes , police officers saw a passenger 
smoking marijuana in defendant Robin Servantes’s vehicle.  72 
Haw. at 36, 804 P.2d at 1348.   After the passenger stepped out 
of the vehicle, the officers saw a bag of marijuana next  to 
Servantes’s foot, arrested Servantes  for promoting a detrimental 
drug in the third degree, and impounded his vehicle.   Id. at 36-
37, 804 P.2d at 1348.  Based on the arrest, the officers 
obtained and executed a search warrant for the vehicle and 
discovered cocaine and drug paraphernalia.  Id. at 37, 804 P.2d 
at 1348.  The State then also charged Servantes with promoting a 
dangerous drug in the third degree and possession with intent to 
use drug paraphernalia.  Id.  This court held that the two 
offenses w ere closely related in circumstances because (1)  the 
charges arose from Servantes’s simultaneous loss of possession 
of both the marijuana and cocaine, and (2)  the initial charge 
provided probable cause to suspect that Servantes possessed 
additional illicit  substances.  Id. at 39, 804 P.2d at 1349.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
22 Third, in Keliiheleua , defendant Christopher 
Keliiheleua rear -ended a parked car on November 18, 2000, 
injuring a passenger in his own vehicle as well as the driver of 
the parked car .  105 Hawaiʻi at 176, 95 P.3d at 607.  Later that 
same day, Keliiheleua obtained an insurance policy and filed a 
claim asserting that the accident occurred after he purchased 
the policy.  Id.  The State discovered Keliiheleua’s actions and 
charged him with insurance fraud.  Id. at 176-77, 95 P.3d at 
607-08.  On December 6, 2001, Keliiheleua entered a no contest 
plea on the insurance fraud charge.  Id. at 177, 95 P.3d at 608.  
Nine months later, the State also charged Keliiheleua with 
negligent injury in the first degree for harming his passenger.  
Id.  This court determined that “the circumstances of the cases 
were not similar” because “the facts and issues involved in the 
charges (namely, the statutory requirements of the alleged 
offenses) are dissimilar.”   Id. at 182, 95 P.3d at 613.  The 
court also rejected Keliiheleua’s attempt to analogize his case 
with Servantes , noting that “there was no reason to suspect that 
subsequent to causing the motor vehicle accident, Defendant 
would obtain an insurance policy and then fi le a fraudulent 
insurance claim.  Furthermore, unlike the offenses involved in 
Servantes , the negligent injury charge can be tried without 
mention of the fraud case .”  Id. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
23 Considering  our precedents , this court has declined to 
hold that multiple offenses a rise from a single episode simply 
because the offenses share some common facts.  For instance, in 
Carroll, the possession offense was only discovered because a 
booking officer searched Carroll after he was brought in for 
attempted criminal property damage .  63 Haw. at 346, 627 P.2d at 
777.  Similarly, in Keliiheleua , the insurance fraud offense 
necessarily shared some factual overlap with  the negligent 
injury offense because both offenses followed the same vehicular 
collision.  105 Hawaiʻi at 176-77, 95 P.3 d at 607-08. 
Our precedents make clear , instead,  that multiple 
offenses arise from the same episode when the offenses are 
legally connected  and/or share substanti al factual overlap .  
Although this court did not hold that the Carroll offenses or 
the Keliiheleua offenses satisfied the single -episode test, our 
discussion of the circumstances element in Carroll and 
Keliiheleua  is illuminating.  Again, in Carroll, this court 
suggested that when offenses arise from the same episode, “the 
facts and issues involved  in the charges will be similar” and 
create an overlap in the evidence to be presented .  63 Haw. at 
351, 627 P.2d at 7 80.  The Keliiheleua  court reiterated  this 
explanation, stating that the offenses therein were not closely 
related in circumstances becaus e “the facts and issues involved *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
24 in the charges (namely, the statutory requirements of the 
alleged offenses) are dissimilar.”  105 Hawaiʻi at 182, 95 P.3d 
at 613. 
Although the Servantes  court did not provide any 
significant analysis of why its underlying facts and issues were 
connected, it is evident that the offenses therein satisf ied the 
similar facts and issues requirement identified by Carroll and 
Keliiheleua .  See 72 Haw. at 38 -39, 804 P.2d at 1349.   At the 
time Servantes committed the rel evant offenses, “[a] person 
commit[ted] the offense of promoting a detrimental drug in the 
third degree if he knowingly possesse [d] any marijuana or any 
Schedule V substance in any amount.”  HRS § 712-1249(1) (1985).   
Similarly, “[a] person commit[ ted] the offense of promoting a 
dangerous drug in the third degree if he knowingly possesse [d] 
any dangerous drug in any amount.”  HRS § 712-1243(1) (1985).   
Lastly,  
[i]t [was] unlawful for any person to use, or to possess 
with intent to use, drug paraphernalia t o plant, propagate, 
cultivate, grow, harvest, manufacture, compound, convert, 
produce, process, prepare, test, analyze, pack, repack, 
store, contain, conceal, inject, ingest, inhale, or 
otherwise introduce into the human body a controlled 
substance in viol ation of this chapter.  
HRS § 329-43.5(a) (Supp. 1992).12   
                     
12  Marijuana was classified as a Schedule I controlled substance.  
HRS § 329-14(d)(16) (Supp. 1992).  
 Additionally, “drug paraphernalia” was defined in relevant part as  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
25 Based upon these statutory requirements, the 
proceedings against Servantes were legally and factually 
interrelated insofar as evidence which would prove Servantes 
promoted a detrimental drug in the third degree could also be 
used to prove Servantes possessed with the intent to use drug 
paraphernalia.  Specifically, the police found Servantes with “a 
clear plastic bag of marijuana .  . . next to [his] foot.”   
Servantes , 72 Haw. at 36, 804 P.2d at 134 8. 
In light of the foregoing, we clarify that multiple 
offenses must be legally and /or factually interrelated in order 
to be “so closely related in .  . . circumstances that a complete 
account of one charge cannot be related without referring to 
details of th e other charge.”  Carroll, 63 Haw. at 351, 627 P.2d 
at 780.13 
                     
“all equipment, products, and materials of any kind which are used .  . . in 
. . . storing [ or] containing .  . . a controlled substance in violation of 
this chapter.  It includes, but is not limited to .  . . [c]ontainers and 
other objects used .  . . in stori ng or concealing controlled substances. ” 
HRS § 329-1 (Supp. 1992).  
 
13  Given HRS § 701-109’s “dual considerations of fairness to the defendant 
and society’s interest in efficient law enforcement,”  State v. Carroll , 63 
Haw. 345, 351, 627 P.2d 776, 780 (1981 ), we note that prosecutors may 
consider joining potentially related offenses even when not required to do so 
by HRS §  701-109 and this opinion.  Then, as the Boyd court noted,  
 
[t]he defendant may oppose, acquiesce in, or join in th [e] 
motion or, if the charges were initially brought together, 
move for severance.  The defendant will thus be forced to 
make a choice as to joinder or severance .  . . .  Any 
objections the defendant might make to the prosecutor’s 
choice would thereafter b e waived.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
26 3. The presence of probable cause alone does not 
establish a close relationship in circumstances 
between multiple offenses.  
Despite this court’s prior examinations of facts and 
issues to evaluate w hether multiple offenses arise from a single 
episode, the Akau majority deviated from our history by focusing 
on “whether the facts and circumstances of the first discovered 
offense provided sufficient probable cause to suspect that the 
defendant had commi tted or would commit the second discovered 
offense.”  See Akau, 118 Hawaiʻi at 57, 185 P.3d at 242.  
The Akau majority’s focus on probable cause is 
problematic insofar as the mere presence of probable cause does 
not mean that “a complete account of one char ge cannot be 
related without referring to details of the other charge.”  
Carroll, 63 Haw. at 351, 627 P.2d at 780.   
Conversely, multiple offenses may be closely related 
in circumstances even when one offense does not provide probable 
cause to suspect the defendant of committing the other.  For 
instance, in Boyd, the Oregon Supreme Court did not contemplate 
whether the fact that Boyd possessed a television set provide d 
the police with probable cause to suspect that she also 
possessed illicit substances .  See generally  533 P.2d 795.   
                     
553 P.2d 795, 800 (Or. 1975). *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
27 Nevertheless,  the Boyd court held that the offenses arose from 
the same episode because  
the [possession] of the television set and the drugs, 
existing at the same place and time, constitute a single 
occurrence.  Once unlawful possession of goods, without 
more, is recognized as criminal conduct, there is no reason 
for fragmenting the criminal c onduct into as many parts as 
there are different items of property, however acquired.  
Id. at 801. 
Thus, the presence or absence of probable cause is not 
dispositive in determining whether multiple offenses are so 
closely related in circumstances that a com plete account of one 
charge cannot be related without referring to details of the 
other charge.  Nevertheless , the presence of probable cause may 
be relevant where, for instance, there are common elements 
between the statutory requirements of multiple offe nses.  See, 
e.g., Servantes , 72 Haw. at 3 9, 804 P.2d at 134 9. 
We therefore hold that Akau was wrongly decided 
insofar as it held that the existence of probable cause is 
sufficient to compel the joinder of multiple offenses in a 
single proceeding .14
                     
14  Because probable cause is not sufficient to compel joinder of multiple 
offenses in a single proceeding, we need not address which offense was 
discovered first or if “the facts and circumstances of the first discov ered 
offense provided sufficient probable cause to suspect that the defendant had 
committed or would commit the second discovered offense .”  Instead, as 
discussed below, compulsory joinder of the trial of the Traffic Offenses with 
that of the Assault Offen se is not necessary in this case based on (1)  a lack 
of overlap between the legal issues  presented by the Traffic Offenses and the 
Assault Offense; and (2)  a lack of overlap between the material facts of the 
Traffic Offenses and those of the Assault Offens e. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
C. The Traffic Offenses and the Assault Offense are not so 
closely related in circumstances that a complete account of 
the Assault Offense cannot be related without referring to 
details of the Traffic Offenses.  
Turning to the offenses before us, HRS §  701-109(2) 
does not compel the joinder of the trial of the Traffic Offenses 
with that of the Assault Offense.  
As a preliminary matter, Sardinha concedes that the 
Traffic Offenses may be tried without reference to the Assault 
Offense.  Thus, the question is whether a co mplete account of 
the Assault Offense may be related without referring to details 
of the Traffic Offenses.  Carroll, 63 Haw. at 351, 627 P.2d at 
780.  It may. 
First, there is no overlap between the legal issues 
presented by the Traffic Offenses and the legal issue presented 
by the Assault Offense.  In order to prevail on a charge of 
inattention to driving, the State was required to show that 
Sardinha “operate[d]  any vehicle without due care or in a manner 
as to cause a collision with, or injury or damage to, as the 
case may be, any person, vehicle or other property .”  HRS § 291-
12.  Similarly, the State would have had to show that Sardinha 
drove without a valid l icense; drove while his license was 
revoked; drove, caused a collision resulting in property damage, 
and did not return to and remain at the scene of the collision; *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
29 drove while his license was revoked for operating a vehicle 
under the influence of an intox icant; or drove an uninsured 
vehicle in order to prevail on the other cited traffic offenses.  
See generally  HRS §§ 286-102(a), 286-132, 291C-13, 291E-62(a), 
431:10C-104(a).  In contrast, to prevail in a trial for the 
Assault Offense, the State has to esta blish that Sardinha  
“[i]ntentionally or knowingly cause[d] bodily injury to a law 
enforcement officer who [was] engaged in the performance of 
duty.”  HRS § 707-712.5(1).  
Based purely on the elements of the charges, any 
evidence that would establish that Sa rdinha was responsible for 
the Traffic Offenses would not establish that Sardinha assaulted 
a law enforcement officer, and vice versa.  See Keliiheleua , 105 
Hawaiʻi at 182, 95 P.3d at 613  (“[I]n this case, the facts and 
issues involved in the charges (name ly the statutory 
requirements of the alleged offenses) are dissimilar.”) . 
Second, there is no substantive overlap between the 
material facts of the Traffic Offenses and those of the Assault 
Offense.  Sardinha asserts that he “could have” cross -examined 
the officers about the Traffic Offenses “to evidence their 
perception of Sardinha .  . . and their bias, interest and motive 
that may have colored their actions during the assault 
incident.”  Carroll forecloses Sardinha’s attempt to bootstrap *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
30 the Traffic Offen ses to the Assault Offense via potential  cross-
examination questions.  Defense counsel there could have cross -
examined the booking officer about the officer’s knowledge of 
the attempted arson.  See Carroll, 63 Haw. at 346, 627 P.2d at 
777.  However, this c ourt held that  the Carroll offenses did not 
arise from a single episode.  Id.  Thus, we clarify that the 
relevant inquiry is not whether a defendant  could elicit facts 
about the other offense, but whether the prosecution  can fairly 
put on a complete case without reference to the other offense.  
Sardinha also claims that the offenses arose from a 
single episode because the Assault Offense was “precipitated by 
the officers’ recognition that the vehicle he was sitting in had 
been involved in the [Traffic Offenses].”  Sardinha’s attempt to 
sanitize the Assault Offense and merge two unrelated events is 
unpersuasive .  The record establishes that Sardinha acted 
belligerently towards the officers before the officers even 
noticed th e vehicle .  Officer Ngyuen reported that Sardinha “was 
yelling profanities at me and Officer S. SESOKO calling us 
‘fucking pussy bitches’.”  Officer Sesoko similarly recounted 
that Sardinha “[s]tated he would kick our ass [sic] if we didn’t 
have our badges .” 
Furthermore, the assault occurred because the officers 
detained Sardinha for a possible contempt warrant – not the *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
31  Traffic Offenses.  Once the officers identified Sardinha, they 
detained Sardinha because of a possible contempt warrant — not 
because of h is potential involvement with the Traffic Offenses.  
Sardinha then headbutted Officer Sesoko when the officers 
attempted to place Sardinha in  the squad car to wait for 
confirmation of the warrant.  
Accordingly, the facts and issues of the Traffic 
Offenses a re dissimilar to those of the Assault Offense.  See 
Keliiheleua, 105 Hawaiʻi at 182, 95 P.3d at 613.   In turn, the 
offenses are not “so closely related in .  . . circumstances that 
a complete account of one charge cannot be related without 
referring to deta ils of the other char ge.”  Carroll, 63 Haw. at 
351, 627 P.2d at 780.  Compulsory joinder is therefore not 
required.15  
IV. CONCLUSION  
In light of the foregoing, the Traffic Offenses  and 
the Assault Offense did not arise from the same episode.   The 
circuit court therefore acted contrary to the rules and 
principles of law in granting Sardinha’s motion to dismiss, and 
                     
15  Under the single-episode test, joinder is only necessary where multiple 
offenses are “so closely related in time, place and circumstances that a 
complete account of one charge cannot be related without referring to details 
of the other charge.”   Carroll, 63 Haw. at 351, 627 P.2d at 780 (emphasis 
added).  Because we hold that the Traffic Offenses and the Assault Offense 
were not closely related in circumstances, we need not address Sardinha’s 
contentions that the offenses are closely related in tim e or place.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
32 abused its discretion.  See Carr, 79 Hawaiʻi at 488, 904 P.2d at 
502.  In turn, t he ICA correctly determined that the State need 
not try Sardinha for both incidents in a single proceeding.   
Accordingly, we affirm t he ICA’s February 18, 2021  
Judgment on Appeal, which vacated the circuit court’s 
October 14, 2016 Order Granting Defendant Bronson Sardinha’s 
Motion to Dismiss with Prejudice .
