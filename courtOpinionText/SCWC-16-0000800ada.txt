OPINION OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J. 
 
I. Introduction 
 
Deborah Ann Hokulani Joshua (“Joshua”), a self -represented 
litigant, seeks revi ew of the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ 
(“ICA”) February 16, 2017 “Order Granting December 12, 2016 Electronically Filed

 Motion to Dismiss Appeal for Lack of Appellate Jurisdiction.”  
We hold the ICA did not err in dismissing Joshua’s appeal for  
lack of appellate jurisdictio n because Joshua’s November 6, 2016 
third notice of appeal was untimely, and because we lack 
jurisdiction to review the dismissal of Joshua’s second notice 
of appeal because she did not seek certiorari review of that 
dismissal.   
The dismissal of Joshua’s June 16, 2015 second notice of 
appeal under the circumstances of this case, however, causes us 
to reexamine the impact on access to justice of our previous 
mandate that appeals be dismissed when a purported circuit court 
final judgment fails to meet appealability requirements.  See 
Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright , 76 Hawaii 115, 119, 
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994)  (per curiam).  Pursuant to our 
supervisory powers under Hawaii Revised Statutes (“ HRS”) § 602-4 
(2016),1 we reinforce our advisement in Bailey v. Duvauchelle , 
135 Hawai i 482, 492, 353 P.3d 1024, 1034 (2015), that when 
circuit courts intend their rulings to be final and appealable, 
they must enter appealable final judgments.  To more fully 
address the concerns we expressed in Bailey, however, and as 
more fully discussed in Section IV(C) below, we  prospectively 
                         
1  HRS § 602- 4 provides, “ The supreme court shall have the general 
superintendence of all courts of inferior jurisdiction to prevent and correct 
errors and abuses therein where no other remedy is expressly provided by 
law.”    
  ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   ***

 hold that when a party to a circuit court civil case timely 
appeals a purportedly appealable final judgment later determined 
not to meet Jenkins requirements, rather than dismiss the 
appeal, the ICA must temporarily remand the case to the circuit 
court “in aid of its jurisdiction” pursuant to HRS § 602-57(3) 
2(2016)  for entry of an appealable final judgment with a 
direction to the circuit court to supplement the record on 
appeal with the final judgment.  This holding is consistent with 
our recent opinion in Waikiki v. Ho omaka Vill. Ass’n of 
Apartment Owners , 140 Hawai i 197, 204, 398 P.3d 786, 793 (2017) 
(per curiam), in which we held that under  the circumstances of 
that case, the ICA should have exercised its authority under HRS 
§ 602-57(3) to remand for entry of an appealable final judgment 
instead of dismissing the appeal.  
II. Background 
 On February 4, 2008 the State of Hawai ‘i Office of Consumer 
Protection (“OCP”) fil ed a complaint in the Circuit Court of the 
First Circuit (“circuit court”)3 seeking declaratory and 
                         
2  HRS § 602- 57(3) provides, in relevant part:  
 
Jurisdiction .  Notwithstanding any other law to the 
contrary, the intermediate appellate court shall have 
jurisdiction[:] 
      . . . . 
      (3)  To make or issue any order or writ necessary or appropriate in the 
aid of its jurisdiction, and in such case, any judge may issue a writ or an 
order to show cause returnable before the court.

 injunctive relief against Joshua and two other defendants for 
their involvement in a foreclosure rescue or equity- stripping 
scheme.  Because Joshua did not answer the complaint, the 
circuit court entered default against her on March 10, 2008.  
The other two defendants each answered the complaint and filed 
cross-claims against Joshua.    
 On September 4, 2008, the circuit court issued a permanent 
injunction and default judgment against Joshua, enjoining her 
from participating in activities that involved real property in 
foreclosure or risk  of foreclosure or that had a lien  or 
encumbrance charged against it because of nonpayment of 
association fees or maintenance fees.   The two other defendants 
entered into a stipulated permanent injunction and order.  Final 
judgment was entered against all three defendants on May 14, 
2009.  No party appealed.    
 Six years later, on January 8, 2015, the circuit court4 
entered its “Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order of 
Contempt and Order Modifying Permanent Injunction,” finding 
Joshua in willful contempt of the permanent injunction and 
ordering modification of the inju nction (“modification order”).  
On January 23, 2015, Joshua filed a notice of appeal from the 
modification order, in CAAP- 15-0000046.  On April 14, 2015, the 
ICA dismissed Joshua’s appeal for lack of jurisdiction because 
                         
4  The Honorable Jeannette H. Castagnetti presided.  ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   ***  
 
5 
 the circuit court had not entered an appealable final judgment 
incorporating the modification order.    
 After this dismissal, on June 8, 2015, OCP filed a motion 
requesting that the circuit court enter an amended final 
judgment and permanent injunction, and attached its proposed 
document as Exhibit “A.”   Before the circuit court ruled, Joshua 
filed her second notice of appeal on June 16, 2015, in CAAP- 15-
0000915.  Joshua indicated that she was appealing OCP’s amended 
final judgment and permanent injunction.  The circuit court then 
granted OCP’s motion,  and entered an amended final judgment and 
permanent injunction on September 25, 2015 (“amended final 
judgment”).  The amended final judgment cited to Rule 58 of the 
Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (“HRCP”) (2010) and indicat ed 
that it was “intended to be a final judgment for all purposes, 
including appeal.”   
On June 28, 2016, however, the ICA entered a five- page 
order dismissing Joshua’s second appeal for lack of appellate 
jurisdiction due to the lack of an appealable final judgment 
meeting Jenkins requirements.  The ICA provided a detailed 
explanation of the deficiencies in the amended final judgment.  
The ICA explained that the amended judgment did not specifically 
identify the claim or claims on which the court intended to 
enter judgment in favor of OCP and against Joshua, failed to 
enter judgment on OCP’s claims against the other two defendants, ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   ***  
 
6 
 and did not expressly enter judgment on or state that the cross-
claims against Joshua were dismissed.    
 The next day, OCP filed a motion requesting that the 
circuit court enter a second amended final judgment and 
permanent injunction to address shortcomings in the amended 
final judgment identified by the ICA.  On October 6, 2016, the 
circuit court entered a second amended final judgment (“second 
amended judgment”) and permanent  injunction.  Thirty-four days 
later, on November 9, 2016, Joshua filed her third notice of 
appeal, indicating she was appealing the circuit court’s 
September 28, 2016 minute order granting OCP’s June 29, 2016 
motion requesting that it enter a second amended judgment.    
On December 12, 2016, OCP filed a motion to dismiss 
Joshua’s third notice of appeal for lack of appellate 
jurisdiction based on untimeliness, as it had been filed more 
than thirty days after the second amended judgment.  Joshua 
submitted payment of $315 for this third notice of appeal,5 but 
she did not file an opposition to OCP’s motion to dismiss.  
On February 16, 2017, the ICA ruled on the motion to 
dismiss.  The ICA noted Joshua had failed to file a memorandum 
in response to OCP’s motion.   Citing Hawai ʻi Rules of Appellate 
                         
5  In her first and second appeals in CAAP -15-0000046 and CAAP -15-0000915, 
Joshua’s motions for leave to proceed on appeal in forma pa uperis were 
granted by the ICA, and she paid no appellate fees.    ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   ***

 Procedure (“HRAP”) Rule 3(c)(2) (2015),6 the ICA construed 
Joshua’s third notice of appeal to be from the October 6, 2016 
second amended judgment rather than from the September 28, 2016
minute order.  Because Joshua’s thi rd notice of appeal was not 
filed within thirty days of the October 6, 2016 second amended 
7judgment as required by HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) (2016),  however, the
ICA granted OCP’s motion, and dismissed the appeal for lack of 
appellate jurisdiction.     
 
 Joshua filed an application for writ of certiorari alleging 
error in the ICA’s jurisdictional ruling.   We accepted 
certiorari to address the issue of appellate jurisdiction. 
III. Standard of Review 
 “The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law that we 
review de novo under the right/wrong standard.”  Lester v. Rapp , 
85 Hawai‘ i 238, 241, 942 P.2d 502, 505 (1997) (citation omitted). 
 “A court always has jurisdiction to determine whether it 
has jurisdiction over a particular case.”  State v. Brandimart , 
68 Haw. 495, 496, 720 P.2d 1009, 1010 (1986).  
 
 
                         
6  HRAP Rule 3(c)(2) provides that “[a]n appeal shall not be dismissed for 
informality of form or title of notice of appeal.”  
 
7  HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) provides  that “[w]hen a civil appeal is permitted by 
law, the notice of appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the 
judgment or appealable order.”

 IV. Discussion 
A. Background of the Jenkins separate judgment requirement and 
 the requirement for dismissal of appeals for lack of 
appellate jurisdiction   
 
 
Pursuant to Hawai ‘i Constitution article VI, section 1,  our 
appellate courts have “appellate jurisdiction as provided by 
law.”  HRS § 641 -1 (2016) governs appeals in civil matters to 
the ICA and since 2010 has read: 
§ 641
-1 Appeals as of right or interlocutory, civil 
matters. (a)  Appeals shall be allowed in civil matters 
from all final judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit and 
district courts and the land court to the intermediate 
appellate court, subject to chapter 602.  
 
(b)  Upon application made within the time provided by the 
rules of court, an appeal in a civil matter may be allowed 
by a circuit court in its discretion from an order denying 
a motion to dismiss or from any interlocutory judgment, 
order, or decree whenever the circuit court may think the 
same advisable for the speedy termination of litigation 
before it.   The refusal of the circuit court to allow an 
appeal from an interlocutory judgment, order, or decree 
shall not be reviewable by any other court.  
 
(c)  An appeal shall be taken  in the manner and within the 
time provided by the rules of court.  
 
The appeal to the ICA in this case is governed by HRS § 
641-1(a) (2016) and concerns appellate jurisdiction over an 
appeal from a circuit court final judgment.  HRS § 641- 1(b) 
(2016) provides that civil appeal deadlines are to be “provided 
by the rules of court” and HRS § 641 -1(c) (2016) provides that 
“[a]n appeal shall be taken in the manner and within the time 
provided by the rules of court.”  In general, HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) 
provides that “[w]hen a civil appeal is permitted by law, the 
notice of appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry of ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   ***  
 
9 
 the judgment or appealable order.”  Thus, rules of court govern 
civil appeal deadlines as well as the manner in which civil 
appeals will be taken.  
Before our 1994 opinion in
 Jenkins , we had held that 
“[w]hen the trial court ’s disposition of a case involving 
multiple claims or multiple parties is embodied in several 
orders, no one of which embraces the entire controversy but 
which collectively do so, it is a necessary inference from 
[HRCP] Rule 54(b)  that the orders collectively constitute a 
final judgment and that entry of the last of the series of 
orders gives finality and appealability to all. ”  City and 
County of Honolulu v. Midkiff , 57 Haw. 273, 275, 554 P.2d 233, 
234-35 (1976).  Thus, we previously allowed a series of orders 
to constitute an appealable “judgment.”  
In Jenkins, however, due to the burden on appellate courts 
of “searching a voluminous record for evidence of finality,” and 
“to establish bright line rules so there will be little doubt in 
most cases about when an appeal may be taken,” we set out 
specific requirements before appeals could be taken from circuit 
court final judgments in civil cases.  Jenkins, 76 Hawai i at 
119, 869 P.2d at 1338 .  We held:   
(1) An appeal may be taken from circuit court orders 
resolving claims against parties only after the orders have
been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been 
entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties 
pursuant to HRCP 58; (2) if a judgment purports to be the 
final judgment in a case involving multiple claims or  ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   ***  
 
10 
 multiple parties, the judgment (a) must specifically 
identify the party or parties for and against whom the 
judgment is entered, and (b) must (i) identify the claims 
for which it is entered, and (ii) dismiss any claims not 
specifically identified; (3) if the judgment resolves fewer
than all claims against all parties, or reserves any claim 
for later action by the court, an appeal may be taken only 
if the judgment contains th
e language necessary for 
certification under HRCP 54(b); and (4) an appeal from any 
judgment will be dismissed as premature if the judgment 
does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against 
all parties or contain the finding necessary for 
8certification under  HRCP 54(b).[ ]  
                         
8  Jenkins requirements for appealable final judgments apply only to 
appeals from circuit court civil cases under HRS § 641 -1(a).  Accordingly, 
the requirements do not apply to civil appeals from the district courts, 
Casupang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai i 425, 427,  984 P.2d 1251, 1253 (1999).   
Jenkins also does not apply to orders resolving post -judgment proceedings.  
See Ditto v. McCurdy , 103 Hawai i 153, 159, 80 P.3d 974, 980 (2003) (“Clearly, 
the rule in Jenkins . . . is limited to circuit court orders disposing of 
claims raised in a circuit court complaint.”) (emphasis omitted).  P ursuant 
to Bailey, 135 Hawai i 482, 353 P.3d 1024, however, an order on a HRCP Rule 
60(b) motion for relief from a final judgment is not appealable without an 
underlying judgment that is a final, appealable judgment under Jenkins.  
 Despite the above -quoted language in Ditto stating that the Jenkins 
rule “is limited to circuit court orders disposing of claims raised in a 
circuit court complaint,” we also applied the Jenkins separate judgment 
requirement to a circuit court case involving a verified petition seeking 
judicial forfeiture of property.  Carlisle v. One (1) Boat , 119 Hawai i 245, 
254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008).     
Jenkins does not apply where statutes other than HRS § 641 -1(a) govern 
appealability, such as in the child custody or arbitration contexts.  See In 
re Doe, 77 Hawai i 109, 114 n.9, 883 P.2d 30, 35 n.9 (1994) (“We note that, 
due to the nature of ‘final’ judgment in chi ld custody cases, the 
requirements for appealability set forth in [ Jenkins] are inapplicable in 
such custody cases”); Oppenheimer v. AIG Hawai i Ins. Co., 77 Hawai i 88, 92-
93, 881 P.2d 1234, 1238 -39 (1994) (“Based upon well -established principles of 
statutory construction, the more specific Arbitration and Award statute, HRS 
chapter 658, must prevail over the general appeal statute, HRS § 641 -1.”).  
Jenkins also does not apply to immediately appealable collateral orders.  See 
e.g., Siangco v. Kasadate , 77 Hawai i 157, 160 -61, 883 P.2d 78, 81 -82 (1994) 
(“[W]e have held that ‘[c]ertain collateral orders affecting rights which are 
independent of, and separable from the rights asserted in the main action . . 
. are ‘immediately appealable since they may not be e ffectively reviewable 
and rights could be lost, perhaps irretrievably, if review invariably had to 
await final judgment.’”); Greer v. Baker, 137 Hawai i 249, 255, 369 P.3d 832, 
837 (2016) (denial of absolute immunity claim is an immediately appealable 
collateral order).  In addition, in a HRS § 641 -1(b) appeal where there is a 
proper HRCP Rule 54(b) certification of entry of a final judgment of “one or 
more but fewer than all of the claims or parties” along with “an express 
determination that there is no just reason for delay[,]” the Jenkins 
requirement for a final judgment on all claims and parties does not apply.  
See Weinberg v. Mauch , 78 Hawai i 40, 46, 890 P.2d 277, 283 (1995) (HRCP Rule 
(continued. . .)  ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   ***  
 
11 
  
Id. (emphasis added).  We also held:  
 
[A]fter March 31, 1994 an appeal from an order that 
purports to be a final order as to all claims and parties 
in civil cases may be taken only after the order has been 
reduced to a judgment in favor of or against the parties. 
If claims are resolved by a series of orders, a final 
judgment upon all the claims must be entered.   The 
“judgment shall not contain a recital of the pleadings,” 
HRCP 54(a) , but it must, on its face , show finality as to 
all claims against all parties.  An appeal from an order 
that is not reduced to a  judgment in favor of or against 
the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme 
court will be dismissed [.] 
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai ʻi at 119 -20, 869 P.2d at 1338- 39 (latter 
emphasis added; footnotes omitted).     
Thus, in Jenkins, we redefined what would constitute an 
appealable “judgment” and began  enforcing the separate judgment 
requirement of HRCP Rule 58.  We held an appealable final 
judgment, for purposes of HRS § 641-1(a), must be set forth in a
separate judgment that also meets the requirements for a final 
judgment set forth in the opinion.  Consistent with our previous
case law requiring dismissal of civil appeals lacking appellate  
 
jurisdiction for lack of a “final order” under HRS 641 -1(a), see 
Familian Northwest, Inc. v. Cent. Pac. Boiler & Piping, Ltd. , 68 
                                                                               
(continued. . .) 
54(b) certification of decree of foreclosure); Jenkins, 76 Hawai i at 120, 869 
P.2d at 1339 (“If a judgment purports to be certified under HRCP 54(b), the 
necessary finding of no just reason for delay . . . must be included in the 
judgment.”) (citation omitted).  Jenkins also does not apply to appeals under 
the Forgay doctrine (which, in limited circumstances, permits a direct appeal 
from an interlocutory order that commands the immediate transfer of 
property).  Lambert v. Teisina , 131 Hawai i 457, 461 & 461 n.8, 319 P.3d 376, 
380 & 380 n.8 (2014).  
 The ICA has also held that the Rule 58 separate judgment requirement of 
Jenkins applies to circuit court rulings on appeals from administrative 
agencies.  See Raquinio v.  Nakanelua, 77 Hawai i 499, 500, 889 P.2d 76, 77 
(App. 1995).  ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   ***  
 
12 
 Haw. 368, 369, 714 P.2d 936, 937 (1986), Jenkins also held that 
an appeal from an “order” not reduced to “a judgment” would be 
dismissed.  76 Hawai ‘i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. 
Until July 1, 2006, all appeals initially came directly to 
this court rather than to the ICA.  See 2004 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 
202, § 55 at 939.  Af ter Jenkins, we began dismissing appeals or 
approved dismissal of appeals where the circuit court had 
entered a judgment intended to be final, but the judgment did 
not comply with  requirements.9   
In our 2015 Bailey 
Jenkins
opinion, we examined certain problems 
resulting from dismissal of appeals based on failure of a 
purported final judgment to meet Jenkins requirements: 
This case illustrates the problems that can arise 
when the requirements of finality set forth in Jenkins are 
not met.  The circuit courts are required to render 
appealable final judgments that comport with the 
requirements of Jenkins,  and should resolve any material 
deficiency in a judgment that is brought to their 
attention.  Where a party requests that the circuit court 
enter an appealable judgment  after an appellate court 
dismissed an appeal  for lack of appellate jurisdiction 
based on non -compliance with Jenkins , and the circuit court 
intended its ruling to be final and appealable, the circuit 
                         
9  See, e.g., Association of Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea 
Resort Co. , 100 Hawai i 97, 103 n.5, 58 P.3d 608, 614 n.5 (2002) (noting 
dismissal of initial appeal, because initial judgment did not comply with 
Jenkins and a “final [appealable] judgment which did not differ substantively 
or in the monetary amount specified was subsequently entered[.]”); 
Kahoohanohano v. Dep’t of Human Servs. , 117 Hawai i 262, 280 n.28, 178 P.3d 
538, 556 n.28 (2008) (noting that the ICA previously dismissed DHS’ appeal 
for lack of appellate jurisdiction due to the lack of an appealable final 
judgment meeting Jenkins  requirements); County of Hawai i v. Ala Loop 
Homeowners , 123 Hawai i 391, 401, 235 P.3d 1103, 1113 (2010) (noting that this 
court had dismissed a previous appeal because the judgment did not comply 
with Jenkins); Oahu Publ’ns, Inc. v. Abercrombie , 134 Hawai i 16, 20, 332 P.3d 
159, 163 (2014) (noting that the ICA had dismissed a previous appeal because 
the former judgment did not satisfy Jenkins  requirements). ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   ***  
 
13 
 court must enter an appealable judgment.  Also, upon 
learning of such a dismissal and determining that there are 
no further proceedings in the appellate courts, the circuit 
court should consider appropriate steps to correct the 
deficiency, including directing the prevailing party to 
prepare and submit a proposed appealable final judgment.   
See HRCP Rule 58 .  Lastly, we emphasize that the parties 
should assist the courts in ensuring that appealable final 
judgments are entered, including when an appellate court 
dismissed an appeal on that basis . 
 
Bailey, 135 Hawaii at 491-92, 353 P.3d at 1033- 34 (footnotes 
omitted).  
 More recently, in Waikiki, we held where an appellant had 
made several attempts to secure a final judgment, including 
submitting a proposed final judgment to the circuit court for 
approval and entry and seeking relief from the ICA for an order 
compelling the circuit court to enter a final judgment, “the ICA 
should have exercised its authority under HRS § 602- 57(3) to 
direct the circuit court to enter an appropriate appealable 
final judgment.”  Waikiki, 140 Hawai i at 204, 398 P.3d at 793. 
 Under this backdrop, we turn to our analysis of this case.  
B. Appellate jurisdiction does not exist because Joshua’s 
third notice of appeal was untimely. 
 
As noted above, Joshua filed three notices of appeal.  Her 
first notice of appeal was dismissed by the ICA for lack of 
appellate jurisdiction based on Jenkins because no final 
judgment had entered from which to appeal.  Her second notice of 
appeal was dismissed because the circuit court’s amended final 
judgment, although purportedly a final judgment, did not meet ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   ***  
 
14 
 Jenkins requirements.  We note that Joshua did not seek 
certiorari review of this dismissal.  Joshua’s third notice of 
appeal, which led to this certiorari proceeding, was dismissed 
for lack of appellate jurisdiction  because it was filed thirty-
four days after the appealable October 6, 2016 second amended 
final judgment.  
 This thirty -fourth day filing occurred after the thirty-day 
limit for filing an appeal set by HRAP Rule 4(a)(1).  Thus, 
Joshua’s third notice of appeal did  not result in  appellate 
jurisdiction.   
C. Prospective Rule 
 
Although we lack appellate jurisdiction over this case, t he 
dismissal of Joshua’s June 16, 2015 second notice of appeal and 
the circumstances of this case causes us to reexamine the impact 
on access to justice of our previous mandate that appeals be 
dismissed when a purported circuit court final judgment fails to 
meet appealability requirements. Jenkins, 76 Hawaii at 119, 869 
P.2d at 1338.  Pursuant to our supervisory powers under HRS § 
10602-4 (2016),  we reinforce our advisement in Bailey, that where 
a circuit court intends its ruling  to be final and appealable, 
                         
10  HRS § 602-4 provides, “ Superintendence of inferior courts.   The supreme 
court shall have the general superintendence of all courts of inferior 
jurisdiction to prevent and correct errors and abuses therein where no other 
remedy is expressly provided by law.”

 it must enter an appealable final judgment.  Bailey, 135 Hawai i 
at 492, 353 P.3d at 1034. 
To more fully address the concerns we expressed in Bailey, 
and consistent with a post- Jenkins amendment to HRS 641-1(a) 
making civil appeals subject to HRS Chapter 602, as discussed 
below, we  also prospectively hold that when a party to a circuit 
court civil case appeals what is purported to be a final and 
appealable judgment, but the judgment does not meet Jenkins 
requirements, rather than dismiss the appeal, the ICA must 
temporarily remand the case “in aid of its jurisdiction” for 
entry of an appealable final judgment pursuant to HR S § 602-
57(3), with a direction to the circuit court to supplement the 
record on appeal with the final judgment.   
This holding is consistent with our recent opinion in  
Waikiki, in which we held  that under  the circumstances of that 
case, the ICA should have exercised its authority under HRS § 
602-57(3) to temporarily remand the case to the circuit court 
for entry of an appealable final judgment instead of dismissing 
the appeal.  Waikiki , 140 Hawaii at 204, 398 P.3d at 793.  In 
Waikiki, the ICA had actually followed our precedent by 
dismissing for lack of appellate jurisdiction because the final 
11judgment failed to meet Jenkins requirements.   Without further

 explanation as to why remand should have been ordered, we cited 
to HRS § 602- 57(3) and held the ICA, under the circumstances of 
that case, should have temporarily remanded the case for entry 
of an appealable final judgment rather than dismiss the appeal. 
 In this regard, although not discussed in Waikiki, we note 
the statute governing civil appeals to the ICA from final 
judgments, HRS § 641- 1(a), differed at the time of Jenkins from 
the version applicable in  Waikiki.  The relevant change from the 
1993 version applicable in Jenkins and the version governing 
Waikiki, which is still in effect, is noted with the addition 
underlined:  “Appeals shall be allowed in civil matters from all 
final judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit . . . courts . . 
. subject to chapter 602 .”  The additional language took effect 
in 2004.  2004 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 202, § 66 at 943.  
Thus, since 2004, HRS § 641-1(a) has become subject to HRS 
Chapter 602.  HRS § 602-57(3), which we cited in Waikiki as 
authority for the ICA to remand instead of dismiss, provides,   
“[T]he intermediate appellate court shall have 
jurisdiction . . . [t]o make or issue any order or writ 
necessary or appropriate in the aid of its jurisdiction, and in 
such case, any judge may issue a writ or an order to show cause 
returnable before the court.”   
 Pursuant to Hawai‘i Constitution article VI, section 1, 
appellate jurisdiction is governed by law.  After the 2004 ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   ***  
 
17 
 amendment, appeals of civil matters to the ICA are now “subject 
to” HRS Chapter 602.  HRS § 602 -57(3), which is within HRS 
Chapter 602, expressly permits the ICA “[t] o make or issue any 
order or writ necessary or appropriate in the aid of its 
jurisdiction.”   
 As noted, “[t]he policy of this court has always been to 
permit litigants, where possible, to appeal and hear the case on 
its merits.”  Jones v. Dicker , 39 Haw. 208, 209 (Haw. Terr. 
1952).  Dismi ssal of appeals for lack of appellate jurisdiction 
because a purportedly appealable final judgment fails to meet 
Jenkins requirements has required litigants to bear unnecessary 
expense and delay in havi ng their appeals addressed on the 
merits.  As in this case, after dismissals of appeals on this 
basis, parties have incurred time and expense to file motions to 
have the circuit court correct errors in the previous 
purportedly appealable final judgment.  In this case, Joshua was 
granted in forma pauperis status and did not incur appellate 
filing fees for her first two appeals.  She did, however, pay 
for her third appeal.  Many appellants do not qualify for in 
forma pauperis status, subjecting them to multiple appellate 
filing fees when appeals are dismissed due to the failure of a 
purported final judgment to meet Jenkins requirements.  
Moreover, in most cases, the party seeking to appeal is not even 
responsible for deficiencies in the final judgment, as Rule 23 ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   ***  
 
18 
 of the Rules of the Circuit Courts of the State of Hawai i 
(“RCCSH”) (2010) requires the prevailing party to prepare and 
submit the proposed form of judgment to the circuit court.12  
Therefore, our prospective rule is in the interests of access to 
justice.  
Finally, the prospective rule is also consistent with HRAP 
Rule 4(a)(2)(2016), which provides  that “[i] f a notice of appeal 
is filed after announcement of a decision but before entry of 
the judgment or order, such notice shall be considered as filed 
immediately after the time the judgment or order becomes final 
for the purpose of appeal.”  An appeal of a defective final 
judgment is tantamount to a premature notice of appeal awaiting 
                         
12  RCCSH Rule 23 provides, in relevant part:  
 
  Rule 23.  SETTLEMENT OF JUDGMENTS, DECREES, AND ORDERS.  
      (a) Preparation.  Within 10 days after a decision of 
the court awarding any judgment, decree, or order, 
including any interlocutory order, the prevailing party, 
unless otherwise ordered by the court, shall prepare a 
judgment, decree, or order in accordance with the decision, 
attempt to secure approval as to form from all other 
parties, and following such approval deliver the original 
and 1 copy to the court.  
      (b) Party Approval or Objection to Form; Delivery to 
Court.  If there is no objection to the form of a proposed 
judgment, decree, or order, the other parties shall 
promptly approve as to form.  If a proposed judgment, 
decree, or order is not approved as to form by the other 
parties within 5 days after a written request for approval, 
the drafting party shall deliver the original and 1 copy to 
the court along with notice of service on all parties and 
serve a copy thereof upon each party who has appeared in 
the action. . . .  
      . . . .  
(e)  Request for Entry.   If the drafting party fails 
to timely submit a proposed judgment, decree, or order to 
the court, any other party may present a proposed judgment, 
decree, or order to the court for approval and entry.

 entry of an appealable final judgment under HRAP Rule 4(a)(2).  
Requiring a temporary remand for entry of an appealable judgment 
to effectuate the appeal is consistent with the intent of HRAP 
Rule 4(a)(2).13    
For all of these reasons, we prospectively hold that when a 
party to a circuit court civil case timely appeals a purported 
final judgment that does not meet Jenkins requirements,  the ICA 
must temporarily remand the case “in aid of its jurisdiction” 
pursuant to HRS § 602-57(3) f or entry of an appealable final 
judgment, with a direction to the circuit court to supplement 
14the record on appeal with the final judgment.  HRAP Rule 42(b) 
(2016) governs if the parties reach a settlement after remand 
for entry of a final judgment. 
 
 
                         
13  HRAP Rule 4(a)(2) is based on Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 
4(a)(2).  A ccording to the Ninth Circuit  Court of Appeals, a premature notice 
of appeal is valid only when all that remains is the ministerial task of 
entering the final judgment (or appealable order).  In Re Jack Raley Const., 
Inc., 17 F.3d 291, 294 (9th Cir. 1994) (citing American Totalisator Co. v . 
Fair Grounds Corp., 3 F.3d 810, 813 (5th Cir. 1993)).  We applied HRAP Rule 
4(a)(2) in  Cho v. State , 115 Hawai i 373, 168 P.3d 17 (2007), in which we held 
a notice of appeal was eff ective when the circuit court’s appealable judgment 
was filed two days after the premature notice of appeal.  Cho, 115 Hawai i at 
380, 168 P.3d at 24.  If an appeal has been dismissed before entry of the 
appealable judgment or order, however, a timely appeal of the appealable 
judgment or order is required to trigger appellate jurisdiction.    
 
14  Although the ICA has discretion to  apply HRS § 602-57(3) in other 
contexts in which appellate jurisdiction could exist based on entry of a 
document triggering appellate jurisdiction, we do not expand the requirement 
of remand to other contexts  at this time, since this  could implicate  one of 
the concerns leading to our holding in Jenkins :  the burden on appellate 
courts of “searching a voluminous record for evidence of finality” or other 
grounds for appealability.  Jenkins, 76 Hawai i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338.  ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   ***

 V.  Conclusion  
In this case, Joshua’s November 9, 2016 third notice of 
appeal was not a timely appeal from the circuit court’s October 
6, 2016 appealable second amended final judgment.  Thus, the ICA 
did not err in ruling that it lacks appellate jurisdiction over 
Joshua’s appeal. We therefore affirm the ICA’s Judgment on 
Appeal dismissing Joshua’s untimely November 9, 2016 notice of 
appeal.
