OPINION OF THE COURT BY WILSON, J. 
 
I. Introduction 
This case arises from the arrest and conviction of 
Petitioner/Defendant- Appellant  Mark Edward Means (“Means”)  for 
theft in the second degree by Shoplifting.  The Circuit Court of Electronically Filed

 the Second Circuit (“circuit court”)  sentenced Means as a repeat 
offender to a mandatory minimum of five years’ incarceration 
without the possibility of parole.   In sentencing Means to a 
mandatory minimum as a repeat offender, the circuit court did 
not require a jury to find that Means qualified as a repeat 
offender beyond a reasonable doubt as required by State v. Auld, 
136 Hawai ʻi 244, 
361 P.3d 471 (2015).  The Intermediate Court of 
Appeals (“ICA”) affirmed the conviction and sentence in a 
Summary Disposition Order (“SDO”).   
In Auld, this court  held “that a jury is required to 
find that the defendant’s prior conviction(s) have been proved 
beyond a reasonable doubt to trigger the imposition of a 
mandatory minimum sentence under [HRS § 706- 606.5].”  Id. at 
257, 361 P.3d at 484.  Although Auld was given “prospective 
effect only,” it was published one day before Means was 
convicted and nearly a year before he was sentenced as a repeat 
offender.  Id.  Therefore,  pursuant to Auld, Means’ sentence 
violated his right to a jury determination as to whether he 
qualified to be sentenced as a repeat offender pursuant to  
HRS § 706-606.5 .   
Accordingly, the ICA’s December 1 3, 2018 Judgment on 
Appeal is vacated, the circuit court’s October 21, 2016 sentence 
is vacated, and Means’ case is remanded to the circuit court for 
resentencing in conformance with 
Auld. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 II. Background 
A. Circuit Court Proceedings 
On September 8, 2015, Means was charged by felony 
information with the offense of theft in the second degree by 
Shoplifting, in violation of Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes ( “HRS”)  
§ 708-831(1)(b).1  The incident  took place on September 2, 2015 
at the Sears department store in Queen Ka ʻahumanu Mall on Maui, 
and involved the theft of a tent, a tool set, and a multimeter2 
with a total aggregated value exceeding $300.00.     
1. Trial 
At trial, the State presented testimony from Arthur 
Wake (“Wake”), an asset protection manager at the Sears  
department store in Queen Ka ʻahumanu Mall on Maui and from 
                     
1  At the time, HRS § 708 -831(1)(b) (2014) provided:  
 
(1)  A person commits the offense of theft in the second degree 
if the person commits theft: . . .  
 
(b)  Of property or services the value of which exceeds 
$300 . . . .  
 
HRS § 708 -833.5 (2014) provided:  
 
A person convicted of committing the offense of shoplifting as 
defined in section 708 -830 shall be sentenced as follows:  
 
(1) In cases involving property the value or aggregate 
value of which exceeds $300; as a class C felony, provided 
that the minimum fine shall be four times the value or 
aggregate value involved . . . .  
 
2 A multimeter is a device used to find the voltage in a circuit.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 Officer Ashley Gandau li of the Maui Police Department (“MPD”) , 
among others.3   
Wake testified that he observed Means on
 Sears’ 
security cameras as Means carried various items, including a 
Northwoods brand tent and a DeWalt brand tool set, toward Sears’ 
automotive exit
.  Wake positioned himself outside the store’s 
automotive exit and intercepted Means when he walked out.  Wake 
testified that he identified himself to Means as Sears asset 
protection and asked for the items back.  Means put the items on 
the ground and began to walk away.  Wake called the Maui Police 
Department (“
MPD”), told them what had happened, and gave them a 
description of Means and the direction he was going.   
Wake testified that he sub
sequently returned to the 
automotive exit of Sears and recovered the items that Means left 
on the ground.  He took a photograph of the items;  that 
photograph, showing the tent, the multimeter, and the tool set, 
was admitted into evidence.  The items in the photograph do not 
bear any tags or labels indicating their value.  The tool set 
and the multimeter were covered in security devices called 
                     
3 The Honorable Joseph E. Cardoza presided.  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 “spider wrap” that Wake testified is standard for Sears 
merchandise priced $99.99 and above.4     
Wake worked with another Sears employee to produce a 
receipt to show the prices of the items.  He identified State’s 
Exhibit No. 4 as the receipt that was made for the MPD officers; 
the receipt lists the prices of the tool set, the multimeter, 
and the camping tent.  Wake testified that the receipt was “a 
true and accurate receipt for those items[,]” but that he was 
not the person who generated the receipt.  Ins tead, a “hub 
associate[,]” who Wake did not know,5 rang up the merchandise 
because asset protection is not allowed to touch the registers.6   
Defense counsel objected to the receipt being entered 
into evidence, arguing that it had not been properly 
authenticated due to the fact that Wake had no knowledge of the 
system and the person who rang up the items was unknown.  
Defense counsel also argued the receipt was inadmissible 
hearsay 
evidence.   
                     
4 Spider wrap consists of a noise -making device and some wire; if 
the wire is pulled on or cut, an alarm will go off on the device.  When an 
item is purchased, the spider wrap is deactivated and removed by a sales 
associate.   
 
5 Wake testified that he could  identify the associate by looking up 
the “associate number” on the receipt.   
 
6 Wake testified that although he had “very little experience” with 
the registers, he did have some because he had previously been an electronics 
associate for about three months.   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 The court allowed the prosecutor to supplement the 
foundation for introduction of the receipt 
by having Wake 
provide further testimony regarding the process used to produce 
the receipt.  Wake testified that in order to produce a receipt, 
he called his “ASM,” who is a manager, to the hub office, and 
the manager produce
d the receipt by scanning the merchandise at 
an office register used for complex returns and for generating 
receipts after theft incidents.  Wake testified that he was 
personally present at the time the receipt was produced.7   
Defense counsel renewed his objection to admitting the 
receipt.  The court indicated that in order for the receipt to 
be admissible, it would be helpful to have testimony that the 
prices on the receipt were accurate.  
 
Wake testified that he knew the retail price of the 
items because he viewed the receipt and also because he had a 
“rough idea” of their cost from walking around the floor of the 
store and viewing the posted prices.  The prosecutor next asked 
him: “on September 2nd, 2015, what was the posted -- price that 
was posted near or on these items?”  Although the defense 
objected to the question, the objection was overruled and Wake 
responded that the tool set cost $219.99, the multimeter cost 
                     
7   Although Wake described the person who produced the receipt as 
an “associate,” a “manager,” and an “ASM,” the record indicates that Wake 
used these three terms interchangeably to refer to the same person.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
7 
 $169.99, and the tent cost $129.99.  He testified again that the 
receipt was produced by 
a manager, who scanned the items at the 
register in the hub location, that the manager would be trained 
in the procedures of producing a receipt according to Sears’ 
protocol and the manufacturer’s specifications, and that he 
personally witnessed the manager produce the receipt.  The 
prosecution asked to submit the receipt into evidence.  Defense 
counsel again objected, and  the court overruled  the objection 
and admitted the receipt.   
Wake identified the three items on the receipt and 
again listed their prices:   $129.99 for the tent, $169.99 for 
the multimeter, and $219.99 for the tool set, for a total of 
$519.97.  He testified that the sales price for the tent was 
posted directly below the tent and that the price for the tool 
set was posted below the tool set.8   
Ashley Gandauli
 (“Officer Gandauli”) , a patrol officer 
with the MPD, also testified for the prosecution.  Officer 
Gandauli testified that she received a call from dispatch about 
a theft in progress incident in the area of Sears and was 
subsequently able to locate and detain Means.   
                     
8 Wake testified that the tent would have been on a shelf with 
other tents of the same type and price, and different tents that might have 
been different prices would have been on different shelves.  Wake noted, 
however, that he did not personally know where the tent Means took was 
located before Means picked it up.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
8 
 On cross- examination, defense counsel asked Officer 
Gandauli whether she had made a notation of any address for 
Means in her report.  The prosecution objected that the question 
did not call for relevant evidence; at a bench conference, the 
prosecutor argued that the defense was getting into character 
evidence and that if they  brought in evidence that Means was 
homeless, it would open the door for the State to bring in 
evidence that he was homeless and unemployed “and all of these 
other things about his background and character.”   The court 
stated that the information about Means “may relate to his 
ability to have intended to pay for the merchandise.”  Defense 
counsel stated that he would not  ask if Means was homeless and 
would limit his questions to whether Officer Gandauli noted an 
address or that Means was unemployed on the police report, which 
would limit the evidence to what was in the report.  The court 
allowed the questions.   
Defense counsel then asked Officer Gandauli if she 
entered an address on the police report.  Officer Gandauli said 
she did not.  Defense counsel asked her, “[w]hy was that?” and 
Officer Gandauli said, “ [h]e stated that he was homeless; that 
he did not have a local address.”   Defense counsel told the 
court he “didn’t ask for that, but now it’s out.”  The court 
said defense counsel did ask for it because he asked the officer *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
9 
 why she didn’t enter an address.  D efense counsel stated he had 
no objection to the answer and that “I 
am quite happy” with it.   
2. Closing Arguments and Verdict  
During the defense’s closing argument, defense counsel 
argued that Means was guilty of shoplifting, but that he did not 
have the requisite state of mind to be found guilty of theft in 
the second degree because he did not know that the aggregate 
value of the items was greater than $300.9  During closing 
arguments, Defense counsel made two references to the fact that 
Means was homeless.  Near the beginning of his argument, defense 
counsel said, “[d]uri ng the trial, we saw several things, we 
learned several things.  We learned Mark is homeless.”  Later in 
the closing argument, defense counsel referenced Means’ 
homelessness again: 
 Mark’s not an electronic calculator, and he’s not a 
cash register.  He’s a  homeless man who, apparently, went 
into Sears seeking shelter --
 
 
 [Prosecutor]:  Objection, Your Honor.  Not 
substantiated by the evidence.   
 
 THE COURT:  The objection is sustained.  
 
 [Defense Counsel]:  Mark is a homeless man that is 
clearly taking a  tent for whatever purpose he would -- a 
homeless person would take a tent.  
 
 There is no -- it’s very doubtful that Mark actually 
knew the aggregate value of the three items that he 
                     
9 “[I]n order to convict a defendant of theft in the second degree, 
in violation of HRS §§ 708 –830(8)(a) and 708 –831(1)(b), the prosecution must 
prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused intended to steal property 
or services valued in excess of $300.00. ”  State v. Cabrera, 90 Hawaiʻi 359, 
369, 978 P.2d 797, 807 (1999) . *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
10 
 selected, and then later, as eloquently pointed out by the 
officer, desel
ected when he was confronted by Sears 
security.  That’s in doubt.  That’s in reasonable doubt.  
 
Defense counsel argued that Means did not know that the value of 
the items he took was over $300, but that it was reasonable to 
assume he knew the value of the items were over $100.  
Accordingly, the defense asked that the jury to find Means 
guilty of theft in the third degree ,10 rather than theft in the 
second degree, because Means did not know that he was stealing 
property in excess of $300.    
On November 25, 2015, Means was found guilty as 
charged of theft in the second degree.   
3. Following the Publication of State v.  Auld on  
November 24, 2015, Prior Convictions Must be 
Proved to a Jury Beyond a Reasonable Doubt in 
Order to Sentence a Defendant as a Repeat 
Offender.  
The Hawai ‘i Supreme
 Court published its opinion in 
State v. Auld on November 24, 2015, while Means ’ jury trial was 
ongoing but before he was convicted.  Auld, 136 Hawai‘ i 244, 361 
P.3d 471.  Auld held that “the State, in seeking to sentence a 
defendant to a mandatory minimum sentence as a repeat offender 
                     
10  At the time, HRS § 708 -832(1)(a) (2014) provided:  
 
(1)  A person commits the offense of theft in the third degree if 
the person commits theft:  
 
(a)  Of property or services the value of which exceeds 
$100 . . . .  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
11 
 under [HRS § 706-606.5], (1) must include the defendant’s 
predicate prior convictions in a charging instrum
ent; and (2) 
must prove these prior convictions to a jury, beyond a 
reasonable doubt.”  Id. at 246-47, 361 P.3d at  473-74.  Because 
the Auld court found that repeat offender sentencing under HRS § 
706-606.5 enhances the penalty of the crime committed, the court 
held that the prior convictions upon which a defendant’s 
increased mandatory minimum sentence is predicated (referred to 
as “predicate prior convictions” by the Auld court) must be 
alleged in the charging instrument and found by a jury beyond a 
reasonable doubt.  Id. at 247-48, 361 P.3d at 474 -75.  
The holding in Auld  was given “prospective effect 
only[,]”  meaning that the “rule is applied neither to the 
parties in the law- making decision nor to those others against 
or by whom it might be applied to conduct or events occurring 
before that decision[.]”   Id. at 255-57, 361 P.3d at 482-84. 
4. Sentencing  
On February 10, 2016, the State filed a motion for 
imposition of a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of five 
years without the possibility of parole, pursuant to HRS § 706
-
606.5.  At the time, HRS § 706- 606.5(1)(c)(iv) (2014) provided 
that a person convicted of theft in the second degree who had 
three or more felony convictions in this or another jurisdiction *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
12 
 was to be sentenced to a mandatory minimum of five years 
imprisonment.11   
In a declaration attached to the motion for imposition 
of mandatory minimum term of imprisonment, the prosecutor 
asserted that Means had been previously convicted in Florida of 
Grand Theft (Motor Vehicle), Burglary of a Structure, and Grand 
Theft, all three of which are felonies under Florida law.  
The 
State argued that it was the court, rather than the jury, that 
was required to determine whether Means was subject to mandatory 
minimum sentencing as a repeat offender.  The State’s 
                     
11  HRS § 706 -606.5 (2014) provides in relevant part:    
(1) Notwithstanding section 706 -669 and any other law to the 
contrary, any person convi
cted of . . .  any of the following 
class C felonies:  
 
. . . . 
 
Section 708 -831 relating to theft in the second degree;  
 
. . . . 
 
and who has a prior conviction or prior convictions for the 
following felonies, including  . . . any of the class C felony 
offenses enumerated above, or any felony convictions of another 
jurisdiction, shall be sentenced to a mandatory minimum period of 
imprisonment without possibility of parole during such period as 
follows: 
 
. . . . 
 
(c) Three  or more prior felony convictions:  
 
. . . 
 
(iv) Where the instant conviction is for a class C 
felony offense enumerated above 
-- five years.  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
13 
 declaration noted that this court’s decision in  Auld—which 
required a jury to find whether  a defendant has prior 
convictions that would trigger the imposition of a mandatory 
minimum sentence as a repeat offender —had been published on 
November 24, 2015, after Means’ case was charged, and after the 
jury had been sworn and witness testimony had begun.  The State 
argued that Auld did not apply to Means ’ case because “Auld’s 
holding has ‘purely prospective effect,’ meaning ‘the rule is 
applied neither to the parties in the law- making decision [i.e., 
the defendant Auld] nor to those others against or by whom it 
might be applied to conduct or events occurring before that 
decision[.]’”     
In opposition, Means argued that , under Auld, the jury 
must find the facts necessary to show that he was subject to 
repeat offender sentencing under HRS § 706- 606.5.  Means noted 
that the jury in this case was empaneled on November 23, 2015, 
was still empaneled on November 24, 2015, when Auld  was 
published, and was not excused until after it reached a verdict 
on November 25, 2015.  Means argued that there was therefore 
ample opportunity for the court to have the jury decide the fact 
of his predicate prior convictions before the jury was excused.  
Separately, Means filed a “motion/demand” that a jury be 
empaneled to decide the issue of predicate prior convictions.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
14 
 The State submitted its  memorandum in opposition to 
Means’ motion/demand  that a ju ry be empaneled in which it argued 
that Means’ claim that he could still be given a jury trial on 
the issue of his prior qualifying felonies “fl[ew] in the face” 
of the Supreme C ourt’s statement that Auld would have purely 
prospective effect.  The State ar gued that Auld’s prospective 
application did not apply to Means because Means had committed 
the offense and been charged, the trial had commenced, and the 
jury had already been sworn prior to the date Auld was 
published.   
Means filed a repl y, arguing that Auld did apply to 
his sentencing because the sentencing proceedings, as well as 
his demand that a jury decide the issue of predicate prior 
convictions,  were an “event” that occurred after Auld was 
decided.   
At the hearing on Means’ motion/demand that a jury be 
empaneled to establish his prior convictions, the circuit court 
stated that Auld “does not trigger [the] requirement that the 
defendant be entitled to a trial by jury or a charge given the 
chronology of the --  of this case [.]”  The circuit court *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
15 
 subsequently denied Means’ motion without providing any fur ther 
reasoning.12   
At a sentencing hearing on October 21, 2016, the 
circuit court found that Means had been convicted of three prior 
felonies and concluded that Means was a repeat offender as 
defined by HRS § 706-606.5 and subject to the mandatory minimum 
for a person having three prior convictions.  Means was 
sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of five 
years without possibility of parole, with credit for time 
served, plus payment of
 a crime victim compensation fee and a 
fine of $2,079.88.  Means appealed his conviction to the ICA. 
B. ICA Appeal 
On appeal, Means argued:  (1) that he was denied 
effective assistance of counsel because his attorney introduced 
evidence that he was homeless and unemployed at the time of the 
incident; (2) that the circuit court erred in allowing Wake to 
testify to the value of the stolen items and in admitting into 
evidence a receipt showing the value of such items; and (3) that 
the circuit court “erred in fail ing to submit the proof of prior 
convictions to a jury pursuant to State v. Auld .”  The ICA 
affirmed Means’ conviction and sentence.  State v. Means, No. 
                     
12  Means subsequently filed a new memorandum in opposition to the 
State’s motion for imposition of a mandatory mi nimum term, but his arguments 
were based on the legal representation he received in his prior Florida cases 
and on claimed mitigating circumstances, not on Auld.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
16 
 CAAP-16- 0000810, 2018 WL 5839546, at *2 (App. Nov. 8, 2018) 
(SDO).  The ICA held, inter alia, that (1) Means was not 
deprived effective assistance of counsel; (2) that the circuit 
court did not err in receiving into evidence the receipt that 
Wake produced; and (3) that Auld ’s requirement that the State 
prove the fact of prior convictions to a jury beyond a 
reasonable doubt did not apply in Means’ case because “Means’ 
Felony Information was filed on September 8, 2015, more than two 
months before Auld was issued.”  Id. at *5.  
III.  Standards of Review  
A. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel 
  If the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel is 
first raised on appeal, the appellate court may consider the 
merits of the appeal de novo if the record “is sufficiently 
developed to determine whether there has been ineffective 
assistance of counsel[ .]”  State v. Silva, 75 Haw . 419, 439, 864 
P.2d 583, 592 (1993).   
B. Admissibility of Evidence 
“When a question arises regarding the necessary 
foundation for the introduction of evidence, the determination 
of whether proper foundation has been established lies within 
the discretion of the trial court, and its determination will 
not be overturned absent a showing of clear abuse.”  State v. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
17 
 Villena, 140 
Hawaiʻi 370, 376, 400 P.3d 571, 577 (2017) (quoting 
State v. Eid, 126 Hawai ʻi 430, 440, 272 P.3d 1197, 1207 (2012)). 
“We review the admissibility of evidence pursuant to 
[Hawai‘i Rules of Evidence (“ HRE”)] Rule 803 under the 
right/wrong standard, because the requirements of the rules 
dealing with hearsay are such that application of the particular 
rules can yield only one correct result.”  State v. Wakisaka, 
102 Hawaiʻ i 504, 514, 78 P.3d 317, 327 (2003) (quoting State v. 
Yamada, 99 Hawaiʻi 542, 550, 57 P.3d 467, 475 (2002) (internal 
quotation marks and brackets omitted)). 
C. Constitutional Questions 
“We answer questions of constitutional law by 
exercising our own independent constitutional judgement based on 
the facts of the case.  Thus, we review questions of 
constitutional law under the right/wrong standard.”  State v. 
Pratt, 127 Hawai ‘i 206, 212,  277 P.3d 300, 306 (2012).  
IV. Discussion 
A. Means Was Not Denied His Constitutional Right To 
Effective Assistance Of Counsel When His Trial Counsel 
Adduced Evidence That He Was Homeless And Unemployed At The 
Time Of The Incident. 
Means’ contention that he was deprived of his 
constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel because 
his trial counsel adduced evidence that he was homeless and 
unemployed at the time of the theft is unpersuasive .  The *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
18 
 decision to adduce evid
ence of his homelessness and unemployment 
was part of a trial strategy that had an obvious basis for 
benefitting the defense.   
The right to the effective assistance of counsel in a 
criminal case is guaranteed under article I, section 14 of the 
Hawai’i Constitution and the 
Sixth Amendment to the United States 
Constitution.  This court has articulated the test for the 
constitutional adequacy of defense counsel’s assistance  as 
follows: 
 When reviewing a claim of ineffective assistance of 
counsel, this court looks at whether defense counsel ’s 
assistance was within the range of competence demanded of 
attorneys in criminal cases.  The defendant has the burden 
of establishing ineffective assistance of counsel and must 
meet the following two -part test: 1) that there were 
specific errors or omissions reflecting counsel ’s lack of 
skill, judgment, or diligence; and 2) that such errors or 
omissions resulted in either the withdrawal or substantial 
impairment of a potentially meritorious defense.  To 
satisfy this second prong, the defendant needs to show a 
possible impairment, rather than a probable impairment, of 
a potentially meritorious defense.  A defendant need not 
prove actual prejudice.  
 
Wakisaka, 102 Hawai ʻi at 513
–14, 78 P.3d at 326–27 (internal 
quotation marks, citations, and footnote omitted).  Thus, in 
order to prove a violation of this right, the defendant bears 
the burden of proof on two elements:  “1) that there were 
specific errors or omissions reflecting counsel ’s lack of skill, 
judgment, or diligence; and 2) that such errors or omissions 
resulted in either the withdrawal or substantial impairment of a 
potentially meritorious defense.”  Id. at 514, 78 P.3d at 327.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

WL 3397791, at *10 (Haw. June 19, 2020).   
Here, the transcript of defense counsel’s cross -
examination of Officer Gandauli reflects that the evidence of 
Means’ homelessness and unemployment was  adduced by defense 
counsel as part of a trial strategy that had an obvious basis 
for benefitting Means’ defense .  Defense counsel asked Officer 
Gandauli whether she entered an address for Means’ residence on 
the police form, and when she responded that she did not, 
defense counsel asked her “why?”  Officer Gandauli responded, 
“[h]e stated that he was homeless; that he did not have a local 
address.”  The court asked defense counsel if he intended to 
object to that answer, to which defense counsel responded that 
he did not have an objection to Officer Gandauli’s  response, and 
that he was actually “quite happy” with it.  Defense counsel 
clearly intended to elicit testimony that Means was homeless, in *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 an apparent effort to show that Means lacked the intent to 
commit theft in the second degree because he did not know that 
the items he took from Sears were valued in excess of $300.   
A conviction of theft in the second degree pursuant to 
HRS § 708-831(1)(b) (2014) requires that the defendant 
intentionally or knowingly commit theft of proper
ty valued in 
excess of $300.  See State v. Mitchell, 88 Hawai ‘i 
216, 223, 965 
P.2d 149, 156 (1998) (noting that “[i]n order to establish a 
defendant’s culpability for second degree theft, therefore, the 
State must prove that a defendant intended to steal the 
statutorily defined value, in this case $300”).  
During closing argument, defense counsel twice 
referenced the fact that Means was homeless and told the jury 
that Means was not “an electronic calculator” or “a cash 
register” and that he “clearly” took the tent “for whatever 
purpose . . . a homeless person would take a tent.”  Arguing 
that Means knew the items were worth over $100, but not over 
$300, defense counsel asked the jury to return a verdict of 
guilty of third degree shoplifting.   
Defense counse l’s overall strategy is evident from the 
record.  Given the strength of the evidence against Means, 
defense counsel
’s decision to elicit testimony about Means’ 
homelessness, in an effort to paint Means in a sympathetic light 
and portray him as someone who was seeking shelter and who would *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 not have considered (or been aware of) the value of the tent and 
other items that he took,  had an obvious tactical basis for 
benefitting Means’ defense  and counsel’s decision to adduce this 
evidence will accordingly not be subject to further scrutiny.

B. The Receipt Was Admissible Evidence Because The 
Prosecution Laid The Proper Foundation For Admission And It 
Qualified For Admission Under The Business Records 
Exception To The Hearsay Rule. 
Means argues that the circuit court abused its 
discretion when it admitted into evidence the receipt that Wake 
produced.  HRS § 708- 830(8) provides that in shoplifting cases, 
“printed register receipts shall be prima facie evid ence of 
value and ownership of such goods or merchandise.”13  Although 
“printed register receipts” are prima facie evidence of value, 
the evidence must still be admissible under the
 Hawaiʻi Rules of 
Evidence. 
In order to be admissible, documentary evidence such 
as a printed register receipt must
 be authenticated or 
identified “by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the 
matter in question is what its proponent claims.”  HRE Rule 901.  
In this case, Wake authenticated the receipt by providing 
                     
13 Pursuant to HRE Rule 305, “[a] statute providing that a fact or a 
group of facts is prima facie evidence of another fact establishes a 
presumption within the meaning of this article unless the statute expressly 
provides that such prima facie evidence is conclusive.”  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
22 
 testimony sufficient to support a finding that it was, as the 
prosecution claimed, a receipt listing the prices of the three 
items shoplifted by Means.14  Wake’s testimony was sufficient to 
authenticate the receipt because it was “sufficient proof . . . 
so that a reasonable juror could find in favor of authenticity 
or identification.”  State v. Loa , 83 Hawai ʻi 335, 350, 926 P.2d 
1258, 1273 (1996) (quoting State v. Joseph, 77 Hawaiʻi 235, 239 
883 P.2d 657, 661 (App. 1994)).   
Evidence, even if properly authenticated, cannot be 
admitted if it is hearsay.  HRE Rule 802.  Hearsay is defined as 
“a statement, other than one made by the declarant while 
testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove 
the truth of the matter asserted.”  HRE Rule 801.  “[A]n 
assertion in writing” is a statement for hearsay purposes.  Id.  
The receipt met the definition of hearsay because it was an out-  
of-court statement asserting the prices of the items, offered to 
prove the truth of the matter asserted. 
The receipt qualified for admission as a hearsay 
statement under HRE Rule 803(b)(6) as a business record: 
                     
14  Wake personally identified the receipt and testified that:  it 
was a true and accurate receipt for the items; an associate or manager who 
was trained to produce receipts produced the receipt by scanning the items at 
an office register as he watched; he also had personal experience and some 
training on using the registers because he was briefly employed an 
electronics associate; and the person who produced the receipt followed the 
same procedure that Wake had been trained to use.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
23  
(continued . . .)  
  The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule, 
even though the declarant is available as a witness:  
 
. . . . 
 
 Records of regularly  conducted activity.  A 
memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, in any 
form, of acts, events, conditions, opinions, or diagnoses, 
made in the course of a regularly conducted activity, at or 
near the time of the acts, events, conditions, opinions, 
or 
diagnoses, as shown by the testimony of the custodian or 
other qualified witness, or by certification that complies 
with rule 902(11) or a statute permitting certification, 
unless the sources of information or other circumstances 
indicate lack of trustworthiness.  
 
HRE Rule 803(b)(6).  The receipt was a “record” of “conditions” 
(the prices of the items on September 2, 2015) made in the 
course of “a regularly conducted activity[,]”15 “at or near the 
time” of the “events[,]”16 as shown by the testimony of a 
“qualified witness” (Wake).  Id.   
Moreover, once admissible under an exception to the 
rule against hearsay, a printed register receipt is prima facie 
evidence of value or ownership in shoplifting cases pursuant to 
HRS § 708-830(8).  2001 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 87, § 1 at 138.17  
                     
15   Wake testified that the office register was regularly used for 
generating receipts for theft incidents.   
 
16   The receipt was produced on September 2, 2015, the same day as 
the theft. 
 
17   Act 87, HRS § 708 -830(8) (2001) provided:   
 
 The unaltered price or name tag or other marking on 
goods or merchandise, or duly identified photographs or 
photocopies thereof, or printed register receipts, shall be 
prima facie evidence of value and ownership of such goods 
or merchandise.  Photographs of the goods or merchandise 
involved, duly identified in writing by the arresting 
police officer as accurately representing such goods or 
merchandise, shall be deemed competent evidence of the *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
24 (continued . . .)  
 The legislative history establishes  that, so long as it is 
properly admitted, a printed register receipt is evidence of the 
value of merchandise.  See  H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1519, in 
2001 House Journal, at 1693 (“The statutory require ment for 
proof of value in theft cases has not kept pace with the 
technology of recordkeeping of prices for merchandise stock.  
With proper evidentiary foundation, photocopies of price tags 
and printed register receipts are reliable evidence of 
value[.]”).   
The legislature established that printed record 
receipts constitute prima facie evidence of value or ownership 
when the receipt is properly admitted as evidence.   Here, the 
receipt was properly admitted as a business record pursuant to 
HRE Rule 803(b)(6) and accordingly constituted prima facie 
evidence of the value and ownership of the items stolen from 
Sears in this incident.18  
                     
(continued . . .) 
 
goods or merchandise involved and shall be admissible in 
any proceedings, hearings, and trials for shoplifting, to 
the same extent as the goods or merchandise themselves.  
 
18  Prior to the receipt being admitted into evidence, the State 
attempted to establish the prices of the items through the testimony of Wake.  
In doing so, the State repeatedly asked Wake about the prices for the items 
taken by Means.  The defense made repeated hearsay objections, arguing that 
Wake was not testifying from his personal knowledge.  As noted, the receipt 
was properly admitted to establish the value of the items stolen.  Thus, any 
error arising from the improper admission of Wake’s testimony, was harmless.

 C. Means Was Entitled To A Jury Determination As To 
Whether His Prior Convictions Supported The Imposition Of A 
Mandatory Minimum Sentence As A Repeat Offender. 
In his final point of error, Means correctly contends 
that the circuit court erred in sentencing him as a repeat 
offender without requiring the State to prove the proffered
 
predicate prior convictions to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.  
Auld identified two separate requirements to establish mandatory 
minimum sentencing of repeat offenders:  “the State, in seeking 
to sentence a defendant to a mandatory minimum sentence as a 
repeat offender under [HRS § 706- 606.5], (1) must include the 
defendant’s predicate prior convictions in a charging 
instrument; and (2) must prove these prior convictions to a 
jury, beyond a reasonable doubt.”  136 Hawai ʻi at 246-
47, 361 
P.3d at 473-74.  Here, Means argues that he was improperly 
denied the protections of Auld 
mandating “that a jury is 
required to find that the defendant’s prior conviction(s) have 
been proved beyond a reasonable doubt to trigger the imposition 
of a mandatory minimum sentence under [HRS § 706- 606.5].”  Id. 
The Auld court recognized that its holding announced 
new rules for repeat offender charging and sentencing, and  
                     
(continued . . .) 
 
that “[t]estimony based on information supplied by another person that is not 
in evidence is inadmissible”) .   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
26 
 considered whether the new rules should be given purely 
prospective, limited retroactive, or full retroactive effect: 
[W]e consid
er whether these new rules will be given:  
 
(1) purely prospective effect, which means that the 
rule is applied neither to the parties in the law -
making decision nor to those others against or by 
whom it might be applied to conduct or events 
occurring before that decision; (2) limited or 
“pipeline” retroactive effect, under which the rule 
applies to the parties in the decision and all cases 
that are on direct review or not yet final as of the 
date of the decision; or (3) full retroactive effect, 
under which the rule applies both to the parties 
before the court and to all others by and against 
whom claims may be pressed.  
 
Id. at 255–56, 361 P.3d at 482 –83 (quoting State v. Jess, 117 
Hawaiʻi 381, 401, 184 P.3d 133, 153 (2008)).  After noting that 
Auld expressly overturned prior appellate precedent, this court 
gave the new rules “prospective effect only.”  Id. at 257, 361 
P.3d at 484.  Auld was given prospective-only application 
because it announced new rules that changed how “parties may 
previously have regulated their conduct”:  
The “paradigm case” warranting a prospective -only 
application of a new rule arises “when a court expressly 
overrules a precedent upon which the contest would 
otherwise be decided differently and by which the parties 
may previously have regulated their conduct.  
 
Id. at 256, 361 P.3d at 483 (quoting State v. Jess , 117 Hawai ʻi 
381, 400, 184 P.3d 133, 152 (2008)) .  Thus, t he prospective- only 
application arises when a new rule changes how “parties may 
previously have regulated their conduct.”  Id.   
  The ICA incorrectly concluded that because Means’ 
charging document was filed before November 24, 2015 (the date *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
27 (continued . . .)  of Auld’s publication), Auld’s requirement that a jury decide 
whether prior convictions qualify a defendant for mandatory 
minimum sentencing did not apply to Means.  T he ICA overlooked 
the fact that Auld announced two new requirements, each with its 
own triggering event.  See  Auld, 136 Hawai ‘i at 257, 361 P.3d at 
484. Had Means sought to apply the Auld requirement that the
State must “include the defendant’s predicate prior convictions 
in a charging instrument[,]” the ICA would have been correct to 
determine that the prospective- only application did not apply to 
Means’ case because he was charged (the triggering eve nt) prior 
to the publication of Auld .  Id.  Here, however, Means seeks to 
apply the Auld requirement that the State “prove [the predicate] 
prior convictions to a jury, beyond a reasonable doubt.”  Id.  
Accordingly, because the triggering event for this requirement 
is the start of sentencing proceedings, which in Means’ case did 
not begin until Means was convicted on November 25, 2015, a day 
after Auld was published, a jury finding as to predicate prior 
convictions was required to impose a mandatory minimum sentence 
upon Means.19
19Auld specifically stated: 
As to how repeat offender sentencing procedures would look  
in the future, this court has suggested that information 
pertaining to sentencing may be introduced after the guilt  
phase of the trial has concluded.
  See Jess, 117 Hawai ʻi at 
412, 184 P.3d 
at 164 (citing State v. Janto , 92 Hawai ʻi 19, 
34–35, 986 P.2d 306, 321 –22 (1999) ).  This is apparently *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
28 Auld provides that defendants have a constitutional 
right to have sentencing enhancements (including mandatory 
minimum sentencing based on prior convictions) proven to a jury 
beyond a reasonable doubt so long as that due process does not  
require the court or the parties to revisit already regulated 
“conduct or events. ”  Id. at 255, 361 P.3d at 482.20  Here,
“conduct or events” applies to the beginning of the sentencing 
phase of Means’ trial.  Because the parties in Means’ case had 
not regulated their conduct with respect to sentencing prior to 
the publication of Auld , the “conduct or events” of sentencing 
were prospective.  
(continued . . .) 
the procedure described in [ State v. ]Keohokapu, [127 
Hawaiʻi 91, 276 P.3d 660 (2012)] where the jury heard 
testimony concerning the offenses leading to defendant's 
prior convictions during the extended term sentencing phase
of the trial.   127 Hawai‘i at 96–101, 276 P.3d at 665 –70. 
As with other constitutional rights, the defendant would 
also have the option of waiving a jury trial for repeat 
offender sentencing fact- finding, similar to the waiver 
option for extended term sentencing fact -finding.  See HRS 
§ 706–664(1) (“[T]he defendant shall have the right to hear 
and controvert the evidence against the defendant and to 
offer evidence upon the issue [of extended term sentencing] 
before a jury; provided that the defendant may waive the 
right to a jury determination under this subsection, in 
which case the determination shall be made by a court.”). 
We do not foresee future changes to repeat offender 
sentencing procedures to be markedly different from 
extended term sentencing procedures. 
Auld, 136 Hawaiʻ i at 256 –57, 361 P.3d at 483 –84. 
20Auld did not explain the meaning of the phrase “conduct or  
events[.]”   Id. at 255-56, 361 P.3d at 482 -83. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
29 
   Neither the circuit court nor the parties  had begun 
regulating their conduct as it related to sentencing prior to 
the issuance of the Auld  decision  because Means’ sentencing 
phase had not begun at the time Auld was published .21  The court, 
therefore, could have afforded Means the constitutional 
protections mandated by Auld  without revisiting  “previously [] 
regulated conduct.”  Prior to the “conduct”  of Means’ 
sentencing, both the State and the court were aware of Auld ’s 
constitutional mandate and Means demanded that they follow it.22   
  B ecause Means had been charged, but not yet convicted 
or sentenced at the time Auld  was published, Means was entitled 
to the protections of Auld.  Accordingly, the State was required 
to prove Means’ predicate prior convictions to a jury beyond a 
reasonable doubt prior to imposition of
 a mandatory minimum 
sentence as a repeat offender.   
                     
21  The sentencing phase of Means’ case (the triggering event for 
Auld’s requirement of a jury finding to support mandatory minimum sentencing 
based on repeat offender status) did not begin until after the jury verdict  
on November 25, 2015, a day after the publication of the Auld decision.  
Therefore, the “conduct or events” that triggered the due process protections 
of Auld took place after Auld was published.  Accordingly, Auld  should have 
been applied prospectively to the sentencing phase of Means’ case, requi ring 
a jury to find that Means’ prior convictions were sufficient to support the 
imposition of mandatory minimum sentencing as a repeat offender.  
 
22  The circuit court acknowledged the possibility that it would need 
to empanel a jury to decide whether Mean s’ previous convictions qualified him 
for the imposition of mandatory minimum sentencing as a repeat offender.  
During oral arguments on the State’s Motion for Imposition of Mandatory 
Minimum Sentencing, Means requested a hearing on his demand for a jury to 
decide the issue of predicate prior convictions.  The circuit court agreed to 
the hearing and said, “depending on what happens there, we either set it for 
trial by jury on the question or proceed to a [sentencing] hearing.”

 V. Conclusion 
  
The ICA’s December 13, 2018 Judg ment on Appeal is 
vacated, Means’ sentence is vacated, and the case is remanded to 
the circuit court for resentencing in accordance with this

23 It bears noting that Means was sentenced to five years 
imprisonment on October 21, 2016, the term of which is likely to expire 
before October 21, 2020 when factoring in credit for time served.  Means has 
likely been in custody since his arrest on September  2, 2015.
