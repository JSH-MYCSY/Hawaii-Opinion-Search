2   Petitioner/Claimant -Appellant -Appellant Kate X. Cui 
(Cui) appeals from the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ (ICA) 
January 2, 2020 Judgment on Appeal entered pursuant to its 
December 3, 2019 Memorandum Opinion.  The I CA affirmed the 
October 26, 2016  Decision and Order of the State of Hawaiʻi Labor 
and Industrial Relations Appeals Board ( the LIRAB).   
  Cui first applied for workers’ compensation benefits 
for a mental injury that she sustained as a result of harassment 
by her supervisor in August 2009, while employed by 
Respondent/Employer -Appellee-Appellee  the State of Hawaiʻi, 
Department of Health  (Employer).  Cui ’s original diagnosis  was 
Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood , for 
which Employer accepted liability .  Employer  began making 
temporary disability payments , as ordered by the Director of 
Labor and Industrial Relations ( the Director) .   
In March 2010, Employer terminated Cui’s employment .  
In June 2010, Cui’s doctor diagnosed her as suffering from Major 
Depressive Disorder.   After Cui’s diagnosis changed, the 
Director determined  that her Major Depressive Disorder  was 
caused by her termination and not her original stress injury .  
As a result, the Director  terminated Cui’s temporary disability 
payments . 
Cui filed a new workers ’ compensation claim form for 
the allege d injury arising out of her termination , as well as  an ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
3 amended claim form for her original claim, both listing Major 
Depressi ve Disorder  as her injury .  At Cui’s request, the LIRAB 
remanded both claims to the Director to determine whether her 
Major Depress ive Disorder was compensable under either claim .  
As relevant here, the Director deferred determination of whether  
Major Depressive Disorder was related to Cui’s original  stress 
injury because the Director could not locate a  claim for Major 
Depressive Diso rder in the record . 
  Cui appealed to the LIRAB, which  affirmed the 
Director’s decision deferring the determination of whether Cui’s 
Major Depressive Disorder was related to her August 2009 injury.  
Based on the Director’s deferral of the issue, the LIRAB 
concluded that it would be premature for it to decide the issue.   
  Cui appealed to the ICA, arguing inter alia , that her 
Major Depressive Disorder  was the result of a single continuous 
injury which began in August 2009 and that the LIRAB abused its 
discretion by deferring determination of compensability.  The 
ICA affirmed the LIRAB’s decision  and held that the LIRAB did 
not err by  failing to address whether Cui’s Major Depressive 
Disorder was re lated to her August 2009 injury because the 
Director  deferred  determination of the issue . 
  A review of the record shows that Cui filed an amended 
claim form for her August 2009 claim listing Major Depressive 
Disorder as an injury.  It appears that the Director overlooked ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
4 Cui’s amended claim form  and erroneously deferred determin ation 
of the issue .  In light of the circumstances presented here, the 
LIRAB abused its discretion by declining to  determin e whether 
Cui’s Major Depressive Disorder was related to her August 2009 
injury after the Director erroneously deferred  determination .  
Having filed an amended workers’ compensation claim form listing 
Major Depressive Disorder as an injury, Cui was entitled to 
receive a timely decision regarding whether her injury was 
compensable.   
  Accordingly, we vacate the ICA’s January 2, 2020 
Judgment on Appeal which affirmed the LIRAB’s October 26, 2016 
Decision and Order and remand to the LIRAB for further 
proceedings consistent with this opinion.  
I.  BACKGROUND  
  Cui was an epidemiologist with multiple advanced 
degrees who began working for Employer in 1998.  On 
September  22, 2009, Cui filed a claim for workers’ compensation 
benefits for a mental personal injury sustained on 
August 3, 2009, initiating Case No. AB  2011-206/DCD No. 2 -09-
40756 (WC Claim 1).1   
                         
1 Cui filed her claim using Form WC -5, entitled “Employee’s Claim for 
Workers’ Compensation Benefits.”  The date of accident listed on the Form 
WC-5 was originally noted as August 17, 2009, but was subsequently corrected 
to August  3, 2009 in the Director’s April 22, 2010 decision.   ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
5   On August 15, 2009 , prior to filing WC Claim 1, Cui 
was examined by a psychiatrist (Dr. Ponce) after being referred 
by her primary care provider .  Cui told Dr.  Ponce that her work 
stress began in February 2009 when her new supervisor 
(Supervisor)  gave Cui a negative performance  review.  Supervisor 
began meeting with Cui weekly and Cui  described the weekly 
meetings to Dr. Ponce as  “humiliating” and “harassment .”  
Dr. Ponce diagnosed Cui with Adjustment Disorder with Mixed 
Anxiety and Depressed Mood , arising out of the course of h er 
employment.  Cui began treatment with Dr. Ponce and continued to 
work.   
  On January 7, 2010, Cui was e valuated  by another 
psychiatrist (Dr. Steltzer) in an independent psychiatric 
evaluation .  Dr. Steltzer  confirmed Dr. Ponce’s diagnosis.   
  By lette r dated January 27, 2010, Adjuster -Appellee 
State of Hawaiʻi, Department of Human Resources Development 
(Adjuster)  accepted liability for Cui’s workers’ compensation 
claim for stress in the form of Adjustment Disorder with Mixed 
Anxiety and Depressed Mood .   
  By letter  dated February 8, 2010, Employer notified 
Cui that she would be terminated from her position for failure  ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
6 to improve her performance  (Termination Letter) .  Cui’s 
employment was terminat ed effective March  25, 2010.2   
A. Administrative  Proceedings  
  On April 22,  2010, the Director issued a decision 
finding that Cui’s Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and 
Depressed Mood  was a work injury , based on Employer’s acceptance 
of liability.  The Director  ordered Employer to pay Cui weekly 
temporary total disability benefits (TTD) and reserved the 
matter of permanent disability for a later date .  Neither party 
appealed this decision.  
  Following her termination, Cui continued to see 
Dr. Ponce for treatment  and Dr. Ponce’s treatment notes from 
these sessions demonstrate a substantial worsening of Cui’s 
condition.  In a June 1, 2010 treatment plan sent to Adjuster, 
Dr. Ponce changed his diagnosis to Major Depressive Disorder.3  
In an assessment dated September  7, 2010, Dr.  Ponce opined that 
once Cui accepted the reality of her termination, she 
“decompensated a nd is now in a Major Depressive Disorder 
state[.]”  In a progress report dated September 11, 2010, Dr. 
Ponce noted that Cui was “[v]ery depressed” and that her 
                         
2  Although the Termination Letter specified an effective date of 
February  22, 2010, Cui’s termination was ultimately effective March 25, 2010, 
after she requested and attended a pre -discharge hearing.   
 
3 Dr. Ponce  neither informed Cui of the change in diagnosis nor altered 
her medication regimen  based on his new diagnosis .   
 ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
7 “Adjustment Disorder has slipped into a Major Depressive 
Disorder [.]”   
  Dr. Steltzer  reviewed Cui’s medical records at the 
request of Adjuster and summarized his findings in a report 
dated October 28, 2010.  Dr. Steltzer agreed with Dr. Ponce’s  
diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder , but disagreed wit h 
Dr. Ponce as to the cause .  Dr. Steltzer concluded that Cui’s 
Major Depressi ve Disorder was caused by her termination , whereas 
Cui’s initial Adjustment D isorder was directly related to her 
August 3, 2009 stress injury .  In a letter to Adjuster dated 
February  11, 2011, Dr. Steltzer restated his opinion  that 
“[Cui’s] major depression developed in response to being 
terminated.”4   
  Adjuster, as Employer’s representative, terminate d 
Cui’s TTD benefits for WC Claim 1 effective March 21, 2011 , 
because it determined that Cui’s current diagnosis of Major 
Depressive Disorder resulted from her March 25, 2010 termination 
and not her original August 3, 2009 injury.   
  Following a hearing, t he Director  issued a 
supplemental decision on July 1, 2011  concluding that Employer 
                         
4 A third doctor, Dr. Joseph P. Rogers, performed an independent mental 
examination of Cui and agreed with Dr. Steltzer that “Cui’s Major Depressive 
Disorder is no longer related to [WC Claim 1] with the understanding that her 
termination from employment [March 2010]  caused a new injury and her prior 
Adjustment Disorder  related to [WC Claim 1] was aggravated into the level of 
a Major Depressive Disorder by her termination [.]”  (Emphases added.)  
 ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
8 was justified in terminating Cui’s TTD be nefits for WC Claim 1  
based on the finding that Cui’s Major Depressive Disorder was no 
longer the result of the WC Claim 1 injury .  Cui timely appealed 
the Director’s supplemental d ecision to the LIRAB.   
  On August 10, 2012, Cui moved to temporarily remand 
the case to the Director  to rule on whether Cui’s Major 
Depressive Disorder was a compensable injury .  In an affidavit 
attached to Cui’s motion to remand, Cui’s counsel attested  that 
he would file (1) an amended  Form WC-5 for WC  Claim 1 listing 
Major De pressive  Disorder as an additional injury suffered by 
Cui as a result of the August  3, 2009 accident ; and (2) a new 
Form WC-5 alleging that Cui’s Major Depressi ve Disorder resulted 
from her March 25, 2010 termination  to ensure  that “the Director 
will have jurisdiction to decide all possible outcomes[ .]”  The 
LIRAB granted Cui’s motion  and remanded to the Director “to 
address compensability of a claim to be filed by [Cui] for Major 
Depressive Disorder and for determination  of any other issue the 
Director dee ms appropriate. ”   
  On remand, Cui filed a Form WC-5 dated August  28, 2012  
alleging that her Major Depressive Disorder resulted from her 
termination  on March 25, 2010 , initiating LIRAB Case No. 
AB 2013-232/DCD No. 2 -12-40661 (WC Claim  2).   
  On May 1, 20 13, Cui filed an “Amended” Form WC -5 
(Amended Form WC -5) “[t]o add major depression  as a diagnosis ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
9 and facilitate adjudication of [her] claims.”   Cui’s Amended 
Form WC-5 listed the “Date of Accident” as March  25, 2010 (the 
date she was terminated) and the “Date Disability Began” as 
August 3, 2009.5   
  On May 2, 2013 , the Director heard the issue s on 
remand.  Cui argued that her Major Depressive Disorder was 
compensable under WC Claim 1 because it was the result of a 
continuous injury which began on August 3, 2009, and in the 
alternative, that it was compensable as a new injury under 
WC Claim 2.  Employer argued that (1) the Director lacked 
jurisdiction to consider whether Cui’s Major Depressive Disorder 
was compensable under WC Claim 1 because the record co ntained no 
written claim for Major Depressive Disorder related to the 
August 3, 2009 injury ;6 and (2) Cui’s WC Claim 2 was time -barred 
because it was filed more than two years after her injury 
manifested.    
  On June 6, 2013, the Director issued two separa te 
decisions as to whether Cui’s Major Depressive Disorder was a 
                         
5 The record contains two Amended Forms WC -5, one that is typed a nd one 
that is partially typed with handwritten strikethroughs and insertions.  Both 
forms are dated May 1, 2013.   
 
6 According to Cui, after Employer argued that WC Claim 1 was never 
amended to include a claim for Major Depressive Disorder, she filed a “ Second 
Amended WC -5” on May 3, 2013.  However, both Amended Form WC -5s in the record 
are date -stamped May 1, 2013.  ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 compensable injury.  As to WC Claim 1 , the Director ’s decision 
states in relevant part : 
FINDINGS OF FACT  
 The Director’s Decision dated 4/22/2010 determined 
that [Cui]’s injury of 8/3/2009 co nsisted of Adjustment 
Disorder with Mixed Anxiety.7 
 
 The record affirms that a Major Depressive Disorder 
is a psychological condition separate and distinct from an 
Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety, although it is 
possible for one to lead to the othe r. 
 
 The record is absent of a written claim from [Cui] 
for a Major Depressive Disorder .   
 
 . . . . 
 
PRINCIPLES OF LAW  
 
 . . . . 
 
 Section 386 -86, HRS,8 and Hawaiʻi Supreme Court 89 H. 
411,9 provides that where no written claim was filed with 
                         
7 The Director’s June 6, 2013 Decision misstated Cui’s full diagnosis , 
which was  Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood .  
(Emphasis added.)  
 
8 Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 386-86 (Supp. 2005) provides in 
relevant part:  
 
 (a)  If a claim for compensation is made, the 
director shall  make such further investigation as deemed 
necessary and render a decision within sixty days after the 
conclusion of th e hearing  awarding or denying compensation, 
stating the findings of fact and conclusions of law.   The 
director may extend the due date for decisions for good 
cause provided all parties agree.   The decision shall be 
filed with the record of the proceedings and a copy of the 
decision shall be sent immediately to each party.  
     (b)  The hearing shall be informal and shall afford 
the parties a full and fair opportunity to present the 
facts and evidence to be considered .  Hearings under this 
section shall not be subject to chapter 91.   No 
stenographic or tape recording shall be allowed.  
 
(Emphases added.)  
  
9 In Potter v. Hawaii Newspaper Agency , 89 Hawaiʻi 411, 423, 974 P.2d 51, 
63 (1999), this court stated: “The plain language of [HRS § 386 -86] ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
11 the Director , the Director lacks the statutory authority to 
award or deny benefits to an injured employee.  
 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  
 
 The Director finds, based upon the above Findings of 
Fact and Principles of Law, the Director is unable to make 
a determination on the comp ensability of [Cui’s] Major 
Depressive Disorder.  The Director credits an absence for 
said condition in the record .    
 
(Emphases added .)  Accordingly,  the Director deferred 
determination of whether Cui’s Major Depressive Disorder  was a 
compensable injury under WC Claim 1 .10   
  In the second written decision regarding WC Claim 2, 
the Director concluded that Cui suffered a compensable injury of 
Major Depressive Disorder as the result of her termination on 
March 25, 2010.  The Director waived the two -year sta tute of 
limitations set forth in HRS § 386-82 (1993),11 “in light of the 
confusing nature of [Cui’s] psychological situation having one 
                         
(. . . continued) 
 
establishes that ‘a claim for compensation’ is a precondition of an order 
awarding or denying workers’ compensation benefits.  In the absence of a 
lawful claim , the Director lacked the statutory authority either to award or 
to deny benefits to [the worker].”   (Emphasis added.)  
 
10 The Director awarded Cui 8% permanent partial disability for WC Claim  1 
based on her original diagnosis . 
 
11 HRS § 386 -82 (1993) provides in relevant part:  
 
 The right to compensation under this chapter sh all be 
barred unless a written claim therefor is made  to the 
director of labor and industrial relations (1) within two 
years after  the date at  which the effects  of the injury 
for which the employee is  entitled to compensation have 
become manifest [.] 
 
(Emphases added.)  ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
12 condition superimposed upon another with a delay in a 
corresponding psychological explanation for claimant.”   
  Cui appe aled the Director’s June 6, 2013 Decision  in 
WC Claim 1  and Employer and Adjuster (collectively Employer -
Adjuster) appealed the Director’s June  6, 2013 Decision in WC 
Claim 2.  On October 21, 2013, the  parties stipulated  to 
consolidate  the cases for WC Cla im 1 and WC Claim 2 .   
  The LIRAB heard the consolidated cases on 
August 24, 2014, and both Cui and Dr. Ponce testified .  As 
relevant here, Dr. Ponce testified that (1)  he saw Cui as a 
patient between August 15, 2009 and May 24, 2014, approximately 
thirty times total; (2) he initially diagnosed Cui with 
Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood ; 
(3) from March to June 2010, after Cui was formally notified 
that her position was terminated, she began to decompensate and 
was in a “noticeable d ownward spiral,” so the diagnosis 
“evolved” to Major Depressive Disorder ; (4) Cui’s “depression 
was present right from the start ” and “gradual[ly] slip[ped] 
into . . . [M]ajor [D]epressive [D]isorder .”   
  Both parties submitted post-hearing brief s to the 
LIRAB, wherein each noted that the record contained an Amended 
Form WC-5 listing Major Depressive Disorder as an additional 
injury Cui suffered as a result of WC Claim 1 .   ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
13   The LIRAB issued its October 26, 2016  Decision and 
Order (LIRAB Decision and Order) on the consolidated appeals .  
The LIRAB (1) affirmed the Director’s decision in WC Claim 1 
because it concluded that it would be premature for the LIRAB to 
determine whether Cui’s Major Depressive Disorder was 
compensable under WC Claim 1  since the Dire ctor had deferred 
determination o f whether Cui’s Major Depressive Disorder related 
to her August 3, 2009 work injury; and (2)  reversed the 
Director’s decision in WC Claim 2 b ecause it concluded that 
Cui’s injury manifested by June 1, 2010 and was barred by  the 
two-year statute of limitations set forth in HRS §  386-82.   
B. ICA Proceedings  
  Cui appealed to the ICA .  On appeal, Cui argued that 
her Major Depressive Disorder was compensable under WC Claim 2 
and that her claim was timely filed because Cui did n ot know of 
the probable compensable character of her injury before 
Dr. Steltzer’s February  11, 2011 opinion.  In the alternative, 
Cui argued that  her Major Depressive Disorder  was compensable 
under WC Claim 1 because it was the result of a single 
continuou s injury which began on August 3, 2009  and that the 
LIRAB abused its discretion by deferring determination of 
compensability.   
  In its answering brief , Employer -Adjuster repeated its 
arguments that Cui’s WC Claim 2 was time -barred because Cui ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
14 (continued . . .) 
 filed the c laim more than two years after she “should have 
recognized the nature and probable compensable character of her 
major depressive disorder [.]”  Regarding the LIRAB’s decision to 
defer determination of whether Cui’s Major Depressive Disorder 
was compensable under WC Claim 1, Employer -Adjuster argued that 
because the Director had not yet made a determination, it was 
within the LIRAB’s discretion to decline to make a 
determination .  Employer -Adjuster cited § 12-47-20 of the Labor 
and Industrial Relations Appeal  Board Rules  of Practice and 
Procedure ( LAB Rules ) which states: “The board may decline to 
hear and determine any issue which the director in the decision 
on appeal did not decide or left for future determination.”   
  The ICA affirmed the LIRAB Decision a nd Order.  First, 
the ICA concluded that the LIRAB did not err in concluding  that 
Cui’s WC Claim 2 was time-barred.  Next, the ICA considered 
whether t he LIRAB abused its discretion by deferring 
determination of whether Cui’s Major Depressive Disorder was 
compensable under WC Claim 1.  The ICA noted that (1) the 
Director conducted a hearing on the issue of compensability of 
Cui’s Major Depressive Disorder on May  2, 2013; (2) the parties 
agreed that Cui filed an Amended Form WC-5 on May 3, 2013;12 and 
                         
12 Although the ICA noted that there were two Amended Forms WC -5 in the 
record date -stamped May 1, 2013, the ICA inferred that both of these were 
filed under LIRAB Case No. AB 2013 -232/DCD No. 2 -12-40661 (WC Claim 2).  ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
15 (3) the Director’s June 6, 2013 Decision in WC Claim 1 deferred 
determination of the issue of compensability based on the 
alleged absence of an Amended Form WC-5 for Major Depressive 
Disorder.  Citing Hawaiʻi Administrative Rules (HAR) § 12-47-2013 
and LAB Rules § 12-47-20, the ICA concluded that the LIRAB did 
not abuse its discretion by failing to address whether Cui’s 
Major Depressive Disorder was compensable under WC Claim 1 
because the Director had not ye t made a determination .  In light 
of the fact that both the Directo r and the LIRAB deferred 
determination,  the ICA further concluded that  it was unable to 
review Cui’s claim that her Major Depressive Disorder was the 
result of a single continuous injury da ting back to 
August 3, 2009.   
II.  STANDARDS OF REVIEW  
A. Appeals from Agency Determinations Relating to Workers’ 
Compensatio n 
 
 Appellate review of the LIRAB’s decision is governed 
by HRS § 91 –14(g) (1993), which provides that:  
 
Upon review of the record  the court may affirm the 
decision of the agency or remand the case with 
instructions for further proceedings; or it may 
                         
(. . . continued) 
 
Despite the fact that  the ICA was unable to locate an Amended Form WC -5 dated 
May 3, 2013 in the record , it credited as true the parties’ assertion s in 
briefing that an Amended Form WC -5 for WC Claim 1 was filed on May 3, 2013.  
 
13 The language of HAR § 12 -47-20 is identical to LAB  Rules § 12-47-20.  
Both rules state: “The board may decline to hear and determine any issue 
which the director in the decision on appeal did not decide or left for 
future determination.”  ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
16 reverse or modify the decision and order if the 
substantial rights of the petitioners may have been 
prejudiced because the administrati ve findings, 
conclusions, decisions, or orders are:  
 
(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory 
provisions; or  
(2) In excess of the statutory authority or 
jurisdiction of the agency; or  
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure; or  
(4) Affected by other error of law; or  
(5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, 
probative, and substantial evidence on the whole 
record; or  
(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized by 
abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise 
of discretion.

 The LIRAB ’s conclusions of law are reviewed de novo, 
under the right/wrong standard.  Id.  Its findings of fact 
“are reviewable under the clearly erroneous standard to 
determine if the agency decision was clearly erroneous in 
view of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on 
the whole record.”  Id. (quoting Poe v. Hawaiʻi Labor

citation s corrected) . 
B. Interpretation of Agency Rules  
General principles of statutory construction apply in 
interpreting administrativ e rules.  As in statutory 
construction, courts look first at an administrative rule’s 
language.  If an administrative rule’s language is 
unambiguous, and its literal application is neither 
inconsistent with the policies of the statute the rule 
implements n or produces an absurd or unjust result, courts 
enforce the rule’s plain meaning.  While an agency’s 
interpretation of its own rules is generally entitled to 
deference, this court does not defer to agency 
interpretations that are plainly erroneous or incons istent

marks and citation omitted).  
III.  DISCUSSION  
  On certiorari, we consider whether th e ICA erred in 
affirming the LIRAB’s Decision and Order.  Because we conclude 
that the LIRAB abused its discretion by deferring determination 
of whether Cui’s Major Depressive Disorder was compensable under 
WC Claim 1 , we need not reach the issue of whether WC Claim 2 
was untimely . 
  Cui filed a claim for Major Depressive Disorder under 
WC Claim 114 and the Director was statutorily obligated to 
determine whether her injury was compensable under that claim 
within sixty days after the hearing.15  Yet, in the Director’s 
June 6, 2013 Decision, the Director misstated Cui’s original  
                         
14 On August 16, 2012, the Board remanded to the Director “to address  
compensability of a claim to be filed by [Cui] for Major Depressive Disorder 
and for determination of any other issue the Director deems appropriate.”  On 
August 28, 2012, Cui filed a new claim form alleging that her Major 
Depressive Disorder resulted fro m her termination on March  25, 2010, 
initiating WC Claim  2.  On May  1, 2013, Cui filed Amended Form WC -5 for her 
WC Claim 1 adding Major Depressive Disorder.   
   
15 HRS § 386 -86 provides in relevant part:  
 
 (a)  If a claim for compensation is made, the 
director shall  make such further investigation as deemed 
necessary and render a decision within sixty days after the 
conclusion of the hearing  awarding or denying compensation, 
stating the findings of fact and conclusions of law. . . .  
     (b)  The hearing s hall be informal and shall afford 
the parties a full and fair opportunity to present the 
facts and evidence to be considered .

18 (continued . . .) 
 diagnosis as “Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety,” rather 
than “Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed 
Mood[,]” and found that “ [t]he record is absent of a written 
claim from claimant for a Major Depressive Disorder.”  (Emphasis 
added.)  The Director cited HRS §  386-32(a) and Potter, 89 
Hawaiʻi 411, 974 P.2d 51 , for the proposition that  “where no 
written claim was filed with the Director, the Director lacks 
the statutory authority to award or deny benefits to an injured 
employee. ”16  Based on the purported “absence of a written claim 
for said c ondition in the record []” of WC Claim 1,  the Director  
concluded as a matter of law that “ the Director is unable to 
make a determination on the compensability of [Cui’s] Major 
Depressive Disorder. ”17   
                         
16 The Director’s reliance on Potter to defer determination of 
compensability was misplaced.  In Potter, this co urt considered whether a 
claim form filed by an employer on behalf of an injured employee, without the 
employee’s authorization, could be construed as a valid claim un der HRS 
chapter 386.  89 Hawaiʻi at 422-23, 974 P.2d at 62 -63.  We concluded that an 
employer’s report of an industrial injury is not a lawful claim for workers’ 
compensation and that “[i]n the absence of a lawful claim, the Director 
lacked the statutory authority either to award or to deny benefits to [the 
employee].”  Id. at 423, 974 P.2d at  63. 
 Here, the record contains both Cui’s original Form WC -5 listing 
Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood  and her Amended 
Form WC-5, adding Major Depressi ve Disorder  as an injury.  (Emphasis added .)  
Thus, even if the Director overloo ked Cui’s Amended Form WC -5, this was not 
like Potter in which “no lawful claim for workers’ compensation benefits was 
filed with the Director[.]”  See id.   
 
17 Nor did the purported lack of a written claim for Major Depressive 
Disorder for WC Claim 1 prec lude the Director from making a declaratory 
determination  that Cui would be entitled to workers’ compensation benefits 
for WC Claim 1 if she filed an amended claim form .  In Potter, we reiterated 
the general principle that the Director can make declaratory  rulings: 
“Unquestionably, the Director may issue declaratory  rulings concerning ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
19   “The plain language of [HRS § 386 -86] establishes that  
‘a claim for compensation ’ is a precondition of an order 
awarding or denying workers ’ compensation benefits.  In the 
absence of a lawful claim, the Director lack [s] the statutory 
authority either to award or to deny benefits to [an 
applicant] .”  Potter, 89 Hawaiʻi at 423, 974 P.2d at 63.  Here, 
the record on appeal contains an Amended Form WC -5 dated 
May 1, 2013 listing Major Depress ive Disorder  as an injury .  
Thus, the precondition for “a claim for compensation” was met, 
see id., and the Director’s finding that the Director lacked 
statutory authority to  determine the compensability of Cui’s 
Major Depressive Disorder under WC Claim  1 was clearly 
erroneous.   
  Based on the Director’s decision to defer 
determination, t he LIRAB concluded that it would be “premature” 
for it to determine whether Cui’s Major Depressive Disorder was 
compensable under WC Claim 1 .  The LIRAB cited no authority for 
its own deferral of the issue and  failed to acknowledge that Cui 
actually filed an Amended Form WC -5, despite the fact t hat both 
parties referred to the Amended Form WC -5 in their briefs.   
                         
(. . . continued) 
 
whether, in a specific set of circumstances, a claimant would be entitled to 
workers’ compensation benefits upon the bringing of a lawful claim.”  
89 Hawaiʻi at 423, 974 P.2d at 63.   ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
20   Here, the LIRAB exercised its discretion when it 
declined to address the issue of  whether Cui’s Major Depressive 
Disorder was related to WC Claim 1.  Accordingly, this court 
reviews th e LIRAB’s decision to defer determination of the issue 
reserved by the Director for abuse of discretion.  See Van Ness , 
131 Hawaiʻi at 558, 319 P.3d at 477. 
 The standard of review for administrative agencies 
therefore consists of two parts: first, an analysis of 
whether the legislature empowered the agency with 
discretion to make a particular determination; and second, 
if the agenc y’s determination was within its realm of 
discretion, whether the agency abused that discretion (or 
whether the agency’s action was otherwise “arbitrary, or 
capricious, or characterized by ... [a] clearly unwarranted 
exercise of discretion [.]”  HRS § 91 –14(g)(6)).  If an 
agency determination is not within its realm of discretion 
(as defined by the legislature), then the agency’ s 
determination is not entitled to the deferential “abuse of 
discretion” standard of review.  If, however, the agency 
acts within it s realm of discretion, then its determination 
will not be overturned unless the agency has abused its 
discretion.  
 
Paul’s Elec . Serv., Inc. v. Befitel , 104 Hawaiʻi 412, 417, 91 
P.3d 494, 499 (2004), as corrected  (July 14, 2004)  (internal 
citation omitted)  (emphasis added) .  Both HAR § 12-47-20 and LAB 
Rules § 12 -47-20 provide  that “[t] he board may decline to hear 
and determine any issue which the director in the decision on 
appeal did not decide or left for future determination. ”  The 
authorizing statute fo r both rules is HRS § 371 -4 (2015), which 
states in relevant part that “[t]he board shall have power to 
decide appeals from decisions and orders of the director of 
labor and industrial relations issued under the workers ’ 
compensation law [.]”  Thus, the LIRAB was empowered by the ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
21 Legislature to decline to determine whether Cui’s Major 
Depressive Disorder was compensable under  WC Claim 1 because the 
Director had yet to render a decision on compensability.   
  However, as previously stated, the Director ’s decision 
to defer determination of the issue based on the purported 
absence of an Amended Form WC -5 was clearly erroneous.  The 
record on  appeal to the LIRAB contained  Cui’s Amended 
Form WC-5.18  Moreover, because the LIRAB conducted a hearing on 
the consolidat ed cases and heard testimony from Cui and 
Dr. Ponce, the LIRAB had the benefit of  additional evidence that 
was not before the Director .  By enacting HRS § 386 -86, the 
Legislature mandated that workers’ compensation claimants would 
receive a timely decision  on the merits of their claims.   See 
HRS § 386 -86(a) (“If a claim for compensation is made, the 
director shall  . . . render a decision within sixty days after 
the conclusion of the hearing  awarding or denying compensation, 
stating the findings of fact and conclusions of law. ”).  Yet 
here, after holding a hearing on Cui’s consolidated claims to 
determine the issue of compensability, the LIRAB either 
                         
18  We also note that the Form WC -5 is only two -pages long and was 
unlikely to provide the Director with additional information to make a 
determination regarding compensability, considering that the record already 
contained voluminous medical and p sychiatric records which documented  Cui’s 
condition and treatment.    ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
22 overlooked or ignored Cui’s Amended Form WC -5 and deferred 
determination of the issue . 
  In light of the  circumstances of this case and  the 
statutory  mandate that claimants receive a  decision within sixty 
days of a hearing, see HRS § 386 -86(a), we conclude that the 
LIRAB abused its discretion by deferring determination of 
whether Cui’s Major Depressive Disorder wa s compensable under WC 
Claim 1.   
  On appeal, t he ICA held that the LIRAB did not err by  
deferring  determin ation because  HAR § 12-47-20 and LAB Rules 
§ 12-47-20 permit the LIRAB to “decline to hear and determine 
any issue which the director in the decisio n on appeal did not 
decide or left for future determination .”  However, here , the 
literal application of this rule “ produces an absurd [and] 
unjust result ,” see Liberty Dialysis -Hawaii, 130 Hawaiʻi at 103, 
306 P.3d at 148, because it would permit the LIRAB to defer 
determination of the issue based on the Director’s erroneous 
finding that Cui failed to file an Amended Form WC -5.  Moreover, 
the ICA found Cui’s Amended Form WC -5 in the record, yet st ill 
concluded  that the LIRAB did not err in deferring determination 
of the issue.  As a result , the ICA erred by affirming the LIRAB 
Decision and Order  because the LIRAB abused its discretion by  
declining to make a determination on whether Cui’s Major 
Depressive Disorder was compensable under WC Claim  1.   ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

  For the foregoing reasons , we vacate the ICA’s

19 As the ICA correctly noted, there is no decision “to review Cui’s 
contention that this entire matter arose from the August  3, 2009 injury and 
should be treated as a single injury.”  However, the record does seem to 
support Cui’s argument that her mental impairment should be treated as a 
single industrial injury dating back to WC Claim 1.  Dr. Ponce, Cui’s 
treating psychiatrist who saw her more than thirty times, has consistently 
opined t hat Cui’s Major Depressive Disorder was related to her original 
stress injury and not caused by her March 25, 2010 termination.  
Additionally, t he most severe manifestation of Cui’s psychiatric disorder 
occurred in April 2009 when Cui engaged in self -harm — which was the original 
stress injury that Cui sought treatment for .  Thus, the record supports Cui’s 
argument that her mental impairment should be treated as a single industrial 
injury dating back to WC Claim 1.
