 for protection prohibited Bright from, inter alia, coming within 
100 feet of the protected party at a “neutral location.”  This 
case requires us to determine whether Bright’s place of work was 
a “neutral location” under the terms of the order for 
protection.  We hold that it was not. 
The rule of lenity requires any ambiguous terms to be 
construed in favor of the defendant.  Because “neutral location” 
is not defined by the order for protection and reasonable minds could disagree about its definition, it is ambiguous and 
therefore must be interpreted narrowly.  We hold that in the 
context of this order for protection, “neutral location” means a 
place that is unaffiliated with either party.  As Bright’s place 
of employment was not a neutral location, he did not violate the 
order for protection and his conviction must be reversed.   
I.  BACKGROUND 
On November 10, 2015, Bright consented to the entry of 
an order for protection that restrained him from having any 
contact with the protected party.  The relevant terms of the 
protective order provided:  
B. CONTACT BETWEEN THE PARTIES  
 
[1] Respondent is prohibited from contacting the 
Petitioner.  
 
[2] Respondent is prohibited from telephoning, 
writing or otherwise electronically communicating (by recorded message, pager, etc.), including 
through [a] third party, with the Petitioner and any 
children residing with the Petitioner.   
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

[3] Respondent is prohibited from coming or 
passing within 100 yards of any place of employment 
or where the Petitioner lives and within 100 feet of 
each other at neutral locations.  In the event the 
parties happen to come upon each other at a neutral location, the subsequent arriving party shall leave 
immediately or stay at least 100 feet from the 
other.  When the parties happen to come upon each 
other at the same time at a neutral location, the 
Respondent shall leave immediately or stay at least 100 feet from the Petitioner.  
 
Do not violate this order even if the Petitioner invites you to be at the place of employment or 
where the other lives.
 
 
. . . .  
 
[4] Other: Both parties are permitted to use 
Kuamoo Road to access their respective residences. 
 
The order does not define the term “neutral location.”  
On April 15, 2016, the State of Hawaiʻ i (State) charged 
Bright with violating an order for protection, pursuant to 
Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 586-5.51 and 586-11(a)2 (2018).  
                     
1 HRS § 586- 5.5 provides in relevant part: 
 
(a) If, after hearing all relevant evidence, 
the court finds that the respondent has failed to 
show cause why the [temporary restraining order] 
should not be continued and that a protective order 
is necessary to prevent domestic abuse or a 
recurrence of abuse, the court may order that a protective order be issued for a further fixed 
reasonable period as the court deems appropriate. 
 
 The protective order may include all orders 
stated in the temporary restraining order and may 
provide for further relief as the court deems necessary to prevent domestic abuse or a recurrence 
of abuse, including orders establishing temporary 
visitation and custody with regard to minor children 
of the parties and orders to either or both parties to participate in domestic violence intervention 
services. 
2 HRS § 586- 11(a) provides: “Whenever an order for protection is 
granted pursuant to this chapter, a respondent or person to be restrained who

 The State alleged that on January 26, 2016, Bright encountered
 
the protected party on the steps of the Fifth Circuit 
courthouse, in violation of the order for protection.  On 
September 12, 2016, the family court held a bench trial.  The 
following testimony was adduced at trial.   
In mid-January 2016, Bright began working as a 
documents clerk at the Fifth Circuit courthouse.  The protected 
party, who was a forensic social worker, had to go to the courthouse three to four times a week as part of her job.  The 
Deputy Chief Court Administrator, Alton Amimoto, testified that 
Bright’s job required him to start work promptly at 7:45 a.m., 
and that while new employees may have been allowed to park in 
the back of the courthouse and enter through the back door to 
avoid the public entrance at the front of the building, 
“[g]enerally, . . . all new employees park in the front and 
enter through the front entrance.”   
On the morning of January 26, 2016 – about a week 
after Bright started work – at approximately 7:40 a.m., the protected party and her father were “walking towards the court 
building to get in, and as [they] approached before the stairs, 
[she] noticed Justin [Bright] walking from the parking lot[.]”  
                     
knowingly or intentionally violates the order for protection is guilty of a 
misdemeanor.”  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 When she reached the top of the stairs, Bright was about 20 feet 
away from her.  She tes
tified that when Bright was 12–15 feet 
away from her, approaching the stairs, “he looked right at me.  He looked at my dad also.  We were the only two people up 
there.”  The protected party and her father entered the 
courthouse and went through security.  Bright did not speak to 
her during the encounter, and he did not follow her into the 
courthouse.  Instead, he stopped outside the courthouse and stood at the top of the stairs about 10-12 feet away from the 
courthouse doors.   
The protected party’s father similarly testified that 
Bright came “between 12 and 15 feet” of the protected party. He 
agreed that Bright stopped at the top of the steps and did not 
enter the courthouse, and explained that instead of following 
them, Bright walked over to a short wall or bench and sat down.   
Amimoto testified that at around 7:45 a.m., he saw 
Bright sitting in the front of the courthouse on a bench about 100 feet from the courthouse doors.  When Amimoto approached, 
Bright told him that “he [Bright] had a problem.”  Bright 
“looked sad or unsure,” and explained about the order for 
protection, telling Amimoto that “he saw [the protected party] 
going into the building so he wasn’t sure what he should do.”  
Amimoto then took Bright into the courthouse through the back  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 entrance.    
Bright testified on his own behalf.  He explained that 
he didn’t see the protected party until he was 10–12 feet away 
from her because he had been on his phone while walking through 
the parking lot.  He told the court, “I didn’t know she was 
there until I – until I saw her and then I kind of panicked 
because it was already too late.”  When asked why he did not 
immediately leave, he testified:  
Well, I panicked at that time and I then I kind of 
like wasn’t sure what to do because I still had to go to work and they were there, so I ended up kind of 
panicking for a little while and then walking away 
and I just stayed outside and was kind of unsure what 
to do. 
 
. . . . 
 
I mean, like I still had to go to work.  I mean, being late
 – because I started working there, you 
know, being late on the first couple days isn’t a 
good – good thing to do.   
 
Bright did not know that the protected party would be 
at the courthouse that day: “I knew that she would eventually 
come here, yes.  I assumed that I would be here before her 
because I’m a Judiciary – I was a Judiciary employee with 
different hours.”   
At the conclusion of trial, the family court found 
Bright guilty of violating the order for protection and 
sentenced him to two years of probation.  The court discredited 
Bright’s testimony that he did not see the protected party until  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 he was too close to her because the protected party and her 
father were the only other people walking into the courthouse at 
the time.  Although Bright had argued that the courthouse was 
not a “neutral location” because it was Bright’s place of work, 
the family court never made an explicit finding whether the 
courthouse constituted a “neutral location” under the terms of 
the order for protection.  However, the parties agree on appeal 
that the family court implicitly determined Bright’s place of employment was a “neutral location” because the family court 
held that Bright had two options: “One is he could have remained 
at a distance, the hundred feet is what the protective order 
said, or he could have left because they were there first.”   
Bright appealed to the Intermediate Court of Appeals 
(ICA), arguing that the courthouse was not a “neutral place” 
because it was Bright’s place of employment.
3  The State conceded 
that “there is more than one reasonable way to interpret” the term “neutral location,” but argued that if the court found that “neutral location” did not include Bright’s workplace, only his 
office – not the entire building – would have been exempted from 
the terms of the protective order.   
The ICA affirmed Bright’s conviction in a summary 
                     
3 Bright raised several additional points of error to the ICA, but 
he raised only the “neutral location” issue in his application for writ of 
certiorari.

 disposition order.  While the ICA agreed with Bright that “[t]he 
outside parameters of the prohibitions contained in the Order 
for Protection are less than perfectly clear,” the ICA concluded 
that “there was substantial evidence that Bright came within 
both 100 feet of the complaining witness at a ‘neutral 
location,’ and 100 yards at ‘any place of employment.’  In 
either case then, Bright’s stated surprise at encountering the 
complaining witness notwithstanding, his action was in violation of the Order for Protection.”   
Bright timely filed an application for writ of 
certiorari.   
II.  STANDARD OF REVIEW 
“The interpretation or construction of a judgment, 
decree, or order ‘presents a question of law for the courts.’” 
State v. Guyton, 135 Hawaiʻ i 372, 377, 351 P.3d 1138, 1143 (2015) 
(quoting Cain v. Cain, 59 Haw. 32, 39, 575 P.2d 468, 474 
(1978)). “Questions of law are reviewed under the right/wrong 
standard of review.”  Id. (citing State v. Higa, 79 Hawaiʻ i 1, 3, 
897 P.2d 928, 930 (1995)).  
III.  DISCUSSION 
An order for protection must be “clear and 
unambiguous” because “fairness and due process dictate that a 
court order must be sufficiently particular and definite so as  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
9 
 to clearly identify the conduct that it prohibits.”  Id. at 377–
78, 351 P.3d at 1143–44 (quoting LeMay v. Leander, 92 Hawaiʻ i 
614, 625, 994 P.2d 546, 557 (2000)).  If an order for protection 
is ambiguous, under the rule of lenity, it must be “construed in 
favor of the defendant.”  Id. at 381, 351 P.3d at 1147.  
The stay-away provision of the order for protection 
against Bright states:  
Respondent is prohibited from coming or passing 
within 100 yards of any place of employment or 
where the Petitioner lives and within 100 feet 
of each other at neutral locations.  In the 
event the parties happen to come upon each other at a neutral location, the subsequent 
arriving party shall leave immediately or stay 
at least 100 feet from the other.  When the 
parties happen to come upon each other at the same time at a neutral location, the Respondent 
shall leave immediately or stay at least 100 
feet from the Petitioner. 
 
 
The order also provides an exception:  “Both parties 
are permitted to use Kuamoo Road to access their respective 
residences.”  Thus, the order for protection identifies three categories of locations:  (1) a residence, which includes 
Bright’s home as well as the protected party’s, (2) “any place 
of employment,” and (3) “neutral locations.”  It restrains 
Bright from coming within 100 yards of the protected party’s 
residence and her place of employment (the 100-yard 
prohibition).  It also requires him to stay 100 feet away from 
her at “neutral locations” (the 100-feet prohibition) – but the 
order does not define what constitutes a “neutral location.”

10 
 A. 
The ICA Erred in Concluding that Regardless of How the 
Court Interprets the Phrase “Neutral Location,” Bright 
Violated the Order for Protection. 
 
The ICA concluded that even if the 100-feet 
prohibition did not apply to Bright’s place of employment, he 
still violated the order for protection because he came within 
100 yards of the protected party at a place of employment.  
According to the ICA, the 100-yard prohibition restrained Bright 
from coming within 100 yards of the protected party if the parties were at any place of employment – including his own.  
This misreads the protective order.   
The 100-yard prohibition restrains Bright from coming 
within 100 yards of two locations – “[1] any place of employment 
or [2] where the Petitioner lives” – not within 100 yards of the protected party at those locations.  In other words, Bright 
could not go to the protected party’s place of employment, even if she was not there, because he could not go within 100 yards 
of the place.  The phrase “any place of employment or where Petitioner lives,” when read in context, must refer to the 
protected party’s place of employment – not Bright’s.  If the 
term referred to Bright’s place of employment it would create an 
absurd result:  He would be restrained from coming within 100 
yards of his own place of work.   
Moreover, Bright could not have been convicted of  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
11 
 violating the 100-yard prohibition because the State did not 
allege he violated that provision of the order for protection 
when it filed a Bill of Particulars prior to trial.  In the Bill 
of Particulars, the State only alleged that Bright came within 
100 feet of the protected party, and so that was the only 
conduct for which Bright could have been convicted of violating 
the order for protection.  See State v. Erickson, 60 Haw. 8, 9, 
586 P.2d 1022, 1023 (1978) (“After a bill of particulars is 
ordered furnished and is filed by the State and until it is 
properly amended, the State is limited to proving the 
particulars specified in the bill.”).   
Thus, the ICA erred in concluding that regardless of 
how the language in the order for protection is interpreted, 
Bright violated the order.  Bright was convicted of being within 
100 feet of the protected party.  Such conduct would only be a 
violation of the order for protection if Bright’s place of 
employment – the Fifth Circuit courthouse – is deemed a “neutral location.”  
B. Because the Order for Protection is Ambiguous, It Must be 
Construed in Favor of Bright. 
 
Bright argues that the plain meaning of “neutral” 
should govern, and “the plain common sense reading of the Order 
for Protection is that either party’s place of employment or 
place of residence is not a neutral location.”  While he ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
12 contends that the order for protection is not ambiguous, he 
asserts that even if this court deems the term “neutral 
location” to be ambiguous, the rule of lenity requires the term 
be strictly construed in favor of Bright.   
The State also contends that the order for protection 
is not ambiguous, but reaches a different conclusion as to the 
meaning of “neutral location”: “Because [Bright’s] place of 
employment is not specifically addressed in the Protective Order, the only reasonable interpretation of the Protective 
Order it [sic] that it is a neutral location to which the 
default rule applied[.]”
4   
If language is “subject to two possible meanings,” 
both of which are reasonable, it is ambiguous.  State v. 
Fukusaku, 85 Hawaiʻ i 462, 491, 946 P.2d 32, 61 (1997); see also 
State v. Toyomura, 80 Hawaiʻ i 8, 19, 904 P.2d 893, 904 
(1995)(“When there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an expression used in a 
statute, an ambiguity exists.” (quoting Mehau v. Reed, 76 Hawaiʻ i 
101, 109, 869 P.2d 1320, 1328 (1994)) (alteration omitted)).   
Here, the 100-feet provision of the order for 
protection is ambiguous.  Specifically, it is unclear whether a 
4However, as noted above, in its Answering Brief to the ICA, the 
State conceded that “there is more than one reasonable way to interpret 
‘neutral location[.]’”  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
13 “neutral location” refers to: (1) all locations that are not the 
protected party’s residence or place of employment, as the State 
now argues, or (2) locations that are unaffiliated with either 
party, as Bright argues.   Contrary to both parties’ 5
assertions, either interpretation could be reasonable.  In the 
face of an ambiguity, we turn to traditional canons of 
construction to guide our interpretation.    
In State v. Guyton, we explained that if an order for 
protection is ambiguous, in accordance with the rule of lenity 
“its language should be construed in favor of the defendant.”  
135 Hawai ʻi at 381, 351 P.3d at 1147.  In Guyton, the defendant 
was convicted of violating a protective order that restrained 
him from entering the protected party’s “residence, including 
yard” which the State had interpreted as including the 
protected party’s 1,000-acre macadamia nut farm and 
conservation land.  This court held that the protective order 
needed to be “clear and unambiguous,” and that “residence, 
including yard” should be 
5Other form orders for protection have approached general stay-
away provisions differently, suggesting that the language used here may be 
the exception, not the rule.  See, e.g., State v. Valenzona, 92 Hawaiʻ i 449, 
450, 992 P.2d 718, 719 (App. 1999) (prohibiting “visiting and/or 
remaining . . . within 100 feet of the Plaintiff at all other (neutral) 
locations”).  For example, the Hawaiʻ i Family Court of the First Circuit 
Temporary Restraining Order form specifies, 
“Do not approach or come within 
100 feet of the Subject(s).”   Temporary Restraining Order, Family Court Form 
1F-P-756, https://www.courts.state.hi.us/docs/1FP/1FP756.pdf (last visited

 given its ordinary meaning, which did not encompass the 
protected party’s entire 1,000-acre property.  Guyton, 135 
Hawaiʻi at 377-78, 351 P.3d at 1143-44.  We noted that even if 
the terms were ambiguous, under the rule of lenity, the “plain 
and popularly understood meaning” had to control.  Id. at 381, 
351 P.3d at 1147.  Here, we apply the rule in Guyton to hold 
that “neutral location” should be given its ordinary meaning.   
The State argues that Guyton is inapplicable because 
the defendant in that case did “not violate the spirit of a 
protective order, which typically prohibits in-person contact 
within 100 yards or 100 feet.”  Since Bright came within 100 
feet of the protected party, the State contends that his actions “violate[d] both the terms and the spirit of the Protective 
Order.”   
We disagree with the State’s interpretation of Guyton.  
At no point did we consider whether the defendant in Guyton 
violated the “spirit” of the protective order – the only question was whether he violated the terms of the order, as 
interpreted by their plain meaning and in accordance with the rule of lenity.  Id. at 381, 351 P.3d at 1147.  Even if we were 
to assume that the facts of this case demonstrate Bright violated the spirit of the order for protection, the spirit of 
the order cannot override its terms.  And, for the reasons  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
15 
 explained below, Bright did not violate the terms of the order 
for protection. 
C. 
In Accordance with the Rule of Lenity, a “Neutral Location” 
is a Place that is Unaffiliated with Either Party. 
 
The rule of lenity requires us to construe an 
ambiguous court order in favor of the defendant and “adopt a 
less expansive meaning.”  State v. Woodfall, 120 Hawaiʻ i 387, 
396, 206 P.3d 841, 850 (2009).  Here, the narrowest 
interpretation of “neutral location” is also the term’s plain 
and popularly understood meaning.  See Guyton, 135 Hawaiʻ i at 
381, 351 P.3d at 1147.   
To ascertain a word’s plain meaning, we “may resort to
legal or other well accepted dictionaries[.]”  State v. Pali, 129 Hawaiʻ i 363, 370, 300 P.3d 1022, 1029 (2013) (quoting State 
v. Kikuta, 125 Hawaiʻ i 78, 96, 253 P.3d 639, 658 (2011)) 
(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Guyton, 135 Hawaiʻ i
at 378, 351 P.3d at 1144 (using Oxford Dictionaries and the 
Merriam-Webster Dictionary to ascertain the plain meaning of 
“residence”).  Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary defines neutral as 
“not engaged on either side.”  Neutral (adj.), Merriam-Webster’s 
Collegiate Dictionary (11th ed. 2009) (emphasis added).  Similarly, the Oxford English Dictionary defines “neutral” as 
“[n]ot belonging to, associated with, or favoring any party or 
side,” and “[b]elonging to, or falling under, neither of two  
  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
16 
 specified, implied, or usual categories; occupying a middle 
position with regard to two extremes.”   Neutral (adj.), Oxford 6
English Dictionary Third Ed. (Sept. 2003) (emphasis added).  Thecommon thread between these definitions is that something is 
neutral if it is unaffiliated with either side of a dispute.  
Thus, the “plain and popularly understood meaning” of “neutral 
location” in this context means a place that is unaffiliated 
with either of the parties.  Therefore, locations affiliated with Bright – such as his place of employment – are not neutral 
locations.     
Our interpretation is consistent with the other 
provisions of the order for protection.  Locations affiliated 
with the protected party – her residence and place of employment 
– are clearly not considered neutral locations, as the order 
applies a separate prohibition to both those locations:  Bright 
may not go within 100 yards of those places.  Similarly, the 
order implicitly refers to Bright’s residence - “[b]oth parties are permitted to use Kuamoo Road to access their respective 
residences” - suggesting that it, too, is not a “neutral 
location.”  If the protected party’s residence and place of 
employment are not neutral locations, and Bright’s residence is 
                     
6 Black’s Law Dictionary similarly defines “neutral” as “[n]ot 
supporting any of the people or groups involved in an argument or 
disagreement[.] ”  NEUTRAL (adj.), Black’s Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019) 
(emphasis added).

17 
 not a neutral location, it follows that Bright’s place of 
employment is not a neutral location either.  Accordingly, 
Bright did not violate the order for protection by being within 
100 feet of the protected party at his place of employment, and 
his conviction must be reversed.7  
IV.  CONCLUSION 
Because we conclude that the term “neutral location” 
in the order for protection at issue was ambiguous, under the 
rule of lenity it must be construed in Bright’s favor and in 
accordance with its ordinary meaning.  Thus, “neutral location,” 
as used in the order for protection at issue, means a location 
that is unaffiliated with either party.  Because Bright’s 
workplace was not a neutral location, Bright did not violate the 
order for protection.  Accordingly, we vacate the ICA’s judgment    
                     
7 Even if the 100- feet prohibition did not apply at Bright’s 
workplace, the rest of the order remained enforceable and provided protection 
to the protected party at the Fifth Circuit courthouse.  Thus, regardless of 
the parties’ location, Bright could not have “any contact” with the protected party, could not “threaten[] or physically abus[e],” the protected party, or 
“maliciously damage any property of the [protected party] or property of the [protected party’s] household.” But here, there was no allegation that Bright 
contacted the protected party, only that he came within 100 feet of her.
