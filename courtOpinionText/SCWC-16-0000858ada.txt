 I.  Introduction
 
 This case, which concerns $537,000 in excess foreclosure 
sale proceeds, returns to this court for the third time.   The 
current iteration of the case arises from a separate action, 
Civil No. 06-1-228, filed on April 7, 2006 in the Circuit Court 1
of the Third Circuit  (“circuit court”) by Petitioners/
 
Plaintiffs-Appellants/Cross-Appellees Thomas Frank Sch
midt and 
Lorinna Jhincil Schmidt (collectively, “Schmidts” or 
“Petitioners”) after they obtained a December 21, 2004 final 
judgment against Realty Finance, Inc. ( “RFI”) for the excess 
proceeds, but later learned that those same proceeds were 
already transferred, leaving RFI insolvent and essentially 
judgment proof.  In their Amended Complaint filed on April 24, 
2006, the Schmidts raised claims pursuant to 
Hawaiʻi Revised 
Statutes (“HRS”) § 651C -7  alleging RFI fraudulently transferred 
the proceeds to the creditors of its parent company, 32
                         
1   See Schmidt v. HSC, Inc., 131 Hawaiʻ i 497, 319 P.3d 416 (2014) (“ Schmidt 
II”); Realty Finance, Inc. v. Schmidt, No. 23441 (Haw. Mar. 18, 2004) (mem.) 
(“Schmidt I”). 
 
2   The Honorable Greg K. Nakamura presided.  
 
3   HRS Chapter 651C governs Hawai ʻi’s Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act 
(“HUFTA”).  HRS § 651C -7 provides remedies under HUFTA.  
 
The Schmidts’ Amended Complaint also asserted a claim under HRS § 480 -
2, which prohibits “[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive 
acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.”  This claim is 
not discussed further as the circuit court had granted Respondents’ Motion 
for Judgment on the Pleadings as to this claim, and it is not the subject of 
the present appeal.  See  Schmidt v. HSC, Inc., Nos. 29454, 29589, at 5 (App. 
Aug. 30, 2013) (mem.).

 Respondent/Defendant
-Appellee/Cross -Appellant HSC, Inc. (“HSC”).   
Following a bench trial on July 1 and 2, 2008, the circuit court 
concluded the Schmidts did not prove by clear and convincing 
evidence RFI actually intended to hinder, delay, or defraud any 
creditors of RFI,4 and therefore entered judgment in favor of 
Respondents/Defendants- Appellees/Cross- Appellants HSC, Richard 
Henderson, Sr. (“Richard”), and Eleanor R.J. Henderson 
(“Eleanor”) (collectively, “Respondents”) .5    
Petitioners appealed unsuccessfully to the Intermediate 
Court of Appeals (“ICA”).  In deciding the Schmidts’ appeal, the 
ICA did not discuss the merits of the Schmidts’ challenge to the 
circuit court’s findings and conclusions, but rather concluded 
that the Schmidts’ HUFTA claim should have been dismissed as 
untimely.  See Schmidt, mem. op. at 10.    
After accepting certiorari, this court determined that the 
ICA’s decision on the statute of limitations provision in HRS § 
                         
4  To be clear, the Schmidts’ Amended Complaint cites only to HRS § 651C -
7, which provides remedies to creditors under HUFTA.  During closing argument 
before the circuit court, the Schmidts clarified that  Respondents violated 
HRS § 651C- 4(a)(1).  See  Schmidt II, 131 Hawaiʻi at 500, 319 P.3d at 419.  
Pursuant to the statute, “[a] transfer made or obligation incurred by a 
debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor . . . if the debtor made the transfer 
or incurred the obligation . . . [w]ith actual intent to hinder, delay, or 
defraud any creditor of the debtor  . . . .”  HRS § 651C -4(a)(1) (emphasis 
added).   
 
5   Richard was HSC’s president; Eleanor was a director of HSC and 
Richard’s wife.  See Schmidt II, 131 Hawaiʻ i at 500, 319 P.3d at 419.  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 6651C-9(1)
 was wrong as a matter of law because the ICA 
“incorrectly held that the statute of limitations r[an] from the 
date of the transfer, rather than from the date that Petitioners 
discovered the fraudulent nature of the transfer.”  Schmidt II, 
136 Hawaiʻi at 510, 319 P.3d at 429.  This court vacated the 
ICA’s Judgment on A ppeal and remanded the case to the ICA.  See 
131 Hawaiʻi at 512, 319 P.3d at 431.   
Consequently, the ICA published an opinion that 
“address[ed] the merits of the Schmidts’ challenge to [the] 
[c]ircuit [c]ourt’s rejection of their fraudulent transfers 
claims, irrespective of whether their claims are or may be 
barred by the statute of limitations.”  Schmidt v. HSC, Inc., 
136 Hawai ʻi 158, 164, 358 P.3d 727, 733 (App. 2015).  In sum, the 
                         
6   “A cause of action with respect to a fraudulent transfer or obligation 
under this chapter is extinguished unless action is brought . . . [u]nder 
section 651C- 4(a)(1), within four years after the transfer was made . . . or  
within one year after the transfer or obligation was or could reasonably have 
been discovered by the claimant[.]”  HRS § 651C -9(1). 
 
 One of the alternative theories presented by the Schmidts  as to why 
their HUFTA claims were timely, which this court rejected in Schmidt II, was 
that the limitations period was extended by six years pursuant to the 
doctrine of fraudulent concealment in HRS § 657 -20, which they argued applied 
to HUFTA by way of HRS § 651C -10 (“Unless displaced by the provisions of this 
chapter, the principles of . . . fraud . . . supplement its provisions.”).  
See Schmidt II, 131 Hawai ʻi at 510, 319 P.3d at 429.  This court noted in 
Schmidt II: 
 
Petitioners do not provide any defi nition of “fraudulent 
concealment” and therefore do not explain why the facts of 
this case constitute fraudulent concealment under any 
controlling legal standard.  Petitioners therefore do not 
make any discernable argument as to why the doctrine of 
fraudulent concealment should apply to the facts of this 
case.  Thus, we need not decide this issue.

 ICA concluded the circuit court erred in dismissing the 
Schmidts’ claims on the merits, as “the facts established by the 
record in this case . . . prove[d] by clear and convincing 
evidence that [RFI] actually intended to hinder, delay, or 
defraud any creditors of [RFI], as required 
by HRS § 651C-
4(a)(1).”  131 Hawai ʻi at 179, 358 P.3d at 748.  However, because 
the circuit court did not issue any findings or legal 
conclusions regarding when the Schmidts discovered, or could 
reasonably have discovered, the fraudulent nature of the 
transfers, the ICA remanded the case to the circuit court.  See 
136 Hawaiʻi at 180, 358 P.3d at 749.  
After remand, on October 19, 2016, the circuit court issued 
its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, which concluded the 
Schmidts’ claims were time -barred, as the Schmidts could 
reasonably have discovered the fraudulent nature of the 
transfers on or before February 21, 2005, but did not file a 
complaint until April 7, 2006, past the one- year statute of 
limitations period for HUFTA claims pursuant to HRS § 651C- 9(1).  
The circuit court entered Final Judgment on December 6, 2016.    
The Schmidts appealed,7 in sum asserting the circuit court 
clearly erred in determining when they could reasonably have 
                         
7   Respondents also cross -appealed regarding their motion for attorneys’ 
fees, which is not an issue before this court on certiorari, and therefore is 
not discussed further.

 8discovered the fraudulent nature of the subject transfers.
  The 
ICA rejected the Schmidts’ challenge, concluding the circuit 
court did not err in making findings that “aided in its 
determination of how and when the fraudulent nature of the 
subject transfers could reasonably have been discovered by the 
Schmidts, and we are not left with a definite and firm 
conviction that, based on all of the evidence, mistakes were 
made in these findings.”  Schmidt v. HSC, Inc., No. CAAP- 16-
0000858, at 3 (App. Nov. 30, 2018) (SDO).  Accordingly, the ICA 
entered a Judgment on Appeal on January 31, 2019 pursuant to its 
SDO affirming the circuit court’s December 6, 2016 Final 
Judgment and October 19, 2016 Findings of Fact and Conclusions 
of Law.  See Schmidt, SDO at 8.     
The Schmidts timely filed an Application for Writ of 
Certiorari on February 19, 2019 (“Application”), presenting the 
same three issues they previously argued before the ICA, all 
related to the date the circuit court determined the Schmidts 
could reasonably have discovered the fraudulent nature of the 
subject transfers: 
Whether the [ICA] gravely erred and the magnitude of such 
error or inconsistency dictates the need for further appeal 
where the ICA affirmed:  
 
                         
8   The Schmidts also raised an additional point of error regarding the 
circuit court’s award of costs to Respondents, which is not an issue before 
this court on certiorari, and therefore is not discussed further.

 (1)
  the circuit court’s findings of fact (“FOF”) nos. 5, 
13, 19, 21, 22 and 23[;]  
 
(2)  the circuit court’s conclusions of law (“COL”) nos. 
6, 8, 9 and 10[; and]  
 
(3)  the circuit court’s entry of final judgment denying 
[Petitioner s’] complaint against the [Respondents].  
 
In sum, the Schmidts assert they could not reasonably have 
discovered the fraudulent nature of the transfers until the July 
26, 2005 deposition of Michael Chagami, the chief financial 
officer9 of HSC, during which they learned RFI was insolvent, and 
that therefore their HUFTA claim was timely filed within the 
one-year statute of limitations period.10    
This court accepted the Schmidts’ Application.  The ICA 
erred in affirming the circuit court’s October 19, 2016 Findings 
of Fact and Conclusions of Law and December 6, 2016 Final 
Judgment, as the circuit court’s determination that the Schmidts 
“could have reasonably known of the Transfers and their 
fraudulent nature on or before February 21, 2005” contravenes 
this court’s ruling in Schmidt II .       
                         
9  Although the reco rd sometimes refers to Michael Chagami as HSC’s 
president or treasurer, the circuit court’s Findings of Fact identify him as 
the chief financial officer.    
 
10  The Schmidts did not argue to the ICA and do not now argue in their 
Application (in contrast to  their argument in the alternative in Schmidt II), 
see supra note 6, that a six -year extension to the limitations period 
prescribed in HRS § 651C -9(1) applies due to any “fraudulent concealment” by 
Respondents.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 II.  Background
 
 The following section proceeds with a background based on 
the uncontested findings of fact (“FOF”) of the circuit court 
and cited trial exhibits, followed by a recitat ion of the 
specific FOFs and conclusions  of law (“COL”)  specific ally 
challenged by the Schmidts, namely FOFs 5, 13, 19, 21, 22, and 
23, and COLs 6, 8, 9 , and 10.  
A. Factual and Procedural Background 
 In Realty Finance, Inc. v. Schmidt, Civil No. 97 -1235-03, 
RFI filed a foreclosure action (the “Foreclosure Case”) in the 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit (“trial court”).  An 
interlocutory decree of foreclosure was entered in favor of RFI 
and against the Schmidts.  After the Hawai ʻi Suprem
e Court 
remanded the case in Schmidt I  for an accounting of the value of 
the Schmidts’ mortgage debt in  light of third- party payments 
that should have been applied, the trial court filed an Order 
dated October 12, 2004 stating RFI owed the Schmidts over 
$537,000.  Later, by Order dated November 24, 2004, the trial 
court denied the Schmidts’ motion for prejudgment interest.   On 
December 21, 2004, the trial court entered a separate “final 
judgment” in the Foreclosure Case.   Later that same day, both 
the Schmidts and Respondents filed Notices of Appeal from the 
trial court’s December 21, 2004 “final judgment,” but the 
appeals were later deemed untimely as the appealable final order *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
9 
 in the post-judgment proceeding was the November 24, 2004 Order 
denying the Schmidts’ motion for prejudgment interest.   
Between December 6, 2004 and March 18, 2005, the Schmidts 
made no effort to enforce the final judgment (whether it be the 
final order entered on November 24, 2004 or the “superfluous” 
December 21, 2004 “final judgm
ent”).  Additionally, the Schmidts 
did not engage in any formal discovery prior to March 18, 2005. 
On March 18, 2005, counsel for the Schmidts met with 
counsel for RFI regarding the Foreclosure Case.  At this 
meeting, the Schmidts’ counsel requested of RFI’s counsel copies 
of the following checks (collectively, “Transfers”):  
(1) a check dated February 11, 2000, in the amount of 
$78,000, payable to Defendant Eleanor Henderson;  
 
(2) a check dated February 15, 2000, in the amount of 
$119,393.42, payable to Goodsill, Anderson, Quinn, and Stifel;  
 
(3) a check dated February 11, 2000, in the amount of 
$54,399.55, payable to Defendant Richard Henderson;  
 
(4) a check dated March 1, 2000, in the amount of 
$165,058.42, payable to Kamehameha Schools -- Bernice Pauahi  
Bishop Estate.    
 
The Schmidts’ March 21, 2005 request for production encompassed 
a formal request for copies of the Transfers.   Thirty days later 
on April 20, 2005, the Schmidts’ counsel received the copies of 
the Transfers, and RFI’s April 22, 2005 resp onse to the 
Schmidts’ request for production stated that the requested 
copies of the Transfers had already been produced. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
10 
 On June 29, 2005, the Schmidts noticed the deposition of 
RFI’s chief financial officer, Michael Chagami, as RFI’s Hawaiʻi 
Rules of Civil Procedure (“HRCP”) Rule 30(b)(6)11 designee 
relating to RFI’s finances.  The deposition was taken on July 
26, 2005.    
Based on these facts and the following contested FOFs and 
COLs, the circuit court concluded the Schmidts’ HUFTA claim was 
time-barred.    
 FOF 5:  The Schmidts first noticed the 30(b)(6) deposition 
of RFI on August 25, 2004, approximately 5 months after remand.  
The Schmidts cancelled on September 3, 2004.  No other discovery 
was attempted between the March 18, 2004 remand order and October 
12, 2004.    
 
. . . . 
 
FOF 13:  No stay of the judgment was obtained under HRCP 
Rule 62, and the Schmidts therefore could have executed on the 
Judgment after ten days of the entry of the Judgment.  See HRCP 
Rule 62(a) (“[N]o execution shall issue upon a judgment nor shall 
proceedings be taken for its enforcement until the expiration of 
10 days after its entry[.]”).    
 
 . . . . 
 
                         
11  HRCP Rule 30(b)(6) states:  
 
A party may in the party's notice and in a subpoena name as 
the deponent a public or private corporation or a 
partnership or association or governmental agency and 
describe with reasonable particularity the matters on which 
examination is requested. In that event, the  organization 
so named shall designate one or more officers, directors, 
or managing agents, or other persons who consent to testify 
on its behalf, and may set forth, for each person 
designated, the matters on which the person will testify. A 
subpoena shall  advise a non- party organization of its duty 
to make such a designation. The persons so designated shall 
testify as to matters known or reasonably available to the 
organization. This subdivision (b)(6) does not preclude 
taking a deposition by any other procedure authorized in 
these rules.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
11 
 FOF 19:  Between March 21, 2005 and April 20, 2005, thirty 
days elapsed prior to the Schmidts receiving the transfer checks.  
This indicates that if the Schmidts had commenced proceedings to 
enforce the judgment in the Foreclosure Case on December 6, 2004, 
then they could have received copies of three or four of the 
checks associated with the Transfers on January 6, 2005.   
 
 
 . . . . 
 
FOF 21:  However, that deposition could be taken any time 
after January 6, 2005, unless doing so was prohibited by a 
protective order.  The Schmidts did not produce any evidence of a 
protective order or of any valid reason why the 30(b)(6) 
deposition could have not been taken earlier.   
 
 
FOF 22:  Generally, 45 days is more than enough time to 
schedule an oral deposition.  Affording the Schmidts up to 45 
days to schedule the Rule 30(b)(6) deposition and considering the 
2005 calendar, the Rule 30(b)(6) deposition could have reasonably 
been taken on or before February 21, 2005.    
 
FOF 23:  At minimum, the Schmidts could have reasonably 
known of the Transfers and their fraudulent nature on or before 
February 21, 2005.  To summarize, (1) final judgment was entered 
in the Foreclosure Case on November 24, 2004; 
(2) under HRCP Rule 
62, after ten days passed, the Schmidts could have executed on 
the judgment on the first business day (December 6, 2004); (3) 
the Schmidts actually discovered the Transfer checks on or before 
January 6, 2005; 
(4) because 45 days is generally more than 
enough time to notice a deposition, the Schmidts could have taken 
the decisive deposition on or before February 21, 2005.  Thus, 
the Schmidts reasonably could have known of the existence of the 
Transfers and their fraudulent nature on or before February 21, 
2005.  
  
 
. . . . 
 
COL 6:  Based on the preponderance of the evidence, the 
Schmidts
 could reasonably have discovered the existence of the 
Transfers and their fraudulent nature before April 8, 2005.    
 
 . . . . 
 
COL 8:  However, as set forth in the above findings, had 
Plaintiffs commenced proceedings to enforce the judgment in the 
Foreclosure Case on December 6, 2004, they could have obtained 
copies of the checks associated with the Transfers in January 
2005, and could have deposed RFI’s representative in January or 
February 2005.   
 
 
COL 9:  Likewise, had Plaintiffs commenced discovery into 
RFI’s assets any time after the March 18, 2004 Hawai ʻi Supreme 
Court opinion, they would have discovered the fraudulent nature 
of the Transfers prior to April 8, 2005.   
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
12 
 COL 10:  Thus, the Schmidts could have reasonably 
discovered the existence of th
e Transfers and their fraudulent 
nature more than one year prior to filing their lawsuit, and the 
Schmidts’ action in this case is time -barred under HRS § 651C -
9(1).   
 
B. Appeal to the ICA 
The Schmidts  timely file d a Notice of Appeal to the ICA, 
and presented, in relevant part, three points of error in their 
Opening Brief: 
A. The trial court committed reversible error in filing 
Findings of Fact (FOF) #s 5,  13, 19, 21, 22 and 23 . . . .  
 
. . . .  
 
B. The trial court committed reversible error in making 
Conclusions of Law (COL) 6,  8,
 9 and 10 . . . .  
 
. . . .  
 
C. The trial court committed reversible error filing the 
December 6, 2016 final judgment . . . .  
 
  The ICA rejected the challenges.  With respect to the 
Schmidts’ challenges to the FOFs, the ICA c oncluded as follows: 
“FOFs 5 and 13 are each supported by the record and not clearly 
wrong,” “FOF 19 is [not] inconsistent with FOFs 15– 18,” and 
“FOFs 19, 21, 22, and 23 are [not] based on speculation and 
therefore [not] clearly erroneous.”  Schmidt, SDO at 3.  
Further, “the [c]ircuit [c]ourt did not err in making findings 
that aided in its determination of how and when the fraudulent 
nature of the Transfers
 could reasonably have been discovered by 
the Schmidts, and we are not left with a definite and firm 
conviction that, based on all of the evidence, mistakes were 
made in these findings.”  Id.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
13 
 With respect to the Schmidts’ challenges to the COLs, the 
ICA concluded as follows:  the Schmidts failed to cite to the 
appellate record in support of their argume
nts and also failed 
to “explain or argue how [such exhibits] are significant with 
respect to the [c]ircuit [c]ourt’s FOFs or COLs regarding the 
Schmidts’ delayed discovery regarding the fraudulent nature of 
the subject transfers and their failure to file their complaint 
within the applicable statute of limitations.”  Schmidt, SDO at 
4.  Further, based on Hawai ʻi’s ju
risprudence regarding the 
“discovery rule” for generic fraud claims -- similar to the 
“discovery rule” in Freitag v. McGhie, 947 P.2d 1186 (Wash. 
1997), which this court relied on in its analysis in Schmidt II 
-- “the statute of limitations begins running when the plaintiff 
knew or should have known of the damage,” and that “[w]hen there 
has been a belated discovery of the cause of action, the issue 
whether the plaintiff exercised reasonable diligence is a 
question of fact for the court or jury to decide.”  Schmidt, SDO 
at 5–6 (citing Thomas v. Kidani, 126 Hawai ʻi 125, 133, 267 P.3d 
1230, 1238 (2011)).  Accordingly, the circuit court did not err 
in the contested COLs because “[t]he circuit court’s finding -- 
that had the Schmidts conducted a reasonably diligent inquiry in 
aid of execution after obtaining judgment in their favor they 
reasonably would have discovered the fraudulent nature of the *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
14 
 Transfers over one year before filing of the complaint in this 
action -- is not clearly erroneous.”  Schmidt, SDO at 6. 
C. The Current Appeal  
The Schmidts present  the same three issues they previously 
argued before the ICA, all related to the date the circuit court 
determined the Schmidts reasonably could have discovered the 
fraudulent nature of the T ransfers : 
Whether the [ICA] gravely erred and the magnitude of such 
error or inconsistency dictates the need for further appeal 
where the ICA affirmed: 
 
(1)  the circuit court’s findings of fact (“FOF”) nos. 5, 
13, 19, 21, 22 and 23[;]  
 
(2)  the circuit court’s conclusions of law (“COL”) nos. 
6, 8, 9 and 10[; and]  
 
(3)  the circuit court’s entry of fin al judgment denying 
[Petitioners’]  complaint against the [Respondents].  
 
In sum, the Schmidts assert they could not reasonably have 
discovered the fraudulent nature of the T ransfers until the July 
26, 2005 deposition of HSC’s chief financial officer, Michael 
Chagami, as that was the first time they learned of HSC’s 
insolvency.  Using July 26, 2005 as the date when they could 
reasonably have discovered the fraudulent nature of the 
Transfers, the Schmidts argue they were well within the one-year 
statute of limitations period when they filed their HUFTA claim 
on April 7, 2006.            *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
15 
 The Schmidts appear to make the following
 specific 
challenges to the circuit court’s  FOFs12 and COLs:  
FOF 5:13  The Schmidts assert this finding is incomplete 
because the HRCP Rule 30(b)( 6) deposition was cancelled “when 
this Court’s award of fees and costs on the earlier appeal w as 
paid by [RFI]’s [lawyers’]  trust account, so there was nothing 
to discover and at no time did [RFI]’s  lawyers ever reveal that 
[RFI] was only a corporate shell .”    
FOF 13:14  The Schmidts also assert this finding is 
incomplete because it is “useless to execute on a judgment when 
a case is on appeal,” and both parties had immediately filed 
appeals following the December 21, 2004 “final judgment,” and 
were unaware that their appeals were untimely until the appeals 
were dismissed by the Hawaiʻi Supreme Court on May 9, 2005.  The 
Schmidts appear to suggest that because the Chagami deposition 
occurred on June 29, 2005, not too long after the May 9, 2005 
Order, they had been reasonably diligent in their efforts to

pages 10 –12, is repeated in a respective footnote, with formatting and

13  FOF 5:  The Schmidts first noticed the 30(b)(6) deposition of RFI on 
August 25, 2004, approximately 5 months after remand.  The Schmidts cancelled 
on September 3, 2004.  No other discovery was attempted between the March 18, 
2004 remand order and October 12, 2004.  
 
14  FOF 13:  No stay of the judgment was obtained under HRCP Rule 62, and 
the Schmidts therefore could have executed on the Judgment after ten days of 
the entry of the Judgment.  See HRCP Rule 62(a) (“[N]o execution shall issue 
upon a judgment nor shall proceedings be taken for its enforcement until the 
expiration of 10 days after its entry[.]”).  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 execute on the Foreclosure Case judgment.  The Schmidts also 
assert, without explanation, that FOF 13 is inconsistent with 
FOFs 10,15 11,16 and 15–18.17  They additionally point out that 
they had attempted to execute on the judgment when they filed an 
Ex Parte Motion for Issuance of Execution and Garnishment on the 
Final Judgment dated August 23, 2005, but on September 1, 2005, 
the trial court denied it without prejudice to filing a separate 
action against the proper parties.    
FOF 19:18 The Schmidts assert this finding is speculation 
and that it was “proper to not enforce the appeal judgment out 
                         
15  FOF 10:  The Schmidts and RFI filed notices of appeal from the December 
21, 2004 Judgment.    
 
16  FOF 11:  On May 9, 2005, the Hawai ʻi Supreme Court entered its Order 
Dismissing Appeal in the Foreclosure Case  . . . .    
 
17  FOF 15:  On March 18, 2005, the Schmidts’ counsel met with RFI’s 
counsel in regard to the Foreclosure Case.  At that time, the Schmidts ’ 
counsel requested that RFI’s counsel provide them copies of the checks 
associated with the four transfers that are the subject of this Fraudulent 
Transfer case.    
 
FOF 16:  On March 21, 2005, in the Foreclosure Case, the Schmidts 
served RFI their [“]First Request for Production . . . .[”]  Included in the 
request for production of documents were requests which generally required 
the production of checks associated with the fraudulent transfers that are 
the subject of this action . . . .    
 
FOF 17:  On April 20, 2005, the Schmidts’ counsel received copies of 
three or four of the checks associated with the Transfers from RFI’s counsel.    
 
FOF 18:  On April 22, 2005, RFI’s counsel signed the [“]Response to 
Defendants[’] . . . First Request for Production .  . . .[”] . . . RFI 
indicated that it had already produced copies of checks relating to the 
Transfers to the Schmidts.    
 
18  FOF 19:  Between March 21, 2005 and April 20, 2005, thirty days elapsed 
prior to the Schmidts receiving the transfer checks.  This indicates that if 
the Schmidts had commenced proceedings to enforce the judgment in the 
Foreclosure Case on December 6, 2004, then they could have received copies of 
three or four of the checks associated with the Transfers on January 6, 2005.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
17 
 of respect for the appellate process.”   They reiterate that the 
circuit court erred in using November 24, 2004 to calculate the 
date the Schmidts could have executed on the final judgment, as 
the “final judgment” did not issue until December 21, 2004, and 
so any execution and garnishment “would be premature and also 
[the] Schmidts needed to know what assets to execute upon or 
garnish.”   
 
FOF 21:19 The Schmidts contend this finding is erroneous 
because the deposition could not have taken place because there 
were pending appeals before the Hawaiʻi Supreme Court until those 
appeals were dismissed on May 9, 2005.  They argue that they 
therefore “acted reasonably in delaying that until they knew 
what assets to execute upon or garnish after the appeal was 
dismissed.  That process was begun by seeking documentary 
evidence in early 2005 proving Schmidt acted reasonably in 
delaying attempting collection on the judgment.”    
FOF 22:20 The Schmidts
 assert this finding is based upon an 
erroneous analysis and speculation that forty- five days is 
sufficient time to schedule a deposition, and without any record 
                         
19  FOF 21: However, that deposition could be taken any time after January 
6, 2005, unless doing so was prohibited by a protective order.  The Schmidts 
did not produce any evidence of a protective order or of any valid reason why 
the 30(b)(6) deposition could have not been taken earlier.  
 
20  Generally, 45 days is more than enough time to schedule an oral 
deposition.  Affording the Schmidts up to 45 days to schedule the Rule 
30(b)(6) deposition and considering the 2005 calendar, the Rule 30(b)(6) 
deposition could have reasonably been taken on or before February 21, 2005.  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
18 
 evidence supporting
 this finding.   They argue that considering 
the amount of time this case spent in the trial and appellate 
levels, waiting four months out of respect for the appellate 
process was not unreasonable.    
FOF 23:21 The Schmidts repeat that the circuit court erred 
in stating the final judgment issued on November 24, 2004 
instead of December 21, 2004.  They argue that FOF 23 is 
speculation and contrary to the evidence, and repeat arguments 
made with respect to the prior contested FOFs.  In sum, the 
Schmidts assert they could not have conducted any discovery 
prior to December 21, 2004, because such discovery would have 
been impermissible prejudgment discovery.  The Schmidts 
emphasize that the fraudul
ent nature of the T ransfers  was not 
discovered until the Chagami deposition on July 26, 2005.  They 
state they were diligent in conducting “early discovery” when 
they obtained check copies on April 20, 2005 and learned of the 
payees at that time, and they c oncede that “at the earliest,” 
                         
21  FOF 23: At minimum, the Schmidts could have reasonably known of the 
Transfers and their fraudulent nature on or before February 21, 2005.  To 
summarize, (1) final judgment was entered in the Foreclosure Case on November 
24, 2004; (2) under HRCP Rule 62, after ten days passed, the Schmidts could 
have executed on the judgment on the first business day (December 6, 2004); 
(3) the Schmidts actually discovered the Transfer checks on or before January 
6, 2005; (4)
 because 45 days is generally more than enough time to notice a 
deposition, the Schmidts could have taken the decisive deposition on or 
before February 21, 2005.  Thus, the Schmidts reasonably could have known of  
the existence of the Transfers and their fraudulent nature on or before 
February 21, 2005.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
19 
 the statute of limitations period began running on April 20, 
2005.  
  
The Schmidts ’ challenge to COLs 6, 8, 9, and 10 are 
premised on the same arguments they presented with respect to 
FOF 23.  That is, that they did not discover the fraudulent 
nature of the Transfers until July 26, 2005 at the conclusion of 
the Chagami deposition.
  Given the long history of litigation, 
and the length of time the case was on appeal, the Schmidts 
argue that noticing a deposition in “9 -12 months is a reasonable 
period of time, not 45 days.”   According to the Schmidts, “the 
inquiry about whether [they] acted diligently starts on May 9, 
2005 when this Court dismissed both appeals in the [Foreclosure] 
Case,” and that therefore, their HUFTA claim is not time -barred.    
In response, Respondents provide a timeline of events 
highlighting how the Schmidts “sat idle,  making no effective 
effort to inquire into RFI’s financial condition or otherwise 
obtain information relating to collection of RFI’s debt.”   
However, in addition to explaining the correctness of the ICA’s 
decision, Respondents also raise an argument previously raised 
to the ICA, which the ICA chose not to address in its SDO:  the 
Schmidts lost standing to pursue their HUFTA claim because the 
underlying judgment awarding them the $537,000 in surplus 
foreclosure proceeds “lapsed in 2014 and . . . was vacated  . . . *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
20 
 in July 2016 pursuant to HRS § 657- 5.[22]”  Respondents argue 
that without an outstanding judgment, the Schmidts’ fraudulent 
transfer claims are now moot.    
The Schmidts timely replied that “Respondents’ cases about 
mootness are misleading, useless, and illusory because this is 
not a collection on the original judgment but a new statutory 
[H]UFTA claim . . . .”   They contend “Respondents are trying to 
divert the court’s attention from the correct foc us . . . .  
There is no way that [the] Schmidts could have known of the 
fraudulent nature of the transfers by RFI on or before February 
21, 2005.”    
III.  Standard  of Review 
We review a trial court’s findings of fact under the 
clearly erroneous standard.  A finding of fact is clearly 
erroneous when, despite evidence to support the finding, 
the appellate court is left with the definite and firm 
conviction in reviewing the entire evidence that a mistake 
has been committed.  A finding of fact is also clearly 
erroneous when the record lacks substantial evidence to 
support the finding  . . . .  Hawai ʻi appellate courts review 
conclusions of law de novo, under the right/wrong standard.

IV.  Discussion 
A. This court does  not address the effect of the vacatur of 
the Foreclosure Case judgment.  
 
As a preliminary matter, Respondents argue that the 
Schmidts lack standing to continue this appeal regarding their 
2006 HUFTA claims because the December 21, 2014 Foreclosure Case 
judgment became satisfied as a matter of law in 2014.   As noted 
by Respondents, however, the circuit court has not addressed the 
issue and the ICA did not address the issue because it ruled in 
Respondents’ favor on alternative grounds.   In addition, this 
court recently clarified that “[i]n Hawai ʻi state courts, 
standing is a prudential consideration regarding the proper -- 
and properly limited -- role of courts in a democratic society 
and is not an issue of subject matter jurisdiction, as it is in 
federal courts.”  Tax Foundation v. State, 144 Hawaiʻi 175, 188, 
439 P.3d 127, 140 (2019) (internal quotation marks omitted).  
Because (1)  the issue is not one of subject matter jurisdiction, 
(2) is not an issue adequately briefed on certiorari, (3) has 
not been addressed by the circuit court or the ICA, and (4) this 23

the Circuit Court of the First Circuit’s July 7, 2016, vacatur of the 
December 21, 2014 Foreclosure Case judgment because the Schmidts failed to

 court is vacating and re
manding to the circuit court, this court 
declines to address the issue at this time.   
B. The Schmidts timely raised their HUFTA claims.   
The crux of the Schmidts ’ challenge on certiorari is that 
the ICA erred in affirming the circuit court’s ruling as to 
“when [the] Schmidts  discovered or should have discovered . . . 
the fraudulent nature of the transfers.”    
The ICA’s SDO accurately discusses the current 
jurisprudence regarding the “discovery rule” associated with HRS 
§ 651C-9 and similar UFTA statutes.  See Schmidt, SDO at 5 –6.  
Namely, this court ruled in Schmidt II that the limitations 
period in HRS § 651C- 9(1) refers to when “a fraudulent transfer, 
and not simply a transfer” “was or could reasonably have been 
discovered by the claimant.”  Schmidt II, 131 Hawai ʻi at 507, 319 
P.3d at 426 (citing HRS § 651C
-9(1)) (emphasis in original).  In 
Schmidt II, this court concluded the interpretations by the 
Hawaiʻi federal bankruptcy court and the Washington Supreme Court 
regarding relevant UFTA provisions were consistent with the 
Hawaiʻi legislature’s purpose behind HUFTA.  See Schmidt II, 131 
Hawaiʻi at 506–07, 319 P.3d at 425 –26 (citing In re Maui Indus. 
Loan & Fin. Co., 454 B.R. 133, 137 (Bankr. D. Hawaiʻi 2011); 
Freitag, 947 P.2d at 1189).  Thus, to be consistent with the 
premise that it would be “legally absurd and unjust to interpret 
the discovery rule to preclude claims under the UFTA if *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
23 
 plaintiffs were never aware they held a potential claim,” 
Schmidt II, 131 
Hawaiʻi at 508, 319 P.3d at 427, “actual 
knowledge of the f
raud [is] inferred if the aggrieved party, 
through the exercise of due diligence, could have discovered 
it.”  Freitag, 947 P.2d at 1189 (emphasis added).  
What was not fully discussed by the ICA, however, is the 
rationale behind this court’s  holding in Schmidt II.  Although 
not expressly stated in Schmidt II, that the statute of 
limitations begins to run when the fraudulent nature of the 
transfer is discovered or reasonably discoverable, as opposed to 
when a creditor discovered the transfer, is “ more protective of 
innocent creditors.”   Schmidt II , 131 Hawai ʻi at 506, 319 P.3d at 
425 (citation omitted)
.  This means that the date by which the 
fraudulent nature of a transfer is discovered or discoverable 
should be later than the date by which the transfer alone is 
discovered.  Indeed, the purpose of HUFTA  
would be undermined if the one year period began once plaintiffs 
discovered the existence of a transfer, even if they were unaware 
of its fraudulent nature.   Under that interpretation, plaintiffs 
would lose the right to pursue a remedy in court for fraudulently 
incurred injuries even though they could not have become aware of  
the existence of their claims.   
  
Schmidt II, 131 Hawai ʻi at 508, 319 P.3d at 427.   
 Cases from other jurisdictions are in accord.  Construing  
 
Ohio’s version of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (“UFTA”),  
 
the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals stated: *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
24 
 The Ohio UFTA's overall purpose is to discourage fraud and 
provide aggrieved creditors with a means to recover assets 
wrongfully place d beyond their reach.  Accordingly, to 
require a claimant to bring suit within one year of 
discovering a transfer,  without having discovered facts 
that would put the claimant on notice as to the transfer's 
fraudulent nature, would be to interpret  § 1336.09(A) in a 
manner that is directly at odds with the  animating purpose 
of the UFTA.  
In re Fair Finance, 834 F.3d 651 , 674 (6th Cir. 2016) ; see also 
Official Comm. of Unsecured Creditors of Great Lakes Quick Lube 
LP v. Theisen, 920 N.W.2d 356, 365 (Wis. App. 2018)  (“statute of 
limitations [begins to run] from the point at which the claimant 
discovers or reasonably could have discovered the fraudulent 
nature of the transfer”) .  
The purpose of HUFTA would be further undermined if 
creditors are expected to “reasonably discover”  the fraudulent 
nature of a transfer even before  they actually uncover the 
existence of the transfer.  Yet, that is the upshot of the 
circuit court’s October 19, 2016 FOFs and COLs.  When considered 
in their entirety, it is apparent that the circuit court agreed 
with the Schmidts that they discovered the fraudulent nature of 
the Transfers at the Chagami deposition on July 26, 2005.  
However, by finding that the Schmidts could have “reasonably 
discovered” the fraudulent nature of the Transfers by February 
21, 2005 -- well in advance of the Chagami deposition and, more 
importantly, prior to March 18, 2005, when the Schmidts had 
actually discovered the mere existence of the Transfers when 
HSC’s counsel produced a February 2000 bank statement to the *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
25 
 Schmidts -- the circuit court necessarily found that the 
Schmidts could (and should) have discovered 
both the existence 
and fraudulent nature of the Transfers prior to February 21, 
2005.  Such a determination contravenes this court’ s statutory 
interpretation of HRS § 651C-9(1) and discussion of HUFTA’s 
purpose in Schmidt II.  Accordingly, the circuit court erred as 
a matter of law when it determined that the Schmidts could have 
reasonably discovered the fraudulent nature of the Transfers by 
February 21, 2005, and the ICA erred in affirming the circuit 
court in this regard.   
Here, the Schmidts did not discover the existence of the 
Transfers until March 18, 2005, and discovered the fraudulent 
nature of the Transfers shortly thereafter on July 26, 2005.24  
The circuit court made no finding that the Schmidts did not act 
diligently during this four- month period.  Indeed, the record 
shows the opposite.  On March 21, 2005, prior to the dismissal 
of the Foreclosure Case appeals, the Schmidts made a formal 
request for production, and on April 20, 2005, the Schmidts 
received copies of the checks evidencing the Transfers.  Within 
about two months, on June 29, 2005, the Schmidts noticed the 
deposition of RFI’s chief financial officer, Michael Chagami, as 
                         
24  Although the Schmidts concede that “they reasonably discovered the 
insider transfers and their fraudulent nature . . . at the earliest on April 
20, 2005 when they got copies of the front and back of the four checks 
showing the payees,” the circuit court found that the Schmidts discovered the 
fraudulent nature of the Transfers on July 26, 2005, and this court does not 
disturb that finding. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
26 
 RFI’s HRCP Rule 30(b)(6) designee relating to RFI’s finances, 
and the deposition was taken on July 26, 2005.  Such steps 
undoubtedly demonstrated “reasonable” due diligence.     
Based on the foregoing, this court conclude s that the 
statute of limitations for the Schmidts’ HUFTA claim did not 
begin until July 26, 2005, and therefore the Schmidts timely 
raised their HUFTA claims.    
V.  Conclusion 
For the foregoing reasons, this court vacates the ICA’s 
January 31, 2019 Judgment on Appeal and the circuit court’s 
December 6, 2016 Final Judgment and remands  this case to the 
circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this 
opinion.
