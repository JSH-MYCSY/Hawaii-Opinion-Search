 Revised Statutes (“HRS”) § 291E -61(a)(1).1  The issue on 
certiorari concerns foundational requirements for the admission 
of testimony under Hawai ʻi Rules of Evidence (“HRE”) Rule 612, 
when a witness testifies after reviewing a “Writing used to 
refresh memory.
”  
 After  Honolulu Police Department (“HPD”) Officer Manueli 
Kotobalavu (“Officer Kotobalavu” or “the Officer”) reviewed his 
report for the second time while testifying over defense 
objection, the District Court of the First Circuit (“district 
court”)2 allowed the Officer to  testify regarding Wakamoto’s 
field sobriety test without a  foundation having been laid that 
his memory had been refreshed by reviewing the report.  In its 
October 20, 2017 Summary Disposition Order (“SDO”), t he 
Intermediate Court of Appeals (“ICA”) affirmed Wakamoto’s 
conviction, stating that no legal authority requires the laying 
                         
1  HRS § 291E- 61(A)(1) (Supp. 2014) provides:  
 
§291E-61  Operating a vehicle under the influence of an 
intoxicant.   (a)  A person commits the offense of operating 
a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the 
person operates or assumes actual physical control of a 
vehicle: 
     (1)  While under the influence of alcohol in an amount 
sufficient to impair the person's normal mental faculties 
or ability to care for the person and guard against 
casualty; 
. . . . 
2  The Honorable Dyan K. Mitsuyama presided.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 of such a foundation.  See  State v. Wakamoto , No. CAAP -16-
0000873, at 4 (App. Oct. 20, 2017) (SDO).    
 In his certiorari application (“Application”) , Wakamoto 
reasserts a question he had posed to the ICA: 
Whether the ICA gravely erred in holding that the district 
court did not err in denying Wakamoto’s objection to an 
officer’s testimony in an OVUII case as refreshed memory 
when the officer had already reviewed his report once to 
answer the prosecutor’s que stions about the standardized 
field sobriety test?   
  
Legal authority requires that befo
re testimony is admitted 
pursuant to HRE Rule 612 after a witness review s a writing while 
testifying for the purpose of refreshing memory, an evidentiary 
foundation must be laid e
stablish ing that the witness’s memory 
has actually been refreshed.3  Therefore, the ICA erred by 
indicating that no legal authority exists requiring that such a 
foundation be laid, and the district court erred by admitting 
Officer Kotobalavu’s testimony regarding Wakamoto’s field 
sobriety test over defense objection without requiring the 
proper evidentiary foundation.   
 Despite evidentiary error, an appellate court may affirm a 
judgment of a lower court on any ground in the record that 
supports affirmance.  See State v. F ukagawa, 100 Hawai ʻi 498, 
506, 60 P.3d 899, 907 (2002) (citations omitted).  After the 
                         
3  Before the witness reviews the writing,  a foundation should be laid 
that the witness does not recall a fact or event and that the writing will 
help the witness refresh the w itness’s memory.  See Edward J. Imwinkelried, 
Evidentiary Foundations  466 (9th  ed. 2015).    ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
4 
 defense objected  to Officer Koto balavu again reviewing his 
report and questioned whether he had an independent 
recollection, t he deputy prosecuting attorney raised the 
possibility that the officer’s testimony would be  admissible 
4under HRE Rule 802.1(4) governing “Past recollection recorded”  
if it was not otherwise admissible under HRE Rule 612.   The 
State of Hawaiʻ i (“the State”) , however, did not alternatively 
argue HRE Rule 802.1(4) to the ICA or to this court, and it is 
unclear whether the testimony at issue would have been 
admissible on this basis.  In addition, the erroneous admission 
of evidence is not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt if there 
is a reasonable possibility that the error might have 
contributed to the conviction.   See State v. Subia, 139 Hawai ʻi 
62, 69, 383 P.3d 1200, 1207 (2016).  In this case, the district 
court specifically stated it relied in part on Officer 
                         
4  HRE Rule 802.1(4) provides:  
 
Rule 802.1   Hearsay exception; prior statements by 
witnesses.   The following statements previously made by 
witnesses who testify at  the trial or hearing are not 
excluded by the hearsay rule:  
 
. . . 
 
(4)  Past recollection recorded.   A memorandum or record 
concerning a matter about which the witness once had 
knowledge but now has insufficient recollection to enable 
the witness to testify fully and accurately, shown to have 
been made or adopted by the witness when the matter was 
fresh in the witness ’[s] memory and to reflect that 
knowledge correctly.   If admitted, the memorandum or record 
may be read into evidence but may not itself be received as 
an exhibit unless offered by an adverse party . ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
5 
 Kotobalavu’s improperly admitted testimony as a basis for 
convicting Wakamoto — thus, the improperly admitted testimony 
contributed to the conviction.  Therefore, the evidentiary error 
cannot be deemed harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  
 Accordingly, we vacate the ICA’s November 22, 2017 Judgment 
on Appeal entered pursuant to its SDO, as well as the district 
court’s Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order  
and Plea/Judgment,
 and we remand this case to the district court 
for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 
 
II.  Background 
A. Factual Background and District  Court Proceedings  
In a complaint dated December 21, 2015, the State charged 
Wakamoto with committing the offense of OVUII on December 2, 
2015, in violation of 
HRS § 291E -61(a)(1).  A bench trial took 
place on September 20, 2016 and November 17, 2016.  At trial, 
HPD Officer Jesse Takushi ( “Officer Takushi ”) and Officer 
Kotobalavu testified for the State .     
According to the officers’  testimonies, o n December 2, 
2015, at about 2:35 a.m., on Kalakaua Avenue fronting the Moana 
Surfrider Hotel , Officer Takushi conducted a traffic stop on a 
vehicle he observed twice unsafely crossing a broken white line.  
When Officer Takushi approached the vehicle, he observed that 
Wakamoto’s eyes were red and watery and that his pupils appeared 
dilated, and he noticed a  strong alcoholic- type odor coming from ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
6 
 Wakamoto.  According to Officer Takushi, Wakamoto ’s responses 
were delayed and slurred, and he could not locate his 
registration paperwork.  Wakamoto apparently repeatedly picked 
up and dropped his license and insurance paperwork, but he did 
hand them to Officer Takushi in a timely manner.   
Officer Takushi testified that when Wakamoto stepped out of 
the vehicle, he stated on his own accord that he “didn’t have 
anything to drink, ” but Officer Takushi continued to smell an 
alcoholic odor.  At about this point of the traffic stop, 
Officer Kotobalavu, responding to Officer Takushi ’s radio 
request for assistance, arrived on the scene.   
At the start of his trial testimony more than nine months 
after the arrest, Officer Kotobalavu could not recall the 
location of the traffic stop:  
[By the Prosecutor:]  
 
Q. Do you recall the location of this traffic  
stop? 
A. No, sir, I don ’t recall at this time.  
Q. Is there something that would help to refresh your 
memory? 
A. Yes, my report.  
Q. Okay. 
[Prosecutor]: And may the record reflect that 
I’m showing defense counsel.  
 
By [the Prosecutor]:  
 
Q. So, Officer, I ’m going to hand you your  
police report.  Just go ahead and look at it silently 
and look up at me when you ’re done. 
A. Okay. 
Q. And I’m taking the report back.  
 Officer, has your memory been refreshed?  
A. Yes. 
Q. Okay.  And do you recall where the location of the 
traffic stop was?  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
7 
 A. Yes. 
Q. Okay.  And where was that, sir?  
A. Was front -- was on Kalakaua fronting the Moana 
Surfrider hotel.  
 
The record does not reflect how long Officer Kotobalavu reviewed 
his report before resuming his testimony, but he testifi ed that 
he thought Wakamoto ’s car was a black two- door Lancer.   
Officer Kotobalavu then testified that as he spoke to 
Wakamoto, he smelled alcohol and saw that Wakamoto had red, 
watery eyes.  He testified that Wakamoto was then directed to 
walk about fifteen feet away from his car so that Officer 
Kotobalavu could conduct a field sobriety test on the dry 
concrete sidewalk in front of the Moana Surfrider, which was 
free of debris, well lit, and did not have much foot traffic.  
He further testified that before conducting the field sobriety 
test, Officer Kotobalavu asked Wakamoto a series of questions 
regarding Wakamoto ’s health.  Officer Kotobalavu also repeatedly 
asked Wakamoto whether he understood his instructions regarding 
the tests.  As Wakamoto spoke , Officer Kotobalavu continued to 
detect the odor of alcohol coming from him.   
Regarding the walk- and-turn test, Office r Kotobalavu 
testified that he instructed Wakamoto on how to place his feet, 
the direction he should face, and where to place his arms.  
Officer Kotobalavu testified that he also demonstrated the test 
and that after Wakamoto got in the correct position to begin the 
test, he instructed him not to move until he was told to start.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
8 
 Officer Kotobalavu testified that before being told to start, 
however, Wakamoto swayed about six inches in both directions and 
started the test on his own.   
 Officer Kotobalavu further testified that during the walk-
and-turn test, Wakamoto raised his arms at least once about six 
inches away from his body in order to keep his balance while 
walking and that Wakamoto took ten steps instead of the 
instructed nine, and missed a few heel- to-toes, where his heel 
missed his toe by about one inch.  According to Officer 
Kotobalavu, contrary to instructions, Wakamoto stopped in the 
middle of the test.  He testified that a
fter the ninth step,  
Wakamoto appeared unsure whether he was to turn, and then took 
an extra step to turn.   
After test ifying to the foregoing, the following exchange 
occurred:   
[By the Prosecutor:]  
 
Q  Okay. Is there anything that you recall as far as  
his performance other than the turn and the things 
that you had testified about to this point?  
A  No. 
Q  Okay. Is there something that would help refresh  
your memory?  
A  My report.  
Q  Okay. And -- 
 
[Defense counsel]:  Your Honor, at this time  
defense would object.  At this point the Officer had two  
opportunities to review the document.  I’m sure once 
before.  At this point I ’m asking is the officer --  does 
the officer have an independent recollection  of the events, 
or he’s just going off what he ’s written right  now?  He’s 
had -- I believe he has had multiple  opportunities to look 
at the document, and there is --  I do believe there’ s a 
difference between the two.  
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
9 
 [Prosecutor]:  Your Honor, if that ’s an 
issue, I understand [Defense counsel ’s] point.  If that’s 
an issue, you know, we can make this a past recollection  
recorded.  I mean, this was in December of last year,  your 
Honor, and the officer conducts these traffic stops  
routinely, so -- 
 
THE COURT:  Overruled. 
 
BY [the Prosecutor] : 
 
Q  Officer, I ’m going to hand you your -- your 
report.  Go ahead and take that -- a look at that  
silently, and then just let me know when you ’re done.  
A  Okay. 
Q  And let the record reflect I ’m taking the report  
back. 
Okay.  Officer, so any other observations that  
you made of the defendant during just 
-- just the  
walk-and-turn just portion of the test?  
A  Yes.  As he took the -- his turn, he did take one  
more extra step, so he turned the wrong way, but as 
h
e turned, it wasn ’t as instructed, short, choppy 
steps.  He spun on his right foot to turn himself 
around. 
Q  Okay. When you say that he turned the wrong way,  
which way did he turn?  
A 
 To the right.  
Q  Okay.  And which way did you instruct for him to  
turn? 
A  To the left.   If you took nine steps, you would  
automatically turn to the left.  
Q  Okay.  Anything else happened or any other  
observation that you made during this portion of the  
test? 
A  No.
 
 
Officer Kotobalavu then went on to testify regarding the one-
leg-stand test. 
Officer Kotobalavu testified  that, in performing the one -
leg-stand test, Wakamoto was required to lift either his right 
or left leg about six inches from the ground, with his  foot 
remaining parallel to the ground, and with his hands at his 
sides.  Simultaneously, Wakamoto was required to look down at 
his feet and count until Officer Kotobalavu told him to stop.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
10 
 Officer Kotobalavu testified that he then demonstrated the test 
and Wakamoto stated that he understood.   
According to Officer Kotobalavu, however, Wakamoto also 
began this test before being instructed to start.  He testified 
that, throughout the test, Wakamoto kept his arms raised further 
than six inches away from his body to keep his balance and that 
he hopped to maintain his balance and set his foot down twice,  
primarily during the first twenty (20) seconds of the test.  The 
officer testified that Wakamoto also  swayed at least three times 
throughout the test.  Officer Kotoba lavu stopped the test after 
thirty (30) seconds,  and arrested Wakamoto.   
During Officer Kotobalavu ’s cross- examination , defense 
counsel began a line of questioning regarding the specific 
circumstances of the traffic stop, such as whether the vehicle 
had four or two doors.  After the prosecutor objected, defense 
counsel explained: 
[Defense counsel]:  This goes to my -- the -- this 
goes to the witness ’s ability to recall -- recall 
information.  What he puts down is pertinent.  I believe 
that there is  no independent recollection  (indiscernible) 
problems, and my only -- this is my  opportunity to cross to 
make sure -- to show proof that there are inconsistencies 
in his report and in his testimony.  
 
THE COURT: I’ m going to allow it.  Go ahead. 
 
Officer Kotobalavu then explained that he had previously 
testified and had written in his report that the vehicle was a 
two-door, but according to HPD ’s vehicle license plate search, 
Wakamoto’ s vehicle was a four- door.  Defense counsel  asked ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
11 
 Officer Kotobalavu whether he had asked Wakamoto whether he had 
allergies and whether he had just finished a double shift at 
work.  Officer Kotobalavu also testified on cross -examination 
that he remembered Wakamoto saying that he had just come from a 
bar to pick up a friend and Wakamoto could have actually been 
outside the car when he first approached instead of inside, as 
he had earlier testified.  
 During additional cross -examination on the second trial 
date, Officer Kotobalavu testified during cross -examination that 
the space between the missed heel -to-toes may have been  a half-
inch instead of an inch, as he had earlier testified .  He also 
reiterated that he told Wakamoto which way to turn and 
demonstrated how to execute the test correctly.   
Wakamoto then also testified .  During direct examination, 
Wakamoto testified that Officer Kotobalavu did not specify the   
foot on which  he needed to step first or which direction to turn 
during the walk -and-turn test.  Wakamoto testified that the 
officer also only  instructed him to keep his arms at his side.  
He also testified that he was driving on the night in question 
because he gave a ride home to a friend who was intoxicated, the 
most direct route between the bar and his friend’s home was down 
Kalakaua Avenue,  and he was familiar with the area.   
After considering all of the testimony, the court found 
Wakamoto guilty as charged.  The district court explained its  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
12 
 ruling at length.  In considering the testimony, the court found 
that Wakamoto’s breath smelled  like alcohol, and that he had 
red, watery eyes.  As to the use of Officer Kotobalavu ’s report 
to refresh his recollection, the court stated:  
It is true Officer Kotobalavu indicated sometimes he needed 
to reference his report and he couldn ’t remember.  Granted 
that this happened in December of 2015, I totally 
understand that.  He did indicate, though, that when he 
performs these [field sobriety tests], he specifically 
instructs, demonstrates, and then instructs again.   
   
The court note d several aspects of the walk- and-turn test that 
Officer Kotobalavu had testified to before reviewing his report  
a second time: that Wakamoto had started the walk- and-turn test 
too soon, missed the heel- to-toe by one inch at least one time, 
raised his arms away from his body by at least six inches at 
least one time, stopped in the middle of the test, and took ten 
steps instead of the instructed nine.     
 The court also referenced as a basis for the conviction, 
however, Officer Kotobalavu’s testimony after his  second review 
of his report, i.e., that because Wakamoto took an  extra step, 
it followed that he turned  the wrong way.     
 The court then discussed the results of the one -leg-stand 
test, and found that Wakamoto started the test before 
instructed, consistently raised his arms through the test, 
hopped, and put his foot down before the end of the test.  The 
court sentenced Wakamoto to a one -year revocation of license, a ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
13 
 minimum fourteen- hour substance abuse assessment program, and 
various fines and fees.  His sentence was stayed pending appeal.   
B. Appeal to the ICA and Application for Writ of Certiorari 
 Wakamoto timely filed a Notice of Appeal to the ICA, and 
presented a single argument, which he again raises on 
certiorari:  
The district court erred in denying Wakamoto ’s 
request to determine if the [standard field sobriety test] 
officer was testifying from his memory or from a 
past 
recollection recorded.  
 
Wakamoto argued: 
In this case, Officer Kotobatavu [sic] was permitted 
to see his report a second time to try to refresh his 
memory of Wakamoto ’s [field sobriety test]  over defense 
objection that it was unclear if his memory was  actually 
refreshed or he was testifying to a past recollection for 
which he had no present personal knowledge.  Instead of 
overruling the defense objection, the district court should 
have asked, or let defense counsel ask, if his memory was 
actually refreshed or not.  It was error for the court not 
to do, and it involved a critical piece of evidence.  
   
The ICA rejected the challenge .  The ICA indicated  that there 
was “no evidence, such as an admission that he relied solely on 
his report or a failure to 
recall other details about his 
arrival on the scene, to suggest that [Officer  Kotobalavu] based 
his testimony only on what he read in the report. ”  Wakamoto, 
SDO at 2 (citations omitted).  The ICA also stated that before  
looking at his report the second time, Officer Koto balavu 
“recalled numerous details about the incident, including 
Wakamoto’s appearance and odor, how he conducted and Wakamoto 
performed the [horizontal gaze] test, and other aspects of ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
14 
 Wakamoto’s performance of the Walk-and-Turn test.”  Wakamoto, 
SDO at 3 (citations omitted).  The ICA 
then stated , "It is 
reasonable under the circumstances to infer that the [field 
sobriety test] report merely jogged Officer Kotobalavu’s memory.  
Wakamoto provides no authority for the contention that an 
officer is required to say whether his recollection was 
refreshed after looking at the report, and we find none. ”  
Wakamoto, SDO at 4 (emphasis added).   
In his Application, Wakamoto  reasserts the argument made to 
the ICA: 
Whether the ICA gravely erred in holding that the district 
court did not err in denying Wakamoto ’s objection to an 
officer’ s testimony in an OVUII case as refreshed memory 
when the officer had already reviewed his report once to 
answer the prosecutor ’s questions about the standardized 
field sobriety test?  
 
(some capitalization removed).   Wakamoto asserts in his 
Application that “ no foundation had been laid ” for Officer 
Kotobalavu’s testimony regarding the field sobriety test after  
his second review of his police report.     
III.  Standard  of Review 
 Errors on evidentiary rulings are subject to the abuse of 
discretion standard unless the application of the evidentiary 
rule in question can produce only one correct answer, in which 
case, we review the alleged error under the “right/wrong” 
standard.  Kealoha v. County of Hawai ʻi, 74 Haw. 308, 315, 319 –
20, 844 P.2d 670, 674, 676 (1993);  State v. Dibenedetto, 80 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
15 
 Hawaiʻi 138, 145, 906 P.2d 624, 631 (App. 1995) (citing Kealoha , 
74 Haw. at 315, 8 44 P.2d at 674).  Because a witness cannot be 
permitted to testify if the witness has no present recollection, 
we apply the “right/wrong” standard in determining the 
correctness of a ruling regarding the admissibility of testimony 
under HRE Rule 612.  See  Kealoha, 7 4 Haw. at 319–20, 844 P.2d at 
676.   
IV.  Discussion 
A. Evidentiary foundation required by HRE Rule 612  
 As indicated above, the first time Officer Kotobalavu 
reviewed his report, he testified in response to the deputy 
prosecuting attorney’s question that his memory had been 
refreshed before continuing to testify.  The second time he 
asked to see his report, defense counsel objected, raising 
questions regarding whether the officer actually had a present 
memory or whether he was testifying off of his report.  The 
court overruled the objection, and the officer continued to 
testify regarding Wakamoto’s field sobriety test without stating 
that his memory had been refreshed by reviewing his report. 
 Wakamoto asserts that the district court erred by 
overruling his objection and allowing Officer Kotobalavu to 
testify regarding the field sobriety test after reviewing his 
report the second time because HRE Rule 612 requires  a 
foundation to have been laid that the Officer’s  memory was ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
16 
 actually refreshed before he resumed his testimony.  T he ICA 
stated “Wakamoto provides no authority for the contention that 
an officer is required to say whether his memory was refreshed 
after looking at the report, and we find none. ”  Wakamoto, SDO 
at 4.  As explained below, however, legal authority does require 
such a foundation. 
 First, the language of HRE Rule 612 provides in relevant 
part: 
If a witness uses a writing to refresh the witness ’[s] 
memory for the purpose of testifying, either:  
    
 (1)  While testifying, or 
     (2)  Before testifying, if the court in its discretion 
determines it is necessary in the interests of justice,  an 
adverse party is entitled to have the writing produced at 
the hearing, to inspect it, to cross -examine the witness 
thereon, and to introduce in evidence those portions which 
relate to the testimony of the witness.  . . . .  
 HRE Rule 612 sets out procedural requirements that must be 
followed when a writing is used to refresh a witness’s  testimony  
while testifying.  At first blush, the rule does not seem to 
address whether a foundation must be laid that a witness’s 
memory has been refreshed after reviewing the writing.  However, 
a witness’s memory is not necessarily refreshed after reviewing 
a writing, and the plain language of the rule indicates it 
governs a writing used to refresh a witness’s memory .  In other 
words, HRE Rule 612 is triggered only when a writing actually 
refreshes the witness’s memory .  Thus, the language of HRE Rule ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
17 
 612 alone requires that a foundation be laid that a witness’s 
memory has been refreshed after reviewing a writing. 
 In Dibenedetto, the ICA  provided further guidance on this 
issue.  That appeal arose out of a defendant’s conviction by a 
jury for Driving Un
der the Influence of Intoxicating Liquor 
(“DUI”) under HRS § 291 -4, the law in effect at the time.  See 
Dibenedetto, 80 Hawai ʻi at 141, 906 P.2d at 627.  A police 
officer testified regarding the defendant’s performance on a 
field sobriety test.  See  id.  Based on the officer’s responses, 
defense counsel argued that the officer was not testifying from 
his present recollection but off of the written police report, 
and moved to strike the officer’s testimony.  See id.  The trial 
court denied the motion to strike, ruling that the matter was 
for the jury to determine, see 80 Hawai ʻi at 142, 906 P.2d at 
628,  which was one of the issues on appeal addressed by the 
ICA, 80 Hawaiʻ i at 144 -45, 906 P.2d at 630- 31.  
 After reviewing the officer’s testimony, in which the 
officer indicated that his testimony was based on what he had 
recently read in his report, the ICA concluded that the officer 
did not have a “present recollection” of the field sobrie ty test 
at the time he testified, t hen addressed whether the trial court 
had erred in failing to strike the officer’s testimony regarding 
the field sobriety test.  Dibenedetto, 80 Hawaiʻ i at 144, 906 
P.2d at 630.   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
18 
  The ICA then discussed HRE Rule 612, stating:   
[HRE] Rule 612  indicates that a witness  may use a writing 
to refresh his memory for the purpose of testifying.   A 
writing, such as a police report, used to refresh a 
witness’ s memory is ordinarily not submitted into evidence.  
3 J. Wigmore,  Evidence in Trial at Common Law  § 763, at 142 
(Chadbourn rev. ed. 1970).  When used to refresh the 
witness’ s present recollection, a writing is solely 
employed to jog the memory of the testifying witness.   1 J. 
Strong, McCormick on Evidence  § 9, at 29 (4th ed. 1992) .  
Accordingly, when a writing is used to refresh a witness ’s 
recollection, the witness should testify from a memory thus 
revived, resulting in testimony from present recollection, 
not a memory of the writing itself.   Id.  A witness’ s 
recollection must be revived after he or she consults the 
particular writing or object offered as a stimulus so that 
the resulting testimony relates to a present recollection.  
3 J. Weinstein & M. Berger,  Weinstein ’s Evidence ¶ 612[01], 
at 612-16 (1995).   If the writing fails to rekindle the 
witness’ s memory, the witness cannot be permitted to 
testify as to the contents of the writing unless the 
writing is otherwise admitted into evidence.   28 C. Wright 
& V. Gold,  Federal Practice and Procedure: Evidence  § 6183, 
at 463 (1993) . 
 
80 Hawaiʻ i at 144, 906 P.2d at 630 ( internal quotation marks, 
brackets, and ellipses omitted). 
 The ICA held  that the question of whether the officer was 
properly allowed to testify about the field sobriety test was 
not a question of credibility for the jury to decide, as the 
State maintained, but o ne of admissibility for the judge to 
determine pursuant to HRE Rule 104(a), which mandates that 
preliminary questions concerning the admissibility of evidence 
be determined by the court.  See 80 Hawai ʻi at 144-45, 906 P.2d 
at 630-31 .  The ICA further cited to HRE Rule 601, which 
provides that “[e]very person is competent to be a witness 
except as otherwise provided in the [HRE].”  Id.  The ICA then 
cited to HRE Rule 602, which provides in relevant part : ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 Rule 602  Lack of personal knowledge.   A witness may not 
testify to a matter unless evidence is introduced 
sufficient to support a finding that the witness has 
personal knowledge of the matter.   Evidence to prove 
personal knowledge may, but need not, consist of the 
witness’  own testimony. . . . 
 
The ICA furt her noted that the Commentary to HRE Rule 602 (1993) 
defines “personal knowledge” of a witness to “mean[] that the 
witness perceived the event about which [the witness] testifies 
and [the witness] has a present recollection of that 
perception.”  Commentary to HRE Rule 602 (citations omitted).   
 Based on its review of the officer’s testimony , the ICA 
concluded that the requisite foundation of personal knowledge 
based on a presently refreshed memory had not been met and that 
under the “right/wrong” standard of review, the trial court had 
erred by not striking the officer’s testimony regarding the 
field sobriety test.  Dibenedetto , 80 Hawai ʻi at 145, 906 P.2d at 
5631.  
 Thus, a s indicated by the ICA and the authorities it cited 
in Dibenedetto, and as stated in the language of HRE Rule 612, 
testimony of a witness is admissible under that rule only when 
                         
5  This court cited to Dibenedetto’s analysis of HRE Rule 612 in State v. 
Espiritu, 117 Hawaiʻ i 127, 137, 176 P.3d 885, 895 (2008).  In Espiritu, the 
defendant
 alleged various mistakes in the admission of testimony under HRE 
Rule 612, including that, on one occasion, the prosecutor never asked if the 
complaining witness’s memory had been  refreshed after reviewing the police 
report.  See
 Espiritu, 117 Hawai ʻi at 138, 176 P.3d at 896.  This court ruled  
that, despite this omission , the witness’s testimony “was nearly identical 
both before and after viewing the [police] report” and thus the evidence 
showed that the witness was not “merely reading from the report.” 117 Hawai
ʻi 
at 137, 176 P.3d at 89 5.   In this case, however, the requisite foundation 
that Officer Kotobavalu was testifying from a refreshed memory after 
reviewing his report is not demonstrated by his testimony.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 the writing has actually refreshed the witness’s memory.  A 
witness must testify based on personal knowledge, which by 
definition means the witness perceived an event and has a 
present recollection of that perception.  See Commentary to HRE 
Rule 602.  Therefore, after reviewing a writing while 
testifying, testimony of the witness laying a
 foundation that 
the witness’s 
memory has actually been refreshed after reviewing 
the writing is required before the witness’s testimony can be 
admitted under HRE Rule 612.  
 This conclusion is supported by HRE Rule 104 (a), which 
provides in relevant part: “(a) Questions of admissibility 
generally.  Preliminary questions concerning . . . the 
admissibility of evidence shall be determined by the court.  . . .”  
1 Kenneth S. Broun et al., McCormick on Evidence § 9 (7th ed. 
2016) (“It is a preliminary question for [the trial judge] under 
Rule 104(a) whether the memorandum actually does refresh.”) .  
Actual refreshment of memory is a preliminary question 
concerning the admissibility of testimony under HRE Rule 612, 
which the  court must determine prior to allowing the witness to 
testify pursuant to that rule.  Thus, HRE Rule 104(a ) also 
requires a showing that a witness’s memory has been refreshed 
before testimony can be admitted under HRE Rule 612.    
 In addition, Professor Addison Bowman discusses  HRE Rule 
612 in his Hawaii Rules of Evidence Manual as follows : ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

  Refreshing a witness’[s ] recollection at trial is an 
alternative to leading. . . .  When a witness experiences a 
memory lapse or omits to  mention a detail expected by the 
proponent, the witness can be led  or refreshed.  The 
material used to  refresh can be anything that awakens a 
memory or prods a current awaren ess of a detail that should 
be included in the witness’[s] narrative.  See, e.g., State 
v. Keohokapu , 127 Hawai[ʻ ]i 91, 276 P.3d 660 (2012)  (police 
report that contained witness’[s] statements); State v. 
Espiritu, 117 Hawai[ ʻ]i 127, 176 P.3d 885 (2008)  (police 
report that recited contents of text messages the 
complaining witness received from the defendant) .  
Typically, the refres hing document  will be a prior 
statement of the witness.  
 
 Admissibility of the refreshing material is of no 
concern if the technique succeed s because the witness will 
be instructed to read the document to herself and then will 
be asked if her memory is refreshed.  See State v. Lam, 75 
Haw. 195, 207 n.10, 8 57 P.2d 585, 592 n.10 ( 1993) (authen- 
tication of document unnecessary because it “merely serves 
to refresh the witness’[s] present memory and is not 
evidence”).  If she answers “Yes,” then the examination 
will proceed  in the usual fashion  . . . .  If, on the other 
hand, the effort to refresh fails to stimulate an 
independent,  present recollection in the witness, testimony 
that merely parrots the contents of the document will not 
be admitted over a rule 602 obj ection asserting lack of 
personal knowledge.  State v. Espiritu, 117 Hawai[ʻ ]i 127, 
137, 176 P.3d 885, 895 (2008)  (dictum).  For this 
proposition, Espiritu cited State v. Dibenedetto , 80 
Hawai[ʻ]i 138, 906 P.2d 624 (App. 1995)  (police officer had 
his report but no memory of a field sobriety test he had 
conducted); compare State v. Ferrer , 95 Hawai[ʻ ]i 409, 431 -
33, 23 P.3d 744, 766 -68 (App. 2001)  (officer remembered 
administering Intoxilyzer test with result “over.08” 
although he  needed refreshing abou t the accused’s “exact 
score on the test”). . . .  
 
Addison M. Bowman, Hawaii Rules of Evidence Manual, at  6-82 to 
6-83 (2016-2017 ed.) (emphasis added).  
 Professor Imwin kelried’s text , Evidentiary Foundations, is 
also in accord, indicating that “[t]he witness states that 
viewing the document . . . refreshes his or her memory” before 
the witness then testifies from revived memory.  Imwinkelried, 
supra, at 466. ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

  As in Dibenedetto , a review of Officer Kotobalavu’s  
testimony regarding Wakamoto’s field sobriety test after the 
defense objection renders it unclear whether he was testifying 
from a present recollection of what he had perceived, or whether 
he was testifying from his memory of what he had read regarding 
his report.  Proper foundation was not laid for his continued 
testimony regarding Wakamoto’s field sobriety test that Officer 
Kotobalavu’s recollection had been refreshed because the trial 
court did not require that he be asked whether his recollection 
had been refreshed after the defense raised the HRE Rule 612 
objection.  
 Therefore, the district court erred by overrul ing the 
defense objection and by admitting Officer Kotobal avu’s 
continued testimony without requiring a foundation that Officer 
Kotobalavu’s memory had been refreshed after reviewing his 
report.  The ICA also erred by affirming the district court and 
by indicating that no legal authority exists requiring such an 
evidentiary foundation.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 B. The error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt  
 
 The erroneous admission of evidence is not harmless beyond 
a reasonable doubt if there is a reasonable possibility that the 
error might have contributed to the conviction.   See State v. 
Subia, 139 Hawai ʻi at 69, 383 P.3d at 1207.  In this case, the 
district court specifically stated it partly relied on Officer 
Kotobalavu’s testimony after his second review of his report 
(that because Wakamoto took an extra step, it followed that he 
turned the wrong way) as a basis for convicting Wakamoto of 
OVUII.  Therefore, despite the existence of additional evidence 
for the conviction, the evidentiary error cannot be deemed 
harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.   
V.  Conclusion 
 For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the ICA’s November 22, 
2017 Judgment on Appeal entered pursuant to its SDO, as well as 
the district court’s Notice of Entry of Judgment  and/or Order 
and Plea/Judgment, and we remand this case to the district court 
for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
