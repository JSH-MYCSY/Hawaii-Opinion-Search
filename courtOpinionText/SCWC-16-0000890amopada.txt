2 AMENDED  OPINION OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J.  1
 
I.  Introduction 
 
 This case  addresses the enforceability of a non-compete 
agreement restricting  Lorna Gagnon (“Gagnon”), a former employee 
of Prudential Locations , LLC (“ Locations ”), from “establishing 
her own brokerage firm in the State of Hawai ‘i within one year 
after terminating her employment with Locations ” and from 
soliciting persons “employed” or “affiliated with” Locations.  
At issue are two restrictive clauses within the non-compete 
agreement:  a non-compete clause and a non
-solicitation clause. 
We hold as follows:  (1) the ICA erred in failing to 
address whether the non- compete and solicitation clauses were 
ancillary to a legitimate purpose not violative of HRS Chapter 
480, as required by HRS § 480 -4(c) (Supp. 2015) ; (2) restricting 
competition is not a legitimate ancillary purpose, as 
HRS § 480-4(a) prohibits  contracts in restraint of trade or 
commerce in the State; (3) to establish a violation of a non-
solicitation clause, there must be evidence  that the person 
subject to the solicitation clause actively initiated contact; 
and (4) s ummary judgment was properly granted in favor of Gagnon 
as to the non-compete clause,  but summary judgment should not 
have been granted for  one agent as to the non- solicitation 
                                                 
1  This opinion has been amended to change only the final paragraph.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
3 clause due to a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether 
Gagnon actively initiated contact
.   
We therefore vacate  the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ 
(“ICA”) July 2, 2020 judgment  on appeal and the Circuit Court of 
the First Circuit’s (“circuit court”) December 9, 2016 final 
judgment in favor of Gagnon and remand to the circuit court only 
with respect to the alleged breach of the solicitation clause as 
to one agent.  We otherwise affirm the judgments of the ICA and 
the circuit court. 
II.  Background  
 Locations  is a real estate brokerage firm with offices in 
Kapahulu, Pearlridge, Mililani, Kailua, and Kapolei.  Gagnon 
worked as a real estate salesperson in New Hampshire from 1989 
and later became a licensed real estate broker in 1999.  
Gagnon 
had previously owned an independent brokerage business, and from 
2003 to 2008, she owned and operated a RE/MAX real estate 
franchise in New Hampshire.   
In 2008, Gagnon moved to Hawai‘i after interviewing with 
Locations while on the mainland
, then accepted a “sales coach” 
position with Locations.  On August 8, 2008, Gagnon signed a  
“Confidentiality and Non-Competition Agreement .”  The 
Confidentiality and Non -Competition Agreement contained four 
parts:  (1) recitals; (2) confidentiality and proprietary 
rights; (3) agreement not to compete (“ Non-Compete Agreement ”); *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
4 and (4) remedies of company.  
The Non-Compete Agreement was 
comprised of non-compete and non-solicitation clauses.  In 
summary, the clauses prohibited Gagnon from establishing her own 
brokerage firm in the State of Hawai‘i and from soliciting other 
persons affiliated with Locations to terminate their 
affiliations to work with her.  The clauses prohibited these 
acts for a one-year period after her employment termination.
  
The Confidentiality and Non -Compete Agreement provided as 
follows: 
CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON -COMPETITION AGREEMENT 
THIS CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON -COMPETITION AGREEMENT 
(the “Agreement”), is made and entered into as of the date 
set forth below, by and between Prudential Locations Real 
Estate, LLC, a [ Hawai‘i] limited liability company, the 
employer described below (“Company”) and the employee 
described below (“Employee”).

Company or any of its subsidiaries; and (v) patterns, 
devices, compilations of information, copyrightable 
material and technical information, if any, in any way 
relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries 
(hereinafter col lectively referred to as the “Confidential

(Emphasis in original. )  
 In June 2013, Gagnon terminated her employment with 
Locations, and in August 2013, she opened a new RE/MAX franchise 
in Hawai ‘i called Prestige Realty Group, LLC (“Prestige”) .  A few 
Locations real estate agents also left Locations to open 
Prestige.   
A. Circuit court proceedings  
 Locations  filed a complaint in the circuit court against 
Gagnon and Prestige on August 23, 2013, claiming  Gagnon violated 
the Non-Compete Agreement by establishing Prestige and 
soliciting Locations’ agents.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
7  After  discovery, Locations  filed a motion for partial 
summary judgment seeking enforcement of the Non- Compete 
Agreement.  Locations contended  the Non- Compete Agreement was 
tailored to its legitimate business interests, and  that Gagnon 
had acknowledged the reasonableness of its duration, scope,  and 
geographic area by signing it .  Locations asserted  it had a 
legitimate interest in  protecting confidential business 
information and preventing  “its managerial personnel from taking 
actions harmful to its business, such as forming a competing 
real estate broke rage firm and poaching Locations’ agents.”   
 Locations acknowledged that :  (1) pursuant to Technicolor, 
Inc. v. Traeger, 57 Haw. 113, 122, 551 P.2d 163, 170 (1976), a  
non-compete c lause must protect a legitimate business interest 
and be reasonable; and  (2) to be reasonable, a no n-compete 
clause must not:  (a) be “greater than required for the 
protection of the person for whose benefit it is imposed[;]” ( b) 
“impose undue hardship on the person restricted[;]” ( c) have a 
“benefit to the covenantee [that] is outweighed by injury to the 
public[. ]”  Locations claimed  enforcing the n on-compete clause  
against Gagnon was necessary because she  had access to 
“technologies and techniques”  tailored to Locations and its 
“website-related technology that provides analysis and reports 
concerning preferences of its consumers. ”   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
8  
Locations also maintained the Non-Compete Agreement did not 
impose undue hardship on Gagnon because it only prevented her 
from starting a brokerage firm that would compete with 
Locations, but it did not restrict her from working for an 
already existing firm.   
Locations also
 contended Gagnon violated the n on-
solicitation clause, citing Gagnon’s deposition testimony 
regarding conversations in which Locations’ former agents 
expressed interest in joining Gagnon after l earning she was 
leaving Locations.   
 Gagnon filed a memorandum in opposition to Locations’ 
motion for partial summary judgment and a cross -motion for 
summary judgment.  Gagnon contended that through the deposition 
testimony of William Chee (“Chee”)  and Dan Tabori (“Tabori”), 
Locations’ President and Vice-President of Business Operations,  
Locations admitted the sole purpose of the Non -Compete Agreement 
was to prevent new competition,  thereby restricting  trade and 
commerce in violation of HRS § 480-4(a).2  Gagnon cited  Chee’s 
statement that, “when someone goes out and starts their own 
firm, it provides a bigger threat to our company, which we’re 
trying to protect against
,” and Tabori’s testimony  that, “we 
                                                 
2  HRS § 480- 4(a) provides:   “Every contract, combination in the form of 
trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce in the 
State, or in any section of this State is illegal. ” *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
9 want to make sure that we don’t bring people on who learn what 
we do and then go ahead and start their own company.”  
Furthermore, 
Gagnon pointed out that of the eighteen 
coaches employed by Locations, only some were bound by non-
compete agreements , and Locations ’ executives, including T abori, 
were not under non- compete covenants.  Gagnon argued that if 
employees and managers with similar or  more access to 
confidential information than her were not restricted by non-
compete agreements , then Locations had no legitimate interest in 
the Non-Compete Agreement with her .   
Gagnon alternatively argued that if there was a legitimate 
interest, the non-compete clause  was unreasonable because it 
encompassed the entire State of Hawai ‘i , was unduly burdensome 
because her only source of income came from Prestige, and it 
limited the public ’s ability to choose a provider of  real estate 
services.  Gagnon also maintained with respect to the non-
solicitation clause that she did not solicit any of Locations’ 
agents and, because Locations’ agents were independent 
contractors, they were not “employees” or “persons affiliated 
with” Locations under the clause. 
 The circuit court held a hearing on the parties’  motions 
for summary judgment on August 3, 2016.3  Locations maintained  it 
                                                 
3  The Honorable Karl K. Saka moto presided.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
10 had a legitimate interest in protecting its confidential 
information.  However
, Locations admitted the Non- Compete 
Agreement did not mention confidentiality and that it “didn’t 
move [for summary judgment] on whether Ms. Gagnon used 
confidential material or misappropriated confidential material. ”  
Locations argued that, even without evidence that Gagnon used 
any of its confidential information, Gagnon violated the Non-
Compete Agreement.  
 On August 25, 2016, t he circuit court issued its findings 
of fact (“FOFs” ), conclusions of law ( “COLs”), and orders 
denying Locations’ motion for partial summary judgment and 
granting Gagnon’s cross -motion for summary judgment.  The 
circuit court’s findings included the following:  
33.  Locations has produced no evid
ence that Defendants 
were in possession of and had been using any confidential 
or proprietary information, or any trade secrets of 
Locations.  
34.  Locations does not contend that any of the Defendants 
are using any technology, concept, method, training or idea 
of Locations.  
35.  Locations does not dispute that there was no trade 
secret violation.  
36.  All coaches at Locations have access to the same 
information at Locations.  
. . . . 
39.
  At least six noncompete agreements were in effect at 
any one time for persons with the same access to the same 
information, with the same job description, the same 
responsibilities, and the same geographic scope.  
40.  Former and current employees and managers at 
Locations, including other sales  coaches, were and 
currently are not bound by or party to any non -compete 
agreement.  
41.  Of the 18 coaches, some were bound to one of the 6 
versions of non -compete agreements and some were not  bound 
by any non -compete restriction.  
. . . . 
48.  Ms. Gagnon could take all that she knew or learned 
while at Locations and could work independently as an *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
11 employee or independent contractor for an existing real 
estate brokerage firm in 
Hawai‘i. 
49.  At present, Ms. Gagnon’s only means of support for 
herself and her five children “is the income, if any, that 
[she] may earn working at Prestige.”  
50.  Enforcement of the Noncompete Clause [] would likely 
result in the forced forfeiture of Ms. Gagnon’s real estate 
broker’s license in [Hawai ‘i]. 
51.  Enforcement of the Noncompete Clause would require Ms. 
Gagnon to leave the State of [
Hawai‘i]
 to find work as a 
real estate broker.  
52.  Enforcement of the Noncompete Clause would place an 
undue hardship on Ms. Gagnon by severely limiting her 
earning potential in the only industry in which she has 
worked in the last 27 years.  
 
 The circuit court concluded that Locations ’ sole interest 
in enforcing the non- compete clause was to prevent competition 
and therefore lacked a legitimate protectible interest and was 
illegal under HRS § 480-4(a).  The circuit court
 also 
alternatively deemed
 the non-compete clause unreasonable under 
Traeger, 57 Haw. at 122
, 551 P.2d at 170, because it:  (1) was 
greater than required for  Location’s  protection; (2) imposed an 
undue hardship upon Gagnon ; and (3) the benefit to Locations was 
outweighed by the injury to the public.  T he circuit court also 
found the non-solicitation c lause unreasonable and an illegal 
restraint on trade and commerce.   
The circuit court issued its judgment in favor of Gagnon on 
December 9, 2016.  On December 28, 2016, the circuit court also 
granted in part Gagnon and Prestige’s motion for attorney’s fees 
and costs.  Locations appealed the circuit court’s decision to 
the ICA.   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
12 B. ICA proceedings  
On April 15, 2020, the ICA issued its memorandum opinion.  
Prudential Locations, LLC v. Gagnon, CAAP -16-0000890 (App. Apr. 
2020) (mem.).  The ICA held that the non-compete clause was 
reasonable because its geographical scope was limited to 
the 
State of Hawai ‘i and its one- year duration was “no longer than 
other such covenants approved by Hawai‘i courts.”   Prudential 
Locations, LLC, mem. op. at 14.  The ICA further ruled that the 
non-compete clause did not impose undue hardship on Gagnon and 
the benefit to Locations was not outweighed by any injury to the 
public.  Id.  The ICA held the non -solicitation clause valid for 
the same reasons.  Prudential Locations, LLC, mem. op. at 15.  
The ICA did not, however, address whether Locations had a 
legitimate protectible interest.  
The ICA vacated the circuit court’s FOFs, COLs, and orders 
on the parties’ motions for summary judgment and the circuit 
court’s award of attorney’s fees and costs.  Id. 
III.  Standard of Review 
A circuit court ’s grant or denial of summary judgment is 
reviewed de novo.  Ralston v. Yim, 129 Hawai ʻi 46, 55, 292 P.3d 
1276, 1285 (2013).   Furthermore,  
Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, 
depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on 
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there 
is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the 
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. A 
fact is material if proof of that fact would have the *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
13 effect of establishing or refuting one of the essential 
elements of a cause of action or defense asserted by the 
parties. The evidence must be viewed in the light most 
favorable to the non -moving party. In other words, we must 
view all of the evidence and inferences drawn therefrom in 
the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.

Hawaiʻi
 at 55-56, 292 P.3d at 1285- 86 (cleaned up).   
 
In sum, this court ’s case law indicates that a summary 
judgment movant may satisfy their initial burden of 
production by either (1) presenting evidence negating an 
element of the non -movant’s claim, or (2) demonstrating 
that the non -movant will be unable to carry their burden of 
proof at trial. Where the movant attempts to meet their 
burden through the latter means, they must show not only 
that the non -movant has not placed proof in the record, but 
also that the movant will be  unable to offer proof at 
trial. Accordingly, in general, a summary judgment movant 
cannot merely point to the non -moving party’ s lack of 
evidence to support their initial burden of production if 
discovery has not concluded. (Merely asserting that the 
non-moving party has not come forward with evidence to 
support its claims is not enough.).

IV.  Discussion 
Gagnon’s Application  presents four questions:  
A.  Whether the ICA’s Opinion that held a Non -Compete 
Agreement whose sole admitted intent by its drafter was to 
prevent competition legal and enforceable was directly 
inconsistent with the Hawai‘i statutory and case law.   
 
B.  Whether the ICA committed a grave error in failing to 
address the absence of any legitimate protectible interest 
in support of the Non -Compete Agreement.  
 
C.  Whether the ICA committed a grave error in its analysis 
of the “reasonableness” of the Non -Compete Agreement.  
 
D.  Whether the ICA committed a grave error in failing to 
determine the protect ible interest for the Non -Solicitation 
clause and in enforcing a restriction against the 
solicitation of “employees” and “affiliates” against “real 
estate brokers.”  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
14 A. Summary judgment was properly granted in favor of Gagnon as 
to the non -compete clause  
  
1. The enforceability of non- compete covenants in Hawai ‘i 
and other states 
 
Under the common law, restrictive covenants in  employment 
agreements were considered valid as long as they were 
reasonable.  
Edwards v. Arthur Andersen, LLP, 189 P.3d 285, 290 
(Cal. 2008).  The more recent trend in the United States has 
been toward restricting the enforceability of non -compete 
covenants.  See  Rachel Arnow- Richman, The New Enforcement 
Regime: Revisiting the Law of Employee Competition (And the 
Scholarship of Professor Charles Sullivan) With 2020 Vision, 50 
Seton Hall L. Rev.  1223 (2020) (discussing different states’ 
approaches to non- competition covenants).   
While the majority of states continue to apply some form of 
the common law reasonableness analysis, others  have moved toward 
bans on all or  specific types of non- compete covenants.  For 
example, California law provides that “ every contract by which 
anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession, 
trade, or business of any kind is to that extent void[,] ” with 
statutory exceptions for non- compete agreements related to the 
sale and dissolution of corporations, partnerships, and limited 
liability corporations.  C AL. CIVIL CODE § 16600 (West through Ch. 
19 of 2021 Reg. Sess.); Edwards , 189 P.3d at  291 (“[O]ur courts 
have consistently affirmed that section 16600 evinces a settled *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
15 legislative policy in favor of open competition an
d employee 
mobility.”).4 
Under Hawai ʻi law, pursuant to HRS § 480
-4(a), “ Every 
contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or 
conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce in the State, or 
in any section of this State is illegal. ”  HRS § 480-4(c)  then 
enumerates several types of restrictive covenants that may be 
lawfully entered into “ancillary to a legitimate purpose not 
violative of this chapter.”5  (Emphasis added.)   
                                                 
4  North Dakota, Oklahoma, and Washington D.C. have also passed 
legislation generally prohibiting non -compete covenants.  N.D. CENT. CODE § 9-
08-06 (2019); O KLA. STAT. tit. 15, § 217 (2001); D.C. CODE § 32-581.02 (2021).   
Other states have prohibited non -compete covenants for certain categories of 
employees.  For instance, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New 
Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Washington have enacted legislation prohibiting 
employers from entering into no n-compete covenants with employees below 
certain income levels.  820 ILL. COMP. STAT. 90/10 (2017); M E. STAT. tit. 26, § 
599-A (2019); M D. CODE ANN., LAB. & EMPLY. § 3-716 (2019); M ASS. GEN. LAWS ch. 149, 
§ 24L (2021); N.H. R EV. STAT. ANN. § 275:70 (2019);  28 R.I. GEN. LAWS § 28-59-3 
(2020); W ASH. REV. CODE § 49.62.020 (2020).   
 
5  HRS § 480- 4(c) provides:  
 
Notwithstanding subsection (b) and without limiting the 
application of subsection (a), it shall be lawful for a 
person to enter into any of the following restrictive 
covenants or agreements  ancillary to a legitimate purpose 
not violative of this chapter,  unless the effect thereof 
may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to 
create a monopoly in any line of commerce in any section of 
the State : 
 
(1) A covenant or agreement by the transferor 
of a business not to compete within a 
reasonable area and within a reasonable period 
of time in connection with the sale of the 
business;  
(2) A covenant or agreement between partners 
not to compete with the partnership within a 
reasonable area and for a reasonable period of 
time upon the  withdrawal of a partner from the 
partnership;  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
16 In Traeger, 57 Haw. 113, 551 P.2d 163, we considered 
whether the permissible restrictive covenant exceptions in 
HRS 480-4(c)6 are exclusive.  We held “the restrictive covenants 
and agreements enumerated under [HRS §] 480- 4(c) were not meant 
to be exclusive in their respective fields.”  57 Haw. at 121, 
551 P.3d at 170.  We noted the drafters of HRS § 480-4(c) 
“intended to have courts analyze all restrictive covenants that 
are not listed as ‘per se violations,’ and determine their 
validity” based on whether the covenant was “reasonable” as  a 
matter of law.  Id.  We held that a restrictive covenant is not 
reasonable if:  “(i) it is greater than required for the 
protection of the person for whose benefit it is imposed; (ii) 
it imposes undue hardship on the person restricted; or (iii) its 
                                                 
(3) A covenant or agreement of the lessee to be 
restricted in the use of the leased premises to 
certain business or agricultural  uses, or 
covenant or agreement of the lessee to be 
restricted in the use of the leased premises to 
certain business uses and of the lessor to be 
restricted in the use of premises reasonably 
proximate to any such leased premises to 
certain business uses;  
(4) A covenant or agreement by an employee or 
agent not to use the trade secrets of the 
employer or principal in competition with the 
employee's or agent's employer or principal, 
during the term of the agency or thereafter, or 
after the termination of employment, within 
such time as may be reasonably necessary for 
the protection of the employer or principal, 
without imposing undue hardship on the employee 
or agent.

17 benefit to the covenantee is outweighed by injury to the 
public[.]”7  Traeger, 57 Haw. at 122, 551 P.3d at 170 (cleaned 
up).  
Then in 7’s Enterprises, Inc. v. Del Rosario , 111 Hawai ʻi 
484, 493 143 P.3d 23, 32 (2006), we held in relevant part that, 
while not exhaustive, “training that provides skills beyond 
those of a general nature is a legitimate interest which may be 
considered in weighing the reasonableness of a non- competition 
covenant, when combined with other factors weighing in favor of 
a protectible business interest such as trade secrets, 
confidential information, or special customer relationships. ”   
Hence, although the permissible restrictive covenant exceptions 
provided in HRS 480- 4(c) are not exclusive, HRS § 480-4(c) 
requires that a restrictive covenant or agreement in restraint 
of commerce or trade be “ancillary to a legitimate purpose not 
violative of [Chapter 480].”  E ven if a  restrictive covenant 
otherwise satisfies the Traeger three- factor reasonableness 
                                                 
7  Traeger upheld the non -compete clause in question as reasonable, 
concluding there was “ample evidence as to these factors and other 
facts necessary for the court to have made its ‘reasonableness 
analysis.’”  Traeger, 57 Haw. at 122, 551 P.2d at 170.  But see Hazel 
G. Beh & H. Ramsey Ross, Non-Compete Clauses in Physician E mployment 
Contracts Are Bad for Our Health , 14 HAW. B.J. 79, 83-85 (2011)

jurisdictions that is deferential to employers and elevates freedom of 
contract principles above the traditional judicial stance that rendered 
them suspect”).

18 test, it is unenforceable unless  it is ancillary to a legitimate 
purpose not violative of Chapter 480.8 
2. The non-compete clause  was not ancillary to a legitimate 
purpose 
 
The ICA did not address whether the non -compete and non-
solicitation clauses within th is Non-Compete Agreement were 
“ancillary to a legitimate purpose” as required by 
HRS § 480-4(c).   
 Locations argues its  legitimate purpose  was to prevent 
Gagnon from using proprietary information obtained as a sales 
                                                 
8  In 2015, Hawaiʻ i joined the trend toward restricting the enforceability 
of non
-compete agreements.  HRS § 480- 4 was amended to preclude non- compete 
and non- solicitation clauses in the technology industry.  The new HRS § 480-
4(d) (Supp. 2015) provides  in relevant part:  
 
Except as provided in subsection (c)(4), it shall be 
prohibited to include a noncompete clause or a nonsolicit 
clause in any employment contract relating to an employee 
of a technology business. The clause shall be void and of 
no force and effect.  
 
In enacting this amendment, the legislature noted that “ Hawai[ʻ]i has a 
strong public policy to promote the growth of new businesses in the economy, 
and academic studies have concluded that embracing employee mobility is a 
superior strategy for nurturing an innovation -based economy.”  2015 Haw. 
Sess. Laws Act 158, § 1.  It also found that “restrictive employment 
covenants impede the development of technology businesses within the State by 
driving skilled workers to other jurisdictions and by requiring local 
technology businesses to solicit skilled workers from out of t he State.”   Id.  
The legislature acknowledged Traeger’s holding that non -compete agreements 
can be enforced if they are reasonable.  Id.  However, the legislature then 
stated, “[e]mployer trade secrets are already protected under the federal 
Uniform Trade Secrets Act and under section 480 -4(c)(4), [HRS]; therefore, 
the benefits to the employer from noncompete or nonsolicit agreements are 
duplicative and overreaching protections that may unreasonably impose undue 
hardship upon employees of technology businesses and the Hawai ‘i economy.”  
Id.  While Act 158 of 2015 bans non -compete agreements in the technology 
industry only, the legislature stressed Hawai ‘i’s strong public policy in 
promoting the growth of new businesses.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
19 coach, from forming a competing firm, and from “poaching” its 
agents. 
 
Locations argued it had an i nterest in “protecting . . . 
its proprietary systems, its customer management, the training 
modules it’s developed over 40 years, the information that was 
provided on a system- wide basis, including managerial reports to 
Ms. Gagnon about how to optimize the success of its sales 
force,” as well as Gagnon’s “access to confidential materials, 
proprietary materials that were the secret sauce, if you will, 
of why Locations is one of, if not the most, successful local 
real estate companies in Hawaii.”   Locations argued that it 
sought to protection against unfair competition, which it 
contended was knowledge and skills Gagnon allegedly acquired as 
a Locations employee:  
She had been an entrepreneur running her own franchise in 
New Hampshire for four years. What she didn't know was how 
to be a real estate again in this market. She came to 
Hawaii. We paid her hundreds of thousands of dollars to 
learn our systems and train our sales agents, and then she 
left. 
 
(Emphasis added). 
 Even if non-trade-secret, confidential business information 
constitutes a “legitimate business interest” for purposes of a 
non-compete agreement under Hawai ʻi law
, the record in this case 
does not reflect a genuine issue of material fact as to the 
existence of such non-trade-secret, confidential business 
information.  Contrary to the dissent, the information that *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
20 Locations asserts constitutes a protectible legitimate purposes 
was not actually “confidential.”  As noted  by the circuit court, 
other Locations employees and managers with similar or more 
access to the allegedly 
confidential information were not 
restricted by non- compete agreements.9  For example, only some of 
the eighteen sales coaches employed by Locations were subject to 
non-compete agreements.  Further , despite Locations’ purported 
confidentiality concerns, the non-compete clause only prohibited 
Gagnon from starting her own firm, but permitted her to work for 
an existing brokerage firm  even within one year of leaving 
Locations.  In addition, Locations did not produce any evidence 
of and did not dispute that there was no trade secret 
violation.10   
                                                 
9  As indicated in the circuit court’s FOF 43 quoted above, two coaches 
hired after Gagnon had no -post employment restriction agreements.  Also, as 
indicated in FOFs 37 and 40, the supervisor of the sales coaches as well as 
former or current employees were not bound by any non -compete agreements.  
The record does not reflect that Gagnon was provided with any unique or 
specialized training by Locations.  Gagnon actually brought with her to 
Locations twenty- five years of prior experience in the real estate industry 
and was hired as a “sales coach.”  Moreover, Locations held monthly corporate 
sales meetings, open to real estate agents from other brokerage firms, where 
training materials were shown via a PowerPoint presentation to all attendees, 
including real estate agents from other firms.  
10  Under Hawaiʻ i law:  
 
“
‘Trade secret’ means information, including a formula, 
pattern, compilation, program device, method, technique, or 
process that:  
(1) Derives independent economic value, actual or 
potential, from not being generally known to, and 
not being readily ascertainable by proper means 
by, other persons who can obtain economic value 
from its disclosure or use; and  
(2) Is the subject of efforts that are reasonable 
under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
21 Locations also argue d that a protectible “legitimate 
purpose” was to prevent Gagnon from f orming a competing firm.  
Tabori stated during his deposition that preventing competition 
from new firms was a purpose of the n on-compete agreement:    
Q.  You said that the rationale for having a noncompete 
that prevents someone from forming a new entity such as Ms. 
Gagnon’s restrictive covenant is that you don ’t want 
someone to start up a new competing enterprise against you, 
essentially with your stuff. Fair?  
A.  That would be the reason to put that language into the 
noncompete that Lorna Gagnon signed,  fair.  
 
Preventing competition, however,  is not a legitimate ancillary 
purpose under HRS § 480 -4(a).  The plain language purpose of 
HRS § 480-4(A) is to prohibit contracts in  restraint of commerce 
or trade in the State.   
 Hence, although based on different reasoning than the 
circuit court, we hold that summary judgment was properly 
granted in favor of Gagnon with respect to the non- compete 
clause. See Kahaikupuna v. State , 109 Hawai ʻi 230, 233 –34, 124 
P.3d 975, 978–79 (2005) (affirming summary judgment on different 
grounds 
than the trial court and explaining that an appellate 
court may affirm a grant of summary judgment  on any ground 
appearing in the record)  (cleaned up).11   
                                                 
 
HRS § 482B- 2 (2008).  
 
11  We note that as  part of the reasonableness analysis, Gagnon had argued 
that consumers should be able to choose their own providers of real estate 
services.  With respect to non -competes in professional services contracts 
generally, the Washington Court of Appeals has sta ted, “public policy 
requires [a court] to carefully examine covenants  not to compete, even when *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
22 B. A genuine issue of material fact exists as to one agent 
 with respect to the non -solicitation clause  
 
1. Non-solicitation clauses also require a legitimate 
ancillary purpose 
  
 Gagnon also asserts  the ICA “failed to address the 
independent legality of the non- solicitation clause. ”12 
 Solicitation clauses are also contracts in restraint of 
trade or commerce that require a legitimate ancillary purpose 
under HRS § 480-4(a).  As explained above, preventing 
competition is not a legitimate ancillary purpose,  and the 
alleged purpose of protecting confidentiality lacks merit in 
this case.  
                                                 
protection of a legitimate business interest is demonstrated, because of 
equally competing concerns of freedom of employment and free access of the 
public to professional  services.”  See Knight, Vale & Gregory v. McDaniel , 37 
Wash. App. 366, 370, 680 P.2d 448, 452 ( Wash Ct. App. 1984).  S ee also 
Professor Beh’s article with respect to medical professionals, supra note 6.  
We also note that Rule 5.6 of the Hawai ʻi Rules of Professional Conduct 
provides: 
 
A lawyer shall not participate in offering or making:  
      (a)   a partnership, shareholders, operating, 
employment, or other similar type of agreement that 
restricts the right of a lawyer to practice after 
termination of the relationship, except an agreement 
concerning benefits upon retirement or as permitted by Rule 
1.17 of these Rules; or  
      (b)   an agreement in which a restriction on the 
lawyer’s right to practice is part of the settlement of a 
client controversy.  
 
Thus, the Hawai ʻi legal profession does not allow non -compete 
agreements. 
12  Gagnon also maintains that real estate agents are not “employees” or 
“affiliates” covered by the non -solicitation clause, and that the non -
solicitation clause was unreasonable if it applied to the solicitation of 
agents.  These arguments lack merit and we do not address them further. 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
23  Workforce stability and customer relationships can, 
however, be legitimate ancillary interests for an agreement 
prohibiting the solicitation of employees.  See, e.g., Arpac 
Corp. v. Murray, 589 N.E.2d 640, 649-50 (Ill. App. Ct. 1992) 
(holding that a non- solicitation agreement was “enforceable and 
not void” because it “was reasonably calculated to protect [the 
employer’s] interest in maintaining a stable work force”); 
Genesee Valley Tr. Co. v. Waterford Grp.,  14 N.Y.S.3d 605, 609 
(N.Y. App. Div. 2015) (“A covenant not to solicit employees is 
inherently more reasonable and less restrictive than a covenant 
not to compete, and an employer has a legitimate interest in 
preventing an employee from leaving to work for a competitor if 
the employee has cultivated personal relationships with clients 
through the use of the employer's resources.”) (citations and 
quotations omitted).  
2. “Solicitation” requires an active initiation of contact   
 
 In th is case, the n on-solicitation c lause prohibited Gagnon 
from soliciting other persons employed or affiliated with 
Locations by “induc[ing] or encourage[ing][them] to terminate 
their relationship with the Company. ”13  Three agents, including 
Sherrie Au (“Au”) , joined Gagno n at Prestige after learning she  
was leaving Locations.  These agents’ termination of their 
                                                 
13  Merely “encouraging” someone to leave employment cannot 
constitute “solicitation”; employees are “encouraged” by family and 
friends to switch emplo yers for various reasons.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
24 employment with Locations and subsequent employment with 
Prestige do not automatically demonstrate a violation of the 
non-solicitation clause .   
 Our law does not clearly define “solicitation.”  We agree 
with reasoned opinions from other jurisdictions and now hold 
that “solicitation” requires an active initiation of contact .  
Thus, to withstand summary judgment for a violation of the non-
solicitation clause, evidence indicating that Gagnon actively 
initiated contact with the agents that joined her must have 
existed.   See UARCO Inc. v. Lam, 18 F. Supp. 2d 1116, 1121 (D. 
Haw. 1998) (holding a non- solicitation agreement enforceable 
where the former employees’ admitted to calling company’s 
customers and informing them of their new employment); Prosonic 
Corp. v. Stafford, 539 F. Supp. 2d 999, 1004 (S.D. Ohio 2008) 
(holding that employe r’s claim that a former employee solicited 
other employees was “mere speculation” because employer failed 
to produce evidence that former employee personally induced 
employees to leave the company); Atmel Corp. v. Vitesse 
Semiconductor Corp., 30 P.3d 789, 793 (Colo. App. 2001) 
(interpreting “solicitation” to require actively initiated 
contact).  
Here, the record reflects a genuine issue of material fact 
with respect to Gagnon’s active initiation of contact only with 
respect to Au.  The conversations  Gagnon had with the subject *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
25 agents to inform them that she was leaving Locations
 do not, by 
themselves, constitute active initiation of contact or 
“solicitation.”  With respect to Au, however, on July 2, 2013, 
about one month before her last day at Locations, Gag
non emailed 
Au, saying “Any chance you have Friday this week open?  There is 
something I want to discuss with you and it cannot wait till 
next week as planned.”  Three days later, Gagnon and Au met for 
lunch.  Regarding her conversation with Au, Gagnon provided the 
following declaration: 
On July 5, 2014, I had lunch with Sherrie Au.  During 
lunch, I informed Sherri of my decision to leave Prudential 
and my plans for opening up a RE/MAX franchise.  I 
explained to her my plans.  Sherrie stated that she always  
said that she would go with me if I left Locations.  I 
responded by stating that Kevin and I could not think of 
any other person we would rather have be our partner.  
Sherrie and I did not at that time discuss any 
organizational structure of a new company.  There was no 
understanding at the time as to what role Sherrie would 
have or if she would even join me in the new company.  
Sherrie then sent me a set of points and questions that she 
wanted answered by me before she reached any decision.  
 
(Emphasis added.)  Although Au attested she left Locations on 
her own volition and that Gagnon did not solicit her to leave , 
the record reflected possible active initiation of contact of Au 
by Gagnon, precluding summary judgment.  Thus, this case is 
remanded to the circuit court only with respect to the alleged 
violation of the solicitation clause as to Au.
