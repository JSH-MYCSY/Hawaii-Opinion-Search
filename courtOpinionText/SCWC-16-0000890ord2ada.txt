CONCURRENCE IN PART TO ORDERS GRANTING MOTIONS 
FOR CLARIFICATION OF THE OPINION OF THE COURT 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., with whom Nakayama, J., joins) 
  
 
 I concur in the Majority’s orders granting Respondent/ 
Plaintiff-Appellant Prudential Locations, LLC N/K/A Locations Electronically Filed
Supreme Court
SCWC-16-0000890

Dkt. 94 ORDC2 
 LLC’s (Locations) motion for clarification filed on February 28, 
2022, and Petitioners/Defendants-Appellees Lorna Gagnon and 
Prestige Realty Group Limited Liability Company’s motion for 
clarification filed on February 28, 2022, in order to amend 
language in the majority opinion filed on February 17, 2022, 
relating to the non-solicitation agreement and Sherrie Au, and 
to attorneys’ fees and costs. 
However, for reasons set forth in my concurrence and 
dissent filed on February 17, 2022, I conclude that Locations’ breach of contract claims against Gagnon based on the non-
compete clause may be enforceable.  For that reason, I would 
grant Respondent/Plaintiff-Appellant Prudential Locations, LLC 
N/K/A Locations LLC’s motion for clarification and vacate the 
circuit court’s grant of summary judgment to Gagnon with respect 
to the non-compete clause. 
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawaiʻ i, March 31, 2022.
