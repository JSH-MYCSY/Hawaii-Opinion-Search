OPINION OF THE COURT BY EDDINS, J. 
An Administrative Driver’s License Revocation Office 
hearing officer revoked Brent Sylvester’s driver’s license after
finding probable cause to support Sylvester’s arrest for 
operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant.   
Three civilian witnesses wrote statements on a standard 
Honolulu Police Department form (HPD-252).  They described 
Sylvester’s conduct and interactions with them after he Electronically Filed

 purportedly rear-ended their car.  Two police officers’ sworn 
statements referenced the witnesses’ accounts.   
The hearing officer considered the civilian witnesses’ HPD-
252 statements.  The hearing officer also considered the 
witnesses’ statements incorporated in the police officers’ sworn 
statements.  Sylvester objected. 
 The District Court of the First Circuit sustained the 
license revocation.  The Intermediate Court of Appeals affirmed 
the district court’s decision.  
We address whether administrative driver’s license 
revocation hearing officers can consider civilian witnesses’ 
unsworn statements when making probable cause determinations. 
We hold they can.  The administrative license revocation 
laws – namely, HRS §§ 291E-36, 291E-37(c), and 291E-38(g)1 - do 
not require sworn statements from civilian witnesses.  Instead, the sworn statement requirement only covers (1) law enforcement 
officers, (2) persons who administer alcohol or drug tests, and (3) those who maintain the testing equipment.   
I. 
In April 2016, three people traveled in a Nissan on the H-1 
freeway.  A Toyota rear-ended them; it did not stop.  The Toyota sped past the Nissan.  One person in the Nissan called 911 and

 reported “a hit and run.”  The Nissan followed the Toyota.  The 
caller told the 911 operator that the Toyota was “swerving” and 
“almost slammed [into] the median.”    
 
Later the Nissan’s three occupants wrote statements on an 
HPD-252 form.  Each detailed the rear-end collision and the 
Toyota’s flight.  The witnesses also described following the 
Toyota to a Kailua residence.  There they briefly confronted the 
driver.  Because of how he smelled, spoke, and walked, the witnesses believed he was intoxicated.  When police officers 
arrived, they identified Sylvester as the driver.  
The HPD-252 forms contained a preprinted declaration: “I 
attest that this statement is true and correct and to the best 
of my knowledge, and that I gave this statement freely and 
voluntarily without coercion or promise of reward.”
2  The 
witnesses signed their names. 
HPD officers responded to Sylvester’s residence.  For the 
administrative revocation proceedings, two officers submitted 
sworn statements.3  They detailed the circumstances surrounding 
Sylvester’s arrest.  One officer described the damages to the two cars.  The other officer wrote that he smelled alcohol on 
                                                 
2  Our decision does not hinge on deciding whether this attestation 
language makes the witnesses’ statements “sworn.”   
3  At the end of their statements, the officers signed their names and 
swore that the information in their statements was “true and correct.” *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 Sylvester’s breath as he spoke to him.  The officer further 
reported: “[Sylvester] blurted out that he just had a ‘few’ when 
he got home.”  Sylvester declined a field sobriety test and a 
preliminary alcohol screening test.  The officer arrested him 
for operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant 
(OVUII).  He read an implied consent and other required notice 
forms to Sylvester.  Sylvester refused to take a breath or blood 
test.
  The officer issued him a notice of administrative 
revocation.  
 Four days later, an Administrative Driver’s License 
Revocation Office review officer revoked Sylvester’s driver’s license.  
Sylvester requested an administrative hearing.  At the 
hearing, he moved to strike the three witnesses’ HPD-252 
statements.  Sylvester also moved to strike the civilian 
witnesses’ statements contained in the sworn police statements.  
The hearing officer denied the motion.  
 After considering the HPD-252 statements, 911 recording, 
and sworn police statements,
4 the hearing officer found probable 
cause that Sylvester operated his vehicle while under the 
influence of alcohol.  The officer sustained the initial 
                                                 
4  The hearing officer struck other police officers’ unsworn statements 
contained in the sworn police statements.  The hearing officer also granted 
Sylvester’s request to strike several unsworn police reports prepared by 
other HPD officers.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
5 
 administrative revocation of Sylvester’s driver’s license. 
 
Although their rationale differed, the district court and 
the ICA affirmed the hearing officer’s decision.  The district 
court ruled that “other person[s],” whose sworn statements the 
hearing officer must consider under HRS § 291E-38(g),5 include 
the civilian witnesses.  It also ruled that their HPD-252 statements were not sworn.  Despite these determinations, the 
district court upheld the license revocation.  It reasoned that the sworn police statements incorporating “the witnesses’ 
statements and/or information” provided a sufficient basis to 
find probable cause for Sylvester’s arrest.
  
The ICA implicitly rejected the district court’s reasoning 
that HRS § 291E-38(g)’s sworn statement requirement encompassed 
civilian witnesses.  It read the term “other person” in HRS 
§ 291E-38(g) to mean only “the person who conducted the 
[intoxication] test” or “the person responsible for the 
maintenance of the testing equipment” as specified in HRS § 291E-36.  We agree with the ICA.  
II. 
In administrative driver’s license revocation proceedings, 
we hold that hearing officers can consider civilian witnesses’ 
                                                 
5  The district court, the Honorable Lono J. Lee presiding, relied on the 
following sentence in HRS § 291E-38(g): “The director shall consider the 
sworn statements in the absence of the law enforcement officer or other 
person.”  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
6 
 unsworn statements.       
After inspecting the texts and context of HRS §§ 291E-36, 
291E-37(c), and 291E-38(g), we conclude that these laws do not 
impose a sworn statement requirement on civilian witnesses.  
They only require sworn statements from (1) law enforcement 
officers, (2) persons who administer alcohol or drug tests, and 
(3) those who maintain the testing equipment.  Civilian 
witnesses’ statements - both independently through HPD-252 statements and as embedded in sworn police statements – can 
support probable cause in license revocation proceedings. 
HRS Chapter 291E, Part III guides the administrative 
driver’s license revocation process.  It begins when an 
individual is arrested and issued a notice of administrative 
revocation.
6  See generally HRS §§ 291E-31, 291E-33, 291E-34.  
Next, an administrative review officer examines the police officer’s decision to issue the revocation notice.  HRS § 291E-
37(a).  This initial review happens automatically.  Id.  Based 
solely on documentary evidence, including documents listed in 
HRS § 291E-36, the administrative review officer decides whether 
to revoke the driver’s license.  See generally HRS § 291E-37.  
If the review officer revokes the license, the driver can request an administrative hearing.  HRS § 291E-38(a).  If a 
                                                 
6  We call an arrestee who received a notice of administrative revocation 
a “driver.”     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
7 
 hearing officer affirms the revocation after that administrative 
hearing, the driver can petition for judicial review.  HRS 
§ 291E-40(a).          
Within the administrative driver’s license revocation 
framework, a trio of intertwined laws - HRS §§ 291E-36, 291E-
37(c), and 291E-38(g)  - identify the types of documents that the 
administrative review and hearing officers must receive, consider, or admit into evidence.   
HRS § 291E-36 lists what evidence must be submitted for 
administrative review immediately after an OVUII arrest.
7  It 
calls for sworn statements from:   
(1) “the arresting law enforcement officer” and “the 
officer who issued the notice of administrative 
revocation,” HRS § 291E-36(a)(1), (b)(1)8;  
 
(2) “the person responsible for maintenance of the [alcohol 
or drug] testing equipment,” HRS § 291E-36(a)(2), (4); and  
 (3) “the person who conducted the [alcohol or drug] test,” 
HRS § 291E-36(a)(3), (5).
9  
 
HRS § 291E-36 identifies no other person whose statement must be 
                                                 
7  HRS § 291E-36 also applies when a driver is arrested for habitually 
operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant under HRS § 291E-
61.5.  
 
8  HRS § 291E-36(a) applies when an arrestee submits to an alcohol or drug 
test.  HRS § 291E-36(b) governs when an arrestee refuses to do so.  Both 
require the arresting officer to submit a sworn statement.  Conspicuously, 
only HRS § 291E-36(a) mentions sworn statements of “the officer who issued 
the notice of administrative revocation.”    
9  The persons identified in subparagraphs (2) and (3) are not implicated 
when a driver refuses an alcohol or drug test, like Sylvester did.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
8 
 sworn.  
 
In addition to these sworn statements, the administrative 
review officer receives other types of evidence: “a copy of the 
arrest report,” HRS § 291E-36(a)(1), (b)(1); “the report of the 
law enforcement officer who issued the notice of administrative 
revocation to the person involved in a collision resulting in 
injury or death,” HRS § 291E-36(a)(1); “a copy of the notice of 
administrative revocation,” HRS § 291E-36(a)(6), (b)(2); any license taken into possession by law enforcement officers, HRS 
§ 291E-36(a)(7), (b)(3); and the driver’s prior alcohol and drug 
enforcement contacts.  HRS § 291E-36(a)(8), (b)(4).   
With the information received under HRS § 291E-36 and any 
evidence submitted by the driver, the administrative review 
officer conducts an initial review.  HRS §§ 291E-36, 291E-37.  
At this stage, HRS § 291E-37(c) requires consideration of:  
(1) “Any sworn or unsworn written statement or other 
written evidence provided by the respondent”;  
 
(2) “The breath, blood, or urine test results, if any”; 
and 
 
(3) “The sworn statement of any law enforcement officer or 
other person or other evidence or information required 
by section 291E‑ 36.”  (Emphases added.)  
      
If the driver wants an administrative hearing after an 
adverse administrative review decision, HRS § 291E-38(g) 
requires the hearing officer to 
admit into evidence the sworn 
statements generated by HRS § 291E-36 and consider them if the *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
9 
 individuals who made the sworn statements do not appear at the
hearing.  10 
 Both HRS §§ 291E-37(c)(3) and 291E-38(g) refer to the sworn statements of “other person” and HRS § 291E-36.  The 
Administrative Director of the Courts maintains that “other 
person” means only those individuals identified in HRS § 291E-
36: the government employees conducting alcohol or drug tests or 
maintaining the testing equipment.  Sylvester, in contrast, reads “other person” expansively to mean everyone who is not a 
law enforcement officer.  He contends that civilian witnesses’ 
statements submitted by the government must be sworn.  
 The Director’s interpretation prevails: “other person” 
does not mean a civilian witness.  We conclude that HRS § 291E-
38(g), like HRS § 291E-36, does not touch civilian witnesses’ 
statements. 
 
Turning to HRS § 291E-38(g), its opening sentence - “The 
sworn statements provided in section 291E-36 shall be admitted 
                                                 
10  HRS § 291E-38(g) states: 
  
The sworn statements provided in section 291E- 36 
shall be admitted into evidence.  The director shall 
consider the sworn statements in the absence of the 
law enforcement officer or other person.  Upon 
written notice to the director, no later than five 
days prior to the hearing, that the respondent wishes 
to examine a law enforcement officer or other person 
who made a sworn statement, the director shall issue 
a subpoena for the officer or other person to appear at the hearing. . . .      
 
(Emphasis added.)  Additionally, HRS § 291E-38(f) requires that the driver’s 
prior alcohol and drug enforcement contacts be entered into evidence.   10 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
into evidence” – delimits its scope to HRS § 291E-36.  (Emphasis 
added.)  “[T]he sworn statements” mentioned in the next sentence 
– “The director shall consider the sworn statements in the  
absence of the law enforcement officer or other person” –
grammatically link back to “the sworn statements provided in  
section 291E-36” in the preceding sentence.  HRS § 291E-38(g).  
So “other person” in the second sentence refers to the  
individuals who submitted sworn statements under HRS § 291E-36.
See McGrail v. Admin. Dir. of the Courts, 130 Hawai ʻi 74, 80, 305  
P.3d 490, 496 (App. 2013) (explaining that “the hearing officer  
must admit into evidence and consider the sworn statements  
required by HRS § 291E-36” (emphasis added)).1211
HRS § 291E-37(c)(3)’s sworn statement requirement, like HRS 
§ 291E-38(g), unites with HRS § 291E-36.  HRS § 291E-37(c)(3)  
states: “The sworn statement of any law enforcement officer or  
other person or other evidence or information required by  
section 291E-36.” (Emphases added.)
Sylvester argues that HRS § 291E-37(c)(3) requires the 
administrative review officer to consider “1) the sworn 
11The first two sentences of HRS § 291E-38(g) establish the context in 
which the rest of the provision (concerning when a hearing officer must issue 
a subpoena for “a law enforcement officer or other person who made a sworn 
statement”
) should be read.    
12In McGrail, the ICA held that considering a police officer’s unsworn 
statements in another police officer’s sworn statement is impermissible.  130 
Hawaiʻi at 81, 305 P.3d at 497.  McGrail did not involve civilian witnesses.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
11 
 statement of any law enforcement officer or other person or 2) 
other evidence or information required by section 291E-36.”  He 
reads the provision’s ending phrase - “required by section 291E-
36” – to modify only the latter part of the preceding terms, 
“other evidence or information,” but not the other antecedent 
terms, “[t]he sworn statement of any law enforcement officer or 
other person.”  Sylvester’s interpretation of HRS § 291E-
37(c)(3) is flawed.        
The series-qualifier canon undercuts Sylvester’s view.  
This canon provides that “when there is a straightforward, parallel construction that involves all nouns or verbs in a 
series, a modifier at the end of the list normally applies to 
the entire series.”  Facebook, Inc. v. Duguid, 141 S. Ct. 1163, 
1169 (2021) (cleaned up).       
 Here, HRS § 291E-37(c)(3) contains a parallel, connected list of nouns in a series: “[t]he sworn statement of any law 
enforcement officer or other person or other evidence or information.”  So the modifier, “required by section 291E-36,” 
applies to each of the antecedent noun phrases.
13  Said 
                                                 
13  Generally, a determiner ( for example, “other” before “evidence” in this 
sentence) “tends to cut off the modifying phrase so that its backward reach 
is limited.”  Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The 
Interpretation of Legal Texts 149 (2012).  Yet “that effect is not entirely 
clear.”  Id.  “ The rule of the last antecedent is context dependent.” 
Facebook, 141 S. Ct. at 1170.   As discussed below, the context of HRS §§ 291E-
36, 291E- 37(c), and 291E- 38(g) shows that the determiner before “evidence” in 
HRS § 291E-37(c)(3) does not sever the modifier’s reach.     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
12 
 differently, HRS § 291E-36 covers both (1) the sworn statements 
of law enforcement officers or “other person” (other government 
officials who conduct alcohol or drug tests or maintain the 
relevant testing equipment under HRS § 291E-36(a)(2)-(5)) and 
(2) other evidence or information (such as a listing of any 
prior alcohol and drug enforcement contacts under HRS § 291E-
36(a)(8), (b)(4)).  
 
 HRS §§ 291E-36, 291E-37, and 291E-38 all address the same 
subject matter: the review process for administrative driver’s 
license revocation.  So we interpret “other person” in both HRS 
§§ 291E-38(g) and 291E-37(c)(3) harmoniously.  See HRS § 1-16 
(“Laws in pari materia, or upon the same subject matter, shall 
be construed with reference to each other.  What is clear in one 
statute may be called in aid to explain what is doubtful in 
another.”).     
We conclude that “other person” in HRS § 291E-37(c)(3), 
like the identical term in HRS § 291E-38(g), refers only to the individuals mentioned in HRS § 291E-36.  The sworn statement 
requirement under these statutes does not cover civilian 
witnesses’ statements.  
 Sylvester maintains that if the legislature intended to 
allow consideration of unsworn civilian witness statements 
submitted by the government, it would have said so in HRS 
§ 291E-37(c)(3), just like it did in HRS § 291E-37(c)(1).  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
13 
 Subsection (c)(1) involves statements submitted by the driver.  
It requires an administrative review officer to consider any 
“sworn or unsworn written statement or other written evidence 
provided by the respondent.”  HRS § 291E-37(c)(1) (emphases 
added).  We do not view the absence of language concerning 
unsworn statements in HRS § 291E-37(c)(3) as a deliberate choice 
to bar unsworn civilian witness statements submitted by the 
government.  Rather, the provision reflects the legislature’s attention to specific evidence central to revocation 
determinations.  “[T]he Legislature chose to require the 
submission of sworn statements by key police and government 
officers as a means of ensuring the reliability of the 
revocation process.”  McGrail, 130 Hawaiʻ i at 80, 305 P.3d at 496 
(emphasis added).   
Further, the administrative driver’s license revocation 
framework does not limit the evidence the hearing officer 
may 
consider to only the evidence identified by HRS §§ 291E-36, 
291E-37, and 291E-38.  See Desmond v. Admin. Dir. of the Courts, 
91 Hawaiʻ i 212, 220, 982 P.2d 346, 354 (App. 1998) (rejecting the 
driver’s argument that a hearing officer could not admit 
“anything that is not specified by the statute”), rev’d on other *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
14 
 grounds, 90 
Hawaiʻi 301, 978 P.2d 739 (1998).14   
The evidence must be relevant and not prejudicial.  Freitas 
v. Admin. Dir. of the Courts, 108 Hawaiʻ i 31, 45–46, 116 P.3d 
673, 687–88 (2005).  But Sylvester doesn’t claim that the 
civilian witnesses’ statements were irrelevant or prejudicial.     
 Finally, Sylvester’s concern about the reliability of the civilian witnesses’ statements is overblown.  The HPD-252 forms contained a declaration from each witness attesting to the 
statement’s truth.  The HPD-252 statements and the witnesses’ 
statements referenced in the sworn police statements provided 
“reasonably trustworthy information” to support a probable cause 
determination.  State v. Maganis, 109 Hawaiʻ i 84, 86, 123 P.3d 
679, 681 (2005).  
Because HRS §§ 291E-36, 291E-37(c)(3), and 291E-38(g) do 
not require sworn civilian witness statements, we hold that a 
hearing officer can consider civilian statements – sworn or 
unsworn - in the probable cause determination.  The hearing 
officer who conducted Sylvester’s administrative hearing did not err in considering statements from the Nissan’s occupants. 
                                                 
14  Based on its review of HRS §§ 291E-36, 291E- 37, and 291E- 38’s 
predecessor statutes, the ICA held that the hearing officer did not 
reversibly err in admitting the entire case file into evidence.  Desmond, 91 
Hawaiʻi at 220- 21, 982 P.2d at 354 -55.  It opined that though the hearing 
officer erroneously admitted unsworn statements of a police officer who did 
not appear to testify, the error was harmless.  Id. at 220, 982 P.2d at 354.  
Desmond did not involve civilian witnesses.

15  In addition to raising the statutory interpretation issue, Sylvester 
claims that the district court failed to schedule his judicial review hearing 
“as quickly as practicable.”  This argument lacks merit.  We agree with the 
ICA’s conclusion that the 25-day delay (resulting from an extension of the 
time to file the record on appeal and a two- week continuance) did not violate 
Sylvester’s due process rights.
