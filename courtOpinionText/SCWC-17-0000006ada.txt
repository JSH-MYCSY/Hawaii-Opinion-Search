(continued . . .)  her empl oyer’s WC insurance carrier, Respondent/Intervenor -
Appellee DTRIC Insurance Company, Ltd. (“DTRIC”) shortly 
thereafter.   In 2014, Moranz brought suit in the Circuit Court 
of the Fifth Circuit (“circuit court”)  against Harbor Mall,  LLC, 
(“Harbor Mall”) the owner of the building in which she was 
injured, and in  2016, reached a settlement with Harbor Mall for 
$200,000.00 (“Harbor Mall settlement”).  Around the time of the 
Harbor Mall settlement, DTRIC sought reimbursement of those WC 
benefits it had paid to Mo ranz after her accident under Hawaiʻi 
Revised Statutes (“HRS”)  § 386-8 (2015)1 and Alvarado v. Kiewit 
Pacific, Co ., 92 Hawaiʻi 515, 520, 993 P.2d 549, 554 (2000) .2   
                     
1  HRS § 386-8 provides in relevant part:  
 
(d) No release or settlement of any claim or action under  
this section is valid without the written consent of both  
employer and employee.   The entire amount of the settlement 
after deductions for attor ney’s fees and costs as provided 
in this section is subject to the employer’s right of 
reimbursement for the employer’s compensation payments 
under this chapter and the employer’s expenses and costs of 
action. 
 
. . . . 
 
(f)  If the action is prosecuted by the employee alone, the 
employee shall be  entitled to apply out of the amount of 
the judgment for damages, or  settlement in case the action 
is compromised before judgment, the reasonable  litigation 
expenses incurred in preparation and prosecution of the 
action, together with a reasonable attorney ’s fee, which 
shall be based solely upon the services rendered by the 
employee's attorney in effecting recovery both for the 
benefit of the employee and the employer.   After the 
payment of the expenses and attorney ’s fee, there shall be 
applied out of the amount of the judgment or settlement 
proceeds, the amount of the employer ’s expenditure for 
compensation, less the employer ’s share of the expenses and 
attorney's fee.   On application of the employer, the court

(continued . . .)  Under HRS § 386-8 and Alvarado , when an injured 
employee recovers a third -party settlement , an insurer3 is 
                     
(. . . continued) 
 
shall allow as a first lien against the amount of the 
judgment for damages or settlement proceeds, the amount of 
the employer ’s expenditure for compensation, less the 
employer ’s share of the expenses and attorney ’s fee. 
 
HRS § 386-8.  Under chapter 386, “[t]he insurer of an employer is subject to 
the employer ’s liabilities [.]”  HRS § 386 -1 (2015).  However, the insurer is 
also “entitled to rights and remedies under [chapter 386]  as far as 
applicable .”  Id.  DTRIC is the WC insurance carrier for Moranz’s employe r.    
Thus, DTRIC is entitled to the “rights and remedies” afforded to Moranz’s 
employer under chapter 386 in the course of Moranz’s  WC action  and 
settlement . 
 
2  The formula established by the supreme court in Alvarado  is as 
follows:  
 
[U]nder HRS § 386 –8, the starting point to determine an 
employer ’s “share” is to be calculated as (1) the fraction 
equal to the amount of workers ’ compensation expended, plus 
calculable future benefits, divided by the total amount of 
the settlement.  This fraction will then b e (2) multiplied 
by the total amount of reasonable attorney ’s fees and costs 
incurred by the employee in the course of pursuing the 
recovery action. This “share” (computed in steps 1 and 2) 
should then be (3) subtracted from the total compensation 
already expended to date, by the employer.   This results in 
a first lien that the employer may assert against the 
settlement amount. However, prior to the execution of the 
lien, the remainder of the attorney ’s fees and costs should 
be (4) deducted from the settlem ent corpus.  Then, (5) the 
amount of the employer ’s first lien (already calculated as 
compensation expended minus share of the attorney ’s fees 
and costs) may be asserted against the settlement.  If a 
portion of the settlement corpus remains after the 
employer’s execution of the lien (6), the employee is 
entitled to that remainder, subject to the requirement that 
the employee first exhaust all necessary future workers ’ 
compensation payments from that remainder prior to 
requesting future compensatory payments  from the employer 
or its insurance carrier for the compensable injuries 
arising out of the same incident.  
 
Alvarado , 92 Hawaiʻi at 518–19, 993 P.2d 552–53. 
 
3  DTRIC is referred to as the “employer” in the lower court 
proceedings.  Although DTRIC is “ subject to the employer ’s liabilities ” and  
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
4 entitled to reimbursement of all WC benefits it has paid the 
employee, less its “share” of reasonable attorney’s fees and 
costs incurred by the employee in pursuing the third -party 
action.  Per HRS § 386-8 and Alvarado , we now clarify (1) the 
proper timing of  Alvarado  calculations , which determines  the 
reimbursement due the insurer from the third -party settlement  
and (2) the reimbursement process for an insurer when the amount 
of WC benefits the insurer  has already dispensed to the employee 
(“paid compensation”) is less than the amount it owes the 
employee for its “share” of attorney’s costs and fees  for the 
third-party action .  Here, the parties disagreed over whether 
certain WC benefits that DTRIC owed Moranz (“DTRIC settlement”) 
were proper ly classified as “paid compensation” or benefits that 
DTRIC owed Moranz in the future ( “calculable future benefits” ) 
under the Alvarado  formula.  The parties also disagreed over the 
process of DTRIC’s reimbursement of WC benefits because DTRIC’s  
“share” of attorney’s fees and costs exceeded the amount it had 
previously contributed to Moranz as “paid compensation .” 
We now clarify that Alvarado  calculations  shall be 
performed based on the date on which the  employee receives the  
                     
(. . . continued) 
 
“entitled to rights and remedies ” of the employer under chapter 386, DTRIC is 
not Moranz’s employer and, thus, will be referred to as the “insurer” in this 
opinion.  HRS § 386 -1; see supra note 1.  
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
5 third-party recovery .  In this case, at the time  Moranz received 
the third-party recovery  (i.e., the Harbor Mall settlement ) on 
or about September 20, 2016, DTRIC had not yet paid its 
settlement ; thus, the DTRIC settlement should have been 
categorized as a “calculable future benefit” ra ther than “paid 
compensation” under the Alvarado  formula.   
We also emphasize that an insurer’s “share” of the 
attorney’s fees and costs  the employee incurs while pursuing 
third-party recovery  is based on the insurer’s total WC 
liability .  Thus, we now cla rify that the insurer must pay its 
full pro rata “share” regardless of  the amount the insurer has 
contributed in “paid compensation” versus the amount it still 
owes in “calculable future benefits” at the time the  employee 
receives the  third-party recovery.   In this case, DTRIC owes its 
full “share” of Moranz’s attorney’s fees and costs in the amount 
of $89,140.17, based on its total WC liability of $189,062.13  
($63,245.41 in “paid compensation” plus $125,816.72 in “future 
calculable benefits” ).  Under HRS §  386-8(d), DTRIC is entitled 
to reimbursement of the $63,245.41 it has expended in “paid 
compensation.”  Further, under HRS § 386 -8(i), DTRIC is 
“relieved from the obligation to make further compensation 
payments to [Moranz]  . . . up to the entire amount o f the 
balance of the settlement or the judgment,” meaning that Moranz 
must exhaust $125,816.72 in “calculable future benefits” from  
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
6 the remainder of the Harbor Mall settlement.   After paying her 
attorney’s fees and costs  ($94,298.29 ), reimbursing DTRIC its  
“paid compensation”  ($63,245.41 ), and exhausting “calculable 
future benefits”  ($125,816.72 ) from the $200,000.00 Harbor Mall 
settlement, Moranz retains the remainder:  $5,779.75 in excess 
of her WC benefits.  
I. BACKGROUND  
A. Factual Background  & Circuit Court P roceedings  
Moranz was injured while working on August 28, 2012 
after she fell in a stairw ay near her place of employment in 
Lihue, Kauaʻi.  Moranz filed a claim for WC benefits, and 
received “ WC medical, indemnity[,] and vocational rehabilitation 
benefits”  from DTRIC pursuant to chapter 386 of the HRS.       
1. Harbor Mall Lawsuit and Settlement  
On August 25, 2014, Moranz filed a civil lawsuit 
against Harbor Mall, alleging negligen ce in maintaining the 
stairway.  Before trial was set to begin in July 2016, Moranz 
and Harbor Mall reached a settlement agreement , in which  Harbor 
Mall agreed to pay $200,000. 00 in general damages  and maintained 
its denial of liability.  A check for the $200,000.00 settlement 
was transmitted  from Harbor Mall to Moranz on September 16 , 
2016.  On September 22, 2016, the circuit court granted a Motion  
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
7 to Intervene  filed by DTRIC .4  On September 28, 2016, with the 
consent of all parties, Harbor Mall was dismissed from the 
lawsuit.     
2. DTRIC’s WC Lien 
  On May 24, 2016 , Moranz filed a “Mot ion for 
Determination of Validity of Claim of Lien  of DTRIC ” and argued 
that DTRIC was not entitled to reimbursement under HRS §  386-8 
for the WC benefits it had previously paid Moranz because:  
(1) DTRIC could not prove “duplication” within the settlement  of 
the WC benefits  it had paid, (2) DTRIC was entitled only to 
reimbursement of special damages for “medical and rehabilitative 
expenses and lost income” and the settlement was for “general 
damages only,”  and (3) considering  equitable principles,  Moranz 
would not be “made whole by receiving only a portion” of the 
settlement.  Moranz also alleged that DTRIC had failed to 
provide her with WC  documentation , which “ necessitated ” bringing 
the lawsui t against Harbor Mall , and that DTRIC continued to 
refuse to co operate and provide her with necessary  WC 
documentation .     
  DTRIC maintained that it was entitled to reimbursement 
of WC benefits it had paid Moranz , initially claiming a lien in 
                     
4  The Honorable Randal G.B. Valenciano presided.   
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
8 the amount of $66,177.35 .5  DTRIC asserted that, under HRS §  386-
8 and Alvarado, it was entitled to the entire amount of its lien 
less “reasonable attorney fees and its proportional share of 
cost of litigation.”  DTRIC contended that HRS §  386-8 and case 
law did not support Moranz’s argument that only special or 
duplicated damag es were eligible for reimbursement.  DTRIC 
                     
5  DTRIC claimed in its Memorandum in Opposition it paid $63,518.41 
in WC benefits ($30,747.48 in medical benefits, $20,276.43 in indemnity 
benefits, and $12,494.50 in vocational rehabilitation ben efits) to Moranz.   
However, based on a declaration from DTRIC Claims Examiner Aurelia C. 
Gamponia, it appeared DTRIC had paid only $63,245.41 in benefits ($30,474.48 
in medical benefits, $20,276.43 in indemnity benefits, and $12,494.50 in 
vocational rehabi litation benefits).  This discrepancy appears to stem from a 
clerical error in a figure Gamponia used in her declaration:  $30, 474.48 in 
medical benefits as opposed to the correct $30, 747.48 figure.  The error 
discussed above does not explain the $2 ,658.94 difference between the WC 
benefits paid and the total lien amount claimed by DTRIC in its Opposition.  
In a later filing, DTRIC changed its requested lien figure to 
$63,518.41, which represents the amount of WC benefits  DTRIC claimed it had 
paid Moranz.   
DTRIC filed a separate memorandum under seal containing its 
Alvarado  calculations.  In its memorandum, DTRIC  categorized $125,816.72 in 
permanent partial disability benefits as “calculable future benefits,” which 
led to a negative lien figure in step 3, as its share exceeded its WC 
expenditures.  However, DTRIC represented its figure for “paid compensation ” 
as the appropriate lien figure in step 5.  DTRIC also noted it would be 
entitled to exhaust $125,816.72 in future benefits against Moranz’s remaining 
recovery:   
 
(1) $63,518.41 [paid comp.] + $125,816.72 [future benefits] 
$200,000.00 [Harbor Mall settlement] = 95%  
 
(2) 95% x $93,000.00 [costs and fees] = $88,350.00  
[DTRIC’s share]  
 
(3) $63,518.41 [paid comp.] - $88,350.00  
[share] = -$23,831.55 [lien]  
 
(4) $200,000.00 [Harbor Mall settlement] - $4650.00  
[remainder of costs and fees] = $195,350.00  
 
(5) $195,350.00 - $63,518.41 [lien]  = $131,831.59  
 
(6) $131,831.59 - $125,816.72 [future benefits] =  
$6014.87 [remainder]   
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
9 argued that it was also entitled to a credit on future benefits, 
that is, relief from the obligation to make further compensation 
payments, up to Moran z’s net recovery from the Harbor Mall 
settlement.    
At oral argument on  the Motion , Moranz asked the 
circuit court to resolve three issues:  (1) the amount, if any, 
of the Harbor Mall settlement that should be eligible  for 
reimbursement to DTRIC; (2) the amount of DTRIC’s lien; and 
(3) DTRIC’s entitlement to a credit  against future benefits.  
Moranz emphasized that this court  regarded the Alvarado  formula 
as a “starting point” for reimbursement, and argued that the 
circuit court’s discretion was not limited to determining an 
insurer’s “share” of attorney’s fees and co sts.  Moranz also 
asked the circuit court to apply the “make -whole” doctrine, 
which would prioritize the Moranz’s right to recovery over 
DTRIC’s right to reimbursement.  DTRIC argued that Moranz sought 
to “avoid the lien issue” by claiming DTRIC could not recover 
from a settlement designated as “general damages only.”  DTRIC 
emphasized that HRS §  386-8 limited the circuit court ’s power to 
setting reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.  DTRIC objected to 
the reliance on equitable remedies  such as the “make -whole” 
doctrine where, as here, there was a n established method (i.e., 
the Alvarado  formula) to determine its lien and “ share” of costs 
and fees .  DTRIC also represented to the circuit court  that a WC  
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
10 settlement of $125,816.726 (“DTRIC settlement”) based on 
permanent partial disability liability was currently pending 
approval by the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations 
(“DLIR”) .   
The circuit court noted that a ruling that settlement s 
designated “general damages only”  cut off an insurer’s right to 
reimbursement  would create “a tidal wave of general damages 
claims to avoid these liens [.]”  The circuit court upheld 
DTRIC’s right to reimbursement from the Harbor Mall  settlement , 
and found that while DTRIC had generally consented to the 
settlement, it had not agreed to reducing  its lien.7  Thus, the 
circuit court held that DTRIC was “entitled to assert  its lien.”  
The circuit court clarified that the “only reduction” needed was 
for “reasonable litigation expenses and the amount of attorney’s 
fees,” pursuant  to HRS §  386-8 and Alvarado .  The circuit court 
                     
6  DTRIC and Moranz signed a Stipul ation and Settlement Agreement 
and Order on September 1, 2016, which included: $19,671.43 for temporary 
total disability, $605.00 for lost wages, $125,316.72 for permanent partial 
disability, and $500.00 for disfigurement.  To avoid confusion, see infra 
note 12, for the purposes of this opinion, “DTRIC settlement” refers to the 
$125,316.72 for permanent partial disability plus the $500.00 for 
disfigurement, for a total amount of $125,816.72.  
 
7  DTRIC communicated its consent to  the Harbor Mall settlement in a 
letter sent to Moranz on March 12, 2016, and filed its formal consent to the 
settlement on September 12, 2016.  In its March 12 letter to Moranz, DTRIC 
stated that it would consent to a settlement with Harbor Mall “ provided  the 
settlement is $200,000.00 or more [,]” but noted that “the issues regarding 
the lien repayment to DTRIC and applicability of the [future] credit 
[available to DTRIC] have yet to be determined.”    
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
11 directed the parties to calculate the appropriate deductions in 
accordance with Alvarado .   
3. DTRIC Settlement8 
On September 1, 2016, DTRIC and Moranz signed a 
Stipulation and Settlement Agreement and Order fo r the DTRIC 
settlement.  The $125,816.72 DTRIC settlement  was transmitted to 
the DLIR for approval on September 12, 2016, and approved on 
September 28, 2016.  Following this approval, on October 18, 
2016, DTRIC “made payment” of $19,732.89 to Moranz , which 
reflected :  a settlement in the amount of  $125,316.72,9 minus 
$5,927.13 of attorney’s fees and costs and a $99,656.70 
“subrogation credit” for its lien .     
4. Disputes Over Alvarado  Calculations  
There was lengthy correspondence between the parties 
to resolv e the form of the circuit court’s order and to 
determine the correct Alvarado  calculations .   
                     
8  Due to what appears to be a mistake on DTRIC’s part, the DTRIC 
settlement was not pending approval at the time of the August 23 hearing, as 
DTRIC had represented to the circuit court.  The DTRIC settlement was 
transmitted to the Director of the DLIR for approval on September 12, 2016.  
 
9  Although the correc t amount of the DTRIC settlement is 
$125,816.72, DTRIC based its October 18, 2016 payment to Moranz on  an amount 
of $125,316.72.   See supra note 6; infra note 12.  
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
12 On September 15, 2016, Moranz submitted a proposed 
order and  Alvarado  calculations  to the circuit court .10  Moranz 
used the below numbers in her calculations:  
DTRIC’s paid compensation:11   $63,245.41  
 (WC benefits paid to Moranz ) 
 
DTRIC’s calculable future benefits:  $125,816.72  
 (DTRIC settlement ) 
 
DTRIC’s share of fees and costs:   $89,140.17  
 
Based on the above calculations, Moranz concluded that because 
DTRIC’s “share” of fees and costs ($89,140.17) exceeded its 
“paid compensation ” ($63,245.41) , DTRIC was due no reimbursement 
from the $200,000.00 Harbor Mall settlement.  Moranz contended 
that if she received the Harbor Mall settlement before the DTRIC 
settlement , DTRIC would not be entitled to  a lien.  However, 
                     
10  On September 27, 2016, Moranz su bmitted a proposed order to the 
circuit court that was identical to her September 15 submission except that 
the caption had been updated to reflect that DTRIC had been accepted as a 
plaintiff -intervenor.   
 
11  “Paid compensation” refers to both “amount of [WC] expended” and 
“total compensation already expended to date.”  Alvarado , 92 Hawaiʻi at 518–
19, 993 P.2d 552 –53.  Our example in Alvarado  confirms these terms are 
synonymous:  
 
Assume a settlement in the amount of $200,000, attorney’s 
fees and costs tota ling $60,000, [WC] expenditures to date 
equaling $100,000 , and it is agreed that the injured 
employee will require $25,000 in future [WC] benefit 
payments.  The fraction would be (1) $100,000 plus $25,000 
divided by $200,000 or .625.  This fraction should then be 
(2) multiplied by $60,000, or $37,500.  This share should 
then be (3) subtracted from the $100,000 compensation paid , 
resulting in a lien of $62,500.   
Id. at 520, 993 P.2d at 554 (emphasis added).     
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
13 Moranz conceded that if DTRIC paid the DTRIC settlement  before 
she received the Harbor Mall settlement , DTRIC would have a lien 
in the amount of $99,921.96 .   
On September 19, 2016, DTRIC submitted a propose d 
order and Alvarado  calculations.   DTRIC included two versions of 
Alvarado  calculations:  one in which the DTRIC settlement was 
treated as “paid compensation ” and one in which it was treated 
as a “calculable future benefit. ”  Like Moranz, DTRIC concluded 
that if it paid Moranz the DTRIC settlement  before she received 
the Harbor Mall settlement --i.e., if the DTRIC settlement was  
categorized as  “paid compensation ”--DTRIC would have a 
$99,656.70 lien.12  DTRIC also conceded that if  Moranz received 
the Harbor M all settlement before it paid the DTRIC settlement --
i.e., if the DTRIC settlement was categorized  as a “calculable 
future benefit ”--Moranz would be entitled to the entirety of the 
Harbor Mall settlement, provided that DTRIC would be entitled to 
a $99,656.7 0 credit against the DTRIC settlement .   
                     
12  The circuit court sought clarification from t he parties as to why 
their Alvarado  calculations resulted in different lien amounts:  $99,921.96 
(Moranz) versus $99,656.70 (DTRIC).  The discrepancy was due to different 
figures used to calculate future benefits:  Moranz used an amount of 
$125,816.72, whi le DTRIC used $125,316.72.  The discrepancy was explained by 
a $500.00 disfigurement payment, which Moranz had factored into future 
benefits, but which DTRIC had not.  DTRIC admitted its mistake and confirmed 
that it believed $99,921.96 to be the correct lien amount.    
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
14 On October 27, 2016 , DTRIC filed a proposed order  
reflecting an updated  lien amount of $99,921.96.13  Moranz 
objected  to DTRIC’s October 27 proposed order, a rguing that 
because “the Alvarado  formula is applied at the  time of the 
third party settlement[,]” there was no basis to include the 
DTRIC settlement  as “paid compensation ” because it was still 
pending at the time the Harbor Mall settlement was paid .14  
Moranz proposed the below Alvarado  calculations:  
Step 1: The f raction equal to the amount of workers’  
compensation expended ($63,245.41), plus calculable future  
benefits ($125,816.72), divided by the total amount of the  
settlement ($200,000) equals 94.53%  ($63,245.41 + 
$125,816.72 = $189,062.13 / $200,000  = 94.53%). 
 
Step 2: The fraction , 94.53%,  is then multiplied by the 
total amount  of attorney ’s fees and costs incurred by  
the employee  in the course of pursuing the recovery action, 
$94,298.29, to determine DTRIC's “share” of Plaintiff’s 
attorneys[sic] fees and costs .  Thus, DTRIC’s “share of the 
fees/costs is $89,140.17  (94.53% x $94,298.29  
attorneys[sic] fees and costs = $89,140.17 ). 
 
Step 3: This “share” (computed in steps 1 and 2) is then 
subtracted from the total  compensation already expended to 
date, by the  employer, in order to determine  the first lien 
that the employer may assert against the settlement.  The 
Paid Compensation ($63,245.41) less DTRIC’s share of the 
fees and costs ($89,140.17) equals $ -25,894.76 ($89,140.17 
- $63,245.41 = $ -25,894.76), a negativ e number.  
 
 Because DTRIC’s share of the fees and costs 
($89,140.17) exceeds the amount of compensation benefits 
paid to date ($63,245.41), there is no reimbursement due 
out of the third party settlement [.] . .  
 
Step 4: Prior to the execution of the lien,  the 
remainder of the attorney ’s fees and costs should be  
                     
13  See supra note 12.  
  
14  As stated above, DTRIC “made payment” on the DTRIC settlement to 
Moranz on October 18, 2016, about a month after Moranz received payment on 
the Harbor Mall settlement on  or about  September 20, 2016.  
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
15 deducted from the settlement corpus .  The remainder of the 
attorney’s fees and costs to be deducted is $5,158.12 
($94,298.29 attorneys[sic] fees and costs - $89,140.17 
DTRIC’s share of the fees and costs = $5,158.12). The 
settlement corpus is the full $200,000.   The net settlement 
is therefore $105,701.71 ($200,000 - $94,298.29 = 
$105,701.71).  . . 
 
Step 5: Then, the amount of the employer’s first lien  
(already calculated as compensation expended minu s share of 
the attorney’s fees and costs), $ -25,894.76 (a negative 
number), would be asserted against the settlement .  
However, a negative  number indicates there is no lien due 
out of the settlement proceeds.  
 
On December 5, 2016, the circuit court entered  an 
order (“December 5 Order”) denying Moranz’s Motion for 
Determination of Validity of Claim of Lien  of DTRIC, and finding 
that DTRIC was entitled to a lien in the amount of $99,921.96  
against the Harbor Mall settlement .15  The circuit court entered 
its Judgment on December 27 , 2016.  The circuit court’s December 
5 Order did not include any Alvarado  calculations.  
B. Appellate  Proceedings   
1. ICA Appeal 
On appeal to the Intermediate Court of Appeals 
(“ICA”), Moranz presented three points of error, claiming the 
circuit court erred when it:  (1) declined to consider common 
law and equitable principles to limit DTRIC’s subrogation and 
reimbursement rights; (2) awarded a lien based on unpaid 
                     
15  The circuit court did not include in its Order a copy of the 
Alvarado  calculations it used.  It appears the court used the latest 
calculations and order proposed by DTRIC, which calculated a lien  of 
$99,921.96 :  $63,245.41 [past WC benefits] + $125,816.72  [DTRIC settlement] = 
$189,062.13  [total paid compensation] - $89,140.17  [DTRIC’s share of 
attorney’s fees and costs] = $99,921.96  [first lien].   
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
16 benefits; and (3) relied on unpaid future compensation when 
calculating the li en reduction for attorney’s fees and costs.  
The ICA affirm ed the circuit court’s December 5  Order and 
December 27  Judgment.  First, the ICA held that the circuit 
court correctly  interpreted HRS §  386-8 and found that the 
statute’ s “plain and unambiguous t erms do not provide or allow 
for the [application of ] equitable considerations[ .]”  Next, the 
ICA concluded that the circuit court did not err in calculating 
the amount of DTRIC’s lien.   The ICA reasoned that because 
Moranz had “executed a stipulated [WC] settlement” before the 
circuit court entered its December 5 O rder, the circuit court 
did not err in including the $125,816.72 DTRIC settlement  as 
“paid compensation”  in calculating DTRIC’s lien .  The ICA 
calculated the same lien amount --$99,921.96 --as the circuit 
court and included  the following  Alvarado  calculations :16 
Step 1: The fraction equal to the amount of workers ’
compensation expended, plus calculable future  
benefits, divided by the total amount of the  
settlement equals .9453 ($189,062.13 ÷ $200,000).  
 
Step 2: The fraction is multiplied by the total amount  
of reasonable attorney ’s fees and costs incurred by  
                     
16  Like DTRIC and the circuit court, the ICA used t he $189,062.13 
figure for DTRIC’s paid compensation, comprised  of: 
 
 $30,474.48 medical expenses  
$20,276.43 indemnity payments  
 $12,494.50 vocational rehab  
 $125,316.72 DLIR Settlement (permanent partial disability)  
 $500.000 disfigurement  
 ——————————————— ———————————————————————————————————————————  
 $189,062.13 Paid Compensation   
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
17 Moranz in the recovery action, which results in  
DTRIC's “ share” of $89,140.17 (.9453 x $94,298.29).  
 
Step 3: This “share” is subtracted from the total 
compensation already expended to date, by the  
employer, which is the first lien in the amount of
$99,921.96  ($189,062.13- $89,140.17) that DTRIC may
assert against the settlement amount.   
 
 
Step 4: Prior to the execution of the lien, the  
remainder of the attorney’ s fees and costs should be  
deducted from the settlement corpus, resulting in  
$194,841.88  ($200,000- $5,158.12) . 
 
Step 5: The amount of the employer ’s first lien may be  
asserted against the settlement, $194,841.88 - 
$99,921.96.  
 
Step 6: If a portion of the settlement corpus remains
after the employer ’s execution of the lien, the  
employee is entitled to that remainder, which is  
$94,919.92 .  
 
2. Application for Writ of Certiorari  
  Moranz filed a timely Application for Writ of 
Certiorari with this court on March 18 , 2021.  In her 
application, Moranz presents two questions:  (1)  whether the ICA 
gravely erred in interpreting HRS §  386-8 without considering 
equitable  subrogation principles when determining the insurer’s 
right of reimbursement ; and (2 ) whether the ICA gravely erred in 
interpreting HRS §  386-8 “to allow an insurer to claim  
unexpended future benefits in its right of reimbursement .”  
Moranz’s Application was granted.

18 P.3d 1170, 1177 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).   This 
court’s construction of statutes is guided by the following:  
First, the fundamental starting point for st atutory 
interpretation is the language of the statute itself.  
Second, where the statutory language is plain and 
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain 
and obvious meaning.  Third, implicit in the task of 
statutory construction is our fo remost obligation to 
ascertain and give effect to the intention of the 
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the 
language contained in the statute itself.  Fourth, when 
there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness 
or uncertaint y of an expression used in a statute, an 
ambiguity exists.

Appeals of Honolulu , 114 Hawaiʻi 184, 193 –94, 159 P.3d 143, 152 –

of the ambiguous words may be sought by examining the context, 
with which the ambiguous words, phrases, and sentences may be 
compared, in order to ascertain their true meaning.”  Id.  A 
court may also resort to extrinsic aids in determining

IV.  DISCUSSION  
A. The ICA Did Not Err by Declining  to Consider Equitable  
Subrogation Principles When Determining DTRIC’s Right of 
Reimbursement Under HRS §  386-8 
Moranz argues that common la w equitable subrogation 
principles should apply to limit  DTRIC’s right of reimbursement 
under HRS §  386-8.  The ICA rejected this argument, finding that 
HRS § 386-8’s “plain and unambiguous terms do not provide or  
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
19 allow for” the application of equitable pr inciples.  The ICA is 
correct:  the language of HRS §  386-8 is plain and unambiguous, 
such that it would be  inappropriate to use equitable principles 
in its interpretation.  
When interpreting a statute , “the fundamental  starting 
point . . . is the language of the statute itself ” and “where 
the statutory language is plain and unambiguous, [this court’s]  
sole duty is to give effect to its plain and obvious meaning .”  
Wheeler, 121 Hawaiʻi at 390, 219 P.3d at 1177 (quoting  Citizens 
Against Reckless Dev. , 114 Hawaiʻi at 193–94, 159 P.3d at 152–
53).  Thus, we turn to the language of HRS §  386-8, which 
provides that when an injured employee reaches a settlement with 
a third party, the employee’s WC insurer is entitled to 
reimbursement out of that settlement:  
(f)  If the action is prosecuted by the employee alone, the 
employee shall be entitled to apply out of the amount of 
the judgment for damages, or settlement in case the action 
is compromised before judgment, the reasonable litigation 
expenses incurred in preparat ion and prosecution of the 
action, together with a reasonable attorney’s fee, which 
shall be based solely upon the services rendered by the 
employee's attorney in effecting recovery both for the 
benefit of the employee and the [insurer] .  After the 
payment of the expenses and attorney’s fee, there shall be 
applied out of the amount of the judgment or settlement 
proceeds, the amount of the [insurer] ’s expenditure for 
compensation, less the [insurer] ’s share  of the expenses 
and attorney's fee .  On application  of the [insurer] , the 
court shall allow as a first lien against the amount of the 
judgment for damages or settlement proceeds, the amount of 
the [insurer] ’s expenditure for compensation, less the 
[insurer] ’s share of the expenses and attorney's fee.  
HRS § 386-8(f) (emphasis added) .  The statute requires such 
settlements to be approved in writing by both the employee and  
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
20 the insurer in order to be valid, and clarifies that “ [t]he 
entire amount of the settlement  after deductions for attorney’s 
fees and costs  as provided in this section is subject to the 
[insurer] ’s right of reimbursement for the [insurer] ’s 
compensation payments  under this chapter and the [insurer] ’s 
expenses and costs of action. ”  HRS §  386-8(d) (emphasis added).  
The language of HRS §  386-8 is plain and unambiguous:  
an insurer is entitled to the “amount of the [insurer] ’s 
expenditure for compensation ” less its “share” of costs and 
fees, deducted from the “entire amount of the settlement.”  HRS 
§ 386-8(d), (f).  HRS § 386-8(f) states plainly that the insurer 
is entitled to reimbursement of its “expenditure for 
compensation”; there is no additional language limiting 
reimbursement to “special damages” or those benefits the insurer 
can prove are “duplicated” by the settlement.  HRS §  386-8(d) 
also states plainly that the “ entire amount of the 
settlement  . . . is subject to the [insurer]’s right of 
reimbursement .”  (emphasis added).   The statute’s use of the 
word “entire” is logically opposed to any argument that DTRIC is 
entitled only to reimburse ment from a portion of the settlement.   
Had the legislature intended to limit an insurer’s reimbursement 
to a portion of the employee’s third -party settlement, it could 
have done so  by expressly limiting reimbursement in HRS §  386-8 
to duplicated benefits or special damages , or to only a portion  
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
21 of the employee’s recovery .17  The legislature did no such thing.  
The language of HRS §  386-8 unambiguously indicates that an 
insurer is entitled to reimbursement from the entire settlement 
amount, and we decline to  use equitable principles to alter this 
interpretation.  
Likewise, nothing in  Alvarado  constitutes  an 
endorsement of using equitable principles to adjust the amount 
of an insurer’s reimbursement or an employee’s recovery under  
HRS § 386-8, beyond adjusting  the insurer’s “share” of costs and 
fees.  While we stated in Alvarado  that the formula is a 
“starting point[]  in determining an employer’s share of 
reasonable attorney’s fees and costs [,]” we also explained that 
“the circuit court retains the discretion t o consider each case 
on its merits” if the court finds that the insurer’s “share” is 
“not reasonable in light of the particular circumstances of a 
                     
17  See, e.g., HRS § 392-46 (stating that “the insurer  . . . 
providing disability benefits shall be subrogated to, and have a lien upon, 
the rights of the individual against the thir d party to the extent that the 
damages include wage loss during the period of disability for which temporary 
disability benefits were received in the amount of such benefits ” (emphasis 
added)); HRS §  431:10C-307 (“Whenever any person effects a tort liabili ty 
recovery for accidental harm, whether by suit or settlement, which duplicates 
personal injury protection benefits already paid  under the provisions of this 
article, the motor vehicle insurer shall be reimbursed fifty per cent of the 
personal injury prot ection benefits  paid to or on behalf of the person 
receiving the duplicate benefits up to the maximum limit.”  (emphasis added) ); 
HRS § 663-10(a) (“The judgment entered  . . . shall include a statement of the 
amounts, if any, due and owing to [a valid lienho lder] and to be paid to the 
lienholder out of the amount of the corresponding  special damages recovered 
by the judgment or settlement .” (emphasis added) ); HRS §  346-37 (“The lien 
shall be satisfied from that portion  of the settlement, award, or judgment 
allocated or allocable to payments by the department for medical assistance 
and burial payments .” (emphasis added) ).    
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
22 case[.]”  92 Hawaiʻi at 520, 993 P.2d at 554  (emphasis added) .  
For example , if an insurer “does not cooperate and/or hinders an 
employee’s attempt to pursue recovery ,” id., the circuit court 
might order the insurer to pay a larger “share” because the 
insurer’s bad faith actions directly increase d costs and fees  
and it would be unfair to force the employee to shoulder these 
higher costs and fees proportionally .  However, discretion 
extends only to a court’s ability to “determin[e] an [insurer] ’s 
share of reasonable attorney’ s fees and costs .”  Id.  Our 
emphasis in Alvarado  on exacting a “share” from the insurer that 
reflects reasonable  costs and fees  parallels  the language of HRS 
§ 386-8, which entitles an employee  
to apply out of the amount of the judgment  . . . or 
settlemen t . . . the reasonable  litigation expenses 
incurred in preparation and prosecution of the action, 
together with a reasonable  attorney’s fee, which shall be 
based solely upon the services rendered by the employee’s 
attorney in effecting recovery both for th e benefit of the 
employee and the [insurer] .   
HRS § 386-8(f) (emphasis added) .  Thus, while the circuit court 
retains discretion to adjust what “share” of costs and fees it 
deems reasonable to impose on an insurer, there is no basis in 
the language of HRS  § 386-8 to conclude  that the circuit court 
also has discretion to  (1) decrease the reimbursement due an 
insurer or (2) increase the remainder of the settlement 
ultimately awarded to an  injured employee  who the court  feels is 
not “made whole” by her recove ry.    
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
23 In the present case, the circuit court could have 
determined that DTRIC’s “share” of attorney’s fees and costs of 
$89,140.17 , calculated under the Alvarado  formula, was not 
reasonable, especially given Moranz’s allegations that DTRIC 
failed to cooper ate in and hindered her attempt to pursue 
recovery from Harbor Mall.  The circuit court could have 
increased DTRIC’s “share” of attorney’s fees and costs , thereby 
increasing Moranz’s recovery.  However, the circuit court did 
not make this determination and  chose not to adjust DTRIC’s 
“share.”  The ICA was correct in rejecting Moranz’s argument 
that equitable or common law subrogation principles  apply to HRS 
§ 386-8. 
B. The ICA Erred by Including the DTRIC Settlement  as Paid 
Compensation  Under the Alvarado  Formula 
Moranz argues that the $125,816.72 DTRIC settlement  
should have been treated as a “calculable future benefit” rather 
than “paid compensation ” in DTRIC’s lien  calculation  because she 
received the DTRIC settlement payment after she received the 
Harbor Ma ll settlement  payment.  The ICA rejected this argument, 
finding that the DTRIC settlement was properly regarded as “paid 
compensation ” at the time of the circuit court’s December 5 
Order, resulting in a  lien calculation  of $99,921.96 .  The ICA 
was incorrec t; the DTRIC settlement should have been included as 
a “calculable future benefit” under the Alvarado  formula.  
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
24   The issue here, then, is:  at what point in time is an 
item previously categorized as a “calculable future benefit” 
properly regarded as  “paid co mpensation” ?  The resolution of 
this issue turns on when the Alvarado  calculation  is performed .  
Under Moranz’s approach, the key date (i.e., the date on which 
Alvarado  calculation s should occur) is the day on which the 
third-party recovery  is received by the employee; any WC 
benefits or settlement paid after receipt of the third -party 
recovery  is not “paid compensation,” but rather, a “calculable 
future benefit” under the Alvarado  formula.  Under the approach  
used by the ICA , the key date is the day on whi ch the circuit 
court enters its order; any WC benefits or settlement paid 
before the circuit court’s order is “paid compensation,” and 
anything paid after the circuit court’s order is a “calculable 
future benefit.”  Under the  ICA approach, the date on whic h the 
third-party recovery  is received by the employee  is irrelevant.  
In the present case , Harbor Mall transmitted its 
settlement check on September 16, 2016 and Moranz received the 
payment on or about September 20 , 2016.  DTRIC did not transmit 
its settle ment check  until October 18 , 2016, though Moranz and 
DTRIC had previously signed a “Stipulation and Settlement 
Agreement and Order” for the DTRIC settlement on September 1 , 
2016.  
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
25 The most sensible  date on which to perform Alvarado  
calculations is the dat e on which the employee receives the 
third-party recovery .  As we stated in Alvarado , “this court is 
bound to construe statutes so as to avoid absurd results .”  92 
Hawaiʻi at 517, 993 P.2d at 551.  Therefore, a statutory 
interpretation that is  “rational, s ensible[,] and 
practicable  . . . is preferred to one which is unreasonable[,] 
impracticable  . . . inconsisten[t], contradict[ory], and 
illogical[ ].”  Id. (quoting Keliipuleole v. Wilson , 85 Hawaiʻi 
217, 221 –22, 941 P.2d 300, 304 –05 (1997)).   It is practic able to 
direct circuit courts to categorize benefits based on the date 
of the third -party recovery :  any WC benefits  paid before the 
employee receives the third -party recovery  is “paid 
compensation,” any  WC benefits  paid after is a “calculable 
future benef it.”   
This approach is consistent with HRS § 386-8, titled 
“Liability of third person,”  as the language therein focuses on 
the pursuit of third -party recovery .  The legislative history of 
HRS § 386-8 recognizes that a third -party action can result in 
“recovery from a third person which benefits both the employee 
and the [insurer ,]” even when the action is prosecuted by the 
insurer or employee alone.  H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 375, in 
1973 House Journal, at 912 (emphasis added) ; see also S. Stand. 
Comm. Rep.  No. 864, in 1973 Senate Journal, at 974 (stating  
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
26 similar) .  Thus, HRS §  386-8’s provisions ensure that an 
employee and insurer share proportionally :  (1) liability for 
the costs and fees associated in bringing the third -party action 
and (2) recovery from any judgment or settlement .  Given this 
focus on the third -party action, the relevant timeline is the 
duration of such third-party action, and the date on which the 
insurer’s Alvarado  “share” (i.e., its liability for costs and 
fees) should be calculated is the date on which the third -party 
action is brought to an end , by way of either judgment or 
settlement . 
This approach is also consistent with our opinion in 
Alvarado , which uses an illustrative example to clarify that an 
employer’s “share” is subtracted f rom “compensation paid,” and 
not from “compensation paid” plus “future [WC] benefit 
payments.”  Alvarado  at 520, 993 P.2d at 554.   
Because Moranz received the Harbor Mall settlement on 
or about September 20, 2016 , before DTRIC paid the DTRIC 
settlement for future WC benefits on October 18 , 2016, the DTRIC 
settlement  is properly regarded  as a “future calculable benefit ” 
under the Alvarado  formula.   Defining  the DTRIC settlement as 
“future benefits” rather than  “paid compensation” results in  
DTRIC’s “share” of costs and fees exceeding its “paid 
compensation .”  Thus, DTRIC is not, as the ICA held, entitled to 
a lien in the amount of $99,921. 96; Moranz is correct that DTRIC  
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
27 is not entitled to any lien .  However, where an employee obtains 
a third-party settlemen t, under HRS § 386 -8, DTRIC is entitled 
to reimbursement out of the settlement for its “paid 
compensation” and is relieved from further compensation payments 
up to the balance of the settlement after deduction of fees and 
costs.18  HRS § 386 -8(d), (i).  
Given that the parties agree that DTRIC has paid 
$63,245.41  in past WC benefits, t he proper Alvarado  calculations 
are as follows:  
Step 1:  Calculate t he fraction equal to “paid 
compensation ” ($63,245.41 , past WC benefits ) plus 
“calculable future benefits ” ($125,816.72 , DTRIC 
settlement ), divided by the total amount of the  
Harbor Mall settlement ($200,000 .00) 
 
$63,245.41 + $125,816.72 = $189,062.13 / 
$200,000 .00 = 0.9453 
 
Step 2:  The fraction  (0.9453) is then multiplied 
by the attorney’s fees and costs incurred  by 
Moranz in pursuing the action  against Harbor Mall  
($94,298.29) to determine DTRIC's “share”  of the 
attorney’s fees and costs  
 
0.9453 x $94,298.29 = $89,140.17  
 
Step 3:  This “share” ($89,140.17) is then 
subtracted from “paid compensation ” ($63,245.41) 
                     
18  See HRS § 386 -8(d) (“The entire amount of the settlement after 
deductions for attorney ’s fees and costs  . . . is subject to the [insurer ]’s 
right of reimbursement for the [insurer] ’s compensation payments  . . .”); id. 
§ 386-8(i) (“After reimbursement for the [insurer] ’s compensation  payments, 
the [insurer]  shall be relieved from the obligation to  make further 
compensation payments to the e mployee under this  chapter up to the entire 
amount of the balance of the  settlement or the judgment, if satisfied, as the 
case may be,  after deducting the cost and expenses, including attorneys ’ 
fees.”).  
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
28 to determine the first lien that DTRIC may assert 
against the Harbor Mall settlement  
 
$63,245.41 - $89,140.17  = -$25,894.76  
 
Step 3, above, shows that DTRIC’s “share” of attorney’s fees and 
costs ($89,140.17) exceeds its “paid compensation” ($63,245.41) 
by $25,894.76.  Because Step 3 of the Alvarado  formula yields a 
negative number due to DTRIC’s “share” exceeding its “paid 
compensation,” DTRIC has no lien , but must still contribute its 
full pro rata “share” of attorney’s fees and costs .  DTRIC owes 
its full “share,” regardless of the amount it has contributed in 
“paid compensation” versus “calculable future benefits” in 
recognition of the fact that “the [employee’s] attorney guarded 
[DTRIC]’s interests  . . . when [DTRIC]’s attorney had not been 
active in l itigation.”  Alvarado  at 519, 993 P.2d at 553 ; see 
also Takahashi v. Loomis Armored Car Serv. , 625 F.2d 314, 316 
(9th Cir. 1980)  (“[T]he assessment against the employer for its 
pro rata share of the attorney ’s fee in the third party tort 
recovery [is] . . . measured by his total compensation liability 
under the act, however much the obligation may remain 
unfulfilled at the time of the third party recovery, rather than 
the compensation payments then actually made to the work [er].”) 
(quoting Teller v. Major S ales, Inc. , 313 A.2d 205, 207 (N.J. 
1974)).  Thus, DTRIC owes its full original “share” of Moranz’s 
attorney’s fees and costs :  
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
29 Step 3a:  DTRIC owes its full original “share” 
($89,140.17)  toward Moranz’s attorney’s fees and 
costs ($94,298.29 ) 
$94,298.29  (full amount of Moranz’s attorney ’s 
fees and costs)  - $89,140.17  (DTRIC’s “share” of 
attorney ’s fees and costs ) = $5,158.12  (Moranz’s 
“share” of attorney ’s fees and costs ) 
Moranz owes her “share” of attorney’s fees and costs, taken out 
of the Harbor Mall sett lement: 
Step 4a:  Moranz’s “share”  of attorney ’s fees and 
costs ($5,158.12) is deducted  from the 
$200,000 .00 Harbor Mall settlement  
$200,000.00 - $5,158.12 = $194,841.88  
However, under HRS § 386 -8(d), DTRIC is still entitled to 
reimbursement of its “paid c ompensation”:   
Step 5a:  DTRIC is entitled to reimbursement of 
its “paid compensation” ($63,245.41)  
$194,841.88  (remainder of Harbor Mall settlement 
after deduction of Moranz’s “share”  of attorney ’s 
fees and costs ) - $63,245.41 (DTRIC’s “paid 
compensatio n”)= $131,596.47  
Further, u nder HRS § 386 -8(i) and Alvarado , 92 Hawaiʻi at 520 
nn.4–5, 993 P.2d at 554 nn.4 –5, Moranz must draw “future 
benefits, ” including the $125,816.72  DTRIC settlement, from her 
$131,596.47  recovery .  DTRIC, in turn, is “ relieved fro m the 
obligation to  make further compensation payments to the 
employee  . . . up to the entire amount of the balance of the  
settlement or the judgment [.]”  HRS § 386 -8(i).  Moranz is then  
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
30 entitled to the $5,779.75  remainder of the $200,000 .00 Harbor 
Mall settlement:  
Step 6:  Moranz must  collect “calculable future 
benefits”  (e.g., the $125,816.72  DTRIC 
settlement ) from the remainder of the Harbor Mall 
settlement  
$131,596.47  (remainder of Harbor Mall settlement)  
- $125,816.72  (DTRIC settlement)  = $5,779.75 net 
recovery  to Moranz from the $200,000 .00 Harbor 
Mall settlement    
Under these calculations, DTRIC pays approximately 95% of 
attorney ’s fees and costs ( $89,140.17  “share” of $94,298.29 ), 
and, therefore, has a gross recovery of  approximately 95% of the 
Harbor Mall settlement , not taking into account its obligation 
regarding attorney’s fees and costs :  DTRIC recovers a  
$63,245.41 reimbursement for its  “paid compensation ” and is 
relieved from paying $125,816.72 in “calculable future benefits ” 
($189,062.13  of $200,000.00 settlement ).  Likewise, Moranz pays 
approximately 5% of attorney’s fees and costs ($5,158.12  “share” 
of $94,298.29 ) and her gross recovery is approximately 5% of the 
settlement  ($10,937.87  of $200,000.00 settlement ), not taking 
into account her o bligation regarding attorney’s fees and costs .   
This outcome is also consistent with the general 
principle that the employee should not receive double recovery , 
that is, both WC benefits and a third party settlement .  See 
First Ins. Co. v. A&B Properties , 126 Hawaiʻi 406, 418, 271 P.3d 
1165, 1177 (2012) (“Under [HRS § 386-8’s] framework, and  
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
31 consistent with the general notion of avoiding double recovery 
for an employee, the employer recovers any money that it 
advanced as compensation, with the excess going  to the 
employee .”); 82 Am. Jur. 2d Workers’ Compensation  § 13 (2021) 
(“A substantial part of the legislative purpose and intent of a 
[WC] statute is to provide for subrogation and prevent double 
recovery. ”).  Here, it cannot be said that Moranz receives  
unfair double recovery because she recover s only $5,779.75  (paid 
by Harbor Mall ) in excess of her WC benefits  (paid by  DTRIC).  
Indeed, the above calculations --wherein DTRIC recoups its total 
WC liability  of $189,062.13,  Harbor Mall pays $200,000.00 in 
damages, and Moranz receives a net recovery of $5,779.75 --is 
fair to all of the parties to the Harbor Mall action:  DTRIC, 
“the [insurer] , who, in a fault sense, is neutral , comes out 
even;” Harbor Mall, “the third [party,] pays exactly the damages 
[it] would ordinarily pay[;]”  and Moranz, “the employee[,] gets 
a fuller reimbursement for actual damages sustained than is 
possible under the compensation system alone.”   1 Lex K. Larson, 
Larson’s Workers’ Compensation  Law § 110.02 (Matthew Bender, 
Rev. Ed. 2021) . 
The above method of computation most clearly reflects 
the language of HRS §  386-8 where an insurer’s “share” of 
attorney’s fees and costs exceeds the amount of its “paid 
compensation.”
