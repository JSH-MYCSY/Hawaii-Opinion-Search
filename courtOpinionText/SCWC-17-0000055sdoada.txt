 2 Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence in favor of 
Respondent/Plaintiff- Appellee the State of Hawaiʻi (“State”).  
 Previously, in 2000, Y oung was convicted and sentenced for 
1999 charges of Sex Assault in the Second Degree and Sex Assault 
in the Third Degree of his ex-girlfriend.  Young was initially 
sentenced to five years of probation with one year of 
confinement, and he was also ordered to complete  a sex offender 
treatment program .  Based on his conviction on sex assault 
offenses, Young was also required to register as a sex offender, 
which comes with various reporting requirements under Hawai ʻi 
Revised Statutes ( “HRS”) Chapter 846E (2014).  In 2001, Young’ s 
probation was revoked due to non-compliance with sex offender 
treatment p rogram requirements, a nd he was re -sentenced to ten 
years’ confinement.   Young was paroled  in 2007.  His sentence 
for the sex assault convictions expired on November 5, 2010.     
 After expiration of this sentence, Young was notified of 
continued reporting requirements based on his sex assault 
convictions.   He failed to report in person as re quired by law 
within the thirty-day period following his date of birth in both 
2014 and 2015.  Additionally, Young’s lack of a home address 
triggered a requirement that he report quarterly,  and he failed 
to report from October 2014 to January 2016.     
 After a March 30, 2016 traffic stop, Young was charged with 
two counts of Failure to Comply with Covered Offender ***  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 3 Registration Requirements in violation of HRS §§ 846E -9(a)(2) & 
(c) (2014), and HRS §§ 846E- 9(a)(12) & (c) (2014).  On July 21, 
2016, Young pled no contest and t he circuit court adjudicated 
him guilty on both counts.   The circuit court ordered a pre-
sentence investigation and report (“PSI”) .    
 Young told the probation officer preparing the PSI he had 
completed the sex offender treatment program while in custody, a 
statement he also repeated at the December 1, 2016 sentencing.
  
The probation officer who prepared the PSI indicated Young’s 
claim that he completed the treatment program “was not verified 
as Hawaii Paroling Authority records were unavailable for 
review.”
 
 The Deputy Attorney General representing the State 
requested that if the circuit court was inclined to grant 
probation, it also order Youn g to complete sex offender 
treatment.  Young’s defense counsel requested credit for time 
served and four years of Hawai ‘i’s Opportunity Probation with 
Enforcement (
“HOPE probation ”) for both counts.  No 
determination was made before sentencing as to whether Young had 
previously completed sex offender treatment
. 
 The circuit court sentenced Young to a four year term of 
HOPE probation with special conditions, including one year of 
imprisonment with credit for time already served.  The circuit 
court also ordered, as another special condition of Young’s ***  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 4 probation, that he “participate satisfactorily in the Hawai [‘]i 
sex offender treatment program as approved by [ his] probation 
officer. . . .”  
 Young filed a notice of appeal on February 2, 2017, raising 
two points on appeal: (1) the circuit court’s adjudication of 
Young’s guilt under HRS § 846E -9 violated Young’s right to equal 
protection, and (2) the circuit court abused its discretion in 
sentencing Young to probation with special conditions of one 
year incarceration and the completion of sex offender treatment, 
because Young was not convicted of a new sex crime but of 
failing to report for previous sex crimes.
 
 The ICA affirmed the circuit court’s judgment and sentence 
on May 31, 2018.  State v. Young, CAAP- 17-0000055 at 7 (App. May 
31, 2018) (SDO).  First, the ICA held that “Young waived his 
constitutional challenge to his conviction when he entered his 
no-contest plea.”  Young, SDO at 4.  Second, the ICA held that 
the circuit court’s sentence of one year of incarceration as a 
special condition of his probation was in accord with the 
guidelines set forth in State v. Sumera, 97 Hawaiʻi 430, 39 P.3d 
557 (2002) , and was not an abuse of discretion.  Young, SDO at 
6.  The ICA also stated:  
Here, although  Young
 was not convicted of a new sex 
offense, the Circuit Court had information before it 
indicating that  Young had a history of improper sexual 
behavior, including prior convictions for sexual assault in 
the second degree and sexual assault in the third 
degree. F urthermore, it appears that  Young never completed ***  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 5 the sex offender treatment stemming from his previous 
sexual assault convictions. Therefore, we conclude that the 
Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in 
ordering Young to undergo sex offender treatment. 
 
Young, SDO at 7. 
  
 In his certiorari application , Young again raises two 
points.  First, he argues the ICA erred in affirming the circuit 
court’s judgment of guilt, because his conviction under HRS 
Chapter 846E violates his right to equal protection.  Second, he 
argues the ICA gravely erred in failing to hold the circuit 
court abused its discretion in sentencing him.  We address these 
points as follows. 
 With respect to Young’s first point  on certiorari, the ICA 
erred in ruling that Young’s assertion of non -jurisdictional 
claims was barred by his no contest plea.  See  State v. 
Hernandez, 143 Hawai ʻi 501, 509, 431 P.3d 1274, 1282 (2018).  On 
the merits, however, Young’s constitutional equal protection 
claims were addressed and rejected by this court in State v. 
Guidry, 105 
Hawaiʻi 222, 238- 41, 96 P.3d 242, 258- 61 (2004).   
 With respect to Young’s second point on certiorari, a  
sentencing court has broad discretion in imposing a sentence.  
State v. Solomon, 107 Hawai ʻi 117, 126, 111 P.3d 12, 21 (2005).  
The imposition of sex offender treatment requires a factual 
basis in the record indicating that such a condition is 
reasonably related to the factors set forth in HRS § 706-606 and 
is reasonably necessary for the purposes indicated in HRS § 706 -***  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 6 606(2).  State v. Kahawai, 103 Hawaiʻ i 462, 466- 67, 83 P.3d 725, 
729-30 (2004).   With respect to the special condition of 
participation in the sex offender treatment program, th e ICA’s 
affirmance was based, in part, on its unsubstantiated 
understanding that Young did not previously complete the 
program, as ordered.  Young twice stated he had completed the 
program while in custody and the probation officer who prepar ed 
the PSI was unable to verify or refute this information.    2
                         
2    Pursuant to HRS § 806 -73(b) (2014), all adult probation records, 
including PSIs, and “the contents of the records”  are confidential, to be 
divulged to specified individuals or entities only as set forth therein.   In 
State v. Hussein, 122 Hawai ʻi 495, 299 P.3d 313 (2010 ), we held  that HRS § 
806-73 incorporates the PSI uses permitted by HRS § 706 -604(2) and therefore 
permits the divulgement of information contained in the PSI for sentencing  
purposes.  Hussein, 122 Hawai ʻi at 524, 527, 299 P .3d at 342, 345.  As stated 
in Hussein, “[O]ur courts have sanctioned the use of information contained in 
the [pre- sentence report] in open court in determining the proper sentence to 
be imposed[.]”  Hussein, 122 Hawaiʻ i at 525, 299 P.3d at 343.  We have 
indicated that PSIs “should not [be] employed  for purposes not contemplated 
by HRS § 806- 73.”  State v. Greyson, 70 Haw. 227, 234, 768 P.2d 759, 763 
(1989) (vacating conviction for State’s improper use of PSI to impeach 
defendant during trial).   
 We note that State v. Heggland
, 118 Hawai ʻi 425, 443, 193 P.3d 341, 359 
(2008) merely confirmed two other pieces of publicly available information  
with regard to defendant’s prior Colorado conviction; thus, no confidential 
information was revealed.  In addition, as noted in Hussein, 122 Hawai ʻi at 
525
-26, 229 P.3d at 343 -44, the PSI information quoted by the ICA in State v. 
Chavira, No. 29082, 2009 WL 458772 (App. Feb. 25, 2009)(SDO) was “Chavira’s 
Sentencing Statement, . . . [which] was made a part of the [PSI] upon his 
request[.]”  The Sentencing Statement ha d been filed as a public document on 
December 13, 2006, before it was incorporated into the PSI, 
see State v. 
Chavira, Criminal No. 04 -1-269 in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit, 
and the ICA therefore did not quote any confidential information.  Thus, 
Heggland and Chavira  do not authorize divulgement of confidential information 
in a PSI other than as authorized by HRS § 806 -73.  See Hussein, 122 Hawai ʻi 
at 525
-26, 229 P.3d at 343 -44.   
 The Dissent cites to the  following passage from Hussein:  “What HRS 
§§ 
806-73(b) and 706- 605 prohibit is not such use  of the report, but public 
disclosure and access to the [pre -sentence report] itself .” Hussein, 122 
Hawaiʻi at 529, 229 P.3d at 347 (emphasis added).  This quotation refers to 
and allows “such use .”  The phrase “such use” refers back to the “ use” 
discussed in the previous sentence, 
which is that “the statutes presume tha t 
a defendant’s personal information may be disclosed on the record and in open 
(continued. . .)  ***  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 7  We therefore vacate the ICA’s September 11, 2018 Judgment 
on Appeal and the circuit court’s December 1, 2016 Judgment of 
Conviction and Probation Sentence,  and remand this matter to the 
circuit court for resentencing.  The circuit court shall address 
whether Young previously completed the sex offender treatment 
program while in custody and, if deemed relevant, the effect 
this fact has on Young’s sentence for failing to comply with sex 
offender reporting requirements.

court at sentencing hearings to the extent the parties and the court find it 
necessary to refer to it.”  Id.  Thus, Hussein  only allows divulgement of PSI 
information as necessary for sentencing.  And although we disagree with the 
Dissent as to whether additional information from the PSI discussed by the 
Dissent is material to the sentencing issue we discuss, we agree with the 
Dissent that a ppellate court s are not prohibited from referring  to 
information in a PSI not referenced during the sentencing proceeding when it 
is relevant to a sentencing  issue discussed on appeal.
