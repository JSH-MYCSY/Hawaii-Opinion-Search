OPINION OF THE COURT BY POLLACK, J.

 have determined that not allowing the appeal to proceed would 
result in the deprivation of the defendant’s due process rights . 
  Defendants in criminal cases also have a statutory 
right to seek review of an Intermediate Court of Appeals’ (ICA) 
judgment on appeal by filing an application for writ of 
certiorari to this court.  The effect of counsel’s failure to 
timely file a certiorari application is no different than 
counsel’s failure to timely file a notice of appeal --the 
defendant has forfeited a statutory right and been deprived of 
the effective assistance of counsel.  Upon review of applicable 
precedent, we hold that certiorari review is a critical stage of 
the criminal proceedings during which a defendant has the 
constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel, which 
includes counsel’s procedural compliance with the steps required 
to timely file an application for a writ of certiorari.   
  In this case the application for writ of certiorari 
was untimely filed due to an error of defense counsel  or as a 
result of a computer system error.  R egardless of the source of 
the error, defense counsel failed to ensure the timely filing of 
the certiorari application, which counsel has acknowledged.  As 
a result,  the defendant was deprived of the constitutional right 
to the effective assistance of counsel on di scretionary review.  
Under these circumstances, we may consider the merits of the 
issues raised in  the certiorari application,  and we elect to do ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 so here.  Based upon our review  of the certiorari application , 
we affirm the ICA’s judgment  on appeal .  
I. BACKGROUND  AND TRIAL 
  On May 31, 2016, 
the State of Hawaiʻi charged Jason K. 
Uchima by complaint in the District Court of the First Circuit 
(district court) with operating a vehicle under the i nfluence of 
an intoxicant (OVUII) in violation of HRS § 291E -61(a)(1)1 and/or 
(a)(3).2  Uchima pleaded not guilty to the charge.    
  Prior to trial, Uchima filed a motion to suppress 
evidence seized or information obtained by the Honolulu Police 
Department (HPD) after he  was arrested, including all statements 
made by him to law enforcement.  Uchima argued that he was in 
custody when he was instructed by HPD Officer Richard Townsend 
to exit his vehicle and asked to participate in a field sobriety 
test (FST) as he “was clearly not free to leave ,” and that he 
                     
 1 HRS § 291E -61(a)(1) (Supp. 2015) provides as follows:  
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle 
under the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates 
or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:  
 (1) While under the influence of alcohol in an amount 
sufficient to impair the person’s normal mental 
faculties or ability to care for the person and guard 
against casualty[.]   
 2 HRS § 291E -61(a)(3) (Supp. 2015) provides as follows: “A person 
commits the offense of operating a vehicle under the influence of an 
intoxicant if the person operates or assumes actual physical control of a 
vehicle: . . . . With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two hundred ten liters 
of breath[.]”  The State’s motion to strike th is portion of the charge was 
granted prior to the commencement of trial.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 was subject to interrogation when Officer Townsend asked him 
“medical rule out”  questions3 because such questions are likely 
to elicit an incriminating response.  Uchima maintained that the 
police’s failure to provide him with Miranda warnings prior  to 
custodial interrogation violated his rights under the federal 
and state constitutions and required the suppression of his 
statements to law enforcement.  
 
  The parties stipulated to consolidate the evidentiary 
hearing on the motion to suppress with the trial of the OVUII 
charge.4  A bench trial was held on November 4, 2016, and January 
24, 2017.5  The State presented the testimony of one witness, 
Officer Townsend.  
  Officer Townsend
 testified that,  on May 14 , 2016, 
around 12:45 a.m., he stopped Uchima’s vehicle after he  observed 
it crossing over the broken white lines of the road for 
approximately 30 to 40 yards along Beretania Street before the 
Punchbowl intersection.  Officer Townsend stated that, when he 
                     
 3 Uchima contended that medical rule -out questions include the 
following: whether the person has any physical defects or speech impediments, 
whether the person is taking any medication, and whether the person is under 
the care of a physician, a dentist, or an optometrist.   
 
 4 We recently held in State v. Chang, 144 Hawaiʻ i 535, 556, 445 P.3d 
116, 137 (2019), that courts may not consolidate a motion to suppress hearing 
with trial.  However, Chang’s holding was prospective and does not affect the 
determination of issues before us.  See id.  
5 The Honorable James H. Ashford presided. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 pulled the vehicle over, Uchima was in the driver’s seat and  had 
the odor of alcohol, slurred speech, red and watery eyes, and 
his face was flushed.  The officer testified that he explained 
to Uchima why he had pulled him over and asked for Uchima’s 
driver’s license.  Officer Townsend  said that he had to ask 
Uchima questions “a couple of times” because he could not 
understand what Uchima was saying.    
  Based on his observations, Officer Townsend testified,  
he asked Uchima if he would participate in an FST, and Uchima 
consented.  According to the o fficer, Uchima appeared  unsteady 
on his feet as he exited his vehicle.  Officer Townsend stated 
that he explained the three tests consisting of the FST-- the 
horizontal gaze nystagmus test, the walk- and-turn test, and the 
one-leg stand test-- to Uchima before proceeding with the tests.   
Officer Townsend related that, during administration of the FST,  
Uchima stated that he understood the instructions to each of the 
tests. 
  Wit h regard to the horizontal gaze nystagmus test, 
Officer Townsend testified that Uchima was instructed to keep 
his head still and follow the o fficer’s pen only with his eyes 
but that Uchima could not keep his head still despite being 
repeatedly told do so.   As to the walk- and-turn test, Officer 
Townsend testified that  he instructed Uchima to take nine “heel-
to-toe” steps using an imaginary line, turn,  then return nine ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
6 
 heel-to-toe steps back,  and to count aloud the numbe r of steps 
he took.  According to Officer Townsend,  Uchima did not count 
out loud, took ten steps instead of nine on each pass, did not 
touch his heel  to his toe during his steps,  stepped off line on 
each step, had his hands raised,  paused once for several seconds 
to keep balance, and swayed as he walked.   On the one-leg stand 
test, Of ficer Townsend testified that Uchima’s performance 
deviated from the instructions: he had difficulty balancing 
while his right leg was raised, his arms were raised to about 
mid-torso rather than at his sides, and  he hopped on his planted 
foot during the last ten seconds of the test.    
  Officer Townsend stated that following the conclusion 
of the three tests he informed another officer of Uchima’s 
performance, and the second officer placed Uchima under arrest.   
  In response to defense counsel’s questions, Officer 
Townsend testified that he went over the medical rule-out 
questions with Uchima prior to conducting the FST .  Officer 
Townsend explained that he asked Uchima whether he was under the 
care of a doctor or dentist, whether he was taking any 
medication, whether he was diabetic or epileptic, and whether he 
had any physical disabilities.   Uchima responded in the negative 
to the questions, Officer Townsend testified.  
  After  the conclusion of the evidence, the district 
court ruled upon the motion to suppress.  The district court ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
7 
 determined that Uchima was not subjugated to the will of the 
examiner and that the situation only became “custodial” at the 
conclusion of the third test.  As to whether an interrogation 
occurred, the court concluded that the questions asked of Uchima 
when he was in the car were not likely to yield incriminating 
information and that the same was true with questions as to 
whether Uchima would like to exit the car,  whether he was 
willing to participate in an FST, and whether he understood the 
instructions provided during each of the three tests.  The court 
also determined that the answers to the medical rule- out 
questions “would have no probative  value, no inculpatory or 
exculpatory value. ”  The district court accordingly  denied 
Uchima’s motion to suppress.6 
  T he district court thereupon found Uchima guilty of 
the OVUII charge and sentenced him to community service, fine, 
and a one-year license revocation
.7  Uchima appealed from the 
district court’s January 24, 2017 Notice of Entry 
of Judgment 
and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, and its February 23, 2017 Notice 
of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment entered 
(collectively, Judgment)
.   
                     
 6 The district court incorporated its findings and conclusions from 
the motion to suppress into its findings with respect to the OVUII charge.  
 
7 The court imposed the community service and fine on January 24, 
2017, and the license revocation on February 23, 2017.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 II. UCHIMA’S APPEAL  
A. ICA Proceedings 
 
 On appeal to the ICA , Uchima contend ed that the 
district court erred in denying the motion to suppress, arguing 
that his right to remain silent under article I, section 10 of 
the Hawai
ʻi Constitution was violated because he was never 
advised of his Miranda rights and that his verbal statements and 
non-verbal communicative acts were the product of custodial 
interrogations.  (C iting State v. Tsujimura, 140 Hawai ʻi 299, 400 
P.3d 500 (2017).)  Uchima also argued that the officer ’s medical 
rule-out questions and questions as to whether he understood the 
instructions on the FST were likely to evoke an incriminating 
response regardless of how 
he answered, and  that his actual 
performance on the FST was a communicative response.   Uchima 
asserted that the district court’s error was not harmless beyond 
a reasonable doubt and that without the officer’s  erroneously 
admitted testimony, there was no t substantial evidence to 
support his conviction.  The State responded that the district 
court did not err and the Judgment should be affirmed. 
  In a summary d isposition order, the ICA  concluded that 
the admission of Uchima’s performance on the FST  did not violate 
his right against self-incrimination because performance on an  
FST is neither communication nor testimony.  And, the ICA held, 
Uchima’s right to remain silent was not violated when he ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
9 
 provided answers to the medical rule- out questions  because 
Tsujimura concerned whether pre -arrest silence  could be used as 
substantive evidence against the defendant and did not involve a 
defendant’s statements to police.   The ICA accordingly held that 
the district court did not err in admitting Officer Townsend’s 
observations of Uchima’s driving, Uchima’s answers to the 
medical rule-out questions, and Uchima’s performance on the FST.  
The ICA also concluded that there was substantial evidence to 
support Uchima’s conviction .  The ICA thus affirmed the 
Judgment. 
B. Uchima’s Application for Writ of Certiorari  
  The ICA  judgment on appeal was filed on March 19, 
2018.  On March 2 7, 2018, Uchima ’s motion for an extension of 
time to file an application for a writ of certiorari 
(Application) was granted,  and the deadline was extended to May 
18, 2018.  S ix days after the extended due date, Uchima filed 
his Application along with his counsel’s motion  to accept the 
untimely Application.  
 
 In the motion to accept, Uchima argues that this court 
should consider his A pplication on the merits despite its 
ostensible untimeliness because the  failure to file within the 
deadline resulted entirely from either c omputer system error or 
his counsel’s mistake.   In a declaration attached to the motion, 
counsel for Uchima avers that he “finished drafting the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
10 
 Application and believed that he properly efiled it ” on May 18, 
2018.  Counsel states that he would not have sought an extension 
of time to file the A pplication if he had not intended to file 
it.  Counsel adds that he “had no reason to suspect that there 
was any issue in creating Uchima’s case.”   
  
Upon receiving notice on May 24, 2018, that the State 
had filed a motion to execute Uchima’s sentence  in district 
court, counsel states that  he checked the Judiciary Electronic 
Filing and Service S ystem and was unable to locate a case for 
Uchima’s Application.8  Counsel explains  that he also “checked 
his emails” and discovered that he had never received an email 
confirming that a case for Uchima’s Application had been created 
on May 18, 2018.  Counsel indicates  that after seeking advice, 
he filed the motion to accept along with the A pplication.  
Counsel declares that he is unsure as to why the A pplication was 
not filed, surmising that it was due to user or computer system 
error on that particular occasion and that he  has filed numerous 
certiorari applications in the past using the same procedure 
without any issues.  The State did not file an opposition to the 
motion to accept or a response to Uchima’s Application.   
                     
 8 The Judiciary Electronic Filing and Service System allows for the 
electronic filing of court documents.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 III.  STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Jurisdiction 
  The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law and 
is reviewed de novo under the right/wrong standard.  Lingle v. 
Hawaii Gov’t Empls. Ass’n, AFSCME, Local 152 , 107 Hawai ʻi 178, 
182, 111 P.3d 587, 591 (2005).  
B. Motion to Suppress 
  We review a trial cour t’s ruling on a motion to 
suppress evidence de novo to determine whether the ruling was 
“right” or “wrong.”  State v. Estabillio
, 121 Hawai ʻi 261, 269, 
218 P.3d 749, 757 (2009);  State v. Jenkins, 93 Hawaiʻi 87, 100, 
997 P.2d 13, 26 (2000).    
C. Sufficiency of  the Evidence  
  The sufficiency of the evidence is reviewed on appeal 
by this court as follows: 
[E]vidence adduced in the trial court must be considered in 
the strongest light for the prosecution when the appellate 
court passes on the legal sufficiency of such evidence to 
support a conviction; the same standard applies whether the 
case was before a judge or jury.  The test on appeal is not 
whether guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt, but 
whether there was substantial evidence to support the 
conclusion of the trier of fact.  
State v. Richie, 88 Hawaiʻi 19, 33
, 960 P.2d 1227, 1241 (1998) 
(alteration in original) (quoting State v. Quitog, 85 Hawaiʻi 
128, 145, 938 P.2d 559, 576 (1997)).  “‘Substantial evidence’  as 
to every material element of the offense charged is credible 
evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
12 (continued . . .)  
 enable a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion .’”  
State v. Kalaola, 124 Hawaiʻi 43, 49, 237 P.3d 1109, 1115 (2010) 
(quoting Richie, 88 Hawaiʻi at 33, 960 P.2d at 1241).   
IV. DISCUSSION 
A. This Court Has Jurisdiction To Review the Late Filing of 
the Application  in This Case . 
  
HRS § 602- 59 grants a party the right to petition this 
court for discretionary review of an ICA judgment or dismissal 
order by submitting an application for writ of certiorari no 
later than thirty days after the filing of the ICA’s judgment or 
dismissal order.9  A party may extend the time for filing the 
                     
 9 HRS § 602 -59 (2016) provides in part the following:  
 
(a) After issuance of the intermediate appellate court’s 
judgment or dismissal order, a party may seek review of the 
intermediate appellate court’s decision and judgment or 
dismissal order only by application to the supreme court 
for a writ of certiorari,  the acceptance or rejection of 
which shall be discretionary upon the supreme court . 
 
(b) The application for writ of certiorari shall tersely 
state its grounds, which shall include:  
     (1) Grave errors of law or of fact; or  
     (2) Obvious inconsistencies in the decision of the 
 intermediate appellate court with that of the supreme 
 court, federal decisions, or its own decision,  
and the magnitude of those errors or inconsistencies 
dictating the need for further appeal.  
 
(c) An application for a writ of certiorari may be filed 
with the supreme court  no later than thirty days after the 
filing of the judgment or dismissal order of the 
intermediate appellate court.  Upon a written request filed 
prior to the expiration of the thirty -day period, a party 
may extend the time for filing an application for a writ of 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
13 
 certiorari application for an additional thirty days if the 
party files a written request prior to the expiration of the 
thirty-day period.  HRS § 602 -59(c). 
  In this case, Uchima requested an extension of time to 
file his Application.  However, Uchima’s counsel avers that 
either as a result of 
the judiciary’s computer system or user 
error, the Application was not filed until six days after the 
extended deadline of May 18, 2018.  These circumstances require 
us to determine whether we have jurisdiction to review the 
merits of Uchima’s Application.  
 The Hawai ʻi Revised Statutes Confer a R ight To Appeal and a 1.
Right To Petition This Court for Certiorari  Review. 
 
  In 
Hawaiʻi, every defendant in a criminal case who is  
aggrieved by a district or circuit court judgment is guaranteed 
a statutory right to appeal.  Briones v. State, 74 Haw. 442, 
460, 848 P.2d 966, 975 (1993) (citing HRS §§ 641- 11 (Supp. 1991)  
and 641-12 (1985 )).  Specifically,  pursuant to HRS § 641- 12(a),10 
                                                                               
(. . . continued) 
 
certiorari for no more than an additional thirty 
days. . . . 
 
 10 HRS § 641 -12(a) (2016) provides the following:  
Appeals upon the record shall be allowed from all final 
decisions and final judgments of district courts in all 
criminal matters.  Such appeals may be made to the 
intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 602,  
whenever the party appealing shall file notice of the 
party’s appeal within thirty days, or such other time as 
may be provided by the rules of the court.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
14 
 a defendant has a right to appeal from “all final decisions and 
final judgments of district courts in all criminal matters”  to 
the ICA, subject to c hapter 602.  Similarly, HRS § 641- 11 allow s 
appeals from circuit court judgments to the ICA  in criminal 
matters, subject to chapter 602.11  Included within chapter 602, 
HRS § 602-59(a) gives a party the right to seek review of the 
ICA’s judgment on appeal or dismissal order “by application to 
the supreme court for a writ of certiorari.”  While acceptance 
of an application for a writ of certiorari is discretionary with 
this court, HRS § 602-59(a) expressly provides defendants in 
criminal cases with a statutory right to seek review of the 
ICA’s judgment on appeal 
or dismissal order.   
 A Defendant in a Criminal Case Has the Constitutional Right to 2.
the Effective Assistance of Counsel During the Certiorari 
Stage of a Criminal Proceeding.  
  “Article I, section 14 of the Hawai ʻi Constitution 
guarantees a defendant in a criminal prosecution the right ‘to 
have the assistance of counsel for the accused’s defense.’” 
Maddox v. State, 141 Hawai ʻi 196, 202, 407 P.3d 152, 158 (2017) 
                     
 11 HRS § 641 -11 (2016) provides the following:  
Any party aggrieved by the judgment of a circuit court in a 
criminal matter may appeal to the intermediate appellate 
court, subject to chapter 602, in the manner and within the 
time provided by the rules of court.  The sentence of the 
court in a criminal case shall be the judgment.  All 
appeals shall be filed with the clerk of the supreme court 
and shall be subject to one filing fee.  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
15 
 (quoting Haw. Const. art. I, § 14).  This right is deemed so 
fundamental that it is specifically provided to indigent 
defendants in our state constitution.  Haw. Const. art. I, § 14 
(“The State shall provide counsel for an indigent defendant 
charged with an offense punishable by imprisonment .”).   
  We have emphasized that the “right to counsel is an 
essential component of a fair trial ” secured by article I, 
section 14 of the Hawaiʻi State Constitution.   State v. Pitts , 
131 Hawaiʻ i 537, 541, 319 P.3d 456, 460 (2014); see also State v. 
Tarumoto, 62 Haw. 298, 299, 614 P.2d 397, 398 (1980).   
Accordingly, the constitutional right to be represented by 
counsel is guaranteed 
to the accused at every critical stage of 
the prosecution.  Pitts , 131 Hawaiʻ i at 541, 319 P.3d at 460 
(citing Reponte v. State, 57 Haw. 354, 361, 556 P.2d 577, 582 
(1976)); Haw. Const. art I, § 14.  A “critical stage ” of a 
prosecution is “any stage where potential substantial prejudice 
to defendant’s rights inheres.”  Pitts, 131 Hawaiʻ i at 541-42, 
319 P.3d at 460-61 (internal quotations omitted) (quoting State 
v. Masaniai, 63 Haw. 354, 359, 628 P.2d 1018, 1022 (1981)).   
  We have held that critical stages  of a criminal 
proceeding include trial, post-verdict motions, sentencing, 
effectuating an appeal, and minimum term hearings conducted by 
the 
Hawaiʻi
 Paroling Authority (HPA).  Akau v. State, 144 Hawaiʻi 
159, 161, 439 P.3d 111, 113 (2019) (trial ); Pitts, 131 Hawaiʻi at ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
16 
 542-44, 319 P.3d at 461- 63 (post-verdict motions and 
sentencing); Maddox, 141 Hawai ʻi 
at 207, 407 P.3d at 163 
(effectuating an appeal) ; De La Garza v. State, 129 Hawaiʻi 429, 
439, 302 P.3d 697, 707 (2013) (minimum term hearings).  Our 
decisions have highlighted t he importance of counsel’s 
assistance at these stages of the criminal proceedings.  In 
State v. Akau, for example, we stated that “the right to couns el 
is ‘fundamental and essential to a fair trial.’ ”  144 Hawaiʻi at 
161, 439 P.3d at 113 (brackets omitted) (quoting Gideon v. 
Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 342-44 (1963)) .  In State v. Pitts,  we 
sua sponte raised the issue of a defendant’s right to counsel 
during post-verdict motions and held that the trial court erred 
by denying the defendant substitute counsel during this stage
 of 
the proceedings.  131  Hawaiʻi at 542, 319 P.3d at 46 1 (“In order 
to prevent similar future deprivations, we hold that the post-
trial motion stage is a critical stage of the prosecution during 
which the right to counsel attaches[.]”).  We have also 
recognized that c ounsel plays a pivotal role in ensuring a fair 
sentencing procedure by assisting a defendant in navigating  the 
intricacies of the criminal process and protecting a defendant’s 
substantial rights.  
State v. Phua, 135 Hawaiʻ i 504, 512, 353 
P.3d 1046, 1054 (2015) (stating that the assistance of counsel 
is of “paramount importance” during sentencing because it is an 
“oftentimes complicated part of the criminal process ” that ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
17 contains subtleties “beyond the appreciation of the average 
layperson”) .  
Counsel’s assistance is also essential in preserving 
arguments for appeal, preparing the defendant for any 
proceedings that may come after conviction, and taking whatever 
steps are necessary to protect the right to appeal .  Maddox, 141 
Hawai
ʻi at 204-07, 407 P.3d at 160- 63 (“It logically follows that  
the steps to effectuate an appeal constitute a critical stage in  
the proceeding during which a defendant is entitled to 
counsel.”).  Additionally, we have held that the assistance of 
counsel is crucial during post- conviction administrative

P.3d at 709 (“[A] convicted person is constitutionally entitled
to be represented at the hearing by counsel who can ensure that 
the minimum sentence imposed by the HPA is not predicated on

at 463 (observing the defendant would have benefited  by having

 . . . but a life term of imprisonment with the possibility of

The Hawai ʻi Supreme Court is the court of last resort 
in our state, and it is the ultimate interpreter of Hawaiʻi’s 
constitutional and statutory law.  State v. Santiago, 53 Haw. 
254, 265, 492 P.2d 657, 664 (1971) (“[T]his court is the  final 
arbiter of the meaning of the provisions of the Hawaii 
Constitution.”); 
AlohaCare v. Dep’t of Human Servs. , 127 Hawaiʻi 
76, 87, 276 P.3d 645, 656 (2012) (stating that the Hawaiʻi 
Supreme Court is the “final arbiter” of Hawaiʻi statutory law).  
In the vast majority of criminal appeals, certiorari review 
provides the last pathway to ensure that the defendant’s 
substantial rights were observed during the trial and sentencing 
phases of the proceedings.12  Cf. Briones, 74 Haw. at 465, 848 
P.2d at 977 (“The appellate court’s purpose is to ensure [a] 
defendant’s right to a fair trial .”).  And much like pretrial 
and trial proceedings, post -verdict motions, sentencing, and 
minimum term hearings, certiorari review is an “oftentimes 
complicated part of the criminal process” such that not 
providing a defendant the assistance of counsel would restrict 
the defendant’s ability to be meaningfully heard.  Phua, 135 
                     
 12 Court rules impose significant restrictions on post- conviction 
challenges.  See Hawaiʻi Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 40.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
19 Hawaiʻi at 512, 353 P.3d at 1054; s ee State v.  Mundon, 121 
Hawaiʻi 339, 367, 219 P.3d 1126, 1154 (2009) (“[T]he right to be 
heard would be, in many cases, of little avail if it did not 
comprehend the right to be heard by counsel[.]” ( second 
alteration in original) (quoting Geders v. United States, 425 
U.S. 80, 88-89 (1976))). 
Initiating the certiorari review process requires a 
defendant to be able to understand the legal bases for the ICA’s 
decision and have sufficient knowledge of legal principles and 
caselaw to challenge that decision .  See HRS § 602 -59(b) 
(requiring certiorari applications to state grave errors of law 
or fact, or obvious inconsistencies in the ICA’s decision with 
state or federal caselaw).  A defendant must also be aware of 
and comply with procedural requirements, including filing 
deadlines  and the prescribed contents of a certiorari 
application.  See HRS § 602-59(c) (concerning filing deadlines); 
Hawaiʻi Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 40.1 (2017) 
(specifying sections of a certiorari application).  This 
knowledge of law and procedure is almost uniformly beyond the 
ability of unrepresented defendants, and compliance with 
procedural requirements presents additional obstacle s to 
incarcerated defendants.  See D’Ambrosio , 112 Hawaiʻi at 465, 146
P.3d at 625 (“Moreover, the HPA Guidelines set forth rather
complex criteria . . . .”); cf. Briones, 74 Haw. at 465, 848  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
20  
(continued . . .)  
 P.2d at 977 (“[I]t  is counsel’s responsibility  [on appeal] , in 
the limited time and space allowed, to present issues that may 
have influenced the trial court’s  decision adversely to [their] 
client.”).  Thus, the assistance of counsel is a virtual  
necessity to effectively  petition  this court for certiorari  
review.13 
  We thus conclude that the right to seek certiorari 
review to this court is a critical stage of the criminal 
proceedings.  Unquestionably, providing the right to counsel 
during this stage of the proceeding s enhances the criminal 
justice process and provides greater assurance that the 
proceedings have comported with due process.14  See Mundon, 121 
                     
 13 As is evident from the many cases this court reviews in which a 
petitioner or respondent is represented by appointed counsel, counsel’s 
obligations do not terminate after the ICA  issues a judgment on appeal; 
certiorari review in this court may thus be considered a “stage[] of the 
proceedings” and part of the “appeal” for which counsel is appointed and 
receives compensation as provided by statute and rule.  See HRS § 802 -5 
(2014) (providing for reasonable compensation to appointed counsel for 
representation at all stages of the proceeding, including appeal); HRAP Rule 
2.1(b) (2010) (“‘[A]ppeal’ includes every proceeding in the Hawai ʻi appellate 
courts other than an original action[.]”); HRAP Rule 39 (d)(1) (2016) 
(“Requests for indigent fees and necessary expenses . . . shall be 
accompanied by a copy of the order appointing counsel” which is generally the 
order issued pursuant to HRS § 802- 5); see also  Kargus v. State, 169 P.3d 
307, 313 (Kan. 2007) (treating a petition for review to the state supreme 
court as a “level[] of the state appellate process” in a defendant’s direct 
appeal of a felony conviction); Am. Bar Ass’n,  Criminal Justice Standards for 
the Defense Function, Standard  4-9.2(h) (4th ed. 2017) (“ [A]ppellate counsel 
should ordinarily continue to represent the client through all stages of a 
direct appeal, including review in the United States Supreme Court.”).   It is 
not necessary, however, to resolve whether the certiorari process should be 
considered a step of the direct appeal.  
 14 Hawaiʻi’s statutory law provides an indigent defendant in a 
criminal case the statutory right to counsel on appeal, including proceedings ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
21 (continued . . .)  Hawaiʻi at 367-68, 219 P.3d at  1154-55 (denying the defendant the
right to confer with counsel during a routine 15-minute recess 
improperly restricted the defendant’s opportunity to be heard 
during the trial); Pitts , 131 Hawaiʻi at 544, 319 P.3d at 463 
(denial of right to counsel affects defendants ’ ability  to 
defend their “interests on a level playing field”).   We 
therefore hold that a defendant has a constitutional right to 
the assistance of counsel during proceedings on certiorari 
review.   Cf.  Akau, 144 Hawaiʻi at 161, 439 P.3d at 113; Pitts, 15 
(. . . continued) 
in this court.  HRS §  802-5(a) (“[T]he judge shall appoint counsel to 
represent the [indigent] person at all stages of the proceedings, including 
appeal, if any.” (emphasis added)).  Thus, HRS §  802-5 provides an indigent 
defendant in a criminal case with the right  to appointed counsel on 
certiorari review.  The record, however, appears to indicate that Uchima is 
represented by privately retained counsel.  Nevertheless, as the Chief 
Justice aptly observes, “i t would be fundamentally unfair to extend  the 
remedy of ineffective assistance of counsel only to the indigent ” and deny it 
to the non- indigent because they can afford counsel.  Recktenwald, C.J., 
Concurring and Dissenting at 3 n.2.  While we agree with this conclusion, the 
Chief Justice reasons therefrom that the constitutional question of the right 
to counsel should be avoided because “Uchima is entitled to identical relief 
whether his right to effective counsel stems from statute or the 
constitution.”  Id. at 5.  But it is the due process clause of article I, 
section 5 of the Hawai ʻi Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the 
United States Constitution that imposes the “standards necessary to ensure 
that judicial proceedings are fundamentally fair.”  Lassiter v. Dep’t of Soc. 
Servs. of Durham Cty., 452 U.S. 18, 24, 33 (1981) (due process “expresses the 
requirement of ‘fundamental fairness’”).  Thus, because the question of the 
right to counsel for non -indigent defendants in criminal cases is not merely 
a statutory question, the constitutional issue of the right to counsel on 
certiorari review cannot be avoided.  
15It would be illogical to conclude that the defendant’s right to 
counsel granted by the Hawai ʻi Constitution ends before the defendant’s 
opportunity to be heard before the highest court of this state, yet resumes 
during an administrative proceeding before the HPA, or that it protects a 
defendant’s rights during a routine 15 -minute recess to a greater extent than 
proceedings before the state court of last resort , whose duty it is to 
interpret and enforce the Hawai ʻi Constitution.  See Mundon, 121  Hawaiʻi at ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
22 131 Hawaiʻ i at 541- 42, 319 P.3d at 460- 61; Maddox, 141 Hawaiʻi at
207, 407 P.3d at 163 ; De La Garza, 129 Hawaiʻi at 439, 302 P.3d 
at 707.   
The right to assistance of counsel during certiorari 
review, however, “ cannot be satisfied by mere formal 
appointment.”  State v. Smith, 68 Haw. 304, 309, 712 P.2d 496, 
499 (1986) (quoting Avery v. Alabama, 308 U.S. 444, 446 (1940)).   
Rather, the c onstitution of the State of Hawai ʻi requires more 
than mere assistance.  It is well settled that the 
constitutional right to the assistance of counsel in a criminal 
case is satisfied only when such assistance is effective
.  
Maddox, 141 Hawaiʻ i at 203, 407 P.3d at 159; State v. Tetu, 139 
Hawai‘i 207, 215, 386 P.3d 844, 852 (2016);  Briones, 74 Haw. at 
460, 848 P.2d at 975.  Indeed, a primary reason that a defendant 
is guaranteed the effective assistance of counsel is to ensure 
that the defendant is not denied due process.   Maddox, 141 
Hawaiʻi at 206, 407 P.3d at 162 (citing Tetu, 139 Hawaiʻi at 219, 
386 P.3d at 856).  
Although we have not previously held that there is a 
right to effective assistance of counsel on certiorari review, 
(. . . continued) 
368, 219 P.3d at 1155; State v. Viglielmo, 105 Hawai ʻi 197, 211, 95 P.3d 952, 
966 (2004) (stating that the Hawai ʻi Supreme Court is the ultimate judicial 
tribunal with final, unreviewable authority to interpret and enforce the 
Hawaiʻi Constitution).   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
23 
 it is clear that not providing this right would undermine the 
constitutional right to assistance of counsel on 
such review and 
violate due process.  See  Tetu, 139 Hawaiʻi at 215, 386 P.3d at 
852 (“The constitutional right to the assistance of counsel is 
satisfied only when such assistance is effective.” (internal 
quotations omitted) ( quoting State v. Kahalewai, 54 Haw. 28, 30, 
501 P.2d 977, 979 (1972)); Maddox, 141 Hawaiʻi at 203, 407 P.3d 
at 159.  The Hawai ʻi Constitution therefore guarantees a 
defendant in a criminal case 
the right to the effective 
assistance of counsel on certiorari review in the same manner 
that it does during all other critical stages of the criminal 
proceedings.   
 A Defendant’s Right to the Effective Assistance of Counsel 3.
Includes Compliance b y Counsel w ith the Procedural 
Requirements T o Timely File  an Application for Writ of 
Certiorari.   
 
  This court has previously stated that, “[a]s a general 
rule, compliance with the requirement of timely filing of a 
notice of appeal is jurisdictional, and we must dismiss an 
appeal on our motion if we lack jurisdiction.”   State v. Knight, 
80 Hawai ʻi 318, 323, 909 P.2d 1133, 1138 (1996) (quoting 
Grattafiori v. State, 79 Hawaiʻi 10, 13, 897 P.2d 937, 940 
(1995)).  While the  rule in isolation appears inflexible,  this 
court has allowed unti mely appeals when “defense counsel has ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
24 
 inexcusably or ineffectively failed to pursue a defendant’s 
appeal from a criminal conviction in the first instance.”  Id.  
  In State v. Knight , the defendant filed the  notice of 
appeal from the trial court’s judgmen t of conviction twenty- four 
days after the filing deadline.  80 Hawaiʻi at 323,
 909 P.2d at 
1138.  In an affidavit attached to the statement of 
jurisdiction, counsel for the defendant averred that he prepared 
and signed the notice of appeal prior to the due date , but 
counsel discovered that the notice of appeal had not been filed 
when he returned from a business trip.  Id.   We held that the 
defendant was entitled to the effective assistance of  counsel 
who may not deprive the defendant of an appeal by failing to 
comply with established deadlines.  Id.  at 323-24, 909 P.2d at 
1138-39.  Finding that it was in the interest of justice to 
address the merits of the defendant’s appeal, this court 
declined to dismiss the appeal.  
Id. at 324, 909 P.2d at 1139.  
  In State v. Caraballo, the defendant withdrew his 
appeal based on advice from counsel.  62 Haw. 309, 310, 615 P.2d 
91, 93 (1980).  After the period for filing the notice of appeal 
expired, the defendant learned that counsel’s advice was 
erroneous and thereafter filed a notice of appeal and a motion 
for leave to appeal in forma pauperis.  Id.  at 310-11, 615 P.2d 
at 93-94.  In deciding to consider the case, th is court noted 
that, while  the “time requirement for filing the no tice of ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
25 appeal has been termed ‘ mandatory and jurisdictional ,’” several 
federal and state courts had “relaxed” the timeliness 
requirement for filing a notice of appeal when counsel for the 
defendant was at fault.  Id. at 312-15, 615 P.2d at 94-96.  
Reasoning that the untimely nature of the appeal was due to 
counsel’s erroneous advice, we consider ed the defendant’s  appeal 
on the merits.  Id.  at 316, 615 P.2d at 96.  
While our cases permitting untimely appeals have 
previously involved counsel’s fai lure to timely perfect a notice 
of appeal, the statutes granting a defendant the right to appeal 
to the ICA and the
 statute providing the right to seek this 
court’s discretionary review  of the ICA’s disposition  are 
analogous in providing  a statutory right to appellate review.  
HRS § 641- 12(a) requires that “ the party appealing [a 
district court judgment] shall file notice of the party ’s appeal 
within thirty days, or such other time as may be provided by the 
rules of the court .”  See also HRS § 641- 11 (specifying that a 
defendant may appeal to the ICA from a circuit court judgment 
“in the manner and within the time provided by the rules of 
court”).  In comparison , “[a]n application for a writ of 
certiorari may be filed with the supreme court no later than 
thirty days after the filing of the judgment or dismissal order 
of the intermediate appellate court.”  HRS § 602 -59(c); see also  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
26 
 HRAP Rule 40.1(a)(1) (“The application shall be filed within 30 
days . . . .”).   
Although the statutes governing a notice of appeal may 
appear to be less absolute in their terms than the statute 
concerning the timing for filing a certiorari application, 
closer examination reveals that they are essentially equivalent.  
The statutes permitting a notice of appeal to be filed in 
accordance with the timing requirements prescribed  by court 
rules do not contain an explicit exception for ineffective 
assistance or due process.16  See HRAP Rule 4(b)(1) ( 2016) (“In a 
criminal case, the notice of appeal shall be filed within 30 
days after entry of the judgment or order appealed from.”).  
Notwithstanding HRS § 641-12’s seeming rigidity, our caselaw, as 
discussed supra, has allowed an appeal to proceed despite an  
untimely filing of a notice of appeal when defense counsel has  
inexcusably or ineffectively fail ed to perfect an appeal.   
  Our decisions allowing for review of  the merits of an  
untimely appeal also illustrate that “[t]he right to counsel on 
appeal encompasses not only the appeal itself, but also the 
procedural steps necessary to b ring about the appeal.”  Maddox, 
141 Hawaiʻ i at 203, 407 P.3d at 159.  
In State v. Erwin, the 
                     
 16 While HRAP Rule 2 (2000) permits an appellate court to suspend 
the operation of the court rules for good cause, there is no indication that 
this rule has been invoked to allow for a late filing of a notice of appeal.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
27  
(continued . . .)  
 defendant’s appointed counsel filed the notice of appeal 
thirteen days late.  57 Haw. 268, 268- 69, 554 P.2d 236, 237- 38 
(1976) (per curiam).  Recognizing that an indigent defendant in 
a criminal case is entitled to court- appointed counsel who may 
not deprive the defendant of an appeal by electing to forego 
compliance with procedural rules, we concluded that counsel’s 
failure to “commence the simple steps for appeal  is a blatant 
denial of due process.”  Id. (first citing Entsminger v. Iowa, 
386 U.S. 748 (1966); then quoting Blanchard v. Brewer, 429 F.2d 
89 (8th Cir. 1970)).  We therefore denied the State’s motion to 
dismiss the appeal on the basis that the appeal  was untimely 
filed.  Id.; see also State v. Aplaca, 96 Hawaiʻi 17, 23, 25 P.3d 
792, 798 (2001) (retaining jurisdiction over defendant’s appeal 
“in the interests of justice,” notwithstanding counsel’s failure 
to timely file a notice of appeal);  Knight, 80 Hawaiʻi at 323-24, 
909 P.2d at 1138-39 (applying Erwin to a criminal case without 
reference to whether the defendant was “indigent”).17   
                     
 17 While our cases permitting untimely appeals have involved what 
the appellate court characterized as a “first appeal,” our statutes, rules, 
and caselaw indicate the appeal process includes proceedings  in this court as 
being a stage in the appeal.  For example, HRAP Rule 2.1(b), the definitional 
provision for the appellate rules, provides that an “‘a ppeal’ includes every 
proceeding in the Hawai ʻi appellate courts other than an original action.” 
(Emphasis added).  This unitary nature is also reflected in the statutory 
provision providing for the right to counsel through all steps of an 
“appeal.”  See HRS § 802 –5(a) (requiring the appointment of counsel to 
indigent defendants “ at all stages of the proceedings, including appeal, if 
any” (emphasis added)); Rapozo v. Better Hearing of Hawaii, LLC, 120 Hawai ʻi 
257, 262- 63, 204 P.3d 476, 481 -82 (2009) (“ [T]he appellate process is not a ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
28 
   Likewise, it follows that counsel’s failure to 
“commence the simple steps” to file an application for writ of 
certiorari--a critical stage of the proceedings in the review of 
a criminal conviction-- constitutes ineffective assistance of 
counsel.  Cf. Maddox, 141 Hawai ʻi at 203, 407 P.3d at 159 
(quoting Erwin, 57 Haw. at 270, 554 P.2d at  238).  The 
constitutional due process concerns underpinning this court’s 
decisions permitting a defendant to pursue an untimely appeal 
                                                                               
(. . . continued) 
 
series of discrete actions, but a continuation of the proceedings initiated 
before lower courts.”).   
Additionally, both the ICA’s jurisdiction and the finality of its 
judgments are subject to review by this court upon the acceptance of an 
application for certiorari review.  By statute, the ICA has jurisdiction to 
determine appeals from any court or agency when appeals are allowed by law.  
HRS § 602- 57(1) (2016).  However, the ICA’s judgment on appeal does not 
become effective until the thirty -first day after entry or upon expiration of 
an extended deadline if the time for filing an application for writ of 
certiorari is extended.  HRAP Rule 36(c)(1) (2016).  If an application for 
writ of certiorari is filed, the ICA’s judgment on appeal only becomes 
effective upon entry of the supreme court’s order dismissing or rejecting the 
application or upon entry of the supreme court’s order or other disposition 
affirming in whole the ICA’s judgment.  HRAP Rule 36(c)(2) (2016).  And, 
pursuant to HRAP Rule 41 (2012), acceptance of an application “stays fina lity 
of the [ICA’s] judgment on appeal unless otherwise ordered by the supreme 
court.”  That is, this court’s acceptance of an application stays the 
operation of the ICA decision--which only becomes operative if the decision 
is wholly affirmed--demonstrati ng the continuing nature of the “first 
appeal.”  See HRAP Rule s 36(d)(2) (2016), 41.   
 Accordingly, an application to this court may be considered as a 
part of the “first appeal” because it amounts to a direct continuation of the 
initial proceedings in a defendant’s direct appeal, which have not yet 
terminated.  See HRAP Rule 41; see also  State v. Garcia, 96 Hawai ʻi 200, 214, 
29 P.3d 919, 933 (2001) (“By final we mean where the judgment of conviction 
was rendered, the availability of appeal exhausted, and the time for petition 
for certiorari ha[s] elapsed . . . .”); HRS § 602 -57 (giving the ICA 
jurisdiction to hear appeals from “any court or agency when appeals are 
allowed by law” subject to “transfer .  . . or review on application for a 
writ of certiorari” to the supreme court).  However, because it is 
unnecessary for resolution of this case, we do not resolve whether the  “first 
appeal” is limited to the initial review by an appellate court.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
29 
 when counsel provides ineffective assistance are equally present 
in circumstances when counsel fails to comply with the 
procedural requirements to file a certiorari application.  And, 
counsel’s failure to timely file a certiorari application should 
similarly not result in the forfeiture of a defendant’s 
statutory right to petition the supreme court for discretionary 
review.  See HRS § 602-59(a); cf. Aplaca, 96 Hawai ʻi at 23, 25 
P.3d at 798 (“[F]ailure of [the defendant’s]  counsel to timely 
file the notice of appeal does not divest [the defendant] of 
[the] right to appeal . . . .”).   
  Justice Nakayama’s  opinion dissenting from  the 
judgment recognizes that under our caselaw, “we have permitted 
the review of untimely initial notices of appeal to the ICA in 
limited circumstances” but does not acknowledge the interrelated 
nature of the constitutional and statutory rights 
underlying 
these decisions.  Nakaya ma, J., Dissenting from the Judgment 
(Dissent) at 5.  Instead,  the dissent focuses on the difference 
between the ICA’s mandatory review pursuant to HRS §§ 641-11 and 
641-12 and discretionary review to this court under HRS § 602-
59, thus overlooking the analogous procedures required to 
effectuate review in either court, and in turn, the resulting
 
constitutional violation.   
  Under HRS §§ 641- 11 and 641- 12, the ICA’s review is 
only mandatory if a notice of appeal is timely filed.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
30 
 Similarly, discretionary review under HRS § 602- 59 is dependent 
on the timely filing of an application for writ of certiorari.  
Under either statute, a defendant may elect not to seek 
appellate review.  However, when a defendant chooses to seek 
review, counsel’s failure to follow th e procedural requirements 
under these statutes constitutes ineffective assistance of 
counsel on appeal regardless of whether review would have been 
mandatory or discretionary i n the appellate court.  That is, the 
constitutional violation is occasioned by the same procedural 
error of counsel.   
  Further, courts allowing an untimely notice of appeal 
were cognizant of the fact that “[t]imely filing of a notice of 
appeal has been held to be
 a jurisdictional requirement,” but 
the courts nonetheless reasoned that counsel’s failure to comply 
with procedural requirements deprived a defendant of due process 
such that review of the untimely appeal was warranted.  Erwin , 
57 Haw. at  269, 554 P.2d at 238; see Aplaca, 96 Hawai ʻi at 23, 25 
P.3d at 798; Knight, 80 Hawaiʻ i at 323- 24, 909 P.2d at 1138- 39.  
Thus, the constitutional principle driving our decisions  that 
avoid a due process violation of a defendant’s rights when  a 
notice of appeal is untimely filed applies equally to the 
untimely filing of an application for writ of certiorari.   
  Accordingly, we hold that a defendant in a criminal 
case has the right to effective assistance of counsel during all ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
31  
(continued . . .)  
 stages of an appeal, which includes procedural compliance with 
the statutory requirements for filing an application for writ of 
certiorari.  See HRAP Rule 2.1(b)  (“‘[A]ppeal’ includes every 
proceeding in the Hawai ʻi appellate courts other than an original 
action[.]”); Maddox, 141 Hawaiʻi at 203, 407 P.3d at 159 (holding 
that effective assistance of counsel includes compliance with 
procedural rules).

  “[W]hen a defendant is denied an appeal because of a 
failure or omission of defense counsel, a defendant need not 
demonstrate any additional possibility of impairment to 
establish that counsel was ineffective under article I, sections 
5 and 14 of the Hawai ʻi Constitution.”   Maddox, 141 Hawai ʻi at 
206, 407 P.3d at 162.  In State v. Silva, we held that “in some 
instances, the ineffective assistance of counsel may be so 
obvious from the record that a [Hawaiʻi Rules of P enal Procedure 
(HRPP)] Rule 40 proceeding would serve no purpose except to 
delay the inevitable and expend resources unnecessarily. ”18  75 
                     
 18 HRPP Rule 40 (2006) states in relevant part as follows:  
 
(a) Proceedings and Grounds.  The post -conviction 
proceeding established by this rule shall encompass all 
common law and statutory procedures for the same purpose, 
including habeas corpus and coram nobis; provided that the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

alternative basis for vacating defendant’s conviction ).   
  Additionally, an HRPP Rule 40 post- conviction

In Villados v. State, the  petitioner filed an  untimely pro se 
application for writ of certiorari in the underlying case, 
contending that his court-appointed attorney was at fault for 
the application’s untimeliness .19  No. CAAP-15-0000111, at 2, 
2018 WL 4520933 (App. Sept. 21, 2018) (SDO).  This court 
dismissed the application as untimely.  Id.  Thereafter, the

(b) Institution of proceedings.  A proceeding for post -
conviction relief shall be instituted by filing a petition 
with the clerk of the court in which the conviction  took

special proceeding, and in cases of pro se petitions, 
promptly advise the court of the petition.  
  
 19 In an appended affidavit, the petitioner averred that counsel 
initially indicated that she would file an application for writ of certiorari 
but later informed petitioner after the deadline had passed that she would 
not do so.  State v. Villados, No. SCWC-3 0442, at 2 -3, 2012 WL 3262752 (Haw. 
July 20, 2012) (order dismissing application for writ of certiorari) (Acoba, 
J., dissenting).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
33 
 petitioner initiated an  HRPP Rule 40 proceeding in the Circuit 
Court of the Second Circuit (circuit court), contending that he 
had received ineffective assistance of counsel because of 
counsel’s failure to file the certiorari application and 
requesting, inter alia
, that his conviction be vacated.  Id.  
The circuit court determined that certiorari counsel was 
ineffective for failing to file the application, but it 
concluded that the appropriate relief was to permit  the 
petitioner to seek review from  the supreme court, which the 
court found that it could not grant and thus denied the 
petition.  Id. at 2.  Similarly, the ICA determined on appeal 
that though counsel provided ineffective assistance under our 
decision in Ma ddox, the appropriate remedy “would be to allow 
the petitioner to proceed with the appeal that was precluded by 
the ineffective counsel ”--which relief the ICA determined must 
be obtained from this court.   Id. at 3-6.  Subsequently, in 
February 2019, more than six years after the  original 
application was dismissed as untimely, the petitioner’s 
certiorari application chal lenging the circuit court’s and the 
ICA’s denials of his HRPP Rule 40 petition was accepted by this 
court.  Villados v. State, No. SCWC -15-0000111, 2019 WL 845543 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 (Haw. Feb. 4, 2019) (order accepting application for writ of 
certiorari).20 
  As illustrated by Villados, requiring a defendant to 
initiate an HRPP Rule 40 proceeding in situations when it is 
clear from the record that counsel  has inexcusably or 
ineffectively failed to pursue certiorari review is likely to be 
an inefficient use of judicial resources.  Further, “[t] he fact 
that [the defendant] may have an opportunity to assert 
ineffective assistance of counsel in a future HRPP Rule 40 
petition does not cure the fact that error has already occurred 
and [defendant’s] substantial rights have been adversely 
affected.
”  State v. Villados, No. SCWC-30442, at 10, 2012 WL 
3262752 (Haw. July 20, 2012) (order dismissing application for 
writ of certiorari) 
(Acoba, J., dissenting) (citing Silva, 75 
Haw. at 438-39, 864 P.2d at 592).   
  Post-conviction proceedings  also may be deficient in 
being able to provid e the appropriate relief to remedy counsel’s 
ineffectiveness without returning the case to this court.  
Additionally, the delay caused by requiring a n HRPP Rule 40 
proceeding in circumstances  when counsel concedes fault for a  
certiorari application’s untimeliness --or the fault is  otherwise  
plainly apparent from the record --is unnecessarily exacerbate d.  
                     
 20 At the time this opinion was issued, the case was still pending 
before this court.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
35 By proceeding instead to the merits of a certiorari application 
when the failure to 
timely file the application results from the
ineffective assistance of counsel, we avoid depriving a 
defendant of due process and prevent unnecessary delay to the 
defendant whose rights have been adversely affected.   Indeed, 
HRPP Rule 40(a) specifically provides that the establishment by 
rule of post-conviction proceedings “shall not be construed to 
limit the availability of remedies in the trial court or on 
direct appeal.”  
HRPP Rule 40(a) thus specifically authorizes a 
defendant to seek an available remedy on direct appeal even if 
relief would also be obtainable in a post- conviction proceeding.
See Silva, 75 Haw. at 438–39, 864 P.2d at 592 ( refusing to adopt
the prosecution’s suggested general rule that a defendant may 21 
 
 
21The dissent ’s insistence that an HRPP Rule 40 proceeding is the 
“only legally permissible procedure,” dissent at 9, does not sufficiently 
consider the importance of preserving a defendant’s constitutional rights and 
the analogous caselaw applicable to the untimely filing of a notice of 
appeal.  The legislature has granted a defendant in a criminal case the right 
to appeal to the ICA and the right to seek this court’s discretionary review.  
See HRS §§ 641- 11, 641-12, 602- 59.  The dissent  does not provide an adequate 
explanation as to why this court should treat the forfeiture of either 
statutory right, arising out of the same procedural error by counsel, 
differently.  Instead, the dissent would require a defendant to proceed with 
an HRPP Rule 40 petition and a likely appeal to remedy the constitutional 
violation in situations when the due process violation is clear from the 
record and this court is capable of remedying it in the first instance.  See 
Silva, 75 Haw. at 438 -39, 864 P.2d at 592.  It is not efficient for our court 
system to require that a defendant initiate an HRPP Rule 40 proceeding that 
may take several years to resolve, in contrast to an immediate discretionary 
determination by this court as to whether the certiorari application should 
be accepted.  See, e.g., Villados, No. SCWC -15-0000111; Villados, No. CAAP-
15-0000111 (as of the date of this opinion, the case initiated over six years
earlier under HRPP Rule 40 as a result of counsel’s admitted failure to
timely file the certiorari application was still pending in this  court).***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 only assert ineffective assistance of counsel in a post -
conviction proceeding under HRPP Rule 40) .  
  Justice Nakayama’s dissent contends that our opinion 
“opens the door” to requiring this court to review all 
certiorari applications regardless of their timeliness,  
rendering procedural requirements for filing applications in 
criminal cases “ moot.”  Dissent at 7-9.  The dissent broadly 
overstates the limited impact of allowing this court to review 
applications that but for counsel’s procedural error  would 
otherwise have been timely filed.   
 
 First, attorneys in Hawai ʻi are su
bject to Rule 1.3 
(2014) of the Hawai ʻi Rules of Professional Conduct (HRPC), which 
requires that, “A lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and 
promptness in representing a client. ”  As such,  attorneys have a 
duty to comply with procedural requirements including statutory 
deadlines.  Because counsel is required to “keep the client 
reasonably informed about the status of the matter,” HRPC Rule 
1.4(a)(3) (2014), 
and because a defendant in a criminal appeal 
is generally focused on the status of 
the appeal, it is unlikely 
that counsel’s ineffectiveness in not timely filing a certiorari 
application would go undiscovered until years later as the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
37 
 dissent portends.22  Dissent at 7.  Even assuming  such a 
discovery were to occur years later, this court has 
discretionary authority to dismiss the application as untimely 
and require the defendant to proceed under HRPP  Rule 40.   
  Second, because counsel’s ineffectiveness must be 
clear from the record, counsel will be required to  admit 
responsibility for the late filing, unless it is apparent from 
the record that counsel is 
at fault for the application’s 
untimeliness.  In circumstances w
hen the record is unclear, the 
court may dismiss the application so that a proceeding 
may be 
commenced in the trial court pursuant to HRPP Rule 40(f).  See 
HRPP Rule 40(f) (providing for an opportunity for counsel to be 
heard regarding allegations of ineffective assistance).  The 
dissent thus  incorrectly assumes that an untimely application 
will necessarily demonstrate counsel’s noncompliance with 
procedural requirements when this is unequivocally not the case.  
Dissent at 7-8 . 
Further, our decision today will affect significantly 
fewer cases than what our law already allows when a notice of 
appeal is not timely filed in a criminal case.  This is because 
the number of potential criminal cases in which a certiorari 
application is not timely filed is a much smaller pool than all 
                     
 22 In this case, counsel filed the untimely application six days 
after the application’s deadline.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
38 
 criminal cases in which an appeal may be taken.  Additionally, 
counsel’s ineffectiveness must be clear from the record in order 
for this court to consider an untimely filed application.23  
Finally, the proposition that “[s]ignificantly more judicial 
resources will be depleted attempting to meet these additional 
demands,” dissent at 10, is plainly refuted by the avoidance of 
an unnecessary HRPP 
Rule 40 proceeding, the hearing on the 
petition, and subsequent appeals, when the untimely application 
is reviewed on its merits-- as it would have been but for 
counsel’s admitted error.24   
  Therefore, we hold that this court may decline to 
dismiss an application for writ of certiorari as untimely and 
proceed to review its merits when it is plain from the record 
that defense counsel failed to comply with the procedural 
requirements for filing the application.   Cf. Knight, 80 Hawaiʻi 
                     
  
 23 Nor is there any concern that attorneys would falsely accept 
responsibility for filing an untimely certiorari application as doing so 
would violate the HRPC, render an attorney subject to disciplinary action, 
and affect the counsel’s professional reputation.  See HRPC Rule 3.3(a)(1) 
(2014) (“A lawyer shall not knowingly . . . make a false statement of 
material fact or law to a tribunal[.]”); HRPC Rule 8.4(c) (2014) (“It is 
professional misconduct for a lawyer to . . . engage in conduct involving 
dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation[.]”); HRPC Rule 8.4 cmt. [1] 
(2014) (stating lawyers are subject to discipline for violating the HRPC).  
 
 24 For instance, in Villados, the defendant’s HRPP Rule 40 petition -
-based solely on the claim that counsel ineffectively failed to file an 
application for certiorari review in the defendant’s initial appeal --was 
subject to proceedings in both the circuit court and the ICA prior to 
reaching this court.  Villados, No. CAAP- 15-0000111.  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
39 
 at 324, 909 P.2d at 1139 (declining to dismiss defendant’s 
appeal in the interest of justice notwithstanding counsel’s 
failure to timely file a notice of appeal).  This authority to 
proceed to the merits of an untimely application may be 
exercised when it is necessary to prevent a violation of due 
process or is in the interests of justice.25  See Aplaca, 96 
Hawaiʻi at 23, 25 P.3d at 798 ( “[F]ailure of [the defendant’s]  
counsel to timely file the notice of appeal does not divest [the 
defendant] of his right to appeal, and, therefore, in the 
interests of justice, we decline to dismiss [the defendant’s ] 
appeal and retain jurisdiction over it. ”).   
 The Circumstances of This Case Merit Consideration  of Uchima’s 5.
Application.  
  Turning to the present case, in the motion to accept, 
counsel averred that he intended to file Uchima’s A pplication 
for certiorari review and thought that he had done so, but 
counsel later discovered that the A pplication had not been 
                     
 25 Justice Nakayama’s dissent is mistaken that our decision 
“attempts to derive a new right of a criminal defendant to appeal the ICA’s 
judgment that does not exist,” dissent at 7, because our opinion only allows 
a defendant’s application for writ of certiorari to proceed as if the 
constitutional violation had not occurred.  Our decision does not affect this 
court’s ability to reject a  certiorari application on its merits or dismiss 
it as untimely.  Instead, this opinion harmonizes and preserves the 
constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel on appeal and the 
statutory right to petition this court for review of the ICA’s decision.  Cf. 
Pitts, 131 Hawaiʻ i at 544 n.6, 319 P.3d at 463 n.6 (stating that the court’s 
remand order “seeks only to place Pitts in the position he would have been in 
had the constitutional violation never occurred” notwithstanding the deadline 
to file a motion for new trial).   
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
40 
 properly filed.  If the failure to timely file the A pplication 
was the result of counsel’s error, then counsel’s “failure to 
fulfill procedural requirements resulted in the loss of 
[Uchima’s] right” to petition this court for review.  Maddox, 
141 Hawai ʻi at 20
5, 407 P.3d at 161.  Even if the failure to 
perfect Uchima’s Application was the result of computer system 
error, counsel acknowledges that he did not receive an email 
confirming that a case for Uchima’s Application was created.  
Counsel thus  omitted to confirm that Uchima’s Application was 
successfully filed.  See id. (“[W]e hold that when a defendant 
is denied an appeal because of a failure or omission of defense 
counsel, a defendant need not demonstrate any additional 
possibility of impairment to establish that counsel was 
ineffective . . . .”); Knight, 80 Hawai ʻi at 323, 909 P.2d at 
1138 (declining to dismiss untimely notice of appeal when 
counsel indicated that he prepared and signed a notice of appeal 
but did not discover that it had not been filed until returning 
from a business trip).  
  Hence , Uchima did not receive effective assistance of 
counsel with regard to the timely filing of his Application.  
Although Uchima may assert an ineffectiveness assistance claim 
through the initiation of a
n HRPP Rule 40 proceeding , the record 
is clear that Uchima’s co unsel intended to file the  Application 
and that but for counsel’s error or omission the Application ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
41 
 would have been timely filed.  This court has previously ruled 
on ineffective assistance claims without requiring a post-
conviction proceeding when the inef fective assistance of counsel 
was plain from the record.  See, e.g. , Pacheco, 96 Hawai ʻi at 
102, 26 P.3d at 591 (holding that the record on appeal 
conclusively established that counsel was ineffective); Aplaca , 
74 Haw. at 72,  837 P.2d at 1307 -08 (concluding counsel provided 
ineffective assistance based on a review of the record).  
Requiring Uchima to proceed with an HRPP  Rule 40 petition under 
the facts of this case would only unnecessarily prolong final 
determination of Uchima’s appeal and result in an inefficient 
use of judicial resources.  Silva , 75 Haw. at 438- 39, 864 P.2d 
at 592 (“[I] n some instances, the ineffective assistance of 
counsel may be so obvious from the record that [an HRPP] Rule 40  
proceeding would serve no purpose except to delay the inevitable 
and expend resources unnecessarily.” ). 
  Therefore, to avoid the  due process violation that 
would otherwise occur in this case , we decline to dismiss 
Uchima’s Application “[i]n the interest of justice ” and thus 
proceed to consider its merits .  Knight, 80 Hawai ʻi at 324, 909 
P.2d at 1139 (holding that it was in the “interest of justice” 
to address the merits of the defendant’s appeal notwithstanding 
the untimely filing of the notice of appeal) .  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
42 
 B. The ICA Did Not Err in Affirming the Distr ict Court’s 
Judgment. 
  In his application, Uchima presents two questions for 
review: (1) whether the ICA gravely erred in affirming the 
district court’s denial of Uchima’s motion to suppress his 
answers to the medical rule- out questions and his verbal 
statements and non- verbal communicative actions on the FST;  and 
(2) whether the ICA gravely erred in holding that there was 
substantial evidence to support his conviction.   
 Tsujimura  Is Not Applicable to the Facts of T his Case. 1.
  Uchima first contends that he had a pre -arrest right 
to remain silent pursuant to State v. Tsujimura, 140 Hawai ʻi 299, 
400 P.3d 500 (2017), that his verbal and non- verbal responses 
were obtained in violation of this right, and that his responses 
should therefore have been suppressed.   
  In Tsujimura, the defendant was charged by complaint 
with OVUII.  140 Hawai ʻi at 302, 400 P.3d at 503.  At trial, an 
HPD officer testified that the defendant, prior to undergoing an 
FST, stated that he had an old injury to his left knee.  Id. at 
303, 400 P.3d at 504.  The State on redirect examination asked 
the officer whether the defendant had explained while exiting 
the car that he could not get out of the car because of a 
previous leg injury.  Id.  at 304-05, 400 P.3d at 505- 06.  Over 
defense counsel’s repeated objections, the officer responded ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
43 
 that “[n]o statements were made.”  Id. at 305, 400 P.3d at 506 
(emphasis omitted).  We held that the information regarding the 
defendant’s pre-arrest silence was improperly admitted into 
evidence as it violated the defendant’s right against self -
incrimination a nd was used  as substantive proof of guilt.  Id. 
at 316-17, 400 P.3d at 517- 18.   
  By contrast, this case does not involve the use of 
Uchima’s silence against him.  Here, Officer Townsend asked 
Uchima questions, and Uchima provided responses.  For example, 
when asked whether he would participate in the  FST, Uchima 
consented and exited his vehicle.  In addition, the State did 
not seek to introduce and use evidence of Uchima’s silence 
against him at trial.  Thus, Tsujimura is not applicable to the 
facts of this case.   
 The ICA Did Not Err in Affirming the District Court’s Ruling 2.
on Uchima’s Motion to Suppress.  
  Uchima argues that he was subjected to custodial 
interrogation and, because he was not given Miranda  warnings, 
his responses to Officer Townsend and the officer’s description 
of his physical actions during the FST should have been 
suppressed.  Uchima also argues that the medical rule-out 
questions were incriminating because they served to “rule in” a 
direct cause of impairment or “rule out” any explanation other 
than intoxication for d eviations in a subject’s FST performance.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
44 
 Hence, Uchima contends that Officer Townsend’s testimony as to 
his responses and performance during the FST must be suppressed 
as the “fruit of the poisonous tree of the preceding 
illegalities.”  
  Under t he Fifth Amendment to the United States 
Constitution and article I, section 10 of the Hawai ʻi 
Constitution, a person in a criminal case cannot be compelled to 
be a witness against oneself.  This court has long held
 that 
article I, section 10 of the Hawaiʻi Constitution provides an 
independent source for the protections which the United States 
Supreme Court enumerated in Miranda .  State v. Kazanas, 138 
Hawaiʻi 23, 34, 375 P.3d 1261, 1272  (2016); see State v. 
Santiago, 53 Haw. 254, 265-66, 492 P.2d 657, 664 (1971).  Thus, 
as a matter of state constitutional law, statements stemming 
from custodial interrogation may not be used by the State unless 
it “first demonstrate[s] the use of procedural safeguards 
effective to secure the privilege against self -incrimination .”  
Kazanas, 138 Hawai ʻi at 34, 375 P.3d at 1272 (quoting State v. 
Ikaika, 67 Haw. 563, 566, 698 P.2d 281, 283-84 (1985)). 
  “A critical safeguard is the Miranda warning[. ]”  Id.  
Our caselaw has stated that “[t] wo criteria are required before 
Miranda rights must be given: (1) the defendant must be under 
interrogation; and (2) the defendant must be in custody.”   State 
v. Kauhi, 86 Hawai ʻi 195, 204, 948 P.2d 1036, 1045 (1997) ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
45 
 (quoting State v. Blanding, 69 Haw. 583, 586, 752 P.2d 99, 100 
(1988)).   
  We have previously stated that “[i]nterrogation 
encompasses not only express questioning, but also any words or 
actions on the part of the police (other than those normally  
attendant to  arrest and custody) that the police should know are 
reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the 
suspect.”  State v. Trinque, 140 Hawai ʻi 269, 277, 400 P.3d 470, 
478 (2017) (alterations and internal quotations omitted) 
(quoting State v. Joseph, 109 Hawai ʻi 482, 495, 128 P.3d 795, 808 
(2006)). 
  Here, Officer Townsend asked Uchima whether he would 
participate in an FST, whether he understood the instructions of 
the individual tests, and whether he had any questions.  These 
preliminary questions were not reasonably likely to lead to 
incriminating responses because neither an affirmative or 
negative response to these questions is incriminating.  Rather, 
the questions allow the officer to determine whether Uchima was 
willing to undergo the FST and whether he understood the 
officer’s instructions prior  to performing the three tests 
comprising the FST.  Thus, these questions were not of such 
nature that Officer Townsend should have known that they were 
likely to elicit an incriminating response.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
46 
   With respect to the medical rule- out questions asked 
by Officer Townsend and whether Uchima’s responses to the se 
questions should have been suppressed, the district court 
specifically ruled at the conclusion of the suppression hearing 
that the answers to the medical rule- out questions “would have 
no probative value, no inculpatory or exculpatory value”  in the 
trial part of the proceeding.  Thus, in essence, the district 
court granted the defense’s motion to suppress as to the medical 
rule-out questions when it determined that Uchima’s responses to 
these questions  would have no inculpatory or exculpatory value.  
Uchima therefore can show no prejudice from Officer Townsend ’s 
testimony as to his responses to the medical rule- out questions.  
  Uchima’s  performance on the FST does not constitute 
incriminating statements.  “[T]he privilege [against self -
incrimination] is a bar against compelling ‘communications’ or 
‘testimony[.] ’”  State v. Wyatt, 67 Haw. 293, 303, 687 P.2d 544, 
551 (1984) (quoting Schmer ber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 763-
64 (1966)).  In Wyatt, this court held that when conducting an 
FST the State does not seek “communications” or “testimony,” but 
rather, “an exhibition of ‘physical characteristics of 
coordination.’”  Id. (quoting State v. Arsenault , 336 A.2d 244, 
247 (N.H. 1975)).  Here, Officer Townsend did not seek 
“communications” or “testimony” from Uchima.  Rather, in 
conducting the FST, the officer sought “an  exhibition of ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
47 
 ‘physical characteristics of coordination.’”  Id.  
“Consequently, the field sobriety test was not rendered infirm 
by the constitutionally guaranteed privilege against compulsory 
self-incrimination.”26  Id. 
  In sum, neither the questions asked by the officer 
prior to and during the administration of the FST nor Uch ima’s 
performance on the FST constituted an interrogation requiring 
Miranda warnings.  Nor did Uchima suffer any prejudice from the 
testimony of his answers to the medical rule- out questions as 
the court accorded no evidentiary value to his responses to the 
questions.  The ICA therefore did not err in affirming the 
denial of Uchima’s motion to suppress.27   
 There Was Substantial Evidence To Support Uchima’s Conviction . 3.
  Uchima was convicted of OVUII in violation of HRS 
§ 291E-61(a)(1).  Under HRS § 291E-61(a)(1),  
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle 
under the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates 
or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:  
 (1) While under the influence of alcohol in an amount

 26 Uchima indicates  in a footnote of his Application that the United 
States Supreme Court, in Pennsylvania v. Muniz , noted that the officer’s 
request in that case to count aloud during two tests of the FST were 
“exceptions” to the Court’s rule concerning “carefully scripted 
instructions.”  (Citing 496 U.S. 582, 603 n.17 (1990).)  As in that case, 
Uchima does not argue that his failure to count during the walk -and-turn test 
had any independent incriminating significance.  See id.  We therefore do not 
further address this issue.  
 
 27 In light of our analysis, it is unnecessary to address whether 
Uchima was in custody for purposes of requiring Miranda warnings.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 faculties or ability to care for the person and guard

  In this case, Officer Townsend testified that he saw 
Uchima’s vehicle crossi ng over the broken white lines on  
Beretania Street for approximately 30 to 40 yards.  The officer 
testified that after approaching the vehicle following the 
traffic stop, there was an odor of alcohol emitting from Uchima 
and that Uchima had slurred speech, red and watery eyes, and 
flushed skin.  When Uchima exited his vehicle, O fficer Townsend 
testified, Uchima was “unsteady on his feet” and had to use his 
hand to lean against the vehicle as support to keep his balance.   
  In addition, Officer Townsend’s t estimony indicated 
that Uchima demonstrated multiple clues suggesting intoxication 
on each of the three tests administered, including the 
following: on the horizontal nystagmus test-- not keeping his 
head still while following Officer Townsend’s pen with hi s eyes; 
on the walk- and-turn test-- pausing and missing his heel- to-toe 
steps during the first nine steps, stepping off line on each 
step, and raising his hands to keep balance; and on the one- leg 
stand test-- swaying in all directions, showing difficulty in 
balancing, and putting his foot down and hopping at different 
points during the test.   
  Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to 
the State, there was substantial evidence to support Uchima’s 
conviction of OVUII under HRS § 291E- 61(a)(1).   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
