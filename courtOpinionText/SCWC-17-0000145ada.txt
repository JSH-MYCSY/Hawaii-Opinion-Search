OPINION OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J. 
 
I.  Introduction  
 This certiorari proceeding arises out of a civil lawsuit 
brought by condominium owners whose unit was nonjudicially 
foreclosed by their association of apartment owners.  The unit 
was then sold by their association for substantially less than Electronically Filed

 fair market value, leaving the
 owners not only without their 
home, but also with mortgage  liability .   
 On December 13, 201
6, Gilbert V. Malabe and Daisy D. Malabe 
(“Malabes”) then filed a c omplaint in the Circuit Court of the 
First Circuit ( “circuit court ”) against the Association of 
Apartment Owners of Executive Centre, by and through i ts Board 
of Directors ( “AOAO”).  The complaint asserted claims for 
wrongful foreclosure and unfair or deceptive acts or practices 
(“UDAP”) based on the AOAO ’s nonjudicial foreclosure and 
December 17, 2010 public sale of the Malabes ’ condominium 
apartment due to unpaid assessment fees.  On February 17 , 2017, 
the circuit court1 granted the AOAO ’s Hawaiʻi Rules of Civil 
Procedure (“HRCP ”) Rule 12(b)(6) (1996) motion to dismiss the 
complaint for “failure to state a claim upon which relief can be 
granted,”  and entered final judgment.   
The Malabes appealed to the Intermediate C ourt of Appeals 
(“ICA”).  The ICA concluded that based on its decision in Sakal 
v. Ass’n of Apartment Owners of Hawaiian Monarch, 143 Hawaiʻ i 
219, 426 P.3d 443 (App. 2018),  cert. denied , 2018 WL 6818901 
(Dec. 28, 2018), cert. granted, 2019 WL 245225 (Jan. 17, 2019),2 
                         
1  The Honorable Rhonda A. Nishimura presided.  
 
2  In summary, the ICA held in Sakal  that because no statutory power of 
sale existed, “in order for [an]  association to avail itself of the 
nonjudicial power of sale foreclosure procedures set  forth in Hawaiʻ i Revised 
Statutes
 [] chapter 667,” “ a power of sale in favor of a foreclosing ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***

 because the AOAO lacked a power of sale, the circuit court erred 
in dismissing Count I, the Malabes’  wrongful foreclosure claim.  
See Malabe v. Ass ’n of Apartment Owners of Executive Ctr., CAAP-
17-0000145, 2018 WL 6258564, at 7 (App. Nov. 29, 2018) (SDO).  
The ICA affirmed the circuit court, however, with respect to its 
dismissal of Count II, holding the Malabes’  UDAP claim time-
barred and equitable tolling for fraudulent concealment 
inapplicable.  See Malabe, SDO at 9 –10.  
On certiorari, the  AOAO asserts the  ICA erred in vacating 
the circuit court ’s dismissal of Count I, the wrongful 
foreclosure claim.  The Malabes assert the ICA  erred in  
affirming the circuit court ’s dismissal of Count II, the UDAP 
claim.  
 We hold the ICA did not err in reinstating Count I, the 
Malabes’ wrongful foreclosure claim, based on its ruling in 
Sakal, which correctly held that in order for an association to
utilize the nonjudicial
 power of sale foreclosure procedures 
set forth in Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (“HRS” ) Chapter 667, a 
power of sale in 
its favor must have existed in association 
bylaws or in another enforceable agreement with unit 
owners.  143 Hawai ʻi at 220-21, 426 P.3d 444-45.    
                                                                               
(. . .continued)  
association must otherwise exist in the association ’s bylaws or another 
enforceable agreement with its unit owners .”  143 Hawai ʻi at 220- 21, 426 P.3d 
at 444-45.    ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***

  We further hold Act 282 of 2019  (“Act 282”)3 does not affect 
this holding , as the statutory changes therein do not affect the 
Malabes’ claims, which are based on HRS § 667-5 repealed in 
2012.  We therefore do not address the Malabes ’ constitutional 
challenges to Act 282, as “[a] fundamental and longstanding 
principle of judicial restraint requires that courts avoid 
reaching constitutional questions in advance of the necessity of 
deciding them. ”  Rees v. Carlise, 113 Hawai ʻi 446, 456, 153 P.3d 
1131, 1141 (2007).  W e note, however, that on April 10, 2020, 
the United States District Court for the District of Hawai ʻi held 
Act 282 unconstitutional as violative of the Contracts Clause of 
Article I, § 10 of the United States Constitution.   4
 We further hold the ICA erred in affirming the circuit 
court’s dismissal of Count II by deeming the Malabes ’ UDAP claim 
time-barred.  Based on “notice pleading”  standards and  the 
principle that in ruling on HRCP 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss,  
allegations within a complaint must be accepted as true, Bank of 
America, N.A. v. Reyes- Toledo, 143 Hawai ʻi 249, 257, 428 P.3d 
                         
3  On July 10, 2019, Senate Bill 551, “ A Bill for an Act Relating to 
Condominiums,”  was enacted as Act 282 without the Governor ’s signature.  See 
2019 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 282, §§ 1 -9, at 779- 83; 2019 House Journal, at 734 -

Owners of Palm Court, CIV. NO. 16- 00023 LEK -RT, 2020 WL 1822599, at *13 (D. 
Haw. Apr. 10, 2020), “[t]he Contracts Clause restricts the power of States to 
disrupt contractual arrangements.  It provides that ‘[n]o state shall . . .

the Malabes ’ UDAP claim should not have been 
dismissed.  
 We therefore remand this matter to the circuit court for 
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.   
II.  Background  
A. Factual and procedural background  
 1. Complaint 
 As this case was dismissed via
 a HRCP Rule 12(b) (6) (2000)5 
motion to dismiss, the following allegations within the Malabes’ 
December 13, 2016 complaint  must be accepted as true.  Reyes-
Toledo, 143 Hawai ʻi at 257, 428 P.3d at 769 .  The following are 
relevant allegations of the Malabes’ complaint.  
 In or around May 2005, the Malabes purchased Apartment 1907 
in the Executive Centre condominium project located at 1088 
Bishop Street, Honolulu, Hawai ʻi (“Apartment ”).  The purchase 
price was $225,000, paid in part with a $180,000 loan secured by 
                         
5  HRCP Rule 12(b)(6) states:  
 
Every defense, in law or fact, to a claim for relief in any 
pleading, whether a claim, counterclaim, cross -claim, or 
third-party claim, shall be asserted in the responsive 
pleading thereto if one is required, except that the 
following defenses may at the option of the pleader be made 
by motion: . . . (6) failure to state a claim upon which 
relief can be granted[.] . . . If, on a motion asserting 
the defense numbered (6) to dismiss for failure of the 
pleading to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, 
matters outside the pleading are presented  to and not 
excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one 
for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 
56, and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity 
to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by 
Rule 56.  ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***

 a mortgage on the Apartment.  The AOAO is the homeowner 
association for Executive Centre. 
 The AOAO did not hold a 
mortgage containing a power of sale on or secured by the 
Apartment.   
 On or about December 17, 2010, 
without providing the 
Malabes actual or adequate notice of default and an opportunity 
to cure the default, acting on advice it received, the AOAO 
published notice that it would sell the Apartment at a public 
sale pursuant to HRS § 667-5 (repealed 2012)6 and HRS Chapters 
514A and 514B.7  The AOAO pursu ed a nonjudicial foreclosure 
                         
6  As of the date of the Malabes ’ nonjudicial foreclosure, HRS § 667 -5 
provided in relevant part as follows:  
 
§667-5  Foreclosure under power of sale; notice; affidavit 
after sale.   (a)  When a power of sale is contained in a 
mortgage, and where the mortgagee, the mortgagee ’s 
successor in interest, or any person authorized by the 
power to act in the premises, desires to foreclose under 
power of sale upon breach of a condition of the mortgage, 
the mortgagee, successor, or person shall be represented by 
an attorney who is licensed to practice law in the State 
and is physically located in the State.   The attorney 
shall: 
 
     (1)  Give notice of the mortgagee ’s, successor ’s, or  
     person’ s intention to foreclose the    
     mortgage . . . ; and 
  
   (2)  Give any notices and do all acts as are   
     authorized or required by the power contained in      
     the mortgage.  
 
(Emphasis added.)  
 
 As explained in Santiago v. Tanaka, 137 Hawaiʻ i 137, 366 P.3d 612 
(2016), “[p]rior to its repeal in 2012,  HRS § 667- 5 authorized the non -
judicial foreclosure of mortgaged property only ‘[w]hen a power of sale is 
contained in a mortgage.’”  137 Hawai ʻi at 154, 366 P.3d at 629 (second 
alteration in original).  
 ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***

 through HRS § 667- 5 to circumvent the consumer protection 
provisions contained in HRS §§ 667- 21 through 667- 42 (Supp. 
2008).8  The AOAO had fraudulently concealed the wrongfulness of 
the foreclosure proceedings by implying, stating, and 
misrepresenting that it held a mortgage with a power of sale 
when it did not, or that it was authorized to use HRS § 667-5 
when it could not.  The Malabes relied on the false statements 
and representations of the AOAO concerning the AOAO ’s right to 
conduct a public sale pursuant to HRS § 667-5.   The Malabes were 
entitled to so rely because they were members of the AOAO, 
because of the AOAO ’s trustee- like relationship with  the 
                                                                               
(. . .continued)  
This court examined HRS § 667 -5 in Lee v. HSBC Bank USA, 
121 Hawai ʻi 287, 218 P.3d 775 (2009), and found that it 
authorized nonjudicial foreclosure under a power of sale 
contained in a mortgage.  In Lee, the plaintiffs argued, 
and this court agreed, that no state statute creates a 
right in mortgagees to proceed by non- judicial foreclosure; 
the right is created by contract.   
 
137 Hawaiʻ i at 154 -55, 366 P.3d at 629 -30 (internal citations, emphases, 
brackets, and quotation marks omitted).  
 
7  HRS Chapter 514A, which was repealed effective January 1, 2019, was 
titled, “Condominium Property Regimes.”  HRS Chapter 514B is the Condominium 
Property Act.  See  infra note 17. 
 
8  These sections constitute Part II of HRS Chapter 667, an “Alternate 
Power of Sale Foreclosure Process.”  Part II of HRS Chapter 667 provid es 
protections exceeding that available in Part I of HRS Chapter 667, which 
contained HRS § 667 -5 until 2012, by, for example, outlining specific notice 
requirements, including “[t]he date by which the default must be cured, which 
deadline date shall be at  least sixty days after the date of the notice of 
default[. ]”  HRS § 667 -22(a)(6) (Supp. 2010).  Part II of HRS Chapter 667  was 
at issue in Sakal.  143 Hawaiʻi at 221, 426 P.3d at 445.  Therefore, pursuant 
to Sakal, the AOAO would also not have been authorized to proceed under Part 
II of HRS Chapter 667 . ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***

 Malabes, and because the AOAO was acting as an agent or attorney 
on behalf of the Malabes pursuant to HRS § 667- 10 (1993).9  
 At the sale, the AOAO successfully bid on the Apartment in 
an amount that did not constitute adequate consideration, and on 
January 4, 2011, the AOAO  executed a quitclaim deed for the 
Apartment as both the grantor and grantee.  The quitclaim deed 
was recorded on January 7, 2011.  As a result of the public 
sale, the Malabes lost the Apartment, but remain liable for the 
amount secured by the mortgage.  The Malabes did not discover 
their claims against the AOAO until sometime in or around July 
2016.  On January 11, 2017, the AOAO filed a motion to d ismiss 
the Malabes’ complaint.  With respect to Count I, the AOAO 
argued that the Malabes ’ wrongful foreclosure claim, based on 
their allegations that the AOAO improperly relied on HRS § 667- 5 
as a basis for the foreclosure, failed as a matter of law 
because (1) the Malabes ’ claim should have been raised as a 
defense to the foreclosure action, instead of belatedly raised 
as an affirmative cause of action; (2) the AOAO properly 
                         
9   Power unaffected by transfer; surplus after sale.   No  
sale or transfer by the mortgagor shall impair or annul any 
right or power of attorney given in the mortgage to the 
mortgagee to sell or transfer the mortgaged property, as 
attorney or agent of the mortgagor, except as otherwise 
provided by chapters 501 and 502. . . .

 conducted the foreclosure pursuant to HRS §  514B-146 (2006)10 and 
HRS § 667-5; and (3) Hawaiʻi had not recognized a cause of action 
for wrongful foreclosure.11   
With respect to Count II, the AOAO argued that the Malabes ’ 
UDAP claim (1) was time-barred by the four- year limitations 
period set forth in HRS § 480- 24 (2008),12 which began to run “in 
                         
10  HRS § 514B -146 states in relevant part:  
 
Association fiscal matters; lien for assessments.   [Repeal 
and reenactment on December 31, 2007.  L 2005, c 93, § 7; L 
2006, c 373, § 32.]  (a) All sums assessed by the 
association but unpaid for the share of the common expenses 
chargeable to any unit shall constitute a lien on the unit 
. . . .  The lien of the association may be foreclosed by 
action or by nonjudicial or power of sale foreclosure 
procedures set forth in chapter 667, by the managing agent 
or board, acting on behalf of the association, in like 
manner as a mortgage of real property.

11  Santiago was decided on January 15, 2016, and stated “we conclude that 
the Santiagos are entitled to restitution . . . from Tanaka’s wrongful 
foreclosure of the Mortgage and subsequent sale of the Tavern.”  137 Hawai ʻi 
at 158, 366 P.3d a
t 633.  On November 16, 2016, this court ruled in another 
case that “[u]pon remand, the circuit court is to apply Santiago to determine 
an appropriate remedy for the wrongful foreclosure.”  Mount v. Apao, 139 
Hawaiʻi 167, 180, 383 P.3d 1268, 1281 (2016).  Before that, Kondaur Capital 
Corp. v. Matsuyoshi, 136 Hawaiʻ i 227, 361 P.3d 454 (2015) discussed the 
predecessor statute to HRS § 667 -5, and held that duties set forth in Ulrich 
v. Security Investment  Co., 35 Haw. 158 (Haw. Terr. 1939), that a “mortgagee 
seeking to enforce a non -judicial foreclosure sale bears the burden of 
establishing that the sale was conducted in a manner that is fair, reasonably 
diligent, and in good faith and that an adequate price was procured for the 
property[,]” were applicable to  HRS § 667 -5.  136 Hawai ʻi at 229, 235- 41, 361 
P.3d at 456, 462 -68.  It appears that Hawai ʻi  may have actually recognized a 
wrongful foreclosure claim as early as 1883, in Johnson v. Tisdale, 4 Haw. 
605 (Haw. Kingdom 1883).  
 
12  HRS § 480- 24 states in relevant part:  
  
  Limitation of actions.   (a)  Any action to enforce a cause  
of action arising under this chapter shall be barred unless 
commenced within four years after the cause of action 
accrues, except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) and 
section 480- 22.  For the purpose of this section, a cause ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***

 or around December 2010/January 2011
,” and equitable tolling 
under HRS § 657- 20 (1993) did not apply; and (2) failed as a 
matter of law because the  AOAO did not conduct trade or commerce 
and the Malabes are not consumers in an adversarial foreclosure 
procedure.   
In opposition, in summary, with respect to Count I, the 
Malabes argued that (1) wrongful foreclosure is a valid and 
recognized claim
 and is not required to be raised as a defense 
to a nonjudicial foreclosure, and their claim was timely raised 
within the applicable six- year statute of limitations period; 
and (2) because the AOAO was not authorized to foreclose 
pursuant to HRS § 667-5, the AOAO ’s compliance with the statute 
did not bar a claim of wrongful foreclosure.   
Regarding Count II, the Malabes did not controvert the 
AOAO’s assertion that the limitations period began in December 
2010/January 2011, but instead argued that equitable tolling for 
fraudulent concealment applied.  The Malabes emphasized they 
were not accusing the AOAO of concealing the law, but rather of 
concealing a fact.   
At the February 2, 2017 hearing on the motion to dismiss,  
the AOAO summarized the issue as being “ whether 514B- 146 
[(2006)] gives the Association authority for the purposes of

11 
 utilizing nonjudicial foreclosure. ”  The AOAO argued that     
HRS § 514B-146 gives broad authority to associations to use all 
forms of foreclosure available in HRS Chapter 667.
  The Malabes 
argued that even if the AOAO could foreclose “in like manner as 
a mortgage,” the AOAO was required to use statutes that 
explicitly allow their use 
because the AOAO did not have a power 
of sale.  The Malabes maintained that if the AOAO wanted to 
conduct a nonjudicial 
foreclosur e, it would have to have been 
under Part II of HRS Chapter 667.13  They argued the AOAO could 
not rely on HRS § 667 -5 because it did not have a mortgage 
containing a power of sale.  The Malabes also argued that the 
statute of limitations did not begin to run until they 
discovered the violations in 2016, arguing that t he discovery 
rule is an equitable principle.  
At the hearing, the circuit court indicated it was granting 
the motion to dismiss, but did not state the grounds for its 
ruling. 
The circuit court granted the m otion to d ismiss in its 
entirety by an order filed on February 17, 2017.  Final ju dgment 
in favor of the AOAO was entered the same day.   
B. Appeal to the ICA  
The Malabes appealed the dismissal of their complaint to 
the ICA.   
                         
13  See supra note 8.   ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
12 
 The ICA agreed with the Malabes that Count I, the wrongful 
foreclosure claim, should not have been dismissed.   See Malabe, 
SDO at 5–7.   The ICA cited to Santiago , 137 Hawai ʻi at 154, 366 
P.3d at 629 , which held that “prior to its repeal in 2012,    
HRS § 667-5 authorized the non- judicial foreclosure of mortgaged 
property only when a power of sale is contained in a mortgage, ” 
as HRS § 667-5 “did not independently provide for a power of 
sale.”  Malabe, SDO at 3  (second emphasis added) (brackets , 
quotation marks, and footnote omitted) .  The ICA explained it 
had applied this holding in the context of apartment owner 
associations in Sakal , 143 Hawaiʻi at 225, 426 P.3d at 449, in 
which it held HRS § 667 -5 “merely authorized a sale where such a 
power is independently provided by an agreement between the 
parties.”  Malabe, SDO at 4 (brackets and quotation marks 
omitted).  The ICA observed “the AOAO did not argue that it had 
a power of sale under a mortgage or pursuant to its bylaws or 
some other agreement containing a power of sale. ”  Id.   
Further, the ICA rejected the AOAO ’s argument that       
HRS § 514B-146 authorized the AOAO to conduct a nonjudicial 
foreclosure on the Apartment 
pursuant to HRS § 667- 5.  Malabe, 
SDO at 5.  The ICA reasoned  that based on  its plain language and 
legislative intent, HRS § 667-5 “did not grant a power of sale 
but merely authorized use of certain nonjudicial procedures  in 
order to effect a foreclosure only when a power of sale was ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
13 
 contained in mortgage. ”  Id. (internal quotation marks and 
brackets omitted).  “[T]he phrase ‘in like manner as a mortgage 
of real property ’ [contained in HRS §514B -146(a)] was intended 
to clarify that associations could avail themselves of less 
burdensome procedures, but was not a grant of heretofore non-
existent statutory powers of sale. ”  Malabe, SDO at 6 (footnote 
omitted) (citing Sakal, 143 Hawai ʻi at 227, 426 P.3d at 451).  
The ICA concluded that without a clear legislative act granting 
the “power to extrajudicially sell another person ’s property, ” 
it would not infer that one existed, and therefore the Malabes 
“stated a cognizable claim for wrongful foreclosure against the 
AOAO for which some relief may be granted. ”  Id.  
With respect to the circuit court ’s dismissal of Count II, 
the UDAP claim, the ICA affirmed.  The ICA concluded that this 
claim was barred pursuant to the plain language of            
HRS § 480-24(a)14 governing UDAP claims, which provides, “[a]ny 
action to enforce a cause of action arising under this chapter 
shall be barred unless commenced within four years after the 
cause of action accrues. ”  Malabe, SDO at 8  (alteration in 
original).  Citing to federal case law that “a cause of action 
for unlawful business practices accrues upon occurrence of 
alleged violation, rather than when plaintiff discovers the 
violation[,]”  the ICA concluded the Malabes ’ cause of action 
                         
14  See supra note 12. ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***

 accrued on or about December 17, 2010
, when the AOAO 
“‘collect[ed] [the]  debt,’ i.e., conducted the foreclosure sale 
and submitted the winning bid to purchase the Apartment. ”  
Malabe, SDO at 8 (alterations in original) (citing McDevitt v. 
Guenther, 522 F. Supp. 2d 1272, 1289 (D. 
Haw. 2007); Kersh v. 
Manulife Fin. Corp., 792 F. Supp. 2d 111
1, 1122 (D. Haw.  2011); 
Heejoon Chung v. U.S. Bank, N.A., 250 F. Supp. 3d 658, 671 –73 
(D. Haw. 2017)).  The ICA concluded the Malabes ’ UDAP claim was 
therefore time-barred by HRS § 480-24 because they  filed their 
complaint on December 13, 2016, nearly six years after the 
public sale and outside the limitations period.  See  Malabe, SDO
at 8.  
In addition, the ICA concluded that equitable tolling did 
not apply to the Malabes ’ claims.  The Malabes had argued that 
the AOAO fraudulently concealed their cause of action because it  
had relied on HRS § 667- 5 to conduct the public sale, i.e., 
because the AOAO implied, stated,  and/or misrepresented that it 
was authorized to use HS § 667-5 and/or that it held a mortgage 
with a power of sale when it  did not.  Malabe, SDO at 9.  The 
ICA rejected this argument, reasoning the AOAO ’s mere reliance 
on HRS § 667-5 did not constitute fraudulent concealment: 
As alleged in the Complaint, the AOAO “published notice 
that they would sell the Apartment at a public sale 
pursuant to Section 667 -5.”  The Malabes cite no authority 
for the proposition that reliance on a statutory authority, 
even if that reliance later proves to be wrong, constitutes 
fraudulent concealment, and we find none.  The Complaint ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
15 
 contains no allegations t
hat the AOAO concealed or 
misrepresented its use of HRS § 667 -5.  We decline to 
characterize the Malabes ’ later-developed, but cognizable 
and ultimately successful, legal theory as stating a claim 
for fraudulent concealment by the AOAO at the time the AOAO  
relied on HRS § 667 -5.  Therefore, we conclude that the 
Malabes failed to allege fraudulent concealment sufficient 
to state a claim to equitable tolling of the statute of 
limitations on their UDAP claim.  
 
Malabe, SDO at 9-10. 
 Thus , the ICA vacated  in part the circuit court ’s February 
17, 2017 judgment with respect to its dismissal of Count I, 
affirmed in part with respect to the circuit court ’s dismissal 
of Count II, and remanded the case to the circuit court for 
further proceedings.  
See Malabe, S DO at 10. 
C. Applications for w rits of certiorari  
The AOAO  filed an  application for certiorari, presenting 
six questions: 
[1]. Did the ICA commit grave errors of law and fact when 
they analyzed a nonprofit AOAO ’s participation in a non -
judicial foreclosure, the same as a for -profit financial 
institution ’s participation in a non -judicial foreclosure?  
 
[
2]. Did the ICA commit grave errors of law and fact when 
they analyzed a for -profit financial institution ’s 
foreclosure of its contractual  mortgage, and applied the 
same analysis to that of the nonprofit AOAO ’s foreclosure 
of its statutory lien? 
 
[3]. Did the ICA commit grave errors of law and fact by 
applying a negotiated contractual “power of sale ” analysis, 
arising in the for -profit consumer context, to the 
nonprofit AOAO, who conducts a statutory lien foreclosure 
in accordance with the authority created by and the 
instructions contained in HRS § 514B -146 as provided by the 
[sic] Hawaii ’s legislature?  
 
[4]. Did the ICA commit grave errors  of law and fact by 
holding that the AOAO lacked authority to conduct a non -
judicial foreclosure absent an express written power of 
sale despite the plain language of HRS § 514B -10 providing 
that “the remedies provided by this chapter shall be 
liberally administered . . . . ” and HRS § 514B -146, ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
16 
 providing that “[a]ll sums assessed by the association but 
unpaid for the share of the common expenses chargeable to 
any unit shall constitute a lien on the unit[,] ” and that 
“[t]he lien of the association may be for
eclosed by action 
or by nonjudicial or power of sale foreclosure procedures 
set forth in chapter 667 ”? 
 
[5]. Did the ICA commit grave errors of law and fact in 
holding that Respondents had stated a cognizable claim for 
wrongful foreclosure against the AOAO, based on the 2010 
non-judicial foreclosure sale of the unit owned by 
Respondents?  
 
[6]. Did the ICA commit grave errors of law and fact in 
light of S.B. 551, which has passed two committees in the 
Senate and one committee in this House of Representatives, 
recognizing that “this Act confirms the legislative intent 
that associations should be able to use nonjudicial 
foreclosure to collect delinquencies without having 
specific authority to conduct nonjudicial foreclosures in 
an agreement with a delinquent owner or in the 
association ’s declaration or bylaws . . . . ”? 
 
(Ellipses and some alterations in original.) 
 The first five questions raise issues addressed by the 
circuit court and the ICA.  The sixth question was based on  
Senate Bill 551, which was then pending before the legislature.   
As discussed below, we ordered supplemental briefing regarding 
Act 282. 
The Malabes also filed an application for certiorari, 
presenting two questions: 
1. Whether the ICA gravely erred in holding that 
Petitioners ’ claim for unfair or deceptive acts or 
practices (hereafter “UDAP”) is time
-barred under        
HRS §480 -24, by applying the occurrence rule rather than 
the discovery rule.  
 
2.
 Whether the ICA gravely erred in holding that 
Petitioners failed to allege fraudulent concealment 
sufficient to state a claim of equitable tolling of the 
statute of limitations on their UDAP claim.

17 III. Standards  of review
A. Motions to dismiss
A complaint should not be dismissed for failure to  
state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the 
plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of  [their][]
claim that would entitle them to relief.   We must therefore
view a plaintiff ’s complaint in a light most favorable to 
[them] in order to determine whether the allegations 
contained therein could warrant relief under any 
alternative theory.   For this reason, in reviewing a 
circuit court ’s order dismissing a complaint  . . . our 
consideration is strictly limited to the allegations of the 
complaint, and we must deem those allegations to be true.  15

reviewable de novo.’”  Citizens Against Reckless Dev. v. Zoning 
Bd. of Appeals, 114 Hawai ʻi 184, 193, 159 P.3d 143, 152 (2007) . 
When construing statutes, the court is governed by the following 
rules: 
First, the fundamental starting point for statutory 
interpretation is the language of the statute itself. 
Second, where the statutory language is plain and 
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain 
and obvious meaning.   Third, implicit in the task of 
statutory construction is our foremost obligation to 
ascertain and give effect to the intention of the 
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the 
language contained in the statute itself.  Fourth, when 
there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness 
or uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, an 
ambiguity exists.  
When there is ambiguity in a statute, “the meaning of 
the ambiguous words may be sought by examining the context, 
with which the ambiguous words, phrases, and sentences may 
be compared, in order to ascertain their true meaning. ”

 Moreover, the courts may resort to extrinsic aids in 
determining 
legislative intent, such as legislative history, 
or the reason and spirit of the law.

IV.  Discussion  
A. As the AOAO did not have a power of sale to conduct a 
 nonjudicial foreclosure, the Malabes have stated a 
 wrongful foreclosure claim 
  
 The first five questions in the AOAO ’s application can be 
crystallized as asking whether the Malabes have stated a 
wrongful foreclosure claim 
on the grounds the AOAO did not have 
authority to conduct a nonjudicial foreclose, which it purported 
to conduct pursuant to authority granted by HRS § 667- 5, because 
it lacked a power of sale.  The ICA concluded the Malabes have 
stated a wrongful foreclosure claim, relying on its decision in 
Sakal to explain that HRS § 514B- 146(a) did not “authorize an 
association to conduct a nonjudicial or power of sale 
foreclosure other than as provided in HRS chapter 667, which in 
turn does not authorize a nonjudicial power of sale foreclosure 
absent an otherwise existing power of sale. ”  Sakal, 143 Hawai ʻi 
at 228, 426 P.3d at 452.  
 As stated by the ICA in Sakal, that case presented  
difficult and consequential questions concerning whether an 
association of apartment owners must have a power of sale 
over its units in order to foreclose on a lien against a 
unit through the nonjudicial power of sale foreclosure 
procedures set forth in [HRS Chapter 667].  After an 
exhaustive review, we have concluded that over a number of 
years the Legislature has worked to craft workable, 
nonjudicial foreclosure  procedures, available to 
associations as well as lenders, but at no point did the ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
19 
 Legislature 
take up the issue of whether to enact a blanket 
grant of powers of sale over all condominiumized properties 
in Hawai ʻi.  Accordingly, we conclude that a power of sale 
in favor of a foreclosing association must otherwise exist, 
in the association ’s bylaws or another enforceable 
agreement with its unit owners, in order for the 
association to avail itself of the nonjudicial power of 
sale foreclosure procedures  set forth in [HRS Chapter 
667].
    
 
143 Hawai ʻi at 22
0-21, 426 P.3d at 444- 45.  We do not repeat the
entire analysis of the ICA’ s opinion.  In summary, however, the
ICA held in Sakal that because no statutory power of sale 
existed, for an association to avail itself of the nonjudicial 
power of sale foreclosure procedures set forth in HRS C hapter 
667, a power of sale in favor of a foreclosing association must
otherwise exist in the association ’s bylaws or another 
enforceable agreement with its unit owners.    
 
 
 The AOAO does not argue that any written document provided 
it with a power of sale.  Rather, it argues that it had a 
statutory power of sale.
  In other words, th e AOAO challenges 
the ICA’s ruling in Sakal that the legislature did not by 
statute grant to apartment associations a power of sale to 
nonjudicially foreclose on liens against apar tment owners 
delinquent in paying their share of common expenses.   
 We hold the ICA did not err in reinstating Count I, the 
Malabes’ wrongful foreclosure claim, for a nonjudicial 
foreclosure sale unauthorized by HRS § 667
-5 based on Sakal. 
Sakal correctly held that in order for an association to utilize 
the nonjudicial power of sale foreclosure procedures set  forth ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
20 
 in HRS Chapter 667, a power of sale in its favor must have 
existed in association bylaws or in another enforceable 
agreement with unit
 owners.  143 Hawai ʻi at 220-21, 426 P.3d 444
-
45.  Therefore, a lthough the AOAO conducted its nonjudicial 
foreclosure of the Malabes’ Apartment in this case pursuant to 
HRS § 667- 5, as compared to Part II of HRS Chapter 667 at issue
in Sakal,  the result is the same.  In addition, as discussed 
below, Act 282 does not affect this holding .  
 1. The AOAO did not have authority to conduct a 
  nonjudicial foreclosure pursuant to HRS § 667- 5 
  
 The AOAO ’s notice to the Malabes stated that it would be 
foreclosing pursuant to HRS § 667 -5 and HRS Chapters 514A and 
514B.  The AOAO lacked a power of sale and was therefore not 
authorized to conduct a nonjudicial foreclosure sale.16   
 As of the date of the Malabes ’ nonjudicial foreclosure,  
HRS § 667-5 provided in relevant part as follows: 
§667-5  Foreclosure under power of sale; notice; affidavit 
after sale.   (a)  When a power of sale is contained in a 
mortgage, and where the mortgagee, the mortgagee ’s 
successor in interest, or any person authorized by the 
power to act in the premises, desires to foreclose under 
power of sale upon breach of a condition of the mortgage, 
the mortgagee, successor, or person shall be represented by 
an attorney who is licensed to practice law in the  State 
and is physically located in the State.   The attorney 
shall: 
 
                         
16  We also note that, after Sakal, and before this opinion, Judge Leslie 
Kobayashi of the United States District Court for the District of Hawaiʻi had 
also ruled that, as a matter of law, an association without a power of sale 
was not authorized to utilize HRS § 667 -5 to conduct a nonjudicial 
foreclosure.  Galima v. Ass ’n of Apartment Owners of Palm Court, CIVIL 16 -
00024 LEK- KSC, 2018 WL 6841818 (D. Haw. Dec. 31, 2018).  ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
21 (continued. . .)  
  
    (1)  Give notice of the mortgagee ’s, successor ’s, or  
     person’ s intention to foreclose the       
     mortgage
 . . . ; and 
     (2)  Give any notices and do all acts as are  
 
     authorized or required by the power contained in  
     the mortgage.  
 
(Emphasis added.) 
 “First, the fundamental starting point for statutory 
interpretation is the language of the statute itself. Second, 
where the statutory language is plain and unambiguous, our sole 
duty is to give effect to its plain and obvious meaning. ”  
Citizens Against Reckless Dev., 114 Hawaiʻ i at 193, 159 P.3d at 
152.  The language of the statute and its plain and obvious 
meaning is that HRS § 667 -5 allowed for a nonjudicial 
foreclosure when a power of sale is contained in a mortgage.
The AOAO did not have a mortgage on the Malabes ’ Apartment. 
Thus, the AOAO could not conduct a nonjudicial foreclosure 
pursuant to HRS § 667-5.  17  
 
 2. HRS § 514B- 146 did not provide the AOAO with   
  the  power of sale required to conduct a    
  nonjudicial foreclosure    
 
 The AOAO ’s notice of nonjudicial foreclosure also cited to 
HRS Chapters 514A and 514B as authority for its action.18 
                         
17  The concurrence and dissent agrees that the AOAO in this case was not 
authorized to conduct a nonjudicial foreclosure sale pursuant to HRS § 667 -5. 
  
18  As noted by the ICA in Sakal, HRS Chapter 514A applied to all 
condominiums created before July 1, 2006, except as provided in  sections 
514B-22 and 514B-23, and with other inapplicable exceptions .  143 Hawai ʻi at 
226, 426 P.3d at 450.  HRS Chapter 514B applies to all condominiums created 
after July 1, 2006, pursuant to  HRS § 514B -21 (2006), and HRS § 514B- 22  ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
22 
 Specifically, the 
AOAO argues that HRS § 514B- 146(a), which is 
identical to the former HRS § 514A- 90(a) that governed 
condominiums built before July 1, 2006 until January 1, 2019, 
when HRS Chapter 514B became applicable to all condominiums,19 
authorized it to use the nonjudicial foreclosure procedures set 
forth in HRS § 667- 5.20  As of the date of the AOAO ’s nonjudicial 
foreclosure of the Malabes ’ Apartment, HRS § 514B- 146(a) 
provided in relevant part as follows:  
 [§514B-146
]  Association fiscal matters; lien for 
assessments.  . . . .  (a)  All sums assessed by the 
association but unpaid for the share of the common expenses 
chargeable to any unit shall constitute a lien on the unit 
with priority over all other liens, except:  
     (1)  Liens for taxes and assessments lawfully imposed 
by governmental authority against the unit; and  
                                                                               
(. . .continued)  
provides  that certain enumerated provisions in HRS Chapter 
514B, including  HRS § 514B- 146, apply to all condominiums 
created before July 1, 2006, but “only with respect to 
events and circumstances occurring on or after July 1, 
2006,” provided that their application does not “invalidate 
existing provisions of the declaration, bylaws .  . . or be 
an unreasonable impairment of contract.”   HRS § 514B-
22 (2006).   
 
Id. (ellipsis in original).  
 
 HRS § 514B -22 was repealed by 2017 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 181, § 4, 
effective January 1, 2019, and on January 1, 2019, HRS Chapter 514A was 
repealed and HRS Chapter 514B now applies to all condominiums in Hawai ʻi 
regardless of their creation date, “provided that such application shall not 
invalidate existing provisions of the declaration, bylaws, condominium map, 
or other constituent documents of those condominiums if to do so would 
invalidate the reserved rights of a developer. ”  143 Hawai ʻi at 226, n.12, 426 
P.3d at 450, n.12 (quoting HRS § 514B -21 (Supp. 2017) ).   
 
19  See supra note 18. 
 
20  In her December 31, 2018 Galima  decision, supra  note 16, Judge 
Kobayashi also rejected this argument.  2018 WL 6841818, at *9.  ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
23   
   
   (2) 
 All sums unpaid on any mortgage of record that 
was recorded prior to the recordation of a notice of a lien 
by the association, and costs and expenses including 
attorneys ’ fees provided in such  mortgages.  
 The lien of the association may be foreclosed by 
action or by nonjudicial or power of sale foreclosure 
procedures set forth in chapter 667, by the managing agent 
or board, acting on behalf of the association, in like 
manner as a mortgage of real property.  
  
(Emphases added.)  The AOAO argues that, pursuant to this 
language, it was authorized to conduct a nonjudicial foreclosure 
pursuant to HRS § 667
-5.   
 As noted by the ICA in Sakal, however, HRS § 514B -146(a), 
which was identical to HRS § 514A -90(a), only provided 
associations with access to nonjudicial power of sale 
procedures, and “associations were not being granted heretofore 
non-existent statutory powers of sale[.] ”  Sakal, 143 Hawai ʻi at 
227, 426 P.3d at 451.  The text of HRS §§ 514A-90(a) and/or 
514B-146(a)  refers to an association ’s ability to conduct a 
nonjudicial foreclosure in the context of the “procedures  set 
forth in chapter 667 . . . in like manner as a mortgage of real 
property.”  HRS § 541A-90(a) (emphasis added); HRS § 514B-146(a) 
(emphasis added).  There is no g rant of a  power of sale in 
either statute.  And as we held in Santiago , “no state statute[,  
including Part II of HRS C hapter 667,] creates a right in 
mortgagees to proceed by non-judicial foreclosure; the right is 
created by contract. ”  137 Hawaiʻi at 155, 366 P.3d at 630 
(emphasis added).    ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
24 (continued. . .)  
  As explained by the ICA in Sakal , HRS § 514A- 90(a) was 
amended in 1999 to the version of HRS 514B -146(a) quoted above.  
143 Hawaiʻ i at 22
6, 426 P.3d at 450.  A lthough from 1999, 
pursuant to HRS §§ 514A-90(a) and 514B- 146(a), associations 
could avail themselves of HRS C hapter 667 nonjudicial or power 
of sale procedures, like mortgagees, it is clear that mortgagees 
could conduct a nonjudicial power of sale only if the subject 
mortgage contained a power of sale.  143 Hawaiʻi at 227, 426 P.3d 
at 451 (citing HRS § 667-5 ; Part II of HRS Chapter 667;  Lee, 121 
Hawaiʻi at 292, 218 P.3d at 780  (“no state statute creates a 
right in mortgagees to proceed by non- judicial foreclosure; the 
right is created by contract ”)). 
 Thus, as noted by the ICA: 
The 1999 amendment to  HRS § 514 A-90 did not purport to 
enact a blanket grant of powers of sale to all associations 
over all apartments/units within those associations.  There 
is nothing in the legislative history of Act 236 of 1999 to 
suggest that a grant of powers of sale was even 
contemplated.  The text of Act 236 of 1999 specifically 
states that this amendment was intended to  clarify that 
associations could avail themselves of less 
burdensome  procedures, i.e., the alternative power of sale 
foreclosure procedures enacted the prior year.  See 1999 
Haw. Sess. Laws Act 236, § 1 at 723 -24.  As stated earlier, 
we will not infer that the  power to extrajudicially sell 
another person ’s property was granted, in the absence of a 
clear legislative act doing so.[21]   
                         
21  As held by Sakal , the legislature ’s 2012 amendments to the foreclosure 
law also did not create a power of sale  for associations .  143 Hawaiʻ i at 225, 
426 P.3d at 449.  The  2012 amendments were based on recommendation s of a 
legislatively created foreclosure task force.  Legislative Reference Bureau,

the Regular Session of 2012  6 (2011), available at https://lrb.hawaii.gov/wp -

The task force recommendations  included  an amendment to “ chapter 667 []

 Sakal, 143 
Hawaiʻi at 227, 426 P.3d at 451.   
 As further explained  by Sakal , in contrast to the Hawai ʻi 
statutory scheme, other states have included a statutory grant 
of the power of sale explicitly in the language of their  
statutes.  143 Hawaiʻi at 228, 426 P.3d at 452 (citing D.C. Code 
Ann. § 42- 1903.13(c)(1) (West 2017) (“The unit owners ’ 
association shall have the power of sale to enforce a lien for

past due.” (emphasis added.)); Minn. Stat. § 515B.3- 116(h)(1) 
(2017) ( “[T]he association ’s lien may be foreclosed in a like 
manner as a mortgage containing a power of sale pursuant to

legislature.  See generally  2012 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 182.  The 2012 amendment 
to section 514A- 90 did not grant associations a power of sale, but instead 
codified procedures for associations to follow when conducting a nonjudicial

Statutes. . . .  The assoc iation shall be deemed to have a power 
of sale for purposes of enforcement of its claim of lien. ” 
(emphasis added.)) ).22  
 As noted by the ICA, the 
Hawaiʻi legislature did not use 
language similar to that of the above-quoted state codes in 
either HRS Chapter 514A or 514B, nor did the legislative history 
of these chapters provide any indication that the legislature 
provided “a blanket grant of powers of sale to all associations 
over all apartments/units within those associations. ”  Sakal, 
143 Hawaiʻ i at 227, 426 P.3d at 451 .23   
                         
22  As noted in Sakal , these statutes from other states clearly and 
unequivocally provide associations with a power of sale to enforce their 
liens.  143 Hawai ʻi at 228, 426 P.3d at 452.  The dissent asserts that  
HRS § 667- 40 (2016) and HRS § 514B -146(a) constituted similar statutory 
authority for associations to conduct nonjudicial foreclosures under Part II 
of HRS Chapter 667.  HRS § 667 -40, which is within Part II of Chapter 667, 
however, provided that Part II of HRS Chapter 667 procedures can be followed 
if “a law . . . authorizes, permits, or provides for .  . . a power of sale 
foreclosure . . . or a nonjudicial foreclosure. ”  This statute obviously 
requires another law that would allow an association to conduct a nonjudicial 
foreclosure.  The dissent asserts that HRS § 514B-146(a) is that law.  That 
statute, however, provided in 2010 (the time of the AOAO's nonjudicial 
foreclosure of the Malabes’ Apartment) that  “[t]he lien of the association of 
apartment owners may be foreclosed by action or by nonjudicial or power of 
sale foreclosure procedures set forth in chapter 667, by the managing agent 
or board of directors, acting on behalf of the association of apartment 
owners, in like manner  as a mortgage on real property.”  As correctly opined 
by the ICA in Sakal, this statute, unlike those of other states, does not 
provide a “power” of sale.  Id.  
 
23  As explained in supra note 8, Sakal addressed an association’s

case asserted authority to conduct a nonjudicial foreclosure under the more 
simple “process” of HRS § 667 -5.  As further explained in Sakal: 
  
 Part II of HRS chapter 667 was enacted through Act 
122 of 1998, in order to address certain shortcomings 
in HRS § 667 -5 (repealed in 2012).   HRS § 667 -40, which is 
applicable only to time share plans, condominium property 
regimes,  and agreements of sale, remain[ed]  in effect as 
enacted in 1998 (with subsequent amendments), 
notwithstanding the addition of Part VI, as well as Part  
IV, which pertains to the foreclosure of a time share 
interest where a time share interest mortgage, loan, 
agreement, or contract contains a power of sale.  
 
143 Hawaiʻ i at 224 n.8, 426 P.3d at 448 n.8  
 
 Part II of HRS Chapter 667’s “ processes”  include foreclosure notices, 
notices of default, recordation of notices of default, cures of default, 
places of public sale, cancellations of sale, authorized bidders, 
conveyances, distributions of sale proceeds, affidavits after sale, 
recordation of affidavits, and  public notice.  S ee HRS §§ 667-21.5 through 
667-41.  And although HRS § 667- 40 provides that “[a] power of sale 
foreclosure under [Part II  of HRS Chapter 667] may be used in certain non -
mortgage situations where a law or a written document contains, authorizes, 
permits, or provides for a power of sale, a power of sale foreclosure, a 
power of sale remedy, or a nonjudicial foreclosure [,]” by its own language, 
this statute requires that such a “law” or “written document ” otherwise 
exist.  As further noted by the ICA with respect to HRS § 667 -40:   
 
If a law provided powers of sale to all associations, there 
would be no need to reference other written documents; 
however, the language suggests that such a law might exist, 
but we found none.  We note, however, that the nonjudicial 
power of sale procedures in Part II of HRS chapter 667 are 
expressly made available to associations through          
HRS § 667 -40, where such powers exist, but other parts of 
Part II are an ill fit for associations.   See, e.g., 
HRS § 667 -32(a)(1)  (requiring “the foreclosing mortgagee ” 
to file an affidavit under penalty of perjury 
stating,  inter alia,  “that the power of sale foreclosure 
was made pursuant to the power of sale provision in the 
mortgage ”).  Especially in light of other aspects of Part 
II of HRS chapter 667 that cannot be read literally as to 
association foreclosures, we conclude that the ambiguous 
references to “a law or written document ” is too thin a 
reed on which to support a statutory power of sale.  
Nevertheless, we delved further into the history of 
statutory lien rights of associations, from when they were 
first enacted as part of the first Horizontal Property Act 
in 1961, when they were amended in 1963, and through the 
present.   See 1961 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 180, § 15 at 276; 
1963 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 101, § 22 at 88; HRS § 514 -24(a) 
(1968) (repealed in 1977);  HRS §§ 514A- 90 and 514B-146.

  For all of these reasons, and for the additional reasons 
contained in the ICA opinion, we hold that Sakal was correctly 
decided.24

24  We also adopt the ICA’s analysis of relevant l egislative history.  
Sakal, 143 Hawai ʻi at 223 -28, 426 P.3d at 448 -53.  We further address an 
assertion not addressed by the ICA’s Sakal opinion.  The dissent states:  
 
[T]he differences between a nonjudicial and a judicial 
foreclosure, and the advantages that the former confers, 
are procedural:  
 
[A foreclosure pursuant to HRS §  667-5 (Supp. 
2010)] is relatively quick and inexpensive.  It 
does not require a lengthy time period between 
the notice of default and foreclosure sale, and 
does not require court costs and legal fees 
associated with discovery and drafting of 
pleadings. 
 
Lee, 121 Hawaiʻi at 292, 218 P.3d at  780 (quoting Georgine 
W. Kwan, Mortgagor Protection Laws: A Proposal for Mortgage 
Foreclosure Reform in Hawaiʻi, 24 U. Haw. L. Rev. 245, 253 
(2011)); see also  Restatement (Third) of Property: 
Mortgages § 8.2 (Am. Law Inst. 2020) (“The underlying 
theory of power of sale foreclosure is that by complying 
with the statutory requirements, the mortgagee accomplishes 
the same purposes achieved by judicial foreclosure without 
the substantial additional burdens that the latter type of 
foreclosure entails.”).  
 
(Second alteration in original.)  
 
 The “underlying theory” stated above does not comport with reality; the 
differences between nonjudicial foreclosures pursuant to HRS § 667 -5, at 
issue in this case, as well as Part II of HRS Chapter 667 at issue in Sakal, 
and judicial foreclosures are not merely “procedural,” as posited by the 
dissent.  The Malabes not only lost their home; they were left with liability 
on the mortgage they had procured to buy their home.  AOAOs that have 
conducted nonjudicial foreclosures have been able to obtain title to 
condominium units for much less than fair market value, while leaving the 
homeowner responsible for the mortgage.  Although judicial foreclosures may 
take longer and require more expense, they are conducted under the ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***

  3. Other arguments do not support a conclusion that 
  the AOAO had a power of sale  
 
 In its amicus brief, the Hawaii Council of Associations of 
Apartment Owners d.b.a. Hawaii Council of Community Associations 
(“Council”) raises additional arguments in support of the AOAO.     
 The Council submits  that an interpretation of Hawai ʻi’s
 
condominium laws “must be imaginative and progressive rather 
than restrictive[ ,]” quoting  State Savings and Loan Ass’n v. 
Kauaian Dev elopment Co., 50 Haw. 540, 552, 445 P.2d 109, 118- 19 
                                                                               
(. . .continued)  
supervision of a judge who recognizes that “[m]ortgage foreclosure is a 
proceeding equitable in nature and is thus governed by the rules of equity.”  
HawaiiUSA Fed. Credit Union v. Monalim, No. SCWC- 16-0000807, at 18, 2020 WL 
2079890 (Haw. April 30, 2020).  Thus, although a judicial foreclosure can 
also result in continuing mortgage liability, a judge has discretion to 
disallow association foreclosure and instead require an owner to pay the 
amount owed an association to avoid forfeiture of equity along with 
continuing mortgage liability, and can suggest methods of obtaining such 
funds.  And in nonjudicial foreclosures, homeowners might lose the benefit of 
our holding in Monalim, which adopted the majority rule and held that 
“equitable consid erations of foreclosure proceedings warrant affording 
mortgagees the right to apply the fair market value of mortgaged property 
towards the amount due on the mortgage [.]”  Id. at 49.   
 Also, the dissent’s citation to HRS § 667 -92 (2016)’s disallowance of 
association deficiency judgments in certain situations is inapposite, as that 
statute is within Part VI of HRS Chapter 667  and only applies to foreclosures 
conducted pursuant to that part.  HRS § 667 -92(a) (“When a unit owner has 
failed to pay an assessment, and when the association intends to conduct a 
power of sale foreclosure under this part . . . .”).  Also, even before Act 
282, if an association had attempted to proceed with a nonjudicial 
foreclosure under Part VI without court approval, the owner had a one year 
right of redemption to reobtain the unit by paying the delinquency owed.   
HRS § 667- 92(f)(2).  In addition, before Act 282, Part VI contained numerous 
other protections for owners, such as the right to submit a payment plan 
that, if reasonable,  could not be rejected by the association, as well as a 
sixty day right of cure.  HRS § 667 -92(c).  According to the Malabes’ 
complaint, there were only 18 days between the AOAO's December 17, 2010 
notice of publication of sale and the January 4, 2011 quitclaim deed the AOAO 
executed with itself as grantor and grantee, through which the Malabes lost 
title.  This obviously never could have happened in a judicial foreclosure, 
as an owner would have had twenty days after service of a foreclosure 
complaint to respond.  See HRCP Rule 12(a).  Thus, the differences between 
nonjudicial foreclosures in Parts I and II of HRS  Chapter 667  and judicial 
foreclosures are much more than procedural.  ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
30 (continued. . .)  
 (1968).  It asserts that HRS § 514B -146(a) is a “remedial ” 
statute “because [it] provide[s] the remedy of nonjudicial or 
power of sale foreclosures, ” and as such, the remedy provided in 
HRS Chapter 514B is to be “liberally administered ” pursuant to 
HRS § 514B-10 (2006).25   
 The Malabes argued below that the focus of HRS § 514B -10 is 
on an owner who has been harmed by a violation of any provision 
of HRS Chapter 514B, but based on its plain language,  
HRS § 514B-10 applies to any “aggrieved party. ”  For the reasons 
explained above, however, the “remedy” sought by the AOAO and 
the Council simply do not exist as a matter of law.26     
                         
25  HRS § 514B -10 provides: 
 
 §514B-10  Remedies to be liberally administered.  
(a)  The remedies provided by this chapter shall be 
liberally administered to the end that the aggrieved party 
is put in as good a position as if the other party had 
fully performed.   Punitive damages may not be awarded, 
howe
ver, except as specifically provided in this chapter or 
by other rule of law.  
   
  (b)  Any deed, declaration, bylaw, or condominium map 
shall be liberally construed to facilitate the operation of 
the condominium property regime.  
     (c)  Any right or obligation declared by this chapter 
is enforceable by judicial proceeding.  . . . 
 
 The Council also argues that HRS §§ 514A -90 and 514A -82(b) are remedial 
statutes, but the parties do not refer to HRS § 514A -90 or HRS § 514A- 82(b) 
as bases for the AOAO ’s foreclosure upon the Apartment.  These sections were 
repealed in 2004.  
 
26  Chapter 514B does contain some r emedies for owners  that could have been 
implicated in this context of the assertions in the Malabes’ complaint .  The 
AOAO in this case does not argue that the declaration or the by -laws provided 
a power of sale for any non -payment of association  fees or assessment .  Thus, 
owners may not have known that their associations would later pursue 
nonjudicial foreclosures pursuant to HRS § 667 -5 for non -payment of 
association fees.   Owners could therefore have been denied possible remedies 
under Chapter 514B i f they were not provided notice that if they fail ed to ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***

The Council also asserts the ICA ’s failure to address    
HRS § 514A-82(b)(13) constitutes grave error.  The Council 
argues that this statute specifically incorporated
 into the 
bylaws of all condominium projects existing as of January 1, 
1988, and all condominium projects created after that date the 
provision that “[a] lien created pursuant to section 514A- 90 may 
be enforced by the association in any manner permitted by law, 
including nonjudicial or power of sale foreclosure procedures 
authorized by chapter 667. ”  HRS § 514A -82(b)(13) (repealed 
2004).  Thus, according to the Council, HRS § 514A- 82(b)(13) 
provides the authority to an association to foreclose pursuant 
to Part I of HRS Chapter 667.    
 HRS § 514A -82(b)(13), added by Act 236 of 1999,  is within 
Part V of Chapter 514A governing “Condominium Management .”  The 
provision states that an association ’s bylaws “shall be 
consistent with the following provisions: . . . (13) A lien 
created pursuant to section 514A-90 may be enforced b y the 
                                                                               
(. . .continued)  
pay fees or assessments due their  association, the association could utilize 
the expedited nonjudicial foreclosure process of HRS § 667 -5.  Without being 
informed of that possibility, owners could then lose their homes and  any 
equity therein, and end up with liability on their mortgages.  They would 
thus be deprived of “likely [] the largest ‘investment ’ a person in Hawai ʻi 
may make in a lifetime[,] ” Cieri v. Leticia Query Realty, Inc., 80 
Hawaiʻi 54, 
67, 905 P.2d 29, 42 (1995), which is in their home.  Under these 
circumstances, owners may have been deprived of statutory remedies  of a 
buyer’s thirty- day right to cancel pursuant to HRS § 514B -86 (2006) after 
reviewing the declaration and bylaws, or of an owner’ s right to require 
compliance with the by -law amendment process of HRS § 514B -108 (2006), should 
the association have sought to amend its by -laws to allow nonjudicial 
foreclosures.      ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
32 
 association in any manner permitted by law, including 
nonjudicial or power of sale foreclosure procedures authorized 
by chapter 667[.] ”  The statute did not, however, create a power 
of sale; rather, it stated that the lien “may be enforced ” “by 
nonjudicial or power of sale procedures authorized by chapter 
667” where “ permitted by law. ”  This ends up being a circular 
argument, as a nonjudicial foreclosure was not “permitted by 
law” for the reasons explained above. 
 The Council also argues that HRS §§ 514A-82(b)(13),    
514A-90, and 514B-146 use language similar to an ordinance  that 
authorizes the County of Honolulu Honolulu to conduct 
nonjudicial foreclosure on real property tax liens.  The Council 
asserts the legislature therefore must have granted associations 
authority to conduct nonjudicial foreclosures.   The Counc il 
compares the language used in HRS §§  514A-82 and 514A- 90 to the 
language of the Revised Ordinances of Honolulu ( “ROH”) § 8-5.2 
(1983).  It argues that the phrase “may be sold by way of 
foreclosure without suit ” in ROH §  8-5.2 authorizes nonjudicial 
foreclosures, and that the similar language in HRS Chapter 514A 
likewise authorizes the use of nonjudicial foreclosures.   
 
ROH § 8-5.2 provides in relevant part: 
 All real property on which a lien for taxes exists 
may be sold by way of foreclosure without suit by the 
director, and in case any lien, or any part thereof, has 
existed thereon for three years, shall be sold by the 
director at public auction to the highest bidder, for cash, 
to satisfy the lien[.] ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
33 
  We could find no appellate cases citing this ordinance.  
HRS §§ 514A-82 and 514A-90 provide, however, that associations 
may enforce liens by using “nonjudicial or power of sale 
foreclosure procedures authorized by chapter 667 ” and 
“nonjudicial or power of sale foreclosure procedures set forth 
in chapter 667[.] ”  (Emphasis added.)  Thus, the language of  
ROH § 8-5.2 is not analogous to the language of HRS §§ 514A-82 
and 514A-90.   
 In summary, Sakal was correctly decided.  Thus , the ICA did 
not err in reinstating Count I, the Malabes ’ wrongful 
foreclosure claim , based on its decision in Sakal.   
 4. Act 282 of 2019 does not impact the nonjudicial   
  foreclosure conducted by the AOAO on the Malabes ’  
  Apartment 
 
 As noted earlier, Act 282 came into effect on 
July 10, 
2019.   We therefore ordered supplemental briefing on the 
following issue: “What effect, if any, does SB551, CD1 of 2019
have on this case? ”     2827
 
We hold that the statutory changes in Act 282 do not affect 
the Malabes’ wrongful foreclosure claim against the AOAO, which 
conducted its foreclosure pursuant to Part I of HRS Chapter 667.  
                         
27  See supra note 3. 
 
28  Pursuant to Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure ( “HRAP”) Rule 44 
(2016), the Malabes notified Attorney General Clare E. Connors that they 
challenged the constitutionality of Act 282.  The Attorney General did not 
file a brief or indicate she wished  to appear in this matter.  ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
34 
 For this reason, we need not address the constitutionality of 
Act 282 with respect to Part VI of Chapter 667.
  We also discuss, 
however, the United States District Court ’s ruling in Ga lima.29  
  a. Act 282   
Act 282 states in its entirety:  
 SECTION 1.  The legislature finds that “Hawaii was 
the first state to enact statutory provisions enabling the 
creation of condominiums. ”  State Savings & Loan 
Association v. Kauaian Development Company, 50 Haw. 540, 
546, 445 P.2d 109, 115 n.8 (1968).   Brought into being by 
the legislature through Act 180, Session Laws of Hawaii 
1961, condominiums are “creature[s] of statute, ” State 
Savings & Loan Association , 50 Haw. at 546, 445 P.2d at 115, 
which are governed by statutes, as well as their governing 
documents.  
     The legislature finds that condominiums provide a 
valuable housing resource in Hawaii, especially with 
limited space available for new development.   The structure 
of condominium ownership requires each owner to share in 
the total cost of maintaining common areas such as building 
exteriors, landscaping, pool, and recreation rooms, in 
addition to paying insurance premiums.   All owners pay for 
such maintenance through fees or dues.   The legislature 
further finds that it is crucial that condominium 
associations be able to secure timely payment of dues to 
provide services to all residents of a condominium 
community.  
     In 1999, the legislature noted “that more frequently 
associations of apartment owners are having to increase 
maintenance fee assessments due to increasing delinquencies 
and related enforcement expenses.   This places an unfair 
burden on those non -delinquent apartment owners who must 
bear an unfair share of common expenses . . . . ”  Moreover, 
lengthy delays in the judicial foreclosure process 
exacerbated the financial burden on association 
owners.  The legislature determined that associations 
needed a more efficient alternative, such as power of sale 
foreclosures, to provide a remedy for  recurring 
delinquencies.  
     Additionally, the legislature finds that condominium 
associations, since 1999, have been authorized to conduct 
nonjudicial foreclosures regardless of the presence or the 
absence of power of sale language in an association ’s 
governing documents.   Beginning in 1998 with the passage of 
Act 122, Session Laws of Hawaii 1998, and codified in 
                         
29  Like the Malabes, the Galima plaintiffs’ condominium had been sold 
through a nonjudicial foreclosure conducted pursuant to Part I of Chapter 
667.   ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
35 
 section 667 -40, Hawaii Revised Statutes, condominium 
associations were authorized to conduct nonjudicial 
foreclosures if a “law or written docu
ment contains, 
authorizes, permits, or provides for a power of sale, a 
power of sale foreclosure, a power of sale remedy, or a 
nonjudicial foreclosure. ”  However, in 1999, the 
legislature passed Act 236, Session Laws of Hawaii 1999, 
“[c]larify[ing] that associations of apartment owners may 
enforce liens for unpaid common expenses by non -judicial 
power of sale foreclosure procedures, as an alternative to 
legal action ” by: 
 
    (1)  Specifying that condominium associations may  
     foreclose liens by nonjudicial or power of sale  
     foreclosure within the statute governing the  
     priority of a condominium association lien      
     (section 514A -90, Hawaii Revised Statutes     
     (repealed January 1, 2019)); and  
     (2)  Incorporating into the bylaws of all condominium   
     associations a provision authorizing condominium     
     associations to enforce liens by nonjudicial or power  
     of sale foreclosure pursuant to chapter 667, Hawaii  
     Revised Statutes (section 514A -82, Hawaii Revised  
     Statutes (repealed January 1, 2019)).  
 Thus, Act 236, Session Laws of Hawaii 1999, provided 
a statutory grant of power and an incorporation into 
written documents authorizing condominium associations to 
utilize nonjudicial foreclosure under sections 66 7-5 
(repealed June 28, 2012) and 667 -40, Hawaii Revised 
Statutes, to enforce their liens.  
     The legislature also finds that this intent was not 
abrogated by the recodification of chapter 514A, Hawaii 
Revised Statutes.   First, through Act 164, Session Laws of 
Hawaii 2004, the language of section 514A -90, Hawaii 
Revised Statutes, was incorporated with limited amendments 
while retaining the authorization that condominium 
associations may foreclose liens by nonjudicial or power of 
sale foreclosure.   Second, while the new statute governing 
bylaws no longer contained a provision authorizing 
condominium associations to enforce liens by nonjudicial or 
power of sale foreclosure, it was not removed out of an 
intention to revoke this authority from condominium 
associations but rather out of a desire to enhance the 
clarity of the condominium law.   As stated in the  Final 
Report to the Legislature:   Recodification of Chapter 514A, 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (Condominium Property Regimes), the 
“statutory requirements for condominium governing documents 
should be minimized while incorporating certain 
provisions . . . in more appropriate statutory sections. ” 
     Further, the legislature finds that the intent was not 
abrogated by the creation of the nonjudicial foreclosure 
process specifically for condominium associations, codified 
as part VI of chapter 667, Hawaii Revised Statutes, through 
Act 182, Session Laws of Hawaii 2012.   This is evidenced by 
the lack of a provision constricting its application 
similar to the language in  section 667- 40, Hawaii Revised 
Statutes.  ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
36 
  
    Since the enactment of part VI of chapter 667, Hawaii 
Revised Statutes, associations have conducted nonjudicial 
foreclosures as part of their efforts to collect 
delinquencies and sustain their financial 
operations.  Associations have done so subject to the 
restrictions on nonjudicial foreclosures and other 
collection options imposed by the legislature, which 
include:  
 
    (1)  Prohibiting the use of nonjudicial foreclosure to 
     collect fines, penalties, legal fees, or late  
     fees; 
     (2)  Requiring associations to give an owner sixty  
     days to cure a default before proceeding with the 
     nonjudicial foreclosure and to accept reasonable  
     payment plans of up to twelve months; and  
     (3)  Requiring associations to provide owners with  
     contact information for approved housing     
     counselors and approved budget and credit   
     counselors. 
     However, the intermediate court of appeals in  Sakal v. 
Association of Apartment Owners of Hawaiian Monarch, 143 
Haw. 219, 426 P.3d 443 (2018), held that the legislature 
intended that associations can only conduct nonjudicial 
foreclosures if they have specific authority to conduct 
nonjudicial foreclosures in their declaration or bylaws or 
in an agreement with the owner being foreclosed upon.  
     The legislative history indicates this was not the 
intent of the legislature in 1999, nor in legislatures that 
have made subsequent amendments.   Therefore, this Act  
confirms the legislative intent that condominium 
associations should be able to use nonjudicial foreclosure 
to collect delinquencies regardless of the presence or 
absence of power of sale language in an association ’s 
governing documents.  
     This Act also provides an additional consumer 
protection by requiring the foreclosing association to 
offer mediation with any notice of default and intention to 
foreclose and the procedures when mediation is chosen by 
the consumer.  
     SECTION 2.  Chapter 514B, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is 
amended by adding a new section to be appropriately 
designated and to read as follows:  
     ”§514B-    Association fiscal matters; supplemental 
nonjudicial foreclosure notices; restrictions on power of 
sale.  (a)  Any notice of default and intention to 
foreclose given by an association under section 667 -92(a) 
shall, in addition to the requirements of that section, 
also include a statement that the unit owner may request 
mediation by delivering a written request for mediation to 
the association by certified mail, return receipt requested, 
or hand delivery within thirty days after service of a 
notice of default and intention to foreclose on the unit 
owner. 
     If the association does not receive a request for 
mediation within the thirty- day period, the association may 
proceed with nonjudicial or power of sale foreclosure, 
subject to all applicable provisions of this chapter and ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
37 
 chapter 667.   If the association receives a request for 
mediation, as set forth in this subsection, from a unit 
owner within thirty days after service of a notice of 
default and intention to foreclose upon the unit owner, the 
association shall agree to mediate and shall be prohibited 
from proceeding with nonjudicial or power of sale 
foreclosure until the association has participated in the 
mediation or the time period for completion of the 
mediation has elapsed.   The mediation shall be completed 
within sixty days of the date upon which the unit owner 
delivers a request for mediation upon the association; 
provided  that if the mediation is not commenced or 
completed within sixty days or the parties are unable to 
resolve the dispute by mediation, the association may 
proceed with nonjudicial or power of sale foreclosure, 
subject to all applicable provisions of this chapter and 
chapter 667.  
     (b)  In addition to the wording required by section 
667-92(b), any notice of default and intention to foreclose 
given by an association under section 667 -92(a) shall also 
contain wording substantially similar to the following in  
all capital letters and printed in not less than fourteen -
point font:  
     “THIS NOTICE PERTAINS TO AMOUNTS DUE AND OWING TO THE 
ASSOCIATION FOR WHICH THE ASSOCIATION HAS A STATUTORY OR 
RECORDED LIEN.   THIS NOTICE DOES NOT PERTAIN TO OBLIGATIONS 
OWED BY YOU TO OTHER CREDITORS, INCLUDING ANY OUTSTANDING 
MORTGAGE DEBT.   YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR OTHER CREDITORS, 
INCLUDING YOUR MORTGAGEES, IF ANY, AS TO THE EFFECT THE 
FORECLOSURE OF THE ASSOCIATION ’S LIEN WILL HAVE ON YOUR 
OTHER OUTSTANDING DEBTS. ” 
     (c)  The association ’s power of sale provided in 
section 514B -146(a) may not be exercised against:  
     (1)  Any lien that arises solely from fines, penalties, 
legal fees, or late fees, and the foreclosure of any such 
lien shall be filed in court pursuant to part  IA of chapter 
667; 
     (2)  Any unit owned by a person who is on military 
deployment outside of the State of Hawaii as a result of 
active duty military status with any branch of the United 
States military.   The foreclosure of any such lien shall be 
filed in court pursuant to part IA of chapter 667, this 
subsection shall not apply if the lien of the association 
has been outstanding for a period of one year or longer; or  
     (3)  Any unit while the nonjudicial or power of sale 
foreclosure has been stayed pursuant to section 667 -92(c).”  
     SECTION 3.  Section 514B -146, Hawaii Revised Statutes, 
is amended by amending subsection (a) to read as follows:  
     “(a)  All sums assessed by the association but unpaid 
for the share of the common expenses chargeable  to any unit 
shall constitute a lien on the unit with priority over all 
other liens, except:  
     (1)  Liens for real property taxes and assessments  
     lawfully imposed by governmental authority     
     against the unit; and  
     (2)  Except as provided in subsection (j), all sums  
     unpaid on any mortgage of record that was     ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
38 
      recorded prior to the recordation of a notice of  
     a lien by the association, and costs and expenses 
     including attorneys ’ fees provided in such  
   
     mortgages; 
provided that a lien recorded by an association for unpaid 
assessments shall expire  six years from the date of 
recordation  unless proceedings to enforce the lien are 
instituted prior to the expiration of the lien; provided 
further that the expiration of a recorded lien shall in no 
way affect the association ’s automatic lien that arises 
pursuant to this subsection or the declaration or 
bylaws.  Any proceedings to enforce an association ’s lien 
for any assessment shall be instituted within six years 
after the assessment became due; provided that if the owner 
of a unit subject to a lien of the association files a 
petition for relief under the United States Bankruptcy Code 
(11 U.S.C. §101  et seq.), the period of time for 
instituting proceedings to enforce the association ’s lien 
shall be tolled until thirty days after the automatic stay 
of proceedings under section 362 of the United States 
Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. §362) is lifted.  
     The lien of the association may be foreclosed by 
action or by nonjudicial  or power of sale foreclosure 
[procedures set forth in chapter 667], regardless of the 
presence or absence of power of sale language in an 
association ’s governing documents,  by the managing agent or 
board, acting on behalf of the association and in the name 
of the association ; provided  that no association may 
exercise the nonjudicial or power of sale remedies provided 
in chapter 667 to foreclose a lien against any unit that 
arises solely from fines, penalties, legal fees, or late 
fees, and the foreclosure of any such lien shall be filed 
in court pursuant to part IA of chapter 667.  
     In any such foreclosure, the unit owner shall be 
required to pay a reasonable rental for the unit, if so 
provided in the bylaws or the law, and the plaintiff in the 
foreclosure shall be entitled to the appointment of a 
receiver to collect the rental owed by the unit owner or 
any tenant of the unit.   If the association is the 
plaintiff, it may request that its managing agent be 
appointed as receiver to collect the rent from the 
tenant.  The managing agent or board, acting on behalf of 
the association and in the name of the association, unless 
prohibited by the declaration, may bid on the unit at 
foreclosure sale, and acquire and hold, lease, mortgage, 
and convey the unit.   Action to recover a money judgment 
for unpaid common expenses shall be maintainable without 
foreclosing or waiving the lien securing the unpaid common 
expenses owed. ” 
     SECTION 4.  Section 667 -1, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is 
amended by amending the definition of “ power of sale ” to 
read as follows:  
     ““Power of sale”  or “power of sale foreclosure ” means 
a nonjudicial foreclosure when [the]: 
     (1)  The mortgage contains, authorizes, permits, or  
     provides for a power of sale, a power of sale  ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
39 
      foreclosure, a power of sale remedy, or a     
     nonjudicial foreclosure[ .]; or 
     (2)  For the purposes of part VI, an association   
     enforces its claim of an association lien,      
     regardless of whether the association documents   
     provide for a power of sale, a power of sale   
     foreclosure, a power of sale remedy, or a      
     nonjudicial foreclosure. ” 
     SECTION 5.  Sections 3 and 4 of this Act shall be 
applied retroactively to any case, action, proceeding, or 
claim arising out of a nonjudicial foreclosure under 
section 667 -5 (repealed June 28, 2012), Hawaii Revised 
Statutes, and parts II and VI of chapter 667, Hawaii 
Revised Statutes, that arose before the effective date of 
this Act and in which a final non -appealable judgment has 
not yet been entered.  
     SECTION 6.  This Act shall not be applied so as to 
impair any contract existing as of the effective date of 
this Act in a manner violative of either the Hawaii State 
Constitution or Article I, section 10, of the United States 
Constitution. 
     SECTION 7.  If any provision of this Act, or the 
application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held 
invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or 
applications of the Act that can be given effect without 
the invalid provision or application, and to this end the 
provisions of this Act are severable.  
     SECTION 8.  Statutory material to be repealed is 
bracketed and stricken.   New statutory material is 
underscored.  
     SECTION 9.  This Act shall take effect upon its 
approval; provided that the amendments made to section 
514B-146(a), Hawaii Revised Statutes, by section 3 of this 
Act shall not be repealed when that section is reenacted on 
June 30, 2020, pursuant to section 6 of Act 195, Session 
Laws of Hawaii 2018.

 Act 282 became law without the Governor ’s signature 
effective July 10, 2019.  2019 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 282, §§ 1 -9, 
at 779-83; 2019 House Journal, at 734-35 (Gov.  Msg. No. 1402 ). 
  b. Malabes ’ supplemental briefing 
 The Malabes primarily argue that “while Act 282 writes into 
an association ’s governing documents an express power of sale, 
it does not (and cannot) create a mortgage containing a power of ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
40 
 sale for the association. ”  The Malabes point out that in its 
preface, Act 282 states “that condominium associations should be 
able to use nonjudicial foreclosure to collect delinquencies 
regardless of the presence or absence of power of sale language 
in an association ’s governing documents[ ,]” and that in Section 
2 of Act 282 (“Section 2”) , HRS § 514B- 146 has been amended to 
state that an association ’s lien “may be foreclosed by action or 
by nonjudicial or power of sale foreclosure, regardless of the 
presence or absence of power of sale language in an 
association’s governing documents. ”   
 The Malabes also argue that Section 4 of Act 282 ’s 
(“Section 4”) amendment to the definition of “power of sale ” or 
“power of sale foreclosure ” does not affect its wrongful 
foreclosure case, as it did not  change the mortgage requirements 
of Part I of HRS Chapter 667 .  Instead, according to the 
Malabes, by definition, Act 282 gives an association the right 
to conduct a nonjudicial foreclosure, either through a mortgage 
giving the association a power of sale, or under Parts  II or VI 
of HRS Chapter 667 with a statutory right to conduct that power 
of sale.  Thus, al though Act 282 states that it shall be 
“applied retroactively to any case, action, proceeding, or claim 
arising out of a nonjudicial foreclosure under section 667- 5 
(repealed June 28, 2012) [in Part I of HRS Chapter 667] . . . 
and parts II and VI of chapter 667 . . . that arose before the ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
41 
 effective date of this Act and in which a final non
-appealable 
judgment has not yet been entered[ ,]” the Malabes argue nothing 
in Act 282 amends HRS § 667- 5 nor alters how that statute should 
be construed.   
 The Malabes further contend that if Act 282 can be 
construed to permit condominium associations to foreclose based 
on Part I of HRS Chapter 667 and the now repealed HRS § 667-5 by 
statutorily conferring a “mortgage that contains a power of 
sale” on the association, Act 282 is unconstitutional as it 
violates (1) the Contracts Clause of the United States 
Constitution, (2) the separation of powers doctrine, (3) the 
Malabes’ rights to due process and equal protection, and (4) the 
Malabes’ rights under the Fifth Amendment to the United States 
Constitution and a rticle 1, section 20 of the Hawai ʻi 
Constitution, which protect them from uncompensated takings.  
Because the United States District Court ruled Act 282 
unconstitutional based only
 on the Contracts Clause, we include 
these parties’  arguments in that regard.  
As to the 
Contracts Clause violation , the Malabes point out 
that it is undisputed that the AOAO does not have a mortgage or 
an agreement containing a power of sale.  If Act 282 is 
interpreted to create a mortgage with a power of sale between 
the AOAO and the Malabes, the Malabes argue Act 282 constitutes 
a “substantial impairment of a contractual relationship[] ” ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
42 
 because “[a ] mortgage is a contract that transfers interests in 
real property as security for the performance of a contractual 
obligation for payment ” and “cannot be created by statute. ”  
Additionally, the Malabes assert there is no legitimate public 
purpose furthered by Act 282 ’s retroactive application to Part I 
of HRS Chapter 667, as the only effect of such retroactive 
application is “to eliminate AOAO ’s and other associations ’ 
liability in ongoing litigation to the detriment of homeowners 
and for the benefit of those associations[ ,]” which is not a 
legitimate purpose, citing Energy Reserves Group , Inc. v. Kansas 
Power & Light Co., 459 U.S. 400, 411 –12 (1983) and Anthony v. 
Kualoa Ranch, 69 Haw. 112, 118 –19, 736 P.2d 55, 60 (1987).    
  c. AOAO’s supplemental briefing 
 The AOAO asserts that “
the plain language of SB 551 is a 
‘clear legislative act ’ that has the practical effect of 
granting the AOAO ‘the power to extrajudicially sell another 
person’s property, ’ regardless of the presence or absence of 
power of sale language in the AOAO ’s governing documents. ”  
(Brackets omitted.)  The AOAO also maintains Act 282 applies to
its appeal because it merely “clarifies ” the legislature ’s 
intent and does not change existing law, citing Awakuni v. 
Awana, 115 Hawai ʻi 126, 143, 165 P.3d 1027, 1044 (2007).  T he 
AOAO argues that Act 282 “must be applied ” to this case because
courts are to “apply the law in effect at the time it renders  
 ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    *** 
 
43 
 its decision, ” Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., 511 U.S. 244, 264 
(1994), and when so applied, this court should reverse the ICA ’s 
vacatur of Count I, the Malabes ’ wrongful foreclosure claim.  
(Emphasis added.)   
 With respect to the constitutionality of Act 282  based on 
the Contracts Clause, the AOAO maintains there is no contractual 
relationship between the AOAO and the Malabes as “this 
proceeding is created and governed entirely by statute, ” and 
therefore Act 282 does not violate the Contracts Clause.  
Further, the AOAO argues Act 282 “neither grants the AOAO a 
mortgage, nor does it insert power of sale language in the 
AOAO’s governing documents ” because the AOAO “always had the 
right to utilize the nonjudicial foreclosure procedures set 
forth in HRS Chapter 667 in a like manner as a mortgage, 
regardless of the presence or absence of power of sale language 
in its governing documents, ” as set forth in Act 282.  According 
to the AOAO, “ [s]uch clarification of the statutory constructs, 
which giving rise to [the] statutory relationship at issue, does 
not violate the Contract Clause. ”   
 The AOAO argues because the Malabes purchased the A partment 
subject to the statutorily governed property regime of the AOAO 
that is subject to amendment, they cannot establish that there 
was a substantial impairment on any possible contractual 
relationship that may exist between them and the AOAO.  ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    *** 
 
44 
 Additionally, the AOAO 
contends Act 282 was enacted to further 
the legitimate public purpose addressed in its preamble.  The 
AOAO quotes from the preamble to argue that the “public purpose ” 
is to provide “associations . . . a more efficient alternative, 
such as power of sale foreclosure, to provide a remedy for 
recurring delinquencies ” as it is “crucial that condominium 
associations be able to secure timely payment of dues to provide 
services to all residents of a condominium community ” given that 
“condominiums provide a valuable housing resource in Hawaii, 
especially with limited space available for new development. ”   
  d. Analysis  
 With respect to the possible applicability of Act 282 to 
this case, we examine three parts: its preamble, the statutory 
amendments in Section s 3 of Act 282 (“Section 3”)  and 4, and 
provisions regarding its application or effectiveness (namely, 
the retroactive application provision) in Section 5  of Act 282 
(“Section 5”).   
  
 i. Retroactive a pplication (Section 5) 
 Section 5 states:  
Sections 3 and 4 of this Act shall be applied retroactively 
to any case, action, proceeding, or claim arising out of a 
nonjudicial  foreclosure under section 667 -5 (repealed June 
28, 2012), Hawaii Revised Statutes, and parts II and VI of 
chapter 667, Hawaii Revised Statutes, that arose before the 
effective date of this Act and in which a final non -
appealable judgment has not yet been entered.  
 
In other words, the legislature states that the statutory 
revisions in Sections 3 and 4 “shall be applied retroactively ” ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
45 
 to cases where the nonjudicial foreclosure occurred pursuant to 
Parts I (i.e., HRS § 667- 5), II, or VI of HRS Chapter 667.  As 
previously noted, the AOAO had foreclosed on the Malabes ’ 
Apartment pursuant to HRS § 667-5 in Part I  of HRS Chapter 667.    
 ii.  Statutory amendments (Sections 3 and 4)  
HRS § 514B- 146(a)(2), which creates the statutory lien for 
condominium associations and provides for the foreclosure of 
such liens, has been amended in Section 3  as follows: “The lien 
of the association may be foreclosed by action or by nonjudicial 
or power of sale foreclosure [procedures set forth in chapter 
667], regardless of the presence or absence of power of sale 
language in an association ’s governing documents, by the 
managing agent or board, acting on behalf of the association and 
in the name of the association . . . . ”    
Section 4 modifies the definition of “power of sale ” or 
“power of sale foreclosure ” in HRS § 667- 1, which provides 
definitions for the entire chapter, so that it reads: 
 ““Power of sale”  or “power of sale foreclosure ” means 
a nonjudicial foreclosure when [the]:  
 
(1) The mortgage contains, authorizes, permits, or 
provides for a power of sale, a power of sale  foreclosure, 
a power of sale remedy, or a nonjudicial foreclosure[ .]; or  
 
(2) For the purposes of part VI,  an association enforces 
its claim of an association lien, regardless of whether the 
association documents provide for a power of sale, a power 
of sale foreclosure, a power of sale remedy, or a 
nonjudicial foreclosure. ” 
 ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
46 
  Addressing Section 3  first, the plain language of the 
revisions to HRS § 514B-146(a)(2) limits the means by which 
condominium associations may foreclose on their liens to those: 
(1) “
by action, ” (2) “by nonjudicial, ” or (3) “power of sale 
foreclosure, regardless of the presence or absence of power of 
sale language in an association ’s governing documents. ”  When 
Section 3 is read together with the revisions to HRS § 667-1 in 
Section 4,  the result is the same, that there are three methods
by which condominium associations may foreclose their liens:  
(1) by judicial action, (2) by nonjudicial foreclosure when the 
mortgage contains a nonjudicial foreclosure or power of sale 
provision, or (3) by power of sale foreclosure, regardless of 
the presence or absence of power of sale language in an 
association’s governing documents.  With respect to the third 
method, Section 4 ’s amendment to HRS § 667- 1 specifically 
contemplates that such “power of sale foreclosure ” be conducted 
under Part VI, which is distinct from Part I of HRS Chapter 667,
and subject to new consumer protection provisions in Section 2. 30 
 
  
Thus, should Act 282 apply to this case, as urged by the 
AOAO, the AOAO ’s “authority ” to nonjudicially foreclose upon the 
Malabes under Part I of HRS Chapter 667 must fall into one of 
                         
30  Although the  definitions contained in HRS §  667-1 do not expressly 
apply to HRS § 514B-146, these amendments should be read together, because: 
(1) Chapter 514B does not define “power of sale ” or “power of sale 
foreclosure,”  and (2) Act 282 ’s amendments were meant to “clarify”  the 
condominium statutory scheme, and HRS §  514B-146 had previously referenced 
Chapter 667.   ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
47 
 these three methods
.  It clearly does not fall under the first, 
as the foreclosure was not a judicial action.  It also clearly 
does not fall under the third, as the foreclosure was not 
conducted pursuant to Part VI.  Thus, for the AOAO to have 
appropriately foreclosed on the Malabes ’ Apartment , its 
“authority” must have fallen under the second method, i.e., by 
nonjudicial foreclosure when the mortgage contains a nonjudicial 
foreclosure or power of sale provision. 
Given that Section 5 states that the revisions in Sections 
3 and 4 are to apply retroactively to cases involving 
nonjudicial foreclosures made under Part I of HRS Chapter 667, 
i.e., HRS § 667- 5, we return to the relevant text of that 
section to examine the impact of Secti ons 3 and 4 and the second 
method of foreclosure discussed above: 
Foreclosure under power of sale; notice; affidavit  
after sale.   (a)
  When a power of sale is contained in a 
mortgage, and where the mortgagee, the mortgagee ’s 
successor in interest, or any person authorized by the 
power to act in the premises, desires to foreclose under 
power of sale upon breach of a condition of the mortgage, 
the mortgagee, successor, or person shall be represented by 
an attorney who is licensed to practice law in the State 
and is physically located in the State.  
 
HRS § 667-5.  Again, by the plain language of the statute, the 
statute applies “[w]hen a power of sale is contained in a 
mortgage,”  which is the second means of foreclosure previously 
discussed.  Thus, the plain language of Act 282 ’s amendments 
does not change the analysis above with respect to nonjudicial 
foreclosures pursuant to Part I  of HRS Chapter 667 .  In other ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
48 
 words, nothing in HRS § 514B
-146 nor its legislative history 
provide any indication that the legislature provided “a blanket 
grant of powers of sale to all associations over all 
apartments/units within those associations. ”  Sakal, 143 Hawai ʻi 
at 228, 426 P.3d at 452.  Indeed, Act 282 ’s references to Part I 
of HRS Chapter 667 nonjudicial foreclosures repeatedly 
underscore that such foreclosures are those that occur “when a 
power of sale is contained in a mortgage. ”  Thus, as the Malabes 
argue, Act 282 did nothing to amend Part I  of HRS Chapter 667 ’s 
mortgage requirement.  
 Arguably, Section 5 would not have stated that Act 282 
“shall” apply retroactively to condominium association 
foreclosures made under Part I of HRS Chapter 667 if Act 282 has 
no practical effect on such foreclosures.  However, as 
previously discussed, the statutory textual changes in Sections 
3 and 4 are unambiguous and do not have any effect on  
HRS § 667-5.  Nevertheless, although “[o]ur statutory 
construction is guided by the following well established 
principles [,] our foremost obligation is to ascertain and give 
effect to the intention of the legislature, which is to be 
obtained primarily from the language contained in the statute 
itself,”  Lingle v. Hawai ʻi Gov’t Employees Ass ’n, AFSCME, Local 
152, AFL- CIO, 107 Hawaiʻi 178, 183, 111 P.3d 587, 592 (2005), to ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
49 
 the extent there may be ambiguity when Section 5 is construed 
alongside Sections 3 and 4, we next examine Act 282 ’s preamble.   
   iii. The preamble 
 With respect to reliance on subsequent legislative history , 
we recently stated  in an opinion construing HRS § 667 -1.5: 
[R]eliance  on a subsequent legislative committee report 
written 153 years after enactment of the statute 
underscores the criticism this approach has repeatedly 
garnered from the United States Supreme Court.   United 
States v. Texas, 507 U.S. 529, 535 n.4, 113 S.Ct. 1631, 123 
L.Ed.2d 245 (1993)  (“[S]ubsequent legislative history is a 
‘hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier’ 
Congress.” (quoting  Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. LTV 
Corp., 496 U.S. 633, 650, 110 S.Ct. 2668, 110 L.Ed.2d 579 
(1990))); United States v. Price, 361 U.S. 304, 313, 80 
S.Ct. 326, 4 L.Ed.2d 334 (1960) .  
 
Monalim, No. SCWC -16-0000807,  at 42-43.  Similar to  
HRS § 667-1.5 at issue in Monalim, the predecessor statute to 
the nonjudicial foreclosure process in HRS § 667 -5, repealed in 
2012, had been in existence for at least 135 years, since at 
least 1884.   Silva v. Lopez , 5 Haw. 262, 264 ( Haw. Kingdom 1884).  
Subsequent legislative history is a hazardous basi s for 
inferring the intent of an earlier legislature  after any passage 
of time.  The inherent flaws in  the doctrine as a method of 
ascertaining legislative intent is clearly manifest ed by its 
application to a  statute enacted more than 13 5 years ago .  
 In any event, Act 282  does not affect our analysis.  The 
preamble to Act 282 begins with an acknowledgement by the 
legislature that condominiums provide a valuable housing 
resource given limited land availability for development, that ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***

 the timely collection of association fees is necessary to 
provide services to all residents of a c ondominium community, 
and that delinquencies and enforcement expenses were unfairly 
burdening those condominium owners who did timely pay their 
fees.  See  2019 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 282, § 1 at 779.  The 
legislature then goes on to discuss the legislative in tent of 
amendments to the condominium statutory scheme since 1998 to 
support its “ find[ing] that condominium associations, since 
1999, have been authorized to conduct nonjudicial foreclosures 
regardless of the presence or the absence of power of sale 
language in an association ’s governing documents .”  Id.  
Specifically, the legislature states that “Act 236, Session 
Laws of Hawaii 1999, provided a statutory grant of power and an 
incorporation into written documents authorizing condominium 
associations to utilize nonjudicial foreclosure under sections 
667-5 (repealed June 28, 2012) [Part I of HRS Chapter 667] and 
667-40 [Part II of HRS Chapter 667] , Hawaii Revised Statutes, to 
enforce their liens[ ,]” and that such “intent was not abrogated ” 
by subsequent amendments to the condominium statutory regime.   
2019 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 282, § 1 at 779- 80.  (Emphasis added. )  
This characterization of Act 236 differs from the analysis of 
the same provision in Sakal , which interpreted Act 236 ’s 
amendment to HRS § 514A- 90 to mean that condominium associations 
could avail themselves of  the nonjudicial or power of sale ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
51 
 procedures contained in HRS Chapter 667, but that HRS § 514A-90 
did not grant a blanket statutory grant of power to condominiums 
to foreclose nonjudicially.  143 Hawai ʻi at 226, 426 P.3d at 450. 
     Even if subsequent legislative history were to be applied,31 
however, the differences in interpretation of the effect of Act 
236 in Sakal and Act 282 ’s preamble do not affect our analysis.  
This is because the reason why such legislative history is 
included is elucidated further in the preamble: 
Since the enactment of part VI of chapter 667, Hawaii 
Revised Statutes, associations have conducted nonjudicial 
foreclosures as part of their efforts to collect 
delinquencies and sustain their financial operations.  
Associations have done so subject to the restrictions on 
nonjudicial foreclosures and other collection options 
imposed by the legislature, which include:  
(1)  Prohibiting the use of nonjudicial foreclosure 
to collect fines, penalties, legal fees, or 
late fees; 
(2)  Requiring associations to give an owner sixty 
days to cure a default before proceeding with 
the nonjudicial foreclosure and to accept 
reasonable payment plans of up to twelve 
months; and  
(3)  Requiring associations to provide owners with 
contact information for approved housing 
counselors and approved budget and credit 
counselors.  
However, the intermediate court of appeals in Sakal 
v. Association of Apartment Owners of Hawaiian Monarch, 143 
Haw. 219, 426 P.3d 443 (2018), held that the legislature 
intended that associations can only conduct nonjudicial 
foreclosures if they have specific authority to conduct 
nonjudicial foreclosures in their declaration or bylaws or 
in an agreement  with the owner being foreclosed upon . 
                         
31  Contrary to the dissent ’s assertion , we do not use subsequent 
legislative histor y in a limited fashion  and our examination  of the preamble, 
the statutory amendments in Sections 3 and 4, and provisions regarding its 
application or effectiveness regarding retroactive application in Section 5 
was to ascertain the actual effect of Act 282.  S ubsequent legislative 
history remains a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier  
legislature, even of the 1999 legislature that passed Part II of HRS Chapter 
667.  See Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. , 496 U.S. 633, 650 (1990).  ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
52 
 The legislative history indicates this was not the 
intent of the legislature in 1999, nor in legislatures that 
have made subsequent amendments.  Therefore, this Act 
confirms the legislative intent that condominium 
associations should be able to use nonjudicial foreclosure 
to collect delinquencies regardless of the presence or 
absence of power of sale language in an association ’s 
governing documents.  
This Act also provides an additional  consumer 
protection by requiring the foreclosing association to 
offer mediation with any notice of default and intention to 
foreclose and the procedures when mediation is chosen by 
the consumer.  
 
2019 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 282, § 1 at 780 (emphases added).  
Thus, the purpose of Act 282 is to directly address Sakal’s 
holding 
“that the legislature intended that associations can 
only conduct nonjudicial foreclosures if they have specific 
authority to conduct nonjudicial foreclosures in their 
declaration or bylaws or in an agreement with the owner being 
foreclosed on[, ]” by ensuring that condominium associations may 
conduct nonjudicial foreclosures under Part VI of HRS Chapter 
667 regardless of the presence or absence of power of sale 
language in an association ’s governing documents.  Indeed, based
on its statements in the preamble, it appears that the 
legislature assumes that since Part VI was enacted in 2012,  
associations have conducted nonjudicial foreclosures “subject to
the restrictions on nonjudicial foreclosures and other 
collection options imposed by the legislature. ”  The legislature
states that in addition to these restrictions, Act 282 would 32 
 
 
                         
32  “Part VI of HRS chapter 667, which provides an alternative power of 
sale foreclosure procedure specifically tailored to associations, did not 
exist prior to 2012. ”  Sakal, 143 Hawai ʻi at 224, 426 P.3d at 448.  ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
53 
 provide “an additional consumer protection ” to require an offer 
of any mediation with any notice of default, as detailed in 
Section 2. 
 In sum, the purpose of the legislature in enacting Act 282, 
as set forth in the Act ’s preamble, is to ensure that 
associations may conduct nonjudicial foreclosures under Part VI 
of HRS Chapter 667 regardless of the presence or absence of 
power of sale language in an association ’s governing documents.  
This interpretation is also supported by the Conference 
Committee Report that accompanied the version of the bill that 
was ultimately passed.33  
                         
33   [Y]our Committee on Conference notes that condominium  
associations have relied for years on the remedy of 
nonjudicial foreclosure as a way of collecting delinquent 
maintenance fees, which are necessary for the basic 
operations of associations.  Your Committee on Conference 
further finds that under the Sakal case, many associations 
have lost the benefit of the nonjudicial foreclosure 
process.  As a result, there are concerns that an 
association’s ability to conduct a nonjudicial foreclosure 
will no longer depend on legislative intent, but whether 
specific language in the declaration or bylaws was included 
when the project was first created.  Your Committee on 
Conference notes that the extensive legislative history 
indicates this was not the intent of the Legislature.  
 Accordingly, amendments to this measure are necessary 
to clarify that condominium associations should be able to 
use nonjudicial foreclosure to collect delinquencies 
regardless of the presence or absence of power of sale 
language in an association’s governing documents.  
 
Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 65 (Apr. 25, 2019), available at  
https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2019/CommReports/SB551_CD1_CCR65_.pdf; 
2019 House Journal, at 1566 (statement of Committee on Conference).  
 
 Again, the Malabes ’ foreclosure was conducted pursuant to Part I  of HRS 
Chapter 667, and the Sakal foreclosure was conducted pursuant to Part II  of 
HRS Chapter 667.  Thus, Act 282 affects neither.  ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
54 
  This supports the plain language statutory interpretation 
of Sections 3 and 4 previously discussed.  Nothing in Act 282 ’s 
preamble or accompanying legislative history indicates that the 
purpose of Act 282 was to ensure that condominium associations 
may conduct foreclosures under Part I of HRS Chapter 667 without 
a mortgage.  Rather, it appears that the legislature found it 
significant that associations ’ power to nonjudicially foreclose 
be tempered by specific statutory restrictions and requirements, 
including a sixty- day opportunity to cure that is not available 
under Part I of HRS Chapter 667, and even added protections in 
Section 2.  Thus, despite Act 282 ’s inclusion of the 
legislature’s perspective of the legislative history behind 
amendments permitting condominiums to nonjudicially foreclose in 
certain circumstances, for the foregoing reasons, that 
legislative history does not bear on how the statutory 
amendments in Sections 3 and 4 are to be construed.    
Based on the foregoing analysis, Act 282 simply does not 
apply to this litigation.  Accordingly, based on the doctrine of
constitutional avoidance,  Rees, 113 Hawai ʻi at 456, 153 P.3d at 
1141, 
we therefore do not address the Malabes ’ constitutional 
challenges to Act 282.     
  We also note, however, that although not binding on state 
courts, the decision of the United States District Court for the
District of Hawai ʻi that Act 282 i
s unconstitutional as violative 
 ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
55 
 of the Contracts Clause would be entitled to respectful 
consideration.  State v. Gates, 576 P.2d 1357, 1359 (Ariz. 1978) 
(citing  State v. Norflett , 337 A.2d 609 (N.J. 1975) ; People v. 
Bradley, 460 P.2d 129 (Cal. 1969) .34  
Despite ruling that there were no constitutional violations 
based on separation of powers, due process, equal protection, or 
takings without just compensation, Judge Kobayashi ruled as 
follows with respect to the alleged violation of the 
Contracts 
Clause:35 
[]Contracts Clause 
 The Contracts Clause restricts the power of 
States to disrupt contractual arrangements.   It 
provides that “ [n]o state shall .  . . pass any . . . 
Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts. ”  U.S. 
Const., Art. I, § 10, cl. 1 . . . .  [T]he Clause 
applies to any kind of contract.   
 At the same time, not all laws affecting pre -
existing contracts violate the Clause.   To determine 
when such a law crosses the constitutional line, this 
Court has long applied a two -step test.  The 
threshold issue is whether the state law has operated 
as a substantial impairment  of a contractual 
relationship.  In answering that question, the Court 
has considered the extent to which the law undermines 
the contractual bargain, interferes with a party ’s 
reasonable expectations, and prevents the party from 
safeguarding or reinstating his rights.   If such 
factors show a substantial impairment, the inquiry 
turns to the means and ends of the legislation.   In 
particular, the Court has asked whether the state law 
                         
34  As further noted in Gates: 
 
Even with respect to federal constitutional issues, the 
state and lower federal courts occupy comparable positions, 
a sort of parallelism with each governed by the same 
reviewing authority the United States Supreme Court.   State 
v. Coleman, 46 N.J. 16, 214 A.2d 393 (1965) , cert. 
den., 383 U.S. 950, 86 S.Ct. 1210, 16 L.Ed.2d 212 (1966) . 
 
576 P.2d at 1359.  
 
35  See supra note 4.   ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
56 
 is drawn in an 
“appropriate ” and “reasonable ” way to 
advance “a significant and legitimate public purpose. ”  
 
Sveen v. Melin, --- U.S. ---, 138 S.Ct. 1815, 1821 -22, 201 
L.Ed.2d 180 (2018) (some alterations in Sveen). 
 
1) First Step 
 The first step has three components: whether there is 
a contractual relationship, whether a change in law impairs 
that contractual relationship, and whether the impairment  
is substantial.   
 This Court previously recognized that a condominium’ s 
governing documents are contractual obligations between the 
condominium association and a condominium owner.   A 
contractual relationship did exist between Plaintiffs and 
the AOAO.   Under that contract, Plaintiffs were obligated 
to pay association fees and, when they failed to do so, the 
AOAO had the ability to obtain a lien and seek satisfaction.  
Implicit in the AOAO ’s contractual right to lien recovery 
is the obligation that the AOAO  act in good faith and 
pursue the recovery in a legally permissible manner.   
 As this case currently stands, the AOAO obtained 
Plaintiffs ’ unit as a result of a nonjudicial foreclosure 
(a process to which the AOAO was not legally permitted to 
use at the time the contract was entered) and Plaintiffs 
sought damages resulting from this foreclosure by filing 
the instant action.   Act 282 became law and now 
retroactively validates the AOAO ’s nonjudicial foreclosure 
of Plaintiffs ’ unit and extinguishes Plaintiffs ’ ability to 
recover for their wrongful foreclosure claim.   Thus, the 
act does interfere with a party ’s reasonable expectations, 
and prevents the party from safeguarding or reinstating his 
rights.  
 All three parts of the first step of the analysis 
have therefore been met.  
 
2) Second Step 
 The second step of the analysis - whether Act 282 is 
a reasonable way to address a significant and legitimate 
public purpose – requires scrutiny of  the act’s purpose 
which is to confirm  the legislative intent that condominium 
associations should be able to use nonjudicial foreclosure 
to collect delinquencies regardless of the presence or 
absence of power of sale language in an association’ s 
governing documents.   2019 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 282,  § 1 at 
780.  Because Act 282 benefits  a favored group and not a 
basic societal interest, it does not appear to be enacted 
for the public good.   Most telling is that Act 282 serves 
to revive the Part I process solely for condominium 
associations and without the homeowner/consumer protections 
enacted by legislatures in 2012 and in subsequent years. 
The Court therefore finds Act 282 does not address a 
significant and legitimate public purpose.  
 Act 282 therefore is unconstitutional because it 
violates Plaintiffs ’ rights under the Contracts Clause  of 
the United States Constitution.  
 ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
57 
 Galima, 2020 WL 1822599, at *13-*15 (case citations, some 
quotation marks, and brackets omitted).  Thus, Judge Kobayashi 
has ruled Act 282 unconstitutional based on the Contracts 
Clause.   
 In any event, as discussed above, Act 282 does not apply to 
the Malabes’ claims based on Part I of HRS Chapter 667.  It is 
therefore unnecessary for us to consider the multiple 
constitutional challenges that the Malabes present.   
B. Based on standards applicable to HRCP Rule 12(b)(6) motions 
 to dismiss, the Malabes ’ UDAP claim should not have been 
 dismissed 
  
 Finally, we turn to the Malabes ’ certiorari application.  
The issue is whether the ICA correctly affirmed the circuit 
court’s dismissal of the UDAP count in the Malabes ’ December 13, 
2016 complaint based on the four- year statute of limitations for 
UDAP claims based on its ruling that equitable tolling for 
fraudulent concealment was inapplicable as a matter of law.  
 As repeatedly noted, t his case comes to us from the circuit 
court’s grant of a HRCP 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.  In Reyes-
Toledo, we reaffirmed the notice pleading standard, and noted 
that 
 a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to 
state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the 
plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of [their] 
claim that would entitle [them] to relief.   The appellate 
court must therefore view a plaintiff ’s complaint in a 
light most favorable to [them] in order to determine 
whether the allegations contained therein could warrant 
relief under any alternative theory.  For this reason, in 
reviewing a circuit court ’s order dismissing a complaint .  ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
58 
 .
 . the appellate court ’s consideration is strictly limited 
to the allegations of the complaint, and the appellate 
court must deem those allegations to be true.  
 
143 Hawai ʻi at 257, 428 P.3d at 769  (ellipsis in original) . 
 Thus, courts must accept the Malabes ’ complaint allegations 
as true.  According to the compla int, the AOAO published a 
notice that it would sell the Malabes ’ Apartment pursuant to  
HRS § 667-5 and HRS Chapters 514A and/or 514B, including  
HRS § 514B-146, on December 17, 2010.  The complaint asserts 
 
HRS § 667-5 was a nonjudicial foreclosure process that could 
only be used by the holder of a mortgage containing a power of 
sale, and that the AOAO did not hold a mortgage containing a 
power of sale.  The complaint further asserts that HRS § 667-5 
did not contain consumer protection provisions contained in Part 
II of Chapter 667, and that the AOAO conducted the sale under 
HRS § 667-5 to circumvent such protections for its own gain, in 
violation of fiduciary duties, executing a quitclaim deed to 
itself as grantor and grantee on January 4, 2011, which was 
recorded on January 7, 2011.  The Malabes also note  that 
Santiago holds the duty to avoid misrepresentations so strong 
that they, as plaintiffs, were under no duty to discover the 
truth.  137 Hawai ʻi at 153, 366 P.3d at 628 .  They assert  the 
AOAO fraudulently concealed the wrong it was committing by 
implying, stating, and/or misrepresenting that it was authorized 
to use HRS § 667-5 and/or that it held a mortgage with a power ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
59 (continued. . .)  
 of sale when it did not.  
Finally, they assert they did not 
discover their claims until around July 2016.   
 The Malabes ’ complaint was filed on December 13, 2016, 
almost six years after the notice of sale and the quitclaim 
deed.  The Malabes assert the UDAP four-year statute of 
limitations under HRS § 480- 24 was equitably tolled by HRS § 
657-20’s extension for fraudulent concealment.36   
                         
36  With respect to the UDAP claim, the basis for the circuit court ’s 
dismissal was unclear, but the ICA ruled the circuit court ’s dismissal of 
this claim was proper based solely on the statute of limitations.  On 
certiorari, the Malabes continue to assert the  four-year statute of 
limitations under HRS § 480-24 quoted below was tolled pursuant to  
HRS § 657- 20, which  provides: 
 
§657-20  Extension by fraudulent concealment.   If any 
person who is liable to any of the actions mentioned in 
this part or section 663 -3, fraudulently conceals the 
existence of the cause of action or the identity of any 
person who is liable for the claim from the knowledge of 
the person entitled to bring the action, the action may be 
commenced at any time within six years after the person  who 
is entitled to bring the same discovers or should have 
discovered, the existence of the cause of action or the 
identity of the person who is liable for the claim, 
although the action would otherwise be barred by the period 
of limitations.   
 
 The dissent points out that in Rundgren v. Bank of New York Mellon, 777 
F. Supp. 2d 1224 (D. Haw. 2011), the United States District Court for the 
District of Hawai ʻi determined that HRS §  657-20, which allows for the statute 
of limitations to be tolled by reason of  fraudulent concealment for claims 
“mentioned in [Part I of HRS Chapter 657] or section 663 -3,” did not apply 
for UDAP claims, which arise under HRS Chapter 480.  777 F. Supp. 2d at 1228 -
29.  
 With respect to the applicability of HRS § 657 -20 to a HRS Chapter 480 
UDAP claim, HRS § 657 -10 (1985) provides that “[t]his part shall not extend 
to any action which is, or shall be, limited by any statute to be brought 
within a shorter time than is herein prescribed; but the action shall be 
brought within the time l imited by the statute.”   
 Based on the  language of HRS § 480-24, see supra  note 12, it appears 
HRS § 657- 20 would not apply to a HRS Chapter 480 claim.  
 This court has yet to determine, however, when a cause of action 
“accrues”  for purposes of the UDAP statute.   This court has also yet to 
determine whether the Santiago holding, that the duty to avoid 
misrepresentations is so strong that plaintiffs are under  no duty to discover ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
60 (continued. . .)  
                                                                                
(. . .continued)  
the truth, 137 Hawai ʻi at 153, 366 P.3d at 645 , would also apply to equitable 
tolling of a UDAP claim.   
 In this regard,  as the dissent also points out, Rundgren recognized  
“equitable tolling” by reason of fraudulent concealment of the statute of 
limitations governing a HRS § 480- 2 claim.  The dissent maintains, however, 
that based on Au v. Au, 63 Haw. 210, 626 P.2d 173 (1981), equitable tolling 
could not apply to the Malabes’ UDAP claim:  
 
 The fraudulent concealment which will postpone the 
operation of the statute must  be the concealment of the 
fact that plaintiff has a cause of action.  If there is a 
known cause of action there can be no fraudulent 
concealment. .  . . 
 It is not necessary that a party should know the 
details of the evidence by which to establish his cause of 
action.  It is enough that he knows that a cause of action 
exists in his favor, and when he has this knowledge, it is 
his own fault if he does not avail himself of those means 
which the law provides for prosecuting or preserving his 
claim. 
 
63 Haw. at 215– 16, 626 P.2d at 178 (ellipsis in original).  The Malabes’  
complaint pled that the AOAO had fraudulently concealed the wrongfulness of 
the foreclosure proceedings by implying, stating, and /or misrepresenting that 
it held a mortgage with a power of sal e when it did not, or that it was 
authorized to use HRS § 667 -5 when it could not , that they r elied on the 
false statements and representations of the AOAO concerning the AOAO’s right 
to conduct a public sale pursuant to HRS § 667 -5, and that they  were ent itled 
to so rely because they were members of the AOAO, because of the AOAO’s 
trustee- like relationship with th em, and because the AOAO was acting as an 
agent or attorney on their behalf.   Based on our notice pleading standards, 
we therefore cannot say tha t “it appears beyond doubt that the [Malabes]  can 
prove no set of facts in support of [their] claim that would entitle [them] 
to relief” with respect to equitable tolling by reason of fraudulent 
concealment based on the Au standard .  
 We also strongly disagree with the dissent’s impos ition of federal 
court pleading standards for fraudulent concealment onto our state courts.  
Rundgren explicitly states:  
 
 “To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must 
contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 
‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’ ”  
Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 
L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 
550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)); 
see also  Weber v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, 521 F.3d 1061, 
1065 (9th Cir.  2008).  This tenet— that the court must 
accept as true all of the allegations contained in the 
complaint —“is inapplicable to legal conclusions.”   Iqbal, 
129 S.Ct. at 1949.  Accordingly, “[t]hrea dbare recitals of 
the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere 
conclusory statements, do not suffice.”   Id. (citing 
Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955).   Rather, “[a] 
claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
61 
  The Malabes ’ assertion that the AOAO “fraudulently 
concealed the wrong [it was] committing by implying, stating 
and/or misrepresenting that . . . [it] held a mortgage with a 
power of sale when in fact [it] did not [,]” must be taken as 
true.     
 
In ruling on the AOAO ’s HRCP Rule 12(b)(6) motion to 
dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be 
granted, a court must view the complaint in the ligh t most 
favorable to the Malabes.  Based on the applicable notice  
                                                                               
(. . .continued)  
factual content that allows the court to draw the 
reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the 
misconduct alleged.”   Id. at 1949 (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. 
at 556, 127 S.Ct. 1955).   Factual allegations that only 
permit the court to infer “the mere possibility of 
misconduct” do not show that the pleader is entitled to 
relief.  Id. at 1950. 
 
777 F. Supp. 2d at 1227.  The pleading standard for “fraudulent concealment” 
cited in Rundgren  and applied by the dissent is consistent with such 
“plausibility” standards:   
 
 To avoid the bar of limitation by invoking the 
concept of fraudulent concealment, the plaintiff must 
allege facts showing affirmative conduct upon the part of 
the defendant which would, under the circumstances of the 
case, lead a reasonable person to believe that he did not 
have a claim for relief.  Silence or passive conduct of the 
defendant is not deemed fraudulent, unless the relationship 
of the parties imposes a duty upon the defendant to make 
disclosure.  
 
777 F. Supp. 2d at 1230 (quoting Rutledge v. Boston Woven Hose & Rubber Co., 
576 F.2d 248, 250 (9th Cir. 1978)).  
 
 In Reyes- Toledo, we expressly rejected the Twombly /Iqbal “plausibility” 
pleading standards, and reaffirmed that our courts are governed by “notice” 
pleading standards.  143 Hawai ʻi at 252, 428 P.3d at 764.  We have never 
adopted the “plausibility ” pleading standard for fraudulent concealment 
stated above.  Thus, the Malabes have satisfied our notice pleading standards,
