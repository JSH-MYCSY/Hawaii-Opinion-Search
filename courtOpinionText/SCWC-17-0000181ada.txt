. . . . is whether the  Hoʻomoana Foundation’s (the foundation) proposed 
campground project can be authorized by special use permit or 
whether a district boundary amendment is required.   The specific 
exclusion of overnight camps from permitted uses in Hawaiʻi 
Revised Statutes  (HRS) § 205-4.5(a)(6)1 means that the public and 
private recreational use of overnight camps is not permitted  in 
class A and B land in agricultural districts , and cannot be 
permitted by special use permit.  In addition, Mahaʻulepu v. Land 
Use Comm ission, 71 Haw. 332, 790 P.2d 906 (1990 ), superseded by 
statute, 2005 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 205, § § 2-3 at 669-71, which 
held that  a use not permitted under HRS § 205-4.5(a)(6) could be 
authorized by special use permit, is overruled because it was 
                     
1  Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes  (HRS) § 205-4.5 (Supp. 2015) “Permissible uses 
within the agricultural districts” provides in relevant part:  
 
(a) Within the agricultural district, all lands with soil 
classified by the land study bureau's detailed land 
classification as overall (master) productivity rating 
class A or B and for solar energy facilities, class B 
or C, shall be restricted to the following permitted 
uses: 
 
 . . . . 
 
(6)  Public and private open area types of 
recreational uses, including day camps, picnic 
grounds, parks, and riding stables, but not including 
dragstrips, airports, drive -in theaters, golf 
courses, golf driving ranges, country clubs, and 
overnight camps[.]  
 
 . . . . 
 
(b) Uses not expressly permitted in subsection (a) shall be 
prohibited, except the uses permitted as provided in 
sections 205 -6 and 205 -8[.] *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
3 incorrectly decided.  Because the foundation’s proposed 
campground project includes a public or private recreational 
overnight camp  use, the project  requires a district bo undary 
amendment.   
I. BACKGROUND  
A. Factual Background  
The Land Use Commission (LUC)  described the 
foundation’s proposed camp ground project as follows:  
DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPERTY  
 
8. The Property is situated along Hokiokio Place, 
adjacent to and  bounded by the  Lahaina Bypass Road between 
the Puamana Planned Unit  Development and the agriculturally 
zoned Puʻunoa Subdivision  . . . at Lahaina, Maui, Hawaiʻi.  
Kauaʻula Stream flows on one  side of the Property.  The lots 
within the Puʻunoa Subdivision are situated im mediately  
mauka of the Property.  
 
9. The Property consists of approximately 7.9 acres of 
land and  represents a portion of the approximately 22.678 -
acre parcel []. 
 
10. The Property is situated within the State Land Use 
Agricultural  District.  
 
11. The Proper ty is owned by Kauaula Land Company, LLC, 
and is leased to Hoʻomoana. 
 
12. The Property has soil classified by the [Land Study 
Bureau’s] detailed land  classification as overall (master) 
productivity rating class B.  Specifically, the Property  is 
situated o n “B87i” rated land.  
 
13. The Property was previously used for sugarcane 
cultivation.  
 
14. In addition to the Property, [the parcel] includes an 
approximately 9 -acre area used as a retirement stable for 
horses and a pproximately  5.8 acres that are part  of the 
Lahaina Watershed Flood Control project area.  
 
PROPOSED USE OF THE PROPERTY  
 
15. Hoʻomoana plans to develop the Project as an overnight  
campground for homeless and commercial campers  with an *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
4 agricultural field for  possible future uses by the campers 
on the Property.  The name of the Project is  Kauaula 
Campground.  
 
16. Under Hoʻomoana’s proposal, the Project would consist 
of 2 acres,  while the remaining adjacent 5.9 acres would be 
reserved as an agricultural field to  be used by the 
campground occupants for therapy and work.  It is 
envisioned that the  [homeless]  campers may work in the 
agricultural field to  supplement their rental fees.   
Homeless campers are expected to pay $10 a night, while the 
commercial campers  would be charged more.  The camping fees 
are anticipated to underwrite the expenses  of the 
campground.  Although some of the campers may wish to 
participate in farming  activities on the Property, there is 
no guarantee that the agricultural field would result  in 
future agricultural productivity nor is there a current 
requirement placed upon the  campers to engage in 
agricultural pursuits.  
 
17. The 2-acre area of the Project would have up to 26 
pods for tents  accommodating up to 80 people.  Tents are to 
be provid ed by the campers.  It is intended that both the 
homeless campers and the commercial campers would be  
camping alongside each other.  In addition to the pods, 
showers, toilet facilities, fire pits  or camp stove areas, 
a paved parking area, and a charging st ation for campers 
are proposed.  Homeless campers would be allowed to stay 
for two to three months or  more as approved by the 
campground manager.  It is unclear how long commercial  
campers would be allowed to use the grounds, but any stay 
would need to be approved  by the manager.  
 
18. Hoʻomoana does not know whether there will be 
sufficient use to  justify continued operations, nor does 
Hoʻomoana know whether the Project will prove  successful in 
addressing some of the needs of the homeless  [people]  in 
West Maui. 
 
19. The Project is being initiated on a trial basis.

2  No party challenged the LUC’s Findings of Fact describing the property 
and the proposed camp ground project before the circuit court  or before the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals  (ICA).  Findings of fact that are not 
challenged on appeal are binding on the appellate court.  See Bremer v.

5 B. Procedural History  
1. Administrative Proceedings  
The foundation filed an application for a special use 
permit with the Maui Planning  Commission , which held a hearing 
regarding the application on  July 28,  2015. 
On December 4, 2015,  the Puʻunoa Homeowners Association  
and its president Devonne Lane  (the homeowners3) filed a petition 
with the LUC seeking a declaratory order that the camp ground 
project required a district boundary amendment and could not be 
authorized by a special use permit.  The homeowners live next to 
the proposed project site.   The homeowners argued that the 
foundation’s proposed use did not promote the objectives of 
chapter 205 because there was no guarantee of agricultural 
activity at the proposed camp ground, making a special use permit 
unwarranted.  
The County of Maui Department of Planning  (Maui 
Planning Department ); the Office of Planning , State of Hawaiʻi 
(State Planning  Office); and the foundation all filed position 
statements with the LUC  arguing that a special use permit, not a 
                     
3  Reference to “the homeowners” includes the Puʻunoa Homeowners 
Association and Devonne Lane  until Ross Scott was substituted for Devonne 
Lane during the ICA proceedings  on February 5, 2019 .  From February 5, 2019  
until February 8, 2023 , “the homeowners” refers to the Puʻunoa Homeowners 
Association and Ross Scott.   On February 8, 2023, Courtney L . Lambrecht was 
substituted for Ross Scott.  From February 8, 2023 onward, “the homeowners” 
refers to the Puʻunoa Homeowners Association and Courtney L. Lambrecht.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
6 district boundary amendment, is appropriate.  The foundation  
also petitioned to intervene in the action.  
On February 24, 2016, the LUC heard the homeowner’s 
petition and the foundation’s petition to intervene at a public 
meeting.  The LUC heard testimony from nearby residents , and 
from the homeowners ’ counsel , the Maui Planning Department ’s 
counsel, the State  Planning Office ’s counsel , and the 
foundation ’s counsel .  A majority of the LUC voted to grant  the 
homeowners ’ petition , and then unanimously voted to deny the 
foundation’s motion to intervene as moot.  
The LUC’s March 3, 2016 declaratory order  concluded 
that the camp ground project could not be permitted by special 
use permit and required a district boundary amendment.   The LUC 
determined :  
5. In this case, the clear prohibition of overnight 
camps on class A and  class B rated lands is irreconcilable 
with the provisions of HRS §  205-6 that permit  certain 
“unusual and reasonable uses ” within agricultural districts 
other than for which  the district is classified.  By 
expressly prohibiting overnight camps on class A and class  
B rated lands, the legislature effectively determined that 
the use of overnight camp  facilities on class A and class B 
rated lands is unreasonable.   
 
6. To adopt the interpretation of Hoʻomoana, [the State 
Planning Office ], and the [Maui Planning Department ] that a 
special use permit ma y be used to allow the Project on 
class A and class B rated  agricultural lands despite the 
clear language to the contrary would mean that the  counties 
could define away completely any statutory restrictions on 
agricultural uses.  It results in treating a c lear and 
explicit statutory prohibition as a nullity, and it results 
in treating an implicit determination of the legislature 
that overnight camps on land  classified as class A and 
class B is an unreasonable use on such land as a nullity, 
and as such must be rejected.  The only way that overnight 
camps such as those proposed in  the Project can be allowed *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
7 on the Property is to change its land use classification to 
one where overnight camps would be permitted.  A change in 
the land use classification  would re quire a district  
boundary amendment.  
 
The LUC also filed an order denying the foundation’s petition to 
intervene as moot.  
2. Circuit Court Proceedings    
On March 29, 2016, the foundation appealed  the LUC’s 
declaratory order and order denying the foundation’s motion to 
intervene  to the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (circuit 
court).  The foundation asked the circuit court to reverse the 
LUC’s orders.  The foundation argued the plain language of HRS 
§ 205-4.5(a)(6) does not mean that overnight camps can never be 
allowed, but rather means that overnight camps are not an “ open 
area type of recreational use ” and may be permitted if 
determined to be an “unusual and reasonable use [].”  The 
foundation also argued the LUC failed to follow  Mahaʻulepu, which 
“found that HRS  § 205-4.5(b) allows uses for which special 
permits may be obtained under HRS §  205-6”4 and applies to the 
present matter.  
                     
4  HRS § 205 -6 (2017) provides in relevant part:  
 
(a) Subject to this section, the county planning commission 
may permit certain unusual and reasonable uses within 
agricultural and rural districts other than those for 
which the district is classified.  Any person who 
desires to use the person's land within an  agricultural 
or rural district other than for an agricultural or 
rural use, as the case may be, may petition the 
planning commission of the county within which the 
person's land is located for permission to use the 
person's land in the manner desired.   Each county may *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
8  
. . . . The LUC countered it properly interpreted HRS §§ 205-
4.5 and 205 -6: the more specific restrictions against overnight 
camps should prevail against the more general provisions for 
special use permits, and overnight camps can never be 
“reasonable” uses under HRS § 205-6 because they are explicitly 
excluded  in HRS § 205-4.5.  Further, a contrary reading would 
render the  specific restrictions against overnight camps a 
nullity, which should be avoided.  
The homeowners argued the foundation was attempting to 
circumvent the land use laws and achieve spot zoning b y seeking 
a special use permit.  The homeowners emphasized the Hawaiʻi 
Constitution and HRS chapter 205 both enshrine the protection of 
agricultural lands.  
                     
establish the appropriate fee for processing the 
special permit petition.  Copies of the special permit 
petition shall be forwarded to the land use commission, 
the office of planning , and the department of 
agriculture for their review and com ment.  
 
. . . . 
 
(c) The county planning commission may, under such 
protective restrictions as may be deemed necessary, 
permit the desired use, but only when the use would 
promote the effectiveness and objectives of this 
chapter; provided that a use proposed for designated 
important agricultural lands shall not conflict with 
any part of this chapter.  A decision in favor of the 
applicant shall require a majority vote of the total 
membership of the county planning commission.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
9 On February 16, 2017, the circuit court entered its 
Final Judgment in favor of the foundation, pursu ant to its 
January 4, 2017  Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order 
Vacating the Land Use Commission, State of Hawaiʻi’s Decisions 
and Orders Entered on March 3, 2016 .  The circuit court held 
that overnight camps are allowable by special use permit.  The 
circuit court held HRS § 205-4.5(a)(6) unambiguously means that 
overnight camps are not “ open area types of recreational uses ” 
and noted the relevant statutory language had been directly 
addressed in Mahaʻulepu. 
3. Intermediate Court of Appeals Proceedings  
The LUC and the homeowners  appealed  the circuit 
court’s Final Judgment to the ICA . 
Before the ICA, t he LUC asserted that HRS §  205-4.5(a) 
creates three  categories of uses : (1) expressly permitted uses, 
(2) uses not mentioned in HRS § 205 -4.5(a) that are prohibited 
by default per HRS § 205-4.5(b) but can be approved by special 
permit, and (3) uses expressly not permitted under HRS § 205-
4.5(a).  Regarding the third category,  the LUC explained , 
“[b]ecause the use is specified, that implies  that the 
Legislature disapproves of the use and considers it inconsistent 
with the purposes of the  land use statutes and the agricultural 
classification.  Therefore, such a use should not be subject to 
the special permit process. ”  (Footnote and citations omitted.)  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
10 The LUC argued that because the third category of uses fails to 
satisfy the criteria applicable to special permits as a matter 
of law, allowing such uses to go through the special permit 
process would be pointless .  The LUC noted HRS § 205-4.5(b) 
applies to uses subsection (a) is silent on, but does not apply 
to uses expressly not permitted .  As to Mahaʻulepu, the LUC 
argued that because the legislature clarified that golf courses 
cannot be authorized by special permit in 2005, the same should 
be presumed for the other uses excluded in HRS § 205-4.5(a)(6) . 
The homeowners contended  that Mahaʻulepu is no longer 
good law  and emphasized that the relevant legislative history 
evinces an intent to protect agriculture.  
The foundation  maintained the statute refers to two 
categories of uses: (1) expressly permitted uses and (2) all 
other uses that are prohibited by default , because the statute 
does not refer to “expressly not permitted” uses .  The 
foundation also noted that overnight st ays on agricultural lands 
are not contrary to the objectives of chapter 205 because HRS 
§ 205-4.5(a)(14) permits “[a] gricultural tourism activities, 
including overnight accommodations of twenty -one days or less  
. . . .” 
On May 23, 2022 t he ICA issued a mem orandum opinion  
vacating the circuit court’s decision with regard to the 
intervention issue  and remanded .  The ICA concluded it was bound *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
11 by Mahaʻulepu, making the LUC’s decision contradicting Mahaʻulepu 
palpably erroneous.  However, the ICA observed that the specific 
exclusion of overnight camps should control over the general 
availability of special permits  in keeping with canons of 
statutory construction and furthering the statutory scheme .  The 
ICA issued its Judgment on Appeal on June 24, 2022. 
4. Application for Writ of Certiorari  
In timely application s, the LUC  and the homeowners 
both argue Mahaʻulepu should be overruled and special permits 
should not be used to approve expressly not permitted uses on 
class A and B agricultural land . 
In response, the foundation argue s the doctrine of 
stare decisis is particularly strong regarding statutory 
interpretation because if the legislature disagrees with a 
court’s interpretation of a statute, the legislature can amend 
the law.   The foundation further contends  overruling Mahaʻulepu 
is unwarranted . 
The foundation’s p rocedural due process argument  
regarding intervention  raised before the circuit court and the 
ICA was not raised on certiorari, and as such will not be 
addressed.     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
12 II. STANDARD S OF REVIEW  
 
A. Review of agency decisions  
[T]he standard of review, as set forth in HRS § 91 -14, is 
as follows:  
 
Upon review of the record, the court may affirm the 
decision of the agency or remand the case with 
instructions for further proceedings; or it may 
reverse or modify the  decision and order if the 
substantial rights of the petitioners may have been 
prejudiced because the administrative findings, 
conclusions, decisions, or orders are:  
 
(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory 
provisions;  
 
(2) In excess of the statuto ry authority or 
jurisdiction of the agency;  
 
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure;  
 
(4) Affected by other error of law;  
 
(5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, 
probative, and substantial evidence on the whole 
record; or  
 
(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, o r characterized by 
abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise 
of discretion.  
 
HRS § 91 -14(g). 
 
Conclusions of law are reviewed de novo, pursuant to 
subsections (1), (2) and (4); questions regarding 
procedural defects are reviewable under subsectio n (3); 
findings of fact (FOF) are reviewable under the clearly 
erroneous standard, pursuant to subsection (5), and an 
agency’s exercise of discretion is reviewed under the 
arbitrary and capricious standard, pursuant to subsection 
(6).  Mixed questions of l aw and fact are reviewed under 
the clearly erroneous standard because the conclusion is 
dependent upon the facts and circumstances of the  
particular case.

13 B. Statutory interpretation  
“The interpretation of a statute is a question of law 
which this court reviews de novo.”  State v. Thompson , 150 
Hawaiʻi 262, 266, 500 P.3d 447, 451 (2021) (citing State v. 
Ruggiero , 114 Hawaiʻi 227, 231, 160 P.3d 703, 707 (2007)) . 
First, the fundamental starting point for statutory 
interpretation is the language of the statute itself.  
Second, where the statutory language is plain and 
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain 
and obvious meaning.  Third, implicit in the task of 
statutory construction is our foremost obligation to 
ascertain and give effect to the intention of the 
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the 
language contained in the statute itself.

P.3d 118, 130 (2015)  (quoting  Haw. State Tchrs. Ass’n v.  
Abercrombie , 126 Hawaiʻi 318, 320, 271 P.3d 613, 615 (2012)).  
III.  DISCUSSION  
A. The uses specifically not permitted by HRS § 205 -4.5(a)(6) 
cannot be authorized by special use permit.  
The state -level land use system is set out in HRS 
chapter 205.  Land in Hawaiʻi is divided into four land use 
districts: urban, rural, agricultural, and conservation.  HRS 
§ 205-2(a) (2001).  Agricultural lands are further classified by 
soil productivity level from “A” to “E,” with class A denoting 
the highest productivity level and class E denoting the lowest.   
Neighborhood Bd. No. 24 (Waianae Coast) v. State Land Use 
Comm’n, 64 Haw. 265, 267  n.2, 639 P.2d 1097,  1099 n.2 (1982).  
Under HRS § 205-4.5, agricultural districts are restricted to *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
14 certain uses, which depend on the productivity rating.   
Subsection (a) of  HRS § 205-4.5 provides that class A and B 
agricultural lands “ shall be restricted to the following 
permitted uses  . . . .”  Subsection (a) then enumerates 
permitted uses, such as “(1) [c] ultivation of crops, including 
crops for bioenergy, flowers, vegetables, foliage, fruits, 
forage, and timber; ” and “(2) [g]ame and fish propagation  
. . . .”  At issue h ere is the sixth enumerated use: “ (6) 
[p]ublic and private open area types of recreational uses, 
including day camps, picnic grounds, parks, and riding stables, 
but not including  dragstrips, airports, drive -in theaters, golf 
courses, golf driving ranges , country clubs, and overnight camps  
. . . .”  (Emphasis added.)  
Next, subsection (b) provides: “ Uses not expressly 
permitted in subsection (a) shall be prohibited, except the uses 
permitted as provided in sections 205 -6 [special permits] and 
205-8 [nonconfor ming uses] .  . . .” 
HRS § 205-6 sets forth the law on special use permits.  
It provides: “t he county planning commission may permit certain 
unusual and reasonable uses  within agricultural and rural 
districts other than those for which the district is 
classified.”  HRS § 205-6(a) (emphasis added).  Further, “[t] he 
county planning commission may, under such protective 
restrictions as may be deemed necessary, permit the desired use, *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
15 but only when the use would promote the effectiveness and 
objectives of this chapter . . . .”  HRS § 205 -6(c) (emphasis 
added).   
The question before this court is whether the  public 
and private open area types of  recreational uses explicitly not 
permitted in HRS § 205 -4.5(a)(6) – dragstrips, airports, drive -
in theaters, golf cou rses, golf driving ranges , country clubs, 
and overnight camps  – can be permitted by special use permit 
under HRS §§ 205-4.5(b) and 205-6.   
“[T]he fundamental starting point for statutory 
interpretation is the language of the statute itself . . . . 
[O]ur foremost obligation [is] to ascertain and give effect to 
the intention of the legislature, which is to be obtained 
primarily from the language contained in the statute itself. ”  
Invs. Equity Life Holding Co. , 135 Hawaiʻi at 61, 346 P.3d at 130 
(quoting  Abercrombie , 126 Hawaiʻi at 320, 271 P.3d at 615).  
Special use permits are available only for “unusual 
and reasonable uses” and “only when the use would promote the 
effectiveness and objectives of this chapter.”  HRS § 205-6(a) 
and (c).   HRS § 205-4.5(a)(6) specifically lists uses that are 
not permitted in class A and B  agricultural district  land.  By 
explicitly banning certain uses in HRS § 205-4.5(a)(6), the 
legislature indicated those uses on class A and B agricultural 
land are inherently not reason able.  Therefore, a plain reading *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
16 of the text demonstrates  that special use permits are 
unavailable to authorize  the public and private recreational 
uses of “dragstrips, airports, drive -in theaters, golf courses, 
golf driving ranges, country clubs, and ove rnight camps” because 
those are not reasonable uses on class A and B agricultural 
land.   
Further, t he statutory rule against superfluity 
establishes  that special use permits are unavailable for  the 
public and private recreational uses of  “dragstrips, airp orts, 
drive-in theaters, golf courses, golf driving ranges, country 
clubs, and overnight camps” on class A and B agricultural land.  
“It is a cardinal rule of statutory construction that courts are 
bound to give effect to all parts of a statute, and that no 
clause, sentence, or word shall be construed as superfluous.”   
State v. Bautista , 86 Hawaiʻi 207, 213, 948 P.2d 1048, 1054 
(1997) (quoting State v. Ganal , 81 Hawai‘i 358, 372, 917 P.2d 
370, 384 (1996) ).  If special use permits were available for the 
explicitly not permitted uses listed in HRS § 205-4.5(a)(6), HRS 
§ 205-4.5(a)(6)’s clause  banning such uses would be superfluous.  
Therefore, to give effect to HRS § 205-4.5(a)(6)’s clause 
excluding the public and private recreational uses of 
“dragstrips, air ports, drive -in theaters, golf courses, golf 
driving ranges, country clubs, and overnight camps” from *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
17 permitted uses  on class A and B agricultural land , such uses 
cannot be permitted by special use permit.  
Another principle of statutory interpretation confirms 
that HRS § 205-4.5(a)(6)’s specific list of not permitted uses 
controls over the general default rule and special use permit 
exception of HRS § 205-4.5(b).   
It is the generally accepted rule of statutory construction 
that unless a legislative int ention to the contrary clearly 
appears, special or particular provisions control over 
general provisions, terms or expressions.  . . . It is also 
elementary that specific provisions must be given effect 
notwithstanding the general provisions are broad enoug h to 
include the subject to which the specific provisions 
relate. 
 
In re R Child. , 145 Hawai‘i 477, 485, 454 P.3d 418, 426 (2019)  
(quoting State v. Coney , 45 Haw. 650, 662, 372 P.2d 348, 354 
(1962), overruled on other grounds by  City and C nty. of Honolulu 
v. Bonded Inv. Co.,  54 Haw. 385, 507 P.2d 1084 (1973) ).  HRS 
§ 205-4.5(a)(6)’s express list of not permitted uses is more 
specific than HRS § 205-4.5(b)’s default prohibition and general 
special use permit exception.  As such, HRS § 205-4.5(a)(6)’s 
express list of not permitted uses control s.   
A closer examination  of HRS § 205-6 reinforces that 
special use permits are unavailable for the public and private 
recreational uses of “dragstrips, airports, drive -in theaters, 
golf courses, golf driving ranges, country clubs, and overnight 
camps” on class A and B agricultural land .  Using class A and B 
agricultural land for such uses of “dragstrips, airports, drive -*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
18 in theaters, golf cour ses, golf driving ranges, country clubs, 
and overnight camps” does not appear to promote the objectives 
of HRS chapter 205 , which is required by HRS § 205-6(c) to 
qualify for a special use permit.  See HRS § 205-6(c) (“The 
county planning commission may, under such protective 
restrictions as may be deemed necessary, permit the desired use, 
but only when the use would promote the  effectiveness and 
objectives of this chapter  . . . .” (emphasis added)).   
The “overarching p urpose” of HRS chapter 205 is to 
“protect and conserve natural resources and  foster intelligent, 
effective, and orderly land allocation and development .”  Kaua‘i 
Springs, Inc.  v. Planning Comm’n of Cnty . of Kaua‘i, 133 Hawai‘i 
141, 169, 324 P.3d 951, 979 (2014) (quoting Curtis v. Bd. of 
Appeals, Cnty. of Haw. , 90 Hawai‘i 384, 396, 978 P.2d 822, 834  
(1999)).  Relevant here, HRS chapter 205  is intended  in part to 
protect agricultural land for agricultural use.  See HRS § 205-
2(a)(3) (“In the establishment of  the boundaries of  agricultural 
districts the greatest possible protection shall be  given to 
those lands with a high capacity for intensive  cultivation[.]" ); 
Curtis, 90 Hawai‘i at 396, 978 P.2d at 834 (noting that one of 
the purposes of HRS chapter 205 is to “[u]tilize the land 
resources in an  intelligent, effective manner based upon the 
capabilities and characteristics of the soil  and the needs of 
the economy”  (emphasis added)  (quoting H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
19 395, in 1961 House Journal, at 855 –56)).  Moreover, the 
legislature declared that  “the people of Hawaii have a 
substantial interest in the health and sustainability of 
agriculture as an industry in the State.   There is a compelling 
state interest in conserving the State's agricultural land 
resource base and assuring the long -term availability of 
agricultural lands for agricultural use  . . . .”  HRS § 205-41 
(2017).  HRS § 205-41 was enacted pursuant to article XI, 
section 3 of the  Hawaiʻi Constitution, which enshrines the 
protection of agricultural l ands: “The State shall conserve and 
protect agricultural lands, promote diversified agriculture, 
increase agricultural self -sufficiency and assure the 
availability of agriculturally suitable lands. ”   
Thus, in addition to the foregoing reasons, it appears 
special use permit s cannot authorize  the public and private  
recreational uses of “dragstrips, airports, drive -in theaters, 
golf courses, golf driving ranges, country clubs, and overnight 
camps” on class A and B agricultural land, because these uses of 
class A and B agricultural land do not appear to promote the 
objectives of chapter 205, as required by HRS § 205-6(c).  
In sum, HRS §§ 205-4.5(a)(6) and  205-6 are clear: the 
“public and private open area types of recreational uses ” of 
“dragstrips, airports , drive-in theaters, golf courses, golf 
driving ranges, country clubs, and overnight camps ” are not *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
20 permitted on class A and B agricultural land, and cannot be 
permitted by special use permit.5  
B. A district boundary amendment is required for the 
foundation’ s proposed campground .  
Public and private r ecreational uses of “dragstrips, 
airports, drive -in theaters, golf courses, golf driving ranges, 
country clubs, and overnight camps ” are not permitted uses on 
class A and B rated agricultural land and cannot be subject to a 
special use permit.  (Emphasis added.)   
The foundation’s proposed campground  is clearly an 
“overnight camp” within the meaning of HRS § 205-4.5(a)(6).  The 
LUC found that “ Hoʻomoana plans to develop the  Project as an 
overnight  campground  . . . The name of the Project is  Kauaula 
Campground. ”6  The campground project is intended for 
recreational use by commercial campers, in addition to use by 
unhoused campers.   Because the campground project includes  a 
                     
5  This opinion does not construe “overnight  accommodations” within the 
meaning of HRS § 205-2(d)(12), relating to agricultural tourism activities, 
because this issue was not raised on certiorari, except briefly by the 
foundation in the separate context of arguing Mahaʻulepu v. Land Use 
Commission, 71 Haw. 332, 790 P.2d 906 (1990 ), superseded by statute , 2005 
Haw. Sess. Laws Act 205, §§  2-3 at 669 -71, was not abrogated.  
  
6  In its answering briefs before the ICA, the foundation argued the 
record is inadequate because it does not include the special use permit 
application.  The special use permit application is not in the record, though 
the homeowners appear to have attached excerpts of the special permit 
application as an exhibit .  The foundation did not raise the issue on 
certiorari.  Given our disp osition in this case – that the special use permit 
procedure is not available for overnight camps on class A and B rated 
agricultural district land – the fact that the special use permit is not in 
the record is inconsequential.  Throughout its briefing, th e foundation 
admitted it is “seeking a special use permit for the operation of an 
overnight campground.”  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
21 recreational use of an overnight camp,  the project cannot be 
authorized by special use permit.  Accordingly, the proposed 
campground requires a district boundary amendment to change the 
land use classification to one where recreational overnight 
camps are permitted.  See generally  HRS § 205-3.1 (2005).  
C. Mahaʻulepu v. Land Use Commission  is overruled .  
Mahaʻulepu v. Land Use Comm ission, 71 Haw. 332, 790 
P.2d 906 (1990) , superseded by statute , 2005 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 
205, §§ 2-3 at 669 -71, rests on flawed statutory analysis and 
was incorrectly decided .   
“[A] court should not overrule its earlier decisions 
unless the most cogent reasons  and inescapable logic 
require it.”  Dairy Rd. Partners v. Island Ins. Co.,  92 
Hawai‘i 398, 421, 992 P.2d 93, 116 (2000) (quoting State v. 
Stocker, 90 Hawai‘i 85, 95, 976 P.2d 399, 409 (1999)). 
Nevertheless, “there is no necessity or sound  legal reason 
to perpetuate an error under the doctrine of stare 
decisis.”  State v. Garcia , 96 Hawai‘i 200, 206, 29 P.3d 
919, 925 (2001) (quoting Robinson v. Ariyoshi , 65 Haw. 641, 
653 n.10, 658 P.2d 287, 297 n.10 (1982)).  The doctrine is  
“subordinate to legal reasons and justice and we should not 
be unduly hesitant to  overrule a former decision when to do 
so would bring abo ut what is considered  manifest justice.”   
Ariyoshi , 65 Haw. at 653 n.10, 658 P.2d at 297 n.10 
(quoting  McBryde Sugar Co. v. Robinson , 54 Haw. 174, 180, 
504 P.2d 1330, 1335 (1973)).   
 
State v. Chang , 144 Hawai‘i 535, 553, 445 P.3d 116, 134 (2019).   
Mahaʻulepu is overruled because inescapable logic and the cogent 
reasons enumerated above require it.  The statutory analysis in 
Mahaʻulepu is flawed, and “there is no necessity or sound  legal 
reason to perpetuate an error under the doctrine of stare 
decisis.”  Garcia, 96 Hawai‘i at 206, 29 P.3d at 925.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
22 Mahaʻulepu held that golf courses on class A and B 
agricultural land can be authorized by special use permit under 
HRS §§ 205-4.5(b) and 205-6, despite the fact that golf courses 
are not a permitted use on class B agricultural land under HRS 
§ 205-4.5(a)(6).  Mahaʻulepu, 71 Haw. at 336–37, 790 P.2d at 908-
09.  The opinion did not reconcile  HRS § 205-4.5(a)(6)’s list of 
explicitly  not permitted uses with HRS § 205-4.5(b)’s and HRS 
§ 205-6’s special use permit provisions.  Instead, t he opinion 
analyzed the effect of Act 298 - the 1985 amendment to HRS 
§ 205-2 relating to golf courses  - on HRS § 205-4.5(b).  Id. at 
337-38, 790 P.2d at 909-10.  Because Mahaʻulepu failed to engage 
with the pla in language of HRS § 205-4.5(a)(6) prohibiting 
certain uses in class A and B agricultural districts , ignored 
principles of statutory interpretation, and failed to  effectuate 
the purpose of the statutory scheme , it is overruled.7  
IV. CONCLUSION  
The specific exclusion of overnight camps from 
permitted uses in HRS § 205-4.5(a)(6) means that the public and 
private recreational use of overnight camps is not permitted , 
even by special use permit,  on class A and B agricultural 
district  land.  According ly, the foundation’s proposed 
                     
7  The LUC’s contention that the foundation waived its argument regarding 
Mahaʻulepu will not be addressed in light of this decision over ruling 
Mahaʻulepu. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
23 campground project requires a district boundary amendment.  
Further, Mahaʻulepu v. Land Use Comm ission, 71 Haw. 332, 790 P.2d 
906 (1990), superseded by statute , 2005 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 205, 
§§ 2-3 at 669 -71, was incorrectly d ecided and is overruled.  
Accordingly, we reverse the ICA’s June 24, 2022
