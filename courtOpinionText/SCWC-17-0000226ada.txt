 and/or § 707-711(1)(b),2 via an August 11, 2015 indictment in the 
Family Court of the First Circuit (“family court”) .3  On January 
12, 2017, a jury found Williams guilty of the lesser included 
offense of assault in the third degree, in violation of HRS § 
707-712.4  On March 28, 2017, the family court5 entered its final 
judgment, sentencing Williams to one year of probation. 
                         
2  The indictment read:  
 
On or about September 21, 2014 to and including September 
22, 2014, in the City and County of Honolulu, State of 
Hawaiʻi, PATRICK WILLIAMS, being the parent or guardian or 
any other person having legal or physical custody of [minor 
son], did intentionally or knowingly cause substantial 
bodily injury to [minor child], and/or did recklessly cause 
substantial bodily injury to [minor son], a person less 
than eighteen years of age, thereby committing the offense 
of Assault in the Second Degree, in violation of Section 
707-711(1)(a) and/or Section 707 -711(1)(b) of the Hawaiʻi 
Revised Statutes.   
 
 
3  The parties and the Intermediate Court of Appeals (“ICA”) refer to the 
trial court as the “circuit court,” but the indictment and proceedings were 
in the family court.  At all times pertinent to this case (as well as now), 
the family court had exclusive or iginal jurisdiction “[t]o try any offense 
committed against a child by the child’s parent or guardian or by any other 
person having the child’s legal or physical custody” pursuant to  
HRS § 571- 14(a)(1) (2018).  
 
4  HRS § 707- 712 (2014) states:  
 
Assault in the third degree.   (1) A person commits the 
offense of assault in the third degree if the person:  
     (a)  Intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes 
bodily injury to another person; or  
     (b)  Negligently causes bodily injury to another 
person with  a dangerous instrument.  
     (2)  Assault in the third degree is a misdemeanor 
unless committed in a fight or scuffle entered into by 
mutual consent, in which case it is a petty misdemeanor.  
 
 The jury instruction for the lesser included offense of Assault in the 
Third Degree, the charge on which Williams was found guilty, read as follows:  
 ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     *** 
 
3 
  Williams appealed the family court’s final judgment to the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals (“ICA”), arguing the family court 
plainly erred by failing to strike 
certain improper opening 
statements made by the deputy prosecuting attorney and by 
admitting certain x- rays into evidence without the necessary 
                                                                              
(. . .continued)  
If and only if you find the defendant not guilty of 
the offense of Assault in the Second Degree, or you are 
unable to reach a unanimous verdict as to this offense, 
then you must consider whether the defendant is guilty or 
not guilty of the included offense of Assault in the Third 
Degree.  
A person commits the offense of Assault in the Third 
Degree if he intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes 
bodily injury to another person.  
There are four material elements of the offense of 
Assault in the Third Degree, each of which the prosecution  
must prove beyond a reasonable doubt.  
These four elements are:  
1. That, on or about September 21, 2014, to and 
including September 22, 2014, in the City and County of 
Honolulu, the defendant, Patrick Williams, was the parent, 
or guardian, or any other person having legal or physical 
custody of [minor son]; and  
2. That the defendant, Patrick Williams, knew or 
reasonably should have known that [minor son] was less than 
eighteen years of age; and  
 
3. That, on or about September 21, 2014, to and 
including September 22, 2014, the defendant, Patrick 
Williams, caused bodily injury to [minor son]; and  
 
4. That the defendant, Patrick Williams, did so 
intentionally, knowingly or recklessly.

 foundation.  Williams also argued there was insufficient 
evidence to sustain his conviction.  
In its summary disposition o rder (“SDO”),  the ICA concluded 
the points of error alleged by Williams lacked merit.  The ICA 
ruled: (1) although the deputy prosecuting attorney’s comments 
in his opening statement were improper, the family court had 
instructed the jury to re
frain from considering the comments a s 
evidence so, therefore, the error was harmless; (2) there was no 
reasonable possibility that any error in admitting 
the contested 
x-rays into evidence contributed to Williams’s conviction; and 
(3) viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the 
State, there was sufficient evidence that Williams at least 
recklessly caused minor son to suffer bodily injury.  See  State 
v. Williams, No. CAAP-17-0000 226, at 4 –6 (App. June 15, 2018) 
(SDO).  The ICA then entered its judgment on appeal affirming 
the family court’s  final judgment. 
Williams’s  certiorari application asks that this court 
address the three issues he had presented to the ICA: 
Whether the ICA gravely erred in holding that: (1) the 
prosecutor’s improper comments constituted harmless error; 
(2) the [family] court did not err in admitting the x -rays 
into evidence without the improper [sic] foundation; and 
(3) there was sufficient evidence to sustain Williams’s 
conviction.  
 
We hold that Williams’s  conviction on the charge of assault 
in the third degree must be vacated because the deputy ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     *** 
 
5 
 prosecut
ing attorney’s  elicitation of evidence regarding Child 
Welfare Services involvement in violation of a defense motion in 
limine was improper and not harmless beyond a rea sonable doubt.   
As we set aside the conviction, we also address the 
evidentiary foundation issue regarding the x- rays not addressed 
by the ICA, and hold there was insufficient foundation for 
admission of the contested x-rays into  evidence because the 
physician through whom the x- rays were introduced was not a 
custodian or “other qualified witness” able to lay a foundation 
pursuant to Hawaiʻi Rules of Evidence (“HRE”)  Rule 803(b)(6) 
(2002).  We also hold, however, that Williams’s conviction  on 
the charge of assault in the third degree was  supported by  
substantial evidence.   
Accordingly, we vacate the family court’s March 28, 2017 
final judgment as well as the ICA’s  September 25, 2018 judgment 
on appeal and remand this case to the family court for further 
proceedings consistent with this opinion
. 
II.  Background 
A. Child Welfare Services Issue 
 In his January 3, 2017 motion in limine, Williams included
a request to exclude “[a ]ny reference to an investigation and 
case by the Child Welfare Services, Depar tment of Human 
Services, State of Hawai[
ʻ]i and any legal issues stemm ing from 
 ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***

 said investigati on and case” as item 2.c.  At the January 9, 
2017 hearing on Williams’s  motions in limine, the family court 
granted this  request.  
Williams’s jury trial took place on January 9, 11, and 12, 
2017.  Before
 the parties’ opening statements, the  family court 
explained, “Please remember that what the attorneys say is not 
evidence.  What actually counts is the sworn testimony of the 
witnesses and the ex hibits or other things that are received as 
evidence.” 
During opening statements  on January 9 , the deputy  
 
prosecuting attorney stated:  
 
[Y]ou will find out that [minor son] is subsequently 
transferred to another family and reunited with his mother.   
 
 You’ll meet Detective Melvin Raquedan, who assists 
with the transfer of custody.  You’ll also meet social 
worker Robert Asato, who aids in the transfer from Tripler 
Army Medical Center after [minor son] is treated and 
released and how he is ultimately reunited down the road 
with his mother.  
 
Williams did not 
raise a specific objection to these statements.  
On January 11,  Wiliams’ s deputy public defender requested 
an offer of proof regarding what testimony the deputy 
prosecuting attorney expected to elicit from witnesses Melvin 
Raquedan of the Honolulu Police Department (“Detective 
Raquedan”) and social worker Robert Asato.   The deputy 
prosecuting attorney indicated that both witnesses were being 
called to establish “a material element” of “custody of the *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
7 child, who was formerly or solely in the defendant’s care, and 
the transfer out of that care.”   After the deputy public 
defender objected to any evidence regarding “car e out of Mr. 
Williams’ hands,”  the deputy prosecuting attorney stated that he 
would not “get into what happened to the child.  It’s 
essentially to establish the parent, guardianship care and 
custody.”  
The next day, the State called Detective Raquedan as a 
witness.  During his
 direct examination, the following exchanged 
occurred: 
[DEPUTY PROSECUTING ATTORNEY] : And in order to explain the 
next steps you took, what did dispatch request your 
assistance with?  
[WITNESS] : Assist in taking police custody of a minor. 
[DEPUTY PUBLIC DEFENDER]: Objection, Your Honor. Violates 
the motion. [6]
 
THE COURT: No speaking objections. At the bench please. 
(The following proceedings had at the bench:)  
THE COURT: All right. So the objection is violates the 
motions in limine?  
[DEPUTY PUBLIC DEFENDER]: Yes, Your  Honor. The concern 
raised yesterday on record.  
THE COURT: All right. At the end of the day in terms of 
what was discussed at court, I believe I only permitted 
testimony with respect to what the status of the child and 
relative to the defendant having care and custody of the 
6This was presumably the granted motion in limine prohibiting “[a]ny 
reference to an investigation and case by the Child Welfare Services, 
Department of Human Services, State of Hawai[ ʻ]i and any legal issues stemming
from said investigation and case ,” as well as the discussions that  had taken 
place the day before regarding the nature of the evidence to be elicited.   ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     *** 
 
8 
 child versus transfer of custody. I believe that was 
precluded. So where do you intend to go with this?  
 
[DEPUTY PROSECUTING ATTORNEY]
: Yes. The prosecution intends 
to show that in order to have the transfer of custody from 
the father ’s care to the State, there needs to be a two -
party assistance, and he responded to that in order to work 
with Mr. Asato. That is what he was given via dispatch and 
that’s all he’ s going to testify to with respect to 
assisting in the transfer of the custody.  
 
THE COURT: Okay.  
 
[DEPUTY PROSECUTING ATTORNEY]:
 But that’
s what it is. And 
the State does not intend to get into the details anywhere. 
But he was the responding officer.  
 
THE COURT: All right. [DEPUTY PUBLIC DEFENDER].  
 
[DEPUTY PUBLIC DEFENDER]:
 Your Honor, I think that’ s highly 
prejudicial --
 the fact that two witnesses  are needed to 
establish one of the elements. I think the route that the 
State is taking is unnecessary and it sheds Mr. Williams in 
a different light than it would otherwise need to do to 
establish that same element. I think they can do it in a 
multiple number of other ways, and I think it still does 
violate. I don’ t think – -  
 
THE COURT: All right.  
 
[DEPUTY PROSECUTING ATTORNEY]:
 With respect to the 
establishment, Detective Raquedan is expected to testify 
that he actually completed and filled out the protective 
custody form. On that form 
[minor son] is known by another 
name. So he is a necessary material witness to establish 
that this child was present. And he as well as Robert Asato 
signed the protective custody –-  
 
. . . . 
 
THE COURT:
 So why is it that you can’ t simply ask the 
witness that as part of his duties, did he come into 
contact with these individuals --  the complainant, and 
during the course of his investigation or  what he did, he 
ascertained defendant as the parent?  
 
[DEPUTY PROSECUTING ATTORNEY]:
 Okay. And the State will 
just proceed that way.  
 
THE COURT: That would essentially permit you to have him 
testimony [sic] to things that are within his knowledge but 
without necessarily going beyond  what’s necessary to 
establish the elements of the offense. Because what 
happened with the child happened, which really has no ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     *** 
 
9 
 relevance. And while the defense is claiming t
hat it is 
highly prejudicial, I’m not so sure that’ s the case.  
 
[DEPUTY PROSECUTING ATTORNEY] : I’ll proceed. I’ ll move on. 
 
THE COURT: The objection’ s sustained. And you may proceed 
as I’ve indicated.[7]
  
 
[DEPUTY PROSECUTING ATTORNEY]: Understood. Thanks.  
 
[DEPUTY PUBLIC DEFENDER]: Thank you, Your Honor.  
 
. . . . 
 
[DEPUTY PROSECUTING ATTORNEY] : And did you ultimately work 
in tandem with Mr. Asato on behalf of the Department of 
Human Services?  
 
[WITNESS]:  Yes.  
 
[DEPUTY PUBLIC DEFENDER]: Objection, Your Honor.  
 
THE COURT: Sustained. Court will strike that last response. 
You will not consider it for any purpose whatsoever, ladies 
and gentlemen.  
 
 Although the family  court sustained the deputy public 
defender’s objection and struck Detective Raquedan’s reference 
to the “Department of Human Services,” of which Child Welfare 
Services is a part, the State later called social worker Robert 
Asato to testify, and elicited the following evidence:  
[DEPUTY PROSECUTING ATTORNEY] : Good morning, sir. Can you 
please tell us  your name and occupation for the record.  
 
[WITNESS] : Robert Jason Asato. I’m an investigative  
social worker, Child Welfare Services . 
 
[DEPUTY PUBLIC DEFENDER]: Objection, Your Honor . 
 
THE COURT:
 Overruled. 
 
                         
7  Although the family court sustained the objection, it did not strike 
the response that prompted the objection, that Detective Raquedan had been 
requested by dispatch to  “[a]ssist in taking police custody of a minor.”  ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     *** 
 
10 
 [DEPUTY PROSECUTING ATTORNEY] : You can respond. I ’m sorry. 
Tell us your  name and occupation again.  
 
[WITNESS] : Robert Jason Asato. Investigative social  
worker, Child Welfare Services.  
 
[DEPUTY PROSECUTING ATTORNEY] : Thank you. And Mr. Asato, I 
just have several  questions for you. On September 24th, 
2014, were you  involved or did you co
me across [minor son]? 
 
[WITNESS] : Yes. 
 
[DEPUTY PROSECUTING ATTORNEY] : And with respect to [minor 
son], were you  able -- during the course of your 
investigation, able to  determine who was the sole caretaker 
of [minor son]  on that date?  
 
[WITNESS] : Yes. 
 
[DEPUTY PROSECUTING ATTORNEY] : And the sole caretaker 
according to your  investigation --  would it be fair to say 
was his father,  Patrick Williams?  
 
[WITNESS]: 
 Yes.  
 
[DEPUTY PROSECUTING ATTORNEY] :  
And just to clarify, 
September 24th 2014, was that the first day that you were 
assigned and came across [minor son]?  
 
[WITNESS] :  Yes. 
 
 In addition, during the testimony of Dr. Jennifer Doerrige 
(“Dr. Doerrige”) , whose testimony is further discussed in the 
next section, the deputy prosecuting attorney 
asked, “[D]id you 
alert authorities after treating [minor son] ,” to which Dr. 
Doerrige responded,  “Yes. CPS was contacted. That’s Child 
Protective Services.”8 
 
  
                         
8  Although the official term is “Child Welfare Services,” it appears 
“Child Protective Services” or “CPS” is still often used in common parlance.  ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     *** 
 
11 
 B. Other Trial Evidence Relevant to Issues on Certiorari 
The trial also included the following evidence relevant to 
the issues on certiorari.   
1. Testimony of Nurse Santana 
Around 9:30 a.m. on September 22, 2014, Williams brought 
minor son to Wahiawa General Hospital.  That day happened to be 
minor son’s second birthday.   
Nurse Santana, who triaged minor son  upon his arrival at 
the hospital, testified she saw an “obvious deformity” in minor 
son’s left femur and that minor son
 appeared distressed.   
Williams told her he saw minor son jump off the bed the night 
before around 10:30 p.m. and that 
minor son’s leg looked more 
swollen that morning.  At around 10:03 a.m., Nurse Santana 
administered fentanyl,
 a drug which can cause sleepiness and a 
dulling of the senses,  to minor son.   
2. Testimony of Nurse Blakey 
 Nurse Blakey then assessed minor son  at 10:30 a.m. and 
noted that he was alert and comfortable lying in bed, with 
Williams at his bedside, and exhibited “no apparent distress” 
after Nurse Santana had administered fentanyl.  Because minor 
son’s condition had stabilized , at around noon, Nurse Blakey 
assisted in discharging him.  Minor son then went to Tripler 
Army Medical Center (“Tripler”)  for further treatment.  ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     *** 
 
12 
 3. Testimony of Dr. Doerrige 
 Dr. Doerrige was the emergency room physician who treated 
minor son at Wahiawa General Hospital on September 22, 2014.  
She conducted a basic physical examination of minor son, and 
noticed a deformity in 
his left leg with soft tissue swelling.   
After discovering an “obvious” left femur fracture, she ordered 
x-rays and a whole body x- ray called a babygram.  Dr. Doerrige 
diagnosed minor son with a left transverse slightly angulated 
significantly displaced fracture of the left femur as well as 
some soft tissue swelling
 at the site of the fracture.      
Dr. Doerrige also opined that,  had minor son not been 
treated, the fracture could have caused serious permanent 
disfigurement or protracted loss or impairment of the function 
of his left leg, and that  one leg would have been significantly 
shorter than the other, which would have prevented minor son  
from running, jumping, hopping, and skipping.  Dr. Doerrige 
further opined that minor son’s  injury was not consistent with 
jumping and falling off of a bed onto a carpeted floor.   She 
testified that the femur is a very strong bone that is difficult 
to break.  She testified: 
The story wasn’t very consistent because, one, most kids   
. . . learn to jump between ages of 24 months and 36 
months.  So the jumping aspect was a little suspect.  He 
might be advanced for his age.  And then the fact that it 
probably would  be greater force than that.  Not like a two -
story bed, but a two -story building that would have that 
kind of force to generate that kind of fracture.  ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     *** 
 
13 
  
Dr. Doerrige also testified that femur fr actures are notoriously 
painful and that most children would be cryi ng; in a great deal 
of distress; and unable to walk, stand, or sleep through the 
night.  
Dr. Doerrige also related that while she treated minor son 
for his injury, Williams was apathetic,  “[v]ery aloof and was 
off to the side.  W as texting on his cell phone.”   She also 
observed Williams giving minor son fist bumps when minor son was 
crying after coming back from being x-rayed.   
 Dr. Doerrige then  testified State’s E xhibits 10, 11, and 12 
showed differing views of a femur fracture, the femur fracture 
in those exhibits was  consistent with her diagnosis and 
examination of minor son , and the x-rays were  a “fair and 
accurate depiction[] . . . of the left femur fracture sustained 
by [minor son].”  Dr. Doerrige testified the upper left corner 
of the x-rays noted minor son ’s name.   When the State attempted 
to move these exhibits into evidence, however, the family court 
sustained the defense’s objection based on lack of foundation, 
and these x- rays were never received in evidence.  
 Although Dr. Doerrige had testified  she conta cted “Child 
Protective Services ” as noted earlier, during cross- examination 
by the deputy public defender, she al so testified she could n ot 
rule out accidental trauma.  ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     *** 
 
14 
  4.  Testimony of Dr. Polk 
 Dr. Norman Polk (“Dr. Polk”)  served as  minor son’s  
diagnostic radiologist at Wahiawa General Hospital.  Dr. Polk 
had begun practicing medicine in Hawai ʻi during his residency at 
Tripler in 1975, where he worked for about four years.  
Dr. Polk was on duty as a radiologist at Wahiawa General 
Hospital on September 22, 2014.  His involvement in minor son’s 
care consisted of viewing radiographs taken of minor son 
and 
speaking with Dr. Doerrige regarding his findings.  He opined 
that minor son had a left femur mid-shaft fracture
 that was 
slightly angulated anteriorly.   Dr. Polk also testified 
there 
was soft tissue swelling, but the babygram did not reveal any 
prior fractures.   
 After being stabilized at Wahiawa General Hospital , minor 
son had been taken to Tripler  for treatment.  The deputy 
prosecuting attorney then began asking Dr. Polk whether he 
previously had the opportunity to view several x-ray images 
apparently taken at Tripler before coming to court that day.  
Dr. Polk responded that he had seen “the post -treated injury 
when [minor son] was at Tripler. ”  The deputy prosecuting 
attorney then asked Dr. Polk whether in  his past experience, he 
had viewed x-ray images from Tripler.  Dr. Polk then responded ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     *** 
 
15 
 in the affirmative to 
this question as well as another question 
regarding whether he relied on images from other hospitals. 
The deputy prosecuting attorney then handed St ate’s Exhibit 
3 for identification to Dr. Polk and asked him to verify that 
the name, date of birth, and date of the imag e was “in line” 
with the x-rays he had previously reviewed regarding minor  son.  
Dr. Polk agreed that “[t]hey appear[ed] to correlate.”   
Dr. Polk then began testifying as to what State’s Exhibit 3 
for identification showed 
even before it was received in 
evidence.  In summary, he described State’s E xhibit 3 as showing 
a left femur after it had been realigned.   Although Dr. Polk did 
not testify that the image was of minor son’s left femur, he 
stated it “look[ed] [like a] fair an d accurate” depiction of 
minor son’s fracture.  
The deputy prosecuting attorney then began ask ing about 
another Tripler x- ray, a lateral view x- ray of a left femur that 
had been realigned, marked as State’s Exhibit 4.  The deputy 
public defender then objected that Dr. Polk had been testifying 
regarding exhibits yet to be received in evidence, and also 
asserted that no proper foundation had been laid for the 
admission of the x- rays.  The family court disagreed and 
admitted State’s Exhibit 3 into evidenc e.  The deputy public ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     *** 
 
16 
 defender raised a running objection to the State’s other 
exhibits.  
Dr. Polk then 
further explained what was depicted in 
State’s Exhibit 3:  
For the sake of discussion, this is the femur,  or 
thigh bone is what people know it as.  And this is the  
fracture here, the mid -portion.  And these two pieces of  
bone have been separated.  And if there’s no fracture the  
white line would be contiguous all the way through.  The 
knee doesn’t have any obvious fracture.  The tibia and  
fibula, which are  the lower leg bones, don’t show any  
obvious fracture.  This is the hip.  There’s no  
displacement or fracture up here.  Basically the fracture  
involves the midshaft.  And now it looks like it’s well  
aligned for orthopedic purposes on this film.    
 
The white lines out here are the plaster cast.   And 
the swelling is -- it’s basically adjacent to the  area of 
the fractures. You don’t see the same sort of  swelling down 
below. 
  
After foundational questions were asked similar to those 
asked of State’s Exhibit 3, State’s E xhibit 4  was also admitted 
into evidence.   
 Dr. Polk then also opined that minor son’s injury would be 
consistent with jumping and falling off of a bed only “[i]f the 
bed was on a second story of a building.”   He explained as 
follows:  
Children’s bones are unlike old people[’s bones] . . . .  
Children[’s] . . . bones tend to bend. . . .  So it takes a 
lot of force to take a young kid’s leg -- and the femur is 
. . . one of the largest and strongest bones in the body -- 
to take it and actually break it in two pieces, snap it in 
two and to displace it, . . .  that’s a lot of force.   
 
He also testified that a broken femur in a two- year-old is a 
“really unusual” injury, and is often related to non -accidental ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     *** 
 
17 
 trauma, such as an automobile 
accident,  falling down the stairs, 
or blunt force trauma.   
 5.  Testimony of Dr. Happy 
 Christopher Happy, M.D. (“Dr. Happy”) , the chief medical 
examiner for the City and County of Honolulu, testified for the 
defense.  Dr. Happy testified he had “review[ ed] . . . various 
X-ray images in [minor son ’s] case,” and opined that a toddler 
could sustain a femur fracture from jumping and falling off of a 
bed, even if jumping onto a carpeted surface.  He stated  the 
vast majority of femur fractures are accidental.  
C. Appeal to the ICA and Application for Writ of Certiorari 
 On appeal to the ICA, Williams presented three points of 
error: 
A. The [family] court plainly erred in failing to strike 
improper statements made by the prosecutor in opening 
statement.  
 
. . . .  
 
B. The [family] court erred in admitting the X -rays[9] 
into evidence without the necessary foundation .
 
 
. . . .  
 
C. There was insufficient evidence to sustain Williams’s 
conviction of Assault in the Third Degree.  
 
The ICA rejected the  challenges .  As to the first issue, 
the ICA applied a plain error analysis on the grounds that 
                         
9  In his opening brief, Williams took issue with the admis sion of State’s 
Exhibits 3, 4, 10, 11, and 12.   However, the family court did not admit 
State’s Exhibits 10, 11, and 12.  ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     *** 
 
18 
 Williams had not objected to this portion of the State’s opening 
statements at trial.  See  Williams, SDO at 2 (citing Hawai ʻi 
Rules of Penal Procedure (“HRPP”) Rule 52(b); State v. Sanchez , 
82 Hawaiʻ i 517, 528, 923 P.2d 934, 945 (App. 1996)).10  The ICA 
stated “the burden [is] on the defendant to show bad faith on 
the part of the prosecutor, unless the fundamental rights of the 
defendant were substantially prejudiced.”  Williams , SDO at 3 
(quoting State v. Moore, 82 Hawai ʻi 202, 213, 921 P.2d 122, 133 
(1996)) (alteration in original).  The ICA also cited to State 
v. Valdivia, 95 Hawaiʻi 465, 479, 24 P.3d 661, 675 (2001), 
stating that this court concluded that even if a prosecutor’s 
comments were improper and made in bad faith, such misconduct 
was “harmless beyond a rea sonable doubt because the circuit  
court instructed the jury no fewer than three times that 
counsels’ statements and arguments were not evidence and not to  
be considered during deliberations; there was no evidence that 
the jury failed to adhere to those instructions.”  Williams , SDO 
at 3–4.  Similarly, although the ICA agreed the State’s comments 
were improper because the fact that minor son was taken out of 
Williams’s custody is unrelated to any of the elements of the 
offense, as the 
family court had instructed the jury both before 
                         
10  As discussed infra, an objection was not required due to the in limine 
ruling precluding such references.  ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     *** 
 
19 
 opening statements and when issuing general jury instructions 
that the attorneys’ comments were not evidence, and as the 
record did not demonstrate the jury failed to adhere to these 
instructions, it concluded the prosecutor’s  improper comments 
were harmless beyond a reason able doubt.  See  Williams , SDO at 
4.     
As to the second issue, the ICA did not address whether a 
proper foundation had been laid for the admission of State’s 
Exhibits 3 and 4.  Instead, the ICA ruled that even if the 
family court had erred in admitting the x-rays of minor son ’s 
femur bone into evidence, such error was harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt.  See Williams, SDO at 4.  The ICA referred to 
the testimony by Dr. Doerrige, Dr. Polk, and the two nurses 
regarding the extent of 
minor son’s injuries and the type of 
distress minor son had been in upon arriving at the hospital.  
See Williams, SDO at 4 –5.  The ICA also stated, “X-ray results 
are the type of data that doctors reason ably rely on in 
rendering a diagnosis and both doctors testified as to their 
observations that [minor son] suffered a fractured femur.”  Id. 
As to the third issue, Williams had argued no evidence had 
been presented that he had caused bodily injury to minor son .  
The ICA noted, however, that Dr. Doerrige had testified that a 
broken femur is “notoriously painful” and “would cause most ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     *** 
 
20 
 children to cry, and would prevent a child from sleeping through 
the night, standing, or walking,” yet Williams, minor son’s sole 
caretaker, had not brought him to the hospital until 
approximately ten hours later.  Williams , SDO at 5.  T he ICA 
also referred to the evidence that Williams had appeared aloof 
at the hospital despite minor son ’s severe distress and pain.  
Id.  Furthermore, the ICA pointed out that both Dr. Doerrige and 
Dr. Polk testified that minor son ’s injuries were inconsistent 
with Williams’s explanation of jumping or fa lling off a bed.   
Williams, SDO at 5-6.  The ICA also noted Dr. Doerrige ’s 
testimony that children do not typically learn how to jump until 
over twenty-four months old, and minor son  had just turned 
twenty-four months old.  See  Williams, SDO at 6.  V iewing such 
evidence in the light most favorable to the State, the ICA 
concluded that “there is sufficient evidence that Williams at 
least recklessly caused [minor son] to suffer bodily injury.”  
Id. 
In his certiorari application, Williams  essentially 
reasserts the same points of error: 
Whether the ICA gravely erred in holding that: (1) the 
prosecutor’s improper comments constituted harmless error; 
(2) the [family]  court did not err in admitting the x -rays 
into evidence without the improper [sic] foundation; and 
(3) there was sufficient evidence to sustain Williams’s 
conviction.

 III.  Standards of Review  
A. Prosecutorial misconduct 
 Allegations of prosecutorial  misconduct  are reviewed 
under the harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard, 
which requires an examination of the record and a 
determination of whether there is a reasonable possibility 
that the error complained of might have contributed to the 
conviction. Factors considered are: (1) the nature of the 
conduct; (2) the promptness of a cu rative instruction; and 
(3) the strength or weakness of the evidence against the 
defendant.  
   
State v. Maluia, 107 
Hawaiʻi 20, 24, 108 P.3d 974, 9
78 (2005) 
(citation omitted).  
B. Admissibility of x- rays 
[D]ifferent  standards of review must be applied to trial 
court decisions regarding the  admissibility of evidence, 
depending on the requirements of the particular rule 
of evidence  at issue.  When application of a particular 
evidentiary rule can yield only one correct result, the 
proper standard for appellate review is the right/wrong 
standard. However, the traditional abuse of  discretion 
standard is applied in the case of those rules 
of evidence  that require a “judgment call” on the part of 
the trial court.  
 
Kealoha v. Cty.
 of Hawaiʻ i, 74 Haw. 308, 319-20, 844 P.2d 670 , 
676 (1993).  In general, “[w]hether or not an x-ray photograph 
has been sufficiently verified so as to warrant its admission in 
evidence is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial 
judge and will be reviewed for an abuse of discretion. ”  State 
v. Torres, 60 Haw. 271, 276, 589 P.2d 83, 86 (1978).  
C. Plain error

to correct errors which seriously affect the fairness, ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***

serve the ends of justice, and to prevent the denial of 
fundamental rights.”  State v. Henley , 136 Hawai ʻi 471, 478, 363 
P.3d 319, 326 (2015)  (citations omitted).   
IV.  Discussion 
A. The deputy prosecuting attorney ’s elicitation of evidence 
regarding Child Welfare Services violated Williams’s right 
to a fair trial.  
 
Williams argues on certiorari that the deputy prosecuting 
attorney’s comments in his opening statement that minor son was 
“transferred to another family and reunited with his mother” and 
that the jury would meet “ Detective Melvin Raquedan, who assists 
with the transfer of custody,” as well as “social worker Robert 
Asato, who aids in the transfer from Tripler [] after [minor 
son] is treated and released and how he is ul timately reunited 
down the road with his mother” was prosecutorial misconduct, 
requiring this court’s further review.  
“The term ‘ prosecutorial  misconduct ’ is a legal term of art
that refers to  any improper action committed by a prosecutor, 
however harmless or unintentional. ”  Maluia, 107 Hawai ʻi at 25, 
108 P.3d at 979.   Williams asserts the ICA erred in ruling 11 
                         
11  We further stated in Maluia: 
 
[T]here are varying degrees of prosecutorial 
misconduct.  . . . [M]ost cases . . . do not involve ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     *** 
 
23 
 that, 
even if the deputy prosecuting attorney’s  comments were 
improper and made in bad faith, the misconduct was harmless 
beyond a reasonable doubt because the family court had 
repeatedly instructed the jury that the attorneys ’ statements 
and arguments were not evidence and not to be considered during 
                                                                              
(. . .continued)  
prosecutors who int end to eviscerate the defendant’ s 
constitutional and statutory rights[.]   
 
. . . . 
 
 Nevertheless, we decline to create a separate 
category of prosecutorial “mistake” or “error.” There are 
three reasons why we believe that our current method of 
analysis  -- in which all improper conduct is labeled 
“prosecutorial  misconduct ” -- is more appropriate.  
 
 First, there is no need to create separate  categories 
because this court already distinguishes innocuous 
prosecutorial  misconduct from more serious deceitful 
behavior [.] . . . In sum, whenever a defendant 
alleges prosecutorial misconduct , this court must decide: 
(1) whether the conduct was improper; (2) if the conduct 
was improper, whether the misconduct was harmless beyond a 
reason
able doubt; and (3) if the misconduct was not 
harmless, whether the misconduct was so egregious as to bar 
reprosecution. In the course of making these three 
deter
minations, the seriousness of the misconduct becomes 
evident, and we need not attach a separate label for our 
disposition to be clear. Consequently, a separate label for 
“misconduct” cases and “error” cases is unnecessary.  
 
 
 Second, a finding of “ prosecutorial misconduct ” is 
not equivalent to a finding of “professional misconduct” 
pursuant to the Hawai ʻi Rules of Professional Conduct 
(HRPC), and a prosecutor need not face disciplinary 
sanctions merely because we have used the term 
“prosecutorial  misconduct .” . . .  
 
 Third, we believe that separate nomenclature for 
different types of  prosecutorial  misconduct would lead to 
protracted litigation over semantics; this would place an 
additional burden on our courts with no corresponding 
benefit.   
 
107 Hawaiʻ i at 25-26, 108 P.3d at 979 -80.  ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     *** 
 
24 
 deliberations, 
and that there was no evidence that the jury 
failed to adhere to those instructions.  We agree with Williams 
that the ICA erred.
 
Whenever a defendant alleges prosecutorial misconduct , this
court must consider three factors: “(1) whether the conduct was 
improper; (2) if the conduct was improper, whether the 
misconduct was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt; and (3) if 
the misconduct was not harmless, whether the misconduct was so 
egregious as to bar reprosecution. ”  Maluia, 107 Hawaiʻi at 26, 
108 P.3d at 980.  Williams argues the deputy prosecuting 
attorney’s opening statement  comments were improper.   He 
specifically only raises the issue of improper reference to 
Child Welfare Services in the context of the opening statement.  
  
The deputy prosecuting attorney’s opening statement 
comments were clearly improper, but we need not address whether 
the ICA erred in ruling them harmless based on the family 
court’s instruction to not consider them as evidence .  This is 
because the deputy prosecuting attorney improperly elicited 
evidence of the involvement of Child Welfare or Protective 
Services in minor son’s case during the testimonies of Detective 
Raquedan, social worker Robert Asato,  and Dr. Doerrige, 
notwithstanding the family court ’s order  granting  a defense 
motion in limine excluding any  reference to an investigation and ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     *** 
 
25 
 case by Child Welfare Services and any legal issues stemming 
from that investigation and case.  On appeal and certiorari, 
Williams did not raise this elicitation of evidence as 
additional bases of misconduct.  When a defendant has not raised 
misconduct on appeal, we must determine whether the misconduct 
constituted plai n error affecting the defendant’s substantial 
rights.12   
Granted, the State was required to prove
 Williams was the 
“parent or guardian or any other person having legal or physical
custody” of [minor son] to establish the family court’s 
jurisdiction over the case
.   It is unclear why the extensive 
testimony that Williams identified himself as minor son’s father
to the medical witnesses was insufficient to establish this 
requirement and if not, why additional evidence could not have 
been elicited from one or more of the medical witnesses.   
Especially when it chose to call Detective Raquedan and social 
worker Robert Asato, the State should have been careful not to 1413 
 
                         
12  HRPP Rule 52(b) provides that “[p]lain errors or defects affecting 
substantial rights may be noticed even if they were not brought to the 
attention of the court.”   
 
13  See supra notes 2 and 3.  See also HRS § 701- 114(1)(c) (2014) 
(requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt of facts establishing jurisdiction 
for a person to be convicted of an offense).  
 
14  For example, nurses Santana and Blakey and Dr. Doerrige testified 
extensively regarding minor son and his father, Williams.  
 ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     *** 
 
26 
 elicit evidence 
regarding the involvement of Child Welfare 
Services, which violated the motion in limine.  In addition, it
should not have asked Dr. 
Doerrige whether she had alerted 
authorities to elicit her response that “Child Protective 
Services” had been contacted.     
Thus, because the elicited evidentiary references to the 
involvement of Child Welfare Services were  improper under the 
first factor of the prosecutorial misconduct analysis, we next 
address whether the misconduct was harmless beyond a reasonable 
doubt under the second
 factor.   
“Allegations of prosecutorial misconduct are [then] 
reviewed under the harmless  beyond a reasonable  doubt standard, 
which requires an examination of the record and a determination 
of whether there is a reasonable  possibility that the error 
complained of might have contributed to the conviction.”  State 
v. Pasene, 144 Hawai ʻi 339, 365, 439 P.3d 864, 890 (2019) 
(citations omitted).  To address whether misconduct was harmless 
beyond a reasonable doubt, we consider three prongs:  “the nature 
of the alleged misconduct, the promptness or lack of a curative 
instruction, and the strength or weakness of the evidence 
against the defendant.”  State v. Iuli, 101 Hawai ‘i 196, 208, 65 
P.3d 143, 155 (2003) (citations omitted).    ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
27 Addressing the first prong, the nature of the alleged 
misconduct, the evidence improperly adduced by the State that 
Dr. Doerrige called “Child Protective Services” and that Child 
Welfare Services had become involved in the case, which, at 
minimum, implied that Dr. Doerrige, a medical expert, suspected 
or found abuse, which was directly related to the central 
question of whether Williams had intentionally, knowingly, or 
recklessly caused minor son’s injury , and was therefore 
extremely prejudicial to Williams.  As to the second prong, the 
promptness or lack of a curative instruction, there was no 
curative instruction.  With respect to the third prong, the 
strength or weakness of the evidence against Williams, we note 
the medical witnesses differed on the cause of minor son’s 
injury and Dr. Happy testified on behalf of Williams that minor 
son’s injuries were consistent with jumping and falling off of a 
bed.  Therefore, the evidence against Williams was not so 
overwhelmingly strong that there was not “a reasonable 
possibility that the error complained of might have contributed 
to” the conviction.   State v. Underwood, 142 Hawai ‘i 317, 328, 
418 P.3d 658, 669 (2018) (citation omitted).  Thus, the 
prosecutor’s improper elicitation of evidence  affected 
Williams’s substantial rights and was not harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt.  ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     *** 
 
28 
 Turning to the third 
factor of the prosecutorial misconduct 
analysis, however, we do not find the misconduct so egregious as 
to bar reprosecution.  We therefore vacate the conviction, but 
remand the case to the family court for further proceedings 
consistent with this opinion. 
B. There was insufficient foundation for the admission of 
State’s Exhibits 3 and 4.  
 
On certiorari, without  identifying the x-rays he objects to
by exhibit number, Williams argues that certain x- rays should 
not have been admitted in evidence due to a lack of foundation. 
In his opening brief, Williams took issue with the admission of 
State’s Exhibits 3, 4, 10, 11, and 12.  The family court did 
not, however, actually admit State ’s Exhibits 10, 11, and 12, x-
ray images of minor son’s left leg taken at Wahiawa General  
Hospital, into evidence.  Dr. Doerrige testified, without 
defense objection, that these were x- rays of minor son’s left 
femur fracture taken at Wahiawa General Hospital and what they 
depicted was consistent with her diagnosis and examination of 
minor son .  When they were offered into evidence, however, the 
family court sustained the defense’s object ion based on lack of 
foundation.  The State then in dicated it would offer them later 
subject to linkage, but they were never proffered again.  Thus, 
we only address the admission of State ’s Exhibits 3 and 4.   
 ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     *** 
 
29 
 On certiorari, Williams asserts the State failed to 
authenticate the x-rays as those of minor son.   Williams asserts
the family court’s error in admitting  the x-rays cannot be 
considered harmless error because the admission of the x-rays 
depicting a broken and realigned femur substantially prejudiced 
him.  He also asserts the visual evidence of a broken bone was 
graphic and pulled at the emotions of the triers of fact and 
prejudiced his right to a fair and impartial jury under a rticle 
I, section 14 of the Hawaiʻi Constitution and the Sixth Amendment
to the United States Constitution.      
 
The State 
appears to concede a lack of foundation, as it 
does not argue a proper foundation had been laid for the 
admission of State’s Exhibits 3 and 4;  it only argued that their 
admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, as later 
concluded by the ICA,  but we proceed to address whether there 
was sufficient foundation for the admission of State’s Exhibits 
3 and 4.   
State’s Exhibits 3 and 4  would have been admissible as a 
“record of regularly conducted activity” pursuant to HRE Rule 
803(b)(6) if sufficient foundation was laid as to their 
authenticity by “the testimony of the custodian or other 
qualified witness, or by certification that complies with rule 
902(11) or a statute permitted certification[.]”   There was  no ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     *** 
 
30 
 certification, and Dr. Polk wa
s not a “custodian” of records of 
Tripler.  The issue therefore is whether Dr. Polk could be 
deemed an “other qualified witness” for purposes of laying a 
foundation for admission of the x-rays from Tripler.  
In State v. Fitzwater , 122 Hawai ʻi 354, 227 P.3d 520 (2010), 
this court stated: 
A person can be a “qualified witness” who can 
authenticate a document as a record of regularly conducted 
activity under  HRE Rule 803(b)(6) or its federal 
counterpart even if he or she is not an employee of the 
business that created the document, or has no direct, 
personal knowledge of how the document was created.  As one 
leading commentator has noted:  
 
... The phrase “other qualified  witness” is 
given a very broad interpretation. The witness 
need only have enough familiarity with the 
record-keeping system of the business in 
question to explain how the record came into 
existence in the ordinary course of business. 
The witness need not have personal knowledge of 
the actual creation of the documents or have 
personally assembled the records. In fact, the 
witness need not even be an employee of the 
record-keeping entity as long as the witness 
understands the entity ’s record- keeping system.    
 
There is no requirement that the records have 
been prepared by the entity that has custody of 
them, as long as they were created in the 
regular course of some entity’ s business.  
 
The sufficiency of the foundation evidence 
depends in part on the nature of the documents 
at issue. Documents that are “standard records 
of the type regularly maintained by firms in a 
particular industry may require less by way of 
foundation testimony than less conventional 
documents proffered for admission as business 
records.”

Hawaiʻi at 366, 227 P.3d at 532 (footnote omitted)
 (ellipsis 
in original).  
Dr. Polk had apparently worked for Tripler as a resident 
for four years in the late 1970s, but there was no foundation 
laid sufficient to render him an “other qualified witness” as to 
Tripler’s x-
rays.  In addition, the ICA’s statement that “[x] -
ray results are the type of data that doctors reasonably rely on 
in rendering a diagnosis and both doctors testified as to their 
observations that [minor son] suffered a fractured femur” as a 
basis for its conclusion that the admission of the x- rays was 
harmless does not go to the issue of whether sufficient 
foundation had been laid for their admission, but only as to a 
basis for expert testimony pursuant to HRE Rule 703 (1984).15 
Thus, insufficient foundation was laid for the admission of 
State’s Exhibits 3 and  4.  Because we vacate the conviction on 
other grounds, we need  not address whether the admission of 
these x-rays was harmless. 
 
                         
15  HRE Rule 703 provides in relevant part:  
The facts or data in the particular case upon which 
an expert bases an opinion or inference may be those 
perceived by or made known to the  expert at or before the 
hearing.  If of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in 
the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon 
the subject, the facts or data need not be admissible 
in evidence . ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***

 C. Williams’s conviction was supported by s ubstantial 
evidence. 
 
Because the defense raised the issue of sufficiency and we 
have decided the prosecutorial misconduct was not of the nature 
that precludes reprosecution, we must address the third issue on 
certiorari.  Namely, we address whether there was sufficient 
evidence despite trial error to support the conviction on the 
charge of assault in the third degree
.  See State v. Davis, 133 
Hawaiʻi 102, 120, 324 P.3d 912, 930
 (2014) (“[A] reviewing court 
is required under article I, section 10 of the Hawaiʻi 
Constitution to address a defendant’s express claim of 
insufficiency of the evidence prior to remanding for a new trial 
. . . .”).   
An appellate court reviews the sufficiency of evidence on 
appeal as follows: 
[E]vidence adduced in the trial court must be 
considered in the strongest light for the prosecution when 
the appellate court passes on the legal sufficiency of such 
evidence to support a conviction; the same standard applies 
whether the case was before a judge or jury.  The test on 
appeal is not whether guilt is established beyond a 
reasonable doubt, but whether there was substantial 
evidence to support the conclusion of the trier of fact.

 conclusion.”  Id. (internal quotation marks and citation 
omitted).   
For the reasons explained by the ICA in Section II.C above, 
the conviction of assault in the third degree was supported by 
substantial evidence.   Therefore, the third issue on certiorari 
lacks merit. 
V.  Conclusion 
For the reasons explained above, we vacate the family 
court’s March 28, 2017 final judgment , as well as the ICA’s  
September 25, 2018 j udgment on a ppeal, and remand this case to 
the family court for further proceedings consistent with this 
opinion.
