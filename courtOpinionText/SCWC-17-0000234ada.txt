Dkt. 11 OP*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
2 Appellee Noguchi & Associates, Inc. (Noguchi).  In the first 
chain of proceedings ( Pflueger I ), partial summary judgment was 
granted in favor of Pflueger  and a jury found in favor of 
Pflueger.  After th e ICA remanded to the circuit court to 
include previously excluded testimony, the circuit court in the 
instant appeal granted summary judgment in favor of  Noguchi, 
finding Noguchi ’s evidence  negated the causation element of 
Pflueger’s c laim and Pflueger offered no evidence to the 
contrary .  The ICA then disagreed , holding summary judgment  for 
Noguchi was improper in a  Summary Disposition Order, with a 
majority and concurring opinion.   
Currently a t issue is what Noguchi must demonstrate on 
summary judgment to negate the causation element of the 
negligence and negligent malpractice claims against it.   Noguchi 
contends it need only show that Pflueger’s insurer, National  
Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 
(National Union) , would have denied coverage even if  Pflueger’s 
grand jury subpoena matter  were timely tendered in order to 
negate the causation element on summary judgment.  By accepting 
this argument, both the circuit court and the ICA majority 
erred.  We clarify that to negate the causation element on 
summary judgment , Noguchi instead would need to demonstrate  that 
even if the grand jury subpoena  matter were timely tendered to 
National  Union, National Union  would not have been legally *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
3  obligated to advance Pflueger’s defense costs.   Accordingly, we 
vacate the ICA’s October 5, 2022 Judgment on Appeal, and remand 
to the circuit court for proceedings consistent with this 
opinion.   
I. BACKGROUND  
A. Factual Background  
Pflueger is an automotive retailer .  Noguchi procured 
for Pflueger a Directors and Officers liability insurance policy 
from National Union for policy periods covering September 27, 
2007 to September 27, 2008, and September 27, 2008 to September 
27, 2009 .  The policy required that National Uni on “advance 
defense costs” for Pflueger against covered claims.1 
On May 22, 2008, Pflueger and other entities were 
served with subpoenas related to a grand jury investigation.2  
Shortly thereafter , Pflueger ’s Chief Financial Officer Randall 
Kurata met with  Noguchi’s agents, Glenn Maruyama and Mike Bryan , 
                     
1  The 2007 -08 Policy provided Directors, Officers and Private Company 
Liability Coverage as follows:  
 
This policy shall pay the Loss of [Pflueger] arising from 
a: (i) Claim first made against [Pflueger] . . . during the 
Policy Period . . . and reported to [N ational Union] 
pursuant to the terms of this policy for any Wrongful Act 
. . . . [National Union] shall, in accordance with Clause 4 
of this Coverage Section, advance Defense Costs  of such 
Claim prior to its final disposition.  
The 2008 -09 policy  is worded exactly the same as above.  
 
2  In the ensuing months, further subpoenas were also served on Pflueger 
and other entities.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
4 allegedly to discuss the grand jury subpoenas .  At the meeting, 
Noguchi’s agents advised Pflueger that there was no claim under 
the insurance policies that National Union issued to Pfl ueger.3  
Noguchi did not forward a claim or the subpoenas to National 
Union or  to National Union’s “authorized representative” AIU 
Holdings, Inc.   Pflueger hired multiple law firms to represent 
its interests in connection with the grand jury proceeding,  
incurring substantial  legal fees . 
In February 2009, Pflueger ’s attorney submitted a 
demand letter tendering Pflueger’s defense to National Union.  
On April 29, 2009, AI U claim analyst Dennis Van Dina responded 
to Pflueger’s attorney in two letters, one for each insurance 
policy, stating Pflueger’s claim was not covered because the 
claim was untimely.4  The letter s then stated that even if timely 
                     
3  The parties dispute what was conveyed during the meeting.  Before the 
circuit court in the first chain of proceedings ( Pflueger I ), Pflueger 
contended it notified Noguchi that it received federal grand jury subpoenas: 
Kurata showed Noguchi’s agents a copy of all the subpoenas which were served 
on Kurata on May 22, 2008.  Kurata then asked if there was coverage for the 
subpoenas, and  Noguchi’s agent replied there was no claim unless an 
indictment was handed down.  In contrast, Noguchi contended Kurata never 
showed subpoenas or any documents, rather the meeting was about the IRS 
requesting information.  One of Noguchi’s agents testifie d he asked if 
anything like an indictment, subpoena, or anything more formal was handed 
down, and Kurata responded in the negative.  The parties also disputed the 
basis for and the precise substance of  the advice Noguchi’s agents  gave. 
 
4  The letters stated: 
 
(1) Policy no. 052 -68-49 has a Policy Period  September 27, 
2007 to September 27, 2008.  Coverage B  states that the 
Policy provides coverage for Claims  first made against the 
Company or an Individual  Insured during the Policy Period 
or Discovery Period (if applicable).   The Grand Jury 
Subpoena was issued  on May 22, 2008.  Thus, the matter will *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
5 reported, the materials su bmitted did not constitute a claim.5  
The letters stated  "the language of the Policy requires that an 
indictment, information or similar document is necessary for a 
Claim as defined."   After Pflueger’s counsel  responded , Van Dina 
reiterated AIU’s position on May 13, 2009.   
B. Pflueger I : Relevant Background6 
1. Circuit Court Proceedings  
On June 10, 2009, Pflueger filed a complaint alleging 
claims of declaratory relief, negligence, negligent 
                     
be deemed to  have been made on May 22, 2008.  Clause 7 
requires  that a Claim must be both made and reported during 
the Policy Period or Discovery Period (if  applicable)  
. . . . However, this matter was submitted to National  
Union on February 17, 2009; outside the applicable  
reporting periods found with Clause 7 Notice/Claim  
Reporting Provisions, and as amended by Endorsement  #2.  
Therefore, coverage is preclu ded. 
 
(2) "Policy no. 052 -68-49 [sic] has a Policy Period  
September 27, 2008 to September 27, 2009.  Coverage B  
states that the Policy provides coverage for Claims  first 
made against the Company or an Individual  Insured during 
the Policy Period or Discover y Period  (if applicable).  The 
Grand Jury Subpoena was issued  on May 22, 2008.  Thus, the 
matter will be deemed to  have been made on May 22, 2008; 
outside the Policy  Period.  Clause 7 requires that a Claim 
must be both  made and reported during the Policy P eriod or  
Discovery Period (if applicable) . . . . However,  this 
Claim was made outside the Policy .  Therefore, coverage is 
precluded.   
The second letter states the incorrect policy number.  The correct policy 
number is 01 -277-00-32. 
 
5  Van Dina noted “assuming this matter was both made and reported as per  
the requirements of the Policy, the materials submitted to  National Union 
would not constitute a Claim .” 
 
6  The first chain of proceedings is referred to as Pflueger I , and the 
second chain of proceed ings is referred to as Pflueger I I.  Only the 
background pertinent to the instant issue will be briefly summarized.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
6 misrepresentation, and breac h of the duty of good faith and fair 
dealing against AIU/National Union and Noguchi.   Pflueger 
brought negligence and negligent misrepresentation claims 
against Noguchi, alleging that Noguchi failed to tender the 
grand jury matter to AIU and National Union, and as a proximate 
result of Noguchi’s negligence, Pflueger was denied coverage  for 
legal fees and costs associated with responding to the grand 
jury subpoenas  and for liability that  Pflueger  may incur as a 
result of the claims made against it in the grand jury 
proceedings .  Pflueger also alleged that Noguchi made untrue 
representations that the grand jury matter was not covered under 
the policies,  and that Pflueger reasonably relied on these 
representations in declining for a ti me to tender the grand jury 
matter directly to AIU and National Union;  as a proximate 
result, AIU and National Union de emed Pflueger ’s eventual tender 
of the grand jury matter untimely and denied coverage.  
Two AIU employees were deposed  in 2011 and 2012 : 
Senior Complex Claims Director Tiffany Ngeo  and claims analyst 
Van Dina.  
Ngeo was asked whether it was AIU ’s “position that 
there was no coverage afforded for the grand jury subpoenas, 
regardless of when they were reported to . . . AIU  . . . .”  
Ngeo responded, “Well, we have two defenses.  One of them for 
each of the policy [sic], is that it was either not made or *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
7 reported within the policy.  And the other defense is that the 
grand jury subpoenas were not a claim per the policy. ”  Ngeo was 
also asked , “Is it fair to say that [AIU's]  position is that, 
first, there's no coverage for the grand jury  subpoenas –- grand 
jury subpoenas under the policy; and second,  even if there was 
coverage, they were not reported timely[?] ”  Ngeo responded, 
“[T]he grand ju ry subpoenas do not meet the  definition of a 
claim under either policy. ” 
  Van Dina was asked, “Even if it had been made timely, 
it's not a covered claim; is that right? ”  Van Dina responded, 
“Right.  Well, no.   I'm sorry.  Let me rephrase that.  Not that 
–- it may not even constitute the definition of a claim. ”  Van 
Dina was later asked, “Assuming this claim had  been reported to 
where you found it to be timely, would there  still have be [sic] 
coverage under the policy? ”  Van Dina  responded, “I do not 
believe, based on what I reviewed today,  that –- that a claim 
would have been made at that time.  So I would say that coverage 
would not be available. ”  Van Dina was asked aga in, 
“[R]egardless of whether the  claim was reported in May of 2008 
allegedly when the insured received or was served with the 
subpoena or in February of 2009  when it came across your desk, 
your position with respect to  coverage would not change? ”  Van 
Dina answered, “No.”  Van Dina  confirmed he believed  the 
subpoenas were not claims  under the policy.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
8 Pflueger finalized a confidential settlement agreement 
with AIU and National Union between January - March 2013.  The 
claims against Noguchi remained.  
On May 15, 2013, Pflueger sought a partial summary 
judgment ruling that  the IRS investigation and grand jury 
subpoenas constituted a covered claim under the insurance 
policies.  On July 10, 2013, the circuit court granted in part 
and denied in part Pflueger’s motion for partial summary 
judgment.  The circuit court granted the  motion: 
to the extent the Court finds that t he Grand Jury 
Subpoenas, dated May 22, 2008 and directed at Pflueger, 
Inc. constitute a 'claim' as that term is defined under 
Insurance Policy No. 052 -68-49 and Insurance Policy No. 01 -
277-00-32 issued by Nation al Union . . . to Pflueger, Inc., 
as the named insured.  
On July 22, 2013 a jury trial commenced . 
During trial, the circuit court excluded Van Dina's 
and Ngeo ’s testimonies on hearsay grounds .  Pflueger, Inc. v. 
Noguchi & Assocs., Inc. , 136 Hawaiʻi 372, 362 P.3d 805, No. CAAP -
14-0001032, 2015 WL 7723045 at *2 -3 (App. Nov. 23, 2015) (Mem. 
Op.).  The jury returned a special verdict form indicating that 
it found Noguchi liable for negligence and negligent 
misrepresentation.  The jury found that Pfluege r was thirty 
percent negligent, Noguchi was seventy percent  negligent, and  
the amount of Pflueger’s damages was $837,079.31.  The circuit 
court entered an Amended Final Judgment on July 11, 2014.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
9 2. Appellate Proceedings  
Noguchi appealed, and on January 7, 2016, the ICA 
entered a Judgment on Appeal  vacating the circuit court’s 
July 11, 2014 Amended Final J udgment, pursuant to the ICA’s 
November 23, 2015 Memorandum Opinion, which  held that the 
circuit court ’s decision to exclude Van Dina’s and Ngeo ’s 
testimonies  was error  because the ir testimonies  were essential 
to Noguchi’s defense.   Pflueger, Inc. v. Noguchi & Assocs., 
Inc., 136 Hawaiʻi 372, 362 P.3d 805, No. CAAP -14-0001032, 2015 WL 
7723045 at * 5 (App. Nov. 23, 2015) (Mem. Op.) .  This court 
denied P flueger’s  application for writ of certiorari.   Pflueger 
Inc. v. Noguchi & Associates, Inc. , No. SCWC -14-0001032, 2016 WL 
830982 (Haw. Mar. 2, 2016).   
C. Pflueger II  
1. Circuit Court Proceedings on Remand  
On April 11, 2016 , Noguchi moved for summary judgment 
on causation  grounds, arguing that the testimony of witnesses 
“fails to put forth any evidence which might support a finding 
of proximate cause against Noguchi. ”  In opposition , Pflueger 
noted the circuit court already ruled that the subpoenas were a 
claim under Pflueger’s insurance policies.  Pflueger  argued the 
testimony of five witnesses  demonstrat es that Noguchi was a 
substantial factor in bringing about Pflueger’s harm . *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
10 The circuit court granted Noguchi’s motion for summary 
judgment  on September 16, 2016 .  The circuit cour t held that in 
light of Van Dina ’s and Ngeo’s testimon ies that AIU would have 
denied the claim regardless of timelines s, the burden shifted to 
Pflueger to d emonstrate Noguchi’s negligence was a legal cause 
of Pflueger’s injuries, which Pflueger did not do.  
Pflueger filed a motion for reconsideration on 
September 26, 2016 , arguing that the causation issue ha d been 
repeatedly decided in Pflueger’s favor in prio r rulings, making  
the “law of the case” doctrine apply in favor of Pflueger.   
Noguchi argued Pflueger’s law of the case argument was 
inapplicable , not controlling, and improper as it could have 
been made previously .  The circuit court denied the motion for  
reconsideration and issued  a Final Judgment on March 14, 2017.  
2. ICA Proceedings  
On March 24, 2017, Pflueger filed a notice of appeal.  
Pflueger argued (1) the circuit court erred in granting 
Noguchi’s motion for summary judgment  because questions of 
material fact existed , and (2) the circuit court abused its 
discretion in denying Pflueger’s motion for reconsideration.   
In response, Noguchi maintained the burden shifted to 
Pflueger to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact, which 
Pflueger did not do,  making the grant of summary judgment for 
Noguchi proper.  Noguchi contended the records before the court *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
11 were not sufficient to support a finding of causation .  Noguchi 
also argued that Pflueger’s causation argument should be 
rejected because Pflueger did  not make the argument before the 
circuit court .   
In its reply brief, Pflueger argued, among other 
things, that the bases of its arguments remain ed the same before 
the ICA as before the circuit court.  
On August 31, 2022, the ICA issued a  Summary 
Disposition Order, with a majority and concurring opinion, 
determining the circuit court erred in granting Noguchi’s motion 
for summary judgment.  Pflueger, Inc. v. Noguchi & Assocs., 
Inc., 151 Hawaiʻi 430, 516 P.3d 984, No. CAAP-17-0000234, 2022 WL 
3928540 (App. Aug. 31, 2022) (SDO).   The ICA vacated the circuit 
court’s March 14, 2017 Final Judgment and remanded.  
The ICA majority accepted Noguchi’s premise that what 
AIU “would have done” had a timely tender been made was 
material.  The majority agreed that “this testimony [of Van Dina 
and Ngeo] undermined the causation element ,” but found that “it 
was not subject to only one inference and, thus, did not 
completely dispose of the causation element.”  Therefore, the 
majority determined Noguchi did not meet its  “burden of 
establishing that there was no genuine issue as to whether its 
conduct caused Pflueger's losses ,” making the issue one for the 
fact finder.  The majority also noted that even if Noguchi had *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
12 met its burden, Pflueger submitted opposing evidence that raised 
genuine issues of material fact . 
In a concurrence, Judge Hiraoka agreed that Noguchi 
did not satisfy its burden as a summary judgment movant, but di d 
not agree that what AI U “‘would have done’ had Noguchi timely 
tendered Pflueger’s subpoena” is  material.  The concurrence 
explained that had Noguchi timely tendered the subpoena:  
National Union would have had three options: “(1) advance 
Pflueger's defense costs to respond to the subpoena; (2) 
decline to advance defense costs; or (3) advance defense  
costs under a reservation of rights.   National Union's 
denial of a tender would not end the story; Pflueger could 
have filed a declaratory relief action, with or without a 
claim for bad faith.  If National Union agreed to advance 
defense costs under a res ervation of rights, National Union 
could itself have filed a declaratory relief action, with 
or without a claim for reimbursement of defense costs 
advanced .  
 
If a court were to rule that National Union was not 
obligated to advance Pflueger's defense costs , Noguchi's 
failure to tender the subpoena to National Union could not 
have been the legal cause of any damage to Pflueger; even 
if Noguchi had tendered, National Union would not have been 
obligated to advance defense costs.  On the other hand, if 
a court were to rule that National Union would have been 
obligated to advance defense costs, Pflueger would satisfy 
the legal cause element of its negligence claim against 
Noguchi.  
Thus, the concurrence determined  that whether National 
Union would have actually be en obligated to advance Pflueger’s 
defense costs if Noguchi timely tendered the subpoena was 
material, not what National Union would have done in response to 
a timely tender of the subpoena.  Therefore,  to sustain its 
burden as the summary judgment movant,  Noguchi had to show that 
even if Pflueger’s subpoena had been timely tendered, National *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
13 Union would not have been obligated to advance defense costs.  
“Only then could Noguchi’s failure to tender the subpoena to 
National Union not have been a legal cause of damage to 
Pflueger.”  Consequently , the concurrence concluded that Noguchi 
did not meet its burden and the circuit court erred by granting 
summary judgment.    
D. Application for Writ of Certiorari  
On November 30, 2022, Noguchi timely filed an 
application for writ of certiorari , asking this court  to vacate 
the ICA judgment and reinstate the circuit court’s grant of 
summary judgment in favor of Noguchi.  Noguchi raises three 
questions:     
(1) Whether the ICA grievously erred in holding Noguchi 
did not meet its initial burden on summary judgment, 
violating law of the case and ignoring requirements 
for causation in cases involving insurance agent 
malpractice.  
 
(2) Whether the ICA grievously erred in finding that a 
question of fact existed as to what AIU would have 
done with a timely tender in spite of the fact that 
nothing contradicted its representatives’ unambiguous 
testimony that they would have denied it.  
 
(3) Whether the ICA grievously erred in reversing a grant 
of summary judgment based on arguments and evidence 
that were not presented to the trial court (or even 
in Pflueger’s brief on appeal).  
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW  
A. Summary Judgment  
On appeal, the grant or denial of summary judgment is 
reviewed de novo. Furthermore,  
 
[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,  
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on 
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
14 is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the 
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of la w.  A 
fact is material if  proof of that fact would have the 
effect of establishing or refuting one of the essential 
elements of a cause of action or defense asserted by the 
parties.  The evidence must be viewed in the light most 
favorable to the non -moving party.  In other words, we must 
view all of the evidence and inferences drawn therefrom in 
the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.  
First Ins. Co. of Haw. v. A & B Props., Inc.,  126 Hawaiʻi 406, 
413, 271 P.3d 1165, 1172 (2012)  (citations omitted).  
The burdens o f the moving and non -moving parties on 
summary judgment  are as follows:  
The burden is on the party moving for summary judgment 
(moving party) to show the absence of any genuine issue as 
to all material facts, which, under applicable principles 
of substant ive law, entitles the moving party to judgment 
as a matter of law.   This burden has two components.   
First, the moving party has the burden of producing support 
for its claim that: (1) no genuine issue of material fact 
exists with respect to the  essential elements of the claim 
or defense which the motion seeks to establish or which the 
motion questions; and (2) based on the undisputed facts, it 
is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.   Only 
when the moving party satisfies its initial burden of 
production does the burden shift to the non -moving party to 
respond to the motion for summary judgment and demonstrate 
specific facts, as opposed to general allegations, that 
present a genuine issue worthy of trial.  Second, the 
moving party bears the ultima te burden of persuasion.  This 
burden always remains with the moving party and requires 
the moving party to convince the court that no genuine 
issue of material  fact exists and that the moving part is 
entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.

P.3d 1046, 1054 (2004) (quoting GECC Fin. Corp. v.  Jaffarian , 79 
Hawaiʻi 516, 521, 904 P.2d 530, 535 (App.  1995)) (emphasis 
omitted). *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
15 III.   DISCUSSION  
On summary judgment,  Noguchi cannot negate the 
causation  element by demonstrating that National Union would 
have denied coverage even if Pflueger’s grand jury subpoena 
matter were timely tendered.   We believe Judge Hiraoka’s 
concurrence provides a cogent analysis and a path forward in 
analyzing this matter.  
This court has explained:  
[W]here the non -movant bears the burden of proof at trial, 
a movant may demonstrate that there is no genuine issue of 
material fact by either: (1) presenting evidence negating 
an element of the non -movant's claim, or (2) demonstr ating 
that the non -movant will be unable to carry his or her 
burden of proof at trial.  
Ralston v. Yim , 129 Hawaiʻi 46, 57, 292 P.3d 1276, 1287 (2013).  
Noguchi attempted to demonstrate that the causation 
element of Pflueger’s claims was negated by the testimony of Van 
Dina and Ngeo, which purportedly  shows that no causal connection 
existed between Noguchi’s negligence and Pflueger’s injury  
because National Union would have denied coverage regardless of 
the claim’s timeliness .7, 8 
                     
7  Noguchi indirectly or impliedly made this second argument before the 
circuit court, and made the argument more clearly before the ICA.  
 
8  Noguchi also argued before the circuit court  that Pflueger would not be 
able to carry its burden of proof at trial due to lack of evidence, 
specifically that “Pflueger has presented no evidence that Noguchi’s conduct 
was a contributing factor in AIUH’s  decision to deny coverage to Pflueger.”  
Noguchi appears to have dropped this argument before the ICA and on 
certiorari.  As such, this court will not address it.  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
16 Noguchi misundersta nds what it must demonstrate to 
negate the causation element of Pflueger’s claims.   To prove 
causation, Pflueger must prove a case within a case, namely that 
National Union would be obligated to advance Pflueger’s defense 
costs if Pflueger’s grand jury sub poena matter were timely 
tendered  to National Union.   Pflueger needs to demonstrate that 
Noguchi was a substantial factor in causing Pflueger’s harm  in 
order to establish causation .  See Mitchell v. Branch , 45 Haw. 
128, 132, 363 P.2d 969, 973 (1961); see also Knodle v. Waikiki 
Gateway Hotel , 69 Haw. 376, 390, 742 P.2d 377, 386 (1987).   
Noguchi can only be a substantial factor in causing Pflueger’s 
harm if National Union were obligated to advance Pflueger’s 
defense costs if the grand jury subpoena matter were timely 
tendered.  If National Union w as not obligated to advance 
Pflueger’s defense costs, Pflueger could not have been harmed by 
Noguchi’s failure to  tender the grand jury subpoena  matter or 
Noguchi’s role in the untimely tender .  Therefore, Noguchi 
cannot be a legal cause of Pflueger’s harm if National Union 
were not legally obligated to advance Pflueger’s defense costs.  
See Thomas v. Kidani , 126 Hawaiʻi 125, 129, 267 P.3d 1230, 1234 
(2011) (“The causation element of legal malpractice is often 
thought of as requiring a plaintiff to litigate a ‘trial within 
a trial.’  That is, a plaintiff must show ‘both the attorney ’s 
negligence and also what the outcome of the mishandled *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
17 litigation would have been if it had been properly tried. ’”) 
(citation omitted); see also  Gibbons v. Ludlow , 304 P.3d 239 , 
244-45 (Colo. 2013) (noting the “case within a case” framework 
for analyzing legal malpractice is apt for analyzing broker 
malpractice, and applying the standard that “plaintiff must 
prove causation  by showing that  the claim underlying the 
malpractice action would have been successful ‘but for’ the 
attorney ’s negligence” to the broker context).  
Because Pflueger must demonstrate that National Union 
would be obligated to advance defense costs if the grand jury 
subpoena  matter were timely tendered  to establish causation , 
Noguchi must demonstrate that National Union would not be 
obligated to advance Pflueger’s defense costs if the grand jury 
subpoena  matter were timely tendered  in order to negate 
causation .  See Hawaiʻi Pizza Hut, Inc. , 105 Hawaiʻi at 470-471, 
99 P.3d at 1054 -55 (rejecting Pizza Hut’s argument that 
plaintiff did not meet her burden of establishing she was 
disabled by not being able to lift twenty -five pounds because 
she did not produce evidence the  average person could lift more 
than twenty -five pounds and concluding it was Pizza Hut’s burden 
as the summary judgment movant to produce admissible evidence 
that the average person in the population cannot lift more than 
twenty-five pounds).   Only then w ould Noguchi have demonstrated *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
18 that its role in the untimely tender was not a legal cause of 
Pflueger’s harm.   
Instead, Noguch i offered the testimonies of Ngeo and 
Van Dina, which both suggested that National Union would not 
have considered the subpoenas t o be a covered claim if timely 
tendered, in an attempt to negate the causation element of 
Pflueger’s claim s.  However, this testimony does not  negate 
causation.   As Judge Hiraoka’s  concurrence noted , if National 
Union denied  coverage after  the timely tender of Pflueger’s 
grand jury subpoena matter , Pflueger  could then file a 
declaratory relief action, with or without a claim for bad 
faith.  See Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes § 632 -1 (2016) (providing 
that courts may grant declaratory relief where an actual 
controversy exists between parties);  Best Place, Inc. v. Penn 
Am. Ins. Co. , 82 Hawaiʻi 120, 132,  920 P.2d 334, 346 (1996) 
(holding that “there is a legal duty, implied in a  first- and 
third-party insurance contract, that the insurer must act in 
good faith in dealing with its insured, and a breach of that 
duty of good faith  gives rise to an independent tort cause of 
action.”); see also  Steven Plitt, et al., Couch on Insurance  § 
202:4 (3d ed. Nov. 2022) (“[I]f  the insurer refuses to defend an 
action against the insured based on a claim actually within the 
coverage of the policy, on the ground that it is outside policy 
coverage, such a refusal  . . . constitutes an unjustified *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
19 refusal and renders the insurer liable for breach of its 
contract.   The failure to provide a defense when the insurer is 
obligated to do so is sufficient to sustain a cause of action in 
tort in addition to one for breach of contract.” ).  National 
Union’s disclaimer of coverage is not determinative of  
Pflueger’s legal rights or  legally cognizable harm – only a 
court’s ruling on the matter is.9   
Therefore, t he circuit court ’s grant of summary 
judgment in favor of Noguchi  on the grounds that Van Dina ’s and 
Ngeo’s testimonies negated the causation element was incorrect.  
The ICA majority’s acceptance of Noguchi’s causation argument 
was similarly incorrect.  
In light of our foregoing analysis, Noguchi’s 
remaining arguments on certiorari do not need to be addressed .  
IV. CONCLUSION  
As the summary judgment movant, Noguchi cannot refute 
the causation element by demonstrating National Union would have 
denied coverage if Pflueger’s grand jury subpoena matter were 
                     
9  Indeed, Noguchi’s argument leads to an absurd result.  The insurer 
would determine wheth er the insured had a legally cognizable harm sufficient 
for causation, and would effectively insulate insurance brokers from 
liability by stating more than one ground for the denial of coverage (which 
insurers may be incentivized to do).  See generally , Steven Plitt, et al., 
Couch on Insurance  § 198:52-55 (3d ed. Nov. 2022) (discussing waiver and 
estoppel of an insurer’s defenses based on the insurer’s disclaimer of 
coverage ); see also  Van Dina’s testimony stating:  “generally you try and be 
as thorough as y ou can.  Not to say that you throw in the kitchen sink, but – 
but you try and – really anything that’s going to be applicable is 
applicable.”

circuit court and the ICA majority incorrectly analyzed 
Noguchi’s burden regarding the causation element, we vacate the

circuit court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
