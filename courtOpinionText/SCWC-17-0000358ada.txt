 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
In this case, we consider whether a letter from pro se 
litigant , Petitioner /Defendant -Appellant Jonah Ke‘eaumoku Kapu 
(“Kapu”) , should have been liberally construed by the Circuit 
Court of the Second Circuit (“circuit court ”) as a motion for 
reconsideration of the circu it court’s order granting summary 
judgment to Respondent/Plaintiff -Appellee, Makila Land Co., LLC 
(“Makila”), that resulted in Kapu and his family losing their 
only home. 
We agree with Kapu that his pro se letter should have 
been liberally construed as a motion for reconsideration 
pursuant to this court’s policy to afford pro se litigants equal 
access to justice. Consequently, we also agree that the circuit 
court erred in failing to provide Kapu a n opportunity to be 
heard on the merits of that motion . 
We therefore vacate the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ 
(“ICA”) April 1, 2019 Judgment on Appeal and vacate in part the 
ICA’s November 2 1, 2016 Judgment on Appeal, and remand to the 
circuit court for proceedings consistent with this opinion. 
I. BACKGROUND 
This case is on appeal for the second time. In the 
first appeal, Kap u challenged the circuit court’s award of 
summary judgment in favor of Makila on Makila’s paper title

6136995, at *1 (App. Oct. 21, 2016 ) (mem.). The ICA in Makila I 
vacated in part the circuit court’s entry of summary judgment in 
favor of Makila and held that there were genuine issues of 
material fact as to Makila’s paper title claim.3 Specifically , 
the ICA held that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to 
whether Makila establish ed that it received a conveyance of 
title to ‘Āpana 1 (paper title) from Pioneer Mill Company , 
Limited (“Pioneer Mill”). Id. at *13. The ICA therefore 
vacated in part the circuit court’s award of summary judgment 
and remanded the matter for further proceedings . Id. at *14,

judgment in favor of Makila on the basis that Makila established

appealed the circuit court’s award of summary judgment to Makila

0000358, 2019 WL 968642, at *2 ( App. Feb. 28, 2019) (SDO) . The 
ICA in Makila II held that the circuit court’s award of summary 
judgment to Makila was proper because Kapu failed to “present a 
substantive argument in oppositi on to” Makila’s motion for 
judgment after remand . Id. The ICA further held that Kapu’s 
argument that Pioneer Mill could not transfer paper title to 
Makila because Kapu was the rightful owner of ‘Āpana 1 was 
“foreclosed by our decision in [Makila I ] that Makila had proven 
its paper title through to Pioneer [Mill] as law of the case.” 
Id. 
On certiorari , Kapu contests , (1) the ICA’s memorandum 
opinion in Makila I , which held that Kapu failed to m eet his 
burden of proof for a dverse possession, and (2) the ICA’s 
decision in Makila II affirming the circuit court’s entry of 
summary judgment in favor of Makila on remand.

division, may consist of several ʻāpana.” Id. 
6 Makila’s complaint set out the following chain of title. Olala, 
the original awardee of ʻĀpana 1, did not convey ʻĀpana 1 during his life and 
died intestate, whereupon title des cended to his three heirs, Kaikaamolani, 
Kua (k), and Waihoikaea, a lso known as Waihoikaea Olala. Kaikaamolani 
conveyed by deed to Waih oikaea Olala on July 23, 1866. Kua died intestate, 
whereupon title descended to his son, Kauhai, who conveyed his inter est by 
deed to Waihoi kaea Olala on August 16, 1883. Waihoikaea Olala conveyed ʻĀpana 
1 by deed to Kainoa (w), also known as Kainoa Kikue Olala (w). Kainoa Kikue 
Olala did not convey ʻĀpana 1 during her life and died intestate, whereupon 
title descended t o her three children, Samuel Hiku Kahalia, Samuel Hakalaau, 
and Sarah K. Peter. Samuel Hiku Kahalia did not convey during life and died 
intestate, whereupon his inter est descended to his siblings. Samuel Hakalaau 
conveyed his half interest in ʻĀpana 1 by deed to Pioneer Mill on January 27, 
1951, reserving a life estate for himself which terminated on his death.

Named defendant Jonah Keʻeaumoku Kapu and his father, 
John Paul Kapu (collectively, “the Kapus”) , filed an answer and 
counterclaim to Makila’s complaint, alleging that they were the 
owners of ʻĀpana 1 because unlike Makila, they are direct 
descendants of original owner Olala, and alternatively because 
they had gained title to ʻĀpana 1 by adverse possession. The 
Kapus demanded that the circuit court dismiss Makila’s complaint 
and declare them the owners of ʻĀpana 1. 
In support of its claim of title in Makila I , Makila 
filed four motions for summary judgment claiming paper title to 
‘Āpana 1, with supporting documentation including deeds and 
probate records . The Kapus opposed Makila’s motions, claiming 
that genuine issues of material fact existed as to the 
identities of several names listed i n Makila’s chain of title ,7 
. . . continued 
Hakalaau on October 19, 1951, and Samuel Hakalaau then co nveyed this half 
interest to Pioneer Mill on November 5, 1951, again reserving a life estate 
which terminated on his death . On January 16, 2001, Pioneer Mill conveyed 
its full fee simple title to ʻĀpana 1 to Makila by deed. 
7 The Kapus con tested whether Waihoikaea Olala was the same person 
as Waihoikaea, whether Kainoa (w) was the same person as Kainoa Kikue Olala 
(w), whether Kainoa (w) was the natural mother of Samu el Hiku Kahalia, 
whether Samuel Hiku Kahalia and Samuel Hakalaau both have Kainoa as their 
natural mother, whether Samu el Hiku Kahalia, Samu el Hakalaau and Sarah K. 
Peter were the natural children of Kainoa (w) and whether they were th e only 
children of Kainoa (w). 
The Kapus asserted a chain of title that differed from Makila’ s. 
Kapu Hakalaau, also known as Samuel Kapu, was a natural son of Hiku and 
Kainoa. Kapu Hakalaau, also known as Samuel Kapu married Julia Kaleo. Kapu 
Hakalaau and Julia Kaleo had a s on named John Paul Kekai Kapu. John Paul

specifically contending that Makila erroneously identified a 
“Samuel Hakalaau” as being part of the chain of title as the 
person who conveyed paper title to Pioneer Mill. The Kapus 
contended that the Samuel Hakalaau  identified by Makila was not 
the Samuel Hakalaau in the chain of title.   According to the 
Kapus, the true Samuel Hakalaau in the chain of title was their 
ancestor, Samuel Kapu, also known as Kapu Hakalaau, from whom 
they claim lineal descent  originating with Olala.   The Kapus 
thus argued that genuine issues of material fact existed as to 
Makila’s chain or title and its alleged ownership of ‘Āpana 1.  
The circuit court granted Makila’s motion for summary 
judgment as to its paper title claim, but denied summary 
judgment as to the Kapus’ adverse possession counterclaim.8 In 
awarding summary judgment to Makila on the paper title claim, 
the circuit court determined that no genuine issues of material 
fact existed as to Makila’s paper title to ‘Āpana 1.9 The

Rhonda I.L. Loo ruled on the fourth motion and presided over all subsequent

circuit court therefore entered final judgment  on May 8, 2012,  
in favor of Makila and against all defendants, ruling that 
Makila was the owner in fee simple of ʻĀpana 1 and that it was 
entitled to possession.   The Kapus appealed to the ICA.   
2. ICA Proceedings 
On appeal in Makila I , the Kapus argued that the 
circuit court erred by granting Makila summary judgment on the 
paper title and adverse possession claims “because the evidence 
in the record raised disputed questions of material fact 
concerning who had superior title .”10 No. CAAP-12-0000547, 2016 
WL 6136995, at *10 . The ICA issued its memorandum opinion in 
Makila I on October 21, 2016.11 Id. at *1. With regard to 
Makila’s paper title claim, the ICA “vacate[d] the Circuit 
Court’s Judgment insofar as it granted summar y judgment to 
Makila on its claim of paper title to [‘Āpana 1]” and “quiete d 
title in favor of Makila.” Id. at *14, *21. Although the ICA 
concluded that Makila established a chain of title from Olala to 
Pioneer Mill, it held that Makila did not establish that it had 
received title to ʻĀpana 1 from Pioneer Mill because the 2001 
10 Although the Kapus were represented by counsel at the outset of 
the litigation, they informed the ICA in December 2015 that their attorney 
was no longer able to represent them due to medical issues , and as a result 
they were without legal counsel. 
11 The ICA panel in Makila I consisted of the Honorable Alexa D.M. 
Fujise, the Honorable Katherine G. Leonard, and the Honorable Lisa M. Ginoza.

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
deed conveying certain properties from Pioneer Mill to Makila 
did not make any reference to ʻĀpana 1. Id. at *13. 
Specifically, the ICA noted that the 2001 deed from Makila’s 
immediate predecessor -in-interest, Pioneer Mill, included a list 
of lands purportedly conveyed by the deed, but the list of lands 
did not make any reference to LCA 4878 -O, Royal Patent 2664 , 
‘Āpana 1. Id. Without that “essential link,” the ICA held that 
it could not “find that Makila satisfied its burden of proving 
its prima facie claim of paper title.” Id. The ICA therefore 
determined genuine issues of material fact existed and summary 
judgment on Makila’s paper title claim was improper. Id. at 
*21. 
With regard to the Kapus ’ counterclaim asserting title 
by adverse possession, the ICA held that Makila had “pointed out 
the absence of comp etent[] evidence to support” the claim, which 
shifted the burden to the Kapus “to respond with specific facts 
showing that there was a genuine issue for trial.” Id. at *17. 
The ICA further held that the Kapus had not “provided evidence 
of actual, open, notorious, and continuous use of [‘Āpana 1] for 
the statutory time period, and therefore failed to make a 
sufficient sh owing to establish the existence of the essential 
elements of their case, on which they would bear the burden of 
proof at trial.” Id. at *21. The ICA therefore held that

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Makila was entitled to summary judgment on the Kapus’ 
counterclaim for ownership by adverse possession . Id. 
The ICA affirmed in part and vacated in part the 
circuit court’s final judgment and remanded the case for 
proceedings consistent with its opinion. Id. No party filed an 
application for a writ of certiorari to review the ICA’s opinion 
in Makila I . However, because Makila was granted another award 
of summary judgment on remand on the same paper title claim in 
Makila I , the issues decided in Makila I are pertinent to the 
appeal before this court in Makila II . 
B. Makila II 
1. Circuit Court Proceedings on Remand 
On remand to the circuit court, Makila again moved for 
summary judgment. It attached to its motion for judgment after 
remand, evidence which it said “establishes that Makila received 
title to [‘Āpana 1] from Pioneer Mill.” To prove the paper title 
claim, Makila submitted a surveyor’s declaration that that 
concluded that ʻĀpana 1 is within TMK (2)4-6-21-4. Makila 
claimed that this evidence provided the “essential link”12 the 
ICA said was missing from its proffered chain of title in Makila 
I and thus entitled it to judgment as a matter of law. Makila 
12 The ICA identified the missing “essential link” as a missing 
reference to ‘Āpana 1 in the deed from Pioneer Mill.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
also attached to its motion for judgment on remand , proof that 
it had provided notice to the Kapus that it filed a motion for 
judgment after remand . Attached to the motion was a signed 
“Notice of Hearing and Certificate of Service ,” apparently 
mailed on or about December 20, 2016, which listed the names and 
mailing addresses of various defendants , including Kapu, and 
stated that “a true and correct co py of the foregoing document 
was duly served on this date on the above -named parties by 
United St ates mail, postage prepaid[.]” The notice, however, 
stated that the hearing would be held “at 8:15 a.m. on Tuesday, 
January 31, 2016 ” instead of in January 20 17. Makila claims it 
served the Kapus with this defective Notice of Hearing and 
Certificate of Service by mail . 
The Kapus did not respond to Makila’s motion for 
summary judgment . The Kapus also did not appear for the hearing 
on Makila’s motion for sum mary judgment on rem and on January 31 , 
2017. In granting Makila’s motion for summary judgment, the 
circuit court filed an order on February 10, 2017 stating that 
Makila’s evidence proved it had received title to ʻĀpana 1 from 
Pioneer Mill and granting Mak ila’s motion for summary judgment. 
In support of its order, the circuit court indicated that no 
opposition to Makila’s motion had been filed, and that the Kapus  
 
 
 
 12    
  
  
  
  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
failed to appear for the January 31, 2017 hearing on the motion 
for summary judgment on remand . 
However, a fter the circuit court filed its order , the 
circuit court filed , on February 23, 2017, an undated letter 
(“pro se letter”) it had received from Kapu “asking that the 
case regarding civil No 09 -1-0397(1) to vacate [sic] the order 
on Micheal Gibsons [sic] motion because we never received copies 
of the motion and only learned that the hearing occurred and 
decision made at last Friday’s settlement conference in another 
case involving the same parties.” The letter stated that Kapu 
had not receiv ed any correspondence about the case since the 
death of his attorney on December 28, 2016 . 
Additionally, o n March 1, 2017, the circuit court 
filed a notice of ex parte communication and a letter, dated 
February 21, 2017, that it had received from Victor ia Q. White 
(“White”) on or around February 27, 2017. In her letter , White, 
Kapu’s sister and one of the named defendants in the case, 
requested that the Kapu family be given an opportunity to answer 
the order granting summary judgment to Makila. She sta ted that 
Makila’s attorney had never informed any of them about the 
hearing, and that the only letters she received were “a letter 
from the Appellate court letting me know that we lost the 
Appeal” and “a letter that none of us has entered court dated  
 
 
 
 13    
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
                     
   
 
 
   
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
January 31, 2017.” She said that Makila’s attorney usually sent 
a copy of his letters to her Oʻahu residence and the family’s 
P.O. Box in Lahaina. She claimed that her family “would have 
been to court had we known.”  
Despite the evidence Kapu and White submitted pro se , 
informing the court that they had not received notice regarding 
Makila’s mo tion for summary judgment on remand nor notice of the 
court’s hearing on the motion, the circuit court declined to 
consider their request for a reconsideration of the order 
awarding summary judgment to Makila . The circuit court 
therefore entered its judgment in favor of Makila on March 21, 
2017 pursuant to its February 10, 2017 order granting Makila’s 
motion for summary judgment on remand. 
Kapu filed a pro se motion to vacate the order 
granting Makila’s motion for summary judgment on March 28, 2017 . 
Kapu argued that the order should be vacated under Hawaiʻi Rules 
of Civil Procedure (“HRCP”) Rule 60 (b)13 because he and his 
13 HRCP Rule 60(b) provides, in relevant part: 
On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may 
relieve a party or a party's legal representative from a 
final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following 
reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable 
neglect; . . . (4) the judgment is void ; . . . or (6) any 
other reason justifying relief from the operation of the 
judgment. The motion shall be made within a reasonable 
time, and for reason[] (1) . . . not more than one year 
after the judgment, order, or proceeding was entered or 
taken.

family never received a copy of Makila’s motion and were not 
aware of the date of the hearing. He stated that the first time 
he found  out about the motion and the order was on February 10, 
2017, when he and his wife attended a hearing in another case, 
during which representatives of Makila informed them about the 
order.   He stated that it was possible that he did not receive 
notice because his attorney had passed away before the appeal 
was decided. He also noted that the court had not responded to 
his February letter about Makila’s motion  for summary judgment. 
He claimed there had been a violation of HRCP Rule 5(a)  for 
failure of service,  which had affected his and his family’s 
substantive rights  by granting title of Kapu’s only home to 
Makila. Kapu claimed he was not afforded an opportunity to 
contest the motion and that therefore the circuit court’s order 
granting summary judgment to Makila should be vacated.  1514
Makila filed an opposition to Kapu’s motion to vacate 
claiming that Kapu received notice of its motion for judgment on 
remand. It argued that its motion for judgment on remand and 
14 In his opening brief before the ICA, Kapu explained that he and 
Makila are adverse parties in a separate quiet title case, Makila Land Co. v. 
Heirs or Assigns of Apaa (k) , Civil No. 02 -1-0107(2). 
15 HRCP Rule 5(a) provides, in relevant part: “ [E}very written 
motion other than one which may be heard ex parte, and every written notice, 
appearance, demand, brief or memorandum of law, offer of judgment, bill of 
costs, designation of record on appeal, and similar paper shall be served

notice of the hearing were accompanied by a certificate of 
service, sent by regular mail, and that the address listed for 
Kapu on that certificate was the same address as the one Kapu 
had listed for himself on his motion to vacate. Makila did not 
acknowledge the defective date contained in its no tice and 
contended that Kapu had adequate notice . Makila also claimed 
that the circuit court’s order granting its motion for summary 
judgment on remand did not affect Kapu and his family’s 
substantive rights . According to Makila, the ICA’s memorandum 
opinion in Makila I had already established that Kapu did not 
have any right, title, or interest in ʻĀpana 1. 
In his reply, Kapu noted that the ICA’s opinion did 
not instruct the circuit court to enter judgment in favor of 
Makila on its paper title claim, but vacated and remanded the 
case for further proceedings on that issue. Kapu argued that 
although the certificate of service may have stated that 
Makila’s motion was mailed, he and his family never received any 
motion or notice of a hearing. Kapu claim ed that they did not 
get copies of the motion, “[w]hether it was lost in the mail or 
unbeknownst to Plaintiff’s counsel was not actually deposited in 
the mail[.]”

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
denied Kapu’s motion to vacate without informing Kapu that the 
hearing on the motion to vacate would become his only 
opportunity to present his substantive argument contesting 
Makila’s motion for summary judgment . At the hearing, Kapu 
informed the circuit court that his attorney had recently passed 
and that his failure to initially respond to Makila’s motion for 
summary judgment on remand and appear for the hearing was due to 
the fact that he had not received notice . However, not 
realizing the circuit court would treat the hearing on the 
motion to vacate as his only opportunity to contest the merits 
of Makila’s motion for summary judgment, Kapu did not make his 
HRCP Rule 60 legal argument that the judgment should be vacated 
on that basis. Instead, his claim was that he should be 
afforded an opportunity to argue his case. Apparently , not 
recognizing that Makila's notice contained a defective January 
31, 2016 hearing date, t he circuit court concluded that because 
Makila’s motion had been accompanied by a certificate of service 
which listed Kapu’s address, Kapu presented no basis for 
vacating the order. It also stated that Kapu presented “no 
meritorious argument or explanation for why the motion for 
judgment after remand should have been denied in the first 
place” and that Kapu had failed to timely contest Makila’s 
motion.

2. ICA Proceedings 
Kapu, represented by counsel through the Hawaiʻi 
Appellate Pro Bono Program, appealed the circuit court ’s award 
of summary judgment on remand to Makila to the ICA. Kapu argued 
that the circuit court erred in granting Makila’s summary 
judgment motion and ordering judgment in its favor without 
affordin g him an opportunity to be heard on the merits . Kapu 
claimed that his pro se letter should have been liberally 
construed as a motion for reconsideration of the circuit court’s 
order granting summary judgment to Makila , a HRCP Rule 60(b)(4) 
motion to set a side the judgment as void, or a HRCP Rule 
60(b)(6) motion to set aside the judgment for any other reason 
justifying relief from the operation of the judgment and afford 
him a hearing. Kapu claimed that the circuit court ’s decision 
not to allow him a chanc e to address the merits of his argument 
“was particularly harsh ” in light of the fact that he 
specifically asked the circuit court during the August 18, 2017 
hearing for the opportunity to argue his case . 
In a summary disposition order, the ICA affir med the 
circuit court’s March 21, 2017 judgment. Makila II , No. CAAP -
17-0000358, 2019 WL 968642, at *2. The ICA concluded that the 
circuit court held a hearing on Kapu’s March 28, 2017 HRCP Rule 
60 motion to vacate the circuit court’s order granting the

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
motion, and therefore, Kapu was not denied “an opportunity to 
present evidence and argument in opposition to [Makila’s] 
Motion.” Id. The ICA also concluded that “[b]y failing to 
raise any substantive argument s in opposition to the Motion 
before the Circu it Court, Kapu has failed to preserve these 
arguments for appeal” and therefore waived a challenge to 
Makila’s motion for summary judgment on remand. Id. Further, 
the ICA concluded that “ to the extent Kapu ’s argument is based 
on a claim that Pioneer Mill could not transfer title to Makila 
because he had title to [‘Āpana 1], that argument is foreclosed 
by our decision in Makila I that Makila had proven its paper 
title through to Pioneer Mill [], as law of the case .” Id. 
Judgment on appeal was entered on A pril 1, 2019. 
Kapu filed an application for writ of certiorari, 
seeking review of both the April 1, 2019 Judgment on Appeal in 
Makila II and the November 28 , 2016 Judgment on Appeal in Makila 
I. In his cert iorari application, Kapu presented two points o f 
error: 
1. Did the ICA gravely err in holding that a pro se 
litigant waived his right to be heard on the merits of a 
dispositive motion – and that he waived his right to make 
those arguments on appeal – when that pro se litigant, who 
never received notice of the dispositive motion, repeatedly 
asked the Circuit Court to be heard on the merits of that 
motion and clearly objected to the Circuit Court’s ruling 
on that motion without having heard from him on the merits?  
2. Did the ICA err in its 2016 ruling in making multiple 
inferences – resolving multiple disputed issues of material 
fact – in favor of the moving party on summary judgment?

II. STANDARD (S) OF REVIEW 
A. Jurisdiction 
The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law 
that is reviewed de novo under the right/wrong standard. 
Waltrip v. TS Enter s., Inc., 140 Hawai‘i 226, 235, 398 P.3d 815, 
824 (2016) (internal quotation marks, brackets, and citation 
omitted) . 
B. Summary Judgment 
“We review a circuit court’s grant or denial of 
summary judgment de novo und er the same standard applied by the 
circuit court.” Haw. Cmty. Fed. Credit Union v. Keka , 94 Hawai‘i 
213, 221, 11 P.3d 1, 9 (2000) . Pursuant to HRCP Rule 56(c) 
(2017), summary judgment is proper “ if the pleadings, 
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, 
together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no 
genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party 
is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law .” We view the 
evidence in the light most favorable to the non -moving party. 
C. Pleadings of Pro Se Litigants

interpreted liberally, and Hawai‘i courts and agencies should not 
construe pro se filings in a manner that leads to a decision 
that does not promote access to justice.” In re Off . of Info.

III. DISCUSSION 
A. Kapu May Appeal the Decisions Made by the Circuit Court 
Awarding Paper Title by Summary Judgment to Makila 
Kapu seeks review of the circuit court’s grant of 
summary judgment in favor of Makila on both the paper title 
issue and the Kapu s’ claim for adverse possession. Makila 
argues that Kapu can no longer appeal the circuit court’s award 
of summary judgment in favor of Makila in Makila I , because Kapu 
did not seek certiorari review of the Makila I ICA decision 
within 30 days of the ICA’ s Judgment on Appeal pursuant to HRS § 
602-59(c).16 However, t he circuit court’s order granting summary 
judgment in favor of Makila as to the paper title claim was not 
a final judgment because it was vacated by the ICA in Makila I . 
Therefore, Kapu may app eal the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal in 
Makila I related to the ruling on the paper title issue. 
16 HRS § 602-59(c) provides, “An application for a writ of 
certiorar i may be filed with the supreme court no later than thirty days 
after the filing of th e judgment or dismissal order of the intermediate 
appellate court.”

   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Contrary to Makila’s argument, t here was no final 
judgment on the paper title issue as to whether Makila could 
prove that it received a title conveyance to ‘Āpana 1 from 
Pioneer Mill. The ICA in Makila I vacated the circuit court’s 
award of summary judgment to Makila , concluding that there were 
genuine issues of material fact as to whether Makila had paper 
title to ‘Āpana 1, and remanded the matter back to the circ uit 
court. No. CAAP-12-0000547, 2016 WL 6136995, at *1 4.17 Because 
the paper title claim in Makila I was vacated by the ICA , there 
was no final judgment on the paper title claim and Kapu was not 
required to file a certiorari application at that time . As 
there is no final judgment as to a chain of title for ‘Āpana 1, 
the entirety of the paper title claim is still an appealable 
issue and, on remand, can be relitigated pursuant to Makila’s 
summary judgment motion . 
In its 2019 Summary Disposition Order, the ICA held 
that its 2016 decision with regard to chain o f title from Olala 
to Pioneer Mill was the law of the case. Makila II , No. CAAP -
17-0000358, 2019 WL 968642, at *2. Thus, it appears that on 
remand, Makila could argue, pursuant to the law of the case 
17 On remand, the circuit court again awarded summary judgment to 
Makila on the paper title claim, which Kapu appealed to the ICA. Makila II , 
No. CAAP-17-0000458, 2019 WL 968642, at *2 .  
 
 
 
 22  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
doctrine, that the ICA’s 2016 decision cannot be revis ited by 
the circuit court. Although the ICA’s 2018 law of the case 
determination, along with the merits of the ICA’s 2016 ruling 
regarding chain of title from Olala to Pioneer Mill, could 
ultimately be appealed to this court after remand, it seems a 
waste of judicial resources to require that prolonged process 
when the record exists to allow us to address it now. 
We agree with Kapu that he correctly asserted that the 
ICA improperly resolved disputed questions of material fac t in 
its 2016 opinion with regar d to the chain of title from Olala to 
Pioneer Mill. The ICA’s opinion relied on multiple inferences 
about disputed facts that should have been left to a trier of 
fact to resolve. See, e.g., Makila I , No. CAAP -12-0000547, 2016 
WL 6136995, at *11 -13. As argued by Kapu: 
There are genuine issues of material fact as to whether 
‘Āpana 1, or any part thereof, was transferred from Olala to 
Kainoa. Even if ‘Āpana 1 had been transferred to Kainoa, 
there are factual disputes as whether Kainoa (Mr. Kapu’s 
ancestor) is the same person as Kainoa Kukue Olala and as 
to the identities of that person’s descendants.  
These factual questions must be resolved by a jury; the Circuit Court cannot do so by fiat.  
In other words, the circuit court improperly granted 
Makila’s su mmary judgment with regard to the chain of title from 
Olala to Pioneer Mill, and the ICA’s 2016 rulings with regard to 
that issue are not the law of the case.

    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
However, Kapu can no longer appeal the ICA decision in 
Makila I as to his adverse possession clai m, because the ICA 
affirmed the circuit court’s denial of Kapu’s motion for summary 
judgment claiming title to ‘Āpana 1 by adverse possession, and it 
is now far beyond the 30-day period to seek certiorari review of 
the ICA’s final judgment on that issue . HRAP Rule 40.1(a)(1). 
B. Kapu’s Pro Se Letter on Remand Should Have Been Liberally 
Construed as a Motion for Reconsideration 
Kapu correctly contends that the circuit court erred 
when it failed to construe his pro se letter , requesting that he 
be afforded an opportunity to contest Makila’s motion for 
summary judgment on remand , as a motion for reconsideration . 
We therefore hold that summary judgment granting Makila paper 
title to ‘Āpana 1 was erroneous. 
Filings prepared by a pro se litigant should be 
construed by courts in a manner that will afford the pro se 
litigant equal access to justice and an opportunity to be heard. 
Erum v. Llego , 147 Hawai‘i 368, 391-92, 465 P.3d 815, 838-39 
(2020) (“[I]t is well established that the pleadings of pro se 
litigants should be liberally interpreted in order to promote 
access to justice .”) (citing Waltrip, 140 Hawai‘i at 239-40, 398 
P.3d at 828 -30). This court has stated that “[a] fundamental 
tenet of Hawaiʻi law is that [p]leadings prepared by pro se  
 
 
 
 24   
   
   
  
   
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
   
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
litigants should be interpreted liberally.” Waltrip, 140 Hawai‘i 
at 239, 398 P.3d at 828 (quoting Dupree v. Hiraga , 121 Hawaiʻi 
297, 314, 219 P.3d 1084 1101 (2009)). “The underpinnings of 
this tenet rest on the promotion of equal access to justice —a 
pro se litigant should not be prevented from proc eeding on a 
pleading or letter to an agency if a reasonable, liberal 
construction of the document would permit him to do so.” Id. 
“[P]ro se filings, even when mis branded, should be reasonably 
construed in a manner that results in identifying a route to 
relief, not in rendering relief impossible. ” Id. at 241, 391 
P.3d at 830. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
Thus, a court abuses its discretion if i t construes a filing by 
a pro se litigant in a manner that prevents the litigant from 
seeking relief “ if a reasonable, liberal construction of the 
document would permit [the litigant ] to do so. ” Id. at 239, 398 
P.3d at 828 . 
In Waltrip, this court held that where “the only 
recovery available for an employee who is injured at work ” is a 
workers’ compensation claim, courts should liberally construe a 
pro se litigant ’s filings. Id. Similarly, we have held that 
where a restrictive interpretation of a pro s e litigant’s motion 
would extinguish his “only opportunity to recover on his 
negligence claim,” it should be “interpreted liberally[ .]”

Villaver v. Sylva , 145 Hawaiʻi 29, 36, 445 P.3d 701, 708 (2019 ) 
(holding that a pro se litigant’s “request for an inter preter at 
the hearing should have been interpreted liberally as a request 
to withdraw his admission s and file a late response [.]”). 
As a letter from a pro se litigant, Kapu ’s request to 
be heard on the merits of Makila’s motion for summary judgment 
should have been interpreted liberally as a motion for 
reconsideration of the circuit court’s summary judgment order in 
favor of Makila . The facts before the circuit court —after the 
ICA in Makila I vacated and remanded the order granting summary 
judgment to M akila—supported a construction of Kapu’s letter as 
a motion to reconsider the summary judgment order : (1) Kapu had 
been actively involved in the case throu ghout the litigation; 
(2) he was informed of the hearing on the motion for summary 
judgment during a deposition for another related case; (3) he 
acted promptly, by filing a letter with the court, upon learning 
there had been a hearing he was unaware of ; (4) his sister, 
Victoria White, also was unaware of the hearing ; (5) the 
hearing’s unfavorable ruling served as Kapu’s loss of legal 
title and physical possession to his only home; (6) Kapu 
informed the circuit court that his attorney ha d recently passed 
and could be one of the reasons he had not received notice of  
 
 
 
 26  
   
     
   
 
 
  
    
 
  
 
   
  
 
     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the hearing; and (7) Kapu filed his lette r with the court before 
the circuit court had entered its final judgment . 
This court generally concludes that a filing from a 
pro se litigant should be construed as a motion when a more 
restrictive interpretation would extinguish the only opportunity 
for the pro se litigant to be heard and seek relief . Villaver , 
145 Hawaiʻi at 36, 445 P.3d at 708 . In Villaver , we held that 
“Villaver ’s pro se request for an interpreter at the hearing 
should have been interpreted liberally as a request to withdraw 
his admissions and file a late response ” because “a more 
restrictive interpretation would have extinguished his only 
opportunit y to recover on his [] claim.” Id. Similarly, in 
Erum, we applied Villaver and concluded that a pro se litigant’s 
motion requesting a continuance should have been liberally 
construed in a manner that would have afforded Erum a hearing 
and “would have allowed reinstatement of the case and permitted 
Erum to proceed on his claim .” 147 Hawai‘i at 392, 465 P.3d at 
839 (citing Villaver , 145 Hawai‘i at 36, 445 P.3d at 708). 
In the present case, the circuit court erred by 
failing to liberally construe Kapu’s letter as a HRCP Rule 60(b) 
motion for reconsideration and therefore abused its discretion 
by proceeding with summary judgment without affording Kapu a n 
opportunity to be heard on the merits . In his letter, Kapu  
 
 
 
 27  
 
   
 
  
  
  
  
 
  
    
 
     
  
 
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
specifically requested that the court vacate the order on 
Makila’s motion because he “never received copies of the motion 
and only learned that the hearing occurred and decision made 
at . . . [a] settlement conference in another case [.]” 
Additionally, Kapu cited HRCP Rule 60, which is entitled, 
“Relief from judgment or order,” in his Apr il 13, 2017 letter 
and requested “appropriate relief” for not having received 
notice of the hearing. Because the circuit court’s more 
restrictive interpretation denied Kapu his only opportunity to 
contest the claim to his property, his pro se letter shoul d have 
been construed as a motion. 
Moreover, the circuit court’s failure to construe 
Kapu’s letter liberally and afford him an opportunity to be 
heard on the merits of the summary judgment motion thus 
“interfere [d] with the fair dispensation of justice. ” Ass’n of 
Apartment Owners of Kai Makani v. Olek sa, 144 Hawaiʻi 384, 442 
P.3d 447, 2019 WL 2281248 , at *3 (App. May 29, 2019) (SDO) 
(internal quotation marks omitted) . A pro se litigant’s failure 
to attend a hearing on a motion for summary judgment may be 
excused, and a subsequent motion for reconsideration granted 
under HRCP Rule 60(b)(1), when the pro se litigant did not 
receive notice of the hearing . Id. In Oleksa, we held that the 
pro se litigant’s failure to appear at the hearing was excused  
 
 
 
 28    
 
  
 
   
 
 
  
   
 
  
  
   
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
because the litigant was out of town and undergoing a medical 
emergency when the notice would have arrived by mail . Id. 
The facts here also warrant a reconsideration to 
provide Kapu the opportunity to contest Makila’s motion for 
summary judgment . The death of Kapu’s attorney, his pro se 
status, active involvement throu ghout the proceedings and quick 
action after discovering he had missed an important hearing 
dispensing an unfavorable decision depriving him of his only 
home warranted an opportunity for Kapu to be heard on the motion 
for summary judgment . See Querubin v. Thronas, 107 Hawaiʻi 48, 
59-60, 109 P.3d 689, 700 -01 (2005) (holding that lack of notice 
and failure to afford an oral hearing to a party against whom a 
motion for summary judgment was directed constituted actual 
prejudice and harmful error). In addition, the notice itself 
contained the wrong hearing date. Accordingly, the circuit 
court abused its discretion when it denied Kapu an opportunity 
to be heard on the motion for summary judgment. 
Because we hold that summary judgment was improper on 
this basis , we need not address whether Kapu had actual ly 
received the notice of hearing. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, t he circuit court abused its 
discretion when it declined to construe Kapu’s pro se letter as a

motion for reconsideration,  and erred when it denied  Kapu an 
opportunity to be heard on the merits of Makila’s motion for 
summary judgment. We therefore vacate the ICA’s April 1, 2019 
Judgment on Appeal  and the circuit court’s grant of summary 
judgment on February 10, 2017 on the paper title claim.   We 
further  vacate in part the ICA’s November 21, 2016 Judgment on 
Appeal with regard to the claim of title from Olala to Pioneer 
Mill, as well as the circuit court’s April 29, 2010 grant of 
summary judgment to Makila on that issue and remand for 
proceedings consistent with this opinion.
