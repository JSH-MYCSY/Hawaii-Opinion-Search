2 (Thompson) by complaint  with the offense of abuse of a household 
or family member .  Critically, the complaint was neither signed 
by a complainant nor supported by a declaration.  The State 
consequently did not com ply with its statutory obligation  to 
perfect the complaint.  In turn, the family court erred in 
issuing a penal summons .  We therefore reverse the Intermediate 
Court of Appeals ’ (ICA) June 15, 2020 Judgment on Appeal.  
I. BACKGROUND  
A. Family Court Proceedings .1 
On November 23, 2016, the State charged Thompson with 
abuse of  family or household member, in violation of Hawaiʻi 
Revised Statutes (HRS) §  709-906(1),2 via complaint .  The 
complaint consisted of a single page signed by a deputy 
prosecuting attorney .  The complaint did not bear any other 
signatures, and  the State did not attach a declaration or an 
affidavit to the complaint.  
Based on the complaint, t he clerk of the Family Court 
of the Third Circuit  (family court) issued a penal summons 
compelling Thompson t o appear  in the Kona district court  on 
January 11, 2017.  
                     
1  The Honorable Ronald Ibarra  presided. 
 
2  HRS § 709-906(1) (Supp. 20 16) provides in relevant part: “It shall be 
unlawful for any person, singly or in concert, to physically abuse a family 
or household member [.]” 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
3  On January 11, 2017, Thompson appeared  in family court 
in response to  the penal summons .  On March 2, 2017, Thompson 
filed a “Motion to Dismiss for Penal Summons Issued Absent 
Probable Cause Affidavi t, Complaint Lacking Supporting 
Affidavit, and Improper Arraignment” (motion to dismiss).  
Thompson asserted that the family court should dismiss the case 
for three reasons.  First, the complaint was deficient because 
it was “not by declaration, and it doe s not contain the required 
sworn affidavit ,” as required by HRS §  805-1.3  Second, because 
the complaint was deficient, the family court lacked probable 
                     
3  HRS § 805-1 (2014) provides:  
 
Complaint; form of warrant.   When a complaint is made 
to any prosecuting officer of the commission of any 
offense, the prosecuting officer shall examine the 
complainant, shall reduce the substance of the complaint to 
writing, and shall ca use the complaint to be subscribed by 
the complainant under oath, which the prosecuting officer 
is hereby authorized to administer, or the complaint shall 
be made by declaration in accordance with the rules of 
court.  If the original complaint results from  the issuance 
of a traffic summons or a citation in lieu of an arrest 
pursuant to section 803 -6, by a police officer, the oath 
may be administered by any police officer whose name has 
been submitted to the prosecuting officer and who has been 
designated by  the chief of police to administer the oath, 
or the complaint may be submitted by declaration in 
accordance with the rules of court.  Upon presentation of 
the written complaint to the judge in whose circuit the 
offense allegedly has been committed, the jud ge shall issue 
a warrant, reciting the complaint and requiring the 
sheriff, or other officer to whom it is directed, except as 
provided in section 805 -3, to arrest the accused and to 
bring the accused before the judge to be dealt with 
according to law; and  in the same warrant the judge may 
require the officer to summon such witnesses as are named 
in the warrant to appear and give evidence at the trial.  
The warrant may be in the form established by the usage and 
practice of the issuing court.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
4 cause to issue the penal summons under HRS §  805-3.4  Third, in 
the absence of a supporting affidavit o r declaration, the State 
could not arraign Thompson in compliance with Hawaiʻi Rules of 
Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 5(b)(1),5 which requires the State to 
                     
4  HRS § 805-3 (2014) provides:  
 
Summons in what cases.   Where, from the complaint, it 
appears to the district judge that the offense charged 
therein is not of a serious nature, or not one for which a 
severe penalty should be imposed, and where the person 
complained aga inst is so situated as to raise no 
presumption of the person’s attempt ing to elude justice in 
the premises, the district judge may, in the district 
judge’s discretion (unless the complainant in writing 
requests the immediate arrest of the alleged offender) , 
issue the district judge’s summons, wherein shall be 
recited the substance of the complaint, commanding the 
alleged offender to appear before the district judge upon a 
time to be therein stated, not less than twenty -four hours 
from the time of service of  summons, and then and there to 
answer the charge.  The summons shall contain a warning to 
the person summoned that failure to obey the same will 
render the person liable to attachment for contempt.  
5  HRPP Rule 5(b)(1)  (2014) provides  in relevant part : 
 
(1) Arraignment .  In the district court, if the 
offense charged against the defendant is other than a 
felony, the complaint shall be filed and proceedings shall 
be had in accordance with this section (b).  A copy of the 
complaint, including any affidavits i n support thereof, and 
a copy of the appropriate order, if any, shall be furnished 
to the defendant.  . . . .  When the offense is charged by 
complaint, arraignment shall be in open court, or by video 
conference when permitted by Rule 43.  The arraignment 
shall consist of the reading of the complaint to the 
defendant and calling upon the defendant to plead thereto.  
. . . .  The defendant may waive the reading of the 
complaint or the recitation of the essential facts 
constituting the offense charged at arra ignment .  . . .  In 
addition to the requirements of Rule 10(e), the court 
shall, in appropriate cases, inform the defendant of the 
right to jury trial in the circuit court and the defendant 
may elect to be tried without a jury in the district court.  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
5 give Thompson “[a] copy of the complaint, including any 
affidavits in support thereof[.]”  (Emphasis omitted.)  
Following briefing from the State and a hearing, the 
family court issued its Findings of Fact/Conclusions of Law 
Granting Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss for Penal Summons Issued 
Absent Probable Cause Affidavit, Complaint Lacking Supporting 
Affidavit, and Improper Arraignment (dismissal order).  As 
relevant here, the family court determined that  
As the complaint in this case is fatally defective due to a 
lack of supporting affidavit as required by HRS §805 -1, the 
penal summons was issued upon a faul ty complaint, and the 
arraignment was improper for failure to provide Defendant 
with the supporting affidavit, this case must be dismissed 
without prejudice.  
B. ICA Proceedings . 
The State appealed the dismissal order to the ICA.   
The State claimed that the phrase “declaration in accordance 
with the rules of court” was ambiguous insofar as “[t]here is no 
definition of or allusion to a specific rule of court.”  In the 
absence of any identified rule, the State asserted that the only 
relevant rule of court was HRPP Rule 7.   The State thereby 6
                     
6  HRPP Rule 7 (2012) provides in relevant part:  
 
(a) Use of Indictment, Information, or Complaint.   
The charge against a defendant is an indictment, a 
superseding indictment, an information, or a complaint 
filed in court .  . . . 
 
. . . . 
 
(d) Nature and Content s.  The charge shall be a 
plain, concise and definite statement of the essential 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
6 argued that the complaint was not defective because it complied 
with the requirements identified in HRPP Rule 7(d).  
The State added that the district court did not err in 
issuing the penal summons b ecause HRPP Rule 9(a)(1) does not 
discuss probable cause in the context of issuing a summons, 
while HRPP Rule 9(a)(2) explicitly requires probable cause for a 
warrant to issue.7   
Lastly, t he State asserted that the text of HRPP Rule 
5(b)(1) does not requi re that all complaints be accompanied by 
                     
facts constituting the offense charged.  .  . . .  A 
complaint shall be signed by the prosecutor.  .  . . . 
7  HRPP Rule 9 (2017) provides in relevant part:  
 
Obtaining the Appearance of Defendant  
 
(a) Methods.  
 
(1) Summons.  Upon request of the prosecutor, the 
clerk shall issue a summons for a defendant named:  
 
(i) in the complaint;  
(ii) in the indictment; or  
(iii) in the information.  
 
When a defendant is a corporation or any legal entity 
other than a natural person, a summons instead of a warrant 
shall issue to an authorized representative of the entity.  
 
(2) Warrant.  The court may order issuance of a 
warrant instead of a summons upon request of the 
prosecutor; provided h owever, that no warrant shall issue:  
 
(i) Upon a complaint unless it appears from the 
sworn complaint, or from affidavit(s) or 
declaration(s) filed with the complaint, that there 
is probable cause to believe that an offense has been 
committed and that the defendant has committed it[.]  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
7 an affidavit, and therefore any failure to provide an affidavit 
did not render the arraignment improper.   
In a published opinion, the ICA held that Thompson and 
the family court were correct that “Section 805 -1 required the 
Complaint to be signed by the complainant under oath or made by 
declaration in lieu of an affidavit consistent with HRPP Rule 
47(d).”8  The ICA therefore determined that the complaint against 
Thompson did not comply with HRS §  805-1.   
Neverthele ss, the ICA decided that a non-compliant  
complaint could still be used to initiate and maintain a 
prosecution  by penal summons .  The ICA reasoned that the crucial 
element for initiating and maintaining a prosecution is the 
prosecutor’s signature – and not a complainant’s signature – for 
two reasons.  First, the ICA noted that HRPP Rule 7 was amended 
in 2008 to remove  the option that a complaint “shall be  sworn or 
                     
8  HRPP Rule 47(d) (2000) provides:  
 
(d) Declaration in Lieu of Affidavit.   In lieu of an 
affidavit, an unsworn declaration may be made by a person, 
in writing, subscribed as true under penalty of law, and 
dated, in substantia lly the following form:  
 
 “I, __________, declare under penalty of law that the
foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge 
and belief.  
 
 Dated: 
  
  _________________________  
  (Signature)”  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
8 affirmed in writing before the prosecutor by the complaining 
witness and be signed by the prosecutor.”9  Second, the ICA read 
this court’s decisions in Territory v. Williams , 41 Haw. 348 
(Haw. Terr. 1956), and State v. Knoeppel , 71 Haw. 168, 785 P.2d 
1321 (1990), as supporting the proposition that a complaint only 
needs to be signed by a prosecutor to initiate and maintain a 
criminal prosecution.   The ICA therefore concluded that the 
family court erred in dismissing the complaint even though it 
did not comply with HRS §  805-1.   
Additionally, the ICA agreed with the State that a 
district court may issue a penal summons on a non-compliant  
complaint  because HRPP Rule 9(a) “distinguishes between a penal 
summons and an arrest warrant, requiring a proba ble cause 
showing for issuance of a warrant, but not for issuance of a 
penal summons.”  Thus, the ICA concluded that the district court 
did not e rr in issuing the penal summons.  
The ICA also agreed that Thompson was properly 
arraigned because HRPP Rule 5(b )(1) only obligates the State to 
provide defendants with affidavits when such affidavits exist.  
Relying on the premise that the State did not need an affidavit 
to initiate the prosecution against Thompson, the ICA reasoned 
                     
9  HRPP Rule 7(d) (200 0) provided in relevant part th at “[a] complaint 
shall be signed by the prosecutor, or it shall be sworn to or affirmed in 
writing before the prosecutor by the complaining witness and be signed by the 
prosecutor[.]”  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
9 that there was no need for the S tate to provide Thompson with a 
document that the State did not need to produce . 
II. STANDARD S OF REVIEW  
A. Statutory Interpretation  
The interpretation of a statute is a question of law 
which this court reviews de novo.  State v. Ruggiero , 114 Hawai‘i 
227, 231, 160 P.3d 703, 707 (2007).  
B. Interpretation of Court Rules  
“When interpreting rules promulgated by the court, 
principles of statutory construction apply.”  State v. Baron , 80 
Hawaiʻi 107, 113, 905 P.2d 613, 619 (1995)  (quoting State v. Lau , 
78 Hawaiʻi 54, 58, 890 P.2d 291, 295 (1995)) . 
C. Motion to Dismiss Charge  
“A [trial] court’s ruling on a motion to dismiss [a 
charge] is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.”  State v. 
Akau, 118 Hawaiʻi 44, 51, 185 P.3d 229, 236 (2008) (citation 
omitted).  
 
The trial  court abuses its discretion when it clearly 
exceeds the bounds of reason or disregards rules or 
principles of law or practice to the substantial 
detriment of a party litigant.  The burden of 
establishing abuse of discretion is on appellant, and 
a strong s howing is required to establish it.

10 III.  DISCUSSION  
A. The State may not request a penal summons using a complaint 
that does not comply with HRS §  805-1. 
1. The State must comply with the requirements of HRS 
§ 805-1 when filing a complaint for a penal summons.  
On application for writ of certiorari, Thompson 
asserts that the ICA erred in holding that a complaint used to 
seek a penal summons need not satisfy the requirements of HRS 
§ 805-1.  Thompson is correct.  
It is well -established that “when [ a statute’s] 
language is plain and unmistakable[,] the court is bound by the 
plain, clear and unambiguous language of the statute. ”  State v. 
Sylva, 61 Haw. 385, 387 -88, 605 P.2d 496, 498 (1980).   
Hawaiʻi law provides for only a single type of criminal 
complaint regardless of whether the complaint is used to 
initiate proceedings through an arrest warrant or a penal 
summons.  Pursuant to HRS §  805-1, 
When a complaint is made to any prosecuting officer of the 
commission of any offense, the prosecuting officer shall 
examine the complainant, shall reduce the substance of the 
complaint to writing, and shall cause the complaint to be 
subscribed by the complainant under oath, which the 
prosecuting officer is hereby authorized to administer, or 
the complaint shall be made by declaration in accordance 
with the rules of court.  
These statutory obligations apply regardless of whether the 
State uses the complaint to seek a penal summons or an arrest 
warrant.  Notably, HRS §  805-1 goes on to provide that  
Upon presentation of the written complaint to the judge in 
whose circuit the offense allegedly has been committed, the *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
11 judge shall issue a warran t, reciting the complaint and 
requiring the sheriff, or other officer to whom it is 
directed, except as provided in section 805 -3, to arrest 
the accused and to bring the accused before the judge to be 
dealt with according to law[.]  
(Emphasis added.)  In tu rn, HRS §  805-3 explains that  
Where, from the complaint , it appears to the district judge 
that the offense charged therein is not of a serious 
nature, or not one for which a severe penalty should be 
imposed, and where the person complained against is so 
situated as to raise no presumption of the person’s 
attempting to elude justice in the premises, the district 
judge may, in the district judge’s discretion (unless the 
complainant in writing requests the immediate arrest of the 
alleged offender), issue the d istrict judge’s summons[.]  
(Emphasis added.)  In other words, once the State provides the 
district court with a complaint that complies with HRS §  805-1, 
only then may the district court choose to issue a penal summons 
if certain requirements are met.  See id. §§ 805-1, 805-3. 
The requirements of HRS §  805-1 therefore  apply to all 
criminal complaints, regardless of whether the State uses the 
complaint to seek a penal summons or an arrest warrant . 
2. Pursuant to HRS §  805-1, a complaint must either be 
signed by  a complainant or supported by a declaration 
in lieu of an affidavit.  
Although HRS §  805-1 unambiguously obligates the State 
to either have a complaint subscribed under oath by a 
complainant or make the complaint by declaration in accordance 
with the rules  of court, t he phrase “made by declaration in 
accordance with the rules of court” is ambiguous.  In 
particular, the statute does not identify the “rules of court” 
to which the declaration must conform.  See HRS § 805-1. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
12 “When there is doubt, doubleness  of meaning, or 
indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an expression used in a 
statute, an ambiguity exi sts.”  Gray v. Admin . Dir. of the 
Court, 84 Hawaiʻi 138, 148, 931 P.2d 580, 590 (1997).  
Where the words of a law are ambiguous  
(1) The meaning of the ambiguous  words may be sought by 
examining the context with which the ambiguous words, 
phrases, and sentences may be compared, in order to 
ascertain their true meaning.  
(2) The reason and spirit of the law, and the cause which 
induced the legislature to enact it, may b e considered to 
discover its true meaning.  
(3) Every construction which leads to  an absurdity shall 
be rejected.  
HRS § 1-15 (2009).  “Moreover, the courts may resort to 
extrinsic aids in determining  the legislative intent.  One 
avenue is the use of legislative  history as an interpretive 
tool.”  Gray, 84 Hawaiʻi at 148, 931 P.2d at 590  (quoting State 
v. Toyomura , 80 Hawaiʻi 8, 18-19, 904 P.2d 893, 903 -04 (1995)) . 
The legislative history of HRS §  805-1 establishes 
that the legislature intended for complaints “mad e by 
declaration in accordance with the rules of court” to be 
complaints made or accompanied by declarations in lieu of 
affidavits.  When the legislature amended HRS §  805-1 to provide 
prosecutors with the option to make complaints by declaration, 
the Sena te Committee on Judiciary and Labor explained that 
“allowing the use of declarations in lieu of affidavits  for 
arrest citations and traffic crime complaints is consistent with 
current rules of court , and would not harm the offender’s right *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
13 to challenge the  veracity of the officer. ”  S. Stand. Comm. Rep. 
No. 1194, in 2007 Senate Journal, at 1557 -58 (emphasis added).  
Similarly, the judiciary submitted testimony that the amendment  
“would also authorize an alternative form for verification of 
arrest citations and traffic crime complaints by allowing the 
issuing or complaining officer to verify the citation or 
complaint by declaration.  Declarations in lieu of affidavits  
are authorized by court rules. ”  Judiciary, Testimony to the 
Senate Committee on Judiciary a nd Labor on H.B. 1204, 24th Leg., 
Reg. Sess. (Mar. 9, 2007) (Hon. Russel Nagata, District Court, 
First Circuit) ( emphasis added ); see also  Judiciary, Testimony 
to the Senate Committee on Judiciary and Labor on S.B. 1520, 
24th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Feb. 26, 200 7) (Hon. Corinne Watanabe, 
ICA).  Thus, th is elaboration that declarations in lieu of 
affidavits were allowed by court rules demonstrates that the 
legislature intended to allow for complaints made or accompanied 
by “declarations in lieu of affidavits.”  
Here, HRPP Rule 47(d) is the applicable rule of court 
pertaining to declarations in lieu of affidavits.  Pursuant to 
Hawaiʻi Family Court Rules (HFCR) Rule 81(c) (2015), “[c]ases for 
adults charged with the commission of a crime coming within the 
jurisdiction  of the family courts shall be governed by the 
Hawaiʻi Rules of Penal Procedure.”  In turn, the only HRPP Rule *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
14 that describes how a declaration in lieu of an affidavit may be 
made is HRPP Rule 47(d).10 
Thus, in order to comply with HRS §  805-1, the 
underlyi ng complaint should have been subscribed under oath by 
the complainant or made by declaration in lieu of an affidavit 
in conformity with HRPP Rule 47(d).  
3. A complaint that does not comply with HRS §  805-1 
constitutes a  fatally defective complaint, upon whic h 
a penal summons may not issue.  
Although the ICA acknowledged that the underlying 
complaint did not comply with HRS §  805-1’s requirements, it 
nevertheless held that the district court may issue a summons on 
a non-compliant  complaint.  In particular, the ICA reasoned that 
the State did not need to establish probable cause to request a 
penal summons.  However, by focusing on the issue of probable 
cause, the ICA overlooked the preliminary question of whether  a 
district court may issue a penal summons upon a complaint that 
does not comply with HRS §  805-1.  It may not.  
The courts must give effect to the State’s statutory 
obligations.  As previously discussed, when the text of a 
                     
10  The State argued before the ICA that “HRPP Rule 47(d) concerns Moti ons” 
because HRPP Rule 47(a) -(c) address es motions.  However, HRPP Rule 47 ’s 
title, “Motions, Affidavit or Declaration, and Responses,” identifies three 
related but distinct subjects: (1)  motions, (2)  affidavits or declarations, 
and (3) responses.  See HRPP Rule 47.  Further, HRPP Rule 47  is categorized 
under the HRPP’s “General Provisions ” heading.   We therefore disagree that 
the “declaration [s] in lieu of affidavit” identified in HRPP Rule 47(d) may 
only be filed alongside motions.  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
15 statute is clear, “the court is bound by the plain, clear and 
unambiguous language of the statute.”  Sylva, 61 Haw. at 387-88, 
605 P.2d at 498.  Again, HRS §  805-1 unambiguously requires the 
State to ensure that complaints are either subscribed under oath 
by a complainant or  accompanied by a declaration in lieu of an 
affidavit.  Supra at 10-14.  Given that the legislature 
recognized the need to protect “the  offender’s right to 
challenge the veracity of the [accuser],” we cannot say that the 
State’s failure to comply with HRS §  805-1’s requirements 
constitutes a mere formal defect for which dismissal is not 
warranted under HRPP Rule 7(d).  S. Stand. Comm. Rep . No. 1194, 
in 2007 Senate Journal, at 1557 -58.  Thus, the courts must hold 
the State to its obligations under HRS §  805-1 before granting 
the State a penal summons.  Sylva, 61 Haw. at 387 -88, 605 P.2d 
at 498.11 
Our holding that a defective complaint may be  
dismissed is not without precedent.   For instance,  this court 
held in Knoeppel  that “[t]he absence of the prosecutor’s 
signature in the complaint .  . . rendered the complaint fatally 
                     
11  Notably, an incomplete complaint that does not comply with HRS §  805-1, 
HRPP Rule 7(d), or both is distinguishable from an insufficient charge.  In 
the case of an incomplete complaint, the State does not satisfy the threshold 
requirements articulated by HR S § 805-1 or HRPP Rule 7(d).  See, e.g. , 
Knoeppel , 71 Haw. at 171, 785 P.2d at 1322.  By contrast, w hen a charge is 
insufficient, the defendant is deprived of due process.  See State v. 
Wheeler, 121 Hawaiʻi 383, 391, 219 P.3d 1170, 1178 (2009) (quoting State v. 
Jendrusch , 58 Haw. 279, 281, 567 P.2d 1242, 1 244 (1977)).  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
16 defective.”  71 Haw. at 171, 785 P.2d at 1322.  Given that the 
prosecuto r bears “the responsibility of determining whether or 
not to instigate a formal criminal proceeding,” the omission of 
the signature was not a mere formal defect and therefore 
constituted “a proper ground for dismissal[.]”  Id.  Similarly, 
the Tennessee Cou rt of Criminal Appeals has explained that when 
a State obtains a warrant based on a defective complaint, “[t]he 
State could have dismissed the defective warrant and 
reinstituted proceedings against the Defendant through, for 
instance, re -arrest, indictment , or presentment.”   State v. 
Wilson, 6 S.W.3d 504, 507 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1998).  
Consequently , the ICA erred in holding sub silentio  
that the State need not comply with its statutory duties.  In 
turn, the ICA also erred in concluding that “the Complaint was  
not defective and the penal summons was properly issued .”   
B. The State did not satisfy its burden of showing that the 
family court abused its discretion in dismissing the 
complaint without prejudice.  
Although the State acknowledges that the complaint did 
not comply with the requirements of HRS §  805-1, it contends 
that the family court erred in dismissing the complaint without 
prejudice.   In particular, the State asserts that if there is no 
probable cause to support a complaint, HRPP Rule 5(b)(2) only 
authorizes  the court to release the defendant on his or her own *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
17 recognizance , not dismiss the complaint without prejudice .  This 
argument is flawed for two reasons.  
First, the family court dismissed the complaint 
without prejudice because it did not comply  with the 
requirements of HRS §  805-1.  The presence of probable cause, or 
lack thereof, was therefore irrelevant to the family court’s 
dismissal of the complaint.  
Second, nothing in the text of HRPP Rule 5(b)(2) 
precludes a trial court from dismissing a  non-compliant 
complaint.   The rule provides:  
The plea shall be entered in accordance with the 
provisions of Rule 11.  The defendant shall not be entitled 
to a preliminary hearing; provided that if a defendant, 
having been arrested without a warrant, is he ld in custody 
for a period of more than 48 hours,  Rule 45 
notwithstanding, after the defendant’s initial appearance 
in court without a commencement of trial, the defendant 
shall be released to appear on the defendant’s own 
recognizance unless the court fin ds from a sworn complaint 
or from an affidavit or affidavits filed with the complaint 
or pursuant to subsection (a)(2) of this rule that there is 
probable cause to believe that an offense has been 
committed and that the defendant has committed it ; provided  
further that if the defendant demands a jury trial under 
subsection (b)(3) of this rule, the court shall, upon the 
defendant’s motion, discharge the defendant unless probable 
cause is found as aforesaid.  
HRPP Rule 5(b)(2)  (2014) (emphasis added) .  Consequ ently, unless 
there is a showing of probable cause,  a trial court is obligated 
to release a n arrested  defendant who has been held in custody 
without an arrest warrant for more than forty -eight hours .  See 
id.  However, nothing in the rule prevents the tria l court from 
dismissing a complaint  that does not comply with HRS §  805-1. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

ena A. Somerville Having failed to identify any “rule[] or principle[] 
of law or practice” that barred the family court from dismissing 
the complaint without prejudice, the State has not made “a 
strong showing” to establish any abuse of discretion.  See Wong, 
97 Hawaiʻi at 517, 40 P.3d at 919.  This court therefore cannot 
say that the family court abused its discretion  in dismissing 
the complaint without prejudice .  Id. 
IV. CONCLUSION  
In light of the fore going, HRS § 805-1 does not 
distinguish between complaints for penal summons and complaints 
for arrest warrants.  T he ICA therefore erred in holding that 
the State need not comply with its statutory obligations  simply 
because it sought a penal summons.  
Accordingly, we reverse the ICA’s June 15, 2020  
Judgment on Appeal, which vacated the family court’s April 17, 
2017 Findings of Fact/Conclusions of Law Granting Defendant’s 
Motion to Dismiss for Penal Summons Issued Absent Probable Cause 
Affidavit, Complai nt Lacking Supporting Affidavit, and Improper 
Arraignment .
