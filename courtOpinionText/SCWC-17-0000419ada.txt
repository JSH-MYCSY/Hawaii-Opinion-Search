OPINION OF THE COURT BY POLLACK, J. 
 
  This case raises  the issue of whether Hawai i Rules of 
Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 48
(b)(3) (2000) applies when the 
State on remand is given the option of either (a) retrying the 
defendant on the charges underlying 
three convictions vacated by 
the appellate court or (b) dismissing two of those charges and 
having the circuit court reinstate the conviction on the Electronically Filed

 remaining charge and resentence the defendant.  We also consider 
whether the State’s failure to disclose which two of the three 
charges would be dismissed before the defendant exercised 
the 
right of allocution at sentencing rendered the allocution 
constitutionally inadequate.   
  
For the reasons discussed below, we hold that HRPP 
Rule 48(b)(3) is applicable to the circumstances of this case,  
although the six-month period did not expire because  the 
commencement date of the time period under this rule is the 
effective date of the judgment on appeal.  We further hold that 
the State’s failure to identify which charges would be dismissed 
prior to the defendant’s sentencing allocution violated the due 
process clause under article I, section 5, of the Constitution 
of the State of Hawai i.  Lastly, we reaffirm that sound judicial 
administration instructs that the defendant be given the last 
word before sentence is imposed.  
I. BACKGROUND 
A. Circuit Court Proceedings 
  On February 14, 2014, Brok Carlton was found guilty 
after a jury trial in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit 
(circuit court) of kidnapping  as a class A felony, in violation 
of Hawai i Revised Statutes (HRS) §
 707-720(1)(d) (1993); robbery 
in the first degree, in violation of HRS § 708-840(1)(a) (1993 & 
Supp. 2006); assault in the secon d degree, in violation of HRS ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
3 
 § 707-711(1)(d) (1993 & Supp. 2007); and unauthorized c ontrol of 
a propelled vehicle (UCPV), in violation of HRS § 708-836 (1993 
& Supp. 2001).  On June 6, 2014, the circuit court sentenced 
Carlton to twenty years imprisonment for the kidnapping and 
robbery charges and five years imprisonment for the assault and 
UCPV charges, with all counts to run consecutively for a total 
of fifty years of imprisonment.1  Carlton appealed the judgment  
to the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) on the grounds that 
the jury was not properly instructed on the law of merger for 
the kidnapping, robbery, and assault offenses.  The ICA agreed 
that the circuit court erred, pursuant to HRS § 701-109(1)(e),2 
by not instructing the jury regarding the possible merger of 
these offenses.  The ICA affirmed the circuit court’s sentence 
as to the UCPV conviction, but vacated the convictions for 
kidnapping, robbery, and assault.   
  
The ICA ordered the State on remand to retry Carlton 
                         
 1 The Honorable Judge Rhonda I. L. Loo presided over the trial and 
on the remand proceedings.  
 2 HRS § 701-109(1)(e) (1993) states as follows:  
 
When the same conduct of a defendant may establish an 
element of more than one offense, the defendant may be 
prosecuted for each offense of which such conduct is an 
element.  The defendant may not, however, be convicted of 
more than one offense if: . . . . (e) The offense is 
defined as a continuing course of conduct and the 
defendant’s course of conduct was uninterrupted, unless the 
law provides that specific periods of conduct constitute 
separate offenses.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 on the kidnapping, robbery, and assault charges with appropriate 
merger instructions provided to the jury or to dismiss two of 
the three counts and have the circuit court reinstate the 
conviction and resentence Carlton on the non- dismissed count.  
The Judgment on Appeal was entered on June 27, 2016.   
  The State took no action until a hearing was held in 
the circuit court on January 11, 2017, when the State, for the 
first time, indicated that it was electing  to dismiss two of the 
three counts and would proceed with resentencing on the 
remaining count.  The State did not inform Carlton or defense 
counsel which counts would be dismissed and which count would be 
reinstated.  Instead, all of the counts were scheduled for 
resentencing at a later date.   
  
On January 17, 2017, Carlton filed a motion  to dismiss 
the three counts on the basis that HRPP Rule 48(b)(3)  had been 
violated because more than six months had elapsed between the 
entry of the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal o n June 27, 2016,  and the 
date of the State’s election on January 11 , 2017.3  In 
                         
 3 HRPP Rule 48(b)(3) states as follows:  
Except in the  case of traffic offenses that are not 
punishable by imprisonment, the court shall, on motion of 
the defendant, dismiss the charge, with or without 
prejudice in its discretion, if trial is not commenced 
within 6 months . . . (3) from the date of mistrial, order 
granting a new trial or remand, in cases where such events 
require a new trial.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
5  
(continued. . .)  
 opposition, the State argued that, by its plain language, HRPP 
Rule 48(b)(3) did not apply because a new trial was not required 
by the ICA’s decision , which allowed the State to elect between 
a new trial and resentencing.  A hearing on the motion was held 
on February 1, 2017, in which the circuit court denied the 
motion, stating that HRPP Rule 48(b)(3) “only applies to cases 
where such events require a new trial.  In this case, a new 
trial is not going to be the solution.  I understand the State’s 
going to go with re- sentencing.”    
  At the resentencing hearing on April 28, 2017, the 
circuit court asked defense counsel to proceed first with 
counsel’s sentencing argument.  Defense counsel stated that 
Carlton had maintained good behavior during his years in custody 
and that the court should consider Carlton’s  post-conviction 
conduct as a sentencing factor.  After counsel finished, the 
court asked Carlton if he had anything to say.  Carlton 
apologized for his actions and requested leniency.  The State 
then proceeded with its argument, focusing  on the sentencing 
factors under HRS § 706- 606.4  The State argued that the court 
                         
 4 HRS § 706-606 (1993) states the following:  
 
The court, in determining the particular sentence to be 
imposed, shall consider:  
(1) The nature and circumstances of the offense and the 
history and characteristics of the defendant;  
(2) The need for the sentence imposed:  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
6 
 should not consider Carlton’s conduct while he was in custody 
and asked the court to impose consecutive sentences because of 
the planning and premeditation involved.   The State argued that 
because Carlton had to recruit accomplices, gather various 
tools, and travel over an hour in order to carry out the crime, 
consecutive terms were necessary. 
  A t the end of its argument, for the first time, the 
State disclosed its decision to ask the circuit court to 
sentence Carlton on the robbery charge and to dismiss the 
kidnapping and assault charges.  Carlton’s counsel asked the 
court if the defense 
could respond, and the court allowed 
defense counsel to do so.  Carlton’s counsel main tained that the 
court could consider Carlton’s conduct while in custody and 
should particularly consider his completion of all the classes 
available to him while he was incarcerated.  After Carlton’s 
                                                                               
(. . . continued) 
 
(a) To reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote 
respect for law, and to provide just punishment for the 
offense; 
(b) To afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;  
(c) To protect the public from further crimes of the 
defendant; and  
(d) To provide the defendant with needed educational or 
vocational training, medical care, or other correctional 
treatment in the most effective manner;  
(3) The kinds of sentences available; and  
(4) The need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities 
among defendants with similar records who have been found 
guilty of similar conduct.  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 counsel responded, the court summarized the facts of the case 
and considered the 
sentencing factors under HRS § 706-606.  The 
court did not address Carlton after the State’s election, nor 
did it afford him an opportunity to address the court once he 
had been informed of the conviction on which he would be 
resentenced. 
  The circuit court then sentenced  Carlton to twenty 
years imprisonment on the robbery offense and ordered that the 
twenty-year term for the robbery offense and the five-year term 
for the UCPV offense
 run consecutively for a total of twenty-
five years.  The court’s  Amended Judgment; Conviction and 
Sentence; Notice of Entry was filed on April 28, 2017  (circuit 
court judgment).  Carlton timely appealed on May 15, 2017. 
B. ICA Proceedings 
  In a Summary Disposition Order
,5 the ICA agreed with 
the State’s contention, first raised  on appeal , that the clock 
for HRPP Rule 48 did not begin to run in this case until July 
28, 2016, when the judgment on appeal became effective pursuant 
to 
Hawaii Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 36(c)(1).6  
                         
 5 The ICA’s summary disposition order can be found at State v. 
Carlton, No. CAAP- 17-0000419, 2019 WL 2462827  (June 13, 2019). 
 
 6 HRAP Rule 36(c)(1) (2016) states in relevant part as follows: 
“The intermediate court of appeals ’ judgment is effective as follows: (1) if 
no application for writ of certiorari is filed, (A) upon the thirty -first day 
after entry . . . .”   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
8 
 The ICA concluded that Carlton’s argument fail ed because the 
State made its election before six months had run from when the 
judgment on appeal became effective , even assuming that HRPP 
Rule 48 applies to a remand that allows the State to elect 
between a new trial and resentencing.   
  The ICA also found that Carlton’s right of allocution 
was not violated because Carlton was aware that the State had 
not elected the specific counts for dismissal and did not object 
at the resentencing hearing.  The ICA sta ted that Carlton’s 
counsel could have requested that Carlton be allowed to speak 
again, but he did not.  On this basis, the ICA found that the 
issue was waived.   
  Despite the finding of waiver, the ICA went on to 
conclude that the circuit court did not v iolate Carlton’s right 
of allocution by asking Carlton to make a statement before 
knowing for which charge he was to be sentenced.  Carlton was 
aware of the evidentiary basis of each charge, the ICA stated, 
so the fact that he did not know which charges would be 
dismissed could not demonstrate a lack of notice as to the 
charges themselves or the evidentiary base s for them.  “Thus,” 
the ICA stated, “Carlton received adequate notice of the facts 
at issue in resentencing. ”  Accordingly, the ICA concluded that 
Carlton received notice and the opportunity to be heard, and 
therefore his right of  allocution as provided by the right to ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
9 
 due process was not violated.  
II. STANDARD S OF REVIEW 
  “When interpreting rules promulgated by the court, 
principles of statutory construction apply. ”  State v. Lau, 78 
Hawaii 54, 58, 890 P.2d 291, 295 (1995).  “ Interpretation of a 
statute is a question of law which we review de  novo.”  Id.  
“Therefore, interpretation of HRPP Rule 48 is a question of law 
reviewable de novo.”  Id. 
  “We review questions of constitutional law by 
exercising our own independent constitutional judgment based on 
the facts of the case. ”  State v. Phua, 135 Hawai i 504, 511 -12, 
353 P.3d 1046, 1053-54 (2015).  Therefore, we review questions 
of constitutional law under the right/wrong standard.  Id.  
III.  DISCUSSION 
A. Interpretation of HRPP Rule 48(b)(3)  
1. HRPP Rule 48 (b)(3) Applies to Cases On Remand in which the 
State May Elect Between a New Trial and Resentencing  
  “HRPP Rule 48 operates to ‘ensure an accused a speedy 
trial’ and to further ‘policy considerations to relieve 
congestion in the trial court, to promptly process all cases 
reaching the courts, and to advance the efficiency of the 
criminal justice process. ’”  State v. Fukuoka, 141 Hawai i 48, 
62-63, 404 P.3d 314, 328-329  (2017) (quoting State v. Estencion, 
63 Haw. 264, 268, 625 P.2d 1040, 1043 (1981)) .  This rule “ was ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
10 
 adopted in part to ensure the speedy, efficient resolution of 
cases in which a person is charged with a criminal offense and 
is subject to a possible term of imprisonment .”  State v. Lau, 
78 Hawai i 54, 60, 890 P.2d 291, 297 (1995).  HRPP Rule 48’s  
purpose is underpinned by the principle that “ [u]nreasonable 
delay in the determination of criminal action subverts the 
public good and disgraces the administration of justice .”  
Estencion, 63 Haw. at 268, 625 P.2d at 1043.   
  At issue in this case is whether HRPP Rule 48(b)(3)  
applies when the State is instructed to elect on remand a new 
trial on vacated convictions or reinstatement and resentencing 
of a vacated count or counts.  HRPP Rule 48(b) (3) states in 
relevant part as follows: 
[T]he court shall, on motion of the defendant, dismiss the 
charge, with or without prejudice in its discretion, if 
trial is not commenced within 6
 months . . . (3) from the 
date of mistrial, order granting a new trial or remand, in 
cases where such events require a new trial.  
 
The circuit court, in considering HRPP Rule 48(b)(3),  stated 
that the rule only applies when a new trial is required on 
remand.  The court found that a new trial was not required in 
this case because the State was given the option of seeking 
resentencing instead of retrying Carlton on the vacated counts.
   
  Since HRPP Rule 48(b)(3)  is a rule promulgated by the 
court, principles of statutory construction apply.  Lau, 78 
Hawaii at 58, 890 P.2d at  295 (employing principles of statutory ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
11 
 construction to interpret the applicability of HRPP Rule 48).  
This court’s construction of statutes is guided by well-settled 
principles.  See State v. Choy Foo, 142 Hawai i 65, 72, 414 P.3d 
117, 124 (2018); State v. Wheeler, 121 
Hawaii 383, 390, 219 P.3d 
1170, 1177 (2009) .  We first  examine th e language of the statute 
itself.  Choy Foo, 142 Hawai i at 72, 414 P.3d at 124.  If the 
language is plain and  unambiguous, we must give effect to its 
plain and obvious meaning.  Id.  Also, implicit in statutory 
construction is our foremost obligation to ascertain and give 
effect to the intention of the legislature, which is obtained 
primarily from the language of the statute itself.  Id.  
Finally, when there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or 
indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an expression used in a 
statute, an ambiguity exists.  Id.   When there is ambiguity, the 
meaning of ambiguous words may be sought by examining the 
context or resorting to extrinsic aids to determine legislative 
intent.  Citizens Against Reckless Dev. v. Zoning Bd. of 
Appeals, 114 Hawaii 184, 194, 159 P.3d 143, 153 (2007). 
  Applying these statutory principles to our 
construction of HRPP Rule 48(b)(3) must therefor e begin “with an 
examination of the plain language ” of the rule.  State v. King, 
139 Hawai i 249, 253, 386 P.3d 886, 890 (2016).  The language of 
HRPP Rule 48(b)(3) indicates that it applies “in cases where ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
12 
 such events require a new trial. ”  In this case, the ICA held in 
the first appeal that the failure of the circuit court to 
provide merger instructions  required that Carlton be given a new 
trial unless the State voluntarily dismissed two of the three 
counts.  The State counters that no new trial is required 
because it is empowered to elect a non- trial option.  While t his 
is correct, it is also true that the ICA required a new trial 
unless the State dismissed two of the three counts against 
Carlton.  Thus, u nder its plain language, HRPP Rule 48(b)(3) 
appears applicable as the ICA’s “order grant[ed] a new trial ” in 
a situation “where such events require a new trial .”  The fact 
that the new trial could be avoided 
by the State if it dismissed 
two counts does not substantively change the ICA disposition 
that a new trial was required unless the State followed specific 
steps to avoid this mandat e. 
  However, even assuming an ambiguity in the language of 
the rule, “this court ’s foremost obligation in [rule] 
interpretation is to effectuate the [rule’s]  purpose. ”  State v. 
Tsujimura, 140 Hawai i 299, 307, 400 P.3d 500, 508 (2017).  Our 
interpretation of HRPP Rule 48(b)(3), therefore,  must effectuate 
the purpose of the rule  to ensure an accused a speedy trial, 
relieve congestion in the trial court, promptly process all 
cases reaching the courts, and advance the efficiency of the 
criminal justice process.  Fukuoka, 141 Hawaii at 62-63, 404 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
13 
 P.3d at 328 -29.  If HRPP Rule 48(b)(3) did not apply in cases 
when the State may elect between a new trial and resentencing, 
the State would be able to delay retrying the defendant beyond 
the six-month period provided by the rule.  Indeed, the time 
period for the State to delay its election would extend without 
limitation and would only be circumscribed when the delay w as 
deemed to violate the constitutional right to a speedy trial, a 
very high hurdle to demonstrate.  Thus, to hold that HRPP Rule 
48(b)(3) applies only in situation s when a new trial is 
required, and not when the State may elect between new trial and 
resentencing, would undermine the purposes  of HRPP Rule 48 to 
ensure prompt processing of all cases and advance the efficiency 
of the criminal justice process.
 
 
 Further, “i t is well settled that this court may 
depart from a plain reading of a [rule] where a literal 
interpretation would lead to absurd and/or unjust results.”   
Morgan v. Planning Dep ’t, 104 Hawai i 173, 185, 86 P.3d 982, 994 
(2004) (quoting Iddings v. Mee- Lee, 82 Hawaii 1, 15, 919 P.2d 
263, 277 (1986)).  To read HRPP Rule 48(b)(3) as applying only 
when the appellate disposition requires a new trial as the sole 
option would, as discussed above, lead to results that are 
illogical and unjust in light of HRPP Rule 48’s purposes of 
ensuring a defendant a speedy trial  and advancing the efficiency 
of the criminal justice process.  See Estencion , 63 Haw. at 268, ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
14 (continued. . .)   
 625 P.2d at 1043. 
 
 Accordingly, we hold that HRPP Rule 48(b)(3) applies 
to cases when the State may on remand elect between a new trial 
and resentencing. 
2. The HRPP Rule 48(b)(3)  Clock Begins to Run when the Judgment 
of the Appellate Court Becomes Effective 
  Also at issue in this case is whether the clock for 
HRPP Rule 48(b)(3) begins to run once the appellate court files 
its judgment on appeal or when the judgment of the appellate 
court becomes effective.
  HRAP Rule 36(c)(1)  provides that,  when 
no application for writ of certiorari is filed, the judgment is 
effective “(A) upon the thirty-first day after entry or
 (B) 
where the time for filing an application for a writ of 
certiorari is extended in accordance with Rule 40.1(a) of these 
Rules, upon the expiration of the extension.”  The Commentary to 
HRAP Rule 36 states as follows:   
See Rule 41 and its commentary (“ the intermediate court of 
appeals’ judgment cannot be effective and jurisdiction 
cannot revert to the court  or agency from which appeal was 
taken until  the time for filing the application has expired 
or, if an application is filed, the supreme court has 
rejected or dismissed the application or affirmed the 
intermediate court of appeals’ judgment in whole.”)  
 
(Emphases added.)7  As explained by the Commentary to HRAP Rule 
                         
 7 The Commentary to HRAP Rule 41 (2012) states as follows:  
Effective for intermediate court of appeals’ judgments on appeal 
and orders of dismissal entered on or after January 1, 2012, a 
party has 30 days to file an application for a writ of 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
15 (continued. . .)  
 36, the court from which appeal was taken does not reacquire 
jurisdiction over the matter until the judgment becomes 
effective. 
  Thus,  until the judgment on appeal becomes effective, 
the lower court does not have the power to exercise authority 
over a case in order to schedule further proceedings.  Since 
trial cannot be scheduled until the judgment on appeal becomes 
effective, the clock for HRPP Rule 48
(b)(3) only begins to run 
once the judgment of the appellate court becomes effective.  
This interpretation is also necessitated by the fact that, in 
cases when this court accepts the application for certiorari and 
then affirms the judgment of the ICA in whole 
under HRAP 
Rule 36(c)(2)(B),8 the ICA’s judgment on appeal does not become 
                                                                               
(. . . continued) 
 
certiorari, which can be extended for no more than an additional 
30 days upon the filing of a written request for extension in 
accordance with HRAP Rule 40.1(a).  The time for filing the 
application is measured from the date the intermediate court of 
appeals’ judgment on appeal or order of dismissal was filed.  
Thus, the interm ediate court of appeals’ judgment cannot be 
effective and jurisdiction cannot revert to the court or agency 
from which appeal was taken until the time for filing the 
application has expired or, if an application is filed, the 
supreme court has rejected or dismissed the application or 
affirmed the intermediate court of appeals’ judgment in whole.  
The supreme court’s judgment on appeal is not subject to further 
state review and is effective upon entry.  
 
 8 HRAP Rule 36(c)(2)(B) (2016) states as follows: “The intermediate 
court of appeals’ judgment is effective as follows: .  . . (2) if an 
application for writ of certiorari is filed, . . . (B) upon entry of the 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
16 
 effective until entry of an order or other disposition by this 
court.  See HRAP Rule 36(c)(2) (B).  Under these ci rcumstances, 
the effective date of the judgment would generally  be more than 
six months from the date the judgment was filed by the ICA, and 
thus under Carlton’s interpretation the clock for HRPP Rule 
48(b)(3) would expire while the ICA decision is pending review 
in this court. 
  Based on the plain meaning of HRPP Rule 48(b)(3), as 
well as the rule’s purposes of ensuring an accused a speedy 
trial, relieving congestion in the trial court, promptly 
processing all cases reaching the courts, and advancing the 
efficiency of the criminal justice process, we hold that the 
clock for HRPP Rule 48(b)(3) begins to run when  the judgment of 
the ICA becomes effective.   
  Applying this holding to this case, the judgment on 
appeal in the first appeal was entered on June 27, 2016,  and no 
application for writ of certiorari or request for extension of 
time for filing an application was filed.   Therefore, under HRAP 
Rule 36(c)(1)(A), the judgment on appeal was effective upon the 
thirty-first day after entry, or July 28, 2016.  This made the 
HRPP Rule 48 deadline January 24, 2017.  
See State v. Jackson,

17 
 81 Hawai i 39, 50, 912 P.2d 71, 82 (1996) (stating that six 
months is construed as one hundred eighty days).  The State 
elected not to seek retrial on January 11, 2017.  Since this 
date was before the deadline of January 24, 2017, the ICA was 
correct when it concluded that the circuit court did not err by 
denying Carlton’s January 17, 2017 motion to dismiss this case 
for violation of HRPP Rule 48
(b)(3).   
B. Carlton’s Right of  Allocution  
  Carlton also contends that the circuit court’s 
sentencing procedure violated his due process right of 
allocution by not affording him an opportunity to address the 
court after the State elected which charges would be dismissed 
and which charge Carlton would be resentenced on.  “Allocution 
is the defendant ’s right to sp eak before sentence is imposed.”   
State v. Hernandez, 143 Hawai i 501, 509, 431 P.3d 1274, 1282 
(2018) (internal quotations and alterations omitted).  The right 
of presentence allocution is an important constitutional right 
guaranteed under the due process clause, article I, section 5, 
of the Constitution of the State of Hawaii.  Id. (citing State 
v. Davia, 87 Hawai i 249, 255, 953 P.2d 1347, 1353 (1998)).  The 
right is also protected by HRS § 706- 604(1) (1993), which 
provides in full that, “Before imposing sentence, the court 
shall afford a fair opportunity to the defendant to be heard on ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
18 
 the issue of the defendant’s disposition.”   HRPP Rule 32(a) 
similarly provides that the court, prior to imposing sentence, 
“shall address the defendant personally and afford a fair 
opportunity to the defendant and defendant ’s counsel, if any, to 
make a statement and present any information in mitigation of 
punishment.”9  The multiple layers of protection afforded to the 
defendant’s right of allocution reflect the multiple important 
purposes it serves.   
  
One “prime reason” for allocution is to provide the 
defendant an opportunity to plead for mitigation of the 
sentence.  Hernandez, 143 Hawai i at 511, 431 P.3d at 
1284 
(quoting State v. Carvalho, 90 Hawaii 280, 286, 978 P.2d 718, 
724 (1999)).  Allocution also provides the defendant the 
opportunity to dispute the factual bases for sentencing and to 
meaningfully participate in the sentencing process.  State v. 
Chow, 77 Hawaii 241, 250, 883 P.2d 663, 672 (App. 1994).  Beyond 
sentence mitigation, allocution is important because it allows 
the defendant to “ acknowle dge wrongful conduct, which is ‘ the 
                         
 9 HRPP Rule 32(a) (2012) states as follows:  
 
After adjudication of guilt, sentence shall be imposed 
without unreasonable delay.  Pending sentence, the court 
may commit the defendant or continue or alter bail, subject 
to applicable provisions of law.  Before suspending or 
imposing sentence, the court shall address the defendant 
personally and afford a fair opportunity to the defendant 
and defendant’s counsel, if any, to make a statement and 
present any information in mitigation of punishment.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 first step towards satisfying the sentenc ing objective of 
rehabilitation,’”  and it may have a therapeutic effect on the 
defendant.  Hernandez, 143 Hawai i at 511, 431 P.3d at 1284 
(quoting Chow, 77 Hawai i at 250, 883 P.2d at 672).  The 
defendant’s public acknowledgement of wrongdoing may also have 
collateral benefits by deterring others from similar conduct and 
“purging . . . any felt need for retribution in a victim, a 
victim’s family, or the community as a whole.”  Chow, 77 Hawaii 
at 250, 883 P.2d at 672.   
1. Due Process Requires the Court to Afford the Defendant an 
Opportunity to be Heard Prior to Sentencing at a Meaningful 
Time and in a Meaningful Manner 
 
 It is the duty of the trial court to directly address 
the defendant and ensure the defendant’s right of allocution is 
upheld.  See State v. Schaefer, 117 Hawai i 490, 498, 184 P.3d 
805, 813 (App. 2008) (“ We know of no effective or adequate 
manner in which a defendant ’s right of presentence allocution 
may be constitutionally realized than to affirmatively require 
that the trial court make direct inquiry of the defendant ’s wish 
to address the court before sentence is imposed. ” (quoting Chow , 
77 Hawai i at 247 , 883 P.2d at  669)).  This duty is also imposed 
on the trial court by the language of HRS §  706-604(1), which, 
as noted above, provides t hat “the court shall afford a fair 
opportunity to the defendant to be heard on the issue of the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
20 
 defendant’s disposition.”  ( Emphasis added. )  HRPP Rule 32(a) 
uses similar mandatory language, instructing that “before 
suspending or imposing sentence, the court shall  address the 
defendant personally .”  (Emphasis added. )   
  As stated, the right of presentence allocution is an 
important constitutional right guaranteed under the due process 
clause of the Hawai i Constitution.  Hernandez, 143 
Hawaii at 
509, 431 P.3d at 1282.  We have observed  that “procedural due 
process requires that a person have an ‘opportunity to be heard 
at a meaningful ti me and in a meaningful manner.’”   In re 
Application of Maui Elec. Co., 141 Hawai i 249, 269, 408 P.3d 1, 
21 (2017) (quoting Freitas v. Admin. Dir. of Courts, 108 Hawai i 
31, 44, 116 P.3d 673, 686 ( 2005)).  As a due process right, a 
defendant’s right of allocution is violated if the court fails 
to afford the defendant an opportunity to exercise the right at 
a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.  See , e.g., 
Carvalho, 90 Hawai i at 286, 978 P.2d at 724 (a sentencing court 
must afford a defendant the right of presentence 
allocution “before ruling on the applicability of the young 
adult defendants statute ”).  In order to be meaningful, the 
opportunity for allocution must be reasonably calculated to 
achieve its purposes of  providing  the defendant with an 
opportunity to plead for mitigation, contest the factual bases ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
21 
 for sentencing, and acknowledge wrongdoing .  See Chow, 77 Hawai i 
at 250, 883 P.2d at 672. 
  In this case, the court provided Carlton the 
opportunity for allocution before the State specified which 
charges would be dismissed and which charge would be reinstated.  
Each of the potential charges, kidnapping, robbery, and assault, 
are predicated on different conduct and the  elements  of the 
offenses are not the same.   The robbery charge in particular 
involved conduct that was not encompassed by the kidnapping and 
assault charges.  Since Carlton did not know the offense he was 
to be sentenced on, he did not know which of his actions he 
needed to address and possibly provide explanation, mitigation, 
or take responsibility for.  Carlton was thus not afforded a 
meaningful opportunity to address the circumstances of the 
robbery offense because,  at the time of his allocution,  he did 
not know that this offense would provide the basis for the 
resentencing.  In essence, the court and the State put Carlton 
in the position of having to address three offenses although 
only one of them was to underlie the conviction  in this case . 
  The ICA found that Carlton waived any objection to the 
court’s violation of his due process right of allocution 
because, at the time of sentencing, Carlton was aware that the 
State had not elected the specific counts for dismissal and did 
not object at that time.  Although it is true that Carlton’s ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
22 
 counsel could have requested that Carlton be allowed to speak 
again, it was the duty of the court, not Carlton’s counsel, to 
afford Carlton a fair opportunity to be heard.  See  Grindling v. 
State, 144 Hawai i 444, 452 , 445 P.3d 25, 33 (2019) (“[A] trial 
court’s constitutional duty to engage the defendant in a 
colloquy . . . does not devolve upon defense counsel when the 
court does not fulfill its responsibility. ”); HRS § 706-604(1); 
HRPP Rule 32(a).  Therefore, Car lton’s failure to object at his 
resentencing hearing did not constitute a waiver of his due 
process right of allocation.   
  As stated, in order to  have a meaningful opportunity 
to exercise his right of allocution, Carlton  needed to know the 
offense for which he would be sentenced before he made his 
statement to the court.  I t is the duty of the sentencing court 
to ensure a defendant’s right of allocution can  be exercised in 
an informed and knowing manner at the time the defendant 
addresses the court.  We  hold that by failing to afford Carlton 
an opportunity to make a statement after he was  apprised of the 
offense for which he would be sentenced, the circuit court 
violated Carlton’s right of allocution as guaranteed by the due 
process clause, article I, 
section 5, of the Constitution of the 
State of Hawai i.

 2. Allowing the Defendant the  Last Word Before Sentence  Is 
Imposed Is an Element  of Sound Judicial Administration 
  In addition to being unable to address the offense of 
conviction, Carlton had no oppor tunity to controvert the State’s 
sentencing argument or supplement the statements of defense 
counsel regarding his conduct while incarcerated.    
 
 The timing of the court’s invitation to the defendant 
to speak regarding all factual matters presented to the court is  
unquestionably significant to the meaningfulness of the right of 
allocution.  See, e.g. , Carvalho , 90 Hawai i at 286, 978 P.2d at 
724.  In Carvalho , the sentencing court did not afford Carvalho 
an opportunity to be heard before denying his request for 
sentencing as a young adult defendant.  Id .  We held that, by 
not providing Carvalho an opportunity to be heard before ruling 
on the applicability of the young adult sentencing statute, the 
sentencing court had denied Carvalho his right of allocution.  
We stated that the “ right of allocution is designed to provide 
an opportunity to affect the totality of the trial court ’s 
sentencing determination.”  Id. at 286, 978 P.2d at 724. 
  Manifestly, the statements of counsel at a sentencing 
hearing that contain factual assertions can significantly impact 
the court’s application of the sentencing factors set forth in 
HRS § 706 -606.  In this case, after Carlton addressed the court, 
both counsel made arguments about whether and to what extent the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
24  
(continued. . .)  
 court should consider Carlton’s conduct while incarcerated, what 
level of premeditation was involved in the offense, and whether 
consecutive or concurrent sentences should be imposed.  The 
court did not speak directly to Carlton after the arguments were 
completed.  Th is omission denied Carlton an opportunity to 
affect the totality of the c ourt’s sentencing determination as 
Carlton was not able to controvert the statements made by the 
State about his asserted premeditation 
in the offense  of 
conviction or supplement the statements of defense counsel 
regarding his conduct while incarcerated-- matters on which 
Carlton may have been able to provide additional information to 
the court.   
  
This ability to controvert,  correct, or supplement 
factual representations made by counsel is similar to a 
defendant’s right to controvert or supplement the presentence 
investigation report (PSI), as provided by HRS § 706-604(2) 
(Supp. 2006).10  The statute requires the court to furnish the 
                         
 10 HRS § 706-604(2) states the following:  
 
The court shall furnish to the defendant or the defendant ’s 
counsel and to the prosecuting attorney a copy of the 
report of any pre -sentence diagnosis or psychological, 
psychiatric, or other medical examination and  afford fair 
opportunity, if the defendant or the prosecuting attorney 
so requests, to controvert or supplement them.  The court 
shall amend or order the amendment of the report upon 
finding that any correction, modification, or addition is 
needed and, where appropriate, shall require the prompt 
preparation of an amended report in which material required 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
25 (continued. . .)   
 parties with a copy of the PSI and afford fair opportunity for 
the parties to controvert or supplement it .  State v. Phua, 135  
Hawaii 504, 517 n.21, 353 P.3d 1046, 1059 n.21 (2015).  This 
provision is designed to protect defendants from unfounded facts 
and derogatory information by requiring notice and an 
opportunity to controvert the information.  State v. Barrios
, 
139 Hawai i 321, 331, 389 P.3d 916, 926 ( 2016).  This ensures 
that the court or other entity making a decision about a 
defendant’s sentence  be given, and relies upon, the most 
accurate information available.  The ability to controvert or 
supplement the PSI is particularly critical because of its many 
uses in the criminal justice process.  See generally , HRS § 806-
73(b)(3) (Supp. 2005);11 HRS § 706-604(4) (Supp. 2006).12   
                                                                               
(. . . continued) 
 
to be deleted is completely removed or other amendments, 
including additions, are made.  
 
 11 HRS § 806-73(b)(3) provides as follows:  
 
(3) A copy of a presentence report or investigative report 
shall be provided only to:  
(A) The persons or entities named in section 706 -604; 
(B) The Hawaii paroling authority;  
(C) Any psychiatrist, psychologist, or other treatment 
practitioner who is treating the defendant  pursuant to a 
court order or parole order for that treatment;  
(D) The intake service centers;  
(E) In accordance with applicable law, persons or entities 
doing research; and  
(F) Any Hawaii state adult probation officer or adult 
probation officer of another  state or federal jurisdiction 
who: 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
26 
   Like the PSI,  the statements of counsel at the 
sentencing hearing may influence the court’s sentencing 
determination.  In order to ensure the defendant is afforded a 
meaningful opportunity to address all information before the 
court and to affect the 
totality of the trial court ’s sentencing 
determination, the defendant should be given the opportunity to 
make a statement to the court after both counsel have completed 
their sentencing arguments.13  Failing to afford the defendant 
this opportunity undermines the defendant ’s ability to  
controvert or supplement factual assertions made during the 
proceeding.  Additionally,  the statements of counsel at the 
sentencing hearing have relevance beyond the initial sentencing 
determination because transcripts of sentencing hearings may be  
used in subsequent proceedings.  See,  e.g., De La Garza v. 
                                                                               
(. . . continued) 
 
(i) Is engaged in the supervision of a defendant or 
offender convicted and sentenced in the courts of Hawaii; 
or 
(ii) Is engaged in the preparation of a report for a court 
regarding a defendant or offender convicted and sentenced 
in the courts of Hawaii[.]  
 
 12 HRS § 706-604(4) provides as follows: “If the defendant is 
sentenced to imprisonment, a copy of the report of any pre -sentence diagnosis 
or psychological, psychiatric, or other medical examination, which shall 
incorporate any amendments ordered by the court, shall be transmitted 
immediately to the department of public safety.”  
 
 13 If other persons aside from counsel address  the court at 
sentencing, this should occur prior to the defendant’s allocution.  See, 
e.g., HRS § 706-604(3) (2014 & Supp. 2016 ) (“[T]he court shall afford a fair 
opportunity to the victim to be heard on the issue of the defendant’s 
disposition, before imposing sentence.”).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
27 
 State, 129 Hawai i 429, 433, 302 P.3d 697, 701 (2013) (noting 
that the prosecutor referenced statements m ade at defendant’s 
sentencing hearing at a minimum term hearing before the Hawaii 
Paroling Authority (HPA)) ; State v. Garcia, 135 Hawaii 361, 366,
351 P.3d 588, 593 (2015) (discussing how sentencing hearing 
transcripts can be presented to the HPA);  State v. Fogel, 95 
Hawaii 398, 403, 23 P.3d 733, 738 (2001) (stating that the 
circuit court reviewed the transcript of the sentencing hearing 
when ruling upon defendant ’s motion to reconsider sentence).    
  W e have stated that courts should, “ as a matter of 
good judicial administration, unambiguously address themselves 
to the defendant providing a personal invitation to speak prior 
to sentencing. ”  Phua, 135 Hawai i at 517, 353 P.3d at 105
9 
(internal quotations omitted).  This court, as well as the ICA, 
has indicated that the sentencing court should give the 
defendant an opportunity to speak just before sentence is 
imposed by stating that “[t]he right is one easily administered 
. . . by the following inquiry: ‘ Do you, . . . [(defendant ’s 
name)], have anything to say before I pass sentence?’”  Id. 
(some alterations in original) (quoting Chow, 77 Hawaii at 248, 
883 P.2d at 670).  It is noted, however, that due process does 
not necessarily demand that a defendant be given the last word 
in all circumstances.  See , e.g., State v. Nicholson, 120 Hawaii ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
28 
 480, 486, 210 P.3d 3, 9 (App. 2009) (affirming circuit court’s 
refusal to allow defendant a second allocution after the court 
expressed disbelief in response to defendant’s statement when 
imposing sentence).  Nevertheless , prudential judicial 
administration instructs that the defendant be given the last 
word before sentencing 
is imposed in order to avoid eroding the 
meaningfulness of the defendant’s  right of allocution .  Under 
the circumstances presented in this case, the failure to provide 
Carlton an opportunity to speak after counsel completed their 
arguments clearly impaired Carlton ’s ability to controvert or 
supplement the statements of counsel.   
 
 Given our holding that Carlton’s due process right of 
allocution was violated by the court’s failure to require timely 
disclosure of the offens e for which he would be sentenced, i t is 
unnecessary to determine whether the court’s failure to provide 
Carlton the opportunity to controvert or supplement the 
statements of counsel also rose to the level of a due process, 
statutory, or rule violation  that requires resentencing.   
However, we reiterate that sound  judicial administration 
requires that the sentencing court afford the defendant an 
opportunity for allocution after the arguments of counsel are 
complete and before sentence is imposed.  Phua, 135 Hawai i at 
517, 353 P.3d at 1059.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 IV. CONCLUSION 
  Based on the forego ing, we vacate in part and affirm  
in part the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal entered on July 11, 2019  
(ICA judgment) and the circuit court judgment.  The sentence set 
forth in the circuit court judgment and affirmed by the ICA 
judgment are vacated, and the case is 
remanded  to the circuit 
court for resentencing before a different judge.  We otherwise 
affirm the ICA judgment and the circuit court judgment for the 
reasons stated herein.
