SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By:  Nakayama, Acting C.J., McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ., and 
Circuit Judge Browning, in place of Recktenwald, C.J., recused)  
 
  Petitioner/Appellant-Defendant James Thompson 
(“Thompson”) challenges the credit given him at resentencing for 
time he served subsequent to his 2001 conviction and sentencing 
for seven counts of sexual assault in the first degree ( Hawaiʻi 
Revised Statutes ( “
HRS”) § 707-730(1)(a) (1993)); two counts of 
attempted sexual assault in the first degree (HRS §§ 705- 500 
(1993) and 707-730(1)(a)); eight counts of sexual assault in the Electronically Filed

 third degree (HRS § 707- 732(1)(e)(1993)); two  counts of 
kidnapping (HRS § 707- 720(1)(d)(1993)); and one count of sexual 
assault in the fourth degree (HRS § 707- 733(1)(a)(1993)).   For 
his original sentence in 2001, Thompson recei ved nine terms of 
life with the possibility of parole, two twenty- year terms, 
eight ten-year terms, and a single one- year term to be served 
concurrently for a maximum sentence of life with the possibili ty 
of parole (“2001 sentence”).    
  Following a successful habeas corpus petition, the 
United States District Court for the District of Hawai ‘i  (“U.S. 
District Court”)  vacated Thompson’s 2001 sentence because the 
sentences comprising the 2001 sentence were extended beyond the 
statutory maximum based on facts found by a judge, not a jury, 
in violation of the U nited States Supreme Court’s holding in 
Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000).  Thompson v. 
Thomas, No. CIV. 08-00218 SOM, 2012 WL 3777143, at *1 (D. Haw. 
Aug. 29, 2012).1  At resentencing in 2017, the Circuit Court o f 
the First Circuit of the State of Hawai ʻi (“circuit court”) 
imposed a consecutive sentence comprised of four increments:  
three twenty-year terms and a single one-year term to be served 
consecutively, for a total sentence of sixty
-one years 
                     
1   On March 18, 2014, the order of the U.S. District Court was affirmed by 
the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.  Thompson v. Thomas, 564 Fed. Appx. 316, 
2014 WL 1017044 (9th. Cir. 2014) (Mem.).  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATIO N IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 imprisonment (“2017 resentence”).   The circuit court indicated 
that Thompson’s credit for time served under the 2001 sentence 
would be applied only once against the first of his three 
consecutive twenty-year terms. 
  
On appeal, Thompson correctly contends his 2017 
resentencing failed to give him full credit for time he served 
on his 2001 sentence.  The credit was applied only to the sixty-
one year combined total sentence rather than to each of
 the 
offenses comprising his 2017 resentence .2    At the time of his

resentence:

 resentencing in 2017, Thompson had served seventeen years on all 
of his concurrent sentences.3   
  Under HRS § 706- 671(2), “when a judgment of conviction 
or a sentence is vacated and a new sentence is thereafter 
imposed upon the defendant for the same crime, the period of 
detention and imprisonment theretofore served shall be deducted 
from the minimum a nd maximum terms of the new sentence.”  The 
reference in HRS § 706- 671(2) to “minimum and maximum terms” 
denotes the minimum term set by the Hawaiʻi paroling a uthority 
pursuant to HRS § 706- 6694 and the statutory maximum term for 
each count.  State v. Martin, 71 Haw. 73, 74, 783 P.2d 292, 293 
(1989) (explaining that “[t]hese words ‘minimum and maximum 
terms’ refer to the minimum term of imprisonment to be 
determined by the paroling authority, see  HRS § 706 –669 (1985), 
                     
3  Thus, Thompson  had fully served his eight (concurrent) ten -year 
extended sentences for counts 9 -11, 15-17, 20 and 21, as well as his 
(concurrent) one year sentence on  count 13 ; he had served seventeen years of  
his (concurrent) twenty- year extended sentences for counts 12 and 22 ; and he 
had served seventeen years with respect to his nine (concurrent) terms of 
life with the possibility of parole.  
 
4  HRS § 706- 669 provides in relevant part:   
 
When a person has been sentenced to an indeterminate or an 
extended term of imprisonment, the Hawai ʻi paroling 
authority shall, as soon as practicable but no later than 
six months after commitment to the custody of the director 
of the department of [public safety] hold a hearing, and on 
the basis of the hearing make an order fixing the minimum 
term of imprisonment to be served before the prisoner shall 
become eligible for parole.  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATIO N IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 and the maximum length of imprisonm
ent, determined under [the 
relevant penal statute] for defendant[’s conviction.]” ).   
  Although HRS § 706 -671(2) does not specify how time 
served under concurrent sentences should be credited against 
consecutive sentences imposed on resentencing, it is significant 
that the statute requires that the defendant be credited with 
time served with respect to the “same crime.”  Id.  When the 
defendant has accrued time served against multiple crimes, the 
wording of HRS § 706- 671(2) suggests that on resentencing for 
those same crimes, the defendant is entitled to credit against 
each of those same crimes, rather than only once against the 
aggregate of the consecutive sentences.  See  State v. Brant , 72 
Haw. 230, 232, 813 P.2d 854, 855 (1991) (noting that “nothing in 
the statute allows a court discretion to decide whether to 
credit time already served for the same offense.  Section 706-
671 clearly mandates credit for time served in detention or  
imprisonment when a sentence is vacated and [a] new sentence is 
thereafter imposed.”).5 
                     
5  Subsection (1) of HRS § 706 -671 governs credit for time served by the 
defendant from the time of arrest until the imposition of the initial 
sentence.  HRS § 706 -671(1) provides in relevant part:  
  
When a defendant who is sentenced to imprisonment has 
previously been detained in any State or local correctional 
or other institution following the defendant’s arrest for  
the crime for which sentence is imposed, such period of 
detention following the defendant’s arrest shall be *** NOT FOR PUBLICATIO N IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

(continued . . .)  
 
deducted from the minimum and maximum terms of such 
sentence.  
 
 We interpreted and applied subsection (1) in State v. Tauiliili, where 
we held that “credit for presentence imprisonment  is properly granted against 
only the aggregate of the consecutive sentence terms.”  96 Hawai ʻi 195, 197 –
99, 29 P.3d 914, 916 –18 (2001)(emphasis added).  We have not, however, 
previously had occasion to decide whether the statutory mandate contained in 
subsection (2) of HRS § 706 -671 requires that, on resentencing after the 
original sentence has been vacated, credit for time served is properly 
granted against only the aggregate of the consecutive sentence terms.  
 
 In Tauiliili, we relied on the Commentary to HRS § 706 -671 in reaching 
our decision that credit for presentence imprisonment should only  be applied 
once against the aggregate of the consecutive sentences:  
 
The commentary to HRS § 706 -671 states in relevant part 
that “[t]his section provides for a result which the Code 
deems fair” and “provides for some equalization ... between 
those defendants who obtain pre -sentence release and those 
who do not.”  Statutes giving credit for presentence 
confinement were designed to ensure equal treatment of all 
defendants whether or not they are incarcerated prior to 
conviction.  [In Re Atiles , 33 Cal.3d 805, 808, 662 P.2d 
910, 911 (Cal. 1983)].  [G]ranting presentence credit, 
therefore, seeks to place an in -custody criminal defendant 
who cannot afford to post bail in the same position as his 
counterpart with bail money. Nissel v. Pearce , 307 Or. 102, 
764 P.2d 224, 226 (1988).  
 
Tauiliili at 198–99, 29 P.3d at 917– 18.  This rationale – i.e., the need “to 
place an in- custody criminal defendant who cannot afford to post bail in the 
same position as his counterpart with bail money” – is plainly inapplicable 
to subsection (2) of HRS § 706 -671.  Subsection (2) does not involve credit 
for time served in presentence detainment, rather it deals with credit for 
time served after  the imposition of the vacated sentence, and thus there is 
no risk that applying credit for time served against each of the consecutive 
sentences rather than only against the aggregate of the consecutive sentences 
“would [] defeat the purpose of ‘equalization’ noted in the commentary to HRS 
§ 706-671 (1993).” Id. at 199, 29 P.3d at 918.  
 
 The issue presented by the instant case therefore is readily 
distinguishable from the issue we decided in Tauiliili.  Id.  Thompson’s case 
deals with “credit for imprisonment under [an] earlier sentence for same 
crime[,]” while Tauiliili  dealt with “[c]redit for time of detention prior to 
sentence” (“presentence credit”).   Compare  HRS § 706- 671(1), with HRS § 706 -
671(2).   
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATIO N IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 Moreover, an interpretation of subsection (2) of HRS § 
706-671 that applied credit for time served only once against 
the aggregate of consecutive sentences imposed on resentencing 
would raise very serious double jeopardy issues.  The double 
jeopardy clause in article I, section 10 of the Hawai ‘i 
Constitution6 affords the same protections as does the United 
States Constitution’s Fifth Amendment guarantee7 that no person 
“be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of 
life or limb[.] ”  State v. Taparra, 82 Hawai‘i 83, 89, 919 P.2d 
995, 1001 (Ct. App. 1996).  The United States Supreme Court held 
in North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 717, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 
2076 (1969), that “[t]he Constitution was designed as much to 
prevent the criminal from being twice punished for the same 
                     
6  Article I, section 10, of the Hawai ʻi Constitution provides  in relevant 
part:
 
 
No person shall be held to answer for a capital or 
otherwise  infamous crime, unless on a presentment or 
indictment of a grand jury or upon a finding of probable 
cause after a preliminary hearing held as provided by law, 
except in cases arising in the armed forces when in actual 
service in time of war or public danger; nor shall any 
person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in 
jeopardy[.]  
 
7  The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution  provides in 
relevant part: 
 
No person shall be held to answer for a capital or 
otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or 
indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the 
land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual 
service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any 
person be subject for the same offen ce to be twice put in 
jeopardy of life or limb[.]  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATIO N IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 offence as from being twice tried for it” and the guarantee 
against double jeopardy “is violated when [imprisonment] a lready 
exacted for an offense is not fully ‘credited’ in imposing 
sentence upon a new conviction for the same offense.”  Taparra 
at 89, 919 P.2d at 1001 (quoting Pearce , 395 U.S. at 718).  As 
such “[t]he time already served in prison by a defendant must be  
credited ‘by subtracting [it] from whatever new sentence is 
imposed.’”  Id. (quoting Pearce, 395 U.S. at 719).  
  Absent credit for time already served on each count of 
his 2001 sentence,  Thompson would be subjected to 
unconstitutional “multiple punishments” for the same offense.  
Taparra at 89, 919 P.2d at 1001.  As the United S tates Supreme 
Court observed in Pearce , “the constitutional guarantee against 
multiple punishments for the same offense absolutely requires 
that punishment already exacted must be fully ‘credited’ in 
imposing sentence . . . for the same offense.”  Pearce, 395 U.S. 
at 718-19.  Accordingly, Thompson must “absolutely” receive full 
credit for the time that he served on each count of the 2001 
sentence.  Specifically, the time Thompson se
rved under his 2001 
sentence (approximately seventeen years) must be credited 
against the statutory maximum term for each count under which he 
was resentenced in 2017.  HRS § 706- 671(2).  Anything less would 
be a violation of Thompson’s constitutional righ ts under the 
double jeopardy clause of article I, section 10 of the Hawai ʻi *** NOT FOR PUBLICATIO N IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 Constitution and the 
Fifth Amendment t o the United States 
Constitution.   
  
 Following the setting aside of Thompson’s 2001 
sentence by the U. S. District Court, the circuit court at 
resentencing in 2017 imposed new sentences for counts Thompson 
had fully served under the  2001 sentence.  W ith respect to count 
13 of the 2001 sentence (one- year imprisonment for misdemeanor 
sex assault 4, served concurrently with all other counts), 
Thompson had completed the sentence by the time of his 
resentencing in 2017.  However, at resentencing in 2017, 
Thompson was again sentenced to one-year incarceration on count 
13, with the sentence to be served consecutively to the three 
twenty-year consecutive terms.   Similarly, the circuit court at 
resentencing in 2017 reimposed sentences for eight
 class C 
felony counts stemming from his 2001 convictions.8  The statutory 
maximum sentence of five years ’ incarceration was imposed for 
each of the eight counts;9 per the 2001  extended sentence,  he had 
received ten years of incarceration for each count —all eight to 
                     
8  Sex assault 3  (HRS § 707- 732(1)(e)(1993) ) in counts 9 -11, 15-17, and 
20-21. 
 
9  HRS § 706- 660 provides that the  term of imprisonment for a class C 
felony is five years.  HRS § 706 -660(1)(b).  
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATIO N IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

(continued . . .)  
 
 be served concurrently.10  Likewise, for the class B felonies in 
counts 12 and 22, Thompson received extended terms  of twenty 
years for each count in 2001 and the statutory maximum of ten 
years’ incarceration at resentencing in 2017.   Thus, by the time 
Thompson was resentenced in 2017 he had fully served the maximum 
one-year statutory sentence for the misdemeanor in co unt 13, the 
five-year statutory maximum sentences for class C felonies in 
counts 9-11, 15-17, and 20 -21, and the two statutory maximum 
sentences of ten years for the class  B felonies in counts 12 and 
22. 
  As explained above, Thompson was resentenced in 2017 
for nine class A felony offenses (counts 1 -4, 6-8, 14, and 19) .    
The statutory maximum sentence for a class A felony is “an 
indeterminate term of imprisonment of twenty years” and the 
“minimum length of imprisonment shall  be determined by the 
Hawai‘i
 paroling authority in accordance with section 706-669.”  
HRS § 706-659.11  Thus, under the 2001 sentence, Thompson had 
                     
10   HRS § 706- 661 provides that an extended term of imprisonment for a 
class C felony is ten years.  HRS § 706 -661(4). 
 
11  Thompson’s approximately seventeen years credit also  must be deducted 
from his minimum sentence as calculated by the Hawai ʻi paroling a uthority 
pursuant to HRS § 706 -669.   It appears that Thompson’s appeal was filed prior 
to the Hawaiʻ i paroling authority completing its calculation of Thompson’s 
minimum sentence and the calculation is therefore not in the record.  
Although the record does not reflect the Hawai ʻi paroling authorit y’s 
calculations for the minimum sentence Thompson must serve under his 2017 
resentence, Thompson is correct that the credit he accrued on each count of *** NOT FOR PUBLICATIO N IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
11 
 served seventeen years
 of the twenty-year statutory maximum in 
counts 1-8, 14, and 19.  
  Accordingly, at the time of resentencing, Thompson had 
fully served the statutory maximum sentences for all but his 
class A felony sentences, for which he had three years remaining 
on the total indeterminate term of each  sentence.   See HRS § 
706-671(2).  Thus, in his 2017  resentence,  Thompson had three 
years of incarceration remaining on counts 1-4 and 6- 8 (ordered 
to run concurrently); three years’ incarceration remaining on 
count 14 to be served consecutively;  and three years remaining 
on count 19 to be served consecutively .  In total, after 
correctly calculating the credit for time served under HRS § 
706-671(2), Thompson had an aggregate maximum remaining sentence 
of approximately nine years at the time of resentencing on April 
28, 2017.  Because the sentences under counts 1- 4 and 6-8 run 
consecutive to count 14 and consecutive to count 19, the 
approximately three years that have elapsed since Thompson’s 
resentencing are counted only once against the aggregate of his 
consecutive sentences .  As such, Thompson has approximately six 
                     
(continued . . .)  
 
his 2001 concurrent sentences  must be applied to the minimum term set by the 
Hawai‘i
  paroling authority for each count.  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATIO N IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
12 
 years remaining on his aggregate maximum term of imprisonment on 
the date this disposition was issued.  
  In asmuch as the ICA’s September 26, 2018 memorandum 
opinion implicitly affirmed the circuit court’s calculation of 
Thompson’s credit for time  served under his 2001 sentence 
without accurately applying HRS § 706- 671(2), we vacate the 
ICA’s judgment on appeal and remand the case to the circuit 
court for an accurate calculation of his credit for time served.
