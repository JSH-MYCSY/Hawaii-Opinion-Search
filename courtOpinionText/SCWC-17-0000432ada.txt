 I. Introduction  
 This case arises out of the State of Hawai‘i Department of 
Human Services’ (“DHS ”) attempt to recover payments made to 
Frederick Nitta, M.D. (“Dr. Nitta”) from its Medicaid Primary 
Care Physician Program (“the Program”).  The Program was 
established by a federal statute within the Affordable Care Act 
(“ACA”), specifically 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(13)(C)(“the 
Statute”).  The Statute enabled physicians “with a primary 
specialty designation of family medicine, general internal 
medicine, or pediatric medicine” to temporarily receive 
increased payments for primary care services provided to 
Medicaid patients in 2013 and 2014.  DHS, through its Med -QUEST 
division, administers the Program in the State of Hawai‘i. 
 Dr. Nitta, who has been board -certified in obstetrics and 
gynecology (“OB/GYN”) since the early 1990’s, but who has been 
serving as a pr imary care physician (“PCP”) to Medicare and 
Medicaid patients in East Hawaiʻi for many years, became a 
participant in the Program when a staff member signed him up on -
line at the suggestion of an AlohaCare representative.  In 2015, 
however, DHS told Dr. Nitta he was ineligible because he did not 
meet specialty requirements for Pr ogram participants as set 
forth in a federal administrative rule, 42 C.F.R. § 447.400 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  **

 (“the Rule”) .  DHS then demanded repayment of more than $200,000 
in enhanced payments received by Dr. Nitta through the Program.   
 Dr. Nitta requested an administrative hearing and an 
administrative appeal at DHS.  He later filed for a judicial 
appeal by the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit (“circuit 
court”).  All deemed Dr. Nitta ineligible.  Dr. Nitta then 
brought a secondary appeal to the Intermediate Court of Appeal s 
(“ICA”).  
 While the ICA appeal was pending, the Court of Appeals for 
the Sixth Circuit issued an opinion invalidating the Rule.  
Averett v. United States Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs. , 943 F.3d 
313, 319 (6th Cir. 2019).  In a published opinion, the ICA 
adopted the Sixth Circuit’s analysis in Averett.  Nitta v. Dep ’t 
of Hum. Servs., 151 Hawaiʻi 123, 128, 508 P.3d 1209, 1214 (App. 
2022).  Because DHS and the circuit court had relied on the 
invalidated Rule to order repayment by Dr. Nitta, the ICA 
ordered a remand to DHS for further proceedings as may be 
necessary.  Nitta, 151 Hawaiʻi at 129, 50 8 P.3d at 1215.  
 On certiorari, DHS does not contest the Sixth Circuit and 
ICA’s invalidation of the Rule.  Instead, DHS argues the ICA 
erred because (1) Dr. Nitta was still ineligible for the Program 
under the Statute; (2) the circuit court had also relie d on the 
Statute in deeming Dr. Nitta ineligible; and (3) DHS is required ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ** 
 
4 
 to recoup the overpayment because there was never money 
appropriated to pay Dr. Nitta.   
 With respect to the first issue, the ICA did not address 
whether Dr. Nitta would in any even t be precluded from enhanced 
payments based on the Statute.  In Averett, the Sixth Circuit 
held the Statute’s phrase, “physician with a primary specialty 
designation,” to mean “ a physician who has himself designated, 
as his primary specialty, one of the sp ecialties recited in [the 
Statute].”  Averett, 943 F.3d at 31 9.  The ICA adopted this 
holding, Nitta, 151 Hawaiʻi at 128, 508 P.3d at 1214 , but did not 
address whether Dr. Nitta qualified.  
 We agree with DHS that Dr. Nitta’s eligibility for the 
Program under the Statute can and should be addressed.  We also 
agree with the Sixth Circuit and the ICA that the Rule is  
invalid as it contravenes the Statute.  Contrary to DHS’s 
position, however, we hold Dr. Nitta was entitled to enhanced 
payments under the Statute based on the reasoning below .  
 This holding resolves D HS’s second issue on certiorari, 
that the circuit cou rt had also relied on the Statute to hold 
Dr. Nitta ineligible.  If the circuit court had so held, it 
would have been wrong.  But, in any event, the circuit court 
(and DHS) relied solely on the invalidated Rule in deeming Dr. 
Nitta ineligible and did not r ely on the Statute.   ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ** 
 
5 
   
. . . .  Finally, we also reject DHS’s third issue on certiorari, 
that DHS is required to recoup the overpayment because there was 
never money appropriated to pay Dr. Nitta.  This is a new 
argument never raised below and is therefore waived.  
  Hence, we vacate the ICA’s March 23, 2022 judgment on 
appeal to the extent it remanded the case “to the DHS 
Administrative Appeals Office for further proceedings as may be 
necessary.”  We otherwise affirm the ICA’s judgment on appeal.  
II. Background  
A.  Factual Background  
 1. The Program  
 As explained by the ICA, Medicaid provides medical 
assistance to qualifying individuals and families, and is 
jointly funded and administered by the federal and state 
governments.  Nitta, 151 Hawaiʻi at 124, 508 P.3d at 1210.  In 
2010, Congress enacted the ACA and also temporarily increased 
payments in 2013 and 2014 to certain physicians who provided 
primary-care services to Medicaid patients.   Id.  Specifically, 
the Statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(13)(C), allowed for such 
increased payments provided “by a physician with a primary 
specialty designation of family medicine, general internal 
medicine, or pediatric medicine.”   The Statute provides:  
(a)  A State plan for medical assistance must — ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ** 
 
6 
    
 (13) provide— 
   
. . . . 
 
(C) payment for primary care services (as 
defined in subsection (jj)) furnished in 2013 
and 2014 by a physician with a primary 
specialty designation of family medicine, 
general internal medicine, or pediatric 
medicine at a rate not less than 100 perce nt of 
the payment rate that applies to such services 
and physician under part B of subchapter XVIII 
(or, if greater, the payment rate that would be 
applicable under such part if the conversion 
factor under  section 1395w-4(d) of this title 
for the year involved were the conversion 
factor under such section for 2009)[.]1 
 
 As further explained by the ICA, the Centers for Medicare 
and Medicaid Services (“ CMS”) administers Medicaid, and 
promulgated th e Rule, 42 C.F.R. § 447.400, further delineating 
physician eligibility for the Program.  Nitta, 151 Hawaiʻi at 
125, 508 P.3d at 1211.  The Rule set out a board certification 
                                                           
1  42 U.S.C. § 1396a(jj) then provides:  
 
  (jj) Primary care services  defined 
For purposes of subsection (a)(13)(C), the term  
“primary care services” means — 
  
(1) evaluation and management services that are 
procedure codes (for services covered under 
subchapter XVIII) for services in the category 
designated Eva luation and Management in the 
Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System 
(established by the Secretary under  section 1395w-
4(c)(5) of this title as of December 31, 2009, and as 
subsequently modifi ed); and  
(2) services related to immunization administration 
for vaccines and toxoids for which CPT codes 90465, 
90466, 90467, 90468, 90471, 90472, 90473, or 90474 
(as subsequently modified) apply under such System.  ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ** 
 
7 
 (continued. . .)  or a sixty -percent billing threshold requirement, requiring 
that:  
(a) [s]tates pa y for services furnished by a physician as 
defined in § 440.50 of this chapter, or under the personal 
supervision of a physician who self -attests to a specialty 
designation of family medicine, general internal medicine 
or pediatric medicine or a subspecial ty recognized by the 
American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS), the American 
Board of Physician Specialties (ABPS) or the American 
Osteopathic Association (AOA). Such physician then attests 
that [they]:  
 
(1) [Are] Board Certified with such a specialty o r 
subspecialty and/or  
 
(2) Has furnished evaluation and management services 
and vaccine administration services under codes 
described in paragraph (b) of this section that equal 
at least 60 percent of the Medicaid codes he or she 
has billed during the most  recently completed CY or, 
for newly eligible physicians, the prior month.  
 
42 C.F.R. § 447.400(a).  Nitta, 151 Hawaiʻi at 125, 508 P. 3d at 
1211.  
 Thus, the Statute allowed for enhanced payments to “a 
physician with a primary specialty designation of family 
medicine, general internal medicine, or pediatric medicine.”  
The Rule, however, further required physicians to s elf-attest to 
a specialty designation of family medicine, general internal 
medicine or pediatric medicine and then also attest that they 
are board -certified in one of those designations (or a 
recognized subspecialty2) or show that at least sixty percent of  
their billings were for the provision of PCP services.   
                                                           
2  According to the American Board of Medical Specialties, the 
subspecialties of family medicine are adolescent medicine, geriatric ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  **

   In Hawai‘i, pursuant to the Rule, DHS required physicians 
seeking enhanced payments to complete a form on its website 
self-attesting to those requirements (“self -attestation form”). 
The form tracke d Rule requirements and also said it could not be 
completed by anyone on the provider’s behalf.  Nitta, 151 Hawaiʻi 
at 125, 508 P.3d at 1211.   
2. Dr. Nitta’s involvement with the Program  
 Dr. Nitta was board -certified as an OB/GYN in the early 
1990’s and h as practiced medicine in Hilo, Hawai‘i for many 
years.  When Dr. Nitta began practicing in 1993, he submitted an 
application to DHS to participate as a Medicaid provider, 
listing OB/GYN as his specialty.   In 2006, Dr. Nitta received 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
(continued. . .) 
medicine, hospice and palliative medicine, pain medicine, sleep medicine, 
sports medicine; the subspecialties of internal medicine are adolescent 
medicine, adult congenital heart disease, advanced heart failure and 
transplant cardiology, cardiovascular disease, clinical cardiac 
electrophysiology, critical care medicine, endocrinology, diabetes, and 
metabolism, gastroenterology, geriatric medicine, hematology, hospi ce and 
palliative medicine, infectious disease, interventional cardiology, medical 
oncology, nephrology, neurocritical care, pulmonary disease, rheumatology, 
sleep medicine, sports medicine, and transplant hepatology; and the 
subspecialties of pediatric me dicine are adolescent medicine, child abuse 
pediatrics, development -behavioral pediatrics, hospice and palliative 
medicine, medical toxicology, neonatal -perinatal medicine, pediatric 
cardiology, pediatric critical care medicine, pediatric emergency medicin e, 
pediatric endocrinology, pediatric gastroenterology, pediatric hematology -
oncology, pediatric hospital medicine, pediatric infectious diseases, 
pediatric nephrology, pediatric pulmonology, pediatric rheumatology, 
pediatric transplant hepatology, sleep m edicine, and sports medicine.  See

 his National Provider I dentifier, which also indicated a 
specialty of OB/GYN.3  
 More than ninety percent of Dr. Nitta’s patients, however, 
are eligible for Medicaid or Medicare and do not have other 
doctors.  Thus, although he is a board -certified OB/GYN 
physician, Dr. Nitta pr ovides PCP services for his patients, is 
recognized in the community as a PCP, and provides a broad range 
of services to his patients.    
 Hence, in 2013, at the suggestion of an AlohaCare 
representative, a staff member from Dr. Nitta’s office enrolled 
him in the Program via the DHS website.  The parties do not 
dispute that Dr. Nitta was attested to have a specialty 
designation of family medicine, general internal medicine, or 
pediatric medicine.  
It appears Dr. Nitta first learned he was participating in 
the Program when he received a letter from DHS dated July 7, 
2015 telling him he was ineligible because he did not satisfy 
Rule requirements.  Then, in a letter dated November 6, 2015, 
DHS demanded repayment of $205,940.13 in payments made to him 
via the Pr ogram.

below. ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  **

 B.  Procedural background  
 1. At DHS 
  a.  DHS administrative hearing decision  
 On December 4, 2015, Dr. Nitta submitted an administrative 
hearing request with DHS contesting the repayment demand.  On 
March 18, 2016, the parties participated in a hearing before a 
DHS hearing officer.4  On June 16, 2016, the hearing officer 
issued his decision in DHS’s favor and against Dr. Nitta.  In 
summary, the hearing officer ruled DHS was entitled to repayment 
because Dr. Nitta was board certified in OB/GYN, not in family 
medicine, general internal medicine, or pediatric medicine, and 
because Dr. Nitta had not met the sixty percent  billing 
requirement under the Rule.   
  b. DHS final decision  
 Dr. Nitta then sought an administrative appeal with DHS.  
On July 25, 2016, then -DHS Deputy Director Pankaj Bhanot issued 
DHS’s final decision, basically adopting the hearing officer’s 
decision.   
 This final decision, however, also included findings that 
HMSA, UnitedHealthcare, AlohaCare, and Hilo Medical Center all 
                                                           
4  The testifiers were Kurt Kresta, the DHS Financial Integrity Staff 
investigator in charge of Dr. Nitta’s case ; Dr. Nitta ; Dr. Lori Kanemoto, an 
OB/GYN familiar with Dr. Nitta an d his practice ; and Della Marie Shirota, a 
coding auditor for Hilo Medical Center, who opined Dr. Nitta was eligible for 
the enhanced payments.   ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ** 
 
11 
 identified Dr. Nitta as a PCP (with an OB/GYN specialization), 
and that Hilo Medical Center list ed Dr. Nitta as a PCP.   In 
addition, the final decision noted that community medical 
professionals identified Dr. Nitta as a PCP who practices in the 
areas of OB/G YN and primary care.  The DHS final decision 
ordered repayment from Dr. Nitta, however, based on his 
inability to meet Rule requirements for the Program.   
 2. Circuit court appeal (Civil No. 16 -1-0297) 
 Dr. Nitta then filed an appeal with the circuit cour t.  On 
April 12, 2017, the circuit court5 issued its decision and order.  
The circuit court noted that, under CMS guidance, physicians had 
to (1) self -attest to a specialty in one of the enumerated areas 
or in a recognized subspecialty; and (2) be board ce rtified in 
that specialty or subspecialty or meet the sixty percent billing 
threshold.  The circuit court ruled that (1) Dr. Nitta failed to 
meet the self -attestation requirement of the Program because his 
staff member had completed the attestation; (2) Dr . Nitta did 
not have a specialty or subspecialty designation in one of the 
requisite areas; (3) because Dr. Nitta was ineligible, there was 
no need to address DHS’s calculations regarding the sixty 
percent billing threshold; and (4) a review of the DHS 
overpayment calculations showed Dr. Nitta owed $205,338.88, not

12 
 (continued. . .)  $205,220.886.  The circuit court affirmed the DHS final decision 
and entered its judgment on May 9, 2017.   
 3.  ICA appeal 
  a. The appeal  
 On May 19, 2017, Dr. Nitta filed an appeal with the IC A. 
The parties basically repeated their arguments below.  
  b. Amicus brief (HMA & AMA)  
 The Hawaiʻi Medical Association (“HMA”) and the American 
Medical Association (“AMA”)  (“amici”) filed an amicus brief.  
Amici highlighted the critical and worsening physician shortage 
in Hawaiʻi, noting that primary care has the greatest shortage, 
especially for Med icaid patients in East Hawaiʻi.6  Amici posited 
                                                           
6  Citing articles and other reports, the amici explained that, o n 
neighbor islands in particular, patients often wait four to five months for a 
doctor’s appointment.  On Hawaiʻi Island, it is sometimes two to three times 
more difficult to find a PCP.  Consequently, many residents seek care at the 
nearest hospital emerg ency room, costing them “upward of $600 -$800 for an 
emergency room visit, as opposed to an average co -pay of $15 -$50 for a visit 
to a primary care physician.”   
 
 The amici attributed Hawaiʻi’s physician shortage to a number of issues:  
(1) having one of t he oldest physician workforces in the nation, meaning an 
exacerbated shortage as physicians retire; (2) Hawaiʻi’s high cost of living 
in conjunction with the costs of attending medical school; and (3) the lack 
of funding for physicians at hospitals and in private practice.  The last 
issue, in particular, limits the number of physicians a hospital is able to 
hire and forces physicians in private practice to adopt business models that 
exclude Medicaid patients.  In rural areas, the effect on Medicaid patients  
is even greater.   
 
 Also, according to the federal Health Resources and Services 
Administration, East Hawaiʻi, where Dr. Nitta practices, is a “Health 
Professional Shortage Area.”  Thus, Dr. Nitta is a physician who provides 
“vital services to vulnerable populations with limited access to medical 
care.”  Amici asserted DHS’s recoupment efforts against Dr. Nitta  jeopardizes ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ** 
 
13 
   that DHS’s continued recoupment efforts against physicians 
providing primary care services to Medicaid beneficiaries only 
worsens the shortage.  Amici also urged that the payments to Dr. 
Nitta were consistent  with the ACA’s purpose to “benefit 
physicians that provide primary care services to the Medicaid 
population.”7   
                                                                                                                                                                                           
(continued. . .) 
his ability to continue his practice, threatening to further reduce the 
already limited number of PCPs in the area.   
 
7  According to amici, DHS “arbitrarily determined that medical directory 
listings were the deciding factor of a physician’s  practice 
characteristics [.]”  Amici also argued that DHS arbitrarily and capriciously 
interpreted and applied the Rule by providing DHS with “unfettered discretion 
to determine physician eligibility.”  They pointed to Questions and Answers 
(“Q&As”) publis hed by CMS regarding how states might review physician 
eligibility for the Program.  There, the CMS provided a non -exhaustive list 
of ways a state could verify a physician’s practice characteristics (i.e., 
how the physician represented himself in the commu nity, medical directory 
listings, billings to other insurers, advertisements, etc.).  Amici contended 
other evidence demonstrated Dr. Nitta’s PCP status: (1) recognition by other 
doctors and medical providers in the East Hawaiʻi community as a PCP; (2) 
acceptance and payment by medical insurers as a PCP; and (3) hundreds of 
written and oral testimony by people in support of a finding that he is a 
PCP.   
 
 Amici also argued that DHS’s “formula to determine the sixty -percent-
threshold requirement [was] in complete disregard for actual medical 
practice.”  To determine whether a physician met the threshold, DHS used 
“paid billing codes,” which do not take into account the “percentage of total 
services provided in a managed care envi ronment by that physician.”  The CMS 
interpretation of the Medicaid Enhanced Payment Statute, however, stated that 
physicians could also self -attest t hat, as an alternative, sixty percent of 
all Medicaid services they “provide[] in a managed care environme nt” are PCP 
services.   
 
 Amici noted that, in actual practice, PCPs sometimes bill under their 
provider number for ancillary services (i.e., urine testing, blood work, X -
rays) furnished by other professions under the physician’s supervision.  In 
group pra ctices, physicians sometimes also bill for ancillary services under 
the group provider number.  By including these ancillary services in the 
denominator (i.e., the total services provided by the physician) of its 
formula, according to amici, DHS unfairly s kews the actual ratio of PCP 
services to total services provided by a physician.

    c. Averett 
 While the ICA appeal was pending, the Sixth Circuit issued 
its Averett opinion invalidating the Rule that set forth 
additional e ligibility requirements for the Program.  943 F.3d 
at 319.  In Averett, Tennessee’s Medicaid agency, TennCare, had 
sought to recoup an average of more than $100,000.00 per 
physician from twenty -one physicians practicing in family 
medicine in rural Tennesse e.  Averett, 943 F.3d at 316.  
TennCare alleged that the physicians had not met the sixty 
percent billing requirement of the Rule.8  Id.  In turn, the 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
(continued. . .) 
 According to amici, in Dr. Nitta’s case, a medical billing and coding 
expert had testified that a full audit of his patient records, not just his 
billing records, showed that well over sixty percent of his time and work 
went toward providing PCP services to Medicaid beneficiaries.  Amici 
concluded that DHS’s “use of ‘paid billing codes’ rather than a full audit of 
a physician’s patient records in consideration of services provided in a 
managed care environment  is a manipulation that produces absurd results 
contrary to the intent of the Medicaid Enhanced Payment Statute.”  Thus, 
amici requested that the ICA vacate and remand the DHS and lower court’s 
decisions.   
8  Recall t hat the CMS Final Medicaid Payment Rule defined “primary 
specialty designation” by requiring either board certification in one of the 
listed specialties (or a recognized subspecialty) or the satisfaction of a 
sixty percent billing threshold:  
 
(a) States pa y for services furnished by a physician as 
defined in § 440.50 of this chapter, or under the personal 
supervision of a physician who self -attests to a specialty 
designation of family medicine, general internal medicine 
or pediatric medicine or a subspecial ty recognized by the 
American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS), the American 
Board of Physician Specialties (ABPS) or the American 
Osteopathic Association (AOA).  Such physician then attests 
that he/she:  
 
(1) Is Board Certified with such a specialty or 
subspecialty and/or  
(continued. . .)  ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ** 
 
15 
 physicians challenged the requirement, arguing that it 
contravened the Statute.  Id. 
 After the district court declared the rule invalid and 
TennCare appealed, the Sixth Circuit addressed  
whether, in the [Rule], [CMS] co rrectly interpreted the 
phrase “ primary specialty designation ” as used in [the 
Statute], to mandate not only that the physician have the 
requisite designation of primary specialty, but also that 
the physician either be board -certified in that specialty 
or satisfy the 60 -percent-of-billings requirement.  
 
Averett, 943 F.3d at 317.   The Sixth Circuit opined that the 
term “primary specialty designa tion” in the Statute was 
unambiguous.   Id.  Neither party disputed the meanings of 
“primary specialty” as the physician’s principal area of 
practice or expertise, or the meaning of the word “designate,” 
as in “[t]o indicate or specify; point out.”    Id. (citing The 
American Heritage Dictionary  506 (3d ed. 1992)).  
 The Sixth Circuit discussed CMS’s interpretation of the 
term “primary specialty designation” under a parallel Medicare  
provision.  Averett, 943 F.3d at 317.  Although Congress used 
the same term i n the same context for both the Medicare and 
Medicaid programs, CMS interpreted the term differently f rom the

eligible physicians, the prior month.

 Medicaid and Medicare counterpart rules.  Averett, 943 F.3d at 
318.  For Medicaid, CMS added board certification and sixty 
percent billing thresho ld requirements to the Rule.   Id.  For 
Medicare, however, CMS interpreted the term to simply mean “the 
physician’s own designation, as her primary specialty, of one of 
the specialties recited in that Medicare provision.”  Averett, 
943 F.3d at 317 (citing 4 2 C.F.R. § 414.80(a)(i)(A)).   
 The Sixth Circuit determined that the latter was the proper 
interpretation because, unlike the Rule,9 it did not conflict 
with the language of the Statute.  Averett, 943 F.3d at 318 -19.  
It indicated this interpretation made  “perfect sense, given the 
apparently uniform practice of physician self -designation under 
Medicare and Medicaid.”  Averett, 943 F.3d at 317.  Thus, the 
Sixth Circuit held that the phrase “a physician with a primary 
specialty designation” for purposes of t he Statute meant “a 
physician who has himself designated, as his primary specialty, 
one of the specialties recited in those provisions.”  Averett, 
                                                           
9  The Sixth Circuit also noted that CMS did not offer any actual 
interpretation of the Statute in support of its construction; it offered only 
policy argument s.  Averett, 943 F.3d at 318.  CMS had argued that, because 
Congress did not limit the definition of “primary specialty designation,” CMS 
was required and had authority to do so itself.  Id.  The Sixth Circuit 
disagreed, stating that the “specific limitati ons” were the words themselves, 
and that no one seemed to be confused about what they meant.  Id.  
Additionally, Congress had included a sixty percent billing threshold in its 
Medicare provision but specifically left it out of its Medicaid provision.  
Averett, 943 F.3d at 318 -19. ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ** 
 
17 
  943 F.3d at 319.  The Sixth Circuit invalidated the Rule as 
inconsistent with the Statute.  Id.   
  d. Supplemental briefing 
 On December 23, 2021, the ICA ordered the parties to submit 
supplemental briefing “addressing whether and how Averett 
applied to the issues on appeal, and the relief sought, in light 
of Averett.”  
 On January 4, 2022, Dr. Nitta filed his s upplemental brief, 
arguing that, like the physicians in Averett, he was entitled to 
enhanced payments under the Program.  On January 5, 2022, DHS 
filed its supplemental brief, arguing that Averett invalidated 
the Rule only and not the Statute.  DHS argued the plain 
language of the Statute still required Dr. Nitta to have a 
primary specialty designation of “family medicine, general 
internal medicine, or pediatric medicine.”   
 DHS also argued Averett also defined “primary specialty 
designation” and had discu ssed two sources that would indicate a 
physician’s primary specialty:  the physician’s Medicaid 
application and the National Provider Identifier (“NPI”).  DHS 
argued that both Dr. Nitta’s 1993 Medicaid application and 2006 
NPI form listed his primary speci alty designation as OB/GYN.  
  ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ** 
 
18 
    e. ICA opinion  
 On February 11, 2022, the ICA published an opinion holding 
that (1) the Rule was invalid; and (2) the DHS self -attestation 
form modelled on the Rule was therefore also invalid.  Nitta, 
151 Hawaiʻi at 128-29, 508 P.3d at 1214 -15.  The ICA adopted the 
Sixth Circuit’s analysis in Averett and held the circuit court 
wrongly concluded that Dr. Nitta was ineligible by relying on 
the Rule.   Id.  Based on Averett, the ICA also held that DHS’s 
self-attestation form co nflicted with the Statute because it 
included the Rule’s additional requirements.  Nitta, 151 Hawaiʻi 
at 129, 508 P.3d at 1215.  
 The ICA (1) vacated DHS’s final decision and the circuit 
court’s decision and order ; and (2) remanded the case to the DHS 
Administrative Appeals Office “for further proceedings as may be 
necessary.”   Id.    
 4. Certiorari appl ication  
 On May 23, 2022, DHS filed its application  for writ of 
certiorari , arguing (1) Dr. Nitta was still ineligible for 
enhanced payments based on the Statute; (2) the circuit court’s 
conclusions relied on the Statute; and (3) DHS is required to 
recoup the overpayment because there was never money 
appropriated to pay Dr. Nitta.   ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  **

 III. Standards of Review  
 For judicial review of contested administrative cases, HRS 
§ 91-14(g) (2012) provides:  
(g) Upon review of the record the court may affirm the 
decision of the agency or remand the case with instructions 
for further proceedings; or it may reverse or modify the 
decision and order if the substantial rights of the 
petitioners may have been prejudiced because the 
administrative findings, conclusions, decisio ns, or orders 
are: 
 
(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory 
provisions;  
 
(2) In excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction 
of the agency;  
 
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure;  
 
(4) Affected by other error of law;  
 
(5) Clearly erroneous in v iew of the reliable, 
probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; 
or 
 
(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized by abuse 
of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of 
discretion.  
 
IV. Discussion  
A.  Dr. Nitta is eligible for the Program  under the Statute  
 
 1. DHS’s position  
 
 DHS does not contest the ICA’s adoption of the Averett 
holding invalidating the Rule.  DHS instead argues that the ICA 
should have addressed Dr. Nitta’s eligibility under the Statute, 
and that he was still ineligibl e.  DHS contends that Dr. Nitta 
was ineligible because his “primary specialty designation” was ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ** 
 
20 
 (continued. . .)  OB/GYN, not family medicine, general internal medicine, or 
pediatric medicine.   
 We agree that Dr. Nitta’s eligibility under the Statute 
should be addressed, an d we now do so.  We disagree with DHS, 
however, that Dr. Nitta was not eligible for the Program under 
the Statute.  For the reasons below, he was.  
 2. A physician can have more than one specialty   
 At the outset, it is important to note that the term 
“primary specialty designation” appears in 42 U.S.C., which 
concerns “The Public Health and Welfare,” only twice: in the 
Medicaid Statute at issue here, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(13)(C),  and 
in the parallel Medicare statute discussed in Averett, 42 U.S.C. 
§ 1395l(x) .   
 DHS asserts Dr. Nitta’s 1993 Medicaid application and 2006 
NPI specialty designation control what constitutes his “primary 
specialty designation” for purposes of the Program.  DHS posits 
that because Dr. Nitta had previously designated a “specialty” 
of OB/GYN, he was precluded from later self -designating a 
different “primary specialty” under the Statute.10  Thus, DHS 
assumes that a physician cannot have more than one specialty.   
                                                           
10  The NPI program replaced previous provider identifiers.  See NPI Fact 
Sheet:  For Healthcare P roviders Who Are Individuals, CMS (Jan. 2006), 
https://www.cms.gov/R egulations -and-Guidance/Administrative -
Simplification/NationalProvIdentStand/Downloads/NPIFactSheet012606.pdf   ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ** 
 
21 
  Just as the Rule at issue here could not contravene the 
Statute, however,  NPI designations required pursuant to 
administrative guidance cannot violate the statute s on which 
they are  based. 
 In this regard, the Sixth Circuit discussed the NPI in the 
following introductory passage:  
The Medicare program is funded and administered by the 
federal government; the Medicaid program is funded largely 
by the federal government but administered primarily by the 
states.  In 1996, Congress directed the Secretary of Health 
and Human Services to create a “standard unique health 
identifier” for  each “health care provider” participating 
in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and to “take into 
account” each provider's “specialty classifications.”   42 
U.S.C. § 1320d-2(b).  Accordingly, at the time relevant 
here, the Secretary required Medicare and Medicaid 
providers to complete a “National Provider Identifier” form 
that required providers to designate their “primary 
specialty.”   See Form CMS -10114 (11/08) at 1 –2. Medicare 
providers also completed a form that required them to 
“designate [their] primary specialty[.]”  See CMS-855I 
(02/08) at 8.  Medicaid providers likewise designated their 
primary specialties through “self -attestation” during most 
if not all states’ enrollment proce sses.  See 77 Fed. Reg. 
66,673–75 (Nov. 6, 2012).  
 
Averett, 943 F.3d at 315 (emphasis added).   
 As indicated in Averett, NPI designati ons are based on 
administrative guidance promulgated pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 
1320d-2(b).  This statute is part of 42 U.S.C. Chapter 7 (Social 
Security), Subchapter XI (General Provisions, Peer Review, and 
Administrative Simplification), Part C (Administrat ive 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
(continued. . .) 
[perma.cc/EWL2 -EWK2] (last visited November 1, 2022).   We therefore address 
the effect of Dr. Nitta’s 2006 NPI identifier.  ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ** 
 
22 
  Simplication); in other words, 42 U.S.C. § 1320d et. seq. is 
concerned with “administrative simplification.”11   
 Within this Part C, 42 U.S.C. § 1320d -2 is titled 
“Standards for information transactions and data elements.” 
Subsection (b) provides:  
(b) Unique health identifiers  
 
(1) In general 
 
The Secretary shall adopt standards providing for a 
standard unique health identifier for each individual, 
employer, health plan, and health care  provider for use in 
the health care system .  In carrying out the pr eceding 
sentence for each health plan and health care provider, the 
Secretary shall take into account  multiple uses for 
identifiers and multiple  locations and specialty 
classifications for health care providers . 
 
(2) Use of identifiers  
 
The standards adopt ed under paragraph (1) shall specify the 
purposes for which a unique health identifier may be used.  
 
(Emphasis added .)  Hence, 42 U.S.C. § 1320d -2 created NPIs  
 
                                                           
11  The NPI system wa s actually established for billing and payment 
purposes.  42 U.S.C. § 1395u(r):  
(r) Establishment  of physician  identification  system 
The Secretary shall establish a system which provides for a 
unique identifier for each physician who furnishes services 
for which payment may be made under this subchapter.   Under 
such system, the Secretary may impose appropriate fees on 
such physicians to cover the costs of investigation and 
recertification activities with respect to the issuance of 
the identifiers.  
 
See also National Provider Identifier Standard (NPI), CMS (Dec. 1 , 2021), 
https://www.cms.gov/Regulations -and-Guidance/Administrative -
Simplification/NationalProvIdentStand  [perma.cc/DR7S -V7Q9] (last visited

23 
  for informational and data purposes.12  This statute requires a 
“standard unique health identif ier for each individual  . . . 
health care provider for use in the health care system.”  But, 
pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1320d -2(b)(1), the NPI system clearly 
allows for “multiple  . . . specialty classifications for health 
care providers.”   
 This raises the q uestion of whether an individual physician 
can be a “health care provider” with “multiple specialty 
classifications. ”  In this regard, 42 U.S.C. § 1320d provides 
definitions for all terms under Part C. 42 U.S.C. § 1320d(3) 
then defines “health care provider” as follows:  
(3) Health care provider  
 
The term “ health care provider ” includes a  provider of 
services (as  defined in section 1395x(u)13 of this title), a 
provider of medical or other health servic es 
(as defined in section 1395x(s)  of this title) , and any 
other person furnishing health care services or supplies.  
 
(Emphasis added .)  Thus, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1320d(3), a 
“provider of medica l or other health services (as defined in 
section 1395x(s)” can be a “health care provider” with “multiple 
specialty classifications” under 42 U.S.C. § 1320d -2(b)(1).  The 
                                                           
12  Again, the NPI system was actually created for billing and payment 
purposes.  See supra note 11.  
 
13  “Provider of services” is defined by 42 U.S.C. § 1395x(u) as “ a 
hospital, critical access hospital, rural emergency hospital, skilled nursing 
facility, comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facility, home health 
agency, hospice program”; thus, an individual physician cannot be a “provide r 
of services” under this definition.  
 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ** 
 
24 
  additional question then is whether an individual physician can 
be a “provider of me dical or other health care services” “as 
defined in section 1395x(s).”  
   42 U.S.C. § 1395x(s) provides as follows:  
(s) Medical and other health services  
The term “medical and other health services” means any of the 
following items or services:  
(1) physicians' services ; 
 
. . . . 
 
(2) 
(L) certified nurse -midwife services;  
(M) qualified psychologist services;  
(N) clinical social worker services (as defined in subsection 
(hh)(2))[.]  
 
(Emphasis added .)  42 U.S.C. § 1395x(s) makes clear that an 
individual physic ian (like an individual nurse -midwife, 
psychologist, or clinical social worker), as a provider of 
“medical and other health services,” is a “health care 
provider.”  
 Therefore, under governing federal law, individual 
physicians can have multiple specialty c lassifications under the 
NPI system.  Thus, the fact that Dr. Nitta’s initial NPI 
designation listed a specialty of OB/GYN did not prevent him 
from having another “specialty” that was his “primary specialty” 
during the time period at issue.  
   ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ** 
 
25 
  3. Dr. Nitta self-designated as having one of the   
  requisite specialties as his “primary specialty”  
  
 Accordingly, Dr. Nitta was authorized to have more than one 
medical specialty.  In order to qualify for the Program under 
the Statute, however, Dr. Nitta was re quired to have a “ primary 
specialty designation” of “family medicine, general internal 
medicine, or pediatric medicine” for the relevant time period. 
The issue then is how that designation was to occur.  
 In this respect, we agree with the Sixth Circuit and  the 
ICA that the Rule, which contained requirements inconsistent 
with Statute, was invalid.  We also agree with the Sixth Circuit 
and ICA that “a physician with a primary specialty designation” 
for purposes of the eligibility under the Statute means “a 
physician who has himself designated, as his primary specialty, 
one of the specialties recited in those provisions[,]”  which 
are family, general internal, or pediatric medicine.  
 DHS and the circuit court ruled Dr. Nitta ineligible based 
on invalidated Rul e requirements.  The parties do not actually 
dispute that Dr. Nitta did designate, as his primary specialty, 
either family medicine, general internal medicine, or pediatric 
medicine.   
 As the Rule and self -attestation form have been 
invalidated, the fact that Dr. Nitta did not personally submit 
the on-line application is immaterial.  To the extent a staff ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ** 
 
26 
 member had enrolled Dr. Nitta in the Program based on the 
recommendation of AlohaCare, Dr. Nitta ratified the action of 
his office staff regarding the “s elf-designation” and indicated 
that because he practices in internal medicine “all day,” he was 
self-attesting to being a PCP who works in general internal 
medicine.  Thus, Dr. Nitta did self -designate internal medical 
as his principal area of practice, or  primary specialty, for the 
time period of the Program.  This self -designation was 
consistent with the findings in DHS’s final decision  that HMSA, 
UnitedHealthcare, AlohaCare, and Hilo Medical Center, as well as 
Hilo community medical professionals in gene ral, recognized Dr. 
Nitta as a PCP.    
 Accordingly, we hold that Dr. Nitta was eligible for 
enhanced payments under the Statute.   
 Our holding is consistent with the purposes of the Program.  
Congress clearly intended the enhanced payments as incentives 
for the provision of primary care services, regardless of a 
physician’s other practice areas.  We agree with amici that  
[t]he legislative history accompanying the [Statute] 
indicates that the enhanced payments were meant to address 
Medicaid reimbursement r ates for primary care services that 
were substantially lower than the Medicare rates for the 
same services.  [See H.R. Rep. No. 111 -299, pt. 1, at 617 -
19 (2009).]  Congress stated that the enhancements were 
necessary because:  
 
These low Medicaid payment ra tes do not provide 
adequate incentives for physicians to participate in 
Medicaid, limiting access to physicians’ services by 
Medicaid beneficiaries.  In addition, low Medicaid ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ** 
 
27 
 payment rates discourage young physicians and other 
health professionals from en tering careers in primary 
care, undermining efforts to address the shortage of 
primary care practitioners in many areas of the 
country.  [ Id.] 
 
The legislative history further indicates that Congress 
intended the enhanced payments to apply broadly to “prim ary 
care services furnished by any participating physician or 
health professional, not just a primary care physician or 
professional [.]”  [Id. at 618 (emphasis added).]  
 
 For all of these reasons, Dr. Nitta was eligible for 
enhanced payments pursuant to th e Statute.  
B. DHS’s other points on certiorari lack merit  
 1. The circuit court relied solely on the invalid Rule  
  when it deemed Dr. Nitta ineligible for the Program  
 
 DHS also asserts on certiorari that the circuit court did 
not solely rely on the Rul e, but also relied on the Statute when 
it deemed Dr. Nitta ineligible for the Program.  
 Our holding above resolves this issue.  If the circuit 
court had determined Dr. Nitta ineligible based on the Statute, 
it would have been wrong.  But the record reflec ts the circuit 
court (and DHS) relied solely on the invalidated Rule in deeming 
Dr. Nitta ineligible and not did not rely on the Statute.  
 2. DHS waived its appropriation argument  
 Finally, we reject DHS’s third issue on certiorari, that 
DHS is required t o recoup the overpayment because there was 
never money appropriated to pay Dr. Nitta.  This is a new 
argument never raised below and is therefore waived.  See Ass’n 
of Apt. Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea Resort Co., 100 Hawaiʻi ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ** 
 
28 
 97, 107, 58 P.3d 608, 618 (2002) (“Legal issues  not raised in 
the trial court are ordinarily  deemed waived on appeal.”)  
V. Conclusion  
 Having determined Dr. Nitta eligible for enhanced payments 
under the St atute, we vacate the ICA’s March 23, 2022 judgment 
on appeal to the extent it remanded the case “to the DHS 
Administrative Appeals Office for further proceedings as may be 
necessary.”  The ICA’s judgment on appeal is otherwise affirmed.
