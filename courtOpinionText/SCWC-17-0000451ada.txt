 from a published opinion of the Intermediate Court of Appeals 
(“ICA”).1  
 The family court ent ered a divorce decree on July 5, 2011, 
after a November 2009 divorce trial between petitioner  Nicoleta 
Jacoby (“Nicoleta”) and respondent  Bennett Jacoby (“Bennett”) .2  
In relevant part, the family court awarded Nicoleta 
indeterminate spousal support of $4, 000 per month.   The family 
court calculated the spousal support award partly based on a 
finding that Bennett’s total gross monthly income was $29,402 , 
which included  $9,064 in investment income.  The family court 
had, however, also awarded half of the asse ts generating the 
subject investment income to Nicoleta as part of the property 
division.   
 In a 201 4 published opinion, t he ICA affirmed in part and 
vacated in part the July 5, 2011 divorce decree and remanded 
several issues , which included the issue of spousal support,  to 
the family court for further proceedings.  Jacoby v. Jacoby  
(Jacoby I ), 134 Hawaiʻi 431, 341 P.3d 1231 (App. 2014) , as 
corrected  (Mar. 24, 2015) .3  In relevant part, the ICA concluded 
                                                           
1  The Honorable Aley K. Auna, Jr., presided over this remanded case.  
Judge Auna also presided over the 20 09 divorce proceedings.

joined in by Chief Judge Craig H. Nakamura and then Associate Judge Lisa M. 
Ginoza.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 that the family court erroneously included the entire investment 
income in Bennett’s income instead of allocating half to 
Nicoleta because the family cou rt had awarded half of the assets 
generating the income to Nicoleta.   
 On remand, the family court recalculated the income of the 
parties; Nicoleta’s monthly income  was recalculated as $4,532, 
half of $9,064, and Bennett’s  monthly income was recalculated as 
$24,870.  The family court also reaffirmed Nicoleta’s reasonable 
monthly expenses as $6,237.  The family court concluded , 
however, that  “it would be just and equitable to continue the 
award of permanent spousal support of $4,000 per month.”  
Nicoleta’s resulting total monthly income from the investment 
income and spousal support was $8,532, exceeding her $6,2 37 
monthly reasonable  expenses.   
Bennett appealed, arguing in relevant part that the family 
court abused its discretion and erred as a matter of la w in 
awarding spousal support to Nicoleta that exceeded  her $6,237 
monthly reasonable expenses .  
In its April 20, 2021 summary disposition order (“SDO”), 
the ICA ruled in favor of Bennett.   See Jacoby v. Jacoby  (Jacoby 
II), Nos. CAAP -17-0000451 and CAAP -19-0000664, 2021 WL 1554197 
(App. Apr. 20, 2021) (SDO).  The ICA did so, however, on the 
basis that in Jacoby I , it had remanded for the family court to 
redetermine spousal support in light of the corrected income *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
4 
 assumptions for investment income.  The ICA ruled the family 
court therefore erred by engaging in a new just and equitable 
determination on remand, as it was not a part of the remand 
order in Jacoby I .   
On certiorari, Nicoleta argues the ICA erred by ruling the 
family court  was precluded on remand from engaging in a new just 
and equitable determination for spousal support . 
We hold the ICA erred by setting aside the amended spousal 
support award order on the basis that the family court was 
prohibited from doing so on remand  because Hawaiʻi Revised 
Statutes (“HRS”)  § 580-47(a) (2006 & Supp. 2011) provides family 
courts with continuing jurisdiction to address issues of spousal 
support.  We also hold, however, that the family court erred, on 
remand, by maintaining spousal support at $4,000 a month because 
it awarded more spousal support than it determined was required 
to satisfy Nicoleta’s demonstrated needs.   We also hold, 
however, that  the family court  abused its discretion by not 
holding a hearing on remand to determine whether the spousal 
support amou nt should have been a mended because Ni coleta showed 
good cause for a redetermination.  
Hence, we vacate  in part and affirm in part  the ICA’s May 
24, 2021 judgment on appeal , and we remand this case to the 
family court for further proceedings consistent with  this 
opinion.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 II. Background4  
A. Factual background  
 Nicoleta was born in Romania in 1969.  She suffered various 
medical ailments in her youth.   In November 1990, Nicoleta moved 
to the United States.  Nicoleta met Bennett, a periodontist, in 
California  in May 1992 and they married on June 12, 1993 .  
Nicoleta worked at Bennett’s  periodontal  clinic for some time  
without pay .  Their son was born in June 1995 and their daughter 
in January 1997.   
 Nicoleta continued to suffer from numerous medical ailments 
throughout her life, which impacted her employability.  She was 
diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (“MS”) in late 1997.   The 
Jacobys moved to Hawaiʻi in May 1998 and they purchased a house 
in August 1998.   Nicoleta continued to have MS flare -ups, for 
which she consulted specialists in Hawaiʻi and California.   By 
the time of trial, she had also developed optic neuritis, brain 
hemorrhaging , carpal tunn el syndrome, and left shoulder 
problems.     
 Thus, for the majority of the marriage, Bennet t provided 
sole financial support for the family.   His income included 
funds from a periodontal endoscope he developed and had patented 
in 1993.   Bennett developed m yofascial pain dysfunction syndrome

 after a 1996 surfing accident  and began receiving disability 
benefits.   He was able, however, to continue work ing part-time 
as a periodontist.     
B. Procedural background  
 1. Pre-Jacoby I  proceedings  
 On December 9, 2008 , Nicoleta filed for divorce.  The 
divorce trial was held on November 12, 13, 19, and 27, 2009.    
 On April 14, 2011, the family court filed its findings of 
fact and conclusions of law  (“divorce trial order”) .  In 
relevant part, the family court found (1)  Nicoleta suffered 
numerous medical ailments; (2) Nicoleta was “medically unable to 
pursue any gainful employment as a result of the multiple and 
serious chronic medical conditions from which she has suffered 
since the age of 16 years” ; (3) Nicoleta’s $3,3 27 household and 
transportation expenses, excluding her automobile loan payments, 
and her $2,910 personal monthly expenses, including medical and 
dental, for a total of $6,237 in monthly expenses, were 
reasonable; (4)  Bennett’s total gross monthly income w as 
$29,402, which included: (a)  $16,343 per month from partial, tax 
free disability payments; ( b) $9,064 per month from the 
investment income; ( c) $1,267 per month from royalty income;  and 
(d) $2,728 per month from his part -time periodontist work; ( 5) 
Bennett, for the majority  of the sixteen -year marriage, was the 
sole financial support for the family and had the greater *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
7 
 earning capacity; and ( 6) the parties had a high standard of 
living.  
 The family court concluded “it would be just and equitable 
to award  [Nicoleta] permanent spousal support of $4,000 per 
month” that would “terminate upon the death of either party or 
upon the remarriage or cohabitation of [Nicoleta].”  The family 
court calculated the spousal support award based, inter alia, on 
its finding that Bennett’s total gross monthly income before 
deductions for support awards and medical premiums was $29,402, 
which included the entire investment income.5   
 On July 5, 2011, the family court filed its Decree Granting 
Absolute Divorce and Awarding Chil d Custody  (“divorce decree”) , 
which dissolved the parties’ marriage and incorporated the 
divorce trial order .  On August 3, 2011, Bennett appealed the 
divorce trial order and divorce decree to the ICA, arguing in 
relevant part that the family court erred b y awarding Nicoleta 
$4,000 monthly spousal support.  On August 17, 2011, Nicoleta 
cross-appealed from the divorce decree.   
                                                           
5  Regarding property division, the family court prepared an allocation 
chart of the $3,564,440 marital estate.  Of this amount, the assets prod ucing 
the $9,064 monthly investment income had a total value of $2,691,452.  The 
family court awarded the parties half each, or $1,345,726 each.  Further, 
although based on marital partnership principles, Bennett would have been 
awarded $2,027,403, the fam ily court awarded marital assets of $1,438,726 to 
him.  Likewise, although Nicoleta would have received $1,537,037, the family 
court allocated $2,125,714 to her.  Although Bennett would then be entitled 
to a $588,677 equalization payment from Nicoleta, the  family court determined 
there were sufficient “valid and relevant considerations” to deviate from 
marital partnership principles and waived Nicoleta’s equalization payment.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

  2. Jacoby I  
 In a 2014 published opinion, the ICA ruled in relevant part 
that the family court  did not err by awarding Nicoleta per manent 
spousal support , and that  Bennett did not meet his burden on 
appeal to demonstrate the family court erred in determining the 
amount of Nicoleta’s reasonable monthly expenses.  Jacoby I , 134 
Hawaiʻi at 446, 341 P.3d at 1246.   The ICA noted the family court 
had found (1) Nicoleta suffered from numerous ailments since the 
age of sixteen, citing to the family court’s findings in its 
divorce trial order; (2) as a result of these ailments, Nicoleta 
was “medically unable to pursue any gainful employment”; and (3) 
Bennett had been the sole financial support for the family for 
the majority of th e parties’  sixteen-year marriage .  Id. 
 The ICA concluded:  
However, as Bennett argues, the Family Court included 
the entire amount of the Investment Income ($9,064) as part 
of Bennett ’s income and none of it as part of Nicoleta ’s 
income, even though the Family Court awarded 50% of the 
Accounts, the underlying assets generating this Investment 
Income, to Nicoleta.  The Family Court clearly erred in 
this regard and, therefore, utilized erroneous income 
assumptions for both parties when it determined that 
Nicoleta was entitled to $4,000 per month in spousal 
support.  
 
. . . . 
 
The Family Court’s findings show that it caref ully 
considered all of the factors provided in HRS § 580 –47(a) 
when it determined that Nicoleta was entitled to spousal 
support.  However, the Family Court abused its discretion 
in ordering Bennett to pay $4,000 per month in spousal 
support to Nicoleta bas ed on the erroneous allocation of 
the Investment Income generated by the parties’ Accounts, 
which were divided equally between them.  
 
Id. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 The ICA remanded to the family court for further 
proceedings consistent with its opinion.  134 Hawaiʻi at 458, 341 
P.3d at 1258.  No certiorari application was filed.  
 3. Family court proceedings on remand  
 On May 14, 2015, Nicoleta filed a memorandum to request an 
evidentiary hearing on, inter alia, the spousal support issue.  
She asserted that the spousal support  issue could not be 
resolved “by just some  recalculations  based on the ICA’s 
assumptions .”  She argued that circumstances had changed since 
the initial calculation of spousal support.  Specifically, 
Nicoleta contended that  since the July 5, 2011 divorce decree, 
she had not received the investment income presumed to be 
allocated to her, and that Bennett had been receiving the 
investment income, which was not a circumstance contemplated by 
the family court or ICA.   Nicoleta contended that although the 
ICA assumed th e underlying assets generating the investment 
income were divided equally, they were not ; thus, an evidentiary 
hearing was necessary  to determine who received what share of 
the investment income to accurately determine how much, if any, 
of a recalculation was necessary.  Nicoleta also argued it would 
be manifestly unjust to attribute income to her that she never 
received, and to reduce the spousal support obligation by not 
attributing the income to Bennett.    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
10 
  In response, Bennett argued Jacoby I  did not i nstruct or 
suggest the family court should hold an evidentiary hearing to 
determine what investment income the parties actually received 
during the years since the divorce decree ; the family court’s 
duty on remand, Bennett contended, was simply to correct its 
error by issuing an amended divorce decree  “as it would have 
read if the error had not been made .”  Bennett contended 
Nicoleta’s argument that he received her portion of the 
investment income  was “simply not a proper consideration even if 
it were true. ”  Bennett argued that Nicoleta never brought a 
motion to enforce or otherwise objected that she did not receive 
half of the assets underlying the investment income.  According 
to Bennett, if Nicoleta was unable to generate the same level of 
investment inc ome, her remedy would have been a motion to modify 
the support orders during the pendency of the appeal, which was 
an issue separate from the family court’s obligation to correct 
its errors in the divorce decree.  Bennett asserted that Jacoby 
I ruled on th e basis of the record only and its instructions on 
remand were based on the record; opening the record to consider 
new evidence would essentially amount to a new trial and would 
invite a possible new, costly, and time -consuming appeal.   
 In a June 29, 201 5 order, the family court stated it would 
not conduct an evidentiary hearing but ordered the parties to *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
11 
 file, inter alia, arguments based upon the evidence presented at 
trial and Jacoby I .   
 In her July 27, 2015 memorandum, Nicoleta argued that the 
investment income should also have been divided equally , as the 
ICA noted the family court equally allocated the assets 
generating the investment income .  To be consistent with Jacoby 
I, Nicoleta contended , the parties’ monthly income should 
reflect the allocati on of the investment income.   
 Nicoleta stated that, as noted in Jacoby I , the $4,000 
monthly spousal support was based only in part on Bennett’s 
$29,402 monthly income, and that once the family court allocated 
half of the investment income to each party,  it should still 
perform a n HRS § 580 -47(a) analysis.  Nicoleta maintained that, 
in addition to the reasons the family court considered in 
awarding spousal support, given her numerous health problems, 
her expenses would  “undoubtedly”  increase as her medica l 
conditions worsened over time.  Thus, Nicoleta asserted that 
even after considering the HRS § 580 -47(a) factors and the 
allocation of the investment income to her, the family court 
could not reasonably find that Nicoleta was able to meet her 
basic needs and maintain her standard of living without spousal 
support.   
 Nicoleta argued that reallocation of the investment income 
did not automatically require a downward modification of the  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
12 
 spousal support award.  She maintained her expenses would 
inevitably inc rease and even if the $4,000 spousal support was 
awarded to her, there was still a large income disparity between 
the parties.  Nicoleta asserted that, accordingly, the family 
court should reconsider the HRS § 580 -47(a) factors and reaffirm 
the $4,000 mont hly spousal support award.  Doing so would also 
prevent manifest injustice , Nicoleta stated,  because Bennett’s 
counsel had suggested he m ight attempt to recoup “overpayment” 
of spousal support in a later motion.   
 In response, Bennett maintained that the mandate in Jacoby 
I directed the family court to revise its findings of fact and 
conclusions of law, which would now require Nicoleta to 
reimburse him for overpayment of the spousal support .  Bennett 
also maintained  that the family court could not consider  “new 
evidence.”    
 On February 8, 2016, the family court filed its Order on 
Issues on Remand (“remand order”).  The family court found and 
concluded as to spousal support  as follows : 
1. Wife’s household, transportation, and personal monthly 
expenses tota l $6,237 (Decree, Findings of Fact 108 and 
109; hereinafter “FOF”).  
2. Wife’s income is based upon spousal support and $290 
payment made by Husband for her medical insurance premiums 
(FOF 122).  
3. Accrued interest of bonds and Certificates of Deposit is 
$9,064 per month (FOF 114).  
4. Pursuant to the Decree, the investment accounts that 
generated the $9,06 [4] monthly income were divided equally.  
Accordingly, each party is to receive $4,532 per month 
($9,064 ÷ 2) in income generated from these investment 
accounts.  The Court did not take this into account when it 
issued its Decree.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
13 
 5. Child support is not considered income for the purposes 
of calculating spousal support.  
6. Husband was ordered to pay $290 per month towards Wife’s 
medical insurance premium (F OF 122).  
7. Husband’s total monthly income, excluding the deduction 
of Wife’s medical insurance premium, is recalculated to 
$24,870 ($29,402 - $4,532; see FOF 117).  
8. Wife’s total monthly income, excluding the medical 
insurance premium, is recalculated to  $4,532. 
9. The parties continue to have a large disparity in 
income; a little over $20,300 difference.  
10. All FOFs made in the Decree inconsistent [sic] with the 
findings herein continue to be relevant to the Court’s 
decision regarding spousal support.  
11. Under the circumstances of this case, it would be just 
and equitable to continue the award of permanent spousal 
support of $4,000 per month.  
 
 On May 2, 2017, the family court filed its Amended Decree 
Granting Absolute Divorce and Awarding Child Custody  (“amended 
divorce decree ”), which incorporated the remand order.   
 On June 1, 2017, Bennett appealed from the remand order and 
amended divorce decree, in itiating  CAAP-17-0000451.   
 On March 20, 2019, Nicoleta filed a motion to enforce, in 
relevant part,  the divorce decree and amended divorce decree ; to 
establish the manner of spousal support payments ; and for an 
order directing Bennett to pay her attorney fees and costs.   On 
August 28, 2019, the family court6 entered its Order and Judgment 
in Favor of Pl aintiff Nicoleta Jacoby and Against Defendant 
Bennett Jacoby for Attorney’s Fees and Costs  (“attorney fees 
order”).  On September 20, 2019, the family court entered its 
Order Following Hearing on Plaintiff’s March 20, 2019 Motion to 
Enforce July 5, 2011 De cree and May 2, 2017 Amended Decree, for

14 
 Order Establishing Manner of Alimony Payments to Plaintiff, and 
for Order Directing Defendant to Pay Plaintiff’s Attorney’s Fees 
and Costs  (“enforcement order”) .   
 On September 27, 2019, Bennett appealed from the  August 28, 
2019 attorney fees order and the  September 20, 2019 enforcement 
order, initiating  CAAP-19-0000664.   
 4. ICA proceedings  
 The ICA consolidated CAAP -17-0000451 and CAAP -19-0000664 
under CAAP -17-0000451.7   
On appeal , Bennett argued  in relevant par t that the family 
court abused its discretion and erred as a matter of law in 
awarding spousal support to Nicoleta in an amount that grossly 
exceeded the family court’s calculation of her reasonable needs 
in its remand order.8  He argued that if Nicoleta’s  “reasonable 
needs were met with a $4,000 award of monthly spousal support 
prior to considering and accounting for that $4,532 in dividend 
                                                           
7  In CAAP-19-0000664, Bennett argued the family court (1) abused its 
discretion by awarding Nicoleta attorney fees without inquir ing into the 
parties’ current economic condition; (2) abused its discretion in entering 
certain FOFs relating to Nicoleta’s medical issues when no evidence was 
presented during the motion to enforce hearing; (3) erred by awarding 
attorney fees to Nicoleta because “this was not an enforcement action on 
which [Nicoleta] prevailed;” and (4) abused its discretion by awarding 
attorney fees to Nicoleta because the award w as excessive, not fair and 
reasonable, and made without an evidentiary hearing.   These issues are not 
relevant on certiorari and therefore not further discussed.  
 
8  Bennett also argued the family court  erred as a matter of law in (1) 
allocating the values  of the parties’ respective bank and checking and 
savings accounts to them twice; and (2) failing to recalculate post -judgment 
interest based on the corrected allocation of the values of the parties’ 
accounts.  These issues are not relevant on certiorari a nd therefore not 
further discussed.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
15 
 and interest income, she did not continue to need $4,000 per 
month to meet her reasonable needs, once that $4,532 in income 
was properly accounted for.”  Nicoleta responded  that the family 
court properly continued the $4,000 monthly spousal support 
given her needs, health conditions, Bennett’s ability to pay, 
and the significant disparity in the parties’ incomes.   
 The ICA concluded Bennett’s argument had merit.  Jacoby II, 
SDO at 3 .  The ICA stated that the family court,  on remand,  
although  having applied the corrected income assumptions, still 
arrived at the same $4,000 monthly spousal support level  after 
engaging in a  new just and equitable determination, which the 
ICA held was not part of the orders on remand.  Jacoby II , SDO 
at 3-4.  The ICA vacated the spousal support award and remanded 
to the family court to recalculate the award using the corrected 
investment inco me figure of $4,532 for each party, taking into 
account Nicoleta’s $6,237 reasonable monthly expenses that w ere 
affirmed in Jacoby I .9  Jacoby II , SDO at 3, 13. 
 The ICA filed its judgment on appeal on May 24, 2021.10 
                                                           
9  See Jacoby II , SDO at 6 -13, for the ICA’s other rulings not relevant on 
certiorari . 
 
10  The judgment on appeal was signed by Associate Judge Karen T. Nakasone.  
Associate Judge Leonard, who authored Jacoby I , was on t he panel  for Jacoby 
II, along with now Chief Judge Ginoza, who was also on Jacoby I .    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
16 
  5. Supreme court proceedings  
 On certiorari, Nicoleta  argues the ICA erred because Jacoby 
I did not prohibit the family court, on remand, from again 
considering the HRS § 580 -47(a) factors.  Nicoleta asserts 
Jacoby II  “contradicts the language, spirit, and intent of HRS § 
580-47 in all respec ts.”  Nicoleta points out that there is no 
mathematical formula or model to use in calculating spousal 
support; the application of simple math does not ensure a 
spouse’s needs will be met, which is why the family court is 
required to consider the HRS § 580 -47(a) factors .  As such, 
Nicoleta asserts that even if the family court factored in the 
investment income, the family court could still have concluded 
that she was entitled to $4,000 monthly spousal support based on 
its consideration of the HRS § 580 -47(a) factors.   
 Nicoleta argues that by concluding the family court erred 
by engaging in a new just and equitable determination and by 
requiring the family court to apply simple math to the 
determination of spousal support, Jacoby II  undermined the 
family co urt’s discretion to determine spousal support.  
Nicoleta asserts  that if Jacoby II  is left to stand, it  would 
negatively impact her ability to support herself, as Jacoby II  
appeared to dictate that the spousal support amount should have 
been $1,705 per mon th (Nicoleta’s reasonable monthly expenses of 
$6,237 – investment income of $4,532  = $1,705 ).  Nicoleta *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
17 
 asserts that Bennett could therefore demand that she reimburse 
him the amount he paid her over $1,705 each month  for the past 
ten years, which , if order ed by the family court, would be 
financially disastrous for her.    
III. Standards of review  
A. Family court decisions  
 
Generally, the family court possesses wide discretion 
in making its decisions and those decisions will not be set 
aside unless there is a manifest abuse of discretion.  
Thus, we will not disturb the family court's decision on 
appeal unless the family court disregarded rules or 
principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment 
of a party litigant and its decision clearly exceeded t he 
bounds of reason.

It is well established that a family court abuses its 
discretion where “(1) the family court disregarded rules or 
principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment 
of a party litigant; (2) the family court failed to 
exercise its equitable discretion; or (3) the family 
court's decision clearly exceeds the bounds of reason.”

B. Family court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law  
 
This courts reviews the family court’s findings of f act 
under the “clearly erroneous” standard.  W.N. v. S.M. , 143 
Hawaiʻi 128, 133, 424 P.3d 483, 488 (2018) (citation omitted).  
A [finding of fact]  is clearly erroneous when (1) the 
record lacks substantial evidence to support the finding, 
or (2) despite substantial evidence in support of the 
finding, the appellate court is  nonetheless left with a 
definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.  
“Substantial evidence” is credible evidence which is of 
sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person 
of reasonable caution to support a conclusion.

IV. Discussion  
A. The ICA erred by ruling Jacoby I  prohibited the family 
court from reconsidering the HRS § 580 -47(a) factors on 
remand to determine a just and equitable spousal support 
amount 
  
 HRS § 580 -47(a) provides : 
(a) Upon granting a divorce, or thereafter if , in 
addition to the powers granted in subsections (c) and (d), 
jurisdiction of those matters is reserved under the decree  
by agreement of both parties or by order of court after 
finding that good cause exists, the court may make any 
further orders as shall appear just and equitable  . . . (2) 
compelling either party to provide for the support and 
maintenance of the other part y . . . .  In making these 
further orders, the court shall take into consideration: 
the respective merits of the parties, the relative 
abilities of the parties, the condition in which each party 
will be left by the divorce, the burdens imposed upon 
either party for the benefit of the children of the 
parties, the concealment of or failure to disclose income 
or an asset, or violation of a restraining order issued 
under section 580 -10(a) or (b), if any, by either party, 
and all other circumstances of the case.   . . . . 
 
In addition to any other relevant factors considered, 
the court, in ordering spousal support and maintenance, 
shall consider the following factors : 
 
(1) Financial resources of the parties;  
(2) Ability of the party seeking support and 
maintenance  to meet his or her needs independently;  
(3) Duration of the marriage;  
(4) Standard of living established during the 
marriage;  
(5) Age of the parties;  
(6) Physical and emotional condition of the parties;  
(7) Usual occupation of the parties during the 
marriage; 
(8) Vocational skills and employability of the party 
seeking support and maintenance;  
(9) Needs of the parties;  
(10) Custodial and child support responsibilities;  
(11) Ability of the party from whom support and 
maintenance is sought to meet his or her  own needs *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
19 
 while meeting the needs of the party seeking support 
and maintenance;  
(12) Other factors which measure the financial 
condition in which the parties will be left as the 
result of the action under which the determination of 
maintenance is made; an d 
(13) Probable duration of the need of the party 
seeking support and maintenance.  
 
The court may order support and maintenance to a 
party for an indefinite period or until further order of 
the court ; provided that in the event the court determines 
that support and maintenance shall be ordered for a 
specific duration wholly or partly based on competent 
evidence as to the amount of time which will be required 
for the party seeking support and maintenance to secure 
adequate training, education, skills, or oth er 
qualifications necessary to qualify for appropriate 
employment, whether intended to qualify the party for a new 
occupation, update or expand existing qualification, or 
otherwise enable or enhance the employability of the party, 
the court shall order sup port and maintenance for a period 
sufficient to allow completion of the training, education, 
skills, or other activity, and shall allow, in addition, 
sufficient time for the party to secure appropriate 
employment.  
 
(Emphases added.)  
Thus, the family court has wide discretion when making its 
decision regarding spousal support.  See Brutsch, 139 Hawaiʻi at 
381, 390 P.3d at 1268.   “When deciding in a divorce case whether 
one party must pay periodic support to the other, for how long, 
and how much, the family c ourt must consider all of the factors 
enumerated in HRS § 580 -47(a).”  Hamilton v. Hamilton , 138 
Hawaiʻi 185, 209, 378 P.3d 901, 925 (2016).   This discretion, 
moreover , continues after the initial determination of spousal 
support.  HRS § 580 -47(a) specific ally provides that “ [t]he 
court may order support and maintenance to a party for an 
indefinite period or until further order of the court  . . . .”  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
20 
 (Emphasis added.)   Thus, family courts have continuing 
jurisdiction to address spousal support.  
Thus, we agree with Nicoleta that the ICA erred by ruling 
the family court, on remand, could not exercise  its discretion 
and issue a new just and equitable order for spousal support.  
We also agree with Nicoleta that, in any event, Jacoby I  did not 
prohibit the family  court, on remand, from again considering the 
HRS § 580 -47(a) factors to maintain the $4,000 monthly spousal 
support award.    
 “The scope of remand is determined not by formula, but by 
inference from the opinion as a whole.”  In re Haw. Elec. Light 
Co., 149 Hawaiʻi 239, 241, 487 P.3d 708, 710 (2021)  (cleaned up) ; 
see also  Chun v. Bd. of Trs. of Emps.’ Ret. Sys. , 106 Hawaiʻi 
416, 439, 106 P.3d 339, 362 (2005) (stating “(1) that it is the 
duty of the trial court, on remand, to comply strictly with the 
mandate of the  appellate court according to its true intent and 
meaning, as determined by the directions given by the reviewing 
court, and (2) that when acting under an appellate court’s 
mandate, an inferior court cannot vary it, or examine it for any 
other purpose than  execution; or give any other or further 
relief; or intermeddle with it, further than to settle so much 
as has been remanded.” (cleaned up)).  
 With respect to the remand order, in Jacoby I , the ICA 
ruled: *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
21 
 However, as Bennett argues, the Family Court inclu ded 
the entire amount of the Investment Income ($9,064) as part 
of Bennett’s income and none of it as part of Nicoleta’s 
income, even though the Family Court awarded 50% of the 
Accounts, the underlying assets generating this Investment 
Income, to Nicoleta.   The Family Court clearly erred in 
this regard and, therefore, utilized erroneous income 
assumptions for both parties when it determined that 
Nicoleta was entitled to $4,000 per month in spousal 
support.  
 
. . . . 
 
The Family Court’s findings show that it carefully 
considered all of the factors provided in HRS § 580 -47(a) 
when it determined that Nicoleta was entitled to spousal 
support.  However, the Family Court abused its discretion 
in ordering Bennett to pay $4,000 per month in spousal 
support to Nicolet a based on the erroneous allocation of 
the Investment Income generated by the parties’ Accounts, 
which were divided equally between them.  
 
134 Hawaiʻi at 446, 341 P.3d at 1246.  The ICA also then 
concluded:  
The Family Court clearly erred in FOF 114 by attributing 
the total $9,064 Investment Income to Bennett when it had 
awarded Nicoleta one -half of the underlying income -
generating assets.  The Family Court should have attributed 
to Nicoleta the monthly income generated by her one -half 
share of these assets when determining her monthly income 
in FOF 124, and decreased Bennett’s monthly income in FOF 
125 accordingly.  
 
134 Hawaiʻi at 447, 341 P.3d at 1247 .  The ICA affirmed in part 
and vacated in part the divorce decree, and indicated it was 
remanding to the family court “for further proceeding consistent 
with this Opinion.”  134 Hawaiʻi at 458, 341 P.3d at 1258.   
 As argued by Nicoleta, Jacoby II  appears to indicate that 
the spousal support under the 2011 divorce d ecree should have 
been $1,705 per month (Nicoleta’s reasonable monthly expenses  of 
$6,237 – investment income of $4,532 = $1,705).  If the ICA  in 
Jacoby I  had intended to have the family court s o adjust the *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
22 
 spousal support amount without further consideration of the 
factors set forth in HRS § 580 -47(a), presumably it would have 
said so explicitly .11  But such a remand order would have been 
erroneous because, as noted, a family court has continuing  
discretion under HRS § 580 -47(a) to address and adjust the 
amount of spousal support.  Thus, the family court’s discretion  
continued.     
 The ICA in Jacoby II  set aside the amended spousal support 
order on the sole basis that the family court was prohibit ed 
from doing so based on the remand.  As the family court had 
continuing jurisdiction to address spousal support  in any event , 
the ICA erred.   
B. The family court abused its discretion by maintaining the 
 $4,000 monthly spousal support award in light of the $4,532 
 investment income allocation to Nicoleta because, added 
 together, Nicoleta’s monthly income  exceeded Nicoleta’s  
 $6,237 monthly reasonable expenses  
 
 Thus, the ICA erred in setting aside the spousal support 
order based on its erroneous conclus ion of law that  the Jacoby I  
remand order prohibited a reconsideration.  Bennett had not even 
argued such a basis for setting aside the spousal support 
amount.  Instead, Bennett had only argued that the family court 
                                                           
11  The ICA could have done the simple math of adjusting the spousal 
support to $1,705 .  HRS § 580 -47(a) still provided the family court with 
discretion to amend  the spousal support award based on  a material change in a 
spouse’s physical or financial circumstances or  if good cause indicate d it 
was just and equitable to do so.  In this case, for example, more than six 
years had passed from the November 2009 divorce trial  to the February 2016 
ruling on remand.  In her  July 27, 2015  memorandum on remand, Nicoleta had 
pointed out circumstances that differed from 2009.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
23 
 abused its discretion and erred as a mat ter of law in awarding 
spousal support in an amount that grossly exceeded the family 
court’s calculation of Nicoleta’s  reasonable needs.  
 Nicoleta notes that under Hawaiʻi law, there is no 
mathematical formula or model to use in calculating spousal 
support.  Nicoleta asserts that even after the family court 
allocated the $4,532 investment income to her,  the family court  
could have maintained  the same $4,000 monthly spousal support 
based on its reconsideration of the HRS § 580 -47(a) factors.   
Nicoleta points  out that if the family court were to adjust the 
monthly spousal support to $1,705, Bennett could demand that she 
reimburse him the amount he paid her over and above $1,705 a 
month for the last ten years.   
 Although the family court did not err by engagin g in a new 
just and equitable determination on remand, under the 
circumstances, the family court abused its discretion by 
arriving at the same $4,000 monthly spousal support award  
without providing sufficient justification .  We have recognized 
that a family court can abuse its discretion if it orders more 
spousal support than is required to satisfy the spouse’s 
demonstrated needs.  See Gordon v. Gordon , 135 Hawaiʻi 340, 356, 
350 P.3d 1008, 1024 (2015) (“Even if Ira is able to pay the 
additional amount of alimony, Susan is not entitled to more 
spousal support than is required to satisfy her demonstrated *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
24 
 needs.”).  So has the ICA.  See Cassiday v. Cassiday , 6 Haw. 
App. 207, 215, 716 P.2d 1145, 1151 (1985), aff’d in part, rev’d 
in part on other grounds , 68 Haw. 383, 716 P.2d 1133 (1986) (“If 
there is no need for spousal support, then there is no 
obligation to pay.  Here, since Wife admits that $3,500 per 
month is suff icient to meet her need, she is not entitled to 
more than that even if Husband is able to pay more.”).  
Thus, Bennett’s assertion on appeal, that the maintenance 
of the $4,000 monthly spousal support was an abuse of discretion 
as it exceeded Nicoleta’s demo nstrated needs, may have merit.  
On remand, the family court maintained the $4,000 monthly 
spousal support award , despite finding that Nicoleta ’s monthly 
reasonable expenses were still $6,2 37.  Although the court cited 
the parties ’ “large disparity in inco me[,] a little over $20,300 
difference ,” in its findings of fact, that factor standing alone 
was insufficient to support its holding.   Additional findings 
were necessary to demonstrate that the judge had appropriately  
considered  the HRS § 580 -47(a) factors  in deciding the amount to 
award in spousal support.   Thus, based on the record, the family 
court abused its discretion by awarding more money than 
Nicoleta’s demonstrated needs required.    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
25 
 C. The family court abused its discretion by not holding a 
hearing on remand to determine whether the spousal support 
amount should have been adjusted   
 
 The family court did have  discretion to order an amended 
spousal support award on remand.  However, the family court 
failed to make a finding of any increased spousal support needs 
in maintaining the $4,000 monthly spousal support amount after 
the allocation of half of the investment income to Nicoleta.   
 HRS § 580 -47(d) (2006) provides the family court with 
further discretion to “amend or revise any order” if it 
determines there is “a material change in the physical or 
financial circumstances of either party, or upon a showing of 
other good cause  . . . .”  Therefore, a spousal support award is 
always subject to amendment upon a showing of good cause.  See 
Amii v. Amii , 5 Haw. App. 385, 391, 695 P.2d 1194, 1198 (1985) 
(“Spousal support . . . is always subject to revision upon a 
substantial and material change in the relevant 
circumstances .”). 
After the Jacoby I  remand, Nicoleta had requested an 
evidentiary hearing to de termine, inter alia, the amount of 
spousal support, asserting she never received the investment 
income since the 2011 divorce decree.  In her July 27, 2015 
memorandum, Nicoleta asserted she had not been receiving the 
investment income since the 2011 divorc e decree.  Nicoleta 
contended that this was not a circumstance contemplated by the *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
26 /s/ Mark E. Recktenwald  
 family court or the ICA, as the ICA assumed the investment 
income was divided equally because the assets generating  that 
income w ere divided equally.   
 Under the circumstan ces, the family court abused its 
discretion by denying Nicoleta’s request for an evidentiary 
hearing.  If Nicoleta did not receive her allocation of the  
investment income from the time of the 2011 divorce decree,  
Nicoleta showed good cause to have a hearin g.  Therefore, on 
remand, the family court should conduct an evidentiary hearing 
to address the issues discussed herein.  
V. Conclusion  
 For the foregoing reasons, the ICA’s May 24, 2021 judgment 
on appeal is affirmed in part and vacated in part .  We remand  
this case to the family court for further proceedings consistent 
with this opinion.
