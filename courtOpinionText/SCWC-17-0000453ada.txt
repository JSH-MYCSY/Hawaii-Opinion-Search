 OPINION OF THE COURT BY RECKTENWALD, C.J. 
 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
  This case requires us to consider the binding effect 
of a stipulation.  The parties to this foreclosure, after 
summary judgment was entered in favor of the note holder but 
before sale, entered into a stipulation in which they agreed to 
postpone the foreclosure auction while they worked to pursue a 
private sale.  No private sale came to pass, and the property 
sold at auction for less than the parties had hoped a private sale would yield.  They now dispute the effect the stipulation 
should have had on the circuit court proceedings.   
  We hold that a stipulation made during the course of 
litigation – reduced to writing, agreed to by all parties, and 
filed with the court – operates in many respects like a contract 
and generally binds the parties to its terms.  The Circuit Court 
of the First Circuit (circuit court) and Intermediate Court of 
Appeals (ICA) therefore erred by failing to treat the 
stipulation at issue as a binding agreement.   
II. BACKGROUND 
A. Circuit Court Proceedings 
 1.  Dispute and Foreclosure Proceedings 
 
This foreclosure case concerns a property in Waialua.  
In 2015, Provident Funding Associates, L.P., the note holder, ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
3 
 brought a complaint for foreclosure in the circuit court  against
(as relevant to this appeal) Travis Wittmeyer, Kanoa Bristol, 
and Blue Wave Investment Solutions, LLC (collectively, the Blue 
Wave defendants), and Gisele Gardner, the record titleholder of 
the property and the debtor.  Gardner and the Blue Wave 
defendants are also parties to another lawsuit (Gardner 
lawsuit).   It is by virtue of the Gardner lawsuit that Provident
Funding named the Blue Wave defendants in the complaint as 
possible junior interest holders.   21  
 
After summary judgment was granted to Provident 
Funding but before any foreclosure sale, Gardner found a buyer 
who was willing to purchase the property for $700,000 (a price 
that would satisfy the debt in full) and entered into a contract 
with that buyer on April 29, 2016 (April 29, 2016 transaction).  
However, the Blue Wave defendants thought the property was 
considerably more valuable and hoped to find a private buyer who 
                     
1 The Honorable Bert I. Ayabe presided until January 2017.  The 
Honorable Jeannette H. Castagnetti presided thereafter. 
 
2 According to the parties’ representations in the record of this 
case (which we offer here solely for context and do not make any suggestion 
as to their accuracy) , the Gardner lawsuit, which is currently pending in the 
circuit court, Gardner v. Wittmeyer, Civil No. 15-1- 0920-05, relates to the 
same property.  In 2009, Gardner contracted with the Blue Wave defendants to 
convey the property.  Something went wrong in the conveyance (the parties 
dispute who was at fault), but the Blue Wave defendants nonetheless took 
possession of the property, paid what was then due to the bank, and continued 
to make monthly mortgage payments until October 2014.  At that point, the 
monthly mortgage payments stopped, although the parties dispute the reason.  The mortgage went into default, giving rise to the instant foreclosure 
action.  Meanwhile, Gardner sued the Blue Wave defendants for, among other 
things, breach of contract in the Gardner lawsuit, and the Blue Wave 
defendants filed a counter- claim against Gardner.

 would pay more than $700,000.   
 
2.  The Stipulation 
 
On September 16, 2016, the parties entered into the 
First Stipulation to Continue Foreclosure Sale and Order (Stipulation).  The Stipulation provided that the foreclosure 
sale would be continued to October 25, 2016 while the defendants 
pursued a private sale.  Pursuant to the Stipulation, Gardner 
and the Blue Wave defendants agreed to try to sell the property to a third-party buyer, but if no other buyer could be found, 
they agreed to close the April 29, 2016 transaction.  In the 
event neither the April 29, 2016 transaction nor a sale to a 
different third-party buyer closed by October 25, 2016, 
Provident Funding would proceed to a foreclosure sale. 
Specifically, the Stipulation provided in relevant 
part: 
2.  Gardner, Wittmeyer, Bristol and Blue Wave will 
cooperate in a good faith effort to sell the property for 
an amount that will result in a full payoff of the loan 
owed to Provident Funding (“private sale”) and provide 
Provident Funding with a copy of all fully executed 
purchase contract(s) within 2 business days of execution 
for Provident Funding’s review and approval; 
 
3.  If there is no active purchase contract for the 
private sale of the property pending as of September 23, 
2016 or if a private sale is not closed on or before 
October 18, 2016 at 5:00pm, Gardner, Wittmeyer, Bristol and 
Blue Wave agree to proceed in good faith with the 
transaction presented to Provident Funding by Gardner with 
a purchase contract reference date of April 29, 2016 
(“April 29, 2016 transaction”) and cooperate to close the 
April 29, 2016 transaction promptly to the extent that the 
Buyer is willing and able to proceed with the transaction 
and Provident Funding approves the sale; 
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
5     (continued . . .) 
 4.  Gardner, Wittmeyer, Bristol and Blue Wave agree 
that the Court’s Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and 
Order Granting Provident Funding’ s Motion for Summary 
Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure, filed on July 28, 2016, shall remain in effect and the Commissioner shall proceed 
with the preparations for the foreclosure sale to be scheduled for a date on or about October 25, 2016, and the 
foreclosure sale itself, unless and until the closing of a 
private sale or the April 29, 2016 transaction resulting in 
the full payoff of Provident Funding. 
 The Parties agree 
that the foreclosure sale may proceed at 12:00pm (noon) on 
October 25, 2016, or anytime thereafter as scheduled by the 
Commissioner, if neither a private sale nor the April 29, 
2016 transaction has closed prior to October 25, 2016 at 
12:00pm.  
 
(Emphases added.) 
 
Further, the Stipulation provided that “[i]f a private 
sale or the April 29, 2016 transaction is consummated, Provident 
Funding will be paid in full from the sale proceeds,” Provident Funding will be dismissed from the litigation, and “[t]he 
disposition of any excess proceeds will be for the remaining 
parties and the Court to determine/decide.”  All defendants 
stipulated “that they will not seek to make Provident Funding a 
party to or otherwise involve Provident Funding in” the Gardner 
lawsuit.  The parties also agreed that “[i]f the sales proceeds 
are insufficient to pay the debt owed to Provident Funding in 
full, the case shall proceed without prejudice to Provident 
Funding’s right to obtain a deficiency judgment and other appropriate relief.”
3   
                     
3  The Stipulation also provided that, with respect to the 
property’s tenants, “[a]ll net rental income collected by the Commissioner 
until the sale of the property is completed will be applied to the 
outstanding amount owed to Provident Funding.”  Gardner agreed to “assume any 
tax liability associated with the Commissioner’s collection of rent” while 
      ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 The Stipulation was filed with the court, which signed 
the Stipulation “approved and so ordered.”  (Capitalization 
altered.)    3. The Motion to Compel 
 
On November 23, 2016,
4 Gardner filed a “Motion to 
Compel and for Sanctions” (Motion).  She represented that the 
Blue Wave defendants had “block[ed]” the April 29, 2016 
transaction in contravention of the Stipulation.  Thus, Gardner moved the court to compel the Blue Wave defendants to, among 
other things, take all necessary steps to transfer the real 
property to the April 29, 2016 transaction buyer, and asked for 
sanctions against the Blue Wave defendants.  
Gardner presented the following version of events.
5  
She claimed that she notified the Blue Wave defendants of the 
April 29, 2016 buyer in May 2016 - a transaction of which 
                     
the Blue Wave defendants agreed to “promptly pay the arrearages owed to the 
utility company, turnover all leases, keys and security deposits to the 
Commissioner and cooperate in good faith with the Commissioner’s further 
requests[.]”  The Blue Wave defendants also agreed “to take 
full[ ]responsibility for any claims made by the tenants for unreimbursed 
security deposits.”  If a private sale, the April 29, 2016 transaction, or a foreclosure sale did not result in sufficient funds to “satisfy the claims of 
the tenants,” the defendants agreed to “promptly pay into Court all amounts claimed by the tenants to be owed by the landlord[.]”   
 
4 While the Stipulation allowed the foreclosure sale to proceed on 
October 25, 2016, Gardner represented that “[o] n October 24, 2016, the 
foreclosure sale was continued until November 29, 2016 to provide additional time for the [p]arties to close the April 29, 2016 transaction or a second 
transaction[.]”   
 
5  We provide the parties’ representations about what occurred after 
the Stipulation only for background and make no suggestion about the accuracy 
of their factual claims. ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
7 
 Provident Funding approved 
- and requested “access and 
cooperation to sell the [m]ortgaged [p]roperty,” which the Blue 
Wave defendants refused.  After the parties entered into the 
Stipulation, “on or about October 12, 2016, a Purchase 
Contract . . . was fully executed between Gardner, the [Blue 
Wave] [d]efendants, and Brian Rose,” wherein Rose, a buyer found 
by the Blue Wave defendants, agreed to purchase the property for 
$789,000 ($89,000 more than the April 29, 2016 transaction sale price) (Rose contract).  However, Provident Funding refused to 
allow additional time to close the Rose contract, and instead, 
“in consequence of [the Blue Wave defendants’] lack of 
cooperation regarding rent, failure to pay outstanding utility 
bills, and the failure to open an escrow by the October 18, 2016 
deadline, the Parties[’] obligation to close the April 29, 2016 
transaction . . . was triggered.”  Thus, Provident Funding - 
over objection by the Blue Wave defendants - asked for the 
foreclosure sale to be continued for thirty days in order for the April 29, 2016 transaction to close.   
Between October 20, 2016 and October 26, 2016, the 
Blue Wave defendants asked several times to postpone the 
foreclosure sale in order to close the Rose contract.  Provident 
Funding refused, taking the position that at that point, 
Paragraph 3 of the Stipulation required the parties to cooperate 
in closing the April 29, 2016 transaction; they nonetheless ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
8 
 “stated their willingness to accept the Rose [c]ontract if it 
closed prior to the April 29, 2016 transaction[.]”  Upon 
requests by Provident Funding and Gardner for “tangible proof of 
progress” on the Rose contract, the Blue Wave defendants 
represented on November 2, 2016 that Rose would not proceed 
unless given forty-five days to close.  On November 17, 2016, 
Gardner “explained that closing the April 29, 2016 transaction 
required the [Blue Wave] [d]efendants[’] cooperation,” to which the Blue Wave defendants replied that the foreclosure auction 
date should not be extended because Rose intended to bid 
$750,000 at auction.
  From these exchanges (which occurred via 
email, of which copies were attached to the motion as exhibits), Gardner concluded that “the [Blue Wave defendants’] failure to 
respond and the tenor of the email suggests that no cooperation 
is forthcoming.”  She further represented that the April 29, 
2016 buyer remained ready, willing, and able to close.  
Accordingly, she sought a court order compelling the Blue Wave defendants to proceed with the April 29, 2016 transaction, in 
addition to sanctions against them.  4. Provident Funding’s Position Statement 
 
Provident Funding submitted a “Position Statement” 
regarding the Motion on November 23, 2016.  In it, Provident 
Funding represented that they intended to proceed with the 
November 29, 2016 foreclosure but remained willing to accept the ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
9 
 proceeds from the April 29, 2016 transaction “in satisfaction of 
the debt” so long as those proceeds were tendered no later than 
December 14, 2016.  It was Provident Funding’s position that 
“[p]er Paragraph 3” of the Stipulation, “under the present 
circumstances,” the Blue Wave defendants agreed to “proceed in 
good faith with” the April 29, 2016 transaction.  Provident 
Funding noted that if the foreclosure action were not dismissed, 
as agreed in the Stipulation, “due to the lack of cooperation by the [Blue Wave defendants],” Gardner should “bear the expense of 
moving the court for an order dismissing the case and . . . the 
[Blue Wave defendants] should be ordered to reimburse Provident 
Funding” for any costs incurred by Provident Funding “as a 
result of their failure to honor their obligations under the 
Stipulation.”  
 
 5. The Blue Wave Defendants’ Memorandum in Opposition 
 
In their memorandum in opposition (filed after the 
foreclosure auction proceeded on November 29, 2016, and the 
property was sold to Provident Funding for $447,040), the Blue 
Wave defendants characterized the post-Stipulation events as 
follows.  They alleged that they received the $789,000 offer 
that became the Rose contract in late September.  On 
September 29, 2016, the Rose contract “was signed by Mr. Rose as 
Buyer and Blue Wave and Gardner as Sellers.”  The next day, 
“Blue Wave and Gardner signed an Exclusive Right-To-Sell Listing ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
10 
 Contract” authorizing a particular realtor “to sell or exchange” 
the property.  In early October, the 
Blue Wave defendants 
communicated to Provident Funding that Rose was waiting to proceed on the sale pending their approval; on October 12, 
Provident Funding told the parties that it “would approve of the 
Rose [c]ontract, but subject to maintaining the right, under the 
First Stipulation, to move forward with the foreclosure[] sale 
on October 25, 2016 at noon if the Rose [c]ontract ha[d] not closed before then.”  The Blue Wave defendants replied that Rose 
needed more time to close.  They attempted to find out from Rose 
how much time he needed, at which point the Blue Wave defendants 
learned that “the Rose [c]ontract could not move forward until 
the other escrow” associated with the April 29, 2016 transaction 
closed.  They asked Gardner to close the other escrow, but 
“Gardner’s counsel refused[.]”   
After communicating “the escrow situation” to the 
parties, “[o]n October 19, 2016, Provident’s counsel, citing the terms of the First Stipulation, said that Provident would not 
give the Rose [c]ontract additional time to close and that 
Provident expected the parties to proceed to close the 
[April 29, 2016 transaction].”  Provident Funding denied a 
request by both defendants for a 30-day extension to close the 
Rose contract, but two days later asked the Commissioner to 
continue the foreclosure for thirty days for the April 29, 2016 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
11 
 transaction to close.  The 
Blue Wave defendants objected, 
arguing that Provident Funding should have allowed “a reasonable 
extension” for the Rose contract to close if they were willing 
to do so for the April 29, 2016 transaction.  By October 26, 
2016, Rose had made it clear to the Blue Wave defendants he 
wanted to proceed but could not close unless given forty-five 
days; he also represented to the Blue Wave defendants that at 
auction, “he would likely bid at least $750[,000] for the Property.”  On October 26, 2016, the Blue Wave defendants asked 
for an extension to allow the Rose contract to close, which 
Provident Funding denied two days later.  The Blue Wave 
defendants reiterated that Rose needed “assurance that he would 
be given a reasonable time (45 days) to close” on November 2, 
2016.  On November 17, 2016, “Blue Wave’s counsel sent to the 
parties an email objecting to any further extension of the 
foreclosure auction for the purpose of closing the [April 29, 
2016 transaction].”   
The Blue Wave defendants argued that in fact, 
Provident Funding and Gardner “did not comply with the terms of the First Stipulation, and it is unreasonable for Gardner to now 
claim that the Blue Wave [d]efendants are not complying with 
such First Stipulation,” and that they did not act in bad faith.  
Gardner and Provident Funding did not “cooperate[ ] in good 
faith with the Rose [c]ontract,” and “[i]t is unreasonable for ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
12 
 Gardner to refuse to cooperate in good faith with the Rose 
[c]ontract, and then claim that the Blue Wave [d]efendants are 
not cooperating with the [April 29, 2016 transaction].”  
 
After a hearing, the court orally denied the Motion: 
Okay.  Okay.  Well, this is a foreclosure court, and 
normally unless all the parties agree to a private sale, we 
normally agree to proceed with the foreclosure sale.  And but the court after the confirmation still has the -- still 
takes a look to see whether or not the price obtained at any confirmation is fair and reasonable so that’s something 
that would be left for the court to determine at a later 
date.
 
So with that, you know, it doesn’t seem like the 
parties have any agreement for private sale here.  The 
court will be denying this motion here today, and the court 
asks [the Blue Wave defendants’ counsel] to prepare the 
order for that. 
 
(Emphasis added.)   
  6. Confirmation of Sale 
   Provident Funding moved to confirm the sale 
thereafter.  At the hearing on the motion to confirm sale, 
bidding was reopened, which resulted in a high bid of $635,000 from Rose.  But Gardner, against whom deficiency was to be 
entered, nonetheless asked the court to: 
exercise your discretion.  And to the extent that [ ] 
requires you to set th[e circuit court’s earlier order 
denying the motion to compel and for sanctions] aside, I 
would, because the equities here, the fairness, is that my client is being subjected to this deficiency judgment.  It 
wasn’t her fault.  She had an agreement by the Court and by 
all the parties, and she complied with that.  And it would 
have resulted in zero deficiency.  And it’s not because my 
client did anything to stop that stipulation from going 
forward.  And I think, as [Provident Funding] pointed out 
in [its] brief, it’s because the [Blue Wave defendants] 
refused to adhere to that stipulation.
 
 
  The court granted Provident Funding’s motion, ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
13 
 confirming the $635,000 sale to Rose, and declined Gardner’s 
request to set aside the deficiency judgment “or any portion of 
[the court’s] order denying the motion to compel.”  It noted 
that the dispute between Gardner and the Blue Wave defendants 
should be pursued elsewhere and that “nothing . . . would 
preclude you from seeking whatever damages you believe you[] 
would be entitled to[.]”   
B.  
ICA Proceedings 
Gardner appealed, challenging (1) the circuit court’s 
conclusion that there was no agreement for a private sale, (2) the circuit court’s conclusion that the Stipulation was not 
enforceable and that the Blue Wave defendants had not breached 
it, and (3) the circuit court’s denial of the Motion.
6   
The ICA affirmed the circuit court in a Summary 
Disposition Order (SDO).  It first held that “[t]he Circuit 
Court’s finding [that] there was no agreement for a private sale 
was not clearly erroneous.”  It explained that the Stipulation must be interpreted using “contract law principles,” and “[t]o 
                     
6 Before the Blue Wave defendants filed their answering brief at 
the ICA, Gardner filed a motion for partial dismissal and a stipulation 
between herself and Provident Funding, which asserted that none of the issues on appeal pertained to Provident Funding and that both parties agreed for 
Provident Funding to be dismissed.  The Blue Wave defendants opposed 
dismissing Provident Funding, as they alleged they were neither informed that 
a dismissal was being pursued nor told of the terms of the stipulated 
dismissal, and that partial dismissals were not contemplated by the Hawaiʻ i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure.   The ICA granted the motion to dismiss, and 
Provident Funding was not involved in the appeal thereafter.  The dismissal of Provident Funding is not at issue before this court.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
14 
 be enforceable, a contract must be certain and definite as to 
its essential terms.”
  (Quoting Boteilho v. Boteilho, 58 Haw. 
40, 42, 564 P.2d 144, 146 (1977).)
  While “[t]he intent of the 
parties is a question of fact,” whether the contract is 
ambiguous is a question of law, and “[a]mbiguity in the terms of
the document raises questions regarding the parties’ intent to 
agree.”  (Citing Found Int’l Inc. v. E.T. Ige Constr., Inc., 102
Hawaiʻi 487, 497, 78 P.3d 23, 33 (2003); 1 Corbin, Contracts 
§ 4.10 (2019).)   
 
The ICA found ambiguity in the word “cooperate” as 
used in the Stipulation: “The word cooperate has two 
definitions; one definition requires collaboration, while another requires compliance with another’s directives.”  
(Citation omitted.)  Because of this ambiguity, the ICA turned 
to parol evidence in order to “explain the circumstances 
surrounding the execution of the contract[.]”  (Quoting Hokama 
v. Relinc Corp., 57 Haw. 470, 474, 559 P.2d 279, 282 (1977).) 
Applying the rule, the ICA described what the parties 
represented on the record after entering into the Stipulation: 
At the December 20, 2016 hearing,[7] the three parties’ 
counsel provided argument regarding the intent behind the 
Stipulation.  Gardner’s counsel argued the Stipulation 
arose after attempts to settle the related civil case, 
pointing to a hearing where “it was strongly pointed out 
that a joint sale would be a way to resolve this.”  [The 
Blue Wave defendants’] counsel told the court that his 
clients “continued to propose to proceed on a mutual basis 
                     
7 This hearing pertained to Gardner’s Motion and occurred nearly 
three months after the Stipulation was entered. ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
15 
 with a mutually acceptable realtor” to accomplish such a 
sale.  Provident’s attorney maintained that the Stipulation 
was drafted by Provident’ s counsel to provide the bank with 
some assurance that the parties would work to settle their “dysfunction” as an alternative to the foreclosure sale but 
gave them a deadline so the bank “would not be waiting indefinitely.” 
 
(Alterations omitted.)  
Accordingly, “[t]he parties argue on appeal that the 
Stipulation was meant to be a stipulation[,] but each cite 
different purposes.”  The ICA concluded that the Stipulation 
“lacked written terms” stating the essential elements of a 
settlement agreement, so it could not be construed as such. 
Likewise, “[t]he Circuit Court . . . considered and rejected the 
notion that the parties had an agreement for sale of land,” and consistent with that conclusion, the Stipulation also lacked the 
essential terms for a contract of that type (for instance, 
“identification of the parties, a description of the property 
sold, the price, [and] the time and manner of payment”).  
(Quoting In re Application of Sing Chong Co., Ltd., 1 Haw. App. 
236, 239, 617 P.2d 578, 581 (1980).)  
The ICA reasoned that “[a]n agreement that leaves an 
essential element ‘to be settled by further negotiation . . . is 
merely an agreement to agree and is not a valid and binding 
contract.’”  (Quoting Carson v. Saito, 53 Haw. 178, 181, 489 
P.2d 636, 638 (1971).)  “Given the essential terms the parties had left to work out regarding the sale of the property, the ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
16 
 Circuit Court was not clearly erroneous in finding lack of 
agreement on the sale. . . .  Where agreement cannot be 
ascertained from terms in the agreement or implied in law, there 
is no binding contract.”  In light of this conclusion, the ICA 
did not consider whether the Blue Wave defendants breached the 
Stipulation.  
 
Finally, the ICA determined that the circuit court did 
not abuse its discretion by denying Gardner’s motion for sanctions.  The ICA construed Gardner’s brief as alleging “that 
[the Blue Wave defendants] and attorneys should be sanctioned 
for their representation[] that a ‘potential buyer’ would bid 
(1) over $700,000 at auction and (2) at least $750,000 at 
auction, bids that ultimately failed to materialize.”  Because 
those bidders were under no obligation to bid and indeed, the 
prospect of higher bids “helped Gardner because they were the 
basis for re-opening the public sale,” such representations did 
not constitute a basis for sanctions.   C.  Supreme Court Proceedings 
Gardner presents three questions in her application 
for certiorari: (1) whether the ICA erred by affirming the 
circuit court’s conclusions that the parties had no agreement 
for a private sale, (2) whether the ICA erred by “fail[ing] to 
consider whether [the Blue Wave defendants] breached the 
Stipulation,” and (3) whether the ICA erred by concluding the ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
17 
 circuit court “did not abuse its discretion regarding Gardner’s 
motion for sanctions.”  Gardner’s application asks, among other 
things: “If parties and their attorneys can now argue that 
stipulations entered in the court’s record and approved by the 
court are not enforceable because the terms are not deemed to be 
a contract, then what value is a stipulation?”  
 
III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Interpretation of a Stipulation 
  A stipulation is reviewed using contract law 
principles.  See Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 94 (2020).  
“The construction and legal effect to be given a contract is a question of law freely reviewable by an appellate court.”

ambiguity, a question of construction arising upon the face of 
the instrument is for the court to decide.” (citation omitted)).  
B. Denial of Sanctions 
  The decision to impose sanctions is within a circuit 
court’s discretion.  Fujimoto v. Au, 95 
Hawaiʻi 116, 137, 19 P.3d 
699, 720 (2001).  A court abuses its discretion if it “clearly 
exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles 
of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party 
litigant.”  OneWest Bank, F.S.B. v. Ass’n of Owners of Kumulani ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
18 
 at Uplands at Mauna Kea, 146 
Hawaiʻi 105, 111, 456 P.3d 178, 184 
(2020) (citation omitted). 
IV. DISCUSSION 
  The circuit court’s denial of sanctions8 seemed to be 
based on its determination that the parties did not “have any 
agreement for private sale.”  The ICA likewise determined that 
there was “no binding contract” in this case.  Of course, 
sanctions cannot be imposed for violating an agreement that does 
not exist.  But the Stipulation was indeed a binding agreement, 
albeit not one for private sale, that should have been given due 
effect.  
“Any matter that involves the individual rights or 
obligations among the parties in an action or proceeding in court may properly be made the subject of a stipulation between 
them[.]”  83 C.J.S. Stipulations § 24 (2020).  Parties have 
leeway to bind themselves in a stipulation, and such agreements 
                     
8 Before filing her Opening Brief, Gardner moved first to stay the 
judgment of the circuit court confirming sale.  The ICA denied the motion, 
explaining that Gardner was required to first file a motion for a stay in the 
circuit court or otherwise explain why doing so would be “impracticable” 
pursuant to Hawaiʻ i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 8.  Thus, the 
foreclosure sale has long since happened and was not stayed, and the 
confirmation of the sale is not at issue.  In light of this backdrop, to the 
extent that Gardner challenges the circuit court’s denial of her request to 
compel the Blue Wave defendants to transfer the property to the buyer 
involved in the April 29, 2016 transaction, that issue is moot.  We agree 
with the Blue Wave defendants that, as they asserted in their response 
opposing Gardner’s application for writ of certiorari, “the only matter 
remaining before [this court] is the ICA’s decision affirming the Circuit 
Court’s Order Denying Sanctions.”

 will be broadly enforced: 
Parties by their stipulations may in many ways make the law 
for any legal proceeding to which they are parties, which 
not only binds them, but which the courts are bound to 
enforce.  They may stipulate away statutory, and even 
constitutional rights.  They may stipulate for shorter 
limitations of time for bringing actions for the breach of 
contracts than are prescribed by the statutes, such limitations being frequently found in insurance policies.  
They may stipulate that the decision of a court shall be 
final, and thus waive the right of appeal; and all such 
stipulations not unreasonable, not against good morals or 
sound public policy, have been and will be enforced; and, 
generally, all stipulations made by parties for the 
government of their conduct or the control of their rights 
in the trial of a cause or the conduct of a litigation are 
enforced by the courts.  
 
Okuhara v. Broida, 51 Haw. 253, 256–57, 456 P.2d 228, 230–31 
(1969) (citation omitted) (emphases added). 
  In short, then, “parties ordinarily are bound by the 
terms of their stipulations[.]”  Gakiya v. Hallmark Props., 
Inc., 68 Haw. 550, 555, 722 P.2d 460, 464 (1986); Yoneji v. 
Yoneji, 137 Hawaiʻi 299, 315, 370 P.3d 704, 720 (App. 2016) (“A 
trial court is bound to follow the procedures set forth in a stipulation, unless there was a finding of manifest injustice.”); see also Moore v. Richard W. Farms, Inc., 437 
S.E.2d 529, 531 (N.C. Ct. App. 1993) (“Once a stipulation is made, a party is bound by it[.]”); Nishman v. De Marco, 76 
A.D.2d 360, 368 (N.Y. App. Div. 1980) (“The judicial policy in favor of the enforcement of stipulations . . . has found 
widespread application.”).   
  Stipulations are interpreted by applying principles of 
contract law.  73 Am. Jur. 2d Stipulations § 6 (2020) (“The ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
20 
 rules of contract interpretation apply to stipulations.”); see 
Burlington Ditch Reservoir & Land Co. v. Metro Wastewater 
Reclamation Dist., 256 P.3d 645, 676 (Colo. 2011) (“Stipulations 
are contracts, binding upon their signatory parties, and 
interpreted under contract law principles.”); Czumak v. N.H. 
Div. of Developmental Servs., 923 A.2d 208, 213 (N.H. 2007) (“A 
stipulated agreement is contractual in nature and, therefore, is 
governed by contract rules.”); Nishman, 76 A.D.2d at 366 (“A 
stipulation is a contract between parties, and as such is 
governed by general principles for its interpretation and 
effect[.]”).  Unlike contracts, however, they generally need not 
be supported by consideration to be enforceable.  Lillard Pipe & 
Supply, Inc. v. Bailey, 387 P.2d 118, 122 (Okla. 1963) 
(“Although stipulations are unlike ordinary contracts in that no 
consideration or mutuality is required, they are to be construed 
like other contracts between parties.”); 73 Am. Jur. 2d 
Stipulations § 1 (2020) (“While a stipulation has been described 
as a contract, some of their incidents do not inhere in ordinary 
contracts.  Thus, for example, no consideration is necessary to 
the validity of a stipulation, and no mutuality is required.” 
(footnotes omitted)). 
  The ICA determined that the “lack of essential terms” 
in the Stipulation to create either a settlement agreement or a 
contract for the sale of land rendered it so uncertain as to be ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
21 
 unenforceable.  While it is true that a contract indeed may fail
for lack of definiteness, such a construction is disfavored, and
the Stipulation here survives that inquiry.  “To be enforceable,
a contract must be certain and definite as to its essential 
terms.”  Boteilho, 58 Haw. at 42, 564 P.2d at 146; see also 
Honolulu Waterfront Ltd. P’ship v. Aloha Tower Dev. Corp., 692 
F. Supp. 1230, 1236 (D. Haw. 1988) (recognizing that under 
Hawaiʻi law, contracts may be too indefinite to be enforceable) 
(citing Sing Chong, 1 Haw. App. at 239, 617 P.2d at 581).  “The 
terms of a contract are reasonably certain if they provide a 
basis for determining the existence of a breach and for giving 
an appropriate remedy.”  Almeida v. Almeida, 4 Haw. App. 513, 519, 669 P.2d 174, 179 (App. 1983) (quoting Restatement (Second)
of Contracts § 33 (1981)).  However, “the law leans against the 
destruction of contracts for uncertainty.  Courts favor the 
determination that an agreement is sufficiently definite.  We 
will, if possible, so construe the agreement so as to carry into
effect the intention of the parties.”  Sing Chong, 1 Haw. App. 
at 239, 617 P.2d at 581 (citation omitted); see also Hi-Pac, Ltd. v. Avoset Corp., 26 F. Supp. 2d 1230, 1235 (D. Haw. 1997).   
 
 
 
  
The ICA misapplied this doctrine when it attempted to 
map the essential terms of a settlement agreement or of a 
contract for sale of land onto the Stipulation.  That the 
Stipulation is neither does not end the inquiry.  Instead, the ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
22 
 ICA should have avoided “the destruction of contracts for 
uncertainty” and “construe[d] the agreement [so] as to carry 
into effect the intention of the parties” as embodied by the 
agreement if possible.  Sing Chong, 1 Haw. App. at 239, 617 P.2d 
at 581.   
Here, an enforceable construction of the Stipulation 
is possible.  The Stipulation bound the parties to use good faith efforts to either close a private sale or close the April 29, 2016 transaction by the agreed-upon deadline.  Per 
Paragraph 3 of the Stipulation, “If there is no active purchase 
contract for the private sale of the property pending as of 
September 23, 2016, or if a private sale is not closed on or 
before October 18, 2016,” the parties “agree[d] to proceed in 
good faith” and to “cooperate to close the April 29, 2016 
transaction
.”  Thus, the Stipulation provided, as relevant here, 
the following terms: (1) All defendants would “cooperate in a good faith effort to sell the property” to a third-party buyer; (2) If no private sale closed before October 18, 2016, the 
parties would “proceed in good faith with” and “cooperate to 
close the April 29, 2016 transaction”; (3) During this period, 
Provident Funding would not seek a foreclosure sale; and (4) If 
neither a third-party contract nor the April 29, 2016 
transaction closed, a foreclosure sale would proceed.  These 
terms are sufficiently definite because they “provide a basis ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
23 
 for determining the existence of a breach and for giving an 
appropriate remedy.”  Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 33 
(1981).  Gardner or the Blue Wave defendants would have breached 
if either one failed to “cooperate in a good faith effort” to find a third-party buyer or, in the event no private sale closed 
by October 18, 2016, if either one failed to “cooperate to 
close” the April 29, 2016 transaction.   
  Even if there were some ambiguity in the Stipulation, 
we disagree with the ICA that an ambiguity in a contractual term casts doubt on whether the parties intended to be bound at all.  
To the contrary, in the face of an ambiguity, “[t]he court’s 
objective is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the 
parties as manifested by the contract in its entirety.”  
Hawaiian Ass’n of Seventh-Day Adventists v. Wong, 130 Hawaiʻ i 36, 
45, 305 P.3d 452, 461 (2013) (quotation marks and citation 
omitted) (emphasis added).  Indeed, although the parties later 
in the proceedings offered different perspectives on why they 
entered into the Stipulation, the purposes presented by the 
parties – while relevant to resolving ambiguity – are irrelevant to the objective inquiry over whether the parties intended to be 
bound at all.  Earl M. Jorgensen Co. v. Mark Constr., Inc., 56 
Haw. 466, 470, 540 P.2d 978, 982 (1975) (“The existence of 
mutual assent or intent to accept is determined by an objective 
standard.”).  That test is whether the parties’ “words or acts ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
24 
 . . . under a standard of reasonableness . . . manifested an 
objective intention to agree.”  Id.  Even if the parties had 
argued that they did not enter the Stipulation with the intent 
to form a binding agreement,  the fact that they signed the 
Stipulation and filed it with the court leaves a reasonable observer no doubt that the parties mutually assented to be bound 
by the Stipulation’s terms.   9
  We therefore must look to the instrument itself to 
discern whether its terms are clear, and although our goal is to 
effectuate the parties’ intent, we must glean that intent from 
the Stipulation itself.  83 C.J.S. Stipulations § 46 (2020) 
(“The primary rule is that the court must, if possible, ascertain and give effect to the intent of the parties. . . .  
An appellate court analyzes the language of a stipulation to 
determine the parties’ intentions and ends its inquiry if the 
language is clear.” (footnotes omitted)).  “It is well settled 
that courts should not draw inferences from a contract regarding the parties’ intent when the contract is definite and 
unambiguous.”  State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Pac. Rent-All, 
Inc., 90 Hawaiʻi 315, 324, 978 P.2d 753, 762 (1999) (citing 
Hanagami v. China Airlines, Ltd., 67 Haw. 357, 364, 688 P.2d 
                     
9  No party argued as much, and indeed, the Blue Wave defendants’ 
memorandum in opposition to the Motion and their answering brief at the ICA 
claimed that it was Gardner and Provident Funding who breached – an argument 
predicated on the Stipulation being binding.    ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
25 We disagree with the ICA that the Stipulation is 
ambiguous.  “Contract terms are interpreted according to their 
plain, ordinary, and accepted sense in common speech.”  Id.  “A 
contract is ambiguous when its terms are reasonably susceptible 
to more than one meaning.”  Id.  The ICA found ambiguity in the 
term “cooperate,” which it concluded could be reasonably 
construed to either require “collaboration” or “compliance with 
another’s directives.”  To “cooperate” means “to act or work 
with another or others.”  Cooperate, Merriam-Webster.com 
Dictionary, 275 (11th ed. 2009), https://perma.cc/X9BJ-ZUJR.  
The other dictionary cited by the ICA, Macmillan, likewise 
defines cooperate as: “to work with other people to achieve a 
result that is good for everyone involved.”  Cooperate, 
Macmillan Dictionary Online, https://perma.cc/5UXP-SP3S.  
Black’s Law Dictionary similarly defines “cooperation 
agreement” as “any contract by which the parties bind 
themselves to work jointly towards some mutually beneficial 
ends.”  Cooperation 1139, 1144 (1984)).  While the parties disagreed ex post about the 
Stipulation’s meaning and effect, this disagreement “does not render 
clear language ambiguous.”  State Farm, 90 Hawaiʻi at 324, 978 P.2d at 
762.  Instead, “[a]s a general rule, the court will look no further than 
the four corners of the contract to determine whether an ambiguity 
exists.”  Hawaiian Ass’n of Seventh-Day Adventists, 130 Hawaiʻi at 45, 
  305 P.3d at 461. ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
26 
 agreement, Black’s Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019) (emphasis 
added).  In essence, then, to cooperate means to work together. 
  The second definition in Macmillan does pertain to, as 
the ICA put it, “compliance with another’s directives”: “to do 
what someone asks you to do, especially by providing them with 
information.”  Macmillan Dictionary Online, 
https://perma.cc/5UXP-SP3S.  However, this definition does not 
fit within the context of the Stipulation, which requires the parties to cooperate - implicitly, with each other.  See Found. 
Int’l, 102 Hawaiʻ i at 496–97, 78 P.3d at 32–33 (“[T]he test [of 
ambiguity] lies not necessarily in the presence of particular 
ambiguous words or phrases but rather in the purport of the document itself, whether or not particular words or phrases in 
themselves be uncertain or doubtful in meaning.” (emphasis 
added)); Cherokee Metro. Dist. v. Upper Black Squirrel Creek 
Designated Ground Water Mgmt. Dist., 247 P.3d 567, 573 (Colo. 
2011) (“To determine whether there is ambiguity [in a 
stipulation], courts must examine the instrument’s language and 
construe it in harmony with the plain and generally accepted meaning of the words employed.”).  The Stipulation does not 
require the Blue Wave defendants to cooperate with Gardner (or 
vice versa), nor does it contemplate who would be giving the 
directives if that were what “cooperate” meant.  Thus, the term 
“cooperate” as used in the agreement is not “reasonably ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
27 
 susceptible” to the ICA’s other suggested definition.  Hawaiian 
Ass’n of Seventh-Day Adventists, 130 Hawaiʻ i at 45, 305 P.3d at 
461.     
  Accordingly, the commonly-understood meaning of 
cooperate - to work together - applies, and we need not look 
beyond the Stipulation itself because the intentions of the 
parties are clear from the instrument.  When the Stipulation 
required the parties to “cooperate to close the April 29, 2016 
transaction,” it bound the parties to work together to close the 
April 29, 2016 transaction once that provision was triggered 
(which would occur if no private sale closed before October 18, 
2016).  Said differently, once no private sale closed by October 18, 2016, the parties were obliged to work together to 
close the April 29, 2016 transaction.  To be sure, the 
Stipulation was not an agreement for the sale of the property – 
it did not purport to transfer title to one of the signatories – 
nor was it a settlement – it did not relinquish any party’s 
claims in the lawsuit.  It was, however, an agreement with 
discernible and enforceable terms, which “not only binds [the parties], but which the courts are bound to enforce.”  Okuhara, 
51 Haw. at 256, 456 P.2d at 230. 
  Importantly, however, this rule is subject to 
exceptions.  We noted in Gakiya that “certain stipulations [may] 
be set aside or modified in order to prevent manifest ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
28 
 injustice.”  68 Haw. at 555, 722 P.2d at 464 (determining that 
“the prevention of manifest injustice required . . . a departure 
[from the stipulation] in this case” because enforcing the 
stipulation would have left a party who had suffered “serious 
financial injury” “with virtually no source of relief”); see 
also 83 C.J.S. Stipulations § 1 (2020) (“Valid stipulations 
entered into freely and fairly should not be lightly set aside,” 
but may be “when their enforcement would result in serious harm to one of the parties and the other party would not be 
prejudiced by their being set aside.” (footnote omitted)).  In 
addition, “the parties’ stipulation as to a question of law is 
not binding on the court[.]”  Hawaiian Ass’n of Seventh-Day 
Adventists, 130 Hawai
ʻi at 46, 305 P.3d at 462. 
  Moreover, we recognize that the Stipulation was made 
in the course of a mortgage foreclosure proceeding, which is 
“equitable in nature and is thus governed by the rules of 
equity.”  Santiago v. Tanaka, 137 Hawaiʻ i 137, 157, 366 P.3d 612, 
632 (2016) (quoting Beneficial Haw., Inc. v. Kida, 96 Hawaiʻi 
289, 312, 30 P.3d 895, 918 (2001)).  “Courts of equity have the 
power to mold their decrees to conserve the equities of the 
parties under the circumstances of the case.”  Peak Cap. Grp., 
LLC v. Perez, 141 Hawaiʻi 160, 179, 407 P.3d 116, 135 (2017) 
(citation omitted).  “In general, stipulations are not to be 
lightly set aside.”  In re Lenox, 902 F.2d 737, 739 (9th Cir. ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
29 
 1990).  In an equitable foreclosure proceeding, a trial court 
should enforce the terms of a stipulation unless doing so would 
be inequitable.  Wilson v. Witt, 952 P.2d 214, 216 (Wyo. 1998) 
(“[A court’s authority to alter or nullify a contract] does not 
extend so far as to authorize a court of equity to disregard and 
set aside a valid stipulation of the parties upon the 
performance of which their rights are made to depend in the 
absence of some equitable basis.” (emphasis added) (citation 
omitted)). 
  Although trial courts generally have wide latitude to 
deny sanctions, here, the record is devoid of any other basis 
for which the sanctions motion was denied besides the erroneous 
conclusion that the Stipulation was not binding.  The circuit 
court therefore erred, and we remand this case for further 
proceedings.   
  This decision neither opines on whether sanctions 
would or would not be appropriate on remand, nor suggests anyone 
necessarily breached the Stipulation.  Indeed, it may well be 
the case that sanctions are inappropriate and that all parties 
complied with the Stipulation’s terms.  We write today solely to 
clarify that agreements made during the course of litigation, 
reduced to writing, signed by all parties, and given the 
imprimatur of the court must generally be treated as binding.  
“In essence, a stipulation is a contract, or at least akin to ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
30 
 one, and is entitled to all the sanctity of a conventional 
contract.”  83 C.J.S. Stipulations § 1 (2020) (footnotes 
omitted).  In addition to the well-established principles of law undergirding this holding, sound policy reasons support it as 
well.  The stipulation in this case represented a mutual 
agreement to pursue a sale that presumably would leave all 
parties better off, potentially avoiding a costly judicial 
process and resolving the litigation amicably.  Agreement between adversarial parties on issues during the litigation 
makes the litigation process smoother and less costly for all.  
But if stipulations are not given binding effect, then parties 
will be less likely to enter into them for fear that they will 
later be rendered toothless.  In short, parties must be able to 
rely on the terms of an agreement and arrange their affairs in 
accordance therewith, and accordingly, absent a sufficient 
reason to set them aside, stipulations are binding on those who 
agree to them. 
V. CONCLUSION 
  For the foregoing reasons, the ICA’s January 3, 2020 judgment on appeal and the circuit court’s May 5, 2017 judgment 
are vacated in part, with respect to the circuit court’s 
January 6, 2017 Order Denying Sanctions, but are otherwise
