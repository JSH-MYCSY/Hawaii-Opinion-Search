 riding the bus home from work.   After making several 
unsuccessful attempts to wake Ernes, who appeared intoxicated, 
representatives of the bus company called the Honolulu Police 
Department ( “HPD”) to request assistance.   An HPD o fficer 
responded to the scene and succeeded in waking Ernes  through 
sternum rubs .  Apparently startled, Ernes then punched the HPD 
officer in the face wit h his fist .  He was arrested, charged, 
and convicted  after a bench trial .2  The Intermediate Court of 
Appeals (“ICA”) affirmed Ernes’s conviction in a summary 
disposition order (“SDO”).  State v. Ernes , CAAP-17-0000507, 
2019 WL 2929017 (Haw. App. July 8, 2019).     
 Ernes presents  the following question  on certiorari:  
Whether the I CA gravely erred in finding that the District 
Court did not reversibly err in failing to obtain a valid 
on-the-record waiver of Ernes’ constitutional right to a 
jury trial.   
 
 We hold that under the totality of the circumstances,  
taking into account the defendant ’s language barrier  and the 
 
(continued. . .) 
if the person recklessly causes bodily injury 
to a law enforcement officer who is engaged in 
the performance of duty.  
 
(2) Assault of a law enforcement officer in the 
second degree is a misdemeanor.  The court 
shall sentence the person who has been 
convicted of this offense to a definite term of 
imprisonment, pursuant to section 706 -663, of 
not less than thirty days without possibility 
of probation or suspension of sentence.  
 
2  The Honorable Paula Devens presid ed.   Ernes was sentenced to the 
mandatory 30 days of imprisonment, see supra note 1, and his sentence was 
stayed pending appeal.

 lack of information r egarding defendant ’s background and  
experience , State v. Gomez -Lobato, 130 Hawaiʻi 465, 472, 312 P.3d 
897, 904 (2013), the record does not reflect a n on-the-record 
exchange sufficient to constitute the true colloquy required to 
establish a knowing and  intelligent  waiver of Ernes ’s 
constitutional right to a jury trial.  State v. Baker , 132 
Hawaiʻi 1, 6, 319 P.3d 1009, 1014 (2014).   
II.  Background  
A. District court proceedings  
 On February 15, 2017, the district court3 held a hearing to 
determine whether Ernes would demand a jury trial or whether he 
would waive that right.   Ernes was provided with a court -
appointed Chuukese interpreter.   Defense counsel opened by 
stating, “Your Honor, at this time, my client will be wai ving 
his right to jury trial, will be pleading not guilty, [and will 
be] asking for . . . a Chuukese interpreter for trial.”   The 
district court then addressed Ernes as follows:4 
Court: Okay, good morning, Mr. Ernes.  
 
Ernes: (In English)  Good morning.  
 
 
3  The Honorable Lono J. Lee presided.  
 
4  In the transcript for this hearing, when Ernes responded to the 
district court directly, without the interpreter’s assistance, the court 
reporter specifically indicated in the transcript that Ernes spoke “(In 
English).”  When Ernes responded to the district court in Chuukese, requiring 
the interpreter’s assistance, the  court reporter specifically indicated that 
Ernes spoke “(Through the interpreter).”  
 **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
4 
 Court: I just received a waiver of jury trial 
form.[5]  Did you sign it?  
 
Ernes: (Through the interpreter)  Yes.  
 
Court: Okay.  Did you review it with your 
attorney?  
 
Ernes: (Through the interpreter)  Yes.  
 
Court: Okay.  Did she explain to you w hat a jury 
trial is?  
 
Ernes: (In English)  Yes.  
 
Court: Okay.  For the record, a jury trial is 
where you have an opportunity to help 
select 12 people from the community.  The 
State needs to prove its case beyond a 
reasonable doubt to all 12 jurors, and 
all 12 jurors must agree before you can 
be found guilty.  Is that your 
understanding?  
 
Ernes: (Through the interpreter)  Yes.  
 
Court: Yes.  Okay.  Is your mind clear today?  
 
Ernes: (In English)  Yes.  
 
Court: Okay, how much education do you have?  
High school?  College?  
 
Ernes: (In English)  No, just have high school.  
 
Court: High school?  Okay.  Do you understand 
your right to a jury trial?  
 
Ernes: (Through the interpreter)  Yes.  
 
Court: Yes.  Is anyone forcing you to give up 
this right?  
 
Ernes: (In English)  No.  
 
5 Because Ernes’s waiver of jury trial form was omitted from the record 
on appeal, the ICA entered an order directing the district court clerk to 
file a supplemental reco rd on appeal including the form.  However, the clerk 
was unable to locate the form.  The parties therefore stipulated to, inter 
alia, the following facts:  Ernes executed a waiver of jury trial form, 
affixing his signature on the form after a paragraph sta ting, “I hereby waive 
and give up my right to be tried by a jury and agree that my case may be 
tried by a single judge.”  The district court received the form and filed it 
in open court.                                                                                                                                               **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **

Court: All right, thank you.  Court will find 
defendant knowing, voluntary, 
(indiscernible) right to jury trial, 
enter a not guilty plea, request Chuukese 
interpreter next proceeding.  
  
 The district court accepted Ernes’ s jury trial waiver and 
not guilty  plea.  Ernes was convicted after a bench trial.6   
B. ICA proceedings  
 Ernes appealed his conviction to the I CA.  With respect to 
the jury trial waiver issue,7 the ICA concluded that  Ernes failed 
to carry his burden to demonstrate that his jury trial waiver 
was involuntary.   Ernes, SDO at 2.   The ICA reasoned : 
Ernes does not dispute that he signed a Waiver of 
Jury Trial form that waived his right to a jury 
trial.  Ernes admits that the District Court 
thereafter inquired whether Ernes reviewed the waiver 
form, whether his attorney reviewed the form with 
him, whether his attorney explained the concept of a 
jury trial, whether he understood that a jury trial 
is an opportunity to help select twelve people from 
the community, and whether he understood that the 
State was required to prove its case beyond a 
reasonable doubt to all twelve jurors, and all twelve 
jurors must agree before he can be found guilty.  
Ernes answered in the affirmative to all of those 
inquiries.  Therefore, it appears from the record 
that Ernes voluntarily waived his right to a jury 
trial and, thus, he has the burden to demonstrate by 
a preponderance of the evidence that his waiver was 
involuntary.  
 
 
 
6  Ernes was sentenced to the mandatory 30 days of imprisonment, see supra 
note 2, and his sentence was stayed pending appeal.  
 
7  Ernes raised two additional points of error before the ICA: (1) the 
State failed to present sufficient evidence that he acted recklessly; and (2) 
the State did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt facts negating self -
defense.  The ICA resolved these points of error by concluding that, “[w]hen 
the evidence a dduced at trial is considered in the strongest light for the 
prosecution, . . . there was sufficient evidence to convict Ernes of Assault 
Against a Law Enforcement Officer in the Second Degree.”  Ernes, SDO at 4.  **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
6 
 Ernes, SDO at 2 -3 (internal quotation marks, brackets, and 
ellipsis omitted).   
 The ICA cited to State v. Macaso, No. CAAP -15-0000198, 2016 
WL 2941071 (Haw. App. Apr . 13, 2016), for the proposition that 
“stopping and addressing Ernes after stating each component of a 
jury trial” was not required for the district court to obtain a 
valid waiver of his right to a jury trial.   Ernes, SDO at 3 .  
The ICA also determined that Ernes “failed to point to any 
specific facts to support his claim that the colloquy conducted 
[by the district court] was insufficient.”  Id.  It therefore 
concluded that Ernes knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily 
waived his right to a jury trial.   Id.    
C. Certiorari application  
 On certiorari, Ernes contends that the ICA misconstrued his 
argument on appeal:  
The ICA contended that Petitioner argued that the court was 
required to present the concept of the jury trial int o 
“segments[,”] pausing after each “right[.]”  . . .  [T]he 
ICA noted its determination in [ Macaso] that “stopping 
after each right of the Tachibana  advisement to determine 
whether the defendant understands that right is not a per 
se requirement for an adequate Tachibana  colloquy.”  
 
That is not the point in this case.  Petitioner is not 
arguing for a per se requirement in the taking of an oral 
jury waiver, even after a written waiver has been signed.  
Rather, Petitioner is advocating the required colloquy  
actually be  . . . what it was intended to be, i.e., a 
conversation between a defendant and the court [that] 
allows the court to determine that the de fendant has an 
actual understanding of the rights that the defendant is 
waiving.  
 **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
7 
 Ernes further argues on certiorari that the district court’s 
colloquy was defective because it failed to engage him in a 
verbal exchange in which it ascertained his understan ding of the 
proceedings and his rights, c iting to State v. Celestine , 142 
Hawaiʻi 165, 170, 415 P.3d 907, 912 (2018) , and State v. Pomroy , 
132 Hawaiʻi 85, 93, 319 P.3d 1093, 1101 (2014) .  He maintains  
that the district court’s “single compound question” and his 
one-word answers did not constitute a true colloquy, but rather 
was in the nature of an advisement.   In addition, Ernes asserts 
that “[it] is revealing that [although he] answered some 
questions  in English, [he] had to answer the single jury trial 
rights question through the interpreter.”  He further argues 
that the district court did not properly consider the fact that 
he required the assistance of an interpreter.   Ernes also 
contends the distri ct court failed to “ask any questions to 
elicit whether [he] had any limitations [that] might influence 
his comprehension of the compound question regarding his jury 
trial rights.”   Ernes concludes that the jury trial waiver was 
invalid because the distric t court failed to engage him in “any 
exchange to ascertain whether [the] waiver of his jury trial 
right was based on his understanding of [that] right[.]”  
III.  Standard of review 
 The validity of a criminal defendant’s waiver of 
[the] right to a jury trial presents a question of state 
and federal constitutional law. . . .  We answer questions 
of constitutional law by exercising our own independent **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
8 
 constitutional judgment based on th e facts of the case.  
Thus, we review questions of constitutional law under the 
right/wrong standard.  
 
Gomez-Lobato, 130 Hawaiʻi at 468-69, 312 P.3d at 900 -01 (citation 
omitted).  
IV.  Discussion  
 When a criminal defendant has the right to a jury trial, 
the trial court is required to “inform the defendant of the 
right to jury trial in the circuit court[,] and that the 
defendant may elect to be tried without a jury  in the district 
court.”  Hawaiʻi Rules of Penal Procedure ( “HRPP”) Rule 5(b)(1) 
(2014).  This serves several purposes: “(1) it more effectively 
insures voluntary, knowing , and intelligent waivers[;] (2) it 
promotes judicial economy by avoiding challenges to the validity 
of waivers on appeal[;] and (3) it emphasizes to the defendant 
the seriousness of the decision[.]”  State v. F riedman, 93 
Hawaiʻi 63, 68, 996 P.2d 268, 273 (2000) (quoting United States 
v. Cochran , 770 F.2d 850, 851 -52 (9th Cir. 1985)).   
 A defendant may waive the right to trial by jury either 
orally or in writing , provided that such waiver is knowing and 
voluntary, and comes directly from the defendant.  State v. 
Ibuos, 75 Hawaiʻi 118, 121, 857 P.2d 576, 578 (1993).  But, even 
where the de fendant executes a written waiver form, “the court 
should also engage in an oral colloquy with the defendant to 
establish that the waiver was knowing, intelligent, and **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
9 
 voluntary.”  Gomez-Lobato, 130 Hawaiʻi at 469, 312 P.3d at 901.  
The validity of a defendant’s waiver of the right to a jury 
trial is reviewed “under the totality of the circumstances 
surrounding the case, taking into account the defendant’s 
background, experience, and conduct.”  Friedman , 93 Hawaiʻi at 
70, 996 P.2d at 275 (citation omitted).  As set forth below, 
under the totality of the circumstances surrounding the case, 
the district court’s colloquy was insufficient in establishing a 
valid waiver of Ernes’ s right to a jury trial.  
 Our anal ysis of the validity of Ernes’ s jury trial waiver 
is guided by Gomez-Lobato, 130 Hawaiʻi 465, 312 P.3d 897 ; 
Friedman , 93 Hawaiʻi 63, 996 P.2d 268 ; State v. H an, 130 Hawaiʻi 
83, 306 P.3d 128  (2013); and United States v. Duarte-Higareda , 
113 F.3d 1000 (9th Cir. 1997).   
 The defendant in Duarte-Higareda  did not speak English , yet 
he executed a jury trial waiver form written entirely in 
English.  Duarte-Higareda, 113 F.3d at 1002.   At a pretrial 
hearing, defense counsel stated, “T he defendant and I have had 
an opportunity to discuss the matter.  We would waive a jury.  I 
believe it’s beneficial to him to do that, after he and I 
discussed it on two occasions.”  Id.  Although a Spanish 
language interpreter was present to assist the d efendant , the **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
10 
 record did not reflect whether the form was sight-translated8  
into Spanish for the defendant.  Id.  Before trial, the district 
court asked defense counsel, “I s this still a court trial?” and 
defense counsel responded, “Yes, your Honor.”  Id.  The district 
court proceeded to trial without questioning Duarte -Higareda 
about the waiver form or his understanding of the right to a 
jury trial.  Id.  
 The Ninth Circuit discussed the following guidelines set 
forth for determining whether a  defendant’s jury trial waiver is 
valid:  
The district court should inform the defendant that (1) 
twelve members of the community compose a jury, (2) the 
defendant may take part in jury selection, (3) a jury 
verdict must be unanimous, and (4) the court alo ne decides 
guilt or innocence if the defendant waives a jury trial.  
Furthermore, the district court should question the 
defendant to ascertain whether the defendant understands 
the benefits and burdens of a jury trial and freely chooses 
to waive a jury tr ial. 
 
Id. (citations omitted).   Although the Ninth Circuit 
acknowledged that a colloquy informing the defendant of the four 
primary components of a jury trial is not required in every 
case, it noted that, “where the record indicates a special 
 
8  “Sight-translation” involves the oral translation of a document.  
Taniguchi v. Kan Pac. Saipan, Ltd. , 566 U.S. 560, 573 -74 (2012).  Thus, 
“sight-translation” in this context would have involved the interpreter 
orally translating the English language jury t rial waiver form into Spanish 
for Duarte -Higareda.  Without a sight -translation, a person with limited 
English proficiency would not understand the document to which a signature is 
affixed.  Although defense counsel may have followed our guidance in Gomez-
Lobato that “where a defendant needs the assistance of an interpreter, 
defense counsel  is obligated to explain any waiver of the defendant’s 
constitutional rights through an interpreter[,]” 130 Hawaiʻi at 472 n.8, 312 
P.3d at 904 n.8 (emphasis omitted), it  is incumbent on the court to confirm 
that fact in the colloquy.    **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
11 
 disadvantage or disability bearing upon the d efendant’s 
understanding of the jury waiver, the district court must 
conduct a colloquy with the defendant to ensure that the waiver 
is voluntary , knowing, and intelligent.”  113 F.3d  at 1003 
(citing United States v. Christensen , 18 F.3d 822, 82 5 (9th Cir.  
1994)).  The Ninth Circuit explained:  
Duarte[-Higareda’s] language barrier . . . is a “salient 
fact” that was known to the district court and put the 
court on notice that [his] waiver “might be less than 
knowing and intelligent,” [ Christensen ,] 18 F.3d a t 825.  
Under these circumstances, the district court was obliged 
to conduct a colloquy with Duarte[ -Higareda] to carry out 
its “serious and weighty responsibility” of ensuring that a 
defendant’s jury waiver is voluntary, knowing, and 
intelligent.  By fail ing to address Duarte[ -Higareda] at 
all, the district court failed to discharge this 
responsibility.  
 
Id. (citation omitted).  
 Similarly, the defendant in Gomez-Lobato executed a written 
jury trial waiver form in English despite not being fluent in 
English.  130 Hawaiʻi at 466, 312 P.3d at 898.  During a pre -
trial hearing, in which the defendant had the assistance of a 
court-appointed interpreter, the family court quest ioned him 
regarding the waiver form as follows:  
  Court:   Good morning, Mr. Gomez[ -]Lobato.  I have 
with me a waiver of jury trial form.  Are 
these your initials, and is this your 
signature on this form?  
 
Defendant:  Yes. 
 
Court: Prior to placing your initials and 
signature on this form, did you 
understand what you were doing and 
signing?  
 
Defendant:  Yes. **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
12 
  
Court: And was that explained to you in Spanish?  
 
Defendant:  Yes. 
 
Court: Did you discuss this with your attorney?  
 
Defendant:  Yes. 
 
Court: Okay.  Do you have any questions for me?  
 
Defendant:  No. 
 
Court: Okay.  The Court concludes that the 
defendant knowingly, voluntarily, 
intelligently waived his rights to a jury 
trial. 
 
130 Hawaiʻi at 468, 312 P.3d at 899  (capitalization removed) . 
 Although the waiver form was transla ted for Gomez-Lobato, 
and the court communicated with him through the interpreter, 
this court held that, under Duarte-Higareda , the language 
barrier between Gomez-Lobato and the family court was a “salient 
fact” that should have prompted the family court to ask 
additional questions to verify that Gomez-Lobato understood the 
right he was waiving.  130 Hawaiʻi at 471, 312 P.3d at 903.  We 
explained:  
[I]n light of Gomez -Lobato’s language barrier, his 
affirmative answers to each of [the family court’s] 
questions did not establish that he understood he was 
waiving his right to a jury trial.  
 
This is particularly true where, as here, the record 
contains little information with respect to the defendant’s 
background, experience and conduct.  Friedman , 93 Hawaiʻi at 
70, 966 P.2d at 275. . . .  Indeed, there is nothing in the 
record to indicate Gom ez-Lobato’s educational or employment 
background, or experience with the criminal justice system, 
that could establish that he understood his right to a jury 
trial. 
 
130 Hawaiʻi at 472, 312 P.3d at 904  (footnote omitted) . **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
13 
  Although we recognized that “ courts are best situated to 
determine what questions need to be asked of individual 
defendants,” we determined that, under Duarte-Higareda , the 
family court’s questions were insufficient to ascertain that 
Gomez-Lobato understood his right  to a jury trial.  Id. 
(footnote omitted).  We therefore held that the family court 
erred in finding Gomez -Lobato’s waiver to be voluntary, knowing, 
and intelligent.  130 Hawaiʻi at 473, 312 P.3d at 906.  
 Han, which addressed a Tachibana9 colloquy, is relevant to 
colloquy requirements when a language barrier exists.  In Han, 
two advisements took place regarding the defendant’s right to 
testify, one before trial began, and one at the close of the 
defendant’s case, as required by Tachibana .  130 Hawaiʻi at 85-
86, 306 P.3d at 1 31-32.  A Korean language interpreter was sworn 
in to interpret  both.  130 Hawaiʻi at 85, 306 P.3d at 131.   The 
Tachibana  colloquy given at the close of the case was as 
follows:  
  Court: Oh, okay.  All right.  And so let me take  
  this opportunity, then, to question your   
  client again and  -- before we bring in   
  our jury.  All right, [Petitioner], good   
  morning.   Your attorney just informed the  
  court that you are not going to testify   
  on your behalf.  
 
 
9  Tachibana v. State , 79 Hawaiʻi 226, 900 P.2d 1293 (1995), holding that 
trial courts must advise criminal defendants of their right to testify and 
must obtain an on -the-record waiver of that right in every case in which the 
defendant does not testify.   
 **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
14 
 Han:  (Through the interpreter) Yes.  
 
Court: Okay.  All right, remember in the beginning  —— 
beginning of our trial, this  court advised you 
of your rights.  And that is, one, you have the 
right to testify on your behalf, and that  —— 
that decision to testify  —— whether to testify 
or not is your decision alone and that nobody 
can force you to testify.  And then, of course, 
second, you also have the constitutional right 
to remain silent and th at if you decide to 
exercise your right to remain silent, the jury 
will be instruct  —— will be instructed not to 
hold that against you.  
   
   Okay.  And —— and I trust that you  have 
—— now that the  State has finished its case and 
you had a chance to discuss what happened with 
your attorney, and based on that discussion, 
you have decided that you  are not going to 
testify on your behalf.  Is anybody threatening 
or forcing you this morning not to testify?  
 
Han:  (Through the interpreter) No. 
 
Court: The decision not to testify is yours and yours 
alone after you have discussed the  matter with 
your attorney.  
 
Han:  (Through the interpreter) Yes.  
 
130 Hawaiʻi at 85-86, 306 P.3d at 130 -31.  
      We concluded the transcript did not indicate that a true 
colloquy had occurred, as the court had merely advised Han of 
his rights without any discussion , exchange , or ascertainment 
that Han fully comprehended these rights.  See 130 Hawaiʻi at 89, 
306 P.3d at 134.  Thus, we determined that, under the totality 
of the circumstances, no valid on -the-record waiver was shown:  
With respect to the Tachibana  colloquy at the close of 
defendant’s case, first, the court did not ask Petitioner 
for appropriate responses to ensure that Petitioner 
understood the rights articulated, and second, the risk 
that Petitioner did not understood was exacerbated by the 
fact that Petitioner needed an interpreter during the 
proceedings.  Accordingly, a review of the court’s 
interactions with Petitioner with respect to the 
constitutional right to testify establishes that the court **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
15 
 did not obtain a valid on -the-record waiver of Pe titioner’s 
right to testify.  
 
130 Hawaiʻi at 93, 306 P.3d at 138 (footnote omitted).    
 Trial courts must ensure adequate protection of the 
constitutional rights of defendants who have limited  English 
proficien cy (“LEP”).  Our cases explain that the presence of 
this “salient fact” underscores  the importance of a court’s 
colloquy as a procedural safeguard of the defendant’s right to 
testify.10  Thus, this salient fact requires that a record show a 
“true colloquy ” occurred, which means a discussion and exchange 
between the court and the defendant sufficient to establish that 
the defendant truly understood the rights being waived.  Hence, 
in the in stant case, the issue is whether, “under the totality 
of the circumstances surrounding the case, taking into account 
the defendant’s background, experience , and conduct,” the record 
reflects that the district court carried out its “serious and 
weighty” responsibility of ensuring that Ernes’ s jury trial 
waiver was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent.  Gomez-Lobato, 
130 Hawaiʻi at 470, 479, 312 P.3d at 90 2, 911.   
 To repeat, this was the entirety of Ern es’s jury trial 
waiver colloquy:  
Court: Okay, good morning, Mr. Ernes.  
 
Ernes: (In English)  Good morning.  
 
10  The requirement of a true colloquy is not limited to situations in 
which the “salient fact” is a language barrier.  We have also recognized 
mental illness as a “salient fact.”  Han, 130 Hawaiʻi at 92, 306 P.3d at 137.   **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **

Court: I just received a waiver of jury trial 
form.  Did you sign it?  
 
Ernes: (Through the interpreter)  Yes.  
 
Court: Okay.  Did you review it with your 
attorney?  
 
Ernes: (Through the interpreter)  Yes.  
 
Court: Okay.  Did she explain to you what a jury 
trial is?  
 
Ernes: (In English)  Yes.  
 
Court: Okay.  For the record, a jury trial is 
where you have an opportunity to help 
select 12 people from the community.  The 
State needs to prove its case beyond a 
reasonable doubt to all 12 jurors, and 
all 12 jurors must agree before you can 
be found guilty.  Is that your 
understanding?  
 
Ernes: (Through the interpreter)  Yes.  
 
Court: Yes.  Okay.  Is you r mind clear today?  
 
Ernes: (In English)  Yes.  
 
Court: Okay, how much education do you have?  
High school?  College?  
 
Ernes: (In English)  No, just have high school.  
 
Court: High school?  Okay.  Do you understand 
your right to a jury trial?  
 
Ernes: (Through the interpreter)  Yes.  
 
Court: Yes.  Is anyone forcing you to give up 
this right?  
 
Ernes: (In English)  No.  
 
Court: All right, thank you.  Court will find 
defendant knowing, voluntary, 
(indiscernible) right to jury trial, 
enter a not guilty plea, request Chuukese 
interpreter next proceeding.  
 
 First, like the defendants in Duarte-Higareda and Gomez-
Lobato, Ernes executed a written jury trial waiver form.  While **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
17 
 Ernes indicated that he reviewed the form with counsel, the 
record does not indicate that the form was sight-translated into 
Chuukese for him.   
 Second, as in Duarte-Higareda , Gomez-Lobato, and Han, 
Ernes’s language barrier was  a “salient fact” known to th e 
court.  Even where a defendant executes a written waiver form, 
“the court should also engage in an oral colloquy with the 
defendant to establish that the waiver was knowing, intelligent, 
and voluntary.”  Gomez-Lobato, 130 Hawaiʻi at 469, 312 P.3d at 
901 (citations omitted) .  The language barrier elevated  the 
district  court’s obligation  to “conduct a colloquy . . . to 
carry out its ‘serious and weighty responsibility’ of ensuring 
that [his] jury waiver is voluntary, knowing, and in telligent.”   
Duarte-Higareda , 113 F.3d at 1003; Gomez-Lobato, 130 Hawaiʻi at 
471, 312 P.3d at 903; Han, 130 Hawaiʻi at 92, 306 P.3d at 137.   
Third, the exchange between the court and the defendant 
must be a “true colloquy, ” which is discussion and exchange 
between the trial court and the defendant sufficient for an  
ascertainment based on the record that the defendant fully 
comprehended the con stitutional rights being waived.  Han, 130 
Hawaiʻi at 90, 306 P.3d at 1 35.  When a language barrier is 
involved, such a discussion and exchange is required to fulfill 
a court’s responsibility.  **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
18 
 Applying these general principles to this case, o ther than 
confirming that Ernes had signed the jury trial waiver form, 
this was the entirety of the colloquy regarding Ernes’s 
understanding of his right to  a trial by jury:  
For the record, a jury trial is where you have an 
opportunity to help select 12 people from the community. 
The State needs to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt 
to all 12 jurors, and all 12 jurors must agree before you 
can be found to be guilty.  Is that your understanding?  
 
As indicated by t he district court ’s prefatory statement, the 
“exchange ” with Ernes was an advisement  “for the record ,” not a 
true colloquy , and was a confusing advisement at that.   The 
district court stated that “a jury trial is where [Ernes has] an 
opportunity to help sele ct 12 people from the community .”  
Although the district court went on to state that “[t]he State 
needs to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt to all 12 
jurors, and all 12 jurors must agree before you can be found 
guilty.  Is that your understanding?, ” conflating jury selection 
with a jury trial was confusing.11   
The district court also did not advise Ernes on the fourth 
Duarte-Higareda  aspect of a jury trial -- that “the court alone 
decides guilt or innocence if the defendant waives a jury 
trial.”  Duarte-Higareda , 113 F.3d at 1002.  Although a jury 
trial waiver may be valid despite a trial court’s failure to 
 
11  Thus, we disagree the dissent that the district court’s advisement was 
a “succinct and clear explanation of what a jury trial entails.”  
   **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **

 inform a defendant of certain aspect s of the right, the presence 
of a “salient fact” trigger s a trial court ’s obligation to 
conduct a more  comprehens ive colloquy that ascertains a  
defendant ’s understanding of the right they are waiving.   See 
Friedman , 93 Hawaiʻi at 70, 996 P.2d at 275 .  
Most countries, including the Federated States of 
Micronesia  (“the FSM”), do not have jury trials.  And most 
countries in the world have civil law traditions, as compared to 
our country as well as forty -nine of its states, including 
Hawaiʻi, which are based on common law traditions .12  In the 
United States, jury-waived bench  trials almost always involve 
one judge, who becomes the sole decisionmaker .  In civil law 
countries, however, although the number may vary by country , 
trial courts usually sit on panels of three judges.  See U.S. 
Dep’t of Justice Nat ’l Sec. Div., International Legal Systems  -- 
An Introduction 8.13  Thus, when a language barrier exists, this 
difference between a jury and bench trial is extremely 
important , and a trial court should ensure a defendant 
understands the difference .14

14  The dissent believes we assume Ernes’s language barrier signified a 
complete unfamiliarity with single -judge bench trials and points out that the 
FSM has one judge bench trials.  However, the record does not indicate Ernes **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
20 
  The lack of information on the record regarding Ernes ’s 
background and experience contributes to the insufficiency of 
the record to establish a valid waiver based on a totality of 
circumstances.  The “colloquy ” does not reflect any information 
regarding Ern es’s background, including his age, employment, how 
long he had been in the United States, whether he had received 
any schooling in the United States, or whether he had any 
familiarity or experience with jury trials.  The district court 
did ask Ernes whether his mind was clear and questioned him 
about his educational background.   Cf. Gomez-Lobato, 130 Hawaiʻi 
at 472, 312 P.3d at 904 (noting that nothing in the record 
indicated that Gomez -Lobato’s educational background could 
establish that he understood his right to a jury trial).  When 
probed about his educational background, however, Ernes 
responded , “No, just have high school.”  Although the dissent 
asserts that Ernes therefore “had a high school education ,” 
“just have high school ” does not indicate whether Ernes had 
graduated from high school and if he had attended high school in 
the United States.    
 The educational attainment of a defendant is obviously not 
controlling; a person with some high school could be quite 
 
(continued. . .) 
had any experience with trial s in the FSM; thus, the record does not indicate 
his understanding that if he waived his right to a jury trial, his case would 
be decided by one judge.  In addition, it cannot be assumed that an LEP 
person lived their entire life in the country of their na tive language.    **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
21 
 familiar with the jury trial process.   The educational level of 
a defendant  can, however, be part of the information base that 
might indic ate a further inquiry is in order : 
Thus, [State v. ] Dickson[, 4 Haw. App. 614, 673 P.2d 1036  
(1983) (holding that the record must indicate a defendant ’s 
voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver of 
counsel)]  indicates that a “trial court should 
first examine” the facts and circumstances particular to 
the defendant that will assist the court in assessing the 
defendant ’s level of comprehension . [4 Haw. App. at 619, 
673 P.2d at 1041.]  Once this initial inquiry is complete, 
the trial court may tailor its colloquy  with the defendant 
to ensure that the court adequately conveys the risks and 
disadvantages of self -representation in a manner that the 
defendant will be able to understand.  While courts are not 
required to strictly adhere to  Dickson’s analytical 
framework [for a waiver of counsel], it provides an 
important tool to ensure  waivers are made knowingly and 
intelligently in addition to establishing a complete record 
for appellate review . 
 
State v. Phua , 135 Hawaiʻi 504, 513, 353 P.3d 1046, 1055 (2015)  
(emphases added) .      
 The dissent recognizes that a language barrier is a salient 
fact that necessitates a colloquy.  It asserts, however,  that 
“Gomez-Lobato gave trial courts two examples of colloquies that 
would be sufficient :  (1) ask questions to ‘expressly confirm ’ 
Ernes understood ‘that he had a right to trial by jury and that 
he was waiving that right, ’ or (2) ask Ernes open -ended 
questions requiring more than a yes or no ans wer.  130 Hawaiʻi at 
472, 312 P.3d at 904. ”  In this case, the only response Ernes 
gave that was not “yes” or “no” was “just have high school .”  We 
disagree , however,  that Gomez-Lobato gave a trial court such a 
formulaic “choice.”  That case required that , for a challenged **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
22 
 waiver to be affirmed, the record contain a colloquy sufficient 
to show that a defendant truly understood the right he was 
waiving.     
 In Gomez-Lobato, this court therefore actually provided 
examples of additional steps that “[a trial] court should take  
. . . to ensure the defendant understands the right that [they 
are] waiving,” where “a language barrier indicates that [the] 
defendant’s written waiver executed outside the p resence of the 
judge ‘might be less than knowing and intelligent[.]’” Gomez-
Lobato, 130 Hawaiʻi at 472, 312 P.3d at 904.  In other words,  the 
dissent actually omits a critical part of the passage from 
Gomez-Lobato: 
For example, in the instant case, the court did not 
expressly confirm with Gomez –Lobato that he understood that 
he had a right to trial by jury and that he was waiving 
that right.  The court could have asked those questions, 
or, as Gomez –Lobato suggests, the court could have asked 
Gomez–Lobato what the document he signed meant to him, 
which would have required more than a yes or no answer and 
would have allowed the court to assess whether Gomez –
Lobato truly understood the right he was waiving.  
 
Id. (emphasis added ).   
 Thus, in effect, the dissent now seeks to limit Gomez-
Lobato, which did not create a formulaic approach to whether a 
valid waiver w as established on the record; that case  actually 
gave examples of the types of inquiries that could be made for 
appellate courts to be satisfied that, based on a totality of 
circumstances, a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver had 
been shown.   **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
23 
  As noted, Gomez-Lobato explicitly states that when a  
language barrier exists, active questions requiring more than 
“yes” or “no” responses can be helpful.  Active questions are 
encouraged in court proceedings to ascertain whether a defendant 
needs a court interpreter.  See this court ’s “Order Adopting the 
Policies for Interpreted Proceedings in the Courts of the State 
of Hawaiʻi,” at 2.15  In addition to the examples given in Gomez-
Lobato, other active inquiries, such as , “Could you tell me your 
understanding of a jury trial? ” or, “Could you tell me who will 
decide whether you are guilty or not guilty if I accept your 
waiver of jury trial?, ” also require more than a “yes” or “no” 
response from a LEP defendant.  Thus, active questions can help 
show whether a defendant truly understands the right being 
waived.   
 By raising examples of the kinds of inquiries that could 
have been helpful, we do not deign to set out questions that 
must be asked in each case involving a LEP defendant.16  Our case 
law has, however,  consistently required that the record reflect 
a “true colloquy ” establishing a voluntary, knowing, and

16  For example, a defendant with a language barrier could be a legal 
scholar from another country specializing in U.S. criminal procedure law 
charged with an offense while in Hawai ʻi to study U.S. jury trials.  
 **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
24 
 intelligent waiver of a constitutional right  based on a totality 
of circumstances , which must be apparent on the record on 
appellate review.  
 Thus, for an appellate court to conclude that there was a 
valid waiver of a defendant ’s constitutional right to jury 
trial, t he record must reflect a colloquy establishing a true 
understanding based on a totality of circumstances of the 
particular case.   Black’s Law Dictionary defines a “colloquy ” as 
“[a]ny formal discussion, such as an oral exchange between a 
judge . . . and a  . . . defendant in which the judge ascertains 
the defendant ’s understanding of the proceedings and of the 
defendant ’s rights. ”  Colloquy , Black’s Law Dictionary (11th ed. 
2019).   
 The dissent would rule that , because the district court 
perfunctorily explained “for the record ” “three things about 
what happens during a jury trial ” and Ernes responded “yes,” 
“no,” and “just have high school” to the district court ’s 
advisements,  the district court satisfied its “serious and 
weighty responsibility” to determine whether a knowing and 
intelligent waiver of Ernes’s constitutional right was  shown.  
We disagree.  A court’s responsibility is n ot satisfied with 
mere “for the record ” recitations.  The district court simply 
did not engage in a colloquy with Ernes sufficient to ascertain , 
based on the record , whether he truly understood the **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
25 
 constitutional right he was waiving .  Thus, the “for the record”  
recitations do not establish , based on a totalit y of 
circumstances , a knowing and intelligent waiver of Ernes ’s 
constitutional right to a jury trial.   See U.S. v. Shorty , 741 
F.3d 961, 966 (9th Cir. 2013).  
V.  Conclusion  
 Based on the foregoing, the ICA’s March 27,  2019 judgment 
on appeal and the district court’s June 8, 2017 judgment and 
notice of entry of j udgment are vacated, and the case is 
remanded to the district court for further proceedings  
consistent with this opinion .
