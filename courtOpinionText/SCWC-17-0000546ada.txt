OPINION OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J.  
  
I. Introduction  
 On June 9, 2014, Allan H. Abihai (“Abihai ”), who was 
serving a life term of imprisonment for multiple felonies 
committed in 1984, left the Laumaka Work Furlough Center 
(“Laumaka”) in Honolulu and did not return.  On June 29, 2014, 
Abihai was arrested at a former cellmate’s apartment in Electronically Filed

 Honolulu.  He was later charged with escape in the second 
degree. 
 In his jury trial on the escape charge, Abihai raised a 
choice of evils defense, contending he left Laumaka because he 
was threatened he would be hurt if he testified in an upcoming 
federal criminal trial involving a prison gang.  The jury was 
instructed on the choice of evils defense, then convicted Abihai 
of escape in the second degree.  The Circuit Court of the First 
Circuit (“circuit court”) imposed a five -year prison term for 
the escape convictio n, to run concurrent to his life sentence 
for the 1984 felonies, and denied him credit for time served.  
 Abihai raised two points of error on appeal to the ICA: (1) 
that trial counsel was ineffective for substantially impairing 
his choice of evils defense by failing to elicit certain 
testimony from his witnesses; and (2) that the circuit court 
erred when it denied him credit for time served on the sentence 
imposed for the escape conviction.  The ICA affirmed the circuit 
court’s judgment of conviction and se ntence.  
 Abihai raises the same issues  on certiorari.  For the 
reasons below, we resolve Abihai’s points of error as follows:  
(1) Because the record on appeal is insufficient to determine 
whether there has been ineffective assistance of counsel, we 
affirm Abihai’s conviction without prejudice to a subsequent 
Hawaiʻi Rules of Penal Procedure (“HRPP”) Rule 40 petition on the ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***

 ineffective assistance of counsel claim; and (2) the ICA erred 
in affirming the circuit court’s decision to deny Abihai credit 
for time served on his escape conviction.  The circuit court’s 
June 14, 2017 judgment of conviction and sentence is therefore 
affirmed, but the ICA’s September 6, 2018 judgment on appeal is 
vacated, and this matter is remanded to the circuit court for 
calculation  of Abihai’s presentence detention credit consistent 
with this opinion.  
II.  Background  
A.  Factual Background  
 On June 9, 2014, Abihai, serving a life sentence for 
multiple felony convictions, left Laumaka on a work furlough but 
did not return.  On June 29, 2014, Abihai was located at the 
apartment of a paroled former inmate and arrested for escape by 
deputy sheriffs from the Department of Public Safety (“DPS”).1  
An investigator in the Department of the Attorney General 
requested that DPS release Abihai  on the escape charge after 
booking and processing.   Abihai was then taken to the Sheriff 
Receiving Desk in Honolulu for booking and processing.  After 
midnight, Abihai was transported to the Oahu Community 
Correctional Center (“OCCC”); when Abihai complai ned of pain in 
 
1  DPS Incident Report #SD1404341 clearly states that Abihai was arrested 
for Escape in the Second Degree on June 29, 2014.

 his ribs, OCCC declined custody until Abihai was medically 
cleared.  At some point, Abihai was placed back into custody at 
Halawa Correctional Facility (“Halawa”) on his original 
sentence.  
B. Circuit Court Proceedings  
 On March 17, 2015, Ab ihai was charged by felony information 
with one count of escape in the second degree in violation of 
Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (“HRS”) § 710 -1021 (2014).2  On the same 
date, an arrest warrant on the escape charge issued on March 13, 
2015, which set bail at  $10,000, was executed on Abihai at 
Halawa and Abihai remained in custody at Halawa.  
A jury trial on the escape charge commenced in the circuit 
court on February 6, 2017.3  In opening statements, the State 
explained that in June 2014, Abihai was accepted into the Work 
Furlough Program at Laumaka, assigned a case manager, and signed 
a work furlough agreement.   The State further explained that the 
evidence would show that on June 9, 2014, Abihai intentionally 
escaped from Laumaka.   
 
2 HRS § 710 -1021 provides:  
 
 Escape in the second degree.   (1) A person commits 
the offense of escape in the second degree if th e person 
intentionally escapes from a correctional or detention 
facility or from custody.  
 (2)  Escape in the second degree is a class C felony.  
3 The Honorable Glenn J. Kim presided.  Abihai’s first jury trial ended 
in a mistrial on November 28, 2016.  ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***

  In Abihai’s opening statement, Abihai’s counsel did not 
dispute that Abihai had escaped; rather, he presented a choice 
of evils def ense and argued that , because Abihai was running for 
his life , he could not be guilty of escape.4  Specifically, 
Abihai’s counsel stated that Abihai’s  
life was in danger because members of a giant prison gang 
and a corrupt [adult corrections officer], his  former 
friend, Feso Malafau believed that he would be testifying 
in a federal case that was brought against those gang 
members and that prison guard.  They though he was going to 
be a snitch or a rat.  
 
Abihai’s counsel told the jury that the evidence woul d 
demonstrate that (1) Abihai was threatened; (2) his complaints 
to prison officials were not being addressed; (3) he did not 
have time to go to the courts to get transferred to a different 
location; and (4) he did not use force to escape.  Abihai’s 
 
4 The choice of evils defense to an escape charge is set out in        
HRS § 703 -302(3) (2014):  
 
 (3) In a prosecution for escape under section     
710-1020 or 710 -1021, the defense available under this 
section is limited to an affirmative defense consisting of 
the following elements:  
 (a) The actor receives a threat, express or 
implied, of death, substantial bodily injury, 
or forcible sexual attack;  
 (b) Complaint to the proper prison authorities is 
either impossible under the circumstances or 
there exists a history of futile complaints;  
 (c) Under the circumstances there is no time or 
opportunity to resort to the courts;  
 (d) No force or violence is used against prison 
personnel or other innocent persons; and 
(e) The actor promptly reports to the proper 
authorities when the actor has attained a 
position of safety from the immediate threat . 
 
(Emphasis added.)  
 ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***

 counsel conceded, however, that Abihai did not try to turn 
himself in:  
[Y]ou’re going to hear that he did not turn himself in.  
The State is correct.  He didn’t call and say, hey, come 
get me, pick me up.  It was his plan to wait.  He believed 
he could not be sa fe until the USO trial, win or lose, was 
over and they knew he wasn’t a snitch or a rat and he 
failed.  But that’s why he didn’t turn himself in.  
 
 According to the testimony of the State’s witnesses at 
trial, Abihai had escaped when he did not return to L aumaka 
after leaving the facility for a job on June 9, 2014.  Carolyne 
Papaliʻi (“Papaliʻi”), a social worker at Laumaka, testified that 
she knew Abihai and was his case manager.  Papaliʻi explained 
that she reviewed a work furlough agreement with Abihai i n March 
2014, and that he signed the agreement, which contained several 
provisions discussing the consequences should an inmate fail to 
return to Laumaka in a timely manner.  Papaliʻi testified that on 
June 9, 2014, Abihai was supposed to report to Beachsi de Roofing 
for work, and was supposed to return to Laumaka at 8:00 p.m.  
Papaliʻi further reported that she was told the following morning 
that Abihai did not return to Laumaka.   
 Adult Corrections Officer Benjamin Morn (“ACO Morn”) also 
testified that Ab ihai failed to return to Laumaka on June 9, 
2014.  ACO Morn stated that he had reported for duty for the 
midnight shift at Laumaka at 10:00 p.m. on June 9, 2014, and 
discovered that Abihai had not returned.  ACO Morn also ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    *** 
 
7 
 testified that he did not receive any call from Abihai reporting 
where he was or why he was late.  
 James Mahelona (“Mahelona”), the field representative for 
Beachside Roofing, testified that he knew Abihai and that on 
June 9, 2014, Abihai was supposed to show up for work.  Mahelona 
stated that Abihai did not show up to work and did not call to 
state that he was not going to show up.    
 To support his choice of evils defense, Abihai presented 
testimony from witnesses regarding his involvement in the 
federal criminal trial of the USO Family G ang,5 which began in 
September 2014.  
 Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Brady (“AUSA Brady”) 
testified that he approached Abihai in September 2014 to ask if 
he would testify against the USO Family Gang, specifically as to 
his relationship with an adult corre ctions officer at Halawa 
Correctional Facility, Feso Malafau (“ACO Malafau”).6  AUSA Brady 
stated that when Abihai expressed an intent to testify in the 
trial, the federal government took some precautions to keep him 
safe.  For example, Abihai was transfe rred to the Federal 
 
5 The USO Family Gang was a prison gang made u p of mostly, but not 
exclusively, Samoan inmates in state correctional facilities.   “USO stands 
for United Samoan Organization . . . but it’s also the Samoan word for 
brother.”   
6 In other words, AUSA Brady contacted Abihai after he escaped and was 
re-arrested in June 2014.   ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***

 Detention Center because “[w]e wanted to interview him again for 
his safety.  We did not want that to occur at Halawa.”  
 AUSA Brady testified, however, that on September 30, 2014, 
he was informed that Abihai had told the U.S. Marshals that he 
was unwilling to testify in the trial.  AUSA Brady stated that 
he then met Abihai for a short discussion.  On cross -
examination, AUSA Brady described their conversation:  
 [The State:] And what was his demeanor?  
 [AUSA Brady:] His demeanor was –- his demeanor was 
that he refused to come into the courtroom.  He said he did 
not want anyone to see his face.  But as he was telling me 
that he was smiling.  
 [The State:] He was smiling?  
 [AUSA Brady:] Yes.  
 [The State:] Did the defendant ever ask for federa l 
protection in exchange for his participation cooperating 
with the Feds?  
 [AUSA Brady:] No.  
 [The State:] If a potential witness like this 
defendant refused to cooperate with the federal government 
initially prior to trial are there any negative 
ramificat ions to that?  
 [AUSA Brady:] No, there’s nothing we could do if 
somebody refused to testify.  
    
 Abihai also called Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) 
Officer Lawrence Myers (“Officer Myers”).  Officer Myers 
testified he took precautions to ensure people did not know 
Abihai was speaking with federal investigators:  
 [Abihai’s Counsel:] And did you take precautions to 
protect Mr. Abihai from people either knowing about those 
interviews or knowing that he would testify?  
 [Officer Myers:] Yes, I did.  
 [Abihai’s Counsel:] Are you comfortable telling us 
the exact nature of those precautions?  
 [Officer Myers:]  No. 
 [Abihai’s Counsel:] Why not?  
 [Officer Myers:] Not in this open court.  It would 
endanger the lives of those that I took precautions to 
ensure their safety currently and those in the future.  ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    *** 
 
9 
  [Abihai’s Counsel:] So, for example, if you have a 
technique that hides the fact that someone might be a 
snitch or rat, you don’t want to tell the whole world what 
that technique is, correct?  
 [Officer Myers:] That is correct.  
 [Abihai’s Counsel:] That’s fine, I won’t ask you for 
more details.  
 
 Abihai also calle d Wendell Yoda (“Manager Yoda”), a 
supervisor at Laumaka, as a witness.  Manager Yoda stated that, 
before Abihai left Laumaka on June 9, 2014, Abihai never told 
him about any threats he had received at Laumaka.  Manager Yoda 
testified that, if Abihai wante d to contact him, he could do so 
by using the phone in the main administration building at 
Laumaka.  Manager Yoda could not remember whether Abihai had 
tried to call him in the days leading up to his escape, but he 
also explained that generally, if an inma te has a problem, it 
was the case manager’s responsibility to address the problem in 
the first instance.      
 Abihai also testified.  Abihai stated that, at some point 
after an indictment was filed against the USO Family and ACO 
Malafau, Abihai was approa ched by a USO member who threatened 
him should he testify in the trial:  
 [Abihai:] Someone came up to me said that you going 
get one –- Feso Malafau going be going court and that the 
Feds going be calling me for one witness because in 2010 I 
was investigat ed when I came back from my violation and 
they told me not to testify or say anything or else I going 
get rolled up.  
 [Abihai’s Counsel:] Now, at that point were you 
planning to testify or saying anything?  
 [Abihai:] At that moment, no.  
 [Abihai’s Counsel: ] Did you make any attempts to let 
USOs, Mr. Malafau, anybody know that you was going to keep 
quiet? 
 [Abihai:] Yes, I did.  ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    *** 
 
10 
  [Abihai’s Counsel:] What attempts did you make?  
 [Abihai:] I told that member I not going say nothing.  
And he said that if I do th ey going find out and then I 
going get rolled up.  
 
 Abihai also testified that security at Laumaka was lax, 
that it was easy to smuggle in contraband, and that the cameras 
in the facility did not work.  Abihai testified that he told 
Manager Yoda that it wa s important that he talk to him, and made 
two attempts to see him, but Manager Yoda did not see him.  
Abihai also stated that he told Officer Myers that he wanted to 
be transferred to Kulani Minimum Security Facility, because it 
was safer than Laumaka.  
 Abihai then explained what happened on June 9, 2014.  
Abihai stated that he did not show up to work and instead went 
to Rudy Nao’s apartment because he thought he would be safe 
there:  
[Abihai’s  Counsel:] And why did you go to Rudy [Nao]’s 
place? 
[Abihai:] Because he was in one security apartment and he 
was living on the ninth floor.  
 [Abihai’s Counsel:] Did you trust Mr. [Nao] not to 
harm you or turn you over to anybody who would harm you?  
 [Abihai:] Yeah, I trusted him.  
 [Abihai’s Counsel:] How long were you living with 
Rudy [Nao] before you got caught?  
 [Abihai:] I was living with him all the way until I 
got doubt [sic].  
 [Abihai’s Counsel:] How come you didn’t just call the 
cops after you walk ed away and said, hey, I took off, but I 
going turn myself in, just put me somewhere safe?  
 [Abihai:] I never trust nobody.  
 [Abihai’s Counsel:] Why not?  
 [Abihai:] Because in the past when I was younger they 
used to get bust me up.  
 [Abihai’s Counsel:] Yo u’re talking about cops?  
 [Abihai:] Yeah.  
 [Abihai’s Counsel:] And did –- you knew some ACOs who 
were involved like Malafau who were dirty right?  
 [Abihai:] Yeah.  ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    *** 
 
11 
  [Abihai’s Counsel:] Did you know them all?  
 [Abihai:] Yeah, I knew them all.  
 
 . . . . 
 
 [Abihai’s Counsel:] . . . [I]f you turn yourself in 
did you feel you had guarantees of your safety?  
 [Abihai:] No.  
 [Abihai’s Counsel:] What was your plan, why when you 
went to Rudy?  
 [Abihai:] I went to his place because I knew that I 
was going be –- be questioned by the Feds and IA again to 
testify against Feso Malafau.  
 [Abihai’s Counsel:] So let’s say they question you 
and you say I’m not going to talk, does that take the rat 
target off your back? . . . Let’s say you don’t, I mean, 
let’s say that what happ ened happened, they catch you in 
three weeks, okay.  You’re back in custody.  The Feds come 
to see you or take you out.  If people find out about that 
conversation, does it matter whether you said I’ll be a rat 
or I’m not going talk, does it matter, or do you always 
have the rat target?  
 [Abihai:] It matters.  
 [Abihai’s Counsel:] How are you going to tell people 
and prove to them I kept my mouth shut?  
 [Abihai:] Like I said, if I went stay long enough to 
stay out and the case was over I wouldn’t be able to 
testify against them.  
 
 Before closing arguments, the circuit court instructed the 
jury that Abihai had raised the affirmative defense of “choice 
of evils.”  It then stated that the defense consisted of five 
elements, which “the defendant must prove . . . by a 
preponderance of the evidence.  This means that the defendant 
must prove that it is more likely than not, or more probable 
than not, that each element o f ‘choice of evils’ occurred.”  The 
circuit court also instructed the jury that,  
[i]f you unanimously find that the defendant has not proven 
one or more of the elements of “choice of evils” by a 
preponderance of the evidence, then you must find the 
defendant guilty of Escape in the Second Degree.  [F]or any 
element which you decide the defendant has not proven by a 
preponderance of the evidence, your vote must be unanimous 
on that element.  ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    *** 
 
12 
  If you are unable to reach a unanimous agreement as 
to whether “cho ice of evils” has been proved or not been 
proved, then a verdict may not be returned on Escape in the 
Second Degree.  
 
   In closing arguments, the State argued that Abihai had 
failed to provide evidence that he met the fifth element of the 
choice of evils defense:7 
 When you look at element No. 5, did he promptly 
report to the proper authorities when he obtained a 
position of safety from the immediate threat?  He didn’t 
call HPD.  He didn’t call the sheriffs.  He didn’t call 
[Papali ʻi].  He didn’t call Lau maka at all as you heard from 
Officer Morn . . . . He didn’t call [Manager Yoda].  You 
know, he didn’t even call Mr. Mahelona.  If by a stretch 
you could deem him a proper authority.  He didn’t call any 
of these authorities let alone promptly.  
 
Abihai’s counsel stated that it was “tough” for them to meet the 
fifth element of the choice of evils defense because “he never 
turned himself in.  They had to catch him.”  On February 9, 
2017, the jury returned a guilty verdict on Abihai’s escape in 
the second degree charge.  
 The circuit court held a sentencing hearing on June 14, 
2017.  DPS had submitted a certificate of detention regarding 
Abihai’s presentence detention8 indicating 1032 days of credit 
 
7 See note 4, supra. 
8  DPS’s Corrections Administration Policy and Procedures Policy No. 
Cor.05.01 effective December 2, 2009 concerns “Certificate of Pre -Sentence 
Credits,” and states its “Purpose” under section 1.0 as follows:  
 
To implement the statutory requirements set forth in     
[HRS §] 706 -[671], in a consistent and timely manner.  The 
statute requires that all time spent in custody in relation 
to the charge on which a defendant is sentenced shall be 
credited towar d that sentence as pre -sentence credit.  
Furthermore, the party having custody of the defendant 
shall supply a certificate indicating all the pre -sentence 
credit, to the court prior to sentencing.  ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    *** 
 
13 
 from Abihai’s June 29, 2014 arrest until April 25, 2 017.9  
Abihai’s counsel indicated Abihai would be appealing his 
conviction and would not be addressing the court, and requested 
that Abihai’s prison term be made to run concurrently with the 
sentence he was already serving, with credit for time served.  
The State requested that Abihai be sentenced to a five -year term 
for the escape conviction, to be imposed consecutive to his 
existing life sentence.  
The circuit court then ordered that Abihai’s five -year 
sentence be served concurrent to his life sentence, a nd that he 
receive credit for time served.  In response, the State argued 
that Abihai was not entitled to be given credit for time served 
before his conviction.   The circuit court then ordered further 
briefing.  
 Right after the June 14, 2017 hearing, the c ircuit court 
entered a judgment of conviction and sentence, attaching the DPS 
certificates of detention  along with a mittimus committing 
Abihai to the custody of DPS.  
 The State then filed a memorandum regarding presentence 
detention credit on June 19, 20 17, and Abihai filed a responsive 
memorandum on June 25, 2017.   The circuit court then conducted 
 
 
9  DPS also submitted another certificate for one day of c redit for April 
8, 2015, but this date is apparently included in the first certificate.   
  ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    *** 
 
14 
 a further sentencing hearing on June 28, 2017.  The circuit 
court agreed with the State, ruling that based on the plain 
language of HRS § 706 -671(3) (2014), A bihai was not entitled to 
presentence detention credit.   The circuit court ordered that 
Abihai be given credit only from the June 14, 2017 sentencing 
date. 
C. ICA Proceedings  
 On July 12, 2017, Abihai filed a notice of appeal.  
Abihai’s opening brief alleg ed two points of error:   (1) that 
trial counsel was ineffective for substantially impairing 
Abihai’s choice of evils defense; and (2) that the circuit court 
misconstrued HRS § 706 -671 when it denied Abihai credit for time 
served before sentencing.    
 The ICA entered a SDO on July 19, 2018 which affirmed the 
circuit court’s judgment of conviction and sentence.  State v. 
Abihai, CAAP-17-0000546 (App. July 19, 2018) (SDO).  Regarding 
Abihai’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the ICA first 
noted th at under State v. Wakisaka , 102 Hawaiʻi 504, 513 -14, 78 
P.3d 317, 326 -27 (2003),  
[t]he defendant has the burden of establishing ineffective 
assistance of counsel and must meet the following two part 
test: 1) that there were specific errors or omissions 
reflecting counsel’s lack of skill, judgment, or diligence; 
and 2) that such errors or omissions resulted in either the 
withdrawal or substantial impairment of a potentially 
meritorious defense.  
 ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    *** 
 
15 
 Abihai, SDO at 2.   The ICA concluded Abihai could not 
demonstra te that any alleged errors or omissions of his trial 
counsel resulted in the withdrawal or substantial impairment of 
a potentially meritorious defense.  Abihai, SDO at 3 -4.  The ICA 
noted that in a choice of evils defense involving escape, five 
elements must be proven.10  Abihai, SDO at 4.   The ICA stated 
that because there was no evidence in the record regarding one 
of the elements, that Abihai promptly reported to the proper 
authorities when he had attained a position of safety from the 
immediate threat after escaping Laumaka, Abihai could not prove 
the requisite fifth element of the choice of evils defense.  Id.  
Therefore, the ICA concluded that Abihai failed to establish 
that his trial counsel was ineffective.  Id.   
 Regarding credit for ti me served, the ICA concluded that 
under the plain language of HRS § 706 -671(3), because Abihai had 
been serving a life term of imprisonment for his unrelated 
felony conviction prior to escaping Laumaka, “[a]fter being 
taken back into custody on June 29, 20 14, Abihai continued to 
serve time on his life imprisonment sentence for his prior 
felony convictions unrelated to his escape conviction.”  Abihai, 
SDO at 5.  Therefore, the ICA determined that the circuit court 
did not err in denying credit for Abihai’s t ime served from June 
 
10 See note 4, supra. ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    *** 
 
16 
 29, 2014 (the date he was returned to custody) to June 14, 2017 
(the date he was sentenced for the escape conviction) for his 
subsequent escape conviction.  Id.   
 The ICA entered its judgment on appeal on September 6, 
2018.   
III.  Standards of Review  
A. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel  
 The burden of establishing ineffective assistance of 
counsel rests upon the appellant.  His burden is twofold: 
First, the appellant must establish specific errors or 
omissions of defense counsel refle cting counsel’s lack of 
skill, judgment or diligence.  Second, the appellant must 
establish that these errors or omissions resulted in either 
the withdrawal or substantial impairment of a potentially 
meritorious defense.  
 
State v. Antone , 62 Haw. 346, 348 -49, 615 P.2d 101, 104 (1980) 
(citations and footnote omitted).  
 In evaluating whether defense counsel’s omission deprived a 
defendant of a potentially meritorious defense, this court 
considers “the possible, rather than the probable, effect” of 
the error.  Maddox v. State , 141 Hawaiʻi 196, 205, 407 P.3d 152, 
161 (2017) (quoting Wilton v. State , 116 Hawaiʻi 106, 119, 170 
P.3d 357, 370 (2007)).  
B. Statutory Interpretation  
 Statutory interpretation is a question of law reviewable  de 
novo.  When construing statutes, the court is governed by the 
following rules:  
 First, the fundamental starting point for statutory 
interpretation is the language of the statute itself.   ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    *** 
 
17 
 Second, where the statutory language is plain and 
unambiguous, our sole duty is t o give effect to its plain 
and obvious meaning.  Third, implicit in the task of 
statutory construction is our foremost obligation to 
ascertain and give effect to the intention of the 
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the 
language containe d in the statute itself.  Fourth, when 
there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness 
or uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, an 
ambiguity exists.  
 When there is ambiguity in a statute, the meaning of 
the ambiguous words may be soug ht by examining the context, 
with which the ambiguous words, phrases, and sentences may 
be compared, in order to ascertain their true meaning. 
Moreover, the courts may resort to extrinsic aids in 
determining legislative intent, such as legislative 
history,  or the reason and spirit of the law.

citation s omitted).  
IV.  Discussion  
 Abihai presents tw o questions on certiorari:   (1) whether 
the ICA erred in finding that his trial counsel was not 
ineffective; and (2) whether the ICA erred when it concluded 
that HRS § 706 -671 did not require the circuit court to give him 
pretrial detention credit from his  June 29, 2014 arrest to June 
14, 2017.  The two questions are discussed in turn.  
A. We affirm Abihai’s conviction without prejudice to a 
subsequent Hawaiʻi Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 40 petition 
with respect to his ineffective assistance of counsel claim  
 
 With respect to the first question on certiorari, Abihai 
argues that his trial counsel was ineffective.  He alleges trial 
counsel failed to do three sp ecific things that led to a 
substantial impairment of Abihai’s choice of evils defense:   (1) ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    *** 
 
18 
 question the federal officers about Abihai’s request to be 
transferred; (2) question Officer Myers about the safety 
procedures and precautions he took to protect A bihai; and (3) 
point out that it was Abihai’s potential testimony against an 
adult corrections officer, not against the USO family gang, that 
posed a significant danger to Abihai.  
 The ICA rejected Abihai’s ineffective assistance claim on 
the grounds that there was no evidence regarding the fifth 
element of the choice of evils defense, which required that he 
“promptly report[] to the proper authorities when [he] ha[d] 
attained a position of safety from the [alleged] immediate 
threat.”  HRS § 703 -302(3) sets  out the choice of evils defense 
to a prosecution for escape under HRS § 710 -1021, and provides;  
Choice of evils.    
. . . . 
(3) In a prosecution for escape under section 710 -1020 or 
710-1021, the defense available under this section is 
limited to an affirm ative defense consisting of the 
following elements:  
 (a) The actor receives a threat, express or 
implied, of death, substantial bodily injury, 
or forcible sexual attack;  
 (b) Complaint to the proper prison authorities is 
either impossible under the circums tances or 
there exists a history of futile complaints;  
 (c) Under the circumstances there is no time or 
opportunity to resort to the courts;  
 (d) No force or violence is used against prison 
personnel or other innocent persons; and 
 (e) The actor promptly r eports to the proper 
authorities when the actor has attained a 
position of safety from the immediate threat . 
 
HRS § 703 -302(3) (emphasis added).  Pursuant to HRS § 701-115(2) 
(2014), “[n]o defense may be considered by the trier of  fact ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    *** 
 
19 
 unless evidence of t he specified fact or facts has been 
presented . . . .”   
 The ICA erred in ruling that there was no evidence of the 
fifth element.  Abihai did not testify that when he arrived at 
the paroled inmate’s apartment, he believed it to be safe.  
Rather, when aske d whether he felt he “had guarantees of . . . 
safety” after arriving at the apartment, he responded in the 
negative.  He also testified that he thought he needed to “stay 
[there] long enough . . . and the case [would be] over [and] I 
wouldn’t be able to te stify against them.”  The circuit court 
would have had no basis for instructing the jury on the choice 
of evils defense if there had been no evidence of the fifth 
element.  Thus, the ICA erred in ruling on Abihai’s ineffective 
assistance of counsel claim o n the basis  that there was no 
evidence of the fifth element.   
 With respect to a defendant’s assertion of ineffective 
assistance of counsel on a direct appeal, we have held:  
[No]t every trial record is sufficiently developed to 
determine whether there has  been ineffective assistance of 
counsel; indeed, a defendant is often only able to allege 
facts that, if proved, would entitle [them]11 to relief. 
Therefore, we hold that where the record on appeal is 
insufficient to demonstrate ineffective assistance of 
counsel, but where: (1) the defendant alleges facts that if 
proven would entitle [them] to relief, and (2) the claim is 
not patently fri volous and without trace of support in the 
record, the appellate court may affirm defendant ’s 
conviction without prejudice to a subsequent  Rule 40 
petition on the ineffective assistance of counsel claim.

gender identity of a person referred to is unknown  or immaterial; or (2)  
those are the pronouns of a specific person . ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***

State v. Silva , 75 Hawaiʻi 419, 439, 864 P.2d 583, 592 -93 
(1993) (footnote omitted).  
 In this case, the record on appeal is insufficient to 
determine whether there has been ineffective assistance of 
counsel.  We therefore affirm Abihai’s conviction, but 
without prejudice to a subs equent Rule 40 petition on the 
ineffective assistance of counsel claim.    
B. The circuit court erred in denying Abihai credit for time 
 served on his subsequent escape conviction, not from      
 June 14, 2017, but from March 17, 2015, when bail was set 
 on the escape charge  
 
 Abihai’s second question on certiorari requires us to 
interpret HRS § 706-671 subsections (1) and (3) (2014), which 
provide as follows:   
Credit for time of detention prior to sentence; credit for 
imprisonment under earlier sentence f or same 
crime.  (1)  When a defendant who is sentenced to 
imprisonment has previously been detained in any State or 
local correctional or other institution following the 
defendant ’s arrest for the crime for which sentence is 
imposed, such period of detenti on following the defendant ’s 
arrest shall be deducted from the minimum and maximum terms 
of such sentence .  The officer having custody of the 
defendant shall furnish a certificate to the court at the 
time of sentence, showing the length of such detention o f 
the defendant prior to sentence in any State or local 
correctional or other institution, and the certificate 
shall be annexed to the official records of the defendant’s 
commitment.  
 
. . . . 
 
(3)  Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, when a 
defendant is convicted for a crime committed while serving 
a sentence of imprisonment on a separate unrelated felony 
conviction, credit for time being served for the term of 
imprisonment imposed on the defendant for the separate 
unrelated felony conviction sh all not be deducted from the 
term of imprisonment imposed on the defendant for the 
subsequent conviction.  ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    *** 
 
21 
  
 Abihai argues that credit for time served is mandatory 
under HRS § 706 -671(1).  Abihai argues that, pursuant to 
subsection (1), he is entitled to pr esentence detention credit 
for 1082 days for the time period from June 29, 2014, when he 
was initially arrested for escape, until June 14, 2017, his 
sentencing date.12  The State asserts Abihai is not entitled to 
any presentence detention credit based on HRS § 706 -671(3), 
which was added by the legislature in 2012.  The circuit court 
and ICA agreed with the State.  
 We apply the rules of statutory interpretation to the 
parties’ competing arguments.  First, the fundamental starting 
point for statutory interpretation is the language of the 
statute itself.  Second, where the statutory language is plain 
and unambiguous, o ur sole duty is to give effect to its plain 
and obvious meaning.   
1.  Application of the plain langu age of HRS § 706 -671(1)  
 to Abihai ’s case 
 
 We first address HRS § 706 -671(1).  Based on its plain 
language, a person is entitled to presentence detention credit 
if (1) the person is a defendant (2) sentenced to imprisonment  
(3) who had previously been detained in a State institution (4) 
following t he person’s arrest  (5) for the crime for which 
sentence was imposed . 
 
12  We have not determined if this calculation is correct.   ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    *** 
 
22 
  Abihai claims credit from his June 29, 2014 arrest until 
his June 14, 2017 sentencing based on HRS § 706 -671(1).  Abihai 
clearly meets factors (1), (2), (3), and (4).  With respect to 
factor (5), however, the record reveals that Abihai was released 
on his own recognizance on the escape charge after his June 29, 
2014 arrest until March 17, 2015, when he was charged for escape 
and rearrested on the escape charge, with bail set at $10,000.  
In other words, after his June 29, 2014 arrest, and until his 
March 17, 2015 rearrest on the escape charge with bail set at 
$10,000, Abihai was held in custody in Halawa only on his 
previous sentence for the other unrelated felony convictions.  
Thus, from June 29, 2014 until March 17, 2015, Abihai was not 
being detained “for the crime for which [the escape] sentence 
[was] imposed.”  Therefore, HRS § 706 -671(1) does not entitle 
Abihai to presentence detention credit for the entire time he 
claims.  
 From Marc h 17, 2015 until the June 14, 2017 sentencing 
date, however, Abihai was held to answer on the escape charge, 
with bail set at $10,000.  See State v. Visintin , 143 Hawaiʻi 
143, 146, 426 P.3d 367, 370 (2018).  Thus, according to       
HRS § 706 -671(1), Abihai is entitled to presentence detention 
credit.13  
 
13  It is unclear how long Abihai was held, after his June 29, 2014  arrest 
until he was released on his own recognizance pending investigation, until he 
was charged with escape on March 17, 2015.   ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    *** 
 
23 
  The issue we must address is, however, whether, as 
concluded by the circuit court and ICA, the plain and 
unambiguous l anguage of HRS § 706 -671(3) eliminated Abihai’s 
entitlement to presentence detention credit under             
HRS § 706 -671(3).   
 2. Application of the plain language of HRS §  706-671(3) 
  to Abihai ’s case 
 
According to the plain language of the third sub section of 
HRS § 706 -671, (1) notwithstanding any other law to the 
contrary, (2) when a defendant (3) is convicted for a crime 
committed (4) while serving a sentence of imprisonment on a 
separate unrelated felony conviction, (5) credit for time being 
served for the separate unrelated felony conviction (6) shall 
not be deducted from the term of imprisonment imposed on the 
defendant for the subsequent conviction.   
In applying HRS § 706 -671(3) to Abihai, it is necessary to 
first determine whether factors (2) through (6) would eliminate 
Abihai’s entitlement to presentence detention credit under    
HRS § 706 -671(1).  If so, then HRS § 706 -671(1) would be an 
“other law to the contrary” to HRS § 706 -671(3) under factor 
(1), nullifying Abihai’s entitlement to credi t for time served 
under HRS § 706 -671(1). 
The circuit court and ICA reached the conclusion that 
Abihai is not entitled to presentence detention credit based on ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    *** 
 
24 
 the plain language of HRS § 706 -671(3).  We disagree.  The plain 
language of HRS § 706 -671(3) do es not eliminate Abihai’s 
entitlement to presentence detention credit pursuant to       
HRS § 706 -671(1).   
Although factors (2) through (4) of HRS § 706 -671(3) are 
met because (2) Abihai (3) was convicted for a crime committed 
(4) while serving a sentence  of imprisonment on a separate 
unrelated felony conviction, the critical factor is factor (5), 
and whether the presentence detention credit time Abihai 
requests is “time being served for the separate unrelated felony 
conviction.”  The answer is no.  The ti me Abihai was serving 
from March 17, 2015 to June 14, 2017 was not just “time being 
served for the separate unrelated felony conviction” but was 
also “time being served for the escape.”  Thus, Abihai was not 
requesting that factor (5) “time being served fo r the separate 
unrelated felony conviction” “be deducted from the term of 
imprisonment imposed on [him] for the subsequent [escape] 
conviction.”  
Therefore, neither factors (5) nor (6) were triggered.  
Accordingly, in this specific situation, HRS § 706 -671(1) is not 
an “other law to the contrary” to HRS § 706 -671(3) under factor 
(1).14  
 
14  If bail had not been set and Abihai  had been released on his own 
recognizance pending trial and sentencing, then HRS § 706 -671(3) would have 
been triggered, because Abihai would not have been entitled to presentence ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    *** 
 
25 
 As noted, the fundamental starting point for statutory 
interpretation is the language of the statute itself and , where 
the statutory language is plain and unambiguous, our sole duty 
is to give effect to its plain and obvious meaning.  Based on 
its plain and unambiguous language, HRS § 706 -671(3) was not 
triggered in this situation.  Further, due to the plain and 
unambiguous language of HRS § 706 -671 subsections (1) and (3), 
it is not necessary or appropriate to resort to principles of 
statutory interpretation applicable to ambiguous statutes.   
The dissent misstates our analysis by asserting that our 
“interpretation that [HRS] § 706 -671(1) entitles Abihai to pre -
sentence dete ntion credit creates a new rule [and] disregards 
our precedent . . . .”   It is actually the  dissent that would 
overrule precedent by ignoring this jurisdiction’s consistent 
holdings that a defendant is entitled to credit for time served 
in connection with the offense for which he is being sentenced. 
The dissent cites to State v. Miller , 79 Hawaiʻi 194, 197, 900 
P.2d 770, 773 (1995), State v. Kami , 71 Haw. 612, 801 P.2d 1206 
(1990), and State v. Yamasaki , 91 Hawaiʻi 163, 164, 981 P.2d 720, 
721 (App. 1999), as supportive of its position.  None of these 
cases, however, eliminated the fundamental req uirement under   
 
detention credit for the escape conviction pursuant to HRS § 706 -671(1).  W e 
also note that the circuit court sentenced Abihai to serve his five -year term 
for escape concurrently with his life sentence for his previous felonies.  
 ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    *** 
 
26 
 HRS § 706 -671(1) that a defendant be given presentence detention 
credit when “ detained in any State or local correctional or 
other institution following the defendant’s arrest for the crime 
for which sentence is imposed [.]”  The defendants  in these cases 
cited by dissent were not entitled to presentence detention 
credit because they were not so detained.15 
Moreover, State v. Tauiliili , 96 Hawaiʻi 195, 29 P.3d 914 
(2001), also cited to by the dissent, with State v. Garcia , 125 
Hawaiʻi 429, 263 P.3d 709 (2010), in accord, actually supports 
Abihai’s position.  Tauiliili  held that a defendant is entitled 
to presentence detention credit on each of the cases for which a 
defendant is sentenced to concurrent sentences.  96 Hawaiʻi at 
199, 29 P.3d a t 918.  As noted, the circuit court sentenced 
Abihai to serve his five -year sentence for the escape conviction 
 
15 In Miller, this court held the defendant was not entitled to credit for 
time served on a new char ge because his “probation [on the previous burglary 
conviction] had not been revoked when he was incarcerated on the separate 
charge of second degree robbery that ultimately led to his conviction[,]” and 
that “[t]hus, with respect to [his] newly imposed se ntence for his earlier 
burglary conviction, the circuit court properly denied him credit for time 
served after his arrest for the subsequent offense.”  79 Hawaiʻi at 197, 900 
P.2d at 773.  Likewise, Kami held that “because probation was not revoked nor 
a new sentence imposed . . . , no new sentence existed for which Defendant 
could receive credit for the time he had served . . . .”  71 Haw. at 615, 801 
P.2d at 1208.  In Yamasaki , the ICA “conclude[d] that [HRS] § 706 -671(1)     
. . . does not afford a defen dant the right to credit against the sentence 
imposed . . . for a criminal conviction the time that the defendant spent in 
prison, post -arrest and pre -sentence, as a consequence of a different 
criminal charge and/or conviction.”  91 Hawaiʻi at 164, 981 P.2 d at 721.  
Thus, these cases are clearly distinguishable on their facts, and do not 
affect Abihai’s entitlement to presentence detention credit pursuant to    
HRS § 706 -671 from March 17, 2015, when he was arrested and held on the 
escape charge.   
 ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    *** 
 
27 
 concurrently with his life sentence for his previous 
convictions.    
The Model Penal Code and Commentaries § 7.09 at 306 -07 
(Official Draft and R evised Comments 1985)(“MPC”), cited to by 
the dissent, which the ICA noted was the model for HRS § 706 -671 
in Yamasaki , 91 Hawaiʻi at 165, 981 P.2d at 722, also supports 
Abihai’s  position.  As the dissent notes, the Explanatory Note 
to MPC § 7.09(1) states, “[s]ubsection (1) establishes the 
defendant’s right to credit against his ultimate sentence for 
time served prior to the imposition of the sentence as a result 
of the same crim inal charge.”   
Abihai was charged with and arrested for the escape charge 
on March 17, 2015 with bail set at $10,000 on the same date, 
which remained unposted.  We have made it clear that Abihai is 
not entitled to credit for time served from June 29, 2014 , when 
he was taken into custody on the original sentence on the 
unrelated charges until his March 17, 2015 charge, arrest, and 
setting of bail on the escape charge.  Abihai remained in 
custody on the escape charge, however, from March 17, 2015 until 
he was sentenced on the same escape charge on June 14, 2017.  
Pursuant to the plain language of HRS § 706 -671, our case law, 
and the MPC’s Explanatory Note, Abihai is entitled to credit to 
time served from March 17, 2015 until June 14, 2017,  as 
presentence time  served in connection with the offense for which ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    *** 
 
28 
 the defendant is being sentenced and as “credit against his 
ultimate sentence for time served prior to the imposition of the 
sentence as a result of the same criminal charge.”     
Finally, although we conclude there is no ambiguity in the 
statutory language, even if an ambiguity existed, the rule of 
lenity would require this court to construe HRS § 706 -671 
strictly, and in favor of the defendant.   See State v. Bayly , 
118 Hawaiʻi 1, 15, 185 P.3d 186, 200 (2008) (“[W]here a criminal 
statute is ambiguous, it is to be interpreted according to the 
rule of lenity.  Under the rule of lenity, the statute must be 
strictly construed against the government and in favor of the 
accused.”) (citati on omitted).16    
V.  Conclusion  
 Based on the foregoing, the circuit court’s June 14, 2017 
judgment of conviction and sentence is affirmed, but the ICA’s 
September 6, 2018 judgment on appeal is vacated, and this matter 
is remanded to the circuit court for calculation of Abihai’s 
presenten ce detention credit consistent with this opinion.17

16  We also note that, in this case, denial of presentence detention credit 
would in effect have punished Abihai for exercising his constitutional right 
to a jury trial of his peers, as his first trial ended in a mistrial on 
November 28, 2016, extending the time of his pretrial detention.
