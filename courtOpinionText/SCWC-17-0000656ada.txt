OPINION OF THE COURT BY POLLACK, J. 
 
  Our caselaw has established that a search warrant for 
a multiple-occupancy building must describe with particularity 
each unit to be searched so as to preclude the indiscriminate 
search of one or more subunits.

moved to suppress evidence gathered from a search of his Electronically Filed

 residence asserting that the search warrant did not state with 
specificity the subunit he resided in.   
  The circuit court determined that the searched 
building was a multiple -occupancy building and that the affiant 
officer knew or should have known that the defendant’s subunit 
was a separate unit.  The search warrant did not describe the 
defendant’s subunit with particularity, the court concluded, and 
thus the search violated the defendant’s constitutional rights.  
The court granted the defendant’s motion to suppress in an order  
that included detailed findings of facts and conclusions of law.   
 
 The State appealed the order.  The Intermediate Court 
of Appeals (ICA) disagreed with the circuit court’s finding that 
the building was a multiple -occupancy building and held that the 
court erred in granting the defendant’s motion to suppress.   
Based upon our precedent as to findings of facts 
unchallenged on appeal and our law involving multiple-occupancy 
buildings, we conclude 
that the ICA erred and accordingly vacate 
the ICA’s Judgment  on Appeal and remand the case for further 
proceedings consistent with this opinion.

A. The Investigation and Warrant 
  
On May 11, 2017, Officer Marco Segobia of the Hawai i 
Police Department submitted an Affidavit f or Search Warrant 
(Affidavit) to the District Court of the Third Circuit (district 
court).  The Affidavit included the following statements
.  
Officer Segobia received information from a confidential 
informant (CI) who claimed to have observed Rodrigues sell 
methamphetamine multiple times in exchange for U.S. currency
.  
At the direction of Officer Segobia, t he CI conducted a 
controlled purchase of methamphetam ine from Rodrigues’ residence 
                                                                 
(. . . continued)

 located at the North West corner of the intersection of Konalani 
Street and Puuhalo Street.  The residence was a two story light 
colored wood siding structure with a white colored rooftop.  
Officer Segobia maintained constant surveillance as the CI 
walked to, entered, and exited the residence.  The CI turned 
over a zip packet, containing an unspecified amount of clear 
crystal substance that obtained a presumptive positive result 
for methamphetamine after Officer Segobia tested it. 
 
  T he Affidavit requested to search the following 
location: 
A residence located within the County and State of Hawai i 
and within the District of Kona.  Your affiant describes 
the residence as a three bedroom, 2 bathroom residence that 
[is] light colored, [and] has a white colored rooftop.  The 
residence is located at 
[] Puuhalo Street in Kailua -Kona, 
Hawaii.  Your affiant checked the Hawai i County Property 
Tax website and located the residence, which is owned by 
Yolanda M. RODRIGUES of address [] Puuhalo Street, Kailua -
Kona, Hawai i 96740. . . .  To include but not limited to 
all rooms, and other parts therein, the patio or lanai of 
such unit, and any attached garages and carport, attached 
storage rooms, garbage cans and containers located 
within[.]  
  
The district court issued a search warrant authorizing  
the search of the residence and property as described in the 
Affidavit.  The warrant authorized the search for 
methamphetamine, drug related paraphernalia, articles tending to 
show the sale, proceeds of sale, or transport of 
methamphetamine, articles tending to establish who controlled ***FOR PUBLICATION IN  WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 the premise, and U.S. currency with or near a controlled 
substance.6   
B. Circuit Court Proceedings 
  Rodrigues filed a Motion to Suppress Evidence a nd for 
Return of Property (Motion) in which he requested the 
suppression of “all evidence obtained as a result of the search 
of the ohana studio dwelling unit, in violation of [his
] 
constitutional rights under Article I” of the Hawai i 
Constitution.   
  
In his Motion, Rodrigues  argued that the warrant 
defined the main residence with particularity, but failed to 
mention the separate and distinct ohana unit that the police 
actually searched.7  Thus, there was no probable cause to search 
his ohana dwelling unit, Rodrigues contended,  because a search 
warrant for a “multiple -occupancy building” must describe with 
particularity the specific subunit to be searched to be valid.  
Alternatively, Rodrigues maintained that if the warrant did 
authorize a search of his subunit, it was overbroad.  Rodrigues 
                     
 6 The inventory filed with the district court after the search 
indicated that the officers seized, inter alia, 131.4 grams of crystal 
methamphetamine, 93.4 grams of cocaine, 33.4 grams of marijuana, various 
pills and drug paraphernalia, three vehicles, and $993 in cash.  
 7 “‘Ohana dwelling’ means a second dwelling unit permitted to be 
built as a separate or an attached unit on a building site, but does not 
include a guest house or a farm dwellin g.”  Hawai i County Code 1983,  ch. 25, 
§ 25-1-5 (b) (republished  2005).   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN  WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
7 
 also sought the return of his seized vehicles and cash under 
Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 41(e).8 
  In opposition, the State argued that the warrant 
satisfied the particularity requirement and that the search did 
not exceed the scope of the warrant.  The State acknowledged the 
general rule that a warrant for a multiple-occupancy building 
will usually be held invalid if it fails to describe the 
particular subunit
.  However, the State maintained that there is 
an exception when (1) the building appears to be a single-
occupancy building and (2) the affiant, investigating officers, 
and executing officers neither knew 
nor had reason to know that 
it was a multiple-occupancy building until the execution of the 
warrant was ongoing.  Based on the information available to 
Officer Segobia at the time that the warrant was issued, the 
scope of the search warrant did not preclude him from searching 
Rodrigues’  residence, the State argued, because it appeared that 
all occupants had access to the entirety of the building, making 
it a single-occupancy residence.   
                     
 8 HRPP Rule 41 (201 3) provides in pertinent part:  
 
(e) Motion to return property.  A person aggrieved by an 
unlawful search and seizure of property or by the 
deprivation of property may move the court having 
jurisdiction to try the offense for the return of the 
property.  The judge shall receive evidence on any issue of 
fact necessary to the decision of the motion. If the motion 
is granted, the property shall be returned unless otherwise 
subject to lawful detention, but the judge may impose 
reasonable conditions to protect access to the property and 
its use in later proceedings.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN  WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
8 
   Next, the State argued that the execution of the 
search warrant was valid and did not exceed the scope of the 
warrant.  The State asserted it was reasonable to search the 
entire dwelling described in the warrant because the search was 
conducted prior to discovery of the fact that Rodrigues’ unit 
was a separate unit.  Thus, according to the State, the search 
was valid as there was not objectively verifiable evidence from 
which the police officers should have unequivocally recognized 
that 
Rodrigues’ unit required a separate warrant. 
  
At the hearing on the Motion, Rodrigues called two 
witnesses.9  Rodrigues first called Officer Segobia who testified 
that his Affidavit was based on information that he obtained 
from the CI  and from observing the controlled purchase.  The 
main entrance of the residence was through the carport at the 
top portion of the residence, Officer Segobia testified, but he 
saw the CI walk downstairs and go to the downstairs unit,  not 
the main entrance he described in the search warrant.  The 
officer explained that Rodrigues was living i
n a downstairs unit 
of the residence located on the south portion of the lot.   
The “upstairs unit is completely separate from the 
downstairs unit” such that a person cannot access the downstairs 
unit from the upstairs portion of the residence,  the officer 
                     
 9 The Honorable Henry Nakamoto presided.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN  WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
9 
 explained.  Although Officer Segobia stated  that the CI “wasn’t 
100 percent if there would be a stairwell within [ Rodrigues’ ] 
unit or not” after conducting the controlled purchase , Officer 
Segobia acknowledged that, when he executed the warrant, there 
was no stairway connecting the downstairs unit to the upstairs 
portion of the residence.
  Officer Segobia further acknowledged 
that the unit he described in his Affidavit was “not the unit 
[he] searched.”   
  
Officer Segobia stated that he described the property 
as one residence in his A ffidavit because the Hawai i real 
property tax map described the residence as being a three 
bedroom owned by Yolanda Rodrigues
 (Ms. Rodrigues), who is 
Rodrigues’ mother.  Based on this information, the officer said , 
he concluded that the downstairs unit was not an ohana unit but 
rather a bedroom that is located downstairs of the residence 
that “almost looks like [] an extension” of the residence.   
  
Officer Segobia also testified that his “personal 
friend” and Rodrigues’ brother -in-law, Nick Ah Nee , was the 
resident of the downstairs unit prior to Rodrigues, and that he 
spoke with Ah Nee about the unit before the warrant was 
executed.  Ah Nee said that he lived in the downstairs unit with 
his wife prior to Rodrigues, Officer Segobia explained.
  The 
officer testified that Ah Nee also said that Rodrigues lived ***FOR PUBLICATION IN  WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
10 
 upstairs in an office unit until Ah Nee moved out, at which 
point Rodrigues moved into the downstairs unit and the upstairs 
portion became Ms. Rodrigues’ “portion of the residence.”  
Officer Segobia stated that he had previously visited Ah Nee at 
the residence while Ah Nee was living there.   
  As to his Affidavit, Officer Segobia testified that he 
described the entire residence and the front of the residence 
because “the information [from the CI] was very vague” as to 
whether the upstairs was accessible from Rodrigues’  unit.  He 
also described the residence as a whole, he explained, because 
it is owned by the same person.  Officer Segobia elaborated that 
the CI could not  give him information as to the inside of the 
downstairs unit layout.  The officer added that he “didn’t want 
to get too specific in [his] affidavit since the CI could not 
confirm the information.”  While acknowledging  that the 
description of the area that he wanted to search was nowhere in 
his Affidavit , the officer nonetheless  testified  that the search 
warrant was intended to cover the upstairs portion of the house 
and the downstairs portion of the house.  Officer Segobia stated 
that he described the residence in his Affidavit as “wood siding 
with a white color roof, ” but when questioned,  he acknowledged 
that the downstairs unit was “painted sort of a greenish color” 
and did not have wood siding on it.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN  WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
11 
 As to the execution of the warrant, Officer Segobia 
testified that he approached the downstairs door located on the 
south side of the residence because that door is where he saw 
the CI do a transaction with Rodrigues.  But the officer stated 
he believed, based on the information he obtained from Ah Nee 
that Rodrigues also lived in the residence while Ah Nee lived 
there, that “everybody would have access to everything” inside 
the residence.  W hen he discovered the upstairs portion of the 
residence was not accessible from the downstairs unit, Officer 
Segobia testified, he called the search off in the top portion 
of the residence.  Officer Segobi a further acknowledged that the 
unit he described in his A ffidavit was not the unit he searched.   
  After Officer Segobia’s testimony concluded, Rodrigues 
called Ms. Rodrigues to testify.  
Ms. Rodrigues stated that she 
owned a home located at “[] Puuhalo Street, ” which had three 
bedrooms upstairs and “a separate unit” downstairs.  Rodrigues 
began living in the downstairs unit, and paying rent, about two 
years prior to May 2017, Ms.  Rodrigues testified .  She explained 
that the downstairs unit had a kitchen,  bathroom , and its own 
lock.10   
                     
 10 Ms. Rodrigues testified that she possessed the keys to both the  
downstairs unit and the upstairs portion of the residence at the time of the 
search. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN  WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
12 
   T he circuit court issued Findings of Fact (FOF) and 
Conclusions of Law (COL); Order .  The court determined that 
Officer Segobia’s Affidavit  did not mention the separate 
downstairs residential unit nor did it mention an entrance on 
the lower story and Konalani Street side of the residence.  
Additionally, in FOF 9, the court found that: 
9.  Officer Segobia  testified the downstairs unit is 
separate from the upstairs unit with its own  bedroom, 
bathroom and kitchen.  
 
 
  The court explained that Officer Segobia “admitted he 
did not describe the downstairs unit and side doorway in his 
application for [the] search warrant” but nonetheless “searched 
the downstairs unit which is completely separate from the 
upstairs unit described in the search warrant. ”  The court also 
found that the officer testified that he did not search the 
three bedroom, two bathroom residence with light colored siding 
and white rooftop.  Finally, the court determined that Officer 
Segobia testified that he had been aware at one time that the 
house had been inhabited by multiple individuals and that he was 
personally acquainted with the previous resident and had visited 
the house. 
  The circuit court concluded that the search warrant in 
this case described with particularity the upstairs residence as 
it identified how one must travel to the upstairs residence, 
what the upstairs residence looks like from the outside, as well ***FOR PUBLICATION IN  WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
13 
 as the number of bedrooms and bathrooms in the upstairs unit.  
But the warrant did not describe at all the separate studio unit 
located downstairs, the court explained.  Accordingly, the court 
stated that “[n]othing in the Affidavit describes the studio 
unit on the bottom floor despite Officer Segobia having ample 
facts about this downstairs unit, its separate entrance and 
identifying characteristics.”  Thus, the court concluded that 
the Affidavit and the search warrant did not describe and 
therefore did not authorize the search of the separate 
downstairs studio unit. 
 
 The court also determined that the Affidavit set forth 
facts sufficient to issue a warrant for the upstairs unit and to 
justify a search of that unit, only.  However, in COL 11 the 
court concluded that: 
11.  The Affidavit and the search warrant simply do not 
describe and ther
efore do not authorize the search of the 
separate downstairs studio unit.   
 
  
The court emphasized that  the Affidavit did not set 
forth any facts sufficient to justify a warrant for a search of 
the separate studio unit.  The court additionally  found that 
“Officer Segobia knew or should have known that the residence 
was a multi-unit dwelling with more than one occupant” because 
he “knew the previous resident, and had been to the residence.”  
Further, the “outward appearance of the residence” itself  
suggested that “the downstairs [was] a separate unit”  because it ***FOR PUBLICATION IN  WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
14 
 had a separate entrance, the court determined.  The warrant was 
therefore invalid, the court ruled, because it failed to 
describe with particularity the place to be searched.   
  As to the search itself, the circuit court concluded 
that the warrant did not authorize the search of the separate 
downstairs studio unit, and therefore the search exceeded the 
scope of the warrant.  And the search of the property outside 
the scope of the warrant was invalid in its own right because 
there was no probable cause to justify a search of the 
downstairs studio unit and Rodrigues had a reasonable 
expectation of privacy in the downstairs studio unit,  the court 
ruled.  As a result, the court granted Rodrigues’  Motion and 
ordered the return of his three vehicles and cash.  The State 
filed a timely appeal. 
II. ICA PROCEEDINGS 
  
In a Memorandum Opinion, the ICA stated that the 
State’s appeal turned on the application of rules governing 
“multiple occupancy ” search warrants because the circuit court 
based its decision, in major part, on its implicit factual 
determination that the residence subject to the search at issue 
was a multiple-occupancy dwelling.11   
                     
 11 The ICA’s memorandum opinion can be found at State v. Rodrigues, 
No. CAAP- 17-0000656, 2019 WL 1123752 (App. Mar. 12, 2019).   
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN  WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
15 
   The ICA found that the residence in this case was not 
a multiple-occupancy building because (1) the evidence did not 
demonstrate that Rodrigues maintained exclusive access to the 
lower unit, and (2) the structure had the outward appearance of 
community occupation.  On the second point, the ICA elaborated 
that the residence had one address, one mailbox, and no 
additional doorbell for the lower unit.12  The ICA also explained 
that the property tax records did not indicate there was an 
additional kitchen, bath or bedroom in the lower unit, nor did 
the records indicate that this was a separate dwelling unit.  
Thus, the ICA concluded that the circuit court’s “implicit 
finding” that the structure was a multiple -occupancy building 
was clearly erroneous based on the information Officer Segobia 
had at the time that he applied for a search warrant. 
  The ICA also found that the
 failure of Officer Segobia 
to more specifically describe the internal structure of the 
residence did not render the warrant invalid.  The ICA 
acknowledged that the officer had been inside the lower unit at 
one time, but stated that his knowledge of its particulars was 
not extensive and he thought, although he was not sure, that 
there was an internal staircase.  Additionally, the ICA 
                     
 12 It is unclear what evidence the ICA relied on to determine 
whether a doorbell existed as there was no mention of the word “doorbell” at 
the hearing, and there is nothing in the record discussing one.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN  WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
16 
 explained that the CI could not give more specifics regarding 
the internal structure nor could he confirm whether an internal 
staircase existed at the time.  The warrant authorized the 
search of the entire structure, the ICA determined, because 
Officer Segobia had information that all of the family members 
had access to the entire house.13  The ICA therefore concluded 
that the circuit court erred in concluding that the warrant was 
not sufficiently specific,  and it vacated the circuit court’s  
Findings of Fact and Conclusions  of Law. 
  
Judge Leonard dissented from the ICA ’s decision, 
noting that the State only challenged COL 9 and 11 and did not 
contest any of the other findings of facts, conclusions of law, 
or mixed findings and conclusions.14  These unchallenged mixed 
findings were well- grounded in the testimony and evidence in the 
record and reasonable inferences therefrom, the dissent stated.  
                     
 13 Although Officer Segobia stated that “it appeared that everybody 
would have access to o ther people’s areas” in the residence, he did not 
testify that Ah Nee told him this information.  Rather, despite his knowledge 
that Ah Nee previously occupied the downstairs unit, the officer’s 
supposition was based on the fact that “this [was] a family house.”  
Additionally, Officer Segobia’s Affidavit did not indicate his belief that 
“everybody would have access to other people’s areas.”  
 14 As stated, the challenged conclusions of law were as follows:  
 
9.  Officer Segobia testified the downstairs unit is  
separate from the upstairs unit with its own bedroom, 
bathroom and kitchen.   
 
11.  The Affidavit and the search warrant simply do not 
describe and therefore do not authorize the search of the 
separate downstairs studio unit.   
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN  WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
17 
 The unchallenged findings of fact demonstrated that the 
downstairs unit was separate and distinct from the upstairs 
unit, and that Officer Segobia knew this from personal 
experience and observations, the dissent noted.  The dissent 
explained that the unchallenged conclusions and findings also 
found that Officer Segobia failed to describe the bottom unit in 
his Affidavit and thus failed to justify a warrant or search of 
that unit.  Thus, the State’s contention that COL 9 was clearly 
erroneous was without merit and the State’s challenge to COL 11 
was inconsistent with the Circuit Court’s unchallenged findi ngs 
and the record on appeal, the dissent concluded.   
  The case was remanded to the circuit court for further 
proceedings.  Rodrigues timely filed an application for writ of 
certiorari, which this court accepted.   
III. STANDARD S OF REVIEW  
  We review a circuit court’s findings of fact under a 
“clearly erroneous standard,” and we review its conclusions of 
law de novo.  Mikelson v. United Servs. Auto. Ass’n , 107 Hawai i 
192, 197, 111 P.3d 601, 606 (2005) (quoting RGIS Inventory 
Specialist v. 
Hawaii Civil Rights Comm’n , 104 Hawaii 158, 160, 
86 P.3d 449, 451 (2004)).  Additionally, a conclusion of law 
“that presents mixed questions of fact and law is reviewed under 
the clearly erroneous standard because the conclusion is ***FOR PUBLICATION IN  WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
18 
 dependent upon the facts and circumstances of the particular 
case.”  Booth v. Booth, 90 Hawai i 413, 416, 978 P.2d 851, 854 
(1999) (quoting Poe v. Hawai i Labor Relations Bd. , 87 Hawai i 
191, 195, 953 P.2d 569, 573 (1998)).  But while “[c]onclusions  
of law are not binding upon an appellate court and are freely 
reviewable for their correctness,” LC v. MG & Child Support 
Enforcement Agency, 143 Hawai i 302, 310, 430 P.3d 400, 408 
(2018) (internal quotation marks omitted), unchallenged findings 
of fact are “binding upon this court .”  Kelly v. 1250 Oceanside 
Partners, 111 Hawai i 205, 227, 140 P.3d 985, 1007 (2006).   
IV. DISCUSSION 
A. The Warrant Was Invalid Because It Did Not Particularly 
Describe Rodrigues’ Unit  
  
The Hawai i Constitution provides that “[t]he right of 
the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and 
effects against unreasonable searches, seizures and invasions of 
privacy shall not be violated; and no warrants shall issue but 
upon probable cause . . . and particularly describing the place 
to be searched[.]”15  Haw. Const. art. I, §  7.  The particularity 
requirement ensures that a search pursuant to a warrant 
“limit[s] the police as to where they can search, for otherwise 
the constitutional protection against warrantless searches is 
                     
 15 This language is identical to the language of the Fourth 
Amendment to the United States Constitution.  See  U.S. Const. amend. IV.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN  WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
meaningless.”  State v. Anderson, 84 Hawai i 462, 467, 935 P.2d 
1007, 1012 (1997) (quoting State v. Woolsey, 71 Haw. 638, 640, 
802 P.2d 478, 479 (1990)).  A determination regarding whether a 
warrant satisfies the particularity requirement must be made “on 
a case-by-case basis, taking into account all of the surrounding 
facts and circumstances.”  Id. at 468, 935 P.2d at 1013 (quoting 
State v. Kealoha, 62 Haw. 166, 170-71, 613 P.2d 645, 648 
(1980)).  While “[t]he cornerstone of such a determination is 
the language of the warrant itself,” the “executing officer’s 
prior knowledge as to the place intended to be searched, and the 
description of the place to be searched appearing in the 
probable cause affidavit in support of the search warrant” is 
also relevant.  Id. (quoting State v. Matsunaga, 82 Hawaii 162, 
167, 920 P.2d 376, 381 (App. 1996)).

   A search warrant that authorizes the search of a 
“multiple-occupancy [dwelling] . . . will usually be held 
invalid if it fails to describe the particular subunit
 to be 
searched with sufficient definiteness to preclude a search of 
one or more subunits indiscriminately.”  Id. (quoting 2 Wayne R. 
LaFave, Search and Seizure § 4.5(b), at 526 –29 (3d ed. 1996)).  
That is, the particularity requirement “is not met when only a 
general description of a multiple- occupancy building is 
provided[.]”  68 Am. Jur. 2d Searches & Seizures § 224, 407 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN  WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 (2010).  This is because the “basic requirement” of the Fourth 
Amendment and article I, section 7 “is that the officers who  are 
commanded to search be able from the ‘particular’ description of 
the search warrant to identify the specific place for which 
there is probable cause to believe that a crime is being 
committed.”  2 Wayne R. Lafave et al., Criminal Procedure 
§ 3.4(e), at 186 (4th ed. 2015).  A search warrant, however, is 
not defective for failing to specify a subunit within the 
designated building if the building “from its outward appearance 
would be taken to be a single- occupancy structure and neither 
the affiant nor other investigating officers n or the executing 
officers knew or had reason to know of the structure’s actual 
multiple-occupancy character until execution of the warrant was 
under way.”  A nderson, 84 Hawai i at 468, 935 P.2d at 1013
 
(quoting 2 LaFave, supra , § 4.5(b), at 526 –29).  
  Thus, whether the warrant in this case satisfied the 
particularity requirement entails a determination of (1) whether 
the structure would be 
viewed as a multiple -occupancy structure 
from its outward appearance, and (2) whether the affiant or 
other investigating or executing officers knew or had reason to 
know of the structure’ s actual multiple -occupancy character 
prior to the commencement of execution of the warrant.  See id.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN  WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 If either of these questions yields an affirmative  answer, then 
the search warrant is invalid.    
Here, the downstairs unit had a different appearance 
than the remainder of the residence.  The downstairs unit was 
painted green whereas the rest of the residence was light 
colored, and unlike the upstairs portion of the residence, the 
downstairs unit did not have wood siding.  Additionally, the 
downstairs unit’s roof was not connected to the roof covering 
the rest of the residence.  The downstairs unit also had an 
entrance that was separate from the upstairs portion and 
accessible from a separate street.  A worn path led from the 
entrance of the upstairs residence to the entrance of the 
downstairs unit.  Indeed, the CI that conducted the controlled 
purchase walked along the path and entered the downstairs unit 
through this separate entrance.  And Officer Segobia testified 
that the downstairs unit’s entrance was not the same as the main 
door that he had described in the search warrant.16  These facts 
signaled that the downstairs unit was not internally connected 
to the rest of the residence.  
                     
 16 One factor relevant to whether a unit appears to be a residence 
is whether the unit has “its own access to the outside.”  Anderson, 84 Hawai i 
at 471, 935 P.2d at 1016; see also United States v. Kyles, 40 F.3d 519, 524 
(2d Cir. 1994) (explaining that a “[f]actor[] that indicate[s] a separate 
residence include[s] separate access from the outside” (citing United States 
v. Ayers, 924 F.2d 1468, 1480 ( 9th Cir. 1991); United States v. Hinds , 856 
F.2d 438, 441- 42 (1st Cir. 1988))).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN  WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

   The circuit court specifically determined that the 
residence’s outward appearance indicated the downstairs was a 
separate unit.  The court’s related findings of fact are in 
accord with this determination.  It found that the downstairs 
unit has its own door to the outside and the door has a lock.  
The court also found that the downstairs unit had a different 
appearance than the upstairs portion of the house as the outside 
of the house was green on the bottom and brown on the top and 
the top portion has new lumber and has a different color from 
the downstairs.  Thus, the court determined that Officer Segobia 
had ample facts about the downstairs unit, its separate entrance 
and identifying characteristics.  None of these findings of fact 
were challenged by the State on appeal.17  These findings, and 
the underlying evidence, support the circuit court’s 
unchallenged determination that the outward appearance of the 
residence suggests that the downstairs is a separate unit.  
Thus, the evidence supports  the circuit court’s finding that the 
outward appearance of the residence indicated that the structure 
                     
 17 Despite the unchallenged findings of the circuit court, the ICA 
found the residence had the appearance of “community occupation” because 
there was only one address and one mailbox and because the property tax 
records did not show a separate dwelling unit.  While a single address and 
mailbox can be considered in determining the “outward appearance” of a 
structure, see Anderson, 84 Hawai i at 471, 935 P.2d at 1016, tax records do 
not aid in determining the “outward appearance” of a structure.  The more 
weighty countervailing circumstances that the circuit court considered 
included the different physical appearance and construction materials of the 
two residential units, the unit s’ different roofs, and the separate entrances 
of the units that were on different streets.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN  WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
23 
 described in the search warrant would not be taken as a single-
occupancy structure, and on this basis alone, the warrant was 
not valid.   
  Turning to the second question, t he search warrant 
authorized a search of “a three bedroom, 2 bathroom 
residence .  . . located at []  Puuhalo Street[.]”   The evidence 
shows that Officer Segobia had significant knowledge of the 
details of the downstairs prior to the execution of the search 
warrant.  In addition to the outward appearance of the 
structure, the officer’s knowledge that Ah Nee and his wife 
previously lived in the unit apart from Rodrigues indicated that 
multiple families had been separately living in the building.  
Officer Segobia acknowledged being told by Ah Nee that during 
the time he lived in the unit with his wife,  Rodrigues lived 
“upstairs in an office unit.”   The officer also knew that when 
Ah Nee moved out, Rodrigues moved into the downstairs unit and 
the upstairs portion became his mother’s portion of the 
residence.  And , Officer Segobia had been inside the downstairs 
unit while Ah Nee lived there.  Further, Officer Segobia had 
personal knowledge of the appearance of the building because he 
was both the investigating officer who drafted the A ffidavit and 
the officer that executed the search warrant.   
  The circui t court’s findings of  fact support its  
conclusion that Officer Segobia “knew or should have known” that ***FOR PUBLICATION IN  WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
24 
 the residence he described in his A ffidavit, and that was 
described in the search warrant, “was a multi -unit dwelling with 
more than one occupant.”  The court found that Office r Segobia 
testified that Rodrigues was living in a downstairs unit of the 
residence located on the south portion of the residence.  
Additionally, the court found that the officer had been aware at 
one time that the house had been inhabited by multiple 
individuals and that Officer Segobia was personally acquainted 
with the previous resident and had visited the house.  The 
officer also testified, the court found, that the downstairs 
unit is completely separate from the upstairs unit described in 
the search warrant
.  None of these findings were challenged by 
the State.  Based on these findings, the court determined that 
Officer Segobia knew or should have known that the residence was 
a multi-unit dwelling with more than one occupant.  Thus, the 
evidence in the record supports this finding of fact and 
therefore it was not clearly erroneous.18 
                     
 18 The ICA found that Officer Segobia’s knowledge of the downstairs 
unit’s particulars was not extensive , as he thought, although he was not 
sure, that there was an  internal staircase.  Although Officer Segobia 
testified that the CI “wasn’t 100 percent [sure] if there would be a 
stairwell within [Rodrigues’] unit” and also testified that, “I almost want 
to say there used to be a stairwell and it got blocked off from the bathroom 
area, if I remember correctly,” the circuit court implicitly rejected this 
testimony based on the complete lack of evidentiary support for the prior 
existence of a stairwell or a “blocked” staircase.  This rejection was based 
upon the actual knowledge and descriptions of the officer regarding the 
Rodrigues’ unit, particularly his earlier presence in the unit, as the 
circuit court determined that the Officer knew or should have known that the 
residence was a multi -unit dwelling with more than one occupant.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN  WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
25 
   The court’s findings demonstrate that the residence 
would not “be taken to be a single- occupancy structure ” from its 
outward appearance and that Officer Segobia “ knew or had reason 
to know of the structure’ s actual multiple- occupancy c haracter”  
prior to the execution of the warrant.  Anderson , 84 Hawai i at 
468, 935 P.2d at 1013 (quoting 2 LaFave, supra , § 4.5(b), at 
526–29).  E ither determination rendered the search warrant 
invalid, and the circuit court thus correctly concluded that the 
search warrant in this case failed to describe with 
particularity the place to be searched, despite the officer 
having sufficient information to do so.19  Accordingly, the 
State’s challenge to the circuit court’s COL 9 that the warrant 
did not describe at all the separate studio unit located 
downstairs and its challenge to COL 11 that the search warrant 
did not describe and therefore did not authorize the search of 
the separate downstairs unit
 lack merit.   
                     
 19 The ICA found, however, that the residence was not a multiple -
occupancy dwelling because the evidence did not demonstrate that Rodrigues 
maintained exclusive access to the lower unit as Officer Segobia had 
information that all of the family members had access to the entire house.  
The cases relied upon by the ICA addressing a person’s “exclusive access” to 
a residential unit involved a residence in which multiple people shared a 
common area but had separate bedrooms, not an entirely separate living unit 
as in this case.  Additionally, there was no evidence that anyone besides 
Rodrigues had access to the downstairs unit other than Ms. Rodrigues, who 
rented the unit to Rodrigues and thus had keys to it.  And Officer Segobia’s  
speculation that “it appeared that everybody would have access to other 
people’s areas” in the residence was not based on information provided by Ah 
Nee and, in fact, was contrary to his knowledge that Ah Nee and his wife 
lived in the downstairs unit separate from Rodrigues and Ms. Rodrigues.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN  WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
26 
   Because the search warrant in this case failed to 
satisfy the particularity requirement of article I , section 7 of 
the Hawai i
 Constitution, it was invalid.  See Anderson, 84 
Hawaii at 468, 935 P.2d at 1013 (“A search war rant for a[] . . . 
multiple-occupancy building will [] be held invalid if it fails 
to describe the particular subunit to be searched[.]”) .  
  
The ICA nevertheless concluded that it was error for 
the circuit court to conclude that the warrant was deficient for 
the failure to specifically describe the lower unit.  As 
explained, the circuit court determined that the outward 
appearance of the residence suggests that the downstairs is a 
separate unit.  Additionally, based on the building’s 
appearance, the information that the officer received from Ah 
Nee, and the officer’s prior visit to the residence, the court 
determined that Officer Segobia knew or should have known that 
the residence was a multi- unit dwelling with more than one 
occupant.  Neither finding was challenged by the State before 
the ICA.  Whether the downstairs unit appeared to be separate 
based on the “outward appearance of the residence” was plainly a 
factual finding, determined by the circuit court based upon the 
testimony and photographs of the exterior of the structure ***FOR PUBLICATION IN  WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
27 
 introduced into evidence at the hearing.20  It is well-
established that appellate courts must review challenged 
findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard and that 
unchallenged findings of fact are binding upon appellate courts.  
Kelly v. 1250 Oceanside Partners, 111 Hawai i 205, 227, 140 P.3d 
985, 1007 (2006); Okada Trucking Co. v. Bd. of Water Supply,  97 
Hawaii 450, 458, 40 P.3d 73, 81 (2002).  The ICA nonetheless 
found that the residence had the “outward appearance of 
community occupation.”  Because the circuit court’s unchallenged 
finding was binding on the ICA, it was error for the ICA to make 
a factual finding as to the appearance of the structure that was 
contrary to the circuit court’s finding.  See Kelly, 111 Hawaii 
at 227, 140 P.3d at 1007.   
  Similarly, the circuit court’s determination that 
Officer Segobia knew or should have known that the residence was 
a multi-unit dwelling with more than one occupant was a factual 
determination; it involved the court examining the evidence 
regarding the appearance of the residence, the information that 
the officer received from Ah Nee, and the officer’s prior visit 
to the residence.  But the ICA determined that Officer Segobia 
                     
 20 Some of the circuit court’s findings of fact in this case were 
labeled as conclusions of law.  We have recognized, however, that “a finding 
of fact is not freely reviewable by reason of its label as a conclusion of 
law.”  Molokoa Vill. Dev. Co. v. Kauai Elec. Co., 60 Haw. 582, 596, 593 P.2d 
375, 384 (1979).   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN  WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
28 
 did not have sufficient knowledge that the residence was a 
multi-unit dwelling.  It was error for the ICA to make a 
determination regarding Officer Segobia’s knowledge of the 
character of the residence that was contrary to an unchallenged 
finding made by the circuit court to which the ICA was bound.  
Id.  Thus, the ICA erred in not accepting the circ uit court’s 
findings of fact and in concluding the particularity requirement 
was satisfied.  See Anderson , 84 Hawai i at 468, 935 P.2d at 
1013.  
B. The Search Violated Rodrigues’ Constitutional Rights  
  
It is well- established that any warrantless search of 
a constitutionally protected area is “presumptively unreasonable 
unless there is both probable cause and a legally recognized 
exception to the warrant requirement.”  State v. Phillips, 138 
Hawaii 321, 336, 382 P.3d 133, 148 (2016); State v. Wallace
, 80 
Hawaii 382, 393, 910 P.2d 695, 706 (1996); 
State v. Bonnell, 75 
Haw. 124, 137, 856 P.2d 1265, 1273 (1993).  There has been no 
assertion at any point in the course of this litigation that an 
exception to the warrant requirement applied.  Thus, the search 
of Rodrigues’ residence violated his constitutional right 
against unreasonable searches under article I, section 7 of the 
Hawaii Constitution.  The circuit court properly granted ***FOR PUBLICATION IN  WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
29 
 Rodrigues’ motion to suppress, and the ICA erred in vacating the 
circuit court’s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.  
V. CONCLUSION 
  Accordingly, the ICA’s April 10, 2019 Judgment o n 
Appeal is vacated, and the case is remanded to the circuit court 
for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
