RECKTENWALD, C.J., McKENNA, AND EDDINS, JJ., 
CIRCUIT JUDGE SOUZA AND CIRCUIT JUDGE KAWASHIMA, 
ASSIGNED BY REASON OF VACANCIES 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY EDDINS, J.  
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
I. 
In this wrongful death case, Tiare Franco’s family (the 
Francos) appeal, again. Last time they successfully appealed 
the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit’s declaratory judgment 
action ruling that National Interstate Insurance Company (NIIC) 
had no duty to defend or indemnify Sabio Reinhardt. The Francos 
allege Reinhardt negligently crashed a truck, killing passenger 
Tiare Franco. 
The Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) vacated the 
declaratory judgment. It concluded that there were “genuine issues of material fact regarding whether Reinhardt reasonably 
believed he was entitled to operate the Truck at the time of the 
fatal accident.” Nat’l Interstate Ins. Co., Inc. v. Reinhardt, 
No. CAAP-14-0001066, 2017 WL 1210101, at *2 (Haw. App. March 31, 2017) (mem. op.). 
However, before the ICA resolved the Franco’s declaratory 
action appeal, the circuit court held a jury trial. Neither Reinhardt nor defense counsel participated. The Francos won. 
The jury returned a multi-million dollar verdict in their favor. 
After the ICA’s decision, NIIC again retained counsel for 
Reinhardt. 
It was the same attorney who had represented him 
during the three-year period preceding the circuit court’s 
declaratory action ruling. Per Hawaiʻi Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP) 60(b), counsel moved to set aside the jury’s verdict. 
2  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The Francos opposed the motion. And they moved to disqualify 
Reinhardt’s counsel. They said counsel had a conflict and 
violated the Hawaiʻi Rules of Professional Conduct (HRPC) by 
acting without Reinhardt’s consent. 
The trial court denied the Francos’ motion to disqualify 
counsel. 
It granted Reinhardt’s motion to set aside the jury 
verdict and judgment. The Francos appealed. 
In a memorandum opinion, the ICA held that Reinhardt’s 
counsel lacked authority to act as his lawyer. Since Reinhardt 
had not expressly consented to re-engage defense counsel, the 
lawyer lacked consent to represent him and advance his 
interests. The lawyer violated the Hawaiʻ i Rules of Professional 
Conduct, the ICA ruled: “Retained Counsel did not have the 
authority or Reinhardt’s consent to file motions on behalf of Reinhardt.” Since the lawyer had no authority to file it, the 
ICA chose not to reach the merits of the HRCP Rule 60(b) motion. 
The ICA reinstated the jury’s verdict and judgment. 
We disagree with the ICA’s view that counsel had no 
authority to act on Reinhardt’s behalf. Reinhardt implicitly 
consented to the representation, did not invoke his right to 
refuse counsel, and there was no conflict that barred the 
representation. We hold that the circuit court correctly denied 
the Francos’ motion to disqualify counsel. Counsel did not violate the HRPC by moving to set the judgment aside. 
3  
  
 
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
We also hold that the circuit court did not abuse its 
discretion by granting Reinhardt’s motion to set aside. 
We vacate the ICA’s Judgment, affirm the circuit court’s 
orders, and remand the case to the circuit court for proceedings 
consistent with this opinion. 
II. 
On June 20, 2011 Reinhardt allegedly crashed his 
girlfriend’s 2005 Dodge Ram pickup. Front passenger Tiare 
Franco died. Her family sued Reinhardt for wrongful death. 
NIIC, insurance carrier for the truck, retained counsel to 
defend Reinhardt. Separately, NIIC filed a declaratory action. 
NIIC claimed it had no duty to defend and indemnify Reinhardt 
under the policy. Then it moved for summary judgment. The 
circuit court granted NIIC’s MSJ. The insurance company had no 
duty to defend Reinhardt. His lawyer withdrew. 
In 2015, the Francos appealed the circuit court’s 
declaratory judgment decision. NIIC’s policy covered Reinhardt, 
they argued. Meanwhile, with the declaratory action appeal 
pending, the circuit court scheduled a jury trial. Plaintiffs 
did not request a pause. Though the appeal awaited resolution, 
the trial started. 
Reinhardt did not show up. Turns out, he left prison about 
a month before jury selection. He had resolved the criminal 
case associated with the homicide. Per a plea agreement, he 
4  
   
  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
pled no contest to negligent homicide in the third degree, a 
misdemeanor, and received a one-year credit for time served 
sentence. After he left prison, no one knew where he was. 
No lawyer appeared for Reinhardt. A jury listened to the 
case. On April 28, 2016, it found Reinhardt negligent and 
awarded the Francos $3,562,000. On May 18, 2016, the court 
entered final judgment. 
Ten months later, the ICA ruled for the Francos in the 
declaratory action appeal. The circuit court should not have granted NIIC’s summary judgment motion. There were disputed 
issues of material fact about NIIC’s duty to defend or indemnify 
Reinhardt. 
NIIC retained the same attorney to represent Reinhardt. 
But by this point, almost a year had passed since the judgment. 
The time to file a notice of appeal had long lapsed, and the 
HRCP Rule 60(b) motion to set aside deadline – one year or 
“reasonable time” - loomed. 
NIIC reached Reinhardt by certified mail. NIIC’s letter 
informed Reinhardt about the ICA’s remand, that NIIC had retained the same lawyer for him under a reservation of rights, 
and that counsel would move to set aside the judgment against 
him. It included counsel’s contact information. Reinhardt 
signed for the letter. 
5  
  
 
 
  
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Back on board, counsel hustled to find Reinhardt. He sent 
letters and left voicemails. Investigators tried to locate 
Reinhardt. Soon the attorney felt compelled to act. As he put 
it: 
We did do our best to try to contact him which then puts me 
in a weird position because what do I do? Sit on my hands 
and allow the one- year time period to lapse or do I do 
something and I file the motion? Well, I’ m not going to 
sit on my hands. I’m going to do my best to try to defend 
him properly, and that’ s why we filed this motion, your 
Honor, and that’ s why we’ re here today. 
On May 18, 2017, counsel moved under HRCP Rule 60(b)(5) 
(judgment “no longer equitable”) and Rule 60(b)(6) 
(“extraordinary circumstances”) to set aside the $3.56 million 
final judgment. Setting aside the judgment is equitable, 
counsel insisted. The one-sided, lawyer-less trial shouldn’t 
have happened. Reinhardt awaited an appellate decision about 
whether NIIC had a duty to defend him at that trial. 
Plus, Reinhardt alleged several trial errors: (1) the 
Francos’ attorney made improper statements during jury selection; (2) inadmissible hearsay evidence came in; (3) a 
police officer improperly testified about the identity of the 
driver (Reinhardt); (4) DNA evidence lacked a proper chain of 
custody; and (5) counsel made improper closing arguments, 
including referencing other multi-million dollar jury verdicts, 
like an ESPN sportscaster’s $55 million invasion of privacy 
6  
   
  
  
  
  
  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
case, and deriding Reinhardt’s invocation of his Fifth Amendment 
right against self-incrimination. 
Not only did the Francos oppose the Rule 60(b) motion, they 
moved to disqualify Reinhardt’s counsel. They leveled ethical 
accusations against him. They said he broke several HRPC rules, 
including failing to get Reinhardt’s consent to file the motion. 
Regarding the motion to set aside, the Francos argue there 
were no exceptional circumstances to justify setting aside the judgment. Rather, NIIC just gambled – by not defending 
Reinhardt at trial - and lost. 
The circuit court denied the Francos’ motion to disqualify 
counsel. It granted Reinhardt’s motion to set aside the final 
judgment. 
The Francos appealed. The ICA issued a Memorandum Opinion on February 28, 2023. 
The ICA only addressed one point of error: Did the trial court err by denying the Francos’ motion to disqualify counsel? 
Yes, the ICA decided. Counsel lacked authority to 
represent Reinhardt when he filed the Rule 60(b) motion to set aside. Reinhardt had to expressly consent before counsel moved 
to set aside the $3,562,000 judgment. Otherwise, counsel defies 
the Hawaiʻ i Rules of Professional Conduct. With counsel out of 
the way, the ICA ruled, the Rule 60(b) motion to set-aside 
7  
   
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
should never have happened. The ICA vacated the order setting 
aside the default judgment. 
Reinhardt applied for cert, and we accepted. 
III. 
“The tripartite relationship between insurer, insured and 
insurance defense counsel is unique.” Finley v. Home Ins. Co., 
90 Hawaiʻ i 25, 29, 975 P.2d 1145, 1149 (1998).  Counsel 
represents the insured, but the insurance company pays their 
fee. This creates a potential conflict of interest. When the 
insurance company defends under a reservation of rights, “the 
insurer may be more concerned with developing facts showing non-
coverage than facts defeating liability.” Id. at 30, 975 P.2d 
at 1150. This relationship can trigger counsel’s ethical 
obligations under the HRPC. 
The Hawaiʻi Rules of Professional Conduct are elastic, not 
stiff. “The Rules of Professional Conduct are rules of reason. 
They should be interpreted with reference to the purposes of 
legal representation and of the law itself.” HRPC Scope (eff. 
2014). This is how we construe the rules. Fragiao v. State
, 95 
Hawaiʻi 9, 18, 18 P.3d 871, 880 (2001). 
The HRPC and American Bar Association Model Rules of 
Professional Conduct have another key goal: ensuring that the legal industry’s regulations are conceived in the public 
interest and improve access to the legal system. 
HRPC Preamble 
8  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
cmts. 6, 12 (eff. 2014); Model Rules of Pro. Conduct, Preamble 
cmts. 6, 12 (Am. Bar Ass’n 2023). Interpreting and enforcing 
the HRPC in a way that promotes access to our legal system, 
rather than restricts it, fulfills a chief aim of professional 
conduct rules. That purpose informs our analysis. 
We address three issues: whether the circuit court abused 
its discretion when it denied the Francos’ motion to disqualify 
Reinhardt’s attorney; whether the attorney violated the HRPC when he filed a Rule 60(b) motion to set aside the judgment; and 
whether the circuit court abused its discretion when it set the 
judgment aside. 
We hold that insurance defense counsel may obtain the 
consent that the HRPC requires by communicating information 
reasonably sufficient for the client to appreciate the 
significance of the matter. See HRPC Rule 1.0(c) (eff. 2014) 
(defining “consult”). We therefore conclude that Reinhardt’s counsel obtained consent and did not violate the HRPC by moving to set aside the verdict. 
We further hold that the trial court did not abuse its 
discretion by granting Reinhardt’s HRCP Rule 60(b) motion to set 
aside. Equity principles guide 60(b). JK v. DK
, 153 Hawaiʻi 
268, 274, 533 P.3d 1215, 1221 (2023). We apply 60(b) liberally, 
“favoring a merits-oriented outcome that bends the rule’s 
finality interest to accomplish justice.” Id.Neither 
9  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Reinhardt nor any defense counsel participated in the trial, 
which contained several putative errors. The circuit court 
later found that the trial “was the embodiment of an unusual 
case” justifying relief. We agree. 
A. 
First, the motion to disqualify counsel. 
Because there was no ethical violation, the circuit court 
correctly denied the Francos’ motion to disqualify. The ICA 
erred. 
Reinhardt’s counsel had no business representing him, the 
ICA rules. The client didn’t consent after consultation – not 
to the attorney-client relationship and not to the filing of the 
Rule 60(b) motion to set aside. The lawyer was practicing law 
without a client, the ICA suggests. 
To support its belief that counsel had no client, the ICA 
looks to Finley and four Hawaiʻ i Rules of Professional Conduct 
rules: Rule 1.7 (eff. 2014) (not getting consent and a conflict waiver before representing Reinhardt), Rule 1.8 (eff. 2014) 
(accepting payment from NIIC without Reinhardt’s express consent), Rule 1.2 (eff. 2015) (lawyer shall abide by 
Reinhardt’s decisions), and Rule 1.4 (eff. 2014) (lawyer will 
consult Reinhardt). We take each in turn. 
Like the present case, Finley concerns an insurer who 
retains counsel for an insured party. It examines whether the 
10  
  
  
  
  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
insurer also has to pay for the insured’s personally retained 
counsel. Id. 90 Hawaiʻ i at 27, 975 P.2d at 1147.  
The ICA relies on Finley’s discussion about the insured’s 
“right to reject” - under a reservation of rights - the 
insurer’s retained counsel. See id. at 35, 975 P.2d at 1155. 
The ICA concludes that Reinhardt’s lawyer could not establish an attorney-client relationship without his affirmative consent. 
True, Reinhardt has a right to refuse NIIC’s retained 
counsel. But the ICA overlooks something - Reinhardt never 
refused counsel’s help. 
The ICA misconstrues Finley to mean that unless an insured 
expressly consents, counsel lacks the authority to act. But Finley stands for express rejection. Thanks, but no thanks. 
It’s the insured’s refusal to go with retained counsel that has 
to be express. See Finley, 90 Hawaiʻ i at 35, 975 P.2d at 1155.  
Not refusing may manifest implied consent. See id. (the 
defendants’ choice to retain their own counsel “did not operate 
as an exercise of their right to reject the tender of the 
defense under a reservation of rights”). 
Finley’s conclusion illustrates this point. There, the 
insured wanted the insurance company to pay both the lawyers it 
provided and the lawyers the insured hired itself. Id.We held 
that because the insured did not object to the insurance 
company’s retained counsel, the insurance company only had to 
11  
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
pay for the counsel it retained. Id.The determinative fact to 
our analysis concerned whether the insured rejected retained 
counsel. 
Nothing in the record shows that Reinhardt rejected NIIC’s 
offer of counsel. NIIC’s May 13, 2017 letter recaps the case 
and reintroduces his previous attorney. After recounting the 
circumstances that led to counsel withdrawing, NIIC alerts 
Reinhardt about its decision to retain counsel and to instruct counsel to quickly file an HRCP Rule 60(b) motion. The letter 
provides counsel’s contact information, the filing deadline, and 
NIIC’s reservation of rights. Reinhardt signed an 
acknowledgement that he received the certified letter. Though 
Reinhardt did not expressly consent to counsel, he also did not 
expressly reject counsel. 
If Reinhardt thinks retained counsel has violated any 
ethical rules, he is not out of luck. He has remedies. As we 
said in Finley
: “These remedies include: (1) an action against 
the attorney for professional malpractice; (2) an action against 
the insurer for bad faith conduct; and (3) estoppel of the 
insurer to deny indemnification.” 90 Hawaiʻi at 35, 975 P.2d at 
1155. We found those remedies “adequate to deter unethical 
conduct on the behalf of the insurer and retained counsel.” Id.
We believe the circuit court properly recognized that 
denying the motion to disqualify would not hurt Reinhardt if he 
12  
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
later decided he didn’t want that lawyer to represent him. As 
the court put it: “any error in denying this motion can be 
quickly and harmlessly remedied if Defendant Reinhardt is 
finally located and contacted and expressed a desire, perhaps, 
not to retain [Retained Counsel] as counsel at that time.” 
B. 
We turn to the Hawaiʻi Rules of Professional Conduct. 
Divided loyalties inspire conflict of interest rules. 
“Virtually all difficult ethical problems arise from conflict 
between a lawyer’s responsibilities to clients, to the legal 
system and to the lawyer’s own interest in remaining an ethical 
person while earning a satisfactory living.” 
HRPC Preamble 9. 
Rule 1.7 governs conflicts of interest. A conflict exists 
if the representations directly conflict or “there is a significant risk that the representation of one or more clients 
will be materially limited by the lawyer’s responsibilities 
to . . . a third person” (emphasis added). If a conflict 
exists, the client must give their informed consent to enable 
the representation. HRPC Rule 1.7(b). 
Rule 1.7’s commentary explains that a material limitation 
is a significant risk that the conflict will “materially interfere with the lawyer’s independent professional judgment in 
considering alternatives or foreclose courses of action that 
reasonably should be pursued on behalf of the client.” HRPC 
13  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Rule 1.7(b) cmt. 8. Comment 13 specifically addresses 
situations where an insurer hires counsel for an insured. It 
requires that “the arrangement should assure the special 
counsel’s professional independence.” 
Reinhardt’s retained counsel did not have a Rule 1.7 
conflict. There was no direct conflict. The retained 
attorney’s sole client is the insured. Finley
, 90 Hawaiʻi at 33, 
975 P.2d at 1153. NIIC and Reinhardt shared an interest in 
contesting Reinhardt’s liability and setting aside the judgment. 
And NIIC’s reservation of rights – where NIIC’s and Reinhardt’s 
interests do conflict - was litigated in a separate declaratory 
judgment action and is not at issue here. 
There was also no material limitation. 
NIIC retained 
counsel for Reinhardt. Then it got out of the way. NIIC did not constrain Reinhardt’s lawyer from independently using his 
professional judgment to advance Reinhardt’s interests. There 
was no limitation, much less a material limitation, to counsel’s 
representation of Reinhardt. In the absence of a material 
limitation, Rule 1.7 is simply not pertinent. Fragiao
, 95 
Hawaiʻi at 20, 18 P.3d 882. 
Rule 1.8(f)(1) disallows “compensation for representing a 
client from one other than the client” unless “
the client 
consents after consultation” (emphasis added). Rule 1.0(c) defines “consultation” as “communication of information 
14  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
reasonably sufficient to permit the client to appreciate the 
significance of the matter.” Reasonably sufficient information 
ordinarily includes “a disclosure of the facts and circumstances 
giving rise to the situation, any explanation reasonably 
necessary to inform the client or other person of the material 
advantages and disadvantages of the proposed course of conduct, 
and a discussion of the client’s or other person’s options and 
alternatives.” HRPC Rule 1.0 cmt. 2. The needed communication depends on the circumstances. Id.
Regarding Rule 1.8(f)(1), the ICA says that because NIIC 
paid Reinhardt’s lawyer without his express consent, the lawyer 
broke the rule. We interpret the rule according to its purpose. 
HRPC Scope. Rule 1.8(f)’s commentary provides that the purpose 
is to prevent conflicts “[b]ecause third-party payers frequently 
have interests that differ from those of the client, including 
interests in minimizing the amount spent on the representation 
and in learning how the representation is progressing[.]” HRPC Rule 1.8(f) cmt. 11. Commonly, this happens when an alleged 
conspirator pays a co-conspirator’s legal bills. See, e.g., 
United States v. Hodge & Zweig, 548 F.2d 1347, 1350 (9th Cir. 1977) (drug-smuggling conspiracy allegedly included funding co-
conspirators’ legal defense). 
We held in Fragiao that “the purpose of Rule 1.8(f) is to 
mandate disclosure of the fact that the lawyer’s services are 
15  
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
being paid for by a third party.” 95 Hawaiʻ i at 21, 18 P.3d at 
883 (cleaned up). NIIC’s letter to Reinhardt provided that 
disclosure. The letter communicated that counsel would represent Reinhardt in the Francos’ suit and NIIC was paying 
under a reservation of rights. This was enough for Reinhardt to 
understand the representation. The letter provided Reinhardt 
with consultation, and his inaction, in the unique insurer-
insured context, manifested implicit consent. 
To further support counsel’s putative ethical lapse, the 
ICA turns to HRPC Rule 1.2(a). Per that rule, an attorney’s 
legal decisions, the ICA says, require active consent from the 
client. The rule states: “a lawyer shall abide by a client’s decisions concerning the objectives of representation, and, as 
required by Rule 1.4, shall consult with the client as to the 
means by which the objectives are to be pursued. A lawyer may 
take such action on behalf of the client as is impliedly 
authorized to carry out the representation.” HRPC Rule 1.2(a). 
Rule 1.4(a)(2) requires counsel to “reasonably consult with the 
client about the means by which the client’s objectives are to be accomplished.” 
NIIC’s letter does the trick. The letter alerted Reinhardt 
that counsel’s representation had the same objective as years 
earlier – to contest Reinhardt’s liability for the lethal crash. 
The letter gave Reinhardt the opportunity to follow up: it 
16  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
provided counsel’s contact information and told him about 
counsel’s imminent motion. A one-way certified letter falls 
short of our ideal standard for client communication, but 
Reinhardt was a difficult client to find; it took two private 
investigators to finally track him down. We conclude that the 
letter sufficed to reestablish representation under the 
circumstances. 
C. 
Once Reinhardt’s attorney was back in the game, he had the 
authority, and the obligation, to file the Rule 60(b) motion. 
Counsel did not violate the HRPC. He did the right thing. 
One of a lawyer’s foremost duties is to advocate diligently 
for the client’s interests. HRPC Rule 1.3 (eff. 2014). The 
Comments to Rule 1.3 state that the lawyer should “take whatever 
lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client’s 
cause” and act “with commitment and dedication to the interests 
of the client and with zeal in advocacy upon the client’s behalf.” HRPC Rule 1.3 cmt. 1. Allowing an uncontested $3.56 
million judgment to stand unchallenged skirts this duty. 
Strategic decisions are part of a lawyer’s job. Not every 
decision needs a sign-off. The HRPC talks about the big things 
-unilateral case-ending decisions, like settling a civil case 
or taking a plea deal. HRPC Rule 1.2(a). On those issues, the client has the ultimate authority. The lawyer shall abide by 
17  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
their decision. Id.; HRPC Rule 1.2 cmt. 1. As to how to carry 
out representation, the lawyer may take actions that are 
impliedly authorized. HRPC Rule 1.2(a). 
Here, filing the motion to set aside was implicitly 
authorized. Reinhardt knew about NIIC’s decision to re-retain 
counsel for him. And NIIC told him about the lawyer’s need to 
quickly file the motion to set aside. Nothing about the motion 
compromised Reinhardt’s rights or ended the case. Rather, the motion preserved Reinhardt’s rights and prolonged the case so 
that he could present a defense on the merits. Counsel didn’t 
need Reinhardt’s express consent to file the motion (which 
plainly protected his client’s interests). 
Further, counsel was obligated by NIIC’s duty of good faith 
to Reinhardt. Hawaiʻ i law endorses a stout duty to defend.  If 
there’s the possibility of coverage under the policy, the insurance company must defend. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co.
v. Bodell Constr. Co., ___ Hawaiʻ i ___, 2023 WL 7517083, at *2-3 
(2023). In turn, the insured is entitled to independent 
representation. 
The three-headed relationship of insurer, insured, and 
insurance defense counsel imposes special good faith duties on 
the insurer. Finley, 90 Hawaiʻ i at 36, 975 P.2d at 1156. 
Because there are inherent potential conflicts of interest, an 
insurance company must meet an exacting and enhanced standard of 
18  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
good faith when it defends a case under a reservation of rights. 
See id. at 35, 975 P.2d at 1155. 
We have described the insurer’s duty of good faith: 
investigate the accident, retain competent defense counsel for 
the insured, understand that the only client is the insured, 
fully inform the insured about the defense and all relevant 
developments to the policy and the lawsuit, and avoid 
prioritizing the insurer’s financial interests over the insured’s. Id. at 36-37, 975 P.2d at 1156-57. 
Here, NIIC owes a duty of good faith to Reinhardt as an 
alleged insured. Nothing in the record shows that counsel acted 
in anything but Reinhardt’s best interests by moving to set 
aside the judgment against him. Cf. Delmonte v. State Farm Fire
& Cas. Co., 90 Hawaiʻ i 39, 51, 975 P.2d 1159, 1171 (1999) 
(referring to retained counsel’s duty to look after “the best 
interests of [the] client,” the insured party). Counsel had a 
duty “to provide competent, ethical representation to the 
insured.” Finley, 90 Hawaiʻ i at 34, 975 P.2d at 1154.  Both NIIC 
and counsel must act to protect Reinhardt’s rights. Id.Moving 
to set aside the judgment against Reinhardt satisfied these 
duties. Not moving to set aside ignores these duties. Even 
without Reinhardt’s express consent to file the motion, counsel fulfilled NIIC’s duty of good faith towards Reinhardt. 
19  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The duty of good faith also requires that insurance defense 
counsel provide a defense which meets the HRPC’s ethical 
standards. Id. at 35, 975 P.2d at 1155. As discussed above, 
retained counsel’s representation, including filing the Rule 60(b) motion, complied with counsel’s professional obligations. 
Counsel did not violate the HRPC by moving to set aside an 
uncontested $3.56 million judgment against his client. The 
attorney’s move was implicitly authorized by the representation, required by NIIC’s duty of good faith, and crucial to protecting 
Reinhardt’s interests. 
IV. 
Last, the circuit court correctly set aside the verdict. 
We review decisions on HRCP Rule 60(b) motions for abuse of 
discretion. JK, 153 Hawaiʻ i at 278, 533 P.3d at 1225.  The 
circuit court did not abuse its discretion – it did the right 
thing. 
Equity principles guide Rule 60(b) motions. Id. at 274,

Generally, our justice system disfavors default, preferring 
adjudication on the merits. Id. at 278, 533 P.3d at 1225. 
Rule 60(b) provides several avenues to vacate a judgment. 
Rule 60(b)(5) permits relief when “it is no longer equitable 
that the judgment should have prospective application[.]” The

moving party must show “extraordinary circumstances justifying 
relief.” Matter of Hawaiian Elec. Co., Inc., 149 Hawaiʻ i 343, 
362, 489 P.3d 1255, 1274 (2021). 
Rule 60(b)(6) operates when “any other reason justif[ies] 
relief.” The moving party must demonstrate “extraordinary 
circumstances” why it could not have sought earlier, more timely 
relief. James B. Nutter & Co. v. Namahoe, 153 Hawaiʻ i 149, 169, 
528 P.3d 222, 242 (2023). Under both Rule 60(b)(5) and (b)(6), 
the motion for relief must be made “within a reasonable time.” 
This case presents extraordinary circumstances. The 
circuit court held a jury trial while NIIC’s duty to defend was 
pending before the ICA. NIIC’s assigned defense counsel had 
withdrawn. Reinhardt had recently been released from prison and 
no one – the court or plaintiff’s counsel – could contact him. As a result, the trial happened without a defendant or defense 
counsel sitting at the defense table. 
Not only was Reinhardt unrepresented and not present, but 
several ostensible errors plagued the trial. During jury 
selection, the Francos’ counsel made extensive factual and legal 
arguments to potential jurors. This may be improper. See,
e.g., State v. Altergott, 57 Haw. 492, 499, 559 P.2d 728, 734 (1977) (inappropriate to educate the jury panel on facts, 
instruct them on law, or present argument). The Francos’ 
21  
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
counsel also elicited seemingly inadmissible hearsay testimony 
from the police officers who investigated the crash. 
In her closing argument, counsel disparaged Reinhardt for 
invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination: 
“Why would you refuse to answer questions if you have nothing to 
hide?” – which may violate Reinhardt’s rights under the Hawaiʻ i 
Constitution. See Ramil v. Keller, 68 Haw. 608, 620-21, 726 
P.2d 254, 262 (1986) (leaving open the question of whether the 
Hawaiʻi Constitution right against self-incrimination applies to 
civil cases). Counsel also discussed a sportscaster’s $55 million jury verdict. See Ching v. Dung, 148 Hawaiʻ i 416, 433, 
477 P.3d 856, 873 (2020) (“closing arguments should only refer 
to evidence in the record”). 
The Francos counter that these objections were waived 
because no one objected at trial (neither Reinhardt nor counsel 
were in the courtroom). The defense-less trial and its many 
probable errors created extraordinary circumstances justifying 
relief. 
The trial should not have been defense-less. NIIC should 
have defended Reinhardt pending a final resolution of coverage. If there's a possibility of coverage - even a remote possibility 
-the insurer has the duty to defend. St. Paul, 2023 WL 
7517083, at *2-3. That duty continues until the obligation has been conclusively eliminated. Newhouse by Skow v. Citizens Sec.

Mut. Ins. Co., 501 N.W.2d 1, 6 (Wis. 1993) (“An insurance 
company breaches its duty to defend if a liability trial goes 
forward during the time a no coverage determination is pending 
on appeal and the insurance company does not defend its insured 
at the liability trial.”); Commerce & Indus. Ins. Co. v. Bank of 
Hawaii, 73 Haw. 322, 329, 832 P.2d 733, 737 (1992) (“The duty to 
defend continues until the potential for liability is finally 
resolved, which in this case would require [the insurer] to remain obligated to defend until either HRCP Rule 54(b) 
certification was granted and the appeal period had expired or a 
final judgment had disposed of the entire case.”). 
Here, the Francos timely appealed the declaratory judgment, 
keeping NIIC on the hook to defend Reinhardt. During the 
appellate process, NIIC was obligated to represent Reinhardt in 
the underlying case. Despite NIIC’s breach, this case still 
presents extraordinary circumstances, including that the circuit 
court did not stay the proceedings pending resolution of the declaratory judgment, Reinhardt was missing, and there were many 
alleged trial issues. 
Reinhardt’s counsel filed his motion to set aside within 
the reasonable time that Rule 60(b) requires. The ICA remanded 
the issue of NIIC’s duty to defend or indemnify on March 31, 
2017, nearly ten and a half months after the final judgment. 
Once reengaged, counsel moved for relief within one month of

being back on the case and within one year from the judgment – 
well within a reasonable time. Counsel could not have sought 
earlier, more timely relief. 
The circuit court seems to realize it made a mistake by 
forging ahead with trial. It concluded “extraordinary 
circumstances surrounding the trial” warranted HRCP Rule 60(b) 
relief. We agree. 
V. 
We hold that the circuit court properly denied the Francos’ 
motion to disqualify Reinhardt’s attorney. We therefore 
conclude that counsel’s motion to set aside the verdict against 
Reinhardt did not violate the HRPC. We also hold that 
extraordinary circumstances supported setting aside the verdict. 
We vacate the ICA’s Judgment, affirm the circuit court’s 
orders, and remand the case to the circuit court.
