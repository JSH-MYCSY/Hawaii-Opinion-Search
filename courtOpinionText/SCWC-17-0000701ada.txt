  We held in State v. Mainaaupo, 117 Hawai i 235, 178 
P.3d 1 (2008), that the foundational privilege against self
-
incrimination, commonly referred to as the “right to remain 
silent,” attaches during post-arrest police interrogation.  We Electronically Filed

2 later expanded the scope of this privilege to pre-arrest
detainment.  State v. Tsujimura, 140 Hawai i 299, 400 P.3d 500
(2017).  This case explores 
if a suspect’s refusal to reenact 
the incident for which the suspect is being interviewed invokes
the right to remain silent and if the prosecution’s referenc e 
to the suspect’s refusal at trial violates that right.   
In 2016, Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant Anthony G.  
Beaudet-Close (Beaudet-Close) was involved in an altercation  
with Luke Ault ( Ault) during which Beaudet-Close allegedly
punched and kicked Ault multiple times.  As a result of the 
altercation, Ault sustained permanent and life-threatening 
injuries.  Beaudet-Close was charged with Attempted Murder in 
the Second Degree and Assault in the First Degree. 
At trial, the State played for the jury a video of a 
detective interviewing Beaudet-Close (police interview video).  
The police interview video concluded with Beaudet-Close 
declining the detective’s request that Beaudet -Close reenact the 
altercation.  
Beaudet-Close filed a motion for a mistrial after the 
jury viewed the police interview video, arguing that it was an 
impermissible comment on his invocation of his right to remain 
silent.  The circuit court denied Beaudet-Close’s motion and 
trial continued. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
The jury convicted Beaudet-Close of Attempted Murder 
in the Second Degree and the circuit court sentenced Beaudet-
Close to life in prison.  The ICA affirmed the Judgment of 
Conviction and Sentence on appeal. 
3 In his application for writ of certiorari, Beaudet-
Close argues that he invoked his right to remain silent when he 
refused to participate in a reenactment and that the 
prosecutor’s decision to play a video of that refusal before the 
jury was an improper comment on his invocation of that right. 
We agree.  We hold that Beaudet- Close invoked his 
right to remain silent when he declined to participate in a 
reenactment of the encounter and that his right to do so was 
infringed when the prosecution played the police interview video 
before the jury at trial.  
I. BACKGROUND
On November 9, 2016, the State of Hawai i (the State)
charged Beaudet-Close by complaint with Attempted Murder in the 
Second Degree and Assault in the First Degree.  
The charge arose
from an altercation that took place between Beaudet -Close and 
Ault on October 28, 2016 in Kailua Kona on the island of Hawai i.
Ault was seriously injured during the altercation.

 A. Trial  
Beaudet-Close’s jury trial began on July 11, 2017.   
During opening statements, the State presented its theory that 
on the night of the incident, Beaudet-Close hit Ault in the face
so hard that he put him into a coma .  Beaudet-Close attacked 
Ault with so much force, the State argued, because he intended 
to kill Ault.  The State asserted that multiple witnesses who 
saw the attack would testify that Beaudet-Close kicked and 
punched Ault, but that Ault never struck Beaudet-Close back or 
tried to defend himself.  The State explained that Ault, who 
remained in a coma for weeks after the incident, suffered 
multiple facial fractures, a subdural hematoma, and a traumatic 
brain injury. 1
 
In Beaudet- Close’s opening statements, his counsel 
explained that Beaudet-Close was walking through a dangerous 
area where drugs were frequently sold and consumed when Ault 
approached him with a knif e and said “[w]e got shit to settle.”
Beaudet-Close argued that he acted in self-defense and did not 
intend to kill Ault.   
1. Detective Walter Ah Mow’s Testimony  
The State called retired Hawai i
 Police Department 
(HPD) Detective Walter Ah Mow (Detective Ah Mow).  Detective  
                     
1 The Honorable Melvin H. Fujino presided.   
 
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 Ah Mow worked for the Criminal Investigation Section in Kona in 
2016 and was assigned to the “assault investigation” that is the 
subject of this appeal.  He testified that Beaudet- Close became 
a person of interest after a witness identified Beaudet- Close as 
the assailant.  Detective Ah Mow stated that on November 7, 
2016, he interviewed Beaudet- Close, who had already turned 
himself in for the assault and was confined to a cellblock .  
Detective Ah Mow video recorded the interview . 
According to Detective Ah Mow, Beaudet-Close told him 
that on the night of the incident, Ault had brandished a knife.  
Detective Ah Mow testified that Beaudet- Close’s statement did 
not make sense and that he was never able to corroborate 
Beaudet-Close’s assertion that Ault had brandished a knife.  
Detective Ah Mow stated, “[t]here was no knife involved.”  
Detective Ah Mow explained that he advised Beaudet-
Close of his “rights regarding the making or not making of a 
statement . . . [and] his rights regarding an attorney” using 
the standard Hawai i Police Department Advice of Rights form 
(Advice of Rights Form). 
 Detective Ah Mow read the Advice of 
Rights Form to Beaudet-Close, who initialed it in various 
places.  Beaudet-Close’s initials and verbal statements  
indicated that he understood the Advice of Rights Form, 
that he 
waived his right to an attorney, and that he was willing to  
 
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 answer questions and to make a statement.   The State moved a 
copy of the Advice of Rights Form into evidence. 
The State then moved to place Exhibit 13A, a copy of 
the police interview video, into evidence.  Beaudet- Close 
objected as to foundation and on Hawaiʿi  Rules of Evidence (HRE) 
Rule 403  grounds.  The circuit court overruled those objections 
in the following exchange:  2
[BEAUDET- CLOSE’S COUNSEL]: Uh, just as to foundation, 
Your Honor, I don’t know – I haven’t reviewed that 
disc but otherwise that’s my objection.  
 
THE COURT: Court will receive 13A.  
 
. . . . 
 
[BEAUDET- CLOSE’S COUNSEL]: And if I could, Your 
Honor, I also object to 13A on 403 prior to 
publication.  
 
THE COURT: Overruled.  
 
The State published the video to the jury. 
2. The Police Interview Video  
The police interview video depicts Detective Ah Mow 
interviewing Beaudet- Close at the Kona Police Station on 
November 7, 2016.  First, Detective Ah Mow confirmed with 
Beaudet-Close that Beaudet-Close had turned himself in and had 
                     
2 HRE Rule 403 provides,  
 Exclusion of relevant evidence on grounds of prejudice, 
confusion, or waste of time.  Although relevant, evidence may be 
excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by 
the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or 
misleading the jury, or by considerations  of undue delay, waste 
or time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.   
 
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 reviewed the Advice of Rights Form with the detective.  Beaudet-
Close verbally waived his right to remain silent and his right 
to the presence of an attorney
, and signed the Advice of Rights 
Form, indicating that he waived those rights.  Detective Ah Mow 
informed Beaudet-Close that if he chose to answer questions, he 
had the right to stop answering questions at any time.  Beaudet-
Close stated that he was willing to answer Detective Ah Mow’s 
questions. 
Next, Detective Ah Mow showed Beaudet
-Close a photo 
lineup.  Beaudet- Close was unable to identify Ault.  Beaudet-
Close stated that on the night of the incident he was walking 
when a man said his name, said “there you are, we got some shit 
to settle,” identified himself as Ault, and lunged at Beaudet -
Close with a knife.  Beaudet-Close explained that he kicked and 
punched Ault and succeeded in kicking the knife out of Ault’s 
hand.  Beaudet-Close asserted that he did not use any weapons, 
but that he punched Ault once and kicked Ault seven to eight 
times, including two or three kicks to the head.  Beaudet
-Close 
stated that he then called the police. 
Beaudet-Close stated that he had never met Ault 
before, but that he had heard Ault was “out to look for him” 
because of Beaudet- Close’s ex -girlfriend. 
After Beaudet- Close explained the altercation and the  
 
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
8 
 events surrounding it, Detective Ah Mow requested that Beaudet-
Close participate in a video reconstruction of the altercation 
at the scene “because I want your side of the story.”  Detective 
Ah Mow explained that Beaudet- Close did not have to participate 
if he did not want to participate.  After Beaudet- Close stated 
that he was scared, Detective Ah Mow again told him that he did 
not have to participate in the reenactment.  Beaudet- Close 
continued that he was afraid for his life and for his family 
because he thought Ault’s friends might try to seek re venge.   
Detective Ah Mow stated, “[s]o how do you feel about 
doing a video reconstruction.  Like I say, we don’t have to.”  
Beaudet-Close replied, “right now I’m not comfortable with 
that.”  
 
Beaudet-Close continued that if he had known Ault 
would be at the scene of the altercation that night, he would 
have parked somewhere else and walked a different way.  
Detective Ah Mow told Beaudet- Close that he had no further 
questions and told Beaudet-Close that since the authorities were 
not sure about the extent o f Ault’s injuries, the investigation 
was still ongoing.  Beaudet- Close again expressed that he feared 
for his family.  Detective Ah Mow ended the interview. 
3. Motion for Mistrial 
On July 13, 2017, the day the jury saw the video of  
 
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
9 
 Beaudet-Close’s intervie w, Beaudet -Close filed a Motion for 
Mistrial.  Beaudet- Close argued that the admission of his 
“refusal to provide statements and cooperate in a ‘scene 
reconstruction’” in the police interview video was “plainly 
impermissible.”  Beaudet-Close asserted that the only reason the 
prosecutor would have played the portion of the video where 
Beaudet-Close refuses to participate in the scene reconstruction 
was to imply Beaudet
-Close’s guilt.  Beaudet-Close concluded 
that when “the State knowingly played for the jury  [footage of 
Beaudet-Close] choosing to invoke his right to remain silent, 
refuse [to answer] future statements and decline to participate 
in furthering the Hawaii Police Department’s investigation,” the 
State “violated [Beaudet -Close’s] rights against com pelled self-
incrimination guaranteed by article I, section 10 of the Hawaii 
Constitution.” 
At trial the following morning, the circuit court 
denied Beaudet-Close’s motion.  The circuit court observed that 
Beaudet-Close did not object to the video at the mo
tion for 
voluntariness hearing.  The circuit court then stated: 
Further, the court would find as far as State’s 
Exhibit 13A, which was received yesterday, that the 
defendant had already waived his rights, gave his 
story and towards the end of the State’s E xhibit 13A, 
the Detective is asking if he would like to do a 
reconstruction and go physically show so he can tell 
his side of the story, meaning what he just told the 
Detective.  So the court would deny the defendant’s 
motion for mistrial

 4. Beaudet -Close’s Testimony 
Beaudet-Close testified last.  Beaudet -Close testified 
that on the night of the incident, he went to the Aloha Gas 
Station near the scene of the incident at around 9:00 p.m.  
Beaudet-Close began to walk down a road near the gas station 
when someone said “[t]here you are.  We got some shit to 
settle.”  Beaudet-Close stated that the person identified 
himself as “Luke” and lunged at Beaudet -Close with a knife that 
was no more than three inches long.  Beaudet- Close testified 
that after Ault fell to the ground, “I kicked him in his stomach 
maybe two times and I noticed the knife in his hand so I kicked 
it.  And it was still in his hand, I kicked it again.  And from 
there I kicked him in his face and he stopped moving right 
there.”  Beaudet-Close stated that he feared he was still in 
danger, so he started to yell.  Beaudet-Close explained that he 
then called 911.  Beaudet
-Close testified that he left when he 
heard the police arrive because he was still scared.  Beaudet-
Close stated that he did not intend to kill Ault. 
B. Verdict and Sentencing 
On July 19, 2017, the jury found Beaudet- Close guilty 
of Attempted Murder in the Second Degree.  On September 13, 
2017, the circuit court sentenced Beaudet- Close to life in 
prison and ordered that he pay $3,041.66 in restitution.  
 
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 C. Appeal 
The ICA affirmed the circuit court’s Judgment of 
Conviction and Sentence. 
With respect to the police interview video, the ICA 
held that Beaudet- Close’s statements declining to participate in 
the reconstruction did not invoke his right to remain silent.   
The ICA distinguished the facts of this case from those of State 
v. Rodrigues, 113 Hawai i 41, 147 P.3d 825 (2006), by observing 
that in this case, Beaudet
-Close “was not refusing to speak 
further on the matter.”  The ICA conti nued, “rather than remain 
silent, [Beaudet-Close] continued to speak and explain his fear 
of returning back to the scene and his ongoing discomfort with 
the situation.”  Therefore, the ICA held, Beaudet -Close did not 
invoke his right to remain silent and the circuit court did not 
err in admitting the video.  The ICA affirmed the circuit 
court’s Judgment of Conviction and Sentence and entered its 
Judgment on Appeal on July 9, 2019. 
Beaudet-Close filed a timely Application for Writ of 
Certiorari on July 11, 2019.  In his application, Beaudet- Close 
asserts that, contrary to the ICA’s conclusion that Beaudet -
Close did not assert his right to remain silent, the Ninth 
Circuit’s holding in Hurd v. Terhune , 619 F.3d 1080 (9th Cir. 
2010) makes clear that when police request that a suspect *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
12 reenact an incident, the suspect’s refusal is an unambiguous 
invocation of the right to remain silent.  Beaudet- Close 
continues that the facts of this case are even worse than those 
of Hurd because in Hurd the prosecutor merely made references to 
the defendant’s refusal to reenact the incident, but here, the 
prosecutor played a video of Beaudet -Close refusing to reenact 
the altercation before the jury.  Therefore, Beaudet-Close 
concludes, “[t]his visual is equally, if not more, prejud icial 
to [Beaudet-Close’s] constitutional right to remain silent.”  
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
A. Constitutional Issues
“Issues of constitutional interpretation present 
questions of law that are reviewed de novo.”  Sierra Club v. 
Dep’t of Transp. of State of Hawaii, 120 Hawai i 181, 196, 202 
P.3d 1226, 1241 (2009).
III. DISCUSSION
We hold that Beaudet- Close unambiguously invoked his 
right to remain silent  when he declined Detective Ah Mow’s 3
 Both the United States Constitution and the Hawai i Constitution protect 3 
a criminal defendant’s privilege against self-incrimination, or “right to 
remain silent.”  See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 444 (1966).  
The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides:  “No person 
shall . . . be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against 
himself[.]”  U.S. Const. amend. V.  
Likewise, ar ticle 1, section 10 of the Hawai‘i Constitution states, “nor 
shall any person be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against 
oneself.”  Haw. Const. art. 1 § 10.   
 
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
13 
 request that Beaudet- Close participate in a reenactment of the 
incident.  Moreover, consistent with this court’s holding in 
State v. Domingo, 69 Haw. 68, 733 P.2d 690 (1987), Beaudet-
Close’s privilege against self -incrimination was infringed when, 
over his objection, the circuit court permitted the jury to view 
a video of Beaudet-Close invoking that privilege. 
A. Beaudet -Close invoked his right to remain silent when 
 he refused to participate in the reenactment. 
  
Beaudet-Close argues that the ICA erred in concluding 
that Beaudet-Close’s decision not to participate in the 
reenactment did not constitute an invocation of his right to 
remain silent.   This assessment is correct as a matter of 
federal law.  See Hurd, 619 F.3d 1080.   4
In Hurd, the United States Court of Appeals for the 
                     
Hawai i The ICA held that, under Rodrigues, 113  at 49, 147 P.3d at 833, 4 
Beaudet- Close did not invoke his right to remain silent because he was not 
“refusing to speak further on the matter.”  However, the ICA’s application of 
Rodrigues
 was incorrect.  In holding that a defendant’s refusal to repeat his 
statement on tape was an invocation of his right to remain silent, the 
Rodrigues court explained that  
  
when the questioning of a suspect is otherwise complete, 
and the police request that the suspect reiterate his or 
her statement in order to memorialize it electronically, 
the suspect’s  refusal to do so amounts to an invocation of 
the right to remain silent precisely because the suspect is 
refusing to speak further on the matter.  
 
Id.  
Here, Detective Ah Mow ceased questioning after Beaudet- Close stated 
that he did not want to go back over his statement by reenacting it.  
Beaudet- Close continued to speak, but only about his fear for himself and his 
family.  Therefore, under the Rodrigues analysis, Beaudet -Close invoke d his 
right to remain silent.    
 
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 Ninth Circuit (Ninth Circuit) analyzed the p rosecution’s use at 
trial of defendant Hurd’s refusal to participate in a 
reenactment of how he shot his wife.  619 F.3d at 1082.  There, 
police took Hurd into custody after his wife was killed in a 
shooting at his home.  Id.  at 1083.  Hurd expressed his 
willingness to speak to police without an attorney, to answer 
detectives’ questions, and to give his side of what had 
happened.  Id.  Hurd explained that he had offered to lend his 
gun to his estranged wife, but that it had accidentally 
discharged while he attempted to load it for her.  Id.   When 
detectives asked Hurd to reenact how the shooting had occurred, 
Hurd refused.  Id. at 1084.  The Ninth Circuit held that  
Hurd unambiguously invoked his right to silence  when 
the officers requested that he reenact the shooting 
[and] Hurd responded to the officers’ requests by 
saying, among other things, “I don’t want to do 
that,” “No,” “I can’t,” and “I don’t want to act it 
out because that – it’s not that clear.”    
 
Id. at 1088- 89 (emphasis added).  Because “a suspect may invoke 
his right to silence at any time during questioning and that [] 
silence cannot be used against him at trial,” id. at 1087, the 
Ninth Circuit held that the prosecutor’s reference to Hurd’s 
invocation of his right to silence was not harmless.  Id. at 
1090.  The Ninth Circuit therefore vacated Hurd’s conviction.  
Id. at 1091. 
Applying the Hurd  analysis to this case, Beaudet- Close  
 
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
15 
 clearly invoked his right to remain silent when he refused to 
participate in a reenactment of Ault’s beating.  Here, Beaudet -
Close turned himself in to police as the perpetrator of Ault’s 
beating.  In custody, Beaudet- Close waived his right to an 
attorney and agreed to answer questions and provide his side of 
the story.  After Beaudet- Close provided his statement and 
answered Detective Ah Mow’s questions, Detective Ah Mow asked 
Beaudet-Close if he would return to the scene of the incident to 
reenact the events that had transpired.  Beaudet-Clo se stated 
that he did not feel comfortable doing so and explained that he 
was scared.  Detective Ah Mow again asked Beaudet-Close if he 
would reenact the events and Beaudet-Close again said that he 
would not, because he was scared.  At that point, Detective Ah 
Mow ended the interview.   Pursuant to the Hurd analysis, 
Beaudet-Close invoked his right to silence when he refused to 
reenact the incident.  See  Hurd, 619 F.3d at 1088-89.  5
Because we are persuaded by the Ninth Circuit’s 
interpretation in Hurd , we hold that a suspect’s refusal to 
reenact the incident for which the suspect is in custody is an 
unambiguous invocation of the suspect’s  right to remain silent.  
Beaudet-Close invoked his right to remain silent when he 
                     
5 That Detective Ah Mow ceased questioning when Beaudet -Close declined to 
participate in the reenactment might indicate that Detective Ah Mow 
considered that refusal an invocation of Beaudet -Close’s right to remain 
silent.  
 
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
16 
 repeatedly indicated to Detective Ah Mow that he did not wish to 
reenact his altercation with Ault. 
B. Beaudet-Close’s right to remain silent was infringed  
 when video footage of him invoking that right was 
 shown, over his objection, to the jury. 
 
Beaudet-Close argues that his invocation of his right 
to remain silent was impermissibly used against him at trial 
when the prosecutor played before the jury a video of him 
invoking that right. 
Article 1, section 10 of the Hawai i Constitution, 
which states “nor shall any person be compelled in any criminal 
case to be a witness against oneself[,]” provides for a criminal 
defendant’s right to remain silent.  Haw. Const. art 1 ,
 § 10.  
We have held that “[a] concomitant of the right t o remain silent 
is the prohibition on the prosecution from commenting on a 
person’s exercise of that right.”  Tsujimura, 140 Hawai i at 314, 
400 P.3d at 515.  As such, “the prosecution may not comment on a 
defendant’s failure to testify.”  State v. Wakisaka, 102 Hawai i 
504, 514, 78 P.3d 317, 327 (2003). 
In State v. Domingo, this court analyzed when the 
introduction of evidence showing that a defendant invoked 
certain constitutional rights infringes upon those rights.  69 
Haw. at 69, 733 P.2d at 691.  There, we held that “[t]he 
introduction, over objection, of evidence that as [sic]  
 
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
17 
 defendant had invoked his rights under Sections 10 and 14 of 
Article 1 of the Constitution of the State of Hawaii, where 
there was no issue as to whether the defendant had done so, 
would infringe on those rights.”  Id. (citing Doyle v. Ohio, 426 
U.S. 610 (1976)).  We went on to explain that the introduction 
of this evidence would infringe the defendant’s right to remain 
silent because a jury would likely infer the defendant’s guil t 
from his invocation of his right.  Id. at 70, 733 P.2d at 691-
92. 
In Domingo, the defendant signed an Advice of Rights 
Form, which was introduced as evidence.  Id. at 69, 733 P.2d at 
691.  The sections where the defendant had invoked his 
constitutional rights were redacted.  Id.  Nevertheless, this 
court held that given the context of the rest of the evidence, 
the jury could and probably did infer that the defendant had 
invoked his constitutional rights.  Id. at 70, 733 P.2d at 691-
92.  In other words, in a situation where the prosecution 
publishes evidence that a defendant has invoked the right to 
remain silent, the controlling inquiry is whether or not the 
jury would infer from that evidence that the defendant invoked 
that right.  If the jury can make such an inference, the 
prosecutor has impermissibly used silence against the defendant

 at trial.   6
The introduction of the police interview video 
infringed Beaudet-Close’s right to remain silent under the 
Domingo test.  The jury was shown the portion of the video in 
which Beaudet-Close refused to participate in the reenactment.  
The jury was not told that Beaudet-Close’s refusal to reenact 
the incident constituted an invocation of his right to remain 
silent.  However, like in 
Domingo, it is likely that the jury 
inferred from seeing this video that Beaudet- Close invoked this 
right, because up until the moment Beaudet- Close declined to 
cooperate with the reenactment, Beaudet -Close had answered all 
of Detective Ah Mow’s questions.  Even if the jury did not infer 
that Beaudet-Close officially invoked his right to remain 
silent, the jury could have nevertheless made the inference, 
based on Beaudet-Close’s refusal to cooperate with Detective Ah 
Mow in this way, that Beaudet- Close was hiding something.  
                     
6 The Domingo court held that the introduction of evidence that a 
defendant has invoked his right to remain silent infringes that right.  69 
Haw. at 69, 733 P.2d at 691.  However, the Domingo  court proceeded to analyze 
the introduction of that evidence under the HRE Rule 403 probative value  
versus prejudicial effect  balancing test.  Id.  at 70, 733 P.2d at 691 -92.  
The court stated that if the jury can infer that the defendant invoked his 
constitutional rights, the likelihood that the jury will make an 
impermissible inference therefrom far outweighs the probative value of the 
evidence.  Id.  The Domingo  court therefore held that the introduction of the 
evidence was an abuse of discretion under HRE Rule 403.  Id.  
It appears that after implying that the d efendant’s constitutional 
right was infringed, the Domingo court did not need to address the HRE Rule 
403 test.  However, either inquiry results in the same conclusion  - that the
introduction of the subject evidence at trial necessitated vacating the  
defendant’s conviction.

Beaudet-Close’s right to remain silent was infringed because his 
decision not to testify against himself by reenacting the 
incident was used against him at trial. 
IV.  CONCLUSION 
Beaudet-Close’s right to remain silent was infringed 
when video footage of his invocation of that right was published 
to the jury over his objection.  The jury likely inferred from 
the video that Beaudet- Close invoked his right to remain silent 
when he refused to participate in a reenactment of the incident 
at the close of his interview.  Therefore, pursuant to the 
standard we set forth in Domingo, Beaudet- Close’s invocation of 
his right to remain silent was used against him at trial in 
violation of article 1, section 10 of the Hawai i Constitution. 
We vacate the ICA’s July 9, 2019, Judgment on Appeal, 
which affirmed the circuit court’s September 13, 2017, Judgment 
of Conviction and Sentence and remand for a new trial.
