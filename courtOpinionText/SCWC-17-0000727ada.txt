OPINION OF THE COURT BY EDDINS, J. 
 
The prosecution injected victim impact evidence into Ralph 
Riveira’s burglary trial.  And during opening statement and 
closing argument, the State spotlighted the crime’s effect on 
the burglarized family.  It also told the jurors that defense 
counsel tried to “trick” them. Electronically Filed

 The prosecution’s narrative arc focused on the victims’ 
emotional state and actions after the crime.  This constituted 
prosecutorial misconduct.  So did the comment besmirching 
defense counsel.  But the evidence overwhelmingly established 
Riveira’s guilt.  We conclude that the misconduct was harmless 
and affirm Riveira’s conviction.1   
I. 
A burglary happened at a Kailua house.
  The homeowner 
returned home.  She saw a man running in her backyard.  He was 
carrying a black object with black cords hanging from it.  The 
homeowner ran after him to get “a good visual.”  She did not see 
his face.  But she had an unobstructed view of the man from 
about twenty-five feet.  The fleeing man was heavy-set and had 
short hair.  He wore a neon green construction shirt, dark 
boots, and plaid shorts.  The man hopped the backyard fence. 
The homeowner later realized that her laptop and her 
children’s gaming devices were taken.  A towel she had laid on the floor for her dog had a boot print. 
                                                 
1  Riveira also challenges the ICA’s holding that (1) the circuit court 
did not err by denying his motion to suppress field show- up identifications; 
(2) the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in admitting a full- body 
arrest photograph of Riveira and another photograph of him found in a truck 
connected to the burglary; and (3) the circuit court did not err by 
instructing the jury on accomplice liability.  We do not find error in the 
ICA’s analysis covering these issues.  Riveira’s allegations of improper 
statements by the prosecution that are not addressed here also lack merit .  
We consider Riveira’s claim that the trial court plainly erred in allowing 
the burglarized family’s impact testimony as part of the prosecutorial 
misconduct analysis.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 After the burglar jumped the fence, the homeowner called 
911.  She described “what [the man] looked like, what he was 
wearing, and what he was carrying.”  
The homeowner also told the 911 operator about a red Toyota 
Tundra parked by her mailbox.  She recited the truck’s license 
plate number.  And she relayed that a woman was sitting inside
.  
The woman’s feet rested on the dashboard; her toenails were painted.  Shortly after, the truck left.  
Within ten minutes, the police stopped a red Toyota Tundra 
about a mile and a half from the burglarized home.  The truck matched the license plate number given by the homeowner.  
Riveira sat in the front passenger seat.  The truck’s owner, a 
woman with painted toenails, was the driver.
2  Both were 
arrested.  The police impounded the truck and got a search warrant.  
About ten minutes before the burglary’s end, the 
homeowner’s neighbor spotted a similar Toyota Tundra parked on a nearby street.  He told the police he saw a man sitting in the 
truck.  The neighbor had “a clear visual.”  The man had short 
hair and wore a yellow construction shirt.  They made eye 
contact; the man gave him a shaka.  About five minutes later, 
                                                 
2  The female driver died before trial.  T he court read a stipulation to 
the jury:  “. . . [ The driver] has passed away.  Her passing is in no way 
related to this case in any way whatsoever.”  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 the neighbor saw the truck again.  This time it drove down his 
and the homeowner’s street.
 
After Riveira’s detention, the police drove the homeowner 
and neighbor separately to Riveira’s location for a field show-
up.  Both identified Riveira as the man they had seen.  At 
trial, the homeowner testified: “[h]e was wearing the same plaid 
shorts, he had the same build, he had the same [dark boots].”  
She said, “[t]he only thing [that] was different [at the field show-up] was [Riveira’s] shirt; he was not wearing the 
construction neon shirt.”  The neighbor identified Riveira 
partly based on his tattoos.  The homeowner identified the 
female driver as the woman in the truck by her mailbox; the 
toenails matched.  
The police recovered the stolen property – a black laptop 
with a black cord and gaming devices - from the impounded truck.  
Officers also retrieved Riveira’s photograph from a bag in the 
truck.  
At trial, the homeowner and neighbor testified.
3  They 
detailed their encounters with the suspect and the truck.  They also discussed how they identified Riveira.  Police officers 
testified about the arrest, field show-ups, and truck search.  
The jury viewed scene photographs depicting Riveira, the home,

 the truck, and the stolen property found in it.
 
The prosecution’s trial narrative featured evidence and 
remarks about the crime’s impact on the homeowner’s family.  The 
prosecution bookended its case with commentary regarding this 
impact.  During opening statement, the deputy prosecuting 
attorney previewed the case: “[T]his is a case about a Kailua 
family who was burglarized.  And more so than just losing 
electronics, the evidence will show that they lost their sense 
of security and ability to feel safe in their home. . . .”  
(Emphasis added.)   
 During the State’s rebuttal closing argument, the 
prosecuting attorney showcased the victim impact evidence he had presented.  The State’s argument ended with a plea to convict 
Riveira for what he had done to the family:    
Do you remember what [the homeowner] said about this whole 
experience?  It’s affected me deeply.  It’s affected me 
deeply.  You know, the evidence does show they got the 
electronics back.  She still uses the laptop.  The kids still play with the Nintendo devices.  But more than 
electronics, the defendant took something else from them 
that they didn’t get back, that’s the ability to feel safe 
and secure in their own home.  
For most people, burglary is just something that happens to 
other people until it happens to them, and in this case it 
happened to the [family].  [The homeowner] had the 
unfortunate experience of interrupting the defendant in the middle of burglarizing her home, but she had the fortunate circumstance of having the sound mind to immediately 
realize it and do her best to get a description of the 
defendant, to get a description of the vehicle he would use 
to get away, to even get a description of the black object 
with the cord in his arms as he ran away.  And, again, look 
at all the photos of the interior of that truck taken on 
February 24th, 2012, when they execute the search warrant, 
and you will see the only item in that truck that is black 
with a cord hanging off is her laptop.  You saw [ the *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 homeowner] testify.  The [family was] not trespassed, they 
were burglarized. 
Ladies and gentlemen, I ask that you hold the defendant 
accountable for what he did to that family and find him 
guilty as charged of Burglary in the First Degree. 
(Emphases added.) 
 The State called the eyewitness homeowner’s husband to 
testify.  He wasn’t home during the crime.  The deputy 
prosecuting attorney asked a few questions relating to consent; 
the burglar did not have permission to enter or take any 
property from the family home.  The prosecuting attorney then 
asked: “how did it make you feel after you had learned that you had been burglarized?”  “Violated,” he told the jury.  Defense 
counsel failed to object. 
 The prosecution similarly questioned the homeowner about 
how the burglary affected her:      
[Prosecuting Attorney:] . . .[H]ow did it make you feel 
having your home burglarized on February 17th, 2012? 
 
[Homeowner:]  Very violated.  I’ m a mother of children, and 
to have someone in my home, where my children sleep, this 
person has been in my property, and it's a very personal 
feeling, and I had a hard time sleeping afterwards.  I was 
very concerned for my safety, for the safety of my family.  And to this day I make sure that I put all electronics -- before I leave the home, I make sure I hide them because of 
-- of this occurrence.  So it's affected me deeply.
 
 
Defense counsel again failed to object.  He later cross-examined 
the homeowner about the crime’s impact.4     
                                                 
4  Defense counsel’s questions included:  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
7 
   Defense counsel objected to the prosecution’s remarks 
relating to victim impact evidence only once, 
after the State’s 
rebuttal closing argument.  At the bench, counsel objected “to 
the last couple of sentences” in the State’s rebuttal argument.  
These sentences seemingly relate to the prosecutor’s plea to 
hold Riveira accountable for what he did to the family.  The 
court overruled the objection.  
Defense counsel asked the court to reconsider its ruling, 
advancing a broader argument that the prosecuting attorney “went to the passion of the jury by saying imagine how [the homeowner 
felt] based upon what had happened, not about the items that 
were taken, [but] about . . . [the family’s] security.”  The 
prosecuting attorney denied making any “suggestion to the jury 
to place themselves in the [homeowners’] shoes.”
5  The court 
                                                 
• “Like you just testified, it's not a good feeling to go 
home where you're supposed to be safe and secure, 
correct?”;  
 
• “I bet you that even when -- for example, when you hear 
a noise, you start looking out, right, you start getting a feeling, right, that maybe somebody's here, right?”;  
 
• “So is it safe to say that sometime time -- you know, 
when they say time heals a broken heart, that passage of 
time actually makes things a little bit better?”; and 
 
• “And passage of time makes you look back and reflect as 
to what actually happened and makes you have a better 
sense of what actually occurred; isn't that right?”  
5  The prosecuting attorney mentioned that during closing argument defense 
counsel had stated “imagine how they felt. ”  Indeed defense counsel told the 
jury, “Imagine yourself in [the homeowner’s] position driving home with 
children in your van.”  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
8 
 affirmed its ruling.  It believed that the jury instructions, 
including a command to avoid being influenced by passion or 
prejudice, would ensure fairness.6  
“Wasn’t me” was Riveira’s defense.  It was a case of 
misidentification, he argued.  Riveira did not testify.  Through 
cross-examination, Riveira hoped to undermine the homeowner and 
neighbor’s identifications.  He also questioned the State’s 
police officer witnesses regarding the burglary investigation, field show-up procedures, and truck search.  Highlighting the 
lack of fingerprint evidence, the defense stressed in closing 
argument the absence of direct evidence showing that Riveira 
entered the home.   
The deputy prosecuting attorney questioned defense 
counsel’s truthfulness during rebuttal argument.  He told the 
jury: “the folks [defense counsel is] trying to trick are you 
                                                 
 
6  Before the parties’ closing arguments, the court read a series of jury 
instructions, including:   
• “Statements or arguments made by lawyers are not evidence. You 
should consider their arguments to you, but you are not bound 
by their memory or interpretation of the evidence.”;  
• “Keep in mind, however, that closing arguments are not 
evidence, okay.  What the attorneys say in closing arguments 
do not constitute evidence, all right.”; and  
• “You must not be influenced by pity for the defendant or by 
passion or prejudice against the defendant.”  
 9 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
with his interpretation of the evidence.”
   
 
Defense counsel failed to object.(Emphasis added.)7
The jury found Riveira guilty of burglary in the first 
degree.    8
II. 
Riveira challenges several remarks the deputy prosecuting 
attorney made during closing argument.  Prosecutorial 
misconduct, he contends, necessitates vacating his conviction.  We find two instances worthy of review: (1) the prosecuting 
attorney’s references to the burglary’s impact on the 
homeowner’s household, followed by a plea to hold Riveira 
accountable “for what he did to that family”; and (2) the 
prosecuting attorney’s comment accusing defense counsel of 
trickery.   
The State concedes that these remarks were improper.
9  But 
it argues that they were not reversible prosecutorial 
7The prosecuting attorney prefaced his remark by referring to defense 
counsel’s comment to two prosecution witnesses during cross
-examination that 
he wasn’t trying to trick them.   
8The court instructed the jury that it could convict Riveira as a 
principal or accomplice.  The court did not give a special
 interrogatory.  So 
whether the jury convicted him as a principal or accomplice is unknown.  On 
appeal, Riveira argued that the evidence failed to support an accomplice 
instruction.  We agree with the ICA.  It did.   
9During oral argument, the State acknowledged: “When we come to the 
victim impact testimony, I think it’s pretty clear that we shouldn’t be 
bringing this out in the case in chief or . . . before the jury.  I do find that [it] . . . would be irrelevant; it is prejudicial.”  The State also 
recognized that the prosecutor’s insinuation that defense counsel attempted 
to trick the jury was “something that [prosecutors] shouldn’t be doing.”  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
10 
 misconduct.  We agree.  
Allegations of prosecutorial misconduct are reviewed under 
the harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard.  State v. 
Klinge, 92 Hawaiʻ i 577, 584, 994 P.2d 509, 516 (2000).  After 
considering the nature of the prosecuting attorney’s conduct, 
promptness or lack of a curative instruction, and strength or 
weakness of the evidence against the defendant, a reviewing 
court will vacate a conviction if there is a reasonable 
possibility that the conduct might have affected the trial’s 
outcome.  State v. Senteno, 69 Haw. 363, 366, 742 P.2d 369, 372 
(1987) (citing State v. Marsh, 68 Haw. 659, 661, 728 P.2d 1301, 
1303 (1986)); State v. Rogan, 91 Hawaiʻ i 405, 412, 984 P.2d 1231, 
1238 (1999).10   
The nature of the challenged conduct – what it was and how 
it entwined with the whole case – starts the inspection.  
Beginning with the first allegation of prosecutorial misconduct, 
injecting victim impact evidence into the trial and touting that 
evidence to hold the defendant accountable for what he did to 
the victim’s family amounted to severe misconduct.   
                                                 
10  If a defendant fails to object to a prosecutor’s improper conduct, 
“appellate review is limited to a determination of whether the prosecutor's 
alleged misconduct amounted to plain error” that affected the defendant’s 
substantial rights.  State v. Iuli, 101 Hawaiʻ i 196, 204, 65 P.3d 143, 151 
(2003).  In determining plain error relating to prosecutorial misconduct, 
courts have considered the same three factors.  Id. at 208, 65 P.3d at 155.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
11 
 Victim impact evidence concerns a crime’s effect on the 
person harmed by the crime or others, especially the person’s 
family members.  It includes evidence regarding the physical, 
psychological, or economic effect of a crime.  See Hawai‘ i 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 706-602(1)(c) (2014) (instructing that 
victim impact statements in the sentencing context include “any 
physical or psychological harm or financial loss suffered”).   
During a trial, a crime’s after-effects are rarely allowed.   
Hawai‘i Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rules 401, 403.11  In State v. 
Lora, 147 Hawaiʻ i 298, 307-09, 465 P.3d 745, 754-56 (2020), this 
court disallowed victim impact evidence to counteract a cross-
examination undermining a witness’s credibility.  “We reject[ed] 
an approach that would permit the admissibility of the impacts 
of an alleged offense on a complaining witness in order to 
bolster the witness's credibility after it has been impeached or 
attacked.”  Id. at 309, 465 P.3d at 756.  While observing that 
impact evidence is generally irrelevant to a defendant’s guilt, 
we recognized that establishing an element of a crime could 
                                                 
11   Sentencing hearings, by contrast, routinely feature victim impact 
testimony.  HRS §§ 706-602(1)(c), 706– 604(3) ( Supp. 2016).  “The victim 
impact statement is often made a part of the [presentence report] and the 
victim or the victim’ s family is given the opportunity to be heard in open 
court at the hearing itself.”  State v. Hussein, 122 Hawaiʻ i 495, 523, 229 
P.3d 313, 341 (2010).    
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
12 justify the prosecution’s introduction of the evidence.  Id. at
309, n.14, 465 P.3d at 756, n.14.   
12
Here, the prosecution’s narrative arc promoted evidence 
spotlighting the crime’s impact on the homeowner’s family.  The 
prosecution flanked its case with commentary regarding the 
burglary’s aftermath.  During opening statement, the deputy 
prosecuting attorney introduced the theme: “the evidence will 
show that [the family] lost their sense of security and ability 
to feel safe in their home.” 
To back its promise, the prosecution asked the eyewitness 
homeowner how the burglary made her feel.  She felt “very 
violated,” experienced a “very personal feeling” because the 
burglary happened in her home where her children slept, was 
“very concerned” for her family’s safety, had difficulties 
sleeping, and hid the family’s electronics when she left home.  
She ended her answer by saying that the crime “affected [her] 
deeply.” 
The prosecution also called the homeowner’s husband to 
testify.  The State asked 
him a few questions about consent, 
12See Hartwell v. State, 476 S.W.3d 523, 535 (Tex. Ct. App. 2015) 
(holding that questions regarding the extent of the victim’s injuries were 
relevant because the state had to prove that she suffered serious bodily 
injury and the questions did not address the effect of the crime on the victim or her family).   Impeaching a victim’s credibility is another purpose 
justifying victim impact evidence.  See Lora, 147 Hawaiʻ i
 at 309, n.14, 465 
P.3d at 756, n.14 (observing that impact evidence can be introduced at trial
“to impeach a victim’s credibility”).  Like all evidence, this purpose must
satisfy HRE Rules 401 and 403.*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
13 
 though the homeowner later established the same point.  The 
deputy prosecuting attorney then asked
, “how did it make you 
feel after you had learned that you had been burglarized?”  “Violated,” he told the jury.  
At the trial’s end, the prosecuting attorney circled to the 
opening statement’s preview regarding what the case was about – 
a family’s inability to feel safe and secure in their home.  
Then, after briefly recapping the evidence, the State had the last word; it urged the jury to “hold the defendant accountable 
for what he did to that family and find him guilty as charged of 
Burglary in the First Degree.” 
The victim impact testimony presented and highlighted by 
the prosecution lacked probative value.  Riveira claimed he was 
misidentified.  The prosecution said he was not.  The 
homeowners’ post-event feelings and actions did not help prove 
an element.  The crime’s aftermaths did not have a tendency to 
make a fact of consequence more or less probable.  HRE Rule 401
13 
should have blocked the testimony.   
  The victim impact testimony’s highly prejudicial nature
                                                 
13  HRE Rule 401 reads: “‘Relevant evidence’ means evidence having any 
tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the 
determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be 
without the evidence.”  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
14 
 also made it inadmissible under HRE Rule 403.   The evidence 
generated sympathy for the family and impelled hostility toward 
Riveira.  See HRE Rule 403 cmt. (recognizing “potential for 
engendering juror prejudice, hostility, or sympathy” as a factor
in Rule 403 determinations).  The need for the victim impact 
evidence was nil.  By contrast, the testimony had great 
potential to unfairly prejudice Riveira.  14
 
Complicating the case slightly, the defense failed to make 
evidentiary objections.15  This mattered to the ICA.  Because 
admitting the victim impact testimony from the eyewitness 
homeowner and her husband was not plainly erroneous, the ICA 
determined, the deputy prosecuting attorney’s “brief” comment 
about the testimony during closing argument was not reversible 
prosecutorial misconduct.  Although we agree with the ultimate 
                                                 
14  HRE Rule 403 reads: “Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its 
probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair 
prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by 
considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of 
cumulative evidence.” 
15  The ICA observed that the State did not directly rebut the defense’s 
appellate argument maintaining that the victim impact testimony was 
irrelevant and highly prejudicial.  Instead, the State argued — and the ICA 
agreed — that admitting the impact testimony did not amount to plain error 
because it was “a result of trial strategy.”   Although we agree that 
admitting the irrelevant testimony was not plainly erroneous, w e disagree 
with the ICA’s rationale.   The ICA concentrated on defense counsel’ s decision 
to ask the homeowner questions about the burglary’s impact during cross-examination.  It believed the failure to object was a conscious decision, 
designed to challenge the reliability of the homeowner’s identification.  
This reasoning is unpersuasive.  Defense counsel’s meandering cross-
examination questions about the burglary’s impact, see supra n.4, didn’t 
touch the homeowner’s identification.  And it makes little sense that defense 
counsel strategically greenlighted highly prejudicial testimony so that he 
could query the victim about that highly prejudicial testimony.     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
15 
 conclusion, this determination understated the centrality that 
the inadmissible victim impact
 testimony played in the State’s 
case.  
When reviewing the nature of prosecutorial misconduct, 
courts should inspect how the prosecution entwined its improper conduct within the case’s contextual fabric.  See State v. 
Uyesugi, 100 Hawaiʻ i 442, 460, 60 P.3d 843, 861 (2002) (focusing 
in part on “whether and how [surviving family members’] 
testimony was woven into the case” when analyzing whether the 
testimony “inflame[d] the jury to the extent that the jury [was] 
diverted from its objective considerations”).     
Here, the prosecution previewed, injected, and highlighted 
how the burglary affected the homeowner’s family.  Asking the jury to hold Riveira accountable for what he did “to that 
family” did not merely conjure up the evidence about the 
burglary.  The prosecution’s entreaty likely evoked an emotional 
reaction from the jury; it emphasized the crime’s effect on the 
family.  The way the State infused the irrelevant impact 
evidence into its case and rebuttal argument amplified the 
evidence’s prejudicial effect.  See Lora, 147 Hawaiʻ i at 310-11, 
465 P.3d at 757-58 (“The admission of [the erroneously admitted] 
testimony, the manner in which it was presented by the 
[prosecution], and the reliance upon it during closing argument all demonstrate that this error was highly prejudicial.”).  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
16 
  The second instance of prosecutorial misconduct happened 
when the deputy prosecuting attorney denounced defense counsel 
for trying to deceive the jury: “the folks [defense counsel is] 
trying to trick are you with his interpretation of the 
evidence.”  (Emphasis added.)  The ICA downplayed the prosecution’s conduct; it deemed the error “not of a repeated 
nature.”   
Impugning defense counsel’s principles is serious 
misconduct.  It undermines a trial’s fairness “because it is a strik[e] at the [defendant] over the shoulders of his counsel in 
an attempt to prejudice the jury against the [defendant].”  
State v. Underwood, 142 Hawaiʻ i 317, 327, 418 P.3d 658, 668 
(2018) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also 
State v. Pasene, 144 Hawaiʻ i 339, 370, 439 P.3d 864, 895 (2019) 
(“A prosecutor’s comment is clearly misconduct where it 
constitutes an impermissible attack on defense counsel’s 
integrity and operates to denigrate the legal profession in 
general.” (cleaned up)).  Accusing defense counsel of trying to 
“trick” the jury fits this mold.16  
We conclude that both sets of improper remarks amounted to 
serious misconduct.   
                                                 
16  Defense counsel’s offhand references during cross- examination of two 
prosecution witnesses that he was not trying to trick them, see supra n.7, do 
not validate a declaration to the jury that counsel was trying to manipulate 
them.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
17 
 Next, under the second factor examining claims of 
reversible prosecutorial misconduct, we consider whether the 
court gave prompt curative instructions.  
Here, the trial court 
did not give curative instructions.  The defense did not object to the inadmissible victim impact evidence; it also did not 
object to the “trick” comment.  A curative instruction’s 
probability drops without an objection.  An instruction would 
only be given if the trial court stepped in.  But like here, trial courts often do not intercede.  Because the putative 
misconduct lingers unimpeded by objection and curing, the second 
factor rewards sloppy defense work; it seemingly makes a 
successful appeal easier in a plain error prosecutorial 
misconduct case.   
Even if the defense had objected and the court had given a 
mitigating instruction, the instruction would not have remedied 
the misconduct’s prejudicial effects.  Court instructions often 
serve as an unsatisfactory, ineffectual fix when prejudicial matters surface at trial.  See Krulewitch v. United States, 336 
U.S. 440, 453 (1949) (Jackson, J., concurring) (citation omitted) (“The naive assumption that prejudicial effects can be 
overcome by instructions to the jury . . . [is] unmitigated 
fiction.”). 
The State argued that the trial court’s general 
instructions, like directing the jury not to be influenced by *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 passion or prejudice, cured any prejudice caused by the 
prosecuting attorney’s improper remarks.  We disagree.  The 
general instructions given to Riveira’s jury before closing 
arguments did not neutralize the prosecutor’s harmful conduct.  
See Underwood, 142 
Hawaiʻi at 327-28, 418 P.3d at 668-69 (holding 
that an instruction stating, “[s]tatements or remarks made by 
counsel are not evidence,” was “an ineffective remedy to the 
improper remarks” partly because it was general in nature and 
was delivered to the jury along with many other standard 
instructions before closing arguments began).   
The case’s resolution then pivots on the strength of the 
evidence showing Riveira’s guilt.  “When evidence is so overwhelming as to outweigh the inflammatory effect of the 
improper comments, reviewing courts will regard the impropriety 
as ultimately harmless.”  State v. Williams, ___ Hawaiʻ i ___, 491 
P.3d 592, 607 (2021) (citation omitted).  We conclude that the 
evidence against Riveira was sufficiently overwhelming.  There 
was no reasonable possibility that the misconduct contributed to 
the trial’s outcome.   
Two eyewitnesses placed Riveira at or near the burglarized 
home minutes before and after the burglary.  The homeowner saw 
the burglar running away in her backyard.  She also saw a red 
Toyota Tundra truck parked next to her mailbox.  She described 
the suspect and the truck to the 911 operator.  At trial, the *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 homeowner detailed the burglar’s physical features (his heavy-
set body and short hair).  She also remembered his distinctive 
attire (a neon construction shirt, plaid shorts, and dark 
boots).  She later identified Riveira at the field show-up as 
the person she saw running in her backyard based on his heavy-
set build, plaid shorts, and dark boots.  The homeowner told the 
jury that she saw a boot print in her house after the burglary.  
The neighbor largely corroborated the homeowner’s 
testimony.  He said that he spotted a red Toyota Tundra truck and a man sitting in it about ten minutes before the homeowner 
saw the burglar.  He described the suspect as having short hair 
and wearing a yellow construction shirt, similar to what the 
homeowner observed.  The neighbor later identified Riveira 
partly based on his tattoos.  The jury saw Riveira’s arrest 
photograph.  It fairly matched both eyewitnesses’ descriptions.17  
The State presented other evidence connecting Riveira to 
the crime.  The homeowner saw the burglar carrying a black 
object with cords hanging from it.  The stolen items - the 
homeowner’s black laptop with its cord and her children’s gaming 
                                                 
17  We recognize the perils of eyewitness identifications.  See State v. 
Kaneaiakala, 145 Hawaiʻ i 231, 233, 450 P.3d 761, 763 (2019) (quoting United 
States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 228 (1967)) (observing that “[t ]he vagaries of 
eyewitness identification are well- known; [and] the annals of criminal law 
are rife with instances of mistaken identification”).  Here, the trial court 
directed the jury to determine “whether an eyewitness gave accurate testimony 
regarding identification”; it instructed the jury based on Hawaiʻ i Pattern 
Jury Instruction - Criminal 3.19, listing thirteen factors to consider in 
evaluating identification testimony.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 devices - were found in the truck that the police stopped.  The 
police did so because its license plate matched the alphanumeric 
information recited by the homeowner.  Riveira was in that 
truck, along with the female suspect.  And officers recovered 
his photograph from the truck.  After reviewing the record, we 
conclude that the State presented overwhelming evidence 
establishing Riveira’s guilt.   
Serious prosecutorial misconduct invaded Riveira’s trial.  
But considering the strength of the evidence against Riveira, we 
hold that the misconduct had no reasonable possibility of 
contributing to his conviction.  The misconduct was harmless 
beyond a reasonable doubt.18

18  The defense failed to object to the comment disparaging defense 
counsel.  So it is reviewed for plain error.  Because we hold that this 
remark was harmless, it cannot be plain error.  See State v. Ui, 142 Hawaiʻ i 
287, 297, 418 P.3d 628, 638 (2018) (internal quotation omitted) (observing 
that “a reviewing court has discretion to correct plain error when the error 
is not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt”).
