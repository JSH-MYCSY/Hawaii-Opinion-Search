 conference at which the oral motion to dismiss was made and 
granted.   
  
For the reasons discussed, we hold that the circuit 
court abused its discretion in granting the defendant’s oral 
motion to dismiss with prejudice because the record does not 
provide a valid basis for the dismissal order,  and the court 
failed to make the requisite findings of fact that would be 
required to support 
such an order  in any event.   We also 
reaffirm that motions must generally be made in writing with 
notice provided as required by our procedural rules unless the 
motion is made during a hearing or trial.  And, we again note 
that Hawai‘ i
 courts should liberally construe the filings of pro 
se litigants.  Finally, because the Intermediate Court of 
Appeals relied upon monetary sanctions imposed by the circuit 
court upon the plaintiff in affirming the dismissal order, we 
review the sanction orders in light of applicable law. 
I. BACKGROUND 
A. Trial Court Proceedings 
  On July 10, 2013,  Theodorico Erum, Jr.,  filed a 
Statement of Claim against Josue Bumatay Llego in the Small 
Claims Court of the Fifth Circuit (small claims court) in the 
amount of $2,650.00 for property damage to his vehicle from a 
July 12, 2012 automobile collision in Kapa ʻa, Hawaiʻi.  In his ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
3 
 Statement of Claim, Erum stated that, on the day of the 
accident, he was stopped at a traffic sign when the rear end of 
his Toyota pickup truck was struck by a Dodge taxi van driven by 
Llego.  The small claims court entered final judgment in Erum’s 
favor on August 6, 2013, and he was awarded $236.69 in damages, 
plus fees and mileage for a total amount of $311.69  (small 
claims court judgment).   
  
On July 11, 2014, Erum, proceeding pro se, filed a 
complaint against Llego in the District Court of the Fifth 
Circuit (district court)  alleging personal injuries and property 
damage arising out of the July 12, 2012 automobile accident.1  
Llego, through an attorney, filed an answer on September 15, 
2014, disputing liability and damages and making  a demand for a 
jury trial, which resulted in the commitment  of the case from 
the district court to the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit 
(circuit court).2   
  
On June 10, 2015, Erum  moved for an extension of time 
to file his pretrial statement,  which Erum indicated had been 
                     
 1 Erum studied law via a correspondence course and became licensed 
to practice law in California in 1968.  He has never received a law degree.  
He practiced law as a sole practitioner in Los Angeles for approximately 
three and a half years until about 1972 -1973, when he returned to Hawai ‘i to 
care for his parents.  Erum did not obtain a license to practice law in 
Hawai‘i after returning and has never practiced law in this state.   
 
 2 All circuit court proceedings were presided over by the Honorable 
Randal G.B. Valenciano.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
4 
 due on June 6, 2015.  The court granted the motion , and the due 
date for Erum’s pretrial statement  was continued to December 6, 
2015.  Erum neglected to file a pretrial statement by that date, 
and on March 7, 2016, Llego filed a motion to dismiss the case 
for failure to prosecute.  Erum filed his pretrial statement on 
March 16, 2016, and an opposition to Llego’s motion to dismiss 
on March 21, 2016.  In a declaration attached to his memorandum 
in opposition, Erum averred that his failure to submit his 
pretrial statement was due to his mistakenly placing the wrong 
date in his personal calendar as the due date, and that the 
error was brought to his attention by Llego’s March 7 motion to 
dismiss.   
  
In an order entered on May 13, 2016, the circuit court 
found that although Erum did not timely submit his pretrial 
statement, dismissal was “too harsh a sanction.”  However, the 
court stated that Erum’s failure to timely file his pretrial 
statement “compelled Defendant to file the Motion .”3  On that 
basis, the court ordered Erum to pay all attorneys’ fees and 
costs related to the motion, including the fees and costs 
related to drafting the order denying Llego’s motion to dismiss 
                     
 3 There is no indication in the record that Llego communicated to 
Erum that a motion to dismiss would be filed if a pretrial statement was not 
filed by a specific date.   
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
5 
 and reducing the order to a judgment.  The court did not cite 
the authority pursuant to which the sanction was awarded, nor 
did the court find that Erum had acted in bad faith by failing 
to file his pretrial statement.  Based on a declaration filed by 
defense counsel, the court awarded Llego $3,007.79 in attorneys’  
fees and $272.40 in costs.4   
  
On May 16, 2016, Erum filed a motion requesting that 
the circuit court schedule a status conference for the purpose 
of setting a trial date.  The court entered an 
order granting 
Erum’s motion and scheduled a trial setting status  conference 
for June 21, 2016.  At the status conference,  Erum and Llego 
agreed to a jury trial with a duration of three  to four days.  
On July 5, 2016, the court filed an order setting a pretrial 
conference on December 22, 2016, and scheduling trial for t he 
week of January 17, 2017. 
  On July 11, 2016, Llego moved to dismiss with 
prejudice Erum’s property damage claim, arguing that the 
judgment of the small claims court barred his property damage 
claim under the doctrine of res judicata.  Llego also sought an 
award of attorneys’ fees and costs, alleging that Erum knew that 
                     
 4 The order that specified the amount of the award also did not 
contain any other findings or conclusions.  This is similarly true of the 
other orders in this case in which the court specified the amount of monetary 
sanctions awarded. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
6 
 his claim was frivolous and barred by res judicata, that defense 
counsel had informed Erum that it would seek sanctions if Erum 
refused to voluntarily dismiss his claim with prejudice, and 
that Erum had not so dismissed his claim.   
  Erum did not file an opposition to Llego’s motion and 
instead, on July 27, 2016, Erum filed a Cross- Motion for 
Continuance of Hearing on Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss with 
Prejudice Plaintiff’s Property Damag e Claim (cross-motion), 
stating that he was seeking vacatur of the small claims court 
judgment via writ of mandamus to this court, and that his claim 
would not be barred if the requested writ was issued.  Erum 
filed a petition for writ of mandamus on August 5, 2016, and 
this court issued an order denying his petition on August 18, 
2016.  Erum v. Kobayashi, No. SCPW -16-0000550, 2016 WL 4398441 
(Aug. 18, 2016).  On December 2, 2016, the circuit court entered 
a written order granting Llego’s motion to dismiss the property 
damage claim and awarded Llego $2,801.54 in fees and $288.00 in 
costs associated with the motion to dismiss.  In the order, the 
court found that Erum’s cross-motion was untimely filed and that  
Llego had afforded Erum an opportunity to withdraw his claim 
with prejudice and Erum had not done so.  The order did not 
include findings that Erum’s  cross-motion or mandamus petition ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
7 
 were frivolous  or made in bad faith, nor did it cite the 
authority pursuant to which the sanctions were granted.   
  On December 8, 2016, Llego filed a motion to enforce 
settlement, or in the alternative, continue the trial (motion to 
enforce settlement).  Llego also requested that the court award 
fees and costs incurred by defense counsel in conducting 
settlement negotiations and in making the motion to enforce 
settlement.  In a declaration attached to his motion, Llego 
contended that the parties had reached a final settlement on 
November 9, 2016, but Erum had intentionally delayed execution 
of the settlement documents in bad faith.  Llego maintained that 
the parties had agreed that Llego would pay Erum $16,000.00  in 
general damages, Llego would not pursue collection of any 
sanctions against Erum, Erum would sign a standard r elease and 
indemnity a greement and s tipulation for d ismissal with 
prejudice, and Erum would be responsible for any and all medical 
bills related to the automobile accident.   
  In the motion to enforce settlement, Llego stated that 
on November 9,  2016, defense counsel wrote a confirmatory letter 
to Erum setting forth the material terms of the settlement as 
outlined above,  and a week later, he mailed settlement agreement 
documents to Erum.  Llego further stated that Erum contacted 
defense counsel on November 29, 2016, to advise Llego that he ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
8 
 would not execute the documents as drafted because the agreement 
document released a party designated as “J’s Taxi” whom Erum did 
not agree to release.  According to Llego, Erum said  that he 
would not release J’s Taxi unless Erum received additional money 
in the settlement.  Llego indicated that he obtained authority 
from the insurance carrier to remove J’s Taxi from the agreement 
and so informed Erum, but Erum advised defense counsel that he 
would be visiting the doctor and might require future treatment, 
in which case Erum would want  an additional amount to settle his 
case against Llego.  D efense counsel stated that  he continued to 
contact Erum to resolve the matter but that as of December 5, 
2016, the parties had not reached agreement in the case. 
  On December 12, 2016, Erum filed an opposition to 
Llego’s motion to enforce settlement  in which he disputed 
Llego’s contention that a final settlement had been reached and 
stated that the terms of the agreement as drafted by Llego’s 
counsel were not,  and had never been,  acceptable  to him.  In his 
opposition, Erum maintained that during settlement negotiations 
he had informed defense counsel that he would not settle unless 
Llego agreed to pay for future medical treatment of his injuries 
arising from the automobile accident and to vacate the order and ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
9 
 final judgment awarding Llego attorneys ’ fees and costs.5  Erum 
further asserted that he had contacted defense counsel on 
November 29, 2016, to inform counsel that the documents as 
drafted were not acceptable because 
he had not agreed to release 
J’s Taxi, the agreement did not provide for the vacatur of the 
sanction award, and the agreement did not provide for the 
payment of Erum’s future medical expenses by Llego.   
  
At a hearing held on December 13, 2016, the circuit 
court denied Llego’s motion to enforce the settlement and 
granted the alternative motion to continue trial.  A written 
order granting Llego’s motion to continue  was entered on January 
27, 2017, in which the court stated that “[Defense counsel]’s 
actions in the settlement negotiations with 
Plaintiff were made 
in good faith.  The Court further finds that Plaintiff’s actions 
in the settlement negotiations were not made in good faith. ”  On 
that basis, the court awarded sanctions against Erum for Llego’s 
attorneys’ fees and costs associated with the unsuccessful 
settlement negotiations.  The court did not conduct an 
evidentiary hearing regarding the settlement negotiations or 
make any findings of fact in the order that set forth the basis 
                     
 5 The confirmatory letter sent to Erum by defense counsel did not 
refer to the release of J ’s Taxi or to vacating the awards of sanctions to 
Llego.  Instead, the letter stated Llego would not pursue collection of the 
sanctions.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
10 
 for its determination that Erum negotiated in bad faith or that 
supported the granting of  monetary sanctions.  The court also 
did not cite the authority pursuant to which the sanction was 
awarded.  Erum filed an opposition to the proposed award of 
attorneys’ fees, maintaining that he had not negotiated in bad 
faith.  On February 15, 2017, the court entered an order 
awarding Llego $4,577.04 in sanctions against Erum for the fees 
and costs in curred by Llego’s counsel related to the 
unsuccessful settlement negotiation.   
  T he court on January 6, 2017,  filed an amended o rder 
setting the trial date for April 3, 2017, and providing dates 
for the submission of pretrial documents.  Erum did not submit 
the pretrial documents by the applicable deadlines and instead, 
on February 27, 2017, filed a motion for continuance of trial.  
In a declaration attached to his motion, Erum stated that Llego 
had extended a settlement offer to him on February 15, 2017, 
that he had responded with a counteroffer on February 25, 2017, 
and that a settlement conference with the court was scheduled 
for March 24, 2017.  In the event a settlement was reached, Erum 
stated, trial would no longer be required.  Additionally, Erum 
stated that if the settlement negotiations failed, he intended 
to retain a personal injury attorney to represent him at trial.  
The requested continuance, Erum stated, would enable such ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
11 
 counsel to prepare for trial and submit the requisite pretrial 
documents in compliance with the various deadlines.   
  On March 3, 2017, Llego filed a motion to dismiss or 
in the alternative to exclude all of Erum’s pretrial documents 
that were not filed by the deadlines set out in the a mended 
order.  In his motion, Llego  argued that the fact that the 
parties were engaged in settlement negotiations did not excuse 
Erum from submitting his pretrial documents by the applicable 
deadlines.  Two weeks later, Llego filed an opposition to Erum’s 
motion to continue, in which he incorporated by reference his 
motion to dismiss or in the alternative to exclude Erum’s 
pretrial documents.  Erum filed an opposition to Llego’s motion 
to dismiss on March 22, 2017, stating that he expected that the 
continuance of trial would also extend the due date for pretrial 
documents and further that dismissal with prejudice  was 
unwarranted because there was no showing of deliberate delay, 
contumacious conduct, or prejudice to Llego.6   
  
At the hearing on Llego’s motion to dismiss, held on  
April 18, 2017, at 1:00 p.m.,  the court denied Llego’s motion  to 
dismiss or in the alternative to exclude Erum’s pretrial 
                     
 6 At a hearing on March 23, 2017, the court took the trial off 
calendar and continued the motion to dismiss in order  for the court to 
determine how the case would proceed in light of Erum’s filing of a 
bankruptcy petition on March 16, 2017.   
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
12 
 documents.   The court continued the trial to September 18, 2017, 
and orally informed the parties that the pretrial conference 
would take place on August 24, 2017 .  In a written order entered 
on May 19, 2017, the court stated that it had reviewed the 
pleadings and heard oral argument and was denying Llego’s motion 
on that basis.  The court nevertheless awarded Llego fees and 
costs related to his motion to dismiss.   
  A settlement conference was scheduled on the same day 
as the hearing on Llego’s motion to dismiss,  April 18, 2017, at 
4:00 p.m.  Although Erum appeared at the hearing held at 1:00 
p.m., when he did not appear at  the settlement conference later 
that afternoon,  Llego orally moved to dismiss the case for 
failure to prosecute.  The court stated that it would not grant 
an oral motion but would allow Llego to file a written motion.   
  On May 11, 2017, Llego filed a motion to dismiss the 
case with prejudice, a sserting  that Erum’s failure to appear at 
the settlement conference was a deliberate, contumacious delay 
that prejudiced him because it  cost him and his  counsel 
significant time and resources.  Erum filed a memorandum in 
opposition to the motion on May 24,  2017.  In a declaration 
attached to his memorandum in opposition, Erum averred that on 
April 18, 2017, at about 3:00 p.m., shortly before the 
settlement conference was to be held, he suffered an onset of ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
13 
  atrial fibrillation.  Erum stated in his declaration that he is 
84 years old and suffers from multiple illnesses, one of which 
is sporadic atrial fibrillation.  Sporadic atrial fibrillation, 
Erum stated, can lead to a stroke, heart attack, or heart 
failure unless treated.  Because his attention was solely 
directed to treating his illness, he inadvertently failed to 
attend the settlement conference on April 18, 2017, Erum 
explained.7   
  
A hearing was held on June 1, 2017, in which the court 
denied Llego’s motion to dismiss bu t again awarded Llego fees  
and costs incurred in making the motion.  In total, Llego 
received five awards of sanctions throughout the course of 
litigation (collectively, monetary sanction orders).  The record 
                     
 7 Erum’s declaration states as follows:  
 
I am 84 years old.  My illnesses include sporadic atrial 
fibrillation (fibrillation of the atrium chamber of the 
heart), which could lead to a stroke, heart attack or heart 
failure unless attended to by the restoration of a normal 
heartbeat by medication or electro -cardio conversion.  
At about 3 p.m. on April 18, 2017, shortly before a 
settlement conference was to [be] held by the Court, as 
earlier announced by the Court during a 1 p.m. hearing on 
the same day, I suffered an onset of atrial fibrillation, 
which is one of my illnesses.  Because this illness 
required immediate attention, I immediately drove home to 
obtain my medication (Amiodarone 200 mg.) for its 
treatment.  Because my immediate attention was solely 
directed to treating this illness to avoid any life 
threatening consequences for not doing so, I inadvertently 
overlooked and failed to comply with the Court’s 
requirement that I attend the subject settlement 
conference.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
14 
 contains judgments for the first three awards, the respective 
amounts of which were $3,280.19, $3,089.54, and $4,577.04 for a 
total of $10,946.77.8   
  In imposing the  sanction s with regard to the May 11, 
2017 motion to dismiss, t he court again did not cite the 
authority under which the sanction was made, nor did it find 
that Erum had acted in bad faith by failing to attend the 
settlement conference.  At the hearing, Llego asked the court to 
order Erum to file his pretrial documents by a date certain to 
avoid prejudicing Llego, but Erum indicated that he did not 
intend to file any pretrial documents for strat egic reasons.   
The court apparently did not consider Erum’s decision not to 
file pretrial documents problematic or a rule violation.9   
                     
 8 The monetary sanction orders include the following: (i) Order Re: 
Defendant Josue Bumatay Llego’s Motion  For Dismissal With Prejudice For 
Failure To Prosecute Case, entered on May 13, 2016; (ii) Order 1) Granting 
Defendant Josue Bumatay Llego’s Motion To Dismiss With Prejudice Plaintiff’s 
Property Damage Claim; And 2) Order Denying Plaintiff Theodorico Erum’ s Cross 
Motion To Continue Hearing on Defendant Josue Bumatay Llego’s Motion To 
Dismiss with Prejudice Plaintiff’s Property Damage Claim, entered on December 
2, 2016; (iii) Order Granting In Part And Denying In Part Defendant Josue 
Bumatay Llego’s Motion t o Enforce Settlement Or In The Alternative For 
Continuation Of Trial, entered on January 27, 2017; (iv) Order Denying Josue 
Bumatay Llego’s Motion To Dismiss Case With Prejudice Or In The Alternative 
To Exclude All Of Plaintiff’s Pre -trial Documents That Were Due Under The 
January 6, 2017 Amended Order Filed On March 3, 2017, entered on May 19, 
2017; (v) and Order Denying Defendant Josue Bumatay Llego’s Motion For 
Dismissal With Prejudice Filed on May 11, 2017, entered on July 18, 2017.  
 
 9 The court respo nded to Erum’s statement that he did not intend to 
file pretrial documents by asking Llego’s counsel to include Erum’s statement 
in the order denying Llego’s motion to dismiss.   
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
15 
   On August 24, 2017, the day of the  calendared pretrial 
conference, Erum did not appear.  Llego made an oral motion to 
dismiss the case,  although there was no in -court proceeding 
scheduled and Erum was not present.  The court nonetheless 
granted Llego’s oral motion to dismiss with prejudice , and trial 
in the case was taken off calendar.  At the time the court 
dismissed the case,  seven months and one week had elapsed from 
the original trial date.   The trial  date had been continued 
twice: once at the request of Llego  because settlement 
negotiations had broken down;  and the second time at the request 
of Erum because the parties had re -entered settlement 
negotiations and a settlement conference was scheduled with the 
court.  On September 13, 2017, Erum, apparently unaware that the 
court had already granted Llego’s oral motion to dismiss, 
submitted an “Emergency Ex Parte Motion to Reschedule Trial”  
(emergency m otion) and moved for the trial to be continued and 
rescheduled 
so as to allow sufficient time for the Court to consider 
the Defendant’s apparent reque st for dismissal of this 
action, which should be made by the Defendant by written 
motion, as well as to allow sufficient time for Plaintiff 
to respond to such motion.   
  On September 15, 2017,  the court issued an Order 
Granting Llego’s Oral Moti on for Dismissal with Prejudice 
(Dismissal Order).  The Dismissal Order indicated that Erum was 
not present at the pretrial conference on August 24, 2017, which ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
16 
 he had been orally instructed to attend by the court at the 
hearing on April 18, 2017.10  The Dismissal Order also noted  that 
the motion to dismiss was brought  pursuant to Hawai‘i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rules 16 and 37, but it did not state the 
rule(s) on which the oral motion to dismiss was granted.  
The 
Dismissal Order instead stated  that the cour t’s decision was 
made after “review[ing] the pleadings, consider[ing] the entire 
case record, and hear[ing] oral argument.”  The same day, the 
court summarily stamped “Denied” on Erum’s emergency motion.   
  
On September 27, 2017, a Judgment Re: Order Granting 
Defendant Josue Bumatay Llego’s Oral Motion for Dismissal with 
Prejudice (circuit court judgment) was filed,  dismissing the 
case with prejudice pursuant to the oral motion to dismiss 
“heard on August 24, 2017 .”  On October 10, 2017, Erum filed a 
Motion to Set A side Judgment of Dismissal and to R eschedule 
Trial Without F urther P retrial Conferences (motion to set 
aside).  In a declaration attached to his motion to set aside, 
Erum averred that he inadvertently did not attend the August 24, 
                     
 10 The Dismissal Order states that “On April 18, 2017, the Court 
orally ordered the parties to appear for the August 24, 2017 pre -trial 
conference.”  Other than the court’s oral instruction to Erum at the hearing 
on April 18, 2017, which was the same day he suffered a debilitating medical 
episode that prevented him from attending an afternoon settlement conference, 
there is no indication in the record that Erum was given any other 
instruction regarding the August 24, 2017 pretrial conference.   
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
17 
  2017 pretrial conference due to memory lapses and mental 
confusion associated with his age of 85 and the side effects of 
medications taken for his illnesses.11  Erum contended that there 
was “no evidence in the record or offered by Llego in his oral 
motion which shows that Erum ’s failure to attend that pretrial 
conference was contumacious conduct (willful resistance to 
authority) or was deliberately made by Erum to delay the 
prosecution of this case. ”  Erum further stated that “it was 
erroneous for the trial court to enter such judgment of 
dismissal with prejudice without notice to Erum and without a 
written motion and a hearing.”  On October 27, 2017, Llego filed 
an opposition to Erum’s motion.  Also on October 27, 2017, Erum 
filed a Notice of Appeal,  appealing from the circuit court 
judgment and the Dismissal Order.  On December 5, 2017, the 
court denied Erum’s motion to set aside, concluding that it 
                     
 11 The declaration states in full as follows:  
 
I, the undersigned, am the plaintiff in  this case.  I am 85 
years old and suffer from memory lapses and mental 
confusion associated with my elderly age and which are also 
the side effects of medications which I take for my 
illnesses, which include, sporadic atrial fibrillation 
(i.e. irregular heartbeat of the atrial chamber of the 
heart), hypertension (i.e. high blood pressure), abdominal 
hernia (i.e. protrusion of the abdominal wall), and gout 
(i.e., inflammation of the joint.  As a result of these 
medical conditions, I mistakenly failed to calendar and 
thus mistakenly failed to remember and attend the pretrial 
conference held by the Court in this case on August 24, 
2017. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
18 
 lacked jurisdiction over the matter since Erum had filed a 
Notice of Appeal.12   
B. ICA Proceedings 
  
In a Summary Disposition Order (SDO), the Intermediate 
Court of Appeals (ICA ) concluded that the circuit court did not 
abuse its discretion in granting Llego’s oral motion to 
dismiss.13  The ICA stated  that, throughout the case, Erum 
“missed deadlines, refused to volunt arily dismiss the property 
damage claim . . . was found not to have conducted settlement 
negotiations in good faith, failed and refused to submit 
pretrial documents . . . and failed to attend court- ordered 
                     
 12 After filing his Notice of Appeal, Erum filed a declaration in 
support of his request to proceed in forma pauperis.  Erum  stated that he was 
unable to pay the costs for proceedings or give security because of his 
poverty.  Specifically, Erum related that he received $453.00 monthly in 
social security payments and had less than $10.00 in his checking and savings 
accounts.  Erum also stated that he was receiving monthly rental payments 
from properties, but that those properties were in foreclosure.  Erum’s 
request to proceed in forma pauperis was approved.   
  The dissent concludes Erum made his declaration in bad faith and 
that it demonstrates his willingness to “make false statements to the court 
for financial gain.”  Dissent at 2 3 n.14.  This breathtaking accusation is 
inferred from a statement in Erum’s declaration that his last employer was 
the United States Air Force.  During his deposition, Erum had stated that he 
served six years in the Air Force after attending college, spent another year 
and a half in school, and then between 1958 and 1960 spent about a year and a 
half working for a bank and the federal government.  He was subsequently 
self-employed for the rest of his career.  Erum’s statement that the Air 
Force was his last employer rather than the federal government, which related 
to employment 55 years earlier, does not warrant the accusation leveled by 
the dissent.  Moreover, the dissent does not explain how this “false 
statement” could have benefitted Erum’s application to proceed in forma 
pauperis.  The dissent’s attack on Erum’s character is unjustified.   
 
 13 The ICA’s SDO can be found at Erum v. Llego, No. CAAP -17-0000762, 
2019 WL 1923002 (App. Apr. 30, 2019) (SDO).

 conferences.”  (Footnote omitted.)  The ICA further noted that 
the circuit court had awarded monetary sanctions against Erum 
five times prior to dismissing the case and that Erum had 
offered no reason for his failure to attend the final pretrial 
conference on August 24, 2017.  The ICA, citing Webb v. Harvey , 
103 Hawai‘ i 63, 79 P.3d 681 (App. 2003), concluded that the 
circuit court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Erum’s 
case based on the record.    
II. STANDARD S OF REVIEW  
 
 Sanctions imposed under statute, court rule, or the 
trial court’s inheren t powers are reviewed for an abuse of 
discretion.  Gap v. Puna Geothermal Venture, 106 Hawai ‘i 325, 
331, 104 P.3d 912, 918 (2004).  The trial court abuses its 
discretion if it bases its ruling on an erroneous view of the 
law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.  Id.  
  When interpreting rules promulgated by the court, 
principles of statutory construction apply.  Bank of Am., N.A. 
v. Reyes-Toledo , 143 Hawai ‘i 249, 
257, 428 P.3d 761, 769 (2018) 
(quoting Ranger Ins. Co. v. Hinshaw, 103 Hawai ‘i  26, 30, 79 P.3d 
119, 123 (2003)).  Interpretation of a statute is a question of 
law which we review de novo.

 III. DISCUSSION  
A. HRCP Rule 7(b)(1) Requires that All Motions Be Made in Writing 
Properly Served on the Opposing Party Unless the Motion Is 
Made During a Hearing or Trial. 
  
HRCP Rule 7(b) (2000 )14 governs the manner in which 
motions must be made before the trial court.  HRCP Rule 7(b)(1) 
requires that all motions be made in writing unless the motion 
is made during a hearing or trial.  See also  Cooke Tr. Co. v. 
Chinn Ho, 43 Haw. 243, 245 (Haw. Terr. 1959) (per curiam) 
(granting a motion to dismiss an appeal for non- compliance with 
HRCP Rule 7(b)(1) because the oral motion seeking allowance of 
an interlocutory appeal was not made during a hearing or trial).   
  Llego made an  oral motion to dismiss the c omplaint 
during a pretrial conference where he was the only party 
present.  HRCP Rule 16(c) ( 2000) sets out the subjects for 
consideration at a pretrial conference.  Of the sixteen 
enumerated subjects, the only one concerning motions is HRCP 
Rule 16(c)(11), which states that “consideration may be 
                     
 14 HRCP Rule 7(b) states in relevant part as follows:  
 
(1) An application to the court for an order shall be by 
motion which, unless made during a hearing or trial, shall 
be made in writing, shall state with particularity the 
grounds therefor, and shall set forth the relief or order 
sought.  The requirement of writing is fulfilled if the 
motion is stated in a written notice of the hearing of the 
motion. 
 
(Emphasis added.) ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
21 
 given . . . [to] the disposition of pending  motions[.]”  
(Emphasis added.)  No motions were pending in this case when the 
pretrial conference began.  As such, the pretrial conference was 
not a “hearing” for the purposes of satisfying HRCP Rule 
7(b)(1)’s requirement that m otions be made in writing unless 
made during a hearing or trial. 
  The writing requirement of HRCP Rule 7(b)(1)15 was 
addressed in Benezet v. Nowell, 42 Haw. 581 (Haw. Terr. 1958).  
In that case, the plaintiff made an oral motion, in open court, 
to reopen a case for the introduction of additional evidence.  
Id. at 582.  After hearing arguments from both parties, the 
trial court granted the motion.  Id.  On appeal, the Benezet 
court affirmed the trial court’s granting of the motion, stating 
that although the motion was not made in writing, it was made in 
open court at a hearing at which opposing counsel was present.  
Id. at 584.  Since the defendant received notice of the hearing, 
appeared at the hearing, and made oral argument on the motion, 
                     
 15 The court in Benezet quotes HRCP Rule 7(b)(1) as follows:  
 
This rule provides “An application to the court for an 
order shall be by motion which, unless made during a 
hearing or trial, shall be made in writing, shall state 
with particularity the grounds therefor, and shall set 
forth the relief or order sought.  The requirement of 
writing is fulfilled if the motion is stated in a written 
notice of the hearing of the motion.”  
 
42 Haw. at 584.  This language is identical to HRCP Rule 7(b)(1) (2000).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
22 
 the court stated, the purposes of the writing requirement were 
satisfied.  Id.   
  Unlike the defendant in Benezet, Erum was not present 
at the August 24, 2017 pretrial conference when Llego moved to 
dismiss Erum’s case.  And because he was not present at the 
pretrial conference and no written motion was filed, Erum did 
not receive a pleading that “state[d] with particularity the 
grounds therefor, and . . . set forth the relief or order 
sought” as required by HRCP Rule 7(b)(1).  
  Erum was also not given notice of the motion as 
specified by HRCP Rule 5(a) (2000 ),16 which requires service of 
motions.  Instead, the court heard argument from Llego’s counsel 
on the ex parte motion at the pretrial conference and summarily 
granted the motion with prejudice , contrary to the requirement 
that notice of the motion and its grounds be given to Erum 
                     
 16 HRCP Rule 5(a) states in relevant part as follows:  
 
Every order required by its terms to be served, every 
pleading subsequent to the original complaint unless the 
court otherwise orders because of numerous defendants, 
every paper relating to discovery required to be served 
upon a party unless the court otherwise orders, every 
written motion other than one which may be heard ex parte, 
and every written notice, appearance, demand, brief or 
memorandum of law, offer of judgment, bill of costs, 
designation of record on appeal, and similar  paper shall be 
served upon each of the parties[.]  
 
(Emphases added.) ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
23 
 before consideration of the motion.  Erum argued to the circuit 
court that Llego’s motion to dismiss should have been made in 
writing and in a manner that allowed Erum an opportunity to 
respond, which is precisely what is required by HRCP Rule 
7(b)(1). 
  We note , however, that Erum’s application for 
certiorari, which is only one page in length, does not include 
as a question presented the court’s failure to comply with HRCP 
Rule 7(b)(1) and, in fact,  does not contain a section setting 
forth questions presented; thus the application contravenes  
Hawaii
 Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 40.1(d) (2017) .17  
A strict application of HRAP Rule 40.1(d) would require that 
Erum’s application for writ of certiorari be disregarded unless  
plain error was to be invoked.  But such an application of the 
rule would contravene a fundamental tenet of our law: “pleadings 
                     
 17 HRAP Rule 40(d)(1) provides as follows:  
(d) Contents. The application for a writ of certiorari 
shall not exceed 12 pages and shall contain in the 
following order:  
 
(1) A short and concise statement of the questions 
presented for decision, set forth in the most general 
terms possible.  The statement of a question presented 
will be deemed to include every subsidiary question 
fairly comprised therein.  Questions not presented 
according to this paragraph will be disregarded.  The 
supreme court, at its option, may notice a plain error 
not presented.

24 . . . . prepared by pro se litigants should be interpreted liberally.”  
Waltrip v. TS Enters., Inc., 140 Hawai ‘i 226, 239, 398 P.3d 815, 
828 (2016) (brackets omitted) (quoting Dupree v. Hiraga, 121 
Hawai‘i 297, 314, 219 P.3d 1084, 1101 (2009)).  Underlying this 
principle of law is “the promotion of equal access to justice--a 
pro se litigant should not be prevented from proceeding on a 
pleading or letter to an agency if a reasonable, liberal 
construction of the document would permit him or her to do so.”  
Id. (citing, inter alia, Eldridge v. Block , 832 F.2d 1132, 1137  
(9th Cir. 1987) (“The Supreme Court has instructed the federal 
courts to liberally construe the ‘inartful pleading’ of pro se 
litigants”) (citing Boag v. MacDougall, 454 U.S. 364, (1982) 
(per curiam))). 
Liberal interpretation of a pro se litigant’s 
application for writ of certiorari is consistent with this 
court’s and the ICA’s holdings that a pro se litigant’s failure 
to state the alleged errors of the lower court in precise 
compliance with HRAP Rule 28(b) (2016)  will not foreclose18
18HRAP Rule 28(b) provides in relevant part as follows: 
Within 40 days after the filing of the record on appeal,

can reasonably be discerned.  Housing Fin. & Dev. Corp. v.

(addressing an appeal on the merits despite the fact that the 
opening brief fell “woefully short” of the requirements of HRAP 
Rule 28(b) and did not state the points of error alleged or 
where in the record the errors occurred and contained a one-
sentence statement of the case); In re Estate of Damon, 119 
Hawai‘i 500, 503 -04, 199 P.3d 89, 92- 93 (2008) (addressing the 
merits of one of appellants arguments despite the fact that the 
citation for the relevant point of error was located in the 
statement of the case); Wagner v. World Botanical Gardens, Inc., 
126 Hawai‘ i 190, 193, 268 P.3d 443, 446 (App. 2011) (addressing

 they can reasonably be discerned” although finding that the 
opening brief did not meet the requirements of HRAP Rule 28(b) 
in a variety of ways); see also  Tautua v. BCI Coca- Cola Bottling 
Co., No. 30291, 2012 WL 2308162 (App. June 18, 2012) (SDO) 
(addressing points of error “to the extent that they can  be 
discerned” because appellant had not included points of error in 
the opening brief).  This approach is particularly appropriate 
when, despite failing to articulate points of error on appeal, 
“the remaining sections of the brief provide the necessary 
information to identify the party ’s argument” and “petitioner 
had raised the same argument before the trial court.”  Marvin v. 
Pflueger, 127 Hawai ‘i 490, 496, 280 P.3d 88, 94 (2012).   
  This court additionally has long adhered to the policy 
of affording litigants the opportunity to be heard on the merits 
whenever possible.  Morgan v. Planning Dep ’t, 104 Hawai ‘i 173, 
180-81, 86 P.3d 982, 989-90 (2004) (quoting O ’Connor v. Diocese 
of Honolulu, 77 Hawai‘i 383, 386, 885 P.2d 361, 364 (1994)).  In 
view of this longstanding policy, we believe that pro se 
litigants should not automatically have their access to 
appellate review in this court foreclosed because of failure to 
conform to requirements of the procedural rules.  See id.  
Indeed, we have instructed the lower courts to liberally 
interpret the filings of pro se litigants if possible, and this ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
27 
 court is equally obligated to interpret applications for 
certiorari liberally in order to facilitate access to justice.  
Waltrip, 140 Hawai ‘i at 240, 398 P.3d at 829 . 
  In the statement of the case of his application, Erum 
contends that when he mistakenly failed to attend a pretrial 
conference, “the circuit court granted an oral motion by Llego 
to dismiss the case 
with prejudice without a hearing which the 
circuit court granted. ”  The argument paragraph is only four 
sentences and states that the dismissal was inconsistent with 
our holding in In re Blaisdell, 125 Hawai ‘i 44, 252
 P.3d 63 
(2011), and this court’s policy of having cases heard on the 
merits when possible.  In addition to the statements in the 
application, Erum argued in his 
emergency m otion that continuing 
the trial would allow the circuit court sufficient time to 
consider Llego’s apparent request to dismiss the action, “which 
should be made by the Defendant by written motion, as well as to 
allow sufficient time for Plaintiff to respond to such motion.”  
In his motion to set aside, Erum contended th at there was “no 
evidence in the record or offered by Llego in his oral motion 
which shows that Erum’s failure to attend that pretrial 
conference was contumacious conduct (willful resistance to 
authority) or was deliberately made by Erum to delay the 
prosecution of this case.”  Erum further stated that “it was ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
28  
(continued. . .)  
 erroneous for the trial court to enter such judgment of 
dismissal with prejudice without notice to Erum and without a 
written motion and a hearing.”  In his opening brief before the 
ICA, Erum simply i dentifies the court’s granting of Llego’s oral 
motion to dismiss with prejudice as the point of error on 
appeal.   
  Thus, liberally construing Erum’s application for 
certiorari, we discern from it, as informed by the arguments 
Erum made before the trial court, that the following questions 
are presented (1) whether the granting of an oral motion to 
dismiss with prejudice, without a hearing, was a proper exercise 
of the court’s discretion; and (2) whether the circuit court 
abused its discretion in dismissing the case with prejudice 
under our holding in Blaisdell . 
  B ecause of our disposition of the other issue Erum  
raises, it is unnecessary to further address the violation of 
HRCP Rule 7(b) in this case.19  Nevertheless, because of the 
                     
 19 The dissent argues that our consideration of the court’s 
noncompliance with HRCP  Rule 7(b) is an improper exercise of plain error 
review because the rule was not specifically referred to in the application.  
Dissent at 24 (citing HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) (2016)).  The contention is 
inapposite because we do not consider this issue under the plain error 
doctrine.  The dissent further contends that our consideration of the issue 
disregards the “principle of party presentation.”  Dissent at 32.  As 
explained, under fundamental principles of this jurisdiction, pro se 
pleadings are to be read liberally, and we conclude that under our precedent 
this issue was adequately raised.  The inapt application of the “principle of 
party presentation” to this case is demonstrated by the case relied upon by ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
29 
 importance of the requirements of HRCP Rule 7(b), we reaffirm 
that a motion must be made in writing and in compliance with 
other provisions of HRCP Rule 7(b) and relevant court rules, 
unless the motion is made at a hearing or trial.20 
B. The Circuit Court Abused I ts Discretion in Entering the 
Dismissal Order Without Making Any Findings of Deliberate Delay 
or Contumacious Conduct and Actual Prejudice and by Failing to 
Explain Why Lesser Sanctions Were Inadequate. 
  It is well established that the involuntary dismissal 
of a complaint with prejudice is such a severe sanction that it 
“should be ordered only in extreme circumstances .”  Blaisdell, 
125 Hawai ‘i at 49, 252 P.3d at 68 (emphasis added); see also 
Shasteen, Inc. v. Hilton Hawaiian Vill.  Joint Venture , 79 Hawai‘i 
                                                                  
(. . .continued)  
 
the dissent.  Dissent at 29 (quoting United States v. Sineneng- Smith, 140 
S.Ct. 1575, 1579 (2020) (holding that the Ninth Circuit violated the party 
presentation principle by sua sponte naming and inviting three amici to brief 
and argue issues framed by the appeals panel after oral argument had been 
concluded).  Further, the party presentation doctrine is generally not 
controlling in circumstances of a pro se litigant.  Castro v. Melchor, 142 
Hawai‘i 1, 19, 414 P.3d 53, 71 (2018) (Nakayama, J., concurring) (stating that 
under the “principle of party presentation” courts hesitate to consider 
issues not raised by the parties “ because our system assumes and depends upon 
the assistance of counsel. ” (emphasis added) (quoting United States v. Pryce, 
938 F.2d 1343, 1353 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (Silberman, J., dissenting))).   
 
 20 We also observe that the circuit court’s consideration and 
granting of Llego’s oral motion to dismiss without notice to Erum  raises 
serious constitutional due process considerations.  The fundamental 
requirements of procedural due process are notice and an opportunity to be 
heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.  Minton v. Quintal, 
131 Hawai‘ i 167, 189, 317 P.3d  1, 23 (2013); see also In re Application of 
Maui Elec. Co., 141 Hawai ‘i 249, 269, 408 P.3d 1, 21 (2017).  Constitutionally 
adequate notice must inform affected parties of the action about to be taken 
against them as well as of procedures available for challenging that action.  
Brown v. Thompson, 91 Hawai ‘i 1, 10, 979 P.2d 586, 595 (1999).   
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
30 
 103, 107, 899 P.2d 386, 390 (1995) (“[D]ismissal of a complaint 
is such a severe sanction, that it should be used only in 
extreme circumstances where there is clear record of delay or 
contumacious conduct . . . .” (quoting Lim v. Harvis Constr.,  
Inc., 65 Haw. 71, 73, 647 P.2d 290, 292 (1982))).  As this court 
stated in Blaisdell, there are only two circumstances in which a 
trial court may, in its sound discretion, dismiss a claim with 
prejudice.  125 Hawai ‘i at 49-50, 252 P.3d at 68- 69.  Dismissal 
with prejudice is not an abuse of discretion when a plaintiff’s 
deliberate delay or contumacious conduct causes actual 
prejudice.21  Chen v. Mah, 146  157, 179– 80, 457 P.3d 796, Hawai‘i
818–19 (2020).  Additionally, because the sanction of dismissal 
with prejudice is one of last resort, it may  be invoked only 
                     
 21 The dissent argues that we are “expand[ing] upon Blaisdell ’s 
standard for involuntary dismissals pursuant to HRCP Rule 41(b), and 
creat[ing] an even higher standard .”  Dissent at 39.  Specifically, the 
dissent contends that under Blaisdell the court could dismiss a case if the 
record merely showed that the defendant suffered actual prejudice, without 
any need to consider deliberate delay or contumacious conduct.  Dissent at 
40.  First, the dissent appears to overlook Chen, wherein this court recently 
considered Blaisdell as well as other relevant precedent that reached the 
conclusions we reiterate today.  146 Hawai ‘i at 179– 80, 457 P.3d at 818 –19.  
Moreover, the dissent would allow dismissal with prejudice solely based on a 
showing that the defendant suffered actual prejudice, without any causal 
connection to the plaintiff’s conduct.  Dissent at 40-41.  But “[p]roof of 
[prejudice] in the air, so to speak, will not do.”   Martin v. Herzog, 126 
N.E. 814, 816 (N.Y. 1920).  There must be a causal connection between the 
plaintiff’s conduct and the defendant’s actual prejudice in order for 
dismissal with prejudice to be warranted.  Blaisdell, 125 Hawai‘ i at 49-50, 
252 P.3d at 68- 69 (“A dismissal with prejudice would not constitute an abuse 
of discretion where a plaintiff’s deliberate delay causes actual prejudice  to 
a defendant.”).   
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
31  
(continued. . .)  
 when the actual prejudice cannot be addressed through lesser 
sanctions.  Id.  Therefore, we have stated that before 
dismissing a case with prejudice the trial court is to consider 
less severe sanctions and state why a lesser sanction “is 
insufficient to serve the interests of justice.”  Id. at 180 
n.29, 457 P.3d at 819 n.29 (citing Blaisdell, 125 Hawai ‘i at 50-
51, 252 P.3d at 69-70) .   
  Llego contends that the foregoing precedents do not 
apply to this case because the circuit court dismissed Erum’s 
claim as a sanction under HRCP Rules 16(f) (2000) and 
37(b)(2)(C) (2015),22 and Blaisdell  involved a dismissal pursuant 
to HRCP Rule 41(b) (2012).23  First, we note that the circuit 
                     
 22 HRCP Rule 16(f) (2000) states as follows:  
 
If a party or party’s attorney fails to obey a scheduling 
or pretrial order, or if no appearance is made on behalf of 
a party at a scheduling or pretrial conference, or if a 
party or party’s attorney is substantially unprepared to 
participate in the conference, or if a party or party’s 
attorney fails to participate in good faith, the judge, 
upon motion or the judge’s own initiative, may make such 
orders with regard thereto as are just, and among others 
any of the orders provided in Rule 37(b)(2)(B), (C), (D).  
In lieu of or in addition to any other sanction, the judge 
shall require the party or the attorney representing the 
party or both to pay the reasonable expenses incurred 
because of any noncompliance with this rule, including 
attorney’s fees, unless the judge finds that the 
noncompliance was substantially justified or that other 
circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.  
 
HRCP Rule 37(b)(2)(C) (2015), in turn, permits an order dismissing the action 
or proceeding or any part thereof.   
 
 23 HRCP Rule 41(b) states in relevant part as follows:  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
32 
 court did not cite any rule as authority in its Dismissal Order.  
But even if it had referenced HRCP Rule 16(f), the preconditions 
for a valid dismissal set forth in Blaisdell result from the 
severity of the sanction of dismissal itself, not from the 
dismissal in that case being  based on HRCP Rule 41(b).  See  
Blaisdell, 125 Hawai ‘i at 49, 252 P.3d at 68 (“[T]he  sanction of 
dismissal of a complaint with prejudice is one of last resort 
where lesser sanctions would not serve the interest of justice.

(citation and brackets omitted)).  The Blaisdell  court did not 
limit the standard it articulated to dismissals pursuant to HRCP 
Rule 41(b); in fact this court has previously applied the 
Blaisdell standard to cases dismissed with prejudice pursuant to 
Rule 12 of the Rules of the Circuit Courts of the State of 
Hawai‘i (RCCH).  See Bagalay v. Lahaina Restoration Found., 60

 failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with these 
rules or any order of the court , a defendant may move for 
dismissal of an action or of any claim against it.” (emphasis 
added)).  The general authorization to dismiss a case under HRCP 
Rules 16(f) and 37(b)(2)(C) for a violation of provisions 
relating to pretrial conferences does not allow a  court to 
bypass the requirements integrated into HRCP Rule 41(b) by 
Blaisdell and other precedent of this court, which are expressly 
applicable to a failure “to comply with these [HRCP] rules or 
any order of the court. ” 
  Further, limiting the application of the Blaisdell 
factors only to those dismissal orders entered under HRCP Rule 
41(b) would produce an inconsistent application of our court 
rules.  See  Ryan v. Palmer, 130 Hawai ‘i 321, 323, 310 P.3d 1022, 
1024 (App. 2013)  (finding that it was abuse of discretion to 
dismiss under RCCH Rule 12(q) absent deliberate delay, 
contumacious conduct, or actual prejudice because allowing such 
dismissal would put RCCH Rule 12(q) and HRCP Rule 41(b) into 
conflict “by expanding the circuit court’ s authority beyond that 
which it possesses under HRCP Rule 41(b) ”); see also  Bagalay, 60 
Haw. at 132, 588 P.2d at 421.   Significantly, there are numerous 
other rules or statutes under which a circuit court may impose 
the sanction of dismissal with prejudice.  See, e.g. , Hawai‘i ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
35 
  Revised Statutes (HRS) § 635-3 (2016);26 HRCP Rule 16(f), Rule 
37(b)(2)(C), R ule 41(b); RCCH Rule 12(q) (2007),27 Rule 
12.1(a)(6) (2000),28 Rule 28 (2007) ,29 Rule 29 (2007).30  The 
                     
 26 HRS § 635-3 provides in relevant part as follows: “The court may 
dismiss any action for want of prosecution after due notice to the claimants 
whenever claimants have failed to bring such action to trial within a period 
established by rule of court.”  
 
 27 RCCH Rule 12(q) states as follows:  
 
An action may be dismissed sua sponte with written notice 
to the parties if a pretrial statement has not been filed 
within 8 months after a complaint has been filed (or within 
any further period of extension granted by the court) or if 
a trial setting status conference has not been scheduled as 
required by Rule 12(c).  Such dismissal may be set aside 
and the action reinstated by order of the court for good 
cause shown upon motion duly filed not later than ten (10) 
days from the date of the order of dismissal.  
 
 28 RCCH Rule 12.1(a)(6) provides in relevant part as follows:  
 
The failure of a party or his attorney to appear at a 
scheduled settlement conference, the neglect of a party or 
his attorney to discuss or attempt to negotiate a 
settlement prior to the conference, or the failure of a 
party to have a person authorized to settle the case 
present at the conference shall, unless a good cause for 
such failure or neglect is shown, be deemed an undue 
interference with orderly procedures.  As sanctions, the 
court may, in its discretion:  
 
(i) Dismiss the action on its own motion, or on the motion 
of any party or hold a party in default, as the case may 
be[.] 
 
 29 RCCH Rule 28 provides as follows:  
 
A diligent effort to effect service shall be made in all 
actions.  An action or claim may be dismissed sua sponte 
with written notice to the parties if no service is made 
within 6 months after the action or claim has been filed.  
Such dismissal may be set aside and the action or claim 
reinstated by order of the court for good cause shown upon 
motion duly filed not later than ten (10) days from the 
date of the order of dismissal.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
36 (continued. . .)  
 District Court Rules of Civil Procedure and the Hawai ‘i Family 
Court Rules contain similar provisions.  Applying  different 
legal standards to similar conduct --based on different rules--
when the rules impose the same sanction of dismissal with 
prejudice undermines the equitable application of the law, 
complicates appellate review, and produces outcomes that turn 
not on the merits but on the litigants’ skill in procedural 
navigation.31  Thus, our decisions interpreting HRCP Rule 41 and

 30 RCCH Rule 29 provides as follows:  
 
An action may be dismissed with prejudice sua sponte with 
written notice to the parties for want of prosecution where 
all defendants are in default and if the plaintiff fails to 
obtain entry of default and fails to apply for default 
judgment within six months after all defendants  are in 
default.  Such dismissal may be set aside and the action 
reinstated by order of the court for good cause shown upon 
motion duly filed not later than ten (10) days from the 
date of the order of dismissal.  
 
 31 In its SDO, the ICA did not address Erum ’s contention that the 
circuit court was required to apply the Blaisdell  factors and instead cited 
Webb v. Harvey, 103 Hawai ‘i 63, 79 P.3d 681 (App. 2003), to support its 
holding that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing 
Erum’s case with prejudice.  Insofar as Webb  stands for the proposition that 
a dismissal with prejudice may be affirmed absent deliberate delay or 
contumacious conduct causing actual prejudice, it was implicitly overruled by 
Blaisdell. 
  The dissent maintains that HRCP Rule 16(f) is excepted from the 
preconditions for a valid dismissal set forth in Blaisdell, but HRCP Rule 16 
does not state that it is excepted from HRCP Rule 41(b)(1).  Dissent at 38-
39.  Rather, HRCP Rule 41(b) specifically provides that its provisions apply 
to all the rules of civil procedure and court orders.  HRCP Rule 41(b)(1) 
(“For failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with these rules  or 
any order of the court , a defendant may move for dismissal.” (emphases 
added)).  As stated, the general ability to dismiss under HRCP Rules 16(f) 
and 37(b)(2)(C), which relates solely to pretrial conferences, does not allow 
the court to bypass the requirements integrated into HRCP Rule 41(b) by 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 discussing involuntary dismissal pursuant to that rule are 
applicable to the involuntary dismissal in this case.32   
1. Deliberate Delay 
  Dismissal with prejudice does not constitute an abuse 
of discretion when a plaintiff’s deliberate delay causes actual 
prejudice to a defendant that cannot be addressed through a 
                                                                  
(. . .continued)  
 
Blaisdell and other precedent of this court.  HRCP Rule 41(b) applies to any 
dismissal for failure to comply with court rules or orders of the court.  The 
dissent provides no adequate justification for distinguishing dismissals 
based on the specific underlying rule violation, particularly when that rule 
violation is expressly subject to the general rule governing involuntary 
dismissals. 
 
 32 The dissent asserts that we are improperly “import[ing] the 
standard for an involuntary dismissal pursuant to HRCP Rule 41(b), as set 
forth in Blaisdell.”  Dissent at 38.  As stated, our caselaw has clearly 
established for over forty years that the standard we apply today is not 
limited to involuntary dismissals entered under HRCP Rule 41(b).  Bagalay, 60 
Haw. at 132, 588 P.2d at 421; Phillips, 72 Haw. at 147, 808 P.2d at 371.  
Indeed, the dismissal in Blaisdell was not specifically entered under HRCP 
Rule 41(b), the circuit court in that case failed to cite the authority for 
its dismissal of Blaisdell’s claims with prejudice.  125 Hawai ‘i at 47, 252 
P.3d at 66.  On appeal,  this court concluded that Blaisdell had violated HRCP 
Rule 4, which governs service of process, and therefore the court had 
authority to dismiss the case pursuant to HRCP Rule 41(b)(2).  Id.  at 48-49, 
252 P.3d at 67- 68.  We further note that the ICA has commonly applied the 
Blaisdell standard in a wide variety of circumstances involving violations of 
court rules or court orders.  See  Middleton v. Dep’t of Human Servs. , No. 
CAAP-13-0002468, 2017 WL 663538 (App. Feb. 17, 2017) (mem.) (applying the

not identify authority pursuant to which dismissal was entered); Rapoza v.

 lesser sanction.  Chen , 146 Hawai ‘i at 179
–80, 457 P.3d at 818 –
19.  The ICA considered the issue of a plaintiff’s deliberate 
delay in Ryan v. Palmer.  130 Hawai‘ i 321, 310 P.3d 1022 (App. 
2013).  In Ryan, the circuit court, pursuant to RCCH 12(q), sua 
sponte dismissed the plaintiff’s tort claim with prejudice on 
the basis that the plaintiff had not filed a pretrial statement 
within 8 months after the complaint was filed.  Id.  at 322, 310 
P.3d at 1023.  The plaintiff moved to set aside the order of 
dismissal, arguing that the failure to submit a pretrial 
statement within the allotted time was an inadvertent error.  
Id.  The circuit court denied the plaintiff’s motion, and the 
plaintiff appealed to the ICA.  Id.   On appeal, the ICA vacated 
the order of dismissal and the order denying the plaintiff’s 
motion to set aside, holding that the circuit court had abused 
its discretion in dismissing the case with prejudice because the 
record did not show a deliberate attempt by the plaintiff to 
delay prosecution of the case or actions that constituted 
contumacious conduct, and the circuit court did not make 
findings to that effect.  Id.  at 324, 310 P.3d at 1025.  
Although the plaintiff had violated RCCH Rule 12(q) by failing 
to file a pretrial statement, the ICA noted that the plaintiff 
had prosecuted the case by actively engaging in discovery and 
had provided a declaration explaining that the failure to submit ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
39 
 the pretrial statement was the result of an inadvertent 
miscommunication between plaintiff’s counsel and co -counsel.  
Id. 
  Like the plaintiff in Ryan, Erum did not timely file a 
pretrial statement, and he was not present at a pretrial 
conference and a settlement conference that he was supposed to 
attend.  Also like the plaintiff in Ryan, Erum filed 
declarations explaining that his conduct w as not deliberate but 
inadvertent.  Erum explained that his failure to timely submit 
his pretrial statement was the result of his mistakenly placing 
the wrong date in his personal calendar.  In regard to his 
absence at the settlement conference held on April 18, 2017, 
Erum stated that he suffered an onset of atrial fibrillation 
that required him to drive home for treatment.  It was on that 
same day that the court orally informed the parties that the 
pretrial conference would be held on August 24, 2017.  Erum was 
not present on that date and the court granted Llego’s oral 
motion to dismiss on that basis.  In the declaration attached to 
his motion to set aside, Erum averred that his failure to attend 
the pretrial conference was not intentional, but instead it was 
due to his advanced age and memory loss caused by his 
medication.  The veracity of Erum’s declarations has not been 
challenged at any stage of these proceedings, and the only other ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
40 (continued. . .)  
 procedural violation of ostensible significance on Erum’s part 
was his strategic decision not to submit pretrial documents, 
which the court apparently did not consider to be a violation.33  
In sum, the record does not show that Erum deliberately delayed 
the prosecution of his case, and the circuit court did not make 
any such finding.34   
                     
 33 The dissent concludes that Erum was deploying creative tactics in 
order to delay proceedings, but it misapprehends the record in making this 
assertion.  First, the dissent concludes that Erum’s refusal to sign the 
settlement agreement doc uments because it released J’s Taxi was a bad faith 
effort to delay the proceedings as the confirmatory letter actually did 
inform Erum the agreement would release J’s Taxi by stating Erum would “sign 
a standard Release and Indemnity Agreement and Stipulation For Dismissal With 
Prejudice Of All Claims And All Parties.”  Dissent at 9 n. 5.  Respectfully, 
J’s Taxi is not, and has never been, a party to this litigation, and the 
dissent does not address Erum’s contention that the drafted agreement was 
also deficient because it did not provide for the vacatur of the sanctions 
awards.  Additionally, the dissent accuses Erum of filing his March 16, 2017 
bankruptcy petition, which sought the reinstatement of a bankruptcy 
proceeding from 2013, in bad faith with the deliberate and sole purpose of 
delaying these proceedings, but there is no indication in the record of such 
an intent.  Dissent at 1 6 n.8.  Finally, despite the absence of any finding 
that Erum deliberately delayed providing an explanation for his absence at  
the April 18, 2017 settlement conference and the record indicating Erum 
immediately explained his nonattendance because of the sudden onset of the 
life-threatening atrial fibrillation condition as soon as it was brought to 
his attention by the motion to dismiss, the dissent accuses Erum of 
misconduct for not sooner explaining his absence.  Dissent at 43.   
 
 34 The dissent contends that our decision “gives license” to 
untimely filings, not appearing as required, or other delay “tactics.”  
Dissent at 44.  This is plainly incorrect.  Regarding the issue of deliberate 
delay, we hold only that the record before us does not contain findings or 
demonstrate that Erum’s procedural violations were deliberate, which our 
caselaw requires if the violations underlie an order of dismissal with 
prejudice.  Chen, 146 Hawai ‘i at 179– 80, 457 P.3d at 818 –19.  The dissent 
selectively identifies particular events that may have delayed proceedings 
and declares that, taken together, they establish that Erum  was deliberately 
delaying the prosecution of his case.  Dissent at 42- 43.  But the dissent 
ignores the reasons for these events and the relevant contexts in which they 
occurred, which is a necessary consideration.  Here, the record contains 
Erum’s uncontested declarations establishing that his violations were 
inadvertent, and the circuit court never made any findings of deliberateness 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
41 
   Additionally, the record reflects that,  other than his 
inadvertent procedural violations, Erum has prosecuted his case 
with reasonable diligence.  Erum participated in discovery, 
filed motions and responded to motions filed by Llego, engaged 
in settlement negotiations, attended numerous hearings, moved to 
schedule trial, filed a pretrial statement, and monitored the 
court docket.35 
  Therefore, upon “review[ing] the pleadings [and] 
consider[ing] the entire case record,” wh ich was the stated 
                                                                  
(. . .continued)  
 
on Erum’s part.  All the delays the dissent identifies were either 
inadvertent or not caused by Erum, and the dissent’s ass ertion that Erum 
engaged in “creative dilatory tactics” is unsupported by the record.  See 
supra note 33.   
  The delays in this case were not so unreasonable or numerous that 
deliberateness can be conclusively inferred from their length and number 
alone.  Erum requested and duly received an extension to file his pretrial 
statement, both parties sought and received one continuance of trial because 
of ongoing settlement negotiations, and the case was ultimately dismissed 
only seven months after the initial trial setting.  As such, the length of 
delay was clearly not so inordinate that a deliberate intent to delay may be 
inferred.  Cf. Ellis v. Harland  Bartholomew and Assocs., 1 Haw. App. 420, 
428, 620 P.2d 744, 749 (1980) (dismissal upheld where, although there was no 
finding of deliberate delay, the record was voluminous with motions to delay 
and postpone trial and affidavit upon affidavit reciting plaintiff -
appellant’s unavailability for various proceedings).  We note that the 
dissent analogizes the length and number of delays in this case to those in 
Ryan, but the comparison is inapposite because Ryan does not define the 
parameters for inferring a deliberate intent to delay.  Dissent at 42.  There 
was no dispute in Ryan  that the violation in that case was inadvertent; the 
challenge was to the initial application of the Blaisdell standard to the 
dismissal of the plaintiff’s claim.  Ryan, 130 Hawai ‘i at 324, 310 P.3d at 
1025.   
 
 35 The ICA incorrectly stated that Erum refused to voluntarily 
dismiss his property damage claim.  Erum did not oppose Llego’s  motion to 
dismiss his property damage claim and instead sought to continue the hearing 
on the motion to dismiss until this court ruled on his writ of mandamus, 
which this court promptly did.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
42 basis for both the circuit court’s Dismissal Order and the ICA’s 
SDO, the record does not demonstrate that Erum deliberately 
delayed prosecution of his case.  The record thus does not 
support the circuit court’s dismissal of Erum’s case with 
prejudice on this basis or the ICA’s affirmance.  
2. Contumacious Conduct
In addition to deliberate delay, when a plaintiff’s 
contumacious conduct results in actual prejudice that cannot be 
addressed by a lesser sanction,  dismissal of an action with 
prejudice  may be justified.  Chen, 146 Hawai ‘i  at 179–80, 457 
P.3d at 818 –19.  This court has defined contumacious conduct as 
“willfully stubborn and disobedient conduct.”  Blaisdell, 125 
Hawai‘i at 50, 252 P.3d at 69 (brackets omitted) (quoting 
Shasteen, 79 Hawai ‘i at 108, 899 P.2d at 391).  Here, the only 
conceivable disobedience by Erum was his strategic decision not 
to submit pretrial documents, which the circuit court did not 
consider to be a rule violation.  The other instances of 
noncompliance with court orders or rules of procedure were, as 
discussed above, the inadvertent product of Erum’s advanced age,  
lapses in memory, and medical condition.  Significantly, there 
are no findings of fact from the circuit court that Erum engaged  
in contumacious conduct and that the motion to dismiss was 
granted on that basis.  See Blaisdell, 125 Hawai‘ i at 50, 252 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
43 P.3d at 69 (“Without evidence that Blaisdell conducted himself
in a willfully defiant manner, his actions did not amount to 
what this court considers ‘cont umacious conduct.’”); Ryan, 130 
Hawai‘i at 324,  310 P.3d at 1025 (finding it was an abuse of 
discretion to dismiss the plaintiff’s case with prejudice when 
the record did not show a deliberate attempt to delay or actions 
rising to the level of contumacious  conduct, and the circuit 
court did not make any such finding).  Rather, Erum’s 
uncontested declarations show that he was making good faith 
efforts to participate in the proceedings, and the record does 
not show that he was willfully stubborn and disobedie nt such 
that his actions constituted contumacious conduct.  Shasteen , 79 
Hawai‘i at 108, 899 P.2d at 391 (“ [T]here is no indication in the 
record that the Shasteen  corporation’s failure to secure 
substitute counsel, to attend the settlement conference with 
counsel, or to reschedule the conference constituted 
contumacious conduct  . . . .”).  Thus, the circuit court’s 
dismissal with prejudice of Erum’s case cannot be supported on 
this basis  as well. 
3. Actual Prejudice
As stated, actual prejudice that cannot be addressed 
through a lesser sanction is also a necessary precondition to 
the sound dismissal of a complaint with prejudice.  Chen, 146 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
44 
 Hawai‘i at 179-80, 457 P.3d at 818 -19; see also  Blaisdell, 125 
Hawai‘i at 49, 252 P.3d at 68.  If the party seeking dismissal 
demonstrates that the plaintiff has deliberately delayed 
prosecution of the case, that party is entitled to a presumption 
of prejudice that is rebuttable upon a showing that actual 
prejudice did not occur.  Blaisdell , 125 Hawai‘i at 49, 252 P.3d 
at 68.  Although it is unnecessary to consider whether Llego 
suffered actual prejudice in light of our conclusion that there 
was no deliberate delay or contumacious conduct in this case, we 
nevertheless address the instances of
 actual prejudice Llego 
asserted that he suffered in order to provide guidance as to the 
proper consideration of this component of the standard for 
involuntary dismissal of a complaint.   
  Actual prejudice in this context does not mean mere 
inconvenience, hardship, or expenditure imposed upon the 
defendant.  Actual prejudice is “ [d]amage or detriment to one’s 
legal rights or claims.”  Prejudice , Black’s Law Dictionary 1428 
(11th ed. 2019).  In Anderson v. Air West, Inc., discussed by 
this court in Blaisdell, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the federal 
district court’s dismissal with prejudice of a plaintiff’s claim 
for failure to prosecute pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
45 
 Procedure (FRCP) Rule 41(b) (1968).36  542 F.2d 522 , 523-34 (9th 
Cir. 1976).  The district court in Anderson found that the 
plaintiff’s failure to serve several of the named defendants 
until approximately one year after the complaint had been filed 
caused actual prejudice because the death of two of the 
defendants six months after process was served prevented them 
from contributing to the preparation of the defense.  Id.  at 
525.  “Prejudice is clear” the court stated, “because if service 
had been made promptly they would have been able to participate 
in the first 18 months of defense planning.”  Id.   
  This court discussed the actual prejudice necessary to 
support a dismissal with prejudice in Bagalay v. Lahaina 
Restoration Foundation, 60 Haw. 125, 138, 588 P.2d 416, 425 
(1978).  In Bagalay, the circuit court, pursuant to RCCH Rule 
12(f), dismissed the plaintiff’s claim with prejudice because of 
the plaintiff’s repeated failures to submit a proper statement 
of readiness.  Id. at 137- 38, 588 P.2d at 424- 25.  On appeal we 
                     
 36 FRCP Rule 41(b) (2007), which has not been amended since 
Anderson, states as follows:  
 
Involuntary Dismissal; Effect.   If the plaintiff fails to 
prosecute or to comply with these rules or a court order, a 
defendant may move to dismiss the action or any claim 
against it.  Unless the dismissal order states otherwise, a 
dismissal under this subdivision (b) and any dismissal not 
under this rule-- except one for lack of jurisdiction, 
improper venue, or failure to join a party under Rule 19--
operates as an adjudication on the merits.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
46 
 reversed the court’s dismissal, in part because the record did 
not indicate that the delay caused the defendants to suffer 
actual prejudice.  Id . at 142, 588 P.2d at 427.  Our decision 
explained that although delay generally has a detrimental effect 
on the preservation of evidence and the maintenance of 
communication with witnesses, all parties in the case were able 
to participate fully in the discovery proceedings and take 
depositions of potential witnesses.  Id.  at 138, 588 P.2d at 
425.  We further observed that there was no indication in the 
record that “circumstances have changed which have impaired 
appellees’  ability to adequately present their defense.”  Id.  
Accordingly, our precedent establishes that the actual prejudice 
a defendant must suffer is actual damage or detriment to the 
presentation of the defense.   
  In his motions to dismiss before the circuit court, 
Llego asserted that he suffered actual prejudice because the 
delays in this case caused both him and his counsel to expend 
additional time and resources.  However, there were no findings 
or other evidence in the record indicating that any of the 
asserted additional costs imposed on Llego by the delays in this 
case affected Llego’s ability to present his defense.  The 
incurring of additional fees and costs that have no effect on 
the defendant’s ability to present a defense is not legal ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
47 
 prejudice and cannot alone support a finding of actual prejudice 
under Blaisdell.  Thus, the record does not show that any of the 
delays in this case caused Llego to suffer actual prejudice, and 
there were no findings to that effect.   
4. Inadequacy of Lesser Sanctions 
  In cases where a plaintiff’s deliberate delay or 
contumacious conduct caus es actual prejudice, the circuit court 
is also required to consider and explain why a lesser sanction 
than dismissal with prejudice could not adequately address the 
actual prejudice caused by the plaintiff’s conduct.  Chen, 146 
Hawai‘i at 179 -80, 457 P.3d at 818- 19.  In its Dismissal Order, 
the circuit court did not address the possibility of less severe 
sanctions or state any reasons why lesser sanctions could not 
address any prejudice Llego may have suffered.  As an 
explanation for its ruling, the Dismissal Order only states that 
the court reviewed the pleadings, considered the entire case 
record, and heard oral argument.37  As stated, “ [i]nvoluntary 
dismissals of a complaint with prejudice are not favored, and 
should be ordered only in extreme circumstances[ .]”  Blaisdell,  
at 49, 252 P.3d at 68.  The circuit court in this case should 
                     
 37 The “argument” was held at an ex p arte hearing at which only 
defense counsel was present.  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
48 
 have expressly considered the lesser sanctions available to it 
and explained why the circumstances were so extreme that a 
lesser sanction could not adequately address any actual 
prejudice Llego suffered.38  Id. at 50-51, 252 P.3d at 69- 70.  
Accordingly, the circuit court abused its discretion in granting 
Llego’s oral motion to dismiss without a determination that Erum 
had engaged in deliberate delay or contumacious conduct that 
caused Llego actual prejudice,  and the court erred by failing to 
explain the inadequacy of lesser sanctions.39  Consequently, the 
ICA erroneously affirmed the circuit court’s Dismissal Order.   
5. The Necessity of Making Relevant Findings  
  We next consider whether it is appropriate for the 
                     
 38 In order to address any actual prejudice caused by a plaintiff’s 
delay, the lesser sanction should be designed to encourage diligent 
prosecution of the case and, as necessary, compliance with the court’s 
orders.  Here, because Erum’s medical condition and advanced age led to delay 
in the prosecution of the case, the court could have considered, for example, 
permitting Erum to appear at the pretrial conference by phone or video, 
requiring Erum to have a relative or a friend to assist him in attending 
court proceedings, providing Erum with information as to entities that 
possibly could provide him the assistance of legal counsel, or utilizing 
other means to provide reminder notices to Erum as to court  dates.   
 
 39 The dissent concludes that dismissal was obviously the only 
sanction available to the court because Erum had been sanctioned five times 
with judgments entered in the amount of $10,946.77, and he had not satisfied 
these obligations prior to Ll ego’s oral motion to dismiss.  Dissent at 19 
n.10, 44- 45.  Although the dissent asserts that Erum was willfully refusing 
to pay the sanctions, there is nothing in the record to indicate that he even 
had the ability to pay the sanctions.  Erum’s request to proceed in forma 
pauperis and self- representation indicate that an inability to pay is the 
more likely explanation.  See supra note 12.  Additionally, as discussed 
infra, in imposing monetary sanctions “Hawai ‘i courts should consider the 
effect of sanctions upon a party’s resources in conjunction with a decision 
to levy sanctions.”  Kaina v. Gellman, 119 Hawai ‘i 324, 332– 33, 197 P.3d 776, 
784–85 (App. 2008). ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
49 
 circuit court, as it did in this case, to dismiss a case with 
prejudice without making any underlying findings of fact as to 
deliberate delay or contumacious conduct, actual prejudice, and 
the inadequacy of lesser sanctions.  While this court has stated 
that the record must clearly support an order of dismissal, we 
have not expressly required the making of relevant  findings.  
See Blaisdell, 125 Hawai ‘i at 49, 252 P.3d at 68 (“ If the record
 
does not show the requisite facts, an order of dismissal cannot 
be affirmed . . . .” (emphasis added)); see also  Shasteen, 79 
Hawai‘i at 107, 899 P.2d at 390 (“[D]ismissal of a complaint is 
such a severe sanction, that it should be used only in extreme 
circumstances where there is clear record of delay or 
contumacious conduct[ .]”). 
  However, with regard to a court’s consideration of 
lesser sanctions prior to the dismissal of a case, this court 
has made the rendering of findings a near-requirement.  In 
Blaisdell
, we stated that, “the careful exercise of judicial 
discretion requires that a [trial] court consider less severe 
sanctions and explain, where not obvious, their inadequacy for 
promoting the interests of justice.”  125 Hawai ‘i a
t 49, 252 P.3d 
at 68 (emphasis added and omitted ) (alteration in original) 
(quoting Schilling v. Walworth Cty. Park & Planning Comm’n , 805 
F.2d 272, 275 (7th Cir. 1986)).   Requiring a court to consider ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
50 
 and explain the inadequacy of lesser sanctions underscores this 
court’s frequent admonition that dismissal with prejudice “is 
such a severe sanction that it should seldom be used.”  Id.  
And, in the rare situation when a dismissal may be appropriate, 
a trial court must first carefully consider lesser sanctions and 
explain why they are inadequate to address the circumstances of 
that case.  See Enos v. Pac. Transfer & Warehouse,  Inc., 79 
Hawai‘i 452, 458, 903 P.2d 1273, 1279 (1995) (“ [S]anctions are 
not to be assessed without full and fair consideration by the 
court.” (quoting Simmerman v. Corino, 27 F.3d 58, 64 (3d Cir. 
1994))).  This is because “a dismissal with prejudice is 
inconsistent with this court’s ‘policy of affording litigants 
the opportunity to have their cases heard on the merits, where 
possible.’”  
Blaisdell, 125 Hawai‘ i at 51, 252 P.3d at 70.   
  It is noteworthy that when a court explains  why lesser 
sanctions will be insufficient to address the plaintiff’s errant 
conduct, it will necessarily entail describing the underlying 
conduct, the measures that were previously taken by the court to 
address the conduct, and the measures’ lack of success in 
remedying the situation.  In other words, the required 
explanation is nearly the functional equivalent of requiring a 
court to make findings.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
51 
   Additionally, this court has recommended that orders 
imposing sanctions in other contexts “set forth findings that 
describe, with reasonable specificity, the perceived misconduct 
(such as harassment or bad faith conduct), as well as the 
appropriate sanctioning authority (e.g., HRCP Rule 11 or the 
court’s inherent power).”  Bank of Haw aii v. Kunimoto , 91 Hawai ‘i 
372, 390, 984 P.2d 1198, 1216 (1999).  When an order imposing 
sanctions does not follow this recommendation, the appellate 
court is compelled to review the entire record for an abuse of 
discretion.  Fujimoto v. Au, 95 Hawai ‘i 116, 153, 19 P.3d 699, 
736 (2001).  However, we have stated that specific findings must 
be made in cases when it is warranted.   See, e.g. , Tagupa v. 
VIPdesk, 135 Hawai ‘i 468, 479, 353 P.3d 1010, 1021 (2015) 
(stating that prior to a statutory award of attorneys’ fees for 
a frivolous claim, the court must make a specific finding that 
all or a portion of the claims made by a party are frivolous); 
Fujimoto, 95 Hawai ‘i at 153, 19 P.3d at 736 (“Absent a 
particularized finding of bad faith, the circuit court abused 
its discretion in sanctioning the plaintiffs.”); Kunimoto, 91 
Hawai‘i at 389, 984 P.2d at 1215 (“It is well settled that a 
court may not invoke its inherent powers to sanction an attorney 
without a specific finding of bad faith.”) ; Kawamata Farms, Inc.  
v. United Agri Prods., 86 Hawai‘i 214, 258, 948 P.2d 1055, 1099 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
52 
 (1997) (affirming the circuit court’s award of attorneys’ fees 
because the court issued findings describing defendant’s 
discovery violations in detail) . 
 
 We have also stated that specific findings that 
describe the perceived misconduct serve multiple important 
purposes.  Enos, 79 Hawai ‘i at 459
, 903 P.2d at 1280.  First, 
findings permit a more meaningful and efficient appellate review 
as to whether “the trial court exercised its discretion in a 
reasoned and principled fashion.”  Id.  Second, findings assure 
the litigants, as well as the court, “that the decision was the 
product of thoughtful deliberation.”   Id.  Finally, findings 
clearly identify and explain to the sanctioned person the 
conduct underlying the sanction.   
  The  importance of these purposes is heightened in the 
context of a dismissal with prejudice because the sanction is so 
severe.  It is thus particularly critical that the trial court’s 
decision reflects informed and reasoned discretion, and that 
appellate review of such a dismissal be  efficacious and 
meaningful.  Fujimoto, 95 Hawai ‘i 
at 153, 19 P.3d at 736 ( “The 
circuit court’s finding of a bad faith filing--as expressed in 
its oral ruling from the bench
 . . . lacks specificity and, 
based on our review, lacks support in the record. ”).  Further, 
we note that the current standard requiring the appellate court,  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
53  
(continued. . .)  
 in the absence of specific findings, to review the entire record 
for abuse of discretion and only requiring an explanation of the 
inadequacy of lesser sanctions when the inadequacy is “not 
obvious” impairs the efficacy of appellate review and is subject 
to varied applicat
ion by the trial courts.  
  
These considerations lead us to conclude that whenever 
a case is involuntarily dismissed with prejudice, the trial 
court must state essential findings on the record or make 
written findings as to deliberate delay or contumacious conduct 
and actual prejudice and explain why a lesser sanction than 
dismissal with prejudice is insufficient to serve the interests 
of justice.40   
                     
 40 Minimal oral or written findings will suffice when  the cited rule 
provides the precise conduct in question that warrants dismissal and the 
order of dismissal or rule specifically provides the party with the ability 
to seek reinstatement of the case.  For example, RCCH Rule 12(q) allows the 
court to dismiss an action sua sponte with written notice to the parties if a 
pretrial statement has not been filed within 8 months after the complaint has 
been filed or if a trial setting status conference has not been scheduled as 
required by RCCH Rule 12(c).  “Such di smissal may be set aside and the action 
reinstated by order of the court for good cause shown upon motion duly filed 
not later than ten (10) days from the date of the order of dismissal.”  RCCH 
Rule 12(q).  If, after the entry of dismissal, the sanctioned party seeks 
reinstatement “for good cause shown,” it will be necessary for the court to 
more explicitly consider whether there was deliberate delay or contumacious 
conduct, and whether there is actual prejudice that cannot be addressed 
through lesser sanctions.  See RCCH Rule 12(q); Ryan, 130 Hawai ‘i at 324, 310 
P.3d at 1025 (vacating the circuit court’s denial of a motion to set aside a 
dismissal entered under RCCH 12(q) because there was no evidence that 
plaintiff’s failure to submit a pretrial statement was deliberate or 
contumacious, and nothing in the record showed prejudice to defendant); Chen, 
146 Hawai‘ i at 179-80, 457 P.3d at 818- 19 (holding that an HRCP Rule 55(c) 
motion to set aside entry of default is to be evaluated based on whether 
there has been a showing of good cause, and good cause exists if there was no 
deliberate delay or contumacious conduct causing actual prejudice that cannot ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
54 
   Accordingly, we hold that after the filing date of the 
judgment on appeal in this case, the circuit courts must enter 
findings setting forth the requisite facts underlying an 
involuntary dismissal of a case with prejudice based on 
procedural violations of court rules.  Cf. State v. Hussein, 122 
Hawai‘i 495, 510, 229 P.3d 313, 328 (2010) (holding that, after 
the filing date of the judgment, circuit courts must state on 
the record at the time of sentencing the reasons for imposing a 
consecutive sentence). 
C. The Circuit Cour t Should Have Considered Erum’s Emergency 
Motion to Reschedule Trial. 
  
The Hawai ‘i Rules of Civil Procedure “do not require 
technical exactness or draw refined inferences against the 
pleader; rather, they require a determined effort to understand 
what the pleader is attempting to set forth and to construe the 
pleading in his favor.”  Giuliani v. Chuck, 1 Haw. App. 379, 
385-86, 620 P.2d 733, 737-3 8 (1980); see also  Dupree v. Hiraga, 
                                                                  
(. . .continued)  
 
be addressed through lesser sanctions); see also  Blaisdell, 125 Hawai ‘i at 49, 
252 P.3d at 68 (noting that “the circuit court had authority to dismiss 
Blaisdell’s complaint, subject to the ten day reinstatement motion and a 
finding of good cause” under HRCP Rule 41(b)(2)).  The dissent asserts this 
distinction for rules and orders of dismissal that provide an ability to seek 
reinstatement is confusing, Dissent at 4 6, but this is merely an application 
of the practice this court and the ICA have followed when resolving the 
appeal of a dismissal with prejudice under a rule that permits reinstatement.  
See Chen, 146 Hawai ‘i at 179 -80, 457 P.3d at 818 -19; Ryan, 130 Hawai ‘i at 324, 
310 P.3d at 1025.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
55 
 121 Hawai‘ i 297, 314, 219 P.3d 1084, 1101 (2009) (“[P]leadings 
. . . are to be construed liberally rather than technically.”).  
This is particularly true when the court is dealing with pro se 
litigants, and it is well established that the pleadings of pro 
se litigants should be liberally interpreted in order to promote 
access to justice.  Waltrip v. TS Enters., Inc., 140 Hawai‘i 226, 
239-41, 398 P.3d 815, 828-30 (2016) (stating that courts and 
agencies have discretion to liberally construe and 
recharacterize the filings of pro se litigants in order to 
promote access to justice).   
In furtherance of promoting access to justice, we have 
stated that “pro se filings, even when ‘misbranded,’ should be 
reasonably construed in a manner that ‘results in identifying a 
route to relief, not in rendering relief impossible.’”41  Id. at 
241, 398 P.3d at 830 (quoting Mata v. Lynch, 576 U.S. 143, 151 
(2015)).  Thus, a court abuses its discretion if it construes a 
filing by a pro se litigant in a manner that prevents the 
                     
 41 Although Erum has been pro se throughout these proceedings, the 
dissent argues that Erum has no right to have his filings liberally construed 
because he is “a litigation -savvy retired attorney.”  Dissent at 53.  The 
record indicates that Erum became licensed to practice law in California in 
1968 after passing the bar, but that he never attended law school and does 
not possess a law degree.  Erum practiced law as a sole practitioner for 
three and a half years before returning to Hawai ‘i to care for his parents.  
After returning in 1972, there is no indication he has practiced law at any 
time in the past forty -eight years.  The dissent’s characterization of Erum 
as a “litigation- savvy retired attorney” does not present an accurate 
reflection of his background.   
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
56 
 litigant from proceeding when a reasonable, liberal construction 
of the document would permit the litigant to do so.42  See id. at 
239, 398 P.3d at 828.   
  In this case, after the court had granted Llego’s oral 
motion to dismiss and taken the trial off calendar, Erum filed 
an emergency motion requesting a continuance so that the court 
would have time to consider Llego’s motion to dismiss  
and Erum 
would have time to respond.  In his e mergency motion, which Erum 
apparently prepared after he became aware that Llego had 
“presented to the Court for its approval and signature a 
proposed order to dismiss this action,” Erum contended that 
Llego’s motion to dismiss should have been made in writing and 
that he should be allowed sufficient time to respond.  Although 
the motion was framed as a motion to continue, the court should 
have made a determined effort to understand what Erum was 
attempting to set forth and to liberally construe the pleading 
                     
 42 The dissent contends that we are broadening this court’s holding 
in Waltrip.  Dissent at 51- 52.  A close reading of the case indicates 
otherwise.  In Waltrip, this court concluded that Hawai ‘i courts and agencies 
have discretion to reasonably construe the filings of pro se litigants in 
order to promote access to justice.  Waltrip, 140 Hawai‘ i at 239- 41, 398 P.3d 
at 828-30.  We determined that the agency in that case had construed a filing 
by the pro se litigant in a manner that prevented the litigant from 
proceeding, even though a reasonable, liberal construction of the filing 
would have permitted the litigant to do so.  Id. at 241, 398 P.3d at 830.  We 
then held that the agency’s failure to recharacterize the filing required 
remanding the case to the agency so that it could properly dispose of the pro 
se litigant’ s filing in a way that facilitated the litigant’s access to 
relief.  Id.   
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
57 
 in a manner that did not foreclose the possibility of relief.43  
Waltrip, 140 Hawai ‘i at 241, 398 P.3d at 830.  This obligation 
was underscored by the fact that the court’s denial of Erum’s 
emergency motion extinguished the possibility of recovery on 
Erum’s claim.  See
 Villaver v. Sylva, 145 Hawai ‘i 29, 36, 445 
P.3d 701, 708 (2019) (finding that a pro se litigant’s request 
for an interpreter should have been interpreted liberally as a 
request to withdraw his admissions and file a late response, 
particularly since a more restrictive interpretation would have 
extinguished his only opportunity to recover on his negligence 
claim).  Had the circuit court done so in this case, the court 
might have considered the merits of the e mergency motion, which 
pointed to both procedural and substantive deficiencies 
underlying the granting of the dismissal motion.  Instead, the 
court denied Erum’s motion without a hearing and failed to 
construe Erum’s emergency motion in a reasonable, liberal 
                     
 43 The dissent posits that the circuit court in fact did consider 
Erum’s emergency motion, and there was no reasonable construction of the 
motion that would permit Erum to proceed.  Dissent at 50.  Under this 
hypothesis, the circuit court recognized the writing requirement of HRCP Rule 
7(b)(1), the due process implications of granting Llego’s motion ex parte, 
see supra note 20, and its failure to comply with applicable law, and yet 
still denied Erum’s emergency motion and upheld the granting of Llego’s oral 
motion to dismiss.  Manifestly, such a ruling would have been an abuse of 
discretion because it would have been based on an incorrect application of 
the law.  Gap v. Puna Geothermal Venture, 106 Hawai ‘i 325, 331, 104 P.3d 912, 
918 (2004) (“The trial court abuses its discretion if it bases its ruling on 
an erroneous view of the law[.]”).   
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
58 
 manner, which would have allowed reinstatement of the case and 
permitted Erum to proceed on his claim.44  Waltrip, 140 Hawai ‘i at 
241, 398 P.3d at 830.   
D. The Circuit Court Awarded  Monetary Sanctions Without Citing 
the Authority Underlying the Sanctions or Making Findings of Bad 
Faith.45 
  
In affirming the Order of Dismissal in this case, the 
ICA pointed to the fact that the circuit court had “awarded 
monetary sanctions against Erum five times” prior to dismissing 
the case.  By citing the monetary sanction orders, the ICA 
indicated that the Dismissal Order was justified at least in 
part because of the previous  sanctions the circuit court had 
imposed on Erum.  In light of the ICA’s reliance on the monetary 
sanction orders as support for its affirmanc e, and the 
possibility of their future consideration on remand, it is 
appropriate to review our precedent in this area.   
  It is settled law that the trial courts of this state 
are empowered in appropriate circumstances to impose  monetary 
sanctions on a party during the course of litigation.  Kunimoto , 
                     
 44 In view of our disposition of other issues in this case, we do 
not address whether the court’s failure to construe Erum’s Emergency Motion 
liberally would also warrant vacating the Dismissal Order.   
 
 45 Because this case is being remanded to the circuit court for 
further proceedings, we provide guidance to the court with regard to the 
monetary sanctions that have been imposed. 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
59 
 91 Hawai‘ i at 387, 984 P.2d at 1213.  Such sanctions may be 
imposed under the authority of either a statute, a rule, or the 
court’s own inherent power.  Id.  The sanctioning order should 
set forth findin gs that describe the perceived misconduct with 
reasonable specificity,  and it must state the sanctioning 
authority.  Trs. of Estate of Bishop v. Au , No. SCWC -16-0000235, 
2020 WL 1150157 (Haw. March 10, 2020); Kaina v. Gellman, 119 
Hawai‘i 324, 331, 197 P.3d 776, 783 (App. 2008) (“[T]he court’ s 
order must inform the party of the authority pursuant to which 
he or she is to be sanctioned.” (citing Fujimoto , 95 Hawai ‘i at 
153, 19 P.3d at 736)) .  When the sanction order does not state 
the authority pursuant to w hich the sanction is imposed, the 
appellate court’s ability to  review the sanction is hindered.  
This is because the appellate court is forced to speculate as to 
the authority for the monetary sanction and consider whether the 
sanction’s imposition was proper under any potentially 
applicable rules or statutes, or even inherent authority, to 
determine whether the 
sanction should be affirmed.  See Enos, 79 
Hawai‘i at 457-60, 903 P.2d at 1278-81 (considering whether the 
circuit court’s imposition of a sanction should be affirmed 
under its inherent authority after finding it was not proper 
under HRCP Rule 11, which was the stated basis); Wong v. Frank, 
9 Haw. App. 249, 261, 833 P.2d 85, 93 (1992) (vacating and ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
60 
 remanding sanction order where circuit court did not specify the 
authority for sanction a fter determining  that regardless of 
whether the sanction was imposed under the circuit court r ules 
or the court’s inherent power, the sanction violated appellant’s 
rights to notice and hearing).    
 
 In this case, the circuit court imposed five monetary 
sanctions against Erum for the costs and attorneys’ fees 
incurred by Llego at various points during  the course of 
litigation.  None of the sanction orders recited the legal 
authority for the  imposition of the sanction.  While  a trial 
court has the inherent power to curb abuses and promote a fair 
process, including the power to impose sanctions in the form of 
attorneys’ fees for abusive litigation practices, the court must 
exercise its inherent power to impose sanctions “with restraint 
and discretion.”  Kunimoto , 91 Hawai ‘i at 387, 984 
P.2d at 1213.  
In recognition of the need for such restraint, this court 
requires a particularized showing of bad faith  as a necessary 
condition precedent to any sanction of attorneys’ fees under the 
court’s inherent powers.  Id. at 389, 984 P.2d at 1215; Enos , 79 
Hawai‘i at 458–59, 903 P.2d at 1279 –80.  Additionally, the 
finding of bad faith must be supported by clear and convincing 
evidence.  Kunimoto, 91 Hawai‘ i at 390- 93, 984 P.2d at 1216- 19 
(applying clear and convincing evidence standard to imposition ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
61 
 of sanctions based on finding of bad faith);  LaPeter v. LaPeter , 
144 Hawai‘ i 295, 309, 439 P.3d 247, 261 ( App. 2019) (“[T]he 
court
’s finding of bad faith must be based on clear and 
convincing evidence.”) .   
  Here, n one of the sanction orders contain a finding 
that Erum acted in bad faith.  The only referenc e to Erum’s good 
or bad faith was the court’s finding that Erum’s “actions in the 
settlement negotiations were not made in good faith.”  Our 
cases, however, have consistently held that the circuit court 
must find bad faith
 before impos ing an award of attorneys’ fees  
pursuant to the court’s inherent authority .  See, e.g., Gap v. 
Puna Geothermal Venture, 106 Hawai ‘i 325, 334, 104 P.3d 912, 921 
(2004).  A lack of good faith is not tantamount to  acting in bad 
faith, and the court’s conclusory statement  in this case is 
unsupported by any findings as to the basis of its  conclusion.  
Cf. Kunimoto, 91 Hawai‘i at 390, 984 P.2d at 1216 (“[T]hese 
findings are sufficient to enable this court to infer a specific 
finding of bad faith by the circuit court.”).   In addition, 
there is no basis to conclude that this sanction is supported by 
clear and convincing evidence.  
 
  Further, none of the sanction orders make any findings 
related to the reasonableness of Llego’s fees and costs .  The 
record does not disclose whether the fees and costs awarded were ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
62 
 reasonable under the circumstances.46  Manifestly, it would be 
inappropriate for the circuit court to award attorneys’ fees and 
costs that were unreasonably incurred under its inherent 
authority.  Cf. HRCP Rule 16(f) (allowing the court to sanction 
a party for “the reasonable expenses incurred because of any 
noncompliance with this rule, including attorney ’s fees, unless 
the judge finds that the noncompliance was substantially 
justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses 
unjust” (emphasis added)); RCCH Rule 12.1(a)(6)(ii) (permitting 
the court to order a party to pay the opposing party’s 
reasonable expenses and attorneys’ fees ).   
  In determining reasonableness as to the assessment of 
fees, “Hawai‘ i courts should 
consider the effect of sanctions 
upon a party’s resources in conjunction with a decision to levy 
                     
 46 For example, the record does not show that, before filing his 
first motion to dismiss, Llego made an effort to informally resolve Erum’s 
failure to timely file a pretrial statement, as the Guidelines of 
Professional Courtesy and Civility for Hawai ‘i Lawyers recommend.  See 
Guidelines of Professional Courtesy and Civility for Hawai ‘i L awyers Rule 8(a) 
(2018) (“Motions should be filed sparingly, only in good faith and when the 
issue cannot be otherwise resolved.  Specifically, a lawyer who manifests 
professional courtesy and civility . . . [e]ngages in more than a mere pro 
forma effort to resolve the issue before filing a motion [.]” (emphases 
added)).  Erum promptly filed his pretrial statement just nine days after 
Llego’s motion to dismiss w as filed, and he stated in a declaration attached 
to his opposition to Llego’s motion that he only became aware of his error 
after Llego’s motion to dismiss was filed.  From the record, it appears that 
the costs and fees incurred in making the first motion  to dismiss, which 
defense counsel averred to be in the total amount of $3,280.19, may have been 
avoided if an effort had been made to resolve the issue without resorting to 
the filing of a motion to dismiss.

 sanctions[.] ”  Kaina, 119 Hawai ‘i at 332 –
33, 197 P.3d at 784 –85.  
In Kaina, a wrongful death case, the trial court sanctioned the 
plaintiff for the defendants’  attorneys’ fees and costs incurred 
in defending a renewed motion for consolidation.47  Id. at 327-
28, 197 P.3d at 779-80.  As in this case, the sanction order did 
not state the authority under which the sanction was imposed.  
Id. at 328- 29, 197 P.3d at 780 -81.  On appeal, the ICA reversed 
the sanction order after concluding that the record did not show 
that Kaina acted in bad faith  in making the motion and that an 
imposition of sanctions against Kaina under HRCP Rule 11 would 
have been improper.  Id. at 330-33, 197 P.3d at 782- 85.  
Additionally, the ICA  noted that the circuit court had given no 
consideration to the effect of the sanction on Kaina’s 
resources.  Id. at 332, 197 P.3d at 784.  Kaina’s uncontested 
declaration indicated that she  was totally disabled, the sole 
provider for her own financial support, and lived on social 
security disability and a small pension.  Id.   The ICA stated 
that although a party’s resources, or lack thereof, is not a 
complete bar to the award of sanctions when sanctions are 
warranted, the court should take into account the effect of 
                     
 47 The circuit court had previously bifurcated Kaina’s claims 
against the defendants into two separate trials.  Kaina, 119 Hawai ‘i at 326, 
197 P.3d at 778. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 sanctions upon a party ’s resources when considering the 
imposition of sanctions.  Id. at 332-34, 197 P.3d at 784- 85.   
  In this case, the record does not provide any 
indication that the circuit court considered  Erum’s resources or 
what effect the imposition of sanctions would have upon him if 
monetary sanctions were awarded.  Although it  is unclear from 
the record what facts were before the court as to Erum’s 
resources at the time any of the sanctions were imposed, Erum 
was pro se throughout the proceedings,  and at minimum the court 
was aware that Erum was involved in bankruptcy proceedings by 
March of 2017.  In any event, at this time there is “other 
evidence pertinent to the issue” in the record,48 and the circuit 
court may properly consider Erum’s resources  on remand.  Kaina , 
119 Hawai‘ i at 333, 197 P.3d at 776. 
  
In light of our disposition vacating the Dismissal 
Order and remanding this case to the circuit court, and because 
the deficiencies in the record seriously impede our ability to 
review the sanctions awarded in this case, we vacate the 
monetary sanctions awarded against Erum.49  See Fuqua Homes, Inc. 
                     
 48 See supra note 12.   
 
 49 Although this court has in the past considered potentially 
applicable authority for a sanction imposed by a trial court and then 
determined whether the authority could support the sanction’s affirmance, we 
conclude that it is unnecessary to engage in conjectural analysis because the

 v. Beattie, 388 F.3d 618, 623 (8th Cir. 2004) (vacating and 
remanding the district court’s  sanctioning order because the 
court’s failure to identify the sanctioning authority made it 
“impossible to review the district court’ s order”).  On remand 
the circuit court may reconsider the sanction s awarded and, if 
warranted, enter appropriate sanction orders that comply  with 
the requirements outlined in this opinion.   
IV. CONCLUSION  
  Accordingly, we vacate the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal 
entered on June 28, 2019, the circuit court j udgment, the 
Dismissal Order, and the monetary sanction orders.  The case is  
                                                                  
(. . .continued)  
 
Dismissal Order is being vacated and the case is being remanded to the 
circuit court.  Cf. Enos, 79 Hawai‘ i at 457- 60, 903 P.2d at 1278- 81.  
Additionally, we note that some federal appellate courts, when presented with 
the appeal of sanctioning orders that do not state the authority pursuant to 
which the sanction was imposed, have rejected conjectural analysis and 
instead automatically vacate the sanction and remand the case to the district 
court “for specification of the authority on which the [district] court 
relied for imposing sanction and the particular conduct meriting such 
sanctions.”  Coltrade Int’l, Inc. v. United States , 973 F.2d 128, 132 (2d 
Cir. 1992) (vacating and remanding a district  court’s order imposing 
sanctions because although the record made it “abundantly clear” sanctions 
were justified, the district court failed to identify the sanctioning 
authority); see also Beattie, 388 F.3d at 623.
