 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY DEVENS, J. 
This appeal raises the question of whether the holder of a 
recorded judgment lien has a protected property interest 
pursuant to Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 636-3 (2016).  We 
answer this question in the affirmative. 
We further address the 
due process notice requirements owed to a junior judgment 
lienholder prior to an execution sale. We hold that such a 
lienholder is entitled to notice consistent with due process 
pursuant to article I, section five of the Hawaiʻ i Constitution.  
However, due to the potential impact of our decision on prior 
and pending execution sales, and considering the substantial 
prejudice to the intervenors, this decision, requiring that 
notice consistent with due process be provided to junior 
judgment lienholders who recorded judgments pursuant to 
HRS § 636-3, shall apply prospectively only. 
I. BACKGROUND 
This case concerns a property on Maui (Haleakalā Highway 
Property or the Property) in which Wade Brady owned a 50% 
interest. 
In 2010, Beverly and James Spence (the Spences) 
obtained a default judgment against Wade Brady and his wife, Katherine Brady, (the Bradys) in the amount of $152,350.62 in 
the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (circuit court).

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
March 9, 2011, the Spences recorded a judgment lien against Wade 
Brady’s 50% interest in the Haleakalā Highway Property with the Bureau of Conveyances (BOC). 
After the Bradys failed to satisfy their debt, the Spences 
obtained a writ of execution pursuant to HRS Chapter 651 on the 
Haleakalā Highway Property which authorized the execution sale 
of the Property to satisfy the Spences’ judgment.
2 
Prior to the execution sale, the independent civil process 
server in charge of the Haleakalā Highway Property’s public 
auction advertised and posted the sale by publication pursuant 
to and in compliance with HRS § 651-43 in four places: the Haleakalā Highway Property, the Makawao Public Library, Hoapili 
Hale (the location of the circuit court), and the Makawao Post 
Office. HRS § 651-43 required the posting of written or printed 
notice in three conspicuous places within the district where the 
subject property was located, but did not require personal 
notice to be served on any lienholders. 
HRS § 651-43 (2016). 
Wade Brady’s 50% interest in the Haleakalā Highway Property 
was sold to the Spences via Haleakalā
 Estate Properties, LLC for 
$25,001.00 at a confirmation hearing held on April 30, 2015, 
after the Property had sold at public auction on February 3,

2015. At the time of the sale, there were multiple encumbrances 
on the Property, which included two senior mortgages, the Spences’ judgment lien, and a junior judgment lien recorded by 
Peter J. Winn and Westminster Realty, Inc. (the Winn parties).
3 
The Winn parties did not receive personal or actual notice of the execution sale by public auction of the Haleakalā Highway 
Property. 
On June 3, 2015, the circuit court filed an order 
confirming the sale and conveyance of Wade Brady’s 50% interest 
in the Haleakalā Highway Property “free of all liens that are 
subsequent and/or junior to the lien of the Final Judgment, which is the judgment under which the Property has been sold in 
this case.” 
The Spences and their relatives subsequently 
acquired the other 50% interest in the Property, and, according to the record, are the current titleholders of the entire 
parcel. 
On February 6, 2013, approximately two years after the 
At the time of the execution sale, there were four liens encumbering 
the Property: a senior mortgage in the amount of $595,000.00 held by Finance 
Factors, Ltd.; a second senior mortgage in the amount of $592,000.00 held by 
Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS), as a nominee for First 
Hawaiian Bank; the Spences’ judgment lien; the Winn parties’ judgment lien; and an additional, subsequent judgment lien held by the Spences. According 
to the title report filed by the Winn parties, the mortgage held by Finance 
Factors, Ltd. no longer encumbered the Property as of May 30, 2017. However, 
the $592,000.00 mortgage loan executed with MERS, as a nominee for First 
Hawaiian Bank, remained, and the Spences executed a subsequent mortgage loan 
on the Property in the amount of $623,500.00 with MERS, as a nominee for 
Mangum Mortgagem Inc., d.b.a. Pacific Home Loans.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Spences recorded their judgment with the BOC and before the 
execution sale of the Property, the Winn parties also recorded a judgment lien against Wade Brady’s 50% interest in the Haleakalā 
Highway Property after they obtained a default judgment against 
the Bradys for $951,591.51, plus attorney fees and costs 
totaling $4,091.90. 
The Bradys failed to satisfy their debt with the Winn 
parties, and on May 23, 2017, two years after Wade Brady’s 50% 
interest in the Haleakalā Highway Property was sold at auction 
to the Spences, the Winn parties filed a motion requesting that 
a writ of execution be levied on the Haleakalā Highway Property
. 
The circuit court initially granted the Winn parties’ 
motion.4 However, the Spences intervened and filed a motion for 
reconsideration of the order granting the Winn parties’ writ of 
execution on the Property. Subsequently, the Winn parties filed 
a motion to amend the first writ of execution on the Property. 
At the hearing on the Winn parties’ motion, the circuit 
court concluded that the Winn parties were not entitled to actual notice of the Haleakalā Highway Property’s execution 
sale, the Winn parties’ judgment lien on the Property 
extinguished in 2015, and the Winn parties had “sat on [their] 
rights for many years.” Accordingly, the circuit court granted 
4The Honorable Rhonda I.L. Loo presided. 
5     
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the Spences’ motion for reconsideration of the Winn parties’ 
writ on the Property, and denied the Winn parties’ motion to amend their writ of execution on the Property. 
The Winn parties appealed the circuit court’s order to the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA). The Winn parties argued 
that as junior judgment lienholders, they held a 
constitutionally protected property interest in the Haleakalā 
Highway Property pursuant to HRS § 636-3, and that the execution 
sale deprived the Winn parties of their due process when it 
extinguished their lien without being afforded personal or 
actual notice of the public auction. 
The Winn parties argued 
that the statutory requirement of notice by publication was 
insufficient and that due process required “personal notice” of 
the Haleakalā Highway Property’s sale. 
The ICA vacated the circuit court’s order and held that the 
Winn parties’ recorded judgment lien against Wade Brady’s 50% 
interest in the Property, pursuant to HRS § 636-3, “created a 
property interest in the Haleakalā Highway Property.” Winn v.
Brady, 153 Hawaiʻ i 433, 436, 541 P.3d 653, 656 (App. 2023). 
Thus, the Winn parties were “entitled to notice consistent with 
due process when the Spences conducted the execution sale of the 
Haleakalā
 Highway Property under HRS Chapter 651.” Id. The ICA 
concluded that the notice by publication of the execution sale 
6    
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
pursuant to HRS § 651-43 was insufficient to satisfy due 
process, and under these circumstances, the Winn parties were entitled to personal notice of the sale. Id. at 441, 541 P.3d 
at 661. 
The Spences filed an application for writ of certiorari, 
which this court accepted.

III. DISCUSSION 
A. Junior Lienholders are Entitled to Notice Consistent with 
Due Process in Execution Sales 
1. A Writ of Execution is a State Action 
The Spences argue that the execution sale of the Haleakalā 
Highway Property did not constitute a state action, and 
therefore, the sale did not implicate the Winn parties’ due 
process rights. We disagree with the Spences’ contention and hold that an execution sale of a debtor’s property is a state 
action subject to procedural due process protections. 
In Hawaiʻi, the threshold question “[i]n evaluating the need 
for procedural due process guarantees” is whether “essentially 
governmental functions are involved in substance[.]” Kekoa v.
Sup. Ct. of Hawaiʻi
, 55 Haw. 104, 107, 516 P.2d 1239, 1242 
(1973). Here, the circuit court authorized the sale to satisfy 
the Spences’ judgment, and, while the auction was advertised and 
held by an independent civil process server, a judicial order 
authorized and confirmed the sale of Wade Brady’s interest in 
the Property. As the execution sale was judicially authorized, 
the sale of the Property was clearly a state action subject to the due process clause. 
The Spences also argue that based on the language of 
HRS § 651-1(c), which provides that “[n]othing in this chapter shall be construed to make an independent civil process server a 
8    
 
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
law enforcement officer, sheriff, or deputy sheriff, or an 
employee or agent of the department of law enforcement or the State,” the sale was not a state action. HRS § 651-1(c) (2016). 
However, HRS § 651-1(c) does not preclude or limit the 
judiciary’s role in execution sales. To the contrary, in 
obtaining a writ of execution on the Haleakalā Highway Property, 
the Spences sought and obtained the circuit court’s approval to 
execute on their judgment lien and to force the sale of the 
Property. Thus, the writ of execution levied by the Spences was 
a state action, and the creditors with interests secured by the 
Property were entitled to notice consistent with due process. 
2. A Judgment Lien Pursuant to HRS § 636-3 is a 
Constitutionally Protected Property Interest 
We agree with the ICA’s determination that the Winn 
parties’ recorded judgment lien pursuant to HRS § 636-3 created 
a constitutionally protected property interest in the Haleakalā 
Highway Property “within the meaning of the due process clauses 
of the federal and state constitutions[.]”

of Honolulu, 70 Haw. 361, 376, 773 P.2d 250, 260 (1989)). 
Whether a judgment lien pursuant to HRS § 636-3 creates a 
property interest is a question of first impression for this 
court. In Bank of Hawaii v. Shinn, this court noted that 
“HRS § 636-3 grants a judgment creditor an automatic lien on any 
real property of the judgment debtor.” 120 Hawaiʻ i 1, 4 n.8, 200 
P.3d 370, 373 n.8 (2008) (emphasis added). 
However, this court 
did not address whether HRS § 636-3 created a property interest 
“within the meaning of the due process claus[e].” See Protect
and Pres. Kahoma Ahupuaʻ a Ass’n, 1
49 Hawaiʻ i at 312, 489 P.3d at 
416 (citation omitted). 
HRS § 636-3 provides, in relevant part, that, 
[a]ny  money judgment, order, or decree of a state court or 
the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii 
shall be a lien upon real property when a copy thereof, 
certified as correct by a clerk of the court where it is 
entered, is recorded in the bureau of conveyances.  
HRS § 636-3 (emphasis added). 
In their briefing to the ICA, the Spences cited to Lindsey 
v. Kainana and In re Estate of Lopez, two cases that stand for 
the proposition that a judgment does not create a lien on a 
debtor’s property. Lindsey v. Kainana, 4 Haw. 165, 168-69 (Haw. 
Kingdom 1879); In re Estate of Lopez, 19 Haw. 620, 623 (Haw. 
Terr. 1909). However, as the ICA correctly noted, the precursor 
to HRS § 636-3 was adopted after our decisions in Kainana and Estate of Lopez, and therefore those decisions are inapposite.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
1913 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 32, § 1 at 36. 
The “fundamental starting point for statutory-
interpretation is the language of the statute itself.” Panado
v. Bd. of Trs., Emps.’ Ret. Sys., 134 Hawaiʻi 1, 11, 332 P.3d 
144, 154 (2014) (quoting First Ins. Co. of Hawaii v. A&B Props., 
126 Hawaiʻ i 406, 414, 271 P.3d 1165, 1173 (2012) (citations 
omitted)). “[W]here the statutory language is plain and 
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain and obvious meaning.” Id. “[I]mplicit in the task of statutory 
construction is our foremost obligation to ascertain and give 
effect to the intention of the legislature, which is to be 
obtained primarily from the language contained in the statute 
itself.” Id. “Only when there is an ambiguity in a statute are 
we to resort to other methods of statutory interpretation.” 
Barker v. Young, 153 Hawaiʻ i 144, 149, 528 P.3d 217, 222 (2023). 
The plain language of HRS § 636-3, which states that a 
recorded judgment “
shall be a lien upon real property,” clearly 
intends for a recorded judgment to be an “automatic” lien on real property. HRS § 636-3; see Shinn
, 120 Hawaiʻi at 4 n.8, 200 
P.3d at 373 n.8. The legislative history of HRS § 636-3 further 
supports this reading. The Senate Standing Committee report for 
the precursor to HRS § 636-3 specifically noted that the purpose 
of the bill was to “protect the judgment creditor from a quick 
11    
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
sale by his debtor.” S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 113, in 1913 
Senate Journal at 630-31. Thus, both the language and purpose of HRS § 636-3 clearly demonstrate that the legislature intended 
for judgment holders to be entitled to protections of their 
interest in a debtor’s property after properly recording a 
judgment. 
This decision is consistent with other jurisdictions with 
similar statutes that have likewise held that a judgment lien 
constitutes a protected property interest. See New Brunswick
Sav. Bank v. Markouski, 587 A.2d 1265, 1275-77 (N.J. 1991); Inre Upset Sale, Tax Claim Bureau of Berks Cnty., 479 A.2d 940, 944 (Pa. 1984); Cent. Tr. Co. v. Spencer, 535 N.E.2d 347, 349 
(Ohio Ct. App. 1987). 
For these reasons, we agree with the ICA and affirm that 
HRS § 636-3 creates a property interest for judgment creditors 
who have recorded said judgments with the BOC, and this property 
interest is constitutionally protected under the Hawaiʻ i 
Constitution. 
B. The Spences’ Compliance with HRS § 651-43 Did Not Satisfy 
Due Process 
If there is a property interest, this court must address 
“what specific procedures are required to protect it.” Protect
and Pres. Kahoma Ahupuaʻa Ass’n
, 149 Hawaiʻi at 312, 489 P.3d at 
416 (quoting 
Sandy Beach, 70 Haw. at 376, 773 P.2d at 260). 
12    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
“The basic elements of procedural due process of law require 
notice and an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner before governmental deprivation of a 
significant property interest.” Sandy Beach, 70 Haw. at 378, 
773 P.2d at 261. 
It is undisputed that the Spences complied with the 
statutory notice requirements under HRS § 651-43. The civil process server published notice of the public auction of the 
Haleakalā Highway Property in four places: (1) the Makawao 
Public Library; (2) Hoapili Hale; (3) the Makawao Post Office; 
and (4) the 
Haleakalā Highway Property. 
HRS § 651-43 provides, 
Advertisement for sale. The officer shall, after levy, 
advertise for sale the property levied upon, whether real 
or personal, for thirty days, or for such time as the court 
shall order, by posting a written or printed notice in 
three conspicuous places within the district where the 
property is situated, and if on the island of Oahu, by 
advertisement thereof at least three times in one or more 
newspapers published in Honolulu.  
We agree with the ICA that in the instant case, with our 
recognition that HRS § 636-3 provides a constitutionally 
protected property interest, the Spences’ compliance with 
HRS § 651-43 alone was not sufficient to satisfy due process 
principles under the specific facts and circumstances of this 
case. 
As established by this court in Klinger v. Kepano, “[a]n 
elementary and fundamental requirement of due process . . . is 
13    
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to 
apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections[.]” 64 
Haw. 4, 10, 635 P.2d 938, 942 (1981) (quoting Mullane v. Cent. 
Hanover Bank & Tr. Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314 (1950)). 
The ICA correctly held that notice by publication pursuant 
to HRS § 651-43 was insufficient to satisfy the Winn parties’ 
due process rights as the Spences knew, or reasonably should 
have known, that the Winn parties held a recorded junior 
judgment lien against the Haleakalā Highway Property as of 2013, 
two years prior to the 2015 execution sale. Further, the status report listing the encumbrances on the Property included a 
notice of the Winn parties’ recorded judgment lien. 
The Spences did not make a showing that it was either 
impractical or impossible to provide notice beyond publication. 
To the contrary, Peter Winn’s declaration asserts that he 
received phone calls from Beverly Spence prior to the execution 
sale of the Haleakalā Highway Property expressing the Spences’ desire to obtain Wade Brady’s interest in the Property and their 
knowledge of the Winn parties’ judgment. Beverly Spence does 
not contest Peter Winn’s assertions that she had Peter Winn’s 
contact information and that she telephoned him prior to the 
execution sale but did not inform him that the sale was taking 
14    
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
  
   
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
place. 
Under these circumstances, and applying the standard 
articulated by this court in Kepano, we agree with the ICA that 
personal notice to the Winn parties was required as the Spences 
knew, or reasonably should have known, of the Winn parties’ 
judgment lien, and further, based on the record, it is 
undisputed that the Spences had Peter Winn’s contact information 
prior to the execution sale.6 
C. This Ruling Shall Apply Prospectively Only 
For the first time, this court construes and recognizes 
HRS § 636-3 as creating a property interest subject to constitutional protections pursuant to the due process clause. 
Because our recognition that HRS § 636-3 provides a 
constitutionally protected property interest constitutes a new 
rule, we exercise our discretion and hold that the application 
of our ruling today shall apply prospectively only. See League
of Women Voters of Honolulu & Common Cause v. State, 150 Hawaiʻ i 
182, 207, 499 P.3d 382, 407 (2021). We diverge here from the 
ICA’s decision and reverse the ICA’s reinstatement of the Winn 
In certain cases, notice by publication may be sufficient for due 
process, but in general, notice by publication has been found sufficient only 
when other forms of notice are not practicable or possible. Eto v. Muranaka, 
99 Hawaiʻ i 488, 498, 57 P.3d 413, 423 (2002) (“Under Hawaiʻ i law, while ‘ such 
notice is disfavored[,]’ due process is not violated when notice is made by 
publication, when, ‘ in appropriate circumstances, notice by publication alone 
might be the only reasonable possible or practicable warning.’”) ( quoting 
Kepano, 64 Haw. at 10, 635 P.2d at 942
).  
15 6    
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
parties’ lien on the Haleakalā Highway Property. 
Although “judicial decisions are assumed to apply 
retroactively,” “[w]hen a judicial decision announces a new 
rule, this court may, in the exercise of its discretion, 
determine that the interests of fairness preclude retroactive 
application.” Id. (citations omitted). We are mindful of the 
impact this ruling may have on land titles acquired via an execution sale in which notice was not provided to junior 
judgment lienholders. Therefore, in order to “mitigate such 
impact,” and in consideration of the Spences’ reliance on 
HRS § 651-43 that only required notice and advertisement of the sale by publication with which the Spences complied, we hold 
that the applicability of our ruling today shall be restricted 
to cases where the writ of execution has been filed after the 
date of this decision. See Kepano, 64 Haw. at 15, 635 P.2d at 
946. 
In deciding whether this court should exercise its 
discretion and apply a new rule prospectively, this court 
considers “(a) the purpose of the newly announced rule, (b) the 
extent of reliance . . . on the old standards, and (c) the 
effect on the administration of justice of a retroactive 
application of the new standards.” League of Women Voters of
Honolulu
, 150 Hawaiʻi at 207, 499 P.3d at 407 (quoting 
State v. 
16    
 
 
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Jess, 117 Hawaiʻ i 381, 401-02, 184 P.3d 133, 153-54 (2008)). 
“The purpose of weighing these factors is to evaluate whether 
according retrospective application to a new rule would result 
in substantial prejudice.” Id.If application of the new rule 
will result in substantial prejudice, “the inequity may be avoided by giving the guiding principles prospective application only.” Id. (quoting Catron v. Tokio Marine Mgmt., Inc., 90 
Hawaiʻi 407, 411, 978 P.2d 845, 849 (1999) (citation omitted)). 
Applying this framework to the present case, the Spences 
reasonably relied on the requirements provided in HRS Chapter 651, specifically HRS § 651-43, which does not specify that 
junior judgment lienholders are entitled to special statutory 
notice. 
HRS § 651-43 was enacted in 1859 and has not been 
amended since 1886. CC 1859 § 1023. While the Spences either knew or should have known of the Winn parties’ junior judgment 
lien, the execution sale of the 
Haleakalā  Highway Property took 
place ten years ago, and the Spences reasonably relied on the 
express statutory language and publication notice requirements 
that existed at the time of the sale. 
We also weigh the extent of any prejudice to the parties if 
our holding were applied to the instant case. 
Based on Peter 
Winn’s declaration, it is evident from the record that the Winn parties knew, or reasonably should have known, of the Spences’ 
17    
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
judgment against the Bradys, of Wade Brady’s 50% interest in the 
Haleakalā Highway Property, and of the Spences’ intention to obtain Wade Brady’s interest in the Property. 
Yet the Winn 
parties did not move to execute on the Property until 2017— despite the Winn parties obtaining a writ of execution on a 
different Maui property jointly owned by Peter Winn and the 
Bradys (the Kolepa Property) in an effort to satisfy the Winn 
parties’ judgment. It was only after the Spences executed on 
the Haleakalā Highway Property, and the Spences and their 
relatives had acquired full title to the Property, that the Winn 
parties took action and motioned for a writ of execution on the Property. 
The Winn parties asserted that Katherine Brady’s bankruptcy 
proceeding contributed to the delay in seeking an execution sale 
of the Property. However, the record shows that the bankruptcy 
proceeding created minimal delay. 
For example, in June 2013, 
approximately two months after Katherine Brady filed her notice of bankruptcy in the circuit court, the bankruptcy court lifted the stay on the aforementioned Kolepa Property, and the Winn 
parties filed a motion for a writ of execution to be levied upon 
the Kolepa Property. 
Furthermore, the Spences filed their writ of execution on 
the Haleakalā  Highway Property in December 2014, more than two

years before the Winn parties sought a writ of execution on the 
same property. 
Since the execution sale, the Spences (along with their 
relatives Stephen and Valorie Spence) have engaged in additional transactions to obtain sole control and ownership over the 
Property. Reinstating the Winn parties’ lien on the Property 
would greatly prejudice the Spences, considering their reliance 
on the finality of the circuit court’s prior order, which 
confirmed the sale “free” of subsequent or junior liens, and 
their efforts after the execution sale to obtain joint title to 
the entire property with Stephen and Valorie Spence. 
Based on the equities and the Spences’ reliance on 
HRS § 651-43, we exercise our discretion in deciding the effect of holding for the first time that, pursuant to HRS § 636-3, a 
recorded judgment constitutes a property interest subject to due 
process protections. Aware of the impact of today’s decision on 
past public auctions pursuant to writs of execution, this 
decision shall apply prospectively only. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
For the reasons above, the ICA correctly held that a junior 
judgment lienholder with a recorded judgment pursuant to 
HRS § 636-3 is entitled to notice subject to constitutional due 
process protections, and under the circumstances of this case, 
19

the Winn parties were entitled to personal notice of the 
execution sale. However, the ICA erred in applying this rule to the instant case. Based on the Spences’ reliance and the 
substantial prejudice reinstating the Winn parties’ lien on the 
Property would pose to the intervenors, we hold that this 
decision shall apply prospectively to writs of execution filed 
after the date of this opinion. 
Therefore, we reverse the ICA’s January 18, 2024 Judgment 
on Appeal vacating the circuit court’s October 11, 2017 Order 
Granting Intervenors James E. Spence, Beverly C. Spence, 
Stephen R. Spence, and Valorie A. Spence’s Motion for Reconsideration of Order Granting Judgment Creditors Peter J. 
Winn and Westminster Realty, Inc.’s Ex Parte Motion for First 
Alias Writ of Execution.
