OPINION  OF  THE  COURT  BY  RECKTENWALD,  C.J. 
In 1976, the legislature enacted
 Hawai i Revised 
Statutes (HRS) Chapter 853
 to allow for the deferred acceptance 
of guilty (DAG) pleas. The legislature thereby sought “to 
establish a means whereby a court in its discretion may defer 
acceptance of a guilty plea for a certain period on certain           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
        
         
          
            
           
         
       
         
      
     
     
          
       
        
       
      
        
        
     
        
     
       
 
         
         
        
           
          
        
            
             
          conditions with respect to certain defendants[,] . . . 
result[ing] in the discharge of the defendant and expungement of 
the matter from [the defendant’s] record.” 1976 Haw. Sess. Laws 
Act 154, § 1 at 279. The legislature later amended HRS Chapter 
853 to allow for deferred acceptance of no contest (DANC) pleas.1 
1983 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 290, § 1 at 617. 
As the legislature explained, HRS Chapter 853 serves 
important policy goals and the availability of its benefits is 
specifically tailored in furtherance of those goals: 
[I]n certain criminal cases, particularly those 
involving first time, accidental, or situational 
offenders, it is in the best interest of the State and 
the defendant that the defendant be given the 
opportunity to keep [the defendant’s] record free of a 
criminal conviction if [the defendant] can comply with 
certain terms and conditions during a period 
designated by court order. Especially where youth is 
involved, a record free of a felony conviction, which 
would foreclose certain educational, professional, and 
job opportunities may, in a proper case, be more 
conducive to offender rehabilitation and crime 
prevention than the deterrent effects of a conviction 
and sentence. 
1976 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 154, § 1 at 279. 
HRS § 853-4 (2014 & Supp. 2018) sets forth the 
circumstances under which a defendant is ineligible to benefit 
from HRS Chapter 853. One such circumstance is where the offense 
charged is nonprobationable. HRS § 853-4(5). In State v. 
Hamili, this court determined that Prohibited Fishing with Gill 
1 Compare HRS § 853-1 (1977) with § HRS 853-1 (2014). As discussed 
below, we note that motions for a deferred plea are to be treated similarly 
whether or not the underlying plea is guilty or no contest.

     Nets was a nonprobationable offense because the use of the word 
“shall” in the applicable sentencing provision indicated three 
mandatory sentencing alternatives, none of which allowed for a 
term of probation. 87 Hawai i 102, 107, 952 P.2d  390, 395 
(1998). 
This case requires us to revisit Hamili and to consider 
the bounds of a trial court’s discretion in granting or denying a 
motion for a DANC plea.2 As discussed herein, we believe that 
the legislature intended for the benefits of HRS Chapter 853 to 
be broadly available to defendants, except where clearly 
articulated, deliberate exceptions apply. Applying those 
principles here, we conclude that the underlying offenses at 
issue in this case are probationable and Hamili is hereby 
overruled. 
In addition, although the grant or denial of a motion 
for a DANC plea is a matter within the discretion of the trial 
court, in the instant case, the court erred in denying Kaohulani 
Medeiros’s motion for a DANC plea. We therefore vacate the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals’ (ICA) Judgment on Appeal and the 
Circuit Court of the Second Circuit’s (circuit court) Judgment, 
Conviction, and Probation Sentence, and remand the case to the 
2 The concurring opinion contends that we are applying plain error 
review in our analysis. Respectfully, that is incorrect. It is of no import 
whether the State did or did not challenge Medeiros’s eligibility for a DANC 
plea during the sentencing proceeding. The circuit court would not have 
abused its discretion in denying the DANC plea if the offense was not eligible 
for a deferred sentence. Thus, we are required to address this issue, 
including whether Hamili was properly decided.

I. BACKGROUND3 
At  around  9:30  p.m.  on  February  24,  2017,  Department  of 
Land  and  Natural  Resources  (DLNR)  Officers  John  Yamamoto  and  Mark 
Chamberlain  approached  Medeiros  on  the  side  of  Pi ilani  Highway 
on  Maui,  on  suspicion  that  Medeiros
  may  have  been  night  hunting 
using  artificial  light,  in  violation  of  the  Hawai i 
Administrative  Rules  (HAR).   Medeiros  was  dressed  in  a  camouflage 
t-shirt  and  admitted  to  Officer  Yamamoto  that  “he  was 
spotlighting.”   Officer  Yamamoto  seized  a  headlamp,  an  unloaded 
rifle,  a  magazine  containing  ammunition,  and  a  case  of  bullets 
from  Medeiros’s  truck.  4 
The State charged Medeiros by Felony Information and
 
Non-Felony Complaint with the following four counts: 
Count I: Place to Keep Unloaded  Firearms  Other Than
Pistol  and  Revolvers,  a  class  C
  felony,  in 
violation  of  HRS  §  134-24(a)  (2011);        
Count II: Place  to
  Keep  Ammunition,  a
  misdemea nor,  in
violation  of  HRS  §  134-27(a)  (2011);  
3 The facts contained herein are from the testimony of Department of 
Land and Natural Resources Officers John Yamamoto and Mark Chamberlain, 
elicited at a hearing on a motion that Medeiros filed to suppress all 
statements that he made to the officers, as well as evidence seized from his 
vehicle. The circuit court denied the motion. Medeiros did not testify at 
the hearing, and there was no trial in this case. Defense counsel cross-
examined the officers, but did not offer any testimony or evidence to 
substantively contradict the officers’ testimony. 
4 According to Officer Yamamoto, “spotlighting” refers to “panning 
[a] light up, down, side to side looking for various animals,” in connection 
with night hunting.

  Count III: Hunting  Hours,  a  petty  misdemeanor,  in
violation
  of  HAR  §  13-123-6;  and  
Count IV: Artificial  Light  Prohibited,  a  petty
 
misdemeanor,  in
  violation  of  HAR  §  13-123-7.5 
A. Circuit Court Proceedings 
Medeiros  entered   an  initial   plea  of  not  guilty  as  to 
all
  four  counts.   He  subsequently  filed  a  motion  to  suppress  “all 
evidence  obtained  by  law  enforcement  officers  of  the  state  [DLNR] 
arising  out  of  an  investigative  detention  of  [Medeiros]  on 
Pi ilani  Highway  on  Feb[ruary]  24,  2017[,]”  including  all  
statements  made  by  Medeiros  and  all  physical  evidence  seized  from 
his  truck.   The  circuit  court held  a  hearing  on  the  matter,  at 
which  Officers  Yamamoto  and  Chamberlain  testified.  7 6 
1. Suppression Hearing 
Officer   Yamamoto   testified   that  at  around  9:00  pm  on 
February   24,  2017,  he  and  Officer   Chamberlain  were  patrolling  an
area
  between  Kaupō  and  Ulupalakua   for  hunting   and  fishing 
violations.    Officer   Yamamoto   testified   that  he  and  Officer  
5 HAR § 13-123-6 provides: “Hunting is permitted from one-half hour 
before sunrise to one-half hour after sunset. No person shall hunt from one-
half hour after sunset to one-half hour before sunrise except where specified 
differently.” 
HAR § 13-123-7 provides: “No person shall hunt game mammals with 
the use of artificial light, except as optical sighting devices during 
authorized hunting hours.” 
6 The Honorable Rhonda I.L. Loo presided. 
7 Officer Chamberlain corroborated Officer Yamamoto’s testimony. 
Because Officer Chamberlain’s testimony is duplicative, we do not include it 
in this opinion.

                   Chamberlain stopped at an elevated vantage point with a clear, 
unobstructed view of the area. Officer Yamamoto observed a gray 
Toyota pickup truck pass by and “[u]pon the Toyota coming up on 
the other horizon across [] the valley, . . . [he] started seeing 
panning of a light.” 
Officer Yamamoto testified that the light was coming 
from the driver’s side of the vehicle, which was slowly moving 
down Pi ilani Highway, “heading towards  Kaupo/Hana.” Officer 
Yamamoto explained that spotlighting is a “common act of a hunter 
[engaged in] night hunting. They tend to look for animals on the 
side of the road.” He further explained that the truck’s slow 
maneuvering was “an act that’s consistent [with what] a night 
hunter would do.” Because spotlighting is “pretty common with 
night hunting in that area,” Officer Yamamoto suspected that 
there “could be possibly night hunting going on[.]” 
Officer Yamamoto testified that after observing the 
truck for about two minutes, he and Officer Chamberlain got into 
separate vehicles and headed toward it. Officer Yamamoto 
admitted that he lost sight of the truck for about fifteen 
minutes, until he noticed a gray Toyota pickup truck traveling in 
the opposite direction. The truck turned left in front of 
Officer Yamamoto, onto the shoulder. Although Officer Yamamoto 
could not say for sure that the truck on the shoulder was the 
same vehicle that he observed from the vantage point, it had the 
same general appearance, and Officer Yamamoto had only observed

       one  other  vehicle  - a  smaller  sedan  - on  the  road  that  night.   As
a  result,  Officer  Yamamoto  also  pulled  onto  the  shoulder.    
Officer  Yamamoto  stated  that   when  he  exited  his 
vehicle,  the  driver  of  the  truck  was  walking  towards  him,  wearing 
a  camouflage  t-shirt.   He  identified  the  driver  as  Kaohulani 
Medeiros.   Officer  Yamamoto  testified  that  he  told  Medeiros,  “the 
reason  why  we’re  here  .  .  .  I  won’t  lie  to  you.   What  we  observed 
earlier  was  a  light  panning  from  this  vehicle.”   Medeiros 
responded,  “I’m  not  going  to  lie  to  you  either.   I  was 
spotlighting.”  
Officer Yamamoto further testified
 that when he asked 
Medeiros if he had any weapons, Medeiros recovered a rifle and a 
case of bullets from the cab of his truck and stated that the 
magazine for the weapon “was in the cup holder between the 
driver’s seat and the passenger seat.” Officer Yamamoto 
testified that the magazine contained ammunition, but there were 
no bullets in the rifle’s chamber. Officer Yamamoto further 
testified that he recovered a headlamp “that was given to him as 
what was being shined.” 
According to Officer Yamamoto, Medeiros stated that he 
borrowed the rifle from his brother and was planning to go 
hunting the next morning. Medeiros also stated that he was 
driving home from work when he pulled over to urinate, and 
further explained that he worked in Wailuku and lived in Hāna. 
However, Officer
 Yamamoto testified that Medeiros’s truck was

        actually headed toward Wailuku, rather than Hāna, just before it  
pulled onto the shoulder. Officer Yamamoto issued Medeiros two 
criminal citations for “night illumination for hunting . . . and 
for night hunting.” 
The circuit court entered
 findings of fact, conclusions 
of law, and an order denying Medeiros’s motion to suppress. The 
circuit court’s findings of fact essentially restated the 
testimony of Officers Yamamoto and Chamberlain. 
2. Plea Agreement and Motion for a DANC Plea 
Medeiros entered into a plea agreement whereby the 
State would dismiss Counts I and II if Medeiros pleaded guilty or 
no contest to Counts III and IV. The plea agreement further 
provided that Medeiros would be sentenced to a $100 fine for each 
count. Medeiros filed a motion for a DANC plea, expressing his 
intent to plead no contest to both petty misdemeanor charges, and 
requesting that the circuit court defer acceptance of his no 
contest pleas, pursuant to HRS Chapter 853.8 Medeiros attached 
8 HRS § 853-1(a) (2014) provides that, upon a proper motion, 
(1) When a defendant voluntarily pleads guilty or 
nolo contendere, prior to commencement of trial, 
to a felony, misdemeanor, or petty misdemeanor; 
(2) It appears to the court that the defendant is 
not likely again to engage in a criminal course 
of conduct; and 
(3) The ends of justice and the welfare of society 
do not require that the defendant shall 
presently suffer the penalty imposed by law, 
th
e court, without accepting the plea of nolo 
contendere or entering a judgment of guilt and with

           letters written  by his father and brother as exhibits to his 
motion for a DANC plea. The letters explained that the rifle 
seized from Medeiros’s truck was registered to Medeiros’s father, 
and that both Medeiros and his brother had permission to use and 
transport it. 
At a hearing on Medeiros’s change of plea and 
sentencing, the circuit court found that Medeiros “voluntarily 
enter[ed] pleas of no contest with an understanding of the nature 
of the charges against him and the consequences of his plea.” 
Defense counsel then requested that the circuit court grant 
Medeiros’s motion for a DANC plea, in consideration of the 
factors set forth by HRS § 853-1(a), because: 1) Medeiros 
voluntarily pled no
 contest to both petty misdemeanor charges; 2) 
Medeiros’s history showed that he would not likely engage in a 
future criminal course of conduct; and 3) the administration of 
justice did not require that Medeiros suffer any penalty, other 
than the fines set forth by the plea agreement and the conditions 
imposed for the duration of a DANC plea probationary period. 
Accordingly, defense counsel requested that the circuit court 
sentence Medeiros to a $100 fine for each count, pursuant to the 
plea agreement, and “continue the deferral pending the final 
outcome or payment of the $200.00 fine. In other words, if 
th
e  consent  of   the  defendant  and  after  considering  the
recommendations,  if  any,  of  the  prosecutor,  may  defer 
further  proceedings.  
9           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
        
   
       
           
         
         
           
     
         
         
       
        
      
           
   
           
         
     
         
             
       
         
 
           . . . . [Medeiros]  pays  $200.00  in  one  month,  then  the  [DANC  plea]
probationary  period  ends.”   
Medeiros  then  addressed   the  court  and  stated,  “[s]orry 
for  the  mess  that  I  got  myself  into.   And  you’re  not  going  to  see
me  in  here  again.   I  can  guarantee  that.   This  was  just  one  big 
misunderstanding.   And  I[’m]  sorry.”   
The  prosecutor  deferred   to  the  circuit  court  with
regard  to  Medeiros’s  motion  for  a  DANC  plea,  stating:  
Medeiros was honest with the DLNR officers that night. 
Um, he was honest. Maybe he didn’t quite know the 
law. 
[H
]e’s young. He’s 23 years old. He’s never been in 
trouble before. This is – he’s never been arrested 
before. I think that this is a huge learning 
experience for him. . . . I don’t think that we’ll 
see him in this courtroom again. 
He definitely has support from his family. I think 
his parents have been here with him every time in 
court. 
Mr. Medeiros, Sr. wrote a letter explaining the 
situation. . . . [P]erhaps this was a 
misunderstanding in that the Medeiros family doesn’t 
quite know the law and understand the law. I think by 
this point they do. 
And . . . so I’m comfortable that this was a learning 
experience for Mr. Medeiros. I don’t think that he 
will be back in court again. 
And so with regards to the request for a deferral, 
I’ll defer to the Court on that. . . . [T]he State is 
requesting, as pursuant to a plea agreement, the 
minimum fine, which is $100.00 on each of the petty 
misdemeanor counts. 
The circuit court found that Medeiros was “likely again

          . . .. to  engage  in  such  a  criminal  course  of  conduct,”  and  accordingly,
denied  Medeiros’s  motion  for  a  DANC  plea.   The  circuit  court 
explained  its  ruling  as  follows:  
[A]ll  I  have  before  me  is  basically  the  arguments  of
counsel  and  the  evidence  that  the  Court  heard  at  the
motion  to  suppress.9 
 
As
 far as the request for deferral under [HRS §] 853-
1[,] the Court has to consider whether a defendant 
voluntarily pleads no contest, which he has today, 
prior to the trial, whether it appears to the Court 
the defendant is not likely to again engage in the 
criminal course of conduct, and [whether] the ends of 
justice and the welfare of society do not require that 
the defendant presently suffer the penalty imposed by 
law. 
And the Court is concerned about the defendant’s . . . 
half truths, admitting that he was spotlighting, 
[while at] the same time saying that he was [going] 
home to Hana from work, when he was going in the 
opposite direction. 
The  Court’s  a lso  concerned  about  the  camouflage  wear,
the  .  .  .  location  where  this  took  place[,]  which  is 
known  for  night  hunting.   That  it  occurred  at  night, 
8:30  to  9:00  [],  which  is  definitely  within  the  time 
period  for  hunting  hours.  
And th
at the artificial light . . . was recovered 
along with ammunition, [the] magazine in the 
cupholder, as well as [the fact that Medeiros was] 
wearing [] camo[uflage] . . ., and the weapon [] found 
in the vehicle. 
9 Medeiros and the State had executed a stipulation and order 
waiving the preparation of a presentence investigation (PSI) report. At the 
hearing on Medeiros’s change of plea and sentencing, the circuit court 
explained to Medeiros that the PSI report would be “pretty thorough and [would 
give the court] a very good picture of [his] background and the kind of person 
[he is], and what [his] history is.” After conducting an extensive colloquy 
with Medeiros, the circuit court found that Medeiros “knowingly, intelligently 
and voluntarily waiv[ed] his right to have a [PSI report] prepared.” 
Accordingly, it entered the stipulation and order. 
11 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
The Court finds the defendant is likely again to
engage in such a criminal course of conduct.  I’m
going to deny [the] request for deferred acceptance of
no contest plea.
3. Judgment, Conviction, and Probation Sentence
The circuit court convicted Medeiros of Count III,
Hunting Hours, and Count IV, Artificial Light Prohibited - both
petty misdemeanor offenses.  HAR §§ 13-123-6, 13-123-7, 13-123-
13; HRS § 183D-5(a) (Supp. 2018).10  The circuit court imposed a
fine of $100 for each count, for a total of $200.  It also
sentenced Medeiros to two six-month terms of probation, one for
each count, to run concurrently.  11
Pursuant to a motion by the State, which was filed in
accordance with the plea agreement, the circuit court dismissed
with prejudice Counts I and II, the felony and misdemeanor
charges. 
B. Appeal to the ICA
Medeiros appealed to the ICA, arguing that the circuit
court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a DANC
plea.  In response, the State argued that Medeiros was ineligible10See supra note 5.
HAR § 13-123-13 provides: “Any person violating any of the
provisions of this chapter shall be subject to criminal and or administrative
penalties as provided in [HRS §§] 183D-5, 171-6.4, or 171-31.6.”
HRS § 183D-5(a) provides, in part, “Any person violating . . . any
rule adopted under this chapter shall be guilty of a petty misdemeanor [.]”
11The circuit court did not enter written findings of fact or
conclusions of law with regard to its denial of Medeiros’s motion for a DANC
plea.

    II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 A. Statutory Interpretationfor a DANC plea under HRS § 853-4(a)(5) because the offenses to 
which he pled no contest were nonprobationable. (Citing Hamili, 
87 Hawai i 102, 952  P.2d 390.) The State further argued that the 
circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying Medeiros’s 
motion for a DANC plea. 
The  ICA  did  not   address  the  State’s  argument  regarding 
Medeiros’s  eligibility  for  a  DANC  plea  or  probation.   With  regard 
to  the  circuit  court’s  denial  of  Medeiros’s  motion  for  a  DANC 
plea,  the  ICA  determined  that,  “based  on  the  record  in  this  case, 
as  well  as  the  information  and  argument  before  the  [c]ircuit 
[c]ourt,  it  did  not  appear  to  the  [circuit]  court  that  it  was 
unlikely  that  Medeiros  would  again  engage  in  a  criminal  course  of 
conduct.”   Although  the  ICA  acknowledged  that  “there  [was]  scant 
support  in  the  record  for  or  against  this  determination,”  it 
concluded  that  Medeiros  had  failed  to  show  that  the  circuit 
court’s  denial  of  his  motion  for  a  DANC  plea  constituted  an  abuse 
of  discretion.   Thus,  the  ICA  affirmed  the  circuit  court’s 
Judgment,  Conviction,  and  Probation  Sentence.  
 
 
“The  interpretation  of  a   statute  is  a  question  of  law 
reviewable  de  novo.”   Gray  v.  Admin.  Dir.  of  the  Court,  84 
Hawai i  138,  144,  931  P.2d  580,  586  (1997)  (citing  State  v. 
Arceo,  84  Hawai i  1,  10,  928  P.2d  843,  852  (1996)).   Our 
statutory  construction  is  guided  by  the  following  well-

          established  rules: 
When construing a statute, our foremost obligation is 
to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the 
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from 
the language contained in the statute itself. And we 
must read statutory language in the context of the 
entire statute and construe it in a manner consistent 
with its purpose. 
When there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or 
indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an expression used 
in a statute, an ambiguity exists. 
In construing an ambiguous statute, “the meaning of 
the ambiguous words may be sought by examining the 
context, with which the ambiguous words, phrases, and 
sentences may be compared, in order to ascertain their 
true meaning.” HRS § 1-15(1) (1993). Moreover, the 
courts may resort to extrinsic aids in determining 
legislative intent. One avenue is the use of 
legislative history as an interpretive tool. Gray, 84 
Hawai i at 148, 931 P.2d at  590 (footnote omitted). 
[The appellate] court may also consider “the reason 
and spirit of the law, and the cause which induced the 
legislature to enact it to discover its true meaning.” 
HRS § 1-12(2). “Laws in pari materia , or upon the 
same subject matter, shall be construed with reference 
to each other. What is clear in one statute may be 
called upon in aid to explain what is doubtful in 
another.” HRS § 1-16 (1993). 
State v. Koch, 107 Hawai i 215, 220, 112 P.3d 69, 74  (2005). 
B. Motion for a DANC Plea 
The grant or denial of a motion for a DANC plea is 
within the discretion of the [trial] court and will 
not be disturbed unless there has been manifest abuse 
of discretion. State v. Tom, 69 Haw. 602, 603, 752 
P.2d 597, 597 (1988). “An abuse of discretion occurs 
if the trial court has clearly exceeded the bounds of 
reason or has disregarded rules or principles of law 
or practice to the substantial detriment of a party 
litigant.” State v. Davia, 87 Hawai i 249, 253, 953

III. DISCUSSION 
Medeiros argues that the circuit court abused its 
discretion by denying his motion for a DANC plea based on its 
finding that he was likely again to engage in a criminal course 
of conduct. We agree. 
A. Medeiros Was Eligible for a DANC Plea 
As a threshold matter, we address the State’s 
contention that Medeiros was ineligible for a DANC plea because 
probation was not an authorized sentence for the offenses to 
which he pled no contest. 
We begin our analysis with a historical overview. In 
1972, the legislature undertook a “complete reorganization” of 
the State’s criminal laws, which was aimed at, inter alia, 
eliminating inconsistencies. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 1, in 1972 
House Journal, at 1035. This objective was advanced, in part, 
through the enactment of Chapter 706, which largely standardized 
sentencing. 1972 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 9, § 1 at 70-85. Pursuant 
to HRS § 706-600 (2014), “[n]o sentence shall be imposed 
otherwise than in accordance with [HRS] chapter [706].” The 
commentary on HRS § 706-600 states, in part: 
This section establishes that dispositions for all 
offenses - whether defined within or outside of the 
Penal Code - are to be imposed in accordance with this 
chapter and that, except for the power of the court to 
impose “incidental civil sanctions[,”] . . . as 
provided in § 706-605(4), “the only dispositions 
authorized are those permitted by the Code.” 
15           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
      
      
       
       
 
       
      
 
 
      
         
           
              
               
          
            
         
          
           
         
          
         
         
        
          
            . . . . Th
e Penal Code, in centralizing provisions relating to 
the disposition of convicted defendants in one 
chapter, differs from previous law which provided a 
separate sanction (fine or imprisonment or both) for 
each offense. 
By
 centralizing sentencing the Code seeks to achieve 
an internal consistency which is lacking under 
previous law. 
(Emphases added). 
Four years after the legislature reorganized the 
criminal laws by enacting Chapter 706, in 1976, the legislature 
enacted Chapter 853, which allows for DAG pleas. 1976 Haw. Sess. 
Law Act 154, § 1 at 279. And in 1983, the legislature added DANC 
pleas to Chapter 853. 1983 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 290, § 1 at 617. 
The statute provides the same process for entering both DAG and 
DANC pleas, and the same criteria apply to both. HRS § 853-
1(a)(1). 
The deferral period associated with a DANC or DAG plea 
is closely analogous to a probationary period. State v. Kaufman , 
92 Hawai i 322, 328, 991  P.2d 832, 838 (2000) (“Upon review of 
the legislative and judicial history of DAG plea procedures, it 
is clear that the DAG plea deferral period is closely analogous 
to a ‘probationary period.’”); HRS § 853-1 (allowing for the 
deferred acceptance of guilty pleas and no contest pleas without 
distinguishing between the two). It is therefore unsurprising 
that, pursuant to HRS § 853-4(a)(5), HRS § 706-620 and Chapter 
853 operate together to provide that defendants are ineligible to 
16           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
        
 
         
             
          
         
        
            
      
        
     
         
        
 
       
       
   
       
     
        
     
        
      
  
  
     
         
          
        benefit from Chapter 853 where the underlying offense is 
nonprobationable. 
HRS § 706-620 provides that “[a] defendant who has been 
convicted of a crime may be sentenced to a term of probation.” A 
defendant in a criminal case is eligible to be sentenced to 
probation under this section unless one of the six exceptions 
provided therein applies, or a clear indication of legislative 
intent to bar the application of HRS § 706-620 exists. The six 
excluded categories of crimes are as follows: 
(1) The crime is first or second degree murder or 
attempted first or second degree murder; 
(2) The crime is a class A felony, except class A 
felonies defined in chapter 712, part IV, and by 
section 707-702; 
(3) The defendant is a repeat offender under section 
706-606.5; 
(4) The defendant is a felony firearm offender as 
defined in section 706-660.1(2); 
(5) The crime involved the death of or the 
infliction of serious or substantial bodily 
injury upon a child, an elder person, or a 
handicapped person under section 706-660.2; or 
(6) The crime is cruelty to animals where ten or 
more pet animals were involved under section 
711-1108.5 or 711-1109. 
HRS § 706-620. 
Furthermore , HRS § 706-605 (2014) specifically 
authorizes a court, in its discretion, to sentence a person 
convicted of a petty misdemeanor to a suspended sentence or a 
term of probation. HRS §§ 706-605(1), (3). 
17           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
      
 
         
       
    
         
        
    
     
       
       
      
       
      
        
      
    In  Hamili,  this  court  determined  that  Prohibited 
Fishing  with  Gill  Nets  was  a  nonprobationable  offense,  pursuant
to  this  court’s  interpretation  of  the  applicable  sentencing 
provision,  HRS  §  188-70(a)  (1993).   87  Hawai i  at  107,  952   P.2d 
at  395.   The  provision  provided:  
Any person violating any provision of this chapter 
. . . or any rule adopted pursuant thereto is guilty 
of a petty misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof 
shall be punished as follows: 
(1) For a first conviction, by a fine of not more 
than $500, or by imprisonment of not more than 
thirty days, or both [.] 
HRS § 188-70(a) (1993) (emphasis added). 
This  court  determined  that   the  use  of  the  word  “shall” 
indicated  that  the  three  sentencing  alternatives  set  forth  by  the
statute  constituted  a  mandatory  sentencing  provision.   Hamili,  87
Hawai i  at  107,  952   P.2d  at  395.   Therefore,  this  court  concluded 
that  “a  DANC  plea  [was]  unavailable  for  persons  convicted  of 
violating  the  gill  net  fishing  statute.”   Id.   This  court 
explained:  
 
Because the sentencing court is limited to the 
alternatives expressly enumerated in HRS § 188-70, and 
probation is not an enumerated alternative, the 
offense for which the sentence is imposed is 
nonprobationable . Thus, HRS § 853-4(5), which 
provides that the DANC plea is not applicable where 
the offense charged is nonprobationable, prohibits the 
allowance of a DANC plea. 
Id.  (emphasis  added). 
Like  the  sentencing  provision   in  Hamili,  the  sentencing
provision  in  the  instant  case,  HRS  §  183D-5,  utilizes  the  word  
18           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
    
     
        
       
        
        
    “shall”  and  sets  forth  three  sentencing  alternatives.   Thus,  it
appears  that  Hamili  is  dispositive  of  the  inquiry  at  hand.  
However,  as  discussed  below,  we  conclude  that  Hamili  was  wrongly 
decided  and  we  hereby  overrule  it. 12 
This  court’s  analysis  in   Hamili  relied  heavily  on  State
v.  Dannenberg,  74  Haw.  75,  837  P.2d  776  (1992),  and  State  v.  Mun 
Chung  Tom,  69  Haw.  602,  752  P.2d  597  (1988).   However,  the  Hamili 
court  did  not  address  the  applicability  of  HRS  §  706-620,  and  in 
light  of  the  legislature’s  clear  intent  in  enacting  HRS  Chapter 
706,  we  find  that  the  Hamili  court’s  reliance  upon  these  cases 
was  misplaced.   The  sentencing  provision  in  Hamili  is 
distinguishable  from  those  at  issue  in  Dannenberg  and  Tom  because
it  lacks  a  clear  indication  of  legislative  intent  to  bar 
application  of  HRS  §  706-620.    
 
In  Dannenberg,  this   court  held  that  trial  courts  lack 
power  to  grant  motions  for  a  DANC  plea  in  prostitution  cases.   74
Haw.  at  80,  837  P.2d  at  779.   The  sentencing  provision  at  issue 
stated,  in  pertinent  part: 
Notwithstanding  any  other  law  to  the  contrary,  a
person  convicted  of  committing  the  offense  of 
prostitution  shall  be  sentenced  as  follows:   
12 HRS  §  183D-5(a)  provides,  in  pertinent  part: 
Any person violating . . . any rule adopted under this 
chapter shall be guilty of a petty misdemeanor, and 
upon conviction thereof, shall be punished as follows: 
(1) For a first conviction, by a mandatory fine of 
not less than $100, or imprisonment of not more 
than thirty days, or both[.] 
19           
         
       
      
   . . . . 
         
      
     
      
         
          
        
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(a) For the first offense, a fine of $500 and the 
person may be sentenced to a term of 
imprisonment of not more than thirty days; 
(b) For any subsequent offense, a fine of $500 and a 
term of imprisonment of thirty days, without 
possibility of suspension of sentence or 
probation . 
HRS § 712-1200 (Supp. 1991) (emphases added). 
This  court   noted  that  the  legislative  history  of  the 
provision  revealed  clear  legislative  intent  “to  limit  the 
discretion   of  the  trial  court  in  sentencing   prostitution   offenses
and  to  provide  a  mandatory  sentencing  structure  unlike  that  for 
other  petty  misdemeanors.”   Dannenberg,   74  Haw.  at  81,  837  P.2d 
at  779  (citing  Sen.  Conf.  Comm.  Rep.  No.  15,  1981  Senate  Journal,
at  907).   In  light  of  this  indication  of  clear  legislative  intent
to  exclude  prostitution  from  the  reach  of  general  sentencing 
provisions,  this  court  “construe[d]  ‘notwithstanding  any  other 
law  to  the  contrary’  in  HRS  §  712-1200  to  bar  the  acceptance  of 
DANC  and  DAG  pleas.”   Id.  at  83,  837  P.2d  at  780.   This  court 
explained,  “[w]e  do  so  because  we  believe  that  the  legislature 
did  not  intend  the  trial  courts  to  have  discretionary  authority 
to  avoid  the  sentencing  structure  the  legislature  has  imposed 
upon  prostitution  law  offenders.”   Id.  
 
 
Similarly,
 in Tom, this court held that it was beyond 
the trial court’s discretion to grant a DANC plea in driving 
under the influence cases because the underlying offense was 
nonprobationable. 69 Haw. at 603, 752 P.2d at 598. The 
20           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
sentencing  provision  at  issue  stated,  “[a]  person  committing  the 
offense  of  driving  under  the  influence  of  intoxicating  liquor 
shall  be  sentenced  as  follows  without  possibility  of  probation  or
suspension  of  sentence.”   HRS  §  291-4  (1985  &  Supp.  1987).   This 
court  determined  that  this  language  was  “sufficiently  clear  in 
mandating  the  sentence  to  be  imposed,”  and  thus  affirmed  the 
trial  court’s  denial  of  the  defendant’s  motion  for  a  DANC  plea.  
Tom,  69  Haw.  at  603,  752  P.2d  at  598.  
In  contrast,   the  plain  language  of  the  sentencing 
statute  in  Hamili  was  ambiguous  with  regard  to  the  possibility  of
probation  or  suspension  of  sentence,  and  as  to  the  application  of
general  sentencing  provisions.   As  such,  Hamili  is 
distinguishable  from  Dannenberg  and  Tom.   As  set  forth  above, 
through  the  enactment  of  HRS  §  706-605,  the  legislature  made 
clear  that  a  sentencing  court  is  authorized  to  grant  a  DANC  plea 
or  to  impose  a  period  of  probation  where  the  underlying  offense 
is  a  petty  misdemeanor.   HRS  §§  706-605(1)(a),  (3)  (“In  addition 
to  any  disposition  authorized  in  subsection  (1)[,  including 
probation],  the  court  may  sentence  a  person  convicted  of  a  .  .  . 
petty  misdemeanor  to  a  suspended  sentence.”).   Furthermore,  HRS 
§  706-600  and  the  commentary  thereto  indicate  clear  legislative 
intent  to  “centraliz[e]  sentencing.”   HRS  §  706-600  (“[n]o 
sentence  shall  be  imposed  otherwise  than  in  accordance  with  [HRS]
chapter  [706]).   The  Hamili  court  failed  to  analyze  these 
statutory  pronouncements  in  reaching  its  determination.   Upon  
 
 
21 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
further consideration, we hold that a clear indication of
contrary legislative intent must be present to exclude an offense
from the scope of HRS § 706-620, and that the use of the word
“shall” in the context of requiring a selection from alternative
sentences is insufficient to meet this standard.  We therefore
overrule Hamili.Because here, as in Hamili, there is no clear
indication of legislative intent to exclude the petty misdemeanor
offenses of Night Hunting and Artificial Light Prohibited from
the scope of HRS § 706-620, the offenses are probationable. 
There is no suggestion that Medeiros was otherwise ineligible for
a DANC plea under HRS § 853-4.   We therefore conclude that
Medeiros was eligible for a DANC plea.13
B. The Circuit Court Abused its Discretion by Denying
Medeiros’s Motion for a DANC Plea
Where a defendant is eligible for a DANC or DAG plea,
the court may, in its discretion, defer acceptance of the
defendant’s plea and impose conditions of deferment, provided
that: 
(1)[The] defendant voluntarily pleads guilty or
nolo contendere, prior to commencement of trial,
to a felony, misdemeanor, or petty misdemeanor;
(2)It appears to the court that the defendant is
not likely again to engage in a criminal course
13HRS § 853-4(a) sets forth the circumstances under which a
defendant is ineligible to benefit from HRS Chapter 853.  These include
specifically enumerated offenses and categories of offenses for which DANC and
DAG pleas are unavailable, as well as conditions pertaining to the manner in
which the charged offense was committed, and to the defendant’s criminal
history, that preclude application of HRS Chapter 853.

However, the grant or denial of a motion for a DANC 
plea may be set aside on appeal where there has been manifest 
abuse of discretion. Klie, 116 Hawai i at 521-22, 174 P.3d at 
360-61.
 
As discussed above, Medeiros was eligible for
 a DANC 
plea. The circuit court acknowledged that Medeiros voluntarily 
pleaded nolo contendere to the underlying petty misdemeanor 
offenses prior to the commencement of trial. However, the 
circuit court denied Medeiros’s motion for a DANC plea based on 
its finding that Medeiros was likely to again engage in a 
criminal course of conduct. 
Medeiros  did  not  testify  at  the  suppression   hearing  and
no  presentence  investigation  report  was  prepared.    Thus,  the 
only  information   before  the  circuit   court  at  the  time  of  its 
ruling  on  Medeiros’s   motion  for  a  DANC  plea  was:  the  testimony  of
Officers  Yamamoto  and  Chamberlain  elicited  at  the  suppression 
hearing ;  Medeiros’s  motion  for  a  DANC  plea  and  the  attached 
letters  from  his  father  and  brother;  the  arguments  of  counsel; 
and  Medeiros’s  statement,  “[s]orry  for  the  mess  that  I  got  myself
into.   And  you’re  not  going  to  see  me  in  here  again.   I  can 14

        guarantee that. This was just one big misunderstanding. And 
I[’m] sorry.” 
The circuit court explained its finding that Medeiros 
was likely to again engage in a criminal course of conduct as 
follows: 
[T]he Court is concerned about the defendant’s . . . 
half truths, admitting that he was spotlighting, 
[while at] the same time saying that he was [going] 
home to Hana from work, when he was going in the 
opposite direction. 
The  Court’s  also   concerned  about  the  camouflage  wear,
the  .  .  .  location  where  this  took  place[,]  which  is 
known  for  night  hunting.   That  it  occurred  at  night, 
8:30  to  9:00  [],  which  is  definitely  within  the  time 
period  for  hunting  hours  [prohibited].  
And that
 the artificial light . . . was recovered 
along with ammunition, [the] magazine in the 
cupholder, as well as [the fact that Medeiros was] 
wearing [] camo[uflage] . . ., and the weapon [] found 
in the vehicle. 
As such, it appears that the circuit court based its 
ruling on: 1) concerns regarding the  manner in which Medeiros 
committed the underlying offenses; and 2) the fact that one of 
the statements that Medeiros made to the DLNR officers at the 
time he was apprehended appeared to be inconsistent with such 
evidence. These were not sufficient grounds for the denial of 
Medeiros’s motion for a DANC plea. 
First, the circuit court
 expressed concern regarding 
certain aspects of Medeiros’s conduct at the time he was 
apprehended by the DLNR officers, including the location where 
the offenses took place, Medeiros’s camouflage t-shirt, and the 
24           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
         
         
        
        
         
         
        
       
            
          
         
 
       
             
          
         
         
         
     
          
          
           
         
         
          equipment that was seized from his vehicle. Although not 
explicitly stated, it appears that the circuit court drew an 
inference of sophistication from the way in which Medeiros 
committed the underlying offenses, and thus found an apparent 
likelihood that Medeiros would again engage in a criminal course 
of conduct. Even assuming that the circumstances of a 
defendant’s commission of the underlying offense could, in some 
instances, indicate a heightened likelihood of re-offending, we 
do not see how the facts cited by the circuit court here give 
rise to an inference that Medeiros was more likely to re-offend 
than any other DANC plea-eligible defendant charged with the same 
underlying offenses. 
Second, Medeiros’s statement to the DLNR officer that 
he was going home to Hana at the time he was apprehended does not 
constitute evidence that he is likely to again engage in a 
criminal course of conduct simply because the statement may seem 
implausible or inconsistent. In addition, as recognized by the 
State, “Medeiros was honest with the DLNR officers” when he 
admitted that he had been spotlighting. 
In sum, there was a lack of evidence before the circuit 
court to support its conclusion that Medeiros was likely to again 
engage in a criminal course of conduct. Moreover, Medeiros was a 
youthful, first-time offender and the only statement that he made 
to the circuit court consisted of an apology, acknowledgment of 
the “mess that [he] got [himself] into,” and a “guarantee” that

/s/ Sabrina S. McKenna he would not re-offend. Thus, in light of the entire record 
before the circuit court, its denial of Medeiros’s motion for a 
DANC plea constituted an abuse of discretion. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
As  discussed   herein,  the  circuit  court  erred  in  denying
Medeiros’s  motion  for  a  DANC  plea.   We  therefore  vacate  the  ICA’s
February  28,  2019  Judgment  on  Appeal  and  the  circuit  court’s 
October  12,  2017  Judgment,  Conviction,  and  Probation  Sentence.  
This  case  is  remanded  to  the  circuit  court  for  proceedings 
consistent  with  this  opinion.
