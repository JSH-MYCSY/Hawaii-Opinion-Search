OPINION OF THE COURT BY RECKTENWALD, C.J.  
   I. INTRODUCTION 
This case involves a nonjudicial foreclosure brought 
by U.S. Bank against Rosalinda Ganir Saplan and Recto Ramos 
Saplan (the Saplans) . After foreclosing on the property, U.S. 
Bank filed an ejectment action against the Saplans in 2011, but  
 
  
 
  
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
then it inexplicably dropped the ball. It failed to schedule a 
required pretrial conference, so the circuit court dismissed the 
ejectment action for want of prosecution . Two more lawsuits 
have followed, and now the parties still dispute who has title 
to the property. We must determine (1) whether claim preclusion 
based on the 2011 action prevents U.S. Bank from claiming title, 
and (2) which party bears the burden of proof in this quiet 
title action brought by the Saplans. 
In 2015, the Saplans brought the instant action to 
quiet title. They argued that the order dismissing the 2011 
action for want of prosecution was an adjudication on the merits 
that quieted title in their favor and that U.S. Bank could not 
claim title after that. U.S. Bank moved for summary judgment, 
arguing the Saplans had not submitted any evidence in support of 
their claim of title. The circuit court granted the motion. 
The Saplans appealed. The Intermediate Court of 
Appeals ( ICA) held that the 2011 dismissal was on the merits for 
the purposes of claim preclusion, but it nonetheless did not 
preclude U.S. Bank’s later action because the parties across 
these lawsuits were different . The ICA also held that summary 
judgment was improperly granted because U.S. Bank had not 
provided evidence that its foreclosure sale was fair, reasonably 
diligent, and in good faith, and the price was adequate,

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
pursuant to this court’s decision in Kondaur Cap. Corp. v. 
Matsuyoshi , 136 Hawaiʻi 227, 361 P.3d 454 (2015). 
U.S. Bank raises two issues on appeal. First, i t 
argues that the ICA erred in holding that the 2011 dismissal was 
on the merits for the purposes of claim preclusion . Second, U.S 
Bank argues that the ICA erred in holding that U.S. Bank had not 
met its burden of showing there were no genuine issues of 
material fact for trial . 
We hold that the ICA erred on both issues. First, we 
hold that without a final judgment , there cannot be claim 
preclusion. Here, there was no final judgment, so there can be 
no claim preclusion against U.S. Bank . Second, t he ICA 
incorrectly applied the summary judgment standard when it held 
that U.S. Bank had not met its burden. Because this is the 
Saplans’ quiet title action, the Saplans ha ve the burden of 
proof on the issue of property ownership . U.S. Bank met its 
summary judgment burden by presenting some evidence in support 
of its claim of title and sale, and by pointing out that the 
Saplans presented no evidence in support of their own claim to 
title. This is sufficient to shift the burden to the Saplans . 
Requiring U.S. Bank to meet the Kondaur requirements would 
subject U.S. Bank to a higher standard on summary judgment than 
our precedents require, effectively demanding the same showing

   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
it would take to prevail in the case if U.S. Bank were the 
plaintiff. 
We therefore vacate the ICA’s judgment and affirm the 
circuit court’s judgment. 
II. BACKGROUND 
In 2006, the Saplans purchased a residential property 
in Kailua-Kona and executed a promissory note with National City 
Bank for $475,200 , secured by a mortgage on the property. 
Rosalinda Saplan, her husband Recto Saplan, and Ricky Saplan 
owned the property as tenants in common , each with an undivided 
1/3 interest .1 National City Bank assigned the mortgage to U.S. 
Bank. By December 2009, the Saplans defaulted on the mortgage , 
and Rosalinda Saplan wrote to the bank stating she and her 
husband no longer occupied the property. In 2011, U.S. Bank 
nonjudicially foreclosed on the property via PNC Bank, to which 
it had given limited power of attorney . U.S. Bank sold the 
property to itself pursuant to a foreclosure sale in March 2011 
for $288,000. A quitclaim deed was recorded in the Bureau of 
Conveyances in July 20 11. 
Following the foreclosure sale , U.S. Bank filed an 
ejectment action in August 2011 to remove the Saplans and others 
1 Only Rosalinda Saplan and Recto Saplan are parties to this case.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
from the property. In August 2013, the circuit court dismissed 
the complaint sua sponte under former Rules of the Circuit 
Courts of the State of Hawai‘i (RCCH) Rule 12(q) (2015).2 The 
dismissal order noted it could be set aside for good cause 
within ten days . No party contested it , and no judgment was 
entered. 
In April 2014, U.S. Bank filed another ejectment 
action for summary possession and ejectment against the Saplans, 
Ricky Saplan, John Does 1 -50, and Jane Does 2-50. The record 
does not clearly reflect who was living on the property at the 
time, but the trial court dismissed Rosalinda and Recto Saplan 
as defendants, likely because Rosalinda had acknowledged in a 
2009 letter that she and her husband no longer occupied the 
property. The writ of po ssession was served on Ricky Saplan and 
Latasha Ortiz (the domestic partner of the Saplans ’ son, Riley) , 
2 RCCH Rule 12(q) was amended in January 2022 and is now RCCH Rule 
12(i). It read: 
Dismissal for want of prosecution. An action may be 
dismissed sua sponte with written notice to the parties if a 
pretrial statement has not been filed within 8 months after a 
complaint has been filed (or within any further period of 
extension granted by the court) or if a trial setting status 
conference has not been scheduled as required by Rule 12(c). Such 
dismissal may be set aside and the action reinstated by order of 
the court for good cause shown upon motion duly filed not later 
than ten (10) days from the date of the order of dismissal. 
The current version, codified at RCCH Rule 12(i), is similar . 
5  
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
concluding the case. U.S Bank sold the property to a third 
party in March 2015. 
In July 2015, the Saplans filed the instant case, a 
complaint for quiet title against U.S. Bank in the Circuit Court 
of the First Circuit.3 They claimed to be the true owners of the 
property. They argued that U.S. Bank’s 2011 ejectment action 
made “claims of Quiet Title and Ejectment” and that the claim 
had been dismissed with prejudice . The complaint also contained 
counts for ejectment, trespass, fraud on the court, unjust 
enrichment, and punitive damages. 
U.S. Bank moved for summary judgment.  First, it 
argued that res judicata barred the Saplans ’  quiet title and 
other claims.  Citing E. Sav. Bank, FSB v. Esteban, U.S. Bank 
argued that the three requirements for claim preclusion were 
met: (1) the 2014 judgment for possession was final and appealable, (2) there was privity between the parties because, 
even if the Saplans were dismissed from the 2014 action, they 
were in privity with Latasha Ortiz, and (3) the plaintiffs could 
have claimed quiet title in the 2014 action.   129 
Hawai‘i  154, 
159, 296 P.3d 1062, 1067  (2013).   U.S. Bank also argued that the 
Saplans’  claims were barred by mootness, laches, and estoppel.  
3 The Honorable Jeffrey P. Crabtree presided. 
6  
 
  
  
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
U.S. Bank further argued that the Saplans could not 
establish title to the property . Citing Maui Land & Pineapple 
Co. v. Infiesto , U.S. Bank argued that the Saplans needed to 
prove “either that [they] ha[ve] paper title to the property or 
that [they] hold [] title by adverse possession.” 76 Hawai‘i 402, 
407-08, 879 P.2d 507, 512 -13. U.S. Bank argued that the Saplans 
cannot establish adverse possession or paper title , attaching a 
corroborating declaration from its loan serving agent ,4 and the 
quitclaim deed obtained at the nonjudicial foreclosure . In 
response, the Saplans argued they were neither parties to the 
2014 action nor in privity with the defendants . They also 
argued that because a claim to quiet title could have been 
raised in the 2011 suit, and th at suit was dismissed on the 
merits, U.S. Bank was precluded from claiming quiet title in the 
2014 suit and the Saplans have a superior claim to title. 
The circuit court granted U.S. Bank’s summary judgment 
motion based on the following facts: (1) the Saplans defaulted 
on their 2006 mortgage loan; (2) a nonjudicial foreclosure sale 
occurred in March 2011; (3) PNC Bank bought the property at the 
4  The declaration stated that the property was sold at public 
auction to U.S. Bank, that the Saplans then vacated the property, and that 
the subsequent action went forward only against Ricky Saplan and Latasha 
Ortiz. The declaration further states that the property was subsequently 
sold to Konrad Ricken, a third party, by warranty deed. 
7  
 
   
 
  
 
 
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
foreclosure sale and assigned it to U.S. Bank; (4) a quitclaim 
deed was recorded in the bureau of conveyances in July  2011; (5) 
U.S. Bank prevailed on an ejectment action in 2014; and (6) U.S. Bank sold the property to a third party and a warranty deed was 
filed in March 2015.  
5 
The court rejected the Saplans’ argument that the 2011 
action determined ownership in the Saplans’ favor. It held that 
the RCCH Rule 12(q) dismissal was not set aside, so it operated 
as a dismissal on the merits. But the court further reasoned 
that the 2011 action was an ejectment action, not a quiet title 
action, and noted that the Saplans’ motion to dismiss was denied 
before the RCCH Rule 12(q) dismissal was entered. The court 
determined in a minute order that “[a]lthough ownership is a n 
issue in an ejectment case, a procedural dismissal of 
plaintiff’s ejectment claim does not automatically, permanently 
or affirmatively adjudicate that the defendant in the ejectment 
case actually owns the property.” It also observed that the 
Saplans had not raised any of these issues in the 2014 action. 
The court entered summary judgment for U.S. Bank in October 
2017. 
5 The circuit court found these facts were undisputed. 
8  
 
  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The ICA affirmed the circuit court’s decision that the 
dismissal of the 2011 action was an adjudication on the merits. 
It agreed  with the Saplans that RCCH Rule 12(q) governed. 
However, the ICA also held that “the Saplans failed to show that 
the parties in the 2014  [a]ction were the same as the parties in 
the 2011  [a]ction. ”   After the Saplans were dismissed in the 
2014 action, the writ of possession affected only Ricky Saplan 
and Latasha Ortiz, neither of whom were parties to the 2011 action.  The ICA  affirmed the grant of summary judgment on the 
Saplans’ fraud on the court claim
  and vacated the circuit 
court’s grant of summary judgment as to the remaining claims. 
The ICA held that U.S. Bank failed to establish that the 
Saplans’ 2015 claims (i.e. the instant quiet title and related 
claims) were precluded by the 2014 action, and that U.S. Bank 
failed to establish that there was no genuine issue of material fact.  6
   Quoting Ralston v. Yim, the ICA concluded that, as the 
party moving for summary judgment, U.S. Bank “may satisfy [its] 
initial burden of production by either (1) presenting evidence 
negating an element of the [nonmovant’s] claim, or (2) 
demonstrating that the nonmovant will be unable to carry his or 
6  The Saplans do not seek review of the fraud on the court claim 
and it is therefore no t discussed further.

her burden of proof at trial .” 129 Hawai‘i 46, 60, 292 P.3d 
1276, 1290 (2013). The ICA acknowledged U.S. Bank’s quitclaim 
deed and the declaration from its mortgage officer attesting 
that the property was sold to a third party. 
Quoting Kondaur, the ICA reasoned, however, that the 
quitclaim deed carries with it all the infirmities that the 
prior nonjudicial foreclosure might have occasioned upon the 
deed. 136 Hawai‘i at 241, 361 P.3d at 465. It held that a self -
dealing mortgagee was required “to introduce evidence that [it] 
exercised its right to [nonjudicial ] foreclosure under a power 
of sale in a manner that was fair, reasonably diligent, and in 
good faith, and to demonstrate that an adequate price was 
procured for the Property.” (Quoting Id. at 242, 361 P.3d at 
469.) The ICA noted that the mortgage officer had not attested 
that the foreclosure sale was conducted in a diligent and 
reasonable manner, nor had she made a declaration as to the 
adequacy of the price. It held that as a result, “U.S. Bank 
failed to meet its burden at summary judgment to show there was 
no genuine issue as to title of the Property” and that as such, 
“the burden never shifted to the Saplans.” 
10    In its  application for writ of certiorari, U.S. Bank 
raised  two points of error.  First, whether, in allocating the 
burdens on summary judgment, the ICA “improperly plac[ed] the  
 
    
 
  
  
 
  
    
   
 
   
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
burden of proof on defendant facing quiet title to establish 
that it possessed title to the Property.”  Second, whether the 
ICA erred in ruling that an “administrative dismissal” of an action was an adjudication on the merits for purposes of claim 
preclusion.  
In support of its first point, U.S. Bank cites Omerod 
v. Heirs of Kaheananui , arguing that the ICA improperly shifted 
the burden to U.S. Bank to prove title to the property. 116 
Hawai‘i 239, 172 P.3d 983 (2007). In Omerod, this court held 
that the defendant did not need to prove title to the property 
at issue because the defendant was not seeking a judgment 
quieting title; rather, the defendant could meet its burden by 
“pointing out that the record lack [ed] substantial evidence to 
support” the nonmovant’s (i.e., the party seeking to quiet 
title) claims. Id. at 252, 172 P.3d at 996. The court rejected 
an argument that the defendant needed to make a showing of title 
to prevail on summary judgment, holding that because the 
plaintiffs sought quiet title, they would bear the burden of 
proof at trial. Id. at 255, 172 P.3d at 99 9. As the moving 
party, therefore, defendants were not required to prove that 
they held title themselves, but instead to prove that plaintiffs 
“could not possibly prevail on the underlying claim. ” Id. at 
267, 172 P.3d at 1011. Accordingly, U.S. Bank argue d that the 
11  
 
  
   
  
     
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
ICA disregarded the quitclaim deed and the undisputed factual 
record establishing default, foreclosure, and sale of the 
property. In other words, U.S. Bank argue d, the Saplans would 
need to prove title at trial — and U.S. Bank has shown they will 
not be able to . 
U.S. Bank then argue s that the circuit court and ICA’s 
conclusion that the 2011 action was adjudicated on the merits 
was erroneous. First, U.S. Bank argues that in deciding whether 
a final judgment is on the merits for the purposes of claim 
preclusion, courts have considered whether the judgment was 
entered after the parties had the full opportunity to present 
their claims . See Dorrance v. Lee , 90 Hawaiʻi 143, 150, 976 P.2d 
904, 911 (1999). Since the 2011 ejectment action was dismissed 
for lack of a pretrial conference, there was no opportunity to 
present claims. Furthermore, U.S. Bank argues that there needs 
to be a separate final judgment before a matter is considered 
“adjudicated.” U.S. Bank claims that “whether an administrative 
dismissal under RCCH Rule 12(q), without a separate judgment , 
constitutes an adjudication on the merits” is a question of 
first impression. U.S. Bank warns that following the ICA’s 
ruling will produce “draconian results” in future cases by 
foreclosing review on the merits if a case is dismissed for 
procedural non -compliance. 
12  
 
    The Saplans disagree.   They argue that the ICA 
correctly applied precedent in requiring U.S. Bank to establish 
that the nonjudicial foreclosure sale was conducted in a manner 
that was “fair, reasonably diligent, and in good faith and that 
an adequate price was procured for the property. ”  Kondaur, 136 
Hawai‘i  at 229, 361 P.3d at  456.  Second, they argue that because 
U.S. Bank did not seek a final judgment or object to the 
dismissal of the 2011 action, the ICA was correct in holding 
that the 2011 action was a dismissal with prejudice.  The 
Saplans agree with U.S. Bank that a final judgment, including a 
dismissal, must be set forth on a separate document, but argue 
that because U.S. Bank did not object to the dismissal or seek a 
separate judgment after dismissal, the dismissal was therefore 
with prejudice under Hawai‘i  Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 
41(b)(3)(2012)7  and RCCH Rule 12(q).  
  
            
            
 
   
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
III. STANDARD OF REVIEW 
We review a circuit court’s grant or denial of summary 
judgment de novo. Querubin v. Thronas, 107 Hawaiʻi 48, 56, 109 
7 HRCP Rule 41(b)(3) reads as follows: 
Unless the court in its order for dismissal otherwise 
specifies, a dismissal under this subdivision and any 
dismissal not provided for in this rule, other than a 
dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, for improper venue, or 
for failure to join a party under Rule 19, operates as an 
adjudication upon the merits.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
P.3d 689, 697 (2005). We may affirm summary judgments on any 
grounds in the record, including those upon which the circuit 
court did not rely. Reyes v. Kuboyama , 76 Hawai‘i 137, 140, 870 
P.2d 1281, 1284 (1994). 
IV. DISCUSSION 
This appeal presents two questions: (1) whether the 
burden of proving title is on U.S. Bank or the Saplans at 
summary judgment , and (2) whether the 2011 dismissal was an 
adjudication on the merits for purposes of claim preclusion. We 
hold (1) the burden of proving title is on the Saplans in this 
quiet title action, and (2) the 2011 dismissal was not an 
adjudication on the merits. We accordingly vacate the ICA’s 
judgment and affirm the circuit court’s judgment. 
A. The ICA Erred in Holding That U.S. Bank Had Not Met Its 
Burden on Summary Judgment 
On summary judgment, 
the moving party has the initial burden of identifying 
those portions of the record demonstrating the absence of a 
genuine issue of material fact. The moving party may 
discharge his or her burden by demonstrating that, if the 
case went to trial, there would be no competent evidence to 
support a judgment for his or her opponent. 
Exotics  Hawaii-Kona,  Inc.  v.  E.I.  Du  Pont  De  Nemours  &  Co., 116 
Hawaiʻi 277, 301, 172 P.3d 1021, 1045 (2007) (brackets and 
emphasis omitted) (quoting Young v. Plan.  Comm’n of the Cnty .  of 
Kauaʻi,  89 Hawaiʻ i 400, 407, 974 P.2d 40, 47 (1999)).  
14  
 
   When the party seeking summary judgment is the 
defendant, who will not ultimately bear the burden of proof at 
trial, “summary  judgment  is  proper  when  the  non-moving  party-
plaintiff  fails  to  make  a  showing  sufficient  to  establish  the  
existence  of  an  element  essential  to  that  party’s  case,  and  on  
which  that  party  will  bear  the  burden  of  proof  at  trial.”   Id.  
at  302, 172 P.3d at 1046 (emphases omitted). “Only when the 
moving party satisfies its initial burden of production does the 
burden shift to the nonmoving party to respond to the motion for 
summary judgment and demonstrate specific facts, as opposed to 
general allegations, that present a genuine issue worthy of 
trial.” Ralston, 129 Hawaiʻi at 56–57, 292 P.3d at 1286 –87.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
U.S. Bank is the defendant in the Saplans’ 2015 quiet 
title action.  As the defendant, U.S. Bank does not have the  
burden of proof on the title  issue, as the ICA concluded.  U.S. 
Bank’s burden on summary judgment was to show that there was no 
way that the Saplans could show that they had title to the 
property. Id.  at 60, 292 P.3d at 1290 (moving party “may 
satisfy [its] initial burden of production by either (1) 
presenting evidence negating an element of the [nonmovant’s] 
claim, or (2) demonstrating that the nonmovant will be unable to 
carry his or her burden of proof at trial.”). While showing 
that there is no genuine issue to title of the property would 
15  
 
  
  
 
 
 
    
 
   
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
conclusively establish that the Saplans could not prevail at 
trial, this is a higher burden than our precedent requires for 
summary judgment in this context . 
The standard of proof for a quiet title action, which 
the Saplans would have to meet to prevail at trial, is as 
follows: 
In an action to quiet title, the burden is on the 
plaintiff to prove title in and to the land in dispute, 
and, absent such proof, it is unnecessary for the defendant 
to make any showing. The plaintiff has the burden to prove 
either that he has paper title to the property or that he 
holds title by adverse possession. While it is not 
necessary for the plaintiff to have perfect title to 
establish a prima facie case, he must at least prove that 
he has a substantial interest in the property and that his 
title is superior to that of the defendants. 
Maui Land & Pineapple Co., 76 Hawaiʻi at 407–08, 879 P.2d at 
512–13 (citations omitted). 
Thus, in a quiet title action, the burden is on the 
claimant to show a superior interest in the property to the 
defendant’s – through paper title or adverse possession. Id. 
In order to prevail on summary judgment, therefore, U.S. Bank 
had to show that there was no way the Saplans could prove they 
had paper title to the land or had adversely possessed the land. 
See Omerod, 116 Hawaiʻi at 267-68, 172 P.3d at 1011 -12 (because 
evidentiary standard requir ed of moving party depends on who has 
burden of proof at trial, defendant moving for summary judgment 
in a quiet title action need not make prima facie showing of 
title). 
16  
 
  
  
 
 
  
 
     
 
   
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The Saplans did not claim adverse possession. They 
claimed that they were forcibly removed from their property, and 
argued at the hearing that the letter Rosalinda Saplan wrote to 
PNC Bank in 2009 stating that she had left the property was 
inadmissible because it lacked foundation, and that the letter 
only applied to Rosalinda Saplan, not Recto Saplan. But the 
Saplans never claimed that they still occupied the property. At 
the summary judgment hearing, counsel for the Saplans did not 
respond to the court’s question as to whether the Saplans were 
occupying the property in 2014. The Saplans therefore cannot 
prove adverse possession at trial. 
The Saplans claimed they had title to the land, but 
the only support they presented for their claim was a legal 
argument: that the HRCP Rule 41(b)(3) dismissal of the 2011 
action had adjudicated title in their favor. Both parties make 
preclusion arguments against the other. Claim preclusion does 
not apply . See infra Section IV.B. Nor does i ssue preclusion 
apply because the issue of title was not “actually litigated” in 
the previous case. The Saplans did not present any evidence 
that the court had actually considered the issue of title and 
decided it in their favor in 2011, which our doctrine requires .

“actually litigated and finally decided”) (emphasis added). 
Absent any showing by the Saplans that title was actually 
litigated in th e 2011 action, the dismis sal did not quiet title 
in favor of the Saplans. 
The Saplans did not make any other claim to title. 
They did not challenge U.S. Bank’s foreclosure sale or the sale 
to a third party. They argued that U.S. Bank had not provided 
evidence that the property had been purchased by a bona fide third-party purchaser.  But it was the Saplans’ action, and 
therefore, it was the Saplans’ burden  to put forward evidence of 
irregularity in the sale or inadequacy of the price in order to 
support their claim.  
U.S. Bank provided uncontested evidence that the 
Saplans were in default on their 2006 mortgage loan; that a 
nonjudicial foreclosure sale occurred; that PNC Bank bought the 
property at the foreclosure sale and assigned it to U.S. Bank; 
that a quitclaim deed was recorded in the bureau of conveyances; 
that U.S. Bank prevailed on an ejectment action in 2014; and 
that U.S. Bank sold the property to a third party and a warranty 
deed was filed in March 2015. While U.S. Bank has not 
demonstrated that its nonjudicial foreclosure sale met the 
requirements of Kondaur, such a showing is not required. 
Kondaur applies only to a plaintiff or mortgagee seeking

ejectment — not a defendant in a quiet title action. See 136 
Hawai‘i at 243, 361 P.3d at 4 70. 
U.S. Bank met its summary judgment burden by 
presenting some evidence in support of its claim of title and 
sale, and by pointing out that the Saplans presented no evidence 
in support of their own claim to title. Therefore, the burden 
should have then shifted to the Saplans to show a disputed issue 
of material fact or that they were entitled to judgment as a 
matter of law . The circuit court considered the Saplans’ 
opposition to U.S. Bank’s motion for summary judgment and 
correctly determined that the Saplans were unable to raise a 
genuine issue of fact. 
B. The 2011 Ejectment Action Was Not an Adjudication on the 
Merits for Purposes of Claim Preclusion Because There Was 
No Separate Final Judgment 
19    Claim preclusion prevents parties from relitigating 
issues that have already been or could have been resolved in a 
prior lawsuit.  We enforce claim preclusion to protect the 
finality of judgments, conserve judicial resources, and shield 
parties from the burden and expense of multiple lawsuits over 
the same matter.  The party asserting it must prove three 
elements: “1) there was a final judgment on the merits, 2) both 
parties are the same or are in privity with the same parties in 
the original suit, and 3) the claim decided in the original suit

is identical with the one presented in the action in question.” 
Priceline.com , Inc. v. Dir. of Tax ’n, 144 Hawai‘i 72, 82, 436 
P.3d 1155, 1165 (2019) (citing Esteban, 129 Hawai‘i at 159, 296 
P.3d at 1067). 
Former RCCH Rule 12(q) read: 
 Dismissal for want of prosecution .   An action may be 
dismissed sua sponte with written notice to the parties if 
a pretrial statement has not been filed within 8 months 
after a complaint has been filed (or within any further 
period of extension granted by the court) or if a trial 
setting status conference has not been scheduled as 
required by Rule 12(c).  Such dismissal may be set aside 
and the action reinstated by order of the court for good 
cause shown upon motion duly filed not later than ten (10) 
days from the date of the order of dismissal.  
The ICA affirmed the circuit court’s decision that the 
dismissal of the 2011 action was an adjudication on the merits, 
agreeing that RCCH Rule 12(q) controlled . The ICA relied on its 
decision in Ryan v. Palmer , 130 Hawai‘i 321, 310 P.3d 1022 (App. 
2013). There, the circuit court dismissed the case pursuant to 
former RCCH Rule 12(q) based on plaintiff’s failure to file a 
pretrial statement, and the plaintiff appealed. Id. at 322, 310 
P.3d at 1023. The ICA noted that the dismissal was an 
adjudication on the merits pursuant to HRCP Rule 41(b)(3) and 
thus “with prejudice.” But in Ryan, the circuit court entered a 
final judgment. Here, there was no final judgment.8 
8 We also note that under Hawai‘i law, there would be no final 
judgment for claim preclusion purposes unless the time for filing appeals has 
(continued. . .) 
20  
 
    HRCP Rule 58 (2010) requires that “[t]he filing of [a 
final] judgment in the office of the clerk constitutes the entry 
of the judgment; and the judgment is not effective before such 
entry.”   In Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, we held 
that the court would enforce strict compliance with the 
requirements of HRCP Rule 58.  76 Hawai ‘i  115,  119- 20,  869 P.2d 
1334, 1338-39  (1994).  “[A]n order that purports  to be a final 
order as to all claims and parties in civil cases may be taken 
only after the order has been reduced to a judgment in favor of 
or against the parties. ”   Id.  at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338.   Without 
a final judgment, therefore, the ICA and circuit court both 
erred to the extent they  suggested that the dismissal of the 
2011 action was “on the merits”  for the purpose of claim 
preclusion.   Because  there was no separate final judgment  filed, 
this matter was not  finally adjudicated  on the merits.  Cf.  
Dorrance,  90 Hawai ‘i  at  150, 976 P.2d at 911  (holding that, for 
purposes of collateral estoppel,  final judgment was “on the 
merits” where the party “had the opportunity to fully defend 
herself”).   We therefore conclude  that the dismissal of the 2011 
 
  
    
 
     
   
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(continued . . .) 
passed or appeals have been exhausted. See Esteban, 129 Hawai‘i at 160, 296 
P.3d at 1068 (“[U]nder Hawai‘i law, there was a final judgment on the merits 
when the time to appeal the . . . [j]udgment expired.” (citing James W. 
Glover, Ltd. v. Fong , 42 Haw. 560 , 574 (1958)); contra Restatement (Second) 
of Judgments § 13 cmt. f (Am. L. Inst. 1982) . 
21  
 
    
 
 
    
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
ejectment action for want of prosecution was not an adjudication 
on the merits for the purposes of claim preclusion.  We 
nevertheless affirm the circuit court’s judgment because, despite its implication that claim preclusion would have applied 
if the claims had been the same, this court “may affirm a grant 
of summary judgment on any ground  appearing  in the record, even 
if the circuit court did not rely on it .”   Reyes, 76 
Hawai‘i  at 
140, 870 P.2d at 1284.  
We note, however, that had the circuit court issued a 
final judgment in the 2011 ejectment against U.S. Bank, HRCP 
41(b)(3) would require us to construe the dismissal as an 
adjudication on the merits. Neither party has argued that 
41(b)(3) would not apply , but U.S. Bank argues that involuntary 
dismissal with prejudice is appropriate only in “extreme 
circumstances” and that the Erum factors should have been 
considered. See Erum v. Llego , 147 Hawai‘i 368, 390, 465 P.3d 
815, 837 (2020) (“[W]henever a case is involuntarily di smissed 
with prejudice, the trial court must state essential findings on 
the record or make written findings as to deliberate delay or 
contumacious conduct and actual prejudice and explain why a 
lesser sanction than dismissal with prejudice is insufficient to 
serve the interests of justice.” ). However, the Erum situation 
is distinguishable. There, we were addressing the principles 
22  
 
  
   
 
   
  
  
  
  
 
  
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
that should inform a court’s discretionary decision to dismiss a 
case as a sanction for “deliberate delay or contumacious conduct 
causing actual prejudice that cannot be addressed through lesser 
sanctions.” Id. at 390 n.40 , 465 P.3d at 837. Here, there is a 
rule which requires dismissal as a matter of course. 
HRCP Rule 41(b)(3), unfortunately, puts trial courts 
in a bind, forcing dismissals to be construed as adjudications 
on the merits. This outcome may not be just in all 
circumstances . Had the trial court issued a final judgment 
here, it would have effectively allowed the Saplans to stay in 
the house indefinitely despite having defaulted on the mortgage. 
And it is not hard to imagine other cases in which plaintiffs , 
perhaps through no fault of their own, have their cases 
dismissed for want of prosecution — which would be construed as 
adjudications on the merits under HRCP Rule 41(b)(3) . We 
therefore recommend that the Committee on Rules of Civil 
Procedure and Circuit Court Civil Rules review R ule 41(b)(3) in 
light of these concerns . There are many potential sanctions for 
failing to prosecute a case that are less severe than dismissing 
it and construing it to have been adjudicated on the merits , but 
that nevertheless promote the purposes of the rule , such as 
dismissal without prejudice. 
23  
 
   
  To summarize, the ICA was incorrect  in concluding that 
the burden of proof was on U.S. Bank.  The burden is on the 
Saplans.  And, both the ICA and the circuit court incorrectly 
determined that the 2011 ejectment action was adjudicated on the 
merits for the purposes of claim preclusion.   A final judgment 
was required.  
  We  therefore  vacate the ICA’s June 6, 2023 Judgment on 
Appeal, and affirm the circuit court’s October 23, 2017 
Judgment.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
