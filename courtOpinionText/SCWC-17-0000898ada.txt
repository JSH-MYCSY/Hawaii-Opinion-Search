2 Appeals (ICA) affirming the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit’s1 
(circuit court) denial of Keanaaina’s motion to suppress 
evidence.  On certiorari, Keanaaina contends that the evidence 
against him – specifically, the contents of a gray backpack – 
should be excluded because (1)  Hawaiʻi Police Department  officers  
failed to comply with Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) §  803-37’s 
requirement that officers “demand entr ance” before entering a 
building  and (2) the resulting search of Keanaaina’s backpack 
exceeded the terms of the search warrant  the officers executed . 
Keanaaina i s incorrect.  First, the statutory 
obligation to “demand entrance” only applies when the building ’s 
entrance is “shut.”  It cannot feasibly be said that the 
entrance s to the tent structure  – which had multiple openings 
between the materials forming its wal ls – were shut.  Thus, the 
officers did not need to demand entrance , nor did the officers’ 
actions constitute a breaking.   Moreover , the purpose s of 
HRS § 803-37 were satisfied when the officers’ entry did not 
create any risk of harm.  Second, there was no  indication that 
the backpack belonged to Keanaaina .  The searches of the 
backpack consequently did not exceed the terms of the search 
warrant.  We therefore affirm the ICA’s June 5, 2020 Judgment on 
Appeal.

3 I. BACKGROUND  
A. Factual Background  
On the morning of March 8, 2017, police officers 
executed a search warrant for  Michelle Wright’s (Wright) tent 
structure located in a tent encampment within the Old Kona 
Airport Park.  The warrant authorized the search of  
The residence of Michelle WRIGHT described as a home less 
campsite consisting of various color and size tarpaulins at 
the Old Kona Airport beach park, located at the north end 
of Kuakini Highway, behind the Hawaiʻi State Parks and 
Recreation maintenance building.  Said campsite is situated 
on land belonging to the County of Hawaiʻi (Old Kona 
Airport) and Queen Liliuokalani Trust (corner of Kuakini 
Hwy and Makala Blvd); to include but not limited to all 
rooms, boxes, toolboxes, suitcases, handbags, safes, 
backpacks, fanny packs, bags, storage containers, walle ts, 
purses, papers, utility receipts and clothing located 
within said camp and/or stored outside -near the camp, 
wherever located within the County and State of Hawaiʻi 
. . . [.] 
The affidavit in support of the search warrant included two 
photographs depict ing Wright’s campsite.  In executing the 
search warrant, the officers knew that it was possible that they 
would find Keanaaina in Wright’s tent structure.   
When the officers entered the tent encampment  at least 
fifteen feet away from Wright’s tent structu re, they announced 
their presence and asked encampment residents to exit their 
tents.2  At the time of the search, it appears that the 
encampment consisted of approximately seven separate campsites.  
It appears from the record that one campsite was covered  by a 
                     
2  The officers asked encampment residents to exit their tents to ensure 
the officers’ safety, not to search the other  tents. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
4 single orange tarpaulin , one campsite consisted of a tent with 
an additional gray tarpaulin covering, one campsite consisted of 
a blue tarpaulin wall and silver roof, one campsite was covered 
by a dark material and a blue umbrella , one campsite consisted 
of a single tent , and one campsite was covered by a single blue 
tarpaulin .  The seventh campsite belonged to Wright.  
Given the composition of Wright’s tent structure, 
there was no obvious entrance or exit.  However, the tent 
structure was “open” such that a person could enter and exit 
without moving any of the materials  that formed its walls, the 
officers could look into the tent from the outside , and the 
officers could search inside of the tent without using 
flashlights.  
Looking thr ough a large opening in the tent structure, 
Detective Michael Hardie (Detective Hardie) saw Wright and 
Keanaaina sleeping on a mattress inside.  Detective Hardie 
repeated the officers’ announcements that police were present 
and asked Wright and Keanaaina t o exit the tent structure.  
After at least two minutes, Wright woke up and exited the tent 
structure through a small opening on the north end of the 
structure.  Keanaaina continued sleeping.  Detective Hardie 
attempted to wake Keanaaina by shouting into th e tent structure 
for a few more minutes, but was unsuccessful.  Wright *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
5 subsequently informed the officers that Keanaaina was hard of 
hearing.  
Based on Wright’s statement, Detective Hardie  entered 
the tent structure by “mov[ing] aside” a piece of fabric und er 
the opening through which he observed Wright and Keanaaina .  
Detective Hardie also moved a couch so that he could walk in a 
straight li ne to the bed where Keanaaina was sleeping.  However, 
Detective Hardie could have walked around the couch to enter the  
tent structure.3  Detective Hardie  woke Keanaaina and instructed 
him to exit the tent.  Before exiting the tent, Keanaaina 
allegedly asked Detective Hardie  “where’s my backpack[?]”   
Once Wright and Keanaaina were outside of the tent 
structure, t he office rs searched the tent structure and found, 
inter alia , a leopard-print backpack and a gray  backpack.  
                     
3  Keanaaina testified that: 
 
[State’s Counsel]: Okay.  In the area of that pink, the 
pink sheet in the front on the makai side of the tent –– 
 
[Keanaaina]: Yes.  
 
[State’s Counsel]: –– wasn’t there a couch there on the 
inside?  
 
[Keanaaina]: Under the opening , yeah. 
 
[State’s Counsel]: Okay.  There’s a couch; right?  
 
[Keanaaina]: No, not in the way  but it’s on the side.  You 
can walk around .  Michelle used that pink for block the 
doorway so you cannot see in.  
(Emphasis added.)  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
6  During an initial search  inside of the tent structure , the 
officers found a bag of marijuana  within the gray back pack.  The 
officers took the gray backpack  to the police station for a more 
thorough search.  During the second search, the police found 
Keanaaina’s identification , methamphetamine  residue, and drug 
paraphernalia  in the gray backpack.  
The State subsequently charged Keanaaina by complaint 
with one count of promoting a dangerous drug in the first 
degree, in violation of HRS §  712-1241(1)(a)4; two counts of 
prohibited acts related to drug paraphernalia, in violation of 
HRS § 329-43.5(a)5; three counts of promoting a dangerous drug in 
the third degree,  in violation of HRS §  712-1243(1)6; one count 
                     
4  HRS § 712-1241(1)(a)  (Supp. 20 16) provides  in relevant part: “[a] 
person commits the offense of promoting a dangerous drug in the first degree 
if the person knowingly: (a)  [p]ossesses one or more preparations, compounds, 
mixtures, or substances of an aggregate weight of: (i)  [o]ne ounc e or more, 
containing methamphetamine .  . . .” 
 
 A “dangerous drug” is “any substance or immediate precursor defined or 
specified as a ‘Schedule I substance’ or a ‘Schedule II substance’ by chapter 
329, or a substance specified in section 329 -18(c)(14), ex cept marijuana or 
marijuana concentrate. ”  HRS § 712-1240 (2014).  Methamphetamine is a 
Schedule II substance.  HRS §  329-16(e)(2)  (2010). 
 
5  HRS § 329-43.5(a) (Supp. 201 6) provides  in relevant part:  
 
it is unlawful for any person to use, or to possess with 
intent to use, drug paraphernalia to plant, propagate, 
cultivate, grow, harvest, manufacture, compound, convert, 
produce, process, prepare, test, analyze, pack, repack, 
store, contain, conceal, inject, ingest, inhale, or 
otherwise introduce into the h uman body a controlled 
substance in violation of this chapter.  
6  HRS § 712-1243(1) (2014) provides : “[a] person commits the offense of 
promoting a dangerous drug in the third degree if the person knowingly 
possesses any dangerous drug in any amount.”  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
7  of promoting a detrimental drug in the second degree, in 
violation of HRS §  712-1248(1)7; and one count of attempted 
promoting a controlled substance in, on , or near schools, school 
vehicles, public parks, or public housing projects or complexes, 
in violation of HRS §§  705-500(1)(b),8 712-1249.6(1).9 
B. Pre-Trial Proceedings  
Keanaaina sought to suppress his identification  and 
the evidence obtained from the gray backpack on the basis that 
the officers’ entry into the tent structure and subsequent 
                     
 
7  HRS § 712-1248(1) (2014) provides  in relevant part : “[a] person commits 
the offense of promoting a detrimental drug in the second degree if the 
person knowingly .  . . [p]ossesses one or more preparations, compounds, 
mixtures, or substances, of an aggregate  weight of one ounce or more, 
containing any marijuana .” 
 
8  HRS § 705-500(1)(b)  (2014) provides : “[a] person is guilty of an 
attempt to commit a crime if the person .  . . [i]ntentionally  engages in 
conduct which, under the circumstances as the person believes them to be, 
constitutes a substantial step in a course of conduct intended to culminate 
in the person’s commission of the crime.”  
 
9  HRS § 712-1249.6(1)  (2014) provides  in relevant part:  
 
Promoting a controlled substance in, on, or near 
schools, school vehicles, public parks, or public housing 
projects or complexes.   (1) A person commits the offense of 
promoting a controlled substance in, on, or near schools, 
school vehicles, public  parks, or public housing projects 
or complexes if the person knowingly:  
 
(a)  Distributes or possesses with intent to distribute a 
controlled substance in any amount in or on the real 
property comprising a school, public park, or public 
housing project o r complex;  
 
(b)  Distributes or possesses with intent to distribute a 
controlled substance in any amount within seven hundred 
and fifty feet of the real property comprising a 
school, public park, or public housing project or 
complex[.]  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
8 search of the backpack violated  HRS § 803-3710 because the 
officers  needed to demand ent rance to the tent structure before 
they could search his bag.  
Keanaaina additionally argued that the search of his 
bag exceeded the scope of the warrant, which authorized the 
search of  
The residence of Michelle WRIGHT described as a homeless 
campsite consisting of various color and size tarpaulins at 
the Old Kona Air port beach park, located at the north end 
of Kuakini Highway, behind the Hawaiʻi State Parks and 
Recreation maintenance building.  Said campsite is situated 
on land belonging to the Count y of Hawaiʻi (Old Kona 
Airport) and Queen Liliuokalani Trust (corner of Kuakini 
Hwy and Makala Blvd); to include but not limited to all 
rooms, boxes, toolboxes, suitcases, handbags, safes, 
backpacks, fanny packs, bags, storage containers, wallets, 
purses, papers, utility receipts and clothing located 
within said camp and/or  stored outside -near the camp, 
wherever located within the County and State of Hawaiʻi 
. . . . 
Specifically, Keanaaina claimed that since the warrant was 
targeted at Wright, it did not “support a .  . . search of his 
belongings.”  Keanaaina also asserted th at the search warrant 
                     
10  HRS § 803-37 (2014) provides : 
 
Power of officer serving.   The officer charged with the 
warrant, if a house, store, or other building is designated 
as the place to be searched, may enter it without demanding 
permission if the officer finds it open.  If the doors are 
shut the officer must declare the officer’s office and the 
officer’s business, and demand entrance.  If the doors, 
gates, or other bars to the entrance are not immediately 
opened, the officer may break them.  When entered, the 
officer may demand that any other pa rt of the house, or any 
closet, or other closed place in which the officer has 
reason to believe the property is concealed, may be opened 
for the officer’s inspection, and if refused the officer 
may break them.  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
9 did not comply with constitutional prohibitions “that no 
warrants shall issue absent ‘  . . . particularity describing 
. . . . [sic] things to be seized.’”11 
Following a hearing, t he circuit court denied 
Keanaaina’s motion.  As relevant  here, the circuit court found 
that Detective Hardie “called into the structure numerous times, 
announcing police presence and search warrants.”  
The circuit court additionally found that “neither 
[Detective] Hardie nor any of the other officers were aware that 
a backpack inside the tent belonged to [Keanaaina] prior to the 
tent being search[ed] or whether any particular backpack 
belonged to [Keanaaina].”  When the officers first searched the 
gray backpack, “contraband was found within the backpack, 
includin g marijuana and small zip bags.”  “When the [gray] 
backpack was searched at the Kealakehe Police Station, 
identification cards for Samson Keanaaina were observed within 
it and photographed.”  
The circuit court therefore reached three relevant 
conclusions  of law.  First, “[w]hen the officers observed the 
                     
11  Keanaaina superficially identified this “P articularity of Warrant” 
claim on appeal, but did not present any argument to the ICA pertaining to 
the breadth of the search warrant.  
 On certiorari, Keanaaina does not claim, much less argue, that the 
search warrant constituted an unlawful general warran t.  Keanaaina therefore 
expressly abandoned his general warrant claim, and we do not address this 
basis for K eanaaina’s motion to suppress any further.  Hawaiʻi Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4).  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
10 items of identification .  . . , the items of identification were 
in plain view, as the initial intrusion was justified by the 
valid search warrant. ” 
Second, “[t]he officers did not need to comply with 
the requirements of [HRS §  803-37] because there was no 
‘breaking’ of any door to gain entrance to the structure.”  This 
was because  “[w]hen Ms. Wright exited the Wright Residence, her 
‘door’ was voluntarily opened, and there is no need for officers 
to knock and announce.”  Nevertheless, the circuit court 
determined that  
the officers did comply by loudly announcing police 
presence, the police business (search warrants), and 
instructions to exit the tents.  Having waited outside the 
structure for several minutes a fter the announcements 
before Ms. Wright exited the Wright Residence, then taking 
additional minutes to call into the tent to rouse the 
defendant, the officers waited a reasonable time to enter 
the structure.  
The circuit court therefore concluded that the officers ’ actions 
“respected the purposes of the knock and announce rule and did 
not offend constitutional protections.”  
Third, the search warrant authorized the officers “to 
search ‘plausible repositories’ found within the Wright 
Residence .  . . .“  Here,  “[t]he backpack which contained 
[Keanaaina’s] identification cards .  . . was not clearly the 
property of [Wright or Keanaaina] .  . . , so the search of the 
backpack was not improper.”  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
11 C. Trial Proceedings  
On September 12, 2017, the case proceeded to a jury 
trial.  The jury convicted Keanaaina for one count of prohibited 
acts related to drug paraphernalia; one count of promoting a 
dangerous drug in the third degree; one count of promoting a 
detrimental drug in the third degree; and one count of attempted 
promoting a controlled substance in, on, or near schools, school 
vehicles, public parks, or public housing projects or complexes.  
The circuit court entered its Judgment of Conviction 
and Sentence on November 17, 2017.  
D. ICA Memorandum Opinion  
Keanaaina appealed t he circuit court’s Judgment of 
Conviction and Sentence to the ICA, arguing, inter alia , that 
the circuit court should have granted Keanaaina’s motion to 
suppress.12  The ICA affirmed the circuit court  decision . 
First, the ICA concluded  that the officers “complied 
with the requirements and purposes of HRS §  803-37 and the 
Circuit Court did not err when it denied Keanaaina’s Motion to 
Suppress .”  Citing State v. Dixon , 83 Hawaiʻi 13, 14, 924 P.2d 
181, 182 (1996), the ICA noted that “[t]he purposes of this s o-
called knock and announce rule are to ‘(1)  reduce the potential 
                     
12  Keanaaina also asserted that the trial co urt should have dismissed a 
juror for potential bias and that he received ineffective assistance of 
counsel.  Keanaaina repeats these claims in his application for writ of 
certiorari.  These arguments lack merit for the reasons discussed in the 
ICA’s memor andum opinion.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
12 of violence to both occupants and police resulting from an 
unannounced entry; (2)  prevent unnecessary property damage; and 
(3) protect the occupant’s right to privacy.’”  The ICA 
explained t hat the statute did not require the officers to 
“knock” on the tent, but merely to announce their presence, 
which the officers did repeatedly .  The ICA added that there was 
little risk of property damage or injury when the officers could 
see into the tent structure  and waited a reasonable time before 
entering to wake Keanaaina.  The ICA  acknowledged  that the 
waiting period  also “protected Keanaaina’s privacy as much as 
possible.”  
Second, the ICA held that the officers were authorized 
to search the gray back pack.  The ICA reasoned that, under this 
court’s precedent in State v. Nabarro , 55 Haw. 583, 587 -88, 525 
P.2d 573, 576 -77 (1974), a valid search warrant authorizes 
officers to inspect bags in the specified search area so long as 
the officers did not have “ notice of some sort of the ownership 
of a belonging[.]”  The ICA pointed out that “[t]here is no 
evidence in the record that the police knew that the gray 
backpack belonged to Keanaaina prior to searching it.”  The ICA 
further noted that the officers did n ot identify the gray 
backpack as Keanaaina’s until the police station search, at 
which point the bag ’s contents were admissible under the plain *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
13 view doctrine because they were “observed after warrant -
authorized opening of the backpack[.]”  
II. STANDARD OF REVIE W 
A. Motion to Suppress  
“[W]e review questions of constitutional law under the 
‘right/wrong’ standard.”  State v. Jenkins , 93 Hawaiʻi 87, 100, 
997 P.2d 13, 26 (2000) (citing State v. Toyomura , 80 Hawaiʻi 8, 
15, 904 P.2d 893, 900 (1995)).  Accordingly, “[w]e review the 
circuit court’s ruling on a motion to suppress de novo to 
determine whether the ruling was ‘right’ or ‘wrong.’”  State v. 
Kauhi, 86 Hawaiʻi 195, 197, 948 P.2d 1036, 1038 (1997) (citing 
State v. Navas , 81 Hawaiʻi 113, 123, 913 P.2d 39, 49 (1996)).  
III.  DISCUSSION  
A. The officers complied with the requirements of HRS §  803-
37. 
The text of HRS §  803-37 provides in relevant part:  
The officer charged with the warrant, if a house, 
store, or other building is designated as the place to be 
searched, may enter it without demanding permission if the 
officer finds it open.  If the doors are shut the officer 
must declare the officer’s office and the officer’s 
business, and demand entrance.  If the doors, gates, o r 
other bars to the entrance are not immediately opened, the 
officer may break them.  
The statute thus creates a two-stage inquiry for determining 
whether and how an officer may enter a building to execute a  
search warrant.  We first ask  whether the structu re is “open.”   
If so, an officer may enter  without taking any further action , 
and that is the end of the inquiry .  If not, we then ask if the *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
14 officer “demand[ed] entrance .”  If so, the officer may “break” 
any bars to entrance if they are not immediately op ened and 
enter.  If not, the officer should not enter the building or 
break its bars to entrance.  
Applying this order of inquiry to the present case, 
the circuit court correctly determined that HRS §  803-37 did not 
require the officers to demand entrance b ecause (1)  Wright’s 
tent structure was open and (2)  Detective Hardie’s actions 
consequently did not constitute a breaking.   Additionally, 
although HRS §  803-37 did not require the officers to demand 
entrance, we note  that they effectively carried out the 
statute’s policy goals.  
1. The officers did not need to demand entrance into the 
open tent structure . 
According to Keanaaina, HRS §  803-37 obligated the 
officers to demand entrance to Wright’s tent structure because 
Detective Hardie used force to lift a sheet and move a couch 
before entering.  
This contention  improperly reverses HRS §  803-37’s 
order of inquiry by assuming that the existence of any bars to 
entrance into a building renders the building shut for purposes 
of HRS §  803-37.  Common sense proves otherw ise.  For example, a 
building may have a double door entry .  If one of the two doors 
is shut, it would form a bar to entrance.  However, so long as *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
15  the other door  is open, the building  is also open for purposes 
of HRS §  803-37. 
That is precisely the case here.  The record shows 
that there were numerous openings into Wright’s tent structure.13  
Notably, Wright used one of these openings to exit the tent 
structure.14  The tent structure was consequently open insofar as 
there was an entrance that the officers c ould have used to enter 
the structure without lifting or moving any of the tarpaulins or 
materials that formed its walls.   Under these circumstances, 
HRS § 803-37’s mandate that an officer “demand entrance” when 
“the doors are shut” is inapplicable.  See HRS § 803-37. 
2. Detective Hardie’s actions could not constitute a 
breaking  that required the officers to demand 
entrance . 
Citing State v. Harada , 98 Hawaiʻi 18, 41 P.3d 174 
(2002), Keanaaina further argues that Detective Hardie’s uses of 
force to lift a sheet  of fabric and move a couch constituted 
breakings that triggered HRS §  803-37’s requirement that the 
officers demand entr ance.  However, this argument incorrectly 
assumes that any use of force causes a breaking  for which the 
                     
13  For the purposes of this proceeding, this court assumes without 
deciding that Wright’s tent structure constituted “a house . . . or other  
building ” under the terms of HRS §  803-37. 
 
14  Keanaaina argues in passing that Wright “did not open the door for 
police entry.”  However, this court’s precedent makes clear that a building 
occupant’s reason for opening a door is irrelevant.  See Dixon, 83 Hawaiʻi at 
21, 924 P.2d at 189 (holding that o fficers need not demand entr ance when 
using a ruse to persuade an occupant to open a door).  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
16  officers had to demand entrance .  Rather, Harada makes clear 
that a breaking only occurs when  the force is “used to gain 
entry.”  98 Hawaiʻi at 24, 41 P.3d at 180.  
This distinction is particularly important where, as 
here, an officer’s  use of force to enter a building is merely 
incidental – and not necessary – to their entry.  For instance, 
in Harada, we held that officers had to demand entrance because 
“a breaking occurred when Officer Bermudes used force to prevent 
Harada from closing the door.”  98 Hawaiʻi at 30, 41 P. 3d at 186.  
Similarly, we explained in State v. Monay , 85 Hawaiʻi 282, 283, 
943 P.2d 908, 909 (1997),  that an officer opening a n apartment’s  
closed, unlocked front door  by using force to turn the door knob  
is required to demand entr ance.  In both of these situations, 
the officers were only able to gain entry to the building at 
issue because of  their use of force.  
The record shows that Detective Hardie’s use of force 
was incidental to his entry, and therefore did not constitute a 
breaking .  Notably, Detectiv e Hardie could have entered the tent 
structure using the same opening Wright used as an exit.15  
                     
15  The dissent contends that because Wright moved a tarp to the side to 
exit the tent, this opening was “shut”  to Detective Hardie.   This reasoning 
is flawed for two reasons.  First, as our double door example  illustrates, 
the mere fact that an obstruction may be present does not render a structure 
shut. 
 Second, by the dissent’s logic, if a person opens the entrance to a 
structure and leaves it open, the fact that the person opened the entrance 
door would obligate the officers to demand entry.  However, t his court has *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
17 Detective Hardie’s act of lifting a sheet of fabric consequently 
was not necessary to gain entry to the tent.  Additionally, 
Keanaaina’s own testimony indicated  that Detective Hardie could 
have walked around the couch.  Detective Hardie’s movement of 
the couch was , in turn,  unnecessary to  gain entry . 
In sum, HRS §  803-37’s requirement that officers 
demand entrance to a shut building was not triggered because 
(1) Wright’s tent structure was open and (2)  Detective Hardie’s 
uses of force  therefore  did not constitute “breakings” because 
the force was not necessary to gain entry.16 
3. The officers nevertheless satisfied the objectives of 
HRS § 803-37’s requirement to deman d entrance.  
Despite the fact that  HRS § 803-37 did not obligate  
the officers  to demand entrance, Keanaaina proclaims that the 
purposes of the rule “were in fact frustrated .”  This is 
incorrect.   The legislature enacted the  “knock and announce” 
rule to: “(1)  reduce the potential of violence to both occupants 
and police resulting from an unannounced entry; (2)  prevent 
                     
already determined that such is not the case.  See Dixon, 83 Hawaiʻi at 21, 
924 P.2d at 189 (holding that officers need not demand entrance after an 
occupant opened the entry door).  
 
16  Other courts have similarly held that an incidental use of force does 
not constitute a breaking.  See, e.g. , United States v. Thorne , 997 F.2d 
1504, 1513 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (holding that no br eaking occurred where “door 
was ajar” and officer “knocked twice and the force of the knocks further 
opened the door.”); State v. Campana , 678 N.E.2d 626, 629 (Ohio App. 1996) 
(“the officers knocked and then walked into the workshop through an unlocked 
door that was ajar .  In that they did not have to break down the door or 
break a window to effectuate the arrest, [the knock and announce statute] is 
inapplicable to this case.”) (emphasis added).  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
18 unnecessary property damage; and (3)  protect the occupant’s 
right of privacy.”  Dixon, 83 Hawaiʻi at 14, 924 P.2d at 182; see 
also State v. Eleneki , 92 Hawaiʻi 562, 565, 993 P.2d 1191, 1194 
(2000) (“Although the language of HRS §§  803-11 and 803 -37 
differs, the purposes of the ‘knock and announce rule’ are 
identical in each context .  . . .”).  The officers’ actio ns 
fulfilled each of these goals.  
First, the officers reduced the potential of violence 
to both occupants and police by loudly announcing their presence 
and demanding that Wright and Keanaaina exit the tent structure.  
Although Keanaaina contends that “an unannounced entry had the 
potential of violence ,” the record proves otherwise.  Detective 
Hardie look ed into the tent from a large opening.  From this 
vantage point, Detective Hardie saw that both Wright and 
Keanaaina were sleeping.  Detective Hardie attem pted to wake 
Wright and Keanaaina and to order both to exit the tent.  If 
anything, these instructions reduced the potential of violence 
since the tent was a small, confined area where the occupants 
would be in close proximity to the officers and could hav e 
access to concealed weapons.   Once Wright exited the tent 
structure, the only remaining occupant was Keanaaina, who 
continued sleeping.  Under these circumstances, Detective 
Hardie’s entrance into the tent  after ordering the occupants to *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
19 exit did not cre ate any potential of violence to either 
Detective Hardie or Keanaaina.  
Second, Detective Hardie’s entry into the tent did not 
create any risk of unnecessary property damage.  Keanaaina 
insists that “moving a couch or opening a closed flap/barrier 
causes da mages at least in the form of disrupting the living 
quarters.”  However, this argument disregards the knock and 
announce rule’s purpose of preventing unnecessary  property 
damage.  See Dixon, 83 Hawaiʻi at 14, 924 P.2d at 182.  
Regardless, given that there was no potential for violence from 
Detective Hardie’s entry, it was similarly unlikely that the 
entry would have led to any property damage.  
Third, Detective Hardie acted with all due respect for 
Keanaaina’s privacy.  The officers began their announcements  
when they entered the tent encampment , at least fifteen feet 
away from Wright’s tent structure .  This gave Wright and 
Keanaaina some time to wake up and collect themselves before the 
officers arrived at Wright’s tent structure.  Additionally, 
Keanaaina ha d, at best, a limited expectation of privacy inside 
of the tent.  See State v. Kaaheena , 59 Haw. 23, 28 -29, 575 P.2d 
462, 466-67 (1978) (explaining that there is no reasonable 
expectation of privacy when observations can be made from “a 
non-intrusive vanta ge point.”).  The record reveals that there 
was at least one large, pre -existing opening in the tent *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
20 structure that allowed passersby to look into the tent 
structure.  Thus, Detective Hardie’s observations through the 
opening did not intrude upon Keanaaina ’s privacy inside the tent 
structure.  Kaaheena , 59 Haw. at 28 -29, 575 P.2d at 4 66-67.   
Detective Hardie  also gave Keanaaina a reasonable 
period of time to respond before entering the tent.  “[W]hat 
would constitute a reasonable period of time to respond to a 
knock and announcement must be determined by the circumstances 
of each case.”  Monay, 85 Hawaiʻi at 284, 943 P.2d at 910 
(quoting State v. Garcia , 77 Hawaiʻi 461, 468, 887 P.2d 671, 678 
(App. 1995)).  Once Wright exited the tent, Detective Hardie 
continued trying to wake up Keanaaina from outside of the tent 
for a few minutes.   Given that Detective Hardie could see that 
Keanaaina was non -responsive and knew that Keanaaina was hard of 
hearing,  it appears that Detective Hardie waited a reasonable 
amount of time before entering the tent structure.  Monay, 85 
Hawaiʻi at 284, 943 P.2d at 910.  
The officers’ entry into Wright’s tent structure 
consequently satisfied HRS §  803-37’s purposes.  Dixon, 83 
Hawaiʻi at 15, 924 P.2d at 182; Eleneki, 92 Hawaiʻi at 565, 993 
P.2d at 1194.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
21 B. The search warrant authorized the  officers to search 
Keanaaina’s backpack.  
Keanaaina also claims that the ICA erred in ruling 
that the warrant authorized the officers to search Keanaaina’s 
backpack .  Keanaaina points out that the warr ant authorized the 
officers to search items “found to be under the control of a 
female party identified as Michelle WRIGHT.”  However, Keanaaina 
argues that Wright “could not have been in control of the 
backpack” because she was not in the tent next to the  backpack 
at the time it was seized by the officers.  Keanaaina further 
asserts that the officers had notice that the backpack was 
Keanaaina’s  – not Wright’s  – because it “was found next to 
[Keanaaina]  on a bed where he was sleeping and the police 
identifi ed the [leopard -print] backpack as belonging to Michelle 
Wright.”  These arguments are unavailing.  
First, Keanaaina’s insistence that Wright had to be in 
the tent to control the backpack – and thereby bring the 
backpack within the warrant’s ambit – is nonsensical.   By 
Keanaaina’s reasoning, Wright lost control over all objects in 
the tent  the moment  she walked out.  A defendant may not so 
easily evade a lawful search  of their possessions .  Black’s Law 
Dictionary  416 (11th ed. 2019)  defines “control” as “[t]he 
direct or indirect  power to govern the management ” of an object.  
(Emphasis added.)  It also defines the act of control as “[t]o *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
22 exercise power or influence over.”  Id.  These definitions 
indicate  that a person may “control” an  object without actual 
physical possession of  or proximity to  the item.    
Our precedent regarding possession  confirms this .  For 
instance, a person may exercise actual possession, meaning that 
she “has direct physical control over a thing at a given time.”   
State v. Jenkins , 93 Hawaiʻi 87, 110, 997 P.2d 13, 36 (2000).  
Alternatively, this person may exercise constructive possession, 
where she possesses “both the power and the intention at a given 
time to exercise dominion over [the] thing, either directly o r 
through another person or persons.”  Id.  Thus, Wright could 
still have possessed and controlled the gray backpack  without 
actually being inside of the tent, and the officers were 
therefore not precluded from searching the gray backpack . 
Second, the offi cers lacked sufficient notice to 
determine that Keanaaina owned the backpack.  Keanaaina claims 
that the facts that his “gray camo backpack was found next to 
him . . . and [that] the police identified the [leopard -print] 
backpack as belonging to Michelle W right” w ere sufficient to 
notify the officers that Keanaaina had “some sort of ownership 
of the backpack.”  This court’s decision in Nabarro leads us to 
a different conclusion .  See 55 Haw. 583, 525 P.2d 573.  
There, officers conducted a search of a hotel room 
pursuant to a warrant identifying two male occupants.  Id. at *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
23 583-84, 525 P.2d at 574.  During the search, Nabarro, who was a 
female visitor in the room, grabbed her purse before attempting 
to enter the ba throom.  Id.  The officers searched Nabarro’s 
purse and found marijuana and paraphernalia.  Id. at 584, 525 
P.2d at 574 -75.  This court held that the evidence found in 
Nabarro’s purse should have been suppressed because “there was 
no question that the poli ce had notice, prior to the search, 
that Miss Nabarro .  . . was the owner of the purse.”  Id. at 
588, 585 P.2d at 577.  This conclusion was based upon the facts 
that (1)  the warrant identified two males as the occupants of 
the room, making it unlikely that  the purse belonged to either 
of the warrant’s targets; (2)  the purse was in Miss Nabarro’s 
immediate vicinity; and (3)  Miss Nabarro picked up the purse “in 
circumstances that made it highly unlikely that the purse 
belonged to anyone else.”  Id. 
None of th ese factors are present here.  First, it is 
unreasonable for Keanaaina to imply that Wright could only 
possess one backpack.  It is plausible that, as a person without 
permanent housing, Wright owned multiple backpacks to keep her 
possessions easily mobile .  Indeed, the warrant recognized as 
much when it authorized the search of “backpacks.”  Furthermore,  
the backpack’s gray coloration d id not provide notice that the 
bag did not belong to Wright.  Nothing pre vents a woman from *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
24 owning both a leopard-print backpack and a dark -colored 
backpack.  
Second, the fact that the bag was in close proximity 
to Keanaaina also d id not provide notice that the ba ckpack 
belonged to Keanaaina.   As a preliminary matter, we clarify that 
Nabarro’s  identification that the purse was  in Nabarro’s 
immediate vicinity must be considered in the context that purses 
are “characteristically female attire.”17  See id. at 588, 525 
P.2d at 577.   No similar context  clues existed here.  Nothing 
about the backpack’s color indicated that it belonged  to 
Keanaaina.  Furthermore , the officers only knew that Keanaaina 
might be  in Wright’s tent.  The officers therefore could have 
fairly assumed that the items in the tent belonged to Wright 
regardless of their proximity to Keanaaina.  
Lastly, Keanaaina did not take any action that 
indicated that the gray backpack was his.   Keanaaina did not 
testify that he described his bag to the officers.  At most, he 
                     
17  There would be significant issues in relying on  proximity alone as a 
dispositive factor.   As this court explained in Nabarro, placing a visitor ’s 
possible possessions beyond the reach of a search warrant would render 
effective execution impossible “since the police could never be sure that a 
plausible repository for items named in the warrant belongs to a resident, 
and hence is searchable, or to a non -resident, and hence is not searchable.”  
Id. at 587-88, 525 P.2d at 5 76-77. 
Keanaaina’s proposed use of proximity as a dispositive factor would 
lead to an  even more untenable circumstance than the one this court sought to 
avoid in Nabarro.  Instead of merely preventing police from searching items 
that clearly belong to a visitor, Keanaaina suggests that police should not 
be able to search items that are near a known visitor.  This would have 
rendered the execution of the search warrant impossible by preventing the 
officers from searching  any items or places near Keanaaina.  Contra id. at 
587-88, 525 P.2d at 5 76-77. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

asked Detective  Hardie “where’s my backpack ?”  Although this 
inquiry would have indicated  that Keanaaina  may have owned a 
backpack in the tent, it was not sufficient to inform the 
officers that Keanaaina owned the gray backpack.  
Under these circumstances, the officers did not have 
notice that Keanaaina was the owner of the backpack, and were 
therefore entitled  to assume that the backpack was subject to 
search under the warrant.  See id. at 588, 525 P.2d at 577  
(“without notice of some sort of ownership of a belonging, the 
police are entitled to assume that all objects within premises 
lawfully subject to search under a warrant are part of those 
premises for the purpose of executing the warrant.”).  
IV. CONCLUSION  
For the foregoing reasons , we affirm the ICA’s June 5, 
2020 Judgment on Appeal, which affirmed the circuit court’s  
November 17, 2017 Judgment of Conviction and Sentence .
