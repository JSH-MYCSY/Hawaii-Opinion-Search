RECKTENWALD,  C.J.,  NAKAYAMA,  McKENNA,  POLLACK,  AND  WILSON,  JJ. 
AMENDED  OPINION  OF  THE  COURT  BY  RECKTENWALD,  C.J. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
This case requires
 us to address the proper 
consideration and weight of a hānai1 relationship in the context 
of a child welfare proceeding. We conclude that a hānai relative 
1 “Meaning  ‘to  feed’  or  ‘to  nourish,’  hānai  re fers  to  a  child  who  is 
reared,  educated,  and  loved  by  someone  other  than  the  child’s  natural 
parents.”   Native  Hawaiian  Law:  A  Treatise  1140  (Melody  Kapilialoha  MacKenzie 
with  Susan  K.  Serrano,  D.  Kapua ala  Sproat,  eds.,  2015)  (citation  omitted).           
       
      *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
who  is  a  child’s  resource  caregiver  has  an  interest  in  that 
child’s  custody  sufficient  to  allow  intervention  in  such 
proceedings  under  Rule  24(a)(2)  of  the  Hawai i  Family  Court  Rules 
(HFCR).
   In  addition,  we  conclude  that,  when  conducting  a  best 
interest  of  the  child  analysis,  family  courts  must  consider   that 
child’s  hānai  relationships. 
The  case  involves  a  7-year-old  child,  AB,  who  is  now 
12.   After  a  short  time  in  foster  care,  AB  reunified  with  her 
father  and  lived  in  a  home  with  him,  his  longtime  girlfriend,  KL, 
and  their  child,  AB’s  younger  half-sister.   AB’s  father  moved  out 
a  few  months  later,  but  AB,  as  keiki  hānai2  of  KL,  remained  in 
the  same  home  with  her.   AB  lived  there  for  over  a  year  until  the 
family  court  changed  her  placement  to  her  maternal  great-aunt  and 
-uncle’s  home  in  New  Hampshire.   
At  the  hearing  changing  AB’s  placement,  KL 
unsuccessfully  urged  the  family  court  to  recognize  her  interest 
in  the  proceeding.   KL  appealed,   and  the  ICA  vacated  the  family 
court’s  order  denying  intervention,  holding  that  because  KL  had 
filed  a  petition  to  adopt  AB,  she  had  a  sufficient  interest  in 
AB’s  custody  or  visitation  to  intervene  as  a  matter  of  right.   KL 
filed  an  application  for  certiorari  seeking  this  court’s  further 
review.   She  argues  that,  in  addition  to  her  pending  adoption 
petition,  her  status  as  a  hānai  relative  conferred  a  substantive 3 
2 As discussed further below, KL’s hānai  status is  undisputed.

            interest in AB’s placement. 
We accepted certiorari to clarify that the family court 
should have allowed KL to intervene during AB’s placement hearing 
based in part on her status as AB’s hānai parent. The family  
court committed an additional error when it failed to examine 
AB’s best interests prior to changing her placement to New 
Hampshire. And, as part of the best interests analysis, the 
family court should have considered AB’s hānai relationships. 
II. BACKGROUND 
AB  was
  born  to  her  mother,   SH  (“Mother”),  and  her 
father,  JB  (“Father”).   Mother  and  Father  were  never  married.   AB 
has  two  younger  maternal  half-siblings,  PD  and  Baby,  from 
Mother’s   other  relationships.    Mother  is  originally   from  New 
Hampshire   and  has  a  large  extended  family  there,  including   her 
aunt,  SH.   Father  is  from  4
Hawai i  and  has  Native   Hawaiian 
ancestry.    Father  began  a  relationship   with  the  petitioner,   KL,
 
who  also  has  Native  Hawaiian  ancestry,  when  AB  was  around  three 
years  old.   The  parties  agree  that  KL  is  AB’s  hānai  relative.5 
4 Baby was placed in a separate resource home, and was adopted by 
his foster family. 
5 Because KL’s hānai status is  undisputed, we need not determine 
exactly what relationships will be recognized as hānai in the context of child 
welfare proceedings. As noted further below, Hawai i statutes, a dministrative 
rules, and historical materials on Native Hawaiian law define the term “hānai” 
sl
ightly differently. We do not here decide between these definitions, nor do 
we limit the applicability of the rule announced herein to relationships 
factually identical to the relationship between KL and AB.

  A. Family Court Proceedings 
   1. Initiation of Foster Custody 
  
         
        
          
         
        
          
     
        
           
           
           
          
             
         
            
 
        On  January  29,  2015,  shortly  after  Mother  gave  birth  to 
Baby,  the  Department  of  Human  Services  (“DHS”  or  “Department”) 
initiated  protective  proceedings  with  respect  to  Mother’s  three 
children,  including  AB,  by  filing  a  Petition  for  Temporary  Foster 
Custody.   The  family  court  granted  temporary  foster  custody.   
2. Reunification
 with Father 
AB was unable to live with Father when the Department 
initiated protective proceedings because Father was living at his 
parents’ home, and his father was a registered sex offender. 
However, Father began actively looking for housing, and AB and 
Father had regularly scheduled supervised visits. In accordance 
with a family service plan, Father engaged in services with the 
hopes of reunifying with AB. 
According to a March 3, 2015 Ohana Conference Report,  
Father and AB had “a strong support in [Father]’s partner, [KL].” 
Father and KL had been in a relationship for several years, and 
they had a child together, TL (AB’s paternal half-sister). In a 
June 5, 2015 Safe Family Home Report, the Department stated that 
AB “asked Father if she can live with him, and she also asked her 
[paternal] half-sister’s mother, [KL], if she can live with her 
as well.” Father and KL began renting a home together in late 
2015. 
On January 26,
 2016, the family court approved the

       Department’s permanency plan to reunify AB with Father, as Father 
was “continu[ing] to work on services that will assist [him] with 
reunification.” 
On March 2, 2016, KL underwent a psychological 
evaluation to determine her ability to parent AB. KL indicated 
that she had been involved in AB’s life for approximately five 
years, and that during her periods of separation with Father, KL 
kept in touch with AB and Mother so that AB and TL could have 
contact. The Safe Family Home Report dated May 23, 2016 stated, 
“The evaluation did not find any deficits in [KL’s] ability to 
take care of [AB][.]” 
On March 18, 2016, AB was reunified with Father, TL, 
and KL under an award of Family Supervision, as the Department 
found, and the court agreed, that Father was able “to provide a 
minimally safe family home for [AB] at this time with the 
assistance of a court-ordered service plan.” 
3. SH’s First Motion to Intervene 
On February 19, 2016, AB’s maternal great-aunt, SH, 
filed a Motion to Intervene. SH argued that she was entitled to 
intervene pursuant to HFCR Rule 24.6 SH sought to intervene to 
6 HFCR Rule 24 states in relevant part: 
Upon timely application anyone shall be permitted to 
intervene in an action when the applicant claims an 
interest relating to the . . . custody, visitation, or 
parental rights of a minor child which is the subject 
of the action and the applicant is so situated that 
the disposition of the action may as a practical 
matter impair or impede the applicant’s ability to

      ensure  that  the  court  was  aware  of  “the  concerns  of  the  maternal 
extended  family”  and  “to  give  [the]  [c]ourt  and  the  Department 
another  placement  option[.]”   SH  claimed  that  she  was  “not 
seeking  custody”  and  “only  want[ed]  to  support  [PD’s  and  AB’s] 
fathers  and  be  a  second  option  if  necessary[.]”   SH  noted, 
however,  that  she  had  “submitted  the  necessary  paperwork  (which 
the  Department  is  mandated  to  consider)  necessary  to  be 
considered  a  placement  option,”  and  she  argued  that  she  “has  the 
legal  right  to  seek  custody,  should  that  become  necessary, 
pursuant  to  [HRS]  §  571-46(a)(2).”   DHS  opposed   SH’s  Motion  to 
Intervene.   The  court  denied  the  Motion  without   explaining   its 
reasoning.   8 7 
4. Reinstatement of Fost
er Custody 
On May 20, 2016, the Department submitted a report to 
(...continued) 
protect  that  interest,   unless  the  applicant[’]s 
interest  is  adequately  represented  by  existing 
parties. 
7 HRS § 571-46(a)(2) states that in any proceeding where the custody 
of a minor child is in dispute, “[c]ustody may be awarded to persons other 
than the father or mother whenever the award serves the best interest of the 
child.” 
8 On March 22, 2016, the Department filed a memorandum in opposition 
to SH’s motion to intervene, arguing that SH did not have a right or 
permission to intervene under HFCR Rule 24(a) or (b). The Department argued, 
“The movant has no right to custody, visitation, nor is she the parent of 
these children. . . . She has no legal interest. As a matter of fact Movant 
asserted in her moving papers that she does not want custody.” 
The Department also argued that SH improperly relied on HRS § 571-
46 to support her position. “Movant has asserted that she does not intend to 
interfere or obtain custody. More importantly this statute section does not 
apply as these children have never lived with the movant[;] she has never had 
de facto custody of the children .”

  the court in advance of the next hearing. The Department 
reported that Father and KL “are unsure at this point if they are 
going to stay together[.]” The Department noted, however, that 
both “have agreed to co-parent their daughter and [AB], whatever 
the outcome. [KL] has been very loving and involved with [AB], 
and the girl is bonded with her.” At the time, the Department 
recommended continuing family supervision. 
AB continued to live with KL. The Department reported 
that “[AB] is doing well, and bonded with [KL]. [KL] would like 
to become [AB’s] special licensed resource caregiver.”9 While 
the Department noted that “Father has had visits with [AB], and 
helps co-parent her,” it changed its recommendation from 
continued family supervision to foster custody, given Father’s 
new living arrangement - back at home with his father. 
After a hearing held on June 2, 2016, the family court 
placed AB in foster custody and formalized AB’s “placement with 
her hanai relative, [KL].” 
Over four months later, on October 17, 2016, the 
Department reported that Father had “not engaged in services or 
moved back into the family home since the last hearing held on 
June 2, 2016.” The Department indicated, “As a result, [AB] is 
in Foster Custody with the DHS, but was able to remain in [KL]’s 
care. [KL] applied for, and qualified to be, a DHS special 
9 17 HAR § 1625 provides for licensing of foster families as 
“resource caregivers.”

          licensed resource parent to [AB]. [AB] is very bonded with [KL], 
who is the mother to [AB]’s half sister, and has known her 
several years prior to placement.” 
The Department further reported that since the last 
review period, Father had minimal contact with KL and DHS, and 
had not followed through with any recommended services. The 
report provided, “[AB] has visits with paternal and maternal 
relatives and enjoys spending time with them. [KL] makes efforts 
to ensure [AB] has family visits with her relatives” and “has 
made efforts to encourage Father to see his daughter, but without 
success.” 
The  report   noted  that  AB’s  maternal  relatives, 
including  her  maternal  great-aunt,  SH,  recently  visited  AB  and  PD 
in  Hawai i.   “Maternal   great  aunt  has  expressed  to  this  worker 
her  concerns  for  [AB],  and  has  requested  to  be  considered  for 
permanent  placement  since  [Father]  has  not  successfully  reunified 
with  his  daughter.   An  [Interstate  Compact  on  Placement  of 
Children  (ICPC)  study]  has  been  generated  by  the  DHS  in  order  to 
consider  her  request.”  
5. Termination
 of Parental Rights, Permanent Plan, and 
Order Awarding Permanent Custody to the Department 
On November 2, 2016, the Department filed a Motion to 
Terminate Parental Rights, which was set for hearing on March 10, 
2017. Attached to the Motion was a Permanent Plan dated 
8           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
  
 
   
   
       
       
          
       
        
       
        
      
          
          
             
            
          
          
          
          . . . 
  . . . 
  . . . November  1,  2016.   As  outlined  in  the  Plan,  the  Department’s 
permanency  goal  for  AB  was  for  “[p]arental  rights  to  be  divested 
at  the  next  court  hearing”  and  for  AB  “to  be  under  permanent 
placement  with  DHS  by  the  next  court  hearing.”   In  relevant  part, 
the  plan  stated: 10 
Child’s current situation 
[AB],  nine-years- old,  is  a  smart,  outgoing  and  active 
young  lady.   She  has  demonstrated  a  lot  of  resiliency 
and  is  doing  very  well  in  her  current  placement.  
Prior  to  this  placement,  she  had  been  living  in  a  DHS 
general  licensed  resource  home  with  her  sister,  PD, 
before  they  were  both  reunified  with  their  respective 
fathers.   [AB]  has  bonded  with  [KL],  and  considers  her 
to  be  her  hanai  aunty.   [KL]  has  a  younger  daughter  by 
[Father],  so  [AB]  is  able  to  live  with  her  half-
sister,  as  well. 
Co
nnections 
Besides living with [her paternal half-sister, TL], 
[AB] has visits with [her maternal half-sister, PD], 
as well as other extended maternal and paternal 
family. [AB] has not had visits with her parents for 
several months due to their lack of contact. 
Pl
acement 
As
sessment of the safety of the child’s placement: 
There are no safety indicators in this current 
placement at this time. A Safety of Placement 
Assessment completed on October 26, 2016, indicates 
10 Pursuant to HRS § 587-27, the Permanent Plan “is a specific 
written plan, prepared by an appropriate authorized agency,” that must set 
forth information about the plan for the child in foster custody. Among other 
things, the Permanent Plan must include “[a] position as to whether the court 
should order an adoption, guardianship, or permanent custody of the child,” 
and “[t]he objectives concerning the child, including, but not limited to, 
stable placement, education, health, therapy, counseling, birth family . . . 
culture, and adoption, guardianship, or preparation for independent living.”

The placement is considered a stable placement at this

              proposed Permanent Plan, the Department filed a Safe Family Home 
Report.12 The content and tone of this report differed from the 
November 2016 Permanent Plan in that it emphasized the 
willingness of AB’s maternal great-aunt to adopt her, but did not 
mention KL’s expressed desire to do the same. This report also 
failed to mention AB’s ties to her half siblings or extended 
paternal family. The Department did not explain this shift in 
focus from KL toward AB’s maternal relatives. 
On March 10, 2017, the court held a hearing on the 
Motion to Terminate Parental Rights. KL attended;13 Mother and 
Father did not. After hearing evidence and argument, the court 
stated its findings, divested Father and Mother of their parental 
rights, appointed the Department as permanent custodian of AB, 
and adopted the terms of the November 2016 Permanent Plan, which 
appeared to favor placement with KL. The court dismissed Mother 
and Father as parties and set a permanency review adoption 
hearing for August 3, 2017.14 
12 The Safe Family Home Report has two parts. “The first section is 
the narrative discussion of the information requested by the Safe Family Home 
Guidelines” set forth in HRS § 587A-27. DHS Child Welfare Services Procedures 
Manual § 3.3. “The second section is a listing of the guidelines as they 
appear in HRS [§] 587-25.” Id. The guidelines were originally set forth in 
§ 587-25 but were moved to § 587A-27 in 2010. 
13 KL had the authority to attend this hearing pursuant to HRS 
§ 587A-14(d), which provides that “[t]he child’s current resource family is 
entitled to participate in the proceedings to provide information to the 
court, either in person or in writing, concerning the current status of the 
child in their care.” 
14 It is not clear from the record whether this date was meant to be 
a hearing on a specific pending adoption petition or merely a permanency 
hearing required under HRS § 587A-31(a) to be held “every six months [ ] if

            On  April  3,  2017,  the  court  entered  its  written  Order 
Awarding  Permanent  Custody,  which  contained   the  same  findings  and 
conclusions  stated  in  its  oral  ruling,  but  also  included  Finding 
of  Fact  G,  which  stated,  “Currently  there  is  no  responsible  and 
competent  substitute  family  willing  and  able  to  assume  the  duties 
of  permanent  custody  of  the  child[.]”  
6. Proposal to Visit New Hampshire 
On  March  17,  2017,   one  week  after  the  hearing,  the 
Department  submitted  a  letter  to  the  court  proposing  that  AB 
visit  her  relatives  in  New  Hampshire  during  her  summer  vacation.   
The  letter  requested  travel  from  June  1,  2017  to  July  7,  2017, 
and  explained: 
[AB]’s maternal great aunt and uncle, [SH] and [JH], 
are interested in adopting [AB]. The [Department] 
would like to allow the child to spend some time with 
them beforehand, to get better acquainted. The DHS 
believes this would help the child and the extended 
family prepare for this transition before the adoption 
hearing. [SH] has agreed to escort [AB] both to and 
from New Hampshire for this trip. 
If  the  extend ed  visit  goes  well,  [SH  and  JH]  have 
agreed  to  fly  back  to  Hawaii   to  atten d  the  adoption 
hearing,  then  take  [AB]  back  with  them  to  their  home 
in  New  Hampshire.   The  DHS  was  awarded  Permanent 
Custody  of  [AB]  on  March  10,  2017. 
The adopti
on hearing is scheduled for August 3, 2017, 
at 2 p.m. A home study by the DHS, via an ICPC, was 
completed on January 18, 2017, which found [SH’s] home 
appropriate for placement. 
On March 22, 2017, twelve days after the termination 
(...continued) 
the child remains in the permanent custody of the department or an authorized 
agency.”

           hearing, the Department submitted a report to the court regarding 
AB’s status. The report noted that AB’s maternal great-aunt, SH, 
has “continued to express great desire and interest in [AB]’s 
well-being” and that AB’s visit to New Hampshire over summer 
break will “allow them the opportunity to bond as well as explore 
possible permanent placement, if all goes well.” The report also 
noted, however, that KL, “as well as [the father of AB’s maternal 
half-sister, PD], have also expressed interest in adopting [AB]. 
All of these placements are under consideration by the DHS, and a 
decision is hoped to be made by the next review hearing.” 
On April 3, 2017,15 AB’s GAL, Kay Iopa, submitted a 
status report to the court concerning the Department’s travel 
request. The GAL stated: 
On March 23, 2017, I reviewed a file stamped travel 
letter/order. Said document indicates I was 
contacted. That is true. However, the document omits 
the fact that I strongly opposed the travel as 
scheduled. 
Further, I also oppose the permanent placement of [AB] 
in her current foster home. Repeated efforts have 
been made to discuss this with DHS, but DHS disregards 
GAL’s concerns.[16] 
15 The GAL dated the letter and the certificate of service April 4, 
2017. However, the letter was file-stamped by the court on April 3, 2017 at 
10:52 a.m. 
16 This was the first instance in the record in which the GAL 
directly stated her opposition to AB’s permanent placement with KL. She did 
not explain why she was opposed. However, between the November 2016 Permanent 
Plan, which was favorable to KL, and the GAL’s April 2017 opposition to AB’s 
placement with KL, KL had requested respite care for “seven to ten days” due 
to AB’s behavioral challenges. DHS Case Manager Michelle Starosky denied KL’s 
request and indicated that placing AB with another resource caregiver for that 
time would be detrimental to her. Respite care was thus not utilized. After 
this incident, DHS “began to look more seriously at the other [placement

          It
 would appear that the Court will need to make 
appropriate rulings regarding travel and adoption at a 
contested hearing . 
On  May  8,  2017,  the  GAL  filed  a  Motion  to  Modify  Travel 
Order  or  Alternatively  Advance  Adoption  Hearing,  asking  that  AB 
remain  in  New  Hampshire  after  she  arrives,  rather  than  returning 
to  Hawai i,  pending  adoption  by  her  maternal   extended  relatives.  
In  the  GAL’s  declaration,  she  explained  in  relevant  part: 
3. [SH] and [JH] . . . have repeatedly told me they 
want to adopt [AB]. 
4. A home study was conducted in January 2017 and [SH 
and JH’s] home was found appropriate for placement; 
5. I am aware that DHS has arranged for [AB] to visit 
[SH and JH] in New Hampshire for less than 30 days 
this summer; 
6. As GAL, I find this visit is appropriate as [AB] 
has never been to New Hampshire and her only contact 
with [SH and JH] has been during their trips to 
Hawai i and by tele communication; 
7. However, I have grave concerns about the travel 
schedule which leaves [AB] and [SH and JH] in a state 
of monthly cross-continental travel and uncertainty; 
and 
8. Therefore, as GAL, I believe it is in [AB’s] best 
interest to remain in New Hampshire till the August 3, 
2017 adoption hearing or advance the adoption hearing 
to July 7, 2017 when [AB] is scheduled to return to 
Hawai i.

options]” for AB. 
The GAL’s April 2017 report also did not address AB’s wishes with 
respect to the New Hampshire visit or her permanent placement. As of this 
point, the most recent indication in the record of AB’s wishes is in the 
November 2, 2016 Permanent Plan, which stated: “[AB] . . . has expressed to 
[DHS] that she would like to remain in [KL]’s care.”

           A  hearing  on  the  GAL’s  motion  was  scheduled  for 
June  22,  2017.  The  length  of  AB’s  trip  to  New  Hampshire  was 
therefore  not  entirely  settled  by  the  time  her  trip  began  on 
June  11,  2017. 17 
7. SH’s Second Motion to Intervene
 
On  June  14,  2017,  a  few  days   after  AB  arrived  in  New 
Hampshire,  SH  filed  a  second  Motion  to  Intervene.  18 
The  Department  filed  a  memorandum  in  opposition  to  this 
motion,  arguing  that  SH  did  not  establish  that  she  had  a  right  to 
intervene  pursuant  to  HFCR  Rule  24(a)  or  permission  to  do  so 
pursuant  to  Rule  24(b).   After  a  hearing   on   June  22,  2017,  the 19 
17 The hearing on this motion was held on July 13, 2017. 
18 Citing communication issues with the Deputy AG, SH sought to be a 
party to ensure “that appropriate coordination and communication may take 
place and so that [SH and JH] have a representative . . . to advocate for them 
with regard to this matter.” SH argued that she had a right to intervene 
under Hawaii  Rules of Ap pellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 24(a)(2) due to her 
interest in adopting AB. “In light of the fact that the DHS is considering [SH 
and JH] as adoptive parents for [AB],” SH argued, “they have a cognizable 
legal interest in the custody of [AB].” 
Moreover, SH argued that she and her husband had a right to 
intervene because of their blood relationship to her. According to SH, if she 
were “not permitted to intervene at this time,” then her “interest in making 
sure that [AB] is placed in a safe and loving home that is prepared to be a 
permanent placement may not receive adequate consideration[.]” SH argued that 
“[d]ecisions regarding placement and/or adoption made without [SH’s] input 
. . . could impair or impede” her ability to protect her interest in adopting 
AB. 
Further, SH argued that she should be considered a “party” to the 
case pursuant to HRS § 587A-4, which defines a “party” to include “any other 
person . . . if the court finds that such person’s participation is in the 
best interest of the child.” SH argued that allowing her to intervene would 
be in AB’s best interests because it would require the court to decide as soon 
as possible which home placement is best for AB. 
19 In addition, the memorandum states that “DHS is already addressing 
[SH]’s concerns. She is being informed of case status, offered phone

8. July 13, 2017 Hearing 
On July 13, 2017, the Family Court held a status 
hearing on the GAL’s Motion to Modify Travel Order or 
Alternatively Advance Adoption Hearing. Shortly after the 
hearing began, the GAL and the Department stated that they both 
now agreed to change AB’s foster placement to New Hampshire and 
continue the adoption hearing. KL, who was in attendance, then 
caught the court’s attention and indicated she would like to 
speak. Over the Department’s and GAL’s objections, the court 
allowed KL to provide her input on AB’s situation based on KL’s 
status as AB’s resource caregiver. 
KL presented a statement emphasizing her prominent role 
in AB’s life, “not only as a resource caregiver but as a hanai 
auntie, stepmom, and mother of her biological paternal half 
sibling, [TL], who she currently resides with.” KL stated that 
“[AB] also sees paternal family regularly, aunties, uncles, 
cousins, as well as my family who have hanaied her as their own.” 
KL went on to say that she felt “as if nobody is looking into 
[AB’s] life here and now and exactly how much she is thriving but 
instead assuming her life will be better in New Hampshire.” KL 
asked that the family court “make things pono with this case” and 
(...continued) 
visitation and was allowed to have the child for one week while she was on 
Hawai i Island a nd it is my belief that the child is having her first visit in 
[their] home now.”

        requested “a restraining order be placed on this case to keep 
things status quo, have [AB] [ ] flown back to Hawaii until this 
matter gets properly addressed by the court and provide me time 
to seek adequate legal counsel.” She further stated that she 
“provided for and love[s] [AB] and want[s] to continue to love 
and provide for [her] through adoption.” KL stated: 
[AB] was told, as was I, by [DHS Case Manager Michelle 
Starosky], that she would be in New Hampshire for a 
month to allow her time to visit and get to know them, 
to see if there was a possibility she may want to live 
there . . . I realized I had been outright lied to, 
manipulated and suppressed[.] 
When KL finished, the family court stated, “Okay. Thank 
you for that input.” The court did not rule on or further 
acknowledge KL’s requests, nor did it orally state any findings 
or issue any orders. 
9. July 31, 2017 Order Continuing Permanent Custody and 
Changing AB’s Placement to New Hampshire 
On July 31, 2017, the Family Court entered an Order 
Continuing Permanent Custody, which modified AB’s placement from 
KL’s home to the State of New Hampshire, with SH and JH. The 
Order did not mention KL’s requests from the hearing.20 
20 The Order is somewhat cryptic. It is reproduced here: 
/ Under the circumstances that are presented in this 
case, DHS has made reasonable efforts to finalize the 
permanency plan which in this case is permanent out of 
home placement; 
| It is in the best interests of the child that the 
prior award of permanent custody be continued in her 
new placement located in New Hampshire with [SH and 
JH];

      10. Petitions for Adoption 
On August 21, 2017, the Department filed a Petition for 
Adoption of AB by SH and JH, FC-A No. 17-1-0029. The hearing was 
scheduled to take place September 7, 2017.21 
Previously, on July 13, 2017, KL had filed a pro se 
petition for non-consent adoption of AB, FC-A No. 17-1-0019. It 
appears that there was no Notice of Hearing or Certificate of 
Service with this petition. 
11. KL’s Motion to Intervene 
On August 21, 2017, KL, having obtained counsel, filed 
a Motion to Intervene. KL argued that she had a right to 
intervene pursuant to HFCR Rule 24(a) and (c). She sought “to 
protect the best interests of [AB], for whom [KL] has assumed the 
role of parent and established a bonded relationship, and for 
whom she was providing a stable and healthy home environment 
until the abrupt change of placement[.]” She also sought “to 
/
 The permanent plan dated November 1, 2016 is in 
the best interest of the child; 
/ The present placement is appropriate, safe, and 
necessary[.] 
Although it is unclear, it appears that the family court used proposed 
findings of fact submitted by the AG’s office, marking with slashes those 
findings it chose not to adopt, and numbering sequentially those it did adopt. 
Under this reading, the vertical line in front of the second finding above is 
actually the number 1. If this interpretation is correct, this Order 
indicates a reversal of the family court’s April 3, 2017 adoption of the terms 
of the November 1, 2016 permanent plan. There is no explanation for this 
reversal. 
21 The ROA in the instant case refers to the adoption proceedings, 
but does not include records from them.

            protect her own rights as Hanai relative to [AB], and to protect 
and defend her minor daughter [TL]’s rights as blood sibling to 
[AB].” 
KL stated that she wished to adopt AB, and argued that 
the Department and GAL’s positions were contrary to AB’s best 
interests and based on a “relative preference” that was found 
impermissible in In re AS, 132 Hawai i 368, 322 P.3d 263  (2014). 
KL  requested  that  the   court  grant  her  status  to 
intervene  nunc  pro  tunc  to  July  13,  2017.   KL  argued,  “Despite 
the  surreptitious  and  abrupt  manner  in  which  the  change  of 
placement  was  brought  up,  and  even  without  the  benefit  of 
counsel,  [KL]  made  a  Motion  to  the  Court  orally  on  July  13, 
seeking  to  obtain  relief  on  the  grounds  incorporated  in  the 
present  Motion,”  stated  in  the  letter  she  read  aloud  at  the 
hearing.   Noting  that  she  “asked  the  [c]ourt  to  make  things  pono, 
maintain  the  status  quo,  and  allow  her  time  to  seek  legal 
counsel”  at  the  July  13  hearing,  KL  argued  that  such  requests 
should  be  construed  as  a  motion  to  intervene.  
The  GAL  submitted  a  memorandum  in  opposition  to  KL’s 
Motion  to  Intervene.   The  GAL  argued  that  KL  “urges  the  [c]ourt 
to  engage  in  a  giant  leap  of  judicial  activism”  by  recognizing 
KL’s  right  to  intervene  based  on  the  hānai  tradition.   She 
contended  that  it  would  “create  a  whole  new  right  superior  of 
parental  rights,”  that  would  survive  termination  of  parental 
rights.   As  such,  the  GAL  argued  that  KL  “failed  to  present  legal 
19           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
         
          
            
           
         
      
           
              
     
   
          
         
          
             
             
            
            
            
             
           
    authority to establish her right to intervene.” The Department 
also opposed the motion, arguing that KL “has no legal interest” 
to support a right to intervene, as she has “no right to custody 
[or] visitation, nor is she the parent of this child.” The 
Department argued that allowing KL to intervene “may cause delays 
and prejudice to the remaining parties.” 
On  September  5,  2017,  KL  submitted  a  Supplemental  
Memorandum  in  Support  of  Motion  to  Intervene.   KL  argued  that  she 
was  entitled  to  challenge  the  Department’s  placement  of  AB  in  New 
Hampshire  because  her  interests  as  a  hānai  parent  constitute 
“an  interest  relating  to  the  .  .  .  parental  rights  of  a  minor 
child”  under  HFCR  Rule  24(a)(2).   She  also  argued  that  she  was 
entitled  to  intervene  to  protect  her  daughter’s  inheritance 
rights,  citing  HRS  §§  532-4  and  -8.  22 
KL argued that it would be in the
 best interest of AB 
to add KL as a party, and thus the court should define KL as a 
“party” under HRS § 587A-4. 
12. September 7, 2017 Hearing 
On September 7, 2017, the court held a hearing on KL’s 
Motion to Intervene. After hearing the parties’ arguments, the 
court stated that while KL’s counsel “[did] raise issues that the 
22 KL argued that she was a hānai relative as defined in HRS § 587A-
4. In this chapter, part of the Child Protective Act, “hanai relative” is 
defined as “an adult, other than a blood relative, whom the court or 
department has found by credible evidence to perform or to have performed a 
substantial role in the upbringing or material support of a child, as attested 
to by the written or oral designation of the child or of another person, 
including other relatives of the child.” As noted previously, KL’s hānai 
st
atus is not in dispute.

the reasons set forth in the Department’s memorandum in 
opposition. 
13. September 18, 2017 Permanent Plan 
On September 18, 2017, the Department submitted a new 
Permanent Plan, which stated the goal of adoption by SH and JH at 
the next court hearing, scheduled for November 2, 2017. 
14. KL’s Motion for Reconsideration of the Order Denying 
the Motion to Intervene 
The  court  entered  a   written  order  denying  KL’s  Motion 
to  Intervene  on  October  9,  2017.   Thereafter,  on  October  17, 
2017,  KL  filed  a  Motion  for  Reconsideration  pursuant  to  HFCR  Rule 
59.   At  a  hearing  on  November  6,  2017,  the  court  addressed  KL’s 
Motion  for  Reconsideration  and  a  few  other  pending  matters.  
The court held that
 because it had already consolidated 
the competing adoption petitions and allowed the parties to 
access the documents from the original child welfare case, the 
motion to reconsider was moot. The court filed a written order 
denying the motion on December 21, 2017, and KL timely appealed. 
The adoption evidentiary hearing was scheduled for 
January 29, 2018.

B. ICA Proceedings 
1. Opening Brief 
On  appeal,  KL  challenged:  (1)  the  Order  Awarding  
Permanent  Custody,  entered  April  3,  2017;  (2)  the  Order 
Continuing  Permanent  Custody,  entered  July  31,  2017;  (3)  the 
Order  Denying
  Motion  to  Intervene  entered  October  9,  2017;  and 
(4)  the  Order  Denying  Motion  for  Reconsideration  of  Order  Denying 
Motion  to  Intervene  entered   October   9,  2017,  entered   December   21, 
2017.  24 
Regarding the April 3 Order Awarding
 Permanent Custody, 
KL challenged Finding of Fact G - “Currently there is no 
responsible and competent substitute family willing and able to 
assume the duties of permanent custody of the child” - as plain 
error. KL argued that pursuant to HRS § 587A-33(a), “the court 
was required to find by clear and convincing evidence that the 
proposed Permanent Plan is in the best interest of the child, and 
to presume that it was in the child’s best interest to be 
23 KL  sought  an  order  directing  Judge  Nagata  to  (1)  grant  her  
August  21,  2017  Motion  to  Intervene  in  FC-S  No.  15-0007  nunc  pro  tunc  to 
July  13,  2017  (the  date  of  the  change  of  placement  hearing);  (2)  grant  her 
August  21,  2017  Motion  for  an  Emergency  Change  of  Placement;  (3)  release  to 
her  the  complete  transcripts  of  the  proceedings  held  on  September  7,  2017, 
November  2,  2017,  and  November  6,  2017  in  FC-S- No.  15-0007;  (4)  vacate  the 
April  3,  2017  Order  Awarding  Permanent  Custody  of  AB  to  DHS;  and  (5)  recuse 
herself  from  further  presiding  over  FC-S  No.  15-0007,  FC-A  No.  17-0019,  and 
FC-A  No.  17-0029.  
24 KL  argued  that  she  did  not  discover  the  errors  from  (1)  the   Order 
Awarding  Permanent  Custody  and  (2)  the  Order  Continuing  Permanent  Custody 
until  after  her  Motion  to  Intervene  and  Motion  for  Reconsideration  were 
denied.  
22           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
      
 
          
          
          
           
        
         
           
        
           
       
         
         
        
         
            
          
        
           
           
          permanently  placed  with  responsible  and  competent  substitute 
parents  in  a  safe  and  secure  home.”   While  Finding  of  Fact  G 
stated  that  there  was  no  suitable  substitute  family,  no  evidence 
was  introduced  to  support  that  finding.  
Regarding the Order Continuing Permanent Custody, KL 
challenged the Finding of Fact that “[i]t is in the best interest 
of the child that the prior award of permanent custody be 
continued in her new placement located in New Hampshire” as plain 
error. KL argued that pursuant to HRS § 587A-31(c), the court 
must make written findings including, among other things, “(2) 
[w]hether the current placement of the child continues to be 
appropriate and in the best interests of the child or if another 
in-state or out-of-state placement should be considered[.]” The 
court concluded that placing AB in New Hampshire would be in her 
best interests without first “addressing whether the current 
placement with [KL] continued to be appropriate.” Thus, KL 
argued, the court’s failure to state its findings regarding AB’s 
current placement at the time was plain error. 
Moreover, KL argued that under In re AS, 132 Hawai i 
368, 322
 P.3d 263, the court “is the final arbiter of whether a 
proposed change in placement is in the best interests of a 
minor,” and the court should reject the Department’s placement 
decision “if it is shown by a preponderance of the evidence that 
the change of placement is not in the child’s best interests.” 
KL contends that she “had a right to dispute the Department’s 
23           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
         
         
         
      
  
     
          
            
           
        
          
            
          
           
          
          
    
       
           
         
         
         
        
         
          proposed change of placement, and the [c]ourt was required to 
make an independent determination of the matter.” According to 
KL, “[t]he failure of the [c]ourt to make an independent 
determination before adopting the Department’s recommendation was 
plain error.” 
Furthermore, KL argued that the Department’s 
recognition of KL as AB’s hānai mother “granted her legal  status 
as AB’s relative, and her home as AB’s family home.” She argued 
that this recognition conferred a benefit to KL, AB, and TL “by 
recognizing their traditional Hawaiian Ohana as a family,” and 
thus the Department was required to give them “a fair opportunity 
to be heard and a fair process by which it would be determined 
that their family would be broken up against their will, before 
taking action to separate them.” In support of this due process 
argument, KL cited Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 481 (1982), 
Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 (1970), and Mathews v. Eldridge , 
424 U.S. 319, 335 (1976). 
Regarding the Order Denying Motion to Intervene, KL 
argued that the court erred by denying this motion based on lack 
of standing, rather than addressing the merits of her challenge 
to the Department’s placement decision. She contended that the 
court “adopted the Department’s argument that [KL] was merely a 
former resource care-giver without an interest in the case, 
overlooking the nunc pro tunc character of the Motion to 
Intervene.” KL also claimed that “the record itself is clear” 
24           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
          
          
      
          
          
           
        
          
         
         
  
 
        
        
         
          
          
         
         
          
        
        
         
         that KL indeed had standing, because at the July 13, 2017 
hearing, the court “already ruled that [KL] did have standing[.]” 
Regarding the Order Denying Motion for Reconsideration, 
KL argued that the family court erred in ruling that her 
challenge in the instant case was moot due to consolidation of 
the competing adoption petitions. KL argued that if she “were to 
have overturned the Department’s choice, and regained custody of 
AB, then under HRS § 578(2)(a)(6), her consent would be required 
to any proposed adoption of AB, which in the present 
circumstances would allow her to withhold consent to the New 
Hampshire adoption.” 
2. Answering Brief 
In its Answering Brief, the Department argued KL lacked 
standing to challenge (1) the Order  Awarding Permanent Custody 
and (2) the Order Continuing Permanent Custody, as she was 
“neither a parent, nor a party to [AB]’s custody proceeding” and 
was thus not “affected or prejudiced by the appealable order.” 
The Department argued that while the court allowed KL to 
participate in the July 13, 2017 hearing as AB’s resource 
caregiver, the transcript “is clear that the family court did not 
determine that [KL] had standing to contest custody.” 
Moreover, the Department
 argued that even if KL had 
standing, her appeal of the custody orders was untimely under 
Rule 3 of the Rules Expediting Child Protective Appeals (RECPA), 
25           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
             
          
         
         
         
         
       
         
       
          
           
       
   
        
           
         
          
         
        
   
         
          
           
          
       
      
        
      
        
         
      and HRAP Rule 4.25 Citing the 30-day window to file a notice of 
appeal, the Department noted that KL’s appeal was filed 277 days 
after the Order Awarding Permanent Custody was ordered and 158 
days after the Order Continuing Permanent Custody was ordered. 
Because “[t]here is no statutory exception allowing for such late 
filings,” the Department argued that the ICA should not address 
the merits of these two appeals. 
The Department also argued that KL’s points lack merit. 
Regarding the Order Awarding Permanent Custody, the Department 
contended that Finding G was harmless error pursuant to HFCR Rule 
6126 because such a finding “is not a statutory requirement in an 
order terminating parental rights and awarding permanent custody 
to the DHS[.]” 
With regard to KL’s claim that the Department conferred 
a benefit by recognizing her as the hānai parent of AB, the 
Department asserted that this argument was not raised at the 
March 10, 2017 hearing on the termination of parental rights and, 
25 Although the Department did not cite it, the statute giving 
authority for HRAP Rule 4 is HRS § 641-1. 
26 HFCR Rule 61 provides: 
No error in either the admission or the exclusion of 
evidence and no error or defect in any ruling or order 
or in anything done or omitted by the court or by any 
of the parties is ground for granting a new trial or 
for setting aside a verdict or for vacating, 
modifying, or otherwise disturbing a judgment or 
order, unless refusal to take such action appears to 
the court inconsistent with substantial justice. The 
court at every stage of the proceeding must disregard 
any error or defect in the proceeding that does not 
affect the substantial rights of the parties. 
26           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
            
       
           
          
        
           
          
        
             
     
        
        
          
          
         
        
     
 
         
           
         
           
      
        
         in any event, such an argument does not have a legal basis. 
The Department also argued that KL “fails to 
substantiate the claim that she has a de facto right to custody 
of [AB] as a contracted resource parent.” The Department noted 
that “[a]s a resource caregiver, [KL] had a contractual 
relationship with the DHS to care for the child,” which is not 
the same thing as “custody of the Child.” The Department 
contended that because “[f]oster custody and permanent custody of 
[AB] was with the DHS,” KL did not have de facto custody of AB 
pursuant to HRS § 571-46(a)(2). 
Finally, the Department argued that it was not a 
manifest abuse of discretion to deny KL’s Motion for 
Reconsideration, as KL did not present any new evidence, and the 
matters raised in the motion had already been addressed by the 
court. Moreover, the Department asserted that the court properly 
deemed the motion to reconsider unnecessary once it consolidated 
the competing petitions for adoption. 
3. Reply Brief 
In her Reply Brief, KL again asserted that the court 
recognized that she had standing at the July 13, 2017 hearing. 
She contended that the Department failed to support its claim 
that the trial court satisfied its duty to hold a hearing and 
make independent recommendations before changing AB’s placement, 
and that “the Department avoided answering the question of 
whether [KL] was entitled to a contested hearing before the 
27           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
           
       
        
         
    
        
        
          
           
   
      
                   
       
         
          
          
        
       
    
   
        
          
          
        change of placement, when it was properly before the court.” 
KL also asserted that the Motion for Reconsideration 
presented newly discovered evidence, and that her efforts to 
contest the change of placement in the original child protection 
proceeding were not moot. 
Regarding the claim that Finding G in the Order 
Awarding Permanent Custody was harmless error, KL contends that 
HRS § 587A-33 “does require the court to make that determination, 
and the Department does not show why that section of the statute 
should be ignored.” 
Additionally, with regard to the Order Continuing 
Permanent Custody, KL raised the new argument that in addition to 
“ma[king] no finding as to whether AB’s placement with [KL] 
continued to be appropriate[,]” this Order improperly “contains, 
side by side, two contradictory findings[.]” KL asserted that 
the court’s finding that it was in AB’s best interests to 
continue the “new placement in New Hampshire with [SH and JH]” 
contradicted the other finding that “[t]he present placement is 
appropriate, safe, and necessary,” given that the “present 
placement” was with KL. 
4. ICA Summary Disposition Order 
On November 30, 2018, the ICA entered its Summary 
Disposition Order (SDO). The ICA held that it lacked appellate 
jurisdiction over the appeal of the April 3, 2017 Order Awarding 
Permanent Custody and the July 31, 2017 Order Continuing 
28           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
       
    
      
       
        
            
         
         
       
       
        
   Permanent  Custody,  due  to  untimeliness.   The  ICA  determined  that 
the  Order  Awarding  Permanent  Custody  was  immediately  appealable, 
citing  In  re  Doe,  77  Hawai i  109,  114-15,  883   P.2d  30,  35-36 
(1994),  and  thus  an  appeal  should  have  been  filed  within  30  days 
of  its  entry.   The  ICA  determined  the  same  with  regard  to  the 
Order  Continuing  Permanent  Custody.   Because  neither  order  had 
been  appealed  within  the  30-day  window  set  by  HRAP  Rule  4 
pursuant  to  HRS  §  641-1,  the  ICA  held  that  it  lacked  appellate 
jurisdiction  over  them. 
The  ICA  also  determined   that  even  if  these  appeals  were 
timely  filed,  KL  would  lack  standing  to  bring  such  a  challenge: 
When the Order Awarding Custody was entered, KL was 
not a party and had not sought to intervene in this 
proceeding for termination of parental rights. KL 
lacks standing to enforce the parental rights of AB’s 
mother [ ] or father [ ]. In re F Children , Nos. 
2882, 2883, and 1884, 2009 WL 1300933 (Haw. App. May 
9, 2009) (mem. op.) at *8 (Father lacks standing to 
enforce Mother’s parental rights). Mother and Father 
did not appeal the termination of their parental 
rights to AB. Therefore, the termination of their 
parental rights is final. 
With  regard  to  the  Order  Denying  Motion  to  Intervene, 
the  ICA  rejected  KL’s  arguments  that  the  Family  Court  erred  in 
not  recognizing  her  standing  at  the  September  7,  2017  hearing, 
and  that  it  had  previously  recognized  her  standing  as  a  party  at 
the  July  13,  2017  hearing.   The  ICA  determined  that  the  Family 
Court  allowed  KL  to  speak  at  the  July  13,  2017  hearing  because 
she  was  AB’s  resource  caregiver,  which  was  consistent  with  HRS  § 
587A-14(d)  (2006).   The  ICA  noted  that  “[t]he  Family  Court  made 
29           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
       
    
    
        
        
         
       
      
         
       
         
        
       
      
       
        
     
           
       
      
     
     no  finding  at  the  July  13,  2017  hearing  that  it  was  in  AB’s  best 
interest  to  allow  KL  to  participate  in  this  termination 
proceeding  as  a  party  or  a  person  with  standing  to  be  a  party.”  
The  ICA  also  determined  that  “contrary  to  KL’s  argument  on 
appeal,  KL  did  not  and  could  not  have  orally  requested  to 
intervene  during  that  hearing  because  a  motion  to  intervene  under 
HFCR  Rule  24(c)  must  be  made  in  writing.”  
Nevertheless,  the  ICA  agreed  that  KL’s  Motion  to 
Intervene  and  Motion  for  Reconsideration  should  have  been  granted 
on  the  basis  of  KL’s  submission  of  a  petition  to  adopt  AB.   The 
ICA  reasoned  as  follows: 
HFCR Rule 24(a)(2) requires a family court to permit 
intervention by anyone who claims an interest in the 
custody or visitation of the subject minor child when 
the applicant is “so situated that the disposition of 
the action may as a practical matter impair or impede 
the applicant’s ability to protect that interest[.]” 
We conclude that, upon the post-termination submission 
of a petition for adoption of a minor child, the 
adoption petitioner is claiming an interest in the 
custody or visitation of the child and is so situated 
that the disposition of the placement issues in the 
termination of parental rights action may, as a 
practical matter, impair or impede the adoption 
petitioner’s ability to protect that interest. It 
cannot be ignored that, as a practical matter, post-
termination placement decisions can impact adoption 
proceedings in a variety of ways. That is not to say 
that the adoption petitioner’s interest must be given 
particular weight, but such petitioners should be 
permitted to intervene, post-termination, to ensure 
that their interests are adequately protected. 
The  ICA  recognized  that  “[h]ere,  if  at  the  time  the 
family  court  denied  KL’s  motion  to  intervene,  there  was  a  pending 
petition  for  adoption  filed  on  behalf  of  KL,  then  the  Family 
30           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
           
            
            
          
           
       
          
           
       
       
        Court erred in denying the motion to intervene.” The ICA noted 
the same with regard to SH and JH: “the Family Court also denied 
a post-termination motion to intervene filed by SH and JH. If at 
the time the Family Court denied that motion, a petition for 
adoption on behalf of SH and JH was pending, then the Family 
Court also erred in denying that motion.” 
The  ICA  disagreed,   however,  with  KL’s  contention  that 
the  family  court  should  have  necessarily  granted  the  Motion  to 
Intervene  nunc  pro  tunc.   The  ICA  noted  that  KL  did  not  cite 
authority  for  this  proposition,  and  the  ICA  found  none.   The  ICA 
also  held  that  because  KL  did  not  file  a  written  motion  to 
intervene  on  July  13,  2017,  she  was  not  entitled  to  have  her 
status  as  a  party  be  retroactive  to  that  date.  
Finally,  with   regard  to  the  Order  Denying  the  Motion 
for  Reconsideration,  the  ICA  addressed  KL’s  argument  that  the 
family  court  incorrectly  considered  her  arguments  moot  upon 
consolidating  the  two  adoption  petitions.   Specifically,  the  ICA 
considered  KL’s  argument  that,  if  she  were  permitted  to  intervene 
and  then  were  able  to  “overturn[]  the  DHS’s  choice  of  resource 
caregiver  placement”  and  “regain  custody  of  AB,  then  KL’s  consent 
would  have  been  required  for  any  proposed  adoption  of  AB[.]”   
The ICA
 held that KL’s consent to adoption would not be 
required under HRS § 578-2(a) even if AB were returned to her 
care. The ICA cited HRS § 578-2(a): 
(a) Persons required to consent to adoption. Unless 
consent is not required or is dispensed with under

      su
bsection (c) hereof, a petition to adopt a child may 
be granted only if written consent to the proposed 
adoption has been executed by: 
(1) The mother of the child; 
(2) A legal father as to whom the child is a 
legitimate child; 
(3) An adjudicated father whose relationship to the 
child has been determined by a court; 
(4) A presumed father under section 578-2(d); 
(5) A concerned natural father who is not the legal, 
adjudicated, or presumed father but who has 
demonstrated a reasonable degree of interest, concern 
or responsibility as to the welfare of a child . . .; 
(6) Any person or agency having legal custody of the 
child or legally empowered to consent; 
(7) The court having jurisdiction of the custody of 
the child, if the legal guardian or legal custodian of 
the person of the child is not empowered to consent to 
adoption; 
(8) The child to be adopted if more than ten years of 
age, unless the court in the best interest of the 
child dispenses with the child’s consent. 
According  to  the  ICA,  even  if  KL  resumed  foster  custody 
of  AB,  this  would  not  constitute  legal  custody  of  AB  such  that 
HRS  §  578-2(a)(6)  would  apply.   The  ICA  referred  to  the 
definition  of  “legal  custody”  under  HRS  §  571-2  and  the 27 
27 HRS § 571-2 states: 
“Legal custody” means the relationship created by the 
court's decree which imposes on the custodian the 
responsibility of physical possession of the minor and

        definition of “foster custody” under HRS § 587A-4.28 The ICA 
recognized that the Department was appointed “as the permanent 
custodian, with the duty to provide food, clothing, shelter, 
psychological care, physical care, medical care, supervision, 
other necessities, and appropriate education to AB.” As such, 
the ICA held, “DHS, not KL, had legal custody of AB and could 
provide consent to an adoption under HRS § 578-2(a)(6). 
The ICA noted that KL presented no other argument on 
appeal that the family court abused its discretion in denying the 
Motion for Reconsideration. Nevertheless, the ICA clarified 
that, “as stated above, if a post-termination petition for 
adoption filed on behalf of KL was pending, then the Family Court 
erred in declining to permit KL to intervene.” 
The ICA concluded as follows: 
For these reasons, KL’s appeal is dismissed in part 
for lack of appellate jurisdiction with respect to the 
Family Court’s April 3, 2017 Order Awarding Permanent 
Custody and the July 31, 2017 Order Continuing 
Permanent Custody. The Family Court’s October 9, 2017 
Order Denying Intervention and December 21, 2017 Order 
Denying Reconsideration are vacated. Recognizing,

28 HRS § 587A-4 states: 
“Foster custody” means the legal status created when 
the department places a child outside of the family 
home with the agreement of the legal custodian or 
pursuant to court order, after the court has 
determined that the child’s family is not presently 
willing and able to provide the child with a safe 
family home, even with the assistance of a service 
plan.

   ho
wever, that AB’s circumstances may have changed and 
the issue of intervention in this termination 
proceeding may be moot, we remand this case to the 
Family Court for such further proceedings as may be 
necessary. 
After  the  SDO  was  entered,  KL  filed  a  Motion  for 
Reconsideration,  which  was  denied. 
C. Certiorari Proceedings 
KL  timely  filed  an   application  for  certiorari,  which 
raises  the  following  questions: 
1. Did Petitioner’s status as Hanai mother of AB 
and head of a Hawaiian Ohana confer substantive 
family rights that could not be abrogated 
without a due process fair hearing with an 
opportunity to be heard, as was requested by 
Petitioner in Family Court on July 13, 2017, 
speaking as “an educated Hawaiian, a mother, a 
resource caregiver, a registered nurse and the 
biological parent of AB’s biological 
sibling”?[29] 
2. What is the minimum showing/quantum of evidence 
sufficient to require a contested hearing on the 
proposed change of placement pursuant to In the 
Interest of A.S., 132 H. 368, 322 P.3d 263 
(2014), and did Petitioner’s July 13, 2017, 
request for a contested hearing meet that 
standard? 
3. Should this Court apply Rule 2, H.R.A.P., to 
reach Petitioner’s claims of plain error in the 
Order Awarding Permanent Custody entered on 
April 3, 2017 and the Order Continuing Permanent 
Custody entered on July 31, 2017, by which 
Petitioner’s & her daughter’s family rights were 
adversely affected, when Petitioner was present 
at the court hearings, but was not a party and 
did not receive copies of the Orders until long 
after the time to file a Notice of Appeal had 
lapsed? 
29 The quoted language is from KL’s statement to the family court on 
July 13, 2017.

    4.
 Was the Family Court’s Finding of Fact G in the 
Order Awarding Permanent Custody, that there was 
“no responsible and competent substitute family 
willing and able to assume the duties of 
permanent custody” clearly erroneous, and if so, 
was the Order Awarding Permanent Custody 
invalid? 
5. Was the Family Court’s Finding of Fact in the 
Order Continuing Permanent Custody that “the 
present placement is appropriate, safe, and 
necessary” inconsistent with its change of 
placement to New Hampshire in the same Order, 
and if so, was the change of placement clearly 
erroneous? 
6. Was Petitioner entitled to have her Motion to 
Intervene, which was filed on August 21, 2017, 
relate back to July 13, 2017, the day that 
Petitioner made her oral Motion to the Court, 
when Petitioner was acting pro se, and actually 
had her Motion written out and read from it to 
the Court? 
Oral  argument  was  held  on  June  20,  2019.   On  June  28, 
2019,  this  court  issued  an  order  vacating  the  family  court’s 
July  13,  2017  order  changing  AB’s  placement  to  New  Hampshire.   We 
ordered  that  the  family  court  conduct  a  contested  placement 
hearing,  “giving  proper  recognition  to  KL’s  status  as  a  hānai 
parent,  as  well  as  AB’s  best  interests.”   We  retained  concurrent 
jurisdiction  to  enter  an  opinion  and  judgment  to  follow  the 
order.  
III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
In  reviewing  family   court  cases,  we  recognize  the 
following  standards. 
35           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
  
     
      
        
         
       
       
        
        
      
      
       
      
       
      
       
         
     
        
        
        
       
       
       
         
       
       
        
    A. Family Court Decisions 
In Fisher v. Fisher, we held: 
Generally, the family court possesses wide discretion 
in making its decisions and those decision[s] will not 
be set aside unless there is a manifest abuse of 
discretion. Thus, we will not disturb the family 
court’s decisions on appeal unless the family court 
disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to 
the substantial detriment of a party litigant and its 
decision clearly exceeded the bounds of reason. 
111  Hawai i  41,  46,  137  P.3d   355,  360  (2006)  (quoting  In  re  Doe, 
95  Hawai i  183,  189-90,  20  P.3d  616,  622-23  (2001)). 
B. Findings of Fact, and
 Conclusions of Law 
On  appeal,  we  review  the  family  court’s   findings  of 
fact 
under the “clearly erroneous” standard. A FOF is 
clearly erroneous when (1) the r ecord lacks 
substantial evidence to support the finding, or (2) 
despite substantial evidence in support of the 
finding, the appellate court is nonetheless left with 
a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been 
made. “Substantial evidence” is credible evidence 
which is of sufficient quality and probative value to 
enable a person of reasonable caution to support a 
conclusion. 
On the oth
er hand, the family court’s COLs are 
reviewed on appeal de novo, under the right/wrong 
standard. COLs, consequently, are “not binding upon an 
appellate court and are freely reviewable for their 
correctness. 
.... 
Mo
reover, the family court is given much leeway in its 
examination of the reports concerning a child’s care, 
custody, and welfare, and its conclusions in this 
regard, if supported by the record and not clearly 
erroneous, must stand on appeal. 
Id.  (quoting  In  re  Doe,  95  Hawai i  at  190,  20  P.3d  at  623).

            IV. DISCUSSION 
A. Jurisdiction 
This court has jurisdiction to review the October 9, 
2017 Order Denying Motion to Intervene and the December 21, 2017 
Order Denying Motion for Reconsideration. In substance, those 
orders related back to the July 31, 2017 Order Continuing 
Permanent Custody. 
HRS § 587A-36, which governs appeals of family court 
orders, provides: “[a]n interested party aggrieved by any order 
or decree of the court under this chapter may appeal as provided 
in section 571-54.” Under HRS § 571-54: 
An interested party, aggrieved by any order or decree 
of the court, may appeal to the intermediate appellate 
court for review of questions of law and fact upon the 
same terms and conditions as in other cases in the 
circuit court, and review shall be governed by chapter 
602, except as hereinafter provided. Where the decree 
or order affects the custody of a child or minor, the 
appeal shall be heard at the earliest practicable 
time. 
Chapter 602, in turn, gives this court jurisdiction 
“[t]o hear and determine all questions of law, or of mixed law 
and fact, which are properly brought before it by application for 
a writ of certiorari to the intermediate appellate court or by 
transfer as provided in this chapter.” HRS § 602-5(a)(1). 
KL did not timely appeal the family court’s orders 
granting and continuing permanent custody, entered on March 13, 
2017 and July 31, 2017. The ICA dismissed the appeal in part 
37           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
           
         
     
       
            
        
           
           
    
       
        
         
         
         
        
       
     
     
    
         
          
         
           
          
            
         
           
             
            
             
      because of this defect.30 But KL did timely appeal the family 
court’s decision on her Motion for Reconsideration of its order 
denying her Motion to Intervene.31 
Because the Motion for Reconsideration raised the same 
set of issues KL raised in her earlier opposition to the July 31, 
2017 Order Continuing Permanent Custody, we conclude that KL 
timely appealed the relevant issues from the July 31, 2017 Order. 
B. KL Had A Right to Intervene in the Case Under HFCR Rule 
24(a)(2) 
Pursuant to HFCR Rule 24(a)(2): 
Upon timely application anyone shall be permitted to 
intervene in an action when the applicant claims an 
interest relating to the . . . custody, visitation, or 
parental rights of a minor child which is the subject 
of the action and the applicant is so situated that 
the disposition of the action may as a practical 
matter impair or impede the applicant’s ability to 
protect that interest, unless the applicant[’]s 
interest is adequately represented by existing 
parties. 
HFCR Rule 24(a)(2) (emphasis added). 
Here, KL’s statement to the family court on July 13, 
2018 was sufficient to alert the court that she wished to 
intervene based on her interest in the custody, visitation, or 
parental rights of AB. Her interest was based on several aspects 
30 The ICA stated that an untimely appeal is “a jurisdictional defect 
that cannot be waived by the parties or disregarded by the court.” 
31 The family court entered its order denying KL’s Motion for 
Reconsideration on December 21, 2017; KL filed her notice of appeal on 
January 5, 2018. Pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(3), the timely filing of the 
Motion for Reconsideration extended the time for appeal of the October 9, 2017 
Order Denying Motion to Intervene until 30 days after the entry of the order 
disposing of the Motion for Reconsideration.

         of her role in AB’s life: a hānai relative currently raising  AB, 
the mother of AB’s half-sister, and AB’s resource caregiver, as 
well as being a petitioner to adopt AB. Taken together, these 
facts clearly show that KL’s interest was sufficient to allow her 
to intervene under HFCR Rule 24(a)(2). 
1. KL’s Motion to
 Intervene Did Not Need to Be in Writing 
The fact that KL did not move to intervene in writing, 
which the ICA found dispositive, is not relevant. First, HFCR 
Rule 24 requires only an “application,” not a motion. 
Consequently, HFCR Rule 10(a), which requires that all motions -
except when made during a hearing or trial - be in writing does 
not apply in its plain terms.32 Even if HFCR Rule 10(a) did 
apply to applications to intervene, KL requested an opportunity 
to notify the court of her interest in the proceeding during a 
hearing. Consequently, even if construed as a motion, rather 
than an application, this motion would be exempt from the writing 
requirement under HFCR Rule 10(a). 
2. The Family Court Should Have Construed KL’s Statement 
as a Motion to Intervene 
Although KL’s statement was not framed as an 
application to intervene in the proceedings, the family court 
should have construed it as such. At that time, KL was acting 
pro se. It is well settled that courts should avoid construing 
32 HFCR Rule 10(a) states, “All motions, except when made during a 
hearing or trial, shall be in writing, shall state the grounds therefor, shall 
set forth the relief or order sought, and if involving a question of law shall 
be accompanied by a memorandum in support of the motion.” 
39           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
       
  
      
        
        
        
        
           
          
          
        
          pro  se  pleadings  “technically”  in  a  way  that  forecloses  a  path  to 
relief  that  might  otherwise  be  available.   See  Waltrip  v.  TS 
Enters.,  Inc.,  140  Hawai i  226,  231,  389  P.3d  815,  820  (2016) 
(“[P]leadings  and  letters  in  administrative  proceedings  are  to  be 
construed  liberally  rather  than  technically.”  (citations  and 
alteration  omitted));  see  also  Ryan  v.  Herzog,  142  Hawai i  278, 
418  P.3d  619  (2018)  (“The  rules  do  not  require  technical 
exactness  or  draw  refined  inferences  against  the  pleader;  rather, 
they  require  a  determined  effort  to  understand  what  the  pleader 
is  attempting  to  set  forth  and  to  construe  the  pleading  in  his 
favor.”  (quoting  Dupree  v.  Hiraga,  121  Hawai i  297,  314,  219  P.3d 
1084,  1101  (2009))).   It  was  clear  from  the  substance  of  KL’s 
statement  that  she  was  asking  to  assert  her  interest  in  the 
proceeding.   The  family  court  should  have  recognized  that  and 
        construed KL’s statement as an application to intervene.
3. The Family Court Should Have
 Considered KL’s Hānai 
Status as A  Factor Weighing in Favor of Granting 
Intervention 
On appeal, the
 ICA correctly held that, given KL’s 
pending adoption petition, she had a sufficient interest to 
warrant intervention in the child welfare proceeding. However, 
it erred when it did not recognize that, in addition, by virtue 
of her status as the current resource caregiver, a hānai relativ e 
presently raising AB, and the mother of AB’s half-sister, KL had 
a right to intervene in the proceeding. 
In the
 aggregate, the roles KL played in AB’s life were 
40           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
        
       
 
      
      
         
         
        
   
        
      
  
            . . . sufficient  to  confer  a  right  to  intervene  in  the  child  welfare 
case.   When  determining  whether  a  person  has  asserted  an  interest 
sufficient  to  intervene  in  child  welfare  proceedings,  we  hold 
that  the  family  court  must  consider  any  asserted  hānai 
relationships  as  a  factor  weighing   in  favor  of  intervention.  
Hānai  relationships  are  rooted  in
  Native  Hawaiian 
culture: 
Meaning “to feed” or “to nourish,” hānai refers to a 
child who is
 reared, educated, and loved by someone 
other than the child’s natural parents. 
Traditionally, kūpuna and older siblings within the 
family exercised the right to hānai. The purpose of 
hānai was often to fill an emotional void for those 
without children in the home or to solidify a 
relationship between two families. 
Tr
aditionally,
  natural  parents   renounced  all  claims  to 
a  child  in  “a  binding  agreement  when  the  parents  said 
in  the  hearing  of  others,  ‘Nāu  ke  ke iki  kūkae  a 
na au,’”  meaning  “I  give  this  child,  intestines, 
contents  and  all.”   Thus,  the  permanent  quality  of  the 
hānai  relationship  made  it  a  near  equivalent  of  legal 
adoption.   It  is  important  to  note,  however,  that  the 
permanency  of  hānai  was  never  intended  to  sever  the 
child’s  genealogical  heritage. 
Native  Hawaiian  Law:  A  Treatise  1140-41  (Melody  Kapilialoha 
MacKenzie  with  Susan  K.  Serrano,  D.  Kapua ala  Sproat,  eds.,  2015) 
(citations  omitted). 
Several  statutes  define  and  incorporate  the  concept  of 
hānai  relationships   into  state  law.   The  term  is  defined  in  the 
Child  Protective  Act  as:
 
[A]n adult, other than a blood relative, whom the 
court or department has found by credible evidence to 
perform or to have performed a substantial role in the 
41           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
  
      
          
       
   upbrin
ging or material support of a child, as attested 
to by the written or oral designation of the child or 
of another person, including other relatives of the 
child. 
HRS § 587A-4. 
Hawai i’s  administrative  rules  governing  Temporary 
Assistance   of
  Needy  Families  defines  “relatives”  to  include  hānai 
mothers  and  fathers.   HAR  §  17-656.1-7(b)(1).   The  section 
includes  that  “‘[h]anai’  means  a  child  who  is  taken  permanently 
to  be  reared,  educated,  and  loved  by  someone  other  than  the 
child’s  natural  parents  at  the  time  of  the  child’s  birth  or  in 
early  childhood.   The  child  is  given  outright,  and  the  natural 
parents  renounce  all  claims  to  the  child.”   HAR  §  17-656.1-2.  
And  in  Hawai i’s  Workers   Compensation  Law,  the  term  “child” 
includes  “a  hanai  child  acknowledged  prior  to  the  personal 
injury.”   HRS  §  386-2.   This  section  does  not  define  the  term 
“hānai.” 33 
This  court  has  also  recognized  the  legal  significance 
of  hānai  relationships.
   In  Leong  v.  Takasaki,   55  Haw.  398,  520 
P.2d  758  (1974),  we  considered  whether  a  minor  child  could 
recover  damages  for  negligent  infliction  of  emotional  distress 
after  he  witnessed  his  hānai  grandmother  killed  in   a  car 
33 Many  other  administrative  rules  also  recognize  hānai 
relationships.   See,  e.g.,  H AR  §§  17-2030-2  (Hawai i  Public  Housing  Authority 
administrative  rules  defining  hānai  child  as  “a  person,  under  nineteen  years 
of  age,  for  whom  an  applicant  provides  food,  nourishment,  and  support  and  who 
is  known  among  friends,  relatives,  and  the  community  as  the  applicant’s 
child”);  17-656.1-15(c)(3)  (Aid  to  Families  with  Dependent  Children  rule  that 
“[t]he  needs  and  income  of  hanai  parents  must  be  included  in  assistance  units 
which  include  a  hanai  child”).

           accident. We found that the absence of a blood relationship did 
not bar the child’s recovery, citing the strong Native Hawaiian 
tradition of hānai.34 55 Haw. at 410-11, 520 P.2d at 766. Our 
holding that the family court must weigh hānai relationships in 
favor of granting intervention in a
 child welfare proceeding 
recognizes the emotional bond between hānai parent and child. 
This bond confers an interest on behalf of the parent in the life 
of the child, even without formal adoption. 
C. The Family Court Erred
 When it Failed to Examine the Best 
Interests of the Child Before Ordering Out of State 
Placement 
1. DHS Has Broad Discretion to Recommend In-State 
Placement of Foster Children 
“[U]pon  termination  of  parental  rights,  discretion  to  
determine  an  appropriate  custodian  is  vested  in  DHS.”   In  re  Doe 
(December  2002  Doe),  100  Hawai i  335,  346,  60  P.3d  285,  296 
(2002).
   One  of  the  statutory  “duties  and  rights”  of  DHS,  as 
permanent  custodian,  is  “[d]etermining  where  and  with  whom  the 
child  shall  live;  provided  that  the  child  shall  not  be  placed 
outside  the  State  without  prior  order  of  the  court[.]”   HRS 
§  587A-15(d)(2).   When  DHS  recommends  an  in-state  placement,  we 
have  recognized  that  DHS  “must  necessarily  be  free  as  an  agency, 
with  its  particular  expertise  in  child  welfare,  to  make  choices 
among  living  arrangements[.]”   In  re  AS,  132  Hawai i  368,  378, 
34 At the same time, this court has stopped short of using the 
doctrine of equitable adoption to make hānai children heirs of the ir hānai 
parents. Maui Land & Pineapple Co. v. Naiapaakai Heirs of Makeelani, 69 Haw. 
565, 568, 751 P.2d 1020, 1021-22 (1988). Our decision today follows Leong but 
does
 not disturb the holding in Maui Land & Pineapple .

  2. The Family Court’s Best Interests of the Child 
Determination Limits DHS’s Discretion Where DHS 
Recommends Out-Of-State Placement 
     
         
        
       
             
          
           
          322 P.3d 263, 273 (2014). 
In  defining  the  parameters  of   the  family  court’s  review 
of  an  in-state  placement  decision,  we  found  that  “where  a  party 
challenges  DHS’s  permanent  placement  determination,  that  party 
bears  the  burden  of  proving,  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence, 
that  DHS’s  permanent  placement  determination  is  not  in  the  best 
interests  of  the  child.”   Id.  at  377.   We  set  forth  this  rule 
because  DHS’s  “social  workers  are  presumed  to  be  experts  on  child 
protection  and  child  welfare.”   Id.  (citing  HRS  §  326-51  (1993  & 
Supp.  2008),  and  HRS  §  587A-19  (Supp.  2010)).   Under  this 
standard,  DHS’s  in-state  permanent  placement  recommendation  will 
be  upheld  unless  “the  party  contesting  DHS’s  permanent  placement 
recommendation”  establishes  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence 
that  the  recommended  placement  is  not  in  the  child’s  best 
interests.   Id. 
Where DHS recommends an out-of-state
 permanent 
placement, “the child shall not be placed outside the State 
without prior order of the court,” HRS § 587A-15(d)(2), 
regardless of whether this placement recommendation is contested 
by another party. In In re AS, we held that the family court 
must make its own best interests determination in the context of 
permanency hearings. 132 Hawai i at 377, 322  P.3d at 272. 
Similarly, in AB’s case, the family court had an obligation in 
44           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
     
       
  
         
          
        
          
         
         
     
         
       
  
        
          
        
  
   
        
       
          
   
    
        
          
         
        
       
         
          
            
          all instances involving out-of-state permanent placement 
recommendations to conduct an independent determination of the 
child’s best interests. 
The family court did not conduct such a determination. 
At the July 13, 2017 hearing, the court accepted, without any 
serious inquiry into AB’s best interests, the recommendation to 
change AB’s placement to New Hampshire.35 The extent of the 
court’s inquiry is reflected in the transcript between the court, 
the GAL, and Deputy Attorney General Sandra Freitas, appearing on 
behalf of the Department, as follows: 
THE  COURT: Thank you. Good morning. Please have a 
seat, everyone. So, Miss Iopa, this is a status 
hearing on your motion. Where are we at? 
MS.  IOPA: Yes, Your Honor. I believe we have an 
agreement for a change of placement and to continue 
the adoption hearing. 
THE  COURT: Ms. Freitas? 
MS.  FREITAS: That is correct, Your Honor. The 
Department is going to be changing the placement 
of the child to [SH and JH’s] home on the mainland. 
THE  COURT: All right. 
MS.  FREITAS: She's been there. 
THE  COURT: And that's where she is at now? 
MS.  FREITAS: Things have been going well. Yes. And 
the ICPC already went through approving that home. So 
effective today, we're going to be having the status 
changed, so that will be the resource home. 
35 It is also unclear whether the family court considered this 
court’s holding that “there is no relative placement preference in [HRS] 
chapter 587A [] with respect to permanent placement of foster children[.]” In 
re AS, 132 Hawai i at 3 70, 322 P.3d at 265. 
45           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
       
 
        TH
E  COURT:   All  right. 
The  family  court  did  not  inquire  into  DHS’s  abrupt 
change  of  position  in  favor  of  SH.   It  did  not  ask  the  GAL  what 
AB’s  position  was  with  regard  to  her  permanent  placement.   It  did 
not  consider  how  this  change  of  placement  would  impact  AB’s 
relationships  in  Hawai i,  or  how  it  would  impact   AB’s  interests 
in  stability.   It  did  not  ask  why  possible  permanent  placement 
options  in  Hawai i,  including  her  present  placement  at  the  time, 
were  no  longer  being  considered.   The  court  simply  said,  “All 
right”  and  moved  on.   Considering  the  record  before  the  family 
court  at  that  time,  and  considering  the  family  court’s  statutory 
obligation  to  review  the  DHS’s  out-of-state  placement  decision, 
this  was  an  abuse  of  discretion. 
We  have  recognized  that  “[w]here   the  best  interests  of 
a  child  is  of  paramount  importance,  consideration  of  all  relevant 
evidence  becomes  a  critical  duty  of  the  court  in  making  a 
decision  regarding  custody  and  visitation.”   In  re  Doe  (2006 
Doe),  109  Hawai i  399,  411,  126  P.3d   1086,  1098  (2006)  (citations 
omitted).   As  such,  we  held  that  the  family  court  abused  its 
discretion  when  it  denied  appellants  “the  opportunity  to  present 
evidence  to  show  that  visitation  was  in  the  best  interest  of  the 
children,”  and  we  ordered  that  the  appellants  be  provided  this 
opportunity  on  remand.   Id.  
KL likewise was wrongfully denied
 the opportunity to 
present evidence to the family court regarding AB’s placement. 
46           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
          
          
       
        
            
            
          
          
        
   
        
         
          
      
        
           
       
       
         
          
       
         
        
        The court allowed KL’s statement at the July 2017 hearing, not 
because of her interests in AB’s custody, but because of her 
statutory right, as the current resource caregiver, to 
“participate in the proceedings to provide information to the 
court . . . concerning the current status of the child in [her] 
care.” See HRS § 587A-14. The opportunity to read a statement 
aloud does not satisfy the 2006 Doe requirement. Rather, KL 
should have been able to participate as a party and thereby 
present evidence and otherwise develop an adequate factual record 
for the court’s consideration. 
Moreover, there is no indication that the family court 
considered KL’s statement when issuing its decision. Aside from 
stating, “Thanks for that input,” the court did not address KL’s 
assertions, acknowledge the dispute regarding whether AB’s 
proposed out-of-state placement was in her best interests, or 
even state a finding that such a change was in AB’s best 
interests. 
3. The Family Court Should Have Considered AB’s Hānai 
Relationship
 with KL When it Determined AB’s Best 
Interests 
HRS §
 571-46(b) sets forth the factors involved in a 
best interests of the child analysis in the context of child 
custody and visitation determinations in divorce proceedings. 
Among these are “[t]he emotional needs of the child,” “[t]he 
child’s need for relationships with siblings,” and “[t]he overall 
quality of the parent-child relationship.” In addition, “[o]ther 
47           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
        
 
        
         
         
       
          
          
        
       
         
          
       
          
           
          
             
           
           
           
               factors  for  consideration  may  include  the  child’s  own  desires  and 
his  [or  her]  emotional  and  physical  needs.”   In  re  Doe,  95 
Hawai i  at  191,  20  P.3d  at   624  (quoting  Woodruff  v.  Keale,  64 
Haw.  85,  99-100,  637  P.2d  760,  769-70  (1981)).   Hānai 
relationships  fit  within  these  categories  that  the  family  court 
must  consider  in  determining  a  child’s  best  interests. 
Given the significance of the hānai
 relationship in our 
statutes, prior
 case law, and Native Hawaiian history, as stated 
above, such relationships are an essential part of the best 
interests of the child determination. Consequently, we hold that 
family courts must consider these relationships whenever the 
statute requires that the court determine the best interests of a 
child. Because the family court did not consider AB’s hānai 
relationships, including her
 relationship with KL, it abused its 
discretion in changing AB’s placement to New Hampshire.36 
Because we find that KL was entitled to intervene in 
the proceedings under HFCR Rule 24(a) and that the family court 
inadequately considered AB’s best interests in changing her 
placement on July 13, 2017, we need not reach the constitutional 
question posed in KL’s first point of error on certiorari. In 
addition, we do not determine here whether the family court erred 
in its Findings of Fact on March 13, 2017 - this question is moot 
because the family court must now make new findings of AB’s best 
36 It also does not appear that the family court took into account 
HRS § 571-46(b)(10)’s mandate to consider AB’s “need for [a] relationship with 
her sibling[],” TL, who also resided with KL while AB was in KL’s home.

V. CONCLUSION 
For  the  reasons   set  forth  above,  and  consistent  with 
our  June  28,  2019  Order,  we  vacate  the  January  31,  2019  judgment
of  the  ICA  and  the  July  31,  2017  order  of  the  family  court  and 
remand  for  further  proceedings  consistent  with  this  opinion.

37 We also need not decide whether KL qualified as a person with “de 
facto custody” of AB pursuant to HRS § 571-46(a)(2). Should the family court 
determine that KL had de facto custody of AB, that status may confer 
additional rights in the pending adoption proceeding.
