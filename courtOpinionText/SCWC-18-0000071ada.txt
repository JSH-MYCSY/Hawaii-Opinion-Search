 I.  Introduction  
 
 This certiorari proceeding arises out of an appeal from a 
foreclosure judgment.  In their certiorari application, Terrence 
Ryan (“Terrence ”) and Lucille Ryan ( “Lucille”) (collectively, 
“the Ryans ”) present the following question:  
 Did the Intermediate Court of Appeals ( “ICA”) commit 
grave errors of law and/or fail to reconcile obvious 
inconsistencies in its decision with those of the Hawaii 
Supreme Court when the ICA concluded that the Circuit Court 
did not abuse its discretion by denying the moving party ’s 
motion to extend time to file notice of appeal where the 
moving party affirmatively inquired directly with the 
Circuit Court a bout when the order was filed, and the 
Circuit Court staff provided incorrect information to the 
moving party leading the moving party to believe that the 
thirty days to file the notice of appeal had not yet begun 
tolling?  
 
 We hold as follows:  (1) Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure 
(“HRAP”) Rule 4(a)(4)(B)1 motions to extend time for filing a 
notice of appeal are not properly filed as ex parte motions ; (2) 
the Rules of the Circuit Courts of the State of Hawaiʻi (“RCCH”) 
 
1  HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B) provides as follows:  
 
(4)  Extensions of Time to File the Notice of Appeal . 
 
. . . . 
 
(B) Requests for Extensions of Time After Expiration 
of the Prescribed Time .  The court or agency appealed 
from, upon a showing of excusable neglect,  may extend 
the time for filing the notice of appeal upon motion 
filed not later than 30 days after the expiration of 
the time prescribed by subsections (a)(1) through 
(a)(3) of this Rule.   However, no such extension 
shall exceed 30 days past the prescribe d time.  
Notice of an extension motion filed after the 
expiration of the prescribed time shall be given to 
the other parties in accordance with the rules of the 
court . . . appealed from.  ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
3 
 Rule 7.2(g)(5)(A)2 provision  purportedly disallowing appellate 
review of decisions on m otions to advance  hearings is 
inapplicable to decisions on HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B)  motions, 
pursuant to HRAP Rule 2.1(a)  (2010); (3) under the circumstances 
of this case, the Ryans’ motion to advance the hearing on the ir 
February 2, 2018 HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B) h earing motion should have 
been granted ; (4) the Ryans established  “excusable neglect ,” and 
their HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B) hearing motion  should have been 
granted; and (5 ) thus, the Ryans ’ February 6, 2018 notice of 
appeal was effective  as to all issues on appeal over which the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals ( “ICA”) has appellate jurisdiction  
based on the Ryans ’ timely appeal of the December 8, 2017 or der 
denying reconsideration of  the order granting summary judgment 
and foreclosure judgment .3  
 
2  RCCH Rule 7.2(g)(5)(A) provides in relevant part as follows:  
 
(5) Motion to Shorten Time for, Advance, or Reschedule 
Hearing.   
 
      (A) A motion to shorten time for hearing or motion to 
 advance hearing shall . . .  cite the authority and 
 state the reason(s) and factual or other basis for 
 the request.   . . . .  The assigned judge may grant 
 or deny the motion, and such grant or denial shall 
 not be subject to review or reconsideration.  . . . . 
 
3  See text accompanying infra note 18.  With respect to the February 6, 
2018 notice of appeal in CAAP -18-0000071, this opinion only addresses the 
procedural rulings, issues (4) and (5), over which the ICA ruled appellate 
jurisdiction existed.  We express no opinion on the merits of th e remaining 
issues.  We also address the issues raised in CAAP -18-0000312 and CAAP -18-
0000388, as explained below.  Only issues (1) to (3) in CAAP -18-0000071, 
however, remain for consideration by the ICA on remand.  Id. ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***

  We therefore vacate the ICA ’s May 7, 2020 judgment on 
appeal and remand this case to the ICA for further proceedings 
consistent with this opinion.  
II. Background    
A. Factual background  
 On or about February 20, 2009, the Ryans  executed a 
promissory note in the principal amount of $625,000 in favor of 
Bank of Am erica, N.A. ( “Bank of America ”).  To secure payment , 
the Ryans executed a mortgage encumbering real property located  
in Kalāheo, Hawaiʻi.  The Ryans  apparently failed to make timely 
payments  then failed to cure the default despite Bank of 
America’s written notice regarding its intent to accelerate the 
loan and to foreclose .   
B. Procedural background  
 1. Circuit court proceedings  
  a. Complaint, foreclosure judgment  
 On October 30, 2012, Bank of America filed a foreclosure 
complaint against the Ryans in the Circuit Court of the Fifth 
Circuit ( “circuit court ”).4  Between November 7, 2012, and April 
1, 2013, Bank of America att empted to personally serve the Ryans 
with the complaint in Kalāheo and in Washington State.  After 
the circuit court authorized service by certified mail, Terrence 
 
4  The Honorable Kathleen N.A. Watan abe presided.  ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
5 (continued. . .)  
 was served on March 13, 2015 , and Lucille was served on March 
19, 2015, at different locations within Washington  State. 
 On March 23, 2015, the Ryans filed a pro se motion for a 
120-day extension of time to respond to the complaint  (“answer 
extension motion”) .  On April 7, 2015, the circuit court legal 
documents branch informed  the Ryans that the motion was 
deficient because it did not include a case type in the caption, 
was filed without a case type and /or case number, and there was 
no order submitted at  the time of filing.   That same day, the 
Ryans responded to the memorandum, providing a case type and a 
case number, but did not include an order.  
 Through several assignments and orders of substitution 
starting on May 9, 2013, Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, 
D/B/A Chris tiana Trust, Not Individually but as Trustee for 
Pretium Mortgage Acquisition Trust ( “Wilmington ”), substituted 
as plaintiff  effective December 22, 2016 .   
 On April 27, 2017, at Wilmington ’s request , the circuit 
court clerk entered default s against the Ryans for their failure 
to plead or otherwi se defend.5  Then, on June 21, 2017, 
Wilmington filed a summary judgment motion  for foreclosure .  
 
5  Hawaiʻi Rules of Civil Procedure  (“HRCP”) Rule 55 (2000) states in 
relevant part:  
 
(a) Entry.   When a party against whom a judgment for 
affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead or 
otherwise defend as provided by these rules and tha t fact ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
6 
  On July 21, 2017, despite the April 27 , 2017 entry of 
default, the circuit court filed an order granting the Ryans ’ 
March 23, 2015 answer extension motion,  but which stated: “THIS 
MATTER is before the court upon [the Ryans ’] Motion for an 
Extension of Time to Answer Plaintiff ’s Complaint for an 
additional 120 days (July 21, 2015) from the date of fil ing of 
this motion. ”6   
 On August 31, 2017, the Ryans, now represented by counsel, 
filed a memorandum in opposition  to the summary judgment motion 
for foreclosure .  
 At the September 5, 2017  hearing on the summary judgment 
motion, the circuit court  noted the April 27 , 2017 entry of 
default and granted Wilmington ’s motion.  On September 20 , 2017, 
the circuit court entered its findings of fa ct, conclusions of 
(. . .continued) 
is made to appear by affidavit or otherwise, the clerk 
shall enter the party’s default.  
 
6  In a letter dated July 21, 2017, Janis N. Efhan, the Courts Documents 
Supervisor, apologized to the Ryans for the delay in processing the answer 
extension mo tion, explaining:  
 
 Our office recently re -sent this document to the 
judge for review and signature.  Since no copies were 
provided with your order, we are providing you 2 courtesy 
certified copies.  Please assure, you serve opposing party 
said document t o assure they are aware of the decision of 
the court.  When submitting documents in the future, please 
provide original and copies enough for serving opposing 
party(ies) and your records.  
 Lastly an apology for delay in the processing of 
document.  This do cument was provided to the court for 
review and signature when it was first sent.  For 
unforeseen reasons, the[] document was not acted upon in a 
timely manner.   ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***

 law, and order granting summary judgment  (“foreclosure order ”), 
as well as its foreclosure j udgment.   
  b. Motion for reconsideration  
 
 On September 29, 20 17, the Ryans moved  for reconsideration  
of the foreclosure order  and judgment  (“foreclosure 
reconsideration motion ”).  The Ryans requested an opportunity to 
answer the complaint and to be reheard on the summary judgment  
motion.  On October 9, 2017, Wilmington  responded , arguing the 
Ryans failed to set forth any basis for setting aside the entry 
of default or the grant of summary jud gment.  
  c. Denial of reconsideration motion  
 On October 20, 2017, the circuit court ’s law clerk ema iled 
the parties ’ counsel, stating: “Based on your respective 
pleadings, arguments, and authorities cited, the court is 
DENYING [the f oreclosure  reconsideration motion].  The court 
requests that [Wilmington ’s counsel] prepare the order and 
submit it within two (2) weeks. ”    
 On November 9, 2017, Wilmington ’s counsel  emailed and 
mailed the proposed order denying the foreclosure  
reconsideration mot ion to the Ryans ’ counsel.  On November 13, 
2017, the circuit  court’s judicial assistant emailed 
Wilmington ’s counsel  asking for a st atus update regarding the 
order.  Wilmington ’s counsel responded that the proposed order 
had been sent to the Ryans ’ counsel but that it would be ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***

 submitted to the circuit court in accordance with RCCH Rule 23 
(2010)7 if the Ryans ’ counsel did not approve it as to form.   On 
November 20, 2017, Wilmington filed a RCCH Rule 23 notice of 
submission of the  proposed  order with a certificate of service 
on the Ryans ’ counsel.  In the certificate of service, 
Wilmington ’s counsel expressly stated, “The undersigned hereby 
certifies a copy of the foregoing Order will be duly served upon 
the below parties at their respectiv e addresses by U.S. Mail, 
postage prepaid, when filed copies are received by this 
office[.]” 
 
7  RCCH Rule 23(b) provides:  
 
(b) Party Approval or Objection to Form; Delivery to Court.   
If there is no objection to the form of a proposed 
judgment, decree, or order, the other parties shall 
promptly approve as to form.  If a proposed judgment, 
decree, or order is not approved as to form by the other 
parties within 5 days after a written re quest for approval, 
the drafting party shall deliver, by filing conventionally 
or electronically, the original and 1 copy to the court 
along with notice of service on all parties and serve a 
copy thereof upon each party who has appeared in the 
action.  If any party objects to the form of a proposed 
judgment, decree, or order, that party shall, within 5 days 
after service of the proposed judgment, decree, or order, 
serve upon each party who has appeared in the action and 
deliver to the court, either conventi onally or through 
electronic filing:  
 
      (1) A statement of objections and the reasons 
therefor, and  
 
      (2) The form of the objecting party’s proposed 
judgment, decree, or order.  
 
      In such event, the court shall proceed to settle the 
judgment, decree, or order.  Failure to file and serve 
objections and a proposed judgment, decree, or order shall 
constitute approval as to form of the drafting party’s 
proposed judgment, decree, o r order.  ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
9 . . . . 
  The circuit court filed  its order denying  the foreclosure 
reconsideration  motion (“order denying foreclosure 
reconsideration”)  on December 8, 2017 .  Despite the previous 
certification from Wilmington ’s counsel , as well as the Hawaiʻi 
Rules of Civil Procedure (“HRCP”) Rule 5 (2000) requirement of 
service of “[e]very order required by its terms to be served, ” 
Wilmington did not serve a file -stamped copy of the December 8, 
2017 order denying  foreclosure  reconsideration on the Ryans ’ 
counsel until February 26, 2018.   
  d. Ryans’ attempts to extend time to appeal   
 Based on the December 8, 2017 filing of the order, the 
initial thirty -day deadline for filing a notice of appeal8 or a 
 
8  HRAP Rule s 4(a)(1) and (3) provide in relevant part:  
 
Rule 4.  Appeals -- When Taken. 
 
 (a) Appeals in civil cases . 
 
      (1) Time for filing .  When a civil appeal is 
permitted by law, the notice of appeal shall be filed 
within 30 days after entry of the judgment or appealable 
order. 
 . . . . 
 (3) Time to appeal affected by post -judgment 
motions.  If any party files a timely motion . . . to 
reconsider, alter  or amend the judgment or order, . . .  
then the time for filing the notice of appeal is extended 
for all parties until 30 days after entry of an order 
disposing of the motion. . . . . 
      The notice of appeal shall be deemed to appeal the 
disposition of all post -judgment motions that are tim ely 
filed after entry of the judgment or order.  
 
 ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
10 
 HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(A)9 motion to extend time for filing an appeal 
was to expire  on January 8 , 2018.  The Ryans did not file a 
notice of appeal or a HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(A)  motion by January 8, 
2018.  
 After the initial thirty -day deadline for filing a notice 
of appeal  expires, HRAP Rule 4(A)(4)(B)  allows a party to file a 
motion to extend the deadline for another thirty days based on 
“excusable neglect. ”10  For the Ryans, this  second thirty days 
for filing a motion to extend based on “excusable neglect ” began 
on January 9, 2018,  and was to end on February 7 , 2018, which 
was also the deadline  for filing a notice of appeal if a thirty -
day extension was granted pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B) .    
 On January 26, 2018, the Ryans submitted an ex parte  motion 
for a thirty -day extension  to file a notice of appeal  (“ex parte 
extension motion ”), citing HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B)  and RCCH Rule 
 
9  HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(A) provides:  
 
(4)  Extensions of Time to File the Notice of Appeal . 
 
(A) Requests for Extensions of Time Before Expiration 
of the Prescribed Time .  The court or agency  appealed 
from, upon a showing of good cause, may extend the 
time for filing a notice of appeal upon motion filed 
within the time prescribed by subsections (a)(1) 
through (a)(3) of this Rule.   However, no such 
extension shall exceed 30  days past such prescribed 
time.  An extension motion that is filed before the 
expiration of the prescribed time may be ex parte 
unless the court . . . otherwise requires.  
 
10  See supra note 1. ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
11 
 7.2(f) (2014).11  They contended the appeal deadline should be 
extended for thirty days beyond the initial thirty -day deadline 
because they did not discover until January 25, 2018 , that the 
order denying foreclosure reconsideration had been filed on 
December 8, 2017.  
Attached to th e Ryans’ ex parte  extension  motion were  
declaration s from attorney Matthew K. Yoshi da (“Yoshida”) and 
legal assistant Jessica Taiatini ( “Taiatini ”).  Yoshida and 
Taiatini averred under penalty of perjury as follows.  After 
being informed that the circuit court would be denying  the 
foreclosure  reconsideration  motion, they checked Hoʻohiki12 
approximately once per week fo r the status of the order .  They 
did not notice any change to Hoʻohiki “for some time, ” so, on 
 
11  RCCH Rule 7.2(f) provides:  
 
(f) Ex parte  motions.   A motion entitled to be heard  ex 
parte shall: 
 
      (1)  cite the statute, rule, or other authority 
authorizing the court to entertain the motion ex parte ; 
      (2) be supported by  an affidavit or declaration 
stating the reason(s) for filing the motion  ex parte, the 
efforts made  to notify parties, and, if the motion is to 
shorten time or advance a hearing pursuant to subsection 
(g)(5) of this Rule, the efforts made to obtain a 
stipulation or response from the other parties in the case 
or the re ason(s) why n o attempt was made;  
 (3)  be accompanied by a proposed order; and  
 (4)  be served on the date that the motion was 
presented to the court.  
 
12  Until circuit court civil cases were migrated into the eCourt K okua on-
line filing system effective October 28, 20 19, the Hoʻohiki system provided 
online access to information in circuit court civil cases, such as documents 
filed, proceedings scheduled, and minutes of past proceedings.  ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
12 (continued. . .)  
 January 2, 2018, Taiatini called the circuit court ’s chambers to 
ask about the status of the order .  A member of the circuit 
court staff told Taiatini that “the order was not entered, that 
the order might be on [the judge ’s] desk, that [the judge]  was 
out at the time, and that they will follow up on the following 
Monday.”  On January 25, 2 018, however,  the Ryans noticed a new 
entry in Hoʻohiki indicating  an order denyin g the foreclosure  
reconsideration motion  had been filed on December 8, 2017.  
Relying on the information provided by a  circuit court staff 
member over the phone on January 2, 2018,  however, they had 
believed the order  had not been filed as of  that date .   
 Although the January 26, 2018 motion was filed ex parte, a 
certificate of service was attached  as required by RCCH Rule 
7.2(f)(4) ,13 certifying that a copy of the motion was being 
mailed to Wilmington ’s counsel.  It appears Wilmington ’s counsel 
received the motion because a memorandum in opposition was filed 
on January 3 0, 2018.  
 In its memorandum in opposit ion, Wilmington maintained the 
Ryans’ reliance upon the circuit court staff ’s representations 
did not constitute “excusable neglect, ” citing to Bank of Hawaii 
v. Shaw, 83 Hawaiʻi 50, 924 P.2d 544 (App. 1996).14  Wilmington 
 
13  See supra note 11.  
 
14  In Shaw, the appellant missed the ten -day jury demand dea dline under 
the District Court Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 38(b), and argued that his ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
13 
 also contended t he Ryans failed to address Wilmington ’s alleged 
service of the December 8, 2017 or der denying foreclosure 
reconsideration .15  Wilmington also argued the Ryans did not 
explain why they failed to follow up with Wilmington  regarding 
the filing status of the order.   
 Wilmington also maintained  the motion was procedurally 
improper because HRAP Rule 4 (a)(4)(B)  required t he Ryans to give 
Wilmington notice  and that the Ryans ’ failure to do so violated  
RCCH Rule 7.2(f)(2).16  Wilmington ’s counsel ’s declaration 
indicated counsel was not informed of the Ryans ’ intent to file 
the ex parte motion.  
 On January 31, 2018 , the circuit court filed the order 
denying the January 26, 2018 motion ( “order denying ex parte  
extension motion ”).    
(. . .continued) 
reliance on a clerk’s statement who told him that he had fourteen days to 
file his demand for a jury trial excused his failure to file within the 
deadline.  83 Hawaiʻi at 57, 924 P.2d at 551.  The ICA held that “[w]ithout 
the support of an adequate ‘excuse,’ [the appellant’s] actions amounted to 
‘mere inadvertence or bare oversight’ which, under Lii[ v. Sida of Hawaii, 
Inc., 53 Haw. 353, 53 Haw. 372, 493 P.2d 1032 (1972) ], were declared 
insufficient grounds for a court to exercise its discretion to grant a jury 
trial.”  Id.  Shaw is obviously distinguishable as the alleged representation 
by the court clerk was one of law, which counsel had the duty and opportunity 
to independently ascertain.  This case involves a representation of fact, and 
we discuss Shaw no further.  
 
15  As noted, the record indicates Wilmington did not serve a file -stamped 
copy of the December 8, 2017 order denying foreclosure reconsideration until 
February 26, 2018.   
 
16  See supra note 11.   ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
14 
  After this  denial, through an ex officio filing with the 
clerk of the appellate courts  on February 2, 2018 , the Ryans 
filed a motion for extension of time to file a notice of appeal  
as a hearing motion  (“appeal extension motion ”).  This motion 
raised the same arguments and attached declarations as did the 
January 26, 2018 ex parte  motion.  The motion was stamped 
received by the circuit court on February 5, 2018, two days 
before the deadline  for filing a HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B) motion and 
the appeal if the motion was granted .  
 Along with the appeal extension motion , the Ryans also 
submitted  an ex parte motion to advance its  hearing date 
(“motion to advance”) , noting that a motion heard in the n ormal 
course would be ineffective.  This motion was stamped “DENIED” 
and filed by the circuit court on February 6, 2018  (“order 
denying motion to advance ”).  After this denial, on February 9, 
2018, a notice for hearing the appeal extension motion was 
filed, scheduling the hearing for March 6, 2018.  
 On February 2, 2018, the same day the Ryans filed the 
appeal extension motion as a hearing motion, the Ryans also 
filed a motion seeking reconsideration of the January 31, 2018 
order denying ex parte  extension motion ( “reconsideration motion 
of ex parte appeal denial ”), raising the same arguments made in 
their ex parte extension motion.  In this motion, the Ryans also 
cited to King v. Elkayam , CAAP-16-0000209, 2016 WL 3762628, at ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
15 
 *7 (App. July 13, 2016)  (order), which had noted that 
“[appellants ] presented no reason for their fa ilure, for 
example, to send a messenger to court to look up the relevant 
date, and we see no ‘forces beyond their control, ’ -- at least 
on this record  —- that prevented them from taking this eminently 
reasonable step. ”  (Alteration in original.)   The Ryans  argued 
that, in contrast, they took the “eminently reasonable step ” of 
contacting the circuit court directly, but were provided 
incorrect information by circuit court staff.17    
 On February 6, 2018, despite the circuit court ’s denials of 
their January 26,  2018 extension  motion and their motion to 
advance the hearing date on  their February 2, 2018 hearing 
motion, the Ryans proceeded to file a notice of appeal , in CAAP -
18-0000071.  In this notice of appeal, t he Ryans purported to 
appeal the circuit court ’s (1) September 20, 2017 foreclosure 
order; (2) September 20, 201 7 foreclosure judgment; (2) December 
8, 2017 order den ying foreclosure  reconsideration; (4) January 
 
17  The Ryans also contended  the circuit court had delayed its order 
granting the answer extension motion for more than two years without 
providing any explanation or reason for the delay.  They also noted that 
despite the circuit court instructing  Wilmington to “prepare the order an d 
submit it within two (2) weeks[,]” Wilmington did not submit  a proposed order 
to them for approval for three weeks or the proposed order to the circuit 
court for four weeks.   As such, the Ryans maintained the denial of their 
motion would be treating them  more harshly than the circuit court treated 
itself and Wilmington.   ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***

 31, 2018 order denying ex parte  extension motion; and (5) 
February 6, 2018 order denying motion to adv ance.18   
 On February 12, 2018, Wilmington filed an opposition to  the 
Ryans’ February 2, 2018 reconsideration motion of ex parte 
appeal denial.   Citing to HRAP Rule 4(a)(3),19 Wilmington 
asserted  that because the Ryans filed their foreclosure 
reconsideration motion on September 29, 2017, (1) the circuit 
court had ninety days, or until  December 28, 2017, to enter an 
order disposing of the foreclos ure reconsideration motion , and 
 
18  With respect to the February 6, 2018 appeal in CAAP -18-0000071, this 
opinion only addresses the procedural issues in (4) and (5) over which the 
ICA ruled it had appellate jurisdiction .   
 
19  HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) now provides in its entirety as follows:  
  
(3) Time to appeal affected by post-judgment motions.  If 
any party files a timely motion for judgment as a matter of 
law, to amend findings or make additional findings, for a 
new trial, to reconsider, alter or amend the judgment or 
order, or for attorney ’s fees or costs, and court or agency 
rules specify the time by which the motion shall be filed, 
then the time for filing the notice of appeal is extended 
for all parties until 30 d ays after entry of an order 
disposing of the motion.  The presiding court or agency in 
which the motion was filed shall dispose of any such post -
judgment motion by entering an order upon the record within 
90 days after the date the motion was filed.  If the court 
or agency fails to enter an order on the record, then, 
within 5 days after the 90th day, the clerk of the relevant 
court or agency shall notify the parties that, by operation 
of this Rule, the post -judgment motion is denied and that 
any orders ente red thereafter shall be a nullity.   The time 
of appeal shall run from the date of entry of the court or 
agency’s order disposing of the post -judgment motion, if 
the order is entered within the 90 days, or from the filing 
date of the clerk ’s notice to the p arties that the post -
judgment motion is denied pursuant to the operation of the 
Rule. 
      The notice of appeal shall be deemed to appeal the 
disposition of all post -judgment motions that are timely 
filed after entry of the judgment or order.  
      The 90-day period shall be computed as provided in 
Rule 26 of these Rules.  ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***

 (2) the circuit court clerk had five days after December 28, 
2017, which would have been January 2, 2018, to notify the 
parties that the foreclosure reconsideration motion was denied.   
Wilmington argued that the Ryans ’ assertion that they reasonably 
relied on the circuit court staff ’s representation on January 2, 
2018, was flawed becaus e if the circuit co urt did not enter the 
order by December 28, 2017, the foreclosure reconsideration 
motion would have been deemed denied  and the circuit court clerk 
would have had to notify the parties that the motion was denied  
by January 2, 2018 .  Wilmington argued that if the Ryans had 
properly monitored their calendar, they would have noticed the 
ninetieth day had passed and the appeal deadline would begin.20    
 On February 26, 2018, Wilmington also filed an opposition 
to the February 2, 2018 appeal extension motion, reasserting the 
arguments it previously made.  Wilmington also argued the Ryans 
failed to take reasonable steps to  keep inf ormed of the status 
of the December 8, 2017 order as they only called  the circuit 
court once between October 20, 2017, when the circuit court 
informed the parties of the denial of the foreclosure 
reconsideration motion, and January 25, 2018, the d ate the Ryans 
asserted they learned of the filing of the December 8, 2017 
 
20  However, there was no January 2, 2018 appeal deadline triggering 
notification from the circuit court clerk pursuant to  HRAP Rule 4(a)(3), 
supra note 19, because the appeal filing deadline had already been triggered 
by the December 8, 2017 order denying motion for foreclosure reconsideration.   ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
18 
 order.  Further, Wilmington note d the Ryans did not allege they 
tried to contact Wilmington ’s counsel or the circu it court a 
second time, or ask  a messenger to check the circuit cour t’s 
file to determine the status of the order.  Wilmington thus 
maintained a single phone call in thre e months did not 
constitute “eminently reasonable step s” justifying an extension 
to file a notice of appeal.     
 On March 8, 2018, the circuit court filed its order denying 
reconsideration  motion of ex parte appeal.  On April 6, 2018, 
the Ryans filed their second notice of appeal, in CAAP -18-
0000312, from the March 8, 20 18 order.   
 At the March 6, 2018 hearing on the  February 2, 2018 appeal 
extension motion, the parties rested on their written 
submissions, and the circuit court orally denied the motion.   On 
April 5, 2018, the circuit court entered its order denying this  
motion.  On May 4, 2018, the Ryans filed their third notice of 
appeal, in CAAP-18-0000388, from the  April 5, 2018 order.   
 2. ICA proceedings  
 On August 13, 2018 , the ICA consolidated  the three appeals.   
  a. Opening brief  
 In their opening brief, in summary, the Ryans repeated 
their arguments below,  asserting  they were deprived of an 
opportunity to timely file a notice of appeal from the order 
denying foreclosure reconsid eration because of the  circuit court ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
19 
 staff’s statements .  They also asserted the circuit court abused 
its discretion by denying their request to advance the hearing 
on their February 2, 2018 appeal extension motion, effectively 
denying them leave to file their notice of appeal, especially 
when the circuit court had been lenient with Wilmington ’s and 
its own issues of t imeliness.21   
 Newly attached to t he Ryans ’ opening brief was a 
declaration from Yoshida dated June 20, 2018 , raising matters 
not conta ined in the record on appeal .  Yoshida averred that on 
February 5, 2018, at the request of the circuit court, Yoshida 
participated in a conference call with the cir cuit court and 
Wilmington ’s counsel, and in that conference call, (1) the 
circuit court stated it spoke to its staff about his  
representations, who stated they did not provide incorrect 
information and were upset by the way Yosh ida portrayed them ; 
(2) Yoshida apologized to the circuit court and its staff, but 
stood by his representations , particularly regarding Taiatini ’s 
statements regarding her call with  circuit cou rt staff on 
January 2, 2018,  and (3) the circuit court asked Wilmington ’s 
counsel if Wilmington would stipulate  to an extension of time , 
to which counsel  indicated it was unlikely Wilmington wo uld 
 
21  The Ryans referred to the circuit court’s grant of Wilmington’s six ex 
parte motions for extension of time to serve the com plaint, and nine ex parte 
motions for extension of time to file a pretrial statement; the Ryans argued 
that of those fifteen ex parte motions, eight were untimely.  ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
20 (continued. . .)  
 agree to such a stipulation.  Yoshida asserted that as a result 
of the conference call, he was left with the impression that the 
circuit court believed its staff over Taiatini .  The Ryans 
argued that the circuit court abused its discretion as it 
“abandoned its position of neutrality by seeking out ev idence 
outside the Court record. ”    
  b. Answering brief  
 In its answering brief, Wilmington repeated its  arguments 
below, and also maintained the Ryans ’ February 6, 2018 appeal 
was not timely  as to substantive issues regarding the 
foreclosure .  Wilmington also argued that despite Yoshida’s 
declaration attached t o the opening brief, the record did not 
contain any reference to the February 5, 2018 conference call .  
Wilmington alleged  the Ryans ’ attempt to introduce such 
“evidence ” by way of their declaration violated HRAP Rule 
28(b)(10)  (2016).22   
 
22  HRAP Rule 28(b)(10) states in relevant part: (b) Opening brief.  . . . . 
(10) . . . . Any thing that is not part of the record shall not be appended to 
the brief, except as provided in this Rule.”  
 The occurrence of conference calls should be made part of a trial court 
record.  Minutes routinely reflect the occurrence of off -the-record 
conferen ces with counsel, even if details of the conference are not included 
in the record.  See Hawaiʻi Court Records Rules Rule 3.1 (2012) (“With respect 
to court records, the Clerk of each court shall maintain a record of each 
court case, including a docket, an d shall maintain other records as required 
by statute or rule[]”); Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (“HRS”) § 606 -8 (1993) (“A 
clerk shall attend and record the proceedings at all sittings of courts of 
record.”).  
The Ryans did  not seek to have a  February 5,  2018 conference call made 
a part of the record via stipulation pursuant to HRAP Rule 10(e)(2)(A)  
(2016).  The circuit court did not make a call a part of the record pursuant 
to HRAP Rule 10(e)(2) (B) (“If anything material to any part y is omitted from ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
21 
   c. Reply brief  
 In their reply brief, the Ryans asserted that when parties 
make an inquiry with the court, the parties must be able to rely 
on the information  the court directly pro vides them and must 
also be granted relief if the court  provides  incorrect 
information .   
  d. ICA’s memorandum opinion  
 In its April 9, 2020 memorandum opinion, the ICA rejected 
the Ryans ’ challenges.    
 With respect to the issues we address on certiorari, in 
CAAP-18-0000071, the ICA ruled as follows.  Be cause the order 
denying foreclosure reconsideration  was entered on December 8, 
2017, the notice of appeal from the  foreclosure order, judgment, 
and order denyin g foreclosure reconsideration  was due on January 
8, 2018.  Ryan, mem. op. at 8.  The ICA lacked jurisdiction to 
review th e foreclosure order,  judgment, and order denyin g 
foreclosure reconsideration  because the Ryans did not file the  
first notice of appeal until February 6, 2018 .  Id.  Although 
(. . .continued) 
the record by error or accident or is misstated therein, corrections or 
modifications may be as follows: . . . (B) by the court . . . appealed from, 
either before or after the record is transmitted[.] ”).  Appellate courts are 
also authoriz ed to modify th e record based on HRAP Rule 10(e )(2)(C) (“by 
direction of the appellate court before which the case is pending on proper 
suggestion or its own initiative. ”).  There was no “proper suggestion ” and we 
decline to take the initiative to include a call as part of the record .  The 
record on appeal therefore does not contain any denial of the Taiatini and 
Yoshida declarations regarding statements apparently made by a circuit court 
staff member on January 2, 2018.   ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
22 
 the February 6, 2018 notice of appeal was fi led within thirty 
days after entry of the February 6, 2018 order denying motion to 
advance, giving the ICA appellate court jurisdiction over that 
order, a trial court ’s ruling on a motion to shorten time for, 
advance, or reschedule a hearing is  not subject to review or 
reconsideration.  Id. (citing RCCH Rule 7.2(g)(5)(A )).23  The ICA 
also had appellate jurisdiction over the January 31, 2018 order 
denying ex parte extension motion  as the Ryans filed their 
February 6, 2018 notice of appeal within thirty days after entry 
of that order , which was immediately appealable.  Id. (citing 
Ditto v. McCurdy , 103 Hawaiʻi 153, 157, 80 P.3d 974, 978 (2 003)).  
HRAP Rule 4(a)(4) , however,  allows an ex parte motion for 
extension of time to file a notice of appeal only if the motion 
is filed before expiration of  the original appeal deadline .  
Ryan, mem. op. at 9.  Hence, the January 26, 2018 motion,  which 
came after the January 8, 2018 appeal deadline  expired, should 
not have been filed ex parte.   Id.   
 Thus, the ICA only addressed issues (4) and (5) in the 
February 6, 2018 notice of appeal on the merits, and it affirmed 
the circuit court ’s January 31, 2018 order denying ex parte 
extension motion  and the February 6, 2018 order denying motion 
to advance .  Ryan, mem. op. at 8 -9.  The ICA ruled it lacked 
 
23  See supra note 2. ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
23 
 appellate jurisdiction over issues (1) through (3), which 
concerned substantive issues regarding the foreclosure.   Id. 
 As to CAAP -18-0000312, the ICA concluded that it had 
jurisdiction to  review the Ryans ’ April 6, 2018  notice of 
appeal, which was filed within thirty days after entry of the 
March 8, 2018 o rder denying reconsideration of ex parte appeal 
extension denial.  Ryan, mem. op. at 10 (citing Tax Appeal of 
Subway Real Estate Corp. v. Dir. of Taxation, State of Haw ., 110 
Hawaiʻi 25, 30, 129 P.3d 528, 533 (2006)) .  The ICA also affirmed 
the March 8, 2018 order  on the grounds  the January 26, 2018 
motion was improperly filed ex parte  and therefore 
reconsideration was properly denied .  Id.   
 With respect to CAAP-18-0000388, the ICA concluded that it 
had jurisdiction to review the Ryans ’ May 4, 2018 notice of 
appeal, which was filed within thirty days after entry o f the 
April 5, 2018 order denying the Ryans ’ February 2, 2018 appeal 
extension motion .  Id.  The ICA ruled , however, that  the Ryans 
failed to establish “excusable neglect ” as required by HRAP Rule 
4(a)(4)(B).   Id.  The ICA concluded the circuit court did not 
abuse its discretion by denying the motion to extend time to 
file notice of appeal and affirmed the circuit court ’s April 5, 
2018 appeal extension denial.  Id.

24 
  3. Supreme court proceedings  
  a. Certiorari application  
 In their certiorari application, the Ryans present the 
following question:  
 Did the Intermediate Court of Appeals ( “ICA”) commit 
grave errors of law and/or fail to reconcile obvious 
inconsistencies in its decision with those of the Hawaii 
Supreme Court when the ICA concluded that the Circuit Court 
did not abuse its discretion by denying the moving party ’s 
motion to extend ti me to file notice of appeal where the 
moving party affirmatively inquired directly with the 
Circuit Court about when the order was filed, and the 
Circuit Court staff provided incorrect information to the 
moving party leading the moving party to believe tha t the 
thirty days to file the notice of appeal had not yet begun 
tolling?  
 
  b. Response  
 In its response, in addition to repeating previous 
arguments, Wilmington addressed this court ’s opinion in  Eckard 
Brandes, Inc. v. Department of Labor and Industrial Relations , 
146 Hawaiʻi 354, 463 P.3d 1011 (2020) , issued eleven days after 
the ICA’s memorandum opinion.   Wilmington argues that the Ryans 
failed to show “excusable neglect ” even under the “new standard ” 
of “excusable neglect ” set forth in Eckard Brandes .  Wilmington 
states that Eckard Brandes  “made it clear that any determination 
regarding ‘excusable neglect ’” in HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B) should 
lie in the trial court ’s discretion.  As such, Wilmington 
asserts tha t in a case like this, the circuit court should be 
given even greater latitude as the Ryans are alleging that the 
reason they missed the appeal deadline was due to the circuit ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
25 
 court staff ’s representations, a nd the circuit court would be 
“ideally suited ” to determine whether the alleged 
representations prejudiced the Ryans.  
III. Standards of review  
A. Interpretation of court rules  
 “When interpreting  rules promulgated by the  court, 
principles of statutory construction apply. ” Kawamata Farms, 
Inc. v. United Agri Products , 86 Hawaiʻi 214, 255, 948 P.2d 1055, 
1096 (1997) . “The interpretation of a statute [or rule] is a 
question of law which this court  reviews de novo. ” Id.   
B. Extension of time  
 The grant or denial of a trial court ’s decision to grant a 
motion for extension of time to file a notice of appeal is 
reviewed for abuse of discretion.  Hall v. Hall , 95 Hawaiʻi 318, 
320, 22 P.3d 965 , 967 (2001). 
C. Finding of excusable n eglect 
 
 “A trial court ’s order granting a motion to extend time for 
filing a notice of appeal on the grounds of excusable neglect is 
reviewed for an abuse of discretion. ”  Eckard Brandes , 146 
Hawaiʻi at 358, 463 P.3d at 1015.

 IV. Discussion  
A.  HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B) motions are not properly filed as ex 
parte motions  
 
 An appeal extension motion based on “good cause ” filed 
within the initial thirty days after an appeal deadline 
triggering order or judgment can be submitted ex parte pursuant 
to HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(A).24  A HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B) motion based 
on “excusable neglect ” filed after expiration of the initial 
thirty days , but before expiration of the second thirty days,  
however, is not properly filed on an ex parte basis.  HRAP Rule 
4(a)(4)(B) expressly provides that “[n]otice of an extension 
motion filed after the expiration of the prescribed time shall 
be given to the other parties in accordance with  the rules of 
the court . . . appealed from. ”  Thus, the ICA properly affirmed 
(1) the circuit court ’s January 31, 2018 order denying ex parte 
extension motion , issue (4) in the Ryans ’ February 6, 2018 
appeal in CAAP-18-0000071; and (2) the March 8, 2018 o rder 
denying reconsideration of ex parte appeal extension denial , the 
subject of the Ryans ’ April 6, 2018 appeal in CAAP -18-0000388.25   
Therefore, the remaining issues we address on certiorari 
are the circuit court ’s (1) February 6, 2018 order denying 
 
24  See supra note 9. 
 
25  Circuit courts of course have the authority, whether under RCCH Rule 8 
(1997) or under their HRS §§ 603-21.9(1) and/or (6) (1993) general powers, to 
order that improper ex parte HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B) motions be scheduled for 
hearing or submitted on the briefs.  ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
27 
 motion to advance , which is issue (5) in the Ryans ’ February 6, 
2018 notice of appeal in CAAP -18-0000071; and (2) the April 5, 
2018 order denying the Ryans ’ February 2, 2018 appeal extension 
motion, the subject of the Ryans ’ May 4, 2018 notice of appeal 
in CAAP-18-0000388. 
B. The RCCH Rule 7.2(g)(5)(A) provision disallowing appellate 
review of decisions on m otions to advance  hearings is 
inapplicable to decisions on HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B) motions  
 
 With respect to the circuit court ’s February 6, 2018 order 
denying motion to advance , the ICA ruled that although appellate 
jurisdiction existed , the circuit court ’s ruling denying the 
motion to advance is not subje ct to appellate review.  Ryan, 
mem. op. at 8.  The ICA based its ruling on the langua ge of RCCH 
Rule 7.2(g)(5)(A) , which expressly provides that a judge ’s grant 
or denial of a motion to advance26 is not su bject to review or 
reconsideration .  
 Pursuant to HRAP Rule 2.1(a), various rules of court 
including the HRCP and RCCH “are hereby adopted as a part of 
[the HRAP]  whenever applicable .”  (Emphasis added. ) 
 
26  Technically, this was a motion to shorten time for a hearing, not a 
motion to advance —- the latter terminology applies to requests to advance 
the date or time of hearings that have already been set.  The distinction is 
immaterial, as RCCH Rule 7.2(g)(5)(A) applies to both motions to shorten time 
and motions to advance.  In this case, because the  motion has been referred 
to as one to advance instead of to shorten time, we use that nomenclature.  ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
28 . . . . 
  Preliminarily, HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B) requires that “[n]otice 
of an extension motion filed . . . shall be given to the other 
parties in accordance with the rules of the court . . . appealed  
from.”  Rule 7.2(g)(5)(A) appears within Rule 7.2 governing 
“Civil Motions Practice ” in the circuit courts.  According to 
Rule 7.2(a), “Rule 7.2 applies [] to cases that are governed by 
the Hawaiʻi Rules of Civil Procedure. ”  The underlying circuit 
court case was governed by the HRCP.  Thus, at first blush, RCCH 
Rule 7.2( g)(5)(A) would appear “applicable ” pursuant to HRAP 
Rule 2.1(a) to HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B) motions to extend.  
 As explained below, however, the provision disallowing 
appellate review within RCCH Rule 7.2( g)(5)(A) conflicts with 
the language and intent of HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B ), and its 
application to motions filed pursuant to the rule would create 
unjust and unfair result s.   
 First, n ot allowing appellate review of circuit court 
denials of requests to advance or shorten time for HRAP Rule 
4(a)(4)(B) motion hearings conflicts with  the language and 
intent of HRAP Rule 4( a)(4)(B).  HRAP Rule 4( a)(4)(B) allows for 
the filing of motions to extend time until the appeal deadline 
and implicitly requires  expeditious rulings on these motions .  
As noted, HRAP R ule 4(a)(4)(B) provides:  
(4) Extensions  of Time to File the Notice of Appeal. 
 
 ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
29 
 (B) Requests for Extensions of Time After Expiration 
of the Prescribed Time .  The court or agency appealed 
from, upon a showing of excusable neglect, may extend 
the time for filing the notice of appeal upon motion  
filed not later than 30 days after the expiration of 
the time prescribed by subsections (a)(1) through 
(a)(3) of this R ule.  However, no such extension 
shall exceed 30 days past the prescribed time.  
Notice of an extension motion filed after the 
expiration of the prescribed time shall be given to 
the other parties in accordance with t he rules of the 
court . . . appealed fr om. 
  
(Emphasis added. ) 
 Thus, HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B) expressly allows a motion to 
extend time to appeal for an additional thirty days after 
expiration of the initial thirty days to be filed up until the 
thirtieth day after expiration of the initial time for filing an 
appeal.  Although sa tisfaction of the “excusable neglect ” 
standard would require parties to file their motions as soon as 
possible, the rule expressly allows the motion to be filed right 
up to the deadline, and envisions an expeditious ruling on such 
motion.27    
Second, when a literal interpretation  of a court statute or 
court rule would lead to  absurd or unjust results, the court may 
depart from its plain reading.   United Agri Products , 86 Hawaiʻi 
at 255, 948 P.2d at 1096; Franks v. City & Cty. of Honolulu , 74 
Haw. 328, 341, 843 P.2d 668, 674 (1993)  (principles of st atutory 
construction apply to interpretation of court rules).  For the 
 
27  For example, a solo practitioner or a self -represented litigant who 
intended to file a notice of appeal within the first thirty days could become 
seriously ill and be hospitalized up to just before the HRAP Rule 4(A)(4)(B) 
deadline.   ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
30 
 reasons below, s ubjecting HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B) motions t o the 
RCCH 7.2(g)(5)(A) provision disa llowing appellate review of 
circuit court  grants or denial s of motions to advance  hearings  
could lead to  absurd or unjust results . 
Pursuant to RCCH Rule 7.2(b) and Exhibit B attached to the 
RCCH, a motion to extend time under HRAP Rule 4( a)(4)(B) is a 
hearing motion , which is generally heard on at least eighteen 
days notice .  In circuit court civil cases, RCCH Rule 7(a) also 
generally requires that motions be served eighteen days before 
their hearing dates.   
 Circuit courts  have discretion , however,  in the scheduling 
of hearings  on motions .  Although c ircuit courts can also order 
HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B) motions to be submitted on the briefs ,28 
normal course hearings in circuit courts are often scheduled to 
be heard more than eighteen days after filing.  For example, i n 
this case, the circuit court scheduled a September 5, 2017 
hearing date on Wilmington ’s June 21, 2017 summary judgment 
motion for foreclosure .  The circuit court scheduled a March 6, 
2018 hearing da te on the Ryans ’ February 2, 2018 appeal 
extension motion.   
 
28  RCCH Rule 8 provides, “The court on its motion may order any matter 
submitted on the briefs and/or affidavits, without oral argument. ”  (RCCH 
Rule 7(g) allows substitutio n of affidavits with unsworn declarations under 
penalty of law.)  ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
31 
  Thus, RCCH Rule 8 provides that “[m]otions will be heard 
upon 18 days written notice in accordance with Rule 7 herein, 
unless otherwise ordered by the court[.]”  RCCH Rule 
7.2(g)(5)(A) therefore allows circuit courts to shorten time for 
or advance a hearing  on a civil motion .  The Ryans ’ February 2, 
2018 appeal extension motion  to advance (or shorten time) 
explicitly pointed  out that a normal course setting would n ot 
allow their motion to be decided by the deadline for filing an 
appeal.  The circuit court denied the motion to advance on 
February 6, 2018, and set the hearing in its normal course, for 
March 6, 2018.   The circuit court could have expeditiously 
schedule d a hearing on the Ryans ’ February 2, 2018 extension 
motion.29   
Not allowing appellate review for abuse of discretion on  
RCCH 7.2(g)(5)(A) motions to shorten time or advance hearings on 
HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B) motions would allow  circuit courts that (1) 
do not order that such motions be submitted on the briefs 
pursuant to RCCH Rule 8 and expeditiously rule ; or (2) schedule 
normal course hearings more than thirty days from filing , to 
effectively deny any opportunity to extend time for filing an 
appeal based on HR AP Rule 4( a)(4)(B), despite the latter rule ’s 
language and intent.  Hence, a literal interpretation  applying 
 
29  Although the hearing motion was not filed until February 2, 2018, the 
ex parte motion had been filed on January 26, 2018, and Wilmington had 
already responded to the merits of the motion o n January 30, 2018.  ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***

 the RCCH 7.2(g)(5)(A) provision disallowing appellate review of 
circuit court decisions on motions to advance HRAP Rule 
4(a)(4)(B) motions would lead to  absurd or unjust results.30   
We therefore hold, pursuant to HRAP Rule 2.1(a) , that t he 
RCCH Rule 7.2(g )(5)(A) provision disallowing appellate review of 
decisions on m otions to advance  hearings is inapplicable to 
decisions on HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B) motions.   
C. The circuit court abused its discretion by denying the 
 motion to advance hearing on the Ryans ’ motion to extend 
 time for filing a notice of appeal  
 
 Having ruled appellate review of the circuit court ’s 
February 6, 2018 order denying motion to advance is a llowed, we 
next address whether the circuit court abused  its discretion by 
denying the motion and not scheduling a hearing by the February 
7, 2018 deadline.  As noted above, HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B) 
expressly allows a motion to extend time to file a notice of 
appeal for an additional thirty days after expiration of the 
initial thirty days to be filed up until the thirtieth day after 
expiration of the initial time f or filing an appeal .  Although 
parties should not wait until the last minute  and failure to 
timely file under HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B) is relevant to whether 
 
30  We also note the absurdity of not allowing appellate review of circuit 
court decisions on motions to advance or shorten time on HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B) 
motions for an abuse of discretion based on RCCH Rule 7.2(g)(5)(A), when 
there is no comparable district court rule, and district court decisions on 
the scheduling of HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B) motions would be subject to appellate 
review for abuse of discretion.  ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
33 (continued. . .)  
 “excusable neglect ” exists, under the circumstances of this 
case, we hold that the circuit court abused its discretion by 
denying the motion to advance.  
 With respect to whether the hearing should have been 
advanced , because the Yoshida and Taiatini declarations were not 
refuted with any other evidence  in the record  on appeal , they 
are taken as true.31  Thus, there is nothing in the record on 
appeal contradicting the Ryans ’ representations that they 
checked for the status of the order denying reconsideration 
weekly after the November 20, 2017 RCCH Rule 23 notice of 
submission of the proposed order denying  foreclosure 
reconsideration, that u pon not seeing it in Hoʻohiki by January 
2, 2018, they called the circuit court ’s chambers and were told 
by staff that the “order was not entere d, that the order  might 
be on [the judge ’s] desk, that [the judge ] was out at the time, 
and that they will fo llow up on the following Monday [,]” and 
that the Ryans did not realize the order had been entered on 
December 8, 2017, until they re -checked Hoʻohiki on January 25, 
2018.32  The circuit court would have been able to schedule , 
 
31  See supra note 22.  
 
32  At some point, Hoʻohiki showed that the order had been  filed on December 
8, 2017.  However, the filing of the order on December 8, 2017, does not mean 
that Hoʻohiki reflected the filing of the document on that date.   Before 
circuit court civil cases migrated to eCourt K okua on October 28, 2019 , 
docket entries  regarding document filing had to be manually entered into ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
34 
 conduct a hearing, and enter an order on the motion before the 
February 7, 2018 deadline .  We therefore hold that the circuit 
court abused its discretion in denying the motion to advance.  
D. The Ryans showed “excusable neglect ” and their February 2, 
 2018 appeal extension motion should have been granted  
 
 Finally, w e address whether the Ryans ’ February 2, 2018 
HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B) appeal extension motion should also have 
been granted.  The Ryans maintain the circuit court abused its 
discretion by denying this motion.   Because the initial thirty -
day appeal deadline had passed, the Ryans had to show “excusable 
neglect” to obtain an extension.     
 In general, trial courts should allow parties to exercise 
their appeal rights.  As Wilmington notes, in Eckard Brandes , 
this court ruled that “as indicated by the United States Supreme 
Court in Pioneer[ Investment Services Co. v. Brunswick 
Associates Ltd. Partnership ], 507 U.S. 380  [(1993)]  . . ., 
whether ‘excusable neglect ’ exists [to obtain a HRAP Rule 
4(a)(4)(B) extension ] is ‘at bottom an equitable ’ decision; it 
is necessary to first determine whether there is ‘neglect, ’ and, 
if so, whether the ‘neglect’ is ‘excusable. ’”  146 Hawaiʻi at 
364, 463 P.3d at 1021.  Eckard Brandes  clarified that 
“‘excusable neglect ’ is to be construed pursuant to its plain  
(. . .continued) 
Hoʻohiki.  Sometimes the manual entry of document filing was delayed.  With 
the migration to eCourt K okua, this should no longer be an issue.    ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
35 
 language: ‘neglect’ that is ‘excusable, ’ which, ‘involve[s] a 
broad, equitable, inquiry ’ ‘taking into account all relevant 
circumstances s urrounding the party ’s omission[,] ’” and “the 
determination of whether ‘excusable neglect ’ exists should lie 
largely in the discretion of the court. ”  Id. (first alteration 
in original).  
 Even if the steps the Ryans took constituted “neglect, ”33 
the neglect was “excusable. ”  The Ryans represent they checked 
Hoʻohiki weekly for the status of the order denying 
reconsideration weekly after the November 20, 2017 RCCH Rule 23 
notice of submission of the proposed order denying foreclosure 
reconsideration, and that upon not seeing it in Hoʻohiki by 
January 2, 2018, they called the circuit court ’s chambers on 
January 2, 2018 .  Their representations regarding statements 
made by circuit court staff on that date are not contradicted in 
the record  on appeal .  Also, Yoshida averred he and Taiatini did 
not realize the order had been entere d on December 8, 2017, 
until they re -checked Hoʻohiki on January 25, 2018.34  
 
33  We note that Hoʻohiki contains a disclaimer that the Judiciary “does not 
guarantee or represent that the information contains no errors, omissions, or 
inaccuracies.   The user is responsible for assessing the accuracy and 
reliability of the information provided on the webs ite.”  Also, as Wilmington  
argues, the Ryans could have called the circuit court after January 2, 2018 
and also did not contact Wilmington’s  counsel to check on the status of the 
order denying foreclosure  reconsideration.    
 
34  See supra note 32.  ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***

  Eckard Brandes  had not been decided as of the time of the 
circuit court and ICA decisions.  In rejecting the Ryans ’ 
argument s regarding “excusable neglect ,” the ICA relied on  Enos 
v. Pacific Transfer & Warehouse, Inc. , 80 Hawaiʻi 345, 910 P.2d 
116 (1996) .  Ryan, mem. op. at 10 -11.  The ICA characterized the 
Ryans’ argument as blaming the circuit court clerk for their 
failure to timely file a notice of appeal, and ruled excusable 
neglect did not exist .  Id. 
 Enos is clearly distingu ishable.  In Enos, movant ’s counsel  
had actual notice of the filing of the judgment eighteen days 
before the initial appeal deadline.  80 Hawaiʻi at 353, 910 P.2d 
at 124.  The primary basis for the motion to extend was 
counsel’s belief  that the time for filing a notice of appeal wa s 
triggered by the filing of a  notice of entry of judgment rather 
than by the filing of the judgment itself.   80 Hawaiʻi at 354, 
910 P.2d at 125.  We held the trial court abused its discretion 
by granting the motion to extend time for filing a notice of 
appeal because the failure to timely file the appeal was caused 
by counsel ’s failure to read and comply  with the plain language 
of applicable procedural rules, which cannot constitute 
“excusable neglect. ”  80 Hawaiʻi at 355, 910 P.2d at 126.   
 Although the Ryans ’ January 26, 2018 ex parte motion did 
not comply with applicable procedural rule s, their February 2, 
2018 motions to extend and advance the hearing  did.  They did ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***  
 
37 
 not know until January 25, 2018, that the order triggering 
appeal deadline s had been filed on December 8, 2017 .   
 Wilmington also bears responsibility for this lack of 
knowledge of the December 8, 2017 filing of the order denying  
foreclosure  reconsideration.  As explained earlier, on November 
20, 2017, Wilmington filed a RCCH Rule 23 notice of submission 
of the proposed order with a certificate of service on the 
Ryans’ counsel.  In this  certificate of service, Wilmington ’s 
counsel expressly s tated, “The undersigned hereby certifies a 
copy of the foregoing Order will be duly served upon the ” Ryans’ 
counsel “when filed copies are received [.]”  Yet, and in 
contravention of HRCP Rule 5 ’s requirement of service, according 
to the record, Wilmington did not serve a file -stamped copy of 
the December 8, 2017 order denying foreclosure reconsideration 
on the Ryans ’ counsel until February 26, 2018.  The Ryans ’ 
counsel immediately took action  after learning of the December 
8, 2017 filing on January 25, 2018 .   
 Thus, the circumstances of this case indicate that even if 
there was “neglect, ” under a “broad, equitable, inquiry ” “taking 
into account all relevant circumstances surrounding the party ’s 
omission[,] ” the “neglect” was “excusable ” under the 
circumstances.    
 Hence, we hold that the circuit court abused its discretion 
by denying the  Ryans’ February 2, 2018 appeal extension motion .   ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER    ***

  As there were abuses of discretion in denying the February 
2, 2018 motions to advance hearing and to extend the time for 
filing an appeal , the Ryans ’ February 6, 2018 notice of appeal 
in CAAP-18-0000071 was timely filed from the December 8, 2017 
order denying foreclosure reconsideration.  Therefore, we remand 
to the ICA to consider the merits of the other issues over which 
appellate jurisdiction exists based on the Ryans ’ timely appeal 
of the December 8, 2017  order denying foreclosure 
reconsideration . 
V. Conclusion  
 Based on the reasons above, we vacate the ICA ’s May 7, 2020 
judgment on appeal and remand to the ICA for further proceedings 
consistent with this opinion.
