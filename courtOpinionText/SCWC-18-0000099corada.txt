ORDER OF CORRECTION  
(By: McKenna, J.)  
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Opinion of the Court, 
filed on September  10,  2024, is corrected as follows:  
1. On page 2, r emove the word “Domingos” so that the 
sentence  reads,  “Isabelo Pacpaco Domingo (“Mr. Domingo”) and his 
wife, Michele Elanor Domingo (“Mrs. Domingo”), (collectively, 
“the Domingos”) defaulted on a mortgage refinance loan for their 
Kailua-Kona property.”   
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2. On page 10, r emove the word “in” so that the phrase 
reads, “which adopted the general rule .” 
3. On page 12, i nsert “a” so the text reads, “BBNY was a 
good faith purchaser.” 
4. Change two mentions of “Domingos’s” on pages 12 and 22 
to “Domingos’” for consistency. 
5. On page 32, change “is” to “are” so the sentence reads, 
“that res judicata principles underlying compulsory 
counterclaims are intended to prevent.” 
The Clerk of the Court is directed to take all 
necessary steps to notify the publishing agencies of these 
changes. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawaii, September 23, 2024.
