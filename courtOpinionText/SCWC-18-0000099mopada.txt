2 an application for writ of certiorari, challenging the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals’ (ICA)  August 26, 2022 amended 
summary disposition order (Amended SDO).  The ICA dismissed the 
Domingos’ appeal as moot.  
On March 13, 2013, Bank of America, N.A. (Bank of 
America) filed a complaint  in the Circuit Court of the Third 
Circuit (circuit court)  against the Domingos, alleging that Bank 
of America was entitled to foreclosure of the  mortgage executed 
by the Domingos.  Bank of America subsequently assigned its 
interest in the note to Respondent/Plaintiff -Appellee Wilmington 
Savings Fund Society, FSB , Doing Business as Christina Trust, 
Not in its Individual Capacity, But Solely as Trustee for BCAT 
2015-14BTT (Wilmington) .  Wilmington was then substituted as the 
plaintiff in the foreclosure proceeding . 
After the circuit court denied Wilmington’s initia l 
motion for summary judgment, Wilmington filed a renewed motion 
for summary judgment, which the circuit court granted.  
Wilmington then purchased the property at the foreclosure 
auction and, while the Domingos’ appeal w as pending, sold the 
Property to BBN Y REO LLC, a Florida Limited Liability Company 
(BBNY).  The Domingos did not post a supersedeas bond or 
otherwise obtain a stay , but the Domingos did file a separate 
complaint for wrongful foreclosure.  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
3 During the pendency of the Domingos’ appeal, 
Wilmingto n filed a motion to dismiss in the ICA, arguing that 
the Domingos’ appeal w as moot because the property was sold to 
BBNY, a third -party, good -faith purchaser.   The Domingos 
disputed that BBNY was a third -party, good -faith purchaser.   The 
ICA agreed with Wilmington , determined that BBNY was a third -
party, good -faith purchaser , and dismissed the Domingos’ appeal 
as moot.  
On certiorari, the Domingos raise three arguments.   
First, the Domingos argue that the ICA erroneously determined  
the property was conveyed to a third -party, good -faith purchaser 
because of the Domingos’ pending wrongful foreclosure action.  
Second, the Domingos contend that the ICA mistakenly determined  
no effective relief can be gra nted to the Domingos because of 
the Domingos’ pending wrongf ul foreclosure action.  Third, the 
Domingos assert that the ICA erroneously relied on new evidence 
to determine BBNY was a third -party, good -faith purchaser.  
The Domingos’ third argument has merit.   The ICA 
improperly relied on new evidence submitted with Wilmington’s 
motion to dismiss to determine that BBNY was a third -party, 
good-faith purchaser, which was a disputed  factual issue.  
Instead of making a factual determination  that BBNY was a third -
party, good -faith purchaser, the ICA should have temporarily 
remanded the case to the circuit court to make such a *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
4 determination.   Accordingly, we vacate the ICA’s August 26, 2022 
Amended SDO , which dismissed the Domingos’ appeal as moot, 
because the ICA sh ould have temporarily remanded the case to the 
circuit court  for an evidentiary hearing  to determine whether 
BBNY was a third -party, good -faith purchaser.  
II. BACKGROUND  
A. Relevant Circuit Court Proceedings  
On March 13, 2013, Bank of America filed a “Complaint 
for Foreclosure” ( Complaint ) in the circuit court.  The 
Complaint alleged as follows.  T he Domingos owne d property in 
Kailua-Kona, Hawaiʻi (the Property) .  On or about February 15, 
2007, Isabelo Pacpaco Domingo executed and delivered a 
promissory note in th e amount of $625,500.00 (the Note) to 
SecurityNational Mortgage Company (Security National).  In 
addition, Michele Elanor Domingo executed and delivered a 
mortgage (the Mortgage) to Mortgage Electronic Registration 
Systems, Inc., solely as nominee for Secu rity National.  On 
March 12, 2012, the mortgagee’s interest in the Mortgage was 
assigned to Bank of America.  
On November 3, 2016, Bank of America filed a “Non -
Hearing Motion for Order Substituting [Wilmington] as Plaintiff 
and Real Party in Interest Herein ” (Motion to Substitute ).  In a 
declaration attached to the motion, Bank of America’s counsel 
noted that the Mortgage was assigned from Bank of America to *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
5  Wilmington on July 11, 2016.  The circuit court issued an order 
granting the Motion to Substitute on November 25, 2016.1   
On July 17, 2017, Wilmington filed a “Motion for 
Summary Judgment and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure” 
(Motion for Summary Judgment ), which the Domingos opposed.  In 
its Motion for Summary Judgment, Wilmington admitted that Ba nk 
of America lost the original Note and “executed a Lost Note 
Affidavit establishing [Bank of America] was entitled to enforce 
the Note at the time it was lost.”2  The circuit court held a 
hearing on the Motion for Summary Judgment on August 8, 2017.  
The circuit court denied Wilmington’s Motion for Summary 
Judgment because  genuine issues of fact existed with respect to 
the lost note.3  
On December 1, 2017, Wilmington filed a “Renewed 
Motion for Summary Judgment and for Interlocutory Decree of 
Foreclosure”  (Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment) , which the 
Domingos opposed.  That same day , the Domingos filed  their own  
motion for summary judgment , which Wilmington opposed.  
                     
1  The Honorable Ronald Ibarra presided.  
 
2  Although the lost note raises several issues, those issues are not 
relevant to the disposition of the Domingos’ application for writ of 
certiorari.  
 
3  The Honorable Henry T. Nakamoto presided.  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
6 The circuit court conducted a hearing on Wilmington’s 
Renewed Motion for Summary Judgmen t and the Domingos’ motion for 
summary judgment on December 27, 2017.  Then, after Wilmington 
and the Domingos filed proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions 
of Law, the circuit court issued “Findings of Fact and 
Conclusions of Law; Order Granting Plaintiff’s Renewed Motion 
for Summary Judgment and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure 
Filed December 1, 2017”  on January 29, 2018.4  The circuit court 
concluded that Wilmington owned and was entitled to foreclose 
the Mortgage, and ordered the Propert y to be sold at a public 
auction.  
Wilmington then purchased the Property at the 
foreclosure sale , which the circuit court confirmed.  While the 
Domingos’ appeals were pending, Wilmington sold the Property to 
BBNY.  The Domingos did not post a supersedeas b ond or otherwise 
obtain a stay.  The Domingos filed a complaint for wrongful 
foreclosure and quiet title  on October 1, 2018.  
B. ICA Proceedings  
1. Opening Brief 
On February 20, 2018,  the Domingos filed a notice of 
appeal in CAAP-18-0000099.5  The Domingos filed an opening brief 
                     
4  The Honorable Robert D.S. Kim presided.  
 
5  On September 14, 2018, the Domingos filed a notice of appeal in CAAP -
18-0000712.  The appeals were consolidated.   After the appeals were *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
7 on June 4, 2018.  The Domingos asserted one point of error, 
contending that the circuit court erroneously denied “the 
Domingos’ motion for summary judgment, and  [erred] in granting 
summary judgment in favor of [Wilmington]  -- who admitted that 
it was never in possession of the original promissory note -- in 
violation of the clear and unambiguous language of  [Hawaiʻi 
Revised Statutes (HRS)  §] 490:3-309.”   
The Domingos argued that  Wilmington admit ted it was 
not the holder of the Note and that Bank of America lost the 
Note before Wilmington purchased the loan.   The Domingos 
therefore asserted that  Wilmington  “could not prove the 
existence of the promissory note”  or “that it was entitled to 
enforce the promissory note.”6 
The Domingos maintained that Wilmington “did not 
establish it was entitled to enforce the note” pursuant to HRS 
§§ 490:3-301 and 490:3 -309.  The Domingos pointed out that  
Wilmington alleged that prior -plaintiff Bank of America assigned 
the mortgage to Wilmington on June 16, 2016, and the circuit 
court subsequently entered an order allowing Wilmington to 
substitute as plaintiff.   The Domingos asserted that  Wilmington 
                     
consolidated , the parties were ordered to “file all documents related to 
[both] appeals in CAAP -18-0000099.”  
 
6  The Domingos noted that the circuit court denied Wilmington’s earlier 
motion for summary judgment filed on July 17, 2017, because Wilmington 
admitted Bank of America lost the Note before Wilmington acquired the loan.  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
8 conceded “that Bank of America was never able to transfer the 
note to it.”  
According to the Domingos,  Wilmington was not entitled 
to enforce the Note under HRS §  490:3-301 because Wilmington was 
not in possession of the original note when it was lost.   The 
Domingos also contended that  Wilmington was not  “the holder of 
the note, or a nonholder in possession of the note who has the 
rights of a holder under  [HRS §] 490:3-301.”  Citing to Bank of 
Am., N.A.  v. Reyes -Toledo, 139 Hawaiʻi 361, 371 n.17, 390 P.3d 
1248, 12 58 n.17 (2017), the Domingos reiterated  that Wilmington 
was not entitled to foreclose the mortgage because Wilmington 
was not entitled to enforce the Note.7  The Domingos therefore 
asserted that the circuit court improperly granted Wilmington’s 
Renewed Motion for Summary, and that the Domingos’ motion for 
summary judgment should have been granted.  
2. Answering Brief  
Wilmington filed an answering brief on August 15, 
2018.  Wilmington disagreed with the Domingos’ arguments for the 
following two reasons.   First, Wilmington argued that “HRS 
§ 490:3-309 permits the enforcement of a lost note by an 
assignee of the entity who lost the note  . . . .”  Second, 
                     
7  The Domingos presented other arguments, which are not relevant  to 
disposition of the Domingos’ application for writ of  certiorari, regarding 
why Wilmington was not entitled to enforce the los t note and why the circuit 
court improperly granted summary judgment in favor of Wilmington.  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
9 Wilmington argued that  it was “entitled to enforce the note in 
this case pursuant to the doctrine of equitable s ubrogation, in 
equity, and based upon breach of contract.”  
3. Wilmington’s Motion to Dismiss  
On April 1, 2022, Wilmington filed a “Motion to 
Dismiss Defendant -Appellants Isabelo Pacpaco Domingo and Michele 
Elanor Domingo’s Appeal Filed February 2 1, 2018” (Mot ion to 
Dismiss)  pursuant to Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 27  
(2016).8  Wilmington argued that “the Domingos’ appeal is moot ” 
because the Property’s title was transferred to a third -party, 
good-faith purchaser.  
Citing to  Bank of N.Y. Mellon v. R . Onaga, Inc. , 140 
Hawaiʻi 358, 370, 400 P.3d 559 , 367 (2017), Wilmington  maintained  
that “[a]n Appellant challenging a foreclosure must post a 
supersedeas bond or otherwise obtain a stay” and “[a]n Appellant 
‘who has failed to obtain a stay by posting a bond, may not 
attack a good -faith purchaser’s title to the property purchased 
at a judicial sale and confirmed by court order.’”  Wilmington 
noted that the Domingos did not post a supersedeas bo nd or 
obtain a stay  and that Wilmington purchased the Property at a 
judicially supervised sale .  Wilmington then “sold its interest 
                     
8  Attached to the Motion to Dismiss were a “Declaration of Selene 
Finance, LP,” a “Declaration of BBNY,” a “Declaration of David B. Rosen,” and 
“Exhibits A -E.” 
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
10 in the Property to ” BBNY.  According to Wilmington, BBNY was a 
third-party, good -faith purchaser and the Domingos could not 
contest “BBNY’s title to the Property.”9   
Wilmington further noted that  the Property’s 
Certificate of Title was certified in favor of Wilmington before 
it sold the property to BBNY,  which demonstrated the Domingos  
had no interest  in the Property  and Wilmi ngton was entitled to 
sell the Property to BBNY .  According to Wilmington,  the fact 
that it purchased the Property at the foreclosure sale and 
subsequently sold the Property to BBNY further demonstrated that 
the Domingos’ appeal was moot.   Wilmington thus reiterated  that 
there was no effective remedy and the Domingos’ appeal was moot.  
  On April 6, 2022, the Domingos filed  an opposition to 
Wilmington’s Motion to Dismiss.  The Domingos argued that, inter 
alia, the ICA “is not a court where evidence can be taken,” and 
the case must be remanded to the circuit court for an 
evidentiary hearing to determine whether BBNY was a third -party, 
good-faith purchaser.   The Domingos further contended that the 
ICA’s review on appeal should be  based only on the record, and  
the sale of the Property to BBNY is not in the record.  
                     
9  Wilmington maintained that “title to the Property was recorded in 
BBNY’s name on January 4, 2022, in the Land Court.”  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
11 4. ICA Amended Summary Disposition Order  
On August 26, 2022, the ICA issued an Amended SDO .10  
The ICA dismissed the Domingos’ appeal as moot.  The ICA noted 
that the Domingos did not “obtain a supersedea s bond and thus 
failed to obtain a stay pending this appeal .”  The ICA also 
noted that “it is the appellant’s burden to seek a stay if post -
appeal transactions could render the appeal moot.”  
  Citing to City Bank v. Saje Ventures II , 7 Haw. App. 
130, 133, 748 P.2d 812, 814 (19 88),11 the ICA pointed out that 
“[t]he general rule is that the right of a good faith purchaser 
to receive property acquired at a judicial sale cannot be 
affected by the reversal of an order ratifying the sale where a 
supersedeas bond h as not been filed” unless “the reversal is 
based on jurisdiction grounds or where the purchaser is the 
mortgagee [because]  he ‘does not free himself from the 
underlying dispute to which he is a party .’”12   
                     
10  The ICA issued a summary disposition order ( SDO) on July 14, 2022, 
which dismissed the Domingos’ appeal as moot.  On July 25, 2022, t he Domingos 
filed a motion for reconsideration.  On August 26, 2022, the ICA issued an 
“Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Motion for Reconsideration.”  The 
ICA granted the Domingos’ motion for reconsideration with respect to section 
II.B of the SD O.  Section II.B of the SDO is not relevant to the Domingos’ 
application for writ of certiorari.  
The ICA’s SDO and Amended SDO both concluded that the Domingos’ appeal 
should be dismissed as moot.  
 
11  Citing to Bank of N .Y. Mellon v. R. Onaga, Inc., 140 Hawaiʻi 358, 367, 
400 P.3d 559, 568 (2017), the ICA noted tha t this court  adopted the rule from 
City Bank v. Saje Ventures II , 7 Haw.  App. 130, 748 P.2d 812 (1988).  
 
12  In City Bank , the ICA “noted there was nothing to indicate the third -
party purchaser was not a good -faith purchaser and there was no stay of the 
confirmation order, and thus the appeal was deemed to be moot.”  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
12   The ICA acknowledged that the instant case was 
distinguishable from Onaga because the third -party, good -faith 
purchasers in Onaga “obtained the property directly from the 
foreclosure sale.”   However,  citing to DB Private Wealth Mortg., 
Ltd. v. Bouley , 138 Hawaiʻi 141, 377 P.3d 1059 (Ap p. 2016), the 
ICA noted that Wilmington purchased the Property at the 
foreclosure sale and subsequently sold it to BBNY, and concluded 
that BBNY is a third -party, good -faith purchaser.  
  The ICA pointed out t he Domingos argued that 
Wilmington did not expla in how BBNY is a third -party, good -faith 
purchaser.   The ICA disagreed and  stated: 
 Wilmington has provided, inter alia , a declaration by 
William J. Bymel, manager of BBNY (Bymel Declaration).   
Bymel attests that BBNY entered into an agreement to 
purchase and did purchase the subject property from 
Wilmington.  Bymel further attests that BBNY is not 
affiliated with or otherwise related to or connected to 
Wilmington or its loan servicer, Selene Finance, LP, and 
that the price and terms of the purchase were ne gotiated at 
“arms-length.”  The Bymel Declaration indicates that BBNY 
is a good -faith purchaser and the Domingos fail to show 
otherwise.  See City Bank , 7 Haw. App. At 133, 748 P.2d at 
814-15 (noting that the purchaser of the property was a 
third-party not  involved in the case and “[t]here is 
nothing in the record to indicate that [the third -party 
purchaser] was not a good faith purchaser”); see also  
[Lathrop v. Sakatani , 111 Hawaiʻi 307, 313 -14, 141 P.3d 480, 
486-87 (2006)]  (noting in an appeal from an ord er expunging 
a lis pendens  that “it is appellant’s burden to seek a stay 
if post-appeal transactions could render the appeal moot” 
                     
 The ICA correctly pointed out that  “[t]he general rule is that the 
right of a good faith purchaser to receive property acquired at a ju dicial 
sale cannot be affected by the reversal of an order ratifying the sale where 
a supersedeas bond has not been filed .”  However, the Domingos’ failure to 
post a supersedeas bond is not relevant on certiorari because mortgagee 
Wilmington purchased the Property from the foreclosure sale , which is an 
exception to the general rule .  In addition, the Domingos explicitly argue 
that BBNY was not a third -party, good -faith purchaser.   Thus, the ICA should 
have temporarily remanded the case to the circuit court to determine whether 
BBNY was a third -party, good -faith purchaser.  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
13 and holding that a completed sale of the subject property 
rendered the appeal moot).  
  Citing to Onaga, 140 Hawaiʻi at 367 n.13, 400 P.3d at 
568 n.13, the ICA noted that this court stated:  
[w]hen the Ferraras purchased the Property, the circuit 
court had already determined in the consolidated 
proceedings that BONY had a first priority lien on the 
Property.  Thus, at th e time of the purchase, there would 
not have been an “infirmity in the title” based on Onaga’s 
mortgage.  
The ICA pointed out that “[h]ere, when BBNY purchased the 
subject property, the Circuit Court had already issued its 
foreclosure decree via its Foreclo sure Order and Foreclosure 
Judgment, and confirmed the foreclosure sale via the 
Confirmation Order and Confirmation Judgment.”  The  ICA 
determined that “at the time BBNY purchased the property from 
Wilmington, there was no ‘infirmity in the title’ based on  the 
Domingos’ mortgage to bar BBNY from purchasing the property in 
good-faith.”  The ICA thus concluded that no effective relief 
could be granted to the Domingos and dismissed the Domingos’ 
appeal as moot.13 
C. Application for Writ of Certiorari  
The Domingos filed a timely application for writ of 
certiorari on October 7, 2022.  As relevant here ,14 the Domingos 
                     
13  The Amended SDO was actually an order of dismissal because the ICA 
dismissed the Domingos’ appeal after Wilmington filed the Motion to Dismiss, 
and because the ICA expressly stated the “ appeal is dismissed  as moot.”  
(Emphasis added.)  Thus, the ICA was not required to issue a judgment on 
appeal.  See Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure  Rule 36(b)(1)  (2016). 
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
14 argue that  the ICA erroneously  “adjudicate[ed]  a contested 
factual issue based upon new evidence not contained within the 
record on appeal.”   The Domingos note that  “in dismissing these 
appeals, the ICA relied upon its unpublished decision in  
[Bouley] as justification for considering Wilmington’s 
evidence.”  The Domingos contend that “ Bouley is entirely 
distinguishable.”  According to the Domi ngos, “Bouley did not 
involve a motion to dismiss an appeal based upon new evidence 
presented for the first time in an appellate court.”  The 
Domingos argue that “the appellants in Bouley did not challenge 
whether the purchaser of the property was a good f aith 
purchaser.”  The Domingos maintain that “[u]nlike here, the 
adjudicat ive facts in Bouley were contained within the record on 
appeal.”  
In addition, citing to HRS §  641-2(b), the Domingos 
maintain that new evidence cannot be introduced in an appellate 
court and an appeal must be taken on the record.  The Domingos 
further contend that “allowing appellate courts to review 
evidence submitted after summary judgment has been granted would 
overturn well -settled Hawaiʻi law.”  Thus, the Domingos assert 
that “the ICA committed grave error” by “dismissing the 
                     
14  Because the Domingos correctly argue that the ICA should have 
temporarily remanded the case to the circuit court for an evidentiary hearing 
to determine if BBNY was a third -party, good -faith purchaser, this memorandum 
opinion does not address the Domingos’  additional arguments on certiorari.  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
15 Domingos’ appeals after adjudicating evidence outside the record 
introduced for the first time on appeal and finding that BBNY is 
a good faith purchaser .  . . .” 
  On Novembe r 14, 2022, Wilmington filed a response to 
the Domingos’ application for writ of certiorari.  As relevant 
here, Wilmington notes that the Domingos maintain “that the ICA 
could not make a determination on whether BBNY was a third -
party, good -faith purchaser , as [the Domingos] assert that this 
evidentiary determination must be remanded to the Circuit 
Court.”  According to Wilmington,  the ICA correctly noted that  
“this issue was addressed in Onaga.”  Wilmington contends that 
“[t]herein, the third -party good -faith purchasers intervened 
while the appeal was pending and moved to dismiss based upon 
mootness, and the Hawaii Supreme Court made the determination 
that the appeal was moot without a remand to the circuit court.”  
  The Domingos filed a reply on November 2 1, 2022.   
III.   DISCUSSION  
A. The Domingos correctly argue  that the ICA should have 
temporarily remanded the case to the circuit court to 
determine whether BBNY is a third -party, good -faith 
purchaser.  
On certiorari, the Domingos  argue that  the ICA 
improperly adju dicated a disputed  “factual issue based upon new 
evidence not contained within the record on appeal.”  As 
discussed below, HRS §  641-2(b) limits an appellate court’s *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
16 review of a case to the record and  thus prohibits new evidence 
from being introduced in an appellate  court in order to resolve 
a disputed issue of fact .  In addition, this court’s decision in 
Onaga does not stand for the proposition that an appellate court 
can make a factual finding that a party is a third -party, good -
faith purchaser.  
1. HRS § 641-2(b) 
The Domingos argue that, pursuant to HRS §  641-2(b), 
the ICA was not permitted to accept and consider  new evidence on 
appeal in order to resolve a disputed issue of fact .  HRS §  641-
2(b) (2016) provides:  
 [(b)] Every appeal shall be taken on the  record, and 
no new evidence shall be introduced in the supreme court .  
The appellate court may correct any error appearing on the 
record, but need not consider a point that was not 
presented in the trial court in an appropriate manner.  No 
judgment, order , or decree shall be reversed, amended, or 
modified for any error or defect, unless the court is of 
the opinion that it has injuriously affected the 
substantial rights of the appellant.  
(Emphasis added.)   The plain language of HRS §  641-2(b) 
prohibits an a ppellate court from accepting and considering new 
evidence.15  Here, Wilmington filed a Motion to Dismiss and 
exhibits before the ICA, which the ICA accepted and considered.   
In particular,  the ICA noted that  “Wilmington submit[ted] 
                     
15  Although Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes § 641-2(b) states that “no new 
evidence shall be taken in the supreme court,” this court has previously 
noted that “no new evidence shall be taken in the [appellate] court.”

(2010)); see also  Garcia v. Fernandez , 146 Hawaiʻi 627, 463 P.3d 1284 at *1

17 declarations and exhibit s with its motion [to dismiss ] to show 
that it sold and conveyed the property to BBNY, that a Special 
Warranty Deed was recorded on January 4, 2022, and a Corrective 
Special Warranty Deed was recorded on March 7, 2022, both in the 
Land Court.”  However, th e attachments to Wilmington’s Motion to 
Dismiss were never presented to the circuit court and were not 
part of the record on appeal because  Wilmington sold the 
Property to BBNY after the Domingos filed the notices of 
appeal.16  Thus, the ICA improperly resolved a disputed issue of 
fact and dismissed the Domingos’ appeal based on new evidence  
not contained within the record on appeal.   Instead, the ICA 
should have temporarily remanded the case to the circuit court  
for an evidentiary hearing  to determine whether BBNY was a 
third-party, good -faith purchaser.  
2. Hawaiʻi case law  
As Wilmington points out,17 the ICA relied on  Onaga to 
conclude that a remand was not necessary to determine whether 
                     
16  The Domingos filed both notices of appeal in 2018, and Wilmington did 
not sell the Proper ty to BBNY until around December 2021.  Thus, evidence 
that BBNY purchased the Property was not part of the record in the instant 
case until Wilmington filed the Motion to Dismiss in the ICA.  
 
17  It appears that the Domingos mistakenly note that the ICA  relied on DB 
Private Wealth Mortg., Ltd. v. Bouley , 138 Hawaiʻi 141, 377 P.3d 1059 (App. 
2016) in considering Wilmington’s new evidence on appeal and determining that 
BBNY was a third -party, good -faith purchaser.  Instead, the ICA relied on 
Bouley to determine that BBNY was a third -party, good -faith purchaser despite 
purchasing the Property from Wilmington instead of directly from the 
foreclosure sale.  *** NOT F

18 BBNY was a third -party, good -faith purchaser.  In a foo tnote, 
the ICA stated  
 The Domingos also argue that the matter must be 
remanded to the Circuit Court for an evidentiary hearing to 
determine whether BBNY is a good -faith purchaser because 
“[t]his Court is not a court where evidence can be taken.”  
However,  in Onaga, the Ferraras  intervened while the case 
was on appeal and moved to dismiss, asserting the appeal 
was moot because they had purchased the property.  140 
Hawaiʻi at 360, 400 P.3d at 561.  The Hawaiʻi Supreme Court 
determined the appeal was moot wit hout remanding to the 
circuit court for fact finding.  Id. 
However, the ICA’s reliance on Onaga was misplaced.  
In Onaga, the Circuit Court of the First Circuit  
granted Bank of New York Mellon’s (BONY) motion for summary 
judgment for foreclosure against  Onaga.  140 Hawaiʻi at 360-62, 
400 P.3d at 56 0-63.  Onaga filed an initial appeal (CAAP -13-
2287), “challenging the circuit court’s order granting BONY’s 
motion for summary judgment .”  Id. at 362, 400 P.3d at 563.  The 
Ferraras, who were initially not a par ty to the foreclosure 
action, purchased the property at a public auction, which the 
circuit court confirmed.  Id.  Onaga then appealed from the 
circuit court’s order confirming the sale of the property to the 
Ferraras (CAAP-14-426, the second appeal).  Id.  While the 
second appeal was pending, the ICA issued an SDO in Onaga’s 
first appeal vacating the circuit court’s order granting BONY’s 
motion for summary judgment.  Id. at 363, 400 P.3d at 564.  
  The Ferr aras then intervened in the second appeal and 
filed a motion to dismiss, noting that Onaga failed to obtain a *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
19 stay or post a supersedeas bond pending appeal.  Id.  The ICA 
denied that motion and the Ferr aras filed a second motion to 
dismiss, attaching a certificate of title, commissioner’s deed, 
and mortga ge executed by the Ferr aras and recorded in land 
court.  Id.  The ICA took judicial notice of the three 
attachments to the Ferr aras’ second motion to dismiss, bu t 
concluded  Onaga’s appeal was not moot.  Id. at 364, 400 P.3d at 
565. 
  On certiorari,  this court did not directly address the 
issue of whether an appellate court can consider new evidence on 
appeal to determine if a party is a third -party, good -faith 
purchaser , as no party raised that issue .  Id. at 364-70, 400 
P.3d at 565 -70.  Rather, thi s court determined  that Onaga’s 
appeal was moot because the Ferr aras’ certificate of title  
“conclusively established [their] title to the property.”  Id. 
at 368, 400 P.3d at 569.  In addition , this court stated  in a 
footnote:  “[w]hen the Ferr aras purchased  the Prop erty, the 
circuit court had already determined in the consolidated 
proceedings that BONY had a first priority lien on the Property.  
Thus, at the time of the purchase, there would not have been an 
‘infirmity in the title ’ based on Onaga’s mortgage .”  Id. at 367 
n.13, 400 P.3d at 568 n.13 . 
  Here, although Wilmington correctly points out that 
the Onaga court determined that an appeal was moot without a *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
20 remand to the circuit court , Onaga is distinguishable from this 
case for two reasons.  
  First, the Ferr aras purchased the property at issue in 
Onaga from a public auction and the circuit court confirmed the 
Ferraras’ purchase of the property.  Id. at 362, 400 P.3d at 
563.  It thus appears that the Ferr aras’ purchase of the 
property was contained wi thin the record on appeal, and no party 
contested that the Ferr aras purchased the property in good 
faith.  See id.  Here, Wilmington purchased the property from 
the foreclosure auction and later sold it to BBNY  while the 
Domingos’ appeal was pending .  In addition, the Domingos 
explicitly argued that BBNY did not purchase the property in 
good faith.  Thus, in contrast to Onaga, evidence that a third -
party had purchased the property in good faith was presented for 
the first time in the ICA when Wilmington fil ed its Motion to 
Dismiss.  Moreover, the Ferr aras were the third -party in Onaga 
and purchased the property at a  foreclosure auction, while 
mortgagee Wilmington purchased the property at the foreclosure 
auction in the instant case.  
  Second, the Ferr aras had a certificate of title 
demonstrating that they owned the property , which this court 
focused on to determine that Onaga’s appeal was moot .  Id. at 
364-69, 400 P.3d at 566 -70.  Here, the certificate of title 
Wilmington presented with its Motion to Dismiss states that *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
21 /s/ Mark E. Recktenwald Wilmington was the owner of the Property.  In contrast to Onaga, 
Wilmington did not provide a certificate of title that 
conclusively established BBNY had title to the property.  Id. at 
368, 400 P.3d at 569.   Thus, the instant case is distingu ishable 
from Onaga and the ICA mistakenly relied on Onaga to dismiss the 
Domingos’ appeal as moot.  
IV. CONCLUSION  
For the foregoing reasons, the ICA’s  August 26, 2022 
Amended SDO is vacated and the case is remanded to the  ICA with 
instructions to temporarily r emand the case to the circuit court 
for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether BBNY is a third-
party, good -faith purchaser.
