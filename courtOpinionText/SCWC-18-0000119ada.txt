I. INTRODUCTION 
This case involves the failure of employer, County of 
Hawaiʻi, Departme
nt of Water Supply, and its adjuster,   
 
 
     
    
 
  
 
  
   
 
 
   
 
 
 
  
 
  
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(collectively the County) to make timely payments of temporary 
total disability (TTD) benefits to employee, Delbert P. Costa, 
Jr., after he suffered a workplace injury. 
It is uncontested that TTD benefits were due Costa for 
the relevant periods. 
The question before this court is whether 
Costa is entitled to receive penalty payments arising from the County’s failure to timely pay TTD benefits as required under 
Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386-92 (Supp. 1996).  The County 
offers two rationales for why such a penalty is inappropriate. 
First, the County argues that no penalty can be levied because 
“TTD benefits were not ordered by the Director until [the] 
April 25, 2014 [supplemental decision.]” Second, the County argues that because it “disputed liability for the work injury in 
its initial report,” it was protected from incurring any future 
penalty for late payments. We reject both of these arguments. 
Based on the plain reading of HRS § 386-92, the 
statutory scheme of 
Hawaiʻi workers’ compensation laws, and its 
legislative history, we hold that a penalty may be properly imposed where an employer or its carrier fails to make timely TTD 
benefit payments where liability is not denied and there is no 
question that compensation is due the injured worker. 
II. BACKGROUND 
On May 9, 2012, Delbert Costa suffered a stress injury 
while employed by the County.  Costa reported the injury to the 
2   
 
 
  
 
 
 
    
  
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
County on May 9, 2012, and the County filed an industrial injury 
claim on September 19, 2012.  The County completed a WC-1 
“Employer’s Report of Industrial Injury” contesting 
compensability pending investigation and a medical examination, 
which found the injury was not work-related.  The County did not 
contest that TTD benefits would be due Costa if the injury was 
determined to be compensable. In a letter dated October 31, 
2012, the County informed Costa that, “[i]f the claim is found to be compensable, payment of benefits will be made pursuant to 
Chapter 386 and the Hawaii Workers’ Compensation Medical Fee 
Schedule.” 
On December 7, 2012, Costa filed a WC-5 “Employee’s 
Claim for Workers’ Compensation Benefits” asserting he suffered 
from “stress causing physical & mental ailments” following 
“multiple incidents over past 5-6 [years] regarding job position 
assignments[,] being overlooked, causing extreme distress 
continuing to progress to heath illness.” A disability compensation hearing was convened on April 23, 2013, to determine 
inter alia whether the claim was compensable.
1 
On June 24, 2013, the Director of the Department of 
Labor and Industrial Relations, Disability Compensation Division 
1 At this hearing, the County only contested the cause of Costa’s 
injury and not the fact that he had sustained an injury and was disabled. The 
County argued that Costa’s injury was due to a personnel matter rather than 
from the performance of his job duties. 
3   
 
 
   
 
 
  
  
   
     
 
  
 
  
 
 
  
 
  
    
   
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(Director) rendered a decision (the Director’s decision) finding 
that the County had “failed to provide substantial evidence to 
overcome the presumption [of compensability,]” and concluding 
that Costa “suffered a personal injury (stress) on 5/9/2012 
arising out of and in the course of employment.” The Director’s 
decision also determined Costa’s average weekly wages. Pursuant 
to HRS §§ 386-21 (Supp. 2009) and 386-26 (Supp. 2006), the 
Director ordered the County to pay “such medical care, service and supplies as the nature of the injury may require.” The 
Director’s decision further noted “[t]he matters of average 
weekly wages, temporary disability, permanent disability and/or 
disfigurement, if any, shall be determined at a later date.” The 
County did not appeal the decision and did not pay TTD benefits 
to Costa.  
On August 12, 2013, Costa applied for a second hearing 
before the Disability Compensation Division to determine the 
issue of nonpayment of TTD benefits.  Costa argued that because the County did not appeal the Director’s decision, TTD benefits 
were due and payable, and a penalty for late payment of these 
benefits was appropriate pursuant to HRS § 386-92. 
At the County’s request, the Director ordered Costa to 
appear for an independent psychological evaluation by a provider 
of the County’s choosing as provided in HRS § 386-79 (Supp. 
4   
 
 
   
  
  
   
 
 
  
 
 
    
 
  
  
    
 
      
  
  
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
1996). The independent psychological evaluation administered by 
Dr. Rogers took place on December 17, 2013.  
The disability compensation hearing requested by Costa 
on the issue of nonpayment of TTD benefits was held on February 
25, 2014. At the hearing, the County relied on the results of 
the independent psychological evaluation to contest the 
compensability of TTD benefits, arguing that the disability was 
due to Costa’s preexisting traits and not his work duties. 
After the hearing, the Director issued a supplemental 
decision on April 25, 2014, (the Director’s supplemental decision) finding, inter alia, that the County’s “objection . . . 
that the 6/24/2013 decision determined that [TTD] was to be 
determined at a later date is without merit since the 6/24/2013 
decision was rendered finding the claim for stress compensable.  
Without appeal of said decision, employer obstructed benefits 
payable to the claimant.”  The Director’s supplemental decision 
awarded Costa TTD benefits for various periods, starting from May 14, 2012, in the amount of $21,389.18.
2 The Director also imposed 
a 20% penalty on the County for late payment of TTD benefits under HRS § 386-92, totaling $4,277.84. 
2 From May 14, 2012, through June 4, 2012, and from August 15, 2012, 
through January 7, 2013, Costa was awarded TTD benefits in the amount of 
$15,996.24. Additionally, from January 8, 2013, through December 17, 2013, 
Costa received TTD benefits under a prior shoulder injury.  Thus, for these 
weeks of concurrent disability, the Director found the County was liable for 
the difference in the compensation rates, amounting to $5,392.94. 
5   
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
On May 7, 2014, the County appealed the Director’s 
supplemental decision to the Labor and Industrial Relations 
Appeals Board (LIRAB) and filed a motion for partial stay of TTD 
benefits and the penalty. The LIRAB granted the County’s motion 
in part, only staying the assessment of penalties. 
On January 31, 2018, the LIRAB reversed the Director’s 
supplemental decision. Applying the plain language of HRS 
§§ 386-31(b) (Supp. 2005) and 386-92 and the legislative purpose 
as discussed in 
Panoke v. Reef Development of Hawaiʻi, Inc.
, 136 
Hawaiʻi 448, 363 P.3d 296 (2015), the LIRAB found that “TTD 
benefits were not due or payable under HRS § 386-31(b) prior to 
the Director’s June 24, 2013 final decision on compensability. 
Accordingly, under HRS § 386-92, there is no statutory basis for 
a penalty against Employer for non-payment of TTD [benefits] prior to June 24, 2013.” 
As for the penalties assessed for the County’s 
nonpayment of TTD benefits after the Director’s decision, the 
LIRAB concluded that, because Costa had been disabled under a 
previous shoulder injury and the County paid TTD benefits for the 
period from January 8, 2013, to December 13, 2013, the penalty 
should not have been imposed by the Director for Costa’s May 9, 
2012 stress injury. 
For the periods from May 14, 2012, to 
June 4, 2012, and August 15, 2012, to January 7, 2013, the LIRAB 
found no statutory basis to assess the penalty under HRS 
6   
 
 
    
 
   
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
§ 386-92, finding that the County had a reasonable basis to 
challenge liability for payment of the TTD benefits based on 
Dr. Rogers’ independent psychological evaluation. Notably, that 
evaluation occurred after the Director’s decision had determined 
the compensability of Costa’s stress injury. 
The LIRAB Chair dissented, arguing that, after the 
Director’s decision, the compensability of Costa’s injury could  
no longer be denied and the County “was then required to comply   
with its statutory duty (‘shall pay’) under HRS Section  386-31(b), for the prompt payment for TTD benefits within ten 
(10)  days of the Employer being notified of the disability, 
without waiting for decision [sic] from the Director.”  The Chair   
further reasoned that the County “did not have any medical basis      
to support its position that [Costa] was not entitled to TTD . . . until receipt of [the independent psychological evaluation]    
on January 14, 2014.”  Therefore, since the TTD benefits were  
“untimely and/or unpaid” for the period from May 14, 2012 through  
June 4, 2012 and from August 15, 2012 through December 17, 2013,  
the Chair “conclude[d] that [the County] is subject to payment of   
a 20% penalty in the amount of $4,277.84, pursuant to HRS Section  
386-92, for [the relevant] periods[.]”      (Emphasis omitted.)    
Costa appealed the LIRAB’s decision to the Intermediate 
Court of Appeals (ICA). The ICA affirmed, although it held (1) the LIRAB’s decision and order erroneously applied the “clear and 
7   
 
 
  
  
  
  
 
 
   
 
   
  
  
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
convincing” evidentiary standard, instead of the required 
“preponderance of the evidence” standard set out in HRS 
§ 91-10(5) (2012), and (2) the LIRAB erred in “concluding that 
HRS § 386-92 is punitive rather than remedial in nature.”  
However, according to the ICA, Costa’s rights were not prejudiced 
as a consequence of these errors. The ICA agreed with the 
LIRAB’s finding that the Director’s decision ordered only 
compensation for medical costs pursuant to HRS §§ 386-21 and 386-26, but deferred a determination on average weekly wages and TTD 
benefits to a later date. Thus, the ICA reasoned the record did 
not support the imposition of a penalty. 
Costa applied for a writ of certiorari, and we accepted 
his application. 
III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. The LIRAB’s Decision 
Appellate review of agency decisions is governed by the  
Hawaiʻi Administr ative Procedure Act.  HRS § 91-14(g) (2012),  
“Judicial review of contested cases” provides:  
Upon review of the record the court may affirm the 
decision of the agency or remand the case with instructions 
for further proceedings; or it may reverse or modify the 
decision and order if the substantial rights of the 
petitioners may have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, conclusions, decisions, or orders 
are:  
(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; or 
(2) In excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction of 
the agency; or 
8   
 
   
  
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure; or 
(4) Affected by other error of law; or 
(5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, 
and substantial evidence on the whole record; or 
(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion. 
“Under HRS § 91-14(g), conclusions of law are 
reviewable under subsections (1), (2), and (4); questions 
regarding procedural defects under subsection (3); findings of 
fact under subsection (5); and an agency’s exercise of discretion 
under subsection (6).” United Pub. Workers, AFSCME, Local 646,
AFL-CIO v. Hanneman, 106 Hawaiʻ i 359, 363, 105 P.3d 236, 240 
(2005) (brackets omitted) (quoting Paul’s Elec. Serv., Inc. v. 
Befitel, 104 Hawaiʻ i 412, 416, 91 P.3d 494, 498 (2004)). 
B. The LIRAB’s Statutory Interpretation 
Appellate courts generally review questions of 
statutory interpretation de novo. Gillan v. Gov’t Emps. Ins.
Co., 119 Hawaiʻ i 109, 114, 194 P.3d 1071, 1076 (2008). “[W]here 
the language of the law is plain and unambiguous, courts must 
give effect to the law according to its plain and obvious 
meaning.” Mikelson v. United Servs. Auto. Ass’n, 108 Hawaiʻ i 358, 
360, 120 P.3d 257, 259 (2005) (internal quotations and citations 
omitted). 
However, where a statute’s language is ambiguous, the 
appellate court must “defer to the agency’s expertise and . . . follow the agency’s construction of the statute unless that 
9   
 
  
 
   
 
 
   
    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
construction is palpably erroneous.” Panoke , 136 Hawaiʻi at 461, 
363 P.3d at 309 (quoting 
Vail v. Emps.’ Ret. Sys., 75 Haw. 42, 
66, 856 P.2d 1227, 1240 (1993)). 
IV. DISCUSSION 
Costa raises two issues before this court: 
1. Whether the ICA gravely erred by not properly applying 
the legislative intent and purpose in use of WC- 1 forms 
by employers and which interpretation failed to compensate [Costa] for delays in temporary disability 
benefits contrary to the remedial nature of the statute as recognized by this Court? 
2. Whether the ICA’s conclusion [that Costa] was not entitled to penalties under [HRS] Section 386- 92 . . . 
is inconsistent with this Court’s decision in Panoke. . . . 
Neither party contests that TTD benefits were owed for 
the relevant periods. The sole question then is whether, under 
HRS § 386-92, the ICA and the LIRAB erred in overturning the 
Director’s imposition of a penalty for failure to timely pay TTD benefits. 
Costa advances two arguments in favor of imposing a 
penalty. First, Costa argues that a penalty was appropriate 
because the statutory scheme requires payment of TTD benefits if 
a finding of compensability is not appealed, without need to wait 
for a separate decision on TTD. Second, Costa asserts that the 
ICA and the LIRAB misconstrued this Court’s holding in Panoke to mean that “an employer in every situation will never be subject 
to a penalty under Section 386-92, HRS, if it initially 
controverted the claim.” 
10   
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The County counters that a penalty was not appropriate 
because “TTD benefits [for the relevant periods] were not ordered 
by the Director until April 25, 2014, and [the County] disputed 
liability for the work injury in its initial report[.]” The 
County argues that a plain reading of HRS § 386-92 supports its 
position. 
We disagree. 
A. Disputing Liability at the Outset Does Not Create an 
Indefinite “Safe Harbor” Under HRS § 386-92 
We begin with the County’s contention that penalties 
may not be levied for failure to timely pay TTD benefits because 
the County “disputed liability for the work injury in its initial 
report[.]” In essence, the County asks this court to construe 
HRS § 386-31(b) to provide an indefinite safe harbor for 
employers to delay TTD benefit payments that are initially 
controverted. As discussed below, we reject this approach as it 
would lead to an absurd result that is in conflict with the plain 
language, legislative intent, and remedial nature of HRS §§ 386-31(b) and 386-92. 
1. The liberal construction of Hawaiʻ i workers’ 
compensation laws supports the imposition of penalties 
Hawaiʻi
 courts ha
ve consistently recognized the 
importance of a liberal construction to give effect to our 
workers’ compensation laws. See, e.g.
, In re Palama, 34 Haw. 65, 
67 (Haw. Terr. 1937) (“The great purpose of [workers’ 
11   
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
compensation laws] . . . is to provide means for compensating the 
employee for pecuniary loss arising out of his disability to 
work, and to accomplish that purpose the statute should receive a 
liberal construction.”). As this court explained in Davenport v.
City & County of Honolulu, 
It is well- established in Hawaiʻ i that chapter 386 is social 
legislation that is to be interpreted broadly. The 
legislature has chosen to treat work- related injuries as a 
cost of production to be borne by industry. Accordingly, 
chapter 386 is construed liberally in favor of coverage 
providing compensation for an employee for all work connected 
injuries, regardless of questions of negligence and proximate 
cause. 
100 Hawaiʻi 481, 491, 60 P.3d 882, 892 (2002) (internal citations 
and quotations omitted). 
Hawaiʻi workers’ 
compensation laws are “highly remedial 
in character. Their paramount purpose is to provide compensation 
for an employee for all work-connected injuries, regardless of 
questions of negligence and proximate cause.” Flor v. Holguin
, 
94 Hawaiʻi 70, 79, 9 P.3d 382, 391 (2000) (quoting 
Evanson v. 
Univ. of Haw., 52 Haw. 595, 600, 483 P.2d 187, 191 (1971)). As 
this court has explained, our workers’ compensation laws 
“represent a socially enforced bargain: the employee giving up his right to recover common law damages from the employer in 
exchange for the certainty of a statutory award for all work-
connected injuries.” Van Ness v. State Dep’t of Educ.
, 131 
Hawaiʻi 545, 558, 319 P.3d 464, 477 (2014) (quoting 
Evanson, 52 
Haw. at 598, 483 P.2d at 190). “[T]he slightest aggravation or

acceleration of an injury by the employment activity mandates 
compensation.” Korsak v. Hawaiʻ i Permanente Med. Grp., 94 Hawaiʻ i 
297, 305, 12 P.3d 1238, 1246 (2000) (quoting DeFries v. Ass’n of 
Owners, 999 Wilder, 57 Haw. 296, 308, 555 P.2d 855, 862 (1976). 
To give effect to this broad purpose, “[t]he workers’ 
compensation statute[3] rests on the presumption that a claimed 
injury is work-connected and therefore compensable.” Cadiz v.
QSI, Inc., 148 Hawaiʻ i 96, 107, 468 P.3d 110, 121 (2020) (citation 
omitted). 
2. The plain language of HRS § 386-92 supports the 
imposition of penalties 
The plain language of HRS § 386-92 supports imposing a 
penalty on the County for failure to pay TTD benefits due Costa. 
HRS § 386-92, “Default in payments of compensation, penalty” 
provides: 
If any compensation payable under the terms of a final 
decision or judgment is not paid by a self- insured employer 
or an insurance carrier within thirty- one days after it 
becomes due, as provided by the final decision or judgment, 
or if any temporary total disability benefits are not paid by 
the 
3 HRS § 386- 85 (1993) provides in relevant part that: 
In any proceeding for the enforcement of a claim for 
compensation under this chapter it shall be presumed, in the 
absence of substantial evidence to the contrary:  
(1) That the claim is for a covered work injury[.] 
13   
 
  
 
 
  
   
  
 
 
   
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
employer or carrier within ten days, exclusive of Saturdays, 
Sundays, and holidays, after the employer or carrier has been 
notified of the disability, and where the right to benefits 
are not controverted in the employer's initial report of 
industrial injury or where temporary total disability 
benefits are terminated in violation of section 386- 31, there 
shall be added to the unpaid compensation an amount equal to twenty per cent thereof payable at the same time as, but in 
addition to, the compensation, unless the nonpayment is 
excused by the director after a showing by the employer or 
insurance carrier that the payment of the compensation could not be made on the date prescribed therefor owing to the 
conditions over which the employer or carrier had no control. 
(Emphases added.) 
On its face, the plain language of HRS § 386-92 
requires (“shall”) the imposition of a 20% penalty when, after 10 
days of receiving notice of a disability, an employer fails to 
pay TTD benefit to the injured employee unless the employer 
controverted “the right to benefits” in its initial report.  4
Here, the County controverted whether Costa’s 
disability was work-related, and thus not compensable, in its initial report. However, the County did not appeal the 
Director’s decision finding Costa’s injury compensable.  Thus, 
5
4 The record shows that Costa provided oral notice of his stress 
injury to his supervisor on May 9, 2012. An employer is required to file a WC-
1 form within seven working days after becoming aware of an injury causing a 
worker to be absent from work for one day or more. HRS § 386- 95 (Supp. 2002). 
The WC-1 filed by the County was dated September 19, 2012, more than three 
months after Costa first reported his injury to the County. 
The Director found, however, that Costa did not report his May 9, 2012 
injury to the County until September 18, 2012, the day before the County filed its September 19, 2012 report. Because this finding of fact has not been 
challenged on appeal, it is binding on this court. Nevertheless, we note this potential issue for guidance to employers and to the bar going forward. 
5 The County did not controvert the disability again until it sought 
an independent evaluation under HRS § 386- 79 in October 2013. 
14   
 
  
 
     
    
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
under HRS § 386-87 (1993), the Director’s decision became “final 
and conclusive between the parties” after the relevant statutory 
period ended.6 
The County essentially asks this court to read HRS 
§ 386-92 as creating an indefinite safe harbor, whereby an 
employer may withhold uncontroverted TTD benefits indefinitely 
without incurring a penalty, provided they controverted the 
disability at the outset of the claim. The plain language of the statute does not compel such a reading. Instead, the statute on 
its face clearly contemplates withholding payment of TTD benefits 
only where such benefits are actively controverted, and not where 
such benefits were previously but are no longer controverted. 
This reading is confirmed by the use of the present, 
and not a past tense: “where the right to such benefits are not 
controverted in the employer’s initial report of industrial 
injury.” HRS § 386-92 (emphasis added). 
To hold otherwise would lead to an absurd result or 
otherwise negate the very purpose of the statute.  See Tauese v.
Dep’t of Labor & Indus. Rels., 113 Hawaiʻ i 1, 31, 147 P.3d 785, 
815 (2006) (requiring courts “to construe statutes so as to avoid absurd results”) (citation omitted); City & Cnty. of Honolulu v. 
6 HRS § 386- 87(a) provides in relevant part that “[a] decision of 
the director shall be final and conclusive between the parties . . . unless 
within twenty days after a copy has been sent to each party, either party 
appeals therefrom to the appellate board[.]”

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Hsiung, 109 Hawaiʻi 159, 173, 124 P.3d 434, 448 (2005) (rejecting 
statutory interpretations that “render[] any part of the 
statutory language a nullity”). 
This plain language reading of HRS § 386-92 is further 
confirmed by the broader statutory scheme of HRS chapter 386, as well as the chapter’s legislative history. 
3. The statutory scheme of HRS chapter 386 supports the 
imposition of penalties 
When HRS § 386-92 is read in the context of HRS chapter 
386, it becomes clear that the County was not permitted to 
withhold payment of uncontroverted TTD benefits without incurring 
a penalty. 
In keeping with the presumption of compensability for 
workers’ compensation claims, HRS chapter 386 envisions employers paying TTD benefits to disabled employees without delay. 
For 
example, HRS § 386-31(b), “Temporary total disability,” provides in relevant part: 
The employer shall pay temporary total disability 
benefits promptly as they accrue to the person entitled 
thereto without waiting for a decision from the director, 
unless this right is controverted by the employer in the employer’ s initial report of industrial injury.  The first
payment of benefits shall become due and shall be paid no later than on the tenth day after the employer has been 
notified of the occurrence of the total disability, and 
thereafter the benefits due shall be paid weekly[.] 
(Emphases added.) 
By requiring employers to not delay in paying TTD 
benefits prior to a definitive adjudication by the Director as to 
16   
 
   
 
     
 
  
  
     
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
their entitlement to TTD benefits, HRS chapter 386 envisions 
paying benefits to employees whose disability may in fact not be 
compensable. Where an employer pays TTD benefits to an employee 
for a disability that is later determined to be not compensable, 
HRS § 386-52 (1993) provides for those payments to “be deducted 
from the amount payable as compensation” either “by shortening 
the period during which the compensation must be paid, or by 
reducing the total amount for which the employer is liable[.]”7 
HRS § 386-52(a) & (a)(2); see also Hawaiʻ i Administrative Rules 
(HAR) § 12-10-24 (eff. 1981).8 However, “[i]f overpayment cannot 
be credited, the director shall order the claimant to reimburse the employer.” HRS § 386-52(a)(3). 
Payment of TTD benefits, once begun, cannot be 
terminated except “upon order of the director or if the employee is able to resume work.” HRS § 386-31(b). Otherwise, benefits 
7 HRS § 386-52(a)(1) includes a notice requirement that provides: 
The employer notifies the injured employee and the director in 
writing of any such credit request stating the reasons for 
such credit and informing the injured employee that the 
employee has the right to file a written request for a hearing 
to submit any evidence to dispute such a credit[.] 
8 HAR § 12-10-24 provides: 
For the purpose of section 386- 52(a), HRS, an employer may, 
with the approval of the director, deduct from an amount payable as compensation any advance payments made to the injured employee if the employee had been notified in writing 
at the time the advance was made that the payments were in 
lieu of compensation. 
17   
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
may only be terminated following notice to the employee and an 
opportunity to be heard: 
When the employer is of the opinion that temporary total  
disability benefits should be terminated because the injured 
employee is able to resume work, the employer shall notify the employee and the director in writing of an intent to 
terminate the benefits at least two weeks prior to the date 
when the last payment is to be made. The notice shall give 
the reason for stopping payment and shall inform the employee 
that the employee may make a written request to the director for a hearing if the employee disagrees with the employer. 
Upon receipt of the request from the employee, the director 
shall conduct a hearing as expeditiously as possible and 
render a prompt decision [awarding or denying compensation 
within 60 days].  
HRS § 386-31(b). 
Thus again, even where benefits should be rightfully 
terminated by an employer because the temporary disability has 
ended, HRS § 386-31(b) envisions the employer continuing to pay benefits for a minimum of two weeks. 
The employer would then 
need to seek reimbursement from the employee under HRS § 386-52. HRS chapter 386 thus evinces a preference, in keeping with the 
liberal construction discussed supra, toward employers presuming 
compensability, paying TTD benefits initially and without delay, 
and only then seeking recovery of unmerited payments after the 
fact. 
An employer’s failure to comply with the requirements 
of HRS § 386-31(b), either by failing to promptly pay out TTD benefits or by improperly terminating TTD benefit payments is 
subject to penalty under both HRS §§ 386-31(b) and 386-92: “[a]n 
employer or insurance carrier who fails to comply with this 
18

section shall pay not more than $2,500 into the special 
compensation fund upon the order of the director, in addition to 
other penalties prescribed in section 386-92.”  HRS § 386-31(b). 
To read HRS § 386-92 to permit an employer to contest 
the compensability of a disability and then delay the payment of 
TTD benefits – even after a determination that the disability is 
compensable – would lead to an absurd result, especially 
considering the larger statutory context of chapter 386. 
4. The legislative history of HRS chapter 386 supports the 
imposition of penalties 
This interpretation of HRS §§ 386-31(b) and -92 is also 
confirmed by the legislative history of these statutes. 
In 1969, HRS § 97-30(b), the then-controlling workers 
compensation law equivalent to HRS § 386-31(b), was amended to 
“compel the prompt payment of temporary total disability 
benefits.” 9 S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 268, in 1969 Senate 
Journal, at 988. The legislature recognized that “it is vitally 
9 Prior to the 1969 amendment, HRS § 97-30(b) (Supp. 1963) provided: 
Where a work injury causes total disability not 
determined to be permanent in character, the employer, for 
the duration of such disability but not including the first 
two days thereof shall pay the injured employee a weekly 
benefit at the rate of sixty- six and two- thirds per cent of 
his average weekly wages, but not more than $75 nor less than $18 a week, or, if his average weekly wages are less than $18 
a week, at the rate of one hundred per cent of his average 
weekly wages. In case the total disability exceeds seven 
days, the compensation shall be allowed from the date of such 
disability. 
(. . . continued)

important that the benefits be paid immediately upon its accrual 
to replace the loss of wages caused by the work injury.” H. 
Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 178, in 1969 House Journal, at 694. 
In 1971, HRS § 386-92 was amended to permit the 
Director to impose a penalty on employers that failed to make 
timely TTD benefit payments to injured employees.10 The 
(continued . . .) 
The 1969 amendment added the following paragraph to § 97- 30(b): 
Temporary total disability benefits shall be paid 
promptly as it accrues  and directly t
o the person entitled 
thereto without waiting for a decision from the director, 
unless the right to the benefits is controverted by the 
employer. The first payment of benefits shall become due and 
shall be paid no later than on the tenth day after the 
employer has been notified of the occurrence of the total disability,  and thereafter the benefits due shall be paid 
weekly except as otherwise authorized pursuant to section 97-52.  
1969 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 18, § 1 at 25 
(emphasis added). 
10 Originally codified as HRS § 97-101 in 1963, HRS § 386-92 (Supp. 
1973) was amended in 1971 to provide: 
If any compensation payable under the terms of a final 
decision or judgment is not paid by a self- insured employer 
or an insurance carrier within thirty- one days after it 
becomes due, as provided by such final decision or judgment, or if  any temporary total disability benefits are not paid by 
said employer or carrier within ten days, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, after being notified of the 
disability, and where the right to said benefits are  not 
controverted,  there shall  be added to the unpaid compensation 
an amount equal to ten per cent thereof payable at the same 
time as, but in addition to, the compensation, unless the 
nonpayment is excused by the director  of labor and industrial 
relations  after a showing by said employer or  insurance 
carrier  that the payment of the compensation could not be 
made on the date prescribed therefor owing to the conditions 
over which he had no control.

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
legislature recognized that prior to the amendment, “[t]he law 
[did] not provide a remedy for the effective enforcement of the 
[benefit] provision.” S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 216, in 1971 
Senate Journal, at 878; H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 757, in 1971 
House Journal, at 1007. The penalty was adopted to create such 
an enforcement mechanism. 
Subsequent amendments to HRS chapter 386 also support 
this reading. For example, in 1979, the legislature again evinced its intent to ensure timely payment of TTD benefits when 
it amended HRS chapter 386 by “providing a procedure which would 
enable an injured worker to have a prompt determination on his 
right[s]” where such payments had been unilaterally terminated by 
the employer. H. Stand Comm. Rep. No. 834, in 1979 House 
Journal, at 1551. 
And again, in 1995, the penalty for late TTD benefit 
payments was increased from 10% to 20% as part of a package of 
reforms meant to improve the efficiency of our workers’ compensation scheme. H. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 112, in 1995 House 
Journal, at 1005-07; H. Stand Comm. Rep. No.575, in 1995 House 
Journal, at 1241-44.  In reforming the workers’ compensation 
statutes, the legislature expressed its intent was “to enable the 
injured worker to receive timely and the most effective medical 
treatment and rehabilitation.” H. Stand Comm. Rep. No. 575, in 
1995 House Journal, at 1242. 
21   
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The legislative history of the relevant sections of HRS 
chapter 386 does not support a reading that permits an employer 
to delay payments indefinitely after an injury was determined to 
be compensable, regardless of whether or not compensability was 
initially challenged, as argued by the County. Instead, read as 
a whole, the legislative history clearly indicates the 
legislature’s intent for injured workers to receive prompt 
payment of TTD benefits when due. 
5. Distinguishing Panoke 
Our decision in Panoke does not require a different 
outcome. The Panoke
 court considered inter alia whether the 
LIRAB erred in denying a penalty for delayed payments of TTD 
benefits to an injured worker. 136 Hawaiʻi at 466-68, 363 P.3d at 
314-316. There, we held that “[b]ecause coverage for [the 
employee’s] injuries was still in dispute for the period [at 
issue], and payments for that period had not been subject to a final judgment, [the employer and its carrier] are not liable for 
additional penalties under HRS § 386-92.” 
Id.
 at 468, 363 P.3d 
at 316. 
In Panoke, the employee filed an initial injury report 
when he injured his back on the job; his employer did not controvert the claim. Id. at 451, 363 P.3d at 299. However, 
several weeks later, the employee filed a second injury report, complaining of pain in his shoulders, which he attributed to his 
22   
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
injury. Id.His employer controverted liability for this second 
injury report, contending that the pain in his shoulders resulted 
not from his work injury but from when the employee broke his 
shoulders in a scooter accident. Id. at 452, 363 P.3d at 300. 
After a hearing, the director found the injuries were compensable. Id. at 453, 363 P.3d at 301. The employer 
immediately appealed. Id.
In considering whether, on these facts, the ICA erred 
in declining to assess a penalty against the employer, this court 
explained that, under HRS § 386-92, the 20% penalty applies 
either (1) if the TTD benefits are not paid “within thirty-one 
days after it becomes due, as provided by the final decision or 
judgment” or (2) if TTD benefits are not paid “within ten days 
. . . after the employer or carrier has been notified of the 
disability, and where the right to benefits are not controverted 
in the employer's initial report of industrial injury[.]” Id. at 
467, 363 P.3d at 315 (quoting HRS § 386-92) On the Panoke facts, 
neither of those conditions were met. Id. at 468, 363 P.3d at 
316. 
First, we noted that there was no “final and conclusive 
decision” within the meaning of HRS § 386-87. Id.Because the 
employer timely filed an appeal to the LIRAB, the Panoke 
director’s decision did not become final regarding the 
23   
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
compensability of work-related injuries for purposes of assessing 
a penalty for nonpayment. Id.
Second, we noted that the Panoke employer was not 
liable for a penalty for failure to make immediate payments 
“because the claim was still controverted.” Id.In the absence 
of a final judgment and an appeal before the LIRAB, liability for the injury remained in controversy throughout the period for 
which penalties were sought. Id.
Further, the Panoke court rejected the employee’s 
argument that a penalty was appropriate because the employer had failed to controvert liability in the initial injury report. Id.
This, we explained, would have been impossible as the controverted shoulder injury did not arise in the initial injury 
report. Id.
The facts here easily distinguish Panoke. Here, 
despite controverting the initial injury report, the County did 
not appeal the Director’s decision that Costa’s injuries were compensable. Thus, after the statutory twenty-day period 
provided for in HRS § 386-87, the Director’s decision became 
“final and conclusive” in the absence of an appeal to the LIRAB, 
triggering the County’s duty to pay TTD benefits. Failure to 
begin paying TTD benefits at the latest within thirty-one days of 
the decision becoming final would incur a penalty under HRS 
§ 386-92. Holding that penalties are appropriate on these facts 
24   
 
  
 
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
is consistent with our decision in Panoke, with the plain meaning 
of the statutory scheme, and with the policy concerns addressed 
by the legislature in crafting our workers’ compensation laws. 
Further, once the Director’s decision that Costa’s 
injuries were compensable became final, liability was no longer 
in controversy. Because compensability was not again 
controverted until the County sought an independent psychological 
evaluation, which was in all events after the period for which a penalty is here sought, the County could no longer shield itself 
from paying TTD benefits without incurring a penalty simply 
because it had initially controverted compensability. 
The County’s argument to that effect here is similar to 
the argument raised by the employee in Panoke and must be 
rejected on similar grounds. There, as discussed above, the 
employee argued that because the employer had not controverted 
the first of the two injury reports, it had waived its ability to 
challenge the second. Rejecting this argument, [this court], acknowledging the absurd result it would produce, reasoned: 
Holding that [the employer] had not controverted [the 
employee’s] shoulder injury for the purposes of HRS § 386-92, 
merely because they had not done so in the initial injury 
report . . . would have the effect of allowing employees to 
subsequently add any injuries to their claims and prevent their employers from controverting them without paying a 
penalty. 
Panoke, 136 Hawaiʻi at 468, 363 P.3d at 316. 
25   
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Here, the County asks this court to hold that by simply 
controverting the initial injury report, HRS § 386-92 was indefinitely satisfied for purposes of avoiding penalties for 
late TTD benefit payments. This reading of HRS § 386-92 would 
lead to an equally absurd result, allowing employers to 
controvert whether an injury was work related at the outset and 
then either not pay or delay indefinitely TTD benefits that are 
no longer in controversy. Because such a reading is contrary to the manifest legislative intent in providing for penalties “in 
cases where liability is not denied and there is no question that 
the compensation is due [to] the injured worker[,]” we reject 
this argument. S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 216, in 1971 Senate 
Journal, at 878; see also H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 757, in 1971 
House Journal, at 1007. 
For the reasons set out above, we hold that, consistent 
with the plain meaning of HRS § 386-92, the Director may properly 
impose a 20% penalty where an employer or its carrier fails to make timely TTD benefit payments in cases where compensability is 
no longer denied and there is no question that the compensation 
is due the injured worker.

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
B. A Blanket Reservation Clause Does Not Contravene Otherwise 
Final and Conclusive Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law 
Purporting to Determine Compensability and Award Benefits 
One final issue to be determined here is the impact of 
the reservation clause in the Director’s decision on the County’s 
duty to pay TTD benefits once compensability was established. 
The County argues that, even if they were not within 
the safe harbor created by controverting Costa’s claim under HRS § 386-31(b), the penalty under HRS § 386-92 is inappropriate 
because “TTD benefits were not ordered by the director until 
April 25, 2014[.]” In effect, the County argues that because the 
decision contained a blanket reservation clause which provided 
that “[t]he matters of average weekly wages, temporary 
disability, permanent disability and/or disfigurement, if any, 
shall be determined at a later date[,]” no payment was due until such a determination occurred at a later date. The County points 
to the Director’s supplemental decision, which explicitly ordered 
payment of TTD benefits under HRS § 386-31(b). 
In 
Bocalbos v. Kapi᷾olani  Medical Center
, 89 Hawaiʻi 
436, 437, 974 P.2d 1026, 1027 (1999) (per curiam), a workers’ 
compensation case involving a TTD benefits appeal before the 
LIRAB, this court held that LIRAB decisions and orders are final, 
appealable orders for purposes of HRS § 91-14, irrespective of 
27   
 
  
    
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the decision and order’s reservation clause. As we explained in 
Bocalbos: 
We take judicial notice, based on other workers’  
compensation cases that have been before us, that it is the 
standard practice of the director of labor in any decision awarding temporary disability benefits, regardless of the 
nature or extent of the injury, to state that “the matter of 
permanent disability and/or disfigurement, if any, shall be 
reserved for later determination.”  Such a blanket 
reservation clause, apparently made for the protection of the injured worker, should not be used to prevent timely 
appellate review of an otherwise final decision  on the 
matters of medical and temporary disability benefits.  
Id. at 443, 974 P.2d at 1033. 
The same reasoning applies here. Because chapter 386 
envisions injured workers receiving TTD benefits “promptly as 
they accrue,” we clarify that such a blanket reservation clause 
should not be used to prevent timely payment of TTD benefits that 
have been finally and conclusively determined to be due an 
injured employee. See HRS § 386-31(b). 
Once the period for appeal had lapsed and the 
Director’s determination on compensability became “final and conclusive between the parties” under HRS § 386-87, Costa was 
entitled to receive “a weekly benefit at the rate of sixty-six 
and two-thirds per cent of the employee’s average weekly wages,” 
pursuant to HRS § 386-31(b).
11 The uncontested findings of fact 
11 HRS § 386-31(b) provides in relevant part: 
Where a work injury causes total disability not 
determined to be permanent in character, the employer, for 
the duration of the disability, but not including the first 
three calendar days thereof, shall pay the injured employee a 
(. . . continued) 
28   
 
  
 
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
in the Director’s decision determined Costa’s average weekly 
wages to be $999.72. Contrary to the blanket reservation clause, 
the Director’s decision conclusively determined both that 
compensation was due and the amount Costa was entitled to 
receive. 
Finding the Director’s decision and order final and 
conclusive irrespective of a reservation clause is consistent 
with this court’s precedent and with the remedial nature of our 
workers’ compensation law. See Bocalbos, 89 Hawaiʻ i at 443, 974 
P.2d at 1033; Van Ness, 131 Hawaiʻ i at 558, 319 P.3d at 477. 
Further, this interpretation is consistent with the 
LIRAB’s recent decision and order, Seghorn v. Department of 
Transportation, where the LIRAB came to the opposite conclusion 
to the instant case on the applicability of the penalty for failure to pay TTD benefits. 2019 WL 5069081 (Oct. 9, 2019), 
aff’d
 154 Hawaiʻi 206, 549 P.3d 345, 2024 WL 2797391 (App. May 31, 
2024) (SDO). There, after rejecting an initial challenge to 
liability, the Director deferred determination on the issue of TTD benefits and the employer failed to challenge entitlement to 
(continued . . .) 
weekly benefit at the rate of sixty- six and two- thirds per 
cent of the employee’ s average weekly wages, subject to the 
[certain] limitations[.] 
Those limitations provided for in HRS § 386-31(b) do not apply to this case. 
29   
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
TTD benefits. Id., at *12. Unlike the present case, the LIRAB 
found a penalty was applicable. Id., at *13. The Seghorn LIRAB 
reasoned: 
According to the Hawaiʻ i  Supreme Court, the legislative 
purpose behind Section 386
-92, HRS is to assess a penalty “ in 
cases where an employer ... is notified of a work injury, 
does not deny liability for said injury under the law, and 
still neglects to pay TTD with ten days of notification.” 
Panoke[, 136 Hawaiʻ i]  at 467[, 363 P.3d at  315] (citation and 
quotation omitted). The Panoke  Court noted that “the 
committee reports also suggest that the legislature did not 
intend for employers contesting a determination of liability 
by the Director to be required to pay ongoing TTD benefits 
while the appeal is pending[][.]” [Id.] at 46[7- 68, 363 P.3d 
at 315-1 6].  The Court quoted from the legislative committee 
reports that the penalty is intended to apply to cases where 
“liability is not  denied and there is no question that 
compensation is due the injured worker.” [Id.] at 468[, 363 
P.3d at 316].  
Employer disputed liability for the November 23, 2015 
work injury in its initial report of industrial injury. The Director’ s November 2, 2016 decision determined Claimant’ s 
major depressive disorder as compensable. The Director did not award Claimant TTD benefits. Instead, the Director 
deferred determination on the issue of TTD. Employer could still challenge or dispute liability for and Claimant’ s 
entitlement to TTD, but did not do so. Employer paid Claimant TTD benefits in January and March 2017, which was 
well past 31 days after the Director's November 2, 2016 
decision[.]  
There was no decision ordering Employer to pay TTD 
until the decision on appeal, dated October 18, 2017, but Section 386- 31(b) states that TTD benefits should be paid, 
“.  .  . without waiting for a decision from the Director, 
unless the right is controverted.  .  .  .”  
On this record, a penalty pursuant to Section 386
-92, 
HRS is appropriate[.] 
Id. at *12-13 (emphasis in original). 
The LIRAB’s holding and reasoning in Seghorn is 
consistent with our holding and reasoning here. We therefore 
hold that the ICA erred in affirming the LIRAB’s reversal of 
30   
 
 
   
  
 
 
  
 
 
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Director’s imposition of a penalty for late payment of TTD 
benefits to Costa pursuant to HRS § 386-92. 
V. CONCLUSION 
For the reasons stated above, we vacate the ICA’s March  
20, 2024 Judgment on Appeal and the LIRAB’s January 31, 2018 Decision and Order reversing the Director’s April 25, 2014 
Decision assessing a 20% penalty against the County of Hawaiʻ i   for  
failure to timely pay TTD benefits due Costa under HRS § 386-92.   
We remand the case to the LIRAB for further proceedings 
consistent with this opinion.   The LIRAB shall assess a penalty  
in the amount of $4,277.84  
against the County of Hawai  ʻi pursuant  
to HRS § 386-92.   The LIRAB shall also determine attorneys’ fees   
and costs as provided for under HRS § 386-93(b) (Supp. 2012).    12

12 It has been more than a decade since the Director imposed the 
penalty on the County. At oral argument, Costa expressed an openness to 
seeking interest under either HRS §§ 478-3 (2008) or 636-16 (1993) on remand. 
Because this issue was not raised before this court, we express no opinion as 
to the propriety of interest in this context.
