OPINION OF THE COURT BY POLLACK, J.
 
 
  This case,  brought as a petition for writ of mandamus,  
asks us to review whether the Intermediate Court of Appeals 
(ICA) manifestly abused its discretion in setting the amount of 
a supersedeas bond as a condition of staying the enforcement of 
a judgment and writ of possession pending appeal.  Upon review Electronically Filed

 of relevant court rules and precedent, we conclude that 
petitioners have demonstrated a manifest abuse of discretion by 
the ICA as it did not apply relevant factors in setting the bond 
amount.  Accordingly
, we grant the petition and direct the ICA 
to re-determine the supersedeas bond amount in a manner 
consistent with this opinion.
  
I. BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
A. Background 
  This case arises  from a dispute over real property 
located in Hana on the island of Maui (the property)  where 
petitioners Graciano Kehopu Fernandez, Nancy Fernandez, Grace L. 
W. Fernandez-Chisholm, Damien K. Kaina Jr., Frank I. Kaina, 
Joseph T. Kaina, Patrick Kaina, and Tamara Smith- Kaukini 
(collectively, “Petitioners”) reside with their families.  
Petitioners maintain that they inherited the property from their 
uncle.  Respondent Annette M. Kelepolo, who is related to 
Petitioners through the first marriage of their grandmother, 
claims title to the property based on a quitclaim deed that was 
executed by power of attorney for Petitioners’ uncle on the day 
that he died in 2007.  The deed was recorded in the Bureau of 
Conveyances of the State of Hawai i on February 16, 2007.   
 
On August 18, 2016, Kelepolo filed a complaint for 
ejectment against 
Petitioners in the Circuit Court of the Second ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
3 Circuit (circuit court).1  Kelepolo alleged that she charged
Petitioners $120.00 in monthly rent to be paid on the 15th of 
each month--$100.00 would go towards real property taxes and 
$20.00 would go towards the water bill.  Kelepolo contended that 
Petitioners failed to pay rent for one year and had thereby 
breached their oral contract.2
Petitioners filed a n answer to Kelepolo’s complaint 
along with a counterclaim.  Petitioners’ counterclaim contested 
1According to the complaint, Kelepolo  initially filed a complaint 
for summary possession against Petitioners in the district court but 
voluntarily dismissed that complaint to pursue ejectment upon Petitioners’ 
assertion that they owned the property.  We have described an ejectment 
action in the following manner:  
Ejectment is a common law action once used to recover 
possession of land and for damages for the unlawful 
detention of its possession.  The lessor or real party in 
interest had to establish title in order to warrant 
recovery.  The comm on law action for ejectment has been 
modified by statute in many states and may come under the 
title of action for summary process, action for eviction, 
or forcible entry and detainer actions.  
Queen Emma Found. v. Tingco, 74 Haw. 294, 300 n.5, 845 P.2d 1186, 1189 n.5 
(1992) (citing Black’s Law Dictionary  516 (6th ed. 1990)); see also  Un Wong 
v. Kan Chu, 5 Haw. 225, 226 (Haw. Kingdom 1884); Hale v. Maikai, 12 Haw. 178,
182 (Haw. Terr. 1899).
Pursuant to the Hawai i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 604 -5 (Supp. 
2015), “The district courts shall not have cognizance of real actions, nor 
actions in which the title to real estate comes in question . . . .”  HRS 
§604-5(d); see also  HRS § 604
-6 (1993) (“Nothing in  section 604 -5 shall
preclude a district court from taking jurisdiction in ejectment proceedings
where the title to real estate does not come in question at the trial of the
action.”).
2Kelepolo’s complaint sought the following relief: entry of 
judgment giving Kelepolo possession of the property; a writ of possession 
directing law enforcement remove the tenants and their property; damages in 
an amount to be proven at trial based on trespass and unjust enrichment; a 
determination that title to the property is in Kelepolo; a determination that 
Kelepolo owned the property by adverse possession; and other relief deemed 
just and proper. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 Kelepolo’s claim to the property, alleging that the quitclaim 
deed was procured by fraud and must be rescinded and cancelled.  
Petitioners contended that,  when they agreed to pay for the real 
property taxes and water bill at a May 2015 meeting, Kelepolo 
appeared to acknowledge Petitioners’ rights to the property.  
Petitioners maintained that after making several contributions 
to the “fund,” they learned that Kelepolo was overstating the 
real property tax amount and collecting the funds into her own 
bank account instead of an account that was to be set up to 
collect the contributions for the property.   
  Kelepolo thereafter filed a motion for summary 
judgment as to all claims
, arguing that Petitioners’ claims to 
the property were based on, inter alia, “ mere speculation.”  
Following a hearing on the motion,3 the circuit court granted 
summary judgment in favor of Kelepolo, concluding  that 
Petitioners failed to establish a cognizable claim to the 
subject property through adverse possession and did not present 
any admissible evidence to support their assertion that the 
quitclaim deed was procured by fraud.  The court’s summary 
judgment order determined title to the property to be in 
Kelepolo and, alternatively, that Kelepolo was entitled to 
ownership through adverse possession;  the court granted Kelepolo

 a judgment of possession and a writ of possession.4  Kelepolo  
waived any right to seek money damages and none were  awarded.  
Judgment was entered in favor of Kelepolo, and Petitioners 
appealed to the ICA.   
B. Petitioners ’ Motions for Stay Pending Appeal 
 While the appeal was pending, Petitioners moved in the 
circuit court for a stay of proceedings to enforce the judgment 
pursuant to Hawai i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 62 and 
Hawaii Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 8.  Petitioners 
contended that Kelepolo was taking steps to enforce the judgment 
and eject them from the property.
  Kelepolo opposed Petitioners’  
motion for a stay and argued that the motion should be denied on 
the merits and, alternatively, that a ny proposed stay should  
require a supersedeas bond in the amount of $578,000, which 
consisted of the purported assessed value of the property 
($558,000) and Kelepolo’s estimated costs of maintenance, water, 
electricity, and property taxes ($20,000).   
 The motion was heard on May 24, 2018.   The circuit 
court ruled that the balance of irreparable harm and the public 
interest supported Petitioners’  request for a stay,  and the 
court required Petitioners to post a supersedeas  bond in the 
amount of $578,000.  The bond amount was r equired to be posted 
within 30 days of the court’s order.  
 
 The Court does find that balancing public interests 
and irreparable harm, the Court is going to grant 
                     
 4 The court’s summary judgment order dismissed all remaining claims 
and counterclaims with prejudice.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
6 
 Defendants’ motion to stay.  The Court will also, however, 
order that Defendants post a supersedeas bond.   
 Though Defendants assert that Plaintiff is not 
entitled to a supersedeas bond as this case does not 
involve a monetary judgment, the determination of the 
amount of the supersedeas bond, however, is committed to 
the sound discretion of the Court.  And the inherent 
discretion of the Court also allows for flexibility in 
determining the nature and extent of the bond.  
 The Court finds that the lack of a monetary judgment 
is due to Plaintiff’s flexibility in waiving her claim of 
monetary damages for unpaid rent and water consumption for 
many years.  Despite this waiver, the Court finds that 
Plaintiff still has the rights to the property that warrant 
the Court’s protection.  
 Therefore, in its discretion, the Court will order 
Defendants to post a supersedeas bond in the amount of 
$578,000.  This amount is based on the assessed value of 
the property and the estimated costs of maintenance, water, 
electricity, and taxes for two years . 
 Accordingly, the Court’s going to grant  
Defendants’ motion, will order Defendants post the 
supersedeas bond in that amount.  Within 30 days of filing 
the order, that’s the due date for the bond to be posted.  
(Emphasis added.)   
  Petitioners subsequently filed a motion for a stay in 
the ICA, arguing that the circuit court abused its discretion in 
imposing a supersedeas bond,  as a stay should have been granted 
without bond because no monetary damages were awarded, and that 
the amount was exorbitant and not related to the potential loss 
that Kelepolo could claim as a result of the stay .5  The ICA 
granted a stay on the condition that it would be effective upon 
the ICA’s approval of a supersedeas bond in the amount of  
$250,000 (stay order).  The ICA stated that the amount was based 
                     
 5 Petitioners subsequently filed a motion to stay enforcement of 
the judgment for possession and writ of possession pending review of the 
motion for stay filed in the ICA.  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 on the property’s tax assessed value and “other factors and 
circumstances in the case”6: 
Upon consideration of  . . . the papers in support and 
in opposition, and the record, including evidence of the 
subject property ’s tax-assessed value and other factors and 
circumstances in the case, it appears that a supersedeas 
bond in the amount of $250,000 would adequately secure 
. . . Kelepolo ’s interest pending appeal.  
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motions for 
stay are granted in part.  A stay of further enforcement of 
the Second Circuit Court ’s Judgment for Possession and Writ 
of Possession is granted on the condition that Appellants 
submit to this court for its approval a supersedeas bond in 
the amount of Two -Hundred- Fifty Thousand and no/100 Dollars 
($250,000).  The stay will take effect upon the approval of 
the supersedeas bond by this court.  
(Bold font omitted and emphasis added.)  The ICA’s stay order 
did not provide a date by which the supersedeas bond was 
required to be posted and did not limit Kelepolo’s ability to 
execute the judgment prior to Petitioners posting the bond.  
Petitioners filed a motion for
 reconsideration or modification 
of the ICA’s stay order, requesting, inter alia, a reduction in 
the bond amount and a reasonable time to post the bond
; the ICA 
denied the motion.7   
C. Petitioners ’ Application for Writ of Certiorari or, in the 
Alternative, Petition for Writ of Mandamus   
 
  Petitioners subsequently filed an “A pplication for 
Writ of Certiorari or in the Alternative Petition for Writ of 
                     
 6 The ICA did not explain what the “other factors and 
circumstances” were that it considered.  
 7 Petitioners filed a third motion for a stay in the ICA, seeking 
to stay enforcement pending review of their request for reconsideration.   The 
ICA denied this motion as moot.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
8 
 Mandamus” (Petition) from the ICA’s stay order and the 
subsequent order denying the motion for reconsideration
.  
Relevant to the mandamus relief requested, Petitioners argue 
that the ICA manifestly abused its discretion in setting the 
$250,000 bond amount because it did not bear any rational 
relation to any damages that Kelepolo may incur as a result of a 
delay in enforcing the judgment while the appeal is pending.  
Petitioners suggest that the amoun t of the supersedeas bond 
should not exceed $8,000 (the monthly rent amount ($120) for 
each of the five Petitioners who reside at the property for 12 
months), which they contend is an amount correlating to the 
anticipated duration of the appeal. 
  They also argue  that the ICA abused its discretion 
because it did not allow Petitioners a reasonable amount of time 
to post the supersedeas bond.  Petitioners assert that 
“[s]etting the amount of the bond without a temporary stay to 
secure the bond defeated the purpose of the bond.”  Finally, 
Petitioners contend that mandamus relief is appropriate because 
the ICA has already denied their motion for reconsideration, 
they have been unable to post a bond in the amount required by 
the ICA, and they are faced with immediate eviction if a stay is 
not granted.  
Accordingly, Petitioners ask that this court grant 
their Petition and direct  the ICA to modify its stay order to ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
9 
 conform the amount of the supersedeas bond, if any, to our 
decision in Midkiff v. de Bisschop, 58 Haw. 546, 574 P.2d 128 
(1978), and related caselaw and to set forth a reasonable time 
period to post the bond.  Petitioners argue the supersedeas bond 
amount should be based on the likelihood of prevailing on 
appeal, the balancing of irreparable harms, the public interest, 
and the potential damages, if any, that Kelepolo may incur as a 
result of a delay during the appeal based on the evidence in the 
record. 
  As to the request for certiorari review, this court 
dismissed the application for writ of certiorari pursuant to 
Hawaii Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 40.1(a) (2017) 
and Hawai i Revised Statutes (HRS)  §§ 602-5(a)(1) (2016) and 602-
59(a) (2016).  However, Kelepolo was directed to file an answer 
to Petitioners’ request for mandamus relief.  
We granted a 
temporary stay of enforcement of the circuit court’s judgment 
for possession and writ of possession pending review of the 
petition seeking mandamus relief.   
In her answer to the Petition, Kelepolo argues that 
Petitioners fail to demonstrate a clear and indisputable right 
to relief and a lack of alternative means of redress.  Kelepolo  
maintains that although the stay order does not include a time 
period within which the bond must be posted, Petitioners had ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
10 
 more than a reasonable time to post the bond or alternative 
security but failed to do so.
  Because the ICA’s order provides 
that “[t]he stay will take effect upon the approval of the 
supersedeas bond,” Kelepolo contends that the ICA did not err by 
refusing to include a “reasonable time” to post a bond in the 
stay order.  Additionally, the ICA did not abuse its discretion, 
Kelepolo argues,  as the appellate rules do not contain any 
language that restricts what considerations may be taken into 
account by a court determining in its discretion the appropriate 
amount of a supersedeas bond.  Finally, Kelepolo maintains that 
Petitioners failed to meet their burden to request or provide 
alternative security in lieu of posting a superse deas bond.   
  In reply, Petitioners reiterate their arguments  that 
the ICA failed to address their contention that the stay should 
have been granted without a bond,  the ICA abused its discretion 
in setting a bond amount that appeared arbitrary, and the ICA’s 
stay order failed to afford them any time to try to secure a 
bond.  They note that, in light of this court’s stay of the 
judgment pending disposition of this proceeding, the issue of 
the ICA’s failure to set forth a reasonable time period to 
comply or otherwise respond to the ICA’s stay order is moot,  but 
Petitioners continue to raise the issue so that it is not 
repeated in the future.

 II. STANDARD S OF REVIEW 
A. Writ of mandamus 
  A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that 
will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and 
indisputable right to the relief requested and a lack of other 
means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or to obtain th
e 
requested action.  Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai ʻi 200, 204, 982 P.2d 
334, 338 (1999).   
B. Amount of Bond or Security  
  T he amount of a bond or alternative security 
sufficient to protect the rights of an appellee is committed to 
the court’s sound discretion.  See Shanghai Inv. Co.  v. Alteka 
Co., 92 Hawai i 482, 503-04, 993 P.2d 516, 537-38 (2000)
, 
overruled on other grounds by Blair v. Ing, 96 Hawaii 327, 331 
n.6, 335-36, 31 P.3d 184, 188 n.6, 192-93 (2001). 
III.  DISCUSSION 
A. Stay of Enforcement of Judgment b y the Circuit Court and 
Appellate Court Pending  Appeal 
  It is well recognized that “[t]he purpose of posting a 
supersedeas bond is to preserve the status quo” and protect the 
appellee’s rights during the appeal.  Shanghai Inv. Co. , 92 
Hawaii at 503-04, 993 P.2d at  537-38 (quoting Poplar Grove 
Planting & Refining Co. v.  Bache Halsey Stuart, Inc., 600 F.2d 
1189, 1190-91 (5th Cir. 1979)).  Hence, a supersedeas bond ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
12 
 serves as security to protect the appellee from the risk of loss 
occasioned by the stay of execution should the appellee prevail 
on appeal.  Rachel v. Banana Republic, Inc., 831 F.2d 1503, 1505 
n.1 (9th Cir. 1987); NLRB v. Westphal, 859 F.2d 818, 819 (9th 
Cir. 1988) (per curiam).  A court, accordingly, should generally 
attempt to protect nonappealing parties from any loss that may 
be incurred as a result of the stay of a judgment when setting a 
supersedeas bond.  5 Am.  Jur. 2d Appellate Review § 374 (May 
2020 Update) (“[T]he amount of a supersedeas bond should be 
sufficient to protect the appellee in [their]  judgment[.]” 
(footnotes omitted)); see  Poplar Grove, 600 F.2d at 1190 -91 
(supersedeas bond in the amount of $10,000 for a $270,985.65 
judgment was insufficient). 
  In our circuit court s, a stay of proceedings to 
enforce a judgment is  governed by HRCP Rule 62 (1980).  HRCP 
Rule 62(d) provides as follows:  
When an appeal is taken the appellant by giving a 
supersedeas bond may obtain a stay subject to the 
exceptions contained in subdivision (a) of this rule.[8]  The 
bond may be given at or after the time of filing the notice 
of appeal or of procuring the order allowing the appeal, as 
                     
 8 HRCP Rule 62(a) provides in relevant part as follows:  
 
Unless otherwise ordered by the court, an interlocutory or 
final judgment in an action for an injunction or in a 
receivership action, or a judgment or order directing an 
accounting shall not be stayed during the period after its 
entry and until an appeal is taken or during the pendency 
of an appeal.  The provisions of subdivision[] (c) of this 
rule govern the suspending, modifying, restoring, or 
granting of an injunction during the pendency of an appeal.  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
13 
 the case may be.  The stay is effective when the 
supersedeas bond is approved by the court.  
 
Thus, subject to the specified exceptions, a n appellant may 
obtain a stay of the execution of a judgment at or after the 
time the notice of appeal is filed
, or when an order is obtained 
allowing the appeal, by posting a supersedeas bond.   HRCP Rule 
62(d).  The stay is effective when the bond is approv ed by the 
court.  Id.    
  Under our caselaw , a trial court has inherent 
authority to determine the nature and extent of the security to 
be furnished in the exercise of a party’s right to obtain a stay 
pending an appeal.  Shanghai Inv. Co. , 92 Hawai i at 503-04, 993 
P.2d at 537- 38.  In Shanghai Inv estment Co., we discussed the  
trial court’s “inherent discretion” to determine appropriate 
security in light of HRCP Rule 62(d)
:    
Other jurisdictions have indicated that “the rule and the 
inherent discretion and power of the trial court allow for 
flexibility in the determination of the nature and extent 
of the security required to stay the execution of the 
judgment pending appeal.”  Bruce Church, Inc. v. Superior 
Court, 160 Ariz. 514, 774 P.2d 818, 821 (App.1989)  . . . .  
The burden to provide a secure alternative rests on the 
judgment debtor.   Poplar Grove, 600 F.2d at 1191. 
Id. (other citations omitted).  W e adopted Poplar Grove’s 
reasoning that the sound financial circumstances of a judgment 
debtor may be considered by the 
trial court in determining 
suitable security.  Id.  This permits the court to exercise its 
discretion to substitute some form of guaranty of judgment in ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
14 (continued . . .)  
 lieu of a supersedeas bond.  On the other hand, if a full bond 
would unduly burden the debtor, the court may  allow arrangement 
of substitute security that would equally protect the judgment 
creditor.  
[I]f a judgment debtor objectively demonstrates a present 
financial ability to facilely respond to a money judgment 
and presents to the court a financially secure plan for 
maintaining that same degree of solvency during the period 
of an appeal, the court may then exercise a discretion to 
substitute some form of guaranty of judgment  responsibility 
for the usual supersedeas bond.  Contrariwise, if the 
judgment debtor’ s present financial condition is such that 
the posting of a full bond would impose an undue financial 
burden, the court similarly is free to exercise [its]  
discretion to fashion some other arrangement for substitute 
security through an appropriate restraint on the judgment 
debtor’s financial dealings, which would furnish equal 
protection to the judgment creditor.  
 
Shanghai Inv. Co., 92 Hawai i at 503-04, 993 P.2d at 537-38 
(quoting Poplar Grove, 600 F.2d at 1191) (“We believe the 
approach taken by the  Bruce Church  and Poplar Grove  courts to be 
the appropriate one. ”).  Thus, while HRCP Rule 62(d) does not 
expressly authorize a trial court  to allow a party to provide 
alternative security in lieu of a supersedeas bond, our 
precedent clearly recognizes a court’s  inherent discretion to 
approve such a request.9  Id. 
  HRCP Rule 62(d)’s counterpart, former Federal Rules of 
Civil Procedure (FRCP) Rule 62(d) (reorganized 2018) ,10 has been 
                     
 9 It is noted that the circuit court is required to grant a stay 
without bond when the State or county is the appellant requesting a stay of 
enforcement of the judgment.  HRCP Rule 62(e).  
 
 10 Former FRCP Rule 62(d) provided as follows:  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
15 
 similarly interpreted by several federal courts as allowing 
judges to have discretion to determine the appropriate security 
to effectuate a stay.  
See, e.g. , Olympia Equip. Leasing Co. v. 
W. Union Tel. Co. , 786 F.2d at 794, 797 (7th Cir. 1986) 
(concluding that “[FRCP] Rule 62(d) does not impose an ironclad 
requirement of a supersedeas  bond”); Miami Int ’l Realty Co. v. 
Paynter, 807 F.2d 871, 873- 74 (10th Cir. 1986) (holding that the 
court did not err in granting a stay without a supersedeas bond 
in the full amount of the judgment); Fed . Prescription Serv., 
Inc. v. Am. Pharm . Ass’n, 636 F.2d 755, 759- 61 (D.C. Cir. 1980) 
(FRCP Rule 62(d) “in no way necessarily implies that filing a 
bond is the only way to obtain a stay”); Po plar Grove , 600 F.2d 
at 1191.  In deed, in 2018, FRCP Rule 62 was amended to 
specifically provide authority to the court to accept 
alternative security in lieu of a bond.  FRCP Rule 62 advisory 
committee’s note to 2018 amendments ; see FRCP Rule 62(b) (Stay 
                                                                              
(. . . continued) 
 
When an appeal is taken the appellant by giving a 
supersedeas bond may obtain a stay subject to the 
exceptions contained in subdivision (a) of this rule.  The 
bond may be given at or after the time of filing the notice 
of appeal or  of procuring the order allowing the appeal, as 
the case may be.  The stay is effective when the 
supersedeas bond is approved by the court.   
Becker v. United States, 451 U.S. 1306, 1307 (1981) (quoting former FRCP Rule 
62(d)).  These provisions were amended and reorganized into current FRCP Rule 
62(b) in 2018.  See FRCP Rule 62 advisory committee’s notes to 2018 
amendments.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
16 (continued . . .)  
 by Bond or Other Security).11  This amendment, in effect, 
formalized procedures that many federal courts  had already 
followed.  See 16A Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice 
and Procedure § 3954.1, at 696  (Supp. 2019) (recognizing that 
appellate courts asked to issue a stay pursuant to FRCP Rule 
62(b) have applied caselaw developed under prior FRCP Rule 
62(d)).  Thus, Hawai i courts, like federal courts , have 
authority to determine the appropriate bond or other security to 
effectuate a stay.  
  
In the Hawai ʻi appellate courts, a motion for stay of 
judgment is governed by HRAP Rule 8 (2010).12  This rule provides 
                     
 11 Current FRCP Rule 62(b) (2018) provides as follows:  
Stay by Bond or Other Security.  At any time after judgment 
is entered, a party may obtain a stay by providing a bond 
or other security.  The stay takes effect when the court 
approves the bond or other security and remains in effect 
for the time specified in the bond or other security.  
 
The Permanent Committee on Rules of Civil Procedure and Circuit Court Civil 
Rules may wish to consider the appropriateness of an amendment to HRCP Rule 
62. 
 
 12 HRAP Rule 8(a) provides in part as follows:  
A motion for stay of the judgment or order in a civil 
appeal, or for approval of a supersedeas bond, or for an 
order suspending, modifying, restoring, or granting an 
injunction during the pendency of an appeal shall 
ordinarily be made in the first instance to the court or 
agency appealed from.  
 A motion for such relief on an appeal may be made to 
the appellate court before which the appeal is pending or 
to a judge thereof, but, if the appeal is from a court, the 
motion shall show that application to the court appealed 
from for the relief sought is not practicable, or that the 
court appealed from has denied an application, or has 
failed to afford the relief the applicant requested, with ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

appellate court in which the appeal is pending when application 
to the court appealed from is not practicable, the relief sought 
has been denied, or the relief requested has not been afforded.13

  U pon proper motion, an appellate court has discretion

security in the court or agency appealed from.”14  The

copies thereof. . . .  
 
 13 The circuit court rules do not in any way restrict the appellate 
courts from staying the proceedings during the pendency of an appeal.  HRCP 
Rule 62(g) provides as follows:   
 
The provisions in this rule do not limit any power of the 
supreme court or of the intermediate court of appeals or of 
a justice or judge thereof to stay proceedings during the 
pendency of an appeal or to suspend, modify, restore, or 
grant an injunction during the pendency of an appeal or to 
make any order appropriate to preserve the status quo or 
the effectiveness of the judgment subsequently to be 
entered. 
 
 14 HRAP Rule 8 provides the  appellate court with authority to not 
require the posting of a bond or security to obtain a stay, as it states that 
relief in the appellate courts “may be conditioned  upon the filing of a bond 
or other appropriate security in the court or agency appealed from.” ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

Practice and Procedure  § 2908, at 730  (2012).  
  While HRCP Rule 62(d) and (g) and HRAP Rule 8 are 
silent as to the factors to be considered in determining the 
appropriate amount of a supersedeas bond, our decision in 
Midkiff v. de Bisschop
, 58 Haw. 546, 574 P.2d 128 (1978), is 
instructive, particularly in the absence of a money judgment.  
In Midkiff, this court addressed the amount of a supersedeas 
bond to stay enforcement of a writ of possession under prior  
HRCP Rule 73(d) (repealed 1984).15  58 Haw.  at 549-50, 574 P.2d 
at 131.  We stated that,  when an appeal is from  a judgment 
                                                                              
(. . . continued) 
 
(Emphasis added.)  Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 8(a)(2)(E) 
(2018), which similarly provides that the “court may condition relief on a 
party’s filing a bond or other security in the district court,” has been held 
to authorize the federal  appellate courts to “stay a judgment pending appeal, 
with or without bond.”  Lightfoot v. Walker, 797 F.2d 505, 507 (7th Cir. 
1986).  We do not address the circuit court’s authority in this regard.  See 
generally 11 Wright, Miller, and Kane, supra, § 2905, at 720. 
 
 15 Former HRCP Rule 73(d) at that time provided as follows:  
“When the judgment determines the disposition of the 
property in controversy as in real actions, replevin, and 
actions to foreclose mortgages or when such property is in 
the custody of a duly authorized officer or when the 
proceeds of such property or a bond for its value is in the 
custody or control of the court, the amount of the 
supersedeas bond shall be fixed at such sum only as will 
secure the amount recovered for the use and detention of 
the property, the costs of the action, costs on appeal, 
interest, and damages for delay.”   
 
Midkiff, 58 Haw. at 549 -50, 574 P.2d at 131 (quoting former HRCP Rule 73(d)).  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
19 
 awarding possession of land,  this rule limits the bond amount to 
the amount recoverable by the successful appellee for the 
temporary deprivation of the use of the property .   
Significantly, Rule 73(d) limits the amount of the bond to 
the amount recoverable by Appellees in the event they are 
successful in the appeal.  The supersedeas bond stands as 
security for the payment of this amount and cannot 
otherwise be the foundation of a claim by appellees.  When 
the appeal is from a judgment awarding possession of land, 
the cause of action of  the successful appellee is to 
recover for temporarily being deprived of the use of the 
premises.  Jenkins v. Morgan, 123 Utah 480, 260 P.2d 532 
(1953); Annot., Measure and Amount of Damages Recoverable 
Under Supersedeas Bond in Action Involving Recovery or 
Possession of Real Estate, 9 A.L.R.3d 330 (1966).   
Id. at 550, 574 P.2d at 131.  When setting a supersedeas bond 
amount, Midkiff further explains , the court must determine what 
damages for delay the appellee might reasonably be expected to 
incur, which must be shown with adequate certainty in the event 
the appeal is resolved in the appellee’s favor.   
The assessment of such damages in an action upon a 
supersedeas bond is necessarily subject to the general 
rules that the extent of the appellee’s loss must  be shown 
with reasonable certainty  and conclusions may not be 
founded on speculation.  Uyemura v. Wick, 57 Haw. 102, 551 
P.2d 171 (1976).   
 
Id.  Additionally, the Mid kiff court emphasized  that in the 
context of a judgment awarding possession of land, the bond 
amount must not be used to discourage appeals.   And, a bond 
amount that unduly burdens the appellant and is unrelated to the 
damages recoverable by the appellee 
if the appellee is 
successful on appeal may be  constitutionally defective.  
The determination of the amount of a supersedeas bond which 
will be sufficient to protect the rights of an appellee is 
committed to the sound discretion of the circuit court, but ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
20 
 this discretion is not unlimited.  Moreover, the bond 
requirement may not be used to discourage appeals.  A 
requirement, in a tenant’s appeal, of a supersedeas bond in 
an amount unrelated to actual rent accrued and specific 
damage sustained by the landlord has been held to be 
constitutionally defective where the result was to burden 
appealing tenants more greatly than other appellants.  
Lindsey v. Normet, 405 U.S. 56, 92 S.Ct. 862, 31 L.Ed.2d 36 
(1972). 
 
Id. (emphasis added).  Thus, while determination of the bond 
amount sufficient to protect the rights of the appellee is 
within the court’s discretion, such discretion is constrained by 
relevant considerations.  Id.   
  We note that since Midkiff was decided, HRCP Rule 
73(d) and its federal counterpart, Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure (FRCP) Rule 73(d) (repealed 1968), have been rescinded  
in light of the adoption of the Hawaii Rules of Appellate 
Procedure and the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure (FRAP), 
respectively.16  But even following its repeal, FRCP Rule 73(d) 
has provided guidance to federal courts in the setting of the 
amount of a supersedeas bond under FRCP Rule 62(d).  See, e.g., 
Poplar Grove, 600 F.2d at 1191 (“Although the present [FRCP Rule 
62(d)] does not by its terms precisely define the amount and 
conditions of a supersedeas bond, it has been read consistently 
with the earlier [FRCP Rule 73(d)] .”); Tully v. Kerguen, 304 F.

Miller & Kane , supra, § 2905, at 715  (“[F]ormer Rule 73(d) 
described what a lways has been good practice on a supersedeas 
bond, and . . . it is still a useful guide on these matters. ” 
(footnote omitted)) ; see also Asarco LLC v. Americas Mining 
Corp., 419 B.R. 737, 741 -42 (Bankr. S.D. Tex. 2009) (citing 
Poplar Grove for its holding  that prior FRCP Rule 73(d) provides 
the general rule that applies to FRCP Rule 62(d)) .   
  As with repealed FRCP Rule 73, former HRCP Rule 73 and 
cases interpreting it have continued vitality and serve as 
guidance to our courts when setting a supersedeas bond amount.  
Specifically, Midkiff’s reasoning and the factors set forth in 
former HRCP Rule 73(d) remain consonant with the purpose of 
posting a supersedeas bond during appeals and determining its 
amount in cases involving judgments that resolve  the disposition 
of property.  In this regard, former HRCP Rule 73(d) expressly 
provided several factors that continue to be appropriate for the 
court’s consideration when setting a bond amount: 
“When the judgment determines the disposition of the 
property in controversy as in real actions, replevin, and 
actions to foreclos e mortgages . . . the amount of the 
supersedeas bond shall be fixed at such sum only as will 
secure the amount recovered for the use and detention of ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
22 (continued . . .)  
 the property, the costs of the action, costs on appeal, 
interest, and damages for delay. ”   
 
Midkiff, 58 Haw. at 549-50, 574 P.2d at 131 (quoting former HRCP 
Rule 73(d)).  As the purpose of setting a supersedeas bond is to 
maintain the status quo and secure the appellee’s interest 
during the appeal, when the judgment determines the disposition 
of property--as in real actions or actions to foreclose 
mortgages--a court should consider the amount recoverable for 
the use and detention of the property, the costs of the action, 
costs on appeal, interest, and damages for delay when setting a 
supersedeas bond amount. 
 Id.  In considering such factors, a 
trial court properly exercises its discretion to determine a sum 
that is limited to the amount that will appropriately protect  
the appellee during the appeal.   
Further, as Midkiff recognizes, a trial court’s 
discretion in setting a bond amount is not unlimited and the 
bond requirement may not be used to discourage appeals.  Id.  at 
550, 574 P.2d at 131.  A court may thus be required to consider 
additional factors bearing on the appropriateness of the bond 
amount under the circumstances of a given case.  Such factors 
include, for example, any appealing party’s financial ability to 
post the bond, the hardship to the parties,17 and the public 
                     
 17 A supersedeas bond serves a “dual protection role” for both the  
appellant and the appellee.  Poplar Grove, 600 F.2d at 1191.  Thus, in ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 interest.18  See Azizian v. Federated Dep’t Stores, Inc., 499 
F.3d 950, 961 (9th Cir. 2007) (noting that requiring security 
for attorney’s fees under FRAP Rule 7 may be improper when 
factors such as financial hardship indicate that a monetary bond 
would unduly burden the party’s right to appeal); Olympia Equip. 
Leasing Co., 786 F.2d at 798-99  (considering effect on 
defendant’s other creditors if plaintiff were allowed to execute 
judgment instead of accepting defendant’s alternative security 
in lieu of full bond); Miami Int ’l, 807 F.2d at 874 (concluding 
that the district court did not err in granting a stay without a 
full supersedeas bond when appellant did not have sufficient 
assets to post full bond  and execution on the judgment would 
place appellant in insolvency) .   
  Finally, a court has discretion to consider a reduced 
bond or other forms of security aside from a full bond when 
determining whether and in what amount a supersedeas bond is 
necessary to maintain the status quo.  See HRAP Rule 8(b) 
(stating that a stay may be conditioned on other appropriate

to be considered  by the court.   
 18 We note that a court’s discretion may also be limited by statute 
or rule.  HRAP Rule 8(b) (“If security is given in the form of a bond or 
stipulation or other undertaking . . . the bond, stipulation, or undertaking 
shall comply with app
licable statutes[.]”); HRS §  607-26 (2016) (limit on 
supersedeas bond).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 security); see also Poplar Gove, 600 F.2d at 1191 (a court has 
discretion to approve substitute security that would equally 
protect the judgment creditor if posting a full bond would 
impose an undue financial burden on the judgment debtor); 11 
Wright, Miller & Kane, supra , § 2905, at 716 -17 (courts have 
inherent power to provide for a bond in a lesser amount or to 
permit security other than the bond).  The burden to provide a 
secure alternative to a bond rests with the appellant.  See  
Shanghai Inv. Co., 92 Hawai i at 503, 993 P.2d at 537.19   
B. The Supersedeas Bond Amount in This Case 
  In this case, the circuit court set the amount of the 
bond at $578,000 based on the tax assessed value of the property 
($558,500) and the estimated costs of water, electricity, and ad 
valorem taxes for two or more years ($20,000).  The circuit 
court also set forth a 30-day time frame in which Petitioners 
were required to post the bond.  The ICA reduced the bond amount 
to $250,000 based on “evidence of the subject property’s tax-
assessed value and other factors and circumstances in the case” 
and its conclusion that the bond “would adequately secure . . . 
Kelepolo’s interest pending appeal.”  The ICA did not elaborate 
                     
 19 The family and district courts should also consider the foregoing 
relevant factors, as appropriate, when ruling on a motion to stay the 
enforcement of a judgment pursuant to Hawai i Family Court Rules Rule 62 or 
District Court Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 62.    ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
25 
 as to the “other factors” it considered or provide any time 
period for Petitioners to post the reduced bond amount. 
  The $250,000 bond amount set by the ICA is not based 
on the amount that Kelepolo would reasonably be expected to 
recover f or being temporarily deprived of the use of the 
property during the pendency of the appeal and any recoverable 
appellate costs and damages related to the delay.   Midkiff,  58 
Haw. at 550, 574 P.2d at 131.  Instead, the reasons provided by 
the ICA to substantiate the bond amount are “evidence of the 
subject property’s tax
-assessed value” and “other factors and 
circumstances in the case.”  These reasons do not provide an 
adequate basis for determining an amount that would be 
appropriate to protect Kelepolo’s interest during the appeal.  
Without additional information or evidence as to what comprised 
the “other factors and circumstances in the case” that the ICA 
considered when setting the bond amount, the bond amount of 
$250,000 is arbitrary and cannot be sustained as an appropriate 
amount based on consideration of the recoverable amount, “shown 
with reasonable certainty, ” that Kelepolo could expect to obtain 
upon prevailing on appeal.  Midkiff , 58 Haw. at 550, 574 P.2d at 
131. 
  Specifically, there is no indication that the ICA 
based the amount of the bond on any costs or damages that 
Kelepolo would incur from being temporarily deprived of the use ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
26 
 of the premises during the pendency of the appeal.  Indeed, both 
the ICA and the circuit court appear to have substantially 
relied on the assessed value of the property in setting the 
amount of the bond, which does not appear to bear any relation 
to the amount that the appellee could expect to recover as a 
result of a delay in enforcing the judgment upon a successful 
appeal.  The ICA and the circuit court should have considered 
the property’s rental value, costs of the appeal, and damages 
for delay that Kelepolo may have  reasonably expected to sustain , 
if any, during the appeal that could be established with 
adequate certainty.  Midkiff , 58 Haw. at 550, 574 P.2d at 131-
32.  And while Kelepolo’s memorandum in opposition listed the 
estimated costs of “maintenance, water, electricity, [and] ad 
valorem taxes for two (or more) years” at $20,000, this number 
alone clearly does not justify the ICA’s bond amount of 
$250,000.  The record is also silent regarding whether Kelepolo 
intended to put the property on the market for sale and, if so, 
whether there was any buyer at an offered sale price, or whether 
Petitioners’ presence on the property was disrupting Kelepolo’s 
ability to enjoy her property in other ways, other than loss 
rent.  There is also no indication that the ICA considered the 
public interest, Petitioners’ ability to pay the bond amount, or 
whether the amount would pose a hardship on Petitioners when 
setting the amount. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
27 
   T he Petition also indicates that Petitioners have been 
unable to post a bond in the amount required by the ICA, and the 
arbitrary amount of the bond could discourage Petitioners from 
moving forward with the appeal if it impose s an undue burden 
upon them.  And the ICA’s stay  order, which did not prevent 
Kelepolo from immediately pursuing  execution of the judgment,  
could have also had the  effect of frustrating Petitioners’ 
appeal.  As we stated in Midkiff , the bond amount may not be 
used to discourage appeals,  and an amount that is unrelated to 
the damages recoverable by the appellee if successful on appeal 
and that burdens the appellant “ more greatly”  than other 
appellants may be constitutionally flawed.  58 Haw. at 550, 574 
P.2d at 131.  
  Additionally, the ICA’s failure to include a 
reasonable time period in  which Petitioners could post the bond 
and thereby effectuate the stay also hindered the purpose of the 
supersedeas bond.  As stated in the ICA’s stay order, “The stay 
will take effect upon the approval of the supersedeas bond by 
this court.”  The result  of the ICA’s order is that no stay 
would be in effect until the ICA accepted Petitioners’ bond.  
See Shanghai Inv. Co., 92 Hawai i at 503, 993 P.2d at 537 (“[T]he 
necessary implication is that without giving a supersedeas bond 
or unless otherwise ordered by the Court,  the order is not 
stayed, even though an appeal is pending.” (quoting MDG Supply, ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
28 
 Inc. v. Diversified Invs., Inc., 51 Haw. 375, 381, 463 P.2d 525 , 
529 (1969)).  Kelepolo was therefore free to enforce the 
judgment until such time as the court approved Petitioners’ 
bond.  The ICA’s omission in not providing  a reasonable time 
period in which Petitioners could post the bond could have 
undermined the pu rpose of the  supersedeas bond.  See  Hackin v. 
Superior Court , 425 P.2d 420, 421 (Ariz. 1967) (“Therefore, the 
lower court, upon notice of appeal, should determine as quickly 
as possible the amount of the supersedeas bond, stay execution 
for a reasonable time to permit the party appealing to post the 
bond, and thereby stay and preserve the status quo.  Otherwise 
the effect might be to render nugatory the purpose of the 
supersedeas bond.”).  The ICA therefore should have granted a 
temporary stay to allow Petitioners a reasonable time period in 
which to post a bond and effectuate the stay.   
  Accor dingly, the ICA’s stay order is flawed in two 
significant respects: (1) the amount of the supersedeas bond 
appears to be arbitrary in not reflecting a rational basis for 
an amount that would be in accordance with preserving the status 
quo and adequately protecting Kelepolo’s interest during the 
pendency of the appeal, and (2) the stay order lacked a 
reasonable timeframe in which Petitioners would be required to 
post the bond.  Accordingly, it is clear that the ICA manifestly ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
29 
 abused its discretion by  not applying relevant factors under our 
law in setting the supersedeas bond amount.  
IV. CONCLUSION 
  Based on the foregoing, the petition for writ of 
mandamus is granted.  The ICA is directed to re- determine the 
amount of the supersedeas bond of its August 15, 2018 stay order 
in No. CAAP-18-0000138 and order a bond amount, as appropriate, 
consistent with this opinion.
