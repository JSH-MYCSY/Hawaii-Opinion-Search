2 In 2017, the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit found 
Lewanna Godinez in default on her mortgage and granted summary 
judgment in favor of Respondent/Plaintiff PennyMac Corp., issuing a decree of foreclosure and entering final judgment.  
Before a foreclosure sale took place, Godinez filed an HRCP Rule 
60(b) motion, raising the issue of PennyMac’s standing to bring 
a foreclosure action against her.  The circuit court denied the 
motion, and Godinez appealed.  The Intermediate Court of Appeals 
(ICA) affirmed the circuit court’s denial, holding that res 
judicata barred Godinez’s HRCP Rule 60(b) challenge to standing, citing to this court’s decision in Mortgage Electronic 
Registration Systems v. Wise, 130 Hawaiʻ i 11, 17, 304 P.3d 1192, 
1198 (2013).   
We hold that res judicata did not preclude Godinez’s 
post-judgment HRCP Rule 60(b) motion and that Wise is 
inapplicable under these circumstances.  Nevertheless, we agree with the ICA that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion 
in denying Godinez’s HRCP Rule 60(b) motion.  Accordingly, we 
affirm the judgment of the ICA.   
II. BACKGROUND
A. Factual Background
In December 2007, Godinez executed and delivered to 
Washington Mutual Bank, FA, a mortgage encumbering real property ***  FOR  PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 on Maui as security for a promissory note.   In September 2008, 
the United States Department of the Treasury closed Washington 
Mutual Bank, FA, appointing the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as receiver.   1
  In January 2010, Godinez defaulted on the note.  The FDIC then assigned the Mortgage to J.P. Morgan Chase Bank in a 
Corporate Assignment of Mortgage.   B. Circuit Court Proceedings 
  On July 5, 2013, Chase
 initiated foreclosure 
proceedings in the circuit court.2  While foreclosure proceedings 
were pending, in February 2014, Chase assigned its mortgage 
interest to PennyMac through a Hawaiʻ i Assignment of Mortgage 
recorded on April 28, 2014.  In May 2015,3 Chase filed a motion 
to substitute PennyMac as the plaintiff and “real party in 
interest.”  The circuit court granted the motion and amended the 
complaint and caption.   
  In March 2016, PennyMac filed a motion for summary 
judgment asking the circuit court to find Godindez in default on the promissory note and mortgage, and issue a decree of 
                     
1  The mortgage was recorded in the State of Hawaiʻ i Bureau of 
Conveyances on December 12, 2007.   
   
 2  The Honorable Rh onda I.L. Loo presided. 
 
3  Between April 3, 2014 and February 25, 2015, the case was put on 
hold for loss mitigation.

 foreclosure.  In support, PennyMac submitted a declaration 
attesting, “[PennyMac] has possession of the promissory note 
with standing to prosecute the instant action and the right to foreclose the subject Mortgage.”  Godinez opposed the motion and 
argued, inter alia, that “PennyMac admittedly lacked standing at 
the time of the filing of the Complaint and therefore this Court 
lacks jurisdiction[.]”  The circuit court held a hearing on 
PennyMac’s motion for summary judgment on June 28, 2016.
  At the 
close of the hearing, the court orally granted the motion.     After the summary judgment hearing but before a 
written summary judgment order was filed, this court decided 
Bank of America, N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawaiʻ i 361, 390 P.3d 
1248 (2017), which held that “a foreclosing plaintiff must 
establish entitlement to enforce the note” by showing they had physical possession of it “at the time the action was 
commenced[.]”  Id. at 368, 390 P.3d at 1255.  Accordingly, on 
May 15, 2017,4 Godinez filed a motion to dismiss for lack of 
standing, arguing “[PennyMac] clearly states [it was the] holder 
in due course of the note at the time of the verified complaint, 
but do[es] not present evidence in any exhibits.”  During a 
hearing on the motion, Godinez argued the then-recent decisions 
                     
4  On July 20, 2016, Godinez filed for bankruptcy, and the 
foreclosure proceedings were stayed until April 2017 when the bankruptcy 
proceedings terminated.   ***  FOR  PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 in Reyes-Toledo, and U.S. Bank, N.A. v. Mattos, 140 Hawaiʻ i 26, 
398 P.3d 615 (2017), demonstrated that PennyMac lacked standing.  
 
  In response, PennyMac argued that Godinez’s standing 
arguments were barred under the law of the case doctrine because 
the circuit court had already resolved the issue and orally granted PennyMac’s motion for summary judgment.  Nevertheless, 
recognizing that Reyes-Toledo required foreclosing parties to 
show they had possession of the note at the time the foreclosure complaint was filed, PennyMac asked the circuit court for “leave 
to supplement the record to support its (or its predecessor’s), 
standing to commence this action.” 
  At the hearing on Godinez’s motion to dismiss for lack of standing, the circuit court applied the law of the case 
doctrine to the issue of standing and orally denied Godinez’s motion.  The circuit court further discussed that in the 
interest of justice and judicial efficiency, the recent Reyes-
Toledo decision did not warrant dismissal, and the court allowed 
PennyMac an opportunity to supplement the record to support its 
standing.  Upon receipt of PennyMac’s supplemental Reyes-Toledo 
declaration, on November 22, 2017, the circuit court entered written findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an order granting PennyMac’s motion for summary judgment.  Accordingly, 
the circuit court issued the Foreclosure Decree and Judgment, 
appointing a Commissioner to oversee the sale.   ***  FOR  PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 Godinez did not appeal the order granting summary 
judgment or the Foreclosure Decree and Judgment.  Instead, on 
January 16, 2018, Godinez filed a pro se HRCP Rule 60(b) motion for relief from the Foreclosure Decree.  In the motion, Godinez 
alleged, inter alia, that newly discovered evidence rendered the 
Foreclosure Decree void and showed that PennyMac lacked 
standing.  She maintained that the evidence was “newly 
discovered” because her previous attorney had “overlooked it.”   
  PennyMac responded to Godinez’s HRCP Rule 60(b) motion 
and argued, “all of the alleged new evidence could have been discovered by [Godinez] at any time prior to the entry of the 
Foreclosure [Decree], are not admissible or credible, and are 
not controlling in nature as to change the outcome of the 
Court’s ruling.”   
  The circuit court summarily denied Godinez’s HRCP Rule 
60(b) motion, and Godinez filed a timely notice of appeal.   C. ICA Summary Disposition Order 
  The ICA affirmed the circuit court in a Summary 
Disposition Order, noting that Godinez made “no discernible 
argument on appeal” that the circuit court abused its discretion 
in denying Godinez’s HRCP Rule 60(b) motion.  Further, the ICA 
held that “Godinez’s failure to appeal from the Foreclosure 
Decree and Judgment barred Godinez from now challenging PennyMac’s standing under the doctrine of res judicata,” citing ***  FOR  PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
7 
 this court’s decision in Wise.  (Emphasis added.)  However, 
recognizing that res judicata could not be applied to void 
judgments, the ICA also observed, “[l]ack of standing does not render a court’s judgment void under HRCP Rule 60(b),” and 
quoted from this court’s decision in Tax Foundation of Hawaiʻ i v. 
State, 144 Hawaiʻ i 175, 188, 439 P.3d 127, 140 (2019): “[i]n 
Hawaiʻi state courts, standing is a prudential consideration 
. . . and is not an issue of subject matter jurisdiction.”  
Accordingly, the ICA concluded that the circuit court did not 
abuse its direction in denying Godinez’s HRCP Rule 60(b) motion.   
Godinez filed an application for writ of certiorari 
asking this court to review one question: whether the ICA erred in holding that res judicata barred her from arguing that the 
plaintiff lacked standing in an HRCP Rule 60(b) motion.   
III.
 STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Res Judicata 
  “Application of res judicata is a question of law.  
Questions of law are reviewed de novo under the right/wrong 
standard.”  Eastern Sav. Bank, FSB v. Esteban, 129 Hawaiʻ i 154, 
157, 296 P.3d 1062, 1065 (2013) (citations omitted). 
B. HRCP Rule 60(b) 
  A circuit court’s decision on an HRCP Rule 60(b) 
motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion:   ***  FOR  PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
8 
 [T]he trial court has a very large measure of discretion in 
passing upon motions under [HRCP] Rule 60(b) and its order 
will not be set aside unless we are persuaded that under 
the circumstances of the particular case, the court’s 
refusal to set aside its order was an abuse of discretion. 
 
Hawaiʻi Hous. Auth. v. Uyehara, 77 Hawaiʻ i 144, 147, 883 P.2d 65, 
68 (1994) (citations omitted). 
“The burden of establishing abuse of discretion [in 
denying an HRCP Rule 60(b) motion] is on the appellant, and a 
strong showing is required to establish it.”  Ditto v. McCurdy, 
103 Hawaiʻ i 153, 162, 80 P.3d 974, 983 (2003). 
IV. DISCUSSION 
A.
 Res Judicata Did Not Preclude Godinez’s HRCP Rule 60(b) 
Motion 
  We have often recognized that “[a]ccording to the 
doctrine of res judicata, the judgment of a court of competent 
jurisdiction is a bar to a new action in any court between the 
same parties or their privies concerning the same subject 
matter[.]”  Kauhane v. Acutron Co., 71 Haw. 458, 463, 795 P.2d 
276, 278 (1990) (alterations and citation omitted).  A party 
asserting res judicata has the burden of establishing: “(1) 
there was a final judgment on the merits, (2) both parties are 
the same or in privity with the parties in the original suit, 
and (3) the claim decided in the original suit is identical with 
the one presented in the action in question.”  Bremer v. Weeks, 
104 Hawaiʻ i 43, 54, 85 P.3d 150, 161 (2004).  As we discussed in ***  FOR  PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
9 
 Kauhane, the purpose of res judicata is to preclude successive 
litigation: 
 The purpose of the doctrine of res judicata is to 
prevent a multiplicity of suits and to provide a limit to 
litigation.  It serves to relieve parties of the cost and 
vexation of multiple lawsuits, conserve judicial resources, 
and, by preventing inconsistent decisions, encourage 
reliance on adjudication.  The res judicata doctrine thus furthers the interests of litigants, the judicial system 
and society by bringing an end to litigation where matters 
have already been tried and decided on the merits.  It is a 
rule of fundamental and substantial justice, of public 
policy and private peace. 
 
 The doctrine therefore permits every litigant to have 
an opportunity to try his case on the merits; but it also 
requires that he be limited to one such opportunity.  
Unsatisfied litigants have a remedy: they can appeal through available channels.  But they cannot, even if the 
first suit may appear to have been decided wrongly, file 
new suits. 
 
Kauhane, 71 Haw. at 463, 795 P.2d 278–79 (emphases added) 
(citations and alterations omitted).   
  By definition, the doctrine of res judicata only 
applies to new suits: It is inapplicable in a continuation of 
the same suit.  18 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, & Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice & Procedure § 4404 (3d ed. 
2020) (“Res judicata applies as between separate actions, not within the confines of a single action on trial or appeal.”); 
cf. Ditto, 98 Hawaiʻ i at 128 n.6, 44 P.3d at 279 n.6 (2002) 
(noting that the doctrine of collateral estoppel5 was 
                     
5  In the past, the term “res judicata” was used to describe both 
claim preclusion (res judicata) and issue preclusion (collateral estoppel).  
See Exotics Hawaiʻi-Kona, Inc. v. E.I. Dupont De Nemours & Co., 104 Hawaiʻi 
358, 365 n.14, 90 P.3d 250, 257 n.14 (2004) (noting that the lack of 
distinction between the terms can lead to confusion).  However, we have since 
clarified that, though “Hawaiʻ i appellate cases may have conflated the two ***  FOR  PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
10 
 inapplicable where the issues involved “essentially a 
continuation of the same suit and same claim”); see also 
Esteban, 129 Hawaiʻ i at 159, 296 P.3d at 1067 (applying res 
judicata based on a “previous lawsuit”); Bremer, 104 Hawaiʻ i at 
54, 85 P.3d at 161 (same, as to “original suit”); Kauhane, 71 
Haw. at 464, 795 P.2d at 279 (“both actions”); In re Bishop, 36 
Haw. 403, 416 (Haw. Terr. 1943) (“new action”). 
  Accordingly, the determinative question on appeal is whether Godinez’s post-judgment HRCP Rule 60(b) motion was a new 
action or a continuation of the same action.  We conclude that 
that Godinez’s HRCP Rule 60(b) motion was a continuation of the 
foreclosure decree and judgment, and therefore the ICA erred by 
applying the doctrine of res judicata. 
1. An HRCP Rule 60(b) motion is a continuation of the 
action 
  Although we have not addressed whether an HRCP Rule 
60(b) motion is a continuation of the original action, we have acknowledged that the primary purpose of the motion “is to 
authorize the reopening of a closed case or a final order.”  Cho 
v. State, 115 Hawaiʻ i 373, 383, 168 P.3d 17, 27 (2007) (emphasis 
                     
doctrines,” “[c]laim preclusion and issue preclusion are . . . separate 
doctrines that involve distinct questions of law.”  Esteban, 129 Hawaiʻ i at 
158, 158 n.8, 296 P.3d at 1066, 1066 n.8.  Nevertheless, even if the ICA 
intended the term “res jud icata” to refer to issue preclusion, the result is 
the same because, as we explained in Ditto, both doctrines apply only in a 
second, subsequent case.  98 Hawaiʻ i at 128 n.6, 44 P.3d at 279 n .6.   ***  FOR  PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
11 
 and citation omitted).  We now clarify that an HRCP Rule 60(b) 
motion is a continuation of the original action.   
HRCP Rule 60(b) permits a party to seek relief from a 
“final judgment, order, or proceeding”: 
On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may 
relieve a party or a party’s legal representative from a 
final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable 
neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence which by due 
diligence could not have been discovered in time to move 
for a new trial under Rule 59(b); (3) fraud (whether 
heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party; 
(4) the judgment is void; (5) the judgment has been 
satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior judgment 
upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise 
vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application; or (6) any other 
reason justifying relief from the operation of the 
judgment.  The motion shall be made within a reasonable 
time, and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not more than one 
year after the judgment, order, or proceeding was entered or taken.  A motion under this subdivision (b) does not 
affect the finality of a judgment or suspend its operation.  
 
  Under the federal equivalent of HRCP Rule 60(b),6 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) Rule 60(b), federal 
courts have recognized that an FRCP Rule 60(b) motion is 
“considered ancillary to or a continuation of the original 
suit[.]”  Smith v. Widman Trucking & Excavating, Inc., 627 F.2d 
792, 799 (7th Cir. 1980); see Charter Twp. of Muskegon v. City 
of Muskegon, 303 F.3d 755, 762-63 (6th Cir. 2002) (“[S]o long as 
the Rule 60 claim is one which seeks relief from judgment, it is 
                     
6   “Rule 60 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) is 
essentially identical to HFCR Rule 60.  Therefore, authorities interpreting 
the Federal Rules are ‘highly persuasive.’”  Thomas- Yukimura v. Yukimura, 130 
Hawaiʻi 1, 7 n.16, 304 P.3d 1182, 1188 n.16 (2013) (citation omitted).  
 ***  FOR  PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
12 
 not considered an independent claim[.]”); Bankers Mortgage Co. 
v. United States, 423 F.2d 73, 78 (5th Cir. 1970); see also 12 
Moore’s Federal Practice - Civil § 60.61 (3d ed. 2020) (“A[n FRCP] Rule 60(b) motion is considered a continuation of the 
original proceeding.”).   
  The Restatement (Second) of Judgments provides: “The [Rule 60(b)] motion is to be distinguished from a separate 
action, . . . to set aside a judgment, and from an attack on a 
judgment made defensively when the judgment in question is 
relied upon by an opposing party in the course of a subsequent action.”  Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 78 Relief by 
Motion (Am. Law. Inst. 2020) (emphasis added).  With regard to both state and federal Rule 60(b) motions, the Restatement notes 
that “in most jurisdictions[,] the motion is regarded as a 
continuation of the original action[.]”  Id.  
PennyMac claims that “an appeal of an order disposing 
of a Rule 60(b) motion cannot be used [as] a vehicle to 
challenge an underlying judgment,” and similarly argues that 
Godinez “is not permitted in a Rule 60(b) motion to collaterally attack the lower court’s conclusion that Respondent had standing 
when Petitioner could have complained of that conclusion and the 
judgment thereon on direct appeal.”  “A collateral attack ‘is an 
attempt to impeach a judgment or decree in a proceeding not 
instituted for the express purpose of annulling, correcting or ***  FOR  PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
13 
 modifying such judgment or decree.’”  Kim v. Reilly, 105 Hawai‘ i 
93, 96, 94 P.3d 648, 651 (2004).  A Rule 60(b) motion is 
therefore not a “collateral attack” — the purpose of Rule 60(b) is to provide a mechanism for challenging a final judgment.  
HRCP Rule 60(b) (“On motion . . . the court may relieve a party 
or a party’s legal representative from a final judgment. . .”); 
see also Watts v. Pinckney, 752 F.2d 406, 410 (9th Cir. 1985) 
(noting a Rule 60(b) motion is a direct attack on a judgment). 
In sum, we conclude that Godinez’s HRCP Rule 60(b) 
motion was not a new action but rather a continuation of the original foreclosure case. 
2. Res judicata does not apply to an HRCP Rule 60(b) 
motion 
  Godinez asserts the ICA erred in holding that res judicata barred her HRCP Rule 60(b) motion.  She argues, “To 
hold that a Rule 60(b) motion is precluded under the doctrine of 
res judicata defies logic, procedure, is contrary to and 
inconsistent with [Wise], and in effect would completely nullify 
Rule 60(b).”  She further argues, “Courts have long held that direct attacks on judgments under Rule 60(b) are not subject to res judicata,” citing a case from the Supreme Court of Alaska, 
Dixon v. Pouncy, 979 P.2d 520, 523-24 (Alaska 1999), which in 
turn cited cases from the Sixth and Ninth Circuit Courts of ***  FOR  PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
14 
 Appeal.
  We agree with Godinez and hold that the ICA erred in 
applying res judicata to her HRCP Rule 60(b) motion.   
  As Godinez notes, a number of other states have held 
that res judicata generally does not apply to Rule 60(b) 
motions.  See, e.g., Jones v. Murphy, 772 A.2d 502, 505 (Vt. 
2001); Dixon, 979 P.2d at 524; New Maine Nat. Bank v. Nemon, 588 
A.2d 1191, 1194 (Me. 1991); Pepper v. Zions First Nat. Bank, 
N.A., 801 P.2d 144, 150-51 (Utah 1990).  Federal courts have 
likewise recognized that res judicata generally does not bar 
FRCP Rule 60(b) motions.  See Watts, 752 F.2d at 410 (“Res 
judicata does not preclude a litigant from making a direct 
attack under Rule 60(b) upon the judgment before the court which 
rendered it.” (alteration omitted) (quoting Jordon v. Gilligan, 
500 F.2d 701, 710 (6th Cir. 1974)); cf. Estrada–Rodriguez v. 
Lynch, 825 F.3d 397, 402 (8th Cir. 2016) (“Collateral estoppel 
does not apply here because the . . . issue was not previously determined by a valid and final judgment in a prior action 
. . . .  Instead, the . . . issue was determined at an earlier stage of the same action and was reconsidered pursuant to the 
reopening of the action.”).  As the United States Supreme Court 
observed, “[i]t is clear that res judicata and collateral 
estoppel do not apply if a party moves the rendering court in 
the same proceeding to correct or modify its judgment.”  Arizona 
v. California, 460 U.S. 605, 619 (1983). ***  FOR  PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
15 
   PennyMac argues res judicata bars Godinez from 
relitigating the issue of standing, relying on a case from the 
Supreme Court of Ohio, Bank of America, N.A. v. Kuchta, 21 
N.E.3d 1040, 1045-47 (Ohio 2014), and an unpublished ICA 
decision, Wells Fargo Bank N.A. v. Lacuesta, No. CAAP-14-
0001121, 2017 WL 2117678, at *2 (Haw. App. May 15, 2017), which cited to Kuchta.  In Kuchta, the court held that res judicata 
barred borrowers from challenging standing by filing a Rule 60(b) motion.  Id. at 1045.  However, the Kuchta decision goes 
against the weight of authority on this issue, and so we find it 
unpersuasive. 
  In concluding res judicata applied to Godinez’s HRCP Rule 60(b) motion, the ICA relied on our decision in Mortgage 
Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. v. Wise, 130 Hawaiʻ i 11, 
304 P.3d 1192 (2013).  But Wise does not control here because it 
involved a separate proceeding in which the doctrine of res judicata was properly applied.
7 
  As we explained in Wise, “mortgage foreclosure 
proceedings may be treated as analogous to two separate 
proceedings for res judicata purposes” because of their 
                     
 7   We recognize that the ICA has applied res judicata as a bar to 
HRCP Rule 60(b) motions within the foreclosure context in numerous cases.  
See, e.g., Bank of Am., N.A. v. Panzo, Nos. CAAP- 14-0001356, CAAP- 15-0000660, 
2017 WL 1194002 ( Haw. App. March 31, 2017); Nationstar Mortg. LLC v. 
Boonstra, No. CAAP- 18-0000583, 2019 WL 2441427 ( Haw. App. June 12, 2019).  
Our decision today does not disturb those prior decisions that have become 
final. ***  FOR  PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
16 “bifurcated nature[.]”  Id. at 17, 304 P.3d at 1198 (emphasis 
added).  As a result, we held that “res judicata would preclude 
[p]etitioners from challenging [r]espondent’s standing in their  
appeal from the order confirming sale” because “challenges to  
[r]espondent’s standing were subsumed under the foreclosure  
judgment, which had [become] final and binding.”  Id. (emphasis  
added).  Wise said nothing about Rule 60(b) motions, which we  
had previously recognized could be filed even after a  
foreclosure decree became final.  Beneficial Hawai ‘i, Inc. v.  
Casey, 98 Hawai ‘i 159, 166, 45 P.3d 359, 366 (2002) (analyzing  
the merits of issues raised in a Rule 60(b) motion filed eleven  
months after the foreclosure decree entered).
 Thus, our decision in Wise did not dispense with res 
judicata’s separate-action-or-proceeding requirement.  Rather, 
Wise reinforced the notion that res judicata only applies 
between separate actions or proceedings.  130 Hawai ʻi at 19 n.12,

As Godinez argues, her HRCP Rule 60(b) motion was

Judgment.  It was filed before the commencement of any***  FOR  PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 foreclosure sale or the inception of a separate action to 
confirm the sale.   Under these circumstances, Wise was 
inapplicable and res judicata did not preclude Godinez from 
challenging standing.  Accordingly, the ICA erred in this 
regard.  8
B. The ICA Correctly Affirmed the Circuit Court’s Denial of 
Godinez’s Rule 60(b) Motion 
  Notwithstanding the incorrect application of res 
judicata, the ICA properly concluded that the circuit court did 
not abuse its discretion in denying Godinez’s HRCP Rule 60(b) 
motion.  Trial courts are vested with “a very large measure of 
discretion” in deciding HRCP Rule 60(b) motions, Hawaiʻ i Housing 
Authority v. Uyehara, 77 Hawaiʻ i 144, 147, 883 P.2d 65, 68 
(1994), and, as the ICA recognized, “Godinez makes no 
discernible argument on appeal as to whether the [c]ircuit 
[c]ourt abused its discretion in entering the Order Denying 
Relief[.]”   
  Godinez argues for the first time in her application 
for writ of certiorari that relief is warranted under HRCP Rule 
60(b)(6), the rule’s catch-all provision, which authorizes 
                     
8 As discussed below, the circuit court retains discretion to deny 
an HRCP Rule 60(b) motion even without application of res judicata.  Thus, if 
Godinez had filed her motion after the foreclosure sale took place (or even 
just shortly before), the c ircuit court could have denied the motion as 
untimely because Rule 60(b) motions must be filed within a “reasonable time” 
or, alternatively, because a lender or third- party would be prejudiced by 
overturning the judgment.  See 11 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, & 
Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice & Procedure § 2857 (3d ed. 2020).   ***  FOR  PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 relief for “any other reason justifying relief from the 
operation of the judgment,” based on PennyMac’s lack of 
standing.  Relying on our decision in Tax Foundation, 144 Hawai‘ i 
at 192, 439 P.3d at 144, Godinez asserts that lack of standing 
is grounds for relief under HRCP Rule 60(b)(6), “especially as 
this [c]ourt has identified standing . . . [as] one of the 
‘prudential considerations of judicial self-governance.’”   
  In response, PennyMac argues Godinez waived all of her arguments that relief was warranted under any provision of HRCP 
Rule 60(b).  But even if Godinez had not, “[t]here are simply no 
extraordinary circumstances that warrant extraordinary relief 
under HRCP Rule 60(b)(6).”  We agree.  
1. Godinez’s argument that PennyMac lacked standing does 
not constitute “extraordinary circumstances”  
  A party seeking relief under HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) after 
the time for appeal has run must establish the existence of 
“extraordinary circumstances” that prevented or rendered them 
unable to prosecute an appeal.  Uyehara, 77 Hawaiʻ i at 148–49, 
883 P.2d at 69–70.  This is because HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) “is not 
for the purpose of relieving a party from free, calculated and 
deliberate choices [they have] made.”  Id. at 149, 883 P.2d at 
70 (quoting In re Hana Ranch Co., 3 Haw. App. 141, 147, 642 P.2d 
938, 942 (1982)).  ***  FOR  PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 Godinez has not demonstrated “extraordinary 
circumstances” sufficient for the relief requested.  The record 
does not support Godinez’s claim that PennyMac lacked standing.  The circuit court found that PennyMac had standing after 
PennyMac filed a declaration to comply with our decision in 
Reyes-Toledo.  Given the circuit court’s unchallenged findings,
9 
Godinez has failed to demonstrate how the court abused its discretion in denying her HRCP Rule 60(b) motion. 
2. The circuit court did not abuse its discretion by 
declining to reverse previously decided issues 
  “[A] fundamental precept of common-law adjudication is 
that an issue once determined by a competent court is 
conclusive.”  Arizona, 460 U.S. at 619.  This “general 
principle[] of finality and repose” is embodied in the law of the case doctrine, which provides that “when a court decides 
upon a rule of law, that decision should continue to govern the 
same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.”  Id. at 618.  
                     
9   Had there been reliable evidence that PennyMac lacked entitlement 
to enforce the promissory note because its predecessor- in-interest did not 
possess the note at the time the complaint was filed, a different outcome 
could be warranted.  See Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawaiʻi at 369, 390 P.3d at 1256 
(describing standing as a necessary safeguard given the “widespread problems 
created by the securitization of mortgages”); see also Deutsche Bank Nat. 
Trust Co. v. Johnston, 369 P.3d 1046, 1053 (N.M. 2016) (“Under these 
circumstances, not even the plaintiffs may be sure if they actually own the 
notes they seek to enforce.”).  For example, issues related to standing could 
justify HRCP Rule 60(b) relief based on fraud or newly discovered evidence.  However, not only has Godinez failed to demonstrate entitlement to relief 
under those sections of HRCP Rule 60(b), she has abandoned those arguments on 
appeal.  Accordingly, Godinez has failed to demonstrate “extraordinary 
circumstances” sufficient to justify relief. ***  FOR  PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 Accordingly, the circuit court was within its discretion to 
leave an issue it had already decided undisturbed. 
 
 We have previously addressed the law of the case 
doctrine only as applied by lower courts on remand after an 
appeal.  E.g., Ditto, 98 Hawaiʻ i at 128, 44 P.3d at 279.  The 
doctrine can also be invoked by a trial court with respect to 
its own rulings, and in that instance, the doctrine is 
discretionary and operates as a presumption against 
reconsideration.10  18B Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, & 
Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice & Procedure § 4478.1 (2d ed. 
2020).  Here, in adjuicating Godinez’s motion to dismiss for 
lack of standing, which was filed prior to Godinez’s Rule 60(b) 
motion, the circuit court refused to reconsider the issue based 
on the law of the case doctrine.  It would not have been an abuse of discretion for the court to apply the same rule when 
faced with the same question in Godinez’s Rule 60(b) motion.   
Godinez fully litigated the question of standing 
before the trial court, filing numerous motions, challenging the 
documents submitted by PennyMac, and arguing the issue before 
                     
10  By contrast, when “the law of the case” has been established by 
an appellate court, the lower court is obliged to apply it.  Ditto, 98 Hawaiʻ i 
at 128, 44 P.3d at 279; s ee also Weinberg v. Mauch, 78 Hawaiʻ i 40, 47, 890 
P.2d 277, 284 (1995) (“The doctrine of the law of the case states that a 
determination of a question of law made by an appellate court in the course 
of an action becomes the law of the case and may not be disputed by a 
reopening of the question at a later stage of litigation.” (citations and 
quotation marks omitted)).  ***  FOR  PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 the court at the summary judgment hearing as well as at the 
hearing on her motion to dismiss after this court decided Reyes-
Toledo.  Nothing in the record suggests that Godinez did not 
have a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue.  And, as the ICA noted, Godinez failed to timely appeal from the circuit 
court’s summary judgment order.   
  Accordingly, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying Godinez’s HRCP Rule 60(b) motion, and the 
ICA properly affirmed the circuit court’s decision. 
V. CONCLUSION 
  Subject to the foregoing clarification, we affirm the 
ICA’s January 10, 2020 Judgment on Appeal.
