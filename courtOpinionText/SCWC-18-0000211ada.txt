This appeal arises from rulings concerning child custody

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Family Court of the First Circuit (“family court”)1 in a divorce 
proceeding. 
DL asserts that in its February 28, 2019 summary 
disposition order (“SDO”) the Intermediate Court of Appeals 
(“ICA”) erred by (1)(a) considering the family court’s April 26, 2018 amended findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding 
child custody despite its entry of some findings of fact 
regarding child custody before the March 26, 2018 notice of appeal, as the family court was without jurisdiction to enter 
additional findings after the notice of appeal had been filed; 
and (b) not properly considering DL’s arguments that even if the family court had jurisdiction to enter them, the April 26, 2018 findings and conclusions should be rejected; (2) affirming the 
family court’s denial of its motion to disqualify CL’s counsel 
and law firm; and (3) affirming the family court’s grant of sole physical custody of the parties’ minor children to CL and 
allowing CL to relocate the children to Arizona. 
For the reasons explained below, the ICA did not err. We 
therefore affirm the ICA’s May 3, 2019 judgment affirming the 
family court’s (1) April 26, 2018 amended findings of fact, 
conclusions of law and order regarding:  June 21, 2017 Order Re: 
 1   The Honorable Gale L.F. Ching presided.

Defendant’s Motion for Pre-Decree Relief; March 13, 2016 Order Re: Evidentiary Hearing; and March 16, 2018 First Amended Order 
Re: Evidentiary Hearing; and (2) April 23, 2018 findings of 
fact, conclusions of law, and order regarding Plaintiff’s Motion to Disqualify Counsel. 
II. Background 
A. Family court proceedings 
DL and CL were married and had two children, who had yet to 
enter kindergarten as of the 2016 commencement of divorce 
proceedings. Before the divorce proceedings began, CL had moved 
to Arizona with the two minor children. 
Various proceedings and hearings then took place in the 
family court, including DL’s filing of a motion to disqualify counsel for CL and his law firm. DL contended disqualification 
was required because CL’s law firm had hired a family law 
paralegal who had been employed by the law firm that previously 
represented DL in the divorce case.  DL alleged the paralegal 
had participated in DL’s case and was privy to privileged communications and other confidential information related to DL’s case. 
DL’s prior law firm indicated that although the paralegal 
had not worked on DL’s matter, DL’s case was discussed during the firm’s family law department monthly meetings in which the  
 4 
    
  
 
  
 
  
 
   
   
 
    
  
   
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
paralegal participated, and that the paralegal had received 
email regarding DL’s case. CL’s new law firm attested, however, 
that it had taken appropriate steps to screen the paralegal from 
any work or information related to DL’s case after the paralegal’s employment, including filtering the mail to ensure that pleadings regarding the matter would not be given to the 
paralegal, that the paralegal’s computer could not access any of 
the files in the case, and by instructing staff to exclude the paralegal from all communications regarding the case.  On 
October 17, 2017, the family court denied DL’s motion to 
disqualify.  The family court did not enter findings of fact or conclusions of law in the order denying disqualification. 
Meanwhile, other proceedings and hearings ensued regarding 
other issues in the divorce, including child custody. On March 
13, 2018, the family court entered its “Order Re:  Evidentiary hearing” concerning hearings it had conducted on eleven dates 
from July 31, 2017 to January 8, 2018. These hearings addressed 
not only legal and physical custody of the children, but also child support, alimony, property division as to certain properties, debts, and attorney fees. 
With respect to legal and physical custody of the children 
only, the March 13, 2018 order contained a section entitled “findings of fact,” reflecting twelve findings of fact within  
  
 . . . . 
5 
   
  
    
   
 
    
  
  
  
   
 
 
  
   
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2   HRS § 571- 46(a)(9) (2018) provides:  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
two pages of the seventeen-page order. The twelve findings of 
fact were as follows: 
1. [DL] and [CL] were married [in] 2008,
2. [DL] and [CL] are the natural parents of the minor [children],3. [DL] and [CL] are [] employable,4. Previously, [DL] and [CL] were living and working in 
California and decided to relocate to Hawaii,
5. In approximately October 2015, [DL] and [CL] moved to 
Hawaii where they lived in a cottage [] owed [sic] by [DL]’ s parents,
6. During the course of the marriage, [DL] verbally abused 
[CL] and engaged in emotional and physical acts of violence 
in the presence of the [CL] and the [m]inor [c]hildren, 
7. On or about July 9, 2016 [CL] fled with the [ m]inor 
[c]hildren to Arizona in order to protect herself and the [m]inor [c]hildren,
2 
8. [CL] presently lives in Arizona and has obtained [] 
employment [],9. [DL] presently lives in Hawaii and has obtained [] 
employment [], 
(9) In every proceeding where there is at issue a dispute
as to the custody of a child, a determination by the court 
that family violence has been committed by a parent raisesa rebuttable presumption that it is detrimental to thechild and not in the best interest of the child to be placed in sole custody, joint legal custody, or joint 
physical custody with the perpetrator of family violence.
In addition to other factors that a court shall consider in a proceeding in which the custody of a child or visitationby a parent is at issue, and in which the court has made afinding of family violence by a parent:
(A) The court shall consider as the primary factor thesafety and well- being of the child and of the parent who is 
the victim of family violence;(B) The court shall consider the perpetrator's history ofcausing physical harm, bodily injury, or assault or causing 
reasonable fear of physical harm, bodily injury, or assault
to another person; and(C) If a parent is absent or relocates because of an act offamily violence by the other parent, the absence orrelocation shall not be a factor that weighs against the 
parent in determining custody or visitation; 
 6 
  
  
  
 
 
 
  
   
  
 
3   According to DL, these included, but were not limited to, the (1)
“Order Re: Plaintiff’s Motion to Disqualify Counsel, Filed October 6, 2017,”
filed October 17, 2017; (2) “Order Re: Defendant’s Motion and Declaration for Pre- Decree Relief Filed June 7, 2017,” filed June 21, 2017; (3) “Order 
Granting In Part and Denying in Part Motion and Declaration for Pre -Decree 
Relief, Filed October 21, 2016,” filed December 16, 2018; (4) “Order Granting 
In Part and Denying in Part Plaintiff’s Motion to Permit Visitati  on in 
Hawaii, Filed December 8, 2016,” filed December 16, 2016; and (5) “Order,
Exhibit A,” filed September 22, 2016.  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
10. At present, [one of] the minor child[ren] is attending[an] [e]lementary [s]chool and the [other] minor child []is attending [a pre] [s]chool,
11. [DL] has sought counseling for domestic violence,
parenting, etc. [sic] and does not now pose a danger nor a 
safety risk to the [m]inor [c]hildren, and 
12. The [p]arties are unable to effectively communicate forthe benefit of the [m]inor [c]hildren. 
The family court awarded joint legal custody to DL and CL.  As 
CL had relocated to Arizona before the divorce proceedings, the  
family court awarded CL sole physical custody.   
On March 16, 2018, the family court entered a  “First 
Amended Order Re:  Evidentiary Hearing” without amending the findings of fact relating to child custody or its custody orders  
contained in the March 13 order.   (The March 13 and 16 orders 
are collectively referred to as the “March Orders.”)   Neither of
the March Orders contained a section entitled “Conclusions of Law.”   
 
B. Family court and ICA proceedings after notice of appeal 
DL filed a notice of appeal of the March Orders as well as
all prior rulings upon which they were predicated
  on March 26, 
2018. On April 3, 2018, the family court ordered both parties 3  
 7 
   
  
  
 
  
  
   
 
  
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law 
pursuant to Hawaiʻi Family Court Rules (“HFCR”) Rule 52(a) (2015) 
by April 20, 2018
. 
Meanwhile, on April 9, 2018, in the family court, c
ounsel 
for DL filed a motion to stay enforcement of a portion of the 
March Orders that required a property to be listed for sale. 
Pursuant to the family court’s April 3, 2018 order, on 
April 20, 2018, counsel for CL submitted four separate proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding the various evidentiary hearings and matters addressed in the March Orders 
and the disqualification motion. On the same date, counsel for 
DL submitted 484 proposed findings of fact and 48 conclusions of law, not including subparts. 
On April 23, 2018, the family court entered four separate 
findings of fact and conclusions of law, adopting verbatim the proposals submitted by CL’s counsel.  The first of the four contained 91 findings of fact and 26 conclusions of law 
primarily focused on child custody and relocation, but which 
also discussed other subjects included in the March Orders (“4/23/18 FOFs/COLs re child custody”). The fourth concerned  
 8 
    
  
   
 
     
  
 
  
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
DL’s motion to disqualify counsel (“4/23/18 FOFs/COLs re motion 
to disqualify”).4 
At 1:32 p.m. on April 26, 2018, the family court entered a 
divorce decree. At 3:28 p.m. on April 26, 2018, the family 
court entered a document entitled “first amended findings of fact and conclusions of law,” which replaced the first of the 
four findings of fact and conclusions of law it had entered on 
April 23, 2018, which basically concerned child custody and relocation. The “first amended findings of fact and conclusions 
of law” did not amend the 91 findings of fact and 26 conclusions 
of law entered on April 23, 2018; it merely added a child support guidelines worksheet and property division chart as attachments (“4/26/18 FOFs/COLs re child custody”). 
The child custody and relocation rulings within the 4/26/18 
FOFs/COLs re child custody and the 4/23/18 FOFs/COLs regarding DL’s motion to disqualify are the subject of these certiorari 
proceedings.
5 
4 The second of the four findings of fact and conclusions of law 
concerned the family court’s September 22, 2016 order on DL’s motion for pre-
decree relief. The third concerned the family court’s December 16, 2016order regarding another motion for pre -decree relief filed by DL and a 
December 8, 2016 order regarding DL’s motions to permit visitation in Hawaiʻ i. 
5 On July 5, 2018, DL filed another notice of appeal, which is the 
subject of CAAP- 18-0000536.  
 9 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
As noted earlier, the March Orders contained 12 cursory 
findings regarding child custody and relocation and contained no 
“conclusions of law.” As to custody issues, the 4/26/18 
FOFs/COLs re child custody provided additional factual findings supporting the family court’s custody decisions in the March Orders.  It also contained conclusions of law.  The 4/26/18 
FOFs/COLs re child custody did not, however, substantively 
modify the findings of fact and conclusions of law contained in the original April 23, 2018 findings and conclusions and also 
did not modify substantive rulings regarding custody and 
relocation contained in the March Orders or in the April 26, 2018 divorce decree. 
On May 9, 2018, CL, appearing pro se, filed a motion to 
dismiss DL’s appeal. CL argued that because the divorce decree was not filed until April 26, 2018, DL’s March 26, 2018 notice of appeal was premature. 
On May 16, 2018, DL filed a memorandum opposing CL’s motion 
to dismiss. DL argued that because the family court’s March Orders contained findings of fact, they had the requisite degree 
of finality to be appealable, citing to In re Doe, 102 Hawaiʻi 
246, 250, 74 P.3d 998, 1002 (2003) (“In [family court] cases, an 
order possesses the requisite finality if it determines the ultimate rights of the parties, with respect to distinct matters  
 10 
  
  
 
  
  
  
 
  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
which have no bearing on other matters left for consideration.” ) 
(internal quotation marks omitted). DL contended that the ICA 
therefore had appellate jurisdiction over DL’s appeal from the 
March Orders. 
On June 4, 2018, the ICA entered an order denying CL’s 
motion to dismiss appeal.  It rejected both parties’ arguments 
and ruled that dismissal of the appeal was not appropriate based 
on Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure (“HRAP”) Rule 4(a)(2) 
(2016), which provides, “[i]f a notice of appeal is filed af
ter 
announcement of a decision but before entry of the judgment or 
order, such notice shall be considered as final immediately 
after the time the judgment or order becomes final for the purpose of appeal.” The ICA ruled that based on HRAP Rule 
4(a)(2), the filing of the family court’s April 26, 2018 divorce 
decree, entered after DL filed his March 26, 2018 notice of appeal, allowed it to take jurisdiction over DL’s appeal. The ICA therefore concluded that it had appellate jurisdiction over 
DL’s appeal from the filing of the April 26, 2018 divorce decree 
pursuant to HRS § 571-54 (2006). 
DL’s opening brief was filed on July 25, 2018, and it
asserted two points of error:   
Point of Error Number One: Whether the Family Court erred
in awarding CL sole physical custody of the parties’Children and permitting their relocation to Arizona becausethe evidence did not establish that it was in the 
Children’s best interest to relocate to Arizona or away 
 11 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 With respect to the family court’s grant of sole physical 
custody to CL, DL continued to argue that the family court erred  
when it used HFCR Rule 52 to request additional findings of fact
and conclusions of law where the family court had already entered substantive findings in its March Orders.  In summary, DL also argued that the family court erred in awarding  CL sole 
physical custody of the children and permitting their relocation  
to Arizona because the evidence did not establish that  it was in
the children’s best interests  to relocate to Arizona or away  
from DL.  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
from [ DL], there was neither a finding of family violence 
made against DL nor any evidence of family violence, the
Family Court erred in relying on the Custody Evaluator’s
purported recommendation in favor of relocation, and the
Family Court should not have relied on evidence outside the record in deciding custody and relocation. It was also error for the Family Court to rubber -stamp all findings of 
fact, conclusions of law, and re -written orders submitted 
by CL’s attorney. 
Point of Error Number Two: Whether the Family Court erred 
in denying DL’s motion to disqualify CL’s attorney giventhat both her attorney and his law firm were disqualified
from representing CL after they hired a paralegal formerly
employed by DL’s former counsel who had worked on this caseand had actual exposure to significant privilegedcommunications and other confidential information related to the case, and given that CL’s attorney neither informed
DL that the paralegal had been hired nor obtained DL’s
consent to waive the actual conflict of interest and disqualification, and given that an effective “screen,”even if permitted, cannot be accomplished under thecircumstances. Subsumed within the error is the court’s 
ruling striking unspecified testimony of [the attorney from 
DL’s prior law firm], related to his refreshed recollection further confirming the paralegal’s actual exposure toconfidential information. 
 
 
 
 
With respect to the disqualification issue, in summary, DL  
 12 
    
 
   
 
   
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
argued that pursuant to Hawaiʻi Rules of Professional Conduct 
(“HRPC”) Rule 1.10 (2014) and case law from other jurisdictions, 
CL’s attorney and law firm should have been disqualified from 
representing CL based on the paralegal’s transfer of employment. 
In summary, CL’s September 4, 2018 answering brief argued 
that the family court’s custody decisions should be affirmed based on the voluminous testimony and evidence in the case.  CL 
further argued that the family court’s decision to deny DL’s motion to disqualify was not in error because the new law firm had appropriately screened the paralegal upon the transfer of 
employment. 
DL’s September 28, 2018 reply brief repeated the argument 
that the family court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law after the notice of appeal should not be considered by the ICA.  
Citing Kakinami v. Kakinami, 127 Hawaiʻi 126, 143, 276 P.3d 695, 
712 (2012), DL contended that once a notice of appeal is filed, 
a family court generally loses jurisdiction to modify a 
previously entered order. 
C. ICA ruling 
In its February 28, 2019 SDO, the ICA affirmed the 4/26/18 
FOFs/COLs re child custody as well as the 4/23/18 FOFs/COLs re 
the motion to disqualify. DL v. CL, CAAP-18-0000211 (App. Feb. 
28, 2019) (SDO). The ICA did not specifically address DL’s  
 13 
   
 
     
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
  
  
 
  
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
contention that once a notice of appeal is filed, the family 
court loses jurisdiction to modify a previously entered order 
and was therefore without jurisdiction to enter the 4/26/18 
FOFs/COLs. (It had already ruled in its June 4, 2018 order denying CL’s motion to dismiss the appeal as premature that the appeal was not effective until the filing of the April 26, 2018 
divorce decree.) 
Regarding the family court’s child custody decisions, 
citing Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawaiʻi 41, 47, 137 P.3d 355, 361 
(2006), the ICA noted that under HRS § 571
-46, the sole issue in 
a custody determination is the child’s best interests, and 
concluded that the family court’s custody decisions were supported by substantial evidence. DL, SDO at 7. The ICA noted 
that HRS § 571-46(b) sets forth a non-exclusive list of factors 
the court must consider in determining the best interests of children, and “the family court is granted broad discretion to weigh the various factors involved, with no single factor being 
given presumptive paramount weight, in determining whether the 
standard has been met[,]” quoting Fisher, 111 Hawaiʻi at 50, 137 
P.3d at 364. DL, SDO at 3.  The ICA also referred to the family 
court’s factual findings regarding “family violence” and the 
effect of such findings on custody and relocation. See supra 
note 2 (quoting HRS § 571-46(a)(9)); DL
, SDO at 3-11.  
 14 
   
   
 
   
 
 
  
 
   
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Regarding the disqualification issue, the ICA noted that 
HRPC Rule 1.10, which pertains to the imputation of conflicts of 
interest, does not necessarily prohibit representation by others 
in the law firm where the person prohibited from involvement in a matter is a nonlawyer. DL, SDO at 13-14 (citing HRPC Rule 1.10 cmt. 4).  The ICA further noted the family court’s finding 
that CL’s law firm was aware from the outset that the paralegal 
had a conflict, had prohibited the paralegal from any work on or involvement in the matter, and had ensured that the paralegal 
would be effectively screened. DL, SDO at 15. The ICA ruled 
that, based on the record, it could not conclude that the family 
court abused its discretion in denying DL’s motion to disqualify.  DL, SDO at 16. 
Accordingly, the ICA affirmed the family court and entered 
its judgment on appeal on May 3, 2019. C. Certiorari application 
DL raises the following three questions on certiorari: 
1. Whether the ICA erred by considering and ultimately
approving FOF- COLS drafted exclusively by CL’s counsel, and 
re-written interim orders drafted by CL’s counsel, that 
were entered verbatim, in their entirety, obviously without
any meaningful review of their propriety or accuracy, and
creating an improper moving target after DL filed his 
notice or appeal. 
2. Whether the ICA erred by affirming the family court’s
order denying DL’s motion to disqualify CL’s counsel. 3. Whether the ICA erred in affirming the family court’s
order awarding to CL sole physical custody of the parties’  
 15 
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
   
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
children and allowing CL to relocate the children to 
Arizona. 
III. Standards of Review 
A. Family court decisions 
Generally, the “family court possesses wide discretion in 
making its decisions and those decisions will not be set aside 
unless there is a manifest abuse of discretion.” In Interest of 
Jane Doe, 84 Hawaiʻi 41, 46, 928 P.2d 883, 888 (1996) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). “Under the abuse of 
discretion standard of review, the family court’s decision will not be disturbed unless the family court disregarded rules or 
principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant[, and its] decision clearly exceed[ed] the bounds 
of reason.” 
Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted, 
alterations in original). 
B. Findings of fact and conclusions of law A family court’s findings of fact are reviewed on appeal 
under the “clearly erroneous” standard. Fisher, 111 
Hawaiʻi at 
46, 137 P.3d at 360. “A [finding of fact] is clearly erroneous 
when (1) the record lacks substantial evidence to support the finding, or (2) despite substantial evidence in support of the 
finding, the appellate court is nonetheless left with a definite 
and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.” Id. 
“‘Substantial evidence’ is credible evidence which is of  
 16 
  
 
 
 
   
  
  
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of 
reasonable caution to support a conclusion.” Id. 
“The family court’s [conclusions of law] are reviewed on 
appeal de novo, under the right/wrong standard.”  Id. (citation omitted). Conclusions of law are “not binding upon an appellate court and are freely reviewable for their correctness.” Id. 
(citation omitted). C. Credibility of witnesses “[I]t is well-settled that an appellate court will not pass 
upon issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence; this is the province of the trier of 
fact.” In re Doe, 95 Hawaiʻi 183, 190, 20 P.3d 616, 623 (2001) 
(
internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
D. Interpretation of court rules 
The interpretation of court rules 
involve principles of 
statutory construction. State v. Choy Foo, 142 Hawaiʻi 65, 72, 
414 P.3d 117, 124 (2018). 
This court’s construction of court 
rules is guided by the following: 
First, the fundamental starting point for [rule] 
interpretation is the language of the [rule] itself. 
Second, where the . . . language [of the rule] is plain and unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain 
and obvious meaning. Third, implicit in the task of [rule]
construction is our foremost obligation to ascertain andgive effect to the intention of the [promulgator], which is to be obtained primarily from the language contained in the [rule] itself. Fourth, when there is doubt, doubleness of
meaning, or indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an
expression used in a [rule], an ambiguity exists.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Id. (citations omitted). 
E. Disqualification of counsel 
Appellate courts apply the abuse of discretion standard for 
reviewing a judge’s denial of a motion for 
disqualification. Under the abuse of discretion standard, 
the trial court may not be reversed by an appellate courtunless the trial court clearly exceeded the bounds ofreason or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant. 
Hussey v. Say, 139 Hawaiʻi 181, 185-86, 384 P.3d 1282, 1286-87 
(2016) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). 
IV. Discussion 
A. The ICA did not err by considering and approving the 
4/26/18 FOFs/COLs re child custody 
In the first question on certiorari, DL alleges the ICA 
erred by basing its appellate review on the 4/26/18 FOFs/COLs re 
child custody because (1) the family court was without 
jurisdiction to enter them after the notice of appeal had been 
filed; and (2) even if the family court had jurisdiction to enter the 4/26/18 FOFs/COLs re child custody after DL’s notice 
of appeal, the ICA erred in not properly considering DL’s

1. The family court had jurisdiction to enter the 4/26/18 
FOFs/COLs re child custody 
a. DL’s March 26, 2018 notice of appeal was 
premature 
DL contends that the family court was divested of 
jurisdiction to enter the 4/26/18 FOFs/COLs re child custody  
because this court has stated “that once a party files a notice 
of appeal, a family court is generally divested of jurisdiction 
to proceed further on the matter,” citing Kakinami, 127 Hawaiʻi 
at 143, 276 P.3d at 712.  As indicated in the ICA’s June 4, 2018 
order denying CL’s motion to dismiss the appeal, however, DL’s 
March 2, 2018 notice of appeal was actually premature.    
In Eaton v. Eaton, 7 Haw. App. 111, 748 P.2d 801 (1987),
the ICA ruled:   
Hawaii divorce cases involve a maximum of four discrete 
parts: (1) dissolution of the marriage; (2) child custody, visitation, and support; (3) spousal support; and (4) division and distribution of property and debts. Black v. Black, 6 Haw. App. 493, 728 P.2d 1303 (1986). In Cleveland
v. Cleveland, 57 Haw. 519, 559 P.2d 744 (1977), the Hawaii
Supreme Court held that an order which finally decidesparts (1) and (4) is final and appealable even if part (2)remains undecided. Although we recommend that, except in exceptionally compelling circumstances, all parts be
decided simultaneously and that part (1) not be finally
decided prior to a decision on all the other parts, we conclude that an order which finally decides part (1) is final and appealable when decided even if parts (2), (3), and (4) remain undecided; that parts (2), (3), and (4) are
each separately final and appealable as and when they are 
decided, but only if part (1) has previously or simultaneously been decided; and that if parts (2), (3), and/or (4) have been decided before part (1) has beenfinally decided, they become final and appealable when part
(1) is finally decided.

Eaton, 7 Haw. App. at 118-19, 748 P.2d at 805 (internal footnote 
omitted). 
Thus, according to Eaton, the part (2) child custody order 
within the March Orders was not appealable until the divorce decree was entered on April 26, 2018.  The ICA properly denied CL’s motion to dismiss the premature appeal because HRAP Rule 
4(a)(2) provides that if a notice of appeal is filed before 
entry of a judgment or order, the notice shall be considered as filed immediately after the time the judgment or order becomes 
final for the purpose of appeal. Therefore, the ICA properly 
concluded that it had appellate jurisdiction over DL’s premature 
appeal pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(2) as of the April 26, 2018 filing of the divorce decree. 
DL maintains the ICA erred because an immediate appeal of 
the March Orders was authorized by HRS § 571-54, which allows an appeal “by any interested party, aggrieved by any order or 
decree of the court.” DL, however, ignores the remaining 
portion of the quoted sentence within HRS § 571-54, which provides, “An interested party, aggrieved by any order or decree of the court, may appeal to the intermediate appellate court for 
review of questions of law and fact upon the same terms and 
conditions as in other cases in the circuit court, and review shall be governed by chapter 602, except as hereinafter

 6   HRS § 571- 54 provides in relevant part:  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
provided.”6 HRS § 571-54 (emphasis added). As stated in In re 
Doe, 102 Hawaiʻi 246, 74 P.3d 998 (2003): 
We have construed this language as indicating that HRS 
§ 641–1 (1993)[] which defines the limits of appeals in 
civil actions and proceedings, likewise defines the limitsof judgments, orders, or decrees in family court
proceedings from which an appeal may lie. Specifically, wehave held that, under HRS § 571– 54, we may hear 
appeals from only final orders, or decrees except as otherwise provided by law. 
In re Doe, 102 Hawaiʻi at 249, 74 P.3d at 1001 (emphasis added)  
(internal quotation marks omitted).   
An interested party, aggrieved by any order or decree ofthe court, may appeal to the intermediate appellate courtfor review of questions of law and fact upon the same terms and conditions as in other cases in the circuit court , and
review shall be governed by chapter 602, except as
hereinafter provided. Where the decree or order affects 
the custody of a child or minor, the appeal shall be heard at the earliest practicable time.
The stay of enforcement of an order or decree, or the
pendency of an appeal, shall not suspend the order or
decree of the court regarding a child or minor, 
. . .
unless otherwise ordered by the family court or by the appellate court after an appeal is taken. Pending final disposition of the case, the family court or the appellate
court, after the appeal is taken, may make such order for
temporary custody as is appropriate in thecircumstances. If the appellate court does not dismiss theproceedings and discharge the child or minor, it shallaffirm or modify the order of the family court and remand
the child or minor to the jurisdiction of the court for
disposition not inconsistent with the appellate court’ s 
finding on the appeal.

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
DL relies on language in Kakinami stating “that once a 
party files a notice of appeal, the [family] court is generally 
divested of jurisdiction to proceed further on the matter.” 
Kakinami, 127 Hawaiʻi at 143, 276 P.3d at 712. Kakinami did not 
address a premature notice of appeal and entry of findings of 
fact and conclusions of law under HFCR Rule 52(a). Lowther v. 
Lowther, 99 Hawai‘i 569, 57 P.3d 494 (App. 2002), also did not 
address the entry of findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to HFCR Rule 52(a) after a premature notice of appeal, and instead concerned the family court’s entry of order 
regarding non
-child custody matters while an appeal of prior 
decisions regarding those matters was pending. Lowther, 99 
Hawaiʻi at 569-70, 578-79, 57 P.3d at 494-95, 503-04.  Thus, 
these cases are completely distinguishable. 
DL cites to no authority “otherwise providing by law” that
, 
pursuant to the ICA’s holding in Eaton, a divorce decree was not 
required to render the child custody decisions in the March 
Orders appealable.  There was no order allowing an interlocutory 
appeal. Thus, pursuant to Eaton and HRAP Rule 4(a)(2), it was only upon the April 26, 2018 filing of the divorce decree that DL’s appeal became effective. DL’s premature March 26, 2018 
notice of appeal therefore did not divest the family court of 
jurisdiction to enter its 4/23/18 FOFs/COLS re child custody.  
 22 
    
  
  
 
  
   
  
 
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The 4/26/18 FOFs/COLs did not amend the 4/23/18 FOFs/COLs re
child custody, and merely added a child support guidelines 
worksheet and property division chart as attachments.    
b. In any event, HFCR Rule 52(a) required the family 
court to enter conclusions of law regarding child 
custody, as none had previously been entered 
The March Orders contained 12 findings of fact but no   
conclusions of law regarding the minor children’s best interests 
regarding the family court’s decision to award sole physical custody of the minor children to CL and to allow CL to remain in 
Arizona with the minor children.  
HFCR Rule 52(a) provides as follows: 
(a) Effect. In all actions tried in the family court, the
court may find the facts and state its conclusions of law
thereon or may announce or write and file its decision and
direct the entry of the appropriate judgment; except upon 
notice of appeal filed with the court, the court shallenter its findings of fact and conclusions of law wherenone have been entered, unless the written decision of thecourt contains findings of fact and conclusions of law. To 
aid the court, the court may order the parties or either of
them to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions oflaw, where the written decision of the court does notcontain the findings of fact and conclusions of law, within
10 days after the filing of the notice of appeal, unless 
such time is extended by the court. Requests for findings are not necessary for purposes of review. The findings of a master, to the extent that the court adopts them, shallbe considered as the findings of the court . If a decision 
is filed, it will be sufficient if the findings of fact andconclusions of law appear therein. 
The plain language of HFCR Rule 52(a) therefore requires a  
family court to enter findings of fact and conclusions of law 
after a notice of appeal is filed, unless it has previously 
entered a written decision containing findings of fact and   
 23 
    
 
   
 
  
  
 
   
 
   
  
 
 
   
 
  
  7   HFCR Rule 52(a) therefore differs from Hawaiʻ i  Rules of Civil Procedure 
(“HRCP”) Rule 52(a)(2000), which requires that a circuit court enter findings
of fact and conclusions of law in  all actions tried without a jury before a 
final judgment allowing an appeal is filed.  HRCP Rule 52(a) provides in
pertinent part:  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
conclusions of law.7 As stated by the ICA in State v. Gonsales, 
91 Hawaiʻi 446, 984 P.2d 1272 (App. 1999), “upon the filing of an 
appeal, the family court is mandated, where HFCR Rule 52(a) is applicable, to enter written findings of fact and conclusions, 
unless they were previously set forth in a written decision or 
decision and order.” 91 
Hawaiʻi at 449, 984 P.2d at 1275. 
Although the March 26, 2018 notice of appeal was premature, 
HFCR Rule 52(a) would have required the family court to enter 
conclusions of law regarding child custody at some point, as none were contained in the March Orders. The “best interests” 
standard governs 
child custody decisions.  See HRS § 571-
46(a)(1) (“Custody should be awarded . . . according to the best interest of the child . . . .”). Conclusions of law addressing 
the “best interests” standard were first entered in the 4/23/18 
FOFs/COLs re child custody (which were not amended by the 
4/26/18 FOFs/COLs re child custody). Thus, the March Orders did 
not constitute “a written decision containing findings of fact 
(a) Effect. In all actions tried upon the facts without a
jury or with an advisory jury, the court shall find the
facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law
thereon, and judgment shall be entered pursuant toRule 58 . . . .  
 24 
  
 
 
 We now turn to the second subpart of DL’s first question on
certiorari.  DL asserts that even if the family court had    
jurisdiction to enter the 4/26/18 FOFs/COLs re child custody, 
the ICA erred in not properly considering DL’s arguments that  
they should be rejected because the family court adopted CL’s 
 
   
 
  
  
  
   
 
 
  
  
 8 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
and conclusions of law” that would have obviated the family court’s obligation to prepare conclusions as required by HFCR  
Rule 52(a).
  8 
2. The family court was not prohibited from adopting CL’s
proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law intheir entirety 
 
DL also posits that because the family court had entered cursory 
findings of fact in its March Orders, it was prohibited from entering more
detailed findings of fact after the March 26, 2018 notice of appeal. The 
March 26, 2018 notice of appeal was premature and did not become effective until the April 26, 2018 filing of the divorce decree. The 4/23/18 FOFs rechild custody were entered before the filing of the divorce decree on4/26/18, and the 4/26/18 FOFs re child custody entered a few hours after thedivorce decree did not amend the 4/23/18 FOFs re child custody.  In any
event, HFCR Rule 52(a) does not prohibit a family court from entering 
supplemental findings after a notice of appeal as long as they do not substantively modify pre- appeal findings. Cf. Thomas- Yukimura v. Yukimura, 
130 Hawaiʻ i 1, 304 P.3d 1182 (2013) (holding that a family court cannot 
substantively modify a divorce decree’s apportionment of capital gains taxliability, unless pursuant to HFCR Rules 52(b), 59, or 60 ).  
There appear to 
be previous cases in which amended findings and conclusions have been entered pursuant to HFCR Rule 52(a) after the filing of a notice of appeal. See,e.g., Ferreira v. Ferreira, No. 28912 (App. Nov. 18, 2009) (mem.); R.N. v. 
B.F., No. 28241 (App. June 6, 2008) (SDO); In re Doe, No. 26276 (App. Mar. 9, 
2005) (SDO). Also, allowing the entry of more detailed supplemental findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to HFCR Rule 52(a) as long as they donot substantively modify a family court’s pre -decree rulings allows for a 
more informed and timely appellate review.  One of the purposes for the 
statutory requirement that an agency set forth its findings of fact and
conclusions of law is to enable judicial review. Dupree v. Hiraga, 121 
Hawaiʻ i 297, 309 n.14, 219 P.3d 1084, 1096 n.14 (2009).  Also, “findings of 
fact promote reasoned decisions and meaningful appellate review.” State v. 
Hussein, 122 Hawaiʻ i 495, 505 n.15, 229 P.3d 313, 323 n.15 (2010).  
 25 
  
    
     
 
     
 
  
   
 
 9    DL also cites to the Georgia case Floyd v. Gibson, 788  S.E.2d 84, 87-
88 (Ga. Ct. App. 2016) for the proposition that if the record contains 
indicia, such as repeated typographical errors, that suggest the judge did
not even read the submissions, the findings should be rejected and the judgment vacated.  Instead, this case appears to stand for a relatedproposition that an appellate court “cannot apply the appropriate deferential
standard of review to the trial court’s findings of fact when it is entirely
unclear that the trial court even made any such findings, or where it failed 
to base its findings, to the extent any were made, on contemporaneous
evidence.”  Floyd, 78 8 S.E.2d at 88.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
submissions verbatim, suggesting the family court had not even 
read the submissions. For this assertion, DL cites to two out-
of-state cases. In a Florida case, West v. West, 228 So.3d 727, 
728 (Fla. Ct. App. 2017), the Florida Court of Appeals stated that an “appearance of impropriety exists” when a trial judge adopts a party’s proposed judgment verbatim, especially where 
the judge did not orally announce findings or rulings during or 
at the end of trial. West, 288 So.3d at 728-29. West, in turn, 
is based on the Florida Supreme Court’s holding in Perlow v. 
Berg-Perlow, 875 So.2d 383 (Fla. 2004), which had set forth 
guidelines for dealing with proposed “judgments” submitted by parties in divorce proceedings. West, 228 So.3d at 729. Perlow 
makes it clear, however, that Florida does not have a rule 
similar to HFCR Rule 52(a), which authorizes a trial court to 
request findings of fact and conclusions of law, although it appears such requests were not uncommon. Perlow, 875 So.2d at 
388.
9  
 26 
  
 
 
  
   
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
In contrast, HFCR Rule 52(a) specifically allows a family 
court “to order the parties or either of them to submit proposed 
findings of fact and conclusions of law[.]”  In addition, there 
are no Hawaiʻi appellate cases prohibiting a trial court from 
adopting findings of fact and conclusions of law submitted by 
counsel, as long as they are not clearly erroneous or wrong.  
For example, in Molokoa Village Development Co., v. Kauai Elec. 
Co., 60 Haw. 582, 593 P.2d 375 (1979), we stated that, “although with only a few exceptions the trial court adopted findings of fact prepared by counsel for Molokoa, the findings must stand if 
not clearly erroneous.” 60 Haw. at 592, 593 P.2d at 382.
10 
Based on the high volume of cases heard in our family 
courts, it is unrealistic for our family court judges to prepare their own findings of fact and conclusions of law in every case. 
Although it would be preferable for the record to show that the family court reviewed proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law before adopting them verbatim, our law does not prohibit 
wholesale adoption of proposed findings of fact and conclusions 
of law as long as they are not clearly erroneous or wrong as a 
 10   In Molokoa , we cited to Wright and Miller, Federal Practice and 
Procedure,  Civil § 2578 (1971), governing “Preparation of Findings” under   
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (“FRCP”) Rule 52 (2009).   FRCP Rule 52 also
does not have a provision specifically allowing a court to request that the 
parties submit proposed findings.    
 27 
    
 
 
 In the second question on certiorari, DL argues the ICA 
erred in affirming the family court’s denial of DL’s motion to  
disqualify CL’s counsel and law firm.     
 HRPC Rule 1.10(c), Imputation of Conflicts of Interest,
generally states:  
 When a lawyer becomes associated with a firm, and the
lawyer is prohibited from representing a client because the
lawyer’s former firm has represented a person whose
interests are materially adverse to that client in the same
or a substantially related matter, other lawyers in thefirm may not thereafter represent the client unless:  
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
matter of law. In addition, there is no basis for DL’s 
assertion that the family court did not read the submissions 
within the three days that elapsed between their submission and
adoption; counsel should not make unfounded assertions.    
Therefore, DL’s assertion that the 4/26/18 FOFs/COLS should
be rejected because the family court adopted CL’s submissions 
lacks merit.   
B. The ICA did not err in affirming the family court’s 
denial of DL’s motion to disqualify CL’s counsel and law 
firm 
 
 
(1) the disqualified lawyer did not participate in
the matter and has no confidential information regarding
the matter;
(2) the disqualified lawyer is timely screened from
any participation in the matter and is apportioned no par
t 
of the fee therefrom; and
(3) written notice is promptly given to any affected
former client to enable it to ascertain compliance with the
provisions of this Rule. 
Comment 4 to HRPC Rule 1.10 states, however, that HRPC Rule 1.10 
does “not necessarily prohibit representation by others in the   
 28 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
law firm where the person prohibited from involvement in a 
matter is a nonlawyer[.]” Instead, such nonlawyers “may be 
screened where effective from any personal participation in the 
matter to avoid communication to others in the firm of confidential information that both the nonlawyer and the firm have a legal duty to protect.” HRPC Rule 1.10 cmt. 4. 
DL’s motion to disqualify involved a paralegal and not an 
attorney.  Even if the paralegal had been exposed to and had the opportunity to acquire confidential information during 
employment at DL’s prior law firm, pursuant to HRPC Rule 1.10 
Comment 4, CL’s law firm would not necessarily be prohibited from representing CL if an effective screen had been put in place.
11 
According to evidence the family court found credible, CL’s 
law firm was aware of the conflict at the time of the paralegal’s hiring and had put in place procedures that provided 
effective screening “from any personal participation in the 
matter to avoid communication to others in the firm of confidential information that both the nonlawyer and the firm have a legal duty to protect.” See HRPC Rule 1.0(l).  
 11  “Screened” is further defined by HRPC Rule 1.0(l)  (2014) to mean   ,  “the 
isolation of a lawyer from any participation in a matter through the timely
imposition of procedures within a firm that  are reasonably adequate under the
circumstances to protect the information that the isolated lawyer isobligated to protect under these Rules or other law.”   
 29 
  
  
 
 
 
 
   
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Accordingly, the ICA did not err in ruling the family court did 
not abuse its discretion, i.e., disregard rules or principles of 
law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party 
litigant, when it denied DL’s motion to disqualify. C. The ICA did not err in affirming the family court’s order
awarding to CL sole physical custody of the parties’
children and allowing CL to relocate the children to Arizona 
With respect to DL’s third and last question on certiorari, 
as indicated in Section II.C above, the ICA carefully reviewed the family court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding custody and relocation, which were supported by substantial evidence.  For the reasons stated by the ICA, the 
family court did not err in awarding sole physical custody of 
the children to CL and allowing CL to relocate with the children to Arizona. Therefore, this question on certiorari lacks merit. 
V. Conclusion 
For the reasons explained above, we therefore affirm the 
ICA’s May 3, 2019 judgment affirming the family court’s (1) April 26, 2018 Amended Findings of fact, Conclusions of Law and 
Order Regarding: June 21, 2017 Order Re: Defendant’s Motion 
for Pre-Decree Relief; March 13, 2016 Order Re:  Evidentiary Hearing; and March 16, 2018 First Amended Order Re: Evidentiary 
Hearing, and (4/26/18 FOFs/COLs re child custody); and (2) the 
April 23, 2018 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and order
