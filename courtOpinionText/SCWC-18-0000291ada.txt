  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
OPINION  OF THE COURT BY GINOZA, J.  
This appeal arises from claims asserted by 
Petitioner/Plaintiff -Appellant Thomas F. Schmidt ( Schmidt) 
against his former attorney, Respondents/Defendants -Appellees 
Gary V. Dubin and the Dubin Law Offices (collectively, Dubin). 
Schmidt brought suit in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit 
(Circuit Court )1 alleging Dubin breached contractual and other 
duties to represent Schmidt in a separate lawsuit ( Ruthruff 
Lawsuit) and improperly kept a $100,000 retainer that Schmidt 
claims he paid to Dubin for future legal work in the Ruthruff 
Lawsuit. 
The Circuit Court entered two orders granting partial 
summary judgment for Dubin and also awarded Dubin attorneys’ 
fees and costs as the prevailing party. The award for 
attorneys’ fees was based on Hawai‘i Revised Statutes ( HRS) 
§ 607-14 (2016). The award for costs was based on HRS § 607 -9 
(2016) and Hawai‘i Rules of Civil Procedure ( HRCP) Rule 54(d)(1) 
(eff. 2000) . The Circuit Court entered judgment in favor of 
Dubin and against Schmidt, including on the attorneys’ fees and 
costs. 
1 The Honorable Karl K. Sakamoto presided from March 17, 2015, 
until the case was reassigned on January 5, 2017 to the Honorable Bert I. 
Ayabe.

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Schmidt appealed to the Intermediate Court of Appeal s 
(ICA), challeng ing the Circuit Court’s first summary judgment 
ruling, regarding his claim that Dubin improperly kept $100,000 
and breached contractual duties . The ICA held that summary 
judgment on these claims w as improper , vacated the Circuit 
Court’s judgment as to these claims, but affirmed the judgment 
in all other respects. Schmidt filed a motion for 
reconsideration, asserting the ICA should also vacate the 
attorneys’ fees and costs award, which the ICA denied. 
Schmidt’s application for certiorari to this court 
contends the ICA erred in affirming the portion of the Circuit 
Court’s judgment that awarded attorneys’ fees and costs to 
Dubin, and in denying Schmidt’s motion for reconsideration on 
this issue . Schmidt argues the ICA erred because , although it 
vacated summary judgment for Dubin on Schmidt ’s breach of 
contract claims, the ICA simultaneously affirmed the award of 
attorneys’ fees and costs when Dubin was no longer the 
prevailing party on the breach of con tract claims for purposes 
of HRS §§ 607 -14 and 607 -9 and HRCP Rule 54(d)(1). 
We hold that after vacating the judgment on the breach 
of contract claims , the ICA erred by affirming the judgment “in 
all other respects,” which included judgment in favor of Dubin 
3  
 
 
   Given  the allegations in Schmidt’s  complaint, Dubin 
filed two motions for partial summary judgment: one on all 
claims based on the alleged $100,000 debt, including Schmidt’s 
breach of contract claims  (MPSJ  #1); and one related to claims 
based on HRS  Chapter 480 and the Hawai ‘i  Rules of Professional 
Conduct (MPSJ #2).

  I. Background for attorneys’ fees and costs as the prevailing party. See  
Ass’n of Owners of Kalele Kai v.
  Yoshikawa, 149 Hawai‘i 417, 418, 
493 P.3d 939, 940 (2021) (“[W]hen a judgment upon which 
attorneys’  fees and costs were based has been vacated, 
attorneys’  fees and costs arising out of that judgment should 
also be vacated[.]”).   We further hold that the ICA erred by 
denying Schmidt’s motion for reconsideration, which expressly 
asserted that the attorneys’  fees  and costs  order should be 
vacated.  
The Circuit Court granted partial summary judgment in 
favor of Dubin on MPSJ #1, concluding that Schmidt’s claims 
based on the alleged debt were time -barred by HRS § 657-1(1) 
(2016) ( MPSJ Order #1). The Circuit Court also separately 
granted partial summary judgment in favor of Dubin on MPSJ #2 
(MPSJ Order #2 ).2 
2 MPSJ Order #2 was not based on statute of limitations grounds.

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Subsequently, pursuant to HRS §§ 607 -14 and 607 -9, and 
HRCP Rule 54(d)(1), the Circuit Court awarded $25,000 for 
attorneys’ fees (25% of the $100,000 sought in the Complaint) 
and $1,468.88  for costs to Dubin as the prevailing party, for a 
total amount of $ 26,468.88  (Fees/Costs Order). 
On April 2, 2018, Schmidt filed a Notice of Appeal in 
the ICA, stating he sought review of the MPSJ Order #1 and the 
Fees/Costs Order. At the time Schmidt appealed, the Circuit 
Court had not entered a final appealable judgment. The ICA 
temporarily remanded the case to the Circuit Court for entry of 
a final appealable judgment, which was entered on November 8, 
2018, and which included judgment against Schmidt and in favor 
of Dubin in the amount of $ 26,468.88  for attorneys’ fees and 
costs (Final Judgment ). 
In his opening brief to the ICA, Schmidt argued the 
Circuit Court erred in granting MPSJ Order #1 and improperly 
dealt with statute of limitations issues. Schmidt requested 
that MPSJ Order #1 be vacated , the case be remanded with 
instructions related to the statute of limitations , and for 
further consistent proceedings . Schmidt did not argue the award 
of attorneys’ fees and costs should also be vacated. 
On March 28, 2024 , the ICA issued a Summary 
Disposition Order ( SDO) concluding the Circuit Court erred in 
holding that Schmidt’s breach of contract claims against Dubin 
5  
 
 
     
  
 
  
     
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
were time-barred because genuine issues of material fact exist 
as to when  an alleged breach of contract action accrued. 
Schmidt v. Dubin, No. CAAP-18-0000291, 2024 WL 1329361 (Haw. App. Mar. 28, 2024) (SDO). The SDO concluded by stating:  
For these reasons, the Circuit Court ’s November 8, 2018 
Judgment is affirmed in part and vacated in part. The 
Judgment is vacated with respect to the Circuit Court ’s 
granting of summary judgment on Schmidt ’s breach of 
contract claim(s) against Dubin on the grounds that they were time -barred. The Judgment is affirmed in all other 
respects.   This case is remanded to the Circuit Court for 
further proceedings consistent with this Summary Disposition Order.  
Id. at *3 (emphasis added) . 
On March 28, 2024, Schmidt timely filed a motion for 
reconsideration requesting that the ICA reconsider the portion 
of its SDO affirming the Circuit Court’s judgment “in all other 
respects.” Schmidt argued that the Fees/Costs Order should be 
vacated because the ICA vacated MPSJ Order #1 and Dubin is not 
the prevailing party on the assumpsit (breach of contract) 
claims. The ICA denied Schmidt’s motion for reconsideration. 
The ICA then entered its Judgment on Appeal stating 
that the Circuit Court’s Final Judgment is “affirmed in part and 
vacated in part” and “[t]his case is remanded to the Circuit 
Court for further proceedings consistent with the Summary 
Disposition Order .” (Emphasis added.) 
II. Discussion 
The Circuit Court’s Fees/Costs Order and Final 
Judgment awarded attorneys’ fees and costs to Dubin in the 
6  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
   
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
amount of $ 26,468.88 , based on Dubin being the prevailing party . 
The Circuit Court’s Fees/Costs Order provided that the fees and 
costs were awarded to Dubin pursuant to HRS §§ 607 -14 and 607 -9, 
and HRCP Rule 54(d)(1). The Final Judgment, entering judgment 
of $26,468.88  against Schmidt and in favor of Dubin, provided 
that it was based inter alia on: MPSJ Order #1, MPSJ Order #2, 
and the Fees/Costs Order. 
  HRS § 607-14 provides, in relevant part, that for all 
actions in the nature of assumpsit, “there shall be taxed as 
attorneys’ fees, to be paid by the losing party  . . . a fee that 
the court determines to be reasonable[.]” (Emphasis added);   
see  Deutsche Bank Nat’l Tr. Co. v. Kozma, 140 Hawaiʻi  494, 498, 
403 P.3d 271, 275 (2017) (“A prevailing party is entitled to 
attorney’s fees pursuant to HRS § 607-14[.]”).  
Regarding the amount of attorneys’ fees to be awarded 
under HRS § 607 -14, the statute states: “The above fees provided 
for by this section shall be assessed on the amount of the 
judgment exclusive of costs and all attorneys ’ fees obtained by 
the plaintiff, and upon the amount sued for if the defendant 
obtains judgment .” (Emphasis added) ; see also Stanford Carr 
Dev. Corp. v. Unity House, Inc. , 111 Hawaiʻi 286, 307, 141 P.3d 
459, 480 (2006) (holding that attorneys’ fees awarded in the 
amount of $ 707,309.98  was within the statutory limits of HRS § 
607-14, where the losing party had sought damages of over $7 
7  
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
  
  
 
    
    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
million and thus the prevailing party was entitled to no more 
than twenty -five percent of that amount). 
Here, Dubin was defending against Schmidt’s breach of 
contract claims and prevailed in the Circuit Court. Schmidt’s 
Complaint asserted he was entitled to recover a $100,000 
retainer he had paid to Dubin. After the Circuit Court granted 
summary judgment for Dub in on Schmidt’s contract claims, the 
Circuit Court awarded Dubin attorneys’ fees in the amount of 
$25,000 ($100,000 x .25) under HRS § 607 -14. 
As for costs, the Circuit Court awarded Dubin 
$1,468.88  “incurred by [Dubin’s] counsel in defense of this 
action[.]” (Emphasis added.) HRS § 607 -9 sets out the types of 
costs that can be awarded. HRCP Rule 54(d)(1) provides in 
relevant part that: “Except when express provision therefor is 
made either in a statute or in these rules, costs shall be 
allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court 
otherwise directs [.]” (Emphasis added.) 
Given the statutory and rule authority relied upon by 
the Circuit Court, its award of attorneys’ fees and costs to 
Dubin was grounded on Dubin being the prevailing party. Once 
the ICA vacated the Circuit Court ’s MPSJ Order #1, which 
addressed Schmidt’s breach of contract claims, Dubin was no 
longer the prevailing party as to the assumpsit claim s and no 
longer entitled to attorneys’ fees under HRS § 607 -14. 
8  
 
 
   It appears  the costs  awarded by the Circuit Court were 
based on Dubin prevailing in MPSJ Order  #1  (as to the breach of 
contract claims) as well as  MPSJ Order #2  (as to the HRS Chapter 
480 and malpractice claims). To the extent the Circuit Court 
awarded costs to Dubin as the prevailing party on MPSJ Order  #1, 
that basis no longer existed once the ICA vacated MPSJ Order  #1. 
However, to the extent the costs award was based on  MPSJ Order 
#2, that basis remained because Schmidt did not appeal that part 
of the Circuit Court’s rulings.   3
  
 
   
  
 
  In Yoshikawa, this court held that “when a judgment 
upon which attorneys’  fees and costs were based has been 
vacated, attorneys’  fees and costs arising out of that judgment 
should also be vacated[.]” 149 Hawai‘i at 418, 493 P.3d at 940. 
Yoshikawa  applies here. In that case, the ICA “vacated the 
summary judgment but affirmed the related attorneys’ fees and 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Given these circumstances , after vacating MPSJ Order 
#1 on Schmidt’s breach of contract claims, the ICA erred by then 
stating in the SDO that the Circuit Court ’s Final Judgment “is 
affirmed in all other respects .” The ICA affirmed the Final 
Judgment on the attorneys’ fees and costs award to Dubin when it 
had just vacated the primary grounds on which Dubin had been the 
prevailing party in the Circuit Court. 
3 On remand, although we vacate the Fees/Costs Order, the Circuit 
Court may consider among other things, its costs award based on its MPSJ 
Order #2. 
9  
 
 
  
   
  
  
 
  
 
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
costs awards because [the appellant,] Yoshikawa[,] had not 
specifically addressed them in his appellate briefs.” 149 
Hawai‘i at 418, 493 P.3d at 940.  This court vacated the ICA’s 
judgment on appeal to the extent it affirmed the circuit court’s 
grant of attorneys’ fees and costs which arose from the vacated 
summary judgment. Id. 
Here, like in Yoshikawa , Schmidt did not directly 
challenge the award of attorneys’ fees and costs to Dubin in his 
briefing to the ICA. However, he challenged the primary 
underlying basis that had made Dubin the prevailing party in the 
Circuit Court for purposes of the fees and costs award. The ICA 
vacated the Final Judgment to the extent summary judgment was 
granted for Dubin on the breach of contract claims, but then 
affirmed the Circuit Court ’s judgment “in all other respects,” 
which effectively affi rmed the attorneys’ fees and costs award 
to Dubin. 
Moreover, on the same day the SDO was filed, Schmidt 
filed a motion for reconsideration with the ICA , pointing out 
the inconsistent result due to the SDO language affirming the 
Final Judgment “in all other respects.” Schmidt asserted the 
attorneys’ fees and costs awarded to Dubin should also be 
vacated because the ICA vacated MPSJ Order #1 and Dubin was no 
longer the prevailing party. The ICA denied the motion for 
reconsideration, which is a further signal to the Circuit Court 
10  
 
 
    
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
     
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
on remand that the ICA intended to affirm the award of 
attorneys’ fees and costs to Dubin.4 
Then, in the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal, it stated that 
the Circuit Court’s Final Judgment was “ affirmed in part and 
vacated in part[,]” and that the case was “remanded to the 
Circuit Court for further proceedings consistent with the 
Summary Disposition Order.” The ICA’s Judgment on Appeal does 
not contain the same language affirming the Circuit Court’s 
Final Judgm ent “in all other respects,” but it does indicate 
that the Final Judgment is “affirmed in part” and then requires 
on remand that the Circuit Cou rt’s further proceedings be 
consistent with the SDO. 
We conclude the ICA’s SDO and Judgment on Appeal are 
inconsistent with Yoshikawa and would improperly preclude the 
Circuit Court from further addressing the $ 26,468.88  fees and 
costs award to Dubin. It is well established that on remand, 
circuit courts are required “to comply strictly with the mandate 
of the appellate court according to its true intent and meaning, 
as determined by the directions given by the reviewing court [.]” 
4 The denial of the reconsideration motion undercuts the Dissent ’s 
suggestion that the Circuit Court would feel free to vacate the award of 
attorneys ’ fees and costs . On remand, Dubin w ould undoubtedly argue that the 
ICA considered and precluded that very course of action when it denied the 
reconsideration motion. The ICA’s rulings as a whole, including its denial 
of the reconsideration motion, clearly indicate it affirmed the fees and 
costs award.

Chun v. Bd. of Trs. of Emp.s’  Ret. Sys. of State of Hawai‘i, 106 
Hawai‘i  416, 439, 106 P.3d 339, 362 (2005) (citation omitted); 
see also  In re Hawai ‘i  Elec. Light Co., 149 Hawai‘ i 239, 241, 487 
P.3d 708, 710 (2021).  
Here, given the language of the ICA’s SDO, the ICA’s 
denial of Schmidt’s motion for reconsideration, and its Judgment 
on Appeal, the Circuit Court would be required “to comply 
strictly with the mandate” of the ICA on remand, which indicates 
that the attorneys’ fees and costs award to Dubin was affirmed 
by the ICA. See Chun, 106 Hawai‘i at 439, 106 P.3d at 362. This 
result would be inconsistent with the ICA’s vacating of MPSJ 
Order #1, and contrary to Yoshikawa . 
III. Conclusion 
Based on the foregoing , we vacate in part the ICA’s 
Judgment on Appeal to the extent it affirmed the Circuit Court’s 
Final Judgment awarding $ 26,468.88  in attorneys’ fees and costs 
to Dubin. We also vacate the Circuit Court’s Final Judgment to 
the extent it awarded Dubin the $ 26,468.88  in attorneys’ fees 
and costs ; and the Circuit Court’s Fees/Costs Order .
