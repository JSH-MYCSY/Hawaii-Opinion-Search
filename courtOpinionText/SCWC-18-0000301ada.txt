OPINION OF THE COURT BY, McKENNA, J.    
 
I. Introduction 
 This case concerns whether the Intermediate Court of 
Appeals (“ICA”) abused its discretion by (1) sanctioning 
attorneys Robert Patrick McPherson (“McPherson”) and Earl A. 
Partington (“Partington”) ( sometimes collectively referred to as 
“Counsel”) each in the amount of $50.00 based on Hawai ʻi Rules of Electronically Filed
Supreme Court

 Appellate Procedure (“HRAP”) Rule 51 (2010) (“sanctions orders”) 
and by denying Counsel’s motion to reconsider the sanctions 
orders; and (2) whether the Office of Disciplinary Counsel 
(“ODC”) 
was authorized to thereafter send letters to Counsel 
indicating it was administratively disposing of the matter  and 
that the sanctions orders could be used as evidence of 
aggravation in any future disciplinary proceedings.   
As explained below, we hold (1) that the ICA did not abuse 
its discretion by imposing sanctions on Counsel and denying the 
motion for reconsideration; (2) but that the ODC  was without 
authority to treat the sanctions orders as administrative 
dispositions that might be used in the future as evidence of a 
pattern of conduct in aggravation.   
We therefore affirm the ICA’s sanctions orders against  
Counsel, but also order that the clerk of the court transmit 
this opinion to the ODC for appropriate action consistent with 
this opinion.    
II. Background 
A. District court proceedings and notice of appeal 
 
On July 17, 2017, the State of Hawai ʻi (“State”) charged 
Maggie Kwong (“Kwong”)  via a complaint with “operating a vehicle 
under the influence of an intoxicant” (“O VUII”) in violation of 
Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (“ HRS”) § 291E-61(a)(1) (Supp. 2014).  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 After a jury- waived bench trial on March 14,  2018,1 the District 
Court of the First Circuit (“ district court”) found Kwong guilty 
as charged and sentenced Kwong to pay a fine and various fees, 
as well as to attend a substance abuse program.   Upon 
McPherson’s request , the district  court delayed sentencing with 
respect to Kwong’s  license revocation until  April 13, 2018.  
 On March 14, 2018 the district court entered a judgment of 
guilt and Kwong’s partial sentence.  On its face, the judgment 
indicated that further sentencing on “LR ,” which appears to be 
shorthand for “License Revocation,” would take place on April 
13, 2018.2  Before that date, however, on April 3, 2018, a notice 
of appeal was filed by McPherson and Pedric Arrisgado 
(“Arrisgado”).  At the April 13, 2018
 sentencing hearing,  
Arrisgado informed the district court of Kwong’s appeal.   The 
district court did not proceed to sentencing with respect to the 
license revocation and stayed Kwong’s previously imposed partial 
sentence pending appeal.  
 On May 29, 2018, the ICA filed a notice indicating Kwong’s 
jurisdictional statement was due on June 8, 2018 and that her  
opening brief was due on July 9, 2018.   On June 8, 2018, 
                     
1  The Honorable William M. Domingo presided.  
 
2  The district court used the standard “Notice of Entry of Judgment 
and/or Order and Plea/Judgment” form, which is also used for final judgments.  
This could create confusion as to whether a judgment is partial or final.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 Partington entered an appearance for Kwong and filed a 
jurisdictional statement asserting  the ICA had appellate 
jurisdiction over Kwong’s appeal.  On April 12, 2018, McPherson 
had filed a request for transcripts, and various transcripts 
were filed on June 12, 2018. 
Counsel did not, however,  file an opening brief  on July 9, 
2018.  Instead, two days later, on July 11, 2018, Counsel 
submitted an amended statement of jurisdiction pointing out that 
appellate jurisdiction was lacking because sentencing had not 
been completed.3  Counsel’s amended statement of jurisdiction 
stated in relevant part:   
The Judgment filed below in the District Court of the First 
Circuit on March 14, 2018 . . . 
is not a final judgment.  
Sentencing was not completed on March 14, 2018, as final 
sentencing on Defendant’s license revocation was not held 
until April 13, 2018, ten days after  the notice of appeal 
was filed[.]  No final judgment has ever been filed.  
Defendant’s Notice of Appeal was timely filed pursuant to 
Rule 4(b)(1) of the Hawai[‘]i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
on April 3, 2018[.] 
 
. . . .  
 
The Judgment below did not dispose of all the claims 
against all the parties as sentencing was not complete.    
 
. . . .  
 
                     
3  HRS § 641- 12(a) (2016) provides:  
 
(a) Appeals upon the record shall be allowed from all final 
decisions and final judgments of district courts in all 
criminal matters.  Such appeals may be made to the 
intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 602, 
whenever the party appealing shall file notice of the 
party’s appeal within thirty days, or such other time as 
may be provided by the rules of the court.  
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
5 . . . . 
 Further sentencing as to Defendant’s license revocation did 
not take place until April 13, 2018.  The sentence has been 
stayed pending appeal . . . . This case must be remanded to 
the district court for entry of a final judgment.  
(Emphasis added.)  Thus, Counsel alerted the ICA to the lack of 
appellate jurisdiction 
and stated that the case must be remanded 
to the district court for entry of a final judgment.  
B. Order to show cause , Counsel’s response, and order for 
sanctions  
 Six days later, o n July 17, 2018, the ICA clerk’s offic e 
sent a memorandum to Counsel, which stated: 
We docketed the record on appeal in the above -entitled case 
on 29-May-2018.  The time for filing the appellant’ s 
opening brief expired on 09 -Jul-2018.  
 
This is to inform you that the matter will be called to the 
attention of the Court on 27 -Jul-2018 for such action as 
the court deems proper, and the appeal may be dismissed. 
See 
Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 30.[4]  
 
Any request for relief from this default should be made by 
motion.  See HRAP Rules 26 and 27.  
 
Counsel did not file anything in direct response to the July 17, 
2018 memorandum from the ICA.   
                     
4  HRAP Rule 30 (2015) provides in relevant part:  
When the brief for appellant is not filed within the time 
required, the  appellate clerk shall forthwith give notice 
to the parties that the matter will be called to the 
attention of the  appellate court on a day certain for such 
action as the  appellate court deems proper and that the 
appeal may be dismissed.   When the brief of an appellant is 
otherwise not in conformity with these Rules, the appeal 
may be dismissed or the brief stricken and monetary or 
other sanctions may be levied by the  appellate court  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
6 
 Almost six months later, on January 7, 2019 , the ICA filed 
an order to show cause directed at Counsel, which stated as 
follows: 
(1)  On April 3, 2018, [Kwong] filed the notice of appeal, 
through [McPherson];  
(2) On May 29, 2018, the district court clerk filed the 
record on appeal, and the appellate clerk notified Kwong, 
through McPherson, that, among other things, the opening 
brief was due on or before July 9, 2018;  
(3) On June 8, 2018, [Partington]  entered an appearance 
for Kwong;  
(4)  Kwong failed to file the opening brief, or request an 
extension of time;  
(5)  On July 17, 2018, the appellate clerk notified Kwong, 
through McPherson and Partington,[5] that the time
 for filing 
the opening brief had expired, the matter would be called 
to the court’s attention on July 27, 2018, for appropriate 
action, which could include dismissal of the appeal, 
pursuant to Hawai ʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 30, 
and Kwong may request relief from default by motion; and  
(6)  Kwong took no further action in this appeal.  
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that  within ten (10) days 
from the date of this order, [McPherson] and [Partington] 
each shall show cause, jointly or separately, in the form 
of a declaration, affidavit, or other sworn statement, 
indicating why they failed to file the opening brief, or 
request an extension of time.  Failure to timely res pond to 
this order or to show good cause may result in sanctions.  
  
 Counsel  timely responded to the order to show cause on 
January 17, 2019 as follows:   
In State v. Kilborn, 109 Haw. 435, 442, 127 P.3d 95, 102 
(App.2005), this court held that  
 
Judgments of conviction entered in district 
courts may not be appealed unless they are 
final.  Judgments of conviction are not final 
unless they include the final adjudication and 
the final sentence.  In the instant case, the 
sentence imposed was not the final sentence 
                     
5 The notice of default was also addressed to Arrisgado, who had also 
appeared as an attorney for Kwong in the notice of appeal.  The ICA did not, 
however, include Arrisgado in the later order to show cause or impose 
sanctions on Arrisgado.  
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
7 
 (continued. . .)  because the district court expressly left often 
the possibility that its sentenc
e of Kilborn 
might include an order requiring Kilborn to pay 
restitution.  The court did not finally decide 
whether it would order Kilborn to pay 
restitution and, if so, in what amount. 
Consequently, the December 5, 2003 Judgment is 
not final and, because it is not final, it is 
not appealable.  
 
On July 11, 2018, Kwong filed an Amended Statement of 
Jurisdiction noting that no judgment as required by Kilborn  
has ever been filed in this case.  Therefore, Kwong’s 
attorneys have been waiting for this court to dismiss this 
appeal and remand this case to the district court for entry 
of a judgment.  Her attorneys were not aware that any more 
was needed to be done than that.  The filing of any brief 
would have been a meaningless act . 
 
On February 13, 2019, the ICA entered a sanctions  order, 
ruling that Counsel ’s January 17, 2019 response to the January 
7, 2019 order to show cause failed to demonstrate good cause for 
their failure to file an opening brief or request an extension 
of time.  The ICA noted that the amended statement of 
jurisdiction filed after the “default on  the opening brief ” was 
not a motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of appellate 
jurisdiction.  The ICA pointed out that it was not until Counsel 
were ordered to show cause that Counsel 
represented Kwong’s  
appeal should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  The ICA  
then ordered as follows:  
(1) Pursuant to Hawai ʻi 
Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 
51,[6] Earle A. Partington  and R. Patrick McPherson are 
sanctioned in the amount of $50.00 each.  
                     
6  HRAP Rule 51 provides in relevant part:  
Any attorney of record or party in a case, who fails to 
comply with any  of the provisions of the Hawai ʻi Rules 
of Appellate  Procedure . . . or any order of the court ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
8 
 (2) Separate checks in the full amount, payable to the 
State Director of Finance, along with a copy of this order, 
shall be deposited with the Supreme Court Clerk’ s Office 
within ten days from the date of this order.  
(3) A declaration of Counsel, jointly or separately, 
attesting to the payment shall be filed within ten days 
from the date of this order.  
(4) The sanction shall be paid by Counsel personally and 
without reimbursement.  
(5) Failure to comply with this order may result in 
additional sanctions.  
 Then, o n February 22, 2019, the ICA entered an order 
dismissing Kwong’s appeal for l ack of appellate jurisdiction, 
because the judgment “on its fac e” indicated Kwong’s  sentencing 
was incomplete.  The ICA noted that because the notice of appeal 
was jurisdictionally defective, filing the notice had not 
transferred jurisdiction from the trial court to the appellate 
court, quoting State v. Ontiveros
, 82 Hawai ʻi 446, 449, 92
3 P.2d 
388, 391 (1996).   
C. Motion for reconsideration  
 On February 22, 2019, Counsel f iled a motion for 
reconsideration of the sanctions order.   Counsel asserted the 
ICA incorrectly stated that Counsel had not represented to the 
ICA that the appeal should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction 
until their January 17, 2019 response to the order to show 
cause.  Counsel contended their July 11, 2018 amended statement 
                                                                  
(. . . continued) 
shall be subject to monetary or other sanctions by 
the appellate  court before which such case is pending, such 
sanctions to be levied by order of the  appellate court or 
by order of any judge or justice thereof.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
9 
 of jurisdiction had set forth  the lack of appellate 
jurisdiction, and that they “are aware of no rule requiring them 
to timely inform this court of the lack of jurisdiction more 
than once.”  
 The ICA denied the motion for reconsideration on February 
28, 2019.7  The ICA noted that the amended statement of 
jurisdiction did not request the appeal be dismissed, but rather 
stated the ICA must remand the case for entry of a final 
judgment, which was a different remedy than dismissal for lack 
of jurisdiction.  The ICA also noted that the amended statement 
of jurisdiction had been 
filed after the default of the opening 
brief. 
 After the denial of the motion for reconsideration, o n 
February 28, 2019
 and March 1, 2019 , McPherson and Partington 
each paid their $50.00 sanction s.  
D. Application for writ of certiorari 
 On March 6, 2019, Counsel timely filed an application for 
writ of certiorari posing one question:  
Whether the ICA gravely erred in sanctioning Counsel and 
refusing reconsideration for C ounsel’s failure to request 
dismissal in Kwong’s amended statement of jurisdiction 
                     
7  The ICA construed the motion for reconsideration as a motion by 
Partington on his behalf alone, and not also for McPherson, because  
Partington electronically signed  the motion for reconsideration alone, as 
attorney for Kwong.  As the motion for reconsideration also listed McPherson, 
and, in any event, McPherson was not required to file a motion fo r 
reconsideration in order to be included in the certiorari application, we do 
not further address this issue.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
10 
 wherein Kwong  repeatedly informed the ICA that there was no 
judgment below and asked that the case be remanded to the 
district court for entry of judgment which the [ICA] 
refused to do [.]  
 
(Capitalization altered.) 
E. Letters from the Office of Disciplinary Counsel 
 On March 21 , 2019, Counsel filed a supplemental memorandum  
in support of their application attaching letters dated March 
14, 2019 they had received from ODC.  The letters are discussed 
in Section IV.B, infra. 
III.  Standard s of Review 
A. Order for sanctions  
 Sanctions imposed under statute, court rule, or the trial 
court’s inherent powers are reviewed for an abuse of discretion.  
Gap v. Puna Geothermal Venture , 106 Hawai i 325, 331, 104 P.3d 
912, 918 (2004).  The trial court abuses its discretion if it 
bases its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly 
erroneous assessment of the evidence.  Id.  
B. Motion for reconsideration  
 A court ’s ruling on a motion for reconsideration is also 
reviewed for an abuse of discretion.  State v. Oughterson, 99 
Hawaiʻi 244, 253,
 54 P.3d 415, 424 (2002). 
 
 
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
11 
 C. Questions of law 
 Questions  of law are reviewable de novo under the 
right/wrong standard of review.  State v. Baranco,  77 Hawai ʻi 
351, 355, 884 P.2d 729, 733 (1994) .  
IV.  Discussion 
A. The ICA did not abuse its discretion by imposing sanctions 
pursuant to HRAP Rule 51 and denying the motion for 
reconsideration 
 
1. Contrary to Counsel’s assertion, Joshua is 
inapplicable 
 
On certiorari, Counsel maintain  that although they did not 
expressly ask for dismissal of the appeal, they  “did exactly 
what this court said they should do [in State ex rel. Office of 
Consumer Protection v. Joshua , 141 Hawai ʻi 91, 405 P.3d 527 
(2017)] – move to remand this case to district court for the 
entry of a judgment .”  Counsel cite to State v. Nicol , 140 
Hawaiʻi 482, 488, 403 P.3d 259, 265 (2017), for the proposi tion 
that “[t]he rule of finality for jurisdiction to appeal is the 
same in criminal case [s].”  Counsel contend th is court  should 
therefore reverse the ICA’s order for sanctions and order the 
State Director of Finance to refund Counsel’s  sanction payments.   
We reject Counsel’s contention that the ICA should have 
remanded the case to the district court for an entry of final 
judgment based on Joshua .   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
12 
 In Joshua, we prospectively held that when a party to a 
circuit court civil ca se timely appeals a purported final 
judgment later determined not to meet  finality  requirements set 
out in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai ʻi 115, 
119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994)  (per curiam) , “rather than 
dismiss the appeal, the ICA must temporarily remand  the case to 
the circuit court ‘in aid of its jurisdiction’  pursuant to  
HRS § 602-57(3) (2016)  for entry of an appealable final judgment 
with a direction to the circuit court to supplement the record 
on appeal with the final judgment. ”  Joshua, 141 Hawai ʻi at 93, 
405 P.3d 529.   
By its clear language, Joshua  only applies to purported 
“final judgments” in circuit court civil cases, which are so 
titled and intended by circuit court judges, but f ail to meet 
Jenkins finality requirements.  Its holding does not apply to 
any other kind of judgment, especially not to judg ments that 
were never intended to be “final judgments .”  Thus, Counsel’s 
argument that they “did exactly what this court said they should 
do – move to remand this case to district court for the entry of 
a judgment,” is devoid of  merit.8   
                     
8  In addition, Counsel never “moved” the ICA to remand the case to the 
district court for entry of final judgment  as represented; if Counsel  had 
clearly done so, the ICA could have denied the motion at the time.  
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
13 
 In addition, to the extent Counsel may be suggesting that, 
through this case, we expand the Joshua requirement of a remand 
for entry of final judgment to district court criminal 
judgments, we decline to do so for the following reasons.  
First, a remand for entry of final judgment under the 
circumstances of this case 
would contravene HRAP Rule 4(b)(4) 
(2020), which governs “Premature Notice[s] of Appeal” in 
criminal cases, and provides:  
(b)   Appeals in criminal cases.  
. . . . 
(4)  Premature Notice of Appeal .  A notice of appeal filed 
after the announcement of a  decision, sentenc e or order but 
before entry of the judgment  or order shall be deemed to 
have been filed on the date such judgment  or order is 
entered. 
  
(Emphasis added.)  Applying this rule, the April 9, 2018 
premature notice of appeal 
in this case could not have been 
deemed to have been filed on a later date because the sentence 
on license revocation had not been “announced” as of the April 
9, 2018 filing of the notice of appeal.  Thus, pursuant to HRAP 
Rule 4(b)(4), the ICA would not have been able to “‘aid . . . 
its jurisdiction’ pursuant to  HRS § 602- 57(3) (2016)” because it 
would not have been able to ac quire appellate jurisdiction even 
if it had ordered a remand.   Joshua, 141 Hawai ʻi at 93, 405 P.3d ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
14 
 at 529.  In order for appellate jurisdiction to exist, a new 
notice of appeal would have been required.9   
 In comparison, Joshua did not implicate  concerns under HRAP 
Rule 4(a)(2), which governs “Premature filing of appeal[s]” in 
civil cases, and provides as follows:  
If a notice of appeal is filed after announcement of a 
decision but before entry of the judgment or order, such 
notice shall be considered as filed immediately after the 
time the judgment or order becomes  final for the purpose of 
appeal. 
 
In other words, in the circuit court civil cases for which 
Joshua requires remand for 
entry of Jenkins-compliant final 
judgments, not only have “decision [s]” been “announce[d],” the 
circuit courts have already entered purported “ final judgments ” 
termed as such.  Thus, not only is Joshua consistent with HRAP 
Rule 4(a)(2), it does not impose a significant administrative 
burden on the ICA.10 
                     
9  We note that, as stated by the ICA in its sanctions orders,  Kwong’s 
premature notice of appeal did not deprive the  district court of 
jurisdiction, Ontiveros, 82 Hawaiʻ i at 449, 923 P.2d at 391, and the district
court retained jurisdiction to proceed with Kwong’s sentencing.  If, however,
the district court had proceeded on the license revocation matter on April 
13, 2018, and had entered an appealable “final judgment,” but another notice 
of appeal was not filed within thirty days thereafter, the thirty- day 
deadline for filing a notice of  appeal under HRAP Rule 4(b
)(1) would have 
passed by the time this appeal was dismissed by the ICA on February 22, 2019. 
 
  
 
10  The issue of whether Joshua should be extended to premature notices of 
appeal from district court criminal cases that may be consistent with HRAP 
Rule 4(b)(4) is not before us at this time, and we do not address it.  We do 
note, however, that only a sm all percentage of the 3,334 “civil actions” 
filed in state circuit courts in fiscal year 2019 will result in “final 
judgments” subject to Joshua’s remand requirement, but a significantly higher 
percentage of the 27,932 “criminal actions” filed in state dis trict courts 
could result in “judgments” being filed that do not meet Kilborn finality 
(continued. . .) ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
15 
  Second, as we noted in Joshua, Jenkins  finality 
requirements resulted in numerous dismissals of appeals from 
intended and purported “final judgments .”  Joshua, 141 Hawaiʻi at
97 n.9, 405 P.3d at 533 n.9.  D ismissals based on non- compliance
with Jenkins finality requirements were sometimes due to circuit
court civil cases involving numerous parties and claims.   As 
compared to circuit court civil judgments, however, similar 
issues have not arisen based on finality requirements for 
district court criminal judgments.
   1211 
 
 
Finally, and as noted earlier , Joshua applied to circuit 
court civil judgments so titled and intended to be “final 
                                                                  
(. . . continued) 
requirements for appellate purposes.   See, State of Hawai ʻi Judiciary, 2019 
Annual Report Statistical  Supplement 12, 25 (2019), available at 
https://perma.cc/CN89- LYU8.  Thus, requiring the ICA to remand for entry of 
final judgments in district court criminal cases in which a final decision 
has been “announced” but a premature notice is  filed before entry of final 
judgment could result in a significant administrative burden on the ICA, 
because (1) premature notices of appeal could be filed  in a significant 
number of district criminal cases; and (2) in those cases, the ICA would need 
to ascertain whether remand for entry of final judgment would be consistent 
with HRAP Rule 4(b)(4).   
 
11  For example, in circuit court civil cases, there are sometimes many  
parties in addition to a plaintiff and a defendant, such as additional 
plaintiffs, additional defendants, third -party and additional third -party 
defendants, cross- claim and additional cross -claim defendants, and 
counterclaim and additional counterclaim defendants.  All of those parties 
can assert claims against each other; some claims are asserted against some 
parties, but not others.  The circuit courts must then endeavor to provide 
detailed dispositions of each claim in final judgments.   
 
12  Although district court criminal judgments can involve more than one 
defendant with more than one charge, the ICA’s 1995 opinion in Kilborn made 
clear that “[j]udgments of conviction are not final [for purposes of

 judgments” by circuit court judges.   In comparison, t his appeal 
arose because a notice of appeal was filed by McPherson and 
Arrisgado before Kwong’s sentencing was completed; on its face, 
the March 14, 2018 judgment of guilt, which only included 
Kwong’s partial sentence, never purported to be a “final 
judgment” meeting Kilborn requirements.   
Therefore, we decline to expand Joshua  to district court 
criminal cases.  
2. The ICA did not abuse its discretion in imposing the 
sanctions orders, which were grounded on HRAP Rule 51, and 
in denying the motion for reconsideration  
 
Counsel discuss the procedural history, summarized in 
Sections II.A through C above, and contend the ICA “exhalt[ed] 
form over substance ” when it imposed sanctions and denied the 
motion for reconsideration on the grounds the July 11, 2018 
amended statement of jurisdiction did not suggest the ICA should  
dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction,  but rather stated 
that the “case must be remanded to the district court for entry 
of a final judgment. ”  
 As noted above, a court’s imposition of sanctions is 
reviewed for an abuse of discretion, and when a sanctions order 
is based on a violati on of a cou rt rule, there is an a buse of 
discretion if the court bases its ruling on an erroneous view of 
the law or erroneous assessment of the evidence .  Gap, 106 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 Hawaiʻi at 331, 104 P.3d at  918.  If a sanction is not imposed 
under a statute or court rule, however, a court may not invoke 
its inherent powers to sanction an attorney without a specific 
finding of bad faith.  Bank of Hawaii v. Kunimoto, 91 Hawaiʻi 372, 
389, 984 P.2d 1198, 1215 (1999) (citations omitted). 
 The ICA’s February 13, 2019 sanctions orders were 
explicitly based on HRAP Rule 51, entitled “Sanctions,” which 
provides: 
Any attorney of record or party in a case, who fails to 
comply with any of the provisions of the Hawai ‘i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure, the Hawai‘i Electronic Filing and 
Service Rules, or any order of the court shall be subject 
to monetary or other sanctions by the appellate court 
before which such case is pending, such sanctions to be 
levied by order of the appellate court or by order of any 
judge or justice thereof.  
 
It is undisputed that Kwong’s opening brief was not timely 
filed.  Upon filing a notice of appeal, pursuant to HRAP Rule 
28(b) (2016) , an appellant must file an opening brief within 
forty days after the filing of the record on appeal.  The record 
on appeal in this case was filed on May 29, 2018 , making Kwong’s 
opening brief due July 9, 2018.   The ICA’s May 29, 2 018 notice 
expressly notified Counsel that Kwong’s openi ng brief was due on 
that date. 
Although it would not have made sense under the 
circumstances for Counsel to file an opening brief by the July 
9, 2018 due date, Counsel did not file their amended statement ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
18 
 of jurisdiction indicating there was no appealable final 
judgment until two days after the due date.  In it, Counsel 
incorrectly asserted , “This case  must be remanded to the 
district court for entry of a final judgment.”13   
Counsel did not even file anything in direct response to 
the July 17, 2018 memorandum from the ICA.  Counsel’s January 
17, 2019 response to the ICA’ s January 7, 2019 order to show 
cause then quoted Kilborn, and stated that based on their July 
11, 2018 amended statement of jurisdiction indicating no final 
judgment had been filed, “Kwong’s attorneys have been waiting 
for this court to dismiss this appeal and remand this case to 
the district court for entry of a judgment.”  Contrary to this 
assertion, Counsel had never previously indicated that dismi ssal 
of the appeal was required due to a lac k of appellate 
jurisdiction.14  In fact, on certiorari, they make clear that the 
statement in their amended statement of jurisdiction that 
“[t]his case must be remanded to the district court for entry of 
                     
13  See Section IV.A.1, supra. 
14  As discussed, u nder the circumstances of this case, dismissal of the 
appeal, not remand for entry of final judgment, was required.  Sentencing 
regarding license revocation was never completed so a final judgment was not 
entered.   
 
 Even when a court lacks subject matte r jurisdiction, however, it 
retains jurisdiction to impose sanctions  in order to “maint[ain] orderly 
procedure. ”  See Willy v. Coastal Corp. , 503 U.S. 131, 137 -39 (1992) 
(affirming district court’s imposition of Rule 11 sanctions despite lack of 
subject matter jurisdiction) .   
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
19 
 a final judgment” was intended to mean exactly what it said:  
Counsel were demanding that the ICA remand the case for entry of 
a final judgment, rather than dismiss the appeal.   
The ICA’s sanctions orders also noted that the amended 
statement of jurisdiction was not a motion to dismiss, and it 
was not until Counsel were ordered to show cause that Counsel 
represented that the appeal should be dismissed for lack of 
appellate jurisdiction, a position they again now contravene on 
certiorari, arguing that the ICA should have remanded the case 
for entry of a judgment pursuant to Joshua.  
At bottom, nothing was filed by the due date of the opening
brief and Counsel could have and should have alerted the ICA to 
the lack of appellate jurisdiction well before that date, which 
would have prevented the appellate clerk’s July 17, 2018 
memorandum and the ICA’s January 7, 2019 order to show cause.  
 For all of these reasons, the ICA did not abuse its 
discretion in entering the sanctions orders against Counsel.  
The ICA also did not abuse its discretion  by denying the motion 
for reconsideration, which did not present a basis in law as to 
why sanctions should not be imposed.  See HRAP Rule 40 (b) (2000)  
(a motion for reconsideration “shall state . . . the points of 
law or fact that the moving party contends  the court has 
overlooked or misapprehended  . . . .” ).   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 B. The ODC was without authority to treat the sanctions orders 
as administrative dispositions that might be used in the 
future as evidence of a pattern of conduct in aggravation  
 We now turn to address the March 14, 2019 ODC letters to 
Counsel.  The letters stated as follows: 
This office has been informed by the Intermediate Court of 
Appeals (“ICA”) that you were sanctioned in the above 
related case for violation of an applicable rule of court, 
or appellate procedure.   The 1Hawaiʻi Rules of Professional 
Conduct (“HRPC”) provides that “[a] lawyer shall not: .  
. . 
(e) knowingly disobey an obligation under the rules of a 
tribunal . . . ”  Thus, the sanctioned conduct is likely 
“misconduct” within the disciplinary rules of the Hawai ʻi 
Supreme Court.  
 
However, we also note that the ICA order did not contain a 
specific instruction for ODC to review your conduct for 
possible institution of disciplinary charges (which it 
often does).  Thus, we chose to deem this referral as an 
informational event, and elect to dispose of the matter 
administratively.  Administrative  disposition means that 
this event is not docketed as a “disciplinary complaint” 
and thus no formal record of d
isciplinary history will be 
created. 
 
However, a record of this administrative disposition will 
be maintained in our internal fi les.  Should the ICA, or 
other complainant, allege similar or more serious 
misconduct in the future, this administrative disposition 
might be used as evidence of a pattern of conduct in 
aggravation.   Thus it would behoove you to keep this an 
isolated or “one -off” event.   2
 
1 Monetary sanctions are permitted by, inter alia, 
HRAP Rule 51.  
 
2 See e.g.,:  ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer 
Sanctions (rev. 1992), Standard 9.22(c).  
Each letter contained an assigned ODC case number in the 
headings. 
 
 The record does not contain any referral from the ICA to 
the ODC of the sanctions orders
.  The ODC listed ICA as the 
“complainant” in each of the letters.  
A “complainant” is ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
21 defined by the Rules of the Disciplinary Board (“RDB”) Rule 3(d) 
(2011) as “a person who has expressed dissatisfaction with an 
Attorney to the ODC.”  It is unclear from the  record whether the 
ICA actually expressed dissatisfaction with Counsel to the ODC 
and, if so, how.  
In any event, the ODC indicated it was treating the 
sanctions orders as “informational event[s]” and that it was 
disposing of the matter administratively, resulting in an 
“administrative disposition.”  The Rules of the Supreme Court of 
Hawaiʻi (“
RSCH”) Rule 2.6(b)(2) (2013) requires, however, that an 
attorney be afforded an opportunity to be heard prior to the ODC 
recommending or undertaking any  disposition:  
Except in matters requiring dismissal because the complaint 
is frivolous on its face or falls outside the Board’ s 
jurisdiction, no disposition shall be recommended or 
undertaken by [Disciplinary] Counsel until the accused 
attorney shall have been afforded the opportunity to state 
[their15] position with respect to the allegations against 
[them]. 
Counsel were not afforded an opportunity to state their 
positions to the ODC with respect to the allegations against 
them.  Thus, the ODC’s “ administrative disposition s” are not 
authorized by RSCH Rule 2.6(b).  
15“They, them, and their” are used as singular pronouns when (1) the 
gender identity of the person referred to is unknown or immaterial; or (2) 
those are the pronouns of a specific person.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
22 
  In addition, the ODC  letters also stated that the 
unauthorized “administrative disposition s” could be used as 
evidence of aggravation, and cited to ABA Standards for Imposing 
Lawyer Sanctions (“ABA  Standards”)  Standard 9.22(c), which 
allows “a pattern of misconduct” to be considered as aggravating 
evidence in formal disciplinary proceedings.  See RDB Rule 
23(a)(iv).  “Aggravating factors or circumstances may justify an 
increase in the degree of disc ipline to be imposed.”  Office of 
Disciplinary Counsel v. Au , 107 Hawai ‘i 327, 344, 113 P.3d 203, 
220 (2005) (internal bracketing and quotations removed)  (quoting 
ABA Standards, Standard  9.21, at 15 (1991)) .  “Misconduct” is 
further defined by RSCH Rule 2.2 (2008) as “[a]cts or omissions 
by an attorney which  violate the Hawai ‘i Rules of Professional 
Conduct[.] ”   
 
The ODC indicated the sanctions orders were “likely 
misconduct” based on HRPC Rule 3.4 (e) (2014), which provides in
part that “[a] lawyer shall not: . . . (e) knowingly disobey an
obligation under the rules of a tribunal . . . .”  (Emphasis 
added.)  The RDB require the ODC, however, to investigate “all 
matters involving alleged violations of the Hawa
iʻi Rules of 
Professional Conduct in accordance with RSCH [Rules] 2.6(b)(2)  
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
23 
 and 2.6(b)(3).”16  RDB Rule 12  (2013).  There is no indication 
that the ODC conducted an investigation to determine whether 
Counsel had “knowingly” violated a n obligation under a co urt 
rule.  Further, formal disciplinary proceedings require that 
attorney misconduct be established by “clear and convincing 
evidence,” a standard not required for sanction orders.  RSCH 
Rule 2.7(c) (2019).   
Court sanctions  orders can be issued for reasons that would 
not constitute a “knowing” violation of a n obligation under a 
court rule based on “clear and convincing evidence.”  Monetary 
sanctions are sometimes imposed on counsel for late appearances 
or filings or for exceeding page limits set by court rules, 
                     
16  RSCH Rule 2.6(b)(2) &  (3) provide as follows:  
2.6. Disciplinary counsel.  
. . . . 
(b) Powers and duties of Chief Counsel. Chief Counsel 
shall have the power and duty:  
 . . . . 
(2) To dispose, subject to review by members of the 
Board assigned by the Chairperson, of all matters 
involving alleged misconduct by dismissal, private 
informal admonition, referral to a minor misconduct 
or assistance program, or the institution of formal 
disciplinary proceedings before a hearing committee 
or officer. Except in matters requiring dismissal  
because the complaint is frivolous on its face or 
falls outside the Board ’s jurisdiction, no 
disposition shall be recommended or undertaken by 
Counsel until the accused attorney shall have been 
afforded the opportunity to state [their] position 
with respect to the allegations against [them]. 
(3)  To file with the supreme court certificates of 
conviction of attorneys for crimes.  
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
24 
 without the issuing judge having intended for the sanctions 
orders to be considered “misconduct” that could be considered as 
“aggravating” factors in later disciplinary proceedings.  Thus, 
court sanction orders must not be treated by the ODC as 
referrals for investigation of misconduct without an express 
referral to the ODC by the court .  If there is such a referral, 
ODC must follow the procedure set out by applicable rules, 
including providing an attorney with the due process protections 
provided by the rules.  Therefore , even after a specific 
referral by a judge, t he ODC may not consider orders for 
sanctions as evidence of aggravation under ABA Standard 9.22(c) 
unless a determination has been made through the procedures set 
forth in the RSCH and RDB that the sanctioned conduct is a 
“clear and convincing” and “knowing” violation constituting 
“misconduct” under the HRPC. 
For these reasons, the ODC was 
without authority to treat 
the ICA sanction orders as  administrative dispositions that  
might be used in the future as evidence of a pattern of conduct 
in aggravation.   
V. Conclusion 
 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the ICA’s sanctions 
orders against Counsel, but also order that the clerk of the ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 court transmit this opinion to the ODC for appropriate action 
consistent with this opinion.
