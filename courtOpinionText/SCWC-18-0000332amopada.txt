AMENDED OPINION OF THE COURT BY RECKTENWALD, C.J.  
I. INTRODUCTION
Israel Vega Malave was convicted in the Family Court 
of the First Circuit on two counts of Sexual Assault in the 
First Degree for sexually assaulting his pre-teen stepdaughter Electronically Filed

2 over a period of approximately two years. 1 This case requires us 
to review two issues: the jurisdiction of the family court to 
try Malave and the prop riety of instructing the jury on a lesser 
included offense.
The Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) rejected 
Malave’s argument that the family court did not have 
jurisdiction, and that it should have instructed the jury on the
lesser included offense of Sexual Assault in the Third Degree 
(Sexual Assault 3).  The ICA therefore affirmed the family 
court’s judgment.  Malave asks this court to address the 
following two issues that he contends were incorrectly resolved 
by the ICA: 
1.Whether the ICA gravely erred in holding that
the family court had subject matter jurisdiction
pursuant to Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) § 571-
14(a)(1); and
2.Whether the ICA gravely erred in finding that
there was no rational basis in the record to supportproviding the jury instruction of the lesser included
offense of sexual assault in the third degree.
We conclude that the ICA did not err in affirming the 
family court.  Although the jury should have been instructed to 
determine jurisdictional facts, the error was harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt because the uncontroverted evidence showed that 
Malave had physical custody of CW. 
1The Honorable Shirley M. Kawamura presided.  
 
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 Moreover, the family court was not obligated to 
instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of Sexual 
Assault 3 because the record did not contain a rational basis to 
acquit Malave of Sexual Assault 1 and convict him of Sexual 
Assault 3.  Accordingly, we affirm
 the family court’s judgment. 
II.  BACKGROUND

 guardian or any other person having legal or physical 
custody of [CW], did knowingly engage in sexual penetration 
with [CW], who was less than fourteen years old, by 
inserting his finger into her genital opening, thereby 
committing the offense of Sexual Assault in the First 
Degree, in violation of Section 707- 730(1)(b) of the Hawai‘i  
Revised Statutes.  
 
Counts 4-6 charged Malave with Sexual Assault in the 
Third Degree pursuant to HRS § 707-732(1)(b)(2014): 
COUNT 4: On or about September 30, 2008 to and including

violation of Section 707- 732(1)(b) of the Hawai‘ i Revised 
Statutes.  
 
COUNT 6: On or about September 30, 2008 to and including 
September 19, 2013, in the City and County of Honolulu, 
State of Hawai‘i, ISRAEL VEGA MALAVE, being the parent or 
guardian or any other person having legal or physical
 
custody of [CW], who was not married to [CW], and knew he 
was not married to [CW], did knowingly subject to sexual 
contact, [CW], a person who was less than fourteen years 
old or did cause CW to have sexual contact with him, by 
placing her hand on his penis thereby committing the 
offense of Sexual Assault in the Third Degree, in violation 
                                                 
3  In 2016, the Hawai‘i  Legislature amended the definition of “sexual 
contact” to remove the exemption for married persons.  Sess. L. 2016, ch. 231 § 32 (effective Jul. 1, 2016).  HRS § 1- 3 indicates that this change would 
only apply prospectively, so at the time of the alleged conduct, the exemption for married persons applied.

 of Section 707- 732(1)(b) of the Hawai‘ i Revised Statutes.  
 
A. Relevant Trial Testimony 
It was undisputed that Malave and CW began living 
together, along with CW’s mother, when CW was five years old.  It was further undisputed that on September 20, 2013, when she 
was eleven years old and in sixth grade, CW told her school 
counselor that Malave had been touching her inappropriately.  
The last instance of alleged assault was two days prior to CW 
reporting this information to her counselor.  According to CW’s 
testimony, she had been in trouble for drinking alcohol at 
school on the day she made the report. 
CW’s school counselor testified that, when CW reported 
sexual abuse to her, she immediately reported this information to her administrator and called the police.  Honolulu Police 
Department (HPD) Officer Kalae Phillips responded to the call.   
Officer Phillips testified that he interviewed CW; 
during the interview, CW reported sexual abuse since the age of 
seven, beginning with Malave undressing her and touching her in 
inappropriate places, and eventually leading to forced sex.   
Officer Phillips further testified that Malave was 
arrested in the parking lot of CW’s school that same day, when he arrived to pick CW up.  
 
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
6 
 In her testimony at trial, CW testified that she had 
never been married.  CW referred to Malave as her stepfather.  
She indicated that Malave was a strict parent at times, and that 
she did not think of him as her father. 
With respect to Malave touching CW’s breasts and 
buttocks, CW testified that, beginning when she was seven or 
eight years old, Malave “would start touching [her] on [her] 
boobs or [her] butt, or he would start rubbing [her] thighs.”  CW testified that when he touched her during this period of 
time, he touched her with his hands.  CW testified that this 
happened “occasionally, sometimes two to three times a week, or 
whenever [her] mom wasn’t home.”  This contact allegedly 
happened in CW’s bedroom or Malave’s bedroom.  CW testified that 
Malave touched her both over her clothes and under them.  With 
respect to Malave touching her breasts, CW said that she was 
“starting to develop” breasts at that time (when she was seven 
or eight).  When asked to explain how Malave would touch her, CW stated that “he would rub his hands in circular motions across” 
her breasts or buttocks.  While this happened, Malave would tell 
CW that he liked it, or tell her to stay still if she wanted to 
move.  CW testified that she did not like it when Malave touched 
her, that she felt “gross” and “embarrassed,” “didn’t like 
[her]self,” and “felt like something was wrong with [her]” that  
 
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
7 
 made Malave touch her.  Malave told CW that if she told anyone 
what was happening, he “would do the same thing to [her] little 
sister or hurt [her] family.”  CW took that threat to mean that 
Malave would hurt CW’s mother, CW’s siblings, or anyone on CW’s 
mother’s side of the family.  CW believed that Malave could hurt 
these individuals because he was “bigger and stronger” than her.  
CW knew that Malave had been in the military, and that made her 
think Malave would “really hurt” her family.
 
With respect to Malave having CW touch his penis, CW 
next testified that, beginning when she was seven or eight years old, Malave would grab her arm and try to put her hand on his 
penis.  Malave succeeded in putting CW’s hand on his penis one 
time.  CW testified that she did not want to touch Malave’s 
penis and that she was “scared,” “felt grossed out,” and “wanted 
to run away.”  CW could not say precisely where her mother was 
when this happened, but testified that her mother was either at 
work or in her (her mother’s) bedroom.
4  CW testified that Malave 
continued to place his hands on her breasts and buttocks until 
                                                 
4  CW provided more details about this incident later in her testimony.  
She stated that this happened “before he forced [her] to have sex with him” 
when his pants were off but her clothes were still on.  She tried to pull her arm back but Malave told her to stop.  CW stopped trying to fight him and let 
him place her hand on his penis.  He told her to be “gentle” and “careful” 
and had her move her hand back and forth.  CW eventually stopped and Malave 
did not force her to continue.  CW testified that she remembered nothing else 
from that incident.  
 
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
8 
 approximately September 18, 2013, two days before she disclosed 
the abuse. 
With respect to penetration of CW’s vagina with 
Malave’s penis, CW went on to testify that the first incident 
involving this type of penetration was when she was ten or 
eleven years old.  CW testified that she was in the bathroom 
about to take a shower on “a late night” when her mother was not 
home.  Malave came into the bathroom, picked her up and put her on the bathroom sink counter, and inserted his penis into her 
vagina.  CW testified that this hurt and was uncomfortable.  
Afterward, she felt sick, hated herself, and wanted to run away.  
CW testified that there were “multiple” incidents after the 
first one, though she could not recall specifics of any other 
incident or say how many there were altogether.
 
For these later incidents, the prosecutor elicited 
testimony from CW that appeared to describe how contact with 
Malave usually went, and did not focus on particular instances.  
The following exchange was not limited to any particular time 
aside from CW’s statement that sexual penetration began when she 
was about ten years old: 
Q: Okay. When the defendant would take you to your 
bedroom or to his bedroom that he shared with your 
mom, would he take you to the bed? A: Yes. 
Q: What position would you be in on the bed? 
A: I would be lying on my back.  
 
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
9 
 Q: And what about his body? 
A: He was over me. 
Q: What about his arms? 
A: They were both to the side of me. 
Q: And what would he be doing with his hands? 
A: He would be touching my boobs or my butt.5 
Q: What about the rest of his body? 
A: It was over me. 
Q: And what would he be doing with his body? 
A: He would – that’s when he would insert his penis 
inside my vagina, and that’s when his body would be 
moving back and forth. 
 
CW testified further that “[o]ccasionally,” Malave 
penetrated her vagina with his fingers.  She stated that it felt 
“[u]ncomfortable.”  This happened either in CW’s bedroom or in 
Malave’s. 
CW also testified that Malave inserted his penis into 
her mouth.  In general, what led up to oral penetration 
according to CW’s testimony was Malave grabbing CW by the arm 
and telling her to open her mouth and be careful.  CW testified that she was scared when this happened and felt like vomiting.  
Again, CW did not attach any particular time to this type of 
contact.  CW’s testimony was phrased in general terms and 
appeared to describe what would normally happen during her 
sexual interactions with Malave.  
CW testified that, when Malave penetrated her vagina 
with his penis, “a white substance came out.”  CW knew that it 
                                                 
5  Because Malave was allegedly touching CW’s breasts and buttocks during 
penetration, this conduct could serve to establish Counts 1, 4, or 5.  
 
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
10 
 was a white substance because she could “feel it, or if he would 
move, [she] would see it on him.”  Although she did not know 
what it was at that time, it looked like a “thick cream.”  She 
testified that Malave never wore a condom. 
After sexual interactions, CW testified that Malave 
took her clothing and washed it while CW took a shower.  She 
stated that she did not know why he made her give him her 
clothing and take a shower.  At one point, the washer in her house broke, so Malave washed her clothing by hand in the sink. 
 
  
Malave gave CW gifts when she was ten or eleven: a new 
Apple computer for Christmas, an iPad, and a rose. 
CW explained that the abuse occurred one to two times 
per week, when CW’s mother was not home, until September 20, 
2013, when CW disclosed the abuse to her school counselor. 
CW testified that after she told her counselor what 
was happening, she was placed into foster care, where she spent 
approximately one-and-a-half weeks.  She further testified that she now lives on the mainland with her grandparents who are her 
legal guardians. 
CW also testified in an interview conducted by HPD 
Detective Vince Legaspi.  Detective Legaspi spoke with CW on 
September 21, 2013.  On cross-examination, defense counsel had 
CW confirm that she did not tell Detective Legaspi that Malave  
 
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
11 
 “rubbed [her] boobs in a circular motion.”  CW stated that she 
told Detective Legaspi about Malave touching her breasts and 
buttocks, although she did not specifically describe the 
touching as “a circular motion.”  CW said that she didn’t tell 
Detective Legaspi “most of the stuff” that she told the 
prosecutor’s office because she was embarrassed.  CW did, 
however, tell Detective Legaspi that Malave had forced her to 
have sex with him.  She chose to tell him this because “that’s what scared [her] the most.”
 
Defense counsel also elicited testimony from CW in 
which she admitted that she did not talk about Malave touching 
her breasts or buttocks when she testified in front of the first 
grand jury in this matter on September 24, 2013.  Defense 
counsel also pointed out that CW answered “no” when Dr. Guliz Erdem, the physician who examined CW after she reported sexual 
abuse, asked her whether Malave fondled her. 
With respect to oral sex acts, defense counsel went on 
to elicit CW’s testimony that she did not tell her school counselor, Officer Phillips, Detective Legaspi, or the first 
grand jury that Malave put his penis in CW’s mouth.  She did, 
however, say this to Dr. Erdem and in the second grand jury 
proceeding held in 2017. 
Defense counsel also pointed out that at the first  
 
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
12 
 grand jury proceeding, CW said that Malave took her clothes off, 
and at the second, she said she took her own clothes off.  CW 
also testified that, when Malave ejaculated, the ejaculate went 
on to CW’s bed.
 
Dr. Erdem testified that on September 20, 2013, she 
examined CW at the Sex Abuse Treatment Center.  Dr. Erdem 
further testified that during CW’s examination, CW reported that 
Malave: (1) penetrated her vagina with his penis; (2) put his 
fingers in her vagina; (3) caused oral contact between CW and 
Malave’s genitals; (4) caused CW to masturbate him; and (5) 
ejaculated, but that Malave did not fondle or kiss CW.  Dr. 
Erdem testified that CW had two “indentation cleft[s]” on her 
hymen - one on each side at the 9:00 and 3:00 positions (using 
the face of a clock for reference).  The cleft at the 9:00 
position was “very, very deep.”  Dr. Erdem said that a cleft is 
considered “deep” in medical terms when the cleft passes “50 
percent of the lip.”  Dr. Erdem testified that the clefts, 
“especially the deep one,” could be consistent with a sexual 
trauma - “any object penetrating the hymen opening,” including a 
penis, finger, or other object. 
Scott Henderson, criminalist at HPD’s forensic biology 
lab, was qualified at trial as an expert in serology and 
forensic DNA testing.  Henderson performed tests to detect semen  
 
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
13 
 on vaginal swabs taken from CW on September 20, 2013.  He found 
no evidence of semen on the swabs.  He also tested a bed sheet 
that CW took from her bed in November 2013 and gave to her 
grandmother.  Henderson testified that he found no evidence of 
semen on the sheet.  Finally, Henderson explained that he tested 
CW’s vaginal swabs for Malave’s DNA and found none.  He 
testified that there are a number of explanations for lack of 
semen in the vaginal canal after sex, including that there was no ejaculation, condom use, showering, swimming, douching, or 
menstruation.
 
CW’s grandmother also testified at trial to several 
anecdotes in which CW’s behavior could have suggested Malave was 
acting inappropriately toward her.  At a family dinner at her 
home, grandmother reported that CW refused to sit next to 
Malave.  According to grandmother’s testimony, one day when 
Malave dropped CW off at her home for a visit, CW ran upstairs 
to the master bathroom and got in the shower, where she stayed for approximately 45-60 minutes.  Grandmother explained that 
when she checked on CW, she saw CW laying on the floor of the 
shower.  Grandmother further testified that Malave had a 
vasectomy in the spring of 2012. 
Malave rested after the State’s case-in-chief.

 B. 
Jury Instructions 
The family court instructed the jury on Counts 1 to 3 
with the elements of Sexual Assault 1 and did not instruct the 
jury on the lesser included offense of Sexual Assault 3.  The 
family court also did not instruct the jury as to the 
jurisdictional facts, specifically that it must find that Malave 
had legal or physical custody of CW. 
C. Conviction and Sentencing 
The jury returned a verdict on November 1, 2017, 
finding Malave guilty of Counts 1 and 3.  The jury could not reach a unanimous decision on Counts 2 and 4 to 6.  The State 
declined to re-try Malave on Counts 2 and 4 to 6.  On March 13, 
2018, Malave was sentenced to 20 years each for Counts 1 and 3, 
to be served concurrently. 
D. Post-Trial Procedure 
Malave filed a motion to set aside judgment.  The 
basis was that the family court lacked jurisdiction because it did not make an on-the-record finding that Malave had physical 
or legal custody over CW.  The family court scheduled a hearing 
on the motion to dismiss for May 11, 2018, but Malave filed his 
notice of appeal to the ICA on April 13, 2018 and then withdrew 
the motion to dismiss on May 10, 2018. 
The ICA affirmed Malave’s conviction, concluding that  
 
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
15 
 the family court had jurisdiction, and that Malave was not 
entitled to a lesser included offense instruction for Counts 1 
and 3.
 
E. Supreme Court Proceedings  
Malave timely filed an application for certiorari with 
this court raising the following two questions: 
1. Whether the ICA committed grave error when it 
found that the family court had subject matter 
jurisdiction pursuant to HRS § 571-14(a)(1), despite 
the uncontroverted evidence that Petitioner was not the legal parent, guardian, and/or having physical custody of the Minor Complainant. 
 
2. Whether the ICA committed grave error when it 
found that there was no rational basis on the record 
to support providing the jury instruction of the lesser included offense of sexual assault in the 
third degree. 
 
III.  STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Jurisdiction 
“[A] court's jurisdiction to consider matters brought 
before it is a question of law which is subject to de novo 
review on appeal applying the ‘right/wrong’ standard.”  State v. 
Lorenzo, 77 Hawai‘ i 219, 220, 883 P.2d 641, 642 (Ct. App. 1994)  
(citations omitted).   
B. Jury Instructions 
We clarified the standard of review for jury 
instructions that were not objected to at trial was clarified in 
State v. Nichols, holding that: ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
16 although as a general matter forfeited assignments of error 
are to be reviewed under [Hawaiʻi Rules of Penal Procedure 
(HRPP)] Rule 52(b) plain error standard of review, in the 
case of erroneous jury instructions, that standard of 
review is effectively merged with the HRPP Rule 52(a) 
harmless error standard of review because it is the duty of the trial court to properly instruct the jury.  As a 
result, once instructional error is demonstrated, we will 
vacate, without regard to whether timely objection was 
made, if there is a reasonable possibility that the error 
contributed to the defendant's conviction, i.e., that the erroneous jury instruction was not harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt.
 
Id. at 337, 141 P.3d at 984 (footnote omitted). 
In the context of lesser included offense jury 
instructions, “this court has held that when jury instructions 
or the omission thereof are at issue on appeal, the standard of 
review is whether, when read and considered as a whole, the 
instructions given are prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, 
inconsistent, or misleading.”  State v. Flores, 131 Hawai‘ i 43, 
57-58, 314 P.3d 120, 134-35 (2013) (citations, alterations, and
quotation marks omitted).
IV. DISCUSSION
We conclude that the family court had jurisdiction to 
preside over Malave’s trial, and he was not entitled to a lesser 
included offense instruction on Counts 1-3.  A. Jurisdiction

19 that it must find beyond a reasonable doubt that Malave 
satisfied these criteria.  State v. Iuli, 101 Hawai ‘i 196, 207
65 P.d 143, 154 (2003).8, 
We conclude that when a jury trial is conducted in 
family court in a case subject to HRS §  571-14(a), the jury 
should be instructed by way of a special interrogatory to find 
whether the defendant had physical or legal custody of the 
complaining witness.  Because many family court judges are 
also circuit court judges, pursuant to Adams, lack of physical 
or legal custody alone may not justify an acquittal.   
If the 
jury finds that the defendant did not have physical or legal 
custody of the CW, and the presiding judge is both a family 
court judge and a circuit court judge, the judge has 
jurisdiction in the capacity of a circuit court judge.9
2. Failure to Instruct the Jury on Jurisdiction Was
Harmless
“[W]here uncontradicted and undisputed evidence 
of . . . jurisdiction . . . is contained in the record, the 
trial court’s failure to instruct the jury is harmless beyond a 
8Iuli thus implicitly overruled the holding in State v. Alagao, 77 
Hawai‘i 260, 262, 883 P.2d 682, 684 (App. 1994), that “ the court, not the 
jury, decides the facts relevant to the question of subject matter 
jurisdiction.”   
9We also note that while HRS § 571-14 allows the family court “exclusive 
original jurisdiction” over certain cases, it also allows waiver of that 
jurisdiction.

 reasonable doubt.”  Id.  Malave’s application incorrectly states 
that there was “uncontroverted” evidence that Malave did not 
have legal or physical custody of CW at the time of the 
offenses.  While it is clear that Malave did not have legal 
custody of CW, he has not presented any argument, or pointed to 
any evidence, showing that he did not have physical custody of 
CW.   
“‘Physical custody’ means the physical care and 
supervision of a child.”10  HRS § 583A-102.  The evidence in the 
record instead shows that Malave did have physical custody of CW 
for the reasons the ICA noted: CW lived with her mother, Malave, 
and CW’s two half-siblings; Malave watched and cared for CW while her mother was at work; Malave cooked meals, did laundry, 
disciplined CW, and sometimes helped her with homework; and CW 
was expected to follow Malave’s rules and obey him.  Failure to 
instruct the jury on jurisdiction was thus harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt. 
B. Lesser Included Offense Instruction  
1. Third-Degree Sexual Assault is a Lesser Included 
Offense of First-Degree Sexual Assault 
 
The definitions of Sexual Assault 3 and Sexual Assault 
                                                 
10  Alagao, 77 Hawai‘ i a t 263, 883 P.2d at 685, relied on a statutory 
definition of “physical custody” that the legislature amended in 2002.  2002 
Haw. Sess. Laws Act 124.  We thus no longer rely on the definition as stated 
in Alagao.    
 
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
21 
 1 are identical save for one term - where Sexual Assault 1 uses 
the term “sexual penetration,” Sexual Assault 3 uses the term 
“sexual contact.”  At the time of Malave’s offense, “sexual 
contact” was defined as: 
[A]ny touching, other than acts of ‘sexual 
penetration’, of the sexual or other intimate parts 
of a person not married to the actor, or of the 
sexual or other intimate parts of the actor by the 
person, whether directly or through the clothing or 
other material intended to cover the sexual or other 
intimate parts.   
 
HRS § 707-700 (1972) (emphasis added). 
“Sexual penetration” was (and is) defined as: 
(1) Vaginal intercourse, anal intercourse, fellatio, deviate sexual intercourse, or any intrusion of any 
part of a person’s body or of any object into the 
genital or anal opening of another person’s body; it 
occurs upon any penetration, however slight, but emission is not required. As used in this definition, 
‘genital opening’ includes the anterior surface of 
the vulva or labia majora; or 
 
(2) Cunnilingus or anilingus, whether or not actual penetration has occurred. 
 
HRS § 707-700. 
Our initial analysis is whether the presence of the 
exemption for married persons in the definition of “sexual 
contact” excluded Sexual Assault 3 from being a lesser included 
offense of Sexual Assault 1.  We conclude that it did not. 
The definition of a lesser included offense is set 
forth in HRS § 701-109(4): 
(a) It is established by proof of the same or less 
than all the facts required to establish the 
commission of the offense charged; ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
22 (b)It consists of an attempt to commit the offense
charged or to commit an offense otherwise included
therein; or
(c)It differs from the offense charged only in the
respect that a less serious injury or risk of injury
to the same person, property, or public interest or a
different state of mind indicating lesser degree of
culpability suffices to establish its commission.
At the time, Sexual Assault 3 required that the 
perpetrator was not married to the victim.  Therefore, it 
appears initially that Sexual Assault 3 is not an included 
offense in Sexual Assault 1 pursuant to (4)(a) because it 
requires proof of an additional fact - that the perpetrator and 
victim were not married.  This court laid out the elements of 
first-degree and third-degree sexual assault in State v. Arceo, 
84 Hawai‘ i 1, 14-15, 928 P.2d 843, 856-57 (1996).  In Arceo, we 
recognized that third-degree sexual assault required proof of an 
element that first-degree sexual assault did not, namely that 
the perpetrator “was aware that the Minor was not married to 
him.”  Id. at 15, 928 P.2d at 857.  But the Arceo court was not 
asked to decide whether the additional element excluded Sexual Assault 3 from being included in Sexual Assault 1.  
Cases from this court and the ICA have assumed that 
Sexual Assault 3 is a lesser included offense of Sexual Assault 
1. See, e.g., State v. Behrendt, 124 Hawai‘ i 90, 108, 237 P.3d
1156, 1174 (2010) (affirming the circuit court’s decision to 
 
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
23 
 instruct the jury on Sexual Assault 3 as a lesser included 
offense of Sexual Assault 1); State v. Mueller, 102 
 391, Hawai‘i
397-98, 76 P.3d 943, 949-50 (2003) (vacating conviction of 
Sexual Assault 1 and remanding to the circuit court with 
instructions to enter a judgment of conviction of the lesser 
included offense of Sexual Assault 3) (superseded on other 
grounds by statute as stated in Behrendt); State v. Abdon, No. 
CAAP-13-86, 2014 WL 4800994, at *6 (App. Sep. 26, 2014) (vacating the circuit court’s judgment based on its failure to 
instruct on the lesser included offense of Sexual Assault 3 for 
the charge of Sexual Assault 1) (citing Behrendt, 124 Hawai‘ i at 
109-10, 237 P.3d at 1175-76); State v. Miller, No. 27065, 2007 
WL 318166, at *1 (Haw. Ct. App. Jan. 30, 2007) (noting, though 
neither affirming nor reversing, that the circuit court vacated the jury’s guilty verdict on the first-degree sexual assault 
charge and entered judgment on the lesser included offense of 
third-degree sexual assault).
11  None of these cases discuss the 
significance of the fact that “sexual contact” included the 
requirement that the perpetrator and victim were not married, 
which appears to exclude Sexual Assault 3 from inclusion in 
Sexual Assault 1 pursuant to HRS § 701-109(4)(a).  
                                                 
11  All of these cases were decided before the Legislature removed the 
exemption for married couples from the definition of “sexual contact.” ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
24 The most logical and simplest resolution of this 
apparent conflict lies in HRS §
 701-109(4)(c), which defines a 
lesser included offense to be one which “differs from the 
offense charged only in the respect that a less serious injury 
or risk of injury to the same person.”  Sexual contact - short 
of penetration - carries a less serious injury or risk of injury 
to the victim.  This reconciles the additional element that 
Sexual Assault 3 contained at the time of Malave’s alleged offenses with the proposition that it is a lesser included 
offense of Sexual Assault 1. 
The case law on included offenses under HRS § 701-
109(4)(c) explains that the subsection applies where “there may 
be some dissimilarity in the facts necessary to prove the lesser 
offense, but the end result is the same.”  State v. Kinnane, 79 
Hawai‘i 46, 55, 897 P.2d 973, 982 (1995) (citations omitted).  
This court applies the following factors to determine whether an 
offense is included pursuant to subsection (c): “(1) the degree 
of culpability; (2) the degree or risk of injury; and (3) the 
end result.”  Id.  
In State v. Kinnane, we found that sexual assault in 
the fourth degree was an included offense in attempted sexual ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
25 assault in the second degree  pursuant to HRS § 701-109(4)(c).  
Id. at 56, 897 P.2d at 983.  Much of the reasoning of Kinnane is 
helpful here.13  
In analyzing the second factor, injury or risk of 
injury, the Kinnane decision states that “‘sexual contact’ (i.e. 
‘any touching of the sexual or other intimate parts of a 
person,’) . . . is ‘less serious’ than the risk of ‘sexual 
penetration’ (i.e. any intrusion of any part of a person’s 
body . . . into the genital . . . opening of another person’s 
body.)" Id. (second and third ellipses in original). In12
12The court wrote: 
A person commits the offense of attempted sexual 
assault in the second degree . . . if the person 
intentionally engages in conduct which, under the circumstances as the person believes them to be, 
constitutes a substantial step in a course of conduct 
intended or known to be practically certain to subject another person to an act of sexual 
penetration that the person is aware is by compulsion. 
. . . . 
A person commits the offense of sexual assault in the fourth degree . . . if the person knowingly subjects 
another person to sexual contact by compulsion or 
causes another person to have sexual contact with the 
actor by compulsion. 
79 Hawai‘i at 53-54, 897 P.2d at 980 -81. 
13For the first factor, the Kinnane court found that the requisite state 
of mind of attempted second- degree sexual assault is a combination of 
knowledge and intent, while the requisite state of mind of fourth- degree 
sexual assault is knowledge.  Id. at 55, 897 P.2d at 982. This does not apply 
to Malave’s case because the requisite state of mind for both first- and 
third-degree sexual assault is knowledge.  HRS §§ 707-730(1)(b), 707-
732(1)(b).  
 
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
26 
 Kinnane, therefore, it was immaterial that the two offenses at 
issue - attempted sexual assault in the second degree and sexual 
assault in the fourth degree - did not require proof of any 
injury as an element of the offense.  The sexual contact or 
sexual penetration itself could also be viewed as the injury in 
Malave’s case.  See State v. Buch, 83  308, 313, 926 P.2d Hawai‘i
599, 604 (1996) (noting that, where two offenses both require 
some type of sexual contact to establish their commission, the 
two offenses “require proof of the same injury”). 
Finally, the Kinnane court found that the third 
factor, the end result of each offense, weighed in favor of 
finding that Sexual Assault 4 was a lesser included offense of 
attempted Sexual Assault 2.  79 Hawai‘ i at 56, 897 P.2d at 983. 
“In both instances the victim . . . is placed in jeopardy of 
being injured or is being injured by the defendant’s conduct.”  
Id. (quoting State v. Feliciano, 62 Haw. 637, 639, 618 P.2d 306, 
308 (1980) (ellipsis in original) (brackets in original omitted)).   
Based on Kinnane, we conclude that Sexual Assault 3 is 
an included offense of Sexual Assault 1 pursuant to HRS § 701-
109(4)(c).   
2. There Was No Rational Basis for the Jury to Acquit 
Malave of First-Degree Sexual Assault But Convict Him 
of Third-Degree Sexual Assault  
 
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
27 
  
Although Sexual Assault 3 is a lesser included offense 
of Sexual Assault 1, the family court was not required to 
instruct the jury on it.  As noted above, “[A] ‘trial court is 
not obligated to charge the jury with respect to an included offense unless there is a rational basis in the evidence for a 
verdict acquitting the defendant of the offense charged and 
convicting him of the included offense.’”  State v. Flores, 131 
Hawai‘i 43, 50, 314 P.3d 120, 127 (2013) (quoting State v. Kupau, 
76 Hawai‘ i 387, 390, 879 P.2d 492, 495 (1994)).  
Malave points to four pieces of evidence that he 
argues contradict or call into question CW’s testimony: (1) CW’s 
statement to her school counselor that Malave had been “touching 
her inappropriately”; (2) CW’s statement to Officer Phillips 
that Malave had forced her to have sex with him, without 
specifically defining “sex” as penetration; (3) CW’s statement 
on cross-examination that it was “possible” that Malave had only 
touched her inappropriately;14 and (4) what Malave called Dr. 
Erdem’s “leading questions” during CW’s examination at the Sex 
Abuse Treatment Center. 
                                                 
14  This argument misstates the trial testimony.  During cross- examination, 
CW said that she did not remember exactly what she told the counselor on 
September 20, 2013, and that it was possible that she had told the counselor 
only that Malave was touching her inappropriately.  CW did not say that it 
was possible that Malave never penetrated her, which is what the certiorari 
application states.  
 
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
28 
 But these points are unavailing.  CW’s statements that 
Malave had been “touching” her are not evidence that Malave did 
not penetrate her.  Similarly, CW’s failure to provide a 
definition of “sex” does not support the contention that there 
was no penetration.  CW never stated that it was possible that 
Malave never penetrated her.  And Dr. Erdem’s questions were not 
unduly leading, nor would leading questions tend to show that 
Malave did not penetrate CW. 
Thus, after reviewing the record, we find that there 
was no rational basis in the evidence for a jury to acquit Malave of Sexual Assault 1 but convict him of Sexual Assault 3 
for the conduct underlying the Sexual Assault 1 charges.  As 
stated above, the alleged acts underlying the Sexual Assault 1 
charges were: (1) inserting his penis into CW’s genital opening; 
(2) inserting his penis into CW’s mouth; and (3) inserting his 
finger into CW’s genital opening.  In order to provide a 
rational basis to instruct the jury on Sexual Assault 3 for these counts, there must be some evidence presented that Malave 
merely made contact between his penis and CW’s genitals or 
mouth, or between his finger and CW’s genitals, that did not 
rise to penetration.15 
                                                 
15  The ICA seemed to conclude that Malave’s decision not to testify 
  
 
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
29 
  
 Given the lack of evidence to establish that only 
sexual contact, and not sexual penetration, occurred for the 
type of conduct alleged in Counts 1 to 3, there was no rational 
basis for a jury to acquit Malave of Sexual Assault 1 while 
convicting him of Sexual Assault 3 for this alleged conduct.  
Several ICA decisions on the subject of lesser 
included offense instructions rely on this court’s opinion in 
Behrendt, 124 Hawai‘ i 90, 237 P.3d 1156.  We thus take this 
opportunity to clarify that prior decision.  In Behrendt, the 
trial court instructed the jury on the lesser included offense 
of Sexual Assault 3.  124 Hawai‘ i at 108, 237 P.3d at 1174.  The 
jury acquitted the defendant of Sexual Assault 1, but convicted 
him of Sexual Assault 3.  Id. at 100, 237 P.3d at 1166.  On 
appeal, the defendant challenged the trial court’s decision to 
instruct on the lesser charge.  Id. at 108, 237 P.3d at 1174.  
This court affirmed the circuit court based on our conclusion that there was a rational basis to instruct the jury on the 
lesser charge, even though the evidence presented largely 
focused on penetration, reasoning that “a rational juror could 
                                                 
precluded satisfying the rational basis standard for the lesser included 
offense instruction.  This proposition is incorrect, as a defendant may not 
be penalized for exercising the right not to testify.  Chavez v. Martinez, 
538 U.S. 760, 768- 69 (2003).  Rather, there must be some evidence in the 
record that provides a rational basis to acquit of the greater offense and 
convict of the lesser, regardless of who presents that evidence and how.

30 
 have inferred that there was ‘sexual contact’ prior to the 
penetration.”  124 Hawai‘ i at 110, 237 P.3d at 1176 (emphasis 
added).  
ICA decisions holding that defendants were entitled to 
lesser included offense instructions for Sexual Assault 3 when 
charged with Sexual Assault 1 appear generally to treat Sexual 
Assault 1 as categorically requiring a lesser included offense 
instruction.  See State v. Wright, 144 Hawai‘ i 381, 442 P.3d 444, 
2019 WL 2148065, at *3 (unpublished) (App. May 16, 2019) 
(“[W]hen a complaining witness testifies that a defendant has 
committed an act of ‘sexual penetration,’ the trial court must 
also instruct the jury on the lesser included offense as it is a 
rational inference that ‘sexual contact’ also occurred.”); State 
v. Abdon, 2014 WL 4800994, at *7.  As shown by our analysis in 
the instant case, this interpretation of Behrendt is not 
correct.  The evidence in Behrendt, which this court explained 
in detail in the opinion, included evidence from which a jury could rationally conclude that the defendant committed Sexual 
Assault 3, but not Sexual Assault 1, during the conduct that the 
State alleged constituted Sexual Assault 1.  For example, in 
Behrendt, CW testified that the defendant “would have me sit on 
top of him, where he’s behind me, or he would have me straddle him.”  This conduct could constitute Sexual Assault 3, but

 because it does not speak of penetration, would not be 
sufficient to constitute Sexual Assault 1.  There was no similar 
evidence present in the record of Malave’s case.  We thus 
emphasize that, while evidence of Sexual Assault 1 may often 
support giving the lesser included offense instruction of Sexual 
Assault 3, this is a fact-specific inquiry rather than a 
categorical rule.  And in Malave’s case, the record did not 
support giving the lesser included offense instruction.
 
V.  CONCLUSION 
For the reasons above, we affirm the family court’s 
March 13, 2018 judgment of conviction and sentence and the ICA’s 
July 1, 2019 judgment on appeal.
