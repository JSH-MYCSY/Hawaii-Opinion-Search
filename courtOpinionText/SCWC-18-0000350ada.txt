 is set aside and a new trial ordered is not excludable under 
Hawaiʻi Rules of Penal Procedure (“HRPP”) Rule 48(c)(5)  (2000)1 
on the grounds the time period was “caused by th e . . . 
unavailability of the defendant.”  The Circuit Court of the 
First Circuit2 therefore erred in denying Defendant Charly 
Hernane’s (“Hernane”) motion to dismiss indictment for violation 
of HRPP Rule 48.  As Hernane’s conviction is set aside, we 
therefore need not address Hernane’s second question on 
certiorari as to whether the circuit court’s responses to jury 
communications constituted impermissible Allen charges.  See 
State v. Villeza, 72 Haw. 327, 334, 817 P.2d 1054, 1058 (1991)

Based on the Rule 48 violation, however, which requires 
dismissal of the charge against Hernane, we vacate the 
Intermediate Court of Appeal’s (“ICA”) January 11, 2016 j udgment 
on appeal and the circuit court’s October 22, 2013 judgment of 
conviction and sentence and remand this case to the circuit 
court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.3 
II. Background 
A. Factual and Procedural Background Preceding Trial on Remand4  
On May 18, 2011, a grand jury charged Hernane by indictment 
with murder in the second degree of his mother, Teresita Dumalan 
Hernane (“mother ”), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes 
(“HRS”) §§ 707-701.5 (Supp. 1986)5 and 706-656 (Supp. 1996).6  On 
                     
3  It is for the circuit court to address whether the Rule 48 dismissal 
should be with or without prejudice, applying the factors set out in State v . 
Estencion, 63 Haw. 264, 625 P.2d 1040 (1981): 
 
In determining whether to dismiss the case with or without 
prejudice, the court shall consider, among others, each of 
the following factors: the seriousness of the offense; the 
facts and the circumstances of the case which led to the 
dismissal; and the impact of a reprosecution on the 
administration of this chapter and on the administration of 
justice.  
 
Estencion, 63 Haw. at 269, 625 P.2d at 1044.  See also State v. Choy Foo, 142 
Hawaiʻi 65, 414 P.3d 117 (2018).  
 
4 The facts in this section are summarized from testimony at Hernane’s 
February 5, 2018 retrial.  
5 HRS § 707- 701.5 provides as follows:  ***  FOR PUBLI CATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 May 11, 2011, police were called to the mother ’s home after she 
was found dead with cuts and wounds to her head and neck.  A 
knife was found next to her body.  Hernane was located shortly 
thereafter in a nearby park with blood on his shirt and shorts.   
Hernane was initially convicted by a jury of murder in the 
second degree and sentenced to a term of life imprisonment with 
the possibility of parole.  A judgment of conviction and 
sentence was entered on October 22, 2013 .  Hernane appealed from 
the conviction and sentence to the ICA alleging prosecutorial 
                                                                  
(. . . continued)  
(1) Except as provided in section 707 -701, a person 
commits the offense of murder in the second degree if the 
person intentionally or knowingly causes the death of 
another person.  
(2) Murder in the second degree is a felony for which the 
defendant shall be sentenced to imprisonment as provided in 
section 706 -656.     
6  HRS § 706- 656(2) provides as follows:  
Except as provided in section 706 -657, pertaining to 
enhanced sentence for second degree murder, persons 
convicted of second degree murder and attempted second 
degree murder shall be sentenced to life imprisonment with 
possibility of parole.  The minimum length of imprisonment 
shall be determined by the Hawai[ʻ]i paroling authority; 
provided that persons who are repeat offenders under 
section 706 -606.5 shall serve at least the applicable 
mandatory minimum term of imprisonment.   
   
If the court imposes a sentence of life imprisonment 
without possibility of parole pursuant to section 706 -657, 
as part of that sentence, the court shall order the 
director of public safety and the Hawai[]i paroling 
authority to prepare an application for the governor to 
commute the sentence to life imprisonment with parole at 
the end of twenty years of imprisonment; provided that 
persons who are repeat offenders under section 706 -606.5 
shall serve at least the applicable mandatory minimum term 
of imprisonment.   ***  FOR PUBLI CATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 misconduct.  On January 11, 2016, the ICA entered a judgment on 
appeal pursuant to its November 30, 2015 memorandum opinion, 
State v. Hernane, CAAP -13-0005212 (App. Nov. 30, 2015) (mem.), 
vacating the circuit court’s October 22, 2013 judgment of 
conviction and remanding Hernane ’s case for a new trial.  The 
State filed an application for writ of certiorari to this court.    
 Meanwhile, on February 9, 2016, the circuit court held a 
hearing to set the retrial week.  Defense counsel explained that 
Hernane was not present bec ause he was “in prison in Arizona.”   
The State, through a deputy prosecuting attorney, informed the 
circuit court that it had filed an application for writ of 
certiorari, and the circuit court stayed the proceedings.   7
On March 23, 2016, this court reject ed certiorari.  This 
triggered the 180-day time period pursuant to HRPP Rule 48 for 
Hernane’s trial to commence .  See HRPP Rule 48.8   
B. Remanded Circuit Court Proceedings 
 On April 12, 2016, another status conference was held, at 
which the parties again discussed that Hernane was being held in 
Arizona.  On April 13, 2016, the deputy prosecuting attorney 
instructed paralegals  at the Honolulu Prosecutor’s Office to 
                     
7 The record does not reflect that  Hernane was serving any other prison 
term.

 contact the Department of Public Safety to arrange for Hernane’s 
return.   
On May 3, 2016, the circuit court held another hea
ring to 
set Hernane’s retrial.   Hernane was not present; defense counsel 
stated that Hernane “had not been transported from prison by 
airplane.”  The State represented that it had made a request to 
the Department of Public S afety (“DPS”) to have Hernane returned 
to Hawai i, and 
had been informed that he would be returned in 
July of 2016, but that the exact date was not disclosed for 
security reasons
.  
The State asked the circuit court to take under advisement 
any ruling on Rule 48 and stated that March 23, 2016 was 
“conceptually the restart  date for purposes of Rule 48 .”  
Defense counsel requested that trial not be set unless Hernane 
was present.  Over defense counsel ’s objection,  the circuit 
court set a trial date for August 1, 2016  and scheduled a trial 
call for July 19, 2016.  The circuit court stated it would “take 
under advisement the determination of Rule 48 excludability , if 
any, until such time as the issue is raised.”   
On July 13, 2016, based on the State’s request, the trial 
call was continued to July 22, 2016.  ***  FOR PUBLI CATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
7 
 . . . . Hernane was returned to Hawai i on July 19, 2016.  One 
hundred eighteen days had passed since certiorari had been 
rejected on March 23, 2016.   
On July 22, 2016, Hernane’s counsel made a n oral motion to 
continue, and trial was continued to the week of October 31, 
2016.  Thereafter, Hernane filed multiple continuances as well 
as motions regarding his fitness to proceed; he was not 
determined fit to proceed  until December 7, 2017 .  Hernane’s 
retrial was then scheduled for February 5, 2018.   
 On February 5, 2018, the day of 
his scheduled jury trial, 
Hernane filed a motion to dismiss indictment for violation of 
HRPP Rule 48 (“Rule 48 Motion”).  Hernane maintained that since 
March 23, 2016, a total of 684 days had passed, of which only 
the 503 days between 
July 22, 2016 and December 7, 2017 
qualified as excludable time periods for the purposes of HRPP 
Rule 48(c)(1) and (c)(3); Hernane conceded as excludable his 
requested continuances as well as proceedings relati ng to his 
fitness to stand trial.   Hernane alleged, however, that as of 9
                     
9 HRPP Rule 48(c)(1) and (c)(3) exclude the following time periods from 
Rule 48’s 180- day “commencement of trial” deadline:   
(1) periods that delay commencement of trial and are caused by  
collateral or other proceedings concerning the defendant, 
including but not limited to penal irresponsibility examinations 
and periods during which the defendant is incompetent to stand 
trial, pretrial motions, interlocutory appeals and trials of 
other charges;  
(continued. . .) ***  FOR PUBLI CATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
8 
 . . . . February 5, 2018, 181 days had elapsed since the rejection of 
the application for writ of certiorari on March 23, 2016 that 
were not excludable pursuant to HRPP Rule 48, requiring 
dismissal due to a violation of HRPP Rule 48.  
 The State opposed the Rule 48 Motion and asserted that  
because Hernane was being held pre- trial in Arizona, Hernane 
“must be deemed unavailable from May 3, 2016 to July 22, 2016.”  
 A hearing on the Rule 48 Motion was held that day,  February 
5, 2018.  The circuit court took judicial notice of the records 
and files in the case to calculate the time elapsed between the 
date certiorari was rejected and the date Hernane’s trial 
commenced, which would be later that same day, February 5, 2018.  
The State entered four exhibits into evidence, which contained a 
series of emails between the deputy prosecuting attorney and 
paralegals at the Honolulu prosecutor’s officer concerning 
Hernane’s return to Hawai ʻi. 
 The State called
 one witness, a paralegal at the Honolulu 
prosecutor’s office, to testify about the procedure used by the 
prosecutor’s office to return a defendan t housed in a mainland 
facility to Hawai i for trial.  The paralegal explained,  
                                                                  
(. . . continued)  
(3) periods that delay the commencement of trial and are 
caused by a continuance granted at the request or with the 
consent of the defendant or defendant's counsel;  
 ***  FOR PUBLI CATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 [w]hen we’re informed that the defendant is being 
housed in a mainland facility, we contact the 
Department of Public Safety.  Our contact is Howard 
Komori [“Komori”].  He handles -- he’s the 
administrator for inmates who are housed in a 
mainland facility.  
Q. [Deputy Prosecuting Attorney]  And could you 
explain for us in greater detail what the request is 
that you submit to Mr. Komori?  
A. [Paralegal] It’s -- w e usually either call or 
email him with our request for a specific inmate to 
be brought back to the  state, and we let him know 
that he needs to be brought back for trial[.]  
The paralegal further stated that on April 13, 2016, she 
received an email from the deputy prosecuting attorney 
requesting that 
she contact DPS to have Hernane brought back to 
the state for trial.  The paralegal further explained that 
thereafter she contacted Komori and was informed that Hernane 
would be brought back in July of 2016.
  The paralegal also 
testified that on April 26, 2016, she  sent another email 
updating the deputy prosecuting attorney that Hernane was still 
scheduled to return to Hawai ʻi 
in July 2016.  She testified that 
DPS decides when a defendant is brought back, and to her 
knowledge, the prosecutor’s office does not have any say as to 
when someone is brought back.  
 The paralegal also testified that,  on June 22, 2016, the 
deputy prosecuting attorney requested that she follow- up with 
Komori regarding Hernane’s return, which the paralegal did, and 
she was informed that he would be b rought back on July 19, 2016.  
She testified that, knowing that a trial call was scheduled for ***  FOR PUBLI CATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
10 
 July 19, 2016, she called the court to move the trial call to 
after the 19th and was given two dates, the 21st or 22nd of 
July.  The paralegal
 contacted Hernane’s counsel after obtaining 
the new July 22nd date.  On cross- examination, she testified 
that it was her understanding that Hernane was being brought 
back on the first regularly scheduled available flight back to 
Hawaii. 
 Hernane then argue d that he was not “unavailable” for 
purposes of HRPP Rule 48 for the period during which he was 
“housed on the mainland” because he “was in Hawai i State 
custody.”  Alternatively, Hernane argued that even if he was 
“unavailable ,” the State did not show it exercised due diligence 
to bring him back promptly. 
 The State argued that it had exercised due diligence in 
securing Hernane’s presence for trial, and thus, Hernane’s Rule 
48 Motion should be denied pursuant to State v. Jackson, 8 Haw. 
App. 624, 817 P.2d 130 (1991) .  The State argued “it was only on 
April 12th, 2016, when I [ the deputy prosecuting attorney] 
became aware” at an informal status conference that Hernane was 
being held in Arizona.10  The State further maintained that the 
“Honolulu prosecutor’s office does not tell [DPS] what to do and 
                     
10 But see text accompanying note 7, supra.   
   ***  FOR PUBLI CATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
11 
 (continued. . .)  when to do it” and their office had timely submitted the request 
and then had to “simply wait[] for [DPS’s ] response.”   
 After the parties completed their arguments, the circuit 
court noted that the disputed time period was March 23, 2016 up 
through and including the July 22, 2016, a total of 121 days,
 
during “the vast majority” of which Hernane was held in Arizona 
until he was returned on July 19, 2016 “or thereabouts.”  
Hernane asserted a viola tion of HRPP Rule 48 based on the 
passage of 181 unexcludable days, a difference of only one day 
from the requirement that trial commence within 180 days.  The 
circuit court clarified that it would rule alternatively, and 
proceeded to o ffer various calculations of excludable time 
periods, all of which supported its conclusion that there was no 
violation of HRPP Rule 48.  
In its first alternative, t he circuit court ruled that the 
118 days between the rejection  of certiorari on March 23, 2016 
until Hernane’s return to Hawai ʻi on July 19, 2016,
 were 
excludable.  In its second alternative, the circuit court ruled 
that the ninety-eight days from April 12, 2016, when the deputy 
prosecuting attorney
 allegedly  became aware that Hernane was not 
present in the State,11 until Hernane’s return on July 19,  2016, 
                     
11  Again, at the February 9, 2016 trial setting hearing  with the deputy 
prosecuting attorney present , Hernane’s counsel noted that Hernane was not ***  FOR PUBLI CATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
12 
 were excludable.  To reach this finding , the circuit court 
relied on Jackson, and found (1) that “the State, upon becoming 
informed of [Hernane’s whereabouts], made good -faith diligent 
efforts going forward to secure the attendance of the defendant 
for the anticipated retrial, ” and (2)  that the “July date” was 
not an “unreasonable delay” because it was “the first available 
scheduled return for mainland inmates.”  In its third 
alternative, the circuit court ruled that the 77 days from the 
May 3rd calendar call until Herna ne’s return on July 19th were 
excludable pursuant to HRPP Rule 48(c)(5) and (c)(8) and 
Jackson. 
On Februa ry 27, 2018 , the court entered its findings of 
fact, conclusions of law, and order denying Hernane’s Rule 48 
Motion consistent with its oral rulings.  
 Hernane’s jury trial commenced on February 5, 2018 after 
the Rule 48 hearing, and it lasted six days.  On February 15, 
2018, the jury returned a verdict finding H
ernane guilty of the 
lesser-included offense of manslaughter in violation of HRS § 
707-702(1)(a).   On April 17, 2018, the circuit court entered a 12
                                                                  
(. . . continued)  
present because he was being held in Arizona.  See text accompanying note 7, 
supra. 
12  HRS § 707- 702(1)(a) (Supp. 2011) provides in relevant part:  “A person 
commits the offense of manslaughter if  . . . [t]he person recklessly causes 
the death of another person  . . . .”  ***  FOR PUBLI CATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
13 
 judgment of conviction and sentence, sentencing Hernane, inter 
alia, to a twenty-year term  of incarceration. 
C. Appeal to the ICA 
 Hernane  timely appealed the circuit court’s j udgment of 
conviction and sentence to the ICA, basically repeating the 
arguments he made below and challenging the circuit court’s 
denial of his Rule 48 Motion.  In its April 11, 2019 summary 
disposition order, the ICA affirmed the circuit court’s  judgment 
of conviction and sentence.  State v. Hernane , CAAP-18-0000350, 
at 6, 11 (App. April 11, 2019) (SDO).  
With respect to the Rule 48 issue, relying on its holding 
in Jackson, the ICA noted that the HRPP does not define 
unavailability, but that the ICA had previously adopted the 
definition of unavailability from the Federal Speedy Trial Act, 
18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(3)(B) (1979):  “a defendant . . . . shall  be 
considered unavailable whenever his [or her] whereabouts are 
known but his [or her] presence for trial cannot be obtained by 
due diligence.”  Hernane, SDO at 3 (citing Jackson, 8 Haw. App. 
at 630, 817 P.2d at 135).   The ICA also opined that “‘[d]ue 
diligence is a fluid concept that must be determined on a case 
by case basis . . . .’ ”  Hernane, SDO at 3 ( quoting Jackson, 8 
Haw. App. at 630, 817 P.2d at 135).   ***  FOR PUBLI CATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
14 
  The ICA stated that the main issue was whether the State 
used due diligence to procure Hernane ’s return to Honolulu for 
retrial.  Hernane, SDO at 3-4.  The ICA determined that based on 
the paralegal’s testimony and the State’s exhibits, the circuit 
court had not erred and had corr ectly concluded that Hernane’s 
right to trial commencement under HRPP Rule 48 had not been 
violated. Hernane, SDO at 6. 
D. Application for Writ of Certiorari 
We address Hernane ’s first question on certiorari, w hether 
the ICA gravely erred in denying his motion to dismiss the 
indictment pursuant to HRPP Rule 48.   Hernane basically argues 
that the delay between March 23, 2016 and July 19, 2016, was not 
excludable because he was not “unavailable”  for purposes of HRPP 
Rule 48. 
III.  Standard of Review of HRPP Rule 48 Motion to Dismiss  
The appellate court reviews a trial court ’s decision on a 
HRPP Rule 48 motion to dismiss under both the “clearly 
erroneous” and “right/wrong” tests:  
 
A trial court’s findings of fact (FOFs) in 
deciding an HRPP 48(b) motion to dismiss are 
subject to the clearly erroneous standard of 
review. An FOF is clearly erroneous when, 
despite evidence to support the finding, the 
appellate court is left with the definite and 
firm conviction that a mistake has been 
committed. However, whether those facts fall 
within HRPP 48(b)’s exclusionary provisions is 
a question of law, the determination of which 
is freely reviewable pursuant to the 
“right/wrong” test.  ***  FOR PUBLI CATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

(1996)] (quoting State v. Hutch, 75 Haw. 307, 328 -29, 861 
P.2d 11, 22 (1993)).  
 
Choy Foo, 142 Hawai ʻi at 72, 414 P.3d at 124. 
IV. The time Hernane spent in Arizona in Hawaii ̒ State custody  
was not excludable under HRPP Rule 48(c)(5)  
 
Hernane asserts the ICA erred in affirming the circuit 
court’s denial of his Rule 48 motion by  holding that Hernane was 
“unavailable” for purposes of HRPP Rule 48(c)(5) while he was in 
Hawaiʻi State custody in an Arizona 
prison facility. 
“The purpose of Rule 48 is to ensure an accused a speedy 
trial, which is separate and distinct from his constitutional 
protection to a speedy trial. ”  Estencion , 63 Haw. at 268, 625 
P.2d at 1043.  Speedy trial rules are intended to prevent 
unreasonable delay in the determination of criminal actions that
“subvert[] the public good and disgrace[] the administration of 
justice[.]”  63 Haw. a t 268, 625 P.2d at 1043  (citing People v. 
Solomon, 70 N.E.2d 404 (1946)).  To accomplish this end, HRPP 
Rule 48(b) requires a court to dismiss the charge upon the 
defendant’s motion “ ‘if trial is not commenced within 6 months’  
of a relevant triggering date .”  Choy Foo , 142 Hawai ʻi at 72, 414
P.3d at 124.  The six-month period under HRPP Rule 48 is 
equivalent to 180 days.  See  State v. Hoey, 77 Hawaiʻi 17, 28, 
881 P.2d 504, 515 (1994).  Under HRPP Rule 48(c), there are 
“eight categories of delay that are to be excluded from  
 ***  FOR PUBLI CATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
16 calculating the time within which trial must commence.”  Choy 
Foo, 142 Hawai i at 72-73, 414 P.3d at 124- 25.  
At issue in this case is one of those categories, which 
excludes “periods that delay the commencement of trial and are 
caused by the absence or unavailability of the defendant .”  HRPP 
Rule 48(c)(5) (emphasis added).  What constitutes a “period[] 
that delay[s] the commencement of trial and [is] caused by the 
[] unavailability of the defendant” is not further defined 
within the HRPP.  
Based on the authority below, we hold that a defendant is 
not “unavailable ” for purposes of HRPP Rule 48 when he is in 
Hawaiʻi State custody and does not prevent his own transportation 
to court.  Cf. Mainwaring v. State, 11 So. 3d 986, 991 (Fla. 
Dist. Ct. App. 2009) ( “The bare refusal of one county to 
transport an accused person to another county where the speedy 
trial time is running is ordinarily not sufficient to establish 
that the accused is ‘unavailable’ for trial. ”).
 
In State v. Willoughby, 83 Hawai ʻi 496, 927 P.2d 1379 (App. 
1996), the ICA affirmed a trial court ruling that the 1,089 days 
between an indictment and when the defendant was served with a 
warrant for his arrest on the mainland was excludable under HRPP 
Rule 48(c)(5) because the period had been caused by the 
unavailability of the defendant.  83 Hawai ʻi at 501

 1384.  During the 1,089 days, despite “per iodically searching 
existing computer data bases,” the Honolulu Police Department  
(“HPD”) had been unable to find the defendant, who had left 
Hawaii̒ without leaving a forwarding address.
  83 
Hawaiʻi at 498, 
927 P.2d at 1381.  HPD only learned the defendan t’s whereabouts 
when they were contacted by the New Jersey prosecutor’s office 
regarding the outstanding warrant for the defendant’s arrest.  
Id. 
In Jackson, which the circuit court and the ICA relied upon 
in this case, although the defendant was imprisoned in Honolulu, 
the defendant was in federal custody.  See 8 Haw. App. at 628-
29, 817 P.2d at 13 5.  The ICA adopted the following definition 
of “unavailability” from the Federal Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. 
§ 3161(h)(3)(B): “a defendant . . . shall be considered 
unavailable whenever [the defendant’s] whereabouts are known but 
[the defendant’s] presence for trial cannot be obtained by due 
diligence[.]”  8 Haw. App. at 630, 817 P.2d at 134.13  The ICA 
held that the State had exercised due diligence to secure the 
defendant’s presence for his arraignment because the prosecuting 
attorney had contacted the United States Marshal’s office in  an 
attempt to have the defendant brought to the circuit court, but 
                     
13  As explained below, Jackson is inapplicable because Hernane  was not 
“unavailable.”  As the issue is not before us, we do not decide whether “due 
diligence” would satisfy the State’s burden in a case where a defendant is 
actually “unavailable.”  ***  FOR PUBLI CATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
18 the Marshal refused to deliver the defendant.  8 Haw. App.  at 
632, 817 P.2d at 135.  The ICA held , “[t]he 231 days between 
November 17, 1988, when the State first attempted to get the 
Marshal to produce Defendant, and July 6, 1989, when Defendant 
failed to appear for his eighth scheduled arraignment, was 
properly excluded pursuant to Rule 48(c)(5), HRPP.”   8 Haw. App. 
at 633, 817 P.2d at 136.  T he ICA posited that to determine 
whether due diligence was exercised, a court’s  “focus is on what  
was done by the state rather than on what was not done.”  8 Haw. 
App. at 632, 817 P.2d at 136- 37 (citing Ingram v. State, 703 
P.2d 415, 431 (Alaska Ct. App. 1985) ( “[P]rimary emphasis must
be on the reasonableness of the efforts actually made, not on 
the alternative that might have been made available.” )).  
Relying on Jackson , the State and circuit court ruled that 
the State had “exercised due diligence and made good faith 
efforts to return Defendant to Hawai ʻi for retrial[,]” and that, 
therefore, the time Hernane remained in Arizona was excludable 
under HRPP Rule 48(c)(5). 
Through various cases similar to Willoughby and Jackson, 
other state courts have addressed whether a defendant who 
becomes absent due to relocation to another state or 
incarceration by another state or federal government is 
“unavailable” during the time period it takes to obtain the ***  FOR PUBLI CATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
19 presence the defendant.  For example, the Supreme Court of 
Pennsylvania has held that where a defendant incarcerated in an 
out-of-state jail initially refused extradition, he was 
”unavailable” until he was returned to that state.  Commonwealth 
v. Stange, 428 A.2d 226 (Pa. 1981)
; see also People v. Garner,
74 Cal.Rptr. 298, 304 (Cal. Ct. App. 1990) (holding a defendant 
who resisted extradition was unavailable).  That court also 
ruled that a defendant who had “voluntarily absented” himself 
from that state was “unavailable” until after he was returned to 
the state after 
arrest in an extradition waiver.  Commonwealth 
v. Polsky, 426 A.2d 610 (Pa. 1981); see also State v. Hattori,
573 P.2d 829 (Ct. App. Wash. 1978)
 (holding that a defendant was 
unavailable until his arrest in California and return to 
Washington).  But here, Jackson is inapplicable because Hernane 
was not held by another jurisdiction,  but was in Hawaii State 
custody.  Accordingly, no due diligence inquiry is necessary 
because the State had the sole responsibility for transporting 
the defendant. ̒
There do not appear to be any reported cases regarding 
whether or not a defendant held in state custody in that state’s 
prison located in another state can be deemed “unavailable” in 
the custodial state.  Florida courts have held, however, that 
for purposes of Florida’s speedy trial rule, “if the charging ***  FOR PUBLI CATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
20 
 county has knowledge that the defendant is incarcerated in 
another county, the defendant is not considered ‘unavailable ’ 
for trial in the charging county. ”  Mainwaring, 11 So.  3d at 
989; see also State v. Steele , 624 N.W.2d 1, 8 (Neb. 2001) (“The 
primary burden of bringing an accused person to trial within the 
time provided by law is upon the State.”) .  The Colorado Court 
of Appeals held that defendants were not unavailable for 
purposes of that state’s Speedy Trial Act for the time they were 
in California based on a post -arraignment extradition or a 
waiver of extradition.  People v. Wimer , 604 P.2d 1183 (Colo. 
App. 1979).  In addition, the Supreme Court of Illinois held 
that where the state had voluntarily relinquished control over a 
defendant to federal authorities , the delay was attributable to 
the state.  People v. Swartz , 171 N.E.2d 784 (Ill. 1961).      
The absence of reported cases similar to Hernane’s 
situation is logical.  As indicated by the cases above, it is 
when a defendant has “voluntarily absented” himself from a state 
or when a state does not kn ow about or have control over the 
custody of a defendant in another state that a time period is 
excludable for speedy trial purposes for being “caused by the 
unavailability of the defendant .”  As pointed out in the 
American Bar Association Standards for Criminal Justice Relating 
to Speedy Trial:  “[a] defendant should be considered unavailable ***  FOR PUBLI CATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
21 
 whenever his whereabouts are known but his presence for trial 
cannot be obtained or he resists being returned to the state for 
trial.”  A MERICAN B A R ASSOCIATION STANDARDS FOR CRIMINAL J USTICE RELATING TO 
SPEEDY TRIAL, Standard 12 -2.3(e) (Supp. 1986)  (quoted in Jackson, 8 
Haw. App. at 630, 817 P.2d at 134 ); see also  People v. Moye , 635 
P.2d 194, 196 (Colo. 1981) (citing ABA Standard 12 -2.3(e)). 
 Under the ABA Standard, Hernane clearly was not 
“unavailable.”  His whereabouts were known,  but the requirement 
that “his presence for trial cannot be obtained” was simply non-
existent.  Hernane was in custody of the State of Hawai ʻi 
Department of Public Safety.  The State knew where he was and 
had control over his location;14 Hernane did not “voluntarily 
absent” himself to Arizona.  In addition, he did not “resist 
being returned to the state for trial.”  It was the State that 
failed to return him for 118 days although his conviction had 
been vacated; he was therefore a pre- trial detainee being held 
in a prison, not a jail.  As a pre- trial detainee, he should 
have promptly been returned to Hawai ʻi.  
                     
14  We reject the circuit court’s finding that “[t]he Honolulu Prosecut or’s 
Office exercises no control over [the Department of Public Safety].  Our 
county prosecutors have been delegated the primary authority and 
responsibility for initiating and conducting criminal prosecutions within 
their respective counties, but do so under the authority of the attorney 
general of the State of Hawai ʻi.  Ruggles v. Yagong, 135 Hawai ʻi 411, 418, 353 
P.3d 953, 960 (2015).  As agents of the State of Hawaii ̒, county prosecutors 
are obligated to fulfill the responsibilities of the State of Hawa iʻi in their 
prosecutions.  Whether the Honolulu Prosecutor’s Office exercises “control” 
over the Department of Public Safety is irrelevant  -- Hernane was in Hawai ʻi 
State custody and therefore was not unavailable.  ***  FOR PUBLI CATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
22 
  In addition, the circuit court and ICA in this case relied 
on Jackson as legal authority allowing exclusion of the time 
Hernane was held in Arizona from the Rule 48 calculation.  In 
Jackson, after citing the ABA Standard quoted above, the ICA 
adopted the Federal Speedy Trial Act’s definition of 
“unavailability” that 
“a defendant . . . shall be considered 
unavailable whenever [the defendant’s] whereabouts are known but 
[the defendant’s] presence for trial canno t be obtained by due 
diligence.”  8 Haw. App. at 630, 817 P.2d at 134- 35.  
Yet, the Federal Speedy Tria l Act itself would not have 
authorized the circuit court to exclude the bulk of the time 
period Hernane was held in Arizona.  18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(1)(F) 
expressly limits the excludable time resulting from 
transportation of defendants already within federal custo dy to 
ten days: 
[D]elay resulting from transportation of any defendant from 
another district, or to and from places of examination or 
hospitalization [are excluded], except that any time 
consumed in excess of ten days from the date an order of 
removal or an order directing such transportation, and the 
defendant's arrival at the destination shall be presumed to 
be unreasonable[.]  
HRPP Rule 48, on the other hand,
 does not contain this up- to-
ten-day leeway period for transporting defendants in the custody 
of the State of Hawai ʻi.  Thus, the legal authority on which the 
circuit court and ICA relied would not have allowed exclusion of ***  FOR PUBLI CATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
23 
 the time periods they deemed excludable under HRPP Rule 
48(c)(5).15 
V. Conclusion  
 For all of these reasons, the time Hernane spent in Arizona 
in State custody was not excludable under HRPP Rule 48(c)(5).  
The circuit court therefore erred in denying Hernane’s Rule 48 
Motion.  The Rule 48 violation requires dismissal of the charge 
against Hernane.  We therefore  vacate the ICA’s January 11, 2016 
judgment on appeal and the circuit court’s October 22, 2013                       
judgment of conviction and sentence and remand this case to the  
  
                     
15  Even for defendants held in the custody of another jurisdiction, 
the Federal Speedy Trial Act contains additional language contradicting 
the circuit court and ICA’s exclusion of the time Hernane continued to 
be held in Arizona.  18 U.S.C. § 3161(j)(1)(A)  contains language 
clarifying the expected action of a government attorney to secure a 
defendant’s presence for trial: “If the attorney for the Government 
knows that a person charged with an offense is serving a term of 
imprisonment in any penal institution, he shall 
promptly  . . . 
undertake to obtain the presence of the prisoner for trial [ .]”  18 
U.S.C. § 3161(j)(1)(A) (emphasis added).  The legislative history of 
the act provides that “[w]ith respect to the term ‘promptly’ as used in 
this subsection, the Committee intends that the attorney for the 
Government . . . shall initiate detainer or demand certificate 
procedures as soon after he becomes aware of the fact that the accused 
is imprisoned as is practicable.”  H.R. Rep. No. 93 -1508, at 22 -23 
(1974).  B ased on the record, the State did not act  promptly to seek 
Hernane’s return as the record reflects that the State knew Hernane was 
imprisoned in Arizona in February 2016, but did not make a request for 
Hernane’s return until April.  In addition, the State could have and 
should have flown Hernane back to Hawai ʻi promptly when his conviction 
was vacated, as he was then a pre -trial detainee, not a convicted 
felon.   ***  FOR PUBLI CATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***
