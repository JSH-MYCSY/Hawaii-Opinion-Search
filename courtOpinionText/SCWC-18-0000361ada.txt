OPINION OF THE COURT BY RECKTENWALD, C.J. 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
 This case involves a custody dispute between WW 
(Father) and DS (Mother).  Father sought joint legal and 
physical custody of the parties’ minor child (Child).  In 
October 2017, the case proceeded to a bench trial before the Electronically Filed
Supreme Court

2 Family Court of the Second Circuit.  The parties settled during 
the trial, and Father now contends that the family court used 
improper techniques to convince him to settle.   
As set forth below, it appears that the court spoke to 
Father alone without obtaining consent from counsel on the record, initiated settlement discussions and recommended 
specific terms on a highly-contested issue after trial had 
commenced, and by all appearances would have remained the 
factfinder had the parties not reached a settlement.  On these 
facts, we hold that the family court’s actions were improper.  Accordingly, the family court plainly erred, and the settlement 
agreement must be vacated.
 
II. BACKGROUND 
In October 2017, the family court held a bench trial 
regarding the custody of Mother and Father’s minor child.1  The 
custody proceedings were acrimonious and contested, particularly 
regarding whether Father should be allowed overnight visits with 
Child.  Both parties were represented by counsel during the 
custody proceedings. 
During the testimony of the court-appointed custody 
evaluator, who was Father’s expert witness, the family court took a lunch recess.  When the parties returned from the recess, 
                         
1  The Honorable Douglas J. Sameshima presided.  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
3 they told the family court they had reached an agreement.  
Counsel for Mother read the terms into the record with 
occasional corrections by Father’s counsel and suggestions from the family court an
d Father’s expert witness.  After Mother’s 
attorney finished reading the terms into the record, Father’s attorney stated, “Your Honor, um, we agree with what [Mother’s 
attorney] said.  Except there’s one thing I guess I failed to 
discuss with my client.  There were so many loose ends.”  
Father’s attorney went on to request that Father be allowed to 
initiate good night phone calls to Child, at which point the family court explained to Father that he was not barred from 
making calls to Child, and Father responded, “Oh, okay.”  At the 
end of the hearing, the family court told Mother’s counsel to 
put the agreement in writing, and the court would sign it.  
Neither Father nor Father’s counsel objected to the terms put on 
the record or asserted that Father did not agree to settle.   
Mother submitted a proposed Stipulated Order.  The 
next day, Father filed an objection, arguing that Mother’s 
Proposed Order did not reflect the parties’ on-the-record agreement.  The family court signed the Stipulated Order without 
acknowledging Father’s objections.  Neither Father nor his 
counsel signed the Stipulated Order.   
Father, through counsel, then filed a motion for 
reconsideration.  He contended that “[d]ue process demands that  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
4 this Court modify the Stipulated Order to conform with the 
settlement of October 25, 2017 as placed on the record at that 
time.”   
Although the family court never made specific findings 
about the circumstances that led to the settlement agreement, the parties submitted declarations during the ensuing dispute 
over the Stipulated Order that address the family court’s role 
in facilitating the agreement.   
 According to the declaration of Mother’s counsel, when 
counsel returned from lunch, the family court called the 
attorneys for both parties into chambers, where he “made it 
clear that he had concerns and suggested that the part[ies] 
attempt to settle the case using Mother’s Proposed Order.”  
Negotiations went on “with the help of the Judge . . . for a 
three hour period” according to a letter from Mother’s counsel 
to the family court.   
In his declaration attached to his motion for 
reconsideration, Father explained: 
3.  After my first witness . . . testified and was cross-
examined and after his written report was admitted into 
evidence, [the family court] called a recess so he could 
talk to the attorneys.  That was the beginning of a series of settlement discussions.  First, the attorneys came out 
of the Judge’s chambers to report what the judge had said 
and to discuss settlement along those lines.  On at least 
one more occasion, the attorney’s [sic] went back in the 
judge’s chamber to conference with him. 
 
4.
  At one point, I was invited into judge’s chambers to 
conference with him.  I was alone with the judge.  
He told 
me that he knew I was a good father but that he thought my  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
5 overnights with my four[-] year-old son should be introduced 
more gradually.  He strongly recommended one overnight a 
week for six months, then adding a second overnight.  
 
5.  I did not agree with the judge.  I thought I was 
perfectly capable of having our son on as many overnights 
as I could have.  I have taken a parenting class, I went 
through co
-parenting counseling with [Mother] for about 
five months and I co- parented our son when I was living 
with [Mother].  I’ve taken care of him when he was sick.  
I’ve taken care of him when he was an infant and was completely dependent on me.  But because I realized that 
the judge was adamant and, of course, that the decision was 
ultimately his, I agreed to his recommendation. 
 
(Emphases added.)   
At no point during the proceedings did Mother or 
Father’s attorney consent on the record to the family court 
meeting with their clients individually and without counsel 
present. 
The family court denied Father’s motion for 
reconsideration, and Father appealed pro se.   
Following the notice of appeal, the family court 
ordered the parties to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.  Father’s proposed findings, which he 
submitted while pro se, primarily recited the order of motions 
filed and how they were resolved.  However, the proposed findings did include a statement about how the family court 
facilitated the settlement: “During a pause in cross-
examination, this Court called a recess to talk to the attorneys 
about a possible settlement in chambers.  After the attorneys 
left, the judge met with the parties in chambers separately, ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
6 first [Father] then [Mother].”  Mother’s proposed findings, 
submitted by counsel, included specific findings that each 
provision in the Stipulated Order accurately reflected the 
transcript.  Mother’s proposed findings did not include any 
statements about the court speaking to Mother and Father without 
their attorneys.   
The family court entered its own findings of fact and 
conclusions of law, incorporating almost all of Mother’s 
proposed findings verbatim.  The family court neither adopted 
Father’s proposed finding about the court’s communications with 
Mother and Father while their attorneys were not present, nor 
made any independent findings regarding the issue.  But the 
court did find that “[a]fter the lunch break, there was a 
discussion between the Court and counsel for both parties, in 
chambers, during which counsel for the parties agreed that there 
would be a concerted effort to resolve the issues in the case 
without further testimony.”  Additionally, “[t]here was 
agreement to use Mother’s Exhibit AAA (Proposed Order) . . . as 
the template for the settlement negotiations between the parties 
and their counsel.”   
In its findings, the family court also specifically 
addressed each challenged provision in the Stipulated Order, 
finding the Stipulated Order consistent with the agreement put 
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
7 on the record.   In its conclusions of law, the court concluded, 
“There is no violation of due process as alleged by Petitioner 
in his Motion for Reconsideration.  Father presented no facts or legal basis to support such allegations.”  It also found, 
“Mother’s Stipulated Order, submitted to the Court on 
January 23, 2018, accurately reflects the agreement placed on 
the record as agreed to by the parties on October 25, 2017.”   2
On appeal to the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA), 
Father, who was pro se, argued the terms of the Stipulated Order 
did not reflect the terms of the agreement placed on the record.3  
Although Father did not argue that the family court’s ex parte 
communications with him were improper, he reiterated the family 
court’s involvement in the agreement: “Trial ended that day with 
a settlement because the judge called a recess in the middle of 
                         
2   The family court did acknowledge that two provisions — 
“Reimbursement by Father to Mother for his share of cost[s] for Custody 
Evaluation” and “Reimbursement of Preschool Expenses” — were not consistent 
with what was stated on the record, but the court did not strike those 
provisions from the Stipulated Order, even though Father had specifically 
objected to those terms.   
 
3  Father raised four specific points of error: (1) the family court 
erred in denying Father’s motion for reconsideration because the Stipulated 
Order “does not accurately nor comprehensively reflect the agreement made in 
the settlement proceeding as substantiated by the record on appeal and due 
process requires that it conforms to that record and any substantive issues 
in a [Hawaiʻ i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 60 motion] should be 
allowed a hearing”; (2) the Stipulated Order included express and implied 
provisions that were not agreed to, particularly the use of Mother’s P roposed 
Order “as a default order where there was no express agreement to do so on 
the record”; (3) “[d]ue process is denied where opposing counsel made 
misrepresentations in her declaration to fraudulently taint the proceedings”; 
and (4) the family court made erroneous findings of fact and conclusions of 
law.    
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
8 [Father’s expert witness’s] testimonial on cross-examination and 
asked the parties into chambers.”  Father requested that the ICA 
“reverse or vacate, as appropriate, the Family Court’s order[s] . . .  and remand to the Family Court to address the 
array of conflicting and existing issues to the Order in [an] 
equitable manner, in compliance with law, and with the spirit of 
co-parenting for the best interests of the child.”   
The ICA first implicitly concluded that Father 
knowingly and voluntarily entered into a settlement: 
The Family Court did not ask Father or Mother on the record 
whether they understood and agreed with the settlement 
terms that had been placed on the record, if they had any 
questions about what had just taken place, or if anyone was 
forcing, pressuring, or threatening either of them into 
settling.  However, Father and Mother were both represented 
by counsel . 
 
Quoting our decision in Associates Financial Services 
Co. of Hawai‘ i v. Mijo, 87 Hawai‘ i 19, 31, 950 P.2d 1219, 1231 
(1998), the ICA explained, “Courts presume that attorneys abide by their professional responsibilities; outside of disciplinary 
proceedings, we do not interfere with the attorney-client relationship and conduct relating thereto.”   
The ICA then addressed each of the family court’s 
findings of facts and conclusions of law that Father contested.  
Recognizing that “Father cannot be bound to a stipulation that 
was not either in writing and signed by him or his counsel, or 
made in open court — e.g., stated in the transcript of ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
9 proceedings,” the ICA found most of the challenged findings of 
fact and conclusions of law to be clearly erroneous after 
comparing each provision in the Stipulated Order to the 
transcript.   Accordingly, the ICA vacated the Stipulated Order  
and the family court’s Order Denying Reconsideration and 
remanded the case “to the Family Court for further proceedings 
consistent with this opinion.”   4
Father filed a pro se application for writ of 
certiorari arguing that “the ICA gravely erred by not remanding 
the case back to the Family Court to be retried where their 
opinion recognized there were improprieties in the lower court’s 
proceedings,” and “by not acknowledging that the Family Court 
judge’s unilateral decision to abruptly end the evidentiary 
hearing and call parties into chambers without their respective 
legal counsel was an abuse of discretion resulting in the 
failure to provide both parties their due process.”  He asked 
this court to “review the ICA’s Memorandum Opinion and affirm 
4The ICA found “substantial evidence in the record” supporting the 
family court’s finding that “the parties agreed [Mother’s] Proposed Order 
would serve as the template for the settlement, and that portions of the 
Proposed Order not modified would remain in the final order.”  But the ICA 
found that the Stipulated Order failed to accurately reflect the terms contained in the Proposed Order and modifications made on the record during 
the proceedings.  Specifically, while the transcripts supported findings of 
fact regarding Mother’s right to make final decisions and the cancellation of 
visits if Child is sick
, they did not support factual findings regarding 
drop-off and pick- up locations, telephone calls, the holiday schedule, co-
parenting classes, custody evaluation reimbursement, preschool reimbursement, 
or the Stipulated Order being “a true and accurate representation of the 
parties’ agreement” or the conclusion of law that the Stipulated Order 
“accurately reflects” the parties’ agreement on the record.

10 the ICA’s order to vacate the Stipulated Order and the Order 
Denying Reconsideration and remand this case back to the Second 
Circuit Family Court for retrial.”  
 
This court accepted Father’s application, and after 
the parties obtained counsel through the Hawai‘ i Appellate Pro 
Bono Program, permitted the parties to file supplemental briefs 
addressing “[w]hether the family court’s involvement in 
settlement negotiations during trial invalidates the parties’ 
settlement agreement.”   
III. STANDARD OF REVIEW 
Whether the parties entered into an agreement is 
“essentially a question of fact” the court reviews under the 
clearly erroneous standard.  Mijo, 87 Hawai‘ i at 28, 950 P.2d at 
1228 (citing Island Directory Co. v. Iva’s Kinimaka Enters., 10 
Haw. App. 15, 23, 859 P.2d 935, 940 (1993)).  
However, whether a settlement agreement is enforceable 
is “a conclusion of law reviewable de novo.”  Id. (citing 
Sylvester v. Animal Emergency Clinic of Oahu, 72 Haw. 560, 565, 
825 P.2d 1053, 1056 (1992)).  “[S]ince very important rights are 
at stake in most cases, appellate courts must strive to ensure 
that the purported compromise agreement sought to be enforced is 
truly an agreement of the parties.”  Id. at 29, 950 P.2d at 1229 
(emphasis omitted) (quoting Miller v. Manuel, 9 Haw. App. 56, 
63, 828 P.2d 286, 291 (1991)).  “To determine the validity of  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
11 the settlement agreement, the court looks to the totality of the 
circumstances surrounding the making of the agreement.”  Id. 
(quoting Ziarko v. Soo Line R.R., 641 N.E.2d 402, 410 (Ill. 
1994)). 
IV. DISCUSSION 
A. Plain Error 
As a threshold matter, Father’s arguments that the 
family court acted improperly in facilitating the settlement are unpreserved.  Before the family court, when Father was 
represented by counsel, he asserted only that “[d]ue process demands that this Court modify the Stipulated Order to conform 
with the settlement of October 25, 2017 as placed on the record 
at that time.”  Although Father’s declaration, attached to his 
motion for reconsideration, could have alerted the family court 
that Father felt pressured to agree to the settlement because it 
suggested that the court called him into chambers without his 
attorney and was “adamant” that Father agree to terms based on 
Mother’s Proposed Order, Father never argued that the family 
court’s involvement in the settlement negotiations was improper or that he did not voluntarily agree to settlement.  In fact, 
not only did Father never object when the settlement agreement 
was put on the record, Father repeatedly stated that the parties 
had reached an agreement on October 25, 2017.   
Moreover, even if Father’s declaration adequately  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
12 raised the issue before the family court, Father waived it 
before the ICA.  In his opening brief, Father did not argue that 
the family court’s involvement in the settlement negotiations was improper or that the ICA should remand the case for trial 
because he did not voluntarily agree to settle.  To the 
contrary, Father asserted that “the Stipulated Order does not 
accurately nor comprehensively reflect the agreement made in the 
settlement proceeding as substantiated by the record on appeal 
and due process requires that it conforms to that record,” and 
asked the ICA to vacate the Stipulated Order and “remand to the Family Court to address the array of conflicting and existing 
issues to the Order in [an] equitable manner[.]”  Accordingly, 
Father’s claims on certiorari have been waived. 
Nevertheless, we can review the family court’s actions 
in facilitating settlement for plain error. 
In civil cases, the plain error rule is only invoked when 
“justice so requires.”  We have taken three factors into 
account in deciding whether our discretionary power to 
notice plain error ought to be exercised in civil cases: 
(1) whether consideration of the issue not raised at trial requires additional facts; (2) whether its resolution will 
affect the integrity of the trial court’s findings of fact; 
and (3) whether the issue is of great public import. 
 
U.S. Bank Nat’l Ass’n v. Castro, 131 Hawai‘ i 28, 42, 313 P.3d 
717, 731 (2013) (quoting Montalvo v. Lapez, 77 Hawai‘ i 282, 290, 
884 P.2d 345, 353 (1994)).   
Mother argues that each of the three factors weighs 
against reviewing the family court’s actions for plain error.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
13 As to the first and second factors, she contends the record is 
undeveloped and that there are “virtually no facts that could 
support a conclusion the Family Court abused its discretion,
[5 ]much less engaged in conduct that ‘shocks the conscience.’”  
Further, she contends that plain error would entirely undermine 
the family court’s findings of fact.6  Similarly, Mother argues 
the third factor “cuts most severely against Father” because 
“the new judicial duty this Court is being asked to recognize 
would rewrite the traditional duties of judges and lawyers, 
especially in Family Court cases.”   
Mother’s contention that this court should not apply 
plain error review lacks merit, and we conclude that noticing 
plain error is appropriate under these circumstances.  First, 
additional factual findings are not necessary because the record 
does not demonstrate any factual dispute about the relevant 
aspects of the family court’s involvement in the settlement 
negotiations.  Father’s declaration that the judge called him 
5Although Mother analyzes the family court’s actions for an abuse 
its discretion, “[a] trial court’s determination regarding the enforceability 
of a settlement agreement is a conclusion of law reviewable de novo.”  Mijo, 
87 Hawai‘ i at 28, 95 0 P.2d at 1228 (citing Sylvester, 72 Haw. at 565, 825 P.2d 
at 1056); Balogh v. Balogh, 134 Hawai‘ i 29, 37– 38, 332 P.3d 631, 639– 40 (2014) 
(“Whether particular circumstances are sufficient to constitute duress is a 
question of law, although the existence of those circumstances is a question 
of fact.” (ellipsis omitted) (quoting Gruver v. Midas Int’l Corp., 925 F.2d 
280, 282 (9th Cir. 1991))).   
6Mother does not specifically indicate which factual findings 
would be undermined.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
14 14.After the lunch break, there . . . was a discussion
between the Court and counsel for both parties, in
chambers, during which counsel for the parties agreed that
there would be a concerted effort to resolve the issues in
the case without further testimony.
15.There was agreement to use Mother’s Exhibit AAA
(Proposed Order) . . . as the template for the settlement
negotiations between the parties and their counsel.
As to the second plain error factor, we conclude that 
resolution of Father’s due process claim will not undermine the 
integrity of the family court’s findings of fact.  Most of the 
family court’s factual findings concerned whether the terms of 
the agreement placed on the record matched the terms of the 
Stipulated Order the court later signed, and the ICA already 
7We also note that in her supplemental brief, Mother relied  on the 
facts in Father’s declaration to argue settlement was voluntary, contending 
the declaration is “[t]he only affirmative evidence in the record about the 
Family Court’s role in facilitating settlement[.]”   into chambers without his attorney and that the judge 
“strongly  recommended one overnight a week for six months” and
was “adamant” about that recommendation was uncontradicted.  
Mother’s response to Father’s motion for reconsideration states
that the court “called counsel into chambers and suggested 
negotiation” because of Father’s expert witness’s testimony.  The 
parties then reached an agreement “after a long negotiation at 
Court using [Mother’s] proposed Order . . . as directed by the 
Court.”  Moreover, the family court’s findings of fact, while 
containing less detail, are consistent with the foregoing 
accounts:  7 
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
15 held that many of those findings were clearly erroneous.  The 
family court’s remaining findings pertain to the history of the 
case and what was said on the record, none of which will be invalidated by holding that the family court’s ex parte 
communications were improper.  In other words, “there are no 
‘findings of fact’ whose ‘integrity’ could be ‘affected’ by the 
instant appeal[.]”  Alvarez Family Tr. v. Ass’n of Apartment 
Owners of Kaanapali Alii, 121 Hawai‘ i 474, 491, 221 P.3d 452, 469 
(2009) (citation omitted).    
Third, the propriety of judicial ex parte 
communications during settlement negotiations is a matter of 
great public importance because it implicates the fairness and 
impartiality of the judicial system.  See Moran v. Guerreiro, 97 
Hawai‘i 354, 373, 37 P.3d 603, 622 (App. 2001) (“Ex parte 
communications deprive the absent party of the right to respond 
and be heard.  They suggest bias or partiality on the part of the judge.” (citation omitted)).  Thus, reviewing Father’s 
contentions for plain error will safeguard the integrity of our 
judicial system.
8   
                         
8   We disagree with Mother’s contention that reviewing ex parte 
communications will create a “new judicial duty.”  As explained further in 
Part IV.B, this court has previously observed that trial courts should be 
wary of involvement that could coerce settlement, although we have not 
previously defined the parameters of that rule.  See Mijo, 87 Hawai‘ i at 28, 
30, 950 P.2d at 1228, 1230 (noting that “the judge must guard against 
indirectly coercing a settlement by ‘nudging’ or ‘shoving’ the parties toward 
settlement,” but holding that a judge may offer their assessment of the case 
and recommend settlement).    
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
16 B. 
The Family Court Committed Plain Error by Speaking to Father in Chambers Alone During a Bench Trial Without Obtaining the Consent of Father’s Counsel on the Record, 
and By Initiating Settlement Discussions and Strongly 
Recommending Father Agree to Specific Settlement Terms on a Contested Issue 
 
A court must look to the “the totality of the 
circumstances surrounding the making of the agreement” to 
evaluate the validity of a settlement.  Mijo, 87 Hawai‘ i at 29, 
950 P.2d at 1229 (quoting Ziarko, 641 N.E.2d at 410).  To 
determine whether a trial court impermissibly “nudged” or 
“shoved” the parties into settling, “the perceptions of all the 
players — judges, counsel, and litigants — are the key.”  Id. at 
28, 950 P.2d at 1228 (citation omitted).  “Whether particular circumstances are sufficient to constitute duress is a question 
of law, although the existence of those circumstances is a 
question of fact.”  Balogh v. Balogh, 134 Hawai‘ i 29, 37–38, 332 
P.3d 631, 639–40 (2014) (ellipsis omitted) (quoting Gruver v. 
Midas Int’l Corp., 925 F.2d 280, 282 (9th Cir. 1991)).  
The Hawai‘ i Revised Code of Judicial Conduct (HRCJC) 
permits judges to be involved in settlement negotiations: “A 
judge may encourage settlement of disputed matters in a 
proceeding but shall not act in a manner that coerces any party 
into settlement.”  HRCJC Rule 2.6(b).  In the commentary, the HRCJC sets out factors for a judge to consider in deciding to 
what extent the court should be involved in settlement  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
17 negotiations: 
The judge plays an important role in overseeing the 
settlement of disputes, but should be careful that efforts 
to further settlement do not undermine any party’s right to 
be heard according to law.  The judge should keep in mind 
the effect that the judge’s participation in settlement discussions may have, not only on the judge’s own views of 
the case, but also on the perceptions of the lawyers and 
the parties if the case remains with the judge after 
settlement efforts are unsuccessful.  Among the factors 
that a judge should consider when deciding upon an appropriate settlement practice for a case are (1) whether 
the parties have requested or voluntarily consented to a 
certain level of participation by the judge in settlement 
discussions, (2) whether the parties and their counsel are 
relatively sophisticated in legal matters, (3) whether the case will be tried by a judge or a jury and, if by a judge, 
whether he or she will be the settlement judge or another 
judge, (4) whether the parties participate with their 
counsel in settlement discussions, (5) whether any parties 
are unrepresented by counsel, and (6) whether the matter is civil or criminal. 
 
HRCJC Rule 2.6 cmt. 
As commentators have recognized, the line between 
permissible judicial encouragement and coercive judicial tactics 
is frequently unclear.  See Jaclyn Barnao, In Pursuit of 
Settlement: Deciphering Judicial Activism, 18 Geo. J. Legal 
Ethics 583, 588 (2005) (noting that the Model Code of Judicial Conduct, upon which the HRCJC is based, leaves open the 
question, “[W]here does the line between permissible persuasion 
and overbearing tactics lie?”); James J. Alfini, Risk of 
Coercion Too Great: Judges Should Not Mediate Cases Assigned to 
Them for Trial, 6 Disp. Resol. Mag., no. 1, Fall 1999, at 11 
(noting that “settlement culture” is “in a state of anarchy” because “[t]here are few rules to govern the behavior of judges . . . during settlement”).  “Courts should, and do, so  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
18 far as they can do so legally and properly, support agreements 
which have for their object the amicable settlement of doubtful 
rights by parties[.]”  Sylvester, 72 Haw. at 566, 825 P.2d at 
1057 (emphasis omitted) (quoting Ragland v. Davis, 782 S.W.2d 
560, 562 (Ark. 1990)). 
In Mijo, we recognized that “settlement can be 
coerced . . . by a strong judge in a settlement conference,” and explained that “throughout the settlement process, the judge 
must guard against indirectly coercing a settlement by ‘nudging’ 
or ‘shoving’ the parties toward settlement.”  87 Hawai‘ i at 28, 
950 P.2d at 1228 (citation and alterations omitted).  However, 
we also stressed that “a judge who is conducting a settlement 
conference acts within the bounds of propriety when he or she 
offers his or her assessment of a case as he or she understands it and recommends a settlement.”  Id. (citation and alterations 
omitted).  And we further explained that “the fact that settlement was reached on the eve of trial is inconsequential; a 
judge’s responsibility to encourage settlement does not diminish 
as trial approaches.”  Id. at 30, 950 P.2d at 1230. 
We have also recognized that, in the context of a 
settlement conference, it is appropriate for judges to be actively involved in crafting a settlement:   
[T]he judge who is likely to contribute most to the 
settlement dynamic is active rather than passive, 
analytical rather than emotional or coercive, learns the

19 facts and law involved in the dispute instead of relying on 
superficial formulas or simplistic compromises, and, after 
listening and learning with an open mind, offers explicit 
assessments of parties’ positions and specific suggestions for ways to reach solutions. 
 
Kamaunu v. Kaaea, 99 Hawai‘ i 503, 507, 57 P.3d 428, 432 (2002) 
(quoting William L. Adams, Let’s Make a Deal: Effective 
Utilization of Judicial Settlements in State and Federal Courts, 
72 Or. L. Rev. 427, 446–47 (1993)). 
However, in Kamaunu, when we encouraged judicial 
involvement in settlement, we also noted that the same judge 
would generally not preside over further proceedings as a 
factfinder.  Id. at 508, 57 P.3d at 433 (“[E]ven in a bench 
trial, the interests of the party litigants are similarly 
preserved because the settlement judge customarily would not 
preside over the trial, unless counsel and the parties 
affirmatively stipulate to the trial judge’s participation in 
settlement discussions.”). 
Although we sanctioned court involvement in settlement 
negotiations in Mijo and Kamaunu, we have not yet determined at 
what point a court crosses the line from permissible to coercive 
involvement.  Father argues the family court crossed this line: 
the family court’s actions “suggest[ed] a high probability of 
bias,” “create[d] the possibility of coercing the parties into 
settlement contrary to due process and the [HRCJC],” and 
“demonstrate[d] the appearance of impropriety.”  Accordingly,

20 Father contends the settlement agreement should be invalidated.  
 
Mother disagrees and argues that the family court 
acted within its discretion to facilitate a settlement because 
judges are encouraged to facilitate compromise, especially in 
family court “where disputes are highly personal, and emotions 
are often tied to decision-making.”  She also contends that 
Father was not coerced into the settlement agreement because 
“the totality of the circumstances show that Father voluntarily 
settled”: Father agreed to the family court’s recommendation; 
“Father was represented by a lawyer”; “neither Father nor his lawyer ever objected to the Family Judge’s facilitating role”; 
and “the factual record is bereft of any evidence that he was 
coerced by the Family Judge into settlement.”
  In conclusion, 
Mother asserts that “there is nothing extraordinary” or “unusual” about a court discussing settlement with a party.   
We agree with Father that the family court crossed the 
line from permissible to coercive involvement.
9  Here, it appears 
that the family court initiated the settlement discussions during trial, when it was acting as factfinder; it met with the parties without counsel present and without obtaining counsel’s 
                         
9  While we agree that the family court crossed the line from 
permissible to coercive involvement, we decline to adopt the restrictive rule 
that Father urges.  We do not agree that courts must “refrain from making unsolicited statements on settlement recommendations in chambers to the 
parties[.]”  To the contrary, as we explained in Mijo and Kamaunu, courts may 
and often should facilitate settlement, and doing so does not necessarily create the appearance of impropriety.

21 consent on the record; and it directed the parties to settle 
using Mother’s Proposed Order as a template.  These techniques, 
when considered in the totality, were improper and created the appearance of partiality, as well as an impermissible risk of 
coercing the parties to settle.  See Carrie Menkel-Meadow, For 
and Against Settlement: Uses and Abuses of the Mandatory 
Settlement Conference, 33 UCLA L. Rev. 485, 509 (1985) 
(identifying “suggesting a particular result . . . [and] 
directing meetings with clients or parties” as “coercive 
techniques”). 
We have not found any cases — in any jurisdiction — in 
which a court met with the parties in chambers individually without obtaining the consent of counsel on the record, and 
Mother has cited none.
10  In the few cases in which an appellate 
court has found that a trial court’s meeting with a party in chambers without counsel present was not per se coercive, the ex 
parte meeting took place with counsel’s consent — and even in 
those cases, appellate courts have still discouraged that 
practice. 
                         
10  Mother cites Franks v. Nimmo, 796 F.2d 1230, 1233 (10th Cir. 
1986), for the proposition that “meeting with a party without an attorney 
during a settlement conference” did not “give rise to an objective appearance 
of bias.”  Franks is not on point here.  Aside from the fact that the case 
did not involve the validity of a settlement agreement (it concerned 
mandatory recusal under federal statutes), in Franks, the trial judge spoke 
with the plaintiff about settlement “at the behest of his attorney, and with 
the concurrence of the defendants’ counsel[.]”  Id. at 1235 (emphasis added).

22 In Deicher v. Corkery, the California District Court 
of Appeal for the Second District explained that “interviewing 
litigants separately in chambers, even with the consent of counsel, in an effort to settle the case during the trial, is 
ill-advised.”  23 Cal. Rptr. 270, 274 (Dist. Ct. App. 1962).  
However, the court held that the trial court did not coerce 
settlement because “[t]he record . . . reflects that the court’s 
discussions with the parties were had with the full knowledge, 
acquiescence and approval of counsel and without the slightest 
suggestion of any objection,” and there was “no evidence of coercion, bias, or prejudgment on the part of the court.”  Id. 
at 273–74.  Similarly, in Chertkof v. Harry C. Weiskittel Co., 
the Maryland Court of Appeals noted that “generally, [the judge] 
should [facilitate settlement] through counsel and not deal with 
the parties alone,” but held that the judge did not act 
improperly where counsel had urged the judge to meet with the 
parties alone and the attorneys were kept apprised throughout 
the negotiations.  248 A.2d 373, 377 (Md. 1968). 
The Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division, 
has taken a stricter approach, instructing courts not to meet ex parte with the parties, even if both parties and their counsel 
consent, unless there are extraordinary circumstances present:  
We note that the trial court, perhaps with the best of 
intentions and albeit with the consent of the attorneys for 
both parties, held a pre- trial, ex parte conference with 
plaintiff in chambers during which it explored with her  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
23 some of the financial issues involved and solicited her 
views as to what she “envisioned” would be a fair 
settlement.  In our view, this practice is inappropriate 
and, except in the most extraordinary of circumstances, 
should not be employed by our trial courts, particularly in 
non-jury cases. 
 
Peskin v. Peskin, 638 A.2d 849, 858 n.1 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. 
Div. 1994) (emphasis added). 
We agree with the courts in California, Maryland, and 
New Jersey that trial courts should rarely meet with parties to 
discuss settlement when counsel is not present.11  While there 
may be cases in which doing so is appropriate due to special 
circumstances, in those cases, the judge must ensure counsel for 
both parties have consented to the ex parte communications, and 
the judge speaking to the parties should not preside over the 
trial.  See Kamaunu, 99 Hawai‘ i at 508, 57 P.3d at 432.   
The family court’s actions here are especially 
concerning because it apparently called the parties into 
chambers in the middle of a bench trial to address overnight 
visits, which had been one of the central issues to be resolved 
at the hearing.  Whether a court’s specific recommendation for a 
settlement is coercive is a fact-specific inquiry that depends 
                         
11   According to one survey, these views are shared widely among 
attorneys and judges.  In a 1988 National Survey conducted by the American 
Judicature Society, only four percent of judges and five percent of attorneys 
believed a judge should speak personally with a represented party to persuade 
them to accept a settlement, and only five percent of judges and eight 
percent of attorneys felt a judge should suggest a particular settlement figure to the client.  James A. Wall, Jr. & Dale E. Rude, Judicial 
Involvement in Settlement: How Judges and Lawyers View It, 72 Judicature 175, 
177 (1988).

24 on the circumstances in each case.  Compare Rosenfield v. 
Vosper, 114 P.2d 29, 33 (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. 1941) (reversing 
judgment where trial court called parties into chambers and 
recommended a particular settlement during a bench trial) with 
Gardner v. Mobil Oil Co., 31 Cal. Rptr. 731, 734-35 (Cal. Dist. 
Ct. App. 1963) (distinguishing Rosenfield where court 
“tentative[ly]” inquired about settlement when plaintiff had not established a prima facie case after three days of trial); see 
also D.L. Spillman, Jr., Annotation, Propriety and Prejudicial 
Effect of Suggestion or Comments by Judge as to Compromise or 
Settlement of Civil Case, 6 A.L.R.3d 1457 (1966). 
In In re Marriage of Hitchcock, 265 N.W.2d 599 (Iowa 
1978), the Iowa Supreme Court invalidated a marital settlement 
agreement because the family court coerced wife into settling.  
After hearing a half-day of testimony in a contested divorce 
proceeding, the family court judge called the attorneys for the 
parties into chambers and told them “he thought they should get 
together and try to work out a settlement.”  Id. at 602.  The 
judge then met with both attorneys and their clients.  Although 
the parties disputed exactly what was said, wife’s attorney 
testified that the judge told wife, who had stayed home raising 
children during the marriage, that she was not entitled to any 
part of husband’s business, but would be entitled to alimony to 
maintain her standard of living.  Id.  The judge also told the  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
25 parties that “if they could not get it settled, he was ready to 
continue to hear the evidence.”  Id. at 603.  After about an 
hour-and-a-half of negotiations, the parties entered into a 
settlement.  Id. at 602.  Wife filed a motion to vacate the 
divorce decree and for a new trial a few days later.  Id. at 
605. 
The Iowa Supreme Court found that “the announcements 
and conduct of the trial judge at the noon recess relative to 
what he considered to be a just distribution of the assets of 
the parties actually induced [wife’s] manifestation of assent to the purported settlement.”  Id. at 605.  The court noted that 
wife’s only option was “to follow the judge’s suggestion and settle the matter in accordance therewith or proceed to try her 
case on its merits before a tribunal which had apparently 
prejudged the issue[.]”  Id. at 606.  Accordingly, the court 
remanded the case for retrial on the division of marital assets.  Id. at 607. 
By contrast, as we held in Mijo, “a judge who is 
conducting a settlement conference acts within the bounds of propriety when he or she offers his or her assessment of a case 
as he or she understands it and recommends a settlement.”  87 
Hawai‘i at 28, 950 P.2d at 1228 (alterations omitted).  Other 
jurisdictions have similarly held that encouraging parties to 
settle by “correctly stat[ing] the law as it existed at the time  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
26 of the hearing” is not coercive, Blejski v. Blejski, 480 S.E.2d 
462, 467 (S.C. Ct. App. 1997), nor is telling the parties, 
“[h]owever you want to put it, it seems to me both of you people are at risk here when I take a further look at this case,”  
Urlaub v. Urlaub, 348 N.W.2d 454, 455 (N.D. 1984). 
Here, the family court’s actions are more similar to 
the court in Hitchcock than in Mijo.  As in Hitchcock, the 
family court here was the factfinder and ultimate decision-maker.  265 N.W.2d at 606.  By contrast, in Mijo, the parties’ 
case was set for a jury trial, and therefore the court 
recommending settlement would not have been resolving the 
parties’ factual disputes.  87 Hawai‘ i at 21, 950 P.2d at 1221.   
Moreover, this was not a situation in which the family 
court suggested the parties settle prior to commencing the 
evidentiary hearing, see id., nor did the family court merely 
inquire about settlement during the lunch recess, see Gardner, 
31 Cal. Rptr. at 734-35.  According to Mother’s counsel, the 
family court “made it clear that he had concerns and suggested 
that the part[ies] attempt to settle the case using Mother’s 
Proposed Order.”  In a different pleading, Mother’s counsel 
explained that the parties “us[ed Mother’s] proposed Order . . . as directed by the Court.”  Father’s declaration — which was 
uncontested — stated that when the court met with Father alone, 
it “strongly recommended” Father to settle according to Mother’s  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
27 Proposed Order, and that Father agreed to the settlement 
“because [he] realized that the judge was adamant and, of 
course, that the decision was ultimately his[.]”  (Emphasis 
added.)  Thus, as in Hitchcock, Father was seemingly given a 
choice between agreeing to the family court’s settlement recommendation, with which he disagreed, or to “proceed to try 
[his] case on its merits before a tribunal which had apparently 
prejudged the issue[.]”  265 N.W.2d at 606.   
Under these circumstances, we conclude that the family 
court committed plain error in speaking to the parties in chambers alone without the consent of counsel on the record, and 
by initiating settlement discussions and suggesting specific 
settlement terms about a heavily-contested issue in the middle 
of the trial during which it was the factfinder.   
Trial courts should ensure there is documentation that 
counsel has consented to any ex parte communications between the 
court and a party in furtherance of settlement.  We recognize 
that not all settlement conferences will be on the record, and 
therefore we do not create a per se rule that counsel must always consent on the record.  However, because the settlement 
negotiations here took place in the courtroom, and proceedings 
were on the record both before and after the negotiations,  
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
28 counsel’s consent could have easily been put on the record.

V. CONCLUSION 
Accordingly, we vacate the ICA’s November 25, 2019 
judgment on appeal, and the family court’s April 4, 2018 order 
denying motion for reconsideration to alter or to amend judgment 
or order for relief from judgment or order, and February 15, 
2018 stipulated order in its entirety, and remand this case to 
the family court for further proceedings consistent with this 
opinion.   Richard E. Mitchell

12   Father also argues in his application for writ of certiorari that 
the family court violated due process by “fail[ing] to ask petitioner or 
respondent in open court whether they understood and agreed with the 
settlement terms that had  been placed on the record, if they had any 
questions about it, or if anyone was forcing, pressuring or threatening 
either [party] into settling.”  We agree with the ICA that family courts need 
not conduct such a colloquy to ensure settlement is voluntary, when both 
parties are represented by counsel and agree to the terms of the settlement.
