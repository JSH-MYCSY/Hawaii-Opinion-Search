 (continued . . .) association that brought suit in Nationstar Mortg., LLC v. AOAO,
No. SCWC-18-0000475, 2023 WL 2519855 (Haw. Mar. 15, 2023).  The 
facts of this case are similar to Nationstar.  AOAO foreclosed 
on the previous owners of a condominium based on delinquent 
assessments.   Then, the mortgage lender, PHH Mortgage 
Corporation (PHH), foreclosed on AOAO.  AOAO argues that it 
remained entitled to exclusive possession and rents after the 
entry of summary judgment and an interlocutory decree of 
foreclosure, and prior to the confirmation of sale, and that the
circuit court therefore erred when it appointed a commissioner to collect rents.   2 
 
For the reasons given in Nationstar, we hold that AOAO 
was not entitled to possession of the condominium or rents 
during the period between summary judgment and confirmation of 
sale.  See id. at *5.  In general, an association may be 
entitled to some or all rental proceeds collected during this 
period, as specified by Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes (HRS)           
§ 514B-146(n) (Supp. 2015).3  Id. at *10.  However, in this case, 
                                                 
 2  The Honorable Henry T. Nakamoto and the Honorable Robert D.S. Kim 
presided.  The Honorable Ronald Ibarra presided over the proceedings on PHH’s 
first summary judgment motion, which was withdrawn and is not the subject of 
this appeal.   
 
3  HRS § 514B-146(n) was numbered as HRS § 514B-146(k) before the 
statute was renumbered in 2018, and it is referred to as HRS § 514B-146(k) in 
the briefing.   See 2018 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 195, § 4 at 672.  Because there 
was no change to the substance of the statute, we refer to the current 
numbering, HRS § 514B-146(n), throughout.  See id. 
 ***NOT  FOR  PUBLICATION  IN WEST’S  HAWAI ‘I REPORTS  AND PACIFIC  REPORTER***

 the Commissioner did not collect any rents.  Because the ICA 
correctly held the circuit court did not err in ordering the 
Commissioner to take possession and collect rents, and there are 
no rents to allocate under HRS § 514B-146(n), we affirm.   
II. 
BACKGROUND 
On March 27, 2014, PHH filed a verified complaint in 
the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit against John C. Patterson and Fenny J.M. Patterson (the Pattersons) for foreclosure of 
their property.  PHH alleged it was entitled to foreclose on the 
                                                                                                                                                             
(continued . . .) 
 HRS § 514B-146(n) provides:  
 
After any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure 
proceeding in which the association acquires title to the 
unit, any excess rental income received by the association 
from the unit shall be paid to existing lien holders based 
on the priority of lien, and not on a pro rata basis, and 
shall be applied to the benefit of the unit owner.  For 
purposes of this subsection, excess rental income shall be any net income received by the association after a court 
has issued a final judgment de termining the priority of a 
senior mortgagee and after paying, crediting, or reimbursing the association or a third party for: 
(1) The lien for delinquent assessments pursuant to 
subsections (a) and (b); 
(2) Any maintenance fee delinquency against the unit; 
(3) Attorney’s fees and other collection costs 
related to the association’s foreclosure of the 
unit; or 
(4) Any costs incurred by the association for the rental, repair, maintenance, or rehabilitation 
of the unit while the association is in possession of the unit includ ing monthly 
association maintenance fees, management fees, real estate commissions, cleaning and repair 
expenses for the unit, and general excise taxes 
paid on rental income; 
provided that the lien for delinquent assessments under 
paragraph (1) shall be pa id, credited, or reimbursed first.

 property
 based on the Pattersons’ default on a note and mortgage 
that PHH held.  On May 29, 2014, AOAO filed its answer to the 
complaint and claimed an interest in the property based on 
having previously foreclosed on it.  On July 14, 2017, PHH filed 
a motion for summary judgment and requested that the court 
appoint a commissioner to sell the property and, after costs, 
award the amount owed to PHH.   
On February 28, 2018, the circuit court orally granted 
summary judgment in favor of PHH and explained: “[O]nce I appoint a commissioner[,] that person has equitable and legal 
title to the property, has the power to terminate the lease, 
. . . collect rents, and actually becomes the equitable and 
legal title owner of the property pending the sale.”  (Emphasis added.)  The circuit court, in its April 4, 2018 written order 
granting summary judgment in favor of PHH, then appointed a 
commissioner.  The circuit court ordered that the Commissioner “shall henceforth hold all equitable and legal title to the 
Mortgaged Property” and was authorized “to take possession of 
the Mortgaged Property, to rent the Mortgaged Property pending 
foreclosure, if appropriate, and to sell the Mortgaged 
Property.”  (Emphasis added.)   ***NOT  FOR  PUBLICATION  IN WEST’S  HAWAI ‘I REPORTS  AND PACIFIC  REPORTER***

 The
 Commissioner reported that although the property 
was occupied as of his initial inspection on April 9, 2018, on 
subsequent inspections on May 10 and 15, 2018, the property was 
vacant; the property managers informed the Commissioner that 
AOAO had been renting the unit out but the tenant had since 
vacated.  The circuit court approved the Commissioner’s report 
and granted PHH’s motion for confirmation of foreclosure sale on 
December 4, 2018.  Because the Commissioner reported that the 
property was vacant during the period between when the circuit court granted PHH’s motion for summary judgment and when it 
granted PHH’s motion for confirmation of foreclosure sale, and 
he did not report seeking a renter during that period, it is 
clear that the Commissioner did not collect any rental proceeds.   
On appeal, AOAO raised two points of error, arguing 
the circuit court erred when it: (1) ordered that AOAO’s 
possessory interest and right to collect rent from the subject property was extinguished upon entry of the foreclosure decree 
and summary judgment; and (2) vested the Commissioner with legal 
and equitable title to the foreclosed property prior to the 
confirmation of sale.  The ICA held that the circuit court did 
not abuse its discretion on either point.   ***NOT  FOR  PUBLICATION  IN WEST’S  HAWAI ‘I REPORTS  AND PACIFIC  REPORTER***  
 
6 
  First, the ICA held that “a judgment entered on a 
foreclosure decree is a final determination of a foreclosed 
party’s ownership interests.”  It concluded that the circuit 
court therefore did not err in ordering the Commissioner to take 
possession of the property, including the collection of rental 
proceeds.  Second, the ICA held that the circuit court had 
merely ordered that the Commissioner temporarily hold legal and 
equitable title to the property to carry out his function as Commissioner, not that title was vested in him.  The ICA further concluded based on its precedents that “even if the Foreclosure 
Decree could be construed as (erroneously) vesting title to the 
Property in the Commissioner, any such error was harmless.”
4  See 
Bank of N.Y. Mellon v. Larrua, 150 Hawaiʻ i 429, 443-44, 504 P.3d 
1017, 1031-32 (App. 2022); U.S. Bank Tr. v. Ass’n of Apartment 
Owners of Waikoloa Hills Condo., 150 Hawaiʻ i 573, 581-82, 506 
P.3d 869, 877-78 (App. 2022) (as amended).   
AOAO filed a timely application for certiorari arguing
that the ICA gravely erred by holding AOAO did not maintain a 
possessory interest in the foreclosed unit.  AOAO asserted 
functionally identical arguments as those it made before us in 
its briefing for Nationstar.  It argued that per HRS § 514B- 
                                                 
4  The ICA did not reach the question of whether HRS § 514B-146(n) 
entitled AOAO to collect rental proceeds after summary judgment but before 
confirmation of sale.   ***NOT  FOR  PUBLICATION  IN WEST’S  HAWAI ‘I REPORTS  AND PACIFIC  REPORTER***  
 
7 
 (continued . . .) 146(b) (Supp. 2015), it was entitled to maintain ownership of 
the property until after the foreclosure sale is confirmed.   
AOAO further argued that the legislative history and plain language of HRS § 514B-146(n) support its argument that it is 
entitled to possession and rent after summary judgment but prior
to confirmation of sale.  
 5
 
In response, PHH first argued that AOAO’s application 
was rendered moot by the fact that the commissioner never 
collected any rents.6  PHH then argued that, in any event, AOAO 
                                                 
5 HRS § 514B-146(b) provides in relevant part: 
 
Except as provided in subsection (j ), when the 
mortgagee of a mortgage of record or other purchaser of a 
unit obtains title to the unit as a result of foreclosure of 
the mortgage, the acquirer of title and the acquirer’s 
successors and assigns shall not be liable for the share of 
the common expenses or assessments by the association 
chargeable to the unit that became due prior to the 
acquisition of title to the unit by the acquirer.  The 
unpaid share of common expenses or assessments shall be 
deemed to be common expenses collectible from all of the 
unit owners, including the acquirer and the acquirer’s 
successors and assigns.  The mortgagee of record or other 
purchaser of the unit shall be deemed to acquire title and 
shall be required to pay the unit’s share of common expenses 
and assessments beginning: 
(1) Thirty-six days after the order confirming the 
sale to the purchaser has been filed with the court; 
(2) Sixty days after the hearing at which the court 
grants the motion to confirm the sale to the 
purchaser; 
(3) Thirty days after the  public sale in a 
nonjudicial power of sale foreclosure conducted 
pursuant to chapter 667; or 
(4) Upon the recording of the instrument of 
conveyance; 
whichever occurs first . . . . 
 
6  We disagree with PHH’s argument that the case was rendered moot 
by the fact that no rents were collected.  “A case is moot if it has ‘lost 
its character as a present, live controversy of the kind that must exist if 
[courts] are to avoid advisory opinions on abstract propositions of law.’”  ***NOT  FOR  PUBLICATION  IN WEST’S  HAWAI ‘I REPORTS  AND PACIFIC  REPORTER***

 was mistaken that it continued to have a possessory interest in 
the property after foreclosure.  Quoting MDG Supply, Inc. v. 
Diversified Invs., Inc., PHH argued that “[a] judgment of 
foreclosure of mortgage or other lien and sale of foreclosed 
property is final . . . on the ground that such judgment finally 
determines the merits of the controversy.”  51 Haw. 375, 380, 
463 P.2d 525, 528 (1969).  PHH also argued that nothing in HRS  
§ 514B-146 alters the propriety of appointing a commissioner to 
take possession of a property, which is a well-established equitable remedy.   
III. DISCUSSION 
The legal question raised by AOAO in this case is 
identical to the question we answered in Nationstar.  Nationstar 
held that AOAO was not entitled to maintain possession of a unit 
and collect rents from the unit during the period after summary 
judgment of foreclosure and before confirmation of sale.  Nationstar, 2023 WL 2519855 at *5.  The same holding applies 
here.     
                                                                                                                                                             
(continued . . .) 
Kona Old Hawaiian Trails Grp. v. Lyman, 69 Haw. 81, 87, 734 P.2d 161, 165 
(1987) (alteration in original) (quoting Hall v. Beals, 396 U.S. 45, 48 
(1969)).  AOAO claimed an entitlement to both possession and rents, and in 
the alternative, it requested that the court award it common expense 
assessments as a matter of equity.  Thus, although no rents had been 
collected, other aspects of the controversy were present and live at the time 
of application.   ***NOT  FOR  PUBLICATION  IN WEST’S  HAWAI ‘I REPORTS  AND PACIFIC  REPORTER***

 In Nationstar, we explained that AOAO does not 
maintain a possessory interest in the property after summary 
judgment of foreclosure - its right to possession is terminated 
by the foreclosure judgment, and the circuit court has the 
equitable power to appoint a commissioner to preserve the value 
of the property in advance of sale.  Id. at *6-7.  This is 
because a “‘judgment of foreclosure . . . is final, although it contains a direction to commissioners to make a report of sale 
and to bring the proceeds into court for an order regarding their disposition.’”  Id. at *6 (quoting MDG Supply, 51 Haw. at 
380, 463 P.2d at 528).   
AOAO’s arguments to the contrary are unavailing.  “HRS 
§ 514B-146(b) establishes when a mortgagee or other purchaser must begin paying common expenses and assessments; it does not 
address the propriety of appointing a commissioner to take 
possession of the property and facilitate the foreclosure sale after the prior owner’s interest has been deemed foreclosed.”  
Id. at *6 (citing Larrua, 150 Hawaiʻ i at 441-42, 504 P.3d at 
1029-30).7   
                                                 
7  Nationstar also held that while a prior owner’s possessory 
interest and right to collect rent is extinguished upon a decree of 
foreclosure, HRS § 514B-146(n) carves out an exception that “entitles 
associations to continue receiving rent after a subsequent mortgage 
foreclosure, even if a commissioner is appointed, subject to paying any rent 
received in excess of the total amount of the reimbursements enumerated in 
HRS § 514B-146(n)(1)- (4) over to the lienholders in order of priority.”  Id. 
at *5.  Since there were no rents collected in this case, there is no need to 
apply HRS § 514B-146(n) here.   ***NOT  FOR  PUBLICATION  IN WEST’S  HAWAI ‘I REPORTS  AND PACIFIC  REPORTER***
