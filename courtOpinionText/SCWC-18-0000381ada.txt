tution ensure that an 
individual’s legitimate expectations of privacy will not be 
subjected to unreasonable governmental intrusions.”  State v. 
Meyer, 78 Hawai ʻi 308, 311 -12, 893 P.2d 159, 162- 63 (1995).  
“Every householder, the good and the bad, the guilty and the 
innocent, is entitled to the protection designed to secure the 
common interest against unlawful invasion of the house.”  Miller 
v. United States, 357 U.S. 301, 313 (1958).  To safeguard this 
constitutional guarantee, “[t]he standards by which any 
governmental search is to be judged is always its 
reasonableness[.]”  State v. Garcia , 77 Hawaiʻi 461, 467, 887 
P.2d 671, 677 (App. 1995) (quoting State v. Martinez, 59 Haw. 
366, 368, 580 P.2d 1282, 1284 (1978)).  More specifically, when 
the police demand entrance to a person’s hom e pursuant to a 
search warrant, they are constitutionally required to afford the 
occupants of the home a “reasonable time ” to respond before 
forcing entry.  State v. Monay, 85 Hawaiʻ i 282, 284, 943 P.2d 
908, 910 (1997) (quoting Garcia , 77 Hawaiʻi at 468, 887 Hawaiʻi 
at 678).    
  In this case, we consider whether the Honolulu Police 
Department (“HPD”) gave Petitioner/Defendant- Appellee Dawn 
Naeole (“Naeole”) a reasonable amount of time to respond to 
their demand for entry when they executed a search warrant at 
her home in the early morning of September 4, 2015.  Naeole, who *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
3 was suspected of illegal drug activity, had the front door of 
her 900 square foot home
 broken down at approximately 6:15 a.m. 
after the police knocked, announced their presence, and demanded 
entry four times within the span of twenty- five seconds.  A 
police officer heard a female voice inside the house after the 
third “knock-and -announce,” but the HPD officers had no reason 
to believe that Naeole was fleeing or that any evidence was 
being destroyed.  Under these circumstances, we hold that the 
amount of time afforded to Naeole to respond to the demand for 
entry was not reasonable, and thus vacate the Intermediate Court 
of Appeals’ (“ICA”)  opinion to the contrary.  
I.  BACKGROUND 
 
On September 4, 2015,  HPD officers executed a search 
warrant at the home of Naeole, seizing “approximately 952.483 
grams of a substance resembling methamphetamine, a medicine 
bottle containing 55 Loraz[e]pam tablets, a medicine bottle 
containing 79 Tramad[]ol tablets, 17.34 grams of marijuana, 
various purported paraphernalia and United St ates currency.”   On 
December 27, 2016, Naeole was charged by indictment in the 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit (“circuit court” ) with one 
count of promoting a dangerous drug in the first degree, in 
violation of Hawai ʻi Revised Statu
tes  
(“HRS”) § 712-12 41(1)(a)(i) (Supp. 2016), two counts of 
promoting a harmful drug in the second degree, in violation of *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
4 HRS § 712-1245(1)(a) (2014), 
one count of promoting a 
detrimental drug in the third degree, in violation of HRS § 712-
1249 (2014), and one count of possessing drug paraphernalia, in 
violation of HRS § 329
-43.5(a) (Supp. 2016).   Prior to trial, 
Naeole filed a motion to suppress all evidence obtained as a  
result of the execution of the search warrant.  Her motion 
claimed that HPD’s  execution of the warrant violated HRS § 803-
371 and article I, section 7 of the Constitution of the State of 
Hawai‘i.2  Hearings were held on Naeole’s motion to suppress on 
January 16 and March 6, 2018.3   
  During the hearings, HPD Officer Stephen Roe (“ Officer 
Roe”) testified that sixteen police officers accompanied by a 
supervisor executed the search warrant at Naeole’s home.  The 
                     
1 HRS § 803 -37 (Supp. 2017) provides in part:  
 
The officer charged with the warrant, if a house, store, or other 
building is designated as the place to be searched, may enter it 
without demanding permission if the officer finds it open.  If 
the doors are shut, the of ficer shall declare the officer’s 
office and the officer’ s business and demand entrance.   If the 
doors, gates, or other bars to the entrance are not immediately 
opened, the officer may break them.   
 
2 Article I, section 7 of the Constitution of the State of Hawaiʻ i 
provides: 
 
The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, 
papers and effects against unreasonable searches, seizures and 
invasions of privacy shall not be violated; and no warrants shall 
issue but upon  probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, 
and particularly describing the place to be searched and the 
persons or things to be seized or the communications sought to be 
intercepted.  
 
3 The Honorable Rom A. Trader presided.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
5 officers were attired in “green [battle dress uniforms], top and 
bottom, a load-bearing plate carrier, exterior body armor, a 
ballistic helmet” and carrying “either [an] M4 [rifle] and a 
sidearm, Glock 21, or just a Glock 21, depending on [their] 
role.”  
They arrived at approximately 6:00 a.m.4  The “perimeter 
team” secured the exterior of the home, while the “entry team” 
“stack[ed] up or form[ed] a stick in front of the residence 
along the wall[.]”  Officer Roe, who was in the entry team,  was 
instructed by his supervisor to initiate the “knock -and-announce 
procedure[.] ”  He conducted  the procedure, which consists  of 
three knocks and an announcement, four times.  During the 
hearings, Officer Roe demonstrated the four knock-and -announce 
procedures for the court:  “And it’s basically like this:  
(Knocks.)  Police.  We have a search warrant.  Open the door 
now.  (Knocks.)  Police.  We have a search warrant.  Open the 
door now.  (Knocks.)  Police.  We have a search warrant.  Open 
the door now.  (Knocks.)  Police.  We have a search warrant.  
Open the door now.”  
  
Officer Roe testified that there was no response from 
within Naeole’s home after the first two knock- and-announce 
procedures, but that after the third, he heard a female voice 
                     
4 The search warrant provided that it could be served between 6:00 
a.m. and 10:00 p.m. on or before September 4, 2015.  The circuit court found 
that the warrant was executed at about 6:15 a.m.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
6 coming from inside.  The voice seemed like it was directed at 
the officers, but he could not make out the words.  He conducted  
a fourth knock- and-announce proced ure, but there was no 
response.  After the fourth knock- and-announce procedure, the 
officers on the entry team were instructed by their supervisor 
to breach the front door. 
  Naeole testified during the hearings that she had just 
woken up and was right by the  hallway, heading to ward the 
bathroom, when she heard banging and then saw  police officers 
enter her home.  She testified that she didn’t hear any repeated 
knocking, any announcement that there were police officers at 
the door, or any request or demand to open the door.  She 
testified that, after they were already in her house, the 
officers told her they had a search warrant, but that they 
refused to show her the warrant.  She testified that her home is 
about 900 square feet in size.  
  Naeole’s neighbor , Zachariah Wentling, also testified 
during the hearings.  He testified that he came out his front 
door when he heard his dogs barking, saw police officers 
“wrestling with” or “messing with” Naeole’s front gate, ran back 
into his house to grab his phone, and, when he came back out, 
saw the officers break down Naeole’s front door.  He testified 
that when he came back outside, he saw the officers  bang on the 
door, say , “This is the police[,]” and then, without waiting for *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
7 a response, brake down the door.  A  video he recorded on his 
phone which showed the officers breaking down the front door of 
Naeole’s home was entered into evidence at the hearings.  
 
 The circuit court granted Naeole’s motion to suppress 
and ordered that all evidence seized as a result of the 
execution of the search warrant would be inadmissible at trial.  
The court found that Officer Roe’s testimony was “credible and 
compelling[,]” and  that, based on his in- court demonstration, 
the four knock- and-announce procedures took place “in a span of 
about twenty-five seconds” with “no discernable pause”  between 
each one.  The court also found that the officers “heard voices” 
after the third knock- and-announce procedure, but that “there 
was no evidence that the occupants were aware of the police 
presence and were taking steps to destroy any evidence, that 
would justified [sic] breaching the door based on exigent 
circumstances.”  It concluded that, although HPD had complied 
with the requirements of HRS § 803- 37, its execution of the 
search warrant violate d Naeole’s right against unreasonable 
searches and seizures under a rticle I, s ection 7 of the Hawaiʻi 
Constitution. 
 
 The State appealed the cir cuit court’s order to the 
ICA.  The ICA vacated the circuit court’s order, holding that, 
“[u]nder the circumstan ces of this case, . . . Naeole was 
afforded a reasonable amount of time to respond  to HPD’s demand *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
8 for entry to serve the search warrant.”  State v. Naeole, No. 
CAAP-18-0000381, 2019 WL 2067113, at *4 (App. May 10, 2019) 
(mem.).  Naeole filed an application for writ of certiorari with 
this court, which was granted. 
II.  STANDARD  OF REVIEW 
  “The appellate court reviews a circuit court’s ruling 
on a motion to suppress de novo  to determine whether the ruling 
was right or wrong.”  State v. Williams, 114 Hawai ʻi 406, 409, 
163 P.3d 1143, 1146 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted) 
(quoting State v. Kauhi, 86 Hawaiʻ i 195, 197, 948 P.2d 1036, 1038 
(1997)).   
III.  DISCUSSION 
  The “knock -and-announce” procedure is not a mere 
formality or police tactic ; it is a n essential restraint on the 
power of the State which has deep roots in both the Anglo-
American and Hawaiian legal systems .  See Miller, 357 U.S. at 
313 (“The requirement of prior notice of authority and purpose 
before forcing entry into a home is deeply rooted in our 
heritage and should not be given grudging application.”); 
Garcia, 77 Hawai ʻi at 465, 887 P.2d at 675 (tracing the modern 
knock-and-announce statute back to the 1869 Penal Code of the 
Hawaiian Kingdom and 
The King v. A h Lou You, 3 Haw. 393 (1872)).  
“The search warrant serves to protect individuals’ 
constitutional right to be ‘secure in their persons, houses, *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
9 papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures. 
. . .’”  State v. Diaz, 100 Hawai ʻi 210, 218, 58 P.3d 1257, 1265 
(2002) (quoting  Hawaiʻi Const. art. I, § 7).  The purpose of the 
search and seizure provision of the Hawaiʻi constitution, and the 
fourth amendment to the United States Constitution, is to 
“safeguard individuals from the arbitrary, oppressive, and  
harassing conduct of government officials.”  Id. at 217- 18, 220, 
58 P.3d at 1264-65, 1267 .  The knock- and-announce rule is one 
mechanism that protects this right.  Id.   Its purpose is to give 
the “person time to respond, avoid violence and protect privacy 
as much as possible. ”  State v. Quesnel, 79 Hawaiʻi 185, 191, 900 
P.2d 182, 188 (App. 1995)(citing Garcia, 77 Hawaiʻi at 468, 887 
P.2d at 678).  
HRS § 803- 37 defines the knock- and-announce rule and 
outlines the powers of a police officer charged with the 
execution of a search warrant.  The statute is intended to “(1) 
reduce the potential of violence to both occupants and police 
resulting from an unannounced entry; (2) prevent unnecessary 
property damage; and (3) protect the occupant’s right of 
privacy.”  State v. Dixon, 83 Hawai ʻi 13, 14, 924 P
.2d 181, 182 
(1996).  Compliance with the statute decreases the potential for 
violence and unnecessary property damage.  State v. Harada, 98 
Hawaiʻi 18, 28, 41 P.3d 174, 184 (2002).  If the officer charged *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
10 with execution of a search warrant 
finds that the doors of the 
place to be searched are shut, the statute requires “three steps 
. . . before the officer may physically break into the place to 
be searched—that the officer state his or her office, that he or 
she state his or her business, and that he or she demand 
entrance.”  
Garcia, 77 Hawai
ʻi at 465, 887 P.2d at 675.  The 
third step requires the officer to “expressly demand 
entrance[.]”  Monay, 85 Hawaiʻ i at  284, 943 P.3d at 910.  
“[O]rally communicat[ing]” a demand for entry “in the same way 
the police announce their office and purpose” constitutes such 
an express demand.  Garcia, 77 Hawaiʻi at 466, 887 P.2d at 676.  
In the present case, no party challenges the circuit court’s 
conclusion that HPD complied with the statutory requirements of 
HRS § 803-37.   
  What is at issue in this case is whether HPD gave 
Naeole or any other occupants of her home a reasonable amount of 
time to respond to their demand for entry.  HRS § 803-37 
provides that an officer executing a search warrant may break 
“the doors, gates, or other bars to the entrance” if they “are 
not immediately opened[.] ”  (Emphasis added) .  However, we have 
held that a literal construction of the term “immediately”  would 
contravene the constitutional right to be free of unreasonable 
searches, seizures, and invasions of privacy.  Monay, 85 Hawaiʻi 
at 284, 943 P.2d at 910; see  Garcia, 77 Hawaiʻi at 467, 887 P.2d *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
11 at 677 
(“The protection against unreasonable searches would mean 
very little if the police, armed with a search warrant, were 
authorized to break down the door of someone’s premises unless 
there was an ‘instant’ response.”) ; Haw. Const. art. I, § 7.  
Thus, we have held that, “absent the existence of exigent 
circumstances, police must afford occupants of a place to be 
searched a ‘reasonable time’ to respond to an announcement 
before forcing entry.”  Monay, 85 Hawai ʻi at 284, 943 P.2d at 910 
(quoting Garcia, 77 Hawaiʻi at 468, 887 P.2d at 678).  Allowing a  
reasonable time to respond gives an occupant “sufficient 
opportunity to respond to authority” and “to surrender his or 
her privacy voluntarily ” “before a forcible entry is made.”   
Garcia, 77 Hawaiʻ i at 467, 887 P.2d at 677 (citations and 
brackets omitted).  Without it, the request for entry is 
meaningless.  Quesnel, 79 Hawai
ʻi at 190, 900 P.2d at 187. 
  “[W]hat would constitute a reasonable period of time 
to respond to a knock and announcement must be determined by the 
circumstances of each case.”  Monay, 85 Hawaiʻi at 284, 943 P.2d 
at 910 (quoting Garcia, 77 Hawai ʻi at 468, 887 P.2d at 678).  
Pursuant to our constitution, we have not  adopted a general or 
“bright-line” rule for what consti tutes a reasonable amount of 
time in all cases, or even in a subset of cases, as is urged by 
the parties in this case.  Rather, our appellate courts have 
appropriately determined what constitutes a reasonable period of *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
12 time by considering the totality of the circumstances in each 
individual case.  
Cf. United States v. Banks, 540 U.S. 31, 36 
(2003) (“[W]e have treated reasonableness as a function of the 
facts of cases so various that no template is likely to produce 
sounder results than examining the totality of the circumstances 
in a given case; it is too hard to invent categories without 
giving short shrift to details that turn out to be important in 
a given instance, and without inflating marginal ones.”).  
  In Garcia, poli ce officers executed a search warrant 
at a small apartment unit at 7:07 p.m.  77 Hawai ʻi 
at 464, 464 
n.1, 887 P.3d at 674, 674 n.1.  A police officer knocked on the 
door of the apartment and announced, “Police, search warrant.”  
Id. at 464, 887 P.2d at 674.  The officer could hear voices 
inside, which he believed to be either people talking or voices  
from a television, but no one responded to his knock- and-
announce.  Id.  The officer then pulled open the locked exterior 
screen door of the apartment and ordered another officer to kick 
open the interior wooden door.  Id.   “Approximately ten (10) 
seconds elapsed from the time [the officer] knocked and 
announced to the time forcible entry was made into the . . . 
apartment.”  Id.  The ICA reversed the circuit cou rt’s denial of 
the defendant’s motion to suppress, holding that allowing the *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
13 occupants of the apartment less than ten seconds to respond was 
“constitutionally unreasonable.”5  Id. at 469, 887 P.2d at 679.   
  Six months after deciding Garcia , the ICA issued a 
similar opinion in State v. Quesnel, 79 Hawaiʻi 185, 900 P.2d 
182.  In Quesnel, police officers executed a search warrant at 
the defendants’ home at approximately 6:45 p.m.  Id. at 188, 900 
P.2d at 185.  An officer pounded on the door and yelled, 
“Police.  Search warrant[,]” and then kicked in the door when no 
one answered.  Id.  The circuit court found that the entire 
process, from the knock to the entry, lasted approximately ten 
seconds, and that the police “counted ‘one, two, three’” between 
making the announcement and kicking open the door, although 
there was conflicting evidence suggesting that as many as five 
seconds may have elapsed between the announcement and the forced 
entry.  Id. at 189-90 , 900 P.2d at 186- 87.  The ICA reversed the 
circuit court’s denial of the defendants’ motion to suppress, 
holding that, whether it was three or five seconds, the amount 
of time to respond was not reasonable.6  Id. at 190, 900 P.2d at 
187.   
                     
5 The ICA also held, in the alternative, that the evidence had to 
be suppressed because the officer did not make an express demand for entry, 
in violation of HRS § 803 -37 (1985).  Garcia, 77 Hawaiʻ i at 466, 887 P.2d at 
676.   
6 As in Garcia, the ICA also held that the evidence had to be 
suppressed because the officer did not make an express demand for entry, in 
violation of HRS § 803 -37 (1985).  Quesnel, 79 Hawaiʻi at 189-90, 900 P.2d at 
186-87.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
14   In Monay, police officers executed a search warrant at 
an apartment at 11:05 a.m.  85 Hawaiʻi at 283, 943 P.2d at 909.  
Officers approached the closed front door of the apartment and 
an officer “knocked on the door and announced, ‘ police, search 
warrant,’ but did not expressly demand entrance.  The officers 
heard no suspicious sound or movement inside the apartment.  
Within two seconds of the announcement, [the officer] opened the 
unlocked door, and the officers entered the apartment. ”  Id.  
This court, embracing the reasoning of Garcia, reversed the 
circuit court’s denial of the defendants’ m otion to suppress, 
holding that “the forced entry by police two seconds after the 
knock and announcement was constitutionally insufficient to give 
the occupants a reasonable opportunity to respond .”7  Id. at 285, 
943 P.2d at 911. 
  In State v. Diaz, police officers executed a search 
warrant at a video store at approximately 6:45 p.m., during the 
store’s regular business hours.  100 Hawaiʻi at 213, 58 P.3d at  
1260.  Upon entering the store, a detective asked a customer if 
a door on the makai side of the store was an office door.  Id.   
After the detective received an affirmative response, an officer 
knocked three times 
on the office door and stated,  “[P]olice 
                     
7 We also held, in the alternative, that the evidence had to be 
suppressed because the officer did not make an express demand for entry, in 
violation of HRS § 803 -37 (1993).  Monay, 85 Hawai ʻi at 284, 943 P.2d at 910.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
15 department, search warrant[,]” but there was no response.  Id.  
After waiting approximately fifteen seconds, the officer was 
instructed to break the door, which he did by kicking it in.  
Id.  Although this court held that HRS § 803- 37 (1993) is  
inapplicable to a search of the interior office of a commercial 
establishment that is open for business, we nevertheless held 
that a reasonable expectation of privacy did exist and that the 
police were required to give the defendant a reasonable amount 
of time to respond.  Id. at 219-21, 58 P.3d at 1266- 68.  
However, we upheld that circuit court’s denial of the 
defendant’s motion to suppress, holding that, “[u]nder the 
circumstances of this case, expecting the occupant of the 
interior office to be alert and responsive during business hours 
is reasonable[,]” and that forced entry after fifteen seconds 
was thus constitutional.  Id.  at 221, 58 P.3d at 1268.   
  Considering the totality of the circumstances in the 
present case, we conclude that the amount of time HPD gave the 
occupants of Naeole’s home to respond to their requests for 
entry was not reasonable.  The circuit court found that Officer 
Roe conducted the knock- and-announce procedure four times within 
the span of about twenty -five seconds without any discernable 
pause between each one.  This is not a reasonable amount of time 
to expect the occupant of a modestly- sized home to respond to an 
early morning demand for entry.  At the time HPD executed the *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
16 search warrant, most
 people would be expected to be asleep, just 
waking up, or otherwise indisposed by the customary  activities 
of the early morning, such as showering, getting dressed, or 
eating breakfast.8  In other words , it was not reasonable to 
expect the occupants of Naeole’s home to be “alert and 
responsive” during the early morning hours.  Id.   Furthermore, 
Officer Roe did not “discernabl[y] pause” between each knock -
and-announce procedure, even after hearing a voice that may have 
been directed at the HPD officers.  Not  pausing between 
announcements and not allowing additional time to respond after 
hearing a voice from inside the home would have made it 
difficult for an occupant of the home to indicate compliance and 
voluntarily submit to the officers’ authority .  We note that 
there was no evidence that the search of Na eole’s home presented 
a risk to officer safety.  W e hold that giving an occupant only 
                     
8 Our analysis need not take into account  Naeole’s testimony that 
she was actually awake at the time HPD breached her front door.  “[U]nder 
article 1, section 7 of our constitution, the focus is on whether the 
officer’s actions are constitutionally reasonable.”  Diaz, 100 Hawai ʻi at 230, 
58 P.3d at 1277 (emphasis added); see Garcia, 77 Hawaiʻ i at 467, 887 P.2d at 
671 (“[T]he constitution mandates that police conduct  in executing a search 
warrant must be reasonable .” (emphasis added)).  T hus, “the facts known to 
the police are what count in judging reasonable waiting time [.]”  Banks, 540 
U.S. at 39.  There is no evidence in the record that the police knew that any 
occupant of Naeole’s home  was awake and active  when the first demand for 
entry was made.  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
17 twenty-five seconds to respond at 
such an early morning hour is 
unreasonable.9 
  In fact , there were no exigent circumstances that 
would have justified breaching the door earlier than would have 
otherwise been reasonable.  Exigent circumstances are those 
under which “the demands of the occasion reasonably call for an 
immediate police response. ”  State v. Lloyd , 61 Haw. 505, 512, 
606 P.2d 913, 918 (1980).  Such circumstances exist where there 
is an imminent threat of harm to a person, where there is a 
danger of serious property damage, where a suspect is likely to 
escape, or where evidence is likely to be removed or destroyed. 
 
Id.  “Since drugs are by their nature easily destroyed or 
secreted,” exigent circumstances in cases involving searches for 
drugs “exist when the facts show that the occupants of the 
suspected locale are aware of the police presence and are taking 
steps which the police realistically fear may lead to 
destruction of the contraband.”  State v. Davenport , 55 Haw. 90, 
99, 516 P.2d 65, 71- 72 (1973) ; see Lloyd, 61 Haw. at 512- 13, 606 
P.2d at 918-19 (sounds of “scurrying” and “crashing” within the 
house that might have indicated that a suspect was fleeing or 
                     
9  Our opinion should not be construed to express any position as to 
whether a time period greater or less than 25 seconds at a later time of the 
day or based on different circumstances would be a reasonable amount of time 
to respond to a knock -and-announce procedure, as what constitutes a 
reasonable period of time must be determined by the circumstances of each 
case. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

that evidence was being removed or destroyed constituted exigent 
circumstances); cf. Quesnel , 79 Hawai ʻi at 191, 900 P.2d at 188 
(“The State did not submit any evidence that the police, after 
knocking and announcing, heard frantic movement or flushing 
toilets or other signals that the occupants were attempting to 
destroy or hide evidence.”) .  However, the mere fact that drugs 
are involved in a case, and that drugs are generally easy to 
remove, hide, or destroy,  does not introduce exigent 
circumstances into all drug- related cases.  State v. Dorson, 62 
Haw. 377, 385, 615 P.2d 740, 746 (1980).  In this case, although 
the search was for evidence of drug offenses, there were no 
exigent circumstances, and thus, the occupants of Naeole’s home 
were entitled to a reasonable opportunity to respond. 
IV.  CONCLUSION 
  For the foregoing reasons, the ICA’s memorandum 
opinion and judgment on appeal are vacated , the circuit court’s 
order granting Naeole’s motion to suppress is affirmed , and the 
case is remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings 
consistent with this opinion.
