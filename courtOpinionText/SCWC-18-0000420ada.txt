2 At trial, Dison and several Honolulu Police Department 
(HPD) officers testified ; Manuel did not .  At the close of 
trial, the circuit court instructed the jur y on assault in the 
second and third degree s.  The circui t court also gave the jury 
an assault in the third degree by mutual affray (Mutual Affray) 
instruction.  Neither party requested any other instruction.  
The jury convicted Manuel of second-degree assault. 
In his application for writ of certiorari , Manuel 
asserts tha t Reckless Endangering  in the Second Degree  is an 
included offense of assault in the second degree , and that there 
was a rational basis in the evidence to acquit him of assault in 
the secon d degree  and to convict him of reckless endangering in 
the second degree  instead.  Therefore, Manuel claims that the 
circuit court was required to instruct the jury on reckless 
endangering in the second degree . 
We agree.  Because we hold that reckless enda ngering 
in the second degree  is an included offense of assault in the 
second degree  and, under the circumstances of this case, there 
was a rational basis in the evidence to acquit Manuel of assault 
in the second degree and convict him of reckless endangeri ng in 
the second degree , the circuit court here was required to 
instruct the jury on second-degree reckless endangering  under 
Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) §  707-711(1)(d) .  We vacate the 
ICA’s Judgment on Appeal which affirmed Manuel’s Judgment of ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
3 Conviction and Sentence and remand to the circuit court for a 
new trial.  
I. BACKGROUND  
On October 16, 2017, the State charged Manuel with 
Assault in the Second Degree, in violation of HRS § 707-
711(1)(d).2   
A. Trial 
Trial began on February 27, 2018.3  During opening 
statements, the State asserted that Manuel had been drinking on 
the night of the  altercation , Manuel instigated the attack , and 
Dison did not fight back.   During the defense’s  opening 
statement, Manuel ’s attorney  presented the theory that Manuel 
was not gu ilty of second-degree assault because he acted in 
self-defense.   
1. Dison’s Testimony  
Dison testified that on the night of October 13, 2017, 
he was at Pier 38 preparing to leave on a fishing trip.  Dison 
explained that while he was walking to the fishing bo at, he saw 
                     
2 HRS § 707-711(1)(d)  (2015) provides,  
 
Assault in the second degree . (1) A person commits the 
offense of assault in the second degree if:  
 
. . . . 
 
(d) The person intentionally or knowingly causes bodily 
injury to another with a dangerous instrument[.]  
3  The Honorable Karen T. Nakaso ne presided.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
4 Manuel pass by on a bike.  Although Dison and Manuel were close 
at the time, Dison attempted to hide from Manuel because he 
wanted to get on the boat.  However, Manuel saw Dison and called 
him over.  
Instead of proceeding to the boat, Dison follo wed 
Manuel to a dark restroom area on the pier.  Although the area 
was dark, Dison stated that he saw Manuel had bloodshot eyes.  
Dison also claimed that Manuel slurred his speech and smelled of 
alcohol.  There, Manuel asked Dison , “why I do that[,]” to wh ich 
he responded “Did what?”  Dison explained that he did not know 
what Manuel was talking about and decided to leave.  However, as 
Dison tried to walk away, Manuel hit him on the head.  
After being hit in the head, Dison claimed that he 
turned around, saw Manuel open a folding knife with a three -inch 
blade, and heard the blade click into place.  Dison testified 
that Manuel then stabbed him in the left side of his chest.  
Dison claimed that after the stabbing, Manuel said , “That’s what 
you get,” and tried to  leave on his bike.  However, Dison ran 
after Manuel, grabbed the bike, and tried to pull it away from 
Manuel. 
Dison testified that he and Manuel struggled to gain 
control of the bike, during which time Manuel sliced Dison’s 
right arm with the knife.  Diso n claimed that he then let go of 
the bike and yelled for someone to call 911.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
5 During cross -examination, Dison asserted that he had 
not been drinking on the night of the incident.  Additionally, 
Dison admitted that he did not tell the detectives that he had  
heard the blade click into place or that Manuel told him , 
“That’s what you get.”  
2. Officer Darrin Lum’s Testimony  
HPD Officer Darrin Lum (Officer Lum) responded to the 
call at Pier 38.  Officer Lum testified that Dison was going in 
and out of consciousness,  and was not able to answer all of his 
questions.  Officer Lum believed Dison was intoxicated because 
he could smell an odor of alcohol emanating from Dison.4  Officer 
Lum observed Dison’s chest wound to be around 1.5 inches long 
and 0.5 inches wide.  Offi cer Lum stated that he did not see 
anyone else in the area.  
3. Officer Bryce H amamoto’s Testimony  
HPD Officer Bryce Hamamoto (Officer Hamamoto) arrived 
at the scene and noticed that Dison was bleeding and had 
injuries to his arm and a stab wound to his chest.   Dison 
appeared to be coherent but in a lot of pain.  Officer Hamamoto 
was assigned to search for suspects.  Officer Hamamoto 
eventually located Manuel near Kewalo Basin near a fishing boat 
                     
4  HPD Officer Jon Ishikawa (Officer Ishikawa) also responded to the call 
for assistance .  Officer Ishikawa testified that he believed Dison was 
intoxicated because his speech was slurred and his eyes were glassy.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
6 called “ Ping Tan.”  Officer Hamamoto observed that Manuel 
appeared to have been drinking.  
4. Officer Arllen Laufasa’s Testimony  
Officer Ar llen Laufasa (Officer Laufasa) was also 
present when the officers located Manuel on the night of the 
altercation .  Officer Laufasa  testified  that he searched Manuel  
and recovered a red r ag and a black folding knife from Manuel’s 
pocket.  The knife’s blade was three - to four-inches long and 
matched the description Dison had provided of the weapon used in 
the stabbing.  The State submitted  the knife into evidence as 
State’s Exhibit 29.  
5. Detective Eric Lalau ’s Testimony  
HPD Detective Eric Lalau (Detective Lalau)  was 
assigned to  investiga te the stabbing of Dison.  Detective Lalau 
met with Dison on the evening of the offense and obse rved that 
Dison had a golf -ball-size bump on the back of his he ad and 
wounds to his chest and right forearm.  Detective Lalau was 
unable to locate any witnesses besides Dison who could identify 
a suspect.  Detective Lalau testified that no surveillance video 
footage of the stabbing was recovered.  Detective Lalau stat ed 
that a knife with an approximately three -inch blade was 
recovered .  Detective Lalau explained that he did not order DNA 
testing for the knife because it did  not appear to have blood on ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
7 it, and that he was not able to conduct  fingerprint testing on 
the knife because it was taken from Manuel’s pocket.  
6. The Defense  
After the State rested, Manuel moved for judgment of 
acquittal, which the circuit court denied.  Manuel did not 
testify at trial  and did not call any witnesses to testify in 
his defense.  
B. Jury Inst ructions, Verdict, and Sentencing  
On February 28, 2018, the circuit c ourt and the 
parties met to settle a portion of the  jury instructions on the 
record.  Manuel’s attorney requested that the circuit court 
instruct the jury on assault in the third degree  under HRS  
§ 707-712(1)(a) and (b) .5  The State objected to instruction on 
any included  offense of assault in the second degree .  Although 
the circuit court itself proposed including an instruction on 
third-degree assault, it  deferred making a decision regarding 
whether to include an instruction on  assault in the third degree  
to “see what co mes out in the rest of the case .”  The circuit 
court additionally proposed instructing the jury on Mutual 
                     
5  HRS § 707-712(1) (2015) provides, 
 
Assault in the third degree . (1) A person commits the 
offense of assault in the third degree if the person:  
 
(a) Intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes bodily 
injury to another person; or  
(b) Negligently causes bodily injury to another person with  
a dangerous instrument.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
8 Affray under HRS §  707-712(2).6  Defense counsel agreed to the 
circuit court’s proposal s.  However, the State objected.  When 
the circuit court asked if either party wanted to propose any 
other instructions, neither party requested that the circuit 
court give a reckless endangering in the second degree  
instruction.  
The circuit court subsequently instruct ed the j ury on 
the offenses of assault in the second degree , assault in the 
third degree , and Mutual Affray . 
The assault in the second degree  instruction read,  
A person commits the offense of Assault in the Second 
Degree if he intentionally or knowingly causes bodily 
injury to another person with a dangerous instrument.  
 
There are three material elements of the offense of Assault 
in the Second Degree, each of which the prosecution must 
prove beyond a reasonable doubt.  
 
These three elements are:  
 
1. That, on or about October 13, 2017 in the City 
and County of Honolulu, the Defendant caused 
bodily injury to Lianel Dison; and  
 
2. That the Defendant did so with a dangerous 
instrument; and  
 
3. That the Defendant did so intentio nally or 
knowingly.  
The circuit court further instructed that “ ‘[b]odily injury ’ 
means physical pain, illness, or any impairment of physical 
                     
6  HRS § 707-712(2) ( 2015) provides,  
 
(2) Assault in the third degree is a misdemeanor 
unless committed in a fight or scuffle entered into by 
mutual consent, in which case it is a petty misdemeanor.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
9 condition [,]” and that “‘[s]erious bodily injury ’ means bodily 
injury which creates a substantial risk of death or which causes 
serious, permanent disfigurement, or protracted loss or 
impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ.”  
The circuit court also instructed the jury on assault 
in the third degree , HRS § 707-712(1)(b),  and Mutual Affray , 
HRS § 707-712(2).  The assault in the third degree  instruction 
read,  
A person commits the offense of Assault in the Third Degree 
if he negligently causes bodily injury to another person 
with a dangerous instrument.  
 
There are three material elements of the offense of Assault 
in the Third Degree, each of which the prosecution must 
prove beyond a reasonable doubt.  
 
These three elements are:  
 
1. That, on or about October 13, 2017 in the City 
and County of Honolulu, the Defendant caused 
bodily injury to Lianel Dison; and  
 
2. That the defendant did so with a dangerous 
instrument; and  
 
3. That the Defendant did so negligently.  
The instruction for Mutual Affray read,  
If you find that the prosecution has proven the offense of 
Assault in the Third Degree beyond a reasonable dou bt, then 
you must also consider whether the fight or scuffle was 
entered into by mutual consent, whether expressly or by 
conduct.  
 
You must determine whether the prosecution has proven 
beyond a reasonable doubt that the fight or scuffle was not 
entered int o by mutual consent.  This determination must be 
unambiguous and is to be indicated by answering ‘Yes’ or 
‘No’ on a special interrogatory that will be provided to 
you. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
10 On March 1, 2018, the jury found Manuel guilty of 
assault in the second degree .  On May 3, 2018, the circuit court 
sentenced Manuel to an indeterminate term of five years ’ 
incarceration . 
C. ICA Proceedings  
On May 18, 2018, Manuel filed a notice of appeal to 
the ICA.  In his opening brief to the ICA, Manuel argued that 
the circuit court erred whe n it failed to instruct the jury on 
the misdemeanor offense of reckless endangering in the second 
degree.  Manuel argued that second-degree reckless endangering  
is an included offense of second-degree assault, and that “there 
was a rational basis in the ev idence to acquit [Manuel] of 
assault in the second degree and convict him of reckless 
endangering in the second degree .”  Therefore, Manuel contended, 
the circuit court was required to instruct the jury on reckless 
endangering in the second degree . 
In its answering brief , the State  argued that second-
degree reckless endangering is not an included offense of 
assault in the second degree  because the conduct is not the 
same.  In particular, the State asserted that second-degree 
assault requires use of a danger ous instrument while reckless 
endangering in the second degree  does not.  Additionally, the 
State averred  that the result s of the charges are  not the same  
because second-degree assault requires bodily injury whereas ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
11 reckless endangering in the second degre e requires serious 
bodily injury or death.  The State further contended that even 
if reckless endangering in the second degree  is an included 
offense, there was no rational basis in the record for 
acquitting Manuel of second-degree assault and convicting h im of 
reckless endangering in the second degree .  The State argued 
that Manuel’s conduct was clearly intentional or knowing, so 
there was no evidence that Manuel had acted recklessly to 
support a conviction for second-degree reckless endangering .  
Manuel did not file a reply brief.  
The ICA entered a Summary Disposition Order on 
April 18, 2019.  The ICA affirmed the circuit court’s Judgment 
of Conviction and Sentence, and held that, pursuant to its 
holding in State v. Magbulos , 141 Hawaiʻi 483, 413 P.3d 387 (App. 
2018), there was “no reasonable possibility that the Circuit 
Court’s failure to instruct on the lower -level reckless 
endangering offense affected the outcome of this case.”  
The ICA therefore affirmed the circuit court’s 
Judgment of Conviction and Sen tence.  The ICA issued its 
Judgment on Appeal on May 20, 201 9. 
We hold that the ICA erred and remand this matter to 
the circuit court . ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
12 II. STANDARD OF REVIEW  
Whether an offense is an included offense of another 
is a question of law.  State v. Friedman , 93 Hawaiʻi 63, 68, 996 
P.2d 268, 273 (2000).  The appellate courts review questions of 
law de novo under the right/wrong standard of review.  Id. 
III.  DISCUSSION  
A. The circuit court erred in failing to instruct the jury on 
the elements of reckless endangering in the sec ond degree .  
Manuel argues that the circuit court should have sua 
sponte instructed the jury on reckless endangering in the second 
degree, which, he asserts, is a n included offense of assault in 
the second degree . 
This court has held that “jury instruction s on lesser -
included offenses must be given where there is a rational basis 
in the evidence for a verdict acquitting the defendant of the 
offense charged and convicting the defendant of the included 
offense.”  State v. Flores , 131 Hawaiʻi 43, 51, 314 P.3d 120, 129 
(2013) (citing State v. Stenger , 122 Hawaiʻi 271, 296, 226 P.3d 
441, 466 (2010)) .  However, this court does not notice errors 
that were not raised before the circuit court unless th is court 
determines that plain error has been committed and substantial 
rights have been affected thereby.  State v. Miller , 122 Hawaiʻi 
92, 100, 223 P.3d 157,  165 (2010).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
13 At trial, neither party requested that the circuit 
court instruct the jury on reckless endangering in the second 
degree.  Therefor e, despite the circuit court’s duty to instruct 
on included offenses, any error in failing to do so is still 
analyzed under plain error review.  See Miller, 122 Hawaiʻi at 
100, 223 P.3d at 165.  We review the circuit court’s failure to 
instruct the jury on  reckless endangering in the second degree  
for plain error because, as there was a rational basis in the 
evidence to acquit Manuel of assault in the second degree  and 
convict him of reckless endangering in the second degree , the 
circuit court’s fa ilure to instruct the jury on reckless 
endangering in the second degree  affected Manuel’s substantial 
rights.  Id.  
1. Reckless endangering in the second degree  is an 
included offense of assault in the second degree . 
Manuel argues that reckless endangering in the seco nd 
degree is an included offense of assault in the second degree .  
Manuel contends that, based on the statutory definitions of 
second-degree assault and reckless endangering in the second 
degree, “it is impossible to commit assault in the second degree 
based on intentionally or knowingly causing bodily injury 
without committing reckless endangering in the second degree.”  
HRS § 707-711(1)(d)  provides,  
(1) A person commits the offense of assault in the 
second degree if:  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
14 . . . .  
 
(d) The person intentionall y or knowingly causes 
bodily injury to another with a dangerous 
instrument[.]  
HRS § 707-714(1)(a)  (2015) provides,  
(1) A person commits the offense of reckless 
endangering in the second degree if the person:  
 
(a) Engages in conduct that recklessly places 
another person in danger of death or serious 
bodily injury[.]  
HRS § 701-109(4) (2015) provides that an offense is 
included in another offense when:  
(a) It is established by proof of the same or less than all 
the facts required to establish the commission o f the 
offense charged;  
 
(b) It consists of an attempt to commit the offense charged 
or to commit an offense otherwise included therein; or  
 
(c) It differs from the offense charged only in the respect 
that a less serious injury or risk of injury to the same  
person, property, or public interest or a different state 
of mind indicating lesser degree of culpability suffices to 
establish its commission.  
“[T]he general rule is that ‘an offense is included if 
it is impossible to commit the greater without also comm itting 
the lesser. ’”  Friedman , 93 Hawaiʻi at 72, 996 P.2d at 277  
(quoting State v. Burdett , 70 Haw. 85, 87 -88, 762 P.2d 164, 166 
(1988)).  Additionally, in applying HRS § 701-109(4)(a) , we have 
held that “several factors may be considered in determining 
whether an offense is a lesser included offense of another: 
(1) the degree of culpability; (2)  the legislative statutory 
scheme; and (3)  the end result.”  Friedman , 93 Hawaiʻi at 72, 996 
P.2d at 277 (citing State v. Alston , 75 Haw. 517, 533, 865 P.2d ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
15 157, 166 (1994)).   Based on the general rule , the three factors 
enunciated in Alston, and the fact that reckless endangering in 
the second degree  requires an intermediate degree of culpability 
between assault in the second degree  and the instructed offense 
of assault in the third degree , we hold that reckless 
endangering in the second degree , HRS § 707-714(1)(a), is a n 
included offense of assault in the second degree , HRS § 707-
711(1)(d).   
a. It is impossible to commit assault in the second
degree without also committing reckless 
endangering in the second degree.   
Under the general rule, second-degree reckless 
endangering appears to be a n included offense of assault in the 
second degree  because it is impossible to commit second-degree 
assault without also committing reckless endangering in the 
second degree .  See Friedman , 93 Hawaiʻi at 72, 996 P.2d at 277.  
First, the level of culpability required to commit assault in 
the second degree , intentionally or knowingly, subsumes the 
level of culpability required to commit reckless endangering in 
the second degree , recklessly.  See HRS § 702-208 (2015) (“When 
the law provides that recklessness is sufficient to establish an 
element of an offense, that element also is established if, with 
respect thereto, a person acts intentionally or knowingly.”).  
In other words, if a person acts knowingl y or intentionally, a 
state of mind element that requires recklessness is satisfied.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
16 Further, based upon the statutory definitions in HRS Chapter 
707, one cannot cause bodily injury with a dangerous instrument 
(assault in the second degree ) without placin g that person in 
danger of death or serious bodily injury ( reckless endangering 
in the second degree ).  HRS § 707-700 (2015) provides,  
“[d]angerous instrument ” means any firearm, whether loaded 
or not, and whether operable or not, or other weapon, 
device, instrument, material, or substance, whether animate 
or inanimate, which in the manner it is used or is intended 
to be used is known to be capable of producing  death or 
serious bodily injury.  
Therefore, although the statutory definitions of bodily injury7 
and serious bodily injury8 are different, the use of a dangerous 
instrument necessarily places the victim in danger of death or 
serious bodily injury.   Accordingly, reckless endangering in the 
second degree  is an included offense of assault in the second 
degree. 
b. The Alston factors indicate that reckless 
endangering in the second degree is an included 
offense of assault in the second degree. 
The factors set forth in Alston also indicate that 
second-degree reckless endangering is an included offense of 
assault in the second degree .  First, “[r]egarding the degree of 
culpability, the rule is that the lesser included offense cannot 
                     
7  HRS § 707-700 provides, “ ‘[b]odily injury ’ means physical pain, 
illness, or any impairment of physical condition.”  
 
8  HRS § 707-700 provides, “‘[s]erious bodily injury ’ means bodily injury 
which creates a substantial risk of death or which causes serious, permanent 
disfigurement, or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily 
member or organ. ” ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
17 have a mental state greater than or different from  that which is 
required for the charged offense.”  Alston, 75 Haw. at 534, 865 
P.2d at 166 (emphasis in original).  The Alston court explained 
that “different” means that the mental states intend a different 
result, not different levels of culpability.  See id. (holding 
that specific intent to cause another’s absence from an official 
proceeding  is different from intent to cause, or recklessness in 
causing, terror.).  In other words, the level of culpability 
(i.e., intentionally, knowingly,  recklessly, or negligently) of 
the lesser offense can be less than  that of the greater offense, 
but the intended result cannot be different.  Here, the mental 
states for both crimes require some level of intent that a 
person become injured by the criminal conduct, so the mental 
state is not impermissibly different under the Alston factors.  
Moreover, th e level of culpability for reckless endangering in 
the second degree , recklessness, is less than the level of 
culpability required for assault in the second degree , 
intentional or knowing.   HRS § 702-208 cmt.  Therefore, second-
degree reckless endangering does not have a mental state that is 
greater than or different from second-degree assault.  
Second, “[t]he legislative statutory scheme of both 
the greater and lesser offense should reflect a legislative 
intent to protect similar societal interests.”  Friedman, 93 
Hawaiʻi at 72, 996 P.2d at 277.  The classification of two crimes ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
18 under different penal chapters indicates the legislature’s 
intent to protect different societal interests and that one 
crime would not be the lesser -included of the other.  Burdett, 
70 Haw. at 89, 762 P.2d at 167.  While the inclusion of two 
crimes in the same penal chapter does not necessarily mean that 
one is the lesser -included offense of the other, see State v. 
Freeman, 70 Haw. 434,  437, 774 P.2d 888 , 890 (1989), it does 
indicate  that the legislature intended to protect similar 
societal interests.   See Burdett, 70 Haw.  at 89, 762 P.2d at 
167.  Here, the offenses of assault in the second degree  and 
reckless endangering in the second degree  are set forth in the 
same penal chapter  – HRS Chapter 707 “Offenses Against the 
Person.”  The forbidden end results, bodily injury to a person 
and placing a person in danger of serious bodily injury or 
death, contemplate protecting the same societal interest – 
preventing people from phy sically inj uring other people.  
Therefore, the legislative statutory scheme for both offenses 
reflects an intent to protect similar societal interests.  
Finally, the “lesser included offense should produce 
the same end result as the greater charged offense.”  Alston, 75 
Haw. at 535, 865 P.2d at 166 -67.  This factor weighs in favor of 
second-degree reckless endangering being an included offense of 
assault in the second degree  because both offenses result in  a 
person being placed in  danger of serious bodily injury or de ath.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
19 If a person is merely injured with a dangerous instrument 
(which, by definition, must be capable of producing death or 
serious injury), then the person was placed in danger of death 
of serious bodily injury.  In other words, b ut for some luck, 
the dangerous instrument could have - but did not - produce 
death or serious bodily injury.  T he end result of second-degree 
assault, then, is injury plus the accompanying danger of 
something worse.   Similarly, the end result of reckless 
endangering in the secon d degree  is that a person is placed in 
danger of death or serious bodily injury.    
c. Reckless endangering in the second degree is an 
included offense because it relies on an 
intermediate level of culpability between assault
in the second and third degrees.   
Additionally , it defies common sense to include 
assault in the third degree  as an included offense of second-
degree assault while excluding reckless endangering in the 
second degree .  The relevant distinction between assault in the 
second and third degrees  in the circuit court’s jury 
instructions  is the defendant’s level of culpability.  In order 
to convict Manuel for  second-degree assault, the jury was 
required to find that defendant “ intentionally or knowingly  
cause[d] bodily injury to another with a dang erous instrument.”  
HRS § 707-711(d) (emphasis added).  In order to convict Manuel 
for third-degree assault, by contrast, the jury was required to ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
20 find that defendant “ negligently  cause[d] bodily injury to 
another with a dangerous instrument.”  HRS §  707-712(b) 
(emphasis added).  Our penal code identifies four tiers of 
culpability.  HRS §  702-206 cmt.  In descending order, these 
tiers are intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, and negligently.  
HRS § 702-208 cmt.  A situation in which a defendant recklessly  
caused bodily injury to another with a dangerous instrument is 
therefore necessarily an intermediate between assault in the 
second and third degrees .  Thus, reckless endangering in the 
second degree , an offense in which a defendant recklessly causes 
bodily injury to another with a dangerous instrument, must 
constitute a n included crime of  second-degree assault. 
Second-degree reckless endangering is a lesser-
included offense of assault in the second degree .  Under the 
general rule, one cannot commit second-degree assault without 
also committing reckless endangering in the second degree .  
Further, the Alston factors are satisfied  because second-degree 
reckless endangering has the same mens rea but a lesser degree 
of culpability than assault in the second degre e, the 
legislature intended for the two crimes to protect  the same 
societal interests, and t he two crimes produce the same result.  
Lastly, given that second-degree reckless endangering is based  
upon an intermediate degree of culpability between assault in  
the second and third degree s, reckless endangering in the second ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
21 degree must also be considered a n included offense of second-
degree assault.  We therefore hold  that reckless endangering in 
the second degree  is an included offense of assault in the 
second degree under HRS §  707-711(1)(d) .  
2. There was a rational basis in the evidence to acquit 
Manuel of assault in the second degree and convict him 
of reckless endangering in the second degree. 
Manuel argues that there is a rational basis to 
support the second-degree reckless endangering instruction.  
Manuel asserts that “[t]here is no question that Manuel wielded 
the knife in complete disregard of the risk that his conduct 
placed Dison in danger of death or se rious bodily injury,” and 
that  
based on the eviden ce that was presented, the jury could 
have acquitted [Manuel] of the charged offense of assault 
in the second degree based on intentionally or knowingly 
causing bodily injury with a dangerous instrument and 
convicted him of the included offense of reckless ly 
engaging in conduct that placed Dison in danger of death or 
serious bodily injury.   
We have made clear that “jury instructions on lesser-
included offenses must be given where there is a rational basis 
in the evidence for a verdict acquitting the defend ant of the 
offense charged and convicting the defendant of the included 
offense.”  Flores, 131 Hawaiʻi at 51, 314 P.3d at 128. 
Here, there was a rational basis in the evidence to 
acquit Manuel of second-degree assault and to convict him of ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
22 reckless endangering in the second degree  based on the state of 
mind and conduct element s of second-degree reckless endangering . 
First, there was a rational basis for the jury to find 
that Manuel acted recklessly.  Notably, Dison’s testimony raises 
questions regarding his credibility.  For example, although 
Dison spoke with detectives after the incident, he did not tell  
the detectives about crucial details such as hearing the knife 
blade click into place or that Manuel said “That’s what you 
get.”  Additionally, although Dison asserted that he had not 
been drinking, at least two officers testified that they smelled 
alcohol on Dison.  Moreover, the officers testified that Manuel 
appeared to have been drinking on the night of the incident as 
well.  Thus, a reasonable juror could have found that Dison’s 
testimony was not entirely credible and that Manuel lacked the 
requisite intent, i.e., intentionally or knowingly, to commit 
second-degree assault.  However, a reasonable juror may still 
have determined that an intoxicated Manuel should have 
understood the potential risk of serious injury arising from 
opening a knife during an altercation.  Accordingly, the jury 
could have found that Manuel acted recklessly.  
Second, there was a rational basis for the jury to 
find that Manuel’s conduct (stabbing and cutting Dison) placed 
Dison in danger of serious bodily injury or death.  Again, 
HRS § 707-700 defines “dangerous instrument” as a firearm or a ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
23 “weapon, device, instrument, material, or substance .  . . , 
which in the manner it is used or is intended to be used is 
known to be capable of producing death or serious bodily 
injury.”  (Empha sis added .)  The circuit court instructed the 
jury on assault in the second and third degree s with a dangerous 
instrument.   The use of a dangerous instrument placed Dison in 
danger of death or serious injury  by definition , because the 
statutory definition requires a dangerous instrument to be used 
or intended to be used in a way that is capable of causing death 
or serious bodily injury.  See HRS § 707-700.  Even setting the 
dangerous instrument instruction aside, there was  a rational 
basis in the evidence for the jury to conclude that Manuel 
placed Dison in danger of death or serious bodily injury.  
Manuel stabbed Dison in the chest with a three -inch blade.   It 
was dark and Ma nuel may have been intoxicated .  Manuel could 
have severed a major blood vessel or punctured a lung, resulting 
in Dison’s death or serious bodily injury.  Therefore, there was 
a rational basis in the evidence for the jury to find that the 
conduct element of reckless endangering in the second degree  was 
met.   
There was consequently a rational basis in the 
evidence to support the state of mind and conduct element s of 
second-degree reckless endangering .  Therefore, there was a 
rational basis in the evidence to convict Manuel of reckless ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
24 endangering in the second degree , and the circuit court erred 
when it failed to instruct  the jury accordingly.  
IV. CONCLUSION  
We hold that reckless endangering in the second degree  
is a lesser -included offense of assault in the second degree .  
Because, in this case, there was a  rational basis in the 
evidence to acquit Manuel of assault in the second degree  and to 
convict him of reckless endangering in the second degree , the 
circuit court erred in failing to instruct the jury on reckless 
endangering in the second degree .  Accordingly, we vacate the 
ICA’s May 20, 2019, Judgment on Appeal, which affirmed the 
circuit court’s May 3, 2018, Judgment of Conviction and Sentence 
and remand for a new trial.
