OPINION OF THE COURT BY POLLACK, J.  
 
  When a driver in the State of Hawai i is involved in an 
accident that causes damage to another person’s vehicle or 
property, the driver is required by law to stop the vehicle at, 
or as close as possible to, the accident scene and remain there 
until the driver has provided certain identifying information.  
The applicable statute also requires that every such stop be 
made without obstructing traffic more than is necessary.  In Electronically Filed

 this case, we consider whether the State must include this 
additional statutory requirement when charging a driver with the 
offense of not stopping at 
an accident scene and providing the 
required information.  We answer this question in the 
affirmative.  We also conclude that the State failed to prove in 
this case that the defendant did not provide the required 
statutory information to the police after the accident. 
I. BACKGROUND 
  On October 26, 2017, at 3:35 p.m., 
Celeste Baker was 
issued a traffic citation for violating Hawai i Revised Statutes 
(HRS) §§ 291C- 13, Leaving Scene of Accident Involving Vehicle 
Damage (failure to stop),1 and 431:10C- 104, No Motor Vehicle 
Insurance Policy.  The citation contained Baker’s name, address, 
driver’s license number, and date of birth.  T he citation also 
listed the license plate number, make, model, type, color, and 
year of Baker’s vehicle.  One month later, the State filed a 
                     
 1 HRS § 291C-13 (Supp. 2008) provides the following in full:  
The driver of any vehicle involved in an accident resulting 
only in damage to a vehicle or other property that is 
driven or attended by any person shall immediately stop 
such vehicle at the scene of the accident or as close 
thereto as possible, but shall forthwith return to, and in 
every event shall remain at, the scene of the accident 
until the driver has fulfilled the requirements of section 
291C-14.  Every such stop shall be made without obstructing 
traffic more than is necessary.  For any violation under 
this section, a surcharge of up to $100 may be imposed, in 
addition to other penalties, which shall be deposited into 
the trauma system special fund.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
3 (continued . . .)  
 two-count complaint in the district court alleging that Baker 
violated HRS §§ 291C-13 and 431:10C -104.2  Count 1 of the 
complaint states as follows: 
COUNT 1: On or about October 26, 2017, in the City and 
County of Honolulu, State of Hawai ‘i, CELESTE BAKER, as the 
driver of a vehicle involved in an accident resulting only 
in damage to a vehicle or other property that was driven or 
attended by a person, did intentionally, knowingly or 
recklessly fail to immediately stop such vehicle at the 
scene of the accident or as close thereto as possible, and 
did intentionally, knowingly or recklessly fail to 
forthwith return to, and in every event remain at, the 
scene of the accident and fulfill the requirements of [HRS 
§ 291C-14], thereby committing the offense of Accidents 
Involving Damage to Vehicle or Property in violation of 
[HRS § 291C-13].  [HRS § 291C-14] requires that the driver 
of any vehicle involved in an accident resulting in . . . 
damage to any vehicle or other property which is driven or 
attended by any person shall give the driver’s name, 
address, and the registration number of the vehicle the 
driver is driving, and shall upon request and if available 
exhibit the driver’s license . . . to the driver or 
occupant of or person attending any vehicle or other 
property damaged in the accident and shall give such 
information . . . to any police officer at the scene of the 
accident or who is investigating the accident and shall 
render to any person injured in the accident reasonable 
assistance, . . . .  In the event that none of the persons 
specified is in condition to receive the information to 
which they otherwise would be entitled under [HRS §  291C-
14(a)], and no police officer is present, [HRS §  291C-
14(b)] requires that the driver of any vehicle involved in 
the accident after fulfilling all other requirements of 
[HRS §§ 291C-12 and 291C- 14(a)], insofar as possible on the 
driver’s part to be performed, shall forthwith report the 
accident to the nearest police officer and submit thereto 
the information specified in [HRS §  291C-14(a)]. 
 
  Baker pleaded not guilty to the charge.3  A bench trial 
commenced on January 29, 2018.4  
                     
 2 Count 2 alleged that Baker violated HRS § 431:10C- 104.  This 
count was later dismissed.  The dismissal is not an issue on appeal.  
3 The oral charge read at trial tracked the language in the 
complaint but did not include a recitation of the statutory requirements a

   The State’s first witness at trial was Megumi Moon, 
who testified that on October 26, 2017, at approximately 2:04 
p.m., the vehicle she was driving was involved in an accident.  
She stated that the collision occurred just before the bus stop 
at Blaisdell Park as she was proceeding eastbound on Kamehameha 
Highway towards Honolulu.  Moon described the part of the 
highway where the collision occurred as a “zigzag” due to 
construction.  A car was driving in front of her  in the right 
lane of the two-lane highway, Moon explained, and the car 
switched to the left lane; as they passed  a traffic light, the 
car merged back into her  lane, and the rear end of the other car 
hit the front driver side fender of her vehicle.  Moon 
identified Baker in court as the driver of the other car in the 
collision.  Moon explained that she knew Baker’s car hit her 
vehicle because she felt the impact and there was a dent on the 
front fender wall of her vehicle.5  
 
                                                                              
(. . . continued) 
 
driver must fulfill when the other motorist is unable to receive the driver’s 
information and no police are present.  
 
 4 The Honorable Randal I. Shintani presided.  
 5 No picture of the dent was entered into evidence.  Moon also 
indicated that there were five other occupants in her vehicle, none of whom 
testified.   
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
5 
   After the collision occurred, Moon explained, she 
immediately signaled Baker to pull over, and they got out of 
their cars.  Moon testified that she asked for Baker’s license 
and registration, but that Baker would not provide them to her,  
and they got into an argument.  Moon stated that while they were 
stopped on the highway, she called the police and waited a while 
for them to arrive.   
  
According to Moon, when Baker refused to provide her 
information, she told Baker to meet at “Anna Miller’s” because 
they were holding up traffic.  Moon testified that Baker said 
she was not from Hawai i, but that she knew where Anna Miller’s 
was and agreed to meet there in the parking lot.  Moon 
acknowledged that Anna Miller’s was on the other side of 
Kamehameha Highway from the direction in which she was driving, 
and that there were other places they could have gone by turning  
to the right.   
  
Moon testified that she called the police when she 
arrived at Anna Miller’s, and that she drove around the parking 
lot and waited for about thirty minutes but did not see Baker.  
Moon stated that she filled out a police report when police 
arrived approximately an hour and a half later.   
  Officer Brandon Kam of the Honolulu Police Department 
testified that he responded to a report of a motor vehicle 
collision at approximately 2:30 p.m., and that i t was a “call of ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
6 
 somebody wanting to report [a] motor vehicle collision . . . 
away from the scene.”  The officer could not recall where he was 
directed to go , but he testified that he met Baker when he 
arrived at the indicated location.   
  According to the officer, Baker stated that she was 
being accused of colliding with another vehicle and that the 
occupants in the other vehicle had been hostile toward her, 
yelled at her, and asked for $700.  While making his report, 
Officer Kam explained, he received an update via dispatch of a 
“fled type scene” and ceased his discussion with Baker so that 
he could get further clarification.  The officer stated that he 
determined the update was related to the same vehicle collision 
that he was discussing with Baker.  The of ficer testified that 
while he was at the scene he did not observe any visible damage 
to Baker’s vehicle.   
 
 Baker testified that she worked as a sales associate, 
was also a student, and had lived in Hawai i for only one year.  
Baker recounted that, on the day in question, she was driving 
home when she saw a vehicle to her right driving very close, and 
that she stuck her hand out the window because it appeared the 
driver of the vehicle was trying to alert her to something.  
Baker stated that she “wasn’t sure what was going on,” so she 
pulled her vehicle to the side of the road.  She immediately got 
out of the car, Baker testified, and the driver began “yelling ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
7 
 at me that I hit her car.”  Baker explained that she responded 
to Moon that she had not hit her vehicle, and that she did not 
see a dent in Moon’s vehicle or damage to her own car.   
  Baker also stated that Moon never asked for her 
insurance information because Moon “was too busy yelling,” and 
therefore she never refused to provide such information.  Baker 
said that she tried to calm Moon down and asked Moon for her 
name.  According to Baker, Moon did 
calm down, they exchanged 
first names, and she asked Moon to meet on the side of the road.  
Moon agreed, Baker testified, and Baker pulled to the right side 
of the same road that they first stopped
, but Moon wasn’t there.  
Baker testified that she stopped at an auto repair place and 
waited for Moon to arrive, but when Moon did not show up she 
called the police.  Baker also denied Moon’s statement that Moon 
asked her to meet at Anna Miller’s.   
  During closing arguments, the State argued that Baker 
did not stay at the scene, exchange information, and file a 
police report as required by the failure to stop statute.  
Defense counsel contended that Baker did not intentionally, 
knowingly, or recklessly violate the statute,  but that instead 
Baker attempted to comply with its terms by pulling over when 
she was accused of hitting a car and calling the police soon 
after the incident occurred.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
8 
   The district court found Baker guilty of failing to 
comply with the requirements of HRS §  291C-13, stating that the 
court’s decision was based on “the demeanor and credibility of 
the witness,” “the testimony of Ms. Moon, Officer Kam, as well 
as Ms. Baker,” and “the time frame  in which the testimony was 
elicited.”6  The court imposed a fine of $100 and other fees in 
its January 29, 2018 Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order 
and Plea/Judgment (Judgment).7  Baker timely appealed. 
II. ICA PROCEEDINGS 
  
On appeal, Baker argued that there was insufficient 
evidence to sustain her conviction for the reason that, because 
it was necessary for the parties to move their vehicles out of 
traffic, the State was required to prove that the stop at the 
accident scene could have been made without obstructing traffic 
                    
 
 6 The entirety of the district court’s ruling was as follows : 
Okay.  Court’s ready to rule.  Court, considering the 
demeanor and credibility of the witness, court’s going to 
find Ms. Baker guilty as charged of failing to comply with 
the requirements of 291C -13.  Court, considering the 
testimony of Ms. Moon, Officer  Kam, as well as Ms. Baker, 
considering the time frame in which the testimony was 
elicited, and again based on the credibility of the 
witness, court’s basing its decision.  
 
It is unclear whether the district court’s decision as to guilt was based on 
Baker not remaining at the scene, not going to Anna Miller’s, not providing 
the requisite information to Moon or the officer, or a combination of these 
circumstances.   
 
 7 On May 7, 2018 , the district court issued a Notice of Entry of 
Judgment and/Order and Plea/Judgment (Restitution Order) ordering Baker to 
pay restitution in the amount of $2,262.58.   
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
9 
 more than necessary.  Baker maintained that she fulfilled the 
statutory requirements of HRS §  291C-14 (duty to give 
information) by calling the police and reporting the incident 
after moving her car.  Baker also contended that the complaint 
and oral charge failed to adequately and fully inform her of the 
nature and cause of the accusation against her because they did 
not allege the attendant circumstance that “[e]very stop shall 
be made without obstructing traffic mor e than is necessary.”8  
This omission rendered  the charge deficient even under the post-
conviction liberal construction rule, argued Baker. 
  The State responded that “stopping without obstructing 
traffic more than necessary” is not an element of the offense of 
failure to stop.  No Hawai i case required the State to prove 
that a stop “was able to be done without obstructing traffic 
more than necessary,” the State maintained.   Since proving this 
circumstance is not an element of the crime, the State 
contended, and Baker did not challenge the sufficiency of the 
charge prior to conviction, the liberal 
rule of construction 
applied to reviewing the charge.  As to the sufficiency of the 
evidence, the State asserted that Moon’s testimony demonstrated 
                     
 8 Additionally, Baker contended that the court erred in ordering 
restitution.  The ICA ruled in Baker’s favor on this issue and reversed the 
Restitution Order.  Neither party challenges the ruling on certiorari review.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
10 
 that Baker failed to provide the required statutory information 
to Moon at the scene or at Anna Miller’s or  give the information 
to Officer Kam.  Baker therefore violated the failure to stop 
statute, argued the State.   
  In a Summary Disposition Order,9 the Intermediate Court 
of Appeals (ICA) stated that to prove the offense of failure to 
stop, the State was required to prove that (1
) Baker’s vehicle 
was involved in an accident resulting only in damage to another 
motorist’s vehicle; (2) Baker failed to immediately stop at the 
scene or as close thereto as possible; and (3) Baker failed to 
remain there until she fulfilled her duty to give information.  
(Citing State v. Gartrell
, 9 Haw. App. 156, 158, 828 P.2d 298, 
299-300 (1992).)  The ICA found that the State presented 
evidence that Baker’s car struck and caused damage to Moon’s 
vehicle, and that Baker left the accident scene before providing 
any information other than her first name to Moon.10  The ICA 
noted that the district court did not credit Baker’s testimony 
                     
 9 The ICA’s Summary Disposition Order can be found at State v. 
Baker, No. CAAP- 18-0000454, 2019 WL 1747026 (App. Apr. 18, 2019) (SDO).  
 
 10 The ICA further stated that testimony presented by the State 
supported the court’s conclusion that Baker did not, at any time, make the 
required statutory disclosures to Moon or Officer Kam.  However, the district 
court did not specifically make this determination.  See s upra note 6. 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
11 
 that she remained where the parties had agreed to meet.11  Thus, 
the ICA concluded that there was substantial evidence to support 
the conviction under HRS § 291C-13.   
  The ICA also determined that there was no requirement 
that the State prove, as an element of the
 offense of failure to 
stop, that Baker knew the stop was made without obstructing 
traffic more than is necessary.  The ICA instead described this 
part of the statute as an “explanatory clause” that serves to 
“more clearly define the element ” of stopping at the accident 
scene or as close thereto as possible.  Because the explanatory 
clause is not an element of the offense, the ICA concluded, its 
omission in the complaint and oral charge did not render them 
deficient.   
The ICA thus affirmed the district court’s Judgment 
finding Baker guilty of violating HRS § 291C-13.  Baker’s 
application for certiorari challenging the ICA’s rulings was 
accepted by this court.  
III.  STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Sufficiency of a  Charge 
  Whether a charge sets forth all the essential elements 
of a charged offense is a question of law, which we review under 
                     
 11 The district court also did not expressly find Baker’s testimony 
not credible.  See supra note 6. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
12 
 the de novo, or right/wrong, standard.  State v. Wheeler, 121 
Hawaii 383, 390, 219 P.3d 1170, 1177 (2009). 
B. Sufficiency of the Evidence 
  In reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the 
evidence, “[e]vidence adduced in the trial court must be 
considered in the strongest light for the prosecution[.]”  State 
v. Kalaola, 124 Hawai i 43, 49, 237 P.3d 1109, 1115 (2010) 
(quoting State v. Richie, 88 Hawai i  19, 33, 960 P.2d 1227, 1241 
(1998)).  “The test on appeal is not whether guilt is 
established beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether there was 
substantial evidence to support the conclusion of the trier of 
fact.”  Id.   
IV. DISCUSSION 
A. The Complain t Was Insufficient.  
  Baker argues that because the c omplaint and oral 
charge omitted the language “[e] very such stop shall be made 
without obstructing traffic more than is necessary ,” which is an 
“attendant circumstances element and/or essential fact []” of the 
offense, the charge was deficient and violated her right to due 
process of law. 
  The sufficiency of a charge “implicates an accused’s 
rights under the 
Hawaii Constitution, article I, sections 5, 10 
and 14.”  State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai i 48, 52, 27 6 P.3d 617, 621 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
13 
 (2012).  Under article I, section 5, “No person shall be 
deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of 
law[.]”  Haw. Const. art. I, § 5.  And under article I, section 
14, an accused is entitled to adequate notice of the charge: “In 
all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the 
right . . . to be informed of the nature and cause of the 
accusation[.]”  Haw. Const. art. I, §  14.  Accordingly, if a 
charge is defective, it “amounts to a failure to state an 
offense, and a conviction based upon it cannot be sustained, for 
that would constitute a denial of due process.”  State v. 
Wheeler, 121 Hawai i 383, 391, 219 P.3d 1170, 1178 (2009) 
(quoting State v. Merino, 81 Hawai i 198, 212, 915 P.2d 672, 686 
(1996)). 
  It is well settled that when the State alleges that a 
person committed a crime, the “accusation must sufficiently 
allege all of the essential elements of the offense charged.”  
Id.  In addition to containing all of the elements of the 
offense, the charge must also sufficiently apprise the defendant 
of what the defendant must be prepared to meet.  Id.   And 
generally, “[w]here the statute sets forth with reasonable 
clarity all essential elements of the crime intended to be 
punished, and fully defines the offense in unmistakable terms 
readily comprehensible to persons of common understanding, a ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
14 
 charge drawn in the language of the statute is sufficient.”   Id. 
at 393, 219 P.3d at 1180 (alteration in original) (quoting State 
v. Jendrusch, 58 Haw. 279, 282, 567 P.2d 1242, 1245 (1977)).  In 
some cases, however, a charge tracking the language of the 
statute will be insufficient to adequately describe the crime 
and will violate due process.  Nesmith, 127 Hawai i at 53, 276 
P.3d at 622 .   
The “elements” of an offense, which must be alleged 
and proved by the State, are (1) conduct, (2) attendant 
circumstances, and (3) results of conduct.  HRS §  702-205 
(2014).  An attendant circumstance is a circumstance that 
“exist[s] independently of the [actor’s conduct] .”  State v. 
Aiwohi, 109 Hawai i 115, 127, 123 P.3d 1210, 1222 (2005) 
(alterations in original).  Additionally, under Hawai i Rules of 
Penal Procedure Rule 7(d) (2012), a charge must contain “a 
plain, concise and definite statement of the essential facts 
constituting the offense charged.”  The State must also allege 
the requisite state of mind for each element of the offense.  
State v. Apollonio, 130 Hawai i 353, 359, 311 P.3d 676, 682 
(2013); HRS §§ 701-114 (2014), 702-204 (2014).  The state of 
mind must be included in the charge “to alert the defendant[] of 
precisely what [the defendant] need[s] to defend against to ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
15 avoid a conviction.”  Nesmith, 127 Hawai i at 56, 276 P.3d at 
625. 
Here, HRS §  291C-13 provides in relevant part the 
following: 
The driver of any vehicle involved in an accident resulting 
only in damage to a vehicle or other property that is 
driven or attended by any person shall immediately stop 
such vehicle at the scene of the accident or as close 
thereto as possible, but shall forthwith return to, and in 
every event shall remain at, the scene of the accident 
until the driver has fulfilled the requirements of section 
291C-14.  Every such stop shall be made without obstructing 
traffic more than is necessary.  
HRS § 291C-13 thus places a duty on a driver who is 
involved in an accident that causes damage to another vehicle to
(1) immediately stop at the scene of the accident or  (2) stop
“as close thereto as possible” and “forthwith return” to the 
accident scene.  The second alternative requires a driver who 
does not stop immediately following the accident to stop as 
close as possible  to the accident scene and then forthwith 
return to that location.  “Possible” is commonly understood to 
mean “able to be done; within the power or capacity of someone 
or something.”  The New Oxford American Dictionary 1332 (2001). 
Since it is “possible” for a driver to stop very close to the 
accident scene, which may  be in the middle of a crowded freeway,
a driver may reasonably believe that the statute mandates that 
the driver must stop “as close” to the scene of the accident “as
possible.”   
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
16 But the failure to stop statute also requires that 
“[e]very [] stop shall be made without obstructing traffic more 
than is necessary.”  HRS § 291C-13.  This statutory requirement 
must be read in conjunction with its corresponding requirement 
to “immediately stop  . . . at the scene of the accident or as 
close thereto as possible. ”  Thus, the failure to stop statute 
plainly recognizes that a stop that is as close to the accident 
scene as possible may be one that obstructs traffic more than is
necessary.  See Richardson v. City & Cty. of Honolulu, 76 Hawai i
46, 71, 868 P.2d 1193, 1218 (1994) (“[C]ourts are bound, if 
rational and practicable, to give effect to all parts of a 
statute, and [] no clause, sentence, or word shall be construed 
as superfluous, void, or insignificant.” (quoting Methven–Abreu 
v. Hawaiian Ins. & Guar. Co., 73 Haw. 385, 392, 834 P.2d 279,
284 (1992))).  Accordingly, while a driver involved in an 
accident that results in property damage to another’s vehicle is
mandated to stop immediately or as close to the scene of the 
accident as possible, the stop must not unnecessarily obstruct 
traffic.   
 
 
It is thus apparent that the duty to stop at the 
accident scene or as close thereto as possible is subject to the 
statutory requirement that the stop be made without obstructing 
traffic more than is necessary.  Consequently, the phrase “as 
close [] as possible,” as used in HRS § 291C-13, does not ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
17 
 necessarily coincide with its common meaning.  Rather, a stop 
“as close thereto as possible ” is qualified to the extent that 
the stop should not obstruct traffic more than is necessary.  
See Wheeler, 121 Hawai i at 394, 219 P.3d at 1181 (the meaning of 
the term “operate” as used in the statute was not the same as 
its commonly understood definition, and the term was therefore 
not “readily comprehensible to persons of common 
understanding”)
; State v. Pacquing, 139 Hawai i  302, 308, 389 
P.3d 897, 903 (2016) (statuto ry definition of “confidential 
personal information” differed from its “commonly understood 
definition” and thus simply including the statutory phrase in 
the complaint was insufficient to apprise the defendant of what 
the defendant must be prepared to meet) .  
  The inclusion of the statutory language to not 
obstruct traffic more than is necessary means that a driver is 
required to not cause an unnecessary traffic obstruction or 
create a risk to other drivers when stopping.  That is, the 
legislature intended to avoid the hazardous traffic situation or 
serious traffic congestion that might occur were drivers to 
exchange information in a location that obstructed traffic more 
than is necessary.  Indeed, stopping immediately or very close 
to the accident’s locati on could result 
in a series of 
successive accidents, with the subsequent accidents causing ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
18 
 greater harm and being a greater risk to safety than the 
original accident.  A driver therefore does not violate the 
statute by not stopping at the scene, by not stopping as close 
as “possible” to the scene, or not returning to the scene of the 
accident, if doing so would prevent a traffic hazard that would 
otherwise result.   
Thus, a driver, in lieu of stopping as close as 
possible to the scene of the accident, may instead stop at the 
closest location to the accident scene that does not result in 
an unnecessary traffic obstruction--without violating the 
statute.  By the same token, the requirement to “forthwith 
return” to the scene of the accident is also subject to t he 
qualification that the “return” to the accident scene can be 
done without obstructing traffic more than is necessary.  The 
requirement that the stop was made without obstructing traffic 
more than is necessary is thus a requisite aspect of proof of 
the offense when the driver stops at, or forthwith returns to, a 
location that the State contends is not as close as “possible” 
to the accident scene
.   
Accordingly, when a defendant stops in close proximity 
of the accident scene and provides the requisite information, 
the State, in order to show a violation of the statute, is 
required to prove the following: (1) the defendant failed  to 
stop at a location that was as close to the scene of the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
19 
 accident as possible, or to forthwith return thereto, and (2) 
the failure did not result from the defendant avoiding an 
unnecessary obstruction of traffic.   
  Thus, HRS § 291C-13 contains the following elements: 
(1) the defendant was driving a vehicle that was involved 
in an accident resulting only in damage to a vehicle or  
other property;  
 
(2) the vehicle or property was driven or attended by 
another person;  
 
(3) the defendant did not  
 
(a) immediately stop at the scene of the accident, or 
at a location as close thereto as possible and 
forthwith return to the scene that would not have 
obstructed traffic more than is necessary;  
 
or  
  
(b) provide the information required by section 291C -
14 to the other driver and any police officer at the 
scene, or, in their absence, forthwith report the 
accident to the nearest police officer and provide 
that information to the officer.   
 
HRS §§ 291C-13,  291C-14.  The State is also required to allege 
that each element was committed intentionally, knowingly, or 
recklessly when charging this offense.12 
  In this case, Baker challenged the sufficiency of the 
charge for the first 
time on appeal, and the liberal 
                     
 12 Because HRS § 291C-13 does not contain a mens rea, HRS § 702-204 
applies.  HRS § 702-204 (“When the state of mind required to establish an 
element of an offense is not specified by the law, that element is 
established if, with respect thereto, a person acts intentionally, knowingly, 
or recklessly.”); HRS § 701-102(3) (2014) (“The provisions of chapters 701 
through 706 of the Code are applicable to offenses defined by other statutes, 
unless the Code otherwise provides .”). ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
20 
 construction standard is thus applied in reviewing  the charge.  
State v. Motta, 66 Haw. 89, 90, 657 P.2d 1019, 1019- 20 (1983); 
State v. Wells, 78 Hawai ‘i 373, 381, 894 P.2d 70, 78 (1995); see 
also State v. Kauhane, 145 Hawai i 362, 372-73, 452 P.3d 359, 
369-70 (2019)  (holding that the charge was insufficient under 
the Motta/Wells rule because the common definition of 
“obstructs” did not comport with its statutory definition).   
Under this standard, we consider whether the charge can 
reasonably be construed to charge an offense or, alternatively, 
whether the defendant was prejudiced.   Kauhane, 145 at 369 -70, 
452 P.3d at 366-6 7.  A complaint, for example, cannot reasonably 
be construed to charge an offense if it omits an element of the 
offense or when the common definition of an element of an 
offense set forth 
in the charge does not comport with its 
statutory definition.  Pacquing , 139 Hawai i at 308, 389 P.3d at 
903; Wheeler, 121 Hawai i at 394, 219 P.3d at 118 1.   
The State in this case did not specify in the 
complaint that Baker did not stop either at the accident scene 
or stop at the location closest to the accident scene and  
forthwith return thereto without obstructing traffic more than 
is necessary.  The State’s omission of this statutory 
qualification did not provide Baker with fair notice of the 
elements of the offense charged.  Wheeler, 121 Hawai i at 395, ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
21 
 219 P.3d at 1182.  In fact, the charge did not include any 
reference to the language “ without obstructing traffic more than 
is necessary” or include language similar to it.  The failure to 
include the statutory language  resulted in this element of the 
charge having a common meaning that differed from the express 
statutory requirements, and thus neither the complaint nor the 
oral charge can be reasonably construed to charge an offense.
  
Id.  Accordingly, the deficient charge deprived Baker of the 
right to due process.  Nesmith , 127 Hawai i at 52, 276 P.3d at 
621.  As a result, the State failed to state an offense, and the 
conviction based upon it cannot be sustained.  Kauhane, 145 
Hawaii at 373, 452 P.3d at  370; Pacquing, 139 Hawaii at 308, 389 
P.3d at 903; Wheeler, 121 Hawai i at 391, 219 P.3d 1178.   
  The ICA  concluded that the phrase requiring every stop 
to be made without obstructing traffic more than necessary in 
the failure to stop statute was merely an “explanatory clause” 
that “serves to more clearly define” the element of the offense 
pertaining to the d river’s duty to stop, but that the clause did 
not impose an additional conduct requirement that the State must 
prove.  We do not endorse the ICA’ s “explanatory clause ” 
framework.  The State must prove that the  defendant, by failing 
to stop as close to the scene  of the accident as possible or 
forthwith return, could have done so without obstructing traffic ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
22 more than is necessary.  The charging instrument in this case 
did not adequately set forth the elements of the offense so that 
the charge was “readily com prehensible to persons of common 
understanding. ”  Wheeler, 121 Hawaii at 394-95, 219 P.3d at  
1181-82.  The complaint therefore failed to give Baker proper 
notice of the elements of the offense with which she was 
charged, and the ICA erred in concluding that the charge was not 
deficient.13
B. The Evidence W as Insufficient T o Convict Baker Under
HRS § 291C-13. 
Baker also contends that there was not sufficient 
evidence to prove that she intentionally, knowingly,  or 
recklessly failed to comply with the failure to stop offense.  
See HRS § 291C- 13.  
As explained, to prove that Baker violated HRS §  291C-
13, the State was required to prove that (1) Baker was driving a 
vehicle that was involved in an accident resulting only in 
damage to a vehicle or other property; (2) the vehicle or 
property was driven or attended by another person; (3) Baker did 
13To the extent that the following cases do not require the 
qualifying language “without obstructing traffic more than is necessary” to 
be included in the charge, they are overruled: State v. Gartrell , 9 Haw. App.

23 (continued . . .)  
 not (a) immediately stop at the scene or stop as close thereto 
as possible and forthwith return to the scene
 without 
obstructing traffic more than is necessary; or (b) give the 
required information to the other driver and any police officer 
at the scene, or, in their absence, forthwith report the 
accident to the nearest police officer  and provide the required 
information after fulfilling other statutory requirements 
insofar as possible.  The State was also required to prove that 
Baker committed each element of the offense intentionally, 
knowingly, or recklessly.  HRS §§ 291C-13, 701-114, 702-204.  
  To fulfill the requirements of the duty to give 
information statute, HRS § 291C-14,14 Baker was required to 
                     
 14 HRS § 291C-14 (2014) provides, in relevant part, the following:  
(a) The driver of any vehicle involved in an accident 
resulting in  . . . damage to any vehicle or other property 
which is driven or attended by any person shall give the 
driver’s name, address, and the registration number of the 
vehicle the driver is driving, and shall upon request and 
if available exhibit the driver’s license or permit to 
drive to . . . the driver or occupant of or person 
attending any vehicle or other property damaged in the 
accident and shall give such information and upon request 
exhibit such license or permit to any police officer at the 
scene of the accident or who is investigating the 
accident . . . . 
(b) In the event that none of the persons specified is in 
condition to receive the information to which they 
otherwise would be entitled under subsection (a), and no 
police officer is present, the driver of any vehicle 
involved in the accident after fulfilling all other 
requirements of  . . . subsection (a) of this section, 
insofar as possible on the driver’s part to be performed, 
shall forthwith report the accident to the nearest police 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
24 
 provide her name, address, and the registration number of her 
vehicle to Moon and any police officer at the scene of the 
accident or who is investigating the accident, and, if 
requested, exhibit her driver’s license .  HRS § 291C-14(a).  
However, if it was not possible to exchange this information--
such as when the other motorist is not in a condition to receive 
the information and no police officer is present--Baker was 
required to promptly report the accident to the nearest police 
officer and provide the required information after fulfilling 
other statutory requirements insofar as possible .  HRS §  291C-
14(b). 
  Moon testified that the collision occurred at 
approximately 2:04 p.m. on October 26, 2017.15  After the 
collision occurred, Moon immediately signaled to Baker to pull 
over, she explained, and Baker complied.  Moon stated that there 
was construction on the part of the highway where the collision 
occurred that caused the road to “zigzag.”  Moon testified that 
                                                                              
(. . . continued) 
 
officer and submit thereto the information specified in 
subsection (a). 
 15 As to the first two elements of the offense, there is no dispute 
that Baker and Moon were driving their vehicles.  And accepting Moon’s 
testimony that she felt the impact of the contact  and saw damage to her car, 
there was substantial evidence th at an accident resulting in damage to Moon’s 
car occurred. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
25 
 after Baker refused to provide her license and registration, she 
told Baker to meet at Anna Miller’s because they were holding up 
traffic.  Moon testified that Anna Miller ’s was on the opposite  
side of the highway that they were on and that there were 
alternative places to turn right.   
 
 Officer Kam’s testimony indicated that he responded to 
Baker’s report of a collision within t hirty minutes after the 
collision.  The officer testified that when he arrived at the 
location he had been directed to, he spoke with Baker  and she 
told him that she was being accused of colliding with another 
vehicle.  Neither Moon’s testimony nor Officer  Kam’s testimony 
provided any details as to Baker’s location after the accident.   
  Pursuant to the failure to stop statute, Baker was not 
required to remain at the location of the accident scene because 
the stopped vehicles were unnecessarily obstructing traffic.  
And neither Officer Kam’s testimony nor other evidence presented 
by the State provided substantial evidence that Baker did not 
stop at a location as close to the scene of the accident as 
possible without unnecessarily obstructing traffic.  The 
evidence accordingly did not prove, as required by the failure 
to stop statute, that Baker failed to immediately stop or stop 
as close as possible to the scene of the accident without 
obstructing traffic more than is necessary.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
26 
   Similarly, the State also did not prove that Baker 
violated the statute by her failure to “forthwith return” t o the 
scene of the accident.  Returning to the accident scene would 
have require d Baker to stop her vehicle on a busy highway under 
construction in a location that the evidence does not show would 
not have obstructed traffic more than is necessary.  The State 
therefore failed to provide evidence that the second stop made 
by Baker did not conform to the statute’s requirements.  
  The State could alternatively sustain a conviction in 
this case if it provided substantial evidence that Baker failed 
to comply with her duty to give information.  There is no 
dispute in this case that after Moon and Baker’s interaction at 
the initial stop, they did not meet again.  Because Baker was 
not required to remain at or “forthwith return” to the location 
of the initial stop,
 it follows that she could not exchange 
information with Moon or a police officer at the scene of the 
accident.  Accordingly, Moon was not in a condition to receive 
the information as she was not present, and thus Baker was 
required to promptly report the accident to police and provide 
the required information.   
  The evidence was uncontroverted that Baker called the 
police and reported the accident shortly after it occurred.  
This complies with the statutory requirement that Baker 
forthwith report the accident to the nearest police officer.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
27 
 Officer Kam’s testimony did not explain what information Baker 
provided or, more importantly,  any information that she did not 
provide when he spoke with her.  Absent this evidence, the State 
did not prove that Baker failed to fulfill her duty to give 
information.16 
  
The ICA incorrectly held that the testimony supported 
the district court’s conclusion that Baker did not, at any time, 
make the required statutory disclosure to Moon or Officer Kam 
when in fact the district court did not make this conclusion.17  
Nor does the record indicate what information Baker did or did 
not provide to Officer Kam.  It was the State’s burden to 
present evidence demonstrating that Baker did not comply with 
the failure to stop statute or give the required information to 
Officer Kam, and the State failed to do so.  The ICA thus erred 
in finding that there was substantial evidence to support the 
conviction. 
                     
 16 It is noted that the record in this case contains the citation 
issued by Officer Kam to Baker, which includes Baker’s name, address, and the 
identifying information of her vehicle (the vehicle’s  license plate number 
and its make, model, type, color, and year).  Thus, the citation indicates 
that Baker, at least, substantially complied with the duty to give 
information statute by providing her name, address, and vehicle information 
such that the vehicle’s owner could be located.  See State v. Villeza, 85 
Hawaii 258, 265, 942 P.2d 522, 529 (1997) (“We determine substantial 
compliance with a statute by determining whether the statute has been 
followed sufficiently such that the intent for which it was adopted is 
carried out.”).
