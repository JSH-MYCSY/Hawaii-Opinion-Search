  OPINION OF THE COURT BY RECKTENWALD, C.J. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
 
  The Association of Apartment Owners of Elima Lani 
Condominiums (AOAO) foreclosed on a unit owned by Thomas Blake 
K. David and Sarah L. David (the Davids) for failure to pay 
common assessments.  Later, Nationstar Mortgage, LLC 
(Nationstar) filed a complaint for foreclosure of the unit 
alleging the Davids had defaulted on their mortgage.  Almost two 
years after AOAO came into possession of the unit, the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit entered summary judgment and an 
interlocutory decree of foreclosure in favor of Nationstar.  
However, the circuit court did not confirm a foreclosure sale of 
the unit at a public auction until nearly eleven months later.  
AOAO contends that it is entitled to the rents that accrued from 
the unit during the period between summary judgment and the 
confirmation of sale.
1    
  Under our precedents, a foreclosure judgment is a 
final judgment extinguishing the previous owner’s interest in 
property.  Thus, at common law, AOAO would not be entitled to 
post-foreclosure rents.  However, and for the following reasons,
  Revised Statutes (HRS) § 514B-146(n) (Supp. we hold that Hawai ‘i 
 
                                                 
1  The total amount of rents collected during this period was
$6,200.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 2015) provides a scheme for distributing rents following a 
lender’s foreclosure against an association.  Here, provided 
AOAO has not already recouped its losses through the rent it 
previously collected, it may be entitled to all or some of the 
rent collected for Nationstar after summary judgment.  
Accordingly, we vacate the circuit court’s judgment to the 
extent it awards post-foreclosure rents to Nationstar and remand
for a calculation of what amount, if any, AOAO is owed from 
post-foreclosure rents. 2
 
II. BACKGROUND 
   On July 24, 2015, AOAO foreclosed on the Davids’ 
condominium for unpaid assessments via quitclaim deed, filed pursuant to the nonjudicial foreclosure process provided by 
HRS § 667, et seq. (2016).   
 
  On November 7, 2016, Nationstar filed a complaint for 
foreclosure in the circuit court, alleging the Davids had 
defaulted on a note and mortgage encumbering the unit and naming AOAO as one of the defendants.
3  AOAO answered, asserting its 
ownership interest in the property.  Nationstar filed a motion 
                                                 
2  HRS § 514B- 146(n) was numbered as HRS § 514B- 146(k) before the 
statute was renumbered in 2018, and it is referred to as HRS § 514B- 146(k) in 
the briefing.  See 2018 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 195, § 4 at 672.  Because there 
was no change to the substance of the statute, we refer to the current 
numbering, HRS § 514B- 146(n), throughout.  See id. 
 
3 The Honorable Ronald Ibarra presided over the proceedings for 
summary judgment, while the Honorable Robert D.S. Kim presided over the 
proceedings to confirm the foreclosure sale. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

  for summary judgment.  It asked that the court appoint a 
commissioner and direct that person to “[p]ossess, preserve, 
operate and manage the Property . . . including, but not limited 
to, collecting rental payments and revenues,” and to sell the 
property.  
 
  AOAO filed a memorandum in limited opposition to 
Nationstar’s motion for summary judgment.  In relevant part, 
AOAO argued it remained the owner of the unit until a 
foreclosure sale was confirmed by the court, that it was 
entitled to exclusive possession and use throughout the 
foreclosure process, and that its right to collect post-
foreclosure rents was reaffirmed by HRS § 514B-146(n).4   
                                                 
4  HRS § 514B- 146(n) provides: 
 
After any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure 
proceeding in which the association acquires title to the 
unit, any excess rental income received by the association from the unit shall be paid to existing lien holders based 
on the priority of lien, and not on a pro rata basis, and 
shall be applied to the benefit of the unit owner. 
 For 
purposes of this subsection, excess rental income shall be any net income received by the association after a court 
has issued a final judgment determining the priority of a 
senior mortgagee and after paying, crediting, or 
reimbursing the association or a third party for: 
(1)  The lien for delinquent assessments pursuant to 
subsections (a) and (b); 
(2)  Any maintenance fee delinquency against the unit;
 
(3)  Attorney’s fees and other collection costs 
related to the association’s foreclosure of the 
unit; or 
(4)  Any costs incurred by the association for the rental, repair, maintenance, or rehabilitation of 
the unit while the association is in possession 
of the unit including monthly association 
maintenance fees, management fees, real estate *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
5 
     The circuit court disagreed.  On June 30, 2017, it 
entered summary judgment against AOAO and an interlocutory 
decree of foreclosure in favor of Nationstar, finding that 
Nationstar was owed $382,957.56 in principal, interest, and 
costs.  Further, it appointed a commissioner to take possession of and sell the unit, and ordered: 
The Commissioner is authorized and directed, after the 
payment of all necessary expenses of such sale, to make 
application of all the proceeds thereof and all funds which they hold in their capacity as Commissioner so far as the 
same may be necessary to the payment of amounts found due 
and owing to [Nationstar] from the [Davids] under the Loan 
Documents
 . . . as determined by this court. 
 
   The unit was sold to Nationstar at a public auction on 
December 16, 2017.  Before the sale, the Commissioner collected 
$3,200 in total rents for the months of November 2017, December 
2017, and January 2018.   
   Nationstar filed a motion to confirm the sale,  
requesting that “rent on the Property collected by the 
Commissioner, if any, shall be paid to Plaintiff . . . , which 
sum shall be credited against the amounts due Plaintiff under its Note and Mortgage.”  AOAO again opposed the request for 
                                                 
commissions, cleaning and repair expenses for the 
unit, and general excise taxes paid on rental 
income; 
provided that the lien for delinquent assessments under paragraph (1) shall be paid, credited, or reimbursed first. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
6 
 rents, arguing that it was entitled to any rent collected up 
until the foreclosure sale.5   
   At the confirmation hearing, the circuit court 
disagreed that AOAO was entitled to the rents, and directed the 
Commissioner to pay all the funds in his possession to 
Nationstar.  The Commissioner testified that in addition to the 
$3,200 in rents from November 2017 to January 2018, he had 
collected $1,000 in rent each month for February, March, and 
April, for a total of $6,200.  The court entered an order 
confirming the foreclosure sale on May 16, 2018.  Regarding rents, it denied AOAO’s request for rental proceeds and ordered 
the rent be paid to Nationstar.  AOAO filed a timely notice of 
appeal from the circuit court’s judgment and order.   
Before the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA), AOAO 
made a number of arguments as to why it retained legal and 
equitable title until after the foreclosure sale was confirmed.
First, it argued that per the lien theory of mortgages, Nationstar had only a lien against the property until it was 
actually sold.  AOAO cited HRS § 506-1(a) (Supp. 2015), which   
                                                 
5  Alternatively, AOAO requested that, if the circuit court denied 
its request for rents, Nationstar be required to pay AOAO maintenance and 
reserve fees from June 30, 2017 – the date of the entry of summary judgment – 
to the sale’s closing.  The court stated that it would consider its request 
once AOAO submitted a ledger of what it was owed.  While AOAO did submit a 
ledger, in its order confirming the foreclosure sale, the court did not 
address AOAO’s alternate request for assessments.

 provides that a mortgage “shall create a lien only as security 
for the obligation and shall not be deemed to pass title.”  In 
the condominium context, HRS § 514B-146(b) (Supp. 2015)  provides 
that a mortgagee does not acquire title in a judicial foreclosure 
until after the confirmation of sale.   6
 Second, AOAO argued that HRS § 667-102(b)(4) (Supp. 
2013) provides that once an “affidavit and the conveyance 
document are recorded” in a nonjudicial foreclosure, “[t]he 
purchaser shall be entitled to immediate and exclusive 
possession of the unit.”  Thus, the circuit court erred by 
                                                 
6  HRS § 514B-146(b) provides in relevant part: 
 
Except as provided in subsection (j), when the 
mortgagee of a mortgage of record or other purchaser of a 
unit obtains title to the unit as a result of foreclosure of 
the mortgage, the acquirer of title and the acquirer’s 
successors and assigns shall not be liable for the share of 
the common expenses or assessments by the association 
chargeable to the unit that became due prior to the 
acquisition of title to the unit by the acquirer.  The 
unpaid share of common expenses or assessments shall be 
deemed to be common expenses collectible from all of the 
unit owners, including the acquirer and the acquirer’s 
successors and assigns.  The mortgagee of record or other 
purchaser of the unit shall be deemed to acquire title and shall be required to pay the unit’s share of common expenses 
and assessments beginning: 
(1) Thirty- six days after the order confirming the 
sale to the purchaser has been filed with the court; 
(2) Sixty days after the hearing at which the court 
grants the motion to confirm the sale to the purchaser; 
(3) Thirty days after the public sale in a 
nonjudicial power of sale foreclosure conducted pursuant to chapter 667; or 
(4) Upon the recording of the instrument of 
conveyance; 
whichever occurs first[.] 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

  awarding the Commissioner legal and equitable title via the 
summary judgment order when AOAO was entitled to possession.  
Even if the circuit court had the equitable power to override 
AOAO’s statutory right to exclusive possession and rents, to do 
so in this case would be inequitable, because while AOAO would have to burden other, non-defaulting owners with its losses, 
Nationstar “would be fully compensated upon the foreclosure 
sale.”   
  
 Next, AOAO turned to its arguments regarding HRS § 
514B-146(n).  That statute “contemplates [AOAO] receiving rental 
income” after the foreclosure judgment as it “provides twice 
that rent shall ‘be received by the association.’”  Thus, the only instance in which Nationstar would be entitled to rental 
income is if excess rental income exists, computed as the amount 
of post-foreclosure rents “received by the association” after deducting the items listed in subsections (n)(1) to (4).
7   
   In response, Nationstar argued that the circuit court 
properly distributed the rental income according to lien 
priority.  It pointed to HRS § 667-102(b)(3) (Supp. 2013), which 
provides that an association’s lien is “automatically 
                                                 
7  Last, AOAO argued “[i]n the alternative and as a matter of 
equity,” that it was entitled to common expenses assessed while the 
Commissioner was in possession.  According to AOAO,  “[i]t would be wholly 
inequitable to require [AOAO] to be responsible for the burdens of ownership 
. . . while simultaneously giving all of the benefits of ownership to the 
Commissioner for the eventual benefit of [Nationstar].”   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
9 
 extinguished” when the association completes a foreclosure.  It 
also pointed to HRS §§ 667-3 and 667-10 (Supp. 2013), which 
provide that proceeds of a mortgage sale are distributed first 
to lien holders according to priority and then to the prior 
owner.   
  Further, Nationstar disputed AOAO’s interpretation of 
HRS § 514B-146(n).  Nationstar argued that this statute creates an entitlement to post-foreclosure rents for senior mortgagees, 
not associations.  Nationstar claimed AOAO already recouped the delinquencies left over from the Davids, and AOAO had no 
maintenance costs following summary judgment as the Commissioner 
took possession.
8  This reading “harmonizes” HRS § 514B-146 with 
HRS §§ 667-3 and 667-10.   
   The ICA rejected AOAO’s arguments and affirmed the 
circuit court’s order confirming the foreclosure sale.  First, 
it held that AOAO did not state how the circuit court “vested 
the Commissioner with title to the [unit].”  The circuit court’s foreclosure decree directed the Commissioner to take possession 
and control of the property, but it had not vested title in him.   
                                                 
8  The AOAO alleged that the Davids left $34,002.57 in assessment 
arrears, recoverable under HRS § 514B- 146(n)(1).  However,  the record does 
not indicate the amount AOAO was able to collect in rents from the property 
prior to the appointment of the C ommissioner.  Nationstar claims that this 
pre-foreclosure rental income exceeded the sum of the delinquencies, and that 
the AOAO is therefore not entitled to the $6,200 in post- foreclosure rents.   
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
10 
     Second, the ICA concluded that AOAO’s argument that it 
was entitled to rent after the entry of the foreclosure decree 
was without merit .  For the reasons stated in U.S. Bank Tr., 
N.A. v. Chinen, 150 Hawai ‘i 573, 583-84, 506 P.3d 869, 879-80 
(App. 2022), the ICA concluded that the circuit court did not abuse its equitable discretion in ordering that the rents collected by the Commissioner be turned over to Nationstar.
9   
  AOAO filed a timely application for writ of 
certiorari, arguing that the ICA erred by holding it was not entitled to rents.  It reasserted that summary judgment does not extinguish the foreclosed owners’ rights to possession because, per HRS §§ 514B-146(b) and (l),
10 a mortgage lender’s foreclosure 
of an already-foreclosed condo is not complete until after the 
confirmation judgment.  
  Next, AOAO expanded on its interpretation of HRS § 
514B-146(n).  It explained that in 2013 the legislature amended HRS § 514B-146(n) to “specify how excess rental income received 
                                                 
9  With regard to AOAO’s argument that the circuit court should have 
ordered the C ommissioner to pay the condo assessments accrued during the 
foreclosure to AOAO, the ICA held that the circuit court’s failure to award 
AOAO this relief was not an abuse of discretion.   
 
10 As relevant here, HRS § 514B- 146(i)(1) (Supp. 2018) defines the 
“completion” of the foreclosure as the recording of an affidavit in a non-
judicial foreclosure pursuant to HRS chapter 667 or, in a judicial 
foreclosure, when the purchaser is deemed to acquire title under HRS § 514B-
146(b). 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
11 
 by a condominium association after a foreclosure proceeding 
shall be paid to existing lien holders.”  (Quoting Conf. Comm. 
Rep. No. 57, in 2013 House Journal, at 1539, 2013 Senate 
Journal, at 799) (emphasis added).)  The conference committee 
report also indicated a desire to balance the interests of 
condominium associations, mortgagors, and the lending industry.11   
   AOAO further argued that the ICA’s interpretation of 
HRS § 514B-146(n) rendered it superfluous.  If an association’s 
interest is foreclosed by summary judgment and a commissioner is 
normally given possession and control in foreclosure, “then there is no situation where the [a]ssociation will ever receive 
rents following a mortgagee’s foreclosure and there will never 
be a situation where excess rents are found to exist.”
12   
In response, Nationstar argued that AOAO misinterpreted 
HRS § 514B-146(n).  Rather than entitling AOAO to possession, 
“the statute mandates that Nationstar be paid any net rental 
income received by AOAO after the Foreclosure Judgment.”  It 
                                                 
11  AOAO further quoted language from the conference committee 
report that substantially tracked the language of subsection (n), namely by 
providing that “any excess rental income received by a condominium association 
after a foreclosure proceeding shall be applied to the benefit of the unit 
owner” and defining excess rental income as “net income received by the 
association after  a court has issued a final judgment determining the priority 
of a senior mortgagee.”  (Quoting Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 57, at 2013 House 
Journal, at 1539, 2013 Senate Journal, at 799-800 (emphasis added).)    
 
12  Additionally, AOAO repeated its argument that for any months that
Nationstar is awarded rent, it should be credited for common assessments.    
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
12 
 repeated that AOAO had already recouped its delinquencies and 
that it incurred no upkeep costs after the foreclosure – as the 
Commissioner was in possession – and therefore was not entitled 
to any rents collected after the summary judgment.   
  Next, Nationstar quoted Bank of N.Y. Mellon v. Larrua, 
150 Hawai ‘i 429, 431, 504 P.3d 1017, 1019 (App. 2022), for the 
proposition that a foreclosure decree is a “final determination 
of a foreclosed party’s ownership interests in the subject 
property.”  In Larrua, as here, a lender foreclosed following an 
association’s13 previous foreclosure, and the circuit court 
appointed a commissioner to collect rents, which it later awarded to the lender.  Id. at 431-33, 38, 504 P.3d 1019-21.  
There, the ICA explained that the foreclosure decree extinguished the association’s interests, and, even though legal 
title did not immediately pass, the circuit court had the 
equitable power to appoint a commissioner to take possession.  
Id. at 440, 504 P.3d at 1028.  So here, AOAO’s interest was 
extinguished by summary judgment.   
                                                 
13 The defendant association in Larrua was the Association of 
Apartment Owners of Elima Lani Condominiums, the petitioner/defendant-
appellant here.  Id. at 431, 504 P.3d at 1019.

 III.  STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
 A. Statutory Interpretation 
 “Questions of statutory interpretation are questions 
of law to be reviewed de novo under the right/wrong standard.”  
Guth v. Freeland, 96 Hawai ‘i 147, 149–50, 28 P.3d 982, 984–85 
(2001). 
B. Foreclosure Actions 
  Foreclosure is an equitable action.  “ Courts of 
equity have the power to mold their decrees to conserve the 
equities of the parties under the circumstances of the 
case.”  A court sitting in equity in a foreclosure case has 
the plenary power to fashion a decree to conform to the 
equitable requirements of the situation.  Whether and to 
what extent relief should be granted rests within the sound 
discretion of the court and will not be disturbed absent an 
abuse of such discretion.  
 
Peak Cap. Grp., LLC v. Perez, 141 Hawai ‘i 160, 172, 407 P.3d 116, 
128 (2017) (citations omitted) (quoting Honolulu, Ltd. v. 
Blackwell, 7 Haw. App. 210, 219, 750 P.2d 942, 948 (App. 1988)). 
  A circuit court sitting in foreclosure abuses its 
equitable discretion “by issuing a decision that clearly exceeds 
the bounds of reason or disregard[s] rules or principles of law 
or practice to the substantial detriment of the appellant.”

 IV. DISCUSSION 
 
 This application requires us to answer two questions: 
(1) whether, under our precedents, a foreclosed owner (in this 
case, the association) is entitled to exclusive possession and 
rents after the entry of summary judgment and an interlocutory decree of foreclosure, but prior to the confirmation of sale; 
and (2) if not, whether HRS § 514B-146(n) entitles the 
association to rents accruing during this period, or some 
portion of them, notwithstanding our precedents.   
   With respect to the first question, the ICA and 
Nationstar are correct that AOAO’s right to possession was 
terminated by the foreclosure judgment.
14  We have long 
maintained that “[a] judgment of foreclosure of mortgage or 
other lien and sale of foreclosed property is final . . . on the 
ground that such judgment finally determines the merits of the controversy . . . .”  MDG Supply, Inc. v. Diversified Invs., 
Inc., 51 Haw. 375, 380, 463 P.2d 525, 528 (1969).  Unless 
provided otherwise by statute, AOAO was not entitled to rent or 
possession after the circuit court entered summary judgment in 
favor of Nationstar.   
                                                 
14  The court granted Nationstar’s motion for summary judgment, and 
issued a judgment of foreclosure against AOAO.  The term “ judgment of 
foreclosure” refers to the final determination in a judicial foreclosure 
proceeding, whether it is entered upon summary judgment or otherwise ( for 
example, upon the defendant’s default, or after trial) .  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
15 
  
  As to HRS § 514B-146(n), the statute entitles 
associations to continue receiving rent after a subsequent 
mortgage foreclosure, even if a commissioner is appointed, 
subject to paying any rent received in excess of the total 
amount of the reimbursements enumerated in HRS § 514B-146(n)(1)-(4) over to the lienholders in order of priority.  Nationstar’s 
argument that rents received by a commissioner are not “received 
by the association” under the statute would result in the 
statute having no practical effect.  Therefore, further 
proceedings are necessary to determine if AOAO was entitled to 
all or some portion of the rent collected after a commissioner 
was appointed. 
A. A Foreclosure Judgment Extinguishes the Prior Owner’s Right 
to Possession, and a Commissioner May Take Possession Prior to a Foreclosure Sale  
1. A foreclosure judgment is a final judgment 
extinguishing the prior owner’s right to possession 
  AOAO argues that because it owned the property, it 
should have been allowed to continue to hold possession and 
collect rent until a foreclosure sale was confirmed – that is, after the foreclosure judgment.  The ICA in this case relied on 
Larrua.  In Larrua, the ICA determined: 
[U]nder Hawai ‘i law, it is well- established that a 
judgment entered on a foreclosure decree is a final 
determination of the parties’ rights in the subject property –
 in other words, the property owners’ rights in the 
property are foreclosed, notwithstanding that further proceedings are necessary to enforce and otherwise *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
16 
 effectuate the foreclosure decree and judgment. 
 
150 Hawai ‘i at 439, 504 P.3d at 1027.   
  The ICA is correct: the foreclosure judgment was a 
final judgment that cut off AOAO’s right to possession.  AOAO 
was therefore not entitled to continue collecting rent. 
  We have held that “[a] judgment of foreclosure of 
mortgage or other lien and sale of foreclosed property is final, 
although it contains a direction to commissioners to make a 
report of sale and to bring the proceeds into court for an order 
regarding their disposition.”  MDG Supply, 51 Haw. at 380, 463 
P.2d at 528.  This is because such a judgment “finally 
determines the merits of the controversy, and subsequent 
proceedings are simply incidents to its enforcement.”15  Id.; see 
also 55 Am. Jur. 2d Mortgages § 592 (2023) (“A mortgage-
foreclosure decree is a final judgment even though it creates a 
right to redeem.”).  Thus, we have analogized a confirmation-of-
sale proceeding to a “traditional ‘action upon a judgment’” in 
that it merely “‘facilitate[s] the goal of securing satisfaction

  Here, then, AOAO’s right to possession was terminated 
when the court adjudged its interest foreclosed.   
2. A mortgagee may seek the appointment of a commissioner 
to cut off the prior owner’s possession 
  AOAO further argues that the appointment of a 
commissioner with authority to take possession and collect rent 
was in error because AOAO is entitled to the “benefits of 
ownership” until a foreclosure sale.  (Emphasis omitted.)  In 
support, AOAO cited  HRS § 514B-146(b), which provides that a 
mortgagee does not acquire title in a judicial foreclosure until 
after the confirmation of sale.  However, Hawai ‘i courts may 
authorize a commissioner to take possession and collect rents 
where the collateral is inadequate to satisfy a mortgagee.  HRS § 514B-146(b) establishes when a mortgagee or other 
purchaser must begin paying common expenses and assessments; it 
does not address the propriety of appointing a commissioner to 
take possession of the property and facilitate the foreclosure 
sale after the prior owner’s interest has been deemed 
foreclosed.  Larrua, 150 Hawai ‘i at 441-42, 504 P.3d at 1029-30.   
  The appointment of a commissioner or a receiver is an 
equitable remedy designed to preserve the status quo and protect
a lender’s collateral.  “There is no doubt of the inherent power  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

Hawai ‘i 573, 582, 506 P.3d 869, 878 (App. 2022) (holding that
the appointment of a commissioner upon entry of foreclosure 
judgment was “consistent with the Circuit Court’s equitable powers and standard practices”).  The appointment of a 
commissioner is an appropriate remedy where the security for a 
mortgage appears to be inadequate:  “A court may exercise its 
equity jurisdiction in appointing a receiver if there is danger 
that the property will be insufficient security for the debt 
. . . .”  4 Richard R. Powell, Powell on Real Property § 
37.26[4][c], at 37 -175 (2022) (emphasis added).  
 
  The United States Supreme Court has confirmed that the 
foreclosed owner may continue in possession until its right of 
occupancy is cut off by a court-appointed receiver:  “[T]he 
general rule is that the mortgagee is not entitled to the rents 
                                                 
16 Hawai ‘i Rules of Civ il Procedure (HRCP) Rule 66 (2018) preserves 
this authority: “The practice in the administration of estates by receivers or 
by other similar officers appointed by the court shall be in accordance with 
the practice heretofore followed.” *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 and profits of the mortgaged premises until he takes actual 
possession, or until possession is taken in his behalf by a 
receiver, or until, in proper form, he demands, and is refused, 
possession[.]”  Freedman’s Saving & Tr. Co. v. Shepherd, 127 
U.S. 494, 502–03 (1888) (emphasis added) (citations omitted).  
This is because “[p]ossession draws after it the right to 
receive and apply the income.”  Gilman v. Ill. & Miss. Tel. Co., 
91 U.S. 603, 617 (1875).   
  Other jurisdictions have held that a prior owner or 
other tenant is entitled to possession and rents until the court appoints a commissioner.  See, e.g., United States v. Am. Nat’l 
Bank & Tr. Co., 573 F. Supp. 1319, 1321–22 (N.D. Ill. 1983) 
(“Illinois law does hold that a mortgagor is entitled to rents collected from the mortgaged property until the mortgagee or 
receiver takes possession of the property . . . .”); Hoelting 
Enters. v. Trailridge Invs., L.P., 844 P.2d 745, 749–50 (Kan. 
Ct. App. 1993) (“[A] purely executory agreement alone is not 
effective to vest in a mortgagee the right to rents and profits.

if . . . the mortgagor defaults and the court appoints a 
receiver . . . .” (citation omitted)); cf. Schmalzl v. Peretta, 
276 N.Y.S. 224, 225 (N.Y. App. Div. 1934) (per curiam) (holding 
that a mortgagee was not owed rents collected during foreclosure 
where they did not demand possession of the premises).  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
20 
   In support, AOAO cited  HRS § 514B-146(b), which 
provides that a mortgagee does not acquire title in a judicial 
foreclosure until after the confirmation of sale.  However, the 
ICA was correct to hold in Larrua that HRS § 514B-146(b) simply 
establishes when a mortgagee or other purchaser must begin 
paying common expenses and assessments.  150 Hawai ‘i at 441-42, 
504 P.3d at 1029-30.  HRS § 514B-146(b) does not preclude 
appointment of a commissioner to take possession of the property 
and facilitate the foreclosure sale after the prior owner’s 
interest has been deemed foreclosed.  Id. 
  In sum, the appointment of a commissioner is an 
equitable remedy that cuts off the prior owner’s possession and 
right to collect rent.  Although the circuit court stated that 
the Commissioner would become the title owner of the unit, this was incorrect; the Commissioner is a neutral arm of the court 
holding the property on the court’s behalf.   In any case, 
however, AOAO’s arguments that it was entitled to continue to possess the unit to the exclusion of the Commissioner are 
mistaken.   
B. HRS § 514B-146(n) Implicitly Abrogated the Common Law and 
Provided for Associations to Receive Post-Foreclosure Rent 
  AOAO claims it is entitled to rents by virtue of HRS § 
514B-146(n), which “contemplates the [a]ssociation receiving 
rental income from the [p]roperty following the issuance of a *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
21 
  foreclosure decree.”  Because HRS § 514B-146(n) twice mentions 
“income received by the association,” AOAO argues it 
affirmatively grants associations the right to receive rents 
“after a court has issued a final judgment determining the 
priority of a senior mortgagee.”  Thus, AOAO should have received all rents collected by the Commissioner except to the 
extent they can be shown to be “excess rental income.”   
  The ICA rejected this view, relying on its decisions 
in Larrua and Chinen.  In Larrua, the ICA held that HRS § 514B-
146(n) “addresses only how an AOAO must utilize any rental income it receives after its own foreclosure on the unit, when 
its interest is subsequently foreclosed upon by a mortgagee.”  
150 Hawai ‘i at 444, 504 P.3d at 1032.  The ICA concluded that 
“while the statutory language [of HRS § 514B-146(n)] may 
contemplate the AOAO receiving rental income from a unit after 
the entry of a foreclosure decree and judgment, it does not go 
so far as entitling the AOAO to such income.”17  Id. 
 We disagree.  The statute authorizes an AOAO’s receipt 
of post-foreclosure rents and entitles the association to those 
rents up to the sum of the amounts in subsections (1)-(4).  
HRS § 514B-146(n) reads: 
                                                 
17 In Chinen, the ICA relied on Larrua to reject an association’s 
claim for rents based on HRS § 514B- 146(n).  150 Hawai ‘i at 584, 506 P.3d at 
880. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
22 
 After any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure 
proceeding in which the association acquires title to the 
unit, any excess rental income received by the association 
from the unit shall be paid to existing lien holders based on the priority of lien, and not on a pro rata basis, and 
shall be applied to the benefit of the unit owner.  For 
purposes of this subsection, excess rental income shall be any net income received by the association after a court has 
issued a final judgment determining the priority of a senior mortgagee and after paying, crediting, or reimbursing the 
association or a third party for: 
 
(1) The lien for delinquent assessments pursuant to 
subsections (a) and (b);  
(2) Any maintenance fee delinquency against the unit; 
 
(3) Attorney's fees and other collection costs 
related to the association’s foreclosure of the 
unit; or 
 
(4) Any costs incurred by the association for the rental, repair, maintenance, or rehabilitation of the unit while the association is in 
possession of the unit including monthly 
association maintenance fees, management fees, 
real estate commissions, cleaning and repair 
expenses for the unit, and general excise taxes paid on rental income; 
  
provided that the lien for delinquent assessments under 
paragraph (1) shall be paid, credited, or reimbursed first. 
  
  The first clause provides that the statute only 
applies after an association has foreclosed.  Id.  The second 
clause provides that “excess rental income” shall be paid to 
senior lien holders by priority, to be applied for “the benefit 
of the unit owner.”  Id.  In context, it is clear that “the unit 
owner” refers to the owner prior to the association, on whom the 
association foreclosed.  See HRS § 514B-146(a) (Supp. 2015) 
(allowing the association, during its foreclosure, to collect a “reasonable rental” from “the unit owner”).   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
23 
   In the second sentence of HRS § 514B-146(n), the words 
“final judgment determining the priority of a senior mortgagee” 
can only refer to a summary judgment and/or interlocutory decree 
of foreclosure, which, as discussed, is a “final judgment” under 
our precedent.  See Peer News LLC v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 
138 Hawai ‘i 53, 69, 376 P.3d 1, 17 (2016) (“The legislature is 
presumed to know the law when it enacts statutes, including this court’s decisions . . . .”).  Prior to such a judgment, the 
association’s interest is unaffected.  And the clause “after 
paying, crediting, or reimbursing the association or a third 
party” indicates that the AOAO or a third party — i.e., whomever 
is owed the costs enumerated in subsections (1) through (4) — 
will receive post-foreclosure rents up to the total amount of 
those costs.  
  Read literally, HRS § 514B-146(n) only applies when 
the rents are “received” by the association; arguably that would not be the case if a commissioner is appointed and authorized to 
collect rent.  However, we interpret HRS § 514B-146(n) to apply 
to rental income received by the association after a mortgagee’s 
subsequent foreclosure, whether or not a commissioner is 
appointed.  The statute entitles the association to such income, however collected, but only to the extent it does not exceed the 
sum of the amounts listed in subsections (1) through (4).  This 
statutory scheme thus replaces the equitable distribution that *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
24 
 our case law formerly required in cases where a commissioner was 
appointed.   
 
 This result is necessary for HRS § 514B-146(n) to have 
any logical effect.  Appointment of a commissioner is common in 
foreclosures where the security is inadequate to satisfy a mortgage debt because it has substantial procedural advantages for the mortgagor.
18  If the appointment of a commissioner 
required that rent be awarded to the party that requested 
appointment notwithstanding HRS § 514B-146(n), the statute would 
only have practical effect in the very small number of cases where the mortgagor failed to have a commissioner appointed by 
the court.  As argued by AOAO: “[u]nder the ICA’s 
interpretation, HRS § [514B-146(n)] is superfluous.  If at the 
summary judgment stage, the Association’s interest is 
‘foreclosed’ and a commissioner who is appointed is always given 
possession and control of the Property—including the rents, then 
there is no situation where the Association will ever receive rents following a mortgagee’s foreclosure and there will never 
be a situation where excess rents are found to exist.”  We 
                                                 
18  “[T]he commissioner takes possession of the mortgaged property 
and preserves the property for the benefit of the person or entity 
subsequently entitled to it.”  Larrua, 150 Hawaiʻ i at 440, 504 P.3d at 1028; 
see also 1 Real Estate Finance Law § 4:33 (6th ed. 2016) (explaining that 
when foreclosing on properties, mortgagees generally prefer to seek 
appointment of a commissioner rather than obtaining possession themselves — 
even when the latter remedy is available — because it mitigates the need for 
an ejectment action, avoids accounting responsibilities, and insulates the 
mortgagor from tort liability).   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
25 
 hesitate to read HRS § 514B-146(n) to apply only in this highly 
unusual scenario.   
  The legislative history of HRS § 514B-146(n) supports 
this reading.  The bill that enacted subsection (n) was a 
compromise between lenders and associations.  The legislature found that “the costs of default in a condominium are 
substantially born by condominium associations and non-
defaulting unit owners” and that “the needs of the lending 
industry and condominium associations and non-defaulting unit 
owners must be appropriately balanced . . . .”  Conf. Comm. Rep. 
No. 57, in 2013 House Journal, at 1539, 2013 Senate Journal, at 
799.  “This measure achieves this balance by providing condominium associations and non-defaulting unit owners with 
relief while also addressing interests of the lending industry.”  
Id.  Indeed, an earlier version of the bill that enacted 
subsection (n) also provided an unlimited super-priority lien to associations for unpaid assessments, but the legislature 
eventually settled on a six-month lien.  Compare H.B. 21, H.D. 
1, 27th Leg., Reg. Sess. (2013), with 2013 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 
196, § 1 at 629.   
  Thus, in enacting HRS § 514B-146(n), the legislature 
intended for a foreclosing association to be able to collect what it was due and no more; hence, the association is to 
receive all rents short of “excess rental income.”  Accordingly, *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
26 
 the statute calls for an accounting to take place upon 
confirmation.  The association must account for all rents from 
the time it foreclosed on the property.  If this amount exceeds 
the sum of the assessment and maintenance delinquencies, the 
costs of foreclosure, and the maintenance fees that accrued while the association was in possession, the AOAO is not 
entitled to retain rents accruing after the foreclosure.  
However, if it still faces a shortfall even after the rent it 
collected, it may continue to collect rent short of “excess 
rental income.”  HRS § 514B-146(n).  When a commissioner is in 
possession, the commissioner collects and holds the rent on 
behalf of the court, which will ultimately be distributed upon confirmation of the sale according to HRS § 514B-146(n).  
  This interpretation gives meaning to the common 
understanding of the word “excess” as “the state of . . . 
surpassing usual, proper, or specified limits.”  Excess, 
Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary (11th ed. 2003).  “[E]xcess rental income” is income collected by an association 
above and beyond what it was owed by the prior owners and the 
costs it incurred.  There is no reason for the association to 
retain this amount while a mortgagee goes unpaid.  Thus, it is truly “excess” and must be paid to mortgagees to avoid creating 
an improper windfall for associations at the lenders’ expense. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
27 
   One final interpretative problem arises.  HRS § 514B-
146(a) provides that “[a]ll sums assessed by the association but 
unpaid for the share of the common expenses chargeable to any 
unit shall constitute a lien,” and HRS § 514B-146(n)(1) allows 
the association to be paid, credited, or reimbursed for that lien before turning over any excess rental income.  But where an 
association completes the HRS Chapter 667 power-of-sale 
foreclosure process, HRS § 667-102(b)(3) provides that “[t]he 
lien of the association . . . shall be automatically 
extinguished from the unit.”  Nationstar argues that because 
AOAO’s lien was “automatically extinguished” under HRS §  
667-102(b)(3) upon foreclosure, it could not have any entitlement to post-foreclosure rents.  Nationstar further 
argues that under HRS §§ 667-3 and 667-10, proceeds from a 
foreclosure sale must first be distributed to the unpaid loan 
secured by the mortgage, with any remaining surplus distributed 
next to junior lienholders in order of priority, then to the 
owner, deducting any outstanding expenses owed.  
However, HRS §§ 514B-146(n), 514B-146(a), and 667-
102(b) can be reconciled.  “[W]here there is a ‘plainly 
irreconcilable’ conflict between a general and a specific statute concerning the same subject matter, the specific will be 
favored.  However, where the statutes simply overlap in their 
application, effect will be given to both if possible, as repeal *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
28 
  by implication is disfavored.”  Richardson v. City & Cnty. of 
Honolulu, 76 Hawai‘ i 46, 55, 868 P.2d 1193, 1202 (1994) (quoting 
Mahiai v. Suwa, 69 Haw. 349, 356–57, 742 P.2d 359, 366 (1987)).   
HRS § 667-102(b) applies generally to association 
foreclosures, whether or not a lender subsequently forecloses.  
However, HRS § 514B-146(n) applies specifically to rent received 
“after a court has issued a final judgment determining the priority of a senior mortgagee.”  Thus, while HRS § 667-
102(b)(3) generally extinguishes the association’s lien, this 
lien continues to exist solely for the purposes of the 
accounting in HRS § 514B-146(n), and the association may be 
paid, credited, or reimbursed for it.
19   
HRS §§ 667-3 and 667-10 generally govern how proceeds 
should be distributed among lien holders following a foreclosure 
sale.  HRS § 514B-146(n) specifically governs rents collected by 
an AOAO after a foreclosure sale and before confirmation.  Rather than a strict allocation according to the priority of the 
lien under HRS §§ 667-3 and 667-10, these rents should be 
allocated according to HRS § 514B-146(n)(1)-(4).   
                                                 
19 As for the provision that the lien for delinquent assessments 
“shall be paid, credited, or reimbursed first,” this provision merely directs 
that the association must first apply the rental income it receives to reduce 
the prior owner’s continuing liability to it.  HRS § 514B- 146(n).   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
29 
   In sum, HRS § 514B-146(n) created a scheme to divide 
post-foreclosure rents whether or not a commissioner is 
appointed, with the association retaining everything up to 
“excess rental income.”  We remand to the circuit court to apply 
this interpretation.20 
V. CONCLUSION 
   For the foregoing reasons, the circuit court’s May 16, 
2018 confirmation judgment and the ICA’s May 2, 2022 Judgment on 
Appeal are vacated with regard to the allocation of rents 
collected by the Commissioner.  This case is remanded to the 
circuit court for further proceedings specifically to determine 
what portion of the rents collected by the Commissioner after 
the circuit court’s June 30, 2017 Findings of Fact, Conclusions 
of Law and Order Granting Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment Against AOAO constituted excess rental income pursuant 
to HRS § 514B-146(n).  Per that statute, AOAO is entitled to 
receive any portion of those rents that do not constitute excess 
rental income. 
                                                 
20  Because HRS § 514B- 146(n) displaces the equitable principles that 
would normally govern allocation of rent in a proceeding where a commissioner 
is appointed, we do not reach AOAO’s argument that the circuit court should 
have considered its request to be awarded the association fees that accrued while the C ommissioner was in possession.  However, we note as a general 
principle that where HRS § 514B- 146(n) does not apply, a circuit court should 
consider the equities and allocate rents accordingly.  Although rents 
collected by a foreclosure commissioner will normally be awarded to the 
secured party for whose benefit the proceeding was instituted, in some cases 
equity may require a different result.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
