ORDER DENYING “MOTION TO RECONSIDER” 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.) 
On June 12, 2019, petitioner/claimant-appellant Dwight J. 
Vicente filed a “Motion to Reconsider,” in which he asks this 
court to reconsider the June 5, 2019 order rejecting his application for writ of certiorari.  A rejection of an application for writ of certiorari, however, is not subject to reconsideration.  See HRAP Rule 40.1(h) (“Neither acceptance nor rejection of an application for a writ of certiorari shall be subject to a motion for reconsideration in the supreme court. 
The rejection of an application for certiorari shall be final.”). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the “Motion to Reconsider” is 
denied. 
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, June 20, 2019.
