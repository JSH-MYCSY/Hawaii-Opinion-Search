2 Appeals (ICA) affirming the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit’s2 
(circuit court) denial of two of Marroquin’s motions in limine  
to offer hearsay evidence.  On certiorari, Marroquin raises a 
single point of error and argues that the ICA erred by 
concluding that the circuit court may deny a motion in limine 
without providing findings of fact on the record, contrary to 
Hawaiʻi Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 12(e).  In 
particular, Marroquin challenges the ICA’s conclusion that trial 
judges “should,” but need not, make findings of fact on the 
record when resolving motions in limine.  
Contrary to Marroquin’s argument, HRPP Rule 12(e) does 
not govern motions in limine.  Rather, Hawai ʻi Rules of Evidence 
(HRE) Rule 103(b) is the specific  standard governing the 
admissibility of evidence and the motions in limine .  HRE Rule 
103(b) explicitl y provides discretion to  trial courts resolving 
evidentiary issues regarding whether to make findings of fact.  
Therefore, we agree with the ICA’s ultimate conclusion that the 
circuit court did not err in denying Marroquin’s motions in 
limine without enter ing findings of fact on the record.  We 
consequently affirm the ICA’s August  9, 2019 Judgment on Appeal 
on different grounds.  
                                                 
2  The Honorable Ronald Ibarra presided.

3 I.  BACKGROUND  
A. Factual Background  
On January 13, 2016, Marroquin was involved in an 
altercation with the complaining witness (the CW) at a 
construction site.  During the altercation, Marroquin punched 
the CW in the face at least three to five times.  Marroquin’s 
punches rendered the CW unconscious, “caved in” the CW’s right 
cheek, caused brain injury, and required facial reconstructi on 
surgery to install four plates and twenty screws.  Marroquin 
claimed that he punched the CW in self -defense because the CW 
grabbed Marroquin by the neck during the altercation.  
B. Pre-Trial Proceedings  
Marroquin filed two motions in limine relevant to 
certiorari. 
Marroquin’s Third Motion in Limine (Third MIL) 
requested permission to offer a hearsay statement from an 
eyewitness through the testimony of Officer Scott Aloy (Officer 
Aloy).3  In particular, Marroquin sought to offer testimony 
reflecting Officer Aloy’s notes that the eyewitness  
saw two guys arguing at which point he stated that he saw 
the guy dressed in the tank top4 swing at the other guy.  He 
stated that the haole guy put his hands around the neck of 
                                                 
3  Officer Aloy responded to a call regarding the altercation.  
 
4  Marroquin testified that he wore a tank top on the day of the 
altercation.  
  
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
4 the guy with the tank top and at that time, h e stated that 
he just saw the guy in the tank top keep punching the other 
guy in the face.  He then stated that the haole guy was 
then stuck in the corner and the guy in the tank top kept 
punching him while he was on the ground at which point I 
asked him w hich party swung first.  He stated that the guy 
in the tank top swung first and that he seemed to be the 
aggressor in this situation.  
 
Marroquin asserted that the eyewitness’s statement was relevant 
to his self -defense claim and admissible under HRE Rule 
804(b)(8).  
Marroquin’s Amended Fourth Motion in Limine (Fourth 
MIL) requested permission to offer hearsay -within-hearsay 
statements made by the CW to a co -worker through the testimony 
of Investigator Daniel Pang (Investigator Pang).5  Specifically, 
Marroqui n sought to offer testimony reflecting (1)  Investigator 
Pang’s notes that the CW told the co -worker that the CW “wasn’t 
going to take that from a punk like [Marroquin] and that [the 
CW] was going to call [Marroquin] out on it[;]” and (2)  a 
follow-up email from the co -worker to Investigator Pang stating:  
On January 13th of this year I showed up for work at the 
. . . residence.  I was talking with [Marroquin] around 8 
                                                 
5  Investigator Pang conducted follow -up investigations regarding the 
altercation.  
 
Marroquin’s Fourth MIL also indicated that he intended to introduce the 
CW’s statements to the c o-worker through another witness’s testimony.  
However, Marroquin’s motion focused solely on why he should be allowed to 
introduce the CW’s statements to the co -worker through Investigator Pang’s 
testimony.  This court “need not consider a point that was n ot presented in 
the trial court in an appropriate manner. ”  Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§ 641-2(b) (2004).  Inasmuch as Marroquin now argues that the ICA erred in 
affirming the circuit court’s decision to not admit the CW’s statements to 
the co-worker through another witness’s testimony, this court will disregard 
such a claim.  See id.  
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
5 am and [the CW] came over to ask a question.  [Marroquin] 
gave him a sarcastic answer and [t he CW] walked away angry.  
I went over to check and see if [the CW] needed anything 10 
minutes later and [the CW] was still upset and said he 
wasn’t going to take that from a punk like [Marroquin].  
[The CW] said he was going to call [Marroquin] out on it.   
I walked away and started working on what I was supposed to 
be doing that day and didn’t think much of it until 20 
minutes later when [Marroquin] came over to where [I] was 
working and said [the CW] grabbed [Marroquin] by the throat 
so [Marroquin] hit [t he CW].  I didn’t see the altercation.  
 
Marroquin asserted that the CW’s statement to the co -worker was 
relevant to his self -defense claim as it showed the CW’s state 
of mind, and admissible under HRE Rule 804(b)(8).  
The circuit court denied Marroquin’s Third and Fourth 
MILs.  In the circuit court’s written orders, the circuit court 
stated: 
The Court having considered the Motion; the State’s 
Opposition to Defendant’s Motion; the oral arguments of 
counsel; and the record and case -file herein shall DENY the  
Motion. 
C. Trial Proceedings  
During the trial, the CW testified that prior to the 
altercation, Marroquin responded to a question with an 
“aggressive” tone.  The CW explained that after this incident, 
“I was mad, you know, that I just got chewed out for nothing.”  
The CW added that “I vent[ed] to get it off my chest and move[d] 
on.”  About thirty or forty minutes later, the CW encountered 
Marroquin while looking for a drill.  The CW testified that 
Marroquin said “that he ought to just slap me” in an “elevated 
and . . . very aggressive t one.”  According to the CW, Marroquin  
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
6 struck him in the face and punched him multiple times, causing 
him to lose consciousness shortly after making the statement.  
The CW also stated that the CW “had a thought that if I could 
just grab him and hold onto hi m in a bear hug I could stop the 
madness.  But I never accomplished that.  Next thing I remember, 
I was on the ground.”  
On cross -examination, defense counsel asked the CW 
about the prior incident.  The CW reinforced that Marroquin’s 
tone was “[a]ggressive and demeaning.”  The CW also stated that 
“[w]ithin 30 seconds” of the interaction, “I stated my 
frustrations and I moved on.”  When asked why he was upset by 
the interaction, the CW responded “[t]he level and the -- the 
inflection.  It was aggressive, it w as demeaning.  It’s like he 
was talking down to me.”  Turning to the altercation itself, 
defense counsel asked the CW if “[a]t any point did you grab 
[Marroquin] by the neck?”  The CW replied “No.”  When asked if 
the CW tried to grab Marroquin during the a ltercation, the CW 
explained “I remember a thought of trying to grab him.  I 
remember trying to keep my balance and flailing my arms, and the 
next thing I remember I was on the ground.”  
On re-direct, the CW added that “I have no memory of 
laying my hands o n [Marroquin] at all.”   
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
7 (continued . . . )  After the prosecution rested, defense counsel renewed 
its Third MIL to introduce the eyewitness’s statement without 
providing any new evidence or arguments.  The circuit court 
denied the renewed motion, explaining “there’s still noth ing new 
that -- for the Court to consider.”  
During the defense’s case -in-chief, Marroquin also 
testified about the altercation.  Marroquin stated that the CW 
initiated the altercation by telling him “You shouldn’t be effin 
moving the drill.  I should slap you.”  Marroquin explained that 
the CW then “goes to make a motion.  I go to put up my hands.  I 
trip off the back of the lanai and he has me up against the wall 
by my neck.”  Marroquin emphasized that the CW “had me up 
against the wall by my neck and chok ing me out.”  Marroquin then 
testified that “I hit him.  He went down.  I got him off me.  I 
was like feared [sic] for my life.  He -- like had me, you know.  
He had me up by my throat on the wall and I couldn’t move.”  
Marroquin explained that after he managed to break free, “I made 
sure that he was down and didn’t get back up to attack me.”  
A jury subsequently found Marroquin guilty of Assault 
in the Second Degree6 on September 27, 2016.  The circuit court 
                                                 
6  The jury convicted Marroquin of violating HRS §  707-711(1) (2016), 
which provided in relevant part:  
 
Assault in the second degree. (1) A person commits the 
offense of assault in the second degree if:

8 entered its Judgment of Conviction and Sentence  on April 24, 
2018. 
D. The ICA’s Summary Disposition Order  
Marroquin appealed the circuit court’s Judgment of 
Conviction and Sentence to the ICA, which affirmed the circuit 
court.  The ICA concluded in a summary disposition order that a 
trial court “should,” but need not, provide factual findings in 
determining the admissibility of evidence.  
II.  STANDARD OF REVIEW  
 
A. Motions in Limine  
“The granting or denying of a motion in limine is 
reviewed for abuse of discretion.”  Kobashigawa v. Silva , 129 
Hawaiʻi 313, 320, 300 P.3d 579, 586 (2013).  “An abuse of 
discretion occurs ‘where the trial court has clearly exceeded 
the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles of law 
or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant.’”  
Carr v. Strode , 79 Hawai ʻi 475, 488, 904 P.2d 489, 503 (1995) 
                                                 
 (continued .  . .) 
 
 
(a)  The person intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly 
causes substantial bodily injury to another;  
 
(b)  The person recklessly causes serious bodily injury 
to another[.]

9 (quoting Amfac, Inc. v. Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co. , 74 Haw. 
85, 114, 839 P.2d 10, 26 (1992)).  
III.  DISCUSSION  
A. HRPP Rule 12(e) does not govern the motions in limine  at 
issue. 
Marroquin contends that HRPP Rule 12(e)7 governs the 
motions in limine here because he filed the motions before trial 
and the trial court’s determination on admissibility of hearsay 
evidence necessarily involved factual issues.  
This court disagrees.  HRE Rule 103(b) , the specific 
rule governing admission of evidence,  conflicts with HRPP Rule 
12(e), a general rule governing pretrial motions, and therefore 
precludes its application to motions in limine.  
The HRE govern the resolution of these motions in 
limine.  This court has approvingly  quoted the ICA’s explanation 
that a motion in limine “serves the useful purpose of raising 
and pointing out before trial certain evidentiary rulings the 
court may be called upon to make during the course of the 
                                                 
7  HRPP Rule 12(e) (2007) provides:  
 
(e) Ruling on Motion.  A motion made before trial shall 
be determined before trial unless the court orders that it 
be deferred for determination at the trial of the general 
issue or until after verdict; provided that a motion to 
suppress made before trial shall be determined before 
trial.  Where factual issues are involved in determining a 
motion, the court shall state its essential findings on the 
record.  
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
10 trial.”  Kobashigawa , 129 Hawai ʻi at 321, 300 P.3d at 587 
(quoting Lussier v. Mau -Van Dev., Inc. , 4 Haw. App. 359, 393, 
667 P.2d 804, 826 (1983)).  Given that motions in limine involve 
evidentiary issues, resolution of a motion in limine necessarily 
calls upon the trial court to apply the  HRE. 
HRE Rule 103(b) (1980) authorizes trial courts to 
resolve motions in limine without providing factual findings.  
“[W]here the statutory language is plain and unambiguous, our 
sole duty is to give effect to its plain and obvious meaning.”  
Citizens Ag ainst Reckless Dev. v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals , 114 
Hawaiʻi 184, 193, 159 P.3d 143, 152 (2007) (internal citation 
omitted).  HRE Rule 103(b) provides in relevant part: “[t]he 
[trial] court may add any other or further statement which shows 
the character o f . . . the ruling thereon.”  (E mphasis added .)  
The commentary to HRE Rule 103(b) adds that “[t]he intent [of 
HRE Rule 103(b)] is to provide the appellate court with a record 
adequate for final disposition of an evidentiary point.  The 
provision is discretio nary rather than mandatory, leaving 
determination of adequacy of record to the judgment of the trial 
court.”  The plain text of HRE Rule 103(b) consequently 
establishes that a trial court may provide findings of fact when 
resolving a motion in limine.   
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
11 HRPP Rule 12(e)’s factual finding requirement 
conflicts with HRE Rule 103(b)’s grant of discretionary 
authority.  The text of HRPP Rule 12(e) unambiguously requires 
that “[w]here factual issues are involved in determining a 
motion, the [trial] court shall state its essent ial findings on 
the record.”  (E mphasis added .)  However, HRE Rule 103(b) does 
not impose a strict mandate requiring trial courts to provide 
findings of fact to resolve a motion in limine.  Application of 
HRPP Rule 12(e) to motions in limin e would consequently deprive 
trial courts of the discretion granted by HRE Rule 103(b), and 
is therefore inconsistent with HRE Rule 103(b).  
HRE Rule 103(b) governs these  motions in limine.  The 
Legislature enacted the HRE in 1980, HRS §  626-1 (1980), and 
concurrently enacted HRS §  626-3 (1980), which provides that 
“[i]f any other provision of law, including any rule promulgated 
by the supreme court, is inconsistent with [the HRE], [the HRE] 
shall govern unless [the HRE] or such inconsistent provision of 
law specifically provides otherwise.”  
Neither the HRE nor the HRPP provides that the HRPP 
governs instead of  the HRE.  HRE Rule 1101 (1980) governs the 
applicability of the HRE.  HRE Rule 1101(b) explicitly provides 
that the HRE “apply generally to civil and criminal  
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
12 proceedings.”  HRE Rule 1101(d) adds in relevant part that the 
HRE do not apply to:  
(1) Prelimina ry questions of fact.  The determination of  
questions of fact preliminary to admissibility of 
evidence when the issue is to be determined by the 
court under rule 104.  
 
(2) Grand jury.  Proceedings before grand juries.  
 
(3) Miscellaneous proceedings.  Proce edings for extradition 
or rendition; preliminary hearings in criminal cases; 
sentencing, or granting or revoking probation; issuance 
of warrants for arrest, criminal summonses, and search 
warrants; and proceedings with respect to release on 
bail or otherwi se. 
 
(4) Small claims.  Proceedings before the small claims 
division of the district courts.  
 
  Meanwhile, the HRPP is silent at best on the issue of 
whether the HRPP or the HRE governs in case of a conflict .  HRPP 
Rule 1(b) (2012) governs the “Interpretation and Enforcement of 
[the HRPP].”  The rule provides that  
[t]hese rules shall be read and construed with reference to 
each other, the Hawai ʻi Electronic Filing and Service Rules, 
and the Hawai ʻi Court Records Rules.  In any conflict 
amongst t he Hawai ʻi Rules of Penal Procedure, the Hawai ʻi 
Court Records Rules, and the Hawai ʻi Electronic Filing and 
Service Rules, the Hawai ʻi Electronic Filing and Service 
Rules shall prevail.  
 
HRPP Rule 1(b).  
This court therefore holds that HRE Rule 103(b), and 
not HRPP Rule 12(e), governs  these motions in limine.  See HRS 
§ 626-3.  HRPP Rule 12(e)’s factual finding requirements 
therefore do not apply to the resolution of motions in limine.
