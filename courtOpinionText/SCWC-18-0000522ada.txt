degree, a class C felony. The defendant moved to dismiss the 
charge, arguing that his violation of the statute was so trivial 
that it did not warrant the condemnation of conviction.  The 
circuit court agreed, finding that the violation was de minimis and dismissing the charge.  On appeal, the Intermediate Court of 
Appeals (ICA) vacated the order dismissing the charge.  It 
concluded that the circuit court had erred in finding that the cocaine the defendant possessed could not have had any pharmacological or physiological effect upon consumption, and 
that this error required the order of dismissal to be vacated.  
The defendant sought certiorari review of the ICA’s decision.  We conclude that the ICA erred in holding that a defendant, in order to prevail on a motion to dismiss a possessory drug 
violation as de minimis, must prove that the possessed drugs 
could not have any pharmacological or physiological effect. Thus, the ICA’s vacatur of the dismissal order was erroneous. 
I. BACKGROUND 
A. General Overview 
On May 23, 2017, Pekelo K.K. Melendez was taken into 
custody at the Circuit Court of the First Circuit’s (circuit 
court) 
Adult Client Services Section (ACSS) for violating the 
terms and conditions of Hawaii’s Opportunity Probation with 
Enforcement (HOPE probation). Incident to Melendez being taken 
into custody, a Department of Public Safety deputy sheriff                       ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
  
  
  
  
  
   
 
 
   
 
   
    
   
 
   
    
 
   
 
 
   
 (continued. . .)searched him and uncovered a plastic “baggie” containing a white 
powdery substance from Melendez’s right-side pocket. No other 
items typically associated with drug use, such as a lighter or a 
pipe, were found in the search. Melendez was not observed or known to be under the influence of any substance at the time of 
his detention at ACSS. The powdery substance in the plastic bag 
was determined to be approximately .005 grams of a substance containing cocaine. There was no analysis as to the quantity of cocaine contained within the .005 grams. Melendez was 
subsequently charged with promoting a dangerous drug in the 
third degree in violation of 
Hawaiʻi  Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§ 712-1243.1 
B. Motion to Dismiss as De Minimis 
Melendez filed a motion to dismiss the charge on the 
basis that possession of .005 grams of cocaine constituted a de 
minimis violation and the charge should be dismissed pursuant to 
HRS § 702 -
236.2 The State did not file a written opposition, but 
1 HRS § 712- 1243 (2014) provides as follows: “(1) A person commits 
the offense of promoting a dangerous drug in the third degree if the personknowingly possesses any dangerous drug in any amount. (2) Promoting adangerous drug in the third degree is a class C felony.” 
2 HRS § 702- 236 (2014) provides as follows: 
(1) The court may dismiss a prosecution if, having regardto the nature of the conduct alleged and the nature of theattendant circumstances, it finds that the defendant’sconduct:

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
it orally opposed Melendez’s motion at the hearing on the 
motion.3 
Both parties stipulated into evidence previous expert 
testimony by Dr. George Read.  The testimony had been given at a 
hearing on a motion to dismiss a possessory drug violation as de 
minimis held approximately 17 years earlier.4 The parties also 
stipulated to facts detailed in defense counsel’s declaration 
submitted with Melendez’s motion to dismiss; no other evidence was submitted in relation to Melendez’s motion. In the 
(. . .continued) 
(a) Was within a customary license or tolerance,
which was not expressly refused by the person whose interest was infringed and which is not inconsistentwith the purpose of the law defining the offense; 
(b) Did not actually cause or threaten the harm or
evil sought to be prevented by the law defining theoffense or did so only to an extent too trivial to warrant the condemnation of conviction; or 
(c) Presents such other extenuations that it cannot 
reasonably be regarded as envisaged by the
legislature in forbidding the offense. 
(2) The court shall not dismiss a prosecution under subsection (1)(c) of this section without filing a writtenstatement of its reasons. 
3 The Honorable Judge Todd W. Eddins presided over the proceedings
in this case. 
4 Dr. Read, an expert in pharmacology, testified in relevant part 
that doses of methamphetamine as low as .005 grams had been used to treat
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Additionally, Dr. Read had
testified in State v. Viernes that .001 grams of methamphetamine was incapable of producing any pharmacological or physiological effect.  92 
Hawai‘ i 130, 131– 32, 988 P.2d 195, 196 –97 (1999).  Melendez cited the 
testimony given in Viernes in his motion to dismiss, and the State discussed 
that testimony at the hearing as if it were part of the stipulation, although it was not.

declaration, defense counsel averred in relevant part that (1) 
Melendez was taken into custody at ACSS and subjected to a 
custodial search; (2) that a baggie containing a small amount of 
white powdery substance was discovered in Melendez’s right pocket; (3) that no paraphernalia was located during the search; 
(4) the bag was later analyzed as containing a substance 
weighing .005 grams and containing cocaine; and (5) .005 grams of a substance containing cocaine is neither usable nor saleable
. Melendez also maintained that there was no evidence 
indicating he was under the influence of any drugs at the time of the custodial search. The State opposed the motion, arguing that Melendez’s violation was not de minimis because the amount of drugs Melendez possessed was five times greater than .001 
grams, which the expert testimony indicated was an amount that 
could not have any pharmacological effect. 
After hearing argument from counsel, the court orally 
granted Melendez’s motion with prejudice. The court issued an Order Granting Motion to Dismiss for De Minimis Violation (De Minimis Order ) 
on May 29, 2018.  In the De Minimis Order, the 
court made several findings of fact and conclusions of law 
related to its granting of Melendez’s motion.  The court

  . . . . ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
discussed the statutory scheme of HRS §§ 712-1241,5 712-1242,6 
and 712-1243, noting that the Hawaiʻi  Penal Code quantifies 
illegal possession by measurement in ounces or grams, not in 
5 HRS § 712- 1241(1)(a) and (2) (2014 & Supp. 2016) provides as 
follows: 
(1) A person commits the offense of promoting a dangerous
drug in the first degree if the person knowingly: 
(a) Possesses one or more preparations, compounds,mixtures, or substances of an aggregate weight of: 
(i) One ounce or more, containing methamphetamine,heroin, morphine, or cocaine or any of theirrespective salts, isomers, and salts of isomers; or 
(ii) One and one -half ounce or more, containing one 
or more of any of the other dangerous drugs; 
(2)
 Promoting a dangerous drug in the first degree is a
class A felony . 
6 HRS § 712- 1242 (2014 & Supp. 2016) provides as follows : 
(1) A person commits the offense of promoting a dangerous
drug in the second degree if the person knowingly: 
(a) Possesses twenty -five or more capsules, tablets, 
ampules, dosage units, or syrettes, containing one ormore dangerous drugs; 
(b) Possesses one or more preparations, compounds,
mixtures, or substances of an aggregate we ight of: 
(i)
 One -eighth ounce or more, containing 
methamphetamine, heroin, morphine, or cocaine or anyof their respective salts, isomers, and salts ofisomers; or 
(ii)  One
-fourth ounce or more, containing any 
dangerous drug; or 
(c) Distributes any dangerous drug in any amount. 
(2) Promoting a dangerous drug in the second degree is a
class B felony.  
 
   7 
   
  
 
 
   
  
 
 
  
   
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
tenths, hundredths, or thousandths of grams. Considering the 
scheme as a whole, the court stated, “it is clear that under the 
circumstances . . . Melendez’s possession of .005 grams of a 
substance containing cocaine eclipses the ‘any amount’ element of HRS § 712-1243,” and his possession did not actually cause or 
threaten the harm sought to be prevented by the law. 
The court further stated that it considered the 
stipulated testimony of Dr. Read, but discounted it because the 
court was uncertain about its continued reliability 
in light of 
its age. The court concluded that the relevant attendant 
circumstances were more persuasive and indicated that the cocaine Melendez possessed could not have had a pharmacological or physiological effect. Particularly, the court found it 
reasonable to infer that Melendez, as an individual under HOPE 
probation supervision, was “keenly aware of the ‘useability’ or ‘saleability’ of .005 grams of a substance containing an 
unspecified amount of cocaine.” Since Melendez had not ingested 
the cocaine in his possession it was reasonable to conclude that the cocaine would not have had a pharmacological or physiological effect. Furthermore, the court found that .005 
grams of cocaine is not capable of sale as a narcotic. Finally, 
the court concluded that the fact that Melendez was not in possession of any items associated with drug use and was not

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
under the influence of any drugs weighed strongly in favor of 
the violation being de minimis. 
II. ICA PROCEEDINGS 
The State appealed to the ICA from the De Minimis 
Order. The State argued, inter alia, that the circuit court 
abused its discretion in concluding that the critical inquiry 
was whether the amount of cocaine recovered from Melendez was useable or sal
eable and in concluding that .005 grams of cocaine 
was an amount that could not produce a pharmacological or 
physiological effect.  
In a Memorandum Opinion filed on June 14, 2019, the 
ICA vacated the De Minimis Order and remanded the case to the 
circuit court, concluding that the court erred in finding the 
cocaine Melendez possessed could not have a pharmacological 
effect, and that the erroneous finding was not “harmless error.”7 
Specifically, the ICA concluded that the circuit court erred by 
discounting the testimony of Dr. Read and relying instead “upon 
‘Melendez’s collection of experiences, beliefs, and knowledge as a cocaine consumer’” to conclude that Melendez would have consumed the substance in his possession if it were capable of 
producing an effect.  “As the movant in de minimis cases,” the

No. CAAP- 18-0000522, 2019 WL 2482183 (App. June 14, 2019) (mem.).

    ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
ICA stated, “the defendant . . . must present evidence that the 
amount possessed was incapable of producing a pharmacological or 
physiological effect.” (Emphasis added.) Since the record 
lacked evidence supporting the circuit court’s finding as to the effect of the drugs Melendez possessed, the ICA vacated the De 
Minimis Order. 
III. STANDARD OF REVIEW 
A. De Minimis Rulings 
A circuit court’s ruling with regard to whether a 
defendant’s criminal conduct constitutes a de minimis infraction 
pursuant to HRS § 702-236 is reviewed on appeal for abuse of 
discretion. State v. Oughterson, 99 
Hawaiʻi  244, 253, 54 P.3d 
415, 424 (2002).  “A court abuses its discretion if it clearly 
exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles 
of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant.” 
Id. 
(brackets omitted).  
IV. DISCUSSION 
A. Motion to Dismiss Possessory Drug Violation as De Minimis 
HRS § 702-236(1)(b) allows the circuit court to 
dismiss a prosecution if, upon consideration of the nature of the alleged conduct and attendant circumstances, the court finds that the violation “[d]id not actually cause or threaten the 
harm or evil sought to be prevented by the law defining the 
offense or did so only to an extent too trivial to warrant the 
 
   10 
  
  
   
 
  
 
   
  
  
 
  
 
 
    ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
condemnation of conviction.” In order for dismissal to be 
granted on de minimis grounds, the defendant must place “the 
relevant attendant circumstances before the trial court . . . to 
establish why dismissal is warranted in light of those 
circumstances.”  State v. Rapozo, 123 Hawaiʻi  329, 331, 235 P.3d 
325, 327 (2010) (citing State v. Park
, 55 Haw. 610, 616, 525 
P.2d 586, 591 (1974)); see also State v. Fukagawa, 100 Hawaiʻi  
498, 507, 60 P.3d 899, 908 (2002) (“[D]ismissal of a prosecution 
without any indicators from the surrounding circumstances that demonstrate a de minimis infraction would constitute an abuse of 
discretion.”). With respect to HRS § 712-1243, this court has 
stated that the harm sought to be prevented by the statute is 
“the use of the [proscribed drug] or its ‘sale or transfer for 
ultimate use.’” 
State v. Hironaka, 99 Hawai‘i  198, 209, 53 P.3d 
806, 817 (2002) (quoting State v. Vance , 61 Haw. 291, 307, 602 
P.2d 933, 944 (1979)). 
1. The Defendant Does Not Need 
To Prove that the Possessed Drugs 
Are Incapable of Producing Any Pharmacological or
Physiological Effect. 
In this case, the circuit court found that the .005 
grams of cocaine that Melendez possessed could not have any 
pharmacological or physiological effect based on the circumstances attendant to Melendez’s violation. The ICA 
concluded this finding was clearly erroneous because it was  
 
   11 
   
   
  
 
      
  
   
   
 
 
    
 
 
 
   
    
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
unsupported by the evidence in the record and vacated the De 
Minimis Order, stating that “the defendant . . . must present 
evidence that the amount possessed was incapable of producing a 
pharmacological or physiological effect.” (Emphasis added.) 
Evaluating the relevance of the possessed drug’s pharmacological 
effect requires a review of our pertinent precedent. 
In 
State v. Vance, this court first discussed the de 
minimis principle set forth in HRS § 702 -
236(1)(b) in the 
context of an HRS § 712-1243 violation.  61 Haw. at 307, 602 P.2d at 944. We observed that when the literal application of a 
possessory drug offense, such as HRS § 712-1243, would result in 
an “unduly harsh conviction for possession of a microscopic trace of a dangerous drug,” HRS § 702-236 might be applied to 
avoid an unjust result. Id. We explained that when 
the amount [of the drug] is microscopic or is infinitesimal
and in fact unusable as a narcotic, the possibility of unlawful sale or use does not exist, and proscription of 
possession under these circumstances may be inconsistent
with the rationale of the statutory scheme of narcoticscontrol. 
Id. (emphasis added). That is, when the amount of the drug is 
microscopic and “in fact unusable as a narcotic,
” then 
proscription of possession may be contrary to the statutory 
scheme. Id. Further, inability to use or sell a minute amount 
of a narcotic may be shown by other relevant factors, warranting 
dismissal of the charge.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
    
  
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
  
  
 
  12 Thus, the possession of a micros
copic amount in combination 
with other factors indicating an inability to use or sell
the narcotic, may constitute a de minimis infraction within
the meaning of HRS § 702 –236 and
, therefore, warrant 
dismissal of the charge otherwise sustainable under HRS§ 712– 1243. 
Id. 
This court again considered the application of the de 
minimis statute to a possessory drug offense in State v. 
Viernes, 92 Hawaiʻi  130, 988 P.2d 195 (1999).  In Viernes
, the 
defendant was found to be in possession of .001 grams of a 
substance containing methamphetamine. Id. at 131, 988 P.2d at 
196. The trial court found, based on the expert testimony of 
Dr. Read, that .001 grams of methamphetamine has no 
pharmacological effect, and therefore that amount was “unusable 
for use or sale.” Id. at 132, 988 P.2d at 197.  Citing Vance, 
the trial court concluded that convicting the defendant for the 
violation would be unduly harsh and dismissed the charge as a de 
minimis violation
.  Id. at 132-33, 988 P.2d at 197-98.  On 
appeal, the State argued it was erroneous for the trial court to conclude that the violation was de minimis solely because the 
amount of methamphetamine the defendant possessed was unusable.  
Id. 
at 133, 988 P.2d at 198. The Viernes court rejected this 
contention and held that “[i]nasmuch as the quantity of 
methamphetamine possessed by Viernes was infinitesimal and 
unusable as a narcotic, and was thereby incapable of causing or 
threatening the harms sought to be prevented by HRS § 712–1243,”  
 
   13 
  
 
  
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
     
     
     
  
   
  
   
 
 
  
  
     ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the trial court did not err in dismissing the charge. Id. at 
133, 988 P.2d at 198.  The court, extensively quoting from 
Vance, held that 
the .001 grams of methamphetamine was infinitesimal and was
neither useable nor saleable, it could not engender any abuse or social harm. As such, Viernes ’s possession of the 
.001 grams of methamphetamine did not threaten the harmsought to be prevented by HRS § 712– 1243. 
Id. at 134-35, 988 P.2d at 199-200 (footnote omitted).  
Accordingly, the Viernes court concluded that the trial court 
did not abuse its discretion in determining that the possession of .001 grams of methamphetamine was de minimis pursuant to HRS § 702–
236. Id. at 135, 988 P.2d at 200. 
The issue of de minimis dismissal for an HRS § 712-
1243 violation was again addressed in State v. Balanza, 
93 Hawaiʻi  279, 285, 1 P.3d 281, 287 (2000).  In Balanza, we held 
that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a 
de minimis motion because the prosecution adduced uncontroverted 
evidence that the cocaine residue in a pipe the defendant 
possessed “could be scraped out and smoked again.” 
93 Hawaiʻi at 
285, 1 P.3d at 287.  Based on the evidence in the record, we 
concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in 
denying the motion to dismiss. Id. 
In 
State v. Hironaka, we again affirmed a trial 
court’s denial of a defendant’s de minimis motion.  99 Hawaiʻi  
198, 200, 53 P.3d 806, 808 (2002).  The defendant was charged  
 
   
 14  
  
  
 
 
 
 
   
 
    
  
 
  
 
 
 
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
under HRS § 712-1243 for his possession of .044 grams of residue 
containing methamphetamine. Id. He adduced no evidence that 
the amount of methamphetamine he possessed was “incapable of producing a pharmacological or physiological effect or was not saleable.”  Id. at 209, 53 P.3d at 817. Thus, “there was no 
evidence introduced from which the circuit court could have concluded that [the defendant’s] conduct did not ‘cause or 
threaten the harm or evil sought to be prevented by the law,’ i.e.
, the use of the methamphetamine or its ‘sale or transfer 
for ultimate use.’” Id. (quoting Vance, 61 Haw. at 307, 602 
P.2d at 944).  As such, we held that the court did not err in denying the defendant’s motion to dismiss on the grounds that his violation was de minimis.  
Id. 
The relevance of a possessed drug’s “pharmacological 
effect” was clarified in State v. Fukagawa , 100 Hawaiʻi  498, 60 
P.3d 899 (2002). A majority of this court rejected a contention 
by the dissent that the significant inquiry in de minimis drug 
cases is whether the amount of drugs possessed could have an 
“illicit” or “narcotic” effect. Fuka
gawa , 100 Hawaiʻi  at 506, 60 
P.3d at 907.  Instead, the court stated that in considering the 
effect of the amount of drugs possessed, “the proper inquiry in 
de minimis cases is whether the amount possessed could produce a pharmacological or physiological effect.”  
Id. This court  
 
   15 
   
   
    
   
 
   
   
     
    
     
  
   
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
observed that the amount of substance containing methamphetamine 
in the defendant’s possession weighed .018 grams, and Dr. Read 
had testified that doses of methamphetamine as low as .005 grams 
were used to treat ADHD. Id. Additionally, we concluded that 
the trial court’s determination 
that the substance recovered was 
usable was supported by testimony that it may have constituted an amount sufficient to be “used” by someone. Id. Thus, we 
held that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to dismiss. Id. at 507, 60 P.3d at 908. 
This court has thus consistently held over the past 
forty years that when the amount of drugs possessed is unusable, the violation of HRS § 712-1243 does not “cause or threaten the harm or evil sought to be prevented by the law defining the 
offense,” 
and a de minimis dismissal would be warranted in such 
circumstances. HRS § 702-236; see Vance, 61 Haw. at 307, 602 
P.2d at 944; Viernes, 92 Hawaiʻi  at 134, 988 P.2d at 199; cf. 
Balanza, 93 Hawaiʻi  at 285, 1 P.3d at 287; Hironaka, 99 Hawaiʻi  
at 209, 53 P.3d at 817; Fuk
agawa , 100 Hawaiʻi  at 506, 60 P.3d at 
907. Although we have declined to read a usable quantity 
standard into HRS § 712 -1243, it is clear that if the amount 
possessed is “so minuscule that it cannot be . . . 
used in such 
a way as to have any discernible effect on the human body, it 
follows that the drug cannot lead to abuse, social harm, or  
 
   16 
   
   
     
  
   
 
  
 
 
   
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
property and violent crimes,” i.e., the harm sought to be 
prevented by HRS § 712-1243.  Viernes, 92 Hawaiʻi  at 134, 988 
P.2d at 199. Under such circumstances, dismissal under HRS 
§ 702-236 is warranted.  See id. 
Hence, contrary to the conclusion of the ICA, a 
defendant’s burden on a de minimis motion for an HRS § 712-
1243 
violation is not to specifically prove that the drugs possessed 
could not have a pharmacological or physiological effect, but to 
“place 
‘all’ of the relevant attendant circumstances before the 
trial court . . . to establish why dismissal is warranted in 
light of those circumstances.”  Rapozo, 123 Hawaiʻi  at 331, 235 
P.3d at 327.  When the defendant proves the amount of drugs 
possessed is incapable of producing a pharmacological effect, it 
is clear the amount is not usable or saleable.  Viernes, 92 
Hawai‘i  at 134-35, 988 P.2d at 199-200.  In such cases, in the 
absence of other circumstances indicating the violation actually 
threatened the harm sought to be prevented by HRS § 712-1243, de 
minimis dismissal will be warranted.  Id. But proving that the 
possessed drugs could not have a pharmacological effect is not a 
condition precedent for de minimis dismissal of a possessory drug violation. Our decisions firmly establish that if the 
amount of drugs possessed is not usable or saleable, the violation does not engender the harms sought to be prevented by

HRS § 712-1243 absent demonstrable evidence to the contrary. 
Id. at 134, 988 P.2d at 199; Balanza, 93 Hawaiʻi  at 285, 1 P.3d 
at 287; Hironaka, 99 Hawaiʻi  at 209, 53 P.3d at 817; Fuk
agawa , 
100 Hawaiʻi  at 506, 60 P.3d at 907. In sum, if the possessed 
drugs are neither usable nor saleable, and the attendant 
circumstances do not otherwise demonstrate the defendant’s 
violation caused the harm HRS § 712-1243 seeks to prevent, de 
minimis dismissal is warranted. 
2. The Circuit Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in 
Dismissing the Charge as De Minimis. 
The parties in this case stipulated that “0.005 grams 
of a substance containing cocaine is neither usable nor saleable.” Even assuming that the amount of cocaine Melendez possessed was theoretically capable of producing a 
pharmacological or physiological effect, it was well within the 
court’s discretion to dismiss the charge against Melendez as de 
minimis because, per the parties’ stipulation, the cocaine Melendez po
ssessed was not a usable or saleable amount.  Since 
it was neither usable nor saleable, Melendez’s possession of the cocaine did not “cause or threaten the harm or evil sought to be prevented” by HRS § 712-1243 and violated the statute “only to an extent too trivial to warrant the condemnation of 
conviction.”  HRS § 702-236(1)(b); see Viernes, 92 
Hawai‘i  at 
133, 988 P.2d at 198 (“Inasmuch as the quantity of

methamphetamine possessed by Viernes was infinitesimal and 
unusable as a narcotic, [it] was thereby incapable of causing or 
threatening the harms sought to be prevented by HRS § 712-
1243[.]”). 
Additionally, even if it was erroneous for the circuit 
court, based on the evidentiary record, to conclude that 
Melendez had proved that the .005 grams of cocaine that he possessed was incapable of producing a pharmacological or physiological effect, “it is well-
settled that ‘[a]n appellate 
court may affirm a judgment of the lower court on any ground in 
the record that supports affirmance.’” Fukagawa, 100 Hawaiʻi  at 
506-07, 60 P.3d at 907-08 (alteration in original) (quoting 
State v. Dow, 96 Hawaiʻi  320, 326, 30 P.3d 926, 932 (2001)). 
Thus, the ICA should have considered other grounds in the record 
supporting affirmance of the De Minimis Order, particularly the stipulated fact that the cocaine Melendez possessed was unusable 
and unsaleable. 
See State v. Woodhall, 129 Hawaiʻi  397, 405, 301 
P.3d 607, 615 (2013) (noting that stipulations as to facts are 
conclusive and binding). Under our precedents, this stipulation 
warrants dismissal of the charge as de minimis unless the other attendant circumstances demonstrate that the violation did in 
fact cause or threaten the harm sought to be prevented by HRS 
§ 712-1243.

Balanza, 93 Hawaiʻi  at 285, 1 P.3d at 287; Hironaka, 99 Hawaiʻi 
at 209, 53 P.3d at 817. 
Further, none of the attendant circumstances in this 
case refute the conclusion that Melendez’s possession of an 
unusable and unsaleable amount of cocaine did not threaten or cause the harm sought to be prevented by HRS § 712-1243.  We 
note that the circuit court found that Melendez was not in 
possession of any items typically associated with drug use at the time of his violation and was not under the influence of any 
drugs.  There is also no indication Melendez was engaged in any 
other criminal conduct. These circumstances additionally do not militate against a finding that the violation was de minimis.  
Fukagawa, 100 
Hawai‘i  at 507, 60 P.3d at 908.  Thus, inasmuch as 
the record supports the circuit court’s determination that 
Melendez’s violation was de minimis as the possessed drug was neither usable nor saleable, the court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the charge.
8 Id. at 506-07, 60 P.3d at 
907-08. 
8 Given our disposition in this case, it is unnecessary to review 
the ICA’s determination that the circuit court erred in finding that the
amount of cocaine Melendez possessed could not have had a pharmacological or
physiological effect.
