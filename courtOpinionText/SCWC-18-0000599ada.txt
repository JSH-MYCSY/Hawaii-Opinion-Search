OPINION OF THE COURT BY WILSON, J.  
 
I.  INTRODUCTION  
This case arises from Petitioner/ Defendant -Appellant 
Susan E. Shaw’s (“Shaw”) five-year prison sentence and 
conviction for Computer Fraud in the Third Degree  (“Comput er 
Fraud 3”)  and Fraudulent Use of a Credit Card  (“Credit Card Electronically Filed

2 Fraud”).  Shaw appealed her Judgment of Conviction and Sentence 
to the Intermediate Court of Appeals (“ ICA”).  The ICA vacated 
the Circuit Court of the First Circuit ’s1 (“circuit court ”) 
Judgment of Conviction and Sentence and remanded the case to the 
circuit court for further proceedings.  
  Shaw raises four primary points of error and alleges 
that the ICA erred :  (1) when it held that the State of Hawaiʻi 
(the “State”)  need not allege that Shaw acted pursuant to a 
scheme or course of conduct for Computer Fraud 3  in the 
indictment ; (2) when it held that the circuit court (a) did not 
err in instructing the jury on the definition of “inference” and 
(b) did not err in instructing the jury on the elements of 
Computer Fraud 3; (3) when it held that the circuit court did 
not err in denying her Motion to Dismiss with Prejudice; and 
(4) when it failed to address the issues related to (a)  the 
sufficiency of evidenc e, (b) the admission of unsworn hearsay 
evidence, and (c)  the numerous prejudicial evidentiary errors.   
  We hold that the ICA did not err  when it held that  
aggregation of multiple transactions under Computer Fraud 3  is 
permissible .  We further hold that the indictment was defective 
with respect to Count I, Computer Fraud 3,  and that  the denial 
of Shaw’s Motion to Dismiss the Indictment was error.

(continued . . .)  Accordingly , we vacate the circuit court’s order denying Shaw’s 
Motion to Dismiss the Indictment for Count I, and remand with 
instructions to  dismiss Count I without prejudice .  Because the 
indictment for Count I, Computer Fraud 3 is dismissed  without 
prejudice , we do not address Shaw’s other points of error.  
II.  BACKGROUND  
  The charges against Shaw arise from allegations that 
between January 16, 2017, through and including May 18, 2017, 
Shaw falsely inflated customer tips for 105 customers, totaling 
$717.35, at the restaurant where she worked as a server.   Shaw 
was charged  with one count of Computer Fraud 3, in violation of 
Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes ( “HRS”) § 708-891.6 (2014), and one 
count of Credit Card Fraud, in violation of HRS § 708 -8100(1)(c) 
(2014).2  After a jury trial, Shaw was convicted o n both counts.  
                     
2  The August 15, 2017 indictment states:  
 
 The Grand Jury charges:  
 COUNT I:  On or about January 16, 2017, through  and 
including May 18, 2017, in the City and County of Honolulu, 
State of Hawaii, Susan E. Shaw, did knowingly access a 
computer, computer system, or computer network with the 
intent to commit the offense of theft in the third degree, 
thereby committing th e offense of Computer Fraud in the 
Third Degree in violation of Section 708 -891.6 of the 
Hawaii Revised Statutes.  
 A person commits the offense of theft in the third 
degree if she intentionally obtains and exerts control over 
property of another, the value  of which exceeds Two Hundred 
and Fifty Dollars ($250.00), with intent to deprive the 
other of property valued in excess of Two Hundred and Fifty 
Dollars ($250.00).  Sections 708 -832(a)(a) and 708 -830(1) 
of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.  (HPD Report Number 
17189819 -002).  Count I related to the access and use of a 
computer, to with a “point of sale computer terminal”, with *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
4 Prior to the jury trial , Shaw filed a Motion to 
Dismiss with Prejudice  on the basis that the State failed to 
adduce sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for 
either of the two counts at the grand jury proceedings because 
the State excluded  elements of the offense.  Additionally, Shaw 
contended that Computer Fraud 3  could only be prosecuted based 
on a single victim of theft, and Credit Card Fraud could only be 
prosecuted based on the use of a single credit card or credit 
card number and a single credit card victim.   Shaw argued that 
if HRS § 708 -801(6) allows aggrega tion of theft amounts from a 
single victim or multiple victims, the State failed to adduce 
evidence that Shaw acted pursuant to a single scheme or course 
of conduct required for aggregation.   The circuit court denied 
                     
(continued . . .) 
 
intent commit [ sic] theft of money valued in excess of 
$250.00, and the defendant did, in fact, so obtain money 
valued in excess of $250. 00. 
 COUNT II:  On or about January 16, 2017, through and 
including May 18, 2017, in the City and County of Honolulu, 
State of Hawaii, Susan E. Shaw, with intent to defraud the 
issuer, or another person or organization providing money, 
services, or anythin g of value, or any other person, did 
use credit card numbers without the consent of the 
cardholders for the purpose of obtaining money or anything 
else of value, and the value of all money and other things 
of value so obtained exceeded Three Hundred Dollar s 
($300.00) in any six -month period, thereby committing the 
offense of Fraudulent Use of Credit Card, in violation of 
Sections 708 -8100(1)(c) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.  
(HPD Report no 17 -189819-003).  Count II related to the use 
of credit card number s, without the cardholders’ consent, 
for the purpose of obtaining money valued in excess of 
$300.00 during the time period specific herein, a period of 
less than six months, and the defendant di, in fact, so 
obtain money valued in excess of $300.00  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
5 Shaw’s motion , finding that “overwhelmi ng evidence ” supported 
the indictment .  
On July 30, 2018, Shaw appealed to the ICA .  Relevant 
to this appeal, Shaw argued that the indictment was fatally 
defective for failing to allege that Shaw acted pursuant to a 
scheme or continuing course of conduct3 and that the circuit 
court erred in denying Shaw’s Motion to Dismiss with Prejudice  
because the State failed to adduce sufficient evidence to 
establish probable cause that Shaw used a computer to steal more 
than $250 .00 from a single victim.   See HRS § 708 -891.6 (“A 
person commits the offense of computer fraud in the third degree 
if the person knowingly accesses a computer, computer system, or 
computer network with the intent to commit the offense of theft 
in the third or fourth degree. ”); HRS § 708-832(1)(a) (2016) (“A 
person commits the offense of theft in the third degree if the 
person commits theft . . . [o]f property or services the value 
of which exceeds $250[ .]”). 
                     
3  The indictment in Count I read as follows:  
COUNT I:  On or about January 16, 2017, through and 
including May 18, 2017, in the City and County of Honolulu, 
State of Hawaii, Susan E. Shaw, did knowingly access a 
computer, computer system, or computer network wit h the 
intent to commit the offense of theft in the third degree, 
thereby committing the offense of Computer Fraud in the 
Third Degree in violation of Section 708 -891.6 of the 
Hawaii Revised Statutes.  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
6   The ICA vacated the circuit court’s Judgment of 
Conviction and Sentence , vacated Shaw’ s conviction for Credit 
Card Fraud under Count II,  and remanded the case for a new trial 
on Count I , Computer Fraud 3 .  The ICA concluded  that the 
indictment for Count I was legally sufficient , and that Shaw 
failed to show , under Motta/Wells,4 Count I could not be 
construed to charge Computer Fraud 3 .  The ICA also concluded 
that Shaw failed to show that  she suffered prejudice from the 
State’s failure to allege a scheme or course of conduct in Count 
I.  Additionally, the ICA held that the State was not barr ed 
from aggregating multiple alleged instances of theft in charging 
Shaw with Computer Fraud 3:  
In Count I, Shaw was charged with Computer Fraud 3, which 
requires an allegation that the charged individual 
“knowingly accesse[d] a computer, computer system, or 
computer network with the intent to commit the offense of 
theft in the third or fourth degree .”  HRS § 708 -891.6 
(emphasis added).  Thus, because Computer Fraud 3 is 
predicated on theft in the third or fourth degree, it 
follows that Computer Fraud 3 may  also be charged as a 
continuing course of conduct.  
 
The ICA further held that the indictment as a whole charged Shaw 
with Computer Fraud 3 under a continuing course of conduct 
theory because both counts referred to the same four -month time 
period when the  alleged crimes occurred.  
                     
4  An appellate court will “not reverse a conviction ba sed upon a 
defective indictment unless the defendant can show prejudice or that the 
indictment cannot within reason be construed to charge a crime.”  State v. 
Motta, 66 Haw. 89, 91, 657 P.2d 1019, 1020 (1 983).   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
7 For the Credit Card Fraud charge , the ICA held that 
the circuit court erred when it failed to dismiss Count II for 
lack of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause because 
the plain language of HRS § 708 -8100(2) did not all ow the 
offense of Credit Card Fraud to be prosecuted as a class C 
felony based on an aggregation of the values of multiple 
transactions involving more than one credit card or credit card 
number.  In light of this holding, the ICA held that the circuit 
court erred when it failed to dismiss Count II.5  For Count I,  
Computer Fraud 3,  the ICA held that Shaw’s challenge for lack of 
probable cause was rendered moot when she was subsequently 
convicted at trial, and held that there were no “unusual 
circumstances ” in this case  to warrant a review of probable 
cause.  But, the ICA  held that Shaw’s conviction  for Computer 
Fraud 3 must be vacated and remanded for a new trial because the 
instruction regarding Computer Fraud 3 did not submit to the 
jury the factual questio n of whether Shaw engaged in one scheme 
or course of conduct . 
  Shaw argues before  this court that  the ICA erred when 
it held that the State need not allege scheme in the indictment  
                     
5  The ICA’s dismissal of Count II, Credit C ard Fraud, was not 
appealed to this court and will not be addressed in this opinion’s 
discussion . *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

to Dismiss  with Prejudice .   
III.  STANDARDS OF REVIEW  
A. Statutory Interpretation  
The interpretation of a statute is a question of law 
reviewable de novo.  State v. Arceo , 84 Hawai‘i 1, 10, 928 P.2d 
843, 852 (1996).  We follow several established rules of 
statutory co nstruction:  
First, our foremost obligation is to ascertain and give effect to 
the intention of the legislature, which is obtained primarily 
from the language contained in the statute[s] themselves.  
Second, [l]aws in pari materia, or upon the same subject matter, 
shall be construed with reference to each other.  What is clear 
in one statute may be called in aid to explain what is doubtful 
in another.  And, third, [t]he legislature is presumed not to 
intend an absurd result, and legislation will be construed  to 
avoid, if possible, inconsistency, contradiction[,] and 
illogicality.  
 
Id. at 19, 928 P.2d at 861 (alterations in original) (citations 
and quotations omitted).  
B. Motion to Dismiss Indictment  
We review de novo a circuit court ’s order denying a  
motion to d ismiss an indictment based on sufficiency of the  
evidence to support the indictment.  State v. Taylor , 126 Hawaiʻi 
205, 215, 269 P.3d 740, 750 (2011).  
In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to establish 
probable cause before the grand jury, every legitimate 
inference that may be drawn from the evidence must be drawn 
in favor of the indictment and neither the t rial court nor 
the appellate court on review may substitute its judgment 
as to the weight of the evidence for that of the Grand 
Jury.  The evidence to support an indictment need not be 
sufficient to support a conviction.  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
9 Id. (quoting State v. Ganal , 81 Hawaiʻi 358, 367, 917 P.2d 370,  
379 (1996)).   
IV.  DISCUSSION  
 
A. The ICA did not err when it held that multiple transactions 
can be aggregat ed pursuant to HRS § 708 -801(6) for Computer 
Fraud 3.  
Shaw contends  that aggregation of multiple 
transactions pursuant to HRS § 708-801(6) is impermissible for 
proving Computer Fraud 3.  The ICA was correct in its 
determination  that aggregation of multiple transactions pursuant 
to HRS § 708-801(6) is permissible for Computer Fraud 3 .  
However, we respectfully disagree with th e ICA’s reasoning.  
The ICA concluded that  the theft statute support s 
aggregation of multiple transactions for Computer Fraud 3.  It 
is true that t his court  has previously  held that theft may be 
charged under a continuing course of conduct theory : 
The lang uage of the theft statute indicates that 
theft may be charged on a continuing conduct theory.   The 
theft statute provides that a person commits theft if the 
person “obtains, or exerts control over, the property of 
another by deception with intent to depriv e the other of 
the property.”   HRS § 708 -830(2) (2014).  Similarly, a 
person commits theft in the second degree “if the person 
commits theft .  . . [o]f property or services the value of 
which exceeds $300.”   HRS § 708 -831(1)(b).  
 
Here, the Legislature ’s decision to define theft as 
obtaining or exerting control over “property or services,”  
see HRS §§ 708 -830.5(1)(a),  708-831(1)(b),  708-832(1)(a),  
708-833(1), and not “a piece of property or a service,” 
indicates that the Legislature did not necessarily intend  
that theft be charged individually.  Furthermore,  HRS 
§ 708-801(6) provides that “[a]mounts involved in thefts 
committed pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct, 
whether the property taken be of one person or several 
persons, may be aggregated in dete rmining the class or 
grade of  the offense.”   This indicates that the Legislature *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
10 explicitly considered that theft could be charged on a 
continuing course of conduct theory.  
 
State v.  Yokota, 143 Hawai‘i 200, 205-06, 426 P.3d  424, 429-30 
(2018).   
However, that Computer Fraud 3 is “predicated” on 
theft in the third or fourth degree does not answer the question 
of whether Computer Fraud 3 can be charged as a continuing 
course of conduct.  This is because Computer Fraud requires a 
specific intent  to commit theft in the third or fourth degree.  
The continuing offense doctrine asks “whether the individual 
acts are prohibited, or the course of action which they 
constitute. ”  Blockburger v. United States , 284 U.S. 299, 302 
(1932) (emphasis added) .  The continuous o ffense doctrine 
therefore turns on whether the legislature envisioned that the 
conduct of the offense could constitute a continuous course of 
action.  Yokota, 143 Hawaiʻi at 205, 426 P.3d at 429 (“[T]he test 
to determine whether a crime may be charged on a continuous 
conduct theory is whether the language, structure, and purpose 
of the statute reveals a legislative intent to criminalize 
continuing conduct.”  (quoting State v. Decoite , 132 Hawaiʻi 436, 
438, 323 P.3d 80, 81 (2014) )).  Whether the proscribed conduct  
“is statutorily defined as an uninterrupted and continuing 
course of conduct, or manifests a plain legislative purpose to *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
11 be treated as such, or both ” is critica l to the continuing 
offense doctrine.   Arceo, 84 Hawaiʻi at 19, 928 P.2d at 861.   
If the statute “comprehend[s] acts that essentially 
are of a transitory nature or brief duration ,” then the 
legislature likely did not contemplate the crime to be 
continuing ; but if the act proscribed by the statute “describes 
an ongoing course of conduct,” that “connotes a legislative 
design to make an aspect of [the crime] continuing[.]”  State v. 
Temple, 65 Haw. 261, 267, 650 P.2d 1358, 1362 (1982).  Here, 
Computer Fraud 3  is defined as follows:   “A person commits the 
offense of computer fraud in the third degree if the person 
knowingly accesses  a computer, computer system, or computer 
network with the intent to commit the offense of theft in the 
third or fourth degree .”  HRS § 708 -891.6 (emphasis added) .  
“‘Access’ means to gain entry to, instruct, communicate with, 
store data in, retrieve data from, or otherwise make use of any 
resources of a computer, computer system, or computer network. ”  
HRS § 708-890.  At least some o f these acts “connote[] a 
legislative design to make an aspect of [Computer Fraud 3] 
continuing[.]”  Temple, 65 Haw. at 267, 650 P.2d at 1362.  At 
the least, “communicat[ing] with,” “stor[ing] data in,” 
“mak[ing] use of a computer, computer system, or comp uter 
network” reflect acts that are not “transitory .  . . or brief,”  
id., but in stead “involve ongoing processes[.]”  Decoite, 132 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
12 Hawaiʻi at 439, 323 P.3d at 83.   Cf. State v. Martin , 62 Haw. 
364, 366, 616 P.2d 193, 19 5–96 (1980) (finding continuous theft  
on the state when defendant filed fraudulent public assistance 
forms); State v. Stenger , 122 Hawai‘i 271, 279, 226 P.3d 441, 449 
(2010) (finding continuous theft on the state when defendant 
continued to receive public assistance when no longer needed) .  
Thus, the ICA correct ly held that aggregation of multiple 
transactions is permissible for Computer Fraud 3.  
B. The ICA erred when it held that the State need not allege 
scheme in the charging document for Computer Fraud 3  under 
the Motta/Wells rule. 
The ICA incorrectly held  that under the Motta/Wells 
rule the Count I  charge for  Computer Fraud 3 was legally 
sufficient because it was not necessary to include in the 
indictment  language establishing that  Shaw acted pursuant to a 
scheme or course of conduct.  Because Count I failed to include 
the essential attendant circumstances element of scheme or 
course of conduct , it cannot be reasonably construed to charge a 
crime.  As discussed below, even if the language in th e 
indictment  tracks the statutory offense languag e, that alone 
does not render a charge legally sufficient .  When the 
indictment is read as a whole, Count I fails to charge a crime.  
Under the Motta/Wells rule, if an objection to a 
deficient indictment is raised for the first time on appeal, the 
indictme nt must be liberally construed.  Motta, 66 Haw. at 90, *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
13 657 P.2d at 1019–20; State v. Wells , 78 Hawai‘i 373, 381, 894 
P.2d 70, 78 (1995) .  An appellate court will “not reverse a 
conviction based upon a defective indictment unless the 
defendant can show prej udice or that the indictment cannot 
within reason be construed to charge a crime.”   Motta, 66 Haw. 
at 91, 657 P.2d at 1020.  If an element of an offense is missing 
or an element in the charge does not “comport with its statutory 
definition,” the charge can not be reasonably construed to charge 
a crime.  State v. Baker , 146 Hawai‘i 299, 308, 463 P.3d 956 , 965 
(2020), as corrected  (May 20, 2020)  (citing State v. Pacquing , 
139 Hawai‘i 302, 308, 389 P.3d  897, 903 (2016) ; State v. Wheeler , 
121 Hawai‘i 383, 394, 219 P.3d 1173, 1181 (2009)).  However, “ one 
‘way in which  an otherwise deficient count can be reasonably  
construed to  charge a crime is by examination of the charge as a 
whole,’” State v. Tominiko , 126 Hawai‘i 68, 76, 266 P.3d 1122, 
1130 (2011)  (quoting State v. Elliott , 77 Hawai‘i 309, 312, 884 
P.2d 372, 375 (1994)) , which allows “two counts [to] be read 
together ,” id.  This court  “employ[s] practical considerations 
and common sense ” when interpreting the indictment as a whole.   
State v. Sprattling , 99 Hawai‘i 312, 319, 55 P.3d 276, 283 
(2002).  Additionally, this court has held that, in some cases, 
when the language of the charge tracked the statutory definition  
of the offense  and all of the elements as defined in the statute *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
14 are alleged in the indictment, the indictment was not defective.  
See State v. Treat , 67 Haw. 119, 120, 680 P.2d 250, 251 (1984) .   
Here, the Motta/Wells liberal construction rule 
applies because Shaw challenged the sufficiency of the 
indictment for the first time on appeal.  Based on t he 
Motta/Wells liberal construction rule, the ICA held that the 
Computer Fraud 3  charge was legally  sufficient and held that the 
State was not required to “ expressly allege in the Indictment 
that Shaw engaged  in a scheme or course of conduct ” because the 
Computer Fraud 3 charge “tracked” the language of the statutory 
offense and the predicate theft offense , and all of the 
statutory elements were included in the  indictment.  
1. Because the indictment did not allege that Shaw 
intended to commit theft in the fourt h degree, and no 
transaction was greater than $250.00, the State was 
required to allege scheme or course of conduct  in the 
indictment.   
The State alleged only that Shaw “did knowingly access 
a computer . . . with the intent to commit the offense of theft 
in the third degree , [and] thereby committed  the offense” of 
Computer Fraud 3.  (Emphasis added.)  Because the indictment did 
not allege Shaw knowingly accessed a computer, computer system, 
or computer network with the intent to commit the offense of 
theft in the fourth degree , and since none of the individual 
transactions were greater than $250.00, the State was required 
to include in the indictment language that Shaw possessed the *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
15 intent to commit theft in the third degree through a continuing 
course of c onduct over the four -month period.  The State failed 
to do so.    
Shaw correctly contends that even under the 
Motta/Wells liberal construction rule , the indictment was 
insufficient .  The indictment  failed to charge an essential 
attendant circumstances element.  See HRS § 702 -205 (“The 
elements of an offense are such (1) conduct, (2) attendant 
circumstances, and (3) results of conduct[.]”); State v. Bovee , 
139 Hawaiʻi 530, 538, 394 P.3d 760, 768 (2017) .  In this case, 
the State aggregated  the theft amounts f rom separate victims to 
reach the $250 .00 threshold for Theft in the Third Degree  
necessary to prove Computer Fraud 3.  The State’s prosecution of 
Shaw for Computer Fraud 3 necessarily required proof of multiple 
thefts committed pursuant to a common scheme  or course of 
conduct because none of the individual thefts met the $250.00 
statutory threshold.  Charging this crime under an aggregation 
theory is predicated  on Shaw having committed the thefts 
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct.  Thus, the indict ment 
must allege that the defendant acted pursuant to a scheme or 
course of conduct when Computer Fraud 3 is charged based on an 
aggregation theory because scheme or course of conduct is a n 
attendant circumstance s element that the State must prove.  
Because the indictment did not include this element of scheme or *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
16 course of conduct, required for Computer Fraud 3  based upon an 
aggregation theory , the indictment failed to charge a crime.   
2. The fact that Count I, Computer Fraud 3, tracked the 
statutory offense language does not mean it was 
legally sufficient.  
The ICA was incorrect when it held that the charge was 
sufficient merely because the charge “tracked” the language of 
the statutory offense and the predicate theft offense , and all 
the statutory elements w ere included in the  indictment.  This 
court has stated that a charge can be insufficient even when the 
charge tracks the language of the statute if it fails to 
sufficiently describe the crime:   
In some cases, however, a charge tracking the language of 
the statute defining the offense nevertheless violates an 
accused’s due process rights . 
 
This is so because although “some statutes in our 
criminal laws so clearly and specifically define[] 
the offense that nothing more is required in [a 
charge] than the adop tion of language of the statute, 
other statutes fail to sufficiently describe the 
crime and [a charge] couched merely in the language 
of such a statute would violate due process .” 
 
State v. Nesmith , 127 Hawai‘i 48, 53, 276 P.3d 617, 622 (2012)  
(emphases ad ded) (quoting  State v. Israel , 78 Hawai‘i 66, 73, 890 
P.2d 303, 310  (1995)).  
The indictment in the instant case “ fail[s] to 
sufficiently describe the crime ” and, thus, the  charge “couched 
merely in the [statutory] language . . . violate[s] due 
process.”  See id.  As discussed above, to charge Shaw with *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
17 Computer Fraud 3 based on  an aggregation theory, the State must 
show that Shaw acted pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct.  
If one of the individual transactions met the $250 .00 statutory 
threshold, sch eme or course of conduct need not be proved, and 
indictment language that simply track s the language of the 
statute would be  sufficient.  But here, the individual 
transactions do not meet the statutory threshold, so the State 
must prove scheme or course of  conduct.  Thus, when an 
aggregation theory is used, a charge that simply tracks the 
language of the statute can violate due process even under the 
Motta/Wells liberal construction rule because scheme or course 
of conduct  is necessary to prove Computer Fra ud 3 based upon an 
aggregation theory . 
3. Count I is legally insufficient even if the indictment 
is read “as a whole.”  
Even if Count I failed to charge a crime, the ICA 
concluded  that “it is clear from reading the Indictment as  a 
whole that the State charged Shaw with Computer Fraud 3 on a  
continuing course of conduct theory .”  Relying on Tominiko6 and 
reading the two charges together, t he ICA reasoned that, Charge 
                     
6 In Tominiko , the defendant was charged with operating a vehicle 
under the influence of an intoxicant ( “OVUII”).  Tominiko , 126 Hawaiʻi at 71, 
266 P.3d at 1125.  The language charging OVUII was missing the element that 
the conduct occurred on a public roadway .  Id. at 76, 266 P.3d at 1130.  The 
supreme court read the indictment “as a whole” and held that the OVUII charge 
was not deficie nt because a separate count contained the necessary  allegation 
and both counts refer red to operating a motor vehicle on  the same day in 
Honolulu, Hawaiʻi.  Id. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
18 I was sufficient because the two charges included the same time 
period and Charge II’s plural la nguage indicated multiple 
victims and instances of theft.   
A key distinction between Tominiko  and this case is 
that, in Tominiko , the other count explicitly included the 
essential element.  Tominiko , 126 Hawai‘i at 76, 266 P.3d at 1130 
(holding that a cha rge that was missing the essential public 
road element  was not insufficient when read “as a whole” with 
another charge that did include the essential public road 
element).  Here, Charge II did not specifically allege scheme or 
course of conduct, but instea d alluded to a scheme or course of 
conduct with the use of plural language, alleging that Shaw “ did 
use credit card numbers without the consent of the cardholders  
for purpose of obtaining money,  or anything else of value, and 
the value of all money and oth er things of value so obtained 
exceeded  Three Hundred Dollars ($300.00)  . . . .”   Thus, 
Tominiko  is not analogous because in Tominiko  the other count 
explicitly included the required element , whereas, here, the 
other count implie d scheme or course of condu ct, without 
explicitly identifying  it.  
Analogizing to Tominiko , the ICA pointed to the same 
time period in both counts to support its conclusion that “both 
charges are based on the same underlying conduct.”   Once again, 
Tominiko  is not analogous.  In Tominiko, this court pointed to *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
19 the facts that both charges referred to operating a motor 
vehicle in Honolulu,  Hawaiʻi on the same day to reach its 
conclusion that “ it can be reasonably inferred that they refer 
to the same incident .”  Tominiko , 126 Hawaiʻi at 76, 266 P.3d at 
1130.  In this case, the ICA relied exclusively on the fact that 
the charges referenced the same  location, Honolulu,  Hawaiʻi, and 
the same four -month time period.  The inference that the two 
counts refer to the same incidences  cannot be “rea sonably 
inferred” as in Tominiko .  Four months is a much longer time 
period than one day , and the two charges c ould have referenced 
different activities during those four months.  In Tominiko , the 
two charges were related to the same singular incident  involving 
a “motor vehicle”  that occured on the same day, whereas, here, 
there are multiple instances  of theft , making it less apparent  
that the instances of theft by computer fraud referred to in 
Count I are the same instances referred to by Count II  for 
Credit Card Fraud .   
Notably, in Tominiko , both charges shared a common 
element:  operating a motor vehicle.7  Id. at 70, 266 P.3d at 
1124.  And the court pointed to this commonality when reading 
the indictment as a whole.  Id. at 76, 266 P.3d at 1130.  In 
                     
7 In Tominiko , the defendant was charged with OVUII  and Driving 
Without Motor Vehicle Insurance .  126 Hawaiʻi at 70, 266 P.3d at 1124. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
20 contrast, an individual can commit Computer Fraud 3 without 
using credit cards and can commit Credit Card Fraud wi thout 
using a computer.  Therefore , the ICA ’s reliance on Tominiko  is 
unfounded .  The similarities between Count I and Count II  are 
insufficient to support the argument that the two counts  refer 
to the same underlying conduct.  Therefore, the two counts 
cannot be “read as a whole ,” and the ICA erred when it concluded 
that Count I , Computer Fraud 3,  could be rea sonably construed to 
charge a crime.  
Consequently, w e conclude t hat Count I, Computer Fraud 
3 was insufficient.  See Wheeler, 121 Hawaiʻi at 394, 21 9 P.3d at 
1181 (holding charge was insufficient when it failed to allege 
all of the essential elements of the offense charged).  
V.  CONCLUSION  
  For the foregoing reasons, we hold that  when Computer 
Fraud 3 is charged under an aggregation theory and none o f the 
individual instances of theft meet the $250 .00 statutory 
threshold, the State must allege the defendant acted pursuant to 
a scheme or course of conduct  in the charging document .  
Accordingly,  we affirm in part, and vacate in part, the ICA’s 
June 19, 2020 judgment on appeal.  Because Count I, Computer 
Fraud 3, did not contain an essential attendant circumstances 
element required for  the offense charged , we vacate the circuit 
court’s order denying Shaw’s Motion to Dismiss the Indictment *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
