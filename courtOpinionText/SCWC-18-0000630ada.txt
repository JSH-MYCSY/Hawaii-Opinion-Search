OPINION OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J.   
I. Introduction 
This case arises from the Family Court of the First 
Circuit’s (“family court”) determination of child custody, child 
support, and property division in a divorce proceeding between 
DL (“Father”) and CL (“Mother”).

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
This is Father’s third appeal in this divorce proceeding.  
We decided Father’s first appeal in a published opinion, DL v. 
CL, -- P.3d ---, 2020 WL 1902319 (April 16, 2020) (“DL I”).1 
Father’s application for certiorari (“Application”) presents two 
questions: 
(1) Did the ICA gravely err in finding [Father’s] motions
untimely, and not reviewing the motions on their
merits? 
(2) Did the ICA gravely err by not reviewing the familycourt’s denial of [Father’s] motion for new trial? 
(Capitalization altered.) 
We hold that the ICA erred in holding that Father’s Hawaiʻi 
Family Court Rules (“HFCR”) Rule 52(b) (2015) motion to amend 
findings of fact and conclusions of law, enter additional findings of fact and conclusions of law, and to amend judgment accordingly (“motion to amend” or “HFCR Rule 52(b) motion to 
amend”) and motion for new trial pursuant to HFCR Rule 59 (2015) 
(“motion for new trial” or “HFCR Rule 59 motion for new trial”) were untimely. 
We also hold that the ICA erred in holding that the family 
court’s orders denying Father’s motion to amend and motion for new trial were void for lack of jurisdiction. 
We therefore reverse the ICA’s judgment on appeal except to 
the extent it affirmed the family court’s order denying Father’s 
 1   We are concurrently dismissing Father’s second application for  
certiorari in SCWC- 18-0000536 on the grounds it was improvidently granted.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
HFCR Rule 60(a) (2015) motion for relief from judgment, and we 
affirm the family court’s orders denying Father’s motion to 
amend and motion for new trial on the grounds relied upon by the 
family court.  
II. Background 
A. Factual background 
Father and Mother were married in 2008 and had two 
children, who were minors at the time of trial. In 2015, 
Father, Mother, and the children moved from Sacramento, 
California to Honolulu. While in Hawaiʻi, Father, Mother, and 
the children lived in a cottage located on Father’s parents’ 
property. 
On July 10, 2016, Mother took both children with her to 
Arizona due to family abuse by Father. On July 20, 2016, Mother filed for divorce in Arizona. On August 3, 2016, Father filed 
for divorce in Hawaiʻi. On September 2, 2016, Mother’s petition 
for divorce was dismissed. The family court ordered the 
children to be returned to Hawai ʻ
i by May 16, 2017, and Mother 
returned with the children.  
B. Family court proceedings Trial commenced on July 31, 2017 and ended on January 9, 
2018.
2 Near the end of the trial, Mother testified that she had 
2   The Honorable Gale L.F. Ching presided.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
accepted a job in Arizona, and that her start date was January 
2, 2018. She testified that she “cannot make it [in Hawaiʻi]” 
and had “no money.” Mother remained in Hawai
ʻi until the end of 
trial. 
In January 2018, shortly after the trial ended, Mother 
moved to Arizona to start her job. Because the family court had 
not yet ruled on child custody and relocation, the parties’ two 
minor children remained in Hawaiʻi with Father. 
On March 26, 2018, Father filed his notice of appeal in DL 
I. 
On April 3, 2018, the family court ordered both parties to 
submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. 
On 
April 20, 2018, Mother submitted four separate sets of proposed 
findings of fact, conclusions of law, and orders, and Father 
submitted 484 proposed findings of fact and 48 conclusions of 
law, not including subparts.    
On April 23, 2018, the family court entered four separate 
orders of findings of fact and conclusions of law (“April 23, 2018 FOFs/COLs”), adopting Mother’s proposals.  
On April 26, 2018, the family court entered a divorce 
decree (“Divorce Decree”) awarding Mother sole physical custody 
of the children and authorizing the children to relocate to 
Arizona after July 1, 2018.  
 5 
   
 
 
 
  
 
   
 
  
 
  
   
  
 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Later on April 26, 2018, the family court filed its first 
amended findings of fact and conclusions of law (“Amended 
FOF/COL”), which replaced the first of the four April 23, 2018 
FOFs/COLs.  There were no substantial changes to the April 23, 2018 findings. The family court found that Father had committed family violence, and that it was in the best interest of the 
children to relocate with Mother to Arizona. 
On May 7, 2018, Father submitted to the family court: (1) a 
HFCR Rule 52(b) motion to amend; (2) a HFCR Rule 59 motion for new trial; and (3) a HFCR Rule 60(a) motion for relief from 
judgment.
3 Father’s motions were stamped as “REC’D” on May 7, 
2018. However, the motions were not stamped as “filed” until May 22, 2018. 
Father’s HFCR Rule 52(b)
4 motion to amend argued that many 
of the family court’s findings were “contrary to the actual 
3 The family court denied Father’s motion for relief, and the ICA
affirmed the family court’s denial. DL v. CL III, CAAP- 18-0000630, at 7
(App. Dec. 26, 2019) (mem.) (“DL III”). Father does not raise the denial of 
his motion for relief as an issue on certiorari. Therefore, we do not
further discuss Father’s motion for relief. 
4 HFCR Rule 52(b) provides: 
Upon motion of a party made not later than 10 days after
entry of judgment the court may amend its findings or makeadditional findings and may amend the judgment accordingly.The motion may be made with a motion for a new trial
pursuant to Rule 59 of these rules. When findings of fact
are made by the court, the question of sufficiency of theevidence to support the findings may thereafter be raisedwhether or not the party raising the question has made inthe family court an objection to such findings or has made 
a motion to amend them or a motion for judgment .   
   
    
 
   
 
 
 
  
  
   
 
  
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 . . . . 
  (continued . . .) *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
uncontroverted evidence at trial” and that several findings were 
“unsupported by any credible evidence in the record.”  Father 
contended that nearly every finding of fact and conclusion of 
law in the April 23, 2018 FOFs/COLs and Amended FOF/COL should be stricken or amended.  Father then requested that the family court enter additional findings of fact and conclusions of law 
and amend its judgment, and he attached 491 proposed findings of 
fact and 40 conclusions of law substantively similar to the proposed findings and conclusions he had submitted to the court 
on April 20, 2018. 
Father stated that his motion for new trial was made 
pursuant to HFCR Rule 59,
5 Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (“HRS”) § 
571-50 (Supp. 1998),6 HRS § 635-56 (2016),7 and Waldecker v. 
5 HFCR Rule 59(a) provides: 
A new trial may be granted to all or any of the parties and
on all or part of the issues for good cause shown. On a motion for a new trial, the court may open the judgment ifone has been entered, take additional testimony, amendfindings of fact and conclusions of law, or make new
findings and conclusions, and direct the entry of a new
judgment. 
6 HRS § 571- 50 provides, in relevant part: 
Except as otherwise provided by this chapter, any decree ororder of the court may be modified at any time. 
A parent, guardian, custodian, or next friend of any childwhose status has been adjudicated by the co
urt, or any 
adult affected by a decree of the court, at any time maypetition the court for a rehearing on the ground that newevidence, which was not known or not available through the
exercise of due diligence at the time of the original

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
O’Scanlon, 137 Hawaiʻi 460, 375 P.3d 239 (2016). Father 
requested that the court order a new trial on physical child 
custody, legal child custody, visitation, relocation, child 
support, the division of the parties’ assets and debts, and 
attorney’s fees. Father argued the facts of the case had changed “in significant and material ways” since trial because 
Mother had moved to Arizona and the children had been living 
exclusively with him. 
On June 21, 2018, Mother filed oppositions to Father’s 
motion to amend and motion for new trial.  Mother argued that 
Father’s motion to amend should be denied because Father had the 
opportunity to present proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law after trial, which he actually did.  Mother argued 
Father’s motion for new trial should be denied because she had 
testified about her job offer in Arizona and the family court 
(. . .continued)
hearing and which might affect the decree, has been 
discovered. Upon a satisfactory showing of this evidence,the court shall order a new hearing and make anydisposition of the case that the facts and the best
interests of the child warrant. 
HRS § 635- 56 provides: 
In any civil case or in any criminal case wherein a verdictof guilty has been rendered, the court may set aside the
verdict when it appears to be so manifestly against theweight of the evidence as to indicate bias, prejudice,passion, or misunderstanding of the charge of the court on the part of the jury; or the court may in any civil or
criminal case grant a new trial for any legal cause. 7  
 8 
     
 On July 5, 2018, Father filed his second notice of appeal   
(“DL II”).  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
“knew there would likely be a separation between Mother and the 
children” if she returned to Arizona to start her new job. 
 
On July 11, 2018, a hearing was held on Father’s motion to 
amend and motion for new trial.  Near the end of the hearing, 
Father’s counsel brought the timeliness of Father’s motions to 
the attention of the court and the following exchange took place: 
[FATHER’S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, before we close the record, 
at the beginning I think you identified the motions ashaving been filed May 22. They were actually filedtechnically and received on May 7th. The importance isthat those are ten -day motions.  And so we just . . . want 
the record to be clear that they were timely. 
THE COURT: Okay. Yeah. I mean, it was – I’m just going by 
the date that the file stamp appears when I look at the
motion. 
[FATHER’S COUNSEL]: I understand.  I think on the original
copy it has the received stamp of May 7th, which is when they were actually submitted. And technically that was thefile date for purposes of compliance with the ten -day rule. 
THE COURT: I understand. Okay. Thank you. 
On July 16, 2018, the family court issued orders denying 
Father’s motion to amend and motion for new trial.  Both orders 
stated that the family court had reviewed the parties’ motions and memorandums, reviewed the files, heard the arguments of the 
parties, and was “fully informed of the facts and circumstances 
involved . . . .”  
 9 
  
 
  
 
    
 
 
 
  
   
 
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
On August 15, 2018, Father appealed the family court’s July 
16, 2018 orders. 
C. ICA proceedings 1. Father’s arguments 
Father argued the family court erred in denying his motion 
to amend because the family court lacked authority to enter the 
Amended FOF/COL pursuant to HFCR Rule 52, which he contended 
“expressly forbids the entry of any such findings if the previously entered order already contains them.” 
Father argued the family court erred in denying his motion 
for new trial because he had “raised significant and material new facts” regarding relocation, and it was an abuse of discretion for the court to “not consider all evidence relevant 
to the Children’s best interest.” 
2. Mother’s arguments 
Mother argued the family court properly denied Father’s 
motion to amend because the Amended FOF/COL was supported by the 
“voluminous testimony and evidence.” 
Mother asserted the family court properly denied Father’s 
motion for new trial because Mother had testified that she would 
likely have to leave the children with Father in Hawai ʻ
 i to 
accept a job offer in Arizona.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
3. The ICA’s memorandum opinion 
On December 26, 2019, the ICA filed its memorandum opinion. 
The ICA held that Father’s HFCR Rule 52(b) motion to amend was 
untimely. DL III, mem. op. at 5-6.  HFCR Rule 52 requires motions to amend the court’s findings to be made “not later than 10 days after entry of judgment . . . .” Because the family 
court entered the Divorce Decree on April 26, 2018, Father’s 
motion to amend was due on May 7, 2018.
8 DL III, mem. op. at 6.  
However, the ICA noted that Father’s motion to amend was not 
stamped as “filed” until May 22, 2018.  Id. The ICA also 
determined that Father’s July 5, 2018 notice of appeal for DL II 
divested the family court of jurisdiction to enter its July 16, 2018 order denying Father’s motion to amend. Id. (citing 
Lowther v. Lowther, 99 Hawaiʻi 569, 578, 57 P.3d 494, 503 (App. 
2002)). Therefore, the ICA held the order denying Father’s 
motion to amend was void. Id. 
The ICA similarly held that Father’s motion for new trial, 
stamped as “filed
” on May 22, 2018, was untimely because HFCR 
Rule 59(b) requires motions for new trial to be filed within ten 
days after entry of judgment, which would have been May 7, 2018.  
Ten days after April 26, 2018 was Sunday, May 6, 2018. Pursuant to 
HFCR Rule 6(a) (2015), in computing a period of time under the HFCR, “[t]he 
last day of the period so computed shall be included unless it is a Saturday,a Sunday or a holiday, in which event the period runs until the end of thenext day which is not a Saturday, a Sunday or a holiday.” Therefore,
Father’s filing deadline was Monday, May 7, 2018. 8  
 11 
   
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
DL III, mem. op. at 6-7. The ICA held the July 16, 2018 order 
denying Father’s motion for new trial was void because Father’s 
July 5, 2018 notice of appeal for DL II divested the family 
court of jurisdiction to rule on the motion. DL III, mem. op. 
at 7 (citing Lowther, 99 Hawaiʻi at 578, 57 P.3d at 503). 
In discussing how Father’s notice of appeal divested the 
family court of jurisdiction, the ICA noted that, “[h]ad 
[Father’s] HFCR Rule 52(b) motion been timely filed, a notice of appeal filed before timely disposition of the motion would have been null and void and the family court would have retained 
jurisdiction to decide the motion,” citing Richardson v. Sport 
Shinko (Waikiki Corp.), 76 Hawaiʻi 494, 502, 880 P.3d 169, 177 
(1994) (construing the 1985 version of Hawai ʻ
i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (“HRAP”) Rule 4(a)(4)). DL III, mem. op. at 6 n.8. 
Because the ICA determined the family court’s orders 
denying Father’s motion to amend and motion for new trial were 
void and that both motions were untimely, the ICA remanded “with 
instructions for the family court to enter orders denying both 
motions on that basis.” Id. 
On January 24, 2020, the ICA entered its judgment on 
appeal. D. Application for certiorari 
Father’s Application presents two questions:  
 12 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(1) Did the ICA gravely err in finding [Father’s] motions
untimely, and not reviewing the motions on theirmerits? 
(2) Did the ICA gravely err by not reviewing the familycourt’s denial of [Father’s] motion for new trial? 
(Capitalization altered.) 
Father asserts that his HFCR Rule 52(b) motion to amend and 
HFCR Rule 59(b) motion for new trial were timely because both 
were “received” by the family court on May 7, 2018, citing In re 
Doe, 101 Hawaiʻi 220, 227 n.14, 65 P.3d 167, 174 n.14 (2003) 
(stating that the clerk’s acceptance and date stamping of a 
motion as “received” constitutes a “filing” for the purposes of 
HFCR Rule 59). 
Father argues that, following his third notice of appeal, 
the family court was required to enter findings of fact and 
conclusions of law pursuant to HFCR Rule 52(a). Therefore, 
Father asserts there is no basis to review the family court’s 
orders for the proper exercise of discretion. Father also contends that there is “no reason to believe that the Family Court actually exercised discretion in deciding the Motions,” 
which constitutes an abuse of discretion.  Father argues his 
motion for new trial was also brought under HRS § 571 -50 and the 
family court’s “continuing authority to adjudicate the best 
interest of the children,” and that the ICA should have 
“reviewed the family court’s decision accordingly.”   
 13 
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
   
 
 
    
    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Finally, Father argues the ICA erred in holding the family 
court was divested of jurisdiction to decide his motion to amend 
and motion for new trial after he filed his notice of appeal in 
DL II. 
III. Standards of Review 
A. Family court decisions 
Generally, the family court possesses wide discretion in
making its decisions and those decisions will not be setaside unless there is a manifest abuse of discretion. Thus, we will not disturb the family court ’s decision on 
appeal unless the family court disregarded rules or 
principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment
of a party litigant and its decision clearly exceeded thebounds of reason. 
Brutsch v. Brutsch, 139 Hawaiʻi 373, 381, 390 P.3d 1260, 1268 
(2017) (quoting Kakinami v. Kakinami, 
127 Hawaiʻi 126, 136, 276 
P.3d 695, 705 (2012)). 
It is well established that a family court abuses its
discretion where “(1) the family court disregarded rules orprinciples of law or practice to the substantial detrimentof a party litigant; (2) the family court failed to exercise its equitable discretion; or (3) the family 
court’s decision clearly exceeds the bounds of reason.” 
Id. (quoting Kakinami, 127 Hawaiʻi at 155-56, 276 P.3d at 724-25) 
(emphasis omitted). 
B. New Trial “We review a court’s ruling upon a motion for new trial for 
an abuse of discretion.” Doe v. Doe, 98 Hawaiʻi 144, 150, 44 
P.3d 1085, 1091 (2002) (citing Shanghai Inv. Co., Inc. v. Alteka 
Co., 
92 Hawaiʻi 482, 491, 993 P.2d 516, 525 (2000). The family 
court may grant a motion for a new trial “to all or any of the  
 14 
     
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
 
 
    
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
parties and on all or part of the issues for good cause 
shown[.]” HFCR Rule 59(a). 
IV. Discussion 
A. The ICA erred in holding that Father’s HFCR Rule 52(b)
motion to amend and HFCR Rule 59 motion for new trial were untimely 
Father argues his HFCR Rule 52(b) motion to amend and HFCR 
Rule 59 motion for new trial were timely because they were submitted and stamped as “received” by the family court clerk on the May 7, 2018 deadline, even though they were not stamped as 
“filed” until May 22, 2018. 
In Doe, 98 Hawaiʻi at 150-51, 44 P.3d at 1091-92, this court 
held that the family court clerk’s acceptance and date stamping 
of a HFCR Rule 59 motion as “received” was “a filing that 
satisfied the jurisdictional requirements of HFCR Rule 59(a) 
and (e).” 
Pursuant to HFCR Rules 52(b) and 59(b), Father was 
required to file his motion to amend and motion for new trial within ten days after the family court entered the April 26, 
2018 Divorce Decree – May 7, 2018.  Father’s motion to amend and 
motion for new trial were both stamped as “received” by the family court clerk on May 7, 2018. Therefore, Father’s motion 
to amend and motion for new trial were timely, and the ICA erred in holding they were untimely.  
 15 
   
 
 
 The ICA held the family court’s orders denying Father’s
motions were void because the filing of Father’s notice of 
appeal in DL II divested the court of jurisdiction.  DL III,  
mem. op. at 6-7.    
 The general rule is that courts are divested of   
jurisdiction upon the filing of a notice of appeal.   Kakinami, 
127 Hawai
ʻi at 143, 276 P.3d at 712.  However, in Buscher v. 
Boning, 114 Hawaiʻ
i 202, 221, 159 P.3d 814, 833 (2007), this 
court held that the 1999 version of HRAP Rule 4(a)(3)    
“supersedes the line of cases standing for the proposition that 
the circuit court lacks jurisdiction to award costs after a 
notice of appeal is filed” and “provides that the court has 90 days to dispose of a postjudgment motion [to reconsider, vacate,9
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 9 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
B. The family court had jurisdiction to enter the July 16, 
2018 orders 
 
 
 
HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) (1999) provided: 
If, not later than 10 days after entry of judgment,
any party files a motion that seeks to reconsider, vacate,
or alter the judgment, or seeks attorney’s fee’ or costs,the time for filing the notice of appeal is extended until 
30 days after entry of an order disposing of the motion;provided, that the failure to dispose of any motion by
order entered upon the record within 90 days after the date
the motion was filed shall constitute a denial of the motion. 
All timely post- judgment motions shall be disposed of 
by order entered upon the record at the same time. The 
notice of appeal shall be deemed to appeal disposition of
all post- judgment motions that are filed within 10 days 
after entry of judgment.
The 90- day period shall be computed as provided in 
Rule 26.  
 16 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
   10 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
or alter the judgment, or seeks attorney’s fees or] costs,    
regardless of when the notice of appeal was filed.”   Although 
HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) has since been amended,  the language 
providing that a court has 90 days to dispose of a timely post -
judgment motion has not changed substantively.    The family court
denied Father’s motion to amend and motion for new trial  on July
16, 2018 –  within 90 days after the motions were filed on May 7,  
2018.  Therefore, the ICA erred in holding that the family 
court’s orders denying Father’s motion to amend and motion for 
new trial were void for lack of jurisdiction.  10
 
 
 
HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) (2016), the rule in effect when Father filed his
motion to amend, motion for new trial, and notice of appeal, provided: 
If any party f iles a timely motion for judgment as a 
matter of law, to amend findings or make additional
findings, for a new trial, to reconsider, alter or amend
the judgment or order, or for attorney’s fees or costs, and
court or agency rules specify the time by which the motion shall be filed, then the time for filing the notice of 
appeal is extended for all parties until 30 days afterentry of an order disposing of the motion.   The presiding 
court or agency in which the motion was filed shall disposeof any such post- judgment motion by entering an order upon 
record within 90 days after the date the motion was filed.   
If the court or agency fails to enter an order on therecord, then, within 5 days after the 90th day, the clerk
of the relevant court or agency shall notify the parties 
that, by operation of this Rule, the post -judgment motion 
is denied and that any orders entered thereafter shall be anullity. 
The time of appeal shall run from the date of
entry of the court or agency’s order disposing of the  post-
judgment motion, if the order is entered within the 90days, or from the filing date of the clerk’s notice to theparties that the post -judgment motion is denied pursuant to 
the operation of the Rule.  
The notice of appeal shall be deemed to appeal the

Additionally, the ICA stated that, “[h]ad [Father’s] HFCR 
Rule 52(b) motion been timely filed, a notice of appeal filed 
before timely disposition of the motion would have been null and 
void,” citing Richardson, 76 Hawaiʻi at 502, 880 P.2d at 177. DL 
III, mem. op. at 6 n.8 (emphasis added).  However, Richardson 
construed the 1985 version of HRAP Rule 4(a)(4), which 
specifically stated that “[a] notice of appeal filed before the 
disposition of any of the above motions shall have no effect.” 
Richardson, 76 Hawaiʻi at 500-02, 880 P.2d at 175-77.  HRAP 
Rule 4 was amended to remove this language prior to the filing of the notice of appeal in this case.  See HRAP Rule 4(a) 
(2016). Therefore, Richardson no longer controls due to the amendments to HRAP Rule 4(a). C. The family court did not abuse its discretion in denying 
Father’s motion to amend and motion for new trial 
Father argues the family court “may” have abused its 
discretion by denying his motion to amend and motion for new trial because it incorrectly believed they were untimely.  The record does not support this speculative contention. At the 
July 11, 2018 hearing on Father’s motions, Father’s counsel 
specifically brought the motions’ timeliness to the attention of the family court.  Father’s counsel stated, “I think on the original copy [of the motions] it has the received stamp of May 
7th, which is when they were actually submitted. And  
 18 
  
   
 
 
  
 
   
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
technically that was the file date for purposes of compliance 
with the ten-day rule.”  The family court responded, “I 
understand. Okay. Thank you.” Furthermore, the court’s orders 
ruled on the merits of Father’s motions and did not state that the motions were untimely. 
Father also argues that there is “no basis to believe that 
the Family Court actually evaluated [Father’s] motion[s] and supporting evidence, and actually exercised discretion in denying it.” However, the family court’s orders stated that the 
court had reviewed the motions and memorandums, and a hearing 
was held on both motions. Therefore, the orders indicated that the family court evaluated the written submissions, referenced the hearing on both motions at which extensive arguments were 
presented, and denied Father’s motions based upon its review of 
the merits of the motions. 
Father contends that the family court was required to enter 
findings of fact and conclusions of law after he filed his third notice of appeal pursuant to HFCR Rule 52(a).  HFCR Rule 52(a) provides that, upon notice of appeal, “the court shall enter its findings of fact and conclusions of law where none have been 
entered . . . .” In this case, the family court entered

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
complete findings of fact and conclusions of law on April 23, 
2018.11 Therefore, Father’s argument is without merit. 
1. The family court did not abuse its discretion in
denying Father’s motion to amend 
Father’s HFCR Rule 52 motion to amend argued the family 
court’s findings were “unsupported by any credible evidence in 
the record.” Father challenged nearly every finding and conclusion in the April 23, 2018 FOFs/COLs and the Amended 
FOF/COL, and he attached proposed findings of fact and 
conclusions of law substantively similar to those he had submitted to the court on April 20, 2018. 
The family court did not adopt Father’s April 20, 2018 
proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. However, the family court considered and held a hearing on Father’s motion to amend, which asked the court to enter findings and conclusions 
substantively similar to those Father had previously proposed.  
To the extent Father argues the evidence supporting the family court’s findings and conclusions was not credible, appellate courts “will not pass upon issues dependent upon the credibility 
of witnesses and the weight of the evidence . . . .” Fisher v. 
Fisher, 111 Hawaiʻi 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006). Therefore, 
On April 26, 2018, the family court filed its first amended findings of 
fact and conclusions of law, which did not amend the April 23, 2018 findings 
of fact and conclusions of law, but merely added a child support guidelines 
worksheet and property division chart as attachments . 11

the family court did not abuse its discretion by denying 
Father’s motion to amend. 
2. The family court did not abuse its discretion in 
denying Father’s motion for new trial 
Father argues that his motion for new trial was brought 
pursuant to HFCR Rule 59, HRS § 571-50, and “the Family Court’s 
ongoing powers confirmed in [Waldecker, 137 Hawaiʻi at 470, 375 
P.3d at 249],”12 and that the ICA “should have reviewed the 
family court’s decision accordingly.” 
Father’s motion for new trial argued that the facts had 
materially changed since the conclusion of trial due to Mother’s 
move to Arizona, and therefore a new trial should be held to 
determine the best interest of the children. Father also argued 
that the family court’s findings, including findings of family 
violence, were unsupported by the evidence. 
The family court did not abuse its discretion by denying 
Father’s motion for new trial under HFCR Rule 59 (providing a motion for a new trial may be granted “on all or part of the issues for good cause shown[.]”).  Mother testified at trial 
that she would likely move to Arizona to start her job in 
January 2018.  The family court knew Mother had actually moved 
While Waldecker provides that “any custody award shall be subject to 
modification or change whenever the best interests of the child require or 
justify the modification or change,” it does not discuss motions for new
trial. 137 Hawaiʻ i at 470, 375 P.3d at 249 (quoting HRS § 571 -46 (Supp. 
2013)). 12

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
to Arizona and that Father was taking care of the children prior 
to entering the Divorce Decree.13 The family court also 
considered Father’s motion for new trial and held a hearing on the motion. 
The family court also did not abuse its discretion in 
denying Father’s motion for new trial pursuant to HRS § 571-50.  
HRS § 571-50 provides: 
A parent . . . of any child whose status has been
adjudicated by the court . . . at any time may petition the court for a rehearing on the ground that new evidence, 
which was not known or not available through the exercise
of due diligence at the time of the original hearing and which might affect the decree, has been discovered.  Upon asatisfactory showing of this evidence, the court shallorder a new hearing and make any disposition of the case
that the facts and the best interests of the child warrant. 
(Emphasis added.) 
Father argues that Mother’s move to Arizona and his months 
taking care of the children constitute “new evidence.” However, 
as previously discussed, Mother testified at trial that she 
would probably need to move to Arizona to start her new job. 
Father also testified that he would be able to care for the children if Mother moved to Arizona.  The family court was aware that Mother had moved and that the children were in Father’s 
care when it entered the Divorce Decree, meaning Father’s “new 
evidence” did not actually “affect the decree.”  See HRS 
At a March 14, 2018 hearing on Mother’s motion for pre -decree relief, 
Mother’s counsel explained to the family court that Mother was currently
living in Arizona and that she had been visiting the children in Hawaiʻ i on 
alternating weekends. 
The family court issued the Divorce Decree a month
later on April 26, 2018. 13

§ 571-50.  Therefore, Father did not make a satisfactory showing of new evidence requiring the family court to order a new 
hearing under HRS § 571-50. 
V. Conclusion 
We therefore reverse the ICA’s judgment on appeal except to 
the extent it affirmed the family court’s order denying Father’s HFCR Rule 60(a) motion for relief from judgment, and we affirm 
the family court’s orders denying Father’s motion to amend and motion for new trial. Philip Leas
