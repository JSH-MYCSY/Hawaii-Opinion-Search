SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, and Wilson, JJ., and 
Circuit Judge Remigio, assigned by reason of vacancy) 
I. INTRODUCTION
Jerrico Lindsey was convicted of second-degree murder 
and several other charges in 2009.  While serving his sentence 
at a correctional facility in Arizona, Lindsey filed a Hawai ‘i 
Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40 petition alleging that 
he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial.  
Lindsey’s petition was devoid of any factual allegations, 
stating simply that he intended to amend the petition after the 
court appointed an attorney for him pursuant to a concurrently-Electronically Filed

2 filed motion for appointment of counsel.  Seven months later, 
the State filed its response to Lindsey’s petition; upon 
receiving the State’s response, Lindsey moved to withdraw his 
petition so he could amend it to include factual allegations.  
However, unbeknownst to Lindsey, the Circuit Court of the First 
Circuit (circuit court)  had dismissed his petition as “patently
frivolous and without a trace of support, either on the record, or from the evidence submitted[.]”  The circuit court subsequently denied Lindsey’s motion to withdraw the petition, 
and the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) affirmed.   1  
  Lindsey seeks review of the ICA’s decision on the ground that he was entitled to amend his petition under HRPP 
Rule 40(e), which states, “The court may grant leave to amend or 
withdraw the petition at any time.  Amendment shall be freely 
allowed in order to achieve substantial justice.  No petition 
shall be dismissed for want of particularity unless the 
petitioner is first given an opportunity to clarify the petition.”   
  Although it is typically appropriate to deny a motion 
to withdraw filed after the dismissal of a Rule 40 petition, in 
the specific context of this case, Lindsey’s motion should have 
been construed as a motion to reconsider, and we hold that the 
                     
1  The Honorable Edwin C. Nacino presided.  ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
3 circuit court erred in dismissing Lindsey’s Rule 40 petition 
without first providing him an opportunity to clarify his 
claims.  Thus, we vacate the ICA’s Summary Disposition Order 
(SDO) and the circuit court’s order and remand to the circuit 
court for further proceedings.   
II. BACKGROUND 
A.  Circuit Court Proceedings 
  Throughout his Rule 40 proceedings, Lindsey was 
incarcerated in Eloy, Arizona.  It appears that all of his 
filings were submitted through the prison’s mail system, and he 
received notice of the State’s response and the court’s orders 
in the same way.   
  Lindsey’s Rule 40 petition challenged his conviction 
on the ground that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective. In the space on the petition form for supporting facts, Lindsey 
wrote, “Facts to be developed in amended petition.  Desire 
review by Court Appointed Attorney to determine issues.”  No 
other factual allegations were included in the petition.   
  Lindsey concurrently filed a motion for appointment of 
counsel.  In the motion, Lindsey stated that he was unable to 
afford an attorney to handle the complex issues involved in his petition, contended that his attack on his conviction would 
involve interviewing newly discovered witnesses and “conflicting 
testimony,” and argued that counsel would “better enable” ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
4 Lindsey to argue his case.   
  The State filed a response to Lindsey’s petition 
approximately seven months later.  The State contended that the 
lack of factual support for Lindsey’s allegations that he 
received ineffective assistance of counsel justified dismissal 
of his petition.   
  On May 3, 2018, ten days after the State filed its 
response, the circuit court dismissed Lindsey’s Rule 40 petition and denied his motion for appointment of counsel.
2  
  On May 4, 2018 - before Lindsey claims to have learned that the circuit court had dismissed his petition - he filed a 
motion to withdraw his petition without prejudice.  In the 
motion, Lindsey stated that he was seeking to withdraw the 
petition so that he could “formulate . . . an [amended] petition 
correctly so his [amended] petition claims can be adjudicated 
for the relief entitled[.]”   
  On July 30, 2018, “in accordance [with] the Order Denying Rule 40 Petition for Post-Conviction Relief Without a 
Hearing previously filed on May 3, 2018,” the circuit court 
denied Lindsey’s motion to withdraw petition.  Lindsey appealed.   
                     
2  Although the order disposing of Lindsey’s petition was titled 
“Order Denying Rule 40 Petition for Post- Conviction Relief Without a 
Hearing, ” the circuit court explained that the petition was “patently 
frivolous and without a trace of support, either on the record, or from the 
evidence submitted[.] ”  HRPP Rule 40(g)(2) states that “[t]he court may 
dismiss a petition at any time upon finding the petition is patently 
frivolous[.]”  (Emphasis added.)  As such, we conclude that the circuit court 
dismissed Lindsey’s Rule 40 petition.   ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
5 B.  ICA Proceedings  
  Lindsey argued that he was entitled to withdraw his 
petition pursuant to HRPP Rule 40(e).  He also contended that 
the circuit court erred by dismissing the petition “for want of 
particularity” without giving him “an opportunity to clarify the petition” and that the circuit court’s dismissal of his petition 
on May 3, 2018 deprived him of the opportunity to reply to the 
State’s Response.   
  In its Answering Brief, the State first contended that 
the ICA lacked appellate jurisdiction to review the dismissal of 
Lindsey’s petition because Lindsey did not file his notice of 
appeal until more than sixty days after the circuit court 
dismissed his Rule 40 petition.  Further, the State argued that 
Lindsey’s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and newly discovered witnesses in the Rule 40 petition lacked a factual 
basis.   
  Additionally, the State argued that “Lindsey does not 
cite any authority that would give the circuit court the 
discretion to allow the withdrawal of a Rule 40 petition that is 
devoid of any factual allegations that would support a colorable 
claim for relief.”     Lindsey filed a reply brief, contending that:  
 Respondent’ s error was in claiming that Appellant was 
appealing the Circuit Court’ s denial of his Rule 40 
Petition.  In fact, Appellant’ s “Notice of Appeal” (like 
his O.B.) was addressing the solitary issue of the Circuit ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
6 Court’s incorrect denial of his Motion to Withdraw Rule 40 
Petition, which was filed on July 30, 2018, arrived at 
Saguaro Correctional Center on August 2, 2018, and received 
by Appellant on August 3, 2018.    
 
(Emphasis added.)  
  In its SDO filed June 4, 2020, the ICA rejected the 
State’s contention that it lacked appellate jurisdiction, pointing out that Lindsey appealed the denial of his motion to 
withdraw, not the dismissal of the petition itself.  The notice 
of appeal of the denial of the motion to withdraw was timely.   
  The ICA compared the use of the words “shall” and 
“may” in HRPP Rule 40(e), and concluded that, while the circuit 
court was required to grant leave to amend, granting withdrawal 
was discretionary.  As such, the ICA considered whether the denial of Lindsey’s motion to withdraw his petition so that he 
could amend it was an abuse of the circuit court’s discretion.  
The ICA additionally recognized that Lindsey “had more than 
seven months to request” that his petition be withdrawn, but he 
had only done so ten days after the State filed its answering 
brief, and one day after the circuit court dismissed his 
petition.  The ICA thus affirmed the circuit court’s order.   
C.  Application for Writ of Certiorari   
  Lindsey’s application for writ of certiorari contends 
that the ICA erred in its interpretation of HRPP Rule 40(e).  
Lindsey argues that he should have been permitted to withdraw 
his petition in order to amend it pursuant to the language of ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
7 the rule stating that “[a]mendment shall be freely allowed in 
order to achieve substantial justice.”   
  The State did not file a response.  
III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW  
A. Denial of Rule 40 Petition Without a Hearing  
 “[A] hearing should be held on a Rule 40 petition for 
post-conviction relief where the petition states a colorable 
claim.  To establish a colorable claim, the allegations of the 
petition must show that if taken as true the facts alleged would 
change the verdict[.]”  Dan v. State, 76 Hawai‘ i 423, 427, 879 
P.2d 528, 532 (1994) (quoting State v. Allen, 7 Haw. App. 89, 
92, 744 P.2d 789, 792 (1987)).  The question of whether a Rule 
40 petition establishes a colorable claim is a question of law 
that we review de novo.  Id. 
B.  Denial of Motion to Withdraw Rule 40 Petition  
  HRPP Rule 40(e) states in relevant part, “The court 
may grant leave to amend or withdraw the petition at any time.  
Amendment shall be freely allowed in order to achieve 
substantial justice.”  Although we have not had occasion to 
consider the standard of review of a court’s decision denying a motion to amend or withdraw a Rule 40 petition, the language of 
the rule suggests that granting a motion to withdraw is a matter 
within the court’s discretion.  Matters within the discretion of 
the trial court are reviewed on appeal for abuse of discretion.  ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
8 See, e.g., Miyamoto v. Lum, 104 Hawai‘ i 1, 6, 84 P.3d 509, 514 
(2004) (noting that ruling on a motion for a new trial is within 
the trial court’s discretion and that ruling will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of discretion).  
IV. DISCUSSION  
A. There is Typically No Error in Denying a Motion to Withdraw 
an HRPP Rule 40 Petition Filed After the Circuit Court Has 
Dismissed the Petition 
  Lindsey gave his motion to withdraw to prison 
officials for mailing one day after the circuit court dismissed his petition.  This court has recognized that the “prison 
mailbox rule” allows inmates’ filings to be considered filed as 
of the date the inmate gives the filing to prison officials for 
mailing to the court.  Setala v. J.C. Penney Co., 97 Hawai‘ i 484, 
486-87, 40 P.3d 886, 888-89 (2002).  Nonetheless, this rule is 
of no help to Lindsey because the circuit court dismissed his 
petition even before Lindsey handed his motion to withdraw the 
petition to prison officials.   
  This court has not previously addressed whether a “reverse” mailbox rule may offer a prisoner relief where, as 
here, the petitioner had not previously learned of the circuit court’s order dismissing his petition prior to filing his motion 
to withdraw.  Even if we were to recognize such a rule, however, 
it would be immaterial to the outcome here because generally, 
delayed delivery of mail to prisoners may only toll filing ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
9 deadlines if the delay was caused by the prison.  See United 
States v. Fiorelli, 337 F.3d 282, 289 (3d Cir. 2003) (“[O]nly 
delays caused by the prison warrant tolling of the filing 
deadlines, and to the extent that the delay represents slow 
mail, there is nothing that this Court can do to preserve an 
appellant’s right to appellate review.” (quotation marks, 
citation, and brackets omitted)); United States v. Grana, 864 
F.2d 312, 316 (3d Cir. 1989) (“[W]e hold that in computing the 
timeliness of pro se prisoners’ appeals, any prison delay in 
transmitting to the prisoner notice of the district court’s final order or judgment shall be excluded from the computation 
of an appellant’s time for taking an appeal.” (emphasis added)).   
  The limitation on the reverse mailbox rule is both sensible and fair; a litigant who is not incarcerated and who 
does not use e-filing is also unlikely to learn of a court’s 
order until notice arrives in the mail, likely several days 
after the order is filed.  In those circumstances, the litigant would not be entitled to tolling of deadlines that began when 
the court entered an order.  Where a person’s incarceration 
causes additional delays in receiving notice of a court’s order, 
beyond normal mail schedules, that person may be entitled to 
tolling or, as here, additional time after entry of a court’s 
order to file a motion that would otherwise be moot.  That is 
not the situation in Lindsey’s case.  Lindsey’s motion was filed ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
10 the day after the court entered its order dismissing his 
petition.  His lack of notice of the court’s order cannot be 
attributed to prison officials.  Thus, Lindsey would not benefit 
from a reverse mailbox rule even if we were to adopt it.   
  Generally speaking, it is not an abuse of discretion for a court to deny a motion to withdraw a Rule 40 petition 
after the petition has been dismissed.  “Unless there is 
prejudice to the state, a movant for postconviction relief is entitled to withdraw a motion before it is ruled on.”  39 Am. 
Jur. 2d Habeas Corpus § 168 (2021) (emphasis added).  But after 
the court rules on the petition, a motion to withdraw is moot.  
Civil Beat L. Ctr. for the Pub. Int., Inc. v. City & Cnty. of 
Honolulu, 144 Hawai‘ i 466, 476, 445 P.3d 47, 57 (2019) (“A case 
is moot if it has lost its character as a present, live 
controversy of the kind that must exist if courts are to avoid 
advisory opinions on abstract propositions of law.” (citation 
omitted)).  After ruling on a Rule 40 petition, there remains no 
“present, live controversy” before the court, and the court 
would be unable to effectuate the requested remedy of granting leave to withdraw the petition.   
B.  The Circuit Court Erred by Dismissing Lindsey’s Petition 
Without First Providing Lindsey an Opportunity to Clarify 
His Petition  
  HRPP Rule 40(e) states that a petition shall not be 
dismissed for want of particularity unless the petitioner is ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
11 first given an opportunity to clarify the petition.  Lindsey was 
not provided an opportunity to clarify or amend his petition 
prior to the circuit court’s May 3, 2018 order dismissing the 
petition.   
1.  The motion to withdraw is best construed as a motion 
 for reconsideration under the circumstances of this 
 case  
  “[A]n appellant’s failure to file a timely notice of 
appeal is a jurisdictional defect [that] can neither be waived 
by the parties nor disregarded by the court in the exercise of 
judicial discretion.”  Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 
P.2d 1127, 1129 (1986) (quotation marks and citation omitted) (brackets in original).  Lindsey’s notice of appeal states that 
he appeals “from the decision and order denying petitioner’s 
motion to withdraw petition for post-conviction relief without prejudice[.]”  The notice of appeal was timely filed within 30 
days of the circuit court’s denial of Lindsey’s motion to 
withdraw and was therefore timely.   
  Under the circumstances of this case, Lindsey’s motion to withdraw should have been treated as a reconsideration 
motion.  Lindsey filed his motion to withdraw one day after the 
circuit court dismissed his petition.  Although styled as a 
“motion to withdraw,” it specifically asked for the opportunity 
to “formulate . . . an [amended] petition correctly so his 
[amended] petition claims can be adjudicated for the relief [to ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
12 which he is] entitled[.]”  Lindsey’s original petition likewise 
explained that he intended to amend the petition with the help 
of court-appointed counsel.  When the motion was filed, the 
court had already dismissed Lindsey’s petition, concluding that 
the petition was “patently frivolous and without a trace of 
support, either on the record, or from the evidence submitted”; 
in light of this disposition, a fair reading of Lindsey’s 
request to withdraw his petition was that Lindsey was asking the court to reconsider its decision to summarily dismiss the 
petition for a lack of factual support.  Thus, because Lindsey’s 
original petition contemplated developing the facts at a later 
time, and the motion to withdraw specifically asked for the 
opportunity to reformulate his claims, Lindsey’s motion should 
have been interpreted liberally by the circuit court as a 
reconsideration motion.  See Dupree v. Hiraga, 121 Hawai‘ i 297, 
314, 219 P.3d 1084, 1101 (2009) (“[Filings] prepared by pro se 
litigants should be interpreted liberally.”).   
2.  The circuit court erred by dismissing the petition 
 without giving Lindsey an opportunity to clarify  
   “[A] hearing should be held on a Rule 40 petition for 
post-conviction relief where the petition states a colorable 
claim.  To establish a colorable claim, the allegations of the 
petition must show that if taken as true the facts alleged would 
change the verdict[.]”  Dan, 76 Hawai‘ i at 427, 879 P.2d at 532 ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
13 (quoting Allen, 7 Haw. App. at 92, 744 P.2d at 792).  Moreover, 
“[n]o petition shall be dismissed for want of particularity 
unless the petitioner is first given an opportunity to clarify 
the petition.”  HRPP Rule 40(e).  “If the court considered [the 
petitioner’s] statements unclear or lacking in detail, HRPP Rule 
40(e) requires the court to give the petitioner an opportunity 
to clarify the petition prior to dismissing it for want of 
particularity.”  Fagaragan v. State, 132 Hawai‘ i 224, 236, 320 
P.3d 889, 901 (2014) (footnote omitted).   
  Lindsey’s petition was bare-bones and contained no 
factual allegations to support the claim of ineffective 
assistance of counsel, specifying only that he intended to amend it later with the help of legal counsel.  Lindsey’s 
concurrently-filed motion for appointment of counsel explained 
that Lindsey believed counsel would “better enable” him to 
prepare his case.   
  The State argued that Lindsey was given sufficient 
time to amend his petition.  However, Lindsey’s petition and his 
motion for appointment of counsel evinced Lindsey’s intent to first have counsel appointed before amending his petition.  It 
is thus reasonable to assume that Lindsey had not sought 
amendment during the seven months that elapsed prior to the 
State filing its answer to Lindsey’s petition because Lindsey 
was waiting until the circuit court first ruled on his motion ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
14 for appointment of counsel.  Because Lindsey’s petition 
expressly stated that he “desired review” by court-appointed 
counsel before amending the petition to contain specific facts 
about his claim, the State’s argument that Lindsey was given a 
sufficient amount of time to amend is unpersuasive.    3
   The State additionally argued that Lindsey’s petition “failed to allege any facts” – in other words, that the lack of 
particularity warranted dismissal.  And the circuit court’s order dismissing the petition stated only that Lindsey’s 
petition was frivolous and without support in the record, giving 
no other reasoning.  Thus, we can fairly infer that the circuit 
court’s dismissal was for want of particularity.   
 
 Pursuant to Rule 40(e), the circuit court should have 
given Lindsey an opportunity to clarify the factual allegations in the petition before dismissing it.  Taking into account the 
circumstances of Lindsey’s petition, it was error not to do so.  
Lindsey had informed the court that he was waiting on the disposition of his motion for appointment of counsel before 
amending the petition to contain more specific facts.  
Additionally, once Lindsey received the State’s answer to his 
petition, Lindsey filed - albeit after the Court filed its order 
                     
3  Whether the circuit court would have appointed counsel pursuant 
to HRPP Rule 40(i) is not dispositive here; it is clear that Lindsey was 
waiting for the circuit court’s disposition of his motion for appointment of 
counsel before amending his petition. ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
15 dismissing his petition and denying his motion for court-
appointed counsel - the motion to withdraw the petition, which 
contended that he “need[ed] to formulate in an [amended] 
petition” the facts supporting his claims.  It is clear that 
Lindsey intended to amend his petition to provide the factual 
basis of his claim, and the circuit court thus erred in 
dismissing his petition without first giving Lindsey the 
opportunity to do so.  Accordingly, Lindsey’s motion, which asked the circuit court for the opportunity to reformulate his 
petition to develop the facts, should have been granted.   
V. CONCLUSION  
  In sum, we hold that the circuit court’s May 3, 2018 
order dismissing Lindsey’s petition for post-conviction relief 
was premature.  The circuit court failed to provide Lindsey with 
an opportunity to clarify his petition prior to its order 
dismissing the petition, as required by HRPP Rule 40(e).  Under 
the circumstances of this case, the motion to withdraw, which should have been construed as a motion to reconsider the circuit 
court’s dismissal of Lindsey’s petition, should have been 
granted.  
  Accordingly, we vacate the ICA’s July 7, 2020 judgment 
on appeal, and the circuit court’s July 30, 2018 order denying 
petitioner’s motion to withdraw petition for post-conviction 
relief without prejudice.  We remand to the circuit court for ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
