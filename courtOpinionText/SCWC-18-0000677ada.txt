CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS  
(CAAP-18-0000677; CASE NO. 1CC171002012)  
 
JULY 29, 2025 
 
RECKTENWALD, C.J., McKENNA, EDDINS, GINOZA, AND DEVENS, JJ., 
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY EDDINS, J.  
This case involves whether a skilled nursing facility may 
initiate an administrative hearing contesting the Department of 
Human Services’ termination of its Medicaid-recipient resident’s 
eligibility. 
A skilled nursing facility accepted a new resident 
receiving Medicaid benefits. Upon admission, the resident’s  
   
   
    
 
  
  
  
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
husband was designated as her authorized representative. Thus, 
he was authorized to communicate with the Department of Human 
Services (DHS) (the agency that administers Hawaiʻ i’s Medicaid 
program) on her behalf. 
Nearly two years after her admission to the facility, DHS 
realized the resident had too many assets to qualify for 
Medicaid. It ended her benefits. When her benefits were 
terminated, the resident and her husband (her authorized 
representative) had been deemed incapacitated.  Husband had a 
public guardian, and the State was in the process of appointing 
the resident a guardian. 
The nursing facility found out the resident was no longer 
eligible for Medicaid because its bills stopped getting paid. It is unclear whether notice of ineligibility was issued at the 
time, and to whom. 
After the State appointed the resident a public guardian, 
the guardian submitted a new Medicaid application on her behalf. 
DHS denied the application. DHS said it sent out a denial 
notice, but no one knows who the notice was sent to. DHS said it made a mistake – the resident was never eligible for Medicaid 
because she still had a home in trust. (The family refused to 
work with the facility to satisfy the medical debt with trust 
assets or to place a lien on the home.) 
2  
 
 
 
  
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The nursing home cared for the resident without 
compensation for almost another two years, until she passed 
away. 
DHS refused to compensate the facility.  Nearly two years 
after the resident’s death, the nursing home sought an 
administrative hearing to challenge DHS’ 2013 eligibility 
decision. The appeals office denied the request because the 
nursing home was not an authorized representative, and the appeal came too late. (The authorized representative, her 
husband, was also deceased.) 
The circuit court and Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) 
affirmed the denial and held that the nursing home lacked 
standing to challenge DHS’ eligibility determination because it 
was not the applicant (the resident) or an authorized 
representative per Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 346-12 
(2015). 
We disagree with the lower courts regarding standing. We 
hold that skilled nursing facilities have constitutionally-
protected property interests in compensation for medical services performed for residents in reliance on Department of 
Human Services eligibility determinations. 
Based on this 
property interest, these facilities have due process rights 
under article I, section 5 of the Hawaiʻi Constitution.

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Skilled nursing facilities are entitled to notice and the 
opportunity to appeal Medicaid eligibility determinations when 
(1) the facility has provided care for an individual approved 
for Medicaid benefits, (2) the beneficiary is unable to appeal a 
later determination of Medicaid ineligibility due to incapacity, 
and (3) no authorized representative is available or willing to 
appeal the eligibility denial on behalf of the beneficiary. 
I. 
Aloha Nursing Rehab Centre (Aloha), a nursing home 
specializing in skilled nursing and hospice care, accepted FT as 
a permanent resident in March 2011. 
It accepted her based on 
the Department of Human Services determination that she was Medicaid eligible. FT’s authorized representative, her husband, 
signed a facility services agreement authorizing the release of 
information to Aloha and assigning payment of FT’s Medicaid 
benefits to Aloha. 
In July 2012, FT’s husband’s healthcare provider filed an 
emergency petition asking the court to find him incapacitated and appoint the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) as his 
guardian. In November 2012, the court did so.  From then on, 
FT’s authorized representative lacked capacity to act on her 
behalf. 
In September 2012, Aloha filed a petition asking the court 
to find FT incapacitated and appoint OPG. In January 2013, the 
4  
  
  
  
  
   
  
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
court found FT incapacitated and appointed OPG as her guardian. 
Because of the guardianship proceedings, the State knew that 
both FT and her husband lacked capacity. 
In November 2012, before OPG was appointed as FT’s 
guardian, DHS terminated FT’s Medicaid benefits. Although it 
did not receive a formal notice, Aloha found out about the 
situation because its bills stopped getting paid. FT had a 
house in trust, so she was over the Medicaid income limit. 
Aloha tried to work with FT’s family to get the house out 
of trust and make her eligible again, but was unsuccessful. 
In June 2013, OPG submitted a new application for Medicaid 
benefits on FT’s behalf. In July 2013, DHS sent a denial notice 
explaining that FT’s home made her ineligible. To whom DHS sent 
this notice is unknown. 
In June 2014, FT died. In June 2015, Aloha wrote to FT’s 
adult children, in their capacities as co-conservators of FT’s 
trust containing the house. Aloha claimed that its debt was enforceable against trust assets, namely, the house. It asked 
the children to cooperate by placing a lien on the house; 
otherwise it would sue. 
In September 2015, Aloha sued the trust, demanding that 
trust assets satisfy Aloha’s debt. In June 2016, Aloha withdrew 
its suit after repeatedly being unable to serve the only child 
who served as the trustee. 
5  
  
  
  
  
   
  
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Unable to get assets from the trust, Aloha met with DHS in 
February 2016, seeking reimbursement for its care from 2012, 
when FT was declared ineligible for Medicaid, until her death in 
2014. DHS refused, explaining “that they had made a mistake and 
that FT should never have been Medicaid eligible” because her 
home was in a revocable trust the entire time. 
In April 2016, Aloha sent a letter asking DHS for 
$121,831.99 in reimbursement. DHS responded in June 2016, denying Aloha’s request. In July 2016, Aloha asked DHS to 
reconsider its denial. DHS rejected that request in August 
2016. 
In September 2016, Aloha requested a hearing with the DHS 
Administrative Appeals Office (AAO). Aloha argued that the 
hardship and lack of notice justified waiving the denial of 
eligibility.  The AAO dismissed the hearing request for two 
reasons: Aloha was not authorized to represent FT, and the 
hearing request was submitted over ninety days from the termination of benefits notice. 
Aloha appealed. In March 2017, the circuit court reversed 
the AAO’s decision to dismiss Aloha’s request for a hearing. It 
remanded to the AAO to determine whether Aloha had standing to 
litigate on FT’s behalf. 
On remand, the AAO sided with DHS. Because Aloha had not 
produced evidence to establish that it was FT’s authorized 
6  
  
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
representative, it had no right to contest DHS’ denial of its 
request for payment. That FT and her authorized representative 
were both incapacitated didn’t matter - FT had a legal guardian 
(OPG) from January 29, 2013 until her death. Thus, the hearings 
officer said, Aloha did not have standing, third-party or 
otherwise, to request a hearing. 
In July 2018, the circuit court affirmed the AAO’s 
decision. The court concluded that Aloha lacked standing to initiate a contested case hearing. The relevant statute, HRS 
§ 346-12, limits parties who can request such a hearing solely 
to the applicant or recipient themselves. The statute does not 
extend to third parties, the circuit court said. It also 
concluded that Aloha’s relationship to FT was not a “close 
relationship” for third-party standing purposes, but rather 
“that of a creditor and debtor under a contract.” 
Aloha appealed. The ICA affirmed the circuit court. It 
ruled that Aloha lacked standing under HRS § 346-12. HRS § 346-12 only entitles an “applicant or recipient” of services or 
public assistance to appeal DHS decisions. Aloha was neither, 
the ICA said, so the circuit court correctly affirmed the AAO’s 
denial of Aloha’s third-party standing. Aloha “did not show FT 
was unable to protect her own interests.” Instead, the record 
showed that FT had a legal guardian from January 2013 – one 
7  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
month after DHS terminated her Medicaid benefits – until her 
death in June 2014. 
Aloha applied for cert, and we accepted. Aloha maintains 
that it may challenge the lack of notice and seek an 
administrative hearing on DHS’ eligibility determination. 
We hold that Aloha has a constitutionally-protected 
property interest in its reimbursement for Medicaid services 
provided to FT. Due process thus requires notice to Aloha, and the opportunity to be heard at a DHS contested case hearing 
regarding FT’s eligibility. Given Aloha’s reliance on DHS’ 
initial Medicaid eligibility decision, the likely loss of 
$100,000+ in reimbursements and the minimal burden on DHS to 
hold a hearing on FT’s eligibility, a contested case is required 
to satisfy due process. Because Aloha has a protected property 
interest in reimbursement, we also hold that it has standing to 
challenge DHS eligibility decisions that may adversely affect 
those interests. It may request a contested case hearing covering its resident’s eligibility. We remand to the AAO for a 
hearing on the merits.

Id.; State Health Planning and Development Agency, Health Care
Utilization Report 85-87 (2022). In 2022, for example, in some 
facilities up to thirty percent of beds per facility were unusable due to staffing shortages. See Health Care Utilization
Report, supra, at 80-82. So even kūpuna with resources struggle to find placements for long-term care. See id. These long wait 
times strain acute care hospital capacities and negatively impact patients and their families. List, supra. 
The care shortage is worse for patients receiving Medicaid. 
Reportedly, “[p]atients on Medicaid have more difficulty finding 
placements because some facilities are reluctant to take them 
in.” List, supra; see United States General Accounting Office, Admission Problems for Medicaid Recipients and Attempts to Solve 
9  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Them 14 (1990) (“[I]t is generally conceded that Medicaid 
recipients have more trouble getting into nursing homes than 
private payers, there are little data available, either at the 
national or state level, on the extent and severity of access 
problems.”). Medicaid reimbursement rates are lower than what 
private pay residents pay per day. David C. Grabowski & Joseph 
J. Angelelli, The Relationship of Medicaid Payment Rates, Bed 
Constraint Policies, and Risk-Adjusted Pressure Ulcers, 39 Health Servs. Rsch. 793, 795 (2004) (“The Medicaid rate is, on 
average, about 70 percent of the private-pay price.”)
.   Though 
federal law prohibits nursing facilities from asking residents 
to waive their rights to Medicaid and Medicare benefits upon admission, nursing homes may still elect to deny admission to 
people receiving Medicaid benefits in favor of those able to pay 
the higher private rate. See 42 U.S.C § 1396r(c)(5)(A)(i).  
Nursing facilities are essential to Hawaiʻi’s long-term care 
infrastructure and kūpuna population. See
 Scott Suzuki, Long-
Term Care in Hawaii, 19 Haw. B.J. 59, (2015) (other long-term care options include in-home care, senior housing, adult 
residential care homes, assisted living, and community care 
foster homes). These facilities “provide[] skilled nursing and 
related services to residents who require twenty-four hour a day 
medical or nursing care, or rehabilitation services, including but not limited to physical therapy, occupational therapy, and 
10  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
speech therapy services.” Hawaiʻi Administrative Rules (HAR) 
§ 11-94.2-2. And for some who require skilled nursing care, 
nursing homes are where they live out their final years. 
The hardship nursing facilities face when our state’s 
Medicaid program revokes eligibility after a facility has cared for a resident is troubling. 
When the Medicaid beneficiary and 
their authorized representative lack capacity, and when the Office of the Public Guardian (if appointed) chooses not to 
appeal, private facilities don’t get paid. Based on the 
government’s representation that the person was initially 
Medicaid eligible, the facility admitted a new patient. 
Now 
they’re left holding the bag, trying to recover from family 
members or the government. Or even, as a last resort, 
discharging a vulnerable resident. Long-term and end-of-life 
care facilities are valued, necessary fixtures in Hawaiʻ i’s 
support system for kūpuna. 
It is also unsettling that when Medicaid cuts a nursing 
facility resident’s benefits, and no one is willing or able to appeal, those actions go unreviewed. See 
Alakaʻi Na Keiki, Inc. 
v. Matayoshi, 127 Hawaiʻ i 263, 275, 277 P.3d 988, 1000 (2012) 
(statutory delegation of judicial power that precludes judicial 
review of the agency’s decision may raise separation of powers 
issues); AlohaCare v. Dep’t of Hum. Servs., 127 Hawaiʻ i 76, 86, 
276 P.3d 645, 655 (2012) (“[S]eparation of powers concerns may 
11  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
arise when the legislature vests administrative agencies with 
judicial power but precludes judicial review of the agency’s 
decisions. . . . Absent judicial review, the agency is left to 
decide the legality of its own actions, meaning that there is no 
‘check’ on the propriety of the agency’s actions under the 
law.”). 
We hold that nursing facilities like Aloha have a 
constitutionally-protected property interest in reimbursement for Medicaid-related services. Where an individual receiving 
Medicaid benefits does not have an authorized representative 
willing or able to appeal an adverse agency decision, a skilled 
nursing facility providing care to the person must receive 
notice, and the opportunity to appeal a DHS Medicaid eligibility 
determination. 
We begin with the general framework for DHS Medicaid 
appeals. A. The Medicaid appeals process 
First, HRS Chapter 346. 
HRS § 346-12 provides for administrative appeals of adverse 
Medicaid decisions. “An applicant or recipient, deeming oneself aggrieved, shall be entitled to appeal to the [DHS] director in 
the manner prescribed by department rules.” HRS § 346-12. The 
statute provides that an applicant or recipient “shall be 
afforded reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing at 
12  
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
which all of the evidence presented by the parties, to the 
extent allowed by chapter 91, shall be considered in a fair and 
impartial manner.” Id.
Per HRS § 346-1 (2015), “applicant” means “the person for 
whose use and benefit application for services or public 
assistance is made.” “Recipient” means “the person for whose 
use and benefit services are rendered or a grant of public 
assistance is made.” Id.“Applicant” and “recipient” thus mean 
the person receiving Medicaid benefits. See id.
HRS § 346-12 incorporates DHS rules by reference. Those 
rules allow an “authorized representative” to advocate for a 
beneficiary in an administrative proceeding. HAR § 17-1703.1-
3(d)(3). The representative must be authorized to act on behalf 
of the individual. HAR § 17-1703.1-3(c) (“[An individual’s] 
written authorization shall be received by the department before 
the department acknowledges any action taken by the authorized 
representative on the individual’s behalf.”). 
This regulation is consistent with federal Medicaid 
requirements. Per 42 CFR § 435.923, state agencies tasked with administering Medicaid must allow beneficiaries to designate 
authorized representatives: 
(a)(1) The agency must permit applicants and beneficiaries 
to designate an individual or organization to act 
responsibly on their behalf in assisting with the 
individual’ s application and renewal of eligibility and 
other ongoing communications with the agency. Such a 
designation must be in accordance with paragraph (f) of 
13  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
this section, including the applicant’ s signature, and must 
be permitted at the time of application and at other times. 
(2) Authority for an individual or entity to act on 
behalf of an applicant or beneficiary accorded under 
state law, including but not limited to, a court order establishing legal guardianship or a power of 
attorney, must be treated as a written designation by 
the applicant or beneficiary of authorized 
representation. 
42 CFR § 435.923. 
Individuals or entities who are not the applicant or 
beneficiary, or who are not the authorized representative, 
according to the rule, may not challenge eligibility determinations. HAR § 17-1703.1-3(d)(3). 
This rule still applies to most Medicaid appeals. We hold, 
however, that under certain circumstances, skilled nursing 
facilities have standing to appeal adverse DHS Medicaid 
eligibility determinations affecting facility residents admitted 
with Medicaid benefits. B. Skilled nursing facilities have constitutionally-protected 
property interests in reimbursement for Medicaid services 
Skilled nursing facilities have constitutionally-protected 
due process rights to notice when a facility resident’s Medicaid 
benefits are adversely impacted by an ineligibility 
determination. They also have the right to an administrative 
hearing challenging the ineligibility determination. 
Article I, section 5 of the Hawaiʻi Constitution provides 
that “[n]o person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law.” Haw. Const. art. I, § 5. “We have 
14  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
long recognized that ‘[c]onstitutional due process protections 
mandate a hearing whenever the claimant seeks to protect a 
“property interest,” in other words, a benefit to which the 
claimant is legitimately entitled.’” In re Application of Maui
Elec. Co., Ltd. (MECO), 141 Hawaiʻ i 249, 260, 408 P.3d 1, 12 
(2017). 
Procedural due process requires notice and an opportunity 
to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner 
before governmental deprivation of a significant property 
interest. Sandy Beach Def. Fund v. City Council of City & Cnty.
of Honolulu, 70 Haw. 361, 378, 773 P.2d 250, 261 (1989) (citing Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 333 (1976)). 
Protected property interests implicate the Hawaiʻ i 
Constitution’s due process clause, but are not themselves a 
product of that clause. See MECO, 141 Hawaiʻ i at 260, 408 P.3d 
at 12. 
“The legitimate claims of entitlement that constitute 
property interests are not created by the due process clause 
itself.” Id.Instead, “they are created and their dimensions 
are defined by existing rules or understanding that stem from an 
independent source such as state law — rules or understanding 
that secure certain benefits and that support claims of 
entitlement to those benefits.” Id. (quoting In re ʻ Īao Ground 
Water Mgmt. Area High-Level Source Water Use Permit Applications (ʻĪao), 128 Hawai ʻi 228, 241, 287 P.3d 129, 142 (2012)). 
15  
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
A party must demonstrate a true entitlement to establish a 
property interest. This court explained that “a party has a 
property interest in the subject of litigation for purposes of 
due process analysis if the party has ‘more than an abstract 
need or desire for it. [They] must have more than a unilateral 
expectation of it. [They] must, instead, have a claim of 
entitlement to it.’” ʻIao, 128 Hawaiʻ i at 241, 287 P.3d at 142 
(quoting Sandy Beach Def. Fund, 70 Haw. at 376, 773 P.2d at 260; Pele Def. Fund v. Puna Geothermal Venture, 77 Hawaiʻ i 64, 68, 881 
P.2d 1210, 1214 (1994) ( 
“Constitutional due process protections 
mandate a hearing whenever the claimant seeks to protect a 
‘property interest,’ in other words, a benefit to which the 
claimant is legitimately entitled.”). 
Nursing facilities’ protected property interest in payment 
for services performed for facility residents arises from DHS 
rules. SeeʻĪao,
 128 Hawaiʻi at 241, 287 P.3d at 142.  According 
to DHS administrative rules, nursing facilities are entitled to 
reimbursement for services provided to Medicaid residents. Nursing facilities accredited for short-term rehabilitation and 
long-term nursing care are reimbursed by the Medicaid long term 
care prospective payment system via facility-specific 
prospective per diem rates: 
(b) Except as noted herein, the Medicaid program shall pay 
for institutional long- term care services through the use 
of a facility- specific prospective per diem rate.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
HAR § 17-1739.2-3(b); see 42 CFR § 447.252(b) (“The [state] plan 
must specify comprehensively the methods and standards used by 
the agency to set payment rates in a manner consistent with [42 
CFR § 430.10 state plan written requirements].”). Federal law also requires state plans to provide for provider reimbursement 
according to rates that the state “finds, and makes assurances 
satisfactory to the [federal Department of Human Services] 
Secretary,” are “reasonable and adequate to meet the costs which 
must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated 
facilities . . . .” 42 CFR § 447.250. 
Medicaid payments for services performed are rule-based 
entitlements based on agreements with DHS. To establish 
Medicaid reimbursement eligibility, providers such as nursing facilities must complete Enrollment Form 1139. According to the 
Provider Enrollment Form Nursing Facility Attachment, DHS must 
reimburse nursing facilities for authorized Medicaid services: 
DHS shall reimburse the FACILITY for authorized 
[Nursing Facility (NF)] services provided to residents. 
Reimbursements shall be limited to services rendered in the areas of the FACILITY, which are licensed by the State 
Department of Health as a NF under 42 C.F.R. Part 483.

Keahole Defense Coalition held that certain government 
“benefits” do not constitute “statutory entitlement” conferring 
a legitimate property interest. Keahole Def. Coal., Inc. v. Bd.
of Land & Nat. Res.
, 110 Hawaiʻi 419, 433, 134 P.3d 585, 599 
(2006). A telecommunications provider did not have a “statutory 
entitlement” to an exclusive license issued by the Department of 
Hawaiian Home Lands because the agency has discretion to grant 
licenses and determine the terms of any leases granted. Id.
 at 
433-34, 134 P.3d at 599-600. Where the government has discretion – such as deciding whether to grant or deny state 
operating licenses – the lack of entitlement bars property 
interest-based claims. See id. (citing Thornton v. City of St.
Helens, 425 F.3d 1158, 1164 (9th Cir. 2005). 
DHS does not have discretion as to whether it may reimburse 
facilities for services performed. If a resident is eligible 
for Medicaid, then DHS must reimburse the facility when it 
provides care for a nursing home resident. See HAR § 17-1739.2-
3(b); 42 CFR § 47.252. That is not to say that Medicaid is required to pay for unauthorized services. See HAR § 17-1739.2-
3(b). Because the requirement that Medicaid “pay for 
institutional long-term care services through the use of a 
facility-specific prospective per diem rate” is not 
discretionary, it constitutes an entitlement giving rise to a 
protected property interest. See id.
18  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Thus, by rule – and by DHS’ agreement with licensed nursing 
facilities - skilled nursing facilities are entitled to payment 
for Medicaid services performed for eligible beneficiaries. See
ʻĪao, 128 Hawaiʻ i at 241, 287 P.3d at 142; HAR § 17-1739.2-3(b). 
Other jurisdictions support our conclusion.   In Oberlander 
v. Perales, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals held that a skilled nursing facility licensed as a Medicaid provider, under 
New York law, had a “property interest in money paid for 
services already performed in reliance on a duly promulgated 
reimbursement rate.” 740 F.2d 116, 120 (2d Cir. 1984). Thus, 
the provider had federal due process rights. Id. Pressley
Ridge Schools, Inc. v. Stottlemyer also held that a behavioral health care provider’s “interest in receiving reimbursement for 
services to Medicaid recipients is a protectable property 
interest under the Fourteenth Amendment.” 947 F.Supp. 929, 940 
(S.D. W. Va. 1996). 
Federal courts have also held that a provider’s property 
interest begins when the notice of eligibility is issued. In 
Anchorage SNF, LLC v. Padilla, the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland held that the nursing facilities’ property 
interest in payment for services provided began when an 
applicant or nursing home resident “receives a Notice of 
Eligibility”: 
19  
 
 
  
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
[Other federal cases] determined the medical 
providers had a property interest in payments for services 
previously rendered. For the purposes of the Motion, the 
court is satisfied that once an applicant/resident receives 
a Notice of Eligibility, Plaintiffs’ property interest in 
payment for services rendered is born. The Notice of 
Eligibility signals to the applicant and Plaintiffs that 
the applicant is eligible for the services offered by 
Plaintiffs, and Plaintiffs will be paid for those services 
once rendered. Accordingly, the court finds, that 
Plaintiffs have a property interest in payments for 
services rendered to eligible residents. 
Anchorage SNF, No. 1:22-cv-00166-JRR, 2023 WL 1107994, at 
*8 (D. Md. Jan. 30, 2023) (mem. op.) (emphases added). 
We reach a similar conclusion. By law, Medicaid recipients 
have no money to pay for humane care. 20 CFR § 416.1205 (the 
resource limit for Medicaid recipients is $2,000). A notice of 
eligibility signals the government’s endorsement that residents 
are covered by Medicaid upon admission. While eligibility may 
change, facilities rely on these initial determinations. 
In Hawaiʻ i, a long-term care provider’s reimbursement rate 
is set by Med-Quest. See HAR § 17-1739.2-3. Providers are 
reimbursed “based on the number of days of care that the 
provider delivers to the resident, the acuity level that is 
medically necessary for each day of care, and the provider’s 
[prospective payment system] rate.” See HAR § 17-1739.2-3(a); 
HAR § 17-1700.1-2 (“‘Acuity level or level of medical care’ means one of the following types of inpatient services: [nursing 
facility] or [intermediate care facility for individuals with 
intellectual disabilities].”). The prospective payment system 
20  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
rate (the amount the facility is paid daily for caring for a 
Medicaid beneficiary) is facility-specific and based in part on 
historic cost. See HAR § 17-1739.2-3; HAR § 17-1700.1-2 (“‘PPS 
rate’ means the prospective payment system annual rate assigned each Medicaid institutional provider.”). Aloha’s daily rate as 
of January 2025, for example, was $528.49. See Letter from Judy 
Mohr Peterson, PhD to QUEST Integration Health Plans, Medicaid Fee-for-Service Rates for All Nursing and Hospice Facilities Effective January 1, 2025 Thru June 30, 2025 (Dec. 12, 2024) 
(available at: 
https://medquest.hawaii.gov/content/dam/formsanddocuments/provid 
er-memos/qi-memos/qi-memos-2024/QI_2427.PDF) 
[https://perma.cc/D8XT-JESZ]. 
When residents with Medicaid coverage are admitted, 
facilities like Aloha rely on the accuracy of DHS’ Medicaid 
eligibility determination. They anticipate payments for those 
services according to state-established daily rates. HAR § 17-1739.2-3(b). 
We hold that skilled nursing services provided in reliance 
on the Medicaid rate for Medicaid residents constitute a 
protected property interest. 
A facility resident losing eligibility mid-stay does not 
sever this entitlement. See Aguiar v. Hawaii Housing Auth., 55 
Haw. 478, 493-94, 496, 522 P.2d 1255, 1265-67 (1974) (plaintiffs 
21  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
whose leases were terminated for allegedly exceeding income 
limits had property interests in low-income housing benefits 
sufficient to require a pre-termination hearing). For sure, 
Medicaid will only reimburse providers for services provided to 
an eligible beneficiary. But continued services – based on a 
resident’s Medicaid eligibility upon admission – does not change 
the status of a protected property interest in reimbursement. 
See id.
Here, the Medicaid compensation framework supports a 
nursing facility’s property interest in reimbursement for 
provided services under Hawaiʻi law.  
See id.; HAR § 17-1739.2-
3(b). 
First, DHS regulations detail the daily rate providers are 
paid for providing Medicaid services to residents. HAR § 17-
1739.2-3(b). 
Second, Medicaid is a “vendor only” plan, where “payment 
ordinarily cannot be made to the recipient of medical assistance 
but can only be made to the vendor or provider of the services.” 
81 C.J.S. Social Security and Public Welfare § 267 (2024); 42 CFR § 447.10(d) (“Payment may be made only . . . [t]o the 
provider; or . . . [t]o [certain beneficiaries receiving the 
payment for physicians’ or dentists’ services per 42 CFR 
§ 447.25.]”); see HAR § 17-1739.2-3 (requiring DHS to reimburse 
long-term care providers for services delivered). In other 
22  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
words, beneficiaries living at nursing facilities never see 
these payments – DHS directly pays the medical provider. Thus, 
this regulatory framework supports our holding that nursing 
facilities who have accepted Medicaid-eligible residents hold a 
property interest in Medicaid reimbursement for their services. 
Nursing facilities are unique medical providers. They care 
for individuals requiring high levels of care, where community 
or home care is not possible. See HAR § 11-94.2-2 (nursing 
facilities provide twenty-four-hour care for residents who 
require medical and nursing care, or rehabilitation). And they 
often care for elderly patients during their final years. 
Because skilled nursing facilities offer twenty-four hour 
services, they are involved in nearly all aspects of a 
resident’s care – housing, medical and behavioral care, activity 
programming, family visitation and relations, and more. While 
the constitutionally-protected property interest in Medicaid 
reimbursement belongs solely to the nursing facility, its role in the client’s care uniquely positions facilities to appeal an 
adverse decision where family, authorized representatives, or 
public guardians are unable or unwilling to assist. 
Here, for example, while FT’s authorized representative 
(her husband) lacked capacity to appeal on her behalf, the 
record does not explain why FT’s public guardian did not step in 
to appeal the eligibility denial. But under these 
23  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
circumstances, to conclude that no other party has a right to 
appeal, blocks meaningful judicial review of DHS decisions. See
AlohaCare, 127 Hawaiʻ i at 86, 276 P.3d at 655 (“Absent judicial 
review, the agency is left to decide the legality of its own 
actions, meaning that there is no ‘check’ on the propriety of 
the agency’s actions under the law.”). 
We hold that skilled nursing facilities have a protected 
property interest in Medicaid payment for services performed in 
reliance on Department of Human Services eligibility 
determinations, and thus, have due process rights under article 
I, section 5 of the Hawaiʻ i Constitution.  See Haw. Const. art. 
I, § 5; MECO, 141 Hawaiʻ i at 260, 408 P.3d at 12. 
Aloha had a protected property interest in payment for 
services provided to FT in reliance on DHS’ initial eligibility 
determination. Thus, it was entitled to procedural due process: 
notice and the opportunity to be heard. 
C. Nursing facilities have due process rights to notice and 
the opportunity to be heard 
1. Notice 
First, we hold that skilled nursing facilities are entitled 
to notice of adverse actions related to their residents’ Medicaid eligibility. 
Per the Department of Human Services Med-Quest Division’s 
Administrative rules, it must provide notice of benefits 
24  
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
eligibility decisions to “individuals”: 
Notice of eligibility, or level of benefits and 
services. (a) The department shall provide an individual 
with a written notice of any decision by the department or 
designee affecting the individual’s eligibility for 
benefits and services approval, denial, termination, or 
suspension of benefits or services. 
HAR § 17-1713.1-2(a) (emphasis added). 
This administrative rule is consistent with federal law 
governing Medicaid. 42 CFR § 435.917 (“Consistent with 
§§ 431.206 through 431.214 of this chapter, the agency must provide all applicants and beneficiaries with timely and 
adequate written notice of any decision affecting their 
eligibility, including an approval, denial, termination or 
suspension of eligibility, or a denial or change in benefits and 
services.”). 
But now that skilled nursing facilities have constitutional 
protection, what notice is DHS required to provide? 
Under Hawaiʻ i law, the government’s due process obligations 
are case specific. Mauna Kea Anaina Hou v. Bd. of Land & Nat.
Res., 136 Hawaiʻ i 376, 389, 363 P.3d 224, 237 (2015). Due 
process “calls for such procedural protections as the particular 
situation demands.” Id. (quoting Sandy Beach Def. Fund, 70 Haw. 
at 378, 773 P.2d at 261). “[B]ut its basic elements are notice 
and an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a 
meaningful manner.” Davis v. Bissen, 154 Hawaiʻ i 68, 82, 545 
P.3d 557, 571 (2024). 
25  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
First, we discuss the notice requirement. Adequate notice 
informs parties of the adverse action and informs them of the 
“procedures available for challenging that action.” Id.Under 
these circumstances, due process requires notice to skilled nursing facilities of any adverse eligibility determination, and 
information regarding the facility’s appeal rights. See HAR 
§ 17-1713.1-2; § 17-1703.1-4 (appeals of eligibility related decisions must be received by DHS within ninety calendar days of the date of the notice). We hold that DHS must issue notice to 
skilled nursing facilities caring for residents when it issues 
adverse decisions related to a resident’s Medicaid eligibility, 
including termination and suspension of benefits. 
DHS is authorized to disclose otherwise confidential 
information to “Medicaid providers who require eligibility, cost 
share or [third-party liability] information for billing or 
recovery purposes.” HAR § 17-1702-5(b)(3)(C); see HRS § 346-
10(c) (2015) (“The department shall promulgate and enforce such rules as may be necessary to prevent improper acquisition or use 
of confidential information.”); 42 CFR § 431.306(a) (“The agency 
must have criteria specifying the conditions for release and use 
of information about applicants and beneficiaries.”). 
Confidential information includes, among other things, a 
patient’s social and economic circumstances, DHS’ “evaluation of 
recorded or unrecorded information about a particular 
26  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
individual, whether or not an applicant or recipient,” and 
“[c]orrespondence concerning a particular individual.” HAR 
§ 17-1702-4(a). Thus, DHS may disclose eligibility 
determinations to nursing facility providers. See HAR § 17-
1702-5(b)(3)(C). While the rule may not have previously required eligibility disclosure, due process requires disclosure 
to skilled nursing facilities to provide notice of benefits 
termination. 
Providing notice of resident Medicaid ineligibility is 
hardly an administrative burden for DHS. Medicaid payments are already assigned to the facility providing nursing care services 
to the beneficiary. The State also begins paying the daily rate 
for Medicaid residents upon their admission. See HAR § 17-
1739.2-3(b). Thus, the information DHS needs to notify a resident’s nursing facility of suspension or termination of 
Medicaid eligibility is easily accessible. And because this 
holding only impacts applicants and beneficiaries already receiving skilled nursing facility level care, it only affects a 
narrow category of Medicaid beneficiaries. 
Here, neither party disputes that DHS did not provide 
notice to Aloha when DHS terminated FT’s Medicaid benefits. 
Failure to provide notice thus violated Aloha’s due process 
right to notice. 
27  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
We note that Aloha appealed FT’s eligibility determination 
nearly two years after DHS cut FT’s benefits. Because DHS did 
not notify Aloha of its adverse decision, though, we hold that 
the appeal was not untimely. This does not alter the 
requirement that facilities that receive notice of an adverse 
decision based on this case’s holding timely appeal the 
decision. 
2. Opportunity to be heard 
Skilled nursing facilities have due process rights to be 
heard regarding the applicant’s eligibility. That is, if the 
applicant or beneficiary, or an authorized representative is 
otherwise unwilling or unable to appeal an adverse decision. 
This due process right to be heard also means that DHS must hold 
a contested case hearing – a hearing “required by law.” See
MECO
, 141 Hawaiʻi at 258, 408 P.3d at 10. The due process right 
to a contested case hearing also establishes Aloha’s standing to 
request a contested case regarding FT’s eligibility. 
Procedural due process requires that parties with property 
interests have an “opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.” See id.
 at 269, 408 P.3d at 21 
(cleaned up). This includes “the right to submit evidence and argument on the issues” involving the asserted property 
interest. Id.
28  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Because nursing facilities have due process rights based on 
constitutionally-protected property interests, AAO 
administrative hearings are “required by law.” Id. at 258, 408 
P.3d at 10 (“In order for an administrative agency hearing to be ‘required by law, it may be required by (1) agency rule, (2) 
statute, or (3) constitutional due process.’”) (quoting 
Kaleikini v. Thielen, 124 Hawaiʻ i 1, 16–17, 237 P.3d 1067, 1082– 
83 (2010)). Therefore, those administrative hearings are considered contested case hearings. 
The Hawaiʻ i Administrative 
Procedures Act (HAPA) governs these proceedings. See HRS 
chapter 91; Bush v. Hawaiian Homes Comm’n
, 76 Hawaiʻ i 128, 135, 
870 P.2d 1272, 1279 (1994) (“The adjudicatory procedures of the 
Hawaii Administrative Procedure Act apply to hearings which an 
agency is constitutionally required to provide.”) (quoting 
Aguiar, 55 Haw. at 478, 522 P.2d at 1256) (cleaned up). 
When determining the specific procedures required to comply 
with constitutional due process, we consider and balance three 
factors: “(1) the private interest which will be affected; (2) the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through 
the procedures actually used, and the probable value, if any, of 
additional or alternative procedural safeguards; and (3) the 
governmental interest, including the burden that additional 
procedural safeguards would entail.” Flores v. Bd. of Land &
Nat. Res.
, 143 Hawaiʻi 114, 126-27, 424 P.3d 469, 481-82 (2018) 
29  
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(quoting Sandy Beach Def. Fund, 70 Haw. at 378, 773 P.2d at 
261). 
Regarding the first factor, the private interest affected 
is Aloha’s $121,831.99 in unpaid Medicaid reimbursements for 
FT’s end-of-life care. Because payment for past Medicaid 
services is a constitutionally-protected property interest, we 
consider that interest significant. For the second factor, the 
risk of erroneous deprivation absent a contested case hearing is high for Aloha because no other party is willing or able to 
appeal the adverse determination on FT’s behalf. Because DHS is 
required to provide administrative appeals of adverse Medicaid 
decisions by statute for the “applicant” or “recipient,” DHS is 
not unduly burdened by affording Aloha a contested case hearing. 
See MECO
, 141 Hawaiʻi at 266, 408 P.3d at 18. As DHS pointed 
out, it also would have granted a contested case hearing to FT’s 
authorized representative or public guardian. Thus, when no one 
else is willing or able to appeal, DHS’ burden to hold a 
contested case hearing is slight. See id.
We hold that under the circumstances of this case, the 
protected interest in reimbursement for Medicaid services performed mandates a DHS hearing to consider FT’s Medicaid 
eligibility. See id.
 at 269, 408 P.3d at 21. Requiring a 
contested case hearing directed at FT’s eligibility is 
30  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
reasonable due to the high probability that Medicaid will not 
reimburse Aloha for its services. See id.
We hold that Aloha has a due process right to a contested 
case hearing covering FT’s eligibility determination. 
Because Aloha has a right to a contested case hearing, we 
also hold that Aloha has standing to request a contested case 
hearing regarding beneficiary eligibility. SeeʻĪao, 128 Hawaiʻ i 
at 241, 287 P.3d at 142. 
This court has held that “standing is a prudential concern 
and not an issue of subject matter jurisdiction[.]” Tax Found.
of Hawaiʻ i v. State, 144 Hawaiʻ i 175, 190, 439 P.3d 127, 142 
(2019). 
Standing is thus “solely an issue of justiciability, 
arising out of prudential concerns of judicial self-governance.” 
Id. This court’s “basic position has been that standing 
requirements should not be barriers to justice.” Life of the
Land v. Land Use Comm’n, 63 Haw. 166, 174, 623 P.2d 431, 439 (1981). 
When a “person” is entitled to a contested case hearing, 
they have standing to request a contested case hearing. See
Mauna Kea Anaina Hou
, 136 Hawaiʻi at 390, 363 P.3d at 238; HRS 
§ 91-1 (Supp. 2017) (“‘Persons’ includes individuals, 
partnerships, corporations, associations, agencies, or public or 
private organizations.”). Our holding that Aloha has the due 
process right to a contested case hearing based on a property 
31  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
interest inherently recognizes that Aloha suffered an actual 
injury to its constitutional due process rights traceable to 
DHS’ actions, and that DHS holding a hearing on FT’s eligibility 
would provide relief for that injury. See MECO, 141 Hawaiʻ i at 
270, 408 P.3d at 22. 
Because DHS is required to hold a 
contested case hearing regarding FT’s eligibility, Aloha has 
standing to appeal the DHS’ eligibility determination. See id.
Thus, Aloha has standing to request a contested case 
hearing concerning FT’s Medicaid eligibility termination. 
D. Pipeline retroactive application 
When this court announces a new rule, it may consider 
prospective versus retrospective application. See League of
Women Voters of Honolulu v. State , 150 Hawaiʻi 182, 207, 499 P.3d 
382, 407 (2021). This court has identified four degrees of 
retroactive effect: (1) purely prospective effect (“applied 
neither to the parties in the law-making decision nor to those 
others against or by whom it might be applied to conduct or 
events occurring before that decision”); (2) limited or 
“pipeline” retroactive effect (“the rule applies to the parties 
in the decision and all cases that are on direct review or not 
yet final as of the date of the decision”); (3) full retroactive 
effect (“the rule applies both to the parties before the court 
and to all others by and against whom claims may be pressed”); and (4) selective retroactive effect (“the court applies the new 
32  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
rule ‘in the case in which it is pronounced, then return[s] to 
the old [rule] with respect to all [other cases] arising on 
facts predating the pronouncement’”). Id. at 207 n.39, 499 P.3d 
at 407 n.39. When deciding whether to give a new rule 
retroactive effect, this court “weigh[s] the merits and demerits 
of retroactive application of the particular rule, in light of 
(a) the purpose of the newly announced rule, (b) the extent of 
reliance . . . on the old standards, and (c) the effect on the administration of justice of a retroactive application of the 
new standards[.]” Id. at 207, 499 P.3d at 407. 
We hold that limited or “pipeline” retroactive effect is 
most appropriate under the circumstances. 
Our holding 
establishes important constitutional due process rights for nursing facilities seeking to challenge a resident’s Medicaid 
eligibility. Despite the agency’s procedural reliance on HRS 
§ 346-12, HAR § 17-1703.1-3(d)(3), and HAR § 17-1713.1-2, we do 
not consider it a significant burden for DHS to hold a hearing for similarly situated skilled nursing facilities with cases on 
direct review. The eligibility determination is fairly narrow, 
and may not require significant fact finding by the agency in 
instances where no other party aside from the nursing home is 
willing or able to appeal an adverse DHS decision. Further, 
because our holding involves situations where no other party is 
available to appeal DHS’ eligibility decision, we are concerned 
33  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
that for nursing facilities’ cases in the “pipeline,” agency 
decisions will go unreviewed should our holding not apply. 
Thus, our new rule is prospective in effect, but applies to the 
parties in the decision and all cases that are on direct review 
or not yet final on the date of the judgment. 
III. 
We vacate both the ICA’s judgment, and the Circuit Court of 
the First Circuit’s August 1, 2018 “Order Affirming 
Administrative Hearing Decision Dated November 20, 2017” and 
August 1, 2018 Judgment. We remand for a new administrative 
hearing on the merits of FT’s Medicaid eligibility between 
November 2012 and FT’s death. Thomas E. Bush  /s/ Mark E. Recktenwald
