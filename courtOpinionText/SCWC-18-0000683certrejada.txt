CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
(CAAP-18-0000683; CIVIL NO. 14-1-429K) 
ORDER  REJECTING  APPLICATION  FOR  WRIT  OF  CERTIORARI  AND 
DENYING  PETITION  FOR  WRIT  OF  MANDAMUS  AND  OTHER  APPROPRIATE  RELIEF 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of the “Petition for a Writ of 
Certiorari and Writ of Mandamus and Any Other Appropriate Relief 
the Court Deems Appropriate,” filed on April 1, 2019, which was submitted by Michael Miroyan, individually and as the sole owner of Hawaiian Riverbend, LLC, the documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the record, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that as to the request for 
certiorari review, the application for a writ of certiorari is rejected. See HRS § 602-59(b). IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that as to the request for 
mandamus or other appropriate relief, the request is denied. See 
Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai# i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 
(1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action; where a court has discretion to act, mandamus will not lie to interfere with or control the exercise of that discretion, even when the judge has acted erroneously, unless the judge has exceeded his or her jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion, or has refused to act on a subject properly before the court under circumstances in which he or she has a legal duty to act).
