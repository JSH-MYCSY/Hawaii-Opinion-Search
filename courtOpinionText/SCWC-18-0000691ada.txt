 give a “ Sheffield  instruction” to a jury in a kidnapping trial.  
In this case, the defendant was charged with kidnapping under 
Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (“HRS”) § 707-720(d)(1) (2014), which 
provides, “A person commits the offense of kidnappi ng if the 
person intentionally or knowingly restrains another person with 
intent to . . . [i]nflict bodily injury upon that person or 
subject that person to a sexual offense . . . .”  Sheffield  held 
that a jury must be instructed that the “restraint” necessary  
under HRS § 707-720(d)(1) is “restraint in excess of any 
restraint incidental to the infliction or intended infliction of 
bodily injury or subjection or intended subjection of a person 
to a sexual offense . . . .”  State v. S heffield , 146 Hawaiʻi 49, 
51, 456 P.3d 122, 124 (2020).   
We hold that the circuit court err ed in failing to so 
instruct the jury, and such error was not harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt.  T herefore, we vacate the ICA’ s April 15, 2020 
Judgment on Appeal, entered pursuant to its February 27, 2020 
 
considered supplemental briefing pursuant to Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate 
Procedure Rule 28(b)(4)(D)  (2022), which provides in relevant part:  
  
[T]he appellate court, at its option, may notice a plain 
error not presented.  If an appellate court, when acting on 
a case on appeal, contemplates basing the disposition of 
the case wholly or in part upon an issue of plain error not 
raised by the parties through briefing, it shall not 
affirm, reverse, or vacate t he case without allowing the 
parties the opportunity to brief the potential plain -error 
issue prior to disposition.  . . .

 Summary Disposition Order  (“SDO”), and remand this case to the 
circuit court for further proceedings.   
II.  Background  
A.  Jury trial Proceedings  
 On August 18, 2016, the State charged Lorrin Y. Ishimine 
(“Ishimine”) with one count of Kidnapping, in violation of HRS § 
707-720(d)(1) (Count One); two counts of Felony Abuse of Family 
or Household Member, in violation of HRS § 709 -906(1) and/or (8)  
(2014 & Supp. 2015 & 2016)  (Counts Two and Three); and one count 
of Abuse of Family or Household Member, in violation of HRS § 
709-906 (2014 & Supp. 2015 & 2016)  (Count Four).   Before trial, 
the circuit court dismissed Counts Two, Three, and Four without 
prejudice.    
 At Ishimine’s jury trial on the remaining kidnapping count 
(Count One), the State called Maui Police Department (“MPD”) 
Officers Victor Santana and Keola Wilhelm.    
 Officer Santana testified that he was asleep at home on the 
afternoon of August 17, 2016, when he heard a vehicle speeding 
down the street.   He looked out his window and saw the vehicle 
pull into a driveway at a two -story house across from his 
apartment.   Officer Santana saw a man exit the car, yelling and 
screaming and trying to get someone out of the vehicle.   Officer 
Santana got dressed, and when he returned to the window, he saw 
the man grabbing a woman from behind and dragging her up the ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
4 
 stairs of the two -story house.   The woman was screaming for 
help, kicking her feet , and struggling to get away.   The woman’s 
screaming and struggling lasted for a minute, which was the 
entire time the man dragged her up the stairs.   Officer Santana 
then called 911, watched the house for anyone entering or 
leaving, and awaited the arrival of responding officers.   
 Officer Keola Wilhelm testified that he was one of the 
responding officers and was briefed at the scene by Officer 
Santana.   The responding officers approached the front door of 
the two-story home and spoke with a woman who initiall y stated 
that no one else was home.   The woman eventually allowed the 
police officers inside the residence and directed them to a 
locked bedroom door.   After knocking and announcing their 
presence three times, the police officers knocked down the 
bedroom d oor.  Officer Wilhelm saw the defendant on the bed, 
holding a woman down and covering her mouth.   Officer Wilhelm 
ordered the defendant to release the woman and exit the bedroom, 
and the defendant complied.      
 After the State rested, the defense rested a s well, with 
Ishimine waiving his right to testify.   The court then 
instructed the jury as follows on the offense of  kidnapping:  
The Defendant, LORRIN Y. ISHIMINE, is charged with 
the offense of Kidnapping.  
 
A person commits the offense of Kidnapping if he 
intentionally or knowingly restrains another person with ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
5 
   intent to inflict bodily injury upon that person or subject 
that person to a sexual offense.  
 
There are three material elements of the offense of 
Kidnapping, each of which the prosecution must prove beyond 
a reasonable doubt.   These three elements are:  
 
1. That, on or about the 17th day of August, 2016, in 
the County of Maui, State of Hawai ʻi, the Defendant 
restrained another person; and  
 
2. That the  Defendant did so intentionally or 
knowingly; and  
 
3. That the Defendant did so with the intent to 
inflict bodily injury upon that person or subject that 
person to a sexual offense.  
 
The circuit court gave the jury the following instruction on the 
definition of “restrain”:  “to restrict a person’s movement in 
such a manner as to interfere substantially with her liberty by 
means of force.”3      
 The jury found Ishimine guilty as charged of kidnapping .  
The jury also found that the State proved beyond a re asonable 
doubt that Ishimine did not voluntarily release the woman prior 
to trial.   As a result of this finding, Ishimine was convicted 
 
3  This definition of “restrain” was adapted from Hawaiʻi Pattern Jury 
Instructions – Criminal 9 .00 to reflect the evidence adduced at trial.  The 
pattern jury instruction reads as follows:  
 
“Restrain” means to restrict a person’s movement in such a 
manner as to interfere substantially with the person’s 
liberty:  
(1) by means of force, threat, or dece ption; or  
(2) if the person is under the age of eighteen or 
incompetent, without the consent of the relative, person, 
or institution having lawful custody of the person.  
 
The modified  “restraint” instruction was given by agreement of the parties.   
The circuit court did not give the jury the Sheffield  instruction because we 
had not decided Sheffield  at the time of Ishimine’s trial.  ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
6 
 of kidnapping as a class A felony.  See HRS § 707-720(2)&(3) 
(2014) (stating that “kidnapping is a class A felony” that can 
be reduced to a class B felony where “the defendant voluntarily 
released the victim, alive and not suffering from serious or 
substantial bodily injury, in a safe place prior to trial,” 
respectively).  Ishimine was sentenced to twenty years of 
imprisonm ent.  
B.  ICA Proceedings  
 Ishimine appealed his conviction and sentence.   The State 
cross-appealed.4  Before the ICA, Ishimine’s  points of error were 
(1) that the circuit court erred in denying his motion to 
suppress evidence based on the warrantless entry of his home and 
bedroom; (2) that the circuit court erred in denying Ishimine’s 
motion in limine to preclude hearsay statements  made by the 
woman who answered the door of the residence and told police 
that Ishimine was not there; and (3) Ishimine’s conviction was 
not supported by substantial evidence.       
 In an SDO, the ICA rejected each of Ishimine’s arguments.  
State v. Ishimine , CAAP-18-0000691 (App. 2020) (SDO) at 19.  
 
4  Upon cross -appeal, the State argued that the circu it court erred by  
(1) suppressing photographs of the inside of Ishimine’s residence; (2) 
refusing to receive the complaining witness’s preliminary hearing transcript 
into evidence; (3) precluding officer testimony of, and photographic evidence 
of, the com plaining witness’s physical condition; and (4) striking a portion 
of Ishimine’s Presentence Investigation Report (“PSR”) and ordering the 
Hawaiʻi Paroling Authority (“HPA”) to disregard that information in sentencing 
Ishimine to a minimum term of imprisonm ent.  ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
7 
 Addressing Ishimine’s points of error, the ICA held that (1) 
exigent circumstances supported the warrantless entry into 
Ishimine’s home and bedroom; (2) the circuit court did not abuse 
its discre tion in allowing testimony that the woman who answered 
the door told police that Ishimine and the complaining witness 
were not in the home, as the statement was not admitted for the 
truth of the matter asserted but to show that the woman was 
willing to cov er up Ishimine’s presence; and (3) that 
substantial circumstantial evidence of Ishimine’s state of mind 
supported his kidnapping conviction.  Ishimine , SDO at 9, 13, 
15.  Therefore, the ICA affirmed Ishimine’s conviction.5  
Ishimine , SDO at 15.   
C.  Cert iorari Application  
 Ishimine  filed an application for writ of certiorari 
raising the same legal issues he raised before the ICA.  We 
accepted certiorari, however, to address whether the circuit 
court plainly erred in failing to give a “ Sheffield  instruction” 
in this case.6   
 
5  As a result of the affirmance, the State’s points of error on cross -
appeal were mooted; however, under the “public interest” exception to the 
mootness doctrine, the ICA addressed the State’s final point of error:  that 
the circuit court erred in st riking a portion of Ishimine’s PSR and ordering 
the HPA to disregard that information in sentencing Ishimine to a minimum 
term of imprisonment.  Ishimine , SDO at 15, 16, 18.  The ICA found the 
argument without merit, as the circuit court had authority to m odify the PSR, 
and the HPA would not have considered stricken material in a PSR.  Ishimine , 
SDO at 18.

III.  Standard of Review :   
Plain Error Review of Jury Instructions  
 
As a general rule, jury instructions to which no objection 
has been made at trial will be reviewed only for plain 
error.  An error will be deemed plain error if the 
substantial rights of the d efendant have been affected 
adversely.  Additionally, this court will apply the plain 
error standard of review to correct errors [that] seriously 
affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of 
judicial proceedings, to serve the ends of justice, an d to 
prevent the denial of fundamental rights.  
 
Sheffield , 146 Hawaiʻi at 53, 456 P.3d at 126 (citation omitted).  
IV.  Discussion  
A.  Order for Supplemental Briefing  
By order dated September 28, 2021, the full court directed 
the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing the following 
questions:   
(1) whether the trial court plainly erred when it did not 
instruct the jurors that any “restraint of [the victim] had 
to be restraint in excess of restraint incidental to any 
infliction of bodily inj ury or a sexual offense upon [the 
victim],” as required by State v. Sheffield , 146 Hawaiʻi 49, 
61, 456 P.2d 122, 134 (2020); and  
 
(2) whether such plain error, if any, was harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt.  
 
B.  The Sheffield  Case 
 We briefly summarize Sheffield  to provide context for our 
order and for this decision .  In Sheffield , the defendant (David 
M. Sheffield) followed a college student as she walked alone at 
night, announced his intention to beat her up and have sex with 
her, pulled a loop on her backpack as she tried to cross the ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
9 
 street, and dragged her backwards about five to ten steps before 
she broke free.  Sheffield , 146 Hawaiʻi at 50, 456 P.3d at 123.  
Like Ishimine, Sheffield was charged with kidnapping, in 
violation of HRS § 707 -720(1)(d).  Id.  Sheffield was also 
charged with third degree assault.  Sheffield , 146 Hawaiʻi at 51, 
456 P.3d at 124.  Like Ishimine, Sheffield proceeded to trial on 
just the kidnapping charge, because the State moved for, and was 
granted, dismi ssal of Sheffield’s assault in the third degree 
charge before trial.  Sheffield , 146 Hawaiʻi at 51, 456 P.3d at 
124. 
 A jury convicted Sheffield of kidnapping.  Id.  On appeal, 
Sheffield argued that, “when kidnapping is the only count tried, 
the State must  prove the defendant used a greater degree of 
‘restraint’ than that incidentally used to commit the underlying 
unprosecuted assault in the third degree offense.”  Id.  He also 
argued that the jury should be so instructed.  Id.  We agreed.  
Id.   
After exploring the Model Penal Code (“MPC”) and its 
Commentary, our kidnapping statute and its commentary, and the 
majority rule about “incidental restraint” among other 
jurisdictions, we held that “the restraint necessary to support 
a kidnapping convicti on under HRS § 707 -720(1)(d) must be 
restraint that is in excess of any restraint incidental to the 
infliction or intended infliction of bodily injury or subjection ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
10 
 or intended subjection of a person to a sexual offense.” 
Sheffield , 146 Hawaiʻi at 55-59, 456 P.3d at 128 -32.  We also 
held that the jury should be so instructed.  Sheffield , 146 
Hawaiʻi at 60, 456 P.3d at 133.  Such an instruction safeguards 
the defendant against a conviction for kidnapping based on acts 
of restraint incidental to other crimes.  
In arriving at these holdings, we pointed out that the 
MPC’s Commentary characterized prosecution solely for kidnapping 
(in lieu of prosecution for attempted assault or attempted rape) 
as “abusive” and an “end run around the special doctrinal 
protections designed for uncompleted crimes.”  Sheffield , 146 
Hawaiʻi at 58 n.11, 456 P.3d at 131 n.11.  We also questioned 
whether the legislature intended the term “restraint” under our 
statutory scheme to support a kidnapping conviction for acts of 
restraint that a re only incidental to other crimes:  
Consider two examples in which restraint could be employed 
by a defendant with the intent to inflict bodily injury or 
subject another to a sexual offense.  First, a person might 
grab another person’s arm and pull the oth er person a few 
feet to land a punch, but fail to do so.  Second, a person 
might lead another by knifepoint through an alley and into 
a deserted warehouse, for the purpose of committing a 
sexual offense, but eventually fail.  . . .  [B]oth 
defendants may be  convicted of kidnapping, which carries a 
twenty-year prison sentence.  This risk warrants the 
adoption of the rule Sheffield advocates.   
 
Sheffield , 146 Hawaiʻi at 58, 456 P.3d at 131.  
We noted that the majority rule among other jurisdictions 
is that “re straint or movement merely incidental to some other 
crime will not support a conviction for kidnapping.”  Sheffield , ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
11 
 146 Hawaiʻi at 59, 456 P.3d at 132 (citing State v. Trujillo , 289 
P.3d 238, 248 (N.M. Ct. App. 2012)).  We summarized the three 
tests for “incidental restraint or movement” that have emerged 
in these jurisdictions as follows:  
(1) whether the confinement, movement, or detention was 
merely incidental to the accompanying crime or whether it 
was significant enough, in and of itself, to warra nt 
independent prosecution.  
 
(2) whether the detention or movement substantially 
increased the risk of harm over and above that necessarily 
present in the accompanying crime.  
 
(3) when the restraint or movement was done to facilitate 
the commission of anot her crime, the restraint or movement 
must be slight, inconsequential, and merely incidental to 
the other crime, or be the kind of restraint or movement 
inherent in the nature of the other crime.  Under this 
test, the restraint or movement must have some ot her 
significance independent of the other crime, in that it 
makes the other crime substantially easier to commit or 
substantially lessens the risk of detection.  
 
Sheffield , 146 Hawaiʻi at 59, 456 P.3d at 132 (citing Trujillo , 
289 P.3d at 248).  Whether res traint is merely incidental to 
another crime depends on the totality of the circumstances.  
Sheffield , 146 Hawaiʻi at 59, 456 P.3d at 132 (citing Trujillo , 
289 P.3d at 251, 252).   
In Sheffield’s case, we held the circuit court plainly 
erred in failing to instruct the jury on “incidental restraint,” 
and such a failure was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, 
because there was a reasonable possibility that the lack of an 
“incidental restraint” jury instruction contributed to 
Sheffield’s conviction.  Sheffield, 146 Hawaiʻi at 133, 456 P.3d 
at 60.  While we noted that a reasonable jury could find that ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
12 
 Sheffield’s act of restraint (pulling the complaining witness 
back five to ten feet) was more than merely incidental, we 
emphasized that such a question was fo r the jury, properly 
instructed, to decide.  Sheffield , 146 Hawaiʻi at 61, 62, 456 
P.3d at 134, 135.  Therefore, we vacated Sheffield’s conviction 
and remanded his case to the circuit court for further 
proceedings.  Sheffield , 146 Hawaiʻi at 62, 456 P.3d at 135.  
With our Sheffield  decision as a backdrop for Ishimine’s ca se, 
we next address the parties’ arguments in supplemental briefing.      
C.  Arguments in Supplemental Briefing  
 1.  The State’s Arguments  
 The State argues that the trial court did not plainly err 
by failing to provide a Sheffield  instruction to the jury .  The 
State asserts the evidence showed that Ishimine’s use of 
restraint (in forcing the complaining witness out of a vehicle 
then up a flight of stairs and into a residence) was far more 
than incidental to any intended infliction of bodily injury upon 
the complaining witness.   The State points to the three tests 
for incidental restraint we summarized in Sheffield  (i.e., (1) 
whether the restraint was significant, in and of itself, to 
warrant independent prosecution; (2) whether the restraint 
substantially increased the risk of harm over and above that 
necessarily present in the accompanying crime; and (3) whether 
the restraint, done to facilitate commission of another crime, ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
13 
 makes the other crime substantially easier to commit or 
substantially lessens the risk of detection) .  146 Hawaiʻi at 59, 
456 P.3d at 132 (citing Trujillo , 289 P.3d at 248).  The State 
argues that Ish imine’s act of dragging the complaining witness 
up a flight of stairs satisfied all three tests.   First, the 
movement upstairs was “significant enough, in and of itself, to 
warrant independent prosecution” for kidnapping.   Second, the 
movement upstairs “su bstantially increased the risk of harm over 
and above that necessarily present” in abuse of a family or 
household member, because the complaining witness could have 
been injured on the stairs.   Third, Ishimine’s movement of the 
complaining witness up the s tairs, into the dwelling, and into a 
locked bedroom made abuse of a family or household member 
substantially easier to commit and lessened the risk of 
detection, as the crime would have been committed behind closed 
doors. 
 The State also points to the hypo theticals posed in the 
Sheffield  opinion:  
Consider two examples in which restraint could be employed 
by a defendant with the intent to inflict bodily injury or 
subject another to a sexual offense.  First, a person might 
grab another pers on’s arm and pull t he other person a few 
feet to land a punch, but fail to do so.  Second, a person 
might le ad another by knife point through an alley and into 
a deserted warehouse, f or the purpose of committing a 
sexual offense, but eventually fail.  
 
Sheffield , 146 Hawaiʻi at 58, 456 P.3d at 131.  The State quotes 
this court as concluding that the restraint in the first example ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
14 
 was “clearly incidental to the intended infliction of bodily 
injury,” while the restraint in the second example was “much 
more than incidenta l to the intended subjection of a person to a 
sexual offense.”  Id.  The State asserts that Ishimine’s act of 
dragging the complaining witness up the stairs was more like the 
second hypothetical; therefore, no rational juror would have 
found that the restr aint Ishimine used was merely incidental to 
the offense of abuse of a family or household member.   
Consequently, the State argues that the circuit court did not 
plainly err in failing to provide the jury with the Sheffield  
instruction.  
 The State maintains that, even if the trial court plainly 
erred in not providing a Sheffield  instruction to the jury, the 
error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.   The State argues 
that Ishimine’s acts of dragging the CW up a flight of stairs, 
into a dwelling, then holding her in a locked bedroom cannot be 
considered incidental restraint as a matter of law.   Further, 
the State compare s Ishimine’s actions to State v. Hernandez , 
where this court explained that “a short restraint in an area 
where the vict im might suffocate or come to other bodily harm 
would constitute a substantial interference with liberty. . . .”  
61 Haw. 475, 478, 605 P.2d 75, 77 (1980).   The State argues that 
Ishimine forced the complaining witness into a locked bedroom 
within a dwelli ng, with his hand over her mouth; the State ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
15 
 contends that those acts could have caused the complaining 
witness to suffocate or come to other bodily harm.   Therefore, 
the State concludes, the restraint Ishimine used was sufficient 
to support his kidnapping conviction, and no rational jury could 
have found otherwise.    
2.  Ishimine’s Arguments  
 Ishimine counter -argues that the circuit court plainly 
erred in failing to give the jury the Sheffield  instruction, and 
such error was not harmless beyond a reasonabl e doubt.   He 
argues that the circuit court plainly erred in failing to give 
the Sheffield instruction because the jury could have found that 
Ishimine’s acts of pulling the CW from the car or dragging the 
CW up the stairs constituted “restraint,” but if tho se acts 
caused the CW pain, they could have also served as the basis for 
the abuse of family or household member charge.   See HRS § 709 -
906 (2014 & Supp. 2015 & 2016) (criminalizing “physical abuse” 
and “harm” to a family or household member) .  He argues that the 
jury could have also found that Ishimine’s act of holding the CW 
and covering her mouth constituted “restraint,” but if that act 
restricted the CW’s breathing it could have also served as the 
basis for the felony abuse of family or hou sehold member charge.   
See HRS § 709 -906(8) (2014 & Supp. 2015 & 2016)  (punishing abuse 
of a family or household member as a class C felony where the 
defendant “intentionally or knowingly imped[es] the normal ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
16 
 breathing or circulation of the blood of the fa mily or household 
member by applying pressure on the throat or neck. . . .”)  
Ishimine argues that, pursuant to Sheffield , the jury could not 
rely on the restraint incidental to the intended infliction of 
bodily injury as the same restraint supporting the kidnapping 
charge.  Therefore, Ishimine argues, the circuit court plainly 
erred in not providing the jury with the Sheffield  instruction.   
Further, Ishimine maintains, the error was not harmless 
beyond a reasonable doubt, because the omission of a jury 
instruction on restraint diminished Ishimine’s ability to 
present a complete defense against the kidnapping charge.   This 
was because he did not have the opportunity to argue to the jury 
that the restraint supporting the kidnapping charge had to be 
more than  incidental to any restraint necessary to inflict the 
underlying (but  uncharged) conduct of abuse of a family or 
household member.    
D.  Analysis  
 1. A Sheffield  instruction was required  
 Ishimine’s arguments are persuasive.   We hold that the 
circuit court plainly erred by failing to provide the jury with 
an instruction on incidental restraint.  We also conclude that 
the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  While we 
recognize the cogency of the State’s arguments  that Ishimine’s 
act of restraint (namely, dragging the complaining witness up ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
17 
 the stairs and into the locked bedroom) could have been 
independently charged as kidnapping, could have injured the 
complaining witness, and could have facilitated abuse of the 
complaining witness behind closed doors, it is the finder of 
fact that ultimate ly determines whether the restraint Ishimine 
used was more than merely incidental to the dismissed and 
untried abuse of family or household member offenses.  Further, 
an importa nt fact remains:  the State proceeded to trial on just 
the kidnapping charge after dismissing the underlying abuse of 
family or household member charges.  As we alluded to in 
Sheffield , that kind of prosecutorial decision could be 
characterized as “abusive ” and an “end run around the special 
doctrinal protections designed for uncompleted crimes.”  
Sheffield , 146 Hawaiʻi at 58 n.11, 456 P.3d at 131 n.11.   
We agree with Ishimine  that the restraint present in this 
case (dragging the complaining witness from her car, up the 
stairs, and into a locked bedroom, then holding a hand over her 
mouth) likely provided the State with a basis for charging 
Ishimine with the three counts of Abu se of Family or Household 
Member.  After dismissing those counts before trial, however, it 
was unjust for the State to rely on the conduct underlying those 
untried counts to serve as the basis for its kidnapping case.  
This is especially so when considerin g that conviction for 
Kidnapping as a Class A Felony carries with it a 20 -year term of ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
18 
 imprisonment, and conviction for the Abuse of Family or 
Household Member counts carries with it sentences of 
imprisonment of one year for a misdemeanor conviction and fi ve 
years for a Class C Felony conviction.  See HRS § 709 -906 
(5)(a)&(b) (2014 & Supp. 2015 & 2016) & 706 -663 (2014 & Supp. 
2016) (misdemeanor sentencing); HRS § 709 -906(8) (2014 & Supp. 
2015 & 2016) & 706 -660(1)(b)&(2)(b) (2014 & Supp. 2016) (Class C 
felony sentencing).   
Because the abuse of family or household member offenses 
were dismissed and untried, the jury could not have convicted 
Ishimine for “physical[ly] abus[ing] or harm[ing]” the 
complaining witness, as a misdemeanor, under HRS § 709 -906 (2014 
& Supp. 2015 & 2016), for his act of dragging the complaining 
witness from her car, up the stairs, and into a locked bedroom.  
Nor could the jury have convicted Ishimine of felony abuse of a 
family or household member for “intentionally or knowingly 
impeding the normal breathing or circulation of the blood of the 
family or household member by applying pressure on the throat or 
the neck. . . .”  HRS § 709 -906(8)(2014 & Supp. 2015 & 2016).  
Therefore, the jury chose in this case to convict Ishimine 
of kidnappi ng.  Under Sheffield , however, in order for Ishimine 
to have been convicted of kidnapping, the State needed to prove 
that the restraint Ishimine used was more than just the 
restraint incidental to committing the underlying and untried ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
19 
 abuse of family or ho usehold member offenses.  Consequently, we 
hold that the circuit court plainly erred by failing to so 
instruct the jury.  Further, such error was not harmless beyond 
a reasonable doubt, because there was a reasonable possibility 
that the absence of such an  instruction contributed to 
Ishimine’s conviction.  Stated another way, when the jury is not 
made aware that more than just incidental restraint must support 
a kidnapping conviction, the “risk” of conviction based on an 
insufficient showing of restraint ex ists.  Sheffield , 146 Hawaiʻi 
at 58, 456 P.3d at 131.  
We express no opinion as to whether a jury could find 
Ishimine guilty of kidnapping on remand.  As the State points 
out, there are cases in which “a short restraint in an area 
where the victim might suf focate or come to other bodily harm” 
has supported a kidnapping conviction.  See Hernandez , 61 Haw. 
at 478, 605 P.2d at 77.   The power to make this determination 
ultimately rests with the finder of fact, but only after being 
properly instructed on the natu re of the restraint necessary to 
convict a defendant of kidnapping.  
2. Response to dissent  
 The dissent asserts that this opinion “ throws caution to 
the wind to override our adversarial system and address an issue 
Ishimine never raised.”   Dissenting Opinio n at 3.  According to 
the dissent, Ishimine was not without recourse because even if ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
20 
  his appellate counsel did not raise the failure to give a 
Sheffield  instruction, Ishimine could file a Hawaiʻi Rules of 
Penal Procedure Rule 40 post -conviction petition.7  Dissenting 
Opinion at 6 n. 3.  
 First, contrary to the dissent’ s assertion, exercise of 
plain error review does not override the adversarial process , 
even when we address an issue not raised by a defendant .  
Rather, plain error review is a historically well -recognized 
check on the adversarial process, necessary to correct obvious 
injustices.  
 The plain error doctrine has been recognized by the U.S. 
Supreme Court since at least 1896 .  See Wiborg v. U .S., 163 U.S. 
632, 658 (1896) (“[I]f a plain error was committed in a matter 
so absolutely vital to defendants, we feel ourselves at liberty 
to correct it ”).  The doctrine has since developed throughout 
the country, with almost every state hav ing adopted some version 
of the plain error standard of appellate review.  Tory A. 
Weigand, Esq., Raise or Lose: Appellate Discretion and 
 
7  The dissent asserts Ishimine could assert ineffective assistance of 
counsel in such a petition .  Dissenting Opinion at 6 n. 3.  The dissent also 
asserts that  “[i]n holding the missing jury instruction impacted Ishimine’s 
substantial rights, today’s majority questionably condones appellate 
counsel’s provision of what the majority renders ineffective assistance.”  
Dissenting Opinio n at 6 n. 3.  This assertion is unfair to appellate counsel.  
We have never suggested that appellate counsel was ineffective in not raising 
this issue on appeal or on certiorari; Sheffield  was decided after the appeal 
was filed.  ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
21 
 Principled Decision -Making, 17 SUFFOLK J. TRIAL & APP. ADVOC. 179, 
222 (2012).   
Plain error review reflects the “careful balancing of [the 
court’s] need to encourage all trial participants to seek a fair 
and accurate trial the first time around against [the court’s] 
insistence that obvious injustice be promptly redressed.”  U.S. 
v. Frady, 456 U.S. 152, 163  (1982); see also  Weigand, supra, at 
180 (“The discretionary approach to new or unpreserved issues on 
appeal is the result of the collision between the principle of 
party presentation underlying the adversarial process and the 
role of the appellate court as both the guardian of a fair 
proceeding and final arbiter of applicable law. ”).   
 The plain error doctrine applies even when an appellate 
court takes notice of error not brought to its attention by the 
parties.  The U nited States  Supreme Court has long recognized 
its authority to take notice of plain error not raised by a 
defendant.  See, e.g. , United Broth erhood of Carpenters & 
Joiners of Am. v. United States , 330 U.S. 395, 412 (1947)  (“We 
have the power to notice a ‘plain error’ though it is not 
assigned or specified.”) ; accord, Silber v. United States , 370 
U.S. 717, 718 (1962 ).  See also, Greenlaw v. United States , 554 
U.S. 237, 247  (2008) (“This Court has indeed noticed, and 
ordered correction of, plain errors not raised by defendants, ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
22 
 but we have done so only to benefit a defendant who had himself 
petitioned the Court for review on other grounds. ”).   
 Hence, Rule 24(1)(a) of the Rules of the Supreme Court of 
the United States (2019) clearly provides in part, “At its 
option, however, the Court may consider a plain error not among 
the questions presented but evident from the record and 
otherwise within its jurisdiction to  decide.”   
 This court has also historically exercised our authority to 
recognize plain errors not brought to our attention  to redress 
obvious injustice .  See, e.g., Hernandez , 61 Haw. at 481, 605 
P.2d at 79 (lack of sufficient evidence to support conviction 
for specif ic type of sexual abuse); State v. Grindles , 70 Haw. 
528, 530, 777 P.2d 1187, 1189 (1989 ) 
(defendant required to put on evidence before conclusion of 
State’s evidence); State v. Getz , 131 Hawaiʻi 19, 27, 313 P.3d 
708, 716 (2013)  (failure to issue specific unanimity 
instruction) ; State v. DeLeon , 131 Hawaiʻi 463, 485, 319 P.3d 
382, 404 (2014)  (preclusion of doctor’s testimony regarding 
probable effects of cocaine on decedent) .  
 The dissent cites to dicta in our cases saying “a party 
must look to [their] counsel for protection and bear the cost of 
counsel’s mistakes.”  State v. Kelekolio , 74 Haw. 479, 515, 849 
P.2d 58, 75 (1993); State v. Fox , 70 Haw. 46, 55 -56, 760 P.2d 
670, 675 -76 (1988).  The dissent fails to acknowledge, however, ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
23 
 that in th ose very cases, we exercised plain error review to 
correct obvious injustices.  In Kelekolio , we noticed plain 
error due to the trial court’s failure to  conduct a competency 
hearing before complainant’s testimony . 74 Haw. at 523-24, 849 
P.2d at 78.  In Fox, we noticed  plain error due to the  trial 
court’s admission of evidence grounded on statements made in the 
course of plea discussions . 70 Haw. at 56, 760 P.2d at 676. 
 Thus, plain error review has long been exercised  by courts 
in this country as a necessary tool to correct obvious 
injustice s that otherwise occur in the adversarial system. 
Accordingly, Rule 52(b) of the Hawaiʻi Rules of Penal Procedure 
provides that “[p]lain errors or defects affecting substantial 
rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the 
attention of the co urt.”  And Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate 
Procedure  (“HRAP”)  Rule 28 (b)(4)(D) provides in part:    
 Points not presented in accordance with this section 
will be disregarded, except that the appellate court, at 
its option, may notice a plain error not presented. If an 
appellate court, when acting on a case on appeal, 
contemplates basing the disposition of the case wholly or 
in part upon an issue of plain error not raised by the 
parties through briefing, it shall not affirm, reverse, or 
vacate the case w ithout allowing the parties the 
opportunity to brief the potential plain -error issue prior 
to disposition.  . . . 
  
The second sentence from HRAP Rule 28 (b)(4)(D) quoted above was 
added effective January 1, 2022.   
 Moreover , second, the dissent  does not even discuss the 
fact that this court  unanimously ordered supplemental briefing ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
24 
 on the issue s pursuant to this recently -added language. Hence, 
both Ishimine and the State submitted supplemental briefing and 
argued their positions on the question s addressed.     
 Third, with respect to the dissent’s allegedly available 
“recourse,” Ishimine  would not have been entitled to counsel if 
his conviction was affirmed by this court without addressing the 
failure to give a Sheffield  instruction.  Thus, he may never 
have become aware of the issue.  Even if he did and he then 
filed a pro se Rule 40 pet ition in the circuit court, whether or 
not the circuit court found a colorable claim and appointed 
counsel, there would be a substantial delay before the issue 
ever reached this court.  Defendants should not have to languish 
before courts address whether t heir substantial rights have been 
violated.  Rather, fundamentally, this court has the 
jurisdiction, power, and obligation to “promot[e] justice in 
matters pending before it.”8  Thus, contrary to the dissent’s 
assertion,  our “invocation of plain error jur isdiction” neither 
“constitutes judicial overreach” nor “substantially undermines 
our adversarial system.”  Dissenting Opinion at 2.  
 The dissent also asserts that we “silently dismiss[] our 
precedent . . . for determining . . . whether the 
 
8  We have repeatedly cited to HRS § 602-5(6) (2016), which provides this 
court with “jurisdiction and power []” “[t]o . . . take such  . . . steps as 
may be necessary to carry into full effect the powers which are o r shall be 
given to it by law or for the promotion of justice in matters pending before 
it.” ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
25 
 [instructional]  defect was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.”  
Dissenting Opinion at 1-2.  We disagree.  We have clearly held 
that “an appellate court will reverse for plain error in jury 
instructions where the error cannot be said to be harmless 
beyond a reasonable doubt ( i.e., considering the record as a 
whole, there is a reasonable possibility that the error 
contributed to the defendant's conviction). ” State v. Nichols, 
111 Hawaiʻi 327, 329, 141 P.3d 974, 976 (2006).     The dissent would 
rule as a matter of law that the restraint exercised here was 
more than incidental.  Dissenting Opinion at 8.   Although we 
recognize the cogency of the State’s arguments regarding the 
three tests for incidental restraint , the finder of fa ct is the 
ultimate arbiter of the degree of restraint Ishimine used 
against the complaining witness . 
 Further, the dissent erroneously asserts that we “silently 
dismiss[] our precedent identifying three tests for determining 
whether the jury instruction wa s necessary. . . .”  Dissenting 
Opinion at 1-2.  The dissent misunderstands the purpose of the 
three tests.  The three tests assist the jury in understanding 
whether the restraint used by the defendant could support a 
kidnapping conviction because the rest raint is more than just 
incidental to the commission of some other crime.  See 
Sheffield , 146 Hawaiʻi at 59, 456 P.3d at 132 (“The Trujillo  
court noted that the majority rule among other jurisdictions is ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
26     /s/ Sabrina S. McKenna 
   /s/ Michael D. Wilson 
   /s/ Todd W. Eddins  
 that restraint or movement merely incidental to some other crime 
will not support a conviction for kidnapping.  In these other 
jurisdictions, three formulations of the  majority rule have 
emerged for determining whether a restraint or movement is 
“incidental” to another crime.) (citing Trujillo , 289 P.3d at 
248).  The three tests are not, as the dissent argues, used to 
“determin[e] whether the jury instruction was necess ary.”  
Dissenting Opinion at 2.    
Hence, considering this record as a whole, there is a 
reasonable possibility the failure to give a Sheffield  
instruction contributed to the kidnapping conviction.  In 
contrast with the dissent, “we are unwilling to specula te as to 
what the jury would have done had it been given a proper  . . .  
instruction.”  See Nichols, 111 Hawaiʻi at 340, 141 P.3d at 987.  
V.  Conclusion  
 The circuit court in this case plainly erred by failing to 
provide the jury with a Sheffield  instruction.  This error was 
not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  Consequently, we vacate 
the ICA’s April 15, 2020 judgment on appeal and remand this case 
to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with 
this opinion.
