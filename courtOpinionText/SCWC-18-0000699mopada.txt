 foreclosure (“MSJ”) against Watoshina Lynn Compton (“Compton”). 
U.S. Bank initiated foreclosure proceedings against Compton 
in January 2017.  In February 2018, U.S. Bank moved for summary 
judgment.  U.S. Bank supported its MSJ with loan documents, 
including a promissory note (the “Note”) executed by Compton in 
favor of Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. (“Countrywide”).  Two 
declarations also supported U.S. Bank’s MSJ.  Carol Davis, an 
employee of Nationstar Mortgage LLC, U.S. Bank’s loan servicer, prepared one; Gina Santellan, a custodian of records for U.S. 
Bank’s counsel, wrote the other. 
The circuit court granted U.S. Bank’s motion.  It entered 
judgment for U.S. Bank.  Compton appealed.  On appeal, Compton 
argued that because U.S. Bank had not established its possession 
of the Note at the time it filed its complaint, the circuit 
court had erred in concluding U.S. Bank had standing to sue.  
The ICA agreed.  It ruled that because neither Davis nor 
Santellan could speak to the record-keeping practices of the Note’s creator, Countrywide, the Note could not be admitted 
under the business records exception to the hearsay rule.  Given 
the inadmissibility of the Note, the ICA concluded, U.S. Bank 
was not entitled to summary judgment: there was a “genuine issue 
of material fact as to whether U.S. Bank had standing to 
initiate this foreclosure action when it was commenced.” 
On certiorari, U.S. Bank presents two questions: (1) “To *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 introduce a promissory note into evidence, must a creditor 
satisfy the business records exception to the hearsay rule?” and 
(2) “If a party incorporates a third party’s records into its 
own, must it present testimony about the third party’s record-
keeping in order to satisfy the business records exception?” 
We answered these questions in U.S. Bank v. Verhagen, SCWC-
17-0000746 (Haw. June 21, 2021).  
As we explained in Verhagen, promissory notes are not 
hearsay because they have independent legal significance.  Here, U.S. Bank presented the Note to establish Compton’s legal 
obligation to the Note’s holder.  The Note was therefore not 
hearsay and need not fall within an exception to the hearsay 
rule to be admissible. 
Our opinion in Verhagen also explained that under the 
incorporated records doctrine, the foundation for the admission 
of business records incorporated into the records of a receiving 
business can, in certain cases, be established by testimony from a custodian or other witness qualified to testify about the 
record-keeping practices of the incorporating business.  The ICA 
thus erred in ruling that the Note was inadmissible absent 
testimony about its creator’s record-keeping systems. 
Here, U.S. Bank has submitted admissible evidence that 
collectively shows it possessed the original Note, indorsed in 
blank, at the time it sued Compton.  Compton has not set forth *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 any “specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue” as to
whether U.S. Bank actually possessed the Note at the time it 
filed suit.  See Hawaiʻ i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 56(e).  By
showing it possessed and was entitled to enforce the Note when 
it filed its complaint, U.S. Bank has established its standing 
to foreclose against Compton.  See Bank of Am., N.A. v. Reyes-
Toledo, 139 
Hawai‘i 361, 390 P.3d 1248 (2017) (holding that to 
establish standing a foreclosing plaintiff must show it was 
entitled to enforce the subject note when the lawsuit began).  
The circuit court correctly determined that U.S. Bank provided 
Compton the necessary notice of default.  The Note is valid and 
Compton is in default under its terms.  U.S. Bank is thus 
entitled to summary judgment.    
 
Accordingly, we hold the ICA erred in reversing the circuit 
court’s grant of summary judgment to U.S. Bank.  We vacate the ICA’s memorandum opinion and judgment on appeal and affirm the 
circuit court’s findings of fact, conclusions of law and order
