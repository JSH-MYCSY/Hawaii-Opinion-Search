 Agdinaoay challenges the court’s sentence, which the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals affirmed.  He argues the family 
court erred by sentencing him to both serve 181 days and 
complete DVI.  Imposing DVI without probation, Agdinaoay argues, 
violates 
Hawai‘i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 706-624(2)(a) (Supp. 
2017).  
We hold that courts cannot impose imprisonment exceeding 
the statutory threshold for a probationary sentence and also 
conditions of probation.  Because a misdemeanor defendant 
sentenced to imprisonment exceeding 180 days cannot also receive 
a probationary sentence - and DVI cannot be imposed except as a 
condition of probation - Agdinoay’s sentence was unlawful. 
I. 
After Agdinaoay pled no contest to Violation of a Temporary 
Restraining Order (VTRO), the family court convicted him of 
violating HRS § 586-4.  That statute requires defendants 
convicted of VTRO to “undergo domestic violence intervention at 
any available domestic violence program as ordered by the 
court.”  HRS § 586-4(e).1 
                                                 
1  In addition to mandating that those convicted of VTRO undergo DVI, HRS 
§ 586-4(e) classifies VTRO as a misdemeanor: 
 
(e) When a temporary restraining order is granted and the 
respondent or person to be restrained knows of the order, a 
knowing or intentional violation of the restraining order is a misdemeanor.  A person convicted under this section 
shall undergo domestic violence intervention at any 
available domestic violence program as ordered by the 
court.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 The court sentenced Agdinaoay to DVI.  It also sentenced 
him to 181 days of imprisonment. 
This sentence was illegal.  Its illegality emerges from the 
confluence of two distinct conclusions.  First, that DVI is not 
available to sentencing courts as a “standalone” sentencing 
option; it must be imposed with probation.  And second, that a 
court cannot impose both probation and a sentence of greater 
than 180 days for a misdemeanor offense. 
Agdinaoay’s sentence was unlawful because it combined DVI – 
which we conclude is only available as a condition of probation - and imprisonment exceeding six months.  See HRS § 706-
624(2)(a).  The trial court could have imposed a 181-day prison term.  Or it could have imposed probation with DVI as a 
condition.  But it could not mix and match as it did. 
II. 
 Our first conclusion - that DVI is only available as part 
of a probation sentence - makes sense for three reasons.    First, the plain language of Chapter 706 shows that DVI is 
not available except as a condition of probation.   
HRS Chapter 706 guides sentencing.  It starts: “No sentence 
shall be imposed otherwise than in accordance with this 
chapter.”  HRS § 706-600 (emphasis added).  The command is 
clear.  Chapter 706 controls all sentencing dispositions, even 
those dictated by statutes outside its purview.  See  HRS § 701-*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
4 
 102(3) (“The provisions of chapters 701 through 706 of the Code 
are applicable to offenses defined by other statutes, unless the
Code otherwise provides.”).  Other statutes may supplement the 
penal code, for example by providing mandatory minimums, but 
Chapter 706’s overarching sentencing framework still controls.2 
 
Under HRS § 706-605, the court may sentence a convicted 
defendant to one or more of four dispositions: (1) probation; 
(2) payment of a fine; (3) imprisonment; and (4) community service. 
                                                 
2  Nothing in HRS § 701-102(3) or HRS § 706-600 restricts action by 
subsequent legislatures.   The legislature can amend laws concerning criminal 
sentencing.  But the legislature has left HRS § 701- 102(3) and HRS § 706- 600 
intact.  Because those laws remain intact all sentencing – even that informed 
by laws outside the penal code – must occur in accordance with Chapter 706.  
Cf. Peer News LLC v. City & County of Honolulu, 138 Hawai‘ i 53, 69, 376 P.3d 
1, 17 (2016) (“The legislature is presumed to know the law when it enacts 
statutes . . . .”).

Criminal sentences other than the four outlined in HRS 
§ 706-605 defy Chapter 706.3,4,5 
DVI is not one of the four authorized dispositions under 
HRS § 706-605.  But there are several subsections of HRS § 706-
624(2) that allow a court to impose DVI as a condition of 
probation.  Under HRS § 706-624(2), a court imposing probation 
may order a defendant to: “[u]ndergo available medical or mental 
health assessment and treatment . . . .” HRS § 706-624(2)(j); “[c]omply with a service plan developed using current assessment 
tools” HRS § 706-624(2)(s); and “[s]atisfy other reasonable 
                                                 
3  This proposition is nicely illustrated by the ICA’s holding in State v. 
DeMello, 130 Hawai‘i  332, 310 P.3d 1033 (App. 2013),  vacated in part, 136 
Hawai‘i 193, 361 P.3d 420 (2015).  In DeMello, the ICA considered whether the 
trial court erred in sentencing a defendant, who had been convicted of a 
petty misdemeanor, to the maximum term of imprisonment and anger management 
classes.  There was no standalone provision in Chapter 706 authorizing sentencing courts to impose “anger management classes” on defendants.  But, the ICA noted, attendance at anger management classes could be imposed as a 
condition of probation.  Because DeMello had been sentenced to thirty days of 
imprisonment, however, he could not also be sentenced to probation.  Id. at 
340, 310 P.3d at 1041.  Probation, with completion of anger management 
classes as one of its conditions, would be a valid sentence.  So too would 
thirty days of imprisonment.  But because of Chapter 706’s limits on the term 
of imprisonment that could be imposed alongside probation, DeMello’s sentence 
of thirty days of imprisonment plus a probationary condition (anger 
management classes) was illegal.  Id. 
 
4  Mandatory minimums required by statutes outside the penal code - f or 
example HRS § 586-4(e)(1)’s requirement that those convicted of VTRO serve at 
least forty- eight hours in jail - do not inherently conflict with Chapter 706 
since imprisonment is an authorized disposition of a criminal defendant under both HRS § 706-605(a) and HRS § 706-605(c). 
 
5  The penal code concerns the sentencing of criminal defendants.  It is 
silent on the permissible scope of court orders concerning civil litigants.  The fact that family court judges may impose DVI as part of a protective order in a civil court case is thus irrelevant to the question of whether DVI 
may be imposed as a standalone criminal sentence: the sentencing judge in a 
criminal case operates within the framework provided by Chapter 706, the civil judge in a family court dispute does not. 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 conditions as the court may impose.”  HRS § 706-624(2)(t).   
Read 
together, the absence of “DVI” as a “standalone” authorized 
disposition for convicted defendants under HRS § 706-605 and the 
express authorization of “mental health treatment” such as DVI 
as a discretionary condition of probation indicate that DVI is 
imposable only as a condition of probation. 6
Second, other sections of the Hawai‘ i Penal Code treat DVI 
as a sentence that is imposed only alongside probation. 
In 1998, the legislature extended the probation period for 
the misdemeanor domestic violence crimes7 from one year to a 
                                                 
6  HRS § 706-624(2) empowers courts to impose an assortment of 
discretionary conditions on probationers: 
 
(2) Discretionary conditions.  The court may provide, as further 
conditions of a sentence of probation, to the extent that the conditions are reasonably related to the factors set forth in 
section 706- 606 and to the extent that the conditions involve 
only deprivations of liberty or property as are reasonably necessary for the purposes indicated in section 706- 606(2), that 
the defendant: 
 
 
. . . . 
 
(j) Undergo available medical or mental health 
assessment and treatment, including assessment and treatment for substance abuse dependency, and remain 
in a specified facility if required for that purpose;
 
 
. . . . 
 
(s) Comply with a service plan developed using 
current assessment tools; and 
(t) Satisfy other reasonable conditions as the court 
may impose. 
 
7  These include: violation of temporary restraining order, HRS § 586-4; 
violation of an order for protection, HRS § 586-11; and abuse of family or 
household members, HRS § 709-906. 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 period “not exceeding two years.”  See HRS § 706-623(c).  The 
legislative history reflects that the law changed because 
offenders needed more time to complete DVI 
as part of their 
probation sentences.   
If the legislature believed courts could 
impose DVI without probation, it would have been unnecessary to 
extend the length of probation so that offenders could complete 
DVI during probation. 8
The language of HRS § 709-906(5), the misdemeanor abuse of 
family or household members offense, also supports the conclusion that DVI is imposed only as part of a probationary 
term.  If a person convicted under HRS § 709-906(5) does not 
complete DVI within a specified time frame, “[t]he court shall 
revoke [that] defendant’s probation” unless good cause excuses 
the failure.  HRS § 709-906(7) (emphasis added).  This language 
                                                 
8  The legislative history to H.B. No. 2666 states, in part:  
 
Finally, your Committee has incorporated into H.B. 2666 the 
provisions of H.B. 3190, which also relates to domestic 
violence.  H.B. 3190 covers the same subject matter as H.B. 
2666.  The purpose of H.B. 3190 is to allow the court to 
extend the period of probation for a defendant convicted of misdemeanor domestic abuse if the defendant is unable to 
complete the ordered treatment or counseling within the 
original probation period. 
 
However, your Committee finds that extending a period of probation after that period has been set by the court may 
be unconstitutional.  Accordingly, your Committee has 
changed the provisions of H.B. 3190 by allowing the court 
to sentence a defendant convicted under sections 586-4 or 
709-906, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to a probationary period 
of up to two years.

 reflects an assumption that only probationers will be ordered to 
complete DVI. 
Third, several practical considerations also support our 
holding that DVI is available to sentencing courts only
 as a 
condition of probation.  Chief among them is the court’s inability to enforce a sentence of DVI without probation: if the 
defendant is not on probation and, by extension, subject to 
revocation of that probation, then there are no consequences to not starting, or not finishing, DVI.  A contempt charge under 
HRS § 710-1077 does not work.  See State v. Asuncion, 120 Hawai‘ i 
312, 327, 205 P.3d 577, 592 (App. 2009) (reversing criminal 
contempt conviction of defendant who violated a condition of his probation and explaining that “[w]hen the defendant fails to 
comply with [the conditions of the defendant’s probation], HRS 
§ 706–625
9 provides the exclusive remedies for sanctioning the 
defendant’s failure”).10 
                                                 
9  HRS § 706–625 concerns the revocation and modification of probation 
conditions.  Under HRS § 706–625(3), “[t]he court shall revoke probation if 
the defendant has inexcusably failed to comply with a substantial requirement 
imposed as a condition of the order . . . .” 
 
10  Accord State v. Jones, 869 N.W.2d 24, 29 (Minn. 2015) (holding that “a 
term of probation is not a court mandate, the violation of which subjects the probationer to a new criminal contempt charge”); State v. Williams, 560 A.2d 
100, 104– 05 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1989) (“We do not believe that when 
the Legislature expressly stated . . . that the sanction for a violation of 
probation (other than for the inherent criminality of the act) would be a 
revocation of probation, it intended that a defendant would be subject to a new indictment for contempt in addition to the punishment for the original 
offense.”); Jones v. United States, 560 A.2d 513, 516 (D.C. 1989) (“When a 
probationer violates a condition of his probation, the only appropriate 
sanction is a withdrawal of the previously afforded favorable treatment 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

  Even if one accepts for the purpose of argument that DVI 
could be imposed without probation, a contempt charge under HRS 
§ 710-1077 is not a viable means to punish a defendant who does 
not complete DVI.  Under HRS § 710-1077(g), a person commits 
criminal contempt of court if the person “knowingly disobeys or 
resists the process, injunction, or other mandate of a court.”  
A sentence is neither a process, nor an injunction, nor a 
mandate of the court.  Courts do have “inherent equity, 
supervisory, and administrative powers as well as inherent power 
to control the litigation process before them.”  Enos v. Pac. 
Transfer & Warehouse, Inc., 79 Hawai‘ i 452, 457, 903 P.2d 1273, 
1278 (1995) (cleaned up).  But these inherent powers to 
administer and manage the litigation process are not the source 
of courts’ sentencing authority.  Chapter 706 is.  As such, 
sentences are not processes, injunctions, or other mandates of a 
court.  And, by extension, failure to complete a sentence is not 
criminal contempt. 
 Relying on the specter of a contempt charge to motivate defendants’ DVI completion also presents profound fairness and separation-of-powers problems. 
                                                 
rather than the imposition of an additional penalty.  Punishment for contempt 
is an additional and separate penalty.”); Williams v. State,  528 A.2d 507, 
510 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1987) (“[A] condition of probation may be enforced 
only through the power to revoke the probation, not through contempt 
proceedings.”). 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

Regarding the fairness problem: if failure to complete 
court-ordered DVI may give rise to a contempt charge punishable 
by up to one year in prison, defendants could receive combined 
terms of imprisonment far in excess of the maximum term for 
their underlying misdemeanor crime.11 
 Punishing failure to complete DVI with criminal contempt also presents a separation-of-powers problem.  Under HRS § 710-
1077(1)(g), a person commits criminal contempt of court if “[t]he person knowingly disobeys or resists the process, 
injunction, or other mandate of a court.”  The commentary to 
section 710-1077 makes clear that the purpose of the criminal 
contempt statute is safeguarding the court’s authority.  It 
defines criminal contempt as “conduct which brings the court 
into disrespect or which interferes with the administration of 
justice” (emphasis added).  But if every knowing failure to 
timely complete a DVI sentence generates a criminal contempt 
charge under HRS § 710-1077(1)(g), the government could charge a defendant with contempt even “in the face of the . . . court’s 
                                                 
11  For example, if Agdinaoay served his 181- day prison term (or if he were 
initially sentenced to, and served, the one- year maximum) and then received 
another one- year jail term based on a contempt charge for failing to complete 
DVI, he would have to serve a one- and-one-half or two- year term of 
imprisonment.  Even though the VTRO crime that originally subjected him to 
the family court’s jurisdiction capped incarceration at one year!  If the family court again required Agdinaoay to complete DVI, and he again did not 
do it, he could face yet another year in jail for contempt.  Apocalyptically, 
the pattern could repeat, subjecting Agdinaoay to years of incarceration all 
because of a single misdemeanor charge that carried a maximum one- year term.

 determination that the [defendant] had not demonstrated any 
disrespect [to the court].”  Jones,  869 N.W.2d at 29.  Cf. id. 
at 29 (noting that allowing criminal contempt charges for probation violations would “impinge on the district court’s 
obligation and authority to sentence”).  Construing Chapter 706 
to allow for DVI 
only as a condition of probation avoids a 
   
cannot use contempt charges to intrude on courts’ sentencing powers anytime a defendant sentenced to DVI fails to complete 
that sentence. It ensures that the government separation-of-powers problem.
1312
 A second consideration which suggests that the Hawai‘ i Penal 
Code allows for the imposition of DVI only
 as a condition of 
probation is the significant support available to probationers, but not other offenders.  Only probationers can receive services 
from the Adult Client Services Branch (ACSB).  ACSB’s probation 
officers help ensure defendants’ success in complying with 
probation terms like DVI.  A probation officer is “a helper, a 
                                                 
12  In Jones, the defendant violated the terms of her probation when she 
was cited for consumption of alcohol by a minor and disorderly conduct.  The 
court revoked her probation.  But it did not cite her for contempt or refer 
her for prosecution under Minnesota’s criminal contempt statute.  
Nevertheless, the State charged the defendant with criminal contempt.  869 
N.W.2d at 30. 
 
13  Constitutional doubt is a “well- settled canon of statutory 
construction.”  In re Doe, 96 Hawai‘ i 73, 81, 26 P.3d 562, 570 (2001).  It 
counsels that “where a statute is susceptible of two constructions, by one of 
which grave and doubtful constitutional questions arise and by the other of 
which such questions are avoided, our duty is [to] adopt the latter.”  Id. 
(quoting Jones v. United States, 529 U.S. 848, 857 (2000)).   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
12 
 monitor, and an enforcer.”  State v. Fields, 67 Haw. 268, 280, 
686 P.2d 1379, 1388 (1984).  Probation officers are required to 
“aid and guide” probationers and “to evaluate and report on 
[probationers’] progress toward integration into the 
community . . . .”  Id.  Cf. HRS § 806-73 (providing that a 
probation officer “shall use all suitable methods to aid the 
defendant and bring about an improvement in the defendant’s 
conduct and condition”). 
 The support provided by ACSB’s probation officers is a 
vital lifeline for many defendants sentenced to DVI.  DVI lasts 
months and is often time intensive.  Many defendants are 
indigent and lack the resources to pay for DVI.  Some do not 
speak English.  Others may not have the executive functioning 
necessary to identify and enroll in court-approved DVI.  It 
would be absurd and impracticable to construe HRS § 586-4(e) as requiring these defendants to locate, enroll in, pay for, and 
complete court-approved DVI without any support or guidance from the probation office.
14  We decline to do so.  See Frank v. Haw. 
                                                 
14  After sentencing, Agdinaoay filed an ex parte motion for 
reconsideration of his sentence.  At the hearing on that motion, Agdinaoay’s 
counsel explained some of the practical difficulties Agdinaoay would face if 
he had to complete DVI without support from the ACSB: 
 
Mr. Agdinaoay, I mean, he’ s of limited means, he is a 
houseless individual . . .  I don’ t know if he’ s got the 
resources to even pay for [DVI], let alone know who to ask about those classes.  When you’ re under supervised -- if 
you’re under supervision with the court, with probation, 
they at least will inform you, look, here is the classes,

(1998) (“This court is bound to construe statutes so as to avoid 
absurd results.  A rational, sensible and practicable 
interpretation of a statute is preferred to one which is 
unreasonable, impracticable . . . inconsistent, contradictory, 
and illogical.” (cleaned up)). 
 Collectively, the plain language of Chapter 706, the penal 
code’s consistent treatment of DVI as a condition of probation, 
and the impracticability of enforcing or requiring DVI outside 
the probation context all support our holding that DVI may only 
be imposed as a condition of probation. 
III. 
 The second legal conclusion underpinning our determination concerning the illegality of Agdinaoay’s sentence is the black-
letter law – inspired by the Model Penal Code
15 - that sentencing 
courts may not impose probation and also terms of imprisonment in excess of certain statutorily-defined limits.  See HRS § 706-
624(2)(a) (stating that defendants may not be sentenced to probation and a term of imprisonment exceeding: two years in a class A felony; eighteen months in a class B felony; one year in 
                                                 
this is how many you can take, this is where you can go.  
But he has nobody to tell him what to do or who to do that. 
 
15  “The Hawai‘i Penal  Code is substantially derived from the Model Penal 
Code.”  State v. Aiwohi, 109 Hawai‘ i 115 , 126, 123 P.3d 1210, 1221 (2005). 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
14 
 a class C felony; six months in a misdemeanor; and five days in 
a petty misdemeanor); Model Penal Code § 6.02(3)(b) (stating 
that persons convicted of a felony or misdemeanor and placed on 
probation may be sentenced to a term of imprisonment not 
exceeding thirty days (!) as a condition of probation). 
 We recognized this principle in State v. Sumera, 97 Hawai‘ i 
430, 39 P.3d 557 (2002).  In Sumera, we held that “where the 
sentencing court decides to combine probation and imprisonment 
in a sentence, it may do so if imprisonment is made 
a condition of the sentence of probation rather than a separate 
sentence, and only up to a maximum period of six months in the 
case of a misdemeanor.”  Id. at 435, 39 P.3d at 562. 
IV. 
 Synthesizing our determination that DVI is only available 
as a condition of probation and the black-letter law that, in a 
misdemeanor case, probation may not be imposed alongside a 
prison term exceeding 180 days, we hold that a court may not 
impose both DVI and prison time in excess of that allowed by HRS 
§ 706-624(2)(a).  Agdinaoay’s sentence was thus illegal. 
 What sentences could the court legally have imposed on 
Agdinaoay?  It could have imposed either a sentence of between 
181 days and one year or probation with DVI as a condition of 
that probation and no more than 180 days of imprisonment. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
15 
  Though HRS § 586-4(e) apparently requires courts to 
sentence those convicted of VTRO to DVI, and by extension, 
probation, it also provides that “[n]othing in this section 
shall be construed as limiting the discretion of the judge to 
impose additional sanctions authorized in sentencing for a 
misdemeanor.” 
 One sanction authorized in sentencing for a misdemeanor is 
a term of imprisonment of up to one year.  The State insists 
that DVI must be imposed, without exception, on those convicted 
of VTRO.  But DVI is only available as a condition of probation, 
and probation is not available in conjunction with a sentence of 
more than 180 days.  So taken to its logical conclusion, the 
State’s interpretation of HRS § 586-4 would limit the court’s 
discretion to impose a sentence of more than 180 days on those 
convicted of VTRO.  This outcome is absurd and expressly 
foreclosed by HRS § 586-4(e). 
 If a court sentences a defendant to probation and, as a 
condition of that probation, a term of imprisonment of no more 
than 180 days, then it must also, under HRS § 586-4(e), sentence 
the defendant to DVI. 
 But if a court exercises its discretion to impose a 
sentence of between 181 days and one year, then it may not 
impose probation.  And, because DVI is only available as a 
condition of probation, it may not impose DVI. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
16 
  This outcome is akin to the situation that arises when the 
State charges a defendant with felony crimes and also a 
misdemeanor domestic violence crime like abuse of family or 
household members or VTRO.16  In such cases, the indeterminate 
term of incarceration controls and the defendant – despite the misdemeanor domestic violence conviction – is not sentenced to 
probation or DVI.  This is because under HRS §§ 706-605(2) and 
706-629(1)(a),
17 if a defendant receives a five, ten, or twenty-
year sentence, the court cannot also sentence the defendant to 
DVI for the misdemeanor domestic violence crime. 
 This holding is also required notwithstanding HRS § 586-
4(e)’s unqualified and “specific” command that DVI be imposed on 
any defendants convicted of VTRO.  It is generally true that 
“where there is a ‘plainly irreconcilable’ conflict between a 
general and a specific statute concerning the same subject 
matter, the specific will be favored.”  Mahiai v. Suwa, 69 Haw. 
349, 356, 742 P.2d 359, 366 (1987).  But this principle is a mere tool of statutory interpretation designed for use where 
legislative intent is unclear.  It does not override or 
                                                 
16  The situation also crops up in felony probation revocation cases.  
Consider the felony probationer who receives an indeterminate term of 
incarceration for violating probation conditions and has a pending 
misdemeanor domestic violence crime.  Later, the misdemeanor offense cannot 
be resolved by imposing DVI or anything other than straight imprisonment. 
 
17  Under HRS § 7 06-629(1)(a), when the disposition of a defendant involves 
more than one crime, “[t]he court shall not impose a sentence of probation and a sentence of imprisonment except as authorized by section 706-
624(2)(a) . . . .” *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 undermine otherwise clear legislative intent.  See Cal. State 
Emps. Ass’n v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 267 Cal. App. 2d 667, 
670 (Cal. Ct. App. 1968) (noting that the rule that specific 
governs the general should not be “applied so as to defeat 
legislative intent otherwise determined”); D.B. v. Cardall, 826 
F.3d 721, 736 (4th Cir. 2016) (“The general-specific rule of 
statutory construction, like other interpretive canons, can be 
overcome by sufficient indications of a contrary legislative intent.”). 
Here, HRS § 706-600 is clear: “[n]o sentence shall be 
imposed otherwise than in accordance with this chapter.”  And 
HRS § 701-102(3) explicitly states that Chapter 706’s provisions 
“are applicable to offenses defined by other statutes, unless 
the Code otherwise provides.”  These statutes direct that all 
sentencing in our state happen in accordance with Chapter 706.  
HRS § 586-4’s DVI directive may be “specific,” but that 
specificity does not supersede Chapter 706’s comprehensive 
sentencing framework.  
V. 
We hold that courts cannot impose imprisonment exceeding 
the statutory threshold for a probationary sentence and also impose conditions of probation.  The family court unlawfully 
sentenced Agdinaoay to 181 days of imprisonment and a domestic 
violence intervention program.  It could have sentenced him to *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 one or the other, but not both.  The family court’s sentence is 
vacated.  We remand the case to the family court for re-
sentencing consistent with this opinion. William H. Jameson Jr.,
