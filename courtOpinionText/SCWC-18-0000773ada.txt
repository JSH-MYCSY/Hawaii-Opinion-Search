OPINION OF THE COURT BY WILSON, J. 
 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
  
This case arises from the termination of Petitioner/ 
Appellant mother’s  (“Mother”)  parental rights as to her children 
L.I. and H.D.K.  Mother asserts that the F amily Court of the 
Second Circuit1 (“family court”) erred in failing to appoint 
counsel prior to the grant of foster custody.

2   The instant appeal also makes apparent an 
inconsistency in this court’s opinion in  In re T.M., 131 Hawaiʻi 
419, 319 P.3d 338 (2014), regarding  when counsel must be 
appointed for a parent in a child custody proceeding. 
  The failure to appoint Mother counsel at the time the 
Department of Human Services (“DHS”) filed a petition for foster 
custody violates In re T.M., and was thus, structural error.  As 
discussed below, however, because foster custody or termination 
of parental rights is possible upon the filing of a petition for 
family supervision, we now further hold that Mother should have 
been appointed counsel at the time DHS filed its petition for 
family supervision.  Accordingly, we vacate  the Intermediate 
Court of Appeals’ (“ICA”) Judgment on Appeal affirming the 
family court’s order granting DHS foster custody and subsequent 
order terminating Mother’s parental rights  and remand. 
II.  BACKGROUND2 
  
Mother has two children, L.I., who was born on 
December 22, 2012, and H.D.K, who was born on June 18, 2015. 
DHS’s involvement with L.I. and H.D.K. began  after a report of 
Mother’s substance use.  Mother adm itted to her substance abuse 
problem during an interview with DHS.   On June 13, 2014, DHS 
                     
2  The procedural history of this case will not be fully discussed 
as the only issue before this court is whether the family court erred when it 
failed to appoint Mother counsel prior to the grant of foster custody.   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
3 filed its Petition for Family Supervision of Mother’s then-only 
child, L.I., and on June 24, 2014, Mother consented to family 
supervision of L.I. 
  On July 22, 2014, Mother agreed to her  first service 
plan, which required her  to participate in a  substance abuse 
assessment and recommended treatment, to receive individual 
counseling, to be responsible for L.I. ’s needs, and to cooperate 
with DHS.  
  On January 13, 2015, the family court conducted a 
periodic review hearing , where DHS’s  Safe Family Home Report 
(“SFHR”) filed on January 9, 2015 was admitted by the court,  
which documented Mother’s inability to “ manage her life ” and 
care for L.I.  The family court revoked family supervision an d 
placed L.I. in foster care with DHS effective January 13, 2015.   
Additionally, the f amily court ordered its second service plan, 
and Mother agreed to participate in a psychological evaluation, 
a substance abuse assessment and recommended treatment, random 
urine analysis if recommended by the assessment, and monthly 
contact with the social worker by telephone, email, or in 
person.  On April 14, 2015, Mother was appointed counsel.  
  On June  18, 2015, H.D.K. was born drug- exposed,  
testing positive for methamphetamines at birth.   DHS filed a 
petition for temporary foster custody of H.D.K .  On August 31, 
2015, Mother stipulated to the court’s jurisdiction due to a *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
4 threat of harm from “inadequate housing” and agreed to court -
ordered services.  The court awarded DHS foster custody over 
H.D.K. and ordered the service plan dated August 31, 2015, which 
involved both children.
 
  Mother failed to comply with her August 31, 2015 
service plan, and a SFHR filed on December 24, 2015 documented 
that there were  unresolved safety i ssues including substance 
abuse, lack of stable housing, and  emotional and mental health 
issues.   
 
 At the hearing on December 29, 2015, DHS asked that an 
Order to Show Cause (“OSC”) hearing be set pursuant to HRS 
§ 587A-29 (2019), requiring M other to present evidence as to why 
the case should not be set for a termination of parental rights 
or legal guardianship hearing.   The court found “in favor of the 
department that this case should go into permanency” because 
“mother has not met the burden [.]” 
  On August 11, 2017, DHS filed its Motion to Establish 
a Permanent Plan (“MEPP”).   Mother contested the MEPP, and a 
trial was scheduled for October 20, 2017.   The MEPP’s stated 
goal was to terminate Mother’s parent al rights, have DHS be 
nominated as permanent custodian, and have  the children adopted 
under HRS § 587A-33 (2016).  The hearing on the MEPP took place 
on October 20, 2017 and January 5, 2018.  On January 31, 2018, 
the family court issued its Order Re:  Permanent Plans.  The *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
5 court found that Mother “has consistently failed to comply with 
service plans” and that the “ adoption of both children, each to 
different adoptive parents and homes”3 is “in the best interests 
of each minor.”  The court ordered the Permanent Plan for both 
children and ordered the placement for each child with the 
adoptive parents, directing DHS to file its motion to terminate 
parental rights within 60 days.  DH S filed a Motion to Terminate 
Parental Rights (“MTPR”) on July 6, 2018 . 
On September 21, 2018, the family court issued its 
Order Terminating Parental Rights,  finding by clear and 
convincing evidence that Mother was  not presently willing and 
able to provide the children with a safe family home, even with 
the assistance of a service plan.  The family court also found 
the proposed Permanent Plan to be in the best interests of the 
children.  The court granted DHS’s MTPR, terminated Mother’s 
parental rights, awarded permanent custody of the children to 
DHS, and approved the P ermanent Plan dated July 6, 2018. 
On October 8, 2018, Mother appealed to the ICA.  
Relevant to this appeal, Mother argued  that the family court 
abused its discretion when it only appointed her counsel ninety-
seven days after her older child was placed  in foster custody.  
                     
3  The court noted that although “in sep arate homes, the children 
spend a considerable amount of time visiting with each other while in the 
current placement.”  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
6 Mother stated that this  court held in In re T.M . that a family 
court must appoint counsel for indigent parents when a petition 
for temporary foster custody is granted.    
   The ICA filed a Summary Disposition Order (“SDO”) on 
April 6, 2020, affirming the f amily court’s Se ptember 21, 2018 
Order Terminating Parental Rights.   The ICA held that although 
the family court erred by failing to appoint counsel for Mother 
until ninety-seven days after L.I. was placed in foster custody, 
the error was harmless because Mother suffered 
no prejudice or 
harm as a result.  Quoting In re T.M. , the ICA noted that “the 
Hawai‘i Supreme Court clearly held that ‘trial courts must 
appoint counsel for indigent parents upon the granting of a 
petition to DHS for temporary foster custody of their 
children.’”  131 Hawai ʻi at 436, 319 P.3d at 355.   However, the 
ICA explained that “under the circumstances of this case, we are 
reluctant to vacate the Termination Order on this ground.”   The 
ICA observed that although the “delay of three months was 
impermissible,” Mother’s “early departure from the courtroom on 
January 13, 2015, her failure to provide DHS a specific street 
address for her new residence, and her inconsistent responses to 
voicemail messages and instructions for completing the paperwork *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
7 necessary to establish her indigency all contributed greatly to 
the delay.”4  
  Mother filed an application for writ of certiorari to 
review 
the ICA’s decision on June 12, 2020.   In Mother’s  
application, she presents two questions related to the f amily 
court’s delay in appointing her counsel : 
(1) Does this Court’s ruling in In re T.M., 319 P.3d 338, 
340 (Haw. 2014), require a trial court in a child 
welfare case to appoint counsel for a parent upon the 
State’s filing of a petition seeking custody, and 
prior to the deprivation of custody?  
 
(2) Where the trial court fails to appoint counsel,  is 
that failure harmful per se such that reversal is 
required without the parent having to demonstrate 
prejudice?   
 
In addition, Mother argues that there is ambiguity “as to 
whether courts must appoint counsel upon filing of the petition 
or whether due process permits such appointment to be delayed 
until after a court grants foster custody of the children to the 
State.”
  Mother observes that In re T.M. created ambiguity 
because it gives conflicting guidance as to when counsel must be 
appointed:   
It stated that “from and after the filing date of this 
opinion, courts must appoint counsel for indigent parents 
once DHS files a petition to assert foster custody over a 
child.” . . . .  However, the Court also stated later in 
the opinion that “upon the filing date of this opinion, 
                     
4  At the January 13, 2015  periodic review hearing , the family court 
noted that there were continuing concerns regarding Mother’s abil ity to care 
for L.I., and DHS sought  foster custody.  After the family court granted 
foster custody over L.I. to DHS, Mother left the room  prior to the hearing’s 
conclusion
. 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
8 trial courts must appoint counsel for indigent parents upon 
the granting of a petition  to DHS for temporary foster 
custody of their children. ”   
 
III.  STANDARD  OF REVIEW  
A. Constitutional Law  
  “We answer questions of constitutional law by 
exercising our own independent constitutional judgment based on 
the facts of the case.  Thus, we review questions of 
constitutional law under the right/wrong standard.”  State v. 
Ui, 142 Hawaiʻ i
 287, 292, 418 P.3d 628, 633 (2018).  
IV.  DISCUSSION 
A. In re T.M.  requires counsel to be appointed at the time DHS 
files a petition for family supervision or a petition 
asserting custody over the child. 
  In In re T.M., the petitioner appealed from an order 
granting temporary foster custody of her children to DHS because 
she was not appointed counsel until nineteen  months after DHS 
filed its petition for temporary foster custody.  131 Haw
aiʻi at 
421, 319 P.3d at 340.  This court held that the family court’s 
failure to appoint counsel constituted an abuse of discretion.  
Id.  The In re T.M. court explained that, had the petitioner 
been appointed counsel sooner, she may have been able to comply 
with the terms of the family plan and provide her child with a 
safe family home, thus potentially avoiding the subsequent 
termination of her parental rights.  Id.  at 433, 319 P.3d at 
352.  The In re T.M. court concluded by holding that “parents *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
9 have a constitutional right to counsel under article I, section 
5 in parental termination proceedings and that from and after 
the filing date of this opinion, courts must appoint counsel for 
indigent parents once DHS files a petition to assert foster 
custody over a child.”  Id. at 421, 319 P.3d at 340.   
  T he In re T.M. court repeatedly explained  that counsel 
must be appointed once DHS files  a petition to assert foster 
custody.  See id. at 435, 319 P.3d at 354 (“Thus, as soon as DHS 
files a petition asserting custody over a child, parents’ rights 
are ‘substantially affected.’  At that point, an attorney is 
essential to protect an indigent parent’s liberty interest in 
the care, custody and control of his or her children.”); id. 
(“Mandating the appointment of counsel for indigent parents once 
DHS moves for custody would remove the vagaries of a case- by-
case approach.”).5  However, near the end of the opinion, the In 
re T.M. court states:  “We direct that upon the filing date of 
this opinion, trial courts must appoint counsel for indigent 
parents upon the granting of a petition to DHS for temporary 
                     
5  Furthermore, footnote 23 of the In re T.M. opinion explained  that 
indigent criminal defendants “have a right to an attorney whenever they are 
threatened by imprisonment, even if imprisonment is not subsequently 
imposed.”   Id. at 435 n.23, 319 P.3d at 354 n.23.  The court noted that  “the 
appointment of counsel is mandated because attempting to determine in advance 
of the proceedings whether legal representation would ultimately be required 
is an exercise in futility.  The safeguard for parental rights thus rests on 
the appointment of counsel at the beginning of proceedings . . . when T.M. 
was taken into custody by DHS.”  Id.  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
10 foster custody of their children.”  Id. at 436, 319 P.3d at 355 
(emphasis added). 
  We now take this opportunity to clarify that In re 
T.M. mandated that family courts appoint counsel for indigent 
parents when DHS files a petition asserting custody over a 
child.  We now further hold that family courts must appoint 
counsel for indigent parents when DHS files a petition for 
family supervision6 because, at that point, parental rights are 
substantially affected as foster custody can be ordered by the 
court at a subsequent hearing.7  See id. at 435, 319 P.3d at 354 . 
B. The failure of the family court to appoint Mother counsel 
when DHS filed a petition for family supervision  was 
structural error. 
 
  The  family court’s delay in appointing counsel  
violated the mandate in In re T.M.  that family  courts must 
                     
6  Though DHS  argues that failure to appoint Mother counsel in this 
case is permissible because of Mother’s early departure from the January 13, 
2015 hearing, DHS takes the position that, as a general proposition, counsel 
should be appointed at the time DHS files a petition for family supervision . 
 
7  A petition for family supervision  hearing as well as review  and 
return hearings implicate parental rights even if they do not directly 
address custody.  See HRS §§ 587A- 12(b) (“ If the court determines that the 
child is subject to imminent harm while in the custody of the child ’s family, 
the court shall order that a police officer immediately take the child into 
protective custody and that the department immediately assume temporary 
foster custody of the child. ”); 587A- 28(d) (“At the return hearing, the court 
shall decide . . . [w]hether the child should be placed in foster custody or 
under family supervision[.]”); 587A-28(g) (“Nothing in this section shall 
prevent the court from setting a termination of parental rights hearing at 
any time the court deems appropriate. ”); 587A-30(b)(l) (“At each periodic 
review hearing, the court shall . . . enter orders . . . [t]hat the child be 
placed in foster custody if the court finds that the child ’s remaining in the 
family home is contrary to the welfare of the child and the child ’s parents 
are not willing and able to provide a safe family home for the child, even 
with the assistance of a service plan [.]”). *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
11 appoint counsel for indigent parents when DHS files a petition 
asserting custody over a child.  The family court’ s failure to 
appoint counsel was structural error.
  
   According to Mother , In re T.M. and the principles of 
due process require a family  court to appoint counsel for a 
parent upon DHS’s filing of a petition for custody .  She notes 
that she was not appointed counsel until three months after the 
family court awarded foster care to DHS, and this delay was 
impermissible.  
Mother is correct.  In re T.M. “recognize [d] that 
parents have a substantive liberty interest in the care, 
custody, and control of their children that is protected by the 
due process clause of article I, section 5 of the Hawai ʻi 
Constitution.”  In re T.M., 131 Hawai ʻi at 421, 319 P.3d at 340 .  
Parents’ “substantive liberty interest in the care, custody, and 
control of their children” entitles indigent parents to 
appointed counsel when a petition  for family supervision or a 
petition for foster custody is filed.   This court recognized 
that “as soon as DHS  files a petition asserting custody over a 
child, parents’ rights are ‘substantially affected.’  At that 
point, an attorney is essential to protect an indigent parent’s 
liberty interest in the care, custody and control of his or her 
children.”  Id. at 435, 319 P.3d at 354.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
12  
(continued . . .)   Here, the family court’s  three-month delay in 
appointing counsel for Mother, after DHS was awarded foster 
care, is a clear violation of In re T.M.  Pursuant to the 
holding in In re T.M., the failure to appoint counsel is a 
structural error that requires vacatur of orders made after 
DHS’s filing for foster custody.  A s Mother points out, had the 
family court appropriately appointed her counsel prior to the 
January hearing, where she lost custody to DHS without the 
benefit of counsel, she 
may have been able to prevent that 
deprivation of her constitutional right.   
 The failure to timely appoint counsel is structural 
error which, under State v. Loher, requires vacatur  without the 
necessity of proving harmful error.8  140 Hawaiʻ i 205, 222, 398 
                     
8  Our decision , that failure to appoint counsel for indigent 
parents when DHS files a petition  for family supervision or a petition  
asserting custody over a child  is structural error,  is in accord with the 
holdings of many of our sister courts.   See e.g., In Interest of R.D., 277 
P.3d 889, 896 (Colo. App. 2012) (“A majority of other jurisdictions 
addressing the issue have concluded that the violation of a respondent 
parent’s statutory or constitutional right to counsel in a termination of 
parental rights hearing is either  reversible error per se or structural 
error.”); In Interest of J.B., 624 So. 2d 792, 792 (Fla.  Dist. Ct. App. 1993) 
(failure to advise parent of right to counsel at the original dependency 
adjudication proceeding, even when parent was represented by counsel at later 
proceedings, “cannot be deemed harmless error since the dependency 
adjudication was used as a basis of the adjudication of the permanent 
termination of appellant ’s parental right”); In Interest of J.M.B., 676 
S.E.2d 9, 12 (Ga. Ct. App. 2009) (“[T]he total and erroneous denial of 
appointed counsel during the termination hearing is presumptively harmful 
because it calls into question the very structural integrity of the fact -
finding process. ”); In re A.S.A., 852 P.2d 127, 129 –30 (Mont. 1993) (failure 
to appoint parent counsel until the end of the termination hearing  violates 
parent’s constitutional right to due process and termination judgment was 
reversible error); In re S.S., 90 P.3d 571, 575 –76 (Okla. Civ. App. 2004) 
(holding that when parent  is deprived of right to counsel in termination of *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
13 P.3d 794, 811 (2017).  The family court’s failure to appoint 
Mother counsel when DHS filed its petition for family 
supervision was structural error and cannot be deemed harmless.  
Thus, the ICA erred when it failed to vacate the family cour t’s 
order granting DHS foster custody and order terminating Mother’s 
parental rights. 
V.  CONCLUSION 
  For the foregoing reasons , we vacate the ICA’s  
April 13, 2020 Judgment on Appeal affirming the family court’s 
order granting DHS foster custody and subsequent order 
terminating Mother’s parental rights, and remand for further 
proceedings consistent with this opinion and considering the 
best interests of the children.
