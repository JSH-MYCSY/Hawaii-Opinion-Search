IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAIʻI 
 
 
STATE OF HAWAI ʻI, 
Respondent/Plaintiff- Appellee, 
 
vs 
 
STACY EDWARD HARDOBY, also known as STACY EDWARD CAUSEY,
Petitioner/Defendant- Appellant.   
 
 
CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
(CAAP-18-0000781 ; CASE NO. 2CPC -17-0000693(4)) 
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.) 
  
Petitioner/Defendant -Appellant Stacy Edward Hardoby 
(Hardoby) was convicted by a jury of two counts: Count 1 — first 
degree unauthorized entry into a motor vehicle;  and Count 2 —
felony abuse of a family or household member.  Both convictions 
arose from a dispute between Hardoby and his longtime girlfriend.    
The incident giving rise to Hardoby’s convictions 
occurred when Hardoby’s girlfriend was seated in her parked car 
and Hardoby reached through the open window to strangle her with  
 
*** NOT F OR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
2 his hands.  At the trial, Hardoby requested  a merger instruction 
and a special interrogatory on the issue of merger of offenses, 
but the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (circuit court) 
concluded that the offenses did not merge and denied his request .   
Hardoby appealed his conviction to the Intermediate 
Court of Appeals (ICA) and argued that the circuit court erred 
by not providing the jury with a merger instruction because the
offenses that he was charged with arose from the same factual 
circumstances and were part of a continuing course of conduct. 
The ICA reasoned that because Hardoby could have committed the 
offenses separately, the offenses did not merge.  The ICA  
entered a Summary Disposition Order (SDO) affirming the circuit
court’s judgment.  
 
 
Hardoby timely filed a motion for reconsideration to 
the ICA based on this court’s decision in State v. Lavoie, 145 
Hawaiʻi 409, 432-
33, 453 P.3d 229, 252-53 (2019), which was 
issued the same day as the ICA’s SDO in Hardoby’s case .  Hardoby
argued that, in Lavoie, this court rejected an analysis that was
similar to the ICA’s analysis in his case and reaffirmed the 
rule that a defendant has a constitutional right to have the 
merger question determined by a jury.  However, the ICA denied 
Hardoby’s motion and entered i ts judgment on appeal.     
 
In his application for writ of certiorari, Hardoby   
 
*** NOT F OR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
3 argues that the circuit court erred in refusing to give the jury
a merger instruction and that the only remedy for this error is 
to vacate both of his convictions and remand for a new jury 
trial.  
Pursuant to Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§ 701-109(1)(e) (2014),1 a defendant cannot be convicted of more
than one offense if the offense is continuous and the 
defendant’s course of conduct was uninterrupted.  As we stat
ed 
in Lavoie, 145 Hawai ʻi at 432, 453 P.3d at 252 , “the jury is 
tasked with making the factual determination of whether two 
offenses merged.”  Thus, the circuit court erred by failing to 
instruct the jury to determine whether Hardoby had “one 
intention, one general impulse, and one plan to commit both 
offenses.”  See id. at 433, 453 P.3d at 253.  Consequently, the
ICA erred both by 
affirming the circuit court’s judgment and by 
 
 
                                                 
1 HRS § 701- 109(1)(e) provides in relevant part,  
 
Method of prosecution when conduct establishes an 
element of more than one offense. (1) When the same conduct 
of a defendant may establish an element of more than one 
offense, the defendant may be prosecuted for each offense 
of which such conduct is an element.  The defendant may not, 
however, be convicted of more than one offense if : 
 
. . . . 
 
(e) The offense is defined as a continuing course 
of conduct and the defendant’s course of 
conduct was uninterrupted, unless the law 
provides that specific periods of conduct 
constitute separate offenses.  
 
(Emphasis added.)  
 
*** NOT F OR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
4 denying Hardoby’s motion for reconsideration in light of Lavoie.    
However, Hardoby is incorrect that the only available 
remedy for the error is to vacate both of his convictions and 
remand for a new trial.  The erroneous omission  of the merger 
instruction does not change the fact that the jury found that 
Respondent/Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai
ʻi (the State) proved
both counts.  Pursuant to HRS § 701-109(1), the State could 
prosecute Hardoby for each count — the merger error merely 
precludes the entry of judgment of conviction on both counts.  
Therefore, t he remedy for the circuit court’s  error is to remand
to the circuit court and allow the State the option to dismiss 
one of the two counts and maintain the judgment of conviction 
and sentence on the other, or, to retry Hardoby on both counts 
with a merger instruction.    
 
Accordingly, we vacate the ICA’s  December 18, 2019 
Judgment on Appeal and remand to the circuit court for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.   
I.  BACKGROUND  
On September 7, 2017, the State charged Hardoby by 
information and complaint with one count of first degree 
unauthorized entry into a motor vehicle (UEMV), in violation of  
 
*** NOT F OR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
5 HRS § 708-836.5 (2014)  and one count of felony abuse of a family
or household member (felony abuse), in violation of HRS 
§ 709-906(1) and/or (8) (2014).   The charges  arose from an 
incident that occurred on September 5, 2017, when Hardoby 
allegedly reached into the driver’s side window of his 
girlfriend’s parked car and choked her with his hands.  4 32  
                                                 
2 HRS § 708- 836.5 (2014) provides in relevant part:  
 
Unauthorized entry into motor vehicle in the first 
degree. (1) A person commits the offense of unauthorized 
entry into motor vehicle in the first degree if the person 
intentionally or knowingly enters or remains unlawfully in 
a motor vehicle, without being invited, licensed, or 
otherwise authorized to enter or remain within the vehicle,
with the intent to commit a crime against a person or 
against property rights.   
 
(2) Unauthorized entry into motor vehicle in the
first degree is a class C felony.   
 
3 HRS § 709- 906 (2014) provides in relevant part:  
 
Abuse of family or household members; penalty.  (1) It 
shall be unlawful for any person . . . to physically abuse 
a family or household member[.]  
For the purposes of this section, “family or 
household member” means spouses . . . persons in a dating 
relationship . . . persons who have a child in  common[.]  
 
. . . . 
 
(8) Where the physical abuse consists of 
intentionally or knowingly impeding the normal breathing or 
circulation of the blood of the family or household member 
by applying pressure on the throat or the neck, abuse of a 
family or household member is a class C felony.  
 
4 Hardoby was also charged with assault in the third degree, but that
count was dismissed with prejudice and never presented to the jury.

6 A. Circuit Court Proceedings  
  At Hardoby’s trial,  the jury heard testimony from the 
complaining witness (the CW), who was Hardoby’s former 
girlfriend of eight years and the mother of his child.   As 
relevant here, the CW testified that the incident occurred while 
she was sitting in the driver’s seat of her parked car and 
having a heated discussion with Hardoby, who was standing 
outside of the car and near her open door.   The CW shut her car 
door and told Hardoby that she would talk to him later.  Hardoby 
reached into the car through the open driver’s side window and 
started to choke the CW using his  body and arms, putting her 
into a headlock.  Then, Hardoby started to choke the CW’s  neck 
with his left hand, which lasted between ten and fifteen seconds.
Finally, Hardoby punched the CW on the left side of her face and 
left the parking lot. 5
  
During the settlement of jury instructions, Hardoby 
requested a merger instruction and filed a proposed jury 
instruction and special interrogatory on the issue of merger of 
offenses.  The requested jury instruction provided that Hardoby 
could only be convicted of both offenses if the prosecution 
proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Hardoby (1) “ did not 
commit the offense of Unauthorized Entry into a Motor Vehicle in  
                                                 
5 The Honorable Richard T. Bissen, Jr. presided.   
 
*** NOT F OR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
7 the First Degree in Count 1 and Abuse of [ a] Family [ or] 
Household Member in Count 2 as part of a continuing and 
uninterrupted course of conduct [;]” and (2) “ committed the 
offense of Unauthorized Entry into a Motor Vehicle in the First 
Degree in Count 1 and Abuse of a Family [ or] Household Member in
Count 2 with separate and distinct intents, rather than acting 
with one intention, one general impulse, and one plan to commit 
both offenses[.]”  
The State opposed the instruction, arguing that the 
offenses did not merge because Hardoby could have committed the
UEMV offense without actually committing felony abuse, so long 
as Hardoby intended to commit a crime.   Hardoby disagreed, 
arguing that a merger instruction was appropriate because 
Hardoby’s actions consisted of a continuous course of conduct 
with one intent.  The circuit court agreed with the State that
 
the offenses did not merge because each has “separate” and 
“[d]istinct elements” that “exist in one and not in the other.”
Consequently, the circuit court denied Hardoby’s request for a 
merger instruction and a special interrogatory.  
  
The jury found Hardoby guilty of both counts.  The 
circuit court sentenced Hardoby to concurrent terms of four 
years’ probation for the UEMV count and five years’ probation 
for the felony abuse count.  The circuit court also ordered that  
 
*** NOT F OR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
8 Hardoby serve one year in jail as a condition of his probation.  
B. ICA Proceedings  
Hardoby appealed to the ICA.  On appeal, Hardoby 
argued that the circuit court erred by refusing to instruct the
jury on the law of merger and that, pursuant to 
HRS § 701-109(1)(e) (2014),  he could not be convicted of both 
UEMV and felony abuse if his actions in committing the offenses
were “simultaneous and part of a continuing course of conduct.”
Hardoby further argued that whether his offenses were part of a
continuing course of conduct was  a question for the jury to 
decide.  Accordingly,  Hardoby maintained that the circuit 
court’s jury instructions were erroneous  and that the proper 
remedy was for the case to be remanded for a new trial on both 
counts. 6 
 
  
 
The ICA affirmed the circuit court’s j udgment of 
conviction and held that the circuit court did not err in 
refusing to give the requested jury instruction and 
interrogatory.  The ICA cited State v. Hoopii, 68 Haw. 246, 
251, 
710 P.2d 1193, 1197 (1985), where this court rejected a claim 
that the offense of kidnapping merged with the offenses of rape 
and sodomy and held that kidnapping was still a separate offense.
The ICA noted that in Hardoby’s case, the circuit court engaged    
                                                 
6 See supra note 1 for the relevant  text of HRS § 701- 109(1)(e) .  
 
*** NOT F OR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
9 in an analysis similar to the Hoopii  court when it reasoned that
the offenses of UEMV and felony abuse have separate elements 
“that exist in one and not in the other.”  The ICA similarly 
reasoned that Hardoby did not need to strangle
 the CW to be 
convicted of UEMV or to have entered 
the CW’s vehicle to be 
convicted of felony abuse.  Thus, the ICA concluded that the 
offenses did not merge and the circuit court did not err in 
refusing to give the requested jury instruction and 
interrogatory.  
Hardoby timely filed a motion for reconsideration.  In 
his motion, Hardoby argued that it was for the jury to determine 
whether the UEMV and felony abuse offenses merged.  Hardoby 
cited this court’s decision in Lavoie, 145 Hawai ʻi 
at 432-33, 453 
P.3d at 252- 53, issued the same day as the ICA’s SDO in 
Hardoby’s case, which  reaffirmed the rule that a defendant has a 
constitutional right to have the merger question determined by a 
jury.  Hardoby argued that, in Lavoie, this court rejected an 
analysis that w as similar to the ICA’s analysis in this case , 
noting that “[t] rial courts are not tasked with making factual 
findings regarding when each offense occurred or whether the 
defendant’s conduct constitutes an uninterrupted continuous 
course of conduct; the jury makes such determinations.  Id. at 
433, 453 P.3d at 253).  
 
*** NOT F OR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
10  
The ICA denied Hardoby’s motion  because it concluded
that “Hardoby has not presented any points of law or fact the 
court has overlooked or misapprehended.”   See Hawaiʻi Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP ) Rule 40(b) (2000) (provid ing that a
motion for reconsideration “shall state with particularity the
points of law or fact that the moving party contends the court
has overlooked or misapprehended”) .  On December 18, 2019, the
ICA entered its judgment on appeal.  
 
 
 
 
II.  STANDARDS OF REVIEW  
A. Conclusions of Law 
Conclusions of law are reviewed de novo under the 
right/wrong standard of review.  Maria v. Freitas, 73 Haw. 266,
270, 832 P.2d 259, 262 (1992).  
B. Jury Instructions  
The propriety of jury instructions is a question of 
law reviewed de novo using the following standard: whether, 
“when read and considered as a whole, the instructions given are
prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, or 
misleading.”  State v. Bovee, 139 Hawai ʻi 530, 537, 394 P.3d 760,
767 (2017) (quoting State v. Frisbee, 114 Hawaiʻi 76, 79, 156 
P.3d 1182, 1185 (2007)).  
 
  
 
*** NOT F OR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
11 III.  DISCUSSION 
Hardoby argues that because UEMV can “encompass  a 
continuing course of conduct[,] ” he cannot be convicted of both
UEMV and felony abuse unless the trier of fact determines that 
the offenses were not part of a continuous course of conduct.  
For that reason, Hardoby maintains that the ICA erred by 
concluding that a merger instruction was not required.  
We have previously addressed this precise issue:  
 Generally, “[w]hen the same conduct of a defendant 
may establish an element of more than one offense, the 
defendant may be prosecuted for each offense of which such 
conduct is an element.”  HRS § 701 -109(1) (2014).  A 
“defendant may not, however, be convicted of more than one 
offense if ...
 [t]he offense is defined as a continuing 
course of conduct and the defendant’s course of conduct was 
uninterrupted, unless the law provides that specific 
periods of conduct const itute separate offenses.”  HRS 
§ 701-109(1)(e).  Thus, this court has concluded that only 
one crime is committed when “(1) there is but one intention,
one general impulse, and one plan, (2) the two offenses are 
part and parcel of a continuing and uninterrupted course of 
conduct, and (3) the law does not provide that specific 
periods of conduct constitute separate offenses.”  State v. 
Hoey, 77 Hawai ʻi 17, 38, 881 P.2d 504, 525 (1994).   
 
Lavoie, 145 Hawai ʻi at 431, 453 P.
3d at 251 (emphasis added).  
The factual determination of whether a defendant acted with “one 
intention, one general impulse, and one plan” must be made by 
the trier of fact.  Id.  at 433, 453 P.3d at 252 (quoting State v.
Matias, 102 Hawaiʻ i 300, 305, 75 P .3d 1191, 1196 (2003)); accord 
Hoey, 77 Hawaiʻ i at 38, 881 P.2d at  525.  Thus, Hardoby may not 
be convicted of more than one offense if: (1) either of the 
offenses he was charged with are defined as a continuing course   
 
*** NOT F OR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
12 of conduct; and (2) his course of conduct was continuing and 
uninterrupted; (3) so long as the statute does not provide that
specific periods of conduct constitute separate offenses.  See  
Lavoie, 145 Hawaiʻ i at 431, 453 P.3d at 251.   
A threshold issue is whether either of the offenses 
Hardoby was charged with “is defined as a continuing course of 
conduct[.]”  See HRS § 701-109(1)(e).   “Whether a particular 
criminal offense can be charged as a continuous offense is a 
question of law.”  Lavoie, 145 Hawaiʻ i at 431, 453 P.3d at 251. 
“The test for whether a crime can be charged as a continuous 
offense is whether the statute precludes charging an offense as
a continuous offense, and whether the element(s) of the offense
may constitute a continuous, unlawful ac t or series of acts[.]”
Id.   7
 
 
 
  
Here, Hardoby was charged with UEMV and the  language 
of the statute does not preclude UEMV from being charged as a 
continuous crime.  A person commits the offense of UEMV if he 
“intentionally or knowingly enters or remains un lawfully in a 
motor vehicle, without being . . . authorized to enter or remain
within the vehicle, with the intent to commit a crime against a 
person or against property rights.”  HRS §  708-836.5(1) 
(emphasis added).  Thus, the language of HRS § 708-836.5(1)  
                                                 
7 See supra note 1 for the relevant text of HRS § 701 -109(1)(e).   
 
*** NOT F OR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
13 criminalizes a range of conduct that spans from a brief,  
unauthorized entry into a vehicle to remaining in the vehicle 
over a longer period of time.  See  State v. Faria, 100 Hawaiʻi 
383, 389, 60 P.3d 333, 339 (2002) (holding that “for purposes of 
the UEMV statute, ‘entry’ is defined as the least intrusion into 
a motor vehicle with the whole physical body, with any part of 
the body, or with any instrument appurtenant to the body 
introduced for the purpose of committing a crime against a 
person 
or against property rights .”) (footnote omitted); State v.
Lagat, 97 Hawaiʻ i 492, 502, 40 P.3d 894, 904 (2002) (observing 
that a person who breaks into a camper seeking shelter may be 
charged wit
h UEMV).  Not only does the statute’s plain language 
not preclude charging it as a continuing offense, the statute 
actually criminalizes the continuing conduct of “ remain[ing] 
unlawfully in a motor vehicle.”  HRS §  708-836.5(1) (emphasis 
added).   
Thus, the offense of UEMV meets  the test for a crime
that can be charged as a continuous offense because (1) HRS 
§ 708-836.5 does not preclude charging it as a continuous 
offense; and (2) the elements of the offense — remaining 
unlawfully in a motor vehicle — “may constitute a continuous,   
 
*** NOT F OR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
14 unlawful act or series of acts[.]”   See Lavoie, 145 Hawai ʻi at
431, 453 P.3d at 251.  8  
Both the UEMV and felony abuse charges arose from the 
same altercation between Hardoby and the CW.  Whether Hardoby’s 
conduct constituted “‘separate and distinct culpable acts or an 
uninterrupted continuous course of conduct ’ was a question of 
fact that was required to be determined by the jury. ”  See id. 
at 433, 453 P.3d at 253 (quoting Matias, 102 Hawai ʻi at 306, 75 
P.3d at 1197).  Accordingly, because the offense of UEMV can be 
charged as a continuous offense, it was
 for the jury — and not 
the circuit court — to determine whether Hardoby had “one 
intention, one general impuls e, and one plan,” and whether UEMV  
merged with the offense of felony abuse.  See id. at 431, 453 
P.3d at 251 (quoting Matias, 102 Hawaiʻi at 305, 75 P.3d at 1196).
See also Hoey, 77 Hawaiʻi at 38, 881 P.2d at 525 (holding that 
“the question whether [the defendant]’s kidnapping offense   
                                                 
8 Moreover, the Legislature’s purpose in enacting the UEMV statute also 
supports our determination that UEMV can be charged as a continuous offense. 
See State v. Decoite, 132 Hawaiʻi 436, 438, 323 P.3d 80, 82 (2014) (“The test 
to determine whether a crime may be charged on a continuous conduct theory is 
whether the language, structure, and purpose of the statute reveals a 
legislative intent to criminalize continui ng conduct.”).  According to the 
commentary to HRS § 708 -836.5, the Legislature added this section to the 
Hawaiʻi Penal Code “due to the increased number of car thefts in the State.”  
Thus, the Legislature’s decision to criminalize “remain[ing] unlawfully in a 
motor vehicle” indicates that the Legislature explicitly considered that UEMV 
could be charged as a continuing course of conduct and intended that it would 
be a continuous offense in order to reduce the number of auto thefts.  
See 
HRS § 708-836.5(1).

15 merged into the robbery offense . . . is one of fact that should 
have been submitted to the jury. ”) (citation and footnote 
omitted). 
“The circuit court has the duty and ultimate 
responsibility to instruct the jury on the proper and relevant 
law.”  Lavoie, 145 Hawaiʻi at 433, 453 P.3d at 253 (citation 
omitted).  Because the determination of whether the 
UEMV and 
felony abuse offenses merged was a question of fact for the jury 
to decide, the circuit court erred by refusing to provide a 
merger instruction and the error was prejudicial
.  See id.  
(holding that the trial court’s failure to instruct the jury on 
the law of merger was prejudicial).  Similarly, the ICA erred in 
affirming the circuit court and holding that no merger 
instruction was required.  9
Next, we address Hardoby’s claim that the proper 
remedy for the merger violation in his case is to remand to the 
circuit court for a new trial to allow the jury to determine 
whether the charged offenses merge.  In State v. Padilla, the 
ICA held that the trial court committed plain error by failing 
                                                 
9  Additionally, the ICA erred by denying Hardoby’s Motion for 
Reconsideration.  While the ICA did not have the benefit of this cou rt’s 
Lavoie decision when it entered its SDO, Hardoby did  bring it to the ICA’s 
attention in his Motion for Reconsideration  and provided a copy of  it to the 
ICA as an exhibit.  Thus, the ICA erred by concluding that Hardoby “has not 
provided any points of law or fact the court has overlooked or 
misapprehended[]” and denying Hardoby’s Motion for  Reconsideration .  
 
*** NOT F OR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
16 to give a merger instruction in regards to firearms charges of 
felon-in-possession and place-to-keep.  114 Hawaiʻ i 507, 517, 164 
P.3d 765, 775 (App. 2007).  The State argued that even if the 
trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury on the law of 
merger, “a new trial is not necessary because the State could 
obviate the error by dismissing either [of the two counts].”  Id.
The ICA agreed and remanded to the trial court, giving the State 
the option of either dismissing one count and retaining the 
judgment of conviction and sentence on the non- dismissed count, 
or, retrying the defendant on both counts “with an appropriate 
merger instruction.”  Id. at 518, 164 P.3d at 776.     
According to Hardoby, the remedy of allowing the State
to dismiss one of the two charges and maintain the judgment of 
conviction and sentence on the other is only available if the 
State concedes the merger instruction error and requests to 
dismiss one of the counts.  10 
Hardoby is incorrect that the only remedy available in 
this case is a new trial.  Contrary to Hardoby’s argument, the 
ICA’s remedy in Padilla springs from the text of HRS 
§ 701-109(1)(e)
, and not from the State’ s willingness to concede 
                                                 
10 In its response to Hardoby’s application for writ of certiorari, the 
State maintains that the circuit court did not err by failing to provide a 
merger instruction, but requests that if this court disagrees, the State  be 
permitted to dismiss one of the counts and maintain the judgment of 
conviction on the other .

17 the error on appeal.  See id. at 517, 164 P.3d at 775.  T he ICA 
considered the plain language of HRS § 701- 109(1)(e) which “only 
prohibits conviction for two offenses if the offenses merge; it 
specifically permits prosecution on both offenses.”  Id.  The 
ICA also reasoned that this court had followed a similar 
approach in analogous situations.  Id.  (citing Garringer v.

v. Vanstory, 91 Hawai ʻi 33, 48–49, 979 P.2d 1059, 1074 –75 (1999), 
superseded by statute on other grounds (remedying a merger 
violation by reversing the defendant’s conviction for a lesser 
included offense and affirming the defendant’s other 
conviction)). 
We agree with the ICA’s reasoning in Padilla.  
HRS § 701- 109(1)(e) permits the State to prosecute Hardoby for 
both UEMV and felony abuse, but if his course of conduct was 
continuous and uninterrupted, Hardoby may only be convicted for
one of those offenses.  Here, the jury found Hardoby guilty 
beyond a reasonable doubt of both charges.  Accordingly, on 
remand we afford the State the option of either dismissing one 
of the two charges and maintaining the judgment of conviction

and sentence on the non-dismissed count, or, retrying Hardoby on
both counts with an appropriate merger instruction.    
IV.  CONCLUSION 
Accordingly, the ICA ’s December 18, 2019 Judgment on 
Appeal is vacated and this case is remanded to the circuit court 
for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
