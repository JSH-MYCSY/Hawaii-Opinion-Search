OPINION OF THE COURT BY EDDINS, J. 
 
I.  
 In this divorce case, the Family Court of the Second 
Circuit ordered a default judgment in favor of Joel D. Katz 
(Husband) as a Hawaiʻ i Family Court Rules (HFCR) Rule 37(b)(2) 
discovery sanction against Dania N. Katz (Wife).  Later, the Electronically Filed

 2 court refused to set aside the default, and then denied Wife’s 
motion to reconsider.  
 
In a memorandum opinion with a dissent, the Intermediate 
Court of Appeals affirmed the family court.    We conclude that the family court erred when it declined to 
set aside the default judgment under HFCR Rule 60(b)(1) for 
excusable neglect.  The court also erred by entering default as 
a discovery sanction.  
We vacate the family court’s orders and remand to the 
second circuit. 
II.  
Husband and Wife married in 1995.  Husband filed for 
divorce in October 2016.  Husband works as a musician, teaches 
at the University of Hawaiʻ i Maui College, and earns income 
through his home studio recording business.  Wife owns and runs 
a Maui food and drink publication.  They have two children.  One 
child, their daughter, was a minor (sixteen years old) when 
Husband filed for divorce.  
Initially, Wife had an attorney, who helped her answer 
Husband’s divorce complaint.  On January 24, 2017, Husband served a production of documents request on Wife’s attorney.  
Husband demanded that Wife produce varied records within a 
month.  His document request spanned seven pages, containing 
several subparts.  Husband wanted copies of each check and wire *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 3 payment Wife received and made after their 1995 marriage.  He 
also 
sought other financial records, like Wife’s credit card 
statements from the past three years, all her personal financial statements and complete business records covering the past five 
years, all cash and non-cash gifts from the last five years 
exceeding $1,000, and any document showing Wife had sole or 
joint ownership of any asset during their marriage.  
The discovery deadline lapsed with no response from Wife.  
After the deadline passed, Husband’s attorney called Wife’s attorney.  Wife’s attorney said she would move to withdraw as 
counsel.  On March 1, 2017, she did.  And on March 17, 2017, the 
court granted the motion.  Before withdrawing, Wife’s lawyer did 
not request a discovery extension.   
The family court did not schedule a status hearing 
regarding new counsel, or any court date.  The record omits a 
transcript.  No one suggests that the family court advised Wife 
about her court-related responsibilities 
On April 5, Husband sent his attorney an email.  He decides 
to “switch” to Wife’s tax accountant because Wife told him she had filed a separate tax return.  Husband mentions that he had 
asked Wife’s accountant for her 2016 tax information.  The 
accountant, Husband tells his attorney, “did not have any 
numbers from her to complete a return and he was unable to *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 4 advise [Husband] on whether it would be to [Husband’s and 
Wife’s]
 benefit to file jointly.” 
On April 6 at 5:08 a.m., Husband’s attorney emailed Wife.  
The attorney asks her to confirm what Husband claimed: Wife had 
filed her 2016 tax returns and listed their daughter as a 
dependent.  Counsel comments that if Wife has already filed her 
tax returns, she could easily produce the discovery materials.  
But if she hasn’t filed, the attorney wants to “speak with [Wife] about the efficacy of filing a joint return.” 
One minute later, Husband’s lawyer sent a second email.  
The lawyer warns Wife that Husband would move to compel 
discovery and seek attorney’s fees and costs if Wife doesn’t 
produce the records by April 11. 
Wife replied on April 12.  Husband gave her more time to 
respond, she says.  (Husband denies this.)  In her email, Wife 
informs Husband’s counsel that she was still unrepresented.  
Finding a new attorney posed challenges, she explains; many Maui attorneys had declined to represent her due to “conflict of 
interest.”  Later in her motion to set aside the default 
judgment, Wife elaborates: (1) Husband communicated with several 
Maui family law attorneys before she did; and (2) other lawyers 
declined to represent her because they had pending cases before 
a per diem family court judge who Husband was dating.  Wife’s 
financial situation also made hiring a lawyer difficult. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 5 Aside from lack of counsel, Wife offers another reason why 
she 
struggled to produce the records.  She needed a new 
accountant.  Once the accountant realized he had shared her 
confidential information with Husband, she says, the accountant 
sent each a letter, refusing to work with either spouse.  Wife 
maintains Husband’s “interference” made her unable to “furnish 
[Husband] with accurate financial records from [her] 
[accountant].” 
Husband counters that the accountant told him he had “no 
conflict working with [Husband] or [Wife]” and discussed their filing of joint returns.  But soon after, the accountant sent 
Husband and Wife letters, advising that he did in fact have 
“conflicts of interest.”  Husband blames Wife for the 
accountant’s decision.  He speculates she had “some intense 
contact” with the accountant making him “change his mind about 
working with us.” 
On May 4, Husband moves to compel discovery.  Husband asks 
for attorney’s fees and costs and lists all available discovery sanctions under HFCR Rule 37(b)(2), including entering default 
judgment.  A “Notice of Motion” dated May 2, 2017 and signed by 
Counsel, says that the family court would hear the discovery 
motion on May 31, 2017.  A certificate of service, also dated 
May 2, 2017, represents that Counsel had served Wife by mail at 
her P.O. Box. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 6 Meanwhile, Wife and her daughter planned to move out of the 
longtime 
family home at the end of May.  On May 31, 2017, Wife 
is a no-show at the motion to compel discovery hearing.  Since 
she neither appeared nor provided discovery, Husband orally 
moves to default Wife.  The court defaults her.  It grants 
Husband’s motion to compel, imposes attorney’s fees and costs, 
and gives Wife until June 13 to produce discovery.  The court 
also schedules a further hearing on the discovery matter for June 27, 2017. 
The day before that hearing, Husband moves ex parte to 
extend the discovery deadline and reset the status hearing.  
Turns out, Counsel never served Wife with the notice of hearing 
date.  Wife has “not been served with the Order relating to the 
Motion to Compel Discovery filed May 5, 2017 [sic] and heard on 
May 31, 2017[,]” Counsel writes. 
The court grants Husband’s “ex parte motion to extend 
deadlines and to continue status hearing.”  It signs a proposed order submitted with, and attached to, the motion.  Wife is 
given about two weeks, until July 10, to produce discovery.  The 
“Ex Parte Order” also moves the next day’s hearing to July 20, 
2017.  At the end, it cautions Wife that if she fails to appear 
at the discovery status hearing or submit discovery, “the court 
may granted [sic] the proposed Divorce Decree submitted by 
[Husband].”  As before, Husband’s counsel does not email Wife *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 7 the legal documents, personally serve her, or communicate with 
Wife
 about the court date. 
Husband’s counsel files another certificate of service.  
Counsel mails (to Wife’s P.O. Box) the court’s May 31 discovery 
order, along with other legal documents: the ex parte motion and 
order (together six pages); two copies of an odd-fonted, one 
page, unsigned and uncaptioned “order” purporting to grant 
Husband attorney’s fees and costs; and Husband’s proposed divorce decree, titled “Judgment Granting Divorce and Awarding 
Child Custody.”  
Counsel created the court’s ex parte order (and every 
family court order filed in the case).  Counsel’s name and 
office information, like a motion, appear in the top left 
corner.  At the end of each order, above a line above “Judge of 
the above-entitled court,” the family court judge signs off.   
The ex parte order – the one that reset the status hearing 
and set a discovery deadline - does not stand alone.  The two-page order follows Husband’s four-page “ex parte motion to 
extend deadlines and to continue status hearing.”  The order’s 
final part reads: “If [Wife] fails to appear at that status 
hearing mentioned above or fails to respond to the discovery 
requests by the deadline stated herein, the court may granted 
[sic] the proposed Divorce Decree submitted and filed by 
[Husband].” *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 8 On July 20, 2017, Wife does not show at the status hearing.  
Husband reports that Wife had ignored the discovery deadline.  
The family court asks: “[H]as there been any communication from 
the defendant?”  Husband’s attorney replies that Husband and 
Wife had discussed matters other than discovery or the case.  
Then, because Wife missed the status hearing and neglected her 
discovery obligations, the family court defaults her. 
Next, the court veers toward finality.  It gives Husband a 
choice.  Does he want to testify under oath or submit an affidavit regarding jurisdiction?  Husband chooses to testify.  
The court poses some jurisdictional questions about the 
marriage, then says it has “one last question” for Husband, 
reminding him that he was “still under oath.”  The court asks 
husband about his proposed division of property: “The division 
of assets, including real property, does it follow the Hawaiʻ i 
Marriage Partnership Principles?  Meaning that it’s a reasonably fair distribution of the assets of the marriage?”  See 
Hawaiʻi 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 580-47(a) (property division should be 
“just and equitable”).  Husband’s attorney jumps in, “my client 
asked me that question too.  Can I respond to that?”  Husband’s 
interest in the equity of their home equals the value of Wife’s 
business, Counsel says.  Thus, the divorce decree awards Husband 
the home (he had sole title before marriage and kept it solely in his name during marriage) and its equity over the twenty plus *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 9 years of the marriage.  And it lets Wife keep her business.  
Husband “indicated,” the lawyer says, that Wife’s business “has 
substantial cash flow.  Um, probably [$]100,000 a year in cash 
flow.” 
Then the court asks Husband if the property division is 
equitable.  Husband answers: 
[Husband:]  I - I do.  I mean I understand that [DK] is 
entitled to half the increase in equity of the house.  And 
we had an informal agreement when we were married that she 
had no interest in the property.  Although I offered her, 
you know, sharing the title.  And I paid for everything 
with the house for the en - our entire marriage.  All 
taxes, all mortgage, all repairs and maintenance. 
 
[Family Court:]  Is - is the value of her business, in your 
opinion, reasonably close to the value of the increase in 
equity, if divided by two, during the marriage?  
[Husband:]  I think it’ s close.  But I – 
 [Family Court:]  All right.  I’ m satisfied. 
 
That’s it.  Case closed.  The court enters a default 
judgment against Wife.  Husband receives all equity in the 
family’s Wailuku home.  Wife keeps her magazine business and 
receives zero spousal support.  The two share joint physical and legal custody of their daughter.  
 Husband did not submit an asset and debt statement or any 
record to support his (or Wife’s) financial circumstances.  The 
family court divides the marital property based on Husband’s and 
his counsel’s “testimony.”  Other than making Counsel cross-out 
“by agreement” language in the decree and add “pursuant to *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 10 [Wife’s] default,” the family court makes no meaningful changes 
to Husband’s hoped-for divorce decree.
  
 Wife hired an attorney.  By then, the Hawaiʻ i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure Rule 4(a)(3) deadline had passed.  So Wife 
moved to set aside the default judgment under HFCR Rule 60(b). 
A different family court judge denies Wife’s motion to set 
aside the default judgment.  The court’s pithy order reads: 
“[T]he sanction of default was within the sound discretion of 
the Court[.]”  Wife moves to reconsider.  The family court 
denies that motion, too. 
Wife appeals in October 2018. 
 In a November 2022 memorandum opinion, the ICA affirms the family court’s orders granting the default judgment, refusing to 
set it aside, and denying the recon.  The ICA holds that Wife’s 
failure to appear in court and comply with discovery did not 
constitute excusable neglect under HFCR Rule 60(b)(1).  Rule 
60(b) “is at bottom an equitable one,” the court understands.  
But equity principles do not support setting aside the default 
judgment.  The opinion ends: “Taking account of all the relevant circumstances surrounding [Wife’s] failure to meet deadlines, 
appear at hearings, and provide reliable information regarding 
the income from and value of her business, we cannot say that 
her conduct constituted excusable neglect.” *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 11  Judge Nakasone dissents.  She finds Wife’s neglect 
excusable under a “broad, equitable inquiry taking into account 
all relevant circumstances.”  These circumstances include Wife’s 
“self-represented status, the multiple ambiguities surrounding 
the adequacy of the notification that Self-Represented [Wife] 
received, her personal situation regarding the housing 
transition and working two jobs, and the financial and 
logistical challenges she encountered in finding conflict-free replacement counsel on Maui.” 
 
Wife applied for cert, and we accepted. 
III. 
Hawaiʻi Family Court Rule 60(b) and its look-alikes, Hawaiʻ i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 60(b) and Hawaiʻ i District 
Court Rules (HDCR) Rule 60(b), offer a defaulted party a way to 
attack a final judgment.  These rules allow relief “from a final 
judgment, order, or proceeding.” 
 Rule 60 is no substitute for appeal.  Once the notice of 
appeal deadline expires, the rule allows a last chance at a 
merits-based outcome.  Courts treat this challenge as a 
continuation of the original action.  PennyMac Corp. v. Godinez, 
148 Hawaiʻ i 323, 329, 474 P.3d 264, 270 (2020). 
Equity principles guide Rule 60(b) motions.  See, HFCR Rule 
60(b) (“On motion and upon such terms as are 
just . . . ”) 
(emphasis added); Eckard Brandes, Inc. v. Dep’t of Labor and *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 12 Indus. Relations, 146 Hawaiʻ i 354, 364, 463 P.3d 1101, 1021 
(2020) (the rule endorses a “broad, equitable, inquiry”); In re 
Haw. Elec. Co. Inc., 149 
Hawaiʻi 343, 362, 489 P.3d 1255, 1274 
(2021) (explaining how rule 60(b)(5) refers to “some change in 
conditions that makes continued enforcement inequitable.”).  
Equity and finality often clash.  Rule 60(b) “attempts to 
strike a proper balance between the conflicting principles that litigation must be brought to an end and that justice should be 
done.”  11 C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and 
Procedure § 2851 (3d ed. 2023).  Because Rule 60(b) is remedial 
in nature, Hawaiʻ i courts apply it liberally, favoring a merits-
oriented outcome that bends the rule’s finality interest to 
accomplish justice.  See e.g., Matsuura v. E.I. du Pont de 
Nemours & Co., 102 Hawaiʻ i 149, 158, 73 P.3d 687, 696 (2003) 
(“HRCP Rules 60(b) and 60(b)(3) reflect the preference for 
judgments on the merits over the finality of judgments.”); see 
also Magoon v. Magoon, 70 Haw. 605, 616 n.4, 780 P.2d 80, 86 n.4 
(1989) (recognizing, in a division of marital property case, 
HFCR Rule 60(b)’s “clash” between finality and justice, and 
noting “the desire for truth is deemed to outweigh the value of 
finality” with rule 60(b)(3) fraud claims); Rearden Family Tr. 
v. Wisenbaker, 101 Hawaiʻ i 237, 254, 65 P.3d 1029, 1046 (2003) 
(default judgments are “harsh” so any doubts are resolved in favor of a merits-based outcome). *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 13 A. 
 Wife argues her neglect was excusable.  She says the ICA 
erred when it affirmed the family court’s denial of her timely 
(within one year) HFCR Rule 60(b)(1) motion.  The rule reads: 
(b)   Mistakes; Inadvertence; Excusable Neglect; Newly 
Discovered Evidence; Fraud.  On motion and upon such terms 
as are just, the court may relieve a party or a party’s 
legal representative from any or all of the provisions of a 
final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons:  
(1)   mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable 
neglect[.] 
 
 A trial court does not narrowly focus on the defaulting 
party’s neglect.  Rather, it considers “all relevant 
circumstances” to see if the neglect is excusable.  Pioneer Inv. 
Servs. Co. v. Brunswick Assocs. Ltd. P’ship, 507 U.S. 380, 395 
(1993). 
 This court has identified three factors to assess Rule 
60(b) motions to set aside: (1) prejudice to the non-defaulting 
party; (2) whether the defaulting party offers a “meritorious 
defense”; and (3) whether the default resulted from “inexcusable 
neglect or a wilful act.”  BDM, Inc. v. Sageco, Inc., 57 Haw. 
73, 76, 549 P.2d 1147, 1150 (1976); cf. Chen v. Mah, 146 Hawaiʻ i 
157, 160, 457 P.3d 796, 799 (2020) (ruling that a good cause 
standard controls HRCP Rule 55 motions, but leaving untouched 
BDM’s factors for HRCP Rule 60(b) motions).  Equity principles 
inspire each factor and guide a Rule 60(b) motion’s resolution. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
14 This court has not meaningfully tended Rule 60(b)(1) since 
sketching BDM’s three factors some time ago.  Since courts 
consider all relevant circumstances, we identify three more 
factors that may aid Rule 60(b)(1)’s equitable inquiry: (1) the 
defaulting party’s good or bad faith.  See Bateman v. U.S. 
Postal Serv., 231 F.3d 1220, 1223–24 (9th Cir. 2000) (quoting 
Pioneer, 507 U.S. at 395, identifying the three BDM factors and 
a fourth - “whether the movant acted in good faith.”); (2) court 
warnings regarding default judgment as a consequence.  See, 
e.g., Guggenheim Cap., LLC v. Birnbaum, 722 F.3d 444, 452 (2d
Cir. 2013) (holding, in a case with six separate verbal
warnings, that “a court abuses its discretion if it dismisses a
case without first warning a pro se party of the consequences of
failing to comply with the court’s discovery orders”); and (3)
the effectiveness of alternative measures.  See Emcasco Ins. Co.
v. Sambrick, 834 F.2d 71, 73 (3d Cir. 1987) (using “the
effectiveness of alternative sanctions” as a factor to
“determine whether the trial court has abused its discretion in
dismissing, or refusing to lift a default.”).
We understand the first two factors may shoehorn into BDM’s 
wide-ranging third factor (inexcusable neglect or willful act).  
But we believe considering good or bad faith and court warnings 
covering consequences aid a relevant circumstances inquiry.  As 
to “alternative measures,” since a defaulting party can usually *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
15 suggest a credible lesser measure than a case’s end, this factor
is mostly unhelpful.  Its value, though, rises when a Rule 60(b)
motion follows a Rule 37-derived default judgment.  See, e.g., 
Malautea v. Suzuki Motor Co., Ltd., 987 F.2d 1536, 1542 (11th 
Cir. 1993) (calling default judgment as a Rule 37 discovery 
sanction “severe” and “appropriate only as a last resort, when 
less drastic sanctions would not ensure compliance with the 
court’s orders.”)    
B. 
First, we examine prejudice.  Did the defaulting party’s 
neglect prejudice the other side? 
We conclude Husband will suffer no prejudice if the case 
reopens.  Husband identifies none.  He doesn’t explain how 
setting aside the default causes prejudicial harm to his case. 
Nor does he point to common signs of prejudice, like lost 
evidence or unavailable witnesses.  See, e.g., KPS & Assocs., 
Inc. v. Designs By FMC, Inc., 318 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir. 2003) 
(describing the loss of evidence due to delay as an example of unfair prejudice). 
Husband says that Wife’s failure to provide financial 
records prejudiced him.  A trial date, though, had not yet been 
set when the court defaulted Wife.  And even if one loomed, that 
was then, prejudice under Rule 60(b) is now.  Husband does not 
claim prospective prejudice.
  That is, if the court grants the *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 16 motion to set aside and the case reopens, will prejudice result?  
There is no prejudice to Husband if the family court decides 
property division and child custody based on evidence presented 
at trial.  Having his case decided on the merits versus a 
forfeit win disadvantages Husband, but it does not prejudice 
him.  BDM, 57 Haw. at 76, 549 P.2d at 1150 (reasoning the “mere 
fact” a party has to litigate doesn’t spell prejudice). 
We turn to the meritorious defense factor. 
A meritorious defense does not mean a triumphant defense; 
it’s closer to a valiant defense.  A favorable outcome is not something the defaulting party needs to show.  Rather, the Rule 
60(b) movant only needs to present some factual support - bare 
allegations will not do - that paves the way to a different 
outcome.  “All that is necessary to satisfy the meritorious 
defense requirement is to allege sufficient facts that, if true, 
would constitute a defense” to the underlying matter.  United 
States v. Aguilar, 782 F.3d 1101, 1107 (9th Cir. 2015) (cleaned 
up). 
Wife claims that Husband inaccurately represented their 
financial situation.  She says he controlled the finances during their marriage, and they were not the financial equals he paints 
through his in-court testimony and his divorce decree (later 
adopted nearly word-for-word by the family court).  Wife 
maintains she lacked legal representation and awareness of her *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 17 legal plight, causing an inequitable outcome: “It awards all 
family assets solely to [Husband].”
 
After Wife retained new counsel, she filed her motion to 
set aside.  In it, Wife offers evidence that establishes 
sufficient facts to support a worthwhile defense contesting the 
division of the marital property.  For instance, Wife presents 
evidence that (1) per her 2017 tax return, the magazine business 
made a gross profit of less than $25,000; (2) Husband, in his words, believed the magazine was “not a viable source of income 
for [Wife]” and that “[a]ny financial hardship [Wife] alleges is 
due to her own irresponsibility and poor choices”; (3) values 
the family home at $679,000 in July 2017 (this appraisal, 
though, does not show the property’s equity increase over the 
twenty-year marriage); (4) puts her in the hole $450 per month 
(per her income and expense statement, HFCR Form 2F-E-035 – a 
document Husband never filed), unable to cover her and her 
daughter’s living expenses, even after taking a second job; and (5) post-mother-and-daughter move-out, Husband receives 
substantial rental income. 
We conclude that Wife presents sufficient factual support 
to contest the property division proposed in Husband’s divorce 
decree.  
Now, we look at Wife’s neglect. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
18 Inexcusable neglect may sink a Rule 60(b) motion.  But 
neglect or carelessness may not.  “[N]egligence or carelessness 
does not prevent a court in equity from discretion to relieve a 
litigant from an adverse judgment.”  In re Marriage of Gharst, 
525 P.3d 250, 254 (Wash. Ct. App. 2023); see Bateman, 231 F.3d 
at 1225 (finding excusable neglect since the “errors resulted 
from negligence and carelessness, not from deviousness or 
willfulness.”); Pioneer, 507 U.S. at 395 (considering “whether 
the movant acted in good faith.”). 
Wife offers several reasons for her neglect: she (1) lacked 
legal representation and scrambled to find an affordable lawyer 
who wasn’t conflicted by Husband’s actions or his personal 
relationship with a per diem judge; (2) moved out of the 
longtime family home with her teenage daughter right before a 
court hearing; (3) struggled to make ends meet; (4) received 
confusing court documents and was not adequately warned about 
default judgment as a discovery sanction; and (5) realized too late that the court adopted Husband’s divorce decree based on 
his in-court testimony during a status hearing that morphed into 
a trial. 
The ICA majority deflates Wife’s excuses, finding her 
conduct inexcusable: Wife “was afforded adequate notice to 
appraise her of the pending action.”  She “repeatedly failed to *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
19 provide her financial information,” and missed court hearings, 
the ICA said. 
Wife’s unrepresented status frames her neglect.  Wife 
answered Husband’s complaint and engaged from the case’s start.  
Then, near the first discovery deadline, her attorney withdrew.  
Wife struggled to hire new counsel.  Both her financial 
situation and the putative conflicts faced by Maui family law 
attorneys hurt her efforts.  Wife had no one to advance her 
interests, aid her discovery responses, and ensure she fully 
understood her legal obligations.  See, e.g., Falk v. Allen, 739 
F.2d 461, 464 (9th Cir. 1984) (identifying party’s difficulty
finding counsel as one reason to find excusable neglect).  An
unrepresented party’s non-compliance with discovery demands is
problematic.  Still, it’s unexceptional, especially like here
where detailed discovery requests are made.
Wife’s personal plight provides context to her neglect.  
She and her daughter moved out of their longtime home; she worked two jobs, lived at a monthly financial deficit, and 
experienced emotional issues associated with the dissolution of 
her marriage and her new situation.  Her circumstances show that
she did not willfully try to manipulate the judicial system.  
See e.g. Gharst, 525 P.3d at 254 (“Absent evidence of a 
deliberate attempt to manipulate the legal system, a party 
unfamiliar with the legal system who fails to respond during a  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
20 time of ‘extreme personal difficulty’ should not be considered 
culpable for purposes of the excusable neglect standard.”). 
Next, we turn to Wife’s claim that confusing legal 
documents also contributed to her neglect. 
Wife maintains she did not fully understand the meaning of 
one sentence buried in several documents sent to her P.O. Box.  
Wife didn’t get that she had to attend a status hearing 
regarding discovery and hand over discovery by then – or else.  Without the assistance of counsel, she struggled to make sense 
of “confusing and conflicting notices.” 
The ICA majority describes the legal documents mailed to 
Wife as “not a model of clarity.”  Nevertheless, it believes 
Wife received “adequate notice” that she better show up in court 
and turn over records; otherwise Husband’s proposed divorce 
decree controls their post-marital life.  The ICA points to the 
six of nineteen pages of legal papers Wife received.  There the 
family court’s “ex parte order” has a final sentence: if Wife 
fails to appear at the status hearing or produce discovery, “the 
court may granted [sic] the proposed Divorce Decree submitted 
and filed by [Husband].”  That “proposed Divorce Decree” 
(provided to Wife for the first time) appears to be a document 
titled “Judgment Granting Divorce and Awarding Child Custody.” 
We disagree with the ICA majority’s view that Wife’s 
neglect was inexcusable because she had adequate notice. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 21 To recap, because Counsel forgot to serve Wife with notice 
of a status hearing (and a discovery order), Husband moves ex 
parte to reset the hearing.  Though the hearing is the next day, 
Counsel chooses not to alert Wife by email or phone about the ex 
parte motion and the order granting it.  Later, Counsel mails 
scattered documents to Wife’s P.O. Box.  There are motions and 
orders and a proposed divorce decree: the ex parte motion and ex 
parte order that set a new status hearing date (together), two 
copies of an odd-fonted, one-page, unsigned and uncaptioned 
“order” purporting to grant Husband attorney’s fees and costs, 
and Husband’s divorce decree somewhat misleadingly called 
“Judgment Granting Divorce and Awarding Child Custody.”  Counsel 
authors all the family court orders.  Aside from the unadorned 
attorney’s fees “order,” Counsel’s name and office information 
(like a motion) appear at the top left of each family court 
order.  The “notice” in the “ex parte order” makes no reference 
to HFCR Rule 37(b)(2) or default judgment. 
We conclude the family court inadequately warned Wife about
the risk and consequences of neglect.  An in-court warning goes 
a long way.  See Williams v. Chicago Bd. of Educ., 155 F.3d 853,
858-59 (7th Cir. 1998) (expressing the importance of a court’s 
direct verbal warning about Rule 37 “consequences” and 
encouraging judges “to make even clearer to litigants the 
ramifications of their actions” including “that dismissal  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 22 loom[s] as a real possibility.”)  Here, there was no face-to-
face court warning about the pitfalls – such as an aggressive 
litigation-ending sanction – to neglecting a discovery deadline 
or missing a status hearing about that discovery.  See e.g., 
Malautea, 987 F.2d at 1543-44 (court’s in-court, “explicit” 
warnings of a default judgment sanction for repeated discovery 
violations supported default judgment).   
We turn to notice of the court’s status hearing.  Hearing 
date notices must be clear and conspicuous, especially when an unrepresented or self-represented party has to appear in court. 
See Lai v. Montes, 121 N.Y.S.3d 431 (N.Y. App. Div. 2020) 
(default judgment set aside in part because notice of required appearance was a single sentence in middle of second page of 
three-page order and was not “conspicuous”).  The consequences 
of missing that court date must also be clear and conspicuous.  
See Hathcock v. Navistar Int’l Transp. Corp., 53 F.3d 36, 40 
(4th Cir. 1995) (stressing “the significance of warning a 
defendant about the possibility of default before entering such 
a harsh sanction.”).  
 Here, not only is the hearing date inconspicuous, but the 
ex parte order does not plainly explain that the reset status 
hearing could result in a default judgment against Wife if she 
neglected discovery or didn’t appear in court.  The order makes 
no reference to HFCR Rule 37(b)(2)(C).  And it fails to clearly *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
23 convey that the court could enter default judgment if Wife 
missed the status hearing or did not hand over discovery before 
then.  We view the inartful language in the “ex parte order” as 
inadequate, particularly without an in-court advisement.  
(Understandably, in a classic default judgment case, one 
involving a never-in-court defaulting party, an in-court warning 
will not happen.) 
Wife makes a cogent point: she could not have foreseen that 
her failure to answer discovery would lead to the family court accepting Husband’s unsupported avouchment that his proposed 
property division was fair.  Since Wife has presented sufficient 
evidence that she did not know the real consequences of neglect 
– marital property divvied up so that she kept her fledgling
magazine business with no financial support, while Husband
banked twenty years of equity in the family home - her neglect
was excusable.  See Briones v. Riviera Hotel & Casino, 116 F.3d
379, 380, 382 (9th Cir. 1997) (ignorance of the law by itself
cannot constitute excusable neglect but can be considered where
litigant was pro se and other reasons existed for finding
excusable neglect).
We conclude Wife lacked sufficient notice that neglecting 
discovery and missing a status hearing about discovery would 
lead to the court endorsing nearly word-for-word Husband’s 
proposed division of property and child custody.  Only after the  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 24 court entered default judgment and she retained counsel, Wife 
says, did she understand that the court relied on Husband’s 
untested testimony and his lawyer’s remarks to establish that 
the property division urged by Husband was “just and equitable.”  
See HRS § 580-47(a). 
 Wife could not have anticipated, we 
believe, that the family court would approve Husband’s property division and spousal support wish-list without any supporting 
documents.  Nor could Wife know that the court would remake a status hearing about discovery into a trial about the division 
of marital property.  We do not believe unrepresented Wife could 
have fairly anticipated these developments from the ex parte 
order’s notice. 
Based on the relevant circumstances, Wife did not engage in 
deliberate, willful conduct.  And we see no evidence of bad 
faith or stubbornly disobedient (contumacious) behavior.  
Rather, we view the record as showing excusable neglect. 
 So considering all relevant circumstances, we hold that 
Wife’s neglect was excusable under HFCR Rule 60(b)(1).  
Therefore, the family court abused its discretion by refusing to 
set aside the default judgment.  See PennyMac, 148 Hawaiʻ i at 
327, 474 P.3d at 268 (HRCP Rule 60(b) motions reviewed for abuse 
of discretion). *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 25 C. 
Lastly, we turn to the family court’s decision to default 
Wife as a discovery sanction.  Since the ICA endorses the family 
court’s Rule 37 sanction, we weigh in. 
The ICA majority ruled that the family court correctly 
imposed default as a discovery sanction.  It said Wife’s 
“failure to meet deadlines, appear at hearings, and provide 
reliable information regarding the income from and value of her business,” gave the family court sufficient reason to terminate 
the case per Rule 37. 
 We disagree. 
Hawaiʻi’s justice system disfavors default.  See, e.g., 
Wisenbaker, 101 Hawaiʻ i at 254, 65 P.3d at 1046 (“defaults and 
default judgments are not favored and . . . any doubt should be 
resolved in favor of the party seeking relief, so that, in the interests of justice, there can be a full trial on the merits”) 
(cleaned up)
.  
No Hawaiʻ i Supreme Court case has upheld default as an HFCR, 
HRCP or HRDC Rule 37 discovery sanction.  And, only one 
published Hawaiʻ i appellate case expressly approves default as a 
discovery sanction.  The ICA majority cites it, Aloha Unlimited, 
Inc. v. Coughlin, 79 Hawaiʻ i 527, 904 P.2d 541 (App. 1995). 
The present case bears little resemblance to Aloha 
Unlimited.  There, the trial court dismissed a company’s 
counterclaim.  Aloha Unlimited – represented by counsel - *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 26 violated numerous and varied court orders.  The company (and 
counsel) failed to attend a deposition, something that “was not 
an isolated act but was indicative of its behavior during the 
discovery process.”  The company demonstrated a “contentious 
attitude towards discovery” that “repeatedly forc[ed]” the other
side to obtain orders compelling it to comply with discovery 
requests.  Id. at 535, 904 P.2d at 549.  The ICA dubbed Aloha’s 
“pattern” of conduct as an “obstinate refusal” to comply with court orders and a “willful violation of the discovery rules.”  
Id.  
In contrast, Wife’s behavior was tame.  We do not view 
Wife’s conduct as evincing a pattern of willful or contemptuous 
behavior.  See Weinberg v. Dickson-Weinberg, 123 Hawaiʻ i 68, 77, 
229 P.3d 1133, 1142 (2010) (to warrant a litigation-ending 
sanction, the court must find “evidence of willful or 
contemptuous or otherwise opprobrious behavior.”) 
Aloha Unlimited also differs because Wife lacked counsel.  
Between her first lawyer’s withdrawal and her second lawyer’s 
Rule 60(b) motion, Wife neither appeared in court on her own behalf, nor filed a single court document.  Wife struggled to 
find unconflicted, affordable legal counsel.  She did not self-
represent; she was unrepresented.  Only after the appeal 
deadline passed did she retain counsel and pursue her only path 
to relief. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 27 The ICA majority overlooks criteria this court has used to 
decide whether a trial court abuses its discretion by defaulting 
a party as a discovery sanction: (1) the public’s interest in 
resolving cases quickly; (2) the court’s need to manage its 
docket; (3) whether the party moving for sanctions would be 
prejudiced; (4) the public policy favoring cases being resolved 
on their merits; and (5) whether less drastic sanctions are 
available.  Weinberg, 123 Hawaiʻ i at  71, 229 P.3d at
 1136 (court 
denied a spouse’s motion to extend the pretrial motions 
deadline, preventing her from presenting evidence at trial; thus 
making the court’s action “tantamount to entering a default 
against her” as a discovery sanction.  Id. at 76, 229 P.3d at 
1141). 
The first two factors, speedy endings and judicial 
management, are comparatively less important than the other 
factors.  There’s a generalized interest in resolving cases 
quickly.  And there’s an evident need for a court to “manage its 
docket.”  Here, the case was at an early pretrial stage; a trial 
date had not yet been set.  The record shows no specific reason to close Wife’s case for docket management or speedy resolution 
purposes.
 
Unlike the first two factors, the third factor touches the 
defaulting party’s conduct and whether it causes prejudice.  We 
find no prejudice to Husband.  See supra section III.B.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 28   Regarding the fourth factor, public policy favors giving 
everyone – especially spouses with children and property 
division issues - their day in court.  See Eckard Brandes, 146 
Hawaiʻi at 364, 463 P.3d at 1021. 
Lastly, the family court fails to consider milder sanctions 
short of default.  Aside from attorney’s fees and costs, HFCR 
Rule 37(b)(2)(C) lists alternative measures shy of default, such 
as “striking out pleadings or parts thereof, or staying further 
proceedings until the order is obeyed.”  Husband suggested these 
sanctions in his motion to compel.  Before invoking 
37(b)(2)(C)’s case-ending consequence, the family court should 
have considered other measures, “lesser sanctions.”  See Dela 
Cruz v. Quemado, 141 Hawaiʻ i 338, 345 -46, 409 P.3d 742, 749-50 
(2018) (rejecting the “severe” sanction of default for unintentionally missing a settlement conference, and holding 
that to “better serve the interest of justice” courts have an 
obligation to consider lesser sanctions than default). 
The family court erred by defaulting Wife as a discovery 
sanction. 
IV. 
 We vacate the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal that affirmed the 
orders denying Wife’s motion to set aside default judgment and  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 29 motion for reconsideration.  We remand to the Family Court of 
the Second Circuit.
