OPINION OF THE COURT BY GINOZA, J.  
I. INTRODUCTION 
This appeal arises out of a 2016 personal injury 
lawsuit in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit 
Court)1 filed by Respondent/Plaintiff William Foresman

(Plaintiff) against his uncle, Petitioner/Defendant John 
Foresman (Defendant). Plaintiff seeks  civil damages,  alleging 
that Defendant  sexually abused  him  in 1975 and 1976 when 
Plaintiff  was approximately seven  to eight  years old.  
Plaintiff’s complaint  alleged  claims against Defendant  
for,  inter alia,  intentional infliction of emotional distress  
(IIED), and  assault and battery.   Plaintiff’s claims  against 
Defendant are subject to Hawai‘i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 657-1.8 
(2016),   which  established specific time limitations for 
commencing  a  civil action arising  from  the sexual abuse of a

2 When Plaintiff filed his complaint in 2016, the applicable 
version of HRS § 657-1.8 provided, in relevant part: 
§ 657-1.8 Civil action arising from sexual offenses; 
application; certificate of merit.  (a) Notwithstanding any 
law to the contrary, except as provided under subsection 
(b), no action for recovery of damages based on physical, 
psychological, or other injury or condition suffered by a 
minor arising from the sexual abuse of the minor by any 
person shall be commenced against the person who committed 
the act of sexual abuse more than:  
(1) Eight years after the eighteenth birthday of 
the minor or the person who committed the act 
of sexual abuse attains the age of majority, 
whichever occurs later; or 
(2) Three years after the date the minor discovers 
or reasonably should have discovered that 
psychological injury or illness occurring after 
the age of minor’s eighteenth birthday was 
caused by the sexual abuse, whichever comes 
later. 
 A civil cause of action for the sexual abuse of a 
minor shall be based upon sexual acts that constituted or 
would have constituted a criminal offense under part V or 
VI of chapter 707.   
(Emphasis added.)

minor. The last sentence in  HRS § 657-1.8(a)  states: “A civil 
cause of action for the sexual abuse of a minor shall be based 
upon sexual acts that constituted or would have constituted a 
criminal offense under part V or VI of  [HRS]  chapter 707.”   
(Emphasis added.)   Defendant challenges the validity of HRS  
§ 657-1.8(a), asserting that it  violates the ex post facto 
clause of article I, section 10 of the United States 
Constitution.
   At trial,  the Circuit Court  instructed the jury  
on multiple criminal statutes in existence when the complaint 
was filed,  over Defendant’s objection  that the instructions 
should have been based on criminal statutes existing when the 
alleged acts occurred. The jury  awarded Plaintiff $50,000 in 
general damages and $200,000 in punitive damages.

Defendant appealed to the Intermediate Court of 
Appeals (ICA), claiming that under the statutes in place when 
the alleged acts occurred, his conduct would not have been 
criminal offenses. Thus, Defendant asserts he should not be 
liable for claims based on subsequent criminal law. The ICA 
held that Defendant failed to show the ex post facto clause was 
violated under the jury instructions given by the Circuit Court. 
3 Article I, section 10 of the United States Constitution states 
that “[n]o State shall . . . pass any . . . ex post facto Law[.]”

*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
We hold that HRS § 657-1.8(a) establishes a statute of 
limitations for commencing a civil cause of action based on the 
sexual abuse of a minor. It does not create an independent 
cause of action. HRS § 657-1.8(a) covers claims where the 
underlying “sexual acts” constitute or constituted a “criminal 
offense” as defined in that section. To determine whether the 
underlying “sexual acts” constitute a “criminal offense” 
pursuant to HRS § 657-1.8(a), we conclude the applicable 
criminal statutes are those in effect when the alleged conduct 
occurred. 
Thus, the Circuit Court erred by instructing the jury 
on criminal statutes that were in effect when the complaint was 
filed. We nonetheless conclude that the Circuit Court’s 
erroneous jury instructions were harmless in this case, where 
the record shows that Defendant admitted to conduct that would 
have constituted a criminal offense under at least two criminal 
statutes in part V of HRS Chapter 707 that were in effect when 
the conduct occurred. 
Our reasoning in this case differs from the ICA, but 
our disposition is the same. We affirm the ICA’s Judgment on 
Appeal, which affirmed the Circuit Court’s Final Judgment.

II. BACKGROUND 
A. Factual Background4 
In or around 1975 and 1976, Defendant,  who is 
Plaintiff’s uncle,  resided in Plaintiff’s family home in Hawai‘i. 
During that time, Plaintiff was approximately seven  to eight  
years old, and Defendant was approximately  fifteen  to sixteen  
years old. Plaintiff alleges that  while residing in the same 
home, Defendant masturbated in front of  Plaintiff, forced 
Plaintiff  to fondle Defendant’s  genitals on multiple occasions, 
and  forced Plaintiff  to perform oral sex on Defendant.   
The record, as well as Defendant’s own admissions, 
indicate that Defendant masturbated in front of Plaintiff, and 
that Plaintiff fondled Defendant’s genitals on multiple 
occasions. The record includes Defendant’s response to a 
request for admissions, wherein Defendant admitted that he 
resided in Plaintiff’s family home in 1975 and 1976, and that 
during that time, he masturbated in front of Plaintiff, and 
4   The factual background is based on the limited record on appeal. 
For the appellate record, the Defendant requested only partial transcripts of 
the October 2, 2018 Circuit Court proceedings regarding settlement of jury 
instructions.  The duty was on Defendant, as the petitioner, to provide this 
court with an adequate record on appeal. See  Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 
Hawai‘i 225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 558  (1995)  (“The burden is upon appellant in 
an appeal to show error by reference to matters in the record, and he or she 
has the responsibility of providing an adequate transcript.” (citations  and 
brackets omitted)). Thus, the record before us does not reflect the 
arguments, objections, and testimony that were  adduced during the jury trial 
proceedings. The record on appeal, however, does reflect various pre -trial 
filings and the exhibits that were entered into evidence at trial.

*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Plaintiff touched his genitals. The record also contains an 
October 4, 2013 email sent from Defendant’s email address to 
Plaintiff’s father. In the email, Defendant apologized to 
Plaintiff’s father, and stated that he “did not act 
appropriately” with Plaintiff while residing with them. The 
email states in relevant part: 
I did jack off with him there and yeah . . . I asked him to 
help a little and he did. I would guesstimate 3, 4, maybe 
5 times. It was a long time ago . . . It was not a routine 
event. No matter I should have known better. I only offer 
those figures to help you quantify what happened.

B. Procedural Background 
1. Circuit Court Proceedings 
a. Pre-Trial Proceedings 
On April 15, 2016, Plaintiff filed a civil complaint 
against Defendant in Circuit Court asserting that he was 
entitled to damages stemming from childhood sexual abuse 
perpetrated against him by Defendant. The complaint asserted 
causes of action against Defendant for rape and sexual assault, 
IIED, and assault and battery. Plaintiff sought, inter alia, 
special damages, general damages, and punitive or exemplary 
damages. 
The complaint asserted that “[t]he conduct of 
Defendant . . . described [in the complaint] constitutes or 
would have constituted a criminal offense under part V and/or VI

Chapter 707, [HRS]” and that Plaintiff “has satisfied all common 
law and statutory requirements for the filing of this action, 
including but not limited to all requirements set forth in [HRS] 
§ 657-1.8.” 
In June 2016, Plaintiff sought and was granted leave 
to file a certificate of merit under seal, pursuant to HRS 
§ 657-1.8(d). 5 
Plaintiff’s pre-trial statement asserted that 
Defendant “committed the actions of child sexual abuse pursuant 
to [HRS] § 657-1.8, assault, battery, false imprisonment, 
[IIED], and negligent infliction of emotional distress” (NIED), 
5 The applicable version of HRS § 657-1.8(d) (2016) provided: 
(d) In any civil action filed pursuant to subsection 
(a) or (b) [of HRS § 657-1.8], a certificate of merit shall 
be filed by the attorney for the plaintiff, and shall be 
sealed and remain confidential. The certificate of merit 
shall include a notarized statement by a:  
(1) Psychologist licensed pursuant to chapter 465; 
(2) Marriage and family therapist licensed pursuant 
to chapter 451J; 
(3) Mental health counselor licensed pursuant to 
chapter 453D; or 
(4) Clinical social worker licensed pursuant to 
chapter 467E; 
who is knowledgeable in the relevant facts and issues 
involved in the action, who is not a party to the action. 
The notarized statement included in the certificate 
of merit shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and 
opinions relied upon to conclude that there is a reasonable 
basis to believe that the plaintiff was subject to one or 
more acts that would result in an injury or condition 
specified in [subsection] (a).

*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
and that his actions were the cause and/or a substantial factor 
“in severe and permanent mental, and pecuniary damages to 
Plaintiff.” 
Defendant’s responsive pre-trial statement stated that 
Defendant masturbated in Plaintiff’s presence, but that 
Defendant “never directed or forced Plaintiff to touch his 
genitals.” 
In his trial brief, Plaintiff asserted that 
Defendant’s alleged sexual acts constituted or would constitute 
the present criminal offenses of, inter alia: Indecent Exposure, 
in violation of HRS § 707-7346; Sexual Assault in the Third 
Degree, in violation of HRS § 707-7327; Sexual Assault in the 
First Degree, in violation of HRS § 707-7308; and Continuous 
Sexual Assault of a Minor Under the Age of Fourteen Years, in 
6 HRS § 707-734 (2014) entitled “Indecent exposure” provides, in 
relevant part, that: “A person commits the offense of indecent exposure if, 
the person intentionally exposes the person’s genitals to a person to whom 
the person is not married under circumstances in which the actor’s conduct is 
likely to cause affront.” 
7 HRS § 707-732 (2014) entitled “Sexual assault in the third 
degree” provides, in relevant part, that: “A person commits the offense of 
sexual assault in the third degree if: . . . . (b) The person knowingly 
subjects to sexual contact another person who is less than fourteen years old 
or causes such a person to have sexual contact with the person[.]” 
8 HRS § 707-730 (2014) entitled “Sexual assault in the first 
degree” provides, in relevant part, that: “A person commits the offense of 
sexual assault in the first degree if: . . . . (b) The person knowingly 
engages in sexual penetration with a person who is less than fourteen years 
old[.]”

*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
violation of HRS § 707-733.6.9 Plaintiff asserted that his 
“causes of action for sexual abuse arising from the above-
mentioned sexual acts [are] [IIED], and [NIED]” and that he has 
“suffered injuries that were proximately caused by the sexual 
assaults.” 
Defendant filed a trial brief generally denying he 
committed any torts against the Plaintiff. 
b. Jury Trial Proceedings 
An eight-day jury trial began on September 24, 2018, 
and concluded on October 8, 2018. 
To establish that his claims were based on acts that 
constituted criminal offenses, as covered by HRS § 657-1.8(a), 
Plaintiff proposed jury instructions based on the Hawai‘i Penal 
Code that was in effect at the time the lawsuit was filed. 
Specifically, Plaintiff proposed instructions on Sexual Assault 
9 HRS § 707-733.6 (2014) entitled “Continuous sexual assault of a 
minor under the age of fourteen years” provides, in relevant part, that: 
(1) A person commits the offense of continuous sexual 
assault of a minor under the age of fourteen years if the person: 
(a) Either resides in the same home with a minor under 
the age of fourteen years or has recurring access to 
the minor; and 
(b) Engages in three or more acts of sexual penetration 
or sexual contact with the minor over a period of 
time, while the minor is under the age of fourteen 
years.

in the First Degree,   Sexual Assault in the Third Degree,  
Indecent Exposure,  and Continuous Sexual Assault of a Minor 
Under the Age of Fourteen Years.     13
12 
11 10
10 Plaintiff’s proposed instruction on Sexual Assault in the First 
Degree read as follows: 
A person commits the offense of Sexual Assault in the 
First Degree if he/she knowingly engages in sexual 
penetration with a minor who is less than fourteen years 
old. 
There are three material elements of the offense of 
Sexual Assault in the First Degree each of which the 
plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence. 
These three elements are: 
1. That, the Defendant engaged in sexual penetration 
with [Plaintiff]; and 
2. That the Defendant did so knowingly; and 
3. That [Plaintiff] was less than fourteen years old 
at the time. 
“Sexual penetration” means: 
Vaginal intercourse, anal intercourse, fellatio, 
deviate sexual intercourse, or any intrusion of any part of 
a person’s body or of any object into the genital or anal 
opening of another person’s body; it occurs upon any 
penetration, however slight, but emission is not 
required[.] 
11 Plaintiff’s proposed instruction on Sexual Assault in the Third 
Degree read as follows: 
A person commits the offense of Sexual Assault in the 
Third Degree if he/she knowingly subjects to sexual contact 
another person who is less than fourteen years old or causes 
another person who is less than fourteen years old to have 
sexual contact with him/her.  
There are three material elements of the offense of 
Sexual Assault in the Third Degree which the Plaintiff has the 
burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence. 
These three elements are:

*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
1. That the Defendant subjected [Plaintiff] to 
sexual contact or caused [Plaintiff] to have sexual contact 
with him; and 
2. That the Defendant did so knowingly; and 
3. That [Plaintiff] was less than fourteen years 
old at that time. 
“Sexual contact” means any touching, other than acts 
of “sexual penetration”, of the sexual or other intimate parts 
of a person not married to the actor, or of the sexual or 
other intimate parts of the actor by the person, whether 
directly or through the clothing or other material intended to 
cover the sexual or other intimate parts.   
12 Plaintiff’s proposed instruction on Indecent Exposure read as 
follows: 
A person commits the offense of indecent exposure if, the 
person  intentionally exposes the person’s genitals to a person to 
whom the person is not married under circumstances in which the 
actor’s conduct is likely to cause affront.  
There are three material elements of the offense of indecent 
exposure which the Plaintiff has the burden of proving. 
These three elements are: 
1. That the [D]efendant intentionally exposed his genitals to 
[Plaintiff]; 
2. That the Defendant was not married to the [Plaintiff]; and 
3. That the exposure occurred under circumstances in which the 
Defendant’s conduct was likely to cause affront. 
13 Plaintiff’s proposed instruction on Continuous Sexual Assault of 
a Minor Under the Age of Fourteen Years read as follows: 
A person commits the offense of continuous sexual assault 
of a minor under the age of fourteen years if the person: 
(a) Either resides in the same home with a minor under 
the age of fourteen years or has recurring access to the 
minor; and 
(b) Engages in three or more acts of sexual penetration 
or sexual contact with the minor over a period of time, while 
the minor is under the age of fourteen years. 
There are three material elements of the offense of 
continuous sexual assault of a minor under the  age of fourteen 
years which the Plaintiff has the burden of proving.

*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Defendant’s proposed jury instructions did not appear 
to be based on any specific criminal statutes. 
The Circuit Court held a hearing to settle jury 
instructions. There, Defendant objected to Plaintiff’s proposed 
instructions on Sexual Assault in the First Degree, Sexual 
Assault in the Third Degree, Indecent Exposure, and Continuous 
Sexual Assault of a Minor Under the Age of Fourteen Years. 
Defendant argued that Plaintiff’s proposed instructions should 
be rejected because “the crimes that are referred to should be 
the ones that are defined as of the date of the alleged incident 
and that if an individual is liable for a crime that was not in 
existence at the time of the alleged act that that would be 
violative of due process and violative of fundamental fairness 
under the Constitution.” (Emphasis added.) 
The Circuit Court ruled that it would give Plaintiff’s 
proposed instructions on criminal offenses over Defendant’s 
objection. The Circuit Court reasoned that its ruling was 
These three elements are: 
1. The Defendant resided in the same home with or had 
recurring access to [Plaintiff]; 
2. The Defendant engaged in three or more acts of sexual 
penetration or sexual contact with the [Plaintiff] 
over a period of time; and 
3. During this period of time [Plaintiff] was under the 
age of fourteen years.

*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
based upon the plain language of HRS section 657-1.8, 
subsection (a), which states, quote, “A civil cause of 
action for the sexual abuse of a minor shall be based upon 
sexual acts that constituted or would have constituted a 
criminal offense under part V or VI of chapter 707.” So 
the phrase “constituted or would have constituted” 
indicates the legislature intended, by the plain meaning of 
those words, to have acts that occurred in the past that 
would otherwise have been barred by the statute of 
limitations be treated based upon the way the acts are 
treated under chapter 707 at the time the lawsuit is 
brought. 
At the close of trial,  the Circuit Court, inter alia,  
instructed the jury  on Plaintiff’s proposed instructions on  
Sexual Assault in the First Degree, Sexual Assault in the Third 
Degree, Indecent Exposure, and Continuous Sexual Assault of a 
Minor Under the Age of Fourteen Years,  with non-substantive 
amendments.   
The jury found Defendant liable, and awarded Plaintiff 
general damages in the amount of $50,000  and  punitive damages in 
the amount of  $200,000.  
On November 28, 2018, the Circuit Court entered its 
Final Judgment in accordance with the jury’s verdict. 
2. ICA Proceedings 
Defendant appealed the Circuit Court’s Final Judgment 
to the ICA. He asserted that HRS § 657-1.8 is unconstitutional 
because it violates the ex post facto clause of article I, 
section 10 of the United States Constitution by imposing 
punishment in the form of civil liability for acts committed in 
1975 and 1976, despite those acts allegedly not constituting 
13  
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
  
  
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
criminal offenses at the time they were committed. A central 
contention in Defendant’s ex post facto argument was that the 
Circuit Court erred by instructing the jury on the elements of 
subsequently enacted criminal statutes, rather than the relevant 
criminal statutes in effect at the time the alleged conduct 
occurred. 14 
In response, Plaintiff maintained that HRS § 657-1.8 
is constitutional. Plaintiff asserted further that any alleged 
error committed by the Circuit Court was harmless because the 
record on the whole demonstrates that the sexual acts to which 
Defendant admitted satisfy, at minimum, the requirements of at 
least one criminal statute that was in effect at the time the 
alleged conduct occurred. 
On March 6, 2024, the ICA issued a Summary Disposition 
Order affirming the Circuit Court’s Final Judgment.   Foresman v. 
Foresman, No. CAAP-18-0000941, 2024 WL 966889 (Haw. App. Mar. 6, 
2024) (SDO).  The ICA determined  —  based on federal case law  and 
this court’s decision in State v. Guidry, 105 Hawai‘i 222, 96 
P.3d 242 (2004)  —  that HRS § 657-1.8 is a civil statute, has a 
non-punitive purpose, and that Defendant failed to show that the 
14    Defendant also asserted, without supporting argument, that 
because HRS § 657-1.8(a) violates the ex post facto clause, it also violates 
due process under the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution, 
and article I, section 5 of the Hawai‘i Constitution.   This contention was 
waived for lack of any argument in support.

*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
statute’s alleged punitive effect overcomes its nonpunitive 
purpose, such that it violates the ex post facto clause. Id. at 
*2-3.15 
3. Certiorari Proceedings 
On certiorari, Defendant reasserts that HRS § 657-1.8 
violates the ex post facto clause of the United States 
Constitution, and maintains that the Circuit Court erred in its 
interpretation and application of HRS § 657-1.8(a) by 
instructing the jury on the elements of subsequently enacted 
criminal offenses. 
In response, Plaintiff argues that the ICA properly 
determined that HRS § 657-1.8 does not violate the ex post facto 
clause of the United States Constitution. 
III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Constitutional Law 
“Questions of constitutional law are reviewed de novo, 
under the right/wrong standard.” State v. Tran, 154 Hawai‘i 211, 
217, 549 P.3d 296, 302 (2024) (citation, internal quotation 
marks, and brackets omitted).  
15 The ICA did not directly address Defendant’s arguments regarding 
due process and improper jury instructions on criminal statutes. Foresman, 
2024 WL 966889, at *1 n.3. As to Defendant’s improper jury instruction 
argument, the ICA stated in a footnote that Defendant “provided no 
discernable argument” on that point, and “thus, we deem it waived, or at 
minimum, subsumed within the ex post facto argument.” Id. (citing Hawai‘i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(7); and Hawaii Ventures, LLC v.

*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
B. Statutory Interpretation 
Questions of statutory interpretation are questions of law 
to be reviewed de novo under the right/wrong standard. 
Our statutory construction is guided by the following 
well established principles: 
our foremost obligation is to ascertain and 
give effect to the intention of the 
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily 
from the language contained in the statute 
itself. And we must read statutory language in 
the context of the entire statute and construe 
it in a manner consistent with its purpose. 
When there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or 
indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an 
expression used in a statute, an ambiguity 
exists. 
In construing an ambiguous statute, the meaning 
of the ambiguous words may be sought by 
examining the context, with which the ambiguous 
words, phrases, and sentences may be compared, 
in order to ascertain their true meaning. 
Moreover, the courts may resort to extrinsic 
aids in determining legislative intent. One 
avenue is the use of legislative history as an 
interpretive tool. 
[The appellate] court may also consider the reason 
and spirit of the law, and the cause which induced 
the legislature to enact it to discover its true 
meaning.

  IV. DISCUSSION 
  A. HRS § 657 -1.8 
HRS § 657-1.8 took effect on April 24, 2012. See 2012 
Haw. Sess. Laws Act 68, § 1 and § 3 at 156-58. T he crux of 
Defendant’s argument stems from the Circuit Court’s 
interpretation of section (a) of the statute. The necessary 
starting point for our analysis is our de novo interpretation of 
the contested statutory provision – HRS § 657-1.8(a). 
We note that HRS § 657-1.8 has since been amended. We 
apply the 2016 version of the statute here. 
1. HRS § 657-1.8(a) Establishes a Statute of Limitations 
for Commencing a Civil Action and Does Not Violate the 
Ex Post Facto Clause. 
Defendant argues that HRS § 657-1.8(a) is 
unconstitutional because it violates the ex post facto clause of 
the United States Constitution by imposing punishment in the 
form of civil liability for acts committed in 1975 and 1976, 
17  
 
 
 
 
 
 
     
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
despite those acts allegedly not constituting criminal offenses 
at the time they were committed. 
Article I, section 10 of the United States 
Constitution states that “[n]o State shall . . . pass any . . . 
ex post facto Law[.]”   Defendant relies on Calder v. Bull, 3 
U.S. 386 (1798), wherein  the U.S.  Supreme Court explained  that  
the  types of laws that were  considered  ex post facto laws 
included:  “[e]very law that makes an action, done before the 
passing of the law, and which was innocent when done, 
criminal[,]  and punishes such action[;]”  “[e]very law that 
aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than it was, when 
committed[;]” and “[e]very law that changes the punishment, and 
inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to the 
crime, when committed.” Id.  at 390. As further explained by 
the U.S. Supreme Court,  the federal ex post facto clause 
prohibits legislatures from retroactively “altering  the 
definition of criminal conduct  or increasing  the punishment for 
the  crime[.]”  Lynce v. Mathis, 519 U.S. 433, 441 (1997) (citing  
Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U.S. 37, 50  (1990)).  
In Smith v. Doe, 538 U.S. 84, 92 (2003), the U.S. 
Supreme Court addressed whether a sex offender registration and 
notification law that applied retroactively violated the ex post 
facto clause. The Court held that the law did not violate the 
18  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
ex post facto clause. Id. at 105-06. T he Court explained the 
framework for considering the issue as follows: 
We must “ascertain whether the legislature meant the 
statute to establish  ‘civil’ proceedings.”   Kansas v. 
Hendricks,  [521 U.S. 346, 361]  (1997).  If the intention of 
the legislature was to impose punishment, that ends the 
inquiry.  If, however, the intention was to enact a 
regulatory scheme that is civil and nonpunitive, we must 
further examine whether the statutory scheme is “‘so 
punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate [the 
State’s] intention’ to deem it ‘civil.’” Ibid. (quoting 
United States v. Ward, [448 U.S. 242, 248-49] (1980)). 
Because we “ordinarily defer to the legislature’s stated 
intent,” Hendricks, [521 U.S. at 361], “‘only the clearest 
proof’ will suffice to override legislative intent and 
transform what has been denominated a civil remedy  into a 
criminal penalty,” Hudson v. United States, [522 U.S. 93, 
100] (1997) (quoting Ward, [448 U.S. at 249]); see also 
Hendricks, [521 U.S. at 361]; United States v. Ursery, [518 
U.S. 267, 290] (1996); United States v. One Assortment of 
89 Firearms, [465 U.S. 354, 365] (1984).  
Id. at 92. 
Here, Defendant’s arguments on appeal  treat HRS § 657-
1.8(a)  as creating a new  civil  cause of action based on conduct 
that occurred over forty years before the complaint was filed 
and deemed criminal based on statutes in place when the 
complaint was filed.   To the contrary,  and discussed below,  we 
interpret HRS § 657-1.8(a) as establishing  a  specific  statute of 
limitations  for civil causes of actions  that are  based on the 
sexual abuse of a minor. We further construe this  statute  of 
limitations  as covering causes of action  where  the underlying 
sexual abuse of a minor must be based on criminal statutes 
existing at the time of the alleged conduct.

*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Under the framework for analyzing the issue set out in 
Smith, HRS § 657-1.8(a) does not violate the ex post facto 
clause. First, HRS § 657-1.8(a) allows for the commencement of 
civil proceedings seeking civil remedies, and its reference to 
the Hawai‘i Penal Code does not transform it into a criminal 
statute that seeks to punish. See Sheehan v. Oblates of St. 
Francis de Sales, 15 A.3d 1247, 1258 (Del. 2011). Rather, the 
Hawai‘i Legislature intended the statute to extend the statute of 
limitations for those sexually abused as a minor to commence 
civil actions to recover damages, and also to protect other 
children from such abuse. HRS § 657-1.8(a) is nonpunitive. 
Second, based on our interpretation, HRS § 657-1.8(a) was not 
intended to apply present law to past acts that did not 
constitute a criminal offense when committed. That is, claims 
covered by HRS § 657-1.8(a) should be based on applying the 
criminal law existing when the alleged sexual abuse occurred. 
The purpose and effect of HRS § 657-1.8(a) is not so punitive as 
to overcome the legislature’s intent to extend the time to seek 
civil remedies for the sexual abuse of a minor. 16 
16 This case is clearly distinguishable from Stogner v. California, 
539 U.S. 607 (2003), where the U.S. Supreme Court held that the ex post facto 
clause was violated by a state statute establishing a new limitations period 
for criminal prosecutions of sex-related child abuse crimes where the 
limitations period had already expired under prior statutes. As recognized 
in Stogner, the California statute in that case was, inter alia, within the 
second category of cases identified in Calder v. Bull as being ex post facto 
laws, and it has been long recognized that the ex post facto clause “forbids 
resurrection of a time-barred prosecution.” Id. at 612-16.

*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
We first address HRS § 657-1.8(a) as being a statute 
of limitations. Black’s Law Dictionary defines a “statute of 
limitations” as:  
[a] law that bars claims after a specified period; 
specif[ically], a statute establishing a time limit for 
suing in a civil case, based on the date when the claim 
accrued (as when the injury occurred or was discovered). . 
. . The purpose of such a statute is to require diligent 
prosecution of known claims, thereby providing finality and 
predictability in legal affairs and ensuring that claims 
will be resolved while evidence is reasonably available and 
fresh. 
Black’s Law Dictionary  1713  (12th ed. 2024). In simpler terms, 
statutes of limitation “represent a public policy about the 
privilege to litigate.” Chase Sec. Corp. v. Donaldson, 325 U.S. 
304, 314 (1945).  
Here, HRS § 657-1.8 (2016) is titled “Civil action 
arising from sexual offenses; application; certificate of merit” 
and is  contained  within  HRS  Title 36 entitled “Civil Remedies 
and Defenses  and Special Proceedings” and HRS Chapter 657 
entitled “Limitation of Actions[.]”  The  applicable version of 
HRS § 657-1.8 (2016) provided, in relevant part:  
(a) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, except 
as provided under subsection (b), no action for recovery of 
damages based on physical, psychological, or other injury 
or condition suffered by a minor arising from the sexual 
abuse of the minor by any person shall be commenced against 
the person who committed the act of sexual abuse more than: 
(1) Eight years after the eighteenth birthday of 
the minor or the person who committed the act 
of sexual abuse attains the age of majority, 
whichever occurs later; or 
(2) Three years after the date the minor discovers 
or reasonably should have discovered that 
psychological injury or illness occurring after

*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the age of minor’s eighteenth birthday was 
caused by the sexual abuse, whichever comes 
later. 
A civil cause of action for the sexual abuse of a 
minor shall be based upon sexual acts that constituted or 
would have constituted a criminal offense under part V or 
VI of chapter 707.  
(b) For a period of four years after April 24, 2012, 
a victim of child sexual abuse that occurred in this State 
may file a claim in a circuit court of this State against 
the person who committed the act of sexual abuse if the 
victim is barred from filing a claim against the victim’s 
abuser due to the expiration of the applicable civil 
statute of limitations that was in effect prior to April 
24, 2012. 
A claim may also be brought under this subsection 
against a legal entity if: 
(1) The person who committed the act of sexual 
abuse against the victim was employed by an 
institution, agency, firm, business, 
corporation, or other public or private legal 
entity that owed a duty of care to the victim; 
or 
(2) The person who committed the act of sexual 
abuse and the victim were engaged in an 
activity over which the legal entity had a 
degree of responsibility or control. 
Damages against the legal entity shall be awarded 
under this subsection only if there is a finding of gross 
negligence on the part of the legal entity. 
 . . . . 
(d) In any civil action filed pursuant to subsection 
(a) or (b), a certificate of merit shall be filed by the 
attorney for the plaintiff, and shall be sealed and remain 
confidential. T he certificate of merit shall include a 
notarized statement by a: 
(1) Psychologist licensed pursuant to chapter 465; 
(2) Marriage and family therapist licensed pursuant 
to chapter 451J; 
(3) Mental health counselor licensed pursuant to 
chapter 453D; or 
(4) Clinical social worker licensed pursuant to 
chapter 467E; 
who is knowledgeable in the relevant facts and issues 
involved in the action, who is not a party to the action.

*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The notarized statement included in the certificate 
of merit shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and 
opinions relied upon to conclude that there is a reasonable 
basis to believe that the plaintiff was subject to one or 
more acts that would result in an injury or condition 
specified in [subsection] (a). 
HRS § 657-1.8 (emphasis added). 
The plain language of HRS § 657-1.8(a) supports our 
interpretation that it establishes a statute of limitation. 
Section (a) provides specific time limitations as to when a 
civil action stemming from sexual abuse of a minor may be 
commenced. 
HRS § 657-1.8 also includes the type of underlying 
conduct to which the statute applies, and specific requirements 
related to the filing of a civil action pursuant to the statute. 
For example, the last clause of HRS § 657-1.8(a) – the 
challenged provision in this case – mandates that civil causes 
of actions brought under the statute “shall be based upon sexual 
acts that constituted or would have constituted a criminal 
offense under part V or VI of [HRS] chapter 707.” Moreover, HRS 
§ 657-1.8(d) requires that a plaintiff’s counsel file with the 
court a certificate of merit which must include a notarized 
statement by an enumerated licensed mental health professional 
providing “the facts and opinions relied upon to conclude that 
there is a reasonable basis to believe that the plaintiff was 
subject to one or more acts that would result in an injury or 
condition specified in [subsection] (a).”

*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The history and context of the statute further support 
our interpretation of  HRS § 657-1.8(a) as establishing  a statute 
of limitations. HRS § 657-1.8 was enacted in 2012 via Act 68. 
2012 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 68, §  1 at 156-58. The legislature 
stated  that the purpose and intent of HRS § 657-1.8 was “to 
provide victims of sexual abuse a fair chance to bring a civil 
action against an individual or entity”  by, inter alia,  
“extend[ing]  the statute of limitations  . . . to allow 
individuals subjected to sexual offenses as a minor to bring a 
civil action against the individual who committed the offense.”   
S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 2473, in 2012 Senate Journal, at 1033; 
see also  H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1013-12, in 2012 House 
Journal, at 1326; H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1313-12, in 2012 
House Journal, at 1447; H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1574-12, in 
2012 House Journal, at 1523.  
In adopting the provision, the legislature found that: 
child sex abuse is an epidemic that unfortunately is not 
adequately addressed because a vast majority of child abuse 
victims fail to go to the authorities. As a result, claims 
expire before these victims are capable of seeking court 
action. Many victims suffer the effects of sexual abuse in 
silence due to the shame and secrecy of this act while 
their perpetrators remain hidden with a potential 
opportunity to sexually abuse additional victims.   This 
measure protects children from sexual abuse by allowing 
additional time for victims to seek action.

*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
A central purpose of HRS § 657-1.8 is to extend the 
statute of limitations for victims to file civil actions against 
a person or legal entity for past acts of sexual abuse when the 
victims were minors. 
Our interpretation of HRS § 657-1.8(a) as 
establishing a statute of limitations is consistent with how 
courts in other jurisdictions have interpreted similar statutes. 
For example, California, Washington, Kansas, Vermont, and 
Delaware have each adopted similar statutes for bringing civil 
causes of action stemming from alleged childhood sexual abuse. 
See Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 340.1 (West 2024); Wash. Rev. Code 
Ann. § 4.16.340 (West 2024); Kan. Stat. Ann. § 60-523 (West 
2023); Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, § 522 (West 2021); Del. Code Ann. 
tit. 10, § 8145 (West 2009). Akin to HRS § 657-1.8(a), the 
relevant laws in each of those states include provisions that 
specify the time limits for bringing a civil cause of action for 
childhood sexual abuse against an alleged abuser or responsible 
party, and include provisions specifying that claims brought 
under the statute must be based on acts that constituted 
criminal offenses under applicable provisions of their 
respective criminal code. 
The highest courts in each of those states recognize 
those provisions as statutes of limitation. See Los Angeles 
Unified Sch. Dist. v. Superior Ct., 529 P.3d 1096, 1107 (Cal. 
25

“has been amended on multiple occasions to extend the filing 
periods for claims alleging childhood sexual assault and revive 
otherwise time-barred claims” - as a statute of limitations); 
Wolf v. State, 534 P.3d 822, 829, 833 (Wash. 2023) (en banc) 
(interpreting Wash. Rev. Code Ann. § 4.16.340 as “a special 
statute of limitations that applies to civil actions for 
injuries resulting from childhood sexual abuse[,]” and therefore 
an affirmative defense which the party raising the defense has 
the burden of proving); H.B. v. M.J., 508 P.3d 368, 372-73 (Kan. 
2022) (acknowledging that Kan. Stat. Ann. § 60-523 is a statute 
of limitations governing civil actions for damages suffered as a 
result of childhood sexual abuse); A.B. v. S.U., 298 A.3d 573, 
574-82 (Vt. 2023) (recognizing Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, § 522 -
which removed the limitations period to bring civil causes of 
action based on childhood sexual abuse – as a statute of 
limitation and holding that it does not violate due process 
under the Vermont Constitution); Sheehan, 15 A.3d at 1251, 1258-
59 (holding that the Child Victim’s Act - which “abolished the 
civil statute of limitations for claims of childhood sexual 
abuse and created a two year window to allow victims of 
childhood sexual abuse to bring civil suits that the statute of 
limitations previously barred” – “is and continues to be a civil

statute of limitations affecting matters of procedure and 
remedy” and does not violate state nor federal due process). 
Moreover, under those analogous provisions, multiple 
causes of action may be brought for damages stemming from 
alleged child sexual abuse. See LAUSD, 529 P.3d at 1099 
(asserting civil claims for sexual abuse, intentional infliction 
of emotional distress, and sexual harassment for damages under 
Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 340.1); Wolf, 534 P.3d at 826 (asserting 
civil claims for negligence and wrongful death for damages under 
Wash. Rev. Code Ann. § 4.16.340); H.B., 508 P.3d at 70-71 
(asserting negligence claims against multiple defendants for 
damages under Kan. Stat. Ann. § 60-523); A.B., 298 A.3d at 575 
(asserting civil claims for child sexual abuse, nuisance, and 
grossly negligent supervision and retention for damages under 
Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, § 522); Sheehan, 15 A.3d at 1252 
(addressing claims for negligence against several institutional 
defendants for damages under Delaware’s Child Victim’s Act). 
This court has long construed statutes of limitation 
as waivable affirmative defenses, wherein the party raising the 
defense has the burden of proof. See Hawai‘i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) Rule 8(c) (eff. 2000) (listing statute of 
limitations as an affirmative defense); Webb v. OSF Int’l, Inc., 
No. SCWC-19-0000618, 2025 WL 455236, at *8 (Haw. Feb. 11, 2025) 
(emphasizing that “Hawai‘i law generally treats statutes of

*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
limitations as affirmative defenses” that the asserting party 
must establish and which can be waived  (citations omitted));  
Kellberg v. Yuen,  135 Hawai‘i 236, 254, 349 P.3d 343, 361  (2015)  
(“[T]he statute of limitations is a personal defense that a 
defendant may waive[.]”); U.S. Bank Nat’l Ass’n v. Castro, 131 
Hawai‘i 28, 41, 313 P.3d 717, 730 (2013)  (“Generally, the 
defendant has the burden of proof on all affirmative defenses, 
which includes proving facts which are essential to the asserted 
defense.”   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted));  see 
also  GECC Fin. Corp. v. Jaffarian, 79 Hawai‘i 516, 526, 904 P.2d 
530, 540 (App. 1995) (Acoba, J., concurring) (explaining that 
affirmative defenses not supported by evidence may be 
abandoned), aff’d, 80 Hawai‘i 118, 905 P.2d 624 (1995). HRS § 
657-1.8 is no different.  
Based on the foregoing, we hold that HRS § 657-1.8(a) 
establishes a statute of limitations for commencing a civil 
cause of action based on the sexual abuse of a minor. 
2. The Criminal Statutes Applicable Under HRS § 657-
1.8(a) Are Those in Effect When the Alleged Sexual 
Abuse of the Minor Occurred. 
We  next  address the challenged provision in HRS § 657-
1.8(a), which states: “A civil cause of action for the sexual 
abuse of a minor shall be based upon sexual acts that 
constituted or would have constituted a criminal offense under 
part V or VI of chapter 707.”   (Emphasis added.)    
28  
 
 
 
 
     
  
 
  
  
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Below, the Circuit Court interpreted  the phrase 
“constituted or would have constituted” in HRS § 657-1.8(a) to 
“indicate[] [that] the legislature intended, by the plain 
meaning of those words,  to have acts that occurred in the past 
that  would otherwise have been barred by the statute of 
limitations be treated based upon the way the acts are treated 
under chapter 707 at the time the lawsuit is brought.”   
Accordingly,  the Circuit Court instructed  the jury  on several 
criminal statutes  as they existed  at the time the  complaint was 
filed, over Defendant’s objection. Defendant argues  that the 
Circuit Court erred  and should have instead instructed the jury 
on criminal statutes existing when the alleged sexual abuse 
occurred.   We agree  with Defendant on this point.  
In assessing the subject provision, we follow this 
court’s established rules of statutory interpretation and first 
look to the plain language of the statute. See State v. 
Demello, 136 Hawai‘i 193, 195, 361 P.3d 420, 422 (2015). Here, 
the plain language of the statute does not expressly provide 
whether the alleged sexual acts should be determined to be a 
criminal offense based on criminal statutes in effect when a 
lawsuit is initiated or when the alleged conduct occurred. 
Rather, the statute provides that civil actions brought under 
HRS § 657-1.8 “shall be based upon sexual acts that constituted 
or would have constituted a criminal offense under part V or VI 
29  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
     
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
of [HRS] chapter 707.” (Emphasis added.) The provision is 
ambiguous, and subject to various interpretations. The use of 
the terms “constituted or would have constituted” are both past 
tense, inferring past acts. The use of the phrase “would have 
constituted” could also be interpreted to mean that the past 
sexual acts constituted a crime when committed, but due to 
amendments or changes in HRS chapter 707, may no longer 
constitute a crime under the current Hawai‘i Penal Code. 
Alternatively, that phrase could be interpreted to mean that the 
sexual acts would have constituted a crime when committed, but 
were not actionable for some other reason, including the 
possibility that a criminal statute of limitations applied. HRS 
§ 657-1.8(a), by its plain language, is silent as to whether the 
“criminal offense” must be based on past or present criminal 
statutes. An ambiguity exists. State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai‘i 
383, 390, 219 P.3d 1170, 1177 (2009) (“[W]hen there is doubt, 
doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an 
expression used in a statute, an ambiguity exists.” (citation 
omitted)). Thus, we again look to the context of the statute 
and its legislative history, this time for guidance as to the 
ambiguous provision. See id. 
As noted above, at the time of its adoption, the 
legislature stated that the purpose and intent of HRS § 657-1.8 
was “to provide victims of sexual abuse a fair chance to bring a 
30  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
  
  
   
  
   
 
 
   
  
  
   
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
civil action against an individual or entity” by “extend[ing] 
the statute of limitations . . . to allow individuals subjected 
to sexual offenses as a minor to bring a civil action against 
the individual who committed the offense.” S. Stand. Comm. Rep. 
No. 2473, in 2012 Senate Journal, at 1033 (emphasis added). We 
read this as a legislative intent to allow civil actions for 
sexual offenses committed when the victim was a minor, in other 
words, offenses at that time. 
In 2014, HRS § 657-1.8 was amended via Act 112, in 
part, to further extend the statute of limitations period for 
victims of child sexual abuse to file claims. 2014 Haw. Sess. 
Laws Act 112, § 1 at 319-20; see Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 44-14, in 
2014 Senate Journal, at 706. The legislative history indicates 
that there were no proposed amendments or actions related to the 
contested portion of HRS § 657-1.8(a). 
We thus hold that the criminal statutes in effect when 
the alleged conduct occurred are the statutes that should 
determine if the alleged sexual abuse of a minor constituted 
criminal offenses. Here, over Defendant’s objection, the 
Circuit Court instructed the jury on criminal statutes in place 
when the complaint was filed. We conclude those instructions 
were in error. Rather, applying the criminal statutes that were 
in effect at the time the alleged acts occurred is consistent 
with both the plain language and legislative intent of the 
31  
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
  
  
 
  
   
   
 
   
    
     
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
statute. It is also consistent with this court’s treatment of 
criminal actions. We have noted that “a crime or offense is 
governed by the law existing at the time it was committed.” 
Schwartz v. State, 136 Hawai‘i 258, 275 n.30, 361 P.3d 1161, 1178 
n.30 (2015). 
Moreover, our interpretation is consistent with 
another jurisdiction that addressed a similar challenge to a 
statute of limitations provision applicable to claims stemming 
from childhood sexual abuse. In Sheehan v. Oblates of St. 
Francis de Sales, 15 A.3d 1247 (Del. 2011), the Delaware Supreme 
Court, inter alia, interpreted the Child Victim’s Act (CVA), 
which was a Delaware law that “abolished the civil statute of 
limitations for claims of childhood sexual abuse and created a 
two year window to allow victims of childhood sexual abuse to 
bring civil suits that the statute of limitations previously 
barred.” Id. at 1251. In that case, the challenged portion of 
the CVA stated: “[a] civil cause of action for sexual abuse 
shall be based upon sexual acts that would constitute a criminal 
offense under the Delaware Code.” Id. at 1257. The trial court 
ruled that, for civil claims under the challenged portion of the 
CVA, the Delaware criminal code to be applied was the criminal 
code in existence when the alleged abuse occurred. Id. 
Following trial, the jury found in favor of the institutional 
defendants. Id. at 1251. The plaintiff subsequently appealed, 
32  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
asserting, inter alia, that the trial court erred in its 
interpretation and application of the challenged portion of the 
CVA.   See  id.  at 1253.  
On appeal, the Supreme Court of Delaware held that the 
trial court properly determined that the applicable criminal 
code was the one in effect when the alleged abuse occurred. Id.  
at 1257-58. The court reasoned:  
A sexual crime is a predicate element to a civil claim 
against an institutional defendant for grossly negligently 
failing to protect a plaintiff from sexual criminal acts of 
its employee or agent. Moreover, fundamental due process 
dictates that the scope of liability imposed by a 
retroactive law cannot substantially change the scope of 
liability existing at the time of the alleged abuse. 
If the current Delaware criminal code were found 
applicable, the sexual acts alleged in this case could fall 
within the definition of a criminal offense that did not 
exist at the time of the alleged abuse. . . . 
We agree that the CVA’s reference to the Criminal Code does 
not transform this civil statute into a criminal one to 
which ex post facto  analysis applies. The Act is and 
continues to be a civil statute of limitations affecting 
matters of procedure and remedy. However, an essential 
predicate to civil claims prosecuted under the CVA is a 
sexual act that would constitute a criminal offense. If an 
act was not a crime in 1962, we cannot hold the defendants 
to reasonably have been on notice of a duty to prevent the 
now criminalized act from occurring.  
Id.  at 1257-58 (emphasis added)  (footnotes omitted).  
Here, similar to the contested provision in Sheehan, 
HRS § 657-1.8(a) establishes a  statute of limitations specific 
to civil causes of action based on the sexual abuse of a minor, 
which must be based on “sexual acts that constituted  or would 
have constituted a criminal offense under part V or VI of [HRS] 
chapter 707.”   Applying criminal law that was not in effect at 
33  
 
 
 
 
  
    
 
  
  
  
 
    
 
  
  
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the time the alleged conduct occurred could improperly impose 
civil liability for conduct that was not a criminal offense when 
the acts were committed. This would conflict with our view of 
the Hawai‘i Legislature’s intent in adopting HRS § 657-1.8(a). 
Our interpretation of HRS § 657-1.8(a) is consistent with the 
Delaware Supreme Court’s interpretation of its similar law. 
Like the Delaware Supreme Court, we also conclude that under our 
interpretation of HRS § 657-1.8, there clearly is no ex post 
facto violation. 
We thus hold that the criminal statutes in effect when 
the alleged conduct occurred are the proper statutes to apply to 
determine if the alleged sexual abuse of a minor constituted a 
criminal offense under HRS § 657-1.8(a). 
B. Based on the Record as a Whole, the Circuit Court’s 
Erroneous Jury Instructions Were Harmless. 
Defendant’s argument on appeal has been that the 
Circuit Court erroneously instructed the jury on criminal 
statutes existing when the complaint was filed, rather than the 
criminal statutes existing when the alleged acts of sexual abuse 
occurred, and that HRS § 657-1.8(a) violates the ex post facto 
clause of the U.S. Constitution. Having concluded that the 
Circuit Court should have instructed the jury on criminal 
statutes existing at the time of the alleged sexual abuse in 
34  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
1975 to 1976, and that HRS § 657-1.8(a) does not violate the ex 
post facto clause, we now address the disposition for this case. 
Of note, Defendant does not challenge any other aspect 
of the jury instructions, nor any other aspect of the Circuit 
Court proceedings.   Thus, our review is limited to the contested 
jury instructions. Plaintiff argues that,  even if the Circuit 
Court erred by failing to instruct on the criminal statutes 
existing  in 1975-76, such error would be harmless because there 
was overwhelming undisputed evidence presented at trial of 
Defendant’s conduct being criminal when it occurred. Given  the 
record in this case, we agree with Plaintiff that the erroneous 
jury instructions on the criminal statutes constituted  harmless 
error.   Medeiros, 142 
Hawai‘i at 239, 418 P.3d at 580  (citation  
omitted)  (“Invalid or insufficient instructions are presumptively 
prejudicial and are grounds for vacating the verdict unless it 
affirmatively appears from the record as a whole that the error 
was harmless.”)  (emphasis added)).  
At trial, Plaintiff entered three exhibits into 
evidence, two of which are determinative. First, Plaintiff 
entered Exhibit P2, Defendant’s October 4, 2013 email to 
Plaintiff’s father, wherein Defendant admitted that he “did not 
act appropriately” with Plaintiff while residing in the father’s 
Hawai‘i home. In the email, Defendant admitted to masturbating 
in Plaintiff’s presence and asking Plaintiff “to help a little 
35  
 
 
 
 
   
     
  
  
  
  
 
  
    
 
   
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
  
   
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
and he did.” Defendant admitted that the conduct occurred “3, 
4, maybe 5 times” in “1975-1976ish[.]” Second, Plaintiff 
entered Exhibit P3, Defendant’s answers to Plaintiff’s request 
for admissions, which were signed by Defendant. Therein, 
Defendant admitted that he masturbated in front of Plaintiff and 
that Plaintiff touched Defendant’s genitals. Defendant also 
admitted that he used the email address from which Exhibit P2 
was sent. 
Defendant’s admitted conduct would have constituted a 
criminal offense under at least two criminal statutes in part V 
of HRS Chapter 707,17 which were in effect in 1975 and 1976. See 
HRS § 657-1.8(a). 
In 1972, HRS Chapter 707 included five parts. Part V 
of HRS Chapter 707 was entitled “Sexual Offenses” and included, 
inter alia, HRS § 707-736 entitled “Sexual abuse in the first 
degree,” and HRS § 707-738 entitled “Indecent exposure.” 1972 
Haw. Sess. Laws Act 9, § 1 at 91. 
HRS § 707-736 (1972) entitled “Sexual abuse in the 
first degree” provided: 
17 In 1972, the legislature recodified the Hawai‘i Penal Code as 
Title 37 via Act 9, which included a section entitled “Chapter 707 Offenses 
Against the Person[.]” 1972 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 9, § 1 at 85-92; Hawai‘i 
Revised Statutes Title 37 Hawai‘i Penal Code Special Pamphlet (1975) at 161-87 
(Special Pamphlet 1975). HRS Chapter 707 became effective on January 1, 
1973. 1972 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 9, § 1 at 142. The first full-print version 
of HRS Chapter 707 (as amended through 1975) appeared in the Special Pamphlet 
1975. Special Pamphlet 1975 at 161-87.

*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(1) A person commits the offense of sexual abuse in the 
first degree if: 
(a) He intentionally, by forcible compulsion, has sexual 
contact with another or causes another to have sexual 
contact with him; or 
(b) He intentionally has sexual contact with another 
person who is less than 14 years old or causes such a 
person to have sexual contact with him. 
(2)  Sexual abuse in the first degree is a class C felony.  
1972 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 9, § 1 at 91 (emphasis added). 
The language of HRS § 707-736 (1972) (Sexual abuse in 
the first degree) is similar to the language of HRS § 707-732 
(2014) (Sexual assault in the third degree), on which the jury 
was instructed. See  HRS § 707-732 (2014) (“A person commits the 
offense of sexual assault in the third degree if: . . . . (b) 
The person knowingly  subjects to sexual contact another person 
who is less than fourteen years old  or causes such a person to 
have sexual contact with the person[.]” (emphases added)). The 
mens rea for HRS § 707-736 (1972) is “intentional,” whereas the 
mens rea for HRS § 707-732 (2014) is “knowingly.” However, 
given Defendant’s email and his admissions, the mens rea 
distinction is not material  in this case  and the lack of a 
specific instruction on HRS § 707-736 (1972)  was harmless.     
HRS § 707-738 (1972), entitled “Indecent exposure” 
provided that: 
(1) A person commits the offense of indecent 
exposure if, with intent to arouse or gratify sexual desire 
of himself or of any person, he exposes his genitals to a 
person to whom he is not married under circumstances in 
which his conduct is likely to cause affront or alarm. 
37  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(2) Indecent exposure is a petty misdemeanor.  
1972 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 9, § 1 at 91. 
The language of HRS § 707-738 (1972) (Indecent 
exposure) is similar to the language of HRS § 707-734 (2014) 
(Indecent exposure), on which the jury was instructed. See  HRS 
§ 707-734 (2014) (“A person commits the offense of indecent 
exposure if, the person intentionally exposes the person’s 
genitals to a person to whom the person is not married under 
circumstances in which the actor’s conduct is likely to  cause 
affront.”).   HRS §  707-738  (1972)  requires  “intent to arouse or 
gratify sexual desire of himself or of any person,”  whereas the 
mens rea for HRS § 707-734 (2014) requires that the person  
“intentionally  exposes the person’s genitals[.]”   Defendant 
argues  that the lack of instruction on “intent to arouse or 
gratify sexual desire”  was reversible error  by the Circuit 
Court.  Again,  however,  given Defendant’s email and his 
admissions, the lack of an instruction on “intent to arouse or 
gratify sexual desire” is harmless  in this case. Here, the 
record is clear that  Defendant admitted to  exposing himself  to 
Plaintiff, masturbating in Plaintiff’s presence, and his email 
stated that he asked Plaintiff to help him.   See  State v. Smith, 
394 A.2d 259,  260,  262-63  (Me. 1978) (holding that although the 
trial court  failed to  properly  instruct the jury that the sexual 
 
38  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
contact was for the purpose of arousing or gratifying sexual 
desire, the court’s error was harmless because “a correct 
instruction . . . could not possibly have brought about a not 
guilty verdict” given “[t]he description given by the child 
victim as to the details of the incidents alleged to have been 
unlawful sexual contact”). 
Both HRS § 707-736 (1972) and HRS § 707-738 (1972) 
remained unamended and in effect through 1975 and 1976, during 
the period of time that Defendant’s admitted conduct occurred. 
Defendant’s email to Plaintiff’s father (Exhibit P2), 
and Defendant’s admissions (Exhibit P3), both in evidence during 
the trial, provide clear evidence that his conduct constituted 
Sexual Abuse in the First Degree under HRS § 707-736 (1972) or 
Indecent Exposure under HRS § 707-738 (1972), the criminal 
statutes that existed at the time of the alleged conduct in 1975 
to 1976. Defendant’s appeal does not dispute any evidence. 
Indeed, Defendant’s application for certiorari to this court 
states that he “admitted he masturbated in [Plaintiff’s] 
presence, and that [Plaintiff] touched [Defendant’s] genitals.” 
In light of the clear evidence supporting the jury’s 
verdict, we hold that, under the facts and circumstances of this 
case, Defendant did not suffer prejudice as a result of the 
Circuit Court’s erroneous jury instructions. The record on the 
whole demonstrates that it was not reasonably likely that a more 
39  
 
 
 
 
   
  
  
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
favorable outcome for Defendant would have resulted absent the 
error, and thus, Defendant suffered no prejudice. HRCP Rule 61 
(eff. 1980); see Kawamata Farms, Inc. v. United Agric. Prods., 
86 Hawai‘i 214, 243-44, 948 P.2d 1055, 1084-85 (1997) (affirming 
the jury’s verdict and holding that the defendants in a civil 
action did not suffer prejudice as a result of the circuit 
court’s erroneous remedial jury instruction, where, based on the 
record as a whole, it was “not reasonably likely that an outcome 
more favorable to the defendant would have resulted absent the 
error”). 
V. CONCLUSION 
Although our reasoning in this case differs from the 
ICA, we affirm the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal, which affirmed the 
Circuit Court’s Final Judgment, entered on November 28, 2018.
