OPINION OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J. 
 
I. Introduction 
 
This appeal arises from the denial without a hearing of 
Luke Warner’s (“Warner”) Hawai ʻi Rules of Penal Procedure 
(“HRPP”) Rule 40 (2006) petition for post -conviction relief.  On 
June 17, 2016, Warner pleaded guilty to multiple drug, theft, 
and firearm-related offenses.  The Circuit Court of the First Electronically Filed

 Circuit (“sentencing court”) imposed concurrent prison terms, 
the longest of which was ten years, and various monetary 
assessments. 
Warner later filed the instant pro se HRPP Rule 40 petition 
in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (“circuit court”).  He 
challenged the sentencing court’s judgment of conviction and 
sentence on eight grounds.  Warner asked the circuit court to 
end his sentence, to waive all “fines and fees,” and for 
“compensatory judgments” for civil injustices.   
The circuit court ruled Warner had waived some of the 
grounds in his petition and other grounds that requested 
compensatory relief were unavailable under HRPP Rule 40.  The 
circuit court denied Warner’s petition without a hearing and the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals (“ICA”) affirmed.  
We hold (1) there was no error in dismissing grounds one 
through five of Warner’s petition without a hearing based on 
waiver; but (2) based on the reasons discussed below, Warner 
raised a colorable claim as to the monetary assessments, which 
constitute fines; and (3) pursuant to HRPP Rule 40(c)(3), 
grounds six through eight of Warner’s petition raised civil 
claims required to be transferred for disposition under the 
civil rules.   
We therefore vacate in part the ICA’s June 9, 2021 judgment 
on appeal and the circuit court’s February 1, 2019 order denying *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 Warner’s petition without a hearing, and remand to the circuit 
court for further proceedings consistent wi
th this opinion. 
II. Background  
A. Sentencing court proceedings 
 
1. Indictment and guilty plea 
 
On August 8, 2012, a grand jury charged Warner with four 
counts of attempted theft in the second degree, three counts of 
methamphetamine trafficking in the first degree, and one count 
each of seven other theft, firearm, and drug- related charges.  
At a Marc h 23, 2015 change of plea hearing,1 the State 
amended down the methamphetamine trafficking charges to second 
degree charges.  In exchange, Warner pleaded guilty to all 
charges and agreed to serve concurrent terms of incarceration, 
with the longest term bei ng ten years.  Warner’s attorney stated 
he had “gone over [the guilty plea] with [Warner],” and that he 
and Warner had signed the plea.   
Before accepting the plea, the sentencing court conducted a 
colloquy with Warner.  In summary, the court explained the 
charges, the maximum terms of imprisonment, and that Warner 
would give up his right to trial, including his right to jury 
trial, by pleading guilty.  The sentencing court also explained 
the maximum “authorized fines” that could be imposed pursuant to

 Hawai
ʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) § 706- 640 for the various counts 
to which he was to plead guilty.  However, the sentencing court 
did not mention or inform Warner about any other potential 
monetary assessments.  Warner indicated his mind was clear, he 
had talked to his lawyer about whether he should go to trial, he 
was satisfied with his lawyer’s advice, and no one was forcing 
or threatening him to plead guilty.   
On June 17, 2016, the sentencing court entered its judgment 
of conviction and sentence.  Warner was sentenced to concurrent 
terms of imprisonment; the longest term was ten years and all 
terms were to run concurrently with any other sentence.2  No HRS 
§ 706-640 fines were imposed, but Warner was ordered to pay a 
$1,420 crime victim compensation fund fee, $1,420 for a drug 
demand reduction assessment, $7,500 for methamphetamine 
trafficking restitution and reimbursement, and a fee of up to 
$500 for a DNA analysis.  The sentencing court did not make 
findings regarding Warner’s ability to pay any of these amounts , 
whether then or in the future.   
 
 
 
 
                                                 
2  In March 2015, Warner was also sentenced to ten -year sentences of 
imprisonment in federal and Maryland cases.

 2. HRPP Rule 40 petition 
 
 On February 5, 2018, Warner filed an HRPP Rule 40 petition 
challenging the sentencing court’s judgment on eight grounds:  
(1) use of evidence obtained pursuant to an unconstitutional 
search and seizure; (2) use of evidence obtained pursuant to an 
unlawful arrest; (3) prosecution’s failure to disclose to the 
defendant evidence that is favorable to the defendant; (4) 
ineffective assistance of counsel; (5) prosecutorial misconduct; 
(6) “medical and psych decompensation”; (7) “discrimination and 
reverse racism”; and (8) “accumulative errors.”  
Warner indicated he was raising these grounds for the first 
time because his attorneys were allegedly negligent, committed 
misconduct, and corrupt.  Warner also claimed his health had 
been poor, he had been preoccupied with other cases, and he had 
been transferred from several prisons.   Warner asked the circuit 
court to end his sentence, to waive all fines and fees, and for 
“compensatory judgments” for his ci vil injustices, medical 
decompensation, and financial losses.   
In response, the State argued Warner waived grounds one 
through four because he failed to raise them before his guilty 
plea, and he did not prove extraordinary circumstances 
justifying his failure to do so.  With respect to ground four, 
ineffective assistance of counsel, the State also argued Warner 
failed to provide specific errors or omissions that resulted in *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
6 
 the withdrawal or substantial impairment of a potentially 
meritorious defense.  The State argued grounds six through 
eight, which sought compensatory relief, were beyond the scope 
of HRPP Rule 40.  The State asserted Warner therefore failed to 
state a colorable claim.   
 On February 1, 2019, the circuit court3 entered its findings 
of fact, conclusions of law, and order denying the petition 
without a hearing.  The circuit court concluded (1)(a) Warner 
waived grounds one through four by failing to raise them before 
pleading guilty;  and (b) ground four, ineffective assistance of 
counsel, was also without merit because Warner did not state 
specific errors or omissions of counsel resulting in the 
withdrawal or impairment of a meritorious defense; (2) ground 
five, prosecutorial misconduct, was without merit because none 
of the named individuals were employed by the State; and (3) 
grounds six through eight were without merit because HRPP Rule 
40 did not provide for compensatory relief.  The circuit court 
did not address Warner’s request to waive the “fines and fees.”  
Warner appealed.

 B. ICA proceedings 
 
1. Warner’s opening brief  
 
In summary, Warner alleged his trial counsel committed 
misconduct by refusing his instructions to challenge 
inconsistencies in discovery and by “framing” him in his federal 
case.  Warner claimed HPD officers lied about their first 
meetings with him, omitted the fact that the first search 
warrant listed an incorrect address, and lied about a pistol 
that was sold to Warner.  Warner also asked the ICA to suspend 
multiple Hawai
ʻi judges “for abusing their discretion to deny 
[Warner] effective counsel[.]”   
2. The State’s answering brief  
 
The State maintained Warner’s petition failed to state a 
colorable claim of relief, that he waived grounds one through 
four, and the relief sought in grounds five through eight was 
beyond the scope of HRPP Rule 40.   
3. Summary Disposition Order 
 
On May 21, 2021, the ICA issued its summary disposition 
order (“SDO”) affirming the circuit court’s February 1, 2019 
order denying the petition without a hearing.  Warner v. State, 
CAAP-19-0000034 (App. May 21, 2019) (SDO).  The ICA identified 
two arguments in Warner’s briefs as related to grounds one 
through four of his petition:  (1) that grand jury witnesses 
lied; and (2) his trial counsel engaged in various acts of *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
8 misconduct, including ineffective assistance of counsel.  
Warner, SDO at 4.  The ICA deemed these arguments waived under 
HRPP Rule 40(a)(3) because Warner could have raised them before 
his guilty plea and because he had not proven extraordinary 
circumstances justifying his failure to do so.  Warner, SDO at 
5, 7.  The ICA also determined that, to the extent Warner’s 
petition challenged his guilty plea as not knowingly and 
intelligently made, Warner had not stated a colorable claim.  
Warner, SDO at 6.  
The ICA also held Warner’s briefs presented no discernible 
argument regarding grounds five through eight of the petition, 
and any related points of error were waived under Hawai ʻi Rules 
of Appellate Procedure (“HRAP”) Rule 28(b)(4), (7) (2016).4  
Warner, SDO at 5 n.5.  The ICA thus affirmed the circuit court’s 
February 1, 2019 order denying the petition without a hearing.  
Warner, SDO at 8. 
III. Standards of Review
A. Post -conviction relief
We review orders denying HRPP Rule 40 petitions for post -
conviction relief de novo.  Lewi v. State , 145 Hawai ʻi 333, 345, 
4HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) provides, in relevant part:  “Points not presented 
[in the opening brief] in accordance with this section will be disregarded, 
except that the appellate court, at its option, may notice a plain error not 
presented.” 
HRAP Rule 28(b)(7) provides, in relevant part:  “Points not argued may 
be deemed waived.” *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
9 452 P.3d 330, 342 (2019).  As a general rule, a hearing should 
be held on a Rule 40 petition if it states a colorable claim; 
“the question on appeal of a denial of a Rule 40 petition 
without a hearing is whether the trial record indicates that 
Petitioner’s application for relief made such a showing of a 
colorable claim as to require a hearing before the lower court.”   
Lewi, 145 Hawaiʻ i at 345, 452 P.3d at 342 (quoting Dan v. State , 
76 Hawai ʻi 423, 427, 879 P.2d 528, 532 (1994)).  
B. Pro se litigants
“A fundamental tenet of Hawai ʻi law is that ‘[p]leadings
prepared by pro se litigants should be interpreted liberally.’”  
Waltrip v. TS Enters., Inc., 140 
Hawaiʻi 226, 239, 398 P.3d 815, 
828 (2016) (quoting Dupree v. Hiraga, 121 Hawaiʻi 297, 314, 219 
P.3d 1084, 1101 (2009)).  “The underpinnings of this tenet rest 
on the promotion of equal access to justice — a pro se litigant 
should not be prevented from proceeding on a pleading or letter 
to an agency if a reasonable, liberal construction of the 
document would permit [them] to do so.”  Waltrip, 140 Hawaiʻi at 
239, 398 P.3d at 828. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

  IV. Discussion  
A. Denial of HRPP Rule 40 petition without a hearing 
 
1. Grounds one through five were properly denied without 
a hearing 
 
The ICA did not err by holding Warner waived grounds one 
through four of his petition by failing to raise the arguments 
before his guilty plea.  Warner , SDO at 5, 7.   See HRPP Rule 
40(a)(3).5  The ICA also did not err in determining Warner 
provided no argument as to ground five, and that this issue was 
also therefore waived pursuant to HRAP Rule 28(b)(4), (7).6  
Warner, SDO at 5 n.5.    
2. Warner asserted a colorable claim regarding monetary 
assessments 
 
Warner’s petition also requested the circuit court “waive 
all of the fines and fees that were imposed at sentencing[.]”  
                                                 
5  HRPP Rule 40(a)(3) provides: 
Inapplicability.  Rule 40 proceedings shall not be 
available and relief thereunder  shall not be granted where 
the issues sought to be raised have been previously ruled 
upon or were waived.  Except for a claim of illegal 
sentence, an issue is waived if the petitioner knowingly 
and understandingly failed to raise it and it could have 
been raised before the trial,  at the trial, on appeal, in a 
habeas corpus proceeding or any other proceeding actually 
conducted, or in a prior proceeding actually initiated 
under this rule, and the petitioner is unable to prove the 
existence of extraordinary circumstances to justify the 
petitioner’s failure to raise the issue.   There is a 
rebuttable presumption that a failure to appeal a ruling or 
to raise an issue is a knowing and understanding failure.  
 
6  HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) requires a concise statement of points of error.  
HRAP 28(b)(7) provides that points not argued may be deemed waived.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 Warner’s sentence did not include any HRS § 706 -640 fines.  In 
State v. Yamashita, however, we recently held that the crime 
victim compensation fee and the drug demand reduction assessment 
constitute criminal fines (and not unconstitutional taxes, as 
asserted).  151 Hawai ʻi 390, 400, 515 P.3d 207, 217 (2022).    
Hence, the additional monetary assessments against Warner are 
all criminal fines and Warner challenged all the fines in his 
sentence:  $1,420 in crime victim compensation fees, the $1,420 
drug demand reduction assessment, $7,500 for methamphetamine 
trafficking restitution and reimbursement, and the assessment of 
up to $500 to the DNA registry special fund for the cost of a 
DNA analysis.    
a. Failure of sentencing court to advise Warner of 
possible monetary assessments before accepting 
the change of plea 
 
The sentencing court did not inform Warner of any of the 
monetary assessments it imposed before accepting Warner’s change 
of plea. 
 HRPP Rule 11(c)(2) requires that, before accepting a plea, 
courts ensure defendants understand various matters, including 
“the maximum penalty provided by law . . . which may be imposed 
for the offense to which the plea is offered[.]”  In State v. 
Kealoha, we stated:  
[W]e hold that because restitution is part of the “maximum 
penalty provided by law” and is a direct consequence of 
conviction, defendants must be appropriately advised and *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
12 
 questioned in open court regarding their understanding of 
this possibility before a court can accept their pleas.  
 
142 Hawaiʻ i 46, 50, 414 P.3d 98, 102 (2018).  We noted that 
restitution, like imprisonment, fees, and fines, can only be 
imposed upon conviction, and is a direct consequence of 
conviction and a part of the sentence.  142 Hawaiʻi at 60-61, 414 
P.3d at 112-13.  And pursuant to Yamashita, all of the monetary 
assessments imposed on Warner constitute fines.  151 Hawai ʻi at 
400, 515 P.3d at 217.  Hence, the sentencing court did not 
fulfill its advisement obligation before accept ing Warner’s 
plea. 
 With respect to a remedy for the failure to advise, Kealoha 
had requested a resentencing without the restitution, or in the 
alternative, to allow withdrawal of his guilty plea.  Kealoha , 
142 Hawaiʻ i at 62, 414 P.3d at 114.  We noted that HRS § 706-
646(2) did not allow for resentencing without restitution to the 
victim being ordered, as restitution in that case was requested 
by the victim, and was reasonable and verifiable.  142 Hawaiʻi at 
62, 414 P.3d at 114.  We also stated: 
Although th e circuit court did not conduct a proper 
colloquy in Kealoha’s case, because Kealoha never filed an 
appropriate motion in the circuit court, we affirm his 
convictions without prejudice to him filing a HRPP Rule 40 
petition in the circuit court.  
 
142 Hawaiʻ i at 50, 414 P.3d at 102.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
13 
 . . . .  In contrast, Warner has already filed this HRPP Rule 40 
petition requesting a waiver of all fees and fines.  Thus, 
Warner stated a colorable claim as to his request that the 
monetary assessments, which constitute fines, be set aside based 
on the sentencing court’s failure to advise him of them before 
accepting his plea.  Hence, the ICA erred by determining that, 
to the extent Warner’s petition challenged his guilty plea as 
not knowingly and intelligently made, Warner had not stated a 
colorable claim.  Warner , SDO at 6.  
b. Failure of sentencing court to address ability to 
pay 
 
The sentencing court made no findings regarding Warner’s 
ability to pay before including the monetary assessments as part 
of the sentence, whether then or in the future.  Whether a 
defendant has the financial ability to pay is relevant and 
important.  Subsection (4) of HRS § 706- 6447 allows for unpaid 
                                                 
7  HRS § 706- 644 (2014 & Supp. 2021) provides in relevant part:  
 
§706-644 Consequences of nonpayment; imprisonment for 
contumacious nonpayment; summary collection.  (1) When a 
defendant is sentenced . . . and the defendant is ordered 
to pay a fee, fine, or restitution . . . and the defendant 
defaults in the payment thereof  . . .  , the court . . . 
may require the defendant to show cause why the defendant's 
default should not be treated as contumacious . . . . 
Unless the defendant shows that the defendant’s default was 
not attributable to an intentional refusal to obey the 
order of the court, or to a failure on the defendant’s part 
to make a good faith effort to obtain the funds required 
for the payment, the court shall find that the defendant's 
default was contumacious and may order the defendant 
committed until the fee, fine, restitution, or a specified 
part thereof is paid.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
14 
 fees and fines to be forgiven if the failure to pay is not 
contumacious.  Subsection (3) of HRS § 706- 6448 allows for unpaid 
fees, fines, or restitution to be converted into prison 
sentences, but the incarceration of a defendant solely on the 
basis of inability to pay is unconstitutional.  State v. 
Huggett, 55 Haw. 632, 638, 525 P.2d 1119, 1124 (1974)9 (citing 
State v. Tackett, 52 Haw. 601, 483 P.2d 191 (1971)).   
We have also held that a statute providing discretion to 
waive or reduce litigation expenses payable by those charged 
with crimes requires a determination regarding the defendant’s 
financial ability to pay.  Arnold v. Higa, 61 Haw. 203, 206, 600 
                                                 
(3) The term of imprisonment for nonpayment of fee, fine, 
or restitution shall be specified in the order of 
commitment, and shall not exceed one day for each $250 of 
the fee or fine, thirty days if the fee or fine was imposed 
upon conviction of a violation or a petty misdemeanor, or 
one year in any other case, whichever is the shorter 
period. A person committed for nonpayment of a fee or fine 
shall be given credit toward payment of the fee or fine for 
each day of imprisonment, at the rate of $250 per day.  
(4) If it appears that the defendant’s default in the 
payment of a fee, fine, or restitution is not contumacious, 
the court may make an order allowing the defendant 
additional time for payment, reducing the amount of each 
installment, or revoking the fee, fine, or the unpaid 
portion thereof in whole or in part, or converting the 
unpaid portion of the fee or fine to community service. A 
defendant shall not be discharged from an order to pay 
restitution until the full amount of the restitution has 
actually been collected or accounted for.  
. . . . 
 
8  See supra note 7. 
 
9  The United States Supreme Court has also held that courts may not 
incarcerate a person for nonpayment of a fine or restitution without a 
hearing on ability to pay and a finding that the failure to pay was willful.  
Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S 660, 667 -69 (1983).  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
15 
  P.2d 1383, 1384 (1979) (“[A] determination [of] whether [a 
defendant] could afford additional litigation expenses should 
have been made.”).  
As explained below, Warner therefore also stated a 
colorable claim reg
arding his request to waive all monetary 
penalties because the sentencing court did not address his 
ability to pay. 
(i) Crime victim compensation fees 
The sentencing court had ordered Warner to pay $1,420 in 
crime victim compensation (“CVC”) fees.  In Yamashita, we also 
held that the imposition of CVC fees requires a determination of 
a defendant’s present ability to pay those fees at the time of 
sentencing.  151 Hawai ʻi at 398, 515 P.3d at 215.   We held the 
legislative history of HRS §§ 706-605(6)10 and 351-62.6(a)11 
                                                 
10  HRS § 706- 605(6) (Supp. 2016) provides:  
 
The court shall impose a compensation fee upon every person 
convicted of a criminal offense pursuant to section 351 -
62.6; provided that the court shall waive the imposition of 
a compensation fee if it finds that the defendant is unable 
to pay the compensation fee.  When a defendant is ordered 
to make payments in addition to the compensation  fee, 
payments by the defendant shall be made in the order of 
priority established in section 706 -651.  
 
11  HRS § 351- 62.6(a) (Supp. 2005) provides:  
 
The court shall impose a compensation fee upon every 
defendant who has been convicted or who has entered a plea 
under section 853 -
1 and who is or will be able to pay the 
compensation fee.  The amount of the compensation fee shall 
be commensurate with the seriousness of the offense as 
follows: *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
16 
 indicates “the guiding inquiry in imposing a CVC fee is whether 
the defendant is presently able  to pay such a fee.”  151 Hawaiʻi 
at 398, 515 P.3d at 215 (emphasis in original).  We held the CVC 
fee should not have been imposed because the trial co urt’s 
findings only “bore on [the defendant’s] future, not present, 
ability to pay the fee.”  151 Hawaiʻi at 399, 515 P.3d at 216.  
Hence, Yamashita’s present inability to pay the CVC fee mandated 
waiver of the fee.  151 Hawaiʻi at 399, 515 P.3d at 216. 
Here, the sentencing court imposed a $1,420 CVC fee without 
making any findings as to Warner’s present ability to pay.  
Thus, pursuant to Yamashita , Warner stated a colorable claim as 
to the CVC fee for this reason also.  
(ii) Drug demand reduction assessment  
The sentencing court also ordered Warner to pay a $1,420 
drug demand reduction assessment (“DDRA”).  HRS § 706-65012 
                                                 
(1) Not less than $105 nor more than $505 for a 
felony; 
(2) $55 for a misdemeanor; and  
(3) $30 for a petty misdemeanor.  
 
The compensation fee shall be separate from any fine that 
may be imposed under section 706 -640 and shall be in 
addition to any other disposition under this chapter;  
provided that the court shall waive the imposition of a 
compensation fee if the defendant is unable to pay the 
compensation fee.  Moneys from the compensation fees shall 
be deposited into the crime victim compensation special 
fund under section 351- 62.5. 
 
12  HRS § 706- 650 (Supp. 2016) provides, in relevant part:  
 
(1) In addition to any disposition authorized by chapter 
706 or 853, any person who is:  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
17 
  requires a court to impose the DDRA for drug and intoxicating 
compound convictions.  The statute explicitly allows the court 
to waive or reduce the amount, however, if the defendant lacks 
the financial ability to pay all or part of it.  See  HRS § 706-
650(5).   
 When a statute provides a court with discretion to waive or 
reduce expenses that must be paid, the court must make a 
determination of the defendant’s financial ability to pay.  
Arnold, 61 Haw. at 206, 600 P.2d at 1384.  The sentencing court  
made no findings regarding Warner’s ability to pay the DDRA.  
Warner therefore also stated a colorable claim regarding the 
DDRA for this reason.  
                                                 
(a) Convicted of an offense under part IV of 
chapter 712, except sections 712 -1250.5 and 
712-1257; 
. . . . 
shall be ordered to pay a monetary assessment under 
subsection (2), except as provided under subsection (5).  
(2) Monetary assessments for individuals subject to 
subsection (1) shall not exceed the following:  
. . . . 
(b) $2,000 when the offense is a class B felony;  
. . . . 
(5) If the court determines that the person has  the ability 
to pay the monetary assessment and is eligible for 
probation or will not be sentenced to incarceration, unless 
otherwise required by law, the court may order the person 
to undergo a substance abuse treatment program at the 
person’s expense.  I f the person undergoes a substance 
abuse treatment program at the person’s expense, the court 
may waive or reduce the amount of the monetary 
assessment.   Upon a showing by the person that the person 
lacks the financial ability to pay all or part of the 
monetary assessment, the court may waive or reduce the 
amount of the monetary assessment.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

  (iii) Methamphetamine trafficking restitution and 
reimbursement
 
 
The sentencing court also sentenced Warner to pay $7,500 as 
methamphetamine trafficking restitution and reimbursement 
(“MTRR”).  HRS § 712-1240.9,13 however, provides courts with 
discretion regarding whether to order MTRR for methamphetamine 
trafficking convictions.14  Again, when a statute provides a 
court with discretion to waive or reduce expenses that must be 
paid, the court must make a determination of the defendant’s 
financial ability to pay.  Arnold , 61 Haw. at 206, 600 P.2d at 
                                                 
13  HRS § 712- 1240.9 (2014) provided:  
 
 When sentencing a defendant convicted of 
methamphetamine trafficking pursuant to section 712 -1240.7 
or 712-1240.8, the court may order restitution or 
reimbursement to the State or appropriate county government 
for the cost incurred for any cleanup associated with the 
manufacture or distribution of methamphetamine and to any 
other person injured as a result of the manufacture or 
distribution of methamphetamine.  
 
 As discussed, Warner pleaded guilty to three counts amended to 
methamphetamine trafficking in the second degree, pursuant to HRS § 712 -
1240.8 (repealed 2016).  At the time of sentencing, HRS § 712 -1240.8 
provided, in relevant  part: 
 
(2) Methamphetamine trafficking in the second degree is a 
class B felony for which the defendant shall be sentenced 
as provided in subsection (3).  
(3) Notwithstanding sections 706 –620, 706– 640, 706– 641, 
706–660, 706 –669, and any other law to the contrary, a 
person convicted of methamphetamine trafficking in the 
second degree shall be sentenced to an indeterminate term 
of imprisonment of ten years with a mandatory minimum term 
of imprisonment of not less than one year and not greater 
than four years and a fine not to exceed $10,000,000[.]  
 
14  The MTRR is characterized as “restitution or reimbursement” payable to 
the State or a county.  HRS § 706 -644(4), supra n.7, treats restitution 
differently from fees or fines; fees or fines can be forgiven or converted to 
community service, but restitution cannot be forgiven.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
19 
  1384.  Warner therefore also stated a colorable claim regarding 
the MTRR on this basis.
 
(iv) DNA analysis assessment 
The circuit court also sentenced Warner to pay up to $50 0 
for the actual cost of a DNA analysis (“DAA”) to the DNA 
registry special fund, pursuant to HRS § 706-603.15  The statute, 
however, provides that courts “may” reduce the assessment amount 
if the court finds the defendant “is not and will not be able to 
pay the full monetary assessment.”  But upon such a finding, the 
court “shall instead order the defendant to pay an assessment 
that the defendant will be able to pay within five years.”  HRS 
§ 706-603.   
No findings were made regarding Warner’s ability to pa y the 
DAA at the time of sentencing or within five years thereafter.  
Therefore, Warner stated a colorable claim regarding the DAA for 
this reason as well.  See  Arnold, 61 Haw. at 206, 600 P.2d at 
1384.  
                                                 
15  HRS § 706- 603(1) (2014) provides:  
 
In addition to any disposition authorized by chapter 706 or 
853, every defendant convicted of a felony offense shall be 
ordered to pay a monetary assessment of $500 or the actual 
cost of the DNA analysis, whichever is less.  The court may 
reduce the monetary assessment if the court finds, based on 
evidence presented by the defendant and not rebutted by the 
State, that the defendant is not and will not be able to 
pay the full monetary assessment and, based on the finding, 
shall instead order the defendant to pay an assessment that 
the defendant will be able to pay within five years.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
20 
 Thus, Warner raised a colorable claim as to his request 
that the circuit court “waive all fines and fees that were 
imposed at sentencing.”  O n remand, he is entitled to 
appointment of counsel and a hearing on this request.16 
3. Grounds six through eight should have been transferred 
for disposition under the civil rules pursuant to HRPP 
Rule 40(c)(3) 
 
 The circuit court concluded grounds six through eight were 
without merit because they sought compensatory relief not 
available under HRPP Rule 40.  HRPP Rule 40(c)(3), however, 
provides:  
If a post -conviction petition alleges neither illegality of 
judgment nor illegality of post -conviction “custody” or 
“restraint”  but instead alleges a cause of action based on 
a civil rights statute or other separate cause of action, 
the court shall treat the pleading as a civil complaint not 
governed by this rule .  However, where a petition seeks 
relief of the nature provided by this rule and 
simultaneously pleads a separate claim or claims under a 
civil rights statute or other separate cause of action, the 
latter claim or claims  shall be ordered transferred by the 
court for disposition under the civil rules . 
 
(Emphasis added.)  Thus, civil claims included in HRPP Rule 40 
petitions must be transferred for disposition under civil rules.   
                                                 
16  HRPP Rule 40(f) provides, in relevant part:  
 
If a petition alleges facts  that if proven would entitle 
the petitioner to relief, the court shall grant a hearing 
which may extend only to the issues raised in the petition 
or answer.  However, the court may deny a hearing if the 
petitioner’s claim is patently frivolous and is with out 
trace of support either in the record or from other 
evidence submitted by the petitioner.  The court may also 
deny a hearing on a specific question of fact when a full 
and fair evidentiary hearing upon that question was held 
during the course of the proceedings which led to the 
judgment or custody which is the subject of the petition or 
at any later proceeding.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
21 
  The ICA held that Warner provided no argument as to 
grounds six through eight of his petition and that those issues 
were waived pursuant to HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) and (7).  Warner , SDO 
at 5 n.5.  Not only are pleadings prepared by pro se litigants 
to be interpreted liberally, Waltrip, 140 Hawai ʻi a
t 239, 398 
P.3d at 828, but Warner’s petition also actually states civil 
claims.   
 In ground six, “Medical and Psych decompensation,” Warner 
alleged, “[d]uring the processing of this case and my 
cooperation efforts with law enforcement my medical and psych 
conditions suffered decompensation from healthy stable to 
serious and potentially critical disorders and injuries.”   
In ground seven, “Discrimination and reverse racism,” 
Warner alleged, “I was targeted and treated with deliberate 
indifference and corrupt profiling by Hawaii Officials and 
professionals [in part] because I am Haole and did not pay HPD 
and Sheriffs protection money. . . .”   
 In ground eight, “Accumulative errors,” Warner alleged 
“[The pathology of all the above, and then some,],” and said 
“Please see ‘Accumulative Errors:  Defendant Petitioner’s 
Annotated List of Facts, Occurrences, Circumstances, 
Coincidences’ with its Exhibits 01 to 14, attached hereto.”  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
22 
  Exhibits 01 to 14, in turn, reflected numerous and varied civil 
claims involving many institutions and individuals.17   
 Warner’s petition asked the circuit court not only to end 
his sentence, but also to evaluate his “ civil injustices, 
medical decompensation, and material and financial losses, and 
make compensatory judgements.”  (Emphasis a dded.)  The petition 
sought “relief of the nature provided by [HRPP Rule 40]” and 
pleaded “a separate claim or claims under a . . . separate cause 
of action[.]”  HRPP Rule 40(c)(3).  Hence, Warner’s claims in 
grounds six through eight should have been “ord ered transferred 
by the court for disposition under the civil rules.”  HRPP Rule 
40(c)(3); see also Hutch v. State, 107 Hawai ʻi  411, 420, 114 P.3d 
917, 926 (2005).  Grounds six through eight should then be 
treated as any other civil complaint subject to “t he civil 
rules,” which include the Hawaiʻi Rules of Civil Procedure and 
applicable rules in the Rules of the Circuit Courts of the State 
of Hawaiʻ i.   
V. Conclusion 
For these reasons, we hold (1) there was no error in 
dismissing grounds one through five of Warner’s Rule 40 petition 
                                                 
17  Grounds six through eight contain myriad complaints, some of which have 
no connection to Hawai ʻi, but do include some personal injury and civil rights 
claims.  For example, Warner alleges he suffered a broken left ankle during 
his arrest in Honolulu, negligent treatment for a leg laceration injury, and 
inadequate medical treatment while incarcerated.  
We of course express no 
opinion as to the merits of any of the complaints.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
 
23 
       /s/ Michael D. Wilson without a hearing; but (2) Warner raised a colorable claim as to 
the monetary assessments in his sentence, which constitute 
fines; and (3) grounds six through eight raised civil claims 
required to be transferred for disposition under civil rules 
pursuant to HRPP Rule 40(c)(3).  
 
We therefore vacate in part the ICA’s June 9, 2021 judgment 
on appeal and the circuit court’s February 1, 2019 ord er denying 
Warner’s petition without a hearing, and remand to the circuit 
court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
