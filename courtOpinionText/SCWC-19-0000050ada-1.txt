 I.  Introduction  
 
 This certiorari proceeding arises out of t he Intermediate 
Court of Appeals ’ (“ICA”) dismissal of a January 23, 2019 appeal 
filed by Christy Tigilau (“Tigilau”).  Tigilau  appealed a 
judgment and writ of possession filed on January 10, 2019 by the 
District Court of the First Circuit,  Waiʻanae Division (“district 
court”) in an ejectment case.1 
 Pursuant to Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (“HRS”) § 607 -3 (2016), 
Hawaiʻi state courts have discretionary power to waive the 
prepayment of court costs where payment appears onerous.2  Court 
rules also provide judges with discretion to waive costs, 
 
1  According to Queen Emma Found. v. Tingco , 74 Haw. 294,  300 n.5, 845 
P.2d 1186, 1189 n.5 (1992):  
  
Ejectment  is a common law action once used to recover 
possession of land and for damages for the unlawful 
detention of its possession.  The lessor or real party in 
interest had to establish title in order to warrant 
recovery.  The common law action for  ejectment has been 
modified by statute in many states and may come under the 
title of action for summary process, action for eviction, 
or forcible entry and detainer actions.   See Black’s Law 
Dictionary  516 (6th ed. 1990).  
 
74 Haw. at 300 n.5, 845 P.2d at 1189 n.5.  According to Hawaiʻi Revised 
Statutes § 604 -6 (2016), district courts have jurisdiction over ejectment 
proceedings where title to real estate does not come in question.   
 
2  HRS § 607 -3 (2016) states, “ The judges  of all the courts of the State 
shall have discretionary power to waive the prepayment of  costs or to reduce 
or remit  costs where, in special or extraordinary cases, the cost of any 
suit, action, or proceeding may, to the judges, appear  onerous.”

 including  Hawaiʻi Rules of Appe llate Procedure Rule (“HRAP”) Rule 
24 (2016),3 which provides in relevant part as follows:  
(a) Leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis  from 
the . . . d istrict . . .  court  . . . to the Hawaiʻi 
appellate courts.  A motion for leave to proceed on 
appeal in forma pauperis  from the . . . district  . . . 
court . . . shall ordinarily be made in the first instance 
to the court . . . appealed from.  
 
A party to an action in the . . . district . . .  
court . . . who desires to proceed on appeal  in forma 
pauperis  may file in the appellate court a motion for leave 
to so proceed.  The motion shall be accompanied by an 
affidavit or declaration, showing, in the detail prescribed 
by Form 4 of the Appendix of Forms, the party ’s inability 
to pay the required fili ng fees or to give security for 
costs, the party ’s belief that [the party] i s entitled to 
redress, and a statement of the issues that the party 
intends to present on appeal.  If the appeal is from a 
court, the motion shall show that application to the cour t 
appealed from for the relief sought is not 
practicable  . . . . 
 
. . . . 
 
(c) Effect of denial of motion for leave to proceed in 
forma pauperis.   If the motion to proceed in forma pauperis  
is denied the movant shall, within 10 days after the denial 
of such a motion, pay all unpaid filing fees and shall give 
security for costs.  Failure of the unsuccessful movant to 
pay the unpaid filing fees or to give security for costs 
shall not affect the validity of the appeal, but is ground 
for such action as the appe llate court having jurisdiction 
over the appeal deems appropriate, and may include 
dismissal of the appeal.  
 
 Tigilau filed two motions to proceed in forma pauperis  
(“IFP”) on appeal  to the ICA .  The first motion provided little 
information regarding Tigilau ’s financial status, but the second 
 
3  Other rules include Rule 2.2(19) (2013) of the Rules of the Circuit 
Courts of the State of Hawaiʻi and Rule 2.2(13) (2013) of the Rules of the 
District Courts of the State of Hawaiʻi, which both provide in part that 
“[t]he court may waive costs and fees fo r good cause shown.”  **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
4 
 motion provided much greater detail.  In denying both motions, 
the ICA ordered Tigilau to follow the portion of HRAP Rule 24(a) 
stating that “[a] motion for l eave to proceed on appeal [IFP]   
. . . shall ordinarily be made in the first instance to the 
court . . . appealed from.”   The ICA ordered Tigilau to either 
file an IFP motion in the district court within ten days or pay 
the filing fees in full.   The ICA a lso did not address whether 
requiring Tigilau to pay the filing fees would be onerous under 
HRS § 607-3.  After Tigilau did not file an IFP motion or pay 
filing fees within ten days of  the second order, on June 20, 
2019, the ICA dismissed Tigilau’s appeal on that basis.    
 Tigilau is a self -represented defendant appealing a writ of 
possession in a residential ejectment case.  We hold that , under 
the circumstances, the ICA abused its discretion in ordering 
Tigilau to file IFP motions in the district court, in denying 
Tigilau’s second IFP motion based on HRS § 607 -3 and HRAP Rule 
24, and then in dismissing her appeal.  We further hold that, 
consistent with the fundamental tenet of Hawaiʻi law that 
submissions of self-represented  litigants should be interprete d 
liberally, see Waltrip v. TS Enters., Inc. , 140 Hawaiʻi 226, 239, 
398 P.3d 815, 828 (2016), w hen courts have discretion in 
applying court rules or statutes, they must consider the access **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
5 
 to justice principle of reducing barriers to the civil justice 
system for self-represented  litigants.   
 We therefore vacate the ICA’s June 20, 2019 “Order 
Dismissing Appeal,” grant Tigilau ’s motion to this court for IFP 
status on appeal, and remand this case to the ICA for further 
proceedings consistent with this opinion.  
II.  Background  
 
A.  District court proceedings  
 On December 7, 2018, Estate Administrative Services, LLC, 
Interim Personal Representative for the Estate of Philip Finn 
(“Estate Services”) filed a complaint for e jectment in district 
court.  The compla int alleged that Philip Finn  was the owner of 
a property and that various people, including Tigilau, were 
occupying the property without a rental agreement or an 
ownership interest in the property  and refused to vacate.   After 
various proceedings, on January 10, 2019, the district court 
entered a judgment for possession and issued a writ of 
possession as to Tigilau.   On January 20, 2019, Tigilau was 
served with the judgment for possession and writ of possession, 
as well as notice of Estate Services’ i ntent to execute the writ 
of possession.   On February 13, 2019 , Tigilau was removed from 
the property by deputy sheriffs.  **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
6 
 B. ICA proceedings  
 
 On January 23, 2019, Tigilau filed a notice of appeal in  
the ICA.   
 Tigilau filed a motion to proceed IFP along with her notice  
of appeal, stating that she could not afford the costs of the  
appeal (“first IFP motion”).   On January 25,  2019, the ICA 
entered an order denying Tigilau’s  first IFP motion.   The order 
stated in relevant part: 4
(2) “A motion for leave to proceed on appeal  
[IFP] . . . shall ordinarily be made in the 
first instance to the court . . . appealed 
from.”  HRAP Rule 24(a).  Exceptions exist if 
the motion shows “that application to the court 
appealed from for th e relief sought is not 
practicable, or that the court appealed from 
has denied an application, or has failed to 
afford the requested relief, with the reasons 
given by the court appeal ed from for its 
action.”  Id.; and 
 
(3) Tigilau fails to demonstrate comp liance with 
HRAP Rule 24(a), or that any exceptions apply 
here. 
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion is 
denied without prejudice to Tigilau seeking relief in 
the underlying case, as follows:  
 
(1) Within ten (10) days from the date of this 
order, Tigilau shall either (i) file in the 
underlying case a motion for leave to proceed 
 
4   In deciding whether an IFP motion should be granted, with the obvious 
exception of a lack of subject matter jurisdiction, it is an abuse of 
discretion for a court to address the merits of the legal issues a party 
seeking IFP statu s seeks to raise.  See Blaisdell v. Dep’t of Pub. Safety , 
113 Hawaiʻi 315, 320 -21, 151 P.3d 796, 801 -02 (2007).  We therefore do not 
address the merits of Tigilau’s defenses in the district court or the issues 
she seeks to raise on appeal.  **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
7 (continued. . .)  
 on appeal  [IFP] that complies with HRAP Rule 
24(a), or (ii) pay the filing fees in the full 
amount to the Supreme Court Clerk’s Office.  
Failure to file in the underlying case a motion 
for leave to proceed on appeal  [IFP] or pay the 
filing fees may result in the appeal being 
dismissed.  See HRAP Rule 24(c)[.]  
 
 Thus, the ICA ordered T igilau to file an IFP motion in the 
district court or pay the filing fee within 10 days.  She did 
neither.  I nstead, o n February 7, 2019, Tigilau filed a second 
motion for leave to proceed on appeal IFP in the ICA  (“second 
IFP motion”).  This time, Tigilau submitted a notarized Form 4 
to the HRAP, an “Affidavit to Accompany Motion for Le ave to 
Appeal [IFP].”   In the affidavit, Tigilau attested under oath 
that January 6, 2011 had been t he last date she had been 
employed and that her monthly wage at the time had been  $560.00.    
She also attested that she had not received any income within 
the last twelve months; she did not have any cash or a checking 
or savings account; and she did not own any real estate, stocks, 
bonds, notes, automobiles, or other valuable property (excluding 
ordinary household furnishings and clothing).  
 On June 4, 2019, the ICA entered an order d enying Tigilau’s 
second IFP motion.5  The ICA denied the second IFP motion on the 
 
5  In the meanti me, Tigilau filed a jurisdictional statement on February 
7, 2019, and another jurisdictional statement and a motion for a thirty -day 
extension to file her opening brief on May 20, 2019.  The district court **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
8 (continued. . .)  
 same grounds as the first, and again ordered Tigilau to file an 
IFP motion in the district court or pay the filing fees within 
ten days or ri sk dismissal of her appeal .6  The ICA stated in 
relevant part:  
 (1)  On January 25, 2019, the court denied Tigilau ’s 
January 23, 2019 motion for leave to proceed on appeal 
[IFP] without prejudice to her seeking relief in the 
underlying district court case  . . . because she did not 
demonstrate that she first sought relief in the underlying 
case, consistent with [HRAP Rule 24(a)] or that any 
exceptions applied;  
 
 (2) Tigilau again seeks leave to proceed on appeal 
[IFP]; 
 
 (3)  “A motion for leave to proceed on appeal 
[IFP] . . . shall ordinarily be made in the first instance 
to the court . . . appealed from. ”  HRAP Rule 24(a).  
Exceptions exist if the motion shows “that application to 
the court appealed from for the relief sought is not 
practicable, or that the court appealed from has denied an 
application , or has failed to afford the requested relief, 
with the reasons given by the court appealed from for its 
action.”  Id.  Again, Tigilau fails to demonstrate 
compliance with HRAP Rule 24( a), or that any exceptions 
apply here; [7] 
 
(continued. . .) 
clerk filed a record on appeal and amended records  on appeal on February 27 
and 28, and May 23, 2019.    
 
6  Both orders of denial also did not give Tigilau the option of stating 
whether filing a motion in the district court would not be practicable, as 
provided by HRAP Rule 24(a).  
   
7  The ICA also state d as follows, which is not relevant based on 
Blaisdell , supra note 4, and which, in any event, was not a basis upon which 
Tigilau’s  appeal was eventually dismissed, as the dismissal was based solely 
on Tigilau’s alleged failure to comply with HRAP Rule 24:  
 
(4)  In addition, Tigilau is required to serve a filed copy 
of the notice of appeal on each other party, and file a 
proof of serv ice within seven days after filing the notice 
of appeal.  HRAP Rule 3(e )(1).  Further, Tigilau is 
required to serve all other parties with all documents she **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
9 (continued. . .)  
    
  . . . . 
 Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is 
denied without prejudice to Tigilau seeking relief in the 
underlying district court case  . . . as follows:  
 
 (1) Within ten (10) days from the date of 
this order, Tigilau shall either (i) file in 
the underlying case a motion for leave to 
proceed on appeal [IFP] that complies with HRAP 
Rule 24(a), or (ii) pay the filing fees in the 
full amount to the Supreme Court Clerk’s 
Office.  Failure to file in th e underlying case 
a motion for leave to proceed on appeal  [IFP] 
or pay the filing fees may result in the appeal 
being dismissed.  See HRAP Rule 24(c)[.8] 
    . . . . 
 Tigilau did not pay the appellate filing fee or file a 
motion for leave to proceed on ap peal IFP in the district court 
case within ten days.9  Then, on June 20, 2019, the ICA entered 
 
(continued. . .) 
files in this appeal, and file proof of service of the 
documents.  See HRAP Rule 25(b) -(d).  The record does not 
reflect that Tigilau served Defendants -Appellees Sione P. 
Mohulamu, Falaula Tinoga, Sr., or Samantha Kaliko with the 
notice of appeal, the instant Motion, or any other 
documents she filed in this appeal .  
   
8 The ICA furthered ordered as fol lows, which is not relevant to the 
issues in this certiorari proceeding, see supra notes 4 and 7:  
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that within ten days from the 
date of this order, Tigilau shall file a certificate 
of service, consistent with HRAP Rule 25(b) through  
(d), indicating she served Defendants -Appellees Sione 
P. Mohulamu, Falaula Tinoga, Sr., and Samantha Kaliko 
with filed copies of every document she filed in this 
appeal.  Failure to timely comply with this order may 
result in sanctions.  
 
9  On June 18, 20 19, in response to the portion of the  ICA’s order  
discussed in note 7, supra, Tigilau filed  a motion requesting the addresses 
of all the other named defendants.   Tigilau explained that she needed **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
10 
 an “Order Dismissing Appeal .”10  In this order, the ICA repeated 
the procedural history above regarding Tigilau’s motions to 
proceed IFP.   The ICA stated in relevant part as  follows: 
(8) On June 4, 2019, the court, among other things, 
denied Tigilau’s February 7, 2019 motion for 
leave to proceed [IFP] again without prejudice 
to Tigilau, within ten days from the order, 
either filing in the underlying case a motion  
for leave to proceed on appeal [IFP] that 
complied with HRAP Rule 24(a), or paying the 
filing fees in the full amount. . . .  The 
court again cautioned Tigilau that “[f]ailure 
to file in the underlying case a motion for 
leave to proceed on appeal [IFP] or  pay the 
filing fees may result in the appeal being 
dismissed.  See HRAP Rule 24(c);”  
  
(9) Tigilau has not paid the filing fees, filed in 
the underlying case a motion for leave to 
proceed on appeal [IFP], or taken any further 
action in this appeal.[11]  Consistent with the 
 
(continued. . .) 
addresses for Sione P. Mohulamu, Falaula Tinoga, Sr., and Sa mantha Kaliko in 
order to serve them, in compliance with the ICA’s order.   Tigilau included a 
declaration stating the following:  
 
(1) That I am not a lawyer;  
(2) That I was only defending myself;  
(3) That I have not been given adequate , effective 
and meaningful access to any of t he courts in 
the State of Hawai i. 
(4) That I need the addresses of Sione P. Mohulamu, 
Falaula Tinoga Sr., Samantha Kaliko  to gain 
adequate, effective and meaningful access to 
this Honorable Court.  
 
10  Although no stipulation existed, the document signed by the ICA was 
actually captioned “Order Approving Stipulation to Dismiss Appeal.”   On July 
12, 2019, a single -judge order was entered correcting the title of the 
document to “Order Dismissing Appeal.”   On February 13, 2020, after this 
court’s August 26, 2019 acceptance of certiorari,  Tigilau filed a document 
requesting information regarding this correction.    
 
11  But see supra notes 9 and 13.  
 **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
11 
 June 4, 2019 order and HRAP Rule 24(c), 
dismissal of the appeal is warranted.  
 
 Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal  
is dismissed.[ ] 12
 
 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions  
are dismissed.[ ] 13
 
 The ICA concluded that dismissal of Tigilau’s appeal was 
warranted  based on i ts prior rulings and HRAP Rul e 24(c), and  it 
dismissed Tigilau’s  appeal.   
 
 
 
12  The ICA also stated as follows:  
 
(5) On February 27, 2019, the district court clerk 
filed the record on appeal and the appellate 
clerk notified Tigilau that the statement of 
jurisdiction and opening brief were due on or 
before March 1 1, 2019, and April 8, 2019, 
respectively;  
 
(6) Tigilau failed to timely file either document 
or request an extension of time, and therefore 
is in default;  
 
(7) On May 20, 2019, Tigilau filed a late statement 
of jurisdiction without the court’s permission, 
and a motion for extension of time for the 
opening brief [.] 
 
As Tigilau had  never been placed on notice that these issues could result in 
dismissal of her appeal, which would have made dismissal on any of these 
bases improper, see In re Marn Family Litig ., 132 Hawaiʻi 165, 170, 319 P.3d 
1173, 1178 (2014), and because the language of the ICA ’s dismissal order 
indicates that dismissal of Tigilau ’s appeal was based solely HRAP Rule 24, 
we do not further discuss these matters .   
 
13  Tigilau had filed a motion for a thirty -day extension to file her 
opening brief on May 20, 2019  and a motion for the clerk of the court to give 
her the addresses of the other parties on June 18, 2019.  
 **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
12 
 C. Certiorari application  
 
 On July 10, 2019, Tigilau filed an application for writ of 
certiorari.   In relevant part, Tigilau explains that she “feels 
that this Honorable Court is prejudice[d] against her for  not 
having the funds necessary to pay [the appellate filing fee].”   
Tigilau also states she “knows that  she must file a motion for 
leave to proceed on appeal [IFP] per court that she enters. [14]  
Therefore as mentioned she did file her motion for leave to 
proceed on appeal [IFP].”   
 Along with her certiorari application,  Tigilau filed a  
motion to proceed IFP on appeal , which we grant .  
III.  Standards of review  
A. Interpretation of statutes and court rules  
 “When interpreting rules promulgated by the court,   
principles of statutory construction apply.”  Kawamata Farms,   
Inc. v. United Agri Products, 86 Hawai ʻi 214, 255, 948 P.2d 1055,   
1096 (1997) (quoting State v. Baron, 80 Hawai ʻi 107, 113, 905   
P.2d 613, 619 (1995)).  “The standard of review for statutory   
construction is well- established.  The interpretation of a   
 
14  It thus appears Tigilau’s understanding was that the IFP motion must be 
filed in the court she seeks to access, which is not an unreasonable 
understanding.   
 **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
13 
 statute is a question of law which this court reviews de novo.”   
Id. (quoting State v. Wells, 78 Hawai ʻi 373, 376, 894 P.2d 70,   
73 (1995)).  
B. Ruling on a motion to proceed IFP  
 A court’s ruling on a motion to proceed IFP is reviewed for 
an abuse of discr etion.  Blaisdell , 113 Hawaiʻi at 319, 151 P.3d 
at 800.  An abuse of discretion  occurs if a trial court has 
clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or has disregarded rules 
or principles of law or practice to the substantial  detriment of 
a party litigant.  State v. Davia , 87 Hawaiʻi 249, 253, 953 P.2d 
1347, 1351 (1998)  (internal quotation mark and citations 
omitted).  
IV.  Discussion  
 
A. Under the circumstances, the ICA abused its discretion in 
requiring Tigilau to file an IFP motion in the district court, 
by denying her second IFP motion , and by dismissing her appeal  
  
 Tigilau filed two motions to proceed IFP on appeal.  The 
ICA denied b oth motions based solely on language in HRAP Rule 
24(a), which provides in part that “[a] motion for leave to 
proceed on appeal [IFP] . . . shall ordinarily be made in the 
first instance to the court . . . appealed from.”   
 In denying Tigilau’s two IFP mo tions, the ICA ordered that 
she either file an IFP motion in the district court within ten **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
14 
 days or pay filing fees in full.  The ICA also stated in both 
orders that her failure to comply could result in a dismissal of 
Tigilau’s appeal pursuant to HRAP Rule  24(c).  As the ICA orders 
denying Tigilau’s first and second IFP motions recognized, 
however, HRAP Rule 24 does not require a litigant to file an IFP 
motion in the court appealed from.   
 Although subsection (a) of HRAP Rule 24  provides  (with 
emphasis added)  that an IFP motion “shall ordinarily  be made in 
the first instance to  the court . . . appealed from[,]”  it also 
provides that “[a] party to an action in the  . . . 
district . . . court . . . who desires to proceed on 
appeal [IFP] may  file in the appellate court a motion for leave 
to so proceed ” and that an IFP motion filed in an appellate 
court “shall show that application to the court appealed from  
for the relief sought  is not practicable ” if an IFP motion has 
not been  filed in  the court appe aled from.  Thus, HRAP Rule 
24(a) does not actually require the filing of an IFP motion in 
the lower court, and it allows an IFP motion to be granted if 
filing a motion in the court appealed from would not be 
practicable.15 
 
15  The dissent asserts that HRAP Rule 24(a) is unambiguous.  For these 
reasons, we disagree.  **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
15 
  In this regard, the la nguage of HRAP Rule 24(a) indicating 
that an IFP motion shall ordinarily  be made in the first 
instance to the court appealed from contemplates that the 
appellant was a party who was required to pay some costs below. 
That party is usually the plaintiff.  At  minimum, the structure 
of the rule contemplates that the court being appealed from 
would have greater information than the appellate court as to an 
appealing party’s ability to pay filing fees.  This is not 
always the case, especially in an appeal brought by a self -
represented defendant  in an ejectment case .  An appellate court  
would generally  be just as readily able to evaluate whether a 
self-represented defendant would qualify for IFP status , based 
on financial information  submitted to the appellate court .  
 In addition, especially because Tigilau is a self -
represented defendant appealing a writ of possession in a 
residential ejectment case, even if the ICA had discretion to 
order a remand , HRAP Rule  24(a) states that the appellant has 
the option of explaining why filing a motion in the lower court 
would not be practicable.   This option was not provided to 
Tigilau, and the ICA had the discretion to address 
practicability on its own accord.   **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
16 
  Moreover , ordering a n appella nt to file an IFP motion in  
the district court does not promote efficiency.  It takes very 
little time for an appellate court to address and decide an IFP 
motion.  An appeal of a judgment and writ of possession is an 
urgent matter.  And whether or not an appeal concerns an urgent 
matter, t he interests of judicial economy make a n order 
requiring an appella nt to refile an IFP motion in  a lower court 
even more impracticable , when the appellate cou rt is readily 
able to evaluate an appellant’s IFP application .  Unless there 
is a real concern that the financial information provided by an 
appellant is misleading or insufficient , and the appellate court 
has reason to believe that the lower court may be in a better 
position to evaluate the information , there would be little 
reason to require that an appella nt first file a motion in the 
lower court .   
 In Tigilau ’s case, because of  the urgency of her appeal  in 
relation to the time it would take the distric t court to finally 
determine whether she would be granted IFP status , the ICA 
should have exercised its discretion to rule on her IFP motion .  
The ICA entered orders with instructions.  The ICA orders would 
have required T igilau to ascertain where and how to file an IFP 
motion in the district court.  If such motion were filed, a **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
17 
 district court clerk  would need to r efer it to a district court 
judge, preferably the judge that entered the writ and judgment 
of possession.  The district court judge would then need to 
review and decide the motion .  The judge or clerk would 
thereafter need to enter an order granting or denying the 
motion, and also file a notice of its entry so that the ICA 
would be alerted.  I f the IFP motion were granted, the order 
granting IFP status would then need to come to the attention of 
ICA staff or judges so that the appeal could proceed.  If the 
IFP motion were denied, Tigilau would have  had the option of 
then filing another motion in the ICA pursuant to HRAP Rule 
24(a).  Almost all of these intermediary steps would be avoided 
if the ICA ruled on the motion in the first instance, as it has 
discretion  to do.16   
 
16  The dissent cites to Goo v. Arakawa , 132 Hawaiʻi 304, 317, 321 P.3d 655, 
668 (2014) , for the proposition that “[r]emand to the lower court [for 
factual determinations] protects the ‘orderly operation of the judicial 
system’ by leaving fact -finding powers with the trial courts and review of 
the trial courts’ discretion to the appellate courts.”  Goo addressed 
situations where a fact -intensive inquiry could be required in order to 
determine whether mootness on appeal was the result of happenstance or a 
party’s voluntary action; Goo indicated that in such circumstances, it would 
be appropriate for an appellate court to remand the case to the trial court 
for its evaluation.  132 Hawaiʻi at 317-18, 321 P.3d at 668-69.  Goo  
addressed a special situation in which the appellate court may  lack 
sufficient information.  In this case, the ICA had sufficient information to 
rule on Tigilau’s IFP motion.  Therefore, Goo is inapposite.

  Thus, under the c ircumstances of this case, with Tigilau 
being a self -represented defendant , and because she submitted 
sufficient financial information, the ICA should have addressed 
her IFP motions  without requiring her to file a motion in 
district court . 
 Further, it is also significant that Tigilau did not cite 
to HRAP Rule 24 in either of her IFP motions as a basis for her 
request for waiver of costs on appeal.  The ICA analyzed 
Tigilau’s IFP motions strictly according to the language of HRAP 
Rule 24(a).  HRS § 607 -3, however, also provides an independent 
basis for the grant of an IFP motion.17  Blaisdell  analyzed a 
self-represented  prisoner’s IFP motion in a civil case solely 
under the “onerous” standard of HRS § 607 -3, 113 Hawaiʻi at 319, 
151 P.3d at 800, despite the existence of a specific circuit 
court rule governing IFP requests based on “good cause.”18  Based 
on the financial i nformation provided in Tigilau’s second IFP 
motion, payment of appellate filing fees would clearly have been 
“onerous” to Tigilau, as “ excessively burdensome so as to cause 
 
17  See supra note 2.  Thus, an amendment to HRAP Rule 24 was not necessary 
for the ICA to address Tigilau ’s motion, as maintained by the dissent.  We 
agree with the dissent, however, that HRAP Rule 24 should be amended to 
obviate the inefficiencies inherent in the structure of the rule.

 hardship. ”  Id.  Hence, the ICA abused its discretion in denying 
Tigilau’s second I FP motion based on both HRAP Rule 24(a) and 
HRS § 607 -3.19   
 The ICA’s dismissal of Tigilau’s  appeal, based on its 
denial of her second IFP motion, which should have been granted, 
contravenes the policy of determining cases on the merits.   The 
ICA therefore also abused its discretion in dismissing Tigilau’s 
appeal.   
B. When courts have discretion  in applying  court rules or 
 statutes, they must consider the access to justice 
 principle of reducing barri ers to the civil justice system   
 
 Tigilau also argues on certiorari that “Defendant -
Appella[nt] Christy Tigilau  doesn’t have any funds and the 
courts know that.  They know that Christy Tigilau Defendant -
Appella[nt] doesn’t have any funds therefore she feels the 
courts won’t let her state her side of the case which is a 
denial of access to this court.”   Tigilau also  highlights the 
 
19  The dissent maintains that HRS § 607 -3 is not an  independent basis for 
granting an IFP motion because HRAP Rule 24(a) merely sets out a process for 
invoking HRS § 607-3, which provides the standard for granting an IFP motion .  
Yet, HRAP Rule 24(a) is much more than a mere rule of process, as it requires 
an appellant to also show “ the party’s inability to pay the required filing 
fees or to give security for costs, the party’s belief that [the party] is 
entitled to redress, and a statement of the issues that the party intends to 
present on appeal.”   Thus, HRAP Rule 24(a) provides standards for IFP status 
that do not exist in HRS § 607 -3, which only requires  a showing that payment 
of filing fees would be “onerous. ”

 fact that she is not an attorney and relies on Haines v. Kerner , 
404 U.S. 519 (1972)  (per curiam) , for the proposition that 
courts should be more lenient with self-represented  litigants 
than with trained attorneys.    
 In Haines, the United States Supreme Court made clear that 
complaints by self-represented litigants  are to be held “to less 
stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers[.]”  
404 U.S. at 520.  Similarly, a fundamental tenet of Hawaiʻi law 
is that submissions of self-represented  litigants s hould be 
interpreted liberally.   Waltrip, 140 Hawaiʻi at 239, 398 P.3d at 
828.  In addition, this court has stated that “[i]n some 
instances, a plaintiff’s [self-represented]  status might warrant 
a court’s refusal to impo se any c osts or attorney’s fees,” 
although  “the right of self -representation is not . . . a 
license not to comply with the relevant rules of procedural and 
substantive law.”   Lepere v. United Pub . Workers, Local 646, 
AFL-CIO, 77 Hawaiʻi 471, 473 n.2, 887 P.2d 1029, 1031 n.2 (1995) 
(citations, internal quotation  marks, and original brackets 
omitted).  
 As contended by Tigilau, the denial of IFP status to those 
like her  affects access to justice in civil matters for those 
unable to afford l egal representation.  Ou r judiciary has taken **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
21 
 an active role in seeking to advance  access to justice in civil 
cases, especially for self -represented litigants .  Rule 21 
(2015) of the Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of Hawaiʻi 
created the Hawaiʻi Access to Justice Commission , whose purposes 
under subsection (b)  include reducing barriers to the civil 
justice system by giving input on existing laws and court rules 
that may affect meaningful access to justice for low -income 
Hawaiʻi residents (subsection  7) and encouraging judges to take a 
leadership role in expanding access to civil justice (subsection 
8).   
 This court has long adhered to the policy of affording 
litigants the opportunity to be heard on the merits whenever 
possible.  Morgan v. Planning D ep’t, 104 Hawaiʻi 173, 180 -81, 86 
P.3d 982, 989 -90 (2004) (citation omitted).  Yet, the dissent 
supports an application of HRAP Rule 24 that would deny Tigilau 
any review of the merits her appeal.20  The dissent supports the 
ICA’s dismissal of appeals “where litigants have not paid the 
appropriate fees or secured IFP status[,] ” even if a litigant 
 
20  We note that pursuant to HRS § 641 -1(a) (2016), civil appeal deadlines 
are presc ribed by court rule.  As Tigilau was appealing January 10, 2019 
decisions, the ICA would have been without appellate jurisdiction over a new 
notice of appeal filed by Tigilau after the ICA’s June 20, 2019 dismissal of 
her appeal.  Thus, adoption of the dis sent’s position would have denied  
Tigilau access to our appellate courts regarding  the merits of her appeal.  **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **

 could have secured IFP status if the ICA had chosen to exercise 
its discretion to rule on the IFP motion itself .  
 Our state courts should embrace access to jus tice 
principles in practice.   In furtherance of such principles, we 
therefore now hold that, consistent with the fundamental tenet 
of Hawaiʻi law that submissions of self-represented  litigants 
should be interpreted liberally, Waltrip, 140 Hawaiʻi at 239, 3 98 
P.3d at 828, when courts have discretion in applying  court rules 
or statutes, they must consider the access to justice principle 
of reducing barriers to the civil justice system  for self-
represented  litigants .  
V.  Conclusion  
 We therefore grant Tigilau ’s July 10, 2019 motion for IFP 
status on appeal, vacate the ICA’s June 20, 2019 “Order 
Dismissing Appeal ,” and remand this case to the ICA for further 
proceedings consistent with this opinion.
