OPINION OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J.   
 
I.  Introduction  
 
 The Intermediate Court of Appeals (“ICA”) dismissed this 
appeal on the grounds that appellate jurisdiction was lacking.  
The ICA ruled that the Circuit Court of the First Circuit Electronically Filed

 (“circuit court”)1 abused its discretion in finding the existence 
of “excusa ble neglect” under Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure 
(“HRAP”) Rule 4(a)(4)(B) (2016) to allow an extension of time to 
file a notice of appeal.   
 We hold that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion 
in determining that “excusable neglect” existed  to grant 
Petitioner Scott Foyt’s (“Foyt”) motion for extension of time to 
file a notice of appeal, and we therefore vacate the ICA’s May 
21, 2019 “Order Dismissing Appellate Court Case Number CAAP -19-
0000095 for Lack of Appellate Jurisdiction” and remand this case 
to the ICA to address the merits of the appeal.  Further, in 
Enos v. Pac. Transfer & Warehouse , 80 Hawaiʻi 345, 910 P.2d 116 
(1996), this court adopted definitions of “good cause” as 
factors beyond the movant’s control and “excusable neglect” as 
factors within the movant’s control for purposes of former HRAP 
Rule 4(a)(5).  Former HRAP Rule 4(a)(5), however, allowed for 
extensions based on either standard, whether filed within the 
first thirty or next thirty days.  The division of  HRAP Rule 
4(a)(5) into two subsections reflected in the current HRAP Rule 
4(a)(4)(A) and (B), which now allow for extensions within the 
first thirty days only if “good cause” exists or within the next

 thirty days only if “excusable neglect” exists , has resulted in 
dismissa ls of appeals in contravention of “the policy of  
law . . . favor[ing] dispositions of litigation on the merits .”  
Shasteen, Inc. v. Hilton Hawaiian Village Joint Venture , 79 
Hawaiʻi 103, 107, 899 P.2d 386, 390 (1995).  We therefore clarify 
the terms.  
II.  Background  
A.  Factual Summary  
 Eckard Brandes, Inc. (“Eckard Brandes”) is a contractor 
that performs sewer pipe cleaning, inspection, and repair work, 
including on governmental public works projects.   Eckard Brandes 
employees are paid at different rates for work performed based 
on differing job classifications.   Foyt was employed by Eckard 
Brandes from May 2000 to July 2013.   During his employment, Foyt 
operated different kinds of trucks on various jobs, including 
projects for the State of Hawaiʻi (“State”) and the City and 
County of Honolulu (“City”).   Chapter 104 of the Hawaiʻi Revised 
Statutes (“HRS”) includes provisions governing wage requirements 
for certain kinds of work performed for the State and City.  
B. Procedural Background  
 1.  Notice of Violation  
 In 2013, Foyt filed a complaint disputing his wages on 
various State and/or City jobs.   After an investigation 
conducted by the Wage Standards Division of the Department of **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
4 
 Labor and Industrial Relations (“DLIR”), a May 4, 2017 Notice of 
Violation was sent to Eckard Brandes.   The notice alleged 
violations of HRS Chapter 104,2 stating in rele vant part as 
follows:  
Prevailing Wages 
Section 104 -2(b), HRS, requires that every laborer or mechanic 
performing work on the job site for the construction of any 
public work project shall be paid no less than prevailing wages.  
WSD [Wage Standard Division]’s investigation found that an 
employee was classified as a Laborer I for some hours and Laborer 
II for other hours , but the employee should have been classified 
as a Truck Driver Tandem Dump T ruck, over 8 cu. yds.; Water Truck 
(over 2,000 gallons) for all hours.  
 
Overtime  
Section 104 -2(c), HRS, requires the payment of overtime on 
Saturday, Sunday, a legal State holiday, or for time worked 
in excess of eight hours on any other day.   WSD found that 
an employee was paid the straight -time rate for hours 
exceeding eight hours per day.  
 
Certified Payrolls and Recordkeeping  
Section 104 -3(a), HRS, requires a certified copy of all 
payrolls to be submitted weekly to the contracting agency.  
The certification shall affirm that the payrolls are 
 
2  HRS § 104 -23 (2012 & Supp. 2016) provides:  
 
§ 104-23  Notification of violation.   (a)  When the 
department, either as a result of a report by a contracting 
agency or as a result of the department’s own 
investigation, finds that a violation of this chapter or of 
the terms of the contract subject to this chapte r has been 
committed, the department shall issue a notification of 
violation to the contractor or subcontractor involved.  
     (b)  A notification of violation shall be final and 
conclusive unless within twenty days after a copy has been 
sent to the contra ctor, the contractor files a written 
notice of appeal with the director.  
     (c)  A hearing on the written notice of appeal shall 
be held by a hearings officer appointed by the director in 
conformance with chapter 91.  
     Hearings on appeal shall be held  within sixty days of 
the notice of appeal and a decision shall be rendered by 
the hearings officer within sixty days after the conclusion 
of the hearing, stating the findings of fact and 
conclusions of law.   The hearings officer may extend the 
due date fo r decision for good cause; provided that all 
parties agree.

 correct and complete, that the wage rates are not less than 
the applicable rates contai ned in the Wage Rate Schedule, 
and that the classifications conform with the work the 
laborer or mechanic performed.  WSD found the following:  
 
  The employee who was classified as a Laborer I for 
some hours and Laborer II for other hours, should 
have been  classified as a Truck Driver Tandem Dump 
Truck, over 8 cu.yds .; Water Truck (over 2,000 
gallons) . 
 
The employer classified employees as “Laborer”,       
rather than “Laborer I” or “Laborer II”.  
 
 Pursuant to Section 104 -23(b), HRS, this Notification 
of Violation may be appealed by filing a written notice of 
appeal with the Director within twenty (20) days after the 
date of this notification.  
 
 The balance due on the Wage and Penalty Assessment for m 
should be paid by May 24, 2017, to avoid further legal 
action, including immediate suspension from performing work 
on any State or county public works project. . . .  
 
Eckard Brandes was assessed back wages due and a 10% penalty, 
for a total assessment of $60,131.12.       
 2.  Request for Hearing  
 On May 16, 2017, Eckard Brandes filed an appeal of the 
Notice of Violation with the Director of the DLIR pursuant to 
HRS § 104-23(b) and requested a hearing pursuant to HRS § 104 -
23(c).3  The Notice of Hearing listed Eckard Brandes as the 
appellant and the DLIR as the appellee.   Foyt was a witness at 
the hearing, but he was not named as a party.   The hearing was 
held on Augu st 11 and 14, 2017.   On December 6, 2017, a hearing 
officer issued a detailed Decision and Order affirming the 
Notice of Violation.

 **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **

  3.  Appeal to the Circuit Court  
 On January 4, 2018, Eckard Brandes filed a Notice of Agency
Appeal.  Again, the only parties were Eckard Brandes as 
appellant and DLIR as appellee.  Foyt was not listed on the 
certificate of service of the notice of agency appeal.   
 Following briefing, another circuit court judge  held oral  
argument, and on December 19, 2018, issued an order reversing  
the Decision and Order, concluding that a July 2005 letter from 
a former DLIR Director  established that sewer line cleaning work
was not subject to HRS chapter 104.  34
 
 
4  The Honorable Keith K. Hiraoka presided over the actual agency appeal.  
 
3   The July 26, 2005 letter stated:  
 
This letter is to inform you that you will not 
receive a survey this year because the classification 
of Sewer Line Tele -Repairer will be discontinued as 
of the next Wage Rate Schedule, Bulletin Number 461, 
which will be issued on September 2005.  
 
Input from the industry brought to our attention the 
distinction between inspection and cleaning versus 
repair.  The inspection and cleaning function is not 
considered construction work as covered under Chapter 
104, HRS, therefore it will not be included  in the 
prevailing wage rate schedule .  The repair work i s 
same work that would be classified as Laborer I, a 
classification that already exists.  
 
Additionally, under Section 104 -2(b), HRS, the law 
states that “prevailing wages shall not be less than 
the wages payable under federal law to corresponding 
classes.”  The U.S. Department of Labor does not 
include a separate classification for sewer line 
telerepairer work for construction projects covered 
by the federal Davis -Bacon Act.  Work of that nature 
is classified as Laborer I.  Thus, maintaining the 
rate classification of Sewer Line Tele -Repairer 
creates a prevailing wage that is less than the wages  
payable under federal law to corresponding classes, 
and is contrary to the law.  **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
7 (continued. . .)  
 The circuit court’s order  stated: 
The Court finds that Appellee was bound by the July 2005 
letter, from then Director Nelson Befitel, that the work of 
sewer line cleaning was not subject to Chapter 104 HRS and 
therefore, the work performed by the Claimant at the time, 
was not subject to Chapter 104 HRS.  
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the 
Decision and Order of the Department of Labor and 
Industrial Relations, Wage Standards Division, Hearings 
Branch, dated December 6, 2017, is reversed . 
 
Pursuant to Rule 72(k)  of the Hawaii Rules of Civil 
Procedure, the clerk of the Court shall notify the 
governmental official or body concerned of the disposition 
of this appeal.  The Court further orders that the agency 
take action consistent with the Court’s ruling.  
 
(Emphasis in the original.)  Final judgment was entered the same 
day.     
 4. Foyt’s Motion to Intervene    
 More than one month after the December 19, 2018 final 
judgment, on January 25, 2019, Foyt, through counsel, filed two 
motions in the circuit court case.  The first was a motion for 
leave to intervene for the sole purpose of appealing the 
December 19, 2018 final judgment.  The second was a motion to 
extend the time to file a notice of appeal from the December 19, 
2018 final judgment.  At the time thes e motions were filed, the 
thirty-day period under HRAP Rule 4(a) to file an appeal from 
the December 19, 2018 judgment had already expired.4   
 
4  HRAP Rule 4(a) provides in pertinent part:  
 
(a) Appeals in civil cases.  
(1) Time and place of filing . When a civil appeal is 
permitted by law, the notice of appeal shall be filed **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
8 
   In filings regarding these motions, counsel for Foyt 
represented Foyt had not received a copy of the final judg ment 
until after Christmas of 2018, had then spent several weeks 
searching for an attorney, and that counsel had been officially 
retained on January 17, 2019.  He represented that the day 
before he had been retained, he had spoken with counsel for 
DLIR, wh o informed him that DLIR would not be appealing the 
circuit court’s final judgment and that DLIR would not be 
willing to file a motion to extend time to file a notice of 
appeal, but would stipulate to an extension of time for Foyt to 
appeal.  Counsel for F oyt also declared he had not heard back 
from Eckard Brandes’ counsel as to whether the company would 
also be willing to so stipulate.  Counsel also pointed out that 
Foyt was directly affected by the final judgment disallowing the 
additional wages that DLIR  had ordered Eckard Brandes to pay to 
him.   
 By orders entered on February 13, 2019, the circuit court 
granted both motions.  The order granting Foyt’s motion to 
extend the time to file a notice of appeal from the December 19, 
2018 judgment for an additio nal thirty days stated that the 
 
within 30 days after entry of the judgment or appealable 
order. 
. . . .

 circuit court’s decision was based on counsel’s arguments and 
“excusable neglect.”   
 5.  Appeal to the ICA   
 Two days later, on February 15, 2019, Foyt filed a notice 
of appeal from the circuit court’s December 19, 2018 final 
judgment to the ICA.  After the record on appeal was filed and 
before briefing, Foyt’s counsel filed a Jurisdictional Statement 
on April 22 , 2019, asserting appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 
HRAP Rule 4.  On April 25, 2019, Eckard Brandes filed a 
Statement Contesting Jurisdiction, asserting that Foyt failed to 
establish excusable neglect.   
 On May 21, 2019, the ICA filed an order dismissing  the 
appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction, holding the appeal 
untimely under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) because the record did not 
establish excusable neglect to extend the time to file the 
notice of appeal.  The ICA noted that the initial thirty -day 
time peri od under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) for filing a notice of 
appeal from the December 19, 2018 final judgment was Friday, 
January 18, 2019.  According to the ICA, because counsel for 
Foyt had admitted to speaking with counsel for DLIR on January 
16, 2019, two days be fore the deadline, and because “Foyt had an 
opportunity to intervene and pursue an appeal before January 18, 
2019[,]” the record did not support a finding of “excusable 
neglect.”    **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
10 
  6.  Certiorari Application   
 On July 19, 2019, Foyt timely4 filed an app lication for writ 
of certiorari to review the ICA’s May 21, 2019 dismissal order.  
Foyt contends that the ICA erred in concluding that excusable 
neglect had not been shown and by not reaching the merits of the 
appeal.  In opposition, Eckard Brandes argues that Foyt does not 
discuss the “excusable neglect standard or this court’s decision 
in Enos, in which this court stated “the character of the 
neglect, rather than the consequences, should be determinative 
of whether it is ‘excusable.’”  80 Hawaiʻi at 355, 910 P.2d at 
126.  Eckard Brandes further quotes this portion of that 
opinion:  
Thus, when considering a motion brought pursuant to HRAP 
Rule 4(a)(5), the trial court must first determine the 
cause of the delay in filing the notice of appeal.  If that 
cause is beyond the movant’s control, the motion may be 
granted upon a showing of “good cause.”  If the cause of 
the delay is some mistake or inadvertence within the 
control of the movant, the motion may be granted only upon 
a showing of “excusable neglect. ”  
 
Enos, 80 Hawaiʻi at 352, 910 P.2d at 123.  
III. Standards of Review  
A. Appellate Jurisdiction  
 “The existence of [appellate] jurisdiction is a question of 
law that we review de novo under the right/wrong standard. 
Construction of rules promulgated by th is court is also reviewed 
 
4   On June 6, 2019, Foyt timely requested and received an additional 
thirty days to file the application for writ of certiorari.  See HRAP Rule 
40.1(a)(1) and (a)(3) (2017).   **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **

 de novo.”  State v. Nilsawit , 139 Hawaiʻi 86, 90, 384 P.3d 862, 
866 (2016) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).   
B. Finding of Excusable Neglect  
 A trial court’s order granting a motion to extend time for 
filing a notice of appeal on the grounds of excusable neglect is 
reviewed for an abuse of discretion.   Hall v. Hall , 95 Hawaiʻi 
318, 319, 22 P.3d 965, 965 -66 (2001)  (overruling in part  Hall v. 
Hall, 96 Hawaiʻi 105, 111, 26 P.3d 594, 600 (App. 2001) . 
IV. Analysis  
A. Appellate jurisdiction exists because the circuit court did 
not err in determining that “excusable neglect” existed to 
grant the extension  
 
 The ICA dismissed Foyt’s appeal for lack of appell ate 
jurisdiction on the grounds that there was no “excusable 
neglect” under HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B) to authorize the circuit 
court to grant Foyt’s requested thirty -day extension to file his 
notice of appeal because Foyt had an opportunity to intervene 
and pursue an appeal before January 18, 2019.  
 Generally, “[w]hen a civil appeal is permitted by law, the 
notice of appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry of 
the judgment or appealable order.”  HRAP Rule 4(a)(1).  A party, 
however, may obtain an extension of time, after the initial 
thirty-day appeal deadline to file a notice of appeal has 
expired, upon the showing of “excusable neglect.”  HRAP Rule 
4(a)(4)(B).  HRAP Rule 4(a)(4) (2016) provides as follows:  **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
12 
  (4) Extensions of time to file  the notice of  appeal. 
      (A) Requests for extensions of time before expiration 
of the prescribed time.   The court or agency appealed from, 
upon a showing of good cause, may extend the time for 
filing a notice of appeal upon motion filed within the time 
prescribed by subsections (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this 
Rule.  However, no such extension shall exceed 30 d ays past 
such prescribed time.  An extension motion that is filed 
before the expiration of the prescribed time may be ex 
parte unless the court or agency otherwise requires.  
      (B) Requests for extensions of time after expiration 
of the prescribed time.   The court or agency appealed from, 
upon a showing of excusable neglect, may extend the time 
for filing the notice of appeal upon motion filed not later 
than 30 days after the expiration of the time prescribed by 
subsections (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this Rule.  However, 
no such extension shall exceed 30 days past the prescribed 
time.  Notice of an extension motion filed after the 
expiration of the prescribed time shall be given to the 
other parties in accordance with the rules of the court or 
agency appeal ed from.  
Thus, based on our current rule, requests for extensions of time 
to file a notice of appeal before expiration of the initial 
thirty days are governed by the “good cause” standard of HRAP 
Rule 4(a)(4)(A), while requests made after the expiration of  the 
initial thirty days are generally governed by the “excusable 
neglect” standard of HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B).  
The circuit court and the ICA analyzed the timeliness of 
Foyt’s appeal in this case based on the “excusable neglect” 
standard of HRAP Rule 4(a)(4) (B), as more than thirty days had 
elapsed after the entry of the circuit court’s final judgment.    
The ICA and Eckard Brandes cite to this court’s opinion in 
Enos, 80 Hawaiʻi 345, 910 P.2d 116, for the definition of 
“excusable neglect” as a cause beyond the movant’s control.  
Enos governed extensions of time to file notices of appeal under **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
13 
 a different version of HRAP Rule 4(a), which was former HRAP 
Rule 4(a)(5):  
The court or  agency appealed from, upon a showing of 
excusable neglect or good cause, may extend the time for 
filing a notice of appeal upon motion actually filed not 
later than 30 days after the expiration of the time 
prescribed by subsections (a)(1) through (a)(4) o f 
this Rule 4.  Any such motion which is filed before 
expiration of the prescribed time may be ex parte unless 
the court otherwise requires.  Notice of any such motion 
which is filed after expiration of the prescribed time 
shall be given to the other pa rties in accordance with the 
rules of the court or agency appealed from.  No such 
extension shall exceed 30 days past such prescribed time or 
10 days from the date of entry of the order granting the 
motion, whichever occurs later.  
 
Enos noted that HRAP Rul e 4(a)(5) was “patterned after 
Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure (“FRAP”) Rule 4(a)(5), 
which, until its amendment in 1979, allowed extension of time 
only upon a showing of [the stricter] excusable neglect.”  Enos, 
80 Hawaiʻi at 350, 10 P.2d at 121.  Al though a majority of 
federal Circuit Courts of Appeal had held the “good cause” 
standard applicable only when a motion to extend was filed 
during the initial thirty -day period, we adopted the approach of 
the First Circuit Court of Appeals consistent with t he plain 
language of the rule, and we allowed the “good cause” standard 
to apply to requests for extensions whether they were filed 
within the initial thirty days or within the next thirty days.  
Enos, 80 Hawaiʻi at 350, 351, 910 P.2d at 121, 122.   **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
14 
 After holding both standards applicable whether a motion 
was filed during the initial thirty days or the next thirty 
days, we then also held:  
when considering a motion brought pursuant to  HRAP Rule 
4(a)(5), the trial court must first determine the cause of 
the delay in filing the notice of appeal.  If that cause is 
beyond the movant’s control, the motion may be granted upon 
a showing of “good cause.”  If the cause of the delay is 
some mistake or inadvertence within the control of the 
movant, the motion may be granted only upon a showing of 
“excusable neglect.”  
 
Enos, 80 Hawaiʻi at 352, 910 P.2d at 123.  Thus, we also held in 
Enos that if the cause of the delay was within the control of 
the movant, a motion to extend could only be granted upon a 
showing of “excusable neglect.”   
Thus, pursuant to Enos, a motion for extension filed in the 
second thirty days could only be granted if there was “neglect” 
that was “excusable.”     In other words, Enos used a two -part 
test:  (1) Was there neglect?  And if so, (2) Was the neglect 
excusable?  Enos appears to have used “within the movant’s 
control” as shorthand for whether or not there was ne glect, not 
for whether or not existing neglect was excusable.  With respect 
to determining whether existing “neglect” could be deemed 
“excusable,” Enos expressly adopted the equitable standard set 
forth by the United States Supreme Court in  Pioneer, and st ated, 
“reasons for failure to comply with a court -ordered deadline 
range from acts of God to a party’s choice to flout the deadline 
and that  ‘excusable neglect’ is not restricted to those **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
15 
 circumstances beyond a party’s control.”   80 Hawaiʻi at 352, 910 
P.2d at 123 (citing  Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick Assoc. 
Ltd. P’ship , 507 U.S. 380, 395 (1993)).   In other words, Enos 
clearly indicated that “neglect” could be “excusable” even if 
within a party’s control.      
Further addressing what would constitute  “excusable 
neglect” “within the control of the movant,” we also held that 
“only plausible misconstruction, but not mere ignorance, of the 
law or rules rises to the level of excusable neglect.”  Enos, 80 
Hawaiʻi at 353, 910 P.2d at 124.  In other words, Enos stated 
that the “neglectful” missing of an appeal deadline based on 
“plausible misconstruction” of law or rules could be 
“excusable.”  Under the specific circumstances of that case, 
however, we held that “ex cusable neglect” was not demonstrated 
by counsel’s failure to read and comply with the plain language 
of the applicable procedural rules, and that the trial court 
therefore abused its discretion in granting a motion to extend 
time to file a notice of appea l.  Enos, 80 Hawaiʻi at 355, 910 
P.2d at 126.  Then in Hall, also cited to by the ICA, we ruled 
that an attorney’s confusion or misunderstanding regarding the 
rule governing extension of time to file a notice of appeal did 
not constitute “excusable neglect .”  95 Hawaiʻi at 319, 22 P.3d 
at 966. **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
16 
 Foyt’s appeal was analyzed by the ICA for the existence of 
“excusable neglect.”   Although the circuit court found 
“excusable neglect” to exist, applying Enos and Hall, the ICA 
ruled that because counsel for Foyt had s poken to counsel for 
Eckard Brandes two days before the January 18, 2019 initial 
thirty-day deadline, and because Foyt presumably also could have 
moved to intervene earlier in the proceedings, the circuit court 
abused its discretion in granting an extensio n.  The Enos and 
Hall cases, however, are distinguishable from the situation at 
hand, and the ICA misconstrued our holding in Enos.  
Fundamentally, “the determination [of whether a party has shown 
‘excusable neglect’] is at bottom an equitable one, taking 
account of all relevant circumstances surrounding the party’s 
omission.”   Pioneer, 507 U.S. at  395.  Foyt was not a “party” 
until his motion to intervene was granted after it was filed by 
his newly retained attorney.5  In addition, according to Foyt’s 
submissions to the circuit court, he did not receive a copy of 
the December 19, 2018 circuit court fin al judgment until after 
Christmas of 2018, then spent several weeks searching for an 
attorney.  This was during the holiday period.  Although his 
prospective counsel spoke to counsel for Eckard Brandes two days 
before the deadline, Foyt was not able to off icially retain 
 
5  It appears that under HRS Chapter 91 and HRCP Rule 72, Foyt could have 
been included as a party.  Because this issue has not been briefed, we do not 
address it further at this time.   **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **

 counsel until January 17, 2019, one day before the initial 
thirty-day appeal filing deadline.  Counsel then filed motions 
to intervene and extend eight days later, and they were decided 
and granted by February 13, 2019.  Foyt’s notice of app eal to 
the ICA was filed two days later, before the additional thirty - 
day extended deadline had expired.  
 Thus, in this case, Foyt was not even a “party” when he 
received the circuit court’s final judgment.  His motion to 
intervene had to first be grante d by the circuit court before he 
could file a notice of appeal.  Also, there was no ignorance, 
misreading, confusion, or misunderstanding of the law.  After 
being retained the day before the initial thirty -day deadline 
expired, counsel for Foyt prepared a motion to intervene as well 
as a motion for extension under HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B).  To the 
extent these circumstances were within Foyt’s control, 
“excusable neglect” existed, and the circuit court did not abuse 
its discretion in granting the motion for exte nsion of time 
based on HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B).  The ICA therefore erred in 
dismissing Foyt’s appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.  
B. Changed circumstances require us to clarify “good cause” 
and “excusable neglect”  
 
 Our examination of this certiorari proceeding and HRAP Rule 
4(a)(4) causes us to clarify the Enos interpretations of “good 
cause” and “excusable neglect.”  When Enos was decided, all **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
18 
 motions to extend time for filing a notice of appeal were 
governed by one subsection of HRAP Rule 4(a), the HRAP Rule 
4(a)(5) quoted above.  At that time, the language of HRAP Rule 
4(a)(5) allowed for extensions of time to file notices of appeal 
based on “ good cause” or “excusable neglect,” whether or not a 
motion was filed within the first thirty days or within the next 
thirty days.   
In Enos, we held that pursuant to the language of the then -
existing HRAP Rule 4(a)(5), the “good cause” standard applied 
even if a motion to extend was not filed within the second 
thirty days.  80 Hawaiʻi at 350, 351, 910 P.2d at 121, 122.  We 
also held in Enos, however, that the “good cause” standard only 
applied if the reason for the extension was beyond the movant’s 
control.  80 Hawaiʻi at 352, 910 P.2d at 123.6  We conversely 
held that if a reason for requesting an extension was within the 
movant’s control, the motion could only be granted upon a 
showing of “excusable neglect.”  Id.  In doing so, however, Enos 
expressly ad opted the equitable standard set forth by the Court 
in Pioneer, indicating that the “neglectful” missing of an 
appeal deadline based on “plausible misconstruction” of law or 
 
6  If HRAP Rule 4(a)(5) still controlled, Foyt’s motion could therefore 
have been evaluated under the “good cause” standard for factors not within 
Foyt’s control, obviating the need to analyze this case under the “excusable 
neglect” standard for factors within Foyt’s control, which the ICA ruled did 
not exist.  
 **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
19 
 rules could be “excusable.”  We ruled that the facts of that 
case did not support a finding of “excusable neglect.”  
  After Enos, effective January 1, 2000, HRAP Rule 4(a) was 
amended, and the former HRAP Rule 4(a)(5) was split into the 
structure in which it now appears, with Rule 4( a)(4)(A) 
governing extensions of time within the first thirty days, 
requiring “good cause,” and Rule 4(a)(4)(B) governing extensions 
of time within the next thirty days, requiring “excusable 
neglect.”  Hall, 95 Hawaiʻi at 319 n.1, 22 P.3d 965 at n.1.7   
Thus, from that time, according to the plain language of HRAP 
Rule 4(a)(4), extension requests made within the first thirty 
days are governed by the “good cause” standard of subsection (A) 
 
7    HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)&(5) (eff. 2000), provided the following:  
 
(4)  Extensions of Time to File the Notice of Appeal.  
(A)  Requests for Extensions of Time Before Expiration of 
the Prescribed Time.   The court or agency appealed from, 
upon a showing of good cause , may ex tend the time for 
filing a notice of appeal upon motion filed within the time 
prescribed by subsections (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this 
rule.  However, no such extension shall exceed 30 days past 
such prescribed time.  An extension motion that is filed 
before the expiration of the prescribed time may be ex 
parte unless the court or agency otherwise requires.  
(B)  Requests for Extensions of Time After Expiration of 
the Prescribed Time.   The court or agency appeal[ed] from, 
upon a showing of excusable neglect , may extend the time 
for filing the notice of appeal upon motion filed not later 
than 30 days after the expiration of the time prescribed by 
subsections (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this rule.  However, 
no such extension shall exceed 30 days past the prescribed  
time.  Notice of an extension motion filed after the 
expiration of the prescribed time shall be given to the 
other parties in accordance with the rules of the court or 
agency appealed from.  
(Emphases added.)  **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
20 
 while requests made within the next thirty days are governed by 
the “excusable neglect” standard of subsection (B).    
Yet, as noted, before the split of HRAP Rule 4(a)(5) into 
Rule 4(a)(A) and (B), Enos had expanded the more lenient “good 
cause” standard to extension requests made in the second thirty 
days.  Since the spli t into two subsections, however, a motion 
to extend filed after expiration of the first thirty days and 
within thirty days thereafter can only be granted based on 
“excusable neglect,” which, by definition, must be a reason 
within the movant’s control.  The refore, if the reason for 
seeking an extension is not within the movant’s control, based 
on our interpretation of “excusable neglect” in Enos, an 
extension is not available.  For example, if a self -represented 
litigant is hospitalized or is otherwise incap acitated on the 
thirtieth day, just before a notice of appeal can be filed that 
day as planned, and the litigant is not able to file a motion to 
extend until after the thirtieth day, because the reason for 
seeking the extension was not within the litigant’ s control, 
“excusable neglect” would not exist.  And the “good cause” 
standard of HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(A), for reasons not within the 
litigant’s control, although clearly met, would not apply 
because the motion was filed after expiration of the first 
thirty d ays.              **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
21 
 Conversely, Enos held that the “good cause” standard, now 
applicable to motions filed within the first thirty days, 
applies only if the reason for requesting an extension is beyond 
the movant’s control.  Thus, if the reason for seeking an  
extension is within the movant’s control, an extension is not 
available if sought within the first thirty days.  For example, 
if the professional or personal schedule of a party or a party’s 
attorney makes it difficult to decide whether to file a notice 
of appeal by the end of the initial thirty days, an extension 
would not be available, as making such a decision is within the 
party’s control.  The same would hold true if a party or party’s 
attorney had a family trip, an elective surgery, or other 
professi onal or family circumstance that made the decision on 
whether to file an appeal difficult to make within the first 
thirty days.8   
The definitions of “good cause” and “excusable neglect” we 
adopted in Enos for purposes of the then -existing HRAP Rule 
4(a)(5), which construed a rule that allowed application of 
either standard whether an extension was sought within the first 
thirty days or the next thirty days, could therefore be 
 
8  The party or party’s attorney could file a m otion under HRAP Rule 
4(a)(4)(B) asserting “excusable neglect” for a reason within the party’s 
control after expiration of the first thirty days, but would be taking the 
risk it would be denied.  Yet, they would not meet the Enos definition of 
“good cause”  if they requested an extension within the first thirty days.  
 **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
22 (continued. . .)  
 misapplied to prevent those with good reasons to qualify for 
extensions.  In add ition, as in this case, and especially after 
the 2000 division of HRAP 4(a)(5) into two subsections, much 
litigation has ensued regarding whether “good cause” or 
“excusable neglect” exists.9   
Therefore, the splitting of the former HRAP Rule 4(a)(5) 
into subsections allowing extensions based only on “good cause”  
within the first thirty days and “excusable neglect” within the 
next thirty days10 has created possible unintended consequences.

10  This split has not happened in the federal rule.  As noted, in Enos, 
this court cited to federal cases construing “good cause” and “excusable 
neglect” for purposes of FRAP Rule 4(a)(5) in fashioning definitions of these 
terms.  FRAP Rule 4(a) (5) now provides as quoted below, and as can be seen, 
it allows for extensions based on “good cause” or “excusable neglect,” 
whether filed within the first thirty or the second thirty days; as did the 
HRAP Rule 4(a)(5) construed in Enos, it also continues the option of 
obtaining an extension within the first thirty days based on an ex parte 
motion: 
 
(5) Motion for Extension of Time.  
(A) The district court may extend the time to file a notice 
of appeal if:  
(i) a party so moves no later than 30 days after the time 
prescribed by this Rule 4(a) expires; and  **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
23 
 The split of HRAP Rule 4(a)(5) into two subsections after Enos 
has led to dismissals of appeals, as in this case, in derogation 
of “the policy of law . . . favor[ing] dispositions of 
litigation on the merits.”  Shasteen , 79 Hawaiʻi at 107, 899 P.2d 
at 390.  The changed circumstances therefore compel us to 
clarify the Enos definitions of “good cause” and “excusable 
neglect” for purposes of HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(A) and (B).   
Recently, in Chen v. Mah , 146 Hawaiʻi 157, 457 P.3d 796  
(2020), we addressed the “good cause” standard for purposes of a 
HRCP Rule 55(c) motion to set aside entry of default.  We noted 
that in the context of a Hawaiʻi Family Court Rules (“HFCR”) Rule 
59(a) motion for a new trial, Doe v. Doe  stated: 
“Good cause” . . . “depends upon the circumstances of the 
individual case, and a finding of its existence lies 
largely in the discretion of the officer or court to which 
[the] decision is committed.”  
 
 
(ii) regardless of whether its motion is filed before or 
during the 30 days after the time prescribed by this  Rule 
4(a) expires, that party shows excusable neglect or good 
cause. 
(B) A motion filed b efore the expiration of the time 
prescribed in Rule 4(a)(1) or (3) may be ex parte unless 
the court requires otherwise.  If the motion is filed after 
the expiration of the prescribed time, notice must be given 
to the other parties in accordance with local rules. 
(C) No extension under this Rule 4(a)(5) may exceed 30 days 
after the prescribed time or 14 days after the date when 
the order granting the motion is entered, whichever is 
later. 
 
Interestingly, it appears FRAP Rule 4(a)(C) allows the deadline to be  
extended beyond the second thirty days for up to an additional fourteen days, 
if a motion to extend is granted within the last fourteen days of the second 
thirty days.

24 (continued. . .)  
 Chen, 146 Hawaiʻi at 178, 457 P.3d at 817 (citing Doe v. Doe, 98 
Hawaiʻi 144, 154, 44 P.3d 1085, 1095 (2002) (citation omitted, 
brackets in original)).  We also noted that Doe also referred to 
a Black’s Law Dictionary  entry, stating that “ [t]he term 
‘good cause’ has been  defined to mean ‘a substantial reason 
amounting i n law to a legal excuse for failing to perform an act 
required by law[.]’”  Doe, 98 Hawaiʻi at 154, 44 P.3d at 1095 
(quoting Good Cause , Black’s Law Dictionary  (6th ed. 1990)).  
Chen, 146 Hawaiʻi at 178, n.22, 457 P.3d at 817, n.22.  We 
further pointed out that Black’s Law Dictionary now defines 
“good cause” as “[a] legally sufficient reason.”  Good cause is 
often the burden placed on a litigant (usu. by court rule or 
order) to show why a request  should be granted or an action 
excused.”  Id. (quoting Good Cause , Black’s Law Dictionary  (11th 
ed. 2019) ).       
Accordingly, we clarify that “good cause” is “a sufficient 
reason, depending upon the circumstances of the individual case, 
and that a findin g of its existence lies largely in the 
discretion of the court.”11       
 
11  In Chen, we ruled that for purposes of HRCP Rule 55(c)), if: (1) the 
defendant did not deliberately fail to plead or otherwise defend  or engage in 
contumacious conduct; or (b) if the defendant did deliberately fail to plead 
or otherwise defend or engage in contumacious conduct, there is no actual 
prejudice to the plaintiff that cannot be  addressed through lesser sanctions, 
then “good cause” should exist to set aside an entry of default.  Chen, 146 
Hawaiʻi at 180, 457 P.3d at 819.  We also construed our cases interpreting 
HRCP Rule 41(b)(2), which requires “good cause” to set aside a dismi ssal, as **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
25 
 Likewise, the plain language of the HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B) 
allows for an extension based on “excusable neglect.”  As noted 
earlier, Enos used a two -part test:  (1) Was there neglect?  And 
if so, (2) Was the neglect excusable?  Enos also appears to have 
used “within the movant’s control” as shorthand for whether or 
not there was neglect, not for whether or not existing neglect 
was excusable.  Because HRAP Rule 4 has been amended and miss ing 
a deadline now automatically triggers the “excusable neglect” 
standard, there is no need for courts to examine whether or not 
the reason for missing the deadline was within the movant’s 
control.  
Accordingly, as indicated by the United States Supreme 
Court in Pioneer, 507 U.S. 380, which was cited favorably in 
Enos,12 whether “excusable neglect” exists is “at bottom an 
equitable” decision; it is necessary to first determine whether 
there is “neglect,” and, if so, whether the “neglect” is 
 
holding by implication that “good cause” exists to set aside a dismissal 
under HRCP Rule 41(b)(2) if there is no (1) deliberate delay and/or 
contumacious conduct; or (2) if deliberate delay or contumacious conduct 
exist, there is no actual prejudi ce that cannot be addressed through lesser 
sanctions.  Id. 
 
12  As further discussed in note 13, infra, Pioneer construed “excusable 
neglect” for purposes of Bankruptcy Rule 9006(b)(1), which empowered a 
bankruptcy court to permit a late filing if the movan t’s failure to comply 
with an earlier deadline was the result of excusable neglect; the rule did 
not contain “good cause” language.  Enos, 80 Hawaiʻi at 352 & n.2, 910 P.2d at 
116 & n.2.  Interestingly, we noted that the Court interpreted “excusable 
neglect” to include both intervening circumstances beyond a party’s control 
and neglect on the part of a party,  Enos, 80 Hawaiʻi at 352, 910 P.2d at 116, 
but we still adopted definitions differentiating “good cause” and “excusable 
neglect” on these bases.  
  **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
26 
 “excusable.”  507 U.S. at 393 -94.13  As also noted, w ith respect 
to determining whether existing “neglect” could be deemed 
“excusable,” Enos expressly adopted the equitable standard set 
forth by the United States Supreme Court in  Pioneer, and stated, 
“reasons for failure  to comply with a court -ordered deadline 
range from acts of God to a party’s choice to flout the deadline 
and . . . ‘excusable neglect’ is not restricted to those 
circumstances beyond a party’s control.”   We therefore clarify 
that, as indicated in Enos, “excusable neglect” is to be 
construed pursuant to its plain language:  “neglect” that is 
 
13  As discussed in David N. May, Pioneer’s Paradox:  Appellate Rule 
4(a)(5) and the Rule Against Excusing Ignorance of Law , 48 Drake L. Rev 677 
(2000) (“May”), although Pioneer interpreted “excusable neglect” in the 
context of Bankruptcy Rule 9006, the opinion ended up impacting the 
definition of “excusable neglect” for purposes of FRAP Rule 4(a)(5).  May, at 
680-81.  The Court’s definition of “excusable neglect” “advanced a new , 
‘flexible understanding’ of excusable neglect[,]” and posited that 
“[d]eterminations of whether neglect is excusable should involve a broad, 
equitable, inquiry.”  May, at 1 (citing Pioneer, 507 U.S. at 389).  Yet, as 
further discussed in the article:  
 
During the same years in which the circuits anointed 
Pioneer as their guiding star, a second trend was also 
developing.  Strangely, this second trend can be viewed as 
contrary to Pioneer.  Specifically, in the years since 
Pioneer, seven different circuits ha ve held that a mistake 
or ignorance of plain law cannot be excusable neglect under 
Rule 4(a)(5).  Notwithstanding judicial acceptance of 
Pioneer’s broad equitable inquiry, the circuit courts have 
continued to apply the ancient maxim that ignorance or 
mistakes of plain law cannot excuse.  [sic]  The circuit 
courts have accepted Pioneer’s prescription that “all 
relevant circumstances” must be taken into account; yet, 
the same courts continue to hold that “‘[t]he excusable 
neglect standard can never be met by a showing of inability 
or refusal to read and comprehend the plain language of the 
federal rules.”’  
 
May, at 681 (internal footnotes omitted).  Despite Enos citing favorably to 
Pioneer, that opinion, as well as Hall, favored the stricter interpretation 
of “excusable neglect” noted in the quotation above.

 “excusable,” which, “involve[s] a broad, equitable, inquiry”   
“taking into account all relevant circumstances surroun ding the 
party’s omission.”  Pioneer, 507 U.S. at 389, 393 -94.  As with 
“good cause,” the determination of whether “excusable neglect” 
exists should lie largely in the discretion of the court.  
Our clarifications of “good cause” and “excusable neglect” 
should reduce litigation over whether “good cause” or “excusable 
neglect” exists for purposes of HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(A) and (B) and 
advance “the policy of law [that] favors dispositions of

 For the reasons stated above, we vacate the ICA’s May 21, 
2019 “Order Dismissing Appellate Court Case Number CAAP -19-

to the ICA to address the merits of the appeal.
