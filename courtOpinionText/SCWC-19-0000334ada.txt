2 Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1) (2014), after a bench trial in 
the District Court of the First Circuit.1   
During Kwong’s motion for judgment of acquittal, and 
again during closing arguments, Kwong’s attorney asked the 
district court to take judicial notice that 60 miles per hour 
(mph) is equivalent to 88 feet per second as a matter that is 
generally known.2  The district court appeared to conclude that 
it could not take judicial notice of the conversion between mph and feet per second and that Kwong would have to present expert testimony.  The court found Kwong guilty of OVUII, and the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) affirmed.   
We agree with Kwong that the court was required to 
take judicial notice that 30 mph is equivalent to 44 feet per 
second.  The “necessary information” requirement in Hawai‘ i Rules 
of Evidence (HRE) Rule 201(d) requires a party to provide enough 
information for the court to determine whether judicial notice 
is proper.  HRE Rule 201(d) cmt.  If a fact is generally known 
or a matter of common knowledge, a party need not provide 
additional information to justify judicial notice.  21B Charles 
Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Kenneth W. Graham, Jr., Federal 
                     
1   The Honorable William M. Domingo presided.  
 
2  Kwong’s attorney also explained that from this fact, the district 
court could extrapolate that 30 mph is the equivalent of 44 feet per second 
because 30 mph is half of 60 mph.   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
3 Practice and Procedure § 5107.1 n.35 (2d ed. 2020).  Here, all 
the facts needed to infer 44 feet per second from 30 mph — 5280 
feet in a mile, 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a 
minute — are common knowledge, and the math to convert mph to 
feet per second is straightforward.  Thus, judicial notice of 
this fact was mandatory. 
Nevertheless, since taking judicial notice would not 
have affected the outcome of this case, any error was harmless.  
Kwong’s other issues are without merit.  Accordingly, we affirm Kwong’s conviction.  
II.  BACKGROUND 
 
In July 2017, the State charged Kwong with OVUII in 
violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1).
3  The case proceeded to a bench 
trial in March 2018.   
A. District Court Trial 
1. Officer Wong’s Testimony 
  Honolulu Police Department Officer Josh Wong testified 
                     
3   HRS § 291E- 61(a)(1) provides:  
 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle 
under the influence of an intoxicant if the person 
operates or assumes actual physical control of a 
vehicle: 
 
(1) While under the influence of alcohol in an amount sufficient to impair the person’s normal 
mental faculties or ability to care for the 
person and guard against casualty[.] 
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
4 on behalf of the State.  At approximately 3:30 A.M. on June 23, 
2017, Officer Wong stopped Kwong for an unsafe lane change 
violation.  Officer Wong had been in the left lane traveling 
eastbound on Kapiolani Boulevard about two-and-a-half car 
lengths behind a pickup truck.  Kwong had been in the right 
lane.  They were both traveling between 30 and 40 mph.  
 
When they were approximately 30 feet from the 
intersection of Kapiolani Boulevard and Isenberg Street, Kwong 
abruptly cut from the right lane of Kapiolani across the middle lane and into the far-left lane, without using a turn signal.  
She pulled in front of Officer Wong and behind the pickup truck, 
which had been starting to make a left turn onto Isenberg 
Street.  Officer Wong testified, “[I]n order to avoid a rear-end 
collision[,] I slammed on my brakes.  At that point, whatever 
was on my seat that wasn’t fastened, all the stuff went onto the 
floorboard.”   
On cross-examination, Officer Wong affirmed the times 
and distances involved:  
Q.  And this all happened in less than 30 feet, going 30 
miles an hour? 
 
A.  Yes. 
 Q.  Do you know how many feet you travel at 30 miles per 
hour in one second? 
 
A.  No. 
 Q.  It’s 44. 
 So you’re saying that this vehicle, in the amount of ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
5 time it took to go 30 feet, which would take -- God -- less 
than two thirds of a second, was able to go from Lane 1 to 
Lane 3? 
 
A.  Yeah. 
 
After crossing into the left lane of Kapiolani 
Boulevard, Kwong turned left onto Isenberg Street.  Officer Wong 
followed her and activated his lights.  Kwong pulled over 
immediately.   
Officer Wong approached Kwong’s car and told her he 
pulled her over for an unsafe lane change.  Kwong apologized and told him she had changed her mind at the last minute.  While 
Kwong was talking, Officer Wong noted several indicia of 
intoxication: he could smell a “very strong odor of alcohol 
coming from her breath”; Kwong’s eyes were “red, kind of 
bloodshot, and glassy”; and her speech was slurred.  
Accordingly, Officer Wong asked her to participate in standardized field sobriety tests (SFSTs).  Kwong responded, 
“Yeah, it’s okay.  I did have a couple of drinks,” and got out 
of the car.  Officer Wong testified that Kwong stumbled after 
getting out of her vehicle.   
Kwong did the walk-and-turn and one-leg-stand tests on 
the road, which was flat and partially lit.  Officer Wong 
testified that he had to “go over the instructions for each test 
at least two to three times before she understood.”  During the ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
6 instructional stage of the walk-and-turn test — when Kwong was 
supposed to stand still with her feet aligned heel-to-toe — she 
had been “unable to maintain her balance three times.”  
Ultimately, Kwong did not perform the test properly, missing 
heel-to-toe, stepping off the line, and raising her arms for 
balance several times.  According to Officer Wong, Kwong also 
did not perform the one-leg-stand test properly.  Throughout the 
test, she swayed from side to side, raised her arms, and had to 
put her foot down once.  After the conclusion of the SFSTs, Officer Wong arrested Kwong for OVUII.   
2. 
Motion for Judgment of Acquittal After Officer Wong testified, Kwong’s counsel moved 
for a judgment of acquittal and the following exchange occurred:   
[COUNSEL]: In the light most favorable to the State -- and 
I’m going to have to ask the judge to take judicial notice 
of something.  In -- physics never changes.  If you’ re 
going 60 miles per hour, you’ re going 88 feet per second.  
It never changes.  It’ s a constant.  It’ s like there’ s 12 
inches in a foot. 
 
THE COURT: Yeah.  I -- I can’t take judicial notice of 
that. 
 
[COUNSEL]: Why? 
 
THE COURT: You -- you want an expert, you bring an expert. 
 
[COUNSEL]: It’ s not an expert.  It’ s like 12 inches in a foot. 
Everybody knows it.  It’s like the sun comes up in the morning 
from the east. 
 
THE COURT: Right, right. Keep -- continue.  Continue. 
 [COUNSEL]: Okay.  So if a car travels 88 feet every second 
at 60 miles per hour, at 30 feet it’s going to travel 44 
feet in one second.  He’s saying that this person drove ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
7 from Lane 1 to Lane 3.  He was 30 feet from the 
intersection, traveling approximately 35 miles per hour, 
even if he’ s slowing down, and got in front of him before 
he reached the intersection.  It’s physically impossible, 
based on his testimony, for that to happen.  It could not 
happen.  There would have been a crash.  He could not have 
slowed down in one second and avoided that collision.  That’s not what happened, because it’ s physically 
impossible to happen.  It can’t happen.  It could not have 
happened as he testified. 
 
THE COURT: Okay.  What else? 
 
The district court denied Kwong’s motion for 
acquittal: 
THE COURT: Okay. 
 
All right.  In review of -- of the one witness that we had, 
getting to your point as far as whether or not -- the 
testimony of Officer Wong was that he was driving along, going on Kapiolani, and there was a truck in front of him 
about to make a left turn into Isenberg, noticed the 
defendant’s car to the far right, and his testimony was 
that she cut in front of him.  He had to brake in order to avoid a collision.  Physics aside at this point, I don’ t 
have any expert as far as what’s going -- but that’s his 
testimony.  And it’ s also corroborated by the fact that 
when he explained to her why he pulled her over, Defendant in her own statement said, I’ m sorry; I’ve decided too 
late, I believe, you know, to make a decision.  So that is 
consistent with his statement that she cut in front of him, 
and he had to avoid the collision and step on his brakes.  
He also testified that all of the -- whatever things he had 
on the front seat, because he had to brake suddenly, were 
taken off the seat and, I guess, pushed to the front of his 
car. 
 . . . . 
 
So
 based on that, in the light most favorable, I’ ll deny 
your motion for judgment of acquittal. 
 
3. Kwong’s Testimony 
Kwong testified that on June 23, 2017, she had been 
driving a friend home.  Her friend had been giving her 
directions and told her to turn at the last minute, and Kwong ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
8 admitted cutting across two lanes on Kapiolani to make the turn.  
However, Kwong disputed Officer Wong’s testimony that the lane 
change had been so abrupt he had to slam on his brakes.   
Kwong also controverted Officer Wong’s testimony that 
she had stumbled exiting her car.  She testified that she was 
wearing high-heeled boots and that her heel caught on the edge 
of the door briefly when she got out, but that she did not 
“stumble.”  Kwong contended that her high heels also made it 
difficult to perform the SFSTs.  However, Kwong took the boots off for the one-leg-stand test. 
  
On cross-examination, Kwong testified that her friend 
worked at a bar and Kwong had spent approximately four-and-a-
half hours at the bar waiting for her friend to get off work.  
She drank while at the bar — she had one beer with pizza and 
“sipped” on three shots of whiskey over the course of the night.   
4. Closing Arguments and Verdict 
In his closing, Kwong’s counsel incorporated the 
argument he had made in support of Kwong’s motion for judgment 
of acquittal.  He contended, “[I]t’s still the Defense’s 
position that the officer’s testimony is not credible, because 
it’s physically impossible to have occurred what he testified 
to.”   
The district court found Kwong guilty: “[B]ased on the ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
9 testimony of Officer Wong, looking at the -- the driving itself, 
and her performance on the field sobriety test, the Court finds 
that Ms. Kwong -- or the State has proven beyond a reasonable 
doubt that Ms. Kwong was impaired by alcohol.”  The district 
court made no findings regarding the distances or speeds to 
which Officer Wong had testified, and it did not address Kwong’s 
prior request for judicial notice.  
 
5. The ICA’s Summary Disposition Order 
On appeal, Kwong argued the district court erred in 
refusing to take judicial notice of the fact that 30 mph is the 
same as 44 feet per second.  Kwong contended, “Had the court 
taken judicial notice as requested that 30 mph is 44 [feet] per 
second, it would have been evident to the court that the 
officer’s testimony was not credible.”   
She also asked the ICA to take judicial notice of an 
aerial map depicting the intersection of Kapiolani Boulevard and Isenberg Street.  Kwong did not provide a source for the image.  
On the map, Kwong marked the locations of Kwong’s car, Officer 
Wong’s car, and the pickup truck that was turning left and the 
widths of the middle-left and left lanes.   
The ICA affirmed Kwong’s conviction.  First, the ICA 
observed that “it does not appear the District Court ultimately 
rejected Kwong’s judicial notice request,” noting that although ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
10 the district court initially declined to take
 judicial notice, 
the court “appeared agreeable when defense counsel explained why 
judicial notice would be appropriate[.]”  
Second, the ICA held that the district court was not 
required to take judicial notice that 30 mph is the equivalent 
of 44 feet per second under HRE Rules 201(b) and (d).  The 
district court had the discretion to take judicial notice of 
such a fact because “it is ‘capable of accurate and ready 
determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned,’ and the mathematical computation 
leading to that result is indisputable.”  However, according to 
the ICA, a trial court “is required to take judicial notice of 
an adjudicative fact only ‘if requested by a party and supplied 
with the necessary information.’”  Thus, citing Drake v. 
Holstead, 757 S.W.2d 909, 911 (Tex. App. 1988), the ICA 
concluded that Kwong “should have supplied the District Court with some means to verify the figures for which she sought 
judicial notice.”   
Third, the ICA concluded that even if the district 
court had erred in refusing to take judicial notice that 30 mph 
is 44 feet per second, the error was harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt.  Kwong cross-examined Officer Wong about the 
fact that 30 mph is 44 feet per second and referenced that ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
11 number in her arguments.   
In a footnote, the ICA refused to take judicial notice 
of the map in Kwong’s opening brief because “Kwong did not 
supply this court with the ‘necessary information’ to verify the 
annotated map’s accuracy, including the source of the map.”  
Further, the ICA held there were no equitable grounds for taking 
judicial notice of a map that was not introduced below or part 
of the record on appeal.   
Finally, the ICA observed that “the crux of Kwong’s 
argument on appeal is to question the District Court’s credibility determinations.”  Credibility determinations are for 
the trial judge, not the appellate court.  Because “[t]he 
District Court clearly found Officer Wong credible at least as 
to the testimony the court expressly relied upon,” the ICA 
concluded, “[o]n this record, we will not disturb the District 
Court’s implicit finding that Officer Wong was credible.”   
III.  STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
 
A. 
Judicial Notice  
“When application of a particular evidentiary rule can 
yield only one correct result, the proper standard for appellate 
review is the right/wrong standard.”  State v. West, 95 Hawai‘ i 
22, 25, 18 P.3d 884, 887 (2001) (quoting State v. Staley, 91 
Hawai‘i 275, 281, 982 P.2d 904, 910 (1999)) (applying right/wrong ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
12 standard to question of mandatory judicial notice).  
B. 
Credibility of Witnesses 
 
It is for the trial judge as fact- finder to assess the 
credibility of witnesses and to resolve all questions of 
fact; the judge may accept or reject any witness’s 
testimony in whole or in part.  Lono v. State, 63 Haw. 470, 
473, 629 P.2d 630, 633 (1981).  As the trier of fact, the judge may draw all reasonable and legitimate inferences and 
deductions from the evidence, and the findings of the trial court will not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous.  Id. 
at 473–74, 629 P.2d at 633.  An appellate court will not 
pass upon the trial judge’s decisions with respect to the 
credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence, 
because this is the province of the trial judge. 
 
State v. Eastman, 81 Hawai‘ i 131, 139, 913 P.2d 57, 65 (1996).   
IV.  DISCUSSION 
In her application for writ of certiorari, Kwong 
argues that the district court erred by failing to take judicial 
notice of (1) the fact that 30 mph equals 44 feet per second and 
(2) an aerial photograph of the intersection in question.  
Additionally, she contends that the ICA erred in declining to 
review Officer Wong’s testimony when his testimony “contradicted 
the laws of physics[.]”    
  As explained below, the district court was required to 
take judicial notice that 30 mph equals 44 feet per second, but 
Kwong’s other issues are without merit. 
A. Judicial Notice  
HRE Rule 201 governs judicial notice of adjudicative  
  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
13 facts4 and provides in relevant part:  
(b) Kinds of facts.  A judicially noticed fact must be 
one not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is 
either (1) generally known within the territorial 
jurisdiction of the trial court, or (2) capable of 
accurate and ready determination by resort to sources 
whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned. 
 
(c) When discretionary.  A court may take judicial 
notice, whether requested or not. 
 (d) When mandatory.  A court shall take judicial notice if requested by a party and supplied with the 
necessary information. 
 
The purpose of the judicial notice doctrine is 
twofold.  First, it promotes efficiency by eliminating “the 
necessity of taking the time of the court and jury to make 
formal proof of a fact which cannot be disputed[.]”  State v. 
Moses, 102 Hawai‘ i 449, 454, 77 P.3d 940, 945 (2003) (quoting In 
re Estate of Herbert, 90 Hawai‘ i at 466, 979 P.2d at 62).  
Second, it promotes the legitimacy of the courts by ensuring that decisions are not “contrary to what is accepted as 
indisputable fact[.]”  21B Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller 
& Kenneth W. Graham, Jr., Federal Practice and Procedure § 5102 
(2d ed. 2020) (quoting Edmund M. Morgan, Judicial Notice, 57 
Harv. L. Rev. 269, 273 (1944)).  For that reason, 
“[c]ourts . . . may not shut their minds to truths that all 
                     
4   An “adjudicative fact” is “the kind of fact[] that [is] 
ordinarily decided by the trier of fact; for example, who did what to whom, 
when, where, how, and why.”  In re Estate of Herbert, 90 Hawai‘ i 443, 466, 979 
P.2d 39, 62 (1999) (quoting State v. Kwak, 80 Hawai‘ i 297, 306, 909 P.2d 1112, 
1121 (1995)).  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
14 others can see and understand, and are not at liberty to 
entirely disregard facts of general knowledge.  Hence, the rule 
governing judicial notice is mandatory when it applies[.]”  29 
Am. Jur. 2d Evidence § 37 (2021) (footnotes omitted) (citing, 
inter alia, United States v. Butler, 297 U.S. 1, 61 (1936)).  
1. The ICA Erred in Concluding that Trial Courts Are Not 
Required to Take Judicial Notice of Equivalent 
Measurements Unless Provided with the Mathematical 
Equation for Conversion 
 
A fact may be judicially noticed if it is either “(1) 
generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial 
court, or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by 
resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be 
questioned.”  HRE Rule 201(b); see also Uyeda v. Schermer, 144 
Hawai‘i 163, 172, 439 P.3d 115, 124 (2019) (“[A] fact is a proper 
subject for judicial notice if it is common knowledge or easily 
verifiable.” (quoting Almeida v. Correa, 51 Haw. 594, 605, 465 
P.2d 564, 572 (1970))).  The ICA correctly observed that the conversion of mph to feet per second is proper for judicial 
notice because it is indisputable:  
[T]he fact that 30 mph is the equivalent of 44 feet per 
second is proper for judicial notice under [HRE] Rule 
201(b) (2016), in that it is “capable of accurate and ready 
determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot 
reasonably be questioned,” and the mathematical computation leading to that result is indisputable. 
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
15 Nevertheless, the ICA held that judicial notice was 
not mandated because Kwong did not provide the court with the 
“necessary information” as required by HRE Rule 201(d): “To the 
extent the conversion of 30 mph to feet per second requires 
mathematical calculations, Kwong should have supplied the 
District Court with some means to verify the figures for which 
she sought judicial notice.”  We disagree.   
This court has previously only addressed the question 
of mandatory judicial notice under HRE Rule 201(d) with respect to court records.  In State v. Akana, 68 Haw. 164, 165–66, 706 
P.2d 1300, 1302 (1985), we held the trial court was required to judicially notice court records upon request because the files 
were in the court’s possession and could not be questioned.  
Noting that HRE Rule 201(d) requires a party to provide the 
necessary information, we found that requirement satisfied 
because the court had ready access to its own records, although they had not been provided by the parties.  Id.  We reaffirmed 
this interpretation of HRE Rule 201(d) in a footnote in Oahu 
Publications, Inc. v. Abercrombie, 134 Hawai‘ i 16, 20 n.3, 332 
P.3d 159, 163 n.3 (2014), where we observed that the ICA was required to take judicial notice of records upon request because 
the ICA had access to the records through the Judiciary 
Information Management System.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
16 Although we have never addressed the question of 
mandatory judicial notice with respect to other facts, Akana and 
Oahu Publications demonstrate that the “necessary information” 
requirement in HRE Rule 201(d) is not intended to be a 
formalistic hurdle — if the court has ready access to the 
information that is to be judicially noticed, then it has the 
necessary information to make notice mandatory.  In other words, 
the “necessary information” requirement of HRE Rule 201(d) means 
that a party must provide enough information for a court to determine whether judicial notice is proper under HRE Rule 
201(b).   
Thus, to satisfy the mandates of HRE Rule 201(d), a 
party must (1) request the court take judicial notice, and (2) 
provide enough information to establish that the fact is either 
generally known or capable of accurate and ready determination.  
HRE Rule 201 cmt. (“Should the court fail to take discretionary judicial notice of an adjudicative fact, . . . such notice is 
mandated upon request of a party, provided the party supplies 
the court with data consistent with the requirement of 
subsection (b).”); 31A C.J.S. Evidence § 17 (2021) (party 
requesting notice must provide the court with “sufficient source material to allow the court to determine whether taking judicial 
notice is warranted”).   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
17 Here, Kwong argued that it is generally known that 60 
mph is the equivalent of 88 feet per second, just as twelve 
inches is equivalent to one foot.  Kwong’s attorney then 
explained that from that fact, the district court could 
extrapolate that 30 mph is the equivalent of 44 feet per second, 
since 30 mph is half of 60 mph.   
To satisfy HRE Rule 201(d)’s “necessary information” 
requirement for facts that are generally known, a party need 
only state that the fact should be noticed as a matter of common knowledge: “[O]ne need not provide a ‘source’ for a generally 
known fact.”
5  21B Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & 
Kenneth W. Graham, Jr., Federal Practice and Procedure § 5107.1 
n.35 (2d ed. 2020); see also id. at § 5108.   
A fact is common knowledge if it “is so commonly known 
in the community as to make it unprofitable to require proof, 
and so certainly known as to make it indisputable among reasonable people.”  2 Kenneth S. Broun et al., McCormick On 
Evidence § 329 (Robert P. Mosteller ed., 8th ed. 2020) (footnote 
                     
5   At a bare minimum, the request [for judicial notice] should 
specify precisely the adjudicative fact that the court should 
notice, state whether tha[t] fact can be noticed as a matter of 
common knowledge, and, if not, cite the court to some source of 
reasonably indisputable accuracy in which the noticed fact may be 
found.   
 
21B Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Kenneth W. Graham, Jr., Federal

18 omitted).  In this analysis, courts look to whether the fact is 
generally known to a “person of ordinary understanding and 
observation.”  State v. Arena, 46 Haw. 315, 341, 379 P.2d 594, 
609 (1963) (citation omitted); see also 2 Kenneth S. Broun, et 
al., McCormick On Evidence § 329 (Robert P. Mosteller ed., 8th 
ed. 2020) (“[T]he more reflective opinions speak in terms of ‘what well-informed persons generally know’ or ‘the knowledge 
that every intelligent person has.’” (footnotes omitted)).   
A judge need not personally know or remember the fact 
in question for it to be common knowledge; accordingly, the court can refer to other sources to aid their analysis.  Pua v.

2020).  Thus, to some extent, whether a fact is “common 
knowledge” depends on the ease with which it can be ascertained: if the truth of a fact is apparent after only a cursory 
examination, it is likely “common knowledge.”  See Arena, 46 
Haw. at 343, 379 P.2d at 610 (“[A]s a matter of common knowledge[,] a court may take judicial notice that under normal 
conditions an automobile may be stopped within certain distance 
limits.”).   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
19 A fact may also be common knowledge if it can be 
derived “by a process of combining facts that are generally 
known” using mathematics.  21B Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. 
Miller & Kenneth W. Graham, Jr., Federal Practice and Procedure 
§ 5105 (2d ed. 2020) (discussing “combinatorial common  
knowledge”).  Courts regularly use basic math to take judicial  
notice of facts that might otherwise not be common knowledge.  
E.g., People v. Bradley
, 183 Cal. Rptr. 434, 437 n.6 (Cal. Ct.  
App. 1982) (“We judicially notice the mathematical truth of a  
12” x 12” opening having a 17” diagonal.”); Allen v. Indus.  
Comm’n, 729 P.2d 15, 17 n.1 (Utah 1986) (“We take judicial  
notice that liquid milk weighs about the same as liquid water or
approximately 8 ⅓ pounds per gallon.   Thus, four gallons of milk
weigh about 33 pounds without the containers and crate.”);  
Miller v. Fed. Land Bank of Spokane, 587 F.2d 415, 422 (9th Cir.
1978) (holding that trial court must take judicial notice of a  
reduction in mortgage debt because “[t]his is a matter of  
mathematics, of which the court could and should have taken  
judicial notice”).   
 
 
As relevant here, numerous courts have concluded that 
the conversion of mph into feet per second is a matter of “mere 
mathematical calculation” and have taken judicial notice of the ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
20 conversion rate as a matter of common knowledge.   Davidian v. 
Wendell, 37 So. 2d 570, 574 (Miss. 1948) (“[We] know as a matter 
of mere mathematical calculation that at 30 miles per hour a car 
travels 44 feet per second[.]”); see also Mallard v. Earl, 665 
A.2d 287, 295 n.6 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1995) (“We observe that a 
speed range of 35 to 40 miles per hour is equivalent to a range 
of 51 to 58 feet per second.  To be sure, the testimony referred 
to speeds only in miles per hour, not in feet per second.  We 
note, though, that the conversion can be easily calculated[.]”).   6
The two jurisdictions to consider whether the 
conversion of mph to feet per second must be judicially noticed, 
Wisconsin and Texas, have concluded that judicial notice is 
mandatory.  In Schmiedeck v. Gerard, the Wisconsin Supreme Court 
held that a trial court abused its discretion7 by refusing to 
take judicial notice of the conversion from mph into feet per 
                     
6   Many other courts have taken judicial notice of the conversion of 
mph to feet per second without a source or analysis, implying that such 
conversions are matters of common knowledge.  E.g., Greyhound Corp. v. 
Sparks, 283 F.2d 44, 48 (5th Cir. 1960) (noting that the car was traveling at  
“a speed no less than 40 miles per hour (nearly 60 feet per second)”); 
Eggleston v. Louisiana & A. Ry. Co., 192 So. 774, 780 (La. Ct. App. 1939) 
(observing that “[t]he machine traveled 60 miles per hour or 88 feet per 
second”); De Lay v. Ward, 262 S.W.2d 628, 635 (Mo. 1953) (“If defendant was 
traveling at 10 miles per hour, he was moving at the rate of 14.66 feet per second.”). 
 
7   Schmiedeck was decided before the rule of mandatory judicial 
notice, Wis. Stat. § 902.01(4) (1974), was enacted, and therefore the court 
used the abuse of discretion standard.  But the 1974 Judicial Council 
Committee’s Notes for Wis. Stat. § 902.01(4) suggest that judicial notice in 
Schmiedeck was mandatory because the adjudicative facts were “indisputable.” ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
21 second, saying “[t]his is not a complex computation.”  166 
N.W.2d 136, 139–40 (Wis. 1969).  Notably, the court did not 
require the plaintiff to provide the court with the applicable 
equations, instead construing plaintiff’s request “that the 
trial court take judicial notice that a vehicle traveling 20 
miles per hour would be moving approximately 29 feet per second” 
as a request “that the trial court take judicial notice of facts 
necessary to convert miles per hour into feet per second[.]”  
Id. at 138-39. 
The ICA cited Drake to support its conclusion that a 
party needs to provide the court with the necessary equations before it is required to take judicial notice.  In Drake, the 
trial court refused to take judicial notice of how far a car going 40 mph would travel in 3.6 seconds, telling the plaintiff, 
“[t]hat takes testimony[.]”  757 S.W.2d at 910.  The Texas Court 
of Appeals held to the contrary, explaining that “[o]nce the number of minutes in an hour, seconds in a minute, and feet in a 
mile are ascertained,[
8] it is a matter of simple mathematical 
computation to arrive at the number of feet traveled in a second by an object traveling at a given rate per mile.”  Id. at 911.   
The ICA presumably relied on the fact that the Drake  
                     
8   The court noted that the number of feet in a mile is a matter of 
general knowledge.  Id. at 911. 
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
22 opinion shows the equations necessary to deduce how many feet 
per second a car travels if it is going 40 and 50 mph and that 
the Texas Court of Appeals emphasized that “[a] party seeking 
mandatory judicial notice must supply the court with the 
‘necessary information.’”  Id.  However, contrary to the ICA’s 
assumption, the plaintiff in Drake did not supply the trial 
court with the distance/time calculations at the time the court 
made its ruling — she filed them after trial in her bill of 
exceptions.   Id. (“In her bill of exceptions, plaintiff supplied 
the court with a sheet of typewritten computations[.]”); id. at 
910 (quoting the transcript of the proceeding, in which the 
plaintiff did not provide the court with the applicable 
equations). 9
This court previously recognized in an analogous 
context that unit conversion may be a matter of common knowledge 
if the values needed for the calculation are commonly known.  
State v. Mattiello, 90 Hawai ‘i 255, 262 n.9, 978 P.2d 693, 700 
n.9 (1999).  In Mattiello, we held that to meet its burden, the  
State needed to adduce evidence “regarding the conversion of  
milliliters to fluid ounces” because “we expect that few among
9A party files a bill of exception with the trial court after 
trial in order 
“to complain on appeal about a matter that would not otherwise 
appear in the record. ”  Tex. R. App. P. 33.2 (1997).  The bill must be filed 
“no later than 30 days after the filing party’s notice of appeal is filed[.]” 
Id.   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
23           (continued . . .) 
 us could be expected independently to recall that there are 
29.573 milliliters in a fluid ounce.”  Id.  However, we also 
noted that measurement conversion may be considered common 
knowledge if the underlying numbers are commonly known, “such as
the conversion from avoirdupois[ ] ounces to pounds.”  Id.    10 
Here, as the courts in Wisconsin and Texas recognized, 
all the facts involved in converting mph into feet per second — 
5280 feet in a mile, 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a 
minute — are matters of common knowledge.  Schmiedeck, 166 
N.W.2d at 139; Drake, 757 S.W.2d at 911.  Similarly, the math to 
convert mph into feet per second is straightforward.  Because this is a matter of general knowledge, Kwong did not need to 
show the district court how to convert 60 mph into feet per 
second, and the ICA erred in concluding the district court did 
not have the necessary information to make judicial notice 
mandatory.  
It appears that the district court declined to take 
judicial notice of this conversion.11  Nevertheless, the ICA 
                     
10   The avoirdupois measurement system is the American customary 
system for measuring weight, in which there are 16 ounces to a pound.  An 
avoirdupois ounce is distinguished from a fluid ounce and other forms of 
measurement that also use the term “ounce.”  Avoirdupois weight measurement 
system, Encyclopedia Britannica, https://perma.cc/V8FP- EEVY.  
 
11  As the ICA recognized, it is not entirely clear that the district 
court refused to take judicial notice.  Nevertheless, when the transcript is  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
24 correctly concluded that any error was harmless.  As discussed 
below, the district court was entitled to believe Officer Wong’s 
testimony about Kwong’s indicia of intoxication and her 
performance on the SFSTs even if the officer’s estimates about 
the parties’ speed and distance from the intersection were not 
credible.  The court was also entitled to believe portions of 
Officer Wong’s testimony even if other portions were not 
credible.  See Dietz v. Consol. Oil & Gas, Inc., 643 F.2d 1088, 
1094 n.2 (5th Cir. 1981) (explaining that even if the court judicially noticed facts that undermined a witness’s testimony, 
viewed in its entirety, it appears the district court did decline to do so.  
After Kwong’s counsel asked the district court to take judicial notice that 
“[i]f you’re going 60 miles per hour, you’re going 88 feet per second,” the 
following exchange occurred: 
THE COURT: Yeah.  I 
-- I can’t take judicial notice of 
that. 
[COUNSEL]: Why? 
THE COURT: You -- you want an expert, you bring an expert.
 
[COUNSEL]: It’ s not an expert.  It’ s like 12 inches in a foot. 
Everybody knows it.
  It’s like the sun comes up in the morning 
from the east. 
THE COURT: Right, right. 
Keep --
 continue.  Continue. 
Kwong’s counsel then explained that, given this conversion, the 
events described by Officer Wong were “physically impossible.”  The district 
court responded, “Okay.  What else?”  Thus, it appears that the court was 
simply acknowledging the argument without actually adopting it.
   
Likewise, in ruling on Kwong’s motion for judgment of acquittal, 
the court stated
, “Physics aside at this point, I don’t have any expert as 
far as what’s going -- but that’s [Officer Wong’s] testimony.”  I n context, 
the comment about not having “any expert” implies that the court thought expert testimony was needed to take judicial notice. ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
25 the court could not use those facts to draw the inference that 
the witness was not credible, since the factfinder determines 
credibility); see also Eastman, 81 Hawai ‘i at 139, 913 P.2d at 65 
(“An appellate court will not pass upon the trial judge's 
decisions with respect to the credibility of witnesses and the 
weight of the evidence, because this is the province of the 
trial judge.”); State v. Jhun, 83 Hawai ‘i 472, 483, 927 P.2d 
1355, 1366 (1996) (“Witnesses may be inaccurate, contradictory, 
and even untruthful in some portions of their testimony, and yet 
be entirely credible in other portions of their testimony.”).
Thus, while the ICA erred in not finding the 
conversion from 30 mph to 44 feet per second proper for judicial 
notice, we hold that the error was harmless. 
2. The ICA Did Not Err in Declining to Take Judicial
Notice of the Annotated Map Attached to Kwong’s 
Opening Brief
Generally, “[t]here is no mandatory requirement for a
court of appeals to take judicial notice of any adjudicative 
fact, but, if it so chooses, such court may do so.”12  29 Am. 
Jur. 2d Evidence § 37 (2021); see also Reina-Rodriguez v. United 
States, 655 F.3d 1182, 1193 (9th Cir. 2011) (“[W]e rarely take 
12As noted above, there may be an exception with respect to court 
records in a related proceeding.  Oahu Publications, 134 Hawai‘ i at  20 n.3, 
332 P.3d at 163 n.3 (noting that the ICA may have been required to take 
judicial notice of court records involving the same parties).   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
26 judicial notice of facts presented for the first time on 
appeal[.]”).  However, appellate courts have discretion to take 
judicial notice in the interests of justice: “Where the equity 
of the situation dictates, we will use our discretion to take 
judicial notice of matters of which courts may properly take 
judicial notice but which are not part of the record on appeal.”
Eli v. State, 63 Haw. 474, 478, 630 P.2d 113, 116 (1981) (citing
McAulton v. Smart, 54 Haw. 488, 510 P.2d 93 (1973)) (taking 
judicial notice of court files); see also Gao v. State, Dep’t of
Attorney Gen., 137 Hawai ‘i 450, 459 n.6, 375 P.3d 229, 238 n.6 
(2016) (taking judicial notice of publicly available manual 
where appellant had been pro se until pro bono counsel was 
appointed).  
 
 
That said, even if an appellate court were inclined to 
take judicial notice, the facts to be noticed must be “commonly 
known or easily verifiable.”  Cf. In re Thomas H. Gentry 
Revocable Tr., 138 Hawai ‘i 158, 171 n.8, 378 P.3d 874, 887 n.8 
(2016) (taking judicial notice of a warranty deed which was “a 
matter of public record and easily verifiable”).  In Moses, for 
instance, this court declined to take juridical notice of the 
contents of letters between parties “because such communications 
differ from case to case” and are “subject to reasonable 
dispute.”  102 Hawai ‘i at 455, 77 P.3d at 946.  We reasoned that ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
27 taking judicial notice of such case-specific adjudicative facts 
in a criminal appeal was inappropriate because “[t]his court 
cannot consider evidence outside the record[.]”  Id.   
Here, the ICA correctly declined to take judicial 
notice of Kwong’s annotations on the map.  Like the letters in 
Moses, the annotations were case-specific, not information that 
is “commonly known or easily verifiable.”  Id.    
Moreover, Kwong’s annotations lacked foundation 
because they were never established to be a fair and accurate 
depiction of vehicles’ locations at the time Kwong changed 
lanes.  See HRE Rule 901(a) (requiring that evidence be 
authenticated “by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims”).  For 
example, Kwong’s annotations say that Officer Wong was in the 
middle-left lane, which was marked as 11 feet wide, and that 
Kwong drove from the right lane to the left lane, which was marked at 12 feet wide.  No testimony at trial established the 
widths of the relevant lanes; the map lacks a scale that could, 
under some circumstances, allow the figures to be ascertained; 
and Kwong has not shown where she obtained those measurements.    
Kwong argues that the State’s recitation of Officer 
Wong’s testimony was a “judicial admission under H.R.E. 
803(a)(1) that the vehicles [were] where Kwong placed them on ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
28 her Google aerial photograph[.]
”  We disagree.  Officer Wong 
testified that Kwong’s lane change took place within 30 feet of 
the intersection.  There is no way to verify, on the map Kwong 
drew, that the vehicles were within 30 feet from the 
intersection.  Similarly, Officer Wong testified that Kwong’s 
abrupt lane change happened as a pickup truck started to make a 
left turn.  Kwong drew the truck in the crosswalk, part-way 
through its left turn, but that may not have been accurate.  
Officer Wong did not state where the truck was located when Kwong changed lanes — the truck may have been in the left-turn 
lane still, or it may have been even farther into the 
intersection.   
Finally, “the equity of the situation” does not 
warrant taking judicial notice of the map.  Eli, 63 Haw. at 478, 
630 P.2d at 116.  Kwong was represented by counsel below; she could have introduced the map during trial and authenticated it as an accurate depiction of Kwong’s lane change.  Further, as 
previously discussed, the district court need not have credited 
Officer Wong’s estimate of the vehicles’ distances from the 
intersection to credit his other observations, including Kwong’s 
indicia of intoxication and her performance on the SFSTs.  
Accordingly, even if the ICA had taken judicial notice of the 
map and annotations, it would not have changed the outcome of ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
29 Kwong’s appeal.   
In sum, we hold that Kwong’s arguments that the 
district court and the ICA erred by refusing to take judicial 
notice are unavailing. 
B. 
The ICA Did Not Err in Declining to Question the District 
Court’s Credibility Determinations or in Affirming the District Court’s Denial of Kwong’s Motion for Judgment of Acquittal  
 
Kwong contends that the ICA “conflat[ed] the function 
of the trial court in determining the facts where there is 
conflicting evidence with the situation where there is no conflict in the evidence.”  Because Officer Wong testified to 
something that, according to Kwong, was “contrary to the laws of 
physics,” she seems to assert the ICA should have found him not 
credible.
13  We disagree.  
As the ICA recognized, during a bench trial, “[i]t is 
for the trial judge as fact-finder to assess the credibility of 
witnesses and to resolve all questions of facts; the judge may 
accept or reject any witness’s testimony in whole or in part.”  
State v. Monteil, 134 Hawai‘ i 361, 368, 341 P.3d 567, 574 (2014) 
(quoting Eastman, 81 Hawai‘ i at 139, 913 P.2d at 65).  Contrary 
                     
13   Kwong does not expressly say the ICA erred in declining to 
question the district court’s credibility determinations , but she implies it: 
“Officer Wong, who testified for the State uncontradicted to something that 
is scientifically impossible because his testimony is contrary to the laws of 
physics, is hardly a credible witness.”   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
30   /s/ Mark E. Recktenwald 
  /s/ Paula A. Nakayama 
  /s/ Sabrina S. McKenna 
  /s/ Michael D. Wilson   /s/ Bert I. Ayabe 
to Kwong’s assertion, even assuming Officer Wong’s testimony 
about the distances and speeds of her lane change was physically 
impossible, the court could have believed his remaining 
testimony about her performance on the SFSTs.  Cf. State v. Su, 
147 Hawai‘ i 272, 285, 465 P.3d 719, 732 (2020) (holding that 
testimony that does not make physical sense is not necessarily 
probative of untruthfulness).  Kwong herself admitted she had 
made a last-minute lane change into the far-left lane, 
corroborating that aspect of Officer Wong’s testimony.   
Thus, we hold that the ICA did not err in declining to 
question the district court’s credibility determinations or in determining that the motion for judgment of acquittal was 
properly denied.
