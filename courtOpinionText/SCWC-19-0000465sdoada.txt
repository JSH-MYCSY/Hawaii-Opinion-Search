 judgment of the District Court of the First Circuit.   The 
district court’s judgment granted Respondent/Defendant-Appellee 
Micah S.K. Vasconcellos’s Motion to Suppress Statements after 
finding that Vasconcellos was subject to custodial interrogation
without being given Miranda warnings.   1
 
Under our decision in State v. Sagapolutele-Silva, 151 
Hawai‘i 283, 511 P.3d 782 (2022), and for reasons set forth 
therein, Vasconcellos was not in custody at the time he was asked the medical rule-out questions because the circumstances 
of his stop did not rise to that of a formal arrest.  In holding 
otherwise, the ICA erred. 
II. BACKGROUND 
Vasconcellos was stopped by a Honolulu Police 
Department (HPD) officer for Reckless Driving after turning left 
from a straight-only lane and almost hitting a pedestrian.  
During the encounter, Vasconcellos acknowledged that he had seen 
the pedestrian but asserted that he had stopped for and/or 
swerved around the pedestrian.  The officer disagreed.  While 
speaking to Vasconcellos, the officer noticed indicia of intoxication and asked Vasconcellos to exit his vehicle and 
participate in a Standardized Field Sobriety Test (“SFST”); 
 
1  The Honorable Summer M.M. Kupau- Odo presided. 
  
 
   ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***__ 
3 
 Vasconcellos consented.  The officer then asked Vasconcellos the 
medical rule-out questions and Vasconcellos answered “no” to 
each.   
Vasconcellos was arrested and charged with Operating a 
Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII) in 
violation of Hawai‘ i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1) 
(Supp. 2018)2 and Reckless Driving in violation of HRS § 291-2 
(2007)3.  As relevant here, Vasconcellos moved to suppress his 
answers to the medical rule-out questions.4  The district court 
ruled that Vasconcellos was in custody at the time these 
 
2   HRS 291E- 61(a)(1) provides in relevant part:  
 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle 
under the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates 
or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle: 
(1) While under the influence of alcohol in an 
amount sufficient to impair the person’s normal mental faculties or ability to care for the person 
and guard against casualty[.] 
 
3   HRS § 291- 2 provides: “Whoever operates any vehicle . . . 
recklessly in disregard of the safety of persons or property is guilty of 
reckless driving of vehicle . . . and shall be fined not more than $1,000 or 
imprisoned not more than thirty days, or both.” 
 
4  Vasconcellos’s motion to suppress also sought to suppress all of 
his statements subsequent to the traffic stop.  The district court granted this motion in full.  On appeal, the ICA only affirmed the district court’s 
suppression of Vasconcellos’s answers to the medical rule- out questions while 
vacating the district court’s suppression of Vasconcellos’s other statements, 
including Vasconcellos’s statements after being told the reasons for the 
investigatory stop and being asked to participate in the field sobriety test, 
and Vasconcellos’s performance on the field sobriety test. 
      In its application for certiorari, the State challenges the 
district court’s suppression of Vasconcellos’s answers to the medical rule-out questions.  Vasconcellos did not file an application for certiorari.  
Accordingly, this order does not address the suppression of Vasconcellos’s 
other statements.  
    
 
   ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***__

 questions were asked, and the ICA affirmed that finding.  The 
ICA acknowledged that the test for determining whether a suspect 
is in custody requires consideration of the totality of the 
circumstances, but emphasized the existence of probable cause to 
arrest Vasconcellos for Reckless Driving.  State v. 
Vasconcellos, 147 Hawai‘ i 145, 464 P.3d 933, 2020 WL 3027399, at 
*4 (App. June 5, 2020) (SDO).  The ICA also held that the 
medical rule-out questions constituted interrogation.  Id. at 
*5. 
A. 
District Court Suppression Proceedings 
On May 28, 2019, the district court held a hearing on 
Vasconcellos’s motion to suppress.  After hearing testimony from 
the State’s sole witness, HPD Officer Ross Borges, the district 
court found that “there was custodial interrogation at the point 
of Officer Borges’s stop of Mr. Vasconcellos’s vehicle,” and 
entered a written order granting Vasconcellos’s motion to 
suppress.   
First, on the issue of custody, the court held that 
because Officer Borges saw Vasconcellos “almost killing a pedestrian . . . . there was definitely probable cause for a 
reckless driving arrest.”  Further, “once the vehicle was 
stopped and Officer Borges observed the defendant’s bloodshot 
eyes, slurred speech, and the odor of alcohol, he also had  
 
   ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***__ 
5 
 probable cause to arrest the defendant for OVUII.”  The district
court noted that Officer Borges “even testified that once he 
stopped the vehicle, Mr. Vasconcellos was not free to leave.”  
Accordingly, Vasconcellos was “definitely in custody for Miranda
purposes.”    
 
Second, the district court found that Vasconcellos was 
interrogated from the moment that he was pulled over.  The court 
suppressed all of Vasconcellos’s statements, including his response to why he was being stopped and whether he wished to 
participate in the SFST.
5   
The State appealed.  
B. ICA Proceedings 
The State raised one point of error to the ICA: “The 
district court erred in concluding that Vasconcellos was in 
custody as soon as Officer Borges stopped him or alternatively 
as soon as Officer Borges observed Vasconcellos’ indicia of 
intoxication and erred in suppressing all statements made by Vasconcellos and evidence of Vasconcellos’ performance on the 
SFST.”  The State did not specifically challenge the district    
 
5  In addition, the district court found that the SFST would not 
have been administered if Vasconcellos had not answered the medical rule- out 
questions, and therefore Vasconcellos’s performance on the SFST was fruit of 
the poisonous tree and should be suppressed.  The ICA vacated this holding, 
and it is not at issue here.  
 
   ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***__ 
6 
 court’s finding that the medical rule-out questions were 
interrogation.   
The ICA affirmed the district court in part, holding 
that Vasconcellos’s answers to the medical rule-out questions 
were properly suppressed.  Id. at *6.  However, the ICA vacated 
the district court’s order as to Vasconcellos’s other statements, including the results of the SFST, after finding 
they were not the product of custodial interrogation.  Id.   
The ICA held that when Vasconcellos told Officer 
Borges that he had seen the pedestrian and stopped and/or swerved around her — demonstrating he had seen her and was 
subjectively aware of the risk of hitting her — Officer Borges 
acquired probable cause to arrest Vasconcellos for Reckless 
Driving – even though there was not probable cause for an OUVII 
arrest.  Id.  Accordingly, the ICA agreed with the district 
court that Vasconcellos was in custody and “Miranda warnings 
were warranted prior to any interrogation.”  Id. at *5.   
The ICA also agreed with the district court that the 
medical rule-out questions amounted to interrogation. Id. 
(quoting State v. Sagapolutele-Silva, 147   92, 102, 464Hawai‘i
P.3d 880, 890 (App. 2020)).  Thus, the ICA affirmed the district court’s suppression of Vasconcellos’s responses to the medical 
rule-out questions because “Vasconcellos was subjected to a  
 
   ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***__ 
7 
 custodial interrogation without having first been given Miranda 
warnings.”  Id. at *6.   
The State filed a timely application for certiorari.  
C. Application for Writ of Certiorari 
The State raises the issues of custody and 
interrogation in its application for certiorari:  
1. Whether the ICA gravely erred in holding that 
Respond[e]nt- Defendant- Appellee, Micah Vasconcellos 
(Vasconcellos) was in custody as soon as Honolulu Police Department (HPD) Officer Ross Borges pulled him over. 
 
2. Whether the ICA gravely erred in holding that the 
medical rule- out questions asked as part of the Standard 
Field Sobriety Test (SFST) are interrogation. 
 
 
3. Whether the ICA gravely erred in suppressing Vasconcellos’ answers to the medical rule- out questions.  
 
  Vasconcellos did not file a response. 
 
III. DISCUSSION 
In our recent decision in Sagapolutele-Silva, we held 
that whether or not a defendant is “in custody” requires 
“objectively appraising the totality of the circumstances.”  151 
  at 299, 511 P.3d at 798 (citing State v. Melemai, 64 Haw. Hawai‘i
479, 481, 643 P.2d, 541, 544 (1982)).  There, we explained that 
the court looks for “any . . . event[s] or condition[s] that 
betoken[] a significant deprivation of freedom, ‘such that an 
innocent person could reasonably have believed that he or she 
was not free to go and that he or she was being taken into  
 
   ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***__ 
8 
 custody indefinitely.’”  Id. (alterations in original) (citing 
State v. Ketchum, 97   
(2001)). 107, 125, 34 P.3d 1006, 1024Hawai‘i
A temporary investigative detention such as a traffic 
stop is assessed under a totality of the circumstances analysis.  
See Sagapolutele-Silva, 151 Hawai‘ i at 299, 511 P.3d at 798  
(citing State v. Ah Loo, 94 Hawai‘ i 207, 211, 10 P.3d 728, 732 
(2000)).  In considering whether a temporary detention has 
“morphed into an arrest,” this court looks for factors 
traditionally associated with arrest, such as “handcuffing, 
leading the detainee to a different location, subjecting him or 
her to booking procedures, ordering his or her compliance with 
an officer’s directives, using force, or displaying a show of 
authority beyond that inherent in the mere presence of a police officer.”  Id. at 299, 511 P.3d at 798 (quoting Ketchum, 97 
Hawai‘i at 125, 34 P.3d at 1024).   Relevant factors include: 
“the time, place and length of the interrogation, the nature of 
the questions asked, and the conduct of the police at the time 
of the interrogation,” id. at 299, 511 P.3d at 798 (quoting 
State v. Paahana, 66 Haw. 499, 503, 666 P.2d 592, 595 (1983)), 
as well as “whether the investigation has focused on the suspect 
and whether the police have probable cause to arrest him prior 
to questioning.”  Melemai, 64 Haw. at 481, 643 P.2d at 544.    
 
   ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***__ 
9 
 Here, the totality of the circumstances show that 
Vasconcellos was not in custody.  Although the district court 
acknowledged Officer Borges’s testimony that Vasconcellos “was 
not free to leave,” the district court made no finding that 
Vasconcellos’s freedom of movement had been curtailed to a 
“degree associated with formal arrest.”  Berkemer v. McCarty, 
468 U.S. 420, 440 (1984).  Indeed, the record did not establish that his freedom had been limited to that extent.  Vasconcellos was not told he was being arrested; he was not handcuffed or 
taken to the police station; there were, at most, two officers 
present during the traffic stop; and Officer Borges did not use 
physical force or display “a show of authority beyond that 
inherent in the mere presence of a police officer.”  Ketchum, 97 
Hawai‘i at 125, 34 P.3d at 1024; see State v. Patterson, 59 Haw. 
357, 363-64, 581 P.2d 752, 756 (1978) (finding no custody where, 
inter alia, “[n]o guns were drawn and kept upon the defendant”).  
Although Officer Borges asked Vasconcellos to step out of his car and over to the sidewalk, that alone is insufficient to turn 
the traffic stop into a custodial arrest.  See Kernan v. Tanaka, 
75 Haw. 1, 38, 856 P.2d 1207, 1226 (1993) (“Ordering the driver 
to exit the vehicle is an extension of the [temporary 
investigative] seizure that must be accompanied by sufficient 
facts to support the officer’s action.”).

 Thus, under a totality of the circumstances analysis, 
Vasconcellos was not in custody at the time Officer Borges asked 
the medical rule-out questions, and Miranda warnings were not 
required.6   
IV. CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, the ICA erred in affirming 
the district court’s suppression of Vasconcellos’s responses to 
the medical rule-out questions.  The ICA’s July 2, 2020 judgment on appeal and the district court’s May 28, 2019 judgment are 
vacated as to the suppression of those responses.  In all other 
respects, the judgment of the ICA is affirmed.  This case is 
remanded to the district court for further proceedings 
consistent with this order.

6  Given that Vasconcellos was not in custody, we need not reach the 
question of interrogation to conclude that Miranda warnings were not 
required.
