 the District Court of the First Circuit.   
The district court’s 
judgment granted Respondent/Defendant-Appellee Jeramy M. 
Tronson’s Motion to Suppress Statements after finding that 
Tronson was subject to custodial interrogation without being given Miranda warnings. 1
We hold that under our decision in State v. 
Sagapolutele-Silva, 151 Hawai‘ i 283, 511 P.3d 782 (2022), Tronson 
was not in custody at the time he was asked the medical rule-out questions as the record does not support the conclusion that the 
circumstances of his stop rose to that of a formal arrest.  The 
ICA erred to the extent it held otherwise. 
II. BACKGROUND 
Tronson was pulled over at around 3:30 a.m. by a 
Honolulu Police Department (HPD) officer after almost hitting the officer’s car.  After being informed why he was stopped, Tronson apologized to the officer for almost hitting his car.  
The officer noticed that Tronson’s eyes were red and glassy, his 
speech was slurred, and his breath smelled like alcohol.  The 
officer asked Tronson if he was willing to participate in a 
Standardized Field Sobriety Test (SFST), and Tronson agreed.  
Prior to administering the test, the officer asked, and Tronson 
answered in the negative, the medical rule-out questions.

 Tronson was arrested and charged with Operating a 
Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII) in 
violation of 
Hawai i ‘ Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1) 
(Supp. 2018)2 and Reckless Driving in violation of HRS § 291-2 
(2007).3  As relevant here, Tronson moved to suppress his answers 
to the medical rule-out questions.4  The district court ruled 
that Tronson was in custody at the time these questions were 
asked, and the ICA affirmed that finding.  The ICA acknowledged 
that the test for determining whether a suspect is in custody 
requires consideration of the totality of the circumstances, but 
emphasized the existence of probable cause to arrest Tronson for 
 
2  HRS § 291E- 61(a)(1) provides in relevant part:  
 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle 
under the influence of an intoxicant if the person 
operates or assumes actual physical control of a 
vehicle: 
(1) While under the influence of alcohol in 
an amount sufficient to impair the person’s normal mental faculties or ability to care for 
the person and guard against casualty[.] 
 
3  HRS § 291- 2 provides: “Whoever operates any vehicle . . . 
recklessly in disregard of the safety of persons or property is guilty of 
reckless driving of vehicle . . . and shall be fined not more than $1,000 or 
imprisoned not more than thirty days, or both.” 
 
4  Tronson’s motion to suppress also sought to suppress all of his 
statements subsequent to the traffic stop.  The district court granted this 
motion in full.  On appeal, the ICA affirmed the district court’s suppression 
of Tronson’s answers to the medical rule- out questions, while vacating the 
court’s suppression of Tronson’s answers to whether he would participate in the SFST and understood the SFST instructions as well as the results of the 
SFST.  Because the State’s application for writ of certiorari only contests the ICA’s decision as to the medical rule- out questions, and because Tronson 
did not file an application for writ of certiorari, the latter determinations are not at issue in this order.

 Reckless Driving.  State v. Tronson, 147 Hawai‘ i 628, 465 P.3d 
1075, 2020 WL 3542147, at *4-5 (App. June 30, 2020) (mem. op.). 
The ICA also held that the medical rule-out questions 
constituted interrogation.  Id. at *7.   
A. District Court Suppression Proceedings 
 
The district court held a hearing on Tronson’s motion 
to suppress on May 9, 2019.  After hearing testimony from the State’s sole witness, HPD Officer Tyler Maalo, the district 
court found that Tronson “was in custody for Miranda purposes at 
the time of the stop . . . because . . . clearly the officer had 
probable cause to arrest [] Tronson even before he approached 
the vehicle based on his observations of defendant’s driving.”  
The district court granted Tronson’s motion to suppress.  Its 
written conclusions of law (COLs) state in relevant part as 
follows: 
5.  To determine whether “interrogation” is “custodial,” [the 
court] look[s] to the totality of the circumstances, focusing on 
‘the place and time of the interrogation, the length of the 
interrogation, the nature of the questions asked, the conduct of 
the police, and [any] other relevant circumstances.’ ”  [State v. 
]Ketchum, [97 Hawaiʻ i 107,] 122[, 34 P.3d 1006, 1021 (2001) 
(citations omitted).]  Among the “other relevant circumstances” 
to be considered are whether the investigation has focused on the suspect and whether the police have probable cause to arrest the suspect.  (First, second, and third alterations in original). 
 
6.  At the time when Officer Maalo first approached 
Defendant while he was seated in his vehicle, there existed probable cause to arrest Defendant for the offense of Reckless Driving; and Defendant was not free to leave.  
Accordingly, at this time, Defendant was “in custody” for 
Miranda purposes. 
 
The State appealed.

 B.
 ICA Proceedings 
 
  On appeal, the State challenged the district court’s 
conclusion that Tronson was subject to custodial interrogation.  
In essence, the State claimed that “Miranda warnings were not 
required, because Tronson was not in custody or interrogated before the SFST had been administered and [he] was arrested for 
OVUII.”   
  In a memorandum opinion, the ICA agreed with the 
district court that Tronson was in custody and subject to 
interrogation when asked the medical rule-out questions.  Citing 
State v. Ah Loo, 94 Hawaiʻ i 207, 211, 10 P.3d 728, 732 (2000), 
the ICA acknowledged that Tronson was not in custody simply 
because he was seized.  Tronson, 2020 WL 3542147, at *4.  But 
the ICA still concluded that Tronson was in custody, based primarily on the existence of probable cause to arrest for 
Reckless Driving: 
As we further noted in Sagapolutele- Silva, there is 
no requirement for the police to arrest a suspect once 
probable cause is established.  Sagapolutele- Silva, 2020 WL 
1699907 at *6 (citation omitted).  The police need not halt an investigation the moment they have the minimum evidence 
to establish probable cause because it may fall short of evidence necessary to support a criminal conviction.  Id.  
Nevertheless, “[a]n individual in police custody may not be subjected to interrogation without first being advised of 
his Miranda rights.”  Id.  (citation and internal quotation 
marks omitted). 
 Under the totality of the circumstances in this case, 
Tronson was in custody for Reckless Driving.  Officer Maalo had probable cause to arrest him for Reckless Driving when 
he stopped him.  In addition, as discussed below, upon his initial conversation with Tronson, Officer Maalo had a 
reasonable suspicion that he was driving while intoxicated.     ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***__

 Officer Maalo testified that Tronson was not free to leave 
from the time he was stopped.  Under the totality of the 
circumstances, the District Court did not err in COL 6 in 
concluding that Tronson was in custody and that Tronson 
should have been given Miranda warnings prior to any 
interrogation.  
 
Id. at *5. 
  Finally, the ICA held that the medical rule-out 
questions were interrogation.  Accordingly, the ICA affirmed the 
district court’s suppression of Tronson’s responses to the 
medical rule-out questions.   
     The State filed a timely application for writ of 
certiorari. C. Application for Writ of Certiorari 
  The State raises three questions in its application: 
1. Whether the ICA gravely erred in holding that 
Responde nt-Defendant- Appellee, Jeramy M. Tronson (Tronson) 
was in custody as soon as Honolulu Police Department (HPD) 
Officer Tyler Maalo pulled him over. 
 
2. Whether the ICA gravely erred in holding that the 
medical rule- out questions asked as part of the Standard 
Field Sobriety Test (SFST) are interrogation. 
 
3. Whether the ICA gravely erred in suppressing 
Tronson’s answers to the medical rule- out questions.  
 
  Tronson did not file a response.   
III. DISCUSSION 
As we recently held in Sagapolutele-Silva, 151 Hawai‘ i 
at 287, 511 P.3d at 786, the test to determine whether a person 
is in custody is one of the totality of the circumstances, 
objectively appraised from the perspective of a reasonable 
person in the suspect’s position.      ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***__

 Applied here, Tronson was not in custody.  The 
circumstances of Tronson’s detention amounted to no more than a 
routine traffic stop, not the functional equivalent of a formal 
arrest.  Tronson was stopped briefly in public.  Although Officer Maalo believed he had probable cause to arrest Tronson 
for Reckless Driving, Officer Maalo did not tell Tronson that he 
was not free to go or otherwise restrain him from leaving.  As 
we explained in Sagapolutele-Silva, 151 
Hawai‘i at 296, 511 P.3d 
at 795, “[w]hile ‘[a]n officer’s knowledge or beliefs may bear 
upon the custody issue if they are conveyed, by word or deed, to 
the individual being questioned,’ they ‘are relevant only to the 
extent they would affect how a reasonable person in the position 
of the individual being questioned would gauge the breadth of 
his or her “freedom of action.”’” (quoting Stansbury v. 
California, 511 U.S. 318, 325 (1994)) (second alteration in 
original).  Officer Maalo informed Tronson why he stopped him, and Tronson apologized to Officer Maalo for almost hitting his 
car, but there is nothing to indicate that Tronson understood 
that he had implicated himself in a crime that could lead to his 
arrest.  The point of arrest had not arrived, and Miranda 
warnings were not required.5    
 
5  Because Tronson was not in custody at the time the medical rule-
out questions were asked, we need not reach the issue of interrogation; 
Miranda warnings were not required.      ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***__

 Accordingly, we hold that the ICA erred in affirming 
the district court’s suppression of Tronson’s answers to the 
medical rule-out questions. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, the ICA erred in affirming 
the district court’s suppression of Tronson’s responses to the 
medical rule-out questions.  The ICA’s July 31, 2020 judgment on 
appeal and the district court’s May 9, 2019 judgment are vacated 
as to the suppression of those responses.   
In all other respects, the judgment of the ICA is 
affirmed.  This case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this order.
