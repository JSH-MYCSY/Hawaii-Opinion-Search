 I. INTRODUCTIO
N 
This case is brought by  Association of Apartment 
Owners of Elima Lani Condominiums (AOAO) , the same condominium 
association that brought suit in Nationstar Mortgage, LLC v. 
AOAO, No. SCWC-18-0000475, 2023 WL 2519855  (Haw. Mar. 15, 2023) .  
The facts of this case are similar to Nationstar , and as set 
forth below, we reach the same result here.  
II. BACKGROUND  
  After recording a notice of default and intention to 
foreclose on the property’s owner  for unpaid assessments and 
costs, AOAO acquired the property by quitclaim deed filed  
July 27, 2015 after a non -judicial foreclosure sale.  On 
September 27, 2017, MTGLQ Investors, L.P.  (MTGLQ) filed a 
complaint in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit for 
foreclosure of the property.  In response,  AOAO denied that its 
interest was junior to MTGLQ’s and alleged that the original 
property owner  owed it $35,079. 61 in delinquent assessments as 
of July 27, 2015.   
  On October 29, 2018, MTGLQ moved for summary judgment 
and an interlocutory decree of foreclosure.  It asked that a 
commissioner be appointed to take possession of the property, 
rent it out, and sell it.   AOAO objected to MTGLQ’s request for 
possession and rents.  It argued that Hawai͑i Revised Statutes ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
3 
  (HRS) § 514B-146(n) (Supp. 2015) referenced “any excess rental 
income received by the association” after a bank foreclosure, 
which meant the statute “clea rly contemplated and accepted” that 
the association would continue in possession and collect rents.2  
On June 17, 2019 , the court granted summary judgment  in favor of 
MTGLQ and an interlocutory decree of foreclosure , and appointed 
                     
2  HRS § 514B -146(n) was numbered as HRS § 514B -146(k) before the 
statute was renumbered in 2018, and it is referred to as HRS § 514B -146(k) in 
the briefing .  See 2018 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 195, § 4 at 672.  Because there 
was no change to the substance of the statute, we refer to the current 
numbering, HRS § 514B -146(n), throughout.  See id.  HRS § 514B -146(n) 
provides:  
 
After any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure 
proceeding in which the a ssociation acquires title to the 
unit, any excess rental income received by the association 
from the unit shall be paid to existing lien holders based 
on the priority of lien,  and not on a pro rata basis, and 
shall be applied to the benefit of the unit own er.  For 
purposes of this subsection, excess rental income shall be 
any net income received by the association after a court 
has issued a final judgment determining the priority of a 
senior mortgagee and after paying, crediting, or 
reimbursing the associat ion or a third party for:  
(1) The lien for delinquent assessments pursuant to 
subsections (a) and (b);  
(2) Any maintenance fee delinquency against the 
unit; 
(3) Attorney ’s fees and other collection costs 
related to the association ’s foreclosure of the 
unit; or  
(4) Any costs incurred by the association for the 
rental, repair, maintenance, or rehabilitation 
of the unit while the association is in 
possession of the unit including monthly 
association maintenance fees, management fees, 
real estate commissions, cleaning and r epair 
expenses for the unit, and general excise taxes 
paid on rental income;  
provided that the lien for delinquent assessments  under 
paragraph (1) shall be paid, credited, or reimbursed first.  ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
3 a commissioner to take possession and collect rents.   AOAO filed 
a timely notice of appeal.  
4 
  
 In a report dated January 21, 2020, the Commissioner 
stated that he had conducted a public auction of the property 
and recommended the court confirm the sale.  He attested that he 
had collected $3,275.00 in total rents for the months of August, 
September, and October 2019, and that the tenant had vacated on 
November 1.  The court confirmed the sale and awarded the rent 
to MTGLQ on June 12, 2020
.  AOAO filed another timely notice of 
appeal from this judgment.  
The ICA consolidated both of AOAO’s appeals for 
disposition, and affirmed both the interlocutory decree of 
foreclosure and the judgment confirming the sale.  It found that 
the circuit 
court’s order that the Commissioner should p ossess, 
rent, and sell the property was not in error because AOAO’s 
rights in the property were foreclosed by the foreclosure 
judgment.  The ICA then rejected AOAO’s interpretation of HRS    
§ 514B-146(n), quoting its holding in Bank of N.Y. Mellon v. 
Larrua that the statute addresses “how an AOAO must utilize any 
rental income it receives” but it “does not, however, necessarily 
entitle an AOAO to receive such rental income” following a

 mortgagee’s 
foreclosure.  150 Hawai ‘i 429, 443—44, 504 P.3d 1017, 
1031—32 (App. 2022). 
III. DISCUSSION  
This case raises the same two questions  of law as  
Nationstar : (1) whether, under our precedents, a foreclosed 
owner (in this case, the association) is entitled to exclusive 
possession and rents after the entry of summary judgment and an 
interlocutory decree of foreclosure, but prior to the 
confirmation of sale; and (2) if not, whether HRS § 514B -146(n) 
entitles the association to rents accruing during  this period,  
or some portion of them.   Nationstar , 2023 WL 2519855 , at *5.     
With respect to the first question,  we hold here, as 
in Nationstar , that AOAO’s right to rents and possession was 
terminated by the foreclosure judgment.  See id.  Unless 
provided otherwise by statute, AOAO was not entitled to rent or 
possession after the circuit court entered summary judgment in 
favor of MTGLQ.  Id.  In Nationstar , we affirmed the following 
holding of the ICA, which was based on Larrua:  
  [U]nder Hawai‘i law, it is well -established that a 
judgment entered on a foreclosure decree is a final 
determination of the parties’ rights in the subject 
property – in other words, the property owners’ rights in 
the property are foreclosed, notwithstanding that further 
proceedings are necessary to enforce and otherwise 
effectuate the foreclosure decree and judgment.  
 
Id. at *6 (alteration in original) (quoting Larrua, 150 Hawai‘i 
at 439, 504 P.3d at 1027).   ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 We further explained that proceedings that follow the 
judgment, such as confirmation-of-sale proceedings, “are treated 
as incidental to enforcement of the foreclosure judgment.”   Id. 
(quoting Mortg. Elec. Registration Sys., Inc. v. Wise, 130 
Hawai‘i 11, 19, 3
04 P.3d 1192, 1200 (2013)).  And, as an 
equitable remedy designed to preserve the status quo and protect 
a lender’s collateral, “ Hawai‘i courts may authorize a 
commissioner to take possession and collect rents where the 
collateral is inadequate to satisfy a mortgagee.”   Id.  In sum, 
the appointment of a commissioner cuts off the prior owner’s 
possession, and AOAO was not entitled to continue possession and 
collection of rents after the Commissioner’s appointment.  See 
id. at *6—7 . 
With respect to the second question, we interpret HRS 
§ 514B-146(n) to apply to rental income received by the 
association after a mortgagee’s subsequent foreclosure, whether 
or not a commissioner is appointed.  
 Id. at *8.  The statute 
entitles the association to such income, however collected, but 
only to the extent it does not exceed the sum of the amounts 
listed in subsections (1) through (4).  Id.  As we held in 
Nationstar:  
  [I]n enacting HRS § 514B -146(n), the legislature 
intended for a foreclosing association to be able to 
collect what it was due and no more; hence, the association 
is to receive all rents short of “excess rental income.”  
Accordingly, the statute calls for an accounting to take ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
7 
 place upon confirmation.  The association must account for 
all rents from the time it foreclosed on the property .  If 
this amount exceeds the sum of the assessment and 
maintenance delinquencies, the costs of foreclosure, and 
the maintenance fees that accrued while the association was 
in possession, the AOAO is not entitled to retain rents 
accruing after the foreclos ure.  However, if it still faces 
a shortfall even after the rent it collected, it may 
continue to collect rent short of “excess rental income.”  
When a commissioner is in possession, the commissioner  
collects and holds the rent on behalf of the court, whic h 
will ultimately be distributed upon confirmation of the 
sale according to HRS § 514B -146(n).  
 
Id. at *9 (citation omitted) .  
 
Here, the Commissioner collected $3,275.00 in rent for 
August, September, and October 2019.  Under Nationstar, AOAO may 
be entitled to all or some of the rent collected by the 
Commissioner after summary judgment, provided that it has not 
already recouped its losses through the rent previously 
collected .  Id. at *8— 9.  We accordingly remand for the circuit 
court to allocate these rents according to HRS § 514B -146(n)(1) -
(4) and our holding in Nationstar .   
IV. CONCLUSION  
For the foregoing reasons, the circuit court’s     
June 26, 2020 Order Confirming Foreclosure Sale, Approving 
Commissioner’s Report, Allowance of Commissioner’s Fees, 
Attorney’s Fees, Costs , Directing Conveyance and for Writ of 
Ejectment and the ICA’s June 3, 2022  Judgment on Appeal are 
vacated with regard to the allocation of rents collected by the 
Commissioner.  This case is remanded to the circuit court for ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 further proceedings specifically to determine what portion of 
the rents collected by the 
Commissioner after the circuit 
court’s June 17, 2019 Amended Findings of Fact, Conclusions of 
Law and Order Granting Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment 
Against AOAO constituted excess rental income pursuant to HRS  
§ 514B-146(n).  Per that statute, AOAO is entitled to receive 
any portion of those rents that do not constitute excess rental
income.
