Petitioner/Plaintiff-Appellee,  
 
vs.  
 
JACK PURDY; REGAL CAPITAL CORPORATION;  
REGAL CAPITAL COMPANY, LLC,  
Respondents/Defendants-Appellants.  
CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS  
(CAAP-19-0000538; CASE NO.  5CC041000003)  
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION  
(By:  Recktenwald,   C.J.,  McKenna,   Eddins,  Ginoza,  and  Devens,  JJ.)  
 
Currently before us is a second appeal in this case. 
In 2011, Petitioner/Plaintiff-Appellee Elesther Calipjo  
(Calipjo) brought suit against Respondents/Defendants-Appellants 
Jack Purdy (Purdy), Regal Capital Corporation ( Regal Corp. ), and 
Regal Capital Company, LLC (Regal LLC )  (collectively, 
Respondents) asserting claims related to agreements to purchase 
two properties located on Kaua ‘i.  After a jury trial, the 
Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit  (Circuit Court) entered final 1

 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
judgment on July 18, 2014  (Final Judgment ).   With regard to  
Count 10  of Calipjo’s First Amended Complaint, which asserted a 
claim for unfair and deceptive acts or practices ( UDAP), 
judgment was entered in favor of Calipjo as follows: (a) 
$166,865  against Purdy, (b) $166,875 against Regal Corp., and 
(c) $7,500 against Regal LLC, plus statutory interest. The 
Final Judgment  also provided that Purdy was jointly and 
severally liable for the  monetary  judgments entered against  both  
Regal Corp. and Regal LLC.   2
The instant appeal addresses the effect of this 
court’s prior decision  in  Calipjo v. Purdy, 144 Hawai‘i 266, 439 
P.3d 218 (2019) (Calipjo I )  on the judgment against Purdy for 
the UDAP claim.   Specifically, the question we address is 
whether Calipjo I, which reinstated the Circuit Court’s Final 
Judgment, intended to only reinstate the judgment against Purdy 
to the extent he is liable jointly and severally for the 
judgments entered against Regal Corp. and Regal LLC, or whether 
Purdy is also liable for the judgment against him individually 
on  the UDAP claim.   The Intermediate Court of Appeals  (ICA)  held  
that,  under Calipjo I, alter ego liability made Purdy  liable for 
2 Given the special verdict amount of $55,625 against Purdy for the 
UDAP claim , it appears this amount for treble damages should have been 
$166,875.

     *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the obligations of Regal Corp. and Regal LLC, but that Purdy was 
not liable for the independent UDAP judgment against him. 
We conclude, given th is court’s opinion and judgment 
on appeal entered in Calipjo I , the Circuit Court’s July 18, 
2014 Final Judgment was reinstated in its entirety. 
Accordingly, Purdy is liable to the full extent under the Final 
Judgment, including the judgment against him individually on the 
UDAP claim . We reverse the ICA’s judgment on appeal entered in 
this second appeal to the extent the ICA determined that Purdy 
was entitled to require Calipjo to disgorge funds previously 
paid to Calipjo . 
I. Background 
The fact s of this case are detailed in Calipjo I . 144 
Hawai ‘i at 268-70, 439 P.3d at 220-22. Relevant facts for the 
UDAP claim are summarized here. 
In August 2002, when Purdy was Regal Corp.’s sole 
owner and operator, Regal Corp. entered into two separate 
contracts with Calipjo for the sale of a unit at the Moana Ranch 
Estates ( Moana property ) and a unit at the Ali‘i Ranch Estates 
(Ali‘i property ). Calipjo’s purchase of the Moana property was 
contingent on his purchase of the Ali‘i property . The contract 
on the Ali‘i property gave Calipjo the option to purchase once a 
Final Condominium Public Report (FCPR) was issued. When Calipjo 
initially signed it, t he Ali‘i property contract also gave him, 
3  
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
  
  
 
 
   
  
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
but not Regal Corp. , the option to terminate within a specified 
time period. 
After Regal Corp.’s real estate agent, Tom Summers 
(Summers), provided Purdy with copies of the contracts, Purdy 
instructed Summers to add the phrase “or Seller” to the 
condition that allowed termination of the Ali‘i property 
contract. Given that the purchase of the Moana property was 
contingent on the purchase of the Ali‘i property, this change 
would give Regal Corp. the right to terminate both contracts. 
After being instructed to make the change by Purdy, Summer s met 
with Calipjo to have Calipjo initial and backdate the amended 
language. According to Calipjo, Summers told him the amendment 
would not change his position and it was “a mere technicality 
with the CPR laws that they’re doing.” Summers testified that 
he told Calipjo the amendment was Purdy’s counteroffer and if 
Calipjo did not want to acknowledge it , he would not have a 
reservation agreement. Calipjo asserted he relied on Summer s’s 
representation, had no prior experience with C PRs, and initialed 
the change to the Ali‘i property contract . 
While waiting for issuance of the FCPR, Calipjo found 
interested buyers for the properties and entered contracts to 
subsequently re sell the units. In turn, Purdy realized he could 
do something better with the propert ies. Eventually, Regal 
Corp. transferred its interest in the two properties to Regal

 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
LLC for no consideration. Purdy was the sole member and manager 
of Regal LLC. 
In August 2003 , Calipjo received a letter from Purdy 
stating that Regal Corp. was exercising its right to cancel the 
Ali‘i property contract , which also effectively prevented the 
sale of the Moana property. Calipjo refused to cancel the 
escrow and returned refund checks that Regal Corp. had sent to 
him. 
Calipjo testified tha t, years after Purdy canceled the 
contracts, Purdy approached Calipjo outside of the Kaua ʻi 
courthouse and said he had never intended to sell the properties 
to Calipjo. 
A. Jury Trial 
The case was tried before a jury which rendered its 
decision in a Special Verdict Form . On the UDAP claim, the 
jury’s Special Verdict Form specifie d that the jury found that 
Purdy, Regal Corp . and Regal LLC each “engaged in an act or 
practice that was unfair or deceptive” and assessed damages 
incurred by Calipjo due to each defendant as follows: Purdy 
($55,625), Regal Corp. ($55,625), and Regal LLC ($2,500).3 
3 The jury also found Purdy and Regal Corp. liable for breach of 
contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, with 
regard to both contracts, and awarded nominal damages for these claims.

  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The jury also found that Purdy was the alter ego of 
both Regal Corp. and Regal LLC. 
The Circuit Court thereafter entered the July 18, 2014 
Final Judgment. On the UDAP claim , judgment was entered against 
Purdy, Regal Corp., and Regal LLC for treble damages. 
B. First Appeal to ICA 
In the first appeal to the ICA, Respondents argued 
inter alia  that the Circuit Court erred by denying motions for 
judgment as a matter of law and for directed verdict. In its 
Summary Disposition Order ( SDO),  the ICA  held  in relevant part 
that: there was no evidence to support the jury’s verdict that Purdy was the alter ego of either Regal Corp. or Regal LLC; 
there was sufficient evidence to support the jury verdict of 
UDAP against Regal Corp., but not Regal LLC; and as to the UDAP 
claim against Purdy, Calipjo’s reliance on  
Hawaiʻi Revised 
Statutes  (HRS)  §  480-17(a)  (2008)  was misplaced. Calipjo v. 
Purdy, No. CAAP-14-0001305, 2017 WL 6547461,  at *3-6  (Haw. App. 
Dec. 22, 2017) (SDO) ( 2017  ICA  SDO).  4
4 HRS § 480 -17(a), governing individual liability for a corporate or 
company act, provides, “ [w]henever a corporation violates any of the penal 
provisions of this chapter, the violation shall be deemed to be also that of 
the individual directors, officers, or agents of the corporation who have 
authorized, ordered, or done any of the acts constituting in whole or in part 
the violation.”

     *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
For the UDAP claim, the ICA reversed the treble 
damages of $166,865 entered against Purdy and the treble damages 
of $7,500 entered against Regal LLC . The ICA affirmed the 
treble damages of $166,875 entered against Regal Corp. Id. at 
*7. The ICA also reversed the jury’s finding that Purdy is the 
alter ego of Regal Corp. and Regal LLC. Id. 
C. First Appeal to Supreme Court 
Calipjo filed an application for writ of certiorari 
requesting review of the 2017 ICA SDO.   Among his arguments, 
Calipjo asserted  that the ICA  erred  by: reversing the jury’s 
finding that Purdy is the alter ego of Regal Corp. and Regal 
LLC; and reversing the judgment against Purdy and Regal LLC for 
UDAP. Calipjo argued that the ICA’s reversal of the UDAP 
judgment against Purdy was premised on its reversal of the jury 
finding that Purdy is the alter ego of Regal Corp. and Regal 
LLC.  Calipjo also pointed to evidence showing that Respondents 
never intended to sell the properties to Calipjo, including testimony by Summers and evidence about Purdy’s direct statement 
to Calipjo in 2009, that he never intended to sell.   Calipjo 
argued that the actions of Purdy violated HRS §  480-2 (2008)
  and 
that the jury found all of the Respondents liable for UDAP.  5

 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
In Calipjo I , the opinion summarizes its holding up 
front, stating: 
We hold that there was evidence to support the jury ’s 
verdict that Regal Corp. violated the terms of the 
agreements, Regal LLC engaged in unfair and deceptive acts or practices, and Purdy was the alter ego of Regal Corp. 
and Regal LLC.  Therefore, the Intermediate Court of 
Appeals (“ICA”) erred when it found that no evidence was 
introduced at trial to support these findings. 
Additionally, the ICA erred when it reversed the circuit court’s final judgment against Purdy  on the  breach of 
contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and unfair and deceptive acts or practices 
claims.   We affirm in part and vacate in part the ICA ’s 
January 24, 2018 Judgment on Appeal and reinstate the 
circuit court ’s July 18, 2014 final judgment .  
144 Hawai‘i at 268, 439 P.3d at 220 (emphases added) (citation 
and footnote omitted). 
Within the context of addressing the jury’s finding 
that Purdy was the alter ego of Regal Corp. and Regal LLC, the 
(a) Unfair methods of competition and unfair or 
deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or 
commerce are unlawful. 
(b) In construing this section, the courts and the 
office of consumer protection shall give due consideration to 
the rules, regulations, and decisions of the Federal Trade 
Commission and the federal courts interpreting section 
5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 
45(a)(1)), as from time to time amended. 
(c) No showing that the proceeding or suit would be in 
the public interest (as these terms are interpreted under 
section 5(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act) is necessary 
in any action brought under this section. 
(d) No person other than a consumer, the attorney 
general or the director of the office of consumer protection 
may bring an action based upon unfair or deceptive acts or 
practices declared unlawful by this section. 
(e) Any person may bring an action based on unfair 
methods of competition declared unlawful by this section.

opinion also detailed Purdy’s individual misconduct ,  and that 
there was evidence that “Purdy used Regal Corp. and Regal LLC to 
commit a fraud because he never intended to sell the properties 
to Calipjo.” Id.  at 280,  439 P.3d at 232.  The opinion states  
that “[b]ecause the jury found that Purdy was the alter ego of Regal Corp. and Regal LLC, Purdy was held liable for the 
underlying claims.”   Id.  at 282, 439 P.3d at 234.   The opinion 
also notes, however, that “[o]n the special verdict form, with 
respect to the 
Aliʻi and Moana property [Deposit Receipt Offer 
and Acceptances], the jury determined that Purdy  breached his 
contractual obligations, failed to act with good faith and fair 
dealing, and committed unfair and deceptive acts or practices.”   
Id.  at 282 n.28, 439 P.3d at 234 n.28 (emphases added).   The 
opinion concludes  by stating  that we  “vacate in part[]  the 
January 24, 2018 judgment of the ICA and reinstate the circuit 
court’s July 18, 2014 final judgment.”   Id.  at 282, 439 P.3d at 
234 (emphasis added). No motion for reconsideration or clarification was filed.    6
6 Calipjo I affirmed the ICA’s judgment in part, explaining : 
The ICA also affirmed the judgment against Regal Corp. for 
breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, 
unfair and deceptive acts or practices, and treble damages 
totaling $ 166,875.00  arising from the unfair and deceptive 
acts or practices claim. Calipjo, 2017 WL 6547461, at *7, 
408 P.3d 885 . Because these issues are not raised in the 
application to this court, we affirm the ICA ’s judgment in 
part.

 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
This court’s Judgment on Appeal in Calipjo I states 
that “the January 24, 2018 judgment of the Intermediate Court of 
Appeals is affirmed in part and vacated in part, and the July 
18, 2014 final judgment of the Circuit Court of the Fifth 
Circuit is reinstated.”   (Emphasis added.)   Neither the opinion 
nor the Judgment on Appeal in Calipjo I  remanded the case to the 
Circuit Court.  
D. Motion to Enforce 
After Calipjo I , Respondents filed a motion in Circuit 
Court seeking to “enforce” Calipjo I , asserting that Purdy was 
entitled to require Calipjo to disgorge funds Purdy had paid to 
satisfy the judgment entered against him individually on the 
UDAP claim ($166,865), plus related attorneys’ fees and interest 
he had also paid ( Motion to Enforce ). At the hearing on the 
Motion to Enforce, the Circuit Court denied the motion, pointing 
to the fact that in Calipjo I , this court had reinstated the 
Final Judgment and had not remanded the case to the Circuit 
Court for any further proceedings. On July 9, 2019, the Circuit 
Court entered its written order titled “Order Denying 
Defendants ’ Motion: 1) To Enforce April 23, 2019 Supreme Court 
Opinion and December 22, 2017 [ICA] Decision on Remand, 2) For 
Order Directing Calipjo to Disgorge to Purdy All Monies He Paid 
in Satisfaction of the Underlying Judgment Against Him 
Personally with Applicable In terest, 3) For Reconsideration of

Order Granting in Part Plaintiff Elesther Calipjo’s Motion for 
Attorneys’ Fees and Costs Pursuant to HRS Chapter 480, and 4) 
For Taxation of Attorneys’ Fees and Costs Filed May 29, 2019 ” 
(Order Denying Motion to Enforce ). 
E. Second Appeal 
Respondents appealed to the ICA a second time . They 
argued the Circuit Court erred by denying the Motion to Enforce . 
In this second appeal, the ICA issued a SDO agreeing with 
Respondents that certain funds paid by Purdy to Calipjo should 
be disgorged. Calipjo v. Purdy , No. CAAP-19-0000538, 2024 WL 
835266 ( Haw. App. Feb. 28, 2024) (SDO) ( 2024 ICA SDO). The ICA 
reasoned that , under Calipjo I , “Purdy was liable as to Count 10 
[the UDAP claim] because he was alter ego of both Regal Corp. 
and Regal LLC.” Id. at *3 (emphasis in original) . Thus, the 
ICA held, Purdy was only jointly and severally liable on the 
judgment against Regal Corp. and Regal LLC for the UDAP claim, 
and not for the judgment against him individually on the UDAP 
claim. Id. at *4. The ICA vacated in part the Circuit Court's 
Order Denying Motion to Enforce7 and remanded the case “so that 
the Circuit Court can determine the amount that Purdy paid 
7   The ICA affirmed  in part the Order Denying Motion to Enforce  because 
it held Purdy was not entitled to statutory interest on the amount he 
purportedly overpaid and was not the prevailing party for purposes of 
attorneys’ fees under HRS §§ 607-9 (2016) and 607 -14 (2016).   Calipjo, 2024 WL 
835266,  at *4.

  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Calipjo in excess of the amounts due jointly and severally with 
the entities[ .]” Id. 
II. Discussion 
We granted Calipjo’s application for writ of 
certiorari , which presents one question to t his court : 
Whether the ICA erred in reversing in part the Circuit 
Court's July 9, 2019 Order Denying Motion to Enforce so 
that the Circuit Court can determine the amount that Purdy 
paid Calipjo in excess of the amounts due jointly and 
severally with the entities and to entertain any further 
proceedings consistent with this limited relief?  
Calipjo argues that the Judgment on Appeal entered by 
this court following Calipjo I must control pursuant to Hawaiʻi 
Rules of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP) Rule 36(d)(2). Calipjo also 
argues that we reinstated the July 18, 2014 Final Judgment and 
did not remand any issues back to the Circuit Court for further 
proceedings. Thus, Calipjo asserts we reinstated the Final 
Judgment in its entirety pursuant to the jury's verdict, with 
judgment against Purdy individually and as the alter ego of 
Regal Corp. and Regal LLC . Although Calipjo I can be read in 
varying ways, we agree with Calipjo that the intent of this 
court was to fully reinstate the Final Judgment. 
First, b oth the opinion and Judgment on Appeal in 
Calipjo I clearly reinstated the Circuit Court’s July 18, 2014 
Final Judgment. In the opinion, this court  twice stated that 
“[w]e . . . reinstate the circuit court’s July 18, 2014 final 
judgment.” 144 Hawai ‘i at 268, 282, 439 P.3d at 220, 234.  The  
12  
 
 
   
    
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
   
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Judgment on Appeal provided, “the July 18, 2014 final judgment 
of the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit is reinstated.” 
In the opinion, l anguage pertaining to the UDAP claim 
against Purdy further shows that this court intended to fully 
reinstate the Circuit Court’s Final Judgment . The title of 
Section IV.D in Calipjo I is “The Underlying Claims Against 
Purdy are Reinstated.” Id. at 281, 4 39 P.3d at 233. In that 
section, t his court stated that “the ICA erroneously overturned 
the jury’s verdict regarding alter ego and reversed the judgment 
against Purdy for breach of contract, breach of the covenant of 
good faith and fair dealing, and unfair and deceptive acts or 
practices .” Id. at 282, 439 P.3d at 234 (emphases added). Even 
though, as the ICA recognized, Purdy could not be held liable 
for Regal Corp. and Regal LLC’s actions without an alter ego 
finding, this does not mean Purdy could not also be found 
personally liable for his own UDAP. In the special verdict 
form, the jury found that: (1) Purdy was the alter ego of Regal 
Corp. and Regal LLC; and (2) Purdy personally engaged in UDAP. 
Second, Calipjo I expressly recognized that separate 
judgments were entered on Count 10 for the UDAP claim , detailing 
that the following judgments had been entered: “ $166,865.00 
against Defendant Jack Purdy, $ 166,875.00  against Defendant 
[Regal Corp.], and $7,500.00  against Defendant [Regal LLC ], plus 
statutory interest [.]” 144 Hawai‘i at 274 n.17 , 439 P.3d at 226 
13  
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
   
  
 
   
 
 
  
  
 
 
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
n.17. Thus, by reinstating the Final Judgment, this court 
intended to reinstate these amounts. 
Third, to the extent any confusion arose from the 
opinion in Calipjo I and its conclusion to reinstate the Final 
Judgment, the Respondents could have filed a motion for 
reconsideration or for clarification. No such motion was filed. 
Fourth, and importantly, Calipjo I did not remand the 
case to the Circuit Court. If Respondents’ argument was 
correct, that Purdy is entitled to require Calipjo to disgorge 
funds paid by Purdy , we would have remanded for further 
proceedings. Instead, after reinstating the Final Judgment, 
this court did not direct any further proceedings in the Circuit 
Court. 
In situations where there has been a remand, this 
court has stated : 
(1) that “[i]t is the duty of the trial court, on remand, 
to comply strictly with the mandate of the appellate court 
according to its true intent and meaning, as determined by 
the directions given by the reviewing court,” and (2) that 
“when acting under an appellate court's mandate, an 
inferior court cannot vary it, or examine it for any other 
purpose than execution; or give any other or further 
relief; . . . or intermeddle with it, further than to 
settle so much as has been remanded.” 72 Haw. at 485 –86, 
825 P.2d at 68 (internal citations and quotation signals 
omitted). 
Chun v. Bd.  of Trs.  of Emps.’ Ret.  Sys.  of State of Haw., 106 
Hawai‘i  416, 439, 106 P.3d 339, 362 (2005) (quoting in part from 
State v. Lincoln,  72 Haw. 480,  485-86,  825 P.2d 64, 68

(1992), cert. denied , 506 U.S. 846 (1992) ). Further, we have 
stated: 
On remand, a trial court must closely adhere to the 
true intent and meaning of the appellate court's mandate. . 
. . 
The “true intent and meaning” of a reviewing court's 
mandate is not to be found in a solitary word or 
decontextualized phrase, but rather in the opinion, as a 
whole, read in conjunction with the judgment and 
interpreted in light of the case's procedural history and 
context.   See  Frost v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 813 S.W.2d 
302, 305 (Mo. 1991) (“It is well settled that the mandate 
is not to be read and applied in a vacuum.  The opinion is 
part of the mandate and must be used to interpret the 
mandate .  .  .  .”)  (cleaned up).  
Matter of Hawai‘i Elec.  Light Co.,  149 Hawai‘i  239, 241, 487 P.3d 
708, 710 (2021)  (citation omitted).   As noted,  however,  there 
was no remand from Calipjo I.  
HRAP Rule 36(d)(2) , governing judgment after supreme 
court review , provides in relevant part : “If an application for 
a writ of certiorari is accepted and the judgment of the 
intermediate court of appeals is vacated or otherwise modified 
in whole or in part, a new judgment on appeal shall be entered 
by the supreme court and is effective upon entry. ” Pursuant to 
HRAP Rule 36(d)(2), Calipjo is correct that this court's May 21, 
2019 Judgment on Appeal stating that “the July 18, 2014 final 
judgment of the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit is 
reinstated ” is the effective judgment in this case. 
In sum, the ultimate disposition in Calipjo I was 
clear -to reinstate the Circuit Court’s Final Judgment. 
Further, neither the opinion nor t he Judgment on Appeal in 
15  
 
 
    
    
   
  
  
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Calipjo I remanded the case to the Circuit Court. Thus, the 
Circuit Court properly denied Purdy’s Motion to Enforce. 
The ICA erred by vacating in part the Circuit Court ’s 
July 9, 2019 Order Denying Motion to Enforce . 
III. Conclusion 
For the reasons discussed above, the ICA’s Judgment on 
Appeal entered on April 10, 2024, is reversed to the extent it 
vacated the Circuit Court’s July 9, 2019  Order Denying Motion to 
Enforce. We affirm the Circuit Court’s Order Denying Motion to 
Enforce.
