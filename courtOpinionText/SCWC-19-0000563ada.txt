 first giving Miranda
 warnings as required by article I, section 1
Evidence obtained after the illegality, acquired because of 
officers’ exploitation of that illegality, must likewise be 
suppressed, as such evidence is fruit of the poisonous tree.  10 of the Hawai‘ i Constitution, that evidence must be suppressed.  
  Here, defendant Daniel Irving James Manion was subject 
to custodial interrogation during a roadside investigation for 
operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant 
(OVUII).  But the evidence gathered after that illegality – specifically, his performance on the standardized field sobriety 
test (SFST) – was neither testimonial,
2 nor the fruit of the 
poisonous tree.  The police did not exploit the illegal interrogation because the interrogation did not lead to the 
discovery of the SFST evidence; the investigation had already 
been directed to the SFST before any illegality.   
  Manion’s performance on the SFST was accordingly admissible despite the absence of Miranda warnings preceding the 
test.

64, 85, 464 P.3d 852, 873 (2020), that a person’s performance on the SFST is 
not testimonial.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 II. BACKGROUND 
A. District Court Proceedings 
  Manion was arrested in Hawai‘ i Kai in the early hours 
of January 4, 2019, after a resident of the neighborhood heard a 
car crash into a parked vehicle and called the Honolulu Police 
Department (HPD).  The police arrived to find Manion in the driver’s seat of a damaged car, from which a fluid trail led to 
the damaged parked vehicle.  After initial inquiry into whether 
Manion was hurt, the officer came to suspect he had been driving 
while intoxicated, administered the SFST on Manion, and arrested 
him. 
  Manion was charged with OVUII in violation of Hawai‘ i 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1) (2020)
3 in the District 
Court of the First Circuit.4  Manion moved to suppress any 
statements he made during the encounter with police that led to 
his arrest for lack of Miranda warnings.  The district court 
held a hearing on the motion in which three HPD officers 
involved in the investigation, along with the Hawai‘ i Kai 
                     
3  HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) provides:  
 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle 
under the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates 
or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle: 
    (1) While under the influence of alcohol in an amount 
sufficient to impair the person’ s normal mental 
faculties or ability to care for the person and guard against casualty[.]

 resident who heard the crash, testified as to the following 
facts (as found by the district court in its written order): 
1. On January 4, 2019, at approximately 4:40 a.m., 
while patrolling the Hawai‘ i Kai area, [ HPD] Officer Corey 
Morgan (“ Officer Morgan” ) responded to a report of a motor 
vehicle collision at Kealahou Street and K[ ī]p[ū]kai Place.  
While other officers went to locate the vehicle that 
reportedly had been struck, Officer Morgan went to locate 
the “unit 1” vehicle that reportedly caused the crash, 
which the caller said might be on K[ ī]p[ū]kai Place. 
 
2. On K[ ī]p[ū]kai Place, Officer Morgan found a white 
Hyundai with extensive and severe front- end damage. 
 
Defendant was the lone occupant of the Hyundai and was 
seated in the driver’ s seat.  Officer Morgan observed a 
fluid trail from Defendant’ s Hyundai leading to the parked 
vehicle that was struck on Kealahou Street less than two blocks away. 
 3. Officer Morgan approached Defendant and asked if 
he was okay, if he was injured, if he needed an ambulance, 
and where was he coming from.  This initial exchange was 
brief
 – lasting a few seconds - as Officer Morgan tried to 
determine if Defendant needed medical attention.  Defendant 
responded that he was okay.  He also explained that after a 
“rough day,” he had gone to [Sandy Beach, also known as 
Sandy’s,] and drank a “ 40” and was heading home.  Defendant 
further explained that he was texting and that is what 
caused the accident, not his prior drinking. 
 4. During this brief encounter, Officer Morgan 
observed Defendant to have red and watery eyes and a strong 
odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from his breath. 
 5. Believing, upon observing the indicia of alcohol, 
that he had probable cause to arrest Defendant for [OVUII], 
Officer Morgan asked Defendant if he would be willing to participate in a [SFST].  Defendant agreed and stepped 
outside of his vehicle.  Defendant was not free to leave. 
 6. Officer Morgan would not have administered the 
SFST without first asking Defendant if he agreed to participate in the SFST and receiving Defendant’ s “yes” 
answer.  
 7. Prior to administering the SFST, Officer Morgan 
asked Defendant questions referred to as the Medical Rule Out (“MRO”) questions, including whether Defendant was 
taking any medications or whether he was under the care of a doctor or dentist.  Officer Morgan asked the questions to 
rule out causes, other than alcohol, that could affect 
Defendant’ s performance on the SFST.  Defendant answered 
“no” to the MRO questions. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
5 
 8. Officer Morgan would not have administered the 
SFST without first asking the MRO questions. 
 
9. The SFST consists of three tests that are 
administered in a particular order - Horizontal Gaze 
Nystagmus (“ HGN”) first, Walk and Turn (“ W&T”) second, and 
One Leg Stand (“ OLS”) third. 
 10. Prior to beginning the tests, Officer Morgan told 
Defendant he would be judged on how well he follows the instructions for each of the three tests.  Before 
administering each of the three tests, Officer Morgan 
instructed Defendant on how to perform the test.  Each time 
after instructing Defendant, Officer Morgan asked Defendant if he understood the instructions and whether he had any 
questions.  For each of the three tests, Defendant 
indicated he understood the instructions and he had no 
questions. 
 11. Officer Morgan would not have administered each 
of the three tests if he had not received Defendant’ s 
responses that he understood the instructions for the tests 
and had no questions. 
 
12. After Officer Morgan obtained Defendant’ s 
agreement to participate in the SFST, Defendant’ s responses 
to the MRO questions, and Defendant’ s affirmative responses 
that he understood the instructions for each of the three tests, Officer Morgan had Defendant perform the HGN, W&T, and OLS. 
 13. Following the SFST, HPD Officer Landon Miyamura 
(“Officer Miyamura” ) offered Defendant the Preliminary 
Alcohol Screening and then arrested Defendant for OVUII. 
 
14.
 At the main station, Officer Miyamura 
administered the intoxilyzer test to Defendant. 
 Upon 
completion of the test, Officer Miyamura showed Defendant 
the print- out from the intoxilyzer, pointed out Defendant’ s 
breath-test result, and stated, “ This is your result.”  
Defendant responded: “ That’s impossible, I only had one 
‘40’ and two fireball shots in three hours.” 
 
15. At no point in time did either officer tell 
Defendant he had the right to remain silent and anything he 
said could be used against him.  Defendant was never 
advised of any of his Miranda rights.
 
 
  The district court granted the motion to suppress, 
concluding that Manion was subjected to custodial interrogation 
without Miranda warnings.  The court first determined that *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
6 
 Manion was not in custody during the initial exchange with 
Officer Morgan, and accordingly, Manion’s statements “admitting 
to drinking a ‘40’ at Sandy’s and then explaining that his 
texting, as opposed to drinking, caused the accident” were 
admissible.  However, the district court concluded Manion was in 
custody after that initial exchange, and that he was subjected 
to custodial interrogation when Officer Morgan (1) asked Manion if he would be willing to participate in the SFST, (2) asked him 
the medical rule-out questions, and (3) asked him whether he 
understood the SFST instructions or had any questions about the 
tests.  As a result, the district court concluded that Manion’s 
“performance on the SFST is inadmissible fruit of the poisonous 
tree.”   
5
B. Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) Proceedings 
  The State appealed, and the ICA affirmed in part and 
vacated in part in a memorandum opinion.  As relevant here, the ICA concluded that Manion was in custody based on the State’s 
concession at the motion to suppress hearing.  Namely, “that 
Officer Morgan had probable cause to arrest Manion for OVUII 
after their initial exchange and before Officer Morgan asked 
                     
5  The district court also suppressed Manion’s statements after the 
breath test (“That’s impossible, I only had one ‘40’ and two fireball shots 
in three hours”) as the product of a separate violation (showing Manion the intoxilyzer results after his arrest without Miranda warnings).  The ICA 
affirmed this conclusion, which is not at issue here. 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
7 
 Manion if he would participate in the SFST.”   The ICA next 
determined that “the defendant’s performance on the [S]FST did 
not constitute an interrogation requiring Miranda warnings” 
pursuant to our decision in Uchima, 147 
Hawai‘i
 at 84-85, 464 
P.3d at 872-73, in which we held that the SFST was 
nontestimonial.  Likewise, the ICA relied on Uchima to hold that
“[a]sking Manion whether he was willing to participate in the 
SFST, whether he understood the instructions to the SFST, and 
whether he had any questions did not implicate his right to self-incrimination and did not constitute interrogation[.]”   6
 
  However, the ICA followed its published opinion in 
State v. Sagapolutele-Silva, 147 Hawai‘ i 92, 101-03, 464 P.3d 
880, 889-91 (App. 2020), and held that the medical rule-out questions were interrogation.  The ICA did not address the 
argument that the SFST was the fruit of the medical rule-out 
questions. 
C. Supreme Court Proceedings   Both the State and Manion filed applications for writ 
of certiorari seeking review of the ICA’s memorandum opinion.  
                     
6  The State’s application for writ of certiorari (which we rejected 
in any event ) did not contest the custody holding and indeed explicitly 
conceded it.  F or purposes of this opinion, therefore, Manion was in custody 
at all relevant times.   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
8 
 We rejected the State’s application and accepted Manion’s.   
Manion asks this court to consider whether the ICA erred by 
“failing to suppress all evidence and statements obtained after 
the Medical Rule-Out [] questions as the ‘fruit of the poisonous 
tree[.]’”  He also urges us to revisit our recent holding in 
Uchima, 147 Hawai‘ i at 84-85, 464 P.3d at 872-73, that “the SFST 
does not seek ‘communications’ or ‘testimony,’” arguing that 
Uchima’s reliance on State v. Wyatt, 67 Haw. 293, 687 P.2d 544 
(1984), was misplaced because the SFST has changed since Wyatt was decided.   7
III. STANDARD OF REVIEW 
“We review questions of constitutional law under the 
‘right/wrong’ standard.”  State v. Jenkins, 93 Hawai‘ i 87, 
100, 997 P.2d 13, 26 (2000) (citing State v. Toyomura, 80 
Hawai‘i 8, 15, 904 P.2d 893, 900 (1995)).  Accordingly, “we 
review the circuit court’ s ruling on a motion to suppress 
de novo to determine whether the ruling was ‘right’ or 
‘wrong.’”  State v. Kauhi, 86 Hawai‘ i 195, 197, 948 P.2d 
1036, 1038 (1997) (citing State v. Navas, 81 Hawai‘ i 113, 
123, 913 P.2d 39, 49 (1996)). 
 
State v. Lee, 149 Hawai‘ i 45, 49, 481 P.3d 52, 56 (2021) 
(brackets omitted). 
                     
7  Because we rejected the State’s application for writ of 
certiorari, which challenged the holding that the medical rule- out questions 
were interrogation, the question of whether there was an “illegality” at all 
is not before us.  Nevertheless, the holding that the medical rule- out 
questions were interrogation was correct, as we explained in State v. 
Skapinok, SCWC- 19-0000476 (Haw. 2022). *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 IV. DISCUSSION 
  The exclusionary rule is “a judicially created remedy 
designed to safeguard against future violations of 
[constitutional] rights.”  Arizona v. Evans, 514 U.S. 1, 10 
(1995).  “The Hawai‘ i exclusionary rule serves the dual purposes 
‘of deterring governmental officials from circumventing the 
protections afforded by the Hawai‘ i
 Constitution’ and of 
‘protecting the privacy rights of our citizens.’”  Lee, 149 
Hawai‘i at 49, 481 P.3d at 56 (brackets omitted) (quoting State 
v. Lopez, 78 Hawai‘ i 433, 446, 896 P.2d 889, 902 (1995)).  
Accordingly, when evidence is obtained “as a result of the 
exploitation of a previous illegal act of the police,” it, too, 
must be suppressed as “the fruit of the poisonous tree,” in 
order to ensure adequate deterrence of police actions that 
violate the constitution.  Id. 
A. The SFST Was Not the Fruit of the Illegality 
  We first address whether the evidence obtained after 
the illegality – here, asking the medical rule-out questions 
while Manion was in custody without Miranda warnings, which 
contravened article I, section 10 of the Hawai‘ i Constitution8 – 
was tainted by the Miranda violation and therefore must be Alth 
                     
8  “No person shall . . . be compelled in any criminal case to be a 
witness against oneself.”  Haw. Const. art. I, § 10.   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
10 
 of the poisonous tree.   In particular, Manion argues that 
“Manion’s responses during the SFST and performance of the SFST” 
(to which we will refer collectively as “the SFST”) must be 
suppressed.  We disagree. 9
“[T]he ‘fruit of the poisonous tree’ doctrine 
‘prohibits the use of evidence at trial which comes to 
light as a result of the exploitation of a previous illegal 
act of the police.’”  State v. Fukusaku, 85 Hawaiʻ i 462, 
475, 946 P.2d 32, 45 (1997) (quoting State v. Medeiros, 4 
Haw. App. 248, 251 n.4, 665 P.2d 181, 184 n.4 (1983)).  
“Under the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine, 
[a]dmissibility is determined by ascertaining whether the 
evidence objected to as being ‘fruit’ was discovered or 
became known by the exploitation of the prior illegality or by other means sufficiently distinguished as to purge the 
later evidence of the initial taint.”  State v. Poaipuni, 
98 Hawaiʻi 387, 392– 93, 49 P.3d 353, 358– 59 (2002) 
(alteration in original) (quoting 
Fukusaku, 85 Hawaiʻ i at 
475, 946 P.2d at 45). 
 . . . . 
 
“In other words, the ultimate question that the fruit 
of the poisonous tree doctrine poses is as follows: 
Disregarding the prior illegality, would the police 
nevertheless have discovered the evidence?”  Id. at 393, 49 
P.3d at 359. . . . 
 
Accordingly, the State’s burden is to demonstrate 
that [the purported fruit] is not a benefit gained or an 
advantage derived by the police from the prior illegality 
or that the subsequent statement has become sufficiently attenuated from the initial illegality so as to purge the 
taint. 
 
State v. Trinque, 140 Hawaiʻ i 269, 281, 400 P.3d 470, 482 (2017). 
                     
9  We note that Manion squarely raised the fruits doctrine in his 
answering brief to the ICA, but the ICA’s memorandum opinion did not address it.  We ultimately agree with the result the ICA reached.  But because fruit 
of the poisonous tree, if applicable, would require suppression of evidence acquired after the Miranda violation irrespective of whether that evidence 
was the product of interrogation, the ICA erred by failing to evaluate whether the fruits doctrine applied. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
11 
   Here, the SFST was not an “exploitation of the 
previous illegality,” Poaipuni, 98 Hawai‘ i at 392, 49 P.3d at 
358, or a “benefit gained or an advantage derived” from the Miranda violation.  Trinque, 140 Hawai‘ i at 281, 400 P.3d at 482.  
That the State cannot exploit or derive an advantage from a 
constitutional violation reflects the principle that adequately 
deterring police misconduct, a key purpose of the exclusionary 
rule, requires ensuring that police cannot profit from a 
constitutional violation by gaining an undue investigative edge 
that they would not have otherwise had.  Elkins v. United 
States, 364 U.S. 206, 217 (1960) (“The [exclusionary] rule is 
calculated . . . to deter – to compel respect for the constitutional guaranty in the only effectively available way – 
by removing the incentive to disregard it.”).  But subsequently 
obtained evidence may not be an exploitation of the illegality 
if it “did not lead the officers to search for th[e allegedly 
tainted] evidence nor direct any investigation into its 
discovery.”  Lee, 149 Hawaiʻ i at 50, 481 P.3d at 57.  In Lee, for 
instance, the defendant had locked himself in his bedroom, and 
his family, fearful of a suicide attempt, called the police.  
Id. at 48, 481 P.3d at 55.  The police opened his bedroom door, 
which we assumed to be a constitutional violation, and the 
defendant assaulted the police officers.  Id. at 48-49, 481 P.3d *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
12 
 at 55-56.  We held that evidence obtained after the illegal 
entry was not the fruit of the poisonous tree because the police 
did not “exploit that illegal entry to procure the relevant 
evidence – their observations of Lee’s actions.”  Id. at 50, 481 
P.3d at 57.  Although the police would not have gathered that evidence but for the constitutional violation (they could not 
have observed the defendant without opening the door), they were neither led “to search for” nor “direct[ed]” to discover that 
evidence because of the constitutional violation.  Id.   
  Although they immediately preceded the SFST in time, the medical rule-out questions did not give the officers 
information that “le[d] [them] to search for” evidence of 
intoxication, nor did the medical rule-out questions pique their 
suspicions such that their investigation was “direct[ed]” towards discovering evidence of intoxication.  Id.  Rather, the 
police decided to administer the SFST before committing the 
Miranda violation – the district court’s findings of fact 
reflect that Officer Morgan asked Manion to participate in the SFST, and Manion agreed, prior to any interrogation (the medical 
rule-out questions).  The officers did not exploit the 
illegality by continuing to gather evidence that they had 
already set out to gather.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
13 
   Manion argues that the medical rule-out questions were 
“a necessary predicate to the administration of the SFST.  
Indeed, the validity of the conclusion that a subject’s 
performance on the SFST indicated intoxication was contingent 
upon negative answers to the MRO questions.”  This argument is 
unpersuasive.  Although the district court found as a factual 
matter that “Officer Morgan would not have administered the SFST without first asking the MRO questions,” Officer Morgan’s 
investigation was already “direct[ed]” to the SFST before the 
medical rule-out questions, as he obtained Manion’s consent to 
administer the SFST before the interrogation.  Lee, 149 Hawaiʻ i 
at 50, 481 P.3d at 57.  In Lee, the police would not have 
observed the defendant without first opening the door, which we 
assumed was a constitutional violation.  Id.  Here, as in Lee, 
that Officer Morgan would not have continued with the SFST absent asking the medical rule-out questions does not render the 
SFST an “exploitation of the prior illegality.”  Poaipuni, 98 
Hawai‘i at 392, 49 P.3d at 358.  The medical rule-out questions 
did not point the officers toward the evidence they would 
discover from the SFST, even if certain answers to those questions (or failing to ask them at all) may have impacted 
whether they could administer the test as a practical matter.  
And though the answers to the questions provided information *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
14 
 germane to the SFST (which is, indeed, why they constitute 
interrogation, see State v. Skapinok, SCWC-19-0000476, at *36 
(Haw. 2022)), that the illegally-obtained evidence is relevant to interpreting subsequently-obtained evidence does not mean 
that discovery of the latter “exploit[s]” the former.  Poaipuni, 
98 Hawai‘ i at 392, 49 P.3d at 358.  
  Accordingly, the SFST was not fruit of the poisonous tree.   B. A Suspect’s Performance on the SFST Is Not Testimonial 
  “The privilege against self-incrimination is a bar 
against compelling communications or testimony.”  Uchima, 147 
Hawai‘i at 84, 464 P.3d at 872 (brackets and quotation marks 
omitted) (quoting Wyatt, 67 Haw. at 303, 687 at 551).  
Accordingly, if performance on the SFST is testimonial, it, like the answers to the medical rule-out questions, would constitute 
statements adduced in violation of Miranda.
10  But as we settled 
in Wyatt and recently reaffirmed in Uchima, performance on the 
SFST is not testimonial.   
  “[I]n order to be testimonial, an accused’s 
communication must itself, explicitly or implicitly, relate a 
                     
10  In this way, the theory that the SFST is testimonial would 
independently require suppression of that evidence as a new Miranda 
violation, separate and apart from the (ultimately unsuccessful) argument 
that the SFST is the fruit of an earlier Miranda violation.

15 
 factual assertion or disclose information.”  Pennsylvania v. 
Muniz, 496 U.S. 582, 594 (1990) (citation omitted).  We first 
considered whether a field sobriety test was testimonial in 
Wyatt, wherein the defendant was asked to perform a three-
component battery of tests similar – though not identical – to  
the SFST at issue in this case.   We explained that “the 
privilege against self-incrimination is not necessarily 
implicated whenever a person suspected of criminal activity is 
compelled in some way to cooperate in developing evidence which 
may be used against him.”  Wyatt, 67 Haw. at 302, 687 P.2d at 
551.  We relied on Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 763-64 
(1966), in which the United States Supreme Court held that a 
blood draw was nontestimonial because it was “real or physical 11
                     
11  Specifically, the defendant participated in the following:  
 
(a) The arch back test which requires the driver to stand 
with her back arched and her eyes closed; (b) the heel walk 
test where the officer requests the driver to take six 
steps down, turn to the right, and take seven steps back.  Each step requires contact between the heel of one foot and 
the toe of the other foot; and (c) the leg lift test where 
the driver places her hands behind her head, interlocking 
her fingers, lifts one leg fifteen inches off the ground 
and holds it straight ahead of her for fifteen seconds.  
 
Wyatt, 67 Haw. at 301 n.8, 687 P.2d at 550 n.8. 
 
  Components (b) and (c) of the above appear virtually identical to 
the walk- and-turn and one- leg-stand tests respectively.  Only component (a) 
differs from the SFST at issue in this case; Manion was given the HGN test 
instead of the arch back test.  Manion argues that this difference warrants 
revisiting Wyatt and its progeny.  However, he fails to explain why this 
difference would be meaningful.  In any event, the test at issue in Uchima 
was identical to the one given in the instant case.  147 Hawai‘i at 70, 464 
P.3d at 858.  Uchima, therefore, belies Manion’s argument that we should 
revisit these cases because the SFST has changed. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
16 
 evidence,” to hold that the field sobriety test merely sought 
“an exhibition of ‘physical characteristics of coordination,’” 
and the defendant’s participation in the test therefore did not 
violate the privilege against self-incrimination.  Wyatt, 67 
Haw. at 302-03, 687 P.2d at 551 (quoting State v. Arsenault, 336 
A.2d 244, 247 (1975)).   
  We reaffirmed this holding in Uchima:  
[The defendant’s] performance on the [S]FST does not 
constitute incriminating statements. . . .  In Wyatt, this 
court held that when conducting an [S]FST the State does 
not seek “communications” or “testimony,” but rather, “an 
exhibition of ‘physical characteristics of coordination.’” 
. . .  Here, [the officer administering the SFST] did not 
seek “communications” or “testimony” from [the defendant].  
Rather, in conducting the [S]FST, the officer sought “an exhibition of ‘physical characteristics of coordination.’”  
“Consequently, the field sobriety test was not rendered 
infirm by the constitutionally guaranteed privilege against 
compulsory self- incrimination.”

  Uchima was correctly decided, and Manion offers no 
compelling reason to revisit it.  Manion argues that SFST 
performance is “communication” or “testimony” because it “tests 
mental capability instead of just purely physical coordination.”  
But this is not what it means to be “testimonial.”  Purely physical evidence can provide incriminating information about a 
person’s mental faculties yet nonetheless be nontestimonial.  
Muniz, 496 U.S. at 593 (“[T]hat the ‘fact’ to be inferred might 
be said to concern the physical status of [the defendant’s] *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 brain merely describes the way in which the inference is 
incriminating.  The correct question for . . . purposes [of 
determining whether there has been a Miranda violation] is 
whether the incriminating inference of mental confusion is drawn from a testimonial act or from physical evidence.”). 
  Slurred speech is an apt example.  In Pennsylvania v. 
Muniz, the United States Supreme Court considered whether asking 
a suspect accused of driving while intoxicated the date of his 
sixth birthday was testimonial.  496 U.S. at 590–93.  The Court 
distinguished between the content of the answer – which revealed 
that the defendant was unable to remember the date of his sixth 
birthday – and the way in which the answer was given.  Id.  The 
former was testimonial because it “convey[ed] information or assert[ed] facts.”
12  Id. at 597 (quoting Doe v. United States, 
487 U.S. 201, 213 (1988)).  But the act of slurring the response 
was not: 
We agree with the [prosecution’s] contention that 
[the defendant’s] answers are not rendered inadmissible by 
Miranda merely because the slurred nature of his speech was 
incriminating.  The physical inability to articulate words 
in a clear manner due to “ the lack of muscular coordination 
of his tongue and mouth,” . . . is not itself a testimonial 
component of [the defendant’s] responses . . . .   
 
                     
12  Muniz recognized that “‘[t]he vast majority of verbal statements 
thus will be testimonial’ because ‘[t]here are very few instances in which a verbal statement, either oral or written, will not convey information or 
assert facts.’”  496 U.S. at 597 (brackets in original) (quoting Doe, 487 
U.S. at 213). *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 [A]ny slurring of speech and other evidence of lack 
of muscular coordination revealed by [the defendant’s] 
responses to [the officer’s] direct questions constitute 
nontestimonial components of those responses.  Requiring a 
suspect to reveal the physical manner in which he 
articulates words, like requiring him to reveal the 
physical properties of the sound produced by his voice, . . . does not, without more, compel him to provide a 
“testimonial” response for purposes of the privilege. 
 
Muniz, 496 U.S. at 590–92 (citations omitted). 
  The SFST, like the slurring of words, is 
nontestimonial in that it constitutes “an exhibition of physical 
characteristics of coordination.”  Uchima, 147 Hawai‘ i at 84, 464 
P.3d at 872 (quotation marks and citation omitted).  We 
therefore see no reason to revisit our recent holding in Uchima, 
with which we continue to agree.
