CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
(CAAP-19-0000583; CASE NO. FC- J 0105711)  
 
OCTOBER 10, 2022 
 
RECKTENWALD, C.J., NAKAYAMA, McKENNA, WILSON, AND EDDINS, JJ.
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J.  
 
I. Introduction  
 This case arises from an adjudication of GH (“Minor”), a 
teenager at the time, as a law violator by the Family Court of 
the First Circuit (“family court ”), for sexually assaulting the 
complaining witness (“CW”), who was nine years old at the time 
of the assault.   
 On certiorari, Minor alleges the Intermediate Court  of 
Appeals (“ICA”) erred by (1) affirming the family court’s Electronically Filed
Supreme Court

2 exclusion, based on Rule 412  (2016) of the Hawaiʻi Rules of 
Evidence (“HRE”), of Minor’s proffered extrinsic evidence of 
CW’s past false sexual assault allegations ; (2) concluding the 
family cou rt had not erred by failing to make a preliminary 
determination as to the truth or falsity of CW’s past sexual 
assault allegations, as required by State v. West, 95 Hawaiʻi 
452, 24 P.3d 648 (2001) ; and (3) concluding there was sufficient 
evidence to deem M inor a law violator.  
 We preliminarily address the untimeliness of Minor’s 
certiorari application, which was filed more than eight months 
after the ICA ’s October 30, 2020 judgment on appeal.  In State 
v. Uchima , 147 Hawaiʻi 64, 464 P.3d 852 (2020), we held  that a 
defendant in a criminal case has the right to effective 
assistance of counsel during all stages of an appeal, which 
includes procedural compliance with the statutory requirements 
for filing an application for writ of certiorari.  147 Hawaiʻi at 
79, 464 P.3d at 867.  We have also held that “[b]ecause 
effective assistance of counsel is fundamental to a fair trial, 
it should be guaranteed in  juvenile  law violator proceedings as 
have other fundamental criminal case guarantees.”  In re Doe , 
107 Hawaiʻi 12, 16, 108 P.3d 966, 970 (2005).  Hence, Uchima’s 
holding applies to juvenile law violation cases.  
 Addressing the merits, we hold that (1) u nder the 
circumstances of this case, it was an abuse of discretion for ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
3  the family court to exclude the proffered ev idence based on the 
procedural notice requirements of HRE Rule 412; (2) as further 
discussed below, if a defendant seeks to admit a complaining 
witness’s false allegations of sexual assault, then 
admissibility of such evidence is not subject to HRE Rule 41 2 or 
West, 95 Hawaiʻi 452, 24 P.3d 648; and (3) Minor’s insufficiency 
of evidence argument lacks merit.  
 We therefore vacate the ICA ’s October 30, 2020 judgment on 
appeal as well as the family court ’s June 5, 2019 decree, July 
23, 2019 order, and Septembe r 24, 2019 findings of fact and 
conclusions of law.  We remand to the family court for 
proceedings consistent with this opinion.  
II. Background  
A. Family court proceedings  
1. Charges 
On February 5, 2019, the State of Hawaiʻi (“the State”) 
filed six amended  petitions against  Minor1: one for first -degree 
                                                 
1  Minor comes within the purview of Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (“HRS”) § 
571-11 (2018), which states in relevant part:  
 
Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the court 
shall have exclusive original jurisdiction in proceedings:  
 
(1) Concerning any person who is alleged to have 
committed an act prior to achieving eighteen years of 
age that would constitute a violation or attempted 
violation of any federal, state, or local law or 
county ordinance.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
4 sexual assault,2 four for third -degree sexual assault,3 and one 
for attempted first -degree sexual assault.4 
2. Motion in limine and hearing on the motion  
 On February 8, 2019, the State filed a motion in limi ne 
based on HRE Rule 4125 to prohibit the defense and witnesses from 
referring to “[a]ny evidence, including but not limited to 
reputation and/or opinion, relating to the past sexual history, 
behavior and/or character of [CW].”  At the time, trial was 
scheduled for April 17, 2019.  The State said it had reviewed 
child welfare reports and believed Minor might attempt to 
inquire into the past sexual history of CW in violation of HRE 
Rule 412.  Minor did not file a memorandum in response to this 
motion.  Minor  also did not file any HRE Rule 412(c) notice or 
                                                 
2  HRS § 707 -730 (2014) provided  in relevant part : “(1) A person commits 
the offense of sexual assault in the first degree if: . . . (b) The person 
knowingly engages in sexual penetration with another person who is less than 
fourteen years old [.]” 
 
3  HRS § 707 -732 (2014) provided  in relevant part : “(1) A p erson commits 
the offense of sexual assault in the third degree if: . . . (b) The person 
knowingly subjects to sexual contact another person who is less than fourteen 
years old or causes such a person to have sexual contact with the person [.]” 
 
4  HRS § 70 5-500 (2014) provides in relevant part : 
 
(1) A person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if 
the person:  
. . . . 
(b) Intentionally engages in conduct which, under the 
circumstances as the person believes them to be, 
constitutes a substantial step in a course of conduct 
intended to culminate in the person’s commission of 
the crime.  
 
5  See infra Section IV.B.1 for relevant portions of HRE Rule 412 . ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
5 motion regarding CW’s past sexual behavior allegations of sexual 
assault by others.   
 Just before beginning the rescheduled June 4, 2019 bench 
trial, the family court heard the State’s motion in limine.  Th e 
State indicated Minor might attempt to inquire into CW’s past 
sexual history, which it said must be excluded under HRE Rule 
412.  Minor responded that although he would not offer evidence 
of CW’s past sexual conduct, he would be going into accusations 
she had made against others.  
3. Bench trial  
At trial, various witnesses testified.  CW testified as 
follows:  
She was sexually assaulted by Minor when she was nine years 
old.  At the time, she lived with her mother and father, two 
older sisters, the sisters’  boyfriends, and her little sister.  
She met Minor as a friend of a neighbor with whom she often 
spent time.  She came to view Minor as an older brother, and 
Minor often slept over at her house.  
One night, Minor came into her room and sexually assaulted 
her.  CW described the assault in detail.  Minor told her that 
if she told anyone, something would happen to her.  CW did not 
speak about what happened until she told a hospital employee.  
CW was later transferred into the care of a foster mother, 
her aunt.  Her aunt had a daughter, CW’s cousin, who was three ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
6 years older.  After moving in with her aunt,  CW went to the 
Children’s Justice Center (“CJC”) and spoke with an interviewer 
about the sexual assault by Minor.  She was later taken to a 
doctor for a physic al examination.  
On cross -examination, Minor asked CW whether she had told 
her cousin that her sister’s boyfriend had sexually assaulted 
her.  CW responded she had told her cousin that her sister’s 
boyfriend would watch her when she slept, but denied saying  he 
had touched her sexually.  Minor asked the same question 
regarding CW’s father.  CW responded she had only told her 
cousin her father at times made her feel uncomfortable.  Minor 
also asked whether CW told her cousin that another cousin had 
touched and  raped her.  The court sustained the State’s 
objection to this question.  
Minor then also asked whether CW had told her aunt she had 
been sexually assaulted by her father.   The State objected on 
relevance and hearsay grounds.  Minor responded he was 
attempting to cross -examine CW regarding past false accusations 
of sexual assault, stating “when the [CW] made a statement to 
the police, she denied these false accusations.”  The family 
court concluded it would “allow some leeway” and permitted Minor 
to ask CW w hether she had told her aunt she had been sexually 
assaulted by her father.  CW again responded she had not said ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
7 that her father sexually assaulted her, but that certain things 
he did had made her uncomfortable.  
 Minor then attempted to adduce extrinsic ev idence of CW’s 
alleged false sexual assault allegations.  Minor called CW’s 
aunt as a witness and asked what CW had said about being 
sexually assaulted.  The family court sua sponte disallowed a 
response on hearsay grounds.6  Minor then indicated he was re ady 
to call CW’s cousin to the stand to ask similar questions about 
CW’s false allegations, but the family court disallowed any such 
testimony.7 
 At the close of evidence, the family court ruled it had 
properly excluded testimony from others concerning  CW’s past 
statements regarding other alleged sexual assaults because Minor 
never filed a HRE Rule 412 motion with fifteen  days’ notice 
before trial.  Minor argued that a HRE Rule 412 motion was not 
necessary because the defense only intended to ask about fals e 
accusations, not sexual behavior, but the family court 
disagreed.  
 
 
                                                 
6  The anticipated evidence was not being proffered for the truth of the 
matter asserted.  
 
7  Minor also questioned Detective Cadiz, who had watched the CJC 
interview through a window, about what CW had said.  Defense counsel 
attempted to elicit evidence that, contrary to her trial testimony, CW never 
said that her father made her uncomfortable.  
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
8 4. Adjudication and sentence  
 The family court then adjudicated Minor a law violator on 
one count of first -degree sexual assault and two counts of 
third-degree sexual assault and dismisse d the remaining counts 
with prejudice.  The family court committed Minor to the custody 
of the Office of Youth Services for commitment to the Hawaiʻi 
Youth Correctional Facility until age nineteen, with orders for 
the Minor to be referred for behavioral se rvices.  On June 5, 
2019, the family court filed its “Decree Re: Law Violation 
Petition(s)” (“June 5, 2019 decree”).  
5. Post-trial motions  
 On June 13, 2019, Minor moved for a new trial, arguing the 
family court erred in precluding Minor from eliciting evi dence 
of CW’s false accusations of sexual assault by others.  Citing 
to West, 95 Hawaiʻi 452, 24 P.3d 648, Minor asserted such 
evidence was not “sexual conduct” evidence under HRE Rule 412.  
Minor also alternatively argued that, pursuant to West, the 
family court erred in not making a preliminary determination as 
to the falsity of CW’s prio r allegations.  Minor argued he would 
have met his burden of proving that CW’s statements were false.  
Minor also asserted that there were “prejudicial violations of 
the Minor’s constitutional rights” and that he had been denied a 
fair trial.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
9  On July 23, 2019, the family court affirmed its evidentiary 
rulings based on Minor’s failure to file a HRE Rule 412 motion 
before trial (“July 23, 2019 order”).  The family court’s post -
appeal September 24, 2019 findings of fact and conclusions of 
law stated (1) defen se counsel never filed a HRE Rule 412 motion 
before trial; (2) under West, 95 Hawaiʻi at 459, 24 P.3d at 655, 
“where the truth or falsity of a statement regarding an 
unrelated sexual assault is unknown, it falls within the purview 
of the rape shield statut e and must be analyzed accordingly”; 
(3) defense counsel only asserted CW’s prior statements may have 
been false; and (4) because the threshold of falsity was not 
met, CW’s statements fell within HRE Rule 412 and were properly 
excluded.   
B. ICA proceedings  
 On appeal to the ICA, Minor argued the family court erred 
because (1) evidence of CW’s prior inconsistent statements about 
prior sexual assaults should have been admitted under HRE Rule 
613(b) (2016);8 (2) CW’s allegations should not have been 
excluded u nder HRE Rule 412 because West held that a complaining 
witness’s false statements of prior unrelated sexual assaults 
                                                 
8  HRE Rule 613(b) provides:  
 
Extrinsic evidence of prior inconsistent statement of 
witness.  Extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent 
statement by a witness is not admissible unless, on direct 
or cross -examination, (1) the circumstances of the 
statement have been b rought to the attention of the 
witness, and (2) the witness has been asked whether the 
witness made the statement.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
10 are not excluded by HRE Rule 412 ; (3) in any event, the family 
court should have made a preliminary determination as to the 
falsity of CW’s  prior allegations based on West; and (4) there 
was insufficient evidence that he was a law violator.  
 In its summary disposition order, the ICA held evidence of 
CW’s past sexual assault allegations was inadmissible under HRE 
Rule 412.  The ICA concluded t he family court did not err in not 
making a preliminary determination as to the falsity of CW’s 
allegations because Minor failed to comply with HRE Rule 
412(c)’s written notice requirement.  The ICA also held that 
even though the family court had not made a preliminary 
determination as to falsity, the family court could find in its 
post-trial findings that falsity had not been shown.  
Additionally, the ICA held CW’s inconsistent statements 
inadmissible under HRE Rule 613 because HRE Rule 412, a law of 
specific application, controls  over HRE Rule 613, a law of 
general application.  Finally, the ICA held there was sufficient 
evidence to support Minor’s adjudication as a law violator.  The 
ICA thus affirmed the family court’s June 5, 2019 decree and 
July 23, 20 19 order.  
C. Supreme Court proceedings  
 More than eight months after the ICA’s October 30, 
2020 judgment on appeal, Minor ’s counsel filed an untimely 
certiorari application.  Defense counsel states, “Due to ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
11 counsel’s error, an application for writ of certi orari was 
not filed in a timely fashion in the above -entitled matter.  
However, pursuant to the principles outlined in State v. 
Uchima, . . . we ask that this court consider the arguments 
and representations presented herein.”  
III. Standards of review  
A. Jurisdiction  
The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law and is 
reviewed de novo under the right/wrong standard.  Lingle v. Haw. 
Gov’t Emps. Ass’n, Local 152 , 107 Hawaiʻi 178, 182, 111 P.3d 587, 
591 (2005).  
B.  Admissibility of evidence  
When application of a particular evidentiary rule can yield 
only one correct result, the proper standard for appellate 
review is the right/wrong standard.  However, the 
traditional abuse  of discretion standard should be applied 
in the case of those rules of evidence that require a 
“judgment call” on the part of the trial court.  
  
State v. Heggland , 118 Hawaiʻi 425, 434, 193 P.3d 341, 350 (2008) 
(citation omitted).  
C. Exclusion of admiss ible evidence  
 A trial court’s error in excluding evidence prejudicially 
affects a defendant’s right to a fair trial and requires vacatur 
unless the exclusion was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  
See State v. Kato, 147 Hawaiʻi 478, 497, 465 P.3d 925, 9 44 
(2020); State v. Abion, 148 Hawaiʻi 445, 448, 478 P.3d 270, 273 
(2020). ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
12 D. Statutory interpretation  
 The interpretation  of a statute is a question of law 
that this court reviews de novo.   When construing a 
statute, our foremost obligation is to ascertai n and give 
effect to the intention of the legislature, which is to be 
obtained primarily from the language contained in the 
statute itself.  And we must read statutory language in the 
context of the entire statute and construe it in a manner 
consistent wit h its purpose.   
 
Abion, 148 Hawaiʻi at 454, 478 P.3d at 279 (citations omitted).  
E.  Sufficiency of the evidence  
Evidence adduced in the trial court must be considered in 
the strongest light for the prosecution when the appellate 
court passes on the legal sufficiency of such evidence to 
support a conviction.  The test on appeal is not whether 
guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether 
there was substantial evidence to support the conclusion of 
the trier of fact .  Indeed, even if it could be said in a 
bench trial that the c onviction is against the weight of 
the evidence, as long as there is substantial evidence to 
support the requisite findings for conviction, the trial 
court will be affirmed.  Substantial evidence is credible 
evidence which is of sufficient quality and prob ative value 
to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a 
conclusion.  
 
State v. Xiao , 123 Hawaiʻi 251, 257, 231 P.3d 968, 974 (2010) 
(cleaned up).  
IV. Discussion  
A.  Uchima applies to juvenile proceedings  
Minor’s certiorari application was filed ap proximately 
eight months after the ICA’s judgment on appeal.  Under HRS § 
602-59(a) and (c) ( 2016 & Supp. 201 7), however, a party has up 
to thirty days after the ICA’s judgment on appeal or dismissal 
order to file a certiorari application with this court.  A party 
may extend this deadline by an additional thirty days upon 
written request.  HRS § 602 -59(c).   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
13  In Uchima, 147 Hawaiʻi at 82, 464 P.3d at 870, we held this 
court may “decline to dismiss an application for writ of 
certiorari as untimely and proceed to review its merits when it 
is plain from the record that defense counsel failed to comply 
with the procedural requirements  for filing the application.”  
(Citation omitted ).  Uchima held that the Hawaiʻi Constitution 
“guarantees a defendant in a criminal case the right to the 
effective assistance of counsel on certiorari review in the same 
manner that it does during all other critical stages of the 
criminal proceedings.”  147 Hawaiʻi at 76, 464 P.3d at 864.  
 This court has also held that “[b]ecause effective 
assistance of counsel is fundamental to a fair trial, it should 
be guaranteed in juvenile law violator proceedings as ha ve other 
fundamental criminal case guarantees.”  In re Doe , 107 Hawaiʻi 
12, 16, 108 P.3d 966, 970 (2005).  Hence, Uchima also applies to 
juvenile law violation proceedings.  
 Here, defense counsel admitted ineffective assistance of 
counsel, indicating in t he certiorari application that “ [d]ue to 
counsel’s error, an application for writ of certiorari was not 
filed in a timely fashion [.]”  We therefore decline to dismiss 
Minor’s certiorari application and now turn to its merits.  We 
address Minor’s questions on certiorari as follows.  
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
14 B. The proffered evidence should not have been excluded    
 At trial, Minor sought to introduce extrinsic evidence that 
CW made false statements of sexual assault against others.  The 
family court and ICA held the proffered eviden ce inadmissible 
based on HRE Rule 412 , as applied by  West, 95 Hawaiʻi 452, 24 
P.3d 648.  
1. HRE Rule 412 ’s plain language renders it inapplicable  
  to false allegations of sexual assault  
 HRE Rule 412 provides in relevant part as follows:  
Rule 412 .  Sexual offense and sexual harassment cases; 
relevance of victim ’s past behavior.    
 
(a)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in a 
criminal case in which a person is accused of a sexual 
offense, reputation or opinion evidence of the past sexual 
behavior o f an alleged victim of the sexual offense is not 
admissible to prove the character of the victim to show 
action in conformity therewith.       
 
 (b)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in a 
criminal case in which a person is accused of a sexual 
offense, evidence of an alleged victim ’s past sexual 
behavior other than reputation or opinion evidence is not 
admissible to prove the character of the victim to show 
action in conformity therewith, unless the evidence is:  
 
(1)  Admitted in accordance with su bsection 
(c)(1) and (2) and is constitutionally required to be 
admitted; or  
 
(2)  Admitted in accordance with subsection (c) 
and is evidence of:  
 
(A)  Past sexual behavior with persons 
other than the accused, offered by the accused 
upon the issue of whethe r the accused was or  
was not, with respect to the alleged victim, 
the source of semen or  injury; or  
 
(B)  Past sexual behavior with the  
accused and is offered by the accused upon the 
issue of whether the alleged victim consented 
to the sexual  behavior with  respect to which 
sexual assault is alleged.  
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
15     (c)(1)  If the person accused of committing a sexual 
offense intends to offer under subsection (b) evidence of 
specific instances of the alleged victim ’s past sexual 
behavior, the accused shall make a writt en motion to offer 
the evidence not later than fifteen days before the date on 
which the trial in which the evidence is to be offered is 
scheduled to begin, except that the court may allow the 
motion to be made at a later date, including during trial, 
if the court determines either that the evidence is newly 
discovered and could not have been obtained earlier through 
the exercise of due diligence or that the issue to which 
the evidence relates has newly arisen in the case.   Any 
motion made under this paragr aph shall be served on all 
other parties and on the alleged victim.  
 
(2)  The motion described in paragraph (1) 
shall be accompanied by a written offer of proof.   If 
the court determines that the offer of proof contains 
evidence described in subsection (b) , the court shall 
order a hearing in chambers to determine if the 
evidence is admissible.   At the hearing, the parties 
may call witnesses, including the alleged victim, and 
offer relevant evidence.   Notwithstanding subsection 
(b) of rule 104, if the releva ncy of the evidence 
that the accused seeks to offer in the trial depends 
upon the fulfillment of a condition of fact, the 
court, at the hearing in chambers or at a subsequent 
hearing in chambers scheduled for this purpose, shall 
accept evidence on the issu e of whether the condition 
of fact is fulfilled and shall determine the issue.  
 
(3)  If the court determines on the basis of 
the hearing described in paragraph (2) that the 
evidence that the accused seeks to offer is relevant 
and that the probative value o f the evidence 
outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice, the 
evidence shall be admissible in the trial to the 
extent an order made by the court specifies evidence 
that may be offered and areas with respect to which 
the alleged victim may be examined or cro ss-examined.  
 
  . . . . 
 
     (h)  For purposes of this rule, the term “past sexual 
behavior ” means sexual behavior other than the sexual 
behavior with respect to which a sexual offense or sexual 
harassment is alleged.  
 
 HRE Rule 412 prohibits evidence of a complaining witness’s 
“past sexual behavior” in a criminal case in which a defendant 
is charged with sexual assault when offered for certain 
purposes.  HRE Rule 412(h) defines “past sexual behavior” as ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
16 “sexual behavior other than the sexual behavior with  respect to 
which a sexual offense or sexual harassment is alleged.”   
State v. Kelekolio , 74 Haw. 479, 849 P.2d 58 (1993), noted 
that although HRE Rule 412 does not define “behavior” as used in 
the term “sexual behavior,” it “pertains to the admissibility  of 
the sexual assault victim’s past sexual conduct.”  74 Haw. at 
521 n.19, 849 P.2d at 77 n.19  (cleaned up) (citing S. Stand. 
Comm. Rep. No. 22 –80, in 1980 Senate Journal, at 1034).  We 
pointed out that “conduct” means a “mode of action” or 
“something don e.”  Id. (first quoting  Conduct, Black’s Law 
Dictionary  (6th ed. 1990) ; and then quoting Action, Black’s Law 
Dictionary  (6th ed. 1990)).  Hence, Kelekolio  concluded that 
false allegations of sexual activity do not fall under HRE Rule 
412.  See 74 Haw. at 5 21, 849 P.2d at 77.9   
2. West  
In West, defense counsel sought to introduce evidence 
regarding a four -year-old’s statement that she had been sexually 
                                                 
9  In Kelekolio , the complaining witness had Down syndrome and functioned 
at the cognitive level of a four - to seven -year-old.  74 Haw. at 48 6, 849 
P.2d at 63.  The defendant sought to introduce evidence that the complaining 
witness habitually fantasized about sex, had previously reported sexual 
encounters with an imaginary boyfriend, and had previously reported that she 
was pregnant when she w as not.  74 Haw. at 4 89-498, 849 P.2d at 6 4-68.  The 
defendant argued that if the complaining witness previously fantasized sexual 
events, then the jury could find that she fantasized the alleged sexual 
assault by the defendant.  74 Haw. at 520, 849 P.2d a t 77. 
    
 Because the defendant had not presented an offer of proof explaining 
that he was not seeking to adduce evidence of the complainant’s past sexual 
behavior, however, this court affirmed the trial court’s exclusion of the 
proffered evidence.  74 Haw. at 522 -23, 849 P.2d at 7 8.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
17 assaulted by someone other than the defendant .  95 Hawaiʻi at 
454-55, 24 P.3d at 650 -51.  Defense counsel  sought admission of 
the evidence, but indicated it was unclear whether the 
statements of the four -year-old were true or false.  95 Hawaiʻi 
at 455, 24 P.3d at 65 1.   
West initially recognized cases holding that evidence of 
false statements of unrelated sex ual assaults are not excluded 
by HRE Rule 412 because they are not evidence of sexual conduct.  
95 Hawaiʻi at 457-58, 24 P.3d at 653 -54.  But we noted that 
courts have made admissibility of sexual assault allegations 
dependent on actual falsity and have required a threshold 
determination regarding truth or falsity.  95 Hawaiʻi at 458, 24 
P.3d at 654.10  We held that :  
where a defendant seeks to admit allegedly false statements 
made by a complainant regarding an unrelated sexual 
assault, the trial court must make a preliminary 
determination based on a preponderance of the evidence that 
the statements are false.  Correlatively, where the trial 
                                                 
10  Some states’ rape shield statutes  specifically allow evidence of false 
sexual assault allegations  when the probative value of such evidence 
outweighs potential prejudice .  See ARIZ. REV. STAT. ANN. § 13-1421(A)(5) (202 2) 
(allowing evidence of  “false allegations of sexual misconduct made by the 
victim against others”); IDAHO R. EVID. Rule 412(b)(3) (2022) (allowing  “false 
allegations of sex crimes made at an earlier time”); MISS. R. EVID. Rule 
412(b)(2) (2022) (allowing  “ false allegations of sexual offenses made at any 
time before trial by the victim ”); OKLA. STAT. tit. 12, § 2412(B)(2) (202 2) 
(allowing  “[f]alse allegations of sexual offenses”); VT. STAT. ANN. tit. 13, § 
3255(a)(3)(C) (202 2) (allowing  “evidence of specific i nstances of the 
complaining witness’ past false allegations of violations of this chapter”); 
WIS. STAT. § 972.11(2)(b)(3) (202 2) (allowing  “[e]vidence of prior untruthful 
allegations of sexual assault made by the complaining witness”).  
 
 Other states’ rape  shield statutes do not specifically reference false 
sexual assault allegations, and admission of such evidence appears dependent 
on caselaw.  See, e.g. , Miller v. State , 779 P.2d 87 (Nev. 1989); Clinebell 
v. Commonwealth , 368 S.E.2d 263 (Va. 1988).  
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
18 court is unable to determine by a preponderance of the 
evidence that the statement is false, the defendant has 
failed t o meet [their] burden, and the evidence may be 
properly excluded.  
 
95 Hawaiʻi at 460, 24 P.3d at 656.  
 Hence, West conditioned admissibility of unrelated sexual 
assault evidence  upon compliance with HRE Rule 412 procedural 
requirements even when the defense proffers the evidence based 
on falsity.  See id.  In addition, West imposed a requirement on 
trial courts to make a threshold determination as to truth or 
falsity and expressly determine falsity before admitting any 
such evidence.  See id.  We indicated we were doing so because  
“to permit reception of evidence which may be tru e or false 
would allow circumvention of the rape shield statute because the 
jury may be tempted to consider evidence about an alleged 
victim’s sexual conduct in order to determine the victim’s 
credibility. ” 95 Hawaiʻi at 459, 24 P.3d at 655 (cleaned up).  
3. West’s procedural notice requirements have been   
  limited by Pond 
 Based on West, both the family court and the ICA concluded 
that Minor’s failure to file a HRE Rule 412(c)(1) notice or 
motion at least fifteen days before trial precluded him from 
introducing extrinsic evidence of allegedly false allegations of 
sexual assault CW had made to others.  
 Under the circumstances of this case, however, the 
proffered evidence should not have been excluded based on HRE ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
19 Rule 412.  This is because the procedural requirements of HRE 
Rule 412 have been limited by State v. Pond , 118 Hawaiʻi 452, 193 
P.3d 368 (2008).  
 As noted, the State filed a HRE Rule 412 motion in limine 
on February 8, 2019, more than two months before the then -
scheduled April 17, 2019 trial date.  When the motion was filed, 
it was scheduled to be heard on March 4, 2019 .  After the motion 
in limine was filed , the trial date was continued to June 4, 
2019.  For some reason, the motion was never heard before the 
June 4, 2019 trial date, although the motion was originally 
scheduled to be heard well before trial and it appear s there 
were various pretrial conferences.  
 Pond, 118 Hawaiʻi 452, 193 P.3d 368, addressed HRE Rule 
404(b)’s  (2016) requirement that the proponent of “prior bad 
act” evidence give “reasonable notice. ”  In doing so, we 
discussed United States Supreme Court precedent regarding the 
constitutionality of and reasons fo r notice requirements in the 
context of rape shield statutes like HRE Rule 412:  
The rape shield statute, designed to protect victims 
of rape from being subjected to harassing or irrelevant 
questions concerning their past sexual behavior , permits a 
defendant to introduce evidence of [their] own past sexual 
conduct with the victim if the defendant files a written 
motion and an offer of proof within ten days after he is 
arraigned.  . . .   
 
The Supreme Court recognized that the rape shield 
statute implicates t he sixth amendment and that , to the 
extent that it operates to prevent a criminal defendant 
from presenting relevant evidence, the defendant’s ability 
to confront adverse witnesses and present a defense is ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
20 diminished.  This does not necessarily render the statute 
unconstitutional.  [The Court]  observed that the 
defendant’s right to present relevant evidence may, in 
appropriate cases, bow to accommodate other legitimate 
interests in the criminal trial process.  
 
Pursuant to this rule, the Supreme Court recogn ized 
the state ’s interest in the policy underlying the rape 
shield statute's procedural prerequisites —to 
protect rape victims from surprise, harassment, and 
invasions of privacy, and permit the prosecution to 
investigate the evidence . . . . Based on its pr ior rulings 
and the state’s interest in the  rape shield statute,  [the 
Court] ruled that precluding evidence based on 
the rape shield statute’s notice requirement is not  per 
se unconstitutional.   However, it remanded the case to 
determine whether the trial court abused its discretion by 
precluding [the defendant’s] evidence .  
  
Pond, 118 Hawaiʻi at 464-65, 193 P.3d at 380 -81 (cleaned up).   
 Pond recognizes that although constitutional rights 
implicated by a rape -shield statute are not automatically 
violated  by notice requirements, such notice requirements must 
further “legitimate interests,” which are to “protect rape 
victims from surprise, harassment, and invasions of privacy, and 
permit the prosecution to investigate the evidence.”  See id.  
Pond also reco gnized that the notice requirement is subject to 
an abuse of discretion review.  See 118 Hawaiʻi at 461, 193 P.3d 
at 377. 
 Whether or not HRE Rule 412 applies to false allegations of 
sexual assault, under the circumstances of this case, it was an 
abuse of discretion for the family court to exclude the 
proffered evidence based on the procedural noti ce requirements 
of HRE Rule 412.  The State knew about the evidence and filed a 
HRE Rule 412 motion in limine months before trial.  The State’s ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
21 motion and its arguments at the June 4, 2019 hearing indicate it 
filed the HRE Rule 412 motion in limine because  it had reviewed 
the child welfare reports and was aware that evidence regarding 
sexual assaults by others could be elicited by Minor.  The State 
was not surprised and was not precluded from investigating the 
evidence it already knew.  Thus, it was error t o exclude the 
evidence based on failure to comply with HRE Rule 412 procedural 
notice requirements.   
4. West must be clarified  
 Minor also challenges (1) the family court’s post -trial 
determination that it had properly excluded the evidence because 
Minor had failed to establish falsity as required by West; and 
(2) the ICA’s ruling the family court could make that finding 
even though the family court had not made a preliminary 
determination as to falsity.  
As discussed, West initially recognized that false 
allegations of unrelated sexual assaults are not excluded by HRE 
Rule 412.   See 95 Hawaiʻi at 457-58, 24 P.3d at 6 53-54.  Yet, in 
addition to requiring compliance with HRE Rule 412 procedural 
requirements, West held that “where a defendant seeks to admit 
allegedly false statements made by a complainant regarding an 
unrelated sexual assault, the trial court must make a 
preliminary determination based on a preponderance of the ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
22   evidence that the statements are false.”  95 Hawaiʻi at 460, 24 
P.3d at 656.     
 This holding of West raises significant issues.  As 
recognized by Kelekolio  and initially in West, false allegations 
of sexual assault are not sexual conduct, which is the subject 
of HRE Rule 412.  West also implicates the constitutional rights 
of criminal d efendants.11  Additionally, as a practical matter, a 
trial court may not be able to ascertain whether a complaining 
witness’s allegations of sexual assault by others are true or 
false.  And even in a bench trial, as in this case, it can be 
error for the cou rt to reject evidence which, if admitted, would 
present an essential factual issue for itself as the trier of 
fact.  See Abion, 148 Hawaiʻi at 448, 478 P.3d at 273.   
                                                 
11  Such rights include rights to confrontation, cross -examination, and to 
present a complete defense, which also apply to minors in juvenile 
proceedings.  For example, we have noted:  
 
HRE 412 cannot override the constitutional rig hts of the 
accused.  Under  sections 5  and 14 of Article I  of our State 
Constitution, appellant’s right of confrontation includes a 
right to appropriate cross -examination of the complaining 
witness. 
  
State v. Calbero , 71 Haw. 115, 12 4, 785 P.2d 157, 161 (1989).  
 
 For adults, the constitutional right to a jury trial may also be 
implicated.   For example, we have stated :  
 
The rule requiring the submission of factual determinations 
to the jury if there is any evidence upon which the jury 
may act is based on the principle that credibility of 
witnesses and weight of the evidence are for the jury to 
decide.  The court should not invade the  jury’s province of 
making factual determinations . 
 
State v. Riveira, 59 Haw. 148, 154, 577 P.2d 793, 797 (1978)  (citation 
omitted) . ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
23  This case is an example of the difficulty of applying West.  
We therefore revisit and cl arify West as follows:  If a 
defendant seeks to admit a complaining witness’s false 
allegations of sexual assault, then admissibility is not subject 
to HRE Rule 412 or West.  Defendants seeking to admit such 
evidence must make it clear the evidence is bein g proffered for 
its falsity.  We do not address the applicability of other rules 
of evidence, including HRE Rule 403  (2016).12  A court must also, 
however, consider the constitutional rights of the defendant.13   
 When a defendant seeks to admit evidence of sexual assault 
allegations based on their truth or where truth or falsity is 
unclear, the admission of such evidence is subject to HRE Rule 
412.  However, we abrogate West’s requirement that the trial 
court make a preliminary determination based on a prepo nderance 
of the evidence that the statements are false before allowing 
admission.  For such evidence, HRE Rule 412 explicitly requires 
compliance with HRE Rule 412(c) procedural requirements as well 
as consideration of a defendant’s constitutional rights.  See 
HRE Rule 412(b)(1).   HRE Rule 403 considerations also come into 
                                                 
12  HRE Rule 403 provides , “Although relevant, evidence may be 
excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the 
danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the 
jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless 
presentation of cumulative evidence. ”  
 
13  See supra note 11. ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
24   play, but are also subject to a defendant’s constitutional 
rights.  
 If any evidence of a complaining witness’s allegations of 
sexual assault by others is admitted in jury trials, the cou rt 
should give appropriate limiting instructions.  
 In this case, Minor proffered extrinsic evidence that CW 
had made false statements of sexual assault against others.  For 
the reasons explained above, we hold that this evidence was not 
subject to HRE Rule  412 or West.14  The exclusion of the evidence 
proffered in this case was not harmless beyond a reasonable 
doubt.  Minor’s adjudication as a law violator must therefore be 
vacated.  
C. The insufficient evidence argument is without merit  
 Finally, in a concl usory fashion, Minor asserts that there 
was insufficient evidence for the family court to adjudicate him 
a law violator.  Appellate challenges to the sufficiency of 
evidence must always be decided.  State v. Davis , 133 Hawaiʻi 
102, 116, 324 P.3d 912, 926 (2014).  
 Viewing the record in the light most favorable to the 
State, there was sufficient evidence to support the family 
                                                 
14  The foundational requirements of HRE Rule 613(b) had been met.  See 
supra note 8.  The issue of whether any of the proffered evidence could or 
should have been excluded based on HRE Rule 403, consistent with Minor’s 
constitutional rights, is not before us.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
25 court’s adjudication of Minor as a law violator on Counts 1,2, 
and 4.  This argument on certiorari is d evoid of merit.  
V.Conclusion
 Hence, w e vacate the ICA ’s October 30, 2020 judgment on 
appeal as well as the family court ’s June 5, 2019 decree, July 
23, 2019 order, and September 24, 2019 findings of fact and 
conclusions of law.  We remand to the family  court for 
proceedings consistent with this opinion.
