 1 (“CW1”).1  Count 2 charged Milne with third degree assault in 
violation of HRS § 707 -712(1)(a)  (2014) against Complaining 
Witness 2 ( “CW2”).2  
 The family court  granted Milne ’s oral motion to dismiss 
Count 2, concluding it lacked subject matter jurisdiction  over 
that count .  On appeal, the I ntermediate Court of Appeals 
(“ICA”) concluded the family court erred in dismissing Count 2 
because the family court had concurrent subject matter 
jurisdiction over the charge based  on HRS § 571-14(b) (2014).  
The ICA ordered that Count 2 be remanded to the family court for 
further proceedings consistent with its memor andum opinion.  
 On certiorari, Milne concedes that the family court had 
concurrent jurisdiction over Count 2 .  Milne  argues, however,  
that the family court did not dismiss Count 2 based on a lack of 
subject matter jurisdiction .  He maintains the family cou rt had 
                         
1  HRS § 709 -906 states in relevant part:  
 
(1) It shall be unlawful for any person, singly or in 
concert, to physically abuse a family or household member 
or to refuse compliance with the lawful order of a police 
officer under subsection (4).   The police, in investigating 
any complaint of abuse of a family or household member, 
upon request, may transport the abused person to a hospital 
or safe shelter.  
  
 . . . . 
 
(5) Abuse of a family or household member and refusal to 
comply with the lawful order of a police officer under  
subsection (4) are misdemeanors[.]  
 
2  HRS § 707 -712(1)(a) states in relevant part: “ (1) A person commits the 
offense of assault in the third degree if the person: (a) Intentionally, 
knowingly, or recklessly causes bodily injury to another person[.]”  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 discretion to decline the  exercise  of its concurrent 
jurisdiction  over Count 2 . 
 For the reasons explained below, we hold as follows:   
(1) the ICA was correct in ruling that the family court 
dismissed Count 2 for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and 
erred by doing so, as HRS § 571 -14(b) provided the family court  
with concurrent subject matter jurisdiction over Count 2;  and  
(2) the family court continues to have subject matter 
jurisdiction over Coun t 2 despite the di smissal of Count 1 with 
prejudice , and it is for the family court to address Count 2 on 
remand. 
II. Background  
A. Factual and p rocedural background  
 1. Family court proceedings    
 On June 18, 2019, Milne was charged in the family court via 
complaint for events allegedly occurring on June 16, 2019, as 
follows: (1) Count 1, with respect to CW1, his girlfriend, abuse 
of family or household members  in violation of  HRS § 709 -906(1) 
and (5); and (2) Count 2, with respect to CW2, CW1’s father, 
third degree assault  in violation of HRS § 707 -712(1)(a).   
 At a trial  call on July 22, 2019 , the State requested a 
continuance because the complaining witnesses  were not present  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
4 
 despite being subpoenaed .  The family court3 orally granted the 
continuance over Milne’s objection.  Milne then orally moved to 
dismiss Count 2 for lack of subject matter jurisdiction , 
asserting that the family court lacked subject matter 
jurisdiction because although CW1  was Milne’s girlfriend, CW2, 
CW1’s father, did not live or reside in the same household as 
Milne.  The State requested that the defense submit a written 
motion so it could appropriately respond, but the family court 
asked the State to “take a look at 571 -14”: 
THE COURT:  Can you take a look at 571 -14, counsel? . . . . 
 
. . . . 
 
THE COURT:  So look at subsection []( (b),[4] counsel.  
[Deputy prosecuting attorney (“D PA”)]:  And, your honor, 
under section [](b) the –- the court would have concurrent 
jurisdiction over the Assault Third given the –- it’d be 
one of the off enses in this case would be under the 
jurisdiction of Family Court, which would be the Count 1.  
THE COURT:  [D eputy public defender (“DPD”) ], your respon se 
to that, under subsection [] (b)? 
[DPD]:  Your honor, and my response to t hat is that under 
subsectio n [](b) is that that’s if it was as to pertaining 
to the same complaining witness.  However, in this matter 
the two different counts are represented by offenses, again 
two different complaining witnesses.  Therefore the court 
does not have jurisdiction ove r Count 2 relating to the 
second complaining witness.  
THE COURT:  And where do you get the limiting language that 
it has to relate to the same complaining witness?  
[DPD]:  Your honor, that –- I don’t –- there is no limiting 
language but that is the defense ’s argument.   
                         
3  Unless otherwise indicated, the Honorable Kevin A. Souza presided.  
 
4  HRS § 571 -14(b) provides:  
 
(b) The court shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the 
district court over violations of sections 707 -712, 707 -
717, 707 -722, 708 -822, 708 -823, 710 -1010.5, 711-1106, and 
711-1106.5 when multiple offenses are charged through 
complaint or indictment and at least one offense is a 
violation of an order issued pursuant to chapter 586 or a 
violation of section 709 -906. ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
5 
 THE COURT:   [DPA]? 
[DPA]:  And, your honor, as the court stated there is no 
limiting language under 571-14[](b) as to limit or to 
distinguish that it had to be the same complaining witness.  
Just that one of the offenses charged through the complaint 
would be pursuant to chapter 586 (indiscernible).   
THE COURT:  All right.  And the complaining witness in 
Count 2, again, the representation of the defense is that 
the complaining witness is girlfriend’s father?  
[DPA]:  That’s correct.  That’s a ccurate.  
 
 The family court then orally granted Milne ’s motion, 
stating: 
THE COURT:   All right.  The court reads 571 -14 as 
permissive and not mandatory as to section (b), and because 
the complaining witness in Count 2 is not a family or 
household member to Mr. Milne, the court is, based on the 
representations of counsel, going to be dismi ssing Count 2 
without prejudice and the State would be free to refile 
Count 2 in District Court as to that complaining witness.  
All right?  
 
 The family court filed its written order dismissing  Count 2 
on July 26, 20 19 (“dismissal order”) , which stated in relevant 
part: 
 After consideration of the arguments of counsels, 
this Court granted the Defendant’s oral motion to dismiss 
Count II for lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction, and it is 
further ordered that Count II be dismissed without 
prejudice.  
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Defendant’s Oral Motion 
to dismiss Count II is GRANTED.  Furthermore, Count II is 
dismissed without prejudice for lack of Subject Matter 
Jurisdiction.  
 
 The State appealed the Count 2 dismissal order to the ICA 
on August 23, 2019 .  At a September 16, 2019  trial call , CW1 and 
two other civilian witnesses , who were subpoenaed, failed to 
appear in court.  The State orally requested another 
continuance .  Milne objected and orally moved to dismiss Count 1 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
6 (continued . . .)  
 with prejudice.  The family court5 denied the request for a 
continuance and granted Milne’s oral  motion to dismiss Count 1 
with prejudice .  
 Then, on November 22, 2019, the family court entered 
findings of fact and conclusions of law ( “11/22/19 FOFs/COLs ”). 
In its 11/22/19 FOFs/COLs,  the family court maintained that even 
if it had jurisdiction over Count 2, the dismissal of Count 1 
with prejudice rendered the State’s appeal moot.  It also opined 
that even if the State’s appeal was successful, Count 2 should 
no longer be prosecuted in the family court, as it was not 
coupled with an offense over which the family court had 
exclusive, original jurisdiction.  The family court also posited 
that the State’s only option going forward was to proceed with 
Count 2 in the district court, as it had  ordered in the 
dismissal order.  It also maintained that any other outcome 
“would lead to the tortuous result of the Family Court being 
forced to proceed to trial on a single charge (Assault 3) over 
which it does not have exclusive, original jurisdiction – and 
between two parties who are not family or household members.”   
The family court contended  that the State’s ongoing practice of 
using HRS § 571 -14(b) to “bootstrap” additional cases involving 
non-family members threatened to transform the family court from

call. ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 a court of limited jurisdiction into one of general 
jurisdiction.6   
 2. ICA proceedings  
 On appeal to the ICA, in summary, the State argue d that the 
family court erred as a matter of law by dismissing Count 2 for 
lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  In response, Milne 
conceded the family court had concurrent jurisdiction over Count 
2, but also asserted  it was only as long as Count 1 was pending.  
Milne also contended  the family court’s decision to decline 
jurisdiction should be reviewed under the abuse of discretion 
standard, citing to NB v. GA , 133 Hawaiʻi 436, 329 P.3d 341 (App. 
                         
6  The ICA did not address the merits of the family court ’s 11/22/19 
FOFs/COLs on the grounds the family court lacked jurisdiction to enter them.   
State v. Milne, CAAP-19-0000594, 2020 WL 6375352 (App . Oct. 30, 2020) (mem .), 
at 7.  The ICA noted that when an adult is charged with a crime, the Hawaiʻi 
Rules of Penal Procedure (“HRPP”) govern.  Milne, mem. op. at 7 n.9 (citing 
State v. Gonsales , 91 Hawaiʻi 446, 449, 984 P.2d 1272, 1275 (1999) ; Hawaiʻi 
Family Court Rules  (“HFCR”) Rule 81(c) (2015) (“Cases for adults charged with 
the commission of a crime coming within the jurisdiction of the family courts 
shall be governed by the [HRPP].”)).  The ICA cited to HRPP Rule 23(c) , which 
provides for a court to make findings “[ i]n a case tried without a jury” and 
if requested, to make special findings “at any time prior to sentence.”  Id.  
The ICA ruled HRPP Rule 23(c) did not authorize the 11/22/19 FOF s/COLs 
relating to the dismissal order; in short, the ICA concluded the famil y court 
did not have jurisdiction to enter the 11/22/19 FOF s/COLs related to the 
dismissal ord er, citing to HRPP Rule 23(c).  Id.  HRPP Rule 23(c), however, 
is part of the rule entitled “Trial by Jury or by the Court,” and does not 
govern.  Rather, as our family courts are a division of our circuit courts, 
see HRS § 571 -3 (2006) (“The family courts shall be divisions of the circuit 
courts of the State and shall not be deemed to be other courts as that term 
is used in the State Constitution.”), HRPP Rule 44A (a) (2011), pertaining to 
“Settlement of Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order; Entry of 
Order” in the circuit courts, governs here.  There has been no separate 
appeal of the 11/22/19 FOFs/COLs, and, as the  ICA noted, none of the ICA 
briefs, all of which were filed after the 11/22/19 FOF s/COLs, mention the 
11/22/19 FOFs/COLs .  Id.  We address the 11/22/19 FOFs/COLs later in this 
opinion.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 2014).7  Milne asserted the family court had actually properly 
exercised its discretion to dismiss Count 2.  
 In its October 30, 2020  amended memorandum opinion , the ICA 
vacated the dismissal order , holding the family court erred by 
dismissing Count 2 for lack of s ubject matter jurisdiction.   
Milne, mem. op. at 6, 8.  The ICA  noted Milne now appropriately 
conceded on appeal that the family court “had concurrent subject 
matter jurisdiction over Count 2 as long as Count 1 was 
pending. ”  Milne, mem. op. at 5.   The ICA explained that under 
the plain language of HRS § 571 -14(b), the family court has 
concurrent jurisdiction  with the district court over violations 
of specific offenses, including HRS § 707 -712 (third degree 
assault), when multiple offenses are charged in a c omplaint or 
indictment and at least one offense is, inter alia, a violation 
of HRS § 709 -906 (abuse of family or household members).  Id.  
The ICA reasoned that even if there was an ambiguity as to 
whether HRS § 571 -14(b) limits charges of multiple offense s to 
                         
7  This case stated in relevant part:  
 
A family court’s decision to decline jurisdiction is 
reviewed for abuse of discretion.  See Fisher v. Fisher , 
111 Hawaiʻi 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006) (“‘[An 
appellate court] will not disturb the family court’s 
decisions on appeal unless the family court disregarded 
rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial 
detriment of a party litigant and its decision c learly 
exceeded the bounds of reason.’” (quoting In re Doe , 95 
Hawaiʻi 183, 189 –90, 20 P.3d 616, 622 –23 (2001))).

 the same complaining witness, its legislative history reflected 
otherwise.  Id.; see Milne, mem. op. at 5 -6; S. Stand. Comm. 
Rep. No. 2649, in 1998 Senate Journal, at 1071 (“For example, if 
a person assaults another individual while violating a family  
court restraining order, under current law the [] two violations 
of law would be heard in separate courts.  Your Committee 
further finds that concurrent jurisdiction will make the 
judicial process in these instances more efficient and 
effective.”).   The ICA stated Act 64 of 1998, which added 
subsection (b) to HRS § 571 -14, also showed the legislature 
intended to provide for concurrent jurisdiction, even when the 
multiple charged offenses involved different complaining 
witnesses.  Milne, mem. op. at 5 -6.8    
 The ICA noted  Milne made speculative arguments on appeal as 
to why the family court allegedly decided not to exercise its 
concurrent jurisdiction, based on his assertion of different 
                         
8  The ICA also cited another committee report in support:  
 
 Your Committee finds that one inciden t can give rise 
to several different charges.   Some of these charges, like 
a violation of a family court restraining order or 
misdemeanor abuse of family and household member, fall 
under the jurisdiction of the family court, while others 
may fall under the  jurisdiction of the circuit or district 
courts.  Current law prevents the State from bringing all 
the related charges at one time before one court.  
 This bill addresses that problem by giving the 
circuit, district, and family courts concurrent 
jurisdictio ns over certain offenses[.]  
 
Milne, mem. op. at 6 n.8 (quoting H. Stand. Comm. Rep.  No. 1055 -98, in 1998 
House Journal, at 1 482).   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 scenarios that could occur an d purported inferences that had  no 
basis on the record.  Id.   
 The ICA filed its judgment on appeal on November 12 , 2020, 
remanding the case to the family court for further  proceedings 
consistent with its amended memorandum opinion.   
 3. Supreme court certiorari application  
 On certiorari , Milne presents the following question:  
“Whether the ICA committed grave error in concluding that the 
Family Court had jurisdiction over Count 2.”  Milne repeats his 
arguments  made to the ICA.   The State did not respond.  
III. Standards of review  
A. Statutor y interpretation  
 Statutory interpretation is a question of law 
reviewable de novo.  In reviewing questions of statutory 
interpretation, we are guided by the following principles:  
 
 First, the fundamental starting point for 
statutory -interpretation is the language of the 
statute itself.   Second, where the statutory language 
is plain and unambiguous, our sole duty is to give 
effect to its plain and obvious meaning.  Third, 
implicit in the task of statutory construction is our 
foremost obligation to ascertain  and give effect to 
the intention of the legislature, which is to be 
obtained primarily from the language contained in the 
statute itself.  Fourth, when there is doubt, 
doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness or 
uncertainty of an expression used in a s tatute, an 
ambiguity exists.

 B. Subject matter jurisdiction  
 “Whether a court possesses subject matter jurisdiction is a 
question of law reviewable de novo.”  Kakinami v. Kakinami , 127 
Hawaiʻi 126, 136, 276 P.3d 695, 705 (2012).  
IV. Discussion  
A. The ICA was correct in ruling that the family court 
dismissed Count 2 for lack of subject matter jurisdiction 
and erred by doing so, as HRS § 571 -14(b) provided the 
family court  with concurrent subject m atter jurisdiction 
over Count 2  
 
 At the ICA and again at this court, Milne concedes that the 
family court had concurrent jurisdiction over Count 2 based on 
HRS § 571 -14(b).  The ICA correctly held that the family court 
had concurrent jurisdiction over Count 2.   HRS § 571 -14(b) 
states:  
§ 571-14.  Jurisdiction; adults  
 
 . . . . 
 
(b) The court shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the 
district court over violations of sections 707 -712, 707 -
717, 707 -722, 708 -822, 708 -823, 710 -1010.5, 711 -1106, and 
711-1106.5 when multiple offenses are charged through 
complaint or indictment and at least one offense is a 
violation of an order issued pursuant to chapter 586 or a 
violation of section 709 -906. 
 
 The plain language of HRS § 571 -14(b) provides the family 
court with “concurrent jurisdiction with the district court over 
violations of section[] 707 -712[] . . . when multiple offenses 
are charged through complaint” and “at least one offense is a 
violatio n . . . of section 709 -906.”  Here, Milne was charged 
via complaint with a violation of HRS § 709 -906 in Count 1.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
12 
 Thus, based on the plain language of the statute, the family 
court had concurrent jurisdiction with the district court over 
Count 2 charging a violation of HRS 707-712. 
 Because the plain language of HRS § 571 -14(b) is 
unambiguous, we need not turn to the next step of statutory 
interpretation, which is to ascertain and give effect to the 
intent of the legislature.  But as the ICA explained, even if 
the statute was ambiguous, the legislative history of         
HRS § 571 -14(b) confirms legislat ive intent to provide for 
concurrent jurisdiction  when charged offenses involved different 
individuals.  See Milne, mem. op. at 5 -6.  
 Milne repeats his argument , however, that based on oral 
statements  made before its ruling , the family court did not 
actually dismiss Count 2 based on a lack of subject matter 
jurisdiction.  Milne asserts the family court acknowledged it 
had concurr ent subject matter jurisdi ction but exercise d 
discretion to decline concurrent subject matter jurisdiction.  
 Milne’s assertions are devoid of merit.  The family court 
expressly stated it was dismissing Count 2 because the 
complaining witness was not the same person as that for the 
abuse charge  in Count 1 .  Also, as the ICA noted, Milne makes 
speculative arguments  with no basis in the record as to why the 
family court allegedly decided not to exerc ise its concur rent ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
13 
 jurisdiction .  But Milne ’s argument is problematic for 
additional  reasons.  
 First, Milne suggests the family court had discretion to 
dismiss the concurrent charge and require that it be refiled in 
district court.  Subject matter jurisdiction , however,  is a 
matter of law, not a matter of discretion.  Pursuant to article 
VI, section 1 of the  Hawaiʻi Constitution , our state courts “have 
original and appellate jurisdiction as provided by law[.] ”  
Through HRS § 571 -14(b), the legislature provided our family 
courts with concurrent jurisdiction over certain matters.     
HRS § 571 -8.5(a)(3)  (2018) provides that a family court judge 
may “[m]ake and issue all orders and writs necessary or 
appropriate in aid of  their original juri sdiction. ”  (Emphasis 
added.)  And, in general,  “[i]t is a judge ’s duty to decide all 
cases within [the judge ’s] jurisdiction that are brought before 
[the judge. ]”  Pierson v. Ray , 386 U.S. 547, 554 (1967)  
(emphasis added).9  
 Second, contrary t o Milne’s assertion  that the family court  
exercised discretion to dismiss  Count 2, the family court 
expressly  stated in its  dismissal order that it dismissed Count 
2 for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  As explained, t his 
written ruling was actually consistent with the family court ’s 
                         
9  See infra note 11 for an exception to the general rule.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
14 (continued . . .)  
 oral ruling.   But even if the written order had been 
inconsistent with the oral ruling, as t he ICA has rep eatedly 
stated, a trial court ’s written order co ntrols over its oral 
statements.10  On this point, w e agree with authority cited by 
the ICA in its rulings that a judge’s written order generally 
controls over its oral statements.   See Nat’l Home Centers, Inc. 
v. Coleman , 257 S.W.3d 862, 863 (Ark.  2007) (“If a trial court ’s 
ruling from the bench is not reduced to writing and filed of 
record, it is free to alter its decision upon further 
consideration of the matter.   Simply put, the written order 
controls .” (cleaned up) ); Owens v. Magill , 419 S.E.2d 786 , 791 
(S.C. 1992) (holding that a judge was not bound by prior oral 
ruling and could issue written order which conflicted with prior 
oral ruling);  Ladd by Ladd v. Honda Motor Co., Ltd. , 939 S.W.2 d 
83, 104 (Tenn.  Ct. App. 1996) (“A court speaks only through its 
written orders .”); Ratcliff v. Cyrus , 544 S.E.2d 93, 96 n.14 
(Va. 2001) (“[W]hen presented with conflicting signals from a 
circuit court, the law favors written orders over oral 
statements.”).   
                         
10  See, e.g., State v. Zhang , CAAP-19-0000338, 2020 WL 733971, at  *3 (App. 
Feb. 13, 2020) (SDO) (“The written order controls over the oral statements 
the District Court made at the March 13, 2019 hearing.” ( citing Kono v. 
Abercrombie , CAAP-11-0000755, 2013 WL 1758960, at *4 (App . Apr. 24, 2013) 
(mem.)).  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

  The family court’s written order expressly dismissed  Count 
2 for an alleged lack of subject matter jurisdiction ; this order 
controls .  For this reason also, w e reject Milne ’s argument that 
the family court declined to exercise  concurrent jurisdiction 
based on other considerations .11 
 Hence , the ICA correctly ruled that the family court 
dismissed Count 2 for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and 
erred by doing so. 
B. The family court continues to have subject matter 
 jurisdiction over Count 2 despite the dismissal of Count 1 
 with prejudice , and it is for the family court to address 
 Count 2 on remand 
 
 In its amended memorandum opinion, the ICA indicated Milne 
had properly c onceded on appeal that the family court “had 
concurrent subject matter jurisdiction over Count 2 as long as 
Count 1 was pending .”  Milne, mem. op. at 5 (emphasis added) .  
The ICA’s judgment on appeal then remanded  Count 2 to the family 
court for further  proceedings consistent with its memorandum 
opinion.   
                         
11  Also, as the ICA reasoned , NB, the case Milne cites in support of his 
argument that the abuse of discretion standard  of review applies , is 
distinguishable.  In NB, the ICA vacated the family court’s decision to 
decline jurisdiction based on its lack of findings on the  statutory factors 
to determine whether Hawaiʻi was an inconvenient forum pursuant to          
HRS § 583A -207 (2016), which read s in relevant part: “A court of this State 
which has jurisdiction under this chapter to make a child -custody 
determination may d ecline to exercise its jurisdiction at any time if it 
determines that it is an inconvenient forum under the circumstances and that 
a court of another state is a more appropriate forum.”  133 Hawaiʻi at 443-44, 
329 P.3d at 348 -49.  Here, not only did the family court’s written dismissal 
order state  it dismissed Count 2 for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,  
HRS § 571 -14(b) does not give the family court discretion to decline 
jurisdiction, unlike the statute at issue in NB.   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

  As noted, how ever, after the State ’s August 23, 2019 notice 
of appeal to the ICA of the Count 2 dismissal order, the family 
court granted Milne’s motion to dismiss Count 1 with prejudic e.  
It is unclear whether the ICA agreed with Milne’s concession on 
appeal that the family court had concurrent subject matter 
jurisdiction over Count 2 as long as Count 1 was pending , and 
Count 1 is no longer pending.   
 Also after the notice of appeal, the family court entered 
its 11/22/19 FOFs/COLs stating its apparent positions with 
respect to Count 2.  Based on the importance of the issues 
presented in the 11/22/19 FOFs/COLs, pursuant to our supervisory 
powers under HRS § 602-4 (2016),12 we provide guidance to the 
family court on remand.    
 First, in its 11/22/19 FOFs/COLs, the family court 
maintained that even assuming it had jurisdiction over Count 2, 
the dismissal of Count 1 with prejudice ren dered the State’s 
appeal moot.   It can be inferred from this that the family court 
is under the impression  that its subject matter jurisdiction 
over Count 2 disappeared with the dismissal of Count 1.   The 
family court ’s concurrent subject matt er jurisdiction over Count 
2 did not disappear , however,  when Count 1 was dismissed.   
                         
12  HRS § 602 -4 provides, “ Superintendence of inferior courts.   The supreme 
court shall have the general superintendence of all courts of inferior 
jurisdiction to prevent and correct errors and abuses therein where no other 
remedy is expressly provided by law.”  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
17 
  Under HRS § 571-14(b), the family court ’s concurrent 
subject matter jurisdiction over Count 2 was invoked when 
assault was charged along with the HRS § 709-906 abuse charge in 
Count 1.  See HRS § 571 -14(b) (“The court shall have concurrent 
jurisdiction with the district court over [a] violation [] of 
section[] 707-712 . . . when multiple offenses are charged 
through complaint [] and at least one offense i s . . . a 
violation of section 709 -906.” (emphasis added) ).             
HRS § 571-14(b) does not require the abuse  or restraining order 
charge continue  to be pending for subject matter jurisdiction to 
continue over a concurrent charge.  Nothing in the  legislative 
history of Act 64 of 1998  indicates the legislature so intended , 
and such a result would be absurd.   If subject matter 
jurisdiction over a concurrent charge disappear s upon dismissal 
of the abuse or restraining order charge, double jeopardy issues  
would arise  for the concurrent charge if a judge dismisses the 
abuse or restraining order charge after commencement of trial.  
In addition, i f dismissal of or judgment upon a plea to an  abuse 
or restraining order charge eliminated family court jurisdictio n 
over a concurrent charge, statute of limitations issues could 
arise for refiling in distric t court.  In summary, despite the ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
18 (continued . . .)  
 family court ’s dismissal of Count 1, its subject matter 
jurisdiction over Count 2 continues.13 
 Second, the family court indicated that if the State’s 
appeal was successful, Count 2 should no longer be prosecute d in 
the family court, as it would no longer be  coupled with an 
offense over which the family court had “exclusive, ” original 
jurisdiction.  Contrary to the family co urt’s statement, after 
Act 64 of 1998, the family court no  longer has  “exclusive” 
original juris diction over HRS § 709 -906 charges  in certain 
circumstances, such as those here .  Act 64 of 1998 amended    
HRS § 571 -14 to add the underlined language:  
(a)  Except as provided in sections 603 -21.5 and 604 -8, the 
court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction:  
     (1)  To try any offense committed against a child by the 
child’s parent or guardian or by any other person having the 
child’s legal or physical custody, and any violation of 
section 707 -726, 707 -727, 709 -902, 709 -903, 709 -903.5,    
709-904, 709 -905, 709 -906, or 302A -1135, whether or not 
included in other provisions of this paragraph or paragraph 
(2)[.] 
1998 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 64, § 1 at 143 .  The amendment s to HRS 
§§ 603-21.5 and 604-8 reciprocally provided the circuit and 
district courts with concurrent jurisdiction with the family 
courts over crimes over which the family courts previously had 
                         
13  Also, even if the dismissal of Count 1 had rendered the appeal of the 
Count 2 dismissal moot, exceptions to the mootness doctrine would most likely 
have applied.  See State v. Tui , 138 Hawaiʻi 462, 46 7-68, 382 P.3d 274, 27 9-80 
(2016). ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
19 
 exclusive original jurisdiction , when concurrently ch arged with 
certain crimes in those courts.14  
 Third, the family also stated in its 11/2 2/19 FOFs/COL s 
that the State’s only option going forward was to proceed with 
Count 2 in the district court, as it had o rdered in the 
dismissal order.  The legislature , however, promulgated Act 64 
of 1998 to further judicial efficiency.  See S. Stand. Comm. 
Rep. No. 2649, in 1998 Senate Journal, at 1071 (“Your Committee 
                         
14  In relevant part, Act 64 of 1998 a mended HRS § 603 -21.5 to add the 
underlined language : 
 
(b)  The several circuit courts shall have concurrent 
jurisdiction with the family court over:  
 
(1)  Any felony under section 571 -14, violation of an 
order issued pursuant to chapter 586, or a violation 
of section 709 -906 when multiple offenses are charged 
through complaint or indictment and at least one 
other offense is a criminal offense under subsection 
(a)(1); and  
(2)  Any felony under section 571 -14 when multiple 
offenses are charged through complaint or indictment 
and at least one other offense is a violation of an 
order issued pursuant to chapter 586, a violation of 
section 709 -906, or a misdemeanor under the 
jurisdiction of section 604 -8. 
 
1998 Haw. S ess. Laws Act 64, § 1 at 143 -44.   
 
 In relevant part, Act 64 of 1998 a mended HRS § 604 -8 to add the 
underlined language : 
 
(b)  The district court shall have concurrent jurisdiction 
with the family court of any violation of an order issued 
pursuant to chapter 586 or any violation of section 709 -906 
when multiple offenses are charged through complaint or 
indictment and at least one other offense is a criminal 
offense within the jurisdiction of the district courts.  
 
1998 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 64, § 3 at 144 .   
 
 The ICA erred to the extent that it stated the circuit court did not 
get concurrent jurisdiction over the specified offenses in the family and 
district courts.  See Milne, mem. op. at 6 n.8.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 further finds that concurrent jurisdiction will make the 
judicial process [] more efficient and effecti ve.”).  Requiring 
Count 2 to be refiled in district c ourt is not only inefficient, 
but as noted, a court has a duty to decide all cases within its 
jurisdiction that are brought before it.  
 Fourth, a ccording  to the family court, any outcome other 
than requiring that Count 2 be dismissed then refiled in the 
district court  “would lead to the tortuous result of the Family 
Court being forced to proceed to trial on a single charge 
(Assault 3) over which it does not have exclusive, original 
jurisdiction – and between two parties who are not family or 
household members.”  The family court objects to the State’s 
reliance on  HRS § 571 -14(b) to allegedly “bootstrap” additional 
cases involving non -family members, which it apparently believes 
threatens t o transform the family court from a court of limited 
jurisdiction into a court of general jurisdiction.   
 Contrary to the family court ’s statements , however, it is 
appropriate for our family courts to address various charges 
arising out of the same domestic violence  event, even if the 
complaining witness is not a family or  household member or 
petitioner.   Family court judges are knowledgeable about and 
receive specialized training on various issues and concerns 
arising out of domestic violence.  In additio n, Act 64 of 1998, 
of which the amendment to HRS § 571 -14(b) is  only a part, ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
21 (continued . . .)  
 greatly improved inefficiencies and redundancies that previously 
existed for prosecutors, defendants, witnesses, and the courts .  
Before Act 64 of 1998, there were many situations  in which 
charges involving  different victims in the same domestic 
violence event had to be filed se parately in circuit, family, or  
district courts due to their respective  jurisdicti onal 
limitations .  This meant that differ ent prosecutors and courts 
would be required to address the same event, while defendants, 
complaining witnesses, and other eyewitnesses,15 including law 
enforcement, c ould be subpoenaed to appear in different courts 
on different days for charges arising out of  the same event.   
Due to the confusing nature of the charges and courts, and due 
to impracticalities, some charges we re therefore dismissed and 
some possible charges were never brought.  And contrary to the 
family court ’s apparent  belief that Act 64 of 199 8 only requires  
the family court to address additional charges over which it 
previously lacked jurisdiction, Act 64 of 1998 also allowed 
criminal charges that were previously required to be brought in 
family court to be brought in circu it and district  courts.16  
This means that the  circuit and district  courts also now preside 
                         
15  The “complaining witness” in one court could become an “ eyewitness” in 
another court.

 over charges that previously would have been handled by the 
family courts.17 
 Therefore, under the circumstances of this case, it is for 
the family court to address Count 2 upon remand.18 
V. Conclusion  
  For the reasons stated above, t he ICA’s judgment on appeal 
is affirmed , as clarified  by this opinion.

17     For example, t he ICA previously ruled in State v. Dela Cruz , CAAP-11-
0000367,  2013 WL 275547 , at *1 (App. Jan. 24, 2013 ) (SDO), that the district 
court erred by dismissing a HRS § 709 -906 charge  over which the district 
court had concurrent jurisdiction pursuant to HRS § 604 -8(b).  This court 
accepted certiorari only to address the ICA’s reliance on the plain error 
doctrine in making this ruling; we determined that the State had preserved 
the error by timely appealing the dismissal.  State v. Dela Cruz , SCWC-11-
0000367, 2014 WL 78314 8, at *2 (Haw. Feb. 27, 2014) (mem.) .  The ICA’s 
substantive ruling regarding the district court’s error in dismissing the 
abuse charge for lack of subject matter jurisdiction was affirmed.  Id. 
 
18  We cannot envision all possibilities, and we therefore do  not intend to 
foreclose all possibility of a family court dismissing a concurrent count.  
We merely rule that it cannot do so for an alleged lack of subject matter 
jurisdiction or for the reasons stated in its 11/22/19 FOFs/COLs.
