RECKTENWALD, C.J., McKENNA, EDDINS, GINOZA, AND DEVENS, JJ.  
OPINION OF THE COURT BY GINOZA, J.  
I. INTRODUCTION 
The workers’ compensation law in Hawai‘i allows an 
employee to reopen a claim within eight years after the last  
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
payment of compensation . Specifically, Hawai‘i Revised Statutes 
(HRS) § 386-89(c) (2015) provides in relevant part: 
On the application of any party in interest, supported by a 
showing of substantial evidence, on the ground of a change 
in or of a mistake in a determination of fact related to 
the physical condition of the injured employee, the 
director may, at any time prior to eight years after date 
of the last payment of compensation, whether or not a decision awarding compensation has been issued, or at any 
time prior to eight years after the rejection of a claim, 
review a compensation case and issue a decision which may 
award, terminate, continue, reinstate, increase, or 
decrease compensation.  
(Emphasis added.) 
Petitioner -Claimant Richard Scott Webb ( Webb) 
submitted an application in 2017 to reopen his claim. 
Respondent -Employer OSF International, Inc. ( OSF) challenged 
Webb’s application because the last payment on Webb’s claim had 
been made twelve years before in 2005. The Director of the 
Department of Labor and Industrial Relations ( Director ), through 
the Disability Compensation Division ( DCD), denied Webb’s 
application to reopen his claim on grounds it was barred by the 
eight-year limit under HRS § 386-89(c). The Department of Labor 
and Industrial Relations Appeals Board ( LIRAB) affirmed the 
Director . However, the three -member LIRAB had differing views 
as to which party had the burden of proof on whether Webb’s 
application for reopening occur red within the required time 
period. The LIRAB majority stated claimant Webb had the burden 
of proof and failed to meet his burden. In a concurring 
opinion, the remaining LIRAB member expressed the view that the 
2  
 
 
  
 
  
 
    
    
 
  
  
 
  
 
  
   
     
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
eight-year period in HRS § 386-89(c) serves as a statute of 
limitations for which employer OSF had the burden of proof, and 
that OSF met its burden. 
Webb appealed the LIRAB decision to the Intermediate 
Court of Appeals ( ICA). The ICA affirmed the LIRAB and placed 
the burden of proof on Webb to support his application for 
reopening his claim under HRS § 386-89(c). 
We hold that the eight -year period in HRS § 386-89(c) 
for reopening a workers’ compensation claim sets out a statute 
of limitations . As such, the employer has the burden of proof 
if it asserts that a n application for reopening a claim is 
untimely under HRS § 386-89(c). 
In this case, we conclude that employer OSF met its 
burden of proof to show that Webb did not reopen his claim 
within the statutory eight -year period. We further conclude 
that Webb’s other challenges to the ICA’s Summary Disposition 
Order (SDO) are without merit. For the reasons set forth 
herein, we affirm the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal. 
II. BACKGROUND 
A. Work Injury and Stipulation 
On April 1, 1999, Webb sustained a work injury as a 
waiter at the Old Spaghetti Factory restaurant . On May 7, 2002, 
a stipulation and settlement agreement was entered between Webb, 
OSF, and OSF’s insurance carrier, Respondent -Insurance Carrier 
3  
 
 
  
  
 
 
    
  
 
 
    
  
  
 
  
 
  
     
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Hawaii Insurance Guaranty Association ( HIGA), which was approved 
by the Director through the DCD. The stipulation provided that, 
without prejudicing Webb’s “rights respecting reopening under 
[HRS] Chapter 386,” Webb “sustained an injury to his back and 
left hip out of an d in the course of his employment with [OSF], 
on or about 04/01/99 [;]” and t hat as a result of said injury , 
Webb “sustained permanent partial disability, to wit: 12% of the 
left lower extremity. ” The stipulation also provided for a lump 
sum payment of $17,936.64 for the permanent partial disability, 
and that OSF was to furnish Webb “so long as reasonably 
necessary, such medical care, services and supplies as the 
nature of the injury may require, pursuant to [HRS] Section [s] 
386-21 [(2015)] and 386-26 [(2015)][.] ”1 
B. 2003 DCD Proceedings 
On August 10, 2002, Dr. Coswin Saito, M.D. ( Dr. 
Saito), Webb’s physician at Kaiser Permanente, submitted a 
treatment plan with a diagnosis of “mechanical low back pain” 
for additional services and for acupuncture treatments. HIGA 
advised Dr. Saito that it was denying the acupuncture t reatment 
because it had not received a report indicating the need for 
further treatment from Dr. Saito since July 16, 2000 , and 
because Dr. Donald Maruyama (Dr. Maruyama ) had indicated tha t 
1 Webb does not argue, and thus we do not address, whether the 
stipulation affected application of the eight -year period under HRS § 386-
89(c). 
4  
 
 
   
   
  
  
   
 
     
 
    
   
  
 
  
     
    
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Webb’s back condition/strain had resolved and no further 
treatment was recommended. Webb contested HIGA ’s denial of Dr. 
Saito’s treatment plan and requested review by the DCD. 
On February 5, 2003, the DCD held a hearing to 
determine OSF’s liability for Dr. Saito ’s treatment plan . On 
March 12, 2003, the Director through DCD issued a decision (2003 
DCD Decision ) denying Dr. Saito ’s treatment plan because the low 
back condition was not due to the 1999 work injury. The 
Director credited concurring opinions by Dr. Porter Turnbull, 
Dr. Maruyama and Dr. Maurice Nicholson that Webb’s low back 
strain had resolved, and an MRI showing normal lumbar vertebral 
bodies and disc spaces. The Director found, however, that OSF 
was still liable for Webb ’s left leg/hip pain. The 2003 DCD 
Decision concluded: 
Pursuant to Sections 386 -21 and 386 -26, HRS, said employer 
shall pay for such medical care, services and supplies as 
the nature of the injury may require to the left hip, but 
not to include the low back.   [Dr. Saito’s treatment plan] 
request for acupuncture treatment with respect to 
mechanical low back pain beginning 7/2002 to 10/2002 is 
denied.   Dr. Saito is advised to resubmit a treatment plan 
request for acupuncture treatment with respect to [Webb ’s] 
diagnosis of a possible femoral neuropathy  pursuant to 
Sections 12 -15-32 and 12- 15-80 of the Workers ’  Compensation 
Medical Fee Schedule Administrative Rules.  
(Emphases added.) 
There was no appeal from the 2003 DCD Decision . 
C. Last Payment of Compensation in 2005 
On October 18, 2004, HIGA wrote to Dr. Saito 
requesting an updated report on Webb’s treatment, noting that 
5  
 
 
  
   
 
 
 
  
   
  
  
 
   
    
  
 
 
   
 
 
   
     
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
its records showed Webb was last seen on February 20, 2003. On 
November 5, 2004 , Dr. Saito responded to HIGA, stating that Webb 
was “evaluated in our clinic on November 5, 2004 [,]” “continues 
with left hip pain that is rated 5/10 on a 0 to 10 scale[,]” and 
“has been receiving ongoing treatment s involving acupuncture for 
pain relief to his left hip. ” Dr. Saito also stated that Webb 
“has been paying for these treatments on his own as he has been 
unable to get the [HIGA] to pay for treatments. He related to 
me a hearing with the Department of Labor in 2003 but was unable 
to get a ruling either in favor of or against him for ongoing 
acupuncture treatments. ” 
On June 24, 2005, OSF through HIGA made a payment via 
check in the amount of $139.49 to Kaiser Foundation Hospitals on 
behalf of Webb for medical services from November 5, 2004 to 
November 23, 2004. 
On December 28, 2005, HIGA filed a WC-3 Carrier ’s Case 
Report as a “Year End Report ” for 2005.2 The report noted a 
“Medical/Other Costs ” benefit payment of $139.49, and stated in 
the comments section that “no payments [were] made in 2004 .” 
2 HRS § 386-95 (2015) sets out requirements for employers to report 
work injuries to the Director, including that “[b]y January 31 of each year, 
the employer shall file with the director a report with respect to each 
injury on which the employer is continuing to pay compensati on, showing all 
amounts paid by the employer on account of the injury.” 
On December 27, 2004, HIGA filed a WC-3 Carrier ’s Case Report as a 
“Year End Report ” for 2004. The comments section for this report noted that 
“no payments [were] made in 2004[.] ” 
6  
 
 
     
   
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
On March 5, 2007, HIGA filed a WC-3 Carrier ’s Case 
Report (2007 WC-3 Report )  as a final report  for 2007 with a copy 
sent to Webb at his address.  The report  reflected the lump sum 
paid for permanent partial disability ($17,936.64) and the total 
payments made for medical/other costs ($8,175.68). The report 
further indicated  that Webb was last treated on November 23, 
2004.   Included at the bottom of the 2007 WC-3 Report  was a 
“Notice to Employee”  stating: “With the final payment of 
compensation (as indicated hereon) on your industrial injury of 
04/01/1999 identified as Case No. 29904705 the case shall be 
closed.   This determination shall not constitute a bar to your 
reopening rights as provided by Section 386-89, HRS, nor to future medical benefits.”  
D. Webb’s 2017 Application to Reopen His Case and DCD’s 2017 
Decision 
7   On April 26, 2017,  Dr. Joseph R. DiCostanzo, M.D. ( Dr. 
DiCostanzo) mailed a treatment plan request  for  additional 
services (DiCostanzo Treatment Plan ) for Webb to HIGA.   The 
DiCostanzo Treatment Plan included a diagnosis of: 1) “right 
knee joint pain > 3 months”; 2) “right shoulder joint pain > 3 
months”; 3) “right iliotibial  band syndrome”; and 4) “left hip 
injury[.]”   The services requested stated “Physician treatment 
beyond 120 days or 120 day collaborative care by covering KP MD, 
PA, or APRN[.]”   
 
 
   In a letter dated May 2, 2017, OSF/HIGA’s counsel 
advised  the DCD  that the DiCostanzo Treatment Plan  was denied,  
stating  that the denial was based in part on HRS §  386-89(c).  
  On May 18, 2017, Webb filed a WC-5 Employee’s Claim 
for Workers’  Compensation Benefits Form ( 2017 WC-5 Form ), which 
indicated that the reason for filing it was “[r]eopening of old 
claim.”   This form indicated Dr. DiCostanzo as the attending 
physician.   The 2017 WC-5 Form served as Webb’s application to 
reopen his workers’ compensation case. See  Hawai‘i  
Administrative Rules ( HAR) § 12-10-63  (eff. 1981).  
  
 
 
  
 
 
  
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
In response, OSF/HIGA asserted, among other things, 
that Webb’s attempt to reopen his 1999 claim was barred by HRS § 
386-89(c) and that Webb could not meet his burden of proof to 
show by substantial evidence a change in condition. 
A DCD hearing was held on September 6, 2017. On 
November 3, 2017, the Director through the DCD issued a decision 
(2017 DCD Decision ) addressing 1) whether Webb was “entitled to 
a reopening for further medical treatment ” and 2) whether Webb 
was “entitled to treatment pursuant to the treatment plan of 
[Dr. DiCostanzo], dated 4/26/2017[.] ” In its Findings of Fact, 
the Director stated that: 
[OSF’s] testimony and the final WC -3 for the year 
2005 indicates the last payment of a benefit on this claim 
was for medical benefits paid in the year 2005 in the 
amount of $139.49. 
Dr. DiCostanzo ’s treatment plan dated 4/26/2017 
indicates treatment was being requested for right knee 
8  
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
    
      
 
      
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
joint pain, right shoulder joint pain, right iliotibial 
band syndrome and the left hip injury. 
[Webb’s] testimony indicates the following: 1) [Webb] 
did not receive any treatment pursuant to Dr. DiCostanzo ’s 
treatment plan dated 4/26/2017; 2) [Webb] was requesting a 
reopening for further medical treatment for the left 
hip/leg and right knee; 3) the problems with the left 
hip/leg have been present since the industrial injury 
occurred on 4/1/1999; and 4) the problems with the right 
knee have been present for the past ten years.  
The WC-5 filed on 5/18/2017 indicates [Webb] was 
requesting a reopening of an old claim as [HIGA] failed to 
return calls.  
The Director denied Webb ’s request for a reopening and 
medical treatment under the DiCostanzo Treatment Plan, pursuant 
to HRS § 386 -89(c), stating : 
The Director finds, based upon the above Findings of Fact 
and Principles of Law, the claimant ’s request for a 
reopening for further benefits, or any other injured body 
parts under this claim (including the treatment requested 
in the treatment plan dated 4/26/2017), is denied.  The 
Director credits the employer ’s testimony, the final WC -3 
for the year 2005, Dr. DiCostanzo ’s treatment plan dated 
4/26/2017, the claimant ’s testimony, and the WC -5 filed on 
5/18/2017, and determines the claimant ’s right to further 
benefits is barred by the eight -year statute of limitation s  
pursuant to Section 386 -89, HRS.  
 
(Emphasis added.) 
E. 2019 LIRAB Decision 
Webb filed an appeal to the LIRAB from the 2017 DCD 
Decision. The issue before the LIRAB was whether the Director 
erred in denying Webb’s request to reopen his claim for the work 
injury sustained in 1999, for treatment under Dr. DiCostanzo’s 
2017 Treatment Plan. 
The LIRAB held a trial over the course of two days in 
November 2018. In addition to considering exhibits, the LIRAB 
9  
 
 
   
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
heard testimony from Webb and Lianne Ching ( Ching), the claims 
examiner for HIGA. On August 21, 2019, the  LIRAB  issued a 
decision and order ( 2019 LIRAB Decision ) affirming the Director,  
with majority and concurring opinions. The LIRAB majority made 
findings, including:  
1. On April 1, 19 99, Claimant sustained a work 
injury to his low back and left hip. 
 . . . 
6. Based on the Director’s unchallenged March 12, 
2003 decision, the Board finds that Claimant was awarded 
medical care, services and supplies for the left hip, but 
not for the low back, which resolved. 
7. The Board finds that Claimant’s April 1, 1999 
work injury claim was properly and administratively closed 
by Employer in 2007, by a final WC -3 report, after Claimant 
last treated with Dr. Saito on November 23, 2004. The 
Board credits Ms. Ching’s testim ony. 
8. The Board credits Ms. Ching’s testimony that it 
was Employer’s practice to mail copies of Claimant’s WC -3 
reports to Claimant’s home address. The Board finds that 
Claimant’s allegation of “gross mismanagement” of 
Claimant’s file, including “concealing ” the 2007 closure of 
Claimant’s case in March 2007, is unsupported by the 
credible evidence in this case. 
9. The Board finds that Claimant’s May 18, [2017] 
WC-5 request for reopening of his April 1, 1999 work injury 
for medical treatment was filed more than eight years after 
Employer’s last payment for medical benefits and is 
therefore barred by the applicable 8 -year statute of 
limitations . 
10. The Board finds no treatment plan requests were 
submitted after the Director’s 2003 decision, until 2017. 
11. The Board finds that Claimant’s 2017 request for 
reopening for an alleged change in condition is barred by 
the 8-year statute of limitations for reopening a claim. 
Claimant did not meet his burden, by substantial evidence, to support his application for reopening .  
(Emphases added.)

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
In its analysis, t he LIRAB majority stated that Webb’s 
records show that after his last treatment with Dr. Saito in 
November 2005, he sought treatment under his private medical 
insurance and only sought further treatment under workers’ 
compensation in 2017. The LIRAB majority further stated: 
Contrary to Claimant’s allegation that Employer had 
the burden of proof regarding a statute of limitations 
defense, Section 386 -89(c), HRS and the applicable case law 
clearly establish that it is Claimant’s burden to show, by 
substantial evidence, a change in or a mistake in a 
determination of fact relating to the claimant’s physical 
condition.  The presumption applies only to the work -
relatedness of the injuries once a case is reopened, not to reopening or review. In the instant case, the Board finds that Claimant did not present substantial evidence to 
support his request for reopening .  
(Emphases added.) The LIRAB majority ultimately concluded that 
Webb’s request for reopening was barred by the “statute of 
limitations ” under HRS § 386 -89(c).3 
3 The LIRAB majority also concluded Webb’s 2017 claims related to 
his right wrist and right leg/knee were barred by HRS § 386 -82 (2015). The 
LIRAB majority found these were additional injuries that were not part of the 
April 1, 1999 work injury, such t hat 2-year and 5 -year limitation periods 
applied under HRS § 386 -82, which states: 
The right to compensation under this chapter shall be 
barred unless a written claim therefor is made to the 
director of labor and industrial relations[:] 
(1) Within two years after the date at which the 
effects of the injury for which the employee is entitled 
to compensation have become manifest; and 
(2) Within five years after the date of the accident 
or occurrence which caused the injury. 
We decide this case under the eight -year period for reopening a 
claim under HRS § 386-89(c) and thus do not reach any issues 
pertaining to HRS § 386 -82. 
11  
 
 
   The LIRAB concurring opinion, on the other hand, 
stated that employer  OSF  was raising a statute of limitations 
defense under HRS § 386-89(c) that the eight-year period had 
expired.   The concurring opinion further stated:  
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
  
    
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
I find that a statute of limitations defense is an 
affirmative defense and that Employer, who raises a defense 
based on a statute of limitations, has the burden of proving that Claimant’s reopening request is barred by the 
time limitations provisions under  HRS Section 386- 89(c). 
Therefore, in my view, it is Employer’s burden of proof to 
support its statute of limitations defense under HRS 
Section 386 -89(c).  
(Emphasis added.) The concurring opinion found, among other 
things, that Webb’s claim was administratively closed by a WC -3 
Final Report filed on March 6, 2007, and that his request to 
reopen was barred by the eight -year limitations period under HRS 
§ 386-89(c) because his request to reopen was filed about twelve 
years after the last payment of compensation made by Employer in 
2005. The concurring opinion noted it was thus unnecessary “to 
address whether Employer ha [d] rebutted the presumption of 
compensa bility by substantial evidence, ” i.e., whether OSF had 
rebutted Webb’s claims that his current right wrist and right 
knee injuries were related to the primary injury of April 1999. 
F. The ICA Decision 
On September 4, 2019, Webb timely filed a Notice of 
Appeal to the ICA from the 2019 LIRAB Decision . At the ICA, 
Webb raised six points of error, including that the LIRAB erred 
by not requiring OSF/HIGA to prove essential facts for a statute 
12  
 
 
   We granted Webb’s application for writ of certiorari 
to address whether Webb or OSF/HIGA  had the burden of proof to 
show if Webb’s reopening request was within the eight-year 
statute of limitations period under HRS § 386-89(c).  
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
of limitations defense under HRS § 386-89(c), and by determining 
that  Webb’s workers’ compensation case  was properly closed. The 
ICA affirmed the LIRAB.   With regard to the burden of proof 
under HRS § 386-89(c), the ICA concluded that the LIRAB “did not 
clearly err in finding that Webb did not provide substantial 
evidence to support his reopening application.”  
III. STANDARD OF REVIEW 
In this case, we interpret a workers’ compensation 
statute. 
The interpretation of a statute is a question of law that 
is reviewed de novo. 
When construing a statute, our foremost obligation is 
to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the 
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from 
the language contained in the statute itself. And we 
must read statutory language in the context of the 
entire statute and construe it in a manner consistent 
with its purpose. 
When there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or 
indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an expression 
used in a statute, an ambiguity exists . . . . 
In construing an ambiguous statute, the meaning of 
the ambiguous words may be sought by examining the 
context with which the ambiguous words, phrases, and 
sentences may be compared, in order to ascertain 
their true meaning. Moreover, the courts may resort 
to extrinsic aids in determining legislative intent. 
One avenue is the use of legislative history as an 
interpretive tool.

IV. DISCUSSION 
A. The Eight -Year Period in HRS § 386-89(c) is a Statute of 
Limitations For Which the Employer Has the Burden of Proof 
Webb raised a variety of issues before the ICA that 
are not entirely consistent with the questions he raises before 
this court.4 However, one issue before the LIRAB that he argued 
to both the ICA and to this court is that the burden of proof 
related to reopening of a claim under HRS § 386-89(c) rests on 
the employer. Webb argued to the ICA that the LIRAB majority 
conflated two different requirements under HRS § 386 -89(c) — 
first, the requirement that an application for reopening of the 
claim is made within the eight -year period after the last 
compensation was paid; and second, the requirement to show by 
substantial evidence a change in, or a mistake in a 
determination of fact as to, the physical condition of the 
injured employee. Webb argued to the ICA that employer OSF had 
the burden of proof as to both requirements under HRS § 386 -
89(c). 
In addressing this issue , the ICA stated: “Here, the 
[LIRAB] found that Webb did not meet his burden to support his 
application for reopening. We conclude that the [LIRAB] did not 
4 Webb’s application for writ of certiorari to this court asserts 
the following issues which were not issues before the LIRAB or points of 
error raised in the ICA: whether there should have been scrutiny of HIGA’s 
breach of good faith for unilateral terminat ion and concealment; whether such 
errors contributed to years -long denial of benefits to Webb. These issues 
are deemed waived and we will not address them. 
14  
 
 
    
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
clearly err in finding that Webb did not provide substantial 
evidence to support his reopening application.” (Emphasis 
added.)   Although the ICA’s discussion on burden of proof did 
not specify what aspect of HRS § 386-89(c) it was addressing (i.e.,  the eight-year requirement or a change in condition), the 
ICA SDO later recognized that “the [LIRAB] concluded that Webb’s 2017 request for reopening for an alleged change in condition 
was barred by the 8-year statute of limitations for reopening a 
claim.”   (Emphasis added.)   It thus appears the ICA held that 
Webb had the burden of proof to establish  that  his reopening 
request was timely under the statutory eight-year requirement.  
Moreover, as previously explained, the LIRAB ha d a 
split of opinion as to which party bears the burden of proof 
regarding the eight -year statute of limitations. The LIRAB 
majority seems to have relied on language in HRS § 386-89(c), 
pertaining to the need for substantial evidence on a claimant’s 
change in condition, and extrapolated that to hold that the 
claimant also has the burden of proof on the eight -year 
requirement. The LIRAB concurring opinion, on the other hand, 
expressly treated the eight -year period as a statute of 
limitations, and thus as an affirmative defense raised by 
OSF/HIGA. The concurring opinion determined that OSF/HIGA “has 
the burden of proving that [Webb’s] reopening request is barred 
by the time limitations provisions under HRS Se ction 386 -89(c).”

The concurring opinion then concluded that OSF/HIGA met their 
burden to show that Webb’s reopening claim was untimely. 
We focus on the burden of proof for the requirement in 
HRS § 386-89(c) that an application to reopen a claim must be 
made “prior to eight years after date of the last payment of 
compensation[.]” If an application for reopening is barred by 
the eight -year period, it is not necessary to address the other 
requirement of a showing by substantial evidence of a change in, 
or a mistake in a determination of fact as to, the physical 
condition of the injured employee.5 
HRS § 386-89(c) is silent as to which party has the 
burden of proof on the requirement that application for 
reopening be made in the eight -year period. The applicable 
administrative rule for reopening a workers’ compensation case 
5 We note that this court, in De Victoria v. H & K Contractors , 56 
Haw. 552, 556, 561, 545 P.2d 692, 696, 699 (1976), stated that “[w]e do not 
believe that a showing of substantial evidence is necessary as a prerequisite 
to a review by the Director or the [LIRAB] of an application under 
subparagraph (c) of HRS § 386 –89,” and held that: 
a proceeding brought by a claimant under HRS s 386 -89(c) is 
plainly a ‘proceeding for the enforcement of a claim for 
compensation under (our workmen's compensation) chapter .’ 
HRS s 386 -85. Where . . . the primary issue is whether or 
not an injury is related to a work accident, a claimant is 
entitled to the same presumption on review of a case once 
closed that his claim is for a covered injury as that in an 
original hearing. 
See also Mitchell v. BWK Joint Venture , 57 Haw. 535, 548, 560 P.2d 1292, 1300 
(1977) (citations omitted) (noting the “presumption that ‘the claim is for a 
covered work injury’ in the absence of substantial evidence to the 
contrary”). 
16  
 
 
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
is likewise silent as to the burden of proof. HAR § 12 -10-63 
provides: 
(a) An application for reopening of a case pursuant 
to section 386 -89, HRS, shall be in writing, shall state 
specifically the grounds upon which the application is 
based, and shall be served upon each party at the time of 
filing with the director. 
(b) Whenever an application for reopening of a case 
is made, the director shall review the case file and may, 
by discretion, hear the interested parties. The director 
shall deny or grant a reopening and notify the parties in 
writing. 
The LIRAB majority and concurring opinions, and the 
parties, refer to the eight -year period as a “statute of 
limitations.” We agree that the eight -year period under HRS 
§ 386-89(c) serves as a statute of limitations. The plain 
effect of the eight -year period is that it sets a time limit 
within which an application for reopening should be made. We 
agree with the LIRAB’s concurring opinion that, a s a statute of 
limitations , the eight -year period in HRS § 386-89(c) is 
properly treated as an affirmative defense, and thus, the 
employer has the burden of proof on this issue. 
  We note that HRS § 386-89(c) is titled “Reopening of 
cases; continuing jurisdiction of director.” Neither party 
contends that the eight-year period serves as a jurisdictional 
prerequisite for the Director to act. “Where a  statute is 
ambiguous, its title  may be referred to as an aid in 
construing  the  statute.” Tauese v. State,  Dep’t of Lab.  & 
Indus. Rels., 113 Hawai‘i  1, 37, 147 P.3d 785, 821 (2006)

(quoting Honolulu Star Bull ., Ltd. v. Burns , 50 Haw. 603, 606, 
446 P.2d 171, 173 (1968) ). Here, however, we conclude the 
statute plainly sets out the eight-year period as a statute of 
limitations and not a bar to the Director’s jurisdiction. 
First, there is no reference in the statutory language that a 
jurisdictional bar is intended. 
Second, given the humanitarian purposes of the 
workers’ compensation scheme, HRS § 386-89(c) must be liberally 
construed in favor of injured employees. “[T]his court has long 
recognized the remedial character of the workers ’ compensation 
statutes and has construed them liberally to effectuate their 
beneficent purposes. ” Puchert v. Agsalud , 67 Haw. 25, 36, 677 
P.2d 449, 457 (1984) (citations omitted) ; Van Ness v. State, 
Dep’t of Educ. , 131 Hawai‘i 545, 558, 319 P.3d 464, 4 77 (2014) 
(“[T]he broad humanitarian purpose of the workers ’ compensation 
statute read as a whole requires that all reasonable doubts be 
resolved in favor of the claimant.” (quoting Lawhead v. United 
Air Lines, 59 Haw. 551, 5 60, 584 P.2d 119, 12 5 (1978))). 
It is beneficial to employees to construe the eight-
year period as a statute of limitations, rather than a 
requirement that could preclude the Director from having 
jurisdiction to consider a reopening application . As a statute 
of limitations , the eight -year period would properly be treated 
as an affirmative defense that the employer must establish and 
18  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
which  can be waived.   Hawai‘i  law generally treats statutes of 
limitations as affirmative defenses.   See  Pac.  Lightnet, Inc. v. 
Time Warner Telecom, Inc., 131 Hawai ‘i 257, 281, 318 P.3d 97, 121 
(2013); State v. Stan’s Contracting, Inc., 111 Hawai‘ i 17, 33, 
137 P.3d 331, 347 (2006) (citations omitted); Hawai‘ i  Rules of 
Civil Procedure Rule 8(c) (listing statute of limitations as an 
affirmative defense).   Moreover, the party asserting an 
affirmative defense generally has the burden of proving the facts essential to the defense.   See,  e.g.,  U.S.  Bank  Nat.  Ass’n  
v.  Castro, 131 Hawai῾ i  28, 41, 313 P.3d 717, 730 (2013)  (citation 
omitted); Lambert  v.  Waha, 137 Hawai ῾i  423, 432, 375 P.3d 202,

adverse possession, defendant asserting the defense had the 
burden “to produce admissible evidence to support the elements 
of adverse possession ”); Molokoa  Vill.  Dev.  Co.  v.  Kauai  Elec.  
Co., 60 Haw. 582, 589, 593 P.2d 375, 380 (1979); Quinn  v.  
Wilshire  Ins.  Co., 53 Haw. 19, 21, 486 P.2d 59, 60 (1971)  
(citations omitted)  (when an insurer relies on an exclusionary 
clause of a policy as an affirmative defense to liability, “it 
has  the burden  of proving  facts which bring the case within the  
exclusion”); In re  Dowsett  Tr., 7 Haw. App. 640, 646, 791 P.2d 
398, 402–03 (1990)  (for the affirmative defense of res judicata, 
“the party asserting the defense has the burden  of proving

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
adequate representation of the interests and proper protection 
of the rights of the nonparty in the prior action ”). 
Placing the burden of proof on employers rather than 
employees further effectuates the humanitarian purposes of the 
statute because employers are mo re likely to be in possession of 
the documentation showing the last payment of compensation. It 
is thus consistent with the workers’ compensation scheme that 
employers have the burden of proof to establish whether the 
eight-year period has been met. 
In other jurisdictions , statutes for reopening a 
workers’ compensation case have generally been treated as 
statute of limitations defense s. 
Among the issues affecting reopening time periods, 
there may be noted the question whether failure to make 
timely application goes to the Commission’s jurisdiction or 
merely give s rise to an affirmative defense which may be 
waived, for example, by failure to raise it promptly. The 
majority rule here, as in the case of original notice or 
claim, is that the defect is not jurisdictional and may be 
waived, but the opposite view has so me case support.

(explaining “the statute of limitations  provisions in the Labor 
Code must be liberally construed in favor of the injured

Under Hawai‘i’s workers’ compensation scheme, the time 
period for asserting the original notice or claim is treated as 
a statute of limitations. See Hayashi v. Scott Co. , 93

(construing HRS § 386-82). Thus, in the context of the entire 
workers’ compensation scheme, it is consistent to construe an 
application for reopening a workers’ compensation claim in a 
similar manner. The definition of a “statute of limitations” 
21  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
includes “[a] law that bars claims after a specified period[,]” 
and “[t]he purpose of such a statute is to require diligent 
prosecution of known claims, thereby providing finality and 
predictability in legal affairs and ensuring that claims will be 
resolved while evidence is reasonably available and fresh.” 
Statute of Limitations, Black’s Law Dictionary  (12th  ed. 2024).    
This court has explained that “[t]he  primary purpose of a 
statute  of  limitations  is to compel the exercise of a right of

Further, a statute of limitations is a policy decision 
by the Legislature. 
Statutes of limitations are best understood as an 
accommodation of competing interests: the plaintiff wishes 
to have a reasonable time to bring the suit . . . while the 
defendant, on the other hand, seeks to avoid having to 
defend against stale claims. Limitation statutes afford 
plaintiffs what the legislature deems a reasonable time to 
present their claims. The y reflect policy determinations 
of the legislature and represent a policy decision 
regarding what constitutes an adequate period of time for a 
person of ordinary diligence to pursue a claim. 
51 Am. Jur. 2d Limitation of Actions  § 2  (2024).   With respect 
to HRS §  386-89(c) and its predecessor statutes, the Territorial 
and State Legislatures  of Hawai‘ i  have  addressed multiple times 
the policy question of the appropriate time period in which an 
application to reopen a workers’ compensation case must be made.  
Hawai‘i’s first Workers’ Compensation Act was adopted 
in 1915. 1915 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 221 , at 323 -50. In 1939, the 
Act was amended to expressly state the period in which a 
workers’ compensation case could be reopened, providing:6 
Sec. 7517. Reopening case; modification of awards 
and agreements .. . . 
On the application of any party on the ground of a 
change of conditions, the board may, at any time within 
seven years after the date of the injury or accident or 
within three years after the date of final payment of 
compensation previously awarded, whichever period is longer, and not oftener than once in six months, review any 
6 The Workers’ Compensation Act (then, the “Workmen’s Compensation 
Act”) was first codified in the Revised Laws of Hawai ῾i (RLH) in 1925, then 
renumbered multiple times. See, e.g. , RLH §§ 3604 -3667 (1925); RLH §§ 7480 -
7541 (1935); RLH §§ 4401 -4467 (1945); RLH §§ 97 -1 to 97-123 (1955). In 1963, 
the legislature subsequently recodified RLH chapter 97 as HRS chapter 386. 
See RLH Tables of Disposition, Table 1, at 9 (1968); HRS chapter 3 86 (1968) 
(indicating as a historical note, “[t]his chapter is based on L 1963, c 116, 
which completely revised and reenacted this chapter”); see also 1963 Haw. 
Sess. Laws Act 116, at 103 -28.

agreement or award, and on review may make an award ending, 
diminishing or increasing the compensation previously 
agreed upon or awarded subject to the maximum and minimum 
provided in this chapter [.] 
1939 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 206 , § 3 at 306 (emphasis added) . A 
prior version of the 1939 bill had provided no limit for 
reopening a case, but a report by t he House Committee on 
Judiciary explained why a time limitation was added: 
In computing premiums on compensation policies, it is 
necessary that some rule should obtain under which the 
premiums may be more or less definitely fixed, and your Committee believes that while an award should be subject to 
reopening at any time for fraud, nevertheless, where it is 
sought by either party to reopen it because of changed 
conditions, there should be a limitation of seven years 
from the date of the injury or accident or three years from the date of the last payment of compensation whichever 
period is the longer, and your Committee has therefore 
amended the second paragraph of section 7517, as contained 
in section 3 of the Bill, accordingly.  
H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 396, in 1939 House Journal, at 1340 
(emphasis added) . 
In 1953, the relevant provision was amended to state: 
the director may, at any time prior to three years after 
date of the last payment of compensation, . . . or at any 
time prior to three years after the rejection of a claim, 
review a compensation case and issue a new decision which 
may terminate, continue, reinstate, increase or decrease 
such compensation, or award compensation. 
1953 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 51, § 1 at 167 . 
24   In 1955, the reopening statute was amended to change 
the period of time from three years after the date of last 
payment of compensation or rejection of a claim, to ten years 
after the date of last payment of compensation or rejection of a 
claim. 1955 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 5, § 1 at 4.   
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Finally, in 1985, the applicable time period under HRS 
§ 386-89(c) was adopted, changing the ten-year period to the 
eight-year period. 1985 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 296, § 9 at 645-
46.   Thus, the relevant part of the statute now reads:  
On the application of any party in interest, 
supported by a showing of substantial evidence, on the 
ground of a change in or of a mistake in a determination of fact related to the physical condition of the injured 
employee, the director may, at any time prior to eight 
years after date of the last payment of compensation, 
whether or not a decision awarding compensation has been 
issued, or at any time prior to eight years after the rejection of a claim, review a compensation case and issue 
a decision which may award, terminate, continue, reinstate, 
increase, or decrease compensation.  
(Emphases added.)   Addressing the 1985 amendment on reopening a 
case, the House Committee on Employment Opportunities and Labor 
Relations and the House Committee on Consumer Protection and 
Commerce issued a joint committee report stating:  
The purpose of Section 11 of this Bill is to amend 
the provisions of section 386 -89(c) to reduce the ten -year 
time limit  for reopening applications to an eight -year time 
limit  for reopening requests.  
Your Committees believe that a shorter timeframe 
furthers the timely and expeditious disposition of cases  
within the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations.  
H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 326, in 1985 House Journal, at 1130  
(emphases added).   Describing the overall purpose of the 1985 
legislation, the Senate Committee on Labor and Employment 
explained that:  
The purpose of this bill is to amend the Workers’ 
Compensation law to make the system both effective and 
efficient. . . .  
After careful review of both house drafts of this 
measure and consideration of recommendations proposed in 
the Study of Workers’ Compensation Program of the State of 
Hawaii by Haldi Associates, Inc. as submitted by the

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Legislative Auditor  . . .,  your Committee recognizes the 
need to effectively reform existing insurance and workers’ 
compensation laws. Alternate approaches consistent with 
the humanitarian objectives and purposes of the workers’ 
compensation law have been adopted to achieve meaningful 
controls upon costs and to reestablish the integrity of the process of claim handling and rate making .  
S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 806, in 1985 Senate Journal, at 1230 
(underlining deleted and added). Further, the Senate Ways and 
Means Committee explained generally that “[t]he purpose of this 
bill is to address a major insurance crisis confronting 
employers and businesses in Hawaii brought about by skyrocketing 
costs of workers’ compensation insurance coverage in recent 
years.” S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 853, in 1985 Senate Journal, 
at 1254. 
Given this history of the current eight -year time 
period, the Legislature has expressed an intent to set a time 
limit by statute for reopening a workers’ compensation case for 
policy reasons that include: the ability to better compute 
premiums, the timely disposition of cases, balanc ing the 
humanitarian purpose of workers’ compensation with meaningful 
controls on the cost, and promoting integrity in claims handling 
and rate making. Consistent with this intent, we conclude it is 
proper to construe the eight -year period in HRS § 386 -89(c) as a 
statute of limitations. 
As noted above, because t he eight -year period under 
HRS § 386 -89(c) is a statute of limitations, it operates as an 
affirmative defense for which employer OSF had the burden of 
26  
 
 
  
 
   
    
   
 
  
    
 
  
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
proof. In this case, OSF clearly raised the eight -year limit in 
responding to Webb’s application to the Director to reopen his 
case. Further, the eight -year period was triggered by the “date 
of the last payment of compensation” and the record shows that 
OSF established the last payment of workers’ compensation 
benefits made by OSF/HIGA was in 2005. Webb’s application to 
reopen was filed with the Director on May 18, 2017,7 nearly 
twelve years after the last payment of compensation made by 
OSF/HIGA in 2005. OSF/HIGA thus met their burden to prove that 
Webb’s application to reopen his workers’ compensation case is 
barred by the eight -year limitations period under HRS § 386 -
89(c). 
B. The ICA Did Not Err in Holding that Webb ’s Workers ’ 
Compensation C ase was Properly Closed in 2007 
Webb argues that the ICA erred in affirming the 
administrative closure of his workers’ compensation claim 
because HRS § 386 -95 (2015) does not provide an administrative 
basis for closure of a claim.8 Webb cites to the portion of HRS 
§ 386-95, governing reports of injuries, other reports, and 
penalty, which provides in relevant part , “[w]ithin thirty days 
after final payment of compensation for an injury, the employer 
7 HAR § 12-10-63 provides, inter alia , that an application for 
reopening of a case under HRS § 386-89 shall be in writing and served upon 
each party at the time it is filed with the Director. 
8 It should be noted that neither the 2019 LIRAB Decision nor the 
ICA's SDO discuss or rely on HRS § 386 -95. 
27  
 
 
   
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
shall file a final report with the director showing the total 
payments made, the date of termination of temporary total 
disability, and such other information as the director may 
require. ” Webb appears to believe that HRS § 386 -95 is 
applicable here because he asserts the statute “is the only 
worker’s compensation statutory reference to reports.” The ICA 
held that “when HIGA filed the final WC -3 indicating that Webb ’s 
file was to be closed . . . the claim was properly closed. ” 
The ICA relied on Skahan v. Stutts Constr uction Co., 
No. CAAP-16-0000537  and No. CAAP-16-0000538, 2019 WL 3765413  
(Haw. App. Aug. 9, 2019) (SDO), cert. denied,  No. SCWC-16-
0000537  and No. SCWC-16-0000538, 2019 WL 6737092. In Skahan, a 
claimant asserted that the LIRAB erred in denying his request 
for a reopening of his workers’  compensation claim.   Id.  at *3.   
The LIRAB concluded that the claimant’s request to reopen was 
filed more than eight years after the last date of compensation 
was paid by his employer for the work injury, and was therefore barred by the eight-year statute of limitations provided by HRS 
§  386-89(c). Id.  at *9.   In holding the LIRAB did not err in 
denying the claimant’s request to reopen, the ICA determined 
that the claimant was aware of the last payment of compensation 
because the insurance carrier notified him that his case would 
be closed following the final payment of compensation, but that 
28  
 
 
  
  Similarly, here, Webb sought to reopen his workers’  
compensation claim, but the LIRAB found that his request to 
reopen was filed more than eight years after the last date of 
compensation was paid by OSF/HIGA for his work injury,  and  was  
therefore time barred by HRS § 386-89(c).   The record, which 
includes a declaration and testimony by HIGA’s claims examiner Ching, indicates the 2007 WC-3 Report  was filed as a “Final 
Report”  with a copy sent to Webb at his address and that the 
last payment by HIGA was in 2005.   Included at the bottom of the 
2007 WC-3 Report  was a “Notice to Employee”  stating that:  “With 
the final payment of compensation (as indicated hereon) on your 
industrial injury of 04/01/1999 identified as Case No. 29904705 
the case shall be closed.   This determination shall not 
constitute a bar to your reopening rights as provided by Section 386-89, HRS, nor to future medical benefits.”   (Emphasis added.)   
Webb does not contest that he was sent the 2007 WC-3 Report 
containing this information. Thus, it appears that Webb was 
aware his case had been closed but that he could reopen his 
claim  pursuant to HRS § 386-89.  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the claimant could reopen his claim pursuant to HRS § 386 -89.

argues that the phrase “these benefits ” in that statute should

be construed liberally to include all of the “independent 
rights”  to statutory workers’  compensation benefits announced in  
Bocalbos v. Kapiolani Medical  Center for Women & Children, 89 
Hawai‘i 436, 974 P.2d 1026 (1999) and Lindinha v. Hilo Coast 
Processing Co., 104 Hawai ‘i 164, 86 P.3d 973 (2004).   However,  
HRS  § 386-31(b)  governs temporary total disability , stating:  9 
The payment of these benefits shall only be terminated upon 
order of the director or if the employee is able to resume 
work. When the employer is of the opinion that temporary 
total disability benefits should be terminated because the 
injured employee is able to resume work, the employer shall 
notify the employee and the director in writing of an 
intent to terminate the benefits at least two weeks prior 
to the date when the last payment is to be made. The 
notice shall give the reason for stopping payment and shall 
inform the employee that the employee may make a written 
request to the director for a hearing if the employee 
disagrees with the employer. Upon receipt of the request 
from the employee, the director shall conduct a hearing as 
expeditiously as possible and render a prompt decision as 
specified in section 386 -86. If the employee is unable to 
perform light work, if offered, temporary total disability 
9 In Bocalbos , this court held in relevant part that : 
One of the primary purposes of the Hawai ‘i workers' 
compensation law is the prompt determination and 
disposition of claims for compensation. Under the law, 
claimants are entitled to: (1) medical care, services, and 
supplies immediately after a work injury and so long as 
reasonably needed, HRS § 386 –21 (Supp.1998); (2) weekly 
wages for temporary disability, HRS §§ 386 –31(b) (1993) 
and 386–32(b) (Supp.1998); and (3) weekly wages for 
permanent disability, HRS §§ 386 –31(a) (1993) and 386 – 
32(a) (Supp.1998). These medical and wage benefits are 
independent benefits, separate and distinct from one 
another.

In Lindinha , this court discussed Bocalbos to conclude that an order 
denying a n HRS § 386 –93(b) request for fees and costs is a final order for 
purposes of appeal in worker compensation cases. 104 Hawai‘i at 169, 86 P.3d

benefits shall not be discontinued based solely on the 
inability to perform or continue to perform light work. 
(Emphases added.) 
Webb’s argument on this issue is not meritorious . 
First, neither the 2019 LIRAB Decision nor the ICA ’s SDO discuss 
or rely on HRS § 386 -31(b) in concluding that his workers’ 
compensation case was properly closed in 2007. 
Second, HRS § 386-31(b) does not apply to Webb because 
the record shows that Webb, OSF, and HIGA stipulated that Webb 
sustained “permanent partial disability ” to his left hip/leg. A 
plain reading of HRS § 386 -31(b) requires that the “work injury 
cause[] total disability not determined to be permanent in 
character ” in order for the statute to apply. Webb ’s work 
injury does not fall under the purview of HRS § 386 -31(b), and 
thus the statute is inapplicable here. 
Third, Webb does not provide any argument as to how 
his proposed interpretation of HRS § 386 -31(b) affects the ICA ’s 
holding that Webb ’s workers ’ compensation case was properly 
closed. As discussed above, the ICA reasoned that HIGA sent the 
2007 WC-3 report as a final report, which advised Webb his case 
was to be closed. Further, as argued by OSF/HIGA to the ICA, by 
the time the 2007 WC -3 final report was filed in March 2007, it 
had been over two years since HIGA had received any medical 
billing for Webb. The last billing ha d been received in 
November of 2004. Under HRS § 386-21(g), failure of a medical

services provider to bill the employer or insurer within two 
years of the date of service results in forfeiture of the 
provider’s right to payment. Thus, when the 2007 WC -3 final 
report was filed, it was reasonable for Webb’s case to be 
closed. Webb’s reliance on HRS § 386-31(b) is misplaced . 
In sum, Webb does not raise any meritorious arguments 
that the ICA gravely err ed in holding that Webb’s workers ’ 
compensation case was properly closed.
