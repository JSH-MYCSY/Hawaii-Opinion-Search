 (for the drug crimes), to run consecutively with a ten-year term 
for the negligent homicide charge.  Cattaneo moved under Hawai‘ i 
Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 35(b) to reduce this 
sentence.  He wanted his five-year sentences to run 
concurrently, rather than consecutively, with his ten-year term. 
Cattaneo supported his Rule 35(b) motion by arguing that 
his consecutive sentence was harsher than those of two second 
circuit defendants recently convicted of, and sentenced for, 
negligent homicide in the first degree.  Hawai‘ i Revised Statutes 
(HRS) § 706-606 (2014) identifies the factors courts must 
consider “in imposing a sentence.”  Cattaneo argued that one 
factor courts must consider “in imposing a sentence” was HRS 
§ 706-606(4), “[t]he need to avoid unwarranted sentence 
disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.”  As such, he reasoned that the 
trial court, in deciding his Rule 35(b) motion, should have 
considered the sentences imposed in “comparable cases.” 
The court denied Cattaneo’s motion to reduce his sentence.  
And it declined to discuss the “comparable cases” Cattaneo had 
identified, explaining: “[I]t’s not the Court’s practice to 
review cases that are issued by other Courts, whether in this 
                                                 
in the third degree and one count of prohibited acts related to drug 
paraphernalia in 2PC151000122.  The Honorable Richard T. Bissen, Jr. 
presided. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 circuit or others.  Because I happen to know that every case is 
nuanced, every case has something that may not be obvious to 
someone.” 
Cattaneo appealed.  He claimed the trial court had abused 
its discretion by denying his HRPP Rule 35(b) motion without 
comparing his sentence to those imposed in the two “comparable 
cases.”  Underlying Cattaneo’s argument is the postulation that 
courts deciding HRPP Rule 35(b) motions must consider each HRS § 706-606 sentencing factor. 
The Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) affirmed the 
circuit court’s denial of Cattaneo’s Rule 35(b) motion.  It said 
that courts had to consider the HRS § 706-606 sentencing factors 
in adjudicating Rule 35(b) motions.  And it concluded that the 
trial court had adequately done so in deciding Cattaneo’s. 
Cattaneo asks us to determine whether the ICA erred in 
“ruling that the Circuit Court substantively considered 
sentencing factor HRS § 706-606(4) despite clear evidence to the contrary.”

2  Cattaneo’s application for writ of certiorari also presents two other 
questions.  The first is whether the ICA erred in “ruling that the circuit 
court adequately articulated its reasons for consecutive term sentencing 
pursuant to HRS § 706- 668.5(2).”  We do not find error in the ICA’s ruling 
that the circuit court was not required to articulate “its reasons for consecutive term sentencing” when denying Cattaneo’s Rule 35(b) motion.  
Cattaneo’s application for writ of certiorari also asks us to consider 
whether the ICA erred in failing to recognize “plain error” in the trial 
court’s sentencing decision.  We conclude that the ICA did not gravely err in 
failing to recognize “plain error” in the trial court’s sentencing decision.  
Cattaneo’s “plain error” argument rehashes his contention that the trial 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 The question Cattaneo presents is beside the point.  The 
ICA did not err in affirming the trial court.  But its reasoning 
was off.  The HRS § 706-606 sentencing factors govern 
sentencing.  They do not govern motions for reduction of a 
sentence under HRPP Rule 35(b).  Thus, the trial court had no 
obligation to consider “[t]he need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been 
found guilty of similar conduct” – or any other HRS § 706-606 sentencing factor – in deciding Cattaneo’s Rule 35(b) motion. 
I. 
 The ICA rejected Cattaneo’s contention that the trial court 
disregarded HRS § 706–606(4) in ruling on Cattaneo’s Rule 35(b) 
motion.3  But it agreed with Cattaneo’s premise that courts 
deciding motions under HRPP Rule 35(b) must consider the HRS § 706–606 sentencing factors.  Citing State v. Sauceda, No. 
30622, 2011 WL 1909112 (App. May 18, 2011) (SDO), the ICA stated: 
This court has also concluded that a circuit court must 
consider the factors set forth in HRS § 706– 606 in ruling 
                                                 
court should have considered the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing 
disparities in deciding Cattaneo’s Rule 35(b) motion. 
 
3  The ICA concluded that while the circuit court may have foregrounded 
the penological goals of retribution and deterrence in adjudicating 
Cattaneo’s Rule 35(b) motion, it had adequately considered HRS § 706–606(4).  
The court’s consideration of HRS § 706–606(4) was sufficient, the ICA 
explained, because contrary to Cattaneo’s contentions, the circuit court 
didn’t have to justify its denial of Cattaneo’s Rule 35(b) motion with a 
discussion of “comparable cases.”  The trial court’s reference to, and 
rejection of, Cattaneo’s disparate sentencing argument showed it had adequately considered HRS § 706–606(4) in deciding Cattaneo’s motion.

 on an HRPP Rule 35(b) motion to reduce sentence.  See, 
e.g., State v. Sauceda, No. 30622, 2011 WL 1909112, *1 
(Haw. App. May 18, 2011) (SDO) (citing Kahapea, 111 Hawai‘ i 
at 278, 280– 82, 141 P.3d at 451, 453– 55) . . . . 
 
A solitary pincite to our decision in State v. Kahapea, 111 
Hawai‘i 267, 141 P.3d 440 (2006), is Sauceda’s only support for 
its conclusion that the HRS § 706–606 sentencing factors control 
the disposition of Rule 35(b) motions. 
II. 
Kahapea does not support the conclusion that courts 
deciding Rule 35(b) motions must consider the HRS § 706-606 factors. 
Kahapea and several co-defendants were convicted of crimes 
linked to a bid-rigging scheme that bilked Honolulu taxpayers out of millions of dollars.  Kahapea’s sentence – five 
consecutive ten-year terms of imprisonment - was much harsher 
than those of his co-defendants and the defendants in two other 
cases involving the theft of public funds. 
Kahapea moved to reduce and correct his sentence.  He said 
his sentence was “extremely harsh” compared to those of his co-defendants and other allegedly-similar defendants; he wanted one 
or more of his prison terms to run concurrently, rather than 
consecutively.  Kahapea, 111 Hawai‘ i at 275, 141 P.3d at 448.  
The circuit court denied Kahapea’s motion.  It explained that 
Kahapea’s comparatively harsh sentence was justified because, 
among other reasons, Kahapea had “mastermind[ed]” a theft of *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 public funds, used the booty to bankroll his lavish lifestyle, 
and abused a position of trust.  Id. at 276-77, 141 P.3d at 449-
450.   
This court evaluated Kahapea’s argument by re-reviewing the 
original sentence.  We concluded that the circuit court did not 
abuse its discretion by giving Kahapea a comparatively harsh 
sentence.  We affirmed the denial of Kahapea’s Rule 35 motion,4 
explaining that “while stern, the circuit court’s sentence 
furthers the statutory penological goals of retribution, 
incapacitation, and deterrence and does not reflect arbitrary or 
capricious action or a rigid refusal to consider the defendant’s 
contentions.”  Id. at 282, 141 P.3d at 455 (cleaned up).   
Implicit in Kahapea’s holding is the determination that 
because the court did not abuse its discretion in imposing 
Kahapea’s sentence, it also did not abuse its discretion by 
denying Kahapea’s motion.   
This conclusion does not require that courts presented with 
Rule 35(b) motions must reconsider the HRS § 706–606 sentencing 
factors.  Kahapea summarized the trial court’s consideration of 
HRS § 706–606(4) at sentencing.  But it did not hold that trial 
                                                 
4  Our opinion suggests that Kahapea moved for both a correction of an 
illegal sentence under Rule 35(a) and a reduction of sentence under Rule 
35(b).  The opinion does not make clear which portions of its analysis 
concern Rule 35(a) versus Rule 35(b). *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
7 
 courts must reprise their consideration of HRS § 706–606(4) 
every time a defendant moves the court to reduce a sentence. 
There is also no statutory support for that proposition.  
Nothing in HRPP Rule 35(b) or HRS § 706–606 indicates courts 
considering Rule 35(b) motions must weigh the HRS § 706–606 
sentencing factors. 
Rule 35(b) provides courts discretion to reduce, or not 
reduce, a sentence within specified timeframes: 
(b) Reduction of Sentence.  The court may reduce a sentence 
within 90 days after the sentence is imposed, or within 90 
days after receipt by the court of a mandate issued upon 
affirmance of the judgment or dismissal of the appeal, or 
within 90 days after entry of any order or judgment of the 
Supreme Court of the United States denying review of, or 
having the effect of upholding the judgment of conviction.  A motion to reduce a sentence that is made within the time 
prior shall empower the court to act on such motion even 
though the time period has expired.  The filing of a notice 
of appeal shall not deprive the court of jurisdiction to entertain a timely motion to reduce a sentence. 
 
HRPP Rule 35(b) (emphasis added).  This rule imposes some limits 
on when a court may reduce a sentence.  But nothing in it 
suggests a relationship between the HRS § 706–606 sentencing 
factors and Rule 35(b) motions. 
Likewise, by its terms, HRS § 706–6065 concerns imposing 
                                                 
5  HRS § 706-606 is entitled “Factors to be considered in imposing a 
sentence” (emphasis added).  It provides: 
 
The court, in determining the particular sentence to be imposed, 
shall consider: 
 
(1)  The nature and circumstances of the offense and the 
history and characteristics of the defendant; 
     (2)  The need for the sentence imposed: 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
8 
 sentences, not reducing them.  It begins: “The court, in 
determining the particular sentence to be imposed, shall 
consider . . . .”  And then lists the specific factors to be 
considered. 
 Thus, neither Kahapea, nor HRPP Rule 35(b), nor HRS § 706-
606 demands that courts considering motions for sentence 
reduction look to the HRS § 706-606 sentencing factors.6  
For sure, courts must consider the HRS § 706-606 factors 
when imposing a sentence.  See HRS § 706-606.  Defendants who 
believe a trial court has abused its discretion by ignoring HRS 
§ 706-606’s sentencing factors may appeal their sentences and 
make that case or bring motions under HRPP Rule 35(a).  See HRPP 
Rule 35(a) (stating in part that, within specified timeframes, the court “may correct a sentence imposed in an illegal 
                                                 
(a)  To reflect the seriousness of the offense, to 
promote respect for law, and to provide just 
punishment for the offense; 
(b)  To afford adequate deterrence to criminal 
conduct; (c)  To protect the public from further crimes of the 
defendant; and 
(d)  To provide the defendant with needed educational 
or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner; 
      (3)  The kinds of sentences available; and 
(4)  The need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities 
among defendants with similar records who have been found 
guilty of similar conduct.
 
 
HRS § 706
-606 (emphasi s added).  
 
6  Similarly, nothing in our caselaw, HRPP Rule 35(b), or HRS § 706-621 
(2014) suggests that courts adjudicating Rule 35(b) motions must consider the 
HRS § 706-621 factors (“Factors to be considered in imposing a term of 
probation”). *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 manner”). 
But a motion under HRPP Rule 35(b) is neither a sentencing 
nor a resentencing.  It asks the court to change its mind; it is 
“essentially a plea for leniency.”  Cf. State v. Brigham, 666 
A.2d 405, 406 (R.I. 1995) (describing a motion to reduce a sentence under Rhode Island’s equivalent of HRPP Rule 35 as 
“essentially a plea for leniency”).  HRPP Rule 35(b) motions 
give courts occasions to ponder clemency without obliging a re-
review of the statutory factors.  See State v. Kong, 140 Hawai‘ i 
103, 110, 398 P.3d 692, 699 (2017) (quoting United States v. 
Maynard, 485 F.2d 247, 248 (9th Cir. 1973), for the proposition 
that “[i]f a lawful sentence was lawfully imposed in the first 
instance, then the function of Rule 35 is simply to allow the 
[sentencing] court to decide if, on further reflection, the 
original sentence now seems unduly harsh”).7   
The distinction between sentencing and a hearing on a Rule 
35(b) motion is also shown by their procedural differences.  
Defendants don’t need to be present at hearings on motions to 
reduce a sentence.  See HRPP 43(c)(3).  And, unlike at 
                                                 
7  Accord State v. Hernandez, 849 P.2d 967, 968 (Idaho Ct. App. 1993) 
(discussing motions under Idaho Criminal Rules, Rule 35 and noting that 
“[t]he court is under no obligation to amend or modify a sentence that has 
been legally imposed”); State v. Tinsley,  928 P.2d 1220, 1223 (Alaska Ct. 
App. 1996) (stating that timely motion for reduction of sentence under then-
existing Alaska Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 35(a) could be granted 
based on judge’s desire to “show mercy”); State v. Remedio, 108 A.3d 326, 331 
(Del. Super. Ct. 2014) (“The reason for [Delaware’s Superior Court Criminal Rules, Rule 35(b)] is to give a sentencing judge a second chance to consider 
whether the initial sentence is appropriate.”). *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 sentencing, 
they have no constitutional right to allocute at 
those hearings. 
Treating HRPP Rule 35(b) motions as pleas for leniency that 
do not require reconsidering the HRS § 706–606 sentencing 
factors also makes sense from a practical standpoint.  Consider 
the defendant who argues their sentence should be reduced 
because, since sentencing, they have transformed from a violent 
person into a peaceful person (implicating HRS § 706-606(1), which concerns “the history and characteristics of the 
defendant”).  Under the Sauceda approach, the court would have 
to revisit every HRS § 706–606 sentencing factor to determine whether the lawfully-imposed sentence is still appropriate given 
the defendant’s new peaceable disposition.  This obligation – 
which, to repeat, has no basis in either HRPP Rule 35(b) or HRS 
§ 706-606 – would create an unwarranted imposition on courts’ 
broad discretion in sentencing matters.  
Cattaneo’s argument fails not because the court adequately 
considered HRS § 706–606(4), but rather because the court was not required to consider any HRS § 706–606 sentencing factor in 
deciding his Rule 35(b) motion. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 III. 
We hold that courts deciding HRPP Rule 35(b) motions are 
not required to consider the HRS § 706–606 sentencing factors.  
Although relying on different grounds than the ICA, we affirm 
the circuit court’s denial of Cattaneo’s HRPP Rule 35(b) motion. Pamela I. Lundquist,
