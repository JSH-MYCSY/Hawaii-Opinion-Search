OPINION OF THE COURT BY WILSON, J.  
I. INTRODUCTION   
 
 
 2   Because there was insufficient evidence that the 
defendant gained some benefit or value from another’s 
prostitution activity, we  reverse the circuit co urt’s judgment 
of conviction  and the ICA’s judgment on appeal  affirming the 
conviction.

712-1203(1)  (2016).,   After the jury returned its  verdict  of 
guilty, Ibarra filed a motion for judgment of acquittal, or in 
the alternative, for a new trial,  that was denied. At issue is 
whether a reasonable juror could have concluded that Ibarra 
“profit[ed] from prostitution” within the meaning of HRS § 712 -
1201  (2016).    321
1 The versions of the statutes applicable to this case are those 
that went into effect in October 2017 (incorporating amendments from 2016). 
2 HRS § 712 -1203(1) (2016) provides: “A person commits the offense 
of promoting prostitution if the person knowingly advances or profits from 
prostitution. ” 
3 HRS § 712 -1201 (2016) provides: 
(1) A person “advances prostitution ” if, acting other than as a 
prostitute or a patron of a prostitut e, the person knowingly 
causes or aids a person to commit or engage in prostitution, 
procures or solicits patrons for prostitution, provides persons 
for prostitution purposes, permits premises to be regularly used 
for prostitution purposes, operates or ass ists in the operation 
of a house of prostitution or a prostitution enterprise, or 
engages in any other conduct designed to institute, aid, or 
facilitate an act or enterprise of prostitution. 
(2) A person “profits from prostitution ” if, acting other than a s 
a prostitute receiving compensation for personally -rendered 
prostitution services, the person accepts or receives money or 
other property pursuant to an agreement or understanding with any 
person whereby the person participates or is to participate in 
the proceeds of prostitution activity.

II. BACKGROUND 
A. Circuit Court Proceedings 
1. Charges 
On November 15, 2017, the State charged Ibarra and co-
defendant Gustavo Ferreira (“Ferreira”) with sex t rafficking in 
violation of HRS § 712 -1202(1)(a) and kidnapping in violation of 
HRS § 707 -720(1)(e). 
2. Jury Trial 
At trial, both Ibarra and the complaining witness 
(“CW”) testified that they flew from Oakland, California to 
Honolulu, Hawaiʻi together on October 31, 2017.4 Ibarra paid for 
her own and CW’s airfare. Once in Hawaiʻi, Ibarra and CW stayed 
in hotel rooms in Waikiki together , which Ibarra also paid for. 
CW testified that it was her understanding that she 
and Ibarra were going to Hawaiʻi to “strip and dance” and that CW 
was going to repay Ibarra for her share of the airfare and hotel 
rooms as CW made money while in Hawaiʻi. Ibarra testified that 
CW characterized the trip as a “paycation [,]” meaning that they 
were on vacation but still gett ing paid. Samantha King 
4 CW testified that the reason her and Ibarra planned the trip to 
Hawaiʻi was because CW reached out to Ibarra after seeing Instagram posts of 
Ibarra in Hawaiʻi. CW explained that she asked Ibarra to take her along ne xt 
time Ibarra went to Hawaiʻi. CW further testified that she “had an idea” that 
Ibarra was involved in prostitution when she reached out to Ibarra. 
The dissent states that “CW and Ibarra arranged over Instagram to 
travel together to Hawaiʻi[,]” but omi ts the detail that it was CW who reached 
out to Ibarra on Instagram in order to initiate the trip to Hawaiʻi.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(“King”), a long -time friend of CW’s, testified that CW was 
“fully” aware that she was going to Hawaiʻi to engage in 
prostitution , and not just to strip and dance . 
After arriving in Hawaiʻi, Ibarra paid for and posted 
prostitut ion advertisements for her and CW on a website called 
Backpage. Ibarra took photographs of CW, and CW took 
photographs of Ibarra for the advertisements. Each of the 
advertisements indicated that it was for a “two-girl special.” 
Calls from potential cust omers would go to Ibarra and CW’s cell 
phones individually . CW came to Hawaiʻi with two cell phones and 
had control over both at all times. CW testified that she set 
the prices for her own prostitution dates. Ibarra testified 
that she and CW would go on prostitution dates together for 
safety, but that she and CW would not engage in sexual acts with 
a customer together . CW testified that she and Ibarra 
participated in sexual acts together on “maybe two or three” 
prostitution dates. 
Ibarra testified that she and co -defendant Ferreira 
had an intermittent romantic relationship. Ibarra explained 
that they broke up in mid-September of 2017 when Ferreira 
discovered that Ibarra engages in prostitution, and that they 
were not “boyfriend, girlfriend” at the time of th e trip to 
Hawaiʻi.

   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Ferreira joined Ibarra and CW in Hawaiʻi on November 3, 
2017. CW testified that between October 31 and November 2, it 
was her choice to answer her phone , to make dates, set prices, 
and engage in sexual acts for money . CW further testified that 
she was not scared of Ibarra and that she had a good time in 
Hawaiʻi when it was just her and Ibarra . However, CW stated that 
“the vibe chang[ed]” when Ferreira arrived.5 
CW testified that before Ferreira arrived, she gave 
Ibarra all of the money that she made from engaging in 
prostitution activities because “[n]ot only did [Ibarra] ask, 
but it only felt right because [Ibarra] had paid [CW’s] way to 
come to Hawaiʻi.”6 After Ferreira arrived, CW testified that she 
gave all of t he money that she made from prostitution activities 
directly to Ferreira. According to Ibarra, Ibarra told CW that 
Ibarra would front the costs of the trip , and that CW “would 
just pay [Ibarra] back once [CW] made the money.” Ibarra 
further testified that CW did not give Ibarra mon ey that CW made 
5 CW testified that she witnessed Fe rreira “slapping [Ibarra] 
around” a few times and “slamming her on the ground ” while in Hawaiʻi. Ibarra 
testified that Ferreira never hit her. 
CW also stated that there was “more pressure” to go on prostitution 
dates after Ferreira arrived, but “[n]ot necessarily force.” 
6 The dissent states that “CW attested that though there was no 
agreement, she paid Ibarra because she felt obligated. ” It is important to 
note that it was not Ibarra’s behavior that made CW feel obligated to repay 
her. Rather, CW testified that if she chose no t to repay Ibarra , she would 
have “[b]een greedy” and that she “gave [Ibarra] the money because [she] 
thought that was right [.]”

from prostitution activities “[o]ther than what...our 
arrangement was[.]” 
3. Verdict 
On October 22, 2018, t he jury returned a verdict of 
guilty against Ibarra for the lesser included offense of 
promoting prostitution in violation o f HRS § 712 -1203(1). The 
jury found Ferreira not guilty on all charges. 
4. Ibarra’s Motion for Judgment of Acquittal, or in 
the alternative, Motion for New Trial Is Denied 
On October 30, 2018, Ibarra filed a motion for 
judgment of acquittal, or in the alternative, a motion for new 
trial. As noted, i n order to be convicted of promoting 
prostitution under HRS § 712 -1203(1), a person must “knowingly 
advance[] or profit[] from prostitution.” Ibarra a rgued that 
she cannot be convicted of promoting prostitu tion under HRS § 
712-1203 because she neither advanced nor profited from CW’s 
prostitution. 
Ibarra noted that the definition of “advance s 
prostitution” in HRS § 712 -1201(1) excludes a person that is 
“acting as a prostitute” themself from being found gui lty. 
Ibarra argued that she was acting as a prostitute herself at all 
times, and thus cannot be convicted of advancing the 
prostitution of CW. That is, “[t]he taking of the photographs, 
the preparation of advertisements [], the posting of the   
 
 
 7  
  
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
   
 
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
advertiseme nts [], the accompaniment on the prostitution dates, 
[and] the prostitution dates all involved [] Ibarra, as well as 
CW [], acting as prostitutes.” 
Ibarra also contended that she did not “profit from 
prostitution” as defined in HRS § 712 -1201(2) because the money 
she received from CW was for reimbursement only. 
Finally, Ibarra pointed to the legislative history of 
HRS §§ 712-1201 and 712 -1203 reflecting that the legislature was 
intending to target those who benefit the most from 
prostitution, such as sex traffickers and pimps, not prostitutes 
themselves. Ibarra noted t hat CW “confirmed that she 
voluntarily and willingly engaged in prostitution , . . . that 
Ibarra did not use force, threats, fraud or intimidation” and 
that CW “never told Ibarra that she did not want to engage in 
prostitution[.]” 
The circuit court denied Ibarra’s motion for judgment 
of acquittal, or in the alternative, motion for new trial. The 
circuit court agreed that Ibarra was barred from conviction for 
promoting prostitution unde r the “advancement” alternative 
pursuant to HRS § 712 -1201(1). The circuit court concluded that 
“the definition of advances prostitution ” exempts from 
conviction “those acting as prostitutes [.]” In light of the 
evidence adduced at trial, the circuit court found that “no 
reasonable juror could have found that [Ibarra] did not fall   
 
 
  
 
8   
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
   
   
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
within the statutory exception ” because Ibarra herself was 
acting as a prostitute at all times that she was advancing CW’s 
prostitution. 
However, the circuit court found that a reasonable 
juror could find Ibarra guilty of promoting prostitution under 
the “profit” alternative pursuant to HRS § 712 -1201(2). 
Specifically , the circuit court held that a reasonable juror 
“could have found that [Ibarra] and [CW] had an agreement or 
understanding that [CW] would pay [Ibarra] back for any airfare 
and/or half of the hotel room costs.” The circuit court also 
found that a reasonable juror could have concluded that Ibarra 
knew the money paid to her by CW was from CW’s prostitution 
activiti es, personally rendered by CW and not by Ibarra. Under 
this analysis , the circuit court concluded that the jury found 
Ibarra guilty of promoting prostitution under the “profit” 
alternative and denied Ibarra’s motion for judgment of acquittal 
or in the alt ernative, motion for new trial. 
5. Judgment of Conviction 
On September 11, 2019, the circuit court entered its 
judgment of conviction. Ibarra was sentenced to a five -year 
term of probation and required to register as a sex offender 
pursuant to HRS § 846E-1.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
B. ICA Proceedings 
On appeal , the ICA affirmed Ibarra’s conviction in a 
Summary Disposition Order (“SDO”) filed May 27, 2022 . The ICA 
found that substantial evidence support ed the finding that 
Ibarra profited from prostitution because Ibarra t estified that 
she and CW had an agreement that CW would pay money to Ibarra 
that CW earned by rendering services as a prostitute. The ICA 
explained that “profits from prostitution” in HRS § 712 -1201(2) 
is not defined in the financial accounting sense of profit, but 
rather, a defendant “profits from prostitution ” if they 
“accept[] or receive[] money ” other than for prostitution 
services the defendant personally renders. 
C. Supreme Court Proceedings 
Ibarra filed a timely application for writ of 
certiora ri, contending that she could not have profited from 
prostitution where CW simply paid Ibarra back for CW’s airfare 
and CW’s share of the hotel room s. 
III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Sufficiency of the Evidence 
The test on appeal regarding sufficiency of the 
evidence is whether there is substantial evidence to support the 
conclusion of the trier of fact. See State v. Mattiello , 90 
Hawaiʻi 255, 259, 978 P.2d 693, 697 (1999) (internal citations 
omitted) . “Substantial evidence” is “credible evidence which i s   
 
 
 10    
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
   
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of 
reasonable caution to support a conclusion.” Id. (brackets and 
citations omitted). Additionally, “evidence adduced in the 
trial court must be considered in the strongest light for the 
prosecution when the appellate court passes on the legal 
sufficiency of such evidence to support a conviction.” Id. 
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). 
B. Statutory Interpretation 
“The interpretation of a statute is a question of law 
which th is court reviews de novo.” Labrador v. Liberty Mut. 
Group, 103 Hawaiʻi 206, 211, 81 P.3d 386, 391 (2003) (citations, 
internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted). 
IV. DISCUSSION 
A. To profit from prostitution within the meaning of HRS § 
712-1201(2), a defendant must obtain value, or benefit 
from, another’s prostitution activity 
Ibarra was convicted of promoting prostitution in 
violation of HRS § 712-1203(1), which provides that “[a] person 
commits the offense of promoting prostitution if the person 
knowingly advances or profits from prostitution.” (emphasis 
added). HRS § 712 -1201(1) defines what constitutes “advanc[ing] 
prostitution”: 
[a] person “advances prostitution” if, acting other than as a 
prostitute or a patron of a prostitute , the person kn owingly 
causes or aids a person to commit or engage in prostitution, 
procures or solicits patrons for prostitution, provides persons 
for prostitution purposes, permits premises to be regularly used 
for prostitution purposes, operates or assists in the oper ation 
of a house of prostitution or a prostitution enterprise, or   
 
 
 11  
   
 
 
 
 
    
 
  
 
 
   
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
engages in any other conduct designed to institute, aid, or 
facilitate an act or enterprise of prostitution.  
(emphasis added). In the order denying Ibarra’s motion for 
judgment of acquitta l, or in the alternative , for a new trial , 
the circuit court’s unchallenged finding of fact (“F OF”) No. 12 
states “that in all instances where [Ibarra] took action to 
advance prostitution[,] she herself was also acting as a 
prostitute” and thus, a reasonab le jury could not find Ibarra 
guilty of promoting prostitution under the “advancement” 
alternative. 
However, the circuit court concluded that a reasonable 
juror could find Ibarra guilty of promoting prostitution under 
the “profit” alternative . A person “profits from prostitution” 
if “acting other than as a prostitute receiving compensation for 
personally -rendered prostitution services, the person accepts or 
receives money or other property pursuant to an agreement or 
understanding with any person where by the person participates or 
is to participate in the proceeds of prostitution activity. ” 
HRS § 712 -1201(2). Despite the circuit court’s finding that 
Ibarra was merely paid back for expenses that she fronted, the 
circuit court held that reimbursement constitutes “profit[ing ]” 
within the meaning of the statute , because Ibarra knew that she 
was reimbursed from the proceeds of CW’s prostitution activity. 
The circuit court’s interpretation of “profits from 
prostitution” is overbroad because it d oes not account for the   
 
 
 12    
   
  
 
  
 
 
  
  
 
  
  
  
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
ordinary definition of the term “profit.” The ordinary meaning 
of the term “profit” in HRS § 712 -1201(2) is “a valuable 
return,” “gain” or “the excess of returns over expenditure in a 
transaction or series of transactions [.]” Profit, Merri am-
Webster, https://www.merriam -webster.com/dictionary/profit (last 
visited Dec. 8, 2022) . Put another way, a person “accept[ing] 
or receiv[ing] money or other property” must be benefitting or 
obtaining something of value, in order to come within the scope 
of the statute . HRS § 712 -1201(2). Otherwise, the term 
“profit” itself would be meaningless . Indeed, t here is no 
ordinary definition of “profit” which includes mere 
reimbursement. 
The legislative intent of HRS §§ 712 -1203 and 712 -1201 
supports interpreting the language “accepts or receives money or 
other property” in light of the plain meaning of “profit.” HRS 
§ 712-1201(2). When interpreting a statute, “[a] court may 
examine [] sources [other than the language itself], including a 
statute’s legislative history, in order to discern the 
underlying policy [that] the legislature sought to promulgate in 
the enactment of the statute. ” O’Grady v. State , 141 Hawaiʻi 26, 
28, 404 P.3d 292, 294 (2017) (citations and quotations omitted). 
As Ibarra points out, in the 2011 amendments to the statute, the 
legislature stated that the purpose was to target “those who 
benefit most from [] prostitution[,]” :   
 
 
 13  
 
    
    
 
  
  
 
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Your Committee fi nds that prostitution remains a concern within 
Hawaii communities, not only for the prostitution activity 
itself, but also for the criminal conduct that it can bring to 
the area within which it occurs. However, there are also concerns 
that some of those en gaged in prostitution are victims of human 
traffickers or others and are thus coerced into prostitution. 
Accordingly, it is incumbent on the State to craft legislation 
that combats those who benefit most from the prostitution, the 
traffickers and pimps , while providing protection to victims of 
traffickers who step forward seeking safety, and addresses the 
demand for prostitution by assuring that habitual patrons are 
penalized when they engage in this conduct. Your Committee 
believes that thoughtful legislat ion in those areas will act to 
protect those victimized by prostitution, including those coerced 
into prostitution and residents of sensitive communities that 
must grapple with the effects of prostitution and related 
criminal activities. 
Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1137 , in 2011 Senate Journal, at 1284-85. 
(emphases added) . Thus, the apparent legislat ive intent was to 
target those who benefit from prostitution without engaging in 
prostitution themselves ( e.g., pimps and sex traffickers) . 
Given the legislat ive intent to target those who 
“benefit most” from prostitution, a defendant who is merely 
reimbursed for expenses has not “profit[ed] from prostitution” 
within the intended meaning of HRS § 712-1201(2). The ordinary 
definition of the term “benefit” is “to be useful or profitable 
to” or “to receive help or an advan tage[.]” Benefit (verb) , 
Merriam-Webster, https://www.merriam -webster.com/dictionary / 
benefit (last visited Dec. 22, 2022). The circuit court’s 
unchallenged FOF No. 15 states that a reasonable juror could 
have found that there was an agreement or understanding only 
that CW would pay Ibarra “back for any airfare and/or half of 
the hotel room costs.” That is, Ibarra did not derive any   
 
 
 14   The phrase “agreement or understanding” in HRS § 712 -
1201(2) must also be interpreted  in light of the  plain meaning 
                                                             
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
benefit from CW’s prostitution activity ; reimbursement  is not 
“profitable” nor  does it constitute  an “advantage [.]”  Id.   
Rather, reimbursement is the simple act of paying someone back,  
and “implies a return of money that has been spent for another’s 
benefit.” Reimburse, Merriam -Webster, https://www.merriam-
webster.com/dictionary/reimburse  (last visited Dec. 22, 2022). 
Given that Ibarra was merely reimbursed, and derived no profit 
or benefit (i.e., did not receive any value or an advantage) 
from CW’s prostitution activities, the legislature did not 
intend Ibarra’s conduct to come within the scope of HRS § 712 -
1201(2).   7
7 The dissent cites to a comment to HRS § 712 -1204 (1972) , which is 
“functionally identical to the present HRS § 712 -1203[,]” to argue that 
Ibarra’s actions were like those of a taxi cab driver, bartender, or hotel 
clerk who engage in “small scale acts of trafficking that the provision was 
intended to target.” But the record is clear that unlike those small scale 
promoters, CW, not Ibarra, made the arrangements for CW's dates. The comment 
provides: 
This section strikes at the small scale promoter. The 
taxicab driver who pimps for a prostitute, the bartender 
who sets up customers for a prostitute, and the hotel clerk 
who regularly furnishes the prostitute and his or her 
customer with accommodations wo uld all come within the 
ambit of this provision. 
Ibarra’s conduct in the instant case is distinct from the listed examples. 
Ibarra did not “pimp” for CW, as did the taxicab driver . Ibarra did not set 
CW up with customers as did the bartender; CW answe red her own phone and set 
her own dates. And Ibarra did not arrange accommodations for CW to engage in 
prostitution like the hotel clerk ; CW made the arrangements for her own 
prostitution dates. CW answered “[y]es” when asked if it would “be fair to 
say…that when [she] would get either a call or text on [her] phone, that 
[she] would make the date arrangement [her]self.”

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
of the  term “profit”  and the legislature’s intent to target 
those who benefit most from prostitution without engaging in 
prostitution themselves. Ibarra and CW had an “understanding” 
that CW would reimburse  Ibarra for the airfare and hotel rooms, 
and Ibarra knew that she was reimbursed  from  the proceeds of 
CW’s prostitution activities .,   However,  there was no 98
8 The circuit court’s unchallenged FOF’s No. 15 and 16 state: 
15. In this case, based on the evidence adduced at trial, a 
reasonable juror could have found that the Defendant and 
complaining witness had an agreement or understanding that the 
complaining witness would pay the Defendant back for any airfare 
and/or half of the hotel room costs. 
16. In this case, based on the evidence addu ced at trial, a 
reasonable juror could have further found that Defendant knew 
that the money paid to the Defendant by the complaining witness 
arose from the complaining witness’s prostitution activities . 
Thus, the circuit court did not find that Ibarra an d CW had an “agreement or 
understanding” that CW was to specifically reimburse Ibarra with the proceeds 
of CW’s prostitution activity. Rather, the circuit court found that CW and 
Ibarra had a general agreement or understanding that CW would pay Ibarra bac k 
for the airfare and half of the hotel room costs, and that Ibarra knew, after 
the fact , that the money CW used to reimburse Ibarra was from the proceeds of 
CW’s prostitution activity. 
9 The dissent states “that there was a pre -existing agreement that 
CW would repay [Ibarra] from the proceeds of [CW’s] dates” and it was “within 
the province of the jury to credit Ibarra’s testimony and find there was such 
an understanding.” However, as noted above ( supra n. 8), the circuit court’s 
FOF’s No. 15 and 16 st ate only that (i) there was an agreement that CW was to 
reimburse Ibarra for fronting the costs of the trip to Hawaiʻi and (ii) that 
Ibarra knew, after the fact, that she was reimbursed from the proceeds of 
CW’s prostitution activity. These findings were not challenged on appeal, 
and thus “are binding on the appellate court.” Okada Trucking Co. v. Bd. of 
Water Supply , 97 Hawaiʻi 450, 458, 40 P.3d 73, 81 (2002); see also Kawamata 
Farms v. United Agri Prods. , 86 Hawaiʻi 214, 252, 948 P.2d 1055, 1093 (1997) 
(defendants “have waived any challenge regarding the findings of fact that 
support the circuit court’s denial of the ir motion for a new trial[.]”). 
Assuming arguendo that this court could disregard FOF ’s No. 15 and 16, an 
agreement requires “[a] mutual understanding between two or more persons 
about their relative rights and duties[.]” Agreement, Black’s Law Dictionar y

she would repay Ibarra. Accordingly, there was no mutual understanding

“agreement or understanding” that Ibarra was to benefit (i.e., 
gain value or an advantage) from CW’s prostitution activity. 
Interpreting the language “agreemen t or understanding” in light 
of the associated term “profit s” requires that there must be an 
“agreement or understanding” that the defendant will indeed 
benefit or gain value from another’s prostitution activity. See 
Advertiser Publishing Co. v. Fase , 43 Haw. 154, 161, (1959) 
(“There is a rule of construction embodying the words noscitur a 
sociis which may be freely translated as ‘words of a feather 
flock together, ’ that is, the meaning of a word is to be judged 
by the company it keeps. ”). The State did n ot prove that Ibarra 
and CW had an agreement or understanding whereby Ibarra was to 
gain value or benefit from CW’s prostitution activity. 
The interpretation of “profits from prostitution” 
relied upon by the circuit court and the ICA would broaden the 
scope of the statute beyond the meaning intended by the 
legislature .10 The legislature explicitly intended to craft 
. . . continued 
between Ibarra and CW that CW was going to reimburse Ibarra from “the 
proceeds of [CW’s] prostitution activ ity[,]” as required by HRS § 712-
1201(2). Thus, even under the dissent’s interpretation, where HRS §§ 712 -
1201(2) and 712 -1203 penalize “any agreement or understanding to receive the 
proceeds of another person’s prostitution activities[,]” Ibarra’s conduc t 
does not fall within the scope of the statute . 
10 Ibarra notes that if her conduct falls within the scope of HRS § 
712-1201(2), then if CW paid Ibarra back for a pack of gum, it would 
constitute “profiting from prostitution” as well. The dissent dismisses this 
argument, contending that it “ignores the language specifying that the

legislation targeting only “those who benefit most from the 
prostitution” and not prostitutes themselves. Stand. Com m. Rep. 
No. 1137 , in 2011 Senate Journal, at 1284-85. (emphasis added) . 
Accordingly, the State failed to prove that Ibarra “profit[ed] 
,12 from prostitution,” within the meaning of HRS § 712 -1201(2). 11
. . . continued 
receipt of money must be “pursuant to an agreement or understanding.” ” The 
fact that “there must be a preexisting agreement or understanding wherein 
both parti es agree that one party will engage in prostitution and that some 
or all of the proceeds will go to the other party” does not refute the point . 
As an example, person X and person Y are long -time friends that both engage 
in prostitution. X does not have m oney for lunch, so Y agrees to pay for X’s 
meal, pursuant to an understanding that X will reimburse Y from the proceeds 
of the prostitution date that X independently scheduled for later that day . 
Under the dissent’s interpretation of HRS § 712 -1201(2), Y would be guilty of 
promoting prostitution. 
11 The dissent asserts that interpreting HRS § 712 -1201(2) to 
require the defendant obtain value from another’s prostitution activity risks 
creating a safe harbor for traffickers. Specifically, the dissent st ates 
that sex traffickers may provide funds or assistance, which the victim agrees 
to repay, but if “the loan proves prohibitively difficult to repay, [] the 
victim is trapped in a coercive dynamic.” However, because the criminal 
conduct the dissent is co ncerned would receive safe harbor protection is 
criminalized elsewhere in Hawaiʻi law, there is no such safe harbor created 
for traffickers who provide coercive loans to victims. HRS § 712 -1203, for 
example, provides that a person is guilty of “promoting prostitution” if they 
“advance[] prostitution” or “profit[] from prostitution.” Under the 
advancement alternative, a person is guilty if the person “knowingly causes 
or aids a person to commit or engage in prostitution, procures or solicits 
patrons for prostitution, provides persons for prostitution purposes, permits 
premises to be regularly used for prostitution purposes, operates or assists 
in the operation of a house of prostitution, or a prostitution enterprise, or 
engages in any conduct designed to institute, aid or facilitate an act or 
enterprise of prostitution.” HRS § 712 -1202(1) also provides that a person 
is guilty of sex trafficking if they knowingly advance prostitution “by 
compelling or inducing a person by force, threat, fraud, coercion, or 
intimidation to engage in prostitution[.]” Thus, the dissent’s concern about 
creating a safe harbor is not a reason to contradict legislative intent and 
criminalize reimbursement between friends from funds gained from 
prostitution. 
Moreover, the dissent’s interpretation, which would seemingly result in 
finding that a person is guilty of profiting from prostitution where they are 
knowingly reimbursed from the proceeds of another’s prostitution activity, risks criminalizing the conduct of those like Ibarra, in cases where “the

V. CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, the ICA’s June 20, 2022 
judgment on appeal, the circuit court’s September 11, 2019 
judgment of conviction , and the circuit court’s October 21, 2019 
order denying Ibarra’s motion for judgment of acquittal, are 
reversed .

equities” do not favor conviction, as the circuit court ex plicitly 
acknowledged. Convicting Ibarra of promoting prostitution because she 
received funds for reimbursement of a personal debt from a friend who earned 
the money as a prostitute, and requiring her to register as a sex offender 
serves no public safety purpose, but limits her professional opportunities 
and makes it more likely that she will continue to engage in prostitution. 
Adopting the dissent’s interpretation could lead to the criminalization of 
landlords, personal friends, retail establishments, gr ocery stores and day 
care centers who receive money from people – including single parents — if 
they believe the money was earned through prostitution. The legislature did 
not intend to so cripple the welfare of those seeking to survive through 
prostituti on. 
12 Ibarra also contends that the circuit court erred in failing to 
ensure that Ibarra’s waiver of her right not to testify was knowing, 
intelligent and voluntary. The ICA was correct to conclude that the circuit 
court was not required to engage Ibar ra in a Tachibana colloquy prior to her 
testimony. State v. Lewis , 94 Hawaiʻi 292, 296, 12 P.3d 1233, 1237 (2000) 
held that an ultimate Tachibana colloquy is not required in cases where the 
defendant testifies. Although State v. Torres , 144 Hawaiʻi 282, 285, 439 P.3d 
234, 237 (2019) held that a Tachibana colloquy must be given i n all trials, 
including where a defendant testifies, this requirement was imposed 
prospectively only. Because Torres was decided after Ibarra’s trial, Lewis 
is controlling, and the circuit court was not required to engage Ibarra in a 
Tachibana colloquy.
