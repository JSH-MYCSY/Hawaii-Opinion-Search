OPINION OF THE COURT BY WILSON, J.  
Petitioner/ Defendant -Appellant Joshua Yamashita 
(“Yamashita”) was convicted of various drug, theft , fraud, and 
property crim es in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit 
(“circuit court”) .1 At sentencing , in addition to a five -year

term of incarceration, Yamashita was ordered to pay a crime 
victim compensation (“CVC”) fee under Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes 
(“HRS”) §§ 706-605(6) (S upp. 2018) and 351 -62.6 (2015) and a 
drug demand reduction (“DDR”) assessment under HRS § 706-650 
(Supp. 2018) . He objected to imposition of the CVC fee because 
he was presently unable to pay and would not be able to pay the 
CVC fee in the future . He also contended both the CVC fee and 
DDR assessment amounted to unconstitutional taxes. The 
Intermediate Court of Appeals (“ICA”) affirmed the circuit 
court’s imposition of the CVC fee and DDR assessment , finding 
there was substantial evidence that Yamashita would be able to 
pay the CVC fee in the future and that the CVC fee and DDR 
assessment were constitutional fines , not unconstitutional 
taxes . 
The ICA’s judgment on appeal is affirmed except as to 
the issue of Yam ashita’s ability to pay the CVC fee. His 
present inability to pay the CVC fee mandated waiver of the fee 
pursuant to HRS §§ 706-605(6) and 351 -62.6 . 
II. BACKGROUND 
A. Circuit Court Proceedings 
In August 2017, Yamashita pleaded no contest in Case 
No. 2CPC -17-0000133 (the “First Case”) to one cou nt of 
unauthorized control of a propelled vehicle in violation of HRS

§ 708-836;  Yamashita was sentenced to four years  of probation 
and ordered to pay restitution and fees.  
Between November 20, 2017 and October 30, 2018, 
Yamashita was charged  in seven othe r cases (the “Other Cases”) 
and subsequently pleaded  no contest to drug, theft, fraud, and 
property crimes in the circuit court.   Under the plea agreement 
for  the Other Cases, Yamashita also admitted to violating the 
terms and conditions of probation in the First Case. On May 31, 
2019, the circuit court held a sentencing hearing for the Other Cases, and a resentencing hearing for the First Case. The 
circuit court entered a judgment on the Other Cases convicting  
and sentencing Yamashita  to a term of incarceration of five 
years for each felony, one year for each misdemeanor, and thirty 
days for each petty misdemeanor, to be served concurrently. The 
circuit court also ordered Yamashita  to pay  $1,810.00  in court 2
2 In November 2018, Yamashita entered into a plea agree ment under 
which he pleaded no contest to twenty -six other counts in seven other cases 
(Case Nos. 2CPC -17-0000905 , 2CPC -17-0000986 , 2CPC -18-0000321 , 2CPC -18-
0000215 , 2CPC -18-0000632 , 2CPC -18-0000792 , 2CPC -18-0000828 ), including: two 
counts of unauthorized control of a propelled vehicle in violation of HRS § 
708-836; two counts of unauthorized entry into motor vehicle in the first 
degree in violation of HRS § 708 -836.5; five counts of theft in the second 
degree in violation of HRS § 708 -831; two counts of t heft in the third degree 
in violation of HRS § 708 -832; two counts of theft in the fourth degree in 
violation of HRS § 708 -833; one count of criminal property damage in the 
third degree in violation of HRS § 708-822; two counts of criminal property 
damage in the fourth degree in violation of HRS § 708-823; two counts of 
unauthorized possession of confidential personal information in violation of 
HRS § 708-839.55 ; four counts of theft of credit card in violation of HRS § 
708-8102; two counts of fraudulent us e of a credit card in violation of HRS § 
708-8100; one count of promoting a dangerous drug in the third degree in 
violation of HRS § 712 -1243; and one count of prohibited acts related to drug

§§ 706-605(6) and 351-62.6 ,3 a $2,500.00 internet crimes against 
children (“ ICAC”) fee,4 and a $100 .00 DDR assessment under HRS 
3 HRS § 706-605(6 ) provides, in relevant part: 
The court shall impose a compensation fee upon every person convicted 
of a criminal offense pursuant to section 351 -62.6; provided that the court 
shall waive the imposition of a compensation fee if it finds that the 
defendant is unable to pay the compensation fee. 
HRS § 351-62.6 provides: 
(a)  The court shall impose a compensation fee upon every defendant who 
has been convicted or who has entered a plea under section 853 -1 and who is 
or will be able to pay the compensation fee. The amount of the compensation 
fee shall be commensurate with the seriousness of the offense as follows: 
(1) Not less than $105 nor more than $505 for a felony; 
(2) $55 for a misdemeanor ; and 
(3) $30 for a petty misdemeanor. 
The compensation fee shall be separ ate from any fine that may be 
imposed under section 706 -640 and shall be in addition to any other 
disposition under this chapter; provided that the court shall waive the 
imposition of a compensation fee if the defendant is unable to pay the 
compensation fe e. Moneys from the compensation fees shall be deposited into 
the crime victim compensation special fund under section 351 -62.5. 
(b) The criteria of section 706 -641 may apply to this section. In 
setting the amount of the compensation fee to be imposed, t he court shall 
consider all relevant factors, including but not limited to: 
(1) The seriousness of the offense; 
(2) The circumstances of the commission of th e offense; 
(3) The economic gain, if any, realized by th e defendant; 
(4) The number of victims; a nd 
(5) The defendant ’s earning capacity, including future earning capacity. 
(c) The compensation fee shall be considered a civil judgment. 
4 In addition to a CVC fee and DDR assessment, t he circuit court 
also originally imposed an ICAC fee pursuant to HRS § 846F -3 (2014 ), which 
provides in relevant part that “[t] he court shall order every defendant to 
pay an [ICAC] fee of up to $100 for each felony or misdemeanor conviction; 
provided that no fee shall be ordered when the court determines that the 
defend ant is unable to pay the fee .” HRS § 846F -3(a). However, t he circuit 
court ultimately found that Yamashita was presently unable to pay and waived 
the ICAC fee.

§ 706-650.5 The circuit court then entered an Order of 
Resentencing in the First Case whereby Yamashita ’s probation was 
revoked;  he was resentenced to serve five years of incarceration 
(. . . continued) 
Further, w e note that with respect to the Other Cases, t he 
circuit court’s May 31, 20 19 judg ment levied an ICAC fee totaling $ 2,500.00 
(25 counts each received a n ICAC fee of $100.00, for a total ICAC fee of 
$2,500.00 ). However, the judgment contains a typographical error that states 
the total ICAC fee is $ 2,100.00 . This typographical error appears to have 
impacted some court proceedings and party submissions. The correct amount of 
the ICAC fee imposed with respect to the Other Cases is $ 2,500.00. 
5 HRS § 706-650 provides, in relevant part: 
(1) In addition to any disposition authorized by chapter 706 or 853, 
any person who is: 
(a) Convicted of an offense under part IV of chapter 712, except 
sections 712 -1250.5 and 712 -1257; 
shall be ordered to pay a monetary assessment under subsection (2), 
except as provided under subsection (5) . 
Notwithstanding sections 706 -640 and 706 -641 and any other law to the 
contrary, the assessments provided by this section shall be in addition to 
and not in lieu of, and shall not be used to offset or reduce, any fine 
authorized or required by l aw and shall be paid pursuant to section 706 -651. 
(4) All monetary assessments paid and interest accrued on 
funds collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited into the drug 
demand reduction assessments special fund. 
(5) If the court det ermines that the person has the ability to pay the 
monetary assessment and is eligible for probation or will not be sentenced to 
incarceration, unless otherwise required by law, the court may order the 
person to undergo a substance abuse treatment program at the person ’s 
expense. If the person undergoes a substance abuse treatment program at the 
person’s expense, the court may waive or reduce the amount of the monetary 
assessment. Upon a showing by the person that the person lacks the financial 
ability to pay all or part of the monetary assessment, the court may waive or 
reduce the amount of the monetary assessment.

with credit for time served (to be served concurrently with the 
sentences in the Other Cases) and ordered to pay $1,000 in 
restitution, a $105 CVC fee, and a $100 ICAC fee. 
Taking t he First Case and the Other Cases together , 
Yamashita was sentenced to financial penalties totaling $1,810 
in fines , $9,767.20  in restitution , a $2,180 CVC fee , a $2,600 
ICAC fee , and a $100 DDR assessment.6 
The circuit court ordered that Yamashita  pay,  in  order:  
restitution, the CVC fee, the ICAC fee,  the DDR assessment, and
the fines  at the rate of twenty-five percent of gross earnings  
while incarcerated, then at a rate of at least $30.00 per month 
upon his release. At sentencing, Yamashita  requested a  waiver 
of the CVC fee  and  the circuit court set an evidentiary hearing
to determine his  ability to pay  and whether his request for a 
waiver of the CVC fee should be granted.  7  
6 We note that Yamashita’s appeal encompasses all eight of his 
circuit court cases to which he was sentenced and/or resentenced on May 31, 
2019 (the First Case, along with the Other Cases) . However, some court 
proceedings and most party submissions in the record refer only to the $2,075 
CVC fee and the $2,500 ICAC fee levied in the Other Cases . This opinion 
treats the CVC fee at issue as one combined CVC fee as levied across all 
eight cases, in the amount of $ 2,180.00  (the $2,075.00 CVC fee from the Other 
Cases, plus the $105.00 CVC fee from the First Case ). Additionally, this 
opinion treats the ICAC fee at issue as one combined ICAC fee in t he amount 
of $ 2,600.00 (the $2,500 ICAC fee from the Other Cases, plus the $100.00 ICAC 
fee from the First Case) . Further proceedings consistent with this opinion 
shall use these same combined amounts for the CVC fee ($2,180.00 ) and the 
ICAC fee ($2,600.0 0). 
7 Yamashita does not argue before this court that the circuit court 
abused its discretion in imposing a DDR assessment, but does contend that the 
DDR assessment is an unconstitutional tax. Thus, the DDR assessment will 
only be discussed in the cont ext of Yamashita’s constitutional arguments.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
In support of his request for a waiver of the CVC fee, 
Yamashita filed a motion to reconsider all of his sentences 
across the First Case and the Other Case s (“Motion to Reconsider 
Sentence” ) asking the court to waive the CVC fee because he was 
unable to pay it . Yamashita reli ed on Haw. Insurers Council v. 
Lingle , 120 Hawaiʻi 51, 59, 201 P.3d 564, 572 (2008 ) in argu ing 
that the CVC fee and DDR assessment were unconstitutional taxes 
given the constitutional principle that only the legislative 
branch of government has the authority to tax . He argued that 
the CVC fee and DDR a ssessment were not constitutionally 
permissible user fees , paid “in exchange for a particular 
governmental service which benefits the party paying the fee 
. . . to compensate the governmental entity providing the 
services for its expenses [,]” but rather, w ere taxes “imposed by 
the government on persons, entities, transactions, or property 
to yield public revenue [,]” which may not be delegated by the 
legislature. Lingle , 120 Hawaiʻi at 6 0, 62, 201 P.3d at 57 3, 575 
(internal quotation marks omitted ). Yamashita contend ed that t o 
determine whether a charge is a user fee, as opposed to a tax , 
the court should apply the three -part test in Lingle , 120 Hawaiʻi 
at 62, 201 P.3d at 575 , which consider s whether the charge “(1) 
applies to the direct beneficiary of a particular service , (2) 
is allocated directly to defraying the costs of providing the 
service , and (3) is reasonably proportionate to the benefit

received.” Under the Lingle test, Yamashita argued that the CVC 
fee and DDR assessment were unconstitutional tax es because they 
were set and collected at the court’s discretion, primarily, “to 
generate revenue .” 
The circuit court held an evidentiary hearing to 
assess Yamashita’s ability to pay the CVC fee and t o determine 
whether he should be granted a waiver of said fee. At the 
hearing, Yamashita testified that he was twenty -nine years old 
and had a GED. He testified that , prior to incarceration, he 
was “on the streets,” and his last non-prison job was as a 
roofer . Yamashita testified that he was currently incarcerated 
at Halawa Correctional Facility (“HCF”) and was employed at HCF 
as a plumber . He confirmed that he had not been trained as a 
plumber, but “learned on the job.” Yamash ita testified that as 
a plumber he made twenty -five cents an hour and worked about 
thirty -five hours a week , which averaged to about $15.00 to 
$20.00 per month in prison income . He also stated that his 
mother sometimes put $100 .00 per month in his HCF acc ount , when 
she was able to . He testified that $30.00 per month was 
automatically removed from his account by the “[c]ourt” and that 
his HCF account was currently empty. He claimed that he had no 
other sources of income and had no investments or assets. He 
stated that he had two daughters and paid $100 .00 in child 
support every month. Yamashita testified that he had no medical            
 
 9  
 
 
 
  
   
 
 
  
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
issues , and that he could get a full -time job and intended to 
work to support himself and his daughter s and to pay off his 
financ ial obligations upon release from prison . Yamashita 
testified that he was presently unable to pay the CVC fee, but 
agreed that if he became employed post -incarceration , it would 
be “feasible” for him to pay $30.00 per month after his release . 
After the evidentiary hearing to assess Yamashita’s 
ability to pay the CVC fee, t he circuit court filed an order on 
January 15, 2020 granting in part and denying in part 
Yamashita ’s Motion to Reconsider Sentence , and denying 
Yamashita’s request for a waiver of the CVC fee . Based on 
Yamashita’s testimony, in its Findings of Fact (“FOFs”) and 
Conclusions of Law (“COLs”) , the circuit court concluded that 
Yamashita was “healthy, young, ha[d] his GED, [wa]s able -bodied, 
and [wa]s willing and able to find employment afte r release from 
custody.” The circuit court found that “Defendant’s plumbing 
job at Halawa will provide him with training and a skillset that
will allow him to become gainfully employed outside of prison.”  
Thus, the circuit court determined that  because Yamashita had 
“skills as a plumber, was employed at his evidentiary hearing, 
and ha[d]  the ability to become employed in the future,” paying 
$30.00 per month post-incarceration  “would be feasible”  and he 
would  “eventually be able to pay” his financial obligations, 
“including his CVC fees .”

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
As to  Yamashita’s constitutional claims, the circuit 
court concluded that because the CVC fee and DDR assessment were 
expended for “legitimate criminal justice purposes, ”  both 
charges were constitutional.    8 
B. Appellate Proc eedings 
1. ICA Appeal 
Yamashita argued  in his appeal to the ICA that the  
circuit  court erred in denying his  Motion  to Reconsider 
Sentence .9 He first posited that the circuit court erroneously 
“concluded that it must consider [his] future earning capacity” 
when imposing the CVC fee, and contended  that future earning 
capacity was only relevant to the amount of the CVC fee under 
HRS § 351-62.6(b) .10 The State denied that the circuit court 
8 In support of its finding that the CVC fee and DDR assessment 
were constitutional, t he circuit court relied on a “framework” adopted by a 
Texas appeals court wherein a court cost was constitutional if it wa s 
“expended for legitimate criminal justice purposes .” Peraza v. State , 467 
S.W.3d 508, 517 (Tex. Crim. App. 2015 ). According to Peraza , “[a] criminal 
justice purpose is one that relates to the administration of our criminal 
justice system. Whether a cr iminal justice purpose is ‘legitimate ’ is a 
question to be answered on a statute -by-statute/case -by-case basis.” Id. at 
517-18. Under the Texas framework, the circuit court found that CVC funds 
were expended for a legitimate criminal justice purpose, nam ely, “ to provide 
financial aid to victims of crimes ,” and thus, concluded that HRS § 351 -
62.5(b) was not unconstitutional. The circuit court found that DDR funds 
were also expended for a legitimate criminal justice purpose, namely, “to 
supplement substanc e abuse treatment and other substance abuse demand 
reduction programs [,]” and thus, concluded that HRS § 706 -650 was not 
unconstitutional. 
9 Yamashita specifically challenged the circuit court’s COLs Nos. 
4–5, 10, 13, 15, 17 –19, and 22 –23. 
10 Yamashi ta noted that even if the court could consider future 
earning capacity, the circuit court’s “highly speculative assumption” that he            
 
 11   The ICA issued  a Summary Disposition Order (“SDO”)  
affirming the circuit court’s Order  of Resentencing, Judgments 
of Conviction, and Reconsideration Order. In affirming the 
circuit court’s imposition  of the CVC fee,  the  ICA reasoned that 
the circuit court’s unchallenged findings established that  
Yamashita would be able to pay the CVC fee in the future because  
 
 
 
 
                     
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
abused  its discretion by imposing a CVC fee  and argued that the 
“most reasonable and consistent reading” of HRS §§  706-605(6) 
and 351-62.6(a) together permitted consideration of a 
defendant’s future ability to pay CVC fee s. Yamashita responded
that this interpretation of the statutes did not  align with 
legislative intent: “protecting the indigent” from having to 
pay a CVC fee.   
Yamashita voluntarily applied for his plumbing job at 
Halawa because he wanted to work; the p lumbing job will 
provide him with training and a skillset that will allow 
him to become gainfully employed outside of prison; he was 
in good health and faced no kind of medical issue that 
would prevent him from working; and he intended to work 
full -time on ce released from prison or placed on parole to 
support his two daughters and pay his court -ordered 
restitution, fines, and fees. 
Given this evidence, the  ICA concluded that the circuit court ’s 
finding that Yamashita would  be able to pay the CVC fee was not 
clearly erroneous.  
(. . . continued) 
would be able to pay the CVC fee in the future was “not supported by the 
evidence” and was not reasonably foreseeable.            
 
 12  
 
 
  
   
   
   
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
As to Yamashita’s constitutional argument , the ICA 
found that the CVC fee and DDR assessment were constitutional 
criminal fines, citing its decision in State v. Adcock , 148 
Hawaiʻi 308, 320 –21, 473 P.3d 769, 781 –82 (App. 2020) , where it 
held that “the CVC fee is a fine, not a tax ,” because (1) “it is 
a penalty imposed after a criminal conviction[;]” (2) “it 
is  .  .  . paid into a special fund in the state treasury that 
does not reimburse payments related to the defendant’s 
prosecution[; ]” and (3) “it makes the severity of the crime a 
criterion to be considered when the court orders the payment.”   
The ICA reasoned that the “same analysis” applied  to the DDR 
assessment  in the present case.   Thus, the ICA upheld the 
constitutionality of both  the CVC fee and  DDR assessment.  
2. Application for Writ of Certiorari 
Yamashita filed a timely application for writ of 
certiorari on March 1, 2021 . In his application, Yamashita 
argued that the ICA gravely erred by (1) affirming the circuit 
court’s dete rmination that he would be able to pay the $2,180 
CVC fee; and (2) declining to apply the three -part test in State 
v. Medeiros , 89 Hawaiʻi 361, 973 P.2d 736 (1999), to determine 
whether the CVC fee and DDR assessment were unconstitutional 
taxes. Yamashita’s application for writ of certiorari was 
accepted .

III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law 
This court revie ws the circuit court’s FOFs “under the 
clearly erroneous standard.” 7’s Enters . v. Del Rosario , 111 
Hawaiʻi 484 , 489, 143 P.3d 23, 28 (2006). 
A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when, despite 
evidence to support the finding, the appellate court is 
left with the definite and firm conviction in reviewing the 
entire evidence that a mistake has been committed. A 
finding of fact is also clearly erroneous when the record 
lacks substantial evidence to support the finding. We have 
defined substantial evidenc e as credible evidence which is 
of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a 
person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion. 
Id. COLs are reviewed de novo under the right/wrong standard.

IV. DISCUSSION 
A. The Circuit Court Erred by Imposing a CVC Fee on Yamashita 
Pursuant to HRS §§ 706 -605 and 351 -62.6 Because He Was 
Unable to Pay the CVC Fee 
The ICA erred by affirming  the circuit court’s 
imposition of a CVC fee  pursuant to HRS §§ 706-605 and 351-62.6  
because  Yamashita was  presently unable to pay the fee.   The 
issue in the present case is whether the court, in imposing a 
CVC fee, should have considered only Yamashita’s present ability 
to pay , or whether it was permitted to also consider his future 
ability to pay.   Resolution of this issue hinges on  the  
interpretation of HRS  §§ 706-605  and 351-62.6, both of which  
apply in the present case because they both  provide for the  
imposition of a CVC fee  on every convicted criminal defendant.   
We consider the following rules of statutory construction in 
interpreting their meaning:  11
First, legislative enactments are presumptively valid and 
should be interpreted in such a manner as to give them 
effect. S econd, laws in pari materia, or upon the same 
subject matter, shall be construed with reference to each 
other. What is clear in one statute may be called in aid 
to explain what is doubtful in another. Third, where there 
is a plainly irreconcilable confli ct between a general and 
a specific statute concerning the same subject matter, the 
specific will be favored. However, where the statutes 
simply overlap in their application, effect will be given 
to both if possible, as repeal by implication is 
disfavored .

Richardson v. City & County of Honolulu , 76 Hawaiʻi 46, 54–55, 
868 P.2d 1193, 1201 –02 (1994), reconsideration denied , 76 Hawaiʻi 
247, 871 P.2d 795 (1994), judgment aff’d , 124 F.3d 1150 (9th 
Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks, brackets, and citations 
omitted). 
Under the plain language of both HRS § § 706-605 and 
351-62.6 , the court must (1) impose a CVC fee on every convicted 
defendant and (2) waive the CVC fee if the defendant is 
presently unable to pay. HRS § 706 -605(6) provides that “[t]he 
court shall impose a [CVC] fee upon every person convicted o f a 
criminal offense pursuant to section 351 -62.6” but states that 
“the court shall waive the imposition of a [CVC] fee if it finds 
that the defendant is unable to pay the [CVC] fee. ” HRS § 351 -
62.6 (a) specifies that a CVC fee shall be imposed “upon every 
defendant who has been convicted or who has entered a plea under 
section 853 -1 and who is or will be able to pay the [CVC] fee ” 
but states, like HRS § 706 -605(6) , “that the court shall waive 
the imposition of a [CVC] fee if the defendant is unable to pay 
the [CVC] fee.” It is evident that both statutes mandate the 
imposition of a CVC fee and mandate waiver when a defendant is 
presently unable to pay . 
The plain language of HRS §§ 706-605 and 351 -62.6 , 
however, differs slightly as to under what circumstanc es the 
court should impose a CVC fee : HRS § 706-605(6) provides that a            
 
 16  
  
 
 
    
 
  
 
  
 
  
   
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
CVC fee shall be imposed on “every person convicted of a 
criminal offense” while HRS § 351-62.6(a) provides that a CVC 
fee shall be imposed on every defendant who has been convicted 
of or pleaded to a criminal offense and “ who is or will be able 
to pay” the fee. Thus , given this differing language, the issue 
is whether there is a “plainly irreconcilable conflict” between 
HRS §§ 706 -605(6) and 351 -62.6(a), or whether the two statutes 
“simply overlap in their application.” Id. at 55, 868 P.2d at 
1202. There is no “ plainly irreconcilable conflict” between the 
two statutes as both statutes overlap and provide that the court 
“shall waive” the CVC fee if “the defendant is unable to pay[.]” 
HRS §§ 706-605(6), 351 -62.6(a). Under both HRS §§ 706-605(6) 
and 351 -62.6 (a), if the court determines the defendant is 
presently unable to pay the CVC fee, the court is required to 
waive the fee and there is no need to determine whether the 
defendant “wi ll be able to pay” the fee under HRS § 351 -62.6(a). 
The legislative history of both statutes evinces the 
legislature’s intent to mandate waiver of CVC fee s when the 
defendant is presently unable to pay. The authority to impose 
CVC fees was established in 1998 by Act 206, which added now -HRS 
§ 351 -62.6 in its entirety and amended HRS § 706-605 to add a 
provision imposing CVC fee s. 1998 Haw. Sess. Laws 717. Neither 
Act 206 itself nor the legislature’s committee reports explain 
why HRS § 351 -62.6, but not H RS § 706-605, impose s a CVC fee on

a defendant who “will be able to pay.” The legislative history 
of Act 206 , however, clearly reflects the legislat ive intent 
that waiver of the CVC fee be mandatory, rather than 
discretionary , if a defendant is presently unable to pay.12 
Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 123, in 1998 House Journal, at 1003, 1998 
Senate Journal, at 796 –97 (amending the bill to require that the 
court waive the CVC fee if the defendant was unable to pay); 
Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 156, in 1998 House Journal, a t 1025–26, 
1998 Senate Journal, at 819 (same); H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 
894-98, in 1998 House Journal, at 1404 (same). Thus, the 
legislative history of HRS §§ 351 -62.6 and 706-605 supports an 
interpretation wherein the guiding inquiry in imposing a CVC fee 
is whether the defendant is presently able to pay such a fee. 
If not, the court is required to waive the fee. 
In this case, both the circuit court and the ICA 
emphasize d the language in HRS § 351 -62.6(a) that purports to 
impose a CVC fee on every defend ant “ who is or will be able to 
12 The Senate Committee on Judiciary was the only committee to posi t 
that CVC fee s should be discretionary instead of mandatory , voicing a 
“concern [] that requiring mandatory compensation [of CVC fee s] would

stating that “[j] udges should have the discretion not to impose compensation 
fees on a defendant who is unable to pay. ” H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 894 -98,

pay the [CVC] fee .”13 In its SDO, the ICA point ed to its holding 
in State v. Pulgados , 148 Hawaiʻi 361, 477 P.3d 155 (App. 2020), 
cert. denied , No. SCWC -19-0000577, 2021 WL 815862 (Mar. 3, 
2021), which stated that “a  sentencing court must impose CVC 
fees upon the satisfaction of two conditions:  (1) that the 
defendant has been convicted of a criminal offense, including a 
conviction upon a plea; and (2) a determination that the 
defendant is or will be able to pay the CVC fee. ” 148 Hawaiʻi at 
369, 477 P.3d at 163. However, imposing a CVC fee solely 
considering the two aforementioned conditions relied on by the 
ICA ignores the provisions in both HRS § § 351-62.6(a ) and 706-
605(6) that the court must waive the CVC fee when the defendant 
is presently unable to pay. Mandatory waiver where the 
defendant is presently unable to pay renders irrelevant whether 
a defendant may gain the ability to pay in the future. Thus , to 
the extent that the holding in Pulgados allows a court to impose 
a CVC fee on a defendant who is presently unable to pay , that 
holding is overruled. 
In the present case , the circuit court concluded that 
Yamashita was “presently unable to pay ICAC fees” given his 
“limited earning potential” in prison, his current prison 
13 In its COL No. 18, the circuit court found that “[a]s part of the 
CVC statute, the legislature included specific language that requires a 
judge’s contemplation of a defendant’s present and future abilities to pay.”

income, a nd his child support and restitution obligations, and 
waived the $2,600.00 ICAC fee.14 At the evidentiary hearing to 
determine whether Yamashita should be granted a waiver of the 
CVC fee , Yamashita testified that he h ad no assets or 
investments and no cons istent income other than the twenty -five 
cents an hour he earn ed from his HCF plumbing job.15 Yamashita 
also testified that he paid $100.00 per month in child support 
and that for every $100.00 accrued in his HCF account, $30.00 
was automatically withdrawn and applied toward his court -ordered 
financial obligations . 
Unlike its decision not to impose an ICAC fee, the 
circuit court made no finding as to Yamashita’s present ability 
to pay a CVC fee, concluding only that Yamashita was “willing 
and will eventuall y be able to pay the restitutions, fees, and 
fines, including his CVC fees.” However, the circuit court’s 
14 The circuit court’s COL No. 20 provided : 
The Court finds t hat, taking into account only [Yamashita]’s current 
ability to pay, he is unable to pay the $ [2,600] in ICAC fees. [Yamashita]’s 
current income while incarcerated does not cover his liabilities that include 
ICAC fees. All of [Yamashita]’s current income goes towards higher -ranking 
priorities such as his child support obligations and restitution in his 
cases. Even after his current income is garnished for those aforementioned 
liabilities, he still owes all payments on his CVC fees. Taking into account 
only his current ability to pay, because he is incarcerated with limited 
earning potential, he has no present opportunity to begin to pay down his 
ICAC assessments. For these reasons, the Court determines that [Yamashita] 
is presently unable to pay ICAC fee s. 
15 Yamashita testified that he worked approximately thirty -five 
hours a week and averaged about $15.00 to $20.00 a month in prison income. 
He also testified that his mother sometimes deposited $100.00 in his prison 
account, but clarified that these deposit s were irregular.

 reasoning as to Yamashita’s present inability to pay an  ICAC fee 
also applies to his present inability to pay a  CVC fee.   We 
agree with the circuit court’s conclusion that Yamashita is 
unable to pay an  ICAC fee, and find  that he is also unable to 
pay a  CVC fee  and that the CVC fee should be waived.   The 
circuit court’s findings,  that the ICA found supported  imposing  
a  CVC fee,  bore on  Yamashita ’s future —not present —ability to pay  
the fee.   Thus, because Yamashita is presently unable  to  pay, 
the circuit court erred by imposing a CVC fee  and the  ICA erred 
by affirming the circuit court’s imposition of such a fee.  19181716
16 Similar to the language in HRS §§ 351 -62.6(a) and 706-605(6) that 
mandates waiver where a defendant is presently unable to pay CVC fee s, HRS 
§ 846F -3(a) provides that “no [ICAC] fee shall be ordered when the court 
determines t hat the defendant is unable to pay the fee .” 
17 The circuit court imposed a $2,180.00 CVC fee and a $2,600.00 
ICAC fee on Yamashita and ultimately determined that Yamashita was not 
presently able to pay the $ 2,600.00  ICAC fee. 
18 The circuit court rea soned in COL No. 13 that Yamashita was 
“healthy, young, . . . able -bodied, and willing and able to find employment 
after release from custody.” The circuit court found in COL No. 14 that 
Yamashita’s work as a plumber at HCF “will provide him with training and a 
skillset that will allow him to become gainfully employed outside of prison.” 
The circuit court found in COL No. 15 that because Yamashita “has skills as a 
plumber, was employed at his evidentiary hearing, and has the ability to 
become employed in the future[,]” that “when he becomes employed outside of 
prison, the minimum payment of $30.00 per month would be feasible.” The 
circuit court concluded in COL No. 23 that although Yamashita was “not 
currently in a position where he is able to pay ICAC fe es because of his 
imprisonment and other financial obligations[,]” he was “willing and will 
eventually be able to pay the restitutions, fees, and fines, including his 
CVC fees.” 
19 The ICA, in holding the circuit court did not err by imposing a 
CVC fee on Yamashita, also found , in part , that “Yamashita voluntarily 
applied for his plumbing job at [HCF] because he wanted to work” and that “he 
intended to work full -time once released from prison or placed on parole to 
support his two daughters and pay his c ourt -ordered restitution, fines, and

B. The CVC Fee and DDR Assessment Are Not Un constitutional 
Taxes 
The CVC fee and DDR assessment were constitutional 
criminal fines , not unconstitutional taxes.20 “A fine . . . is a 
‘retributive payment’ due the sovereign[,]” and “advance[s] 
punitive objectives[.]” State v. Gaylord , 78 Hawaiʻ i 127, 152, 
890 P.2d 1167, 1192 (1995) ( quoting State v. Murray , 63 Haw. 12, 
16, 621 P.2d 334, 337 (1980) , then quoting Standards for 
Criminal Justice § 18–3.16 cmt. (Am. Bar Ass’n 1994) ). Criminal 
(. . . continued) 
fees.” A defendant’s expressed willingness to work while or after being 
incarcerated does not bear on their present or future ability to pay, and moreover, should not increase their risk of being subjected to financial  
punishment--that is, being saddled with court -imposed costs. As such, we do
not regard Yamashita’s willingness to work at HCF while incarcerated and 
after his release from prison as weighing in favor of imposing a CVC fee.     
20 The Hawaiʻi Constitution directs that “[t]he taxing power shall be 
reserved to the State[.]” Haw. Const. art. VIII, § 3. This court has 
confirmed that “[t]he power of taxation is essentially a legislative power” 
and “cannot be delegated” to the executive branch. Lingle , 120 Hawaiʻi  at 59, 
201 P.3d at 572 (quoting McCandless v. Campbell , 20 Haw. 411, 420 (1911)). 
Yamashita contends that to determine whether the CVC fee and DDR assessment 
amount to unconstitutional taxes, we should apply the test developed by this 
court in Medeiros . In Medeiros , a defendant sought to enjoin enforcement of 
a Honolulu ordinance that permitted the City and County to collect a fee from 
“a person convicted of any misdemeanor or felony” for “services performed by 
the city in connection with the arrest, processing, investigation, and 
prosecution of the convicted person.” 89 Hawaiʻi at 362 n.1, 973 P.2d at 737 
n.1. This court invalidated the ordinance, and set forth a three -part test: 
if “the charge (1) applies to the direct beneficiary of a particular service, 
(2) is allocated directly to defraying the costs of providing the service, 
and (3) is reasonably proportionate to the benefit received[,]” the charge is 
a permissible user fee, not an unconstitutional tax. Id. at 367, 973 P.2d at 
742. 
In Lingle , however, this court clarified that the Medeiros test 
“is properly confined to evaluating whether the charge is a user fee or a 
tax.” 120 Hawaiʻi at 64, 201 P.3d at 577. As discussed, infra , the CVC fee 
and DDR assessments are neither user fees nor taxes, but rather, criminal 
fines. Therefore, the Medeiros test is not applicable to this case.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
fines are expressly permitted under the Hawaiʻi Penal Code “as a 
means of penalizing the offender.” HRS § 706 -640 cmt. 
As the ICA held in its SDO, the CVC fee is a 
permissible criminal fine , not an unconstitutional tax, because : 
(1) the charge is “imposed after criminal conviction []” and is 
“authorized” by the legi slature as “punishment for criminal 
behavior [;]” (2) the charge is “paid into [a] special 
fund [] . . . that do [es] not reimburse payments related to ” or 
“offset the costs of” the defendant’s prosecution ; and (3) when 
imposing a CVC fee, the court must consider “the severity of the 
crime” and may also consider the criteria in HRS § 706 -641, 
which applies to other criminal fines. Adcock , 148 Hawaiʻi at 
320, 473 P.3d at 781 . 
Furthermore , the statutes authorizing the CVC fee and 
DDR assessment fall with in HRS chapter 706, titled “Disposition 
of Convicted Defendants,” which contains all provisions related 
to criminal punishment and sentencing, including probation, 
imposition of fees, fines, and restitution, and imprisonment. 
See HRS chapter 706 . Both the CVC fe e and DDR assessment are 
mandatory punishments imposed upon convicted defendants —a court 
may waive the CVC fee only if the defendant is unable to pay , 
HRS §§ 706-605(6), 351-62.6 , and may waive the DDR assessment 
only if the defendant is unable to pay or i s ordered to enter a

                            substance abuse treatment program at the defendant’s own 
expense , HRS § 706-650. And because the court is required to 
consider the severity of the defendant’s crime when setting the 
amount of the CVC fee and DDR assessment , the more s erious the 
offense, the higher the maximum amount the court may impose. 
See HRS § § 351-62.6 and 706-650. Because the CVC fee and DDR 
assessment are criminal fines and not taxes, the ICA did not err 
in upholding the constitutionality of the CVC fee and DD R 
assessment . 
V. CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, the ICA’s January 6, 2021 
Judgment on Appeal is vacated in part as to its imposition of 
the $ 2,180.00  CVC fee, as it was based on the conclusion that 
Yamashita will be able to pay the CVC fee in the future. The 
Judgment on Appeal is affirmed in all other respects. The case 
is remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings 
consistent with this opinion.
