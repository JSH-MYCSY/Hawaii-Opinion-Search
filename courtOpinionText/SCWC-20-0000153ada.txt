OPINION OF THE COURT BY NAKAYAMA, J. 
 
This case calls upon the court to determine whether a 
charging document alleging that a defendant committed second-
degree assault  by intentionally , knowingly , or recklessly  
causing substantial bodily injury must provide the defendant 
with the statutory definition o f “substantial bodily injury.”

2 includes generic terms, it must state the species and descend to 
particulars.  
Here, the term “substantial bodily injury” is a 
generic term.  A charging document  must therefore identify the 
species of “substantial bodily injury” alleged, and provide a 
defendant with particulars.  The Intermediate Court of Appeals 
(ICA) therefore correctly determined that the State of Hawaiʻi 
(the State) should have provided the st atutory definition of 
“substantial bodily injury” in the charging document at issue.  
We therefore affirm the ICA’s judgment.  
I. BACKGROUND  
A. Factual Background  
On the evening of August 25, 2019, Paul and Tish Costa 
(collectively, the Cost as; individually, Paul  or Tish) and 
Respondent/Defendant -Appellee John Keoni Jardine (Jardine)  
resided in two separate units at a residence on Nalu Street in 
Waimānalo.  The Costas lived in the unit that fronted the 
street, while Jardine lived in the rear unit.  
Around 8:45 P.M.  that night, Paul and Jardine engaged 
in an altercation in front of the Costas ’ unit.  Although it is 
unclear how the confrontation began, it is undisputed that 
Jardine struck Paul in the head using a metal baseball bat.  
Paul allegedly suffered a “left oc cipital skull fracture” and an 
“epidural hematoma, pneumocephale.”  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
3 B. Circuit Court Proceedings .1 
On August 28, 2019, Petitioner/Plaintiff -Appellant the  
State charged Jardine by felony information.  The body of the 
charging document read:  
 The Department of the Prosecuting Attorney charges:  
 
 On or about August 25, 2019, in the City and County 
of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, JOHN KEONI JARDINE, also 
known as John Keoni Jardine III and John Jardine III, did 
intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly cause substanti al 
bodily injury to Paul Costa, and/or did intentionally or 
knowingly cause bodily injury to Paul Costa with a 
dangerous instrument, thereby committing the offense of 
Assault in the Second Degree, in violation of Section 707 -
711(1)(a) and/or Section 707 -711(1)(d) of the Hawaii 
Revised Statutes.2 
On January 27, 2020, Jardine filed a Motion to Dismiss 
Felony Information Based Upon a Defective Charge.  Jardine 
alleged that the felony information did not “provide notice as 
to one of the elements of the offense,  to wit, the definitions 
of a ‘substantial bodily injury’ or ‘dangerous instrument’, and 
therefore the charge is a defective charge.”  According to 
                     
1  The Honorable Karen T. Nakasone  presided. 
 
2  Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-711 (Supp. 2016 ) provides in 
relevant part:  
 
Assault in the second degree. (1) A person commits 
the offense of assault in the second degree if:  
 
(a)  The person i ntentionally, knowingly, or 
recklessly causes substantial bodily injury to 
another; [or]  
 
. . . 
 
(d)  The person i ntentionally or knowingly causes 
bodily injury to another with a dangerous 
instrument[.]  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
4 Jardine, the felony information should have included the 
following statutory definition to be effective:  
“Substantial bodily injury” means bodily injury which 
causes 
 
(1) A major avulsion, laceration, or penetration of the 
skin; 
(2) A burn of at least second degree severity;  
(3) A bone fracture;  
(4) A serious concussion; or  
(5) A tearing, rupture, or corrosive damage to the 
esophagus, viscera, or other internal organs.  
HRS § 707-700 (2014). 
The State opposed Jardine’s motion.  Citing State v. 
Mita, 124 Hawaiʻi 385, 391 -92, 245 P.3d 458, 464 -65 (2010), the 
State responded that it only needs to provide  a statutory 
definition “where 1)  the definition creates an additional 
element of an offense and 2) the term itself does not provide a 
person of common understanding with fair notice of that 
element.”   Here, the State argued, the term “substantial bodily 
injury” did not include any hidden  essential element.  
Following a hearing on February 18, 2020, the circuit 
court granted Jardine’s motion  and dismissed the case without 
prejudice .  The circuit court reasoned that “the lay or common 
understanding of a ‘substantial’ bodily injury does not c onvey 
the extent or limits of the five specific types of ‘substantial’ 
bodily injury under the statutory definition,” and so the 
charging document  should have included the five statutory 
categories.  In turn, the felony information  “did not provide *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
5 [Jardine] with adequate notice and must be dismissed without 
prejudice.”  
C. ICA Proceedings  
The State appealed the circuit court’s order granting 
Jardine’s motion to dismiss to the ICA.  
On appeal, the State reiterated its assertion that it 
did not need to include the statutory definition of “substantial 
bodily injury” because the definition did not create any 
additional essential element.  The State added that the 
statutory definition of “substantial bodily injury” is readily 
comprehensible to a person of common unde rstanding because 
“[t]he common meaning of the term ‘substantial bodily injury’ is 
sufficiently broad enough to encompass the component parts of 
its definition.”  
Jardine responded that the definition of “substantial 
bodily injury” is an essential element o f a charge of assault in 
the second degree because it identifies the requisite “result -
of-conduct element.”  Jardine further argued that the statutory 
definition of “substantial bodily injury” is not readily 
comprehensible because the common understanding of the term is 
“immensely broad, expansive, and would include more conduct than 
the statutory definition.”  
On June 22, 2021, the ICA issued a summary disposition 
order affirming the circuit court’s order granting Jardine’s *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
6 motion to dismiss.  The ICA reaso ned that “where the statutory 
definition of an element of the crime ‘does not necessarily 
coincide with its common meaning[,]’ the statutory definition 
must be included in the charge.”  Applying this standard to the 
statutory definition of “substantial bod ily injury,” the ICA 
explained that “the common meaning of ‘substantial bodily 
injury’ is broader than the statutory definition, [so] the 
charge against Jardine was defective.”  The ICA therefore 
affirmed the circuit court’s order.  
This application for writ of certiorari followed.  
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW  
A. Sufficiency of the Charge  
The question of whether a charge sets forth all the 
essential elements of a charged offense is a question of law 
that this court reviews de novo under the right/wrong standard.  
State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawaiʻi 383, 390, 219 P.3d 1170, 1177 
(2009) (quoting State v. Wells , 78 Hawaiʻi 373, 379, 894 P.2d 70, 
76 (1995)).  
III.  DISCUSSION  
On certiorari, the State seeks clarification of 
whether a document  charging a defendant with second -degree 
assault under HRS §  707-711(a) or (d) should include the 
statutory definitions of “substantial bodily injury” and 
“dangerous instrument.”  We hold that “substantial bodily *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
7 injury” is a generic term  for which the State must include the 
statutory definition by stating the species of  injury allegedly 
inflicted, and/or a “to wit” clause specifying the alleged 
injury.  We therefore affirm the ICA’s summary disposition order 
on a different ground.3 
A. The State must include the statutory definition of 
“substantial b odily injury”  in a charge of second -degree 
assault under HRS §  707-711(a). 
Pursuant to article I, section 14 of the Hawaiʻi 
Constitution, an accused  possesses the right “to be informed of 
the nature and cause of the accusation”  against him.   In 
considering whether a charging document complies with this 
constitutional requirement, this court has stated that  
It is well settled that an “accusation must sufficiently 
allege all of the essential elements of the offense 
charged,” a requirement that  “obtains whether an accusation 
is in the nature of an oral charge, information, 
indictment, or complaint[.]”  State v. Jendrusch , 58 Haw. 
279, 281 , 567 P.2d 1242, 1244 (1977).  Put differently, the 
sufficiency of the charging instrument is measured, inter 
alia, by “whether it contains the elements of the offense 
intended to be charged, and sufficiently apprises the 
defendant of what he [or she] must be prepared to meet[.]”  
State v. Wells , 78 Hawaiʻi 373, 379 -80, 894 P.2d 70, 76 -77 
(1995) (citations and in ternal quotation marks omitted) 
(brackets in original).  “A charge defective in this regard 
amounts to a failure to state an offense, and a conviction 
based upon it cannot be sustained, for that would 
constitute a denial of due process.”  Jendrusch , 58 Haw . at 
281, 567 P.2d at 1244 (citations omitted).  
State v. Merino , 81 Hawaiʻi 198, 212, 915 P.2d 672, 686 (1996).  
                     
3  Because the ICA did not reach the merits of the State’s arguments on 
the statutory definition of “dangerous weapon,”  we decline the State’s 
invitation to address the same.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
8 Throughout the se proceedings, the parties have 
disputed whether the State was required to include  the full 
statutory definition of the term “sub stantial bodily injury” in 
the charging document to inform Jardine of the nature and cause 
of the accusation against him.  However, this inquiry falls one 
step short because including the full statutory definition would 
not sufficiently apprise the defenda nt of what he must be 
prepared to meet.  Wells, 78 Hawaiʻi at 379-80, 894 P.2d at 76-
77. 
In general, “[w]here the statute sets forth with 
reasonable clarity all essential elements of the crime 
intended to be punished, and fully defines the offense in 
unmistakable terms readily comprehensible to persons of 
common understanding, a charge drawn in the language of the 
statute is sufficient.”  [ Jendrusch , 58 Haw. at 282, 567 
P.2d at 1245]; [ State v. Cummings , 101 Hawaiʻi 139, 143, 63 
P.3d 1109, 1113 (2003)] (cit ations omitted); see [Hawaiʻi 
Rules of Penal Procedure] Rules 5 and 7 (2007).  
However, “ where the definition of an offense .  . . 
includes generic terms, it is not sufficient that the 
indictment shall charge the offense in the same generic 
terms as in the d efinition; but it must state the species 
. . . [and] descend to particulars.”  State v. Israel , 78 
Hawaiʻi 66, 73, 890 P.2d 303, 310 [(1995)] (quoting Russell 
v. United States , 369 U.S. 749, 765 (1962)).  
Wheeler, 121 Hawaiʻi at 393, 219 P.3d at 1181. 
The statutory definition of “substantial bodily 
injury” is generic .  A term is “generic” if it “relat[es] to or 
[is] characteristic of a whole group or class.”  Webster’s 
Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary  348 (1965).4  As statutorily 
                     
4  The New Oxford American Dictionary similarly defines “generic” as 
“characteristic of or relating to a class or group of things; not specific.”  
The New Oxford American Dictionary  706 (2001).  The Random House Webs ter’s 
unabridged dictionary defines “generic” as “of, applicable to, or referring *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
9 defined, “substantial bodily injury”  is a generic term that  
covers five “classes” of injuries:  
(1) A major avulsion, laceration, or penetration of the 
skin; 
(2) A burn of at least second degree severity;  
(3) A bone fracture;  
(4) A serious concussion; or  
(5) A tearing, rupture, or corrosive damage to the 
esophagus, viscera, or other internal organs.  
HRS § 707-700.  Thus, it is incumbent upon the State to “state 
the species .  . . [and] descend to particulars.”  Israel, 78 
Hawaiʻi at 73, 890 P.2d at 310; see also  United States v. 
Donovan, 339 F.2d 404 , 407-08 (7th Cir. 1964) (explaining that 
the charging document must specify the offense charged  “where 
the statute .  . . proscribes different types of conduct in the 
disjunctive.”).  Applied to the present case, this standard 
requires the State to identif y the species of injury by alleging 
that the alleged substantial bodily injury consisted of “a bone 
fracture” and “a serious concussion” in order to provide 
sufficient notice.  See Wells, 78 Hawaiʻi at 379-80, 894 P.2d at 
76-77. 
Furthermore, it would be pr udent for the State to 
incorporate a “to wit” clause identifying the specific injuries 
suffered – here, a “left occipital skull fracture” and an 
“epidural hematoma , pneumocephale” – in charges alleging that a 
                     
to all the members of a genus, class, group, or kind; general.”  Random House 
Webster’s unabridged dictionary  796 (2d ed. 2001).  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
10 defendant has caused substantial bodily injury.   See State v. 
Pacquing , 139 Hawaiʻi 302, 308, 389 P.3d 897, 903 (2016)  (holding 
the State should have “at least specified in the charge the 
items of information that allegedly were unlawfully 
possessed.”) .  As we have previously noted, “the charge ‘must b e 
specific enough to ensure that the grand jury [or the court 
before which a preliminary hearing is held] had before it all 
the facts necessary to find probable cause.’”  Israel, 78 Hawaiʻi 
at 70, 890 P.2d at 307 (quoting State v. Daly , 4 Haw. App. 52, 
54 n.6, 659 P.2d 83, 85 n.6 (1983)).  The inclusion of such 
information would apprise a defendant of what the defendant  must 
be prepared to meet.  Wells, 78 Hawaiʻi at 379-80, 894 P.2d at 
76-77. 
This detailed approach has been endorsed by other 
courts.  For i nstance, federal courts have required that 
statutory language “must be accompanied with such a statement of 
the facts and circumstances as will inform the accused of the 
specific offense, coming under the general description, with 
which he is charged ,” when the “very core of criminality” 
“depends so crucially upon such a specific identification of 
fact.”  Russell, 369 U.S. at 765 (quoting United States v. Hess , 
124 U.S. 483, 487 (1888)); see also, e.g. , United States v. 
Williamson , 903 F.3d 124, 131 -32 (D.C. Cir. 2018); United States 
v. Quinn , 359 F.3d 666, 672 -73 (4th Cir. 2004).  The Colorado *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
11 Supreme Court has similarly adopted a requirement that “the 
indictment must answer the questions of ‘who, what, where, and 
how.’”  People v. Tucker , 631 P.2d 162, 163 -64 (Colo. 1981)  (En 
Banc). 
In light of the foregoing, the ICA correctly 
determined that the State should have included the statutory 
definition of substantial bodily injury in the charging 
document.  However, we affirm because “substantial bodily 
injury” is a generic term.  We therefore do not address the 
issue of whether the statutory definition of “substantial bodily 
injury” coincides with its common meaning or the merits of the 
ICA’s reasoning that “where the statutor y definition of an 
element of the crime ‘does not necessarily coincide with its 
common meaning,’ the statutory definition must be included in 
the charge.”  Agsalud v. Lee , 66 Haw. 425, 430, 664 P.2d 734, 
738 (1983).  
B. The State waived its argument that  discovery materials 
provided  Jardine with actual knowledge of  the charges 
against him . 
During oral argument, the State argued that even if 
the charging document was insufficient,  the discovery materials 
it gave Jardine provided him with sufficient notice of the 
charges against him.  Although the State made this claim  before 
the circuit court,  it expressly abandoned any such  argument 
before the ICA .  Furthermore, the State did not  brief the matter *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
 
12 
before this court.  We therefore do not address the merits of 
the State’s actual knowledge argument.  Hawaiʻi Rules of 
Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(4), (7) (2016).  
IV. CONCLUSION  
In light of the foregoing, the circuit court correctly 
determined that the felony information against Jardine was 
insufficient because it did not  state the species of Paul’s 
substantial bodily injuries or descend to the particulars of 
Paul’s injuries.  Israel, 78 Hawaiʻi at 73, 890 P.2d at 310.  In 
turn, the ICA did not err in affirming the circuit court’s 
decision.  
Accordingly, we affirm the ICA’ s July 20, 2021  
Judgment on Appeal, which affirmed the circuit court’s  
February  20, 2020 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and 
Order Granting Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss Felony Information 
Based Upon a Defective Charge, Filed 1/27/20 .
