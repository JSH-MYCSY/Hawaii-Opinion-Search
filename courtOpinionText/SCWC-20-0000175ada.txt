 number, not name, and (2) a challenge to extended term 
sentencing jury instructions for attempted murder.  
 
We affirm Brandon Lafoga and Ranier Ines’ convictions.  But 
we remand for a new extended term sentencing hearing and resentencing. 
I. 
 
The State alleged Brandon Lafoga and Ranier Ines committed 
several crimes.  It charged Lafoga with attempted murder in the second degree, conspiracy to commit murder in the second degree, 
carrying or use of firearm in the commission of a separate 
felony, kidnapping, and ownership or possession prohibited of 
any firearm or ammunition by a person convicted of certain 
crimes (felon in possession).  In the same indictment, the State 
charged Ines with accomplice to attempted murder in the second degree, conspiracy to commit murder, kidnapping, and robbery in 
the first degree.  
On the eve of trial, after ruling on several motions in 
limine, the trial court decided to seat an innominate jury.  
Everyone would refer to prospective jurors by number, not name.  
The court told the parties it would conceal the prospective 
jurors’ identifying information, including their names, phone numbers, and addresses.  Only the court would have that 
information.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
3 
 Ines’ counsel asked 
the court to clarify.  Did the court 
intend to disclose the prospective jurors’ names to defense 
counsel and the prosecution?  The court did not.  The 
prosecution objected.  The deputy prosecuting attorney dubbed 
the process “dehumanizing.”  Ines’ counsel agreed, adding that 
the attorneys needed the jurors’ names to research information 
about the prospective jurors.  Then, the prosecution asked why 
the court planned to deviate from the standard jury selection procedure.  “I’m trying to head off a juror in this panel 
saying, I’m afraid to serve,” the court explained.  Ines’ 
counsel repeated her concern: no names impaired jury selection 
preparation and execution.  Counsel proposed that the attorneys 
receive the jurors’ full names “but we both will not provide the 
list to our clients, but they will be present with us when we do 
jury selection.
”  
 After further discussion, the court indicated it would tell the jurors about the number system, but not why they’d be called numbers.  The court aimed to “quell anxiety”: “I have, in the 
past, had to inform jurors to quell anxiety, that there’s been 
no incidents whatsoever.  I do believe that’s the situation 
here, but I don’t want it to be raised in the entire panel’s 
consciousness at all because we want them to serve.”
  
Lafoga’s counsel wondered about the process.  Did the court 
mean the lawyers would not know the prospective jurors’ names?  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
4 
 The court clarified its plan and explained the ground rules: the 
defense and prosecution (not the defendants and public) would 
know the names of the jurors, but not their addresses or phone 
numbers.  Also, no one could say the jurors’ names on the 
record.
  
After that, the attorneys raised no concerns.  Defense 
counsel made no objection to keeping the jurors’ names from the 
defendants.  Later, right before jury selection began, the court asked if counsel objected to the number system.  No one did. 
During its introductory remarks, the court told the 
prospective jurors they would be identified by number.  The 
court implied that this procedure protected the jurors’ privacy.   
Ladies and gentlemen, when [the bailiff] did the initial 
roll call for this jury panel, each of you were given a 
card with your name on it along with your number.  Please 
remember that number, that is your number, and for the rest 
of the proceedings in this case you will be addressed by 
that number.  Your actual names are known to the Court and 
to the attorneys, and other than a sealed list that will be kept for court records, no one else will know your actual 
names, so the public can’t get your names and they cannot get your contact information, so only court and counsel 
will have your names.  For the rest of the proceedings 
you’ll be addressed by your number. 
 
(Emphasis added.)   
Trial happened in November 2019.  The jury found Lafoga 
guilty of attempted murder, use of firearm in a separate felony, 
kidnapping, and felon in possession of a firearm.  Answering a 
special interrogatory, the jury found that the kidnapping count *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
5 
 merged with the attempted murder count, and later the court 
dismissed the kidnapping charge. 
The jury found Ines guilty of accomplice to attempted 
murder, kidnapping, and robbery in the first degree.  Answering 
a special interrogatory, the jury found that the kidnapping and 
robbery counts merged with the accomplice to attempted murder 
count, and later the court dismissed the kidnapping and robbery 
charges. 
The verdicts did not end the jury’s service.  They remained 
for an extended term sentencing hearing.  The jury had to decide whether extending Lafoga and Ines’ ordinary statutory maximum 
sentences was “necessary for the protection of the public.”  HRS 
§§ 706-662 (2014), 706-664 (2014).  
For each defendant’s attempted murder convictions, the 
court gave an extended term jury instruction and posed a special 
interrogatory.  The court’s instructions and interrogatories 
conformed to the Hawaiʻ i Standard Jury Instructions – Criminal.  
Lafoga’s instruction read in part: 
[T]he prosecution has alleged that BRANDON FETU LAFOGA is a 
persistent offender, a multiple offender, and that extended 
terms of imprisonment are necessary for the protection of 
the public.  The prosecution has the burden of proving 
these allegat ions beyond a reasonab le doubt.  It is your 
duty to decide, in each count, whether the prosecution has 
done so by answering the following three essential 
questions on special interrogatory forms that will be 
provided to you: 
 
1. Has the prosecution proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Defendant BRANDON FETU LAFOGA is a persistent offender 
in that he has previously been convicted of two or more *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
6 
 felonies committed at different times when he was eighteen 
years of age or older? 
 
2.  Has the prosecution proved beyond a reasonable doubt 
that Defendant BRANDON FETU LAFOGA is a multiple offender 
in that he is being sentenced for two or more felonies?  
3.  Has the prosecution proved beyond a reasonable doubt 
that it is necessary for the protection of the public to 
extend the sentences for Defendant BRANDON FETU LAFOGA in 
Count 2 [Attempted Murder] from a possible life term of 
imprisonment to a definite life term of 
imprisonment . . . ?   
 
(Emphasis added.)  The court’s companion special interrogatory 
read in part: “Has the prosecution proved beyond a reasonable 
doubt that it is necessary for the protection of the public to 
extend the sentence in Count 2 for Defendant BRANDON FETU LAFOGA 
from a possible life term of imprisonment to a definite life 
term of imprisonment?”  (Emphasis added.)  
   Ines’ extended term jury instruction mostly tracked 
Lafoga’s, reading in part: 
[T]he prosecution has alleged that RANIER INES is a 
persistent offender and that extended terms of imprisonment 
are necessary for the protection of the public.  The prosecution has the burden of proving these allegations 
beyond a reasonable doubt.  It is your duty to decide, in 
each count, whether the prosecution has done so by 
answering the following two essential questions on special 
interrogatory forms that will be provided to you: 
 
1. Has the prosecution proved beyond a reasonable doubt 
that Defendant RANIER INES is a persistent offender in that 
he has previously been convicted of two or more felonies 
committed at different times when he was eighteen years of age or older? 
 
2. Has the prosecution proved beyond a reasonable doubt 
that it is necessary for the protection of the public to extend the sentences for Defendant RANIER INES in Count 1 
[Accomplice to Attempted Murder] from a possible life term 
of imprisonment to a definite life term of imprisonment . . . ? 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
7 
 (Emphasis added.)  Ines’ special interrogatory asked the jury 
about his accomplice to attempted murder conviction, in part:  
“Has the prosecution proved beyond a reasonable doubt that it is 
necessary for the protection of the public to extend the 
sentence in Count 1 for Defendant RANIER INES from a possible 
life term of imprisonment to a definite life term of 
imprisonment?”  (Emphasis added.)  
 The defendants had objected to those instructions and 
special interrogatories.  The word “possible” could mislead the jury into thinking that there would not be a life term of 
imprisonment unless they received an extended life term of 
imprisonment, the defendants insisted.  
The jury found the State had proven the extended term 
sentencing elements for Lafoga’s attempted murder conviction; 
same for Ines’ accomplice to attempted murder conviction.   
Now eligible for the extended life without the possibility 
of parole term, the defendants faced sentencing.  HRS § 706-661 (2014).  The court sentenced Lafoga to an extended term of life 
without parole for attempted murder.  Because the jury made 
extended term findings for Lafoga’s two other convictions, the 
court increased his imprisonment to life with the possibility of 
parole for use of firearm in a separate felony, and a twenty-
year term with the possibility of parole for felon in *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
8 
 possession.  On appeal, Lafoga only challenges the extended term 
jury instructions for the attempted murder conviction.   
 
As for Ines, the court sentenced him to an extended term of 
life without parole for his accomplice to attempted murder conviction.
  
The defendants appealed.  They each raised four points of 
error.  The Intermediate Court of Appeals consolidated their 
appeals.  In a published opinion, the ICA affirmed Lafoga and Ines’ convictions. 
Both Lafoga and Ines petitioned for certiorari.  We 
accepted cert, and per Hawaiʻ i Rul
 es of Appellate Procedure Rule 
40.1, limited the scope of our review to two issues: the jury selection issue and the jury instructions issue.  
II. 
 
Lafoga and Ines argue that the circuit court empaneled an 
anonymous jury.  They maintain the court’s jury selection method violated their constitutional right to a presumption of 
innocence and an impartial jury. 
We disagree.  There was no constitutional violation.   
First, we discuss the defendants’ claim that their jury was 
anonymous or “partially anonymous.”  It was not.  
With an anonymous jury, defense counsel and the prosecution
do not know the prospective jurors’ names.  “[O]ne necessary component” of an anonymous jury is that the jurors’ names are  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
9 
 withheld from the attorneys and parties.  United States v. 
Harris, 763 F.3d 881, 885-86 (7th Cir. 2014); United States v. 
Ross, 33 F.3d 1507, 1521 n.27 (11th Cir. 1994) (describing an 
anonymous jury as one where the jurors’ names and information 
are concealed from the public, lawyers, and defendants); see 
also Abraham Abramovsky & Jonathan I. Edelstein, Anonymous 
Juries: In Exigent Circumstances Only, 13 St. John’s J. Legal 
Comment. 457, 457-58 (1999) (identifying United States v. Barnes, 604 F.2d 121 (2nd Cir. 1979), where a New York federal 
district court in 1977 kept secret the jurors’ names and 
addresses in an organized crime trial, as the first “anonymous” 
jury trial in state or federal courts.). 
Nor was the jury a “partially anonymous” jury.  See State 
v. Samonte, 83 Hawaiʻ i 507, 928 P.2d 1 (1996) (trial court 
ordered that the first names, street addresses, and phone numbers of prospective jurors and their spouses be redacted from 
juror-information cards, and thereby empaneled a “partially 
anonymous jury.”).  Because Lafoga’s and Ines’ counsel and the 
prosecution knew the full names of the prospective jurors, the jury was not a completely or partially anonymous jury. 
This case’s jury is better described as a confidential 
jury.  A confidential jury withholds a juror’s name from the 
public, but not the parties.  See Harris, 763 F.3d at 885-86 
(distinguishing between a confidential jury, where jury *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
10 
 information is available to the parties but not the public, and 
an anonymous jury, where the information is withheld from both 
the public and the parties).  A confidential jury mainly 
concerns the public’s First Amendment right to access trial 
proceedings, not the parties’ right to the jurors’ information.  
See Oahu Publications Inc. v. Ahn, 133 Hawaiʻ i 482, 495-96, 331 
P.3d 460, 473-74 (2014) (balancing the public’s First Amendment 
right to access judicial proceedings with the due process 
concerns of the parties); Harris, 763 F.3d at 886 (explaining 
that a confidential jury challenge “focuses on whether access to 
the courts has been properly denied.”). 
Lafoga and Ines do not raise an access-to-the-courts 
challenge.  Rather, their claims focus on the court’s numbers system and its decision to keep the jurors’ names from them.   
An anonymous jury hobbles both sides.  The defense and 
prosecution lose the ability to uncover useful information for 
jury selection and trial purposes.  See United States v. Stone, 
No. CR 19-0018 (ABJ), 2020 WL 1892360, at *33 n.54 (D.D.C. Apr. 
16, 2020) (quoting Nancy Gertner, Judith H. Mizner, & Joshua 
Dubin, The Law of Juries, Chapter 3 Section 3 at § 3.28, § 3.31, 
10th ed. (2018) for the conclusions that “[t]he internet, and in 
particular social media . . . offers the possibility of a rich 
source of information about jurors that escapes the constraints 
of formal voir dire” and “[a]t the very minimum, pre-trial *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
11 investigation of potential jurors . . . can provide counsel with 
the justification for more probing voir dire questions . . . .  
And it can provide a direct basis for a cause challenge to a 
particular juror.”). 
But a confidential jury does not have this problem.  With 
the potential jurors’ names in hand, handy info is keystrokes 
away.  See id. (citing Thaddeous Hoffmeister, Investigating 
Jurors in the Digital Age: One Click at a Time, 60 U. Kan. L. 
Rev. 611, 612 (2012) for the observation that “[t]he speed and 
ease by which information about jurors is now discovered online 
has led attorneys to increasingly investigate and research 
jurors.  In fact, the practice has become fairly commonplace, 
with courts, practitioners, and state bar associations all 
approving and encouraging its use.”). 
Here, the defense and prosecution knew the prospective 
jurors’ names.  Before (and during) jury selection, the lawyers had a chance to learn more about these citizens.  The court’s method did not deprive the parties of information-gathering 
techniques, like online and social media research, that might 
discover helpful information to challenge a juror for cause, 
exercise a peremptory challenge, or tailor an argument.  Lafoga 
and Ines fail to show how the circuit court prejudiced their 
ability to meaningfully conduct jury selection. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
12 
 A confidential jury and an anonymous jury have their 
differences, but they also have a common feature: jurors are 
identified by number, not name.  See State v. Sandoval, 788 
N.W.2d 172, 194-95 (Neb. 2010) (“numbers jury” empaneled when the court identified potential jurors by number, and counsel, 
but not the defendant, knew their names).  
A numbers jury may undermine the presumption of innocence.  
A person called a number may think their anonymity is necessary to protect them or someone else from a dangerous person - the 
defendant.  See Samonte, 83 Hawaiʻ i at 519, 928 P.2d at 12-13 
(“An anonymous jury raises the specter that the defendant is a 
dangerous person from whom the jurors must be protected, thereby implicating the defendant’s constitutional right to a 
presumption of innocence.”). 
A numbers jury is drastic.  Trial courts should sparingly 
use this jury selection method.  Evidence has to support an 
innominate jury.  For a fully anonymous, partially anonymous, or 
confidential jury, a trial court must detail a “strong reason” 
the jury or jury system needs protection and make clear, evidence-based findings to support the conclusion.  Then, the 
court must take reasonable precautions to minimize prejudice to 
the defendant.  Id. at 520, 928 P.2d at 14.  Reasonable measures 
to minimize prejudice include an example suggested by Samonte: 
“a plausible and nonprejudicial reason for not disclosing [the *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
13 
 jurors’] identities . . . (e.g., the trial court could instruct 
the jurors that the purpose for juror anonymity is to protect 
the jurors from contacts by the news media, thereby implying 
that juror anonymity is not the result of threats from the 
criminal defendant).”  Id. at 522, 928 P.2d at 16.   
 Here, the trial court used Samonte’s media-centered 
alternative reason to explain the confidential jury method.  The 
trial court told prospective jurors: “Your actual names are known to the Court and to the attorneys, and other than a sealed 
list that will be kept for court records, no one else will know 
your actual names, so the public can’t get your names and they 
cannot get your contact information.”  Later, the court advised 
the seated jury:   
Ladies and gentlemen, also, as we continue through this 
trial, you are going to be referred to by your juror number 
as well as your chair number.  Your names are not made part 
of the public record of this case.  You already see that there is a camera here in the courtroom.  While they are 
permitted to cover the proceedings, the press is not 
allowed to have any likeness of yours, so they can’t take 
any pictures of you, they cannot take any video of you, 
they cannot depict the jury in this case.  So in addition 
to your names, your likeness will not be made part of the public record or available to the public in any way in this 
case. 
 
There may be some naivete surrounding a court-crafted 
plausible reason.  Jurors may not buy it.  And this has the 
potential to erode the court’s integrity.  For this reason and 
the chipping of the presumption of innocence that comes from 
seating an anonymous or confidential jury, we disfavor a jury *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
14 
 selection process that uses numbers, not names, to identify 
prospective jurors. 
 Here, we conclude there was no strong, evidence-rooted 
reason to empanel a confidential jury.  The court’s hunch that 
some jurors might say they are “afraid to serve” does not 
support a confidential jury.  The presumption of innocence 
doesn’t take a backseat to abstract notions.  The court 
should’ve handled this jury selection like any trial: a juror who expresses a fearful outlook that impairs impartiality will 
get excused for cause.  Accordingly, unless there is evidence 
supporting a strong reason to have a numbers jury, see Samonte, 
83 Hawaiʻ i at 520 -21, 928 P.2d at 14-15 (jury tampering), the 
normal jury selection process should unfold with the jurors 
addressed by their names.   
We turn to something undetected by trial counsel.  The 
parties and court overlooked HRS § 612-18(c) (Supp. 2014), which 
provides that the names of prospective jurors and the “contents 
of [their] juror qualification forms . . . shall be made 
available to the litigants concerned.”  (On appeal, Ines mentioned the law as part of his Samonte analysis).  Learning 
information from the juror qualification forms, however, is not 
an absolute right.  Because the law’s language is directory; it 
can be disregarded if necessary to protect the safety of the 
  
at 523, jury or the integrity of the jury system.  Id. 83 Hawaiʻi  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
15 
 928 P.2d at 17 (determining that the “shall” in HRS § 612-18(c)
is directory, not mandatory).  Still, there must be a strong 
reason to dodge HRS § 612-18, and per above, the court lacked 
one.  
But the trial court’s failure to adhere to HRS § 612-18(c) 
or provide a strong reason for the confidential jury selection 
process, does not alone make the defendants’ trial 
constitutionally unfair.  Defense counsel did not object to the court’s jury selection method.  But even if they did, the 
court’s error did not impact Lafoga and Ines’ constitutional 
rights.  See State v. Mundon, 121 Hawaiʻ i 339, 368,  219 P.3d 
1126, 1155 (2009) (providing that when there is no reasonable 
possibility that a trial court’s error contributed to a 
defendant’s conviction, the error is “harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt.”). 
Neither Lafoga nor Ines point to anything that shows how 
the court’s jury selection method prejudiced them.  And our examination of the record does not show that the defendants were 
prejudiced.  Before jury selection the lawyers had a chance to gather helpful information.  During jury selection the lawyers 
engaged the prospective jurors and learned things about their 
backgrounds and attitudes.  Defense counsel rejected jurors, 
exercising most of their twelve peremptory challenges and 
waiving the rest.  Lafoga and Ines sat next to defense counsel *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
16 
 throughout jury selection.  Though they did not know the jurors’ 
names, the defendants saw and heard the prospective jurors.  
Nothing in the record suggests the defendants were unable to 
meaningfully participate and aid counsel during jury selection.   
The trial was constitutionally sound, and we affirm the ICA 
in this respect.  
III. 
The convictions stand.  But the defendants’ life without 
the possibility of parole sentences do not. 
For the defendants’ attempted murder convictions, we hold 
that the court’s extended term sentencing jury instructions and 
special interrogatories were prejudicially erroneous and 
misleading.  
Under HRS § 706–662, a defendant convicted of a felony “may 
be subject to an extended term of imprisonment” if a jury finds 
beyond a reasonable doubt that the extended term is “necessary 
for the protection of the public” and the defendant satisfies certain criteria, like being a “persistent offender.”    
Lafoga and Ines concede they were persistent offenders.  
Their challenge focuses on the jury’s “necessary for the 
protection of the public” finding for their attempted murder 
convictions.  The two argue the court’s extended term jury 
instruction and special interrogatory confused and misled the 
jury.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
17 
 Lafoga’s extended term jury instruction queried: 
Has the prosecution proved beyond a reasonable doubt that 
it is necessary for the protection of the public to extend the sentences for Defendant BRANDON FETU LAFOGA in Count 2 
[Attempted Murder] from a possible life term of imprisonment to a definite life term of 
imprisonment . . . ?  
 
(Emphasis added.)  Likewise, Lafoga’s special interrogatory 
asked, in part: “Has the prosecution proved beyond a reasonable 
doubt that it is necessary for the protection of the public to 
extend the sentence in Count 2 for Defendant BRANDON FETU LAFOGA from a possible life term of imprisonment to a definite life 
term of imprisonment?”  (Emphasis added.) 
Ines’ extended term jury instruction similarly queried: 
2. Has the prosecution proved beyond a reasonable doubt 
that it is necessary for the protection of the public to 
extend the sentences for Defendant RANIER INES in Count 1 
[Accomplice to Attempted Murder] from a possible life term 
of imprisonment to a definite life term of imprisonment . . . ? 
 
(Emphasis added.)  And Ines’ special interrogatory asked, in 
part: “Has the prosecution proved beyond a reasonable doubt that 
it is necessary for the protection of the public to extend the sentence in Count 1 for Defendant RANIER INES from a possible 
life term of imprisonment to a definite life term of 
imprisonment?”  (Emphasis added.)  
The defendants maintain that “possible life term of 
imprisonment” portends a “less-than-life sentence.”  A “possible 
life term of imprisonment” compared to a “definite life term of 
imprisonment” indicates that they will possibly get a sentence *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
18 
 shorter than life.  The word “possible” may spur the jury to 
select the harsher option, they say.  Lafoga and Ines argue the 
jury instructions did not properly convey the options.  A 
“possible” life term, meant they were going to get a life term – 
not something less than life - regardless of the jury’s answer 
to the interrogatory. 
The State counters that the extended term sentencing jury 
instructions and special interrogatories were fine.
  They came 
from State v. Keohokapu and tracked the Hawaiʻ i Standard Jury 
Instructions – Criminal (HAWJIC).  See, e.g., HAWJIC 19.3.1A. 
Persistent Offender: H.R.S. § 706-662(1) (asking whether “the prosecution proved beyond a reasonable doubt that it is necessary for the protection of the public to extend the 
Defendant’s sentence from a . . . possible life term of 
imprisonment” to a “definite life term of imprisonment”).  
The ICA sided with the State, holding that “[t]he extended 
term jury instruction for both defendants was not erroneous 
It stressed that the jury instructions were similar to an 
instruction suggested in a footnote by the Keohokapu majority 
and identical to the standard jury instructions.  The ICA 
pointed out that Keohokapu advised: “[t]o determine whether an 
extended term of imprisonment is necessary for the protection ofthe public, . . . the jury should not be instructed about the  under State v. Keohokapu.”  127 
Hawaiʻi 91, 276 P.3d 660 (2012).  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
19 
 procedures of the Hawaiʻ i Paroling Authority, or that the
sentence includes the possibility of parole.”  
We clarify Keohokapu and straighten our case law to align 
with the statutory language of Hawaiʻ i’s extended term sentencing 
laws.   
To start, we discuss Keohokapu.  The jury found the 
defendant guilty of manslaughter, a class A felony offense with 
an “indeterminate term of imprisonment of twenty years without 
the possibility of suspense of sentence or probation.”  HRS 
§ 706-659 (2014).  The State moved for extended term sentencing.  
Per HRS § 706-664, the Sixth Amendment, and article I section 14 
of the Hawaiʻ i Constitution, a jury finding is required to make a 
defendant eligible for a sentence exceeding the ordinary 
statutory maximum.  Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 494 
(2000); Flubacher v. State, 142 Hawaiʻ i 109, 118-19, 414 P.3d 
161, 170-71 (2018).  Thus, the trial court asked Keohokapu’s 
jury: “Has the prosecution proven beyond a reasonable doubt that 
it is necessary for the protection of the public to subject 
[Keohokapu] to an extended term of imprisonment, which would 
extend the maximum length of his imprisonment for the offense of Manslaughter from twenty years of incarceration to life with the 
possibility of parole?”  Keohokapu, 127 Hawaiʻ i at 100 n.16, 276 
P.3d at 669 n.16.  The court also gave instructions that defined 
“indeterminate term of imprisonment” and discussed many aspects *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
20 
 of “parole.”  It rejected long defense instructions about parole 
procedures and processes.  Id. at 99-100, 276 P.3d at 668-69. 
Keohokapu addressed a discrete question: “Whether the ICA 
gravely erred by determining that no error occurred when the 
trial court instructed the jury on the irrelevant issues of 
parole and the role of the Hawaiʻ i Paroling Authority during the 
extended term phase of trial?”  Id. at 101, 276 P3d at 670.  
Both the majority and dissent endorsed instructions that 
sidestepped explanations about parole roles, procedures, and 
processes.  See Keohokapu, 127 Hawaiʻ i at 116, 276 P.3d at 685. 
(Recktenwald, C.J., dissenting in part) (agreeing with the 
majority that “additional information about how the parole 
process works . . . was not required by the statute”).  
But the dissent critiqued the majority’s reluctance to 
mention or even use the word “parole” in extended term jury instructions.  It spotlighted a flaw with the majority’s 
framework: the majority failed to account for a jury decision 
after a second-degree murder conviction; that is, whether the 
defendant should receive an extended term of life without 
parole, rather than a sentence of life with the possibility of 
parole.  Id. at 123-24, 276 P.3d 692-93.  Pointing to HRS § 706-
661, the dissent explained that a jury could not meaningfully choose between those two sentences without knowing about parole and “[t]hus the legislature clearly contemplated that juries *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
21 
 would not be shielded from the fact that parole is available.”  
Id. at 116, 276 P.3d at 685. 
 The Keohokapu majority, in response, recommended an 
extended term sentencing instruction for a second-degree murder 
case: “instruct the jury to consider whether the defendant’s 
sentence should be extended from possible life imprisonment to a 
definite (or fixed) sentence of life imprisonment.”  Id. at 112 
n.33, 276 P.3d at 681 n.33.   
 The ICA used this footnote, and the HAWJIC standard jury 
instructions it inspired, to support upholding the trial court’s 
instructions in Lafoga and Ines’ case.  
Because now the conceptual discussion in Keohokapu has real 
controversy, we clarify that a jury considering extended term 
sentencing for second-degree murder must determine whether the 
prosecution has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that it is 
necessary for the protection of the public to extend a sentence 
from life with the possibility of parole to life without the possibility of parole.  A few reasons guide our holding.  
 First, the legislature was clear.  HRS §§ 706-662 and 706-
664 set forth the criteria and procedures for extended term 
sentencing, and HRS § 706-661 specifies the “length” of an 
extended sentence.  If it is “necessary for the protection of 
the public,” then a person convicted of second-degree murder may 
be sentenced to “life without the possibility of parole.”  HRS *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
22 
 § 706-661.  The legislature’s extended term sentencing laws 
contemplate that the jury will decide whether a person is 
eligible for a sentence of life without the possibility of 
parole or life with the possibility of parole.  And, by 
extension, the jury will consider the word “parole.” 
No evidence or jury instructions describing parole matters 
are needed for the jury to consider the difference between life 
with and life without
 parole.  Keohokapu’s holding is satisfied 
in this respect.  “Parole” is all the jury needs to hear.  The 
jury inquiry depends on the word “parole” but does not depend on 
the nuances of parole.    
 A jury navigates complex words and concepts.  The 
collective wisdom of twelve citizens is a defining virtue of 
America’s jury trial system.  We believe jurors will use their 
common understanding and knowledge to grasp what “parole” means 
for purposes of extended term sentencing.  Cf. State v. David, 
149 Hawaiʻ i 469, 475-76, 494 P.3d 1202, 1208-09 (2021) (providing 
that 
blood alcohol levels and the association between excessive 
alcohol consumption and aggression are within the common 
knowledge and experience of ordinary jurors).  That is, “life 
with the possibility of parole” means the defendant may someday 
get out of prison.  And “life without the possibility of parole” 
means the defendant will never get out of prison.  So there is 
no reason to define or explain “parole.” *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
23 
 Second, a jury can only make a reasoned sentencing decision 
after a murder conviction if it knows about the parole option.  
The possibility of parole is the only difference between an 
extended sentence and an ordinary sentence for second-degree 
murder.  To make its “necessary for the protection of the 
public” finding, the jury needs to know that difference.  “There 
is no way that a jury could meaningfully make that decision 
without being informed of the difference between life with, and 
life without, the possibility of parole.”  Keohokapu, 127 Hawaiʻ i 
at 116, 276 P.3d at 685. (Recktenwald, C.J., dissenting in 
part).  
 Third, the Keohokapu footnote understates the ordinary 
statutory maximum for murder.  A “possible life term of 
imprisonment” compared to a “definite life term of imprisonment” 
suggests that a defendant will possibly get a sentence less than 
life.  At least one of twelve jurors may interpret a “possible 
life term of imprisonment” to mean a defendant might get a life 
sentence or they might get less than a life sentence.  A juror 
believing the latter may find the extended sentence is necessary because of a misplaced belief that the defendant would otherwise 
not receive a “life” sentence.  As Lafoga’s trial attorney put 
it:
 
[T]he phrase possible life term of imprisonment could leave 
the jury to think that there’s not going to be a life term 
of imprisonment.  If the jury is led to believe that there’s not going to be a life term of imprisonment, then *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
24 
 it’s –- it’s more likely that they will say that an 
extended term is necessary for the protection of the 
public. 
 
The Keohokapu dissent foresaw confusion and prejudice: “An 
interrogatory phrased in the manner suggested by the majority 
could lead a jury to reasonably infer that a sentence of ‘life’ 
means exactly what it says, e.g., that the defendant will remain 
imprisoned for the remainder of [their] life.  However, that 
inference would not necessarily be accurate, because a defendant 
such as Keohokapu would be eligible for parole.”  Keohokapu, 127 
Hawaiʻi at 123, 276 P.3d at 692. 
Here, we hold the extended term sentencing instructions and 
special interrogatories were prejudicially erroneous and 
misleading.  Stanley v. State, 148 Hawaiʻ i 489, 500-01, 479 P.3d 
107, 118-19 (2021).  We remand for resentencing on the 
defendants’ extended term sentences for attempted murder, and 
rule that this opinion only applies to Lafoga and Ines and cases 
that are on direct review or not yet final.  See Lewi v. State, 
145 Hawaiʻ i 333, 349 n.21, 452 P.3d 330, 346 n.21 (2019).  
IV. 
 
This case is remanded for a new extended term sentencing 
hearing and resentencing.  In all other respects the ICA’s June 
20, 2022 judgment on appeal, the circuit court’s February 20, 
2020 judgment of conviction and sentence for Lafoga, and the  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
25 
 circuit court’s September 2, 2020 amended judgment of conviction 
and sentence for Ines are affirmed.
