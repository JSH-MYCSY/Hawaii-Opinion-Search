On July 12, 2023, Petitioners/Plaintiffs-Appellants 
Aryn Nakaoka and Darcie Nakaoka (the Nakaokas) filed a motion 
for reconsideration of our July 7, 2023 summary disposition 
order affirming the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ (ICA) 
judgment in Nakaoka v. Shizuru, 151 Hawaiʻ i 510, 517 P.3d 783

2 Hawai
ʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 40(b) 
require motions for reconsideration to “state with particularity 
the points of law or fact that the moving party contends the court has overlooked or misapprehended.”  “[A] motion for 
reconsideration is not a vehicle for arguments that could have 
been presented earlier.”  Protect & Pres. Kahoma Ahupua
‘a Ass’n 
v. Maui Plan. Comm’n, No. SCWC-15-0000478, 2021 WL 2828030, at 
*1 (Haw. July 7, 2021).  “We again remind litigants that a 
motion for reconsideration is not the time to relitigate old 
matters.”  Briggs v. Hotel Corp. of Pac., Inc., 73 Haw. 276, 287 
n.7, 831 P.2d 1335, 1342 n.7 (1992). 
In their motion for reconsideration, the Nakaokas 
raise some new arguments and revisit some old ones.  The Nakaokas abandon their long-held theory that the mediation 
requirement in Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 508D-18 is 
jurisdictional and instead argue that the parties’ failure to 
mediate required dismissal of the case for failure to state a 
claim.  The Nakaokas have not raised this argument before, and it is not appropriately raised in a motion for reconsideration.
See Maui Plan. Comm’n, 2021 WL 2828030, at *1.  The Nakaokas’ 
argument that the attorneys’ fees award “should be equitably 
adjusted” simply repeats arguments made in the supplemental    
3 briefs and at oral argument,  and is, again, not appropriately 
raised in a motion for reconsideration.  See Briggs, 73 Haw. at 
287 n.7, 831 P.2d at 1342 n.7.  To the extent the Nakaokas raise 
waiver and estoppel arguments, those arguments are deemed 
waived. 1
Upon careful review of the motion for reconsideration, 
the record, the briefs submitted by the parties, including 
supplemental briefs, and also having heard oral argument on June 22, 2023,  
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion is denied. 
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai‘ i, July 17,  2023.

1  These arguments were, notably, omitted from their briefing in the 
ICA and in their application for certiorari.  The Nakaokas failed to convince 
us in their supplemental briefing and at oral argument that we should notice 
plain error pursuant to HRAP Rule 28(b)(4)(D).
