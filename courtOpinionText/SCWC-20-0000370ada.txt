 The Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) dismissed post-

We agree with the ICA that Suitt’s appeal was not properly

 defects stemmed from ineffective assistance of counsel, we hold 
that the ICA has jurisdiction to review the merits of Suitt’s 
appeal. 
I. 
 
In 2015, Suitt pled no contest to murder in the second 
degree.  The court sentenced him to life in prison with the 
possibility of parole.  Later, the Hawaiʻ i Paroling Authority 
(HPA) set Suitt’s minimum term at 45 years.  Suitt did not 
directly appeal his conviction, but six months later – on his 
own – filed a Hawaiʻ i Rules of Pen al Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40 
petition for post-conviction relief.  Suitt updated his hand-
written petition multiple times between 2016 and 2019.  In its 
final form, the petition claimed fifty-five grounds for relief.  
These claims included ineffective assistance of counsel as well as due process violations relating to the HPA minimum term 
hearing. 
Eventually, Suitt’s petition was heard in the Circuit Court 
of the First Circuit.  On March 16, 2020, the circuit court 
found that while most of Suitt’s claims were “patently 
frivolous” under HRPP Rule 40(g)(2), the claims relating to his 
minimum term hearing were colorable under Lewi v. State, 145 
  
“the HPA is required to set forth a written justification or 
explanation (beyond simply an enumeration of any or all of the 333, 348-
49, 452 P.3d 330, 345-46 (2019) (holding that Hawaiʻi*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 broad criteria considered) when it determines that the minimum 
term of imprisonment for the felony offender is to be set at a 
Level II or Level III punishment”).  The court then scheduled an 
evidentiary hearing on these claims for April 20, 2020.  It also 
appointed counsel for Suitt.  
On April 13, 2020, the court amended its previous order to 
address additional claims for relief added by Suitt – these were 
denied.  The amended order retained a footnote from the previous order mentioning that if the HPA held a new minimum term 
hearing, Suitt’s remaining claims would be mooted.

On May 12, 2020, Suitt’s counsel called Suitt and informed 
him, apparently for the first time, that the circuit court had 
denied all of his claims except for the ones relating to his 
minimum term sentencing.  He told Suitt that the next day was 
the last day he could appeal, that is, if he wanted to appeal. 
Suitt did.  Over the phone, Suitt told his attorney to 
appeal “any and all grounds the court denied.”  Then he 
 
1  The footnote stated: 
 
In the event HPA agrees to conduct a new minimum term 
hearing pursuant to State v. Lewi and appoints new 
substitute counsel for Petitioner, this would obviate the need for this court to conduct an evidentiary hearing on 
all of these grounds -- 4- 8, 24, 25, and 39, relating to 
the HPA minimum term hearing Level 3 determination, and Grounds 2- 3, 9, 26, 31, and 43, related ineffective 
assistance of counsel as to the HPA minimum term hearing.  
If HPA agreed to conduct a new minimum term hearing with new counsel, all of these claims would be rendered moot. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 memorialized this request in a letter to his attorney.   The day 
of the call, Suitt’s attorney submitted an appeal of the April 
13 Order.   However the proceedings had not yet concluded in the 
circuit court. 32
On May 14, 2020, the HPA responded to the April 13 Order.  
The HPA represented that it had scheduled a new minimum term hearing for Suitt, which mooted his remaining claims.
4  On May 
20, 2020, the circuit court issued a new order.  It dismissed 
 
2  Suitt’s letter read in relevant part: 
 
Greetings, in summary of our discussion on 5/12/2020, I 
have the following understandings: 
I was notified by you verbally that the court denied my 
grounds in my HRPP Rule 40 Petition, except for those 
relating to Levi vs State, and that 5/13/2020 was the last day I could appeal.  I expressed to you that I wanted to 
Appeal any and all grounds the court denied, grounds 1- 55 
of record under my HRPP Rule 40 Petition SPP. NO. 16-1-
0011.  I further had my brother Clayton text to you that I 
wanted an Appeal for all denied grounds on 5/13/2020.  I do 
appreciate that you notified of my right to appeal; the court denied the grounds without notification to me and I 
was “surprised” when you informed me of the denied grounds 
in my Rule 40.  You are well aware of my intention to 
exhaust state remedies and pursue Federal review of the 
actions of the First Circuit Court and its officers in my 
criminal case, as well as the procedures of the HPA which I 
believe are in violation of Constitutional and U.S. Supreme 
Court law. 
 
3  Suitt’s counsel submitted an amended appeal on the next day, May 13.  
The changes are irrelevant to this appeal.  Counsel included the words 
“court-appointed” and attached the order appointing him. 
 
4  The HPA’s response stated: 
 
In this case, the HPA has scheduled a new minimum term 
hearing.  The claims against the HPA in the instant 
petition are therefore moot because this court can no 
longer grant the effective relief.  Accordingly, the 
remaining claims against HPA should be dismissed, with the 
corresponding evidentiary hearing set for May 26, 2020 for these claims should be vacated. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
5 
 the remaining claims in the petition as moot and vacated the 
scheduled evidentiary hearing. 
Suitt’s counsel didn’t file a notice of appeal from the May 
20 Order.  And he didn’t file an opening brief for his appeal of 
the April 13 Order.  Nor did he ask the court for an extension.  
On August 28, the ICA warned Suitt’s counsel that the time to 
file the briefs had expired and that the appeal could be 
dismissed under Hawaiʻ i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 
30.  Almost a month later, on September 24, Suitt’s counsel 
submitted a motion asking for a temporary remand to the circuit 
court so that he could withdraw as counsel there.  In the same 
motion, Suitt’s counsel sought an extension of time on the opening brief.  The ICA construed this as a request for relief 
from the defaulted opening brief and granted both parts of the 
motion.  On November 16, Suitt’s counsel filed a motion to 
withdraw in the circuit court.  The circuit court promptly 
granted his motion and Suitt’s current counsel was appointed.
 
On May 31, 2022, the ICA dismissed Suitt’s appeal for lack 
of appellate jurisdiction because the appeal had not been taken from a final order.  It found that neither HRAP Rule 4(b)(4)’s 
Premature Notice exception nor the exceptions identified in *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

Suitt appealed.  Suitt argues that the April 13 Order was 
in fact a final order. 
As a question of law, the existence of jurisdiction is 
reviewed de novo under the right/wrong standard.  See Lingle v. 
Hawaiʻi Gov’t Emps. Ass’n, AFSCME, Local 152, AFL-CIO, 107 
Hawaiʻi 178, 182, 111 P.3d 587, 591 (2005). 
II. 
  The right of appeal derives from statute.  See Chambers v. 
Leavey, 60 Haw. 52, 56, 587 P.2d 807, 810 (1978).  In this case, 
HRPP Rule 40(h) authorizes defendants to appeal judgments 
entered in post-conviction proceedings.  Such appeals must 
comply with HRAP Rule 4(b), and like all appeals, are subject to 
 a finality requirement.  See State v. Baranco, 77 Hawaiʻi 351, 
 
5  The ICA stated: 
 
In an appeal from a circuit- court proceeding involving an 
HRPP Rule 40 petition for post- conviction relief, 
we have permitted belated appeals under two 
sets of circumstances, namely, when (1) defense 
counsel has inexcusably or ineffectively failed 
to pursue a defendant’ s appeal from a criminal 
conviction in the first instance, or (2) the lower court’ s decision was unannounced and no 
notice of the entry of judgment was ever provided. 
Grattafiori, 79 Hawaiʻ i at 13– 14, 897 P.2d at 940– 41 
(citation omitted).  However, neither exception applies to the instant case. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

489, 403 P.3d 259, 266 (2017).  482, Hawaiʻi 
A final order “means an order ending the proceedings, 
leaving nothing further to be accomplished.”  Familian 
Northwest, Inc. v. Cent. Pac. Boiler & Piping, Ltd., 68 Haw. 
368, 370, 714 P.2d 936, 937 (1986); see also State v. Kalani, 87 
Hawaiʻi 260, 261, 953 P.2d 1358, 1359 (1998) (assuming that 
“final order” has the same meaning in the civil and criminal 
context).  An order is not final “if the matter is retained for 
further action.”  Familian Northwest, 68 Haw. at 370, 714 P.2d 
at 937.  
We agree with the ICA that the April 13 Order was not 
final.  The order did not end the Rule 40 proceeding; it scheduled a further proceeding — an evidentiary hearing on several of Suitt’s grounds for relief.  It was not until the May 
20, 2020 order, which vacated the hearing and dismissed the 
remaining claims, that the court fully resolved Suitt’s claims 
for the purpose of appeal.  
Rule 4(b) does contain an exception.  A notice of appeal 
“filed after the announcement of a decision, sentence or order 
but before entry of the judgment or order” is treated as if it 
were filed after entry of the order.  HRAP Rule 4(b)(4).  In the 
prototypical example, a judge delivers an oral order, with some time elapsing before the order is formally entered.  See, e.g., *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
8 
 Shimabuku v. Montgomery Elevator Co., 79 Hawaiʻ i 352, 356, 903 
P.2d 48, 52 (1995).  The Premature Notice of Appeal exception 
prevents technicality from displacing substance.  If a final order has been clearly communicated by the court, parties should 
not be penalized for appealing before that order is formally 
entered.  This exception, though, does not remove the 
requirement that the order announced be a final one.  See 
Grattafiori, 79 Hawaiʻ i at 14, 897 P.2d at 941 (holding that HRAP
Rule 4(b)(4) does not apply when “the court has rendered no decision whatsoever”); see also Wong v. Takeuchi, 83 Hawaiʻ i 94, 
101, 924 P.2d 588, 595 (App. 1996).  
Here, no final order was announced prior to the May 20 
Order.  It is true that the April 13 Order foreshadows the 
case’s ultimate disposition.  Footnote 3 of the order notes that 
the HPA could moot Suitt’s remaining claims by setting a new 
hearing.  This is precisely what the HPA did.  But at the time 
Suitt’s appeal was filed, he had no way of knowing what action 
the HPA would take.  And a court indicating what it would most likely do, if one of the parties were to act in a certain way, 
is too indefinite and conditional to constitute the announcement 
of a final order.   
Because the April 13 Order was not final and does not fall 
within the HRAP Rule 4(b)(4) exception, the appeal did not give 
rise to appellate jurisdiction. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 However, the April 13 Order’s lack of finality is not the 
end of the story.  Hawaiʻ i appellate courts permit belated 
appeals when defense counsel has acted inexcusably or 
ineffectively in pursuing an appeal.  See Grattafiori, 79 Hawaiʻ i 
at 14, 897 P.2d at 941.  The ICA did not think this exception 
applied to Suitt’s case, perhaps because Grattafiori appears to 
confine the exception to appeals “in the first instance.”  Id. 
While Suitt did not contest this point in his cert application, we raise it due to its constitutional significance.  See State 
v. Pitts, 131 Hawaiʻ i 537, 541, 319 P.3d 456, 460 (2014).  Here, 
we part ways with the ICA’s analysis. 
Since Grattafiori, we have decided several key ineffective 
assistance of counsel cases.  These cases make clear that the 
right to effective counsel goes further than appeals in the 
first instance.  See, e.g., State v. Uchima, 147 Hawaiʻ i 64, 76, 
464 P.3d 852, 864 (2020) (holding that a defendant has a right 
to the effective assistance of counsel during certiorari 
review). 
Maddox v. State, 141 Hawaiʻ i 196, 407 P.3d 152 (2017) is on 
point.  In Maddox, we considered an appeal rendered untimely by 
the procedural lapses of defense counsel.  We began with the 
basic premise that defendants have a right to counsel under 
article I, section 14 of the Hawaiʻ i Constitution.  To vindicate 
this right, counsel have “an ongoing obligation to [the *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
10 
 defendant] that include[s] pursuing an appeal if [the defendant] 
chose this course.”  Id. at 203, 407 P.3d at 159.  This right to 
counsel encompasses “the procedural steps necessary to bring 
about the appeal.”  Id.  It follows that defense counsel have a 
“duty to diligently fulfill the procedural requirements of 
appeal if the defendant elects to appeal.”  Id.  When counsel’s 
procedural failures deny the defendant an appeal, the defendant 
“need not demonstrate any additional possibility of impairment to establish that counsel was ineffective.”  Id. at 206, 407 
P.3d at 162.  
Suitt made clear that he wanted to exercise his statutory 
right to appeal the dismissal of his Rule 40 claims.  Not 
content to communicate this to his attorney over the phone, he 
repeated his intent in writing.  Of course, Suitt could not have 
been expected to know that his attorney had given him inaccurate 
information.  May 13 was not the last day Suitt had to appeal — 
rather, any appeal would lack jurisdiction until all the grounds in the petition had been disposed of by the court.  
We presume prejudice to Suitt from his counsel’s failure to 
take the procedural steps necessary to kick-start an appeal that 
Suitt clearly desired.  
The appropriate remedy is consideration of the appeal on 
 
(noting that proceeding to the merits when the failure to timely Hawai 
ʻiat 80-81, 464 P.3d at 868-69 its merits.  See Uchima, 147 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
11 
 file results from the ineffective assistance of counsel prevents 
“unnecessary delay to the defendant whose rights have been 
adversely affected”).  We also clarify that the exception 
outlined in Grattafiori for untimely appeals based on 
ineffective counsel is not confined to appeals in the first 
instance.  It covers any instance where ineffective counsel has 
nullified a defendant’s statutory right of appeal. 
III. 
For the reasons stated above, we vacate the ICA’s May 31, 
2022 Order and remand this case to the ICA to address the merits 
of the appeal.
