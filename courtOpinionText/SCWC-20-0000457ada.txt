Dkt. 23 OPA***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 2  Logovii Talo (“Talo”)’s probation was revoked after a 
warrantless search by probation officers recovered a firearm and 
ammunition from his home.   
 After acceptance of certiorari, this court ordered 
supplemental briefing pursuant to Hawaiʻi Rules of Appe llate 
Procedure (“HRAP”) Rule 28(b)(4)(D) (2022),1 asking whether the 
imposition of special condition Q was consistent with Hawaiʻi 
Revised Statutes (“HRS”) § 706 -624(2) (2016) and this court’s 
holding in    State v. Kahawai , 103 Hawaiʻi 462, 83 P.3d 72 5 (2004).  
Kahawai held that a sentencing court may not impose 
discretionary conditions of probation pursuant to  HRS § 706–
624(2) unless there is a factual basis in t he record indicating 
that such conditions are reasonably related to the factors set 
forth in HRS § 706–606 (2014) and that they only involve 
deprivations of liberty or property reasonably necessary for the 
purposes indicated in HRS § 706 -606(2).  Kahawai, 103 Hawaiʻi at 
462-63, 83 P.3d at 725 -26.    
 
1  HRAP Rule 28(b)(4)(D) provides in relevant part:  
 
[T]he appellate court, at its option, may notice a plain 
error not presented.  If an appellate court, when acting on 
a case on appeal, contemplates basing the disposition of 
the case wholly or in part upon an issue of plain error not 
raised by the parties through briefing, it shall not 
affirm, reverse, or vacate the case without allowing the 
parties the opportunity to brief the potential plain -error 
issue prior to disposition.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 3  We hold that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion 
by imposing special con dition Q because Talo was convicted of a 
felony and a crime of violence, which prohibited him from owning 
or possessing firearms and ammunition, and because he had notice 
that “contraband” would include such items.  We therefore affirm 
the Intermediate Cou rt of Appeals’ (“ICA”) June 30, 2022 
judgment on appeal.   
II. Background  
 
A.  Factual background  
 
 On the morning of September 11, 2015, Talo went to Rent -A-
Center in Wahiawā.  When an employee told Talo the store was 
closed, Talo forced his way in and repeatedly punched and struck 
the employee, then threatened to kill him if he called the 
police.  The employee  suffered a concussion, lacerated lip and 
buccal cavity, and a cerv ical strain.    
B.  Circuit court proceedings  
 
 On June 29, 2017, Talo ple d no contest to assault in the 
second degree  in violation of HRS § 707 -711(1)(a) and/or (b ) ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 4  (2016).2  Relevant here, t he circuit court3 sentenced Talo to 
four years of probation with special terms and conditions.    
 A probation officer reviewed the terms and conditions of 
probation with Talo on July 20, 2017.  Talo signed the probation 
conditions form, acknowledging he understood the conditions.  
Talo’s pre-sentence report (“PSI”) indicated that he did not 
have any registered firearms, but the probation conditions form 
contained a standard warning that Talo was “prohibited from 
owning or possessing any firearm or ammunition pursuant to HRS § 
134-7.”  Special condition B also prohibited Talo from  owning or 
possessing any firearms or ammunition.  Additionally, special 
condition Q provided that Talo was to:4  
Q. Submit at reasonable times to a search of your 
person, residence, vehicle, or other sites and p roperty 
under your control by any probation officer, with or 
without a warrant, based on reasonable suspicion that 
illicit substances(s) or other contraband, may be in the 
places(s)of a search.  Any  
  
 
2  HRS § 707 -711(1)(a) and (b) (2016) provided:  
 
(1) A person commits the offense of assault in the second degree if:  
(a) The person intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes  
substantial bodily injury to another;  
(b) The person recklessly causes serious bodily injury to another[.]  
 
3   The Honorable Karen T. Nakasone presided.  
 
4  Talo’s special condition Q was based on HRS § 706 -624(2)(q), which 
provides:  
 
(q) Submit to a sea rch by any probation officer, with or 
without a warrant, of the defendant's person, residence, 
vehicle, or other sites or property under the defendant's 
control, based upon the probation officer's reasonable 
suspicion that illicit substances or contraband may be 
found on the person or in the place to be searched [.] ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 5 illicit substances(s) or contraband found or observed in 
such a search may be seized [.] 
 
 Two years later, i n June and July of 2019, Talo’s wife , 
Jenifer Talo (“Jenifer”) , filed two domestic abuse temporary 
restraining order petitions against Talo (“TRO petitions”) .  
Jenifer alleged in both petitions that Talo may own, possess, or 
have access to a weapo n.   
Both petitions were ultimately dissolved.   On September 30, 
2019, however, a sergeant from the Honolulu Police Department 
(“HPD”) contacted probation supervisor Eleanor Kekauoha 
(“Kekauoha”) to inform her  that Jenifer and the Talos’  son had 
reported that Talo had a firearm.  Kekauoha opened a probation 
violation investigation for prohibited possession of a firearm.  
On October 1, 2019, Kekauoha spoke to Jenifer regarding the 
location of the firearm and ammunition.  Kekauoha then reviewed 
Jenifer’s  TRO petitions.   Kekauoha again spoke to Jenifer on 
October 14, 2019, to set up a meeting, which finally occurred on 
November 19, 2019.   During this meeting, Kekauoha and assistant 
probation  supervisor Brooke Mamizuka obtained more details from 
Jenifer and her son regarding the firearm and ammunition in the 
home.   
 Based on this information, probation officers conducted a  
warrantless search of Talo’s home and car on December 6, 2019. 
Probation officers found a firearm wrapped in a lavalava under 
the mattress of Talo’s bed, in his  bedroom.  They also located ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 6 ammunition in an adjacent laundry basket in the same room. 
Because probation officers do not handle or store weapons, HPD 
officers were present and were called upon to handle the firearm 
and ammunition.   A motion to revoke Talo’s probation was filed 
the same day.  
At the January 16, 2020 initial hearing on the mot ion to 
revoke, Talo orally moved to exclude or suppress all evidence 
gathered as a result of the warrantless search .  He asserted the 
search had been a subterfuge to have probation officers conduct 
a warrantless search for later criminal prosecution, which  is 
prohibited by State v. Propios , 76 Hawaiʻi 474, 480, 879 P.2d 
1057, 106 3 (1994).  Various witnesses then testified over 
several days in a consolidated hearing on the motions.  
On March 12, 2020, t he circuit court denied Talo’s motion 
to suppress, concluding the probation officers had specific and 
articulable facts to support a reasonable suspicion to conduct a 
warrantless search of Talo’s home and car .  The court concluded 
the search was properly conducted for probation purposes, for 
public safety, and the rehabilitative goals of probation. HPD 
stopped its criminal investigation when the prosecutor’s offic e 
indicated it would not be pursuing criminal charges .  The 
circuit court therefore determined the search was not a 
subterfuge or a ruse for criminal prosecution  and was not for an  
HPD investigation.   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 7  On June 18, 2020, the circuit court granted the motion for 
revocation of probation and resentenced Talo  to five years of 
imprisonment with credit for time served.   
C.  ICA proceedings  
  
 On July 16, 2020, Talo filed a notice of appeal  to the ICA .  
Talo asserted: (1) the circuit court erred in denying Talo’s 
motion to suppress because the probation search was merely a 
subterfuge for later criminal prosecution in violation of 
Propios, 76 Hawaiʻi at 480, 879 P.2d at 1063; and (2) the circuit 
court abused its discretion in sentencing Talo to an open term 
of imprisonment of five years.   
 The ICA concluded  there was no indication that police and 
probation officers colluded  to gather evidence for a new 
criminal prosecution aga inst Talo; rather the purpose of the 
warrantless search was to investigate a possible probation 
violation.   The ICA further held the circuit court properly 
considered the factors in HRS §§ 706 -621 (2014)5 and 706-606, 
 
5  HRS § 706 -621 Factors to be co nsidered in imposing a term of probation.   
The court, in determining whether to impose a term of probation, shall 
consider:  
 
(1) The factors set forth in section 706 -606 to the extent 
that they are applicable;  
(2) The following factors, to be accorded weight in favor 
of withholding a sentence of imprisonment:  
(a) The defendant's criminal conduct neither caused nor  
threatened serious harm;  
(b) The defendant acted under a strong provocation;  
(c) There were substantial grounds tending to excuse or 
justify the defendant's criminal conduct, though 
failing to establish a defense;  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 8  including the nature and circumstance s of the offense, Talo’s 
history and characteristics, and public safety concerns.  The 
ICA therefore held the circuit court did not abuse its 
discretion in re -sentencing Talo to a five -year term of 
imprisonment.   
D. Certiorari proceedings  
 
 Talo filed an application for writ of certiorari raising 
the same legal issues he raised before the ICA.  Although we 
agree with the ICA that the issues Talo raised lack merit, w e 
accepted certiorari  to address whether the circuit court erred 
in imposing the  warrantless  search probation condition in the 
first instance.   
 
(d) The victim of the defendant's criminal conduct 
induced or facilitated its commission;  
(e) The defendant has no history of prior delinquency 
or criminal activity or has led a law -abiding life for 
a substantial  period of time before the commission of 
the present crime;  
(f) The defendant's criminal conduct was  the result of  
circumstances unlikely to recur;  
(g) The character and attitudes of the defendant 
indicate that the defendant is unlikely to commit 
another crime;  
(h) The defendant is particularly likely to respond 
affirmatively to a program of restitutio n or a 
probationary program or both;  
(i) The imprisonment of the defendant would entail 
excessive hardship to the defendant or the defendant's 
dependents; and  
(j) The expedited sentencing program set forth in 
section 706 -606.3, if the defendant has quali fied for 
that sentencing program.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 9  We therefore ordered supplemental briefing on the question 
of whether the imposition of special condition Q was  consistent 
with HRS § 706 -624(2) and this court’s holding in   Kahawai. 
III. Standard of Review  
 
A sentencing judge generally has broad discretion in 
imposing a sentence.  The applicable standard of review for 
sentencing or resentencing matters is whether the court 
committed plain and manifest abuse of discretion in its 
decision.  Factors which indicate a plain and manifest 
abuse of discretion are arbitrary or capricious action by 
the judge and a rigid refusal to consider the defendant's 
contentions.  And, generally, to constitute an abuse it 
must appear that the court clearly excee ded the bounds of 
reason or disregarded rules or principles of law or 
practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant.  
 
State v. Mundon , 121 Hawaiʻi 339, 349, 219 P.3d 1126, 1136 (2009) 
(quoting State v. Kahapea , 111 Hawaiʻi 267, 278, 141 P.3d 44 0, 
451 (2006)).  
IV. Discussion  
 
A. Applicable law  
 
Before addressing the parties’ supplemental briefs, w e 
summarize Kahawai and other law relevant to issues on 
certiorari.  
In State v. Fields , 67 Haw. 268, 686 P.2d 1379 (1984) , we 
balanced a probation condition allowing warrantless searches by 
probation officers against a defendant’s constitutional rights. 
Defendant Shirley Fields (“Fields”) was convicted of three drug 
charges and sentenced to probation.  67 Haw. at 279, 686 P. 2d at 
1388.  A condition of probation made her “subject at all 
times . . . to a warrantless search of her person, property and ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 10 place of residence for illicit drugs and substances by any law 
enforcement officer including her probation officer.”  67 Haw. 
at 271, 686 P.2d at 1383-84.  Before any search pursuant to that 
condition occurred, Fields challenged it on appeal.  67 Haw. at 
273, 686 P.2d at 1384. 
We noted that defendants sentenced to probation, like those 
on parole or in prison, are subject to limitati ons from which 
ordinary persons are free.  67 Haw. at 277, 686 P.2d at 1387.  
We pointed out, however, that a defendant on probation still has 
the right to enjoy a significant degree of privacy.  67 Haw. at 
279, 686 P.2d at 1388.  We recognized that our st ate 
constitution explicitly protects people against unreasonable 
searches, seizures, and invasions of privacy.6  67 Haw. at 282, 
686 P.2d at 1390.  We explained that while a warrantless search 
condition might serve the probationary goal of protecting the 
public, it was doubtful that a near-total surrender of privacy  
would be reasonably related to Fields’ rehabilitation.  67 Haw. 
at 278, 686 P.2d at 1387-88.  
 
6 We cited to Article I, section 7 of the Constitution of the State of 
Hawai‘i, 67 Haw. at 282 n.10 , 686 P.2d at 1391 n. 10, which  provides:  
 
The right of the people to be secure in their persons, 
houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches, 
seizures and invasions of privacy shall not be violated; 
and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, 
supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly 
describing the place to be searched and the persons or 
things to be seized or the communications sought to be 
intercepted.   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 11  We also pointed out that probation conditions must 
contribute to the rehabilitation of the defendant, 67 Haw. at 
278, 686 P.2d at 1387, and we discussed the role of probation 
officers.  A probation officer has been described as a social 
therapist in an authoritative setting.  67 Haw. at 280, 686 P.2d 
at 1388.  The officer must monitor a probationer’s life and help 
them safely reintegrate  into the community.  Id.  Thus, we 
reasoned that a probation officer has a unique interest in 
invading a supervised defendant’s privacy and that given the 
officer’s necessary involvement in a supervised person’s life, 
there is a diminished expectation of privacy.  67 Haw. at 280, 
686 P.2d at 1389.   
Because of Fields’s known involvement in drug trafficking, 
we concluded a condition allowing warrantless searches by her 
probation officer could serve a legitimate correctional purpose 
and contribute to her reh abilitation.7  67 Haw. at 280, 686 P.2d 
at 1388.  We held, however, that such a condition would be  
unreasonable unless it required “specific and articulable facts 
giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that illicit drugs are 
concealed on the person, in the property, or at the place of 
 
7  We distinguished between a probation officer , whose responsibility is 
to monitor a probationer , and a police officer , who seeks to investigate and 
prosecute criminal activity .  67 Haw. at 280, 686 P.2d at 1388.  We concluded 
that warrantless searches at the whim of police officers were unlikely to be 
rehabilitative and unduly restrictive of a probationer’s liberty .  Id. ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 12 residence” of t he defendant.8  67 Haw. at 281, 686 P.2d at 1389.  
Because the probation condition was not so limited, we vacated 
the sentence and remanded for resentencing consistent with our 
opinion.   67 Haw. at 282, 686 P.2d 13 90. 
Then, in State v. Lee , 10 Haw.  App. 192, 862 P.2d 295 
(1993), the ICA held that a defendant's probation may not be 
revoked for failure to comply with a special condition of 
probation when he was never provided with written notice of that 
condition, as required by  HRS § 706-624(3) (Supp. 1992).  10 
Haw. App. at 19 2, 862 P.2d at 295 -96.  HRS § 706 -624(3) then 
(and still) provides as follows:  
(3)  Written statement of conditions.   The court shall 
order the defendant at the time of sentencing to sign a 
written acknowledgment of receipt of conditions of 
probation.   The defendant shall be given a written copy of 
any requirements imposed pursuant to this section, stated 
with sufficient specificity to enable the defendant to 
comply wi th the conditions accordingly.  
 
The ICA discussed the Commentary to HRS § 706 –624, which  
indicate s that the written notice requirement “is an addition to 
the law suggested by the Model Penal Code and accepted in other 
states.  The intent is to provide the  defendant with notice of 
what is expected of him in a form which will not escape his 
memory.”  Lee, 10 Haw. App. at 198, 862 P.2d  at 298.  
 The next year, we held that despite the existence of 
specific and articulable facts providing reasonable suspicion of 
 
8  The existence of such required facts is not at issue in Talo’s case.   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 13 a probation violation, a warrantless search by probation 
officers can be invalid if its true purpose is future criminal 
prosecution.  Propios, 76 Hawaiʻi at 487,  879 P.2d at 1070.  We 
held the search in question unreasonable “because the avowed 
purpose was in reality a subterfuge designed to facilitate a 
criminal investigation,” as police took over a search nominally 
conducted by probation officers to gather evide nce for use in a 
criminal prosecution , which actually occurred.   76 Hawaiʻi at 
480-81, 879 P.2d at 1063 -64.  
 Finally, Kahawai involved a defendant convicted of 
violating a protective order.  103 Hawaiʻi at 463, 83 P.3d at 
726.  The State requested an alco hol and substance abuse 
assessment and treatment, as necessary, as conditions of 
probation.  Id.  The State argued that if a PSI had been 
completed, various parties would have attested to the necessity 
for such assessment and treatment .  Id.  Despite Kahawai’s 
assertions that nothing in the record warranted such conditions , 
the court imposed special conditions relating to alcohol and 
substance abuse.  Id.   
 On certiorari, we held a sentencing court has discretion to 
impose the conditions set forth in HRS §  706-624(2),9 but that 
 
9  HRS § 706 -624(2) now provides:  
 
(2)  Discretionary conditions.   The court may provide, as 
further conditions of a sentence of probation, to the 
extent that the conditions are reas onably related to the ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 14  
factors set forth in section 706 -606 and to the extent that 
the conditions involve only deprivations of liberty or 
property as are reasonably necessary for the purposes 
indicated in section 706 -606(2), that the defendant:  
(a)  Serve a term of imprisonment to be determined by  the 
court at sentencing in class A felony cases under section 
707-702, not exceeding two years in class A felony cases 
under part IV of chapter 712, not exceeding eighteen months 
in class B felony cases, not exceed ing one year in class C 
felony cases, not exceeding six months in misdemeanor 
cases, and not exceeding five days in petty misdemeanor 
cases; provided that notwithstanding any other provision of 
law, any order of imprisonment under this subsection that 
provides for prison work release shall require the 
defendant to pay thirty per cent of the defendant's gross 
pay earned during the prison work release period to satisfy 
any restitution order.   The payment shall be handled by the 
adult probation division and sh all be paid to the victim on 
a monthly basis;  
(b)  Perform a specified number of hours of services to the 
community as described in section 706 -605(1)(d);  
(c)  Support the defendant's dependents and meet other 
family responsibilities;  
(d)  Pay a fine imposed pursuant to section 706 -605(1)(b);  
(e)  Work conscientiously at suitable employment or pursue 
conscientiously a course of study or vocational training 
that will equip the defendant for suitable employment;  
(f)  Refrain from engaging in a specified occupation, 
business, or profession bearing a reasonably direct 
relationship to the conduct constituting the crime or 
engage in the specified occupation, business, or profession 
only to a stated degree or under stated circumstances;  
(g)  Refrain from frequ enting specified kinds of places or 
from associating unnecessarily with specified persons, 
including the victim of the crime, any witnesses, 
regardless of whether they actually testified in the 
prosecution, law enforcement officers, co -defendants, or 
other individuals with whom contact may adversely affect 
the rehabilitation or reformation of the person convicted;  
(h)  Refrain from use of alcohol or any use of narcotic 
drugs or controlled substances without a prescription;  
(i)  Refrain from possessing a fir earm, ammunition, 
destructive device, or other dangerous weapon;  
(j)  Undergo available medical or mental health assessment 
and treatment, including assessment and treatment for 
substance abuse dependency, and remain in a specified 
facility if required for  that purpose;  
(k)  Reside in a specified place or area or refrain from 
residing in a specified place or area;  
(l)  Submit to periodic urinalysis or other similar testing 
procedure;  
(m)  Refrain from entering specified geographical areas 
without the court' s permission;  
(n)  Refrain from leaving the person's dwelling place 
except to go to and from the person's place of employment, ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 15    the discretion is not without limits.  103 Hawaiʻi at 465, 83 
P.3d at 728.  We held:  
A sentencing court may not impose discretionary conditions 
of probation pursuant to HRS § 706 -624(2)(1993) unless 
there is a factual basis in the record indicating that such 
conditions are reasonably related to the factors set forth 
in HRS § 706 -606 and insofar as such conditions involve 
only deprivations of liberty or property that they are 
reasonably necessary for the purposes indicated in HRS  § 
706-606(2).10 
 
the office of the person's physician or dentist, the 
probation office, or any other location as may be approved 
by the person's probation officer pursuant to court 
order.  As used in this paragraph, "dwelling place" 
includes the person's yard or, in the case of condominiums, 
the common elements;  
       (o)  Comply with a specified curfew;  
       (p)  Submit to monitoring b y an electronic monitoring  
 device; 
  (q)  Submit to a search by any probation officer, with  
  or without a warrant, of the defendant's person, residence,  
  vehicle, or other sites or property under the defendant's   
  control, based upon the probation officer's reasonable suspicion  
  that illicit substances or contraband may be found on the person  
  or in the place to be searched;  
  (r)  Sign a waiver of extradition and pay extradition  
  costs as determined and ordered by the court;

            (a)  To reflect the seriousness of the offense, to  
promote respect for law, and to provide just 
punishment for the offense;  
(b)  To afford adequate deterrence to criminal  
conduct;  
(c)  To protect the public from further crimes of the  
defendant; and  
(d)  To provide the defendant with needed educational  
or vocational training, medical care, or other

103 Hawaiʻi at 462-63, 83 P.3d at 7 25-26 (cleaned up) .  
 We noted that a sentencing court is not limited to any 
particular source of information  when imposing probationary 
conditions, as long as some factual basis for imposing such 
conditions exists in the record.  103 Hawaiʻi at 465-66, 83 P.3d 
at 728-29.  We agreed with Kahawai, however, that the sentencing 
court had no basis for imposing conditions related to substance 
abuse when t here was no fa ctual basis in the record for such 
conditions .  103 Hawaiʻi at 466, 83 P.3d at 7 29.  Accordingly, we 
remanded the case for resentencing.   103 Hawaiʻi at 468, 83 P.3d 
at 731.  
B.  Supplemental brief s 
 
 As noted, we ordered supplemental briefing on the question 
of whether the imposition of sp ecial condition Q was  consistent 
with HRS § 706 -624(2) and this court’s holding in   Kahawai.  
1. State’s arguments  
 
The State argues the imposition of special condition Q was 
consistent with HRS § 706 -624(2) and Kahawai because,  as a 
convicted felon, Talo could not possess firearms or ammunition, 
and doing so would violate his probation and also constitute a 
felony.  The State posits: 
[S]pecial condition Q is directly related to factors such 
as “afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,” and 
“protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.”  
Special condition Q is directly relevant and related to the ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 17  overall goal of probat ion to provide rehabilitation to the 
probationer and protect the public from any criminal 
activity.  
 
The State thus contends special condition Q was consistent 
with Kahawai.  It points out Kahawai involved improperly imposed 
drug and substance abuse condition s despite the lack of any drug 
history in the record .  103 Hawai ‘i at 466, 83 P.3d at 729.  In 
contrast, the State argues, Talo ’s conviction for a violent 
felony resulted in substantial injuries .  The State also asserts 
special condition Q directl y relates to the factors in HRS § 
706-606, and the overall rehabilitation of Talo.  In summary, 
the State contends special condition Q served a valid 
rehabilitative purpose and was reasonably related to Talo’s 
probation condition prohibiting him from posse ssing firearms and 
ammunition  based on his felony conviction .11   
 
  
  
 
11  The State also asserts that although Talo’s crime did not involve use 
of a firearm, special condition Q was reasonably related to his proclivity 
towards violent aggressive conduct and also to future criminality .  The State 
cites a California case, People v. Balestra , 90 Cal.Rptr.2d 77 ( Cal. 1999), 
in support.  Balestra  held the trial court did not abuse its discretion in 
imposing a warrantless s earch condition in an elder -abuse case that did not 
involve narcotics, theft, or firearms.  Balestra , 90 Cal.Rptr.2d at 80, 82 .  
The court ruled that “warrantless search conditions serve a valid 
rehabilitative purpose, and because such a search condition is necessarily 
justified by its rehabilitative purpose, it  is of no moment whether the 
underlying offense is reasonably related to theft, narcotics, or firearms.”  
90 Cal.Rptr.2d at 82.   
 This holding, however, violates Kahawai’s requirement of factual basis 
in the record for imposition discretionary  conditions.  103 Hawaii at 466, 83 
P.3d at 729.  Therefore, it is not persuasive.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 18 2. Talo’s arguments  
 
Talo argues the circuit court illegally imposed special 
condition Q because there was no factual basis in the record or 
in the nature of the charge that supported the condition.   
Talo argues that, i n Fields, this court validated a 
warrantless search proba tionary condition because of the 
defendant’ s known proclivity for involvement in the trafficking 
of illicit drugs.  67 Haw. at 280, 686 P.2d at 1389.  Talo also  
argues that , in Propios, this court implicit ly upheld a 
warrantless search condition based on t he probationer ’s drug 
offense conviction and her history of drug use.  76 Hawaiʻi at 
481, 879 P.2d at 1064.   
 Talo argues that , in contrast , there is nothing in the 
record that supports the imposition of any warrantless search 
condition.   Talo points out there was no weapon involved and 
that his blood alcohol content after the incident was .000%.   
Talo also asserts this was his only conviction and that he has 
never been arrested or charged with offenses involving drugs, 
alcohol, or other co ntraband.   Talo also points to the statement 
in his PSI that he ha s never experimented with illegal 
substances and has not consumed alcohol in three to four years.    
In summary, Talo argues special condition Q  should not have 
been imposed because there was  nothing in the nature and 
circumstances of the underlying offense or Talo ’s history and ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 19 characteristics that suggested the condition was necessary.  He 
argues his felony conviction , without more,  is insufficient to 
support the imposition of special condition Q.  Furthermore, 
Talo claims that the nature of the charge itself, assault in the 
second degree, does not indicate  the use of illicit substances 
or contraband that would support special condit ion Q.   
C. Analysis  
 
 For the reasons discussed below, we hold t he circuit court 
did not abuse its discretion by  imposing special condition Q. 
 1. Special condition Q is reasonably related to the   
  factors in HRS § 706 -606(2) and is consistent with  
  Kahawai 
 
As recognized in Kahawai, a trial court has discretion to 
impose special conditions of probation pursuant to  HRS § 706–
624(2) that are reasonably related to the factors set forth in 
section 706 -606, but only to the extent that the conditions 
involve deprivations of liberty re asonably necessary for the 
purposes indicated in section 706 -606(2).  Kahawai, 103 Hawaiʻi 
at 465, 83 P.3d at 728.   And pursuant to Kahawai, a factual 
basis for imposing special conditions of probation must inhere 
in the record.12  103 Hawaiʻi at 466, 83 P.3d at 729.  
 
12  Although no  longer at issue due to the revocation of probation, based 
on the applicable law discussed in Section IV.A, we agree with Talo that 
special conditions M, N, O, and P, relating to alcohol and drug /paraphernalia 
possession, use, consumption, testing, assessment, and treatment, if 
necessary, were improperly imposed on him.   The record does not reflect that 
Talo had drug or alcohol  issues.  The imposition of these conditions violated 
Kahawai. ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 20  
 At issue in this case is special condition Q.  HRS § 706 -
624(2) provides in relevant part:  
(2) Discretionary conditions.  The court may provide, as 
further conditions of a sentence of probation, to the 
extent that the conditions are reasonably related to the 
factors set forth in section 706 -606 and to the extent that 
the conditions involve only deprivations of liberty or 
property as are reasonably necessary for the purposes 
indicated in section 706 -606(2), that the defendant:  
. . . . 
(q) Submit to a search by any probation officer, with or 
without a warrant, of the defendant’s person, residence, 
vehicle, or other sites or property under the defendant’s 
control, based upon the probation officer’s reasonable 
suspicion that illicit su bstances or contraband may be 
found on the person or in the place to be searched[.]  
 
 HRS § 706 -606, referred to in HRS § 706 -624(2), 
provides:  
The court, in determining the particular sentence to be 
imposed, shall consider:  
 
(1) The nature and circumstances o f the offense and the 
history and characteristics of the defendant;  
(2) The need for the sentence imposed:  
(a) To reflect the seriousness of the offense, to 
promote respect for law, and to provide just 
punishment for the offense;  
(b) To afford adequate deterrence to criminal 
conduct;  
(c) To protect the public from further crimes of the 
defendant; and  
(d) To provide the defendant with needed educational 
or vocational training, medical care, or other 
correctional treatment in the most effective 
manner; 
(3) The kinds o f sentences available; and  
(4) The need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities 
among defendants with similar records who have been 
found guilty of similar conduct.  
Thus, HRS § 706 -624 first requires a determination of 
whether a special (discretionary) condi tion of probation is 
reasonably related to the factors set forth in HRS § 706 -606.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 21  With respect to special condition Q, Talo was convicted of a 
felony under Hawaiʻi law, assault in the second degree.  He was 
also convicted of a “crime of violence” under Hawaiʻi law.13  As 
such, Talo is prohibited from owning, possessing, or controlling 
any firearm or ammunition pursuant to HRS § 134 -7(b).   
Hence, special condition Q was reasonably related to 
deterring Talo from committing an HRS § 134 -7(b) firearm and/or 
ammunition possession crime.  It was also reasonably related to 
protecting the public from further crimes by Talo involving 
firearms.  Thus, at a minimum, special condition Q is reasonably 
related to factors (2)(b) and (c) of HRS § 706 -606.   
HRS § 706 -624(2) further requires that special conditions 
involve deprivations of liberty only as reasonably necessary for 
section 706 -606(2) purposes.  Due to the heightened danger of 
firearm use,14 special condition Q involves a deprivation of 
 
13  HRS § 134 -1 (2016) defines  “crime of violence” as “any offense, as 
defined in title 37, that involves injury or threat of injury to the person 
of another, including sexual assault in the fourth degree under section 707 -
733 and harassment by stalking under section 711 -1106.5.”

the nation and only fifty total firearm deaths.  Firearm Mortality by State , 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , https://perma.cc/92XH -PMRD.  
While Hawaiʻi ranks the lowest nationally in gun ownership and has some of the 
strictest fir earm laws, the number of firearms in Hawaiʻi is increasing.  Gun 
Violence and Violent Crimes Commission (“GVVCC”), Report of the GVVCC  6 
(2022).  From 2000 to 2020, the number of permit applications processed 
increased by 302.5 percent.  Id.  Additionally,  between 2010 and 2019, Hawaiʻi 
saw a 38 percent increase in gun deaths.  Jolanie Martinez, Criminologists

(May 27, 2022), https://perma.cc/U6XP -RGX2.   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 22  liberty only as reasona bly necessary for the section 706 -606(2) 
purposes discussed above.  
Finally, Kahawai also requires a factual basis in the 
record for imposing a discretionary condition of probation.15  
103 Hawaiʻi at 466, 83 P.3d at 729.  Although Talo did not use a 
firearm in the commission of the underlying assault, the record 
supports the imposition of special condition Q because Talo was 
convicted of a felony offense as well as a crime of violence, 
which prohibited him from owning or possessing any firearms or 
ammunitio n. 
2. Under the circumstances, special condition Q’s   
  prohibition on possession of “contraband” gave Talo  
  appropriate notice that he was prohibited from owning  
  or possess ing firearms or ammunition  
 
As discussed earlier, HRS § 706 -624(3) requires that a 
written statement of probation conditions be provided to a 
defendant:  
(3)  Written statement of conditions.   The court shall 
order the defendant at the time of sentencing to sign a 
written acknowledgment of receipt of conditions of 
probatio n.  The defendant shall be given a written copy of 
any requirements imposed pursuant to this section, stated 
with sufficient specificity to enable the defendant to 
comply with the conditions accordingly.  
 
 
15  The sentencing transcript is not part of the record , so it is possible 
that testimony at the sentencing hearing created a record indicating that 
special condition Q was  necessary .  Regardless, we conclude special condition 
Q was properly imposed  based on the record.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 23  The ICA explained in Lee that this written notice r equirement is 
intended to provide defendant s with notice of what is expected .  
Lee, 10 Haw. App. at 198, 862 P.2d  at 298.  
Special condition Q allows for warrantless searches by a 
probation officer based on reasonable suspicion that “illicit 
substances(s) or other contraband , may be in the places(s)  of a 
search.” (emphasis added ).  If, as required by Kahawai, a 
sufficient fact ual basis appears in the record to impose  
special conditions regarding drugs, a person on probation would 
most likely have notice that a warrantless search condition for 
“illicit substances” could allow for drug searches.16  
The meaning of “ contraband ,” however, is not clear. 
“Contraband” could include firearms, child pornography, illegal 
fireworks, military equipment, or even endangered animals kept 
as pets, just to name a few examples.17  Hence, s pecial condition 
 
16  The term “illicit substances” is understood to refer to addictive and 
illegal substances such as heroin  and meth.  Illicit Drug Addiction and 
Abuse, Addiction Center, https://perma.cc/CR8E -ARMF.   
 
17  Black’s Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019) defines “contraband” as follows:  
 
1. “Illegal or prohibited trade; smuggling”;  
2. “Goods that are unlawful to import, export, produce, or possess.”  
 contraband , adj.   
- absolute contraband. (1908) Goods used primarily for war, such as 
 arms and ammunition, as well as clothing and equipment of a military 
 character.  
- conditional co ntraband.   (1915)  Goods susceptible of being used for 
 warlike and peaceful purposes, such as coal and food.  
- contraband per se . (1901)  Property whose possession is unlawful 
 regardless of how it is used.  
- derivative contraband.  (1965) Property whose p ossession becomes 
 unlawful when it is used in committing an illegal act.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 24 Q does not provide sufficient notice to a person on probation as 
to what “contraband” the person is prohibited from possessing so 
as to “enable the [person] to comply with the conditions 
accordingly. ”  HRS § 706 -624(3).  In addition, for “contraband” 
that has nothing to do with the rec ord, special condition Q 
would violate Kahawai. 18   
In Talo’s case, however, his written probation conditions 
contained a clear warning that he was “prohibited from owning or 
possessing any firearm or ammunition pursuant to HRS § 134 -7.” 
Special condition  B also clearly prohibited him from  owning or 
possessing any firearms or ammunition.19  Therefore, special 
condition Q sufficiently provided Talo with notice that 
“contraband” included firearms or ammunition.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
18  We disagree with the dissent that a probation condition prohibiting 
possession of all “contraband” is consistent with the Hawaiʻi cases we have 
discussed.  
 
19  YOU SHALL:  
  . . . . 
 B. Not own or possess any firearms or ammunition.  If you have any  
firearms or ammunition, you must immediately turn them in to the 
appropriate county police department[.]  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 25 V. Conclusion  
 
 Because Talo’s points on certiorari lack merit and t he 
circuit court did not abuse its discretion in imposing special 
condition Q , we affirm the ICA’s June 30, 2022 judgment on 
appeal.
