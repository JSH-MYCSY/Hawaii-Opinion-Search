OPINION OF THE COURT BY EDDINS, J.  
 
I. 
This case is about whether Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§ 706-671 (2014) ever entitles a defendant to “double count” 
concurrently-earned detention or incarceration credit against 
later-imposed consecutive sentences. Electronically Filed

 We hold that under HRS § 706-671(1) presentence detention 
time must be counted only 
once against the aggregate of a 
defendant’s consecutive sentences.  This is true even if those 
consecutive sentences are spread across multiple cases. 
Likewise, we hold that under HRS § 706-671(2) time served 
against concurrently running probation sentences that are later 
revoked and converted to consecutive terms of imprisonment must 
be counted only once against the aggregate of a defendant’s consecutive sentences in one or more cases. 
We also hold that when detention or prison time is accrued 
before sentencing, or pursuant to a later-revoked probationary 
sentence, the double jeopardy clause’s prohibition on multiple 
punishments is not violated so long as the defendant’s total 
period of detention and imprisonment does not exceed the 
statutory maximum term for the offenses at issue.  
II. 
   In 2018, the State charged Jonathan Vaden with drug and property crimes.  There were five unrelated cases, including the 
one at issue here, Case No. 2CPC-18-0000844 (2CPC-18-844 or this 
case). 
 In May 2019, after spending several months in jail for all 
five cases, Vaden pled no contest to all but one charge

drug in the first degree) in 2CPC- 18-0000844.

 court accepted Vaden’s pleas.  The parties waived a presentence 
report.   The court sentenced Vaden to four years of probation in
each case.  All terms ran concurrently.  And in all five cases, the court sentenced Vaden to terms of imprisonment as 
discretionary conditions of probation.  Vaden got six months 
(for the misdemeanors) and twelve and eighteen months (for the 
felonies). 2  
In June 2019, Vaden petitioned for admission into the Maui 
Drug Court Program.  The Maui Drug Court approved the petition.  It “re-sentenced” him to new probation terms, with the 
discretionary condition that he complete the drug court program.  
The court ordered that all previous probation terms and 
conditions that were “not inconsistent” with the new probation 
terms remain as probation conditions. 
A month later, in July 2019, Vaden was released from 
custody.  Vaden remained in the drug court program for a full 
five months before he violated its rules.  
Vaden was detained 
 
2  The presentence report (P SR) has “many uses in the criminal justice 
process.”  See State v. Carlton, 146 Hawaiʻ i 16, 27, 455 P.3d 356, 367 (2019).   
It affords victims, or their f amilies, an opportunity to be heard.  See HRS 
§ 706-604(3) (Supp. 2016).   It is used by the Hawai ʻi Paroling Authority in 
determining defendants

In some instances — for example where there is a recent pre- existing PSR – 
waiver of the PSR may be appropriate.  But these reports play an important 
role in our criminal justice system and trial courts should not consent to 
their waiver as a matter of course.  See HRS § 706-601(3) ( Supp. 2016) (“With 
the consent of the court, the requirement of a pre- sentence diagnosis may be 
waived by agreement of both the defendant and the prosecuting attorney.”).  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 again in December 2019.  The circuit court terminated him from 
the Maui Drug Court Program and revoked his probation.  
In February 2020, the circuit court resentenced Vaden as 
follows.

2CPC-18-0000315 Ct. 1-11  5 years in each count  
Ct. 12,13  1 year in each count

Ct. 5 1 year  
 
The court ordered the sentences in the first four cases to 
run concurrently with each other; the aggregate term was 5 years (the 5-year sentence).  The court also ran the sentences in 
2CPC-18-844 (this case) concurrently with each other; the 
aggregate term was 10 years (the 10-year sentence).  The court ran Vaden’s 10-year sentence consecutively to his 5-year 
sentence.  
The Resentencing Order stated: “Credit given for time 
served.” 
The Department of Public Safety (DPS) did not give the 
court the required certificates of detention detailing the days
Vaden was detained prior to sentencing and in connection with  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
5 
 his probation sentence.   But it credited him 340 days against 
the 5-year sentence and one day against the 10-year sentence. 3
Vaden moved the court to correct the credit he received: he 
wanted 340 days of credit against both the 5-year sentence and 
the 10-year sentence.  (DPS explained in an email to defense 
counsel that it declined to credit the 340 days against the 10-
year sentence in order to avoid “double dipping”; Vaden 
submitted the email to the court.)  Vaden invoked HRS § 706-671(1) and (2), as well as the double jeopardy clause.   
The court denied Vaden’s motion.  It relied on State v. 
  
court had sentenced Tauiliili to two concurrent 10-year terms and one consecutive 5-year term within a single case; we held 
that under HRS § 706-671(1), “presentence” credit should be 195, 29 P.3d 914 (2001).  There, the trial Tauiliili, 96 Hawai
ʻi  
 
3  HRS § 706-671(1) requires that when a defendant has previously been 
detained, the officer who has custody of the defendant furnish the court with 
a certificate showing how long the defendant spent in detention before 
sentencing.  HRS § 706-671(2) similarly requires that when a defendant who 
has been detained or imprisoned pursuant to an earlier sentence is re-
sentenced, “[t]he officer having custody of the defendant” shall furnish a 
certificate to the court at sentencing showing “the period of imprisonment 
served under the original sentence.”  Both subsections also instruct that the 
certificate be annexed to the “official records” of the defendant’s 
commitment.   
 
Here, the record contains no certificates of detention; Vaden was 
resentenced by the circuit court, but the court was not furnished with any certificates of detention by the Department of Public Safety .
  And there are 
no certificates of detention attached to the court’s judgment.  The absence of a detention certificate is particularly problematic here because it 
appears that the DPS’s informal credit calculations may have been wrong to 
the extent they gave Vaden only 472 days’ credit for time served in 2CPC- 18-
0000315 when it appears that he was actually imprisoned for 532 days in that case. 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 applied only once to the 
aggregate of consecutive sentences.  
Id. at 197, 199, 29 P.3d at 916, 918.  Citing Tauiliili, the 
circuit court ruled that Vaden could not get a “double credit”
for his 340 days of imprisonment before the resentencing.   
The ICA affirmed.  It observed that Vaden’s claim 
implicated two different credit categories: “presentence” credit 
under HRS § 706-671(1) and “probation incarceration” credit 
under HRS § 706-671(2).  But, the ICA noted, neither Vaden nor the State addressed this distinction.  So the record was unclear 
as to “what portion of the 340 days constitutes presentence days 
and probation sentence days.”  The distinction between 
presentence detention and probation incarceration played no 
further role in the ICA’s analysis; the ICA concluded that 
Tauiliili was “dispositive”: Vaden could not get “double” credit 
for any of the 340 days. 
Now, Vaden asks this court to consider whether the ICA 
gravely erred and violated his rights under HRS § 706-671 or the 
double jeopardy clause by “erasing” his incarceration credit and 
effectively adding 340 days to his 10-year sentence. 
III. 
A. Vaden’s incarceration credit implicates both HRS § 706-
671(1) and (2) 
 
Under HRS § 706-671(1) and (2), convicted defendants are 
entitled to credit for time served as follows:   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
7 
 (1)  When a defendant who is sentenced to imprisonment has 
previously been detained in any State or local correctional 
or other institution following the defendant’ s arrest for 
the crime for which sentence is imposed, such period of detention following the defendant’ s arrest shall be 
deducted from the minimum and maximum terms of such sentence. . . . 
(2)  When a judgment of conviction or a sentence is 
vacated and a new sentence is thereafter imposed upon the 
defendant for the same crime, the period of detention and imprisonment theretofore served shall be deducted from the 
minimum and maximum terms of the new sentence. . . . 
 These two subsections concern distinct types of credit.   
HRS § 706-671(1) controls credit for detention time between 
arrest and the initial sentence. 
HRS § 706-671(2), in contrast, deals with credit for time 
served as part of a sentence.   Though HRS § 706-671(2) refers to 
time served under a “vacated” sentence, our holding in State v. 
Delima confirms that HRS § 706-671(2) also applies to situations 
like Vaden’s where a defendant serves time pursuant to probation 
that is later revoked.  See 78 Hawai
ʻi 343, 348, 893 P.2d 194, 
199 (1995) (holding that six months imprisonment served by a 
defendant as a condition of a later-revoked, probation was “time 
spent imprisoned for the purposes of HRS § 706-671(2)” that must 
be deducted from the new sentence imposed on resentencing). 4
The 340 days at issue here consist of three distinct time 
 
4  The Model Penal Code and Commentaries’ (MPC) discussion of a parallel 
section – MPC § 7.09 – also makes clear that subsection (1) applies to “time 
served prior to sentencing” while subsection (2) addresses “time served under 
a conviction[.]”  MPC § 7.09 at 310 (emphasis added).  Though MPC § 7.09 uses 
the word “conviction” in subsection (2), the commentary confirms that its principle “also extend[s] to a situation in which a court vacates a sentence 
and imposes a new one without vacating the conviction.”  I d. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
8 periods:  
(1)
time served from his initial arrest to the initial
sentencing;
(2) time served under probation; and(3) time served between his (re)arrest in connection with
his termination from the Maui Drug Court Program andresentencing.
Category (1) is “presentence” time under HRS § 706-671(1). 
Under Delima, category (2) corresponds to “probation 
incarceration” time under HRS § 706-671(2).   
Regarding category (3), though it happened after the 
imposition of the initial sentences, it is comparable to “presentence” detention time since Vaden was not serving any 
“sentence” during that period.  Because HRS § 706-671(2) only 
governs time served under vacated or revoked sentences, we treat 
category (3) as “presentence” time under HRS § 706-671(1). B. Under HRS § 706-671(1) Vaden is entitled to credit his
presentence detention time once against the aggregate of 
his consecutive sentence terms
In Tauiliili, we held that under HRS § 706-671(1), “when
consecutive sentences are imposed, credit for presentence 
imprisonment is properly granted against only the aggregate of 
  at 199, 29 P.3d at the consecutive sentence terms.”  96 Hawaiʻi  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
9 918.
interpreted laws concerning defendants’ entitlement to “credit”
for presentence detention time as allowing for credit once 
against the aggregate of consecutive sentences.  See, e.g, 
Wilson v. State, 264 N.W.2d 234, 235 (Wis. 1978) (concluding 
that “where consecutive sentences are imposed, pretrial 
incarceration time should be credited as time served on only 
one of such sentences”).This holding is consistent with other courts that have
6 5
 
Vaden’s argument that Tauiliili is inapplicable because it 
concerns consecutive sentences within a single case as opposed 
to multiple cases lacks merit.  Vaden cites no authority 
allowing “double dipping” in the “presentence” credit context 
5In Tauiliili we noted that the commentary to HRS § 706-671 states that 
the statute “ provides for some equalization . . . between those defendants 
who obtain pre- sentence release and those who do not.”  Allowing those who 
are detained prior to sentencing to get repeat credit, we said, would 
undermine the legislature’s equalization rationale.  96 Hawai ʻi at 199, 29 
P.3d at 918.
6See also State v. Price , 50 P.3d 530, 535 (Mont. 2002) (holding that 
Montana statute governing credit for incarceration prior to conviction 
“entitles defendants to credit for presentence incarceration only once 
against the aggregate of all terms imposed when multiple sentences are 
imposed consecutively”); Schubert v. People, 698 P.2d 788, 795 (Colo. 1985) 
(“When consecutive sentences are imposed, crediting the period of presentence 
confinement against one of the sentences will assure the defendant full 
credit against the total term of imprisonment.”); Cox v. State, 522 P.2d 173, 
176 (Kan. 1974) (h olding that defendant was not entitled to credit 
presentence detention time against his state sentence where he had already 
received credit for that time against federal sentence he was serving 
consecutively to his state sentence); Nissel v. Pearce, 764 P.2d 224, 228 
(Or. 1988) (“In light of the underlying purposes of statutes giving credit 
for presentence time served and the absence of any indication that the 
legislature intended (or even contemplated) duplicate credit for consecutive 
sentences, we hold that the plaintiff was not entitled to receive credit on 
each of his consecutive sentences.”). *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
10 where the sentences at issue run consecutively to those in
unrelated cases.,87 
 
Tauiliili remains good law and is dispositive of our 
analysis of Vaden’s arguments to the extent they concern 
presentence credit time: under Tauiliili, Vaden is entitled to 
credit his presentence HRS § 706-671(1) time once against the 
aggregate of any later imposed consecutive sentences. 
C. Under HRS § 706-671(2) Vaden is entitled to credit for time
served as a condition of probation once against the 
aggregate of his consecutive sentences
Vaden also argues that HRS § 706-671(2) entitles him to
credit time served as a discretionary condition of probation against each of the consecutive sentences imposed following the 
revocation of that probation.  We disagree for three reasons. 
First, nothing in the plain text of HRS § 706-671(2) 
suggests that the legislature intended that time earned under 
HRS § 706-671(2) should be credited against multiple consecutive
sentences.  The statute’s use of the singular “sentence” reflects the fact that the word may refer not only to a  
7At least one state court of appeals has held that such “double dipping” 
is not allowed.  See Ransone v. State, 20 So.3d 445, 447, 449 (Fla. Dist. Ct. 
App. 2009) (refusing to double credit presentence jail time against 
consecutive sentences in two separate cases when the defendant was held in 
custody for both). 
8Vaden correctly argued that transferring credit to an unrelated case is 
prohibited.   See State v. March, 94 
Hawaiʻi 250, 255, 11 P.3d 1094, 1099 
(2000) (holding that a sentence that credits Defendant with the time served 
for an unrelated offense is illegal).  But no such transfer happened here.  The 340 days were simultaneously accrued in all five cases. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
11 particular term of incarceration imposed for a conviction on a 
single criminal count, but also to the sum of the terms of 
incarceration and other penalties imposed on a defendant for 
their crimes.  Multiple consecutive sentences are really just 
one sentence.  The order of resentencing in Vaden’s case 
describes the ten terms of incarceration (imposed for ten 
different counts across five different cases) as a single 
“sentence” imposed “with this order.”  Cf. State v. Percy, 612 A.2d 1119, 1127 (Vt. 1992) (“When all is said and done, a number
of consecutive sentences becomes one sentence, and it is against
this sentence, as ‘imposed,’ that pretrial detention is
credited.”).
Second, though Tauiliili does not control our analysis, its 
implicit interpretation of the word “sentence” in HRS § 706-
671(1) is persuasive.  Tauiliili treats HRS § 706-671(1)’s 
“sentence” as referring to the aggregate of consecutive 
sentences imposed in connection with the defendant’s crimes, not 
a particular term of imprisonment imposed in connection with a 
specific crime.  It makes sense to use the same definition of 
“sentence” in HRS § 706-671(2).  Adopting a more atomistic 
approach and reading “the new sentence” in HRS § 706-671(2) as 
referring to each consecutive term of incarceration imposed 
following the revocation or vacatur of probation would 
effectively require holding that the word “sentence” as used in *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
12 
 HRS § 706-671(2) has a different meaning from that of the same 
word in HRS § 706-671(1). 
Third, reading HRS § 706-671(2) as requiring that probation 
incarceration time be applied against each
 consecutive sentence 
imposed after the revocation of probation would lead to unfair and arbitrary results.  The defendant who served a year of 
probation incarceration time and then, following probation 
revocation, was sentenced to two consecutive five-year terms would, in total, spend a year less in prison than a defendant 
who served the same year as a condition of probation but was 
sentenced to a single ten-year term.  Cf. Tauiliili, 96 Hawaiʻ i
 
at 199, 29 P.3d at 918 (explaining that allowing repeat credit 
for presentence detention time against consecutive sentences 
would “defeat the legislative purpose underlying consecutive 
sentencing” since if multiple credit were allowed, “the more 
consecutive sentences a criminal defendant received, the more 
credit [they] would accrue for presentence imprisonment”). 
Further, this reading of HRS § 706-671(2) would curb 
courts’ ability to impose consecutive sentences.  For instance, if a defendant commits five misdemeanors in five separate cases 
and serves one year before sentencing, they would receive five 
years of credit if the court imposes consecutive statutory 
maximum terms (one year for each misdemeanor).  In that 
situation, the defendant would ultimately serve no additional *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
13 
 jail time, and the court’s decision to impose consecutive 
sentences would be pointless.  Id.  Indeed, any consecutive 
sentence would be meaningless. 
For these reasons, we hold that HRS § 706-671(2) entitles 
Vaden to incarceration credit earned pursuant to a later-revoked 
probationary sentence once against the aggregate of his later-
imposed consecutive sentences.  As in the HRS § 706-671(1) 
context, this holding applies irrespective of whether the sentences are in one case or spread across multiple cases. 
D. The double jeopardy clause does not require that Vaden be 
awarded incarceration credit against each of his 
consecutive sentences 
 
Along with his statutory arguments, Vaden advances a 
constitutional claim: he says the court’s refusal to deduct 340 
days from his 10-year consec sentence violates his double 
jeopardy rights.  We disagree. 
The constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy
9 
“protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.”  North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 717 (1969).  This 
guarantee “absolutely requires that punishment already exacted 
must be fully ‘credited’ in imposing sentence upon a new 
conviction for the same offense.”  Id. at 718-19 (emphases 
 
9  See U.S. Const. a mend. V (guaranteeing that a person “subject for the 
same offence” shall not be “twice put in jeopardy of life or limb”); Haw. 
Const. art I, § 10 (same except that article I, section 10 omits “life or 
limb”).  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
14 
 added) (footnote omitted). 
If Vaden’s incarceration time was earned pursuant to a 
probationary sentence that was later vacated, a trial court’s 
refusal to credit that time against a sentence imposed in 
connection with a “new conviction for the same offense” would 
implicate Vaden’s double jeopardy clause rights.10  But that’s 
not what happened here.  Vaden’s 340 days were served either before sentencing
11 or pursuant to a sentence of probation that 
was later revoked, not vacated.12  So his double jeopardy rights 
would only come into play if his total punishment in this case 
 
10  See State v. Thompson, No. SCWC- 17-0000427, 2020 WL 2846618, *3 (Haw. 
June 1, 2020) (SDO) (acknowledging that applying time served on vacated 
sentences only once against the aggregate of new consecutive sentences for 
the same crimes “would raise very serious double jeopardy issues” and result 
in “unconstitutional ‘multiple punishments’ for the same offense.”  (C itation 
omitted)). 
11  Several courts have held that the denial of prison credit for 
presentence detention time generally does not raise constitutional issues 
unless it operates to extend the defendant’s total incarceration beyond the 
statutory maximum term.  See, e.g., Faye v. Gray, 541 F.2d 665, 667 (7th Cir. 
1976); State v. Warde, 570 P.2d 766, 768– 69 (Ariz. 1977) (“[A] number of 
state and federal appellate courts . . . have held that a defendant, as a 
matter of equal protection, must be credited with presentence jail time when 
such time, if added to the maximum sentence imposed, will exceed the maximum 
statutory sentence.” (Emphasis added.)).  
12  “[T]he imposition of confinement when an offender violates his term 
of probation has never been considered to raise a serious double jeopardy 
problem.”  Ralston v. Robinson, 454 U.S. 201, 220 n.14 (1981).  This is 
because the revocation of a defendant’s probation and the imposition of a new 
sentence is a modification of the defendant’s original sentence, not a “second” or “multiple” punishment for d ouble jeopardy purposes.  So, as the 
Supreme Court explained in Ralston, there is no “double jeopardy” problem 
when the offender “by his own actions, trigger[s] the condition that permits 
appropriate modification of the terms of confinement.”  Id.  Cf. United 
States v. DiFrancesco, 449 U.S. 117, 137 (1980) (stating that the double 
jeopardy c lause “does not provide the defendant with the right to know at any 
specific moment in time what the exact limit of his punishment will turn out 
to be” and observing that “there is no double jeopardy protection against 
revocation of probation and the imposition of imprisonment”). *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
15 
 exceeded the maximum statutory penalty for the crimes at issue.
Cf. Jones v. Thomas, 491 U.S. 376, 381 (1989) (“[I]n the 
multiple punishments context, [the interest that the double 
jeopardy clause seeks to protect] is ‘limited to ensuring that 
the total punishment did not exceed that authorized by the 
legislature.’”).  The sum of Vaden’s 10-year sentence and the 
340 days of presentence and probation incarceration  at issue in
this case is just shy of 11 years, far below the 21 years of 
incarceration Vaden could have received in this case if the 
court ran his terms of imprisonment consecutively.151413  
 
  
Since Vaden’s punishment in this case does not exceed the 
 
13  In Faye, the Seventh Circuit explained that in the context of 
presentence incarceration, unconstitutional “double punishment” happens only 
“when the [uncredited] pre- sentence time together with the sentence imposed 
is greater than the statutory maximum penalty for the offense.”  541 F.2d at 
667.  It stands to reason that the d ouble jeopardy clause would also prohibit 
a court from imposing terms of imprisonment following the revocation of 
probation that, if combined with time already served pursuant to the 
probation, would exceed the maximum statutory total punishment for the crimes 
at issue in the case. 
14  The record is unclear as to how many of the 340 days were accrued 
before sentencing and how many were accrued in connection with Vaden’s 
probation sentence.  
15  The Faye court viewed “the statutory maximum penalty” as the maximum 
consecutive terms a court can impose for the offenses at issue.  541 F.2d at 
666-67.  There, the court sentenced the defendant to two concurrent seven-
year terms for two counts of rape; the statutory maximum for each was 30 years.  Id. at 666.  Because the presentence time plus the two concurrent 
sentences was less than “the maximum punishment of 60 years which he could 
have received [if the trial court ran the two 30- year terms consecutively],” 
the court concluded that uncredited presentence time did not violate the 
guarantee against double jeopardy.  Id. at 667.  Here, the maximum 
consecutive terms the court could have imposed for the offenses at issue is 21 years: ten years for Count 2, five years each for Counts 3 and 4, and one 
year for Count 5. 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
16 
 statutory maximum total punishment for the crimes at issue, and 
since his probation incarceration credit was not accrued under a 
vacated sentence, the trial court did not violate Vaden’s double 
jeopardy clause rights by declining to credit the 340 days 
against Vaden’s 10-year sentence. 
IV. 
As described above, we affirm the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal.  
We remand this case to the circuit court so that the court may: 
(1) order the Department of Public Safety to furnish the court 
with certificates of detention that comply with HRS § 706-671(1) 
and (2); and (2) file an amended judgment that affixes those 
certificates of detention.   Benjamin E. Lowenthal
