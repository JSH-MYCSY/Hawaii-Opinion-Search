OPINION OF THE COURT BY EDDINS, J. 
 
A minor stabbed another minor.  The State prosecuted, and 
the minor, DM, argued self-defense.  The family court rejected 
his defense.  It ruled the prosecution had proven attempted 
assault in the first degree beyond a reasonable doubt.  
In Hawaiʻ i self-defense cases, the defendant’s subjective 
belief drives an objective reasonableness standard.  Factfinders

 reality.  Then, from that perspective, the judge or jury 
evaluates the objective reasonableness of the defendant’s 
subjective belief that self-protective force was necessary.   
Here the family court inadequately assessed the 
circumstances from DM’s perspective.  The court also misapplied 
key self-defense elements: the use of deadly force and the duty 
to retreat. 
Substantial evidence does not support DM’s adjudication.  
We reverse.  
I. 
 
The State filed a petition that alleged DM violated 
Hawaiʻi 
Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 705-500 and 707-710, attempted assault 
in the first degree.1  After a bench trial, the family court 
adjudicated DM as charged.  
DM contests the elemental facts.  The factual circumstances 
are mostly undisputed. 
After midnight in June 2019, a large group of ‘ Ewa Beach 
teenagers socialized at One
‘ula Beach Park (Hau Bush) in ‘ Ewa 
Beach.  Most drank alcohol.  The interior lights from open car 
and truck doors lit up the pitch-black area. 
 
1 A person commits attempted assault in the first degree if the person 
“intentionally engages in conduct which, under the circumstances as the 
person believes them to be, constitutes a substantial step in a course of 
conduct intended to culminate in the person’s commission” of assault in the 
first degree, which is committed if the person “intentionally or knowingly 
causes serious bodily injury to another person.”  HRS §§ 705-500 (2014), 707-
710 (2014).  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 DM and his cousin heard about the gathering on social 
media.  The cousin drove to Hau Bush.  DM did not know anyone 
there.  Soon DM met some girls.  As they talked, a shirtless 
teen (CW) obtruded.  CW appeared “sketchy,” so DM suggested he 
leave.  CW left.  
But soon CW returned.  He harassed a girl who was talking 
with DM.  CW called her “bitch” and “slut.”  DM stood up for 
her.  Then CW challenged DM to fight.  DM said he didn’t want any problems and asked CW to leave.  CW did not leave this time.  
CW asked DM where he was from.  DM replied, Kalihi, and the two 
teens argued. 
Then, things got physical.  CW rushed DM.  He punched DM 
several times.  DM fought back.  CW’s friends and others jumped 
in, pulled CW off DM, and pushed DM away.  CW’s friends 
restrained and tried to reason with him.  But CW didn’t listen; 
he broke from his friends’ grasp.  
Again, CW rushed and punched DM.  He tackled DM to the 
ground.  As before, DM fought back.  The two wrestled and punched each other.  Other teens entered the fray.  One of CW’s 
friends said he “grabbed” DM and “walked away with him.”  CW’s 
friends pulled him off and away from DM.  They held CW and tried 
to settle him down.  For unknown reasons, other fights broke 
out.  Hau Bush had turned “chaotic” and “rowdy.” *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
4 
 The crowd closed in.  DM did not see his cousin.  To DM, 
“the whole ‘ Ewa Beach” was there.  DM darted to his cousin’s car.  
He got his work knife and faced the crowd, a few feet from the 
car.  Only about ten to fifteen seconds had gone by since he had 
been attacked.  Holding his knife, DM warned: “Who like get 
stab?” 
The crowd stopped or backed off, except CW.  Despite his 
friends’ grip, he broke free, yet again.  He launched into the 
air, tackling DM.  DM never moved from his spot, next to the 
car. 
CW landed atop DM.  He unleashed a flurry of punches.  DM 
held his arms over his face.  Soon CW rolled off DM.  DM had stabbed CW, once, in the abdomen.  DM got up.  He found his 
cousin and told him he had “accidentally” stabbed someone.  The 
cousin quickly drove them away.
  
 DM testified.  He detailed the verbal and physical confrontations with CW.  He described how CW rushed him the 
second time.  They fought on the ground.  Another teen punched 
DM in the head.  DM described this attack as being “side-blinded from somebody else.”  Then DM recounted, another person hit him: 
he “got punch[ed] again.  And I was looking.  I was tripping out 
. . . [c]hoke people was getting nuts.”  DM was scared.  “Like 
had a lot of people.  I was getting whack.  I was outnumbered.” *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
5 
 DM dashed to his cousin’s car and grabbed his work knife; 
it had a three to four-inch blade.  He hoped the crowd would 
back off.  DM stayed put, near his cousin’s car.  CW and other 
teens advanced: “[h]ad more boys coming to rush me.”  They were 
ten feet from him.  DM warned: “Who like get stab?”  DM did not 
want to hurt anybody.  Instead, he wanted to “make them back 
away.”  They slowed or backed away, but not CW. 
CW yelled “I no give a fuck if you have the knife” and 
propelled into the air, tackling DM.  DM tried to “catch” or “wrap” CW.  Then DM was on his back.  Astride DM, CW threw 
several punches before rolling off him.  DM had stabbed CW. 
DM argued he lacked intent and acted in self-defense. The family court adjudicated DM as a law violator.  The 
State had proven the elements of attempted assault in the first degree.   
The court rejected DM’s defense.  DM’s use of deadly force 
was not objectively reasonable.  DM could not stab CW “under the circumstances.”

2  Findings of Fact (FOF) #41 reads: 
 
41. While [DM] may have subjectively believed that such 
deadly force was necessary, the Court does not find that 
the amount of force used was objectively reasonable under 
the circumstances of this case, beginning and culminating with getting the knife from the vehicle, coming out of the 
vehicle instead of staying in the vehicle, making a 
threatening statement and ultimately resulting in [DM] 
stabbing [CW]. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
6 
 The court also found that DM’s use of deadly force 
comprised not just the stabbing, but also the steps leading up 
to it: “retrieving the weapon from the vehicle, coming out of 
the vehicle with the weapon, making the threatening statement 
and ultimately using the weapon does constitute deadly force.”3  
Further, the court found that DM “could have waited in the vehicle or left the area with complete safety.”
4 
DM appealed.  DM challenges the court’s self-defense-
related findings and conclusions.  And citing State v. Lubong, 
77 Hawaiʻ i 429, 433, 886 P.2d 766, 770 (App. 1994), DM argues the 
court did not properly assess the circumstances from his 
“shoes.”   
 
3  FOF #42 reads: 
 
42. The mere brandishing and/or threat to cause death or 
serious bodily injury by the production of a weapon so long 
as the actor’ s intent is limited to creating an 
apprehension does not in and of itself constitute deadly 
force.  However, retrieving the weapon from the vehicle, coming out of the vehicle with the weapon, making the 
threatening statement and ultimately using the weapon does 
constitute deadly force. 
 
4  FOF #37 reads: 
 
37. [DM] could have gone to the vehicle and instead of 
getting the knife, could have extricated himself from the 
situation if he stayed in the vehicle or he could have left 
the area but chose not to do so. 
 
Conclusions of Law (COL) #12 reads, in part: 
 
12. [DM] left the area to obtain a weapon, the knife, from 
a vehicle and returned and stated “who like get stabbed.” 
The confrontation was broken up, but [DM] chose to return 
with the weapon, ultimately stabbing [CW].  [DM] could have 
waited in the vehicle or left the area with complete 
safety. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 The State counters that the record supports the court’s 
ruling.  It argues the family court properly evaluated the 
evidence and rejected DM’s self-defense claim. 
The Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) affirmed the family 
court in a memorandum opinion with a dissent.  The ICA concluded 
the court did not err, and the State had presented sufficient 
evidence to establish that DM intended to stab CW without lawful 
justification.   
II. 
We conclude the family court wrongly rejected DM’s defense.   The court inadequately assessed DM’s conduct from his 
perspective.   
The family court also misapplied key self-defense elements.  
Because DM’s actions before he stabbed CW did not constitute deadly force, the court erred.  Next, the court misapplied the 
duty to retreat.  Third, there were not separate fights as the 
court found, but rather one violent event between DM and CW.  Lastly, the court overlooked evidence about DM defending himself 
against multiple attackers.  
A. 
The court temporally bumped up the analysis of two central 
self-defense elements: the use of deadly force and the duty to retreat.  The court’s approach, we believe, skewed its 
subjective and objective analysis. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
8 
   DM did not use deadly force before he stabbed CW.  Thus, 
the court erred in FOF #42 when it ruled that “retrieving the 
weapon from the vehicle, coming out of the vehicle with the 
weapon, making the threatening statement and ultimately using 
the weapon does constitute deadly force.”  True, “using the 
weapon” does constitute deadly force.  But DM’s other actions do 
not
 constitute deadly force. 
The use of deadly force, not actions before a person uses 
deadly force, constitutes deadly force.  Deadly force means “force which the actor uses with the intent of causing or which 
the actor knows to create a substantial risk of causing death or 
serious bodily harm.”  HRS § 703-300 (2014) (emphasis added).  
DM used deadly force at the moment he stabbed CW.  Not before.  
See State v. Pemberton, 71 Haw. 466, 477, 796 P.2d 80, 85 (1990) 
(focusing on the defendant’s perspective “at the time [they] tried to defend [themselves]” with deadly force). 
DM’s pre-stab conduct did not constitute deadly force for 
another reason.  CW attacked DM.  DM did not “provoke[] the use of force against him.”
5  So, under the circumstances, DM could 
 
5  No one claimed DM provoked the use of force against himself.  HRS 
§ 703-304(5)(a) (2014) reads: 
 
The use of deadly force is not justifiable under this 
section if: (a) The actor, with the intent of causing death or serious 
bodily injury, provoked the use of force against himself in 
the same encounter[.] *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
9 
 produce his knife and threaten the crowd without those actions 
constituting deadly force.  “A threat to cause death or serious 
bodily injury, by the production of a weapon or otherwise, so 
long as the actor’s intent is limited to creating an 
apprehension that the actor will use deadly force if necessary, 
does not constitute deadly force.”  HRS § 703-300.   
The evidence showed DM intended to create apprehension that 
if necessary, he would use deadly force.  CW and others had attacked DM and a crowd was “coming to rush” him.
  DM felt 
outnumbered.  He did not want to hurt anybody.  He just wanted to “make them back away.”  DM stayed in the same spot, near his 
cousin’s car.  And his words: “Who like get stab?” expressed an 
intent limited to creating an apprehension that he would use 
deadly force, if necessary. 
Contrary to the court’s finding, there was no deadly force 
when DM got his knife and cautioned the crowd.  
B. 
Turning to the duty to retreat, the court misapplied the 
law there, too.  
Hawaiʻi law does not require a person to retreat before 
using deadly force.  That is, unless the person “knows that 
[they] can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
10 
 safety by retreating.”  HRS § 703-304(5)(b) (emphases added).   
It’s a purely subjective inquiry. 6
The court gave no consideration to whether DM knew he could 
retreat with complete safety.  It felt DM should have or could 
have handled things differently; by, for instance, sitting in 
his cousin’s car, a move DM feels would have made him “a sitting 
duck.” 
There was no evidence to support the court’s recommended 
pathways to compete safety.  And there was no evidence presented (or considered by the court) regarding whether DM subjectively 
knew he could sit in the car or leave the unfamiliar, lightless 
area with complete safety.  See State v. Augustin, 101 
Hawaiʻi 
127, 128, 63 P.3d 1097, 1098 (2002) (explaining that a defendant 
only has knowledge of circumstances when the defendant is 
“aware” of the circumstances). 
The court discounted duty to retreat’s purely subjective 
nature.  The duty to retreat depends on the actor’s perspective.  
The factfinder considers what the defendant knows at the time.  
“The use of deadly force is not justifiable under this section if . . . [t]he actor knows that [they] can avoid the necessity 
of using such force with complete safety by retreating . . .” 
 
6 HRS § 703- 304(5) provides: “The use of deadly force is not justifiable 
under this section if . . . [t]he actor knows that [they] can avoid the 
necessity of using such force with complete safety by retreating . . . .” 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
11 
 HRS § 703-304(5) (emphasis added); State v. Mark, 123  
205, 226, 231 P.3d 478, 499 (2010) (applying the subjective 
inquiry to the duty to retreat: “[n]othing in this testimony indicates that Petitioner knew that he could avoid the necessity 
of using deadly force by retreating,” and “Petitioner did not 
testify as to any knowledge he may have had in regard to 
avoiding the necessity of using force.”).  Hawaiʻi
Also, the family court prematurely applied the duty to 
retreat analysis.  DM’s acts up until the stab did not 
constitute deadly force.  There was no deadly force used when DM 
grabbed the knife or when he produced it to scare the crowd.  DM 
didn’t have a duty to retreat at those times.7  The temporal 
context for the retreat analysis occurs at the moment deadly 
force is used or becomes imminent.  See Matter of Y.K., 663 
N.E.2d 313 (N.Y. 1996) (explaining the duty to retreat “d[oes] not arise until the point at which deadly physical force was 
used or imminent.”). 
Contrary to the court’s finding, the duty to retreat kicked 
in at the moment CW broke free from his friends and rushed DM.  Even if DM could have safely left before that time, he had no 
 
7  There is no duty to retreat when force is used.  But if a person uses 
deadly force, there is a duty to retreat.   To the extent the family court 
treated DM’s “threat” – “Who like get stab?” -   as “force” to boost its use 
of “deadly force” finding, it also erred.  “Force” means any “bodily 
impact . . . or the threat thereof.”  HRS § 703- 300. 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
12 
 legal duty to do so - he had not yet used deadly force.  HRS 
§§ 703-300, 703-304(5)(b).  Nothing in the record shows that - 
at the time CW attacked - DM knew he could retreat with complete 
safety without using deadly force. 
C. 
The family court failed to adequately assess and credit 
DM’s perspective in another key way.  The court split the event into separate fights.
8  But there were not separate fights 
between DM and CW.  Rather, there was one continuous violent 
event between DM and CW.  The court’s multiple-fights finding is 
clearly erroneous.  See In re Doe, 95 Hawaiʻ i 183, 190, 20 P.3d 
616, 623 (2001) (principle that a finding by the family court 
“is clearly erroneous when (1) the record lacks substantial 
evidence to support the finding, or (2) despite substantial 
 
8  The court’s multiple fights findings include COL #12 and FOF numbers 
23, 29, 38, 39: 
 
23. After the fight was broken up, it was at that point 
that [DM] went over to a vehicle, the Nissan Altima that 
his cousin had driven him to Hau Bush in.  [DM] retrieved a 
knife that he used for work.  Upon retrieving the knife, 
[DM] exited the vehicle, and yelled out “who like get stabbed.” 
 
29. After the second altercation, when [DM] extricated 
himself from the situation, [DM] went to the vehicle, 
obtained a knife from the vehicle, came back out of the vehicle with the knife, and stated “who like get stabbed.”  
At that point, [CW] charged at [DM].  
38. [DM] was entitled to utilize self- defense in the first 
altercation. 
 
39. When the second altercation occurred, [DM] was also 
entitled to use self- defense, but only such force that was 
reasonably necessary under the circumstances. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
13 
 evidence in support of the finding, the appellate court is 
nonetheless left with a definite and firm conviction that a 
mistake has been made.”). 
The court believed the fight between CW and DM mostly 
ended, restarted, then ended, before DM stabbed CW in yet 
another fight.  Fights, though, are unpredictable.  They often 
rapidly unfold and evolve.  Lulls happen.  Danger recedes and 
surges.  A fight’s end is sometimes murky.  Only about 10-15 seconds passed between DM rising from the 
ground and facing the crowd with his knife.  Before then, CW had 
escaped his friends’ hold and attacked DM.  Others also attacked 
him, DM believed.  And before that, CW attacked DM - after DM 
aided a girl who CW had vulgarly harassed.   
 To DM, there were no rounds, no multiple fights, just one 
continuous event.  The family court did not adequately consider 
DM’s perspective. 
D. 
The court disregarded DM’s perspective relating to another 
self-defense feature.  DM believed he faced peril from multiple 
attackers.  Since DM used deadly force, which the court deemed 
objectively unreasonable, this mattered.  See State v. DeLeon, 
143 Hawaiʻ i 208, 218, 426 P.3d 432, 442 (2018) (stating that a 
person who faces other attackers presents “an exception to the *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
14 
 general rule that a claim of self-defense fails when deadly 
force is used to stop a simple assault.”).   
DM believed that others besides CW had attacked him.  As he 
fought with CW, someone else punched him in the head.  Then, 
another person landed a punch.  DM was getting “whacked.” 9  This 
happened right before DM darted to his cousin’s nearby car.  
The family court ignored, or at least severely undervalued, 
DM’s experiences and point of view at the moment he used deadly 
force.  CW had attacked DM more than once.  Others also 
assaulted him.10  People were rowdy, going nuts in the pitch-
black area.  DM wasn’t from there.  He felt outnumbered.  DM 
thought the ‘ Ewa Beach crowd was about to rush him.   
The court failed to consider DM’s belief that deadly force 
was necessary to protect himself from serious physical harm by 
 
9  The family court did not find that DM’s testimony in this respect 
lacked veracity: 
 
36. [DM] claimed he was assaulted not only by [CW] but that 
somebody else had struck him, which then caused him to 
extricate himself from the situation and go to the vehicle. 
 
The court made one finding that DM’s testimony was not credible: 
 
27. [DM] testified that the stab was an accident, and that he was trying to hug and/or catch [CW].  The Court does not 
find that to be credible testimony.  The Court finds that 
[DM] did in fact stab, and did intend to stab the 
complaining witness with the knife that was produced. 
 
10 There was evidence to support DM’s fear from other attackers.  CW’s 
friend got physical with DM.  He testified that he “grabbed” DM and “walked 
away with him.” *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 more than one attacker.11  DeLeon, 143  at 218, 426 P.3d at
442. Hawaiʻi  
III. 
 
A subjective and objective inquiry guides Hawaiʻ i’s self-
defense law.  In self-D cases, the factfinder’s decision pivots 
on the objective reasonableness of the defendant’s subjective 
belief about the need to use force or deadly force.12  State v. 
Culkin, 97 Hawaiʻ i 206, 217, 35 P.3d 233, 244 (2001).  
 The family court concluded that DM “may have subjectively 
believed” deadly force was necessary.  Then the court skipped to 
the objective analysis: 
41. While [DM] may have subjectively believed that such 
deadly force was necessary, the Court does not find that 
the amount of force used was objectively reasonable under 
the circumstances of this case, beginning and culminating 
with getting the knife from the vehicle, coming out of the vehicle instead of staying in the vehicle, making a 
threatening statement and ultimately resulting in [DM] 
stabbing [CW].  
We conclude that the family court inadequately considered 
DM’s perspective.  It found that DM’s subjective belief was 
objectively unreasonable without appraising DM’s point of view.  
 
11  Defendants may use deadly force if they believe it is necessary to 
protect themselves against death or serious bodily injury.  HRS § 703- 304(2).  
“‘Serious bodily injury’ means: bodily injury which creates a substantial 
risk of death or which causes serious, permanent disfigurement, or protracted 
loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ.”  HRS 
§ 707-700 (2014 & Supp. 2019). 
 
12  This case involves deadly force.  DM concedes he used deadly force when 
he stabbed CW with a knife.  Deadly force means “force which the actor uses 
with the intent of causing or which the actor knows to create a substantial 
risk of causing death or serious bodily harm.”  HRS § 703- 300. 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
16 
 The court shortchanged DM’s perspective.  And this tilted its 
objective analysis.  
HRS § 703–304(2) describes the subjective part.  The use of 
deadly force in self-protection is justified “if the actor 
believes that deadly force is necessary to protect [themselves] 
against death, serious bodily injury, kidnapping, rape, or 
forcible sodomy.”13   
HRS § 703-300 brings the objective part.  It defines 
“believes” as “reasonably believes.”   
Once the type of force is determined, a two-step inquiry 
happens.  In deadly force cases, the factfinder first decides whether the defendant subjectively believed that deadly force 
was necessary.  Then, if so, the judge or jury decides whether 
that belief was objectively reasonable.  But how? 
The defendant’s perspective provides the evidentiary scope
for the objective analysis.  The defendant’s sensory and pre-
deadly force experiences control the factfinder’s objective evaluation.  See Pemberton, 71 Haw. at 477, 796 P.2d at 85  
 
13  Compare HRS § 703- 304(1) regarding the use of non- deadly force (“the 
use of force . . . is justifiable when the actor believes that such force is 
immediately necessary for the purpose of protecting [themselves] against the 
use of unlawful force by the other person on the present occasion”) (emphasis 
added) with HRS § 703- 304(2) regarding deadly force (“the use of deadly force 
is justifiable . . . if the actor believes that deadly force is necessary to 
protect [themselves] against death, serious bodily injury, [etc.]”) (emphasis added). 
 
Hawaiʻi 
Standard Jury Instructions, Criminal (HAWJIC) 7.01A misstates 
HRS § 703- 304(2)
.  For deadly force cases, it adds the adverb “immediately.”

 (principal that “the standard for judging the reasonableness of 
a defendant’s belief for the need to use deadly force is 
determined from the point of view of a reasonable person in the 
Defendant’s position under the circumstances as [they] believed 
them to be

protection, the evidence must be assessed from the standpoint of

at the time [they] tried to defend [themselves].”).   
 The court bypassed DM’s perspective of the event.  There 
were not separate, divisible fights, as the court believed.  And 
CW did not pose the only danger to DM.  Also, temporally, the 
court incorrectly advanced DM’s use of deadly force, as well as 
DM’s duty to retreat.  Further, the court overlooked DM’s 
subjective belief that he could not retreat with complete 
safety.  These analytical flaws, we conclude, improperly 
impacted the court’s objective analysis. 
A defendant’s circumstances - what they think, see, hear, 
touch, smell, and (sometimes even) taste - frame the objective inquiry.  Because the defendant’s subjective belief shapes the 
objective standard, the judge or jury wears the defendant’s 
headset and enters the defendant’s reality.  See Lubong, 77 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 Hawai
ʻi at 433, 886 P.2d at 770 (instructing that “[t]he 
factfinder is required to place itself in the shoes of the 
defendant, determine the point of view which the defendant had at the time of the incident, and view the conduct of the victim 
with all its pertinent sidelights as the defendant was warranted 
in viewing it.”) (Cleaned up.) 
We are unconvinced that the family court satisfactorily 
assessed DM’s perspective.  CW attacked DM, more than once.  
Someone else punched DM in the head.  And DM thought another 
teen also hit him.  The chaotic crowd in the unfamiliar, 
darkened area scared DM.  They were nuts.  DM believed the fight 
with CW had dangerously ripened.  He thought others endangered 
him; DM felt outnumbered.  “The whole ‘ Ewa Beach” was there. 
 DM got the knife to make the crowd withdraw.  Yet, after DM 
retrieved the knife, CW and others still advanced.  DM recalled: 
“had more boys coming to rush me.”  They were close, ten feet 
away.  DM stayed put.  Only seconds had passed since CW and 
others had struck him while he was on the ground.  DM warned: 
“Who like get stab?”  He didn’t want to hurt anybody, he said.  
DM just wanted to “make them back away.”  It didn’t work.  CW 
rushed, tackled, and punched DM.  DM stabbed him, once. 
We conclude that the family court inadequately assessed the 
circumstances from DM’s perspective.  The court’s slight treatment of DM’s subjective beliefs and the court’s errors *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 relating to the use of deadly force and the duty to retreat, 
marred the court’s objective analysis.  
Under the circumstances of this case, we find that there 
was not substantial evidence presented to support the family 
court’s conclusion that the State proved beyond a reasonable 
doubt that DM’s use of deadly force was unjustified.14

14  As we explained in State v. Martinez: 
 
We have long held that evidence adduced in the trial court 
must be considered in the strongest light for the 
prosecution when the appellate court passes on the legal 
sufficiency of such evidence to support a conviction; the 
same standard applies whether the case was before a judge 
or a jury.  The test on appeal is not whether guilt is 
established beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether there 
was substantial evidence to support the conclusion of the 
trier of fact.
