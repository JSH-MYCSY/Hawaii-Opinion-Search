SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., McKenna, Eddins, Ginoza, and Devens, JJ.)  
The underlying dispute in this case arises from events 
surrounding and subsequent to the non-judicial foreclosure and 
sale of Michael C. Greenspon’s Maui property in 2010. On  
 
   
 
 
  
 
  
  
   ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
December 10, 2014, Greenspon filed a complaint1 against First-
Citizens Bank & Trust Company (CIT), successor by merger to CIT 
Bank, N.A., f/k/a OneWest Bank N.A., f/k/a OneWest Bank N.A., 
FSB2 and its counsel David B. Rosen, Esq. and The Law Office of 
David B. Rosen (the Rosen Defendants) in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (circuit court).

On March 10, 2015, on a motion from CIT, the circuit 
court stayed proceedings in the instant case pending resolution 
of a related appeal before the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA). The circuit court’s written order provided: “[T]his case 
is STAYED pending a final resolution in that appeal currently 
pending before the [ICA]. Consequently, all pending hearings 
are hereby removed from the Court’s calendar, but may be re-
scheduled upon the entry of an Order lifting this Stay.” The 
ICA ruled in the related appeal in August 2016 and remanded 
those proceedings to the circuit court where that litigation resumed. 
1 Greenspon’s complaint alleged: negligent and intentional 
misrepresentation; violations of the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices 
Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1692; violations of Hawai‘ i collection practices under 
Hawai‘i Revised Statutes (HRS) chapter 480D; unfair and deceptive acts and 
practices under HRS chapter 480; negligence/recklessness; abuse of process; 
negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress; damages; and punitive and exemplary damages.

On October 30, 2018, more than two years after the 
resolution of the related appeal, the Rosen Defendants filed 
written notice that Greenspon had yet to file a pretrial 
statement in the instant case. On November 30, 2018, the 
circuit court dismissed Greenspon’s complaint for failure to 
comply with Rules of the Circuit Courts of the State of Hawai‘ i 
(RCCH) Rule 12(q) (eff. 2007).4 
On March 4, 2019, on a motion from Greenspon, the 
circuit court entered a written order setting aside its RCCH 
Rule 12(q) dismissal and extending the deadline for Greenspon to 
file his pretrial statement to July 1, 2019. Greenspon timely filed his pretrial statement but did not thereafter request a 
trial setting status conference or otherwise move the case 
forward. On April 17, 2020, CIT moved to dismiss the case with 
prejudice under Hawai‘ i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 41(b)(1) 
(eff. 2012).
5 Concurrently, CIT moved to designate Greenspon a 
vexatious litigant under Hawai‘ i Revised Statutes (HRS) chapter 
4 RCCH Rule 12(q), then- effective, provided in part: 
An action may be dismissed sua sponte with written notice 
to the parties if a pretrial statement has not been filed 
within 8 months after a complaint has been filed (or within 
any further period of extension granted by the court) or if 
a trial setting status conference has not been scheduled as 
required by Rule 12(c). 
RCCH Rule 12(q) (eff. 2007). 
5 HRCP Rule 41(b)(1) provides: “For failure . . . to prosecute or 
to comply with these rules or any order of the court, a defendant may move 
for dismissal of an action or of any claim against it.”

634J for bad faith conduct in this and related cases. The 
circuit court granted both motions and entered final judgment. 
On appeal, the ICA vacated the circuit court’s 
dismissal and final judgment, finding that the March 10, 2015 
stay order had never been lifted and thus pretrial deadlines had 
not run. The ICA held that all filings while the stay remained 
in place were improper, but did not expressly vacate the circuit 
court’s 634J order and later declined to clarify the effect of 
its decision on that order. 
On certiorari, Greenspon asks this court to expressly 
vacate the circuit court’s 634J order. Respondent-Petitioner CIT asks us to vacate the ICA’s judgment on appeal and affirm 
the circuit court’s dismissal, 634J order, and final judgment. 
Interpretation of a judgment, order or decree 
“presents a question of law” and is “reviewable de novo”. See
Herrmann v. Herrmann
, 138 Hawai‘i 144, 152, 378 P.3d 860, 868 
(2016); 
Bank of Haw. v. DeYoung
, 92 Hawai‘i 347, 351, 992 P.2d 
42, 46 (2000). Further, when interpreting a circuit court order on appeal, we have consistently held: 
“The general rule is that, like any other written 
instrument, a court order must ‘be construed reasonably and 
as a whole so as to give effect to the intention of the 
court.’” Wohlschlegel v. Uhlmann- Kihei, Inc., 4 Haw. App. 
123, 130, 662 P.2d 505, 511 ([ App.] 1983) (citing Smith v. 
Smith, 56 Haw. 295, 301, 535 P.2d 1109, 1114 (1975)). “‘Moreover, we must give effect not only to that which is 
expressed but also to that which is unavoidably and 
necessarily implied by the judgment or decree.’” Id.

(quoting Ahuna v. Dep’t of Hawaiian Home Lands, 64 Haw. 
327, 333– 34, 640 P.2d 1161, 1166 (1982)).  
State v. Nelson , 140 Hawai‘i 123, 138, 398 P.3d 712, 727 (2017). 
On March 4, 2019, having considered motions from both 
parties and for good cause, the circuit court entered its Order 
Granting Plaintiff’s Motion to Set Aside Rule 12(q) Dismissal, 
Reinstate This Action and Extend Time for Filing of Pretrial 
Statement. 
That order reinstated Greenspon’s complaint and set 
a new deadline for Greenspon to file his pretrial statement by 
July 1, 2019. 
Construing the March 4, 2019 order “reasonably and as 
a whole,” it is clear that the circuit court’s intent was for 
litigation to resume and, specifically, for pretrial deadlines 
to run. See Nelson
, 140 Hawai‘i at 138, 398 P.3d at 727.  
Indeed, under the then-effective pretrial rules, the filing of a 
pretrial statement triggered a scheduling process that required 
parties to determine dates when trial can occur “within 150-240 
days from the filing of the initial pretrial statement.” RCCH 
Rule 12(c)(2)(A) (eff. 2007). Thus, one necessary and unavoidable implication of the circuit court’s order imposing a 
July 1, 2019 pretrial statement deadline is that the court had 
effectively lifted the stay and restarted the clock. 
This reading of the circuit court’s March 4, 2019 
order setting aside dismissal is not only reasonable, it is 
5  
 
 ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
consistent with the circuit court’s own interpretation. On June 
25, 2020, in making its oral ruling on CIT’s Motion to Dismiss 
and Greenspon’s Motion to Lift or Continue Stay, the circuit 
court specifically stated that “there is no stay in place.” 
Accordingly, we conclude that, as of March 4, 2019, there was no 
stay in place and, thus, CIT’s April 17, 2020 filing of its 
Motion to Dismiss for Failure to Prosecute and Motion to 
Designate Plaintiff a Vexatious Litigant Under HRS Chapter 634J 
was not improper. 
Further, it was within the circuit court’s discretion 
to dismiss the complaint with prejudice and to designate Greenspon a vexatious litigant under HRS chapter 634J. The 
record here is sufficient to support the circuit court’s 
conclusion that Greenspon’s delay in prosecuting the complaint 
resulted in actual prejudice to CIT that could not be addressed 
through lesser sanctions than dismissal with prejudice, thus, the court did not abuse its discretion. See Erum v. Llego
, 147 
Hawai‘i 368, 382, 465 P.3d 815, 829 (2020). As to the vexatious 
litigant ruling, the record also supports the circuit court’s conclusion that Greenspon made “unnecessary and unmeritorious filings” and had “a history of disregarding rules and orders and 
personally disparaging counsel.” 
See
 HRS § 634J-1(3) (2016). 
Consistent with the foregoing discussion, the ICA’s 
December 24, 2024 Judgment on Appeal is reversed and the Circuit
