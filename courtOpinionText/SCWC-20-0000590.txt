CIRCUIT JUDGE KAWASHIMA, ASSIGNED BY REASON OF VACANCY 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, ACTING C.J. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
This appeal is from a dismissal of claims against a 
lender’s attorneys in one of various lawsuits filed by 
Michael C. Greenspon (“Greenspon”). The lawsuits originated  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 from an attempted nonjudicial foreclosure of a Maui property 
Greenspon purchased in 2003 (“the Property”). 
In 2010, Deutsche Bank National Trust Company 
(“DBNTC”) obtained title to the Property after an attempted 
nonjudicial foreclosure sale by a predecessor in interest. 
DBNTC then filed an ejectment action against Greenspon in the 
District Court of the Second Circuit, which was dismissed 
without prejudice. 
In 2011, Greenspon filed a wrongful nonjudicial 
foreclosure lawsuit against DBNTC and others (“Main Action”). Summary judgment was entered in favor of DBNTC. On appeal, in 
2016, the Intermediate Court of Appeals (“ICA”) vacated the 
summary judgment and remanded. 
On remand, in 2018, DBNTC, now represented by Dentons 
US LLP, filed an amended counterclaim against Greenspon and a 
third-party complaint impleading the lender from which it had 
obtained title. DBNTC noted that Greenspon had remained in possession of the Property since 2008 and had not made payments 
toward the mortgage. DBNTC sought to revoke the nonjudicial 
foreclosure and instead proceed with a judicial foreclosure. 
In 2019, Greenspon filed the underlying separate 
lawsuit against DBNTC and Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC (“Ocwen”), 
as well as law firms and attorneys that represented them: 
Dentons US LLP, Alston Hunt Floyd and Ing (which became Dentons 
 2  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
  
    Honolulu), and attorneys with Dentons as well as Watanabe Ing 
LLP. (The Dentons-related attorneys are collectively referred 
to as “Dentons”.) Greenspon’s claims included fraud, unfair and 
deceptive acts and practices (“UDAP”) under Hawaiʻ i Revised 
Statutes (“HRS”) § 480-2 (2008), wrongful foreclosure, and other 
torts. 
In 2020, all claims in the underlying lawsuit were 
settled, except for Greenspon’s claims against Dentons. In 
addition, all claims in the Main Action were settled, except for 
Greenspon’s claims against one set of opposing attorneys in that 
case. 
In the underlying lawsuit, Dentons moved for a 
judgment on the pleadings on all of Greenspon’s claims. Dentons also moved to declare Greenspon a vexatious litigant. The 
Circuit Court of the Second Circuit
1 (“circuit court”) granted 
both motions and entered final judgment. 
Greenspon appealed, challenging the dismissal of his 
claims against Dentons and the vexatious litigant order. The ICA largely affirmed but ruled that “[w]hen considering the allegations in the complaint, and deeming them true as we must, 
the circuit court erred in dismissing Greenspon’s fraud claim to 
1 The Honorable Peter T. Cahill presided. 
 3  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
  
 the extent it alleged fraud on the court.” Greenspon v.
Deutsche Bank Nat’l Tr. Co. (“Greenspon v. DBNTC”), 
No. CAAP-20-0000590, 2025 WL 212336, at *3. (Haw. App. Jan. 16, 
2025) (SDO). 
On certiorari, Greenspon contends that all of his 
claims against Dentons should be reinstated and that the 
vexatious litigant order was improper. We hold that the ICA did 
not err by affirming the circuit court’s dismissal of Greenspon’s claims against Dentons and by affirming the 
vexatious litigant order. 
We also ordered supplemental briefing regarding the 
ICA’s reinstatement of a fraud on the court claim. We hold that 
the ICA erred by reinstating this claim against Dentons. 
Courts must assess the sufficiency of allegations to 
determine whether they meet the high threshold for a finding of 
fraud on the court. Only the most egregious misconduct will 
constitute fraud on the court. Even assuming Greenspon’s allegations against Dentons to be true, they do not meet the 
high threshold required for an independent action for fraud on 
the court. 
We therefore vacate in part the ICA’s April 7, 2025, 
Judgment on Appeal to the extent it reinstated Greenspon’s claim 
against Dentons based on an alleged fraud on the court theory.

  We affirm the circuit court’s August 28, 2020, Final Judgment in 
its entirety. 
II. BACKGROUND 
A. Factual and Procedural Background 
This appeal is one in a series of lawsuits and appeals 
that began with a nonjudicial foreclosure of a Maui property 
owned by Greenspon. 
1. Background up to nonjudicial foreclosure 
On March 31, 2003, Michael C. Greenspon obtained a 
$650,000.00 loan, later modified to $800,000.00, from IndyMac Bank, F.S.B. (“IndyMac”) and signed a note (“Note”) secured by a 
mortgage (“Mortgage”) encumbering the Property. 
On July 11, 2008, IndyMac was closed by the Office of 
Thrift Supervision and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
(“FDIC”). IndyMac Federal Bank, F.S.B. (“IndyMac Federal”) 
assumed control of IndyMac’s assets. 
In November 2008, IndyMac Federal sent a letter to 
Greenspon, demanding payment of $27,664.44 to cure the default on the Mortgage. In January 2009, IndyMac Federal filed a 
notice of intent to foreclose on the Property. In February 
2009, after IndyMac was closed and placed into receivership, 
IndyMac executed an assignment of Greenspon’s Mortgage to 
IndyMac Federal. This assignment was signed on behalf of 
IndyMac by an individual who identified himself as Vice 
 5  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
  
  
 
 
   
 
 President of IndyMac, who had also identified himself a month 
earlier as Vice President of IndyMac Federal. In March 2009, 
IndyMac Federal was sold to OneWest Bank, F.S.B. (“OneWest”). 
In early 2010, a nonjudicial foreclosure sale of the 
Property took place. On February 26, 2010, FDIC, as receiver 
for IndyMac, signed a deed for the Property to DBNTC. On 
March 12, 2010, a person identified as an officer of FDIC, as 
receiver for IndyMac Federal, by Cal-Western Reconveyance Corporation (“Cal-Western”) as agent, apparently filed a 
mortgagee’s affidavit of this nonjudicial foreclosure under 
power of sale. FDIC’s deed to DBNTC was not notarized or 
recorded until April 13 and May 7, 2010, respectively. 
2. Greenspon’s Main Action and appeal In 2011, through counsel, Greenspon filed the Main 
Action against DBNTC, IndyMac Federal, OneWest, and Cal-Western alleging wrongful nonjudicial foreclosure and asserting other 
claims for relief.
2 Summary judgment was granted in favor of the 
defendants and Greenspon appealed. 
On June 14, 2016, the ICA filed a memorandum opinion 
affirming in part and vacating in part. Greenspon v. Deutsche
2 Originally case number 1CC111000194 in the Circuit Court of the 
First Circuit. After the ICA vacated summary judgment in favor of DBNTC on 
Greenspon’s wrongful foreclosure claim in Greenspon v. Deutsche Bank Nat’l 
Tr. Co., No. CAAP- 13-0001432, 2016 WL 3280366 (Haw. App. June 14, 2016) (mem. 
op.), the First Circuit transferred venue of the Main Action to the Circuit 
Court of the Second Circuit, and the Main Action case number became 
2CC171000090. 
 6  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
  
  
  
 Bank Nat’l Tr. Co., No. CAAP-13-0001432, 2016 WL 3280366 (Haw. 
App. June 14, 2016) (mem. op.). The ICA determined that 
Greenspon stopped making mortgage payments altogether by August 
2008 and was in default at the time of the February 26, 2010, 
foreclosure sale. 2016 WL 3280366, at *5. With respect to its 
affirmance of summary judgment on Greenspon’s HRS § 480-2 UDAP 
and fraud claims, the ICA determined (1) none of the alleged 
actions dealt with transactions in which Greenspon was a consumer as required for a UDAP claim; and (2) that “like all 
torts, Greenspon must have alleged that [DBNTC and/or OneWest] 
breached a duty owed to Greenspon and the breach caused injury 
to Greenspon,” and Greenspon did not allege any injury caused by 
DBNTC or OneWest. 2016 WL 3280366, at *7 (citing Exotics Hawaii-
Kona, Inc. v. E.I. Du Pont De Nemours & Co., 116 Hawaiʻ i 277, 
298, 172 P.3d 1021, 1042 (2007)). 
But the ICA found genuine issues of material fact as 
to the validity of the nonjudicial foreclosure procedures 
employed; it therefore vacated the circuit court’s grant of 
summary judgment as to title, and remanded. 2016 WL 3280366, at *2, *4, *7. 
We rejected Greenspon’s certiorari application on 
November 22, 2016. Greenspon v. Deutsche Bank Nat’l Tr. Co., 
No. SCWC-13-0001432, 2016 WL 6879563 (Haw. Nov. 22, 2016) (order). 
 7  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
  
 
 
 3. Dentons’ counterclaims in Main Action 
After the remand from the ICA, on March 21, 2018, 
Greenspon filed a second amended complaint against DBNTC and 
others relating to the origination of his loan, the loan 
modification, the nonjudicial foreclosure, the 2010 foreclosure 
sale, and subsequent eviction efforts. 
On May 16, 2018, DBNTC, now represented by Dentons, 
filed an amended counterclaim against Greenspon as well as a third-party complaint impleading IndyMac Federal. On behalf of 
DBNTC, Dentons also recorded a Notice of Pendency of Action 
(“NOPA”) in the Bureau of Conveyances, noting that the amended 
counterclaim could affect the title or right to possession of 
the Property. On July 5, 2018, Dentons also recorded an 
Assignment and Transfer of Lien in the Bureau of Conveyances. 
The amended counterclaim noted that Greenspon had 
remained in possession of the Property after his 2008 default 
and after the 2010 nonjudicial foreclosure, without any payment. DBNTC sought to rescind the nonjudicial foreclosure, reinstate 
the Mortgage on the Property, and initiate a judicial 
foreclosure. DBNTC also sought an equitable lien, recovery for 
unjust enrichment, and an ejectment of Greenspon from the 
Property. 
The Main Action ended up being resolved by way of a 
June 10, 2020, final judgment; all claims between Greenspon and 
 8  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
  
 
 
 DBNTC were settled, but Greenspon’s claims against Aldridge Pite 
LLP, the law firm that had represented Cal-Western, were 
dismissed by the court over Greenspon’s objection. 
Greenspon appealed the dismissal of his claims against 
Aldridge Pite, and the ICA affirmed. Greenspon v. Deutsche Bank
Nat’l Tr. Co., Nos. CAAP-19-0000391 and CAAP-20-0000442, 2024 WL 2874544, at *2 (Haw. App. June 7, 2024) (SDO). This court 
rejected certiorari on January 21, 2025. Greenspon v. Deutsche
Bank Nat’l Tr. Co., No. SCWC-19-0000391, 2025 WL 252849 (Haw. 
Jan. 21, 2025) (order). B. Underlying 2019 Lawsuit Against Dentons 1. Lawsuit and partial settlement 
In the meantime, in a separate 2019 lawsuit, Greenspon 
sued DBNTC and Ocwen based on the filing of their May 2018 
amended counterclaim in the Main Action. 
In a fifty-eight page first amended complaint filed on 
September 25, 2019, Greenspon added Dentons, a Dentons attorney, and a Watanabe Ing attorney as defendants. Although the Main 
Action was still pending at the time, Greenspon’s first amended 
complaint alleged that the actions Dentons took in representing 
DBNTC, through its filings, recordings, and litigation efforts, 
constituted fraud, unfair or deceptive practices, and other 
 9  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
  
 
   
 
 
 
   
 
 
   
  
  
 
  
 
      
 torts. Greenspon sought damages and declaratory and injunctive 
relief regarding title.  3
On March 30, 2020, all of Greenspon’s claims in the 
subject 2019 lawsuit were settled and dismissed via stipulation, 
except Greenspon’s claims against Dentons.  
2. Dentons’ motion for judgment on the pleadings On April 27, 2020, Dentons moved for a judgment on the 
pleadings under Hawaiʻ i Rules of Civil Procedure (“HRCP”) Rule 
12(c) (eff. 2000), asserting that Greenspon’s remaining claims 
were barred as a matter of law. Dentons argued that Greenspon’s 
allegations were prohibited by the Noerr-Pennington doctrine,  
improperly targeted protected litigation activity, were 4 
3 Greenspon’s first amended complaint contained 14 counts: (I) 
“Fraud/Intentional Misrepresentation”; (II) “Wrongful Foreclosure;” (III) 
“Unfair and Deceptive Acts and Practices in Violation of HRS § 480- 2”; (IV) 
“Abusive, Unfair and Deceptive Collection Practices In Violation of the Hawaii Collection Practices Act § 480D”; (V) “Unfair and Deceptive Acts and 
Practices as Prohibited by HRS § 480;” (VI) “Conversion/Slander of 
Title/Quantum Meruit”; (VII) “Gross Negligence/Recklessness”; (VIII) “Breach of Fiduciary Duty”; (IX) “Tortious Interference”; (X) “Intentional Infliction 
of Emotional Distress (IIED)”; (XI) “Damages”; (XII) “Punitive/Exemplary 
Damages”; (XIII) “Quiet Title/Constructive Trust”; and (XIV) “Injunctive 
Relief.” 
4 In certain circumstances, the Noerr-Pennington doctrine provides 
counsel general immunity from statutory liability for their litigation 
activity based on the First Amendment right to petition the government for a redress of grievances. See Sosa v. DIRECTV, Inc., 437 F.3d 923, 929 (9th 
Cir. 2006). Counsel, however, is not immune from liability for activity in 
“sham litigation.” Sosa, 437 F.3d at 938 (citing Prop. Real Est. Invs ., Inc. 
v. Columbia Pictures Indus., Inc., 508 U.S. 49, 60- 61 (1993)). Dentons 
argued its counterclaim against Greenspon did not fall under the “sham litigation” exception to the Noerr- Pennington doctrine because Greenspon 
“never advanced a viable basis for avoiding his Mortgage, . . . let alone one 
that ma[de] the foreclosure action ‘objectively baseless.’” The 
applicability of the Noerr- Pennington doctrine is not at issue on appeal and 
we decline to address it further in this opinion. 
10  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
    
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 precluded by the litigation privilege and this court’s decision 
in Hungate v. Law Office of David B. Rosen, 139 Hawai‘ i 394, 391 
P.3d 1 (2017), and otherwise failed to plead the necessary 
elements of fraud, UDAP, and related claims. 
The circuit court granted Dentons’ motion. Even 
taking the allegations as true, the circuit court concluded 
Greenspon’s remaining claims were barred by applicable 
privileges and did not state a cognizable claim for relief. The 
circuit court entered a written order in Dentons’ favor. 
3. Vexatious litigant motion 
In addition to the motion for judgment on the 
pleadings, Dentons moved to declare Greenspon a vexatious 
litigant under HRS Chapter 634J.5 Dentons cited Greenspon’s 
5 HRS § 634J- 1 (2016) defines “vexatious litigant” as a plaintiff 
who does any of the following: 
(1) In the immediately preceding seven- year period 
has commenced, prosecuted, or maintained in propria persona 
at least five civil actions other than in a small claims 
court that have been: 
(A) Finally determined adversely to the plaintiff; or 
(B) Unjustifiably permitted to remain pending at 
least two years without having been brought to trial or 
hearing; 
(2) After litigation has been finally resolved 
against the plaintiff, relitigates or attempts to 
relitigate in propria persona and in bad faith, either: 
(A) The validity of the determination against the 
same defendant or defendants as to whom the litigation was 
finally determined; or 
(B) The cause of action, claim, controversy, or any 
of the issues of fact or law, determined or concluded by 
11  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 years-long pattern of frivolous, burdensome, and harassing 
litigation arising from the 2010 nonjudicial foreclosure, 
including more than a dozen lawsuits he filed in Hawaiʻ i, 
Florida, and Delaware, as well as two denied mandamus petitions 
against judges. They also described abusive conduct — personal 
attacks, violation of a civility directive, deposition 
misconduct, obstruction of site inspections, and discovery 
noncompliance. 
Greenspon opposed, arguing HRS § 634J-1 did not apply, 
challenging Dentons’ factual characterizations, disputing 
Dentons’ reliance on Florida and Delaware proceedings, and 
denying bad faith. 
The circuit court granted the motion, noting 
“approximately eight and a half inches” of printed materials documenting Greenspon’s conduct in Florida courts as well as his 
conduct in Hawaiʻ i proceedings. The circuit court took judicial 
 (continued . . .) 
the final determination against the same defendant or 
defendants as to whom the litigation was finally 
determined; 
(3) In any litigation while acting in propria 
persona, files, in bad faith, unmeritorious motions, 
pleadings, or other papers, conducts unnecessary discovery, 
or engages in other tactics that are frivolous or solely 
intended to cause unnecessary delay; or 
(4)
 Has previously been declared to be a vexatious 
litigant by any state or federal court of record in any 
action or proceeding based upon the same or substantially 
similar facts, transaction, or occurrence. 
12  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
  
 notice of a Florida order restricting Greenspon’s filings and 
determined that the Florida matter involved substantially 
similar facts to the Hawaiʻ i actions.  The circuit court also 
made Hawaiʻ i
-specific findings, including that Greenspon 
habitually failed to comply with court orders and that he stated 
he would not comply “under any circumstances.” 
The circuit court concluded Greenspon filed 
unmeritorious papers, conducted unnecessary discovery, and engaged in tactics solely intended to cause delay; his repeated 
filings burdened the court systems (including overtaxing 
Florida’s e-filing system and creating difficulty accessing 
filings in Hawaiʻ i), and that, taken together, these warranted a 
vexatious litigant determination under HRS § 634J-1(3) and (4). 
4. Reconsideration motions 
After the judgment on the pleadings in favor of 
Dentons and the vexatious litigant order, Greenspon moved to set aside the circuit court’s rulings under HRCP Rules 54(b) (eff. 
2000), 59(e) (eff. 2000), and 60(b) (eff. 2006), which the circuit court denied. 
The circuit court entered final judgment 
based on (1) the March 30, 2020, stipulated dismissal with prejudice of claims against the settling non-Dentons parties, 
and (2) the July 7, 2020, order granting Denton’s motion for a 
judgment on the pleadings, dismissing all remaining claims with 
prejudice. 
13  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
  C. ICA Proceedings 
Greenspon appealed the circuit court’s final judgment 
in the underlying lawsuit to the ICA, asserting five points of 
error concerning (1) the dismissal of UDAP claims under HRS § 
480-2; (2) the dismissal of Fair Debt Collection Practices Act 
(“FDCPA”), and HRS Chapter 480D (Collection Practices) claims 
premised on attorney debt collection activity; (3) the dismissal 
of all common law tort claims; (4) an alleged abuse of discretion in granting the vexatious litigant motion; and (5) 
alleged judicial bias. 
In a summary disposition order, the ICA affirmed 
almost entirely except to the extent Greenspon’s fraud claim 
alleged fraud on the court. Greenspon v. DBNTC, 2025 WL 212336. 
The ICA noted that the litigation privilege generally 
bars claims by a civil litigant against the opposing party’s 
attorney. Greenspon v. DBNTC, 2025 WL 212336, at *2 (citation 
omitted). The ICA affirmed dismissal of the UDAP claims under 
HRS § 480-2 based on Hungate, 139 Hawaiʻ i at 405, 413, 391 P.3d 
at 12, 20. Greenspon v. DBNTC, 2025 WL 212336, at *2-3. It 
also affirmed dismissal of Greenspon’s wrongful foreclosure 
claim, noting such claims are not permitted against a lender’s 
attorney and that any abuse of process theory was not pled. 
Greenspon v. DBNTC, 2025 WL 212336, at *3. Additionally, the 
ICA affirmed the vexatious litigant order and rejected 
14  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
  
 Greenspon’s judicial bias claim as waived and, alternatively, 
meritless. Greenspon v. DBNTC, 2025 WL 212336, at *3-4. 
But the ICA ruled that the circuit court erred by 
dismissing Greenspon’s fraud claim to the extent it alleged 
fraud on the court. Id.
The ICA noted its opinion in Domingo
v. James B. Nutter & Co., that “an attorney is not immune from liability or civil damages based upon the attorney’s own fraud 
upon the court in prior litigation proceedings.” 153 Hawaiʻ i 
584, 609, 543 P.3d 1, 26 (App. 2023) (holding that the 
litigation privilege is not an absolute bar against an action by 
a borrower against a foreclosing lender’s attorney arising out 
of the attorney’s fraud on the court in a prior foreclosure action). 
The ICA reasoned: 
In his fraud claim, Greenspon maintained among other things 
that the defendants filed fraudulent documents and made false representations to the court.  When considering the 
allegations in the complaint, and deeming them true as we must, the circuit  court erred in dismissing Greenspon's 
fraud claim to the extent it alleged fraud on the court. 
See  [Domingo, 153 Hawaiʻ i]  at 599-600, 543 P.3d at 16
 -17 
(explaining we must deem the allegation in the complaint as 
true).  
Greenspon v. DBNTC, 2025 WL 212336, at *3. 
Thus, the ICA vacated the circuit court’s final 
judgment only as to the fraud on the court theory and otherwise 
affirmed. 
15  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
  D. Certiorari Application and Supplemental Briefing 
Greenspon timely filed an application for writ of 
certiorari. Greenspon contends all of his claims should be 
reinstated and that the vexatious litigant order was erroneously 
entered. 
We accepted certiorari without oral argument and 
pursuant to Hawaiʻ i Rules of Appellate Procedure (“HRAP”) Rule 
28(b)(4)(D) (eff. 2022),6 we also ordered supplemental briefing 
on the following regarding the ICA’s reinstatement of a fraud on 
the court claim against Dentons: 
[W]hether the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ (“ICA”) 
determination that [ Greenspon] ’s fraud claim survives to 
the extent it alleged “fraud upon the court” is consistent 
with or contradicts: 
(1) this court’s opinion in James B. Nutter & Co. v. 
Namahoe, 153 Hawaiʻ i 149, 153, 528 P.3d 222, 226 (2023); (2) 
the ICA’s opinion in Domingo v. James B. Nutter & Co., 153 
Hawaiʻi 584, 616, 543 P.3d 1, 33 (App. 2023); (3) the ICA’s 
June 14, 2016 memorandum opinion in Greenspon v. Deutsche 
Bank Nat’l Tr. Co., No. CAAP
-13-0001432, 2016 WL 3280366 
(Haw. App. June 14, 2016); and (4) the August 5, 2020 
vexatious litigant order in Greenspon v. Deutsche Bank 
Nat’l Tr. Co., Case No. 2CC191000092.  
6 HRAP Rule 28(b)(4)(D) provides in relevant part: 
Points not presented in accordance with this section 
will be disregarded, except that the appellate court, 
at its option, may notice a plain error not 
presented. If an appellate court, when acting on a 
case on appeal, contemplates basing the disposition of the case wholly or in part upon an issue of plain error not raised by the parties through briefing, it 
shall not affirm, reverse, or vacate the case without 
allowing the parties the opportunity to brief the 
potential plain- error issue prior to disposition.

 III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings 
We review a circuit court’s order granting a motion 
for judgment on the pleadings de novo. See Haw. Med. Ass’n v.
Haw. Med. Serv. Ass’n, Inc., 113 Hawai
ʻi 77, 91, 148 P.3d 1179, 
1193 (2006). 
In a motion for judgment on the pleadings under HRCP Rule 
12(c), the movant must clearly establish that no material 
issue of fact remains to be resolved and that [ they are] 
entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In considering a 
motion for judgment on the pleadings, the [ trial] court is 
required to view the facts presented in the pleadings and the inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light most 
favorable to the nonmoving party. 
 . . . . 
[O]ur task on appeal is to determine whether the [trial] 
court’s order . . . supports its conclusion that the 
[movant] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law and, by 
implication, that it appears beyond a doubt that the [nonmoving party] can prove no set of facts in support of 
[its] claim that would entitle [ it] to relief under any 
alternative theory. 
Id. (quoting citations and brackets omitted). 
B. Vexatious Litigant Determination 
A vexatious litigant determination is reviewed under an 
abuse of discretion standard. Ek v. Boggs, 102 Hawaiʻ i 289,

 IV. DISCUSSION 
A. The Circuit Court did not Err in Granting the Motion for 
Judgment on the Pleadings as to All Claims Against Dentons 
1. The circuit court did not err in dismissing the claims 
for which dismissal was affirmed by the ICA 
Greenspon alleges the ICA erred by affirming the 
circuit court’s dismissal of his claims against Dentons, other 
than the fraud on the court claim the ICA reinstated. We 
disagree. 
Our opinion in Hungate precludes Greenspon’s UDAP 
claim against Dentons. There, the plaintiff alleged that the mortgagee and its counsel conducted an unlawful nonjudicial 
foreclosure of his property
7 and that they did so in violation of 
common law duties and HRS § 480-2.8 Hungate, 139 Hawaiʻ i at 400, 
391 P.3d at 7. The mortgagee’s attorney filed a motion to 
dismiss under HRCP 12(b)(6), which the circuit court granted, 
and plaintiff appealed. Id.
In affirming the dismissal, we opined, “[g]enerally, a 
duty imposed on an attorney in favor of an adversary of the 
attorney’s client poses an unacceptable conflict of interest [and] [f]or that reason, absent special circumstances attorneys 
7 The nonjudicial foreclosure statutes at issue were HRS §§ 667- 5 
and -7 (Supp. 2008) , which have since been repealed. Hungate, 139 Hawaiʻ i at 
398, 400, 391 P.3d at 5, 7
. 
8 The plaintiff alleged these claims under HRS § 480- 2. Hungate, 
139 Hawaiʻ i at 409, 391 P.3d at 16. 
18  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 owe no duty of care to non-clients.” Hungate, 139 Hawaiʻ i at 
405, 391 P.3d at 12 (internal quotation marks and citations 
omitted). Further, we reasoned that allowing UDAP claims to be asserted under HRS Chapter 480 against an opposing attorney 
could compromise the attorney’s representation of the client: 
[T]he role of an attorney involves representing a 
client’s interests against those of an opposing party 
within an adversary system. Attorneys bear a duty to 
zealously represent clients within the bounds of the law. 
  .. . . 
Permitting a party to sue [their] opponent’s attorney 
for [claims under HRS Chapter 480] in foreclosure actions 
presents [a]n . . . issue in that an attorney’s concern 
with being sued by a party opponent could compromise 
[their] representation of the client. 
Hungate, 139 Hawaiʻ i at 413, 391 P.3d at 20.  We 
also noted that an attorney would be “especially 
vulnerable” because actual deception is not required under 
HRS § 480-2, as the “capacity to deceive” is all that is 
required. Id.We explained: 
a plaintiff would need only to allege that opposing counsel 
has breached the statutory duty under HRS § 480-2 not to 
engage in unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the 
conduct of any trade or commerce in a way that caused 
private damages in order to state a claim. 
Id. (ellipses, brackets, and internal quotation marks 
omitted). 
In addition, Greenspon’s claims against Dentons arose 
indisputedly from the firm’s practice of law. Claims by a civil 
litigant against the opposing party’s counsel are also generally 
barred by litigation privilege. Kahala Royal Corp. v. Goodsill
Anderson Quinn & Stifel, 113 Hawaiʻ i 251, 269, 151 P.3d 732, 750 
19  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
  
 (2007). Granted, “an attorney may be liable for malicious 
prosecution if [they] act[] for an improper purpose” and “an 
attorney may also be sued and held personally liable if [they] 
maliciously participate[] in [an] abuse of process.” Id.
(citation omitted). But Dentons’ actions did not vitiate the litigation privilege. 
In Hungate, we did recognize an exception to the 
general prohibition on bringing civil claims against an opposing party’s attorney – the exception for patently illegal 
activities. We stated in footnote twenty-two that “[o]ur desire 
to avoid creating unacceptable conflicts of interest in this 
context, to protect attorney-client counsel and advice from the 
intrusion of competing concerns, and to allow adequate room for 
zealous advocacy, does not encompass, for example, allowing 
attorneys to conduct patently illegal activities on behalf of 
clients.” 139 Hawaiʻ i at 413 n.22, 391 P.3d at 20 n.22.  
Here, there is nothing to indicate patently illegal 
activities by Dentons. Rather, the record indicates Greenspon 
stopped paying the mortgage but was not dispossessed of the Property, and that Dentons — acting on behalf of DBNTC in the 
Main Action — sought and obtained leave to file a counterclaim 
for judicial foreclosure. Dentons followed its counterclaim 
with standard filings of a NOPA and Assignment and Transfer of 
Lien. 
20  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
  These actions are not patently illegal and the circuit 
court correctly determined Greenspon’s claims of misconduct 
against Dentons lacked any factual or legal basis. 
2. The ICA erred by reinstating a fraud on the court 
claim against Dentons 
While otherwise affirming the circuit court’s judgment 
in favor of Dentons, the ICA vacated the judgment to the extent 
Greenspon’s allegations constituted fraud on the court. 
Greenspon v. DBNTC, 2025 WL 212336, at *3-*4. 
For the following reasons, we hold that the ICA erred 
by reinstating a claim against Denton based on a fraud on the 
court theory. 
“This court has defined fraud on the court as a wrong 
against the institutions set up to protect and safeguard the public, institutions in which fraud cannot complacently be 
tolerated consistently with the good order of society.” 
Namahoe, 153 Hawaiʻ i at 166, 528 P.3d at 239 (internal quotation 
marks and citations omitted). In 
Namahoe, we applied the fraud 
on the court theory against a lender to allow relief from a 
final judgment based on an inaccurate and incomplete attorney 
affirmation in support of foreclosure. 153 
Hawaiʻi at 170, 528 
P.3d at 243. Then, in 
Domingo, the ICA recognized a cause of 
action for damages against an attorney based on a fraud on the 
court theory for an “egregious, legally and factually deficient, 
21  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
     
 inaccurate and incomplete, materially false and misleading 
[judicial foreclosure attorney] affirmation.” 153 Hawaiʻ i at 
613, 543 P.3d at 30. 
But not all fraud connected with the presentation of a 
case amounts to “fraud on the court”: 
Fraud on the court cannot be neatly defined, but it 
is understood by courts, including this court, to affect 
more than the litigants in the underlying dispute.    
Cvitanovich- Dubie  [v.  Dubie], 125 Hawai
ʻi [128,]  144-46, 254 
P.3d [439,]  455-57  [(2011)].  Like other jurisdictions, we 
narrowly interpret 
fraud  on  the court.  Compare  id., with  
Ray  v.  Ray, 374 S.C. 79, 647 S.E.2d 237, 239 (2007) 
(“Generally speaking, only the most egregious misconduct    
.  .  . in which an attorney is implicated will constitute 
fraud  on  the court.”) (citation omitted), and  SEC  v.  N.  Am.  
Clearing,  Inc., 656 F. App'x 947, 949 (11th Cir. 2016) 
(stating that the fraud  on  the court  standard “is more 
exacting than the standard for fraud under [Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP)] Rule 60(b)(3), encompassing only 
the most egregious misconduct.  .  .  .”).   Otherwise, 
judgments would remain subject to challenge in perpetuity, 
and the one- year time limitation on motions for relief 
predicated on regular fraud pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b)(3) would be hollowed.  
Namahoe, 153 Hawaiʻ i at 167, 528 P.3d at 240. 
And, in Namahoe, we ruled that courts need to assess
the sufficiency of allegations to determine whether they meet 
“the high threshold for a finding of fraud on the court.” Id.
(emphasis added). Even if Greenspon’s allegations are taken as 
true, there are no well-pleaded, particularized factual 
allegations of fraud implicating Dentons that meets this high 
threshold. See HRCP Rule 9(b) (eff. 2000) (“In all averments of 
fraud . . . , the circumstances constituting fraud . . . shall 
be stated with particularity.”). Moreover, the fraud on the 
22  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 court standard is more exacting than the general standard for 
fraud. 
Namahoe and Domingo are distinguishable from the 
circumstances here. The fraud on the court in Namahoe consisted 
of a deficient and misleading attorney affirmation filed in a 
foreclosure action, which led to a grossly inequitable 
foreclosure of a reverse mortgage for an alleged failure to make 
$500 worth of repairs, which had actually been made. 153 Hawaiʻ i 
at 153, 166, 528 P.3d at 226, 239. The egregious facts in that 
case supported a finding of fraud on the court that warranted 
relief from judgment. Namahoe, 153 Hawaiʻ i at 166, 528 P.3d at 
239. 
And in Domingo, the ICA recognized a fraud on the 
court claim against an attorney based on the attorney 
affirmation this court determined in Namahoe to be so egregious 
that it constituted a fraud on the court. 153 Hawaiʻ i at 592, 
543 P.3d at 9. As stated by the ICA, the affirmation was 
“egregious legally and factually deficient, inaccurate and incomplete, materially false and misleading.” Domingo, 153 
Hawai
ʻi at 613, 543 P.3d at 30.  
Here, Dentons’ attorney affirmation, assuming 
Greenspon’s fraud allegations to be true, contained errors concerning the legal status of which entity held the Note and 
Mortgage after IndyMac ceased operations during the 2008 
23  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
   
 
  financial crisis. Even if there were legal errors in that 
regard, it has been decisively determined that Greenspon stopped 
making payments altogether on the Note by August 2008 and was in 
default to his obligations to some entity at the time of the 
attempts to foreclose. Greenspon, 2016 WL 3280366, at *5. And, 
in contrast to Namahoe and Domingo, there was no foreclosure and Greenspon retained the Property. Even taking Greenspon’s 
allegations as true, in assessing their sufficiency, they simply do not meet “the high threshold for a finding of fraud on the 
court.” See Namahoe, 153 Hawaiʻ i at 167, 528 P.3d at 240. 
Dentons’ filings were not “egregious, legally and factually 
deficient, inaccurate and incomplete, materially false and misleading,” as in Domingo. 
As we made clear in Namahoe, courts must assess the 
sufficiency of allegations to determine whether they meet the 
high threshold for a finding of fraud on the court and that only 
the most egregious misconduct in which an attorney is implicated 
will constitute fraud on the court. 153 Hawaiʻ i at 167, 528 P.3d 
at 240. Greenspon’s allegations do not meet this standard. 
Therefore, the ICA erred by reinstating Greenspon’s claims on 
the grounds they alleged a cognizable fraud on the court claim. 
24  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 B. We Affirm the Vexatious Litigant Determination 
Finally, we address Greenspon’s assertion that the 
ICA erred by affirming the circuit court’s vexatious litigant 
order. 
HRS Chapter 634J applies where a litigant continuously 
makes improper filings or engages in bad-faith litigation 
conduct. Ek, 102 Hawaiʻ i at 297–98, 75 P.3d at 1188–89.  There 
is ample evidence in the record supporting the circuit court’s 
vexatious litigant findings. 
First, under HRS § 634J-1(4), a party may be deemed 
vexatious if they were previously declared so in another court 
proceeding involving substantially similar facts. The circuit court took judicial notice of a Florida court order declaring 
Greenspon a vexatious litigant. 
The circuit court noted that 
those proceedings arose from facts related to this matter and 
other foreclosure-related litigation Greenspon filed in Hawaiʻ i. 
Greenspon acknowledged the connection as he stated in Florida that he was there “because of [his] 
Hawaiʻi state claims.”  
Therefore, the circuit court properly considered the Florida 
court orders under HRS § 634J-1(4). 
Second, Greenspon’s conduct in Hawaiʻ i standing alone 
satisfies the definition of a vexatious litigant under HRS 
§ 634J-1(3). 
HRS § 634J-1(3) defines a “vexatious litigant” as 
a plaintiff who “[i]n any litigation while acting in propria 
25  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
     persona, files, in bad faith, unmeritorious motions, pleadings, 
or other papers, conducts unnecessary discovery, or engages in 
other tactics that are frivolous or solely intended to cause 
unnecessary delay.” 
Contrary to Greenspon’s assertions, the statute does 
not require an explicit finding of “bad faith.” Further, there 
was substantial evidence of Greenspon’s independent vexatious 
conduct in Hawaiʻ i courts. See, e.g., Greenspon v. CIT Bank,
N.A., No. SCWC-20-000055, 2025 WL 2144094, at *2 (Haw. July 29, 
2025) (SDO) (“As to the vexatious litigant ruling, the record [] 
supports the circuit court’s conclusion that Greenspon made 
‘unnecessary and unmeritorious filings’ and had ‘a history of disregarding rules and orders and personally disparaging 
counsel.’”). 
The record is replete with numerous examples of 
vexatious conduct, including Greenspon’s repeated failures to 
comply with discovery obligations and pretrial orders, his 
obstruction of court-ordered site inspections, and his 
submission of inflammatory and improper filings, including in the instant case. For example, during one hearing in the 
underlying lawsuit, Greenspon was instructed to refrain from 
insulting opposing counsel. He nevertheless persisted. 
Greenspon also arrived late to a deposition, refused videotaping 
despite advance notice, and gave non-responsive and hostile 
26  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
   
  
  answers. Due to Greenspon’s behavior, the court reporter left 
the proceeding, prompting opposing counsel to seek court 
intervention. Even after the circuit court ordered the 
deposition to proceed, Greenspon resisted and further delayed 
the process. 
Greenspon also failed to comply with court-ordered 
site inspections between 2017 and 2019, sent threatening emails to opposing counsel warning that entry onto the Property would 
prompt police involvement, and named previously stricken witnesses in violation of court directives. 
The circuit court cited this pattern as evidence that 
Greenspon “habitually fails to comply with court orders” and 
that his conduct disrupted judiciary proceedings. In light of 
this record, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion when 
it determined Greenspon to be a vexatious litigant and the ICA 
did not err by affirming this designation. 
We therefore affirm the designation of Greenspon as a 
“vexatious litigant” under HRS Chapter 634J. 
V. CONCLUSION 
Based on these reasons, we vacate in part the ICA’s 
April 7, 2025, Judgment on Appeal to the extent it reinstated 
Greenspon’s claims against Dentons based on a fraud on the court
