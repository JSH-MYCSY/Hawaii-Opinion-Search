A jury found Chanse Hirata guilty of violating Hawai‘ i 
Revised Statutes § 707-733.6 (2014), continuous sexual assault 
of a minor under the age of fourteen years. 
 Hirata wants a new trial.  He argues two of the deputy

 right to a fair trial: (1) Hirata had “a motive to lie”; and (2) 
the complaining witness (CW) testified “consistent with a child 
who is traumatized.” 
 
We hold that each of these remarks constitute misconduct, 
and that neither was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.   We vacate Hirata’s conviction and remand the case to the 
trial court. 
I. 
 The deputy prosecuting attorney’s (DPA) opening statement 
previewed the State’s theory of the case.  The case turned on 
CW’s credibility. 
Now, ladies and gentlemen, during the course of this trial, 
you will not be presented with DNA evidence, you will not 
be presented with surveillance videos, you will not be 
presented with eyewitnesses, because there is none.  But 
you will hear from the one person that lived through all of 
this.  You’ll hear from [CW]. 
 
 CW testified.  The State also presented testimony from her 
parents, a police officer, a detective who interviewed CW, a 
doctor who examined CW, and an expert in the dynamics of child 
sexual abuse. 
Hirata, his parents, and his girlfriend testified for the 
defense. 
Both the prosecution and the defense acknowledged that the 
case hinged on the jurors’ assessments of Hirata and CW’s 
relative credibility. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

  The DPA’s closing argument circled back to the theme 
introduced in her opening statement.  The jury’s decision “comes 
down to one question, is [CW] believable?”  The DPA continued: 
“the answer is clear to this question.  Yes [CW] is believable.”    
Then to support CW’s credibility, the DPA explained that her 
“brave” testimony is “consistent with a child who is 
traumatized.” 
The DPA began her closing argument:   
[DPA]: Now, at the beginning of this trial I told you you 
were not gonna hear about DNA evidence.  You weren’t gonna 
see surveillance videos.  You weren’t gonna hear from 
eyewitnesses because in a case like this, there is none.  But you would hear from the one person that lived through 
it, and at the end of this, it comes down to that one 
person, comes down to [CW].  And it also comes down to one 
question, is [CW] believable? 
 
Now, the Court gave you the jury instructions that you all 
have in front of you, and on page 8, there are a list of 
factors that you can consider when you deliberate to determine if a witness is credible.  So you look at their 
demeanor, their candor, lack of motive, and if what they 
say makes sense. 
 
So when you look at the factors – and I’ll go through them 
with you, ladies and gentlemen – the answer is clear to 
this question.  Yes, [CW] is believable.  And because [CW] 
is believable, it’s – it is the testimony that has a 
convincing force upon you that counts, and the testimony of even a single witness, if believed, can be sufficient to prove a fact. 
 
So let’s go through the factors of [CW]’s credibility.  Her 
appearance, demeanor, her manner of testifying.  She came 
here last week.  You saw her.  She’s 11 years old.  She was 
nervous and understandably so.  And she tried to be brave 
up there on the stand.  She answered all of my questions.  
She answered all of the defense attorney’s questions.  Almost three hours up there. 
 
And then at the end of almost those three hours, she 
couldn’t be brave anymore, and you saw her when she got 
emotional.  She broke when the defense attorney continued 
to call –  
to question her credibility and if she was making 
this up, and her answer to you was this really happened.  It’s consistent with a child who is traumatized. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

(Emphases added.) 
 
The court’s jury instruction on credibility listed the 
factors the DPA referenced.  Before the closing arguments, the 
court read this standard instruction about witness credibility.  
See Hawaiʻ i Standard Jury Instructions Criminal (HAWJIC) 3.09.1  
Because Hirata testified, the court also gave the standard 
instruction directing the jury to treat him like other 
witnesses.2  Those instructions allowed the jury to consider 
Hirata’s “interest, if any, in the result of this case” as it 
evaluated the weight and credibility of his testimony. 
                                                      
1  The parties agreed to the court’s instruction.  HAWJIC 3.09 (2000) 
reads, in part: 
 
It is your exclusive right to determine whether and to what 
extent a witness should be believed and to give weight to 
his or her testimony accordingly.  In evaluating the weight 
and credibility of a witness’s testimony, you may consider 
the witness’s appearance and demeanor; the witness’s manner 
of testifying; the witness’s intelligence; the witness’s 
candor or frankness, or lack thereof; the witness’s 
interest, if any, in the result of this case; the witness’s 
relation, if any, to a party; the witness’s temper, 
feeling, or bias, if any has been shown; the witness’s 
means and opportunity of acquiring information; the 
probability or improbability of the witness’s testimony; 
the extent to which the witness is supported or 
contradicted by other evidence; the extent to which the 
witness has made contradictory statements, whether in trial 
or at other times; and all other circumstances surrounding 
the witness and bearing upon his or her credibility. 
 
(Emphasis added.) 
 
2  HAWJIC 3.15 (2012 ) instructs: 
 
The defendant in this case has testified.  When a defendant 
testifies, his/her credibility is to be tested in the same 
manner as any other witness. 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
5 
 During her closing, the DPA spotlighted the court’s 
instructions: the jury had to assess Hirata’s credibility just 
like that of the other witnesses and could consider his interest 
in the case’s result.  Then the DPA declared that none of the 
defense’s witness – Hirata included - could be believed because 
“[t]hey have a motive to lie”: 
Additionally, the defendant also testified, and the jury 
instructions say that when a defendant testifies, his 
credibility is to be tested in the same manner as any other 
witness.  So we still need to use – or you still need to 
use those factors on page 8. 
 
So is the defense’s story believable?  We look at the same 
factors.  They have bias.  They have a motive to lie
.  What 
they said doesn’t make sense, and at times, they even 
contradicted each other.  The defense’s story is not 
believable.  The defense’s story is not believable, and 
this is what their story is.  
 
(Emphases added.) 
  The jury found Hirata guilty as charged of continuous 
sexual assault of a minor under the age of fourteen years.  
Hirata appealed. 
 In a Summary Disposition Order, the ICA held that the DPA 
improperly undermined Hirata and his witnesses’ testimony by 
saying they had a motive to lie.  But, it said, this misconduct 
was harmless because “[t]he evidence against Hirata was 
overwhelming.”  The ICA did not address Hirata’s argument that 
the prosecutor crossed the line by claiming the CW testified 
“consistent with a child who is traumatized.” *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
6 
  
In his cert application, Hirata presents a single question: 
“Whether the ICA gravely erred in holding that the misconduct by 
the DPA was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and did not 
violate Hirata’s constitutional right to a fair trial?” 
II. 
 Hirata did not object to the DPA’s closing argument, so his 
appeal is subject to plain error review.3   
 We apply the plain error standard of review “to correct 
errors which seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public 
reputation of judicial proceedings, to serve the ends of 
justice, and to prevent the denial of fundamental rights.”  
State v. Williams, 146 Hawaiʻ i 62,  72, 456 P.3d 135, 145 (2020).    
 Prosecutorial misconduct claims concern violations of the 
right to a fair trial.  That’s a fundamental right.  See State 
v. Williams, 149 Hawaiʻ i 381, 392,  491 P.3d 592, 603 (2021) (“The 
constitutions of the United States and the State of Hawaiʻ i 
guarantee every individual accused of a crime the fundamental 
right to a fair trial.”).4 
                                                      
3  The issues were briefed by the parties on appeal as required by Hawaiʻ i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(4)(D) (2022). 
 
4  See also State v. Yoshino, 50 Haw. 287, 290, 439 P.2d 666, 668– 69 
(1968) (“A fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement of due 
process.  Fairness of course requires an absence of actual bias in the trial 
of cases.  But our system of law has always endeavored to prevent even the 
probability of unfairness. . . .  To perform its high function in the best 
way justice must satisfy the appearance of justice.” (cleaned up)) (quoting 
In re Murchison, 349 U.S. 133, 136 (1955)). 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
7 
 Because prosecutorial misconduct impacts the fundamental 
right to a fair trial, there is no difference between the plain 
error and harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standards of 
review.  See State v. Riveira, 149 Hawai‘ i 427, 431 n.10, 494 
P.3d 1160, 1164 n.10 (2021) (observing that “courts have 
considered the same three [harmless beyond a reasonable doubt] 
factors” when considering prosecutorial misconduct claims under 
plain error review).  
 In prosecutorial misconduct cases, then, once the defense 
establishes misconduct - objection or no objection - appellate 
review is the same: “After considering the nature of the 
prosecuting attorney’s conduct, promptness or lack of a curative instruction, and strength or weakness of the evidence against 
the defendant, a reviewing court will vacate a conviction if 
there is a reasonable possibility that the conduct might have 
affected the trial’s outcome.”  Id. at 431, 494 P.3d at 1164. 
III. 
 Both the motive-to-lie remark and the prosecutor’s claim 
that CW testified “consistent with a child who is traumatized” were prosecutorial misconduct. 
 To the extent the motive-to-lie remark concerns Hirata’s 
testimony (as opposed to that of his parents and girlfriend), it 
is misconduct because it suggests that Hirata had a motive to *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
8 
 lie without presenting 
any evidence in support of that claim 
other than Hirata’s party status.5 
 Our caselaw forbids “arguments that are uncoupled from 
evidence showing the defendant has a particular interest in the 
outcome separate from the generic interest shared by all 
defendants in criminal cases.”  State v. Salavea, 147 Hawai‘ i 
564, 585 n.29, 465 P.3d 1011, 1032 n.29 (2020).6  Our law is 
                                                      
5  The DPA’s motive- to-lie remark is also misconduct because of its use of 
the word “lie” in connection with the testimony of Hirata’s mother, father, 
and girlfriend.  A prosecutor’s use of the verb lie when linked to witness 
credibility is improper.  “The word’s strongly pejorative tone conveys the 
speaker’s subjective disapproval that the witness would taint the judicial 
process with dishonesty. ”  State v. Austin,  143 Hawaiʻ i 18, 51, 422 P.3d 18, 
51 (2018) (Pollock, J., concurring in part).  Prosecuting attorneys must 
scrub lie and its derivatives from their closing argument vocabulary.  See 
id. at 56, 422 P.3d at 56 (barring the use of “ lie” to describe a witness’s 
testimony to “allay[] the uncertainty of counsel and trial courts otherwise 
tasked with determining when the use of the term crosses the line . . . into 
actual impropriety” (cleaned up)).  
 
 The ICA correctly ruled the DPA’s motive -to-lie remark improperly 
impugned the defense witnesses’ testimony.  This is true even though the DPA 
didn’t say that mother, father, and girlfriend lied , just that they had “a 
motive to lie.”  Saying a person has a
 motive to lie implies an opinion that 
the person has lied.  Cf. id. at 51, 422 P.3d at 51 (explaining that “the 
prosecutor’s statement that [defendant] ‘lied to you’ was functionally 
equivalent to ‘I think [defendant] lied to you’” ).  We also agree with the 
ICA that, to the extent this inappropriate remark concerned the credibility 
of Hirata’s parents and girlfriend (and not Hirata himself) it was harmless 
error because there is not a reasonable possibility that, standing alone, it 
would have impacted the trial’s outcome.  This case depended on the jury’s 
credibility determinations regarding CW and Hirata. 
 
6  The ICA cited Salavea in holding that t he DPA’s motive- to-lie argument 
was an improper credibility attack because it suggested to the jury that Hirata had a motive to lie simply because he was the defendant and didn’t “refer to any specific facts or evidence showing that Hirata had a motive to 
lie.”  Implicit in the ICA’s decision was the notion that a juror might 
reasonably believe the DPA linked her “they had a motive to lie” remark to Hirata.  During her closing the DPA mentioned the defense witnesses’ 
testimony.  Next she referenced the court’s credibility instruction, saying 
that Hirata’s “credibility is to be tested in the same manner as any other 
witness.”  Then the DPA immediately asked the jury: “ So is the defense’ s 
story believable?  We look at the same factors.  They have bias.  They have a 
motive to lie.”   The order of operation: mentioning mother, father, and *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 clear: prosecuting attorneys “cannot ask the jury to infer a 
defendant’s lack of credibility based solely on the fact that 
[they are the] defendant.”  State v. Basham, 132 Hawaiʻ i 97, 117,
319 P.3d, 1105, 1125 (2014).  
 In both Basham and Salavea, we gave defendants new trials 
when the prosecuting attorneys suggested they had a “motive to 
lie” to the police (in Basham7) and to the jury (in Salavea8). 
 Here, the State argues that unlike in Basham and Salavea, 
the prosecuting attorney discussed specific evidence justifying 
its claim that Hirata had a motive to lie: “When discussing[] 
Hirata’s credibility,” the DPA “argued that Hirata’s testimony 
contradicted other witnesses’ testimony.”9 
                                                      
girlfriend, next referencing the jury instruction concerning Hirata’s 
credibility, and then saying “ They have a motive to lie,” clearly conveys to 
the jury that Hirata is one of the people with a motive to lie.  The State’s 
briefing does not argue otherwise.  
7  In Basham, we said that the prosecuting attorney’s statement that 
Basham – who unlike Hirata did not testify in his own defense - had a motive 
to lie to the police expressed “a personal view on the credibility of the 
State’s witnesses and the guilt of the defendants.”  132 Hawai ʻi at 115, 319 
P.3d at 1123.  Basham received a new trial.  
8  In Salavea, the prosecuting attorney argued that the testifying 
defendant lacked credibility because she had a “motive to lie.”  Yet as in Basham, the DPA did not explain the defendant’s alleged “motive to lie.”  The 
DPA referenced no specific facts or evidence.  There was nothing behind the prosecutor’s motive- to-lie remark aside from the interest all defendants have 
in avoiding conviction.  Salavea received a new trial.  147 Hawai ʻi at 584-85, 
465 P.3d at 1031- 32.  
 
9  Excluding an eight- page reproduction of the DPA’s summation, the 
argument section in the State’s answering brief omits the words “motive to 
lie.”  And this section only mentions one quote from one case, Salavea: 
“Prosecutors may . . . cite to specific facts or evidence indicating the lack 
of trustworthiness of the witness or defendant when discussing a witness or defendant’s testimony during summation.” 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
10 
   This argument makes no sense. 
There is no logical relationship between the claim that  
Hirata’s testimony contradicted that of other witnesses and the 
claim that Hirata had an interest in lying on the stand.  
Discussing inconsistencies or discrepancies between witnesses is 
a traditional evidence-based method to undercut credibility.  
But that routine credibility attack does not provide an 
evidentiary bridge to support a motive-to-lie comment. 
Here, there were no specific facts or evidence to justify 
the DPA’s credibility attack, only Hirata’s defendant status could explain the remark.  So the prosecutor’s comment was 
misconduct. 
 The State also attempts to justify this misconduct on the 
grounds that it was made “in light of the jury instruction 
regarding credibility.”  But this argument fails: far from 
justifying the prosecutor’s motive-to-lie remark, the court’s 
use of a credibility instruction identical to HAWJIC 3.09 and the DPA’s references to that instruction during closing 
aggravated the motive-to-lie misconduct.  
This court flagged a potential pitfall with HAWJIC 3.09 in 
Salavea.  In that case, this court considered whether Basham’s 
holding – a prosecutor cannot undermine a defendant’s credibility based solely on party status - was inconsistent with 
HAWJIC 3.09.  Salavea concluded that there was no inconsistency *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
11 when the prosecutor supports the inference that the defendant 
lacks credibility with non-status evidence
.  But it did not 
condone the use of HAWJIC 3.09’s “interest, if any, in the result of this case” clause in the way more common situation 
where there’s no evidence other than a defendant’s status as 
defendant to support a credibility attack.  Salavea, 147 
at 585, 465 P.3d at 1032. Hawai‘i
 
Here, the DPA committed misconduct when she stated Hirata 
had a motive to lie based solely on his party status.  This 
misconduct was amplified by the DPA’s references to a 
credibility instruction that, by its terms, generically attacks 
the credibility of testifying defendants10 and, in doing so, 
“transform[s] a defendant’s decision to testify at trial into an 
automatic burden on credibility.”  Basham, 132 Hawaiʻ i at 118, 
319 P.3d at 1126 (cleaned up).  Given the risk that HAWJIC 3.09 
poses to defendants’ due process right to a fair trial, we 
direct trial courts to excise HAWJIC 3.09’s “interest, if any, 
10In our courtrooms the trial judge reads the jury instructions, most 
jurors read along, and all jurors take the instructions to the jury room. 
Then jurors at some point consult the credibility instruction to fact find.  
In most trials, HAWJIC’s 3.09’s “interest in the result of this case” clause 
deflates a testifying defendant’s credibility.  The instruction invites 
jurors to disbelieve a testifying defendant for no reason other than their 
interest in the result of the case, their status as Defendant.  And this is 
wrong.  A ttacking a defendant’s credibility with remarks “uncoupled from 
evidence showing the defendant has a particular interest in the outcome 
separate from the generic interest shared by all defendants in criminal 
cases” is misconduct.  Salavea, 147 Hawai ʻi at 585 n.29, 465 P.3d at 1032 
n.29.12 *** FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST’S  HAWAI ‘I REPORTS  AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***
The DPA’s remark that the CW testified “consistent with a 
child who is traumatized” was also misconduct.  12
A prosecuting attorney has a duty to seek justice, to play 
fair and square.  A prosecuting attorney’s words have an 
outsized influence on a jury.  For this reason, this court has 
often directed prosecutors to not express personal beliefs about 
the evidence.  
See, e.g., State v. Marsh, 68 Haw. 659, 660, 728 
P.2d 1301, 1302 (1986) (stating that prosecutors must “refrain
from expressing their personal views as to a defendant’s guilt
or credibility of witnesses”).
Prosecutors are also forbidden from introducing new 
information or evidence in closing argument.  See Basham, 132 
Hawaiʻi at 113, 319 P.3d at 1121 (“Closing arguments are not the in the result of this case” clause when a defendant testifies 
and there’s no specific evidence to support a credibility attack
other than the universal interest in the result of the case 
shared by all defendants.11  
11The HAWJIC 3.09 clause “all other circumstances surrounding the witness 
and bearing upon his or her credibility” covers other “interests” that are 
useful to evaluating the credibility of a witness and the weight to be given 
to their testimony.  We suggest the Standing Committee on Pattern Criminal 
Jury Instructions rethink HAWJIC 3.09, an instruction that has not been 
updated for over twenty years. 
12The ICA’s Summary Disposition Order did not address this point of 
error.  Hirata’s “Statement of Point of Error” in his opening brief identifies the misconduct he alleges, including the “consistent- with-a-child-
who-is-traumatized” remark.  And his opening and reply briefs urge reversal 
because of this remark.  Hirata’s application for certiorari highlights the 
ICA’s omission regarding this point of error.   13 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN  WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND  PACIFIC REPORTER ***
place to introduce new evidence outside the safeguards of the 
Hawaiʻi
 Rules of Evidence.”).  We have explained that 
“expressions of personal opinion by the prosecutor are a form of 
unsworn, unchecked testimony and tend to exploit the influence 
of the prosecutor’s office and undermine the objective 
detachment that should separate an attorney from the cause being 
argued.”  Salavea, 147 Hawai ‘i at 582, 465 P.3d at 1029.    
Here, the jury heard the DPA opine that the CW testified 
“consistent with a child who is traumatized.”  But it heard no 
evidence  that could legitimately support the prosecutor’s claim 
that the CW testified consistent with a traumatized child.   No 
witness testified about CW’s mental health or psychological 
condition.   1413
 The DPA improperly expressed her personal belief about 
CW’s credibility and injected new evidence by explaining to the 
jury that CW’s testimony is “consistent with a child who is 
traumatized.”  Her unsupported comment invited the jury to infer
that she had undisclosed information about CW’s mental health, 
information that could corroborate a trauma-inducing event like  
13Nor in most cases could they.  See Riveira, 149 Hawaiʻi at 431, 494 P.3d 
at 1164 (explaining that testimony about “a crime’s after- effects are rarely 
allowed” because the information is both irrelevant and highly prejudicial).
14The state’s expert testified generally about delayed disclosure, 
“tunnel memory,” and other dynamics of child sexual abuse.  But the expert 
supplied no evidence about post- abuse “trauma” or how traumatized children 
act or testify in court.  The expert was also unfamiliar with CW or the case’s factual scenario. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
14 
 the charged crime.  We hold that the DPA’s remarks constituted 
serious prosecutorial misconduct. 
IV. 
  
Having determined that both of the challenged remarks 
constitute prosecutorial misconduct, we turn now to determining whether there is a reasonable possibility that this misconduct 
“might have affected the trial’s outcome.”  See Riveira, 149 
Hawai‘i at 431, 494 P.3d at 1164. 
Typically, a trial ends one of three ways: with a guilty 
verdict, a not guilty verdict, or a hung jury mistrial.  So a prosecutor’s improper remarks affect the trial’s outcome if 
there’s a reasonable possibility that at least one juror might have been affected by the misconduct: it just takes one 
unconvinced juror to hang a jury.  The reasonable possibility 
standard, then, is satisfied if there’s a showing that it’s 
reasonably possible that, absent the misconduct, a single juror 
would have voted differently. 
We have historically considered three factors in applying 
this standard: (1) the nature of the prosecuting attorney’s misconduct; (2) the promptness or lack of a curative 
instruction; and (3) the strength or weakness of the evidence 
against the defendant.  Id. 
Here, however, our analysis will focus on the first and 
third factors.  Put differently, the lack of a curative *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
15 
 instruction, though technically a consideration that should 
weigh in Hirata’s favor, does not impact our analysis of whether 
there’s a reasonable possibility that either of the DPA’s 
remarks impacted the trial’s outcome. 
The importance of the second factor — promptness or lack of 
a curative instruction — pales in comparison to that of the 
first and third factors for two reasons. 
First, curative instructions are not particularly 
effective.  See id. at 433, 494 P.3d at 1166 (recognizing that 
“[c]ourt instructions often serve as an unsatisfactory, 
ineffectual fix when prejudicial matters surface at trial”).  
Often, even if a curative instruction is given, its effect is 
minimal. 
Second, because curative instructions are less likely 
without an objection, giving great weight to the promptness or 
lack of a curative instruction factor in assessing harmless 
error makes “a successful appeal easier in a plain error prosecutorial misconduct case.”  Id.  And, in doing so, it may 
even disincentivize defendants from objecting at trial.  We are thus disinclined to “reward” defendants for failing to object at 
trial by giving significant weight to the resultant lack of a 
curative instruction. 
To be sure, a strongly-worded admonition immediately 
following minor prosecutorial misconduct may mitigate the *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
16 
 effects of that misconduct on the trial’s outcome and should be 
considered.  But in many cases, this one included, the first and 
third factors of the harmless error analysis are primary. 
A. 
 There is a reasonable possibility that the DPA’s motive-to-
lie remark affected the outcome of Hirata’s trial. 
We view unfounded allegations that a defendant has a 
“motive to lie” as extreme misconduct.  The suggestion that a defendant’s party status might motivate dishonesty – no matter 
how veiled — meddles with defendants’ constitutional rights to 
testify and not to testify.  
 The choice to testify, or not, is the biggest decision a 
defendant makes at trial.  Our courts do a lot to ensure this 
crucial call is made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily.
15  
Knowing that the prosecuting attorney can generically attack credibility may impermissibly alter defendants’ calculus about 
which constitutional right to choose.

testify and the right not to testify - that happens before the start of trial 
and at the end of trial).

 As we put it in Austin: 
Because such an argument can be asserted indiscriminately 
as to any defendant, regardless of the evidence, it is 
completely unhelpful to the finder of fact.  Moreover, 
arguing that the testimony of defendants should inherently 
be doubted contradicts the presumption of innocence — a 
foundation of our criminal justice system.  That is, a 
contention that defendants are inherently motivated to lie effectively places the burden on defendants to prove they 
are testifying truthfully, which also has a chilling effect 
on the constitutional right to testify. 
 
143 Hawaiʻ i at 56 n.12, 422 P.3d at 56 n.12.  
 
In this case, not only did the DPA launch a generic 
credibility attack, but the DPA told the jury Hirata has a 
motive to lie.  The comment is not a rhetorical device or fair 
commentary on the evidence.  Rather it’s an improper courtroom 
epithet.  See Austin, 143 Hawai‘ i at 51, 422 P.3d at 51 (“[t]he 
word’s strongly pejorative tone conveys the speaker’s subjective 
disapproval that the witness would taint the judicial process with dishonesty, effectively coupling an assertion of the 
speaker’s opinion with the factual contentions that are innate 
in the word ‘lie’”). 
 In cases like this one, where the misconduct was the 
improper suggestion that a testifying defendant had a “motive to 
lie,” and decisions about the “strength or weakness of the evidence against the defendant” hinge entirely on credibility 
assessments, there will always be a reasonable possibility that 
                                                      
the burden of proof upon the government, the right to testify without 
penalty, and the right to a fair trial with an unbiased jury”).      *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 the misconduct affected the trial’s outcome.  We need not even 
look at “the promptness or lack of a curative instruction.”  It 
doesn’t matter.  In a case that turns on credibility, the mere 
suggestion that a defendant was untruthful because of their 
interest in avoiding conviction
 necessarily affects the outcome 
of the trial. 
Turning to the DPA’s consistent-with-a-child-who-is-
traumatized misconduct, we find that it too, standing alone is 
reasonably likely to have affected the trial’s outcome. 
The State argues the DPA’s remarks about CW’s credibility 
were “based on specific evidence adduced at trial considered in light of the jury instruction regarding credibility.”  We are 
unpersuaded. 
Prosecutors recap evidence in every closing argument.  This 
intrinsic feature of summation does not greenlight personal 
opinions.  We were clear about this in Salavea: “a statement may 
improperly imply a personal opinion . . . even if specific facts 
or evidence are invoked.”  147 Hawaiʻ i at 582 n.23, 465 P.3d at 
1029 n.23 (emphasis added). 
The DPA’s remark exceeds fair commentary on the evidence.
Worse, the information resembles prejudicial victim-impact   
evidence.  See Riveira, 149 Hawaiʻ i at 433, 494 P.3d at 1166.  
The DPA effectively hinted she knew something the jury didn’t know: CW presently suffers trauma, and CW’s demeanor and *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
19 testimony match the way victims of child sexual abuse testify.  
The DPA thus expressed a “personal opinion” that took the “form 
of unsworn, unchecked testimony.”  See Basham, 132 Hawaiʻi at 
115, 319 P.3d at 1123.    
Because the prosecutor improperly bolstered CW’s 
credibility and, by extension, undermined Hirata’s credibility, 
the nature of the misconduct factor strongly favors reversal. 
Turning to the third factor, here, the “strength or 
weakness of the evidence against the defendant” pivoted on the 
jury’s decisions about CW and Hirata’s credibility. 
 The State’s opening statement advanced its theory of the 
case; that is, believe CW.  And in closing the State bookended 
its theory: “and at the end of this, it comes down to that one 
person, comes down to [CW].  And it also comes down to one 
question, is [CW] believable?” 
The defense’s theory of the case was the inverse: believe 
Hirata and disbelieve CW. 
There was not, as the ICA concluded, “overwhelming” 
evidence of Hirata’s guilt.  There was testimony that the jury 
could believe, or not. 
In cases reliant on the jury’s credibility findings, 
misconduct attacking a defendant’s credibility or bolstering a 
complainant’s (or critical witness’s) credibility is seldom 
harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  See  State v. Underwood, 142 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 Hawaiʻi 317, 329, 418 P.3d 658, 670 (2018) (explaining that 
evidence of an offense is not overwhelming “[w]hen a conviction 
is largely dependent on a jury’s determination as to the credibility of a complainant’s testimony”).   
 The DPA enhanced the CW’s credibility, and, by extension, 
drained Hirata’s credibility.  Given the evidence presented 
against Hirata there is a reasonable possibility that the DPA’s 
remark about the CW’s testimony, standing alone, contributed to 
the trial’s outcome. 
 We hold that neither instance of prosecutorial misconduct 
that occurred in this case was harmless beyond a reasonable 
doubt.  See Williams, 149 Hawaiʻ i at 397, 491 P.3d at 608 
(holding the evidence of guilt was not overwhelming where the 
complaining witness “was the only witness other than defendant 
who could describe the actual acts” and that “testimony 
constituted the most significant evidence against” the 
defendant).17  There is a reasonable possibility that each

“when a prosecution’s case against the defendant is not overwhelming but

18When the remedy for prosecutorial misconduct is remand, the appellate 
court has not barred retrial.  The judgment establishes that the misconduct 
is “not so egregious as to clearly deny [the defendant] a fair trial, and the 
protections of double jeopardy.”  Underwood, 142 Hawaiʻ i at
 329, 418 P.3d at 
670. From this point on, for appeals that allege prosecutorial misconduct,
the briefs do not need to address the double jeopardy issue first identified
in State v. Rogan, 91 Hawai ʻi 405, 423, 984 P.2d 1231, 1249 (1999).  The
appellate court may order supplemental briefing at its discretion.
