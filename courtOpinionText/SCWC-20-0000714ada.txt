 to help the man.  Shortly after Van Blyenburg hit him, the man 
died.
 
 Van Blyenburg did not return to the scene of the collision.  Instead, he drove to his friend’s house nearby and parked in his 
friend’s garage.  He covered the damaged front end of his Honda 
CRV with blankets and boxes.  Then, he went with his friend, in 
his friend’s car, to Turtle Bay.  
 The State indicted Van Blyenburg for two crimes: (1) leaving the scene of an accident involving death or serious 
bodily injury, HRS § 291C-12 (2007 & Supp. 2015) (Count 1); and 
(2) negligent homicide in the second degree, HRS § 707-703(1)(b) 
(2014) (Count 2). 
 At trial, Van Blyenburg testified to “blacking out.”  He 
remembers driving and then “just nothing” before being 
“jerk[ed]” awake by a “kind of metal bang.”  Van Blyenburg said 
that he looked in his rearview mirror but did not see the man.  
He thought he’d hit a metal sign.  And he drove off because he didn’t want to get stuck with paying to fix it. 
 The jury found Van Blyenburg guilty on both Count 1 and 
Count 2. 
 After the verdict, but before sentencing, Van Blyenburg 
moved to dismiss both counts. 
 Van Blyenburg argued Count 1 was defective because it was 
missing an essential element of the offense it charged.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 HRS § 291C-12(a) requires drivers of vehicles involved in 
collisions resulting in serious bodily injury or death to 
“immediately stop the vehicle at the scene of the collision or 
as close thereto as possible.”  The statute also provides that 
stops “shall be made without obstructing traffic more than is 
necessary.” 1  This “shall be made without obstructing traffic 
 
1  HRS § 291C- 12(a) reads:  
 
The driver of any vehicle involved in a collision resulting 
in serious bodily injury to or death of any person shall 
immediately stop the vehicle at the scene of the collision 
or as close thereto as possible but shall then forthwith 
return to and in every event shall remain at the scene of the collision until the driver has fulfilled the 
requirements of section 291C- 14.  Every stop shall be made 
without obstructing traffic more than is necessary. 
 
HRS § 291C- 14 (2007 & Supp. 2015) reads: 
 
(a) The driver of any vehicle involved in a collision 
resulting in injury to or death of any person or damage to any vehicle or other property that is driven or attended by 
any person shall give the driver’s name, address, and the registration number of the vehicle the driver is driving, 
and shall upon request and if available exhibit the 
driver’s license or permit to drive to any person injured 
in the collision or to the driver or occupant of or person 
attending any vehicle or other property damaged in the collision and shall give the information and upon request 
exhibit the license or permit to any police officer at the 
scene of the collision or who is investigating the 
collision and shall render to any person injured in the 
collision reasonable assistance, including the carrying, or the making of arrangements for the carrying, of the person 
to a physician, surgeon, or hospital for medical or 
surgical treatment if it is apparent that treatment is 
necessary, or if the carrying is requested by the injured 
person; provided that if the vehicle involved in the 
collision is a bicycle, the driver of the bicycle need not 
exhibit a license or permit to drive. 
  
(b) In the event that none of the persons specified is in 
condition to receive the information to which they 
otherwise would be entitled under subsection (a), and no 
police officer is present, the driver of any vehicle 
involved in the collision after fulfilling all other 
requirements of section 291C- 12, 291C-12.5, or 291C- 12.6, *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

  more than is necessary” language (the Traffic Proviso) was 
missing from the indictment.  Relying on State v. Baker, 146 
Hawai
‘i 299, 463 P.3d 956 (2020), Van Blyenburg argued this 
omission violated his due process rights because the proviso 
that stops “shall be made without obstructing traffic more than 
is necessary” is an attendant circumstance element of HRS 
§ 291C-12(a). 
 Regarding Count 2, Van Blyenburg argued it was defective because it did not define “simple negligence.”   
A person commits negligent homicide in the second degree if 
they cause the death of “[a] vulnerable user by the operation of 
a vehicle in a manner that constitutes simple negligence as 
defined in section 707-704(2).”  HRS § 707-703(1)(b) (emphasis 
added).  The indictment said as much.  But it didn’t spell out 
the definition of “simple negligence.”  Van Blyenburg 
characterized “simple negligence” as an element of HRS § 707-
703.2  And he argued the indictment should have defined that 
 
and subsection (a), insofar as possible on the driver’s 
part to be performed, shall forthwith report the collision 
to the nearest police officer and submit thereto the 
information specified in subsection (a). 
 
2  HRS § 707-703(1) reads: 
 
(1) A person commits the offense of negligent homicide in the second  degree if that person causes the death of: 
 
(a) Another person by the operation of a vehicle in a 
negligent manner; or *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
5 
 element in simple terms since its meaning is “not readily 
comprehensible to persons of common understanding.” 
 The circuit court was not persuaded by Van Blyenburg’s 
arguments.  It denied Van Blyenburg’s motion to dismiss as to 
both Counts 1 and 2.  
 Van Blyenburg appealed. 
The Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) affirmed the 
circuit court in a summary disposition order. 
 In evaluating whether Van Blyenburg was adequately 
informed of the charges against him in Count 1 and Count 2, the ICA considered not only the indictment, but also the State’s 
requested jury instructions, which were filed before Van 
Blyenburg’s motion to dismiss.3  The ICA’s analysis was the same 
 
(b) A vulnerable user by the operation of a vehicle 
in a manner that constitutes simple negligence as defined in section 707- 704(2). 
 
3  We have recognized “ that in determining whether a defendant has been 
adequately informed of the charges against [them], the appellate court can 
consider other information in addition to the charge that may have been 
provided to the defendant . . . until the time defendant objected to the 
sufficiency of the charges.”  State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai‘ i 383, 396, 219 P.3d 
1170, 1183 (2009).  The ICA relied on this principle in considering information provided to Van Blyenburg by the State’s requested jury 
instructions in determining whether Van Blyenburg was adequately informed of 
the charges against him.  This reliance was misplaced with respect to Count 
1. 
 
Charging documents “must sufficiently allege all of the essential 
elements of the offense charged.”  See State v. Jendrusch, 58 Haw. 279, 281, 
567 P.2d 1242, 1244 (1977).  If a charging document omits an essential 
element of an offense, it “fail[s] to state an offense, and a conviction 
based upon it cannot be sustained” no matter what other information the 
defendant may have received from the State.  See id.; see also State v. 
Israel, 78 Hawai‘ i 66, 73, 890 P.2d 303, 310 (1995) (“Just as the State must 
prove beyond a reasonable doubt all of the essential elements of the offense 
charged, the State is also required to sufficiently allege them and that *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
6 
  as to both counts.  The State’s requested jury instructions 
included HRS § 291C-12(a)’s “[e]very stop shall be made without 
obstructing traffic more than is necessary” caveat and the 
complete statutory definition of “simple negligence.”   So, the 
ICA reasoned, Van Blyenburg had notice of what he had to defend against.  And the circuit court did not err in denying his 
motion to dismiss. 4
 
requirement is not satisfied by the fact that the accused actually knew them 
and was not misled by the failure to sufficiently allege all of them.” 
(Cleaned up.)). 
 
 Given that the ICA treated the Traffic Proviso as an attendant 
circumstances element of HRS § 291C- 12(a), it should not have looked beyond 
the four corners of the indictment in evaluating Van Blyenburg’s arguments as 
to Count 1.  Only when a defendant alleges that a charging document which 
states an offense is nonetheless deficient because it inadequately informs 
the defendant of the nature and cause of the charges against them – as, for 
example, Van Blyenburg does with respect to Count 2 — may courts “ consider 
other information in addition to the charge that may have been provided to 
the defendant . . . until the time defendant objected to the sufficiency of 
the charges.”  Wheeler, 121 Hawai‘ i at 396, 219 P.3d at 1183. 
 
4  The State filed and served its amended requested jury instructions on 
March 6, 2020, before Van Blyenburg testified.  Those amended requested jury instructions indicated that one of the four statutory elements of the offense 
of “Accidents Involving Death or Serious Bodily Injury” is that:  
 
The Defendant failed to immediately stop his vehicle at the scene of the accident, or as close thereto as possible and return to and remain at the scene of the accident, provided 
that every stop shall be made without obstructing traffic 
more than necessary . . . . 
 (Emphasis added.)  The ICA based its conclusion that Van Blyenburg knew what the State charged him with in Count 1 on these amended requested jury 
instructions. 
 
The State’s amended requested jury instructions – like its original 
requested jury instructions, filed in May 2018 — also recited the statutory 
definition of “simple negligence” found in HRS § 707- 704(2) (2014).  The ICA 
based its conclusion that Van Blyenburg knew what the State charged him with 
in Count 2 on the original requested jury instructions. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
7 
 Because the ICA held that the State’s requested jury 
instructions apprised Van Blyenburg of the charges against him, 
it did not decide whether the indictment, standing alone, 
sufficiently informed Van Blyenburg of the crimes the State 
alleged he’d committed. 
We do so now. We hold that both Count 1 and Count 2 of the indictment 
gave Van Blyenburg adequate notice of what he had to defend 
against. 
Regarding Count 1, Van Blyenburg is correct that without 
the Traffic Proviso the indictment cannot state a HRS § 291C-
12(a) offense premised on the theory that Van Blyenburg stopped 
near — but not “as close as possible to” — the collision scene.  
But the Traffic Proviso is irrelevant to the question of whether 
Van Blyenburg violated HRS § 291C-12(a) by not stopping at all 
or by failing to comply with HRS § 291C-14.  And the indictment — even without the Traffic Proviso — adequately states a HRS § 291C-12(a) violation premised on allegations that Van 
Blyenburg violated HRS § 291C-12 by altogether failing to stop 
(as opposed to stopping too far from the scene of the collision) and by failing to comply with HRS § 291C-14. 
Count 2 is sufficient because “simple negligence” is a 
state of mind, not an element of HRS § 707-703.  The State must *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
8 
 identify the requisite states of mind for each crime it charges. 
But it need not define them. 
II. 
 HRS § 291C-12(a) reads:  
The driver of any vehicle involved in a collision resulting 
in serious bodily injury to or death of any person shall 
immediately stop the vehicle at the scene of the collision 
or as close thereto as possible but shall then forthwith 
return to and in every event shall remain at the scene of 
the collision until the driver has fulfilled the 
requirements of section 291C- 14.  Every stop shall be made 
without obstructing traffic more than is necessary. 
 
 This statute “proscribes an offense that can be committed 
by factually alternative types of conduct.”  See State v. 
Batson, 73 Haw. 236, 249–50, 831 P.2d 924, 932 (1992).  A driver 
could stop at the scene of the collision, but then transgress 
HRS § 291C-12(a)’s commands by refusing, for example, to share 
their name and vehicle registration information with an 
investigating police officer.  A driver could also violate HRS 
§ 291C-12(a) by stopping a ways away from a collision site and 
then taking a long time to return to the collision site for 
reasons other than the need to avoid obstructing traffic more 
than necessary.  Or, like Van Blyenburg, a driver could break 
this law by failing to stop altogether. 
 Defendants “can be charged with having committed an offense 
in two different ways when [they are] alleged to have committed 
it in both ways.”  Batson, 73 Haw. at 250, 831 P.2d at 932.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
9 
 Here, Count 1 of the State’s wordy indictment  charged three 
alternative theories of how Van Blyenburg violated HRS § 291C-
12(a): 5
COUNT 1: On or about August 6, 2016, in the City and 
County of Honolulu, State of Hawaiʻi, GEORGE VAN 
BLYENBURG, as  the driver of a vehicle involved in  an 
accident resulting in  serious bodily injury to or death 
of [decedent], with intent, knowledge, or reckless 
disregard of the substantial and unjustifiable risk that 
he was such a driver, did intentionally,  knowingly, or  
recklessly [1] fail  to immediately stop the vehicle at  
the scene of the accident or [2] as close thereto as 
possible, and did intentionally,  knowingly, or recklessly 
fail to forthwith return to and in every event remain at 
the scene of the accident and [3 ] fulfill the 
requirements of  [3a] Section 291C -14(a) of the Hawai ʻi 
Revised Statutes and/ or [3b] Section 291C-14(b) of the 
Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes, thereby committing the offense 
of Accidents Involving Death or Serious  Bodily Injury, in 
violation of Section 291C-12 of the Hawai ʻi Revised 
Statutes.6 
 
5   As we recently put it: 
 
Charging documents are often rife with superfluous and 
unwieldy statutory language.   When it comes to informing 
defendants of the accusations they face, this legalese 
(though sometimes unavoidable) is no substitute for 
meaningful factual information about the charged violation.  
Details about the who, what, where, when, and how of the 
alleged offense help ensure defendants are properly informed of the charge they must defend against, and this 
court endorses these facts’ inclusion in charging 
documents. 
 
State v. Garcia, 152 Hawai
ʻi 3, 8, 518 P.3d 1153, 1158 (2022). 
 
6  Count 1 of the indictment concluded with the following discussion of 
Section 291C- 14: 
 
Section 291C- 14(a) of the Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes 
requires that the driver of any ve hicle involved in an 
accident resulting in injury to or death of any person or 
damage to any vehicle or other property which i s driven 
or attended  by any person shall give  the driver’s name, 
address, and the registration number of the vehicle the 
driver is  driving, and shall upon reque st and if 
available exhibit  the driver’s  license or permit to drive 
to any perso n injured in the accident or to the driver or 
occupant of or person attending any vehicle or other 
property damaged in  the accident and s hall give such *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
10 
  (Emphasis added.)  
 
Van Blyenburg argues this indictment is inadequate because 
it did not inform him that the stops required by HRS § 291C-
12(a) “shall be made without obstructing traffic more than is 
necessary.” 
In a very limited sense, we agree.  To the extent that 
Count 1 alleges Van Blyenburg violated HRS § 291C-12(a) by stopping near the scene of the collision, but not near enough, 
it is inadequate. 
Because of the Traffic Proviso, the phrase “as close 
thereto as possible” in HRS § 291C-12(a) has a statutory meaning 
that differs from its common definition.  “As close thereto as 
 
information and upon request  exhibit such license or 
permit to  any police officer at  the scene of the  accident 
or who is investigating the accident and shall render to  
any person injured in the accident reasonable assistance, 
including the carrying, or  the making of arrangements for  
the carrying , of the person to a physician, surgeon, or 
hospital for medical or surgical  treatment if it is 
apparent that  such treatment is necessary,  or if such 
carrying is requested by the injured person; provided  
that if the vehicle involved in the accident is  a 
bicycle, the  driver of the bicycle need not  exhibit a 
license or  permit to drive.  Section 291C- l4(b) of the 
Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes requires that in the  event that 
none of the  persons specified is in condition to receive 
the information to which  they otherwise would be entitled 
under Section 291C -14(a) of the Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes 
and no police of ficer is present, the driver of any 
vehicle involved in the accident after  fulfilling all 
other requirements of Section 291C- 12 of the Hawai ʻi 
Revised Statutes and Section 291C-14(a) of the  Hawaiʻi 
Revised Statutes, insofar as possible on  the driver’s 
part to be performed , shall forthwith report the accident 
to the nearest police officer and submit thereto the 
informat ion specified in Section 291C-14(a) of the 
Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
11 possible” as used in the statute may sometimes mean “the closest 
location to the accident scene that does not result in an 
  
463 P.3d at 964.  This discrepancy means that the State cannot 
charge a violation of HRS § 291C-12(a) predicated on the theory 
that the defendant stopped near the scene of a collision, just 
not as near as the statute requires, without informing the 
defendant that stops mandated by HRS § 291C-12(a) “shall be made 
without obstructing traffic more than is necessary.”  See id. at 
305-08, 463 P.3d at 962-65.  Because Count 1 didn’t advise Van
Blyenburg of the Traffic Proviso, it did not state an HRS
§ 291C-12(a) offense based on the theory that Van Blyenburgstopped further from the collision than the law requires.at 307,
unnecessary traffic obstruction.”  See Baker, 146 Hawai ‘i
But Count 1 did adequately state a HRS § 291C-12(a) offense
premised on allegations that Van Blyenburg: (1) altogether 
failed to stop in the proximity of the collision scene; and (2) 
failed to comply with HRS § 291C-14.  The Traffic Proviso is 
irrelevant to these theories of the offense.  The obstruction or
non-obstruction of traffic has nothing to do, for example, with the State’s ability to prove Van Blyenburg violated HRS § 291C-
12(a) by failing to comply with HRS § 291C-14.  For this reason,
the indictment contained all of the “elements of the offense 
intended to be charged, and sufficiently apprise[d] the 
defendant of what [they] must be prepared to meet” despite its  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
12 
 omission of the Traffic Proviso.  See State v. Hitchcock, 123
Hawai‘i 369, 376, 235 P.3d 365, 372 (2010).
 7 
 
7  With this holding, we clarify and limit Baker’s scope. 
  
Baker concerned HRS § 291C- 13 (2007 & Supp. 2015), which prohibits 
leaving the scene of an accident involving vehicle or property damage. 
Compare HRS § 291C- 13 (“Collisions involving damage to vehicle or property”) 
with HRS § 291C- 12 (“Collisions involving death or serious bodily injury”).  
HRS § 291C- 13’s mandates are identical to those of HRS § 291C- 12(a).  It 
requires drivers to stop, to stay at, or return to, the scene of a collision, 
and to comply with HRS § 291C-14.  And like HRS § 291C- 12(a), HRS § 291C- 13 
states that the stops it requires “shall be made without obstructing traffic more than is necessary.” 
 
The facts at issue in Baker were very different than those of this 
case.  And not just because the collision in Baker involved property damage, 
not loss of life.  Baker wasn’t a traditional hit- and-run.  The State’s 
evidence showed that though Baker hadn’t stopped and remained at the accident scene, she did eventually stop, away from the scene, and out of traffic.  And at trial, the State didn’t prove that Baker shirked her responsibilities 
under HRS § 291C- 14: the evidence showed Baker had called the police and 
spoke with an officer after the crash. 
 
With these unusual facts in the background, the Baker court held that 
the State’s complaint failed to state an offense because it did not specify 
“that Baker did not stop either at the accident scene or stop at the location 
closest to the accident scene and forthwith return thereto without 
obstructing traffic more than is necessary.”  146 Hawai‘ i at 308, 463 P.3d at 
965 (emphasis added).  Though our holding that the omission of the “without 
obstructing traffic more than is necessary” language rendered the complaint 
inadequate was made in general terms, the specifics of Baker’s facts infused 
our analysis.  For instance, in explaining the complaint’s failure to state 
an offense, we noted that “[t]he State must prove that the defendant, by 
failing to stop as close to the scene of the accident as possible or 
forthwith return, could have done so without obstructing traffic more than is 
necessary.”  Id.  This analysis is inapplicable in a case like Van 
Blyenburg’s where the State’s evidence and allegations concern neither the 
location of a defendant’s stop (because the State alleges there was no stop) 
nor the timing of the defendant’s return to the accident scene (because the 
State alleges there was no return). 
 
Because our analysis of the sufficiency of the complaint in Baker  was  
animated by the fine points of that case, it did not adequately account for 
the fact that HRS § 291C- 13 (like HRS § 291C- 12(a)) “ proscribes an offense 
that can be committed by factually alternative types of conduct.”  See 
Batson, 73 Haw. at 249– 50, 831 P.2d at 932.  Baker cogently explains why a 
charging document alleging a violation of HRS § 291C- 13 (or HRS § 291C- 12(a)) 
predicated on a defendant’s failure to either stop as close as possible to a 
collision scene or forthwith return to a collision scene must indicate that 
stops required by the relevant statute are to be made “without obstructing 
traffic more than is necessary.”  But its context- specific analysis provides 
no justification for extending this requirement to situations where the State *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

  III. 
Van Blyenburg argues that “simple negligence” is an element 
of negligent homicide in the second degree.  And that because 
the meaning of “simple negligence” is unintuitive, Count 2 
should have defined it.  The indictment’s omission of a 
definition for “simple negligence,” Van Blyenburg maintains, 
violated his right to due process. 
Van Blyenburg is wrong.   
“Simple negligence” is the state of mind
 for negligent 
homicide in the second degree, HRS § 707-703(1)(b).8  Drivers 
commit the crime when they cause the death of a “vulnerable 
user. . . in a manner that constitutes simple negligence as 
defined in [HRS] section 707-704(2).”  HRS § 707-703(1)(b).  
Like the four familiar states of mind defined in HRS § 702-206 – 
intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, and negligently - simple 
negligence is styled as a mental disposition that animates a 
crime’s conduct, attendant circumstance, and result of conduct elements.
9  But it is not itself an element.    
 
alleges an HRS § 291C- 13 (or HRS § 291C-1 2(a)) offense predicated on either a 
defendant’s alleged total failure to stop in proximity to the accident scene 
or non-compliance with HRS § 291C- 14. 
 
8  See HRS § 702- 206 (2014) cmt. (“[T]he legislature also added to the 
Code the offense of negligent homicide in the second degree, set forth in 
[HRS] § 707-704, which introduces a less culpable state of mind called 
‘simple negligence’ – essentially a civil standard of negligence.”  (Emphasis 
added.)) 
 
9  HRS § 707- 704(2) reads: *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
14 
 A charging document must allege the correct state of mind 
for each element of a crime.10  See State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai‘ i 
48, 56, 276 P.3d 617, 625 (2012) (holding that state of mind, 
“though not an ‘element of an offense,’” must be included in the 
charges “to alert the defendants of precisely what they needed 
to defend against to avoid a conviction”).  But it need not 
separately declaim the statutory definitions of these states of 
mind.  
 
(2) “Simple negligence” as used in this section: 
 
(a) A person acts with simple negligence with respect 
to the person’s conduct when the person should be 
aware of a risk that the person engages in that 
conduct. 
 
(b) A person acts with simple negligence with respect to attendant circumstances when the person should 
be aware of a risk that those circumstances 
exist. 
 
(c) A person acts with simple negligence with respect to a result of the person’s conduct when the 
person should be aware of a risk that the 
person’s conduct will cause that result. 
 
(d) A risk is within the meaning of this subsection if the person’s failure to perceive it, 
considering the nature and purpose of the 
person’s conduct and the circumstances known to 
the person, involves a deviation from the standard of care that a law- abiding person would 
observe in the same situation. 
 
10  See State v. Maharaj, 131 Hawai‘ i 215, 219, 317 P.3d 659, 663 (2013)  
(observing that “state of mind is an ‘essential fact’ that must be pled under 
HRPP Rule 7(d)” and that “if a charge is insufficient under HRPP Rule 7(d), then a conviction based upon the charge cannot be sustained, for that would 
constitute a denial of due process” (cleaned up)). *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
15 
 We hold that the State did not need to recite the 
definition of simple negligence in its indictment.  Count 2 
withstands challenge.  
IV. 
Notice plays the central role in our analyses of charging 
documents’ adequacy.  The Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause 
and article I, section 5 of the 
Hawaiʻi Constitution protect 
defendants’ right to be aware of both the charges they face and 
the nature of the proof necessary to sustain those charges.  The 
Sixth Amendment and article I, section 14 of the Hawai ʻi 
Constitution likewise require that defendants “be informed of 
the nature and cause” of the accusations they face.   
 The purpose of these notice requirements is not to 
facilitate obtuse technical arguments about what is and what is not an element of a crime, or about what complex statutory 
definitions should or should not be included in a charging 
document.  It is, rather, to safeguard an accused’s fundamental 
right to know what they must defend against to avoid conviction. 
 Van Blyenburg knew this was a hit and run case.  The 
indictment told him so.  He also knew that, to prove his guilt, 
the State would have to show he caused the death of a 
“vulnerable user by the operation of a vehicle in a manner that 
constitutes simple negligence as defined in section 707-704(2).” Van Blyenburg has not shown the State’s indictment violated his

him.  Haw. Const. art. 
1, § 14.  For this reason, we affirm the

the First Circuit.
