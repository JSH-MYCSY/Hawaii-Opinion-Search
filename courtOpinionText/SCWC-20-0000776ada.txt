OPINION OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J. 
I. Introduction  
 This opinion addresses whether Chief Louis Kealoha 
(“Kealoha”) was entitled to a  city-paid attorney to defend him 
against federal criminal charges.  Kealoha  was Chief of Police 
for the Honolulu Police Department (“HPD”) .  In 2017 and 2018, Electronically Filed

Dkt. 21 OP***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
2 indictments were filed in the United States District Court for 
the District of Hawai ʻi against Kealoha,  his wife Katherine 
Kealoha (together, “the Kealohas”) , and additional HPD officers.  
Kealoha asked the City and County of Honolulu (“the City”) to 
provide him with 
a defense  attorney.  The Department of the 
Corporation Counsel of the City and County of Honolu lu (“Corp 
Counsel”) recommended that the Honolulu Police Commission (“the 
Commission”) deny the request.  After a contested case hearing, 
the Commission ruled Kealoha was entitled to representation.   
The Commission de cided Kealoha met the requirements for  
representation under Hawai ʻi Revis
ed Statutes (“HRS”)  § 52D-8 
(2012) and Rules of the Honolulu Police Commission (“RHPC”) Rule 
11-1(e) (2018).  The Commission concluded four acts alleged in 
the first superseding 
indictment entitled Kealoha to 
representation because they were done in the performance of 
Kealoha’s duty as a police officer, even if unlawful and 
regardless of motive
.   
The City appealed
.  The Commission ’s decision was affirmed 
by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (“circuit court”) and 
the Intermediate Court of Appeals (“ICA”).   The ICA concluded  
Kealoha’s actions were done in the performance of his duty as a 
police officer because the y are the kinds of tasks a police 
chief generally performs.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
3  
Preliminarily, we agree with the ICA ’s conclusi ons that the 
“complaint allegation ” rule governing the duty to defend by 
insurance companies and the “scope of employment” test are 
inapplicable to HRS § 52D- 8 determinations.  We also agree with 
the ICA that Kealoha was not required to testify at the 
contested case hearing.   
 
We disagree , however, with the analytical approaches  and 
conclusions below regarding Kealoha’s entitlement to 
representation.  We  instead hold as follows: (1) pursuant to the 
plain language of HRS § 52D -8, a police officer is entitled to 
representation only “for acts done in the performance of the 
officer’s duty as a police officer” ; (2) RHPC Rule 11- 1(e) 
cannot expand rights of representation conferred by HRS § 52D-8; 
(3) the officer has the burden of establishing entitlement to 
representation;  (4) the Commission should examine the entire 
record to determine whether an officer is being prosecuted for 
acts done in the performance of the officer’s duty as a police 
officer; and (5) based on the record before the Commission, 
Kealoha did not meet his burden of establishing entitlement to 
representation. 
 
We therefore reverse the Commission’s May 10, 2019, 
findings of fact, c onclusion s of law, and decision and o rder 
(“decision”), the circuit court’s December 2, 2020 final 
judgment, and the I CA’s April 21, 2022 judgment on appeal.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
4 II. Background
 
A. Federal indictments 
On October 19, 2017, a federal grand jury returned a 20-
count criminal indictment against the Kealohas, HPD Captain 
Derek Wayne Hahn, HPD Officer Minh-Hung Nguyen, HPD Major Gordon 
Shiraishi, and HPD Detective Daniel Sellers.  On March 22, 2018, 
a federal grand jury returned a 23-count first superseding 
indictment.   
In summary, the first superseding indictment alleged (1) 
Katherine Kealoha, an attorney, was appointed by a court t o 
serve as guar dian of the p roperty for two minor children,  but 
misappropriated trust funds to pay the Kealohas’ personal 
expenses; (2) Katherine Kealoha purported to invest her uncle 
“G.K.P.”’s1 money on his behalf , but actually held the money in a 
bank account to pay the Kealohas ’ expenses;  (3) Katherine 
Kealoha misappropriated the funds of her grandmother, “F.P.,”2 
after convincing F.P. to take out a “reverse mortgage” on her 
house; (4) in order to conceal their actions, the Kealohas 
conspired to discredit and intimidate  G.K.P. by bringing false 
claims of criminal conduct against him; and (5)  the Kealohas and 
the other police officers conspired to frame G.K.P. for stealing 
                     
1  Gerard K. Puana, Katherine Kealo ha’s uncle.  
 
2  Florence Puana, Katherine Kealoha’s grandmother.  
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
5 the mailbox in front of the Kealohas ’ house.  The first 
superseding indictment also  alleged the defendants provided 
false testimony in G.K.P. ’s federal criminal trial  and provided 
false information to the grand jury and the FBI.   
A second superseding indictment returned on May 24, 2018 
charged the Kealohas or Katherine Kealoha only with  bank fraud, 
identity theft, and obstruction of official proceeding.  
B.  Administrative proceedings  
 On March 21, 2018, Kealoha requested that the County retain 
an attorney to defend him against the first and second 
superseding indictments.    
On January 16, 2019, Corp Counsel sent a memorandum to the 
Commission recommending denial of Kealoha’s request for 
representation as to 
both indictments.3  Corp Counsel  opined that 
the conduct alleged in the indictments was neither done in the 
performance of Kealoha ’s duty as a police officer nor in the 
course and scope of his employment.  
                     
3  HRS § 52D-9 ( 2012) provides in relevant part:  
 
The determination of whether an act, for which the police 
officer is being prosecuted or sued, was done in the 
performance of the police officer ’s duty, so as to entitle 
the police officer to be represented by counsel provided by 
the county, shall be made by the police commission of the 
county.  Before making a determination, the police 
commission shall consult the county attorney or the 
corporation counsel, who may make a recommendation to the 
police commission with respect thereto if the county 
attorney or corporation counsel so desires. . . .  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
6  The Commission scheduled  a contested case hearing on 
Kealoha’s request for March 6, 2019.   Before the hearing, 
Kealoha’s attorney, Kevin Sumida (“Sumida”),  submitted a written 
argument asserting the Commission should use the “complaint 
allegation” rule4 applicable to insurance companies in civil 
lawsuits to determine whether Kealoha was entitled to 
representation.  
Kealoha did not appear 
at the hearing, but was represented 
by Sumida.  Th e Commission received in evidence the indictments 
and documents from the administrative record.5  Sumida did not 
present any additional evidence and indicated Kealoha did not 
wish to testify.  
 Corp Counsel and Sumida then presented arguments against 
and for application of the “complaint allegation ” rule.  
Discussions ensued between various commissioners and Sumida 
regarding which factual allegations in the indictments indicated 
                     
4  In the insurance context, the “complaint allegation ” rule imposes a 
duty to defend where pleadings allege claims covered under an insurance 
policy.  Pancakes of Haw ., Inc. v. Pomare Props . Corp., 85 Hawai ʻi 286, 291, 
944 P.2d 83, 88 (App. 1997).  And “where a suit raises a potential for 
indemnification liability of the insurer to the insured, the insurer has a 
duty to accept the defense of the entire suit even though other claims of the 
complaint fall outside the policy’s coverage.”  Hawaiian Holiday Macadamia 
Nut Co. v. Indus. Indem. Co., 76 Hawaiʻi 166, 169, 872 P.2d 230, 233 (1994) 
(citation omitted).  
 
5  Included was correspondence leading up to the hearing, such as  Sumida’s 
letter to the Commission  requesting representation for Kealoha, the 
Commission’s letters to Corp Counsel about the matter, Corp Counsel ’s 
recommendations to the Commission, and letters scheduling the contested case 
hearing.  Also included were numerous documents relating to a February 14, 
2019 letter from Sumida to the Commission renewing Kealoha’s request for 
disqualification of Commissioner Loretta Sheehan  (“Sheehan”).   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
7 Kealoha was being prosecuted for acts done in the performance of 
his duty as a police officer.
 
 On May 10, 2019
, the Commission issued its decision.6  It 
focused on four overt acts by Kealoha alleg ed in the first 
superseding indictment:  (1) causing law enforcement officers to 
surveil G.K.P.; (2) creating a false police report identifying 
G.K.P. as the suspect of an alleged burglary of the Kealohas’ 
mailbox; (3) directing HPD officers to arrest G.K.P. for the 
fabricated mailbox theft; and (4) calling certain HPD officers 
on the phone.
 
The Commission ruled the four acts fell within  RHPC Rule 
11-1(e) “even if unlawful and regardless of motive[. ]”7  For 
example, with respect to the first overt act, the Commission 
stated as follows:   
The Commission finds that the factual allegations in 
Paragraph 37a of the First Superseding Indictment, 
appearing on page 211 of the record, which provide []in 
relevant part that [“i]n or about June 2011, L. KEALOHA 
.
 . . caused CIU officers to conduct physical surveillance 
of G.K.P., and to continue such surveillance from time to 
time through June 2013” a llege acts done in the performance 
of Kealoha’s duty as a police officer because the alleged 
acts, even if unlawful and regardless of motive, were 
incident to: (a) “a required or authorized work -related 
activity”; (b) “a course of conduct taking place at a  time 
that the officer was required to engage in the course of 
conduct by the nature of the officer’s responsibilities as 
                     
6  In a separate findings of fact, conclusions of law, and decision and 
order dated May 10, 2019, the Commission  denied Kealoha’s request as to the 
second superseding indictment.  
 
7  The Commission similarly analyzed the second and third acts.  For the 
fourth act, the Commission  retained the phrase “regardless of motive” and 
left out “even if unlawful.”  
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
8 a police officer;” and (c) “a course of conduct engaged in 
at a place that the officer was authorized to engage in it 
by the nature of  the officer’s responsibilities as a police 
officer.”   See Rules 11- 1(e)(i), 11 -l(e)(ii), 11- l(e)(iii).  
 
(Cleaned up.)   
 
C. Circuit court proceedings 
 
 After hearing arguments, o n November 19, 2020, the circuit 
court affirmed the Commission’s decision.8  In relevant part, the 
circuit court determined: (1) RHPC Rule 11- 1(e) is consistent 
with HRS § 52D-8; (2) the City’s proffered “scope of employment ” 
framework “would render HRS § 52D -8 essentially meaningless, 
unenforceable and inapplicable”;  (3) “the tri partite 
relationship among the officer, the county, and the officer’s 
appointed attorney is analogous to the relationship among an 
insurer, defense counsel, and the insured, and, as such, the 
obligation to defend is determined by the complaint allegation 
rule”; and (4) the Commission did not err regarding the four 
overt acts because the four overt acts “allege typical police 
activity[.]”  The circuit court’s final judgment was entered on 
December 2, 2020. 
D. ICA proceedings 
 The ICA issued a published opinion, City & County of 
Honolulu v. Honolulu Police Commission, 151 Hawai ʻi 56, 508 P.3d 
                     
8  The Honorable James H. Ashford  presided.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
9  851 (App. 2022), on March 16, 2022, affirming t he Commission ’s 
decision and the circuit court’s final judgment .  
 The ICA first determined judicial review was permitted 
notwithstanding HRS § 52D-9’s reference to the “conclusiveness” 
of a police commission’s determination .9  151 Hawaiʻ i at 63–64, 
508 P.3d at 858–59 .  
 The ICA then held the “complaint allegation ” rule 
inapplicable because the obligation to defend under HRS § 52D-8 
is statutory, not contractual, and because application of the 
 
rule would require the Commission to assume the truth of 
indictment allegations.  151 Hawaiʻ i at 64
–65, 508 P.3d at 859–
60. 
 The ICA also deemed t he “scope of employment” test 
inapplicable, reasoning:   
                     
9  HRS § 52D-9 (2012) provides in relevant part:  
 
The determination of whether an act, for which the police 
officer is being prosecuted or sued, was done in the 
performance of the police officer ’s duty, so as to entitle 
the police officer to be represented by counsel provided by 
the county, shall be made by the police commission of the 
county . . . . The determination of the police commission 
shall be conclusive for the purpose of this section and 
section 52D -8. 
 
(Emphasis added.) 
 
As held in Alejado v. City & County of Honol ulu, 89 Hawaiʻ i 221, 971 
P.2d 310 (App. 1998), “HRS § 52D-9’s reference to the ‘conclusiveness’ of the 
Commission’ s scope of duty determination refers to its ‘conclusiveness’ for 
purposes of the City’s review and does not serve to preclude judicial 
review.”  89 Hawaiʻ i at 231, 971 P.2d at 320.   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
10  Nothing in HRS §§ 52D -8 or 52D -9, or in RHPC Rule 11 -
1,
 implicates a police officer ’s “purpose to serve”  HPD (or 
lack thereof),  or whether HPD derived any benefit from the 
police officer’s alleged acts.  . . . It is hard to think of 
any crime committed by a police officer that could  have 
been intended by the  officer to serve the police 
department,  or from which the department could derive any 
benefit.  
 
151 Hawaiʻ i
 at 65–66, 508 P.3d at 8 60–61.  
 The ICA further concluded Kealoha was not required to 
testify at the contested case hearing.10  151 Hawaiʻi at 66–67, 
508 P.3d at 861–62 .  The ICA noted Kealoha had a 
constitutionally protected property right to representation for 
acts done in the performance of his duty as a police officer, 
but that he also had a constitutional right against self
-
incrimination; it was impermissible to make Kealoha choose 
between these rights
.  Id.   
 The ICA also held HRS § 52D -8 requires that the Commission 
consider the police officer’s alleged act, but not the officer’s 
alleged motive.  151 
Hawaiʻi at 67–68, 508 P.3d at 862 –63.  The 
ICA analogized concepts from  criminal law to this situation, 
stating:  
HRS § 52D –8 requires that a police commission  determine 
whether the act allegedly committed by the police  officer 
was within “the performance of th
e officer’ s duty as a  
police officer[.] ”  In making that determination, a police  
commission must consider the allegations made in the 
                     
10  The ICA stated: “ The City also argues that Kealoha failed to sustain 
his burdens of proof, production, and persuasion by failing to  testify during 
his contested case hearing that he intended the  acts for which he was being 
prosecuted to benefit the City .”  151 Hawai ʻi at 66, 508 P.3d at 86 1 (footnote 
omitted).  As asserted by the City in its motion for reconsideration, the 
City never argued Kealoha nee
ded to testify.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
11 charging
 document concerning the police officer ’s acts — 
the conduct  element — and disregard allegations about the 
officer’ s motive  for committing the alleged acts.  
 
151 Hawaiʻ i
 at 67, 508 P.3d at 862 . 
 T he ICA then reviewed the Commission’s analyses regarding 
each of the four overt acts and upheld the Commission ’s 
decision.  151 Hawai ʻi at 68–71, 508 P.3d at 863 –66.  
Essentially, the ICA concluded “[i] t was within the scope of 
Kealoha’s duty as chief to cause HPD officers to surveil a 
suspect
” or “to cause HPD officers to prepare reports ” or “to 
cause HPD officers to arrest persons suspected of committing a 
crime.”  Id.  
 The ICA also stated  that the City did  not contend that 
RHPC Rule 11-1(e) is ambiguous or that it is legally 
inconsistent with HRS § 52D
-8.11  151 Hawai ʻi at 71, 508 P.3d at 
866. 
 Finally, the ICA took judicial notice that a federal jury 
eventually found Kealoha guilty on Counts 1, 2, 6, and 8 in the 
first superseding indictment.  151 Hawai ʻi at 72, 508 P.3d at 
867.  The ICA noted, however, that it “would have been contrary 
                     
11  As discussed in Section IV.C , this contradicts the record.  In 
addition, the ICA appears to have adopted the Commission’s position that its  
interpretation of RHPC Rule 11 is entitled to deference.  It appears, 
however, that the Commission’s position is an interpretation of law, not 
derived from any specialized expertise.  See  Camara v. Agsalud, 67 Haw.  212, 
216, 685 P.2d 794, 797 (1984)  (“[I]n deference to the administrative agency ’s 
expertise and experience in its particular field, the courts should not 
substitute their own judgment for that of the administrative agency  . . . .” 
(emphasis added)). 
   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
12  to the plain language of, and legislative intent behind, HRS § 
52D-8 to require that the . . .  Commission engage in fact-
finding and decide the merits of the criminal charge to 
determine whether Kealoha was entitled to a defense under HRS § 
52D-8.”12  Id.   
E.  Certiorari proceedings  
The City argues the Commission did apply the “complaint 
allegation” rule, in practice,  if not by name.  It also contends 
the ICA erred by rejecting the “scope of employment ” test and 
failing to consider why  Kealoha allegedly directed the 
surveillance and arrest of G.K.P. (for personal gain, not public 
benefit).  The City also asserts the ICA should have considered 
the constitutional concerns raised by the City, because it did 
                     
12  The City filed a motion for reconsideration on March 28, 2022.  The 
City argued: (1) because the ICA rejected the “complaint allegation ” rule, 
the ICA should have vacated the decisions of the Commission and the circuit 
court, which relied on the “complaint allegation ” rule; (2) the relevant 
limiting language in HRS § 52D -8 is “performance of duty” not “acts”; (3) the 
ICA overlooked the constitutional implications of its decision, as taxpayer 
funds may only be used for public purposes; and (4) there are many instances 
where HRS § 52D- 8 could still apply even if the statute required an officer 
to have acted, at least in part, to benefit the City  — for instance, HRS § 
52D-8 could potentially apply to the officers charged in the death of 
Iremamber Sykap.  
 
 
 The ICA denied the motion for reconsideration.  The ICA noted the 
Commission’s order did not mention the “complaint allegation ” rule, and, 
although the circuit court improperly adopted the “complaint allegation ” 
rule, the ICA could still affirm the circuit court’s judgment, but not the 
order, as correct.  The ICA also declined to address the City’s argument 
about constitutional concerns because the City did not raise an 
“unconstitutional as applied ” argument before the  Commission or in its appeal 
to the c ircuit c ourt.   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
13  not waive the issue.  Finally, the  City maintains it did and 
does challenge the validity of RHPC Rule 11.13  
III. Standards of Review 
A. Statutory interpretation 
 
First, the fundamental starting point for statutory 
interpretation is the language of the statute itself.  
Second, where the statutory language is plain and 
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain 
and obvious meaning.  Third, implicit in the task of 
statutory construction is our foremost obligation to 
ascertain and give effect to the intention of the 
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the 
language contained in the statute itself.  Fourth, when 
there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness 
or uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, an 
ambiguity exists.  And fifth, in construing  an ambiguous 
statute, the meaning of the ambiguous words may be sought 
by examining the context, with which the ambiguous words, 
phrases, and sentences may be compared, in order to 
ascertain their true meaning . 
 
Ito v. Invs. Equity Life Holding Co., 135 
Hawaiʻi 49, 61, 346 
P.3d 118, 130 (2015) (citation omitted).  
B. Review of agency decisions 
 
 HRS § 91 -14(g) provides : 
(g) Upon review of the record, the court may affirm the 
decision of the agency or remand the case with instructions 
for further proceedings; or  it may reverse or modify the 
decision and order if the substantial rights of the 
petitioners may have been prejudiced because the 
administrative findings, conclusions, decisions, or orders 
are: 
 
(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;  
 
(2) In excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction of 
the agency;  
 
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure;  
                     
13  The City argues the Commission refused to consider any factors other 
than the three factors set out in the rule, as if the rule confined, rather 
than aided, its analysis.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
14  
(4) Affected by other error of law;  
 
(5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, 
and substantial evidence on the whole record; or  
 
(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized by abuse of 
discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.  
 
(Supp. 2016). 
 
Conclusions of law are reviewed de novo, pursuant to 
subsections (1), (2) and (4);  questions regarding 
procedural defects are  reviewable under subsection (3); 
findings of fact (FOF) are reviewable under the clearly 
erroneous standard, pursuant to subsection (5), and an 
agency
’s exercise of discretion is reviewed under the 
arbitrary and capricious standard, pursuant to subsection  
(6).  Mixed questions of law and fact are reviewed under 
the clearly erroneous standard because the conclusion is 
dependent upon the facts and circumstances of the  
particular case.   
 
A court reviewing the decision of an agency should ensure 
that the agency make its findings reasonably clear.  The 
parties and the court should not be left to guess the 
precise finding of the agency.

., 145 Hawai ʻi 1, 10-11, 445 P.3d 
673, 682-83 (2019) (cleaned up). 
C. Agency rule interpretation  
 
 General principles of statutory construction apply in 
interpreting administrative rules.  As in statutory 
construction, courts look first at an administrative rule’s 
language.  If an administrative rule’s language is 
unambiguous, and its literal application is neither 
inconsistent with the policies of the statute the rule 
implements nor produces an absurd or unjust result, courts 
enforce the rule’s plain meaning.  While an agency’s 
interpretation of its own rules is generally entitled to 
deference, this court does not defer to agency 
interpretations that are plainly erroneous or inconsistent 
with the underlying legislative purpose.

15 IV. Discussion
 
 
A. The ICA correctly held the “complaint allegation ” rule and 
 “scope of employment ” test inapplicable and that Kealoha 
 was not required to testify at the contested case hearing  
  
 Preliminarily, we agree with the ICA ’s conclusions that the 
“complaint allegation ” rule governing the duty to defend by 
insurance companies and the “scope of employment” test are 
inapplicable to HRS § 52D- 8 determinations, and that Kealoha was 
not required to testify at the contested case hearing.   
 
For the reasons discussed below, however, we disagree with 
the analytical approaches  and conclusions below  regarding 
Kealoha’s entitlement to representation.  
B. Pursuant to the plain language of HRS § 52D -8, a police 
 officer is entitled to representation only for acts done in 
 the performance of the officer’s duty as a police officer  
 
 HRS § 52D -8 provides:  
 
Whenever a police officer is prosecuted for a crime or sued 
in a civil action for acts done in the performance of the 
officer’s duty as a police officer , the police officer 
shall be represented and defended:  
 
 (1) In criminal proceedings by an attorney to be  
 employed and paid by the county in which the officer 
 is serving; and  
 
 (2) In civil cases by the corporation counsel or 
 county attorney of the county in which the police 
 officer is serving.  
 
(Emphasis added.) 
 
 Under the plain language of this statute, police officers 
are entitled to representation only “for acts done in the 
performance of the officer’s duty as a police officer [.]”  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
16 Id.  Contrary to the rulings below, HRS §  52D-8 does not merely 
require a determination of whether the acts performed by the 
officer seeking representation are acts generally performed by 
police officers.    
 HRS § 52D-8 does not provide for representation for “acts 
that police officers generally perform.”  If that w ere the 
standard, police officers who effectuate arrest s without 
probable cause for personal, non- law-enforcement -related 
vendettas, or who fabricate and submit false police reports for 
personal purposes, would be entitled to representation because 
arrests and preparation of police reports are “acts that police 
officers generally perform.”   Conversely, HRS §  52D-8 also does 
not limit representation to “acts that police officers generally 
perform.”  For example, police officers do not generally perform 
maritime rescues.  But if an on- duty police officer attempts a 
maritime rescue due to unavailability of other rescue personnel, 
but causes an injury or d eath and is sued, the “acts that police 
officers generally perform” test could unnecessarily restrict 
representation under HRS §  52D-8.   
 Further more, the word “motive” does not appear in the 
statute, and it is also not an  appropriate inquiry.  Rather, the 
plain language of the statute requires that the Commission make 
an overall determination of whether acts of a police officer ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
17 were done 
in the performance of the officer’s duty as a police 
officer.   
C. RHPC Rule 11- 1(e) cannot expand rights of representation 
 provided by the statute  
 
 The Commission and the ICA also relied on RHPC Rule 11- 1(e) 
in ruling that Kealoha was entitled to representation.  RHPC 
Rule 11-1(e) (2018) provides: 
For purposes of this Rule 11, the following shall be 
considered by the C ommission in determining whether “an 
act, for which the police officer is being prosecute d or 
sued, was done in the performance of the officer’s duty ”: 
 
(i) whether the act was incident to  required or authorized 
work-related activity ; 
 
(ii) whether the act  was incident to a course of conduct 
taking place at a time that the officer was required to 
engage in the course of conduct  by the nature of the 
officer’s responsibilities as a police officer; and 
 
(iii) whether the act was incident to a course of conduct  
engaged in at a place that the officer was authorized to 
engage in it by the nature of the officer’s 
responsibilities  as a police officer.  
 
(Emphases added.)  
 As the City argues, although this rule can aid an HRS § 
52D-8 analysis, the statute does not parse out and focus just on 
whether acts are generally performed by police officers.
  In 
this regard, the ICA erroneously stated that “[t]he City does 
not contend that RHPC Rule 11- 1(e) is ambiguous or that it is 
legally inconsistent with HRS § 52D- 8.”  Honolulu Police Comm’n , 
151 Hawaiʻ i at 71, 508 P.3d at 866.  The City’s opening brief 
argued that the Commission’s Rule 11 -1(e), upon which it also ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
18 relied, is inconsistent with the statutory provisions it 
purported to implement.   The City also asserted that  
The Rule on its face is thus contrary to the statutory 
provision it purports to implement, HRS § 52D -8, which does 
not permit representation for conduct “incident to”  acts 
done in the performance of the officer’s duty as a police 
officer, but rather, only for the acts themselves. .  . . 
The Rule is thus invalid.   
 
 We need not invalidate the rule, however, as proposed by 
the City, because “[i ]t is axiomatic that an administrative rule 
cannot contradict or conflict with the statute it attempts to 
implement.”  Liberty Dialysis- Hawaii, LLC v. Rainbow Dialysis, 
LLC, 130 Hawaiʻ i
 95, 107, 306 P.3d 140, 152 (2013) (citations 
omitted).  Thus, we hold that although the rule can aid an HRS § 
52D-8 analysis, it cannot expand rights of representation 
provided by the statute.  
D. The officer has the burden of establishing entitlement to 
 representation   
 
 HRS § 52D-8 provides for representation “[w]henever a 
police officer is prosecuted for a crime or sued in a civil 
action for acts done in the performance of the officer’s  duty as 
a police officer[.] ”  The statute does not create any 
presumptions.14  HRS § 91-10(5) (2012) and RHPC Rule 11- 4(c) 
(2018) then provide that the police officer requesting 
representation ha
s “the burden of proof[ ,] including the burden 
                     
14  See generally H awaiʻi Rules of Evidence Rules 303 (2016) and 304 (2016) 
regarding presumptions.  Adoption of the “ complaint allegation”  rule might 
improperly create such a presumption.  
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
19 of producing evidence ” and “the burden of persuasion ” by “a 
preponderance of the evidence.”  
 Thus, the officer seeking representation has the burden of 
establishing the threshold question of whether the officer was 
acting in the performance of the officer’s duty as a p olice 
officer.   
E. The Commission should examin e the entire record to  
 determine whether an officer is being prosecuted for acts 
done in the performance of the officer’s duty as a police 
officer  
 Pursuant to RHPC Rule 11
-4(b), and as provided in HRS § 91 -
10, the rules of evidence apply in contested case hearings 
before the Commission
 regarding representation requests.  
Alejado, 89 Hawai ʻi 221, 971 P.2d 
310, indicates the Commission 
can and should examine the entire record before it to determine 
whether an officer is entitled to representation:  
In reaching their decision, the Commission reviewed the 
police reports regarding [the alleged victim’s] arrest, 
various sections of the [HPD] Standards of Conduct, HPD’s 
General Order No. 82 –1 on arrests, pertinent  case law, the 
indictment, the civil complaint, and a statement from a 
witness who observed [the officer’s] alleged beating of 
[the alleged victim] and the alleged attempts of witness 
tampering.  
 
89 Hawaiʻ i at 223, 971 P.2d at 312.   
 In contested case hearings regarding representation 
requests, documents other than criminal charges or civil 
complaints, including police reports and witness statements, 
might be available.  Sworn testimony from people other than the ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
20 officer seeking representation c an be presented.  The Commission 
can also consider internal investigation reports, if any exist.15  
As indicated in Alejado, the Commission can also consider  
testimony or documents establishing police officer standards of 
conduct and duties.16  And as provided by HRS § 91- 10(4), the 
Commission is also able to take judicial notice of similar or 
other documents that have not been received in evidence.17 
F. Based on the record before the Commission, Kealoha did not 
 meet his burden of establishing entitle ment to 
 representation 
 
The Commission examined  the record before it to determine 
whether Kealoha was entitled to representation.  But that record 
consisted only of the indictments and certain correspondence 
from the administrative record received in evidence by the 
Commission.  
                     
15  For example, the Maui Police Commission rules provide: “ Upon receipt of 
the police officer’s written request, the  commission shall request that the 
chief or the chief’s authorized designee prepare and submit a written report  
to the commission informing the commission of the current  status of the 
department’s investigation of the matter  with regard to which the police 
officer is seeking legal  representation from the County. ”  Rules of the 
Police Commission for the Maui County Department of Police  § 13-101-53(a) 
(2000).  Honolulu does not appear to have a similar provision.  
 
16  Pursuant to RHPC Rule 11- 4(b), “[t]he rules of evidence as provided in 
HRS § 91- 10 shall apply [in contested case hearings regarding representation] 
except that cross examination will only be provided to the extent that oral 
testimony is heard by the Commission.”  Pursuant to the rules of evidence and 
as specifically provided by HRS § 91 -10(4), the Commission is able to take 
judicial notice of such documents.  
  
17  Thus, the Commission should be able to address the threshold question 
by evidence other than the officer’s ow n testimony.   
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
21  Article VI, Chapter 16 of the Revised Charter of the City 
and County of Honolulu 1973 (Amended 2017 Edition), concerning 
the City’s Police Department, outlined Kealoha’s duties  as Chief 
of Police.18  Section 6- 1601 provides that the Chief of Police 
serves as the administrative head of the Police Department.  
Section 6-1602 is a statement of policy regarding Chapter 16, 
which includes a general statement that the City’s system of law 
enforcement “shall promote the highest possible degree of mutual 
respect between law enforcement officers and the people of the 
city and which shall provide for the expeditious apprehension of 
those who violate the law.”  Section 6 -1603, in summary, sets 
out minimum qualifications for the position of Chief of Police, 
provides for a five- year term, and also provides that the Chief 
of Police serves at the pleasure of the Commission.  
Section 6 -1604 then sets out powers, duties, and functions 
of the Chief of Police: 
Section 6 -1604.  Powers, Duties and Functions —  
The chief of police shall:  
(a) Be responsible for the preservation of the public 
peace; the protection of the rights of persons and 
property; the prevention of crime; the detection and arrest 
of offenders against the  law and the enforcement and 
prevention of violations of all laws of the state and city 
ordinances and all rules and regulations made in accordance 
therewith.  
(b) Train, equip, maintain and supervise the force of 
police officers.  
(c) Serve process and notices both in civil and criminal 
proceedings.  
                     
18  Relevant provisions remain unchanged in the Amended 2021 Edition.  An 
appellate court can choose to take judicial notice of adjudicative facts.

22 (d) Promulgate rules and regulations necessary for the 
organization and internal administration of the department.  
(e) Prepare and, when deemed necessary, update a five -year 
plan of goals and objectives for the police department.  
The chief shall submit the plan and each update to the 
commission for review and recommendations.  
(f) Appoint the deputy chiefs of police.  A deputy chief 
shall have the right of reinstatement to a previously 
occupied civil service position in the police department 
when (1) the deputy chief had held a permanent appointment 
to the position immediately before appointment to the 
office of deputy chief; and (2) the deputy chief ’s tenure 
in the office has not been terminated for cause.  If 
exercising the right, the deputy chief shall be reinstated, 
without necessity of examination, to the former civil 
service position immediately following termination of 
tenure as deputy chief.  
(g) Perform such other duties as may be required by this 
charter or  by law. 
   
Also, under the HPD standards of conduct, officers must enforce 
the law and be truthful at all times, and shall not falsify 
records or commit any criminal act.  See Honolulu Police Dep’t, 
City & Cnty. of Honolulu, Po l’y No. 2.21, Standards of Conduct 
of the Honolulu Police Department, art. VII, § C(16)–(17), (19) 
(2016). 
 The Commission and the ICA focused on four acts performed 
by Kealoha in ruling he was entitled to representation: (1) 
causing law enforcement officers to conduct surveillance of 
G.K.P.; (2) creating a false police report identifying G.K.P. as 
the suspect of an alleged burglary at the Kealohas’ residence; 
(3) directing HPD officers to arrest G.K.P. for the fabricated 
mailbox theft; and (4) calling certain HPD officers on the 
phone.  
 Kealoha had the burden of establishing entitlement to 
representation, but presented no evidence
 in addition to the ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
23 indictments and administrative record letters received in 
evidence by the Commission.19  He relied solely on the “complaint 
allegation” r ule, which does not apply.  Although the 
Commission, the circuit court, and the ICA applied different 
analytical approaches, they all focused on whether four overt 
acts were the kinds of acts that fall within Kealoha’s duties, 
without focusing on whether he met his burden of establishing 
that he performed them in performance of his duties.    
 The record before the Commission d
id not establish that  any 
of the four acts were acts done in the performance of Kealoha’s 
duties as Chief of Police.  On its face, the second act of 
creating a false police report was  not part of Kealoha’s duties 
as Chief of Police.  With respect to the first, third, and 
fourth acts, although ordering surveillance, directing officers 
to effectuate an arrest, and exchanging phone calls might be 
part of the Chief of Police’s duties, here, the first 
superseding indictment alleged these actions were taken “in 
furtherance of the conspiracy” to frame G.K.P.  The first 
superseding indictment charged Kealoha and his co- conspirators 
                     
19  The exhibits before  the Commission did include a September 7, 2016 
letter from Katherine Kealoha to the Commission, in which Katherine Kealoha 
defended herself and Kealoha regarding the alleged “mailbox” conspiracy.  
However, Sumida submitted this letter as part of his request for 
disqualification of Sheehan, not as part of his argument about why Kealoha 
was entitled to representation.  In any event, the Commission did not cite 
the letter, or any other source apart from the indictments, in its decision, 
and the letter did not establish that Kealoha met his burden.   
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
24 with “
improperly us[ing] their authority to prevent the 
discovery and disclosure of [the Kealohas’] precarious financial 
condition and prior malfeasance”; “misusing the resources of 
CIU, by executing unconstitutional searches and seizures, and by 
abusing their official
 positions and law enforcement authority”; 
and attempting to “fabricate, alter, and conceal evidence in 
order to support false claims of criminal conduct by G.K.P. 
. . . .”  
 Kealoha’s duties did not include overseeing a criminal 
conspiracy to hide his  and his wife’s misappropriation of funds 
belonging to others.  His duties did not include conspiring to 
frame his wife’s uncle for a crime he did not commit.  Kealoha 
failed to meet his burden of establishing that he was being 
prosecuted for acts done in the performance of his duties  as 
Chief of Police.20  Hence, the Commission’s decision was clearly 
erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial 
evidence on the whole record. 
V. Conclusion 
This case  involves a highly unusual representation request 
made by the Chief of Police.  The criminal charges against 
Kealoha were extraordinary.   
                     
20  We also note that with respect to the “mailbox conspiracy,” Kealoha was 
reporting a purported but false “crime” as an alleged “victim,” not as a 
police officer. 
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
25 We note that the stated purpose of HRS § 52D -8 is to 
maintain “the morale of the force [.]”  See S. Stand. Comm. Rep. 
No. 376, in 1941 Senate Journal, at 860 –61.  Con sistent with 
this purpose, both HRS § 52D-8 and RHPC Rule 11- 1(e) contain 
broad language entitling  police officers to representation in 
most circumstances.  Even if acts purportedly exceeding a police 
officer’s duty as a police officer are alleged, such as  use of 
unreasonable force or driving at excessive speeds to effectuate 
a legitimate arrest, representation sh ould be available because 
the officer was initially acting to perform the officer’s duty 
as a police officer.  
But nothing in this  record indicated that Kealoha was 
acting in any way to perform his duties as Chief of Police. 
Finally, we also note that H RS § 52D -8 is also for the 
benefit of the public:   
 The duties of a [police officer ] are performed for 
the benefit of the public. . . .  [I]t is for the public 
good that these officers, as instruments through which the 
city performs its functions, shall be shielded from the 
personal hazards which attend the discharge of their 
official duties.  With such protection afforded, the public 
can expect that its laws will be zealously enforced without 
any hesitation occasioned by considerations of possible 
personal involvement in defending resulting litigation.

In conclusion, for  the reasons discussed in Section IV, we 
reverse the Commission’s May 10, 2019, findings of fact, 
conclusions of l aw, and decision and o rder, the circuit court’s 
December 2, 2020, final judgment, and the ICA’s April 21, 2022 
judgment on appeal.22

on article V II, section 4 of the Hawai‘ i Constitution , which provides, “[n]o 
tax shall be levied or appropriation of public money or property made , . . .  
directly or indirectly, except for a public purpose. ”   
 
22  The record does not reflect whether the City did actually retain an 
attorney to defend Kealoha with respect to the first superseding indictment; 
we do not address whether there are any possible financial consequences of 
this opinion.
