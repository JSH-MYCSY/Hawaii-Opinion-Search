CHEYENNE BELFORD, 
Petitioner/Plaintiff-Appellant, 
 
vs. 
 
STATE OF HAWAIʻ I,  
Respondent/Defendant-Appellee. 
CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
(CAAP-21-0000007; CASE NO. 1CC171001287) 
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., McKenna, Eddins, Ginoza, and Devens, JJ.)  
Petitioner/Plaintiff-Appellant Cheyenne Belford 
severed part of her finger with a circular saw during a prison 
workline training class at the Women’s Community Correctional 
Center, where she was incarcerated. At the time of her injury, her instructor had left the immediate area to assist other 
inmates. Belford brought an action in the Circuit Court of the 
First Circuit (circuit court) against the State of 
Hawaiʻi, 
alleging negligent instruction and supervision. Following a  
 
  
 
   
  
 ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
bench trial,1 the circuit court concluded that Belford’s injuries 
were not legally caused by the State, which owed a general duty 
of reasonable care to prevent foreseeable injury to persons in 
its custody. (Citing Figueroa v. State, 61 Haw. 369, 376, 604 
P.2d 1198, 1201 (1979)). The circuit court found that, under 
the circumstances, the State had not breached its duty to 
reasonably supervise or train Belford in the operation of a 
circular saw. Final judgment was entered in favor of the State, 
which was awarded costs in the amount of $2,544.41 as the 
prevailing party under Rule 54(d)(1) (eff. 2000) of the Hawaiʻ i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP).2 
Belford timely appealed both the circuit court’s 
determination of liability and the award of costs to the State. 
The Intermediate Court of Appeals affirmed and Belford sought 
review by this court. 
Belford argues that the State owes a heightened duty 
to workline prisoners under Haworth v. State, 60 Haw. 557, 592 
P.2d 820 (1979). Belford also challenges the circuit court’s 
weighing of the evidence at trial, arguing that there was 
insufficient evidence to support the circuit court’s finding 
1 The Honorable Bert I. Ayabe presiding. 
2 HRCP Rule 54(d)(1) provides in relevant part: “Except when 
express provision therefor is made either in a statute or in these rules, 
costs shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court 
otherwise directs[.]” 
2  
 
 ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
that the State had provided reasonable training and supervision 
under the circumstances. Finally, Belford contends that the 
circuit court abused its discretion when it awarded costs to the 
State against an indigent defendant. 
“[T]his court reviews a trial court’s conclusion of 
law with regard to the duty of care that a defendant owes to a 
plaintiff in a negligence action ‘de novo, under the right/wrong 
standard’ of review.” Doe Parents No. 1 v. State, Dep’t of
Educ., 100 Hawaiʻ i 34, 57, 58 P.3d 545, 568 (2002), as amended 
(Dec. 5, 2002) (brackets omitted) (quoting Ruf v. Honolulu 
Police Dep’t, 89 Hawaiʻ i 315, 320, 972 P.2d 1081, 1086 (1999)). 
However, conclusions of law that present mixed questions of fact 
and law will not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous. Chun v.
Bd. of Trs. of the Emps.’ Ret. Sys. of the State of Haw., 106 
Hawaiʻi 416, 430, 106 P.3d 339, 353 (2005). A mixed question of 
law or fact is not clearly erroneous unless it is not supported 
by substantial evidence, which is to say “credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a 
person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion.” Leslie
v. Estate of Tavares, 91 Hawaiʻ i 394, 399, 984 P.2d 1220, 1225 
(1999) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) (quoting 
State v. Kotis, 91 Hawaiʻ i 319, 328, 984 P.2d 78, 87 (1999)).  
“[T]he credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given their 
testimony are within the province of the trier of fact and, 
3  
 
  
   
 
 
  
   
 ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
generally, will not be disturbed on appeal.” Tamashiro v.
Control Specialist, Inc., 97 Hawaiʻ i 86, 92, 34 P.3d 16, 22 
(2001) (citation omitted). 
To the extent that Belford argues the circuit court 
erred in concluding that the State did not breach its duty of 
care to Belford under the facts of this case, we disagree. 
Belford’s argument that Haworth imposes a heightened duty of 
care on the State in the context of prison workline injuries is 
without merit. Our caselaw is clear: the same general 
principles of tort liability that apply to private individuals 
apply to the State in a correctional setting. Figueroa, 61 Haw. 
at 375-76, 604 P.2d at 1202; Doe Parents, 100 Hawaiʻ i at 71-72, 
58 P.3d at 82-83 (footnote omitted) (“[I]f the State has entered 
into a custodial relationship with a particular person, then the 
State owes that person an affirmative duty to take reasonable steps to prevent any harm—which the State foresees or should 
reasonably anticipate—befalling its ward, either by his or her 
own hand or by that of another.”). Nothing in Haworth
 demands a 
different outcome.3 Instead, this court made clear in Haworth 
3 Haworth involved an injury sustained by a prisoner while working 
at the minimum- security Olinda Honor Camp, where he was “required” to remove 
rocks from an embankment at a roadwork project. 60 Haw. at 557, 592 P.2d at 
821. The trial court concluded that the prisoner’s own negligence 
proximately caused his injury. Id. at 559, 592 P.2d at 822. 
The Hawaiʻi 
Supreme Court disagreed, holding that assumption of the risk does not apply 
in the context of prison labor because the doctrine of assumption of the risk 
is premised upon the employee’s capacity to voluntarily accept or reject 
employment, which is not present for prison laborers. Id. at 561
-62, 592 
(. . . continued) 
4  
 
  
 ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
that the State’s duty to prevent foreseeable injuries to those 
in custody is the general duty of reasonable care under the 
circumstances. 60 Haw. at 565, 592 P.2d at 825 (“Since the 
danger arose from the exercise of the State’s authority over 
appellant as a prisoner, a duty to exercise reasonable care to 
avoid the danger arose on familiar tort principles.”). 
To the extent that Belford challenges the weight and 
sufficiency of the evidence adduced at trial, we also disagree. 
There is substantial evidence in the record to support the circuit court’s conclusions that: (1) Beford was reasonably 
trained under the circumstances since she was competent and 
trained to safely operate a circular saw; and (2) the State’s 
intermittent supervision of Belford was reasonable under the 
circumstances since it was consistent with the procedures and 
policies of the Department of Public Safety, and Belford’s 
history of misconduct was not of the type that could reasonably have put the State on notice that Belford would improperly 
operate a circular saw. Thus, the circuit court’s mixed 
(continued . . .) 
P.2d at 823- 24.   Instead,  as this court explained in Haworth,  “we have 
recognized a duty of the State to exercise ordinary care for the safety of 
prisoners in its custody.”  Id. at 563, 592 P.2d at 824 (citing Upchurch v. 
State, 51 Haw. 150, 454 P.2d 112 (1969)).   Because the record was 
insufficient as to the exercise of reasonable care by the State in this 
context, the Haworth  court remanded for further proceedings.   Id.  at 565, 592 
P.2d at 826.  
5  
 
  
 ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
conclusions of fact and law were not clearly erroneous. See
Leslie, 91 Hawaiʻi at 399, 984 P.2d at 1225. 
However, to the extent that Belford argues that the 
circuit court abused its discretion when it awarded costs to the 
State, we agree. 
“The award of a taxable cost is within the discretion 
of the trial court and will not be disturbed absent a clear 
abuse of discretion.” Wong v. Takeuchi
, 88 Hawaiʻi 46, 52, 961 
P.2d 611, 617 (1998) (quoting 
Bjornen v. State Farm Fire & Cas. 
Co.
, 81 Hawaiʻi 105, 107, 912 P.2d 602, 604 (App. 1996)).  “An 
abuse of discretion occurs when the circuit court has clearly 
exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles 
of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party 
litigant.” Pulawa v. GTE Hawaiian Tel
, 112 Hawaiʻi 3, 11, 143 
P.3d 1205, 1213 (2006) (brackets omitted) (quoting 
Hac v. Univ. 
of Haw.
, 102 Hawaiʻi 92, 101, 73 P.3d 46, 55 (2003)). 
On August 6, 2020, Belford filed a Motion to Review 
and Disallow Costs. 
Belford’s motion was supported by a 
declaration from Belford’s attorney that stated in relevant 
part: 
(2) At the time Plaintiff was injured and during the 
course of the trial in this case she was incarcerated and 
had no earnings, income, or assets of any significant 
value. 
(3) As the Court well knows, this was not a frivolous 
case, and Plaintiff suffered a serious injury from which she is and will be permanently disabled. 
6  
 
  
 ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
(4) In light of these circumstances, it is 
unconscionable for the State of Hawaiʻ i to seek and for this 
Court to allow costs to be taxed against the Plaintiff as a 
penalty for bringing her legitimate and meritorious claims. 
Then, on December 10, 2020, Belford moved ex parte to 
proceed in forma pauperis on appeal, which the circuit court 
granted on December 23, 2020, the same day the circuit court 
entered its written order denying Belford’s Motion to Review and 
Disallow Costs. The December 10, 2020 motion was supported by a 
declaration from Belford, in which Belford averred that “because 
of my poverty, I am unable to pay the costs of said proceedings 
[on appeal].” In her declaration, Belford stated that, at that 
time, she was living “in a clean and sober house” following her “recent[]” release from the Women’s Community Correctional 
Center. She declared that she made between $300-$400 per month 
while working at a restaurant and that, in addition to her 
wages, “I receive $388 per month from welfare currently, and 
approximately $240 in food stamps monthly.” Belford further 
stated that she had no cash or checking or savings accounts, and 
that she did not own any valuable property, including real estate, stocks, bonds, notes, or automobiles. 
Thus, viewed at the time the circuit court’s written 
order was entered on December 23, 2020, it was inequitable for 
the circuit court to award $2,544.41 in costs to the State 
against an indigent plaintiff who brought a reasonable, non-
frivolous claim for a disabling injury that occurred on a prison 
7  
 
  ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
workline where she was paid $0.25 an hour for her labor, 
especially because the taxed costs amount to more than 6 to 8 
months’ worth of her wages combined. See Pulawa, 112 Hawaiʻ i at 
11, 143 P.3d at 1213; cf. Knox v. City of Fresno, 208 F.Supp.3d 
1114 (E.D.Cal. 2016) (holding that an award of costs against 
relatives of a mentally ill woman who was shot and killed by 
police would be “inequitable”). This outcome is particularly 
inequitable because participation in a prison workline was 
necessary to transition to work furlough and ultimately to 
parole. On these facts, we hold that the circuit court erred 
when it awarded the State costs against Belford. 
Accordingly, the ICA’s January 15, 2025 Judgment on 
Appeal and the Circuit Court’s January 5, 2021 Final Judgment are reversed to the extent they award costs in favor of the 
State and against Belford. The ICA’s January 15, 2025 Judgment 
on Appeal is otherwise affirmed.
