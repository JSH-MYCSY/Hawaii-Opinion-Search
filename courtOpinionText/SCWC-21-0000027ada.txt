OPINION OF THE COURT BY McKENNA , J.  
 
I. Introduction  
 
 This opinion addresses whether a district court has subject 
matter jurisdiction to rule on a Hawai ʻi Revised Statutes (“HRS”) 
§ 604-10.5 petition to enjoin harassment (“injunction petition”) 
after ninety days elapses from issuance of an ex parte temporary 
restraining order (“TRO”).  We hold the Intermediate Court of Electronically Filed

Dkt. 18 OPA***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 2  Appeals (“ICA”) correctly held the district court has such 
jurisdiction.   
 
Due to public safety implications, however, we also address 
an issue the ICA did not: whether an HRS § 604- 10.5 TRO expires 
after ninety days despite district court orders continuing the 
TRO beyond ninety days pending completion of a hearing and 
decision on the injunction petition.  
 For the reasons explained below, w
e hold that  if a district 
court has commenced hearing the merits of an HRS § 604- 10.5 
injunction petition  but, despite reasonable efforts, is unable 
to conclude the hearing within ninety days of issuance of the ex 
parte TRO, it has jurisdiction and discretion to continue the 
TRO pending its final decision on the injunction petition as 
long as standards for issuance of temporary injunctive relief 
are met.1   
 We therefore affirm the ICA’s Novem ber 1, 2022 judgment on 
appeal, subject to the clarifications in this opinion.  
II. Background
 
 
A. District court proceedings   
 
 1. The petition 
 On June 1, 2020, Kieu Meyer, Stephen Meyer, and Kieu Meyer 
on behalf of a minor child (collectively “ the Meyers”), filed a 
                                                 
1  Under the circumstances of this case, we need not address whether the 
Meyers’ TRO was properly continued past ninety days.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 3 petition against their neighbors James Basco, aka “Tony Basco ,” 
and Mary Basco (collectively “ the Bascos”)  in the District C ourt 
of the Second Circuit (“district court”).  The petition 
requested a ninety
-day TRO to be followed by a three-year 
injunction against harassment pursuant to HRS § 604-10.5 (2016 & 
Supp. 2019).2  The Meyers alleged disturbing incidents by the 
                                                 
2  HRS § 604- 10.5 (2016 & Supp. 2019) provided in relevant part : 
 
§604-10.5  Power to enjoin and temporarily restrain 
harassment.   (a)  For the purposes of this section:  
"Course of conduct"  means a pattern of conduct composed of 
a series of acts over any period of time evidencing a 
continuity of purpose.  
"Harassment" means:  
      (1)  Physical harm, bodily injury, assault, or the threat 
of imminent physical harm, bodily injury, or assault; o r 
      (2)  An intentional or knowing course of conduct directed 
at an individual that seriously alarms or disturbs 
consistently or continually bothers the individual and 
serves no legitimate purpose; provided that such course of 
conduct would cause a reasonable person to suffer emotional 
distress.  
(b)  The district courts shall have the power to enjoin, 
prohibit, or temporarily restrain harassment.  
(c)  Any person who has been subjected to harassment may 
petition the district court of the district in which the 
petitioner resides for a temporary restraining order and an 
injunction from further harassment.  
     . . . . 
(f)
  Upon petition to a district court under this section, 
the court may temporarily restrain the person or persons 
named in the petition fro
m harassing the petitioner upon a 
determination that there is probable cause to believe that 
a past act or acts of harassment have occurred or that a 
threat or threats of harassment may be imminent.   The court 
may issue an ex parte temporary restraining order either in 
writing or orally; provided that oral orders shall be 
reduced to writing by the close of the next court day 
following oral issuance.  
(g)  A temporary restraining order that is granted under 
this section shall remain in effect at the discretio
n of 
the court for a period not to exceed ninety days from the 
date the order is granted.   A hearing on the petition to 
enjoin harassment shall be held within fifteen days after 
the temporary restraining order is granted.  
 If service of 
the temporary restraining order has not been effected 
before the date of the hearing on the petition to enjoin, ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 4 Bascos against them occurring from 2012 to 2020.  The 
allegations included physical violence, cursing, racially 
discriminatory an
d physically threatening language, and refusal 
to leave the Meyers’ premises.  
 On June 1, 2020, the district court3 granted an ex parte TRO 
for fifteen days “unless extended or terminated by the Court.”   
 The district court schedules harassment petition hearings 
during a three-hour block every Monday morning.  The hearings 
for this case spanned six separate dates because of the district 
court’s scheduling constraints and the case’s contested nature.4  
                                                 
the court may set a new date for the hearing; provided that 
the new date shall not exceed ninety days from the date the 
temporary restraining order was granted.  
     The parties named in the petition may file or give 
oral responses explaining, excusing, justifying, or denying 
the alleged act or acts of harassment.   The court shall 
receive all evidence that is relevant at the hearing and 
may make independent inquiry.  
     If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence 
that harassment as defined in paragraph (1) of that 
definition exists, it may enjoin for no more than three 
years further harassment of the petitioner, or that 
harassment as defined in paragraph (2)  of that definition 
exists, it shall enjoin for no more than three years 
further harassment of the petitioner; provided that this 
paragraph shall not prohibit the court from issuing other 
injunctions against the named parties even if the time to 
which the injunction applies exceeds a total of three 
years. 
 . . . . 
(h)  The court may grant the prevailing party in an action 
brought under this section costs and fees, including 
attorney's fees.  
 
3  The Honorable Blaine J. Kobayashi presided.  
 
4  When Kieu Meyer testified during the first hearing, the Bascos 
conducted voir dire of various pictures and exhibits.  During the second 
hearing, the parties completed the examinations of Kieu Meyer and a second 
witness.  Throughout the next three hearings, six more witnesses testified. 
At the December 7, 2020 hearing, the court proposed having the next hearing ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 5 Hearings were held on 
June 15, July 6, August 17, September 28, 
and December 7, 2020, and on January 11, 2021.  Until the last 
hearing, the district court ordered that the TRO remain in 
effect until the next hearing.   
 2. Motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction  
 
 The Bascos did not object to the district court’s orders 
continuing the TRO.  On December 27, 2020, however, they filed a 
motion to dismiss the Meyers’ injunction petition, alleging a 
lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  The Bascos asserted that 
under HRS § 604-10.5(g), a TRO can remain in effec t only for “a 
period not to exceed ninety days from the date the order is 
granted,” and that, therefore, the TRO and the court’s 
jurisdiction over the matter  expired on August 29, 2020.   
The district court scheduled a hearing on the Bascos’ 
motion for January 11, 2021, the next scheduled hearing on the 
Meyers’ injunction petition.  Before the hearing, the
 Meyers 
filed a memorandum in opposition.  They noted the Bascos had not 
objected to any of the orders continuing the TRO.  They also 
argued HRS § 604-10.5 should be construed to ensure petitioners 
have the benefit of an order prohibiting harassment pending 
completion of the hearing.5   
                                                 
in two weeks.  The Meyers asked to continue it until January to “enjoy our 
holidays” and the Bascos agreed.  
 
5  The Meyers also argued that Chief Justice Mark E. Recktenwald 
authorized each presiding judge to postpone matters to ensure health and ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 6  3.  Orders g ranting i njunction a gainst harassment  
 and awarding attorney fees and costs  
 
At the January 11, 2021 hearing, the district court denied 
the Bascos’ motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.  The 
district court concluded it was not divested of jurisdiction 
just because more than ninety days had elapsed since the initial 
granting of the TRO.  The court pointed out that, if that was 
the case, a respondent could drag out an injunction hearing for 
more than ninety 
days.  The court also determined it had 
inherent authority to continue the TRO in place and protect 
petitioners pending a final decision.  It opined that this 
comported with the purpose and intent of HRS § 604- 10.5 to 
restrain acts of harassment until the injunction hearing was 
concluded.   
The district court then found that the Meyers proved the 
allegations of the petition by clear and convincing evidence and 
granted a three-year injunction order.  On February 8, 2021, the 
court approved the Meyers’ HRS § 604-10.5(h) motion for attorney 
fees and costs in full, and ordered the Bascos to pay attorney 
fees of $21,252.00 and costs of $1,108.44.   
 
 
                                                 
safety during the COVID -19 pandemic.  This was not a basis for the ICA’s 
ruling and is not raised on certiorari.  Hence, arguments and rulings 
regarding COVID- 19 orders  will not be further discusse d. ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 7 B.  ICA proceedings  
 The Bascos appealed, repeating arguments they made to the 
district court.  In summary, they argued that because the TRO 
was granted on June 1, 2020, it was only valid until August 29, 
2020 pursuant to HRS § 604- 10.5(g) and that the district court 
therefore lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enter the 
injunction and attorney fees orders.  They also cited to Ling v. 
Yokoyama, 91 Hawai ʻi 131, 980 P.2d 1005 (App. 1999), which is 
discussed below. 
In a September 20, 2022 memorandum opinion, the ICA 
affirmed the district court.  Meyer v. Basco, CAAP-21-0000027 
(App. Sept. 20, 2022) (mem. op.).  The ICA pointed out that the 
purpose of the TRO is to protect against imminent harm by 
providing a period of separation while the district court hears 
from the parties and decides whether to grant a petition to 
enjoin harassment.  Id.  at 6 (citing Hamilton  ex rel. Lethem v. 
Lethem, 126 Hawai ʻi 294, 305, 270 P.3d 1024, 1035 (2012)).   The 
ICA concluded the district court’s jurisdiction over a petition 
to enjoin harassment does not hinge on the status of the TRO and 
that the district court therefore had jurisdiction over the 
injunction petition and motion for attorney fees and costs.   
Meyer, mem. op. at 7.  
 The ICA did not decide whether the TRO had actually 
expired on August 29, 2020, as alleged by the Bascos.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 8 Meyer, mem. op. at 2 n.2.  The ICA stated in footnote 2 
that because the Bascos had not challenged the TRO 
extensions except to the extent it affected the district 
court’s jurisdiction , it need not address whether the TRO  
expired after ninety days .  Id. 
 On November 1, 2022, the ICA approved in full the 
Meyers’ request for appellate attorney fees of $16,187.14. 
On November 1, 2022, the ICA filed its judgment on appeal.   
C. Certiorari proceedings 
 
  
In essence, the Bascos ’ January 3, 2023 certiorari 
application argues the ICA erred by disregarding the plain and 
unambiguous language of HRS 
§ 604-10.5(g) that a TRO “shall 
remain in effect at the discretion of the court for a period not 
to exceed ninety days from the date the order is granted [.]”  
III. Standards of Review 
 
A. Subject matter j urisdiction  
 
  “The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law that 
we review de novo under the right/wrong standard.”  Lingle v.

to be reviewed de novo  under the right/wrong standard.”   Lingle,

 9 IV. Discussion
 
 
A. The ICA did not err by ruling the district court was not 
divested of jurisdiction to rule on the injunction petition 
just because more than ninety days had elapsed from the 
original TRO issuance  
 
The Bascos continue to assert the district court was 
without subject matter jurisdiction to address the injunction 
petition on the ninety- first day after the issuance of the TRO 
because of the language of HRS § 604- 10.5(g), which says “[a] 
temporary restraining order that is granted under this section 
shall remain in effect at the discretion of the court for a 
period not to exceed ninety days from the date the order is 
granted
[.]”     
 The ICA did not err by holding otherwise.  The statute 
contains no language saying a district court must decide an 
injunction petition within ninety days of issuance of an ex 
parte TRO against harassment.  And as the ICA noted, the statute 
also does not say a district court loses jurisdiction over an 
injunction petition when ninety- days elapses from ex parte TRO 
issuance.  Further, HR S § 604-7(e) (2016) provides the district 
courts with “power to . . .  make . . . orders . . . and do such 
other acts and take such other steps as may be necessary to 
carry into full effect the powers which are . . . given them by 
law or for the promotion of justice in matters pending before 
them.”  The district courts have been empowered to rule on ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 10 injunction petitions under HRS § 604- 10.5, and they must have 
reasonable discretion in the scheduling of hearings.  It would 
be absurd to construe HRS § 604-10.5(g) as meaning a district 
court loses jurisdiction if the injunction petition is not 
decided within ninety days of the ex parte TRO issuance.  As the 
district court reasoned, a respondent could then intentionally 
drag out an injunction hearing until ninet
y days had elapsed.   
 Moreover, as explained in Section IV.B below, district 
courts in any event have jurisdiction and discretion to continue 
TROs past ninety days.   
 For all of these reasons, the ICA did not err by holding 
that the district court was not divested of jurisdiction to rule 
on the injunction petition just because more than ninety days 
had elapsed from the original TRO issuance.  
B. If a district court has commenced hearing the merits of an 
HRS § 604 -10.5 injunction petition but, despite reasonable 
efforts, is unable to conclude the hearing within ninety 
days of issuance of the ex parte TRO, it has jurisdiction 
and discretion to continue the TRO pending its final 
decision on the injunction petition as long as standards 
for issuance of temporary injunctive relief are met 
   
 In this case, an ex parte TRO was issued on June 1, 2020.  
Ninety days elapsed on August 29, 2020.  Because of the hotly 
contested nature of the petition and the district court’s 
scheduling constraints, hearings on the injunction petition took 
place on six separate dates over a seven- month period.  Three of 
those hearings were after August 29, 2020.  Each time the ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 11     hearings were continued, the district court ordered that the TRO 
remain in place.   
 The ICA explicitly indicated it was not deciding whether 
the TRO had expired after ninety days because it was not 
required to do so.  In other words, whether or not the TRO had 
expired, the district court still had jurisdiction to decide the 
injunction petition.  The Bascos’ jurisdi ction argument is, 
however, premised on an assumption that an HRS § 604-10.5(g) TRO 
can never continue past ninety days.  Therefore, if the 
assumption fails, the Bascos’ entire argument fails.   
 In addition, although the issue of whether this TRO 
remained valid beyond ninety- days is moot, the question of 
whether an HRS § 604- 10.5 TRO can be extended past ninety days 
has significant public safety and public interest implications.  
If the question remains unanswered, respondents might believe 
they can resume contact and engage in actions that could 
constitute harassment.  Also, uncertainty regarding the issue 
affects not only the parties, but also the actions of the 
judiciary and law enforcement.6  Therefore, we address the 
                                                 
6  Without a definitive answer, district court judges could rule 
differently on the issue.  Law enforcement would not know whether contact 
after ninety days constitutes a criminal offense . ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 12  question of whether an HRS § 604- 10.5 TRO can be extended past 
ninety days.7   
 Our interpretation 
of HRS § 604- 10.5 is shaped by the 
following rules: 
First, the fundamental starting point for statutory 
interpretation is the language of the statute itself.  
Second, where the statutory language is plain and 
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain 
and obvious meaning.  Third, implicit in the task of 
statutory construction is our foremost obligation to 
ascertain and give effect to the intention of the 
legislature, which i s to be obtained primarily from the 
language contained in the statute itself.  Fourth, when 
there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness 
or uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, an 
ambiguity exists.  
 
When there is ambiguity in a st atute, “the meaning of the 
ambiguous words may be sought by examining the context, 
with which the ambiguous words, phrases, and sentences may 
be compared, in order to ascertain their true meaning.”  
Moreover, the courts may resort to extrinsic aids in 
determining legislative intent, such as legislative 
history, or the reason and spirit of the law.  
 
State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai‘i 383, 390, 219 P.3d 1170, 1177 
(2009) (cleaned up).  
 Thus, the fundamental starting point is the language of HRS 
§ 604-10.5(g) itself, which provides:  
(g)  A temporary restraining order that is granted under 
this section shall remain in effect at the discretion of 
the court for a period not to exceed ninety days from the 
date the order is granted . . . . A hearing on the petition 
to enjoin harassment shall be held within fifteen days 
after the temporary restraining order is granted.   If 
service of the temporary restraining order has not been 
                                                 
7  The public interest exception to the mootness doctrine applies when the 
question involved affects the public interest, and it is likely that similar 
questions arising in the future would likewise become moot before a needed 
authoritative determination by a n appellate court can be made .  Cmty. Ass’ns 
of Hualalai, Inc. v. Leeward Plan. Comm'n, 150 Hawai‘ i 241, 253  n.18, 500 P.3d 
426, 438 n.18 (2021). ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 13 effected before the date of the hearing on the petition to 
enjoin, the court may set a new date for the hearing; 
provided that the new date shall not exceed ninety days 
from the date the temporary restraining order was granted.  
 . . . . 
     If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence 
that harassment as defined in paragraph (1) of that 
definition exists, it may enjoin for no more than three 
years further harassment of the petitioner, or that 
harassment as defined in paragraph (2) of that definition 
exists, it shall enjoin for no more than three years 
further harassment of the petitioner  . . .; provided that 
this subsection  shall not prohibit the court from issuing 
other injunctions against the named parties even if the 
time to which the injunction applies exceeds a total of 
three years . 
 
(Emphases added.)  
 The Bascos argue that because of the first sentence of HRS 
§ 604-10.5(g), underlined above, the TRO could not continue past 
ninety days (and that the district court was therefore also 
divested of jurisdiction to rule on the injunction petition).  
The plain language of HRS § 604 -10.5(g) in dicates otherwise.  
 First, the “temporary restraining order that is granted 
under this section” refers to the ex parte8 TRO issued pursuant 
to HRS § 604-10.5(f).9  A temporary restraining order is designed 
to preserve the status quo until there is an oppor tunity to hold 
a hearing on the application for a preliminary injunction .  
Wahba, LLC v. USRP (Don), LLC , 106 Hawai ʻi 466, 472, 106 P.3d 
1109, 1115 (2005).  “P reliminary injunction ” refers to an 
interlocutory injunction issued after notice and a hearing, 
                                                 
8  Black’s Law Dictionary  (11th ed. 2019)  defines “ex parte” as “[d]one or 
made at the instance and for the benefit of one part only, and without notice 
to, or argument by, anyone having an adverse interest.”  
 
9  See supra note 2 for the text of HRS § 604 -10.5(f). ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 14 which restrains a party pending trial on the merits .  County of 
Johnston v. City of Wilson , 136 N.C. App. 775, 780 (2000).  
  Thus, once a hearing on the merits of an injunction 
petition has begun, a continued TRO is no longer one that has 
been issued ex parte , and is not equivalent to the “temporary 
restraining ordered that [has been] granted” under HRS § 604 -
10.5(f).  Rather, when a district court begins hearing the 
merits of an injunction petition but continues a TRO, it is 
actually issuing temporary in junctive relief in the nature of a 
preliminary injunction.  See Office of Hawaiian Affairs v. 
Housing and Comm. Dev. Corp. of Hawai ‘i, 117 Hawai ʻi 174, 211, 
177 P.3d 884, 921 (2008) (rev’d & remanded on other grounds by 
Hawaiʻi v. Office of Hawaiian Affair s, 556 U.S. 163 (2009))(“ OHA 
v. HCDCH”).  
 HRS § 604 -10.5(g) then expressly provides that despite its 
language limiting a permanent injunction to a maximum of three 
years, district courts are not prohibited “ from issuing other 
injunctions against the named parties even if the time to which 
the injunction applies exceeds a total of three years.”10   
 Hence, the plain language of HRS § 604- 10.5 permits 
district courts to enter ex  parte TROs pursuant to subsection 
                                                 
10  This language has existed in HRS § 604 -10.5 since its passage in 1986.  
The legislative history does not indicate what the legislature meant by this 
language, but its plain language permits a district court to issue injunctive 
relief exceeding three years.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 15 (f), but subsection (g) then provides district courts with 
discretion to issue additional injunctions exceeding the three-
year maximum allowed for permanent injunctions.  
 This plain language interpretation is supported by the 1999 
amendment to HRS § 604- 10.5 as well as an ICA opinion.  
 In 1999, HRS § 604 -10.5 was amended to allow TROs to extend 
to ninety days from the original language limiting duration to 
fifteen days.  The Senate Judiciary Committee in Standing 
Committee Report 1492 on HB 177 then state d in relevant part:  
The purpose of this bill, as received by your Committee, is 
to: 
. . . . 
(2) Extend the maximum duration for a temporary restraining 
order to ninety -days; 
. . . . 
Your Committee finds that these proposed changes to section 
604-10.5, Hawa iʻi Revised Statutes, are designed to conform  
temporary restraining orders in District Court harassment 
cases with Family Court harassment injunction procedures 
and standards.  
 
Your Committee recognizes that the fifteen day duration of 
a temporary restraining order may be inadequate when 
serving a  respondent who does not wish to be found, and 
that the petitioner must return to court to obtain a 
continuance every time the  temporary restraining order 
expires.  However, your Committee is concerned that  an ex 
parte allegation of harassment should not remain 
outstanding for a lengthy period without affording the 
respondent an opportunity to be heard.  Therefore, it is 
your Committee’s intent that the District Court schedule 
hearing dates that would enable  the respondent to be heard 
within fifteen days of the date of service of the temporary 
restraining order.  
 
(Emphasis added.) 
 This shows the 1999 amendment was intended to not allow an  
ex parte TRO  to continue past fifteen days of service without a 
hearing.  Thus, the legislature recognized the difference ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 16 between ex parte TROs and “injunctions” other than the three -
year injunction.    
 The plain language interpretation and the intent of the 
legislature’s 1999 amendment is supported by the ICA opinion i n 
Ling, 91 Hawaiʻ i 131, 980 P.2d 1005.11  In Ling, the district 
court granted respondent’s request to continue the injunction 
petition hearing without addressing its merits, but also 
continued the TRO until the next hearing date.  91 Hawaiʻi at 
132, 980 P.2d at 1006.  After hearing the merits, the district 
court dismissed the petition finding insufficient basis for 
issuance of an injunction.  Id.  
 The ICA held the term “shall” in the second sentence of HRS 
§ 604-10.5(g) mandates that a hearing on the injunction petition 
be held within fifteen days of the ex parte  TRO.12  91 Hawaiʻi at 
                                                 
11  The ICA filed its opinion  on June 28, 1999.  Under the version of HRS § 
604-10.5 it addressed, a TRO was only valid for fifteen days.  HRS § 604 -
10.5(e) (1993).  However, an amendment allowing the initial TRO to extend to 
ninety days took effect on July 1, 1999.  1999 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 143, § 1 
at 460-61; S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1492, in 1999 Senate Journal, at 1599 -
1600; H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 733, in 1999 House Journal, at 1306 -07; Conf. 
Comm. Rep. No. 86, in 1999 House Journal, at 948,  Senate Journal, at 878.   
 
 
12  At the time of the case, HRS § 604 -10.5(f) (Supp.  1998) read:  
 
(f) A hearing on the petition to enjoin harassment shall be 
held within fifteen days after it is filed.  The parties 
named in the petition  may file responses explaining, 
excusing, justifying, or denying the alleged act or acts of 
harassment.   The court shall receive such evidence as is 
relevant at the hearing, and may make independent inquiry.  
 
If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence  that 
harassment as defined in paragraph (1) of that definition 
exists, it may enjoin for no more than three years further ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 17  133-34, 980 P.2d at 1007-08.  The ICA determined that the term 
“held” required the parties “at the least, convene or meet in a 
hearing on the merits within the allotted time.”  91 Hawai ʻi at 
134, 980 P.2d at 1008.  The ICA held the district court erred in 
granting the continuance beyond fifteen days only because no 
hearing on the merits of the petition was held  within fifteen 
days; the initial hearing dealt with only continuing the 
hearing, not the merits of the parties’ arguments.  Id. 
 The ICA also noted, however, that “[t]here may be 
exceptional circumstances under which a court may be compelled 
to order a continuance, but as we point out  infra, any 
conceivable prejudice would ordinarily be cured by extending the 
initial temporary restraining order.”   91 Hawai ʻi at 135 n.4, 980 
P.2d at 1009 n.4.  The ICA ultimately held the district court’s 
error had no bearing on the court’s dismissal of the petition:   
[W]hatever prejudice might have been incurred by Petitioner 
as a result of the continuance was dissipated by the 
extension of the T
RO to the completion of the hearing[.]  
The effect of the  extension was to maintain the court’s 
initial order against harassment until the case was 
decided.  Although the continuance was in technical 
violation of the mandate in HRS § 604 -10.5(f), the 
protection intended to be afforded a petition until a 
resolution of th e petition remained intact.  
 
                                                 
harassment of the petitioner, or that harassment as defined 
in paragraph (2) of that definition exists, it shall enjoin 
for no more t han three years further harassment of the 
petitioner; provided that this paragraph shall not prohibit 
the court from issuing other injunctions against the named 
parties even if the time to which the injunction applies 
exceeds a total of three years.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 18 91 Hawaiʻ i at 135, 980 P.2d at 1009.   
 Thus, in Ling, the ICA held that a hearing on the merits of 
an injunction petition must commence within fifteen days of 
service of the ex parte TRO on the respondent,13 but that when  
hearings on the merits begin, a TRO can be extended beyond the 
statutory maximum for an ex  parte TRO.  91 Hawai ʻi at 13
4-35, 980 
P.2d at 1008-09.   Once the merit hearing begins, the TRO is 
actually no longer ex  parte. 
 Synthesizing the above, we hold that if a district court 
has commenced hearing the merits of an HRS § 604 -10.5 injunction 
petition but, despite reasonable efforts, it is unable to 
conclude the hearing within ninety days of issuance of the ex 
parte TRO, it has jurisdiction and discretion to continue the 
TRO pending its final decision on the injunction petition, if 
standards for issuance of temporary injunctive relief are met .  
In other words, the continued TRO is no longer ex parte.  
 With respect to the standards for temporary injunctive 
relief, we have held: 
 The test for granting or denying temporary injunctive 
relief is three -fold: (1) whether the plaintiff is likely 
to prevail on t he merits; (2) whether the balance of 
irreparable damage favors the issuance of a temporary 
injunction; and (3) whether the public interest supports 
granting an injunction.   However,  . . . the more the 
                                                 
13  HRS § 604- 10.5(g) requires that a hearing on the merits of an 
injunction petition be “held” within 15 days of the issuance of the ex parte 
TRO.  In Ling, however, the ICA recognized the validity of the TRO extension 
despite the lack of a merits hearing within 15 days.  91 Hawaiʻ i at 135, 980 
P.2d at 1009.   District courts should, however, begin hearing the merits of 
an injunction petition within 15 days of service of the 
ex parte TRO.   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

balance of irreparable damage favors issuance of the 
injunction, the less the party seeking the injunction has 
to show the likelihood of his success on the 
merits. . . .[T] he standard for a preliminary injunction is 
essentially the same as for a permanent injunction with the 
exception that the plaintiff must show a likelihood of 
success on the merits rather than actual success.  
 
OHA v. HCDCH, 117 Hawai ʻi at 211- 12, 177 P.3d at 921- 22 (cleaned 
up).  Hence, district courts should apply these standards in 
deciding whether to continue an HRS § 604- 10.5 TRO past ninety 
days.   
C. Attorney fees and costs 
 
 Finally, on certiorari, the Bascos also challenge the 
district court and ICA awards of attorney fees and costs, but 
solely on jurisdictional grounds.  No challenge is made as to 
the reasonableness of the awards. 
 As the district court had 
jurisdiction and the ICA had appellate jurisdiction, we affirm 
those awards.  
V. Conclusion 
 
 For these reasons, we affirm the ICA’s November 1, 2022 
judgment on appeal, subject to the clarifications in this 
opinion.
