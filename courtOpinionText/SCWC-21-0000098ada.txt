I.  Introduction 
 
 This is a statutory interpretation case.  We are called 
upon to interpret Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (“HRS”) § 831 -3.2(a) 
(2014 & Supp. 2018), which allows for expungement of arrest 
records.  It provides in relevant part:  Electronically Filed

 § 831-3.2.  Expungement orders    
(a)  The . . . attorney general ’s duly authorized 
representative  . . . , upon written application from a 
person arrested for, or charged with but not convicted of a 
crime, . . . shall issue an expungement order annulling, 
canceling, and rescinding the record of arrest; provided 
that an expungement order shall not be issued:  
       . . . . 
(2)  For a period of five years after arrest or 
citation in the case of a petty misdemeanor or 
violation where conviction has not been obtained 
because of a bail forfeiture[.]  
 
 Phillip J. Barker (“Barker”) was arrested for harassment, a 
petty misdemeanor.  He was eventually convicted of disorderly 
conduct as a violation.  He then applied to the Hawaiʻi Criminal 
Justice Data Center (“HCJDC”) for expungement of his arrest 
record pursuant to HRS § 831-3.2.  He asserted that because HRS 
§ 701-107(7) (2014) of the Hawaiʻ i Penal Code provides that a 
violation does not constitute a crime, he is entitled to 
expungement based on the plain language of HRS § 831-3.2(a).   
 The HCJDC  denied his application, concluding that Barker 
had been convicted of a “crime” wi thin the meaning of HRS § 831-
3.2(a), pointing to HRS § 831 -3.2(a)(2), which provides that an 
expungement order shall not  issue for five years after arrest 
“in the case of a petty misdemeanor or violation  where 
conviction has not been obtained because of a bail 
forfeiture[.]”  
 Barker then sought an order from the Circuit Court of the 
First Circuit (“circuit court”) to require the HCJDC to expunge ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
3 
 his arrest record.  The circuit court1 granted judgment in favor 
of the HCJDC.  
 Barker appealed to the Interme
diate Court of Appeals 
(“ICA”), which affirmed the circuit court in a published 
opinion.  See Barker v. Young, 151 Hawai ʻi 312, 511 P.3d 811 
(App. 2022).  The ICA ruled it could not apply the Penal Code 
definition of crime to HRS § 831- 3.2(a) because of the language 
in subsection (a)(2).   151 Hawaiʻi at 320, 511 P.3d at 819.  
Essentially, the HCJDC, circuit court, and ICA all concluded 
that inclusion of the word “violation” in HRS § 831 -3.2(a)(2) 
indicates a “violation” is a “crime” under HRS § 831 -3.2(a).  
 On certiorari, Barker asks “[w]hether the ICA gravely erred 
in holding that the word ‘crime’ in [HRS § 831-3.2(a)] is 
ambiguous such that the word includes violations? ”  
 Applying rules of statutory interpretation, we hold 
that 
under the plain language of HRS §§ 831-3.2(a) and 701- 107(7), a 
person arrested for or charged with a crime (including a petty 
misdemeanor), but convicted of a violation, is eligible for 
arrest record expungement because a “violation” is not a 
“crime.”2  
                         
1  The Honorable Bert I. Ayabe presided.  
 
2  The statute allows expungement only of arrest records; conviction 
records are not at issue.  
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

  We therefore vacate the ci rcuit court’s order granting the 
HCJDC’s motion for summary judgment  and its final judgment, as 
well as the ICA’s judgment on appeal, and we remand to the 
circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this 
opinion.     
II.  Background 
 
A. HCJDC pro ceedings 
 
 On October 7, 2017, Barker was arrested for harassment in 
violation of HRS § 711- 1106(1)(a)  (2014), a petty misdemeanor.3  
On November 21, 2017, Barker pled no contest and was found 
guilty of the amended charge of d isorderly c onduct under HRS § 
711-1101(1)(b) (2014), a s a violation.4  
                         
3  HRS § 711- 1106(1)(a) & (2) provide:  
 
  (1)  A person commits the offense of harassment if, with intent  
  to harass, annoy, or alarm any other person, that person:  
 
       (a)  Strikes, shoves, kicks, or otherwise touches another  
 person in an offensive manner or subjects the other   
 person to offensive physical contact[.] 
  . . . . 
 (2)  Harassment is a petty misdemeanor . 
  
4  HRS § 711- 1101(1)(b) & (3) provide:  
 
(1)  A person commits the offense of disorderly conduct if, with 
intent to cause physical inconvenience or alarm by a member or 
members of the public, or recklessly creating a risk  thereof, the 
person: 
. . . . 
 (b)  Makes unreasonable noise . . .  . 
. . . . 
(3)  Disorderly conduct is a petty misdemeanor if it is the 
defendant’s intention to cause substantial harm or serious  
inconvenience, or if the defendant persists in disorderly  conduct 
after reasonable warning or request to desist.  Otherwise 
disorderly conduct is a violation.

  On June 20, 2019, Barker submitted an application to the 
HCJDC to have his h arassment arrest record expunged pursuant to 
HRS § 831-3.2 .  Barker asserted that because he was found guilty 
of a “violation ” and not a “crime,” he is eligible for 
expungement.  The HCJDC denied Barker’s application on the basis 
that arrests result
ing in convictions , even for violations, do 
not qualify for expungement.   
B. Circuit court proceedings 
 On October 19, 2020, Barker filed a 
first amended c omplaint 
in circuit court.   Barker argued that under HRS § 701- 107(5),5 a 
violation does not constitute a crime, and therefore, Barker was 
“not convicted of a crime” within the meaning of the expungement 
statute.  Barker requested an order requiring the HCJDC to 
expunge his record of arrest, or alternatively, a declaratory 
judgment that he is entitled to have his 
arrest record expunged.   
 
Barker and the HCJDC then filed cross- motions for s ummary 
judgment.  Barker argued that the only relevant definitions of 
                         
5  HRS § 701- 107 provides  in relevant part:  
 
(1)  An offense defined by this Code or by any other statute of 
this State for which a sentence of imprisonment is authorized 
constitutes a crime.  Crimes are of three grades:  felonies, 
misdemeanors, and petty misdemeanors.  . . . 
 . . . . 
 (5)  An offense defined by this Code or by any other statute of 
 this State constitutes a violation if it is so designated in  this 
 Code or in the law defining the offense or if no other sentence 
 than a fine, or fine and forfeiture or other civil penalty, is 
 authorized upon conviction or if it is defined by a statute other 
 than this Code which provides that the offense shall not 
 constitute a crime.  A violation does not constitute a crime, and 
 conviction of a violation shall not give rise to any civil 
 disability based on conviction of a criminal offense.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
6 
 “crime” and “violation” are found in HRS § 701 -107 of the Hawaiʻi 
Penal Code, which explicitly provides that “[a] violation does 
not constitute a crime, and conviction of a violation shall not 
give rise to any  civil disability based on conviction of a 
criminal offense.”  Barker asserted that the legislature could 
have used the word “offense” in HRS § 831 -3.2(a), which would 
have included violations, but it did not.    
 HCJDC argued that the definitions of “violation ” and 
“crime” in HRS § 701- 107 are inapplicable to the expungement 
statute.  The HCJDC maintained that the legislative history of 
the expungement statute indicates an intent to “minimize or 
abolish extrajudicial penalties which may confront a person who 
has a record of arrest, even though such arrest did not lead to 
conviction.”  HCJDC noted that Barker’s arrest for harassment 
did lead to his conviction of  a violation.    
 The HCJDC also relied on HRS § 831- 3.2(a)(2) , which 
provides that an expungement order shall not be issued  “[f]or a 
period of five years after arrest or citation in the case of a 
petty misdemeanor or violation where conviction has not been 
obtained because of a bail forfeiture[ .]”  HCJDC posited that  if 
the legislature had intended “violation” and “crime” to be 
defined as in the Hawaiʻi Penal Code, “it would follow that a 
record of arrest or citation for a violation would always 
qualify to be expunged regardless of whether the arrest or ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
7 
 citation led to a conviction.”  HCJDC asserted it would be 
illogical to require it to  maintain records of violations if 
they would subsequently be expunged irrespective of later 
convictions.  Finally,  citing Crime, Black’s Law Dictionary  
(11th ed. 2019) , the HCJDC  contended the term “crime” in § 831-
3.2 should be interpreted according to i ts common legal 
definition, which is an “act that the law makes punishable [.]”  
 The circuit court agreed with the HCJDC.  It entered an 
order denying Barker’s motion and granting  HCJDC’s motion  on 
March 1, 2021.  It also entered its judgment on that day.  
C. ICA proceedings 
 On March 3, 2021, Barker appealed  to the ICA.  The parties’ 
briefs repeated arguments made in the circuit court.  In a 
published opinion, the ICA affirmed the circuit court.   See 
Barker, 151 Hawaiʻi 312, 511 P.3d 811.  The ICA concluded the 
term “crime” in HRS § 831 -3.2(a) is ambiguous.  151 Hawai ʻi at 
317-18, 511 P.3d at 816-17.  The ICA ruled that it could not 
apply the Penal Code definition of crime to HRS § 831-3.2 
because of the language in subsection (a)(2) delaying 
expungement eligibility for a “violation where conviction has 
not been obtained because of a bail forfeiture[ .]”  151 Hawai ʻi 
at 318, 511 P.3d at 817 (quoting HRS § 831-3.2(a)(2)).  The ICA 
also construed the intent of the expungement law as to allow 
expungements only w hen there was no conviction.  151 Hawai ʻi at ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
8 
 318-20, 511 P.3d at 817-19  (citing Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 21, in 
1975 Senate Journal, at 859; Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 18, in 1975 
House Journal, at 885).  The ICA concluded that interpreting the 
term “crime” in HRS §  831-3.2(a) to include violations is 
rational, reasonable, and consistent with legislative intent.  
151 Hawai
ʻi at 320, 511 P.3d at 819 (“A ‘rational, sensible[,] 
and practicable interpretation of a statute is preferred to one 
which is unreasonable or impracticable . . . .’ ” (quoting In re 
Doe, 90 Hawaiʻ i 246, 251, 978 P.2d 684, 689 (1999)) ).  Hence, the 
ICA held that because Barker’s harassment arrest resulted in a 
conviction for a violation, Barker does  not meet the statutory 
expungement criteria.   151 Hawaiʻ i at 320-21, 511 P.3d at 819- 20 
(citing HRS § 831-3.2(a)) .   
D. Certiorari proceedings 
 Barker ’s July 8,  2022 application presents one question: 
whether the ICA gravely erred in holding that the word “crime” 
in HRS § 831-3.2(a) is ambiguous such that the word includes 
violations?   
 
In addition to his previous arguments, Barker notes the 
principle of statutory interpretation that “where the statutory 
language is plain and unambiguous, [a court’s] sole duty is to 
give effect [t]o its plain and obvious me aning.”  Barker further 
argues that “[w]here there is no ambiguity in the language of a 
statute, and the literal application of the language would not ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
9 
 produce an absurd or unjust result . . . there is no room for 
judicial construction[.]”   
 Barker  also points out that it is only the record of arrest 
that he seeks to expunge, not the conviction.  He argues that 
there is no ambiguity in the  statute and that if the legislature 
meant “crime” to mean “offense ,” which includes crimes and 
violations,6 then it would have used the word “offense” instead 
of “crime” in HRS § 831 -3.2(a).  Barker points out that the 
statute has been amended eight times without the word “crime” 
being changed to “offense .”   
 Barker questions the logic of t he ICA’s reasoning that 
“crime” must include “violations” because HRS § 831 -3.2(a)(2) 
provides an exception for expungement in the case of violations 
when there is bail forfeiture.7  
III.  Standard of Review  
 “Statutory interpretation is a question of law reviewable 
de novo.”  State v. W heeler, 121 Hawai ʻi 383, 390, 219 P.3d 1170, 
1177 (2009) (cleaned up ). 
 Our interpretation is shaped by the following rules: 
First, the fundamental starting point for statutory 
interpretation is the language of the statute itself.  
Second, where the statutory language is p lain and 
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain 
and obvious meaning.  Third, implicit in the task of 
                         
6  HRS § 701- 102(1) (2014) provides, “No behavior constitutes an offen se 
unless it is a crime or violation under this Code or another statute of this 
State.”   
 
7  The HCJDC did not file a response to Barker’s application.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
10 
 statutory construction is our foremost obligation to 
ascertain and give effect to the intention of the 
legislature, which is to be obtai ned primarily from the 
language contained in the statute itself.  Fourth, when 
there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness 
or uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, an 
ambiguity exists.  
 
When there is ambiguity in a statute, “the m eaning of the 
ambiguous words may be sought by examining the context, 
with which the ambiguous words, phrases, and sentences may 
be compared, in order to ascertain their true meaning.”  
Moreover, the courts may resort to extrinsic aids in 
determining legis lative intent, such as legislative 
history, or the reason and spirit of the law.  
 
Id. (cleaned up).  
IV.  Discussion 
 Whether Barker’s arrest record is eligible for expungement 
is governed by HRS § 831-3.2, which provides  in relevant part: 
§ 831-3.2.  Expungement orders   
(a)  The . . . attorney general ’s duly authorized 
representative  . . . , upon written application from a 
person arrested for, or charged with but not convicted of a 
crime, . . . shall issue an expungement order annulling, 
canceling, and rescinding the record of arrest; provided 
that an expungement order shall not be issued:  
       . . . . 
(2) 
 For a period of five years after arrest or 
citation in the case of a petty misdemeanor or 
violation where conviction has not been obtained 
because of a bail forfeiture[.]  
 
  As noted in Section III above, statutory interpretation 
begins with the premise that when statutory language is plain 
and unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain 
and obvious meaning.   See Wheeler, 121 Hawaiʻi at 390, 219 P.3d 
at 1177. 
 HRS § 831 -3.2(a) provides that a person arrested for  but 
not convicted of a crime is eligible for an arrest record 
expungement.  Barker was charged with harassment, a petty ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
11 
 misdemeanor.  He was convicted of disorderly conduct as a 
violation.  Under HRS § 701- 107, a petty misdemeanor is a crime,  
but a violation is not.  Barker was therefore “charged with but 
not convicted of a crime[ .]”  See HRS § 831-3.2(a).  Hence, he 
is eligible for expungement of his arrest record.  
  The exception in HRS § 831 -3.2(a)(2) does not create an 
ambiguity as to the plain language  of HRS § 831 -3.2(a).  HRS § 
831-3.2(a)(2) provides that if there is no conviction on a petty 
misdemeanor or violation charge because of a bail forfeiture 
(non-appearance in court), an expungement order cannot issue 
until five years from the date of arrest or citation.  State v. 
Vallesteros, 84 Hawai ʻi 295, 933 P.2d 632 (1997),  held that 
police officers “ may arrest those who commit violations, not 
just crimes, in the officers’ presence[,]” “but only insofar as 
the offense is not a traffic
-related violation.”   84 Hawaiʻi at 
301, 933 P.2d at 638.  But pursuant to HRS § 831- 3.2(a), if 
there is a conviction on a charged violation, an arrest record 
based on that conviction is still eligible for expungement. 
 The rules of statutory interpretation require us to apply a 
plain language analysis when statutory language is clear.  Only 
when there is an ambiguity in a statute are we to resort to 
other methods of statutory interpretation.  As we said in State 
v. Obrero, 151 Hawai ʻi 472, 517 P.3d 755 (2022): ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
12 
 The in pari materia canon of statutory interpretation is a 
useful tool for interpreting ambiguous or doubtful 
statutes.  But it should not be used to muddle the meaning 
of unequivocal, but inconvenient, black letter law.  Our 
rule is “What is clear in one statute may be called upon in 
aid to explain what is doubtful  in another.”  It is not: 
“What is clear in one statute may be called upon to create 
doubt in another.”  
 
151 Hawaiʻ i at 479, 517 P.3d at 762 (cleaned up). 
  
 Hence, w hat is clear in HRS § 831- 3.2(a)(2) may not be 
called upon to create doubt in HRS § 831- 3.2(a).  Only “when 
there is ambiguity in a statute,” then, “the meaning of the 
ambiguous words may be sought by” applying other methods of 
statutory interpretation, su ch as the in pari materia  canon, or 
by “resort[ing] to extrinsic aids in determining legislative 
intent, such as legislative history, or the reason and spirit of 
the law.”  Wheeler, 121 Hawai‘ i at 390, 219 P.3d at 1177 (cleaned 
up).  HRS § 831-3.2(a)(2) is equally clear.  It provides that if 
there is no conviction on a petty misdemeanor or violation 
charge because of a bail forfeiture (non -appearance in court), 
an expungement order cannot issue until five years from the date 
of arrest or citation.   
 Finally , we appreciate the concern expressed by the HCJDC 
that interpreting the term “crime” in HRS § 831 -3.2(a) as 
excluding “violations” would seemingly preclude a person 
arrested for and then convicted of a violation from obtaining 
expungement of an arrest record.  That issue, however, is not ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
13 before us at this time.8  Today, we address the issue before us 
and hold that under the plain language of HRS §§ 831-3.2(a) and
701-107(7), a person arrested for or charged with a crime
(including a petty misdemeanor) but convicted of a violation is 
eligible for expungement because a “violation” is not a “crime.” 
V. Conclusion
Under the plain language of HRS §§ 831- 3.2(a) and 701-
107(7), a person arrested for or charged with a crime, but 
convicted of a violation, is eligible for arrest record 
expungement because a “violation” is not a “crime.”  
We therefore vacate the circu it court’s order granting the 
HCJDC’s motion for summary judgment  and its final judgment, as 
well as the ICA’s judgment on appeal, and we remand to the 
circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this 
opinion.

8If such a case were to arise, other rules of statutory interpretation 
could be triggered.  For example,  “[i]f a literal construction of statutory 
language would produce an  absurd result, we presume that result was not 
intended and construe the statute in accord with its underlying legislative 
intent.”  State v. Abella , 145 Hawaiʻ i 541, 552, 454 P.3d 482, 493 (2019)
