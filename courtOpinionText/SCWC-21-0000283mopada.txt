and Wilson, J., dissenting ) 1
 
 The Department of Human Services (DHS) and Resource 
Caregivers (RCGs) appeal from the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ 
(ICA) judgment on appeal vacating the Family Court of the First 
Circuit’s order terminating a father’s parental rights. 
The ICA found that the family court structurally erred when

 I. 
DHS petitioned for temporary foster custody of a child, JB, 
in May 2017.
  The court immediately appointed counsel for the 
child’s parents.  Father and counsel appeared at the first two 
CPA hearings.  Then Father stopped participating in the case. 
After Father failed to appear at a required hearing, the 
family court entered default against him.  Counsel, however, 
remained on the case.  Five months later, Father failed to appear at another hearing.  The court continued Father’s default 
and discharged his counsel.

In July 2019, DHS moved to terminate parental rights (TPR).  
Before filing its TPR motion, DHS notified Father of its 
intention to move to terminate his parental rights.  Father 
expressed disinterest; he refused to participate in the case.3   
Trial on DHS’s TPR motion began in February 2021.  Mother, 
who had participated throughout the CPA proceedings, appeared 
with her counsel.  But Father did not show.  He had not appeared 
 
2  The Honorable Jeffrey A. Hawk entered the default against Father on 
November 2, 2017.  The Honorable Brian A. Costa discharged Father’s counsel 
on April 17, 2018. 
 
3  Father had reported to DHS that he obtained a temporary restraining 
order (issued on June 21, 2017 and set to expire on June 21, 2020) against 
Mother and that he was concerned about his safety.  When DHS informed Father 
about the upcoming TPR motion, he said that he would not get involved in the 
case.  DHS told Father that it would try to place JB with his maternal 
grandfather; Father liked this proposed placement, preferring that JB not be 
placed with strangers.

 in family court since July 2017.  The family court continued the 
entry of default against Father.4  
 On the fifth and final day of trial, Father – after nearly four years – showed up in family court.  So did his lawyer.

Counsel asked the court to set aside Father’s default, 
postpone the trial, and give Father the opportunity to challenge 
DHS’s TPR motion.  After counsel argued to set aside the 
default, Father had an opportunity to address the court.  The court asked Father why he had failed to show up to court over 
the past several years.  Father replied: “there was 
complications in the case before” due to his hostile 
relationship with Mother.  He further explained that he was 
“trying . . . [to] let everything settle” and he was “under the 
impression that [JB’s maternal] grandfather was going [to get] 
custody” of JB. 
The court denied the motion to set aside the default and 
excused Father’s counsel.  The court explained that a few years back, it “gave . . . an extra five months or so to [Father] and 
[his counsel] to try and re-establish contact.”  It also 
observed “[t]his case has been ongoing with no input from

Andrew T. Park presided over the TPR trial. 
 
5  Father had called the family court and asked about the case.  Staff 
advised Father about the next day’s court hearing.  T he court reappointed his 
counsel. *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 father.”  The court pointed out that Father had missed over 29 
hearings between November 2017 and April 2021. 
Thus, the court concluded Father did not show good cause to 
support his motion to set aside the entry of default.  See Chen 
v. Mah, 146 Hawai‘ i 157, 457 P.3d 796 (2020).  The court 
explained that it “was well grounded in making that 
determination in denying father’s motion to set aside his 
default after his . . . [over] three years of absence in the 
case and his lack of participation in not only the case, in 
visitation, or contact with the child, contact with the 
department, or services.” 
The court granted DHS’s motion and terminated Father’s 
parental rights.  The court made the necessary findings under 
Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) § 587A-33(a) (2018).  It filed an 
order terminating parental rights and letters of permanent 
custody on April 5, 2021. 
 
Father appealed.  He argues the discharge of counsel 
constituted structural error. 
The ICA agreed.  Because the court had discharged counsel 
during the CPA proceedings, the ICA concluded that structural error happened.  The ICA vacated the TPR order and remanded the 
case.  
 We accepted DHS’s and RCGs’ applications for certiorari. *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 II. 
We hold that Father received a fundamentally fair trial.  
 
This court recently addressed what happens after a court 
appoints counsel at the start of Child Protective Act 
proceedings and later discharges counsel due to a parent’s 
deliberate failure to appear in court.  In the Interest of JH, 
No. SCWC-21-0000316, 2023 WL 2518743 (Haw. Mar. 15, 2023), held that our case law “do[es] not require automatic reversal for structural error when an indigent parent is not from start to 
finish represented by court-appointed counsel in CPA 
proceedings.”  Id. 
Instead, a fundamental fairness test applies to determine 
whether parents received due process before their parental 
rights terminated.  “There is no violation of a parent’s due 
process right to counsel when a family court discharges and 
later reappoints counsel, and the case, viewed in its entire 
context, establishes that the parent received a fundamentally fair trial and the family court accurately determined that 
parental rights should terminate.”  JH, No. SCWC-21-0000316, 
2023 WL 2518743, at *6. 
Here, the court timely appointed Father counsel.  After 
Father was defaulted for failure to appear, his counsel remained in the case.  Only when Father failed to show at the next 
hearing five months later did the court discharge his attorney.  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
6 
   And once Father contacted the family court after nearly four 
years of disinterest and no participation, the court reappointed 
his counsel. 
When Father resurfaced in the case, the court gave him an 
opportunity to set aside his default.  Father addressed the 
court.  Counsel argued on his behalf.  Because Father did not 
show good cause to support his belated request, the family court 
denied his motion and continued the default.  The court did not err.  See JH, No. SCWC-21-0000316, 2023 WL 2518743, at *5 n.9 
(noting that “if a parental rights case nears its end, then a 
court may use its discretion - after it provides a parent a fair 
process - to refuse a parent’s request to set aside a default”). 
Then, before it terminated Father’s parental rights, the 
court confirmed compliance with the Child Protective Act.  It 
found “by clear and convincing evidence that it is not reasonably foreseeable that . . . father in this case will 
become willing and able to provide [JB] with a safe family home, even with the assistance of a service plan, within a reasonable 
period of time.”  See HRS § 587A-33(a)(2).  The record contains 
substantial evidence to support the family court’s HRS § 587A-
33(a) termination of parental rights ruling. *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

We reverse the ICA’s judgment on appeal filed on April 12, 
2022.  The Family Court of the First Circuit’s April 5, 2021
