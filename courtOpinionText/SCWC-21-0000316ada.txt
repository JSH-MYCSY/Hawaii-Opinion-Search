OPINION OF THE COURT BY EDDINS, J. 1
At the start of this Child Protective Act case, the Family 
Court of the First Circuit appointed attorneys for a mother and 
father (Parents).  Then, when Parents failed to appear at a 
court hearing, the court discharged counsel.  Later, Parents 
reappeared, the court reappointed counsel, and the case

2 progressed.  After a trial, the family court terminated Parents’ 
parental rights. 
Because the family court discharged Parents’ counsel before 
the case had ended, the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) 
ruled that structural error occurred.  It ordered a new trial. 
A family court must timely appoint counsel in parental 
rights cases.  Otherwise, structural error will nullify an 
outcome adverse to a parent.  But the appointment, discharge, 
and reappointment of counsel is different. 
We hold that if the family court appoints counsel at the 
onset of a parental rights case, and later there’s a break in 
representation due to a parent’s voluntary absence, then there 
is no structural error.  As long as a fundamentally fair 
procedure ensues and due process is satisfied, the family 
court’s decision will stand. 
I. 
JH was born in October 2018.  Soon after his birth, the 
Department of Human Services (DHS) assumed custody of JH under 
the Child Protective Act, Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 587A-
8 and 587A-9.2  Then DHS petitioned for temporary foster custody. 
2At birth, JH tested positive for unprescribed opiates.  While 
hospitalized in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Kapi‘olani Medical  Center, 
JH was taken into police protective custody.  See HRS § 587A-8 (2018): 
(a)A police officer shall assume protective custody of a
child without a court order and without the consent of the*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 3 The family court appointed counsel for both parents at the 
first hearing on DHS’s petition. 
In July 2019, at a continued hearing, the court ordered 
Mother and Father to appear at a further hearing in 20 days.  
The court cautioned Parents: if they didn’t appear on that date, 
 
child’s family, if in the discretion of the police officer, 
the officer determines that: 
      (1)  The child is subject to imminent harm while in 
the custody of the child’s family; 
. . . . 
(4)  The child’ s parent has subjected the child to 
harm or threatened harm and the parent is likely to flee 
with the child. 
(b)  The department shall assume temporary foster custody 
of the child when a police officer has completed the 
transfer of protective custody of the child to the 
department as follows:  
. . . .  
(2)  If the child is or will be admitted to a 
hospital or similar institution, the police officer shall 
immediately complete the transfer of protective custody to 
the department by notifying the department and receiving an 
acknowledgment from the hospital or similar institution 
that it has been informed that the child is under the 
temporary foster custody of the department.  
 
Then, under HRS § 587A-9 (2018), DHS assumed temporary foster custody of JH. 
 
(a)  When the department receives protective custody of a 
child from the police, the department shall: 
      
 (1)  Assume temporary foster custody of the child if, 
in the discretion of the department, the department 
determines that the child is subject to imminent harm while 
in the custody of the child’ s family; [and] 
      . . . . 
       (5)  Within three days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, 
and holidays: 
(A)  Relinquish temporary foster custody, 
return the child to the child’ s parents, and proceed 
pursuant to section 587A- 11(4), (5), or (6); 
(B)  Secure a voluntary placement agreement 
from the child’ s parents to place the child in foster 
care, and proceed pursuant to section 587A- 11(6) or 
(8); or 
             (C)  File a petition with the court.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 4 August 14, then the court could order a default judgment, decide 
the petition, and award foster custody of JH to DHS. 
Neither parent showed on August 14, 2019.  The court 
entered default judgments against Parents, waived their notice 
of future hearings, and discharged their counsel effective 
August 31, 2019.3  The court advised counsel that if Parents 
contacted them, then counsel could file an ex parte motion to rescind the discharge order.  The court also ordered the parents to appear at a periodic review hearing on January 21, 2020. 
One week before the scheduled periodic review hearing, DHS 
moved to terminate Mother and Father’s parental rights.  The 
court scheduled this motion on the date of the periodic review 
hearing. 
Mother and Father appeared on January 21, 2020.  So did 
counsel.
4  Parents requested a trial on DHS’s motion to terminate 
parental rights.  Due to COVID-19 concerns and scheduling conflicts, the court continued the trial date several times. 
 
3  The Honorable Brian A. Costa presided.   
 
4  Parents appeared with their counsel at the periodic review hearing 
before the Honorable John C. Bryant.   Nothing in the record, however, 
reflects that the court reappointed counsel.  There is also nothing in the 
record – order-wise or otherwise - to reflect that Parents moved to set aside 
their default.  Instead, the proceedings just resumed as if the court had not 
discharged Parents’ attorneys and defaulted Parents.  T he family court and 
all parties - Mother, Father, DHS, and JH’s Guardian Ad Litem - proceeded as 
if Parents’ counsel had been reappointed.  T his opinion likewise treats 
Parents’ appearance with their attorneys as a reappointment of counsel.  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 5 The trial on DHS’s motion to terminate parental rights 
began nearly a year later, on January 7, 2021.5  Trial also 
happened on February 4, 2021 and March 30, 2021.  The parents, 
represented by counsel, appeared each day of their trial. 
On April 26, 2021, the family court granted DHS’s motion. 
The court terminated Mother and Father’s parental rights.  It 
awarded DHS permanent custody of JH.  The court made the 
necessary findings under HRS § 587A-33(a).6  It also issued a 
termination of parental rights order, letters of permanent 
custody, and Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. 
 Parents appealed.  The ICA ordered supplemental briefing.  
It asked the parties to brief whether its holding in In the 
Interest of J.M. and Z.M., 150 Hawaiʻ i 125, 497 P.3d 140 (App. 
2021) applied.  That is, does the discharge of counsel during parental rights proceedings violate a parent’s due process 
rights and amount to structural error? 
 
5  The Honorable Andrew T. Park presided over the trial. 
 
6  HRS § 587A-33(a) (2018) reads: 
 
(a) At a termination of parental rights hearing, the court 
shall determine whether there exists clear and convincing 
evidence that: 
(1) A child’ s parent whose rights are subject to 
termination is not presently willing and able to provide the parent’ s child with a safe family home, even with the 
assistance of a service plan;  (2) It is not reasonably foreseeable that the child’ s 
parent whose rights are subject to termination will become 
willing and able to provide the child with a safe family 
home, even with the assistance of a service plan, within a reasonable period of time, which shall not exceed two years 
from the child
’s date of entry into foster care . . . . *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 6 The ICA vacated the family court’s parental termination 
order
 and remanded for a new trial.  As with In re J.M., it 
found structural error because the court discharged Parents’ counsel before the Child Protective Act proceedings had ended. 
We accepted DHS’s cert application.  DHS argues that there 
is no structural error.  DHS maintains that despite the 
discharge of Parents’ counsel and the five-month gap in 
representation, Parents received a fundamentally fair trial; due process was satisfied. 
II. 
Parents have a substantive liberty interest to parent their 
child.  Haw. Const. art. I, § 5.  They have a fundamental right to care, control, and have custody of their children.  In re 
Doe, 99 Hawai‘ i 522, 533, 57 P.3d 447, 458 (2002). 
Parents faced with losing their parental rights have a 
right to counsel under the Hawai‘ i Constitution’s far-reaching 
due process clause.  In re T.M., 131 Hawaiʻ i 419, 434, 319 P.3d 
338, 353 (2014).  An indigent parent’s right to counsel kicks in when parental rights are substantially affected.  See In re 
L.I., 149 Hawai‘ i 118, 122, 482 P.3d 1079, 1083 (2021). 
T.M. and L.I. involve the family court’s failure to timely 
appoint counsel.  We have not addressed what happens after a court appoints counsel at the start of Child Protective Act *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 7 (CPA) proceedings and later there’s a gap in representation due 
to a parent’s failure to appear in court. 
Here, the ICA ordered a retrial.  Citing T.M., L.I., and In 
re J.M., it believed the family court violated Parents’ article 
I, section 5 due process right to counsel when it discharged appointed counsel.  The error is structural, said the ICA.  So 
Parents did not have to show that the court’s discharge of 
counsel harmed them; the gap in Parents’ legal representation was enough to vacate the order terminating their parental 
rights.  We disagree.   
There is no structural error.   T.M. and L.I. do not require automatic reversal for 
structural error when an indigent parent is not from start to finish represented by court-appointed counsel in CPA 
proceedings.   
First, the ICA blends a failure to timely appoint counsel 
and a discharge of counsel.  This case differs from T.M. and 
L.I.  In those cases the family court belatedly appointed 
counsel for indigent parents. 
In T.M., all parties had counsel throughout the CPA 
proceedings.  But not TM’s 15-year old mother.  The court appointed counsel 19 months after DHS petitioned for temporary
foster custody, about five months before the hearing that 
terminated her parental rights.  Without counsel, TM’s mother  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 8 had no legal advocate “to inform her of the limitations of the 
guardianship approach and of the possibility that if other 
options were pursued, her parental rights would be in jeopardy”;
“advise her of significant deadlines” (like the two-year cutoff 
to provide a safe family home); or provide “necessary assistance
to prepare for the . . . termination hearing.”  T.M., 131 Hawai
‘i
at 432-33, 319 P.3d at 351-52.  Mother may have kept her 
parental rights had the court appointed counsel sooner.  Id. at 
433, 319 P.3d at 352.    
 
 
T.M. held that courts must appoint counsel to indigent 
parents once DHS petitions for custody.  Requiring the family 
court to appoint counsel “remove[d] the vagaries of a case-by-
case approach.”  T.M., 131 Hawai‘ i at 435, 319 P.3d at 354.  A 
right to counsel was established. 
Then in L.I., the court held that the failure to timely 
appoint counsel in cases that substantially affect parental 
rights is structural error.  There, the family court appointed 
counsel three months after it awarded foster custody to DHS, and 
eight months after DHS first petitioned for family supervision 
of a mother’s then-only child.  L.I., 149 Hawai‘ i at 119-20, 123, 
482 P.3d at 1080-81, 1084.  The mother should have been 
appointed counsel once DHS petitioned for family supervision: 
“at that point, parental rights are substantially affected as *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 9 foster custody can be ordered by the court at a subsequent 
hearing.”  Id. at 122, 482 P.3d 1083. 
The present case is unlike T.M. and L.I.  The court timely 
appointed counsel at the start of the CPA proceedings, right 
after DHS petitioned for temporary foster custody of JH.  And 
though the family court defaulted Parents and discharged their 
attorneys, the court reappointed counsel when Parents 
reappeared.   
This is not a case where parents proceeded without counsel. 
Rather, because of the child’s best interests, it’s a case that at times necessarily proceeded without parents.  The right to 
counsel is not automatically violated when a beneficiary of that 
right voluntarily absents themself from family court 
proceedings. 
There is no structural error for another reason.  A 
fundamentally fair process may still happen in discharge of 
appointed counsel cases.   
Structural errors affect the trial’s entire framework, its 
 structure.  See State v. Reed, 135 
 381, 386, 351 P.3dHawai‘i
1147, 1152 (2015).  Because a structural error makes the trial “fundamentally unfair,” the trial is not subject to harmless 
error review.  See State v. Loher, 140 Hawai‘ i 205, 214, 398 P.3d 
794, 803 (2017).  We have identified two features of a structural error: (1) “certain rights protected by the Hawai‘ i *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 10 Constitution are so basic to a fair trial that their 
contravention can never be deemed harmless”; and (2) “an error
may be properly considered structural when the impact of the 
error on conviction is impossible to reliably assess and when 
harmless error review would require the appellate court to 
engage in pure speculation.”  Id. at 222, 398 P.3d at 811 
(cleaned up).  
Discharge of counsel cases do not present the same problems 
that surface when courts do not appoint counsel in the first 
place.  If the court does not appoint counsel at the start of 
CPA proceedings, then “the harm suffered by parents proceeding 
without counsel may not be readily apparent from the record, 
especially because without the aid of counsel, it is unlikely 
that a case is adequately presented.”  See T.M., 131 at 436, 319 
P.3d at 355 (cleaned up).   
A family court’s discharge of counsel, though, does not 
necessarily make a trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable 
way to decide whether parental rights should terminate.  Cf. In 
re RGB, 123 Hawai‘ i 1, 25, 229 P.3d, 1066, 1090 (2010) (observing 
the failure to timely appoint counsel always calls “the justice 
of the [trial] court’s decision . . . into serious question”).  
Instead, the trial’s fundamental fairness turns on the case’s 
circumstances. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 11 Third, there’s no structural error in discharge of counsel 
cases because a bright-line rule – discharge of indigent 
parents’ counsel at any stage constitutes structural error 
requiring vacatur – is inflexible.  
It ignores when, how long, 
and the reason parents’ counsel were discharged.  And it pays no attention to whether the proceedings were fundamentally fair. 
There is still another problem with a structural error 
approach to cases involving discharged counsel.  Automatic reversal and retrial cause friction with the key statutory time 
frame parents must meet to provide a safe family home.  See HRS 
§ 587A-33(a).  Parents have two years from a child’s entry into foster custody to become willing and able to provide a safe 
family home.  This two-year deadline gives parents a reasonable 
time to provide a safe family home.  And it advances the child’s 
interests in a prompt and permanent resolution of their custody 
status.  RGB, 123 Hawai‘ i at 26, 229 P.3d at 1091. 
Throughout a CPA case, family courts must protect a 
parent’s fundamental right to parent their child.  But if the 
outcome of any break in counsel is vacatur and remand, then the time it takes to permanently place a child drags on.  A parent’s 
choice not to appear in court or maintain contact with counsel 
should not undermine a child’s interests in permanency.  See 
RGB, 123  at 26, 229 P.3d at 1091 (finding that “it is in Hawai‘i*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
12 the child’s best interest and overall well being to limit the 
potential for years of litigation and instability”).  
Parents sometimes fail to show up in court.  When a parent 
inexcusably fails to appear in court, family courts often 
invoke Hawai‘ i Family Court Rules (HFCR) Rule 55(b).7  The 
parties neither question nor discuss this apparent first circuit 
norm.8  We stress that rule 55(b) should be used sparingly.  And 
because parents have a fundamental right to parent their children, family courts should freely find good cause to set 
aside a default when a parent resurfaces and re-engages in the 
case.
9 
Until then, however, it is a reasonable exercise of 
discretion for the family court to discharge counsel.  After 
7HFCR Rule 55(b) reads: 
In a contested or uncontested action, where it appears from 
the record and by testimony (or by affidavit or declaration 
in an uncontested matrimonial action) that the adverse 
party has been duly served with the complaint or dispositive motion, and the adverse party has failed to 
appear or otherwise defend as provided by these r ules, the 
court may grant an entry of default and proceed with a proof hearing, when a hearing is required, and enter a 
default judgment. 
8JH’s Guardian Ad Litem represented that “[t]he  common procedure when a 
parent fails to appear without good cause is for them to be defaulted, for 
their counsel to be discharged if parents do not make contact within a 
certain period of time, and for counsel to be re-appointed if parents do 
reappear in the case, although the court’s ruling often depends on the 
circumstances of the parents’ non-appearance.” 
9In some cases, a court cannot freely  set aside a parent’s default 
without undermining a child’s best interests and the CPA.  For instance, if a 
parental rights case nears its end, then a court may use its discretion - 
after it provides a parent a fair process - to refuse a parent’s request to 
set aside a default.*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
13 all, what’s an attorney to do?  If a parent chooses not to 
appear in court or decides not to communicate with counsel, then 
counsel is hard-pressed to understand the parent’s present 
objectives, and is challenged to provide sound, ethical 
representation.  See State v. Wilson, 144 Hawai‘ i 454, 463, 445 
P.3d 35, 44 (2019) (explaining that “counsel has a duty to
consult with the defendant before making strategic decisions
when it is feasible and appropriate to do so”); 
Hawai‘i Rules of
Professional Conduct (HRPC) Rule 1.2 (providing “a lawyer shall
abide by a client’s decisions concerning the objectives of
representation, and . . . shall consult with the client as to
the means by which the objectives are to be pursued”).
An advisement or colloquy may help.  We believe it is 
useful for family courts to advise parents at the beginning of 
Child Protective Act proceedings about the risks and 
consequences of their failure to appear and the importance of 
maintaining meaningful communication with counsel.  See State v. 
Kaulia, 128 Hawai‘ i 479, 493, 291 P.3d 377, 391 (2013) (noting 
“the best way to ensure a defendant’s constitutional rights are 
protected is for the defendant to be informed of the nature of 
the right and the consequences of waiving that right”).  
III. 
If there is no structural error after a family court 
discharges counsel in CPA proceedings, then how does an *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 14 appellate court determine whether the case satisfied due 
process? 
The court assesses the proceedings to see if they were 
fundamentally fair.  
This inquiry examines whether a parent received a 
fundamentally fair process under the circumstances of the case.  
We hold that a family court’s discharge of counsel during 
proceedings that substantially affect parental rights only violates a parent’s right to counsel if that discharge deprives 
the parent of a fundamentally fair process.   
Due process and fundamental fairness intertwine.  To 
satisfy article I, section 5, a judicial proceeding has to be 
fundamentally fair.  See RGB, 123 Hawai‘ i at 25, 229 P.3d at 1090 
(explaining that with ineffective assistance of counsel claims 
in CPA proceedings, courts should determine “whether it appears 
that the parents received a fundamentally fair trial whose facts 
demonstrate an accurate determination.”); State v. Uchima, 147 
Hawai‘i 64, 76 n.14, 464 P.3d 852, 864 n.14 (2020) (explaining 
that article I, section 5 requires “standards necessary to ensure that judicial proceedings are fundamentally fair”) 
(cleaned up)); Lassiter v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs. of Durham Cnty., 
N.C., 452 U.S. 18, 24 (1981) (finding that due process 
“expresses the requirement of ‘fundamental fairness’”). *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 15  Parents must receive “a fair procedure” before they lose 
their parental rights.  In re Doe, 99 Hawai‘ i at 533, 57 P.3d at 
458.  The due process floor entails “notice and an opportunity 
to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.”  
Id.  A fair procedure, though, is more than just notice and an 
opportunity to be heard.    Due process is versatile.  Context shapes the process that 
is due.  See Mauna Kea Anaina Hou v. Bd. of Land & Nat. Res., 
136 Hawai‘ i 376, 389, 363 P.3d 224, 237 (2015) (holding the due 
process is “flexible and depend[s] on many factors”); Sandy 
Beach Def. Fund v. City Council of City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 70 
Haw. 361, 378, 773 P.2d 250, 261 (1989) (holding that “due 
process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as 
the particular situation demands” (cleaned up)).  Due process’s versatility means that the discharge of counsel in CPA 
proceedings “must be viewed in the broader context of . . . the 
family court proceeding” as a whole.  See RGB, 123 Hawai‘ i at 27, 
229 P.3d at 1092. 
There is no violation of a parent’s due process right to 
counsel when a family court discharges and later reappoints 
counsel, and the case, viewed in its entire context, establishes 
that the parent received a fundamentally fair trial and the 
family court accurately determined that parental rights should 
terminate.   See id. at 25, 229 P.3d at 1090. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 16 IV. 
Here, Parents received a fair procedure.  They were 
appointed counsel at the onset of the CPA proceedings and had a 
meaningful opportunity to participate in their case with the aid 
of counsel. 
Parents benefitted from the assistance of court-appointed 
counsel.  Once the proceedings were underway, counsel 
represented them for 22 of 27 months.  The court discharged Parents’ attorneys and defaulted Parents only after they 
inexcusably failed to appear at a court hearing.  But when they 
did appear in court, so did counsel.
 
Parents’ ability to present their case was not materially 
impacted by the five-month gap in legal representation.  No 
hearings happened after the court discharged counsel.  And when 
Parents reappeared on January 21, 2020 at the periodic review 
hearing, counsel appeared beside them.  From then on, counsel 
represented Parents until the close of the trial on April 26, 2021, a trial that lasted three days and spanned three months. 
On the final day of trial, before the family court 
terminated Mother and Father’s parental rights, it confirmed 
compliance with the key Child Protective Act criterion: parents 
received the assistance of a service plan and “a reasonable 
period of time” to provide their child a safe family home.  See 
HRS § 587A-33(a)(2).   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 17 /s/ Mark E. Recktenwald  The family court ruled that DHS proved by clear and 
convincing evidence that parental rights should terminate.  See 
HRS § 587A-33(a)(1), (2).  The record shows that substantial 
evidence supports the family court’s HRS § 587A-33(a) 
termination of parental rights findings. 
Due process was satisfied.  Parents received a fair 
procedure before the family court terminated their parental 
rights.  See In re Doe, 99 Hawai‘ i at 533, 57 P.3d at 458.   
V. 
We reverse the ICA’s judgment on appeal filed on March 2, 
2022.  The Family Court’s April 28, 2021 Order Terminating 
Parental Rights is affirmed.
