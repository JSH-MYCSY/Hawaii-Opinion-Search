OPINION OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J.   
 
 
I.  Introduction  
 This case addresses whether the Circuit Court of the Second 
Circuit (“circuit court”)1 abused its discretion by denying Troy 
D. Borge’s (“Borge”) motion to dismiss an indictment where ,

 2 before the grand jury, the prosecutor elicit ed testimony that 
Borge had invoked his right to remain silent.   
 
We also address whether the circuit court erred by   
awarding the complaining witness (“CW”) $1,461,444.01 in 
restitution for hospital bills under Hawai‘i Revise
d Statutes 
(“HRS”) § 706- 646 (2014 & Supp. 2019) when (1) CW did not 
request restitution for these amounts; and (2) most of the bills 
were written off by the hospital a nd some were paid by CW’s 
insurer, AlohaCare.  
We hold the circuit court abused its  discretion when it 
denied Borge’s motion to dismiss indictment .  The prosecutor 
violated Borge’s Hawaiʻi due process right to a fair and 
impartial grand jury hearing by eliciting testimony before the 
grand jury that Borge invoked his right to remain silent.  
With respect to restitution, interpreting HRS § 706- 646, we 
hold that (1) restitution is limited to amounts requested by a 
victim; and (2) the restitution awarded was not for CW’s 
“reasonable and verified losses ” because (a) HRS § 706- 646(3) 
allows for restituti on only for amounts “sufficient to reimburse  
any victim fully for losses ” (emphasis added); ( b) the 
collateral source rule does not apply; and (c) e ven if HRS § 
706-646 was ambiguous, the rule of lenity would not allow the 
restitution awarded here for the reasons already provided.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 3  We therefore also overrule the opinion of the Intermediate 
Court of Appeals (“ICA”) in State v. Tuialii, 121 Hawai ‘i 135, 
214 P.3d 1125 (App. 2009), overruled on other grounds by State 
v. Kealoha, 142 Hawai ‘i 46, 414 P.3d 98 (2018), which held that a 
restitution award can include sums paid by a direct victim’s 
insurer.  
Hence, we  vacate the circuit court ’s September 3, 2020 
findings of fact, c onclusions of law, and o rder denying motion 
to dismiss indictment (“order denying motion to dismiss 
indictment”), June 7, 2021 judgment of conviction and sentence 
(“judgment”), and June 17, 2021  free-standing order of 
restitution, as well as the ICA’s October 19, 2022 j udgment on 
appeal, and we remand to the circuit court for dismissal of the 
indictment and further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 
II.  Background 
A.  Factual background   
On November 5, 2019, the Maui Police Department (“MPD”) 
responded to an incident at the
 Pā‘ia Youth and Cultural Center.  
CW suffered serious injuries after Borge struck him on the head 
several times with a piece of wood.  MPD arrested Borge the 
following day and initiated criminal charges.  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 4  B.  Circuit court proceedings 
 1. First indictment 
On November 22, 2019, the State of Hawai ʻi (“the State”) 
presented the case to a grand ju
ry, which returned an indictment 
charging Borge with attempted second- degree murder in violation 
of HRS §§ 705-500(2) (2014 ) and 707- 701.5 (2014 & Supp. 2018) .2  
On April 13, 2020, however, the circuit court3 granted 
Borge’s motion to dismiss t he first indictment without 
prejudice.4  
 
 
 
                                                 
2  The State actually first prosecuted Borge in the District Court of the 
Second Circuit (“district court” ) in case no. 2DCW -19-2338.  The complaint 
charged Borge with attempted murder in the second degree.  The Honorable 
Kristin M. Hamman found probable cause lacking for the attempted second -
degree murder charge, but found probable cause for the lesser included 
offense of first- degree assault.  The State then filed an amended complaint 
charging attempted first -degree assault and the district court committed 
Borge to the circuit court for further proceedings.   No further action 
appears in the record on this cha rge.   
 
 Then, on April 14, 2020, the day after the first indictment was 
dismissed, the State filed a felony information against Borge 
in case no. 
2CPC-20-207, charging him with first -degree assault.  On September 13, 2021, 
after Borge’s conviction and s entencing in th e case before this court, the 
Honorable Kelsey T. Kawano granted the State’s motion to dismiss th e felony 
information without prejudice .  
 
3  The Honorable Rhonda I.L. Loo presided over the circuit court 
proceedings in case no. 2CPC -19-795. 
 
4  The circuit court concluded the State improperly presented hearsay 
testimony regarding an eyewitness ’s statements to the police and statements 
of CW’s treating physician.  The State appealed to the ICA, but the appeal 
was dismissed after the State re -indicted Borge in the case now before this 
court.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 5  2. Second indictment 
 On June 26, 2020, the State convened a second grand jury 
proceeding.  The State presented testimony from an eyewitness 
and MPD Detective Dennis Clifton  (“Detective Clifton”) . 
Detective Clifton testified that he was assigned to 
investigate the case and that  he met with Borge on November 7, 
2019, the day after Borge was arrested.  The prosecutor then 
questioned Detective Clifton about that contact: 
Q.  . . .  . Did you notice any injures to Mr. Borge?  
A.  No. 
Q.  None to his head, arms, anyplace?  
A.  No, sir.  
Q.  Okay.  And you didn’t take any statement from Mr. 
Borge? 
A.  We attempted to question him, but he requested to speak 
to an attorney . 
 
(Emphases added.)  
After completing questioning of Detective Clifton, the 
prosecutor stated, “Before I proceed, Detective Clifton 
testified [that] Mr. Borge was asking for an attorney.  I’m 
going to advise the grand jury that you’re not to consider that 
information in your deliberation.”  
 On June 29, 2020, the grand jury returned a
 second 
indictment, again charging Borge with attempted second- degree 
murder.  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 6   3. Motion to dismiss second indictment 
 On July 17, 2020, Borge mo ved to dismiss th e second 
indictment.5  Borge argued the prosecutor committed prosecutorial 
misconduct before the grand jury in violation of his due process 
rights by improperly eliciting  testimony that he had exercised 
his right to remain silent.  He pointed to Detective Clifton ’s 
testimony that MPD “attempted to question” Borge, “but he 
requested to speak to an attorney.”  
The circuit court denied Borge’s motion to dismiss the 
second indictment and, on September 3, 2020, entered its order 
denying motion to dismiss indictment.  
4. No contest plea  
 On December 7, 2020, Borge entered a no- contest plea to the 
lesser included offense of a ssault in the f irst degree in 
violation of HRS § 707-710 (2014).  Borge reserved the right to 
                                                 
5  Borge initially asserted HRS § 701- 110(2) (2014) and the doctrine of 
collateral estoppel barred the indictment because the district court entered 
a final order committing only the lesser included first -degree assault 
charge, not the attempted second -degree murder charge, to the circuit court 
for further proceedings.  Borge is not pursuing that claim on certiorari and 
we therefore do not address it .  
 
Borge also alleged the prosecutor presented excessive hearsay and 
failed to present clearly exculpatory evidence.  He asserted the individual 
and cumulative effect of the alleged misconduct violated his due process 
right to a fair and unbiased grand jury.  In addition, Borge asserted the 
indictment must be dismissed because the evidence presented to the grand jury 
was insufficient to establish probable cause that Borge committed attempted 
second-degree murder.   Because we hold the improper elicitation of testimony 
regarding Borge’s invocation of his right to remain silent requires dismissal 
of the indictment, we do not further discuss these additional arguments.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 7    appeal the circuit court’s order denying motion to dismiss 
indictment.  
 5. Sentencing, including restitution order  
A presentence report was filed on February 2, 2021.  The 
circuit court ordered the filing of a restitution report.  In 
the Second Circuit, the court’s special services branch  contacts 
those identified in the police report to determine whether they 
are victims who have sustained losses and wish to submit claims 
for restitution.  
On April 7, 2021, the State filed a
n addendum to the 
presentence report regarding restitution.  It included a 
restitution claim from CW’s mother requesting $6,320.66 for her 
and her husband’s air fare, lodging, ground transportation, food, 
and other expenses for their travel back and forth from their 
North Dakota home due to CW’s injuries and hospitalizations .7  
The court officer recommend ed restitution totaling $5,030.64 
from these amounts.   The circuit court denied the claims from 
CW’s parents. 
However, th e addendum also included 115 pages of billing 
records from Maui Memorial reflecting total medical bills of at 
                                                 
7  The request also included $100 for dental services and a $770 credit 
card charge from Maui Health System’s Maui Memorial Medical Center (“Maui 
Memorial”), both of which the court officer did not recommend based on 
“insufficient documentation.”  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 8 least $1,461,444.01,8 and also reflecting  payments of $204,174.49 
by AlohaCare as well as adjustments or write-off s of 
$996,283.16.9 
The circuit court held several 
hearings  on sentencing and 
restitution; Borge continuously objected to restitution being 
ordered for the medical bills.10   
On June 7, 2021, the circuit court entered its judgment
, 
convicting Borge of first- degree assault and sentencing him to a 
ten-year term of imprisonment.  T he circuit court also sentenced 
Borge to pay restitution of $1,461,444.01 for CW’s medical 
bills.  On June 17, 2021, the circuit court also entered a free-
standing order of restitution, ordering Borge to pay CW 
the 
$1,461,444.01. 
 
 
                                                 
8  According to the State, this is the total amount for all billings in 
the record.  
 
9  The bills appear to reflect payments of $160,008.20, $245.88, and 
$43,920.41, sub- totaling $204,174.49 , adjustments or write -offs of 
$617,625.08, $387.12, and $378,270.96, sub -totaling $996,283.16,  and a 
remaining balance of $261,619.36.  These amounts would  total $1,462,077.01, a 
difference from the $1,461,4 44.01 that would not be reconciled by the $7 70 
credit card charge referenced supra in note 6.  These differences are 
immaterial, however, for the rulings in this opinion.  
 
10  At the June 4, 2021  hearing, the circuit court referenced a filing from 
the State, “ consisting  of a declaration of custodian of records submitted 
under cover from Alana Kushi (phonetic), who declares pursuant to declaration 
that she is the patient financial services assistant with Maui Health System, 
Maui Memorial Medical Center; that she is the custodian of records on behalf 
of Maui Health System Maui Memorial Medical Center; that Maui Health System, 
Maui Memorial Medical Center maintains the attached billing records; and 
attached billing records are true and correct copies of the billing records; 
and that those billing records contain 115 pages for ” CW.  This filing does 
not appear in the record.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 9 C.  ICA proceeding 
On appeal, Borge asserted the circuit court erred when it  
(1) denied his motion to dismiss the second indictment; and (2) 
ordered he pay restitution to CW that included medical expenses 
paid by CW’s insurance provider.  Borge repea ted the arguments 
raised in his motion to dismiss the second indictment.  Borge 
additionally argued the restitution order was not supported by 
our restitution statute, HRS § 706 -646. 
 On September 14, 2022, the ICA filed a s ummary disposition 
order affirming the circuit court’s judgment.  State v. Borge, 
No. CAAP-21- 0000364 (Haw. App. Sept. 14, 2022) (SDO).  With 
respect to the issues we address on certiorari, the ICA 
concluded the prosecutor’s examination of Detective Clifton did 
not violate Borge’s due process right to a fair and impartial 
grand jury.  Id. at 4-6.  Citing State v. Rodrigues , 113 Hawai ‘i 
41, 147 P.3d 825  (2006), the ICA framed the prosecutor’s line of 
inquiry “as detailing the actions Detective Clifton took the 
night of the incident[.]”  Borge, SDO at 5  (citing Rodrigues, 
113 Hawai‘ i at 49–50, 147 P.3d at 833-34).  The ICA noted 
Detective Clifton referenced Borge’s silence only once .  Id.  
The ICA reasoned that “the prosecutor did not comment on Borge’s 
silence, did not use his silence to imply his guilt, and 
immediately gave curative instructions to the grand jury[ ,]” so *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 10 the questioning did not constitute prosecutorial misconduct.  
Id. at 6. 
The ICA also addressed Borge’s assertion  that the 
restitution order did not comply with the statutory requirements 
set out by HRS § 706- 646.  Id. at 12-14.  The ICA cited its 
Tuialii opinion  for the proposition that HRS § 706- 646 “does not 
support the theory that a crime victim has not suffered a loss 
if (or to the extent that) the victim has received 
indemnification from its insurer[.]”  Borge, SDO at 12 (citing 
State v. Martin, No. CAAP-19 -0000220 (Haw. App. Mar. 10, 2020) 
(SDO) (citing Tuialii, 121 Hawai ʻi at 139
-42, 214 P.3d at 1129-
32)).  The ICA did not address Bor ge’s argument that the 
insurance carrier was not a victim.  See  id. at 12-14. 
D.  Certiorari proceedings 
 On certiorari, Borge asserts the ICA erred in affirming the 
circuit court’s (1) order denying  motion to dismiss indictment; 
and (2) restitution order.  Borge repeats his arguments raised 
below.   
III.  Standards of Review 
A.  Motion to dismiss indictment 
 “A motion to dismiss an indictment is . . . reviewed for an 
abuse of discretion.  The trial court abuses its discretion when 
it clearly exceeds the bounds of reason or disregards rules or 
principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 11 party litigant.”  State v. Pitts , 146 Hawai ʻi 120, 129, 456 P.3d 
484, 493 (2019) (citation s omitted).  “The burden of 
establishing abuse of discretion is on appellant, and a strong 
showing is required to establish it.”  State v. Wong , 97 Hawaiʻi 
512, 517, 40 P.3d 914, 919 (2002) (citation omitted).  
“[D]ismissal of an indictment is required only in flagrant cases 
in which the grand jury has been overreached or deceived in some 
significant way.”   97 Hawaiʻi at 526, 40 P.3d at 928.  
B.  Constitutional violations 
“Questions of constitutional law are reviewed under the 
right/wrong standard.”  Pitts, 146 Hawai ‘i at 129, 456 P.3d at 
493 (citation omitted).  
C.  Statutory interpretation 
“The interpretation of a statute is a question of law.  
Review is de novo , and the standard of review is right/wrong.”  
Kimura v. Kamalo, 106 Hawai ‘i 501, 507, 107 P.3d 430, 436 (2005) 
(citation omitted).  Our statu tory interpretation is guided by 
the following principles: 
First, the fundamental starting point for statutory 
interpretation is the language of the statute itself.  
Second, where the statutory language is plain and 
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain 
and obvious meaning.  Third, implicit in the task of 
statutory construction is our foremost obligation to 
ascertain and give effect to the intention of the 
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the 
language contained in the statute itself.  Fourth, when 
there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness 
or uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, an 
ambiguity exists.  And fifth, in construing an ambiguous 
statute, the meaning of the ambiguous words may be sought *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 12 by examining the context, with which the ambiguous words, 
phrases, and sentences may be compared, in order to 
ascertain their true meaning.  
 
Ito v. Invs. Equity Life Holding Co., 135 Hawai ʻi 49, 61, 346 
P.3d 118, 130 (2015) (citation omitted).  
IV.  Dis cussion 
A. The prosecutor violated Borge’s due process right to a 
 fair and impartial grand jury hearing by eliciting 
 testimony before the grand jury that Borge invoked his 
 right to remain silent 
 
Article I, section 5 of the Constitution of the State of 
Hawaiʻi provides that no person shall be deprived of liberty 
without due process of law.  We have recognized that due process 
of law requires a fair and impartial grand jury hearing.  
State 
v. Rodrigues, 63 Haw. 412, 417, 629 P.2d 1111, 1115 (1981).  
Further, prosecutorial misconduct that undermines the 
fundamental fairness and integrity of the grand jury process is 
presumptively prejudicial.  Wong, 97 Hawaiʻi at 517-18, 40 P.3d 
at 919-20 (citations omitted).  But “‘prosecutorial misconduct ’ 
is a legal term of art that refers to any improper action 
committed by a prosecutor, however harmless or unintentional. ”  
State v. Williams, 146 Hawai‘ i 62, 72, 456 P.3d 135, 145 (2020) 
(citation omitted).  
 We have also repeatedly recognized the importance of th e 
constitutional right against self -incrimination.  See, e.g. , 
State v. Mainaaupo , 117 Hawai‘ i 235, 252, 178 P.3d 1, 18 (2008) *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 13 (“There is nothing more basic and more fundamental than that the 
accused has a constitutional right to remain silent, and the 
exercise of this privilege may not be used against [them].” 
(citations omitted))
.  This right is secured  by article I, 
section 10 of the Hawai ‘i Constitu
tion, which provides, “nor 
shall any person be compelled in any criminal case to be a 
witness against oneself .”  The ri ght against self-incrimination 
is sacrosanct.  See Brown v. Walker, 161 U.S. 591, 637 (1896) 
(“The reprobation of compulsory self -incrimination is an 
established doctrine of our civilized society.”); Havard v. 
State, 94 So.3d 229, 237 (Miss. 2012) (“A defendant’s right 
against self incrimination is not only sacrosanct, but is 
commonly known across this land.”).  
Hence, w e have held the right prohibits the prosecution 
from adducing evidence of or commenting on a person’s exercise 
of that right.  See State v. Beaudet-Close, 148 Hawai ʻi
 66, 72-
73, 468 P.3d 80, 86 -87 (2020).  We have further held that a 
prosecutor may not directly or indirectly imply guilt by 
eliciting testimony  during a question -and-answer exchange with  a 
witness at trial concerning a defendant ’s exercise of their 
right to remain silent.  State v. Tsujimura , 140 Hawai ʻi 299, 
315-18, 400 P.3d 500, 51 6-19 (2017) .  In those circumstances, we 
have applied the following test:  “ whether the prosecutor 
intended for the information elicited to imply the defendant’s *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 14  guilt or whether the character of the information suggests to 
the factfinder that the defendant’s prearrest silence may be 
considered as inferential evidence of the defendant’s guilt.”  
140 Hawai‘ i at 315, 400 P.3d at 516 (citing Rodrigues , 113 
Hawai‘i 41, 147 P.3d 825).  
Before the second grand jury, the prosecutor  asked 
Detective Clifton “And you didn’t take any statement from Mr. 
Borge?”  Detective Clifton responded , “We attempted to question 
him, but he requested to speak to an attorney.”   
The prosecutor may not have known that Detective Clif ton 
would respond as he did.  But he did know Borge had refused to 
make a statement.  If a grand jur or had asked that question, the 
prosecutor or grand jury counsel would have needed to inform the 
jury that it was not a proper question.   It is difficult to 
understand why, in any  grand jury proceeding, a prosecutor would 
ask an officer whether he obtained the defendant’s statement 
when the answer is “no.”  Not only is such a question not needed 
to obtain an indictment,11 absent unusual circumstances, the 
question and answer would violate a defendant’s constitutional 
right against self-incrimination.  
Regarding unusual circumstances, 
the State, as well as the 
ICA, opine that the question and answer were allowed by 
                                                 
11  During the first grand jury proceeding, the State did not ask Detective 
Clifton whether Borge had given a statement before the jury returned the 
attempted murder indictment.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 15 Rodrigues, 113 Hawai ʻi 41, 147 P.3d 825.  See Borge, SDO at 5- 6 
(citing Rodrigues, 113 Hawaiʻ i at 49–50, 147 P.3d at 833–34).  In 
Rodrigues, at trial, the prosecutor elicited testimony that the 
defendant declined to agree to an audiotaped reiteration of his 
post-arrest statement to a detective.  113 Hawai‘i at 49, 147 
P.3d at 833.  We held that , under the circumstances of that 
case, the elicited statement was not an improper comment on the 
defendant’s refus al to testify.  113 Hawai‘i at 49-50, 147 P.3d 
at 833-34.  We stated the prosecutor’s conduct  was not improper 
because the question was posed and the information was elicited 
“as part of the prosecution’s effort to maximize the 
reliability” of the det ective’s recollections “and to explain 
why the detective could only rely on his notes and not an 
audiotape of the interview[.]”   Id.   
 Rodrigues , however, concerned unusual circumstances in a 
trial setting.  The opinion does not affect a defendant’s 
fundamental right against self- incrimination, nor  the 
prohibition against the State adducing evidence of or commenting 
on a defendant’s exercise of that right.  Rodrigues  held that 
the circumstances there d id not rise to an improper comment on 
the defendant’s refusal to testify , but its holding is limited 
to the unusual facts of that case.  Rodrigues  does not stand for 
the proposition that the State can routinely ask an officer 
whether there was an attempt t o take a defendant’s statement , *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 16 knowing that the defendant had refused, under the guise of 
establishing that an officer conducted a thorough investigation.  
 Further, Rodrigues also said the “line of inquiry designed 
to establish the detective’s custom and  practice regarding 
accurately transcribing such statements, was unaccompanied by 
any implication of guilt[.]”  Id.; see also  Tsujimura, 140 
Hawaiʻi at 318, 400 P.3d at  519 (emphasizing that R odrigues does 
not permit the indirect use of a defendant’s silence to imply 
guilt).  Rodrigues also does not mean, however,  that if the 
State posits that testimony adduced regarding a defendant’s 
exercise of the right against self-
incrimination was not 
intended to imply guilt, admission of or comment on such 
testimony becomes permissible.  Such a subjective standard would 
vitiate a defendant’s right against self -incrimination.  
 Rather, we hold that in the grand jury context, the test is 
whether the prosecutor intended for the information elicited to 
imply probable cause exists or whether the character of the 
information suggests to the jurors  that the accused’s silence 
may be considered as inferential evidence to find probable 
cause.  See Tsujimura, 140 Hawai ‘i at 315, 400 P.3d at 516 
(citing Rodrigues, 113 Hawai‘ i 41, 147 P.3d 825).   Here, whether 
or not the State anticipated Detective Clifton ’s response,12 the 
                                                 
12  The State argues the prosecutor ’s inquiry did not cons titute misconduct 
because Detective Clifton’s testimony was non-responsive.  Although the  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 17  character of the evidence clearly indicates its presentation was 
improper.  The State adduced express evidence  that Borge refused 
to give a statement to Detective Clifton.  Simply put, the 
prosecutor should not have posed the question in the first 
place.13 
The question and answer constituted a flagrant violation of 
Borge’s due process rights.  Hence, we hold the circuit court 
abused its discretion when it denied Borge’s motion to dismiss 
this indictment.   
B.   The circuit court erred by ordering Borge to pay 
 $1,461,444.01 in restitution to CW 
  
Borge also asserts the circuit court erred by ordering him 
to pay CW $1,461,444.01 in restitution for medical bills from 
                                                                                                                                                             
prosecutor’s question technically called for a “yes” or “no” answer, 
Detective Clifton’s answer was responsive.  It addressed whether he took a 
statement from Borge; indeed, the question itself implicated Borge’s righ t to 
remain silent.  W e do not address possible scenarios in which a witness’s 
answer is completely non -responsive. 
 
13  The ICA also agreed with the State’s contention that the prosecutor 
advisement to the grand jury to disregard Detective Clifton’s cured any 
misconduct.  Borge, SDO at 5-6.  We have held a  curative instruction can 
sometimes “cure”  prosecutorial misconduct.  Mainaaupo, 117 Hawai ‘i at 255, 178 
P.3d at 21 (citation omitted).  We note that a  “cure” generally comes from a 
judge’s instruction, not from a prosecutor.  HRS § 612-16(d) (2016) provides 
in relevant part: 
 
[T]he [cir cuit] court shall give [the grand jur ors] such 
information as it may deem proper as to their duties and as 
to the law pertaining to such cases as may come before 
them.  The court may further charge the grand jurors and 
alternate grand jurors from time to time, as it may deem 
necessary.   
 
 In any case, the “advisement” given  here could not have constituted a 
“cure” even if given by the circuit court.  The advisement was merely to 
disregard D etective Clifton’s testimony that Borge “was asking fo r an 
attorney.”  There was no instruction to disregard Borge’s refusal to give a 
statement, i.e., his exercise of his right to remain silent.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 18 Maui Memorial.  Borge asserts the ordered restitution does not 
comply with HRS § 706
-646. 
HRS § 706 -646 provides in relevant part:   
(1) As used in this section, “victim” includes  any of the 
following:  
(a) The direct victim of a crime including a business 
entity, trust, or governmental entity ; 
. . . . 
(c) A governmental entity that has reimbursed the 
victim for losses arising as a result of the crime or 
paid for medical care provided to the victim as a 
result of the crime[.] 
. . . . 
(2) The court shall order the defendant to make restitution 
for reasonable and  verified losses suffered by the victim 
or victims as a result of the defendant’s offense when 
requested by the victim. . . .  
(3) In ordering restitution, the court shall not consider 
the defendant’s financial ability to make restitution in 
determining the  amount of restitution to order.  The court, 
however, shall consider the defendant’s financial ability 
to make restitution for the purpose of establishing the 
time and manner of payment.  . . . Restitution shall be a 
dollar amount that is sufficient to reimburse any victim 
fully for losses, including but not limited to : 
(a) Full value of stolen or damaged property, as 
determined by replacement costs of like property, or 
the actual or estimated cost of repair, if repair is 
possible;  
(b) Medical expenses, which shall include mental  
health treatment, counseling, and therapy ; 
(c) Funeral and burial expenses; and  
(d) Lost earnings, which shall include paid leave.  
 
(Emphases added.) 
For the following reasons, w
e agree that the circuit 
court’s restitution or der was erroneous and must be vacated.     
1. Under HRS §  706-646, restitution is only to be  
 awarded to a victim only for amounts requested 
 
 Subsection (1) of HRS §  706-646 allows for restitution to a 
“victim.”  Under HRS § 706- 646(1)(a) and (c), “victim” means the 
“direct victim of a crime ” or a “governmental entity that has *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 19  reimbursed the victim for losses arising as a result of the 
crime or paid for medical care provided to the victim as a 
result of the crime[ .]”  CW is obviously a direct victim under 
subsection (1)(a).  The record does not indicate, however, that 
Maui Memorial and AlohaCare are governmental entities.  In any 
event, the restitution was awarded to CW.  
In State v. Demello, 136 Hawai ‘i 193, 196, 361 P.3d 420, 423 
(2015), we held HRS § 706- 646 allows for restitution of a 
victim’s losses that are (1) reasonable, (2) verified, (3) 
suffered as a result of the defendant’s conduct, and (4) 
requested by the victim.  The language in requirement (4) 
expressly appears in subsection (2).  See HRS § 706-646(2). 
Here, the circuit court awarded $1,461,444.01 in 
restitution to CW for medical bills from Maui Memorial.  But CW 
did not request restitution for these medical bills.  Rather, 
the record includes  a restitution  claim from CW’s mother 
requesting $6,320.66 for her and her husband’s air fare , lodging, 
ground transportation, food, and other expenses for their travel 
back and forth from their North Dakota home due to CW’s injuries 
and hospitalizations.14  Even if we assume CW’s parents had 
requested restitution on behalf of CW, CW never requested 
restitution for the medical bills that were awarded to him.  
                                                 
14  As noted, the request also included $100 for dental services and a $770 
credit card charge from Maui Memorial,  both of which the court officer did 
not recommend based on “insufficient documentation.”  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 20  Therefore, for this reason alone, the circuit court erred by 
awarding the $1,461,444.01 in medical expenses as restitution to 
CW.  
2. The restituti on awarded was not for CW’s reasonable 
 and verified losses   
 
Borge also argues that  restitution was erroneously ordered 
because AlohaCare paid Maui Memorial for CW’s medical expenses.  
In other words, he argues that payments made on behalf of a 
direct victim by collateral sources are not “reasonable and 
verified losses” of the direct victim.15 
The circuit court awarded restitution for the total of 
billings from Maui Memorial, including payments of at least 
$204,174.49 by AlohaCare and $996,283.16 in adjustments or 
write-offs.16   
 a. HRS §  706-646(3) allows for restitution only for  
   amounts sufficient to reimburse a victim fully  
   for losses 
   
 HRS §  706-646(3) expressly provides that “[r]estitution 
shall be a dollar amount that is sufficient to reimburse any 
victim fully for losses[.] ”  HRS § 706 –646 does not define 
“losses” other than the categories of “losses” listed in 
subsection (3).  Construing an early version of the original 
                                                 
15  We address this issue based on the “capable of repetition, yet evading 
review” exception to the mootness doctrine.  See State v. Tui, 138 Hawai ʻi 
462, 468, 382 P.3d 274, 280 (2016).  
 
16  See supra note 8. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 21 restitution statute, however, we stated, “[t]he total amount of 
the restitution ordered by the trial court should be the actual 
loss or damage incurred by the victim .”  State v. Johnson, 68 
Haw. 292, 295, 711 P.2d 1295, 1298 (1985) (emphasis added) 
(citing HRS §§ 706 –605(1)(e), 706 –624(2)(i)).17   
The plain language of HRS §  706-646(3) does not allow a 
restitution award to include adjustments of bills written off by 
medical providers.  The victim never paid these amounts.  Hence, 
the victim does not need to be “reimbursed” for amounts never 
paid.   
By the same token, this plain  language does not allow a 
restitution award to a direct victim to include medical expenses 
paid by an insurer or indemnifier.  A direct victim has not paid 
these amounts, so there is nothing to “reimburse.”   
Amounts paid by a medical or casualty insurer differ  from 
the “lost wages” we allowed in Demello, which is now reflected 
in section 706-646(3)(d), which provides restitution for “[l]ost 
earnings, which shall include paid leave.”  This is because a 
victim should be “reimbursed” for paid leave the victim used due 
to a defendant’s offense, which the victim otherwise would have 
been able to take for other reasons. 
 
                                                 
17  In Johnson, we used the term “actual loss” to affirm a restitution 
order in the amount of “$5,406.33 less $75.00 .”  68 Haw. at 295- 97, 711 P.2d 
at 1298- 99. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 22  b. The collateral source rule does not apply 
The circuit court applied  the ICA’s opinion in Tuialii, 121 
Hawaiʻi 135, 214 P.3d 1125, when it ordered this restitution 
award.   
 In Tuialii, the ICA held the trial court properly ordered 
restitution to a direct victim of sums already paid by its  
insurer.  121 Hawai ‘i at 139, 214 P.3d at 1129.  The ICA 
posited 
that HRS § 706- 646 does not call for reduction of restitution 
due to insured victims.  121 Hawai‘ i at 140, 214 P.3d at 1130.  
The ICA opined the legislature “had two intended purposes when 
adopting restitution”:  
[I]n the criminal justice system, the victim of crime is 
almost always negle cted.  By requiring the “convicted 
person” to make restitution and reparation to the 
victim, justice is served .  In so doing, the criminal 
repays not only “society” but the persons injured by the 
criminal’s acts.  There is a dual benefit to this concept:  
The victim is repaid for his loss and the criminal may 
develop a degree of self -respect and pride in knowing that 
he or she has righted the wrong committed . 
 
121 Hawai‘ i at 141, 214 P.3d at 1131 (second emphasis added) 
(quoting S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 789, in 1975 Senate Journal, 
at 1132).  The ICA concluded that requiring a defendant to pay 
restitution, even for amounts indemnified by the direct victim’s 
insurer, “furthers the rehabilitative purposes of HRS § 706 -646 
to the greatest extent possible.”  121  Hawai‘i at 142, 214 P.3d 
at 1132.18   
                                                 
18  The ICA concluded a criminal court therefore “need not sort out 
insurance indemnities, subrogation rights, and/or other potential civil law *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
23 Justice Pollack ’s dissent in Demello opined that, contrary 
to Tuialii, “losses” do not include amounts covered by 
collateral sources like insurance.  See Demello, 136 Hawai ‘i at 
216 n.24, 361 P.3d at 443 n.24 (Pollack, J., dissenting) (“[A]n 
order of restitution based on gross receipts, instead of net 
income, would seemingl y not represent [the victim’s] actual 
loss.” (emphasis added)) .  We now address the issue and agree 
that the collateral source rule does not apply to HRS §  706-646. 
The collateral source rule is a common law doctrine.  Bynum  
v. Magno, 106 Hawai ‘i 81, 86 n.11, 101 P.3d 1149, 1154 n.11
(2004) (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts § 920A cmt. d 
(1979)).19  At common law, a civil defendant would be  entitled to 
a jury trial for amounts over $5,000 under article I, section 13 
of the Hawai‘i Constitution.   The Hawaiʻi Rules of Evidence 
(“HRE”), HRS Chapter 626, would govern a trial determination of 
whether medical expenses are reasonable and causally related to 
implications before ordering a thief or other criminal to repay his victim 
under the criminal restitution statute. ”  121 Hawaiʻ i at 142, 214 P.3d at 
1132.  This court rejected certiorari.  State v. Tuialii, No. 29239 (Haw. 
Jan. 11, 2010) (order), denying cert. to 121 Hawai ‘i 135, 214 P.3d 1125  (App. 
2009). 
19As explained in Bynum, in general, the collateral  source rule is a tort
law concept that payments made to an injured person from an independent 
source does not diminish recovery from the wrongdoer.   106 Hawai‘i at 86, 101
P.3d at 1154. The Restatement (Second) of Torts § 920A  provides that, under 
the collateral source rule, p ayments made to or benefits conferred on an 
injured party from other sources are not credited against the tortfeasor ’s 
liability, “ although they cover all or a part of the harm for which the 
tortfeasor is liable. ”  Comment b to section 920A further explains that 
although double compensation may result to the plaintiff, such a benefit 
should redound to the injured party rather than “become a windfall” to the 
party causing the injury.  Restatement (Second) of Torts § 920A cmt. b.  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 24 an incident.  Pursuant to HRE Rule 1101(d)(3) (2016), however, 
the 
Hawaiʻi Rules 
of Evidence do not even apply to sentencing 
proceedings, including restitution determinations. 
 The rest itution at issue here is simply not based on the 
common law of torts; it is a statutorily authorized remedy under 
the Hawaiʻ i
 Penal Code.  And the goal of restitution has 
traditionally generally been to prevent injustice and unjust 
enrichment, Small v. Badenhop, 67 Haw. 626, 636 &  n.12 & 13, 701 
P.2d 647, 654 & n.12 & 13 (1985), and not to award “damages” to 
which the tort-action collateral source rule applies.  
Hence, we hold the collateral source rule does not apply to 
restitution under HRS § 706 -646.  Application of the rule would 
be inconsistent with the plain language of subsection (3), which 
only allows for a victim to be “reimbursed” for actual losses. 
 Hence, the ICA’s holding in Tuialii  that a restitution 
award can include sums paid by  an insurer to a victim is 
overruled.   
c.  Even if HRS § 706 -646 was ambiguous, the rule of 
 lenity would now allow the restitution awarded 
 in this case 
 
Finally, if a statute is ambi guous, and the legislative 
history does not provide sufficient guidance, we follow 
the rule of  lenity.  The rule of lenity provides that where a 
criminal statute is ambiguous, it “must be strictly construed 
against the government and in favor of the accused. ”  State v. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 Guyton, 135 Hawai ʻi 372, 380, 351 
P.3d 1138, 1146 (2015) 
(citations  omitted); see  also Bittner v. United States, 143 S. 
Ct. 713, 724 (2023) (“Under the rule of lenity, this Court has 
long held, statutes imposing penalties are to be ‘construed 
strictly’ against the government and in favor of individuals
.” 
(citation omitted)) .   
HRS § 706 -646 is not ambiguous with respect to the 
restitution issues addressed in this opinion.  But, even if it 
was, the rule of lenity would mandate that we interpret the 
statute in Borge’s favor  based on the reasons already explained.   
For all these reasons, the circuit court erred by awarding 
$1,461,444.01 in restitution to CW.  
V.  Conclusion 
Based on the reasoning above, we vaca te the circuit court ’s 
September 3, 2020 findings of fact, conclusions of law, and 
order denying motion to dismiss indictment, June 7, 2021 
judgment of conviction and sentence, and June 17, 2021 free-
standing order of restitution, as well as the ICA’s October 19, 
2022 judgment on appeal, and we remand to the circuit court for  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
