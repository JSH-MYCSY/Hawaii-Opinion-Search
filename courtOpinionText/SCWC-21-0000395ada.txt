Dkt. 16 OP*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 2 Rommel Bautista argues that the State of Hawaiʻ i must refile 
a complaint in circuit court after a district court finds 
probable cause to support a felony and commits a case to circuit court.  The State only filed a district court complaint, 
Bautista’s argument goes, so the circuit court lacked subject 
matter jurisdiction.  We disagree.   
We hold that if the State files a complaint in district
court, and the district court lawfully commits the case to 
circuit court, then the circuit court has jurisdiction.   
 Relying on State v. Obrero, 151 
Hawaiʻi 472, 517 P.3d 755 
(2022), Bautista challenges the circuit court’s power to act 
another way.  But Obrero has limited retroactive effect, so 
Bautista’s Hawaiʻ i Revised Statues (HRS) § 801-1 (2014) attack 
comes too late.  
Bautista also argues that the circuit court improperly 
imposed two consecutive sentences.  Because the circuit court 
did not provide adequate independent grounds to impose each 
consecutive sentence, we remand for resentencing.  
II. 
The State filed a district court complaint against Rommel 
Bautista.  The complaint alleged seven violent crimes, including 
attempted murder in the second degree.  The victim was 
Bautista’s wife.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
3 The District Court of the Second Circuit held a preliminary 
hearing.  It found probable cause to support each count.  Then 
the court confirmed bail and committed the case to the Circuit 
Court of the Second Circuit.
No circuit court complaint was filed.  At his arraignment 
in circuit court, Bautista pled not guilty.
About five months after the State charged him, Bautista and 
the State reached a plea deal.  Bautista pled no contest to 
three counts, all class C felonies: assault in the second degree 
(HRS § 707-711(1)(a) (2014 & Supp. 2018)), terroristic 
threatening in the first degree (HRS § 707-716(1)(e) (2014)), 
and abuse of a family or household member in the presence of a 
minor (HRS § 709-906(1) and (9) (2014 & Supp. 2019)).  Per the 
plea agreement, the State dropped the attempted murder charge 
(HRS § 705-500(2) (2014) and § 707-701.5 (2014 & Supp. 2018)), 
the assault in the first degree HRS § 707-710(1) (2014) charge, 
and two counts of abuse of a family or household member by 
strangulation (HRS § 709-906(1) and (8) (2014 & Supp. 2019)).  
There were no sentencing terms in the plea agreement.  Bautista 
could seek probation.  The State could seek any lawful sentence.  
The circuit court accepted Bautista’s no contest pleas.
Two months later, the court held a sentencing hearing.  Due
to the pandemic, Bautista did not appear in court for his 
sentencing.  He appeared via video link from the Maui Community  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
4 Correctional Center.  His wife, parents and sister sat in the 
courtroom, supporting him.  The court asked Bautista a series of
questions regarding his right to be present in court.  Bautista 
consented to the arrangement, agreeing that the court could 
“conduct [the] sentencing hearing and impose sentence by video 
conference.”  See Hawaiʻ i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 
43(e)(3).  
After the colloquy, the court indicates it read the 
presentence diagnosis and report it had ordered per HRS § 706-
601 (2014 & Supp. 2016).  The court also reviewed supportive 
letters from Bautista’s family members, co-workers and 
supervisor at a Maui hotel.  Bautista’s wife writes: “The 
incident with [my husband] did not have any lasting effects on 
me.  The only effect it has had on our son is that his father is 
gone and he misses his father.  Please we ask for your help and 
kindness to lessen him years in jail.”  She adds, “This was the 
very first time he ever hit me. . . .  I don’t think he was 
serious that he wanted to kill me, he only said that because he 
thought I had a relationship with another man and he wanted to 
pressure me to admit it. . . .  I still love my husband and 
despite what happened that night I feel safe with him if he 
could be on probation and be given another chance.”*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 5 The court listens to the lawyers.  The prosecution wants 
consecutive sentences, an aggregate 15-year term of 
imprisonment.  Bautista wants probation. 
After the lawyers’ arguments, the court addresses Bautista: 
“Mr. Bautista, you know, what’s worse than a jealous man is a 
drunk, jealous man.  And that night you were drinking tequila, 
and you were drinking a lot of tequila, and you went off on your 
wife.”  The court describes the violent event and comments: “Your six-year-old, who was there the whole time, saw all this, 
saw all this.”  Bautista’s attorney interjects, clarifying that 
Bautista’s son only “saw the beginning of it from the living 
room.”  “Well, he saw a portion of it,” the court retorts.  The 
court expresses concern about the impacts to children who are 
present during acts of domestic violence.  Then the court says, 
“You know, there was no part of your wife’s body that was not 
untouched.”  The court describes her injuries: “facial 
bruising,” “a collapsed lung,” and a “fracture to not one rib but three different ribs.”  The court adds, “And I think the 
only reason you stopped was perhaps because your father was 
pounding on the front door.”  “[T]his gave an opportunity for 
your wife to get out of the house with the six-year-old, your 
son, to call a friend to pick her up, where she went to the 
police station that night and then later on to the hospital.” *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 6 Next, the court refers to a letter Bautista composed, “You 
know, Mr. Bautista, your statement to the Court that you wrote 
was: ‘I’d like to spread my wings, fly high again, and catch 
my . . . dreams.’”  Then the court remarks, “Sure sounds like a 
caged bird to me.  Well, I know Big Bird, Angry Birds, and 
jailbirds.  And you know what we do with jailbirds?”  “No,” 
answers Bautista.  “We clip their wings and we keep them locked 
up in cages.”   Then the court comments, “The Court is aware that I could 
possibly put you on probation or give you concurrent sentences, 
but the Court is aware that this is a very severe case.”  The 
court says it “considered all the sentencing options and 
alternatives,” and that it listened to Bautista’s attorney’s 
arguments, heard Bautista’s statement, and read the letters 
submitted by his family.  Bautista has no criminal record, the 
Court recognizes.  Next it says, “I think you were kind of like 
a -- this all pent up inside of you and exploded that night.”  “So these offenses are so serious you could have killed your 
wife. . . .  You know, she needs to protect you -- she needs to 
be protected.  Your son needs to be protected.  The community 
needs to be protected from this kind of behavior.”  The court 
mentions that Bautista’s wife feared for her life, “[a]nd though 
maybe now she has changed her tune, she thought that night that 
she was going to die.”  Then the court announces its sentence:   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 7 So the Court feels that there’s a need for respect for the 
law and you need to be justly punished and afford adequate 
deterrence to everyone.  Will five years protect her and 
your family?  I don’t think so.  Will ten years protect 
your wife and your family?  I don’t think so.  Will fifteen 
years protect your wife and your family?  Perhaps. 
 
 The court sentenced Bautista to consecutive five-year terms 
on each C felony count for a total of fifteen years.  Later, 
Bautista moved to reconsider.  The court denied that motion.  
Bautista appealed to the ICA.   
 On appeal, he initially, raised one issue - his sentence.  He argued that the circuit court imposed consecutive terms 
“without an adequate rationale” and that the sentence was “based 
in part on the dismissed charges.”  Later, Bautista amended his 
brief to include jurisdictional arguments.  Nearly one year 
after the filing of the opening brief, the ICA ordered 
supplemental briefing to address the potential impact of Obrero. 
 The ICA rejected Bautista’s jurisdiction and sentencing challenges.  It affirmed the circuit court. 
 Bautista applied for cert, and we accepted. 
III.  
A. 
 
 Without jurisdiction, a court has no power to act.  
“Jurisdiction is defined as the power and authority on the part of the court to hear and judicially determine and dispose of the 
cause pending before it.”  Schwartz v. State, 136 Hawaiʻ i
 258, 
262, 361 P.3d 1161, 1165 (2015) (cleaned up). *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 8  Bautista argues the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit 
lacks jurisdiction for two reasons.  First, unless there’s a 
circuit court charging document, this court’s precedent divests 
the circuit court of jurisdiction.  Second, Hawaiʻ i court rules 
require a 
circuit court complaint, not a district court 
complaint, to advance a case in circuit court. 
 Neither argument sways us.  The circuit court had 
jurisdiction. 
Chiefly citing State v. Kaulia, 128 Hawaiʻ i 479, 291 P.3d 
377 (2013) and Obrero, Bautista’s first argument maintains that 
“[t]he precedent established by this Court requires the prosecution to invoke the circuit court’s jurisdiction by filing 
a charging document in the circuit court.”  Bautista argues 
jurisdiction “must be averred in a charging document.”  One 
that’s filed in the court that actually hears and resolves the 
case. 
Kaulia doesn’t help Bautista.  There the State charged the 
defendant with a misdemeanor.  At his district court arraignment, Kaulia received a district court complaint, pled 
not guilty and demanded a jury trial.  The court committed the 
case to circuit court.  Later in circuit court, the State moved 
to amend the complaint, reducing the charge to a petty 
misdemeanor.  The court granted the motion.  Since the amended offense no longer permitted a jury trial, the circuit court *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 9 remanded to district court.  Down there, the State forgot to 
file the amended complaint.  Kaulia was convicted at a bench 
trial and appealed.  This court held that “[b]ecause the charge 
against Kaulia was not amended to a petty misdemeanor . . . , 
the district court lacked jurisdiction to proceed to trial.”  
Id. at 491, 291 P.3d at 389.  
Kaulia doesn’t resemble Bautista’s case for two reasons.   
First, in Kaulia the State failed to file an amended district 
court complaint.  No valid charging document re-established 
district court jurisdiction.  Instead, the original misdemeanor 
complaint was still in play.  That meant Kaulia retained his 
constitutional right to a jury trial, and the circuit court 
still had jurisdiction.  Id.  Bautista’s plight differs.  The 
State charged him with the identical (felony) offenses in district court that were later committed to circuit court.  Not 
only did his charges stay in circuit, they did not change when 
jurisdiction changed.  Kaulia’s did, and the district court could not invoke jurisdiction without a properly filed amended 
complaint.   
Second, Kaulia simply signals that the actual charges must 
be filed.  And in Bautista’s case they were.  The three counts 
he pled no contest to (assault in the second degree, terroristic 
threatening in the first degree, and abuse of a family household 
member in the presence of a minor) were all alleged in the *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 10 district court complaint.  The circuit court handled a case that 
involved offenses set forth in a filed charging instrument.  
Next, Bautista turns to Obrero for support.  He argues the 
case strips the circuit court of jurisdiction.  The State needs 
to “file a ‘cognizable’ charging instrument in the circuit 
court.”  He says, the “criminal proceedings in the circuit court 
do not start until the prosecutor files a charging document in 
the trial court.”  Bautista maintains the circuit court impermissibly “invoke[d] its own jurisdiction.”  It took a 
district court complaint and just called jurisdiction.  We 
disagree. 
Bautista misreads Obrero.  The circuit court has the power 
to act.  “The unlawfulness of the State’s prosecution did not 
deprive the circuit court of subject-matter jurisdiction.”  151 
at 478 n.12, 517 P.3d at 761 n.12.  Obrero gestures: 
Article VI, section 1 of Hawaiʻ i’s constitution gives the 
courts “original and appellate jurisdiction as provided by 
law.”  And under HRS § 603- 21.5(a)(1), the circuit courts 
have jurisdiction over “[c]riminal offenses cognizable 
under the laws of the State, committed within their 
respective circuits or transferred to them for trial by 
change of venue from some other circuit court.”  HRS § 603-
21.5(a)(1) (2016 & Supp. 2021).  Cognizable means capable of being known or recognized, or capable of being judicially tried or examined before a designated tribunal; 
within the court’s jurisdiction. 
 
Id. (cleaned up). 
Per Obrero, circuit courts have subject matter jurisdiction
over recognized criminal offenses.  Obrero does not mean the 
circuit court loses jurisdiction if the State fails to re-file a 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
11 complaint there.  Here the charging instrument alleges seven 
felonies, all cognizable, real-live offenses under Hawaiʻ i law.
Because the charges are actual crimes, capable of being 
recognized, they confer circuit court jurisdiction.    
Bautista misreads Obrero another way.  Because the State 
did not indict him, Bautista argues, “the prosecution is 
unlawful.”  Obrero held that charging a defendant with a felony 
by complaint, rather than through an indictment or information, 
violates HRS § 801-1.  Id. at 478, 517 P.3d at 761.  That’s what 
happened to him!  Bautista insists.  The State initiated felony 
charges through a district court complaint.  Without the correct 
charging instrument – indictment or information - his case never 
really existed.   
Like Bautista’s other Obrero-infused jurisdictional 
argument, dicta foretells the challenge: “[H]ad Obrero 
challenged the State’s failure to comply with HRS § 801-1 for 
the first time on appeal, we would presume the validity of the 
complaint against him and would not reverse his conviction 
absent a showing that the complaint prejudiced him or could not 
be construed to charge a crime.”  Id. at 478 n.11, 517 P.3d at 
761 n.11. (citing State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawaiʻ i 383 , 399, 219 
P.3d 1170, 1186 (2009).
This court may determine a decision’s retroactive impact.  
  200, 211, 29 P.3d 919, 930 (2001) See State v. Garcia, 96 Hawaiʻi  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
12 (explaining that “state courts generally have the authority to 
determine the retroactivity of their own decisions.” (quoting 
American Trucking Ass’ns, Inc. v. Smith, 496 U.S. 167, 177 
(1990))).
We hold that Obrero applies to cases that were pending 
trial before the decision.  Obrero does not apply retroactively 
to defendants who pled out or to defendants convicted after a 
trial.  So defendants awaiting sentencing, or those challenging 
a charging instrument’s validity for the first time on appeal 
(like Bautista) or even later per HRPP Rule 40, are foreclosed 
from having their pleas nullified or their trial convictions 
overturned per HRS § 801-1. 
Obrero signals that a retroactive effect based on the 
timing of an HRS § 801-1 challenge is an appealing outcome.  
First, it aligns with the interests of justice – vacating 
virtually every conviction initiated by a felony complaint does 
not.  Second, it matters that sentenced and pre-sentence 
defendants understood the “nature and cause of the action” and 
were convicted of recognizable crimes.  An existential argument 
about the prosecution never really happening because of HRS 
§801-1 non-compliance ignores constitutional compliance.  See
the United States Constitution.  Third, the approach closely
aligns with our unlawful charging instrument cases.  See e.g.Hawaiʻi Constitution article I, section 14, Sixth Amendment to*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
13 Wheeler, 121 Hawaiʻ i at 399-400, 219 P.3d at 1186-87 (ruling that
court will not reverse a conviction based upon a defective 
charging document unless the defendant shows prejudice or the 
document cannot within reason be construed to charge a crime).   
We turn to Bautista’s rules-based jurisdictional argument.  
Bautista repeats that once the district court finds probable 
cause and sets bail, the prosecution must file a charging 
document in the circuit court to invoke that court’s 
jurisdiction.  Otherwise, the court breaks the rules.  The rules 
don’t allow a district court complaint to control what happens 
in circuit court.
The Hawaiʻ i Rules of Penal Procedure roadmap a felony case’s 
migration from district to circuit court.  “A complaint may be filed in 
either the district or circuit court; provided that a 
complaint shall not be filed initially in the circuit court when 
it charges: (i) a felony, and none of the 3 conditions set forth 
in Rule 7(b) of these rules has yet occurred, or (ii) only an 
offense or offenses other than a felony.”  HRPP Rule 7(h)(2) 
(emphases added).   
In turn, HRPP Rule 7(b) lists three conditions to prosecute 
a felony by complaint: if a district judge finds probable cause 
at a preliminary hearing, the defendant waives the right to a 
hearing, or the defendant waives the right to an indictment. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 14 After the State files a complaint alleging felonies in 
district court, that court makes a probable cause determination. 
That is, unless the State later indicts the defendant or files a 
felony information.  See HRS § 805-7 (2014).  Here, the State 
did not indict or file a felony information.  And Bautista did 
not waive indictment or preliminary hearing per HRPP Rule 7(b).  
The district court held a preliminary hearing and found probable 
cause to support all charges.  
Then, HRPP Rule 5(c)’s transmit-the-evidence-and-documents 
to circuit court provisions kick in. “If the defendant is held to answer in the circuit court, the court shall transmit to the 
circuit court all papers and articles received in evidence at 
the preliminary hearing and any bail received by it.”  HRPP Rule 
5(c)(6).  HRPP Rule 5(c)(7) directs that the district court 
clerk “shall transmit to the circuit court all documents in the 
proceeding.”  
Bautista argues HRPP Rule 7(h)(2) “contemplates that after 
a preliminary hearing and commitment, the prosecution must then file a complaint alleging felony offenses in the circuit court 
or initiate proceedings with an indictment or felony 
information.”  But nothing in HRPP Rule 7 (or anywhere) backs 
Bautista. 
No rule requires the State to file a second complaint in 
circuit court.  It’s plain, “[a] complaint may be filed in *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 15 either the district or circuit court.”  HRPP Rule 7(h)(2) 
(emphasis added).  Also, there’s no requirement in chapters 805 
and 806, covering criminal procedure in district court and 
circuit court, to refile a complaint after commitment from 
district court. 
There is no basis in Hawaiʻ i law to conclude that the 
circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.   
B. 
 We go to Bautista’s sentencing challenge. 
 We hold that the circuit court inadequately justified 
Bautista’s consecutive sentences.  The court erred by not 
articulating a clear and comprehensive rationale for each consecutive sentence. 
 Sentencing courts have broad discretion.  The “standard of 
review for sentencing or resentencing matters is whether the 
court committed plain and manifest abuse of discretion in its 
decision.”  State v. Barrios, 139 Hawaiʻ i
 321, 328, 389 P.3d 916, 
923 (2016).  This review standard, though, doesn’t hand 
appellate courts a rubber-stamp, especially when it comes to a 
consecutive sentence.  
 A trial court considers many factors at every sentencing
hearing.  See HRS § 706-606 (2014) (key factors are “[t]he 
nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant.”)  Absent clear evidence to 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 16 the contrary, it is presumed that a sentencing court will have 
considered all factors before imposing concurrent or consecutive
terms of imprisonment under HRS § 706-606.  State v. Hussein, 
122 Hawaiʻ i 495, 518, 229 P.3d 313, 336 (2010).  
 Concurrent sentences are the default.  Under HRS § 706-
668.5(1) (Supp. 2015), “where a defendant is convicted of 
multiple offenses, there exists a presumption that ‘[m]ultiple 
terms of imprisonment run concurrently, unless the court orders 
or the [applicable] statute mandates that the terms run 
consecutively.’”  Lewi v. State, 145 Hawaiʻ i 333, 350, 452 P.3d 
330, 347 (2019).  The sentencing court must adequately 
distinguish between the need for consecutive sentences and the 
sentence a defendant “would have received under the presumption 
of concurrent sentencing.”  Id. at 351, 452 P.3d at 348. 
 A sentencing court must provide “a meaningful rationale to 
the defendant, the victim, and the public.”  Hussein, 122 Hawaiʻ i 
at 509, 229 P.3d at 327.  Courts “must state on the record at 
the time of sentencing the reasons for imposing a consecutive sentence.”  Id. at 510, 229 P.3d at 328. 
 Even if a court uses identical factors to support multiple consecutive sentences, it must “specify [the] basis or identify 
another basis for determining how many consecutive sentences to 
 
stresses the importance of identifying the rationale for each impose.”  Barrios, 139  at 337, 389 P.3d at 932.  Barrios Hawaiʻi*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 17 consecutive sentence: “a clearly articulated rationale is 
necessary when there is a large disparity between the maximum 
statutory sentence for each offense and the aggregate 
consecutive sentence imposed by the court.”  Id. at 338, 389 
P.3d at 933.  In Sandoval, this court reinforced that stringent
standard, requiring courts to provide clearly articulated 
reasons for “each and every consecutive sentence.”  State v. 
Sandoval, 149 Hawaiʻ i 221, 236, 487 P.3d 308, 323 (2021) 
(emphasis added).  
The circuit court did not follow these directives.  It gave 
a suboptimal explanation for each consecutive sentence.  
To recap, before the court rules on the State’s motion for 
consecutive sentencing, it expresses legitimate concern about 
the impact on Bautista’s son of viewing the violence.  And it 
describes the physical harm Bautista caused to his wife.  Then, 
after the “clip their wings and put them in cages” quip, the 
court says it looked at the sentencing factors and “considered 
all the sentencing options and alternatives.”  The court 
acknowledges that Bautista has no prior record.  But otherwise 
it overlooks Bautista’s history and characteristics. 
 Bautista asked for a probationary sentence.  It fit HRS 
§ 706-606’s statutory criteria and satisfied the interests of 
justice.  The court disagreed.  It imposed consecutive 
sentences.  15 years.  
The court explained its rationale: *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
18 So the Court feels that there’s a need for respect for the 
law and you need to be justly punished and afford adequate 
deterrence to everyone.  Will five years protect her and 
your family?  I don’t think so.  Will ten years protect 
your wife and your family?  I don’t think so.  Will fifteen 
years protect your wife and your family?  Perhaps. 
This is not enough.  A court’s rationale must be tethered 
to each consecutive sentence.  The court acted as if it were 
sentencing Bautista on one count with a potential range of 0 to 
15 years.  The court did not communicate “a rational basis for 
each consecutive sentence that it imposed.”  Barrios, 139 Hawaiʻ i 
at 337, 389 P.3d at 932.  It “did not sufficiently explain its 
decision to impose multiple consecutive sentences.”  Id.  Courts 
must give substantial and pointed reasons to justify a 
consecutive sentence.  Reciting sentencing factors and offense 
circumstances may sometimes work for a concurrent sentencing 
disposition.  However, it does not justify running a sentence 
consecutively.  
The court gave Bautista the maximum aggregate sentence.  
But it offered no rationale for each consecutive sentence.  The 
court focused almost entirely on the criminal incident itself.  
The court did not distinguish the three offenses, class C 
felonies carrying a 5-year maximum sentence, and instead treated 
them as one offense.  
Barrios involved different events and multiple victims.  
Id. at 325, 389 P.3d at 920.  So did a recent case, State v. 
Perry, 153 Hawaiʻ i 185, 187, 528 P.3d 524, 526 (2023) (affirming  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
19 consecutive sentences for two separate murders, committed days 
apart in the same criminal case).  As did Hussein.  122 Hawaiʻ i
at 498-99, 229 P.3d at 316-17.  Sandoval too.  It involved 
consecutive sentences for separate instances of harassment with
multiple victims.  149 Hawaiʻ i at 226, 487 P.3d at 313.  
 
The “nature and circumstances” of same event, same victim 
cases are different from multiple event cases with multiple 
victims.  See Perry, 153 Hawaiʻ i at 190, 528 P.3d at 529. 
Stacking sentences after merely reciting a case’s circumstances 
is an abuse of discretion.  “[A] sentencing court should explain 
its rationale for each consecutive sentence in order to inform 
the defendant and appellate courts of the specific factors 
underlying each sentence.”  Barrios, 139 Hawaiʻ i at 337, 389 P.3d 
at 932.  Here, rather than explaining each sentence, the court 
merely talked about the incident and commented that fifteen 
years of imprisonment may protect the Bautista family.  A 
consecutive sentence is a severe sentence.  Our law requires a 
court to do much more than express a desire to clip a person’s 
wings, and put them in a cage. 
IV. 
We vacate the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal related to 
sentencing, and vacate the circuit court’s Judgment, Conviction  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 20 and Sentence related to sentencing.  We remand to the circuit 
court for resentencing.
