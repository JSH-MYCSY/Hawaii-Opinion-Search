WALTER N. GUITY,  
Petitioner/Petitioner-Appellant,  
 
vs.  
 
STATE OF HAWAIʻI,   
Respondent/Respondent-Appellee.  
CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS   
(CAAP-21-0000531; CIVIL NO. 1CCV-21-0000629)   
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., McKenna, Eddins, and Devens, JJ., 
and Circuit Judge Cataldo in place of Ginoza, J., recused) 
Petitioner Walter N. Guity filed a petition in the 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court) under Hawai‘i 
Revised Statutes (HRS) chapter 661B (2016) for redress for 
wrongful conviction and imprisonment related to two vacated 
convictions of sexual assault.  The circuit court,1 upon a motion 
from the Respondent State of Hawai‘i, dismissed Guity’s petition 
as to both convictions. Guity appealed, and the Intermediate 
1 The Honorable Jeffrey P. Crabtree presided.  
 
 
   ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Court of Appeals (ICA) held that “Guity’s petition satisfied the  
pleading requirements of HRS § 661B-1(b)(1) as to one of his 
convictions, but not the other.” Guity v. State, 153 Hawai‘i 
368, 370, 538 P.3d 780, 782 (App. 2023) (Guity III).  At the 
time of Guity’s application for writ of certiorari, this court 
had not yet adjudicated the pleading requirements of HRS  
§ 661B-1(b)(1) (2016).  Having recently done so in   Jardine v. 
State, 155 Hawai‘ i 60, 556 P.3d 406 (2024), we now affirm the 
ICA’s holding in the instant case.   
On May 18, 2011, Guity entered a global plea agreement 
in the circuit court related to criminal charges in two separate   
cases, one in the family district court (family court case) and the other in the circuit court (circuit court case).    The 
charges in the two cases arose from separate incidents of alleged sexual assault. The facts in the underlying criminal 
cases are recited in  State v. Guity, 139 
Hawai‘i 272, 398 P.3d 
901, 2016 WL 6427681, at *2 (App. Oct. 31, 2016) (mem. op.)  
(Guity I) and  State v. Guity, 144 Hawai‘ i 557, 445  P.3d 138 
(2019) (
Guity II). 
As part of the plea agreement, Guity pleaded guilty to  
second-degree sexual assault in the circuit court case and 
third-degree sexual assault in the family court case.    Guity II, 
144 Hawai‘i at 55  9, 445 P.3d at 140.   The complaining witness in 
the family court case was Guity’s spouse. Id.  at 558-59,   
2  
 
 
   ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
445 P.3d at 139-40.   At the time of Guity’s guilty plea, an 
offense against one’s spouse was expressly excluded from the  
offense of third-degree sexual assault.  See  HRS § 707-732(1)(f) 
(Supp. 2009); HRS § 707-700 (Supp. 2009).    Thus, it was legally 
impossible for Guity to have committed the offense to which he 
pleaded guilty in the family court case.  Guity I, 2016 WL 
6427681, at *8.  
Subsequent to his plea, Guity became dissatisfied with 
his attorney, who ultimately withdrew as Guity’s counsel.   Guity 
II, 144 Hawai‘i a t 559, 445 P.3d at 140.  Proceeding pro se   
before the circuit court, Guity orally moved to withdraw his 
guilty pleas in both cases. Id.   The circuit court denied 
Guity’s motion and, pursuant to the plea agreement, sentenced  
him to concurrent terms of twelve months of imprisonment in the   
family court case and eighteen months of imprisonment in the    
circuit court case. Id. 
at 560, 445 P.3d at 141. 
Guity appealed his convictions. This court held that  
Guity should have been allowed to withdraw his guilty plea in 
the family court case because “the Circuit Court definitively 
knew that it was legally impossible for Guity to have committed”  
the offense of third-degree sexual assault against his spouse.   
Id.  at 562-63, 445 P.3d at 143-44 (citation omitted).   Further, 
because the pleas in both cases were part of a single agreement, 
we held that Guity “was entitled to withdraw his plea in the 
3  
 
 
  
 ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
circuit court case.” Id.  at 563, 445 P.3d at 144. Accordingly, 
we remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings with 
instructions to accept Guity’s withdrawal of both pleas.  Id.  at 
563-64, 445 P.3d at 144-45.  By that time, however, Guity had already served the entirety of his concurrent sentence.   Both 
cases were ultimately dismissed on remand.    Guity III, 153 
Hawai‘i at 370-71 , 538 P.3d at 782-83.  
  
On May 14, 2021, Guity filed a civil petition in 
circuit court seeking redress for wrongful conviction and  
imprisonment under HRS chapter 661B.   The State moved to dismiss 
his petition on the grounds that Guity failed to meet the pleading requirements of HRS § 661B-1(b)(1), which require a 
petitioner to allege that they were “actually innocent” of the 
crimes for which they were convicted.
   The circuit court granted 
the State’s motion to dismiss.    Guity appealed.  2
2   HRS § 661B- 1(b) provides:  
 
(b)   To present an actionable claim against the State for 
wrongful conviction and imprisonment, the petitioner shall 
allege that the petitioner was convicted of one or more crimes under the laws of the State, was subsequently 
sentenced to a term of imprisonment, and has served all or 
any part of the sentence and either that:  
(1)  The judgment of conviction was reversed or vacated because the petitioner was actually 
innocent  of the crimes for which the petitioner 
was convicted, and the court decision so states; or  
(2)  The petitioner was pardoned because the petitioner was actually innocent of the crimes for which the petitioner was convicted and the 
pardon so states.  
(Emphasis added).

 ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
On appeal, the ICA held that Guity’s petition  
satisfied the pleading requirements as to the family court case 
but not the circuit court case.   Guity III, 153 Hawai‘i at 376 -
77, 538 P.3d at 788-89.    Reviewing the appellate court decisions 
that had vacated Guity’s family court conviction, the ICA 
acknowledged that Guity I  stated “there was no factual basis  
(because the complaining witness was Guity’s wife) or legal basis (because the definition of ‘sexual contact’ excluded 
contact with the defendant’s spouse) for Guity’s conviction.” 
Id.  at 376, 538 P.3d at 788. Further, Guity II  “noted it was 
legally impossible for Guity to have committed the offense to 
which he pleaded guilty in the Family Court Case.”  Id.   Read in 
conjunction with the requirements of HRS § 661B-1(b)(1), the ICA held that these pronouncements were equivalent to a statement  
that Guity was “actually innocent.”   Id.  
The same was not true in the circuit court case, where 
the complainant was someone other than Guity’s spouse.  There, Guity’s conviction was vacated on a purely procedural issue: he  
should have been able to withdraw his guilty plea.   Guity II, 
144 
Hawai‘i at 563, 445 P.3d at 144.  On remand, the circuit 
court case was dismissed with prejudice because of defects in the indictment and the State’s lack of contact with the 
complainant. Guity III, 153 Hawai‘ i at 377, 538 P.3d at 789.   
Accordingly, the ICA concluded that nothing in the supreme 
5  
 
 
  
 ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
court’s opinion or circuit court’s subsequent order could be 
reasonably interpreted as a statement of Guity’s actual 
innocence. Id.   Thus, neither of those decisions could “be 
relied on as the decision stating that Guity was actually innocent for the purposes of HRS § 661B-1(b)(1).”  Id.  
Guity filed the instant application for certiorari on  
December 8, 2023.
3   At the time of his filing, this court had not 
yet adjudicated the meaning of “actual innocence.”     We have now 
done so through Jardine v. State, 155 Hawai‘ i 60, 556 P.3d 406 
(2024).   In Jardine, we wrote:   
We agree with the ICA’s reasoning in Guity v. State, 153 
Hawai‘i  368, 376, 538 P.3d 780, 788 (App. 2023) that the 
words “actual innocence” need not appear in the order 
reversing or vacating a petitioner’s conviction for a 
petitioner to survive summary judgment as to their eligibility for relief under HRS § 661B- 1(b)(1).  
Id.  at 70, 556 P.3d at 416.  
We further held that under HRS § 661B-1, “a petitioner  
must show that their conviction was vacated based on evidence of 
3   Guity filed an initial application for writ of certiorari on 
November 13, 2023, before the ICA had entered its judgment on appeal.  We 
dismissed that application without prejudice to re- filing pursuant to Hawai‘ i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 40.1 (eff. 2023).  
 We 
also note that Guity’s instant application i s not compliant 
with the content requirements of HRAP Rule 40.1(d), and a strict application 
of that rule would require that Guity’s application be disregarded. However, 
“we believe that pro se litigants should not automatically have their access 
to appellate review in this court foreclosed because of failure to conform to 
requirements of the procedural rules.” Erum v. Llego, 147 Hawai‘ i 368, 381, 
465 P.3d 815, 828 (2020). Further, this court “has long adhered to the 
policy of affording litigants the opportunity to be heard on the merits 
whenever possible[,] ” and is “obligated to interpret applications for 
certiorari liberally in order to facilitate access to justice.” Id.  at 380-
81, 465 P.3d 827- 28 (citing  Morgan v. Plan.  Dep’t, 104 Hawai
‘i 173, 180- 81, 86 
P.3d 982, 989- 90 (2004);  Waltrip v. TS Enters., Inc., 140 Hawai‘ i 226, 240, 
398 P.3d 815, 829 (2016)).

innocence, rather than a technical or procedural issue.”  Id. at 
73, 556 P.3d at 419. 
Consistent with the discussion above and our opinion 
in Jardine, we conclude that Guity’s petition met the pleading 
requirements of HRS § 661B-1(b)(1) with respect to the family 
court case but failed to do so with respect to the circuit court 
case.  We therefore affirm the ICA’s November 14, 2023 Judgment 
on Appeal and remand the case to the circuit court for further 
proceedings consistent with this order.
