CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS  
 
ORDER  DENYING MOTION  FOR RECONSIDERATION  
(By: McKenna,  J.)  
On July 17, 2024, Petitioner/Defendant -Appellant Celeste M. 
Gonsalves filed a document entitled, “ Defendant -Appellant’s 
Motion to Request Instructions ,” in which she asks this court to 
reconsider the May 24, 2024 order rejecting her application for 
writ of certiorari. A rejection of an application for writ of   
 
 
    
  
   
 certiorari, however, is not subject to reconsideration. See  
Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure (“HRAP”) Rule 40.1(h) 
(“Neither acceptance nor rejection of an application for a writ 
of certiorari shall be subject to a motion for reconsideration 
in the supreme court. The rejection of an application for 
certiorari shall be final.”) .   Accordingly,  
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion for reconsideration is 
denied. 
DATED:   Honolulu, Hawaiʻi, July  18, 2024.

Associate Justice
