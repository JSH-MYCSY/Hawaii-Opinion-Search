2 (Petitioner)  asserts that the Intermediate Court of Appeals 
(ICA) erred when it dismissed  the appeal for lack of 
jurisdiction .  According to the  ICA, the order appealed from 
does not constitute a n appealable  final order .   
  However, Petitioner’s motion that requested  leave to 
appeal a cknowledged that the order was not a n appealable final 
order, and instead sought an appeal under the preliminary ruling 
language of Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (HRS)  § 91-14(a) (Supp. 
2016).1  The Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board (LIRAB) 
granted this request.    
 For the reasons discussed below,  we hold that the ICA 
erred when it dismissed this appeal for lack of jurisdiction .  
We thus vacate the ICA’s  November 3, 2022 dismissal order and  
remand this appeal to the ICA for further consideration.  
I. 
Petitioner reported a work -related injury on 
December  18, 2006, claiming that her injury occurred  while 
 
1  HRS § 91 -14(a) states in pertinent part:  
 
(a) Any person aggrieved by a final decision 
and order in a contested case or by a preliminary 
ruling of the nature that deferral of review pending 
entry of a subsequent final decision  would deprive 
appellant  of adequate  relief is entitled to judicial 
review thereof under this chapter; but nothing in 
this section shall be deemed to prevent resort to 
other means of review, redress, relief, or trial de 
novo, including the right of trial by jury, provided 
by law. 
 
(Emphasis added .) *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
3 employed as a registered nurse with her  employer,  
Respondent/Employer -Appellee -Appellee  American Healthways Inc . 
(Employer).   The date of th is injury was November 28, 2006.  
Following a  March 30, 2007  independent medical 
examination (IME), Petitioner alleged her left forearm was 
injured during this IME.  
At a hearing held on September 6, 2007,  in the 
Disability Compensation Division of the Department of Labor and 
Industrial Relations (DCD),  Petitioner claimed she also 
sustained a neck injury and sleep disorder due to the March 30, 
2007 IME.  
On October 24, 2 007, the Director of the DCD 
(Director) determined that Petitioner  sustained compensable 
work-related injuries , but denied Petitioner’s claim  for 
compensation relating to her alleged  neck injury and sleep 
disorder.  
Petitioner appealed the Director’s decision to the 
LIRAB.  The consolidated cases consist of the Director’s 
Decisions concerning the November 28, 2006 injury (2 -06-14727) 
and March 30, 2007 injury during the IME (2 -07-04617). 
Following years of further proceedings before the 
LIRAB and DCD , on July 24, 2018, the LIRAB filed a Third Amended 
Pretrial Order that specified six issues to be addressed, which 
included:  (1) Whether Petitioner sustained a personal injury *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
4 involving her neck on March 30, 2007, arising out of and in the 
course of employment; and (2) whether Petitioner sustained or 
suffered a sleep disorder injury or condition on or about March 
30, 2007, arising out of and in the course of employment.  
On November 9, 2021, Petitioner was notified that she 
was scheduled for two additional  IMEs, each with a different 
doctor. 
On November 18, 2021, Employer  and Respondent/  
Insurance Carrier -Appellee -Appellee St. Paul Travelers 
(Employer/ Insurance Carrier ) filed two second amended motions to 
compel Petitioner’s attendance at these two  IMEs. 
On December 2, 2021, Petitioner filed a memo in 
opposition to Employer/Insurance Carrier’s two second amended 
motions to compel and a motion for partial summary judgment.  
Petitioner’s opposition object ed to having to undergo another 
round of IMEs  because good cause did not exist pursuant to 
HRS § 386-79 (Supp. 2017) . 
On December 17, 2021, Employer/Insurance Carrier filed 
a reply that asserted that these two IMEs “are proper and good 
cause exists as provided in HRS § 386 -79” because  one IME was to 
examine Petitioner’s “alleged neck pain  for purposes of this 
appeal” before the LIRAB , and the other IME was to examine 
Petitioner’s “alleged sleep disorder  for purposes of this 
appeal” before the LIRAB.   Employer/Insurance Carrier’s reply *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
5 relied on HRS § 386 -79(b), which states that an employer is 
limited to one IME per case “unless good and valid reasons exist 
with regard to the medical progress of employee’s treatment.”   
On December 28, 2021, the LIRAB filed an order 
granting Employer/In surance Carrier’s two motions to compel and 
denying Petitioner’s motion for partial summary judgment.   
On January 6, 2022, Petitioner filed a request for 
reconsideration or, alternatively, a request for “judicial 
review.”  Petitioner filed an addendum to this request on 
January 7, 2022.  In pertinent part, Petitioner acknowledged 
that the December 28, 2021 order was not a final appealable 
order, but sought judicial review under HRS § 91 -14(a) because 
“deferral of review pending entry of a subsequent final decision 
would deprive [Petitioner] of adequate relief .” 
On February 8, 2022, the LIRAB filed an order that 
denied Petitioner’s request for reconsideration, but granted her 
request for judicial review.  This order said:  “Claimant’s 
pleading filed January 6, 2022 shall be considered an appeal of 
the [LIRAB’s] December 28, 2021 order.”  
B. 
Petitioner ’s notice of appeal  was filed  on February 9, 
2022, and  consists of (1) Petitioner’s  January 6, 2022 request 
for reconsideration or, in the alternative, for judici al review *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
6 that was filed in the LIRAB, (2) the LIRAB’s December 28, 2021 
order, and (3) the LIRAB’s February 8, 2022 order.  
  On November 3, 2022, the ICA filed an order dismissing  
the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction because the 
LIRAB’s December 28, 2021 order does not constitute a final 
decision and order under HRS §§ 386 -88 and 91 -14(a).  The ICA 
explained:  
 Here, the [December 28, 2021] Order:  directs 
[Petitioner]  to submit to medical examinations to 
ascertain the extent of her purported neck injury, 
declines to entertain her request for partial summary 
judgment, and denies her request for sanctions.  It 
does not end the LIRAB proceedings, leaving nothing 
further t o be accomplished, nor does it finally 
adjudicate any matter of medical and temporary 
disability benefits . 
 
On January 3, 2023 , Petitioner  timely2 filed an 
application  for writ of certiorari that asserts that the ICA  had 
jurisdiction under HRS § 91 -14(a) to review the LIRAB’s December 
28, 2021 IME order and the ICA’s decision is inconsistent with 
Tam v. Kaiser Permanente , 94 Hawaiʻi 487, 17 P.3d 219 (2001) .3   
We agree.   
 
2  Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP)  Rule 40.1(a)(1)  (2022) 
allows a party to file a certiorari application “within 30 days after the 
filing of the [ICA’s] . . . dismissal order[.]”   See HRS § 602 -59(c) (Supp. 
2017) (same).  Petitioner timely requested a thirty-day extension of time to 
file the certiorari application  on November 7, 2022 .  See HRS § 602 -59(c); 
HRAP Rule 40.1(a)(3)  (2022).  January 2, 2023, was the New Year’s holiday.  
See HRAP Rule 26(a) (2022) (instructing that holidays are excluded from the 
computat ion of time).

7 II. 
In Tam, the Director suspended the claimant’s workers’ 
compensation benefits because the claimant refused to appear for 
an IME.  94 Hawaiʻi at 492-93, 17 P.3d at 224 -25.  The LIRAB 
affirmed the Director’s decision.  Id. at 493, 17 P.3d at 225.  
In addressing the jurisdiction issue, this court said:  
 [A]lthough the LIRAB ’s decision does not end 
the proceedings in Tam ’s case, it is clear that 
“deferral of review pending entry of a subsequent 
final decision would deprive appellant of adequate 
relief.”  In fact, no relief is or will be available 
to Tam with respect to her challenge to the 
present suspension of her workers ’ compensation 
benefits absent this court ’s review.   Of course, Tam 
could comply with the Director ’s order and thereby 
have her benefits restored, but it is precisely the 
validity of that order and her right to ignore it 
that she asks this court to review in the present 
appeal.  Given the parties ’ positions, and 
particularly Tam ’s claim that the order was unlawful, 
the option of complying with the Director's order is 
not “adequate relief.”  Accordingly, pursuant to HRS 
§ 91–14(a), we have jurisdiction over the present 
appeal. 
 
Id. at 494-95, 17 P.3d at 226 -27. 
Later, i n Gour v. Honsador Lumber, LLC , 134 Hawaiʻi 99, 
101, 332 P.3d 701, 70 3 (App. 2014) , the Director deferred 
determination of the claimant’s compensation claim until the 
claimant complied with the  ordered IME.  On appeal to the LIRAB, 
the LIRAB dismissed the appeal on the ground that there was no 
appealable decision or final order because compensability 
remained undetermined.  Id.  Contrary to the LIRAB’s decision , 
the ICA relied on Tam to hold that the LIRAB had jurisdiction to 
consider the merits of the claimant’s appeal, as follows:  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
8 Based on  Tam, we conclude that the LIRAB was 
required to exercise jurisdiction over Gour ’s appeal 
because the LIRAB ’s failure to revie w the Director's 
Decision until the entry of a final decision on 
Gour’s entitlement to benefits will deprive Gour of 
adequate relief.  Similar to the circumstances 
in Tam, Gour wants to challenge the validity of the 
Director ’s order compelling him to under go an 
independent psychological examination in his appeal 
to the LIRAB.   No adequate relief with respect to 
this challenge will be available to Gour if the LIRAB 
refuses to consider his challenge on the merits until 
he undergoes the psychological examinati on.  As 
in Tam, Gour could comply with the Director ’s order 
to undergo the psychological examination and thereby 
end the deferral imposed on the determination of his 
workers’ compensation claim.  But this would require 
Gour to submit to the very psychological examination 
he claims is unjustified and was not ordered “in 
accordance with the law[,]” and to comply with the 
order of the Director for which he seeks review.  
 
Id. at 103, 332 P.3d at 705.  
Here, the ICA’s November 3, 2022 dismissal order 
relied on the final order language of HRS § 91 -14(a) and case 
law applying  that language.  However, Petitioner’s request to 
pursue judicial review, which the LIRAB granted, acknowledged 
that the appeal would be  from a preliminary ruling under HRS § 
91-14(a), and not a final order.  
An order compelling a claimant to undergo an IME is 
sufficient to constitu te the deprivation of adequate relief that 
is required u nder the preliminary ruling language of  HRS § 91-
14(a).  See Tam, 94 Hawaiʻi at 494-95, 17 P.3d at 22 6-27; Gour, 
134 Hawaiʻi at 103, 332 P.3d at 705 .  As such, the ICA should not 
have dismissed this appeal for lack of jurisdiction . *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

III. 
  Based on the above , the ICA’s November 3, 2022 
dismissal order is vacated and this appeal is remanded to the 
ICA for further consideration .
