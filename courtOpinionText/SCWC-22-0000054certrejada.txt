 STATEMENT OF CIRCUIT JUDGE CRABTREE 
 
I respectfully note that the termination of Father’s 
paternal rights is entirely separate from the issue of whether 
A.O. can be placed with Father’s family in California, as 
recognized by the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) and the 
Department of Human Services.  (See note 9 of the ICA’s Summary 
Disposition Order.) 
  DATED: Honolulu, Hawai‘ i, July 5, 2023.
