CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
(CAAP-22-0000129 and CAAP-21-0000278 (consolidated); 
CR. NO. 1PC151000488) 
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Circuit Judge Castagnetti, in place of 
Ginoza, J., recused, and Circuit Judge Chang, in place of 
Devens, J., recused, with McKenna, J. dissenting, with whom 
Eddins, J., joins) 
I. INTRODUCTION 
This appeal arises from Patrick H. Oki’s conviction 
and sentence for fraudulently obtaining money from a local 
accounting firm. Oki was convicted of three counts of first-
degree theft, one count of second-degree theft, three counts of 
money laundering, two counts of use of a computer in the  
 
  
 
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
commission of the thefts in the first degree charged in counts 2 
and 3 (sometimes “use of a computer” or “counts 8 and 9”), and 
four counts of second-degree forgery. He was sentenced to 
twenty years of incarceration for the use of a computer counts -
the longest of his sentences, all of which were to be served 
concurrently. Oki was also ordered to pay restitution of 
$440,158.54, pursuant to statute during his incarceration, and 
at a rate of at least $30 per month after his release. 
In his application for writ of certiorari, Oki raises 
three issues. 
First, Oki challenges his convictions for use of a 
computer in the commission of a separate theft in counts 8 and 9 as illegal because after he was charged with the offenses, but 
before his trial and sentencing, the statutory subsection under 
which he was convicted was repealed. The act repealing the 
subsection, Act 231, contained a savings clause, which provided 
in relevant part, “[t]his Act does not affect rights and duties that matured, penalties that were incurred, and proceedings that 
were begun before its effective date.” 2016 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 
231, § 70 at 775. 
Second, Oki challenges the payment schedule in his 
restitution order. The Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) held 
that Oki waived any challenge to the time and manner of 
restitution payment. Oki disagrees and requests this court 
2  
 
  
  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
clarify the difference between waiver, which forecloses plain 
error review, and forfeiture, under which plain error review 
still applies. Oki further contends that the circuit court’s 
restitution payment schedule was plainly erroneous because it 
failed to consider Oki’s ability to pay in setting the manner 
and time of payment pursuant to Hawai‘ i Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§ 706-646(3) (Supp. 2017). 
Third, Oki argues the ICA erroneously held that its 
remand mandate in a prior appeal by Oki “precluded” the circuit 
court from revisiting the amount of restitution on remand. The 
circuit court had initially ordered Oki to pay restitution to 
the firm, including, but not limited to, four of his former partners in their capacity as partners; the ICA vacated as to 
that order only and remanded to the circuit court with 
directions to order restitution directly to the firm itself. On 
remand, Oki filed a motion for a restitution hearing and study, 
arguing that the circuit court needed to recalculate restitution 
entirely because the record lacked evidence of the victim’s 
“reasonable and verified losses” pursuant to HRS § 706-646(2) (2014). The circuit court denied the motion. 
We resolve Oki’s issues as follows. With respect to 
the first issue, this case requires a straightforward 
application of our precedent in State v. Reis
, 115 Hawai‘i 79, 
165 P.3d 980 (2007). There, we interpreted a savings clause 
3  
 
  
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
that contained the same language as Act 231, which is at issue 
here. We concluded that the defendant in Reis did not get the 
benefit of the ameliorative amendments contained in the 
applicable statute, because (1) her prosecution had begun before 
the effective date of the statute, and (2) she had committed the 
crime — and thus “incurred” the penalty — before that date. 
Those are exactly the same circumstances as Oki. Therefore, we 
affirm Oki’s convictions for use of a computer in the commission of a separate theft because the “proceedings” of his case began 
before Act 231’s effective date, and he also committed the 
crimes before those crimes were statutorily repealed. 
Second, the ICA correctly concluded that Oki waived 
his claim as to the restitution payment schedule, and the 
circuit court’s restitution payment schedule was not plainly 
erroneous. Contrary to Oki’s contention, the circuit court 
expressly considered Oki’s ability to pay in setting the manner 
and time of payment pursuant to HRS § 706-646(3). 
Finally, the ICA did not hold that its remand mandate 
“precluded” the circuit court from reconsidering the restitution amount on remand; rather, the ICA correctly held that the 
circuit court did not err in denying Oki’s motion for a 
restitution hearing and study. The restitution amount had 
already been determined based on the “reasonable and verified 
losses” of the accounting firm and the circuit court’s decision 
4  
 
   
 
 
   
  
   
 
    *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
“closely adhere[d]” to the true intent and meaning of the ICA’s 
remand mandate. See HRS § 706-646(2); In re Haw. Elec. Light 
Co. (In re HELCO), 149 Hawai‘ i 239, 241, 487 P.3d 708, 710 
(2021). 
We therefore affirm the ICA. 
II. BACKGROUND 
A. Factual Background 
Oki’s charges are based on his alleged conduct 
carrying out four fraudulent schemes between 2011 and 2014 as managing principal partner of local accounting firm Spire 
Hawai‘i, LLP (Spire), formerly PKF Pacific Hawai‘ i
 , LLP (PKF). 
State v. Oki (
Oki I), No. CAAP-18-0000501, 2020 WL 3027401, at 
*1 (Haw. App. June 5, 2020) (mem. op.). Oki’s former partners 
at Spire, Lawrence Chew, Deneen Nakashima, Dwayne Takeno, and Trisha Nomura (collectively, “former partners”) began to suspect 
Oki of stealing money from PKF and reported him to the police in 
2014. Id.
B. Initial Circuit Court Trial Proceedings
1 
On April 1, 2015, Oki was indicted for thirteen 
charges: three counts of Theft in the First Degree, in violation 
of Hawai‘i Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 708-830.5(1)(a) and -830(2); 
one count of Theft in the Second Degree, in violation of HRS §§ 
1 The Honorable Rom A. Trader presided. 
5  
 
  
   *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
708-831(1)(b) and -830(2); three counts of Money Laundering, in 
violation of HRS § 708A-3(1)(a)(ii)(A); two counts of Use of a 
Computer in the Commission of a Separate Crime, in violation of 
HRS § 708-893(1)(a) (Counts 8 and 9); and four counts of Forgery 
in the Second Degree, in violation of HRS § 708-852. 
With respect to counts 8 and 9 of the indictment, the 
two use of a computer charges attendant to the thefts in the 
first degree charges in counts 2 and 3, HRS § 708-893(1)(a) provided in relevant part, “(1) A person commits the offense of 
use of a computer in the commission of a separate crime if the 
person: (a) Intentionally uses a computer to obtain control 
over the property of the victim to commit theft in the first or 
second degree.” Subsection (2) of HRS § 708-893 then provided 
and still provides that the “[u]se of a computer in the 
commission of a separate crime is an offense one class or 
grade . . . greater than the offense facilitated. 
Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, a conviction under this section shall not merge with a conviction for the 
separate crime.” 
6    Before trial, Oki filed a motion to dismiss the use of 
a computer in the commission of a separate theft charges, counts 
8 and 9; he then filed an amended motion. He argued that the 
use of a computer charges were defective because they 
(1) involved penalties amounting to cruel “and/or” unusual  
 
    
 
   
 
    
 
  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
punishment;  (2) violated his rights to due process and equal 
protection; (3) were not rationally related to a legitimate 
public purpose; (4) were overbroad as a matter of law; and 
(5) did not apply to this case pursuant to rules of statutory 
construction.  2
As support for his cruel and unusual punishment 
argument, Oki cited House Bill 2561 of 2016, which at that time, 
had been approved by the legislature but had not yet become law. Oki noted that the bill, which later became Act 231 of 2016, 
would completely repeal the subsection of HRS § 708-893 upon 
which Oki’s use of a computer charges were based, which was HRS 
§ 708-893(1)(a). Act 231 became law on July 11, 2016, with an 
effective date of July 1, 2016, after Oki was charged but before 
he was tried and sentenced. 
2016 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 231, § 72 
at 776. 
The circuit court denied Oki’s motion to dismiss. 
With respect to Act 231, the circuit court relied on the act’s 
savings clause, which provides in part, “SECTION 70. This Act 
does not affect rights and duties that matured, penalties that 
2 The Hawaiʻi Constitution’s language differs from that of the 
United States Constitution. The Eighth Amendment of the latter bans “cruel 
and unusual punishment,” but our 
article I, s ection 12 prohibits the 
infliction of “cruel or unusual punishment.”

were incurred, and proceedings that were begun before its 
effective date.”3 2016 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 231, § 70 at 775. 
On November 30, 2016, the circuit court entered its 
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying 
Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss Counts 8 and 9 of the Indictment 
(FOFs/COLs/Order denying motion to dismiss). The circuit court 
concluded Act 231 did not affect Oki’s case because Oki’s 
“proceedings,” which it interpreted as his prosecution, began before Act 231 was enacted. 
Following a bench trial, Oki was convicted of all 
charges except that one count of first-degree theft in violation 
of HRS §§ 708-830.5(1)(a) and -830(2) was reduced to the lesser-
included charge of second-degree theft in violation of HRS 
§ 708-831(1)(b) (Supp. 2012) and -830(2) (Supp. 2005). 
The circuit court then sentenced Oki to concurrent 
sentences of ten years each for counts 1 through 3, five years 
for count 4, ten years each for counts 5 through 7, twenty years each for counts 8 and 9, and five years each for counts 10 
through 13, with credit for time served. The circuit court 
entered an initial judgment of conviction and sentence on 
October 17, 2017; after determining restitution, it entered an 
amended judgment of conviction and sentence on May 24, 2018. 
3  The savings clause goes on to exempt three sections of the act 
involving dru
g-related offenses (specifically, methamphetamine).  2016 Haw.

 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 As to the time and manner of payment, the circuit 
court stated: The State filed a motion for restitution asserting the 
former partners were direct victims to whom Oki owed restitution 
under HRS § 706-646. Oki opposed the motion and requested no 
restitution or, in the alternative, that restitution be ordered 
to be paid to Spire. 
Spire also submitted letters to the 
circuit court requesting restitution as the victim of Oki’s theft crimes. 
The circuit court granted the State’s motion for restitution and ordered Oki to pay $440,178.54 in restitution. 
Restitution is to be paid as provided by law while 
Mr. Oki is incarcerated and thereafter at a rate –  at the 
bare minimum it would need to be $30 a month. I certainly
full well recognize based upon Mr. Oki’s income earning 
ability, as reflected in this case but also in the   
presentence report, and while I certainly appreciate that it has been adversely impacted by his conviction in this 
case, at this point I don’t have, I believe, sufficient information to know what would be reasonable beyond that 
$30 a month.   
But if either side wishes to revisit that, and most 
likely it would be the State, to seek an increase in the 
amount ordered –  but that would depend upon Mr. Oki’s 
ability to earn, his income earning capacity 
–  then the 
Court’s more than willing to consider that at a future 
date.  
9  The circuit court also entered a free-standing 
restitution order ordering Oki to pay $440,158.54 in restitution 
to PKF, “including but not limited to Lawrence Chew, Deneen 
Nakashima, Dwayne Takeno[, and] Trisha Nomura in their capacities as [former] partners of PKF.” Restitution was to be  
 
  
 
 
 
     
 
 
  
 
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
paid as provided by HRS § 353-22.6 (Supp. 2016)4 during Oki’s 
incarceration and “thereafter at a rate of at least $30.00 per 
month.” 
C. Oki I 
During the first appeal, Oki asserted: 
(1) the circuit court erred in denying Oki’s Motion to 
Suppress Evidence from Warrantless Search; (2) the circuit 
court erred in denying Oki’s Motion to Suppress Evidence 
from Unlawful Warrant; (3) the circuit court erred in denying Oki’s [Motion to Dismiss] Counts 8 & 9; (4) there 
was insufficient evidence that Oki intended to permanently 
deprive the partnership of any property; and (5) the 
circuit court erred in granting the State’s Motion for 
Restitution. 
Oki I, 2020 WL 3027401, at *10. The State cross-appealed and 
contended “the circuit court erred in refusing to order Oki to 
pay restitution directly to Chew, Nakashima, Takeno, and Nomura, 
in their capacities as the sole partners of PKF at the time of 
Oki’s offenses.” Id.
 In its memorandum opinion, the ICA affirmed, except as 
to restitution. Oki I, 2020 WL 3027401, at *25. The ICA remanded to the circuit court to order restitution “directly to 
4 HRS § 353-22.6 provided, 
The director of public safety shall enforce victim 
restitution orders against all moneys earned by the inmate 
or deposited or credited to the inmate’ s individual account 
while incarcerated. Notwithstanding any law or order to 
the contrary, the amount deducted shall be twenty- five per 
cent of the total of all moneys earned, new deposits, and credits to the inmate’ s individual account. The moneys 
intended for victim restitution shall be deducted monthly 
and paid to the victim once the amount reaches $25, or 
annually, whichever is sooner. This section shall not 
apply to moneys earned on work furlough pursuant to section 
353–17. 
10  
 
  
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Spire” rather than to PKF, including but not limited to the 
former partners in their capacity as partners. Id.
 The ICA’s memorandum opinion also included a footnote 
addressing Act 231: 
Oki also contends that the legislature’s decision to 
remove theft from the purview of HRS § 708- 893 in 2016 
supports his argument that the statute imposed cruel and 
unusual punishment. See  2016 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 231, § 42 
at 758-59.  Oki specifically points to House Bill 2561, 
which led to the removal of theft in the first or second 
degree as underlying offenses that would subject a person 
to the separate offense of Use of a Computer and enhanced penalties. See  H.B. 2561, 28th Leg., Reg. Sess. (2016). 
House Bill 2561 recommended amending HRS § 708- 893 by 
“[r]epealing a provision that subjects a person to a 
separate charge and enhanced penalty for using a computer 
to commit an underlying theft crime because it seems unduly 
harsh, given the prevalence of ‘smart phones’ and other 
computing devices.” Id.  (emphasis added). Oki argues that 
the legislature’s description of the provision as “unduly harsh” lends support to his argument that the statute 
unconstitutionally imposes cruel and unusual punishment.  
We do not agree that the legislature’s 
characterization of the provision as “unduly harsh” 
indicates an acknowledgment that the statute violated the 
protection against cruel and unusual punishment. 
The Act 
contained a savings clause, providing that the repeal of 
the provision held only proactive effect and did not have 
any retroactive effect: “This Act does not affect rights 
and duties that matured, penalties that were incurred, and 
proceedings that were begun before its effective date[.]” 2016 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 231, § 70 at 775. If the 
legislature intended to, it could have made the law have 
retroactive effect, but it did not.  
Oki I, 2020 WL 3027401, at *18 n.22. 
11   Oki applied for certiorari review, raising four 
questions. Relevant here, the third was whether the ICA erred 
in affirming the denial of the motion to dismiss the computer 
crimes charges that had been repealed as “unduly harsh” and 
constituting cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the 
federal and state constitutions. This court denied certiorari

over Justice Wilson’s dissent. State v. Oki, No. SCWC-18-
0000501, 2020 WL 6115119 (Haw. Oct. 16, 2020) (order rejecting 
app. for cert.). D. Remand

On remand, Oki filed a motion for restitution hearing 
and study, which the State opposed. The circuit court denied the motion. At the hearing on the motion, the circuit court 
indicated it was constrained to closely follow the ICA’s 
directive on remand: 
The court notes that the discussion that was . . . 
reflected in the ICA’s opinion did indicate that there was 
no challenge to the total amount of restitution, but the 
challenge was to the manner in which restitution should be 
collected or distributed. 
Also it noted that all parties agreed that PKF now 
exists . . . as Spire . . . . 
 It concluded therefore after determining that the 
partners[,]  although identified as victims[,] that that 
only exists because of their relationship with PKF, but 
that the actual victim and the sole victim was PKF, and 
therefore they determined that although there might be some 
civil proceeding, that this court should change it or 
–  it 
would come back to this court for the purpose of ordering 
restitution directly to Spire, the entity formerly known as 
PKF.  
 I understand the argument that the defendants are 
making saying that well now everything is changed. 
However, I believe that [the State] is correct, there is a very specific order by the ICA that says, and that’s why I 
started with this quote, this matter is remanded to the 
circuit court to order restitution directly to Spire, the 
entity formerly known as PKF. It doesn’t tell me that I 
need to make other hearings to determine if restitution should be different based on the finding that the four 
partners were not the direct victim. 
The court is 
constrained to do any differently.    
5 The Honorable Catherine H. Remigio presided on remand. 
12  
 
   *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
It entered a second amended judgment, filed February 
10, 2021 (judgment) and an amended restitution order, filed 
February 11, 2021 (restitution order). The circuit court 
ordered Oki to pay restitution directly to Spire, in the same 
amount and time and manner as in the initial restitution order. 
The circuit court entered its Order Denying Defendant’s Motion 
for Restitution Hearing and Study on March 22, 2021. 
In March 2021, Oki filed a motion to correct illegal 
sentence. Oki asserted the circuit court had the power to 
correct Oki’s illegal sentence in counts 8 and 9 pursuant to 
Hawaiʻi Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 35(a) (eff. 2003), 
which provides in part that “[t]he court may correct an illegal 
sentence at any time and may correct a sentence imposed in an 
illegal manner” upon a motion filed within 90 days of the 
sentence’s imposition. 
Oki asserted his sentence for counts 8 and 9 was 
illegal because the offense of the use of a computer in the commission of a separate theft, HRS § 708-893(1)(a), was 
repealed before his trial and sentencing. The State opposed 
Oki’s motion to correct illegal sentence. 
The circuit court held a hearing on the motion to 
correct illegal sentence on April 27, 2021, and took the matter 
under advisement. On March 8, 2022, the circuit court entered 
13  
 
  
 
 
   
 
  
 
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order denying 
defendant’s motion to correct illegal sentence. 
The circuit court indicated it had already ruled Act 
231 did not bar Oki’s prosecution, conviction, and sentence for 
counts 8 and 9 in the FOFs/COLs/Order denying motion to dismiss, 
and the ICA had also already acknowledged Act 231 did not have 
retroactive effect and affirmed the circuit court in that 
respect. Citing Wong v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 66 Haw. 389, 665 P.2d 157 (1983), the circuit court concluded those rulings 
were the “law of the case” and that it could find no “cogent 
reason” to vacate the convictions that were upheld on appeal. 
The circuit court further concluded Oki’s illegal 
sentence argument was barred by the doctrine of collateral 
estoppel and res judicata.
6 The circuit court also stated that 
because Oki had already conceded Act 231 could not serve as a basis for dismissal of counts 8 and 9, he was now barred from 
arguing the opposite. 
The circuit court concluded Oki had waived any 
argument based on State v. Avilla, 69 Haw. 509, 750 P.2d 78 (1988), but also found it to be without merit. The circuit 
6 This conclusion is wrong, as res judicata and collateral estoppel 
principles only apply after “final judgment” has entered and under Hawaiʻi 
law, there is no final judgment until all appeals have been exhausted. See 
Saplan v. U.S. Bank Nat’l Ass’n
, No. SCWC- 17-0000847, at *20- 21 n.8 (Haw. May 
20, 2024) (citing E. Sav. Bank, FSB v. Esteban
, 129 Hawai‘i 154, 160, 296 P.3d 
1062, 1068 (2013)) .  
14  
 
    
   
 
   *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
court determined the legislature did not intend to give 
retroactive effect to the statutory amendment deleting use of a 
computer because it only provided exceptions to the savings 
clause for the drug-related offenses. It agreed with the State 
that because Act 231 was “comprehensive legislation,” Oki’s case 
was more similar to Reis than Avilla. 
E. Appellate Proceedings 
The ICA affirmed the circuit court’s judgment and 
restitution order and affirmed in part the order denying Oki’s motion to correct illegal sentence. 
The ICA held the circuit court did not err in ordering 
restitution to Spire without another restitution hearing and a 
restitution study. The ICA pointed out the Oki I memorandum 
opinion expressly noted that neither party had challenged the 
total amount of restitution, but merely the manner in which the 
restitution should be distributed; the ICA had directed the 
circuit court on remand “to order restitution directly to Spire” but affirmed the judgment “in all other respects.” The ICA 
concluded that on remand, the circuit court closely adhered to 
“the true intent and meaning” of its Oki I mandate. (Quoting In
re HELCO, 149 Hawai
ʻi at 241, 487 P.3d at 710.) 
As to the time and manner of restitution payment, the 
ICA held Oki had waived the issue because he did not raise it in 
15  
 
    
   *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
his first appeal nor cite to where in the record he raised it on 
remand. 
As to the merits of the illegal sentence issue, the 
ICA majority indicated it turned on the meaning of the term 
“proceedings” in the Act 231 savings clause. The majority 
opined that Reis is “directly on point.” The majority referred 
to the principle that it must presume the legislature knew the 
law, including Reis’s interpretation of “proceedings,” when enacting Act 231. It agreed with the State that construing 
“proceedings” to mean trial and sentencing would render 
superfluous the provisions of the Act 231 savings clause that 
provide exceptions for certain drug-related offenses. 
The majority also deemed Oki’s illegal sentence 
argument unavailing because Reis interpreted an identical 
savings clause to mean that a defendant incurs liability for a 
criminal penalty at the time they commit the offense. (Citing 
Reis
, 115 Hawaiʻi at 93, 165 P.3d at 994.) The majority 
concluded that, despite the legislature’s remedial purpose in 
repealing HRS § 708-893(1)(a), it must apply the plain meaning 
of “proceedings.” The majority also rejected Oki’s reliance on 
In re Estrada
, 408 P.2d 948 (Cal. 1965) and State v. Tapp, 490 
P.2d 334 (Utah 1971) and concluded the circuit court did not err in denying Oki’s motion to correct illegal sentence. 
16  
 
    
 
   
 
  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Judge Wadsworth dissented as to the illegal sentence 
issue. He disagreed with the majority’s conclusion that Reis is 
directly on point and Avilla is distinguishable. Judge 
Wadsworth emphasized that Reis only held that “‘proceedings,’ 
absent ambiguity arising from [the] subject matter peculiar to 
the legislation, means criminal prosecutions.” 115 Hawai‘ i at 
97-98, 165 P.3d at 998-99. 
Judge Wadsworth opined that the repealing legislation 
shared relevant similarities with that in Avilla, not Reis. 
First, although Act 231 is broad, section 42 pertains solely to 
the repeal of HRS § 708-893(1)(a). Second, the express 
legislative purpose was to eliminate an “unduly harsh” separate charge and enhanced penalty for use of a computer. That 
purpose, according to Judge Wadsworth, injected ambiguity into 
the term “proceedings” as used in the savings clause “and 
applied to section 42.” Thus, “[i]n this unique context, 
‘proceedings’ can mean trial and sentencing proceedings begun 
after the Act’s effective date for pre-effective date 
violations.” F. Certiorari Proceedings 
Oki argues that the ICA erred by (1) holding Reis, 
rather than Avilla, controls and affirming his conviction as to 
the use of a computer charges; (2) concluding Oki “‘waived’ his 
claim that the circuit court failed to consider his ability to

pay when ruling on how and when restitution would be paid;” and 
(3) holding “the circuit court could not revisit the amount of 
restitution on remand.” 
III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Motion to Correct Illegal Sentence 
  “A circuit court’s denial based on a conclusion of law, 
of a defendant’s HRPP Rule 35 motion to correct illegal sentence 
is reviewed de novo, under the right/wrong standard of review.”  
State v. Canosa, 152 Hawai‘ i  145,  155, 523 P.3d 1059, 1069 (2023) 
(citing State v. Kido, 109 Hawai ‘i 458, 461, 128 P.3d 340, 343  
(2006)). 
B. Statutory Interpretation 
 “The interpretation of a statute is a question of 
law. Review is de  novo, and the standard of review is 
right/wrong.”   Kimura v. Kamalo, 106 Hawai‘i  501, 507, 107 
P.3d 430, 436 (2005)  (citation omitted). Our statutory 
interpretation is guided by the following principles:  
First, the fundamental starting point for statutory 
interpretation is the language of the statute itself. 
Second, where the statutory language is plain and 
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain and obvious meaning. 
Third, implicit in the 
task of statutory construction is our foremost obligation to ascertain and give effect to the 
intention of the legislature, which is to be obtained 
primarily from the language contained in the statute itself. Fourth, when there is doubt, doubleness of 
meaning, or indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an 
expression used in a statute, an ambiguity exists. 
And fifth, in construing an ambiguous statute, the 
meaning of the ambiguous words may be sought by examining the context, with which the ambiguous 
words, phrases, and sentences may be compared, in 
order to ascertain their true meaning.

State v. Borge, 152 Hawai‘ i 458, 464, 526 P.3d 435, 441 (2023).   
C. Sentencing 
“The authority of a trial court to select and 
determine the severity of a penalty is normally undisturbed on 
review in the absence of an apparent abuse of discretion or 
unless applicable statutory or constitutional commands have not 
been observed.” Reis, 115 Hawai‘ i at 83, 165 P.3d at 984 
(quoting State v. Aplaca, 96 Hawai‘ i 17, 22, 25 P.3d 792, 797 
(2001)). 
IV. DISCUSSION 
A. Illegal Sentence 
On appeal, Oki challenges his convictions for use of a 
computer to facilitate first-degree theft as illegal because 
after he was charged with the offenses, but before his trial and 
sentencing, the statutory subsection under which he was convicted was repealed. We conclude that Reis controls and 
therefore affirm Oki’s convictions on counts 8 and 9. 
Act 231, which repealed the use of a computer offense 
of which Oki was convicted in counts 8 and 9, arose from an 
omnibus bill and amended multiple statutes in the Hawai‘i Penal 
Code. 2016 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 231, § 70 at 733-76. Section 42 
of Act 231 repealed HRS § 708-893(1)(a), the use of a computer

  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
in the commission of theft offense. 2016 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 
231, § 42 at 758. 
The act included a savings clause, section 70, which 
states: 
This Act does not affect rights and duties that 
matured, penalties that were incurred, and proceedings that 
were begun before its effective date; provided that sections 54, 55, and 56[
7] shall apply to offenses committed 
before the effective date of this Act: 
(1) But not yet charged as of its effective date; 
(2) Originally charged as a violation of section 
712-1240.7 or 712- 1240.8, Hawaiʻ i Revised 
Statutes, where the defendant: 
(a) Has not yet been placed in jeopardy or 
convicted on a plea or verdict; and 
(b) Waives any claim of denial of speedy trial rights for the period elapsing between the 
date of filing of the original charge and 
the date of filing of the new charge under 
this Act; 
(3) Originally charged as a violation of section 
712-1240.7 or 712- 1240.8, Hawaiʻ i Revised 
Statutes, for which the defendant has been 
convicted on a plea or verdict, but not yet 
sentenced, in which case the defendant shall be 
sentenced pursuant to this Act; and 
(4) Originally charged as a violation of section 
712-1240.7 or 712- 1240.8, Hawaiʻ i Revised 
Statutes, for which the defendant has been 
convicted on a plea or verdict and sentenced 
but for which no final judgment on appeal has 
been entered, in which case the appellate court 
shall either: 
(a) Remand the case for sentencing pursuant to 
this Act if the judgment is affirmed on 
appeal or if the sentence is vacated; or 
(b) Remand the case for further proceedings 
pursuant to this Act if the judgment is 
7 Those sections gave trial courts greater discretion in sentencing 
methamphetamine offenses. See 2016 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 231, §§ 54-56 at 764-
65; State v. Bovee
, 139 Hawai‘i 530, 543, 394 P.3d 760, 773 (2017). 
20  
 
   
  
  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
reversed and remanded for further  
proceedings.  
2016 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 231, § 70 at 775-76.  
  This court has previously interpreted the “penalties 
that were incurred” and “proceedings that were begun” savings 
clause language in two cases: Avilla and Reis. 
In 
Avilla, this court considered a savings clause 
substantially similar to the one at issue here. 1987 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 139, § 10 at 316 (“This Act does not affect rights and 
duties that matured, penalties that were incurred, and 
proceedings that were begun, before its effective date.”). 
Avilla argued that Act 139’s ameliorative bail provisions should 
apply to his case. Id. § 8 at 314-15. Act 139 provided 
defendants convicted of a felony the opportunity to seek bail pending appeal in limited circumstances. Avilla was indicted before Act 139’s effective date, but his appellate proceedings 
began after the effective date. Avilla, 69 Haw. at 511-12, 750 
P.2d at 79-80. He was convicted of two felonies and then filed a motion to continue bail pending appeal. Id. at 511, 750 P.2d 
at 79. The circuit court denied his motion, finding that “proceedings” applied to the beginning of the prosecution, and 
therefore he was not eligible for the Act’s ameliorative 
provisions. Id.
On appeal, this court rejected the circuit court’s 
interpretation and held that “proceedings” in the context of Act 
21  
 
  
 
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
139 applied to bail proceedings, rather than the beginning of a 
prosecution. Id. at 512, 750 P.2d at 80. We held the term 
“proceedings” was ambiguous because it could mean prosecutions, “but within the context of the statutes regulating the release 
of defendants on bail, it also [could] mean bail proceedings.” 
Id. 
In Reis, a defendant pled guilty to all charged counts 
of drug use, drug promotion, and prostitution. Prior to her sentencing, the legislature passed Act 44, which provided that 
“a person convicted for the first time for any 
offense . . . involving [drug] possession . . . . is eligible to 
be sentenced to probation.” 2004 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 44, § 11 
at 214. Act 44 contained a specific savings clause which read 
“[t]his Act does not affect rights and duties that matured, 
penalties that were incurred, and proceedings that were begun, 
before its effective date.” Id. § 29 at 227. Reis argued that 
because her sentencing proceedings had not begun until after Act 
44’s passage, she should be entitled to the act’s ameliorative 
sentencing provisions. 
This court rejected her argument, concluding that 
“‘proceedings,’ absent ambiguity arising from subject matter 
peculiar to the legislation, means criminal prosecutions of 
which sentencing hearings are an inseparable component” and 
therefore, Reis was subject to the sentencing provisions in 
22  
 
   
 
    
     
 
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
place at the time the criminal prosecution against her began. 
Reis, 115 Hawai ʻi at 97–98, 165 P.3d at 998–99. We held that 
“proceedings” in the context of Act 44 “unambiguously means the 
initiation of a criminal prosecution against a defendant through a charging instrument and subsumes within its scope hearings and 
other procedural events that arise as a direct result of the 
initial charging instrument.” 
Id. at 98, 165 P.3d at 999. In 
doing so, we noted the initiation of criminal proceedings through a formal felony prosecution, preliminary hearing, 
indictment, information, or arraignment “is the starting point 
of our whole system of adversary criminal justice.” Id.
(quoting State v. Luton, 83 Hawai‘ i 443, 449, 927 P.2d 844, 850 
(1996)). 
We then distinguished Avilla: 
Avilla, therefore, does not stand, as Reis contends, for 
the proposition that this court construes the language of 
the standard savings clause “in a manner that best 
effectuates the underlying legislative intent and purpose 
of that particular statute.” We resort to legislative 
history only when there is an ambiguity in the plain 
language of the statute. [ State v. ]Valdivia
, 95 Hawai‘i 
[465,] 472, 24 P.3d [661,] 668 [(2001)]. Rather, Avilla 
stands for the unremarkable proposition that, if a 
statutory amendment on a single subject addresses proceedings other than criminal prosecutions
—and the 
numerous hearings subsumed within criminal prosecutions, including hearings on evidentiary matters, motions for 
reconsideration, and sentencing— so as to give rise to an 
ambiguity, the defendant may benefit from the amendment if 
doing so would comport with the intent of the legislature 
as reflected in the amendment's underlying legislative 
history. 
Id. at 90, 165 P.3d at 991. 
23  
 
   In Reis, we also interpreted the meaning of the 
savings clause “penalties that were incurred” language. Id. at 
91-93, 165 P.3d at 992-94. We held that a defendant “incurs” a 
penalty at the time of the commission of the offense. Id.
 
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Here, Oki asks for relief from his sentence for the 
use of a computer in the commission of a separate crime under 
HRS § 708-893(1)(a) (2014) when that sentence was imposed after 
Act 231 became law. Section 70 of Act 231 reads the same as the savings clauses in 
Reis, but notably, also provides exceptions 
for certain drug-related offenses. Because there is no ambiguity to the term “proceedings,” and because Oki’s crime was 
not excluded from section 70’s savings language, Reis must 
control. 
In both Reis and here, “proceedings” is not ambiguous 
because the relevant acts address criminal proceedings 
generally, rather than only one stage of the criminal 
proceedings, as in Avilla. In Reis, this court held that “proceedings” applied to the initiation of a criminal 
prosecution because there, Act 44 “[was] comprehensive 
legislation enacted to address the epidemic of crystal 
methamphetamine use in the state” that introduced new charges 
and adjusted sentencing provisions, amongst other changes. 115 
Hawai
ʻi at 89, 165 P.3d at 990. Here, Act 231, which repealed 
the use of a computer offense of which Oki was convicted in 
24  
 
  
   *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
counts 8 and 9, arose from an omnibus bill and amended multiple 
statutes in the Hawai ʻi Penal Code. 
We explained in Reis that Avilla was distinguishable 
because Avilla focused on “a statutory amendment on a single 
subject address[ing] proceedings other than criminal 
prosecutions” generally. Id. at 90, 165 P.3d at 991. But here, 
Act 231 was the product of an omnibus review of the penal code that resulted in a variety of changes that applied to various 
stages of criminal proceedings – from the repeal of the 
computer-crime charges, to changes in sentencing for meth-
related crimes, amongst many others. The act in Avilla solely addressed bail proceedings, thereby infusing the word 
“proceedings” with ambiguity because it might refer to the 
beginning of a prosecution or the beginning of appellate bail 
proceedings. See Avilla, 69 Haw. at 512–13, 750 P.2d at 80. 
Conversely, here, Act 231 does not focus on one stage in the criminal prosecution, and thus “proceedings” is not ambiguous. 
There being no ambiguity, we defer to the “standard 
interpretation of ‘proceedings’ as the initiation of a criminal 
prosecution.” Reis
, 115 Hawaiʻi at 90, 165 P.3d at 991. 
In other words, it was clear in 
Reis that the 
“proceedings” language of the relevant bill referred to the 
beginning of the prosecution, while in Avilla, it was ambiguous as to whether “proceedings” referred to the initial charges or 
25  
 
  
  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
to appellate proceedings. But here, like in Reis, there is no 
ambiguity because Act 231 encompasses changes to criminal 
proceedings generally, rather than applying to only one stage of 
those proceedings. 
This conclusion is also supported by the plain 
language of Act 231’s savings clause, section 70. “[T]his court 
must presume that the legislature meant what it said and is 
further barred from rejecting otherwise unambiguous statutory 
language.” State v. Demello, 136 Hawai‘ i 193, 195, 361 P.3d 420, 
422 (2015) (quoting Morgan v. Plan. Dep't, Cnty. of Kaua‘ i, 104 
Hawai‘i 173, 185, 86 P.3d 982, 994 (2004)). “[T]he legislature 
is presumed to know the law when enacting statutes,” including 
this court’s decisions. Agustin v. Dan Ostrow Const. Co., 64 
Haw. 80, 83, 636 P.2d 1348, 1351 (1981) (“[W]e must presume that the legislature knew of the definition we assigned to the word 
‘accrued’” in another case). 
Here, we presume the legislature was aware of our 
holding in Reis, where we clearly defined “proceedings,” as discussed above. This court stated in Reis that “[t]he 
inclusion of a specific savings clause within the body of the 
amending statute demonstrates a clear legislative intent that 
the contents of the act do not apply retroactively.” Reis
, 115 
Hawai‘i at 90, 165 P.3d at 991; 
see also id. at 90 n.19, 165 P.3d 
at 991 n.19. 
26  
 
   The legislature clearly intended for Act 231 to apply 
retroactively to certain specific provisions, which did not 
include section 42. 
Specifically, it outlined that “sections 
54, 55, and 56 [of Act 231] shall apply to offenses committed before the effective date of this Act.” 2016 Haw. Sess. Laws 
Act 231, § 70 at 775. It then specified which law, either the 
previous statute or Act 231, should apply to which defendants. 
The legislature thus knew how to apply Act 231 retroactively to certain defendants at different stages of criminal proceedings. 
But it deliberately chose not to address defendants affected by 
section 42. This targeted approach to creating exceptions in 
the otherwise broad sweep of the savings clause is indicative of 
the legislature’s intent. See State v. Choy Foo, 142 
Hawai‘i 65, 
74, 414 P.3d 117, 126 (2018) (“[T]he canon of construction 
expressio unius est exclusio alterius holds that to express or 
include one thing implies the exclusion of the other, or of the 
alternative.”) (italics and quotation omitted); Goran Pleho, LLC 
v. Lacy, 144 Hawai‘ i 224, 251, 439 P.3d 176, 203 (2019) (“This 
court may not take it upon itself to add an additional exception 
that the legislature has declined to adopt.”). 
  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Oki argues that the legislature repealed the use of a 
computer charge offenses “to prevent unduly harsh separate charges” and therefore upholding his convictions would undermine the legislature’s intent. Similarly, the dissent states, “[i]t 
27  
 
   
  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
is difficult to understand why we would say the legislature did 
not intend to give a defendant the benefit of the more humane 
sentence.” But the legislature knew how to give Oki that 
benefit, and it specifically chose not to do so. See State v.
Cotton, 55 Haw. 148, 151, 516 P.2d 715, 718 (1973) (“[E]nactment of laws is the prerogative of the legislature and it is not for 
the judiciary to secondguess the legislature or substitute its 
judgment for that of the legislature.”); see also Shibuya v.Architects Hawaii Ltd., 65 Haw. 26, 41, 647 P.2d 276, 286 
(1982) (“[A] court should not substitute its view of wise or 
fair legislative policy for that of the duly elected 
representatives of the people.”) (quotation omitted). 
The dissent attempts to distinguish Reis on the basis 
that “it addressed a statute that reduced penalties, not one 
that repealed a crime.” (Emphases omitted.) But the dissent 
does not explain why that distinction should matter. To the 
contrary, our reasoning in Reis still applies: “an unambiguous term can[not] be rendered ambiguous merely because the statutory 
provision urged as applicable by the defendant is ameliorative.” 
115 Hawai‘ i at 88, 165 P.3d at 989.   
Moreover, Reis’s policy rationale applies with equal 
force here. See State v. Stocker
, 90 Hawai‘i 85, 95, 976 P.2d 
399, 409 (1999) (“[A] court should not overrule its earlier 
decisions unless the most cogent reasons and inescapable logic 
28  
 
   
   
 
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
require it.”) We explained in Reis that our interpretation of 
“proceedings” and “incurred” accorded with a consistent 
application of the terms across a variety of statutes, and 
preserved the constitutionality of the statute as a whole: 
To interpret “proceedings” to mean any discrete hearing 
pertaining to sentencing, motions for reconsideration, or 
appellate review would, in practice, mean that the savings clause would not operate to exclude a defendant's case 
unless all stages of a prosecution and all appeals were 
entirely concluded prior to the effective date of an 
amendment. Such a construction would vitiate the very 
reason for enacting a savings clause, to wit, (1) to delineate clearly which defendants fall under the new 
statute, in order to avoid producing inconsistent and 
unjust outcomes among defendants arising from the vagaries 
of the scheduling process, and (2) to avoid rendering 
portions of an act— Act 44 in the present matter -
potentially unconstitutional as ex post facto measures. To 
construe penalties as having been “incurred” only at the moment of the imposition of sentence would similarly 
generate risks of inconsistency and constitutional 
infirmity. 
Reis, 115 Hawai‘ i at 93, 165 P.3d at 994. 
29  
 The dissent contends that the rule of lenity applies 
because “proceedings” is ambiguous. Respectfully, the Reis
majority considered similar arguments at length and rejected the 
position the dissent advances again today. Reis’s analysis 
remains valid, and has informed the subsequent actions of the 
legislature, including the legislature that adopted Act 231. It should not be set aside, even in a limited instance, without 
compelling justification, which does not exist here. See State
v. Garcia, 96 
Hawai‘i 200, 206, 29 P.3d 919, 925 (2001) (noting 
that a court should “not depart from the doctrine of stare 
decisis without some compelling justification,” and further  
 
   
 
 
  
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
observing that “considerations of stare decisis have special 
force in the area of statutory interpretation.”) (citations, 
brackets, and emphasis omitted). 
Reis therefore controls in this case. While the 
outcome is harsh for Oki, following the settled precedent of 
this court ensures stability and reliability in our legal 
system. Id. (“Adherence to the principle of stare decisis has 
added force when the legislature, in the public sphere, and 
citizens, in the private realm, have acted in reliance on a 
previous decision, for in this instance overruling the decision 
would dislodge settled rights and expectations or require an 
extensive legislative response.”) (brackets and quotation 
omitted). 
B. Waiver Versus Forfeiture and Plain Error Review of the 
Time and Manner of Restitution Payment 
Second, we turn to Oki’s request that this court 
clarify the difference between waiver and forfeiture. 
Regarding 
Oki’s contention that the circuit court erroneously failed to 
consider his financial ability to make restitution for the 
purpose of establishing the time and manner of payment as 
required by HRS § 706-646(3), the ICA concluded, “Oki failed to raise this issue in his first appeal, and he does not state 
where in the record he raised it on remand; the issue is 
therefore waived.” (Citing 
Hawai‘i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
30  
 
   *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4); State v. Moses, 102 Hawai‘ i 449, 456, 77 
P.3d 940, 947 (2003); State v. Hoglund, 71 Haw. 147, 150, 785 
P.2d 1311, 1313.) 
Although the terms waiver and forfeiture are often 
used interchangeably, they are distinct concepts. See generally
Noah J. Gordon & Kristina E. Music Biro, Nat’l Legal Rsch. Grp., 
28 Am. Jur. 2d Estoppel and Waiver § 184 (2024). Forfeiture is 
a “failure to make a timely assertion of a right,” whereas 
waiver is “the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a 
known right.” Id. (footnote omitted); see also, e.g., United
States v. Pembrook, 79 F.4th 720, 724 n.1 (6th Cir. 2023). This court has not addressed the distinction between waiver and forfeiture, although several cases have acknowledged it. See
State v. Timoteo, 87 Hawai‘ i 108, 119, 952 P.2d 865, 876 (1997) 
(Ramil, J., dissenting) (“Strictly speaking, ‘waiver’ is the 
intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right. 
However, waiver is different from forfeiture. 
‘Forfeiture’ 
should be defined as the automatic and unintentional loss of a right, such as that resulting from the failure to make the 
timely assertion of a right.” (quotations, citations, and 
brackets omitted)); State v. Lui
, No. SCWC-11-0000081, 2013 WL 
693008, at *6 n.1 (order denying certiorari) (Pollack, J., dissenting) (“‘Forfeiture’ is distinct from the concept of 
‘waiver[.]’”); State v. Nichols, 111 Hawai‘ i 436, 443, 142 P.3d 
31  
 
   
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
300, 307 (App. 2005), vacated on other grounds, 111 Hawai‘ i 327, 
141 P.3d 974 (2006) (“Waiver is different from forfeiture. 
Whereas forfeiture is the failure to make the timely assertion of a right, waiver is the ‘intentional relinquishment or 
abandonment of a known right.’ . . . Mere forfeiture, as opposed 
to waiver, does not extinguish an ‘error’ under Rule 
52(b).”) (quoting Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464 (1938)). 
Hawai‘i
 court rul
es, as well as some of our opinions, 
appear to use the terms interchangeably. HRAP Rule 28(b)(7) 
(eff. 2022), for example, provides that “points not argued may 
be deemed waived.” But the plain language of HRPP Rule 52(b) 
permits the appellate court to notice plain error, even if a 
point is not argued. See
 HRPP Rule 52(b) (“Plain errors or 
defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although 
they were not brought to the attention of the court.”). 
Oki asserts the circuit court plainly erred in setting the time 
and manner of restitution because it failed to consider his 
financial ability to make restitution pursuant to HRS § 706-
646(3). HRS § 706-646(3) provided and provides in relevant 
part, 
In ordering restitution, the court shall not consider 
the defendant’s financial ability to make restitution in 
determining the amount of restitution to order. The court,
however, shall consider the defendant’s financial ability 
to make restitution for the purpose of establishing the 
time and manner of payment. The court shall specify the 
time and manner in which restitution is to be paid. While 
the defendant is in the custody of the department of 
32  
 
  
 
 
 
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
corrections and rehabilitation, restitution shall be 
collected pursuant to chapter 353 and any court- ordered 
payment schedule shall be suspended. 
(Emphasis added.) 
The circuit court did, however, consider Oki’s 
financial ability to make restitution. The circuit court 
explained it had considered Oki’s “income earning ability, as 
reflected in this case but also in the presentence report,” as 
well as the adverse impact of Oki’s conviction on such ability. The circuit court ordered Oki to pay restitution “as provided by 
law while Mr. Oki is incarcerated and thereafter at a rate – at 
the bare minimum it would need to be $30 a month.” The circuit 
court continued, “at this point I don’t have, I believe, 
sufficient information to know what would be reasonable beyond 
that $30 a month.” It left open the possibility of revisiting 
the time and manner of payment in the future, depending on Oki’s future ability to earn. 
Because the circuit court expressly considered Oki’s 
income earning ability, it complied with the requirements of HRS 
§ 706-646(3). The circuit court thus did not err in setting the 
time and manner of restitution payments. 
C. Revisiting the Restitution Amount on Remand 
Finally, Oki argues the ICA erred in holding that its 
“remand mandate from Oki’s first appeal precluded the circuit 
33  
 
  
 
   
 
  
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
court from conducting a new restitution study on remand or 
otherwise revisiting the amount of restitution.” 
Here, the ICA pointed out that its Oki I memorandum 
opinion expressly noted that neither party had challenged the 
total amount of restitution, but merely the manner in which the 
restitution should be distributed; the ICA had directed the 
circuit court on remand “to order restitution directly to Spire” 
but affirmed the judgment “in all other respects.” The ICA concluded that on remand, the circuit court closely adhered to 
“the true intent and meaning” of its Oki I mandate. (Quoting In
re HELCO, 149 Hawai‘ i at 241, 487 P.3d at 710.) 
Oki misapprehends the ICA’s holding. The ICA did not 
hold its remand mandate “precluded” the circuit court from 
revisiting restitution; rather, it held the circuit court “did 
not err in ordering restitution to Spire without another 
restitution hearing and a restitution study.” The ICA was 
correct. 
At a hearing on the State’s motion for restitution in 
Oki’s first appeal, the circuit court concluded that the amount of restitution should be the $440,178.54 in proven losses; it 
then discussed in depth to whom that restitution should be 
ordered (the former partners in their capacity as partners or 
the firm). During Oki’s first appeal, the ICA remanded with a 
directive to the circuit court “to order restitution directly to 
34  
 
    
 
  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Spire.” Oki, 2020 WL 6115119, at *25. The ICA’s memorandum 
opinion also had noted that “neither party expressly challenges 
the $440,158.54 total amount of restitution ordered by the 
circuit court. The parties instead dispute the manner in which 
the restitution should be collected/distributed.” Id. at *22. 
Then, on remand, the circuit court declined to order a new restitution hearing or study and entered a judgment and 
restitution order with restitution to be paid to Spire. HRS § 706-646(2) allows for restitution of a victim’s losses 
that are (1) reasonable; (2) verified; (3) suffered as a result 
of the defendant’s conduct; and (4) requested by the victim. 
Demello, 136 Hawai‘ i at 196, 361 P.3d at 423; see also Borge, 152 
Hawai‘i at 467, 526 P.3d at 444.   
“On remand, a trial court must closely adhere to the 
true intent and meaning of the appellate court’s mandate.” In
re HELCO
, 149 Hawai‘i at 241, 487 P.3d at 710 (citing 
State v. 
Lincoln, 72 Haw. 480, 485, 825 P.2d 64, 68 (1992)). 
Here, the circuit court closely adhered to the true 
intent and meaning of the ICA’s memorandum opinion when it 
entered an amended order changing the recipient of the 
restitution but nothing else. The circuit court had already 
held restitution hearings and taken evidence on Spire’s 
“reasonable and verified losses.” See HRS § 706-646(2). We 
therefore agree with the ICA that the circuit court did not err 
35  
 
   
  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
in denying Oki’s motion for restitution hearing and study when 
it entered the amended restitution order. 
III. CONCLUSION 
Based on the reasoning above, we affirm the ICA’s 
October 24, 2023 judgment on appeal.
