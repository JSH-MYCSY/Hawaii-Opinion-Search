AND CIRCUIT JUDGE CATALDO AND CIRCUIT JUDGE MALINAO,
ASSIGNED BY REASON OF VACANCIES 
 OPINION OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J.  
I. Introduction 
The State of Hawai‘i (“the State”) appeal s a pretrial 
suppression order of the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit    
    
 
   
   
 
  
 
 
    
  
   
  
 
    
 
                     
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(“circuit court”) . The circuit court1 suppressed text message 
evidence in the sexual assault prosecution of defendant Dylan 
River James (“James”) . During an interview of the complaining 
witness (“CW”), police detectives directed her to contact James to discuss the incident.  CW tried to call James while with the 
officers, but James did not pick up. CW later texted James, who 
responded; James apparently made admissions during the text 
conversation with CW. 
The circuit court granted James’s motion to suppress the 
text messages, reasoning (1) CW was acting as a government agent 
when she texted James; therefore (2)(a) James’s rights against 
self-incrimination under the federal and Hawaiʻi constitutions 
were violated because no Miranda warnings were given; and 
(b) James’s rights to counsel under the federal and Hawai ʻi 
constitutions were 
violated because he was not advised of his 
right to counsel. The circuit court also denied the State ’s 
motion for reconsideration. 
The State appeal  ed and the ICA affirmed.    State v. James
, 
No. CAAP-22-0000260, 2023 WL 3017974  (Haw. App. Apr. 20, 2023) 
(SDO). The ICA held that pursuant   to the bright-line rule of  
State v. Ketchum, 97 Hawai‘i 107,  34 P.3d 1006 (2001), Miranda  
warnings were required before James was “interrogated ”  because 
The Honorable Randal G.B. Valenciano presided.

probable cause existed at the time CW texted James. James, 2023 
WL 3017974, at *6 (citing State v. Hewitt , 153 Hawai‘ i 33, 36, 
526 P.3d 558, 561 (2023))
.  The ICA did not address the right to 
counsel issue. 2023 WL 3017974, at *1 n.4.  The ICA also held 
it lacked appellate jurisdiction over the circuit court’s denial 
of the State’s motion for reconsideration. 2023 WL 3017974, at 
*1 n.1. 
The circuit court and ICA erred. 
Under the Fifth Amendment 
to the United States Constitution and article I, section 10 of 
the Hawaiʻ i Constitution, Miranda warnings are only required for 
“custodial” interrogations. Although CW was acting as a 
government agent, James was not “in custody” when there was no 
stop or detention or other deprivation of his freedom of action 
by law enforcement. 
Therefore, t
here was no custodial interrogation requiring 
Miranda warnings  and advisement of a right to counsel. The 
circuit court also erred by suppressing the texts based on 
James’s Sixth Amendment and Hawaiʻi Constitution article I, 
section 14 right   to counsel.  At the time of  the text exchange, 
adversarial judicial criminal proceedings had yet to be 
initiated against James.  Therefore, his right to counsel had  
not attached.  
We also hold that 
the ICA erred by concluding it did not 
have appellate jurisdiction over the circuit court’s order 
3    
   
 
 
  
 
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
denying the State’s motion for reconsideration .   The State’s 
right to appeal from an order granting  a defendant ’s motion to 
suppress under Hawai ʻi Revised Statutes  (“HRS”) § 641-13(7)  
(2016) “encompasses a right ”  to appeal from  a related  order 
denying the State’s  motion for reconsideration.   See  State v. 
Bohannon, 102 Hawai  ʻi 228, 234, 74 P.3d 980, 986 (2003 ).  
Hence, we vacate the ICA’s May 31, 2023 judgment on appeal 
as well as the circuit court ’s March 28, 2022 findings of fact, 
conclusions of law and order granting motion to suppress text 
messages (“FOF/COL/Order”) and April 4, 2022 order denying the 
State’s motion for reconsideration.  We remand to the circuit 
court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 
  
    II. Background 
A. Factual background 
On July 2, 2015, 
James allegedly sexually assaulted CW. 
Later that day, Kaua‘i Police Department detectives Ray M. 
Takekawa (“Detective Takekawa”) and Darren Rose (“ Detective 
Rose”) (together, “the detectives”) interviewed CW. 
At the end of the interview, the detectives directed CW to 
contact James to discuss the 
alleged sexual assault.  CW was 
recorded saying to the detectives, “Wait. So, like, first I 
should just, like, get him to admit that we, like, had sex and then after that be like, well, I was like –”  CW then tried to 
call James, but he did not pick up.  CW asked the detectives, 
4    
   
 
 
 
   
  
     
 
   
 
 
                     
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
    
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
     
  
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
“Do I leave a message?” Detective Takekawa responded , “You want 
to try a text?” and Detective Rose said, “Give it a few minutes, 
about five minutes, and we’ll try one more time.” CW tried to 
call James a second time but he did not pick up. 
CW then texted James.  James responded with various texts 
to CW about the incident.  Among other things, he apparently admitted they had sex and that it was “rough.”
2 
B. Grand jury proceedings 
CW testified about the above events to a grand jury. 
On March 11, 2020, the grand jury returned an indictment 
charging James with five counts of sexual assault in the first 
degree in violation of HRS § 707-730(1)(a) (2014).3 
2 CW texted James that she was “thinking a bout the other night .” During 
the course of their text conversation, James stated, “I do remember it being 
very rough. ” When CW later texted, “You really don’t take no for an answer,” 
James responded, 
Woah! I couldn [’]t tell if you were being serious or no[t] 
to be honest . . . Thought it was some kind of ‘role 
playin[g’] or something? Sorry about that, [I] was a 
li[ttle] confused about that as well . . . . 
 . . . . 
When you were scr
eaming and crawling away by the lifeguard 
tower . . . Couldn[ ’]t tell if you were serious or w[h]at 
was goin[g on]. I was pretty confused . . . And sorry to 
put you in that situation, [it] wasn[’]t my intention at 
the time[.] 
3 HRS § 707- 730(1)(a) provided: “(1) A person commits the offense of 
sexual assault in the first degree if: (a) The person knowingly subjects 
another person to an act of sexual penetration by strong compulsion [.]”

 C. Circuit court proceedings 
1. Motion to suppress text messages  
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
   
 
  
  
      
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
On December 21, 2021, James filed a motion to suppress the 
text messages between James and CW (“motion to suppress”). 
Defense counsel initially argued the texts should be suppressed because the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and 
article I, section 7 of the Hawai‘ i Constitution ensure an 
“individual’s legitimate exp ectations of privacy will not be 
subjected to unreasonable governmental intrusions.” 
Citing State v. Kahoonei , 83 Hawai ‘i 124, 925 P.2d 294 
(1996), James argued that, under the totality of the 
circumstances, CW was acting as a government agent at the time 
she texted James. James characterized CW ’s texts as “pretext 
calls.” “Pretext calls” a re calls “made b y a witness at the 
direction of the police to a suspect or somebody else involved in the investigation. The investigators tape-record the 
telephone conversation and instruct the witness on what to say.  
The detectives use pretext calls to gather evidence and/or 
incriminating statements.” People v. Wahlert, 31 Cal. Rptr. 3d 
603, 614 (Ct. App. 4th Div. 2005) (cleaned up). James cited the Montana Supreme Court’s opinion in State v. Stewart, 291 P.3d 
1187, 1198 (Mont. 2012).  According to James, Stewart held 
“‘pretext calls’ made by the complainant to the defendant at the 
direction of a detective had violated the defendant’s right to

  4  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
privacy under the Montana constitution ” because they constituted 
state action.4 
2. Hearing on and oral order granting James’s motion to 
suppress 
At the February 24, 2022 hearing on the motion to suppress, 
the circuit court cited Kahoonei, which held that whether a 
private individual was acting as a government agent when 
effectuating a search is to be analyzed under a “totality of 
circumstances.” 83 Hawaiʻ i at 131-32, 925 P.2d at 301-02 
(holding a defendant ’s mother was a government agent when she 
retrieved a firearm and ammunition from her son’s bedroom in an 
officer’s presence after an officer told her a search warrant 
could be obtained and a search would inevitably occur).  The 
circuit court concluded CW was acting as a government agent, and 
orally granted Ja mes’s motion to suppress. 
As noted in Stewart , the Montana Supr eme Court had held in State v. 
Allen, 241 P.3d 1045 (Mont. 2010), that a defendant has a reasonable 
expectation of privacy in a cellular telephone conversation with a 
confidential police informant, and that the warrantless recordation of the 
conversation violated defendant’ s Montana constitutional right to privacy.  
Stewart, 291 P.3d at 1195. In other words, Mont ana, along with 14 other 
states, requires consent of all pa rties to a conversation for a warrantless 
recordation. See, e.g. , Stewart
, 291 P.3d at 1195. In contrast, Hawaiʻi is 
one of 36 states that does not require a search warrant when one party to a face-to-face or telephonic conversation c onsents to recordation. See, e.g., 
State v. Graham, 70 Haw. 627, 780 P.2d 1103 (1989) (holding the recording of 
a private conversatio n with the consent or cooperation of a participant is 
not subject to constitutional regulation). See generally Recording Phone 
Calls and Conversations: 50 -State Survey, JUSTIA (Jan. 2018),

3. Order granting James’s motion to suppress 
On March 28, 2022, the circuit court issued its 
FOF/COL/Order. 
The circuit court’s conclusions of law (“COLs”) were that: 
3.  Under the totality of the circumstances, the 
governmental involvement in this case was significant and
extensive enough to render CW an instrumentality of the State, i.e.  a government agent, when she called and texte
[James]. Kahoonei, 83 
Hawai‘i at  132, 925 P.3d at 302 . . 
.   
d 
. 
4.  At the point when CW called and texted [James], 
he was the only suspect and the 
investigation had focused 
on him. If the detectives had sought to question [James] 
at that point they would have been required to advise him 
of his rights, including his right to remain silent and his  
right to an   attorney, and obtain a waiver of those right[s]  
prior to proceeding with t he questioning.  Miranda v. 
Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 . . . (1966);  State v. Santiago, 53 
Haw. 254, 266, 492 P.2d 657, 665 (1971).  
 
5. As CW was acting as a government agent when she 
called an
d texted [James], the actions of the detectives 
vio
lated James[’s] right to an attorney under the [S]ixth 
[A]mendment to the U.S. Constitution and article I, section 
14 of the Hawai‘i Constitution and [James’s] right to remain 
silent under the Fifth Amendment and article I, section 10 . 
Thus, although the circuit court relied on Kahoonei , which 
was a Fourth Amendment and article I, section 7 warrantless 
search case, the circuit court based its suppression ruling on 
alleged violations of James’s Fifth Amendment and article I, 
section 10 right against self-incrimination and Sixth Amendment 
and article I, section 14 right to counsel. 
4. The State’s motion for reconsideration 
On February 28, 2022, the State had filed a motion to 
reconsider the circuit court ’s oral ruling (“motion for 
reconsideration”). The State argued that even if CW was acting 
8    
  
  
  
  
 
 
  
 
   
 
 
   
  
  
     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
as a State agent, the content of the text messages was 
admissible. It argued James had no reasonable expectation of 
privacy in his text message exchange with CW, even if she was 
acting as a State agent, so the text messages should not have 
been suppressed. 
The State pointed out that in Graham, 70 Haw. 627, 780 P.2d 
1103, this court held a recorded private conversation with the 
consent of one party (otherwise known as “consensual 
eavesdropping” or “participant monitoring”) was not a 
constitutional violation. The State also cited to State v. Roy, 
54 Haw. 513, 510 P.2d 1066 (1973), in which this court held 
there was no unconstitutional search or seizure where an 
undercover government agent entered a private home to purchase 
marijuana by invitation but without a warrant. Similar to the 
defendants in those cases, the State argued, James had no 
reasonable expectation of privacy in his text message exchange 
with CW, even if she was acting as a State agent, so the text messages should not have been suppressed. 
James’s memorandum in opposition to the State ’s motion for 
reconsideration distinguished Graham , and changed his position 
to argue he was not asserting a violation of his right to 
9    
                      
   
  
 
   
  
      
    
  
     
 
 
 
 
 5 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
privacy.   Rather,  James said he was  asserting a violation of his   
rights to counsel and to remain silent, since the polic e “used 
CW to attempt to avoid the constitutional constraints placed 
upon them if they had conducted a custodial  interrogation. ”   
James also distinguished this case from Roy, arguing that in Roy, unlike here, “there was no requirement  that the defendant 
be  advised of his rights by police.”  5
James argued Kahoonei, 83 Hawai‘i at 131, 925 P.2d at 301,  
“held that the police cannot actively re cruit a private 
individual to engage in conduct which the police would have been 
prohibited from doing.”   James argued that at the time of the 
text messages, the detectives’ investigation had focus ed solely 
on him as a suspect, and they already had probable cause to 
arrest James based on CW’s statemen ts,  so “any questioning of 
James conducted by the detectives would have constituted 
James initially based his motion to su ppress on Fourth Amendment and 
article I, section 7 grounds. In concluding James’s Miranda rights were 
violated, the circuit court cited case law construing these constitutional 
provisions. Because the issue is not properly before us, we do not a ddress 
whether James had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his text message s.  
We note that State v. Walton, 133 Hawaiʻ i 66, 93-97, 324 P.3d 876, 903- 07 
(2014), overruled some Hawaiʻ i cases h olding information voluntarily disclosed 
to third parties automatically loses article I, section 7 privacy protection; 
Walton also set forth factors courts should consider in determin ing whether a 
defendant has a legitimate expectation of privacy that information provided 
to a third party would not be shared with others, including whether that 
information reveals “ intimate details of a person ’s life.” 133 Hawai ʻi at 96-
97, 324 P. 3d at 906- 07. But consent to a search provides an e xception to the 
warrant requirement; the record suggests CW consented to the detectives 
reading her text exchange with James.  I t is not appropriate, however, for 
this court to determine as a matter of law the presence and scope of consent when it was not litigated in the trial court.  See State v. Phillips, 138 
Hawaiʻi 321, 351, 382 P.3d 133, 163 (2016). 
10    
    
  
 
 
    
 
 
  
    
    
 
  
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
‘custodial interrogation,’” and the detectives would have been 
required to advise James of his rights. James argued that, 
based on the totality of the circumstances, CW was acting as a 
government agent when she texted James. Therefore, James 
maintained, the dete ctives violated James’s right to remain 
silent under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and 
article 1, section 10 of the Hawai‘ i Constitution. 
James also asserted the detectives’  actions violated his 
right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution and article 1, section 14 of the Hawaiʻ i 
Constitution.  
At the hearing    on the State’s motion for reconsideration ,  
the State pointed out that “there is no precedent in Hawai‘i or  
anywhere else that a defendant is in cu  stody, [when] he is miles 
away from the police  [and] not incarcerated, even assuming . . . 
that the police possess probable cause to arrest.”  
On April 4, 2022, the circuit court entered an order 
denying the State’s motion for reconsideration . 
D. ICA proceedings 
On April 11, 2022, t
he State filed a notice of appeal to 
the ICA. The State asserted the circuit court erred (1) by 
finding CW induced James via text message to admit he had 
sexually assaulted her (FOF 7); (2) in concluding the detectives 
violated James’s Miranda rights under the federal and/or Hawai‘i 
11    
   
   
                     
   
     
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
constitutions because it is undisputed that James was not in  
police custody (COL 4); (3) in concluding the detectives  
violated James’s right to counsel und er the federal and/or  
Hawaiʻi constitutions because James had not yet been charge  d; (4) 
by suppressing James’s text messages sent to  CW’s phone ; and (5) 
by denying the State’s motion to reconsider .  
In its April 20, 2023 summary disposition order, the ICA 
affirmed the circuit court ’s order granting James’s motion to 
suppress. James, 2023 WL 3017974, at *7. 
Relevant here, the ICA determined it did not have appellate 
jurisdiction over the circuit court ’s order denying the State’s 
motion for reconsideration; hence, it did not address the 
State’s point of  error concerning that order .  2023 WL 3017974
, 
at *1 n.1.  The ICA reasoned that in   civil cases, under Hawai‘i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (“HRAP ”) Rule 4(a)(3) (eff  . 2020), 
a notice of appeal is “deemed to  appeal the disposition of all 
post-judgment motions that are timely filed after entry of the 
judgment or order.” James, 2023 WL 3017974, at *1 n.1  (quoting 
HRAP Rule 4(a)(3)).  HRAP Rule 4(b)  (eff. 2020) governing 6 
The ICA concluded the circuit court’s FOF 7, that CW induced James via 
text message to admit he had sex ually assaulted her, was not clearly 
erroneous. James, 2023 WL 3017974, at * 5
. This point is not at issue on 
certiorari. 
12 6    
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
appeals from criminal cases, however, does not contain a similar 
provision. James, 2023 WL 3017974, at *1 n.1. 
The ICA noted 
Miranda  warnings  are required when a 
defendant is (1) under interrogation and (2) in custody.  James, 
2023 WL 3017974, at *6 (citing State v. Ah Loo, 94 Hawaiʻi 207, 
210, 10 P.3d 728, 731 (2000)).  The ICA then said Hewitt   held 
Miranda warnings are required by article 1, section 10 o  f the 
Hawaiʻi Constitut ion whenever probable cause  to arrest has 
developed.  James, 2023 WL 3017974, at * 6 (citing  Hewitt, 153 
Hawai‘i at 36, 526 P.3d at 561).  The ICA noted the State does  
not dispute the text messages constituted “interrogation” or the 
circuit court’s   finding that at the time of the interrogation,  
James was the “only suspect” and the investigation had “focused 
on him.”    Id.   The ICA concluded that   the detectives therefore 
had probable cause to arrest James at the time of the text 
messages and that   Miranda  warnings were required before 
interrogation.   James, 2023 WL 3017974, at *6.  
The ICA also 
addressed the State’s assertion that   the text 
messages should not have been suppressed because James received 
the texts from CW, not law enforcement.  Id.   The ICA  reasoned 
the State’s position  was inconsistent with the purposes of  
Hawai‘i’s exclusionary rule.    Id.   Quoting State v. McKnight, 131 
Hawai‘i 379, 398,  319 P.3d 298, 317 (2013), the ICA noted that 
the exclusionary rule’s purposes inclu de  “(1) judicia l 
13    
   
  
  
   
  
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
integrity, (2) the protection of  individual  privacy, and (3) 
deterrence of illegal police misconduct.”   James, 2023 WL 
3017974, at *6.  The ICA determined that these purposes ar  e not 
furthered by allowing circumvention of Miranda  warnings by 
permitting law enforcement to engage in the undercover  
interrogation of suspe  cts by direct ing the sending and dictating  
the content of text messages using a government agent’s p ersonal 
mobile device.   James, 2023 WL 3017974, at *6.  
Because the ICA concluded the circuit court properly 
suppressed the text messages based on article I, section 10 of 
the Hawaiʻi Constitution, the ICA declined to address point of 
error (3) concerning James’s right to couns el. James, 2023 WL 
3017974, at *1 n.4
. 
E. Certiorari proceedings 
The State presents the following two questions on 
certiorari: whether the ICA gravely erred by concluding (1) 
Miranda warnings were required before CW, at police suggestion, 
sent text messages to James, “who was neither in proximity to a 
police officer nor confined in a correctional faci lity”; and (2) 
that it did not have appellate jurisdiction over the State’ s 
motion for reconsideration.

  III. Standards of Review 
A. Appellate jurisdiction 
 
  
 
  
  
 
 
  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
“The existence of [appellate] jurisdiction is a question of 
law and is reviewed 
de novo under the right/wrong standard. ” 
State v. Uchima, 147 Hawaiʻ i 64, 72, 464 P.3d 852, 860 (2020) 
(citation omitted). 
B. Motion to suppress 
“An appellate court reviews a ruling on a motion to 
suppress de novo  to determine whether the ruling was ‘right’ or 
‘wrong.’” Hewitt
, 153 Hawai‘i at  40, 526 P.3d at 565  (cleaned  
up). 
C. Constitutional issues 
“Questions of constitutional law are reviewed under the 
right/wrong standard. ” State v. Borge , 152 Hawaiʻi 458, 464, 526 
P.3d 435, 441 (2023) (citation omitted). 
D. Interpretation of statutes an
d court rules 
“
The interpretation of a statute [or court rule] is a 
question of law which this court reviews  de novo.” State v. 
Mortensen-Young, 152 Hawai‘i 385, 392, 526 P.3d 362, 369 (2023)  
(cleaned up).   Our statutory interpretation is guided by the 
following principles:  
First, the fundamental starting point for statutory 
interpretation is the language of the statute itself. 
Second, where the statutory language is plain and 
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain

ascertain and give effect to the intention of the 
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the 
language contained in the statute itself. Fourth, when 
there is doubt, double ness of meaning, or indistinctiveness 
or uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, an ambiguity exists. 
When there is ambiguity in a statute, the meaning of 
the ambiguous words may be sought by examining the context, with which the  ambiguous words, p hrases, and sentences may 
be compared, in order to ascertain their true meaning.   
Moreover, the courts may resort to extrinsic aids in determining legislative intent, such as legislative 
history, or the reason and spirit of the law.

    IV. Discussion 
A. Miranda warnings were not required because James was not 
“in custody” at the time of his text exchange with CW 
 The State correctly   asserts the circuit court and ICA erred 
in concluding Miranda  warnings were required  before CW texted 
James at the detectives ’  suggestion.  
 The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. C onstitution and article I, 
section 10 of the Hawai‘i Constitution guarantee the right 
against self-incrimination.  Hewitt, 153 Hawai‘ i at 43, 526 P.3d 
at 568 (citation omitted).  Miranda  warnings help safeguard this 
right:  
The  Miranda  rule is, at core, a 
constitutionally prescribed rule of evidence that 
requires the pr os
ecution to lay a sufficient 
foundation  —  i.e., that the requisite warnings were  
administered and validly waived before the accused 
16    
  
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
gave the statement sought to be adduced at trial   —  
before it may adduce evidence of a defendant’s 
custodial statements that stem from interrogation 
during [their] criminal trial.   
The prosecution’s burden of establis hing that  
the requisite warnings were gi
ven, however, is not 
triggered unless the totality of the circumstances reflect that the statement it seeks to adduce at 
trial  was obtained as a result of “custodial 
interrogation,” w hich, as  the United States Supreme 
Court defined it in Miranda , consists of “questioning 
initiated by  law enforcement offic ers after a person 
has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of their  freedom of action in any significant way.”  In 
other words, the defendant, objecting to the 
admissibility of their statement   and, thus, seeking 
to suppress it, must establish that their statement  
was the result of  (1) “interrogation” that occurred 
while they were  (2) “in custody.”  
Hewitt, 153 Hawai ‘i at 43, 526 P.3d at 568 (cleaned up). 
 Under the federal constitution,  Miranda  warnings  are 
required when a s  uspect is subjected to “custodial 
interrogation,”  which is “questioning initiated by law 
enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody  
or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any 
significant way.”   United States v.    Eide, 875 F.2d 1429, 1433 
(9th Cir. 1989) (cleaned u  p).   James was not in custody or 
otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant  
way. Thus, James was not “in custody ”  for Fifth Amendment 
purposes and Miranda  warnings were not required by t  he federal  
constitution.   
This court provides 
criminal defendants with greater 
protection under Hawai‘i’s article I, section 10 privilege 
against self-incrimination than provided by the federal courts 
17    
    
  
 
  
    
   
   
  
  
 
  
 
  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
under Miranda and its progeny. Hewitt, 153 Hawai‘ i at 44, 526 
P.3d at 569 (citation omitted).  Our Miranda rights case law, 
however, has consistently adhered to the two foundational 
requirements for Miranda rights to be triggered: 
“interrogation” and “in custody.” See, e.g., Ah Loo, 94 Hawaiʻ i 
at 210, 10 P.3d at 731 (citation omitted). 
The ICA misconstrued Hewitt and its reference to Ketchum, 
in which we held a person is “in custody ” for the purposes of 
Miranda 
rights under article I, section 10 of the Hawai‘i 
Constitution: 
[I]f an objective assessment of the totality of the 
circumstances reflects either (1) that the person has 
become impliedly accused of committing a crime because the 
questions of the police have become sustained and coercive, 
such that they are no longer reasonably designed briefly to 
confirm or dispel their reasonable suspicion or (2) that 
the point of arrest has arrived because either (a) probable 
cause to arrest has developed or (b) the police have 
subjected the person to an unlawful “ de facto ” arrest 
without probable cause to do so. 
Hewitt, 153 Hawai‘i at 43, 526 P.3d at 568 (quoting Ketchum, 97 
Hawai‘i at 126, 34 P.3d at 1025). 
The circuit court and ICA appear to have construed Hewitt  
and Ketchum  to mean that any time probable cause has developed, 
a defendant is “in custody,”   even when a defendant is nowhere 
near a law enforcement official.   In Hewitt, however,  we 
reiterated the basic framework   that “a statement made  by a 
defendant under custodial interrogation  without a Miranda  
warning must be suppressed as  unconstitutionally elicited. ”   
18    
    
   
 
  
    
 
 
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Hewitt, 153 Hawai ‘i at 43, 526 P.3d at 568 (emphasis added). Our 
analysis concerning whether Miranda warnings were required in 
Hewitt was centered on whether the defendant, who was confined 
to a hospital bed with serious injuries, was “in custody” when 
questioned by police officers. See Hewitt, 153 Hawai ‘i at 43-46, 
526 P.3d at 568-71 (holding that if a person is unable to leave a place of interrogation due to circumstances incident to 
medical treatment, determining whether the person is “in 
custody” under a to tality of circumstances for purposes of 
article I, section 10 requires an inquiry into whether the person was at liberty to terminate the interrogation and cause 
officers to leave). 
Hewitt  clearly 
reiterated that  Ketchum’s bright-line rule 
for when a suspect is “in custody” applies “ when probable cause 
to arrest exists upon an initial stop or detention.” Hewitt, 
153 Hawai‘i at 43, 526 P.3d at 568 (emphasis added) (citing  
Ketchum, 97 Hawai ‘i at 126, 34 P.3d at 1025).  Hewitt  also said  
that if a detained person’s response s  to a police officer’s 
questions provide the officer with probable cause to arrest, 
“the officer is –  at that time  –  required to inform the detained  
person”  of their Miranda  rights.   Hewitt, 153 Hawai‘ i at 43, 526 
P.3d at 568 (second  emphasis added)  (citation omitted).  
Thus, the 
Ketchum bright-line rule does not apply where 
probable cause exists but the police have not stopped or 
19    
  
 
  
 
   
 
 
    
  
 
 
                     
   
 
  
 
     
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
detained the suspect, or have not otherwise deprived the suspect 
of freedom of action in any significant way.  See Hewitt , 153 
Hawai‘i at 43, 526 P.3d at 568; Ketchum , 97 Hawai‘ i at 117-18, 34 
P.3d at 1016-
17 (“[T]he privilege against self-incrimination is 
jeopardized when an individual is taken into custody or 
otherwise deprived of [their] freedom by the authorities in any 
significant way and subjected to questioning[.]” (cleaned up)). 
Here, the detectives directed CW to contact Jam
es, and 
James apparently made incriminating statements.  CW was acting 
as a government agent, but there was no “initial stop or 
detention” or other deprivation of freedom of action at the time 
James made the statements. See Hewitt , 153 Hawai‘ i at 43, 526 
P.3d at 568; Ketchum , 97 Hawai‘i at 117-18, 34 P.3d at 1016-17.  
Therefore, regardless of whether probable cause to arrest existed at the time CW contacted James, James was not “in 
custody” and there was no “custodial ” interrogation.
7 Hence, 
Miranda warnings were not required under either the federal or state constitutions. 
The State posits that we should set forth a bright- line rule that a 
suspect must be in the presence of, or in proximity to, law enforcement or 
“confined in a correctional facility” to be “in custody.” Because we need 
not do so in this case and because it is possible to envision circumstances in which a suspect could be interrogated while deprived of freedom in a 
significant way by authorities without being in their presence, such as 
through use of technology, including electric fences, we decline to adopt the 
State’s suggestion.

B. James’s right to counsel had not attached 
Because it upheld the circuit court ’s suppression order 
based on the alleged violation of James ’s Miranda rights, the 
ICA did not address the circuit court ’s alternative ruling that 
James’s right to counsel had been violated.  James, 2023 WL 
3017974, at *1 n.4.  If James’s right to counsel was violated, 
the circuit court ’s suppression order would be affirmed on this 
alternative ground. We therefore address that issue. 
 Even when a defendant is not  subject to custodial 
interrogation:  
An individual has a right to counsel under the [S]ixth 
[A]mendment to  the United States Constitution a nd article 
I, section 14 of the  Hawaiʻi  State Constitution  which  
guarantees an accused the right to assistance of counsel 
for [the accused’ s]  defense.  However, this right attaches 
at critical stages of the criminal prosecuti on, only at or 
after the initiation of adversarial judicial criminal  
proceedings  —  whether by way of formal charge, preliminary   
hearing, indictment, information or arraignment.   
State v. Luton , 83 Hawai‘i 443, 448, 927 P.2d 844, 849 (1996) 
(cleaned up). 
Thus, the right to cou
nsel attaches only after the 
initiation of adversarial judicial criminal proceedings.  Such 
proceedings had yet to be initiated at the time of the text 
messages between CW and James.  Therefore, the circuit court 
erred by suppressing the text messages based on its erroneous 
conclusion that James was entitled to counsel under the Sixth 
Amendment and article I, section 14.

C. The ICA erred by concluding it did not have appellate 
jurisdiction over the circuit court’s order denying the 
State’s motion for reconsideration 
Finally, we also address the State’s question regarding the 
ICA’s holding that it did not have appellate jurisdiction  over 
the State’s appeal of the circuit court ’s denial of the   motion 
for reconsideration.  
The 
“right of appeal in a criminal case is purely  statutory 
and exists only when  given by some c
onstitutional or statutory 
provision.”   Bohannon, 102 Hawai‘i at 236, 74 P.3d at 988 
(citation omitted).  HRS § 641-13  enumerates when the  State may 
appeal a criminal case from the district and circuit courts.  
Bohannon,   102 Hawai‘i at 236, 74 P.3d at 988.   “As a general 
rule, we strictly construe HRS § 641-13[.]” State v. Timoteo, 
87 Hawai‘ i 108, 112, 952 P.2d 865, 869  (1997) (cleaned up).  8
However, this strict construction rule, like the rule 
applicable to penal statutes generally, does not permit the 
court to ignore legislative intent in the face of statutory 
ambiguity, nor require the court to reject the construction 
8 HRS § 641- 13 provides in relevant part: 
An appeal may be taken by and on behalf of the State from 
the district or circuit co
urts to the intermediate 
appellate court, subject to chapter 602, in all criminal 
matters, in the following instances: 
. . .. 
(7) From a pretrial order granting a motion for the 
suppression of evidence, including a confession or 
admission, or the return of property, in which case 
the appellate court shall give priority to the appeal and the order shall be stayed pending the o utcome of 
the appeal[.]

that best harmonizes with the design of the statute or the 
end sought to be achieved. 
State v. Fukusaku , 85 Hawai‘ i 462, 492, 946 P.2d 32, 62 (1997) 
(citations omitted)
. 
Section 641-13 does not expressly provide for a right of 
appeal from a motion f
or reconsideration.  
23  We agree with the State that , pursuant to  Bohanno
n, the ICA 
nonetheless had appellate jurisdiction over the circuit court  ’s  
order denying the State’s motion for reconside ration.  In 
Bohannon, the State’s notice of appeal concerning the district 
court’s order granting the defendant’s motions to  suppress and 
to dismiss did not expressly refer to the district co urt’s 
related order denying the State’s motion for reconsideration.  
102 Hawai‘i at 235, 74 P.3d at 987.  We held the  prosecution’s 
notice of appeal was nonetheless sufficient to appeal that order 
because the State’s  “intent to appeal ”  from the order denying 
its motion for reconsideration could  be “reasonably inferred 
from its notice of appeal.”   Id.   We agreed with the State that 
its “right to appeal from the order granting [ the defendant ’s] 
motion to suppress under HRS § 641-  13(7) encompasses a right to  
appeal from the order denying its motion to recon  sider the 
district court’s  order granting the moti on to suppress.”  102 
Hawai‘i at 234, 74 P.3d at 986 (cleane  d up).  We noted  that the  
district court’s order denying the motion for reconsideration    
  
  
 
 
 
 
      
   
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
was “merely an extension of its order granting [the defendant’s] 
motions to suppress and to dismiss. ” 102 Hawai‘i at 235, 74 P.3d 
at 987. 
Here, pursuant to 
Bohannon, the ICA had appellate 
jurisdiction over the circuit court’s order denying the State’s 
motion for reconsideration.  Although HRS § 641-13 does not   
expressly authorize  appeals by the State   from orders denying  
motions to reconsider   pretrial orders gra  nting the suppression 
of evidence, we have held  HRS § 641-13(7) implicitly  encompasses  
a right to appeal from  such orders.   Bohannon, 102 Hawai‘i at 
234, 74 P.3d at 986.    
The ICA determined 
it did not have jurisdiction over the 
order denying the State’s motion for reconsideration based on 
HRAP Rule 4. James, 2023 WL 3017974, at *1 n.1.  HRAP Rule 
4(a), which applies to appeals of civil cases, contains a 
provision expressly addressing post-judgment motions.  It 
provides in relevant part, 
(3) Time to appeal affected by post-judgment motions. If 
any party files a timely motion . . . to reconsider . . . 
and court or agency rules specify t he time by which the 
motion shall be filed, then the time for filing the notice 
of appeal is extended for all parties until 30 days after 
entry of an order disposing of the motion. The presiding 
court or agency in which the motion was filed shall dispose of any such post -judgment motion by entering an order upon 
the record within 90 days after the date the motion was 
filed. If the court or agency fails to enter an order on the record, then, within 5 days after the 90th day, the 
clerk of the relevant court or agency shall notify the 
parties that, by operation of thi s Rule, the post- judgment 
motion is denied and that any orders entered thereafter 
shall be a nullity. The time of appeal shall run from the 
date of entry of the c ourt or agency’s order disposing of

the post- judgment motion, if the order is entered within 
the 90 days, or from the filing date of the cle rk’s notice 
to the parties that the post- judgment motion is denied 
pursuant to the operation of the Rule.
 The notice of appeal shall be deemed  to appeal the 
disposition of all post -judgment motions that are timely 
filed after entry of the judgment or order.  
      The 90 -day period shall be computed as provided in 
Rule 26 of  these Rules.  
HRAP Rule 4(b),  which applies to appeals of criminal cases, 
contains no similar provision.  9
9HRAP Rule 4(b) provides in full: 
(b) Appeals in criminal cases.
 (1) Time for filing. In a criminal case, the notice 
of appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the 
judgment or order appealed from. However, if the notice of 
appeal is mailed, the notice of appeal shall be deemed 
timely filed if the mailing is postmarked within the time fixed for filing and is received by the clerk no later than 
5 days after the postmarked date. For the purposes of 
calculating o ther deadlines in these Rules, the date of 
filing under this Rule shall be the date the document is received by the clerk.
      A motion for leave to file an interlocutory appeal 
from an order of the circuit court must be filed within 30 
days of the court’s entry of the order. If such a motion 
is filed and granted, then the notice of appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry o f the circuit court’s 
order granting permission for leave to file an 
interlocutory appeal. 
(2) Effect of motions in arrest of judgment or for 
new trial. If a timely motion in arrest of judgment under 
Rule 34 of the Hawai ʻi Rules of Penal Procedure or for a new 
trial under Rule 33 of the Hawa i‘i Rules of Penal Procedure 
has been made, an appeal from a judgment of conviction may 
be taken within 30 days after the entry of any order denying the motion.
 (3) Entry of judgment or order defined. A judgment 
or order is entered within the meaning of this subsection 
when it is filed with the clerk of the court.
 (4) Premature notice of appeal. A notice of appeal 
filed after the announcement of a decision, sentence or order but before entry of the judgment or order shall be 
deemed to have been filed on the date such judgment or 
order is entered.
 (5) Extensions of time to file a notice of appeal. 
Upon showing of good cause, the circuit, district, or 
family court may, no later than 30 days after the time has

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
HRAP Rule 4(b), however, merely governs timing requirements 
for filing appeals in criminal cases.  See Bohannon, 102 Hawai‘ i 
at 235, 74 P.3d at 987. In this case, there is no 
jurisdictional issue related to the timing of the State’s filing 
of the notice of appeal.10 The State ’s April 11, 2022 notice of 
appeal expressly and timely appealed both the March 28, 2022 order granting James’s motion to suppress and the April 4, 2022 
order denying the State’s motion for reconsideration. And 
pursuant to Bohannon , HRS § 641-13(7 ) “encompasses a right ” for 
the State to appeal from the circuit court’s order denying the 
State’s motion for reconsideration. See Bohannon
, 102 Hawai‘i at 
234, 74 P.3d at 986. 
Therefore, the 
ICA erred in ruling it lacked appellate 
jurisdiction over the circuit c ourt’s order denying the State’s 
motion for reconsideration of the order granting motion to suppress. Based on our reasoning in Sections IV.A and B above, 
(. . .continued) 
expired, on motion and notice, extend the time for filing a 
notice of appeal for a period not to exceed 30 days from 
the expiration of the time otherwise prescribed by this 
subdivision (b). Any such motion that is filed before 
expiration of the prescribed time may be ex parte unless the court otherwise requires. 
As noted supra, the State filed its notice of appeal on April 11, 2022, 
less than 30 days after the filing of both the circuit court’s order granting 
James’s motion to suppress the text messages (filed on March 28, 2022) and 
order denying the State’s related motion for reconsider ation (filed on April 
4, 2022). See HRAP Rule 4(b)(1). 
26 10    
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the circuit court also erred by denying the State’s motion for 
reconsideration. 
V. Conclusion 
For the reasons explained above, we vacate the ICA’s May 
31, 2023 judgment on appeal as well as the circuit cou  rt’s  March 
28, 2022 FOF/COL/Order  and April 4, 2022 order denying the 
State’s motion fo r reconsideration.  We remand to the circuit 
court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
