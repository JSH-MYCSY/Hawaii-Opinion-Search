AND GINOZA, J., DISSENTING, WITH WHOM RECKTENWALD, C.J., JOINS 
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY EDDINS, J. 
I. 
During closing argument in this sexual assault case, the 
prosecution told the jury that its decision “comes to one 
question. 
Is [complaining witness] believable?” Then, while  
 
  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
discussing the court’s credibility instruction, the prosecution 
explained that the witness’ testimony “is consistent with 
someone who’s been traumatized.” 
Recently we vacated a conviction in a sexual assault case 
after the prosecution during closing argument told the jury that 
its decision “comes down to one question, is [complaining witness] believable?” Then, while discussing the court’s 
credibility instruction explained that the witness’ testimony 
“is consistent with a child who is traumatized.” State v.
Hirata, 152 Hawaiʻ i 27, 29, 520 P.3d 225, 227 (2022).  This court 
held that the “traumatized” statement was prosecutorial 
misconduct that eroded the defendant’s constitutional right to a 
fair trial. Id. at 33, 520 P.3d at 231. 
In the present case, the Intermediate Court of Appeals 
validated the prosecutor’s remarks. We do not. 
The prosecuting attorney crossed the line in Hirata. Here 
too. The remarks constituted prosecutorial misconduct. 
We hold that the prosecuting attorney expressed a personal 
belief about the witness’ credibility and added new evidence during closing argument, thereby undermining the defendant’s 
right to a fair trial. 
II. 
The State alleges that Zeth Browder sexually assaulted the 
complaining witness (CW) (an identifier commonly used in 
2  
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Hawaiʻi’s trial courts), an elderly woman, while she was camping 
in her tent in a county park. 
The State charged Browder by indictment. It alleged he 
committed first degree sexual assault, Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes 
(HRS) § 707-730(1)(a) (2014), third degree sexual assault, HRS 
§ 707-732(1)(f) (2014), first degree burglary, HRS § 708
-
810(1)(c) (2014), kidnapping, HRS § 707-720(1)(e) (2014), and evidence tampering, HRS § 710-1076(1)(a) (2014). 
Third Circuit Court Judge Robert Kim presided over 
Browder’s trial. The trial occurred two years after Chanse 
Hirata’s continuous sexual assault of a minor trial, and one 
year before this court’s Hirata opinion. 
The same deputy prosecuting attorney tried both cases. 
The jury found Browder guilty of all charges. 
Browder appealed. He raised multiple points of error. 
The ICA vacated Browder’s conviction and ordered a new 
trial based on other comments the prosecutor made during closing argument. The State didn’t appeal the ICA’s decision on those 
comments. Nor did it appeal the ICA’s conclusion that those comments may have affected the trial’s outcome and therefore 
Browder should be retried. 
The ICA rendered a split decision on the prosecutor’s 
“consistent with someone who’s been traumatized” comment. The 
majority held that the statement was not misconduct. Judge 
3  
 
   
 
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Leonard disagreed, saying the remark mirrored the one this court 
found improper in Hirata. Browder appealed on this issue. We 
accepted cert to examine the ICA majority’s view that the 
prosecutor’s “traumatized” comment was permissible. 
Thus, the only issue before us is whether the prosecutor’s 
“consistent with someone who’s been traumatized” comment was prosecutorial misconduct. So we limit our recitation of the 
facts. 
Browder’s case went to trial in late 2021. The State 
called several witnesses who interacted with the woman after the 
alleged crime: the first person she reported the assault to, two 
responding police officers, two detectives, and a nurse who 
performed a sexual assault examination. Each witness described the woman as distressed, using words like “scared,” “crying,” 
“very emotional,” and “shooken up” to describe her demeanor. 
The CW testified. The defense’s cross-examination aimed to 
highlight purported inconsistencies in her prior statements. 
Before the closing arguments, the court read the standard 
instruction about witness credibility. See
 Hawaiʻi Standard Jury 
Instructions Criminal 3.09. 
The prosecutor’s closing referenced the credibility factors 
in the jury instruction. 
She described the CW’s testimony as 
“emotional,” “crying,” and “scared.” Then, like in Hirata, the 
4  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
   
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
    
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
prosecutor declared that the CW’s manner of testifying was 
“consistent with” a “traumatized” person. 
The complaining witness in Browder’s case is an elderly 
woman. In Hirata, the complaining witness was a child. That 
difference is inconsequential. 
Browder’s case and Hirata have four key similarities. 
First, the prosecution told the jurors that the case turned on 
credibility. Hirata, 152 Hawaiʻ i at 29, 520 P.3d at 227. 
Second, witnesses testified that the child and elderly woman 
were highly emotional during post-assault interactions. 
Third, 
the child and elderly woman testified in highly emotional ways. Id. Fourth, the prosecutor’s closing arguments described the 
complaining witness’ testimony as “consistent with” a traumatized person. 
Here is what the prosecutor said in both cases: 
Hirata, 152 Hawaiʻ i at 29, 520 
P.3d at 227:  
This case (emphasis added) : 
. . . . And it also comes down to one . . . . [U]ltimately this case comes 
question, is [CW] believable? to one question. Is [CW] believable? 
Now, the Court gave you the jury Now, [the Circuit Court] just read 
instructions that you all have in you a number of jury instructions,

So you look at their demeanor, their

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
believable, it ’s – it is the 
testimony that has a convincing force 
upon you that counts, and the 
testimony of even a single witness, 
if believed, can be sufficient to prove a fact. 
So let’s go through the factors of 
[CW]’s credibility. Her appearance, 
demeanor, her manner of testifying. 
She came here last week. You saw 
her. She’ s 11 years old. She was 
nervous and understandably so. And 
she tried to be brave up there on the 
stand. She answered all of my 
questions. She answered all of the 
defense attorney’ s questions. Almost 
three hours up there. 
And then at the end of almost those 
three hours, she couldn’ t be brave 
anymore, and you saw her when she got 
emotional. She broke when the 
defense attorney continued to call – to question her credibility and if she was making this up, and her 
answer to you was this really 
happened. It’ s consistent with a 
child who is traumatized. stated on page 11 of your jury 
instructions, the testimony of even a 
single witness if believed is 
sufficient to prove a fact. 
So now let’ s look a little bit closer 
at the credibility factors and the 
evidence that you heard over the last 
week. 
So looking at [CW]’ s appearance, 
demeanor, manner of testifying you 
saw her and you got to meet her over 
the course of two days of 
questioning. 
She’s 80 years old. She was nervous, 
shaking on the witness stand. She 
was emotional and crying. She was 
scared. She told you she was scared 
that morning. She was scared at the 
hospital. She was scared even a week 
and a half later, and she was still scared in court. This is consistent 
with someone who’ s been traumatized. 
The ICA’s majority (and the dissent) believe the summations 
meaningfully differ, making the appellate outcomes differ. We 
held in Hirata that the “consistent with a child who is traumatized” remark improperly expressed the prosecutor’s 
personal belief and improperly introduced new evidence during 
closing argument. Hirata
, 152 Hawaiʻi at 33, 520 P.3d at 231. 
The ICA views Browder’s case as different. It said, “the 
prosecutor’s argument. . . was not based on the prosecutor’s own 
evaluation and opinion of CW’s reaction to being cross-examined, 
as in 
Hirata, but was supported by reference to the evidence or 
facts supporting the assertion” (cleaned up). 
6  
 
  
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The ICA felt the prosecutor did not express a personal 
opinion related to the witness’ credibility. Rather, telling 
the jury that the complainant testified consistent-with-a-
traumatized-person was just an evidence-rooted inference. The 
ICA referenced several witnesses who described the woman as 
“crying,” “scared,” “sad,” and “very shaky.” In the ICA majority’s view, that evidence of post-assault emotion flips the 
outcome. 
Judge Leonard doesn’t see the difference. Like we do here, 
her concurrence split-screens passages from the closing 
arguments, placing the closings side-by-side. She reasoned that 
Hirata “is indistinguishable from this case with respect to the 
prosecutor’s statement to the jury that the complaining witness’s . . . appearance, demeanor, and manner of testifying 
was consistent with someone who’s been traumatized.” To Judge 
Leonard, “[t]he rule of law applied to the prosecutor in Hirata 
is equally applicable to her in this case.” 
It is. We hold that the prosecuting attorney’s consistent-
with-someone-who’s-been-traumatized remark expressed a personal 
belief about the credibility of the State’s key witness and 
undermined Browder’s right to a fair trial. The remark also 
resulted in a constitutionally unfair trial because prosecutors “are also forbidden from introducing new information or evidence 
7  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
in closing argument.” Hirata, 152 Hawaiʻ i at 33, 520 P.3d at 
231. 
III. 
 A. State v. Hirata 
Hirata held that a near-identical “consistent with someone 
who’s been traumatized” remark was prosecutorial misconduct. 
152 Hawaiʻ i at 33, 520 P.3d at 231.  Hirata
 gave two independent 
reasons. 
First, a prosecuting attorney’s personal views about the 
evidence are out-of-bounds. “[T]his court has often directed 
prosecutors to not express personal beliefs about the evidence.” 
Id. See also State v. Salavea, 147 Hawaiʻ i 564, 582, 465 P.3d 
1011, 1029 (2020) (prosecutors must “refrain from expressing 
their personal views as to a defendant’s guilt or the credibility of witnesses”). 
A prosecutor’s assertions of 
personal knowledge “are apt to carry much weight against the accused when they should properly carry none.” State v. Clark, 
83 Hawaiʻ i 289, 304, 926 P.2d 194, 209 (1996).  
8  Second, prosecutors “are also forbidden from introducing 
new information or evidence in closing argument.” Hirata, 152 
Hawaiʻi at 33, 520 P.3d at 231 (emphasis added); see also State
v. Basham, 132 Hawaiʻ i 97, 113, 319 P.3d 1105, 1121 (2014)  
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(“Closing arguments are not the place to introduce new evidence 
outside the safeguards of the Hawaiʻ i Rules of Evidence.”). 
Hirata drew on this court’s decisions in Salavea and 
Basham, which in turn relied on the American Bar Association 
(ABA) Standards for Criminal Justice. Salavea, 147 Hawaiʻ i at 
582 n.23, 465 P.3d at 1029 n.23; Basham, 132 Hawaiʻ i at 114-15, 
319 P.3d at 1122-23. 
The ABA Standards state that arguing from 
personal belief and adding new evidence are separate reasons to 
find misconduct. “The prosecutor should not argue in terms of 
counsel’s personal opinion, and should not imply special or 
secret knowledge of the truth or of witness credibility.” ABA 
Standard 3-6.8(b) (emphasis added). When prosecutors imply 
secret knowledge, they imply extra facts not in evidence. 
Hirata held that a prosecutor’s remark is improper if it 
expresses a personal belief about a witness’ credibility 
or 
introduces new evidence, not just when it expresses a personal 
belief about credibility and introduces new evidence. The 
prosecuting attorney in Hirata “improperly expressed her 
personal belief about CW’s credibility and injected new 
evidence.” Hirata
, 152 Hawaiʻi at 33, 520 P.3d at 231 (emphasis 
added). Both reasons were independent grounds to find 
prosecutorial misconduct. Contrary to the dissent and ICA, a 
prosecutor’s improper personal belief is not cured because it 
was supported by evidence. See id.
 at 35, 520 P.3d at 233 (“[A] 
9  
 
  
 
  
 
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
statement may improperly imply a personal opinion even if 
specific facts or evidence are invoked.”) (cleaned up). 
Witness observations about an alleged victim’s emotional 
state do not justify a prosecutor’s suggestion to the jury that 
the victim testified truthfully because she was “traumatized.” 
They did not in Hirata. And they do not here. The Hirata jury heard from the CW, the person who the CW first disclosed the 
sexual abuse to (the child’s mother), a police officer, a 
detective, a doctor, and an expert on the dynamics of child 
sexual abuse. Hirata, 152 Hawaiʻ i at 29, 520 P.3d at 227. 
The witnesses described the child in post-assault interactions 
as “scared” and “crying.” 
That evidence was available to the 
jury in Hirata
. Still Hirata concluded that the prosecutor’s 
comment was misconduct. 
B. Browder’s Case 
Hirata
 held that the “consistent with” a “traumatized” 
person remark was improper for both reasons – improper personal 
opinion and new evidence during closing. 152 Hawaiʻi at 33, 520 
P.3d at 231. 
There’s no difference in Browder’s case. Hirata
 controls. 
In both cases, the jury listened as the DPA claimed that 
the alleged victim testified “consistent with someone who’s been 
traumatized.” But, as in Hirata, the jury heard no evidence 
10  
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
that could legitimately support the prosecutor’s claim that the 
CW testified consistent with a traumatized person. Id.
Like Hirata, there was no evidence about post-assault 
“trauma” or evidence regarding the condition or state of being 
“traumatized.” Id.There was extensive evidence about the 
witness’ demeanor, her distraught emotional state. But there 
was nothing to establish “trauma” as a concept or to diagnose 
the witness with being traumatized. Nor was there foundation 
for the idea that the CW remained “traumatized” when she 
testified two and a half years after the alleged sexual assault. 
There was also no evidence about how a traumatized person may or 
may not testify or act while testifying. See id. at 33 n.14, 
520 P.3d at 231 n.14. 
Hirata had an expert who testified generally about the 
dynamics of child sexual abuse, but did not opine specifically 
on how traumatized children testify in court or on that case’s 
individual child. Id.The Hirata jury could apply the expert’s 
general testimony to the evidence it heard. 
Here, there was less for the jury to consider, because 
there was no expert. This jury lacked any expert psychological testimony to go on. This jury could only rely on its own 
preexisting ideas of what “trauma” is and what effects, psychological or otherwise, it has on someone who has been 
11  
 
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
“traumatized.” Thus, the prosecutor’s comment had less support 
in this case than it did in Hirata. 
“Trauma,” and the state of being “traumatized,” are loaded 
terms. They mean more than distraught or upset. They mean more 
than a person showing emotional distress, such as by crying or 
shaking. They connote a lasting psychological condition. 
The State, in its briefing to the ICA in this case, defined 
trauma as “Psychiatry. A startling experience which has a lasting effect on mental life; a shock.” Trauma, The Random 
House Dictionary of the English Language, 1507 (The Unabridged Edition 1973). The State also defined trauma as “Psychiatry. A 
painful emotional experience, or shock, often producing a 
lasting psychic effect.” Trauma, Webster’s New World 
Dictionary, 1423 (Third College Edition, 1988). More modern 
dictionaries define it as “a disordered psychic or behavioral 
state resulting from severe mental or emotional stress or 
physical injury.” Trauma, Merriam Webster Dictionary. 
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trauma [https://perma.cc/DQH6-EG59]. Or, “[s]evere emotional or mental 
distress caused by an experience.” Trauma, The American 
Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 2022. https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=trauma [https://perma.cc/P9S3-PZ3Q]. 
12  
 
  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
“Trauma,” and the state of being “traumatized,” have a 
specialized psychological meaning. The Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), describes 
several kinds of traumatic psychological conditions, which can 
present with varying symptoms. American Psychiatric 
Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 265-290 (5th ed. 2013). For example, post-traumatic 
stress disorder, which can result in long-term effects after 
exposure to sexual violence. Id. at 271-80. 
“Trauma” or “traumatized” doesn’t always mean exactly one 
thing. Id.In some cases, survivors of sexual violence behave 
with an unemotional, calm demeanor. See People v. Taylor, 552 
N.E.2d 131, 133-34 (N.Y. 1990) (citing Ann Burgess & Lynda Holmstrom, Rape Trauma Syndrome, 131 Am. J. Psychiatry 981, 982 
(1974)). Emotionless self-presentation may also be “consistent 
with someone who’s been traumatized.” See Taylor, 552 N.E.2d at 
134 (“It is also apparent that there is no single typical profile of a rape victim and that different victims express 
themselves and come to terms with the experience of rape in 
different ways.”). 
The phrasing of the prosecutor’s comment contributes to its 
impropriety. “Consistent with” sounds like expert-speak. In this case, the State’s medical expert, Nurse Davis, opined that 
the CW’s description of the assault was “consistent with” the 
13  
 
   
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
results of Davis’ medical examination. “Consistent with” 
prompts a jury to think of “traumatized” in technical, medical, 
and diagnostic terms. Not the supposedly common-sense meaning 
the dissent claims. 
“Consistent with” also suggests facts not in evidence. For 
a witness’ behavior to be “consistent with someone who’s been traumatized,” some behaviors must be consistent with trauma. 
Trauma also must have some relevance. In short, “trauma,” and 
being “traumatized,” must mean something. The prosecutor’s 
comment invites the jury to supply its own meaning outside of 
properly admitted evidence. 
For sure, a prosecutor during closing argument “is 
permitted to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence and wide latitude is allowed in discussing the evidence.” Clark
, 83 
Hawaiʻi at 304, 926 P.2d at 209.  Free-flowing syntax often adds 
flair to a closing argument. But here, the consistent-with-a
-
traumatized-person comment was not improvised or extemporaneous. Rather, it was deliberate. As in Hirata, the remarks boosted 
the CW’s credibility. 
Examining the persuasive impact of “consistent with someone 
who’s been traumatized” shows why it is out of bounds. It 
invokes, for a juror familiar with trauma, that trauma may cause 
lapses in memory. See, e.g., Arthur H. Garrison, Rape Trauma
Syndrome: A Review of a Behavioral Science Theory and its 
14  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Admissibility in Criminal Trials, 23 Am. J. Trial Advoc. 591, 
619 (2000) (summarizing academic studies). A knowledgeable 
juror may discount any gaps or inconsistencies they perceive in 
the CW’s testimony. 
A juror without that background may view the testimony 
differently. See Taylor, 552 N.E.2d at 136 (“[W]e believe that 
patterns of response among rape victims are not within the 
ordinary understanding of the lay juror.”). Without an expert 
to explain the impacts, signs, and symptoms of trauma and to 
opine on whether the CW exhibits trauma, each juror may 
interpret the prosecutor’s remark differently based on their 
individual experience. See id. (“[C]ultural myths still affect 
common understanding of rape and rape victims.”). 
Because an ordinary juror may hold myths or misconceptions 
about the trauma-infused testimony of sexual assault survivors, 
State v. David is inapposite. That case held that requiring 
expert testimony to introduce evidence about (1) blood alcohol 
concentration’s connection to alcohol consumption and (2) the 
association between alcohol consumption and aggressive behavior 
undercut the defendant’s right to present a defense. State v.
David
, 149 Hawaiʻi 469, 477, 481, 494 P.3d 1202, 1210, 1214 
(2021). BAC and the relationship between alcohol and aggression 
are within the common knowledge of the average adult. Id.
Thus, this court concluded that jurors should apply “their 
15  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
general knowledge of how humans operate in the world.” Id. at 
478, 494 P.3d at 1211. 
David is different. Ordinary adults understand the effects 
of alcohol. Many – we suspect most - adults don’t have 
experience listening to a rape survivor recount their 
experience. An adult’s common knowledge does not include how sexual assault survivors testify in a public courtroom. That 
experience is more specific than the average adult’s “general 
knowledge of how humans operate in the world.” Id.
The dissent’s fundamental premise is that an adult sexual 
assault survivor’s manner of testifying is within the average 
adult’s common understanding. We don’t share that view. 
The dissent also seeks to separate this case from Hirata 
because the prosecutor’s traumatized comment was “thoroughly supported by evidence” and because the defense attacked CW’s 
credibility. This is no distinction at all. The prosecutor and 
defense attorney in Hirata did the same things. 
After the “traumatized” comment, the Hirata prosecutor 
described evidence from other witnesses about the CW’s post-
assault emotional state: “She was upset, emotional;” “[s]he was 
nervous. She was quiet, withdrawn;” “[s]he broke down. She was 
crying, and she was weeping.” The prosecutor also described evidence about CW’s physical injuries. 
16  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The dissent canvasses the transcript here and concludes 
that the prosecutor’s discussion of the evidence justified her 
“traumatized” comment. It quotes Salavea: “A statement about a 
witness’s credibility that is made without reference to the 
evidence or facts supporting the assertion amounts to an 
expression of personal opinion.” 147 Hawaiʻ i at 582, 465 P.3d at 
1029. 
But Salavea
’s statement doesn’t mean that if a prosecutor 
assembles some evidence, then any personal opinion is allowed. 
Closing arguments frame facts. In almost any trial where a 
prosecutor makes a prejudicial remark, the comment will be 
tethered to the facts in some way. 
Here, we decline to greenlight a prosecutor’s prejudicial 
comment just because the prosecutor detailed facts about an 
adult’s emotional state. 
The dissent also concludes that because Browder’s counsel 
attacked CW’s credibility, the prosecutor’s “traumatized comment 
was appropriate.” In Hirata, defense counsel also questioned the CW’s credibility: “[T]he first thing let’s talk about is the 
reason. . . why [CW] said what she said. . . . [I]t’s attention 
from her mom.” The defense continued: “So caution, jurors, just 
because [CW] said it doesn’t make it true.” “[L]et’s talk about 
some of the inconsistencies” in the CW’s testimony. 
In this case, defense counsel attacked the CW in stark 
terms, accusing her of “lying.” We do not condone counsel’s use 
17  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
of the words “lie” and “lying.” See State v. Austin , 143 Hawaiʻi 
18, 50–51, 422 P.3d 18, 50–51 (2018) (opinion of the Court by 
Pollack, J.) (recognizing many problems with a prosecutor’s 
assertion that a witness was lying). Still, we believe that the 
defense’s objectionable word choices do not validate the 
prosecutor’s improper argument. And, the defense’s credibility 
challenge does not separate this case from 
Hirata. 
Challenging the credibility of prosecution witnesses is a 
routine feature of most criminal trials. Not challenging the credibility of a witness may lead to claims that defense 
counsel’s representation fell below an objective standard of 
reasonableness. The right to cross-examination, and a closing 
argument that questions credibility, does not pave the way for 
prejudicial prosecutorial commentary. 
Here, the “traumatized” comment also adds evidence that the 
assault occurred as the CW described it. Evidence of the CW’s 
emotional behavior, combined with the prosecutor’s “traumatized” comment, suggests that the CW was in fact traumatized. So, the 
CW must have experienced a traumatic event, a juror may think. 
Thus, the CW’s psychological condition becomes more evidence 
supporting her description of the sexual assault. And, it 
resembles prejudicial victim-impact evidence. Hirata
, 152 
Hawaiʻi at 35, 520 P.3d at 233.  
18  
 
  
  
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Contrary to the dissent’s reading, we do not encourage a 
prosecution expert to discuss CW’s “trauma” in every sexual 
assault case. Hirata expressed concern that, in many cases, 
evidence of CW’s trauma may be impermissible victim-impact evidence. Id. at 33 n.13, 520 P.3d at 231 n.13. 
The prosecutor’s diagnostic and causal opinion about trauma 
may carry undue weight. A prosecutor’s words have an outsized influence on a jury. Id. at 33, 520 P.3d at 231. The 
prosecutor’s personal opinion, enhanced by their experience in sex-crimes cases, enters the jury’s decision-making calculus. 
See Salavea, 147 Hawaiʻ i at 582, 465 P.3d at 1029 (prosecutor’s 
personal opinions “tend to exploit the influence of the prosecutor’s office”); Clark, 83 Hawaiʻ i at 304, 926 P.2d at 209 
(“[I]mproper suggestions, insinuations, and especially 
assertions of personal knowledge are apt to carry much weight 
against the accused when they should properly carry none.”). 
Trust me, the prosecutor says, I know what a traumatized person 
looks and acts like. 
But Hirata recognized that a prosecutor’s consistent with a 
traumatized person comment requires evidentiary support. There, the prosecutor’s “traumatized” comment lacked “evidence that 
could legitimately support” it because “[n]o witness testified 
about CW’s mental health or psychological condition.” Hirata

This court has recognized that expert testimony on the 
dynamics of sexual abuse “may play a particularly useful role by 
disabusing the jury of some widely held misconceptions so that 
it may evaluate the evidence free of the constraints of popular 
myths.” See State v. Batangan, 71 Haw. 552, 558, 799 P.2d 48, 
52 (1990) (cleaned up). Expert testimony can assist the jury in 
applying technical psychological concepts. But injecting the 
concept of “trauma” and the diagnosis that a witness has been 
“traumatized” without supporting expert testimony asks the jury 
to draw on popular myths, not avoid them. 
Prosecutors have “a duty to seek justice, to play fair and 
square.” Hirata, 152 Hawaiʻ i at 33, 520 P.3d at 231.  Since 
statehood, this court has fiercely protected a criminal defendant’s constitutional right to a fair trial. See State v.
Yoshino, 50 Haw. 287, 290, 439 P.2d 666, 669 (1968). We do so again. 
IV. 
We vacate the part of the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ 
memorandum opinion that allowed the prosecutor to say that the 
witness testified “consistent with someone who’s been
