IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI
ʻI 
IN THE MATTER OF THE TAX APPEAL OF HAWAIIAN AIRLINES, INC.,  
Petitioner/Plaintiff-Appellant,  
 
vs.  
 
DEPARTMENT OF TAXATION,  
Respondent/Defendant-Appellee.  
CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS  
(CAAP-22-0000349; CIV. NO. 1CTX-21-0000493)  
 
ORDER  OF CORRECTION  
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., McKenna, Eddins, Ginoza, and Devens, JJ.)  
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Opinion of the Court, filed 
on October 7, 2024 , is corrected as follows: 
On page 5, line 5, the case name citation shall be changed 
from “Grace” to “Grace II.”  
 On page 6, on the sixth line of the first full paragraph, 
the word “final” is to be replaced by the word “formal” and the 
line shall read as follows: “have qualified as formal 
administrative decisions, the NOPA”.  
On page 36, footnote 13 shall be corrected to read as 
follows with underlined material added: 
It was also pointed out at oral argument, however, that 
while the State could owe interest of four percent on taxes 
refunded to taxpayers, HRS § 231 -23(d)(1)(B), taxpayers 
could owe eight percent interest on amounts due, assessable 
from the due date of the original return. HRS § 231 - 
  
 
  
 
 
  
 
  
 
    
       
      
      
      39(b)(4)(A). By making its payment under protest when it 
did, it appears Hawaiian halted the accrual of the eight 
percent interest earlier than if it had waited for the 
final assessment, in the event its appeal was eventually 
denied. 
On page 37, the second to last two sentences of the only 
full paragraph on the page shall be corrected to read as follows 
with bracketed material deleted and underlined material added:  
Moreover, Section VII of the TBOR, quoted above, clearly 
says that, “in lieu of filing an appeal,” a taxpayer can 
make a payment under protest [“within 30 days from the date 
the Final Notice of Assessment was mailed.” That is the 
deadline, suggesting that the payment under protest must be 
filed before  that deadline.] “ and seek to recover the taxes 
by filing an action in tax appeal court within 30 days from 
the date of payment .”  
On page 38, the first full paragraph shall be corrected to 
read as follows with bracketed material deleted and underlined 
material added:  
Hence, [the NOPA constitutes a “tax assessment”] even 
though a taxpayer need not make payment until after the 
final assessment [. A], a NOPA qualifies as a “[final] 
formal administrative decision” required by Grace II to 
invoke HRS § 40 -35 jurisdiction . 
The Clerk of the Court is directed to take all necessary 
steps to notify the publishing agencies of this change.
