 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
I. 
Hawaiʻi’s workers
’ compensation law allows an employee to 
appeal a decision by the Director of the Department of Labor and 
Industrial Relations (Director) to the Labor and Industrial 
Relations Appeal Board (LIRAB). Like most appeals, there’s a 
deadline. The employee must file a notice of appeal “within 
twenty days after a copy [of the decision] has been sent” to the 
employee. Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386-87(a) (2015). 
In this case, a self-represented claimant tried to appeal 
the Director’s decision to the LIRAB. 
The LIRAB refused to hear 
the case. According to the board, the employee missed the 
deadline by one day. 
The employee appealed. The Intermediate Court of Appeals 
sided with the LIRAB. 
A party’s twenty-day appeal clock begins when the 
Department of Labor and Industrial Relations sends a decision. We hold that the LIRAB, the agency rejecting an appeal as 
untimely based on the Department’s “sent” date, must have direct 
evidence that the decision was sent on that date. In this case, 
the LIRAB did not have sufficient evidence. 
We vacate the ICA’s summary disposition order. The 
employee may appeal to the LIRAB.

II. 
Since this appeal concerns jurisdiction, the underlying 
factual and legal circumstances are mostly immaterial. Former 
elementary school teacher Augustina Dean filed a workers’ 
compensation claim. 
 Dean filed her request to the Director of the Department of 
Labor and Industrial Relations through the Department’s Disability Compensation Division (DCD).  Per HRS § 386-71 (2015), the Director heard Dean’s claim.   Dean maintained she 
had suffered a work-related injury. 
Dean did not, the Director found. Dean then appealed to 
the LIRAB. See HRS § 386-87. 
The LIRAB held a trial. Dean represented herself. The 
appeal board reversed the Director’s decision. It ordered a new hearing. The Director held one on February 8, 2022. 
On March 9, 2022, following that hearing, the Director 
entered a new decision awarding Dean $2,424.24 for “1% permanent partial disability of the whole person,” and “medical care, 
services and supplies as the nature of the injury may require.” 
The Director’s decision totaled five pages. The last page 
detailed the director’s conclusion, its “Decision and Order.”

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
It was dated March 9, 2022. At the bottom of that page were the 
words: 
The record also contains a one-page document: 
The document preprints words that surround a forward slash, 
“Date of Decision/Date Mailed:.” One inputted date, 3/9/2022, 
follows two events. A person (position unidentified and name 
redacted) “processed” the document. 
It is not clear from the record whether DCD included this 
document in its mailing to Dean. Without it, Dean would not have received any document even purporting to convey when the 
4  
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
decision was sent. This would raise serious due process 
concerns. See State v. Bani, 97 Hawaiʻ i 285, 296, 36 P.3d 1255, 
1266 (2001) (due process requires notice and an opportunity to 
be heard). 
Since the record is unclear on this point, we base 
our decision on other grounds. 
On March 30, 2022, the LIRAB received a two-page facsimile 
(common in late 20th century offices, “a system of transmitting and reproducing graphic matter . . . by means of signals sent 
over telephone lines.” Merriam–Webster, 
https://www.merriam-
webster.com/dictionary/facsimile [https://perma.cc/9KX6-C8FS]). From her residence in Arkansas, Dean faxed a cover sheet, and on 
a separate page hand-wrote that she wanted to appeal. 
According to the LIRAB, Dean missed the deadline. By one 
day. (March 9, 2022 decision sent + 20 days = March 29, 2022 deadline.) 
On May 11, 2022, the LIRAB issued an Order to Show Cause. 
The LIRAB asked Dean to explain “why this appeal, filed on March 
30, 2022 should not be dismissed as untimely.” 
 Dean responded. After receiving the order, she reached out 
to a DCD contact: 
I did not receive decision letter from DCD for over 3 weeks 
after the hearing.  I called and wrote email to facilitator 
and hearing officer regarding the mail that did not reach 
me.  
 
Resending me emails and mailing me decision letter took 
long time.  [DCD contact] advised me to send appeal before 
the end of the month. I responded immediately and sent it 
on  the 30th  of April, [sic]  2022.  Due to the delays and 
5  
  
 The LIRAB refused to review Dean’s workers’ compensation 
claim appeal. It was too late. Citing Kissell v. Lab. & Indus.
Rels. Appeals Bd., 57 Haw. 37, 38, 549 P.2d 470, 470 (1976) (per 
curiam), the LIRAB dismissed her appeal. It told Dean, “[t]he 
Hawaiʻi Supreme Court has declared that the time for filing a 
written notice of appeal is mandatory.” 
 Still self-represented, Dean appealed to the ICA.   She 
argued that the LIRAB had to exercise jurisdiction over her 
appeal. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
non receipt in mail and email caused one day delay in 
submitting appeal.  
The ICA affirmed the LIRAB’s decision. 
Per HRS § 386-
87(a), “the LIRAB was required to dismiss” Dean’s appeal. Like 
the LIRAB, the ICA relied on Kissell. A deadline’s a deadline. 
We conclude that the Department did not offer adequate 
evidence that it mailed its decision on March 9, 2022. The 
“Date of Decision/Date Mailed” line on the DCD cover sheet 
followed by a single written date is insufficient to establish 
the deadline for Dean’s appeal. We hold that the Department 
must clearly establish the date it “sent” a party a copy of a 
“decision of the director.” 
Therefore, Dean may appeal to the LIRAB.

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
III. 
HRS § 386-87(a) sets the deadline for a party to appeal a 
Director’s decision. A worker must appeal “within twenty days 
after” the decision is “sent” to them: 
A decision of the director shall be final and conclusive 
between the parties, except as provided in section 386- 89, 
unless within twenty days after a copy has been sent to 
each party, either party appeals therefrom to the appellate 
board by filing a written notice of appeal with the 
appellate board or the department. 
HRS § 386-87(a). 
The LIRAB received Dean’s written notice of appeal on March 
30, 2022. So the key date is on the front end. When did DCD 
send Dean the decision? 
That date – controlled by DCD – sets the appeal’s 
expiration date. Here, the record lacks clear proof of when DCD 
mailed its decision to Dean. 
The LIRAB reasons that a line on a cover sheet to the 
Director’s decision sufficiently shows two things: (1) DCD 
decided Dean’s case on March 9, 2022; and (2) DCD sent Dean the decision the same day. Here’s the line: 
The LIRAB assumes that the decision date and the mailing 
date are the same - March 9. We conclude that the compound “Date of Decision/Date Mailed” with a single written date does not justify that assumption. 
7  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
When an administrative appeals board decides that a mailing 
date renders an appeal untimely, “it [is] incumbent on [the 
original agency] to determine and prove the date of mailing.” 
Waikiki Marketplace Inv. Co. v. Chair of Zoning Bd. of Appeals 
of City & Cnty. of Honolulu
, 86 Hawaiʻi 343, 350, 949 P.2d 183, 
190 (App. 1997). The agency bears the burden of proof. It must 
show a decision was actually mailed, “i.e., deposited in a 
United States Post Office or post office box.” Id.Here, DCD 
must show, and the LIRAB must have sufficient basis to find, when the decision was sent. 
In 
Waikiki Marketplace, the Zoning Board of Appeals asked 
the ICA to presume that a decision was mailed on August 27 because it arrived by certified mail on August 28. Id.The ICA 
declined to do so. Id.The decision could have been mailed and 
delivered on the same day, and the agency failed to produce any 
evidence of the mailing date. Id. at 349-50, 949 P.2d at 189-
90. 
Here, DCD’s form preprinted two events (“Date of 
Decision/Date Mailed:”) followed by a roomy line. The person 
who processed the form listed only one date. The decision might 
have been made and mailed on the same day. But there is no 
direct evidence of mailing. 
The record does not clearly establish that the appeal 
window opened on March 9, 2022 and shut on March 29, 2022. 
8  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Thus, since any post-March 9 DCD mailing day would mean Dean’s 
March 30, 2022 appeal met the deadline, Dean’s case may 
continue. 
We hold that because DCD controls the start time to appeal 
its decision or order, and by extension the end time, it must 
establish the start date by clear, direct evidence. 
The policy rationales behind workers’ compensation and 
access to justice for do-it-yourself parties inform our application of a clear and direct evidentiary standard. 
This court honors HRS chapter 386’s “broad humanitarian 
purpose” to compensate employees injured on the job. Van Ness
v. State, Dep’t of Educ., 131 Hawaiʻ i 545, 558, 319 P.3d 464, 477 
(2014). 
We keep the law’s compensatory goal in mind. See
Alvarez v. Liberty House, Inc., 85 Hawaiʻ i 275, 278, 942 P.2d 
539, 542 (1997) (“To read HRS § 386–89 as not tolling the HRS 
§ 386–87 time limitation would be contrary to the goals of the 
workers’ compensation statute and would unjustly result in a 
technical forfeiture of the claimant’s right to appeal a DLIR’s 
decision to the LIRAB.”). 
This court also cuts self-represented litigants some slack 
to access justice. See Makila Land Co., LLC v. Kapu, 152 
Hawaiʻi 
112, 121, 522 P.3d 259, 268 (2022) (summarizing our approach to 
self-represented parties). Hawaiʻi law espouses access to 
justice principles. Waltrip v. TS Enters., Inc., 140 Hawaiʻ i 
9  
  
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
226, 239, 398 P.3d 815, 828 (2016). We construe self-
represented filings to pave a route to relief and an opportunity 
to be heard. Erum v. Llego, 147 Hawaiʻ i 368, 381, 465 P.3d 815, 
828 (2020). Our law prefers adjudication on the merits. JK v.
DK
, 153 Hawaiʻ i 268, 274, 533 P.3d 1215, 1221 (2023).   
To avoid messy disputes about when DCD sent a Director’s 
decision, we believe that a validated document, like a 
certificate of service or a postal service certificate of 
mailing, shows that the decision was sent to a worker on a 
specific date. See Waikiki Marketplace, 86 Hawaiʻ i at 349–50, 
949 P.2d at 189–90 (noting the absence in the record of “a 
postmarked envelope or certificate of mailing”). 
DCD could 
adopt a certificate of service from Form E-3 of the Rules of the 
Circuit Courts of the State of Hawaiʻ i (“The undersigned 
certifies . . . .”). 
These approaches are by no means the only way to go. These 
examples provide direct evidence of when a party’s appeal clock 
begins to tick. 
In contrast, the “Processed by” line and the 
composite “Date of Decision/Date Mailed” line with only one written date proves little. 
IV. 
We now address Kissell v. LIRAB. In denying Dean’s request 
to have her case heard on the merits, the LIRAB told Dean that 
10  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Kissell “has declared that the time for filing a written notice 
of appeal is mandatory.” See Kissell, 57 Haw. at 38, 549 P.2d 
at 470. That case prevented her appeal, the LIRAB explained. The ICA cited Kissell too. Because the LIRAB and ICA relied on 
Kissell, we discuss it. 
Kissell
 interpreted HRS § 386-87’s predecessor, then-
Revised Laws of Hawaiʻi § 97-96 (Supp. 1963).  
Id. at 37, 549 
P.2d at 470. Much like HRS § 386-87, that law said: “A decision of the director shall be final and conclusive between the 
parties, . . . unless within thirty days after a copy has been 
sent to each party, either party appeals therefrom by filing a 
written notice of appeal with the director or his county representative.” Id.Kissell concluded that the filing 
deadline was “mandatory.” Id. at 38, 549 P.2d at 470. So 
Kissell’s appeal, filed two months after the Director’s decision 
was sent, was untimely. Id.
All Kissell said in its two pages is that the plain 
language of a deadline statute applies. Kissell added nothing 
beyond the statute. It did not speak to the amount of evidence 
needed to establish when a decision was sent. Thus, it does not 
foreclose Dean’s appeal.
