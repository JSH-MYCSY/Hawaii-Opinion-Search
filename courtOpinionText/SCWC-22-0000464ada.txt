RECKTENWALD, C.J., McKENNA, EDDINS, GINOZA, AND DEVENS, JJ. 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY RECKTENWALD, C.J. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Erik Willis was convicted of attempted murder for the 
sudden, unprovoked stabbing of the complainant while she was 
sunbathing on a beach. 
The main issue at trial was whether 
Willis was the person who committed the stabbing. Willis   
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
appealed, arguing inter alia that the Deputy Prosecuting 
Attorney (DPA) committed prosecutorial misconduct by misstating 
evidence before the jury in closing. The Intermediate Court of 
Appeals (ICA) vacated Willis’s conviction and remanded the case 
for a new trial. The ICA agreed with Willis that the DPA’s 
statements constituted prosecutorial misconduct and, measuring 
the nature of the misconduct against the weight of the evidence, 
concluded that there was a reasonable possibility that the DPA’s statements contributed to Willis’s conviction. 
The State now asks this court to reverse the ICA and 
affirm Willis’s conviction. The State argues that the DPA’s 
arguments were based on reasonable inferences from the evidence 
presented. Even if the statements were improper, the State 
contends that they were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Put 
otherwise, the State argues that, taken in the context in which 
they were presented, there is no reasonable possibility that the 
DPA’s statements could have contributed to Willis’s conviction. 
We agree with the State that the DPA’s remarks in 
closing did not rise to the level of prosecutorial misconduct. The DPA’s challenged comments, viewed in context, were based 
upon reasonable inferences from the evidence adduced at trial. 
We further hold that there is no reasonable possibility that 
these comments from the DPA alone might have affected the 
trial’s outcome.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Accordingly, we vacate the ICA’s July 1, 2024 Judgment 
on Appeal and affirm the Circuit Court of the First Circuit’s 
(circuit court) July 20, 2022 Amended Judgment of Conviction and 
Sentence for Attempted Murder in the Second Degree. 
II. BACKGROUND 
A. Factual Background 
On July 8, 2020, 17-year-old M.K. was sunbathing alone 
on Kahala Beach when an unknown assailant pinned her down from behind, covered her mouth, and stabbed her in the neck repeatedly. She sustained life-threatening injuries as a result 
of the incident, but fortunately survived. 
In the days following the attack, the Honolulu Police 
Department (HPD) recovered surveillance video footage from a 
residence at 4671 Kahala Avenue. The footage, recorded from 
1:26 p.m. to 1:27 p.m. on July 8, 2020, depicted a person of 
interest with dark hair, a white t-shirt, tan pants, and black 
shoes with white markings walking on an access path towards 
Kahala Beach in proximity to where M.K. was attacked. M.K. would later identify the person depicted in the video as her 
assailant. 
In addition to the footage from 4671 Kahala Avenue, 
HPD also recovered footage appearing to depict the same person 
of interest arriving by city bus to the Kahala neighborhood 
shortly before M.K.’s attack on the afternoon of July 8, 2020.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
HPD identified the person in the bus footage as Defendant Erik 
Willis. 
On July 11, 2020, HPD conducted a warrantless arrest 
of Willis at his residence. Officers entered the residence 
without permission, detained Willis, and recovered physical 
evidence, including a pair of black shoes and a white t-shirt. 
On July 24, 2020, an O‘ ahu Grand Jury indicted Willis 
for the offense of attempted murder in the second degree under 
Hawai‘i Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 705-500 (2014), 707-701.5 
(Supp. 2018), and 706-656 (2014). 
B. Circuit Court Proceedings1 
1. Pretrial motions and prior appeal 
On November 16, 2020, Willis filed a motion to dismiss 
the indictment, a motion to suppress M.K.’s identification of 
Willis as her assailant, and a motion to suppress evidence and statements obtained pursuant to the warrantless entry and 
search. The circuit court denied the motion to dismiss the 
indictment and the motion to suppress identification, but 
granted the motion to suppress the evidence and statements 
obtained at the time of Willis’s arrest. The State appealed and 
this court affirmed the circuit court’s order suppressing 
evidence in State v. Willis (Willis I), 150 Hawai‘ i 235, 500 P.3d 
1 The Honorable Kevin A. Souza presided over the circuit court 
proceedings.

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
420 (2021), holding that “[b]ecause the police entered Willis’s 
home without exigent circumstances, permission, or a warrant, 
the circuit court correctly suppressed the evidence and 
precluded its use at trial.” Id. at 241, 500 P.3d at 426. We 
remanded the case for trial. Id.  
2.  Trial 
The physical evidence recovered from Willis’s 
residence having been suppressed, much of the State’s case 
against Willis at trial was based on circumstantial evidence in 
the form of witness testimony and surveillance video that tied 
Willis to the scene of the attack. Among the witnesses called 
by the State were: Corporal Matthew Motas, the HPD officer who 
initially identified Willis from the bus surveillance footage; 
Taylor Gray, who was on the beach near M.K. at the time of the incident; Edward Leal, a landscaper who was working on a 
property at 4635 Kahala Avenue near the site of the stabbing; 
and M.K. herself. For its part, the defense put on no evidence 
and called no witnesses. Willis himself did not testify. 
a. The State’s case against Willis 
The State called Corporal Motas, who had previously 
mentored Erik Willis for a period between September 2015 and January 2016. By coincidence, Corporal Motas had also assisted 
in the investigation of M.K.’s stabbing. Motas identified 
Willis in State’s Exhibit 2, surveillance footage taken from the 
5   
 
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
city bus on July 8, 2020. When asked how he was able to 
identify Willis in the videos, Motas answered, “[f]acial 
features, body structure, hair,” adding, “Defendant has a very 
prominent brow.” 
The DPA questioned Corporal Motas about each of the 
surveillance videos the State entered into evidence. In 
addition to the videos taken from the city bus, which showed 
Willis travelling from Niu Valley to Kahala and back, Corporal Motas also identified Willis in State’s Exhibits 1 and 10, two 
surveillance videos taken from a private residence at the 
intersection of Halemaumau Street and Haleola Street, which 
Motas recognized to be near Willis’s residence. When viewing 
those videos, recorded in the early afternoon on July 8, 2020, 
Corporal Motas described Willis as wearing “[a] white shirt, 
khaki pants, black shoes with white markings on the sides, and a 
blue medical mask.” In a third video submitted as State’s 
Exhibit 6, recorded from the same Niu Valley residence later that day at 4:35 p.m., Corporal Motas observed that Willis was 
wearing the same clothing but that Willis’s white shirt now 
appeared to have a large stain “across the whole front of it.” 
Corporal Motas also identified Willis in State’s 
Exhibit 5, surveillance video taken from 948 Pueo Street in 
Kahala, near where Willis boarded the city bus to return to Niu 
Valley. The 948 Pueo Street video, recorded on July 8, 2020 
6   
 
 
  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
from 3:56 p.m. to 4:00 p.m., showed a man who Motas identified 
as Willis stepping off the street to linger in a driveway for 
several minutes before moving on. When asked to describe 
Willis’s clothing in the Pueo Street video, Corporal Motas 
answered, “[k]haki pants, the black shoes with the white 
markings, and a dirty white shirt, blue medical mask.” 
The State also introduced surveillance video marked as 
State’s Exhibit 3, showing a person of interest walking down the beach access adjacent to 4671 Kahala Avenue, and another, 
State’s Exhibit 4, showing a shirtless man running across an 
empty lot to a construction sink next to 4635 Kahala Avenue, 
down the beach from where M.K. was attacked. Corporal Motas was 
not able to identify the individual depicted in either video. 
The State also called Taylor Gray. Gray testified 
that, sometime after 1:00 p.m. on the afternoon of July 8, 2020, 
she was laying on Kahala Beach when she noticed what she thought 
was a couple being intimate behind a bush to her left. At some point, a man popped up from behind the bush. Gray described him 
as “a hapa-looking man with fluffy, dark hair . . . wearing a 
blue disposable mask and a white [t]-shirt with what looked like 
something . . . on the center of his shirt.” Gray briefly 
looked down and when she looked again the man was running down 
the beach in the ‘ Ewa direction. As the man ran away, Gray noted 
that he was wearing “long pants.” 
7   
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Gray then testified that, after the man ran off, a 
girl got up from the area of the beach where the man had just 
been. The girl was M.K. M.K. then approached Gray for help. 
Gray testified that M.K. was “holding the side of her neck” as 
she approached, and “pointing down the beach to where the man 
ran.” Gray then ran in the opposite direction to get help from 
a group of women up the beach. She returned with one of the 
women who helped her tend to M.K. Gray then called 911. It was 1:47 p.m. 
On the second day of trial, the State called Edward 
Leal. Leal is a landscaper who, on July 8, 2020, was working at 
4635 Kahala Avenue, a beachfront residence just a few lots ‘ Ewa 
of where M.K. was attacked. Leal testified through an 
interpreter that, at some time between 1:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m., 
he saw a “white guy” with wavy hair wearing light-colored pants 
and no shirt run through the vacant lot next to 4635 Kahala 
Avenue. Leal saw the man stop to wash off at a construction 
sink before running off the lot. When asked what the man was 
washing at the sink, Leal answered, “He was washing his arms, here, and also wash his face a little.” Leal did not identify 
the man and at no point in his testimony did he mention seeing 
blood. 
The DPA then played the video from 4635 Kahala Avenue. 
The clip, recorded at 1:46 p.m. on July 8, 2020, showed a man 
8   
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
with dark hair, no shirt, tan pants, and dark shoes run onto the 
lot adjacent to 4635 Kahala Avenue from the direction of the 
beach. The man in the video runs to the sink, appears to wash 
himself off, and then runs off of the lot. Leal confirmed that 
the man in the video was the same person he had described in his 
testimony. 
The State later called M.K. to the stand, where she 
recounted the stabbing attack in detail. M.K. testified that she arrived at Kahala Beach via access 133C, which is adjacent 
to 4671 Kahala Avenue, sometime around 1:20 p.m. on July 8, 
2020. After she had picked a spot to lay out her pareo, M.K. 
noticed a man walking toward her on the beach. The man walked 
past her and sat down on the beach nearby, “about two car 
lengths away.” She described the man as having brown, poofy 
hair and wearing a white t-shirt, light-colored jeans, and a 
blue clinical mask. She also noted his eyes and “his bushy 
eyebrows.” 
Some five minutes after the man in the white t-shirt 
had walked past her, M.K. laid down on the beach on her stomach. Sometime after she laid down, she felt a hand cover her mouth 
and a weight on her back. Then, something sharp stabbing into 
her neck. Unable to speak or move her body, M.K. attempted to 
block the attack with her hands as she was stabbed repeatedly. 
M.K. estimated that she was stabbed fifteen times before the 
9   
 
 
  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
attack relented and she felt the weight lift off her back. M.K. 
further testified that, as soon as she was able to move, she 
turned to look in the ‘ Ewa direction and saw the man in the white 
shirt running away. She saw no one else on that stretch of the 
beach. 
M.K. confirmed that, in the days after her attack, she 
had identified the man depicted in the surveillance video taken 
from 4671 Kahala Avenue as her assailant. M.K. then identified 
Willis in the courtroom as her assailant.   On cross, M.K. 
confirmed that she had previously identified Willis at a pretrial hearing on January 28, 2021.  
b. Defense motions for judgment of acquittal 
At the conclusion of the State’s case in chief, the 
defense moved for judgment of acquittal, contending that “in this case there is reasonable doubt as a matter of law.” The 
circuit court denied the motion, finding that “a reasonable mind could indeed conclude defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable 
doubt.” Willis declined to testify and the defense rested its 
case without presenting any evidence. After the jury was 
dismissed, the defense renewed its motion for judgment of 
acquittal, which the circuit court denied. 
c. Closing arguments 
The DPA’s closing argument began with a summary 
description that focused on the brutality of the alleged crime. 
10   
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
 
   
 
   
  
 
 
   
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
He then began reviewing each of the State’s exhibits and 
recounting witness testimony to present the State’s narrative as 
to what occurred on July 8, 2020. The DPA used video evidence 
to argue that Willis took the bus from his home in Niu Valley to 
Kahala Beach, where he attacked M.K., cleaned up at the sink in 
the nearby vacant lot, and disappeared for roughly two hours 
before resurfacing in soiled clothing and taking the bus back 
home. 
The DPA made the following statements in the course of 
his argument: 
Taylor Gray said when she saw the man who was on 
[M.K.]’s back get up, she took a look at him, she saw him, 
saw part of him, but she noticed that there was something 
on his white shirt. She didn’ t explain what it was, but 
there was something on the white shirt. But up to this point, there’ s been nothing on the defendant’ s white shirt. 
So what could it be? Blood? There was plenty of blood. 
Sand? It’ s on a beach. We don’ t know. 
But if you’ re the defendant, what do you do if you 
have blood on your shirt? What do you do if you have blood 
on your hands? 
At this time, the DPA showed State’s Exhibit 4, the 
video footage of the person of interest washing their hands in 
the vacant lot next to 4635 Kahala Avenue. The DPA narrated to 
the jury as the footage played: 
Ladies and gentlemen, this is State’ s Exhibit 4. And 
the time is 1:46:22. First of all, before we go, notice 
defendant is here. No shirt because it’ s soiled. Pants, 
light colored pants. Shoes, looks like some sort of 
marking on the side of it. 
Okay. Please run it to 1:46:43 and then stop it. 
Okay. Stop. 
11   
 
 
    
 
 
  
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Notice something in his left hand. Looks white. 
Most likely it’ s his shirt. 
Go to [1:46:]45 please. 
You notice he’ s turning, leaving the sink, and he’ s 
got something behind his back curled up.  It’s white.  
State submits that’ s his shirt.  So we don’ t know whether 
he washed the shirt at the sink, but we know from Edward 
Leal that he washed his hands and his face because he had 
blood on them.   
(Emphases added.) 
No witness had identified the person depicted in 
State’s Exhibit 4 as the Defendant, Erik Willis. Further, 
Edward Leal had not testified to seeing blood on the man washing 
at the sink. 
Shortly thereafter, the DPA replayed State’s Exhibit 
6, the video showing Willis walking back toward his residence 
after returning to Niu Valley,  and argued the following: 
Now we’re going to show you the surveillance video 
again from 5605 Haleola Street at 4:35 p.m. 
Now, the defendant, as we previously stated, had 
gotten off the bus at around 4:26 p.m. 
So just play it. 
So watch carefully when the defendant walks by. 
Stop. 
Shirt is soiled. So what happened was that after the 
defe
ndant arrived to the beach with a clean white T- shirt, 
after he stabbed [M.K.], he got blood on it, possibly sand. 
Tried to wash it out, and disappeared for two hours. 
So what to do? The defendant is on the beach. He’s 
targeted [M.K.] He’s on an isolated portion of the beach. He stabs her repeatedly. Then he stops and he gets up and he looks and he sees that Taylor Gray is looking at him. 
So what does he do? He runs. He runs down the 
beach. He runs up the vacant lot. He has to clean up. You run away, you clean up, you hide and wait. So he ran 
12   
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
away, he cleaned up. Now he has to hide and wait. This is 
the two- hour gap that we’re talking about.  So two hours. 
(Emphasis added.) 
The DPA then concluded the State’s closing argument, 
stating: 
We’re not asking the jury to fill in blanks, ladies 
and gentlemen. You are permitted to use circumstantial evidence to draw reasonable inferences. All the evidence 
before you point to the defendant as the one who stabbed 
[M.K.] attempting to cause her death on the beach in Kahala 
on July 8, 2020.  
In his closing, defense counsel commented on the 
absence of direct evidence. No witness saw the attack take 
place. HPD’s grid search of the area turned up no suspect and 
no weapon was ever recovered. The State introduced no evidence of motive. Further, the lead detective on the case, Detective 
Lacuata, was not called to testify.  
Defense counsel directly addressed the DPA’s comments 
as to Edward Leal’s testimony: 
Then there’s Edward Leal. Edward Leal was a 
landscaper who was working at 4635 Kahala Avenue. He says 
he saw a hapa guy with curly hair up at that white sink in 
the vacant lot adjoining the property. Edward Leal did not 
identify the defendant in court as the individual he saw 
standing at the white sink. He did not. The prosecutor 
never asked him that.  
Don
’t you think, ladies and gentlemen, if Edward Leal 
could say the man at the white sink who the prosecution 
says was washing blood off his hands and his face and 
washing blood off his white T- shirt –  don’t you think if 
Edward Leal could say that guy was the defendant, the prosecutor would have asked him that?   Nothing.  Nothing 
from Edward Leal establishing that the guy at the white 
sink was the defendant.  
And ladies and gentlemen, ask yourself this.  Where 
is the white sink?  The white sink was sitting in a vacant 
lot.  The police could very easily have taken that sink and 
13   
 
 
   
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
had it analyzed for blood, for fingerprints, for any 
evidence to establish that Erik Willis was the man standing 
at the white sink washing blood off his hands and his face 
and washing the blood out of that white T- shirt. Did the 
State present to you a single piece of evidence in this courtroom about that white sink? They produced nothing. Nothing. 
Defense counsel similarly commented on the DPA’s 
argument that Willis’s shirt was stained with blood: 
And then [the DPA] argues to you, well, if you watch 
the video, when Erik Willis goes to the beach, his T- shirt 
is white, and when he comes back, the T- shirt is soiled.  
Did the State present any evidence to you in this 
courtroom that the stains on his shirt were blood stains as they have argued to you[?] 
 
Finally, defense counsel called the State’s timeline 
into question, emphasizing that Corporal Motas had been unable 
to identify Willis as the individual depicted in State’s 
Exhibits 3 and 4:  
So to continue, ladies and gentlemen,  the State 
offers you more surveillance video. State’s Exhibit 4, the 
video from 4635 Kahala Avenue; and State’s Exhibit 3, the 
surveillance video from 4671 Kahala Avenue, the beach 
access. And the State attempts to create this time line 
for you of what happened  on July 8th, 2020.  
The problem is, ladies and gentlemen, when Corporal 
Motas testified  at trial before you in this courtroom, he 
told you in no uncertain terms that he could not identify 
the individual in State’s Exhibit 4, the surveillance video 
from 4635 Kahala Avenue; and State’s Exhibit 3, the 
surveillance video from the beach  access at  4671 Kahala 
Avenue. He testified in no uncertain terms that he could 
not identify that person as the defendant, Erik Willis.  
d. The verdict 
The jury found Willis guilty as charged of attempted 
murder in the second degree.   Willis then filed a motion for new 
trial based on sufficiency of the evidence and prosecutorial 
14   
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
  
 
   
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
misconduct, which the circuit court denied. On July 20, 2022, 
the circuit court entered its Amended Judgment of Conviction and 
Sentence. Willis timely appealed. C. Appellate Proceedings 
1. ICA Proceedings 
On appeal to the ICA, Willis argued that the DPA 
“committed multiple, continuing, and egregious acts of 
misconduct throughout the course of the trial and especially 
during his closing arguments that violated Mr. Willis’s constitutional right to a fair trial.”  In its answering brief, 
the State rebuffed Willis’s arguments of misconduct and asked the ICA to affirm his conviction and sentence. 
  2
The ICA agreed with Willis that the DPA committed 
prosecutorial misconduct. Its analysis focused on two 
statements from the DPA’s closing argument. The ICA held 
2 Willis raised five points of error before the ICA: (1) the 
circuit court “erred in denying [Willis’s ] Motion to Dismiss the Indictment 
for lack of probable cause”; (2) the circuit court “erred in denying 
[Willis’s ] Motion to Suppress Identification of the Defendant”; (3) “[t] he 
prosecutor committed multiple, continuing, and egregious acts of misconduct throughout the course of the trial and especially during his closing arguments that violated [Willis’s ] constitutional right to a fair trial”; (4) 
the circuit court “erred in denying [Willis’s ] Motion for Judgment of 
Acquittal”; and (5) the circuit court “abused its discretion in denying 
[Willis’s ] Motion for New Trial based on sufficiency of the evidence and 
prosecutorial misconduct.” The ICA held that the circuit court did not err 
in denying Willis’s motion to dismiss the indictment, motion to suppress 
identification, and motion for judgment of acquittal. State v. Willis 
(Willis II
), 154 Hawai‘i 160, 163, 548 P.3d 714, 717 (A
pp. 2024). Willis did 
not file a certiorari application challenging these holdings and thus they 
are not addressed in this opinion. As to the denial of Willis’s motion for a 
new trial, the ICA held that “the Circuit Court erred in denying Willis’s motion for a new trial based on prosecutorial misconduct.” Id. at 173, 548 
P.3d at 727. 
15   
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
that the [DPA] committed prosecutorial misconduct during 
his closing argument, when he argued to the jury that 
Willis was depicted in a surveillance video after the 
attack leaving a work sink, and “ we know from [witness] 
Edward Leal [(Leal)] that [Willis] washed his hands and his face because he had blood on them.” The DPA’ s statement 
referred to evidence of blood that was not in the record 
and misrepresented the testimony of the identified witness. 
Another statement by the DPA minutes later – that “after he 
stabbed [M.K.], [Willis] got blood on [his t- shirt]” – also 
introduced new evidence of blood in closing argument and amounted to misconduct. Based on the serious nature of the 
DPA’s conduct, the lack of a curative instruction, and the 
heavy dependence of the conviction on M.K.’ s credibility, 
we conclude that the DPA’ s improper statements about blood 
on Willis and his shirt were not harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt, and his conviction must therefore be 
vacated. Relatedly, we hold that the Circuit Court erred 
in denying Willis’ s motion for a new trial based on 
prosecutorial misconduct in introducing this new blood 
evidence in closing argument. 
State v. Willis (Willis II), 154 Hawai‘ i 160, 163, 548 P.3d 714, 
717 (App. 2024) (footnotes omitted, brackets in original).  
Consistent with its holding, the ICA vacated the 
circuit court’s Amended Judgment of Conviction and Sentence and 
remanded the case for a new trial.  
2. Supreme Court Proceedings 
The State now asks this court to reverse the ICA’s 
opinion and judgment on appeal.  
The ICA vacated Willis’s conviction on the basis that 
the DPA misstated the evidence during closing arguments when he 
said Edward Leal had testified that Willis “washed his hands and 
his face because he had blood on them.” The State argues that 
the “ICA misconstrued the meaning of the deputy prosecutor’s 
words,” noting that “the written transcript of the closing 
16   
 
 
    
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
argument does not accurately represent the prosody of the deputy 
prosecutor’s words.” The State contends that the audio 
recording of the closing argument makes clear that the DPA was 
merely arguing that there was blood on Willis’s t-shirt, rather 
than stating that as a fact. 
The State also contends that “the context of the 
deputy prosecutor’s words make it clear” that the prosecutor was 
arguing that Willis had blood on his t-shirt based on reasonable inferences from the surveillance video footage and “the 
extremely close proximity of the person in the video washing his 
hands and face to where the stabbing had taken place moments 
before.” The State emphasizes that the DPA was merely drawing a 
reasonable inference based on the circumstantial evidence 
presented at trial. Further, the State argues, “it is 
implausible that the jury would have believed that Leal 
testified that Willis had blood on his face and hands simply 
because the deputy prosecutor had said it,” given that Leal did not so testify, and the jury’s ability to review the video 
footage and observe that they could not see blood on Willis or 
his t-shirt. 
Finally, the State argues that even if the DPA 
mischaracterized Leal’s testimony, it was harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt because the key evidence in the case was the 
17   
 
 
    
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
video surveillance footage, which clearly showed Willis near the 
scene of the crime. 
Willis asks this court to affirm the ICA’s judgment 
vacating his conviction. He argues that the ICA did not err in 
concluding that the DPA committed misconduct during his closing 
argument. Willis contends that “[w]hether the Deputy Prosecutor 
paused before the word ‘because’ or not does not make his 
statements in closing any less misleading, less improper, or less prejudicial.” Because no witness identified Willis as the 
individual at the sink, “any argument that it was Erik Willis at 
the white sink or that he was washing blood off his person or 
his clothing would be improper since it could not be reasonably 
inferred from the evidence.” 
Willis emphasizes that HPD did not seize or analyze 
the white sink at any point, nor was there any physical evidence 
that would have linked Willis, or any other individual, to the 
sink. Thus, he contends that the DPA should not have “rhetorically asked the jury to speculate about the identity of 
the person at the sink and the presence of blood,” and that such 
statements were prosecutorial misconduct that warranted a 
vacatur of Willis’s conviction. 
Finally, Willis stresses that the impact of the DPA’s 
improper comments was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 
He argues that the State’s evidence was not overwhelming because 
18   
 
 
    
 
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the State’s case was predicated entirely on M.K.’s 
identification of Willis as her assailant.3 
III. STANDARD OF REVIEW 
“Whenever a defendant alleges prosecutorial 
misconduct, this court must first decide: (1) whether the conduct was improper;” and “(2) if the conduct was improper, 
whether the misconduct was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.” 
State v. Udo, 145 Hawai‘ i 519, 534-35, 454 P.3d 460, 475-76 
(2019) (citing State v. Maluia, 107 Hawai‘ i 20, 25-26, 108 P.3d 
974, 979-80 (2005)). “Prosecutorial misconduct is not harmless 
beyond a reasonable doubt if ‘there is a reasonable possibility that the misconduct complained of might have contributed to the 
conviction.’” Id.
 at 535, 454 P.3d at 476 (quoting State v.
Wakisaka
, 102 Hawai‘ i 504, 513, 78 P.3d 317, 326 (2003)). 
Further, “[i]f defense counsel does not object at 
trial to prosecutorial misconduct, this court may nevertheless recognize such misconduct if plainly erroneous.” State v.
Austin, 143 Hawai‘ i 18, 28, 422 P.3d 18, 28 (2018) (quoting 
Wakisaka, 102 Hawai‘ i at 513, 78 P.3d at 326).  “Because 
prosecutorial misconduct impacts the fundamental right to a fair 
3 Willis further requests this court to address “additional issues 
of prosecutorial misconduct, sufficiency of the evidence, and suppression of 
the eyewitness identification.” These issues were not raised in any 
application for writ of certiorari, are in any event without merit and, 
therefore, are not discussed herein.

trial, there is no difference between the plain error and 
harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standards of review.” State
v. Hirata, 152 Hawai‘ i 27, 31, 520 P.3d 225, 229 (2022) (citing 
State v. Riveira, 149 Hawai‘ i
 427, 431 n.10, 494 P.3d 1160, 1164 
n.10 (2021)). 
IV. DISCUSSION 
This court has defined prosecutorial misconduct as “a 
legal term of art that refers to any improper action committed 
by a prosecutor, however harmless or unintentional.” Udo, 145 
Hawai‘i at 534, 454 P.3d at 475 (citing Maluia, 107 Hawai‘ i at 
25, 108 P.3d at 979). “The first factor of the prosecutorial 
misconduct analysis is determining whether the DPA’s conduct was 
improper.” Id.
 at 535, 454 P.3d at 476. This determination 
requires the court to consider “the nature of the challenged conduct in relation to our criminal justice system generally and the special role of the prosecutor specifically.” State v.
Underwood
, 142 Hawai‘ i 317, 325, 418 P.3d 658, 666 (2018) 
(citation omitted). Prosecuting attorneys have “a duty to seek 
justice, to play fair and square.” Hirata
, 152 Hawai‘ i at 33, 
520 P.3d at 231. And given the important role that prosecuting 
attorneys play in our criminal justice system, this court 
acknowledges that “a prosecutor’s ‘improper suggestions, 
insinuations, and especially assertions of personal knowledge 
20   
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
are apt to carry much weight against the accused when they 
should properly carry none.’” State v. Clark, 83 Hawai‘ i 289, 
304, 926 P.2d 194, 209 (1996) (quoting State v. Marsh, 68 Haw. 
659, 661, 728 P.2d 1301, 1302 (1986)). 
“Prosecutors are also forbidden from introducing new 
information or evidence in closing argument.” Hirata, 152 
Hawai‘i at 33, 520 P.3d at 231.  However, this restriction does 
not prohibit prosecuting attorneys from crafting arguments based 
on the evidence in the record. “[I]t is well-established that 
prosecutors are afforded wide latitude in closing to discuss the 
evidence, and may ‘state, discuss, and comment on the evidence 
as well as to draw all reasonable inferences from the 
evidence.’” Udo
, 145 Hawai‘ i at 536, 454 P.3d at 477 (quoting 
Clark, 83 Hawai‘ i at 304, 926 P.2d at 209). Of course, “this 
latitude is not without limit. ‘[T]he scope of [the 
prosecutor’s] argument must be consistent with the evidence and 
marked by the fairness that should categorize all of the 
prosecutor’s conduct.’” State v. Pasene
, 144 Hawai‘ i 339, 367, 
439 P.3d 864, 892 (2019) (quoting State v. Rogan, 91 Hawai‘ i 405, 
413, 984 P.2d 1231, 1239 (1999) (brackets in original)). A 
prosecutor’s comments must also be legitimate, that is, they 
must “draw reasonable inferences from the evidence.” State v.
Mainaaupo
, 117 Hawai‘ i 235, 253, 178 P.3d 1, 19 (2008).  An 
21   
 
 
  
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
inference is reasonable when “the evidence bears a logical and 
proximate connection to the point the prosecutor wishes to 
prove.” State v. Basham, 132 Hawai‘ i 97, 112, 319 P.3d 1105, 
1120 (2014) (quoting United States v. Waldemer, 50 F.3d 1379, 
1384 (7th Cir. 1995). 
In the present case, the DPA’s statements regarding 
the blood on Willis’s hands and shirt were based on reasonable 
inferences drawn from the significant circumstantial evidence 
put on at trial and, thus, did not amount to prosecutorial 
misconduct. 
The DPA began his closing argument with a statement to 
the jury regarding circumstantial evidence and its role in the State’s case against Willis: 
Circumstantial evidence, which is set forth in your 
jury instructions . . . permits a reasonable inference to 
be drawn as to the existence of another fact. . . . 
So there’s two types of evidence, direct and 
circumstantial. And as we have stated, there’s significant circumstantial evidence which points to the defendant. 
So let’s start looking at some of that. And we’re 
going to begin with a time line. 
The DPA then focused on the surveillance videos and 
related witness testimony to construct a timeline that put 
Willis near the scene of the stabbing at the time it occurred on 
July 8, 2020. Corporal Motas positively identified Willis in five separate surveillance videos entered into evidence at 
trial. These videos showed Willis (1) leaving Niu Valley; (2) 
22   
 
 
    
 
  
 
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
taking the bus to Kahala and exiting at a stop near 4671 Kahala 
Avenue at 1:25 p.m.; (3) walking into a driveway at 948 Pueo 
Street in Kahala at 3:56 p.m., roughly two hours after the 
stabbing occurred; (4) boarding the bus at 948 Pueo Street and 
traveling back to the bus stop at the intersection of 
Kalaniana‘ ole Highway and West Halemaumau Street in Niu Valley; 
and (5) walking toward his Niu Valley residence.4 
In each of the videos in which Corporal Motas 
identified Willis, Willis was wearing the same clothing: white 
t-shirt, blue clinical mask, light-colored pants, and black 
shoes. Willis’s clothing and physical appearance in this 
footage match that of the unidentified person of interest in the surveillance footage showing that person approaching the beach 
access at 4671 Kahala Avenue at 1:26 p.m., just one minute after 
Willis departed the bus across the street from that location. 
Willis’s clothing and physical appearance in the videos in which 
he was identified also match the descriptions of M.K.’s 
assailant given by M.K. and Taylor Gray. Given the proximity in 
space and time, as well as the matching physical descriptions of the defendant, the DPA drew a logical inference when he argued 
4 The defense conceded that the individual seen in surveillance 
video “riding the bus from Niu Valley to Kahala and then from Kahala back to 
Niu Valley,” and the individual “walking down the sidewalk in Niu Valley,” 
was Willis. 
23   
 
 
  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
that Willis was the individual depicted in the surveillance 
video taken from 4671 Kahala Avenue. 
The DPA then noted the testimony from M.K. and Gray, 
who both testified that, after stabbing M.K. on the beach, the 
attacker ran away in the ‘ Ewa direction toward 4635 Kahala 
Avenue. According to Gray, this occurred sometime shortly 
before 1:47 p.m., when Gray made the 911 call to report the 
attack on M.K. At 1:46 p.m., the surveillance footage from 4635 
Kahala Avenue shows a shirtless person matching Willis’s 
description run onto the adjacent vacant lot from the direction 
of the beach. That person then appears to wash themselves off 
at a white sink. Edward Leal, who was working that day at 4635 Kahala Avenue and is visible in the video, testified that he saw 
someone in the lot washing his arms and face in a white sink 
around that same time. 
Recounting Leal’s testimony together with the video 
evidence in closing, the DPA argued: 
Ladies and gentlemen, this is State’s Exhibit 4. And 
the time is 1:46:22. First of all, before we go, notice 
defendant is here. No shirt because it’s soiled. Pants, 
light colored pants. Shoes, looks like some sort of 
marking on the side of it.  
24  . . . .   
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
You notice he’s turning, leaving the sink, and he’s 
got something behind his back curled up. It’s white. 
State submits that’s his shirt. So we don’t know whether 
he washed the shirt at the sink, but we know from Edward 
Leal that he washed his hands and his face because he had blood on them.  
(Emphases added.) 
Again, no witness had identified Willis as the 
individual portrayed in State’s Exhibit 4.  However, given the 
sequence of events established by the evidence, and read in 
context of the entire closing, there was a logical basis for the 
DPA to infer that the person seen washing in the sink in the surveillance video, and the person Edward Leal saw, was Willis. 
As such, the DPA made a legitimate argument when he stated, “So 5
5   Defense counsel emphasized in closing that Corporal Motas was 
unable to identify Willis in the videos introduced as State’s Exhibits 3 and 
4. In doing so, the d efense also explained why it would be particularly 
difficult for anyone to make a positive identification from those videos:  
If anybody was familiar with the defendant’s appearance, it 
was Corporal Motas. And he told you in no uncertain terms 
that he could not identify the person in State’s Exhibit 3 
and State’s Exhibit 4 as Erik Willis. 
And to his credit, ladies and gentlemen, he was 
telling you the truth. Look at the videos. The video from 
4635 Kahala Avenue is taken from a camera on a pole that 
Sergeant Matsuo told you was 15 feet in the air pointed at 
Kahala Avenue, a significant distance from the white sink. 
Look at the video. You cannot make an identification of 
the person walking up to the  white sink from that video. 
The camera’s too far away.  
And you look at State’s Exhibit 3, the video from 
4671 Kahala Avenue beach access. The resolution on that 
video is terrible. And it lasts for ten seconds. Not even 
ten seconds. An individual walks in front of the camera. 
You can’t even see the individual’s face.  
 
So when Corporal Motas tells you, I can’t identify 
the person in that video, he’s right. Nobody can.  
25   
 
 
  
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
we don’t know whether he washed the shirt at the sink, but we 
know from Edward Leal that he washed his hands and his face[.]” 
The ICA interpreted the remainder of the DPA’s 
comment, “because he had blood on them,” as a literal statement 
of fact which “referred to evidence of blood on Willis that was 
not in the record and, indeed, misrepresented evidence that was 
in the record.” Willis II, 154 Hawai‘ i at 171, 548 P.3d at 725. 
However, when the DPA’s statement is properly read in context of 
the DPA’s entire closing argument and the trial record as a 
whole, it becomes clear that the DPA was making an argument 
based on a reasonable inference from the evidence. See State v.
Bruce, 141 Hawai‘ i 397, 407, 411 P.3d 300, 309 (2017) (holding 
that the prosecutor’s challenged comments considered in context 
were “properly viewed as a part of the State’s argument”); State v. Marsh, 68 Haw. 659, 661, 728 P.2d 1301, 1302 (1986) (weighing 
the prosecutor’s challenged comments in context of the entire 
trial record). 
The audio recording of the closing arguments provides 
further context for the DPA’s statement. As the State argues, 
the recording “clearly reflects a significant pause before the 
word ‘because.’” Review of the audio recording supports the 
State’s position that to those in the courtroom the DPA’s 
26   
 
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
statement was presented as “we know from Edward Leal that he 
washed his hands and his face . . . because he had blood on 
them.” While the DPA’s statement could have been more clearly 
worded, it was not likely to be interpreted in the courtroom as 
a misstatement of the evidence. Rather, the context clearly 
signaled that the DPA was arguing an inference regarding the 
presence of blood. The jury had heard Leal’s testimony and had 
seen the video evidence for themselves. Jurors have the common-sense ability to distinguish between an inartful choice of words 
and a blatant misrepresentation of the record. 
Furthermore, it was within the wide latitude afforded 
to prosecutors for the DPA to comment on the soiled condition of 
Willis’s shirt. Video evidence shows Willis with a clean white 
t-shirt earlier in the afternoon, from the time he left Niu 
Valley until he departed the city bus in Kahala. Later video 
shows Willis in a soiled t-shirt when he reappears in the hours 
after M.K.’s stabbing. Taylor Gray testified that the man she saw running from the beach had something on the center of his 
white shirt. At the time of closing, the jury had seen these 
videos, M.K. and Gray had recounted the circumstances of the 
stabbing, and M.K. had identified Willis as her attacker in the 
courtroom. In that context, the DPA was making a fair comment 
27   
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
on the evidence, and not presenting wholly new evidence, when he 
made the following statement: 
Shirt is soiled. So  what happened was that after the 
defendant arrived to the beach with a clean white T- shirt, 
after he stabbed [M.K.], he got blood on it, possibly sand. 
Tried to wash it out, and disappeared for two hours.  
So what to do? 
The defendant is on the beach. He’s 
targeted [M.K.] He’s on an isolated portion of the beach. 
He stabs her repeatedly. Then he stops and he gets up and he looks and he sees that Taylor Gray is looking at him. 
So what does he do? He runs. He runs down the 
beach. He runs up the vacant lot. He has to clean up. You run away, you clean up, you hide and wait. So he ran away, he cleaned up. Now he has to hide and wait. 
(Emphasis added.) 
This characterization of the DPA’s statements is 
further supported by Willis’s failure to immediately object at 
trial. Willis raised objections at several points throughout 
the closing argument, but did not object in response to either 
of the DPA’s statements that the ICA later identified as prosecutorial misconduct. Failure to object does not prohibit a 
defendant from raising prosecutorial misconduct as an issue on 
appeal, as Willis has here. It does, however, tend to suggest 
that those in the courtroom at the time of closing did not 
interpret the DPA’s statements as a mischaracterization of the 
evidence. Moreover, to the extent there had been any confusion 
as to the nature of the DPA’s statements, Willis’s response to 
28   
 
 
  
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the challenged statements in closing clarified the state of the 
evidence: 
Don’t you think, ladies and gentlemen, if Edward Leal 
could say the man at the white sink who the prosecution 
says was washing blood off his hands and his face and washing blood off his white T- shirt – don’t you think if 
Edward Leal could say that guy was the defendant, the prosecutor would have asked him that? Nothing. Nothing 
from Edward Leal establishing that the guy at the white sink was the defendant. 
And ladies and gentlemen, ask yourself this. Where 
is the white sink? The white sink was sitting in a vacant lot. The police could very easily have taken that sink and 
had it analyzed for blood, for fingerprints, for any 
evidence to establish that Erik Willis was the man standing at the white sink washing blood off his hands and his face 
and washing the blood out of that white T- shirt.  Did the 
State present to you a single piece of evidence in this courtroom about that white sink? They produced nothing. 
Nothing. 
Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the DPA’s 
challenged statements, which were based on reasonable inferences 
from the evidence, were not improper. Further, because the 
DPA’s actions were not improper, we need not determine whether 
any alleged misconduct was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.   6 
6 Although it is not necessary to our holding, we note that we 
would also depart from the ICA’s harmless error analysis, and, in particular, 
its characterization of the evidence here. The ICA determined that the 
evidence against Willis was “not overwhelming,” and that the State’s case 
“depended heavily on the credibility of M.K.” Respectfully, we disagree. 
M.K.’s identification of Willis, though undeniably important, was only 
one piece of the State’s case against Willis. The State also presented 
considerable video evidence and witness testimony that support Willis’s 
conviction.  Surveillance video placed Willis near the scene of the crime at 
the time in question. Taylor Gray and Edward Leal provided descriptions consistent with the surveillance video, M.K.’s testimony, and the State’s 
version of events. Thus, although the State lacked physical evidence against 
Willis, the circumstantial evidence was substantial and went beyond M.K.’s 
identification alone. 
29   
 
 
  
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Accordingly, we hold that the DPA did not commit prosecutorial 
misconduct.
