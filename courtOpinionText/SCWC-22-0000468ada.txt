OPINION OF THE COURT BY RECKTENWALD, C.J. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
This case involves a charge of Robbery in the Second 
Degree and a conviction of Attempted Robbery in the Second 
Degree. Wesley Mau (Complainant) was sitting on a bench in a 
Waikiki park when petitioner John Sing and Abraham Sionesini approached him. Sionesini said “I want your watch,” and tugged 
on Complainant’s watch. Complainant pulled his arm away. Then 
Sing said “So what? You gonna call the police?” and lightly 
punched Complainant across the face. Sing and Sionesini walked 
away from Complainant, and police apprehended both men later 
that night. 
Sing was indicted for Robbery in the Second Degree 
under Hawai‘ i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 708-841(1)(a) (2014).  At 
trial, the circuit court instructed the jury on both Robbery in the Second Degree and Attempted Robbery in the Second Degree, 
per the State’s request.
1 The jury did not convict Sing of 
Robbery in the Second Degree, but convicted him of Attempted 
Robbery in the Second Degree. 
Before this court, Sing argues that the circuit court 
erred in instructing the jury on Attempted Robbery in the Second 
Degree, and the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) erred in 
1 The Honorable James S. Kawashima presided. 
2  
 
 
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
affirming that decision. He contends that Attempted Robbery in 
the Second Degree is never a cognizable crime under HRS § 701-109 (2014) and HRS § 708-841 (2014). Alternatively, he claims 
there was insufficient evidence at trial to support his 
conviction of Attempted Robbery in the Second Degree. 
  We hold that Attempted Robbery in the Second Degree is 
a crime in Hawai‘i, but not under the facts presented in this 
case. Thus, the circuit court erred by instructing the jury on Attempted Robbery in the Second Degree. Accordingly, we 
(1) vacate the ICA’s judgment; (2) vacate the circuit court’s 
judgment, conviction, and sentence on Attempted Robbery in the 
Second Degree; and (3) remand to the circuit court with 
instructions to dismiss the charges against Sing with prejudice. 
II. BACKGROUND 
The facts of the case are straightforward. 
Complainant was waiting for his work shift in Waikiki when Sing and Sionesini approached him. 
Sionesini spoke to Complainant 
directly and said “Your watch. I want your watch,” while tugging 
on Complainant’s watchband. Complainant pulled his arm away, 
and Sionesini did not try to take the watch again. Sing then 
said to Complainant “So what? You gonna call the police?” and

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
“lightly” punched Complainant across the face.2 Sing and 
Sionesini then walked away. Complainant walked to a convenience 
store and asked a manager to call the police. Police arrested 
Sing and Sionesini later that night. 
Sing and Sionesini were charged with Robbery in the 
Second Degree,3 in violation of HRS § 708-841(1)(a).4 The Grand 
Jury charged: 
On or about November 18, 2019, in the City and County of 
Honolulu, State of Hawai‘ i, ABRAHAM SIONESINI and JOHN SING, 
while in the course of committing theft, did use force 
against the person of [Complainant], a person who was 
present, with the intent to overcome [Complainant’s] 
physical resistance or physical power of resistance, thereby committing the offense of Robbery in the Second 
Degree. . . . 
At trial, the State argued that Sing aided Sionesini 
as an accomplice and Sing should be convicted of Robbery in the 
Second Degree because he (1) attempted theft while (2) using 
force. The State requested jury instructions on Robbery in the 
2 Complainant described the punch as a one on a one- to-ten scale of 
pain. 
3 Sionesini pled no contest to the Robbery in the Second Degree 
charge. 
4 HRS § 708-841(1)(a) states: 
A person commits the offense of r obbery in the s econd degree if, 
in the course of committing theft or non- consensual taking of a 
motor vehicle: 
(a) The person uses force against the person of 
anyone present with the intent to overcome that 
person's physical resistance or physical power 
of resistance.

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Second Degree, Attempted Robbery in the Second Degree, and 
accomplice liability. 
The court gave both the accomplice and attempted 
robbery instructions over Sing’s objections. It first instructed the jury on the offense of Robbery in the Second 
Degree: 
The defendant, John Sing, is charged with the offense 
of Robbery in the Second D egree. 
 A person commits Robbery in the Second Degree  if, in 
the course of committing theft, the person uses force 
against the person of anyone present, with the intent to 
overcome the person’ s physical resistance or physical power 
of resistance.  
There are two material elements of Robbery in the 
Second Degree, each of which the prosecution must prove 
beyond a reasonable doubt. 
The two elements are: 
1.
 That, on or about November 18, 2019, in the City 
and County of Honolulu, State of Hawai‘ i, the defendant, 
John Sing, was in the course of committing theft; and 
2. That, while doing so, the defendant, John Sing, 
used force against the person of [Complainant], a person 
who was present, with intent to overcome [Complainant’s] 
physical resistance or physical power of resistance. 
 A person commits theft if he intentionally obtains or 
exerts unauthorized control over the property of another 
with intent to deprive the person of the property.  
An act shall be deemed “ in the course of committing 
theft”  if it occurs in an attempt to commit theft, in the 
commission of theft, or in the flight after the attempt or 
commission.  
(Emphasis added.) 
5  
 
 
   
 
   
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The Court then instructed the jury on Attempted 
Robbery in the Second Degree: 
 If and only if you find the defendant not guilty  of 
Robbery in the Second D egree, or you are unable to reach a 
unanimous verdict as to this offense, then you must 
consider whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty of 
the included offense of Attempted Robbery in the Second 
Degree.  
 A person commits the offense of Attempted Robbery in 
the Second D egree  if he intentionally engages in conduct 
which, under the circumstances as he believes them to be, constitutes a substantial step in the course of –  in a 
course of conduct intended to culminate in his commission 
of Robbery in the Second Degree.  
(Emphases added.) 
The jury found Sing guilty of Attempted Robbery 
in the Second Degree. It did not find Sing guilty of 
Robbery in the Second Degree. 
The verdict form read as follows: 
Sing appealed his conviction to the ICA, arguing 
(1) the circuit court erred by giving the Attempted Robbery 
in the Second Degree instruction and (2) there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction of 
Attempted Robbery in the Second Degree. 
6  
 
 
   
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
   
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The ICA affirmed his conviction. It concluded 
the circuit court did not err in giving the Attempted 
Robbery instruction because “[t]here was a rational basis 
in the evidence for the jury to find that Sing attempted to 
obtain or exert control over [Complainant’s] watch, and 
thus to convict Sing of the included offense of Attempted 
Robbery in the Second Degree.” It also concluded that 
there was sufficient evidence to support his conviction. 
Sing asks this court to reverse his conviction. He 
contends that the ICA erred by holding there was (1) a rational basis for the Attempted Robbery in the Second Degree jury 
instruction and (2) sufficient evidence to support his 
conviction for Attempted Robbery in the Second Degree. 
III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Statutory Interpretation 
  “The interpretation of a statute is a question of law 
reviewable de novo.” State v. Arceo, 84 Hawai‘i 1, 10, 928 P.2d 
843, 852 (1996). 
Furthermore, our statutory construction is guided by 
established rules: 
When construing a statute, our foremost obligation is to ascertain and give effect to the intention 
of the legislature, which is to be obtained 
primarily from the language contained in the statute 
itself. And we must read statutory language in the 
context of the entire statute and construe it in a 
manner consistent with its purpose. 
7  
 
 
  
 
  
 
       
 
 
 
 
     
  
  
   
 
    
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
When there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or 
indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an expression 
used in a statute, an ambiguity exists. 
In construing an ambiguous statute, “ the meaning of 
the ambiguous words may be sought by examining the 
context, with which the ambiguous words, phrases, and 
sentences may be compared, in order to ascertain 
their true meaning.” HRS § 1-15(1) (1993). 
Moreover, the courts may resort to extrinsic aids in 
determining legislative intent. One avenue is the use 
of legislative history as an interpretive tool. 
This court may also consider “ the reason and spirit of the 
law, and the cause which induced the legislature to enact 
it to discover its true meaning.” HRS § 1-15(2) [(1993)]. 
“Laws in pari materia, or upon the same subject matter, 
shall be construed with reference to each other. What is 
clear in one statute may be called upon in aid to explain 
what is doubtful in another.” HRS § 1- 16 (1993). 
Nonetheless, absent an absurd or unjust result, . . . this 
court is bound to give effect to the plain meaning of 
unambiguous statutory language and may only resort to the 
use of legislative history when interpreting an ambiguous statute. 
State v. Ruggiero , 114 Hawai‘i 227, 231-32, 160 P.3d 703, 707-08 
(2007) (brackets, citations, and ellipses in original omitted). 
B. Jury Instructions 
When jury instructions or the omission thereof are at 
issue on appeal, the standard of review is whether, when 
read and considered as a whole, the instructions given are 
prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, or 
misleading.  
 
Erroneous instructions are presumptively harmful and 
are a ground for reversal unless it affirmatively appears 
from the record as a whole that the error was not 
prejudicial.  
 
Error is not to be viewed in isolation and considered 
purely in the abstract.  It must be examined in the 
light of the entire proceedings and given the effect 
which the whole record shows it to be entitled.  In 
that context, the real question becomes whether there is a reasonable possibility that error may have 
contributed to conviction.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
If there is such a reasonable possibility in a 
criminal case, then the error is not harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt, and the judgment of conviction on which 
it may have been based must be set aside. 
State v. Gonsalves, 108 Hawai‘ i 289, 292-93, 119 P.3d 
597, 600-01 (2005) (internal quotation marks, citations, and 
brackets omitted) (quoting Arceo, 84 Hawai‘ i at 11-12, 928 P.2d 
at 853-54). 
C. Double Jeopardy 
The issue [of] whether a reprosecution is barred by 
double jeopardy is a question of constitutional law. We 
review questions of constitutional law by exercising our 
own independent constitutional judgment based on the facts 
of the case. Accordingly, we review questions of 
constitutional law de novo under the right/wrong standard. 
State v. Rogan , 91 Hawai‘i 405, 411-12, 984 P.2d 1231, 1237-38 
(1999) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). 
IV. DISCUSSION 
The parties dispute whether (1) attempted robbery is a 
crime at all under Hawai‘i law, and (2) it was proper to instruct 
the jury on Attempted Robbery in the Second Degree. We answer 
yes to the first question. We answer no to the second question. 
HRS § 708-841 (2014) defines Robbery in the second 
degree: 
(1) A person commits the offense of r obbery in the s econd 
degree if, in the course of committing theft or non-
consensual taking of a motor vehicle: 
(a) The person uses force against the person of 
anyone present with the intent to overcome that 
person's physical resistance or physical power of 
resistance; 
9  
 
 
   
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(b) The person threatens the imminent use of force 
against the person of anyone who is present with 
intent to compel acquiescence to the taking of or 
escaping with the property; or 
(c) The person recklessly inflicts  serious bodily 
injury upon another.  
(Emphases added.) 
  HRS § 708-842 (2014) defines the phrase “in the course 
of committing theft”: 
An act shall be deemed “in the course of committing a theft 
or non-consensual taking of a motor vehicle” if it occurs 
in an attempt to commit theft or non-consensual taking of a 
motor vehicle, in the commission of theft or non- consensual 
taking of a motor vehicle, or in the flight after the attempt or commission. 
(Emphasis added.) 
Because the phrase “in the course of committing a 
theft” includes both actual and attempted theft, we hold that 
Robbery in the Second Degree may be charged when a defendant allegedly (1) is “in the course of committing theft” (actually 
commits theft or attempts theft) and (2) actually uses force or 
threatens the use of force. Attempted Robbery in the Second 
Degree, on the other hand, may only be charged when a defendant 
allegedly (1) is “in the course of committing theft” (actually 
commits theft or attempts theft) and (2) attempts to use or 
threaten the use of force. The difference in the charge turns on whether there is an actual or attempted use of force (or 
threatened use of force). 
10  
 
 
   
 
 
  
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
We therefore conclude that Attempted Robbery in the 
Second Degree does not apply in cases where, as here, a 
defendant is in the “course of committing theft” and actually 
uses force. Those alleged actions are sufficient to convict on 
Robbery in the Second Degree, so there is no rational basis to 
instruct on Attempted Robbery in the Second Degree. In this 
case, we hold that there was no rational basis to instruct the 
jury on Attempted Robbery in the Second Degree, and accordingly, 
we vacate Sing’s conviction on that charge. 
A. Attempted Robbery is a Cognizable Crime Under HRS § 708-841 
When There is An Attempted Use or Threatened Use of Force 
Sing argues that the State can never charge a 
defendant with Attempted Robbery in the Second Degree under HRS 
§ 708-841, and therefore it was error to do so in his case. We 
disagree. Attempted Robbery in the Second Degree is a cognizable crime under HRS § 708-841, but as described infra 
section IV.B, not in Sing’s case. 
First, Robbery in the Second Degree statutorily 
includes both attempted and actual theft within the felony 
charge. Hawai‘i adopted a Model Penal Code (MPC) version of the 
offense of robbery. In doing so, the legislature deliberately 
included attempts of theft within a robbery charge because of 
the crime’s severity. See generally
 MODEL PENAL CODE AND 
COMMENTARIES § 222.1 (AM. L. INST., Official Draft and Revised 
11  
 
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Comments 1980) (“The perception that one who attempts a robbery 
poses essentially the same dangers as the successful robber led legislatures to develop more serious sanctions for various forms 
of attempt.”). The MPC explains that the phrase “in the course 
of committing a theft” is “defined to include conduct occurring 
during an attempt to commit a theft or in flight after its 
attempt or commission. This represents a broader conception of 
the offense than previously existed in many states.” MODEL 
PENAL CODE § 222.1 introductory note on section (AM. L. INST., Adopted Text 1962). 
  The commentary to HRS  § 708-841 indicates the Hawai‘ i 
legislature’s similar desire to create a more expansive 
understanding of robbery than was previously included:  
Basically, robbery appears to consist of both theft 
and threatened or actual assault.   It is significant to 
note, however, that the theft acts as an incentive to the 
threatened use of force.   Thus the combination of these two 
criminal activities has a multiplicative, rather than a simple additive effect.   This increased risk of harm is one 
reason why robbery is treated as a separate offense and 
more severely penalized than the sum of its simple 
components would seem to indicate.  
 Another reason which has 
been advanced for the separate treatment of robbery is that the average citizen feels a special degree of affront at 
the prospect of having his possessions taken through the threat or use of force.  
 
Previous Hawai͑i law also recognized two degrees of 
robbery.   Robbery was defined as the “stealing of a thing 
from the person of another or from his custody or presence, 
by force or putting him in fear.”  .  .  .  Thus, the Code's 
definitions of the offenses are substantively similar to 
those of prior Hawai͑i law; however, the Code's definitions 
are more inclusive than prior law  and are linguistically 
correlated with the theft offenses.  
12    . . . . 
 
 
   
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Commentary to HRS § 708-841 (emphases added). 
We have affirmed convictions of Attempted Robbery in 
the First and Second Degrees in the past, although those cases 
did not explicitly raise the issue posed here. See State v.
Vinge
, 81 Hawai‘i 309, 318–19, 916 P.2d 1210, 1219–20 (1996), 
abrogated on separate grounds by State v. Cabagbag
, 127 Hawai‘i 
302, 277 P.3d 1027 (2012) (“[A] defendant cannot commit first 
degree robbery without committing theft or attempted theft.”); 
State v. Mendonca
, 68 Haw. 280, 281, 711 P.2d 731, 732-33 
(1985) (affirming conviction of Attempted Robbery in the Second Degree when defendant drove after complainant’s car and fired 
several shots after he “decided to rob” complainant); State v. 
Reese, 61 Haw. 499, 499-500, 605 P.2d 935, 936 (1980) (affirming 
conviction of Attempted Robbery in the First Degree when 
defendant was “standing 75 feet away from [a] liquor store with a long-barreled rifle in his hands,” and told police he “was 
going to hit the store.”). 
We agree with the outcomes of these cases and hold 
that Attempted Robbery in the First or Second Degree is a 
cognizable crime in Hawai‘ i. Our statutory scheme permits an 
attempted robbery charge when there is an attempt of elements 
such as HRS § 708-841(1)(a) (when a defendant “uses force 
against the person”) and HRS § 708-841(1)(b) (when a 
13  
 
 
   For example, attempted robbery is an appropriate 
charge in circumstances where there was (1) attempted theft and 
(2) a substantial step taken toward using or threatening the 
imminent use of force. See State v. Farrad, 753 A.2d 648, 650, 
657 (N.J. 2000) (holding attempted robbery is cognizable where 
defendant wrapped his face in a scarf so that “only his eyes 
were visible” before entering a restaurant, walked towards the restaurant counter, “place[d] his hand into his right coat 
pocket” (and had a gun in that pocket), but was stopped by 
officers before anything else happened because MPC “suggests 
that attempted robbery is an appropriate charge when a defendant 
is apprehended before reaching the potential robbery victim.”). 
In Reese, the defendant was convicted of Robbery in the First 
Degree under HRS § 705-500 (2014) (the attempt statute) because 
he was “standing 75 feet away from [a] liquor store with a long-
barreled rifle in his hands,” and when approached by police said “I was going to hit the store.” 61 Haw. at 500, 605 P.2d at 
936. While the court there reversed on a different issue, our 
holding today would not have affected Reese’s prosecution for 
Attempted Robbery in the First Degree because the defendant took 
a substantial step towards using force or threatening the 
imminent use of force. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
defendant “threatens the imminent use of force against the 
person . . . .”). 
14  
 
 
   
 
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
We therefore conclude that Attempted Robbery in the 
Second Degree is a cognizable offense in situations where there 
are attempts to use force or threaten the use of force. 
B. Under the Facts of This Case, the Circuit Court Erred by 
Instructing the Jury on Attempted Robbery in the Second 
Degree 
  Here, Sing was charged with Robbery in the Second 
Degree under HRS § 708-841(1)(a) (when a defendant “uses force 
against the person of anyone present with the intent to overcome 
that person’s physical resistance or physical power of resistance.”). While attempted robbery can be charged if a 
defendant allegedly (1) attempts to use force against or 
(2) attempts to threaten the use of force against another, those 
facts are not before us. Sing did not attempt to use force. 
Instead, he actually used force when he punched Complainant 
across the face. Thus, there was no rational basis in the 
evidence to charge or find Sing guilty of Attempted Robbery in 
the Second Degree under HRS § 708-841(1)(a). 
The facts of this case are distinct from those of a 
case like Farrad or Reese. Here, Sing allegedly acted as an accomplice to Sionesini. He watched Sionesini approach 
Complainant, say “I want your watch,” and then tug on 
Complainant’s watch. Sionesini was appropriately charged with 
Robbery in the Second Degree, given that he (1) attempted theft 
of the watch and (2) used force by tugging on Complainant’s 
15  
 
 
   
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
wrist. Sing then allegedly furthered this attempted theft by 
saying “So what? You gonna call the cops?” and then lightly punching Complainant in the face. If Sing was acting to further 
the attempted theft, then he was (1) in the course of committing 
theft when he (2) used force against Complainant, by punching 
him in the face. Those facts would provide sufficient evidence 
to convict under Robbery in the Second Degree. 
HRS § 701-109(5) states that a court “is not obligated 
to charge the jury with respect to an included offense unless there is a rational basis in the evidence for a verdict 
acquitting the defendant of the offense charged and convicting 
the defendant of the included offense.” Here, there is no 
rational basis to convict Sing of the “included offense” of 
Attempted Robbery in the Second Degree, because Sing did not 
attempt to use force – rather, he actually used it. 
The State charged Sing with Robbery in the Second 
Degree under HRS § 708-841(1)(a) for allegedly using force 
against Complainant while in the course of committing theft. It had the burden to prove that Sing was “in the course of 
committing theft” and used force “with the intent to overcome 
that person’s physical resistance or physical power of 
resistance.” Sing used force by lightly punching Complainant 
across the face. Therefore, there was no attempt of that 
element. 
16  
 
 
   
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The only remaining element to apply the substantial 
step test to is “in the course of committing a theft.” By 
§ 708-842’s plain language, the phrase “in the course of 
committing a theft” includes attempted theft. See HRS § 708-842 
(“An act shall be deemed ‘in the course of committing a theft . . . ’ if it occurs in an attempt to commit theft . . . ”). 
Sing either attempted theft or he did not. He could not have 
attempted to attempt theft. Therefore, the circuit court erred 
in instructing the jury on Attempted Robbery in the Second Degree. 
The ICA therefore erred in determining there was a 
rational basis to instruct the jury on Attempted Robbery in the 
Second Degree because Sing “attempted to obtain or exert control 
over [Complainant’s] watch.” An attempt to obtain or exert 
control over an object is attempted theft. See HRS § 708-830(1) 
(2014) (defining theft as when person “obtains or exerts unauthorized control over the property of another with intent to 
deprive the other of the property.”). Attempted theft is already included in the definition of Robbery in the Second 
Degree. The ICA erred by concluding there was a rational basis 
in the evidence for the jury to convict Sing of the included 
offense of Attempted Robbery in the Second Degree under these 
facts. 
17  
 
 
   
 
   
  
  
  
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
In sum, we conclude that the circuit court erred in 
instructing the jury on Attempted Robbery in the Second Degree 
on the facts of this case. 
C. Disposition 1. The circuit court’s error was not harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt 
As discussed above, the circuit court erred by 
instructing the jury on Attempted Robbery in the Second Degree. 
The State argued “the inclusion of the attempted 
robbery instruction in the charge to the jury does not warrant 
the vacatur of [Sing’s] conviction” because Sing (1) “does not 
appear to declare that the alleged instructional error was 
prejudicial, nor could he genuinely so declare in light of his 
contentions,” and (2) did not “object to the wording of the 
instruction during the settling of jury instructions.” 
Because (1) instructional errors are presumptively 
harmful and grounds for reversal, unless, reading the record as a whole, they were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and 
(2) the errors here were not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, 
the State’s argument is unpersuasive. 
When jury instructions or the omission thereof are at 
issue on appeal, the standard of review is whether, when 
read and considered as a whole, the instructions given are 
prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, or 
misleading. Erroneous instructions are presumptively 
harmful and are a ground for reversal unless it 
affirmatively appears from the record as a whole that the 
error was not prejudicial. However, error is not to be

It must be examined in the light of the entire proceedings 
and given the effect which the whole record shows it to be 
entitled. In that context, the real question becomes 
whether there is a reasonable possibility that error might 
have contributed to conviction. If there is such a reasonable possibility in a criminal case, then the error 
is not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and the judgment 
of conviction on which it may have been based must be set 
aside. 
State v. Nichols, 111 Hawai‘ i 327, 334, 141 P.3d 974, 981 (2006) 
(emphasis added) (brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Gonsalves, 
108 Hawai‘ i at 292 -93, 119 P.3d at 600-01). 
  The improper jury instruction was not harmless beyond 
a reasonable doubt. That instruction read: 
If and only if you find the defendant not guilty of Robbery 
in the Second Degree, or you are unable to reach a 
unanimous verdict as to this offense, then you must consider whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty of 
the included offense of Attempted Robbery in the Second 
Degree. 
Here, the jury had the option to convict Sing of 
Robbery in the Second Degree, but did not do so. If the 
attempted robbery instruction had not been given at all, Sing 
might have been directly acquitted of the charge. Therefore, 
there is a “reasonable possibility that [the] error might have 
contributed to [his] conviction.” Nichols, 111 Hawai‘ i at 334, 
141 P.3d at 981. 
Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the error 
was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 
2. Sing may not be retried for Robbery in the Second 
Degree because double jeopardy protections apply 
Article I, section 10 of the Hawai‘ i Constitution 
requires that no person “shall . . . be subject for the same 
19  
 
 
 offense to be twice put in jeopardy . . . .” The Fifth 
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution requires that no person “shall . . . be subject for the same offence to be twice put in 
jeopardy of life or limb . . . .” 
  “Double jeopardy protects individuals against: (1) a 
second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal; (2) a 
second prosecution for the same offense after conviction; and 
(3) multiple punishments for the same offense.” Rogan, 91 
Hawai‘i at 416, 984 P.2d at 1242.

We have held that “a defendant may not be retried for 
any offense of which he has been acquitted, whether expressly or impliedly, notwithstanding a subsequent reversal of the judgment 
on appeal.” State v. Kalaola
, 124 Hawai‘i 43, 52–53, 237 P.3d 
1109, 1118–19 (2010) (quoting 
State v. Feliciano, 62 Haw. 637, 
644, 618 P.2d 306, 311 (1980)). 
Under HRS § 701-110(1) (2014) and relevant case law, 
[A] defendant who has been convicted of a lesser included 
offense than that charged is deemed to have been acquitted 
of the greater charge. Thus a defendant may not be retried 
for any offense of which he has been acquitted, whether 
expressly or impliedly, notwithstanding a subsequent 
reversal of the judgment on appeal. 
Feliciano, 62 Haw. at 644, 618 P.2d at 310–11. 
20   We presume “that jurors are reasonable and generally 
follow the instructions they are given.” State v. Holbron, 80 
Hawai‘i 27, 46, 904 P.2d 912, 931 (1995) (citation omitted).  
Here, the jury reached the erroneous jury instruction only  
 
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
because it could not agree as to whether Sing was guilty of 
Robbery in the Second Degree. See State v. Loa
, 83 Hawai‘i 335, 
359, 926 P.2d 1258, 1282 (1996) (“[T]he fact that the jury 
reached the erroneous instruction [of attempted manslaughter] at all signifies that it was unable to convict [defendant] of 
attempted first degree murder.”). In 
Loa, we vacated the 
defendant’s conviction for attempted reckless manslaughter because that charge did not legally exist. Id. at 339, 926 P.2d 
at 1262. The jury was erroneously instructed that attempted reckless manslaughter was an included offense of attempted 
first-degree murder. Id. at 359, 926 P.2d at 1282. We held 
that it was plain error to instruct the jury on a non-existent offense and that the defendant could not be tried again for attempted first-degree murder. Id. at 361, 926 P.2d at 1284. 
Similarly here, we hold that Sing’s conviction for 
Attempted Robbery in the Second Degree must be vacated because 
under the facts of this case, the offense did not exist, and 
therefore he may not be retried for Robbery in the Second 
Degree. The jury decided not to convict Sing of Robbery in the 
Second Degree, either because it found him not guilty of that offense or because it could not unanimously agree that he was 
guilty of that offense. This decision amounts to an implied 
acquittal, and Sing therefore may not be retried for Robbery in 
the Second Degree, as the State concedes.

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
In its supplemental briefing, the State argued that if 
we concluded the circuit court erred by instructing the jury on 
Attempted Robbery in the Second Degree, we would be applying a 
new rule that could lead to an influx of postconviction 
challenges from defendants previously convicted of Attempted 
Robbery in the Second Degree. It therefore contended that we 
should apply any new rule purely prospectively, so that Sing’s 
conviction would stand. Alternatively, the State urged us to 
adopt a pipeline retroactive effect, such that a new rule would only apply to those defendants who raise a challenge related to 
this issue on direct appeal. 
However, our decision today does not outline a new 
rule, but merely applies our precedents to the facts of this 
case. In Sing’s case, we are engaging in statutory construction 
“only . . . to elucidate the meaning and application of specific 
provisions of a statute.” See Rapozo v. State
, 150 Hawai‘i 66, 
80, 497 P.3d 81, 95 (2021). By holding that Sing could not have 
attempted to attempt theft in the circumstances of this case, 
this court is merely applying preexisting law. Thus, 
interpreting the Robbery in the Second Degree statute to include an attempt of theft does not constitute a new rule. We 
therefore need not decide whether our holding should apply 
retroactively or prospectively. 
See Schwartz v. State
, 136 
Hawai‘i 258, 274, 361 P.3d 1161, 1177 (2015) (“[W]here this court 
22  
 
 
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
engages only in statutory construction to elucidate the meaning 
and application of specific provisions of a statute, we have held that a new rule does not arise.”). 
Accordingly, we vacate Sing’s conviction and remand 
with instructions that the circuit court dismiss the charges 
against him with prejudice because double jeopardy principles 
bar a new trial on Robbery in the Second Degree. Because we 
vacate his conviction on this issue, we need not address Sing’s 
sufficiency of the evidence argument. 
V. CONCLUSION 
Based on the foregoing, we (1) vacate the ICA’s 
Judgment on Appeal, filed October 5, 2023; (2) vacate the ICA’s 
Summary Disposition Order, filed September 1, 2023; (3) vacate 
the Circuit Court of the First Circuit’s Judgment of Conviction 
and Probation Sentence, entered on July 5, 2022; and (4) remand 
the case to the circuit court with instructions to dismiss the 
charges with prejudice. Daniel Kawamoto    /s/ Mark E. Recktenwald
