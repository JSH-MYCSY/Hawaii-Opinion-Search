 Aquino as a principal or accomplice with unlawful imprisonment 
in the first degree, Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-
721(1)(a) (2014).   
 In a jury-waived trial, the Circuit Court of the Third 
Circuit convicted Aquino.   
 The Intermediate Court of Appeals vacated the conviction 
and remanded for a dismissal with prejudice.  Because the 
charging document omitted a definition of “restrain” relating to 
consent – an attendant circumstances element, in its view - the 
ICA ruled that the information was defective.  The ICA also held 
that the State failed to present sufficient evidence that Aquino 
restrained the minor and knowingly subjected him to the risk of serious bodily injury.   
 We hold that the information contained the elements of the 
charged offense and satisfactorily described the nature and 
cause of the accusation.  We also hold that the State presented 
sufficient evidence to convict Aquino.   
II. 
 In September 2021, the State charged Alexander Aquino (Aquino) by information with unlawful imprisonment in the first 
degree, HRS § 707-721(1)(a).  The charge reads: 
On or about the August 1, 2020 through August 21, 2021, in 
Kona, County and State of Hawaiʻ i, ALEXANDER AQUINO, as a 
principle [sic] or accomplice, knowingly restrained another 
person, L.R., a minor born in June of 2007, under 
circumstances which exposed L.R. to the risk of serious 
bodily injury, thereby committing the offense of Unlawful *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
3 
 Imprisonment in the First Degree, in violation of Section 
707-721(1)(a), Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes, as amended. 
 
In a separate information, the State charged Amy Aquino, 
L.R.’s biological mother and Aquino’s wife, with the same crime; 
also as a “principle [sic] or accomplice.”  Aquino is L.R.’s 
stepfather and L.R. calls him “dad.”  The cases were not 
consolidated.  Per a plea agreement, Amy Aquino pled no contest 
to unlawful imprisonment in the first degree.  
Before trial, Aquino moved to dismiss for “failure to 
charge offense.”  He argued that the information omitted an 
element of unlawful imprisonment in the first degree.  Since L.R. was under eighteen years old, Aquino believed the charging 
document needed to embed consent language from HRS § 707-700’s 
definition of “restrain.”  Aquino says the State should’ve told 
him that it had to prove the absence of “consent of the 
relative, parent, or institution having lawful custody” of the 
person. 
Circuit Court Judge Wendy DeWeese denied Aquino’s motion. 
Fourteen year old L.R. testified at the trial.  During the 
charged crime’s time frame, he lived with his mom and stepfather.  At night L.R. slept outside on an elevated back 
porch.  (The record uses porch and lanai interchangeably.)  
There were no stairs.  At 17 feet high, the porch stood nearly 
two stories off the ground.  The only way off it - aside from *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
4 
 going into the house, something L.R. wasn’t allowed to do 
without permission - was to climb over a railing and scale down 
the home’s poles.  If L.R. entered the house without asking, 
Aquino would yell at him and his mother.  Sometimes Aquino 
slapped L.R. to keep him in line.  Other times, Aquino hit him 
with a two-by-four. 
At night, L.R. recounted, Aquino and his mother would chain 
him up; it was Aquino’s idea.  They wrapped a 12-16 inch metal chain around his neck and locked it with a padlock.  The chain 
connected to a ring on the porch’s floor.  At first, Aquino or 
L.R’s mother leashed him.  Later, they made him self-restrain.  
So he often looped the chain around his neck and locked himself 
up.  When he was restrained, L.R. only had about 6 or 7 inches 
of movement.  He could not sit up.  L.R. slept on a towel on top 
of a plastic bag.  He was allowed a comforter blanket, but no 
pillow.  Aquino or L.R.’s mother kept the padlock’s key. 
Sleeping on the porch while chained started as early as 
2017, when L.R. was 10 years old.  L.R. told Aquino and his mother that he did not like being chained up.  He recalled how 
Aquino and his mother made sure he spent the nights locked up.  
Other than his birthday, when they allowed him to sleep in the 
house, L.R. slept outside with the chain around his neck. 
L.R. tried to run away in 2020.  But as he climbed down the 
porch, he slipped.  The fall fractured his back.  He said he *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
5 
 almost broke his neck.  L.R. couldn’t stand for a couple of days 
and experienced long-lasting back pain.  Yet, he received no 
medical treatment.  Neither his mother nor Aquino took him to a 
doctor.  Since L.R. was in so much pain, at first, the Aquinos 
didn’t chain him.  But about a month later, they resumed 
chaining L.R. by the neck on the porch.  
In August 2021, L.R. fled.  That night, L.R. put the chain 
around his neck, but he only pretended to close the lock.  While his mom slept and Aquino was at work, L.R. climbed over the 
lanai’s railing and down the poles.  He hitched a ride into 
Kailua-Kona town and came into contact with a woman who worked 
for Child & Family Service.  Upon hearing about his 
maltreatment, she called the Child & Family Service crisis line.  
Soon the police arrived and initiated an investigation.  Two 
days later, the Aquinos were arrested and charged. 
The State also called L.R.’s maternal grandmother.  Aquino 
had told her that “they” (meaning her daughter too) chained L.R. up when they left the house.  Neither wanted him to “escape.”  
The grandmother described her grandson’s gait.  He walked 
“crooked” and “hunched.”  And his normal movements were labored, 
such that he required many breaks on a simple ten minute walk. 
A county detective testified.  The detective discussed his 
interview with L.R.  L.R. was “visibly trembly,” and walked 
“hunched over” and “like an old man.”  L.R.’s gait was *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
6 
 “consistent with someone who has back issues or something like 
that,” and “both legs weren’t making the same motion.”  The 
detective said L.R. “was walking very, very obviously abnormal.”  
He authenticated a photo taken of L.R.’s discolored neck.  
The State also called a medical doctor.  Qualified as an 
expert, the doctor said that he had treated L.R. from August – 
December 2021.  The doctor testified that L.R. and his aunt came 
to his office for a wellness check.  L.R. appeared “very nervous” and told the doctor that he had back pain from falling 
off a balcony the year before.  After that, he had trouble 
walking long distances.  The doctor observed a “large bony bump” 
and a “softer bump” on L.R.’s back.  X-rays showed a 
“compression fracture of his third lumbar.”  The doctor said 
spinal injuries exceeded his area of expertise, so he referred 
L.R. to an orthopedic doctor. 
The defense did not present a case. Judge DeWeese found Aquino guilty of unlawful imprisonment 
in the first degree.  
The circuit court made extensive findings of fact and 
conclusions of law.  It found that L.R. credibly testified.  The 
chaining was Aquino’s idea and occurred for years.  The court 
pointed to L.R.’s testimony that “he was being chained up and 
padlocked at the time of his fall from the lanai in 2020 and 
that thereafter he was consistently being chained up by *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
7 
 Defendant and/or his mother.”  The court found that Aquino would 
decide whether or not to let L.R. into the house to use the 
bathroom, and that Aquino and L.R.’s mother controlled the 
padlock’s key.  The court concluded there was proof beyond a 
reasonable doubt that Aquino “as a principal, or accomplice, 
knowingly restrained L.R. between August 1, 2020 and August 21, 
2021.” 
Next, the court framed the case’s key trial issue: “[t]he 
main issue in the case is whether the chaining of L.R. exposed L.R. to the risk of serious bodily injury and whether Defendant 
knew this.”  The court spotlighted the failed escape when L.R. 
fell and broke his back.  Aquino “clearly knew” about the event 
and the resulting injury.  The court observed that it happened 
while he restrained L.R. daily.  Aquino knew L.R. might try to 
flee again and could be seriously injured if he continued to 
chain him.  Thus, the court concluded: “The credible evidence 
shows beyond a reasonable [doubt] Defendant knew that he was exposing L.R. to the risk of serious bodily injury when he 
continued to restrain L.R. on the lanai between August 1, 2020 
and August 21, 2021.” 
Aquino appealed. In a summary disposition order, the ICA sided with Aquino. 
The ICA ruled that the information overlooked an element.  
That element, the ICA said, requires the absence of consent.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
8 
 Per the ICA, an attendant circumstance element surfaces when the 
victim of restraint is under eighteen years old.  HRS § 707-700 
(2014) defines “restrain” and says that the restraint must be 
“without the consent of the relative, person, or institution 
having lawful custody of the person.”  Because “[t]his attendant 
circumstances element was not set forth in Aquino’s charge,” the 
ICA held that the information’s unlawful imprisonment in the 
first degree charge was defective. 
Regarding the State’s evidence, the ICA again agreed with 
Aquino.  “[T]he record does not contain sufficient evidence to support Aquino’s Unlawful Imprisonment conviction.”  The ICA 
believed that five findings of fact were unsupported and 
therefore clearly erroneous.  It did not find a causal link 
between the chaining and the risk of serious bodily injury.  
Because L.R.’s fall and back injury didn’t happen while L.R. was 
actually chained, there was no risk of serious bodily injury.  
The ICA pointed to the chain’s short length – it did not extend to the porch’s end.  “L.R. did not, indeed could not (because of 
the length of the chain and its location on the porch), have 
climbed down from the porch while chained.”  Therefore, “[t]he 
record evidence does not support a reasonable and rational 
inference that Aquino’s act of chaining L.R. was ‘under 
circumstances’ that ‘exposed’ L.R. to ‘the risk of serious 
bodily injury.’” *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
9 
  The ICA vacated the circuit court’s judgment of conviction 
and sentence.  It remanded the case to the third circuit for 
dismissal with prejudice. 
The State applied for cert, and we accepted. 
III. 
First, we examine the charging document challenge.  We hold 
that the information provided sufficient notice to Aquino.  It 
did not need to define “restrain” to allege that Aquino acted without the consent of L.R.’s lawful custodian (that is, Aquino 
himself or his separately-charged wife).  There was no attendant 
circumstances element here. 
Then we discuss the sufficiency of the evidence to convict 
Aquino of unlawful imprisonment in the first degree.  We hold 
that the evidence supports a finding that Aquino knowingly 
restrained L.R. by force or threat and knowingly exposed L.R. to 
the risk of serious bodily injury.   
  
The conviction stands. 
A. The charging document A charging document’s purpose is “to safeguard an accused’s 
fundamental right to know what they must defend against to avoid 
conviction.”  State v. Van Blyenburg, 152 Hawai
ʻi 66, 74, 520 
P.3d 264, 272 (2022).  A defendant has a constitutional right to present a complete defense.  State v. David, 149 Hawaiʻ i 469, 
481, 494 P.3d 1202, 1214 (2021).  To prepare and present a *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
10 
 defense, an accused must be informed of the “nature and cause” 
of the charge and each element.  See State v. Garcia, 152 Hawai
ʻi 
3, 6, 518 P.3d 1153, 1156 (2022).   
Article I, sections 5 and 14 of the Hawaiʻ i Constitution 
“inspire the criteria we use to measure the adequacy of a 
charge: charging documents must include the elements of an 
offense and sufficiently describe the nature and cause of the accusation.”  Id. 
The County of Hawaiʻ i charged Aquino as a principal or 
accomplice with unlawful imprisonment in the first degree: 
On or about the August 1, 2020 through August 21, 2021, in 
Kona, County and State of Hawaiʻ i, ALEXANDER AQUINO, as a 
principle [sic] or accomplice, knowingly restrained another 
person, L.R., a minor born in June of 2007, under 
circumstances which exposed L.R. to the risk of serious 
bodily injury, thereby committing the offense of Unlawful 
Imprisonment in the First Degree, in violation of Section 
707-721(1)(a), Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes, as amended.   
 
 Aquino maintains that he did not receive proper notice 
about the meaning of the restrain element.  Since he allegedly restrained a minor, Aquino says the information had to inform 
him about an absence of consent: “If the person is under the age 
of eighteen or incompetent, without the consent of the relative, 
person, or institution having lawful custody of the person.”  
HRS § 707-700.  Aquino insists those words create an element 
when a putative victim is not an adult.  Because the information 
omitted those words, Aquino’s argument goes, the State 
overlooked an element, and the charge gets dismissed.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
11 
  The ICA found Aquino’s position persuasive.  It concluded 
that an attendant circumstances element emerges when an 
offense’s conduct element includes “restrain” and the person 
restrained is a minor: 
If the subject of the restraint is under the age of 
eighteen (as was L.R. in this case), the statutory 
definition of “restrain” potentially adds an attendant circumstances element to the offense: “without the consent 
of the relative, person, or institution having lawful 
custody of the person.”  This attendant circumstances element was not set forth in Aquino’s charge.  Accordingly, 
the charge was insufficient, and should have been dismissed. 
 
(Footnotes omitted.) 
 We disagree. 
Unlawful imprisonment in the first degree is 
straightforward.  The crime occurs when a “person knowingly 
restrains another person under circumstances which expose the 
person to the risk of serious bodily injury.”  HRS § 707-721. 
Restrain is a conduct element of unlawful imprisonment in 
the first degree.  Kidnapping and unlawful imprisonment in the second degree, too.  HRS § 707-720 (2014); HRS § 707-722 (2014 & 
Supp. 2015); State v. Sheffield, 146 Hawai
ʻi 49, 57, 456 P.3d 
122, 130 (2020).  
HRS § 707-700 defines restrain two separate ways: 
“Restrain” means to restrict a person’s movement in such a 
manner as to interfere substantially with the person’s 
liberty: 
 (1) By means of force, threat, or deception; or 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
12 
 (2)  If the person is under the age of eighteen or 
incompetent, without the consent of the relative, person, 
or institution having lawful custody of the person. 
 
Here, the State’s information alleged the conduct element.  
It did not also need to define it.  Further, the statutory 
definition created no attendant circumstances element. 
 First, there are alternative ways for the State to prove 
restrain.  The “or” in HRS § 707-700’s definition of “restrain” 
is disjunctive, not exclusive.  See State v. Kalani, 108 Hawaiʻ i 
279, 284, 118 P.3d 1222, 1227 (2005).  Restrain means restricting a person’s movement “[b]y means of force, threat or 
deception; or” if the person is under the age of eighteen, 
“without the consent of the relative, person, or institution having lawful custody of the person.”  HRS § 707-700 (emphasis 
added).   
 Oftentimes there are alternative paths to prosecution. 
Indeed, the ICA recognized that the prosecution may charge a 
defendant under either HRS § 707-700 definition of restrain.  
“Where the subject of the alleged restraint is a minor or 
incompetent, the State can potentially charge the defendant 
pursuant to either or both definitions of restrain.”  
Per Aquino and the ICA, for those over 18 years old, 
restraint requires restriction “by means of force, threat, or deception.”
  In contrast, for those under 18, restraint must *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
13 
 occur “without the consent of the relative, person, or 
institution having lawful custody of the person.” 
We conclude that the consent definition of “restrain” is 
not automatically invoked when the person being restrained is a 
minor.  HRS § 707-700 does not create two unlawful imprisonment 
or two kidnapping offenses, one with a no consent attendant 
circumstances element, one without the added element.
  Rather, 
the second definition concerns a person who does not have 
“lawful custody” of a minor and who may or may not use force, 
threat, or deception to restrain the minor.  On the flip side, a 
person who acts with the permission of a parent is not guilty of 
unlawful imprisonment in the first degree unless the person uses 
force, threat, or deception to restrain the minor and exposes 
them to the risk of serious bodily injury.  See State v. 
Froland, 936 A.2d 947, 953 (N.J. 2007).   
If the accused uses force or threats, like here – and we 
suspect most prosecuted “restraint” cases – then the person gets 
charged under that theory.   
Other states with nearly identical statutes agree on the 
“parental consent” definition’s purpose.  It gives no legal 
cover to parents or lawful custodians who harm their children.  
No attendant circumstances element materializes when those 
adults restrain a minor by using force or threat and expose that 
child or teen to the risk of serious injury.  For instance, New *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
14 
 Hampshire Revised Statutes § 633:2 reads: “The meaning of 
‘confines another unlawfully’ . . . includes but is not limited 
to confinement accomplished by force, threat or deception or, in 
the case of a person who is under the age of 16 or incompetent, 
if it is accomplished without the consent of [their] parent or 
guardian.”  The New Hampshire Supreme Court concluded that “the 
statute does not provide parents with an unqualified lawful 
right either to confine their children or to consent that others 
confine them.”  State v. Bruce, 566 A.2d 1144, 1148 (N.H. 1989). 
Parents get no free pass to harm their children and expose 
them to the risk of serious bodily injury, because they have 
given themselves permission.  HRS § 707-700 does not afford 
parents (or their accomplices) immunity to unlawfully restrain 
their children.  The Arkansas Supreme Court found that parents 
chaining their child to a bedframe with a padlock constituted 
unlawful imprisonment.  See Dick v. State, 217 S.W.3d 778, 782 
(Ark. 2005) (“There is no merit to [defendant’s] argument on 
appeal that as a parent she could not be held liable for 
criminal conduct committed against [victim] because she had the 
lawful authority to consent to restraint of her child.”).  
States that have looked at similar provisions, such as the 
Revised Code of Washington § 9A.40.010 (which partially defines 
restraint as restricting a person’s movements without consent by 
“any means including acquiescence of the victim, if [they are] a *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
15 
 child less than sixteen years old or an incompetent person and 
if the parent, guardian, or other person or institution having 
lawful control or custody of [them] has not acquiesced”), have 
been clear – parents and other lawful custodians cannot consent 
to their own unlawful conduct.  See State v. Kinchen, 963 P.2d 
928, 929 (Wash. Ct. App. 1998) (“Parents can be guilty of unlawful imprisonment of their own children in circumstances 
where the restrictions on the children’s movements, viewed 
objectively, are excessive, immoderate, or unreasonable.”); 
Bruce, 566 A.2d at 1148 (affirming conviction for parent who 
unlawfully restrained child by tying them to a ceiling beam); 
Smith v. State, 703 S.E.2d 629 (Ga. 2010) (defendant was found 
guilty of unlawful imprisonment when she confined her son to a small room).   
 Here, in separate cases, the State charged both Aquino and 
L.R.’s mother with unlawful imprisonment in the first degree.  
If an age-related attendant circumstances element sprouted from HRS § 707-700, and L.R.’s mother consented to the restraint, 
then neither she nor Aquino could be lawfully convicted of 
unlawful imprisonment.  (An open factual question that is 
unnecessary to our holding is whether “stepfather” Aquino was “a 
person having lawful custody of [L.R.].”  If he was, he could 
not consent to his own unlawful imprisonment of L.R.)   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
16 
 We decline to read HRS § 707-700’s second definition of 
“restrain” as creating an attendant circumstance element that 
gives some adults immunity because they either consented to 
their own or to others’ unlawful acts.  Courts presume the 
legislature does not intend absurd outcomes, so courts interpret 
laws to avoid unsound, incongruous, or irrational results.  
State v. Haugen, 104 Hawaiʻ i 71, 76, 85 P.3d 178, 183 (2004) 
 We find State v. Johnson, 325 P.3d 135 (Wash. 2014) (en 
banc) sensible.  The Washington Supreme Court validated an 
information that omitted a statutory definition of “restrain” 
(one analogous to HRS § 707-700) for an “Unlawful Imprisonment—
Domestic Violence” charge.  Id. at 137-38.  The court reasoned 
that “the definition of ‘restrain’ defines and limits the scope 
of the essential elements . . . [t]hat does not make the 
definition itself an essential element.”  Id.  
 Likewise, HRS § 707-700’s definition of “restrain” defines and limits the scope of §§ 707-720, 707-721, and 707-222’s 
conduct element.  It is not itself an element.  We conclude that 
“restrain” alone provides sufficient notice to Aquino.   
Notice plays the central role in evaluating challenges to 
an indictment, information, and complaint.  Van Blyenburg, 152 
Hawaiʻi at 74, 52 0 P.3d at 272.  We repeat that charging 
documents are meant to provide notice, “not to facilitate obtuse technical arguments about what is and what is not an element of *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
17 
 a crime, or about what complex statutory definitions should or 
should not be included in a charging document.”  Id. 
 
We hold that Aquino received constitutionally-sound notice 
about the accusation.  He knew what he had to defend against.  
The County of Hawaiʻ i charged him as a principal or accomplice, 
tracked the language of unlawful imprisonment in the first 
degree, and identified the time frame, restrained person, and 
Hawaiʻi Penal Code provision.   
B. The Evidence 
The ICA held there was insufficient evidence to convict 
Aquino.  Because the ICA believed that several of the trial 
court’s findings of fact were clearly erroneous, it ruled that 
the trial court’s key conclusion - Aquino knowingly exposed L.R. 
to the risk of serious bodily injury - was unsupported. 
The ICA concluded “that FOFs 15, 16, 17, 26, and 27, and 
Aquino’s conviction for Unlawful Imprisonment, are not supported by sufficient evidence.”  The ICA vacated these FOFs: 
15.  The Defendant clearly knew of [L.R.’s] fall and that 
an injury had resulted.  And, while L.R. testified he does 
not know why he decided to climb off the porch and that it was a random impulse, the fact remains the escape attempt 
and fall resulting in injury occurred while L.R. was being 
chained up by both parents in the same manner as he was 
between August 1, 2020 and August 21, 2021. 
  16.  Also, L.R. testified that he repeatedly told both 
Defendant and his mother he did not like being chained up.  
Yet despite this Defendant and [mother] continued to chain 
up L.R., even after his fall in 2020.  
 17.  Thus, the evidence shows Defendant knew the risk of 
harm associated with continuing to chain up L.R. after the 
2020 escape and fall, namely that L.R. might attempt to *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
18 
 escape again by climbing off the lanai and hurt himself.  
 
. . . .  
 
26.  Further, the Court finds beyond a reasonable doubt 
that Defendant knew L.R. was exposed to the risk of another fall off of the lanai as had happened in 2020.  The 
circumstances that existed at the time of the 2020 fall 
continued to exist between August 1, 2020 and August 21, 
2021.  Defendant was still requiring L.R. to be chained. 
L.R. was still prohibited from being in the house without Defendant[’]s permission.  L.R. was still subjected to 
yelling and discipline by Defendant.  The only exit off the 
lanai still was only through the house, where L.R. was not 
allowed to be without Defendant[’]s permission.  L.R. had repeatedly told Defendant he did not like being chained up.  And, L.R. had in fact fallen off the lanai while trying to 
escape once before, resulting in serious bodily injury. 
 
27.  The credible evidence shows beyond a reasonable [sic] 
Defendant knew that he was exposing L.R. to the risk of serious bodily injury when he continued to restrain L.R. on 
the lanai between August 1, 2020 and August 21, 2021. 
 
 To reach its outcome, the ICA found the five FOFs clearly 
erroneous.  But it meaningfully discussed only one, FOF 15, 
concluding, “L.R. did not, indeed could not (because of the 
length of the chain and its location on the porch), have climbed 
down from the porch while chained.”  This (correct) 
understanding about the impossibility of escape while chained, 
prompted the ICA’s holding that “[t]he record evidence does not 
support a reasonable and rational inference that Aquino’s act of 
chaining L.R. was ‘under circumstances’ that ‘exposed’ L.R. to ‘the risk of serious bodily injury.’” 
 We conclude that the ICA misunderstood the courtroom events 
and the trial court’s ruling.  And it too narrowly approached 
the expose-to-risk-of-serious-bodily-injury element.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
19 
 First, the ICA appears to read FOF 15 to mean that the 
trial court thought L.R. was literally chained when he fell and 
broke his back.  But the trial court did not see the evidence 
that way.  The logical, contextual take on FOF 15 is not that 
Judge DeWeese misjudged the evidence, finding that L.R. fell 
while actually chained.  Rather, the court found that L.R. was 
chained during the time period that he tried to escape and fell.  
The court ruled that L.R.’s fall from the lanai “occurred while L.R. was being chained up by both parents in the same manner as 
he was between August 1, 2020 and August 21, 2021.” (Emphasis 
added.)  
 The record supports this view.  L.R. testified that he was 
“also being chained up” around the time he fell from the lanai.  
L.R. said his mom and Aquino briefly “let [him] up” after dinner 
and that this event preceded his failed escape attempt and 
injuries.  Clearly, L.R. was not chained at the moment he fell 
from the lanai.  As the ICA figured, that was impossible.  Instead, the Aquinos regularly chained L.R. during the back-
breaking fall’s time frame, even earlier that day.  FOF 15 is 
clear.  When L.R. fell, the Aquinos were chaining him up “in the 
same manner as” the August 2020 to August 2021 time frame 
alleged in the information.  The circuit court did not 
erroneously find that L.R. was chained when he fell.  Thus, the 
ICA’s key reason to upset the trial court’s fact-finding - “L.R. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
20 
 did not, indeed could not (because of the length of the chain 
and its location on the porch), have climbed down from the porch 
while chained” – was unsound. 
 FOF 13 adds context to the court’s finding and countermands 
the ICA’s belief about what the trial court meant by FOF 15.  
FOF 13 reads: “At the time of L.R.’s fall from the lanai in 
2020, L.R. had temporarily been let off the chain for dinner 
when he tried to climb off the lanai and fell.”  This finding shows that the circuit court understood the evidence that 
unfolded before it.  The court did not think L.R. was chained at 
the exact moment he fell from the lanai.   
Next, the ICA suggests that the 17-foot fall and the 
restraint were mutually exclusive.  That is, if L.R. was 
chained, then he couldn’t fall.  So there was no risk of serious 
bodily injury.  But this misses the overall context of the 
trial.   
L.R. testified that he was chained almost every night since 
2017, when he was 10 years old.  To instill obedience, L.R. recounted that Aquino would sometimes “whack” him with his hands 
or even with a two-by-four.  His mother and stepfather chained 
L.R. by the neck to a lanai 17 feet off the ground, about a two-
story drop.  Aquino forbid him from entering the house.  The 
only way to change his horrific plight was to risk serious 
bodily injury by climbing down the lanai.  And that’s what he *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
21 
 did one day.  But L.R. fractured his back.  “I almost broke my 
neck,” he said.  L.R. sustained lingering injuries that have 
caused him to walk “hunched over” “like an old man” and unable 
to walk for more than ten minutes without frequently stopping. 
The circuit court marched through the evidence and issued 
40 findings of fact.  The court found that L.R. credibly 
testified that the restraint was Aquino’s idea.  The court also 
credited L.R.’s testimony that Aquino and his mother continually chained him up at the time of his 2020 fall.  And it found that 
L.R. was only allowed into the house if his mom or Aquino said 
so.  Thus, L.R. had only one way off the elevated lanai to evade 
his confinement.  And that exposed L.R. to a risk of serious 
bodily injury.  The 2020 fall merely provided further, concrete 
evidence to support the reasonable inference that under the 
circumstances, L.R.’s restraint involved conduct that presented 
a very dangerous threat to his safety.  (We do not decide 
whether restraining a person with a chain over a prolonged time period itself exposes that person to a risk of serious bodily 
injury.) 
We stress that the method of restraint does not have to be 
the source of danger.  Most restraints are by definition 
restrictive.  We believe that restraining someone under 
circumstances where the only path to escape involves a dangerous 
endeavor may create a risk of serious bodily injury.  The *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
22 
 situation that produces the risk matters, not just the method of 
restraint.  The Wyoming Supreme Court rejected an argument “that 
the mechanism of the restraint 
must also be the risk.”  See 
Hurley v. State, 401 P.3d 827, 833 (Wyo. 2017).  It found that 
the source of restraint (locking someone in a motel room) does 
not need to be the same as the risk of serious bodily injury 
(the threat to beat someone up if they attempted escape).  Id.  
Similarly, the New Hampshire Supreme Court found that tying an 
elderly woman’s hands on a couch risked serious bodily injury 
because she could potentially attempt to get up and lose her 
balance.  State v. Burke, 33 A.3d 1194, 1197 (N.H. 2011). 
Likewise, if L.R. attempted to escape (again), he risked 
seriously injuring himself.  We believe it’s not only the 
restraint, it’s the circumstances surrounding the restraint, 
that demand scrutiny.  Here, it was improper to look at the 
restraint in isolation to determine the risk of serious bodily 
injury.   
What about Aquino’s state of mind?  The circuit court 
concluded that L.R.’s fall directly informed Aquino to the risk of danger.  L.R. fractured his back.  Indisputably, the court 
found that “L.R. suffered a serious bodily injury.”  Yet, Aquino 
soon started chaining him again anyway.  Neither he nor his wife 
took L.R. to a doctor.  Restraining L.R. in a place where his 
only potential escape was 17 feet off the ground exposed him to *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
23 
 the risk of serious bodily injury.  And Aquino knew it.  The 
record supports the circuit court’s conclusion that the 
“evidence shows beyond a reasonable [doubt Aquino] knew that he 
was exposing L.R. to the risk of serious bodily injury when he 
continued to restrain L.R. on the lanai between August 1, 2020, 
and August 21, 2021.”  
 The circuit court made well-reasoned findings of fact and 
conclusions of law.  The evidence supports the court’s finding that Aquino knew he was exposing L.R. to the risk of serious 
bodily injury when he continued to restrain L.R. with a chain on 
the lanai between August 1, 2020 and August 21, 2021.  The 
record supports all elements of unlawful imprisonment in the 
first degree. 
IV. 
We vacate the ICA’s judgment on appeal and affirm the 
judgment of conviction and sentence of the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit.
