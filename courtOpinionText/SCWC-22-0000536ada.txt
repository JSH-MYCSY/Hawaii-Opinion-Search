WAISER WALTER, 
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant.

OPINION OF THE COURT BY RECKTENWALD, C.J. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
This appeal arises from an incident in which 
Petitioner Waiser Walter stabbed his adoptive sister, Imaculata 
Roke, and his four-year-old nephew, J.R. Roke was taken to the hospital in critical condition and was eventually released. 
J.R. died as a result of his stab wounds. After entering guilty  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
pleas pursuant to a plea agreement, the Circuit Court of the 
First Circuit (circuit court) convicted Walter of murder in the 
second degree and attempted murder in the second degree. He was 
sentenced to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole. 
The Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) affirmed Walter’s conviction. 
Walter asks this court to vacate his conviction, 
arguing (1) the circuit court failed to engage him in a colloquy 
to ascertain the basis for his request for new court-appointed 
counsel, (2) the relationship between the circuit court and one 
of the State’s witnesses, his former deputy public defender, 
gave rise to an appearance of impropriety, (3) his public defenders provided ineffective assistance of counsel, and (4) 
the circuit court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his 
guilty plea. 
As set forth below, we hold that “fair and just 
reason[s]” warranted withdrawal of Walter’s guilty plea. The 
circumstances underlying Walter’s change of plea – particularly 
Walter’s consistent assertion that he lacked penal 
responsibility and the lack of a colloquy to determine the basis 
for his request for new counsel – weigh in favor of plea withdrawal. 
2  
 
 
 
 
    
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
However, we reject Walter’s suggestion that there was 
an apperance of impropriety raised by the circuit court’s 
relationship with one of the State’s witnesses. 
Accordingly, we (1) vacate the ICA’s June 21, 2024 
Judgment on Appeal, (2) vacate the circuit court’s August 10, 2022 Judgment of Conviction and Sentence, and (3) remand to the 
circuit court for further proceedings. 
II. BACKGROUND 
A. Circuit Court Proceedings 
Three days after the October 10, 2016 incident, on 
October 13, 2016, Walter was indicted on three counts: (1) attempted murder in the first degree, (2) murder in the second 
degree, and (3) attempted murder in the second degree. Deputy Public Defender Crystal K. Glendon (DPD Glendon) was appointed 
to represent Walter. From the outset of the case, Walter 
maintained he was guided by demons or God and pursued the 
affirmative defense of mental or physical disease, disorder or 
defect excluding criminal responsibility under Hawaiʻ i Revised 
Statutes (HRS) chapter 704 (2014).
1 Walter has remained in 
custody since October 14, 2016. 
1 Pursuant to HRS § 704- 400(1) (2014): 
A person is not responsible, under [the Hawaiʻi Penal]  Code, 
for conduct if at the time of the conduct as a result of 
physical or mental disease,  disorder, or defect the person 
lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
1. Medical examiners’ penal responsibility findings 
After Walter’s September 11, 2017 motion for a mental 
evaluation was granted on October 16, 2017, Walter was examined by a court-appointed panel of three medical examiners. The 
panel was generally favorable to Walter’s lack of penal responsibility defense. Two of the three examiners submitted 
mixed findings, but ultimately concluded that Walter lacked 
penal responsibility. The third examiner was unable to reach a 
conclusion. 
Initially mistaking the victim J.R.’s toxicology 
report for Walter’s, Dr. Alex Lichton, Ph.D. noted the presence 
of beta phenethylamine indicated Walter’s voluntary intoxication. In an addendum, however, Dr. Lichton corrected 
the factual error and concluded that Walter was not penally 
responsible because absent beta phenethylamine, Walter’s “use of 
alcohol, antihistamines and marijuana [was] not sufficient to 
account for Mr. Walter’s psychotic symptoms at the time of the 
alleged offenses.” 
After reviewing Walter’s toxicology report that found 
no amphetamine in Walter’s bloodstream, Dr. Martin Blinder, M.D. 
(continued . . .) 
wrongfulness of the person’s conduct or to conform the 
person’s conduct to the requirements of the law.  
4  
 
 
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
concluded Walter was suffering from an amphetamine induced 
psychosis from prior use when the incident occurred and thus 
lacked penal responsibility. The third medical examiner, Dr. 
John Compton, Ph.D., was unable to offer a definite conclusion 
as to Walter’s penal responsibility. 
After the court-appointed examiners submitted their 
reports, the State sought to retain two additional medical examiners, Dr. Sharon Tisza, M.D., and Dr. Leonard Jacobs, M.D., 
to assess Walter’s penal responsibility. At a July 24, 2018 
hearing, the State orally moved to allow Drs. Tisza and Jacobs 
to examine Walter and inspect the same materials the court-
appointed panel reviewed. The circuit court asked DPD Glendon if she had any objection, to which DPD Glendon stated a “record 
objection” to Dr. Tisza for “the delays it would cause” to the 
proceedings. 
With only a “record objection,” the circuit court
2 
granted the State’s motions and allowed Drs. Tisza and Jacobs to 
examine Walter and review pertinent records. Both examiners 
concluded Walter was penally responsible. Dr. Jacobs’s report 
noted that Walter was “intoxicated on alcohol, cannabis, and 
2 The Honorable Rom A. Trader presided over the case until December 
2018. The Honorable Catherine H. Remigio presided over this case beginning 
January 2019.

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
dextromethorphan [an active ingredient in cough syrup]” 
according to his Oʻ ahu Community Correctional Center (OCCC) 
records. Dr. Jacobs pointed to Walter’s admission that he “used 
Coricidin [an over-the-counter cough and cold syrup] with cough 
suppressant (dextromethorphan) not prescribed for him” and that 
he was “drunk” when the incident occurred. Dr. Tisza likewise 
concluded, “[b]ut for voluntary intoxication of multiple substances (Coricidin, Cannabis and Alcohol) on the day of the 
offenses Mr. Walter would have been able to appreciate the 
wrongfulness of his conduct (cognitive capacity) and to conform 
his conduct to the requirements of the law (volitional 
capacity).” 
2. Motion to withdraw as counsel Despite multiple continuances and defense counsel’s 
efforts to retain a sixth medical examiner, no additional medical examiner was hired. In early June 2019, Deputy Public Defender Earl Edward Aquino (DPD Aquino) was assigned Walter’s 
case after DPD Glendon left the Office of the Public Defender. 
Walter grew frustrated with his counsel and asked that DPD 
Aquino file a motion to withdraw. At the October 22, 2019 
hearing on the motion to withdraw, another deputy public 
defender appeared for DPD Aquino, who was not present. The 
6  
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
circuit court did not question Walter about why he requested his 
court-appointed counsel withdraw. Instead, the circuit court 
orally denied the DPD’s motion, stating Walter “does not have a 
right to an attorney he likes.” 
3. Change of plea 
On the same day the circuit court denied DPD Aquino’s 
motion to withdraw, the State offered a plea deal to Walter. 
The State offered to nolle prosequi count 1, attempted murder in 
the first degree, in exchange for Walter’s guilty plea on counts 
2 and 3, murder in the second degree and attempted murder in the 
second degree. 
The plea offer also required the defense and 
State to jointly recommend to the Hawaiʻi Paroling Authority that 
Walter serve a mandatory minimum of 35 years, but the State 
agreed that it would not seek extended or consecutive term 
sentencing. 
Walter later testified that he felt “hopeless” and 
“angry” he was stuck with an attorney that, from Walter’s point of view, gave him the option of either taking his chances at 
trial and likely losing or accepting a plea deal offered by the 
State for mandatory 35 years in prison before the possibility of 
parole. 
Walter decided to take the deal and change his plea.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
On February 3, 2020, the parties presented the plea 
agreement to the circuit court where Walter pleaded guilty to 
counts 2 and 3, murder in the second degree and attempted murder 
in the second degree. The circuit court asked Walter questions 
about his background, English language proficiency, reading and writing comprehension, his review of the plea agreement with DPD 
Aquino, his understanding of the penalties associated with each 
charged offense, his current state of mind, and the 
constitutional rights he was waiving by changing his plea. 
During the plea change colloquy, the circuit court and Walter 
had the following exchange: 
Q. [Circuit Court]: You know that once I sentence 
you, you cannot change your mind and ask for a trial, it 
will be too late by then; correct? 
A. [Walter]: Yes. 
Q. Now, we've gone over the plea agreement, do you 
have any questions about the plea agreement? 
A. Mm, no, Your Honor. 
Q. And you believe that you understand everything 
that's in the plea agreement? 
A. Yes, Your Honor. 
Q. Page 2 of the change of plea form, No. 7 says: I plead guilty because after discussing all of 
the evidence and receiving advice on the law from my lawyer, I believe that I am guilty. 
Is that a true statement? 
A. Yes, Your Honor. 
Q. And could you tell me why you believe you're 
guilty. 
A. 
Because I know that I did it. 
. . . . 
8  
 
  
 
 
   
 
   
    
 
  
 
    
 
   
    
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
  
 
 
   
     
 
   
   
 
    
   
 
    
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Q. But is anyone pressuring you or making promises 
or threatening you to get you to plead in this case? 
A. No, Your Honor. 
Q. Whose decision is it to plead in this case? 
A. Mine. 
Q. And are you comfortable with that decision, as 
comfortable as you could be given the gravity of the situation? 
A. Yes, Your Honor. 
Q. Have you weighed all of your options? 
A. Yes, Your Honor. 
Q. And do you believe that this is in your best 
interest? 
A. Yes, Your Honor. 
 . . . . 
Q. And did you and Mr. Aquino discuss strategy, 
such as what your defenses might have been if you wanted to fight these charges and go to trial? 
A. Yes, Your Honor. 
Q. And did Mr. Aquino give you some 
legal advice? 
A. Yes. 
Q. And, in fact, he secured this plea agreement 
for you? 
A. Yes, Your Honor. 
Q. Are you satisfied with the help he’s given to 
you? 
A. Yes, Your Honor. 
The circuit court found that Walter “voluntarily 
and intelligently entered his plea with a full 
understanding of the nature of the charges against him, as 
9  
 
 
   
   
   
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
well as the possible consequences.” Sentencing was 
scheduled for April 13, 2020 with instructions for the 
Adult Client Services Branch to conduct a pre-sentence 
investigation and report. 
4. Pre-sentencing motion to withdraw guilty plea 
Three days after changing his plea, Walter retained 
counsel Keith S. Shigetomi (new counsel). In the following months, the COVID-19 lockdown unfolded. Four months after 
entering the guilty plea, Walter’s new counsel indicated 
Walter’s intent to withdraw his guilty plea and sought to 
continue sentencing to retain a medical examiner to assess 
whether Walter knowingly entered his guilty plea. 
A week later, on June 25, 2020, Walter filed a motion 
to withdraw his guilty plea. Over the course of six months, the circuit court reviewed multiple memoranda in support and in 
opposition to Walter’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea and 
heard hours of testimony from Walter, his former counsel DPDs 
Glendon and Aquino, and a criminal defense expert.
3 
The motion asserted DPD Glendon and Aquino’s 
ineffective assistance of counsel was a “fair and just reason” 
3 The circuit court held six hearings on Walter’s motion to 
withdraw guilty plea. The hearings took place on July 15, 2020, July 30, 
2020, July 31, 2020, October 15, 2020, December 10, 2020, and September 15, 
2021. 
10  
 
   
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
for the guilty plea withdrawal because it “caused [Walter] to 
believe that he had no choice or alternative but to plea[d] 
guilty, thus rendering his guilty plea not intelligently, 
knowingly and voluntarily entered.” In particular, the motion 
highlighted (1) DPD Glendon’s failure to lodge more than a “record objection” to the State’s two additional medical 
examiners, and (2) DPDs Glendon and Aquino’s failure to retain a 
defense mental examiner demonstrated “a lack of skill, judgment 
or diligence” that caused Walter to lose confidence in his 
counsel. 
The circuit court denied the motion on January 26, 
2022. Applying the multi-factor framework outlined in State v.
Pedro
, 149 Hawaiʻi 256, 275, 488 P.3d 1235, 1254 (2021), the 
circuit court found no “fair and just reason” warranted pre
-
sentencing plea withdrawal. As to Walter’s assertion of 
innocence, the circuit court recounted its plea change colloquy and noted that when Walter pleaded guilty, he “understood that 
he was giving up his insanity defense [and] believed doing so by 
pleading guilty was in his best interest.” As to the second 
factor, the timing between Walter’s change of plea and 
withdrawal motion, the circuit court noted that for four months, 
11  
 
   
   
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Walter’s new counsel did not obtain a medical expert or further 
explain why it sought to continue sentencing. 
Considering the third factor, circumstances underlying 
the plea change, the circuit court emphasized that Walter had 
discussed his case with both DPDs Glendon and Aquino and received more than three years of legal representation before 
entering the change of plea. The circuit court also considered 
the “gravamen of [Walter]’s plea agreement,” and observed that 
the “most obvious consequence of a plea withdrawal is that 
[Walter] would face the possibility of life without parole if he 
were convicted of Count 1, or Counts 2 and/or 3 and sentenced to 
an extended term.” 
Fourth, turning to Walter’s background, the circuit 
court found Walter “had no problems reading and writing English[,]” “did not need an interpreter[,]” and “spoke to his 
attorneys in English and without an interpreter.” Fifth, the 
circuit court also found the State would suffer potential 
prejudice due to the passage of time since the incident (5 years 
at the time of the circuit court’s order), the retirement of 
eight police witnesses, and the relocation of the former medical 
examiner investigator to the mainland should Walter’s plea withdrawal be granted. 
In sum, the circuit court concluded Walter had not 
established a fair and just reason to withdraw his guilty pleas. 
12  
 
   
 
  
 
  
  
 
 
 
   
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
5. Motion to disqualify judge 
During the October 15, 2020 hearing on Walter’s plea 
withdrawal, the court disclosed that about six years prior, she asked one of the State’s witnesses - Walter’s former counsel, 
DPD Glendon – to organize a baby shower for a mutual friend. At the time, “[e]vent planning was a fun hobby” for DPD Glendon, 
who was given $100 by the circuit court judge to cover costs but 
was not otherwise paid for her services. DPD Glendon and the 
circuit court judge also both attended two birthday parties, one 
in 2012 and the other in 2017, but did not otherwise socialize 
with each other. 
Walter moved to disqualify the circuit court judge, 
arguing her prior relationship with DPD Glendon caused the court to favor the State and gave rise to an “appearance of 
impropriety.” The circuit court denied the motion to 
disqualify, explaining: 
[T]here was no financial gain. There was no 
socializing at that party. It was six years ago. And it 
was basically a favor to the mutual friend and to make sure 
that – that party was done correctly. 
And so when I look at the entire record, including 
the credibility of Ms. Glendon, and I look at the requirements that – that are left, which is the appearance 
of impropriety, I do not find that it fairly, the circumstances, fairly give rise to an appearance of impropriety or cast reasonable suspicion on my 
impartiality. And so the motion is denied. 
6. Conviction and sentence 
On August 10, 2022, pursuant to the February 3, 2020 
plea agreement, the circuit court found Walter guilty of murder 
13  
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
in the second degree and attempted murder in the second degree. 
Walter was sentenced to life with the possibility of parole with 
a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years. Pursuant to the plea 
agreement, the State and defense jointly agreed to recommend to 
the Hawaiʻ i Paroling Authority that Walter serve a minimum 
sentence of 35 years. 
The State did not seek extended or 
consecutive term sentencing. 
B. ICA Summary Disposition Order 
In his appeal to the ICA, Walter argued that the 
circuit court erred in denying (1) his motion to withdraw guilty 
plea, (2) DPD Aquino’s motion to withdraw, and (3) his motion to disqualify judge. The ICA disagreed and affirmed Walter’s 
conviction in a Summary Disposition Order. 
The ICA held that the circuit court did not abuse its 
discretion when it denied Walter’s pre-sentence motion to 
withdraw guilty plea. 
Applying the Pedro multi-factor 
framework, the ICA concluded that four of the five factors weighed against plea withdrawal. The ICA explained that the 
first factor, the defendant’s assertion of innocence, weighed 
against plea withdrawal because Walter “never denied committing the acts alleged in the indictment.” The ICA noted that the 
second factor, the time between the guilty plea and withdrawal 
motion, constituted an undue delay because during the four-month 
period between Walter’s guilty plea and plea withdrawal, 
14  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Walter’s new counsel failed to produce a medical examiner within 
the time frame given by the circuit court and instead filed a 
motion to withdraw Walter’s guilty plea. Third, weighing the 
circumstances underlying the plea, the ICA noted that Walter 
accepted the State’s plea offer after considerable deliberation with his counsel. Fourth, considering Walter’s background, the 
ICA concluded Walter’s English language proficiency weighed 
against withdrawing Walter’s guilty plea. Finally, the ICA 
concluded that there was no prejudice against the State – 
marking only one of the five Pedro factors in favor of Walter’s 
plea withdrawal. 
As to the denial of the motion to withdraw as counsel, 
the ICA agreed with the circuit court that Walter did not “have a right to an attorney that he likes,” but only a “right to an 
attorney that is capable and competent,” of which DPD Aquino was 
both. In response to Walter’s claim that the circuit court 
failed to engage in a meaningful colloquy when it heard the 
motion to withdraw, the ICA noted that engaging in a colloquy 
with a criminal defendant seeking new counsel “‘is not an end 
unto itself’ but ‘merely a means to an end . . . to protect the 
defendant’s right to effective representation of counsel[.]’” 
(Quoting State v. Kossman
, 101 Hawaiʻi 112, 119, 63 P.3d 420, 427 
(App. 2003)). It pointed out that although Walter “much later” 
argued his former counsel was ineffective, he told the circuit 
15  
 
 
 
  
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
court during his change of plea hearing that he was satisfied 
with the help he received from DPD Aquino. The ICA concluded 
that under these circumstances, there was no abuse of 
discretion. 
The ICA also held the circuit court did not abuse its 
discretion when it denied Walter’s motion to disqualify the circuit court judge. It concluded that a disclosed past 
relationship between the judge and State’s witness “would not 
cause ‘an objective, disinterested observer . . . [to] entertain 
significant doubt that justice would be done absent recusal[.]’” 
(Quoting Kondaur Cap. Corp. v. Matsuyoshi
, 150 Hawaiʻi 1, 11-12, 
496 P.3d 479, 489-90 (App. 2021)). Walter timely filed his 
application for writ of certiorari. 
III.
 STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Pre-Sentencing Plea Withdrawal 
We review a trial court’s denial of a Hawaiʻi Rules of 
Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 32(d) motion to withdraw a plea made 
prior to sentencing for abuse of discretion. State v. Garcia, 
135 Hawaiʻ i 361, 368, 351 P.3d 588, 595 (2015). 
[W]here the motion [to withdraw guilty plea] is presented 
to the trial court before the imposition of sentence, a 
more liberal approach is to be taken, and the motion should 
be granted if the defendant has presented a fair and just 
reason for his request and the State has not relied upon 
the guilty plea to its substantial prejudice. 
State v. Jim, 58 Haw. 574, 576, 574 P.2d 521, 522-23 (1978). 
16  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
B. Substitution of Counsel 
We review a lower court’s denial of a motion to 
substitute court-appointed counsel for abuse of discretion. 
Kossman, 101 Hawaiʻ i at 119, 63 P.3d at 427; see State v. Harter, 
134 Hawaiʻ i 308, 328, 340 P.3d 440, 460 (2014). “[T]he trial 
court’s decision will not be overturned on appeal unless ‘there 
was an abuse of discretion that prejudiced the defendant by 
amounting to an unconstitutional denial of the right to 
effective assistance of counsel.’” Kossman, 101 Hawaiʻ i at 119, 
63 P.3d at 427 (quoting State v. Torres, 54 Haw. 502, 505, 510 
P.2d 494, 496 (1973)) (emphasis omitted). 
C. Motion for Disqualification 
A lower court’s denial of a litigant’s motion to 
disqualify the judge is reviewed for abuse of discretion. 
Arquette v. State
, 128 Hawaiʻi 423, 447, 290 P.3d 493, 517 
(2012). “Decisions on recusal or disqualification present 
perhaps the ultimate test of judicial discretion and should thus 
lie undisturbed absent a showing of abuse of that discretion.” 
State v. Ross
, 89 Hawaiʻi 371, 375, 974 P.2d 11, 15 (1998).   
17  
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
IV. DISCUSSION 
A. Fair and Just Reasons Warranted Walter’s Pre-Sentencing 
Guilty Plea Withdrawal 
We first consider whether the circuit court erred when 
it denied Walter’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. We 
conclude it did. 
Criminal defendants do not have an absolute right to 
withdraw a guilty plea. Jim, 58 Haw. at 575, 574 P.2d at 522. 
“But where the motion [to withdraw guilty plea] is presented to the trial court before the imposition of sentence, a more liberal approach is to be taken, and the motion should be 
granted if the defendant has presented a fair and just reason 
for his request[.]” Id. at 576, 574 P.2d at 522-23. In Pedro
we introduced a multi-factor framework to guide courts’ analysis in determining whether “fair and just reason[s]” justify pre-
sentence plea withdrawal: 
Courts evaluating an HRPP Rule 32(d) motion to 
withdraw a knowing and voluntary plea before sentencing 
should consider: (1) whether the defendant has asserted and 
maintained innocence; (2) the timing of the request for the 
plea withdrawal and the reasons for any delay; (3) the 
circumstances underlying the plea; (4) the defendant’s nature and background; and (5) the potential prejudice to 
the prosecution caused by reliance on the plea. 
149 Hawaiʻi at 275, 488 P.3d at 1254. 
The multi-factor framework requires courts to 
“examine[] the totality of the circumstances to determine 
whether there was 
any fair and just reason justifying [the 
defendant]’s plea withdrawal.” Id. at 274, 488 P.3d at 1253 
18  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(emphasis in original). Pedro also clarified that State v.
Gomes, 79 Hawaiʻ i 32, 897 P.2d 959 (1995), merely outlined “one 
set of circumstances in which a trial court must grant a pre-
sentence motion for plea withdrawal,” imposing “a floor, not a 
curb, on trial courts’ discretion to grant a pre-sentence motion 
for plea withdrawal.” 
149 Hawaiʻ i at 272-73, 488 P.3d at 1251-52 
(emphasis in original). 
Applying Pedro
’s multi-factor framework to the 
circumstances here, we hold there were “fair and just reason[s]” 
for Walter to withdraw his guilty plea. Because Walter’s plea 
withdrawal is warranted under the “more flexible and permissive” fair and just reason standard, we do not reach Walter’s 
ineffective assistance of counsel claims. In light of our 
holding, we similarly do not reach Walter’s arguments related to 
DPD Aquino’s motion to withdraw as counsel. 
1. Walter maintained his lack of penal responsibility 
First, we assess “whether the defendant has asserted 
and maintained innocence[.]” Id. at 275, 488 P.3d at 1254. 
This factor is “context-dependent” and while “[c]ourts must look 
favorably on requests for plea withdrawal from defendants who 
have maintained their innocence and never admitted guilt, [] the 
converse is not true.” Id. at 276 n.22, 488 P.3d at 1255 n.22. 
Here, although Walter acknowledged he “did it” during the plea 
colloquy, Walter consistently maintained he was “guided by 
19  
 
     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
demons trying to save the world” prior to his guilty plea. 
Against the backdrop of Walter’s persistent assertion that he 
was not penally responsible, his acknowledgment during the plea 
colloquy that he “did it” does not, on its own, weigh against 
plea withdrawal. 
Criminal defendants’ fundamental right to assert lack 
of penal responsibility as a defense also weighs in favor of plea withdrawal in Walter’s case. After the change of plea 
hearing, but before the circuit court denied Walter’s plea 
withdrawal, we prospectively held in State v. Glenn
, “that if 
the trial court receives notice that the defendant’s penal responsibility is an issue in the case, the court must conduct a colloquy with a defendant to ensure that a waiver of the defense 
is intelligent, knowing, and voluntary.” 148 
Hawaiʻi 112, 129, 
468 P.3d 126, 143 (2020). Having notice that penal 
responsibility would be an issue, the circuit court here did not conduct any colloquy specific to Walter’s lack of penal 
responsibility defense, but rather broadly asked whether Walter 
discussed possible defenses with his counsel. Although Walter’s 
change of plea colloquy predates 
Glenn
’s prospective holding, 
our longstanding recognition that “lack of penal responsibility is a deeply rooted concept, not only in Anglo-American law, but 
also in 
Hawaiʻi[,]” further weighs in favor of plea withdrawal.  
See id.
 at 123, 468 P.3d at 137.

2. There was no undue delay under the circumstances 
Walter and the State dispute whether the four months 
between Walter’s plea change and withdrawal motion constitute an 
undue delay. The State argues four months was more than enough 
time for defense counsel to file a motion to withdraw guilty 
plea if Walter indeed had a “swift change of heart.” Walter, on 
the other hand, points to the COVID-19 pandemic and his new 
counsel’s stalled efforts to retain a medical examiner amidst 
the lockdown. 
We recognized in Pedro
 that “[t]he presence or absence 
of undue delay impacts a defendant’s entitlement to pre-sentence 
plea withdrawal.” 149 Hawaiʻi at 276, 488 P.3d at 1255. A 
“swift change of heart” is a “strong indication that the plea 
was entered in haste[,]” while an undue delay may not warrant 
withdrawal. See id.
 (quoting United States v. Barker, 514 F.2d 
208, 222 (D.C. Cir. 1975)). For example, the Pedro defendant sought to withdraw his change of plea after four months. Id. at 
264-65, 488 P.3d at 1243-44. We concluded there was no undue delay on the bases that the defendant was advised his plea 
change was “irreversible,” the trial court improperly speculated about the defendant’s motivations, and the defendant was unable 
to adequately explain to the court the reasons for any delay due 
to a lack of colloquy between the court and the defendant. Id.
at 276, 488 P.3d at 1255. 
21  
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Under the specific circumstances of this case, we 
similarly conclude four months was not an undue delay weighing 
against plea withdrawal. Walter entered his change of plea on 
February 3, 2020. Three days later, on February 6, 2020, new 
counsel appeared in his case. That same week, Walter refused to comply with the pre-sentence investigation under the advice of 
his new counsel. Although a plea withdrawal motion was not 
filed for four months, the swift appearance of new counsel, 
Walter’s immediate refusal to cooperate with a pre-sentence 
investigation, and the then-unfolding COVID-19 pandemic tip in 
favor of Walter’s guilty plea withdrawal. 
3. The underlying circumstances weigh in favor of plea 
withdrawal 
The lack of any meaningful colloquy between the 
circuit court and Walter during the hearing on DPD Aquino’s 
motion to withdraw further weighs in favor of plea withdrawal. In Harter
, we clarified the scope of a “penetrating and 
comprehensive examination” required when indigent defendants 
request appointed counsel be replaced. 134 Hawaiʻi at 323-31, 
340 P.3d at 455-63. We held that a trial court’s inquiry must 
be “the kind of inquiry that might ease the defendant’s 
dissatisfaction, distrust, or concern” as well as one that 
“enable[s] the court to determine if there is ‘good cause’ to 
warrant substitution of counsel.” Id.
 at 323, 340 P.3d at 455 
22  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(citations omitted). We also noted that typically, “good cause” 
to grant a motion to withdraw and substitute counsel “exists 
when there is a conflict of interest on the part of defense 
counsel, a complete breakdown in communication between the 
attorney and client, or an irreconcilable difference between the attorney and client.” Id. at 323-24, 340 P.3d at 455-56 
(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). 
DPD Aquino’s motion to withdraw simply stated that 
Walter “requested that [] counsel withdraw from his case and requested that the instant motion be filed.” At the hearing on 
the withdrawal motion, another deputy public defender appeared 
on behalf of DPD Aquino. There, the circuit court and substitute deputy public defender had the following exchange: 
THE COURT: Anything further, Ms. Lum? 
MS. LUM: Your Honor, I did speak with Mr. Walter in 
regards to whether or not he wants to proceed on this 
motion. The bottom line  is, you know, Mr. Aquino took over 
this case from another attorney. He hasn’t ma[de]  this 
decision frivolously. He cannot work with Mr. Aquino. He 
wants to have another attorney appointed to him. So we would leave it at that.  
THE COURT: 
I agree that – 
MS LUM: The Court may question him if it wants. 
Without further questioning the substitute deputy 
public defender or asking Walter about why he requested new 
counsel, the circuit court orally denied the motion, explaining: 
I agree [with the State] that the motion is 
insufficient. Simply not wanting to work with the attorney 
that’s assigned to you, who is actually from the same office as Ms. Glendon, who was his previous attorney, is 
23  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
insufficient. Mr. Walter does not have a right to an 
attorney that he likes. He has a right to an attorney that 
is capable and competent, and Mr. Aquino is both. So the motion is denied without prejudice. 
Under these circumstances, the circuit court could 
neither “ascertain the bases for [Walter]’s request,” nor 
ascertain whether a conflict of interest, breakdown in 
communication, or irreconcilable difference existed without 
asking Walter about the “status and quality of [his] attorney-client relationship.” See id. at 323, 329, 340 P.3d at 455, 461 
(quotation marks and citations omitted). Had the circuit court engaged in the required colloquy, it presumably would have 
learned Walter “didn’t have confidence” in his counsel because 
his public defenders never retained a medical expert. 
Walter felt “angry” that his counsel did not hire a 
medical examiner and that he was “stuck with this attorney who kept telling me that if we go to court we’re going to lose.” 
With no colloquy, Walter’s “dissatisfaction, distrust, or 
concern” was not put at ease. See id. at 323, 340 P.3d at 455 
(noting the colloquy “must be the kind of inquiry that might ease the defendant’s dissatisfaction, distrust, or concern”) 
(quotation marks and citations omitted). Instead, feeling like 
his only options were to go to trial and lose or “take[] a deal 
for 35 years,” Walter decided to take the deal. Under these 
circumstances, the lack of any Harter colloquy weighs in favor of plea withdrawal. 
24  
 
  
   
     
   
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
4. Walter’s background is the only factor that weighs against plea withdrawal 
A criminal defendant’s age, mental faculties, 
education, and English-language proficiency are pertinent 
considerations that may impact a defendant’s ability to 
“thoughtfully consider a plea’s implications.” Pedro
, 149 
Hawaiʻi at 280, 488 P.3d at 1259.  Walter was 29 years old when 
he changed his plea to guilty. Although English was not his 
first language, he moved to Oʻ ahu from Chuuk at 13 years old and 
attended school instructed in English through the 11th grade. 
The record contains numerous examples where Walter expressed a 
preference for communicating in English. Although a Chuukese 
interpreter was present at court proceedings early on in the 
case, Walter repeatedly told the court, his counsel, and medical 
examiners that he did not need an interpreter. This is the sole factor that weighs against Walter’s plea withdrawal. 
5. The withdrawal of Walter’s plea would not 
prejudice the prosecution 
Finally, in evaluating whether there is a “fair and 
just reason” for plea withdrawal, courts should also “weigh any 
prejudice to the prosecution caused by reliance on the 
defendant’s plea.” State v. Sanney
, 141 Hawaiʻi 14, 22, 404 P.3d 
280, 288 (2017) (quoting citation omitted). However, even when 
the prosecution is substantially prejudiced, other factors 
25  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
favoring withdrawal may outweigh prejudice against the State. 
Pedro
, 149 Hawaiʻi at 281, 488 P.3d at 1260. 
The State argues it is “potential[ly] prejudice[d]” 
because its case “has weakened given the retirement of eight 
police witnesses and the relocation of a former medical examiner 
investigator.” This argument is unavailing because it is 
speculative. “The mere fact that the passage of time might make it even more difficult for the prosecution to locate” a witness 
does not mean a plea withdrawal would substantially prejudice 
the State. Id. (quoting Gomes, 79 
Hawaiʻi at 40, 897 P.2d at 
967) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, the relevant 
period to evaluate prejudice against the State is the time 
between the guilty plea and motion to withdraw the guilty plea, 
not the time between the underlying incident and the plea 
withdrawal motion. It is unlikely that the now unavailable 
witnesses all retired or relocated in the four-month period 
between Walter’s guilty plea and motion to withdraw, thereby 
causing additional prejudice to the prosecution. Thus, the record does not show that any potential prejudice to the 
prosecution to locate and call out-of-state or retired witnesses 
is sufficient to weigh against plea withdrawal. 
With four of the five 
Pedro factors tipping in favor 
of plea withdrawal, we hold “fair and just reason[s]” call for 
the withdrawal of Walter’s guilty plea. In particular, Walter’s 
26  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
persistent assertion that he lacked penal responsibility and the 
lack of any Harter colloquy to ascertain the basis for Walter’s 
request for new counsel are compelling “fair and just reason[s]” 
that warrant plea withdrawal. 
In light of this holding, we need not determine 
whether the circuit court erred when it denied DPD Aquino’s motion to withdraw as counsel. We reiterate, however, that 
“when an indigent defendant requests that appointed counsel be 
replaced, the trial court has a duty to conduct a penetrating 
and comprehensive examination of the defendant on the record, in 
order to ascertain the bases for the defendant’s request.” 
Harter
, 134 Hawaiʻi at 323, 340 P.3d at 455 (internal quotation 
marks and citations omitted). Here, had a 
Harter colloquy taken 
place, the circuit court may have been made aware of the “fair 
and just reason[s]” that now warrant the withdrawal of Walter’s 
guilty plea. 
B. The Circuit Court Did Not Abuse its Discretion in Denying 
Walter’s Motion to Disqualify 
We now turn to whether the ICA erred in ruling the 
circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying Walter’s 
motion to disqualify the presiding circuit court judge due to 
her limited social relationship with the State’s witness, his 
former counsel, DPD Glendon. We conclude the ICA did not err. 
27  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Judges are disqualified when they “ha[ve] a personal 
bias or prejudice either against the party or in favor of any 
opposite party to the suit[.]” HRS § 601-7(b) (2016). Judges 
may also be disqualified if “circumstances . . . fairly give 
rise to an appearance of impropriety and . . . reasonably cast suspicion on [the judge’s] impartiality.” State v. Brown, 70 
Haw. 459, 467 n.3, 776 P.2d 1182, 1188 n.3 (1989) (emphases omitted)). “[T]he test for disqualification due to the 
‘appearance of impropriety’ is an objective one, based not on 
the beliefs of the petitioner or the judge, but on the 
assessment of a reasonable impartial onlooker apprised of all 
the facts.” Ross
, 89 Hawaiʻi at 380, 974 P.2d at 20. 
Walter contends that in planning a baby shower for a 
mutual friend more than six years prior to the instant 
proceedings, the relationship between the presiding judge and 
DPD Glendon is one where “[a]n impartial onlooker would have an impression of impropriety.” 
We disagree. Reviewing the record 
“through [an] objective lens,” it is unlikely “a reasonable person, knowing all the facts, [would] conclude that the trial 
judge’s impartiality could reasonably be questioned[.]” Ross
, 
89 Hawaiʻi at 380, 974 P.2d at 20 (quoting 
United States v. 
Lovaglia, 954 F.2d 811, 815 (2d Cir. 1992)). We therefore hold 
that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying 
the motion to disqualify.
