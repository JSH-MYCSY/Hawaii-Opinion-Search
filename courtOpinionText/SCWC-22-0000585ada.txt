 2 I. 
 
 In this procurement dispute, we examine Hawaiʻi Revised 
Statutes §§ 103D-302(b) (2012 & Supp. 2021) and 103D-709(d) 
(Supp. 2021), two Hawaiʻ i public procurement code laws.   
 A procuring agency, the Honolulu Board of Water Supply, 
(BWS) solicitated bids for a multi-million-dollar well-drilling 
project.  It disqualified a bidder.  Then it awarded the 
contract to the project’s only other bidder.  The ineligible 
bidder challenged the decision administratively and then 
judicially.  Because the bidder did not have the proper 
contractor’s license, and received no waiver, it lost each time.   Along the way, BWS maintained that the administrative 
hearings officer and the courts lacked jurisdiction to hear the 
procurement protest.  The challenge should’ve gone nowhere.  We 
agree.  
A bidder who protests a contract award is entitled to a 
hearing “provided that[] . . . [f]or contracts with an estimated 
value of $1,000,000 or more, the protest concerns a matter that 
is equal to no less than ten per cent of the estimated value of 
the contract.” 
 Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) § 103D-709(d)(2).  
The law’s plain words firmly limit who may initiate a procurement appeal.  In Hawaiʻ i’s public procurement code, there 
is no prudential consideration - a standing matter possibly 
waived - to secure review.  Rather, the law’s ten percent *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 3 requirement is jurisdictional.  Here, because the bidder could 
not satisfy the ten percent limit, no jurisdiction existed to 
initiate an administrative review hearing. 
II. 
 
In April 2022, the Board of Water Supply posted a 
solicitation for the construction of three exploratory wells on 
Oʻahu.  The work included a line item for tree trimming and 
removal.  
The solicitation scope of work described BWS’s many 
conditions for clearing on-site vegetation.  The solicitation 
specified that a C-27 license was required for tree trimming and 
removal, albeit obliquely.  It said, “[p]rior to removal or 
trimming of trees by a contractor with a valid C-27/C-27B 
license, a bird nest survey will be conducted by a biologist 
provided by the BWS.”  (Emphasis added.)  
The solicitation contained several environmental 
conditions, including supervision of tree removal by an arborist and bird biologist.  The solicitation asked contractors to 
minimize movement of plant material to mitigate the spread of 
invasive plant species.  It also required that the contractor 
“protect from injury and damage all surrounding trees, plants, 
etc., and shall leave all in as good as condition as at 
present.”  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 4 In May 2022, Alpha, Inc. bid $5.97 million for the work.  
It bested the only other bidder, Beylik/Energetic A JV (Beylik), 
by about $7,000.  Alpha’s bid included $95,000 for tree trimming 
and removal.  
Problems for Alpha surfaced.  Alpha had a C-17 excavating 
license, but not a C-27 landscaping license.  Also, Alpha did 
not name a landscaping subcontractor in its bid.  On May 13, 
2022, BWS announced it had awarded the contract to Beylik. 
On May 17, 2022, BWS sent Alpha a bid rejection letter.  
BWS’s reasoning was faulty.  The letter incorrectly stated that bidders did not have to list subcontractors with less than one 
percent of the work.  It also said the tree trimming and removal 
– worth $95,000 – totaled more than one percent of the bid, and 
so did not qualify for this purported exception.  Thus, Alpha’s 
bid was nonresponsive.  
The following day, Alpha sent a bid protest letter to BWS.  
Alpha argued both that its bid was responsive and that Beylik’s bid was nonresponsive because Beylik forgot to include a form.  
In this letter, Alpha 
indicated that it would do the tree 
removal itself and use a subcontractor for the tree trimming.  The sub’s trimming portion was $6,800, far less than one percent 
of the bid amount. 
That same day, a BWS employee emailed the Contractors 
License Board (CLB), asking whether a C-17 licensee may remove *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 5 trees.  A CLB official replied that in one Board member’s non-
binding opinion, a C-17 licensee may generally perform tree 
removal.  
On June 7, 2022, BWS rejected Alpha’s protest.  BWS pointed 
to HRS § 103D-302(b).  That law says construction bids must list 
all subcontractors, but that the government entity may waive 
this requirement if it’s in the public’s best interest and the 
missing sub had less than one percent of the work.  Because it didn’t list its subcontractor, Alpha flunked this requirement, 
BWS ruled.  Next, BWS reasoned that waiving the condition was 
not in the public’s best interest - Alpha’s bid was just 0.13 
percent lower than Beylik’s.  
BWS also rejected Alpha’s position that its C-17 license 
entitled it to remove trees.  For the well project, BWS cited a 
determination by the CLB that a C-27 contractor was needed to 
destroy tree roots without disturbing the surrounding soil in 
vegetated areas.  The solicitation expressly asked for a C-27 licensee to remove trees.  Alpha had no C-27 license.  Thus, 
Alpha could not remove trees on its well project, BWS decided. 
For these two reasons, BWS disqualified Alpha’s proposal. BWS also rejected Alpha’s challenge to Beylik’s bid.  It 
said Alpha lacked standing to attack Beylik’s bid, because Alpha was out, disqualified.  On the substance, BWS ruled that 
Beylik’s missing form was immaterial.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 6 In June 2022, per HRS § 103D-709(d), Alpha requested an 
administrative hearing review of BWS’s decision.  Alpha repeated 
the arguments it made to BWS.  
BWS moved to dismiss.  BWS made the ten percent 
jurisdictional argument it raises before this court.  
In July 2022, the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) 
issued its decision.  OAH concluded that the ten percent 
requirement is not jurisdictional and that it had jurisdiction to hear Alpha’s appeal.  
On the merits, OAH noted that HRS § 103D-302(b) requires 
construction bidders to list subcontractors (and that BWS’s 
rejection letter got this wrong).  OAH also explained that this 
solicitation demanded a C-27 contractor for the tree removal 
because of the project’s specific ecological needs. 
The hearings officer concluded that Alpha could perform 
some, but not all, of the project’s tree-related work.  The 
officer also found that Alpha did not request a waiver of the <1 percent subcontractor listing requirement and BWS, in its 
discretion, did not grant a waiver.  Thus, Alpha’s bid was 
nonresponsive.  
Alpha appealed to the circuit court.  The parties briefed 
the issues, and the court held a hearing.  
In September 2022, Circuit Court of the First Circuit Judge 
James Ashford affirmed the OAH and BWS decisions.  To do tree *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 7 removal on the well project, the solicitation reasonably 
required a C-27 license.  Alpha didn’t have a C-27, or list a 
subcontractor with one.  Given the environmental needs of the 
project, the court reasoned, BWS could demand a C-27 licensee.  
So Alpha’s bid was nonresponsive.  
The court rejected Alpha’s argument that BWS was estopped 
by statements in its bid rejection letter.  Estoppel requires 
detrimental reliance.  Because Alpha submitted its bid before the letter, there was no reliance on the letter and no estoppel. 
The circuit court opted not to address BWS’s argument that 
the hearings officer lacked jurisdiction to hear Alpha’s appeal. 
Alpha appealed to the ICA.  It made the same argument there 
that it makes now.  Alpha could remove the trees itself and was 
not required to list a tree trimming subcontractor with less 
than one percent of the contract value.  
In December 2023, the ICA published an opinion.  It 
affirmed.  
The ICA read HRS § 103D-302 the same way OAH, the circuit 
court and BWS did: construction bidders must list all subcontractors, but the procuring agency may waive this 
requirement if it’s in the State’s interest and the subs have 
less than one percent of the work.  The ICA affirmed OAH’s and 
the circuit court’s conclusions that (1) BWS did not waive the *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 8 listing requirement, and (2) BWS was not estopped from enforcing 
the requirement.   
The ICA addressed the Board of Water Supply’s 
jurisdictional challenge.  OAH had jurisdiction to hear Alpha’s 
appeal.  HRS § 103D-709(a) confers jurisdiction on OAH to 
“review and determine de novo, any request from any bidder, 
offeror, contractor[] . . . aggrieved by a determination of the 
chief procurement officer, head of a purchasing agency, or a designee of either officer.”  In the ICA’s view, subsection (a) 
establishes OAH’s jurisdiction.  
In contrast, the ICA read HRS § 103D-709(d)(2) as a 
standing rule.  That subsection states that any “bidder, 
offeror, contractor, or person that is a party to a protest of a 
solicitation . . . may initiate a proceeding under this section; 
provided that[]” the ten percent limit is met.  Because 
subsection (d) concerns a party’s right to bring suit, the ICA 
believed it relates to standing. 
The ICA drew standing’s meaning from Tax Found. of Hawaiʻi 
v. State: “In Hawaiʻ i state courts, standing is a prudential 
consideration regarding the ‘proper — and properly limited — role of courts in a democratic society’ and is not an issue of 
subject matter jurisdiction.”  144 Hawaiʻ i 175, 188, 439 P.3d 
127, 140 (2019).  The ICA concluded that Alpha satisfied HRS *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 9 § 103D-709(a)’s jurisdiction requirement, and that BWS did not 
challenge Alpha’s standing under HRS § 103D-709(d).  
Alpha and BWS filed dueling cert petitions.  Both reprised 
their positions.  Alpha appealed its disqualification.  BWS 
appealed the ICA’s holding that HRS § 103D-709(d)’s ten percent 
threshold concerned standing, not jurisdiction.  We accepted 
both sides’ certs. 
III. 
 
HRS § 103D’s ten percent requirement is jurisdictional and 
Alpha did not satisfy the requirement.  We therefore conclude that the Office of Administrative Hearings and our courts lacked 
jurisdiction to review BWS’s decision.   
To provide guidance, we also address the merits of Alpha’s 
appeal.  The Board of Water Supply properly disqualified Alpha’s bid.  
A. The ten percent requirement is jurisdictional 
 
 We first address the ICA’s holding that HRS § 103D-709(d)’s 
ten percent appeal requirement relates to standing, not 
jurisdiction.   
 The ICA erred.  HRS § 103D-709(d) is not a prudential 
standing requirement that an administrative hearings officer or court may waive.  Rather, the procurement code’s ten percent 
limit is the legislature’s jurisdictional command - a fixed and 
firm threshold to initiate a protest.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 10  Statutory interpretation starts with the statute’s words.  
Barker v. Young, 153 Hawaiʻ i 144, 148, 528 P.3d 217, 221 (2023).  
Our main duty is to determine and advance the legislature’s 
intent.  Id.  Ambiguity arises when there is more than one 
plausible textual meaning.  Id.  To clarify ambiguity, we 
consider sources outside the text, such as legislative history 
or the purpose and spirit of the law. 
 Id.  Statutory 
construction doctrines may also aid us.  Id. at 149, 528 P.3d at 222.  
The ICA used the plain text to reach its conclusion that 
the ten percent requirement is not jurisdictional.  HRS § 103D-
709(a) uses the word “jurisdiction.”  HRS § 103D-709(d) does not.  Thus, subsection (d) and its ten percent requirement does 
not involve jurisdiction.  The ICA also flags subsection (d)’s 
language that limits the parties who “may initiate a 
proceeding.”  That sounds like standing, says the ICA.    
Here is the text of HRS § 103D-709(a) and (d):  
(a) The several hearings officers appointed by the director 
of the department of commerce and consumer affairs pursuant 
to section 26- 9(f) shall have jurisdiction to review and 
determine de novo, any request from any bidder, offeror, contractor, or person aggrieved under section 103D- 106, or 
governmental body aggrieved by a determination of the chief 
procurement officer, head of a purchasing agency, or a 
designee of either officer under section 103D- 310, 103D-
701, or 103D- 702. 
. . . .  
(d) Any bidder, offeror, contractor, or person that is a 
party to a protest of a solicitation or award of a contract under section 103D- 302 or 103D- 303 that is decided pursuant *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 11 to section 103D- 701 may initiate a proceeding under this 
section; provided that: 
(1) For contracts with an estimated value of less 
than $1,000,000, the protest concerns a matter that is 
greater than $10,000; or 
(2) For contracts with an estimated value of 
$1,000,000 or more, the protest concerns a matter that is equal to no less than ten per cent of the estimated 
value of the contract.
 
(Emphases added.) 
True, because subsection (d) talks about who may initiate a 
proceeding, it is phrased like a standing requirement.  But that 
does not necessarily make it a standing matter.  
Tax Foundation stated that standing often depends on 
statutes.  144 Hawaiʻ i at 188, 439 P.3d at 140.  This court has 
repeatedly ruled that standing requirements may be “prescribed[] by legislative declarations of policy.”  Id.  Thus, “standing 
requirements can differ based on legislative enactments.”  Id.   
This court considers pertinent statutes to determine 
standing.  Sierra Club v. Dep’t of Transp., 115 Hawaiʻi 299, 319, 
167 P.3d 292, 312 (2007).  For instance, Tax Foundation held that the common law “injury in fact” test does not apply to declaratory judgment plaintiffs under HRS Chapter 632, because 
that test conflicts with the legislature’s intent in enacting 
Chapter 632.  144 Hawaiʻ i at 188-89, 439 P.3d at 140-41.   
Here, the ICA used the wording of HRS § 103D-709 to rule 
that § 709(d) relates to standing, not jurisdiction.  Then it 
quoted Tax Foundation: “In Hawaiʻ i state courts, standing is a *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 12 prudential consideration regarding the ‘proper — and properly 
limited — role of courts in a democratic society’ and is not an 
issue of subject matter jurisdiction.”  144 Hawaiʻ i at 188, 439 
P.3d at 140.  Thus, the ICA held that the ten percent 
requirement is a prudential standing matter. 
We are unpersuaded by this reasoning because it contradicts 
HRS § 103D-709(d)’s text and purpose.  Construed as a prudential 
standing requirement, HRS § 103D-709 becomes fuzzy, losing its 
uncomplicated meaning.  Reading HRS § 103D-709(d) as a flexible 
standing requirement, like the ICA does, creates discord between 
the prudential nature of standing in Hawaiʻi courts and 
subsection (d)’s straightforward ten percent requirement.  The 
legislature tightly limits procurement appeals involving 
million-dollar contracts.  Those disputes must involve “no less than ten per cent” of the contract’s value.   
HRS § 103D-709(d)’s text controls.  The ten percent 
requirement is firm, not stretchy.  Two reasons support our view 
that HRS § 103D-709(d)(2) relates to jurisdiction, not standing. 
 
First, the text says so.  There is no carve-out for a 
hearings officer to waive the ten percent requirement (unlike 
HRS § 103D-302(b)’s carve-out for an agency to waive the 
subcontractor listing requirement).  HRS § 103D-709 does not 
provide for any exceptions.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 13 Further, setting an amount-in-controversy minimum is a 
classic tool to define jurisdiction.  Hawaiʻi’s district courts 
have jurisdiction over civil matters worth less than $40,000.  
HRS § 604-5 (2016).  Otherwise, the matter belongs in a Hawaiʻ i 
circuit court.  HRS § 603-21.5 (2016 & Supp. 2017).  Similarly, 
federal diversity jurisdiction is only available if a party can 
make a claim for more than $75,000.  28 U.S. Code § 1332.  The $75,000 minimum is understood as jurisdictional even though it 
limits who may bring a diversity suit in federal court.   
In 
Hawaiʻi, standing typically focuses on the party seeking 
relief, not on the issues the party wants adjudicated.  Citizens 
for Prot. of N. Kohala Coastline v. Cnty. of Hawaiʻ i, 91 Hawaiʻ i 
94, 100, 979 P.2d 1120, 1126 (1999).  HRS § 103D-709(d) focuses 
on both.  The section’s first part discusses the party.  It says 
a “person that is a party to a protest . . . may initiate a 
proceeding.”  But subsection (d)(2) focuses on the issue.  It 
requires that “the protest concerns a matter” worth ten percent.  
Given the ten percent requirement’s straightforward meaning, we 
are unconvinced that the “may initiate a proceeding” language 
shifts the requirement from firm jurisdiction to flexible standing.  
Second, over the years, the legislature has frequently 
expressed an intent to streamline procurement award appeals.  A 
hard-and-fast ten percent requirement aligns with that mindset.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 14 The legislature’s purpose in enacting the ten percent limit 
was to constrain the number of procurement appeals, thereby 
allowing the government to procure faster and more cheaply.  
Other procurement code provisions and legislative history guide 
our conclusion.   
First, a review of the procurement code reveals that the 
legislature structured the procurement appeal process with speed 
and finality as the goal.  The first two levels of procurement review delay the government’s ability to complete the purchase.  
To start, an unhappy bidder sends a protest to the procuring 
agency.  HRS § 103D-701(a) (2012 & Supp. 2021).  The protest 
pauses the purchase.  HRS § 103D-701(f).  Next, if a party loses 
that protest, it may initiate an administrative hearing, subject 
to the ten percent requirement.  HRS § 103D-709(d).  The 
administrative proceeding also stays the procurement.  HRS 
§ 103D-709(h).   
When a party loses its OAH case, it may seek review in 
circuit court.  HRS § 103D-710(a) (2012).  A court case doesn’t stay the procurement.  HRS § 103D-710(b).  But the procurement 
code expedites the circuit court’s review.  It mandates that the 
circuit court schedule the case as expeditiously as practicable.  
HRS § 103D-710(d).  It limits the ability to introduce new 
evidence outside the administrative record.  Id.  It directs the 
circuit court issue a decision within thirty days, or lose *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 15 jurisdiction.  HRS § 103D-710(e).  A party that loses at the 
circuit court may appeal to the ICA, where “the appeal shall be 
given priority.”  HRS § 103D-710(f). 
Procurement appeals differ from ordinary cases.  The 
legislature has fast-tracked them.  The reason is simple and 
practical - the government entity needs to complete its projects 
without costly delays.  The legislature has often expressed this 
goal in its committee reports and statements of purpose.  
The legislature first enacted HRS § 103D-709 in 2009 as 
part of a broader procurement code revision.  The legislature’s conference committee report identified the main purpose of the 
late-aughts update: to “expedite Hawaiʻ i’s ability to use and 
benefit from federal economic stimulus funds.”  Conf. Comm. Rep. 
No. 45, in 2009 House Journal, at 1595.  The bill, H.B. 1470 
(Act 175), made several changes, all prioritizing speed.  It 
increased the number of contracts that qualify for expedited 
small purchase procedures.  Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 45, in 2009 
House Journal, at 1596.  It curtailed the timeline for 
administrative and circuit court review.  Id.  It enacted the ten percent requirement and required protesting parties to pay 
an appeal bond.  Id.  The procurement appeal provisions were 
temporary, set to expire in 2011.  Id.  
In 2012, the legislature passed H.B. 2265 (Act 173).  It 
further amended the procurement code.  It also made HRS § 103D-*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 16 709(d) permanent.  Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 62-12, in 2012 House 
Journal, at 1630.  The report stated the bill’s purpose: “to 
make the purchase of goods, services, and construction more 
efficient for state agencies.”  The legislature extended the law 
beyond the need to quickly use federal stimulus money to help 
Hawaiʻi handle a global recession.  Evidently, it liked how HRS 
§ 103D-709 worked.   
HRS § 103D-709 has remained untouched since 2012.  Twice, 
the legislature has amended other parts of Chapter 103D.  In 
2019, it added a filing fee to help recoup administrative 
hearing costs.  The legislature found that, “procurement bid 
challenges often result in project delays, funding lapses, and project cost increases.”  2019 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 73, § 1 at 
312.  
In 2021, the legislature revised the procurement code 
again.  It enacted a deadline for agencies to resolve 
construction and airport contract protests and increased the 
protest bond for procurement appeals.  2021 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 
224, §§ 2, 3 at 813-14.  The legislature found, “the procurement protest review process can be lengthy, causing project delays, 
thereby increasing project costs that are borne by taxpayers.”  
Id. at § 1 at 813.  
Taken together, these findings and enactments show a clear 
concern with speed, delay, finality, and cost.  The ten percent *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 17 limit is itself evidence of this concern.  On its face, the 
limit’s purpose is to reduce appeals.  The monetary qualifier 
serves as a jurisdictional limit.  Like monetary amounts tend to 
do.  
Our holding squares with how the Office of Administrative 
Hearings was deciding procurement appeals until Alpha’s appeal.  
Before then, OAH had repeatedly ruled (a) that the ten percent 
limit is jurisdictional and (b) a sub-ten-percent matter that disqualifies a bidder does not satisfy the limit by putting 100 
percent of the amount in controversy.  See, e.g., MEI Corp. v. 
Dep’t of Budget and Fiscal Servs., City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 
Case No. PDH-2019-004 (Haw. Off. Admin. Hearings Sept. 27, 2019) 
(Hearings Officer’s Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and 
Final Order), at 7-8.  As far as we can tell, the Hearings 
Officer in this case decided for the first time that the ten 
percent requirement concerns standing, not jurisdiction.  
Last, we address the ICA’s holding that the Board of Water 
Supply contested jurisdiction, but failed to challenge Alpha’s standing.  This ruling is technically accurate, but misses the 
point.  BWS never attacked Alpha’s standing because it argued 
that the ten percent requirement is jurisdictional.  The whole 
time, BWS argued that HRS § 103D-709(d)(2) foreclosed Alpha’s 
case.  We decline to conclude that BWS waived its argument. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 18 B.  Alpha did not satisfy the ten percent requirement 
Standing or jurisdiction?  Never mind, says Alpha.  It 
satisfied the ten percent requirement either way.  
Alpha argues its protest concerns the responsiveness of its 
whole bid and its attack against Beylik’s entire bid.  If Alpha 
won its protest, it would receive the contract.  After all, it 
bid the lowest.  Or, failing that, if Alpha’s protest 
successfully disqualified Beylik, there would be no responsive bidders, and BWS would presumably have to resolicit the 
contract.  Thus, Alpha insists that its protest concerns a 
matter worth 100 percent of the contract value, and therefore it 
satisfied the jurisdictional limit.  
BWS views things differently.  Alpha’s protest concerns 
either its failure to list the subcontractor – $6,800 to trim 
trees, or 0.11 percent of the contract – or its failure to 
secure a C-27 licensee for all tree trimming and removal – 
$95,000 or 1.59 percent of the contract.  Either way, Alpha is well below ten percent.  
HRS § 103D-709(d)(2) requires that a protest “concerns a 
matter” worth at least ten percent of the contract’s value.  Is 
the relevant “matter” the small tree trimming and removal line 
item that got Alpha into trouble?  Or is it 100 percent, because 
Alpha got disqualified?  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 19 In this respect, HRS § 103D-709(d)(2)’s ten percent 
requirement is ambiguous.  Evidently, the legislature did not 
consider how the ten percent limit would apply in a situation 
where a less-than-ten-percent issue resulted in a disqualified 
bidder. 
To clear up this ambiguity, we use statutory interpretation 
doctrines.  When a law’s meaning is unclear, this court 
considers the “reason and spirit of the law, and the cause which induced the legislature to enact it.”  HRS § 1-15 (2009).  This 
court may also consider other statutes in pari materia, a 
doctrine that construes ambiguous laws on the same subject 
matter together.  State v. Obrero, 151 
Hawaiʻi 472, 479, 517 P.3d 
755, 762 (2022).  We do so because “[w]hat is clear in one 
statute may be called in aid to explain what is doubtful in 
another.”  HRS § 1-16 (2009).   
Here, Alpha argues the legislature cannot have intended to 
permit an agency to disqualify a bidder based on a minor flaw 
without giving the bidder a forum to appeal that putatively 
unlawful disqualification.  We disagree.  Given the legislature’s oft-expressed dismay about delays caused by 
procurement appeals, we believe limiting small-scale appeals is 
exactly what the legislature intended. 
Alpha claims an incongruity between the one percent waiver 
rule and ten percent appeal requirement.  Alpha’s argument boils *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 20 down to “how come 1 percent is important for listing a 
subcontractor, yet 9.9 percent isn’t important for appealing?”  
The answer is the same as the answer to the ten percent 
jurisdictional question – the legislature has expressed a low 
tolerance for procurement appeals.  
In many ways – protest bonds, expedited timelines for 
reviews, and the ten percent requirement – the legislature shows 
that it does not view procurement disputes as ordinary civil litigation.  The legislature seeks to balance the virtues of 
procurement appeals – rule of law, protecting the public from 
costly mistakes - against the costs, delay and inefficiency in 
government purchasing.   
Per HRS § 103D-709(d)’s text, purpose, and legislative 
history, a disqualified bidder cannot sidestep the ten percent 
requirement.  We hold that a sub-ten-percent matter that 
disqualifies a bidder does not satisfy the jurisdictional limit 
by placing 100 percent of the contract amount in controversy.  Our decision does not displace existing OAH administrative 
caselaw holding that bidders may aggregate smaller claims to 
meet the ten percent threshold.  See Nan, Inc. v. Honolulu Auth. 
For Rapid Transp., Case No. PDH-2015-004 (Off. Admin. Hearings 
May 28, 2015) (Hearings Officer’s Findings of Fact, Conclusions 
of Law, and Decision), at 16-18.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 21 Next, we briefly address Alpha’s proposed distinction 
between offensive and defensive procurement appeals.  That 
difference lacks a basis in HRS § 103D-709’s language, 
legislative history, or purpose.  It does not alter our reading 
of the statute’s language and meaning.  
Last, we note that no party briefed the issue of whether 
judicial review under HRS § 632-1 (2016) may be available per 
Alakaʻi Na Keiki, Inc. v. Matayoshi, 127 Hawaiʻi 263, 277 P.3d 
988 (2012). 
C.  BWS properly disqualified Alpha’s bid 
Because we rule that OAH and our courts lacked 
jurisdiction, we need not resolve the merits of Alpha’s bid 
protest.  Due to procurement’s public importance and the 
infrequency of procurement cases in Hawaiʻi’s appellate courts, 
we exercise our supervisory power under HRS § 602-4 (2016) to 
provide guidance to lower courts.  See also, e.g., State v. 
David, 141 Hawaiʻ i 315, 327, 409 P.3d 719, 731 (2017) (providing 
guidance).   
Alpha divides the solicitation into two categories of work: 
tree removal and tree trimming.  Alpha argues that its C-17 
license entitled it to perform tree removal.  And, it says, the 
principles of estoppel or waiver force BWS to forgive its 
failure to list its <1 percent C-27 subcontractor.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 22 Alpha is wrong on both fronts.  BWS may require a C-27 
license for tree removal.  And BWS had no obligation to waive 
Alpha’s failure to list a subcontractor.  
In Alpha’s view, the Contractors License Board defines the 
scope of a C-17 license as a matter of law.  A CLB member (in a 
non-binding email advisory) informed BWS that Alpha’s C-17 
excavation license covered tree removal.  So Alpha may use its 
C-17 license to remove trees.  BWS violated licensure law, Alpha’s argument goes, by asking for a more specialized C-27 
landscaping license. 
Not so.  In effect, Alpha asks us to hold as a matter of 
law that government agencies must always accept the minimum 
competence for each job.  It also asks us to hold that a 
project’s specific needs are inconsequential; the general 
licensing laws always control.  Alpha misses the point of 
contractor licensing laws.  They protect the public from shoddy 
workmanship.  See HRS § 444-4(2) (2013) (the purpose of contractor licensing laws is “protection of the general 
public”).  Licensing doesn’t exist to force the government to 
hire less qualified contractors.   
Here, this project’s specific ecological needs called for a 
C-27 contractor.  The solicitation included several 
environmental protection specs: supervision of tree trimming by 
an arborist and ornithologist, protecting surrounding *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 23 vegetation, and leaving the site in as good a condition as the 
contractor found it.  The solicitation asked for a C-27 tree 
removal and tree trimming license.  Alpha was not entitled to 
fulfill the work with its C-17 excavation license.  
When it procures, a government entity participates in the 
private market.  Like any private actor, if BWS wants a C-27 
certified landscaper to do certain tasks, it may ask for one.  
BWS did not usurp the CLB’s authority when it specified license requirements for its project.  BWS may enforce its solicitation 
terms.  
Next, BWS had discretion to disqualify Alpha.  Even if 
Alpha could do the tree removal, it failed to name a tree 
trimming subcontractor.  HRS § 103D-302(b) is clear: 
If the invitation for bids is for construction, it shall 
specify that all bids include the name of each person or 
firm to be engaged by the bidder as a joint contractor or 
subcontractor in the performance of the contract and the 
nature and scope of the work to be performed by each. Construction bids that do not comply with this requirement 
may be accepted if acceptance is in the best interest of 
the State and the value of the work to be performed by the 
joint contractor or subcontractor is equal to or less than 
one per cent of the total bid amount. 
On a construction project, listing all subcontractors is 
mandatory.  Id.  BWS had the option to waive the condition if 
the work was “equal to or less than one per cent of the total 
bid amount.”  Id.  But BWS chose not to.  It found that excusing Alpha’s mistake was not in the county’s best interest.  For good *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 24 reason.  Alpha lacked the proper license and its bid barely beat 
Beylik’s.  BWS could disqualify Alpha.  
Waiver and estoppel do not change this calculus.  As the 
circuit court and ICA rightly noted, the bid rejection letter 
cannot estop BWS.  Alpha didn’t rely on the letter’s inaccurate 
statement.  Alpha submitted a defective bid first, then BWS made 
the statement.  Because there was no reliance, there can be no 
estoppel.  Furuya v. Ass’n of Apartment Owners of Pac. Monarch, 
Inc., 137 Hawaiʻi 371, 387, 375 P.3d 150, 166 (2016) (“The 
essence of promissory estoppel is detrimental reliance on a 
promise.”) (cleaned up).   
There was also no waiver.  Waiver requires the knowing 
relinquishment of a right.  Coon v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 98 
Hawaiʻi 233, 261, 47 P.3d 348, 376 (2002).  BWS’s misstatement 
was not a knowing waiver. 
IV. 
We reverse the ICA’s holding that the ten percent 
requirement relates to standing, not jurisdiction.  We hold that    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 25 HRS § 103D-709(d) is jurisdictional and that Alpha could not 
satisfy the ten percent requirement.
