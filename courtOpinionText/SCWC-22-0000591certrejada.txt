rejected. Electronically Filed

Dkt. 25 ORD2 
 /s/ Kevin A.K. Souza  2. The petition for a writ of mandamus or 
prohibition is denied.  Petitioners have alternative means to 
seek relief because 1CCV-22-0000508 is ongoing and the vexatious 
litigant order and order addressing attorney fees and costs may 
be reviewed on appeal.  Petitioners have also not demonstrated a 
clear and indisputable right to relief because it is within the 
circuit court’s jurisdiction and discretion to decide the motion 
for attorney fees and costs.  An extraordinary writ is thus not 
warranted.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawaiʻi 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 
334, 338-39 (1999); Honolulu Advertiser, Inc. v. Takao, 59 Haw. 
237, 241–42, 580 P.2d 58, 62 (1978). 
3.
 The request for a stay is denied.  If and when 
appropriate, Petitioners may seek a stay in the circuit court 
pursuant to Hawaiʻ i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 62 and Hawaiʻ i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 8. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawaii, April 18, 2023.
