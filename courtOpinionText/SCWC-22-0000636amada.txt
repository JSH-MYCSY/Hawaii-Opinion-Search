RECKTENWALD, C.J., McKENNA, AND EDDINS, JJ., AND 
CIRCUIT JUDGE NAKAMOTO IN PLACE OF GINOZA, J., RECUSED; 
AND DEVENS, J., DISSENTING 
 
AMENDED OPINION OF THE COURT BY EDDINS, J. 
This case concerns when lack of counsel constitutes 
structural error, and thereby invalidates fundamentally fair 
Child Protective Act proceedings that serve a child’s best interest. 
We hold that there is no structural error when the family 
court does not provide counsel to an indigent parent who absents  
 
  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
themself from the case’s initial proceedings and neglects the 
court’s process for appointing counsel. 
Because we find no structural error, and this years-long 
parental rights termination case was fundamentally fair, we 
affirm the family court’s order that revoked foster custody, 
granted permanent custody of the children to DHS, and ordered 
the permanent plan of adoption by the children’s adult half-
sister. 
I. 
In May 2017, Appellee-Mother (Mother) gave birth to a 
daughter, Taylor (to protect the minor’s privacy, we use a 
pseudonym). Both Taylor and Mother tested positive for opiates 
and methamphetamines. The hospital notified the Department of 
Human Services about a threat of abuse and neglect. See
 Hawai‘i 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 350-1.1 (2015). 
At the time, Father was incarcerated and Mother on felony 
probation. 
They never married. 
In April 2019, Mother and Father had another daughter, 
Jordan (again, a pseudonym). Mother disclosed that she took 
suboxone (an opiate withdrawal medication) during her pregnancy. 
Medical personnel monitored Jordan for withdrawal symptoms. 
Like before, the hospital notified DHS of a threat of abuse and 
neglect. 
2  
 
  
  
  
  
 
  
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
On June 6, 2019, DHS filed a “Petition for Family 
Supervision” in the Family Court of the Second Circuit. HRS 
§ 587A-12 (2018). DHS served Mother and Father with a summons 
to appear in family court on June 21, 2019. HRS § 587A-12(c)(2) 
(“The court shall conduct[] [a] return hearing[] . . . within 
fifteen days after the petition is filed”). The family court 
also appointed a Guardian Ad Litem (GAL) for the girls. HRS 
§ 587A-16(a) (2018). Both the GAL and DHS social worker submitted reports throughout the case. Id.; HRS § 587A-18 
(2018). 
Neither parent showed up at the June 21, 2019 hearing. The 
family court granted DHS’ oral motion for temporary foster custody. See HRS § 587A-26 (2018). “‘Temporary foster custody’ 
means a legal status created under this chapter with or without a court order, whereby the department temporarily assumes the 
duties and rights of a foster custodian of a child.” HRS 
§ 587A-4 (2018). The court set a return hearing for July 2, 2019. HRS § 587A-28 (2018) (“When a petition has been filed, 
the court shall conduct a return hearing within fifteen days 
of[] . . . [t]he date a decision is announced by the court 
during a temporary foster custody hearing.”). 
Mother appeared at the return hearing. The family court 
took no substantive action. It continued temporary foster 
custody. Per the court minutes, the court scheduled a “Return 
3  
 
  
  
 
  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Hearing w/ Counsel” in two weeks. Because the record on appeal 
lacks transcripts for the case’s initial proceedings, it is 
unclear whether the court directed Mother to return to court 
after completing the second circuit’s one-page application for 
court-appointed counsel, or instructed her to return to court 
with retained counsel. 
Mother missed the return hearing on July 16, 2019. Based 
on the DHS social worker’s testimony, the family court granted DHS foster custody. HRS § 587A-15 (2018).  The court found that 
the children’s “physical/psychological health/welfare has been 
harmed or is subject to threatened harm by the acts or omissions 
of mother and father, to-wit; threatened harm due to substance 
abuse that lead[s] to impaired parenting.” See HRS § 587A-7 
(2018). 
Mother disengaged from the case. Father too. Parental 
disengagement, the parties agree, is not an uncommon feature of chapter 587A proceedings. Still, parents frequently re-engage. 
About four months later, on November 5, 2019, Mother 
appeared in court. Nothing substantive happened. Like before, the court minutes reflect that the court scheduled a “Return 
Hearing w/ Counsel.”  Again, it is unclear whether the court 
advised Mother to fill out an application for court-appointed 
counsel. But we believe that the court was acquainted with the 
Family Court of the Second Circuit’s standard indigency form and 
4  
 
   
 
  
  
   
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
understood HRS § 587A-17(a) (2018) (“The court may appoint an 
attorney to represent a legal parent who is indigent based on 
court-established guidelines.”); HRS § 587A-25(d) (2018) (“If a 
party is without counsel or a guardian ad litem, the court shall 
inform the party of the right to be represented by counsel and 
the right to appeal.”); and HRS § 571-8.5(a)(8) (2018) (“The 
district family judges may: . . . Appoint . . . attorneys to 
represent parties in accordance with law”). 
That same day, after court, Mother applied for counsel. 
One week later, on November 12, the court appointed her counsel. 
Mother did not make the return hearing on November 26, 
2019. But counsel appeared.  The court continued all prior orders. Then, on December 3, 2019, Mother made it to court. 
Again, counsel appeared. With counsel’s aid, Mother agreed to 
DHS’ service plan. See HRS § 587A-27 (2018). Per the plan, she 
entered drug treatment. 
Thereafter, Mother engaged in the case and appeared at all 
court hearings side-by-side with an attorney. Mother had a 
lawyer to the case’s end – nearly three years later. 
As Mother’s case progressed, she appeared on the surface to 
do well, complying with the service plans. After a year of DHS 
foster custody, the court entered a family supervision order. 
See HRS § 587A-4 (“Family supervision” is “the legal status in 
which a child’s legal custodian is willing and able, with the 
5  
 
  
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
assistance of a service plan, to provide the child with a safe 
family home.”). The children reunited with Mother. 
For almost one year, the children and Mother lived 
together. First in a drug treatment program for woman with 
children. Then with the girls’ adult half-sister on Oʻ ahu. And 
eventually with Father in a 20-foot trailer next to a home in 
Wailuku that Mother’s father owned. 
Family supervision proved unworkable. Because of abuse and 
neglect concerns, and Mother’s drug use, in June 2021, DHS asked 
the court to revoke family supervision and reinstate DHS foster 
custody. See HRS §§ 587A-7 and 587A-15(a)(2) (2018). DHS 
reported that the two girls were developmentally maladjusted and 
physically aggressive. Both the DHS social worker and GAL 
described the girls as “feral.” The DHS social worker informed 
the court that a good Samaritan had found four year-old Taylor 
running unattended on a street blocks from where they lived. 
Mother also deceived DHS about her drug use and treatment 
efforts. DHS reported that Mother continued to use unlawful 
drugs, refused to drug test when asked, and despite saying she regularly attended drug treatment, no-showed for virtually every 
treatment session. DHS concluded “the children are not safe in 
[her] care.” 
After a status hearing on June 29, 2021, attended by Mother 
and her counsel, the family court revoked family supervision. 
6  
 
 
    
 
  
  
  
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
HRS § 587A-15(a)(2). DHS again took custody of the children. 
DHS then placed the girls on Oʻ ahu with their paternal half-
sister. HRS § 587A-15(b)(2). Since June 30, 2021, the children 
have lived there, under their sister’s care. 
Nearly three months after the children re-entered foster 
custody, the GAL reported that they were happy in their sister’s 
home. They bonded well with her. Taylor, in particular, 
displayed noticeable improvement in her social interactions and 
behavior. The girls enjoyed pre-school and adjusted nicely to 
the structure their half-sister had established. 
In October 2021, Mother agreed to her fifth service plan. 
The plan, like the others, required Mother to complete substance abuse treatment. 
By March 2022, both the GAL and DHS social worker reported 
that the girls were “doing exceedingly well.” The DHS social 
worker had previously reported that the girls kicked and hit 
her, but now she said, they were well-mannered. Their speech 
improved. They lived in a clean home. The girls greatly 
benefitted from a stable home life with an “extremely devoted” caretaker. They were “thriving.” 
In May 2022, DHS moved to terminate parental rights (TPR). 
HRS §§ 587A-4, 587A-32 (2018), and 587A-33 (2018).  DHS had 
filed the petition for family supervision almost three years 
earlier, and the girls’ time in foster custody totaled 21 
7  
 
   
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
months. The DHS social worker submitted a permanent plan 
recommending adoption by the half-sister. HRS § 587A-32(a)(1) 
(“The permanent plan shall[] . . . [s]tate whether the 
permanency goal for the child will be achieved through adoption, 
legal guardianship, or permanent custody.”). 
The court set a TPR trial date. Shortly before trial, 
Mother’s counsel moved to withdraw. Counsel declared their 
relationship “irreparable.” The court granted the motion and appointed Mother new counsel. On September 23, 2022, the family 
court held a trial. Mother and Father both appeared with their 
own counsel. 
DHS had the burden of proof. HRS § 587A-33. It presented 
evidence that the children’s living conditions with Mother were 
unsafe. DHS recounted, among other events, the incident where 
residents found Taylor running down the street blocks from the 
home. A psychological evaluation revealed that Taylor felt 
lingering fear due to Mother leaving her alone in the trailer. Testimony also centered on the girls’ behavioral issues under 
Mother’s care – they were described as “out of control” - and 
how it reflected neglectful parenting.  DHS introduced evidence 
about Mother’s drug use, deception, failed treatment efforts, 
and her inability to follow the service plans. And DHS 
presented substantial evidence regarding the girls’ positive 
transformation while in their sister’s care. 
8  
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The family court terminated Mother’s and Father’s parental 
rights. It found that Mother and Father were not willing and 
able to provide the children with a safe family home, even with 
the assistance of a service plan. HRS § 587A-33(a)(1)-(2). The 
court ruled that DHS’ permanent plan with the goal of adoption 
by the girls’ half-sister served the best interest of the 
children. HRS § 587A-33(a)(3). 
One month after the family court’s order terminating 
parental rights, Mother’s trial counsel moved to withdraw, saying Mother was unsatisfied with his representation. That 
same day, Mother’s new lawyer filed a notice of appeal in the 
ICA. Later, the court granted her trial lawyer’s motion to 
withdraw. (The procedural and jurisdictional issues surrounding 
the switch in lawyers have no consequence here.) 
Mother appealed. Father did not. Mother raised two 
issues. First, she argued (for the first time) that the family 
court erred by appointing the GAL because the GAL had previously represented Mother in a different matter. Second, she argued 
that the family court committed structural error by failing to 
appoint her new counsel after granting her trial counsel’s post-
trial motion to withdraw. Mother said she could not preserve 
the guardian ad litem issue because “she was stuck with an 
attorney” who disagreed with her, “and she was not appointed 
another attorney after he was discharged.” 
9  
 
  
  
  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
DHS responded that Mother’s first point of error lacked 
merit because she did not raise it in the family court. DHS 
also maintained that no structural error occurred. The family 
court did not appoint Mother new counsel because she had already 
hired someone. Mother was never without counsel after the 
trial. 
The ICA ordered supplemental briefing. It wanted the 
parties to examine “whether appointment of counsel for Mother was timely.” 
In a memorandum opinion, the ICA held that the failure to 
immediately appoint counsel constituted structural error: “the 
Family Court’s failure to appoint Mother counsel for 144 days, 
between June 21, 2019 (when temporary foster custody was 
requested and granted) to November 12, 2019 (when counsel was 
appointed) was structural error which requires vacatur of orders 
affecting custody of the Children from June 21, 2019.”  The ICA 
did not address Mother’s argument about the GAL’s putative conflict. 
The ICA’s opinion invalidated all custody orders affecting 
the best interest of the children. The CPA proceedings had to 
start over. 
The GAL applied for cert. The Department of Human Services 
joined the application. We accepted cert.

II. 
In Hawaiʻ i, “parents have a substantive liberty interest in 
the care, custody, and control of their children.” In re Doe, 
99 Hawaiʻ i 522, 533, 57 P.3d 447, 458 (2002).  To support that 
fundamental right, the Hawai
ʻi Constitution’s due process clause, 
article I, section 5, confers parents a right to counsel in 
Child Protective Act proceedings. In re T.M., 131 Hawaiʻ i 419, 
421, 319 P.3d 338, 340 (2014). “[C]ourts must appoint counsel 
for indigent parents once DHS files a petition to assert foster 
custody over a child.” Id.
What if the court does not? In re L.I.
 introduced 
structural error – an error that upsets the integrity of the 
judicial process - to CPA proceedings. 149 Hawaiʻi 118, 122, 482 
P.3d 1079, 1083 (2021). Because of the constitutionally 
protected liberty interest at stake, once parental rights are substantially affected, the family court should provide counsel 
to an indigent parent. 
Id.Otherwise, structural error 
results. 
And thus, despite a fundamentally fair, error-free 
process that serves a child’s best interest, the case starts 
over. (L.I was published after DHS filed a petition for family 
supervision in the present case.) 
T.M. and L.I. involved cases where a structural error 
solution was evident. 
11  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
In T.M., all the parties except T.M.’s 15 year-old mother 
had counsel throughout the case. 131 Hawai‘i at 422, 319 P.3d at 
341. The young mother actively engaged with the case from the 
very start. Yet 19 months passed between her child’s placement 
in foster custody and the court’s appointment of counsel to 
protect her interests. Id. at 433, 319 P.3d at 352. She later 
lost her right to parent. Id. at 429, 319 P.3d at 348. 
This court disapproved. 
We didn’t adopt structural error 
then. But we ruled that no matter what, the mother did not 
receive a constitutionally sound process. She lacked a lawyer 
“to inform her of the limitations of the guardianship approach 
and of the possibility that if other options were pursued, her parental rights would be in jeopardy”; “advise her of 
significant deadlines” (like the two-year cutoff to provide a 
safe family home); or provide “necessary assistance to prepare 
for the . . . termination hearing.” Id. at 432-33, 319 P.3d at 
351-52. Had mother received counsel sooner, this court said, there’s a chance she would’ve followed the family service plan’s 
terms and provided T.M. with a safe family home at an earlier date. Id. at 433, 319 P.3d at 352. 
L.I. also had clear-cut structural flaws. There, the 
family court appointed the mother counsel three months after the 
court awarded DHS foster care, and 10 months after DHS’ initial 
petition for family supervision. 149 Hawaiʻi at 119-20, 482 P.3d 
12  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
at 1080-81. During that time, the mother had engaged with the 
case. She participated in court hearings, consented to family 
supervision, and agreed to two service plans. Id.Yet she had 
no lawyer to help navigate family court and chapter 587A’s demands. 
L.I. directed family courts to appoint counsel for indigent 
parents when DHS files a petition for family supervision 
because, at that point, parental rights are substantially affected. Id. The failure to do so, this court ruled, amounts 
to structural error, requiring automatic vacatur of best 
interest findings without having to show harmful error. Id. at 
123, 482 P.3d at 1084. 
The T.M. and L.I. mothers approached their chapter 587A 
cases in the same way. They were involved from the first 
hearing. The mothers actively engaged in the case before 
receiving counsel. T.M.’s mother participated in an ʻohana 
conference, and she agreed to two HRS § 587A-27 family service plans. T.M., 131 Hawaiʻ i at 423-24, 426, 319 P.3d at 342-43, 
345. As for L.I.’s mother, she consented to family supervision 
and also agreed to two service plans over a ten month period. 
L.I., 149 Hawaiʻ i at 119-20, 482 P.3d at 1080-81. Both mothers 
attended every court hearing. Despite their engagement, the 
family court did not offer them court-appointed counsel. As the 
government worked to strip the mothers’ parental rights, they 
13  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
fended for themselves. We remanded both cases for new 
proceedings. 
Last year, In re JH tacked from a “no questions asked” 
structural error approach in CPA right to counsel cases. 152 
Hawaiʻi 373, 526 P.3d 350 (2023). “[W]hen, how long, and the 
reason” a parent goes without counsel matter when it comes to 
assessing whether structural error nullifies best interest 
determinations. Id. at 379, 526 P.3d at 356. 
In JH, the parents appeared at the first hearing and were 
appointed counsel. Id. at 377, 526 P.3d at 354. But the 
parents didn’t show for the next hearing. Id.So the court 
discharged counsel. Id.Five months later, the parents 
reappeared. Then counsel represented them to the end, including 
a TPR trial. Id.JH held that counsel’s absence during CPA 
proceedings does not always vacate best interest findings. Id.
at 376, 526 P.3d at 353. There are limits to the right to 
counsel in parental termination cases. JH clarified that an 
indigent parent’s constitutional right to counsel “is not automatically violated when a beneficiary of that right voluntarily absents themself from family court proceedings.” 
Id. at 379, 526 P.3d at 356. 
JH pointed out that neither T.M. nor L.I. required reversal 
for structural error when an indigent parent is not from start 
14  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
to finish represented by court-appointed counsel in CPA 
proceedings. Id. at 378, 526 P.3d at 355. 
Automatic reversal of best interest findings due to a 
parent’s voluntary absence undercuts the paramount principle 
controlling chapter 587A proceedings – a fair resolution that 
serves the best interest of the child. For sure, the family 
court must protect a parent’s constitutional right to parent 
their child. And the family court must honor a parent’s constitutional right to counsel. But if an appellate court 
robotically vacates best interest findings, “then the time it 
takes to permanently place a child drags on.” Id. at 379, 526 
P.3d at 356. JH talked about structural error’s downside. The 
child may suffer. And it’s the child’s best interest that 
steers a chapter 587A case. We repeated that it is “in the 
child’s best interest and overall well being to limit the 
potential for years of litigation and instability.” Id. (citing 
In re RGB, 123 Hawaiʻ i 1, 26, 229 P.3d 1066, 1091 (2010)). 
15  JH held that a gap in legal representation due to a 
parent’s voluntary absence did not – considering everything -
warrant unravelling the proceedings and vacating an order 
terminating parental rights. See 152 Hawaiʻ i at 379, 526 P.3d at 
356. We declined to apply structural error to cases involving 
discharged counsel because structural error is inflexible and ignores the practicalities of the situation. Id. 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Thus, JH established that there is no structural error 
after a family court discharges counsel, and then later re-
appoints counsel in CPA proceedings. Id. at 380, 526 P.3d at 
357. So long as the parent receives a fundamentally fair 
procedure, a best interest determination that results in a 
termination of parental rights will go undisturbed. Id.
Due process was satisfied in JH. Id. at 381, 526 P.3d at 
358. No hearings happened between the five-month gap between when the parents voluntary absented themselves and then re-
engaged in the proceedings. Id. When the parents reappeared 
and re-engaged, so did counsel. Id. After that, counsel 
represented the parents until the end of the TPR trial. In all, 
the parents were represented for 22 of 27 months. Id. Since 
there was no structural error, we examined the trial. 
Substantial evidence supported the family court’s HRS § 587A-
33(a) termination of parental rights findings. Id.
In the present case, the family court did not appoint 
counsel for Mother at the initial proceedings. But it was Mother’s failure to show up in court and follow the court’s 
process that foiled legal representation. Once Mother appeared, 
completed an application for court-appointed counsel, and 
engaged, she received legal representation. Thereafter, counsel 
represented Mother for 34 uninterrupted months. Further, the 
record shows that after Mother received counsel, she had 
16  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
opportunities to reunite with her children before the family 
court terminated her parental rights. 
The delay in receiving counsel did not harm Mother’s case. 
Had the court provided the absent Mother a lawyer during the 
initial hearing, what would that attorney have done? See JH
, 
152 Hawaiʻi at 380, 526 P.3d at 357 (“If a parent chooses not to 
appear in court or decides not to communicate with counsel, then 
counsel is hard-pressed to understand the parent’s present 
objectives, and is challenged to provide sound, ethical 
representation.”). The dissent says that counsel may 
“immediately contact and appropriately advise the parent.” If 
contact and the attorney-client relationship are established, then counsel would likely communicate the value of 
participation. But at this stage, we do not believe that lack 
of counsel upsets a “trial’s entire framework, its structure.” 
JH
, 152 Hawaiʻi at 379, 526 P.3d at 356.   
An unbending structural error approach unfairly benefits a 
voluntarily absent parent at the expense of their child. 
“A 
parent’s choice not to appear in court or maintain contact with 
counsel should not undermine a child’s interests in permanency.” 
Id. Because the best interest of the child are foremost, a 
family court cannot simply freeze the case to await the emergence of a disinterested parent and that parent’s compliance 
17  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
with the court’s process for appointing counsel. See HRS 
§ 587A-2 (2018). 
The dissent’s position may create situations where the best 
interests of the child are waylaid by structural error’s 
rigidity. Consider a parent who did not appear in court until 
the last day of a TPR trial. If the court did not appoint 
counsel for that parent at the case’s initiation, then 
structural error applies, and there is no harmlessness review. Therefore, each best interest finding gets vacated, and the 
court must re-start the proceedings, thereby upending the 
child’s interest in permanency. 
We hold that a parent’s constitutional right to counsel is 
not invoked for structural error purposes until they appear and 
engage in the case, which includes complying with the court’s 
process for determining indigency. 
A. Mother Received a Fundamentally Fair Proceeding 
When the government uses its power to untie the parent-
child relationship, article I, section 5 of our state 
constitution demands a fundamentally fair process. 
But here, the ICA gave “no attention to whether the 
proceedings [after Mother received counsel] were fundamentally 
fair.” JH
, 152 Hawaiʻi at 379, 526 P.3d at 356.  The ICA applied 
structural error, thereby invalidating the family court’s 
18  
 
 
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
findings and conclusions advancing the best interest of the 
children. 
Mother’s decision to disengage did not trigger structural 
error. She absented herself for almost the first five months of 
the case. Once on track, however, Mother had legal 
representation at every hearing, including the TPR trial. 
Mother had a “meaningful opportunity to participate in [her] 
case with the aid of counsel.” Id. at 381, 526 P.3d at 358. 
After Mother received counsel, DHS and the family court gave her 
time to get on her feet. She attended drug treatment and 
parenting classes. The family court granted her family 
supervision. She had the opportunity to reunite with the 
children, something she didn’t have when she neglected the first 
several months of the case. 
The service plans, the court later found, gave Mother the 
best chance at “remedying the problems which put the Children at 
substantial risk of being harmed in the family home.” Within two weeks of being appointed counsel, Mother committed to her 
first service plan. Throughout the case, Mother agreed with and 
committed to five service plans, all with the aid of counsel. 
After six months of participating in a drug treatment 
program, Mother showed she was willing and able to provide the 
children with a safe family home. See HRS § 587A-4. The family 
court credited her efforts by granting family supervision. Then 
19  
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
with counsel’s help, Mother seemingly complied with the terms of 
the various plans and provided the children with a safe family 
home. Compare T.M., 131 Hawaiʻ i at 433, 319 P.3d at 352 (“It may 
be that had counsel been appointed sooner, Petitioner may have 
been able to comply with the terms of the family plan and 
provided T.M. with a safe family home at an earlier date.”). 
But even with counsel’s assistance and the service plans, Mother 
struggled. 
The family court revoked family supervision after 
nearly a year. 
The court found that “Mother and the Father were given 
every reasonable opportunity to complete their services and effectuate positive changes to enable them to provide a safe family home with the assistance of a service plan in order to be 
reunified with the Children.” Mother tried. 
But unfortunately, 
she could not comply. 
Some parents in Chapter 587A proceedings suffer from 
substance use disorders. Substance use disorders are “patterns of substance use that cause damage to physical or mental health 
or lead to clinically significant functional impairment or distress.” Nora D. Volkow & Carlos Blanco, Substance Use
Disorders: A Comprehensive Update of Classification, 
Epidemiology, Neurobiology, Clinical Aspects, Treatment and 
Prevention, 22 World Psychiatry 203, 204 (2023) (footnote

[https://perma.cc/7JN6-Z3ZT]. In Hawai‘ i, it is estimated that 
each year “500-650 children (about half of confirmed cases of 
child abuse or neglect) are at high risk of entering foster care 
because of their parent’s substance use disorder.”

https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9783818/pdf/hjhsw8112_S

parental alcohol and drug use contributed to about half of the 
child abuse and neglect cases. Id.
Mothers and fathers struggling with substance use may still 
satisfactorily parent their children. They may, in fact, be really good parents. “Parental substance use or SUD does not by 
itself constitute [child abuse and neglect].” Id.Rather, 
“[child abuse and neglect] occurs when . . . children’s needs are not met because of the parent’s use of substances.” Id.
We are mindful that HRS § 587A-7(a)(7) includes “history of 
substance abuse by the child’s family” as a factor to consider 
“when determining whether a child’s family is willing and able 
to provide the child with a safe family home.” But we stress that a parent’s substance use, unaccompanied by evidence 
21  
 
  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
relating to HRS § 587A-7(a)(1) or other HRS § 587A-7 safe family 
home factors, does not support the loss of parental rights. 
Mother does not argue on appeal that her case was 
fundamentally unfair. Or that there was not substantial 
evidence to support terminating her parental rights. The family 
court cited the witnesses’ testimony and the exhibits (reports 
from GAL and the DHS social worker) for support. The court 
found that Mother was willing, but ultimately unable to provide the children with a safe family home now or in the future, even 
with a service plan. See HRS § 587A-33(a)(1), (2). The court 
concluded that the children were thriving in their sister’s care. And there was “clear and convincing evidence that it 
[was] in their best interest to remain where they are and be 
adopted and for the parental rights to be terminated.” See HRS 
§ 587A-33(a)(1), (2). Mother does not challenge the family court’s best interest findings. 
B. Appointing Counsel in CPA Proceedings The family court’s decision to forego an early indigency 
determination troubles us. At the start, Mother appeared in court for two hearings. She didn’t make back-to-back 
appearances, but when she showed, the court had an easy 
opportunity to make an indigency finding and appoint counsel. 
22  
 
 
   
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
During oral argument, the parties disagreed on most things. 
They agreed though that CPA cases overwhelmingly involve 
indigent parents. 
To fortify the right to counsel and (ideally) decrease 
representation-related appeals that may undo best interest 
findings, we direct family courts to make an indigency 
determination at a parent’s first appearance in a chapter 587A 
proceeding that substantially affects parental rights. HRS § 602-4 (2016). 
Courts may make this indigency finding after an on-the-
record colloquy covering financial status. Or courts may on-
the-spot have a parent complete a standard application for 
counsel form. (Like the simple form Mother eventually filled 
out, or the “application for court-appointed counsel” form used 
by the third circuit in T.M.
, 131 Hawaiʻi at 422, 319 P.3d at 
341.) Also, DHS typically has information related to a parent’s 
financial plight, the parties pointed out, so DHS may be able to 
aid the court’s indigency determination. If there’s uncertainty 
regarding indigency or resistance from a parent, the right to counsel demands that the family court appoint counsel. 
After the court makes an indigency determination at the 
first hearing attended by a parent, the family court should 
expeditiously undertake efforts to appoint counsel. 
(That is, 
if the court hasn’t already secured counsel before that 
23  
 
 
   
  
  
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
hearing.) We recognize that the availability of counsel and the 
immediate demands of chapter 587A may pose challenges. But 
determining indigency when the parent first appears will 
activate the right to counsel, curb structural error appeals, 
and advance the child’s interest in permanency. 
C. Mother Waived Any Conflict with the GAL 
We turn to the two points of error Mother raised in her 
opening brief to the ICA. The case has spanned more than five 
years. Judicial efficiency and a permanent resolution that 
serves the best interest of the children favor resolving the 
merits here instead of remanding the case to the ICA. 
First, Mother argued that the family court erred by 
appointing the GAL because the GAL had a conflict – she 
previously represented Mother in a different matter. 
Mother did not raise her concern in family court. She 
leveled her conflict accusation for the first time on appeal. 
She concedes there is nothing in the record regarding a possible conflict. In the GAL’s answering brief to the ICA, the GAL 
declared that she discussed the issue with Mother and her 
counsel at the time. Mother waived any potential conflict, the 
GAL represented. Mother’s briefing does not dispute this. We 
conclude that Mother waived the issue and failed to preserve it 
for appeal. See
 Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 
28(b)(4)(iii). 
24  
 
  
  
  
  
  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Mother’s second argument - the family court erred by 
failing to appoint her new counsel after granting her trial 
counsel’s post-trial motion to withdraw – also lacks merit. 
Mother says that “[h]ypothetically,” she could have litigated 
her first point of error (the GAL’s putative conflict) in a 
motion for reconsideration or new trial. Thus, the family 
court’s failure to appoint her substitute counsel was structural 
error. 
Mother misconstrues structural error. She was never 
without counsel after the trial. On the same day that Mother’s trial counsel moved to withdraw, Mother’s new counsel filed a 
notice of appeal in the ICA. Mother’s trial counsel continued 
as her court-appointed counsel pending the hearing on the motion 
to withdraw. Once the court discharged the trial counsel, it 
did not need to appoint Mother new counsel because she had 
already hired someone. There is no structural error. 
III. 
We vacate the ICA’s September 26, 2023 judgment on appeal 
that vacated orders affecting custody of the children from June 
21, 2019. We affirm the Family Court of the Second Circuit’s 
September 26, 2022 order revoking foster custody, granting 
25

permanent custody of the children to DHS, and ordering the 
permanent plan of adoption by the children’s adult half-sister.
