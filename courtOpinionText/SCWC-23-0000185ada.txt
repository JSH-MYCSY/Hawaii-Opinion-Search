OPINION OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J.  
I. Introduction 
This case presents the issue of whe ther a defendant’s un -
Mirandized statements made in response to a police officer’s 
words “normally attendant to arrest and custody” are admissible 
even when the officer’s statements “were reasonably likely to 
lead to an incriminating response ,” thus constituting

“interrogation” under Article I, Section 10 of the Hawaiʻi State 
Constitution. The answer is no. 
Officer Warren Tavares (“Officer Tavares”) of the Hawaiʻi 
State Department of Land and Natural Resources Division of 
Conservation and Resources Enforcement (“ DLNR DOCARE”) observed 
Randall Hoffman (“Hoffman”) dumping green waste out of a large 
trailer stopped on a Kauaʻi roadside . After some verbal 
exchanges and a scuffle, Hoffman was arrested and charged. 
Before trial, the state filed a motion to determine the 
voluntariness of statements made by Hoffman to Officer Tavares 
during their encounter.1 At the hearing on the motion, Officer 
Tavares testified that he had probable cause to arrest Hoffman 
from the moment he arrived at the scene , that Hoffman was not 
free to leave, but that he did not Mirandize Hoffman at any 
1Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes § 621-26 (2016) provides: 
Confessions, when admissible. No confession shall be 
received in evidence unless it is first made to appear to 
the judge before whom the case is being tried that the 
confession was in fact voluntarily made. 
As we explained in State v. Naititi : 
Although orders suppressing evidence typically result 
from motions to suppress filed by defendants, trial courts 
are authorized to enter such orders when the admissibility 
of a confession is at issue under HRS § 621 -26. Pursuant 
to HRS § 621 -26, the tr ial court must make a determination 
of the voluntariness of a defendant ’s statements, and the 
failure to do so constitutes reversible error.

point. The circuit court suppressed Hoffman’s statements in 
their entirety .2 
The State appealed . The State argued Hoffman’s statement s 
were made in response to Officer Tavares ’s statements or actions 
“normally attendant to arrest and custody” under Hawaiʻi Revised 
Statutes (“HRS”) § 803 -6 (2014)3 and therefore not 
“interrogation.” The Intermediate Court of Appeals (“ICA”) 
issued a summary disposition order (“SDO”) affirming in part and 
vacating in part the circuit court’s order. The ICA ruled that 
certain of Hoffman’s statements made to Officer Tavares’s 
statements were in response to statements “normally attendant to 
arrest and custody” that therefore did not constitute 
“interrogation.” 
On certiorari , Hoffman presents a single question : “Did the 
[ICA] gravely err when it ruled that an officer’s conduct and 
statements ‘normally attendant to arrest and custody’ could not 
arise to an interrogation triggering Miranda warnings?” 
2 The circuit court also excluded Hoffman’s apology to Tavares for a 
separate reason: it had not been provided to the defense by the discovery 
deadline. Neither party disputed the inadmissibility of Hoffman’s apology , 
so it will not be further discussed. 
3 HRS § 803-6 provides in relevant part: 
Arrest, how made. (a) At or before the time of making an 
arrest, the person shall declare that the person is an 
officer of justice, if such is the case. If . . . the 
person makes the arrest without warrant in any of the cases 
in which it is authorized by law, the person should give 
the party arrested clearly to understand for what cause the 
person undertakes to make the arrest . . . . 
3  
  
 
     
  
 
  
 
  
 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
Under Article I, Section 10 of the Hawaiʻi Constitution, a 
statement made by a defendant under “custodial interrogation ” 
without a Miranda warning must be suppressed as 
unconstitutionally elicited. State v. Hewitt, 153 Hawaiʻi 33, 
43, 526 P.3d 558, 568 (2023) . “Custody” is not at issue as the 
State concedes Hoffman was in custody during the entire 
encounter and was not free to leave . At issue is w hether 
Hoffman’s statements were made in response to “interrogation .” 
We hold  that  for Article I, Section 10 purposes, the 
ultimate inquiry is whether a law enforcement  officer knew or 
should have known that their  words or conduct were reasonably 
likely to elicit an incriminating response from the defendant, 
even though the words and conduct might also be “normally 
attendant to arrest and custody.”   See, e.g., State v. Skapinok,
151 Hawaiʻi 170, 173, 510 P.3d 599, 602  (2022) (“There is no per
se exception under the Hawai ʻi Constitution for questions 
‘necessarily “attendant to” [a] legitimate police procedure.’”)   
 
As explained below, we hold that some, but not all, of 
Hoffman’s responses were made in response to words or conduct by 
Officer Tavares that were reasonably likely to lead to an 
incriminating response. Hence, we affirm in part and vacate in 
part the ICA’s judgment on appeal , as well as the circuit 
court’s order suppressi ng all of Hoffman’s statements.

II. Background 
A. Circuit court proceedings 
1. Indictment 
 On December 27, 2021, the State charged Hoffman with one 
count of assault against a law enforcement officer in the first 
degree, in violation of HRS §  707-712.5(1)(a) ; one count of 
resisting arrest, in violation of HRS §  710-1026(1)(a) ; and one 
count of criminal littering, in violation of HRS §  708-829.   654
2. State’s motion to determine voluntariness of the 
defendant’s statements to police and circuit court’s 
ruling 
On March 13, 2023, the State filed a motion to determine 
the voluntariness of Hoffman’s s tatements to Officer Tavares 
4 HRS § 707-712.5 (2014) is titled “Assault against a law enforcement 
officer in the first degree,” and sub -section (1)(a) states, “A person 
commits the offense of assault against a law enforcement officer in the first 
degree if the person . . . [i]ntentionally or knowingly causes bodily injury 
to a law enforcement officer who is engaged in the performance of duty. . . 
.” Assault against a law enforcement officer in the first degree is a class 
C felony. HRS § 707-712.5(2). A person convicted of this offense shall be 
sentenced to (a) an indeterminate term of imprisonment of five years, or (b) 
five years ’ probation (with conditions to include a term of imprisonment of 
not less than 30 days). HRS § 707-712.5(2)(a)&(b). 
5 HRS § 710-1026 (2014) is titled “Resisting arrest,” and sub -section 
(1)(a) states, “A person commits the offense of resisting arrest if the 
person intentionally prevents a law enforcement officer acting under color of 
the law enforcement officer’s official authority from effect ing an arrest by 
. . . [u]sing or threatening to use physical force against the law 
enforcement officer or another. . . .” This crime is a misdemeanor. HRS § 
710-1026(2). 
6 HRS § 708-829 (2014) is titled “Criminal littering” makes it a petty 
misdemeanor for a person to knowingly place, throw, or drop litter on any 
public or private property or waters that is not (a) designated by the 
department of health or the county for disposal of garbage, (b ) a litter 
receptable, or (c) a littler bag that is later disposed of in a designated 
disposal site or litter receptacle.

(“motion”).   Officer Tavares testified at the hearing.   On April 
11, 2023, the circuit court filed its findings of fact  (“FOF”), 
conclusions of law  (“COL”), and order denying the State’s 
motion.   Only certain conclusions of law are at issue on appeal. 
No  findings of fact were contested  by the parties, so we accept 
them as true. Davis  v.  Bissen, 154 Hawaiʻ i  68, 75, 545 P.3d 557, 
564 (2024).   The following findings relate to the statements by 
Hoffman at issue:   7
11. . . . . Officer Tavares pointed to the sign that 
prohibited dumping in that area and told Mr. Hoffman that 
these lands were DLNR [] lands and told Mr. Hoffman to stop 
throwing green waste from the trailer because it was 
illegal. 
12. As a result of Officer Tavares’ statements, Mr. Hoffman 
said “Fuck you, I don’t give a shit.” 
13. Officer Tavares informed Mr. Hoffman that it was 
illegal and they could get cited and arrested for criminal 
littering. Officer Tavares said that the State and 
multiple agencies worked together recently and spent over 
$100,000 cleaning up that area. That it was a high crime 
area, there was a lot of abandoned cars, there was drug 
activity going on and the State and multiple agencies 
worked together and cleaned up that whole area. 
14. Officer Tavares testified that he made those statements 
to Mr. Hoffman to let him know how much work was done to 
clean up the area and to show Mr. Hoffman that it was 
clean. Officer Tavares testified the purpose of his 
statements was to get Mr. Hoffman to stop dumping his green 
waste and to get Mr. Hoffman to pick up the green waste 
that Mr. Hoffman had already dumped on the ground. 
15. Mr. Hoffman responded to Officer Tavares by saying 
“fuck you.” 
16. Mr. Hoffman told Officer Tavares that he was turned 
away from the Hanapepe Refuse Station. Officer Tavares 
continued to explain to Mr. Hoffman that he was dumping 
green waste on the side of the road and that what ever 
problems he had with the county he needed to take up with 
The Honorable Kathleen N.A. Watanabe presided.

 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
the county to see why his trailer was too big. Officer 
Tavares told Mr. Hoffman that was not his jurisdiction 
 . . . . 
18. Mr. Hoffman responded to Officer Tavares by saying 
“fuck you.” 
19. Officer Tavares then went into the trailer to handcuff 
Mr. Hoffman and escorted Mr. Hoffman off of the trailer. 
Mr. Hoffman was able to move his hands that were handcuffed 
in the back of him to the front by placing his legs through 
the opening between the handcuffs and his body. 
20. When Officer Tavares went to his vehicle to get a 
citation book, Mr. Hoffman went back onto the trailer and 
continued to throw green waste from the trailer onto the 
ground. 
21. Officer Tavares went back into the trailer and Officer 
Tavares took Mr. Hoffman to the ground to arrest him. When 
on the ground Mr. Hoffman fell and Officer Tavares was on 
top of Mr. Hoffman. Mr. Hoffman wrapped his legs around 
Officer Tavares and squeezed causing Officer Tavares pain. 
As a result, Officer Tavares punched Mr. Hoffman in the 
facial area. Mr. Hoffman did not respond to Officer 
Tavares. 
22. Officer Tavares punched Mr. Hoffman a second time in 
his facial area and Mr. Hoffman said, “okay, I’m done.” 
Conclusions of law 13, 14, 15, and 18 were contested by the 
State on appeal : 
13. In this case, Officer Tavares engaged in dialogue with 
the Defendant that he should have known would have been 
likely to elicit an incriminating response. Officer 
Tavares testified that the purpose of Officer Tavares’ 
statements to Mr. Hoffman was to get Mr. Hoffman to do 
something, pick up his green waste from the ground. 
Officer Tavares’ statements he made to Mr. Hoffman with 
that purpose went beyond “permissible general on -the-scene 
questioning.” 
14. Based on the totality of circumstances, Mr. Hoffman was 
under custodial interrogation for purposes of Miranda. 
15. Because Mr. Hoffman was subjected to custodial 
interrogation and Officer Tavares did not properly advise 
Mr. Hoffman of his Miranda rights, the prosecution may not 
use the above statements in trial.

18. The State has not met its burden that the evidence 
and/or statements obtained subsequent to Mr. Hoffman’s 
initial un -Mirandized custodial interrogation were not 
obtained or induced as a result of the exploitation of a 
previous illegal act of the police . Therefore, those 
statements may not be used in trial. 
B. ICA proceedings 
The State ’s opening brief raised the following points of 
error:8 
1. The circuit court erred by concluding that Officer 
Tavares subjected [Hoffman] to “interrogation” when Tavares 
told him: (1) to stop engaging in the illegal act of 
criminal littering on DLNR lands (as Tavares pointed to a 
nearby, official sign prohibiting the dumping of green 
waste there); and (2) that the State had recently expende d 
substantial resources to clean up the area. 
 . . . . 
2. The circuit court erred by suppressing from evidence the 
initial statements that [Hoffman] uttered to Officer 
Tavares. 
 On March 1, 2024, the ICA filed a SDO affirming in part, 
and vacating in part, the circuit court’s order.   State v. 
Hoffman, No. CAAP-23-0000185, 2024 WL 889206 (Haw. App. Mar. 1, 
2024) (SDO).   
The ICA agreed with the circuit court that Officer 
Tavares’s statements in FOF 1 3 that the State had spent $100,000 
The State filed its notice of appeal pursuant to HRS § 641-13(7) 
(2016), which provides: 
By State in criminal cases. An appeal may be taken by and 
on behalf of the State from the district or circuit courts 
to the intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 
602, in all criminal matters, in the following instances: 
(7) From a pretrial order granting a motion for the 
suppression of evidence, including a confession or 
admission . . . in which case the appellate court 
shall give priority to the appeal and the order shall 
be stayed pending the outcome of the appeal [.]

 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
to clean up the Lolokai Street area, a high crime area with many 
abandoned cars and drug activity, were reasonably likely to 
elicit an incriminating response from Hoffman . 2024 WL 889206, 
at *2. The ICA thus affirmed the circuit court’s order 
excluding Hoffman’s response in FOF 16 that he had been turned 
away from a county refuse station because his trailer was too 
big. Id. 
The ICA ruled, however, that the remaining statements made 
by Hoffman to Officer Tavares were not interrogation and were, 
instead, voluntary utterances made in response to actio ns or 
statements normally attendant to arrest and custody. Id. 
First, the ICA indicated that Officer Tavares had to inform 
Hoffman why he could be arrested, pursuant to HRS § 803 -6(a), 
which states that an arresting officer, among other things, 
“should give the party arrested clearly to understand for what 
cause the person undertakes to make the arrest .” 2024 WL 
889206, at *1. The ICA characterized Officer Tavares’s actions 
and statements in FOF 11, pointing at the sign prohibiting 
dumping, telling Hoffman that the lands were DLNR lands, and 
telling Hoffman to stop throwing green waste, were normally 
attendant to arrest and custody. Id. The ICA concluded that 
Hoffman’s response of “Fuck you, I don’t give a shit,” in FOF 
12, to be “voluntary utterances, not in response to 
interrogation.” Id. 
9  
  
 
  
    
   
    
 
 
  
    
    
    
  
  
   
  
  
 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
Second, the ICA also characterized Officer Tavares’s 
statement in FOF 13 that Hoffman would be arrested if he 
continued to dump green wast e as a statement normally attend ant 
to arrest and custody. Id. The ICA then ruled Hoffman’s 
response of “Fuck you ,” in FOF 15 , was a voluntary utterance. 
Id. 
Third, the ICA characterized Officer Tavares’s statements 
during the scuffle (“Stop resisting”) as “normally attend ant to 
arrest and custody under the facts of this case.” 2024 WL 
889206, at *2. It ruled Hoffman’s response (“Okay, I’m done”) 
was “not a response to interrogation.” Id. The ICA held the 
circuit court also erred in denying the State’s motion as to 
that statement from Hoffman. Id. 
On April 1, 2024, the ICA issued its judgment on appeal. 
C. Certiorari proceedings 
Hoffman’s certiorari application presents a single 
question: “Did the [ICA] gravely err when it ruled that an 
officer’s conduct and statements ‘normally attendant to arrest 
and custody’ could not arise to an interrogation triggering 
Miranda warnings ?” 
III. Standards of Review 
A. Motion to suppress 
“An appellate court reviews a ruling on a motion to 
suppress de novo to determine whether the ruling was ‘right’ or 
10  
  
 
  
 
  
   ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
‘wrong.’” Hewitt, 153 Hawai‘i at 40, 526 P.3d at 565 (citation s 
omitted). 
B. Constitutional issues 
“Questions of constitutional law are reviewed under the 
right/wrong standard. ” State v. Borge , 152 Hawaiʻi 458, 464, 526 
P.3d 435, 441 (2023) (citation omitted). 
IV. Discussion 
A. Summary of applicable law 
The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Article I, 
Section 10 of the Hawaiʻi Constitution guarantee the right 
against self-incrimination. Hewitt, 153 Hawaiʻ i at  43, 526 P.3d 
at  568. The Fifth Amendment states, “No person . . . shall be 
compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself. 
. . .” Article I, section 10 of the Hawai ʻi Constitution states, 
“No person shall . . . be compelled in any criminal case to be a 
witness against oneself.”   “Miranda  warnings help safeguard this 
right.” Hewitt, 153 Hawai ʻi at 43, 526 P.3d at 568.   As a matter 
of state constitutionalism, this court “provide[s] criminal 
defendants with greater protection under Hawai ʻi’s version of the 
privilege against self-incrimination . . . than is otherwise 
ensured by the federal courts under Miranda  and its progeny.” 
Hewitt, 153 Hawai ʻi at 44, 526 P.3d at 569  (citation omitted).  
11  
  
 
 
 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
Under the Hawaiʻi Constitution, “[a]bsent Miranda warnings 
and a valid waiver of them, statements obtained from a person 
subjected to uncounseled custodial interrogation are 
inadmissible in a subsequent criminal proceeding brought against 
that person.” State v. Ah Loo, 94 Hawaiʻi 207, 210, 10 P.3d 728, 
731 (2000). A “custodial interrogation” consists of 
questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a 
person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of 
their freedom of action in any significant way. In other 
words, the defendant, objecting to the admissibility of 
their statement and, thus, seeking to suppress it, must 
establish that their statement was the result of (1) “interrogation” that occurred while they were (2) “in 
custody.”  
Hewitt, 153 Hawaiʻi at 43, 526 P.3d at 568 (cleaned up).  
In this case, no party disputes that Hoffman was in custody 
when Officer Tavares approached him and started talking to him. 
What is at issue is whether Tavares’s words or conduct directed 
at Hoffman constituted interrogation.  
In State v. Paahana, for purposes of the Hawaiʻi 
Constitution, this court adopted the interrogation test in Rhode 
Island v. Innis, 446 U.S. 291 (1980): “In determining whether an 
officer’s questions constitute interrogation, the test is 
whether the officer should have known that his words and actions 
were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from 
the defendant.” 66  Haw. 499, 503, 666 P.2d 592, 595-96 (1983).  
In State v. Ketchum , 97 Hawaiʻi 107, 119-20, 34 P.3d 1006 , 
1018-19 (2001), this court declined , as a matter of state 
12  
  
 
 
  
   
 
 
 
   
 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
constitutional law, to recognize a federal “carve out” to the 
Innis interrogation inquiry: the “routine booking question 
exception .” “Routine booking questions” “elicit[] general 
biographical data necessary for purposes of booking and pretrial 
services.” Id. This court noted that, “in the vast majority of 
cases,” routine booking questions are not “reasonably likely to 
elicit incriminating responses.” Id. 
In Ketchum, however, the police asked a suspect (Ketchum) a 
would-be “routine booking question” about his residence address. 
97 Hawaiʻi at 112, 34 P.3d at 101 1. We held that the “routine 
booking question” was nevertheless reasonably likely to elicit 
an incriminating response under the circumstances ; therefore, 
Ketchum was interrogated for Miranda purposes . 97 Hawaiʻi at 
127, 34 P.3d at 1026. This was because the police raided a home 
pursuant to a search warrant and located Ketchum, drugs , and the 
known occupant of the home in the bedroom. 97 Hawai ʻi at 112, 34 
P.3d at 1011. Although the first police officer asking Ketchum 
for his residence address testified that “obtaining such 
personal information was ‘normal procedure,’” the police officer 
also acknowledged that “establishing Ketchum’s address as the 
same as that where drug contraband was found would assist in 
prosecuting him for constructi ve possession of any drug 
contraband subsequently discovered in the residence.” Id. We 
also held the residence address question posed by other police 
13  
  
 
   
  
 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
officers constituted interrogation . 97 Hawai ʻi at 128 -29, 34 
P.3d at 1027 -28. 
In declining on state constitutional grounds to recognize 
the “routine booking question” exception to Innis’s 
interrogation test, we stated: 
Thus, to the extent that, under article I, section 10, the 
ultimate question regarding “interrogation” is whether the questioning officer knew or reasonably should have known 
that his or her question was likely to elicit an 
incriminating response, the fact  that a question is in the 
nature of a “routine booking question” is merely one consideration among many relevant to an assessment of the totality of the circumstances. In other words, the 
“routine booking question exception” does no more than 
recognize t hat not every “express question” constitutes 
“interrogation.”  
Ketchum, 97 Hawaiʻi at 120, 34 P.3d at 1019 (citations and 
footnote omitted).  
State v. Kazanas, 138 Hawaiʻi 23, 35, 375 P.3d 1261, 1273 
(2016) later clarified that “determining whether ‘interrogation’ 
has taken place is not measured by the ‘totality of the 
circumstances,’ as Ketchum  held; rather, ‘interrogation’ occurs 
when police know or should know that their words or actions are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the 
suspect, as Innis  held.” Nevertheless, Kazanas  reaffirmed that 
the “touchstone  in analyzing whether ‘interrogation’ has taken 
place is whether the police officer ‘should have known that [their] words and actions were reasonably likely to elicit an 
incriminating response from the defendant.’” 138 Hawai ʻi at 38, 
14  
  
 
 
   
 
     
 
    ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
375 P.3d at 1276 (citing Paahana, 66 Haw. at 503, 666 P.2d at 
595-96 (citing Innis, 446 U.S. at 301)) (emphasis added). 
The use of the Paahana/Innis “interrogation” test continued 
through this court’s decision in State v. Trinque, where we 
stated, “‘ interrogation ’ under [our state ] Miranda [rule] refers 
to (1) any words, actions, or practice on the part of the 
police, not only express questioning, (2) o ther than those 
normally attendant to arrest and custody , and (3) that the 
police should know is reasonably likely to invoke an 
incriminating response .” 140 Hawaiʻi 269, 277, 400 P.3d 470, 478 
(2017). In Trinque, police officers received information that 
marijuana was growing in a 25 -acre pasture. 140 Hawaiʻi at 272, 
400 P.3d at 473. Police conducted nighttime su rveillance of the 
pasture and encounter ed Trinque and a nother individual. Id. 
One of the police officers identified himself as Lieutenant 
Rosa and informed Trinque that he knew of Trinque because he had 
assisted Trinque’s daughter with her case when she  was worried 
about people who might have intended to assault Trinque. 140 
Hawaiʻi  at 273, 273 n.2, 400 P.3d at 474, 474 n.2.  Lieutenant 
Rosa told Trinque “he would not lie to him,”  “he would not ‘jerk 
his chain,’” and that “he would be completely honest with him.” 
140 Hawaiʻ i  at 273, 400 P.3d at 474. Lieutenant Rosa then 
advised  Trinque not to make any statements until they got back 
to Lihue and Trinque could be advised of his rights. Id.   
15  
  
  
   
 
  
 
 
 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
Trinque had not been advised of his Miranda rights at this time. 
Id. Trinque then stated, “What for? You caught us red handed, 
there’s nothing left to say, times are hard and we needed the 
money.” Id. The circuit court suppressed this statement, 
among others, and the State appealed. 140 Hawaiʻi at 275, 400 
P.3d at 476. This court affirmed the circuit court, holding 
that Lieutenant Rosa’s statements elicited the statement from 
Trinque that w as “the product of pre -Miranda custodial 
interrogation” and therefore inadmissible. 140 Hawaiʻi at 284, 
400 P.3d at 485. 
As to Lieutenant Rosa’s statements, the Trinque  court held, 
“While Lt. Rosa’s introduction of himself to Trinque as a police 
officer may have been normal procedure that typically attends 
arrests, all of the other words and actions that Lt. Rosa 
directed to Trinque cannot be characterized as anything other 
than an attempt to erode Trinque’s guard so that Trinque would 
freely talk in a manner that would incriminate himself.” 140 
Hawaiʻi  at 278, 400 P.3d at 479  (emphases added).   Thus, contrary 
to the State’s  argument, even if a police officer’s statement  is 
“normally attendant to arrest and custody ,”  Article I, Section 
10 still requires a court to analyze whether the statement  was 
reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response to  
determine  whether a defendant was interrogated for Miranda  
purposes. There is no “carve out” or “exception” to the 
16  
  
 
  
 
 
 
  
 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
interrogation inquiry for statements “normally attend ant to 
arrest and custody.” 
Finally, Skapinok  puts to rest any argument that police 
statements “normally attendant to arrest and custody” are an 
actual exception to the “interrogation” test. In that case, we  
held  that “medical rule -out questions” that police ask during 
traffic stops on suspicion of operating a vehicle under the 
influence of an intoxicant (“O VUII”) are not exempted from the 
Miranda  interrogation inquiry. 151 Hawaiʻi at 172, 510 P.3d at 
601. More to the point, this court held,  
There is no per se exception under the Hawai ʻi Constitution 
for questions “necessarily ‘ attendant to ’  [a] legitimate 
police procedure. ”   To avoid suppression for want of 
Miranda  warnings, such questions must pass muster under our 
well-established interrogation test: “whether the officer 
should have known that his words and actions were 
reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from 
the defendant. ”   
151 Hawaiʻi at 173, 510 P.3d at 602 (citing Paahana, 66 Haw. at 
503, 666 P.2d at 595 -96). 
In Skapinok, a police officer pulled over a suspect 
(Skapinok) on suspicion of reckless driving, then developed a 
reasonable suspicion that Skapinok was committing OVUII as well. 
151 Hawaiʻi at 173, 510 P.3d at 602. A police corporal arrived 
and asked Skapinok the “medical rule -out questions” prior to 
administering standard field sobriety tests:  
i. Do you have any physical defects or speech impediments? 
ii. Are you taking any medications? 
iii. Are you under the care of a doctor or dentist for 
anything? 
17  
  
 
 
 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
iv. Are you under the care of an eye doctor? 
v. Do you have an artificial or glass eye ? 
vi. Are you epileptic or diabetic? 
vii. Are you blind in either eye?  
151 Hawaiʻi at 173-74, 177, 510 P.3d at 602-03, 605. Neither 
police officer advised Skapinok of her Miranda  rights at  the 
scene. 151 Hawai ʻi at 174, 510 P.3d at 603. The district court 
suppressed all of Skapinok’s answers to these questions as 
violative of her Hawaiʻi constitutional right against self-
incrimination, and the State appealed. 151 Hawaiʻ i at 177-78, 
510 P.3d at 606-07.   
18  The ICA held that  the medical rule-out questions were 
reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response and, 
therefore, constituted interrogation. 151 Hawaiʻi at 178, 510 
P.3d at 607.   This court affirmed that conclusion. 151 Hawai ʻi 
at 179, 510 P.3d at 608.   Rather than alter the test set forth 
in Trinque  (as the State contends),  this court cited  it: 
“‘[I]nterrogation under Miranda  refers to (1) any words, 
actions, or practice on the part of the police, not only express 
questioning, (2) other than those normally attendant to arrest 
and custody, and (3) that the police should know is reasonably 
likely to invoke an incriminating response.”   151 Hawai ʻi at 180, 
510 P.3d at 609 (citing Trinque, 140 Hawai ʻi at 277, 400 P.3d at 
478).   
  Skapinok  clarified that there is no absolute carve-out for 
police procedures normally attendant to arrest and custody. 
Rather, Skapinok  articulated that the second Trinque  factor is 
still subject to an analysis under the third Trinque  factor. 
Specifically, this court noted, “While we have explicitly 
recognized the ‘attendant to arrest and custody’ carve -out to 
the definition of ‘interrogation,’ Hawaiʻi law points against 
eliminating the ‘incriminating response’ inquiry even when the 
police ask questions ‘attendant to’ a routine, legitimate 
procedure.” Skapinok, 151 Hawaiʻ i at 182, 510 P.3d at 611 
(citing Trinque, 140 Hawai ʻi at 277, 400 P.3d at 478).  This 
court elaborated, “[W]e see no reason to treat questions 
‘attendant to’ police procedures differently than ‘booking 
questions’ under the Hawai ʻi Constitution –  the inquiry in both 
circumstances is whether the question is reasonably likely to 
elicit an incriminating response.”  151 Hawaiʻ i at 183, 510 P.3d 
at 612. “In other words, being attendant to a police pro cedure, 
standing alone, does not obviate the need to examine whether the 
officer knew or should have known that the questions were 
reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.” Id.    
 
  ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
The State finds significance in the difference in 
Skapinok ’s phraseology between questions “‘attendant to’ police 
procedures” and questions “normally attendant to arrest and 
custody” to argue that Skapinok did not, in fact, hold that 
19  
  
  
 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
questions “normally attendant to arrest and custody” are 
nevertheless subject to an analysis into whether the police 
officer knew or should have known that their words or conduct 
would be reasonable likely to elicit an incriminating response.   
In looking at the root of the phrase “attendant to police procedures” that Skapinok  drew from  Pennsylvania v. Muniz, 496 
U.S. 582 (1990), it is clear that the United States Supreme 
Court was interpreting Innis’s “normally attendant to arrest and 
custody” concept. The  Muniz  court used the phrase “attendant 
to” a “legitimate  police procedure” for this concept and cited 
to South Dakota v. Neville, 459 U.S. 553, 564 n.15 (1983). 496 
U.S. at 605. Footnote 15 in Neville, in turn, cited  directly to 
Innis  for the “normally attendant to arrest and custody” prong 
of the interrogation test. 459 U.S. at 564 n.15. Therefore, as 
Hoffman argues, an unbroken chain of 
Hawaiʻi appellate precedent 
holds that, under the Hawai ʻi Constitution,  police questions 
“normally attendant to arrest and custody” are still subject to 
the touchstone  inquiry into whether those questions were 
reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.   
B. Application of law to each of Hoffman’s remaining 
statements at issue 
20  The State did not file an application for certiorari, so  
the ICA’s affirmance of the circuit court’s  suppression of 
Hoffman’s response in FOF 16 that he had been turned away from a  
  
  
    
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
county refuse station because his trailer was too big is not at 
issue. We now apply the principles of law above to each of the 
remaining statements at issue. 
1. FOFs 11 & 12: first “Fuck you, I don’t give a shit ” 
Officer Tavares testified that when he initially engaged 
Hoffman by pointing to the littering sign and stat ed that what 
Hoffman was doing was illegal, Hoffman responded, “Fuck you, I 
don’t give a shit.” The ICA rul ed that Officer Tavares’s 
statement was normally attendant to arrest and custody and that 
Hoffman’s initial statement was a voluntary utterance. The ICA 
erred in two ways: (1) factually, because Officer Tavares’s own 
uncontroverted testimony was that he was not in the process of 
arresting Hoffman; and (2) legally, because it applied the wrong 
standard . As noted, Officer Tavares’s words and conduct must be 
analyzed for whether they were reasonably likely to elicit an 
incriminating response. 
Despite the ICA’s error, Officer Tavares pointing to the 
sign and informing Hoffman that what he was doing was illegal 
did not constitute words or conduct reasonably likely to elicit 
an incriminating response. “Criminal littering” under HRS § 
708-829 requires the State to prove that a defendant acted 
“knowingly.” It is not reasonably likely that a person being 
informed that he was dumping items in a prohibited area would 
admit to such a state of mind by making an incriminating 
21  
    
 
 
 
 
  
  
   ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
statement like “Fuck you, I don’t give a shit.”  Thus, although 
the ICA applied the incorrect legal standard, we hold that 
Hoffman’s first statement was not in response to words or 
conduct of Officer Tavares that was likely to elicit an 
incriminating response.  
2. FOFs 13-15, second “fuck you”9 
The ICA affirmed the circuit court’s ruling that Officer 
Tavares’s statements in FOF 13 were reasonably likely to elicit 
an incriminating response from Hoffman and that, therefore, 
Hoffman’s response in FOF 16, that he had been turned away from 
a county ref use station , was properly suppressed. Yet, because 
Officer Tavares had said what Hoffman was doing was illegal and 
that he could get cited and arrested for criminal littering at 
the beginning of this statement in FOF 13, the ICA determined 
that Hoffmans’ second “fuck you,” which preceded his statement 
in FOF 16 that the ICA ruled was properly suppressed , was in 
response to a statement normally attendant to arrest and also a 
voluntary utterance. 
First, Officer Taveres’s statement that what Hoffman was 
doing was illegal and that he could get cited and arrested was not  a statement normally attendant to arrest  as  Officer Tavares 
was not placing Hoffman under arrest  and had no intention of 
The ICA refers to this as the third “fuck you.” The ICA SDO says it 
was supplementing the circuit court’s FOFs with Officer Tavares’s testimony. 
Hoffman, 2024 WL 889206, at *1. But the unchallenged FOFs control. 
22 9  
  
 
  
  
 
 
 
  
 
     ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
arresting Hoffman at that point in time . In any event, the ICA 
again applied the wrong standard; the proper standard is whether 
the officer’s words were reasonably likely to lead to an 
incriminating response. J ust as Hoffman’s response that 
followed in FOF 16 was in response to statement s from Officer 
Tavares in FOF 13 likely to elicit an incriminating response, so 
was his “fuck you” in FOF 15 that began the explanation the ICA 
determined was properly suppressed in FOF 16 , especially after 
he had already incriminated himself with the first “Fuck you, I 
don’t give a shit.” 
3. FOFs 16 & 18, third “fuck you”10 
The ICA does not specifically refer to this third “fuck 
you.” Its ruling does not vacate the circuit court’s ruling 
regarding FOF 16 and 18. In any event, Officer Tavares’s 
statements in FOF 16 were also reasonably likely to lead to an 
incriminating response such that Hoffman’s statement in FOF 18 
should be suppressed. 
4. FOFs 21-22, “okay I’m done” 
The ICA determined Officer Tavares’s actions in 
effectuating the arrest and statement “stop resisting” during 
the scuffle were normally attendant to arrest and custody and 
that Hoffman’s response, “okay, I’m done” was not in response to 
10See supra note 9. 
23   
     
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
interrogation.  As explained above, HRS § 803-6 does not alter 
the “interrogation” test ,  and to avoid suppression for want of 
Miranda  warnings, statements and actions are analyzed for 
whether the officer should have known that his words and actions 
were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from 
the defendant.  
Officer’s Tavares’s words were a command to Hoffman to 
“stop resisting” and to stop exerting physical force against the 
officer, and were not words reasonably likely to elicit an 
incriminating response. Thus, the ICA did not err by overruling 
the circuit court’s suppression of this statement. 
V. Conclusion 
For these reasons, we vacate the ICA April 1, 2024 judgment 
on appeal as well as the circuit court’s April 11, 20 23 
“Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying State 
of Hawaii ’s Motion to Determine Voluntariness of Defendant's 
Statements to Police, ” and remand this case to the circuit court 
for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
