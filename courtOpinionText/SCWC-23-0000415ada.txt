CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS  
(CAAP-23-0000415; CIVIL NO. 1CCV-22-0000828)  
MARCH 4, 2025  
I. Introduction 
This case concerns whether an appeal improperly filed in 
the Environmental Court of the First Circuit (“environmental 
court”) can and should be transferred to this court . 
On July 15, 2022, Michael Dailey a nd Elizabeth Dailey 
(together, “the Dail eys”), son and mother, filed an appeal with 
1  
   
  
   
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
   
    
 
 
  ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
the environmental court . The appeal was from a 2022 Board of 
Land and Natural Resources (“BLNR”) contested case decision 
regarding a seawall allegedly constructed makai1 of the shoreline 
and within the conservation district. After the Dail eys filed 
their opening brief, the BLNR raised appellate jurisdiction 
issues in its answering brief. The BLNR pointed out that Act 48 
of 2016 (“Act 48”) had amended the law to require the Daileys’ 
appeal to be filed directly with this cou rt. 
Specifically, s ection 2 of Act 48 added a new statute, 
Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (“HRS”) § 183C -9 (Supp. 2016) . 
Subsection (a) provides that “a ny contested case under this 
chapter shall be appealed from a final decision and order . . . 
upon the record directly to the supreme court for final 
decision, except for those appeals heard pursuant to this 
chapter arising in whole or in part from part III of chapter 
205A . . . .”2 HRS Chapter 183C concerns the conservation 
district. Part III of HRS Chapter 205A concerns shoreline 
setbacks . 
1 “Makai” means “on the seaside, toward the sea, in the direction of the 
sea.” Kai, Mary Kawena Pukui & Samuel H. Elbert, Hawaiian Dictionary (6th 
ed. 1987). 
2   Act 48 was effective from August 1, 2016 to June 30, 2019. 2016 Haw. 
Sess. Laws Act 48, at 82.   Act 213 of 2019 made HRS §  183C-9 a permanent 
statute.   2019 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 213, at 637.

 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
BLNR then filed a motion to dismiss alleging lack of 
appellate jurisdiction. The Daileys argued the environmental 
court had jurisdiction, but they also asked the environmental 
court to transfer the appeal to this court if it de termined it 
lacked appellate jurisdiction . The environmental court 
dismissed the appeal based on a lack of appellate jurisdictio n 
and ruled it lacked power to transfer the appeal to this court . 3 
The Intermediate Court of Appeals (“ICA”) affirme d. 4 
On certiorari, the Daileys raise two issues: 
1. Whether the I CA gravely erred in affirming the 
environmental court’s dismissal of the Daileys’ contested 
case appeal by incorrectly finding that the HRS Chapter 
205A shoreline setback exception in HRS § 183C -9 did not 
apply. Answering this question in the affirmativ e 
would obviate the need to address the second question. 
2. If the I CA did not err in affirming the finding 
above, the question becomes whether the ICA gravely erred 
in affirming the environmental court’s Conclusion of Law 
denying a direct transfer request to the Hawaiʻi Supreme 
Court for lack [of] authority for such a transfer. 
On the first issue, as further explained below, we hold 
that the Daileys’ appeal does not involve the HRS Chapter 205A 
shoreline setback exception in HRS § 183C -9; therefore, this 
court has exclusive appellate jurisdiction . 
3 The Honorable Jeffrey P. Crabtree presided. 
4 During the pendency of the ICA appeal, Elizabeth Dailey passed away. 
Michael Dailey asked that the appeal proceed in his name as the remaining 
appellant.

   ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
On the second issue, we need not decide whether the ICA 
erred by affirming the environmental court’s dismissal. The 
power of our courts to transfer appeals was not clear when the 
environmental court and the ICA issued their rulings. Even 
absent error, this court has discretion under HRS § 602 -59(a) 
(2016) to accept certiorari. See State v. Hussein , 122 Hawaiʻi 
495, 514, 229 P.3d 313, 332 (2010). Here, we accepted 
certiorari to consider whether the Daileys’ appeal should be 
transferred to this court based on our holdings in Honoipu 
Hideaway , LLC v. Land Use Commission , 154 Hawaiʻi 372, 550 P.3d 
1230 (2024), and Rosehill v. Land Use Commission , 155 Hawaiʻi 41, 
556 P.3d 387 (2024). These opinions post -dated the ICA’s May 
16, 2024 summary disposition order (“SDO”). 
Honoipu and Rosehill addressed appeals filed in circuit 
courts from Land Use Commission (“LUC”) declaratory orders ; the 
appeals were filed before our opinion in In re Kanahele , 152 
Hawaiʻi 501, 526 P.3d 47 8 (2023). In Kanahele , we held that LUC 
declaratory orders have the same status for judicial review as 
contested case orders. 152 Hawaiʻi at 512, 526 P.3d at 489. As 
a result, based on amendments to appellate jurisdiction in Act 
48, appeal s from LUC declaratory order s were also required to be 
filed directly with this court. 152 Hawaiʻi at 511-12, 526 P.3d 
488-89.

 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
After Kanahele , in Honoipu, a reserved question case, we 
held that a circuit court has inherent and statutory authority 
to transfer a timely-filed appeal nunc pro tunc to this court. 
154 Hawaiʻi at 374, 550 P.3 at 1232.  Then, in Rosehill , after 
accepting transfer of an appeal to the ICA, we deemed the 
transfer accepted nunc pro tunc to the date the appeal was 
originally filed in the circuit court. 155 Hawaiʻi at 45, 556 
P.3d at 391. 
Both Honoipu and Rosehill limited their holdings regarding 
appellate jurisdiction to the “limited circumstances” of those 
cases, where appeals of LUC declar atory orders were pending in 
lower courts when Kanahele was published. Honoipu, 154 Hawaiʻi 
at 374, 550 P.3d at 1232; Rosehill , 155 Hawaiʻi at 50, 556 P.3d 
at 396. But, as noted in Honoipu, our appellate courts have 
long adhered to the policy of permitting litigants, where 
possible, to appeal and to have their cases heard on the merits. 
Honoipu, 154 Hawaiʻi at 376, 550 P.3d at 1234 (citation omitted). 
And, as further noted in Honoipu, various other jurisdictions 
have held that courts have inherent authority to transfer 
appeals when they have been filed in the wrong court . See 
Honoipu, 154 Hawaiʻi at 376, 376 n.3, 550 P.3d at 1234 , 1234 n.3. 
The inherent and statutory power of our lower and appellate 
courts to order transfer s of appeals to the court with appellate 
jurisdiction, as well as our policy of permitting litigants ,

 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
where possible, to appeal and to have their cases heard on the 
merits, also applies here. Not allowing a transfer would 
preclude a decision on the merits of the Da ileys’ appeal. 
Hence, w e hold that , based on the inherent and statutory 
bases provid ing courts with the power to order transfer s of 
appeals to the court with appellate jurisdiction , the 
environmental court had the power to transfer the Daileys’ 
appeal to this court . Under the circumstances of this case, w e 
order the environmental court to transfer the appeal to this 
court nunc pro tunc to the date of its July 15, 2022 filing as 
soon as this court’s judgment on appeal has entered . The appeal 
on the merits is then to proceed in this court pursuant to the 
Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure (“HRAP”), with deadlines to 
correspond with the date the appeal is actually transferred to 
this court. 
II. Background 
A. Factual background 
The Dailey family has owned an ocean -front residential 
property in Mokuleia , on the North Shore of Oʻahu, for decades. 
The late Fred Dailey , husband of Elizabeth and father of 
Michael, was also a previous owner. In December of 1969, Hawai ʻi 
was hit with a swell that brought waves that caused destruction 
to homes along the North Shore, including the Daile y property . 
In what was likely early 1970, Fred Dailey constructed a large, 
6  
   
 
  
   
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
  
 
 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
loose rock revetment on the makai side of the property to 
protect the land and home from high surf damage and beach 
erosion. 
The structure lasted for decades, but in the early 2000s, 
members of the public began complaining to the Department of 
Land and Natural Resources (“DLNR”) that the deteriorating 
revetment was sending boulders rolling down onto the beach. It 
appears that by th en the beach had eroded and the rock pile 
revetment was below the highest wash of the waves and within the 
conservation district . 5 The DLNR found that rocks from the 
revetment were being worn down by surf and were rolling onto the 
beach. DLNR’s Office of Conservation and Coastal Lands (“OCCL”) 
issued a notice indicating it had no record of ever approving 
the structure and recommend ed its removal. 
Instead of removing the revetment , around 2006 to 2007, 
without obtaining a permit, the Daileys built a new seawall with 
a cement cap on top of the 1970 rock pile. The OCCL then 
recommended that BLNR fine the Daileys and order them to remove 
the structure. BLNR agreed with the recommendation, and the 
Daileys sought a contested case hearing. 
The “conservation district” is defined as “those lands within the 
various counties of the State bounded by the conservation district line. . . 
.” HRS § 183C-2 (2023). In this case, it means the lands makai of the 
shoreline.

    ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
B. Procedural background before this appeal 
This is the third judicial appeal regarding th is matter. 
1. First appeal and remand 
On June 13, 2014, BLNR issued a decision and order finding 
the seawall violated permissible uses within the conservation 
district and fined the Daileys. The Daileys appealed this 
decision to the circuit court . On March 20, 2015, the circuit 
court remanded the matter to the BLNR for the BLNR to prove the 
original rock pile revetment was built within the conservation 
district. This remand order was not further appealed. 
On remand, on June 23, 2017, the BLNR determined that the 
OCCL had not met its burden, but also determined that 
construction of the new seawall constituted a violation. 
2. Second appeal and remand 
On July 21, 2017, the Daileys filed their second appeal, 
this time with the environmental court. 6 Although this appeal 
was filed after the August 1, 2016 effective date of Act 48, the 
BLNR did not contest the environmental court’s appellate 
jurisdiction. In this second appeal, t he environmental court 
concluded there were procedural infirmities, vacated the BLNR 
HRS Chapter 60 4A (2016), which created our environmental courts, came 
into effect on July 1, 2015. 2016 Haw. Sess. Laws. Act 218, at 737 -39. 
Pursuant to HRS § 604A-2(a)(1) (2016 & Supp. 2018 ), from that date, the 
environmental court had exclusive jurisdiction of administrative appeals 
arising out of HRS title 12, which includes HRS Chapter 183.

   ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
decision, and remanded for a contested case hearing that is the 
subject of this third appeal. This decision was also not 
further appealed. 
3. BLNR decision 
After the subject contested case hearing, the BLNR issued 
its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and decision and order 
on June 16, 2022 (“BLNR FOF/COL” ). The BLNR noted issues 
regarding pinning down the location of the shoreline for 
purposes of this case. BLNR had not established the location 
and boundaries of the shoreline when Fred Dailey built the 
original rock pile revetment; therefore, BLNR was n ot able to 
establish that the original rock pile revetment was built makai 
of the shoreline and in the conservation district. As such, 
BLNR consider ed the original rock pile revetment to be a 
“nonconforming” (once legal) structure. 
By the early 2000s, however, due to beach erosion, the 
highest wash of the waves was clearly above the deteriorating 
revetment. BLNR noted that the Daileys ’ first attempt to 
certify their shoreline in 2007 was rejected because they tried 
to certify the shoreline against the face of the ir new seawall. 
Based on the Daileys’ second request, however, on September 15, 
2011, DLNR certified the shoreline mauka7 of the seawall , which 
“Mauka” means “inland.” Mauka, Mary Kawena Pukui & Samuel H. Elbert, 
Hawaiian Dictionary (6th ed. 1987). 
9 7  
   
 
    
  
  
 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
meant the seawall was within the conservation district. 
Although the Daileys later complained about the location of the 
certified shoreline, they neither appealed the certification n or 
sought a new certification. 
The BLNR then concluded  that the Daileys “willfully 
violated H.R.S. § 183C-4(b), and H.A.R. §§ 13-5-30(b)(1994), 13-
5-22(P-9)(C-1)(1994), 13-5-23(L-5)(D-1)(1994), and 13-5-
37(e)(1994) by demolishing a nonconforming rock pile and 
reconstructing it into an unauthorized and unpermitted seawall 
in the Conservation District on or about December of 2006 
through February of 2007.”   The BLNR determined  that the seawall 
and remnants of the rock pile have persisted as a continuing violation since that time.   BLNR also concluded that the seawall 
construction exceeded what could lawfully be done on a nonconforming structure without permits.   BLNR fined the Daileys 
$8000 and ordered them  to remove the unauthorized seawall, all 
rocks makai of and underlying the seawall, and any remaining sections of the old rock pile.   
BLNR determined that r egardless of where the shoreline had 
originally been , the Daileys had gone well beyond what would 
constitute legal repairs to the nonconforming rock pile 
revetment by cementing it over and buil ding a seawall on top of 
it. The BLNR concluded that the seawall violated HRS chapter 
183C and its relevant administrative rules because it could not 
10  
   C. Appeal to the environmental court  
  1. Appeal 
 
On July 15, 2022, the Daileys filed a notice of appeal of 
the BLNR’s FOF/COL with  the circuit court.   They cited HRS §§ 
91-14 and 183C-8 as the statutory bases for their appeal.   They 
quoted a 1994 version of HRS § 183C-8 as stating, “Any final 
order of the department based upon this chapter may be appealed 
to the circuit court of the circuit in which the land in 
question is found. The appeal shall be in accord with chapter 
91 and the Hawaii rules of civil procedure.”   The circuit court 
later appropriately redesignated the matter as being in the 
environmental court.     8
 In its  answer to the Daileys’  statement of the case, the 
BLNR raised as a defense the environmental  court’s lack of 
subject matter jurisdiction over the Daileys’ appeal.   The DLNR 
filed a joinder.  
 
 
 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
have been built in the conservation district without a permit 
and would not have been considered a legal repair of a 
nonconforming structure even if it remained in the shoreline 
setback area.   
11 8   See  supra  note  6.   
  
   2. Briefing before the environmental court 
 
    a. Daileys’ opening brief 
 
The Daileys’ October 17, 2022 opening brief addressed the 
merits of the BLNR’s FOF/COL  in addition to appellate 
jurisdiction.   Because this certiorari proceeding deals only 
with appellate jurisdiction, we do not discuss the briefing  
except as relevant to appellate jurisdiction  issues that 
continue to be raised on certiorari.  
 Regarding appellate jurisdiction, the Daileys pointed out a 
“jurisdictional split” between the City and County of Honolulu 
(“the City”) and the DLNR along the shoreline.   They explained 
that land mauka of the shoreline is within City  jurisdiction 
under HRS chapter 205A  while land makai of the shoreline is 
under DLNR jurisdiction under HRS Chapter 183.     
    b. BLNR’s answering brief 
 In its answering brief, which DLNR joined,  BLNR raised  the 
threshold question of whether the  environmental court had  
jurisdiction to hear the Daileys’ appeal.   BLNR pointed out that 
the Daileys cited an outdated statute  for their appeal;  HRS § 
183C-8  had provided  that conservation district contested case 
proceeding appeals would be heard by the circuit court.   BLNR 
noted, however,  that Act 48 had vested appellate jurisdiction ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
12  
      c. Daileys’ reply brief  ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
over HRS chapter 183C  contested case appeals directly with this 
court.    
BLNR acknowledged  that the  environmental  court still 
retained  jurisdiction over appeals concerning  HRS Chapter 205A 
Part III.   BLNR asserted, however,  that the Daileys’ case did 
not involve such issues  and concerned only a seawall constructed 
makai of the shoreline, wholly within the conservation district.   
BLNR noted that the Daileys themselves, in their notice of 
appeal, did not cite to HRS Chapter  205A Part III.    
BLNR acknowledged that  there had been counts  related to HRS 
Chapter 205A Part III brought against the Daileys in a prior 
contested case hearing, but noted that those counts had been 
dismissed and no such claims had since been included.   BLNR 
notified the environmental court that it would be preparing a separate motion to dismiss the Daileys’ appeal.    
In their reply brief, the Daileys pointed out that even 
after the enactment of Act 48, their 2017 (second) appeal  had 
been to the environmental court. The Daileys noted  that the 
BLNR did not contest  appellate jurisdiction, which the 
environmental court purported to exercise.   The Daileys also 
argued that their  appeal noted the jurisdictional split between 
the  City  and the BLNR  and asserted that their appeal involved 
HRS chapter 205A Part III.  
13 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
14 The Daileys alternatively asked the environmental court to 
transfer their appeal to this court in the even t it ruled it 
lacked appellate jurisdiction.     
3.   BLNR’s motion to dismiss 
  
 a. BLNR’s motion  
 
 BLNR then filed a motion to dismiss on November 22, 2022,  
which DLNR joined.   BLNR elaborated  on its position  that there 
were no shoreline setback issues under HRS Chapter 205A Part III 
at issue in the instant appeal.   BLNR explained that DLNR staff 
had initially alleged HRS §§ 205A -43.6 and -44(b) violation s; 
BLNR dismissed that claim, however,  because the City was the 
entity with jurisdiction over enforcement of HRS Chapter 205A 
shoreline setback statutes.   According to BLNR, no further 
allegations regarding the shoreline setback area were made.     
BLNR also pointed out that the shoreline determination for 
the subject property was made in 2011, when the shoreline was 
certified as mauka of the Daileys’ rock revetment .  The Daileys 
had not appeal ed this determination.   BLNR emphasized that , in 
any event,  the current appeal concerned an interpretation of 
nonconforming uses in the conservation district  and did not 
involve shoreline setback  issues.    
 b. Dailey’s memorandum in opposition    
 In opposition, t he Daileys argued that their appeal 
triggers the HRS Chapter 205A Part III ex ception of HRS § 183C -** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
15 9(a) because, over the course of fifteen years , the parties ha d 
argued over the location of the shoreline in reference to the 
revetment.   They asserted that the movement of the shoreline in 
the mauka direction gave rise to the enforcement action against 
them.   
c. BLNR’s reply  
In its reply, which the DLNR joined, the BLNR additionally 
argued that subject matter jurisdiction c an be raised at any 
time and it did not matter that the 2017 appeal was mistakenly 
entertained by the environmental court.    
d.   Supplemental briefing  
 
The environmental court invited supplemental briefing as to 
whether the BLNR’s FOF/COL implicated HRS Chapter 205A Part III.  
BLNR filed a supplemental brief  quoting the following portion of 
its FOF/COL to argue that the Daileys’ violation notice did not 
arise out of HRS chapter 205A Part III  and instead arose only 
out of HRS chapter 183C : 
The BLNR . . . finds and holds under the evidentiary record 
of this contested case that Petitioners Elizabeth Dailey 
and Michael Dailey willfully violated H.R.S. § 183C -4(b), 
and H.A.R. §§ 13 -5-30(b)(1994), 13 -5-22(P-9)(C-1)(1994), 
13-5-23(L-5)(D-1)(1994),  and 13-5-37(e)(1994) by 
demolishing a nonconforming rock pile and reconstructing it 
into an unauthorized and unpermitted seawall in the 
Conservation District on or about December of 2006 through 
February of 2007.  
 
DLNR joined BLNR’s supplemental brief  and also explained 
that, in 2013, it had filed a bill of particulars concerning the 
Daileys’ seawall violation.   The bill of particulars alleged  
   
     
  
  
  
 
  
  
   
        
  
  
 
 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
that the “ Daileys’ reconstruction and repair of the seawall or 
revetment located or situated within the Conservation District 
along the shoreline on the makai side of their property violated 
[HRS] § 183C -4(b), [HRS] § 205A -43.5(a),(b), [HRS] § 205A -44(b) 
and [HAR] §§ 13-5-6[,] 13-5-7, 13-5-30(b) and 13 -5-35(d).” DLNR 
further explained that a 2014 BLNR decision and order then 
concluded that DLNR lacked jurisdiction to enforce HRS chapter 
205A; therefore, the HRS chapter 205A allegations against the 
Daileys were dismissed by BLNR in 2014. 
e. Environmental court’s ruling 
On May 5, 2023 , the environmental court granted BLNR’s 
motion to dismiss in its findings of fact, conclusions of law, 
and order (“environmental court’s FOF/COL”). It agreed with 
BLNR that th is appeal arose out of HRS Chapter 183C and not HRS 
Chapter 205A Part III; therefore, it lacked jurisdiction over 
the appeal. The environmental court also declined the Daileys’ 
request to transfer the case to th is court , indicating it was 
not aware of any rule or case law allowing transfer and 
concluding it did not possess the inherent power to do so. The 
environmental court’s final judgment was filed on June 6, 2023. 
D. ICA proceedings 
In the Daileys’ appeal to the ICA, the parties essentially 
repeated their arguments in the environmental court. In its May 
16, 2024 SDO, with respect to the appellate jurisdiction issues

      ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
relevant on certiorari, the ICA affirmed the environmental 
court’s dismissal of the Daileys’ appeal. Dailey v. Dep’t of 
Land & Nat. Res. , No. CAAP -23-0000415, 2024 WL 2209726, at *7 
(Haw. App. May 16, 2024) (SDO). The ICA pointed out that the 
Daileys never disputed that their contested case arose under HRS 
Chapter 183 C, as evidenced by th e jurisdictional statements in 
the notice of appeal and statement of the case they filed with 
the environmental court. Dailey, 2024 WL 2209726, at *5. The 
ICA also noted that the record reflect ed that the Daileys’ 
seawall was makai of the shoreline, within the conservation 
district. Id. 
The ICA also agreed with the environmental court that the 
latter did not possess inherent authority to transfer the 
Daileys’ appeal to this court. Dailey, 2024 WL 2209726, at *6. 
The ICA filed its judgment on appeal on July 9, 2024. 
E. Certiorari proceedings 
On certiorari, Daile y9 first asserts the HRS Chapter 205A 
Part III exception to HRS § 183C -9 applies to his appeal because 
the location of the shoreline was a critical issue in this 
contested case proceeding . 
Secondly, Dailey raises a new argument that could not have 
been raised before the ICA’s SDO : that this court’s Honoipu

opinion indicates the environmental court had the power to 
transfer Dailey’s appeal to this court. Dailey acknowledge s 
that Honoipu said its holding was “not a license to transfer any 
case from the circuit court to our court.” Dailey nevertheless 
maintains that his appeal warrants the remedy set forth in 
Honoipu due to the environmental court’s mistaken exercise of 
jurisdiction over his 2017 contested case appeal, which created 
confusion over the appropriate appellate procedure and an 
inconsistent exercise of appellate jurisdiction. 
In response, B LNR distinguishes Honoipu. BLNR first argues 
that Honoipu’s remedy of allowing a court to transfer an agency 
appeal to this court should apply only in the narrow 
circumstances present ed in that case, where jurisdiction was 
apparently proper when the appeal was originally filed, but the 
parties’ understanding of jurisdiction shifted following a 
decision from an appellate court . 
III. Standards of Review 
A. Appellate jurisdiction 
The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law, 
reviewed de novo. Dupree v. Hiraga , 121 Hawaiʻi 297, 312, 219 
P.3d 1084, 1099 (2009). 
B. Statutory interpretation 
Statutory interpretation is guided by established rules:

 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
First, the fundamental starting point for statutory 
interpretation is the language of the statute itself. 
Second, where the statutory language is plain and 
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain 
and obvious meaning. Third, implicit in the task of 
statutory construction is our foremost obligation to 
ascertain and give effect to the intention of the 
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the 
language contained in the statute itself. Fourth, when 
there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness 
or uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, an 
ambiguity exists. 
Rees v. Carlisle , 113 Hawaiʻi 446, 452, 153 P.3d 1131, 1137 
(2007) (c leaned up ). 
IV. Discussion 
A. The HRS Chapter 205A Part III exception to HRS § 183C -9(a) 
is inapplicable ; therefore, only this court has appellate 
jurisdiction 
Dailey’s first question on certiorari asks this court to 
determine whether the HRS Chapter 205A Part III exception to HRS 
§ 183C-9(a)’s requirement that appeals be filed with this court 
applies to their appeal; if so, the environmental court would 
have had appellate jurisdiction. 
The plain language of HRS § 183 -9(a) requires appeals 
arising out of HRS chapter 183C to come directly to th is court 
The statute, however, contains an exception for “appeals . . . 
arising in whole or in part from part III of chapter 205A.” 
Despite Dailey’s argument , this enforcement action was 
undertaken entirely under HRS chapter 183C and its related 
Hawaiʻi Administrative Rules (“ HAR”).

 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
HRS Chapter 205A Part III contains statutes providing the 
City with exclusive or delegated jurisdiction over shoreline 
setback issues.10 In 2014, however, BLNR abandoned any attempt 
to enforce HRS chapter 205A against the Daileys, acknowledging 
that it lacked jurisdiction to enforce shoreline setback 
violations. Therefore, since that time, BLNR’s enforcement 
action against the Daileys has been undertaken solely under HRS 
chapter 183C governing the conservation district. 
The BLNR’s problem pinning down the location of the 
shoreline for purposes of this case does not affect this 
analysis . Even under HRS Chapter 205A Part III, it is the BLNR 
that determines shorelines.11 And the shoreline certification 
finalized in 2011 at the Daileys’ request established that the 
new seawall constructed in 2006 -07 had clearly been constructed 
in the conservation district. The Daileys never appealed this 
certification . Hence, after Act 48, pursuant to HRS § 183C -9, 
the environmental court lacked jurisdiction over both the 2017 
second appeal as well as this appeal. 
10 See HRS Chapter 205A Part III, HRS §§ 205A-41 to 205A -49 (2017). 
11 See HRS § 205A-42 (2017).

B. The constitutional and statutory bases providing the 
judiciary with inherent power to transfer appeals outlined 
in Honoipu and Rosehill provided the environmental court as 
well as this court with the power to order transfer of the 
Dailey’s appeal 
In their second question on certiorari, the Daileys 
alternatively assert that even if their appeal had been required 
to be filed directly with this court after Act 4 8, the ICA erred 
by affirming the environmental court’s determination that it 
lacked authority to transfer the appeal to this court. 
We need not decide whether th e ICA or the environmental 
court erred, as error is not a prerequisite to t his court ’s 
acceptance of certiorari. See Hussein, 122 Hawaiʻi at 514, 229 
P.3d at 332. At the time the environmental court dismissed the 
case for lack of jurisdiction, and the ICA affirmed, this 
court’s Honoipu and Rosehill opinions had yet to be published . 
Honoipu involved a petition for a declaratory order for the 
LUC to change the boundary location between conservation and 
agricultural districts on a district boundary map. 154 Hawaiʻi 
at 373, 550 P.3d at 1231. The LUC denied the petition, and 
Honoipu Hideaway appealed the decision to the circuit court. 
Id. 
Since 2016 , Act 48 also expressly required that appeals 
from LUC contested case decisions be filed with this court, but 
it was silent on appeals of declaratory orders. Id. In Lingle 
v. Haw. Gov’t Emps. Ass’n, AFSCME, Loc. 152, AFL -CIO, however, 
21  
   
 
    
  
  
  
  
  
   
 
    
 
  
 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
we held that although declaratory orders are not contested 
cases, they have the same status for the purpose of appeal 
rights under HRS § 91 -14. 107 Hawai ʻi 178, 186, 111 P.3d 587, 
595 (2005). Hence, in Kanahele , we interpreted Act 48 to 
require agency appeals from both contested cases and declaratory 
orders to come to this court. Honoipu, 154 Hawai ʻi at 374, 550 
P.3d at 1232 (citation omitted). 
After Kanahele was filed , Honoipu Hideaway moved to 
transfer its pending appeal in the circuit court to this court. 
Id. In response, t he LUC moved to dismiss the appeal for lack 
of subject matter jurisdiction. Id. The circuit court then 
submitted a reserved question to this court: “Whether [the 
circuit court] has inherent and statutory authority to transfer 
nunc pro tunc an appeal, which was timely filed with [the 
circuit court], to the Supreme Court of Hawai ʻi as the court with 
appellate jurisdiction.” 154 Hawai ʻi at 373, 550 P.3d at 1231. 
This court answered in the affirmative. Id. We held that 
“in order to correct jurisdiction following this court’s 
decision in Kanahele , the circuit court may transfer the case 
here nunc pro tunc, or backdated to the appropriate time. 
Allowing such a transfer in these limited circumstances accords 
with our longstanding policy to hear cases on the merits, and 
there is both inherent and statutory power for the courts to do 
so.” 154 Hawaiʻi at 374, 550 P.3d at 1232. 
22  
   
 
  
  
   
 
  
    
   ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
As to statutory authority for such a transfer of the 
appeal, this court cited the circuit court’s authority under HRS 
§ 603-21.9(1) “[t]o make and issue all orders and writs 
necessary or appropriate in aid of their original or appellate 
jurisdiction.” 154 Hawaiʻi at 375, 550 P.3d at 123 3. We also 
cited HRS § 602 -5(a)(5) for this court’s authority “[t]o make 
and issue any order or writ necessary or appropriate in aid of 
[this court’s] jurisdiction.” Id. In addition to statut ory 
authority, however, we also cited Hawaiʻi Constitution’s Article 
VI, Section 1 ’s “judicial power ,” which include s the inherent 
“power to administer justice,” such as the power to “prevent 
unfair results and to curb abuses and promote a fair process.” 
154 Hawaiʻi at 376, 550 P.3d at 1234. (cleaned up). 
In Honoipu, we said that “the power to ‘do such other acts 
and take such other steps as may be necessary to carry into full 
effect the powers which are or shall be given to them by law or 
for the promotion of justice’ gives the circuit court the power 
to correct a jurisdictio nal mistake that was no party’s or 
court’s fault.” Id. We also considered the judiciary’s policy 
of hearing cases on the merits whenever possible. Id. We noted 
that “the judicially efficient remedy is to transfer the case to 
this court nunc pro tunc [to the date the notice of appeal was 
filed with the circuit court] so that we may address the merits 
23  
   
   
  
  
   
   
 
   
  
  
 
     
  
    
 
  ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
questions more expeditiously.” 154 Hawaiʻi at 377, 550 P.3d at 
1235. 
After Honoipu, in Rosehill , landowners had also appealed an 
adverse LUC declaratory ruling to the circuit court. 155 Hawaiʻi 
at 45, 556 P.3d at 391. The circuit court reversed the LUC. 
Id. The LUC then appealed to the ICA. Id. While the appeal 
was pending before the ICA, we issued Kanahele . Id. In 
Rosehill , we accepted a transfer of the appeal from the ICA and 
then deemed the transfer accepted nunc pro tunc to the date the 
appeal was originally incorrectly filed in the circuit court. 
Id. We also held that , in reaching the merits of the appeal, we 
could use the entirety of the record although the circuit 
court's findings of fact and conclusions of law had no weight 
because the court had lacked a ppellate jurisdiction. Id. 
We recognize that this case differs from Honoipu and 
Rosehill . Both Honoipu and Rosehill limited their holdings 
regarding appellate jurisdiction to the “limited circumstances” 
of those cases, where appeals of LUC declaratory orders were 
pending in our lower courts when Kahahele was published. 
Honoipu, 154 Hawaiʻi at 374, 550 P.3d at 1232; Rosehill , 155 
Hawaiʻi at 50, 556 P.3d at 396. In Honoipu, we expressly stated 
that our opinion was “not a license to transfer any case from 
the circuit court to our court. Rather, in this limited 
circumstance, in which jurisdiction was proper when the appe al 
24  
  
   
  
 
    
  
    
 
  
  
    
    ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
was originally filed, but the parties’ understanding of 
jurisdiction shifted following a decision from an appellate 
court, transfer to perfect jurisdiction is appropriate.” 
Honoipu, 154 Hawaiʻi at 377, 550 P.3d at 123 5. 
Here, the Daileys mistakenly filed their appeal from a 
contested case decision to the environmental court in July 2022. 
The Daileys mistakenly believed the environmental court had 
jurisdiction, but the BLNR asserted a lack of jurisdiction in 
that court . Jurisdiction was not proper in the environmental 
court when the appeal was filed. The environmental court 
granted BLNR’s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and 
declined to transfer the case to this court , stating it was not 
aware of any rule or case law allowing such transfer and that it 
did not believe it had the inherent power to transfer the 
appeal. 
But, as noted in Honoipu, our appellate courts have long 
adhered to the policy of permitting litigants, where possible, 
to appeal and to have their cases heard on the merits. Honoipu, 
154 Hawaiʻi at 376, 550 P.3d at 1234 (citation omitted). And, as 
further noted in Honoipu, various other jurisdictions have held 
that courts have inherent authority to transfer appeals for lack 
of jurisdiction when timely appeals have been filed in the wrong 
court. See Honoipu, 154 Hawaiʻi at 376, 376 n.3, 550 P.3d at 
1234, 1234 n.3.

         ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
For example, we cited to Pearce v. Dir., Off. of Workers’ 
Comp. Programs, U.S. Dep’t of Lab., 603 F.2d 763, 771 (9th Cir. 
1979), which collected cases and not ed that the Ninth Circuit 
has held it has “power to transfer a pending case to another 
circuit even when the latter circuit has exclusive jurisdiction 
and venue to review the order in question .” We also cited to 
People v. Nickerson , 128 Cal.App.4 th 33, 26 Cal. Rptr. 3d 563, 
567 (2005), which points out that inherent authority, among 
other things, “empowers [the California appellate court] to 
order transfer [of an appeal]”) . We also pointed to Pridgen v. 
Head, 282 Ala. 193, 210 So.2d 426, 429 (1968), in which the 
Alabama Supreme Court held in denying a motion to dismiss appeal 
that “[t]he fact that the appeal was taken to the Court of 
Appeals rather than to [the supreme court] does not justify a 
dismissal of the appeal. The cause has been transferred to this 
court in keeping with a practice of long standing where the 
appeal is taken to the wrong court. ” We also favorably cited 
Dunn v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 654 F.2d 64, 68 (Ct. Cl. 1981), 
which noted the Court of Claims’ inherent power to transfer a 
case to a an appellate court with exclusive jurisdiction. 
Finally, we referred to Commonwealth v. Carter, 36 Pa. Cmwlth. 
569, 389 A.2d 241, 242 (1978), which held that “[w]here the 
defect is the erroneous filing of the proceeding in the wrong 
26  
  
  
    
   
  
 
 
 
  
    
  
 
    
 
 
  
 
   
 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
court, this error may be corrected by certifying the case to the 
proper tribunal.” 
These cases do not limit transfers of appeals to situations 
where parties’ understanding of jurisdiction shifted following a 
decision from an appellate court. Rather, they recognize the 
much broader inherent power of courts. And, as we pointed out 
in Honoipu, inherent powers of courts grounded in the 
constitutional judicial power also provide courts with inherent 
power to transfer appeals to the proper court.12 Hence, we hold 
that the environmental court had the power to transfer the 
Daileys’ timely appeal to this court. 
The existence of th e power to transfer appeals does not 
mean it must always be exercise d. For example, we w ould not 
countenance an attorney repeatedly filing appeals in any court 
on the assumption t he appeals would be transferred to the court 
with appellate jur isdiction. But where a timely appeal is 
inadvertently filed in the wrong court, it should be 
transferred.13 In turn, the court to which an appeal is 
12 We also note that HRAP Rule 3(a) (eff. 2019) allows an appeal 
erroneously filed with the clerk of the court or agency appealed from to 
effectively be transferred to the appellate court. This rule would not apply 
here, but this rule does provide authority for some erroneously filed appeals 
to be tra nsferred. 
13 Although not applicable here, we note that c ourts also have the 
inherent discretionary power to address any prejudice to other parties 
through other means, such as an award of reasonable attorney fees and costs 
unnecessarily incurred due to the filing of appeals in the wrong court.

 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
transferred will likewise have statutory , constitutional and 
inherent authority to determine whether the transfer was 
properly made . 14 
Therefore, we conclude the power to transfer appeals can 
and should be exercised under the facts and circumstances of 
this case. This is especially because neither the BLNR nor the 
environmental court noticed the lack of appellate jurisdiction 
in the Daileys’ second appeal. And not requiring a transfer 
here would preclude a decision on the merits of the Daileys’ 
appeal, 15 contravening our long-standing policy of permitting 
litigants, where possible, to appeal and to have their cases 
heard on the merits. 
Hence, u nder the circumstances of this case, we order the 
environmental court to transfer the appeal to this court nunc 
pro tunc to the date of its July 15, 2022 filing as soon as this 
court’s judgment on appeal has entered. The appeal on the 
merits i s then to proceed in this court pursuant to the HRAP, 
with deadlines to correspond with the date the appeal is 
actually transferred to this court. 
14 For example, the transferee court might determine that the appeal was 
untimely filed or that it should have been made to another court. 
15 If dismissal of the appeal is affirmed, the deadline for filing an 
appeal to this court would have long expired.

V. Conclusion 
Based on the reasons above, we vacate the ICA’s July 9, 
2024 judgment on appeal , the environmental court’s May 5, 2023 
“Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Granting 
Appellee Board of Land and Natural Resources ’ Motion to Dismiss 
Appeal,” as well as its June 6, 2023 “Final Judgment .” We order 
the environmental court to transfer the appeal to this court 
nunc pro tunc to the date of its July 15, 2022 filing as soon as 
this court’s judgment on appeal has entered. The appeal on the 
merits is then to proceed in this court pursuant to the HRAP, 
with deadlines to correspond with the date the appeal is 
actually transferred to this court.
