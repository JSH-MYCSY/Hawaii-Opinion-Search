SCWC-23-0000736  
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF 
HAWAIʻI  
GARRETH A. GRAHAM,  
Petitioner/Petitioner-Appellant,  
 
vs.  
 
HAWAIʻI PAROLING AUTHORITY; STATE OF HAWAIʻI, 
Respondents/Respondents-Appellees.  
CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS  
(CAAP-23-0000736; CASE NO. 1CPN-19-0000005 (1PC940001048))  
ORDER DISMISSING  APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI  
(By: McKenna, Acting C.J., Eddins, Ginoza,  and Devens,  JJ., and 
Circuit Judge  Nakamoto,  assigned by reason of vacancy)  
This court construes Petitioner Garreth A. Graham’s 
(Graham) “‘Notice of Appeal’ regarding my application for writ 
of certiorari to the Supreme Cout of Hawaiʻi,” received by the 
appellate clerk on December 12, 2025, as an application for writ 
of certiorari (application ). As of December 12, 2025, the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals ( ICA) had not yet filed a Judgment 
on Appeal. The ICA filed its Judgment on Appeal on January 12, 
2026.        Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Graham’s 
application is dismissed without prejudice to re-filing the 
application pursuant to Hawai ʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure 
(HRAP) Rule 40.1(a) (2020) (“The application shall be filed 
within thirty days after  the filing of the intermediate court of 
appeals’ judgment on appeal or dismissal order, unless the time for filing the application is extended in accordance with this 
rule.”  (emphasis added)).  
 
 Graham also filed a letter received by the appellate 
clerk on January 20, 2026, notifying this court that he wishes 
to “withdraw the Notice of Appeal regarding the Application For 
Writ of Certiorari” filed on December 12, 2025. This court construes the letter as a motion to withdraw the application 
(motion).  
     IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the motion is 
dismissed  as moot.    
       
       
       
       
       DATED: Honolulu, Hawaiʻi, January 26, 2026.
