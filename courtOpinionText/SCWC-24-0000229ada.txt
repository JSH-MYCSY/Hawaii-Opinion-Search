OPINION OF THE COURT BY GINOZA, J.  
This appeal arises out of a dispute over a renewable 
energy technologies income tax credit (RETITC) and Hawai‘i 
Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 235-12.5 (Supp. 2011), the statute that 
governs the RETITC program . The central i ssue before this court  
 
 
  
   
 
    
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
is whether the Intermediate Court of Appeal s (ICA) erred in its 
interpretation of HRS § 235 -12.5(f)-(h), 1 and its determinatio n 
1 HRS § 235 -12.5(f)-(h) (Supp. 2011) states: 
(f) If the tax credit under this section exceeds 
the taxpayer ’s income tax liability, the excess of the 
credit over liability may be used as a credit against the 
taxpayer’s income tax liability in subsequent years until 
exhausted, unless otherwise elected by the taxpayer 
pursuant to subsection (g) or (h). . . . Failure to comply 
with this subsection shall constitute a waiver of the right 
to claim the credit . 
(g) For solar energy systems, a taxpayer may elect 
to reduce the eligible credit amount by thirty per cent and 
if this reduced amount exceeds the amount of incom e tax 
payment due from the taxpayer, the excess of the credit 
amount over payments due shall be refunded to the taxpayer; 
provided that tax credit amounts properly claimed by a 
taxpayer who has no income tax liability shall be paid to 
the taxpayer; and provided further that no refund on 
account of the tax credit allowed by this section shall be 
made for amounts less than $1. 
The election required by this subsection shall be 
made in a manner prescribed by the director on the 
taxpayer’s return for the taxable year in which the system 
is installed and placed in service. . . . An election once 
made is irrevocable .  
(h) Notwithstanding subsection (g), for any 
renewable energy technology system, an individual taxpayer 
may elect to have any excess of the credit over payments 
due refunded to the taxpayer, if: 
(1) All of the taxpayer’s income is exempt from 
taxation under section 235 –7(a)(2) or (3); or 
(2) The taxpayer’s adjusted gross income is $20,000 
or less (or $40,000 or less if filing a tax 
return as married filing jointly); 
provided that tax credits properly claimed by a taxpayer 
who has no income tax liability shall be paid to the 
taxpayer; and provided further that no refund on account of 
the tax credit allowed by this section shall be made for 
amounts less than $1.

that the 2012 tax form  used  for claiming  RETITC  (2012 Form N-
342) and its accompanying instructions, both prescribed by the 
Department of Taxation, State of Hawai‘i, are consistent with the 
applicable statutory provisions.   
We hold  that 2012 Form N-342  and its accompanying 
instructions are inconsistent with HRS § 235 -12.5(f)-(h). Based 
on the plain language of the statute, HRS § 235 -12.5(f)-(h) (the 
provisions governing “refundable” or “nonrefundable” treatment 
of excess tax credit) only apply to situations where a 
taxpayer’s tax credit exceeds their tax liability . Excess tax 
credit is a threshold qualification for making elections 
pursuant to those subsections . Accordingly, 2012 Form N -342 is 
incompatible with the statute because it requires taxpayers who 
do not have excess tax credit to make irrevocable elections that 
do not apply to them. The instructions that accompany 2012 Form 
N-342 also reflect this contradiction and error. Petitioners 
did not have excess tax credit and were improperly required to 
make elections inapplicable to them. 
We thus vacate the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal , and 
reverse the Tax Appeal Court ’s Final Judgment. Petit ioners are 
entitled to the RETITC they claimed in 2012.

I. BACKGROUND 
On their 2012 Hawai‘i income tax return, 
Petitioners/Appellees -Appellants, Blake Goodman and Blanca 
Goodman (collectively, Petitioners ), claimed $17,250 in RETITC 
associated with solar energy system s installed on their Hawai‘i 
home. In claiming the RETITC, Petitioners completed and 
submitted four 2012 Form N -342s with their 2012 Hawai‘i income 
tax return. On line 42 of the form, despite having no excess 
tax credit (because their claimed $17,250 tax credit was less 
than their $25,252 net tax liability2), Petitioners were 
“required” to make an “irrevocable” election “to treat the tax 
credit” as either: (a) “refundable” (pursuant to HRS § 235 -
12.5(g) or (h)); or (b) “nonrefundable” (pursuant to HRS § 235 -
12.5(f)). Immediately above line 42, the form instructs: “THIS 
SECTION MUST BE COMPLETED.” Petitioners elected to treat the 
tax credit as “refundable” (line 42 election) . Given that 
election, Petitioners answered line 43 and furth er elected to 
treat their tax credit as “fully refundable” under an option 
applicable only to taxpayers who either have tax -exempt income, 
or who earn an annual joint adjusted gross income of $40,000 or 
less (line 43 election), pursuant to HRS § 235 -12.5(h). 
2 Petitioners’ net tax liability was calculated from the 
information provided on their 2012 Hawai‘i income tax return, specifically 
Form N-11. According to their 2012 Form N -11, Petitioners’ total 2012 tax 
liability was $33,473, and $8, 221 had been withheld from their income that 
year, making their net tax liability $25,252 ($33,473 -$8,221 = $25,252).

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Petitioners admitted that they did not consult the instructions 
to 2012 Form N -342 when completing their 2012 Hawai‘i tax return. 
After deducting $8,221 in Hawai‘i State income tax 
withholdings and taking a deduction of the full $17,250 in 
claimed RETITC from their $33,473 tax liability, Petitioners 
paid $8,002 in taxes to the Department for 2012 . 
That same year, the Department of Taxation, State of 
Hawai‘i, audited Petitioners’ 2012 Hawai‘i income tax return and 
issued a “Notice of Final Assessment” reducing Petitioners’ 
claimed RETITC by 30% (plus interest), for a total assessment of 
$5,416.50  in additional tax and interest against Petitioners 
(Final Assessment ).3 The Final Assessment stated that 
adjustments were made to Petitioners’ 2012 tax return in 
accordance with HRS § 235 -12.5 and the RETITC reduction was 
imposed as a result of Petitioners making improper irrevocable 
elections on lines 42 and 43 of their completed 2012 Form N -
342s. The Department noted that “once an election on Form N -
342, line 42 is made, it cannot be revoked or amended as 
provided under section 235 -12.5(g), [HRS].” According to the 
Final Assessment, Petitioners had irrevocably elected to treat 
their RETITC as refundable , an election they were not entitled 
3 Per the Department, the amount in the Final Assessment was 
calculated by taking 30% of Petitioners claimed RETITC (0.30 x $17,250 = 
$5,175) and adding interest in the amount of $241.50, for a total of 
$5,416.50 ($5,175 + $241.50 = $5,416.50).

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
to because their income was not exempt from Hawai‘i taxation and 
their joint Hawai‘i adjusted gross income exceeded $40,000. 
On or around October 18, 2013, Petitioners appealed to 
the Board of Taxation Review ( Board), naming 
Respondent/Appellant -Appellee Gary S. Suganuma,4 Director, 
Department of Taxation, State of Hawai‘i (Director or 
Department ),5 as the defendant. On or around February 3, 2015, 
the Board issued a unanimous decision in favor of Petitioners, 
holding that their election to treat the RETITC as refundable on 
line 42 was not irrevocable pursuant to HRS § 235 -12.5(f), and 
ordering that Petitioners be permitted to amend their line 42 
and 43 elections on their 2012 Hawai‘i income tax return 
accordin gly (Board’s Decision ). 
The Department appealed to the Tax Appeal Court.6 
There, the Department filed a motion for summary judgment ( MSJ) 
asking the court to determine that the Department’s Final 
4    Gary S. Suganuma, the current director of taxation, is 
substituted for former director, Maria E. Zielinski, pursuant to the Hawai‘i  
Rules of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP
) Rule 43(c). HRAP Rule 43(c) ( “When a 
public officer is a party to an appeal or other proceeding in the Hawai ‘i 
appellate courts in their official capacity and during its pendency dies, 
resigns,  or otherwise ceases to hold office ,  . . . their successor is 
automatically substituted as a party. ”).    
5 Because the parties refer to the Director and the Department 
interchangeably, this opinion also does so to avoid confusion. 
6 The Honorable Gary W.B. Chang presided.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Assessment of $ 5,416.50 was lawful and valid . The Tax App eal 
Court granted the Department’s MSJ a nd stated in its order : 
1. The Court finds and concludes that 
[Petitioners]’ [2012] Form [N -342], line 42(a) and line 
43(b) were irrevocable and [Petitioners] cannot amend their 
State of Hawaii income tax return for tax year 2012. 
2. The Director cannot overlook the irrevocable 
nature of [Petitioners]’ election on their [2012] Form [N -
342], line 43(b) election. 
3. [Petitioners] are ordered to pay the Director 
an additional amount of $17,250.00 . . . in income taxe s 
due for tax year 2012 based upon the calculation . . . [in 
the] Court’s Minute Order[,] filed on November 14, 2023[.] 
Whereas the Board’s Decision would have allowed 
Petitioners to amend their line 42 and 43 elections on the 2012 
Form N-342, the Tax Ap peal Court would not. Under the Tax 
Appeal Court’s decision, Petitioners would not be entitled to 
any RETITC. The Tax Appeal Court entered its ruling in the 
following : (a) Minute Order, filed November 14, 2023; (b) “Order 
Regarding Appellant Maria E. Zielinski, Director of Taxation, 
State of Hawaii’s Motion for Summary Judgment Filed on May 18, 
2017[,]” ( MSJ Order ), filed March 15, 2024; and (c) “Final 
Judgment Re: Order Regarding Appellant Maria E. Zielinski, 
Director of Taxation, State of Hawaii’s Mo tion for Summary 
Judgment Filed on May 18, 2017” ( Final Judgment ), filed on March 
15, 2024. 
Petitioners appealed to the ICA, raising one point of 
error: 
The Tax Appeal Court erred as a matter of law and abused 
its discretion, when it decided that the applicable rules 
7  
 
 
  
 
 
  
  
   
    
   
 
   
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
controlling this case are based on the Director’s Tax Form 
N-342, instead of based on substantive Hawaii law.  
On October 17, 2024, the ICA i ssued a Memorandum 
Opinion holding, inter alia , that the Tax Appeal Court : (1) 
exceeded its jurisdiction “by increasing [Petitioners]’ tax 
liability to more than the amount of the [Final Assessment, ]” in 
violation of HRS § 232 -13 (2001);7 and (2) should h ave affirmed 
the Department’s Final Assessment of $ 5,416.50 , based on the 
plain language of the statute, and the circumstances presented 
in this case. Suganuma v. Goodman , No. CAAP -24-0000229, 2024 WL 
4511252, at *3 -5 (Haw. App. Oct. 17, 2024) (mem. op.). In 
support of its second holding, the ICA determined that 2012 Form 
N-342 and its accompanying instructions are “consistent with” 
HRS § 235 -12.5. Id. at *3-5. As a result, the ICA vacated the 
Tax Appeal Court’s MSJ Order and Final Judgment, and remanded to 
the Tax Appeal Court with instructions for that court to affirm 
the Department’s Final Assessment of $ 5,416.50  against 
Petitioners. Id. at *6. 
We accepted Petitioners’  application for writ of 
certiorari. Petitioners  challenge the ICA’s  interpretation and 
7 HRS § 232 -13 (2001) provides, in relevant part, that: 
The jurisdiction of the tax appeal court is limited 
to the amount of valuation or taxes, as the case may be, in 
dispute as shown on the one hand by the amount claimed by 
the taxpayer or county and on the other hand by the amount 
of the assessment, or if in creased by the board, or 
equivalent county administrative body, the assessment as so 
increased.

     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
application of HRS § 235-12.5  and its decision to affirm the 
Department’s Final Assessment.   Petitioners assert that  the 2012  
Form N-342 and its  instructions are incompatible with  the 
“statutory scheme” of  HRS § 235-12.5.  Petitioners contend that:   8
The issue is not whether a lazy taxpayer in not carefully 
reading the [f]orms and [i]nstructions should be hung out 
to dry for his own errors, but rather should a poorly 
drafted set of tax [f]orms and [i]nstructions be allowed to 
penalize those taxpayers, when the laws enacted by the 
Hawaii legislature are being “altered” by those [f]orms and 
[i]nstructions in total contravention to the law’s simple 
meaning. 
Petitioners  further  assert  that  none of the irrevocable 
elections forced upon them in  Form N-342 are required to be 
made under HRS § 235-12.5,  because they did not have an 
excess tax credit, i.e.,  a tax credit that exceeded their 
tax liability.  
In response, the Department asserts that Petitioners’ 
argument that there must  be an excess tax credit to take 
advantage of the RETITC is nonsensical, and that, based on the 
plain language of HRS  § 235-12.5, permission to elect 
refundability is not dependent on the presence or absence of tax 
8   Petitioners clarify in their application that they do not 
challenge  the portion of the ICA’s Memorandum Opinion wherein the ICA (1) 
vacated the Tax Appeal  Court’s assessment of $17,250 against Petitioners; and 
(2) determined that the Tax Appeal Court exceeded its jurisdiction in 
increasing Petitioners’ tax liability to more than the Director’s original 
assessment in violation of HRS § 232 -13 and Tax Appeal of County of Maui v. 
KM Haw. Inc., 81 Hawai‘i  248, 915 P.2d 1349 (1996).  
Moreover, t he Department did not file a petition for writ of 
certiorari , and thus no party challenges the ICA’s ruling that the Tax Appeal 
Court exceeded its jurisdiction. In any event, we need not address this 
issue relating to the Tax Appeal Court’s jurisdiction because we resolve this 
appeal on other grounds.

liability . The Department asserts that taxpayers are free to 
claim the RETITC in either refundable or nonrefundable form . 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Statutory Interpretation 
Questions of statutory interpretation are questions of law 
to be reviewed de novo under the right/wrong standard. 
Our statutory construction is guided by the following 
well established principles: 
our foremost obligation is to ascertain and 
give effect to the intention of the 
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily 
from the language contained in the statute 
itself. And we must read statutory language in 
the context of the entire statute and construe 
it in a manner consistent with its purpose. 
When there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or 
indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an 
expression used in a statute, an ambiguity 
exists. 
In construing an ambiguous statute, the meaning 
of the ambiguous words may be sought by 
examining the context, with which the ambiguous 
words, phrases, and sentences may be compared, 
in order to ascertain their true meaning. 
Moreover, the courts may resort to extrinsic 
aids in determining legislative intent. One 
avenue is the use of legislative history as an 
interpretive tool. 
This court may also consider the reason and spirit of 
the law, and the cause which induced the legislature 
to enact it to discover its true meaning.

quotation marks, brackets,  and ellipses omitted) (quoting Guth

    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
B. Summary Judgment 
This court reviews an award of summary judgment de novo, 
under the same standards applied by the trial court. 
Therefore, summary judgment is appropriate if the 
pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and 
admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, 
show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact 
and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a 
matter of law. 
Moreover, it is well settled that, in reviewing the 
decision and findings of the Tax Appeal 
Court, a presumption arises favoring its actions which 
should not be overturned without good and sufficient 
reason. 
West  Maui Resort Partners LP v. Cnty. of Maui, 154 Hawai‘i  121,

653, 656 (1998) (internal quotation marks, emphases, and 
citations omitted)).   Where the facts are undisputed and  the 
only question is one of law, we review the Tax Appeal Court’s 
decision under the  right/wrong standard. Id.  (citation 
omitted).   
III. DISCUSSION 
Petitioners’ a ppeal to this court challenges the ICA’s 
interpretation and application of HRS § 235 -12.5(f)-(h). 
Petitioners assert, inter alia , that the ICA and the 
Department’s misinterpretation and misapplication of the 
challenged provision s is evidenced by the 2012 Form N -342 and 
its associated instructions , which Petitioners contend are 
incompatible with the statutory scheme. We agree .

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
This Court has  not previously interpreted HRS § 235-
12.5.   HRS § 235-12.5 governs Hawai‘i’s RETITC. HRS § 235-12.5 
was enacted in 2003 via Act 207. 2003 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 207, 
§ 2 at 580-81. At the time of its enactment, the legislature stated  that the purpose of the statute was “to encourage the use 
of renewable energy systems and reduce the State’s reliance on fossil fuel[.]”   H.  Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 916, in 2003 House 
Journal, at 1451-52.   HRS § 235-12.5 has since been amended 
multiple times.   The version of the statute effective in 2012 is 
applicable to this case.  
For context, HRS § 235 -12.5(a)-(d) (Supp. 2011) 
provides, in relevant part : 
(a) When the requirements of subsection (d) are 
met, each individual . . . taxpayer that files an 
individual . . . net income tax return for a taxable year 
may claim a tax credit under this section against the 
Hawaii state individual . . . net income tax. The tax 
credit may be claimed for every eligible renewable energy 
technology system[9] that is in stalled and placed in service 
in the State by a taxpayer during the taxable year . The 
tax credit may be claimed as follows: 
(1) For each solar energy system: thirty -five per 
cent of the actual cost or the cap amount determined in 
subsection (b), whichever i s less[.] 
9 HRS § 235-12.5(c) (Supp. 2011) provides, in relevant part, that: 
“Renewable energy technology system” means a new 
system that captures and converts a renewable source of 
energy, such as solar or wind energy, into:  
(1) A usable source of thermal or mechanical 
energy; 
(2) Electricity; or 
(3) Fuel.

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(b) The amount of credit allowed for each eligible 
renewable energy technology system shall not exceed the 
applicable cap amount, which is determined as follows: 
 . . . . 
(2) For all . . . solar energy systems [other than 
those for which the primary purpose is to use 
energy from the sun to heat water for household 
use], the cap amounts shall be: 
(A) $5,000 per system for single -family 
residential property[.] 
. . . . 
(d) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2005, 
the dollar amount of any utility rebate shall be deducted from 
the cost of the qualifying system and its installation before 
applying the state tax credit. 
(e) The director of taxation shall prepare any forms that 
may be necessary to claim a tax credit under this section, 
including forms ident ifying the technology type of each tax 
credit claimed under this section, whether for solar or wind. 
The director may also require the taxpayer to furnish reasonable 
information to ascertain the validity of the claim for credit 
made under this section and may adopt rules necessary to 
effectuate the purposes of this section pursuant to chapter 91. 
Under HRS § 235 -12.5(a), a tax credit may be claimed 
for each eligible renewable energy  technology  system installed  
and placed in service in Hawai‘i  during the  taxable year.  Here, 
Petitioners claimed they installed  solar energy systems  on their 
Hawai‘i home in 2012, making them eligible to claim RETITC that 
same taxable year, pursuant to HRS § 235-12.5(a).   The 
approximate  total  cost of Petitioners’ installed systems  was 
$60,552.   With  their 2012 10 Hawai‘i  income tax return, Petitioners 
submitted four  2012 Form N-342s, claiming a total of  $17,250 in 
10 Three of Petitioners’ 2012 Form N -342s each claimed an 
installation cost of $18,025, and the remaining form claimed an installation 
cost of $6,477, for a combined total claimed installation cost of $60,552.

RETITC: three forms  each  claiming  a  $5,000  RETITC;  and one form 
claiming  a  $2,250  RETITC.11  
The  remaining  relevant  portions of HRS § 235-12.5 
provide:  
(f)  If the tax credit  under this section exceeds 
the  taxpayer ’s income tax liability, the excess of the 
credit  over liability  may be used as a credit against the  
taxpayer’ s income tax liability in subsequent years  until  
exhausted, unless otherwise elected by the taxpayer 
pursuant  to subsection (g) or (h). . . . Failure to comply  
with this  subsection shall constitute a waiver of the right  
to claim  the credit.  
(g) For solar energy systems, a taxpayer may elect 
to reduce the eligible credit amount by thirty per cent and 
if this reduced amount exceeds the amount of income tax 
payment due from the taxpayer , the excess of the credit 
amount over payments due shall be refunded to the taxpayer; 
provided that tax credit amounts properly claimed by a 
taxpayer who has no income tax liability shall be paid to 
the taxpayer; and provided further that no refund on 
account of the tax credit allowed by this section shal l be 
made for amounts less than $1. 
The election required by this subsection shall be 
made in a manner prescribed by the director on the 
taxpayer ’s return for the taxable year in which the system 
is installed and placed in service. . . . An election once 
made is irrevocable . 
(h)  Notwithstanding subsection (g), for any  
renewable energy technology system, an individual taxpayer

have only claimed a RETITC of $5,000. The ICA treated this issue as waived 
presumably because the Department did not raise the issue in the Final 
Assessment nor in any of the subsequent appeals. This issue was not raised 
to this court on certiorari and thus we need not address it .

of excess  RETITC  over payments due where, among other things,

election once made is irrevocable.”  
Here, the Department prescribed 2012 Form N -342 
as the means to claim the tax credit under HRS § 235-12.5.   
The relevant portions of Petitioners’ submitted 2012 Form N-342s appear in the record as follows:  
IRREVOCABLE ELECTION ON HOW TO TREAT THE TAX CREDIT THIS 
SECTION MUST BE COMPLETED. 
42. I elect to treat the tax credit as: (check only one 
box) Note: Once an election is made, it cannot be 
revoked or amended. 
☒ a. Refundable (Go to line 43 and complete lines 43 
through 47; skip lines 48 through 55.) 
☐ b. Nonrefundable (Go to line 48 an d complete lines 
48 through 55; skip lines 43 through 47.) 
REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT Complete this section if you checked 
the box on line 42a. 
43. Check the appropriate box: 
☐ a. I elect to treat the tax credit for a solar 
energy system as refundable. The amount of the 
tax credit will be reduced by 30%. 
☒ b. I elect to treat the tax credit for a solar 
energy system or a wind -powered energy system 
as refundable. ALL of my in come is exempt from

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Important to this case, immediately above line 42, it states: 
“IRREVOCABLE ELECTION ON HOW TO TREAT THE TAX CREDIT[.] THIS 
SECTION MUST BE COMPLETED .” (Emphasis added.) Based on the 
plain language of HRS § 235 -12.5, 2012 Form N -342 is not 
compatible with the statute. 
As noted above, HRS § 235-12.5(f)-(h) only apply to 
situations where a taxpayer’s  claimed RETITC  exceeds their tax 
liability. Thus, pursuant to the plain language of the statute: 
excess  RETITC  is  a threshold qualification for making elections 
pursuant to subsection (f), (g), and (h). Line 42  of 2012 Form 
N-342  reflects a combination of election options under  
subsections (f), (g), and (h): the decision of whether to treat 
excess  RETITC  as  “nonrefundable”  (carry over excess  credits  to 
subsequent years’ tax liability) or “refundable”  (receive a full 
or partial refund of the excess  credit).   Nothing in the statute 
requires  a taxpayer  to make such an election where, as in this 
case, no excess  RETITC  exists.  
It appears that the Tax Appeal Court and the ICA 
interpreted HRS § 235 -12.5 based on a strict construction of the 
“irrevocable” language in subsections (g) and (h). Neither the 
plain language nor legislative history of the statute explain s 
why refundable elections under subsections (g) and (h) are 
17  
 
 
  
   
  
   
    
 
 
  
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
irrevocable. Nonetheless, we conclude based on the plain 
language of the statute that taxpayers who do not  have excess 
RETITC should not  be required to make elections on a tax form 
that only apply to the treatment of excess tax credit  under HRS 
§ 235-12.5(f)-(h).   In other words, a taxpayer without  an excess  
RETITC (the tax credit does not exceed tax liability owed) 
should not be required to decide whether a non-existent excess 
credit is refundable or non-refundable.  
Because line 42 of 2012 Form N -342 required that a 
taxpayer with no excess RETITC make an “irrevocable” election 
that did not apply to them, the form is incompatible with HRS 
§ 235-12.5(f)-(h). Under our interpretation of the statute, 
only taxpayers with excess RETITC should be required to make 
such an election on how to treat their excess RETITC. This is 
consistent with the plain meaning of HRS § 235 -12.5, and also 
comports with our existing recognition that “tax laws should be 
strictly construed and any doubt resolved in favor of the 
public.” Kaheawa Wind Power, LLC v. Cnty. of Maui , 146 Hawai‘i

Having determined that 2012 Form N-342 is  incompatible 
with the statute,  we  next  consider  whether the  instructions that 
accompanied the form are  compatible with the statute. The 
instructions state:  
A taxpayer may elect  to treat the tax credit as 
nonrefundable or refundable. If a taxpayer elects to treat 
the tax credit as nonrefundable, the tax credit allowed 
shall be claimed against the net income tax liability for the taxable year. A tax credit that exceeds the taxpayer’s 
income tax liability may be used as a credit against the 
taxpayer’s income tax liability in subsequent years until 
exhausted. A taxpayer may elect to treat the tax credit as 
refundable under the following circumstances:  
• For solar energy systems, a taxpayer may elect to 
reduce the eligible credit amount by 30%. If this 
reduced amount exceeds the amount of income tax 
payment due from the taxpayer, t he excess of the 
credit amount over payments due will be refunded to 
the taxpayer. 
• For any renewable energy technology system, an 
individual taxpayer may elect to have any excess of 
the credit over payments due refunded to the taxpayer 
without any further reduction if (1) ALL of the 
taxpayer’s income is exempt from taxation under 
section 235-7(a)(2), Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) . 
. . ; or (2) the taxpayer has Hawaii adjusted gross 
income of $20,000 or less (or $40,000 or less if 
filing a tax return as married filing jointly). 
 . . . . 
A separate election may be made for each separate 
system that generates a tax credit. Once an election is made to treat the tax credit as nonrefundable or 
refundable, the election cannot be revoked. An amended 
return cannot be filed to change the tax credit from nonrefundable to refundable or from refundable to 
nonrefundable.  
All claims for credit, including any amended claims, 
must be filed on or before the twelfth month following the 
close of the taxable year for which the credit may be 
claimed. 
Similar to 2012 Form N -342, the accompanying 
instructions do not reflect that  nonrefundable or refundable  
elections made pursuant to HRS § 235-12.5(f)-(h) are predicated

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
on whether a taxpayer’s RETITC exceeds their tax liability. 
Again, t he threshold qualification for such elections un der 
subsections (f) -(h) is excess RETITC, yet the first sentence of 
the relevant portion of the instructions improperly states that 
“[a] taxpayer may elect to treat the tax credit as nonrefundable 
or refundable.” Accordingly, we conclude that the instructions 
are also inconsistent with HRS § 235 -12.5. 
We conclude that the ICA erred in holding that 2012 
Form N-342 and its accompanying instructions are compatible with 
HRS § 235 -12.5. Petitioners did not have excess RETITC over 
their tax l iability , and thus should not have been compelled to 
make the elections on lines 42 and 43 of the 2012 Form N -342. 
Further, the Department incorrectly reduced Petitioners’ RETITC 
by 30% in the Final Assessment , an option under HRS § 235 -
12.5(g) for refund ing excess RETITC that was inapplicable to 
Petitioners . 
We thus conclude that the ICA erred in its 
interpretation of HRS § 235 -12.5 and in its ruling that the 
Department’s Final Assessment should be affirmed. The Tax 
Appeal Court also erred in precludi ng Petitioners from receiving 
any RETITC. We conclude that Petitioners are entitled to the 
RETITC of $17,250 claimed in their 2012 income tax return.
