SCWC-24-0000540 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAIʻI 
SAMUEL CARTER, 
Petitioner/Plaintiff-Appellant, 
 
vs. 
 
HONOLULU POLICE DEPARTMENT, CITY & COUNTY OF HONOLULU; 
CHIEF OF POLICE; WINSTON HALE; JUSTIN GONSALVES; 
JORDAN REGO; KENRIC PAI; and FLORAND BLANCO, 
Respondents/Defendants-Appellees. 
CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
(CAAP-24-0000540; CASE NO. 1CCV-23-0000776) 
 
ORDER REJECTING APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., McKenna, Eddins, and Ginoza,  JJ.,  
and Circuit Judge Ashford, in place of Devens, J., recused)  
Petitioner/Plaintiff-Appellant Samuel Carter’s 
(Carter) application for writ of certiorari, filed on June 12, 
2025, and as supplemented on July 10, 2025, is hereby rejected. 
To be clear, Carter has two appeals from the same 
circuit court case, CAAP-24-0000495 and CAAP-24-0000540, because 
two notices of appeal were mailed to the Circuit Court of the 
First Circuit. But each appeal is on a different procedural         
       
 
 path because both appeals were not consolidated prior to dismissal of CAAP-24-0000540. 
For example, Carter filed an opening brief and 
jurisdiction statement in CAAP-24-0000495. An opening brief and 
jurisdiction statement were not filed in CAAP-24-0000540. 
This order and the dismissal of CAAP-24-0000540 does 
not affect the outcome of CAAP-24-0000495 because CAAP-24-
0000540 and CAAP-24-0000495 were not consolidated prior to the dismissal of CAAP-24-0000540. CAAP-24-0000495 continued to be 
pending in the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) when Carter’s 
application for writ of certiorari was filed in this case. 
Carter is directed to file documents in CAAP-24-
0000495 while that case continues to be pending in the ICA. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawaiʻ i, July 15, 2025.
