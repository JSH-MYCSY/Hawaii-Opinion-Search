OPINION OF THE COURT BY ACOBA, J.
 
We hold that (1) parents have a constitutional right to 
discipline children inhering in their liberty interest in the 
care, custody, and control of their children, under the due process clause, article 1, section 5 of the Hawai
'i Constitution, 
(2) a parent may raise the right of parental discipline in a Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 586-5 show cause hearing in 
opposition to the continuation of a temporary restraining order

(TRO) issued under HRS chapter 586 on allegations of domestic
 
abuse, (3) in such circumstances trial courts shall consider
 whether the discipline is reasonably related to the purpose of
 safeguarding or promoting the welfare of the minor in determining
 whether the parent’s conduct constituted abuse or proper
 discipline, and (4) generally a non-custodial parent retains the
 right to discipline a child when the child is under his or her
 supervision. Under the foregoing propositions, we vacate the
 September 21, 2011 judgment of the Intermediate Court of Appeals

against Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant Christy L. Lethem
 
(Petitioner) and in favor of his then-fifteen-year-old minor
 daughter, Amber J. Lethem (Minor) in an HRS chapter 586 petition
 alleging domestic abuse of Minor brought by Petitioner’s ex-wife,
 Respondent/Plaintiff-Appellee Lily E. Hamilton (Mother or
 Respondent). 
I.
 
The following essential matters, some verbatim, are
 
from the record and the submissions of the parties. 
A. 
On September 23, 2005, Mother filed an Ex Parte
 
Petition for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and Statement on
 behalf of Minor to enjoin Petitioner from contacting, calling, or
 visiting Minor pursuant to HRS chapter 586. Petitioner had
 allegedly “physically harmed, injured or assaulted” Minor by
 “slapping, punching, [and] hitting” her on August 25, 2005. 
Petitioner had also allegedly subjected Minor to extreme
 
1(...continued)
H
RS § 586-5.5 (2006 Repl.) provides in relevant part:
§ 586-5.5 Protective order; additional orders.
(a) If, after hearing all relevant evidence , the
court finds that the respondent has failed to show
cause why the order should not be continued and that a
protective order is necessary to prevent domestic
abuse or a recurrence of abuse, the court may order
that a protective order be issued for a further fixed
reasonable period as the court deems appropriate.
 
(Emphases added.)
 
HRS § 586-11 (2006 Repl.) provides in relevant part:
 
§ 586-11 Violation of an order for protection.
(a) Whenever an order for protection is granted
pursuant to this chapter, a respondent or person to be
restrained who knowingly or intentionally violates the
order for protection is guilty of a misdemeanor.

         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
psychological abuse by “showing up at [her] school unannounced,
 
putting [her] down by blaming financial problems on [her], and
 saying [that] many problems (such as work problems/emotional
 distress) [were her] fault.” The last date alleged for these
 incidents was September 16, 2005. The petition stated that Minor
 believed she was in immediate danger of being abused by
 Petitioner because “of previous actions [by Petitioner,] such as
 hitting [her] on [August 12 and August 25], showing up at [her]
 school, and verbally abusing [her] as previously stated.” 
The court granted the ex-parte TRO the same day it was
 
filed, prohibiting Petitioner from threatening Minor or anyone
 living with Minor, or contacting, writing, telephoning or
 otherwise electronically contacting Minor, and from visiting or
 remaining within 100 yards of Minor for ninety days until
 December 22, 2005. A show cause hearing was scheduled for
 October 5, 2005 pursuant to HRS § 586-5(b) as to whether the TRO
 should continue. 
At the hearing, in which Petitioner was represented by
 
counsel, Minor alleged three incidents of abuse. The first
 allegedly occurred on August 12, 2005. The day before, August
 11, 2005, Minor was scheduled to have visitation with Petitioner
 after school. Minor called Petitioner and told him that she did
 not need a ride from school because Mother was going to pick her
 up. This turned out to be a fabrication. Instead, Minor,
 another teenage girl, and two teenage boys drove to a store to
 pick up the “morning after pill” for the other girl. That
 evening, Petitioner called Mother in an attempt to locate Minor,
 
5
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
but Mother had not heard from Minor. Petitioner eventually
 
decided to drive to Mother’s house. When Petitioner reached
 Mother’s house at around 10:00 p.m., Minor had arrived and
 Petitioner took Minor back to his home. 
The next day, August 12, 2005, Petitioner and Minor
 
spoke. When Petitioner learned what Minor had done, he became
 very angry. Petitioner informed Minor that he felt she should
 have told the other girl’s parents that their daughter was
 sexually active and should have allowed them to deal with the
 situation. Minor testified that she felt she did not have to
 talk with Petitioner because she had already spoken to Mother
 about the situation. Minor related that both she and Petitioner
 were yelling. Petitioner claimed that Minor was “just ranting
 and raving,” and “screaming” at her younger sister. Minor
 testified that, at some point, Petitioner hit her. Minor claimed
 that Petitioner struck her “a couple of times” and that
 Petitioner was attempting to slap her on the face but that she
 blocked his blows. Petitioner claimed that he only tried to hit
 Minor on the shoulder because Minor had tried to leave and
 Petitioner wanted her to stay and talk to him. 
Mother was told that Minor and Petitioner were having
 
an argument and called the police. When the police arrived,
 Minor told them that she was fine and the police left. Minor had
 no bruises as a result of the incident.
 
The second incident of alleged abuse took place on
 
August 25, 2005. Minor claimed that she and Petitioner “got into 
6
         
          
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
a power struggle.” Minor had gone to Petitioner’s house that day
 
early in the evening. Petitioner wanted to speak to Minor, but
 she did not want to talk because she “had to call other friends
 to get [her] homework and [was] busy.” According to Minor,
 Petitioner wanted to discuss “how [her] day went.”
2 Minor
 
acknowledged that Petitioner waited several hours to speak with
 her. At around 11:00 p.m., Petitioner again attempted to speak
 with Minor. Minor did not want to converse and said, “Dad, I
 have school tomorrow. I’d really like to go to bed.” 
Petitioner allegedly said, “No, we talk now.” The two then began
 to argue. Minor claimed that Petitioner then hit her. She
 stated, “[A]s I was covering my head, like, he hit me on my
 arms.” Petitioner also allegedly told Minor, “Don’t make me do
 that again.” Minor then called her Mother and told her that she
 was uncomfortable staying with Petitioner.
 
The last incident of abuse allegedly took place on
 
September 16, 2005. According to Minor, Petitioner visited her
 school unannounced. The principal went to Minor’s classroom and
 said that he needed to speak to her. Once outside the classroom,
 the principal told Minor, “Your father is downstairs. We need to 
handle this now.” Minor claimed that Petitioner had been
 threatening to take her out of private school to discipline her. 
According to Minor, Petitioner began to say “how everything had
 been [her] fault,” “how [Petitioner’s] financial problems were
 [her] fault,” and how Minor’s younger sister was “better than” 
2
 This incident, thus, was apparently not related to the August 12
 
"birth control" incident.
 
7
         
        
         
      
           
     ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Minor in various ways. Minor testified that she felt Petitioner
 
was “bringing [her] down.”
 
Petitioner claimed that he was simply attempting to
 
discipline Minor. Petitioner stated that Minor was difficult at
 times, would lie to him, and refused to follow reasonable rules,
 such as not riding in a car with anyone under the age of twenty-
one. He claimed, however, that he never attempted to hit
 [Minor’s] face, that he only visited her at school twice to talk
 to her, and that he never blamed his financial problems on her.
 
At the conclusion of the hearing, the court found that
 
the TRO was warranted. The court’s reasoning rested on the
 ground that Petitioner did not have a right to discipline Minor
 because Mother had sole legal custody. The court stated that if
 Minor had been visiting Petitioner and he had “caught [her] doing
 drugs,” then Petitioner “ha[d] the right to use physical force,
 if necessary.” However, the court believed that Petitioner’s
 case was different because “we’re talking about an ongoing
 philosophy of how [parents] should run [children’s] lives . . .
 [and that,] unfortunately[,] falls with [Mother,] not
 [Petitioner].”
 
In the same vein, the court concluded that HRS § 703­
3
309, which sets forth the circumstances in which use of force by
3
 HRS § 703-309 (1993) provides in relevant part:
 
§ 703-309 Use of force by persons with special
responsibility for care, discipline, or safety of
others. The use of force upon or toward the person of
another is justifiable under the following
circumstances:

a parent is justifiable in the context of criminal prosecutions,

was relevant,  but that Petitioner could not take advantage of it
because Mother had sole legal custody of Minor. The court
 
indicated that it might read HRS § 703-309(1) to afford a baby-
sitter “certain rights” to discipline a child when it “becomes
 necessary regarding activities that happen during their [sic]
 period of care and custody,” but that it was concerned “whether
 or not what this child did was in fact something that happened
 during the period of [Petitioner’s] care and custody.”
 
There was no mention of the term abuse in the court’s
 
oral and written findings. Instead, the court stated that
 “[t]here’s no question in my mind that [Petitioner and Minor]
 
3(...continued)
(1) The actor is the parent or guardian or
other person similarly responsible for the general
care and supervision of a minor, or a person acting at
the request of the parent, guardian, or other
responsible person, and:
 
(a)	 The force is employed with due regard for the age and
size of the minor and is reasonably related to the
purpose of safeguarding or promoting the welfare of
the minor, including the prevention or punishment of
the minor's misconduct; and
 
(b)	 The force used is not designed to cause or known to
create a risk of causing substantial bodily injury,
disfigurement, extreme pain or mental distress, or
neurological damage.
 
4	 The court [orally ruled as follows]:
 
I do note the citation of 703-309, though
(inaudible) also instructed them to (inaudible) the 703­309 definition is used in criminal cases. Nevertheless,
703-309 is very instructive in civil matters.
 
There may be a question of application, but I
 
think there is some sort of relevance for 793 -- 703­309. As Petitioner’s counsel has stated on record, 703­
309A [sic] says if the actor is the parent, guardian, or
other person similarly responsible for the care and
 supervision of a minor.
 
9
         
          
           
           
   
          
            
            
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
still love each other, and they do have and should have an
 
ongoing relationship.” The court stated, however, that it was
 
5
“struck . . . by Section 4(a)(3)  . . . [and] really [had] no
choice but to make a finding that what happened in this [case]
 was not parental discipline.” From the context, it appears that
 the court was under the impression that because Mother had sole
 legal custody, Petitioner was not permitted to discipline Minor
 on the occasions alleged by Minor.
 
On November 3, 2005, Petitioner filed his notice of
 
appeal. 
On March 3, 2006, at Petitioner’s request, the court
 
entered its findings of fact (findings) and conclusions of law
 (conclusions). In its findings, the court only discussed the
 August 25 incident in which Petitioner had struck Minor at around
 11:00 p.m. after she refused to speak to him about the apparent
 birth control incident.
6 The court did not mention the other two
 
incidents. Additionally, in its written decision, the court
 concluded that HRS § 703-309(a) had no application to
 Petitioner’s case because that section only applied to criminal
 cases. The court also concluded that the responsibility to
 discipline was Mother’s only, as the sole legal custodian, but
 that in any event, “[a]ssuming . . . [Petitioner] struck [Minor]
 because of her refusal to discuss [the birth control] issue late
 
5
 The court was apparently referring to Section IV.A.3 of the TRO
 
application, in which Minor placed a checkmark next to the box stating
“[Petitioner] has physically harmed, injured or assaulted me by: . . .
slapping, punching, hitting me.”
 
6
 The court apparently confused the dates. The testimony at the
 
hearing was that the "morning-after pill" incident took place on August 12.
The incident that took place on August 25 was, according to Minor's testimony
at the hearing, unrelated to the August 12 incident.
 
10
         
 
         
             
    
       
       
         
             
           
           
            
             
              
           
            
           
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
during a school night, the court concludes that such an action is
 
not proper parental discipline.”
 
B.
 
On appeal before the ICA, Petitioner represented
 
himself. He argued that (1) chapter 586 violated his right to
 
7
discipline his children;  (2) chapter 586 ran afoul of procedural
8 9
 due process protections;  (3) chapter 586 was gender-biased, and
(4) the court abused its discretion in concluding that a TRO was
 warranted under the circumstances.
10
 
The ICA held, in an unpublished May 16, 2008
 
disposition, that Petitioner’s case was moot because the TRO had
 expired by its own terms on December 22, 2005. Hamilton v.
 
Lethem, No. 27580, 2008 WL 2069780 (App. May 16, 2008 (SDO))
 [hereinafter Hamilton I]. Judge Foley dissented, explaining that
 because the appeal was moot, he would dismiss it rather than
 vacate it, as the majority had done. Id. This court vacated,
 
adopting the collateral consequences exception to the mootness
 doctrine, and concluding that Petitioner’s case fell under that
 
7 Mother, who was the Plaintiff-Appellee before the ICA, argued that
 
because she was the sole legal custodian, she had the sole right to determine
how Minor should be disciplined.
 
8 Mother did not respond to this argument.
 
9
 Mother did not respond to this argument.
 
10
 On appeal, Mother had argued that because Petitioner qualified the 
ex parte petition as “bogus” and failed to attach the transcript of the showcause hearing, the only source of facts was the court’s findings andconclusions, which could not be deemed erroneous. Mother did not address Petitioner’s argument on the merits. However, as noted, infra, after the ICA
concluded that the appeal was moot, this court remanded for a decision on themerits. See Hamilton v. Lethem , 119 Hawai 'i 1, 12, 193 P.3d 839, 850 (2008) 
[hereinafter, Hamilton II ]. On remand, the ICA considered the transcript and
the family court’s findings and conclusions. See Hamilton v. Lethem , No.
27580, 2011 WL 2611284, at *8 n.9, *14 (App. Jun. 30, 2011)[hereinafter,Hamilton III ].

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
exception because there was a reasonable likelihood that the
 
issuance of the TRO would harm Petitioner’s reputation, and
 remanded to the ICA to address the merits. Hamilton v. Lethem,
 
119 Hawai' i 1, 12, 193 P.3d 839, 850 (2008) [hereinafter Hamilton 
II]. As noted by Petitioner, this court stated, 
[T]he TRO was issued by the family court based upon its
express ruling that [Petitioner] did physically harm,
injure[] or assault [Minor]. Such ruling implies that
 [Petitioner] is a child abuser and is, therefore,
 potentially dangerous, thereby undermining his
 reputation and standing in the community. Additionally
. . . the issuance of the TRO against [Petitioner] did
not require him to register in a public database;
however, the TRO, once issued, became part of the public
record. As such, there is a reasonable possibility that
[p]otential employers and landlords [might be] reluctant
to employ or rent to [Petitioner] once they learn of his
status as a [‘child abuser’]. Indeed, pursuant to HRS
chapter 586, any TRO issued under such chapter must be
copied to the appropriate law enforcement agency, HRS §
586-10 (2006), and reported to the department of human
services for investigation, HRS § 586-10.5 (2006).
 Thus, the issuance of the TRO could also adversely
affect [Petitioner]'s personal and professional life,
employability, associations with neighbors, [and] choice
of housing.
 
Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). This court
 
“vacate[d] the ICA’s June 23, 2008 judgment on appeal and
 remand[ed] the case to the ICA with instructions to address the
 merits of [Petitioner’s] case.” Id.
 
C. 
On remand, without further briefing or argument, the
 
ICA held that HRS chapter 586, which empowers the family court to
 grant a TRO in cases of domestic abuse, did not violate the
 procedural or substantive due process guarantees of the
 Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution or of 
article 1, section 5 of the Hawai' i Constitution because parents

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
do not have a right to abuse their children. Hamilton III, 2011
 
WL 2611284, at *5-13 (App. Jun. 30, 2011). As to Petitioner’s
 
contention that the process for obtaining an ex parte TRO was
 unconstitutionally gender-biased, the ICA found that Petitioner
 waived the point by failing to argue it. See id. at *14. 
Lastly, the ICA concluded that the court had not abused its
 discretion in issuing the TRO. The ICA found no clear error in
 the court’s finding that Petitioner had struck Minor and ruled
 that it was “implicit in the [family court’s] findings that
 [Petitioner’s] actions were not reasonably calculated to promote
 Minor’s welfare.” Id. at *14-15. 
II.
 
Petitioner, now represented by counsel, lists the
 
following questions in his Application:
 
1. When determining whether to issue a TRO, does
the parental right to discipline children require the
application of clear and articulable guidelines to
distinguish truly abusive behavior from actions that
are “moderate or reasonable discipline [that] is often
part and parcel of the real world of parenting?”
 
2. When considering whether to issue a TRO, must
the Family Court recognize that a non-custodial parent
maintains a “residual parental right” to discipline
his[/her] child during a period of unsupervised
visitation, including the right to discipline the
child for morals?
 
Respondent did not file a Response to the Application.  
III. 
As to the first question, Petitioner contends that (1) 
parents have a fundamental right to discipline their children 
under the United States and Hawai' i constitutions that includes a 
right to employ corporal punishment; (2) the ICA incorrectly dismissed Petitioner’s argument because it concluded that (a) the 
13
         
         
           
     ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
criminal statutory defense does not expressly apply in a civil
 
setting, and (b) the definition of “domestic abuse” under HRS §
 586-1 encompasses conduct that might otherwise satisfy the
 parental discipline defense; (3) the only way for a parent to
 distinguish discipline from abuse is to have clearly established
 standards; (4) this court’s interpretation of HRS § 703-309
 protects the right to discipline, and for a parent’s
 constitutionally protected right to discipline to mean anything,
 the same or a similar standard to the one used in the criminal
 law context must apply in the civil TRO context; (5) to protect a
 parent’s right to discipline this court must interpret “domestic
 abuse” under HRS § 586-1 to be the “same or similar”
11 to the
 
parental justification defense under HRS § 703-309; (6) the ICA
 gravely erred by failing to apply a discernible standard to
 distinguish discipline from abuse; (7) there is a potential due
 process violation because parents are left without notice as to
 what conduct constitutes abuse and courts will apply their own ad
 hoc sense of what the standards are; (8) the ICA simply assumed
 Petitioner’s conduct rose to abuse and erred in not recognizing
 Petitioner’s constitutional right to discipline. 
As to the second question, Petitioner contends that (1)
 
the ICA should have taken judicial notice of documents that
 established Petitioner’s right to discipline his daughter; (2)
 the ICA’s decision perpetuated the collateral consequences
 
11
 Petitioner’s contention is read to mean that the same standard
 
used to distinguish abuse from discipline under HRS § 703-309(1) should be
used in HRS § 586-1.
 
14
         
  
        
     ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
incident to the TRO because Petitioner’s reputation was harmed by
 
the ICA’s decision; (3) the ICA’s decision also hurt Petitioner
 because the court granted full custody of Minor to Mother as a
 result of the TRO; (4) the ICA erred in concluding that
 Petitioner did not have a right to discipline Minor; (5) it is
 well-established that parents with visitation rights retain
 authority to discipline their children during visitation.
12
 
IV. 
It is now established that parents may discipline their 
children as part of the parents’ liberty interest in the care, custody, and control of their children. “[T]he interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children . . . is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by [the United States Supreme Court].” In re Doe, 99 
Hawai'i 522, 532, 57 P.3d 447, 457 (2002) (citing Troxel v. 
Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65 (2000)). The Court has not been squarely presented with the question whether the right to care for children also includes a right to use corporal punishment to discipline them. See Sweaney v. Ada County, Idaho, 119 F.3d 
1385, 1391 (9th Cir. 1997) (holding that there is no clearly established federal constitutional right of a parent to inflict corporal punishment on a child). However, the Court has decided a number of cases that suggest it would recognize a parent’s right to use corporal punishment. See Troxel, 530 U.S. at 65 
(plurality opinion) (“[T]he [constitutional] liberty [interest] 
12
 Petitioner’s arguments are presented in an order different from
 
that in which Petitioner made them.
 
15
         
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
of parents and guardians includes the right to direct the
 
upbringing and education of children under their control[.])
 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); Parham v. J.
 R., 442 U.S. 584, 602 (1979) (“Our jurisprudence historically has
 reflected Western civilization concepts of the family as a unit
 with broad parental authority over minor children.”); Ingraham v.
 Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 661, 670 (1977) (suggesting that parents
 are privileged to use force to discipline their children inasmuch
 as the Court observed that the prevalent rule in this country
 today permits teachers to use “such force as [the] teacher . . .
 
reasonably believes to be necessary for (the child’s) proper
 
control, training, or education”) (internal quotation marks and
 citations omitted). 
Additionally, “Independent of the federal constitution 
. . . parents have a substantive liberty interest in the care, custody, and control of their children protected by the due process clause of article 1, section 5 of the Hawai' i 
Constitution.” In re Doe, 99 Hawai' i at 533, 57 P.3d at 458. It 
is well-established that imposing discipline is part and parcel of caring for children, since a parent may not be able to care properly for, or exercise control over, an unruly child without the ability to impose discipline. See Ingraham, 430 U.S. at 661. 
Such discipline has included corporal punishment. See id. 
(“Professional and public opinion is sharply divided on the practice [of corporal punishment], and has been for more than a century. Yet we can discern no trend toward its elimination.”); State v. Crouser, 81 Hawai' i 5, 14, 911 P.2d 725, 734 (1996) 
16
         
 
         
           
             
          
        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
(explaining, for purposes of criminal liability, that it is 
“well-established,” in Hawai' i, “that parents have a privilege to 
subject children to reasonable corporal punishment”). The right to discipline is therefore inherent in the right to care, custody, and control of one’s children, as guaranteed by the Hawai'i Constitution.

V.
 A.
 
Preliminarily, the ICA distinguished the initial grant 
of the ex parte TRO from the show cause hearing. Hamilton III, 
2011 WL 2611284, at *8-13. The ICA concluded that the procedures that permit a court to grant an ex parte TRO under chapter 586 comport with due process. Id. (citing, for example, In re 
Guardianship of Carlsmith, 113 Hawai' i 236, 239-40, 151 P.3d 717, 
720-21 (2007)). 
When a petitioner first applies for a TRO ex parte, a 
court must find that there is probable cause to believe that “a past act or acts of abuse have occurred, or that threats of abuse make it probable that acts of abuse may be imminent.” HRS § 586­4(c). Within fifteen days after the TRO is entered, a court is required to hold a show cause hearing to determine whether the TRO should remain in force. HRS § 586-5(b); see Styke v. Sotelo, 122 Hawai' i 485, 491, 228 P.3d 365, 371 (App. 2010) (“We hold 
that under HRS § 586-5(b), the court is obligated to hold a show­
13
 Rights grounded in the Hawai 'i Constitution may be broader in 
scope than rights grounded in the United States Constitution. See, e.g.,
State v. Dixon , 83 Hawai 'i 13, 23, 924 P.2d 181, 191 (1996) (stating that
“article I, section 7 of the Hawai 'i Constitution provides broader protection
than the [F]ourth [A]mendment to the United States Constitution”). 
17
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
cause hearing on a TRO within fifteen days from the date the TRO
 
is granted (where service has been effected) unless there is a
 substantial reason amounting to good cause for a delay.”); Kie v.
 McMahel, 91 Hawai i 438, 441-42, 984 P.2d 1264, 1267-68 (App.
 1999) (noting that under HRS § 586-5(b) the court must hold a
 show cause hearing no later than fifteen days from the date the
 TRO is granted). During that hearing, the petitioner has the
 burden to prove the allegations in the petition by a
 preponderance of the evidence. Id. at 442-43, 984 P.2d at 1268­
69. 
The existence of exigent circumstances justifies 
dispensing with the requirement of holding a hearing before the ex parte TRO is granted. Cf. In re Guardianship of Carlsmith, 
113 Hawai' i at 238-42, 151 P.3d at 720-23 (“TRO[s], in view of 
[their] emergency remedial nature, may [constitutionally] be granted ex parte[,]”) ([alteration] in original,) (Citing Luat v. Cacho, 92 Hawai' i 330, 346, 991 P.2d 840, 856 (App. 1999)). The 
availability of a prompt post-deprivation hearing (by way of a show cause hearing), combined with the fact that the petitioner retains the burden of proof during the hearing, ensures that the respondent’s interests are adequately protected. See id. 
(upholding constitutionality of ex parte TROs issued under Hawai'i Family Court Rules Rule 65(b) where adverse party is 
allowed to request post-deprivation hearing); Kie, 91 Hawai' i at 
442, 984 P.2d at 1268 ("While at that hearing the respondent must ‘show cause why’ the protective order is not necessary, HRS § 586-5.5(a), the burden remains on the petitioner to prove the 
18
         
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
petitioner's underlying allegations by a preponderance of the 
evidence."); Coyle v. Compton, 85 Hawai' i 197, 207, 940 P.2d 404, 
414 (App. 1997) (upholding issuance of an ex parte TRO in a domestic abuse situation against due process challenge). The ICA therefore correctly concluded that the procedure for obtaining an ex parte TRO under chapter 586 comports with due process. See 
Hamilton III, 2011 WL 2611284, at *8-13. Petitioner apparently does not quarrel with that conclusion in his Application. 
B. 
Petitioner argues, however, that at the show cause
 
hearing, there must be a standard by which courts can distinguish
 abuse from discipline. The ICA concluded that chapter 586 did
 not infringe upon Petitioner’s right to discipline his children
 because that chapter only reaches abuse. Id. at *6. But the ICA
 
did not articulate what differentiates abuse from discipline or
 what factors courts should consider in determining whether abuse
 or discipline is involved.
 
Due process requires that the State provide meaningful 
standards to guide the application of its laws. Cf. Kolender v. 
Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 358 (1983). Statutes must be defined “with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited.” State v. Beltran, 116 Hawai' i 146, 151, 
172 P.3d 458, 463 (2007). Further, a law that “impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis,” carries “the 
attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.” 
19
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108-109 (U.S. 1972); 
Beltran, 16 Hawai' i at 153, 172 P.3d at 465 (2007) (same). 
As Petitioner contends, without some way of
 
distinguishing abuse from discipline, there is a danger that
 chapter 586 will infringe on the right to discipline by ensnaring
 parents who use corporal punishment properly to discipline their
 children, see id. at 151, 172 P.3d at 463 (explaining that laws
 must be sufficiently clear to allow the public to distinguish
 between lawful and unlawful conduct), and that parents, as a
 result, will refrain from disciplining their children for fear of
 being subject to a TRO, cf. Brown v. Entm’t Merchants Ass’n, 131
 S. Ct. 2729, 2743 (2011) (Alito, J., concurring) (explaining, in context of First Amendment challenge, that due process requires laws to give fair notice, and that vague laws compel people to “steer far wider of the unlawful zone . . . than if the boundaries of forbidden areas were clearly marked”) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Absent standards to guide courts in distinguishing discipline from abuse, there is also a risk that courts will apply chapter 586 arbitrarily. See 
State v. Gaylord, 78 Hawai' i 127, 138, 198 P.2d 1167, 1178 (1995) 
(explaining that a statute will not be held unconstitutional by reason of uncertainty if any sensible construction embracing the legislative purpose may be given to the statute). 
VI.
 
A.
 
In the criminal law context, there is already a
 
standard that our courts use to determine whether a parent has

  prohibits “physically abused a child. HRS § 709-906(1) (1999)
abus[ing] a family or household member.” 
However, HRS § 703-309 
can be raised as a justification or defense against a charge 
under HRS § 709-906. See State v. Matavale
, 115 Hawai' i 149, 
158-59, 166 P.3d 322, 331-32 (2007) (plurality opinion) (“When a question of parental discipline is raised, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the parent’s . . . conduct did not come within the scope of parental discipline as prescribed in HRS § 703-309(1).”) As previously noted, under HRS § 703-309(1)(a) and (b), parents are permitted to use force against minor children so long as: 
(a)	 The force is employed with due regard for the age and
size of the minor and is reasonably related to the
purpose of safeguarding or promoting the welfare of
the minor, including the prevention or punishment of
the minor's misconduct; and
 
(b)	 The force used is not designed to cause or known to
create a risk of causing substantial bodily injury,
disfigurement, extreme pain or mental distress, or
neurological damage.
 
HRS §§ 709-906 and 703-309(1) have withstood attack on 
the ground that they lack sufficient clarity as to the level of 
force that may be used to discipline a minor. See State v. 
Stocker, 90 Hawai' i 85, 95, 976 P.2d 399, 409 (1999); Crouser, 81 
Hawai'i at 14-15, 911 P.2d at 734-35 (concluding that HRS §§ 703­
309(1) and 709-906 are not unconstitutionally vague) (same). In Crouser, this court held that, “[a]lthough the legislature has 
14
 HRS § 709-906 provides in relevant part:
 
§ 709-906. Abuse of family or household members;
penalty. (1) It shall be unlawful for any person,
singly or in concert, to physically abuse a family or
household member or to refuse compliance with the lawful
order of a police officer under subsection (4).
 
21
         
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
not exhaustively enumerated the specific injuries that would 
constitute unjustified use of force[,] . . . HRS § 703-309(1) gives the person of ordinary intelligence” notice as to the conduct that is prohibited. 81 Hawai' i at 14-15, 911 P.2d at 
734-35. Thus, “[t]he phrases (1) reasonably related to the purpose of safeguarding or promoting the welfare of the minor, (2) designed to cause or known to create a risk of causing (3)
 substantial bodily injury, and (4) extreme pain or mental
 distress” were held to be “sufficiently precise” to give parents
 notice as to the amount of force that was considered excessive. 
Id. at 15, 911 P.3d at 735. 
Crouser was reaffirmed in Matavale, which explained 
that “[i]n determining whether force is reasonable, the fact finder must consider the child’s age, the child’s stature, and the nature of the injuries inflicted.” Matavale, 115 Hawai' i at 
164, 166 P.3d at 338. In other words, the fact finder should consider “whether the force used was designed to cause or known to create a risk of causing substantial bodily injury, disfigurement, extreme pain or mental distress, or neurological damage given the child’s age and size.” Id. 
This court acknowledged that these factors were
 
“general in nature,” “place[d] a large amount of discretion with
 the courts,” and concluded there was no “bright line that
 indicates what, under all circumstances, is unreasonable or
 excessive corporal punishment.” Id. at 165-66, 166 P.3d at 338­
39. The permissible degree of force would depend on “the child’s
 
physique and age, the misconduct of the child, the nature of the
 
22
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
discipline, and all surrounding circumstances.” Id. This 
court’s decisions would also provide guidance and would “serve to 
illustrate the kind of conduct that clearly falls outside the parameters of parental discipline.” Id. at 164 n.11, 166 P.3d at 
337, n.11; see also State v. Kikuta, 125 Hawai' i 78, 90, 253 P.3d 
639, 652 (2011) (in determining whether a parent’s use of force was justified under HRS § 703-309 the trier of fact must consider the child’s physique and age, the misconduct of the child, the nature of the discipline, and all surrounding circumstances). 
B.
 
The ICA rejected Petitioner’s argument that he should
 
be allowed to assert the parental discipline justification under
 HRS § 703-309(1) as a defense to the TRO. Hamilton III, 2011 WL
 
2611284, at *7. The ICA explained that HRS § 703-309 does not
 expressly or implicitly extend to civil proceedings for domestic
 abuse. Id. The ICA implied that, in any event, the legislature
 
intended for chapter 586 to cover acts that were otherwise
 privileged under 703-309(1). Id. (“The Legislature thus intended
 
the definition of acts constituting domestic violence for
 purposes of TROs to be broader than those subjected to criminal
 liability under the penal code.”).
 
It is true that the definition of “domestic violence”
 
under HRS § 586-1 encompasses conduct broader in nature than the
 definition of physical abuse under HRS § 709-906. HRS § 586-1
 also prohibits malicious property damage and threats of
 infliction of harm, injury, or assault. See HRS § 586-1. On its 
23
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
face, HRS § 709-906 does not apply to either kind of conduct. 
Therefore, the ICA was correct to point out that HRS § 586-1
 reaches some conduct that is not criminalized under HRS § 709­906. 
The ICA also explained that the purpose of a TRO is to
 
prevent abuse rather than to punish past abuse. See Hamilton
 
III, 2011 WL 2611284, at *7 n.8, *13 n.17. The aim of chapter
 586 is to provide emergency relief from imminent harm by assuring
 a period of separation for the parties involved. See id. at *13
 
n.17 (“The Legislature has consistently affirmed the purpose of
 ex parte TROs to prevent imminent violence by ‘assuring a period
 of separation of the parties involved.’”) (quoting 1979 Haw.
 Sess. Laws, Act 168, § 1 at 345-46; S. Stand. Com. Rep. No. 3252,
 in 1998 Senate Journal, at 1314-15; H. Stand. Com. Rep. No. 578­98, in 1998 House Journal, at 1264-65; HRS § 586-4(c)). The ICA
 was therefore also correct that the goal of chapter 586 may be
 different from that of HRS § 709-906. 
However, as noted supra, the ICA also suggested that 
chapter 586 might extend to conduct for which a parent could otherwise assert the parental justification defense under HRS § 703-309. See Hamilton III, 2011 WL 2611284, at *7 n.8. 
Respectfully, the ICA was not correct to imply that chapter 586 prohibited conduct that would constitute discipline rather than abuse under HRS § 703-309. Otherwise, as Petitioner contends, “the right to discipline” would have no meaning. See Crouser, 81 
Hawai'i at 14, 911 P.2d at 734 (stating that a parent has a 
“privilege to subject children to reasonable corporal 
24
         
         
            
             
             
         
             
            
           
               
              
          
           
         
        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
punishment”). A parent would have the right to impose reasonable 
discipline in a criminal case, but could not raise the same justification in opposition to interference by the State with the parent-child relationship in a civil setting.
15 This would be an 
inconsistent result, one that the ICA has already rejected in the context of custody hearings. See Rezentes v. Rezentes, 88 
Hawai'i 200, 206, 965 P.2d 133, 139 (App. 1998) (concluding that 
“the term ‘family violence’ in HRS § 571-46(9) (1993) would not extend to the type of physical discipline of a child by his or her parent that is expressly permitted in HRS § 703-309(1) [because] the legislature would [not] sanction in one statute the use of certain physical force. . . and yet characterize in another statute the use of such force as family violence, potentially depriving a parent of custody or visitation.”).
16 
VII.
 
No standard has been announced in the civil law TRO
 
context that is parallel to the criminal law area to assist the
 public and the courts in drawing the line between abuse and
 discipline. As noted above, chapter 586 defines “domestic abuse”
 
15 Further, it should be noted that although no criminal sanctions
 
are imposed by a TRO, chapter 586 imposes criminal penalties for the violation
of a TRO. HRS § 586-11 (knowing violation of protective order is a
misdemeanor). The entry of a TRO could thus lead to criminal penalties.
 
16
 The ICA contends that Rezentes is distinguishable in part because,
 
as opposed to a custody determination "which is made after a full hearing of
 the issues" an "ex parte TRO is temporary in duration," "is intended to
 provide immediate relief," and is based on "probable cause." Hamilton III,
 2011 WL 2611284, at *7 n.8. However, the show cause hearing under HRS § 586-5
 is one that affords "a full hearing on the issues." Moreover, to hold that
proper discipline under HRS § 703-309(1) constitutes abuse under HRS 568-1
would blur the distinction between discipline and abuse and subject parents to
inconsistent requirements for the same acts by making permissible conduct
under HRS § 703-309(1) unlawful under HRS § 586-1.
 
25
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
as “physical harm, bodily injury, assault, or the threat of
 
imminent physical harm, bodily injury, or assault, extreme
 psychological abuse or malicious property damage.” HRS § 586-1. 
“Domestic abuse” is also defined as any act which would
 constitute an offense under HRS § 709-906. Id. 
In some, and perhaps even in many, cases, the terms
 
“physical harm,” “bodily injury,” and “assault” suffice to
 distinguish abuse from permissible discipline. Since any act
 that constitutes an offense under HRS § 709-906 also constitutes
 “domestic abuse” under HRS § 586-1, for all practical purposes,
 family courts may already be implicitly utilizing the factors set
 forth in HRS § 703-309(1) to distinguish abuse from discipline. 
A child’s age, stature, the nature of the force, the nature of
 any injuries, and the proportionality of the punishment to the
 child’s misconduct are the kinds of common sense considerations
 that a court might reasonably take into account in determining
 whether the force used by a parent amounts to abuse. 
However, there is nothing in chapter 586 or in the 
decisions of this court expressly recognizing a parental right to employ discipline with respect to the show cause hearing under HRS § 586-5(b) on the question of whether the TRO should be continued. As noted before, in the absence of such a standard, courts may construe chapter 586 too broadly and, in doing so, violate a parent’s constitutional right to discipline his or her child. Cf. Rezentes, 88 Hawai' i at 206, 965 P.2d at 139. 
26

VIII. 
Petitioner asks this court to hold that a parent has a
 
right to use reasonable force to discipline a child, and requests
 
that we articulate a standard that family courts may apply in
 evaluating whether a parent’s conduct amounts to abuse under
 chapter 586.24. The ICA did not squarely decide what standard
 should govern because it seemingly believed chapter 586 subsumed
 parental discipline permitted under HRS § 703-309.
17 See Hamilton
 
III, 2011 WL 2611284, at *7-8 (stating that the legislature
 intended definition of acts constituting domestic violence to be
 broader than those subjected to liability under the criminal
 code). However, it is not necessary to import the express
 provision of HRS § 703-309(1) into HRS § 586-5 TRO show cause
 hearings.
18
 
17 Although the ICA stated that the court “concluded that even if the
 
defense [in HRS § 703-309] were available,” Petitioner’s “use of force was not
 
reasonably related to safeguarding or promoting Minor’s welfare,” see Hamilton
 
III, 2011 WL 2611284, at *8, the court seemed uncertain as to the scope of HRS
§ 586-1. While not entirely clear, it appears that during the hearing, the
court believed that Petitioner was permitted to discipline Minor if she was
involved in conduct that was particularly egregious, such as using illegal
drugs, but that Petitioner could not discipline his daughter for other
misbehavior. The court also thought that HRS § 703-309(1) was “relevant,” but
 that Petitioner could not take advantage of it because Mother had sole legal
custody of Minor. In contrast, in its written conclusions, the court stated
 that it was not “proper parental discipline” for Petitioner to strike his
 daughter for “her refusal to discuss [the birth control] issue late during a
school night.” The court also stated, however, that HRS § 703-309 “applies to
 criminal[,] not civil[,] actions.” It cannot be said then that the court
 applied HRS § 703-309(1) in reaching its decision.
 
18
 In oral argument, Respondent implied that HRS § 703-301(2) (1972)
 
may prohibit a justification defense such as the parental discipline defense
under HRS § 703-309 from being imposed in civil proceedings under HRS chapter
586. That section states that “[t]he fact that conduct is justifiable under
this chapter [(HRS chapter 703)] does not abolish or impair any remedy for
such conduct which is available in any civil action.” HRS § 703-301(2).
However, generally it would appear that HRS § 703-301(2) was intended to
indicate that a justification defense does not affect remedies such as those
that might flow from civil or private wrongs resulting in tort claims. See
 
HRS § 703-301 cmt. (“For example, unreasonable conduct on the part of the
defendant might suffice for civil liability whereas criminal liability will

A. 
Reasonableness is the standard that has long been
 
employed by the states in the area of parental discipline. See
 
Doriane Lambelet Coleman, et. al., Where and How to Draw the Line
 
Between Reasonable Corporal Punishment and Abuse, 73-SPG Law &
 Contemp. Probs. 107, 137 (2010) [hereinafter, Where and How to
 Draw the Line] (“[S]tates have long provided parents with an
 exception to tort and criminal-law prohibitions against physical
 assaults when they can establish a disciplinary motive for the
 assault and when the assault itself is ‘reasonable.’ Twentieth-
century case law is thus replete with holdings like this one: ‘A
 parent has the right to punish a child within the bounds of
 moderation and reason, so long as he or she does it for the
 welfare of the child.’”) (citing cases); see also Restatement
 (Second) of Torts § 147 (1965) (based on survey of states, “[a]
 parent is privileged to apply such reasonable force or to impose
 such reasonable confinement upon his child as he reasonably
 believes is necessary for [his child’s] proper control, training,
 or education”); G.C. v. R.S., --- So.3d ---, 2011 WL 4104731, at
 
*2 (Fla. App. Sept. 16, 2011) (“The common law recognize[s] a
 parent’s right to discipline his or her child in a reasonable
 manner.”) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); State

Reasonableness is also the standard used when
 
considering whether a domestic violence injunction has been
 erroneously granted. See G.C., --- So.3d ----, 2011 WL 4104731
 
at *1-2. (holding that domestic violence injunction was not
 warranted because parents have a common law right to administer

 reasonable); Simons v. State Dep’t of Human Servs., 803 N.W.2d

 authorizing agency to remove abused children from homes that
 parents may use reasonable force to discipline their children);

(concluding that child was not “physically harmed” for purposes
 
of obtaining temporary domestic violence order when parent
 spanked child but left no bruises). 
IX. 
The formulations for determining whether a parent’s
 
conduct is reasonably related to discipline vary among the
 states, but they are more similar than not. Based on a survey of
 authorities, Restatement (Second) of Torts § 150 (1965) provides
 as follows:
 
In determining whether force or confinement is
reasonable for the control, training, or education of
a child, the following factors are to be considered:
(a)	 whether the actor is a parent;
 
(b)	 the age, sex, and physical and mental condition of the
child;
 
(c)	 the nature of his offense and his apparent motive;
 
(d)	 the influence of his example upon other children of
the same family or group;
 
(e)	 whether the force or confinement is reasonably
necessary and appropriate to compel obedience to a
proper command;
 
(f)	 whether it is disproportionate to the offense,
unnecessarily degrading, or likely to cause serious or
permanent harm.
19
 
States consider essentially the same factors. For
 
example, in Connecticut, “[i]n a substantiation of abuse hearing
 
. . . the hearing officer must determine whether the punishment
 was reasonable and whether the parent believed the punishment was
 necessary to maintain discipline or promote the child’s welfare.” 
Lovan C., 860 A.2d at 1289. “The hearing officer must assess the
 reasonableness of the punishment in light of the child’s
 misbehavior and the surrounding circumstances, including the
 parent’s motive, the type of punishment administered, the amount
 
19
 The factors are not exclusive. See Restatement (Second) of Torts
 
§ 150 (1965) cmt. a.
 
30
         
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
of force used and the child’s age, size and ability to understand
 
the punishment.” Id. Several other courts have identified
 
similar circumstances, such as “the age, size, sex, and physical
 condition of both child and parent, the nature of the child’s
 misconduct, the kind of marks or wounds inflicted on the child’s
 body, the nature of the instrument used for punishment, etc.” 
State v. Singleton, 705 P.2d 825, 827 (Wash. App. 1985) (citing
 cases). 
The factors considered by other states are coextensive 
with the test employed by Hawai' i in the context of the criminal 
parental discipline defense. We hold that the appropriate standard for family courts to apply in contested HRS chapter 586 show cause hearings is whether the parent's discipline is reasonably related to the purpose of safeguarding or promoting the welfare of the minor. In applying such a standard, the surrounding circumstances, including factors such as the nature of the misbehavior, the child’s age and size, and the nature and propriety of the force used, have been universally considered and should also guide the courts in this state. 
X.
 
Petitioner argues that the court and the ICA improperly
 
assumed that his actions constituted abuse. The ICA concluded
 that it was not an abuse of discretion, in light of the three
 incidents of abuse alleged, for the court to conclude that abuse
 had occurred. However, in its findings and conclusions the court
 based its decision only on the single incident in which Minor
 alleged that Petitioner hit her “a couple of times” and that he

was trying to slap her on the face but that she blocked his
 
blows. None of the parties or the courts had the benefit of the
 standard for parental discipline to apply, as set forth supra,
 for purposes of the October 5, 2005 HRS § 586-5 show cause
 hearing. Accordingly, the case must be remanded to the court for
 application of that standard.
20
 XI. 
In his second question, Petitioner asks this court to
 
determine whether a non-custodial parent has a residual parental
 right to discipline during unsupervised visitation. 
A. 
Initially, Petitioner contends that the ICA erred in
 
failing to take judicial notice of the documents pertaining to
 the custody case, UCCJ No. 98-0028. However, the ICA’s refusal
 to take the custodial documents into account had no bearing on
 the ICA’s decision because, as explained infra, the ICA refused
 to consider whether Petitioner retained a residual parental right
 to discipline Minor. See Hamilton III, 2011 WL 2611284, at *14
 
n.20. 
Petitioner filed a motion with this court requesting
 
that we take judicial notice of the custody case records. On
 December 7, 2011, we granted the motion with respect to Exhibit B
 
20
 It is not entirely clear whether the court concluded that
 
Petitioner struck Minor for helping her friend in the birth control incident
that Minor had already discussed with Mother, or instead because Minor was
attempting to leave when Petitioner sought to speak to her. See discussion
 supra. In any event, whether the conduct by Petitioner was appropriate
discipline in each incident should be left initially to the family court,
inasmuch as those determinations are necessarily fact-bound, and will depend
on the custodial arrangement of the parties and on the circumstances of the
particular case.

(Ex B), titled "Stipulated Order for Post-Decree Relief Re
 
Plaintiff's Motion and Affidavit for Post-Decree Relief Filed
 February 1, 1999, and Defendant's Motion and Affidavit for
 Post-Decree Relief Filed March 5, 1999," filed on September 22,
 1999, and with respect to Exhibit A (Ex A), titled "Order Re
 Defendant's Motion for Post Decree Relief Filed on 4/26/02 and
 Plaintiff's Motion for Post Decree Relief Filed on 5/17/02,"
 filed on August, 27, 2003. Taking judicial notice of the custody
 documents establishes that Petitioner had visitation rights with
 Minor even though Mother had sole legal custody.
 
B.
 
Petitioner also contends that his case is not moot. 
Although at this point Petitioner’s daughter has reached the age of eighteen and the TRO has expired, as was the case when Petitioner was last before this court, “there is [still] a ‘reasonable probability’ that the family court’s issuance of the TRO against [Petitioner], which was based on its findings and conclusions that [Petitioner] abused his daughter, will cause harm to [Petitioner’s] reputation.” Hamilton II, 119 Hawai' i at 
11, 193 P.3d at 849 (rejecting contention that Petitioner’s claim was moot after TRO expired and Mother was awarded full custody because Petitioner still had reputational interest to protect). Hence, Petitioner retains an interest in resolving whether the TRO should have been continued after the hearing.
21 
21
 Petitioner also contends that “the ICA’s errors perpetuated
 
continuing collateral consequences” because during the pendency of the TRO,
Mother was given sole legal and physical custody over Minor, which Petitioner
was unable to modify because of the TRO. Because this court has already held

C. 
Petitioner argues that the ICA erred in agreeing with
 
the court that Petitioner did not have the right to discipline
 
Minor. However, the ICA did not reach the issue. The ICA 
stated: 
[Petitioner]  also  challenges  the  Family  Court’s
conclusion  that  “discipline  over  issues  of  morals  lies
with  [Mother],  who  has  sole  legal  and  physical
custody.”   Given  our  ultimate  conclusion  that  the
 
Family  Court  did  not  abuse  its  discretion  in  issuing
the  Ex  Parte  TRO  .  .  .  we  need  not  address  this  point.
  
Hamilton III, 2011 WL 2611284, at *7 n.6. In her answering brief
 
22
  allows only the
 to the ICA, Respondent argued that HRS § 571-2custodial parent to discipline the child, and does not permit the
 non-custodial parent to impose discipline. In oral argument,
 Respondent also referred to the provisions of the custody
 
21(...continued)
that the reputational consequences of the grant of the TRO were sufficient to
prevent the case from becoming moot, see Hamilton II , 119 Hawai 'i at 11, 193
P.3d at 849, there is no need for this court to consider Petitioner’s argumentthat the TRO also made it impossible for him to modify the award of custody toMother. 
22 HRS § 571-2 (1993) entitled “Definitions,” provides in relevant
 
part as follows:
 
“Legal custody ” means the relationship created by
the court’s decree which imposes on the custodian the
responsibility of physical possession of the minor and
the duty to protect, train, and discipline the minor and
to provide the minor with food, shelter, education, and
ordinary  m
 edical  care, all subject to residual parental
r
ights and responsibilities and the rights and
 
re
sponsibilities of any legally appointed guardian of
the person.
 
. . . .
 
“Residual parental rights and responsibilities”
means those rights and responsibilities remaining with
the parent after the transfer of legal custody or
 guardianship of the person, including,  b
 ut  not
 
necessarily limited to, the right to reasonable
 vi
sitation, consent to adoption or marriage, and the
 
responsibility for support.

              ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
documents for this proposition.23 Respondent argued that because
 
the term “legal custody” is defined to include the responsibility
 
to discipline, and the term “residual parental right” does not, a
 non-custodial parent with residual parental rights does not enjoy
 the right to discipline. 
However, Respondent’s argument was already considered 
and subsumed in Stocker, 90 Hawai' i at 93-94, 976 P.2d at 407-08. 
The Stocker court held that a “‘custodial’ parent normally has reserved to him or her the sole authority and duty to ‘discipline’ a child,” pursuant to HRS § 571-2. Id. This court 
recognized that the definition of “residual parental rights” in HRS § 571-2 did not expressly include the right to discipline, but explained that the rights listed in the definition were not exclusive. Id. Therefore, Stocker held that a non-custodial 
parent, “acting within his court-prescribed unsupervised visitation time, retains [a] ‘residual parental right’ . . . to discipline a child with respect to that child’s conduct during the visitation period.” Id. at 94, 976 P.2d at 408 (internal 
citation omitted). Consequently, “[a] contrary holding would lead to the absurdity that a non-custodial parent, alone with his child during an authorized visitation period, would be powerless 
23
 Respondent referred to provisions (1) in Ex A, which states that 
Respondent “shall have sole legal custody of the children," and that 
"[Respondent shall consult with [Petitioner] on all legal custody decisions,”and (2) in Ex B that "[for] major decisions . . . the parties shall confer inunity . . . including . . . the manner in which the children shall bedisciplined . . . [and] the visitation schedule for [Petitioner]." On their faces, nothing in these provisions governed the particular circumstances ofthe events of August 25, 2005, nor directly conflicted with the provisionunder HRS § 571-2, that Petitioner “retain[ed] as a ‘residual parental right,’. . . the authority to discipline a child with respect to that child's conductduring the visitation period.” Stocker , 90 Hawai 'i at 94, 976 P.2d at 408. 
35
         
  
  
        
          
    ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
to employ the use of force against the child, even if such force
 
were reasonably necessary to ‘promote’ the child’s ‘welfare.’” 
Id. 
Stocker was decided in the context of the parental
 
discipline defense under HRS § 703-309(1), but the rationale
 applies equally here. It would be inconsistent to say that a
 non-custodial parent retains the right to use reasonable force to
 discipline a child for purposes of a criminal prosecution but not
 for purposes of a civil proceeding. Parents with visitation
 rights are responsible for the supervision of their children
 while the child is with them. See id. Consequently, the
 
responsibility to supervise must also include the ability to
 discipline the child when the child is in the physical custody of
 the parent--whether the parent has full legal custody or 
visitation rights. See id. In this case, no party before the
 
court disputed that Petitioner had visitation rights with Minor. 
Yet the court was unsure of whether Petitioner had the right to
 discipline Minor. We conclude that a non-custodial parent
 retains the right to discipline his or her child for conduct that
 occurs while the child is under the supervision of the non-
custodial parent.
24
 
24
 However, the family court retains discretion in any particular
 
case to specifically prohibit corporal punishment by a non-custodial parent as
the circumstances may reasonably warrant.
