RECKTENWALD, C.J., NAKAYAMA, ACOBA, DUFFY, AND McKENNA JJ.

OPINION OF THE COURT BY DUFFY, J.

Defendant-Appellant Aldo Macapal Jaylo (Father)

presents this court with a case of first impression: 
whether

   
       *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) section 580-47(a) authorized the 
family court to order educational support for a disabled but 
competent child age 23 or older when the 2004 Family Court’s Amended Child Support Guidelines (2004 Guidelines) established pursuant to HRS § 576D-7 provided that such support may be continued only until the child attains the age of 23. The family court answered this question “Yes”.
1 We agree, for the reasons 
discussed herein. 
I. BACKGROUND

This case arose from the divorce between Father and

Plaintiff-Appellee Rosemarie Aguirre Jaylo (Mother). The parties
 
married in 1980 and had three children, including twin daughters

born on April 14, 1980. One of the twins (Daughter) has been
 
blind since birth, and it is her educational support which is at

issue in this case. The parties were divorced in 1996 pursuant

to the terms of the July 29, 1996 Decree Granting Absolute

Divorce and Awarding Child Custody (Divorce Decree). The Divorce

Decree awarded Mother full legal and physical custody over the

minor children, and Father was ordered to pay child support until

each of the children reached the age of 18, or graduated from

high school, or discontinued high school, whichever occurred

last. Father was additionally ordered to provide child support

for each child as long as they continued post-high school

education, until graduation, or until the child attained the age

of 23, whichever occurred first. 
 A. Mother’s Post-Decree Motion to Reestablish Child Support.

On May 24, 2005, Mother filed a post-decree motion,

which is the subject of this appeal. In her motion, Mother
 
sought, inter alia, an order reestablishing educational support

for the parties’ Daughter, who was 25-years old at the time the

motion was filed, and pursuing a college education. A trial was

held on September 9, 2005. The family court made the following
 
relevant findings of fact and conclusions of law:

FINDINGS OF FACT
 
. . .
 
2. Pursuant to the [Divorce Decree], Father was obligated
to pay child support for the parties’ three minor
 
children[.] . . .
 
3. Father’s child support obligation set forth in the
[Divorce Decree] was to continue uninterrupted so long as
each child continues his education post high school on a
full-time basis at an accredited college or university, or
in a vocational or trade school and shall continue until
 
each child’s graduation or attainment at the age of 23
years, whichever event shall first occur.
 
. . .
 
6. The parties’ daughter, [Daughter], was 25 years old at
the time of the trial in this matter. [Daughter] is legally
blind based on her absolute lack of light perception in both
 
eyes.
 
7. [Daughter] completed her high school education at
Washington State School for the Blind in the Spring of 2000
[at the age of twenty].
 
8. [Daughter] entered a six-month program funded by the
Washington State Department of Services for the Blind, the
purpose of which was to assist blind students such as her to
learn to live independently.

     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
9. After completing the foregoing program in July 2001,
[Daughter] pursued her college education by enrolling at
Edmonds College in Lynnwood, Washington . . . .
 
10. [Daughter] then transferred to Seattle Central
Community College in Seattle, Washington . . . .
 
. . .
 
17. [Daughter] . . . has an uncovered need of $834.00 per
month, which in the past has been paid by Mother.
 
. . .
 
21. Mother and Father’s combined monthly gross income is
$9,773.00 per month, of which 37% is attributable to Mother,
and 63% is attributable to Father.
 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
 
. . .
 
23. Hawai'i Revised Statutes Section 577-7(a) provides, in
pertinent part, that “[a]ll parents and guardians shall
provide, to the best of their abilities, for the discipline,support, and education of their children.” 
24. Hawai'i Revised Statutes Section 580-47(a) provides
with respect to child support that [the] “[p]rovision may be
made for the support, maintenance, and education of an adultor minor child and for the support, maintenance, andeducation of an incompetent adult child whether or not thepetition is made before or after the child has attained theage of majority. 
25. In addition to the foregoing, the Court has continuing
jurisdiction over the issues of child support and the
children’s post high school, higher educational expenses, as
such continuing jurisdiction was specifically reserved in
the [Divorce Decree].
 
26. Applying the gross incomes of the parties to the
applicable child support guidelines, Father’s child support
obligation would be $660.00 per month, and Mother’s child
support obligation would be $390.00 per month. However,
this Court concludes that [Daughter’s] receipt of her own
income of $625.00 per month is an exceptional circumstance
warranting deviation from the parties’ child support
obligation under the child support guidelines.
 
27. Accordingly, the Court concludes that [Daughter’s]
current reasonable monthly need is $834.00 per month, and
that good cause exists to require Father to be responsible
to pay 63% ($525.42 per month) and Mother to be responsible
to pay 37% (308.58 per month), based on their proportionate
incomes . . . .

        *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
28. Mother’s and Father’s obligations to pay child support
for [Daughter] shall remain in full force and effect for a
limited time, so long as [Daughter] is pursuing a bachelor’s
degree and continuing at the maximum amount of courses
prescribed by her college, taking into account her
disability.
 
On March 6, 2006, the family court entered an order

granting in part Mother’s post-decree motion insofar as it

reestablished educational support for Daughter. Father filed a

notice of appeal on March 31, 2006. 
 B. Appeal to the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA). 
 
Father filed his opening brief to the ICA on

January 10, 2007, and argued, inter alia, that the family court’s

conclusions of law were incorrect because the family court “does

not have continuing jurisdiction or legal authority to order

child support for an adult child, over the age of 23 who is not

incompetent.” The ICA concluded that the 2004 Guidelines did not

categorically prohibit the award of educational support to an

adult child beyond the age of 23. Op. at 25. The ICA stated

that although the 2004 Guidelines permitted educational support

for an adult child enrolled as a full-time student until that

child attained the age of 23, the Guidelines further recognized

that the presence of “exceptional circumstances” could justify

the family court’s deviation from the age cap and order support

for adult children over the age of 23. Id. at 26. The ICA

stated that it

[does] not read the 2004 Guidelines to allow for the greater
expenses of a disabled child younger than twenty-three but
 
5

   
           
       
          
        
    
          
     
  
          
     
       
       
    
        
     
      
        
       
          
         
      
        *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
to forbid support to the same child because he or she could
not, because of their disability, complete their education
within the standard four years. We therefore hold that the
 
family court could find that an adult child’s physical
disability constitutes exceptional circumstances resulting
in a child support award to that disabled adult child beyond
the age of twenty-three .

. . .
 
However, on this record, it is unclear that the family court
considered Daughter’s disability an exceptional circumstance
that excused application of the twenty-three year-old age
limit.
 
Id. at 28, 29-30 (emphasis added). Thus, the ICA concluded that
 
where there is a finding of “exceptional circumstances,” the

family court has the authority to order a parent to provide 
 educational support for his or her child who is beyond the age of

23. The ICA remanded for: (1) findings on the issue of whether

Mother has proved “exceptional circumstances” warranting

deviation from the age limit on support for an adult child beyond

the age of 23 and, if so, (2) the amount and duration of support. 
 
Father’s Application for Writ of Certiorari was granted

on July 8, 2011. Oral argument was held on September 1, 2011. 
 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW

A. Statutory Interpretation

Questions of statutory interpretation are questions of law
reviewed de novo.
 
In our review of questions of statutory interpretation, this
court follows certain well-established principles, as
follows:
 
First, the fundamental starting point for statutory
interpretation is the language of the statute itself.
Second, where the statutory language is plain and
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain
and obvious meaning. Third, implicit in the task of
statutory construction is our foremost obligation to
ascertain and give effect to the intention of the

   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the
language contained in the statute itself. Fourth, when
there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness
or uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, an
ambiguity exists. And fifth, in construing an ambiguous
statute, the meaning of the ambiguous words may be sought by
examining the context, with which the ambiguous words,
phrases, and sentences may be compared, in order to
ascertain their true meaning.
 
State v. Silver, 125 Hawai' i 1, 4, 249 P.3d 1141, 1144 
(2011)(internal citations and quotation marks omitted)(quoting

Haw. Gov’t Employees Ass’n, AFSCME Local 152, AFL-CIO v. Lingle,

124 Hawai' i 197, 202, 239 P.3d 1, 6 (2010)). 
B. Family Court’s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law

Generally, the family court possesses wide discretion

in making its decisions, and these decisions will not be set

aside unless there is a manifest abuse of discretion. Fisher v.

Fisher, 111 Hawai' i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006). 
The family court’s [findings of fact] are reviewed on appeal
under the “clearly erroneous” standard. A [finding of fact]
is erroneous when (1) the record lacks substantial evidence
to support the finding, or (2) despite substantial evidence
in support of the finding, the appellate court is
nonetheless left with a definite and firm conviction that a
 
mistake has been made. “Substantial evidence” is credible
 
evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value
to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a
conclusion.
 
On the other hand, the family court’s [conclusions of law]
are reviewed on appeal de novo, under the right/wrong
standard. [Conclusions of law], consequently, are not
binding upon an appellate court and are freely reviewable
for their correctness.

III. DISCUSSION

A.		HRS Section 580-47(a) Authorizes the Family Court to Order
Educational Support for a Disabled But Competent Child Age
23 or Older.

HRS § 580-47(a) gives the family court broad authority

to make “just and equitable” orders compelling a parent “to

provide for the support, maintenance, and education of the

children of the parties.” 
 
§ 580-47 Support orders ; division of property. (a)
Upon granting a divorce , or thereafter if, in addition to
the powers granted in subsections (c) and (d), jurisdiction
of those matters is reserved under the decree by agreement
of both parties or by order of court after finding that good
cause exists, the court may make any further orders as shall
appear just and equitable (1) compelling the parties or
either of them to provide for the support, maintenance, and
education of the children of the parties [.]
 
HRS § 580-47(a) (2006). The statutory language of HRS § 580­
47(a) does not contain any age limit on the family court’s broad

authority to make “just and equitable” orders compelling a parent

to provide educational support for his/her child. Father

acknowledges the absence of such a statutory age limitation, but

bases his argument for the age limitation of 23 on four primary

grounds: (1) ICA case law, (2) the 2004 Guidelines, (3) the
 
legislative history of amendments to HRS § 580-47, and (4) the

legislature’s failure to act in response to the ICA case law

shows that the legislature tacitly approved the ICA decisions,

giving them the effect of legislation. We will discuss each of

these arguments in turn.

      *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
B. ICA Case Law

Father cites footnote 3 in Nabarrete v. Nabarrete, 86

Hawai'i 368 (App. 1997): 
3. An adult-student-son/daughter is defined as a son or
daughter who is under age 23 and attending college or
another post-high school educational institution on a full
time basis. Mack v. Mack , 7 Haw. App. 171, 180, 749 P.2d
478, 483 (1988).
 
Nabarrete, 86 Hawai' i at 371 n.3, 949 P.2d at 211 n.3. There is 
no discussion in Nabarrete regarding HRS § 580-47(a). 
 
With respect to the Mack case, cited in footnote 3 in

Nabarrete as the source of the age limitation of 23 for

educational support, HRS § 580-47 is mentioned but there is no

discussion regarding the source of the age 23 limitation on

educational support: 
 
In his answering brief father states in relevant part as
follows: “[T]he support duty owed by Husband to Laura and
Danielle is far different from the duty owed to them when
they were minors.” We disagree. Under HRS § 580-47 (1985)
and the May 13, 1982 consent decree of divorce, the duty
owed by Father to Laura and Danielle since they became
adults and while they are under age 23 and attending college
or another post-high school educational institution on a
full time basis is basically the same as it was when they
were minors. (Emphasis added).
 
Mack, 7 Haw. App. at 180, 749 P.2d at 483. The cited ICA case

law is not persuasive as it does not inform us of the source of

the purported age limitation of 23 for educational support, and

is contrary to the broad discretion given the family court in

HRS § 580-47(a).

     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
C.		2004 Guidelines

Section E of the 2004 Guidelines expressly states,

inter alia: “Support for an adult child who is a full-time

student may continue until the child attains the age of 23.” 
 
The origin of the 2004 Guidelines is found in

HRS § 580-47(a): 
 
In establishing the amounts of child support , the court
shall use the guidelines established under section 576D-7.
Provision may be made for the support, maintenance, and
education of an adult or minor child and for the support,
maintenance, and education of an incompetent adult child
whether or not the petition is made before or after the
child has attained the age of majority.
 
HRS § 580-47(a) (2006) (emphasis added). 
 
HRS § 576D-7 is entitled “Guidelines in establishing

amount of child support” and provides as follows: 
 
(a) The family court, in consultation with 
the the
agency, shall establish guidelines to establish 
 amount
of  child  support  when  an  order  for  support  is  sought  or
being  modified  under  this  chapter.  The  guidelines  shall  be
based  on  specific  descriptive  and  numeric  criteria  and
result  in  a  computation  of  the  support  obligation.
T
he guidelines may include consideration of the
following:
(1)	 	All earnings, income, and resources of both parents;
provided that earnings be the net amount, after
deductions for taxes, and social security. Overtime
and cost of living allowance may be deducted where
appropriate;
 
(2)	 	The earning potential, reasonable necessities, and
borrowing capacity of both parents;
 
(3)	 	The needs of the child for whom support is sought;
 
(4)	 	The amount of public assistance which would be paid
for the child under the full standard of need as
 
established by the department;
 
(5)	 	The existence of other dependents of the obligor
parent;
 
(6)	 	To foster incentives for both parents to work;
 
(7)	 	To balance the standard of living of both parents and
child and avoid placing any below the poverty level
whenever possible;
 
(8)	 	To avoid extreme and inequitable changes in either
parent's income depending on custody; and
 
10

   
         
       
         
        
        
   
 
       
         
        
        
        
 
     
        
        
        
       
         
        
          
        
         
         
           
        
          
 
       
          
          
           
         
         
        
          
          
          
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(9)	 	If any obligee parent (with a school age child or
children in school), who is mentally and physically
able to work, remains at home and does not work,
thirty (or less) hours of weekly earnings at the
minimum wage may be imputed to that parent's income.
 
(b)	 	The guidelines shall be:
 
(1)	 	Applied statewide;
 
(2)	 	To simplify the calculations as much as practicable;
 
(3)	 	Applied to ensure, at a minimum, that the child for
whom support is sought benefits from the income and
resources of the obligor parent on an equitable basis
in comparison with any other minor child of the
obligor parent;
 
(4)	 	Established by October 1, 1986; and
 
(5)	 	Transmitted to the agency and all family court judges
when available or updated, and shall be considered by
the judges in the establishment of each child support
order.
 
(c) The family court, in consultation with the agency,
shall update the guidelines at least once every four years.
(d) The establishment of the guidelines or the adoption of
any modifications made to the guidelines set forth in this section
may constitute a change in circumstances sufficient to permit
review of the support order. A material change of circumstances
will be presumed if support as calculated pursuant to the
guidelines is either ten per cent greater or less than the support
amount in the outstanding support order. The most current
guidelines shall be used to calculate the amount of the child
support obligation.
(e) The responsible or custodial parent for which child
support has previously been ordered shall have a right to petition
the family court or the child support enforcement agency not more
than once every three years for review and adjustment of the child
support order without having to show a change in circumstances.
The responsible or custodial parent shall not be precluded from
petitioning the family court or the child support enforcement
agency for review and adjustment of the child support order more
than once in any three-year period if the second or subsequent
request is supported by proof of a substantial or material change
of circumstances.
 
HRS § 576D-7 (2006) (emphasis added). It is clear from the

statutory language of HRS § 580-47(a) and HRS § 576D-7 that the

guidelines were intended to establish the amount of child support

rather than to establish the child’s eligibility for such

support. To the extent that the 2004 Guidelines purport to set
 
an age limitation of 23 on the family court’s authority to

continue educational support for an adult child, they are invalid

11

   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
as they exceed the statutory mandate of HRS § 580-47(a) when they 
purport to limit eligibility for such support. Where there well may be valid policy reasons to support a statutory age limitation of 23 (or other age) for educational support, the imposition of eligibility requirements for educational support is a policy determination within the purview of the legislature, and HRS § 580-47(a) imposes no such age limitation. As Father 
candidly admitted, “the legislature cannot delegate the authority 
to establish or amend the eligibility criteria for child support 
that are set forth in HRS § 580-47(a) because it cannot delegate its legislative authority.” Hawaii Insurers Council v. Lingle, 
120 Hawai' i 51, 69-70 (2008). 
The 2004 Guidelines thus do not support Father’s

argument for the age limitation of 23 for educational support. 
 D. Legislative History of Amendments to HRS § 580-47(a)

Father argues that, despite the broad language of

HRS § 580-47(a), 1992 legislative amendments were intended to

limit the broad language by facilitating termination of child

support when an adult child is no longer in school, quoting the

legislative history of the 1992 amendments that “[c]urrent

statutes do not clearly specify that child support payments

terminate when the child becomes eighteen years old unless the

child is enrolled in an acceptable form of secondary education.” 
 Conf. Comm. Rpt. No. 19, 1992 Senate Journal at 739. The 1992

12

   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
amendments basically required that educational support may be

suspended for an adult child unless the child provides proof of

enrollment as a full-time student in school or has been accepted

and plans to attend as a full-time student for the next semester. 
 Father then argues that the 1992 amendments, combined with the

subsequent Nabarrete decision, show a legislative intent to limit

the broad language of HRS § 580-47(a) with respect to educational

support for an adult child. 
 
We do not find Father’s argument persuasive. We 
previously discussed the infirmities of Nabarrete herein. With respect to the statutory amendments, where the statutory language is plain and unambiguous, we give effect to the statute’s plain and obvious meaning. State v. Silver, 125 Hawai' i at 4, 249 P.3d 
at 1144. In our view, the 1992 statutory amendments to HRS § 580-47(a) do not in any respect limit the family court’s broad authority to provide educational support for an adult child. E.		The Legislature’s Failure to Act in Response to the ICA Case
Law Shows That the Legislature Tacitly Approved the ICA
Decisions, Giving Them the Effect of Legislation.

Father cites two cases in support of his argument that

the legislature’s failure to act in response to the ICA decisions

in Nabarrete and Mack shows that the legislature tacitly approved

the ICA decisions, giving them the effect of legislation. Both

of these cases are easily distinguishable.

In State v. Dannenberg, 74 Haw. 75, 837 P.2d 776

(1992), we addressed the statutory language of HRS § 712-1200(4),

a prostitution statute which contains its own mandatory

sentencing scheme. This mandatory sentencing scheme provided
 
that “notwithstanding any other law to the contrary,” for any

subsequent offense, “a fine of $500 and term of imprisonment of

thirty days, without possibility of suspension of sentence or

probation.” Id. at 80, 837 P.2d at 778 (emphasis in original). 
 
In State v. Rice, 66 Haw. 101, 657 P.2d 1026 (1983), we

interpreted “[n]otwithstanding any other law to the contrary” in

HRS § 712-1200 as language taking away the trial court’s power to

grant deferred acceptance of guilty (DAG) pleas. Id. at 102, 657

P.2d at 1026. In Dannenberg, we found that while defendant’s

argument that the mandatory sentencing provisions of HRS § 712­
1200 only apply where the defendant is actually “convicted” and

that a DAG plea is not a conviction is well taken, to permit a

trial court to defer the entry of a plea in order to avoid a

conviction permits the court to avoid the sentencing scheme

created by the legislature specifically for prostitution cases

would be repugnant to legislative intent. Dannenberg, 74 Haw.

at 80, 837 P.2d at 778-79. It was in this context that the

Dannenberg court stated that the legislature’s failure to react

in response to its holding in Rice concerning statutory

14

   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
interpretation of HRS § 712-1200(4) must be considered to have

the tacit approval of the legislature. 
 
In the second case cited by Father, State v. Hussein, 
122 Hawai' i 495, 229 P.3d 313 (2010), we discussed multiple 
issues in the sentencing of criminal defendants, and ultimately imposed a new requirement that sentencing courts must state the reasons for imposing consecutive sentences. The dissent in Hussein objected to the imposition of the new requirement on several grounds, one of which was that the sentencing judge would be placed at risk of violating HRS § 806-73 (Supp. 2008), which states that “[a]ll adult probation records shall be confidential and shall not be deemed to be public records.” Id. at 540, 229 
P.3d at 358 (Moon, C.J., concurring in part, and dissenting in part, joined by Nakayama, J.). In responding to this specific point, the majority opinion noted that the dissent’s concerns have already been considered by the legislature when it amended the statute in 2006 to “add persons and entities to the list of those who are allowed access to adult probation records.” Id. at 
529, 229 P.3d at 347. The majority opinion further noted that the legislature’s decision to increase the availability of PSI reports came long after this court had addressed the importance of stating sentencing reasons on the record in Lau, Sinagoga, Leesary, and related cases, and that the legislature had not responded to this court’s admonition to sentencing courts to give 
15

   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
reasons for their sentence by altering the language in either HRS

§ 806-73 or HRS § 706-604. Id. It was in this context that we

stated that the legislature’s failure to act in response to our

statutory interpretation must be considered to have the tacit

approval of the legislature. Id. (citing Gray v. Admin. Dir.,

84 Haw. 138, 143 n.9, 931 P.2d 580, 585 n.9 (1997)(quoting

Dannenberg, 74 Haw. at 83, 837 P.2d at 780)). 
 
The context of these two cases is far different from

the ICA cases relied upon by Father. In fact, in neither the
 
Nabarrete or Mack cases was the statutory language of HRS § 580­
47(a) at issue in this case even discussed, much less constitute

a statutory interpretation holding in either case. As discussed

earlier herein, the Nabarrete citation is to a footnote in an ICA

opinion which does not discuss HRS § 580-47(a) in either the text

of the opinion or in the footnote. While Mack mentions HRS

§ 580-47(a), there is no discussion of the statutory language or

the source of the age limitation of 23 for educational support. 
 
In this context, we do not find Father’s argument that

“legislative inaction equals tacit approval” of the ICA decisions 
 persuasive. 
 F.		The Family Court Did Not Abuse its Discretion in Ordering
Educational Support to Daughter.

Having established that HRS § 580-47(a) does not impose

an age limit for educational support of an adult child, we now

address the issue of whether the family court abused its

16

   
         
        
       
         
       
         
        *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
discretion in this case when it ordered educational support for

Daughter. 
 
We hold that the family court did not abuse its

discretion when it ordered educational support for Daughter. The

family court’s findings of fact include findings that Daughter

has been blind since birth, completed high school at age 20, and

is pursuing her college education, with the goal of being a flute

teacher. The number of academic credits Daughter has taken and

is taking is determined in collaboration with her school academic

counselor. Daughter anticipates attending college for

approximately two to four more years. The family court concluded
 
that 
 
FOF No. 14. Based on [Daughter’s] testimony that her
curriculum is made in collaboration with her school academic
 
counselor, and the mobility and other classes that
[Daughter] takes, the Court finds that she is taking a
reasonable and appropriate amount of credits to complete
college in a timely fashion and is considered a full-time
student in view of her sight disability.
 
As conceded by Father: “There is no suggestion herein
 
that [Daughter] did not make a good faith effort to continue and

complete her education to the best of her ability. It was not

unreasonable under the circumstances that it was taking her

longer to complete her education than would have been the case if

she did not have a physical disability.” 
 
Based on these findings of fact, the family court did

not abuse its discretion when it ordered educational support for

Daughter.

G. The ICA Erred in its Analysis and Remand Order.

Based upon our analysis discussed herein, we

respectfully disagree with the ICA’s analysis and remand order. 
 
IV. CONCLUSION

Our holding that HRS § 580-47(a) does not impose an age

limit for educational support of a child age 23 or older is not

intended to be a “sea change” in the family court’s consideration

of requests for educational support of an adult child. The facts

of this case present a unique and compelling basis for Daughter’s

continuing educational support beyond the age of 23, which the

family court granted in the exercise of its discretion. It is

anticipated that family courts will continue to consider all

relevant factors when presented with a request for educational

support of an adult child, including but not limited to, the

financial conditions of the parties, the anticipated length of

the college or other educational program being pursued by the

child as a full-time student, the ability of the child to

contribute to his/her educational support by working part-time,

obtaining scholarships, grants, student loans, and other

financial assistance, and any other relevant circumstance,

including but not limited to, a child’s disability. 
 
In light of our disagreement with that part of the

Intermediate Court of Appeals’ February 8, 2011 opinion

concerning Appellee Father’s obligation to provide educational

18

   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
support for Daughter, we vacate the Intermediate Court of

Appeals’ March 30, 2011 amended judgment on appeal, and affirm

the family court’s March 6, 2006 order reestablishing educational

support for Daughter.
