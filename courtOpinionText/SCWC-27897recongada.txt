ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION IN PART 
 (By: 
Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, and Duffy, JJ.,
with Acoba, J., dissenting, with whom McKenna, J., joins)

Upon consideration of Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant

Lloyd Pratt’s motion for reconsideration filed on May 21, 2012,

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that motion is granted in part. 
 
The published opinion filed on May 11, 2012 is amended as

follows:

Page 11, footnote 9, now reads: 
 
Pratt does not pursue the RFRA, ex post facto, or stare
decisis claims in his application for writ of certiorari,
thus, this opinion does not fully articulate these
arguments. Pratt’s argument as to the rule of lenity is
reviewed in Section III.B., infra.

On Page 18, footnote 11 is added. The additional

footnote reads:

Pratt also argues that the rule of lenity precludesconviction. The rule of lenity is a rule of statutory construction. State v. Shimabukuro , 100 Hawai 'i 324, 327, 60
P.3d, 274, 277 (2002) (“Where a criminal statute isambiguous, it is to be interpreted according to the rule of          
         
        
          
        
         
           
 lenity.”). Pratt does not argue that the regulation under
which he was convicted is ambiguous, but rather that the
constitutional privilege is ambiguous. Pratt does not cite,
and the court was unable to find, any authority for applying
the rule of lenity to constitutional affirmative defenses.
The court therefore agrees with the conclusion of the trial
court and ICA that the rule of lenity does not apply in
Pratt’s case.
 
An Amended Opinion will be filed contemporaneously with

this Order. 
The motion is denied in all other respects.
