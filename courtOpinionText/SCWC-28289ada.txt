RECKTENWALD, C.J., NAKAYAMA, ACOBA, DUFFY, AND MCKENNA, JJ.
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY RECKTENWALD, C.J.
 
Heinrich Alexander Riethbrock and Marion Barbara Lange
 
were married in 1997. Riethbrock filed a Complaint for Divorce
 
in 2004. The Family Court of the Second Circuit (family court)1
 
granted the parties’ stipulated divorce decree on August 8, 2005,
 reserving jurisdiction over division of the parties’ assets and

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
debts. 
Riethbrock subsequently failed to appear at various 
hearings, failed to respond to Lange’s discovery requests, and 
requested numerous continuances. On Lange’s motion, the family court issued a series of orders that indicated its intent to award Lange a one-half share of the parties’ real property located in Pukalani, Maui. On June 8, 2006, the family court granted Lange’s request to list the Pukalani property for sale, and subsequently filed various orders to effectuate the sale of the property. On October 5, 2006, Riethbrock filed a motion to stay the sale of the Pukalani property and to dismiss, in which he argued that the family court did not have jurisdiction to order the sale because it had failed to enter judgment or issue a ruling dividing the Pukalani property within one year of entering its stipulated divorce decree, as required under this court’s holding in Boulton v. Boulton, 69 Haw. 1, 730 P.2d 338 (1986), which interpreted Hawai
'i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 580-56(d).2 On 
October 26, 2006, the family court filed its Order Denying Pending Motions, in which it denied Riethbrock’s motion for stay 
2
 HRS § 580-56(d) (2006) provides:
 
Following the entry of a decree of divorce, or the
entry of a decree or order finally dividing the
property of the parties to a matrimonial action if the
same is reserved in the decree of divorce, or the
elapse of one year after entry of a decree or order
reserving the final division of property of the party,
a divorced spouse shall not be entitled to dower or
curtesy in the former spouse’s real estate, or any
part thereof, nor to any share of the former spouse’s
personal estate.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
and for dismissal. On January 23, 2007, the family court filed
 
an order authorizing escrow to release a portion of the proceeds
 from the sale of the Pukalani property to Lange.
 
On appeal to the Intermediate Court of Appeals,
 
Riethbrock argued that: (1) the family court erred in denying his
 motion to stay and to dismiss because it did not have
 jurisdiction to divide the Pukalani property after the passage of
 one year, and (2) the family court’s order releasing the funds
 from escrow violated his constitutional rights to due process and
 equal protection. The ICA held that the family court implicitly
 divided the Pukalani property in its orders prior to the one year
 limitation set forth in Boulton and HRS § 580-56(d), and
 accordingly had jurisdiction to order the sale of the property to
 enforce its prior property division. Riethbrock v. Lange, Nos.
 
28289 and 28694, 2011 WL 3455829, at *1-2 (Haw. Ct. App. Aug. 8,
 2011)(SDO). The ICA further determined that it lacked
 jurisdiction to consider Riethbrock’s contention regarding the
 order releasing funds from escrow because Riethbrock failed to
 appeal that order. Id. at *2.
 
In his application, Riethbrock presents the following
 
two questions:
 
[1.] Did the [ICA] gravely err holding that the
[family court] had jurisdiction to divide the Pukalani
property more than a year after filing the divorce
decree, all in violation of Boulton v. Boulton, 69
Haw. 1, 730 P.2d 338 (1986), and HRS § 580-56(d)?
 
[2.] Did the ICA gravely err in depriving
[Riethbrock] of due process by holding that the
[c]ourt lacked jurisdiction to decide that the ex
parte motion releasing the sale proceeds from escrow?
 
3
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
(Formatting altered).
 
We conclude that HRS § 580-56(d) was intended to apply
 
only in the narrow context of limiting a spouse’s right to dower
 
or curtesy in his or her deceased former spouse’s estate. 
Accordingly, we overrule Boulton and hold that HRS § 580-56(d)
 did not divest the family court of jurisdiction over the property
 division in the instant case. We further hold that the ICA did
 not have jurisdiction to address the family court’s order
 releasing funds from escrow because Riethbrock failed to appeal
 that order. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the ICA.
 
I. Background
 
A. Family Court Proceedings
 
On July 15, 1997, Riethbrock and Lange, both natives of
 
Germany, were married in Maui, where they had been living since
 1996. The couple had a daughter who was born in 1999.
 
On April 2, 2004, Riethbrock filed a Complaint for
 
Divorce on grounds that the marriage was “irretrievably broken.”
 Lange filed an Answer on April 13, 2004 stating that the marriage
 was “irretrievably broken” and that “[a]ll assets should be
 divided in a just and equitable way between the parties.” In his
 “Position Statement,” Riethbrock contended that he should be
 entitled to the Pukalani property as his “sole and separate
 property” because he had acquired the Pukalani property “after
 the parties’ separation in July 2001 and [Lange] has made no
 monetary contribution and has never resided this [sic] real
 
4
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
property.” Conversely, in her “Position Statement,” Lange argued 
that she and Riethbrock began to live separately when Riethbrock moved onto the Pukalani property, which was “purchased while the parties were married and living together[,]” and that the Pukalani property should “be divided in accordance with Hawai
'i 
Partnership principles with [Lange] having a one-half interest.” 
The family court initially set the case for trial on 
November 18 and 19, 2004, but the trial was continued. On April 1, 2005, Riethbrock filed an amended Position Statement in which he asserted that awarding him the Pukalani property would “take[] into consideration the assets of [Riethbrock] existing at the time of the marriage and assets acquired since that time.” At an April 8, 2005 hearing, Lange orally moved to continue trial based on the need for additional information to be provided to the court regarding the awarding of child custody and visitation. The family court continued trial to June 24, 2005, and it appears the trial was subsequently continued again to July 14 and 15, 2005. Riethbrock subsequently moved for another continuance on grounds that he was in Germany and could not return to Hawai
'i 
because he did not have a valid visa. Lange opposed the motion. The family court denied Riethbrock’s motion with respect to the divorce and custody and visitation rights, but granted it with respect to the property division. Accordingly, the family court continued trial on issues relating to the property division to December 15 and 16, 2005. 
5
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
A partial trial on the divorce and child custody issues
 
was held on July 14, 2005, and on August 8, 2005, the family
 
court filed its Stipulated Decree Granting Divorce and Awarding
 Child Custody, in which it awarded sole legal and physical
 custody of their daughter to Lange. The family court “reserved”
 “[a]ll other divorce issues, including but not limited to child
 support and the division of assets and debts[.]”
 
On December 13, 2005, Riethbrock sent the family court
 
a fax requesting a continuance because he was suffering from
 pneumonia and pleurisy. It appears that at a December 14, 2005
 
3
hearing,  Lange orally moved that Riethbrock submit to an
independent medical examination and Riethbrock’s counsel orally
 moved to continue trial. 
The family court granted both motions
 
and trial was continued to February 3, 2006. On December 15,
 2005, Riethbrock’s counsel filed a motion to withdraw and for an
 order to establish an attorney’s lien pursuant to HRS § 507-81.
 
On January 12, 2006, Lange filed an “Ex Parte Motion
 
for an Order Directing [Riethbrock] to do Everything Within His
 Power to Have the [Pukalani property] Reconveyed Back to
 [Riethbrock] -- by [Alfred Reichardt], in Whose Favor a Quitclaim
 Deed was Executed by [Riethbrock] and Recorded on December 23,
 2005.” 
In his declaration, Lange’s counsel stated that he went
 
on-line to verify the status of the Pukalani property and
 
3
 The transcript of the December 14, 2005 hearing is not in the
record.
 
6
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
discovered that Riethbrock had quitclaimed it to Reichardt,
 
Riethbrock’s friend in Germany. Lange asserted that the motion
 was being made “within a few hours of . . . learning of the
 highly improper and prejudicial transfer of title[.]” Lange
 attached a copy of the quitclaim deed to her motion. The family
 court subsequently granted the motion and ordered Riethbrock to
 do “everything in his power to accomplish the immediate
 reconveyance and recording” of the Pukalani property. 
Additionally, the court ordered Riethbrock to pay Lange’s
 attorney’s fees in connection with the reconveyance.
 
On January 13, 2006, the family court granted
 
Riethbrock’s counsel’s motion to withdraw, but denied without
 prejudice the request to establish an attorney’s lien.
 
In a pro se position statement filed on January 27,
 
2006, Riethbrock contended that he made the down payment on the
 Pukalani property with money from his own funds and money gifted
 to him by his mother.
 
On February 1, 2006, Lange filed a motion in limine
 
requesting that the family court preclude Riethbrock “from
 introducing any evidence at the February 3, 2006 trial” and that
 Riethbrock be “found to be in default” because Riethbrock had not
 cooperated in the discovery process and had “manipulate[d] and
 insult[ed] this court” by transferring the Pukalani property. 
Additionally, Lange requested the court find that:
 
Lange has a 50% beneficial interest in said real
property. Said interest is based on [Riethbrock] and
 
7
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
[Lange] being married and living together at the time
that [Riethbrock] purchased said property; based on
[Riethbrock] and [Lange] having shared their expenses
since 1994; based upon [Lange] having never
quitclaimed or otherwise given away her marital
interest in said property; and based upon
[Riethbrock’s] often expressed intention to have
[Lange] live with [Riethbrock] on said property (at
the time said property was purchased and for years
thereafter).
 
Riethbrock did not appear at the February 3, 2006
 
trial. At the start of trial, the family court addressed three
 
faxes it had received from Riethbrock, one of which the court
 interpreted to be a position statement on the property division
 issue, and the other two as motions for continuances. The court
 noted the many opportunities it had given to Riethbrock to be
 present at trial, including an opportunity to participate in the
 February 3, 2006 trial by way of video conferencing. However,
 the court received no inquiries or requests from Riethbrock to
 participate using video conferencing. In addition, with regard
 to Riethbrock’s motions for continuances, the family court
 stated, in relevant part:
 
This matter has been pending for quite some
time, and it is this [c]ourt’s position that it has
previously made every effort to allow [] Riethbrock to
attend this trial and that this [c]ourt does no longer
have the ability to wait and see if [] Riethbrock will
ever return to the United States[.]
 . . . .
 Riethbrock has had numerous continuances and at this
 point the [c]ourt is denying any requests for a
continuance of trial.
 
The family court then took up the property division
 
issue. The court noted that it was unaware of any motion to
 
bring in the third party to whom the Pukalani property was
 conveyed, and determined that the property was not in the marital
 
8
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
estate. Lange responded that the family court still had a
 
“legitimate right and interest to carry out the -- the parties’
 interests, particularly [Lange’s] interest in the property[.]” 
The family court stated:
 
I think there needs to be a finding first that
there was a fraudulent transfer. And I think the
 
person whose interest in that property will be
effected [sic] has a right to participate in that
proceeding, which is why I think that you need to have
that person made part and parcel of this proceeding.
I mean I -- I see it -- two problems I see. Is,
one, I -- I still think that this property no longer
is part of the marital estate. Now, maybe it was
fraudulently transferred out of the marital estate and
maybe there is a way of addressing that, but I think
that the way of addressing that does also include
notice to that person and participation in that
proceeding.
. . . And as I indicated before I can only divide what
is part of the marital estate. And if the property is
not in the marital estate then the first, I think,
order of business would be to get it back in the
marital estate if that can be accomplished.
 
The family court granted Lange’s February 1, 2006
 
motion in limine to the extent it requested that Riethbrock be
 
precluded from presenting evidence. The family court then
 defaulted Riethbrock only on the issue of child support, stating
 that it would like to deal with each of the remaining issues
 separately. Accordingly, the family court did not admit evidence
 on the value of the property or whether it was part of the
 marital estate, but rather heard testimony from Lange regarding
 the parties’ financial situation as it pertained to the issue of
 child support. Lange attempted to have an appraiser testify as
 to the value of the Pukalani property, but the family court
 denied the testimony because it believed the property was no
 longer part of the marital estate. The family court reserved
 
9
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
deciding the property division issue until Reichardt was brought
 
into the proceeding. The family court continued the property
 division portion of the trial until March 8, 2006 to give Lange
 “enough time to either file a memorandum or obtain service on
 [Reichardt].”
 
Lange filed a memorandum of law on February 16, 2006,
 
regarding whether Reichardt needed to be joined. Lange argued
 that, even in the absence of Reichardt, the family court had
 jurisdiction to determine: (1) whether the transfer of the
 Pukalani property to Reichardt was fraudulent; (2) the value of
 the Pukalani property; and (3) the value of each spouse’s
 interest in said property.
 
In its March 6, 2006 Order After Trial/Hearing
 
concerning the February 3, 2006 trial, the family court
 determined, in relevant part:
 
C. Next, the court dealt with the matter of the
real property (located at 241 Hiwalani Loop, Pukalani
Hawaii (TMK(2)2-3-054-034)) that [Riethbrock] had
quitclaimed to a third person ([Riethbrock’s] good
friend [Reichardt] in Germany) on or about December 5,
2005 (ten days before the December 15, 2005 trial date
for which [Riethbrock] had been granted a continuance
to February 3, 2006). Said quitclaim was recorded by
the Bureau of Conveyances on December 23, 2005.
Based on such transfer of the property, the
court makes a finding that said property is not now in
the marital estate.
 
1. The court finds that it only has
jurisdiction to decide what is in the marital estate.
The court finds that legal notice of these divorce
proceedings (concerning the disposition of said real
property) need be given to [] Reichardt before the
court could have jurisdiction to make orders
concerning: (1) the validity of the transfer of said
property by [Riethbrock]; (2) the [c]ourt’s
jurisdiction to order the Bureau of Conveyances to do
anything concerning said property[;] and (3) whether
the court has jurisdiction to rule that said transfer
by [Riethbrock] was a fraudulent transfer.
 
10
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
2. The court further determined that it is
 
premature for [Lange] to ask the court to find that
the transfer from [Riethbrock] to [] Reichardt was
fraudulent.
 
. . . .
 D. Concerning [Lange’s] Supplementary Motion in
Limine; Request #1:
 
Order #3: Said request is GRANTED:
[Riethbrock] is precluded from introducing any
evidence (as a sanction for [Riethbrock’s]
continuing unwillingness to provide responses to
legitimate discovery; as a sanction for making
false statements in order to obtain
 continuances; as a sanction for “giving away”
the major asset that was subject to division by
this court; and as a sanction for [Riethbrock’s]
continuing failure to follow the applicable
laws, court rules and procedures that guide
divorcing parties).
 
E. As to Request #2 (holding [Riethbrock] in
contempt) and #3 (finding [Riethbrock] in default as
to all remaining issues in the case:
 
Order #4: The court DENIED, in part, [Lange’s]
Request for Default. Said request was denied in
part pending [] Reichardt being brought into the
case and/or the court receiving legal authority
from [Lange] that the court has the authority to
grant the default without transferee []
Reichardt having an opportunity to participate
in the litigation.
 
Order #5: The court DENIED, without prejudice
[Lange’s] request to hold [Riethbrock] in
Contempt.
 
. . . .
 
G. Concerning Request Number 7 [asking the court to
find that Lange has a 50% beneficial interest in the
Pukalani property] on page 6 of the Memorandum in
Support of [Lange’s] Supplementary Motion in Limine:
 
Order #7: GRANTED, to the extent that the court
will allow [Lange] to put on evidence at the
trial today in support of [Lange’s] contention
that she has a 50% beneficial interest in said
 property. [Riethbrock] is defaulted on this
issue and he precluded [sic] from presenting any
contrary evidence or argument concerning the
extent of [Lange’s] interest in said property.
 
H. Concerning Request Number 8 [asking the court to
mandate that Riethbrock pay Lange’s attorney’s fees]
on page 7 of the Memorandum in Support of [Lange’s]
Supplementary Motion in Limine:
 
11
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Order #8: Said request is GRANTED, as to extent
of [Lange’s] attorney’s fees that [Riethbrock]
shall be responsible for paying. [Lange] will
be allowed to present further evidence at trial,
and by way of affidavit and by way or [sic]
argument. [Riethbrock] is defaulted on the
issue of [Lange’s] attorney’s fees and he is
precluded from presenting any evidence or
argument on this issue.
 
A hearing was held on March 8, 2006, but no transcripts
 
of that hearing are contained in the record on appeal. On
 
March 29, 2006, the family court entered an Order After Hearing
 in which the court “reconsidered its position concerning the
 [Pukalani] property” after reviewing Lange’s February 16, 2006
 memorandum. The family court found that the Pukalani property
 was part of the marital estate. The family court further
 concluded that it had jurisdiction to decide each spouse’s
 interest in the real property without requiring that Reichardt be
 made a party. The family court also ordered Riethbrock to
 “accomplish” the reconveyance of the Pukalani property by
 March 29, 2006, and set a hearing for May 8, 2006 for all further
 motions. The family court reserved for decision its
 determination of the value of the Pukalani property and the value
 of Lange’s interest in the property until May 8, 2006. In regard
 to child support, the family court found that Riethbrock “cannot
 be relied on to make child support payments to [Lange]” and
 accordingly found that “child support payments for a significant
 period of time should be paid from [Riethbrock’s] one-half
 interest of said real property.” (Emphasis added). In addition,
 
12
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the family court determined that Lange was entitled to attorney’s
 
fees from Riethbrock’s interest in the Pukalani property.
 
On April 21, 2006, Lange filed a renewed motion for
 
default on “all the remaining issues[.]” Also on April 21, 2006,
 Lange filed a Supplemental Memorandum of Law in which she argued
 that Riethbrock had no right to introduce evidence regarding the
 property division. Lange argued that she should receive a “fifty
 percent interest” in the Pukalani property. Lange noted that she
 had testified that she and Riethbrock shared expenses and acted
 as an “economic unit” throughout their marriage. Lange
 acknowledged that Riethbrock “negotiated for, qualified for and
 otherwise arranged to purchase real property in his name alone”
 while she and Riethbrock were married and living together. Lange
 asserted that Riethbrock kept asking her to move to the Pukalani
 property. Lange further asserted that she and Riethbrock
 continued to share expenses and act as an “economic unit.” Lange
 also argued that her son from a previous marriage lived with
 Riethbrock on the Pukalani property and helped to care for the
 couple’s minor daughter.
 
On May 5, 2006, Riethbrock’s new counsel filed a
 
response to Lange’s motion for default. Riethbrock asserted that
 the Pukalani property had been timely transferred back to
 Riethbrock. Riethbrock presented arguments regarding the
 valuation of the Pukalani property, but did not present any
 argument regarding how the property should be divided.
 
13
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
At the May 8, 2006 hearing, Riethbrock appeared by
 
phone. Riethbrock’s new counsel recognized that pursuant to the
 
family court’s prior rulings, “[t]here was a 50 percent
 beneficial interest that [Lange] was held to have in his real
 property here in Maui.” The family court acknowledged that the
 Pukalani property had been returned to the marital estate, and
 stated that it would issue a restraining order that Riethbrock
 “not convey in any fashion the ownership or any control of the
 property to anyone unless it is pursuant to a court ordered
 sale.” The family court also ordered that “the property be
 listed and placed for sale effective immediately[,]” and asked
 the parties to make their best efforts to agree to a listing
 agent to sell the property. The family court indicated that,
 upon the sale, but “[b]efore distribution of the sale proceeds
 from escrow[,] the [c]ourt will make an order detailing such
 distribution.” However, Lange’s counsel argued that a hearing on
 the distribution of the sale proceeds would only be appropriate
 if the parties could not agree. The family court responded, “in
 case that distribution of the sales proceeds from escrow is
 contested for whatever reason[,] the parties can bring this
 matter before the [c]ourt.” The family court advised the parties
 to submit “a stipulated order detailing the distribution” or, if
 a stipulation could not be reached, a “proposed order,” which the
 court would then “pick whichever one.”
 
On June 8, 2006, the family court issued its Order
 
14
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
After Hearing, in which it recounted its oral rulings, in
 
relevant part, as follows:
 
6. Concerning [Lange’s] [r]equest that the real
property be listed for sale immediately: GRANTED. The
 
[c]ourt determined that there is no alternative other
than immediately listing said property for sale and
selling it.
 
. . . .
 9. Concerning the matter of final distribution of
the proceeds of escrow:
a) If the parties agree, they shall submit a
proposed Stipulated Order for the [c]ourt’s signature.
b) If there is a dispute between [Riethbrock]
and [Lange] regarding such distribution, each party
shall submit a pleading that includes their [sic]
proposed distribution. 
Oral argument is waived by the
parties; the matter will be submitted for the
[c]ourt’s written decision.
c) There shall be no final distribution until
the [c]ourt signs such a distribution order.
 
. . . . 
12. Concerning [Lange’s] [r]equest that future child
support for a period of at least ten years be taken
from [Riethbrock’s] share of the proceeds of the real
property sale and placed in an interest bearing trust
account from which monthly child support payments
would be made to [Lange]:
GRANTED. At [Riethbrock’s] suggestion, all
future child support (approximately seventeen years)
plus [Riethbrock’s] one-half share of college expenses
shall be taken from [Riethbrock’s] one-half share of
the property sale proceeds. 
The trust department of a
major Hawaii Statewide bank shall administer said
trust fund provided [sic] [Lange] with eight hundred
seventy dollars ($870.00) a month payments and shall
also provide to both parties annual reports on the
condition of the fund and its disbursements. Any
funds remaining after the final disbursement of
payments, shall be considered the separate property of
[Riethbrock] and subject to further distribution by
the [c]ourt.
 
13. Concerning [Lange’s] [r]equest that attorney’s
fees be granted to [Lange] in the amounts that have
already been requested and may be requested throughout
the pendency of this case:
GRANTED in part and deferred in part. GRANTED
 
as to the latest request for $3,154.31 and deferred as
to the other prior request (for $65,928.51) and as to
future requests for attorney’s fees.
 
(Formatting altered).
 
15
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
On June 15, 2006, Lange filed a motion to order the
 
clerk of the second circuit court to sign the real property
 
Listing Agreement because Riethbrock had refused to execute it. 
On August 14, 2006, Lange, citing HRS § 580-56(d) and Boulton,
 filed a motion for the court to promptly enter an order deciding
 all remaining or reserved property division issues because
 further delay “may cause this court to ultimately lose
 
jurisdiction to divide the marital property.” Lange then filed a
 
series of motions to effectuate the sale of the Pukalani
 
property.
 
On September 11, 2006, Lange’s counsel filed a motion
 
for a judgment and an order establishing an attorney’s lien
 pursuant to HRS § 507-81 on the sale proceeds of the Pukalani
 property.
 
On September 12, 2006, the family court authorized the
 
clerk to sign the “Deposit Receipt Offer and Acceptance on
 [Riethbrock’s] behalf to accept the pending offer to purchase”
 the Pukalani property for $515,000.00. Additionally, on
 September 26, 2006, the family court ordered the clerk to sign
 “any and all documents on behalf of [] Riethbrock in connection
 with the sale and escrow of the parties’ [Pukalani property.]” 
In a separate order dated September 26, 2006, the family court
 ordered the escrow company to “[d]istribute the payments to
 itself, the real estate brokers and all those who were
 responsible for the closing of escrow” as well as “[p]ay
 
16
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
[Lange’s] child support arrearage in the amount of $13,920.00
 
from [] Riethbrock’s one-half share of the net proceeds of
 escrow[.]” In addition, escrow was “restrained and enjoined from
 making any other distribution of funds from said escrow until
 further order of [the] [c]ourt.”
 
On October 5, 2006, Riethbrock filed a Motion and
 
Memorandum for Stay of Orders to Sell Property of [Riethbrock];
 and for Dismissal of Action (motion for stay). Riethbrock argued
 that the family court did not have jurisdiction to order the sale
 of the Pukalani property because it had failed to enter judgment
 or issue a ruling dividing the property within one year of
 entering its stipulated divorce decree. Riethbrock cited Boulton
 to support his assertion that the family court’s failure to
 divide the property within one year divested it of jurisdiction
 to distribute the sale proceeds. In her opposition to
 Riethbrock’s motion, Lange argued that Riethbrock’s reliance on
 Boulton was misplaced, that the family court did divide the
 property before the lapse of the one year limitation, and that
 the litigation was prolonged because Riethbrock had engaged in an
 effort to “delay,” “misrepresent,” “stonewall,” “abuse the
 litigation process,” “and act in bad faith.”
 
On October 19, 2006, the family court held a hearing on
 
Riethbrock’s motion for stay, and Lange’s motion for the court to
 promptly decide all remaining or reserved property division
 issues. Lange argued, inter alia, that the family court had
 
17
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
already divided the property by ordering that Riethbrock’s 50%
 
interest in the sale proceeds be placed in a trust for future
 child support payments, and that Boulton was distinguishable from
 the present case. Riethbrock argued, inter alia, that
 Boulton was applicable to the present case, that the court did
 not establish a valuation for the property, and that the court’s
 “oblique reference” to a one-half interest did not constitute a
 judgment as to the property division issue. The family court
 orally ruled as follows:
 
that it had previously entered on June 8th an order
determining the amount of the child support that shall
be taken from [Riethbrock’s] one-half share of the
sales proceeds. Clearly that -- and -- and this was,
and I previously stated at [Riethbrock’s] suggestion
and agreement that the child support -- the future
child support of approximately 17 years plus college
costs shall be held in trust.
 
And so, at this point the [c]ourt is not going
to stop the sale [of the Pukalani property]. The
 [c]ourt is going to give enforcement to the [c]ourt’s
previous order with respect to the child support.
It appears to the [c]ourt that the [c]ourt may
have implicitly made property division in this case.
Certainly this sentence that I keep referring to from
the June 8th -- June 8th order, paragraph 12. Again,
it indicates that the child support is to be taken
from [Riethbrock’s] one-half share of the property
sale proceeds.
And while I agree with [Riethbrock’s counsel]
that the one-half share of the sale’s proceeds is not
a determined number, in other words we don’t know if
the house is going to sell for $513,000, or $500,000,
or $450,000, whatever that one-half share is the
[c]ourt has previously determined that [Riethbrock] is
entitled to one-half share and consequently [Lange]
appears to be entitled to one-half share.
However, there is no final order which clearly
sets forth determined amounts and detailed division,
but I think implicitly the [c]ourt has made a property
division of 50-50 in this case.
 
On October 26, 2006, the family court entered its Order
 
Denying Pending Motions, in which it denied Riethbrock’s motion
 
for stay and for dismissal. The court stated:
 
18
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Although not explicitly stated in the [c]ourt’s
June 8, 2006 Order, it is implicit that the [c]ourt
was dividing the real estate on the basis that each
party would receive a one-half share of the net sale
proceeds of the property, because the [c]ourt ordered
that [] Riethbrock’s one-half share of the proceeds
would initially be placed in a trust fund for past and
future child support payments. Therefore, the [c]ourt
has finally divided the property within the one-year
period as required by HRS § 580-56(d).
Secondly, the [c]ourt denies the motion to make
any additional orders with respect to property
division, because such orders would now be outside the
prescribed period for such orders.
[Riethbrock’s] motion for dismissal of [Lange’s]
property claims on the basis that no property division
order was made is also denied. As noted above, the
[c]ourt implicitly made an order finally dividing the
property in its Order dated June 8, 2006. Because
 that motion of [Riethbrock] is denied, it follows that
[Riethbrock] is not entitled to a stay of the sale,
and that motion is also denied.
 
On November 24, 2006, Riethbrock timely filed his first
 
Notice of Appeal (Case No. 28289) of the family court’s
 
October 26, 2006 Order Denying Pending Motions.
 
On January 23, 2007, Lange filed an Ex Parte Motion
 
Releasing [Lange’s] Funds from Escrow. 
Also on January 23, 2007,
 
the family court granted Lange’s ex parte motion and ordered that
 escrow was authorized to release funds totaling $100,000.00 from
 Lange’s share of the sale proceeds and $1,740.00 from
 Riethbrock’s share of the sale proceeds to cover his child
 support payments for December 2006 and January 2007. No Notice
 of Appeal was filed from this order.
 
On July 24, 2007, the family court filed an Order
 
Pertaining to Request for Attorney’s Fees, which mandated, inter
 alia, that Riethbrock pay Lange’s attorney’s fees and costs in
 the amount of $65,928.51. The family court referenced its
 
19
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
previous determinations regarding the awarding of attorney’s fees
 
to Lange. On August 20, 2007, Riethbrock filed his second Notice
 of Appeal (Case No. 28694), in which he challenged the family
 court’s July 24, 2007 Order.
 
B. ICA Appeal
 
Riethbrock filed two separate Opening Briefs in Case 
Nos. 28289 and 28694. Riethbrock, 2011 WL 3455829, at *1. The 
ICA consolidated the two appeals for disposition. However, the 
ICA’s ruling on Riethbrock’s appeal in Case No. 28694, which concerned the family court’s order regarding attorney’s fees, is not challenged in Riethbrock’s questions presented. Accordingly, the arguments raised in Riethbrock’s Opening Brief in Case No. 28694 are not discussed further. Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 40.1(d)(1) (“The application for a writ of certiorari . . . shall contain . . . [a] short and concise statement of the questions presented for decision. . . . Questions not presented according to this paragraph will be disregarded.”) (emphasis added). 
In his Opening Brief to the ICA in Case No. 28289,
 
Riethbrock asserted two points of error:
 
A. The family court committed reversible error in
denying Riethbrock’s motion for stay of orders to sell
property of [Riethbrock] and for dismissal of the
action.
 . . . .
 B. The family court committed reversible and
constitutional error in filing the ex parte order on
January 23, 2007, authorizing escrow to release
$100,000 of the net sale proceeds from the Riethbrock
house to [Lange] and her ex-attorney in violation of
Riethbrock’s constitutional rights to due process and
 
20
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
equal protection.
 
Riethbrock argued that his motion to stay the orders to
 
sell the Pukalani property was impermissibly denied because the
 
family court lost jurisdiction when it failed to “divide and
 distribute” the Pukalani property within one year of its filing
 the divorce decree as required under Boulton and HRS § 580-56(d). 
Riethbrock contended that the family court did not divide the
 Pukalani property in its June 8, 2006 order because the court
 explicitly stated that the parties shall submit a proposed
 stipulated order, and that “[t]here shall be no final
 distribution until the [c]ourt signs such a distribution order.”
 Additionally, Riethbrock argued that “[t]he record does not
 reveal the existence of any such order filed within one year of
 August 8, 2005 in which the [c]ourt finally divided and
 distributed [Riethbrock’s] property and the Pukalani house.” 
Accordingly, Riethbrock argued that the family court “lacked
 jurisdiction of the subject matter to divide and distribute
 Riethbrock’s real estate[.]”
 
Riethbrock also contended that the family court’s 
January 23, 2007 ex parte order authorizing escrow to release $100,000 of the sale proceeds of the Pukalani property to Lange violated his right to procedural and substantive due process, his right to equal protection, and Hawai
'i Family Court Rules (HFCR) 
Rules 5 and 7. 
In her Answering Brief, Lange argued that although the
 
21
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
family court did not explicitly state that it was dividing the 
property in its June 8, 2006 order, the family court was not divested of jurisdiction because it had “defaulted [Riethbrock] as to [Lange’s] claim of a 50% interest in the property,” “used that division in making related orders (such as the fund for child support)[,]” and “fixed the value of the property at the sum of $513,000.” Alternatively, Lange asserted that the majority opinion in Boulton improperly characterized the legislative history of HRS § 580-56(d) as applying to all marital property, instead of merely “dower and curtesy rights” as asserted by the dissenting opinion. (Citing Boulton, 69 Haw. at 7, 730 P.2d at 341 (Wakatsuki, J., dissenting)). Lange also argued that post-Boulton decisions have shown that “a timely order for property division can be enforced after the one year period has ended[,]” and that Riethbrock’s misconduct, i.e., conveying the Pukalani property, should toll the statute. (Citing Todd v. Todd, 9 Haw. App. 214, 832 P.2d 280 (1992); Richter v. Richter, 108 Hawai
'i 504, 122 P.3d 284 (App. 2005); 
Kano v. Kano, 8 Haw. App. 172, 799 P.2d 55 (1990)). In addition, Lange argued that the January 23, 2007 order releasing funds from escrow did not violate Riethbrock’s constitutional rights. Lange further argued that Riethbrock’s appeal was, in effect, an untimely appeal of the June 8, 2006 order dividing the property. 
In his Reply Brief, Riethbrock argued, inter alia,
 
that: (1) Boulton is applicable and still valid law; (2) Lange’s
 
22
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
cited cases were distinguishable from the present situation in
 
which the family court lacked jurisdiction to divide the Pukalani
 property and order the distribution of the sale proceeds; and (3)
 the ICA had appellate jurisdiction.
 
The ICA concluded that because the family court had
 
“implicitly” divided the property in its June 8, 2006 order,
 “Lange’s interest in the Pukalani Property and the methodology by
 which she would receive that interest had been timely
 determined,” before the one-year limitation set forth in Boulton
 and HRS § 580-56(d). Riethbrock, 2011 WL 3455829, at *1-2.
 
Accordingly, the ICA determined that the family court properly
 denied Riethbrock’s motion to stay. Id. at *2. In addition, the
 
ICA determined that it lacked jurisdiction to address the family
 court’s January 23, 2007 order because it “arose two months after
 the [first] notice of appeal was filed[,]” and Riethbrock failed
 to file a separate notice of appeal from that order. Id.
 
The ICA affirmed the family court’s October 26, 2006
 
Order Denying Pending Motions, and entered its Judgment on Appeal
 on August 23, 2011. Id. at *3. Riethbrock timely filed his
 
application on November 16, 2011. Lange did not file a response.
 
II. Standards of Review
 
A. Statutory Interpretation
 
“Statutory interpretation is a question of law 
reviewable de novo.” State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai
'i 383, 390, 219 
P.3d 1170, 1177 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). This 
23
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
court’s construction of statutes is guided by the following
 
rules:
 
First, the fundamental starting point for statutory
interpretation is the language of the statute itself.
Second, where the statutory language is plain and
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its
plain and obvious meaning. Third, implicit in the
task of statutory construction is our foremost
obligation to ascertain and give effect to the
intention of the legislature, which is to be obtained
primarily from the language contained in the statute
itself. Fourth, when there is doubt, doubleness of
meaning, or indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an
expression used in a statute, an ambiguity exists.
 
Id. (quoting Citizens Against Reckless Dev. v. Zoning Bd. of
 
Appeals of the City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 114 Hawai 'i 184, 193, 
159 P.3d 143, 152 (2007)).
 
B.	 Subject Matter Jurisdiction
 
The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law
that we review de novo under the right/wrong standard.
Questions regarding subject matter jurisdiction may be
raised at any stage of a cause of action. When
 reviewing a case where the circuit court lacked
subject matter jurisdiction, the appellate court
retains jurisdiction, not on the merits, but for the
purpose of correcting the error in jurisdiction. A
 judgment rendered by a circuit court without subject
matter jurisdiction is void. 
Lingle v. Hawai 'i Gov’t Employees Ass’n, AFSCME, Local 152, 107 
Hawai'i 178, 182, 111 P.3d 587, 591 (2005) (quoting Amantiad v. 
Odum, 90 Hawai 'i 152, 158-59, 977 P.2d 160, 166-67 (1999)). 
III. Discussion
 
A.	 HRS § 580-56(d) does not limit the family court’s
jurisdiction to divide the marital property at issue in the
instant case
 
Riethbrock argues that pursuant to Boulton, the one
 
year limitation set forth in HRS § 580-56(d) divested the family
 
court of jurisdiction to divide the Pukalani property. HRS
 
24
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
§ 580-56(d) provides:
 
Following the entry of a decree of divorce, or the
entry of a decree or order finally dividing the
property of the parties to a matrimonial action if the
same is reserved in the decree of divorce, or the
elapse of one year after entry of a decree or order
reserving the final division of property of the party,
a divorced spouse shall not be entitled to dower or
curtesy in the former spouse’s real estate, or any
part thereof, nor to any share of the former spouse’s
personal estate.
 
(Emphasis added).
 
In Boulton, this court interpreted HRS § 580-56(d) to
 
divest the family court of jurisdiction to divide property in the
 
personal estate of a “former spouse” one year after the filing of
 a divorce decree. 69 Haw. at 4-5, 730 P.3d at 340. In his
 dissent, Justice Wakatsuki argued that the one year limitation
 set forth in HRS § 580-56(d) should be applied only to a spouse’s
 dower or curtesy interest in a former spouse’s property. Id. at 
6-7, 730 P.3d at 341. 
We conclude that Boulton should be overruled. We begin 
our analysis with a brief discussion of dower and curtesy, and
 the historical context in which HRS § 580-56(d) arose.
 
1. Dower and Curtesy
 
Dower is “a provision made by the law for the support
 
of a wife after the death of the husband.” Richards v. Richards,
 
44 Haw. 491, 504, 355 P.2d 188, 196 (1960) (emphasis added)
 
(citing Farm v. Cornn, 31 Haw. 574, at *6 (Haw. Terr. Oct. 9,
 1930)); In re Estate of Lorenzo, 61 Haw. 236, 241, 602 P.2d 521,
 526 (1979) (“Despite dower’s current statutory form, its purpose
 
25
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
and effect remain the same as that established at common law as a
 
marital right created to provide an assured means of support for
 the surviving wife.”). At the time HRS § 580-56(d) was enacted
 in 1973, HRS § 533-1 (Supp. 1973) provided:
 
Every woman shall be endowed of one-third part of all
the lands owned by her husband at any time during
marriage, in fee simple, in freehold, or in leasehold,
unless she is lawfully barred thereof. She shall also
 be entitled, by way of dower, to an absolute property
in the one-third part of all his remaining property
owned by him at the date of his death, after the
payment of all his just debts.
 
(Emphasis added).
 
Although common law dower was limited to a widow’s
 
interest in her former spouse’s real property, statutory dower
 
included a widow’s interest in both her deceased spouse’s real
 property and his personal property. See In re Castle’s Estate,
 
25 Haw. 108, at *4 (Haw. Terr. 1919); see also Carter v. Carter,
 10 Haw. 687 (Haw. Rep. 1897).
 
Similar to a woman’s dower interest, curtesy is a
 
widower’s right to certain property of a deceased wife. See
 
DeMello v. Home Escrow, Inc., 4 Haw. App. 41, 50, 659 P.2d 759,
 765 (1983) (noting that “during the life of the wife the husband
 has no curtesy right, inchoate or otherwise”); Iona v. Uu, 1905
 WL 1336, at *1-3 (Haw. Terr. Jan. 28, 1905) (noting that a
 husband received a curtesy interest upon the death of his wife). 
At the time HRS § 580-56(d) was enacted, HRS § 533-16 provided:
 
In case the wife dies first and intestate, then except
as in this section provided, her property shall
immediately descend to her heirs, but shall be in all
cases, whether she die testate or intestate, subject
to a life interest in the husband in one-third of the
 
26
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
wife’s lands owned by her in fee simple, in freehold,
or in leasehold, at the date of her death. The
 husband shall also, whether the wife die testate or
intestate, be entitled, by way of curtesy to an
absolute property in the one-third part of it all the
wife’s remaining property owned by her at the date of
her death, after the payment of all her just debts.
 
HRS § 533-16 (Supp. 1973) (emphasis added).
 
Accordingly, both dower and curtesy described a
 
spouse’s interest in his or her deceased spouse’s “real property”
 
and “remaining property.”4
 
2. Evolution of HRS § 580-56(d)
 
Revised Laws of Hawai 'i (RLH) § 324-45 (1955), the 
predecessor statute to HRS § 580-56(d), was entitled “Forfeiture
 
of dower” and provided: “A wife divorced shall not be entitled to
 dower in her husband’s real estate, or any part thereof, nor to
 any share of his personal estate.” Accordingly, under RLH § 324­45, a wife’s dower interest terminated immediately upon her
 divorce.
5
 
In 1973, the legislature recodified RLH § 324-45 as HRS
 
§ 580-56.6 In apparent recognition of the increasingly common 
4 In 1977, dower and curtesy were largely eliminated. See DeMello,
 
4 Haw. App. at 50 n.5, 659 P.2d at 765 n.5 (noting that 1976 Haw. Sess. Laws
Act 200, § 1 at 372, “eliminated dower and curtesy effective July 1, 1977, but
preserved all rights which accrued under case and statutory law relating to
dower and curtesy which vested prior to such date”). Dower was entirely
abolished in 1997. See 1997 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 244, § 17 at 495.
 
5
 There appears to have been no analogous predecessor statute that
would have provided that a husband forfeit his curtesy interest upon divorce.
 
6
 HRS § 580-56 (Supp. 1973) provided, in relevant part:
 
(a) Every decree of divorce which does not
specifically recite that the final division of the
property of the parties is reserved for further
hearing, decision, and orders shall finally divide the
(continued...)
 
27
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
practice of a bifurcated divorce, the legislature made several
 
6(...continued)
property of the parties to such action.
 
(b) Following the entry of a decree of divorce in
any matrimonial action in which the final division of
the property of the parties to such action is reserved
for further hearing, decision, and orders, each party
to such action shall continue to have all of the
 rights to and interests in the property of the other
party to such action as provided by chapter 533 to the
same extent he or she would have had such rights or
interests if the decree of divorce had not been
 entered, until the entry of a decree or order finally
dividing the property of the parties to such
matrimonial action, or as provided in subsection (d).
 
(c) When a party to a matrimonial action has
remarried following the entry of a decree of divorce,
in which the final division of the property of the
parties is reserved for further hearings, decisions
and orders, but prior to the entry of a decree or
order finally dividing the property owned by the
parties to that action, notwithstanding the provisions
of chapter 533, the spouse of such remarried party
shall have none of the rights or interests in the
former spouse’s real property or personal estate as
provided in chapter 533, or as otherwise provided by
law, until such time as a decree or order finally
dividing the property owned by the parties or either
of them as of the effective date of the entry of the
decree of divorce dissolving his or her prior marriage
shall be entered. 
Upon the entry of a decree or order
finally dividing the property of the parties to a
matrimonial action in which a decree of divorce has
 been entered, the spouse of a party to such action who
has remarried shall have all of the rights of a spouse
as provided by chapter 533, or as otherwise provided
by law, in and to the property of the former spouse
vested in such spouse by such decree or order finally
dividing the property of the parties or either of
them, as of the effective date of the entry of the
decree of dissolution of the prior marriage.
 
(d) Following the entry of a decree of divorce, or
the entry of a decree or order finally dividing the
property of the parties to a matrimonial action if the
same is reserved in the decree of divorce, or the
elapse of one year after entry of a decree or order
reserving the final division of property of the party,
a divorced spouse shall not be entitled to dower or
curtesy in the former spouse’s real estate, or any
part thereof, nor to any share of the former spouse’s
personal estate.
 
HRS § 580-56 has not materially changed since 1973. See HRS
 
§ 580-56 (2006). 
28
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
amendments. First, part (b) provided that after a divorce, all
 
HRS chapter 533 rights, i.e., those rights relating to dower and
 curtesy, were preserved until a final order on the division of
 the property was issued. HRS § 580-56(b). Second, part (c)
 provided that, in a situation where one spouse remarries and then
 dies before the property in the first marriage was finally
 divided, the new spouse would not have any HRS chapter 533 rights
 until after the property division order from the former marriage
 was entered. HRS § 580-56(c). However, after the entry of the
 property division order, the new spouse would have HRS chapter
 533 rights in the property that was awarded to their spouse in
 the former divorce. HRS § 580-56(c). Third, part (d) provided
 that one year after entry of a divorce decree reserving the final
 division of the couple’s property, a divorced spouse “shall not
 be entitled to dower or curtesy in the former spouse’s real
 estate, or any part thereof, nor to any share of the former
 spouse’s personal estate.” HRS § 580-56(d). Notably, although
 the predecessor statute applied only to dower, i.e., a woman’s
 interest in her husband’s property, the 1973 statute covered the
 rights of both spouses.
 
In a 1973 Committee Report regarding the amendments,
 
the Senate Judiciary Committee noted:
 
The purpose of this bill is to establish rights
of divorced persons to dower and curtesy in their
former spouse’s estates when the divorce decree does
not finally divide the property of the parties.
 . . . .
 
The divisible divorce, that is where the
marriage is dissolved but the other rights of the
 
29
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
parties have not been adjudicated, is quite common.
Under present law, in the event one party to that
divorce were to die before the division of the
 property was completed, intervening rights of a new
spouse could have attached. This hiatus should be
 eliminated by statutory enactment.
The proposed language reserves to a former
spouse the rights to dower and curtesy presently
granted by Hawaii Revised Statutes until the entry of
a Decree which finally divides the property of the
parties to the former marriage.
 . . . .
 
The bill clearly indicates that this right to
dower or curtesy will extend only for a period of one
year of the entry of a decree or order reserving the
final division of property.
 
S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 852, in 1973 Senate Journal, at 967-68
 
(emphasis added); see H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 618, in 1973 House
 Journal, at 1045.
 
Thus, it appears that the Legislature sought to clarify
 
who would have a dower or curtesy interest where property
 division issues were not resolved, but a divorced spouse
 remarried and later died before the property division in the
 former marriage was resolved. As this court explained in Magoon
 v. Magoon, 70 Haw. 605, 613, 780 P.2d 80, 84-85 (1989), HRS
 § 580-56(c) “serves to prevent the attachment of intervening
 dower or curtesy rights in the event a party remarries before the
 property division is effected; it bars the right of dower or
 curtesy ‘to a subsequently acquired spouse until the property of
 the parties [to the pending action] has been finally divided[.]’” 
(Brackets in original). Under the 1973 amendments, the
 decedent’s former spouse would continue to have a dower or
 curtesy right in the deceased spouse’s real and personal estate
 for one year after the filing of the divorce decree. 1973 Haw.
 
30
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Sess. Laws Act 192, § 2 at 333-34; HRS § 580-56(c)-(d) (1973). 
Under the predecessor statute, RLH § 324-45, the subsequent wife
 would immediately have rights in the property, although the
 former wife may otherwise have been entitled to a share of the
 property if her spouse had not died before the property was
 finally divided.
 
Therefore, the legislative history and statutory scheme
 
indicate that HRS § 580-56(d) was meant to apply solely in the
 context of a spouse’s right to dower or curtesy after a divorce.
7
 
2. Boulton should be overruled
 
In 1986, thirteen years after HRS § 580-56 was
 
recodified and amended, this court held in Boulton that HRS
 
§ 580-56(d) divested the family court of jurisdiction to divide a
 former spouse’s “personal estate” one year after the filing of a
 divorce decree reserving property division. 69 Haw. at 5, 730
 P.3d at 340. There, the family court granted a divorce decree in
 January 1984, but it did not immediately resolve the issue of
 property division. Id. at 3, 730 P.2d at 339. The case “lay
 
dormant” in the family court for over a year before the husband
 served a request for the wife to produce documents. Id. The
 
7
 As mentioned supra note 4, dower and curtesy were sharply
 
restricted in 1977. However, under the Uniform Probate Code, which was
enacted in 1977, a surviving spouse still has an interest in the estate of a
deceased spouse. See, e.g., HRS §§ 560:2-102 (2006) (concerning a surviving
spouse’s right to an intestate share), 560:2-202 (2006) (concerning a
surviving spouse’s right to an elective share), 560:2-301 (2006) (concerning
the rights of a surviving spouse unprovided for in a will). Because the
 question of whether HRS § 580-56(d) extends to the rights of a surviving
spouse under the Uniform Probate Code is not before us, we do not reach that
issue.

husband sought division of real property that had been owned by

§ 580-56(d). Id. The family court construed the statute “to

On appeal, the husband argued that the phrase “dower or

 real estate” and the “former spouse’s personal estate.” 69 Haw.
 at 3, 730 P.2d at 339. Under this construction, HRS § 580-56(d)
 only applied to dower and curtesy rights, rather than any other
 rights that a spouse might have in the other’s property. This
 court rejected the husband’s argument, and instead held that the
 statute should be read as: “[f]ollowing . . . the elapse of one
 year after entry of a decree or order reserving the final
 division of property of the party, a divorced spouse shall not be
 entitled . . . to any share of the former spouse’s personal
 estate.”

The parallel wording of the phrases “to any dower or
curtesy in the former spouse’s real estate” and “to
any share of the former spouse’s personal estate”
indicates that each modifies the previous portion of
the sentence requiring resolution within one year.
Thus, we read the plain wording of the statute to be,
“[f]ollowing ... the elapse of one year after entry of
a decree or order reserving the final division of
property of the party, a divorced spouse shall not be
entitled ... to any share of the former spouse's
personal estate.”

estate’ only refer[red] to a deceased person’s hereditament,
 
rather than a living person’s property.” Id. at 4, 730 P.2d at
 
340. This court noted that it was not clear whether the term
 
“personal estate” applied to the property of both living and
 deceased persons, and noted that the term was not defined in HRS
 chapter 580. Id. Furthermore, because there was no legislative
 
history to guide it in construing the term “personal estate,”
 this court looked to case law interpreting the term “personal
 estate” in the context of divorce actions, and determined that
 “personal estate” in HRS § 580-56(d) included “property of living
 persons.” Id. at 4-5, 730 P.2d at 340. This court then held
 
that real property constituted part of the “personal estate” for
 purposes of HRS § 580-56(d), and thus, needed to be divided
 within the one year limitation stated in the statute. Id. at 4,
 
730 P.2d at 340. Accordingly, this court concluded that the
 family court did not have jurisdiction to resolve the parties’
 property division because it failed to divide the property within
 one year of filing the divorce decree. Id. at 5, 730 P.2d at
 
340.
 
In his dissent in Boulton, Justice Wakatsuki analyzed
 
the legislative history of HRS § 580-56(d) and concluded that “it
 [wa]s clear [] that the 1973 amendment was directed only at
 preserving dower and curtesy rights in the former spouse prior to
 property division, and that the one-year period was intended as
 an outside time limit on those dower and curtesy rights only.” 
33
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
69 Haw. at 7, 730 P.2d at 341 (emphasis in original) (Wakatsuki,
 
J., dissenting). Justice Wakatsuki continued:
 
The majority’s application of the “dower or
curtesy” phrase to only real estate and not personal
estate means that under the pre-1973 statute a wife
could not share in any of her husband’s property after
a divorce decree was entered. In other words, the
majority’s construction would make property division
after the dissolution of the marriage impossible.
Therefore, the one-year cut-off should apply
only to dower and curtesy rights in the real and
personal estate of the former spouse. Because neither
 dower nor curtesy is involved here, the lower court
improperly dismissed the case.
 
Id.
 
We take this opportunity to reexamine HRS § 580-56(d) 
and this court’s application of that statute in Boulton. At 
best, the language of HRS § 580-56(d) is ambiguous as to whether it applies only to a dower and curtesy interest in a former spouse’s personal estate or whether it also applied to the personal estate of living persons. Where a statute is ambiguous, we look to the legislative history for guidance to determine the legislature’s intent. See Wheeler, 121 Hawai
'i at 390, 219 P.3d 
at 1177 (holding that “the meaning of the ambiguous words may be sought by examining the context, with which the ambiguous words, phrases, and sentences may be compared, in order to ascertain their true meaning. Moreover, the courts may resort to extrinsic aids in determining legislative intent, such as legislative history, or the reason and spirit of the law”) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). As previously discussed, the legislative history and statutory scheme of HRS § 580-56 clearly indicate that the limited purpose of the statute was to 
34
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
impose a one year limit only on the family court’s jurisdiction
 
to award dower and curtesy. See 1973 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 192,
 
§ 2 at 333-34; S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 852, in 1973 Senate
 Journal, at 967-68; H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 618, in 1973 House
 Journal, at 1045. Nothing in the legislative history suggests
 that the legislature intended the statute to divest the family
 court of jurisdiction to divide all of the former spouse’s
 property.
 
In determining that the phrase “dower or curtesy”
 
applied only to the former spouse’s real estate, the Boulton
 majority broadened the scope of HRS § 580-56(d) to apply the
 limitations period to the division of the former spouse’s entire
 personal estate, rather than only that portion of the personal
 estate in which a former spouse had a “dower or curtesy” right. 
This interpretation is inconsistent with the legislative history
 of HRS § 580-56(d).
9
 
Moreover, the majority’s interpretation effectively
 
deleted the phrase “dower or curtesy in the former spouse’s real
 estate” from HRS § 580-56(d). See Boulton, 69 Haw. at 4, 730
 
P.2d at 339 (“[W]e read the plain wording of the statute to be,

 We note that this court’s holding in Boulton also conflicts with 
the partnership model of marital property division. Under partnership
principles, property acquired during the marriage that is not marital separateproperty belongs to the marital partnership and not to the “former spouse.”See Hussey v. Hussey, 77 Hawai' i 202, 206-07, 881 P.2d 1270, 1274-75 (App.
1994), overruled on other grounds by State v. Gonsales, 91 Hawai' i 446, 984
P.2d 1272 (App. 1999). However, under the interpretation of HRS § 580-56(d)set forth in Boulton, marital partnership property that is not distributedwithin one year of the divorce decree would default to the spouse in whosename the property is titled, and thus would not be divided pursuant topartnership principles. 
35
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
‘[f]ollowing . . . the elapse of one year after entry of a decree 
or order reserving the final division of property of the party, a divorced spouse shall not be entitled . . . to any share of the former spouse’s personal estate.’”). The Boulton majority’s interpretation essentially rendered the phrase surplusage. See 
Potter v. Hawaii Newspaper Agency, 89 Hawai
'i 411, 422, 974 P.2d 
51, 62-63 (1999) (“Our rules of statutory construction require us to reject an interpretation of [a] statute that renders any part of the statutory language a nullity.”). 
Furthermore, as Justice Wakatsuki noted, “[t]he
 
majority’s application of the ‘dower or curtesy’ phrase to only
 real estate and not personal estate means that under the pre-1973
 statute a wife could not share in any of her husband’s property
 after a divorce decree was entered.” Boulton, 69 Haw. at 7, 730
 
P.2d at 341 (Wakatsuki, J., dissenting). As discussed supra,
 prior to its recodification as HRS § 580-56, RLH § 324-45 was
 entitled “[f]orfeiture of dower” and provided, “[a] wife divorced
 shall not be entitled to dower in her husband’s real estate, or
 any part thereof, nor to any share of his personal estate.” This
 language was clearly limited only to a wife’s dower interest,
 which, as stated above, was an interest that arose only upon the
 death of a husband. See Richards, 44 Haw. at 504, 355 P.2d at
 
196. However, if the Boulton majority’s analysis were applied to
 
RLH § 324-45, a wife’s interest in all of her former spouse’s
 property would cease immediately upon divorce, even if the former
 
36
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
spouse were still living.10
 
Accordingly, we disagree with the reasoning of the
 
Boulton majority. We, therefore, overrule Boulton, and hold that
 
HRS § 580-56(d) does not limit the family court’s jurisdiction to
 divide the property at issue in the instant case.
11
 
B.	 The ICA lacked jurisdiction to consider Riethbrock’s
contention that the family court erred in granting Lange’s
motion to release funds from escrow
 
In its SDO, the ICA held that it lacked jurisdiction to
 
address “Riethbrock’s second point of error . . . concerning the
 
January 23, 2007 Order Granting Ex Parte Motion Releasing
 Defendant’s Funds From Escrow [that] arose two months after the
 notice of appeal was filed.” Riethbrock, 2011 WL 3455829, at *3. 
10 Contrary to the Boulton majority’s construction, the legislative
 
history to the 1973 amendments noted that “[t]he divisible divorce, that is
where the marriage is dissolved but the other rights of the parties have not
been adjudicated, is quite common.” S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 852, in 1973
Senate Journal, at 967; H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 618, in 1973 House Journal,
at 1045. 
11 We further note that, even under the holding in Boulton,
 
Riethbrock’s argument is without merit because the family court implicitly
divided the Pukalani property before the one year limitations period elapsed.
The family court entered its stipulated divorce decree on August 8, 2005. It
 subsequently implicitly divided the Pukalani property in various orders,
including its June 8, 2006 order, in which it ruled that: “all future child
support (approximately seventeen years) plus [Riethbrock’s] one-half share of
college expenses shall be taken from [Riethbrock’s] one-half share of the
property sale proceeds.”
The family court also “defaulted” Riethbrock on the issue of
Lange’s interest in the Pukalani property. In defaulting Riethbrock on this
issue and determining in multiple orders that Riethbrock’s one-half share of
the sale proceeds of the Pukalani property should be set aside for child
support, the family court timely and finally divided the Pukalani property
within the one year period required under Boulton.
In Richter, the ICA held that the one year limitation in HRS
§ 580-56(d), as interpreted in Boulton, only applied to the family court’sjurisdiction to “decide how the property of the parties will bedistributed[,]” but did not limit the family court’s jurisdiction to enforcethe property division orders. 108 Hawai' i at 506-07, 122 P.3d at 286-87
(emphasis added). Here, the family court timely divided the property underthe holding in Boulton, and thus had jurisdiction under the holding in Richterto enforce its prior orders by ordering the sale of the Pukalani property. 
37
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Riethbrock appears to argue that the ICA “committed grave
 
constitutional error [in] deciding it lacked jurisdiction”
 because his second notice of appeal, which was filed on
 August 20, 2007 (Case No. 28694), and which the ICA consolidated
 with the present case, “brought up for review . . . one of the
 four distinct parts of a divorce case[.]” As discussed below,
 the ICA did not err in failing to address Riethbrock’s second
 point of error regarding the January 23, 2007 Order because the
 ICA lacked jurisdiction to entertain Riethbrock’s contention.
 
Riethbrock filed two notices of appeal. In his first
 
Notice of Appeal (Case No. 28289), filed November 24, 2006,
 Riethbrock appealed the family court’s October 26, 2006 Order
 Denying Pending Motions, in which the court denied Riethbrock’s
 motion for stay on the ground that it had implicitly divided the
 Pukalani property in its previous orders. On August 20, 2007,
 Riethbrock filed his second Notice of Appeal (Case No. 28694), in
 which he challenged the family court’s July 24, 2007 Order
 Pertaining to Request for Attorney’s Fees that mandated that
 Riethbrock pay Lange’s attorney’s fees.
12 Neither Notice of
 
Appeal challenged the family court’s January 23, 2007 Order
 Granting Ex Parte Motion Releasing Lange’s Funds From Escrow. 
In Cook v. Surety Life Ins., Co., 79 Hawai
'i 403, 409, 
12
 As noted supra, the ICA consolidated Case No. 28694 with Case No.
 
28289. Inasmuch as Riethbrock does not challenge the ICA’s ruling on the
issues presented in Case No. 28694, we do not discuss them further. See HRAP
 
Rule 40.1(d)(1).
 
38
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
903 P.2d 708, 714 (App. 1995), the ICA held that when a party
 
appeals from a single order, “this court will only consider other
 orders which were preliminary rulings upon which the subject
 Order was predicated or were part of the series of orders which
 collectively led to that Order.” (Emphasis added); cf. Weinberg
 v. Mauch, 78 Hawai
'i 40, 46, 890 P.2d 277, 283 (1995) (holding 
that when an order is properly certified under HRCP Rule 54(b), the certification “necessarily render[s] every preliminary ruling upon which it was predicated final and appealable as well”) (citation omitted); Security Pac. Mortgage Corp. v. Miller, 71 Haw. 65, 71, 783 P.2d 855, 858 (1989) (noting that review is limited to the scope of the orders appealed from). Here, the January 23, 2007 Order was not a “preliminary ruling[]” upon which the subject Order “was predicated[.]” First, the January 23, 2007 Order cannot be considered a “preliminary” ruling to the October 26, 2006 Order because it was filed later. Black’s Law Dictionary 1299 (9th ed. 2009) (defining “preliminary” as “[c]oming before” and usually “leading up to the main part of something”). Second, although the January 23, 2007 order was “preliminary” to the July 24, 2007 order, the January 23, 2007 Order was not an order upon which the July 24, 2007 attorney’s fees order “was predicated” because it dealt with a separate and unrelated issue, i.e., authorizing escrow to release funds. Accordingly, the ICA lacked jurisdiction to address Riethbrock’s arguments relating to the January 23, 2007 
39
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Order.
 
In addition, Riethbrock’s reliance on Eaton v. Eaton, 7
 
Haw. App. 111, 748 P.2d 801 (1987), for the proposition that the
 
second Notice of Appeal brought up for review the January 23,
 2007 Order “as one of the four distinct parts of a divorce case”
 is misplaced. In Eaton, the ICA determined that there are four
 distinct parts of a divorce case: “(1) dissolution of the
 marriage; (2) child custody, visitation, and support; (3) spousal
 support; and (4) division and distribution of property and
 debts.” 7 Haw. App. at 118, 748 P.2d at 805. The ICA also
 concluded that “parts (2), (3), and (4) are each separately final
 and appealable as and when they are decided, but only if part (1)
 has previously or simultaneously been decided[.]” Id. at 118-19,
 
748 P.2d at 805. Citing Eaton and without more, Riethbrock
 appears to argue that the family court’s January 23, 2007 Order
 was a “final appealable order or part.” However, Riethbrock
 never filed a notice of appeal from this “final appealable order
 or part.” As such, Riethbrock’s reliance on Eaton is misplaced.
 
Inasmuch as the ICA properly concluded that it lacked 
jurisdiction to entertain Riethbrock’s contentions, we do not address Riethbrock’s remaining arguments that the family court’s January 23, 2007 order violated his due process rights, equal protection rights, Hawai
'i Family Court Rules 5 and 7, and the 
family court’s own November 20, 2006 Order.

IV. Conclusion
 
In sum, Boulton wrongly held that HRS § 580-56(d)
 
deprived the family court of jurisdiction to divide all property
 
one year after the filing of a divorce decree. We therefore
 overrule Boulton and hold that HRS § 580-56(d) does not limit the
 family court’s jurisdiction to divide the property at issue in
 the instant case. Accordingly, the family court properly denied
 Riethbrock’s motion for stay and to dismiss. In addition, we
 hold that the ICA did not have jurisdiction to address the family
 court’s January 23, 2007 order releasing funds from escrow. We
 therefore affirm the judgment of the ICA.
