 Kahekili John Krause, Keanu Kaikala Krause, and Kawena Kaikala
 Krause (Collectively, Petitioners) filed a timely application for
 writ of certiorari (Application), urging this court to review the
 Intermediate Court of Appeals’ (ICA) August 11, 2011 judgment on
 appeal in support of its July 28, 2011 Opinion, which dismissed
 Petitioners’ appeal for lack of jurisdiction. 
We accepted the
 
Application on December 5, 2011. Oral argument was held on
 March 15, 2012.
 
Petitioners’ Application presents the following
 
questions:
 
A. DID THE HAWAII INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS COMMIT
 
GRAVE ERROR WHEN IT DISMISSED AN APPEAL FOR LACK OF
 
JURISDICTION DESPITE PETITIONERS’ REASONABLE RELIANCE ON A
 
COURT ORDER EXTENDING TIME TO NOTICE APPEAL UNDER HRAP RULE
 
4(a)(4)(A)?
 
B. SHOULD THIS COURT, AS THE DISSENT PROPOSES, APPLY THE
 
1
 On November 11, 2011, Petitioners’ counsel submitted a notice to
 
this court explaining that although Mark Kale Cabral is listed as a Petitioner
in the caption to the Application, she withdrew from representing him on
November 23, 2007. Thus, Mark Kale Cabral is not a Petitioner in the instant
 appeal.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
DOCTRINE OF UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES TO THIS CASE, SINCE
PETITIONERS REASONABLY RELIED UPON THE COURT’S ORDER
 
EXTENDING TIME TO NOTICE APPEAL UNDER HRAP RULE 4(a)4(A)?
 
C. ALTERNATIVELY, SHOULD THIS COURT FIND THAT RELYING ON AN
INVALID ORDER EXTENDING TIME DURING THE INITIAL 30-DAY
 
PERIOD IS EXCUSABLE NEGLECT, AND UPHOLD THE SECOND EXTENSION
UNDER HRAP RULE 4(a)(4)(B)?
 
(Emphases in original.) 
Based upon the specific, unique factual circumstances
 
of this case, we hold that the ICA erred by concluding that it
 
did not have jurisdiction to hear Petitioners’ appeal. As
 discussed herein, Petitioners in this case relied on a trial
 court’s order that: (1) was issued prior to the expiration of the
 30-day jurisdictional time limit for filing a notice of appeal;
 (2) extended the time to file a notice of appeal; and (3) was
 later deemed invalid. Under these circumstances, we may excuse
 Petitioners’ otherwise untimely notice of appeal. Accordingly,
 we vacate the ICA’s dismissal of Petitioners’ appeal for lack of
 jurisdiction, and remand the case for consideration on the
 
merits. 
I. BACKGROUND
 
This case arises from a July 20, 2000 fatal car 
accident that occurred on Highway 11 in the County of Hawai' i, 
which resulted in the death of Shawn Kaikala (Decedent). 
Decedent’s vehicle was struck by a vehicle driven by Joni Marie Scott (Scott). On October 16, 2001, Petitioners filed a civil 
3
    
       
    
     
            
            
              
         *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
complaint against Scott and Respondent/Defendant-Appellee State 
of Hawai' i (Respondent or State), asserting claims for negligence 
and wrongful death.2 Petitioners settled their claims against 
Scott prior to the commencement of trial. 
A seven-day bench trial began on July 10, 2006. On
 
November 1, 2006, the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit (circuit
 court) entered its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, 
concluding that Petitioners failed to prove by a preponderance of
 the evidence that the State was negligent in the “design,
 
3
construction or maintenance” of Highway 11.  The legal cause of
the accident and resultant death of Decedent was attributed
 solely to the negligence of Scott. On April 20, 2007, the
 circuit court entered judgment in favor of the State and against
 Petitioners. 
A.	 Unique Factual Circumstances 
Ordinarily, and under Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate 
4
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 4(a)(1),  Petitioners would have had until
May 21, 2007 -- 30 days from the circuit court’s April 20, 2007
 
2
 Petitioners consist of Decedent’s boyfriend and family members,
 
including her minor children.
 
3
 The Honorable Glenn S. Hara presided.
 
4
 At the time of the circuit court’s judgment, as it does now, HRAP
 
Rule 4(a)(1) provided, in part, “[w]hen a civil appeal is permitted by law,
the notice of appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment
or appealable order.” HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) (2006).
 
4
    
 
          
          
        
          
              
          
             
            
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
entry of judgment -- to file a timely notice of appeal.5 At the
 
time relevant to Petitioners’ appeal, as it does now, however,
 
HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) provided that “[i]f any party files a timely
 motion . . . to reconsider, . . . the time for filing the notice
 of appeal is extended until 30 days after entry of an order
 disposing of the motion[.]” HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) (2006). In this
 case, Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration on April 30,
 
2007, which was subsequently denied on June 7, 2007.  Thus,
 
Petitioners had 30 days from June 7, 2007 -- the date on which
 
the circuit court filed its order denying Petitioners’ motion for
 reconsideration -- to file a timely notice of appeal. The 30-day
 deadline was July 7, 2007, but because it was a Saturday,
 Petitioners’ deadline to file a notice of appeal became the
 following Monday, July 9, 2007. See HRAP Rule 26(a)(2000). HRAP
 
Rule 4(a)(4)(A) further provides that upon a request for an
 extension of time made prior to the expiration of the 30-day time
 period from the court’s disposal of a motion for reconsideration, 
[t]he court or agency appealed from, upon a showing of good
cause, may extend the time for filing a notice of appeal
upon motion filed within the time prescribed by subsections
(a)(1) and (a)(3) of this rule. However, no such extension
 
shall exceed 30 days past such prescribed time. . . . .
 
5
 Because 30 days from the circuit court’s April 20, 2007 judgment
 
was Sunday, the 30-day period “extend[ed] until the end of the next day that
[was] not a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday[,]” which happened to be
 Monday, May 21, 2007 in this case. HRAP Rule 26(a) (2000).
 
5
    
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(A) (2006) (emphases added). 
Three days before Petitioners’ July 9, 2007 deadline,
 
the parties submitted a written stipulation to extend time to
 
file notice of appeal (Stipulation). Although HRAP Rule
 4(a)(4)(A) specifies that a request for an extension of time may
 be granted upon motion, and upon a showing of good cause,
 Petitioners made their request via the Stipulation signed by both
 counsel for the parties, and neglected to state the underlying
 basis or need for the extension of time. Despite Petitioners’
 non-compliance with HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(A), the circuit court
 “approved and so ordered” the Stipulation which extended
 Petitioners’ deadline to file a notice of appeal to July 23,
 
2007. 
In an ex-parte motion dated July 18, 2007 (Ex-Parte
 
Motion), Petitioners requested another extension to file their
 
notice of appeal by September 19, 2007. The declaration attached
 to the Ex-Parte Motion stated the need for another extension: the
 parties were involved in settlement negotiations and a hearing on
 a motion to withdraw from representation of one of the Plaintiffs
 was pending and scheduled for hearing on September 5, 2007. The
 circuit court did not rule on the Ex-Parte Motion by July 23,
 2007, and Petitioners, aware of the circuit court’s
 (presumptively valid) July 23, 2007 extended deadline, filed
 
6
    
         
             
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
their notice of appeal on that day.
 
The Ex-Parte Motion, although dated July 18, 2007, was
 
not filed and granted until September 7, 2007. The Ex-Parte
 
Motion was granted on the basis of “good cause,” and Petitioners’
 deadline to file their notice of appeal was extended by the court
 to August 8, 2007.
6 By the time the circuit court granted the Ex-
Parte Motion, however, Petitioners had already filed their notice
 of appeal.
 
Significantly, the above facts reveal that Petitioners’
 
notice of appeal was filed based on reliance on the circuit
 court’s order extending the deadline to July 23, 2007. Notably,
 the record shows that Petitioners were cognizant of the deadlines
 for appeal in this case: (1) Petitioners requested an extension
 three days prior to the expiration of the original July 9, 2007
 deadline; and (2) when the circuit court had not ruled on the Ex-
Parte Motion (seeking another extension) by July 23, 2007 -- the
 date of the presumptively valid extended deadline -- Petitioners
 filed what they assumed to be a timely notice of appeal on that
 date. Thus, had the circuit court not “approved and so ordered”
 the Stipulation extending Petitioners’ deadline to July 23, 2007,
 Petitioners could have, and likely would have, filed their notice
 
6
 The deadline in the circuit court’s order granting the Ex-Parte
 
Motion was scratched out and amended by hand to reflect a deadline of August
8, 2007.
 
7
     
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
of appeal within the original June 9, 2007 deadline.
 
B. Appeal to the ICA
 
Petitioners filed their opening brief with the ICA on
 
March 14, 2008, challenging the circuit court’s findings of fact
 and conclusions of law regarding the underlying tort claim. 
Although the State did not challenge the Petitioners’ statement
 regarding appellate jurisdiction, the ICA sua sponte raised the
 issue of jurisdiction and requested supplemental briefings. Both
 parties filed the requested supplemental briefs. 
In their supplemental brief, the Petitioners argued
 
that the circuit court’s order extending the deadline to file a
 notice of appeal to July 23, 2007 was entitled to great
 deference. Petitioners argued that their notice of appeal was
 filed in reliance of the extended July 23, 2007 deadline -- the
 date on which they filed what was assumed to be a timely notice
 of appeal. Petitioners further contended that any untimeliness
 of their notice of appeal was cured by the circuit court’s
 September 7, 2007 order granting the Ex-Parte Motion, which
 extended the deadline to notice the appeal to August 8, 2007. 
In its supplemental brief, Respondent argued that the
 
ICA did not have jurisdiction to hear Petitioners’ appeal. 
Respondent admitted that while it stipulated to the extended July
 23, 2007 deadline, the present issue was a matter of
 
8
    
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
jurisdiction, which “can neither be agreed to nor waived by the
 
parties.” Respondent argued that the Stipulation to extend the
 filing deadline was improperly granted because Petitioners
 neglected to state any justification for the extension of time,
 and thus, did not show “good cause.” Respondent also argued that
 the circuit court’s September 7, 2007 order granting Plaintiffs’
 Ex-Parte Motion could not have cured an untimely notice of
 appeal. Respondent argued that the Ex-Parte Motion was granted
 under the inapplicable standard of “good cause,” and that under
 the appropriate “excusable neglect” standard, Petitioners could
 
not have prevailed. 
In an Opinion dated July 28, 2011, the majority of the
 
ICA (Judges Fujise and Leonard) agreed with Respondent and
 
concluded that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal. 
See generally Cabral v. State, No. 28669 2011 WL 3250567, at *2­*5 (Op. 2011). The ICA held that absent a finding of “good
 cause,” it was improper for the circuit court to grant the
 Stipulation extending Petitioners’ deadline to file a notice of
 appeal to July 23, 2007. Id. at *2-*4. Thus, the ICA considered
 
July 9, 2007 as Petitioners’ deadline to file the notice of 
appeal, and Petitioners’ subsequent notice of appeal filed on
 July 23, 2007 was thus untimely. 
The ICA majority further concluded that Petitioners’
 
9
    
         
        
       
         
         
        
       
         *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Ex-Parte Motion was improperly granted because: (1) the circuit
 
court erroneously applied the standard of “good cause” rather
 than “excusable neglect[;]” and (2) under the proper standard,
 excusable neglect could not be found where the Ex-Parte Motion
 was based on “the continued efforts at settlement and a pending
 motion to withdraw.” Id. at *4. Petitioners’ appeal was
 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. Id. at *5. 
In his dissent, Chief Judge Nakamura agreed that the
 
circuit court erroneously approved the Stipulation without a
 finding of good cause. Id. (Nakamura, J., dissenting). The
 
dissent, however, citing case law from the United States Supreme
 Court, stated that 
in the limited circumstances presented here -- where (1) an
appellant seeks and obtains a court order extending the
filing deadline before the expiration of the [filing]
deadline; (2) the appellant files the notice of appeal in
compliance with the court’s order; and (3) there is no
showing that the extension prejudiced the appellee -- I
 would recognize an equitable exception to the strict
enforcement of time limits for filing a notice of appeal.
 
Id. (emphasis in original). The dissent emphasized that it was
 
reasonable for Petitioners to rely on the circuit court’s order
 issued prior to the original deadline, which extended
 Petitioners’ time to file a notice of appeal to July 23, 2007:
 The appellate court “require[s] and expect[s] parties to comply
 with court orders. [The appellate court] should permit them to
 rely on court orders in determining whether the time for filing a
 
10
  
    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
notice of appeal has expired.” Id. at *6. The dissent noted 
that had the circuit court denied the Stipulation, Petitioners
 
could have, and presumably would have, filed a notice of appeal
 before the expiration of the original July 9, 2007 deadline. Id.
 
at *7. 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
A Trial Court’s Interpretation of The Rules Governing the
Extension of Time
 
Although a trial court’s decision to grant an extension 
of time to file a notice of a appeal is reviewed under an abuse 
of discretion standard, its interpretation of the rules governing such extensions is reviewed de novo. Hall v. Hall, 95 Hawai' i 
318, 318-19, 22 P.3d 965, 965-66 (2001). 
III. DISCUSSION 
Petitioners contend that their appeal was timely filed
 
and that the case should be decided on its merits because: (1)
 the circuit court’s July 6, 2007 order extending the deadline to
 file a notice of appeal to July 23, 2007 was valid; and (2)
 Petitioners’ notice of appeal was filed on that date. 
Petitioners alternatively contend that any defect regarding the
 July 23, 2007 deadline entitles them to equitable relief under
 the “unique circumstances” doctrine. We hold that, although the
 order extending the deadline was not valid, the circumstances of
 
11
    
          
          
        
          
            
   
            
      *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
this case warrant application of the equitable “unique
 
circumstances” doctrine as an exception to the strict enforcement
 of the procedural requirements for extending the time to file a
 notice of appeal. 
A.	 The Circuit Court Erred In Approving The Stipulation And
Extending The Deadline To File A Notice Of Appeal.
 
As discussed earlier herein, HRAP Rule 4 governs the
 
procedure for appeals taken in civil cases.
7 At the time the
 
circuit court’s judgment was entered, HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) provided,
 
in part, “[w]hen a civil appeal is permitted by law, the notice
 of appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the
 judgment or appealable order.” HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) (2006). 
Pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(3), however, the filing of a notice of
 appeal may be extended until 30 days after the disposal of a
 timely motion for reconsideration. HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) (2006). If
 a request for an extension of time is made prior to the
 expiration of the 30-day prescribed time period,
 
[t]he court or agency appealed from, upon a showing of good
cause, may extend the time for filing a notice of appeal
upon motion filed within the time prescribed by subsections
(a)(1) and (a)(3) of this rule. However, no such extension
shall exceed 30 days past such prescribed time. . . .
 
HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(A) (2006) (emphases added). 
7
 The version of the HRAP Rules effective as of July 1, 2006 is
 
applicable to the instant case.
 
12
    
            
              
               
          
           
            *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Here, the circuit court’s April 20, 2007 judgment in 
favor of Respondent and dismissing all other claims, constituted 
an appealable final judgment. See Jenkins v. Cades Schutte 
Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119-20, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338-39 
(1994). Pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 
8
59(e) , Petitioners filed a timely motion for reconsideration on
April 30, 2007, which was subsequently denied on June 7, 2007. 
Thus, Petitioners’ deadline to file a notice of appeal became
 July 7, 2007 -- 30 days from the denial of the motion for
 reconsideration. 
HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) (2006). Because July 7, 2007
 
was a Saturday, however, the deadline to notice the appeal
 expired on Monday, July 9, 2007.
9 See HRAP Rule 26(a).
 
As noted earlier herein, three days prior to the
 
expiration of the July 9, 2007 deadline, the parties submitted
 the Stipulation to obtain an extension of time. On the same day,
 the circuit court “approved and so ordered” the Stipulation,
 which purported to extend the filing deadline to July 23, 2007.
 Petitioners filed their notice of appeal on July 23, 2007. Thus,
 
8
 At the time of the circuit court’s judgment, as it does now, HRCP
 
Rule 59(e) stated: “Any motion to alter or amend judgment shall be filed no
later than 10 days after entry of the judgment.” HRCP Rule 59(e) (2000).
 
9
 It appears that the ICA majority neglected to consider HRAP Rule
 
26(a) because it deemed Saturday, July 7, 2007 as Petitioners’ deadline to
 file a notice of appeal. See Cabral 2011 WL 3250567, at *2.
 
13
    
       
          
       
          
    
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
it is clear that Petitioners’ notice of appeal was timely filed
 
if the circuit court properly “approved and so ordered” the
 extended July 23, 2007 deadline.
 
Although Petitioners argue that no rule or case law in
 
this jurisdiction expressly prohibits parties from using a
 stipulation to request an extension of time, HRAP Rule 4 states
 the requirements for obtaining such an extension. We agree with
 the ICA that HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(A) clearly states that the court
 may extend the time for filing a notice of appeal upon motion,
 and upon a finding of good cause. 
Here, Petitioners filed a stipulation, rather than a
 
motion as required by HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(A), when they sought an
 extension of time to file their notice of appeal. In its
 
entirety, the Stipulation read as follows:
 
Plaintiffs, above-named, by and through their attorney, JOY
A. SAN BUENAVENTURA; and the State of Hawaii, by and through
its attorney, Deputy Attorney General ROBIN KISHI hereby
stipulate to the extension of time to file a notice of
a
ppeal of two weeks.
 
There was no mention of any grounds for the extension, much less
 
one demonstrating “good cause,” and the court order extending the
 time for filing the notice of appeal did not include a finding of
 good cause. Accordingly, the circuit court erred when it ordered
 the extended July 23, 2007 deadline.
 
14
     
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
B.	 Petitioners’ Appeal Should Be Decided On The Merits.
 
Under the specific, unique factual circumstances of
 
this case, Petitioners urge us to adopt the “unique
 
circumstances” doctrine to excuse their untimely notice of
 appeal. Petitioners contend that they should not be penalized
 for their reliance on the circuit court’s order extending the
 deadline to file a notice of appeal to July 23, 2007:
 
The  July  6,  2007  order  was  granted  3  days  before  the  appeal
expired;[] and  thus,  had  the  stipulated  order  been  denied,
Petitioners  would  have  had  an  opportunity  to  file  a  notice
of  appeal  within  the  time  period  granted  by  this  order.
  
We agree. 
1. 	We apply the equitable “unique circumstances” doctrine
to the specific, unique factual circumstances of the
present case
 
The United States Supreme Court previously recognized
 
the “unique circumstances” doctrine as an equitable exception to
 
a time limit for filing a notice of appeal under federal law. 
See Harris Truck Lines, Inc. v. Cherry Meat Packers, Inc., 371
 U.S. 215 (1962); see also Thompson v. Immigration &
 Naturalization Serv., 375 U.S. 384 (1964). In Harris, the
 appellant requested an extension of time prior to the expiration
 of an original 30-day deadline to file a notice of appeal. 
Harris, 371 U.S. at 216. The need for an extended deadline was
 due to “trial counsel’s inability to contact the general counsel
 
15
    
           
        
          
         
          
         
        
        *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
in order to ask whether to appeal[.]” Id. The trial court
 
granted the two week extension, and appellant thereafter filed
 
its notice of appeal after the expiration of the original
 deadline, but within the extended deadline. Id. The Court of
 
Appeals dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. It held
 that appellant’s notice of appeal was untimely because it had not
 shown “excusable neglect,” which was required by the applicable
 rule to extend the time for appeal. Id. The Supreme Court
 
reversed the Court of Appeals and held as follows:
 
In view of the obvious great hardship to a party who relies
upon the trial court’s finding of ‘excusable neglect’ prior
to the expiration of the 30-day period and then suffers a
reversal of the finding, it should be given great deference
by the reviewing court. Whatever the proper result as an
initial matter on the facts here, the record contains a
showing of unique circumstances sufficient that the Court of
Appeals ought not to have disturbed the motion judge’s
ruling.
 
Id. at 217. The dismissal was reversed and the case was remanded
 
with instructions that it be heard on its merits. Id. 
Similarly, in Thompson, the appellant served his post­
trial motions, including a motion for a new trial, two days late. 
375 U.S. at 384-85. These motions were ultimately denied, but
 the trial court declared the motions timely. Id. at 385. 
Appellant, relying on the assurance that his motions were made
 “in ample time,” filed his notice of appeal within the prescribed
 time from the denial of his post-trial motions, but not before
 the expiration of time from the original entry of judgment. Id. 
16
    
         
           
         
         
          
         
        
           
        
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal because it was not
 
filed within the time limits as required under the applicable
 rules. Id. 
The Supreme Court vacated the Court of Appeals’
 
judgment and remanded the case to be heard on the merits:
 
The instant cause fits squarely within the letter and spirit
of Harris. Here, as there, petitioner did an act, which, if
properly done, postponed the deadline for the filing of his
appeal. Here, as there, the District Court concluded that
the act had been properly done. Here, as there, the
petitioner relied on the statement of the District Court and
filed the appeal within the assumedly new deadline but
beyond the old deadline. And here, as there, the Court of
Appeals concluded that the District Court had erred and
dismissed the appeal.
 
Id. at 387.
 
In a recent five to four majority opinion by Justice
 
Thomas, the United States Supreme Court overruled the use of the
 
“unique circumstances” doctrine to excuse untimely notices of
 appeal in civil cases. See Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 206­
07 (2007). In Bowles, the petitioner’s application for federal
 habeas corpus relief was denied, and he failed to file a notice
 of appeal within 30 days after the entry of judgment. Id. at
 
207. The petitioner moved to reopen the filing period under
 
Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure (FRAP) Rule 4(a)(6) (1998)
 and 28 U.S.C. § 2107(c) (1991), which allows a trial court to
 grant a 14-day extension when certain conditions are met. Id. 
The district court granted the motion, but gave the petitioner 17
 
17
    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
days to file a notice of appeal, rather than the maximum 14 days
 
as prescribed under FRAP Rule 4(a)(6) and 28 U.S.C. § 2107(c). 
Id. Petitioner filed his notice of appeal within the 17 days
 
allowed by the district court, but after the 14-day period had
 expired. Id. Respondent thereafter moved to dismiss the appeal
 
as untimely. Petitioner argued that his untimeliness should be
 excused based on his justifiable reliance on the trial court’s
 order. The Court of Appeals held that petitioner’s notice of
 appeal was untimely and that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the
 case. Id. at 207-08.
 
In affirming the Court of Appeals’ decision, the
 
majority of the Supreme Court clarified the difference between
 time limit rules that are “jurisdictional” and those that are
 “claim-processing.” Id. at 210-12. The Supreme Court emphasized
 
that only Congress may determine a lower federal court’s subject-
matter jurisdiction. Id. at 211. It cited United States v.
 
Curry, 47 U.S. 106, 113 (1848), for the proposition that when
 appeals are not “prosecuted in the manner directed, within the
 time limited by the acts of Congress, it must be dismissed for
 want of jurisdiction.” Bowles, 551 U.S. at 210. As such, the
 
Court stated that the rules regarding time constraints that are
 derived from statutes specifically limiting a court’s
 jurisdiction are considered “jurisdictional.” Id. at 210-13.

          *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
“Claim-processing” rules related to time restrictions, on the
 
other hand, are “court-promulgated” and adopted by the Court for
 the orderly transaction of business. Id. at 211. Such rules are
 
not derived from statutory time constraints specifically limiting
 jurisdiction, and can be relaxed at the Court’s discretion. Id.
 
at 211-13. 
The time constraints in FRAP Rule 4(a)(6) were declared
 
“jurisdictional” because they are set forth by statute in 28
 U.S.C. § 2107(c), which limits the amount of time federal
 district courts can extend the notice of appeal period. See id.
 
at 213. At the time of the petitioner’s appeal, FRAP Rule
 4(a)(6) read:
 
(6) Reopening the Time to File an Appeal. The district court
may reopen the time to file an appeal for a period of 14
days after the date when its order to reopen is entered, but
only if all the following conditions are satisfied:
 
(A) the motion is filed within 180 days after
the judgment or order is entered or within 7
days after the moving party receives notice of
the entry, whichever is earlier;
 
(B) the court finds that the moving party was
entitled to notice of the entry of the judgment
or order sought to be appealed but did not
receive the notice from the district court or
 any party within 21 days after entry; and
 
(C) the court finds that no party would be
prejudiced.
 
FRAP Rule 4(a)(6) (1998). Similarly, at the relevant time
 
period, 28 U.S.C. § 2107(c) read:
 
(c) the district court may, upon motion filed not later than
30 days after the expiration of the time otherwise set for
 
19
    
           
           
         
        
        
    
      
         
          
        
            
         
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
bringing appeal, extend the time for appeal upon a showing of excusable
neglect or good cause. In addition, if the district court finds-­
(1) that a party entitled to notice of the entry
of a judgment or order did not receive such
notice from the clerk or any party within 21
days of its entry, and
 
(2) that no party would be prejudiced
 
the district court may, upon motion filed within 180 days
after entry of judgment or order or within 7 days after
receipt of such notice, whichever is earlier, reopen the
time for appeal for a period of 14 days from the date of
entry of the order reopening the time for appeal.
 
28 U.S.C. § 2107(c) (1991). Critical to the Supreme Court’s
 
analysis was the fact that the time constraints set forth in FRAP
 rule 4(a)(6) emanated from 28 U.S.C. § 2107(c). Ultimately, the
 Supreme Court ruled that the time limits in FRAP Rule 4(a)(6) are
 “jurisdictional” because it “carries § 2107 into practice.” 
Bowles, 551 U.S. at 208. The Supreme Court majority also
 reiterated that it has “long and repeatedly held that the time
 limits for filing a notice of appeal are jurisdictional in
 
nature.” Id. at 206-07. Even under “unique circumstances,” the
 
majority held, it is without authority to create equitable
 
exceptions to jurisdictional requirements. Id. The use of the
 
“unique circumstances” doctrine was rendered “illegitimate.” Id. 
In dissent, Justice Souter, joined by Justices Stevens,
 
Ginsburg, and Breyer, denounced the unfair result of precluding
 the appeal when petitioner’s appeal was filed within the time
 allowed by the district judge: “It is intolerable for the
 
20
    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
judicial system to treat people this way, and there is not even a
 
technical justification for this bait and switch.” Id. at 215
 
(Souter, J., dissenting). The dissent distinguished the
 majority’s holding from the Court’s “steady stream” of recent
 unanimous decisions that have retreated from the characterization
 of certain filing deadlines as “jurisdictional.” Id. at 219-20;
 
see also Arbaugh v. Y&H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 510 (2006) (stating
 that “time prescriptions, however emphatic, are not properly
 typed ‘jurisdictional[.]’”); see also Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U.S.
 443, 445 (2004) (noting that the use of a “jurisdictional” label
 for “claim processing” rules is inappropriate, and that courts
 should use the former term to describe the classes of cases
 (subject-matter jurisdiction) and the persons (personal
 jurisdiction) falling within the court’s adjudicative capacity);
 see also Eberhart v. United States, 546 U.S. 12 (2005)
 (discussing the basic error of confusing mandatory time limits
 with jurisdictional limitations). Under that trend, the dissent
 argued, the time limit at issue should not be viewed as
 jurisdictional, and the case was entitled to remand for
 consideration on the merits. Bowles, 551 U.S. at 218-19, 223. 
The dissent would have recognized the “unique circumstances”
 doctrine “as it certainly seems reasonable to rely on an order
 from a federal judge.” Id. at 220, 223. 
21
    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Like Harris and Thompson, this case involves the
 
reliance on a trial court’s order that: (1) was issued prior to
 
the expiration of an original deadline; (2) extended the time to
 file a notice of appeal; and (3) was later deemed invalid. 
Accordingly, we apply the equitable “unique circumstances”
 doctrine in the circumstances presented here.
 
We have not previously encountered a situation similar 
to the facts of the present case. Enos v. Pac. Transfer & 
Warehouse, Inc., 80 Hawai' i 345, 910 P.2d 116 (1996), although 
cited in the ICA’s Opinion for the proposition that Petitioners were not entitled to an extension of time, is distinguishable. There, the appellant filed a motion for an extension of time after the original deadline had expired. Id. at 348, 910 P.2d at 
118-19. Consequently, unlike the facts in this case, the appellant could not have relied upon the trial court’s extension order in failing to meet the original deadline to appeal. Rather, the facts of this case are identical to Harris and Thompson, in that Petitioners’ request for an extension of time was filed prior to the expiration of the original deadline. Had the circuit court denied the Stipulation seeking to obtain the extended July 23, 2007 deadline, Petitioners could have, and presumably would have, filed their notice of appeal within the original July 9, 2007 deadline. See Cabral, 2011 WL 3250567, at 
22
    
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
*7 (Nakamura, J., dissenting). In addition, there is no
 
indication that the State was prejudiced, especially in light of
 the fact that they stipulated to the extended deadline. To
 punish Petitioners for their reliance on the circuit court’s
 order, which, unbeknownst to them would later be deemed invalid,
 is unjust: “We require and permit parties to comply with court
 orders. We should permit them to rely on court orders in
 determining whether the time for filing a notice of appeal has
 expired.” Id. at *6.
 
2.	 Our application of the “unique circumstances” doctrine
can be reconciled with the view that a timely notice of
appeal is a jurisdictional requirement
 
As previously discussed, the relevant time constraint
 
in Bowles was statutorily, rather than judicially, created. This
 
was critical to the Supreme Court’s majority determination that
 the time limit to file a notice of appeal was “jurisdictional.” 
The dismissal of petitioner’s appeal was affirmed because the
 Court had no authority to create equitable exceptions to
 jurisdictional limitations set forth in the statute. Bowles, 551
 
U.S. at 214. Had the rule setting forth the time limit been
 adopted “for the orderly transaction of its business[,]” it would
 have been considered a “claim-processing” rule, capable of being
 relaxed in the Court’s discretion. 
In Bowles, FRAP Rule 4(a)(6) was deemed purely
 
23
    
 
           
          
            
             
              *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
“jurisdictional” because it carried the requirements of 28 U.S.C.
 
§ 2107(c)into practice.  Id. Similarly, although the time
 
constraints in HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(A) are set forth by court rule
 
rather than a statute, the authority to set such constraints is
 derived from HRS § 641-1(c), which states that “[a]n appeal shall
 be taken in the manner and within the time provided by the rules
 of court.” HRS § 641-1(c) (1993). Moreover, HRAP Rule 26(b)
 provides, in relevant part, that “no court or judge or justice is
 authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements contained in
 [HRAP] Rule 4.” HRAP Rule 26(b) (2000). Thus, while we do not
 dispute that the time constraints in HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(A) are
 
10
 jurisdictional,  we consider its requirement that a request for
an extension of time be made by motion and for good cause, an
 aspect of “claim-processing.” 
At least one other jurisdiction has similarly
 
reconciled the “unique circumstances” doctrine with the view that
 a timely notice of appeal is a jurisdictional requirement. 
In In
 
re C.A.B.L. et. al., 221 P.3d 433 (Colo. Ct. App. 2009), the
 Colorado appellate court applied the “unique circumstances”
 doctrine to excuse an untimely notice of appeal. Id. at 440. 
10
 Indeed, we have long regarded an untimely notice of appeal as “a
 
jurisdictional defect that can neither be waived by the parties nor
disregarded by the court in the exercise of judicial discretion.” Bacon v.
 
Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1129 (1986) (quoting Naki v. Hawaiian
Elec. Co. , 50 Haw. 85, 86, 431 P.2d 943, 944 (1967)) (brackets omitted).
 
24
    
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
There, a minor child’s grandmother filed a petition for kinship
 
adoption, and the child’s mother (Mother) was divested of her
 
parental rights. Id. at 436. Under the applicable state laws,
 
Mother’s appeal should have been made directly to the Colorado
 
court of appeals. Id. at 437. Nevertheless, the magistrate who
 
initially terminated Mother’s parental rights twice erroneously
 advised her to seek review in the district court. Id. at 440. 
Relying on the magistrate’s advice, Mother filed her petition for
 review with the district court, which ultimately determined that
 it did not have jurisdiction to hear her appeal. Id. 
The Colorado court of appeals, although recognizing
 
that “[t]he timely filing of a notice of appeal is a
 jurisdictional prerequisite to appellate review[,]” noted that in
 “limited circumstances[,]” it is authorized to “grant relief from
 the operation of mandatory language in applicable rules of
 procedure when the failure to comply resulted from the party’s
 reliance on an erroneous district court ruling.” Id. at 439
 
(emphasis added). The court invoked the “unique circumstances”
 doctrine and excused Mother’s untimely notice of appeal, despite
 its acknowledgment that the continuing validity of the doctrine
 
25
    
        
              
              *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
has been called into question.11 Id. at n.1. 
Petitioners in this case were similarly following the
 
circuit court’s order granting them an extended deadline to file
 
their notice of appeal. We acknowledge that Petitioners were not
 in compliance with HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(A) when they filed the
 Stipulation, rather than a motion, and neglected to show “good
 cause” for an extended deadline to file their notice of appeal. 
Nevertheless, we reiterate the distinction between the time
 limits for requesting an extension of time under HRAP Rule 4,
 versus its procedure, the latter of which is not derived from
 statutory time constraints specifically limiting jurisdiction,
 and can be relaxed at the Court’s discretion. See Bowles, 551
 
U.S. at 211-13. 
Petitioners relied, to their detriment, on the order
 
granting an extended July 23, 2007 deadline, and reasonably
 believed that the original July 9, 2007 deadline was no longer
 effective. In light of the circuit court’s order, it is not
 surprising that Petitioners filed their notice of appeal after
 the expiration of the original deadline, but within the
 presumptively valid extended deadline. The State, having
 stipulated to the extended July 23, 2007 deadline, and not
 
11
 The appellate court noted that the “unique circumstances” doctrine
 
was created by the Colorado Supreme Court in 1981, In re C.A.B.L. , 221 P.3d at
439, and that it has not since been abandoned. Id. at n.1.
 
26
    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
challenging appellate jurisdiction until the issue was raised by
 
the ICA, has not been prejudiced. Under the specific, unique
 factual circumstances of this case, we hold that application of
 the equitable doctrine of “unique circumstances” is in the
 interests of justice and appropriate. Having so decided, we need
 not reach the issue of whether the Ex-Parte Motion was properly
 granted.
 
IV. CONCLUSION 
We vacate the ICA’s dismissal, and remand the case for
 
consideration on the merits.
