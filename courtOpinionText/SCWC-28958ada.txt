OPINION OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J. 
  
I. Introduction 
On March 14, 2006, a large portion of the Kaloko Dam 
(“Dam”) in Kīlauea, Kauaʻ i collapsed, releasing over three 
million gallons of water, resulting in the loss of seven lives 
as well as extensive property damage (“Dam Breach”).  At the 
time of the Dam Breach, James Pflueger (“Pflueger”) owned the 
Dam. Pflueger filed a lawsuit in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit seeking damages and indemnification from C. Brewer and 
Company, Ltd. (“C. Brewer” ) for claims brought against him

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWA II REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
arising out of the Dam Breach.  Pflueger v. State,  Civ. No. 06 – 
1–1391 (“Pflueger complaint”).  According to the Pf lueger 
complaint, C. Brewer sold him property, including the Dam, while 
aware of the Dam’s questionable structural stability. C. Brewer 
then filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit (“circuit court”) seek ing rulings regarding obligations owed by 
seventeen insurance companies that had issued various insurance 
policies to C. Brewer covering different time periods. 
This 
opinion addresses issues arising out of the 
policy issued to C. Brewer by James River Insurance Company 
(“James River”), a commercial general liability (“CGL”) policy1 
in effect at the time of the Dam Breach.  The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of James River, ruling that a 
“Designated Premises Endorsement” (“DPE”), which purported to 
limit coverage to specific premises listed in a separate 
“Schedule of Locations” (“Schedule”), precluded coverage.  The 
circuit court ruled that James River was therefore not required 
to defend or indemnify C. Brewer against Pflueger’s claims. On 
1 CGL policies are “third -party” policies, which “provide [] 
coverage for the insured’s liability to another . . . wherein the carrier 
generally assumes a contractual duty to pay judgments recovered against the 
insured arising from the insured’s negligence.”  Sentinel  Ins. Co. v. First 
Ins. Co. of Hawai ʻi, 76 Hawai
ʻi 277, 289, 875 P.2d 894, 906 (1994). 
Generally, a CGL policy “is not limited to accidents on the business 
premises , but rather has at least nationwide coverage.” 3 New Applema n 
Insurance Law Practice Guide § 30.04[3][a] (201 5).  See also  9A Couch on 
Insurance § 129:2 (“Commercial general liability policies are not . . . strictly confined to oper ations performed on the insured’ s business 
premises.”).

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWA II REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
appeal, the Intermediate Court of Appeals (“ ICA”) concluded that 
the parties’ intent as to the DPE was ambiguous, and remanded 
the case for a determination of the parties’ intent regarding 
the DPE. 
James River raised the following question on 
certiorari: 
Did the ICA gravely err when it reversed the circuit 
court’s finding that the “Limitation of Coverage to 
Designated Premises Endorsement” in the James River 
liability policy issued to C. Brewer, considered in the context of the entire policy, unambiguously precludes coverage as a matter of law, for the bodily injury and 
property damage claims stated against C. Brewer in 
underlying actions arising from the March 2006 failure of 
the Ka Loko Dam and Reservoir. 
 
We hold that the James River DPE provides coverage for  
injury and damage that occurs on premises not listed in the 
Schedule if the injury or damage arises out of the ownership, 
maintenance or use  of a designated  premises.  In determining 
whether an injury or damage  arose  out of the use of a designated  
premises, we adopt  the legal interpretation of “arising out of” 
in American Guarantee and Liability Insurance Co. v. 1906 Co. , 
129 F.3d 802 (5th Cir. 1997):  “The phrase ‘arising out of’ is 
ordinarily understood to mean ‘originating from,’ ‘having its 
origin in,’ ‘growing out of,’ or ‘flowing from.’ In the 
insurance context, this phrase is often interpreted to require a causal connection between the injuries alleged and the objects 
made subject to the phrase.”   129 F.3d at 807.  We therefore 
hold that the DPE unambiguously provides coverage for negligence

claims against C. Brewer arising out of the use of designated 
premises. 
We further hold that language in a designated premises 
endorsement “must be clear and unequivocal []” to convert a CGL 
policy to a premises liability policy2 that limits coverage to 
injuries occurring on specific premises. 
Surplus Lines Insurance Co. v. Chabad House of North Dade, Inc., 
771 F. Supp. 2d 1336, 1343 (S.D. Fla. 2011), aff’d
, 450 F. App’x 
792 (11th Cir. 2011)
.  In this case, the DPE is not sufficiently 
“clear and unequivocal” to limit coverage to injuries occurring 
on the designated premises, as argued by James River.  Thus, the 
DPE does not limit liability to injury and damage occurring on 
designated premises. 
Therefore, the circuit court erred in granting summary 
judgment in favor of James River, and the ICA erred in 
concluding that it is necessary to determine the parties’ intent 
2 A premises liability policy is a type of general liability 
insurance that limits coverage to specific premises identified in the policy.  
See 3 New Appleman Insurance Law Practice Guide § 30.04[3][a] (2015) (“Some types of general liability insurance, however, are premises -specific.  The 
most common such policies are Garage policies and policies of Owners’, 
Landlords’ and Tenants’ (“OLT”) insurance.”) A premises liability policy is 
“[a] very common form of liability insurance [] which insures the owner, 
occupier, or operator of real property against liability incident to his ownership or use of the premises .” Am. Guarantee, 129 F.3d at 808 (quoting 
11 Couch on Ins. § 44:379 at 551 (2d. ed. 1982)). 
The purpose of a premises 
liability policy “is simply to protect against liability arising from the 
condition or use of the building as a building[,] [and is] distinguish[able] 
from insurance against liability arising from the nature of the enterprise or activity conducted” in the building itself. Id. (quoting 11 Couch on Ins. § 
44:379
 at 551).

as to the effect of the DPE. Accordingly, we affirm in part and 
vacate in part the ICA’s October 22, 2013 judgment, and instruct 
the circuit court to further proceed consistent with this 
opinion. 
II. Background 
A. Kaloko Dam and Irrigation System 
The Kaloko Irrigation System (“System”) was 
constructed in the late 1800s by Kilauea Sugar Company (“KSC”), 
a C. Brewer subsidiary, to collect and distribute water to 
irrigate sugar cane fields in K īlauea, Kauaʻ i. The System relied 
on rain water from a State-owned mauka3 watershed, which was 
funneled through ditches, flumes, and gates into the Kaloko 
Ditch, then into the Kaloko Reservoir (“Reservoir”). The water 
was held in the Reservoir by the earthen Dam, and then 
distributed through flumes, ditches, and pipes to sugar cane 
4fields makai of the Reservoir. 
KSC exited the sugar cane industry in about 1970 and 
stopped maintaining the System, which then fell into disrepair.  In 1971, C. Brewer began to sell off some of its lands, 
3 In this context, mauka connotes inland or toward the mountains.  
See Mary Kawena Pukui & Samuel H. Elbert, Hawaiian Dictionary  242, 485 
(1986). 
4 In this context, makai means ocean.  See Pukui & Elbert, supra , 
at 225.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWA II REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
specifically those makai of the Dam, which were later developed 
for agricultural or residential uses. 
In 1977, the State of Hawai ʻi (“State”) and C. Brewer 
entered into an agreement that required C. Brewer to, among 
other things, restore and expand the System.5 C. Brewer formed 
the Kilauea Irrigation Company (“KIC”) to satisfy its obligations to the State, revitalize the System, and sell System 
water to local farmers for irrigation. 
In February 1987, KIC entered into a Water Rights 
Agreement (“WRA”) with an owner of property adjoining C. 
Brewer’s land. The WRA made KIC solely responsible for 
operating, inspecting, maintaining, and repairing the System and 
Dam.  In 1987, C. Brewer sold the land under the Reservoir to 
Pflueger. 
B. Circuit Court Proceedings 
James River’s CGL policy was the only policy in effect 
on the date of the Dam Breach. Before filing suit, C. Brewer 
tendered the defense of the Pflueger complaint to James River, 
which refused to defend. 
5 In exchange, the State promised to end its condemnation 
proceedings over certain C. Brewer agricultural parcels in Kilauea.

 40. The Pflueger Complaint alleges that Plaintiff’s 
negligent acts and/or omissions (i.e. failure to inspect, 
maintain, and/or repair the 
dam) caused continuous, 
incremental and indivisible physical injury to tangible property - Pflueger’s dam . . . .  
 41. On January 19, 2007, plaintiffs in the Pflueger 
suit stated in interrogatory responses that the failure of Plaintiff herein failed to maintain the Dam from before 
1982 to March 14, 2006 . . . .  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWA II 
 REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
C. Brewer’s second amended complaint (“complaint”)6 
noted that C. Brewer was a named insured under James River 
policy number 00013398-0, policy period 12/15/2005 to 
12/15/2006. According to the complaint, the insuring agreement 
under the policy stated:  
We will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally 
obligated to pay as damages because of “bodily injury” or 
“property damage” to which this insurance applies.  . . . 
This insurance applies to “bodily injury” and “property 
damage”  only if: (2) The “bodily injury” or “property 
damage” occurs during the policy period[.]  
Accordingly, C. Brewer alleged that the James River policy 
covered claims against it related to the Dam Breach.    C. Brewer  
also asserted that James River was obligated to defend and indemnify it because  none of the policy’s exclusions applied.  
James River moved for summary judgment, arguing inter 
alia, that various endorsements and exclusions in its policy 
precluded coverage for damages from the Dam Breach. 
In 
particular, James River argued that the policy’s DPE limited 
coverage to liability arising out of the ownership, maintenance,  
6 C. Brewer’s complaint alleged the following regarding the 
Pflueger complaint:

   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWA II REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
or use of specifically identified premises.  The Dam site was 
not listed as a designated premises. 
The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of 
James River based upon the DPE, concluding that it unambiguously 
precluded coverage for claims against C. Brewer arising out of 
the Dam Breach, and that, therefore, James River was not 
obligated to provide a defense or coverage to C. Brewer. In 
granting summary judgment, the circuit court concluded that the 
James River policy contained no ambiguous terms, and that C. 
Brewer’s assertion of coverage for claims arising out of the 
“use” of its corporate headquarters exceeded the bounds of the 
plain and ordinary meaning of the policy terms. 
C. Appeal to the ICA 
On appeal, the ICA noted: 
The key question is whether the language ‘arising out of 
the ownership, maintenance, and use of the [designated] 
premises’ can be interpreted to encompass the use of C. 
Brewer’s business headquarters (one of the designated premises) to make negligent business decisions that caused 
personal injury and property damage  outside of the 
designated premises. 
 
C. Brewer & Co. v. Industrial Indem. Co, No. 28958 (App. Aug. 7, 
2013) (mem.), at 34. 
The ICA concluded that the parties’ conflicting 
interpretations of the DPE were reasonable, 
and held the DPE 
ambiguous as being reasonably susceptible to more than one meaning. C. Brewer , mem. op. at 36 (citing Hawaiian Ass’n of 
Seventh-Day Adventists v. Wong  , 130 Hawaiʻ i 36, 45, 305 P.3d 452, 
-9-     
 
   
  
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
      
                         
  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWA II REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
461 (2013)) (“A contract is ambiguous when its terms are 
reasonably susceptible to more than one meaning.”). In so 
concluding, the ICA explained: 
The use of the language “arising out of the ownership, 
maintenance, and use of the premises” suggests that the parties may have intended to restrict coverage to injuries 
and damages occurring on the designated premises.  However, 
the designated premises endorsement applies not only to 
bodily injury and property damage, but also to “personal 
and advertising injury” arising out of the use of the designated premises.  
Id.  The ICA concluded that the inclusion of “advertising 
injury” in the DPE suggested that the parties may have intended 
to include coverage for negligent decisions made at designated 
premises that results in injury and damage elsewhere.  The ICA 
reasoned that while decisions made at C . Brewer’s corporate 
headquarters would likely be the cause of any advertising 
injury, the resulting injury would occur off designated 
premises. Id.   
Accordingly, the ICA held that the James River policy 
was ambiguous as to whether the DPE barred coverage, and thus 
raised a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the 
parties’ intent.7 C. Brewer,  mem. op. at 32, 37. The ICA 
7 In further support of the conclusion that a genuine issue of fact 
with respect to the parties’ intent existed, the ICA stated in a footnote 
that there was “a suggestion in James River’s arguments , based on extrinsic 
circumstances, that C. Brewer was winding up its corporate affairs and thus 
intended to obtain a different kind of CGL policy -- one that would require a lower premium but provide more limited coverage.”   C. Brewer, mem. op. at 37

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWA II REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
therefore vacated the circuit court’s Final Judgment and 
remanded to the circuit court. C. Brewer, mem. op. at 43. 
III. Standard of Review 
This court reviews a circuit court’s grant or denial 
of summary judgment de novo under the same standard applied by 
the circuit court. Dairy Rd. Partners v. Island Ins. Co., 92 
Hawaiʻi 398, 411, 992 P.2d 93, 106 (2000). “[S]ummary judgment 
is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, answers to 
interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the 
affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to 
any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to 
judgment as a matter of law.” Id. (citation omitted). 
This court must view all of the evidence and the 
inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. Maguire v. Hilton Hotels Corp., 79 
Hawaiʻi 110, 112, 899 P.2d 393, 395 (1997). 
IV. Discussion 
A. The Underlying Lawsuit 
The Pflueger complaint alleged that C. Brewer was 
negligent with respect to (1) its obligation to maintain the System and (2) its entrustment of the maintenance and operation 
of the System to KIC, as follows: 
92. Brewer, independently and through its wholly -
owned subsidiary, KIC, owed a duty of reasonable care to 
Plaintiffs and others to properly operate, inspect, repair 
-11-     
 
   
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWA II REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
and/or maintain the System, including the Dam and 
Reservoir. 
93. Brewer, independently and through its wholly -
owned subsidiary, KIC, breached its duty to properly 
operate, inspect, repair and/or maintain the System, 
including the Dam, its appurtenant structures and/or the Reservoir. 
. . . 
96. Brewer owed a duty of reasonable care to 
Plaintiffs and others to ensure the proper operation, inspection, repair and/or maintenance of the System, including the Dam and Reservoir. 
97. After its formation of KIC, Brewer knew or 
reasonably should have foreseen that KIC was not competent 
to operate and maintain the System in general and the Dam 
and Reservoir in particular. 
98. Brewer knew or should have known that, because of 
its lack of expertise, knowledge and/or resources, KIC would operate, inspect, repair and/or maintain the System 
in a manner involving unreasonable risk to others. 
99. Brewer was negligent in its entrustment of the 
System to KIC. 
100. Brewer breached its duty to Plaintiffs and 
others by negligently entrusting KIC with the responsibility to operate, inspect, repair and/or maintain 
the System, including the Reservoir and Dam. 
Therefore, the Pflueger complaint  alleged that C. 
Brewer was obligated to pay Pflueger damages resulting from C. 
Brewer’s negligent acts or omissions , including its negligent 
entrustment of the system to KIC and its   alleged  failure to 
maintain the System, warn about the System’s unsafe conditions,  
and adequately capitalize its land operations and the companies 
responsible for maintaining and repairing the Dam, which 
resulted in injury and  damage due to the Dam  Breach.   
James River’s obligation to indemnify  C. Brewer for  
claims asserted  against it by   the Pflueger complaint  depends 
upon whether the policy covers injury and  damage occurring on 
undesignated premises that results from C. Brewer’s negligent acts or omissions arising from the use of  designated premises.  
-12
-     
 
   
    
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWA II REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
James River’s position is that the DPE precluded any possibility 
that it would be obligated to indemnify C. Brewer.  
B. Construction of the Designated Premises Endorsement 
We note a few general principles of law that will 
guide us in interpreting the policy at issue. 
First, “insurance 
policies are subject to the general rules of contract 
construction; the terms of the policy should be interpreted 
according to their plain, ordinary, and accepted sense in common 
speech unless it appears from the policy that a different 
meaning is intended.” Dairy Rd. Partners v. Island Ins. Co.,  92 
Hawaii 398, 411, 992 P.2d 93, 106 (2000) ( brackets and citation 
omitted). Thus, policy language “must be construed liberally in 
favor of the insured and [any] ambiguities [must be] resolved 
against the insurer.” 92 Hawai ‘i at 412, 992 P.2d at 107 
(alteration in original).  Second, pursuant to Hawai i Revised  
Statutes § 431:10  -237 (1993): “Every insurance contract shall 
be construed according to the entirety of its terms and 
conditions as set forth in the policy, and as amplified, extended, restricted, or modified by any rider, endorsement or 
application atta ched to and made a part of the policy.” 
Moreover, “[b] ecause an insurer’s duty to defend its insured is 
contractual in nature, we must look to the language of the  
policy involved to determine the scope of that duty. ”   
Sentinel,  
-13
-     
 
   
    
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWA II REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
76 Hawaiʻ i at 287, 875 P.2d at 904. “[W]henever the insurer 
relies on an exclusionary clause of a policy as a defense to 
liability, it has the burden of proving facts which bring the case within the exclusion.” 
Quinn v. Wilshire Ins. Co. , 53 Haw. 
19, 21, 486 P.2d 
59, 60 (1971).  In addition, any ambiguity in 
an exclusionary clause is construed in favor of the insured and 
“strictly construed against the insurer.” Retherford v. Kama,  
52 Haw. 91, 470 P.2d 517 (1970). 
The 
DPE, titled, “Limitation of Coverage to Designated 
Premises,” states: “This insurance applies only to ‘bodily injury’, ‘property damage’, or ‘personal and advertising injury’ 
arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the premises shown in the above Schedule.” The DPE lists “Locations 1 -3.” 
The parties are in agreement that “Locations 1 -3” includes C. 
Brewer’s corporate headquarters at 311 Pacific Street, but not 
the Dam site. 
James River and C. Brewer  present conflicting 
interpretations of the DPE.  James River argues that the DPE 
unambiguously limits coverage under the policy to liability for 
injury and damage on premises  listed in the Schedule,  and thus 
it has no obligation to defend or indemnify C. Brewer against 
the Pflueger lawsuit  because the Dam site is not listed.  C. 
Brewer argues that the DPE is ambiguous as to whether injury and  
damage “arising out of” the “use” of listed premises is covered, 
-14-     
 
   
  
  
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWA II REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
contending that the “arising out of” language in the DPE 
requires broad construction in its favor.  
We have held that “[a] contract is ambi
guous when its 
terms are reasonably susceptible to more than one meaning.” 
Hawaiian Ass’n of Seventh -Day Adventist v. Wong , 130 Hawai i 36, 
45, 305 P.3d 452, 461 (2013). We therefore begin by analyzing 
whether the positions advanced by the parties are reasonable 
interpretations of the policy’s language. 
James River cites to Union American Insurance Co. v. 
Haitian Refugee Center/Sant Refijie Ayisyin, Inc. , 858 So.2d 
1076 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2003), in support of its argument that 
the DPE must be construed to limit liability to designated premises. In Union American, a Haitian Refugee Center 
(“Center”) allegedly failed to provide adequate security at a street rally it sponsored located far from and unrelated to the 
Center’s headquarters, the designated pr emises, which led to the 
shooting of an individual at the rally by another individual in the crowd. 858 So.2d at 1077. The policy’s designated premises 
endorsement limited coverage to “bodily injury . . . arising out 
of [t]he ownership, maintenance or use of the premises shown in 
the [s]chedule and operations necessary or incidental to those 
premises[.]” 
Id. 
(first and second bracket in original; third 
bracket added) (quoting insurance policy at issue). The District Court of Appeal of Florida for the Third District 
-15-     
 
   
  
 
 
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWA II REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(“appeals court”) reversed the lower court’s holding that the 
policy provided coverage, concluding that the designated 
premises endorsement effectively converted the CGL policy  into a  
premises liability policy  despite the words “commercial lines 
policy” on the policy’s cover sheet . 858 So.2d at 1078 n.1, 
1079 (reversing judgment).  The appeals court explained that providing coverage on the ground that the event  was an operation 
necessary or incidental to the  Center’s  business  involved a 
judicial rewriting of the policy by substituting “
business”  for 
the policy word “premises.” 858 So.2d  at 1078. The appeals 
court stated: “This is a process in which we may not engage.” Id.  
Union American concerne
d a wrongful death action based 
on an alleged failure to provide adequate security, while this 
case involves damages for C. Brewer’s alleged negligent 
entrustment of the System to KIC and its alleged failure to disclose unsafe conditions, adequately capitalize KIC, or maintain the System. In addition, the injury in Union American  
occurred in a manner unrelated to the Center. 858 So.2d at 
1077. 
In this case, however, 
the injury and damage arguably 
relate to C. Br ewer’s “use” of its corporate headquarters to 
make negligent business decisions. Union American  is therefore

C. Brewer contends that the policy provides coverage 
for injury and 
damage arising out of i ts “use” of its corporate 
headquarters to make negligent corporate decisions even though 
the resulting damage happened at the unlisted Dam site. In 
support, C. Brewer relies on American Guarantee and Liability 
Insurance Co. v. 1906 Co.,
 129 F.3d 802 (5th Cir. 1997) 
(applying Mississippi state law), a case in which the court 
construed a designated premises endorsement with language 
similar to the James River DPE, to include coverage for injuries 
and damages occurring on a premises not listed in the 
endorsement. 
In American Guarantee,  an insurer sought a judgment 
that the CGL policy it sold to a Coca-Cola Bottling Company 
(“Coke Company”) afforded no coverage or defense for injuries 
arising out of a photography studio, wholly-owned and operated 
as a division of the Coke Company, in which the Coke Company 
chief executive officer’s (CEO) son, also an employee, surreptitiously videotaped female customers changing their 
clothes. 129 F.3d at 804. The designated premises endorsement 
at issue limited covera ge to “‘bodily injury,’ ‘property 
damage,’ ‘personal injury,’ ‘advertising injury’ and medical 
expenses arising out of . . . [t]he ownership, maintenance or 
use of the premises shown in the Schedule and operations 
necessary or incidental to those premises[.]” 129 F.3d at 8 06

(quoting insurance policy at issue).  The studio, located a mile 
away from the Coke Company, was not a designated premises. 
The Fifth Circuit held that the designated premises 
endorsement did not preclude coverage for negligence claims 
arising out of the use of the Coke Company headquarters, a 
designated premises, regarding supervisory actions over the 
studio and the CEO’s son. 129 F.3d at 808.  The Fifth Circuit 
concluded that the designated premises endorsement unambiguously 
covered injuries occurring at uncovered premises if a causal 
connection bet ween the injuries and “use” of a designated 
premises existed. See 129 F.3d at 807 (“[T]he phrase ‘arising 
out of’ the ‘use’ of the designated premises requires that there 
be a causal connection between the injuries . . . and the 
designated premises . . . .”). In construing a causal 
connection, the Fifth Circuit opined as follows: “The phrase 
‘arising out of’ is ordinarily understood to mean ‘originating from,’ ‘having its origin in,’ ‘growing out of,’ or ‘flowing from.’ In the insurance context, this phrase is often 
interpreted to require a causal connection between the injuries 
alleged and the objects made subject to the phrase.” Id. 
(internal citation omitted). 
The Fifth Circuit reasoned that the studio was owned 
and operated as a division of the Coke Company, the studio and 
Coke Company shared the same general checking account, employees

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWA II REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
of the studio were considered Coke Company employees, and all 
major business decisions concerning the studio, from the 
purchase of the equipment to the scope and ultimate termination 
of the business, were made at the Coke Company’s headquarters, a 
designated premises.  129 F.3d at 807-08.  The Fifth Circuit 
held that “[u]nder the circumstances, a factfinder could find a 
causal connection between [the Coke Company]  and [the CEO’s]  
supervisory activities, the operation of the designated 
premises, and the injuries that resulted from [the CEO’s son’s ]  
intentional and tortious actions at [the studio].” 129 F.3d at 808. 
Similarly, in this case, the System was owned and 
operated by KIC, a C. Brewer subsidiary, KIC’s employees were 
considered employees of C. Brewer, and all major business 
decisions concerning the System, including the allege  d failure 
to capitalize KIC, the entrance into various agreements to  
maintain the System, and the eventual sale of the land  
underlying the Reservoir, were apparently made at C. Brewer’s 
corporate headquarters. Therefore, a causal connection could 
possibly be found between C. Brewer and its entrustment of the 
System to KIC, the operation of the designated premises, and the 
injuries that resulted from C. Brewer’s  allegedly  negligent 
corporate decisions.

In addition, by relying on Union American,  James River 
seeks to rewrite the term “arising out of” to limit liability to 
injury and damage occurring on designated premises. 
Such a 
construction of the DPE would effectively convert the James 
River policy from a CGL policy to a premises liability policy 
that limits coverage to certain premises. James River’s 
argument contradicts the policy, which specifically states that 
it is a “commercial general liability” policy. In addition, 
such a construction contravenes general principles of insurance 
construction, which provide that policy language “must be 
construed liberally in favor of the insured and [any] ambiguities [must be] resolved against the insurer.”

In our view,  American Empire  Surplus Lines Insurance 
Co. v. Chabad House of North Dade, Inc.
, 771 F. Supp. 2d 1336 
(S.D.
 Fla. 2011), correctly analyzes the requirements for 
converting a CGL policy to a premises liability policy.  The 
policy at issue in Chabad House  is similar to the James River 
policy. Chabad House involved a “commercial general liability” 
policy that covered injury and  damage occurring anywhere in the

minimum, the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico,  and also

contained a similarly worded designated premises endorsement.8 
771 F. Supp. 2d at 1339, 1343. 
Citing to American Guarantee , in which the designated 
premises were 
specifically incorporated into the policy on the 
declarations page so as to put the insured on notice that 
coverage was limited to certain premises, the Chabad House court 
held that language in a DPE used to convert a CGL to a premises 
liability policy “must be clear and unequivocal.”  771 F. Supp. 
2d at 1343. We likewise hold that a DPE “must be clear and 
unequivocal[]” to convert a CGL policy to a premises liability 
policy in order to effectively limit coverage to injury or 
damage that occurs on undesignated premises.  Id. 
In this case, the James River DPE does not clearly 
convert the policy into 
a premises liability policy.  The DPE is 
similarly incorporated by reference into the policy on the declarations page; however, the declarations page does not list 
the designated premises.  Therefore, the DPE is not sufficiently clear and unequivocal to put the insured on notice and convert 
The designated premises endorsement in Chabad House  states:  
“This endorsement modifies insuranc e provided under the following: Commercial

The ownership, maintenance or use of the premises shown in the Schedule . . . 
and operations necessary or incidental to those pre mises.” Id.

construe the DPE as limiting coverage to injury and damage 
occurring on designated premises. , 92 
Hawai‘i at 412, 992 P.2d at 107 (holding that policy language 
“must be construed liberally in favor of the insured and [any] 
ambiguities [must be] resolved against the insurer.”). 
In further support of its position, C. Brewer contends 
that the inclusion of “personal and advertising injury” in the 
DPE “suggests that the parties may have intended to include coverage for negligent decisions made at a designated premises 
that resulted in injury and damages elsewhere .” (quoting C. 
Brewer
, mem. op. at 36). C. Brewer also notes that Chabad House  
found that the policy’s broad coverage territory , which included 
the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, and, under certain 
circumstances, other parts of the world, contradicted the 
designated premises endorsement. James River asserts that C. 
9 We note that although the parties are in agreement that the Dam 
site was not a listed premises, the DPE does not clearly define which 
premises correspond to “Locations 1 -3.” The declarations page contains a 
section titled, “Endorsements,” which refers the reader to a list of forms 
and endorsements in “attached schedule A.” “Schedule A” is essentially a 
table of contents, and includes the DPE. 
The DPE contains a section titled, “Schedule,” which reads 
“Premises: Locations 1 -3” with no reference directing the reader on where to 
find the list of locations. To find the “Schedule of Locations,” the reader 
must refer to a form titled, “Policy Changes,” also listed on “Schedule A.” 
The “Schedule of Locations” section contained on the “Policy Changes” page lists three premises, including 311 Pacific Street, but also lists a number 
of vacant parcels identified by TMK number.

Brewer’s interpretation is overly broad and renders the “arising 
out of” language meaningless. 
As the ICA reasoned, decisions made at C. Brewer’s 
corporate headquarte
rs would likely be the cause of any 
advertising injury;  however, the resulting injury would not 
occur on designated premises  .   In addition, the James River 
policy’s broad coverage territory  similarly encompasses the 
United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, and, under certain  
10  circumstances, other parts of the world.  Therefore , C. 
Brewer’s arguments further support its interpretation of the 
DPE. 
C. Classification Limitation Endorsement 
James River also argues  that its classification   
limitation endorsement  limits  coverage only to “t hose operations 
specified . . .  under the ‘description of operations’ or 
10 The James River policy defines “coverage territory” to mean: 
a. The United States of America (including its territories 
and possessions), Puerto Rico and Canada; 
b. International waters or airspace, but only if the injury 
or damage occurs in the course of travel or 
transportation between any places included in a. above; 
or 
c. All other parts of the world if the injury or damage 
arises out of: 
(1) Goods or products made or sold by you in the 
territory described in a. above; 
(2) The activities of a person whose home is in the 
territory described in a. above, but is away for a short time on your business; or 
(3) “Personal and advertising injury” offenses that 
take place through the Internet or similar 
electronic means of communication . . . .

‘classification’ on  the declarations of the policy.”   As C. 
Brewer emphasizes, the declarations page does not contain a 
“Description of Operations,” but rather, a “Description of 
Business” in which the phrase “Real Estate Owners” was inserted. 
James River maintains that C. Brewer was not the owner of any 
real estate at the time of the accident and therefore, the 
classification limitation endorsement affirms that the policy, 
read as a whole, was clearly intended to provide coverage only  
for C. Brewer’s liability as the owner of r eal estate 
specifically listed in the Schedule.  C. Brewer maintains that 
the classification limitation endorsement does not limit 
coverage to “land, owned or otherwise[,]” and that the phrase 
“Real Estate O wners” created ambiguity.  
The ICA concluded that 
the classification limitation 
endorsement did not resolve the ambiguity regarding coverage 
because the James River policy did not define “Real Estate 
Owners,” and the allegations in the Pflueger lawsuit “arguably implicated C. Brewer’s activities and operations as a real 
estate owner, such as [its alleged] failure[s] to warn about the 
unsafe condition of the Kaloko Dam and . . . to adequately 
capitalize its land operations and companies responsible for 
maintaining and repairing the Kaloko Dam.” 
C. Brewer,  mem. op. 
at 38.

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWA II REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Contrary to James River’s asse rtions, the 
classification limitation endorsement supports C. Brewer’s 
argument that the DPE does not precl  ude coverage for bodily 
injury and property damage on premises not listed  in the 
Schedule. The limitation specifically states:   “The coverage 
provided by this policy applies only to those operations   
specified in the applications(s) [sic] for insurance on files 
with the Company and described under the ‘description of 
operations’ or ‘classification on the declaration of the 
policy.’” (emphasis added) .   Thus, the policy specifically 
applies to “operations” specified in the application, and not the specified “premises .” Moreover, it appears that C. Brewer 
was leasing the 311 Pacific Street property. Therefore, 
according to James River’s argument regardin g the classification 
limitation endorsement, injury and damage that occur    on premises  
listed in the Schedule would be excluded from coverage because  
C. Brewer did not “own” the property listed. James River’s  
argument is illogical  and would require  this court to rewrite 
the terms of the  policy to ignore the premises specifically 
listed in the Schedule that C. Brewer did   not own, despite their  
clear inclusion in the policy.  
Accordingly, the classification limitation endorsement 
also supports C. Brewe r’s position that the policy was meant to 
cover injury and damage 
occurring on premises not listed in the

Schedule. Any ambiguities in this endorsement must also be 
construed against James River. See 92 Hawai ‘i at 4 12, 992 P.2d 
at 107. 
D. Additional Exclusions 
The circuit court granted James River’s motion for 
summary judgment based on the erroneous conclusion that the DPE 
excluded coverage for inj
ury and damage occurring on premises 
not listed in the DPE Schedule. Therefore, the circuit court did not analyze the James River policy in its entirety to 
determine whether any other exclusions or endorsements James 
River asserted in its motion for summary judgment applied to 
preclude coverage under the James River policy.
11 We decline to 
address for the first time on certiorari exclusions that the 
circuit court did not reach. 
V. Conclusion 
Adopting American Guarantee , we hold that the phrase 
“‘arising out of’ the ‘use’ of the designated premises requires 
that there be a causal connection between the injuries . . . and 
the designated premises[.]” 129 F.3d at 807.  We further hold 
that the DPE unambiguously provides coverage for  “bodily injury” 
11 James River included a number of exclusions in its motion for 
summary judgment that allegedly preclude coverage , including a “subsidence” 
exclusion, a provision limiting coverage to C. Brewer (and thus, precluding 
coverage for KIC), an irrigation and earth movement exclusion, and a provision excluding coverage for misrepresentation , fraud, and breach of the 
covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

and “property damage” that bears a causal connection to the 
“use” of designated premises, regardless of where the injury or 
damage occurs. Applying American Guarantee  to the facts of this 
case, we hold that the DPE 
unambiguously provides coverage for  
negligence claims arising out of the use of C. Brewer’s 
12  corporate headquarters.  Thus, the parties’ intent as to the 
DPE is not at issue.  
We therefore affirm in part and vacate in part the 
ICA’s October 22, 2013 judgment . We affirm that portion of the 
judgment 
to the extent that it vacated the circuit court’s 
December 21, 2007 Final Judgment.  We vacate in part that 
portion of the judgment to the extent that it instructed the 
12 Although the duty to defend was not raised on certiorari, it was 
raised in the circuit court and the ICA. We note that “the duty to defend 
‘rests primarily on the possibility that coverage exists.  This possibility 
may be remote, but if it exists[,] the [
insurer] owes the insured a 
defense.’ ”  Sentinel Ins. Co. v. First Ins. Co. of Hawai ʻi, 76 Hawaiʻ i 277, 
287, 875 P.2d 894, 904 (1994) (alteration in original) (citations omitted)
.  
Thus, the broader duty to defend rests on the possibility that the insured 
would be entitled to indemnification under the policy. See id.  (“In order to 
determine whether [the insurer] had a duty to defend . . . , we must examine 
whether the underlying action raised the possibility that the [insured] would 
be entitled to indemnification under any of the policies issued by [the 
insurer].”). “All doubts as to whether a duty to defend exists are resolved 
against the insurer and in favor of the insured[.]” Id. (alteration in 
original) (citation s omitted).
