OPINION OF THE COURT BY NAKAYAMA, J.
 
Petitioner/Plaintiff-Appellant Tara Thomas filed this
 
lawsuit against her former attorney, Respondent/Defendant-
Appellee Grant Kidani. 
Kidani represented Thomas in a real
 
estate dispute wherein Thomas sued Ricardo Barbati, a realtor
 involved in the purchase of her home, for misrepresentation of
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
the property. The case went to trial and the jury decided the
 
case against Thomas. Following that underlying trial, Thomas
 filed this lawsuit against Kidani alleging legal malpractice.
 Kidani filed, and the circuit court granted, his motion for
 summary judgment. The Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA)
 affirmed. Thomas v. Kidani, No. 29456, 2010 WL 3349523 (App.
 
Aug. 26, 2010) (SDO). Thomas filed a timely application for writ
 of certiorari.
 
We granted certiorari to clarify the standard of review
 
for an appeal from a motion for summary judgment and also to
 clarify the burdens of proof on parties to legal malpractice
 cases in the procedural context of a summary judgment motion. We
 hold that the ICA applied an incorrect standard of review on
 appeal. However, upon de novo review, we hold that Kidani is
 entitled to summary judgment in this case, though our analysis
 differs from that of the trial court and ICA. We therefore
 affirm the grant of summary judgment on different grounds. 
I. BACKGROUND
 
In 1989, Thomas purchased real property in Hilo, 
Hawai'i. According to Thomas, Barbati represented at the time of 
the sale that the property had a cesspool. The property does not have a cesspool, which Thomas contends she discovered 11 years after the sale, in 2000. Thomas filed a lawsuit in Circuit 
2
  
 
         
 
         
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
1
Court  alleging misrepresentation, unfair and deceptive trade
practices, negligence, and emotional distress. Kidani
 represented Thomas at trial against Barbati, and the jury
 delivered a verdict against Thomas, finding that she “knew or in
 the exercise of reasonable care should have discovered the
 location of the subject cesspool servicing her property on or
 before January 23, 1994.” 
This date reflected the application of
 
a six-year statute of limitations.
 
Following the conclusion of that underlying trial,
 
Thomas filed this lawsuit against Kidani for legal malpractice.2
 
In her complaint, Thomas alleged that Kidani committed
 malpractice when he did not argue that Barbati was Thomas’s agent
 in her purchase of the property. Thomas contends that this
 “fiduciary fraud” argument would have rebutted Barbati’s
 successful statute of limitations defense. Kidani filed a motion
 for summary judgment, arguing that he did present facts
 supporting an agency claim to the trial court, but alleging that
 “the trial court did not accept this interpretation of the
 facts.” Kidani also argued that the fiduciary fraud claim is not
 supported by case law and would not have been successful at
 
trial. The trial court agreed with Kidani and granted his motion

for summary judgment, explaining that Kidani “did attempt to
 
argue that the realtor was Plaintiff’s sole agent and/or
 fiduciary; however, the trial court did not accept this
 interpretation of the facts.” 
Thomas appealed to the ICA. On August 26, 2010, the
 
ICA filed a Summary Disposition Order (“SDO”) affirming the trial
 court’s November 3, 2008 judgment. Thomas v. Kidani, No. 29456,
 
2010 WL 3349523 (App. Aug. 26, 2010) (SDO). Therein the ICA held
 that the trial court properly granted defendant’s motion for
 summary judgment. Id. at *3. The ICA wrote, in part:
 
The circuit court did not err in granting Kidani’s MSJ,
Omerod v. Heirs of Kaheananui , 116 Hawai 'i 239, 254-55, 172
P.3d 983, 998-99 (2007), and the findings in the OrderGranting Kidani’s MSJ that Tara [Thomas] contests are notclearly erroneous. Bhakta v. County of Maui , 109 Hawai 'i 
198, 208, 124 P.3d 943, 953 (2005). 
Id. On September 16, 2010, the ICA filed its Judgment on Appeal.
 
On October 26, 2010, Thomas timely filed an application for writ
 
of certiorari, which this court granted on December 7, 2010. On
 April 28, 2011, this court granted a stay upon motion of
 petitioner’s counsel. The stay was lifted on June 30, 2011. 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
A. Motion for Summary Judgment
 
An appellate court reviews an award of summary judgment 
de novo under the same standard applied by the circuit court. Fujimoto v. Au, 95 Hawai' i 116, 136, 19 P.3d 699, 719 (2001) 
(citing Amfac, Inc. v. Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co., 74 Hawai' i 
4
       
      
         
           
          
        
             
           
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
85, 104, 839 P.2d 10, 22, reconsideration denied, 74 Hawai' i 650, 
843 P.2d 144 (1992)). This court articulated the standard as 
follows: 
Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there
is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
 Id. (citations omitted). We must review the evidence in the 
light most favorable to the party opposing the motion for summary judgment. Id. at 137, 19 P.3d 699 at 720 (citing State ex rel. 
Bronster v. Yoshina, 84 Hawai' i 179, 186, 932 P.2d 316, 323 
(1997) and Maguire v. Hilton Hotels Corp., 79 Hawai' i 110, 112, 
899 P.2d 393, 395 (1995)). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
A.	 The Standard of Review for Motions for Summary Judgment on
Appeal 
In her application for writ of certiorari, Thomas 
argues that the ICA erred because it applied the clearly 
erroneous standard of review, rather than the proper de novo standard.
3 In response, Kidani argues that the ICA did apply the 
de novo standard, and offers the ICA’s citation to Omerod v. Heirs of Kaheananui, 116 Hawai' i 239, 254-55, 172 P.3d 983, 998­
99 (2007), as proof. 
3
 Thomas raises three additional questions in her application.
 
These questions are no longer relevant to the case because our de novo review
affirms the grant of summary judgment on different grounds than the trial
court and ICA.

   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
The parties are correct that the proper standard for an 
appellate court reviewing a grant of summary judgment is de novo. 
Fujimoto v. Au, 95 Hawai' i 116, 136, 19 P.3d 699, 719 (2001) 
(citing Amfac, Inc. v. Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co., 74 Hawai' i 
85, 104, 839 P.2d 10, 22, reconsideration denied, 74 Hawai' i 650, 
843 P.2d 144 (1992)). While the ICA cited Omerod, it also held that “the findings in the Order Granting Kidani’s MSJ that Tara [Thomas] contests are not clearly erroneous.” Thomas v. Kidani, 
2010 WL 3349523, SDO at *3 (citing Bhakta v. County of Maui, 109 Hawai'i 198, 208, 124 P.3d 943, 953 (2005)). 
Bhakta is relevant to today’s case only for the 
articulation of the de novo standard. In that case, the petitioners challenged two of the trial court’s actions: the denial of summary judgment, and the court’s entry of an order supported by its findings of facts and conclusions of law. Bhakta v. County of Maui, 109 Hawai' i 198, 201, 124 P.3d 943, 
946. This court articulated the standard of review for motions
 
for summary judgment as de novo, but held that petitioners were
 not entitled to a review of the denial of summary judgment under
 the Morgan rule.
4 Id. at 207, 210-11, 124 P.3d at 952, 955-56. 
The clearly erroneous standard is irrelevant to this
 
4
 The Morgan rule, inapplicable here, states that a trial court’s 
denial of summary judgment due to the trial court’s finding of genuine issues
of material fact is not reviewable on post-trial appeal. Bhakta at 209, 124
P.3d at 954 (citing Larsen v. Pacesetter Systems, Inc. , 74 Hawai 'i 1, 837 P.2d 
1273 (1992)).

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
appeal. In Bhakta, the court utilized the standard only in 
reviewing the facts found by the trial court subsequent to its denial of summary judgment. Id. at 208, 124 P.3d at 953. This 
makes sense; the clearly erroneous standard of review exists because “on appeal we are to pay due deference to the trial court’s findings.” Daiichi Hawaii Real Estate Corp. v. Lichter, 
103 Hawai' i 325, 357, 82 P.3d 411, 443 (2003). This is 
particularly appropriate in reviewing a trial court’s assessment of witnesses or weighing of the evidence. Id. at 358, 82 P.3d at 
444 (citing Amfac v. Waikiki Beachcomber Inv., 74 Hawai' i 85, 
117, 839 P.2d 10, 28 (1992)) (further citations omitted). Appellate courts apply this deferential standard because, for those types of determinations, the trial court is “better positioned than an appellate court to marshall and weigh the pertinent facts. . . .” 808 Development, LLC v. Murakami, 111 
Hawai'i 349, 365, 141 P.3d 996, 1012 (2006). Contrast the review 
of the motion for summary judgment, in which the trial court applies the standard for a motion for summary judgment to the parties’ filings. (See section III.B.2, infra, for further discussion.) An appellate court need not apply the deferential clearly erroneous standard of review to the trial court’s grant of a motion for summary judgment because the appellate court is in as good of a position to assess the motion as the trial court.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
The ICA’s invocation of the clearly erroneous standard 
is inconsistent with Hawai' i law; the entirety of the trial 
court’s decision should have been reviewed de novo. We granted 
certiorari in part to clarify that standard. Having done so, we now perform a proper de novo review of defendant’s motion for summary judgment. 
B.	 De Novo Review Of The Motion For Summary Judgment
 
1.	 Legal Malpractice Standard And Burden Of Proof
 
The elements of an action for legal malpractice are:
 
(1) the parties had an attorney-client relationship, (2) the
 defendant committed a negligent act or omission constituting
 breach of that duty, (3) there is a causal connection between the
 breach and the plaintiff’s injury, and (4) the plaintiff suffered
 actual loss or damages. Coscia v. McKenna & Cuneo, 25 P.3d 670,
 
672 (Cal. 2001); 7 Am. Jur. 2d Attorneys at Law § 223 (2007). 
In this case, the fact that Thomas and Kidani formed an 
attorney-client relationship is undisputed. Because of this relationship, Kidani owed Thomas a duty “to use such skill, prudence, and diligence as lawyers of ordinary skill and capacity commonly possess and exercise in the performance of the tasks which they undertake.” Blair v. Ing, 95 Hawai' i 247, 259, 21 
P.3d 452, 464 (2001) (quoting Lucas v. Hamm, 364 P.2d 685, 689 (Cal. 1961)). Thomas contends that Kidani breached this duty 
8
         
         
         
         
           
         
        
     
          
         *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
when he “refused to even argue that this realtor [Barbati] was
 
Ms. Thomas’ agent in that case.” According to Thomas, this
 argument would have rebutted Barbati’s “key defense” that the
 statute of limitations had passed. Thomas further argues that
 proving Barbati was her agent:
 
would have precluded the jury from even considering whether
Ms. Thomas should have discovered that there was no cesspool
on the property, because such an issue would have been
irrelevant. Further, such a position would have shifted the
burden of proof to the realtor that everything he did was in
Ms. Thomas’ best interest. Thus, rather than Ms. Thomas
having to prove that the realtor was negligent, acted
intentionally, made misrepresentations, etc., the realtor
would have had the burden of proof to prove by a
preponderance that everything he did was in Ms. Thomas’ best
 interest.
 
The causation element of legal malpractice is often
 
thought of as requiring a plaintiff to litigate a “trial within a
 
trial.” 7 Am. Jur. 2d Attorneys at Law § 223 (2007). That is, a
 plaintiff must show “both the attorney’s negligence and also what
 the outcome of the mishandled litigation would have been if it
 had been properly tried.” Collins v. Greenstein, 61 Haw. 26, 38,
 
595 P.2d 275, 282 (1979). In this case, the burden falls on
 Thomas to prove that Kidani did not present this agency theory at
 trial, and that she would have prevailed at trial, had he
 presented the theory.
 
2. Summary Judgment Standard And Burden Of Proof
 This court has articulated the following rule for
 
motions for summary judgment:
 
9
       
      
         
           
          *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there
is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
 
Fujimoto v. Au, 95 Hawai' i 116, 136, 19 P.3d 699, 719 (2001) 
(citations omitted). “A fact is material if proof of that fact 
would have the effect of establishing or refuting one of the essential elements of a cause of action or defense asserted by the parties.” Id. We review the evidence in the light most 
favorable to the party opposing the motion for summary judgment. Id. at 137, 19 P.3d at 720 (citations omitted). 
The party moving for summary judgment bears the burden 
of proof to show the absence of genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. Stanford Carr 
Dev. Corp. v. Unity House Inc., 111 Hawai' i 286, 295-96, 141 P.3d 
459, 468-69 (2006). Where, as here, the moving party is the defendant and does not bear the burden of proof at trial, he may prevail on a motion for summary judgment by demonstrating that the plaintiff “fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.” Exotics Hawaii-Kona, Inc. v. E.I. Du Pont De Nemours & Co., 116 Hawai'i 277, 302, 172 P.3d 1021, 1046 (2007) (citing Hall v. 
State, 7 Haw. App. 274, 284, 756 P.2d 1048, 1055 (1988)) (emphasis omitted). 
10
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
The Supreme Court of the United States explained the
 
burden of proof in the context of a motion for summary judgment
 
in Celotex Corp. v. Catrett. In that case, Myrtle Nell Catrett,
 acting as administratrix of her deceased husband’s estate, filed
 a lawsuit against Celotex and other corporations arguing that her
 husband’s death was caused by exposure to products containing
 asbestos. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 319 (1986). 
Celotex moved for summary judgment, arguing that Catrett failed
 to prove Celotex’s liability, and the trial court granted the
 motion. Id. Catrett appealed, and the Court of Appeals reversed
 
the trial court, holding that Celotex’s motion for summary
 judgment was “fatally defective” because Celotex did not include
 any evidence to prove its lack of liability. Id. at 321. The
 
United States Supreme Court granted certiorari and reinstated the
 trial court’s order granting summary judgment, emphasizing that a
 motion for summary judgment does not shift the ultimate burden of
 proof from Catrett to Celotex. Id. at 322. Rather than
 
requiring Celotex to make an affirmative showing, Celotex is
 entitled to summary judgment if it shows that Catrett cannot
 establish all essential elements on which she bears the burden of
 proof at trial. Id. As the Court explained, “One of the
 
11
            
             
          
            
              
     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
5
principal purposes of the summary judgment rule  is to isolate
and dispose of factually unsupported claims or defenses, and we
 think it should be interpreted in a way that allows it to
 accomplish this purpose.” Id. at 323-24. 
As articulated within the context of this case, even
 
though Kidani is moving for summary judgment, the ultimate burden
 of proof in the case rests with Thomas. Summary judgment for
 Kidani is proper if Kidani shows that Thomas cannot meet her
 burden of proof. He may do so by showing either that he
 presented the agency theory at trial (thus defeating the breach
 element to Thomas’s legal malpractice claim), or by showing that
 Thomas cannot establish that she would have prevailed at trial,
 had Kidani presented the theory (thus defeating the causation
 element). 
3. Kidani Shows That Thomas Cannot Meet Her Burden Of
 
Proof That She Would Have Prevailed At Trial
 
As noted above, a plaintiff in a legal malpractice case
 
must litigate a trial within a trial; she must show that the
 outcome of the litigation would have been in her favor, had the
 attorney refrained from committing the alleged breach of duty. 
5
 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 56 has since been modified. 
However, the version in effect at the time of Celotex is in relevant aspects
substantively identical to the current Hawai 'i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 
56. We may look to federal cases interpreting their rule for persuasive
guidance. See Pulawa v. GTE Hawaiian Tel. , 112 Hawai 'i 3, 19 n.15, 143 P.3d 
1205, 1221 n.15 (2006) (citations omitted).

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
Collins v. Greenstein, 61 Haw. 26, 38, 595 P.2d 275, 282 (1979). 
Thus, Thomas must show that she would have prevailed at trial,
 had Kidani argued that Barbati was her agent. In his motion for
 summary judgment, Kidani argues that Thomas cannot meet her
 burden of proof, and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter
 of law. First, he argues that he did present the agency argument
 in the underlying trial but that the court in that case did not
 agree with this version of the facts. The trial court in the
 malpractice action agreed with this argument, and granted summary
 judgment on this ground. In performing our de novo review of the
 motion for summary judgment, we are persuaded that even if Kidani
 had argued Thomas’s legal theory, it would have been inadequate
 to change the outcome of the trial below. 
Thomas argues that under a “fiduciary fraud” theory of
 
liability, there is a burden shift, and instead of the plaintiff
 carrying the burden to show fraud, the defendant carries a burden
 to show that no fraud was committed. She also contends that the
 statute of limitations begins running upon actual knowledge of
 the misrepresentation, not when the plaintiff should have known
 of it. Kidani disputes both arguments. We hold that her
 argument regarding the statute of limitations is a misstatement
 of law, and that the application of the proper statute of
 limitations, combined with the jury’s findings from the
 
13
         
               
           
             
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
underlying trial, show that Thomas would not have prevailed at
 
trial, had Kidani presented her fiduciary fraud argument.
 
Thomas argues “in cases where the fraud-feasor stands
 
in a fiduciary relationship with plaintiff, courts, including
 those in Hawaii, generally require that the plaintiff have actual
 notice to begin the statute on the claim.” To support her
 argument, Thomas cites Poka v. Holi, 44 Haw. 464, 357 P.2d 100
 (1960); Adair v. Hustace, 64 Haw. 314, 640 P.2d 294 (1982); and
 Neel v. Magana, 491 P.2d 421 (Cal. 1971). As Kidani shows, these
 cases do not support Thomas’s argument.
 
The language Thomas cites from Poka v. Holi is
 
inapposite to today’s case. In that case, William Poka, a former
 administrator of an estate, sought specific performance on an
 oral contract for land transfer he claimed to have made with
 decedent, Alice Holi, before she died. Poka v. Holi, 44 Haw. at
 
465, 357 P.2d at 102. After serving as administrator for nearly
 twenty years, William was removed “for failure to file his
 accounts, among other reasons,” and Alice’s husband, Nani Holi,
 was appointed administrator de bonis non. Id. Nani asserted
 
6
laches  as a defense to William’s request for specific
6
 Black’s Law Dictionary defines “Laches” as “Unreasonable delay in
 
pursuing a right or claim — almost always an equitable one — in a way that
 
prejudices the party against whom relief is sought.” Black’s Law Dictionary
 953 (9th ed. 2009). This court has explained that the statute of limitations
applies to legal causes of action, while laches applies to actions requesting
continue...
 
14
          
       
        
          
             
            
             
          
            
             
         *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
performance on the land transfer. Id. at 466, 357 P.2d at 108. 
William argued that Nani could not assert laches against him
 
because William had been living in the subject real property for
 decades. Id. As this court explained, laches is a “lack of
 
diligence” and, in many cases, “may be negatived by possession
 which asserts the right under the contract sought to be
 enforced.” Id. at 478, 357 P.2d at 108. However, an exception
 
to this rule is when the person asserting possession to defeat
 laches is the administrator of the alleged grantor’s estate; in
 that case, possession is inadequate and the decedent’s heirs are
 entitled to actual knowledge or notice of William’s claim. Id.
 
at 480, 357 P.2d at 109. This holding is unrelated to, and not
 supportive of, Thomas’s argument.
 
Adair v. Hustace is similarly unsupportive. In fact,
 
the language Thomas cites from footnote seven is appended to one
 of the case’s holdings, a holding that directly contradicts her
 argument. As this court wrote, 
crossclaimants argue that where the basis of a claim is
fraud or breach of a confidential relationship, laches
should not operate until after a claimant has actual
knowledge of the claim, as opposed to knowledge of facts and
 
6...continue
 
equitable relief. Adair v. Hustace , 64 Haw. 314, 321, 640 P.2d 294, 300
(1982) (“(i)n actions at law, the question of diligence is determined by the
words of the statute ... (i)n suits in equity the question is determined by
the circumstances of each particular case.”) (quoting Patterson v. Hewitt , 195
U.S. 309, 317 (1904)). Thomas does not explain the applicability of the
equitable doctrine of laches to her legal action for fraud. We analyze her
 argument assuming, but not deciding, applicability.
 
15
        
       *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
circumstances sufficient to impute his knowledge of the
claim. This proposal is untenable. . . .
 
Adair v. Hustace, 64 Haw. 314, 322, 640 P.2d 294, 300 (1982). 
The court goes on to cite three cases rejecting the actual
 knowledge test, but focusing instead on the reasonableness of the
 tardy party’s delay. Id. at 322-23, 640 P.2d at 301 (citing In
 
re Kealiiahonui, 9 Haw. 1 (1893) (a party may assert fraud after
 a lapse of time if he was not at fault for the delay); In re
 Nelson, 26 Haw. 809 (1923) (permitting transfer of title twenty-
four years after eligibility where donee had neither actual nor
 constructive notice of the eligibility); Brown v. Bishop Trust
 Co., 44 Haw. 385, 355 P.2d 179 (1960) (permitting summary
 judgment against plaintiff even though plaintiff did not have
 actual knowledge of trustee’s liability because plaintiff had
 enough facts to reasonably provoke inquiry)).
 
Thomas offers a third case, Neel v. Magana, 491 P.2d
 
421 (Cal. 1971), arguing that the fiduciary relationship makes it
 unreasonable to require actual notice of wrongdoing. This case
 is unsupportive of Thomas’s asserted requirement of actual
 knowledge; the holding of that case is that constructive
 knowledge suffices to start the statute of limitations. As the
 Supreme Court of California explained, “We therefore hold that in
 an action for professional malpractice against an attorney, the

should know, all material facts essential to show the elements of
 
that cause of action.” 491 P.2d at 433 (emphasis added).
 
Under Hawaii’s discovery rule, the statute of 
limitations begins to run when the plaintiff “discovers or should have discovered the negligent act, the damage, and the causal connection between the former and the latter.” Yamaguchi v. 
Queen’s Medical Center, 65 Haw. 84, 90, 648 P.2d 689, 693-94 (1982). Our courts have employed this rule in several contexts. Ass’n of Apartment Owners of Newton Meadows v. Venture 15, Inc., 115 Hawai' i 232, 167 P.3d 225 (2007) (defective construction); 
Blair v. Ing, 95 Hawai' i 247, 21 P.3d 452 (2001) (legal 
malpractice); Russell v. Attco, Inc., 82 Hawai' i 461, 923 P.2d 
403 (1996) (premises liability); Yamaguchi v. Queen’s Medical Center, 65 Haw. 84, 648 P.2d 689 (1982) (medical malpractice). The cases Thomas cites do not prove that cases involving fraud disregard this rule. 
Kidani also shows that Thomas’s expert declaration from 
Steven D. Strauss, an attorney licensed to practice in Hawai' i, 
likewise does not satisfy Thomas’s burden of proof. Strauss opined that Kidani had a duty to attempt to plead and prove a cause of action for fiduciary fraud. He also opined that pleading this cause of action would have shifted the burden for the trial from Thomas to Kidani. Kidani contends that Strauss’s

declaration does not meet the requirements of Exotics Hawaii-
Kona, Inc. v. E.I. Du Pont De Nemours & Co., 116 Hawai' i 277, 172 
P.3d 1021 (2007), because it is based on conjecture and speculation, and because it contains improper legal conclusions. We agree. 
In Exotics Hawaii-Kona, Inc. v. E.I. Du Pont De Nemours 
& Co., the trial court awarded summary judgment to defendant Du Pont in a case brought by commercial growers alleging fraud, misrepresentation, non-disclosure, and other claims following a settlement agreement. 116 Hawai' i 277, 283-84, 172 P.3d 1021, 
1027-28 (2007). We upheld summary judgment in favor of Du Pont on the grounds that plaintiffs were unable to prove damages. Id. 
at 283, 172 P.3d at 1027. Plaintiffs had offered proof in the form of affidavits from attorney expert witnesses, but we held that the affidavits did not demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact to defeat summary judgment. Id. at 305, 172 P.3d 
at 1049. The affidavits simply stated the experts’ conclusions on the ultimate legal issues, but did not include the factors considered or the analysis followed by the experts. Id. Because 
of this omission, this court upheld summary judgment, explaining that “[t]he unsubstantiated conclusions of the plaintiffs’ experts are insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact that would preclude summary judgment.” Id.; see also Acoba

v. Gen. Tire, Inc., 92 Hawai' i 1, 14, 986 P.2d 288, 301 (1999), 
(“Although expert testimony may be more inferential than that of 
fact witnesses, in order to defeat a motion for summary judgment[,] an expert opinion must be more than a conclusory assertion about ultimate legal issues.”) (quoting Ferguson v. District of Columbia, 629 A.2d 15, 20 (D.C. App. 1993)). 
The Strauss declaration is similar to the affidavits 
this court considered in Exotics Hawaii-Kona because it provides conclusions on essential elements of Thomas’s legal malpractice claims without demonstrating the connection between the circumstances of the case and his opinion. The declaration does not cite any legal authority, either from Hawai' i or other 
jurisdictions, to support his conclusions that Thomas’s fiduciary fraud argument applies in the context of this case and would have affected outcome of the trial, had Kidani presented it. The declaration also presents no cogent rationale as to why the fiduciary fraud argument should apply in this context. Accordingly, the declaration does not help meet Thomas’s burden to prove that she would have prevailed below, had Kidani argued her agency theory. 
We agree with Kidani that Thomas does not satisfy her
 
burden of proof to show that she would have prevailed at trial
 because her argument relies on the faulty premise that actual

notice is required to trigger the statute of limitations. The 
discovery rule states that the statute of limitations begins running when the plaintiff knew or should have known of the damage. Accordingly, Barbati’s “key defense” that the statute of limitations had run on her claims would have also defeated this agency claim, had Kidani made it. “When there has been a belated discovery of the cause of action, the issue whether the plaintiff exercised reasonable diligence is a question of fact for the court or jury to decide.” Vidinha v. Miyaki, 112 Hawai' i 336, 
342, 145 P.3d 879, 885 (App. 2006). In Thomas’s trial against Kidani, the jury found “that Defendants have proven by a preponderance of the evidence that Plaintiff knew or in the exercise of reasonable care should have discovered the location of the subject cesspool servicing her property on or before January 23, 1994.” That date, January 23, 1994, reflects the application of a six-year statute of limitations.
7 Accordingly, 
even assuming that Thomas satisfies her burden of proving that Kidani did not argue her agency theory below, and further assuming that he would have been able to establish that Barbati

 There is no explicit statute of limitations for claims of real
 
estate fraud. We need not determine exactly which general statute of
limitations should apply because six years is the longest statute of
limitations potentially applicable to the case. See Higa v. Mirikitani , 55
Haw. 167, 517 P.2d 1 (1973) (holding that the six-year statute of limitations
for claims sounding in contract applied to legal malpractice, rather than the
two-year statute of limitations for claims sounding in tort).

was Thomas’s agent, Kidani shows that Thomas cannot meet her
 
burden to prove that she would have successfully overcome the
 statute of limitations.
 
In summary, even though Kidani moved for summary
 
judgment, Thomas retains the burden of proving that she would
 have prevailed at trial had Kidani presented the fiduciary fraud
 theory. As the movant for summary judgment, Kidani may prevail
 if he shows that Thomas cannot meet her burden. The court holds
 that Thomas did not carry her burden to prove that she would have
 prevailed on her “fiduciary fraud” theory in trial. Kidani’s
 defense against Thomas’s unsupported claim is successful; there
 are no material facts in dispute that would affect our analysis
 of this element, and Kidani has shown that he is entitled to
 summary judgment as a matter of law. The ICA’s judgment
 affirming the trial court’s grant of summary judgment is thus
 affirmed, on the grounds articulated above.
