OPINION OF THE COURT BY DUFFY, J.
 
Petitioners/Plaintiffs-Appellants Charles Mitchell Hart

the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ (“ICA”) July 21, 2011 summary
 
disposition order and September 21, 2011 judgment on appeal,
 which affirmed the judgment of the district court of the first
 circuit (“district court”) entered on December 4, 2008
 
1
(“judgment”)  in favor of Respondent/Defendant-Appellee TICOR
Title Insurance Company (“TICOR”) on the Harts’ claim for breach
 of contract. The district court’s judgment also specified that
 the Harts’ motion for partial summary judgment filed on October
 21, 2008 was denied, and awarded TICOR attorneys’ fees of
 $
5,000.00 and costs of $281.49. 
We accepted the Harts’ Application, which presents the
 
following questions:
 
A.	 Whether the ICA gravely erred in concluding that TICOR had
no duty to defend the Harts against the State’s claim to any
interest in the Harts’ property that may have escheated
to the State where the ICA determined there was no duty to
defend only by relying on procedural defects in the State’s
claim and the State’s subsequent abandonment of the claim.
 
B.	 Whether the ICA gravely erred in upholding the award of
attorneys’ fees and costs to TICOR.
 
Based on the analysis below, we vacate the ICA’s judgment and
 
reverse the judgment of the district court in favor of TICOR. We
 also vacate the district court’s award of attorneys’ fees and
 costs to TICOR. We remand the case to the district court with
 instructions (1) to enter judgment in favor of the Harts, and (2)

to determine an award of attorneys’ fees and costs to the Harts,
 
with the specific instruction that the Harts’ award be limited to
 the period of time from the Harts’ tender of defense to TICOR
 until the escheat claim reached resolution through written court
 order. 
I. BACKGROUND
 
A.	 The Harts’ Title Insurance Policy
 
This appeal arises from TICOR’s refusal to defend the 
Harts under their title insurance policy against an escheat
2 
claim asserted by the State of Hawai' i. The Harts purchased a 
title insurance policy from TICOR for their property comprised of two lots in Ewa Beach (“Policy”); TICOR issued the Policy on July 13, 2005.
3 The Policy provides, in relevant part: 
Subject to the exclusions from coverage, the exceptions from
coverage contained in Schedule B and the conditions and
stipulations, TICOR Title Insurance Company, a California
corporation, herein called the Company, insures, as of Date of
Policy shown in Schedule A, against loss or damage, not exceeding
the amount of insurance stated in Schedule A, sustained or
incurred by the insured by reason of:
 
1.	 Title to the estate or interest described in Schedule A
 
being vested other than as stated therein;
 
2
 Black’s Law Dictionary 623 (9th ed. 2009) defines “escheat” as:
 
“(1) Hist. The reversion of land ownership back to the lord when
the immediate tenant dies without heirs. . . . (2) Reversion of
property (esp. real property) to the state upon the death of an
owner who had neither a will nor any legal heirs. . . . (3)
Property that has so reverted.”

2.	 Any defect in or lien or encumbrance on the title;
 
3.	 Unmarketability of the title;
 
4.	 Lack of a right of access to and from the land.
 
The Company will also pay the costs, attorneys’ fees and expenses
incurred in defense of the title, as insured, but only to the
extent provided in the Conditions and Stipulations.
 
(Emphasis added). Additionally, the Policy includes the
 
following “Conditions and Stipulations,” in relevant part:
 
4.	 Defense and Prosecution of Actions: Duty of Insured
 
Claimant to Cooperate
 
(a) Upon written request by the insured and subject to the
options contained in Section 6 of these Conditions and
Stipulations [entitled “Options to Pay or Otherwise Settle
 Claims: Termination of Liability”], the Company, at its own
cost and without unreasonable delay, shall provide for the
defense of an insured in litigation in which any third party
asserts a claim adverse to the title or interest as insured,
but only as to those stated causes of action alleging a
defect, lien or encumbrance or other matter insured against
by this policy. The Company shall have the right to select
counsel of its choice (subject to the right of the insured
to object for reasonable cause) to represent the insured as
to those stated causes of action and shall not be liable for
 and will not pay the fees of any other counsel. The Company
will not pay any fees, costs or expenses incurred by the
insured in the defense of those causes of action which
 allege matters not insured against by this policy.
 
The Policy contains the following “Exclusions from Coverage,” in
 
relevant part:
 
9.	 Claims arising out of customary and traditional rights and
practices, including without limitation those exercised for
subsistence, cultural, religious, access or gathering
purposes, as provided for in the Hawaii Constitution or the
Hawaii Revised Statutes.
 
10.	 Rights  or  claims  of  persons  or  entities  other  than  the
insured  involving  or  arising  out  of:   mineral  or  metallic
  
mines;  geothermal  resources;  water;  fishing,  commerce  or
 
navigation;  creation  or  loss  of  the  land  or  any  portion
  
thereof  by  accretion,  avulsion,  erosion  or  artificial  means;
persons  residing  on  or  otherwise  in  possession  of  the  land
 
or  any  portion  thereof;  trails,  roadways  or  other  rights  of

       *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
way, including without limitation any such rights or claims
under Chapter 264, Hawaii Revised Statutes.
 
Additionally, Schedule B to the Policy provides, in relevant
 
part:
 
All matters set forth in the paragraphs below the caption
“Exclusions from Coverage” on the inside cover of this Policy and
the following matters are expressly excluded from the coverage of
this Policy and [TICOR] will not pay loss or damage, costs,
attorney’s [sic] fees or expenses which arise by reason thereof.
 
. . .
 
2.	 Location of the seaward boundary in accordance with the laws
of the State of Hawaii and shoreline setback line in
 accordance with County regulation and/or ordinance and the
effect, if any, upon the area of the land described herein.
 
B.	 The Harts’ Land Court Proceeding
 
On August 2, 2005, the Harts filed a Land Court
 
petition to consolidate their two lots into one parcel.4 In
 
response to the Harts’ proceeding, the State of Hawai' i (“State”) 
filed an answer to the Harts’ petition for consolidation
 
(“Answer”) on October 24, 2005. The State’s answer asserted
 present interests in the Harts’ property, in relevant part:
 
THIRD DEFENSE:
 
. . . [the] State denies any allegations adverse to its interest
in or affecting [the Harts’ property], which are as follows:
 
1.	 The State owns the submerged land up to the upper reaches of
the wash of the waves, including the erosion areas.
 
2.	 The State owns all mineral and metallic mines of every kind
or description on the property, including geothermal rights,
and the right to remove the same.

 Land Court Case No. 05-0015, Application No. 242.
 
5
    
          
          
          
          
       
         
     
          
         
        
  
          
     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
3.	 The State reserves the rights of native tenants in the
property.
 
4.	 The State reserves all right, title, interest[] or claim to
waters having their source upon or flowing over or under the
property.
 
5.	 The State reserves an easement for the free flowage of
waters through, over, under[] and across the property.
 
6.	 The State reserves any interests in the property that
may have escheated to the State.
 
7.	 The State reserves any other interests in the property that
may be revealed during the course of this Petition
proceeding.
 
(Emphasis added). The State then requested the following
 
affirmative relief from the Land Court regarding its escheat
 claim:
 
Wherefore, [the] State prays that the Court rules that:
 
. . .
 6.	 The State has reserved any interests in the property that
may have escheated to the State[.]
 
Later, on October 30, 2006, the State again asserted these same
 
claims in its answer to the Harts’ amended petition for
 consolidation (“Answer to Amended Petition”). Ultimately,
 through its answer and answer to amended petition, the State
 twice asserted its present interest in the Harts’ property by way
 of escheat and twice asked the Land Court for affirmative relief.
 
The Harts tendered their defense against all the
 
State’s claims to TICOR on November 7, 2005. TICOR refused the
 Harts’ tender on January 4, 2006. TICOR’s January 4, 2006
 
6
    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
response collectively categorized the State’s claims,
 
reservations and defenses as the “State’s Claims.” TICOR
 explained that because the Harts did not specify which of the
 “State’s Claims” they were tendering to TICOR, TICOR assumed that
 the tender was “for the defense of the State’s water and mineral
 rights, native tenants’ rights, erosion and shoreline setback
 claims.” Based on the Policy’s Exclusions for Coverage and
 Schedule B, TICOR concluded that defense of these specific claims
 was excluded under the Policy.
 
The Harts replied on January 9, 2006, contending that
 
TICOR “cited no policy exclusion for [the escheat] claim, and the
 [P]olicy insures that the State owns no interest in the insured
 property by way of escheat. Thus, [TICOR] is obliged to defend
 against that claim.” TICOR disagreed. Significantly, however,
 in a March 9, 2006 letter to the Harts, TICOR conceded that a
 claim of escheat is not excluded from coverage, but contended
 that “[w]hile escheat to the state is not a matter which is
 excluded from coverage, it does not appear that the [S]tate is
 currently making any claim of escheat.” Rather, the State “has
 merely reserved its right to make that claim at some point in the
 future.” Accordingly, in TICOR’s view, the State did not assert
 any “claim” that fell within the Harts’ Policy coverage.

     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Consequently, the Harts proceeded to defend against all
 
of the State’s claims in Land Court. The Harts filed a motion
 
for summary judgment to resolve all encumbrances on title claimed
 by the State (“Motion for Summary Judgment Re: Encumbrances”) on
 June 6, 2007. On June 22, 2007, the State filed a memorandum in
 opposition to the Harts’ motion for summary judgment re:
 encumbrances, stating “[t]he State is not pursuing any claim of
 escheat to the State.” The Land Court heard the motion on July
 2, 2007.
5 On December 5, 2007, the Land Court granted in part
 
and denied in part the Harts’ motion: 
[the Harts’] Motion is granted as the court has determined that
there is no basis for the State’s claims for the rights of native
tenants, mineral and metallic mines[] and escheat , and is denied
as to the State’s claims for submerged lands up to the shoreline,
underground water and surface streams[] and an easement for the
free flowage of water. However, the State is not foreclosed in
the future from asserting claims for the rights of native tenants
or mineral and metallic mines if they actually manifest in the
future.
 
(Emphasis added). On February 1, 2008, the Land Court ordered
 
the consolidation of the Harts’ lots.
 
On March 28, 2008, the Harts requested reimbursement
 
from TICOR for the legal fees associated with its defense of the
 State’s claims against their property. The Harts contended that
 the State asserted an escheat claim covered under the Policy, and
 though it was a “false claim[,] . . . defense against the escheat

claim was inseparably part of the defense of all claims, and
 
[TICOR] was obligated to see the defense through to conclusion by
 court ruling.” Accordingly, the Harts demanded reimbursement for
 their attorneys’ fees and costs in the amount of $28,982.43 and
 notified TICOR that if it failed to respond by April 18, 2008,
 the Harts would file suit. TICOR responded with a letter
 affirming denial of the Harts’ defense claim on May 2, 2008.
 C. The Harts’ District Court Proceeding
 
The Harts filed the instant suit against TICOR in
 
district court for breach of contract under the Policy and bad
 faith on May 6, 2008.
6 On June 12, 2008, the district court
 
entered a default judgment against TICOR and awarded the Harts
 $21,485.59.
7 TICOR responded with a motion to set aside entry of
 
default and default judgment on June 20, 2008.8 The district

 TICOR claims that, according to the Harts’ attorneys’ invoices,
 
the Harts’ counsel reviewed TICOR’s May 2, 2008 letter affirming the denial of
 
the Harts’ defense claim on May 7, 2008 ( i.e., one day after the Complaint was
filed in district court).

 The Honorable Hilary B. Gangnes presided.

 TICOR asserted in its Motion to Set Aside Entry of Default and
 
Default Judgment:
 
Despite receiving the May 2, 2008 letter, [the Harts] elected not
to notify either Title Guaranty in Honolulu or [sic] TICOR’s
counsel in California that they had filed the Complaint. Instead,
 [the Harts] served the Complaint upon “The Corporation Company,”
TICOR’s agent registered with the Division of Insurance,
Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs.
 
The return date in this action was set for May 19, 2008, a mere 12

         *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
court granted TICOR’s motion on July 9, 2008. 
The Harts filed a motion for partial summary judgment
 
on October 21, 2008. The Harts’ motion asserted:
 
[d]espite conceding that escheat stated a covered claim, TICOR
refused to defend the Harts. TICOR did not investigate the
 State’s claim. Instead, to avoid its defense obligation, TICOR on
its own simply recharacterized the State’s claim from “[t]he State
reserves any interest in the property that may have escheated to
the State” to “[t]he State has merely reserved its right to make
that claim at some point in the future .” Relying on its contrived
distinction between the reservation of an interest that arose in
 the past and the reservation of the right to make a claim at some
point in the future, TICOR denied coverage.
 
Ultimately, the Harts contended that the State’s assertion of a
 
claim for escheat in its answer and answer to amended petition
 raised the potential for coverage under the Policy. Accordingly,
 Hawai'i law mandates that because a mere potential for coverage 
existed under the Policy, “TICOR had a duty to defend the Harts
 until that potential was resolved.”
 
In response, TICOR filed a memorandum in opposition to
 
the Harts’ motion for partial summary judgment on October 29,

days  a fter  the  date  of  service.   The  Corporation  Company  mailed
the  Complaint  to  TICOR’s  mainland  office  in  California.   Before
 
TICOR  could  review  the  Complaint  and  have  opportunity  [sic]  to
retain  Hawaii  counsel,  however,  .  .  .  default  was  entered  against
TICOR.
 
Th

[sic] as to the merits of [the Harts’] case. Thus, TICOR
respectfully requests this Court to allow its defenses to be
heard.

    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
2008.9 TICOR argued that the State failed “to allege a present
 
claim to an interest insured by TICOR[]” and, therefore, TICOR
 
was not obligated to tender the Harts a defense. TICOR explained
 that the Harts voluntarily filed their lot consolidation action
 in Land Court and this voluntary action prompted the State’s
 reservation.
10 “The State did not file a counterclaim against
 
[the Harts]. The State’s [a]nswer did not attack [the Harts’]
 title.” Instead, the State’s escheat reservation was but one of
 many “standard reservations -- the same reservations that the
 State asserts in every Land Court case.”
 
TICOR also asserted that the Harts’ “counsel knew that
 
the State did not claim to own a present interest by way of
 escheat.” Nevertheless, the Harts “tendered the prosecution of
 their voluntary Petition to TICOR.” TICOR pointed out that the
 
9
 TICOR also filed its own motion for summary judgment on November
 
6, 2008. TICOR submitted a proposed order to the district court to deny the
 
Harts’ motion for summary judgment via letter to the presiding judge, the
Honorable Christopher P. McKenzie. TICOR’s letter to Judge McKenzie stated:
 
. . . in an effort to conserve judicial resources, the parties
agree that the Proposed Order shall also include language entering
summary judgment against the [Harts] and in favor if TICOR on the
[Harts’] claims for breach of contract, breach of implied covenant
of good faith and fair dealing and bad faith.
 
TICOR has filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. . . . In the event
 
that the Court files the Proposed Order, TICOR’s Motion will be
withdrawn . . . .
 
10
 The Harts responded during the motion for summary judgment hearing
 
on November 3, 2008, that while the State’s escheat claim “arose in the
 context of the Harts’ [lot consolidation] petition, . . . it was nonetheless
an affirmative attack on title.”
 
11
    
     
        *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Harts’ counsel’s invoices for attorneys’ fees “do not indicate
 
that any time was spent on the issue of escheat.” 
The district court heard the motions on November 3,
 
2008.11 The district court agreed with TICOR and denied the
 
Harts’ summary judgment motion from the bench. On November 13,
 2008, the district court entered “summary judgment against the
 Harts and in favor of TICOR on the Harts’ claim for breach of
 contract for failing to defend them.”
12 The district court found
 
“that the [S]tate’s escheat defense was a routine reservation of
 a possible defense and did not trigger coverage” and that “the
 language raising the escheat defense did not create a realistic
 or reasonable potential for coverage” under the Policy. The
 district court also awarded TICOR attorneys’ fees and costs in
 the amount of $5,281.49.
 
The Harts appealed. The ICA affirmed the district
 
court’s judgment, noting “[t]he State’s reservation of possible
 rights did not amount to a claim of an escheated interest[]” in
 part because the State did not follow the statutory requirements
 for making an escheat claim. Hart v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., No.
 
29467, 2011 WL 2938210, at *1 (Haw. App. July 21, 2011).

 Accordingly, TICOR withdrew its own motion for summary judgment.

Specifically, “a claim of escheat may be raised only in
 
accordance with Hawaii Revised Statutes § 665-1 (1993)[,]”13
 
which requires the State to file an action in the first circuit
 court setting forth the factual basis for escheat in order to
 assert such a claim. Id. According to the ICA, the State failed
 
to assert any facts supporting a claim of escheat and made no
 demand for an escheated interest in its answer. Id. 
Additionally, in a footnote, the ICA explained that “[l]ater in
 the consolidation proceeding, the State expressly clarified that
 it had no escheat claim.” Id. at *1 n.2. As such, “the
 
[d]istrict [c]ourt did not err in concluding that [TICOR] had no
 duty to defend the Harts under the subject title insurance
 policy.” Id. at *1. Furthermore, “[g]iven [the ICA’s]
 
disposition of the Harts’ underlying claim, there is no basis for
 disturbing the award [of attorneys’ fees].” Id. 
The Harts filed a timely Application on December 20,
 
13
 HRS § 665-1 (1993) provides:
 
In all cases where real property escheats by law to the State, the
attorney general shall file an information in the circuit court of
the first circuit, setting forth the facts upon which the claim of
the State to the escheat is based. Summons shall be issued as in
 other actions. The attorney general shall cause the summons to be
served upon any person in possession of the property, and shall
also cause a copy thereof to be published once a month for three
months in a newspaper of general circulation in the State. Upon
the hearing of the matter, if the court finds the facts averred in
the information substantiated by proof and sufficient in law, it
shall make and cause to be entered a decree declaring the property
an escheat to the State.

2011. United Policyholders submitted a motion for leave to file
 
an amicus brief in support of the Harts’ Application also on
 December 20, 2011. On December 23, 2011, TICOR filed an
 opposition to United Policyholder’s motion. This court granted
 United Policyholders’ motion on December 29, 2011 and United
 Policyholders filed its amicus brief on January 4, 2012. TICOR
 submitted a response to the Harts’ Application on January 4,
 2012. On January 9, 2012, TICOR filed a response to United
 Policyholders’ amicus brief. We accepted the Harts’ Application
 on January 24, 2012 and held oral argument on February 22, 2012.
 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
A. Summary Judgment
 
This court reviews a lower court’s summary judgment 
decision de novo under the same standard employed by the lower court. Dairy Road Partners v. Island Ins. Co., Ltd., 92 Hawai' i 
398, 411, 992 P.2d 93, 106 (2000). Summary judgment is appropriate “if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories[] and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP)

III. DISCUSSION
 
We hold that the ICA erred in concluding that TICOR did
 
not have a duty to defend the Harts against the State’s escheat
 claim in the specific, unique circumstances of this case, and in
 affirming the district court’s judgment and award of attorneys’
 fees and costs in favor of TICOR.
14
 
A.	 The ICA erred in concluding that TICOR had no duty to defend
the Harts against the State’s escheat claim.
 
Hawai'i insurance law regarding the insurer’s duty to 
defend is well established. Under our precedent, TICOR had a
 
duty to defend the Harts against the State’s escheat claim under
 the Policy.
 
14
 As noted earlier herein, the district court employed an unusual
 
procedure in reaching its judgment. The Harts filed their motion for summary
 
judgment on October 21, 2008. TICOR filed an opposition on October 29, 2008.
The district court heard the motion and opposition on November 3, 2008, and
ruled in favor of TICOR from the bench. TICOR filed its own motion for
 summary judgment on November 6, 2008. On November 10, 2008, TICOR submitted a
proposed order to Judge McKenzie via letter. On November 13, 2008, the
district court signed the proposed order, entering “summary judgment against
 the Harts and in favor of TICOR.” Also on November 13, 2008, TICOR withdrew
 its motion for summary judgment.
Because both parties presented summary judgment motions to the
district court and because TICOR ultimately succeeded, this court will view
the evidence in the light most favorable to the Harts. As explained below in
Section III.A.2., TICOR bore the burden of proving that there was no genuine
issue of material fact with respect to whether a possibility existed that the
Harts would incur an encumbrance on their insured land.
 
16
    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
1.	 Ambiguities in the insurance contract must be resolved
in favor of the insured.
 
An insurer’s duty to defend stems from the policy 
contract and, thus, the language of the policy involved 
determines the scope of that duty. Sentinel Ins. Co., Ltd. v. 
First Ins. Co. of Haw., Ltd., 76 Hawai' i 277, 287, 875 P.2d 894, 
904 (1994). When interpreting insurance contracts, this court has acknowledged that “insurers have the same rights as individuals to limit their liability and to impose whatever conditions they please on their obligation, provided they are not in contravention of statutory inhibitions or public policy.” Dairy Road, 92 Hawai' i at 411, 992 P.2d at 106 (quoting First 
Ins. Co. of Haw., Inc. v. State, 66 Haw. 413, 423, 665 P.2d 648, 655 (1983)) (brackets omitted). Furthermore, TICOR correctly points out that “[a] court must respect the plain terms of the policy and not create ambiguity where none exists.” Allstate, 
118 Hawai' i at 182, 186 P.3d at 617 (internal quotation marks 
omitted) (quoting Smith v. New England Mut. Life Ins. Co., 72 Haw. 531, 537, 827 P.2d 635, 638 (1992)). 
However, “because insurance policies are contracts of
 
adhesion and are premised on standard forms prepared by the
 insurer’s attorneys, we have long subscribed to the principle
 that they must be construed liberally in favor of the insured and
 
17
    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
any ambiguities must be resolved against the insurer.” Dairy 
Road, 92 Hawai' i at 411-12, 992 P.2d at 106-07 (brackets and 
citations omitted). Courts are to construe insurance policies in 
“accord with the reasonable expectations of a layperson.” Id. at 
412, 992 P.2d at 107 (citations omitted). Ultimately, “[a]ll doubts as to whether a duty to defend exists are resolved against the insurer and in favor of the insured[.]” Id. (quoting 
Sentinel, 76 Hawai' i at 287, 875 P.2d at 904). 
In the instant case, the parties dispute whether the
 
State’s escheat reservation contained in its answer and answer to
 amended petition qualifies as an “escheat claim” that triggered
 coverage under the Harts’ Policy. The Harts maintain that the
 State’s answer “asserted interest in and claims against” the
 Harts’ property. On the other hand, TICOR argues, and the ICA
 agreed, that the State was not making an escheat “claim” in its
 Answer, but was “merely” indicating “that it was not waiving, by
 its response, any claims based on escheat.” Hart, 2011 WL
 
2938210, at *1. Accordingly, TICOR contends that the term
 “claim” is unambiguous. We agree with the Harts. 
In Allstate, this court determined that because the
 
term “any person” was not defined in the applicable automobile
 insurance policy, and given the context of the term’s usage, “any
 person” was ambiguous and should, therefore, be construed in
 
18
    
         
           
              
         
         
             
          
             
      *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
favor of the insured. 118 Hawai' i at 182, 186 P.3d at 617. 
Standing alone, an ambiguous term “should be interpreted 
according to its plain, ordinary, and accepted sense in common speech[.]” Id. (brackets and citation omitted). “However, this 
court need not do so if it appears from the policy that a different meaning is intended.”
15 Id. (internal quotation marks 
and citation omitted). Some terms have clear meaning when standing alone, but “that meaning can become ambiguous through the manner in which those terms are used throughout the policy.”
16 Id. at 183, 186 P.3d at 618 (internal brackets, 
ellipses, emphasis and citation omitted). 
As persuasive authority, in St. Paul Fire & Marine
 
Insurance Co. v. Hawaiian Insurance & Guaranty Co., 2 Haw. App.
 595, 637 P.2d 1146 (1981), the ICA adhered to the commonly
 accepted legal meaning of the term “claim” to determine that when
 an insurance policy contained no definition of “claim,” three
 
15
 In Allstate , this court considered the context of the ambiguous 
term’s use within the insurance policy; its analysis was “not confined to 
either a single clause or term in isolation from the rest of the policy.”Allstate , 118 Hawai 'i at 182, 186 P.3d at 617. 
16
 “In this regard, when terms are used selectively throughout the 
policy’s exclusions in such a way as to create the impression that they referto mutually exclusive classes, an ambiguity results, which must be resolvedagainst the insurer.” Allstate , 118 Hawai 'i at 182, 186 P.3d at 617 (internal
citations, quotation marks and brackets omitted). 
19
    
         
               
    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
separate acts of negligence17 resulted in three “claims” for 
purposes of the policy’s liability limitation clause. Though the 
ICA decided St. Paul Fire before this court’s landmark decisions in Sentinel and Dairy Road, the ICA correctly stated therein that “[i]nsurance contracts are contracts of adhesion . . . [;] they are to be liberally construed in favor of the insured and against the insurer.” Id. at 596, 637 P.2d at 1147 (citations omitted); 
see Dairy Road, 92 Hawai' i at 411-12, 992 P.2d at 106-07 
(“[I]nsurance policies are contracts of adhesion . . . [;] they must be construed liberally in favor of the insured and [any] ambiguities [must be] resolved against the insurer.”) (citations omitted, some brackets added). 
Unlike in Allstate, “claim” in the instant Policy is 
not used in different ways within the contract as to create ambiguity. Instead, as in St. Paul Fire, ambiguity arises here simply because “claim” is not defined in the Policy. Following the general construction rules explained in Dairy Road and Allstate, “claim” should be interpreted according to its plain, ordinary, and accepted sense in common speech consistent with the reasonable expectations of a layperson. See Dairy Road, 92 
Hawai'i at 412, 992 P.2d at 107 (this court construes insurance

policies in “accord with the reasonable expectations of a 
layperson”); see also Allstate, 118 Hawai' i at 182, 186 P.3d at 
617 (this court construes policy terms “according to their plain, ordinary, and accepted sense in common speech”). Any ambiguities must be liberally construed in favor of the insured. Dairy Road, 
92 Hawai' i at 411-412, 992 P.2d at 106-07. 
A “claim” includes any “interest or remedy recognized
 
at law; the means by which a person can obtain a privilege,
 possession, or enjoyment or a right or thing[.]”
18 Black’s Law
 
Dictionary 282 (9th ed. 2009). TICOR’s argument that “claim” is
 unambiguous and that the State did not assert a “claim” withing
 the meaning of the policy is unpersuasive. 
In this case, the State twice asserted that it had
 
“interest in or affecting [the property], which are as follows: .
 . . 6. The State reserves any interests in the property that may
 have escheated to the State.” Additionally, the State twice
 requested affirmative relief: “Wherefore, [the] State prays that
 the Court rules that: . . . 6. The State has reserved any
 interests in the property that may have escheated to the
 State[.]” We agree with the Harts that
 
18
 The term “claim” also includes “counterclaim” within its
 
definition.” Black’s Law Dictionary 282 (9th ed. 2009) (defining “claim” and
 
referring to the definition of “counterclaim”); id. at 402 (defining
 
“counterclaim” as “[a] claim for relief asserted against an opposing party
after an original claim has been made; esp., a defendant’s claim in opposition
to or as a setoff against the plaintiff’s claim.”).
 
21
    
        
         
          
          
        
        
         
          
          
           
         
    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
[t]hrough the reservation, the State alleged it had existing
rights and interest in the [p]roperty that may “have escheated”
 and that those rights and interest would be noted against the
Harts’ Land Court-registered title. . . . The State’s escheat
 reservation was an independent and affirmative claim to an
interest in the Harts’ [p]roperty, just like every other
 “reserv[ation]” made in the State’s pleadings. For example, the
 State reserved “the rights of native tenants in the property,” and
 “an easement for the free flowage of waters through, over, under,
and across the property.” The State prevailed on some of those
claimed interests and lost on others. Those reservations plainly
 sought to assert “claims.”
 
A layperson would have construed the State’s escheat language as
 
the State asserting a claim against the Harts’ title. Moreover,
 interpretation of the State’s escheat claim in accord with the
 ordinary, plain and common definition of “claim” indicates
 coverage under the Policy. Ambiguity surrounding the definition
 of “claim” should have been construed for the Harts and in favor
 of coverage.
 
Ultimately, because “claim” is not defined in the
 
Policy, and because the State’s allegations twice sought to
 establish the State’s present escheat interest in the Harts’
 insured property and twice requested affirmative relief regarding
 its present escheat interest, the State’s reservation fell within
 the broad, common definition of “claim” as covered under the
 Policy. The ICA erred in construing this ambiguity in favor of
 TICOR and by concluding that the State failed to assert an
 escheat claim. 
2.	 The insurer’s duty to defend arises at the mere
potential of coverage under a policy.

           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The obligation of an insurer to defend an insured is
 
distinct from the duty to provide coverage. Pancakes of Haw.,
 
Inc. v. Promare Prop. Corp., 85 Hawai' i 286, 291, 944 P.2d 83, 88 
(1997). Indeed, an insurer’s duty to defend is “broader than the
 
duty to pay claims and arises wherever there is the mere
 potential for coverage[]” under a policy. Dairy Road, 92 Hawai' i 
at 412, 992 P.2d at 107 (quoting Sentinel, 76 Hawai' i at 287, 875 
P.2d at 904) (emphasis in original). This obligation to defend
 “rests primarily on the possibility that coverage exists. This
 possibility may be remote but if it exists, the insurer owes the
 insured a defense.” Id. (quoting Sentinel, 76 Hawai' i at 287, 
875 P.2d at 904) (emphasis in original, brackets omitted). 
Indeed, an insurer’s duty to defend attaches when the language of
 the pleadings may plausibly be read as asserting a present claim,
 as is the case here.
19 “The duty to defend is not
 
19
 We do not condone any attempt to create an insurer’s duty to 
defend by “artful pleading” of a claim or defense which has no legitimate
basis in the facts alleged or issues raised in the pleadings. In Dairy Road ,
this court expressly intended to “ensure that plaintiffs could not, throughartful pleading, bootstrap the availability of insurance coverage under aninsured defendant’s policy by purporting to state a claim for negligence basedon facts that, in reality, reflected manifestly intentional, rather thannegligent, conduct.” Dairy Road , 92 Hawai 'i at 417, 992 P.2d at 112
(approvingly citing the primary purpose in Hawaiian Ins. & Guar. Co. v.
Brooks, 67 Haw. 285, 686 P.2d 23 (1984) (overruled on other grounds) and

on other grounds) and noting “[w]ith respect to the facts as alleged withinthe four corners of a complaint, we do not disturb the Brooks/Blanco

P.2d at 89. Furthermore, “an insurer’s ultimate non-liability should not free it from its concurrent [and distinct] contractual duty to defend.” First Ins. Co., 66 Haw. at 420, 665 P.2d at 653 
(internal quotation marks omitted). 
The insurer must employ “a good-faith analysis of all
 
information known to the insured or all information reasonably
 ascertainable by inquiry and investigation[]” to determine
 whether the possibility of coverage under a policy exists.

 In Pancakes of Haw. , this court explained the reasoning supporting 
an insurer’s broad duty to defend when extending and applying such reasoning
to contract indemnity clauses. See 85 Hawai 'i at 292-93, 944 P.2d at 88-89.

Inc., 767 F.2d 810, 812 (11th Cir. 1985)) (brackets omitted). 
In summary, the pleadings underlying the Harts’ tender
 
reveal that TICOR had a duty to defend the Harts, determined at
 the time the State asserted the escheat claim because, at that
 time, the language of the State’s answer, answer to amended
 petition, and affirmative prayers for relief, plausibly asserted
 a present claim of escheat, and TICOR conceded that a claim of
 escheat is not excluded from coverage under the Policy. We agree
 with the Harts that “[o]nce the possibility of coverage triggered
 the duty to defend, TICOR had the duty to defend, regardless of
 whether the allegations were ‘groundless, false, or fraudulent’
 or whether some of the claims ‘[fell] outside of the policy’s
 coverage.’” The fact that the State ultimately clarified that it
 was “not pursuing any claim of escheat to the State[]” did not
 excuse TICOR from its initial duty to defend. See Hart, 2011 WL
 
2938210, at *1 n.2. Considering the specific and unique facts of
 this case, the ICA erred in concluding that TICOR did not have a
 duty to defend the Harts. Id. at *1.
 
Additionally, we disagree with the ICA’s conclusion
 
that the State’s escheat claim did not trigger TICOR’s duty to
 defend the Harts because the State failed to follow the proper
 
25

procedure for bringing an escheat claim under HRS § 665-1 (1993). 
Id. 	By so concluding, the ICA improperly tied TICOR’s duty to
 defend to the sufficiency or merits of the State’s pleading. Put
 differently, the ICA erroneously made TICOR’s duty to defend
 contingent upon the outcome or ultimate sufficiency of the
 State’s escheat claim. 
B.	 The ICA erred in affirming the district court’s award of
attorneys’ fees and costs to TICOR.

 TICOR since the Harts are now the prevailing party.

For the reasons stated herein, we hold that TICOR owed
 
a duty to defend the Harts under the Policy against the State’s
 escheat claim and prayer for affirmative relief. Accordingly, we
 vacate the ICA’s judgment, and reverse the judgment of the
 district court in favor of TICOR. We also vacate the district
 court’s award of attorneys’ fees and costs to TICOR. We remand
 the case to the district court with instructions (1) to enter
 judgment in favor of the Harts, and (2) to determine an award of
 attorneys’ fees and costs to the Harts, with the specific
 instruction that the Harts’ award be limited to the period of

No 
other costs of court shall be charged in any court in addition
to those prescribed in this chapter in any suit, action, or other
proceeding, except as otherwise provided by law.
 
All actual disbursements, including but not limited to, intrastate
travel expenses for witnesses and counsel, expenses for deposition
transcript originals and copies, and other incidental expenses,
including copying costs, intrastate long distance telephone
charges, and postage, sworn to by an attorney or a party, and
deemed reasonable by the court, may be allowed in taxation of
costs. In determining whether and what costs should be taxed, the
court may consider the equities of the situation.

 In oral argument, the Harts’ counsel argued that “the duty to
 
defend continues through the resolution of the claim including any possible
appeal, so the fees cut off at the resolution of the claim including final
judgment and any possible appeal.” We hold that the Harts are entitled to
 attorneys’ fees and costs related to their covered escheat claim beginning
with the Harts’ tender of defense to TICOR on November 7, 2005, and ending
upon the Land Court’s final written resolution of the State’s escheat claim in
its December 5, 2007 order.
