OPINION OF THE COURT BY ACOBA, J.
 
We hold that the charge for Operating a Vehicle Under 
the Influence of an Intoxicant, (OVUII), HRS § 261E-61(a)(1) 
(2007) was insufficient because Respondent/Plaintiff-Appellee the State of Hawai' i (the State) failed to allege the requisite 
states of mind of intentional, knowing, or reckless in the

charge, State v. Apollonio, --- P.3d ----, 2013 WL 5574921, at *5 
(Haw. Oct. 10, 2013); see also State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai' i 48, 
1
54, 276 P.3d 617, 623 (2012) , and because the charge failed toallege an “essential fact[] constituting the offense charged.” Hawai'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 7(d). Accordingly, 
the conviction of Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant Peter Newal Maharaj (Defendant) is dismissed without prejudice. The November 23, 2012 judgment of the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA),
2 
filed pursuant to its October 25, 2012 Summary Disposition Order (SDO), having been to the contrary in affirming Defendant’s conviction, as well as the November 18, 2008 Judgment of conviction of the District Court of the First Circuit (the 
3
court) are therefore vacated.
I. 
A.
 
According to Defendant, he “was orally charged on April 
10, 2008 with Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant, (OVUII), Hawai' i Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§§ 291E­
4 5 6
61(a)(1)  & (b)(1)  (2007).”  Defendant states the “oral charge

61(a)(1) was insufficient for failing to state the requisite mens rea.
Nesmith , 127 Hawai 'i at 53, 276 P.3d at 622.

 The SDO was filed by Chief Judge Craig H. Nakamura, and Associate
 
Judges Daniel R. Foley and Katherine G. Leonard

 The Honorable William A. Cardwell presided.

 HRS § 291E-61(a)(1), OVUII, states that “A person commits the
 
offense of operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the
person operates or assumes physical control of a vehicle [w]hile under the
influence of alcohol in an amount sufficient to impair the person’s normal

     ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
was reduced to an Order and Notice of Entry of Order [(Order)] on
 
that same date.” He maintains “the [Order] does not clearly
 state in writing the specific allegations of the charge against
 [Defendant]” and “does not allege the relevant mens rea as there
 is no reference to an intentional, knowing or reckless state of
 mind in the charge.” Thus, Defendant points out, “the Order
 merely states that the violation charged is HRS [§] 291E-61[.]” 
A “Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment
 [(Judgment)] was entered against [Defendant] on November 18,
 2008.” 
B.
 
Defendant appealed to the ICA on December 11, 2008. On
 
appeal, Defendant argued that “(1) he received ineffective
 assistance of counsel because his trial counsel failed to
 introduce [his] medical records into evidence; (2) there was
 insufficient evidence to support [Defendant’s] conviction; and
 (3) [the court] erred in denying [Defendant’s] motion to suppress evidence.” State v. Maharaj, No. 29520, 2012 WL 5272227 (Hawai' i 
mental faculties or ability to care for the person and guard against

 HRS § 291E-61(b)(1) states that “A person committing the offense
 
of operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant shall be sentenced
without possibility of probation or suspension of sentence ... [f]or the first
offence, or any offence not preceded within a five-year period by a conviction
for an offence under this section or section 291E-4(a).”
 
6
 In its Answering Brief the State indicates Defendant, “may have
 
been charged with HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) (breath alcohol greater than 0.08)” but
 “no breath alcohol measurement was taken.”

      ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
App. Oct. 25, 2012) (SDO).7 The transcript of the second part of
 
Defendant’s trial was made a part of the record on appeal. 
However, the ICA noted that “[t]he transcript for the September
 29, 2008, hearing on the motion to suppress evidence and the
 beginning of trial was not made part of the record on appeal.” 
Maharaj, 2012 WL 5272227 at *1. The ICA affirmed the court’s
 judgment on October 25, 2012. 
This court filed the decision in Nesmith on April 12,
 
2012. 
Defendant filed a Motion for Reconsideration with the 
ICA on November 5, 2012, arguing that the charge against him was jurisdictionally defective since it did not “allege the requisite mens rea. . . .” (Citing Nesmith, 127 Hawai' i 48, 276 P.3d 617.) 
In this motion, Defendant contended that the charge was “facially defective” and that the court “lacked subject matter jurisdiction,” which was “not waivable.” The State did not file a response to Defendant’s reconsideration motion contesting Defendant’s recitation of the contents of the charge. Nevertheless, the ICA denied Defendant’s Motion for Reconsideration on November 14, 2012, citing its decision in State v. Rivera, No. CAAP-11-0000774, 2012 WL 4344185 at *1 (App. Sept. 24, 2012) (SDO). State v. Maharaj, No. 29520, 2102 WL 
5272227 at *1 (App. Nov. 14, 2012) (SDO). 
7
 Petitioner does not raise any of these points in his Application
 
and so we do not consider them.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
In Rivera, the ICA held in pertinent part, “the supreme
court’s decision in [Nesmith] raises, but does not clearly
answer, the question of whether a deficiency in a charge forfailing to allege the requisite mens rea is a jurisdictionaldefect.”  (Quoting Rivera, 2012 WL 4344185 at *2.)  The ICA
adopted what it construed as the concurring and dissentingopinion’s reading of the majority opinion in Nesmith,
[i]n Nesmith,  the concurring and dissenting opinion by
Justice Acoba reads the majority opinion as concluding ‘that
a state of mind is a ‘fact’ that must be included in an HRS
§ 291-E-61(a)(1) charge for due process purposes only, butnot an element of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) that must be included
in a charge for purposes of jurisdiction.’  Although the
Nesmith  majority opinion does not state this distinction
between the sufficiency of a charge for due process purposes
and for jurisdictional purposes in unmistakable terms,
pending further clarification, we adopt Justice Acoba’s
reading of the majority’s opinion.  
Id. (quoting Nesmith, 127 Hawai# i at 66, 276 P.3d at 635 (Acoba,
J., concurring and dissenting) (brackets omitted)).  In Rivera,
the ICA concluded that the State’s failure to allege the mens reawas not a jurisdictional defect and because the said “defect” wasnot previously raised by Defendant, it was waived by Defendant. 
Under this  reading, the failure to allege a mens rea in  the
charge of OVUII with priors against Rivera  would not
constitute  a jurisdictional defect in the charge.  We
therefore conclude that Rivera waived any challenge to the
sufficiency of the charge for failure to allege a mens rea
by not objecting on  this basis in the Circuit Court and  by
not asserting this claim on appeal.
Id. (emphasis added).  Accordingly, the ICA in Rivera affirmedthe defendant’s conviction of the charge of OVUII.  Relying on
Rivera, the ICA denied Defendant’s Motion for Reconsideration,
apparently because it believed any challenge to the sufficiencyof the charge by Defendant was waived.  In doing so, the ICA
5        
     ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
stated in a single sentence that the motion was denied and cited
 
Rivera. 
III.
 
In his Application, Defendant asks whether “the failure
 
to allege a mens rea in charging the offense of OVUII . . . HRS
 section 291E-61(a)(1) renders the charge jurisdictionally
 defective?” No response was filed by the State. 
IV.
 As noted, a transcript of the first part of trial,
 
which presumably included the reading of the charge, was not in
 the record. Thus, Defendant in his application cited to the
 Notice of Entry of Order and the Notice of Judgment in order to
 establish the specific charges herein. The docket entry
 indicates Defendant was charged with HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) and
 (b)(1).
8 None of the parties or the ICA indicated that Defendant
 
raised an objection to the lack of a mens rea allegation in the
 charge at the beginning of the trial. Defendant’s objection to
 jurisdiction apparently was raised for the first time in the
 Motion for Reconsideration itself.
 
On May 2, 2013 we ordered the record on appeal be
 
supplemented with the April 10, 2008 transcript containing the
 oral charge. The point of error that Defendant raised in his

         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Motion for Reconsideration before the ICA and raised on appeal to
 
this court was only apparent after this court’s decision in
 Nesmith. Inasmuch as the ICA ruled on the applicability of
 Nesmith to Defendant’s case, the record may be supplemented to
 determine the correctness of that decision. This is true even if
 there may have been no error under the applicable law at the time
 of the original appeal to the ICA, prior to this court’s decision
 in Nesmith. See Henderson v. United States, 133 S.Ct. 1121
 
(2013) (holding that “we conclude that whether a legal question
 was settled or unsettled at the time of trial, ‘it is enough that
 an error be ‘plain’ at the time of appellate consideration . . .
 .’”). 
However, on June 8, 2013, the court filed a letter
 
indicating that “research was conducted, and we were unable to
 locate the CD recording for the court date of April 10, 2008 as
 you had requested.” Accordingly, a transcript of the charge is
 not available. Nevertheless, before the ICA and on certiorari
 none of the parties indicate the state of mind was alleged by the
 State in the OVUII charge, and the ICA proceeded to decide the
 reconsideration motion without a transcript of the charge. 
Accordingly, we proceed to the merits of the Application.
 
V.
 
Defendant maintains that the omission of the state of
 
mind in the charge was a jurisdictional defect and “[w]hether a
 court possesses subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law
 
7
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
reviewable de novo.” (Quoting Hawai' i Mgmt. Alliance Ass’n v. 
Ins. Comm’r, 106 Hawai' i 21, 26, 100 P.3d 952, 957 (2004).) 
Consequently, he argues “if the parties do not raise the issue, a 
court sua sponte will, for unless jurisdiction of the court over the subject matter exists, any judgment rendered is invalid.” (Quoting Chun v. Employees’ Ret. Sys. of the State of Hawai' i, 73 
Hawai'i 9, 14, 828 P.2d 260, 263 (1992).) 
A.
 
Apparently disagreeing with the ICA’s denial of 
reconsideration, Defendant states that this court “has held that a charge of [OVUII] under [HRS §] 291E-61(a)(1) that does not allege the requisite mens rea and/or does not allege in writing a plain, concise and definite statement of essential facts constituting the offense is fatally defective.” Referring to the relevant statutory provisions, he declares, “(1) [t]here is no state of mind specified within HRS [§] 291E-61(a)(1) itself, (2) as such, HRS [§] 702-204 applies, and states in relevant part, ‘When the state of mind required to establish an element of an offense is not specified by law, that element is established if, with respect thereto, a person acts intentionally, knowingly or recklessly.’” (citing HRS § 702-204); and that (3) “a state of mind with which the defendant acts applies to all elements of the offense, unless otherwise specified in the statute defining the offense[.]” (Quoting State v. Vliet, 95 Hawai' i 94, 99, 19 P.3d 
42, 47 (2001)(citations omitted).) (Citing HRS § 702-206 (1993).) 
8
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
B.
 
Defendant additionally states, “[p]er Nesmith . . .
 
‘the [HRS § 291E-61(a)(1)] charge shall be a plain, concise and
 
definite statement of the essential facts constituting the
 offense charged.’” (Quoting HRPP Rule 7(d) (2009)). “‘A charge
 defective in this regard amounts to a failure to state an
 offense, and a conviction based upon it cannot be sustained, for
 that would constitute a denial of due process.’” (Quoting State
 v. Mita, 124 Hawai' i 385, 390, 245 P.3d 458, 463 (2010).) 
Defendant reads Nesmith as holding “that a charge
 
alleging a violation of HRS [§] 291E-61(a)(1) that omits the
 statutorily incorporated culpable states of mind from HRS [§]
 702-204 is not readily comprehensible to persons of common
 understanding and, as such, a charge omitting the allegation of
 mens rea is deficient for failing to provide fair notice to the
 accused.” Additionally, “there was never even a plain, concise
 and definite written statement of the essential facts
 constituting the offense charged provided to [Defendant] in
 violation of HRPP [Rules] 7(a) and (d)[.]” 
He asserts that because “the essential facts of the
 
OVUII charge against [Defendant] under HRS [§] 261E-61(a)(1) were
 not provided to [Defendant] and the charge did not allege the
 requisite mens rea, the charge is fatally defective[.]” In
 Defendant’s view, “[t]he Nesmith [c]ourt clearly held that a 
9
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
deficiency in a charge for failing to allege the requisite mens
 
rea is a jurisdictional defect.”
 
VI.
 
A.
 
In this case, Defendant challenged the sufficiency of 
the oral charge for the first time on appeal. Therefore, pursuant to State v. Motta, the indictment will be dismissed if “the defendant can show prejudice or that the indictment cannot within reason be construed to charge a crime.” 66 Haw. 89, 91, 657 P.2d 1019, 1020 (1983). In the instant case, the oral charge omitted the requisite state of mind. Therefore, based on precedent, the oral charge cannot within reason be construed to charge a crime. State v. Elliot, 77 Hawai' i 309, 313, 884 P.2d 
372, 376 (1994) (applying the liberal construction standard and holding that “the requisite state of mind was omitted from the charge” and therefore the court “perceive[d] no way . . . [to] reasonably construe [the indictment] to charge resisting arrest or any included offense”). Thus, the charge is “fatally defective.” Id. 
In Nesmith, the majority cited Elliot with approval. 
The Nesmith majority acknowledged that “[i]n Elliott, the Defendant challenged the sufficiency of this oral charge for the first time on appeal.” 127 Hawai' i at 56, 276 P.3d at 625. 
Nesmith then drew an analogy to Elliot involving an objection to the lack of a state of mind allegation. The majority stated that 
10
         
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
“[l]ike Elliott, in this case, the intentional, knowing, or
 
reckless” state of mind requirements . . . needed to be charged .
 . . to alert the defendants of precisely what they needed to
 defend against to avoid a conviction.” Id. (emphasis added). 
The concurring and dissenting opinion in Nesmith also cited
 Elliot with approval, noting that Elliot demonstrates that the
 requisite state of mind “must be alleged in a charge.” Id. at
 
64, 276 P.3d at 633 (Acoba, J., concurring and dissenting).
 
Recently, in Apollonio, this court again held that a
 
charge that fails to allege the requisite state of mind is
 defective, even if the defendant challenges the sufficiency of
 the charge for the first time on appeal. 2013 WL 5574921 at *5. 
Apollonio re-affirmed the “core principle” that “[a] charge that
 fails to charge a requisite state of mind cannot be construed
 reasonable to state an offense and thus the charge is dismissed
 without prejudice because it violates due process.” Id. at *5.
 
Even after trial began in this case Defendant was not 
informed of the “state of mind requirements” of the charges against him due to the defective charge. Nesmith, 127 Hawai' i at 
56, 276 P.3d at 625 (majority opinion). The failure to inform Defendant persisted to the end of trial due to the defective charge. In the absence of the requisite state of mind, the charge cannot within reason be construed to charge a crime. Apollonio, 2013 WL 5574921 at *5; see also Elliot, 77 Hawai' i at 
313, 884 P.2d at 376. Therefore, under Nesmith and Apollonio, 
11
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the defective complaint in this case is dismissed without 
prejudice. Apollonio, 2013 WL 5574921 at *5; see also Nesmith, 
127 Hawai' i at 54, 276 P.3d at 623. 
B.
 
Defendant also argues that the charge is defective for
 
failing to allege the “essential facts” as required by HRPP Rule
 7(d). Although Nesmith did not apply HRPP Rule 7(d), the clear
 import of Nesmith is that state of mind is an “essential fact”
 that must be pled under HRPP Rule 7(d). Nesmith stated that
 
although “mens rea is not an ‘element of an offense,’” more than
 the failure to allege elements was “fatal to a charge.” Id. at
 
55, 276 P.3d at 624. This court then held that Elliot “provides
 one illustration of how omission of facts in a charge can render
 a charge deficient,” and concluded that “mens rea must be alleged
 in a [charge].” Id. at 55-56, 276 P.3d at 624-25 (emphases
 
added). As a “fact” that “must be alleged in a charge,” a
 requisite state of mind is clearly an “essential fact” that must
 be alleged under HRPP Rule 7(d). 
Moreover, Nesmith recognized that if a charge is 
insufficient under HRPP Rule 7(d), then “‘a conviction based upon [the charge] cannot be sustained, for that would constitute a denial of due process.’” Id. at 52, 275 P.3d at 622 (quoting 
Mita, 124 Hawai' i at 390, 245 P.3d at 463). Therefore, the 
failure to plead an essential fact under HRPP Rule 7(d) provides 
12
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
an additional basis for the dismissal of the charge without
 
prejudice.
 
VII.
 
Accordingly, the ICA’s November 23, 2012 judgment and
 
the court’s November 18, 2008 judgment of conviction are vacated
 and the case remanded to the court to enter an order dismissing
 the case without prejudice.
