OPINION OF THE COURT BY COURT NAKAYAMA, J.
 
Petitioner-Defendant-Appellant Robert N. Tominiko
 
(“Tominiko”) asks us to consider whether he was lawfully detained
 
and subsequently charged with operating a vehicle under the
 influence of an intoxicant. 
The facts presented at trial show
 
that Tominiko was near an intersection with a gathering of people
 who were drinking beer and soda. Upon receipt of a complaint, a
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
police officer arrived but did not see Tominiko drinking beer. 
The group dispersed, and Tominiko walked slowly to his car. The
 officer asked to see his identification, but Tominiko continued
 walking to his car and got in. When the officer asked Tominiko
 to exit his vehicle, Tominiko drove away slowly. The officer
 chased Tominiko and told him to stop driving but Tominiko drove
 seven feet before being stopped by a vehicle traveling in the
 opposite direction. The officer then caught up with Tominiko,
 and, while approaching Tominiko’s vehicle, noticed beer bottles
 in Tominiko’s car. Tominiko was subsequently charged in part
 with Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant
 (“OVUII”) and Driving Without Motor Vehicle Insurance. The
 Driving Without Motor Vehicle Insurance charge contained the
 allegation that the conduct occurred on a public roadway, but the
 OVUII charge did not. The District Court of the First Circuit
 (“district court”) convicted Tominiko of OVUII, and he appealed. 
In his application for writ of certiorari, Tominiko presents the
 following questions: 1) “Whether the [Intermediate Court of
 Appeals (“ICA”)] gravely erred in concluding that Tominiko’s
 conviction would not be reversed due to the insufficiency of the
 [OVUII] charge[;]” and 2) “Whether the ICA gravely erred in
 concluding that the trial court did not err in denying Tominiko’s
 motion to suppress under the totality of the circumstances in
 this case.” We hold that: 1) the charge was not insufficient
 
2
       
        
         
        
         
       
          
  
    
          
    
       
         
      
         
           
        *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
under the liberal construction standard because, when reading the
 
charge as a whole, it can be reasonably construed to charge a
 crime; and 2) Tominiko was subjected to an illegal seizure and
 the evidence obtained as a result of that seizure must be
 suppressed.

revoked, thereby committing the offense of Operating a
Vehicle After License And Privilege Have Been Suspended or
Revoked for Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of An
Intoxicant in violation of Section 291E-62(a)(1) and/or
(a)(2) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes . ROBERT TOMINIKO is
 
subject to sentencing as a first offender in accordance with
Section 291E-62(b)(1) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes .
(08282586) On or about the 2nd day of August, 2008, in
the City and County of Honolulu State of Hawaii, ROBERT
TOMINIKO did operate or use a motor vehicle upon a public
street, road, or highway of the State of Hawaii at a time
when such motor vehicle was not insured under a motor
 vehicle insurance policy, thereby committing the offense of
Driving Without Motor Vehicle Insurance, in violation of
Section 431:10C-104(a) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes .
ROBERT TOMINIKO is subject to sentencing as a first offender
in accordance with Section 431:10C-117(a) of the Hawaii
Revised Statutes .
 
(Some Emphasis Added.) 
The latter two charges were dismissed at trial. 
Tominiko did not object to the charge or move to dismiss it at
 
any point during the district court’s proceedings. State v.
 
Tominiko, No. 29535 at 2 (App. June 30, 2010) (mem.) (lead
 opinion).
 
On December 1, 2008, Tominiko orally moved to suppress
 
evidence because the police officer did not have reasonable
 suspicion to stop Tominiko.
 
At the hearing on the motion to suppress, Officer
 
Antwan Stuart (“Officer Stuart”) testified that he was on duty at
 around midnight on the night in question, when he was dispatched
 to investigate a report that a group of people was arguing at an
 
intersection. When he arrived, he saw approximately fifteen or
 
twenty people drinking beer and soda, and eating. Members of the
 
5
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
group started picking up items, and running or walking away
 
quickly. Tominiko started walking towards his vehicle, which was
 the only vehicle parked in the area. Officer Stuart asked for
 Tominiko’s identification because Tominiko “was the only person
 that didn’t leave in a hurry” and he was able to detain Tominiko. 
Officer Stuart was interested in obtaining Tominiko’s
 identification to “investigate what was going on over there, if
 
indeed there was a[n] argument or if there was a fight.” Officer
 
Stuart also knew that a lot of people drink in that area.
 
Tominiko mumbled something, kept walking, got into his
 
car, and tried to start his car. Officer Stuart followed
 
Tominiko to the car and asked him to exit the vehicle, but
 Tominiko started the car and slowly drove away. Officer Stuart
 chased Tominiko, and told him to stop driving. Tominiko drove
 about seven feet, before a vehicle coming from the opposite
 direction forced him to stop.
 
Officer Stuart approached Tominiko’s window and
 
directed his flashlight at the back seat of Tominiko’s car to see
 if anyone else was in the car. He noticed empty forty-ounce beer
 bottles in Tominiko’s car. He asked Tominiko to turn off the car
 and provide identification. Tominiko said he left his license at
 home, but had a state identification card.
 
On cross-examination, Officer Stuart testified that as
 
6
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
he approached the intersection, he heard people talking loudly,
 
but could not determine if there had been an argument. No one
 was fighting when he approached the intersection. He did not
 remember Tominiko having a beer bottle in his hand when he first
 saw Tominiko.
 
After the hearing, the district court denied Tominiko’s
 
motion to suppress. The district court made the following oral
 findings and conclusions:
 
My  obligation  is  to  state  my  essential  findings  on  the
record  in  a  motion  to  suppress.   My  essential  findings  are
that  at  approximately  midnight  on  August  2nd,  2008,  Officer
Stuart  was  dispatched  to  investigate  a  possible  argument
call  where  15  people  are  arguing  at  Ahonui  and  School
Street.
 
He  arrived  on  the  scene.   He  saw  a  group  of  15  or  20
people  eating  and  drinking,  including  drinking  beer.   It
 
appeared  to  be  a  social  gathering.   There  was  loud  talk.   He
 
could  not  tell  if  that  talk  was  arguing,  but  there  was  no
physical  fighting.
He  approached  defendant  to  investigate  and  what  -­
what  is  going,  ask  for  his  I.D.  [sic]   Defendant  kept  going,
 
went  to  a  car.   Officer  approached  [sic]  and  asked  him  out
of  the  car  [sic]  so  he  could  continue  his  investigation  and
get  the  I.D.   Defendant  ignored  that  request,  started  the
car,  attempted  to  drive  away,  and  got  blocked  by  another
 
car.   And  he  said  he  left  his  license  -- told  the  officer  he
 
left  his  license  at  home.   And  there  were  empty  beer  bottles
 
in  the  back  of  the  car.
 
Based  upon  that,  it’s  my  conclusion  that  there  was
reasonable  suspicion  for  Officer  Stuart  to  stop  the
defendant.   A  reasonable  officer  in  Officer  Stuart’s
 
position,  had  reasonable  suspicion  to  believe  that  there  was
criminal  activity  afoot  and  therefore  had  the  right  to  stop
defendant.
 
And  once  defendant  refused  to  comply  with  his  simple
request  for  identification,  the  officer  had  the  further
right  to  pursue  the  defendant  and  stop  him.
So  I  will  deny  the  motion.
 
The district court held a stipulated facts trial. The
 
police report was stipulated into evidence, and part of it
 
7
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
stated:
 
Upon  arrival,  I  observed  a  green  Isuzu  Trooper  bearing
Hawaii  license  plate  [******]  parked  on  the  right  side  of
Ahonui  St.  about  20  feet  from  N.  School  St.   Standing  around
the  vehicle  were  about  12  male  [sic]  eating  and  drinking.
  
As  I  parked  behind  the  Isuzu,  everyone  started  to  run  and
walk  away.   I  told  one  male  who  was  trying  to  get  inside  the
Isuzu  to  stop  and  show  me  some  identification.   The  male  got
inside  the  Isuzu  started  it  up  and  put  the  vehicle  in  drive.
 
I  yelled  at  the  male  to  turn  off  the  vehicle  and  show  me  his
identification.   The  male  started  driving  off  slowly.   I  ran
 
up  to  the  driver  door  and  told  the  male  to  stop  the  car  and
turn  off  the  engine.   The  male  continued  driving  for  about
another  7  feet  when  he  had  to  stop,  due  to  another  vehicle
traveling  in  the  opposite  direction  which  had  to  stop  in
front  of  his  car  due  to  traffic  congestion.   I  again  told
the  male  to  turn  off  the  vehicle  and  show  me  his
 
identification.   I  could  see  two  empty  40oz  bottles  of  Old
English  sitting  on  top  of  the  back  seat  directly  behind  the
driver.
 
A breath test was also administered to Tominiko, and
 
the result was .160. Tominiko was found guilty of OVUII, but
 
found not guilty as a highly intoxicated driver.
 
B. The ICA’s June 30, 2010 Memorandum Opinion
 
1. Lead opinion
 
Tominiko subsequently appealed his conviction,
 
asserting that: 1) “The prosecution’s written and oral charges
 for OVUII were fatally insufficient because they failed to allege
 the essential element that Tominiko operated or assumed actual
 physical control of a vehicle ‘upon a public way, street, road,
 or highway[;]’” and 2) “The district court erred when it denied a
 motion to suppress, because under the totality of the
 circumstances the stop of Tominiko was not justified by specific
 
8
       
         
        
      
             
          
        
       
        
        
        
            
       *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
and articulable facts that Tominiko was engaged in criminal
 
activity.” Tominiko, mem. op. at 1. The ICA issued three
 
opinions on this matter.
 
The lead opinion held that the prosecution’s charges
 
were not insufficient. It observed that, in State v. Wheeler,
 this court stated:
 
[T]his court has applied different principles
depending on whether or not an objection was timely raised
in the trial court . Under the “ Motta/Wells post-conviction
 
liberal construction rule,” we liberally construe charges
challenged for the first time on appeal . . . . Under this
 approach, there is a “presumption of validity,” . . . for
 charges challenged subsequent to a conviction. In those
 circumstances, this court will “not reverse a conviction
 based upon a defective indictment [or complaint] unless the
defendant can show prejudice or that the indictment [or
complaint] cannot within reason be construed to charge a
crime.” . . . . However, the rule does not apply when
reviewing timely motions challenging the sufficiency of an
indictment.
 
Id. at 4 (quoting State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai' i 383, 399-400, 219 
P.3d 1170, 1186-87 (2009)). 
Applying the Motta/Wells liberal construction standard,
 
the lead opinion held that Tominiko’s conviction was not
 
insufficient. Id. at 7. It observed that under the Motta/Wells
 
standard, Tominiko was required to prove either prejudice or that
 the charge cannot within reason be construed to charge a crime
 and held that Tominiko did not make either showing. Id. at 5.
 
With respect to prejudice, the lead opinion observed
 
that Tominiko did not assert prejudice, but instead argued that
 he did not need to show prejudice. Id. It held that prejudice
 
9
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
is a factor under the liberal construction standard, and Tominiko
 
had failed to show prejudice. Id.
 
With respect to the failure to charge a crime, the lead 
opinion held that “it is proper to ‘consider other information in addition to the charge that may have been provided to the defendant during the course of the case up until the time defendant objected to the sufficiency of the charges against him.’” Id. (quoting Wheeler, 121 Hawai' i at 396, 219 P.3d at 
1183). It observed that the third paragraph of the complaint charges Tominiko with Driving Without Motor Vehicle Insurance on the day of the incident and alleges that Tominiko “did operate or use a motor vehicle upon a public street, road, or highway of the State of Hawai' i.” Id. at 6 (internal quotation marks omitted). 
It held that “[b]ecause each of these paragraphs state that the events occurred ‘[o]n or about the 2nd day of August, 2008, in the City and County of Honolulu, State of Hawai' i,’ it is 
reasonable to construe that they arise from the same event.” Id. 
The lead opinion also held that from “the stipulated
 
facts in the police report, it can be reasonably construed that
 the OVUII offense occurred on a public street or road.” Id. For
 
instance, it observed that the police report stipulated into
 evidence states that the place of offense is “AHONUI ST/N. SCHOOL
 ST HONOLULU, HI 96819.” Id. Additionally, the “police report
 
10
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
also states that the vehicle operated by Tominiko was ‘parked on
 
the right side of Ahonui St. about 20 feet from N. School St.’,
 and that while being asked for his identification Tominiko got in
 his car, started to drive off slowly, but ‘had to stop, due to
 another vehicle traveling in the opposite direction which had to
 stop in front of his car due to traffic congestion.’” Id. Thus,
 
the lead opinion held that under the liberal construction
 standard, the charge could be reasonably construed to charge a
 crime. Id. at 6-7.
 
With respect to Tominiko’s second point of error, the
 
lead opinion held that Tominiko was seized “when Officer Stuart
 followed Tominiko to his vehicle, asked him to get out and, as
 Tominiko started to drive away, Officer Stuart yelled at Tominiko
 to stop.” Id. at 10. However, it held that “[n]otwithstanding
 
that a seizure did occur, Officer Stuart had reasonable suspicion
 sufficient to support an investigatory stop.” Id. It observed
 
that “there had been the call to police of about 15 people
 arguing at that location; Tominiko was among the group of
 individuals at that location; it was midnight; the group was
 standing around the Isuzu Trooper that Tominiko would attempt to
 drive away; the vehicle and the group were located by the
 intersection of two public streets; some members of the group
 were observed talking loudly and drinking beer; and this was an
 
11
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
area where Officer Stuart knew people liked to drink.” Id. at
 
11. It held that based “on the totality of the circumstances at
 
this point, there are specific and articulable facts to support
 
reasonable suspicion of criminal activity afoot, including
 disorderly conduct and possession of unsealed containers of
 intoxicating liquor on a public street.” Id. (footnote omitted). 
It also held that “combined with the facts set forth above and
 under the circumstances of this case, Tominiko’s effort to leave
 the scene was an added factor supporting reasonable suspicion.” 
Id. at 12.
 
Finally, the lead opinion held that “even if there was
 
an improper seizure at the point Officer Stuart asked Tominiko to
 exit or to stop his car, there were no fruits from such seizure”
 because Tominiko drove away from Officer Stuart and was forced to
 stop by another vehicle. Id. at 13. At that point, Officer
 
Stuart noticed the empty beer bottles. Id. The district court’s
 
December 1, 2008, judgment was therefore affirmed. Id. at 14.
 
2. Concurring opinion
 The concurrence “agree[d] with the lead opinion that
 
under the ‘liberal construction’ standard for post-trial
 challenges to the sufficiency of a charge, the charge against
 [Tominiko] for operating a vehicle under the influence of an
 intoxicant . . . was sufficient.” Tominiko, concurring op. at 1
 
12
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
(Nakamura, C.J., concurring). The concurrence would have held 
that although “the OVUII charge set forth in the complaint failed to allege that Tominiko operated his vehicle ‘upon a public, way, street, road, or highway,’ the missing ‘public road’ allegation was supplied by a companion charge in the complaint for driving without insurance.” Id. The concurring opinion observed that in 
“State v. Elliot, 77 Hawai' i 309, 312, 884 P.2d 372, 375 (1994), 
the Hawai' i Supreme Court, applying the liberal construction 
standard, concluded that one way in which a otherwise deficient count can be reasonably construed to charge a crime is by examining companion counts with which the defendant was charged.” Id. Based on that analysis, the concurrence concluded that, 
under the liberal construction standard, Tominiko’s OVUII charge was sufficient to charge a crime. Id. at 7. 
With respect to Tominiko’s motion to suppress, the
 
concurrence would have held that Tominiko was seized at the
 initial stop and Officer Stuart did not have reasonable suspicion
 to stop or detain him at that point. Id. at 7-8. The
 
concurrence would have held that no fruit came of Officer
 Stuart’s illegal search because Tominiko did not comply with his
 request to get out of the car. Id. at 8.
 
The concurrence observed that it wasn’t until after
 
Tominiko traveled a short distance and he was forced to stop by
 
13
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
an oncoming car that Officer Stuart noticed beer bottles in the
 
back of his car. Id. The concurring opinion would have held
 
that this “observation gave Officer Stuart probable cause to
 believe that Tominiko had an open container of intoxicating
 liquor in his car, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 § 291-3.3 (2007).” Id. It would have also held that Officer
 
Stuart’s search was lawful because he “acquired probable cause to
 seize Tominiko based on evidence obtained independent of his
 initial unlawful (unsuccessful) seizure” and would have affirmed
 the district court’s December 1, 2008, judgment. Id.
 
3. Dissenting opinion
 The dissenting opinion would have vacated and remanded 
the case for dismissal without prejudice because the charge was defective under State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai' i 383, 219 P.3d 1170 
(2009) and the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case. Tominiko, dissenting op. at 1 (Fujise, J., 
dissenting) (citing State v. Cummings, 101 Hawai' i 139, 145, 63 
P.3d 1109, 1115 (2003)). 
Tominiko subsequently applied for a writ of certiorari
 
to the ICA’s July 15, 2010 Judgment on Appeal filed pursuant to
 its June 30, 2010 Memorandum Opinion affirming the district
 
14
     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
court’s judgment filed on December 1, 2008.4
 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
A. Application For Writ Of Certiorari
 
The acceptance or rejection of an application for writ 
of certiorari is discretionary. HRS § 602-59(a) (Supp. 2010). 
“In deciding whether to accept an application, this court reviews the decisions of the ICA for (1) grave errors of law or of fact or (2) obvious inconsistencies in the decision of the ICA with that of the supreme court, federal decisions, or its own decisions and whether the magnitude of such errors or inconsistencies dictate the need for further appeal.” State v. 
Wheeler, 121 Hawai' i 383, 390, 219 P.3d 1170, 1177 (2009) (citing 
HRS § 602-59(b)). 
B. Sufficiency Of a Charge
 
“Whether an indictment sets forth all the essential 
elements of an offense to be charged is a question of law” 
reviewed under the right/wrong standard. State v. Wells, 78 
Hawai'i 373, 379, 894 P.2d 70, 76 (1995).

‘wrong.’” State v. Prendergast, 103 Hawai' i 451, 453, 83 P.3d 
714, 716 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting State 
v. Rodgers, 99 Hawai' i 70, 72, 53 P.3d 209, 211 (2002)). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
A.	 The OVUII Charge Was Not Insufficient Under the Liberal
Construction Standard.
 
Tominiko asserts that the ICA gravely erred because the
 
charge cannot be construed to charge an offense. In response,
 
the prosecution asserts that under the liberal construction
 standard, the charge was sufficient because the driving without
 insurance charge alleged that the incident took place “upon a
 public street, road, or highway of the State of Hawaii . . . .” 
We hold that the charging language was not insufficient under the
 liberal construction standard.
 
Neither party disputes that the liberal construction
 
standard applies. Under the liberal construction standard, when
 a party raises an objection to the indictment for the first time
 on appeal, the indictment is liberally construed. State v.
 
Motta, 66 Haw. 89, 90, 657 P.2d 1019, 1019 (1983). This standard
 “means we will not reverse a conviction based upon a defective
 indictment unless the defendant can show prejudice or that the
 indictment cannot within reason be construed to charge a crime.” 
Id. at 91, 657 P.2d at 1020. This court has also recognized that
 
16
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
one “way in which an otherwise deficient count can be reasonably 
construed to charge a crime is by examination of the charge as a whole.” State v. Elliot, 77 Hawai' i 309, 312, 884 P.2d 372, 375 
(1994) (citing State v. Schroeder, 76 Hawai' i 517, 530, 880 P.2d 
192, 205 (1994)). 
Applying the foregoing standard in this case, the
 
charge was not defective because Tominiko has not persuasively
 argued that he was prejudiced or that the charge failed to charge
 a crime. Tominiko does not assert that he was prejudiced, and
 therefore the critical question is whether the charge can be
 construed to charge a crime. As discussed below, it can.
 
Count 3 alleged that Tominiko “did operate or use a 
motor vehicle upon a public street, road, or highway of the State of Hawaii . . . .” Under the liberal construction standard, two counts can be read together. Elliot, 77 Hawai' i at 312, 884 P.2d 
at 375; State v. Sprattling, 99 Hawai' i 312, 319, 55 P.3d 276, 
283 (2002) (“[W]e now interpret a charge as a whole, employing practical considerations and common sense.”) (citing State v. Daly, 4 Haw. App. 52, 55, 659 P.2d 83, 85-86 (1983)). Although the OVUII charge did not allege that the conduct occurred on a public roadway, under the liberal construction standard, reading the third count with the first count renders the charge sufficient. See State v. Johnson, No. 28471 at 2-4 (Aug. 2, 
17
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
2010) (Recktenwald, J., dissenting). Because both charges refer 
to operating a motor vehicle on the same day in Honolulu, Hawai'i, it can be reasonably inferred that they refer to the 
same incident. Therefore, the charge was not defective. 
Tominiko asserts that this court has held that the 
operation of the vehicle on a public way, street, road, or 
highway is an essential element of the offense of OVUII. (Citing 
State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai' i 383, 393, 219 P.3d 1170, 1180 
(2009.)) In Wheeler, this court held that, where the defendant 
made a timely objection to an OVUII charge, the charge was insufficient because it failed to allege the public road element of the offense. Wheeler, 121 Hawai' i at 396, 219 P.3d at 1183. 
This argument is not persuasive because Wheeler did not apply the liberal construction standard and the defendant was not charged with a second count alleging the public road element. Id. at 
400, 219 P.3d at 1187 (“Thus, because Wheeler timely objected to the oral charge in the district court, the Motta/Wells analysis is not applicable here.”). This court also held that “we do not address whether the application of [the Motta/Wells] analysis would require a different result in the circumstances of this case, if the objection was not timely made.” Id. at n.19. 
Therefore, Wheeler does not indicate that the charge was insufficient in this case because the liberal construction 
18
           
            
             
           
              
             
            
              
              
        
             *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
standard did not apply in that case.
 
Finally, although the Driving Without Motor Vehicle 
Insurance charge was dismissed prior to trial, this does not 
affect our conclusion that the charge was not insufficient. Tominiko did not raise any argument concerning the dismissal of the Driving Without Motor Vehicle Insurance charge before the ICA. However, even assuming arguendo that Tominiko has preserved this argument, it is not persuasive. The district court’s dismissal of the third count did not alter the fact that both counts referred to the same incident, which occurred on a public roadway. Although the Driving Without Insurance charge was dismissed, the complaint, when read as a whole, apprised Tominiko that he was being charged for conduct that occurred on a public roadway. See Wheeler, 121 Hawai' i at 394, 219 P.3d at 1181 
(“This court’s analysis of charges under the Hawai' i constitution 
has focused on whether the language actually used in the charge provides fair notice to the defendant.”).
5 Therefore, the charge

III together because count III was dismissed prior to trial. Concurring and 
Dissenting Opinion at 14-18. The dissent argues that our prior cases on thisissue are not determinative because those cases involved counts that were not dismissed at trial. Id. (citing Elliot, 77 Hawai 'i at 312, 884 P.2d at 375; 
State v. Schroeder , 76 Hawai 'i 517, 529, 880 P.2d 192, 205 (1994)). However,
neither of those cases held that counts could only be construed together ifthey were not dismissed prior to trial. See Elliot , 77 Hawai 'i at 312, 884 
P.2d at 375; Schroeder , 76 Hawai 'i at 530, 880 P.2d at 205. Because the 
charging document, when liberally construed, provided Tominiko with noticethat he was being charged with conduct that occurred on a public roadway, the

was not insufficient when examining it as a whole.
 
B.	 Officer Stuart’s Seizure Of Tominiko Was Unconstititional 
and the ICA Gravely Erred By Affirming the District Court’s
Judgment.
 
The ICA gravely erred by affirming the district court’s
 
judgment because: 1) Officer Stuart did not have reasonable
 
suspicion at the time he seized Tominiko; and 2) the evidence
 Officer Stuart obtained was a result of his unlawful seizure.
 
1.	 Officer Stuart did not have reasonable suspicion to
stop Tominiko. 
Article I, section 7 of the Hawai' i Constitution and 
the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution provide the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. To determine whether a seizure is unconstitutional, this court determines: 1) whether the person was seized; and 2) whether the seizure was justified. State v. Dawson, 120 Hawai' i 363, 369, 
205 P.3d 628, 634 (App. 2009).
 
Neither party disputes the lead opinion’s conclusion
 
5...continue 
charge was sufficient.
Additionally, to the extent that the dissent asserts that Hawai 'i Rules 
of Penal Procedure Rule 7(d) requires explicit language incorporating elements
from one count into another, this argument is unpersuasive because it wasrejected in this court’s opinion in Schroeder . See Concurring and Dissenting
Opinion at 18 (citing State v. Schroeder , 10 Haw. App. 535, 545, 880 P.2d 208,
212-13 (App. 1992), aff’d on other grounds , Schroeder , 76 Hawai 'i at 532, 880 
P.2d at 207). In that opinion, this court held that a count could incorporatelanguage from another count, even though the charging document did not containlanguage specifically doing so in that case. See Schroeder , 76 Hawai 'i at 
518-19, 530, 880 P.2d at 193-94, 205.

that Tominiko was seized at the first stop. “[A] person is 
seized if, given the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable person would have believed that he or she was not free to leave.” State v. Kearns, 75 Haw. 558, 566, 867 P.2d 903, 907 (1994) (citing State v. Quino, 74 Haw. 161, 168-73, 840 P.2d 358, 362-64 (1992)). “Whether a reasonable person would feel free to leave is determined under an objective standard that this court reviews de novo.” Id. (citing State v. Tsukiyama, 56 Haw. 8, 12, 525 
P.2d 1099, 1102 (1974)). A “person is seized, for purposes of article I, section 7 of the Hawai' i Constitution, when a police 
officer approaches that person for the express or implied purpose of investigating him or her for possible criminal violations and begins to ask for information.” Id. at 567, 867 P.2d at 907. 
In this case, Officer Stuart told Tominiko to exit his
 
car. At a minimum, a reasonable person would not have felt free
 to leave when Officer Stuart asked Tominiko to exit his car,
 which is also demonstrated by Officer Stuart’s subsequent chasing
 of Tominiko. Thus, Tominiko was seized when Officer Stuart told
 him to exit the vehicle.
 
This stop was not supported by reasonable suspicion. 
This court has held that “the police may temporarily detain an
 individual if they have a reasonable suspicion based on specific
 and articulable facts that criminal activity is afoot.” Kearns,

75 Haw. at 569, 867 P.2d at 908 (citing State v. Melear, 63 Haw.
 
488, 493, 630 P.2d 619, 624 (1981)). This court has adhered to
 the following standard for reasonable suspicion:
 
To justify an investigative stop, short of an arrest
based on probable cause, “the police officer must be able to
point to specific and articulable facts which, taken
together with rational inferences from those facts,
reasonably warrant that intrusion.” The ultimate test in
 
these situations must be whether from these facts, measured
by an objective standard, a man of reasonable caution would
be warranted in believing that criminal activity was afoot
and that the action taken was appropriate . (Citations
omitted.)
 
Melear, 63 Haw. at 493, 630 P.2d at 624 (emphasis added) (quoting
 
State v. Barnes, 58 Haw. 333, 338, 568 P.2d 1207, 1211 (1977)). 
This court evaluates the totality of the circumstances 
to determine whether a stop is supported by reasonable suspicion. State v. Spillner, 116 Hawai' i 351, 357, 173 P.3d 498, 504 
(2007). 
Tominiko asserts that the lead opinion gravely erred by
 
concluding that the initial stop was supported by reasonable
 suspicion because: 1) the anonymous tip “lacked sufficient
 indicia of reliability to provide reasonable suspicion to make an
 investigatory stop of Tominiko[;]” 2) the fact that Tominiko
 attempted to avoid confrontation with the police did not create
 reasonable suspicion; and 3) “the evidence used to convict
 Tominiko of OVUII, including evidence of empty beer bottles, was
 fruit or tainted evidence obtained as a result of Officer

Stuart’s illegal seizure of Tominiko[.]” In response, the
 
prosecution asserts that “[g]iven the reports received by Officer
 Stuart of a fairly large group arguing at about midnight and
 Officer Stuart’s own observation of alcoholic consumption by
 members of the group and the Petitioner and other members of the
 group’s sudden dispersal upon Officer Stuart’s arrival, Officer
 Stuart’s initial suspicion that Petitioner and other members of
 the group were drinking alcohol in public in violation of Revised
 Ordinances of Honolulu (ROH) 40-1.2(a) (2008) and/or that members
 of the group may have been fighting or making unreasonable noise
 in violation of HRS § 711-1101(a) or (b) (2008 Supp.) was not
 
objectively unreasonable.” (Emphasis omitted.)
 
We hold that Officer Stuart did not have reasonable 
suspicion to seize Tominiko because Officer Stuart did not have 
evidence that Tominiko, rather than other members of his group, had committed or was about commit a crime. Hawai' i courts have 
held that “[b]ased upon all the circumstances, the detaining officers must have a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity.” State v. Koanui, 3 Haw. App. 255, 258, 649 P.2d 385, 387 (App. 1982) (emphasis added) (citing United States v. Cortez, 449 U.S. 411, 417 (1981)); State v. Uddipa, 3 Haw. App. 415, 418, 651 P.2d 507, 510 (App. 1982) (stating that reasonable suspicion requires 
23
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
“that the particular individual being stopped is engaged in
 
wrongdoing”) (internal quotation marks omitted). Additionally,
 the United States Supreme Court has also required reasonable
 suspicion that the person stopped was involved in criminal
 activity. Cortez, 449 U.S. at 417-18 (citing Brown v. Texas, 443
 
U.S. 47, 51 (1979); United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S.
 873, 884 (1975)). Under both federal and state law, Officer
 Stuart needed reasonable suspicion that Tominiko was involved in
 criminal conduct.
 
Officer Stuart did not have a reasonable suspicion that
 
Tominiko was engaged in criminal activity. Officer Stuart
 admitted that he did not recall seeing Tominiko drinking beer or
 holding a beer bottle in his hand when he approached the group. 
Additionally, Officer Stuart did not see Tominiko fighting or
 talking loud. Although a call reporting an argument was made,
 Officer Stuart could not determine if the group was arguing, and
 did not see Tominiko or anyone in the group fighting.
 
Other courts have held that there is no reasonable
 
suspicion to stop an individual in similar situations. For
 instance, in United States v. Williams, the Sixth Circuit held
 that a police officer did not have reasonable suspicion to stop
 the defendant when people in the defendant’s group were drinking
 in public and allegedly trespassing on private property. 615
 
24
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
F.3d 657, 667 (6th Cir. 2010). The court held that “the argument
 
for reasonable suspicion based on others’ drinking and presence
 on [the] property is weak in light of the Supreme Court’s
 emphasis on ‘individualized suspicion of wrongdoing.’” Id.
 
(quoting Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 313 (1997)); see also
 State v. Regnier, 212 P.3d 1269, 1274 (Or. App. 2009) (holding
 that police officers did not have reasonable suspicion that the
 defendants possessed alcohol in public when members of their
 group were drinking). Likewise, because Officer Stuart did not
 observe Tominiko drinking, arguing, fighting, or making
 unreasonable amounts of noise, he did not have reasonable
 suspicion that Tominiko committed a crime.
 
The call regarding fifteen people arguing also does not
 
provide reasonable suspicion to stop Tominiko. “A forcible stop
 of a person suspected of criminal activity may . . . be
 predicated upon an informer’s word, provided the information
 carries ‘enough indicia of reliability.’” State v. Temple, 65
 
Haw. 261, 270, 650 P.2d 1358, 1364 (1982) (quoting Adams v.
 Williams, 407 U.S. 143 (1972)). This court has analyzed whether
 the circumstances of the stop corroborate a tip in assessing its
 reliability. See State v. Ward, 62 Haw. 459, 461-62, 617 P.2d
 
565, 566-67 (1980) (holding that a tip was sufficiently reliable
 to create reasonable suspicion where the informant had provided
 
25
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
reliable information in the past, the substance of the tip was
 
very specific, and the officers’ observations coincided in
 verifiable respects with their informant’s tip). Officer
 Stuart’s observations did not confirm the substance of the tip,
 which asserted that the group was arguing. For instance, Officer
 Stuart testified that the group was having a social gathering. 
He testified that some people were talking loudly, but he could
 not discern whether the group was arguing. Furthermore, the call
 provided no information that Tominiko had argued or fought. 
Therefore, the tip was not reliable because Officer Stuart’s
 observations did not confirm it.
 
Additionally, the call to dispatch did not indicate 
that Tominiko had engaged in any illegal activity. The call did not single out Tominiko and did not allege that any illegal conduct took place. Because the central inquiry of the legality of an investigatory stop is whether there is a reasonable suspicion that a person was involved in illegal conduct, the call could not have provided reasonable suspicion to stop Tominiko. See State v. Heapy, 113 Hawai' i 283, 285, 151 P.3d 764, 766 
(2007) (“It is axiomatic that reasonable suspicion to justify a stop must relate to criminal activity.”); Koanui, 3 Haw. App. at 257-58, 649 P.2d at 387. 
Finally, Tominiko’s walk to his car does not
 
26
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
demonstrate reasonable suspicion that he committed a crime. 
“[T]he majority of jurisdictions which have addressed the issue of flight have held that the mere act of avoiding confrontation does not create an articulable suspicion.” Heapy, 113 Hawai' i at 
294, 151 P.3d at 775 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting State v. Talbot, 792 P.2d 489, 493-94 (Utah Ct. App. 1990)). This court has held that flight from police can support a finding of probable cause. State v. Melear, 63 Haw. 488, 494-95, 630 
P.2d 619, 625 (1981). In this case, the flight was not as inculpatory as in Malear. For instance, in Malear, the defendant ran away after the police asked him to stop and show identification. Id. In this case, Tominiko mumbled something, 
walked to his car, and attempted to start it. Officer Stuart testified that Tominiko was the only person in the crowd that did not leave in a hurry. Tominiko’s walking to his car did not raise reasonable suspicion that he committed a crime. 
Additionally, the lead opinion held that Tominiko’s
 
flight, in conjunction with the other circumstances, created
 reasonable suspicion. Tominiko, mem. op. at 13. However, this
 
argument is not persuasive because the other circumstances did
 not provide a reasonable suspicion that Tominiko had committed a
 crime. See supra at 23-27. Thus, the lead opinion gravely erred
 
by holding that Officer Stuart had reasonable suspicion that
 
27
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
Tominiko was engaged in criminal conduct.
 
2.	 The ICA gravely erred because the evidence obtained was
the result of Officer Stuart’s unconstitutional 
seizure.
 
The lead opinion also held that “even if there was an
 
improper seizure at the point Officer Stuart asked Tominiko to
 exit or to stop his car, there were no fruits from such seizure.” 
Tominiko, mem. op. at 13. It observed that another vehicle
 stopped Tominiko’s car and that Officer Stuart then saw the beer
 bottles in Tominko’s car. Id. The concurrence also would have
 
held that there were no fruits or tainted evidence obtained from
 Officer Stuart’s initial seizure of Tominiko because Tominiko
 drove off after being stopped by Officer Stuart, and was later
 stopped by another vehicle. Tominiko, concurring op. at 8. The
 
concurring opinion would have held that Officer Stuart gained
 probable cause to believe that Tominiko had an open container in
 his car in violation of HRS § 291-3.3 (2007) after observing beer
 bottles in Tominiko’s car. Id.
 
Tominiko asserts that the lead opinion and concurring
 
opinion gravely erred because the evidence obtained by Officer
 Stuart was tainted evidence. Tominiko asserts that the
 concurring opinion adopts a test for “seizure” that this court
 rejected in State v. Quino, 74 Haw. 161, 170, 840 P.2d 358, 362
 (1992) (“[W]e decline to adopt the definition of seizure employed
 
28
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
by the United States Supreme Court in Hodari D.[, 499 U.S. 621, 
625 (1991)] and, instead, choose to afford greater protection to our citizens by maintaining the Mendenhall standard.”). In 
Quino
, this court described the United States Supreme Court’s 
definition of “seizure” in Hodari D. as requiring “either physical force or submission to an assertion of authority.” Quino, 74 Haw. at 169-70, 840 P.2d at 362. This court rejected the Hodari D. standard, and continued to adhere to the following standard to offer greater protection under article I, section 7 of the Hawai' i Constitution: “we must evaluate the totality of 
the circumstances and decide whether or not a reasonably prudent person would believe he was free to go.” Id. at 170, 840 P.2d at 
362 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting State v. Tsukiyama, 56 Haw. 8, 12, 525 P.2d 1099, 1102 (1974)). We hold that the evidence obtained was the result of an illegal seizure because: 1) Officer Stuart’s stop was a single illegal seizure; and 2) even viewing the incident as two separate seizures, the evidence recovered after the second seizure was the fruit of the first illegal seizure. 
The ICA gravely erred because Officer Stuart’s stop was
 
a single illegal seizure. This court rejected Hodari D.’s
 holding that a seizure requires “either physical force or
 submission to an assertion of authority.” Id. at 169-70, 840
 
29
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
P.2d at 362. Furthermore, some courts that have rejected Hodari
 
D. have also concluded that pursuit of a person can constitute a
 seizure. For instance, in Commonwealth v. Matos, the
 Pennsylvania Supreme Court noted that the “issue in each of these
 cases is whether the pursuit by the police officer was a seizure”
 and held that it was. 672 A.2d 769, 771, 776 (Pa. 1996); see
 also Commonwealth v. Thibeau, 429 N.E.2d 1009, 1010 (Mass. 1981)
 (“For present purposes, a stop starts when pursuit begins.”). 
Although this court has not held that a person is continually
 seized upon fleeing from police, this court’s rejection of Hodari
 D. supports that conclusion. If a seizure occurs when police officers start to chase a person, a seizure continues when the person runs after disobeying a command to stop. Thus, Officer Stuart’s encounter with Tominiko was a single seizure. Officer Stuart’s continuing attempt to improperly seize Tominiko placed the officer in the position from which he could observe the bottles in Tominiko’s car. State v. Poaipuni, 98 Hawai' i 387, 
393, 49 P.3d 353, 359 (2002) (“Assuming, arguendo, that [the defendant’s] father[] voluntarily informed the police that the [contraband was] located in the tool shed and, moreover, voluntarily consented to the search of the tool shed, the police still would not have been in a position to learn of the firearms or to discover them in the tool shed had not they executed the

           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
defective search warrant.”).6 Therefore, the circuit court erred
 
by failing to suppress the evidence recovered as a result of that
 
seizure.
 
Alternatively, the evidence obtained after the second
 
stop is fruit of the poisonous tree because it was obtained as a
 result of the first illegal stop. This court has held that the
 “fruit of the poisonous tree” doctrine “prohibits the use of
 evidence at trial which comes to light as a result of the
 exploitation of a previous illegal act of the police.” State v.
 
Fukusaku, 85 Hawai' i 462, 475, 946 P.2d 32, 45 (1997) (internal 
quotation marks omitted) (quoting State v. Medeiros, 4 Haw. App.
 248, 251 n.4, 665 P.2d 181, 184 n.4 (1983)). To determine
 whether evidence is tainted from an illegal search, this court
 has adhered to the following standard:
 
Admissibility is determined by ascertaining whether
the evidence objected to as being the ‘fruit’ was discovered
 
or became known by the exploitation of the prior illegality
or by other means sufficiently distinguished as to purge the
later evidence of the initial taint . Wong Sun v. United
States, 371 U.S. 471, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963).
Where the government proves that the evidence was discovered
through information from an independent source or where the
connection between the illegal acts and the discovery of the
evidence is so attenuated that the taint has been
 dissipated, the evidence is not a “fruit” and, therefore, is
 admissible. Wong Sun v. United States , supra.
 
Id. (emphasis added).
 
6 The situation in the instant case is distinguishable from one
 
where a police officer attempts to improperly seize a person but observes
contraband which the officer would have observed regardless of the attempt to
seize.
 
31
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
This court has also stated that in “other words, the 
ultimate question that the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine 
poses is as follows: Disregarding the prior illegality, would the police nevertheless have discovered the evidence?” Poaipuni, 
98 Hawai' i at 393, 49 P.3d at 359. 
Under the foregoing standard, the ICA gravely erred by
 
concluding that the evidence obtained after Officer Stuart’s
 seizure of Tominiko was not fruit of the poisonous tree because
 the evidence was obtained as a result of Officer Stuart’s illegal
 seizure of Tominiko. Officer Stuart did not have reasonable
 suspicion to stop Tominiko, and after catching up to Tominiko, he
 
discovered probable cause to arrest Tominiko. The evidence
 
obtained after the initial stop is fruit of the poisonous tree
 
because it was discovered by exploiting Officer Stuart’s prior
 illegal seizure.
 
This court reached a similar conclusion in Quino, 74
 
Haw. at 168, 840 P.2d at 362. In Quino, the defendant was
 stopped after arriving at an airport. Id. at 165, 840 P.2d at
 
360. Police officers requested to pat the defendant down, and
 
the defendant fled. Id. at 166, 840 P.2d at 361. During the
 
chase, the defendant discarded drugs. Id. This court held that
 
the defendant was unlawfully seized by the police officers’
 interrogation and that the evidence obtained after the defendant

fled was inadmissible as the product of an illegal seizure. Id.
 
at 168, 840 P.2d at 361-62. This court also held that it was
 
unnecessary to decide whether the defendant was “seized” when the
 police officers pursued him as he ran through the airport
 terminal. Id. at 163 n.1, 840 P.2d at 359 n.1. As in Quino, the
 
evidence in this case was the product of an illegal seizure
 because it came to light when Officer Stuart caught up with
 Tominiko after the initial unlawful stop.
 
Quino is factually distinguishable because the drugs in
 
Quino were thrown while the police officers chased the defendant,
 while in this case, Officer Stuart caught up with Tominiko and
 then acquired probable cause to arrest Tominiko upon observing
 the bottles in his car. This distinction does not suggest that
 the evidence is not the product of an illegal seizure because
 Officer Stuart’s observations resulted from his continued pursuit
 in an attempt to force Tominiko to comply with his unlawful
 seizure. Therefore, the evidence used to convict Tominiko was
 fruit of the poisonous tree.
