ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION 
(
By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
On August 18, 2014, Petitioner/Plaintiff/Cross-
Defendant/Appellant Hirokazu Nakajima (Hirokazu) filed a Motion
 
for Reconsideration of this court’s August 7, 2014 order
 accepting his application for a writ of certiorari and remanding
 the case to the Intermediate Court of Appeals for further
 proceedings.
1 In his motion, Hirokazu argues that this court
 
1 Because this court’s August 7, 2014 order was a dispositional order and
 
not merely an order accepting an application for a writ of certiorari, Hawai 'i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 40.1(h) does not apply.  In such
 
circumstances, this court’s appellate jurisdiction covers the ten-day time
period in which a party may file a motion for reconsideration.  
See HRAP Rule
 
40(a).    
  misconstrued the scope of the sanctions that the Family Court of
 
the Second Circuit imposed for abuse of the discovery process. 
He asserts that those sanctions did not extend to the denial of
 an evidentiary hearing regarding the valuation of Avalon Cove,
 Inc. Hirokazu’s argument is meritless. The family court
 specifically concluded “that there was no due process violation
 in determining the appraised value of the Avalon Cove properties
 without an evidentiary hearing because its ruling . . . reflects
 sanctions against Hirokazu for concealing assets.” See Record on
 
Appeal at 1253 (some capitalization omitted). The record
 confirms that the family court’s sanctions included denying
 Hirokazu an evidentiary hearing. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion for 
reconsideration is denied.
