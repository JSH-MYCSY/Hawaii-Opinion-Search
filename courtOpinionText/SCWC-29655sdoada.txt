SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ; with Recktenwald, C.J.,
dissenting, with whom Nakayama, J., joins)
 
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant Francis M. Shyanguya
 
(Petitioner) seeks review of the August 24, 2012 judgment of the
 
Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) filed pursuant to its June
 25, 2012 Memorandum Opinion (Memo. op.), affirming the Judgment
 entered on February 2, 2009 by the District Court of the First
 
1
Circuit (the court  ).  Petitioner was convicted by the court of 
Prostitution in violation of the Hawai
'i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 
1
 The Honorable Russel S. Nagata presided.

712-1200 (1)(1993).2 On appeal to the ICA, Petitioner contended
 
(1) that the trial counsel was ineffective because of 
“incompetent and damaging direct and cross examination and closing arguments,” and (2) the oral charge was deficient because it “fail[ed] to state the specific sexual conduct” and, “[u]nder State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai' i 383, 219 P.3d 1170 [(2009)] fair 
notice to the defendant requires notice of the means of terms of elements that are not readily comprehensible to persons of common understanding.”
3 The ICA sua sponte raised the issue of whether 
the charge contained a jurisdictional defect for failing to allege the requisite mens rea, citing State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai'i 48, 56, 276 P.3d 617, 625 (2012), in which this court held 
that a charge that fails to allege the requisite state of mind does not provide fair notice to the accused of the nature and cause of the accusation.

 At the time of the charge, HRS § 712-1200(1) (1993) provided:
 
(1) a person commits the offense of prostitution if the person
engages in, or agrees or offers to engage in, sexual conduct with
another person for a fee.
 
HRS § 712-1200(1).
 
3
 The charge stated as follows:
 
On or about the 16th day of September, 2008, in the City and
County of Honolulu, State of Hawai 'i, [Petitioner] did
engage in, or agree or offer to engage in, sexual conductwith another person for a fee, thereby committed the offenseof Prostitution, in violation of Section 712-1200(1) of theHawai'i Revised Statutes.

   ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
In his Application, Petitioner contends that a charge 
which does not plead the “essential fact[]” of mens rea “amounts 
to a failure to state an offense,” (citing State v. Cummings, 101 Hawai'i 139, 142, 63 P. 3d 1109, 112 (2003)), and that “[a]ny 
conviction based on such defective complaint cannot be sustained.” (Citing Nesmith, 127 Hawai' i at 62 276 P. 3d at 630 
(Acoba, J., concurring and dissenting).). The ICA, inter alia, held that Petitioner “waived any challenge to the sufficiency of the charge for failure to allege a mens rea by not objecting on this basis in [the court] and by not asserting this claim on appeal.” State v. Shyanguya, No. 29655, 2012 WL 2383726, at *4 
(App. June 25, 2012). 
HRS § 712-1200(1) does not specify the state of mind
 
required to establish the elements of the offense of
 prostitution. Thus, under HRS § 702-204 (1993), for each element
 of HRS § 712-1200(1), the state must establish that Petitioner
 acted intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly.

In State v. Maharaj, No. SCWC-29520, 2013 WL 6068086,
 
at *5 (Haw. Nov. 18, 2013), where the issue of mens rea was
 raised for the first time on appeal, we reaffirmed the “core
 
4
 HRS § 702-204 (1993) provides, “When the state of mind required to
 
establish an element of an offense is not specified by the law, that element
is established if, with respect thereto, a person acts intentionally,
knowingly, or recklessly.”

principle” set out in State v. Apollonio, 130 Hawai' i 353, 311 
P.3d 676 (2013), that “‘[a] charge that fails to charge a 
requisite state of mind cannot be construed reasonabl[y] to state an offense and thus the charge is dismissed without prejudice because it violates due process.’”
5 Id. (quoting Apollonio, 130 
Hawai'i at 359, 311 P.3d at 682). We also held that “as a fact 
that must be alleged in a charge, a requisite state of mind is clearly an essential fact that must be alleged under [Hawai' i 
Rules of Penal Procedure] Rule 7(d).” Id. at *5 (internal 
quotation marks omitted). Thus, inasmuch as the Complaint against Petitioner failed to allege the requisite state of mind that also was an essential fact of the offense of prostitution, the Complaint must be dismissed without prejudice. Id. at *5. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the August 24, 2012 judgment
 
of the ICA and the February 2, 2009 Judgment of the court are
 vacated, and this case is remanded to the court with instructions
 to dismiss the Complaint without prejudice.
