OPINION OF THE COURT BY MCKENNA, J.
 
I. Introduction
 At issue in this appeal is whether Petitioner/Defendant-
Appellant Henry Pomroy (“Pomroy”) was adequately informed of his
 right to testify. 
Pomroy presents the following questions on
 
certiorari: 
A. Whether the Intermediate Court of Appeals determined in
error that the district court’s failure to advise petitioner
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
prior to start of trial of his right to testify did not
warrant reversal of the trial court’s judgment of
conviction.
 B. 
Whether the Intermediate Court of Appeals determined in
]
 colloquy was
 Tachibana  [1error that the district court’s not defective and petitioner’s waiver of right to testify
was valid.
 
C. Whether the Intermediate Court of Appeals should have
rejected the trial court’s finding that the testimony of the
2

 complaining witness was credible .
We hold that the district court’s right-to-testify colloquy was
 
defective. As a result, the district court did not obtain an on­the-record waiver of the right to testify from Pomroy. Pomroy
 has thus proven a constitutional violation of his right to
 testify, and under the circumstances of this case, such violation
 cannot be considered harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. We
 further hold that the prohibition against double jeopardy does
 not preclude a retrial in this case, as substantial evidence
 supported Pomroy’s conviction.
 
1 Referring to State v. Tachibana, 79 Hawai' i 226, 236, 900 P.2d 1293, 
1303 (1995), which held, “[I]n order to protect the right to testify under the
Hawai’i Constitution, trial courts must advise criminal defendants of their 
right to testify and must obtain an on-the-record waiver of that right in
every case in which the defendant does not testify.” (Footnotes omitted).This court stated that “the ideal time to conduct the colloquy is immediately 
prior to the close of the defendant’s case.” 79 Hawai' i at 237, 900 P.2d at 
1304. 
2 Although not specifically raised as a question, Pomroy’s certiorari
application also asserts that the Intermediate Court of Appeals erred in
concluding there was substantial evidence to support his conviction.
Therefore, we address this issue on certiorari. Based on our decision to
 vacate the conviction and remand for a new trial, however, we need not and do
 not address Question C.

II. Background
 
A. Trial
 
Pomroy was charged by Complaint with “intentionally, 
knowingly or recklessly caus[ing] bodily injury to another person, CLARK LUKENS, thereby committing the offense of Assault in the Third Degree, in violation of Section 707-712(1)(a), 
Hawai'i Revised Statutes, as amended.”
3 He waived his right to a 
trial by jury. 
4
At the bench trial,  the district court did not conduct a
Tachibana
 colloquy with Pomroy prior to the start of trial. The
 
State called as its first witness Clark Lukens, the complaining
 
witness. Lukens testified that he has required the use of
 crutches since 1987 due to hip dysplasia. Lukens testified that
 Pomroy was a fellow tenant at the Hale Moana Apartment Complex in
 Hilo. As to the assault in question, Lukens testified that while
 he was in the backyard with a landscaper and a board member of
 the apartment complex, Pomroy approached “screaming,” in an
 “extremely aggravated and aggressive” manner. Pomroy bumped his
 
3 Hawai'i Revised Statutes (“HRS”) 707-712(1)(a) (1993) provides, “A
person commits the offense of assault in the third degree if the person . . .
[i]ntentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes bodily injury to anotherperson. . . .” HRS § 707-700 (1993) defines “bodily injury” as “physicalpain, illness, or any impairment of physical condition.”
4 The Honorable Barbara T. Takase presided.
 
3
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
chest against Lukens and accused Lukens of attempting to have
 
Pomroy evicted from the apartment complex. 
The interaction lasted five minutes, then Pomroy left, so 
Lukens decided to enter the elevator to return to his (Lukens’)
 apartment. Lukens testified that after he entered the empty
 elevator, Pomroy suddenly appeared and forced himself into the
 elevator, and the door closed behind him, leaving Lukens alone in
 the elevator with Pomroy. During the entire ride to the seventh
 floor, Pomroy, who had pushed Lukens into the corner of the
 elevator, used his forearms and elbows to strike Lukens about 50
 or 60 times in the throat, neck, and shoulders. Lukens recalled
 Pomroy saying “he [Pomroy] was gonna kick [Lukens’] ass, he was
 gonna beat the F’n shit outta [Lukens], he was gonna teach
 [Lukens] manners.” When the elevator doors opened on the seventh
 floor, Pomroy “ceased the attack” and “immediately sprung back
 off” of Lukens. Lukens’ wife was waiting for him at the elevator
 landing on the seventh floor and helped Lukens out. Lukens
 testified that he felt pain, which he described as a seven or
 eight on a ten-point scale, because Pomroy was a “big guy” who
 was hitting “with all his might,” “trying to hurt [Lukens],” and
 hitting “[a]s hard as he could.” Lukens also testified he had no
 injuries from that day.
 
4
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The State then called Lukens’ wife, Paulette Berbelis, who
 
testified that she had been waiting outside the elevator on the
 
seventh floor for Lukens after the landscaper had called her to
 ask if Lukens was okay. Berbelis heard Pomroy screaming and
 yelling inside the elevator. As the elevator doors opened,
 Berbelis saw Pomroy “jump away” from Lukens, while Lukens was
 “pushed against” against the elevator wall. Berbelis observed
 Pomroy to be “hepped up” or “aggressive,” while Lukens appeared
 “[s]haken up quite a bit.” Lukens complained to her of pain in
 his chest and neck. 
The State then called landscaper Robert Robbins, who
 
testified that Pomroy had been upset and yelling in the backyard
 about people cutting down trees. Lukens then approached Robbins
 and Pomroy and told Pomroy to leave Robbins alone. At that
 point, Pomroy and Lukens continued their conversation, with
 Pomroy still angry, and Lukens keeping his distance. Robbins
 then saw both head toward the foyer (where the elevator is
 located) and heard “excessive banging” coming from the elevator
 shaft, which he thought was “[n]othing human. Just mechanical.” 
The State then called Hawai' i County Police Department 
police officer Jeremy Kubojiri, who testified that he interviewed Lukens after the altercation. Kubojiri said Lukens was “shaken 
5
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
up” and complaining of pain in his chest. Kubojiri observed no
 
“visible injuries” to Lukens, and Lukens refused medical
 assistance. 
The State then called Hawai
'i County Police Department 
police officer Malia Bohol, who testified that she interviewed Pomroy after the altercation. Bohol testified that Pomroy told her that both he and Lukens approached Robbins, who was cutting down a tree with a chainsaw and leaving the debris in a pond. Lukens was yelling at an unknown person to turn off the chainsaw. Pomroy rode with Lukens in the elevator but did not “put his hands on Mr. Lukens in any way.” Rather, Lukens told Pomroy, “Make your move.” Pomroy exited the elevator and assisted a woman who had gotten locked out of her apartment. 
The State then rested its case. Immediately thereafter, 
defense counsel stated, “We’ll rest too, Your Honor.” At that point, the district court and Pomroy engaged in the following colloquy: 
THE COURT: Alright. Mr. Pomroy, before your attorney
[rests the defense’s case], let me advise you. You have the right to testify on your own behalf. That decision is yoursand yours alone. If you choose to testify you will besubject to cross-examination by the state. If you choosenot to testify, I cannot hold that against you. But the only evidence I will have is what the State has presented,unless you have other witnesses; you understand that?THE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma’am. 
THE COURT: Alright. Is it your choice to testify or not? 
6
  
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
THE DEFENDANT: I think I have already said what has
happened, yeah. I don’t have to testify.
THE COURT: Alright. I don’t know what you mean by “I’ve
already said” because -­THE DEFENDANT: In my report, when I made it two years ago,
what had happened. That’s pretty much what it is.
THE COURT: So you’re talking about what the officer
testified to? Because you understand the police report is
not in evidence. You understand that?
 THE DEFENDANT: I don’t understand what you’re saying.
(Discussion between Counsel and Defendant)
THE COURT: Alright.
THE DEFENDANT: I don’t need any testimony I guess.
THE COURT: Your choice not to testify?
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma’am.
 
The defense then rested.
 
The district court heard closing arguments then specifically
 
found Lukens’ testimony to be credible and corroborated by
 
Berbelis’ testimony. The district court stated there was no
 other credible evidence contradicting Lukens’ and Berbelis’
 testimony. The district court did find bodily injury and stated
 it was not necessary for the State to show Lukens suffered from
 bruises or redness or that he required medical attention. The
 district court therefore found that the State had proven its case
 beyond a reasonable doubt.
 
Pomroy filed a Motion for New Trial. He argued that the
 
district court failed to advise him of his right to testify
 before the start of trial. He also argued that, although the
 district court advised him of his right to testify immediately
 prior to the close of the defense’s case, it did not question him
 
7
  
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
enough to ensure that he adequately understood the decision not
 
to testify. 
The State opposed the Motion for New Trial, arguing that the
 
trial transcript “indicate[d Pomroy] was informed of his right to
 testify or not to testify,” Pomroy had a discussion with counsel
 after being informed of his rights, and Pomroy then elected not
 to testify after being informed of his rights.
 
The district court denied the Motion for New Trial and filed
 
its Judgment of Conviction and Sentence, which found Pomroy
 guilty as charged and sentenced him to a year of probation,
 imprisonment of 180 days (with 90 days stayed), a $55 Crime
 Victim Compensation Fund fine, and a $75 Probation Fee. Pomroy
 timely appealed.
 
B. Appeal 
Before the ICA, Pomroy first argued that his conviction was
 
supported by insufficient evidence. He argued that Lukens’
 testimony of being struck repeatedly about the neck, chest, and
 shoulders was contradicted by other testimony that there was no
 evidence of injury and no request for medical attention. Pomroy
 argued that Lukens was, therefore, not credible.
 
Pomroy next argued (1) that the district court did not
 
inform him of his right to testify prior to trial; and (2) at the
 
8
  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
close of the State’s case, when the district court informed
 
Pomroy of his right to testify, the district court “failed to
 ensure that Mr. Pomroy adequately understood his right to testify
 and the possible consequences of his decision not to testify,”
 given the “tentative nature of Mr. Pomroy’s responses and his
 continuing apparent mistaken belief that the Court had received
 sufficient evidence from his side. . . .” Pomroy argued that if
 the State was unable to show that the inadequate Tachibana
 colloquy was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, then Pomroy’s
 conviction must be vacated.
 
2. The State’s Answering Brief
 
In its Answering Brief, the State responded only to Pomroy’s 
second point of error. The State conceded that the district court did not conduct a prior-to-trial Tachibana colloquy with Pomroy, which is contrary to the mandate in State v. Lewis, 94 
Hawai'i 292, 297, 12 P.3d 1233, 1238 (2000): 
[T]rial courts ‘prior to the start of trial, [shall] (1)
inform the defendant of his or her personal right to testify
or not to testify and (2) alert the defendant that, if he or
she has not testified by the end of the trial, the court
will briefly question him or her to ensure that the decision
not to testify is the defendant’s own decision.
 
(Footnote omitted). The State further conceded that it could not
 
“make a good faith argument that the error committed by the trial
 court . . . was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.” To the
 
9
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
State, under the totality of the circumstances existing at trial,
 
where the only evidence before the district court had come from
 the State, had the district court complied with Lewis and advised
 Pomroy of his right to testify prior to trial, Pomroy might have
 testified and might have presented evidence establishing
 reasonable doubt that he committed assault. The State concluded
 with a request that the ICA reverse Pomroy’s conviction. Pomroy
 did not file a Reply Brief.
 
3. The ICA’s Memorandum Opinion
 
5
The ICA  rejected Pomroy’s points of error and affirmed his
conviction. State v. Pomroy
, No. 29688 (App. Dec. 26, 2012)(mem.
 
op.) at 9, 11, 12, 14. As to Pomroy’s first point of error (that
 insufficient evidence supported his conviction), the ICA held (1)
 that it was within the district court’s province to determine
 that Lukens’ testimony was credible; and (2) that the evidence,
 when viewed in the light most favorable to the State, showed that
 Lukens suffered physical pain, which constitutes “bodily injury”
 for the purpose of proving assault in the third degree in
 violation of HRS § 707-712(1)(a); evidence of bruising, redness,
 or other marks on Lukens’ body was not required. Pomroy, mem.
 
op. at 11-12.
 
The ICA panel consisted of Chief Judge Craig H. Nakamura and Associate
Judges Daniel R. Foley and Alexa D. M. Fujise. 
10
 5  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
As to the first part of Pomroy’s second point of error (that
 
the district court failed to advise Pomroy of his right to
 
testify prior to trial), the ICA first set aside the State’s
 concession of error as “not well taken.” Pomroy, mem. op. at 10
 
n.5. The ICA reasoned, “The State applied a harmless beyond a
 
reasonable doubt standard of review [to the Lewis error], whereas
 the correct standard requires Pomroy to demonstrate actual
 prejudice.” Id. Although the ICA recognized that the district
 
court failed to engage Pomroy in the prior-to-trial Tachibana
 colloquy, it held that Pomroy had not shown actual prejudice. 
Pomroy, mem. op. at 10. 
As to the second part of Pomroy’s second point of error
 
(that the district court failed to ensure that Pomroy’s waiver of
 his right to testify was intelligent, knowing and voluntary
 during the colloquy conducted immediately prior to the close of
 Pomroy’s case), the ICA held that (1) the district court fully
 advised Pomroy of his right to testify, and (2) “[a]ny confusion
 held by Pomroy over the evidentiary difference between the
 officer’s trial testimony regarding Pomroy’s statement and the
 police report was for Pomroy’s counsel to explain, and the record
 indicates that Pomroy’s counsel did discuss this issue with
 Pomroy.” Pomroy, mem. op at 9, 10. 
11
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
III. Discussion
 
On certiorari, Pomroy argues that the ICA erred (1) in
 
determining that the district court’s failure to advise him of
 
his right to testify prior to trial did not warrant reversal of
 the district court’s judgment of conviction; and (2) in
 determining that the district court’s Tachibana colloquy, given
 at the close of the State’s case, was not defective and that
 Pomroy’s waiver of his right to testify was valid. Pomroy’s
 arguments are persuasive. 
A. Advisement of, and Waiver of, The Right to Testify
 
1. State v. Tachibana
 
In Tachibana, 79 Hawai' i 226, 900 P.2d 1293, we examined the 
defendant’s right to testify. We first noted that the right to testify is guaranteed by the United States Constitution’s Fifth Amendment guarantee against compelled testimony, Sixth Amendment guarantee of compulsory process, and Fourteenth Amendment 
guarantee of due process; the Hawai' i Constitution’s parallel 
guarantees under Article I, Sections 10, 14, and 5, respectively; 
and HRS § 801-2 (1993)’s statutory protection of the right to testify, which states, “In the trial of any person on the charge of any offense, he shall have a right . . . to be heard in his 
defense.” 79 Hawai' i at 231-32, 900 P.2d at 1298-99 (citing 
12
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
State v. Silva, 78 Hawai' i 115, 122-23, 890 P.2d 702, 709-10 
(App. 1995)). The decision to testify ultimately belongs to the
 
defendant. See 79 Hawai' i at 232, 900 P.2d at 1299. 
We held, “[I]n order to protect the right to testify under
 
the Hawai' i Constitution, trial courts must advise criminal 
defendants of their right to testify and must obtain an on-the­
record waiver of that right in every case in which the defendant
 
does not testify.” 79 Hawai' i at 236, 900 P.2d at 1303 (footnote 
omitted). In a footnote, we stated the purpose and substance of
 
the right-to-testify colloquy as follows:
 
In conducting the colloquy, the trial court must be careful
not to influence the defendant’s decision whether or not to
 testify and should limit the colloquy to advising the
defendant
 
that he [or she] has a right to testify,
that if he [or she] wants to testify that
no one can prevent him [or her] from doing
so, [and] that if he [or she] testifies
the prosecution will be allowed to cross-
examine him [or her]. In connection with
 the privilege against self-incrimination,
the defendant should also be advised that
 he [or she] has a right not to testify and
that if he [or she] does not testify then
the jury can be instructed about that
right.
 
79 Hawai' i at 236 n.7, 900 P.2d at 1303 n.7 (citations omitted). 
As to when the colloquy must be conducted, we noted that
 
“the ideal time to conduct the colloquy is immediately prior to
 
the close of the defendant’s case.” 79 Hawai' i at 237, 900 P.2d 
13
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
at 1304. We also encouraged courts to give the colloquy prior to
 
the start of trial:
 
[A]lthough the ultimate colloquy should be conducted after
all evidence other than the defendant’s testimony has been
received, it would behoove the trial court, prior to the
start of trial, to (1) inform the defendant of his or her
personal right to testify or not to testify and (2) alert
the defendant that, if he or she has not testified by the
end of the trial, the court will briefly question him or her
to ensure that the decision not to testify is the
defendant’s own decision. Such an early warning would
reduce the possibility that the trial court’s colloquy could
have any inadvertent effect on either the defendant’s right
not to testify or the attorney-client relationship.
 
79 Hawai' i at 237 n.9, 900 P.2d at 1304 n.9. 
2. State v. Lewis
 
In Lewis, 94 Hawai' i 292, 12 P.3d 1233, we revisited 
footnote 9 from Tachibana, which recommended a prior-to-trial 
colloquy on the right to testify. The defendant in that case 
(“Lewis”) did testify in his defense. 94 Hawai' i at 294, 12 P.3d 
at 1235. The trial court, however, had not engaged him in a 
colloquy on his right to testify, or to not testify, prior to trial. Id. We held that a Tachibana colloquy was not required 
when a defendant has decided to testify, and that no prior-to­trial Tachibana colloquy was therefore required in Lewis’s case. Prospectively, however, we mandated that “trial courts ‘prior to the start of trial (1) inform the defendant of his or her personal right to testify or not to testify and (2) alert the 
14
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
defendant that, if he or she has not testified by the end of the 
trial, the court will briefly question him or her to ensure that the decision not to testify is the defendant’s own decision.’” 
94 Hawai' i at 297, 12 P.3d at 1238 (footnote omitted). 
We then noted, “Because we view this prior-to-trial 
advisement as incidental to the ‘ultimate colloquy,’ any claim of 
prejudice resulting from the failure of the trial court to give it must meet the same ‘actual[] prejudice[]’ standard applied to violations of the colloquy requirement.” Id. (citing Tachibana, 
79 Hawai' i at 237, 900 P.2d at 1304). See also State v. Han, 130 
Hawai'i 83, 89, 306 P.3d 128, 134 (2013)(“On appeal, the pre­
trial advisement is reviewed for ‘actual prejudice.’”)(citation omitted). 
B. Application of Tachibana and Lewis to Pomroy’s Appeal
 
1. 	The Omission of the Prior-to-Trial Tachibana 
Colloquy
 
On certiorari, Pomroy argues that the ICA erred in finding
 
that he had not shown actual prejudice from the omission of the
 
prior-to-trial Tachibana colloquy. Pomroy argues that he was
 actually prejudiced “by loss of reflection and measured
 consideration of his option to testify or not during the
 presentation of the State’s case.” Further, he argues that
 
15
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
actual prejudice is evident in the district court’s observation
 
that “[n]o other credible evidence” existed to rebut the State’s
 witnesses’ testimony; had Pomroy testified, he could have
 presented credible, conflicting evidence. 
In this case, however, we need not determine whether the 
absence of the prior-to-trial Tachibana colloquy actually prejudiced Pomroy, because we hold that the ultimate Tachibana colloquy was defective, and, therefore, the record does not reflect that Pomroy intelligently, knowingly and voluntarily 
waived the right to testify. See Han, 130 Hawai' i at 89, 306 
P.3d at 134 (“In holding that the failure to properly conduct the
 
Tachibana colloquy was harmful error, infra, the issue of whether
 Petitioner could demonstrate ‘actual prejudice’ with respect to
 the pre-trial colloquy need not be addressed here.”). 
2. The Ultimate Tachibana Colloquy
 
The ICA erred in concluding (1) the district court’s
 
Tachibana advisement was not defective, and (2) that Pomroy had
 intelligently, knowingly, and voluntarily waived his right to
 testify. The district court’s Tachibana advisement was defective
 because it did not fully advise Pomroy of his rights and because
 it was not a true exchange. 
16
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
To recapitulate, the district court began its colloquy as
 
follows:
 
THE COURT: Alright. Mr. Pomroy, before your attorney
[rests the defense’s case], let me advise you. You have the
 
right to testify on your own behalf. That decision is yours
and yours alone. If you choose to testify you will be
subject to cross-examination by the state. If you choose
not to testify, I cannot hold that against you. But the
 only evidence I will have is what the State has presented,
unless you have other witnesses; you understand that?
THE DEFENDANT:  Yes, ma’am.
 
The district court incompletely followed 
Tachibana’s directive that trial courts advise defendants of the
 following:
 
That he [or she] has a right to testify, that if he [or she]
wants to testify that no one can prevent him [or her] from
doing so, [and] that if he [or she] testifies the
prosecution will be allowed to cross-examine him [or her].
In connection with the privilege against self-incrimination,
the defendant should also be advised that he [or she] has a
right not to testify and that if he [or she] does not
testify then the jury can be instructed about that right.
 
79 Hawai' i at 236 n.7, 900 P.2d at 1303 n.7 (citations omitted). 
Although the district court advised Pomroy that he had the right
 
to testify on his behalf and that if he chose to testify, he
 would be subject to cross-examination by the State, the district
 court did not advise Pomroy that he had the right not to testify
 and that no one can prevent him from testifying. 
Further, the district court did not engage Pomroy in a true
 
colloquy. In  Han
, we noted that a colloquy is an “oral exchange”
 
in which the “judge ascertains the defendant’s understanding of
 
17
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the proceedings and of the defendant’s rights.” 130 Hawai' i at 
135, 306 P.3d at 90 (citing Black’s Law Dictionary 300 (9th ed.
 
2009)(emphasis omitted). The failure to engage in a true
 exchange to ascertain the defendant’s understanding of the
 individual rights comprising the Tachibana colloquy results in
  
the failure to “ensure that [the defendant] understood his rights
 [and] amounts to a failure to obtain the on-the-record waiver
 
required by Tachibana.” 130 Hawai' i at 136, 306 P.3d at 91. In 
this case, the district court recited a litany of rights. It
 
then asked Pomroy if he “understood that,” and it is unclear
 which right “that” referenced. 
Moreover, Pomroy’s lack of understanding became increasingly
 
evident as the colloquy continued:
 
THE COURT: Alright. Is it your choice to testify or not?
THE DEFENDANT:
 I think I have already said what has
happened, yeah. I don’t have to testify.
THE COURT: Alright. I don’t know what you mean by “I’ve
already said” because -­THE DEFENDANT: In my report, when I made it two years ago,
what had happened. That’s pretty much what it is.
THE COURT: So you’re talking about what the officer
testified to? Because you understand the police report is
not in evidence. You understand that?
 THE DEFENDANT: I don’t understand what you’re saying.
(Discussion between Counsel and Defendant)
THE COURT: Alright.
THE DEFENDANT: I don’t need any testimony I guess.
THE COURT: Your choice not to testify?
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma’am.
 
From this exchange, it appeared that Pomroy mistakenly believed
 
that whatever he had said in a police report was before the
 
18
  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
court. The district court explained that the police report was
 
not in evidence and that Pomroy would instead have to rely on
 Bohol’s testimony to get his side of the story into evidence.
6
 
Even after this explanation, the district court did not ascertain
 that Pomroy understood what it had told him, or, more
 importantly, understood his right to testify (or not testify). 
On certiorari, Pomroy argues he repeatedly expressed doubt and
 uncertainty over what the district court was telling him. From
 the record before us, we agree.
7
 
6 It may have been preferable for the district court not to comment on
the state of the evidence and to, instead, follow the model colloquy set forth 
in Tachibana. 79 Hawai' i at 236 n.7, 900 P.2d at 1303 n.7. Doing so reduces
the risk that the district court may inadvertently “influence the defendant’s
decision whether or not to testify.” Id. The defendant’s counsel is in a 
better position to advise the defendant to exercise his or her right totestify based on the state of the evidence. 
7 The Majority and Dissent differ chiefly on how to interpret the
colloquy on the record. The Dissent disagrees with our view of the record
that Pomroy was confused during the colloquy. Dissent at 4. The Dissent
 states, “The district court could observe Pomroy’s demeanor and assess the
inflection in his voice, which we cannot do from a cold record, and there is
 no reason to assume that the court would have ignored uncertainty on Pomroy’s
part if that is how he presented to the court.” Dissent at 4. Respectfully,
the Dissent’s statement suggests that the purpose of the colloquy is for the
trial court to make a determination, almost akin to a credibility
determination with respect to viewing witnesses firsthand, that the defendant
understood his or her rights, and that the appellate courts should accept such
 
a determination. See, e.g., Bhakta v. County of Maui, 109 Hawai' i 198, 217, 
124 P.3d 943, 962 (2005)(“This court must, therefore, ‘generally accept the
determination of the court which had the opportunity to observe the demeanorof the witnesses. . . .”)(citation omitted). However, in Han, we noted that one of the reasons for adopting the Tachibana requirement was so “a trialjudge would establish a record that would effectively settle the right-to­
testify issues in the case. . . .” Han, 130 Hawai' i at 136, 306 P.3d 91 
(emphasis added). Appellate review of the sufficiency of the Tachibana
colloquy is necessarily based on a cold record. We are tasked with scrutinizing the language used by both the court and the defendant to assess 
(continued. . .)

The district court “simply advised Petitioner of his rights, 
without any ‘discussion,’ ‘exchange’ or ascertainment that 
Petitioner understood his rights.” Han, 130 Hawai' i at 135, 306 
P.3d at 90. Therefore, the district court “did not adequately 
establish, on-the-record, that Petitioner understood what rights he was waiving” or that he “had in fact understood the rights 
listed by the court. . . .” 130 Hawai' i at 136, 306 P.3d at 91. 
“The failure to ensure that Petitioner understood his rights 
amounts to a failure to obtain the on-the-record waiver required by Tachibana.” Id. In sum, Pomroy’s constitutional right to 
testify was violated. 
“Once a violation of the constitutional right to testify is 
established, the conviction must be vacated unless the State can prove that the violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.” 
Tachibana, 79 Hawai' i at 240, 900 P.2d at 1307 (citations 
omitted). It cannot be said that such violation was harmless 
beyond a reasonable doubt, because it is unknowable from this record whether Pomroy’s testimony, had he given it, could have established reasonable doubt that he committed assault in the 
7(continued . . .)
whether a defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his or
her right to testify. That task cannot be accomplished were we to defer to
the trial court’s apparent assessment of the defendant’s understanding
whenever the express language on the record leaves us with any doubt about the
validity of the colloquy and/or the defendant’s waiver.

third degree. “[I]t is inherently difficult, if not impossible, 
to divine what effect a violation of the defendant’s constitutional right to testify had on the outcome of any particular case. The record in this case offers no clue to what [the defendant] would have said, under oath, on the witness 
stand.” 
State v. Hoang,  94 Hawai' i 271, 279, 12 P.3d 371, 379 
(2000) (citation omitted). See also Tachibana, 79 Hawai' i at 
240, 900 P.2d at 1307 (“From our review of the record, ‘it is 
impossible to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that [Tachibana]’s testimony could not have created a reasonable doubt in the mind of the factfinder and, hence, that the [violation of Tachibana’s right to testify] could not have contributed to the 
conviction.”) (citing Silva, 78 Hawai' i at 126, 890 P.2d at 713). 
Pomroy has shown a violation of the constitutional right to
 
testify that cannot be considered harmless beyond a reasonable
 
doubt. Therefore, his conviction cannot stand. 
B. 	 Sufficiency of the Evidence and Credibility of the
Complaining Witness 
Next, we address whether this court must reverse Pomroy’s
 
conviction due to double jeopardy based on insufficiency of the
 evidence, or vacate and remand his case for a new trial. 
Principles of double jeopardy do not preclude a retrial in this
 
21
  
  
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
case because substantial evidence supported Pomroy’s conviction. 
See State v. Kalaola, 124 Hawai' i 43, 237 P.3d 1109 (2010)(“[T]he 
double jeopardy clause does not bar retrial on the means of 
establishing guilt for which there was sufficient evidence at trial” because “error in this case was trial error.”)(citing 
State v. Jones, 96 Hawai' i 161, 184 n.30, 29 P.3d 351, 374 n.30 
(2001)). 
On certiorari, Pomroy argues that the ICA erred in
 
concluding there was substantial evidence to support the district
 
court’s conclusion that Pomroy assaulted Lukens. While Pomroy
 agrees that “testimony of feeling pain alone could conceivably
 support a conviction of Assault in the Third Degree,” he
 nonetheless argues that “[c]ommon sense tells us that if [Lukens]
 had testified truthfully about the mechanism of his alleged
 injuries, physical evidence of those injuries would have been
 necessarily visible. . . .” Pomroy argues that the lack of
 physical corroborative evidence indicates the assault “could not
 have occurred,” regardless of whether the evidence (or absence of
 evidence) is viewed in the light most favorable to the State. To
 Pomroy, Lukens’ testimony “defied physics and human biology.”
 
We disagree. To convict Pomroy for the offense of assault
 
in the third degree in violation of HRS § 707-712(1)(a), the
 
22
  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
State needed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Pomroy 
intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly caused bodily injury to Lukens; bodily injury is defined in HRS § 707-700 to include “physical pain.” This court views the evidence adduced at trial “in the strongest light for the prosecution. . . .” State v. 
Matavale, 115 Hawai i 149, 157, 166 P.3d 322, 330 (2007)(citation omitted). The test on appeal is whether substantial evidence 
supports the trier of fact’s conclusion. 115 Hawai' i at 157-58, 
166 P.3d at 330-31 (citation omitted). “‘Substantial evidence’ 
as to every material element of the offense charged is credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable [a person] of reasonable caution to support a conclusion.” 
115 Hawai' i at 158, 166 P.3d at 331 (citation omitted). 
At trial, Lukens testified that he felt physical pain that
 
measured a seven or eight on a ten-point scale. Berbelis
 
testified that Lukens complained to her of feeling pain.
 Kubojiri also testified that Lukens complained to him of physical
 pain. Pomroy argues that Lukens could not have been telling the
 truth if no physical injuries were visible after the assault he
 describes. This court, however, has stated, “Indeed, even if it
 could be said in a bench trial that the conviction is against the
 weight of the evidence, as long as there is substantial evidence
 
23
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
to support the requisite findings for conviction, the trial court 
will be affirmed.” Matavale,  115 Hawai' i at 158, 166 P.3d at 331 
(citation omitted). Further, the district court found Lukens’ 
(and Berbelis’) testimony to be credible. “The question of credibility and the weight to be given the evidence is for the trier of fact to determine and is not disturbed on appeal.” 
State v. Ewing, 81 Hawai' i 156, 165, 914 P.2d 549, 558 (App. 
1996)(citation omitted). It is well-settled that an appellate 
court will not pass upon issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence; this is the province of the trier of fact.” Therefore, substantial evidence supports Pomroy’s conviction, and the prohibition against double jeopardy does not preclude a remand of this case to the district court for a new trial. 
V. Conclusion 
We hold that the district court’s ultimate 
Tachibana
 
colloquy was defective because it incompletely advised Pomroy of
 his right to testify and because it did not establish that Pomroy
 understood his rights. As a result, the district court did not
 obtain an on-the-record waiver of the right to testify from
 Pomroy. Thus, Pomroy has demonstrated a constitutional violation
 of his right to testify, which, under the circumstances of this
 
24
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
case, cannot be considered harmless. We also hold that
 
substantial evidence supports Pomroy’s conviction; consequently,
 the prohibition against double jeopardy does not preclude
 retrial. We therefore vacate the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal,
 vacate the district court’s Judgment of Conviction and Sentence,
 and remand this case to the district court for a new trial.
