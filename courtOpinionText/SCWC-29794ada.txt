OPINION  OF  THE  COURT  BY  ACOBA,  J.
 
We hold that the complaints filed by the Respondent/
 
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai' i (the State) against 
Petitioners/Defendants-Appellants Nelson Kuualoha Armitage
 
(Armitage), Russel Kahookele (Kahookele), and Henry Maile Noa
 (Noa) (collectively, Petitioners) of the offense of Entrance into
 the Reserve (Kaho' olawe Reserve or the Reserve), Hawai' i 
Administrative Rule (HAR) § 13-261-10 (2002)
1
 must be dismissed
without prejudice because the charges failed to charge the
 requisite state of mind of intentionally, knowingly, or
 recklessly. 
See State v. Apollonio , 130 Hawai' i 353, 354, 311 
P.3d 676, 677 (2013). Because of the likelihood of retrial, we 
1 HAR § 13-261-10 provides:
 
No person or vessel shall enter or attempt to enter into or
remain within the reserve unless such person or vessel :
(a) Is specifically authorized to do so by the
commission or its authorized representative as
provided in section 13-261-11 ; or,
(b) Is specifically authorized to do so through a
written agreement approved by the commission; or,
(c) Is trolling in zone B, in compliance with section
13-361-13(b)(3); or,
(d) Must enter the reserve to prevent probable loss of
vessel or human life, provided that:
(1) Prior to entering the reserve
and at reasonable intervals
 thereafter, such person shall make
every reasonable effort to notify
the commission staff or the United
 States Coast Guard that loss of
 vessel or human life is probable;
(2) All fishing gear shall be stowed
immediately upon entering the reserve; and
(3) Such person shall vacate the reserve
immediately after the threat of probable
loss of vessel or human life has passed.
 
(Emphasis added.) HAR § 13-261-11 (2002) is set forth infra at n.11.

         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
discuss the questions raised in the September 16, 2013 
application for writ of certiorari (Application) filed by Petitioners, and conclude (1) there was sufficient evidence adduced at trial to sustain Petitioners’ conviction, (2) Petitioners did not “reasonably exercise[]” their constitutionally protected native Hawaiian rights, see State v. Hanapi, 89 Hawai' i 177, 184, 970 P.2d 485, 493 (1998), (3) 
because Petitioners were subject to penal liability pursuant to HAR § 13-261-10, they have “a claim of specific present objective harm”, City & Cnty. of Honolulu v. Ariyoshi, 67 Haw. 412, 419, 689 P.2d 757, 765 (1984), and therefore have standing to challenge the constitutionality of that regulation, (4) Art. XII, section 7 of the Hawai' i Constitution does not create a separate 
right to nation-building, (5) Petitioners’ purpose to claim and manage, control and subsequently occupy Kaho' olawe involved 
conduct outside the scope of any first amendment right to freedom of speech, (6) HAR §§ 13-261-10 or -11 does not abridge the constitutional right under the Hawai' i Constitution to engage in 
traditional and customary native Hawaiian practices, and (7) Petitioners’ practice of religion was not substantially burdened by HAR §§ 13-261-10 and -11. Accordingly, we vacate the July 17, 2013 judgment of the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) and the April 3, 2009 judgments of the District Court of the Second

Circuit (the court)  and remand the case for disposition
consistent with this opinion. 
I. 
A.
 
This case arises from three separate complaints filed
 
by the State against Armitage, Kahookele, and Noa, alleging that,
 as noted, each defendant committed the offense of Entrance into
 the Reserve, HAR § 13-261-10. The complaint against Armitage and
 the complaint against Kahookele were filed on August 22, 2006,
 and the complaint against Noa was filed on August 28, 2006. The
 complaints stated as follows:
 
The STATE OF HAWAI 'I, through the undersigned, its
Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, hereby accuses and charges the
Defendant as follows: 
That on or about the 31st day of July, 2006, in the
Division of Wailuku, County of Maui, State of Hawaii, [thedefendant] did enter or attempt to enter into, or remainwithin the Kaho 'olawe Island Reserve without being
specifically authorized to do so by the commission or itsauthorized representative, thereby committing the offense ofEntrance Into the Reserve, in violation of Section 13-261-10of the [HAR], Department of Land and Natural Resources. 
Petitioners all pled not guilty to the offense. 
On October 18, 2006, Petitioners filed a Motion to
 
Consolidate their cases pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Penal 
Procedure (HRPP) Rule 13 (2006)3. In the Motion to Consolidate,
 
2
 The Honorable Simone C. Polak presided.
 
3
 HRPP Rule 13 provides, in relevant part:
 
(a) Generally. The court may order consolidation of two or
more charges for trial if the offenses, and the defendants
if there are more than one, could have been joined in a
single charge.

        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Petitioners noted that the only difference in factual 
circumstances among Petitioners was that Noa was on a boat on the waters of the Kaho' olawe Reserve, while Armitage and Kahookele 
were on land in the Reserve. The court held a hearing on the Motion to Consolidate on October 26, 2006 and granted the Motion to Consolidate. 
B.
 
On January 9, 2007, Petitioners filed a Motion to 
Dismiss pursuant to HRPP Rule 12 (2006)
4. In their Memorandum in 
Support of the Motion to Dismiss, Petitioners appeared to challenge the court’s jurisdiction, offer defenses to the charge, and bring a constitutional challenge to the validity of HAR § 13­261-10. Among these arguments, Petitioners asked the court to recognize their Restored Hawaiian Government (also referred to as the Reinstated Kingdom of Hawai' i or Reinstated Nation of Hawai' i) 
as “the sovereign Native Hawaiian entity” pursuant to Hawai' i 
4 HRPP Rule 12 provides, in relevant part:
 
(b) Pretrial motions. Any defense, objection, or request
which is capable of determination without the trial of the
general issue may be raised before trial by Motion. Motions
 may be written or oral at the discretion of the judge. The
 following must be raised prior to trial;
(1) defenses and objections based on defects in
the institution of the prosecution;
(2) defenses and objections based on defects in
the charge (other than that it fails to show
jurisdiction in the court or to charge an
offense which objections shall be noticed by the
court at any time during the pendency of the
proceedings)[.]

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 6K-9 (1993)5. Petitioners argued, inter 
alia, that the charges should be dismissed because Petitioners 
could prove the defense of privilege under Public Access Shoreline Hawai' i v. Hawai' i County Planning Commission (“PASH”), 
79 Hawai' i 425, 903 P.2d 1246 (1995), and Hanapi, and that the 
regulations were unconstitutional. As an attachment to the Motion to Dismiss, Petitioners included a Declaration of Noa, which stated that he is the “democratically elected Prime Minister of the Reinstated Hawaiian Nation” and concluded as follows: “[i]n sum, the Kingdom of Hawaii/Government has reemerged with a working, sovereign government and demands the return of all Kingdom assets and the State of Hawai' i immediately 
return the island of Kahoolawe to the Kingdom of Hawaii/Government.” 
In its Memorandum in Opposition to the Motion to
 
Dismiss, filed on July 17, 2007, the State argued, inter alia,
 that the court had jurisdiction, Petitioners admitted the
 violation, the relevant administrative rules and statutes were
 
5 HRS  §  6K-9  provides:
 
Upon its return to the State, the resources and waters of
Kaho'olawe shall be held in trust as part of the public land
trust; provided that the State shall transfer management and
control of the island and its waters to the sovereign nativeHawaiian entity upon its recognition by the United Statesand the State of Hawai 'i. 
All terms, conditions, agreements, and laws affecting the
island, including any ongoing obligations relating to the
clean-up of the island and its waters, shall remain in
effect unless expressly terminated.
 
(Emphasis added.)

         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
constitutional, and that the court was not the proper forum to 
recognize the Reinstated Kingdom of Hawai' i as a sovereign 
nation. 
Petitioners filed a reply on July 26, 2007, asserting 
what they termed the “Lorenzo defense” based on the ICA’s decision in State v. Lorenzo, 77 Hawai' i 219, 883 P.2d 641 (App. 
1994), that future courts would consider evidence and arguments in support of recognition of the inherent sovereignty of native Hawaiians. Petitioners also maintained that they are citizens of a nation rather than a group and that “[t]he fact that there are other ‘groups’ out there, or that the State is trying to create its own domestic dependent nation (as opposed to a true-sovereign nation - the type of nation for which Kahoolawe is held in trust) is not relevant to [the Lorenzo] defense.” 
The court held evidentiary hearings on the Motion to 
Dismiss. On July 27, 2007, John Gates (Gates) testified for Petitioners as an expert in the areas of self-determination of indigenous people and international law. The hearing was continued to January 25, 2008. Petitioner Noa testified on his own behalf regarding his status as “Prime Minister of the Reinstated Hawaiian Government” and about the underlying incident, which he stated was undertaken to pursue the reinstatement of the Kingdom of Hawai' i. 
The next hearing took place on April 4, 2008. At the
 
outset, the court indicated that the parties would give a brief
 oral summary of what they believed the evidence had shown and
 
7
         
          
        
      
             
            ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
provided that the parties were in agreement, they would submit
 
written arguments as well as proposed findings of fact and
 conclusions of law. The court would then make its decision and
 if necessary, advise the parties of the trial date and set a
 pretrial at which further issues could be addressed. Then,
 Petitioner Noa continued his testimony and was cross-examined by
 the State. 
Petitioners’ attorney indicated that Petitioners “would
 
treat this hearing as if Mr. [Armitage] and Mr. Kahookele also
 testified, and with the exception of their position within their
 elected government[ 
6
], their testimony would mirror that of Mr.
Noa.” The State agreed. 
Petitioner’s attorney also stated his
 
clients were prepared to waive any conflict as to counsel. 
The court engaged in a colloquy with Noa, Armitage and
 
Kahookele, and all three Petitioners agreed to waive any conflict
 in representation. At the request of the court, each party then
 summarized its arguments on the record. 
The parties each submitted proposed findings of fact and
 
conclusions of law with respect to the Motion to Dismiss. On
 October 9, 2008, the court issued its “Findings of Fact
 [(findings)], Conclusion of Law [(conclusions)] and Order Denying
 Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss.” 
The relevant findings follow:7
 
6
 For example, Noa testified that he was “Prime Minister of the
 
Reinstated Hawaiian Government,” while Armitage and Kahookele apparently held
different positions in the Reinstated Hawaiian Government.

 Many of the findings of fact entered by the court on the Motion to
 
Dismiss were repeated in the March 10, 2009 Stipulation as to Evidence, which

1. On or about July 31, 2006, [] Armitage, Kahookele, and
Noa traveled to Kaho 'olawe as elected representatives and
citizens of the Reinstated Kingdom of Hawai 'i for purposes of
exercising and proclaiming the Reinstated Kingdom’s property
rights in the Kaho 'olawe Island Reserve and its adjacent
waters, to build an ahu [ 8
], and to offer prayer on the

10. [] Noa had knowledge that the Reserve had served as a
bombing range for approximately fifty years. []
 11. [Petitioners] assert that the State’s “compelling 
interest in restricting access to Kaho 'olawe is to protect
citizens from dangers that may still exist on the island from
military activity. [Petitioners] do not challenge this as a compelling interest - to do so would be unreasonable .” 
12. [Petitioners] traveled to the Reserve to claim 
Kaho'olawe and to manage and control the island. 
. . . .
 
14. Notwithstanding [Petitioners’] expert testimony, and
even assuming the general accuracy of the expert’s opinion,
Defendants have failed to prove that the Reinstated Nation ofHawai'i is a sovereign native Hawaiian entity and the [c]ourt
lacks authority to make such a determination. 
15. To date, no sovereign native Hawaiian entity has been
recognized by the United States and the State of Hawai 'i;
however, there are several native Hawaiian organizations, in
addition to [Petitioners], seeking this recognition. 
16. [Petitioners] request this court recognize the
reinstated Nation of Hawai 'i as the sovereign native Hawaiian 
entity and to “provide guidance as to exactly what need[s] to
be done to achieve Hawaii’s elusive promise of recognition tothe re-emerged Hawaiian nation that was illegally overthrownin 1893.

standards or guidelines to resolve their attempt to be
recognized by the State and Federal governments as the native
Hawaiian sovereign entity.

access and gathering rights necessary for subsistence,

11. The application process set forth in HAR § 13-261­
11(b) follows the requirements made by the [c]ourt in Hanapi
and includes a process by which an applicant to the Reserve,
through consultation with cultural practitioners, can
establish the existence of [] traditional or customary
native Hawaiian practices.
 
12. The Historical Note section of HAR § 13-261 states,
“In recognition of the substantial amount of unexploded
ordnance and hazardous materials present on the island andin the adjacent waters, institutional controls are requiredbecause of the imminent  th
 reat  to  public  health  and  safety
which will continue to exist until the Kaho 'ol awe island 
reserve has been cleared of unexploded ordnance andhazardous waste. (Emphasis added.) 
13. T
he process defined in HAR § 13-261-11 , does not
prohibit people from accessing the Reserve to exercise
native Hawaiian traditional and customary rights; rather, it
enables the KIRC, who has a compelling interest to protect
the health and safety of all those who access the Reserve,
to determine if the exercise of those rights is feasible and
whether it can be done in [a] manner that ensures the safety
of the practitioners .
 
14. [Petitoners’] purpose to claim and manage control and
subsequently occupy Kaho 'olawe involved conduct outside the 
scope of any first amendment right to freedom of speech.State v. Jim , 105 Haw[ai 'i] 319, 97 P.3d 295 (2004) [(]
citing Procunier v. Martinez , 416 U.S. 396, 411-12 []
(1974).[)] 
15. The government may impose reasonable restrictions on
the time, place, or manner of engaging in protected speech
provided that they are adequately justified without
reference to the content of the regulated speech. City of
Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc. , 507 U.S. 410, 428
(1993).
 
16. The application process set forth in HAR § 13-261-11
is clearly content-neutral, as the rule only sets time,
place, or manner restrictions on the access applicants,
without any burdens on speech.
 
17. [Petitioners] cannot argue that the procedure set
forth in HAR § 13-261-11 prohibited them from exercising
their First Amendment rights, if they never attempted to

employ the application and approval process .
 
18. The procedural requirements in HAR § 13-261-11 are
content-neutral, only impose time, place, and manner
restrictions, and apply equally to all who wish to access
the Reserve in order to ensure the health and safety of the
public, and to prevent uses that are dangerous, unlawful, or
impermissible under HRS [Chapter] 6K.
 
19. [Petitioners] did not prove their deprivation of the
right to free exercise of religion, because their testimony
and evidence failed to establish “that such practice is an
integral part of a religious faith and the prohibition . . .
results in a virtual inhibition of the religion or the
practice of the faith .” [] State v. Blake , 5 Haw. App. 411,
413[, 695 P.2d 336, 338] (1982) [(quoting] People v.
Mullins , 50 Cal. App. 61, 70, 123 Cal. Rptr. 201, 207
(1975)[)] [(emphasis in original)].

 22. The Apology Resolution [Pub.L.No. 103-150, 107 Stat.
1510, 1510 (1993)] and related State legislation, including
HRS Chapter 6K “gave rise to the State’s fiduciary duty to
preserve the corpus of the public land trust, specifically
ceded lands, until such time as the unrelinquished claims of
the native Hawaiians have been resolved.” Office of
 
Hawaiian Affairs v. HCDCH , 117 Haw. 174, 177 P.3d 884
(2008).
 
23. The Apology Resolution acknowledges only that
unrelinquished claims (by Native Hawaiians) exist and
plainly contemplates future reconciliation with the United
States and the state with regard to those claims.” Id.
 
24. The [s]upreme [c]ourt [of the Territory of Hawai 'i] in
Territory v. Kapiolani Estate , refused to recognize a claim
disputing the Territory’s title to ceded lands, and held: 
The validity of the declaration in theconstitution of the Republic of Hawai 'i, under
which the present title is derived, does not
present a judicial question . Even assuming , but
in no way admitting, that the constitutional
declaration was confiscatory in nature, thiscourt has no authority to declare it invalid .
The subsequent derivation of the title by theuntied States is clear. The position here takenin refusing to regard the defendant’s claim thattitle is otherwise than is fixed byconstitutional law as presenting a judicialquestion is well illustrated in numerousdecisions of the United States Supreme Court. 
18 Haw. 640, [] 645-46 (1908) [(emphasis added)].

explains that its enactment “will not result in any changes
 in existing law.” S.Rep.No . 103-26, at 35, Ex. M. (1993).
 
29. While the United States expressed its deep regret to
the Native Hawaiian people for the federal government’sparticipation in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai 'i,
and pledged to support recogniliation efforts, the Apologyresolution did not create any substantive rights. See 
also[,] Rice v. Cayetano , 941 F.Supp. 1529, 1546 []n. 24 (D.
Hawai'i 1996), rev’d on other grounds [by] 528 U.S. 495
(2000). 
30. An action by this [c]ourt would, in turn, direct
Congress and the State Legislature to recognize the
Reinstated Nation of Hawai 'i as the native Hawaiian 
sovereign entity, and this [c]ourt cannot act where Congressand the State Legislature must.

On March 10, 2009, the parties entered a Stipulation as
 
to Evidence, stating as follows:
 
1. On or about July 31, 2006, [Petitioners] [Armitage],
[Kahookele], and [Noa] entered the Kaho 'olawe island reserv e 
(“Reserve”) in the County of Maui, State of Hawai 'i. 
2. [HAR §] 13-261-3 defines the boundary of the Reserve 
as “the entire island of Kaho 'olawe and those waters and 
submerged lands seaward of the shoreline of Kaho 'olawe 
island to a distance of approximately two miles.” 
3. [Petitioners] Armitage, Kahookele, and Noa entered the
waters of the Reserve and landed on the island of Kaho 'olawe 
in the area of Hakioawa. 4. [Petitioner] Noa was cited by the Department of Land
and Natural Resources (DLNR) Division of Conservation and
Resources Enforcement (DOCARE) Officer Kapahuleha forProhibited Entry into the Kaho 'olawe Island Reserve in 
violation of HAR [§] 13-251-10. 
5. [Petitioners] Armitage and Kahookele were placed under
arrest by DLNR DOCARE Officers for Prohibited Entrance into
the Kaho 'olawe Island Reserve in violation of HAR [§] 13­
261-10. 
6. HAR [§] 13-261-10, reads in relevant part: “No person
or vessel shall enter or attempt to enter into or remain
within the reserve unless such person or vessel: (a) Is
specifically authorized to do so by the commission or its
authorized representatives as provided in section 13-261-11;
or (b) Is specifically authorized to do so though a written
agreement approved by the commission; or (c) Is trolling in
zone B, in compliance with section 13-261-13(b)(3); or (d)
Must enter the reserve to prevent probable loss of vessel or
human life.”
 
7. [Petitioners] were not specifically authorized by the
commission or its authorized representative to enter into or
remain within the Reserve as provided in section 13-261-11 ,
which reads in relevant part: “Procedure for the
 authorization of entrance into and activity within the
reserve. (a) Any person required by this chapter to obtain
commission authorization to enter into or conduct activity
within the reserve shall apply for such authorization by
making written application to the commission.
 
8. [Petitioners] did not make a written application to
the commission for the authorization of entrance into and
 
activity within the Reserve .
 
9. [Petitioners] were not specifically authorized to
 
15
         
         
    
        
          
         
         
   
       
      
    
       
       
         
        
         
       
        
       
      
       
        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
enter into or remain in the Reserve through a written
agreement approved by the commission.
 
10. [Petitioners] were not trolling in zone B, the waters
of the Reserve that are deeper than thirty fathoms in depth,
and the submerged lands beneath such waters from the point
where the thirty fathoms begins and proceeding out to the
boundary of the Reserve.
 
11. [Petitioners] did not enter the Reserve to prevent
probable loss of vessel or human life.
 . . . .
 21. The State and [Petitioners] agree and stipulate, that
all testimony, including expert testimony that was presented
during the hearing on the Motion to Dismiss is fully
incorporated into the trial on this matter, and such
testimony shall be considered to have been taken at trial .
 
22. The State and [Petitioners] agree and stipulate, that
all exhibits that were admitted into evidence during the
hearing on [Petitioners’] Motion to Dismiss are also
admitted, without objection, into evidence at trial.
 
23. The State and [Petitioners] request that the [c]ourt
take judicial notice of all filings in [Petitioners’] case.
 
(Emphases added.) The Stipulation was signed by each Petitioner. 
On April 3, 2010, the court held a stipulated facts
 
trial. At the outset of the trial, the court stated as follows
 
with respect to the acceptance of the stipulation:
 
The  stipulation  itself  does  not  contain  an
acknowledgment  of  the  rights  that  the  defendants  would  be
giving  up  by  the  [c]ourt  accepting  the  stipulation,  so  the
[c]ourt  wants  to  be  assured  that  all  defendants  knowingly,
willingly,  and  voluntarily  agree  that  the  stipulation,  which
has  been  signed,  should  be  considered  by  the  [c]ourt.
  
Therefore,  the  [c]ourt  is  going  to  do  an  advisement  on  the
record,  and  it  will  be  -- what  I’ll  do  is  I’ll  state  what
 
your  rights  are,  and  then  after  each  one  I’ll  ask  you.   And
 
I  think  we  have  done  this  the  last  time,  so  I  think  you
folks  know  how  this  works.
 
So,  first  of  all,  I  do  want  to  advise  you  that  you
have  a  right  to  have  a  trial  in  this  matter.   We  are  set  for
 
trial  today.   And,  as  I  indicated,  the  stipulation  appears
to  sort  of  alleviate  the  necessity  of  a  trial.   So  I  want  to
 
be  sure  that  you  understand,  first,  you  have  a  right  to  have
a  trial  in  this  matter.   Can  I  get  an  agreement  from  each  of
 
the  defendants?
 
Each Petitioner then stated his name and assented, and the court
 proceeded to ask Petitioners, first, “do you understand that at
 
16
         
            
            
         
        
              
          
             
            
          
             
     
             
          
             
         
            
              
            
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
trial it would be the Government’s burden to prove each of the
 
elements of the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt?”, to
 which each Petitioner replied “Yes”. Second, the court related
 that the stipulation appeared to cover all of the essential
 elements of the offense charged, and asked Petitioners if “each
 one of you is willing to stipulate, in other words, to agree,
 that these facts that are set forth as stipulations, that the
 Court shall accept those inclusively without any further witness
 testifying.” Each Petitioner independently indicated their
 assent. Third, the court asked the Petitioners to “indicate for
 the record that you, in fact, have signed the stipulation as to
 evidence.” Again, Petitioners each indicated assent.
11
 
The court then engaged in a Tachibana colloquy with
 
Petitioners. See Tachibana v. State, 79 Hawai' i 226, 900 P.2d 
1293 (1995).12 The court noted that Noa had testified at the
 
earlier hearing, stated that it did not think it needed to redo
 the waiver, but wanted to address that issue out of an abundance
 
11 In State v. Murray , 116 Hawai 'i 3, 10, 169 p.3d 955, 962 (2007), 
this court held that “[t]he defendant’s right to have each element of an
offense proven beyond a reasonable doubt is a constitutionally andstatutorily[] protected right[,]” and accordingly, a stipulation waiving proofof an element of the charge must be made knowingly and voluntarily. In lightof this on-the-record colloquy, this case is distinguishable from State v.
Pratt, 127 Hawai 'i 206, 277 P.3d 200 (2012), where “the record [was] silent as
to whether [the defendant] understood he had [] a right [to have theprosecution establish each element of the charged offense beyond a reasonabledoubt] or that [the defendant] waived [that] right.” 127 Hawai 'i at 225, 277 
P.3d at 319 (Acoba, J., dissenting). 
12
 The Tachibana colloquy is an “oral exchange . . . in which [the 
court] ascertains the defendant’s understanding of the proceedings and of thedefendant’s rights.” State v. Chong Hung Han , 130 Hawai 'i 83, 90, 206 P.3d
128, 136 (2013) (emphases omitted) (internal quotation marks and citationomitted). The Tachibana colloquy is designed to ensure that the defendant is
aware of his or her right to testify and that he or she knowingly andvoluntarily waived that right. Tachibana , 79 Hawai 'i at 237, 900 P.2d at 
1304. 
17
         
        
            
         
          
           ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
of caution. 
The State argued that all the elements of the offense
 
were proven against each Petitioner beyond a reasonable doubt. 
In response, defense counsel maintained that Petitioners were not
 guilty because they acted as nationals of a sovereign government,
 a defense which the State had not disproved beyond a reasonable
 doubt. In rebuttal, the State answered that the defense did not
 raise a reasonable doubt as to Petitioners’ guilt.
 
The court found that “the State has proven its case 
beyond a reasonable doubt . . . that [Petitioners] ha[d] violated HAR [§] 13-261-10 by entering the Reserve area without specific authorization by [the Kaho' olawe Island Reserve Commission (KIRC 
or the commission)], and without having had any of the other reasons . . . which would also be an exception.” The court further noted that it disbelieved Gates’ testimony and rejected the sovereign nation defense. Petitioners were found guilty and the court sentenced each Petitioner, but stayed execution of the sentences pending appeal. 
II.
 
On April 21, 2009, Petitioners filed a Notice of Appeal
 
with the ICA. In their Opening Brief, they set forth a number of
 arguments, two of which are relevant to the instant
 Application.
13 They asserted, inter alia, that “the court
 
13
 In addition, Petitioners argued that (1) “the court committed
 
plain error when it determined it was incompetent to make a determination of
sovereignty and when it thus declined to recognize [Petitioners’] nations’s
inherent sovereignty”; and (2) the court “engaged in improper burden shifting
and committed reversible error when it failed to require the prosecution as

18
         
 
  
         
       ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
applied the wrong standard when it rejected [Petitioners’]
 
defense that the regulations they are alleged to have violated
 are unconstitutional as a prior restraint on Native Hawaiian
 rights” and that “the court was in error when it rejected
 [Petitioners’] defense of privilege under Pash and Hanapi.” 
III.
 
As noted, the ICA issued its SDO on April 30, 2013.
14 
State v. Armitage, 129 Hawai' i 425, 301 P.3d 1266, 2013 WL 
1829663, at *1 (App. April 30, 2013). In response to Petitioners’ apparent defense that they were engaging in establishment of a sovereign native Hawaiian government, the ICA concluded that this court’s recent decision in State v. Kaulia, 128 Hawai' i 479, 291 P.3d 377 (2013), resolved the issue. Id. at 
*2. The ICA noted that, analogous to Kaulia, “[Petitioners] contend the ‘legitimacy’ of the Reinstated Nation of Hawai' i as 
the sovereign native Hawaiian entity renders them ‘exempt from the application of the State’s laws.” Id. According to the ICA, 
individuals claiming to be citizens of an independent sovereign entity are not exempt from the state’s laws, and therefore the district court did not err in rejecting Petitioner’s defense based on their sovereignty claims. 
13...continue
 
p
art  of  its  burden  of  persuasion  to  prove  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  the  facts
negativing  [Petitioners’]  non-affirmative  defenses.”
 
14
 The ICA’s SDO was issued by Chief Judge Craig H. Nakamura, Judge
 
Alexa D.M. Fujise, and Judge Katherine G. Leonard.
 
19
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
The ICA also concluded that Petitioners’ conduct was 
not protected by the privilege for customary and traditional 
native Hawaiian practices under article XII, section 7 of the Hawai'i Constitution. Id. at *3. Applying the balancing test in 
Pratt, the ICA explained that, the regulations restricting access to the Reserve are necessary to protect health and safety, and that persons seeking access to the Reserve in order to exercise traditional and customary native Hawaiian rights and practices may apply with the commission for approval. Id. (citing HAR § 
13-261-11). In this case, Petitioners had not attempted to use the regulatory process, and under these circumstances the ICA determined that the State was entitled to prosecute Petitioners. Id. 
Finally, the ICA reasoned that the regulations at issue
 
were constitutional, because they were supported by a compelling
 State interest in protecting the public’s health and safety, and
 included consideration of requests based on the exercise of
 traditional and customary rights and practices. Id. at *4. The
 
ICA therefore upheld the court’s judgments against Petitioners. 
IV.
 
Petitioners filed their amended Application with this
 
court on September 16, 2013, asking whether (1) “HAR § 13-261-11
 is . . . unconstitutional as a prior restraint on traditional and
 customary Native Hawaiian rights and religious rights” and
 “whether the regulations were narrowly drawn” even if a
 compelling state interest were involved; and (2) whether the ICA
 
20
         
         
          
           
             
        
        
               
           
         
             
          
       
           
            
          
           
   
       
          
      ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
erred “in failing to analyze [HAR] §13-261-11 in light of
 
fundamental rights, instead deciding this case based on subject
 matter jurisdiction[.]” The State did not file a Response.
 
V.
 
The sufficiency of the complaints is not raised by
 
either party.
15 However, the complaint failed to adequately
 
allege that Petitioners violated HAR § 13-261-10 intentionally,
 knowingly, or recklessly. Therefore, the complaint must be
 dismissed without prejudice. See Apollonio, 130 Hawai' i at 359, 
311 P.3d at 682; see also Gonzalez, 128 Hawai' i at 324, 288 P.3d 
at 798; State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai' i 48, 51, 276 P.3d 617, 620 
(2012).

 The complaints  charged Petitioners with violating HAR
§ 13-261-10. To reiterate, HAR § 13-261-10 provides that “[n]o
 person or vessel shall enter or attempt to enter into or remain
 
15 Upon this court’s acceptance of certiorari, the parties were asked 
to provide supplemental briefing on whether the complaints must be dismissed
without prejudice under Apollonio , 130 Hawai 'i at 359, 311 P.3d at 682,
because they did not allege the state of mind required to commit the offenseof Entrance into the Reserve, HAR § 13-261-10.
The State’s Supplemental Brief first conceded that the complaints
did fail to set forth the requisite state of mind for the offense. The State
 also conceded that the complaints were deficient because they failed to state
“which ‘reserve’” Petitioners entered, “which commission” was involved, or set
forth the appropriate state of mind for an attempt offense. Based on the
 disposition set forth herein, we need not address these additional matters.
Petitioners’ Supplemental Brief also argues that the complaints
failed to charge the requisite state of mind, that therefore, the charges
failed to state an offense and thus must be dismissed with prejudice.
Petitioners further allege, as discussed infra, that the charges should be
dismissed with prejudice because any new charges would be time-barred by the
statute of limitations.
 
16
 To reiterate, the State filed individual complaints against
 
Armitage, Kahookele, and Noa. Each complaint set forth identical allegations
for the purposes of the discussion infra.

within the reserve unless such person or vessel” is authorized to
 
do so, or the person or vessel meets one of the other
 exceptions.
17 HAR § 13-261-10 does not specify the state of mind
 
required to establish entry into the reserve. Under the Hawai' i 
Penal Code, when a penal law does not specify the relevant state
 of mind, “that element is established if, with respect thereto, a
 person acts intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly,” HRS § 702­204
18
  , unless the offense is either a violation or an absolute
liability offense. HRS § 702-212.19
 
First, HAR § 13-261-10 is not a violation. Pursuant to
 
HRS § 701-107(5) an offense “constitutes a violation if it is so
 
17 As stated previously, HAR § 13-261-10 also provides exceptions for
 
persons or vessels who are “trolling in zone B, in compliance with section
 
13-361-13(b)(3),” and persons or vessels who “[m]ust enter the reserve to
prevent probable loss of vessel or human life[.]”
 
18 HRS § 702–204 provides in relevant part as follows:
 
Except as provided in section 702–212 , a person is not guilty of
an offense unless the person acted intentionally, knowingly,
recklessly, or negligently, as the law specifies, with respect to
each element of the offense. When the state of mind required to
establish an element of an offense is not specified by the law,
that element is established if, with respect thereto, a person
acts intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly .
 
(Emphases added.)
 
19 HRS § 702-212 provides in relevant part as follows
 
The state of mind requirements prescribed by sections 702–204 and
702–207 through 702–211 do not apply to :
 
(1) An offense which constitutes a violation , unless the state of
mind requirement involved is included in the definition of the
violation or a legislative purpose to impose such a requirement
plainly appears; or
 
(2) A crime defined by statute other than this Code, insofar as a
legislative purpose to impose absolute liability for such offense
or with respect to any element thereof plainly appears .
 
(Emphases added.)
 
22
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
designated in . . . the law defining the offense or if no other
 
sentence than a fine, or fine and forfeiture or other civil
 penalty, is authorized upon conviction. . . .” However, HRS §
 6K-8 provides that “[a]ny person who violates the law or rules
 applicable to the island reserve,” including HAR § 13-261-10,
 “shall be fined not more that $1,000 or imprisoned not more than
 30 days, or both[.]” (Emphasis added.) Additionally, HAR § 13­261-10 is not specifically designated as a violation.
 
Moreover, a legislative purpose to impose absolute 
liability does not “plainly appear” from either the legislative history of HAR § 13-261-10. The commentary to HRS § 702-212 “counsels that strict liability ‘should not be discerned lightly by the courts,’ that HRS § 702–212(2) ‘severely limits the situations which will allow the imposition of absolute criminal liability,’ and that ‘strict liability in the penal law is indefensible in principle if conviction results in the possibility of imprisonment.’” Gonzalez, 128 Hawai' i at 322, 288 
P.3d at 796 (quoting Commentary to HRS § 702–212.). Conviction of HAR § 13-261-10 results in “the possibility of imprisonment,” and therefore the imposition of strict liability is “indefensible in principle.” Id. 
Further, a legislative intent to impose strict
 
liability does not “plainly appear” from the relevant legislative
 history. The KIRC’s authority to enact HAR § 13-261-10 is
 derived from HRS § 6K-6. The penalties for violations of HAR § 
23
         
         
            
            
           
            
       
           
             
           
          
            
           
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
13-261-10 are imposed by HRS § 6K-8. Nothing in the legislative
 
history of either demonstrates that the legislature intended to
 allow the KIRC to enact absolute liability offenses. Hence, HAR
 § 13-261-10 does not impose absolute liability. 
B.
 
Because none of the exceptions in HRS § 702-212 apply,
 
under HRS § 702-204, the State was required to prove that
 individuals who violated HAR § 13-261-10 did so intentionally,
 knowingly, or recklessly. The complaints, however, did not
 specify that Petitioners act intentionally, knowingly, or
 recklessly. Therefore, the complaints did not allege the
 requisite state of mind.
20
 
This court “adhere[s] to th[e] core principle” that 
“[a] charge that fails to charge a requisite state of mind cannot be construed reasonably to state an offense and thus the charge is dismissed without prejudice because it violates due process.” Apollonio, 130 Hawai' i at 359, 311 P.3d at 682. This principle 
applies even if the sufficiency of the charge is not challenged 
20
 In its supplemental brief, the State concedes that the complaints
 
were defective because they did not allege the requisite state of mind with
respect to attempt. As recounted by the State, the complaints alleged that
 Petitioners “did enter or attempt to enter into” the reserve. (Emphasis
 
added.) However, to demonstrate that a defendant is guilty of attempt, the
State must demonstrate that, inter alia , the defendant
“intentionally engag[ed] in conduct which . . . constitutes a substantial step
in a course of conduct intended to culminate in the person’s commission of the
crime.” HRS § 705-500(1)(b) (1993) (emphasis added). Because the complaints
did not allege that Petitioners acted intentionally, the complaints did not
allege the required state of mind with respect to attempt. However, it is
noted that based on the stipulated facts, Petitioners did actually enter the
reserve, rather than just attempt to enter the reserve.
 
24
         
           
             
              
             
         
          
 
        
                
           
           
             
           
           
           
           
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
before the trial court.21 Id.; see also State v. Elliot, 77 
Hawai'i 309, 313, 884 P.3d 372, 276 (1994). Because the 
complaints omitted the requisite state of mind, the charges must 
be dismissed without prejudice.22 See Apollonio, 130 Hawai' i at 
359, 311 P.3d at 682. 
C.
 
Petitioners allege that the complaints should be
 
dismissed with prejudice because new charges would be time barred
 under the relevant statute of limitations. However, the statute
 of limitations has been tolled in this case. 
A violation of HAR § 13-261-10 is a petty misdemeanor. 
HRS § 701-107(4) (Supp. 2005) provides that “[a] crime is a petty
 misdemeanor . . . if it is defined by a statute other than this
 Code that provides that persons convicted thereof may be
 sentenced to imprisonment for a term not to exceed thirty days.” 
HAR § 13-261-5 (2002) provides that “(a) any person violating the
 rules in [HAR Chapter 261] shall be punished as provided in
 
21
 
The complaints in the instant case were filed on August 22, 2006
and August 28, 2006. The articulation of the “core principle” that a charge
must allege the requisite state of mind in Gonzalez and Apollonio was based on
this court’s decision in Nesmith , which was not filed until April 12, 2012.
Petitioners filed their Application on September 16, 2013. Therefore,
Petitioners could not have argued at trial that the complaints violated
Nesmith .
 
22
 In Apollonio , the defendant challenged the sufficiency of the 
charge for the first time on appeal. 130 Hawai 'i at 358, 311 P.3d at 681. In 
contrast, here Petitioners did not challenge the sufficiency of the charge atall. Nevertheless, the “core principle” announced in Apollonio , that a charge
that does not allege a state of mind does not “alert [] defendants ofprecisely what they need[] to defend against to avoid a conviction” and thereby violates due process, applies. Moreover, the State concedes that thedefects in the charge mandate dismissal without prejudice. Hence, it isappropriate for this court to dismiss the charge without prejudice based onthe failure to allege a state of mind. 
25
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
sections 6K-8 and 6K8.5, [HRS].” HRS § 6K-8 (Supp. 1997) states
 
that “[a]ny person who violates any of the laws or rules
 applicable to the island reserve shall be guilty of a petty
 misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned
 not more than thirty days, or both, for each offense.” 
The statute of limitations for a petty misdemeanor is
 
one year. HRS § 701-108(2)(f) (Supp. 2006) (“A prosecution for a
 petty misdemeanor or a violation other than a parking violation
 must be commenced within one year after it is committed.”) If
 this case were dismissed without prejudice, Petitioners maintain
 that the prosecution would be unable to re-file the charges,
 since more than one year has passed since Petitioners’ 2006 entry
 onto the Reserve. 
However, HRS § 701-108(6)(b) provides that “The period
 
of limitation does not run” “[d]uring any time when a prosecution
 against the accused for the same conduct is pending in this
 State[.]” The Commentary on HRS § 701-108(6) provides that
 “Subsection (6) . . . prevents any claim that the statute has run
 preventing retrial after reversal on appeal or dismissal for some
 reason which would not make retrial a matter of double jeopardy.”
 
HRS § 701-108(6) thus indicates that the statute of
 
limitations is tolled whenever “a prosecution against the accused
 for the same conduct is pending . . . .” (Emphasis added.) This
 would include the period of time during which the prosecution
 against Petitioners has been pending in the instant case. 
Despite the fact that the charge against Petitioners was
 
26
         
        
         
           
         
          
           
            
       
          
           ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
deficient, the prosecution was still “pending.”23 Thus, the
 
statute of limitations was tolled for the period beginning with
 
the prosecution’s filing of its Complaint in this action and
 ending when the court issues its judgment dismissing the case
 without prejudice. It is during this period that the prosecution
 can be considered to be “pending.” The incident in this case
 took place on July 31, 2006. The prosecution filed the Complaint
 on August 22, 2006. The prosecution has been pending since then. 
Thus, approximately one month has run on the statute of
 limitations. Therefore, the statute of limitations does not bar
 the prosecution from re-filing a complaint against Petitioners.
24
 
VI.
 
The issues raised by the Application have been briefed 
and the case will likely be retried on remand. See id. at *5 
(noting that this court would reach the defendant’s remaining arguments, because of the likelihood of retrial on remand); see also Gonzalez, 128 Hawai' i at 325, 288 P.3d at 799 (same). 
Because of the likelihood of retrial, we discuss the arguments raised. 
23
 Petitioners maintain that since the charge was deficient, the
 
prosecution was a “nullity” and therefore, the proceedings against Petitioners
 
cannot be considered “a prosecution” for purposes of HRS § 701-108(6).
However, despite the deficiency of the charging instrument, the proceedings
can themselves still be considered “a prosecution” against Petitioners. See
 
Black’s Law Dictionary 1341 (9th ed. 2009) (defining “prosecution” as (1) “The
 
commencement and carrying out of any action or scheme” and (2) “A criminal
 proceeding in which an accused person is tried.”).
 
24
 The cases cited by Petitioner are distinguishable in that they are
 
both from other jurisdictions and discuss the statue of limitations in civil
cases.

The KIRC was established pursuant to HRS § 6K-5 (Supp.
 
2000), with the intent that the KIRC “establish criteria,
 
policies, and controls for permissible uses within the island
 reserve[.]” The rules in Title 13, Chapter 261 of the HAR were
 promulgated pursuant to the KIRC’s statutory authority. See HRS
 
§ 6K-5(9). HRS § 13-261-1(b) (2002) provides that the purpose of
 the rules is to “manage, preserve, restore, and protect the
 natural and cultural resources of the reserve; to regulate
 activities within the reserve; and to protect public health and
 safety.” HRS § 13-261-1(b) states that “these rules shall apply
 to all persons entering the reserve.” To reiterate, HRS § 13­261-5 (2002) prescribes the penalties for a violation of Chapter
 261, specifically that “[a]ny person violating the rules in this
 chapter shall be punished as provided in [HRS] sections 6K-8[ 
25
 ]
 and 6K-8.5[ 26
][.]”
25 HRS § 6K-8 is quoted supra.
 
26 HRS § 6K-8.5 (Supp. 1997) provides, in relevant part, that:
 
(a) Except as otherwise provided by law, the commission is
authorized to set, charge, and collect administrative fines,
or bring legal action to recover administrative costs of the
commission or the department, or payment for damages, or for
the cost to correct damages resulting from a violation of
chapter 6K or any rule adopted thereunder. The
 administrative fines shall be as follows:
 
(1) For a first violation, by a fine of not more
than $10,000;
(2) For a second violation within five years of
a previous violation, by a fine of not more than
$15,000; and
(3) For a third or subsequent violation within
five years of the last violation, by a fine of
not more than $25,000.

28
         
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
As noted above, HAR § 13-261-10 sets forth the limits
 
for entry onto the reserve, only allowing entrance by a person or
 
vessel under specific, limited circumstances, which include when
 a person “[i]s specifically authorized to do so through written
 agreement approved by the commission[.]” To reiterate, HAR 13­261-11 details the process for obtaining approval by application
 to the KIRC. It states, inter alia, that “[e]ntrance into and
 activities within the reserve requested by applicants seeking to
 exercise traditional and customary rights and practices
 compatible with the law, shall be approved or disapproved by the
 commission after review and consultation with cultural
 practitioners[,]” and that “[p]rior to approving or disapproving
 any application, the commission shall determine whether the
 entrance and activities proposed by the application conform to
 the allowable activities described in § 13-261-13.” HAR § 13­261-11(c) and (f).
 
VIII.
 
Petitioners’ arguments in its Application appear to be
 
somewhat inconsistent with the questions presented. However, in
 the interest of fully considering the legal issues presented by
 this case, and giving due weight to the “argument” portion of
 Petitioners’ Application, their arguments are construed in the
 manner following. 
26...continue
 
(
Emphasis added.)
 
29
         
        
         
            
          
       
        
            
           
           
         
    ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
The first question would be whether the ICA erred when
 
it held that HAR §§ 13-261-10 and -1127 were constitutional. 
This question consists of three sub-issues, based on each of the
 
constitutional rights Petitioners allege were infringed by the
 regulations, (1) the right to form an indigenous nation, (2) the
 right to engage in traditional and customary practices, and (3)
 the right to practice religion. 
The second question would be whether the ICA improperly
 
rested its holding on subject matter jurisdiction rather than
 analyzing Petitioners’ “privilege” defense to penal liability,
 specifically that Petitioners were engaging in traditional and
 customary practices and therefore were not subject to liability
 under HAR § 13-261-10.
28
 
IX.
 
For analytical purposes, this second question, 
regarding Petitioner’s “privilege” defense is addressed first, inasmuch as it resolves whether Petitioners should have been subject to penal liability under HAR § 13-261-10 in the first place. See City and Cnty. of Honolulu v. Sherman, 110 Hawai' i 
39, 56 n.7, 129 P.3d 542, 559 n.7 (2006) (“A fundamental and 
27
 In their first question presented, quoted supra, Petitioners only
 
challenge the constitutionality of HAR § 13-261-11. However, Petitioners
arguments on this point appear to address the constitutionality of HAR § 13­261-10, which incorporates HAR § 13-261-11 by reference. Thus, the
constitutionality of both regulations, operating together, is addressed.
 
28
 In their second question presented, quoted supra, Petitioners ask
 
whether the ICA failed to analyze HAR § 13-261-11 in light of fundamental
rights, instead of deciding the case based on subject matter jurisdiction.
This question overlaps with their first question, but the arguments section of
Petitioners’ Application raises different points, which appear related to the
 “privilege” defense.
 
30
         
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
longstanding principle of judicial restraint requires that courts
 
avoid reaching constitutional questions in the advance of
 deciding them.” (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).
 
A.
 
First, it is clear that there was sufficient evidence 
adduced at trial to sustain Petitioners’ conviction. “‘[T]he test on appeal in reviewing the legal sufficiency of the evidence is whether, when viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, substantial evidence exists to support the conclusion of the trier of fact.’” State v. Agard, 113 Hawai' i 
321, 324, 151 P.3d 802, 805 (2007) (quoting State v. Bui, 104 Hawai'i 462, 467, 92 P.3d 471, 476 (2004)) (other citation 
omitted). 
The elements of the offense in the instant case are (1)
 
entering or attempting to enter into or remain, (2) within the
 Reserve, (3) without authorization as enumerated in HAR § 13-261­10(a)-(d). See HAR § 13-261-10. Since the state of mind for
 
this petty misdemeanor is not established in the regulation, each
 element is established if the defendant acts intentionally,
 knowingly, or recklessly. See discussion, supra. As explained
 
supra, Petitioners stipulated that (1) they entered the reserve,
 (2) they were not specifically authorized to enter into or remain
 on the reserve, (3) they did not make a written application for
 authorization to the commission (HAR § 13-261-10(b)), (4) they
 were not trolling in zone B (HAR § 13-261-10(c)), and (5) they 
31
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
did not enter the reserve to prevent probable loss of vessel or
 
human life (HAR § 13-261-10(d)). 
All of these elements were established with the 
requisite intent of intentionally or knowingly, as evidenced by the court’s finding no. 1, stating that Petitioners traveled to the Reserve “for purposes of exercising and proclaiming the Reinstated Kingdom’s property rights in the Kaho' olawe Island 
Reserve and its adjacent waters[,]” and finding no. 8, that Petitioners “intentionally chose to ignore and disregard the written application process . . . .” Thus, via stipulation, the prosecution established each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. Petitioners’ defense that the privilege for native Hawaiian practices applies in this case may be considered in this context. 
B.
 
As noted, the right to engage in traditional and 
customary Native Hawaiian practices is recognized under the Hawai'i Constitution art. XII, section 7. Pursuant to Hanapi, 
this court established a three-part test for “a defendant to establish that his or her conduct is constitutionally protected as a native Hawaiian right.” 89 Hawai' i at 185-86, 970 P.2d at 
493-94. First, the defendant must qualify as a ‘native Hawaiian’ within the guidelines set out in PASH. Id. at 185, 970 P.2d at 
494. Second, the defendant “must establish that his or her
 
claimed right is constitutionally protected as a native Hawaiian
 practice.” Id. Third, the defendant “must also prove that the
 
32
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
exercise of the right occurred on undeveloped or ‘less than fully
 
developed property.’” Id. 
The court’s findings nos. 21 and 22, which are 
unchallenged by the parties, show that Petitioners satisfied the first requirement and the third requirement. As to the second requirement, it is not clear whether managing and controlling Kaho'olawe is a customary and traditional native Hawaiian 
practice within the meaning of the Hawai' i Constitution, or that 
the religious practices Petitioners discuss in their testimony satisfy this standard. However, assuming, arguendo, that these activities do constitute constitutionally protected practices, Petitioners have satisfied the Hanapi test. 
Under the “privilege defense,” a balancing test is then 
applied to determine whether Petitioners’ assertion of the native Hawaiian privilege will negate the conviction. Pratt, 127 
Hawai'i at 216, 277 P.3d at 310. It must be determined whether 
Petitioners’ conduct was reasonable, by balancing the State’s interests in regulating Petitioners’ activity with Petitioners’ interest in visiting Kaho' olawe. See Pratt, 127 Hawai' i at 218, 
277 P.3d at 312. 
At the hearing on the Motion to Dismiss, the State 
explained that HAR chapter 261 relating to the Kaho' olawe Island 
Reserve “is in effect and enforced because of the threat to public health and safety that the Island and the waters of Kaho'olawe possess.” It quoted that portion of the historical 
note to HAR chapter 13-261, which states that “institutional 
33
         
 
             
           
         
       
         
            
        
        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
controls are required because of the imminent threat to public 
health and safety which will continue to exist until the Kaho'olawe Island Reserve has been cleared of unexploded ordnance 
and hazardous waste.” Next, the State articulated that it “take[s] all access participants very seriously when they go to the Island because of all of the health and safety concerns that are still present on the Island and its surrounding waters.” Thus, the record indicates that HAR § 13-261-10 is intended to limit the exposure of individuals to potential safety hazards in the Reserve. 
On the other hand, Petitioners testified that they 
visited Kaho' olawe with the purpose of reestablishing the 
Reinstated Hawaiian Government. They testified as follows: 
Q. And . . . the right you went there to exercise, am I
correct, that that was the right to claim the -- you were
only at that point on that exercise claiming the limited
right to claim management and control of Kaho 'olawe? 
A. That’s correct . And, of course, I felt even stronger
 
than that, you know. I believe that that also -- that we
 extended that exercise believing that we are going to
initiate now the claims, you know, to Kaho 'olawe. 
(Emphases added.)
 
Again assuming, arguendo, that Petitioners can
 
establish that they were engaging in a traditional and customary
 
native Hawaiian practice, their interest must be balanced against
 the State’s interest to determine whether Petitioners are subject
 to penal liability in the instant case. In Pratt, after setting
 forth the interests of each party, the majority noted that
 “[w]hile Pratt has a strong interest in visiting [the restricted 
34
          ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
area], he did not attempt to visit in accordance with the laws of 
the State.” 127 Hawai' i at 218, 277 P.3d at 312. 
In this case, Petitioners similarly made no attempt to 
avail themselves of the applicable procedures to obtain lawful entry into the Reserve. Here, the regulations established a clear method for lawful entry onto the Reserve and Petitioners made no showing that they would have been denied entry had they applied under HAR § 13-261-11. Under these circumstances, Petitioners did not “reasonably exercise[]” their constitutionally protected native Hawaiian rights, see Hanapi, 89 Hawai'i at 184, 970 P.2d at 493, because they did not apply for 
authorization from the commission. Therefore, the balance weighs in favor of the State’s interest in protecting the health and safety of those individuals who travel to Kaho' olawe. 
Petitioners’ activities then do not fall within a haven protecting them from criminal liability. 
C.
 
As part of this point of error, Petitioners also allege
 
that the ICA incorrectly deemed their argument to be about
 whether the court had jurisdiction. Petitioners are correct that
 the ICA did consider whether the court had subject matter
 jurisdiction. Armitage, 2013 WL 1829663, at *2. However, the
 
ICA additionally considered Petitioners’ assertion of the
 privilege defense in Section II.B. of its SDO. Id. at *3. Thus,
 
Petitioners cannot successfully argue that the ICA based its 
35
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
decision solely on subject matter jurisdiction rather than on the
 
privilege defense.
 
X.
 
Next, Petitioners’ point of error alleging
 
constitutional claims is addressed. Specifically, Petitioners
 challenge the constitutionality of the regulations in HAR chapter
 13-261. 
The preliminary issue is whether Petitioners have 
standing to challenge the constitutionality of the HAR chapter 13-261 regulations. Although not explicitly argued by the parties, this court must consider the issue of standing sua sponte, because “‘[a] plaintiff without standing is not entitled to invoke a court’s jurisdiction.’” Sierra Club v. Hawai' i 
Tourism Authority ex rel. Bd. of Directors, 100 Hawai' i 242, 59 
P.3d 877 (2002) (quoting Mottl v. Miyahira, 95 Hawai' i 381, 388, 
23 P.3d 716, 723 (2001)) (other citation omitted). 
Because Petitioners were subject to penal liability
 
pursuant to HAR § 13-261-10, they have “a claim of specific
 present objective harm”, Ariyoshi, 67 Haw. at 419, 689 P.2d at
 765, and therefore have standing to challenge the
 constitutionality of that regulation. This much is clear. On
 the other hand, Petitioners stipulated at trial that they “did
 not make a written application to the commission for the
 authorization of entrance into and activity within the reserve.” 
This stipulation establishes that Petitioners did not attempt to
 follow the procedures set forth in HAR § 13-261-11 to obtain
 
36
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
lawful entry into the Reserve; Petitioners thus may not have
 
standing to argue that HAR § 13-261-11 is unconstitutional.
 
The general rule is that “[w]here restraints imposed 
act directly on an individual or entity and a claim of specific present objective harm is presented, standing to challenge the constitutionality of an ordinance or statute exists.” State v. 
Bloss, 64 Haw. 148, 151, 637 P.2d 1117, 1121 (1981), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 824 (1982) (citing Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U.S. 809 (1975)) (other citation omitted). This standing requirement is termed the “rule against vicarious assertion of constitutional rights.” Tauese v. State, Dep’t of Labor & Indus. Relations, 113 
Hawai'i 1, 28, 147 P.3d 785, 812 (2006). “One must show that as 
applied to him the statute is constitutionally invalid.” Ariyoshi, 67 Haw. at 419, 689 P.2d at 765 (citing State v. Marley, 54 Haw. 450, 509 P.2d 1095 (1973)). Thus, for example, a criminal defendant cannot challenge the constitutionality of one subsection of a statute where he was charged under a different subsection. State v. O’Brien, 5 Haw. App. 491, 494, 704 P.2d 
905, 909, aff’d, 68 Haw. 38, 704 P.2d 883 (1985). 
To the extent that Petitioners challenge HAR § 13-261­
11 as unconstitutional, Petitioners would lack standing to do so,
 inasmuch as they never followed the prescribed procedures, and
 thus were not subject to HAR § 13-216-11. Since they never
 attempted to use the application procedure, they cannot claim
 that the specifics of the application procedures under HAR § 13­
37
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
216-11, including review by a “cultural practitioner,” HAR § 13­
216-11(f), are unconstitutional as applied to them. 
However, there is an exception for bringing 
constitutional challenges in the First Amendment area, pursuant to the overbreadth doctrine. See Tauese, 113 Hawai' i at 28, 147 
P.3d at 812. That doctrine allows a party whose own rights are not violated to challenge the constitutionality of an ordinance upon showing that it abridges the protected speech of persons not before the court. State v. Bloss, 64 Haw. 148, 151 n.6, 637 P.2d 
1117, 1121 n.6 (1981). Although Petitioners assert First Amendment rights, specifically, the right to practice their religion, as explained infra, their actions do not constitute “protected speech.” Therefore, this exception is not available to Petitioners to challenge to the constitutionality of HAR § 13­216-11. 
Petitioners constitutional arguments are therefore
 
limited to the constitutionality of HAR § 13-216-10, because they
 cannot demonstrate a “specific present objective harm” based on
 HAR § 13-261-11. Had Petitioners attempted to follow the
 application process, then they would have had standing to
 challenge the constitutionality of HAR § 13-261-11. However,
 those are not the facts presented by this case. Thus,
 Petitioner’s challenge is limited to HAR § 13-261-10. 
Nevertheless, the process set forth in HAR § 13-261-11 will be
 addressed where necessarily implicated in the analysis that
 follows.
 
38
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
XI.
 
As to the merits of their constitutional claims, to
 
reiterate, Petitioners apparently argue that HAR § 13-261-10, the
 
regulation they were charged with violating, is unconstitutional
 for three reasons. To repeat, they maintain that HAR § 13-261-10
 abridged their fundamental rights to (1) form an indigenous
 nation; (2) engage in traditional and customary practices; and
 (3) practice their religion. According to Petitioners, their
 right to enter the Reserve to exercise fundamental rights cannot
 “constitutionally be subject to an undefined review by undefined
 cultural practitioners[.]”
 
“‘[T]his court reviews questions of constitutional law 
de novo, under the “right/wrong” standard, and thus, exercises its own independent constitutional judgment based on the facts of the case.’” Kaho'ohanohano v. State, 114 Hawai' i 302, 339, 162 
P.3d 696, 733 (2007) (quoting In re Guardianship of Carlsmith, 113 Hawai' i 236, 239, 151 P.3d 717, 720 (2007) (other citation 
omitted)). Furthermore, this court has “long recognized that the Hawai'i Constitution must be construed with due regard to the 
intent of the framers and the people adopting it, and the fundamental principle in interpreting a constitutional principle is to give effect to that intent.’” Id. (quoting Save Sunset 
Beach Coal. v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 102 Hawai' i 465, 474, 78 
P.3d 1, 10 (2003) (other citation omitted)). 
A.
 
First, Petitioners allege that their right to form an
 
39
         
       
       
        
          
         
        
         
        
           ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
indigenous nation was abridged. Petitioners maintain that the 
right of the Native Hawaiian people to reestablish an autonomous sovereign government is a fundamental right. While the Hawai' i 
State Legislature has in the past recognized the potential for a sovereign native Hawaiian government to be recognized, see, 
29
 , Petitioners
 e.g., 1994 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 200, § 1 at 479 fail to establish that the right to form a sovereign native
 Hawaiian nation is a “fundamental right.”
 
In their Application, Petitioners rely on Gates’ 
testimony that the process of building an indigenous native Hawaiian Nation is constitutionally protected under Article XII, section 7 of the Hawai' i Constitution. 
However, Article XII 
offers protection for “all rights, customarily and traditionally exercised for subsistence, cultural and religious purposes . . . .” This constitutional provision has never been extended beyond rights deemed to have been “customarily and traditionally” practiced by native Hawaiians. Art. XII, section 7 does not create a separate, additional right to nation-building, as Petitioners appear to contend. 
29
 Act 200, section 1 provided, in part, that:
 
SECTION 1. Findings. The legislature through Act 359,
Session Laws of Hawai 'i 1993, recognized the unique status
that the native Hawaiian people bear to the State of Hawai 'i 
and to the United States. The Hawaiian sovereignty advisorycommission was established to seek counsel from the native Hawaiian people on how to facilitate the efforts to be
governed by an indigenous sovereign nation of their ownchoosing . 
1994 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 200, § 1 at 479 (emphasis added).
 
40
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Moreover, Petitioners’ theory of nation-building as a 
fundamental right under the ICA’s decision in Lorenzo does not 
appear viable. Lorenzo held that, for jurisdictional purposes, 
should a defendant demonstrate a factual or legal basis that the Kingdom of Hawai' i “exists as a state in accordance with 
recognized attributes of a state’s sovereign nature[,]” and that he or she is a citizen of that sovereign state, a defendant may be able to argue that the courts of the State of Hawai' i lack 
jurisdiction over him or her. 77 Hawai' i at 221, 883 P.2d at 
644. Thus, Lorenzo does not recognize a fundamental right to
 
build a sovereign Hawaiian nation. Further, it does not set
 forth the process for the creation of a sovereign Hawaiian
 nation, but only indicates that this State’s courts would be
 amenable to an argument that they lack jurisdiction over certain
 individuals subject to a new sovereign nation, in the event that
 such a sovereign nation was recognized by the United States
 government and internationally. See id.
 
Finally, Petitioners fail to establish that 1993 U.S.
 
Public Law 103 (the “Apology Resolution”) created a “fundamental
 right.” Petitioners do not cite to the text of the Apology
 Resolution or any other references in support of their assertion. 
In 1993, Congress adopted the Apology Resolution to acknowledge
 and “express its deep regret” for the United States’ active role
 in the illegal overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in the late
 nineteenth century, while disclaiming that the resolution was
 “intended to serve as a settlement of any claims against the
 
41
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
United States.” P.L. 103-150, 107 Stat. 1510 (1993). In Office 
of Hawaiian Affairs v. HCDCH, 117 Hawai' i 174, 177 P.3d 884 
(2008), this court held that the Apology Bill gave rise to the State’s fiduciary duty to preserve ceded lands in trust, until such time as the unrelinquished claims of the native Hawaiians were resolved. 117 Hawai' i at 195, 177 P.3d at 905. The U.S. 
Supreme Court reversed this court, holding that the Apology Resolution did not confer substantive rights or have a substantive legal effect. Hawai'i v. Office of Hawaiian Affairs, 
556 U.S. 163, 164 (2009). Thus, the Apology Bill cannot serve to support a fundamental right to nation-building, as Petitioners allege. 
B.
 
An alternative construction of Petitioners’ alleged
 
sovereign nation-building right would be to construe it within
 the constitutional right to freedom of speech. Although
 Petitioners do not explicitly state that this is a freedom of
 speech claim, they cite to numerous cases where freedom of speech
 was at issue, including making arguments related to “prior
 restraints” and “[s]ymbolic expression.” 
On this issue, the court properly decided in conclusion 
no. 14 that Petitioners’ “purpose to claim and manage, control and subsequently occupy Kaho' olawe involved conduct outside the 
scope of any first amendment right to freedom of speech.” (Emphasis added.) In this case, Petitioners adduced evidence on their Motion to Dismiss that managing and controlling Kaho' olawe 
42
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
was an important part of exercising their sovereignty, and that
 
they sought recognition as the sovereign native Hawaiian entity. 
However, Petitioners’ actions do not necessarily amount to
 “speech”. 
Several Hawai' i cases support this conclusion. In 
State v. Jim, 105 Hawai' i 319, 97 P.3d 395 (App. 2004), for 
example, the defendant claimed that his physical presence preventing county water supply workers from investigating an illegal water line was a protest. 105 Hawai' i at 326, 97 P.3d at 
402. The ICA held that the defendant’s conduct, physically
 
obstructing lawful work, did not constitute speech for which
 first amendment protections were available. Id. at 334, 97 P.3d
 
at 410. 
In Kleinjans v. Lombardi, 52 Haw. 427, 478 P.2d 320
 
(1970), this court considered the propriety of an injunction
 prohibiting certain forms of student demonstrations, specifically
 occupation of the university chancellor’s office. 52 Haw. at
 428, 478 P.2d at 322. Kleinjans held that by occupying the
 
university office, the defendants were engaged in conduct that
 did not constitute speech because, “[t]heir protest did not take
 the form of a public rally but instead involved the occupation of
 the private office of a university official. There could not be
 any good faith claim that this area was open to the public for
 the purpose of expressing dissident ideas.” Id. at 433, 478 P.2d
 
at 324. 
43
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Similarly, here, Petitioners cannot claim that the 
Reserve was an area “open to the public for expression of ideas.” 
Id. Thus, although to some extent Petitioners apparently 
intended to communicate through their presence on Kaho' olawe, it 
cannot be deemed “speech” for purposes of the First Amendment freedom of speech protections. See United States v. O’Brien, 391 
U.S. 367, 376 (1968) (“We cannot accept the view that an
 apparently limitless variety of conduct can be labeled ‘speech’
 whenever the person engaging in the conduct intends thereby to
 express an idea.”). Therefore, Petitioners’ claim that the
 regulations unconstitutionally abridged their right to establish
 a sovereign nation is incorrect.
 
XII. 
Second, Petitioners argue abridgment of their 
constitutional right under the Hawai' i Constitution to engage in 
traditional and customary native Hawaiian practices. This right is unique to this State, and therefore an alleged abridgment of this right is analyzed under Hawai' i’s jurisprudence. See, e.g., 
Ka Pa'akai O Ka' Aina v. Land Use Comm’n, 94 Hawai 'i 31, 7 P.3d 
1068, 1083 (2000) (“‘[T]he State is obligated to protect the reasonable exercise of customarily and traditionally exercised rights of Hawaiians to the extent feasible.’”) (emphasis omitted) (quoting PASH, 79 Hawai' i at 450 n.43, 903 P.2d at 1271 n.43). 
This court has constructed the right to engage in
 
traditional and customary native Hawaiian practices as “an
 attempt on the part of the framers of [HRS § 1-1] to avoid
 
44
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
results inappropriate to the isles’ inhabitants by permitting the 
continuance of native understandings and practices which did not unreasonably interfere with the spirit of the common law.” Kalipi v. Hawaiian Trust Co., 66 Haw. 1, 10, 656 P.2d 745, 751 (1982). Kalipi further stated that “the retention of a Hawaiian 
tradition should in each case be determined by balancing the respective interests and harm once it is established that the application of the custom has continued in a particular area.” Id. Accordingly, in Ka Pa' akai O Ka' Aina, it was held that the 
State and its agencies “may not act without independently considering the effect of their actions on Hawaiian traditions and practices.” 94 Hawai' i at 46, 7 P.3d at 1083. 
In this case, the KIRC did consider the effect of its
 
actions on Hawaiian traditions and practices when it promulgated
 HAR §§ 13-261-10 and -11. This consideration is apparent in the
 exception in HAR §§ 13-261-10 and -11 specifically mentioning
 “[e]ntrance into and activities within the reserve requested by
 applicants seeking to exercise traditional and customary rights
 and practices compatible with the law[.]” HAR § 13-261-11. 
Further, as discussed supra, with respect to Petitioners’
 “privilege defense,” the State’s interest as balanced against the
 potential harm to Petitioners’ ability to engage in native
 Hawaiian traditional and customary practices weighs in favor of
 the State. As a result, Petitioners cannot claim that HAR §§ 13­261-10 or -11 is unconstitutional on this basis.
 
45
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
XIII.
 
Third, Petitioners state that their right to practice
 
religion was infringed by the subject regulations. This argument
 
may be analyzed under the framework of the free exercise clause. 
See U.S. Const. amend. I (“Congress shall make no law respecting
 an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise
 thereof[.]”); Haw. Const. art. I, § 4 (“No law shall be enacted
 respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free
 exercise thereof[.]”). 
A.
 
In State v. Sunderland, 115 Hawai' i 396, 168 P.3d 526 
(2007), this court discussed at length challenges to laws on the grounds that they violate the constitutional right to free exercise of religion. 115 Hawai' i at 401-404, 168 P.3d at 531­
534. It was concluded that, in accordance with the U.S. Supreme 
Court’s decision in Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990), “a generally applicable law is not subject to First Amendment attack unless (1) it interferes with ‘the Free Exercise Clause in conjunction with other constitutional protections,’ or (2) it creates a mechanism that calls for ‘individualized governmental assessment of the reasons for the relevant conduct[]’ (i.e., individualized exemptions).” 
Sunderland, 115 Hawai' i at 404, 168 P.3d at 534 (emphases added) 
(quoting Smith, 494 U.S. at 884). Sunderland held that the 
criminal statute making it an offense to knowingly possess marijuana, HRS § 712-1249 (1993), was generally applicable, and 
46
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
therefore, following Smith, was not subject to a First Amendment
 
attack. Id.
 
In this case, although HAR § 13-261-10 initially seems
 
like a “generally applicable law”, similar to the generally
 applicable criminal statute that was at issue in Sunderland, the
 regulation also appears to “create[] a mechanism that calls for
 individualized government assessment of the reasons for the
 relevant conduct,” id. (internal quotation marks and citations
 omitted), through its reference to HAR § 13-261-11. To
 reiterate, HAR § 13-261-10(a) states that entrance to the reserve
 is not permitted unless “specifically authorized” and that the
 process for that authorization is set forth in HAR § 13-261-11. 
Although, as noted, Petitioners lack standing to directly
 challenge the constitutionality of HAR § 13-261-11, the language
 from Sunderland states that Smith will apply unless the law
 “creates” a mechanism for individualized assessment. Id.
 
(emphasis added). A mechanism is “created” via HAR § 13-261-11
 for the KIRC to individually assess whether to allow a person or
 group to enter the Reserve.
 
Where there is an individualized assessment, as in this
 
case, then the U.S. Supreme Court’s test set forth in Sherbert v.
 Verner, 374 U.S. 398 (1963), is applicable. See Smith, 494 U.S.
 
at 884 (“The Sherbert test . . . was developed in a context that
 lent itself to individualized government assessment of the
 reasons for the relevant conduct.”). Under the Sherbert test, if
 a particular law imposes a burden upon the free exercise of
 
47
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
religion, judicial scrutiny is triggered, the regulation must be
 
justified with a compelling government interest, and the
 government has the burden of demonstrating “that no alternative
 forms of regulation would combat such abuses without infringing
 First Amendment rights.” Id. at 404-407.
 
To the extent that Petitioners and the State argue that 
various other presumptions should apply with respect to determining the constitutionality of the regulation, it is noted that under the circumstances presented by this case, the Sherbert test is consistent with the general proposition advanced by Petitioners, and articulated in Child Support Enforcement Agency, quoted supra. That proposition is that the presumption of statutory constitutionality does not apply to laws that classify on the basis of suspect categories or impinge on fundamental rights expressly or impliedly granted by the constitution. Child 
Support Enforcement Agency, 109 Hawai' i at 246, 125 P.3d at 467 
(citation omitted). “Such laws are presumed to be unconstitutional unless the state shows compelling state interests which justify such classifications, and that the laws are narrowly drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgments of constitutional rights.” Id. (emphasis in original) (citing Baehr 
v. Lewin, 74 Haw. 530, 571-72, 852 P.2d 44, 63-64 (1993)) (other
 citations omitted). This description of the constitutional
 strict scrutiny test is consistent with the test applied by the
 U.S. Supreme Court in Sherbert. See Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 404­
407.
 
48
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
B.
 
In applying the strict scrutiny analysis, the first
 
question is whether HAR § 13-261-10 burdened the free exercise of
 
religion. On this point, the court concluded that Petitioners
 “did not prove their deprivation of a right to free exercise of
 religion, because their testimony and evidence failed to
 establish ‘that such practice is an integral part of a religious
 faith and that the prohibition . . . results in a virtual
 inhibition of the religion or the practice of the faith.”
 (Emphasis in original.) (Quoting Blake, 5 Haw. App. at 417, 695
 P.2d at 340 (citation omitted).)
 
It is initially observed that this standard from Blake
 
cited in the court’s conclusions is not applicable to determining
 whether HAR § 13-261-10 burdened Petitioners’ exercise of
 religion. Specifically, Petitioners need not show that the
 regulation resulted in “a virtual inhibition of the religion or
 practice of the faith.” Blake, 5 Haw. App. at 417, 695 P.2d at
 
340. In Blake, the ICA adopted this standard from a California
 
Court of Appeal case, People v. Mullins, 123 Cal.Rptr. 201
 (1975), which considered the constitutionality of a generally
 applicable regulation. The Mullins court interpreted the first
 step in the Sherbert test to require two separate determinations
 -- first, whether “the statute imposes any burden upon the free
 exercise of the religion whose religious beliefs the defendant
 asserts he embraces and [second,] whether the defendant actually
 engaged in good faith in that religion.” 123 Cal.Rptr. at 207. 
49
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Mullins went on to state that “we note, here, that where it is
 
claimed that the use of a narcotic, drug or an hallucinogen which
 the state proscribes is a religious practice, it must be
 established that such practice is an integral part of a religious
 faith and that the prohibition of the narcotic, drug, or
 hallucinogen results in a virtual inhibition of the religion or
 practice of the faith.” Id. (emphases added). Thus, the
 
“integral part” and “virtual inhibition of the religion or
 practice of the faith” requirements were limited to cases where
 the use of a regulated or prohibited narcotic, drug or
 hallucinogen was at issue. See id. Blake properly applied these
 
requirements because in Blake, the defendant claimed that the use
 of marijuana was a religious practice. 5 Haw. App. at 417, 695
 P.2d 336. However, in this case, there is no claim of a use of a
 narcotic, drug, or hallucinogen, and thus the standards from
 Blake cited by the court in its conclusion no. 19 are not
 applicable.
 
Instead, this court has held that “‘it [is] necessary
 
to examine whether or not the activity interfered with by the
 state was motivated and rooted in a legitimate and sincerely held
 religious belief [and] whether or not the parties’ free exercise
 of religion had been burdened by the regulation[.]’” Dedman v.
 
Bd. of Land & Natural Res., 69 Haw. 255, 260, 740 P.2d 28, 32
 (1987) (quoting State ex rel. Minami v. Andrews, 65 Haw. 289,
 291, 651 P.2d 473, 474 (1982)). In this case, the legitimacy of
 
50
         
 
        
    
      
          
        
           
          
        
         
          
         
           
       ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Petitioners’ religious belief need not be addressed.30 
Similarly, it may be assumed that Petitioners’ activity was 
rooted in a legitimate and sincerely held belief. However, it appears that Petitioners cannot show that their free exercise of religion was burdened by HAR § 13-261-10. Despite Petitioners’ argument in their brief that they traveled to Kaho' olawe “to 
allow representatives of the Reinstated Hawaiian Government to build a heiau and perform a prayer on the site,” among other things, the record does not support a conclusion that Petitioners’ exercise of religion was burdened by the limitations imposed by the government on travel to Kaho' olawe. 
First, a review of the record suggests that Petitioners 
engaged in religious practices as part of their purpose of managing and controlling Kaho' olawe and/or establishing a native 
Hawaiian sovereign entity, but that such practices did not have to take place on Kaho' olawe as part of the practice of their 
religion. Noa testified that Petitioners had planned to undertake a religious ceremony on Kaho' olawe in connection with 
30 With respect to his religion, Noa testified as follows:
 
[Counsel  for  Petitioners]: 
Do you also practice a
 
religion?
 
[Noa]: 
You know, that’s an interesting point, yeah, 
religion. And in Hawai 'i, I think if you recognize our
Constitutions in the Kingdom, it basically said that every
man, person, could practice his own religion. Okay. So as far as Hawai 'i having, I guess you could say a central
religion, yeah, I think that it evolved through theconstitutions. And I thought that was quite amenable onbehalf of our monarchs to make that happen in Hawai 'i. 
Because prior to that there was definitely a religion thatwas practiced in Hawai 'i, and it was called the Kaku system.
And that in itself was religious practice.

their presence on the Reserve, as follows:
 
[Noa]: And we went [to Kaho 'o lawe], again,
u
nderstanding that our intent is to be recognized, yeah, who
we are as a people, as a nation, to exercise our right as a
nation.
 
[Counsel  for  Petitioners]:   Okay.   And  that  -­
the  right  you  went  there  to  exercise,  am  I  correct,
that  that  was  the  right  to  claim  the  -- you  were  only
at  that  point  on  that  exercise  claiming  the  limited
right  to  claim  management  and  control  of  Kaho'olawe? 
[Noa]:   That’s  correct.   And,  of  course,  I  felt  even 
stronger  than  that,  you  know.   I  believe  that  that  also  -­
that  we  extended  that  exercise  believing  that  we  are  going
to  initiate  now  the  claims,  you  know,  to  Kaho'olawe.   
[Counsel  for  Petitioners]:    Right.
 
And  when  you  got  there,  did  you  undertake  any  sort  of
a  religious  endeavor  or  ceremony?
 
[Noa]:   In  our  traditional  practice,  in  our
 
culture,  it  is  -- it  is  well  understood  that  when  you  have
an  event,  be  it  a  small  event  or  a  large  event,  you  always
pay  respect,  okay,  to  your  ancestors,  to  your  various  Gods
that  our  religion  has,  or  even  just  to  Akua  itself.
So  when  we  -- before  we  left,  we  already  had  a  plan
that  we  would  institute  protocol.   And  a  part  of  protocol  is
to  ask,  yeah,  our  ancestors  to  welcome  us  to  the  islands,
and  we  do  that  through  prayer.   And  that’s  what  we  did  when
 
we  arrived,  okay.   And  a  part  of  our  -- a  part  of  our
traditional  protocol  in  our  case,  because  we  are  a  nation
that’s  coming  into  being,  we  had  already  decided  that  we
would  build  an  ahu  to  signify  our  arrival ,  our  arrival,  our
accomplishment.
 
[Counsel  for  Petitioners]:  
And, for the record, what
 
is an “ahu”?
 
[Noa]: An  “ahu”  is  an  altar.   Okay.   You  can  have
 
personal  ahus,  you  can  have  community  ahus,  and  you  can  have
national  ahus.   Okay.   Some  of  the  national  ahus  are
 
referred  to  as  hales.
 
But,  this  is,  like  I  said,  a  sacred  place.   This  is
 
where  you  reveal  your  sincerity,  you  invoke  support  from
your  ama  kuas,  from  your  ancestors.   This  is  where  you  come
 
to  give  thanksgiving  to  provide  ho'okupu. 
[Counsel  for  Petitioners]:  And  was  there,  among
either  just  you  or  collectively,  was  there  a  religious
calling  to  do  this  when  you  got  there,  or  -­
[Noa]: Most  definitely.   I  mean,  it’s  a  part  of
 
us.   You  know,  when  you  lose  an  identity,  you  lose  a  nation,
you  lose  who  you  are.   So  to  maintain  that,  you  have  only
 
the  spirit,  you  know.   You  can  look  at  me  physically,  but  if
I  don’t  have  a  country,  hell,  I  believe  -- excuse  my
 
language,  I  believe  that  -- I’m  not  here.   Spiritually  I’m
here,  but  physically  I  have  to  be  reconnected  back  to  my
country.   Who  am  I?  I  am  a  Hawaiian.   I’m  a  Kanaka  maoli,
 
52
         
          
             
             
           
          
          
         
       
          
         
      
      
       
         
           
       
 I ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Native Hawaiian, and today I cannot claim that. You know,
so I have to design, you have to build our nation so that we
can fix that problem. It’s a problem that we live with.
 don’t care who you are as a Kanaka, you have that problem,
and that is you cannot claim sovereignty in your own country
until you fulfill that obligation. And, I mean, I believe
we have Kanakas sitting right here in this courtroom who
truly believe that we will never acquire independence.
You  know,  that’s  something  that  I  live  with,  I
understand,  but  they  need  to  respect  what  we  believe  in,  and
that’s  what  we  do.
 
[Counsel  for  Petitioners]: Now,  I  w
 ant  to  get  back
to  this  ceremony  for  a  moment,  the  religious  ceremony  on  the
island.
 
Yo
u have talked about our religion, and to -- in your
 
knowledge and understanding, was that a -- I think you
mentioned a traditional and customary religious ceremony ?
 
[Noa]: You know, it is a customary practice ,
okay.
 
[Counsel  for  Petitioners]: Okay.   And  prior  to
1893,  do  you  believe  that  was  practiced  on  the  Island  of
Kaho'olawe? 
[Noa]: Most  c ertainly.
 
[Counsel  f or  Petitioners]: That  t ype  of  ceremony?
 
[Noa]: Definitely.   There  are  ahus  set  on  the
 
island.   Personally  I  have  not  seen  those,  but  I  have  been
shown  myself.   I’ve  been  shown  photographs.   They  even  have
 
-- Kaho'olawe  also  represents,  this  is  -- forgive  me  for  not 
remembering,  but  there  is  a  point  on  Kaho'olawe  that  all  the 
navigators,  yeah,  that  sail  in  the  Pacific  from  Hawai'i  go 
back  to  the  Pacific  will  go  to  Kaho'olawe  and  they  will 
arrive.   Kealaikahiki  is  a  channel,  and  there  is  point  on
 
Kaho'olawe,  and  that  point  is  a  heiau,  it  has  an  ahu  that
was  built  centuries  ago,  and  that’s  for  our  sailing
purposes,  our  navigators,  you  know.   They  would  go  there  and
 
offer  up  their  ho'okupus,  their  services,  so  they  would
receive  protection,  the  strength  that  they  would  need.   And
 
the  island  has  many,  many  altars.
 
. . . .
 
[
Counsel  for  Petitioners]:   W hen  you  went  to
 
Kaho'olawe,  did  you  go  there  as  an  individual  with  the
intention  of  breaking  some  state  regulation,  or  did  you  go
there  primarily  for  the  purposes  that  you’ve  testified  to
today?
 
[Noa]: N
o. We went there primarily for the
purposes that I speak about today, that once we fulfilled
our obligation as a nation, I truly believe that it is now
the nation’s responsibility to exercise, you know, that
sovereign powers .
 
(Emphases added.)
 
53
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
While the foregoing testimony may establish that 
Petitioners were engaging in customary and traditional practices 
on the island, including religious practices, the testimony indicates that the practices were in connection with Petitioners’ sovereign nation-building activity. For example, Noa testified that “when you have an event” you undertake certain activities, and that “as part of our protocol” “because we are a nation that’s coming into being, we had already decided that we would build an ahu to signify our arrival.” (Emphasis added.) Noa further testified that there are many altars on Kaho' olawe, but 
he did not testify that Petitioners needed to go to Kaho' olawe 
because of these altars or any other religiously significant areas. 
Second, even if Petitioners had to travel to Kaho' olawe 
in order to practice their religion, it does not appear that government regulations HAR §§ 13-261-10 and -11, requiring a written application process to go to the island, created a substantial burden on Petitioners’ practice of religion. See 
Adler, 108 Hawai' i at 177, 118 P.3d at 660 (“Appellants must show 
a ‘substantial burden’ on religious interests.”) (citation omitted); see also Sherbert, 274 U.S. at 406 (“We must next consider whether some compelling state interest . . . justifies the substantial infringement of appellants First Amendment right.”). HAR § 13-261-11 provides that written application forms may be obtained from the commission office, and the written application requires fairly standard information, including, 
54
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
inter alia, the number and names of individuals who will
 
participate in the requested entrance, a signed liability waiver,
 description of the purposes and activities associated with the
 entrance, and information pertinent to the exercise of
 traditional and customary rights, if such rights are claimed. 
See HAR 13-261-11(a). Such a process cannot be said to
 “substantially burden” the exercise of religion. While “‘[t]he
 door of the Free Exercise Clause stands tightly closed against
 any governmental regulation of religious beliefs as such []’”,
 Koolau Baptist Church v. Dep’t of Labor & Indus. Relations, 68
 Haw. 410, 718 P.2d 267 (1986) (quoting Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 402
 (emphasis in original)), “‘the freedom to act, even when the
 action is in accord with one’s religious convictions, is not
 totally free from legislative restrictions[,]’” id. (quoting
 Braunfeld v. Brown, 366 U.S. 599, 603 (1961). 
C.
 
Having concluded that Petitioners practice of religion
 
was not substantially burdened by HAR §§ 13-261-10 and -11, the
 remainder of the Sherbert test need not be applied. Therefore,
 there is no need to determine if the regulations are justified
 with a compelling state interest or whether the regulations are
 narrowly tailored to satisfy that interest. Accordingly, under
 these circumstances, the regulations under HAR §§ 13-261-10 and 
-11 do not unconstitutionally burden Petitioners’ right to
 practice their religion.
