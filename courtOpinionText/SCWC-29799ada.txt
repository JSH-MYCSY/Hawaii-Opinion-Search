OPINION OF THE COURT BY NAKAYAMA, J.
 
In this case we hold that mere proximity and power to
 
exercise control over contraband are insufficient to sustain a
 
conviction for possession absent evidence of intent. 
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellee Raymond L. Foster was found guilty
           
     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
by a jury of, inter alia, one count of being a felon in
 
possession of a firearm and one count of being a felon in
 possession of ammunition. Following the jury verdict, the
 
1
Circuit Court of the Second Circuit  granted Foster’s renewed
motion for judgment of acquittal on those two counts, concluding that the evidence adduced at trial did not establish that Foster had the requisite intent to exercise dominion and control over the subject firearm and ammunition. On appeal by Respondent/Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawai' i, the Intermediate 
Court of Appeals (“ICA”) concluded that there was sufficient evidence of intent, vacated the circuit court’s order granting Foster’s renewed motion for judgment of acquittal, and remanded for resentencing based on the jury’s guilty verdicts. We accepted Foster’s application for writ of certiorari to consider his contention that the ICA’s decision was inconsistent with the law of constructive possession in this jurisdiction, and we now conclude that the ICA erred in vacating the circuit court’s order granting Foster’s renewed motion for acquittal of both the firearm and ammunition charges. In light of the countervailing evidence in the record demonstrating that the firearm and ammunition were in the possession of Foster’s passenger Phillip Malano, we hold that Foster’s ownership of the vehicle involved

and his proximity to the items at the time of arrest were,
 
without more, insufficient to establish his intent to exercise
 dominion and control over the items and thus his constructive
 possession of them. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the
 ICA and reinstate the circuit court’s order granting Foster’s
 renewed motion for judgment of acquittal of the firearm and
 ammunition charges.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
A. Factual Background
 
At around 2:05 a.m. on August 27, 2006, Department of 
Land and Natural Resources (“DLNR”) conservation enforcement officers Larry Pacheco and John Yamamoto were patrolling for illegal night hunting on the Pi' ilani Highway, located in the 
County of Maui. At that time, Pacheco and Yamamoto were driving toward the remote Kaupo area and saw a vehicle coming from that direction, as well as “a bright strong light moving back and forth, which might be an indicator of night hunting.” Pacheco and Yamamoto used their DLNR vehicle to block the lane of travel heading back toward town and flagged down the vehicle, “a white two-door Toyota 4Runner[,]” as it approached; it stopped approximately twenty to twenty-five yards in front of them. The officers then approached the vehicle, and Yamamoto “heard a sound like a hunting rifle type slide chamber.” There were four people 
3
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
in the 4Runner: Foster in the driver’s seat, Malano in the front
 
passenger seat, Wendy Gonsalves in the rear on the driver’s side,
 and Malia Saunders in the rear on the passenger’s side. Pacheco
 approached the 4Runner on the passenger’s side and “saw an
 ammunition clip [i]n the center between the driver and passenger
 on the seat.” Pacheco and Yamamoto then ordered all four people
 out of the 4Runner; Pacheco handcuffed Foster and conducted a pat
 down search but did not find any ammunition on Foster’s person.
 
In order for the rear seat passengers to exit the
 
4Runner, Yamamoto slid the front passenger seat forward; at that
 time he observed a rifle “on the floor panel fronting Malia
 Saunders.” Pacheco also testified that the rifle “was on the
 floor panel of the foot area fronting Saunders, and it was not
 under the front passenger’s seat.” During the stop, Pacheco also
 confirmed that Foster was the registered owner of the 4Runner and
 that Malano had an outstanding arrest warrant.
 
Foster agreed to make a statement to Pacheco after
 
being advised of and waiving his constitutional rights. Foster
 said that he picked up Malano earlier in the evening and that
 Malano had a black ukulele case with him. The two men then
 picked up Saunders and Gonsalves and headed toward Kaupo. In the
 Kanaio area, “Malano needed to take a break, and Foster pulled
 over on the side of the road.” Malano then got out of the

vehicle, took a rifle from the ukulele case,  and fired several
rounds. After Malano got back in the 4Runner, they started
 driving back toward town.
 
Foster and Malano were arrested by the Maui Police
 
Department (“MPD”) officers whom Pacheco and Yamamoto had called
 for assistance, and Saunders and Gonsalves were released. 
Saunders and Gonsalves were interviewed by MPD Officer Kenneth
 Doyle the next day and, after being advised of their
 constitutional rights, both gave verbal and signed written
 statements.
 
The Maui grand jury returned an indictment on September
 
3
1, 2006, charging Foster with committing, inter alia,  theoffenses of Ownership or Possession Prohibited of Any Firearm, in violation of Hawai' i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 134-7(b) and/or 
(h), and Ownership or Possession Prohibited of Firearm Ammunition, in violation of HRS § 134-7(b) and/or (h).

2 According to the record, the rifle was a MAK-90 semiautomatic
 
assault rifle. Counsel for the State noted at oral argument that the rifle
would probably fit in a typical ukulele case.
 
3 Foster was also charged with several drug offenses. The circuit 
court granted the State’s motion to dismiss some of those charges, and Fosterwas convicted of the remaining charges. Foster appealed his conviction onthose remaining drug charges based on the circuit court’s denial of his motionto suppress evidence obtained by Pacheco and Yamamoto during the stop, and theICA affirmed.

B. Relevant Trial Proceedings
 
After the State’s case in chief, which consisted of
 
testimony from DLNR Officers Pacheco and Yamamoto, MPD Officer
 
5
Doyle, and MPD Sergeant Barry Aoki,  Foster moved orally for
judgment of acquittal as to the firearm and ammunition charges. 
The court denied the motion but indicated that “certainly there
 are some questions with regard to the charges regarding the
 weapon itself.” 
Both Saunders and Gonsalves chose not to
 
testify, asserting their Fifth Amendment rights against self-
incrimination; the court then allowed defense counsel to read
 portions of their written statements into evidence. According to
 the portions of these statements read into evidence, the four

indictment for, or has been bound over to the circuit court

firearm or ammunition therefor.

guilty of a class C felony; provided that any felon

Prior to trial, the parties stipulated that Foster had a prior felony
conviction as of August 27, 2006.

 Sergeant Aoki only testified that he was responsible for test
 
firing the rifle recovered from the 4Runner. The State also called MPD
 Criminalist Julie Wood and MPD Evidence Custodian Kalaokana Akana to testify;
their testimony was pertinent only to the drug charges.

people in the 4Runner “were smoking ice and marijuana” and Malano
 
was loading bullets into the ammunition clip; at some point they
 stopped, and Malano got out of the 4Runner and shot at a junk
 car
6 on the side of the road; Gonsalves “was loading the gun at
 
one point when [Malano] was loading the clip”; later, upon being
 stopped by the DLNR officers, Malano threw the rifle to the back
 seat and it landed on Saunders’s lap; and Saunders and Gonsalves
 then kicked the gun to the floor. Foster did not testify. The
 defense then introduced into evidence Malano’s judgment,
 conviction, and sentence arising out of the same incident, and
 the court took judicial notice that Malano was found guilty of
 possessing the same items that Foster was charged with possessing
 in this case. The defense then rested.
 
During jury deliberations, the jury communicated the
 
following question to the court: “Is possession determined by
 just being present with the object? Doesn’t there have to be
 connection to that object by way of use or intent to use?” The
 court responded by referring the jury to Jury Instruction Number
 25, which read in full:
 
A person is in possession of an object if the person
knowingly procured or received the thing possessed, or was
aware of his control of it for a sufficient period of time
to have terminated his possession.
The law recognizes two kinds of possession, actual
possession and constructive possession. A person who,
 
Photographs taken during the day following the stop show that
 
Malano had actually shot at an abandoned boat on the side of the road.

although not in actual possession, knowingly has both the
power and the intention at a given time to exercise dominion
or control over a thing for a sufficient period of time to
terminate his possession of it, either directly or through
another person or persons, is then in constructive
possession of it.
The  fact  that  a  person  is  near  an  object  or  is  present
or  associated  with  a  person  who  controls  an  object,  without
more,  is  not  sufficient  to  support  a  finding  of  possession.
The  law  requires  also  that  possession  may  be  sole  or
 
joint.   If  one  person  alone  has  actual  or  constructive
possession  of  a  thing,  possession  is  sole.   If  two  or  more
 
persons  share  actual  or  constructive  possession  of  a  thing,
possession  is  joint.
The  element  of  possession  has  been  proved  if  you  find
beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  that  the  defendant  had  actual  or
constructive  possession,  either  solely  or  jointly  with
others.
 
On January 22, 2009, the jury found Foster guilty as charged of
 
the firearm and ammunition charges. On February 2, 2009, Foster
 renewed his motion for judgment of acquittal as to those charges. 
On February 11, 2009, the circuit court held a hearing and
 granted the motion, concluding that there was insufficient
 evidence to conclude that Foster had the intent to exercise
 dominion or control over either the firearm or the ammunition,
 even though the evidence did show that Foster had 
knowledge of
 
the items and power to exercise dominion or control over them. 
As relevant to the State’s appeal and Foster’s application, the
 court stated:
 
It  appears  that  the  State  did  offer  substantial
evidence  to  show  that  the  defendant  had  the  power  and
ability  to  exercise  control  or  dominion  over  the  firearm.
  
Firearm  was  in  close  proximity  of  the  defendant  and  was
found  in  the  back  seat  of  his  vehicle.   However,  mere
proximity  to  a  prohibited  item  time  [sic]  is  not  sufficient
to  establish  possession.   The  State  must  establish  that  the
 
defendant  had  the  intent  to  possess  the  firearm.
T
he [c]ourt find[s] there was not sufficient evidence
in the record even when drawing all inferences in the
 
8
           
       
        
           
 
            
        
         *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
prosecution’s favor indicating that the defendant had the
necessary intent to exercise control and dominion over the
firearm.
 
The  [s]tatements  of  defendant’s  cohorts  Ms.  Gongsalves
[sic]  and  Saunders  and  other  circumstantial  evidence  adduced
at  trial  do  not  provide  a  basis  for  inferring  defendant’s
state  of  mind  with  regard  to  the  firearm.   Accordingly,  the
[c]ourt’s  going  to  grant  defendant’s  post-trial  motion  for
judgment  of  acquittal  regarding  count  five  having  to  do  with
the  firearm.
 
State  offered  evidence  showing  that  the  ammunition
[w]as  located  in  the  front  passenger  area  of  the  vehicle
between  defendant  and  Malano.   And  I  don’t  think,  quite
frankly,  there  was  much  dispute  about  that.
The  officer,  when  he  shined  his  flashlight  in,  did
indicate  where  that  was  located.   Although  the  ammunition
was  found  closer  to  defendant’s  person  than  the  firearm,
defendant’s  closer  proximity  to  the  ammunition  in  and  of
itself  does  not  compensate  for  the  [in]sufficient  evidence
in  the  record  with  regard  to  defendant’s  intent  to  exercise
dominion  and  control  over  the  ammunition  even  though  there
was  evidence  that  he  had  the  power  and  ability  to  do  so.
In  the  [c]ourt’s  view,  the  most  reasonable  inference
which  a  juror  could  have  made  based  upon  the  combined
statements  of  the  female  passengers  and  the  testimony  of  the
DLNR  officer  who  heard  the  distinct  sound  of  the  slide  of
 
the  rifle  as  they  approached,  was  that  Malano  immediately
prior  to  the  interception  by  the  officer  used  the  slide  to
remove  the  clip,  and  then  put  it  beside  him  when  he  threw
the  weapon  in  the  back  seat.
The  [c]ourt  finds  that  the  State  has  failed  to  come
forward  with  substantial  evidence  such  that  a  reason[able]
mind  might  conclude  that  defendant  had  both  the  power  and
intention  to  exercise  dominion  and  control  over  the
 
ammunition  as  well.   And,  therefore,  the  [c]ourt  is  going  to
grant  defendant’s  motion  for  judgment  of  acquittal  with
regard  to  count  six.
 
The circuit court entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of
 
Law and Order Granting Defendant Raymond Foster’s Renewed Motion
 for Judgment of Acquittal on April 2, 2009, and the State filed
 its Notice of Appeal on May 1, 2009 pursuant to HRS § 641-13(9).

C. The ICA’s October 18, 2011 Summary Disposition Order
 
On appeal to the ICA, the State argued that the circuit
 
court erred as a matter of law in granting the post-trial motion
 
for judgment of acquittal by (1) disregarding the applicable
 standard of review for such motions and by (2) disregarding the
 applicable law on constructive possession.
 
With regard to the first point, the State argued that 
by granting the renewed motion for judgment of acquittal after the jury had found Foster guilty on the firearm and ammunition charges, the circuit court essentially usurped the province of the jury “by disregarding the province of the fact finder to assess the credibility of the witnesses, weigh the evidence, and draw justifiable inferences of fact.” (Citing State v. Timoteo, 87 Hawai' i 108, 112-13, 952 P.2d 865, 869-70 (1997)). 
Significantly, the State noted that when Foster initially moved for judgment of acquittal after the State rested, the circuit court denied that motion after finding that the evidence presented, “considered in the light most favorable to the State and with deference to the right of the jury to assess the 
7...continue
 
the following instances:

guilty[.]

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
credibility of the officers, . . . was sufficient for a prima 
facie case.” Although Foster did not argue against the State on this issue, the ICA nevertheless concluded that the circuit court did not “usurp the province of the jury” in granting the renewed post-verdict motion because Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure 
(HRPP) Rule 29(c) expressly allows the circuit court to grant a motion in that situation.
8 State v. Foster, No. 29799, 125 
Hawai'i 380, 262 P.3d 669, 2011 WL 4953400, at *1 (App. Oct. 18, 
2011) (SDO). This point has not been further argued to this court. 
With regard to the second point, the State argued that 
the circuit court erred by finding that the State had not proven that Foster was in possession of a firearm. Specifically, the State argued that, according to the analysis for possession set out by this court in State v. Jenkins, 93 Hawai' i 87, 111-12, 997 
P.2d 13, 37-38 (2000), the voluntary act of possession can “be 
8 HRPP Rule 29(c) provides:
 
Motion after discharge of duty. If the jury returns a
verdict of guilty or is discharged without having returned a
verdict, a motion for judgment of acquittal may be made or
renewed within 10 days after the jury is discharged or
within such further time as the court may fix during the 10­day period. If a verdict of guilty is returned the court
may on such motion set aside the verdict and enter judgment
of acquittal. If no verdict is returned the court may enter
judgment of acquittal. It shall not be necessary to the
making of such a motion that a similar motion has been made
prior to the submission of the case to the jury.
 
(Emphasis added).
 
11
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
established by the defendant’s awareness of his or her control of
 
that object for a sufficient period to have terminated
 possession.” According to the State, “the facts established that
 Foster was aware of the rifle and the ammunition in his vehicle
 and had power and ability to exercise dominion and control for a
 sufficient period of time, and his failure to terminate
 possession thereof satisfied the Jenkins test for possession.” 
Thus, as the State argued, the circuit court erred by granting
 Foster’s motion of acquittal on the ground that he lacked the
 intent to exercise dominion or control over the rifle and the
 ammunition.
 
In response, Foster argued that the State had not 
presented any evidence to satisfy the element of intent for constructive possession. As a threshold matter, mere proximity to the item is insufficient to establish constructive possession, so the evidence of ammunition found on the front seat and the rifle found in the rear passenger area was insufficient as a matter of law to show intent to possess. (Citing State v. Brown, 97 Hawai' i 323, 326, 37 P.3d 572, 585 (App. 2001); State v. 
Moniz, 92 Hawai' i 472, 476, 992 P.2d 741, 745 (App. 1999)). 
Similarly, Foster argued that the State’s reliance on his ownership of the 4Runner was also inadequate because “the defendant’s ownership or right to possession of the place where 
12
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
the [items] were found, alone, [is] insufficient to support a 
finding of the exercise of dominion and control.” (Quoting Moniz, 92 Hawai' i at 476-77, 992 P.2d at 745-46) (second brackets 
added; internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, although the State had presented evidence showing Foster’s knowledge of the rifle and ammunition inside the 4Runner and the evidence suggested that Foster had the power to exercise dominion and control over the items, there was an absence of evidence showing that Foster had intent to exercise dominion and control. Foster specifically argued that “knowledge alone is insufficient to demonstrate intent.” (Citing Moniz, 92 Hawai' i at 476-77, 992 
P.2d at 745-46). Foster also argued that it was not error for the circuit court to deny his initial motion for acquittal but grant his post-verdict motion for the same. According to Foster, this is because the circuit court focused on the issue of Foster’s knowledge in the initial motion but then properly directed its attention to the issue of intent in the renewed motion and properly concluded that the State failed to adduce any evidence as to intent. Finally, Foster argued that the State misinterpreted the requirements of Jenkins by arguing “that it only needed to show that[] Foster was aware of the rifle and the ammunition in his vehicle for a sufficient period of time to terminate possession.” In Foster’s view, acceptance of the 
13
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
State’s argument “would allow the prosecution to prove 
constructive possession based on mere knowledge of the firearm or ammunition alone.” Instead, Foster maintained that the State must affirmatively prove possession by establishing that the defendant “had both the power and the intent to exercise dominion and control over the firearm or ammunition.” (Citing Jenkins, 93 Hawai'i at 111, 997 P.2d at 37) (emphasis added). Foster 
concluded that because the State “failed to present any evidence that demonstrated Foster’s intent to exercise dominion and control over either the rifle or the ammunition, the trial court properly granted Foster’s motion for judgment of acquittal.” (Citing State v. Aplaca, 96 Hawai' i 17, 21, 25 P.3d 792, 796 
(2001)). 
The ICA held that “there was substantial evidence to
 
support Foster’s convictions” on the firearm and ammunition
 possession charges. Foster, 2011 WL 4953400, at *1. The ICA
 
based this conclusion on several facts and inferences: Foster’s
 proximity to the rifle and the ammunition and his knowledge of
 that proximity; Foster’s “ultimate control over who and what was
 allowed inside the vehicle as well as the activities occurring
 inside the 4Runner[,]” which signified that “Foster could have
 refused to let Malano back into the 4Runner with the rifle and
 ammunition[]”; and Foster’s lack of fear of Malano and the
 
14
           
       
         
         
          
          
          
        
        
       
       
         
        *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
absence of any threats from Malano, which was “circumstantial
 
evidence of, at a minimum, Foster’s willingness to assist Malano
 in the latter’s activities involving use of the firearm and
 ammunition.” Id. at *2. The ICA therefore concluded that
 
“[u]pon viewing the evidence presented in the light most
 favorable to the State, there [wa]s sufficient evidence from
 which the jury could have reasonably concluded that Foster was a
 felon who intentionally possessed the subject rifle and
 ammunition in violation of HRS § 134-7(b).” Id. Accordingly,
 
the ICA vacated the circuit court’s April 2, 2009 order and
 remanded the case for resentencing based on the jury’s guilty
 verdicts. Id. The ICA then filed its judgment on appeal on
 
November 10, 2011.
 
Foster timely filed his application for writ of
 
certiorari on February 8, 2012. The State filed a timely
 response to the application on February 23, 2012.
 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
A. Motion for Judgment of Acquittal
 
When reviewing a post-verdict motion for judgment of
acquittal, we employ the same standard that a trial court
applies to such a motion, namely, whether, upon the evidence
viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution and in
full recognition of the province of the trier of fact, the
evidence is sufficient to support a prima facie case so that
a reasonable mind might fairly conclude guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt. Sufficient evidence to support a prima
facie case requires substantial evidence as to every
material element of the offense charged. Substantial
 evidence as to every material element of the offense charged
is credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and
 
15
           
         
          
         
      
  
        
        
         *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to
support a conclusion. Under such a review, we give full
play to the right of the fact finder to determine
credibility, weigh the evidence, and draw justifiable
inferences of fact.
 
Timoteo, 87 Hawai' i at 112-13, 952 P.2d at 869-70 (quoting State 
v. Jhun, 83 Hawai' i 472, 481, 927 P.2d 1355, 1364 (1996)) 
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
Foster’s application to this court raises a single
 
question: whether the ICA’s decision vacating the circuit court’s
 
order granting his motion for judgment of acquittal is obviously
 inconsistent with decisions of this court, the ICA, and federal
 courts related to constructive possession of contraband because
 it is based primarily on Foster’s proximity to the contraband and
 his status as owner and driver of the 4Runner. Based on the
 analysis that follows, we conclude that the ICA erred in holding
 that the State presented sufficient evidence of Foster’s intent
 to exercise dominion and control over the firearm and ammunition
 to enable the jury to reasonably infer that Foster constructively
 possessed those items.
 
A. The Law of Constructive Possession in the State of Hawai' i 
It is a settled matter of Hawai' i law that possession 
of an item may be either actual or constructive: 
The law, in general, recognizes two kinds of possession:
actual possession and constructive possession. A person who
knowingly has direct physical control over a thing at a
 
16
           
           
        
          
        
         
         
          
          
         
      
            
       *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
given time is then in actual possession of it. A person
who, although not in actual possession, knowingly has both
the power and the intention at a given time to exercise
dominion over a thing, either directly or through another
person or persons, is then in constructive possession of it.
 
Jenkins, 93 Hawai' i at 110, 997 P.2d at 36 (quoting State v. 
Mundell, 8 Haw. App. 610, 617, 822 P.2d 23, 27 (1991) (quoting 
Black’s Law Dictionary 1163 (6th ed. 1990))) (emphases removed; other citations omitted); cf. State v. Opulele, 88 Hawai' i 433, 
439, 967 P.2d 265, 271 (1998) (“The correctness of [the foregoing definition], as a general definition of possession, is not in dispute.”). 
In Jenkins, this court clarified the state of mind
 
required to establish possession of an item and set out a two-
prong analysis for determining the voluntariness of “possession”
 under HRS § 134-7(b):
 
(1) the voluntary act of “possession” of an object itself
is, by way of HRS § 702-202, satisfied where an individual
acts knowingly with respect to his or her conduct; and (2)
the requisite state of mind with respect to the attendant
circumstances-- i.e., the particular qualities of the object
that make it illegal to possess it--is, by way of HRS § 702­204, satisfied by a reckless state of mind.
 
93 Hawai' i at 111, 997 P.2d at 37 (emphases in original). Thus, 
to meet the first part of the test, “the prosecution must first 
adduce evidence that the defendant knowingly procured or received an object, or was aware of his or her control of that object for a sufficient period to have terminated possession.” Id. (citing 
HRS § 702-202). To meet the second part, “the prosecution must, 
17
           
         
        
         
        
      
        
       
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
at the very least, adduce evidence that the defendant possessed
 
the object in reckless disregard of the substantial and
 unjustifiable risk that it was a firearm.” Id. (citing HRS §
 
702-204).
 
Where actual possession of the item is not at issue, 
the State must prove a sufficient nexus between the defendant and the item in order to establish constructive possession of the item: “To support a finding of constructive possession the evidence must show a sufficient nexus between the accused and the [item] to permit an inference that the accused had both the power and the intent to exercise dominion and control over the [item]. Mere proximity is not enough.” Moniz, 92 Hawai' i at 476, 992 
P.2d at 745 (quoting Mundell, 8 Haw. App. at 622, 822 P.2d at 29 (citations omitted)) (brackets added and internal quotation marks omitted); see also Brown, 97 Hawai' i at 336, 37 P.3d at 585 
(same). Moniz further established that 
[p]roof of the defendant’s knowledge of the presence of [the
items] and the defendant’s ownership or right to possession
of the place where the [items] were found, alone, are
insufficient to support a finding of the exercise of
dominion and control. Other incriminating circumstances
must be present to buttress the inference of knowing
possession and provide the necessary link between a
defendant and illegal [items].
 
92 Hawai' i at 476-77, 992 P.2d at 745-46. This court has also 
since noted that it “is correct that mere proximity to the 
[item], mere presence, or mere association with the person who does control the [item] is insufficient to support a finding of 
18
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
possession.” State v. Hironaka, 99 Hawai' i 198, 206, 53 P.3d 
806, 814 (2002) (quoting Mundell, 8 Haw. App. at 620, 822 P.2d at 
29) (brackets added and brackets removed; internal quotation marks omitted). 
B. Foster Had Knowledge of the Firearm and Ammunition and Power
to Exercise Dominion and Control over Them
 
Here, it is undisputed that Foster knew that the rifle 
was inside the 4Runner, at least as of the time that Malano 
removed the rifle from the ukulele case to shoot at the abandoned boat on the side of the road. It is also undisputed that at the time the DLNR officers stopped the 4Runner, Foster had the power to exercise dominion and control over the rifle and the ammunition given the presence of those items inside the 4Runner and Foster’s proximity to them. However, even if knowledge and proximity are conclusively established, intent cannot be thereby presumed. “[A]lthough [Foster] most certainly knew of the existence of the items and their potential for illegal use, knowledge and ability to possess do not equal possession where there is no evidence of intent to make use of that knowledge and ability.” Moniz, 92 Hawai' i at 479, 992 P.2d at 748 (quoting 
Spanish Fork City v. Bryan, 975 P.2d 501, 503 (Utah App. 1999)) (brackets added and brackets removed; emphasis removed). That is, intent to exercise dominion and control over the items must thus be proven in addition to knowledge of the items and power to 
19
           
         
              
            
             
               
          
            
             *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
exercise dominion and control over them.
 
C. The Evidence Does Not Support the Inference That Foster Had
the Intent to Exercise Dominion and Control over the Firearm and
 
Ammunition
 
As noted supra, to establish constructive possession of 
an item, intent to exercise dominion and control over it must be 
shown in addition to knowledge of the item and the power to exercise dominion and control. As the ICA stated in Moniz, “[o]ther incriminating circumstances” beyond knowledge of the item, the defendant’s proximity to the item, or the defendant’s ownership of or right to possess the place where the item is found, “must be present to buttress the inference of knowing possession and provide the necessary link between a defendant and illegal [items].” Moniz, 92 Hawai' i at 477, 992 P.2d at 746. 
The ICA has discussed the principles of constructive possession in some depth in two cases; we conclude that the present case is analogous to Moniz and distinguishable from Brown.
9 
Moniz involved constructive possession of marijuana and
 
a scale containing methamphetamine residue found inside the
 apartment belonging to defendant-appellant Juliet Moniz and her
 
9
 This court has not yet decided a constructive possession case 
based on whether power and intent to possess have been proven by the State.
In Jenkins , we vacated the defendant’s conviction and remanded for a new trial
based in part on our clarification of the state of mind required to establishpossession of an item. Jenkins , 93 Hawai 'i at 115, 997 P.2d at 41. Shortly
thereafter, in Valentine , we vacated in part the defendant’s conviction and
remanded in order that the jury could be given new instructions pursuant toJenkins . State v. Valentine , 93 Hawai 'i 199, 210, 998 P.2d 479, 490 (2000).

           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
husband, defendant Richard Moniz. Id. at 474, 992 P.2d at 743. 
Juliet was found guilty of the charges relating to the marijuana
 
and the scale, but not guilty of a separate charge for the
 methamphetamine residue. Id. at 475, 992 P.2d at 744. On
 
appeal, the ICA reversed Juliet’s conviction, holding that she
 had the power but not the intent to possess the marijuana and the
 scale. Id. at 477, 478, 992 P.2d at 746, 747. Because Juliet
 
and Richard lived together in the apartment, the ICA began by
 noting that it is more difficult to conclude that constructive
 possession exists “in cases such as this one, where a defendant
 does not have exclusive possession or control of the place where
 drugs are found and no drugs are found on the defendant’s actual
 person.” Id. at 476, 992 P.2d at 745. The ICA concluded that
 
the power requirement was met with respect to the marijuana
 because it “was found in a drawer in the bedroom dresser that
 Juliet shared with Richard[,]” because “Juliet washe[d],
 fold[ed], and put[] the clothes away and . . . would see anything
 in the drawer[,]” because “the marijuana had been in the dresser
 drawer for two months” at the time of her arrest, and because she
 “admitted that she had seen the marijuana in the drawer and knew
 what it was[.]” Id. at 477, 992 P.2d at 746. With respect to
 
the scale, although Juliet denied knowledge of its presence,
 Richard testified that Juliet may have come into contact with the
 
21
           
          
 
           
       *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
scale in the process of cleaning the apartment. Id. at 478, 992
 
P.2d at 747. Further, Richard “admitted that he used the scale
 
to weigh the drugs he sold and bought and that Juliet knew that
 he used and sold drugs and that some of the money he was giving
 her each month was from his drug sales.” Id. Thus, the ICA
 
concluded that “a reasonable jury could conclude that Juliet . .
 . was aware of the existence of the scale and its use by Richard
 for illegal purposes.” Id. As to the intent requirement,
 
however, the ICA determined that there was “insufficient
 evidence.” Id. at 477, 992 P.2d at 746. As for the marijuana,
 
“Richard and Juliet both testified that Juliet strongly opposed
 Richard’s use of drugs, did not procure the marijuana, and never
 smoked marijuana.” Id. Additionally, Juliet testified that she
 
could not even have disposed of the marijuana because it was
 Richard’s, and “if [he] cannot find it, he going get mad.” Id. 
As for the scale, it was found in a bucket along with Richard’s
 driver’s license but none of Juliet’s belongings; also, “there
 [wa]s no evidence in the record that Juliet intended to use the
 scale for any of the following prohibited purposes listed in HRS
 § 329-43.5(a)[.]”
10 Id. at 478, 992 P.2d at 747. As a result,
 
10
 HRS § 329-43.5(a) (1993) provided then, as it does now, in
 
pertinent part:
 
It is unlawful for any person to use, or to possess with
intent to use , drug paraphernalia to plant, propagate,

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
the lack of evidence to support Juliet’s intent to exercise
 
dominion and control over the marijuana and the scale
 necessitated reversal of her conviction on those counts. Id. at
 
480, 992 P.2d at 749.
 
In Brown, the defendant was convicted of, inter alia, 
possession of burglar’s tools and unauthorized control of a propelled vehicle. 97 Hawai' i at 325, 37 P.3d at 574. On 
appeal, Brown argued that “the State failed to adduce substantial evidence that he ‘constructively possessed the burglar’s tools’ that were found in a backpack on the floorboard near the front passenger’s seat of the van.” Id. at 326, 37 P.3d at 575. The 
ICA disagreed with Brown and affirmed his conviction and sentence based on its conclusion that there was substantial circumstantial evidence to establish Brown’s intent to possess the burglar’s tools. Id. at 340, 37 P.3d at 589. According to the ICA’s 
opinion, the facts showed that at the time of Brown’s arrest, the van in question had been reported stolen, it was not moving because it had “crashed into [a] wall,” “only the driver’s and front passenger’s doors were open,” and “Brown was found on the

ground in front of the van on the driver’s side,” leading to the 
inference that Brown had been driving the stolen van until it crashed into the wall. Id. at 334, 37 P.3d at 583. Further, the 
evidence showed that “[t]he backpack was on the floorboard near the front passenger’s seat, open and within Brown’s reach, with a pair of bolt cutters visibly sticking out of the backpack.” Id. 
at 337, 37 P.3d at 586 (citation omitted). Because the van “had just recently been stolen from NF, which testimony indicated was a seafood distributor, the jury could reasonably infer that the backpack containing the tools had not been placed in the van by any employee of NF, but by Brown or the other passenger in the stolen van.” Id. Although it was likely according to the 
evidence that the backpack was located closer to the front passenger, the ICA noted that “Hawai' i recognizes that two or 
more persons can be in joint possession of an item[,]” id. (citing Mundell, 8 Haw. App. at 617, 822 P.2d at 27), and that “[w]here two co-conspirators are engaged in a joint criminal activity, possession by one of the tools to further the criminal activity will be imputed to the other.” Id. (citing Solomon v. 
State, 350 S.E.2d 35, 36 (Ga. App. 1986); Franklin v. Commonwealth, 477 S.W.2d 788, 791 (Ky. 1972)). 
In this case, as in Moniz, there is no dispute that
 
Foster knew that the firearm and the ammunition were inside the
 
24
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
4Runner, and it could be inferred by rational jurors that Foster
 
had the power to exercise dominion and control over those items
 based on his proximity to them inside the vehicle. However,
 Foster’s knowledge of and power over the items did not provide a
 sufficient nexus between him and the items to prove possession in
 the absence of intent to exercise dominion and control over the
 items; intent is a separate requirement that must be proven in
 addition to knowledge and power. Here, as in Moniz, the State
 failed to present any evidence that Foster had the intent to
 exercise dominion and control over the firearm and the
 ammunition. As that lack of evidence could not have permitted a
 reasonable juror to make the inference that Foster was in
 constructive possession of the firearm and ammunition, the ICA
 thus erred in vacating the circuit court’s order by concluding
 that “there was substantial evidence to support Foster’s
 convictions[.]” Foster, 2011 WL 4953400, at *1.
 
“To support a finding of constructive possession the 
evidence must show a sufficient nexus between the accused and the [object] to permit an inference that the accused had both the power and the intent to exercise dominion or control over the [object]. Mere proximity is not enough.” Id. (quoting Brown, 97 
Hawai'i at 336, 37 P.3d at 585) (brackets and emphases in 
original; internal quotation marks omitted). As the ICA stated, 
25
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
“[t]he undisputed facts in the record reveal that Foster had
 
knowledge that the rifle and ammunition were in proximity to him
 in the vehicle . . . .” Id. at *2. However, according to the
 
evidence adduced at trial, the rifle belonged not to Foster but
 to Malano; Malano entered the 4Runner with the rifle, and at that
 time it was inside a black ukulele case and hidden from view;
 Malano retained control over the rifle from the time he entered
 the 4Runner until the DLNR officers stopped the 4Runner; at no
 time did Foster show any interest in, handle, or attempt to
 handle the rifle; only Malano and Gonsalves handled bullets in
 order to load them into the ammunition clip and into the rifle;
 and the rifle was discovered on the floor of the vehicle between
 the front passenger seat and rear passenger seat only because
 Malano had thrown the rifle back to Saunders, who then kicked it
 to the floor. None of this evidence suggested that Foster
 exercised, or intended to exercise, any control over the rifle or
 that Foster was directing Malano’s use of the rifle.
 
Furthermore, the record does not demonstrate that the
 
rifle was used in furtherance of criminal activity as
 contemplated by Brown. We also note that there was insufficient
 evidence in the record to suggest a joint venture and/or an
 agreement between Foster and Malano to go deer hunting or
 shooting for pleasure in that remote area of Maui. Cf. Brown, 97

      *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
Hawai'i at 337-38, 37 P.3d at 586-87 (imputing criminal liability 
for constructive possession where there was substantial evidence 
that the defendant and his passenger were engaged in joint criminal activity). Although Foster’s 4Runner was stopped by Pacheco and Yamamoto because it was the first vehicle to approach after they noticed the light panning and blocked the town-bound lane of the highway, the officers did not subsequently discover any light source on or in the car consistent with the panning they had just observed. Officer Yamamoto also testified that the subject rifle in this case is not of a type commonly used for hunting, and MPD Sergeant Aoki testified that it “can be” but is “[n]ot typically[ used for hunting activity.]” Moreover, while the trial testimony does not specifically address whether other hunting equipment was present in the 4Runner, the State conceded at oral argument that there was no evidence of the 4Runner containing any equipment or materials for hunting. 
The ICA also stated that Foster’s intent to have
 
dominion and control over the rifle and ammunition could be
 inferred by the fact that
 
Foster willingly and intentionally allowed Malano to re­
enter the 4Runner with the rifle and ammunition after Foster
 knew that Malano was carrying a working rifle and
ammunition. As the driver and owner of the 4Runner, Foster
had ultimate control over who and what was allowed inside
 the vehicle as well as the activities occurring inside the
4Runner. Foster could have refused to let Malano back into
 the 4Runner with the rifle and ammunition.
 
Foster, 2011 WL 4953400, at *2. However, control, possession, or
 
27
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
even ownership of a place is not itself sufficient “to support a 
finding of the exercise of dominion and control.” Moniz, 92 
Hawai'i at 477, 992 P.2d at 746. As the United States Court of 
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit aptly stated in a case cited by Foster in his application, “when two or more people are occupying a place, a defendant’s control over the place is not by itself enough to establish constructive possession of contraband found there.” United States v. Crain, 33 F.3d 480, 486 (5th Cir. 
1994). The same court earlier stated, in another case cited by Foster: “Thus, while dominion over the vehicle certainly will help the government’s case, it alone cannot establish constructive possession of a weapon found in the vehicle, particularly in the face of evidence that strongly suggests that somebody else exercised dominion and control over the weapon.” United States v. Wright, 24 F.3d 732, 735 (5th Cir. 1994). Although these federal cases are not binding on this court, they are applicable to and instructive in the present case. Here, despite Foster’s status as driver and owner of the vehicle in which the firearm and ammunition were found, no evidence beyond that status demonstrates that Foster had any intent to exercise dominion and control over the items; in fact, the evidence in the record only links the items to Malano (and Gonsalves, who at some point loaded a number of bullets into the rifle) from the time 
28
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
Malano entered the 4Runner until the time that the DLNR officers
 
stopped the 4Runner later that night. Although “dominion over a
 vehicle in which a firearm is found can lead to an inference of
 constructive possession[,]” that inference fails in the face of
 “overwhelming countervailing evidence” linking the firearm to
 another passenger. Id. That was the case in Wright, and that is
 
the case here.
 
Mindful that our standard of review of a motion for
 
judgment of acquittal is the same as the trial court’s, namely
 whether there is substantial evidence as to every material
 element of the offense as charged, we thus hold that the ICA
 erred in concluding that there was sufficient evidence of intent
 for a jury to infer that Foster thus constructively possessed the
 subject rifle and ammunition in violation of HRS § 134-7(b). As
 the Crain court stated: “We are especially reluctant to infer
 constructive possession of contraband by one occupant [of a
 vehicle] when there is evidence in the record explicitly linking
 the contraband to another occupant.” 33 F.3d at 486 (citing
 United States v. Mergerson, 4 F.3d 337, 349 (5th Cir. 1993)). 
Here, the State’s evidence only went so far as to show Foster’s
 ownership of and presence in the 4Runner and his proximity to the
 firearm and ammunition. Accordingly, absent evidence of intent,
 the circuit court correctly granted Foster’s renewed motion for
 judgment of acquittal, and the ICA erred in vacating the circuit
 
29
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
court’s judgment.
 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
Based upon the foregoing, we vacate the ICA’s 
November 10, 2011 judgment and reinstate the circuit court’s
 
April 2, 2009 order granting Foster’s renewed motion for judgment
 of acquittal.
