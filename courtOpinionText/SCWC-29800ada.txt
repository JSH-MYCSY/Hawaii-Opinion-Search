CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS

RECKTENWALD, C.J., NAKAYAMA, ACOBA, DUFFY, AND MCKENNA, JJ.
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY ACOBA, J.
 
We hold that in a personal injury case (1) when a jury
 
awards special damages but returns a zero general damages award
 
for pain and suffering, it is not an abuse of discretion for the
 court to instruct the jury that the verdict is inconsistent, and
 to direct the jury to continue deliberations on the amount of
 general damages to be awarded; (2) when, after resubmittal to the
 jury in such a case, the jury returns a general damages award
 that is the symbolic equivalent of no award, the verdict is
         
          
        
     ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
inconsistent; thus, (3) in the instant case, the jury’s $1.00
 
general damages award, after resubmittal of the general damages
 question, was the symbolic equivalent of no award at all, in
 light of its $12,280.41 special damages award; and (4) under the
 circumstances of this case, a new trial on damages must be
 granted. The application for writ of certiorari (Application) in
 this case was filed on July 5, 2011 by Petitioners/Plaintiffs­Appellees/Cross-Appellants Gregory Kanahele, Sr. (Kanahele),
 individually and as next friend of Gregory Kanahele, a minor
 (Gregory), and Trishalynn Kanahele, a minor (Trishalynn)
 (collectively, Petitioners). Petitioners sought review of the
 April 27, 2011 judgment of the Intermediate Court of Appeals
 (ICA) filed pursuant to its April 7, 2011 summary disposition

The following essential matters, some verbatim, are

At approximately 7:20 a.m. on December 16, 2003,
 
Gregory was struck by a vehicle driven by Respondent/Defendant­Appellant/Cross-Appellee James Han (Respondent) while Gregory was

intersection of Likini and Ala Nalana Streets in Honolulu.
 
Kanahele and Gregory’s sister Trishalynn witnessed the collision. 
On April 5, 2006, Petitioners filed a Complaint against
 
Respondent alleging, inter alia, that the accident was caused by
 Respondent’s negligent conduct, that Gregory sustained “severe
 physical injuries, pain, suffering, serious emotional distress,
 and loss of enjoyment of life[,]” and that Kanahele and
 Trishalynn suffered injury. 
Jury trial commenced on February 25, 2008. The 
February 21, 2001 videotaped deposition testimony of Dr. Timothy McLaughlin (Dr. McLaughlin), the doctor who “consulted, evaluated, and managed” Gregory’s injury and saw Gregory after the incident, was played to the jury. Dr. McLaughlin explained that Gregory had been in an accident in which the handlebar of Gregory’s racer scooter went through his cheek. Gregory was “distraught” and “very upset” when Dr. McLaughlin first saw him at Kapi'olani Hospital. According to Dr. McLaughlin, when 
Gregory arrived at the hospital, he was in “mild to moderate distress” and in “pain”. Gregory had difficulty opening his mouth. 
Gregory had a “complex laceration” of his cheek and a
 
two-inch laceration on his jaw bone. One two-inch laceration
 
3
went through the mandible  and up the cheek, and another
approximately three-inch laceration was inside the mouth. There
 
3
 The  mandible  is  defined  as  the  “lower  jaw  consisting  of  a  single
 
bone  or  of  completely  fused  bones.”   Merriam  Webster’s  Collegiate  Dictionary

was also ripping of the “buccal mucosa”  and gums, that caused a
“gaping wound” inside the mouth. Dr. McLaughlin stated that he
 performed a “complex closure with an advancement flap[.]” 
In this procedure, he cleaned the wound, used scissors
 
or a scalpel blade to remove the tissue that could not be saved,
 sutured it to put the remaining skin together, and then covered
 the skin with an advancement flap, or tissue that was rotated
 from the top cheek. The operation took two hours, and he used
 dozens of sutures. Risks of the surgery were poor cosmetic
 outcome, scarring, salivation problems, difficulty swallowing,
 and chronic tooth pain. If Gregory did not have surgery, he
 would be quite disfigured. According to Dr. McLaughlin, Gregory
 did not suffer pain at the time of the procedure because he was
 under local anaesthesia, and it was unclear whether he had a
 permanent scar.
 
The medical invoices indicated that on December 16,
 
2003, Gregory received treatment for his injuries that were
 described as an “open wound[,]” “wound(s), complex,” and a “head
 injury[.]” He was “[t]ransport[ed]” by “[a]mbulance” to
 Kapiolani Medical Center. He received a “tetanus” immunization,
 was given “lidocaine[,]” which is a “crystalline compound [] that
 . . . is used . . . in the form of its hydrochloride as a local
 anesthetic[,]” Merriam Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary 671 
(10th ed. 1993), and “acetaminophen,” which is a “crystalline

 Dr. McLaughlin explained that the buccal mucosa refers to the
 
lining of the inside of the mouth. See DeLeon v. State , 684 S.W.2d 774, 776
(Tex. Ct. App. 1984) (stating that the buccal mucosa “is the internal surface
 
of the mouth under the lips and gums”).

compound [] that . . . is used . . . in medicine to relieve pain
 
and fever[.]” Id. at 9. Gregory received treatment from
 
December 16, 2003 to September 3, 2004. 
The cost of Dr. McLaughlin’s treatment was $7,924.49. 
Additionally, invoices for medical care and treatment indicated
 
5
that Gregory incurred $12,280.41 in total  for bills relating to
the accident. The medical costs included services for X-rays,
 
6
and “CT[s]”  of the “[m]axillofacial [a]rea[,]” “[h]ead” and
“coronal, sagittal, MU[.]”7
 
Moreover, Respondent testified that, when driving at a
 
speed of fifteen to twenty miles per hour, the side-view mirror
 of his automobile hit Gregory, who was pushing a motor scooter. 
After the accident, a hairline crack extended across Respondent’s
 windshield. Respondent exited his car and went to Gregory, who
 was moaning and “bleeding from his mouth.” Respondent carried
 him to the sidewalk. Respondent saw blood “around” Gregory’s
 chin and mouth. 
On March 3, 2008, the court read the instructions to
 
the jury, explaining, inter alia, that “[g]eneral damages are
 those damages which fairly and adequately compensate plaintiff(s)

 CT probably refers to a “CAT” scan. “CAT scan refers to a 
computerized axial tomography scan which makes a record of the internalstructures of the body by passing x-rays through the body to act on speciallysensitized film.” Walsh v. Chan , 80 Hawai 'i 188, 194 n.6, 907 P.2d 774, 780

respects,” 80 Hawai 'i 212, 908 P.2d 1198 (1995) (internal quotation marks and

         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
for any past, present, and reasonably probable future disability,
 
pain, and emotional distress caused by the injuries sustained[,]” 
whereas special damages are those that “can be calculated
 precisely or can be determined . . . with reasonable certainty
 from the evidence.” Additionally, the court stated that pain is
 “subjective, and medical science may or may not be able to
 determine whether pain actually exists[,]” but the jury was to
 “decide, considering all the evidence, whether pain did, does and
 will exist.” Furthermore, the court instructed that if the jury
 found that Respondent was liable, Petitioners were “entitled” to
 damages that would “fairly and adequately compensate them for the
 injuries they suffered.” To that end, the jury was to consider
 the following:
 
1. The extent and nature of the injuries [Petitioners]
received , and also the extent to which, if at all, the
injuries they received are permanent;
2. The deformity, scars and/or disfigurement [Gregory]
received, and also the extent to which, if at all, the
deformity, scars and/or disfigurement are permanent;
3. The reasonable value of the medical services provided by
physicians, hospitals and other health care providers ,
including examinations, attention and care, drugs, supplies,
and ambulance services, reasonably required and actually
given in the treatment of [Gregory];
4. The pain, emotional suffering, and disability
which they have received and are reasonably probable
to suffer in the future because of the injuries, if
any.
 
(Emphases added.) The court also provided the jury with a
 
special verdict form. 
That day, March 3, 2008, the jury reached a verdict. 
The jury’s special verdict determined that (1) Gregory was
 injured, but Kanehele and Trishalynn were not; (2) Respondent was
 negligent; (3) Respondent’s negligence was a legal cause of the
 collision with Gregory; (4) Gregory was negligent; (5) the

            ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
negligence of Gregory was a legal cause of the injury and damage
 
sustained by him; (6) Kanahele was negligent; (7) the negligence
 of Kanahele was a legal cause of the injury and damage sustained
 by Gregory; (8) Respondent was 45% at fault for the injury,
 damage, or loss sustained by Gregory; (9) Gregory was 45% at
 fault for the injury, damage, or loss that he sustained;
 (10) Kanahele was 10% at fault for the injury, damage, or loss
 that was sustained by Gregory; and (8) Gregory suffered
 $12,280.41 in special damages but $0 in general damages.

Upon approaching the bench, the parties agreed that the
 
verdict was defective. Respondent’s counsel stated that there
 was a “flaw” in the verdict inasmuch as when the jury finds
 special damages, it “must find at least one cent in general
 damages[,]” because case law indicates “if you have special
 damages there needs to be general damages.” Petitioners’ counsel
 agreed. Respondent’s counsel proposed to give an instruction
 that the jurors must find “at least one cent” in general damages,
 to which Petitioners’ counsel responded that such an instruction
 would be “prejudicial” because “it’s inviting them to come back
 with one cent.” The court asked for supplemental briefing by the
 parties, and directed the jury to return on March 5, 2008,
 because it was possible that the jury would have to continue
 deliberations. 
On March 4, 2008, Respondent filed a supplemental

 “General damages encompass all the damages which naturally and 
necessarily result from a legal wrong done, . . . and include such items as
pain and suffering, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment which cannot bemeasured definitively in monetary terms.” Bynum v. Magno , 106 Hawai 'i 81, 85,
101 P.3d 1149, 1153 (2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).

memorandum arguing that the defective verdict could be
 
“rectified” inasmuch as (1) the defect was discovered prior to
 the acceptance of the verdict, entry of judgment, and release of
 the jurors, and (2) the court had the power to resubmit a
 potentially inconsistent verdict to the jury. Respondent
 proffered three options for the court: (1) send the jury into
 deliberation for consideration of the question regarding general
 damages without further instruction, (2) send the jury back into
 deliberation for consideration of the question regarding general
 damages with a further instruction explaining that some general
 damages must be awarded if special damages are awarded, and if
 the jurors cannot agree on an amount, nominal damages would
 suffice, (3) send the jury back into deliberation with a
 different instruction, explaining that if special damages are
 awarded, then some amount of general damages must also be
 awarded, at least in the nominal amount of $1.00. Respondent
 requested the second alternative. 
On March 5, 2008, Petitioners filed a motion for a
 
“Mistrial and/or New Trial Based on Rule 7[ 
9 ] and 59[ 10
 ],” arguing
that the award of special damages with no general damages was
 improper and the court could not remedy the defect by instructing
 the jury regarding general and special damages because “[t]he
 jury has spoken and the court cannot direct them [sic] to change

 Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 7(b) (2008) provides 
in pertinent part that an application for an order “shall be by motion which,
unless . . . during a hearing or trial, shall be made in writing[.]” 
10
 HRCP Rule 59(a) (2008) provides in pertinent part that a new trial
 
may be granted “in an action in which there has been a trial by jury, for any
of the reasons for which new trials have heretofore been granted in actions at
law in the courts of the State[.]”

their [sic] mind.” According to Petitioners, “it would be 
improper for the [c]ourt to direct the jury to change its mind on the issue of general damages and come back with some other amount. Obviously some other amount would be a nominal amount.” (Citing Bynum, 106 Hawai' i at 85, 101 P.3d at 1153.) Petitioners 
argued that the court must grant a new trial and empanel a new jury. 
On March 5, 2008, before the return of the jury, the
 
court and the parties held a hearing. The court explained that
 the parties and the court had met in chambers on March 4, at
 which time the court informed the parties of its intended action.

 provided that an
 According to the court, “applicable case law”  award of special damages without general damages is inconsistent,
 rendering the jury verdict in the instant case defective. 
Because acceptance of the verdict would require a new trial, the
 court proposed to “give the jury a supplemental jury instruction
 regarding this issue,” and to tell them to deliberate on the 
11 The court cited Walsh, 80 Hawai 'i at 194, 907 P.2d at 780, and 
Dunbar v. Thompson, 79 Hawai 'i 306, 315, 901 P.2d 1285, 1294 (App. 1995). 
Walsh noted that a 
“zero” general damages award is either: (1) inconsistent
with the special damages award; (2) in disregard of the
proper instructions of the trial court; (3) against the
great weight of the evidence; or (4) the result of an
improper compromise by jurors unconvinced of liability but
willing to compromise their positions in return for a
limitation of damages to actual out-of-pocket losses.

general damages issue alone, “with the supplemental verdict
 
form[.]” 
Petitioners objected to the new instruction and the
 
supplemental special verdict form, arguing that “the jury has
 already rendered an inconsistent verdict,” and “to call [it]
 back, in essence re-impanel [it], and request that [it] change
 [its] verdict, is contrary to law.” The court responded that it
 did not accept the verdict, the court was not re-impaneling the
 jury inasmuch as the court told the jury that it “was released
 for the day,” and “might be going back into deliberations[,]” and
 only when a court “erroneously accept[s]” an inconsistent verdict
 is a new trial the only remedy. 
Over Petitioners’ objection, the court provided the
 
jury, at 8:36 a.m. on March 5, 2008, with the following
 additional instruction:
 
(Emphasis added.) The jury was given a supplemental special
 
verdict form asking, “What are the total special and general
 damages of [Gregory]?” The form indicated that special damages 
12
 Question 11 stated, “Without regard to your answers to question
 
number 10 [regarding the percentage of negligence attributable to the
parties], what are the total special and general damages of [Gregory], if any?
(If you answered question number 1 ‘no’ [involving whether Gregory was
injured], then your answer to this question must be 0.)”

was awarded for $12,280.41, and left a blank to be filled in by
 
the jury for the amount of general damages. 
The jury returned to its deliberations, and at 9:03
 
a.m., the jury provided the following communication:
 
The jury has read the instructions and request the following
clarification. With respect to general damages for
[Gregory], what is the range the law allows? What is the
 
minimum under the law ?
 
(Emphasis added.) By agreement of counsel, the court responded,
 
“As you have been instructed, the amount of general damages is
 for you to decide.” 
The jury returned to its deliberations, and at 9:35
 
a.m., returned with a general damages award of one dollar. 
Eleven out of the twelve jurors agreed with that amount.
13 The
 
court orally entered judgment “in accordance with the verdict and
 the law.” After discharge of the jury, Petitioners renewed their
 objection to allowing the jury to re-deliberate on the general
 damages issue, which the court denied. 
On April 3, 2008, Petitioners filed a motion for a new
 
trial, arguing that a new trial must be granted because (1) both
 special and general damages are largely dependent on the same
 proof, (2) by awarding special damages for medical expenses, the
 jury must have determined that Gregory sustained some pain and
 suffering, (3) the jury’s failure to award general damages was
 inconsistent with its award of special damages, (4) the court’s
 additional instruction, in effect, told the jury to return with a

nominal amount, which is not a proper award for general damages,
 
and (5) the nominal $1.00 general damages award did not remedy
 the defective verdict. The motion was denied on June 27, 2008. 
After reduction for the negligence of Gregory, judgment “in favor
 of [Gregory] and against [Respondent] and [Kanahele] for the
 total amount of $6,754.77[]” was entered on June 30, 2008.

II.
 
On May 1, 2009, Respondent filed a notice of appeal,15
 
and on May 15, 2009 Petitioners filed a notice of cross appeal. 
Petitioners contended that, inter alia, the court 
abused its discretion when it denied Petitioners’ (1) March 5, 2008 motion for a mistrial and/or a new trial in which Petitioners argued that the court should not have issued a supplemental instruction directing it to change its verdict to comply with Hawai' i law and award an amount of general damages; 
(2) April 3, 2008 motion for a new trial, in which Petitioners
 argued that the verdict was inconsistent because there was
 sufficient evidence to award damages for pain and suffering; and
 (3) April 3 motion for a new trial, in which Petitioners argued
 that the jury’s finding that Gregory was 45% at fault and
 
14 However, final judgment was not entered until April 24, 2009. On
 
July 25, 2008, Petitioners filed a notice of appeal from the judgment, but on
November 18, 2008, the ICA dismissed it for lack of jurisdiction on the ground
that the court’s judgment did not satisfy the requirements of an appealable
final judgment. The final judgment entered on April 24, 2009, in addition to
the language in the previous judgment, stated that judgment was entered “in
 favor of [Respondent] and against [Trishalynn] . . . and against [Kanahele].
There are no claims or parties remaining in this case. All other remaining
 claims are dismissed.”
 
15
 The ICA rejected Respondent’s argument in his appeal. Inasmuch as
 
Respondent did not submit an application for certiorari challenging the ICA’s
rejection, Respondent’s assertions before the ICA, and the ICA’s decision with
respect to those assertions, are not discussed further.

           ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Kanahele was 10% at fault went against the great weight of the
 
evidence. Petitioners demanded a new trial. 
On April 7, 2011, the ICA issued its SDO affirming the
 
final judgment of the court and rejecting the contentions
 asserted by both Respondent and Petitioners. 
As a preliminary matter, the ICA noted that 
Petitioners’ opening brief did not comply with Hawai' i Rules of 
16
 Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4)  “because [it] fail[ed]
to cite where in the record the alleged errors occurred and were
 objected to[,]” and warned counsel that “future violations of
 HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) may result in sanctions against them.” 
Kanahele
, 2011 WL 1335732, at *1 n.2.
 
As to Petitioners’ first contention that the court
 
should have ordered a new trial rather than give the supplemental
 instruction, the ICA reasoned that “it was within the . . .
 court’s authority to provide a supplemental jury instruction and
 verdict form to correct the inconsistency in the verdict[,]” id.
 at *3, because (1) the “court saw that the general damages award
 was inconsistent with the special damages award[, and] ‘[w]hen an
 ambiguous or improper verdict is returned by the jury, the court
 should permit the jury to correct the mistake before it is
 discharged[,]’” id. at *2 (quoting Dias v. Vanek, 67 Haw. 114,
 117, 679 P.2d 133, 135 (1984)); (2) Duk v. MGM Grand Hotel, Inc.,

 HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) provides in pertinent part that an opening
 
brief shall contain “[a] concise statement of the points of error set forth in
separately numbered paragraphs. Each point shall state: . . . (ii) where in
the record the alleged error occurred; and (iii) where in the record the
alleged error was objected to . . . .” (Emphasis added.)

320 F.3d 1052, 1058 (9th Cir. 2003)17 was relevant insofar as it
 
indicated that allowing the jury to correct its mistakes
 
conserves judicial resources, and the time and convenience of the
 citizen jurors and the parties, id. at *3; (3) the “jurors
 [would] deliberate in accordance with the intent of the
 instructions of the court to revisit an issue,” inasmuch as it is
 presumed that jurors will properly perform their duties and not
 subvert the law, id. (citations omitted). 
As to Petitioners’ second contention that the $1.00
 
general damages award was inconsistent with the evidence, the ICA
 explained that since Petitioners “failed to provide transcripts
 of [Kanahele’s], [Geregory’s], and [Trishalynn’s] testimonies in
 which these witnesses might have testified as to Gregory[’s]
 . . . injuries and his accompanying pain and suffering[,]” the
 ICA “[wa]s not in a position to determine if the award of $1.00
 is inconsistent with the evidence.” Id. at *3. Although a
 
deposition of Dr. McLaughlin, who repaired Gregory’s facial
 wounds, Respondent’s testimony, and the medical invoices were in
 the record, the ICA concluded that without those transcripts, it
 had an “insufficient basis on which to conclude that the jury's
 award was inconsistent with the evidence.” Id. (citing Lepere v. 
17
 Duk, 320 F.3d at 1058, held as follows:
 
[W]hen the jury is still available, resubmitting an
inconsistent verdict best comports with the fair and
efficient administration of justice. Allowing the jury to
correct its own mistakes conserves judicial resources and
the time and convenience of citizen jurors, as well as those
of the parties. It also allows for a resolution of the case
 according to the intent of the original fact-finder, while
that body is still present and able to resolve the matter.

United Pub. Workers, Local 646, AFL–CIO, 77 Hawai' i 471, 474, 887 
P.2d 1029, 1032 (1995)). 
Petitioners’ third contention, that the jury went
 
against the weight of the evidence in finding Kanahele 10%
 
liable, and Gregory 45% liable, is not raised in its Application. 
On April 18, 2011, Petitioners filed a Motion for
 
Reconsideration on the issue of the one dollar general damages
 award. On April 26, 2011, the ICA denied the motion for
 reconsideration.
 
III.
 
Petitioners list the following question in the
 
Application:
 
Whether the . . . court and ICA erred by failing to grant a
new trial when the jury returned a verdict for zero general
damages then amended their verdict and awarded a nominal
amount of one dollar general damages after being instructed
by the court that they must award general damages.
 
Respondent filed a Response to the Application
 
(Response) on July 20, 2011, arguing that Petitioners’
 
Application should not be accepted because (1) its “Statement of
 the Facts” section contains four paragraphs describing the
 accident that are unsupported by record references, in violation
 of HRAP Rule 28, despite the ICA’s warning that failure to comply
 with HRAP in the future may result in sanctions; (2) Petitioners
 have failed to carry their burden of proving that the jury failed
 to meaningfully consider whether Gregory should have been awarded
 a greater amount in general damages inasmuch as they do not
 provide “all evidence” relevant to the issue or all the facts
 that the jury considered; and (3) Petitioners misrepresented the
 
15
         
 
          
            
          
        
    
          
         
          
            ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
ICA’s opinion to this court when stating that the ICA found the
 
“zero damages award was inconsistent with the evidence,
 therefore, it too should have further found that the nominal
 award of one dollar in general damages was inconsistent with the
 evidence.” [Response at 5] (quoting Application).] (Internal
 quotation marks omitted.) Respondent “asks that [this c]ourt
 
make a finding under Rule 38 [ 18
 ] of the [HRAP] so that appropriate
action may be taken[.]”19
 
IV.
 
Respondent’s first and third arguments, which are
 
procedural in nature, are addressed before reaching the dispute
 in the Application and Response regarding the merits. 
Respondent’s first argument that Petitioners’ Application be
 rejected is not persuasive because (1) the four paragraphs
 lacking record references are uncontested, (2) authority for
 rejecting an application for noncompliance with HRAP Rule
 28(b)(3) is not provided, and (3) this court’s policies support a
 review of the merits of an application. 
The Application’s “Statement of the Facts” section
 
consists of approximately three pages. While the four
 paragraphs, totaling a page in length, lack record references,
 the rest of the section contains citations to the record on
 
18
 HRAP Rule 38 provides that “[i]f a Hawai 'i appellate court 
determines that an appeal decided by it was frivolous, it may, after a
separately filed motion or notice from the appellate court and reasonableopportunity to respond, award damages, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, to the appellee.” 
19
 Respondent asks for this finding, due to Petitioners’ filing of a
 
writ with “insufficient factual support[.]” However, inasmuch as the
Application is accepted, the Application is not “frivolous[,]” HRAP Rule 38,
 and, thus, Respondent’s request for such a finding is denied.
 
16
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
appeal and to the transcripts of the proceedings. The four
 
subject paragraphs relate to the facts of the collision, wherein
 Petitioners state that (1) Gregory and Trishalynn were on their
 way to school, (2) Gregory was pushing his motor scooter in a
 crosswalk, (3) Gregory was hit by Respondent, who did not see
 Gregory or Trishalynn before the collision, (4) the scooter
 “flipped up and broke the windshield” of Respondent’s car and the
 handlebar “punctured the left side of Gregory’s [cheek,]” (5) the
 impact threw Gregory “approximately 17 feet to the east[,]”
 (6) Gregory was transported in serious condition to the emergency
 room “where he was observed for a concussion and had oral surgery
 to repair the wounds to his face and mouth[,]” and (7) as a
 result, Gregory sustained physical injuries and incurred general
 and special damages. None of these matters are at issue since
 liability and treatment are not disputed. 
Respondent does not cite a case dismissing an
 
application or denying an appeal because of non-compliance with
 HRAP Rule 28(b)(3). HRAP Rule 30 provides in pertinent part that
 “[w]hen the brief of an appellant is otherwise not in conformity
 with these rules, the appeal may be dismissed or the brief
 stricken and monetary or other sanctions may be levied by the
 appellate court[,]” (emphasis added), giving an appellate court
 “discretion” to determine the proper course of action, In re
 McKeague, No. 27567, 2006 WL 1892821, at *1 (July 11, 2006)
 (SDO). 
This “discretion” has been exercised often in favor of
 
reaching the merits, in light of the “‘policy of affording
 
17
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
litigants the opportunity to have their cases heard on the 
merits, where possible[.]’” Schefke v. Reliable Collection Agency, Ltd., 96 Hawai' i 408, 420, 32 P.3d 52, 64 (2001) (quoting 
Hous. Fin. and Dev. Corp. v. Ferguson, 91 Hawai' i 81, 85-86, 979 
P.2d 1107, 1111-12 (1999)) (some internal quotation marks and other citation omitted). Additionally, HRAP Rule 2 allows an appellate court, “[i]n the interest of expediting a decision, or for other good cause shown,” to “suspend the requirements or provisions of any of these rules in a particular case . . . and may order proceedings in accordance with its direction.” Thus, in O’Connor v. Diocese of Honolulu, 77 Hawai' i 383, 386, 885 P.2d 
361, 364 (1994), this court, “pursuant to HRAP Rule 2,” “elect[ed]” to “address the issue posed by th[e] appeal[,]” despite its lack of compliance with HRAP Rule 28(b)(4), quoted supra. 
In light of the fact that Respondent does not challenge
 
the facts in the four paragraphs as untrue, this court and the
 ICA have reached the merits notwithstanding a HRAP Rule 28(b)(3)
 violation in other cases, and the instant Application does not
 contain numerous violations, Respondent’s request to dismiss the
 Application is denied. 
V.
 
Respondent’s third argument, that Petitioners misstated
 
the ICA’s opinion in declaring that the ICA found the zero
 general damages award was inconsistent with the evidence, is
 arguable. While Petitioners could have been more precise, lack
 of precision should not result in rejection of the Application. 
18
         
          
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
The ICA stated that “the circuit court saw that the general
 
damages award was inconsistent with the special damages award[.]” 
Kanahele, 2011 WL 1335732, at *2. Petitioners contend that the
 ICA found a zero general damages award to be “inconsistent with
 the evidence,” in the context of arguing that the ICA should have
 found that the nominal award was inconsistent with the evidence. 
(Emphasis added.) Inasmuch as the ICA stated that the court
 found the lack of an award of general damages was inconsistent
 with the amount of special damages, it could be inferred the zero
 general damages award was inconsistent with the evidence. Thus,
 this objection is not discussed further.
 
VI.
 
Turning to the question raised in the Application and
 
20
 that (1) there
 Respondent’s second argument, Petitioners assert  
is a general rule that a new trial must be granted when, as here,
 a jury awards a zero amount in general damages after awarding the
 amount requested in special damages; (2) the court, in effect,
 instructed the jury to return with a nominal amount of general
 damages; (3) the jury’s one dollar award is inconsistent with the
 evidence and requires a new trial; (4) the ICA found that the
 zero general damages award was inconsistent with the evidence and
 therefore it should have found the nominal one dollar award was
 also inconsistent with the evidence; and (5) the transcripts of
 Petitioners’ testimony were unnecessary because “a plaintiff is
 entitled to . . . compensation for pain and suffering if he is

 Petitioners’ arguments are not listed in the order in which they
 
appear in the Application.
 
19
         
        
          
           
           
 
            
         
           
          
         
           
             
            
               
            
            
  
         
          
            
          
             
            
            
         
       
          
          
          
              ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
awarded compensation for his medical expenses[,] because the same
 
evidence is used to prove the medical expenses as [] pain and
 suffering.”
21
 
VII.
 
As to Petitioners’ first assertion, it is well
 
established that “[a] personal injury plaintiff is generally
 entitled to recover damages for all the natural and proximate
 consequences of the defendant’s wrongful act or omission”; “where
 a defendant’s liability to a personal injury plaintiff is
 established, a jury verdict which awards the plaintiff special
 damages but no general damages for pain and suffering is
 generally regarded as improper,” Dunbar, 79 Hawai' i at 314-15, 901 
P.2d at 1293-94,
22 inasmuch as “[t]he inescapable conclusion is
 
21 Petitioners also contend that there is an “appearance of
 
impropriety” when the jury initially awards zero and subsequently awards one
dollar in general damages. Inasmuch as Petitioners fail to explain this
ground, and do not provide any supporting authority, this argument is not
discussed further.
 
22 In Dunbar, the plaintiff had gotten into a fight with a male named 
Thompson while at Burger King (formally called Pentagram Corporation), andsubsequently sued Thompson and Burger King. The jury returned a verdict,awarding the plaintiff $7,000 in special damages and no general damages,finding that Thompson “intentionally or negligently legally caused injury to [the p]laintiff],” and that both Burger King and the plaintiff were negligent. Dunbar, 79 Hawai 'i at 312, 901 P.2d at 1291 (brackets omitted). The jury
found that Burger King’s negligence was not a legal cause of the plaintiff’sinjury, but then attributed 10% of fault to Burger King. Id. at 313, 901 P.2d 
at 1292. The circuit court then entered judgment against Thompson and infavor of the plaintiff for $3,850, and entered judgment in favor of BurgerKing. 
The plaintiff argued that “the jury's special verdict responses as
to [Burger King’s] liability and the amount of Plaintiff's damages were
irreconcilably inconsistent.” Id. at 312, 901 P.2d at 1291. The ICA
 
determined that the verdict was inconsistent as to liability because “there
 was no dispute at trial that [the p]laintiff sustained at least some injury as
a result of the incident[,]” and “the jury's finding that [Burger King] caused
the incident with the jury's finding that [Burger King] did not cause the
injuries that undisputably resulted from the incident” was irreconcilable.
 Id. at 314, 901 P.2d at 1293.
With respect to the inconsistency in the award of special damages
as compared to the general damages issue, the plaintiff had claimed
entitlement to special damages of $4,368.26 for medical expenses and $60,422
for loss of income. The ICA determined that it was unclear what the jury’s
(continued...)
 
20
         
             
            
             
          
              
             
            ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
that the jury awarded . . . medical expenses which [the 
plaintiff] had incurred and failed to award any damages for pain and suffering[,]” Powers v. Johnson, 562 So. 2d 367, 370 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1990). In such circumstances, it may be appropriate to “remand . . . to the trial court for a new trial on the issue of general damages.” Id.; see Smith v. Uhrich, 704 
P.2d 698, 699-700 (Wyo. 1985) (reversing and remanding “for a new trial on the issue of general damages” when the jury returned a verdict finding special damages but no general damages). In a similar vein, the ICA has remanded for a new trial on damages when the parties stipulated to the defendant’s liability, “and the only issue on appeal [wa]s damages[.]” Walsh, 80 Hawai' i at 
196, 907 P.2d at 782. Thus, Petitioner is correct that when an award of special damages indicating physical injury is rendered, a zero award of general damages is improper and generally results in a new trial on general damages when liability is not disputed. 
However, when, as here, “the jury [wa]s still
 
available,” it was within the court’s discretion to determine
 that “resubmitting an inconsistent verdict best comport[ed] with
 the fair and efficient administration of justice.” Duk, 320 F.3d
 
at 1058. Permitting a jury to “correct its own mistakes
 conserves judicial resources and the time and convenience of
 
22(...continued)
a
ward of $7,000 in special damages was meant to encompass, but if the $7,000
included an award for medical expenses, it was inconsistent for the jury not
to award the plaintiff even a small amount for pain and suffering, since both
special damages for medical expenses and general damages for pain and
suffering are largely dependent on the same proof. Id. at 315, 901 P.2d at
 
1294. Because liability and damages were disputed, the ICA remanded for a new
trial on all issues. Id. at 316, 901 P.2d at 1295.
 
21
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
citizen jurors, as well as those of the parties[,]” and allows
 
the case to be resolved “according to the intent of the original
 fact-finder, while that body is still present and able to resolve
 the matter.” Id. Accordingly, the court did not abuse its
 
discretion in resubmitting the damages issue to the jury, rather
 than ordering a new trial, after the zero general damages
 verdict.
 
VIII.
 
Contrary to Petitioners’ second assertion, on
 
resubmittal the court did not instruct the jury to return with a
 nominal amount but, instead, acted within its discretion by
 having the jury return, see Dias, 67 Haw. at 118, 679 P.2d at 136
 (“The preferred remedy of an ambiguous verdict is to have the
 jurors return to clarify the verdict.”), by asking for
 supplemental briefing, and by providing the jury with further
 instruction, see Auwood v. Harry Brandt Booking Office, Inc., 850
 F.2d 884, 891 (2d Cir. 1988) (noting that the trial court has
 discretion to “resubmit the issues to the jury with a request for
 clarification[,]” “whether or not the parties themselves request
 clarification”). As noted supra, the court instructed that
 Petitioners were entitled to damages to compensate Gregory for
 “injuries” incurred. The court properly explained the law, and
 directed the jury to consider Gregory’s injuries, when awarding
 general damages. See Beard v. Flying J, Inc., 266 F.3d 792, 799
 
(8th Cir. 2001) (stating that the trial court “sent the jury back
 for further deliberations” when believing that the jury had 
22
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
rendered an inconsistent verdict). Thus, the court did not “in
 
effect” tell the jury to return with a nominal amount. 
IX.
 
However, as to their third and fourth assertions, 
Petitioners are correct inasmuch as verdicts that award special damages indicative of pain and suffering, but zero or nominal general damages, have been invalidated on the grounds that the general damages award is (1) “inconsistent with the special damages award[,]” (2) “in disregard of the proper instructions of the trial court[,]” (3) “against the great weight of the evidence[,]” or (4) “the result of an improper compromise by jurors unconvinced of liability but willing to compromise their positions in return for a limitation of damages to actual out-of-pocket losses.” Dunbar, 79 Hawai' i at 315, 901 P.2d at 
1294 (internal citations omitted); see also Walsh, 80 Hawai' i at 
194, 907 P.2d at 780 (listing the four reasons). The first three grounds are readily evident in this case. 
A.
 
Petitioners are correct that the return of a $1.00
 
general damages award, in light of a $12,280.41 award of special
 damages for medical treatments, renders the verdict inconsistent
 and requires a new trial on damages. The award of $1.00 was a
 nominal award that did not mitigate the zero award previously
 given, despite the court’s resubmittal of the damages issue to
 the jury. In this case the $1.00 general damages award was the
 symbolic equivalent of a no award verdict that the jury had
 previously rendered. 
23
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
1.
 
While compensatory damages “seek to restore a plaintiff
 
to his or her position prior to the tortious act[,]” nominal 
damages are “a small and trivial sum awarded for a technical injury due to a violation of some legal right and as a consequence of which some damages must be awarded to determine the right.” Zanakis-Pico v. Cutter Dodge, Inc., 98 Hawai' i 309, 
327, 47 P.3d 1222, 1240 (2002) (Acoba, J., concurring) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). “[N]ominal damages are a token award only” and “a vast majority of cases . . . usually adjudge one dollar to be the amount.” Ferreira v. Honolulu 
Star-Bulletin, Ltd., 44 Haw. 567, 579, 356 P.2d 651, 658 (1960); see Black’s Law Dictionary 447 (9th ed. 2009) (defining nominal damages as, inter alia, “[a] trifling sum awarded when no legal injury is suffered but there is no substantial loss or injury to be compensated”). “[N]ominal damages may not exceed $1.00.” Minatoya v. Mousel, 2 Haw. App. 1, 6, 625 P.2d 378, 382 (1981). “Nominal damages means no damages at all[,]” Hall v. Cornett, 240 P.2d 231, 235 (Or. 1952), and are but “a mere peg to hang costs on[,]” Ferreira, 44 Haw. at 579, 356 P.2d at 658. In the instant case, the jury’s verdict of $1.00 was a “small and trivial sum[,]” Zanakis-Pico, 98 Hawai' i at 327, 47 P.3d at 1240 
(2002), inconsistent with medical treatment amounting to over $12,000. 
2.
 
Thus, “[w]e must[] . . . consider the . . . verdict in
 
its entirety as one giving noncompensatory and merely nominal
 
24
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
general damages plus substantial special damages[.]” Hall, 240 
P.2d at 236. When a jury awards special damages but nominal 
general damages, if there is “sufficient evidence to support an award for pain and suffering[,]” the “verdict is characterized as inconsistent[.]” Walsh, 80 Hawai' i at 194, 907 P.2d at 780. In 
the instant case, “sufficient evidence” supporting an award “for pain and suffering” exists, as demonstrated supra, thereby rendering the verdict that awarded nominal general damages but substantial special damages, “inconsistent[.]” Id. Dunbar and 
Walsh are instructive in this regard. 
In part, Dunbar involved a challenge to the jury’s 
award of no general damages as inconsistent with an award of $7,000 special damages and was against the great weight of the evidence. 79 Hawai' i at 313, 901 P.2d at 1292. The ICA reasoned 
that “it was inconsistent for the jury not to award [the p]laintiff even a small amount for pain and suffering,” because “both special damages for medical expenses and general damages for pain and suffering are largely dependent on the same proof.” Id. at 315, 901 P.2d at 1294. Moreover, the verdict went against the great weight of the evidence inasmuch as the “uncontroverted” evidence “adduced at trial” demonstrated that the plaintiff was knocked to the floor and sustained a gash to her head, resulting in “profuse bleeding” and requiring stitches. Id. Because of 
those injuries, the plaintiff “clearly experienced” “pain and suffering[.]” Id. 
Here, “it was inconsistent for the jury,” id., to award 
a nominal amount of $1.00 as general damages inasmuch as “both
 
25
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
special damages for medical expenses and general damages for pain
 
and suffering are largely dependent on the same proof[,]” id. 
The special damages “proof” indicated that Gregory endured pain
 and suffering. The “uncontroverted” evidence from Dr. McLaughlin
 demonstrated that the handlebar of a racer scooter penetrated
 Gregory’s cheek, and by the time he arrived at the hospital, he
 was in “mild to moderate distress and pain” and surgery was
 performed. Medical invoices admitted into evidence also show
 that Gregory was treated for an “open wound[,]” he had a head
 injury, he was given pain killers, he had numerous stitches, and
 he was treated over a period of almost a year. In this regard,
 the court and the ICA should have found the $1.00 award was as
 inconsistent with the evidence as the zero award. 
Additionally, as noted before, Respondent testified
 
that he hit Gregory when driving at the speed of fifteen to
 twenty miles per hour, and as a result of the collision,
 Respondent’s windshield was cracked. Thus, insofar as the
 “proof” indicated that Gregory was struck by a car, was
 consequently injured, incurred surgery and other medical
 treatment therefor, and endured at least mild to moderate
 distress and pain from injuries stemming from the collision, it
 was plainly inconsistent for the jury to award $1.00 in general
 damages. 
Walsh also involved a challenge to a verdict awarding 
the plaintiff $8,600 special damages and no general damages. 80 Hawai'i at 194, 907 P.2d at 780. There, the ICA determined that 
the “damage award [was] inconsistent because in awarding the 
26
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
amount of $6,100 towards medical care, the jury determined that
 
part of [the plaintiff’s] injuries was caused by the accident and
 there was evidence of pain and suffering[.]” Id. The evidence
 
of pain and suffering adduced at trial included a doctor’s
 testimony that the injections, surgery, and post-operative
 recovery were painful. However, if the jury decided the
 injections, surgery, and post operative recovery were not due to
 the injury, “there still [was] sufficient evidence that [the
 plaintiff] experienced pain and suffering to require some award
 of general damages.” Id. at 195, 907 P.2d at 781. 
To that end, the “sufficient evidence” consisted of
 
(1) the “total value” of medical care, which was $6,100 and
 consistent with the jury’s award of that amount for medical care;
 and (2) the jury’s award of $2,500 for lost wages, a month’s pay,
 which was “indicative” of the jury’s conclusion that the
 plaintiff’s injuries “sufficiently disabled him from working[.]” 
Id. The ICA reasoned that, “[b]y awarding special damages for
 
medical expenses, the jury must have determined that [the
 plaintiff] sustained some injury[,]” and therefore “it was
 inconsistent for the jury not to find some pain and suffering”
 for the injury attributable to the accident and “award at least
 some amount for general damages.” Id.
 
Similarly, in the instant case, Dr. McLaughlin’s
 
testimony, Respondent’s testimony, and the medical invoices,
 constituted “sufficient evidence that [Gregory] experienced pain
 and suffering to require some award of general damages”
 “consistent,” id. at 195, 907 P.2d at 781, with the amount
 
27
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
awarded as special damages. Because the verdict was 
inconsistent, “the judgment of the [] court [and the ICA]” are vacated and the case “remand[ed] for a new trial.” Dunbar, 79 
Hawai'i at 316, 901 P.2d at 1295. 
B.
 
As to (2), the jury disregarding the law, Walsh is
 
apposite. There, the ICA determined that the jury disregarded
 the law because, in light of the instructions that are similar to
 the instant case, the plaintiff was entitled to general damages
 adequately compensating him for, inter alia, his injuries,
 medical services, and pain and suffering. Here, as in Walsh, the
 court instructed the jury that if Respondent was liable,
 Petitioners were to be awarded damages for pain and suffering. 
However, here the jury gave only $1.00 for pain and suffering,
 thereby disregarding the court’s instruction that the jury was to
 consider “the extent and nature of the injuries received,” “the
 reasonable value of the medical services provided,” and “the
 pain, emotional suffering and disability” incurred by Gregory. 
Demonstrating the jury’s disregard of the court’s directive was
 the jury communication asking what the “minimum” award required
 under the law was, indicating that the jury was not considering
 fair and adequate compensation for Gregory, but seeking to
 reinstate its first verdict of zero to the extent possible. 
Thus, it can be inferred reasonably that the jury disregarded the
 court’s instruction on damages.

great weight of the evidence, as contained in Dr. McLaughlin’s
 
testimony, Respondent’s testimony, and the medical invoices. 
However, Respondent contends that Petitioners’ failure to provide
 the court with all supporting and contradictory
23 references
 
requires rejection of the Application, relying on what Respondent
 views as “cogent[]” language from the ICA opinion:
 
The burden is upon appellant in an appeal to show
error by reference to matters in the record, and he has the
responsibility of providing an adequate transcript.
Moreover, if the appellant wishes to urge that a finding or
conclusion is unsupported by the evidence, he must include a
transcript of all the evidence relevant to such finding or
conclusion.
 
. . . .
 The law is clear in this jurisdiction that the
appellant has the burden of furnishing the appellate court
with a sufficient record to positively show the alleged
error. An appellant must include in the record all of the
evidence on which the lower court might have based its
findings and if this is not done, the lower court must be
affirmed.

Corp. v. Kakaako Corp., 5 Haw. App. 146, 151–52, 682 P.2d 82, 87
 (1984) (ellipsis in original)) (citations and emphasis omitted). 
However, that language was used in rejecting Petitioners’
 contention that there was “error” as to liability when the jury
 found Kanahele 10% liable and Gregory 45% liable. Id. 
Understandably, transcripts of the parties, “which would likely
 have provided evidence as to alleged liability,” id., may be
 necessary in determining that the apportionment of liability was
 appropriate. However, this issue is not raised in the
 Application; the only issue is whether the general damages award
 was proper and, as set forth supra, there is a “sufficient record

 Respondent does not indicate what “contradictory” evidence exists.

In connection with Petitioners’ fifth assertion, the 
ICA determined that without transcripts of Gregory’s, 
Trishalynn’s, and Kanahele’s testimonies, it had an insufficient basis to conclude that the jury’s award was inconsistent with the evidence. Kanahele, 2011 WL 1335732, at *3. However, under the 
circumstances of this case, these transcripts were unnecessary to conclude that the general damages award was improper. To reiterate, in the instant case, there was “probative evidence” of Gregory’s pain and suffering in the form of Dr. McLaughlin’s testimony, Respondent’s testimony, and the medical invoices, as discussed supra, to reasonably justify compensation in excess of $1.00. See Walsh, 80 Hawai' i at 195, 907 P.2d at 781 (stating 
that the testimony of a doctor, combined with the medical records, amounted to sufficient evidence of pain and suffering). 
A zero award of general damages may be allowed to
 
stand, despite an award of special damages, when “the evidence
 indicate[d] a dispute over the amount of claimed special
 damages[]” such that “the zero-general-damages verdict [i]s
 evidence of the jury's intent to include in the special damages
 award an amount for pain and suffering[,]” or “there is no
 probative evidence that the plaintiff incurred pain and suffering
 as a consequence of the defendant’s act[,]” or “where the only
 evidence of pain and suffering is the plaintiff's subjective
 testimony, which the jury could reasonably have concluded was

exaggerated or lacking in credibility.” Dunbar, 79 Hawai' i at 
316, 901 P.2d at 1295 (citations omitted). None of those 
circumstances exist here. Indeed, Respondent conceded on the record after the jury’s zero general damages award that the general damages award was inconsistent with the special damages award. 
Consequently, Petitioners met their burden of
 
“furnishing the appellate court with a sufficient record to
 positively show the alleged error.” Union Bldg. Materials, 5
 
Haw. App. at 151, 682 P.2d at 87. The award of $1.00 was, at the
 least, “inconsistent” with the evidence and, contrary to the
 ICA’s SDO in this regard, the testimonies of Petitioners were not
 necessary to reach that determination.
24 Thus, the ICA gravely
 
erred in concluding the evidence was insufficient to decide
 whether a $1.00 general damages award was inconsistent with the
 special damages award.

Based on the foregoing, the April 27, 2011 judgment of
 
the ICA is reversed, the April 24, 2009 judgment of the court is
 affirmed, except the damages award is vacated, and the case is 
24
 Of course, insofar as the transcript testimony of Trishalynn and
 
Kanahele related to their own claims of emotional distress, the transcripts
would not be germane to Gregory’s general damages claim.

 In their Application, Petitioners requested remand on the issue of 
damages. Proof of special damages may be interrelated with proof of general 
damages. As observed in Dunbar, “both special damages for medical expenses
and general damages for pain and suffering are largely dependent on the sameproof[.]” 79 Hawai 'i at 315, 901 P.2d at 1294. Thus, in the instant case, we
remand for a new trial on special and general damages.
