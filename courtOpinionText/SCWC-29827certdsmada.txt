Petitioners/Respondents-Appellants Dan Deigert and Edith Deigert,

 Living Trust dated April 22, 2006, was filed more than thirty
 days after the filing of the February 10, 2012 judgment on appeal
 filed by the Intermediate Court of Appeals. The application is
 untimely and thus, this court lacks appellate jurisdiction. See
 
HRS ยง 602-59(c) (Supp. 2011); HRAP Rule 40.1(a). Therefore, 
   
  IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the application for writ of
