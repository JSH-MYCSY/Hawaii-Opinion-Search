SANFORD IWATA, Petitioner/Defendant-Appellee.
 
CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
(ICA NO. 29851; CIVIL NO. 07-1-36)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
We hold that inasmuch as the Circuit Court of the Third
 
1
Circuit (the court)  granted summary judgment to Petitioner/
Defendant-Appellee Sanford Iwata (Defendant) apparently as to all
 
theories of liability and with respect to all his capacities
 alleged in the amended complaint, in focusing on negligence and
 on wilful and wanton misconduct in Defendant’s position as a co­employee of Respondent/Plaintiff-Appellant Francisco Abadilla,

 The Honorable Greg K. Nakamura presided.
          
            
 ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Jr. (Plaintiff), the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) erred in
 
vacating summary judgment without determining whether summary
 judgment was appropriately granted or not with respect to the
 other said theories of liability and the other capacities of
 Defendant.
 
Defendant seeks review of the March 15, 2013 ICA
 
judgment filed pursuant to its January 31, 2013 Memorandum
 Opinion, and the Order of Correction filed on March 15, 2013,
 vacating and remanding the Final Judgment filed by the court
 entered on April 28, 2009.
 
I. 
A.
 
The essential facts taken from the ICA’s opinion
 
follow.
2 “[Plaintiff] was employed by Sanford’s Service Center,
 
Inc. (SSC). . . . SSC operated a rock quarry . . . and was in the
 business of supplying gravel, cinder, and soil. [Defendant] was
 the president and general manager of SSC and a co-employee of
 [Plaintiff]. [Defendant’s] duties included serving as a
 supervisor, mechanic, job estimator, laborer, trainer, safety
 compliance officer, equipment operator, and driver. [Defendant]
 was responsible for safety training and compliance and took care
 of ‘most of the maintenance and the field work.’ As the operator
 of the rock quarry, SSC was governed by federal Mine Safety

Health Administration (MSHA) regulations, and [Defendant] held a
 
mining training certificate.” Abadilla v. Iwata, No. 29851, 2013
 
WL 377301, at *1 (App. Jan. 31, 2013) (mem.). 
“As part of its business, SSC owned and used a[n] . . .
 
[Impactor] to crush larger rocks into smaller rocks or aggregate. 
[Plaintiff] was trained by [Defendant] regarding the maintenance
 of the Impactor. The Impactor crushed rocks as follows: Rocks
 were fed by a chute into the inner chamber of the Impactor, which
 contained a rotating impeller shaft to which metal bars [(known
 as “blow bars”)] were attached. . . . [T]he rotating impeller
 would hit the rocks against fixed breaker plates causing the
 rocks to fracture into smaller pieces. The metal bars were held
 in place with wedges or chocks designed to prevent them from
 coming out during operation. The chamber was lined with high-
chrome tiles that were bolted down. While in operation, the
 cover to the chamber was kept closed[.]” Id. 
“During a prior incident which occurred several months
 
before [Plaintiff] sustained his injuries . . . , the Impactor
 malfunctioned and ‘exploded,’ causing major damage to the
 Impactor.” Id. at *2. “After the explosion, [Plaintiff]
 
observed that the cover to the Impactor had opened up, and that
 pieces of the bar assembly were ‘all over the place.’ Jack Lee
 (Lee), an employee of SSC, believed that the explosion occurred
 when one of the blow bars ‘got loose’ in the Impactor. As a
 result of the malfunction/explosion, the impeller shaft, blow
 bars, and other parts of the machine were cracked or damaged and
 
3
          ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
a metal piece attached to the impeller shaft had broken off.” 
Id. 
“There is no indication that [Defendant] or SSC sought
 
assistance from the manufacturer of the Impactor . . . or others
 in determining the exact cause of the Impactor’s malfunction/
 explosion. The damage to the Impactor was repaired in-house by
 SSC with the assistance of an outside welder[.]” Id. “At
 
[Defendant’s] direction, [the welder] welded a metal piece . . .
 onto the impeller shaft and fixed other cracks[.]” Id. “The
 
welds were not tested[.]” Id. 
“[Plaintiff] and other employees were instructed to
 
weld worn locking wedges holding the metal bars in place, rather
 than replacing them with new locking wedges and bolts. 
[Plaintiff] warned [Defendant] that this practice was unsafe.” 
Id. “[A] foreman at the company that previously owned the
 
Impactor . . . explained that welding the wedges . . . would
 limit their usefulness and that the parts . . . would probably
 not ‘stay tight.’” Id. 
“After the Impactor was placed back into service, . . .
 
the bearings holding the impeller shaft would run hot. 
[Defendant] was aware of this[.]” Id. “[Defendant] instructed
 
[Plaintiff] to grease the Impactor every thirty minutes while the
 machine was running to get a better coverage with the grease, and
 so that the greasing would not slow down the process of crushing
 rock. [Defendant’s] instruction was contrary to MSHA
 regulations, which generally require that maintenance and repair
 
4
          ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
on a machine only be performed after the power is off[.]” Id. 
“It was also contrary to the operating manual for the Impactor
 
[that] . . . warned against over-lubrication because ‘[t]oo much
 lubrication will cause abnormally high operating temperatures.’ 
[Defendant] was not aware of these . . . MSHA regulations and the
 operating manual.” Id. 
“On the day that [Plaintiff] was injured, he was
 
greasing the Impactor while it was running in accordance with
 [Defendant’s] instructions. . . . [T]he Impactor again ‘exploded’
 and metal parts from within the Impactor flew outside the
 machine. [Plaintiff] was hit in the stomach by metal parts or
 pieces that broke off and were expelled from the Impactor,
 allegedly causing severe bodily injuries.” Id. at *3. A co­
worker “observed that the cover to the Impactor had been blown
 open during the explosion. Metal parts . . . to the impeller
 shaft had broken off, and . . . metal pieces . . . of the blow
 bars as well as the wedges or chocks, were outside the machine on
 the ground. [The co-worker] concluded that a blow bar that came
 loose or cracked caused the Impactor to explode, because a metal
 piece that fell inside the Impactor would cause damage to the
 machine.” Id. “Prior to the explosion . . . one or two of the
 
locks designed to hold the cover to the Impactor in place were
 missing or broken. According to [Plaintiff], . . . the parts
 that had been welded after the prior malfunction incident came
 apart while the Impactor was running.” Id.

grossly negligent manner and/or with a conscious
indifference to the safety of [Plaintiff.]
 
(Emphases added.) 
II.
 
A.
 
1.
 
On the motion for summary judgment as to Count I,
 
4
Defendant argued that pursuant to HRS § 386-8 (1993)  and Iddings
v. Mee-Lee, 82 Hawai' i 1, 919 P.2d 263 (1996), “employer immunity 
from negligence actions . . . is furthered by extension of immunity to co-employee suits based on negligence[,]” and thus, Defendant, as a co-employee, was immune from suit by Plaintiff. (Emphasis omitted.) Additionally, Defendant submitted an affidavit indicating “the impactor . . . is owned by [SSC,]” “he did not provide the impactor . . . to [Plaintiff,]” and “the property upon which [Plaintiff] . . . was allegedly injured was owned, possessed and/or controlled by [SSC.]” 
Plaintiff briefly responded as to Count I that “[t]o
 
the extent that [Defendant] is moving to dismiss any claims other
 than those based on negligence of a co-employee, he should be
 denied.”
 
4
 HRS § 386-8 states, in relevant part, that “[a]nother employee of
 
the same employer shall not be relieved of his liability as a third party, if
the personal injury is caused by his wilful and wanton misconduct.”
 
7
          ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
In his Reply, Defendant pointed out that as to “claims
 
against [Defendant] . . . on his alleged negligence as a co­
employee[, Defendant] does not oppose the dismissal of such
 claims pursuant to [HRS] § 386-8[,]” and that Plaintiff “failed
 to come forward with specific facts showing . . . there remains a
 genuine issue of fact with respect to” Defendant “not provid[ing]
 the impactor[,]” and Defendant “not own[ing], possess[ing],
 and/or control[ling] the property on which the accident
 occurred.”
 
2.
 
On the motion for summary judgment as to Count III,
 
Defendant maintained that based on Iddings, he had immunity from
 suit as a co-employee for negligently (1) inspecting,
 maintaining, or repairing the impactor, and (2) ensuring properly
 trained personnel operated the impactor. Defendant also argued
 that the allegation that as president of SSC, Defendant was
 liable for the conduct described above in (1) and (2), and for
 (3) supervising Plaintiff, and (4) ensuring safety procedures was
 followed in the operation, maintenance, and repair of the
 machinery, was barred by case law. 
In his Memorandum, Defendant stated that “[c]ourts
 
around the country have ruled that supervisory employees cannot
 be sued for a failure to provide a safe work place to the injured
 employee. The employer owes a non[-]delegable duty to provide a
 safe work environment. . . . The duty of proper supervision is a 
8
          ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
duty owed by a corporate officer or supervisory employee to the
 
employer, not to a fellow employee.” 
According to Defendant, “[t]he rationale of this
 
principle ‘is that workers’ compensation is the exclusive remedy
 against an employer and, if there is a failure of an officer or
 employee to perform a duty owed to the employer, the employee’s
 recourse is solely against the employer. When an officer or
 supervisor fails to perform the employer’s duty, the failure is
 that of the employer, not the officer or supervisor.’” (Quoting
 Laffin v. Chemical Supply Co., 253 N.W.2d 51, 53 (Wis. 1977).) 
Defendant thus maintained he was entitled to summary judgment
 because any failures must be attributable to SSC, and not
 Defendant. 
In response, Plaintiff maintained that “Defendant
 
undertook certain responsibilities that transcended his duties as
 a corporate officer.” Defendant’s Response to Interrogatory
 states that “[his] duties and responsibilities are Mechanic
 (registered), supervisor . . . , trainer . . . [and] [s]afety
 compliance.” (Emphases omitted.) Additionally, a report by SSC
 to the MSHA states that Defendant is the “Person with Overall
 Responsibility for a Health and Safety Program in All of the
 Operator’s Mines.” 
In a further interrogatory, Defendant answered that he
 
was one of the persons “responsible for the inspection and/or
 maintenance and/or repair of the subject machine[.]” Emphasis
 omitted.) According to Plaintiff, Defendant “was the employee of
 
9
          
           ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
SSC who had specific, admitted responsibilities [for] which
 
Plaintiff is alleging he was grossly negligent[.]” 
With respect to the non-delegable duty of providing a
 
safe workplace, Plaintiff contended that Athas v. Hill, 476 A.2d
 710 (Ct. App. Md. 1984), cited by Defendant, holds that “if a
 corporate office or supervisory employee is also a coemployee,
 the injured employee may maintain an action against the officer
 or employee. But if the officer or supervisor is merely acting
 on behalf of the employer in his capacity as a corporate officer,
 a personal action against him may not be maintained.”
5 He also
 
stated that Kruse v. Schieve, 213 N.W.2d 64 (Wis. 1973), cited by
 Defendant, indicated that “‘[i]f the corporate officer . . . had
 not personally directed the particular operation to be done in a
 particular manner, there would have been no basis for holding
 that he had become a coemployee and owed a common-law duty to a
 fellow employee under the circumstances.’” (Quoting Kruse, 213
 N.W.2d at 68.)
 
On December 8, 2008, the court granted Defendant
 
summary judgment on Counts I and III.
 
B.
 In his Motion for Summary Judgment on Count V,
 
Defendant argued that to impose punitive damages against
 Defendant, “Plaintiff must prove by clear and convincing
 evidence, that there was a positive element of conscious wrong
 
5
 The quote in Athas could not be located based on the citation.
 
10
          ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
doing, on the part of Defendant.” According to Defendant,
 
“Plaintiff does not allege any positive element of conscious
 wrongdoing” because Plaintiff alleges negligent acts, negligent
 omissions, and carrying on abnormally dangerous activity. 
(Emphasis in original.) Further, Defendant reiterated that he
 did not provide the impactor, own or possess the property on
 which the incident took place, and was not responsible for
 fulfilling the non-delegable duty of SSC to provide a safe place
 to work or safe machinery.
 
In his Memorandum in Opposition, Plaintiff maintained
 
that, based on the court’s Instruction No. 8.12, a defendant is
 subject to punitive damages when he “acted intentionally,
 willfully, wantonly, oppressively, or with gross negligence.” 
Further, Instruction No. 8.13 defines “wilful” as,
 
inter alia, “indifference to . . . natural consequences.” 
Plaintiff asserted that Defendant was indifferent to the natural
 consequences of welding broken parts rather than using new parts,
 failing to disclose to the manufacturer’s representative the
 prior explosion and makeshift repairs, failing to disclose to the
 MSHA inspector the prior explosion, and ordering greasing of the
 impactor while it ran. 
Attached to Plaintiff’s memorandum was a declaration by
 
Plaintiff which indicated Defendant had contact with Plaintiff in
 connection with the incident, and that welding used parts caused
 the impactor to explode. The declaration stated, in part, that:
 
11
          
        
          
 
       
          
      
       
         
   
        
         
          
        
       
         
   
        
         
         
         
       
    
            
         
        
         
        
    
        
       
        
 
 ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
5. [Defendant] showed [Plaintiff] how to apply grease
while the impactor was running, and in fact, ordered me to
do so.
 
6. 
[
Defendant] told [Plaintiff] to grease the
impactor while it was still running so that it would not
slow down the process of crushing rock.
 
. . . .
 
8
. Prior to [Plaintiff’s] accident, the impactor
exploded resulting in the shaft, blow bars and other parts
breaking. . . .
9. [Defendant] also instructed me and other employees
to weld worn locking wedges in place instead of replacing
the used and worn locking wedges and its locking bolts with
new and safer locking wedges and bolts after [Plaintiff]
informed [Defendant] on numerous occasions that these new
wedges and bolts were needed because the worn parts were
unsafe. . . .
 
10. After the aforesaid parts were welded, the
impactor did not run smoothly but would vibrate and the
bearings holding the shaft would run hot. [Defendant] was
 aware of this. That is the reason why [Defendant]
instructed [Plaintiff] to apply grease to the machine
continuously . . . .
11. 
. 
. . photographs of the impactor . . . showed
the shaft, blow bars and other parts of the impactor
discussed above after the explosion. Those photographs show
that the shaft assembly broke where it had previously been
welded by the other employee and the outside welding
contractor . . . .
 
. . . .
 
1
7. In [Plaintiff’s] opinion, the cause of the
explosion was because the parts that were previously
repaired by welding came apart while the impactor was
running.
 
In his Reply, Defendant contends “[Plaintiff] fail[ed]
 
to respond by affidavit or otherwise setting forth specific facts
 
showing a genuine issue of material fact with respect to his
 claim for punitive damages[,]” and that instructions are not
 court-approved. (Citing K.M. Young & Assocs. v. Cieslik, 4 Haw.
 App. 657, 675 P.2d 793 (1983).) Rather, he maintains “[i]n
 contrast, to justify an award of punitive damages, ‘a positive
 element of conscious wrongdoing is always required . . .,’”
 (citing Masaki v. General Motors Corp., 71 Haw. 1, 7, 780 P.2d
 566, 570-571 (1989)), and Defendant “did not own or provide the .
 . . impactor[,]” “did not own, possess or control the property
 
12
          ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
upon which the accident occurred[,] and “[t]he duties that were
 
alleged breached . . . as the basis of Count III . . . were non[­]delegable duties of [SCC] and . . . not duties . . . owed by
 [Defendant].” 
On December 8, 2008, the court granted summary judgment
 
in favor of Defendant as to Count V. 
III.
 
The ICA issued its Memorandum Opinion on January 31, 
2013, and vacated the court’s grant of summary judgment against Plaintiff as to Counts I, III, and V of the First Amended Complaint. Abadilla, 2013 WL 377301, at *1. In its analysis, 
the ICA first stated that there was no dispute that Plaintiff sustained a work-related injury and Defendant was Plaintiff’s co­employee. Id. at *4. Under Iddings, the ICA noted, Hawai' i’s 
workers’ compensation law, HRS Chapter 386, bars suits by an injured worker against co-employees on a theory of negligence. Id. However, it held that, also pursuant to Iddings, HRS §§ 
386-5 (1993) and 386-8 do not bar suit and establishment of liability on a theory of wilful and wanton misconduct. Id. 
Thus, the ICA focused in its decision on “whether there were genuine issues of material fact concerning whether Plaintiff was injured as the result of [Defendant’s] wilful and wanton misconduct.” Id. 
The ICA reviewed the test set out by this court in
 
Iddings for the “wilful and wanton misconduct” exception to co­employee immunity in HRS § 386-8, and applying the test to the
 
13
          
         
      
      
         
   ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
facts of the instant case, as well as analogizing to the facts in
 
Iddings, the ICA concluded that “when the evidence is viewed in
 the light most favorable to Plaintiff, there were genuine issues
 of material fact regarding whether [Defendant] engaged in wilful
 and wanton misconduct . . . .” Id. at *5. The ICA thus held,
 
“the [ c]ourt erred in granting summary judgment in favor of
 [Defendant] on Counts I and III.” Id. at *7.
 
The ICA next addressed Count V, quoting this court’s 
statement in Iddings that “‘tortious conduct meriting the imposition of punitive damages and tortious conduct falling within the exception to co-employee immunity in HRS § 386-8 are measured by similar terms[.]’” Id. at *7 (quoting Iddings, 82 
Hawai'i at 9 n.6, 919 F.2d at 271 n.6). On this basis, the ICA 
concluded that “[b]ased on our analysis that there were genuine issues of material fact regarding whether [Defendant] engaged in wilful and wanton misconduct which caused [Plaintiff’s] injuries, we conclude that there were also genuine issues of material fact regarding [Plaintiff’s] claim for punitive damages.” Id. 
The ICA vacated the court’s judgment as to Counts I,
 
III, and V. Id. 
IV.
 
Defendant presents the following questions in his
 
Application:
 
1.	 Whether the ICA erred in vacating the entry of
judgement against [Plaintiff] on Count I ( negligent
providing a defective impactor machine and negligent
permitting a hazard known to exist on the premises) of
the first amended complaint.
 
14
          
        
      
      
      
       
       
 
         
       
     
      
      
         
           
           
           
         
          
          
          
        
      ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
2.	 Whether the ICA erred in vacating the entry of
judgment against [Plaintiff] on Count III ( negligent
failed to properly inspect and/or maintain and/or
repair the subject impactor machine and negligent
failed to ensure that only properly trained personnel
operated the subject impactor machine) of the first
amended complaint.
 
3.	 Whether the ICA erred in vacating the entry of
judgment against [Plaintiff] on Count V (punitive
damages) of the first amended complaint.
 
(Emphases added.)
 
On April 29, 2013, Plaintiff filed an “Answer” which
 
very briefly and generally argued that Defendant failed to cite
 
“grave errors of law or fact or obvious inconsistencies with
 controlling case law, [and that] Defendant essentially argued”
 the ICA “did not interpret or apply 
Iddings[] , 82 Hawai' i 1, 919 
P.2d 263 [], as Petitioner argued.” 
On May 6, 2013, Defendant filed a Reply essentially
 
reiterating his positions before the court and the ICA. 
V.
 
The standard to apply on a motion for summary judgment
 
is as follows:
 
Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there
is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law . A
fact is material if proof of that fact would have the effect
of establishing or refuting one of the essential elements of
a cause of action or defense asserted by the parties. The
evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the
non-moving party. In other words, we must view all of the
evidence and inferences drawn therefrom in the light most
favorable to the party opposing the motion.

P.3d 1054, 1059 (2006)) (citation omitted). Thus, “in reviewing summary judgment decisions an appellate court steps into the shoes of the trial court and applies the same legal standard as the trial court applied.” Id. (quoting id.) (other citation omitted). 
VI.
 
With respect to the first question, Defendant makes
 
three arguments concerning Count I. 
A.
 
Defendant first argues that he “did not provide the
 
impactor machine for use by [Plaintiff] or own the property on
 which it was operated.” According to Defendant, Plaintiff
 “concedes that he was employed by SSC and that the subject . . .
 machine was owned by SSC at the [relevant] time[.]” [Id.] 
Defendant “did not provide the . . . machine for use by
 [Plaintiff]” and Defendant “did not own, possess or control the
 property on which [Plaintiff] was working[,]” but was “possessed
 and/or controlled by SSC, [Plaintiff’s] employer.” Indeed, the
 
16
          ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
amended complaint alleged that at the time of the incident the
 
“machine [was] owned by [SSC] which was being used to crush rock
 on property owned by Doe Defendants.” Thus, Defendant is correct
 insofar as the complaint did not allege that Defendant, in his
 individual capacity, owned the machine. Rather, it was averred
 that SSC owned the machine and that “Doe Defendants” rather than
 [Defendant] owned the premises. 
The ICA did not determine whether there were any
 
genuine issues of material fact regarding Defendant’s declaration
 that he did not own the impactor, that he did not provide the
 impactor, and that he did not own or possess the property on
 which the incident took place, in connection with the
 allegations. If there were no genuine issues of material fact
 regarding these issues, then Defendant would be entitled to
 summary judgment as to such claims of liability. Thus, insofar
 as the ICA vacated summary judgment, see Abadilla, 2013 WL
 377301, at *7, it did so without deciding to what extent such
 acts were encompassed within its holding. The ICA did not make
 any determination as to whether there were genuine issues of
 material fact or if these issues were determined by law in
 vacating the court’s summary judgment order as to Count I in its
 entirety. 
B.
 
Second, Defendant argues “[HRS] § 386-8 precludes
 
claims for negligence against [Defendant]” because Plaintiff and
 
17
          
         
       
         
         
        
          
       
   
       
        
         
        ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Defendant “were employed by SSC and were co-employees.” He cites
 
to that part of the statute which reads as follows:
 
When a work injury for which compensation is payable under
this chapter has been sustained under the circumstances
creating in some person other than the employer or another
employee of the employer acting in the course of his
employment a legal liability to pay damages on account
thereof; the injured employee or his dependents . . . may
claim compensation under this chapter and recover damages
from such third person.
 
(Emphasis in original) (Citing HRS § 386-8). Further, he states
 
that the Hawai' i Supreme Court has declared that: 
[O]ne of the primary purposes underlying the implementation
of a workers’ compensation scheme in Hawai 'i was to 
eliminate suits based on negligence in the work-place and tospread the costs of work-related injuries over the industry. 
(Citing Iddings v. Mee-Lee, 82 Hawai' i 1, 7-8, 919 P.2d 263, 269­
270 (1996).) 
Defendant maintains that “since [Plaintiff’s] claims in
 
Count I against his co-employee [Defendant] are based solely on
 
[Defendant’s] negligence[,]” “[t]he ICA erred in vacating the
 entry of judgment against [Plaintiff] on Count I[.]” To the
 contrary, the ICA held that Defendant, as a co-employee of
 Plaintiff, was protected from liability based on a theory of
 negligence. Abadilla, 2013 WL 377301, at *7. However, the ICA
 
made no separate determination as to whether a genuine issue of
 material fact existed regarding whether Defendant was liable to
 Plaintiff based on a theory of negligence in a capacity other
 than that as co-employee, such as President of SSC or owner of
 the land where the incident occurred.
 
18
          ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
C.
 
Third, Defendant alleges he “is entitled to judgment
 
with respect to Count I” on the ground that “any genuine issue of
 
material fact related to . . . the alleged improper repair and
 maintenance of the Impactor and the alleged improper instruction
 to grease the machine while running is not pertinent to [the]
 allegation in Count I . . . and permitting a [] hazard . . . on
 property allegedly under his ownership, possession, or control.” 
However, the ICA did not determine whether there were genuine
 issues of material fact regarding whether Defendant owned the
 impactor, provided the impactor to Plaintiff, or owned or
 possessed the property in question or if these issues were
 determined by law in its vacation of the court’s summary judgment
 order as to Count I in its entirety.
 
VII.
 
With respect to the second question, Defendant
 
maintains “[t]he ICA erred in vacating the entry of judgment
 against [Plaintiff] on Count III[.]” His first contention is
 that HRS § 386-8 precludes claims for negligence with respect to
 “inspect[ing] and/or maintain[ing] and/or repair[ing] the . . .
 machine; and/or ensur[ing] . . . properly train[ing] personnel
 [who] operated the . . . impactor[.]” Defendant points out that
 Plaintiff “merely asserts a claim for negligence in Count II” and
 Defendant, “as a co-employee of [Plaintiff], is immune from 
19
          ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
negligence actions.” (Quoting Iddings, 82 Hawai' i 1, 919 P.2d 
263.) 
Additionally, according to Defendant, Plaintiff
 
“alleges in Count III” that Defendant, as president of SSC, “was
 
responsible for carrying out the employer’s general obligation of
 providing a reasonably safe place to work and furnish reasonably
 safe . . . machinery.” As noted before, Defendant maintained
 that “‘workers’ compensation is the exclusive remedy against an
 employer and, if there is a failure of an officer or employee to
 perform a duty owed to the employer, the employee’s recourse
 [such as plaintiff’s] is solely against the employer [such as
 SSC].’” (Citing Laffin, 253 N.W.2d at 53.) Thus, Defendant
 argues the “supervisory employees cannot be sued for a failure to
 provide a safe work place to the injured employee.” “[T]he
 duties [Plaintiff] alleges that [Defendant] breached were duties
 owed by SSC and not a co-employee.” 
This argument was raised in Defendant’s memorandum in
 
support of his motions for summary judgment at trial and in his
 Answering Brief before the ICA. However, the ICA did not decide
 whether genuine issues of material fact existed as to this
 defense or whether the defense failed as a matter of law in
 vacating the court’s summary judgment order in its entirety. 
Further, with respect to Count III, Defendant argues
 
that Plaintiff’s “arguments of wilful and wanton misconduct on
 the part of [Defendant] is misplaced.” Defendant asserts that
 
20
          ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
“Defendant’s knowledge of the risk of injury to [Plaintiff]
 
stemming from the alleged improper repair and maintenance of the
 Impactor and the alleged improper instruction to . . . grease the
 machine while running has no bearing on this case because there
 is no evidence” that the alleged misconduct “caused the machine
 to malfunction.” According to Defendant, he “established that
 there was no evidence to support [Plaintiff’s] assertion that”
 these matters “caused the Impactor to malfunction,” because
 Plaintiff presented no expert testimony or evidence to establish”
 liability that these matters “caused the Impactor to
 malfunction.”
 
Defendant declares that “[Plaintiff’s] concession that
 
he essentially did not know whether the repair or maintenance of
 the machine caused his injuries were made after the trial court
 initially heard [Defendant’s] motion for summary judgment and
 gave [Plaintiff] approximately 5 months to supplement his
 position[.]” Rather, Defendant points out that Plaintiff “relies
 on his own lay opinion that ‘the cause of the explosion was
 because the parts that were previously repaired by welding came
 apart while the impactor was running.’” 
This argument was raised before the court in
 
Defendant’s memorandum in support of his motion for summary
 judgment and in Defendant’s Answering Brief before the ICA. 
However, the ICA did not expressly determine whether genuine
 issues of material fact remained as to this defense, or whether
 
21
          ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the defense failed as a matter of law in vacating the court’s
 
summary judgment order as to Count III in its entirety. 
VIII.
 
Finally, Defendant asserts “the ICA erred in vacating
 
the entry of judgment against [Plaintiff] on Count V (punitive
 damages).” As to this claim, Defendant argues that Plaintiff
 “does not allege a positive element of conscious wrongdoing on
 the part of [Defendant].” Defendant maintains a “claim of wilful
 and wanton misconduct” is “[in]sufficient to preserve . . .
 punitive damages.” Moreover, Defendant declares Plaintiff is
 “incapable of presenting evidence to support his claim of wilful
 and wanton misconduct” by Defendant on the grounds set forth
 above.
 
Based on Iddings, wilful and wanton conduct of a co­
employee may give rise to punitive damages. Iddings, 82 Hawai' i 
at 8, 919 P.2d at 270. Accordingly, as to Count V, the ICA did not gravely err in deciding summary judgment must be vacated as to that count inasmuch as the ICA decided genuine issues of material fact existed for such conduct. 
IX.
 
The court entered summary judgment orders on Counts I,
 
III and V. Accordingly, the court orders granted summary
 judgment for Defendant on all theories of liability and in all
 capacities alleged in the amended complaint with respect to the
 said counts. In its holding, the ICA vacated the summary
 
22
          
          
         
       
            
             ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
judgment orders in their entirety. Abadilla, 2013 WL 377301, at
 
*7. However, the ICA only decided that there were genuine issues
 
of material fact regarding the alleged wilful and wanton conduct
 of Defendant in his capacity as a co-employee. Presumably, this
 is because the ICA determined that under Iddings, HRS § 386-8
 allowed actions against a co-employee for wilful and wanton
 misconduct. Id. at *5. 
Hence, the ICA did not decide whether genuine issues of
 
material fact existed or not regarding the other theories of
 liability alleged and other capacities in which Defendant acted,
 as alleged in the amended complaint.
6 Yet, the ICA vacated the
 
entirety of the orders granting summary judgment on Counts I and
 III. See id., at *7. In doing so, the ICA did not address, for
 
example, Defendant’s argument that he was not liable as an
 officer or as a supervisor for furnishing a safe place to work
 and reasonably safe machinery, or that there was no expert
 testimony that the alleged acts of Defendant caused the Impactor
 to malfunction. As to this last defense, it is also unclear
 whether the question of wilful and wanton misconduct would be
 abrogated by the question of causation, i.e. whether the conduct
 of Defendant was not the cause of the impactor exploding, as
 posed by the Defendant. Therefore, the case is remanded to the
 
6
 Defendant was “the president and general manager of SSC and co­
employee of [Plaintiff],” who served as “supervisor, mechanic, job estimator,
laborer, trainer, safety compliance officer, equipment operator, and
driver[,]” and “responsible for safety training and compliance and . . . ‘most
 of the maintenance and the field work.’” Abadilla , 2013 WL 377301, at *1.
 
23
          
  
 
 ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
ICA to decide, wilful and wanton liability aside, 1) what other
 
theories of liability, if any, were subject to summary judgment
 and 2) in what capacities, that of co-employee aside, Defendant
 was entitled to summary judgment, if any.
