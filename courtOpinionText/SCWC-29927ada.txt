OPINION OF THE COURT BY ACOBA, J.
 
We hold that the Family Court of the Fifth Circuit (the
 
1
court) was foreclosed from modifying the Decree Granting Divorce
and Child Custody as to the apportioned liability for capital
 
gains taxes between Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant David Yukimura
 (Petitioner) and Respondent/Plaintiff-Appellee Emily Thomas-
Yukimura (Respondent), because the circumstances herein did not

permit such modification under Hawai' i Family Court Rules (HFCR) 
Rule 52(b), Rule 59, or Rule 60.2 3 
4
The Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA)  affirmed the
court’s order modifying the decree. In light of the court’s
 
aforesaid error, we vacate its June 4, 2009 “Order on
 [Respondent’s] and [Petitioner’s] Motions for Post-Decree Relief”
 (Order on Post-Decree Relief) and the February 12, 2013 judgment
 of the ICA affirming the said Order on Post-Decree Relief. 
We
 
remand the case to the court with instructions to reinstate the
 September 26, 2008 Decree Granting Divorce and Awarding Child
 Custody (Decree).
 
I. 
A.
 
This case involves divorce proceedings between
 
Petitioner and Respondent.
5 At issue during the proceedings was
 
the disposition of property located at “Parcel 55, off Papalina
 Road, Kalaheo, Kauai.” (Kalaheo Property) In Petitioner’s
 closing argument, submitted by memorandum, he stated that the
 
2
 The texts of these Rules are set forth infra.
 
3 In his Application for Writ of Certiorari Petitioner seeks review
 
of the February 12, 2013 judgment of the ICA filed pursuant to its January 22,
2013 Summary Disposition Order (SDO), affirming the “Order on Plaintiff’s and
 Defendant’s Motions for Post-Decree Relief” entered by the court on June 4,
 2009.
 
4
 The ICA’s SDO was filed by Presiding Judge Daniel R. Foley, and
 
Associate Judges Alexa D.M. Fujise and Lawrence M. Reifurth.
 
5
 Petitioner and Respondent were married for five years. Their
 
marriage began in July, 2002. They were separated on April 24, 2007.

     ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
parties had come to an agreement regarding the Kalaheo Property:
 
The parties agree that the Kalaheo Property [] will be sold.
The agreed upon appraised value of the Property at the Date
of Marriage is $135,000. As further agreed in Judge’s
Chambers on April 15, 2008, Plaintiff is entitled to one-
half the appreciation of the property after factoring in the
sales price of the Property minus the balance of the loan on
the Property, minus the capital gains tax , minus the costs
of sale (including escrow fees, realtor commissions, taxes)
minus the net value of the property at the Date of Marriage
($135,000 minus loan balance at time of marriage).
Defendant avers that he should also be credited for one-half
 of the debt and one-half of the taxes paid on the Property
from the Date of Separation . . . until the date the
Property is actually sold.
 
(Emphases added). 
Respondent’s closing argument did not contest
 
Petitioner’s characterization of the parties’ agreement regarding
 
the Kalaheo Property. Instead, Respondent stated that “all
 issues for the divorce have been agreed to” except for (1) travel
 time, (2) Christmas vacation, (3) child care expenses, (4)
 custody over one of the children’s bank account, (5) tax
 liability for the parties for 2006 and prior, (6) division of
 personal property, and (7) division of certificates and debts. 
In Respondent’s proposed divorce decree, Respondent
 
included terms for the division of the Kalaheo Property that were 
ultimately adopted in the final divorce decree.
6 Respondent’s
 
6
 The capital gains tax was mentioned in the record for the first
 
time in Respondent’s Exhibit entitled “[Respondent’s] Proposed Divorce
 
Decree,” filed on May 2, 2008. [RA 1 at 105] The proposed divorce decree
stated that before dividing the proceeds of the sale, the proceeds would be
used to, inter alia , “pay all fees, costs, and capital gains tax from the
sales transaction of the Kalaheo Property.” [RA 1 at 157] (Emphasis added.)
Identical language was also included in Petitioner’s Exhibit
 
entitled “[Petitioner’s] Proposed Divorce Decree,” also filed on May 2, 2008.

            ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
attorney prepared the Decree. Those terms were substantially
 
similar to the understanding expressed in Petitioner’s closing
 argument.
 
The court entered the Decree on September 26, 2008. In
 
relevant part, the Decree provided that the Kalaheo Property
 would be sold, and the proceeds divided as proposed by the
 parties:
 
9. Real Property : The [Kalaheo Property] . . . was
acquired by [Petitioner] prior to the parties’ marriage, and
 
is thus [Petitioner’s] separate property.
The parties agree to sell the Kalaheo Property for
$235,000.00 .
The  sale  proceeds  of  the  Kalaheo  Property  shall  be
divided  as  follows:
 
a
. Pay off the loan at Kauai Community Federal Credit Union
[] and/or an real property tax debt for the Kalaheo Property
as of the date of separation ($18,482.87);
b. Pay all fees, costs, and capital gains tax from the sales
transaction at Kalaheo Property , including realtor
commissions, if any;
c. Pay [Petitioner] $96,755.89 ($135,000, the appraised
value of the Kalaheo Property at the time of the marriage,
July 2002 minus $38,244.11, the amount of the debt on the
property at the time of marriage).
d. Pay [Petitioner] one-half of the costs of the Appraisal
of the Kalaheo Property performed by Jose Diogo on August
27, 2007, and paid for in full by [Petitioner].
e. Balance to be divided equally between the parties .
 
(First emphasis in original.) (Remaining emphases added.)
 
B.
 
Both parties filed post-decree motions. On December 8,
 
2008, Respondent filed a Motion for Post Decree Relief. In her
 
6(...continued)
Identical language was again included in a Proposed Divorce Decree
attached as an exhibit to Respondent’s final argument on May 19, 2008. [RA 2
 at 168, 189] The terms regarding the Kalaheo Property set forth in this final
Proposed Decree were identical to those ultimately adopted by the court,
except for the deletion of the phrase “minus ½ of the debt [on the Kauai
Community Federal Credit Union loan for the property] paid between the date of
separation and the date of sale.” [RA 2 at 189, 261]

       ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
motion, Respondent asked the court “for an Order enforcing the 
Decree.” The Motion was filed “pursuant to Rules 4, 7, and 70 of the Hawai' i Family Court Rules [and] HRS § 580-56.” In a 
declaration attached to the Motion, Respondent’s counsel averred that Petitioner had failed to pay Respondent as required by the Decree. In relevant part, Respondent claimed that “[b]ased upon the calculations set forth in the subsections of provision 9 in the Decree, and the $230,000.00 sale price of the Kalaheo lot, [Petitioner] owes [Respondent] $57,146.62.” Respondent’s counsel also maintained that Petitioner had not complied with the terms of the Decree regarding the disposition of personal property. On December 16, 2008, Respondent also filed a Motion for Modification of Child Support. 
On January 23, 2009, Petitioner filed a Motion for
 
Relief From Decree Granting Divorce and Awarding Child Custody. 
7 8
This motion was filed “pursuant to Rules 7  and 60 of the
[HFCR].” In the attached memorandum, Petitioner contended that
 
7 HFCR Rule 7 provides in relevant part as follows:
 
(b) Motions and Other Papers.
 
(1) An application to the court for an order shall be by motion,
. . . shall be made in writing, shall state with particularity the
grounds therefor, and shall set forth the relief or order sought.
 
(5) Any motion seeking an order for or modification of financial
or monetary relief of any kind, . . . shall have attached,
typewritten . . . income and expense and asset and debt statements
on the forms provided by the court or equivalent forms, executed
by the movant and duly notarized or executed under penalty of
perjury . . . .

         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Petitioner and Respondent had agreed to use specific language in
 
paragraphs nine and ten of the Decree. However, Respondent had
 modified or omitted relevant language in the final Decree
 submitted to the court. Regarding paragraph nine, Petitioner
 maintained that Respondent had omitted from section D the
 language “‘pay [Petitioner] the principal paid by him on the loan
 from the date of separation to the date of sale.’”
 
On January 26, 2009, Petitioner filed a Motion in
 
Opposition to Respondent’s Motion for Post-Decree Relief. 
Petitioner argued, inter alia, that if the request in his Motion
 for Relief from Decree for modification of the Decree was
 granted, then the amount he owed Respondent pursuant to paragraph
 nine of the Decree should be reduced. He also argued that,
 pursuant to paragraph nine, he had subtracted the amount paid in
 capital gains tax from the amount he ultimately paid Petitioner. 
A hearing on the above motions was apparently held on
 
January 29, 2009. The record does not contain a transcript of
 the hearing.
 
On May 14, 2009, the court denied Petitioner’s Motion
 
for Relief From Decree Granting Divorce and Awarding Child
 Custody. The court did not issue findings of fact and
 conclusions of law or otherwise explain its denial of the motion.
 
On May 20, 2009, Petitioner’s counsel withdrew as
 
counsel of record. Proceeding pro se, Petitioner filed a motion
 requesting the court to reconsider its order denying Petitioner’s

         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Motion for Relief From Decree Granting Divorce and Awarding Child
 
Custody. 
On June 4, 2009, the court issued its Order on Post
 
Decree Relief. In relevant part, the said Order resulted in
 Respondent paying less than half of the capital gains taxes on
 the income from the sale of the Kalaheo Property. Paragraph
 three stated:
 
3. Plaintiff’s share of the equity in the Kalaheo Property
shall be adjusted to reflect that her share of the capital
gains tax paid as a result of the sale of the property shall
be based on the appreciation in the value of the property
from date of marriage of the parties to the date of sale of
the property and not from the initial date of purchase of
the property.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
On July 20, 2009 the court issued the following
 
relevant Findings of Fact (findings) relating to its Order on
 
Post-Decree Relief:
 
3. Pursuant to the Decree Granting Divorce and Awarding
Child Custody filed herein on September 26, 2008, the
Kalaheo Property was order sold and the proceeds divided
equally between the parties, with [Petitioner] being
credited in the amount of $96,755.89, which amount reflected
the net value of the Kalaheo Property at the date of
marriage
 
4. The Kalaheo Property was subsequently sold;
 
5. As the owner of the Kalaheo Property, [Petitioner] is
required to pay a capital gains tax based upon the
appreciation of said property from date of purchase to date
of sale;
 
6. [Respondent] and [Petitioner] were to share equally in
the appreciation of the Kalaheo Property from the date of
marriage to the date of sale, after the costs of sale,
payment of the existing mortgage on the property and capital
gains tax from the sale were paid;
 
7. Because [Petitioner] is entitled to a credit for the net
value of the Kalaheo Property at the date of marriage and
because the property had appreciated in value from the date
 
7
         
          
        
        
          
         
         
         
          
 
  
            
     
          
        
          
         
       
          
           
        
         
          
         
          
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
of purchase to the date of marriage, it would not be
equitable to require that [Respondent] share equally in the
capital gains tax which taxed the appreciation of the
property from the date of purchase (and not the date of
marriage) to the date of the sale of said property;
 
8. The Decree Granting Divorce and Awarding Child Custody
did not specifically detail how much of the capital gains
tax incurred by the sale of the Kalaheo Property each party
should bear.
 . . .
 
(Emphases added). The court also issued the following
 
Conclusions of Law (conclusions):
   
1. W here an order or decree is ambiguous, it is within the
court’s discretion to clarify the ambiguity;
 
2. That portion of the Decree Granting Divorce and Awarding
Child Custody filed herein on September 26, 2008 which
addressed the division of the proceeds of the sale of the
Kalaheo Property was ambiguous as to each party’s share of
the capital gains tax incurred on said property ;
 
3. Based upon the fact that [Petitioner] was to receive
credit for the net value of the Kalaheo Property on the date
of marriage, then it would be only equitable that
[Petitioner] alone be responsible for the tax on any capital
gains incurred on said property from the date of purchase to
the date of marriage and that both parties be responsible
for the tax on any capital gains incurred on said property
from the date of marriage to the date of sale .
 
(Emphases added.) The court then issued an “Order” which
 
repeated verbatim paragraph three of its June 4, 2009 Order. 
II.
 
A.
 
Petitioner, continuing pro se, appealed to the ICA. 
Petitioner argued, 
inter alia, (1) that contrary to conclusion 2,
 
the Divorce Decree was not ambiguous, (2) Respondent did not file
 a written motion to modify the divorce decree, but instead
 “brought the issue of Plaintiff’s ‘pro rata’ share of the capital
 gains tax in a hearing for another matter on January 29, 2009,”
 
8
         
         
              
           
          
             
              
           
          
            
             
              
 
         
            
          
           
           
           
           
          
            
          ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
and (3) because the issue was raised for the first time at the
 
hearing, Petitioner was unable to prepare and therefore was
 denied due process. Respondent did not file an answering brief.
9
 
B.
 
The ICA declined to address Petitioner’s substantive
 
arguments. Instead, the ICA noted that the transcript of the
 January 29, 2009 hearing was not made a part of the record, and
 without the transcript, the court was “unable to consider the
 merits of [Petitioner’s] contention[s].” 
Thomas-Yukimura v.
 
Yukimura, No. 29927, 2013 WL 238833 at *1. Therefore, the ICA
 “le[ft] undisturbed the [ c]ourt’s decision and order.”
10 Id. 
III.
 
The relevant question presented in Petitioner’s 
9 Respondent’s failure to file an Answering Brief did not require 
the ICA to decide in favor of Petitioner. See Omerod v. Heirs of Kaheananui ,
116 Hawai 'i 239, 268, 172 P.2d 983, 1012 (2007) (“Reversal is not
automatically mandated by the appellee's failure to respond [in the Answering
Brief] to an alleged error argued by the appellant.”); see also Costa v. Sunn ,
5 Haw. App. 419, 430, 697 P.2d 43, 51 (1985) (“[A]ppellee's failure to file ananswering brief does not entitle appellant to the relief sought from theappellate court, even though the court may accept appellant's statement offacts as correct.”). However, this court has said that “when an appelleefails to respond, an appellant is required only to make a prima face showingof error to obtain the relief sought.” Omerod, 116 Hawai 'i at 269, 172 P.3d 
at 1013. 
10
 Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration before the ICA on 
Feburary 1, 2013. Petitioner argued that, (1) the documents provided to theICA were sufficient to demonstrate “that the court procedurally erred inmodifying the Decree to adjust [Respondent’s] share of capital gains tax, (2)Petitioner should be allowed to supplement the record, and (3) Petitioner wasunable to file the hearing transcript because the courts on Kaua 'i only
provide video transcripts, and Petitioner had to contact someone on Maui toobtain a written transcript, which created an “unfair time disadvantage” in submitting the appeal by the deadline. [Motion for Reconsideration at 1-2]On Feburary 11, 2013, the ICA denied Petitioner’s motion for reconsideration.

         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Application is whether the ICA gravely erred in affirming the
 
court’s order modifying the divorce decree.11
 
In his Application, Petitioner reiterates the arguments 
raised in his Opening Brief and Motion for Reconsideration. Construing Petitioner’s arguments liberally, see Dupree v. Higa, 127 Hawai' i 297, 315, 219 P.2d 1084, 1102 (2009) (“Pleadings 
prepared by pro se litigants should be interpreted liberally”), Petitioner contends in his Application (1) that the court did not have the power to amend the final judgment in these circumstances, (2) he was denied due process because he did not have an opportunity to respond to the arguments raised by Respondent at the hearing, and (3) he should be allowed to supplement the record to provide the court with the written transcript of the hearing, if necessary. 
IV.
 
As to Petitioner’s first question, this court in Wong
 
v. Wong, 79 Hawai' i 26, 897 P.2d 953 (1995), addressed the power 
of the trial courts to review their own judgments. 79 Hawai' i at 
29, 897 P.2d at 956. It was explained that “[i]n the absence of rules or terms of court, a court may act to alter its own judgment within ‘proper limitations of time.’” Id. However, 
this court noted that the circuit courts “are now governed by the 
11
 Petitioner also contended that the ICA gravely erred in denying
 
his motion for reconsideration, whereas Petitioner had previously obtained a
DVD transcript of the relevant hearing, and the ICA would not allow Petitioner
to supplement the Record on Appeal with a written transcript.
 
10
         
     
           
          
       
           
           
        
         
          
           
     
 
        
             
           
            
        
          
         
            ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure [(HRCP)],” which “set forth the 
circumstances under and the times within which the circuit courts
 
may take actions to review and set aside their own judgments.” 
This court specifically cited HRCP Rules 50, 52(b), 59, and 60 as
 governing the review of final judgments. 
In the instant case, the family court is governed by
 
the HFCR. 
Analogous to the HRCP in Wong, HFCR 52(b), 59, and 60
 
govern the circumstances under which the family courts may “take
 actions to review and set aside their own judgments.” 79 Hawai' i 
at 29, 897 P.2d at 956. Wong also cited HRCP Rule 50; however,
 
there is no analogous Rule 50 in the HFCR. Therefore, the court
 in this case could not review its final judgment unless its
 
12  13 1 4
 actions conformed with HFCR Rules 52(b), 59, or 60.
 
12 HFCR Rule 52(b) provides as follows:
 
Upon motion of a party made not later than 10 days after
entry of judgment the court may amend its findings or make
additional findings and may amend the judgment accordingly.
The motion may be made with a motion for a new trial
pursuant to Rule 59. When findings of fact are made by the
court, the question of sufficiency of the evidence to
support the findings may thereafter be raised whether or not
the party raising the question has made in the family court
an objection to such findings or has made a motion to amend
them or a motion for judgment.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
13 HFCR Rule 59 provides in relevant part as follows:
 
(a) Grounds. A new trial may be granted to all or any of the
parties and on all or part of the issues for good cause
shown. On a motion for a new trial, the court may open the
judgment if one has been entered, take additional testimony,
amend findings of fact and conclusions of law, or make new
findings and conclusions, and direct the entry of a new
judgment.

14 HRCP Rule 60 provides in relevant part as follows:
 
(a) Clerical mistakes. Clerical mistakes in judgments,
orders or other parts of the record and errors therein
arising from oversight or omission may be corrected by the
court at any time of its own initiative or on the motion of
any party and after such notice, if any, as the court
orders. During the pendency of an appeal, such mistakes may
be so corrected before the appeal is docketed, and
thereafter while the appeal is pending may be so corrected
with leave of the appellate court.
(b) Mistakes; inadvertence; excusable neglect; newly
discovered evidence; fraud. On motion and upon such terms as
are just, the court may relieve a party or a party's legal
representative from any or all of the provisions of a final
judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons:
(1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect ;
(2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could
not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial
 under Rule 59(b); (3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated
intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other
misconduct of an adverse party; (4) the judgment is void;
(5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or
discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has

A.
 
As Petitioner argues, under HFCR Rule 59(e), a motion 
to reconsider, alter, or amend a judgment or order must be filed 
“no later than 10 days after entry of the judgment or order.” HFCR Rule 59(e).
15 HFCR Rule 6(d) further provides that the 
court “may not extend the time for taking any action under . . . Rules 59(b), (d), and (e).” Additionally, it appears that a court may not act sua sponte to extend the 10 day time limit. Cf. Wong, 79 Hawai' i at 31, 897 P.2d at 958 (“Nor could the 
circuit court sua sponte vacate its final judgment to allow untimely service of an HRCP 59 motion, for doing so would allow precisely what is prohibited by HRCP 6(b).”); Escritor v. Maui County Council, Ltd., 2 Haw. App. 200, 202, 629 P.2d 1146, 1148 (1981) (“Rule 6(a) expressly provides that the circuit court has no power to extend the time for taking any action under Rule 59(e).”).

the operation of the judgment . The motion shall be made
within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2), and (3)
not more than one year after the judgment, order, or
proceedings was entered or taken. . . .
 
(Emphases added.)
 
15
 HFCR Rule 59(e) provides an exception for cases governed by HRS §
 
571-11(1), (2), or (6). None of the relevant subsections of HRS § 571-11 are
 at issue in this case. HRS § 571-11(1) addresses alleged crimes committed by
persons under 18 years of age. HRS § 571-11(2) addresses children who are
neglected, fail to attend school, or violate curfew. HRS § 571-11(6)
 addresses judicial consent to the “marriage, employment, or enlistment of a
 child.” In contrast, the instant case involves a divorce decree.
 
13
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
In the instant case, the court entered its Decree on
 
September 26, 2008. No further motions regarding the Decree were
 
filed until December 8, 2008, when Respondent filed her Motion
 for Post-Decree relief. Thus, it is evident that no actions were
 taken to modify the Decree until well after the 10 day time limit
 provided by HFCR Rule 59(e) had passed. Hence, the court could
 not act to modify its judgment under Rule 59(e).
 
For the same reasons, the court could not act to amend
 
its judgment under HFCR Rule 52(b). Rule 52(b) also requires the
 party to file a motion within 10 days, and HFCR Rule 6(d) also
 precludes the court from extending the time to file a Rule 52(b)
 motion. Therefore, HFCR Rule 52(b) was also inapplicable.
 
B.
 1.
 
However, as explained by Wong, Rule 60 also grants the
 
court power to modify a final judgment. To reiterate, HFCR Rule
 60(a) provides that “[c]lerical mistakes in judgments, orders, or
 other parts of the record and errors therein arising from
 oversight or omission may be corrected by the court at any time
 o[n] its own initiative or on the motion of any party and after
 such notice, if any, as the court orders.” (Emphasis added.) In
 the instant case, the court may have relied on Rule 60(a) to
 amend the judgment. Conclusion one stated that “where an order
 of the court is ambiguous, it is within the court’s discretion to 
14
         
          
         
           
             
           
            
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
correct the ambiguity.” In other words, the court’s conclusion
 
suggested that the court was simply “correcting” a mistake in the
 original judgment.
 
However, Rule 60(a) was not available to the court in 
the instant case. Relief is not appropriate under Rule 60(a) “when the change is substantive in nature.” Wright and Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2854.
16 “[A] motion under Rule 
60(a) . . . cannot be used to make [the judgment or order] say something other than what was originally pronounced.” Id. 
(emphasis added); see also Davis v. Wholesale Motors, 86 Hawai' i 
405, 416, 949 P.2d 1026, 1037 (App. 1997) (allowing modification of a judgment under HRCP Rule 60 because “the amended judgment did not make any substantive changes to the original judgment.”). Consequently, “Rule 60(a) is not a vehicle for relitigating matters that already have been litigated and decided, nor to change what has been deliberately done.” Id. (emphasis added); 
see also Donnelly v. Donnelly, 98 Hawai' i 280, 286, 47 P.3d 747, 
753 (App. 2002) (“HFCR Rule 60(a) applies ‘to situations in which a judgment clearly misrepresents what the court meant to 
16
 Rule 60 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) is 
essentially identical to HFCR Rule 60. Therefore, authorities interpreting 
the Federal Rules are “highly persuasive.” Kawamata Farms, Inc. v. United 
Agri Products , 86 Hawai 'i 214, 252, 948 P,2d 1055, 1093 (1997) (“Where we have
patterned a rule of procedure after an equivalent rule within the FRCP,interpretations of the rule by the federal courts are deemed to be highlypersuasive in the reasoning of this court.”) (internal quotation marksomitted). 
15
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
state.’”) (quoting 2 James Wm. Moore, Moore’s Federal Practice §
 
60.11[1][c] (3d ed.)). 
In the instant case, the court’s amendment of the final
 
judgment was “substantive in nature.” First, contrary to
 conclusion two, the original divorce decree was not “ambiguous as
 to each parties’ share of the capital gains tax.” [See RA 3 at
 138] Instead, the Decree provided that the parties would pay any
 capital gains tax equally. To reiterate, the Decree stated that
 the proceeds of the sale of the Kalaheo Property would be used to
 (1) pay a loan at Kauai Community, (2) pay all of the fees,
 costs, and capital gains tax from the sales transaction of the
 Kalaheo Property, (3) pay Petitioner the appraised value of the
 property at the time of marriage, and (4) pay one-half of the
 costs of the appraisal of the property. The balance of the
 proceeds was to be divided between the parties. [RA 2 at 261] 
Balance is defined as, inter alia, the “remainder” or
 
“an amount in excess, especially on the credit side of an
 account.” Merriam Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary at 87 (10th
 ed. 1993). By providing that the “remainder” of the proceeds
 would be divided by the parties, the Decree plainly indicated
 that the first four requirements were to be satisfied before the
 proceeds of the sale were divided. This included, inter alia,
 paying all of the capital gains tax from selling the property. 
16
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
The original decree unambiguously provided that the proceeds of
 
the sale would be used to pay the capital gains tax before the
 proceeds were divided by the parties. In other words, the
 parties would be equally responsible for paying the capital gains
 tax, because that tax would have to be paid before the proceeds
 were divided equally.
 
The court’s Order on Post-Decree Relief, however,
 
reduced Respondent’s liability for the capital gains tax. That
 Order provided that Respondent’s “share of the equity in the
 Kalaheo Property shall be adjusted to reflect that her share of
 the capital gains tax paid as a result of the sale of the
 property shall be based on the appreciation in the value of the
 property from the date of marriage . . . .” [RA 2 at 101] The
 appreciation value of the property from the date of marriage was
 less than the total proceeds of the sale. [See id. at 261] 
Therefore, requiring the capital gains tax to be based only on
 the appreciation of the property from the date of marriage meant
 that Respondent’s share of the capital gains tax would be less
 than one-half of the total. The Order effectively absolved
 Respondent of the requirement in the Decree that she pay one-half
 of the capital gains tax. Hence, the effect of the Order was to
 make the judgment “say something other than was originally
 pronounced.” Wright and Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure §
 2854. 
17
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Second, the effect of the court’s Order was to “change
 
something that was deliberately done.” Id. The record
 
demonstrates that the parties agreed that the proceeds of the
 
sale of the Kalaheo Property to pay all of the capital gains
 taxes arising from the sale before distributing the proceeds of
 the sale to the parties. Petitioner’s closing statement asserted
 that “as agreed in Judge’s Chambers,” Respondent was to receive
 “one-half the appreciation of the property” but that appreciation
 was to be calculated by “factoring in the sales price of the
 property” minus, inter alia, “the capital gains tax.” [RA 2 at
 158] 
This agreement was also reflected in the proposed
 
decree drafted by Respondent, which stated that the proceeds of
 the sale of the Kalaheo Property would be used to pay all of the
 capital gains tax before the proceeds were divided by the
 parties. [Id. at 198] The reason that the Decree required that
 the parties pay the capital gains tax equally, therefore, was
 that this reflected the agreement of the parties on that issue. 
Hence, this requirement was “deliberate.” It was inappropriate
 then to use HFCR Rule 60(a) to change this “deliberate”
 understanding. Wright and Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure
 § 2854. Consequently, the court’s action amending the judgment
 cannot be justified by HFCR Rule 60(a).
 
2.
 
Finally, the court’s findings and conclusions
 
18
         
           
         
          
      
      
        
           
      
       
         
        
         
         
       
        
 
          
              
          
            
           
              
             
          
            
             
             
           
           
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
demonstrate that the court’s order cannot be justified by Rule
 
60(b). HFCR Rule 60(b) provides that:
 
On motion17 and upon such terms as are just, the court may
relieve a party or a party’s legal representative from any
or all of the provisions of a final judgment , order, or
proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly
discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have
been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule
 59(b); (3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic
or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an
adverse party; (4) the judgment is void; (5) the judgment
has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior
judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or
otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the
judgment should have prospective application; or (6) any
other reason justifying relief from the operation of the
judgment.
 
(Emphasis added.) The court’s conclusions stated that the
 
judgment was “ambiguous” and that the court could “clarify the
 ambiguity.” [RA 3 at 139] Ambiguity, however, is not one of the
 bases for granting a party relief from a final judgment under
 Rule 60(b). As discussed 
supra, it is plain that the “ambiguity”
 
did not constitute a “mistake” because the parties agreed that
 they would pay the capital gains tax equally. Further, Rule
 60(b)(6) allows the court to grant a Rule 60(b) motion for “any 
17 Although the plain language of Rule 60(b) would appear to require
 
a motion by the parties to allow the court to act, the majority of courts
apparently allow the court to reconsider decisions under Rule 60(b) sua
sponte. See, e.g. , Kingvision Pay-Per View Ltd. v. Lake Alice Bar , 168 F.3d
347, 352 (9th Cir. 1999) (Noting that “[t]he traditional definition of sua
 
sponte is that the court acts of ‘its own will or motion ,’ and therefore “the
 
words “on motion” in Rule 60(b) do not plainly exclude sua sponte repairs of
mistakes or inadvertence”) (quoting Blacks Law Dictionary 1424 (6th ed. 1990)
(emphasis in original)); Fort Knox Music Inc. v. Baptiste , 257 F.3d 108 (2d
Cir 2001); cf. Wright and Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2865. But
 
see, e.g. , Eaton v. Jamrog , 984 F.2d 760, 762 (6th Cir. 1993) (holding that
court did not have authority to vacate judgment under Rule 60(b) because,
inter alia , “Rule 60(b) explicitly requires a motion from the affected party,
and in this case the district court acted sua sponte .”).
 
19
         
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
other reason justifying relief.” HFCR Rule 60(b)(6). However,
 
HFCR Rule 60(b)(6) “provides for extraordinary relief and is only
 invoked upon a showing of exceptional circumstances.” Isemoto
 
Contracting Co. v. Andrade, 1 Haw. App. 202, 205, 616 P.2d 1022,
 1025 (1980). The court’s findings and conclusions do not address
 “exceptional circumstances.” Nothing in the court’s findings or
 conclusions suggest that the requirements of Rule 60(b) have been
 met. Hence, the court’s Order cannot be justified by Rule 60(b).
 
Moreover, reliance on Rule 60(b) is precluded by Nakata
 
v. Nakata, 3 Haw. App. 51, 641 P.2d 333 (1982). In Nakata,
 during divorce proceedings, the parties prepared an “Agreement”
 which provided, inter alia, that the plaintiff would be granted
 possession of specific real property, but would be required to
 pay 25% of the equity in the property to the defendant within six
 months. Id. at 52, 641 P.2d at 334. If the plaintiff could not
 
pay 25% within six months, the property was to be sold. Id. At
 
the request of both parties, the family court incorporated the
 Agreement into the decree of divorce. Id. at 56, 641 P.3d at
 
336. 
In the six months following the entry of the decree of
 
divorce, the plaintiff failed to pay 25% of the value of the
 property. Id. at 53, 641 P.2d at 335. The defendant filed an
 
order to show cause requesting that the property be sold. Id. 
20
         
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
The court allowed the plaintiff an additional three months to
 
exercise her right to purchase. Id. This was done because “the
 
parties both anticipated and recognized in the Agreement” that
 the plaintiff’s ability to pay defendant 25% of the equity in the
 property was contingent upon the sale of property on Molokai, and
 that the failure to sell the property on Molokai was not within
 the plaintiff’s control. Id. at 54, 641 P.2d at 335.
 
The defendant appealed, arguing that the family court 
“amended the clear, unambiguous, and enforceable language of its [decree of divorce].” Id. at 54-55, 641 P.2d at 335. The 
plaintiff responded that the court “did not modify the decree,” but “merely clarified ambiguities.” Id. at 54, 641 P.2d at 335. 
The ICA held that “[t]he authority for the [family] court’s action comes, if at all, from [HFCR] Rule 60(b).” Id. at 55, 641 
P.2d at 336. However, “the broad power granted by [HFCR] Rule 60(b) [] is not for the purpose of relieving a party from free, calculated, and deliberate choices he, she, or it has made.” Id. at 56, 641 P.2d at 336 (citing Wright and Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2864 (1st ed. 1973)); accord In Re RGB, 123 Hawai' i 1, 20, 229 P.3d 1066, 1085 (2010). Because the 
Agreement was incorporated into the decree at the request of both parties, the ICA held that the use of HFCR Rule 60(b) “was excessive.” Nakata, 3 Haw. App. at 56, 641 P.2d at 336. 
21
         
          
            
           
               
       ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Similarly, as discussed supra, the Decree’s equal
 
apportionment of the capital gains tax was the result of the
 
agreement of the parties. Inasmuch as Rule 60(b) cannot be used
 for the “purpose of relieving a party from [a] free, calculated,
 and deliberate choice[] he, she, or it has made,” id., the court
 could not have amended the Decree under Rule 60(b).
 
C.
 
Petitioner argues that Respondent’s failure to file an 
HFCR 59(e) motion within 10 days rendered the court powerless to amend the Decree to reduce the amount of capital gains tax paid by Respondent. To amend the decree, the court must have acted under one of HFCR Rule 52(b), HFCR Rule 59, or HFCR Rule 60. Wong, 79 Hawai' i at 29, 897 P.2d at 956. Based on the foregoing, 
the court’s Order amending the Decree did not meet the requirements of any of these Rules. Hence, the court lacked the power to amend the Decree. The court’s Order must therefore be vacated.
18 
VII.
 
Based on the foregoing, we vacate the ICA’s February
 
12, 2013 judgment and the court’s June 4, 2009 Order on Post­
18
 As noted, Petitioner also argued in the second question of his
 
Application that he was deprived of due process because the court amended the
Decree without allowing him to respond. However, as discussed supra, the
court did not have the authority to amend the decree at all under the HFCR.
Therefore, it is unnecessary to address this argument.

19 As noted, Petitioner maintained in the third question of his
 
Application that if it was necessary to demonstrate that the court erred, he
should have been allowed to supplement the record with the hearing transcript.
However, as shown supra, it is possible to determine that the court erred
without recourse to the transcript.
“The law is clear in this jurisdiction that the appellant has the
burden of furnishing the appellate court with a sufficient record topositively show the alleged error.” Bettencourt v. Bettencourt , 80 Hawai 'i 
225, 230-31, 909 P.2d 553, 558-59 (1995) (citation omitted). “When an appellant desires to raise any point on appeal that requires consideration ofthe oral proceedings before the court,” the appellant also must request transcripts of those proceedings. HRAP Rule 10(a)(b)(1)(A); Bettencourt , 80 
Hawai'i at 230-31, 909 P.2d at 558-59. However, in the instant case, the
record clearly discloses that the court did not have the authority under theHFCR to amend or modify the Decree, Wong, 79 Hawai 'i at 29, 897 P.2d at 956,
therefore, a transcript of the January 29, 2009 hearing was not necessary, see
