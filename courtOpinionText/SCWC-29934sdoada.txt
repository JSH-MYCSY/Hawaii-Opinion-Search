 ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
On certiorari, Akitake presents the following questions: 
A. Whether the ICA gravely erred in holding that the
district court did not err as a matter of law in ruling that
it had jurisdiction notwithstanding that State v. Wheeler
held that the district court had no jurisdiction as to a
charge that failed to allege “the pu[b]lic road” element[.]
B. Whether the ICA gravely erred in holding that the
district court did not abuse its discretion in continuing
Akitake’s trial to a fourth trial day?
 
As to Akitake’s second question presented, we find no error in
 
the ICA’s conclusion that the district court did not abuse its
 discretion in granting the State’s motion to continue the trial
 for a fourth day because it had already determined that trial
 
would not be completed on the third day.
    
As to Akitake’s first question presented, however, we
 
conclude that the charge failed to allege the attendant
 
circumstance that the defendant operated his vehicle on a public
 roadway. See State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai' i 383, 392, 219 P.3d 
1170, 1179 (2009). As the charge lacked an allegation of an
 attendant circumstance, which is an element of the offense of
 OVUII, it failed to state the offense of OVUII. Cf. State v.
 
period; 
(C) Any one or more of the following:
(i) Seventy-two hours of community service work;
(ii) Not less than forty-eight hours and not more than five
days of imprisonment; or
(iii) A fine of not less than $150 but not more than $1,000;
(D) A surcharge of $25 to be deposited into the neurotrauma
special fund; and
(E) May be charged a surcharge of up to $50 to be deposited
into the trauma system special fund if the court so
orders[.]

Apollonio, 130 Hawai' i 353, 358, 311 P.3d 676, 681 (2013) 
(dismissing without prejudice excessive speeding complaint, the 
deficiency of which was raised for the first time on appeal, because complaint failed to allege mens rea, and could therefore not be construed to state the offense of excessive speeding). 
Akitake’s OVUII charge was deficient. 
Consequently, we
 
vacate the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal and remand this case to
 the district court with instructions to dismiss Akitake’s
 
Complaint without prejudice. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, January 10, 2014.
