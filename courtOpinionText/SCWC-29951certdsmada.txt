IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
JASON KELLY ANDREWS, Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant,
 
vs.
 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent/Plaintiff-Appellee.
 
CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
(ICA NO. 29951; S.P.P. NO. 08-1-004K; CR. NO.03-1-279K)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI
  
(by: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant Jason Kelly Andrews’s 
application for writ of certiorari, which was electronically 
filed by the clerk’s office on August 27, 2012, was filed more than sixty days after the filing of the ICA’s June 25, 2012, judgment on appeal. The application is untimely and thus, this court lacks appellate jurisdiction. See Hawai
'i Revised Statutes 
§ 602-59(c) (Supp. 2011); Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
Rule 40.1(a). Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the application for writ of
 
certiorari is dismissed.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, September 6, 2012.
