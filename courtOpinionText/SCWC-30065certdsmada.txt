WILLARD M. IMAMOTO, Petitioner/Plaintiff-Appellant,
 
vs.
 
KAHI MOHALA HOSPITAL, NAOMI MORGAN, DUDLEY AKAMA, THE DEPARTMENT
OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, Respondents/Defendants-Appellees.
 
CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
(ICA NO. 30065; CIV. NO. 06-1-2068)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant Willard M. Imamoto’s
 
application for writ of certiorari, which was filed on July 8,
 
2013, was filed more than thirty days after the filing of the
 ICA’s May 31, 2013 judgment on appeal. The application is
 untimely, and thus this court lacks appellate jurisdiction. See
 
Hawai'i Revised Statutes § 602-59(c) (Supp. 2011); Hawai' i Rules 
of Appellate Procedure Rule 40.1(a) (2013). Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the application for writ of
 
certiorari is dismissed.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, July 15, 2013. 
Willard M. Imamoto,
Petitioner, pro se
 /s/ Mark E. Recktenwald
/s/ Paula A. Nakayama
 /s/ Simeon R. Acoba, Jr.
