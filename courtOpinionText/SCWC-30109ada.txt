OPINION OF THE COURT BY POLLACK, J.
  
Over the last fifteen years, states have struggled to 
address internet solicitation of minors because traditional 
attempt and solicitation statutes do not sufficiently address

internet activity.1 In response, “state legislatures have 
revised their criminal statutes to create a new species of crime 
called ‘Internet luring,’ or ‘enticement.’”2 In 2002, Hawai ʻi 
enacted Hawai ʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-756, electronic 
enticement of a child in the first degree, to deter crimes 
against minors by prohibiting the use of an electronic device to “lure a minor to a meeting with intent to commit a felony.” H. 
Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 417, in 2002 House Journal, at 1399. 
The appeal in this case challenges the 
constitutionality of HRS § 707-756 on overbreadth, vagueness, 
and dormant commerce clause grounds. In resolving the constitutional challenges, we also determine the scope of the conduct prohibited by the electronic enticement statute.

I. Background 
A. Facts3 
Honolulu Police Department (HPD) Detective Andrew 
Brito created an online persona of a 14-year-old girl, Heather 
Cabico, with the screen name “kaplma_girl.” On August 29, 2008, a user with the screen name “eel_nana” started a chat with “kaplma_girl,” in which it was represented that “kaplma_girl” was a fourteen-year-old girl. It was later confirmed that “eel_nana” was the screen name of Rangie B. Alangcas, a male adult. In subsequent online chats, Alangcas expressed his 
interest in meeting Heather Cabico for the purpose of having 
sex. Although Alangcas was informed that Heather Cabico was fourteen-years-old, he still indicated that he would meet her “for having sex” even if she was “not experienced.” 
Alangcas traveled to a decoy meeting at a coffee shop 
at an agreed upon time on September 3, 2008. Alangcas was surveilled at the coffee shop by HPD officers, and he later confirmed in an online chat that it was he who showed up at the 
decoy meeting. 
On March 3, 2009, Alangcas again related his desire to 
engage in sexual conduct with Heather Cabico, and a meeting was

A” to Rangie Alangcas’ second motion to dismiss. The parties have accepted
the police report as an accurate recitation of the events throughout the
litigation.

set up for that day. In an online message, Alangcas indicated 
that he would meet Heather Cabico and her fourteen-year-old 
friend, “Shanna,” at a Pearl City fast-food restaurant before all going to Shanna’s house. Alangcas expressed that he would engage in various sexual acts with Heather, including sexual intercourse. 
HPD officers watched Alangcas leave his house and 
travel to the fast-food restaurant, and Alangcas was arrested outside of the restaurant shortly after his arrival. Alangcas 
subsequently admitted that he went to the restaurant on March 3, 
2009, with the intent to engage in sexual conduct with the two girls. Alangcas also admitted to sending pornographic web site information and a full-face picture of himself to the girls. 
B. Procedural Background 
1. Trial Court Proceedings 
Alangcas was indicted in counts I and III upon the 
charge of electronic enticement of a child in the first degree, in violation of HRS § 707-756,
4 and in counts II and IV upon the 
4 HRS § 707-756 (Supp. 2008) states, 
(1) Any person who, using a computer or any other
electronic device: 
(a) Intentionally or knowingly communicates: 
(i) 	With a minor known by the person to be
under the age of eighteen years; 
(continued. . .)

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
charge of attempted promotion of child pornography for minors, 
in violation of HRS § 705-500(1)(a) and HRS § 712-1215(1)(b)(i).5 
Alangcas filed two motions to dismiss Counts I and III of the 
indictment (collectively, “motions to dismiss”). The first motion argued that HRS § 707-756 violates the dormant commerce clause (first motion to dismiss), and the second motion argued that the statute is unconstitutionally overbroad and vague (second motion to dismiss).

(ii) 	With another person, in reckless disregard
of the risk that the other person is under
the age of eighteen years, and the other
person is under the age of eighteen years;or 
(iii) 	With another person who represents that
person to be under the age of eighteen
years; 
(b) 	With the intent to promote or facilitate the
commission of a felony: 
(i) 	That is a murder in the first or second degree; 
(ii) 	That is a class A felony; or 
(iii) 	That is another covered offense as defined 
in section 846E-1,

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
On September 2, 2009, a hearing was held on Alangcas’ 
motions to dismiss.6 The court orally agreed with the State’s 
opposing position and denied the motions to dismiss. The 
circuit court filed orders denying both motions on September 17, 2009.
7 The court granted Alangcas’ motion for leave to file an 
interlocutory appeal, and the appeal was filed on October 12, 2009. 
2. Proceedings before the ICA 
a. Arguments of the Parties 
On appeal to the ICA, Alangcas argued that the circuit 
court erred in denying his motions to dismiss because HRS § 707-756 is unconstitutional as it is (i) overbroad, (ii) vague, and (iii) burdens interstate commerce. 
i. 
In support of his contention that HRS § 707-756 is 
unconstitutionally overbroad because it criminalizes lawful conduct, Alangcas first evaluated the actus reus of HRS § 707-756. He argued that the actus reus is overbroad because it 
sweeps in lawful conduct, such as making innocent plans to meet a person under the age of eighteen. Next, Alangcas evaluated the mens rea of HRS § 707-756 and asserted that the criminal

7 The orders did not include findings and conclusions. 
- 6 -
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
mens rea, “the intent to promote or facilitate the commission of 
a felony,” only applies to one of the statute’s three elements. 
Thus, he submitted that the mens rea “scheme” is overbroad as it does not narrow the offense sufficiently to exclude lawful conduct. 
Alangcas maintained that the “purpose of the overbroad 
mens rea and actus rea” was to create a de facto attempt statute. He contended that HRS § 707-756 “is so overbroad that it can be committed solely in the mind without any criminal acts 
or outward manifestations of criminal intent.” 
In response, the State contended that HRS § 707-756 is 
not overbroad and only applies to criminal behavior. The State 
argued that Alangcas’ analysis improperly considered the actus reus elements separately from the mens rea, and the State maintained that “a person who merely contacts a minor, agrees to meet the minor, and travels to the agreed upon meeting place cannot be prosecuted under the electronic enticement statute, 
unless the act is performed with the additional scienter—that 
is, to promote or facilitate a certain felony.” 
The State noted that HRS § 707-756 sets forth three 
distinct mens rea requirements to correspond with each element of the offense and only the second element requires the intent to promote or facilitate the commission of a felony. The State maintained that while all three mens rea requirements must be

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
met for criminal liability to attach, only criminal behavior is 
proscribed by HRS § 707-756 “because the statute requires all 
three paragraphs to be read together.”8 
The State disagreed with Alangcas’ argument that HRS § 
707-756 is a de facto attempt statute and asserted that the purpose of the statute was to criminalize predatory computer behavior rather than circumvent the attempt statute. The State maintained that in criminalizing predatory computer behavior, the statute “requires overt acts including electronic 
communication and traveling to an agreed meeting place” and 
cannot be committed solely by thoughts as Alangcas suggests.
9 
ii. 
Alangcas’ also contended that HRS § 707-756 is void 
for vagueness because its referral to HRS § 846E-1 makes it 
unconstitutionally confusing. He pointed to the fact that 
“covered offenses” under HRS § 846E-1 include a criminal offense that is comparable or exceeds other defined offenses (Catch-all 
8 Alangcas pointed out that the State’s position on appeal, that
the criminal mens rea of the second element should apply to all three
elements, was inconsistent with the State’s position in the circuit court.
Alangcas noted that the trial deputy argued that the criminal intent onlyapplied to the second element. 
9 Alangcas maintained that irrespective of the legislative intent
to criminalize predatory criminal behavior, the statute was overbroad and
vague because “there is no actus reus of luring in § 707-756.”

Clauses).10 Alangcas surmised that persons of reasonable 
intelligence could differ on what crimes are comparable or 
exceed others and that such subjectivity creates an unconstitutional danger of discriminatory enforcement. 
Alangcas 
also suggested that HRS § 707-756 is vague because it includes “undefined offenses and possibly offenses in other federal, military and state jurisdictions” (the Conviction Clauses).
11   
10 The “Catch-all Clauses” refer to provisions within HRS § 846E-1
definitions of “Crimes against minors” section 4 and “Sexual offenses”
section 6, which read: 
“Crime against minors” excludes “sexual offenses” as
defined in this section and means a criminal offense that consists of: 
. . . . 
(4) A criminal offense that is comparable to or which
exceeds one of the offenses designated in paragraphs
(1) through (3); . . . 
. . . . 
“Sexual offense” means an offense that is: 

. . . . 

(6) A criminal offense that is comparable to or that
exceeds a sexual offense as defined in paragraphs (1)through (5) . . . . 
HRS § 846E-1 (Supp. 2009). 
11 The “Conviction Clauses” refer to provisions within HRS § 846E-1
definitions of “Crimes against minors” section 5 and “Sexual offenses”section 7, which read: 
“Crime against minors” excludes “sexual offenses” asdefined in this section and means a criminal offense that 
consists of: 
. . . . 
(5) Any federal, military, out-of-state, tribal, or foreign
conviction for any offense that, under the laws of thisState, would be a crime against minors as designated in
paragraphs (1) through (4). 
(continued. . .)

                                                                               ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Lastly, Alangcas argued that “the key action word, 
‘communicates’ is left undefined” and that “[t]his vagueness 
invites delegation of basic policy matters to policemen . . . for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis.” 
The State responded that HRS § 707-756 is clear in its 
criminal prohibitions because it unambiguously defines the covered offenses of “crimes against minors” and “sexual offenses.” The State argued that the Conviction Clauses are not vague or overbroad because they clearly refer to crimes that 
would be the equivalent of those listed in other jurisdictions. 
In response to Alangcas’ argument that HRS § 707-756 subjects citizens to arbitrary police enforcement, the State maintained that the statute “clearly proscribes only conduct that is intended to harm minors.” 
iii. 
Alangcas contended in his third argument on appeal 
that HRS § 707-756 violates the “dormant commerce clause” 
because it regulates conduct wholly outside of Hawai ʻi, places a

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
burden on interstate commerce that outweighs the benefits the 
state received, and creates an inconsistent patchwork of 
regulations that has a chilling effect on interstate commerce over the internet. Alangcas asserted that “state attempts to regulate the flow of information over the internet will almost always be invalid.” 
In its response, the State countered that under its 
police power it may regulate internet conduct intended to endanger children’s welfare. The State reasoned that HRS § 707-
756 does not burden interstate commerce because it only applies 
if the conduct or the result of the offense occurs within the 
State of Hawai ʻi. The State maintained that the statute does not 
contribute to a patchwork of inconsistent regulations and that 
any burden imposed on interstate commerce is far outweighed by the State’s interest in protecting children. 
b. ICA Opinion 
On November 29, 2013, the ICA issued its published 
opinion. State v. Alangcas , 131 Hawai ʻi 312, 318 P.3d 602 (App. 
2013). In determining whether a statute is overbroad, the ICA 
concluded it must “consider whether it reaches a substantial 
amount of constitutionally-protected conduct.” Id. at 316, 318 
P.3d at 606. 
The ICA considered Alangcas’ argument that HRS § 707
-
756 could be violated by a person who innocently uses an 
- 11 -
 
 
                                                 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
electronic device to communicate with a person under eighteen, 
agrees to meet that person, and travels to the agreed meeting 
place at the agreed time, all without a criminal intent. The ICA held that this argument “ignores the language in subsection (b) of the statute that requires that these otherwise ‘innocent’ acts be done with the intent to promote or facilitate the commission of certain, specified, felonies.”
12 Id. at 317, 318 
P.3d at 607. Thus, the ICA concluded that “[w]hen the statute is read as a whole, it is clear that only criminal conduct is 
proscribed.” Id. 
In response to Alangcas’ argument that HRS § 707-756 
is overbroad because it requires criminal intent for only the 
second element, the ICA noted that “because the statute requires all three paragraphs of the statute to be read together, only behavior done with the requisite criminal intent is proscribed, 
12 In this passage and others in its opinion, the ICA appears to
interpret the felonious intent set forth in subsection (b) of the statute to
apply to all of the conduct elements. See also id. at 318, 318 P.3d at 608
(“[T]he statute plainly criminalizes conduct . . . that is coupled with theintent to promote or facilitate the commission of a felony.”). 
Yet, the ICA Opinion also seems to suggest a contrary interpretation—
that the felonious intent of HRS § 707-756 only applies to the agreementelement and not to the communication and traveling elements. 
The ICA Opinion
states that the offense “sufficiently identifies the mens rea for each of theacts which together constitute the criminal offense.” 
Id. at 317, 318 P.3d
at 607; see also id.  at 326, 318 P.3d 616 (“A plain reading of the statute
makes clear that HRS § 707–756 only attaches culpability when a defendantintentionally or knowingly communicates with a minor, agrees to meet theminor with the intent to promote or facilitate a felony, and thenintentionally or knowingly travels to the agreed upon place at the agreed
upon time.”).

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
i.e., conduct that occurs with the intent to promote or 
facilitate the commission of a felony.”13 Id. The ICA concluded 
that “[s]uch a prohibition does not broadly sweep in innocent 
electronic communications with minors.” Id. 
The ICA next addressed Alangcas’ vagueness challenge. 
Id. at 320, 318 P.3d at 610. The ICA held that the reference in HRS § 846E-1 to convictions in other jurisdictions was “merely redundant” and the “criminal prohibition is clear.” Id. at 321, 318 P.3d at 611. The ICA determined that the reference in HRS 
§ 846E-1 to “comparable” offences was not vague because a 
“person of ordinary intelligence can easily understand that a comparable offense is an equivalent one.” Id. However, the ICA 
found that the word “exceeds,” as used in the Catch-all Clauses of HRS § 846E-1, was unconstitutionally vague because the statute and its legislative history provided no guidance for determining whether an offense exceeded the enumerated ones. Id. at 325, 318 P.3d at 615. 
Nonetheless, the ICA concluded that the statute was 
not unconstitutional as applied to Alangcas because “before a law may be held to be unduly vague, in violation of due process, it must be demonstrated that the law is impermissibly vague in all its applications.” Id. The ICA held that Alangcas engaged 
13 See supra note 12. 
- 13 -
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
in conduct that was clearly proscribed by the statute and that 
he could not “complain of the vagueness of the law as applied to 
the conduct of others.” Id. 
In response to Alangcas’ argument that the word 
“communicates” in the statute is undefined and fails to distinguish between “conduct that is calculated to harm and that which is essentially innocent,” the ICA held that “when read in conjunction with the rest of the statute, the meaning [of ‘communicates’] gains even greater clarity” and provides “much 
less leeway” to police in their enforcement of the statute and 
gave the “general public . . . a much better understanding of just what conduct is prohibited.” Id. at 326, 318 P.3d at 616. 
The ICA concluded that HRS § 707-756 “is not 
unconstitutionally overbroad and/or vague as applied to Alangcas, and the Circuit Court did not err in denying Alangcas’ motion to dismiss the indictment on that basis.” Id. 
Lastly, the ICA rejected Alangcas’ argument that HRS § 
707-756 violated the dormant commerce clause, concluding that it “does not concern interstate commerce, and, therefore, scrutiny under the Commerce Clause is not appropriate.” 
Id. at 328, 318 
P.3d at 618. 
On January 14, 2014, the ICA issued its judgment on 
appeal affirming the circuit court’s orders. 
- 14 -

 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
C. Application for Writ of Certiorari 
In his Application for Writ of Certiorari 
(Application), Alangcas presents two questions: 
1. Whether the ICA gravely erred in only using an “as
applied” analysis and holding that HRS § 707-756 is not
unconstitutionally overbroad and/or vague and that theCircuit Court did not err in denying Mr. Alangcas’ motion
to dismiss the indictment on that basis. 
2. Whether the ICA gravely erred in holding that HRS §
707-756 does not violate the dormant Commerce Clause of the 
United States Constitution and that the Circuit Court properly denied Mr. Alangcas’ motion to dismiss the
indictment on that ground. 
Alangcas argues that the ICA applied the “wrong 
vagueness and overbreadth analysis” because the ICA used an “as 
applied” analysis instead of the “more stringent ‘facial’ 
analysis.” Alangcas contends that HRS § 707-756 “does not limit its affect to words that are inherently criminal in nature or that in and of themselves constitute the crime.” On the issue of overbreadth, Alangcas argues that since “the First Amendment is involved” in this case, he only has to show that HRS § 707-756 “is broad enough in its terms to suppress protected speech, without the need of showing that the specific conduct before the 
court is protected.” Alangcas also maintains that the ICA’s 
dormant commerce clause analysis was based on its erroneous application of an “as-applied” standard. 
In its response, the State contends that the 
overbreadth doctrine does not apply because HRS § 707-756 “only regulates communication that is integral to a course of criminal 
- 15 -
 
 
                                                 
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
conduct[] and such speech receives no First Amendment (or 
overbreadth) protection.”14 The State argues that even if the 
speech involved in HRS § 707-756 were protected, the statute 
would still survive a facial challenge. 
Concerning vagueness, the State maintains that “it is 
irrelevant whether the statute could be vague in other circumstances or as to others not before the court” because it is not vague as applied to Alangcas. The State also asserts that the ICA correctly determined the dormant commerce clause 
challenge. 
II. Standards of Review 
When confronted with a constitutional challenge of a 
penal statute on the grounds of vagueness or overbreadth, the 
following principles apply: 
The constitutionality of a statute is a question of law
which is reviewable under the right/wrong standard.
Additionally, where it is alleged that the legislature hasacted unconstitutionally, this court has consistently heldthat every enactment of the legislature is presumptivelyconstitutional, and a party challenging the statute has the
burden of showing unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable
doubt. The infraction should be plain, clear, manifest, andunmistakable. 
State v. Gaylord,  78 Hawai ʻi 127, 137, 890 P.2d 1167, 1177 
(1995). 
14 The State agrees with Alangcas that the “most natural reading of
the statute, based on its plain language and structure, is that the felonious
intent only applies to the agreement element.” 
- 16 -
 
 
Id. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Where possible, a penal statute will be read in such a 
manner as to preserve its constitutionality. 
To accord a constitutional interpretation of a provision of
broad or apparent unrestricted scope, courts will strive to
focus the scope of the provision to a narrow and morerestricted construction. 
Provisions of a penal statute will be accorded a limited
and reasonable interpretation under this doctrine in order
to preserve its overall purpose and to avoid absurd
results. 
Id. at 138, 890 P.2d at 1178 (quoting State v. Taylor, 49 Haw. 
624, 634, 425 P.2d 1014, 1021 (1967)). “[A] statute will not be 
held unconstitutional by reason of uncertainty if any sensible construction embracing the legislative purpose may be given it.” 
Id. 
III.
 Discussion 
“In a facial challenge to the overbreadth and 
vagueness of a law, a court’s first task is to determine whether the enactment reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally 
protected conduct.” State v. Beltran, 116 Hawai ʻi 146, 152, 172 
P.3d 458, 464 (2007) (quoting 
Vill. of Hoffman Estates v. 
Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 494 (1982)). “If 
it does not, then the overbreadth challenge must fail.” 
Hoffman, 455 U.S. at 494. 
“In determining whether a substantial amount of 
protected activity was affected, a court should evaluate the 
ambiguous as well as the unambiguous 
scope of the enactment.” 
Thus in evaluating whether a statute is overbroad or vague, 
- 17 -
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the scope of the prohibited conduct requires determination. 
Id.; see also United States v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 293 
(2008) (“The first step in overbreadth analysis is to construe the challenged statute; it is impossible to determine whether a statute reaches too far without first knowing what the statute covers.”). 
A. Scope of Prohibited Conduct 
The conduct prohibited by the offense of electronic 
enticement of a child in the first degree is stated as follows: 
(1) Any person who, using a computer or any other electronic
device: 
(a) Intentionally or knowingly communicates: 
(i) 	With a minor known by the person to be under
the age of eighteen years; 
(ii) 	With another person, in reckless disregard ofthe risk that the other person is under the ageof eighteen years, and the other person is
under the age of eighteen years; or 
(iii) 	With another person who represents that person
to be under the age of eighteen years; 
(b) With the intent to promote or facilitate the
commission of a felony: 
(i) 	That is a murder in the first or second degree; 
(ii) 	That is a class A felony; or 
(iii) 	That is another covered offense as defined in 
section 846E-1, 
agrees to meet with the minor, or with another person
who represents that person to be a minor under the ageof eighteen years; and 
(c) Intentionally or knowingly travels to the agreed upon
meeting place at the agreed upon meeting time . . . . 
HRS § 707-756(1) (emphases added). Therefore, HRS § 707-756 
contains three distinct conduct elements: (1) communication with

a Minor15 (communication element), (2) agreement to meet 
(agreement element), and (3) travel to the agreed place at the 
agreed time (travel element); (collectively, conduct elements). The scope of the applicability of the mens rea “intent to promote or facilitate the commission of a felony” (felonious intent) to the conduct elements has not been directly addressed by this court. 
1. Plain Language 
The fundamental starting point of statutory 
interpretation is the language of the statute itself. Hawaii 
Gov’t Emps. Ass’n v. Lingle, 124 Hawai ʻi 197, 202, 239 P.3d 1, 6 
(2010). Thus, where the statutory language is unambiguous, our duty is to give effect to its plain and obvious meaning. 
Id. 
The plain language and structure of HRS § 707-756 
indicate that the felonious intent does not apply to all of the conduct elements of HRS § 707-756. 
HRS § 707-756 includes three 
distinct elements with separate mens rea requirements: (a) intentionally or knowingly communicating with a Minor; (b) agreeing to meet the Minor with the intent to promote or facilitate the commission of a felony; and (c) intentionally or 
15 For convenience of discussion the term “Minor” includes all three 
categories encompassed by HRS § 707-756(1)(a): (1) a person known by the
actor to be under the age of eighteen years, (2) a person who represents tothe actor that the person is under the age of eighteen years, or (3) a personunder the age of eighteen years where the actor communicates with the person
in reckless disregard of the risk the person is underage. 
- 19 -
 
 
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
knowingly traveling to the agreed meeting place at the agreed 
time. Thus, for each element, there is a specific mental state 
that corresponds to the required physical act. 
The three elements are listed in discrete subsections: 
(1)(a), (1)(b), and (1)(c). Both the communication element of subsection (1)(a) and the traveling element of subsection (1)(c) must be “intentionally or knowingly” committed. HRS § 707-756(1)(a), (c). Only the second element of agreeing to meet the Minor in subsection (1)(b) must be made with “the intent to 
promote or facilitate the commission of a felony.” HRS § 707-
756(1)(b). There is nothing to indicate that the mens rea of the agreement element found in subsection (1)(b) was meant to apply to the communication and traveling elements found in subsections (1)(a) and (1)(c), respectively; such an interpretation of the statute is contrary to the plain and unambiguous meaning of the statute. 
Our reading of HRS § 707-756 is consistent with this 
court’s application of the statute in State v. McKnight,  131 
Hawaiʻi 379, 319 P.3d 298 (2013). In that case, the majority and 
the dissent, while not specifically analyzing the application of 
the felonious intent to the conduct elements, separated the 
felonious intent from the communication and traveling elements when discussing the statute. Id. at 389, 319 P.3d at 308 
(finding “it apparent that each of these elements serv[es] a 
- 20 -

 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
distinct purpose”); see also id. at 400, 319 P.3d at 319 
(Recktenwald, C.J., dissenting) (noting that “the statute 
requires the State to prove that the defendant did three things” and listing each element separately). 
2.
 Legislative History 
The legislative history of a statute remains relevant 
“even when the language appears clear upon perfunctory review.” 
Richardson v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 76 Hawai ʻi 46, 68-69, 868 
P.2d 1193, 1215-16 (1994). “Were this not the case, a court may be unable to adequately discern the underlying policy which the legislature seeks to promulgate and, thus, would be unable to determine if a literal construction would produce an absurd or unjust result, inconsistent with the policies of the statute.” Id. (quoting Survivors of Medeiros v. Maui Land & Pineapple Co., 66 Haw. 290, 297, 660 P.2d 1316, 1321 (1983)). 
The legislative history of HRS § 707-756 also supports 
an interpretation that the felonious intent applies only to the agreement element. 
When HRS § 707-756 was first enacted in 
2002, 2002 Haw. Sess. Laws. Act 200, § 1 at 841-42, the House Standing Committee on the Judiciary & Hawaiian Affairs reported that the purpose of the House Bill that eventually became HRS § 707-756 was “to deter crimes against minors by . . . prohibit[ing] the use of a computer or other electronic device to lure a minor to a meeting with intent to commit a felony.” 
- 21 -
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 417, in 2002 House Journal, at 1399 
(emphasis added). The Senate Standing Committee on Health and 
Human Services reported: 
Your Committee finds that the use of the Internet to entice 
children into meetings has become widespread. Current laws 
do not specifically address using computers to communicate
with minors for purposes of committing crime. 
This measure 
would close that loophole, and would allow sex offenders tobe investigated and prosecuted before they commit akidnapping or other crime. 
S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 2867, in 2002 Senate Journal, at 1384 
(emphasis added); see also  S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 3131, in 
2002 Senate Journal, at 1498 (using the same language). 
Interpreting the felonious intent so that it also 
applies to the travel element would appear inconsistent with the 
underlying policy of the statute, which is to protect children. H.
 Stand. Comm. No. 417, in 2002 House Journal, at 1399 (“The 
purpose of the bill is to deter crimes against minors.”). A person who arranges a meeting with a Minor with a felonious 
intent and then travels to that meeting presents an immediate 
physical danger to the Minor. 
See McKnight , 131 Hawai ʻi at 389, 
319 P.3d at 308 (“[R]equiring that the defendant travel to an 
agreed-upon meeting place at an agreed-upon meeting time ensures 
that an individual is prosecuted only in situations where his behavior poses an actual physical threat to the child.”). A statute that absolves a person from liability based upon the abandonment of felonious intent en route to the meeting would

not protect children in conformance with the purpose of the 
legislation.16 
3. Pari Materia 
“Laws in pari materia, or upon the same subject 
matter, shall be construed with reference to each other. What 
is clear in one statute may be called upon in aid to explain 
what is doubtful in another.” State v. Kaman ʻo, 118 Hawai ʻi 210, 
218, 188 P.3d 724, 732 (2008); see also HRS § 1-16 (1993). 
The offense of electronic enticement of a child in the 
second degree, HRS § 707-757 (Supp. 2013), which concerns the 
same subject matter as the first degree offense, HRS § 707-756, is defined as: 
(1) 	Any person who, using a computer or any other
electronic device: 
(a) Intentionally or knowingly communicates: 
(i) 	With a minor known by the person to be
under the age of eighteen years; 
(ii) 	With another person, in reckless disregardof the risk that the other person is underthe age of eighteen years, and the otherperson is under the age of eighteen years;or 
(iii) 	With another person who represents that
person to be under the age of eighteenyears; and 
(b) 	
With the intent to promote or facilitate thecommission of a felony, agrees to meet with the
minor, 
or with another person who represents
that person to be a minor under the age of
eighteen years; and 
16 If the felonious intent also applied to the travel element, then
its abandonment during the travel element would not permit the offense to becharged, even if that actor again changed his or her mind upon meeting the
Minor. 
- 23 -
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
(c) 	Intentionally or knowingly travels to the
agreed upon meeting place at the agreed uponmeeting time . . . . 
HRS § 707-757 (emphasis added). HRS § 707-757 directly links 
the felonious intent with the agreement element. Because HRS §§ 707-756 and 707-757 are manifestly in pari materia, the clarity with which HRS § 707-757 connects the felonious intent to the agreement element buttresses the conclusion that the intent of the legislature was to assign the felonious intent to the 
agreement element only. 
Therefore, in light of the plain language of HRS § 
707-756, its legislative history, and the doctrine of in pari 
materia, we conclude that the “intent to promote or facilitate the commission of a felony” set forth in the agreement element applies to that element only. 
B. Overbreadth 
Overbreadth analysis addresses laws that, if enforced, 
would allow the prosecution of constitutionally-protected conduct. 
Andrew E. Goldsmith, The Void-for-Vagueness Doctrine 
in the Supreme Court, Revisited, 30 Am. J. Crim. L. 279, 284 
n.39
 (2003). Overbreadth doctrine assumes that individuals 
understand what a statute prohibits and as a consequence, refrain from that behavior, even though some of it is protected. Id. 
- 24 -
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Generally, “one who alleges that a statute is 
unconstitutionally overbroad . . . must be directly affected by 
the claimed overbroad aspects.” Gaylord, 78 Hawai ʻi at 142, 890 
P.2d at 1182 (quoting State v. Tripp, 71 Haw. 479, 483, 795 P.2d 
280, 282 (1990)). That is, the doctrine is generally limited to 
challengers who allege that their innocent conduct has been improperly swept into the reach of the statute. Id. 
Alangcas admitted his intent to engage in sexual 
conduct with a Minor; thus, Alangcas cannot and does not assert that constitutionally protected conduct is being prosecuted by the State. 
Therefore, the law is not overbroad as applied to 
his conduct, and Alangcas does not have standing to challenge 
the law as overbroad on that basis. 
However, a law may be challenged as overbroad under 
two additional circumstances. 
A statute may be challenged as 
overbroad if it affects freedom of expression that is 
constitutionally protected. See Beltran , 116 Hawai ʻi at 150-51, 
172 P.3d at 462-63. A court may also entertain a facial 
overbreadth challenge when “the enactment reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct.” Id. at 152, 172 
P.3d at 464 (quoting Hoffman, 455 U.S. at 494.

 Constitutionally Protected Expression

amendment right to freedom of expression.

The First Amendment and article I, § 4 of the Hawai ʻi 
Constitution prohibit the enactment of any law that abridges 
freedom of speech.17 However, when the scienter requirement of a 
statute sufficiently limits criminal culpability to reach only 
conduct outside the protection of the First Amendment, 
legitimate speech is not endangered. United States v. Dhingra, 
371 F.3d 557, 561 (9th Cir. 2004). Thus, criminal sexual conduct, such as when the prosecution can prove that “one of the parties . . . intended to target a minor for criminal sexual activity,” “does not enjoy First Amendment protection.” 
United 
States v. Meek, 366 F.3d 705, 722 (9th Cir. 2004). 
In Dhingra and Meek, the Ninth Circuit Court of 
Appeals reviewed 18 USC § 2422(b),18 a federal anti-enticement

provision similar to HRS § 707-756. The Ninth Circuit held that 
“no . . . legitimate speech [is] jeopardized by § 2422 because 
the statute only criminalizes conduct, i.e. the targeted inducement of minors for illegal sexual activity.” 
Meek, 366 
F.3d at 721; see also Dhingra, 371 F.3d at 561. The court noted that speech is not protected when it is “merely the vehicle through which a pedophile ensnares the victim.” Meek, 366 F.3d 
at 721 (citing United States v. Rowlee, 899 F.2d 1275, 1278 (2d Cir. 1990)). “Because persuading [a minor] to engage in . . . 
sexual acts for which a person could be charged with a criminal 
offense comes closer to incitement than it does to general advocacy, the statute does not run afoul of the First Amendment.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, 
“inducement of minors to engage in illegal sexual activity enjoys no First Amendment protection.”

Meek also noted, “The potential for unconstitutional 
chilling of legitimate speech disappears because § 2422(b) 
requires the prosecution to prove that a defendant actually knows or believes that the specific target of the inducement is a minor.” 
Id.
 at 722. The statute required “the defendant to 
know or believe that the person whom he seeks to induce into sexual activity is a minor, § 2422(b) does not infringe on legitimate speech between adults.” 
Id.; see also United States 
v. Bailey,
 228 F.3d 637, 639 (6th Cir. 2000) (holding that 
§ 2422(b) “only affects those who intend to target minors”). 
State courts have come to the same conclusion that 
comparable electronic enticement statutes do not implicate freedom of expression because the laws only criminalize speech that is intended to entice a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct.

In this case, HRS § 707-756 requires proof of three 
conduct elements: (1) a communication with the Minor through the 
use of a computer or other electronic device, (2) an agreement to meet the Minor, and (3) traveling to the agreed place at the agreed time. Additionally, HRS § 707-756 contains a clear scienter requirement; in order to commit the offense, the agreement to meet must be made with the “intent to promote or 
facilitate the commission of a felony.”  HRS § 707-756(1)(b). 
The “felonious intent ensures that the defendant has a culpable 
state of mind at the time [the defendant] entices the child into 
meeting; and requiring that the defendant travel to an agreed-upon meeting place at an agreed-upon meeting time ensures that an individual is prosecuted only in situations where [the defendant’s] behavior poses an actual physical threat to the 
child.” 
McKnight , 131 Hawai ʻi at 389, 319 P.3d at 308.

person has a felonious intent at the time a meeting is arranged

place at the agreed upon meeting time. The statute only 
criminalizes speech when it is employed to arrange a meeting 
with a Minor with the intent to promote or facilitate commission 
of a felony. Since HRS § 707-756 does not implicate the freedoms of expression guaranteed under the First Amendment or 
article I, § 4 of the Hawai ʻi Constitution, Alangcas’ overbreadth 
challenge on that basis fails. 
2.
 Facial Challenge 
“[I]n a facial challenge to the overbreadth and 
vagueness of a law, a court’s first task is to determine whether 
the enactment reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally 
protected conduct.” Beltran, 116 Hawai ʻi at 152, 172 P.3d at 
464; see also United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. 460, 473 (2010) 
(holding that a law may be invalidated as overbroad if “a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the statute’s plainly legitimate 
sweep”).21   
Alangcas claims that HRS § 707-756 would criminalize 
“a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct”; “a 
21   In State v. Beltran, the ordinance at issue was one that banned
camping. Camping was defined as the use of a public park for living
accommodations, including making preparations to sleep or storing personalbelongings. Such activities constituted camping “regardless of the intent ofthe participants or the nature of any other activities in which they may also
be engaging.” Beltran, 116 Hawai ʻi 146, 149, 172 P.3d 458, 461 (2007). The 
Beltran court held that, by sweeping “any other activities” “regardless of
the intent of the participants” into its ambit, the ordinance cast a“limitless net” that “seemingly reach[ed] a substantial amount ofconstitutionally protected conduct.” Id. at 152, 172 P.3d at 464.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
sports coach, a music instructor, or just about anyone who works 
with or has children could be found guilty of violating [HRS 
§ 707-756] even though the only communication he or she ever had with the minor on a computer or electronic device was completely innocent.” 
As noted, HRS § 707-756 requires three conduct 
elements: (1) communication with the Minor via a computer or other electronic device; (2) an agreement to meet the Minor, made with the intent  to promote or facilitate the commission of 
a felony;  and (3) traveling to the agreed place at the agreed 
time. HRS § 707-756 solely affects conduct in which a person 
has a felonious intent at the time a meeting is arranged with the Minor and thereafter travels to the meeting place at the agreed meeting time. Innocently communicating with Minors via electronic devices and then meeting with those Minors is not prohibited by HRS § 707-756; thus, a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct is not implicated. 
A person’s freedom of movement has also been found to 
be a basis for challenging a statute under the overbreadth doctrine. See Kolender v. Lawson
, 461 U.S. 352, 358 (1983) 
(citing Aptheker v. Secretary of State,  378 U.S. 500, 505-06 
(1964); Kent v. Dulles, 357 U.S. 116, 126 (1958)). To the extent Alangcas raised the freedom of movement in his Application, any restriction on a person’s legitimate movements,

assuming complete abandonment of the felonious intent en route 
to the meeting place, would not sweep a substantial amount of 
constitutional conduct into HRS § 707-756’s ambit. The person’s freedom to travel would be limited only by the exclusion of that agreed upon location and only at that agreed time. 
Thus, HRS § 707-756 is not overbroad because it does 
not reach a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct. 
C. Vagueness 
1. Analyzing a Vagueness Challenge 
A penal statute is vague if it does not define a 
criminal offense “with sufficient definiteness [so] that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory 
enforcement.” Beltran, 116 Hawai ʻi at 151, 172 P.3d at 463. 
Thus, a statute is void for vagueness under article I, § 5 of the Hawai ʻi Constitution
22 if (1) it is internally inconsistent 
and incomprehensible to a person of ordinary intelligence, or 
(2) it invites delegation of basic policy matters to police for 
22 Article I, § 5 of the Hawai ʻi Constitution states as follows: 
No person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property
without due process of law, nor be denied the equalprotection of the laws, nor be denied the enjoyment of theperson’s civil rights or be discriminated against in theexercise thereof because of race, religion, sex or
ancestry.

- 33 - resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis.  Id. at 153, 172 
P.3d at 465.  
The United States Supreme Court “has often noted that 
criminal statutes are subject to stricter vagueness analysis 
than civil statutes.”  Goldsmith, supra, at 281  (citing Hoffman, 455 U.S. at 498-99; Nat’l Endowment for the Arts v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569, 588 (1998)) (referring to the criteria for issuing NEA grants and noting, “The terms of the provision are undeniably opaque, and if they appeared in a criminal statute or 
regulatory scheme, they could raise substantial vagueness 
concerns.”).  “Subject to an even stricter standard are criminal statutes that reach expression protected by the First Amendment, any other constitutional right, or any ‘fundamental right.’”  Id. (citing Smith v. Goguen, 415 U.S. 566, 573 (1974); Hoffman, 455 U.S. at 499; Rose v. Locke, 423 U.S. 48, 50 n.3 (1975) (per curiam)).
23  
Thus, as a criminal statute, HRS § 707-756 is subject 
to a “stricter vagueness analysis” than a civil statute.  However, the standard for demonstrating that a statute is contrary to our constitution remains high: “Every enactment of

the Hawai ʻi Legislature is presumptively constitutional, and the 
party challenging a statute has the burden of showing the 
alleged unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt.” State 
v. Bui, 104 Hawai ʻi 462, 466, 92 P.3d 471, 475 (2004). 
This court has recognized that a statute may be found 
void for vagueness on its face or as applied. See State v. 
Bates, 84 Hawai ʻi 211, 222, 933 P.2d 48, 59 (1997) (observing 
that where a case does not involve any first amendment issues, a “defendant has standing to raise a vagueness challenge only insofar as the statute is vague as applied to his or her 
specific conduct”); State v. Manzo
, 58 Haw. 440, 573 P.2d 945, 
955 (1977) (“ A statute may be overbroad because its vagueness 
extends its reach too far, and yet it may define the core of its 
coverage with sufficient specificity to avoid challenge for facial vagueness.”). 
In order for a defendant to succeed on an as-applied 
challenge, the defendant must demonstrate that the disputed statute is vague with respect to his or her conduct. Id. 
However, when a statute burdens a significant constitutional right, such as the freedom of expression, a defendant whose rights are not violated may raise the constitutional rights of 
others. See Beltran, 116 Hawai ʻi at 151 n.4, 172 P.3d at 463

In Beltran, this court held that a camping regulation 
was facially overbroad and vague. Id. at 151, 155, 172 P.3d at 
463, 467. The camping regulation was found to “conceivably” 
implicate activities “relating to freedom of movement and association, or that involve expressive conduct.” Id. at 152, 
172 P.3d at 464. In finding the statute facially overbroad and vague, the Beltran court relied on Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 353 (1983). 
  
Kolender “concerned a facial vagueness challenge to a 
criminal statute that require[d] persons who loiter or wander on the streets to provide a ‘credible and reliable’ identification and to account for their presence when requested by a peace officer.” 
Kolender,
 461 U.S. at 353. The Kolender court based 
its application of facial analysis on concerns for First Amendment liberties and the right to freedom of movement. Id. 
at 358; see also Beltran
, 116 Haw. at 151, 172 P.3d at 463. The 
Kolender court observed that a facial challenge of a law is 
permitted where the law “reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct.” 461 U.S. at 358 n.8. Kolender also concluded that that “where a statute imposes criminal penalties, the standard of certainty is higher.” 
Id. 
The Kolender  court expressly rejected the idea that a 
statute “should not be held unconstitutionally vague on its face unless it is vague in all of its possible applications.”

see also Beltran,  116 Hawai ʻi at 155, 172 P.3d at 467 (“Kolender, 
however, indicated that ‘[t]his concern has, at times, led us to 
invalidate a criminal statute on its face even when it could conceivably have had some valid application.’” (alteration in 
original) (quoting Kolender, 461 U.S. at 358 n.8)). Therefore, 
under Beltran’s adoption of Kolender, because a criminal statute requires higher certainty, it may “at times” be challenged for vagueness on its face “even when it could conceivably have had some valid application,” just as a facial challenge is permitted for overbreadth if the statute reaches a substantial amount of 
protected 
conduct.24 Beltran, 116 Hawai ʻi at 151, 172 P.3d at 
463. 
Thus, in analyzing vagueness challenges, this court 
first considers the meaning and specificity of the statute, and 
if the statute is vague, then the court determines whether the 
statute is vague as applied to the person’s specific conduct or 
implicates a significant constitutional protection, such as a first amendment right. 
24 Kolender  buttresses this argument by noting 
The dissent concedes that “the overbreadth doctrine permits
facial challenge of a law that reaches a substantial amount of
conduct protected by the First Amendment.” 
However, in the
dissent's view, one may not “ confuse vagueness and overbreadth  by
attacking the enactment as being vague as applied to conduct
other than his own
.” But we have traditionally viewed vagueness
and overbreadth as logically related and similar doctrines.

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
For example, in  Bates, 84 Hawai ʻi at 222, 933 P.2d at 
59, the court initially evaluated the challenged statute to 
determine whether a person of ordinary intelligence would know 
what conduct was prohibited. Bates, 84 Hawai ʻi at 222-226, 933 
P.2d at 59-63. Bates began its analysis by examining the 
legislative history of the relevant statute and reviewing 
federal courts’ interpretation of similar statutes in order to 
define the statutory terminology at issue. Id. at 222-224, 933 
P.2d at 59-61. Having properly defined the statute, the Bates 
court concluded a person of ordinary intelligence would know what conduct was prohibited, and therefore the court found the law was not unconstitutionally vague. Id. at 224-225, 933 P.2d 
at 61-62. Having reached this determination, the Bates court was not required to address the defendant’s standing in order to determine whether “the defendant [can] succeed on a vagueness 
challenge.” Id. at 222, 933 P.2d at 59. 
Similarly, in , a defendant challenged his 
prosecution for possession of burglar’s tools, arguing that 
“burglar’s tools,” as described in the statute, “could include anything used in the commission of a burglary.”
25 Bui, 104 
25 The statute stated that the subject offense was 
knowing[ ] possess[ion of] any explosive, tool, instrument,
or other article adapted, designed, or commonly used for
committing or facilitating the commission of an offense
involving forcible entry into premises or theft by a

Hawaiʻi at 463, 465; 92 P.3d at 472, 474. This court held that 
the statute was not vague because it described the proscribed 
conduct in ordinary and understandable terms and also adequately informed the public of how to avoid committing the offense. Id. 
at 465, 92 P.3d at 474. 
Thus, as in Bates, the court initially 
determined that the challenged statute was not vague, and as a consequence of its determination, the court had no reason to address whether the statute was vague as applied to the 
defendant’s conduct. 
Bui
, 104 Hawai ʻi at 465, 92 P.3d at 474. 
In summary, in resolving a challenge to a criminal 
statute as vague, the challenged statute is analyzed to 
determine if it (1) is internally inconsistent and incomprehensible to a person of ordinary intelligence, or (2) invites delegation of basic policy matters to police for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis. 
Beltran, 116 
Hawaiʻi at 153, 172 P.3d at 465. If the statute is determined to 
be vague, the challenger is then required to demonstrate that “the statute is vague as applied to his or her specific conduct” 
physical taking and the person intends to use the
explosive, tool, instrument, or article, or knows some
person intends ultimately to use it, in the commission ofthe offense of the nature described aforesaid . . . .

original) (quoting HRS § 708–812(1)(a) (1993)).

or demonstrate that the statute burdens a significant 
constitutional right such as a first amendment right.26 
We have already determined that HRS § 707-756 does not 
burden freedom of expression under the First Amendment or 
Article I, § 4 of the Hawai ʻi Constitution or the freedom of 
movement. Alangcas has not alleged other significant 
constitutional rights that are burdened by the asserted vagueness of HRS § 707-756. Thus, we look first to determine whether HRS § 707-756 is unconstitutionally vague, and if so, whether it is vague as applied to Alangcas’ conduct. 
2. Application of Vagueness Analysis 
HRS § 707-756(1) provides that the agreement to meet 
with the Minor at a certain place and at a certain time may occur with the intent to promote or facilitate murder, a class A felony, or, alternatively, “[w]ith intent to promote or facilitate the commission of a felony . . . that is another 
covered offense as defined in HRS § 846E-1.” HRS § 707-756(1) 
(emphasis added). HRS § 846E-1 is the definition section of the State’s sex offender registration Chapter. 
Id. HRS § 846E-1 
defines two types of “covered offenses”; a “covered offense” 
26 Thus, the statement of the ICA that “before a law may be held to
be unduly vague, . . . it must be demonstrated that the law is impermissibly
vague in all its applications,”  Alangcas,  131 Hawai ʻi at 325, 318 P.3d at 615, 
is contrary to our prior decision in Beltran. 116 Hawai ʻi at 154-55, 172 P.3d
at 466-67 (permitting a vagueness challenge to “invalidate a criminal statute
on its face even when it could conceivably have had some valid application”).

means a criminal offense that is either (1) a “crime[] against 
[a] minor[]” or (2) a “sexual offense.” HRS § 846E-1 (Supp. 
2009). For each covered offense, the statute lists crimes that are included in the definition, and each definition also includes a Catch-all Clause providing that the definition includes any criminal offense that “is comparable to or that 
exceeds” one of the listed offenses.
27 Beltran, 116 Hawai ʻi at 
152, 172 P.3d at 464. 
27 A “crime[] against [a] minor” includes 
(1) Kidnapping of a minor, by someone other than a
parent; 
(2) Unlawful imprisonment in the first or second degree
that involves the unlawful imprisonment of a minor by
someone other than a parent; 
(3) An act, as described in chapter 705, that is an
attempt, criminal solicitation, or criminal conspiracy tocommit one of the offenses designated in paragraph (1) or(2); 
(4) A criminal offense that is comparable to or which
exceeds one of the offenses designated in paragraphs (1)through (3); or 
(5) Any federal, military, out-of-state, tribal, or
foreign conviction for any offense that, under the laws ofthis State, would be a crime against minors as designatedin paragraphs (1) through (4). 
HRS § 846E-1 (emphases added). Similarly, a “sexual offense” is defined asan offense that is, 
(1)  Set forth in section 707-730(1), 707-731(1), 707-
732(1), 707-733(1)(a), 707-733.6, 712-1202(1), or 712-1203(1), but excludes conduct that is criminal only becauseof the age of the victim, as provided in section 707-730(1)(b), or section 707-732(1)(b) if the perpetrator is
under the age of eighteen;

(A) Criminal sexual conduct toward a minor, including but

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
conviction from another jurisdiction that would be a “crime 
against [a] minor” or a “sexual offense” under Hawai ʻi law is 
also included in the definition for each covered offense. Thus, 
both types of covered offenses appear to be broadened by the 
Catch-all Clauses and the Conviction Clauses. 
Alangcas argues that HRS § 707-756 is 
unconstitutionally vague due to its incorporation of the 
definition of “covered offenses” from HRS § 846E-1. Alangcas contends the Conviction Clauses and the Catch-all Clauses introduce unconstitutional vagueness into HRS § 707-756 because “[p]ersons of ordinary intelligence are left to guess and no doubt differ in opinion as to what offenses are ‘comparable to’ 
or ‘exceed’ the offenses mentioned in the statute.” “Such 
guesswork,” Alangcas concludes, “not only among citizens, but among police officers, creates a danger of discriminatory enforcement on an ad hoc and subjective basis.” Additionally, as a separate vagueness challenge, Alangcas contends that because the word “communicate” is undefined, HRS § 707-756 is constitutionally flawed. 
a. Catch-all Clauses 
To reiterate, under Beltran, a penal statute is void 
for vagueness unless the criminal offense is defined “with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage

arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.” Beltran, 116 Hawai ʻi 
at 151, 172 P.3d at 463. Thus, a challenged statute is examined 
as to whether it is internally inconsistent and incomprehensible to a person of ordinary intelligence or invites delegation of 
basic policy matters to police for resolution on an ad hoc and 
subjective basis. Id. at 153, 172 P.3d at 465. 
A statute that is internally inconsistent may prevent 
a person of ordinary intelligence from knowing what conduct is prohibited.
28 Id. at 151, 172 P.3d at 463. However, HRS § 707 -
756(1) is not internally inconsistent. 
There is nothing about 
the reference in HRS § 707-756(1)(b)(iii) to the covered offenses in HRS § 846E-1 that contradicts any other part of the 
prohibition of electronic enticement in HRS § 707-756. 
A statute is not incomprehensible if “a person of 
ordinary intelligence would be able to ascertain the nature of 
conduct prohibited.” Bui, 104 Hawai ʻi at 465, 92 P.3d at 474. 
The ICA in this case held that the “exceeds” language in the 
Catch-all Clauses introduced unconstitutional vagueness into HRS 
§ 707-756, Alangcas, 131 Hawai ʻi at 325, 318 P.3d at 615, but 
28 One standard for an internally inconsistent statute was
highlighted in Beltran: a law is inconsistent if it instructs that a
violation occurs where “it reasonably appears, in light of the circumstances,
that the participants in conducting these activities, are in fact using the
area as a living accommodation regardless of the intent of the participantsor the nature of any activities in which they may also be engaging,’” becauseof the conflict between “reasonably appears” and “in fact.” Beltran, 116 
Hawaiʻi at 153, 172 P.3d at 465.

that the “comparable” language in the Catch-all Clauses did not 
suffer the same deficiency. Id. at 321-22, 325, 318 P.3d at 
611-612, 615. 
HRS § 707-756(1)(b) requires  that the actor intend to 
promote or facilitate a “felony.” Thus, the qualifying “covered 
offense” set forth in HRS § 846E-1 must be a felony. HRS § 707
-
756(1)(b). That is, whatever covered offense may be alleged as part of the mens rea to the agreement element of an electronic enticement prosecution, including an offense that is “comparable 
to” or that “exceeds” a crime against a Minor or a sexual 
offense, the intended conduct must be classified as a felony by 
the Hawai ʻi legislature.
29 
A person of ordinary intelligence would know that 
intending to promote or facilitate a felony, as defined by 
29 HRS § 701-107 provides the following regarding grades and classes
of offenses: 
(1)	 An offense defined by this Code or by any other
statute of this State
 for which a sentence of 
imprisonment is authorized constitutes a crime.
Crimes are of three grades: felonies, misdemeanors,
and petty misdemeanors. Felonies include murder in first and second degrees, attempted murder in the
first and second degrees, and the following three
classes: class A, class B, and class C. 
(2)
	 A crime is a felony if it is so designated in thisCode or if persons convicted thereof may be sentencedto imprisonment for a term which is in excess of one
year. 
HRS § 701-107 (1993) (emphases added). Consequently, a crime is a “felony”
if it is so designated by the Hawai ʻi penal code or if another statute of this
State authorizes a sentence of “imprisonment for a term which is in excess of
one year.” HRS § 701-107(2). 
- 44 -
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Hawaiʻi law, against a Minor is prohibited. Future cases may 
reveal a dispute as to whether a given felony is actually 
“comparable to” or actually “exceeds” the listed offenses included within the covered offenses, such that a question is 
present as to whether the intent to promote or facilitate the 
felony was properly included as a mens rea in a prosecution under HRS § 707-756. However, such a hypothetical dispute is irrelevant to a vagueness challenge to HRS § 707-756 because there is no question that a person of ordinary intelligence would have a reasonable opportunity to know that, as a felony, the intended conduct upon a Minor was indeed prohibited. To put it another way, when the intended conduct in question is 
indisputably proscribed by Hawai ʻi law as a felony, a person 
cannot complain in a vagueness challenge that the person is 
rendered unsure as to whether the intent to promote or 
facilitate that conduct upon a Minor is against the law. Thus, 
the reference to HRS § 846E-1 does not render HRS § 707-756 incomprehensible to a person of ordinary intelligence. 
Bui, 104 
Hawaiʻi at 465, 92 P.3d at 474 (“Consequently, we conclude a 
person of ordinary intelligence would be able to ascertain the nature of conduct prohibited.”). 
The same analysis eliminates the concern of “a 
delegation of basic policy matters to police resolution on an ad 
hoc and subjective basis,” 
Beltran, 116 Hawai ʻi at 153, 172 P.3d 
- 45 -
 
 
                                                 
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
at 465, because if the intended conduct is already prohibited as 
a felony, there is no concern of arbitrary or subjective police 
enforcement. That is, so long as the intended conduct designated as a felony in Hawaii’s statutory code is not defined so vaguely as to permit “arbitrary and discriminatory 
enforcement,” 
Gaylord,  78 Hawai ʻi at 138, 890 P.2d at 1178, 
prosecuting the intent to promote or facilitate such conduct 
under the electronic enticement prohibition does not jeopardize consistent nondiscriminatory enforcement. 
Thus, as the Catch-all Clauses are narrowed in 
application to HRS § 707-756 by the requirement that the intended conduct be a felony, they are neither incomprehensible 
to a person of ordinary intelligence, nor do they risk 
subjective or arbitrary enforcement by police. 
Therefore, HRS 
§ 707-756 is not unconstitutionally vague.30 As the statute is 
not vague, the question of whether the statute is vague as applied to Alangcas’ conduct is inapplicable. 
30 Had this court determined that the term “exceeds” introduced 
unconstitutional vagueness, as set forth supra in section II.C.1, into either
HRS §§ 707-756 or 846E-1, it is noted that an offending portion of a statute
may be severable such that the remaining portion of the law is
constitutional. “A part of a statute may be unconstitutional and at the same
time the remainder may be upheld as constitutional.” Hawaiian Trust Co. v. 
Smith, 31 Haw. 196, 202 (Haw. Terr. 1929); see also Nelson v. Miwa, 56 Haw.
601, 611, 546 P.2d 1005, 1013 (1976) (“Where part of a statute isunconstitutional [but] is inseparable from the remainder, the whole statute
is invalid.”).

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
b. Conviction Clauses 
The effect of the Conviction Clauses is to require 
registration by sex offenders and other covered offenders under 
HRS Chapter 846E for particular convictions from other jurisdictions; that is, completed conduct in another jurisdiction. HRS §§ 846E-1, 846E-2. In contrast, HRS § 707-
756 prohibits conduct committed with the intent to facilitate or 
promote a felony; i.e. relating to uncompleted or future conduct. The scope of HRS § 707-756 is not broadened by the reference in HRS § 846E-1 to convictions in other jurisdictions because it is of no meaning to say that a person has the “intent to promote or facilitate” completed conduct; one cannot have the legal intent to do what one has already done. Thus, with regard to the Conviction Clauses, the ICA correctly determined that HRS 
§ 707-756 does not incorporate convictions from other 
jurisdictions, and therefore the statute is not 
unconstitutionally vague on that basis.
31 Alangcas,  131 Hawai ʻi 
at 321, 318 P.3d at 611. 
31 However, the incorporation of the Conviction Clauses into HRS
§ 707-756 through HRS § 846E-1 is not “redundant,” Alangcas,  131 Hawai ʻi at 
321, 318 P.3d at 611, but instead, it is of no substantive legal effect.

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
c. “Communicates” 
Alangcas suggests that the word “communicates” in HRS 
§ 707-756(1)(a) is vague because it is undefined;32 he argues 
that this vagueness invites arbitrary enforcement by police. 
However, the “likelihood that anyone would not 
understand any of those common words seems quite remote” when a 
statute includes a scienter element requiring a felonious 
intent. See Hill v. Colorado, 530 U.S. 703, 732 (2000). Thus, 
when read with the rest of the statute, it is unlikely that the public will misunderstand “communicates” because of the clear requirements of the statute defining the prohibited communication. 
First, the communication must be made 
intentionally or knowingly. Second, the communication must be with a Minor; thus, at a minimum the person must consciously 
disregard a substantial risk that the other person is less than 
eighteen years of age. Third, the communication itself is not sufficient; it must be made in conjunction with an agreement to meet the Minor, with the intent to promote or facilitate a felony. Delimited by these three requirements, the general public is clearly informed of the nature of the “communication” 
32 The subsection defines the prohibited conduct, in part as, “[a]ny
person who, using a computer or any other electronic device[] [i]ntentionally
or knowingly communicates . . . with a minor.” HRS § 707-756(1).

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
that is prohibited. Consequently, there is nothing internally 
inconsistent about the reference to “communicates.” 
Further, as the communication and agreement elements 
must then be consummated with an intentional or knowing travel 
to the agreed upon place at the agreed upon time, there is little risk that police will enforce HRS § 707-756 in an arbitrary, ad hoc, or subjective manner. The term “communicates” is accordingly not vague. 
Thus, as the Catch-all Clauses, the Conviction 
Clauses, and the term “communicates” provide citizens of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what conduct is prohibited and provides explicit standards for those who apply the statute to do so in a consistent and nondiscriminatory manner, HRS § 707-756 is not unconstitutionally vague on these bases.
33 Accordingly, we do 
not consider whether the statute is vague as applied to the specific conduct charged to Alangcas. 
D. Dormant Commerce Clause 
The doctrine of the dormant commerce clause is a 
result implied from the federal government’s exclusive authority 
33 As the overbreadth analysis, supra, has already determined that
HRS § 707-756 does not infringe on protected speech, we do not again address
such contentions under a vagueness analysis of HRS § 707-756.

to control interstate commerce34 and may require a court to 
invalidate a state law that interferes with that authority. 
Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc. , 397 U.S. 137, 142 (1970). 
Where the statute regulates even-handedly to effectuate a
legitimate local public interest,  and its effects on
interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld
unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly
excessive in relation to the putative local benefits. . . .If a legitimate local purpose is found, then the questionbecomes one of degree. And the extent of the burden that 
will be tolerated will of course depend on the nature of
the local interest involved, and on whether it could bepromoted as well with a lesser impact on interstateactivities. 
Id. (emphases added). Thus, when a law does not express any 
purpose to discriminate against commerce to or from another 
state, the doctrine of the dormant commerce clause is implicated only when the state law has more than an incidental effect on interstate commerce.

Commerce is economic activity. United States v. 
Morrison,  529 U.S. 598, 610 (holding that Congress may not 
regulate noneconomic, violent criminal conduct based solely on 
that conduct’s aggregate effect on interstate commerce); see 
also id.  at 628-35 (Souter, J., dissenting) (opposing the 
34 The U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate
commerce “with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the
Indian tribes.” U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3. 
35 When a law purports to discriminate between states in an economic
regulation, it is generally invalid. “Time and again [the Supreme] Court hasheld that, in all but the narrowest circumstances, state laws violate theCommerce Clause if they mandate differential treatment of in-state and out-of-state economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter.”

majority’s ruling, in part based on the “the mountain of data 
assembled by Congress . . . showing the effects . . . on 
interstate commerce”). HRS § 707-756 does not purport to regulate any type of economic transaction. See Am. Libraries 
Ass’n v. Pataki, 969 F. Supp. 160, 163 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) (holding that a New York law that regulated commercial dissemination of pornographic material violated dormant commerce clause doctrine). 
Where legitimate commerce is not burdened by a state 
law, the doctrine of the dormant commerce clause is inapplicable. See People v. Foley, 731 N.E.2d 123, 133 (N.Y. 
2000) (upholding a luring statute and stating, “We are hard pressed to ascertain any legitimate commerce that is derived from the intentional transmission of sexually graphic images to minors for the purpose of luring them into sexual activity. Indeed, the conduct sought to be sanctioned by Penal Law § 
235.22 is of the sort that deserves no ‘economic’ protection.”); 
State v. Backlund, 672 N.W.2d 431, 438 (N.D. 2003) (concluding 
that North Dakota’s electronic child luring statute did not violate the dormant commerce clause because “it is difficult to ascertain any legitimate commerce that is derived from the willful transmission of explicit or implicit sexual communications to a person believed to be a minor in order to willfully lure that person into sexual activity”); Cashatt v.

State, 873 So.2d 430, 436 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2004) (“The state 
has a compelling interest in protecting minors from being 
seduced to perform sexual acts, and no legitimate commerce is burdened by penalizing the transmission of harmful sexual material to known minors in order to seduce them.”). 
Alangcas did not identify any legitimate commerce 
directly burdened by HRS § 707–756. 
As the ICA noted, “it is 
difficult to conceive of any legitimate commerce that would be burdened by penalizing predatory communication.” 
Alangcas,  131 
Hawaiʻi at 328, 318 P.3d at 618. To the extent that 
communication between individuals of a personal and non-economic nature, criminal or otherwise, is economic activity by virtue of 
that communication being channeled through “a computer or any 
other electronic device,” Algancas has not demonstrated that there would be any effect—incidental or otherwise—upon interstate commerce resulting from the effect of HRS § 707-756. Thus, Alangcas’ challenge to the validity of HRS § 707-756 under the doctrine of the dormant commerce clause is without merit as the electronic enticement statutory prohibition does not interfere with, or does not involve, interstate commerce. 
IV.
 Conclusion 
Based upon the plain language of the statute, its 
legislative history, and principles of statutory construction, we hold that the felonious intent of HRS § 707-756 applies only

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
to the agreement element of that statute. Having duly 
considered the scope of the statute, HRS § 707-756 is neither 
unconstitutionally overbroad nor vague; further, its application does not violate the dormant commerce clause. 
For the reasons set forth in this opinion, the orders 
of the circuit court filed September 17, 2009, and the judgment on appeal of the ICA, filed January 14, 2014, are affirmed.
