OPINION OF THE COURT BY MCKENNA, J.
 
I. Introduction
 
Following the publication of this court’s opinion in Nelson
 
v. Hawaiian Homes Comm’n, 127 Hawai‘ i 185, 277 P.3d 279 (2012), 
Respondents/Plaintiffs-Appellants Richard Nelson III, Kaliko
 
Chun, James Akiona, Sr., Sherilyn Adams, Kelii Ioane, Jr., and
 Charles Aipia (collectively “Plaintiffs”), represented by Native
 Hawaiian Legal Corporation (“NHLC”) requested attorneys’ fees and
 costs
2 as the prevailing party, pursuant to the private attorney
 
general doctrine. Both the State of Hawai ‘i and the Department 
3
of Hawaiian Home Lands filed objections  to Plaintiffs’ request,
arguing, inter alia, that Plaintiffs were not the prevailing
 party, that Plaintiffs do not qualify for an award of fees under
 the private attorney general doctrine, and that sovereign
 
immunity bars an award of fees in any event.
 Additionally, DHHL
 
2 NHLC has requested both trial and appellate attorneys’ fees and costs.
 
This opinion will address only appellate attorneys’ fees and costs. 
“[D]ecisions about fees incurred at the trial level are more properly within
the trial court’s discretion.”   S. Utsunomiya Enters., Inc. v. Moomuku Country
 
Club, 76 Hawai ‘i 396, 402, 879 P.2d 501, 507 (1994).  
3 Prior to filing their objections, the State filed a “Motion to Determine
 
Plaintiffs’ Entitlement to Attorneys Fees (Including Applicability of Private
Attorney General Doctrine) before Requiring Opposition as to amount of Fees,”
and DHHL filed its joinder in the State’s Motion.  Because both the State and
 DHHL subsequently filed memoranda in opposition to the Plaintiffs’ request,
these initial motions are hereby denied as moot.
 
2
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
objected to the request for costs as inadequately documented. 
For reasons that follow, we deny Plaintiffs’ request for
 appellate attorneys’ fees as barred by the State’s sovereign
 immunity. We also deny Plaintiffs’ request for appellate costs
 without prejudice.
 
II. Discussion
 
A. Prevailing Party
 
The first step in analyzing whether Plaintiffs are entitled
 
to attorneys’ fees (and costs) is to determine whether they are
 
the “prevailing party.” The “prevailing party” is the one who
 “prevails on the disputed main issue[.]” Food Pantry, Ltd. v.
 
Waikiki Business Plaza, Inc., 58 Haw. 606, 620, 575 P.2d 869, 879
 (1978). Even if the party does not prevail “to the extent of
 his original contention, he will be deemed to be the successful
 party for the purpose of taxing costs and attorney’s fees.” Id.
 
(citation and footnote omitted).
 
“The trial court is required to first identify the principle
 
issues raised by the pleadings and proof in a particular case,
 and then determine, on balance, which party prevailed on the
 issues.” MFD Partners v. Murphy, 9 Haw. App. 509, 515, 850 P.2d
 
713, 716 (1992). In the circuit court, the principle issues
 raised were:
 
Count I:  The State violated its constitutional duty to
sufficiently fund DHHL in order to rehabilitate native
Hawaiian beneficiaries, under the Hawai#i State
 
3
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Const
itution =s Article XII, Sections 1 and 2   
Count 2:  DHHL violated the constitution and breached its 
trust obligation to beneficiaries to seek  sufficient funds
from the legislature.   
Count 3:  The DHHL Defendants breached their trust 
obligation to beneficiaries by leasing DHHL lands for
commercial purposes to raise funds.      
Count 4:  The DHHL Defendants breached their obligation to
trust beneficiaries by failing to ascertain whether trustlands are necessary for general homestead purposes beforeoffering them for commercial lease.   
The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of the State
 
and DHHL on Counts 1 and 2 based on the political question
 doctrine. The parties entered into a Stipulation to Dismiss
 
Count 3 without prejudice and Count 4 with prejudice.  On
 
balance, before the trial court, the Defendants were the
 
prevailing parties, securing summary judgment in their favor on
 the first two counts and a dismissal with prejudice on the fourth
 count. 
Before the ICA, Plaintiffs prevailed on Counts I and II (or
 
at least succeeded in reversing summary judgment and securing a
 remand), as the ICA held that the political question doctrine did
 not bar the determination of what constituted sufficient sums
 that (1) the State must provide to DHHL and that (2) DHHL must
 
request. See Nelson v. Hawaiian Homes Comm’n
, 124 Hawai' i 437, 
447, 246 P.3d 369, 379 (App. 2011). 
On certiorari, however, only the State further appealed the
 
ICA’s decision as to Count I, and the principle issue raised was 
Does the political question doctrine bar Hawaiian Homes
Commission Act (HHCA) beneficiaries from using Haw. Const.
 
4
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Article XII, Section 1’s “sufficient sums” provision to
demand more legislative funding of the Department of
Hawaiian Home lands (DHHL), when that provision provides no
guidance at all as to how quickly homesteads must be
developed?
 
This court held that the political question doctrine did not bar
 
determination of what constituted “sufficient sums” for one of
 four enumerated purposes under Article XII, Section 1: 
administrative and operating expenses. Nelson, 127 Hawai‘ i at 
188, 277 P.3d at 282. 
Thus, the extent to which Plaintiffs
 
“prevailed” is at issue. 
This court has previously given guidance on determining
 
which party prevailed in a case in which the relief granted was
 
not solely in favor of one party. In 
Food Pantry, 58 Haw. at
 
620, 575 P.2d at 879, which involved a lease dispute, this court
 determined that the lessor was the prevailing party, even though
 the lessee did receive the relief he requested. In that case,
 the trial court found that the lessor was required to consent to
 a sublease under the lease, that the lessee materially breached
 that provision of the lease, and that the lessor was entitled to
 terminate the lease. Id. Even though the trial court granted
 
the lessee’s requested relief (that the lease not be forfeited
 and that damages for the breach be paid instead), the lessor was,
 “on balance,” the successful party in the case, based on the
 pleadings and proof. Id. 
In this case, although the State received the relief it
 
5
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
requested on certiorari (that the political question bar the
 
determination of what constitutes “sufficient sums” for the
 development of homestead lots), Plaintiffs are the prevailing
 party, because this court affirmed the ICA’s judgment, albeit on
 a narrower ground that the political question doctrine did not
 bar determination of what constituted “sufficient sums” for
 administrative and operating expenses only. More importantly,
 part of Plaintiffs’ claims against the State survived, in that
 the circuit court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of the
 state was vacated, and this case has been remanded to the circuit
 court for further proceedings. 
Having established that Plaintiffs prevailed on appeal, we
 
next examine whether the private attorney general doctrine
 entitles them to an award of attorneys’ fees. 
B. Private Attorney General Doctrine 
Normally, “pursuant to the ‘American Rule,’ each party is 
responsible for paying his or her own litigation expenses. This general rule, however, is subject to a number of exceptions,” including the private attorney general doctrine. Sierra Club v. 
Dep’t of Transp., 120 Hawai‘ i 181, 218, 202 P.3d 1226, 1263 
(2009). In In re Water Use Permit Applications, 96 Hawai‘ i 27, 
29, 25 P.3d 802, 804 (2001)(“Waiahole”), this court first recognized the private attorney general doctrine, which it 
6
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
summarized as follows:
 
The doctrine is an equitable rule that allows courts in
their discretion to award attorneys’ fees to plaintiffs who
have “vindicated important public rights.”  Courts applying
 this doctrine consider three basic factors:
 
“(1) the strength or societal importance of the public
policy vindicated by the litigation, (2) the necessity
for private enforcement and the magnitude of the
resultant burden on the plaintiff, (3) the number of
people standing to benefit from the decision.”
 
(citing Serrano v. Priest, 569 P.3d 1303, 1314 (Cal. 1977)). 
This court, however, declined to apply the doctrine. Id. It
 
held that the plaintiffs met the first and third prongs of the
 doctrine, as the underlying case “involved constitutional rights
 of profound significance [i.e., the apportionment of water
 rights], and all of the citizens of the state, present and
 
future, stood to benefit from the decision.” 96 Hawai‘ i at 31, 
25 P.3d at 806. But it also held that the plaintiffs had not met
 
the second prong because they were merely one of several parties
 who “challenged the decision of a tribunal (the Commission on
 Water Resource Management or “CWRM”) in an adversarial proceeding
 not contesting any action or policy of the government” and in
 which the government had not “either completely abandoned, or
 
actively opposed, the plaintiffs’ cause.” 96 Hawai‘ i at 31-32, 
25 P.3d at 806-07. Although declining to award attorneys’ fees 
under the private attorney general doctrine in that case, this court did not foreclose the application of the doctrine “in any 
future case. . . .” 96 Hawai‘ i at 32, 25 P.3d at 807. 
7
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
In Maui Tomorrow v. State, 110 Hawai‘ i 234, 245, 131 P.3d 
517, 528 (2006), this court once again declined to apply the 
doctrine to award attorneys’ fees. In that case, the plaintiffs had succeeded in appealing a decision of the Board of Land and Natural Resources (“BLNR”) to the circuit court, which remanded the matter for further findings, because that agency had not fulfilled its constitutional duty to protect customary and traditional native Hawaiian rights. See id. Although this court 
recognized that the plaintiffs’ agency appeal qualified as contesting a governmental policy under the second prong of the private attorney general doctrine, it noted that the BLNR did not “abandon” or “actively oppose” the plaintiffs’ cause; it merely mistakenly assumed that the CWRM was responsible for fulfilling the constitutional duty. Id. Therefore, this court found that 
the plaintiffs’ case had not fully met the second prong of the private attorney general doctrine and concluded that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in declining to award fees. Id. 
This court did affirm the trial court’s award of attorneys’ 
fees under the private attorney general doctrine in Sierra Club, in which the plaintiffs challenged an exemption of the Superferry 
project from Hawai‘ i’s environmental protection statutes. 120 
Hawai‘i at 230, 202 P.3d at 1275. As to the first prong, this 
8
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
court concluded that the Sierra Club plaintiffs vindicated an 
important public policy: they “establish[ed] the principle of procedural standing in environmental law in Hawaii and clarif[ied] the importance of addressing the secondary impacts of a project in the environmental review process pursuant to HRS 
Chapter 343.” 120 Hawai‘ i at 220, 202 P.3d at 1265. As to the 
second prong, this court concluded that the plaintiffs’ suit was 
necessary because the DOT “wholly abandoned that duty [to consider both the primary and secondary impacts of the Superferry project on the environment] by issuing an erroneous exemption to 
the Superferry.” 120 Hawai‘ i at 221, 202 P.3d at 1266. As to 
the third prong, this court stated that the plaintiffs’ case 
benefited society as a whole. Id. In short, the plaintiffs met 
all three requirements entitling them to an award of attorneys’ fees under the private attorney general doctrine. 
In the instant case, Plaintiffs arguably met all three
 
prongs, entitling them to attorneys’ fees under the private
 attorney general doctrine. First, the “strength or societal
 importance of the public policy” they vindicated by their
 litigation was that the State now must fund DHHL’s administrative
 and operating expenses. As a result, DHHL will be able to shift
 the funds it was spending on administrative and operating
 expenses towards fulfilling its trust duties to its
 
9
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
beneficiaries. In general, this court has stated, “It is
 
undisputed that the rights of native Hawaiians are a matter of
 great public concern in Hawaii.” Pele Defense Fund v. Paty, 73
 
Haw. 578, 614, 837 P.3d 1247, 1268 (1992). 
Second, it was necessary for Plaintiffs to resort to private
 
enforcement, as the State made it clear for years that it did not
 believe it had a duty to sufficiently fund DHHL, and DHHL for
 years had not requested sufficient sums from the legislature. 
The State and DHHL had clearly abandoned or actively opposed
 Plaintiffs’ request that the State sufficiently fund DHHL. 
Third, the number of people standing to benefit from the
 
Nelson decision is substantial. At the very least, a shift in
 funding for administrative and operating expenses provides a
 benefit to the Hawaiian Home Lands trust, impacting at least the
 tens of thousands of known beneficiaries on the waiting list, and
 ultimately benefitting the State as a whole, because stewardship
 of Hawaiian Home Lands was an obligation taken on by the State as
 a condition for admission into the union. See Admission Act,
 
Pub. L. No. 86-3, 73 Stat. 4 (1959) § 4. In short, Plaintiffs
 have arguably established an entitlement to attorneys’ fees under
 the private attorney general doctrine.
 
However, the analysis does not end with the establishment of
 
a right to fees under the doctrine. In analyzing the Sierra Club
 
10
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fee request under the private attorney
 
general doctrine, this court also noted, “Application of the
 private attorney general doctrine is . . . subject to the
 defenses which a defendant may have” and explored, inter alia,
 the State’s defense of sovereign immunity. Sierra Club, 120
 
Hawai‘i at 221, 225-29, 202 P.3d at 1266, 1270-74. In this case, 
the State and DHHL have both raised the defense of sovereign
 immunity as to the requested fees.
 
C. Sovereign Immunity
 
“The doctrine of sovereign immunity ‘refers to the general
 
rule, incorporated in the Eleventh Amendment to the United States
 Constitution, that a state cannot be sued in federal court
 without its consent or an express waiver of its immunity. The
 doctrine . . . also precludes such suits in state courts.’” 120
 
Hawai‘i at 225-26, 202 P.3d at 1270-71 (citations omitted). 
“It is well established that the State as sovereign is immune
 
from suit except as it consents to be sued.” Figueroa v. State,
 
61 Haw. 369, 381, 604 P.2d 1198, 1205 (1979)(citations omitted). 
In Sierra Club, we stated
 
“[A]n award of costs and fees to a prevailing party is
inherently in the nature of a damage award.” [ 4
]  Fought, 87
 
4
  The Concurrence/Dissent cites Fought for the proposition that “[a]n
 
award
 of fees and costs grounded in the inherent equitable power of the court
is incidental to the underlying suit to which it is attached and thus cannot
conceptually be denominated as in the nature of a separate damages award.” 
Concurrence/Dissent at II.B (emphasis in Concurrence/Dissent).  Respectfully,
 Fought observed the opposite:  “[T]axation of costs and attorneys’ fees is
 
11
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Hawai ‘i 37, 51, 951 P.2d 487, 501 (1998).  Accordingly, to
properly award attorney’s fees and costs against [the State]
in this case, there must be “a clear relinquishment” of the
State’s immunity in this case.   Bush [v. Watson, 81 Hawai ‘i 
474, 481, 918 P.2d 1130, 1137 (1996)].
 
Sierra Club, 120 Hawai‘ i at 226, 202 P.3d at 1271. It is true 
that sovereign immunity did not bar the Plaintiffs’ underlying
 
claims, which were for declaratory and injunctive relief for
 violations of Article XII, Section 1, and not damages. See
 
Kaho‘ohanohano v. State, 114 Hawai‘ i 302, 337, 162 P.3d 696, 731 
(1992)(“[S]overeign immunity will not be a bar where governmental
 action is challenged as unconstitutional.”) (citing Pele Defense
 Fund, 73 Haw. at 607, 837 P.2d at 1265). However, that sovereign
 immunity was no bar to the underlying claim “does not necessarily
 
result in a right to attorneys’ fees.” Taomae, 110 Hawai‘ i at 
333, 132 P.3d at 1244.
 
Plaintiffs’ arguments parallel the analysis in the Sierra
 
Club decision. They argue that the waiver of sovereign immunity
 
for private attorney general fees in this case is statutory. 
“This court has noted that the State has waived immunity to suit
 
5 
only to the extent as specified in HRS chapters 661  and 662 6.” 
essentially an award of damages. . . .”  87 Hawai ‘i at 52, 951 P.2d at 502 
(emphasis added).  It would appear, then, that an award of fees under the
private attorney general doctrine is in the nature of damages; therefore,under Sierra Club, in order to award fees under the doctrine, a waiver of
sovereign immunity must exist.  See Sierra Club, 120 Hawai ‘i at 226, 202 P.3d 
at 1271. 
HRS § 661-1(1)(1993) provides, with emphasis added:
 
Jurisdiction. The several circuit courts of the State and,
except as otherwise provided by statute or rule, the several
 
12
 5     
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Taylor-Rice v. State, 105 Hawai‘ i 104, 110, 94 P.3d 659, 665 
(2004)(citation omitted).7 In Sierra Club, this court concluded
 
that HRS § 661-1 waived sovereign immunity on all claims founded
 
upon any statute, the statute in that case being HRS § 343-7
 (1993), which authorized judicial review of a state agency’s
 decisions concerning environmental assessments and environmental
 
impact statements. 120 Hawai‘ i at 226-28, 202 P.3d at 1271-73. 
This court stated, “Although the text of HRS § 343-7 does not
 
explicitly state that suits may be brought against the State,
 interpreting the text of [the subsections authorizing judicial
 review] as something other than a waiver of sovereign immunity
 
state district courts shall, subject to appeal as provided
by law, have original jurisdiction to hear and determine the
following matters, and, unless otherwise provided by law,
shall determine all questions of fact involved without the
intervention of a jury.
(1) All claims against the State founded upon any statute of the
State; or upon any regulation of an executive department; or upon any
contract, expressed or implied, with the State, and all claims which may
be referred to any such court by the legislature; provided that no
action shall be maintained, nor shall any process issue against the
State, based on any contract or any act of any state officer which the
officer is not authorized to make or do by the laws of the State, nor
upon any other cause of action than as herein set forth.
 
6 HRS Chapter 662 (1993) is the State Tort Liability Act, which is not at
 
issue in this appeal.
 
7 Since the passage of Act 395 in 1988, which created HRS Chapter 673,
 
also known as the Native Hawaiian Trust Judicial Relief Act, there are now at
least three statutory bases for the waiver of the State’s sovereign immunity: 
HRS Chapters 661, 662, and 673.  It appears Chapter 673 stands on equal
footing with Chapters 661 and 662.  See, e.g. , Mia Y. Teruya, The Native
Hawaiian Trusts Judicial Relief Act:  The First Step in an Attempt to Provide
 Relief, 14 U. H
AW. L. REV. 889, 905 (1992)(“This express waiver of [the
State’s] sovereign immunity [found in Chapter 673] is unique.  In the past,
the State has only allowed a waiver of sovereign immunity for tort and
contract actions against the state [pursuant to Chapters 662 and 661,
respectively].  No other state in the country allows itself to be sued for
breaches of its fiduciary duties.”)(footnotes omitted).
 
13
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
would create an absurd result.” 120 Hawai‘ i at 227, 202 P.3d at 
1272. The Sierra Club court then further held that, because the 
State consented to be sued, its liability is to be “judged under the same principles as those governing the liability of private 
parties.” 120 Hawai‘ i at 229, 202 P.3d at 1274 (citing Fought, 
87 Haw. at 56, 951 P.2d at 506). It concluded that the statutory 
waiver of immunity found in HRS §§ 661-1(1) and 343-7, coupled with the private attorney general doctrine, provided a basis for 
the award of attorneys’ fees to the plaintiffs. 120 Hawai‘ i at 
229, n.30, 202 P.3d at 1274, n.30. 
1. HRS § 661-1(1) and Chapter 632 
In this case, Plaintiffs parallel the analysis in Sierra 
Club (which drew heavily upon Fought, 87 Hawai‘ i 37, 951 P.2d 
487) to argue that HRS § 661-1(1)’s waiver of sovereign immunity 
applies, and that their claims were founded on statute, specifically HRS Chapter 632 (1993). For its part, the Dissent argues that “Plaintiffs here should not have to demonstrate a waiver of sovereign immunity specifically over attorneys’ fees,” citing Fought and Sierra Club’s extension of Fought. Concurrence/Dissent at II.A. We respectfully disagree with both the Plaintiffs and the Concurrence/Dissent because the instant case does not implicate HRS § 661-1 or any statutory waiver of sovereign immunity; rather, this case involves claims for 
14
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
declaratory and injunctive relief based on alleged constitutional
 
violations.
 
Fought held that “a further waiver of sovereign immunity is 
not necessary in order for HRS § 607-14 [a fee-shifting statute for “all actions in the nature of assumpsit”] to apply to the state and its respective agencies in matters which, by virtue of the express waiver of sovereign immunity set forth in HRS § 661­1, the state (or any of its agencies) has become a party.” 87 
Hawai‘i at 56, 951 P.2d at 506. Sierra Club then extended 
Fought’s holding that a further waiver of sovereign immunity was 
not necessary in order for the private attorney general doctrine to apply to the state, by virtue of the express waivers of sovereign immunity set forth in HRS §§ 661-1(1) and 343-7. 
Sierra Club, 120 Hawai‘ i at 229, 202 P.3d at 1274. 
However, Fought’s (and Sierra Club’s) holdings cannot be
 
extended to this case, because this case does not truly arise
 
under HRS § 661-1. Plaintiffs argue that their case fits under
 HRS § 661-1’s statutory waiver of sovereign immunity because 
their claims are “founded upon any statute of the State,” with
 the statute being HRS § 632-1, which authorizes declaratory and
 injunctive relief. We have already rejected this line of
 reasoning, however, as follows: “Where a party seeks only
 injunctive relief, the ability to sue the state does not stem
 
15
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
from a waiver of sovereign immunity, but from the fact that 
sovereign immunity does not bar the suit in the first place.” 
Sierra Club, 120 Hawai‘ i at 229 n.30, 202 P.3d at 1274 n.30. 
Therefore, “no clear statutory waiver . . . that could be 
extended to attorney’s fees” is present when the underlying claim is for declaratory and/or injunctive relief. Id. Moreover, we 
have also already held that declaratory and injunctive relief based on claims of constitutional violations is “not ‘cognizable 
under HRS chapter 661. . . .’” Kaho‘ohanohano, 114 Hawai‘ i at 
338, 162 P.3d at 732 (brackets omitted). Because Fought and 
Sierra Club would allow attorneys’ fees awards based upon waivers of sovereign immunity over the underlying claims, found in HRS § 661-1 and HRS §§ 607-14 and 343-7, respectively, these cases are of little assistance to the Plaintiffs and the Concurrence/Dissent. 
2. Chapter 673
 
Additionally, Plaintiffs argue that the State also waived 
its sovereign immunity pursuant to Chapter 673 (1993), the Native Hawaiian Trusts Judicial Relief Act. Chapter 673 governs claims 
of mismanagement of Home Lands Trust assets. It is true that 
Chapter 673 contains a clear general waiver of the State’s 
sovereign immunity, see Office of Hawaiian Affairs v. State, 110 
Hawai‘i 338, 358, 133 P.3d 767, 787 (2006)(“A plain reading of 
16
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
HRS § 673-1 indicates that it unequivocally waives the State’s
 
sovereign immunity” over breach of trust claims), HRS § 673-1(a)
 (“The State waives its immunity for any breach of trust or
 fiduciary duty resulting from the acts or omissions of its
 agents, officers and employees in the management and disposition
 of trust funds and resources of . . . [t]he Hawaiian home lands
 trust. . . .”). There is also a clear fee-shifting provision,
 which arguably could include attorneys’ fees under the private
 attorney general doctrine. See, e.g., HRS § 673-5(b)(1993)(“In
 
any action brought under this chapter in which there is no
 finding by the court that the claims pled were frivolous the
 court may, as it deems just, award to a prevailing plaintiff and
 enter as a part of its order or judgment, a reasonable sum for
 costs and expenses incurred, including reasonable attorney’s
 fees.”) Plaintiffs, however, did not bring their claims under
 Chapter 673 in their First Amended Complaint; Chapter 673 is not
 even mentioned. 
Although Plaintiffs’ allegations are about the Hawaiian Home
 
Lands Trust, they contend that the State failed to provide
 sufficient sums to DHHL in violation of its constitutional
 obligations under Article XII, §§ 1 and 2, and not in violation
 of Chapter 673. Plaintiffs allege that DHHL also violated the
 constitution and breached its fiduciary duties by failing to
 
17
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
request sufficient sums, that DHHL breached its fiduciary duties
 
by commercially leasing homestead lands in Kealakehe to a non-
Hawaiian entity, and that DHHL should be prohibited from
 commercially leasing homestead lands for non-homesteading
 purposes without first making specific findings that such lands
 are not needed for homesteads. Their claims against DHHL
 expressly sound in trust law, not Chapter 673. 
Although Plaintiffs do not allege that existing trust land
 
or assets were improperly managed or disposed of, they do allege
 that “sufficient sums” are constitutionally mandated to be added
 to the trust assets and the Defendants have breached
 constitutional and trust duties in failing to do so. From that
 perspective, Plaintiffs’ claims appear to fall under Chapter 673
 because they are about “breach of trust or fiduciary duty
 resulting from the acts or omissions of [the State’s] agents,
 officers and employees in the management and disposition of trust
 funds and resources of . . . [t]he Hawaiian home lands trust[.]” 
However, Plaintiffs did not assert Chapter 673 in their
 
First Amended Complaint. In addition, other provisions in
 Chapter 673 make it apparent that, while Plaintiffs generally
 allege breach of trust, their claims do not allege Chapter 673
 violations or seek Chapter 673 relief. First, the relief
 Plaintiffs request does not match the relief authorized under
 
18
   
 
   
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Chapter 673. In their First Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs’
 
requested only declaratory and injunctive relief, not damages
 (other than attorneys’ fees), and not a return of trust land or
 moneys, which is the only relief that Chapter 673 authorizes. 
See HRS § 673-4(a) (1993) (“In an action under this chapter the
 
court may only award land or monetary damages to restore the
 trust which has been depleted as a result of any breach of trust
 duty[,]” as well as some actual damages).

Second, there is no evidence in the record that Plaintiffs
 
complied with HRS § 673-3 (1993)’s notice and exhaustion of
 administrative remedies requirements, which are:
 
Before an action may be filed in circuit court under this
chapter, the party filing suit shall have exhausted all
administrative remedies available, and shall have given not
less than sixty days written notice prior to filing of the
suit that unless appropriate remedial action is taken suit
shall be filed.  All executive branch departments shall
adopt in accordance with chapter 91, such rules as may be
necessary to specify the procedures for exhausting any
remedies available. 
There is a process by which Plaintiffs could have exhausted their
 
administrative remedies. See, e.g., Hawai‘ i Administrative Rules 
Chapter 5, Title 10, Subchapter 3, Contested Case Rules. 
Failure to comply with HRS § 673-3 has proven fatal to
 
One law review article has interpreted Chapter 673 to exclude injunctive
 
relief.  See Eric K. Yamamoto, Moses Haia, and Donna Kalama, Courts and the
Cultural Performance:  Native Hawaiians’ Uncertain Federal and State Rights to
 Sue, 16 U. H
AW. L. REV. 1, 74 (1994)(“Most important, Chapter 673 limits
 
available remedies.  Suits may be initiated only to restore the trust corpus
depleted by the wrongful alienation or use of trust lands or funds, and to
recover actual out-of-pocket damages sustained by individual claimants. 
Chapter 673 does not authorize consequential damages, punitive damages, land
awards or injunctive relief.”)(footnotes omitted).

Chapter 673 breach of trust claims. In Office of Hawaiian 
Affairs, 110 Hawai‘ i at 359, 133 P.3d at 788, the only case 
construing Chapter 673, we held that plaintiffs must exhaust 
their administrative remedies and provide sixty days’ notice, pursuant to HRS § 673-3; absent fulfillment of these requirements, the circuit and appellate courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over the Chapter 673 claims. Plaintiffs’ claims were not brought under Chapter 673 because Chapter 673 is not mentioned in their First Amended Complaint, and there is nothing in the record about the exhaustion of administrative remedies and the notice given to the State Defendants. That being the case, the circuit court would have lacked jurisdiction to hear claims alleging Chapter 673 violations, and this court is “preclude[d] from reviewing any claims brought under Chapter 673,” including, presumably, claims for an award of attorneys’ fees pursuant to the private attorney general doctrine. Id. 
In short, it would appear, as Defendants argue, that
 
Plaintiffs’ after-the-fact reliance on Chapter 673 for a waiver
 of the State’s sovereign immunity is solely for the purpose of
 their attorneys’ fee request. Plaintiffs’ claims were not made
 under Chapter 673. 
20
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
3. Article XII
 
Rather, at their core, and as asserted in their First
 
Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs’ claims were about the Defendants’
 
violation of their constitutional duties under Article XII,
 
Section 1. In Kaho‘ohanohano , 114 Hawai‘ i at 338, 162 P.3d at 
732, this court considered claims based on the Hawai‘ i 
Constitution to be “not cognizable under HRS § 661” as “not
 
‘founded upon any statute of the State. . . .’” Thus, one must
 look to the true basis of Plaintiffs’ claim, Article XII, Section
 1, for a clear waiver of the State’s sovereign immunity, and
 there is none. Article XII, Section 1 provides:
 
Anything in this constitution to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920,
enacted by the Congress, as the same has been or may be
amended prior to the admission of the State, is hereby
adopted as a law of the State, subject to amendment or
repeal by the legislature;  provided that if and to the
extent that the United States shall so require, such law
shall be subject to amendment or repeal only with the
consent of the United States and in no other manner; 
provided further that if the United States shall have been
provided or shall provide that particular provisions or
types of provisions of such Act may be amended in the manner
required for ordinary state legislation, such provisions or
types of provisions may be so amended.  The proceeds and
income from Hawaiian home lands shall be used only in
accordance with the terms and spirit of such Act. The
 legislature shall make sufficient sums available for the
following purposes: (1) development of home, agriculture,
farm and ranch lots; (2) home, agriculture, aquaculture,
farm and ranch loans; (3) rehabilitation projects to
include, but not limited to, educational, economic,
political, social and cultural processes by which the
general welfare and conditions of native Hawaiians are
thereby improved; (4) the administration and operating
budget of the department of Hawaiian home lands; in
furtherance of (1), (2), (3) and (4) herein, by
appro
priating the same in the manner provided by law.
Thirty percent of the state receipts derived from the
leasing of cultivated sugarcane lands under any provision of
 
21
  
 
 There being no waiver of the State’s sovereign immunity
 
under Article XII, Section 1 for an award of attorneys’ fees, the
 
State’s sovereign immunity bars an award of appellate attorneys’
 fees to Plaintiffs based on the private attorney general
 doctrine, based on the record that exists at this juncture. 
The Dissent argues that “because Plaintiffs’ constitutional
 
claims in the underlying action did not implicate the State’s 
sovereign immunity, their claims for an award of attorneys’ fees
 under the private attorney general doctrine should not require a
 separate waiver of sovereign immunity.” Concurrence/Dissent at
 V. Implicit in this argument is an extension of Fought’s HRS §
 661-1 holding to cases involving constitutional violations. In
 support of this argument, the Dissent states, “A waiver of
 sovereign immunity separate from the underlying claim is not
 necessary under this court’s prior jurisprudence, . . . whether
 
the waiver is founded on statute, see Fought, 87 Hawai‘ i at 56, 
951 P.2d at 506, or the claim is founded on a constitutional
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
law or from water licenses shall be transferred to the
 
native Hawaiian rehabilitation fund, section 213 of the
Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920, for the purposes
enumerated in that section.  Thirty percent of the state
receipts derived from the leasing of lands cultivated as
sugarcane lands on the effective date of this section shall
continue to be so transferred to the native Hawaiian
 rehabilitation fund whenever such lands are sold, developed,
leased, utilized, transferred, set aside or otherwise
disposed of for purposes other than the cultivation of
sugarcane.  There shall be no ceiling established for the
aggregate amount transferred into the native Hawaiian
rehabilitation fund.

provision, see Kaho‘ ohanohano, 114 Hawai‘ i at 337, 163 P.3d at 
731.” Concurrence/Dissent at IV. 
Respectfully, this statement expands Fought’s holding too 
broadly and misapplies Kaho‘ ohanohano. Relevant to this case, 
Kaho‘ohanohano held only that sovereign immunity is no defense 
against a claim for declaratory and injunctive relief concerning 
an act of the legislature that allegedly violated the Hawai‘ i 
Constitution. Kaho‘ohanohano, 114 Hawai‘ i at 335-38, 162 P.3d at 
729-32. Attorneys’ fees were not at issue. Therefore, Kaho‘ohanohano does not stand for the proposition that if the 
underlying action is not barred by sovereign immunity, an 
entitlement to fees follows. 
In fact, we have already expressly rejected this argument on 
a motion for attorneys’ fees nearly indistinguishable from the instant one on the issue of sovereign immunity. In Taomae, as in this case, the plaintiffs prevailed on their claim that the state 
legislature’s action violated the Hawai‘ i Constitution. 110 
Hawai‘i at 332, 132 P.3d at 1243. The Taomae plaintiffs then 
requested attorneys’ fees, declaring (similarly to the 
Concurrence/Dissent) that “if sovereign immunity does not bar the underlying action, then no waiver is required for the imposition of fees and costs” pursuant to this court’s “inherent powers.” 
23
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
110 Hawai‘ i at 333, 132 P.3d at 1244. We rejected that argument, 
holding “simply because ‘sovereign immunity did not bar the 
instant contest,’” because the plaintiffs’ claim was for injunctive relief, “it cannot be assumed that an assessment of fees and costs is appropriate.” Id. We denied attorneys’ fees, 
concluding, “Plaintiffs have not demonstrated an entitlement to fees under Fought. And unlike in Fought, no statute authorizes a shift in fees. . . .” Id. Thus, contrary to the Dissent’s 
assertion in Concurrence/Dissent at II.A, this case is indistinguishable from Taomae. Even where the underlying suit for declaratory and injunctive relief for a constitutional violation is not precluded by sovereign immunity, there must exist some authorization for a shift in attorneys’ fees, as those are in the nature of damages. In this case, there is no such authorization. 
Kaho‘ohanohano also did not apply Fought’s HRS § 661-1 
holding to constitutional claims, and in fact, held that constitutional claims are not founded upon any statute and are 
therefore not cognizable under HRS § 661. 114 Hawai‘ i at 338, 
162 P.3d at 732. In short, there exists no authority entitling a 
prevailing party to attorneys’ fees under the private attorney general doctrine where sovereign immunity did not preclude an underlying declaratory and/or injunctive relief claim that the 
24
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
State violated the Hawai‘ i Constitution. 
D. Costs
 
HRAP Rule 39(d)(2012) requires parties requesting appellate
 
costs to “submit[] an itemized and verified bill of . . . costs,
 
. . . and, where appropriate, copies of invoices, bills,
 vouchers, and receipts. . . .” In this case, Plaintiffs filed an
 Exhibit A with their request for costs that did not include
 supporting documentation such as invoices, bills, vouchers, and
 
receipts. 
DHHL objected to the costs request as noncompliant with HRAP 
Rule 39. When an adverse party objects to the award of costs on 
the basis of noncompliance with HRAP Rule 39’s itemization and documentation requirements, this court may deny those costs. 
See, e.g., Rapozo v. Better Hearing of Hawai‘ i, LLC, 120 Hawai‘ i 
257, 264, 204 P.3d 476, 483 (2009). 
Plaintiffs then submitted with their Reply a corrected costs 
request, including copies of invoices, bills, vouchers, and 
receipts. Documented cost requests that are unchallenged by an adverse party can be granted without regard to their 
reasonableness. Blair v. Ing, 96 Hawai‘ i 327, 335, 31 P.3d 184, 
192 (2001). It would not be fair, however, to presume 
Plaintiffs’ costs to be reasonable, as neither the State nor DHHL has had an opportunity to challenge the reasonableness of 
25
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Plaintiffs’ costs, because they were itemized and documented for 
the first time in Plaintiffs’ Reply, and nothing in the Hawai‘ i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure allows the State or DHHL to file any 
response to a Reply. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ request for costs 
is denied without prejudice. See County of Hawai‘ i v. C & J 
Coupe Family Ltd. P’ship, 120 Hawai‘ i 400, 414-15, 208 P.3d 713, 
727-28 (2009)(“[W]aiting until the Errata to provide the 
appropriate support [for fees] leaves the [Appellee] without an opportunity to make specific objections to those items. Therefore, Appellant’s request for attorneys’ fees for preparation of the Request and the subsequent Response is denied.”) At the appropriate time upon remand, Plaintiffs may renew their request for appellate costs before the circuit court, which is in a position to award both trial and appellate costs. A properly documented appellate cost request will allow both the State and DHHL an opportunity to file any objections.

III. Conclusion
 
Plaintiffs’ request for appellate attorneys’ fees pursuant
 
to the private attorney general doctrine is denied as barred by
 
the doctrine of sovereign immunity, based on the record that
 exists at this juncture. Plaintiffs’ requests for appellate
 costs is denied without prejudice.
