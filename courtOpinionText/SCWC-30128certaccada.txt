AFFIRMING THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS’ JUDGMENT ON APPEAL
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.,
and Circuit Judge Ochiai, in place of Acoba, J., recused) 
On November 14, 2013, petitioner/defendant-appellant 
Raymond John Boots, Jr. (Raymond) filed an application for writ 
of certiorari seeking review of the September 16, 2013 judgment of the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA), including the ICA’s August 2, 2013 Order Denying Motion for Reconsideration, wherein the ICA denied Raymond’s request that it preserve his ability to raise an Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40 petition 
with regard to his ineffective assistance of counsel claims. 
Upon review of the application for writ to certiorari 
filed on November 14, 2013, by Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant Raymond John Boots, Jr., IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the application for a writ of
 
certiorari is accepted.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the September 16, 2013
 
judgment of the Intermediate Court of Appeals is affirmed in all
 
respects, except that the petitioner may file an HRPP Rule 40
 petition challenging the Family Court of the Third Circuit’s
 October 27, 2009 amended judgment on the grounds that he received
 ineffective assistance of counsel because (1) trial counsel did
 not cross-examine the complaining witness about her mental state
 on the day of the incident or because (2) trial counsel failed to
 call his other daughter to testify as a percipient witness.
