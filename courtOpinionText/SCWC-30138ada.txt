OPINION OF THE COURT BY ACOBA, J.
 
We hold that, although the Intermediate Court of
 
Appeals (ICA) held that the circuit court of the first circuit
 
1
(the court)  erred in admitting the testimony of Dr. Wayne Lee
(Dr. Lee), the physician who examined Complaining Witness (CW) #2

      ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
regarding alleged threats made by Respondent/Defendant-Appellant
 
John C. Veikoso (Respondent) against CW #2, the ICA committed
 grave error in concluding that the error was not harmless. See
 
State v. Veikoso, No. 30138, 2010 WL 5037006, at *16-17 (App.
 Dec. 9, 2010) (mem.). In our view, the error in admitting such
 testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly,
 we reverse the February 1, 2011 judgment of the ICA, filed
 pursuant to its December 9, 2010 Memorandum Opinion (memo op.),
2
 
insofar as it vacated the court’s September 28, 2009 Judgment
 convicting Respondent on Counts 4-8 (involving CW #2) and
 remanded those counts for a new trial.

On February 11, 2009, Respondent was charged by 
Petitioner/Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai' i (Petitioner) in an 
eight-count indictment with: (1) Sexual Assault in the First Degree, Hawai' i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-730(1)(a) (Supp. 
2009) (Counts 1 and 2 involving Complaining Witness (CW) #1 and Counts 4 (sexual penetration of penis into mouth) and 5 (sexual

penetration of penis into vagina) involving CW #2) ; (2) Sexual
2 The memo op. was filed by Presiding Judge Alexa D.J. Fujise and
 
Associate Judges Katherine G. Leonard and Lisa M. Ginoza.
 
3 Inasmuch as Respondent did not file an application for writ of
 
certiorari seeking review of the opinion of the ICA, the ICA’s judgment is
affirmed insofar as it affirmed the September 28, 2009 Judgment of the court
as to Respondent’s convictions on Counts 1-3.

events taking place on January 18, 2009, involving CW #1, and
 Counts 4 through 8 from events taking place on February 7, 2009
 involving CW #2. According to Petitioner, on separate occasions,
 Respondent solicited CW #1 and CW #2 respectively, who were
 working as prostitutes, from the same location, “drove both women
 over the Pali Highway--while threatening, terrifying, and beating
 them--to Maunawili Elementary School, where he sexually assaulted
 them in a similar manner at the same bench, after which he

II.
 
The following essential matters, some verbatim, are
 
from the record, the ICA opinion, and the submissions of the
 
parties.
 
The charges in the case were joined pursuant to Hawai' i 
Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 8 (2009), which permits the joinder of two or more offenses, with each offense stated in a separate count, when the offenses “(1) are of the same or similar character, even if not part of a single scheme or plan; or (2) are based on the same conduct or on a series of acts
 connected together or constituting parts of a single scheme or
 plan.” As discussed infra, Respondent filed a Motion for
 Severance of the Charges (Motion for Severance) arguing that he
 would be prejudiced by the joinder. Petitioner contended, inter
 alia, that Respondent would not be prejudiced by the joinder
 because the evidence supporting each offense would likely be
 admissible against Respondent, even if tried separately, to show
 intent, common scheme, plan, design or modus operandi. 
Respondent’s motion was denied by the court and the separate
 offenses involving CW #1 and CW #2 were joined in the same trial.
 
III.
 
A.
 
Opening Argument
 
At trial, defense counsel contended in his opening
 
argument that CW #2 consented to having sex with Respondent and
 “voluntarily went in[to Respondent’s] car, with the purpose of
 
4
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
making money.” He suggested that CW #2 had fabricated the
 
complaint against Respondent because “at some point . . . there
 was a dispute about the money being paid or not paid”; “there was
 an agreement for $120[,]” but the $120 “was found folded in
 [Respondent’s] pocket.” 
B.
 
CW #1’s Testimony
 
The incident pertaining to CW #1 is not at issue on
 
certiorari. See supra note 7. Petitioner contends that the
 
testimony of both complaining witnesses may be considered as part
 of the evidence to be weighed in CW #2’s case. Inasmuch as we
 conclude, for the reasons stated herein, that the evidence
 regarding CW #1 cannot be considered with the evidence regarding
 CW #2, CW #1’s testimony is not included herein.
 
C.
 
CW #2’s Testimony
 
CW #2 testified that in the early morning hours of
 
February 7, 2009, she was “down at Nuuanu [Avenue], behind [the
 stores] Pali Longs [and] Safeway,” when Respondent drove up in a
 Ford Mustang and asked her if she wanted to “cruise with him.” 
CW #2 agreed and voluntarily entered the vehicle. As Respondent
 drove over the Pali Highway, Respondent “kept saying, Oh I can
 take you back if you’re scared. . . . I can go get somebody else. 
If you want to go back, just tell me.” But CW #2 said, “I don’t
 mind. We can go hang out.” As Respondent turned into a dark
 neighborhood on Old Pali Road, he reiterated that he could take 
5
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
her back if she was scared. She finally said, “Okay, already.
 
. . . Just take me back[.]” Then, Respondent responded, “Oh,
 why? Are you scared of me now?” CW #2 reached for the phone
 “because [she] was scared”; Respondent grabbed it from her,
 struck her face and the back of her head several times, grabbed
 her hair, and pulled her down to the center console. CW #2 saw
 blood dripping from her face onto the console. She also
 indicated that when hit on the back of the head, she “blacked
 out[,]” but eventually regained consciousness. Respondent
 repeatedly told CW #2, “Shut the fuck up[,] . . . you’re going to
 do what I tell you to do[,]” while grabbing her by the hair and
 pulling her down. CW #2 thought she was going to die. 
When CW #2 attempted to escape, Respondent told her,
 
“Oh, try and get out[,]” but when CW #2 grabbed the door handle,
 he “grabbed [her] hair again” and said, “What the fuck are you
 doing?” When she tried to pull away from Respondent, he began to
 hit her on the back of the head with his fist or elbow. When she
 began screaming and pleading for Respondent to let her go,
 Respondent threatened, “Shut the fuck up or I’m going to shoot
 you.” (Emphasis added.) CW #2 finally yanked her hair free from
 Respondent’s hand and he said, “Oh, what the fuck are you doing? 
I’m going to crack you again.” After that, CW #2 remained quiet
 so that Respondent would not hurt her anymore. 
As they headed down the windward side of the Pali
 
Highway, Respondent told CW #2 that he would let her go at a
 nearby bus stop and give her money to catch the bus home. But as 
6
         
   
            
            
              
           
           
            
               
               
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
they passed the bus stop, Respondent continued to drive and
 
eventually turned into the Maunawili area. At some point, CW #2
 attempted to turn off Respondent’s ignition and Respondent said,
 “Look at what the fuck you did, bitch. . . . Oh, you want me to
 crack you again?” Respondent remarked, “The last girl that was
 with me got out, but she broke her collarbone.”
7
 
Respondent continued to drive through the dark stretch
 
of Maunawili and eventually turned into Maunawili Elementary
 School. As he pulled in, he said, “[Y]ou can tell your friends
 this is where you got fucked.” He pulled into a dark area near a
 dumpster and said, “[Y]ou’re going to do whatever I want you to
 do and then you can go; You’ll be fine if you do it.” Respondent
 then pulled CW #2 out of the vehicle by her hair and dragged her
 to a bench. 
At the bench, Respondent undressed, undressed CW #2,
 
put his penis “[i]nto her mouth” and forced CW #2 to perform oral
 sex on him. She did not scream because she “was scared
 [Respondent] was either going to hurt [her] or kill [her].” 
Thereafter, Respondent laid down and instructed CW #2 “to get on
 top of him.” She again complied, believing that “he was going to
 hit [her] again or kill [her].” Respondent “put his penis into 
7
 It is noted that the court orally instructed the jury it was to
 
consider CW #2’s allegation that Respondent “made a statement to her about the
 
last person to jump out of the car got a broken collarbone,” “only as evidence
 in this particular matter regarding [CW #2].” The court further instructed
 that “evidence regarding each matter is to be considered separately and used
only in the charges pertaining to a particular incident.” The court stated,
 “They don’t get in any way mixed up with each other. It can’t be considered
 in any other way than . . . in regards to this particular incident, with this
particular witness[.]”
 
7
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
[CW #2’s] vagina” and “made [her] suck his penis one more time.” 
Then, he made CW #2 lay down on the bench, kissed her, bit her
 lip, and spat inside her mouth as he placed “his hand . . . on
 [her] neck area” and “press[ed] down on . . . [her] throat”
 making it “hard to breathe.” Respondent also “touched [CW #2’s]
 breast, and then [] put his mouth on her breast.” He told CW #2
 that he was going to ejaculate “in [her] mouth” and she was
 “going to swallow it.” CW #2 “got on top of him one more time”;
 Respondent said, “Oh, get ready.” CW #2 “got off” of Respondent
 and Respondent “grabbed her neck[,]” “stuck his penis into her
 mouth and ejaculated”; he said, “Oh, you better swallow it.” 
After the incident, Respondent said, “I’ll give you
 
your cell phone back” if you “just come with me back to my car.” 
CW #2 told Respondent that she would meet him at the side of his
 car so he could give it to her. She started walking quickly
 toward the parking lot, but removed her shoes, and began running
 toward the highway. She attempted to flag down several cars
 until finally, Chad Ogawa (Ogawa) stopped. She ran up to his car
 and said, “Sir, Sir, please help me, please help me[.]” As they
 were driving, CW #2 saw that the Ford Mustang was still parked by
 the dumpster. Ogawa could not see the license plate number so he
 got out of the vehicle and walked towards the Ford Mustang. 
Ogawa returned to the vehicle with the license plate number and
 told CW #2 to save it in his cell phone.
 
Ogawa then drove CW #2 to a “7-Eleven” store to leave
 
her with one of his classmates, who “was going to call the cops.” 
8
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
After the police arrived, they took CW #2 to a residence where
 
she identified Respondent as her assailant and recognized the
 Ford Mustang by a sticker that was on the windshield. 
Ogawa’s Testimony
 
Ogawa testified that in early morning hours of
 
February 7, 2009, he was driving home from a nightclub, and as he
 drove past Maunawili Elementary School, CW #2 ran up to his car
 and asked him for help. CW #2 was “frantic”; her blouse was
 ripped and she had blood on her lip. She told Ogawa that “she
 just got raped at the school right across the street.” Ogawa
 told her to get in the car and as they started driving past the
 school, CW #2 said, “‘There he is.’” Ogawa got out of his car
 and started “sneaking up to [Respondent’s] car.” Ogawa took down
 the license plate number, and recorded it in his cell phone. 
Ogawa then drove to 7-Eleven, where an employee at the gas
 station called 911 and placed a report. Ogawa did not call the
 police himself because he had an outstanding traffic warrant. 
Dr. Lee’s Testimony
 
Petitioner’s expert witness, Dr. Lee, testified that on
 
February 7, 2009, he examined CW #2 at the Kapiolani Medical
 Center’s Sex Abuse Treatment Center for three hours. Dr. Lee
 testified that “[t]he purpose of [his] examination was to examine
 the patient for any injuries that might need medical attention
 and also to gather forensic evidence.” He explained that there
 are two parts to the exam: the first part is the historical exam
 to find out “the nature of your complaint and why you’re at the 
9
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
doctor’s office” and the second part of the exam is the physical
 
exam. 
During the historical exam, CW #2 complained of pain in
 
her upper lip, a bleeding nose, pain on the left side of her face
 and the back of her head, blood when she wiped after using the
 restroom, pain on her left arm, and marks on her right hip. When
 Dr. Lee asked her how the pain and bleeding started, she told him
 that her assailant punched her nose, causing it to bleed; punched
 her cheek and the back of her head, causing her to have a
 headache and ringing in her ears; grabbed her arm, causing pain;
 pulled her out of her car, causing pain on her right hip; punched
 her lips and left side of her face; pulled her hair; and bit her
 lip and left breast. CW #2 also told Dr. Lee that her assailant
 “put his penis in her vagina[,]” and that she was scared because
 he grabbed her throat, “made her massage his penis[,]” perform
 oral sex on him, rubbed her genital area, fondled her breast and
 entire body, kissed her breasts, spat in her mouth, and
 ejaculated in her mouth and forced her to swallow. CW #2 told
 Dr. Lee that “she did it” because she “was scared” and “[d]idn’t
 want to get hit again.” 
In addition, Dr. Lee testified that he asked CW #2 “if
 
there were any threats involved” and she said yes. (Emphasis
 added.) According to Dr. Lee, CW #2 told him that Respondent
 said “[she] wouldn’t be going home if [she] didn’t do what he
 told [her] to do.” (Emphasis added.) Dr. Lee further testified
 that CW #2 told him, “‘He said he would shoot me. He said I’d be 
10
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
lucky to go home today because most girls don’t go home[.]’” 
(Emphasis added.)
 
During the physical examination, Dr. Lee found that CW
 
#2 had “tenderness” to her breast; “recent abrasions or scratches
 on her ride side of her neck and her right thigh”; lesions on her
 neck; “tenderness” and “pain in her left shoulder and arm”; “a
 two-centimeter area” on the back of her neck “that was raised and
 tender,” “consistent with a hematoma” or “lump” or “a ‘goose
 egg[]’ on her scalp,” with “bleeding under the skin”; “a recent
 contusion”; a “red” and “swollen lip”; tenderness on the bridge
 of her nose; and multiple, recent contusions, bruises and
 abrasions on her body. According to Dr. Lee, CW #2 had pain, but
 no marks, on her right shoulder, at the bridge of her nose, and
 in the cheek bone area. 
In his pelvic examination, Dr. Lee observed some
 
redness on her external genitalia, indicating “that recently
 there was some irritation there.” Dr. Lee also discovered a
 loose black hair, which did not match CW #2's hair color. Id. 
Dr. Lee “noted that at the time of [his examination,] there was
 some scant pinkish vaginal discharge” and later in the
 examination he “saw it coming from the . . . opening of the
 cervix.” Dr. Lee “assumed that this was the beginning of a
 menstrual period for her” because “blood coming from the cervix
 is--you know, . . . a menstrual period.” When asked whether his
 bimanual examination was “consistent with penetration of the
 genital opening[,]” Dr. Lee responded, “Yes, it was.” Although 
11
         
 
  
 
        
          
        
         
          
       
           
            
        
       
          
              
           
          
              
           
       
        
    
         
         
   
 
   
     
     
       
     
      
     
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
he indicated that the bimanual examination, during which he
 
places “fingers inside of her vagina[,]” “was unremarkable,”
 “normal,” Dr. Lee was asked on redirect examination, “[T]he fact
 that you don’t see injuries to the genital area, does that rule
 out a sexual assault?” He responded, “No, It does not.”
8
 
At the close of Dr. Lee’s testimony, defense counsel
 
moved to strike Dr. Lee’s testimony regarding statements that CW
 #2 was assaulted and threatened by Respondent, arguing that such
 testimony has “nothing to do with a physical examination.” The
 following exchange took place:
 
THE  COURT:   Under  803(b)(4) [ 9
]  statements for purposes
of 
medical diagnosis, the doctor has to do a thorough
diagnosis; and based on the diagnosis, it’s going to lead to
the appropriate treatment. So finding out, for instance,
whether an assault takes place or takes place with a
stranger or intimate family member is going to have to do
with the doctor’s treatment recommendations on staying away
from people, being close to people. Her talking about it in
her history of talking about it is an integral part of that.
And the treatment he may order may include psychological
counseling, may include post-traumatic stress disorder, if
 
8 On appeal, Respondent argued that the court erred in allowing Dr.
 
Lee to opine that his findings did not rule out sexual assault where there was
no physical evidence to support his opinion. According to Respondent, this
 was error because “the testimony had the improper prejudicial effect of
bolstering CW # 2’s credibility.” Veikoso , 2010 WL 5037006, at *11. The ICA
 
rejected the argument, reasoning that Dr. Lee “testified that his findings did
 not ‘rule out’ sexual assault.” Id.
 
9	 Hawai'i Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 803(b)(4) (1993) provides: 
Hearsay exceptions; availability of declarant
immaterial. The following are not excluded by the hearsay
rule, even though the declarant is available as a witness:
 
. . . .
 (b) Other exceptions.
 
. . . .
 (4)	 Statements made for purposes of medical
diagnosis or treatment and describing medical
history, or past or present symptoms, pain, or
sensations, or the inception or general
character of the cause or external source
 thereof insofar as reasonably pertinent to
diagnosis or treatment.
 
12
         
           
            
  
         
      
    
         
         
         
         
        
         
           
      
    
           
         
        
          
           
    ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
appropriate; and the only way that can come about is to get
the history from her. So the objection is noted, but it is
overruled under 803(b)(4).
And because [CW #2] is present, she’s going to be
available for cross-examination so there’s no confrontation
 clause issue at this time.
 
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I’d just like to point out, [Y]our
[H]onor, that the purpose of this examination was not for
purposes of diagnosis and treatment. The purpose of this
examination was for--it’s a sex assault examination. So I
 don’t believe the doctor even testified as to what
 treatment, if anything, he was going to recommend. By
allowing this doctor to testify as to what [CW #2] may have
said will bolster--unnecessarily bolster the testimony of
[CW #2] in this case.
THE COURT: Okay. I think it’s for both. The
 
doctor’s examination is to look for evidence of sex assault
 trauma, if that’s what really happened; but her statements
to him are for both diagnosis and treatment and referral.
So I think it’s for all of those purposes. So your
 objection is noted and overruled.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
Testimony of Cathy Matsuoka
 
Cathy Matsuoka (Matsuoka) testified that as to evidence
 
relating to CW #2, she examined dried secretion swabs, a blood
 sample, vaginal swabs, pubic hair combings collected from CW #2,
 four swab samples with blood-like substances collected from a
 Ford Mustang, and a pair of jean shorts recovered from
 Respondent. Matsuoka indicated that the samples were collected
 from “the back cup holder on the driver’s side[,]” “the back cup
 holder on the passenger side[,]” “the front cup holder on the
 passenger side[,]” and the “middle storage compartment” of
 Respondent’s vehicle. All swab samples collected from the Ford
 Mustang were determined to be human blood and matched the DNA
 profile of CW #2. Matsuoka also detected human blood on
 Respondent’s jean shorts and determined that the DNA profile of
 the blood matched CW #2’s DNA profile. As to CW #2’s vaginal
 swabs, semen was indicated, but no male DNA was present in that 
13
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
particular sample. The DNA profile of the dried secretion swab
 
excluded Respondent as a possible contributor. 
Closing Argument
 
Respondent did not testify at trial. During closing
 
argument, defense counsel again argued that CW #2 had consented
 to having sex with Respondent, and that this was a case of
 Respondent “not having money to pay for sex.” According to the
 defense, after “taking the 120 dollars, [] there was a
 disagreement.” 
D.
 
Jury Verdict and Sentencing 
On July 29, 2009, the jury found Respondent guilty on
 
all eight counts. On September 28, 2009, the court sentenced
 Respondent.
 
IV.
 
On October 28, 2009, Respondent filed a notice of
 
appeal. Relevant to our disposition, Respondent argued on appeal
 that the court erred in admitting Dr. Lee’s testimony regarding
 Respondent’s threats and opinions regarding the lack of forensic
 evidence. The ICA rejected all of Respondent’s other arguments,
 but determined that the court erred in admitting Dr. Lee’s
 testimony regarding alleged threats made by Respondent against CW
 #2 and that such error was not harmless beyond a reasonable
 doubt. 
A.
 
In support of its conclusion that the court erred in
 
admitting Dr. Lee’s testimony regarding threats, the ICA noted
 
14
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
that Hawai' i courts have not fully developed the reach of HRE 
Rule 803(b)(4) as to the admissibility of threats. It was noted 
that “[o]ther courts generally admit hearsay statements describing the physical nature of the assault, as such statements pertain to the “cause or external source of the injuries.” Veikoso, 2010 WL 5037006, at *12 (citing Guam v. Ignacio, 10 F.3d 608, 613 (9th Cir. 1993)). The ICA concluded that “Dr. Lee’s testimony regarding CW # 2’s description of the physical aspects of the assault was admissible under this reasoning.” Id. 
However, the ICA stated that as to statements regarding
 
fault, “courts have tended to adopt either a broad or narrow
 interpretation of this hearsay exception.” Id. “Under the
 
narrower interpretation, courts will not admit hearsay statements
 pertaining to fault[,] . . . including those regarding the
 identity of the assailant[.]” Id. “Under the broader
 
interpretation, courts appear to be more willing to admit hearsay
 statements assigning fault,” and in the child abuse context,
 statements relating to the assailant’s identity. Id. It was
 
noted that “[s]everal jurisdictions have extended this reasoning
 to domestic assault complainants, as their ongoing safety and
 psychological treatment depends on the identity of the abuser.” 
Id.
 
According to the ICA, however, “even courts employing
 
the broad interpretation generally do not admit statements
 describing alleged threats the defendant made to the
 complainant.” Id. The ICA stated that although only “[a]
 
handful of cases have dealt with the type of hearsay at issue in 
15
          
            
             
         
         
           ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
this case--alleged threats of the assailant[--t]he overwhelming
 
majority have held the threats inadmissible” as unrelated to
 medical diagnosis or treatment. Id. at *13. The ICA adopted the
 
majority view, determining that Dr. Lee’s testimony regarding
 alleged threats was inadmissible because “there is no testimony
 linking [Respondent]’s alleged threats to the cause or inception
 of CW # 2’s injuries.” Id. The ICA acknowledged that this court
 
has held that HRE 803(b)(4) “extends to statements made for the
 purpose of psychological treatment.” Id. at *14 (citations
 
omitted).
10 According to the ICA, although “alleged threats
 
could arguably be admissible if conveyed for the purpose of
 psychological diagnosis or treatment, no such foundation was laid
 here.” Id. In accordance with the foregoing, the ICA held that
 
the court erred in admitting the testimony under HRE Rule
 803(b)(4). Id. at *15.
 
B.
 
The ICA then proceeded to consider whether the court’s
 
error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and held that it was
 not. See id. According to the ICA, “in adult sexual assault
 
cases, the credibility of the complainant is paramount[]” and
 where, as in this case, the defendant raises a defense of
 consent, the complaining witness is “critical . . . as he or she
 is often the sole eyewitness to what occurred.” Id. It was

 The ICA cited to State v. Yamada , 99 Hawai 'i 542, 546-47, 556, 57 
P.3d 467, 471-72, 481 (2002), where this “court held that a videotape of the 
defendant’s ‘reenactment’ of the events giving rise to prosecution wasadmissible because the reenactment was conducted to aid the treatingpsychologist in making a diagnosis.” Veikoso , 2010 WL 5037006, at *14. 
16
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
noted that Respondent “attempted to cast doubt upon CW # 2’s
 
credibility on several bases” including,
 
her  failure  to  disclose  to  the  [g]rand  [j]ury  that  she  was
working  as  a  prostitute;  her  failure  to  disclose  until  the
week  of  trial  that  she  had  sex  for  a  fee  with  another  man
 
earlier  that  same  night;  her  failure  to  report  the  incident
immediately  after  it  happened;  and  discrepancies  with  her
[g]rand  [j]ury  testimony.
 
Id. 
While acknowledging that Petitioner “presented limited
 
corroborating evidence from Dr. Lee and Ogawa,” the ICA found it
 significant that “the statement concerning alleged threats went
 to the heart of the key witness’s testimony[,]” was “not
 cumulative to other evidence[,]” and “[s]everal of the most
 damaging statements were conveyed solely through Dr. Lee’s
 hearsay testimony.” Id. The ICA noted that, for example,
 
“CW # 2 never testified that [Respondent] told her ‘she’d be
 lucky to go home today’” or that Respondent had allegedly
 remarked that “‘most girls don’t go home.’” Id. (brackets
 
omitted). Thus, according to the ICA, “[t]he jury was [] allowed
 to consider evidence it should not have heard[]” and “[t]he
 threats to which CW # 2 did testify arguably were colored with
 heightened credibility as a result of Dr. Lee’s improper
 testimony.” Id. In the ICA’s view, “[t]he alleged threats,
 
relayed in raw terms as vivid and concrete quotations and
 repeated several times, may have tipped the scale in favor of
 CW # 2’s credibility.” Id. It therefore concluded “that there
 
is a reasonable possibility that the error might have contributed
 to the conviction and we cannot conclude that the error was 
17
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id. The ICA’s conclusion
 
ultimately led to the filing of Petitioner’s Application, which
 
poses the only question before this court. 
V.
 
Petitioner’s Application filed on May 2, 2011, sets
 
forth the following question: “In light of the overwhelming
 evidence of [Respondent’s] sexual assaults and kidnapping
 convictions involving CW #2, did the ICA err gravely in vacating
 and remanding Counts 4 through 8 for a new trial on account of
 Dr. Lee’s testimony concerning CW #2’s report of the threats
 [Respondent] made against her?” Respondent filed a Response to
 Petitioner’s Application on May 17, 2011 (Response).
 
VI.
 
A.
 
Petitioner does not challenge, but agrees with the
 
ICA’s conclusion that the court erred in admitting Dr. Lee’s
 testimony regarding alleged threats made by Respondent against CW
 #2 under HRE Rule 803(b)(4). Petitioner states that it “has no
 quarrel with the ICA” as to its conclusion that the court “erred
 in admitting” “Dr Lee’s testimony regarding CW #2’s report of
 [Respondent’s] threats” “under HRS Rule 803(b)(4)” where “Dr. Lee
 did not explain the connection between the threats and the
 necessity of any treatment, psychological or otherwise.” 
However, Petitioner disagrees “with the ICA’s ruling that the
 error below was not harmless.” 
Citing State v. Machado, 109 Hawai' i 445, 453-56, 127 
P.3d 941, 949-52 (2006), Petitioner contends that “there was no 
18         
           
          
         
   
           
      
            
          
          
 
     
        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
reasonable possibility that the error contributed to
 
[Respondent]’s conviction.” According to Petitioner, in Machado,
 the trial court admitted as an excited utterance a police
 sergeant’s testimony regarding statements made to him by the
 complainant upon arriving at her home. (Citing id. at 448-49,
 127 P.3d at 944-45.) As Petitioner noted, this court determined
 that although the circuit court erred in admitting the testimony
 as an excited utterance, the error was harmless in light of the
 entire record because even in the absence of the improper
 testimony, “the [complainant’s] testimony and her 911 call[ 
11
 ]
established the elements of the . . . charges beyond a reasonable
 doubt[.]” 
(Citing id.
 at 453-56, 127 P.3d at 949-52.)
 
Petitioner maintains that, in contrast to Machado, the
 
ICA “examined the error in isolation and purely in the
 abstract[,]” “fail[ing] to balance the error against the
 overwhelming, compelling evidence” supporting Respondent’s
 convictions. First, Petitioner notes that the instant case did
 not “present the typical ‘he said, she said’ credibility battle
 between the victim and the accused” since Respondent “never
 
11 The complainant had placed a call to the police, which was played
 
for the jury. The 911 call included the following statements:
 
1.	 “Please hurry up he’s going to kill me, please hurry”
 
2.	 “My boyfriend Dennis Machado”
 
3.	 “He choked me and he, he tried to stab me with a
knife, please help me, please help me”
 
4.	 “He choked me and he, he choked and he held me on the
ground and stepped on my head, he pinned me down and
tried to stab me, and he slammed me into the wall,
please, please”
 
5.	 “Somebody’s here, the police are here”
 
Machado , 109 Hawai 'i at 448, 127 P.3d at 944. 
19
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
testified, and indeed, presented no evidence on his behalf at
 
trial.” Thus, Petitioner avers that, because there was nothing
 indicating that CW #2 was not credible, CW #2’s “testimony alone
 evinced beyond a reasonable doubt that [Respondent] kidnapped her
 with intent to subject her to sexual advance [and] terrorize her”
 and that Respondent “sexually assaulted her on at least four
 occasions by strong compulsion” and had other “sexual contact
 with her by strong compulsion.” 
Additionally, Petitioner points out that the scientific
 
evidence proved that “CW #2’s blood was in [Respondent’s] Mustang
 and on his shorts.” According to Petitioner, such evidence
 objectively establishes that Respondent’s sexual contact with CW
 #2 was not consensual. In Petitioner’s view, the evidence was
 also overwhelming because of the testimony of both complaining
 witnesses. Based on the foregoing, Petitioner contends that
 “[i]t is inconceivable that Dr. Lee’s testimony . . . might have
 had anything to do with [Respondent’s] convictions in light of
 the entire record.” 
B.
 
Respondent’s Response states that Petitioner fails to
 
point to overwhelming, compelling evidence supporting
 Respondent’s convictions. First, Respondent notes that “adult
 sexual cases are often credibility contests” and here, CW #2’s
 credibility was called into question on several different
 grounds, including her “failure to inform the [g]rand [j]ury that
 she was working as a prostitute, her eve-of-trial disclosure that 
20
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
she engaged in sex for a fee the same night as her encounter with
 
[Respondent], and other discrepancies between her testimony and
 other accounts she gave under oath.” Thus, Respondent contends
 that CW #2’s “testimony alone does not constitute ‘overwhelming,
 compelling evidence’ that would render the [] court’s error
 harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.” 
Next, as to the presence of CW #2’s blood in
 
Respondent’s Mustang and on his shorts, Respondent contends that
 such presence “can be interpreted in many different ways” and
 “absolutely does not offer ‘objective’ conclusions of any kind,
 especially in light of Dr. Lee’s testimony that CW #2 was
 starting her menstrual period.” 
Also, Respondent maintains that the evidence of both
 
complaining witnesses cannot be considered together. According
 to Respondent, although the ICA stated that the evidence would
 likely have been admissible against Respondent if the cases had
 been tried separately to show modus operandi or identity, such
 evidence would not be admissible to prove Respondent’s guilt. In
 addition, Respondent notes that the jury received a cautionary
 instruction prohibiting it from considering the evidence in such
 a manner.
 
Finally, Respondent argues that although Petitioner
 
focuses on the ICA’s conclusion that “Dr. Lee’s testimony ‘may
 have tipped the scale in favor of CW #2’s credibility,’” (quoting
 Veikoso, 2010 WL 5037006, at *8), Petitioner “ignores the ICA’s 
21
         
      
       
           
        
       
           
        
     
          
        
          
           
         
         
            
         
       
  
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
thorough analysis of all the evidence[.]” Respondent points to
 
the following passage in support of the foregoing contention:
 
“The hearsay testimony was highly prejudicial to
[Respondent]. The alleged threats were repeated several
times and were presented as CW # 2’s own words. Moreover,
in adult sexual assault cases, the credibility of the
complainant is paramount. The complaining witness is
critical to establishing a lack of consent, as he or she is
often the sole eyewitness to what occurred. Although
[Petitioner] presented limited corroborating evidence from
Dr. Lee and Ogawa, CW # 2’s credibility was still critical
to establishing all five counts. [Respondent] argued a
defense of consent in his closing argument. He attempted to
cast doubt upon CW # 2’s credibility on several bases: her
 failure to disclose to the [g]rand [j]ury that she was
working as a prostitute; her failure to disclose until the
week of trial that she had sex for a fee with another man
 earlier that same night; her failure to report the incident
immediately after it happened; and discrepancies with her
[g]rand [j]ury testimony.”
 
(Quoting Veikoso, 2010 WL 5037006, at *15.)
 
VII.
 “Regarding the erroneous admission of evidence by a
 
trial court, this court has said that[, e]ven if the trial court
 
erred in admitting evidence, a defendant’s conviction will not be
 overturned if the error was harmless beyond a reasonable
 doubt[.]” Machado, 109 Hawai' i at 452, 127 P.3d at 948 (internal 
quotation marks and citation omitted). Under this standard,
 “[t]he error is not to be viewed in isolation and considered
 purely in the abstract.” Id. (internal quotation marks and
 
citation omitted). Rather, the error “must be examined in the
 light of the entire proceedings and given the effect which the
 whole record shows it to be entitled. In that context, the real
 question becomes whether there is a reasonable possibility that
 error might have contributed to conviction.” Id. at 452-53, 127
 
P.3d at 948-49 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
22
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
VIII.
 
With respect to assessing whether the erroneous 
admission of evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, 
this court has stated that the “[m]ere sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury verdict, apart from that aspect of the case affected by the error, would not be enough.” State v. 
Pokini, 57 Haw. 26, 30, 548 P.2d 1402, 1405 (1976). However, Petitioner is correct that this court had held that “‘[w]here there is a wealth of overwhelming and compelling evidence tending to show the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, errors in the admission or exclusion of evidence are deemed harmless.’” State v. Toyomura, 80 Hawai' i 8, 27, 904 P.2d 893, 912 (1995) 
(quoting State v. Nakamura, 65 Haw. 74, 80, 648 P.2d 183, 187 (1982)); accord State v. Rivera, 62 Haw. 120, 128, 612 P.2d 526, 532 (1980). 
IX.
 
We first consider whether CW #1’s testimony may be
 
weighed in assessing whether there was overwhelming and
 compelling evidence tending to show Respondent was guilty of
 Counts 4-8 beyond a reasonable doubt. As indicated, the offenses
 involving CW #1 and CW #2 were joined pursuant to HRPP Rule 8. 
Respondent filed his Motion for Severance on May 6, 2009, arguing
 that he would be prejudiced by the joinder of offenses. On
 May 11, 2009, Petitioner filed its Memorandum in Opposition to
 Respondent’s Motion for Severance, maintaining that the defendant
 seeking severance has the burden of showing prejudice would
 result from joinder of the offenses. 
23
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Petitioner noted that one instance in which joinder may
 
deny a defendant a fair trial is where evidence damaging to the
 
defendant would not have been admissible if the offenses had been
 tried separately. Petitioner contended that here (1) the
 evidence supporting CW #1 would be admissible against Respondent
 as to counts involving CW #2 to show intent, common scheme, plan,
 design or modus operandi and (2) although consolidated trials
 will almost always permit the admission of some evidence that
 would not be admissible as to each and every count if tried
 separately, any potential prejudice may be effectively dispelled
 by a jury instruction that each count and the evidence that
 applies to each count is to be considered separately. The court
 denied Respondent’s Motion for Severance on June 4, 2009. 
On appeal, Respondent argued that he was prejudiced by
 
the joinder. In considering the foregoing argument, the ICA
 stated that Respondent was not prejudiced by inadmissable
 evidence because the evidence of the incident involving CW #1
 “would likely have been admissible to show modus operandi and
 identity” because the “two incidents are so ‘strikingly similar
 . . . as to support the inference that both were the handiwork of
 the very same person.’” Veikoso, 2010 WL 5037006, at *8 (quoting
 
Commentary to HRE Rule 404). However, the ICA was incorrect. 
Here, the testimony of CW #1 would not be admissible to
 
prove identity because identity was not disputed. Rather,
 Respondent raised a defense of consent and suggested that CW #2
 had fabricated the complaint because “at some point[,] . . . 
24
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
there was a dispute about the money being paid or not paid”;
 
“there was an agreement for $120[,]” but the $120 “was found
 folded in [Respondent’s] pocket.” See supra. According to
 
Respondent, this was a case of Respondent “not having money to
 pay for sex.” Thus, the testimony of CW #1 was not admissible
 against Respondent as to Counts 4-8 to show identity.
 
Furthermore, this court has explained that modus
 
operandi evidence ultimately goes to identity and consequently,
 where “the identity of the perpetrator of the crimes [is] not
 denied, [] the admission of the other crimes evidence as proof of
 modus operandi cannot be justified[.]” State v. Castro, 69 Haw.
 
633, 645, 756 P.2d 1033, 1042 (1988); see People v. Boyd, 851
 N.E.2d 827, 836 (Ill. App. Ct. 2006) (stating that “[m]odus
 operandi evidence ordinarily is not relevant where identity is
 not at issue”; because “the defense theory was consent, the
 identity of the offender was not at issue” and “[m]odus operandi
 would not have been a relevant basis to admit the other crimes
 evidence”); Rosky v. State, 111 P.3d 690, 698 (Nev. 2005)
 (stating that “[g]enerally, modus operandi evidence is proper in
 situations where a positive identification of the perpetrator has
 not been made, and the offered evidence establishes a signature
 crime so clear as to establish the identity of the person on
 trial”) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Again,
 because identity was not in dispute in this case, CW #1’s
 testimony was not admissible against Respondent as to charges
 involving CW #2 to show modus operandi. Nevertheless, excluding

   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
CW #1’s testimony, there was overwhelming evidence presented
 
tending to show that Respondent was guilty of Counts 4-8 beyond a
 reasonable doubt.
12
 
X.
 A.
 
As noted supra, Respondent was charged with two counts
 
of Sexual Assault in the First Degree. As to Count 4, the jury
 was instructed that the offense of Sexual Assault in the First
 Degree has three material elements: (1) Respondent subjected CW
 
13
 #2 to an act of sexual penetration  by inserting his penis into
12 Although the jury heard CW #1’s testimony, here, the court
 
instructed the jury that it was to consider the evidence that applies to each
count separately. At the close of trial, the court instructed the jury as
 follows:
 
The defendant is charged with more than one offense under
separate counts in the indictment. Each count and the
 evidence that applies to that count is to be considered
separately. The fact that you may find the defendant not
guilty, or guilty of one of the counts charged, does not
mean that you must reach the same verdict with respect to
any other count charged.
 
Thus, we may presume that the jury did not consider CW #1’s testimony inreaching its verdict as to Counts 4-8. See State v. Webster , 94 Hawai 'i 241,
248-49, 11 P.3d 466, 473-74 (2000) (“A jury is presumed to follow the court’sinstructions.” (Quoting State v. Cardus , 86 Hawai 'i 426, 438, 949 P.2d 1047, 
1059 (App. 1997).)). 
13 HRS § 707-700 (Supp. 2009) defines “sexual penetration” as
 
follows:
 
“Sexual penetration” means:
 (1)	 Vaginal intercourse, anal intercourse, fellatio,
deviate sexual intercourse, or any intrusion of
any part of a person’s body or of any object
into the genital or anal opening of another
person’s body; it occurs upon any penetration,
however slight, but emission is not required.
As used in this definition, “genital opening”
includes the anterior surface of the vulva or
 labia majora; or
 
(2)	 Cunnilingus or anilingus, whether or not actual
penetration has occurred.

        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
14	 and (3) did so knowingly her mouth, (2) by strong compulsion,  1
5
 
as to each element of the offense. As to Count 5, the jury was
 
instructed that the elements of Sexual Assault in the First
 Degree were: (1) Respondent subjected CW #2 to an act of sexual
 penetration by inserting his penis into her genital opening,
 (2) by strong compulsion, and (3) did so knowingly as to each
 element of the offense. 
1.
 
As to the element of “sexual penetration” under Count
 
4, CW #2 testified that Respondent put his penis “[i]nto [her]
 mouth” and forced her to perform oral sex on him. She further
 testified that after forcing her to have vaginal sex, Respondent
 “made [her] suck his penis one more time.” 
Then, according to CW
 
#2, Respondent told her that he was going to ejaculate “in [her]
 mouth[,]” “stuck his penis into her mouth[,] ejaculated[,]” and
 said, “[Y]ou better swallow it.” CW #2’s testimony was
 
14	 HRS § 707-700 (1993) defines “strong compulsion” as follows:
 
“Strong compulsion” means the use of or attempt to use
one or more of the following to overcome a person:
(1)	 A threat, express or implied, that places a
person in fear of bodily injury to the
individual or another person, or in fear that
the person or another person will be kidnapped;
 
(2)	 A dangerous instrument; or
 
(3)	 Physical force .
 
(Emphases added.)
 
HRS § 702-206(2) (1993) defines “knowingly” as follows:
 
(a)	 A person acts knowingly with respect to his conduct
when he is aware that his conduct is of that nature.
 
(b)	 A person acts knowingly with respect to attendant
circumstances when he is aware that such circumstances
 
exist.
 
(c)	 A person acts knowingly with respect to a result of
his conduct when he is aware that it is practically
certain that his conduct will cause such a result.
 
27
 15         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
corroborated by Dr. Lee’s testimony that CW #2 told him during
 
her physical examination that her assailant made her perform oral
 sex on him, ejaculated in her mouth, and made her swallow. 
As to the element of “sexual penetration” under
 
Count 5, CW #2 testified that Respondent “put his penis into
 [her] vagina[.]” The foregoing testimony was corroborated in
 this case by Dr. Lee’s testimony that CW #2 related to him during
 her physical examination that her assailant “put his penis in her
 vagina.” Dr. Lee also indicated that his bimanual examination
 was “consistent with penetration of the genital opening.” In
 addition, according to the testimony of Ogawa, when CW #2 ran up
 to his car, her blouse was ripped and she told him immediately
 upon entering his vehicle that “she just got raped at the school
 right across the street.” 
2.
 
As to the element of “strong compulsion” under both
 
Counts 4 and 5, there was evidence that Respondent used both
 “threat[s],” plac[ing] [CW #2] in fear of bodily injury” or “in
 fear that [she would] . . . be kidnapped[,]” and “physical force”
 “to overcome CW #2.” HRS § 707-700. As to threats, CW #2
 testified that Respondent repeatedly told her, “Shut the fuck
 up[,] . . . you’re going to do what I tell you to do”; when she
 started screaming, Respondent threatened, “Shut the fuck up or
 I’m going to shoot you”; when Respondent grabbed CW #2’s hair
 after she grabbed the handle of Respondent’s vehicle, CW #2
 pulled free and Respondent said, “Oh, what the fuck are you
 doing? I’m going to crack you again”; while driving, CW #2
 
28
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
turned off Respondent’s ignition and Respondent said, “Look at
 
what the fuck you did, bitch. . . . Oh, you want me to crack you
 again?”; at some point after she had attempted to escape from his
 vehicle, Respondent told CW #2 that “[t]he last girl that was
 with [him] got out, but she broke her collarbone”; upon arriving
 at Maunawili Elementary School, Respondent warned, “[Y]ou’re
 going to do whatever I want you to do and then you can go; You’ll
 be fine if you do it.” 
There was also evidence that Respondent used
 
“[p]hysical force” to overcome CW #2. CW #2 testified that
 Respondent struck her in the face and the back of the head
 several times, grabbed her hair, and pulled her down to the
 center console, causing her to bleed and “black[] out.” She
 stated that when she attempted to free her hair from Respondent’s
 hands, he hit her on the back of the head with his fist or elbow. 
Once at the school, Respondent dragged her by the hair to a bench
 before demanding her to perform oral and vaginal sex. He then
 placed his hands on her neck and pressed down on her throat,
 making it difficult for her to breathe, and ejaculated in her
 mouth. 
CW #2’s testimony regarding the physical force used by
 
Respondent against her was corroborated by Dr. Lee’s testimony. 
As recounted, Dr. Lee testified that CW #2 related to him that
 her assailant punched her nose, causing it bleed; punched her
 cheek and the back of her head, causing her to have a headache
 and ringing in her ears; grabbed her arm, causing pain; pulled
 her out of her car, causing pain on her right hip; punched her
 
29
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
lips and left side of her face; pulled her hair; and bit her lip
 
and left breast. 
Dr. Lee further testified that during his physical
 
examination of CW #2, he observed “tenderness” in her breast;
 “recent abrasions or scratches on her ride side of her neck and
 her right thigh”; lesions on her neck; “tenderness” and “pain in
 her left shoulder and arm”; “a two-centimeter area” on the back
 of her neck “that was raised and tender,” “consistent with a
 hematoma” or “lump” or “a goose egg[] on her scalp,” with
 “bleeding under the skin”; “a recent contusion”; a “red” and
 “swollen lip”; tenderness on the bridge of her nose; and
 multiple, recent contusions, bruises and abrasions on her body. 
CW #2’s testimony regarding Respondent’s use of physical force
 against her was also corroborated by Ogawa’s testimony that CW #2
 had blood on her lip when she ran up to his car and asked for
 help. 
In addition, the physical evidence presented in this
 
case confirmed that CW #2’s blood was in Respondent’s vehicle and
 on his shorts, further corroborating CW #2’s testimony.
 Respondent contends that the physical evidence does not offer
 “‘objective’ conclusions of any kind, especially in light of Dr.
 Lee’s testimony that CW #2 was starting her menstrual period.” 
However, it is significant that Matsuoka testified the blood was
 discovered on the “middle compartment” and “cup holder” of
 Respondent’s vehicle, which corroborates CW #2’s testimony that
 Respondent pulled her down to the center console, causing her to
 bleed. 
30
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Finally, there was evidence that Respondent’s threats
 
and force was sufficient to overcome CW #2. According to CW #2’s
 
testimony, she did not scream and complied with Respondent’s
 demands because she was “scared [he] was going to hit [her] [] or
 kill [her].” CW #2’s testimony in that regard was corroborated
 by Dr. Lee’s testimony that CW #2 told Dr. Lee that “she did it”
 because she “was scared” and “[d]idn’t want to get hit again.” 
3. 
As to the requisite state of mind under Counts 4 and 5, 
a person acts “knowingly” with respect to his or her conduct when he is aware that his conduct is of that nature. HRS § 702­206(2). This court has stated that “it is not necessary for the prosecution to introduce direct evidence of a defendant’s state of mind in order to prove that the defendant acted intentionally, knowingly or recklessly.” State v. Eastman, 81 Hawai' i 131, 
140-41, 913 P.2d 57, 66-67 (1996) (citing State v. Rushing, 62 Haw. 102, 106, 612 P.2d 103, 106-07 (1980)). “Given the difficulty of proving the requisite state of mind by direct evidence in criminal cases, proof by circumstantial evidence and reasonable inferences arising from circumstances surrounding the defendant’s conduct is sufficient.” Id. (citing State v. Batson, 
73 Haw. 236, 254, 831 P.2d 924, 934 (1992)). “The mind of an alleged offender may be read from his acts, conduct and inferences fairly drawn from all the circumstances.” Id. (citing 
Batson, 73 Haw. at 254, 831 P.2d at 934). 
As to whether Respondent knowingly subjected CW #2 to
 
an act of sexual penetration under Count 4, CW #2 testified that
 
31
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Respondent dragged her to a bench, undressed himself and CW #2 
before inserting his penis “[i]nto her mouth” and forcing her to perform oral sex on him. According to CW #2’s testimony, Respondent then told her that he was going to ejaculate “in [her] mouth” and she was “going to swallow it.” He then placed his penis into CW #2’s mouth a second time and ejaculated therein. It may be “‘reasonabl[y] infer[red] [] from [the] circumstances surrounding [Respondent]’s conduct[,]’” Eastman, 81 Hawai' i at 
140-41, 913 P.2d at 66-67 (citing Batson, 73 Haw. at 254, 831 P.2d at 934), that Respondent was “aware” he was placing his penis in CW #2’s mouth, thereby indicating that he knowingly subjected CW #2 to an act of sexual penetration under Count 4. 
As to whether Respondent knowingly subjected CW #2 to
 
an act of sexual penetration under Count 5, CW #2 testified that
 when they arrived at the school, Respondent said, “[Y]ou can tell
 your friends this is where you got fucked.” Before placing his
 penis into her vagina, Respondent dragged CW #2 by the hair to a
 bench, undressed himself and CW #2, and instructed CW #2 “to get
 on top of him.” It may be reasonably inferred from the
 circumstances surrounding Respondent’s conduct that Respondent
 was “aware” he was placing his penis into CW #2’s vagina, and
 therefore, knowingly subjected CW #2 to an act of sexual
 penetration under Count 5.
 
As to the element of strong compulsion, CW #2 testified
 
that Respondent continued to use force against her even after she
 started bleeding and blacked out. After being threatened and hit
 several times, CW #2 began screaming, but Respondent continued to
 
32
         
         
       
        
            
          
        
       ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
threaten and use force against CW #2. In addition, Respondent
 
threatened and used force against CW #2 more than once. It may
 be inferred from the circumstances that Respondent was “aware” he
 was using threats and force to overcome CW #2, and therefore,
 knowingly subjected CW #2 to acts of sexual penetration by strong
 compulsion.
 
In light of the foregoing, there was “overwhelming 
. . . evidence tending to show [Respondent] guilty [of Counts 4 and 5] beyond a reasonable doubt[.]” Toyomura, 80 Hawai' i at 27, 
904 P.2d at 912. 
B.
 
With respect to Counts 6 and 7, Respondent was charged
 
with two separate counts of Sexual Assault in the Third Degree. 
The jury was instructed as to Count 6 that the offense of Sexual
 Assault in the Third degree has three material elements: 
16
 (1) Respondent subjected CW #2 to sexual contact  by placing his
hand on her breast, (2) by strong compulsion, (3) and did so
 knowingly as to each element of the offense. The jury was
 instructed that the elements of Counts 7 were: (1) Respondent
 subjected CW #2 to sexual contact by placing his mouth on her
 breast, (2) by strong compulsion, (3) and did so knowingly as to
 each element of the offense. 
16
 HRS § 707-700 (Supp. 2009) defines “sexual contact” as follows:
 
“Sexual contact” means any touching, other than acts
 
of “sexual penetration”, of the sexual or other intimate
parts of a person not married to the actor, or of the sexual
or other intimate parts of the actor by the person, whether
directly or through the clothing or other material intended
to cover the sexual or other intimate parts.
 
33
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
1.
 
With respect to the first element of Counts 6 and 7, CW
 
#2 testified that Respondent “touched [her] breast, and . . . put
 
his mouth on her breast.” Dr. Lee corroborated the foregoing,
 testifying that CW #2 related to him during her physical
 examination that her assailant “fondled her . . . boobs” and
 “kissed her breasts[.]” He also testified that CW #2 told him
 that her assailant had bitten her breast, and noted that during
 his physical examination of CW #2, she had “minimal tenderness”
 in her left breast, meaning that “when Dr. Lee” touched it[, CW
 #2] was sensitive or . . . sore[.]” 
2.
 
As discussed in the previous section, there was
 
evidence supporting the element of strong compulsion for purposes
 of Counts 6 and 7.
 
3. 
With respect to whether Respondent knowingly subjected
 
Respondent to sexual contact under Counts 6 and 7, as indicated
 in the previous section, prior to Respondent placing his hand and
 mouth on CW #2’s breast, he dragged her to a bench by the hair,
 undressed himself and CW #2, and forced her to perform oral and
 vaginal sex. Thereafter, he “laid [her] down on the bench[,]”
 “kissed [her,]” and touched and placed his mouth on her breast. 
It may be reasonably inferred from the circumstances surrounding
 Respondent’s conduct that Respondent was “aware” he was touching
 and placing his mouth on CW #2’s breast, and therefore, knowingly
 subjected CW #2 to sexual contact.

       ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
With respect to the element of strong compulsion, for
 
the reasons discussed in the previous section, it may be inferred
 
from the circumstances that Respondent was aware he was using
 threats and force to overcome CW #2. Thus, there was evidence
 that Respondent knowingly subjected CW #2 to sexual contact, by
 strong compulsion.
 
Based on the foregoing, there was “overwhelming and 
compelling evidence tending to show [Respondent] guilty [of Counts 6 and 7] beyond a reasonable doubt” such that the “errors in the admission” of Dr. Lee’s testimony regarding threats may be “deemed harmless.” Toyomura, 80 Hawai' i at 27, 904 P.2d at 912 
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
C.
 
The jury was instructed as to Count 8 that the offense
 
of Kidnapping has three material elements: (1) Respondent
 
  18  19
 restrained CW #2,17	(2) intentionally or knowingly,  (3) with 
17	 HRS § 707-700 (1993) defines “restrain” as follows:
 
“Restrain” means to restrict a person’s movement in
such a manner as to interfere substantially with the
person’s liberty:
(1)	 By means of force, threat , or deception; or
 
(2)	 If the person is under the age of eighteen or
incompetent, without the consent of the
relative, person, or institution having lawful
custody of the person.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
18
 HRS § 702-206(1) (1993) defines “intentionally” as follows:
 
(a)	 A person acts intentionally with respect to his
conduct when it is his conscious object to engage in
such conduct.
 
(b)	 A person acts intentionally with respect to attendant
circumstances when he is aware of the existence of
 such circumstances or believes or hopes that they
exist.

        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
intent to inflict bodily injury upon CW #2 or subject CW #2 to a
 
sexual offense or terrorize CW #2. HRS § 707-720(d) & (e).
 
1.
 
As to the element of restraint, there was evidence that
 
Respondent “restrict[ed CW #2]’s movement in such a manner as to
 interfere substantially with [CW #2]’s liberty . . . [b]y means
 of force” and “threat.” HRS § 707-700. As to the use of force
 to restrain CW #2, CW #2 testified that when she asked Respondent
 to take her back and reached for her phone, Respondent grabbed it
 from her, struck her in the face and the back of the head several
 times, grabbed her hair, and pulled her down to the center
 console, causing her to bleed and “black[] out.” When CW #2
 attempted to escape from the vehicle, Respondent told her, “Oh,
 try and get out[,]” but when she grabbed the door handle, he
 “grabbed [her] hair again” and said, “What the fuck are you
 doing?” Then, when she tried to pull her hair away from
 Respondent, he hit her on the back of her head with his fist or
 elbow. As stated, CW #2’s testimony regarding the use of force
 against her was corroborated by the testimonies of Dr. Lee and
 Ogawa, as well as the physical evidence presented. See supra. 
As to the use of threats to restrain CW #2, CW #2
 
testified that when she started screaming and pleaded for
 Respondent to let her go, Respondent said, “Shut the fuck up or
 
18(...continued)
(c)	 A person acts intentionally with respect to a result
of his conduct when it is his conscious object to
cause such a result.
 
19
 See supra note 15 for the definition of “knowingly.”
 
36
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
I’m going to shoot you.” Respondent repeatedly warned, “Shut the
 
fuck up[,] . . . you’re going to do what I tell you to do.” 
According to CW #2’s testimony, she attempted to open the door to
 the vehicle but Respondent grabbed her hair and said, “Oh, what
 the fuck are you doing? I’m going to crack you again.” After
 she had tried to escape, Respondent told CW #2 that “[t]he last
 girl that was with [him] got out, but [] broke her collarbone.” 
Then, upon arriving at the school, Respondent told her, “[Y]ou’re
 going to do whatever I want you to do and then you can go; You’ll
 be fine if you do it.” She eventually kept quiet and ceased from
 attempting to escape because she was afraid Respondent would hurt
 or kill her. 
2.
 
As to the second element of Kidnapping, Respondent must
 
have intentionally or knowingly restrained CW #2 by use of
 threats or force. A person acts intentionally with respect to
 his conduct when it is his conscious object to engage in such
 conduct. HRS § 702-206(1). Here, there was evidence indicating
 that Respondent’s use of force was specifically in response to CW
 #2’s requests for Respondent to let her go and attempts to
 escape. According to CW #2, after she entered Respondent’s
 vehicle, when she told him to take her back, Respondent said,
 “Oh, why? Are you scared of me now?” When CW #2 reached for her
 cell phone because she was scared, Respondent struck her in the
 face and back of the head. Thereafter, he told her to try to
 escape, but he grabbed her by the hair and struck her on the back
 of her head with his fist or elbow when she tried to break free. 
37
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Similarly, Respondent’s threats against CW #2 were also
 
made specifically in response to CW #2’s request to let her go
 
and attempts to escape. When CW #2 began screaming and pleaded
 with Respondent to let her go, Respondent threatened to shoot CW
 #2. When she tried to escape from his vehicle, he threatened to
 strike her again. He then warned that another female’s attempt
 to escape resulted in the female breaking her collarbone. 
Respondent told CW #2 that if she did as he told her to, she
 would be “fine.” Here, there was evidence from which it may be
 inferred that it was Respondent’s conscious object to restrain CW
 #2 by means of threat of force.
 
As noted, a person acts “knowingly” with respect to his
 
conduct when he is aware that his conduct is of that nature. HRS
 § 702-206(2). It may also be inferred from the foregoing
 evidence that Respondent was “aware” he was restraining CW #2 by
 use of threat or force.
 
3.
 
As to the third element of Kidnapping, there was
 
evidence that Respondent restrained CW #2 with intent to inflict
 bodily injury upon CW #2, subject CW #2 to a sexual offense or
 terrorize CW #2. HRS § 707-720(d) & (e). As discussed supra,
 there was corroborated evidence that Respondent restrained CW #2
 for the purpose of terrorizing her with threats and to inflict
 bodily injury on her. There was also evidence that Respondent
 restrained her for the purpose of committing a sexual offense,
 i.e., sexual assault in the first and third degrees. See supra. 
In sum, there was “overwhelming and compelling evidence tending
 
38
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
to show [Respondent] guilty [of Count 8] beyond a reasonable 
doubt,” such that the “errors in the admission” of Dr. Lee’s testimony regarding threats may be “deemed harmless.” Toyomura, 
80 Hawai' i at 27, 904 P.2d at 912 (internal quotation marks and 
citation omitted). 
XI.
 
According to the ICA, the admission of Dr. Lee’s
 
threats was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because, in
 its view, the testimony “may have tipped the scale in favor of CW
 #2’s credibility.” Veikoso, 2010 WL 5037006, at *15. However,
 
even if the ICA was correct, Dr. Lee’s improper testimony
 regarding threats would have bolstered or corroborated CW #2’s
 testimony, if at all, only as to the alleged threats made by
 Respondent against her. With respect to Counts 4 through 7, the
 evidence of the other threats would support the element of strong
 compulsion. Notably, however, the element of strong compulsion
 may be proved by establishing that the actor used threats or
 force against a person. See HRS § 707-700 (defining “strong
 
compulsion” as “the use of or attempt to use” “[a] threat,
 express or implied, that places a person in fear of bodily injury
 to the individual or another person, or in fear that the person
 or another person will be kidnapped[] . . . or . . . [p]hysical
 force” “to overcome a person”) (emphases added). Similarly, as
 to Count 8, evidence of threats would support the element of
 restraint. But, that element may likewise be proved by
 establishing that the actor used threats or force against a
 person. See id. (defining “restraint” as “restrict[ing] a
 
39
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
person’s movement in such a manner as to interfere substantially
 
with the person’s liberty . . . [b]y means of force, threat, or
 deception”) (emphasis added). 
Here, there were numerous instances of threats other 
than the two objectionable ones related by Dr. Lee, that were corroborated by the evidence. Additionally, there was compelling evidence that Respondent not only threatened CW #2, but also used force against her. That testimony would not have been bolstered by Dr. Lee’s improper testimony regarding threats. Rather, CW #2’s testimony regarding force was corroborated by admissible testimony by Dr. Lee regarding physical injuries, Ogawa’s testimony, and the physical evidence presented in this case. Hence, there was overwhelming evidence of force used by Respondent to overcome CW #2, which would establish the element of “strong compulsion” for purposes of Sexual Assault in the First and Third Degree, and the element of “restraint” for purposes of Kidnapping, beyond Dr. Lee’s testimony regarding the two challenged threats. See State v. Haili, 103 Hawai' i 89, 106, 
79 P.3d 1263, 1280 (2003) (concluding that “[t]he erroneous admission of evidence that [the victim] told others that [the defendant] was threatening to kill her” was “harmless” because “[e]ven without the admission of this hearsay testimony, the jury still would have heard testimony that [the defendant] threatened [the victim’s] life”); see also State v. Perez, 64 Haw. 232, 234, 638 P.2d 335, 337 (1981) (stating that even if it could be said that the trial court erred in admitting testimony regarding the contents of an anonymous phone call, the error was harmless 
40
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
beyond a reasonable doubt because “[t]he anonymous phone call was 
not the only evidence that connected appellant to the victim”; the victim identified the defendant’s picture as her attacker, noted that the defendant was wearing the same coat he was wearing when she was attacked, and also identified him in court). In that light, there is no “possibility” of a “reasonable” nature that the error “contributed to [Respondent’s] conviction.” Machado, 109 Hawai' i at 452, 127 P.3d at 948. Thus, the error 
was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 
XII. 
Based on the foregoing, the ICA gravely erred in
 
concluding that Dr. Lee’s testimony regarding two threats was not
 harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Veikoso, 2010 WL 5037006, at
 
*15. Accordingly, we reverse the February 1, 2011 Judgment of
 the ICA insofar as it vacated the court’s September 28, 2009
 Judgment as to Respondent’s conviction for Counts 4-8, and we
 reinstate and affirm the court’s said September 28, 2009 Judgment
 as to Counts 4-8.
