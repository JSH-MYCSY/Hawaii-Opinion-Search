OPINION OF THE COURT BY NAKAYAMA, J.
 
On application for writ of certiorari, Petitioner-
Defendant Herman Decoite (Decoite) asks us to determine whether
 
Abuse of Family or Household Member, HRS § 709-906(1), can be
 charged as a “continuing course of conduct” offense. 
On narrower
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
grounds, we hold that an alleged two-year period of domestic
 
abuse could not be charged on a continuing course of conduct
 theory. Accordingly, we reverse the Intermediate Court of
 Appeals’s (ICA) judgment on appeal and affirm the Circuit Court
 of the Second Circuit’s (family court) order dismissing the
 State’s complaint without prejudice.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
This case arises out of alleged acts of domestic abuse 
that Decoite committed against his former girlfriend over the course of their five-year relationship. On April 3, 2009, the State filed a misdemeanor complaint against Decoite, charging him with one count of abuse of a family or household member (domestic abuse) pursuant to Hawai' i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 709-906 
(Supp. 2006).
1 The complaint stated in relevant part: “during or 
about the period between February 1, 2005, through June 1, 2007, inclusive, as a continuing course of conduct, . . . Herman Decoite did intentionally, knowingly or recklessly engage in and cause physical abuse of a family or household member[.]” 
Decoite requested discovery, and the State produced
 
police reports of two incidents that occurred on November 29,
 2006, and March 13, 2007, respectively. Decoite then filed a
 
1
 HRS § 709-906(1) provided then as it does now: “It shall be
 
unlawful for any person, singly or in concert, to physically abuse a family or
household member[.]”
 
2
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
motion to dismiss the State’s complaint in the family court.2
 
Decoite argued that the domestic abuse statute does not permit
 
charging domestic abuse as a continuous crime, and also that the
 only incidents of alleged domestic abuse produced in discovery
 fell outside of the applicable two-year statute of limitations. 
The State responded that the domestic abuse statute punishes
 “physical abuse,” and that because physical abuse can extend
 beyond isolated moments, it may be charged on a theory of
 continuing conduct. The State further argued that its complaint
 against Decoite was not time barred because it had alleged a
 continuing course of conduct that ended within the two-year
 statute of limitations. 
The family court concluded that domestic abuse cannot
 
be charged on a continuous conduct theory, and issued an order
 dismissing the State’s complaint without prejudice. On appeal,
 the ICA reversed, holding that in some cases domestic abuse may
 be charged as a continuous offense. We granted Decoite’s
 application for writ of certiorari to resolve this issue as a
 matter of first impression. 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
A. Conclusions of Law 
Conclusions of law are reviewed de novo under the

right/wrong standard. Chun v. Bd. of Trs. of Emps.’ Ret. Sys. of
 
Haw., 106 Hawai' i 416, 431, 106 P.3d 339, 354 (2005). 
B. Statutory Interpretation
 
When interpreting a statute, this court follows several
 
well established canons of interpretation. 
“[O]ur foremost obligation is to ascertain and give effect
to the intention of the legislature, which is obtainedprimarily from the language contained in the statute[s]”themselves.  Mathewson v. Aloha Airlines, Inc., 82 Hawai 'i 
57, 71, 919 P.2d 969, 983 (1996) (citation and quotationsignals omitted).   Second, “[l]aws in pari materia, or uponthe same subject matter, shall be construed with referenceto each other.  What is clear in one statute may be calledin aid to explain what is doubtful in another.”  HRS § 1–16(1993); Richardson v. City and County of Honolulu, 76Hawai'i 46, 55, 868 P.2d 1193, 1202 (1994) (citation
omitted).  And, third, “[t]he legislature is presumed not tointend an absurd result, and legislation will be construedto avoid, if possible, inconsistency, contradiction[,] andillogicality.”  State v. Malufau, 80 Hawai 'i 126, 137, 906
P.2d 612, 623 (1995) (citation and internal quotation marksomitted). 
State v. Arceo, 84 Hawai' i 1, 19, 928 P.2d 843, 861 (1996) (some 
citations omitted). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
A. Domestic abuse cannot be charged as a continuing conduct
offense based on discrete abusive transactions that occurred over
 
a two-year period 
The conduct element of the domestic abuse statute
 
states in relevant part: “It shall be unlawful for any person 
. . . to physically abuse a family or household member[.]” HRS §
 709-906(1) (emphasis added). The narrow issue of this case is
 whether that conduct, “to physically abuse,” permits the State to
 
4
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
charge two temporally discrete instances of domestic abuse on a
 
continuous course of conduct theory. The State argues that
 abusive domestic relationships are defined by a cycle of violence
 that is motivated by the abuser’s singular desire for power and
 control. Thus, the State would have us hold that temporally
 discrete acts of abuse can all be linked to one continuous
 criminal impulse that forms the basis of one crime. However, HRS
 § 709-906(1) criminalizes “physical abuse,” which is conduct that
 is necessarily discrete and episodic. In fact, the discrete
 nature of the actus reus of domestic abuse is a crucial element
 of the statutory scheme’s graduated penalty structure, which is
 specifically tailored to punish repeated acts of abuse separately
 and with increasing severity. Accordingly, we hold that HRS §
 709-906(1) does not permit charging temporally discrete episodes
 of domestic abuse that occurred over a two-year period as a
 continuous course of conduct offense.
3
 
The test to determine whether a crime may be charged on
 
a continuous conduct theory is whether the language, structure,
 and purpose of the statute reveals a legislative intent to
 criminalize continuing conduct. See HRS § 701-108(4) (supp.
 
2006) (“An offense is committed either when every element occurs,
 
3
 However, a single violent transaction comprised of, for example,
 
several punches, may constitute one continuous episode of domestic abuse.  The
 
episode terminates when the perpetrator’s physically abusive impulse ends. 
5
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
or, if a legislative purpose to prohibit a continuing course of 
conduct plainly appears, at the time when the course of conduct. . . is terminated.”); see also Arceo, 84 Hawai' i at 19, 928 P.2d 
at 861 (stating that an offense may be deemed continuous if it is statutorily defined as an uninterrupted and continuing course of conduct, or manifests a plain legislative purpose to be treated as such, or both). Additionally, a crime may only be charged on the theory of continuing conduct if the statute actually prohibits conduct that may be deemed continuous. See State v. 
Rabago, 103 Hawai' i 236, 253, 81 P.3d 1151, 1168 (2003) 
(rejecting the legislature’s attempt to define the continuing sexual abuse of a minor as a continuous offense because the actus reus of the statute was actually targeting a series of necessarily discrete criminal acts). 
This court has defined a continuous offense as “a 
continuous, unlawful act or series of acts set on foot by a single impulse and operated by an unintermittent force, however long a time it may occupy[.]” Arceo, 84 Hawai' i at 18, 928 P.2d 
at 860 (quoting State v. Temple, 65 Haw. 261, 267 n.6, 650 P.2d 1358, 1362 n.6 (1982)). “The test to determine whether [a] defendant intended to commit more than one offense in the course of a criminal episode is whether the evidence discloses one general intent or discloses separate and distinct intents.”

State v. Castro, 69 Haw. 633, 653, 756 P.2d 1033, 1047 (1988)
 
(citations omitted). “If there is but one intention, one general
 impulse, and one plan, there is but one offense.” Id.
 
We first applied this rule in State v. Martin, 62 Haw. 
364, 369, 616 P.2d 193, 197 (1980), where we held that first degree theft could constitute a continuous offense. There, the defendant periodically filed fraudulent public assistance forms for a six-year period in order to obtain welfare disbursements from the State. Id. at 366, 616 P.2d at 195-96. We held that 
the defendant had committed a continuing offense because each fraudulent transaction was the continuation of a single and uninterrupted criminal impulse. Id. at 369, 616 P.2d at 197 (“We 
do not view each filing by defendant of a statement of facts supporting continued eligibility as necessarily constituting a new offense, since all statements were identical[.]”); see also Temple, 65 Haw. at 267, 650 P.2d at 1362 (holding that theft of a firearm was a continuous offense because the conduct element of the theft statute specifically criminalized the ongoing act of “retaining” stolen property); State v. Kealoha, 95 Hawai' i 365, 
376, 22 P.3d 1012, 1023 (App. 2000) (holding that manufacturing a dangerous drug may be a single continuous offense because the general character of “manufacturing” connotes an ongoing process of various steps that are motivated by one uninterrupted 
7
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
impulse). 
We have also found continuing conduct in criminal 
transactions that were temporally quite short. For example, in 
State v. Rapoza, we held that attempted murder in the second degree could constitute a continuing offense. 95 Hawai' i 321, 
329, 22 P.3d 968, 976 (2001). There, Rapoza discharged a firearm five to seven times in the span of a few seconds while pointing it in the general direction of three complaining witnesses. Id. 
at 323, 22 P.3d at 970. We stated: “As to any given complainant, [Rapoza’s] conduct in discharging the firearm several times did not amount to ‘separate and distinct culpable acts,’ but rather betokened ‘a continuous, unlawful . . . series of acts set on foot by a single impulse and operated by an unintermittent force[.]’” Id. at 329, 22 P.3d at 976 (quoting Arceo, 84 Hawai' i 
at 18, 928 P.2d at 860). 
Turning to the statute at issue in this case, the 
conduct element of HRS § 709-906(1) makes it a crime to “physically abuse” a family or household member. We have defined the term “physically abuse” for purposes of HRS § 709-906(1) as follows: “To ‘physically abuse’ someone is to maltreat in such a manner as to cause injury, hurt or damage to that person’s body.” State v. Fields, 115 Hawai' i 503, 530, 168 P.3d 955, 982 (2007) 
(citations and internal quotations omitted). Physical abuse, so 
8
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
defined, contemplates discrete episodes that are transitory in
 
nature, whether those events occur in isolation or in a series. 
Cf. Temple, 65 Haw. at 267, 650 P.2d at 1362 (distinguishing the
 non-continuous criminal acts “receive” and “dispose” from the
 continuous act “retain,” because the former are transitory in
 nature and of a brief duration). In that respect, “physical
 abuse” is unlike “retaining” a stolen firearm, or “manufacturing”
 methamphetamine, which involve ongoing processes. 
Furthermore, the touchstone characteristic of a
 
continuing offense is that it is motivated by a single
 uninterrupted criminal impulse. See Martin, 62 Haw. at 369, 616
 
P.2d at 197. That domestic abuse may occur repetitively, as the
 State claims, helps to illustrate that cyclic abuse is a non­continuous crime. First, the State attached to its opposition to
 Decoite’s motion to dismiss sample testimony from a domestic
 violence expert. That testimony illustrates that in cases of
 repetitive domestic abuse, many superseding impulses and
 intermittent forces are at work: 
The cycle of violence . . . starts off when people first
start dating and everything is good, and there’s no tension.
And the relationship starts to progress, and something will
begin to create tension. 
So one of the phases in the cycle of violence is called the
tension building phase.  So during this phase . . .
something . . . starts to create tension and they begin to
argue a little bit about it.  
And the tension continues to build.  And in an abusive
 
relationship, a final outburst will happen.  And that’s what
 
9
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
we call the violent outburst phase.  And after -­
immediately after the violence, typically the abuser is
feeling very remorseful, and sorry, and apologizes, and
tries to make repairs, make amends for the behavior.  And
 that’s the apologetic, loving reconciliation phase, so that
after the violence happens, the abuser is very sorry and
conciliatory. 
. . . . 
And so they bond and become closer.  And then we have the
 
honeymoon phase, where everything is good and there is no
tension, and life’s pretty good. And what happens is we go
from the honeymoon phase -- and then there is always
something that creates tension[.] 
As the sample testimony shows, during the “loving reconciliation”
 
phase following a violent incident, a serial abuser typically
 feels remorse and will try to repair the relationship. In other
 words, the serial abuser’s malignant impulses are frequently
 interrupted by the contrary impulse to set things right. This
 characterization of serial abuse does not fit with the definition
 of a continuing offense, which requires a single, uninterrupted
 criminal impulse.
4 See Martin, 62 Haw. at 369, 616 P.2d at 197. 
Second, statutory and case law make clear that the
 
single impulse underlying a continuing offense must be a criminal
 impulse. See, e.g., Martin, 62 Haw. at 369, 616 P.2d at 197
 
(recognizing that repeated fraudulent filings were motivated by

 Decoite argues that the ICA erred when it considered the State’s 
proferred evidence.    HRAP 10(a) states: “The record on appeal shall consist
of the trial court . . . record, as set out in Rule 4 of the Hawai 'i Court 
Records Rules[.]”  Hawai 'i Court Records Rules (HCRR) Rule 4 states: “The
record of each case . . . shall include: (a) all documents related to thecase, including correspondence, submitted for filing in any form[.]”  Here,all of the documents that Decoite claims should not be part of the record onappeal were attached to the State’s opposition to Decoite’s motion to dismiss. Thus, these documents were properly considered on appeal. 
10
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the single criminal impulse to steal from the State); Temple, 65 
Haw. at 267, 650 P.2d at 1362 (recognizing that retaining a stolen firearm was motivated by the single criminal impulse to steal the firearm); Kealoha, 95 Hawai' i at 376-78, 22 P.3d at 
1023-25 (recognizing that the various steps of methamphetamine production were all motivated by the single criminal impulse to manufacture a dangerous drug). HRS § 701-104 (1993) specifically states: “The provisions of [the HRS] cannot be extended by analogy so as to create crimes not provided for herein[.]” If we allowed a continuous crime to be founded on a non-criminal impulse, then we would be extending the provisions of the penal code by analogy in direct violation of HRS § 701-104. 
Here, the State has posited that a serial abuser is
 
motivated by a single continuous impulse, the desire for power
 and control in a relationship. However, the actus reus of HRS §
 709-906(1) is physical abuse. HRS § 709-906(1) does not
 contemplate psychological abuse. Attempting to exert power and
 control in a relationship, on its own, is not illegal. Thus,
 although the desire for power and control merits no praise, it is
 not a criminal impulse that can support charging domestic abuse
 on a continuing conduct theory. 
Finally, the overarching structure of the domestic
 
abuse statute provides compelling evidence that the legislature
 
11
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
intended repeated acts of abuse to be treated as separate crimes. 
Specifically, the graduated penalty provisions of HRS § 709-906
 provide:
 
(5) Abuse of a family or household member [is a] . . .
misdemeanor[] and the person shall be sentenced as follows:
 
(a) For the first offense the person shall serve a
minimum jail sentence of forty-eight hours; and
 
(b) For a second offense that occurs within one year
of the first conviction, the person shall be termed a
“repeat offender” and serve a minimum jail sentence of
thirty days.
5
 
. . . .
 
(7) For a third or any subsequent offense that occurs within
two years of a second or subsequent conviction, the offense
shall be a class C felony.
 
This penalty structure is specifically tailored to address the
 
repetitive and cyclic nature of domestic abuse. It evinces a
 legislative determination that multiple acts of abuse constitute
 separate offenses that should be punished separately and with
 increasing severity. The House Judiciary Committee made this
 plain when it stated: 
The nature of domestic abuse is such that ongoing violence
is not uncommon and, in fact, has the great likelihood of
becoming more serious and increasing in frequency.  Your
 Committee understands that uniform sanctions applied in a 
graduated way in response to these serious offenses will
deliver a strong message to the offenders[.]
 
5
 In State v. Dudoit, we held that “the repeat offender provision of 
HRS § 709-906(5) applies to the commission of successive violations of HRS §709-906 and not merely to successive convictions of such violations” and thatit “may be applied to offenses occurring on the same day.”  90 Hawai 'i 262,
266, 274, 978 P.2d 700, 704, 712 (1999) (capitalization and quotationsomitted). 
12
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 20-92, in 1992 House Journal, at 906. 
Charging multiple discrete acts of domestic abuse as a single
 continuous crime, as the State did here, conflicts with the
 domestic abuse statute’s graduated penalty structure. 
In sum, the family court properly dismissed the State’s
 
complaint because it defectively charged Decoite with domestic
 abuse under a continuing course of conduct theory. As a matter
 of law, an alleged two-year period of domestic abuse can never be
 charged as a continuous conduct offense.

IV. CONCLUSION
 
For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the ICA’s
 
judgment on appeal and affirm the family court’s order dismissing
 the State’s complaint without prejudice.

 Our holding does not prevent a criminal defendant from invoking
 
HRS § 701-109(1)(e) (1993) in an attempt to merge multiple counts of domestic
abuse that factually arise from a single, discrete criminal transaction.  See
