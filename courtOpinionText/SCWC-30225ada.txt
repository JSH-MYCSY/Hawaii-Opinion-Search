RECKTENWALD, C.J., NAKAYAMA, ACOBA, DUFFY, AND MCKENNA, JJ.
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY ACOBA, J.
 
We hold that (1) where, in an ejectment proceeding
 
filed in district court, a defendant seeks to raise a defense to
 
the court’s jurisdiction pursuant to District Court Rules of
 
1
Civil Procedure (DCRCP) Rule 12.1,  on the ground that the action
1
 DCRCP Rule 12.1, entitled “Defense of Title in District Courts,”
 
provides:
 
(continued...)
         
 
     
   
           ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
is one in which title to real estate will come into question, the
 
defendant must set forth in the affidavit “the source, nature,
 and extent of the title claimed by defendant” with sufficient
 detail or specificity to “fully apprise the court of the nature
 of” its claim to title of the property in question; (2)
 additionally, the defendant may include in the affidavit any
 other particulars that would enable the court to be fully
 apprised of the defendant’s claim; but (3) in the instant case,
 the affidavit of Respondent/Defendant-Appellant Wayne Peelua
 (Respondent) neither included specificity or detail regarding the
 source, nature, and extent of title claimed nor other particulars
 that would fully apprise the District Court of the Second
 
2
Circuit, Lahaina Division (the court),  of his claim to title;
and therefore, his defense failed under DCRCP Rule 12.1 and the
 court properly exercised its jurisdiction over the ejectment
 action filed by Petitioner/Plaintiff-Appellee Deutsche Bank
 National Trust Company.
 
1(...continued)
Whenever,  in  the  district  court,  in  defense  of  an  action  in
the  nature  of  an  action  of  trespass  or  for  the  summary
possession  of  land,  or  any  other  action,  the  defendant  shall
seek  to  interpose  a  defense  to  the  jurisdiction  to  the
effect  that  the  action  is  a  real  action,  or  one  in  which  the
title  to  real  estate  is  involved,  such  defense  shall  be
asserted  by  a  written  answer  or  written  motion,  which  shall
not  b e  received  by  the  court  unless  accompanied  by  an
affidavit  of  the  defendant,  setting  forth  the  source,  nature
and  extent  of  the  title  claimed  by  defendant  to  the  land  in
question,  and  such  further  particulars  as  shall  fully
apprise  the  court  of  the  nature  of  defendant's  claim.

Petitioner filed its application for writ of
 
3	 4
certiorari on September 2, 2011 (Application).  Petitioner
 
sought review of the June 7, 2011 judgment of the ICA filed
 
pursuant to its May 17, 2011 Summary Disposition Order (SDO),5
 
vacating the November 18, 2009 Judgment for Possession filed by
 the court and remanding the case with instructions to dismiss the
 
case for lack of jurisdiction. 
I.
 
The following essential matters, some verbatim, are
 
from the record and the submissions of the parties.
 
The instant action arises from an ejectment proceeding
 
involving a dispute as to whether Respondent alleged a cognizable
 
claim to the title of real property located at 4570 Lower
 Honoapiilani Road in Lahaina, Hawai' i (the Property) that was 
purchased by Petitioner. On April 13, 2009, Petitioner, as
 
3 Pursuant to Hawai 'i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 602-59 (Supp. 2010), 
a party may appeal the decision and judgment of the intermediate appellate
court (the ICA) only by an application to this court for a writ of certiorari.See HRS § 602-59(a). In determining whether to accept or reject the
application for writ of certiorari, this court reviews the ICA decision for: 
(1)	 Grave errors of law or of fact; or
 
(2)	 Obvious inconsistencies in the decision of the [ICA]
with that of the supreme court, federal decisions, or
its own decision, and the magnitude of those errors or
inconsistencies dictating the need for further appeal.
 
HRS § 602-59(b). The grant or denial of a petition for certiorari is
discretionary with this court. See HRS § 602-59(a).

 Petitioner brought the instant action as Trustee Under the Pooling
 
and Servicing Agreement Relating to Impac Secured Assets Corp., Mortgage Pass-
through Certificates, Series 2007-2.

trustee, held a foreclosure auction and purchased the Property
 
for $752,000.00. On April 22, 2009, counsel for Petitioner
 mailed a written notice to Respondent, who occupied the Property
 at the time, notifying him that he was to vacate the Property
 within 10 days. On May 19, 2009, Petitioner recorded a Quitclaim
 Deed in the Bureau of Conveyances of the State of Hawai' i, as 
Document Number 2009-077170. 
On July 14, 2009, Petitioner filed a complaint in the
 
court alleging, inter alia, that the court had jurisdiction over
 
6
the matter pursuant to HRS § 604-5;  Petitioner was the fee
simple owner of the Property by virtue of a non-judicial
 foreclosure sale; Petitioner was entitled to possession of the
 Property; Petitioner’s counsel sent written notice to Respondent
 on April 22, 2009 to vacate the Property within ten days;
 Respondent was still in possession of the Property in violation 
6 HRS § 604-5 (Supp. 2009) provides in relevant part as follows:
 
(a) Except as otherwise provided, the district courts
shall have jurisdiction in all civil actions where the . . .
value of the property claimed does not exceed $25,000,
except in civil actions involving summary possession or
ejectment, in which case the district court shall have
jurisdiction over any counterclaim otherwise properly
brought by any defendant in the action if the counterclaim
arises out of and refers to the land or damages, or the
property claim contained in the counterclaim.
 . . . .
 
(d) The district courts shall not have cognizance of
real actions, nor actions in which the title to real estate
comes in question , nor actions for libel, slander,
defamation of character, malicious prosecution, false
imprisonment, breach of promise of marriage, or seduction;
nor shall they have power to appoint referees in any cause.

of Petitioner’s rights, and Petitioner was entitled to immediate
 
possession of the Property.7
 
On July 30, 2009, Respondent filed an answer to and
 
motion to dismiss Petitioner’s complaint. Therein, Respondent
 alleged that pursuant to DCRCP Rule 12.1 and this court’s
 decision in Kimball v. Lincoln, 72 Haw. 117, 809 P.2d 1130
 
8
 the court lacked jurisdiction over the matter because
 (1991),the action was “a real action and one in which title to real
 
9 10 
 estate is involved[,]”  and under HRS § 414-432,  Petitioner
 
could not maintain the action since it was not registered to
 
7 Petitioner sought the following relief:
 
A. That Judgment for Possession be entered giving
[Petitioner] exclusive possession of the Property.
B. That a Writ of Possession issue forthwith directing the
Sheriff or Police Officer to:
 
1. Remove [Respondent] from the Property and all
persons possessing the Property through [Respondent].
2. Remove from the Property all personal property; and
3. Put [Petitioner] in possession of the Property.
C. That [Petitioner] be awarded Court costs, interest,
reasonable attorney’s fees, and any and all other damages or
charges arising out of [Respondent’s] unlawful occupancy of
the Property and that a monetary Judgment for the total
amount awarded be entered against [Respondent] and in the
case of more than one [Respondent], Judgment be entered
jointly and severally against all [Respondents].
D. Such further and other relief as the Court shall deem
 
just and proper.
 
8 Kimball explained that the district court has no jurisdiction over
 
a summary possession action where the defendant disputes that there was a
relationship of landlord and tenant because under those circumstances, title
is in question. See 72 Haw. at 125, 809 P.2d at 1134.
 
9
 As indicated supra, HRS § 604-5(d) provides that “[t]he district
 
courts shall not have cognizance of real actions, nor actions in which the
title to real estate comes in question.”
 
10
 HRS § 414-432(a) provides in relevant part that “[a] foreign
 
corporation transacting business in this State without a certificate of
authority may not maintain a proceeding in any court in this State until it
obtains a certificate of authority.”

conduct business in the State of Hawai' i. Attached to the motion 
was an affidavit that stated in relevant part as follows:
 
5. I am the owner of the Property identified in the
Complaint filed in this matter . Because of time
 
constraints, I cannot file a copy of my Deed to the property
with this affidavit, but I will furnish a copy of the Deed
as soon as I can.
 
6. The Property identified in the Complaint
consists of lands which have been owned by [Respondent’s]
family for generations, going back to the time of the Great
Mahele.
 
. . . .
 
8. The Property has passed down though my family
over time, and it was eventually deeded to me by my family .
 
. . . .
 
10. . . . I was defrauded, duped, coerced and
tricked into engaging in transaction which involve the
Property in the Complaint.
 
(Emphases added).
 
On September 28, 2009, Petitioner filed a Memorandum in
 
Opposition to Respondent’s Motion to Dismiss. Therein,
 
Petitioner asserted that although Respondent sought dismissal on
 the ground that the court lacks “jurisdiction to hear and settle
 disputes affecting title to real property[,]” Respondent “failed
 to present any credible evidence that would sustain his burden of
 proof under Rule 12.1.” 
Petitioner averred that (1) Respondent’s Motion to
 
Dismiss must be denied unless Respondent swore under oath that he
 signed the Note and Mortgage dated January 23, 2007 in favor of
 
11
 Impac Funding  as mortgagee, for the principal sum of
$
789,000.00 and “paid all installments as and when they were 
11
 It appears from the briefs that Impac Funding is the entity that
 
was in possession of the Property and was responsible for transferring it to
Petitioner at the time of the foreclosure sale.
 
6
         
  
          
      ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
due[,]” (2) the Note and Mortgage were only paid through July 1,
 
2008 and no payments were made after that date, and (3) as a
 result of Respondent’s “material default,” Respondent’s interest
 was foreclosed, thereby terminating his interest in the Property.
 
On November 18, 2009, the court entered Judgment for
 
Possession in favor of Petitioner. The Judgment for Possession
 ordered, adjudged, and decreed that Petitioner was entitled to
 possession of the Property and that a writ of possession be
 issued against Respondent.
 
Respondent filed his notice of appeal on December 7,
 
2009.
 
II.
 
On appeal to the ICA, Respondent raised two points of 
error: (1) the court lacked jurisdiction over the matter by virtue of the provisions of HRS § 604-5(d), and erred in denying Respondent’s Motion to Dismiss based upon lack of jurisdiction, and (2) the court erred in allowing Petitioner to maintain its action, contrary to the provisions of HRS § 414-432, inasmuch as Petitioner had not registered with the State of Hawai' i to 
conduct business in this state.
12 
Relevant to Petitioner’s Application, the ICA held
 
that, pursuant to HRS § 604-5(d), the court lacked jurisdiction
 over this matter. Deutsche Bank Nat. Trust Co. v. Peelua, No.
 
12
 This issue was not raised in any application for writ of
 
certiorari and, therefore, is not addressed herein.
 
7
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
30225, 2011 WL 1909111, at *3 (App. May 17, 2011) (SDO). In its
 
decision, the ICA concluded that (1) pursuant to HRS § 604–5(d),
 “‘[t]he district courts shall not have cognizance of real
 actions, nor actions in which the title to real estate comes in
 question[,]’” id. at *1, (2) DCRCP Rule 12.1 requires a defense
 to the court’s jurisdiction be “‘asserted by a written answer or
 written motion . . . accompanied by an affidavit of the
 defendant, setting forth the source, nature and extent of the
 title claimed by defendant to the land in question, and such
 further particulars as shall fully apprise the court of the
 nature of defendant’s claim[,]’” id. (emphases in original), (3)
 although the court denied Respondent’s Motion to Dismiss because
 Respondent had not provided a deed or colorable instrument of
 title, “there is no requirement that a deed or instrument of
 title be provided to the [court,]” id. at *2 (citing Brown v.
 Koloa Sugar Co., 12 Haw. 409, 411 (Haw. Terr. 1900), (4) DCRCP
 Rule 12.1 “requires an affidavit from the defendant stating ‘the
 source, nature and extent of the title claimed’ by the defendant”
 and here, Respondent stated the source of his title was his
 family and that the Property had been deeded to him[,] 
id., (5)
 
although “‘[t]he source, nature and extent of the title could
 have been described more precisely[,]’” the “‘failure to do so,
 did not make the affidavit deficient[,]’” 
id. (quoting Monette v.
 
Benjamin, 52 Haw. 246, 248, 473 P.2d 864, 865 (1970)), (6) Aames

         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Funding Corp. v. Mores, relied upon by Petitioner, is 
distinguishable because the declaration in Aames “simply asserted in a conclusory fashion that title was at issue” and failed to raise issues “‘germane to informing the court as to the source, nature, and extent of the title claimed by the [defendants] as to the land in question[,]’” id. (quoting Aames, 107 Hawai' i 95, 99­
100, 110 P.3d 1042, 1046-47 (2005)), and (7) the court appears to have considered the quitclaim deed attached to Petitioner’s complaint in denying Respondent’s Motion to Dismiss and DCRCP Rule 12.1 does not provide for consideration of counter-affidavits or counter-evidence. Id. (citing Monette, 52 Haw. at 
250, 473 P.2d at 866). 
III.
 
Petitioner lists the following questions in its
 
Application:
 
A. Whether . . . [the] Affidavit of [Respondent]
sufficiently set[s] forth the “source, nature and extent of
 
the title claimed” as required by the [DCRCP].
 B. Whether Petitioner’s Quitclaim Deed qualifies as
counter-evidence or a counter-affidavit thereby barring its
consideration by [the court] under Rule 12.1 of the DCRCP.
 
IV.
 
With respect to Petitioner’s first question, HRS 
§ 604-(d) precludes the district courts of this state from
 
exercising jurisdiction in “real actions . . . in which the title
 to real estate comes in[to] question[.]” Pursuant to DCRCP Rule
 12.1, where a defendant seeks to assert, as a defense to the 
9
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
jurisdiction of a district court, that the action is one in which
 
title to real estate will come into question, the defendant must
 raise such a defense in a written answer or written motion, and
 must attach an affidavit thereto. 
This court has explained that DCRCP Rule 12.1 is
 
derived from an order to district courts that was issued on March
 1, 1895. See Monette, 52 Haw. at 250, 473 P.2d at 865. Monette
 
related that prior to the “issuance of that order, entry of a
 plea to jurisdiction, without more, ousted a district court of
 jurisdiction.” Id. This court expressed concern that the rule
 
in effect at the time presented an opportunity for abuse. Id. 
In Coney v. Manele, 4 Haw. 154, 158 (Haw. Kingdom 1879), it was
 stated that, “[i]f dishonest pleas should be set up by
 defendants, undoubtedly effectual means will be found to obviate
 the effects of such dishonesty.” Then again, in Ward v.
 Kamanaoulu, 9 Haw. 619, 621 (Haw. Rep. 1895), this court
 emphasized that it was “aware of the mischiefs that are likely to
 occur where reckless or dishonest pleas of this character may be
 set up, compelling parties in the maintenance of their possession
 of land to resort to the higher courts for the pursuit of their
 remedies.” The order to the district courts was issued four days
 after this court’s opinion in Ward. See Monette, 52 Haw. at 248,
 
473 P.2d at 865.
 
V.
 
Under the plain language of Rule 12.1, an affidavit
 
10
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
that raises a defense to the court’s jurisdiction must set forth
 
“the source, nature, and extent of the title claimed by
 defendant” and “further particulars” sufficient to “fully apprise
 the court of the nature of defendant’s claim.” The phrase
 “further particulars” indicates that the reference to “source,
 extent, and nature” of the claim are “particulars” of the
 defense, whose purpose is to “fully apprise” the court of the
 defendant’s claim to title. DCRCP Rule 12.1 (Emphasis added). 
Although DCRCP Rule 12.1 does not define the term “particulars,”
 that term suggests that the affidavit must include some details
 or specificity regarding the nature of the defendant’s claim. 
See Merriam Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary 847 (10th ed. 1989)
 (defining “particular,” inter alia, as “a specific item or detail
 of information”; “of, relating to, or concerned with details”;
 “concerned over or attentive to details”). 
Thus, the source, nature, and extent of title claimed
 
by the defendant, must be described to the court with some detail
 and specificity. In addition to particularly describing the
 source, nature, and extent of title, the defendant may also
 include in the affidavit any other particulars, the objective
 being to apprise the court fully of the nature of the defendant’s
 claim. This, in turn, would obviate the risk of dishonest and
 reckless pleas, as well as other “mischiefs,” which the Ward and
 Coney courts sought to eliminate. See supra.

      ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
VI.
 
Monette is instructive as to Petitioner’s first
 
question. In that case, the defendants entered a plea to
 
jurisdiction under HRS § 604-5, supported by affidavits. 52 Haw.
 at 250, 473 P.2d at 864. At issue was whether the affidavits
 adequately set forth the source, nature, and extent of the title
 claimed by the defendants. See id. at 250, 473 P.2d at 865. 
This court observed that the affidavit of defendant
 
Alice Benjamin had declared that: 
she [was] the daughter of George Kipapa, who died in 1921,
and Julia Kipapa, who died in 1945; that in 1922, she, her
mother, and her five brothers moved into a house built by
her grandfather on his land at Pahoehoe 3 in North Kona,
being the land mentioned in the complaint, which her father
had inherited from his father; that she lived in the house
from 1922 on, first with her mother and brothers, and later
with her husband, whom she married in 1932; and that she
claimed ownership of the property for herself and her
brothers by inheritance from her father, who had inherited
the same from his father.
 
Id. at 248, 473 P.2d at 865. 
It was concluded that the “affidavit set forth all of
 
the information called for in the rule.” Id. According to
 
Monette: 
A fair reading of the affidavit show[ed] that Alice Benjamin
claimed title to the land in question by inheritance from
her father, who in turn had inherited from his father , and
that the title claimed by her was an undivided one-sixth
interest in fee simple , which descended to her by intestate
succession from the immediately preceding sole owner.
 
Id. (emphases added). Hence, the Monette court determined that
 
the affidavit of Alice Benjamin was sufficient under the rule. 
See id.
 
12
         
       
          
            
            
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Aames is also instructive. In Aames, as in the instant 
case, Aames Funding Corp. (Aames) acquired title to property 
following a non-judicial foreclosure sale. 107 Hawai' i at 96-97, 
110 P.3d at 1043-44. After the defendants (the Moreses) refused to surrender possession of the property, Aames filed an ejectment action in district court. Id. at 97, 110 P.3d at 1044. In 
response, the Moreses filed a joint declaration objecting to the jurisdiction of the district court pursuant to DCRCP Rule 12.1. Id. Therein, the Moreses declared, “‘[T]his action involves a 
dispute as to title to real property’” and “‘We claim that we have title to the [p]roperty.’” Id. at 99, 110 P.3d at 1046 
(brackets omitted). 
The Moreses subsequently filed a motion to dismiss on
 
the ground that the district court lacked subject matter
 
jurisdiction over the case.13 Id. We determined that the
 
Moreses’ declaration did not comport with the requirements of
 DCRCP Rule 12.1 because it “merely assert[ed] that title was at
 issue,” but “fail[ed] to provide information as to the ‘source,’
 ‘nature,’ and ‘extent’ of this claim.” Id.
 
VII.
 
Similar to the affidavit in Aames, Respondent states
 
only in a vague and conclusory fashion that he owns the Property
 
13
 This court determined that “the Moreses’ declaration and 
subsequent motion to dismiss together [could] be construed as fulfilling the
[]DCRCP Rule 12.1 requirement that a defense to title be asserted in a‘written motion’ or ‘written answer[.]’” Aames, 107 Hawai 'i at 99, 110 P.3d 
at 1046. 
13
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
and that title was deeded to him by his family. In Monette, the
 
defendant’s affidavit indicated that she “inherited” the property
 “from her father, who had inherited the same from his father,”
 who “died in 1921.” 52 Haw. at 248, 473 P.2d at 865. By way of
 comparison, Respondent’s affidavit lacks any specificity with
 respect to the source of title.
 
As to the nature of his claim, Respondent asserts in
 
his affidavit that he has a deed to the Property. However,
 Respondent’s affidavit does not describe the contents of the deed
 or the type of deed he acquired. In Monette, because the
 defendant’s affidavit specified that she was claiming the
 property on behalf of herself and her five brothers, and that the
 property had been inherited from her father, who had passed away,
 the court was able to discern that she was claiming an interest
 “in fee simple” by virtue of “intestate succession.” Id. Here,
 
there is no information regarding the nature of the title claimed
 by Respondent.
 
Finally, Respondent’s affidavit also lacks detail or
 
information regarding the extent of title claimed. In Monette,
 in addition to asserting in her affidavit that she was claiming
 ownership in the property for herself and her brothers, the
 affidavit indicated that she had “five brothers[.]” Id. It
 
could be deduced from the foregoing facts that the defendant was
 claiming an undivided one-sixth interest in the title to the
 property. There is no information in Respondent’s affidavit from
 
14
         
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
which the extent of his interest may be reasonably discerned. As
 
indicated, a defendant may also include in the affidavit “further
 particulars” to aid in “fully appris[ing] the court of the nature
 of [his or her] claim.” DCRCP Rule 12.1. 
Consequently, to fully apprise the court, a defendant
 
would need to provide some details regarding the basis for the
 title. This application of DCRCP Rule 12.1 is supported by cases
 construing the rule. See Monette, 52 Haw. at 249, 473 P.2d at
 
865 (noting that the following language applied to the case: 
“‘The affidavits . . . while very clumsily worded, . . . put in
 issue the title to the land involved and the district magistrate
 was thereby apprised of defendant’s claim of title[.]’” (Quoting
 Yanagi v. Oka, 24 Haw. 176, 180 (Haw. Terr. 1918) (ellipsis in
 original)); see also Harrison v. McCandless, 22 Haw. 129, 131
 (Haw. Terr. 1914) (concluding that “[t]he plea to the
 jurisdiction of the court, supported by the proper affidavit,
 raised a question of title”) (emphasis added). 
Respondent did reference having been “defrauded, duped,
 
coerced, and tricked” into engaging in transactions involving the
 Property, but without further detail, it cannot be ascertained
 how or whether the allegation has any bearing on title to the
 Property. Respondent’s bare assertion that he owned the Property
 was insufficient to establish that he continued to maintain a
 claim to title at the time the action against him had been filed. 
See Jellings v. Kaihe, 30 Haw. 160, 163 (Haw. Terr. 1927)

        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
(explaining that, if the agreement of sale had been rescinded by
 
consent of the parties and no longer in force, no claim of
 interest or title to the property could be predicated upon it and
 therefore, it was incumbent upon the defendants challenging the
 court’s jurisdiction “to show affirmatively by their affidavit
 that their claim of title was based on a contract that was still
 in force and effect”).

As elucidated by the foregoing, Respondent’s affidavit
 
was similar to the affidavit submitted in Aames, which this court
 deemed insufficient. Unlike the affidavit submitted by the
 defendant in Monette, Respondent failed to provide any detail or
 specificity regarding the source, nature, or extent of title
 claimed, or any other particulars regarding his claim. As such,
 the affidavit did not fully apprise the court of the nature of
 Respondent’s claim of title to the Property. Accordingly, the
 ICA erred in distinguishing Aames and concluding that
 Respondent’s affidavit was similar to the one presented in
 Monette and, therefore, sufficient. See Deutsche Bank, 2011 WL
 
1909111, at *2.
 
VIII.
 
Proceeding to Petitioner’s second question, the ICA
 
14
 In Monette , 52 Haw. at 249, 473 P.2d at 866, this court noted that
 
the requirement set forth in Jellings , that a defendant must have stated that
the agreement was in force when the plea to jurisdiction was entered, “appears
 
to have gone beyond the plain meaning of the rule[.]” However, because a
defendant must establish that title is in question, it would seem apparent
that the defendant would need to identify an interest in the property at the
time a defense under DCRCP Rule 12.1 is raised.
 
16
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
relied on Monette in concluding that the court could not consider
 
Petitioner’s quitclaim deed in this case. Monette explained that
 
the rule does not provide for the filing of counter-affidavits
 and the consideration of a counter-affidavit would be, in effect,
 a ruling on the question of title. 52 Haw. at 249, 473 P.2d at
 866. But, as Petitioner urges, Monette is distinguishable.
 
In that case, one of the plaintiffs “filed a
 
counter-affidavit in reply to the affidavits submitted by [the]
 defendants.” Id. (emphasis added). Once a defendant establishes
 
that title is in question, a court cannot consider evidence or
 arguments in rebuttal of the defendant’s claim to title, or
 evidence in support of the plaintiff’s claim to a superior basis
 of title because that would be for the circuit court to decide. 
Such arguments and evidence would plainly place title in issue
 and divest the district court of jurisdiction. Id. 
In contrast to Monette, Petitioner’s quitclaim deed was
 
not submitted to the court in “reply to” or to rebut Respondent’s
 affidavit but, rather, was attached to its complaint. This was
 not a response to the question of title raised by Respondent.
 Petitioner was required to plead entitlement to possession of the
 Property and could appropriately attach a copy of its quitclaim
 deed in support of its claimed ownership. Cf. Fang Hing v. O.
 
Yamaoka, 31 Haw. 436, (Haw. Terr. 1930) (stating that it is well
 established “that in ejectment a plaintiff must recover upon 
17
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
strength of his own title and not upon any weakness in the
 
defendant’s title”). 
Although Petitioner did not submit the quitclaim deed
 
as counter-evidence in this case, the court appears to have
 considered it in ruling on Respondent’s motion to dismiss. But,
 notwithstanding the court’s error in that regard, Respondent’s
 motion was properly denied inasmuch as Respondent’s affidavit did
 not comport with the requirements of DCRCP Rule 12.1, as
 discussed.
 
IX.
 
In order to raise a jurisdiction defense to
 
Petitioner’s complaint, Respondent needed to establish that title
 was in question, by way of an affidavit under DCRCP Rule 12.1. 
Because Respondent’s affidavit did not set forth the source,
 nature, and extent of title with particularity, and no other
 particulars were set forth so as to apprise the court fully of
 the nature of his claim, Respondent failed to establish that
 title was in question in this case.
 
X.
 
In light of the foregoing (1) Respondent’s affidavit
 
did not meet the requirements of Rule 12.1, and therefore, the
 court had jurisdiction over Petitioner’s ejectment action, and
 (2) the quitclaim deed attached to Petitioner’s complaint was not
 counter-evidence. Therefore, the June 7, 2011 judgment of the
 ICA filed pursuant to its May 17, 2011 SDO is vacated and the 
18
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
November 18, 2009 Judgment for Possession filed by the court is
 
affirmed.
