CIO (UPW) and a former administrator o f UPW’s Mutual Aid Fund 
trust (MAF), an employee benefit plan established to provide 
hospital and related benefits to UPW members and their families. 
In 1998, Rodrigues, as the MAF’s plan administrator, 
made six loans totaling $1.1 million to Best Rescue Systems, Inc. (Best Rescue) a startup company located in Florida.  Best 
Rescue never repaid the loans and in October 2003, the MAF filed 
a complaint in the United States District Court for the District 
of Hawai i (federal district court) alleging, inter alia, that 
Rodrigues was negligent in making the loans and had thus 
breached his fiduciary duties as plan administrator to the MAF. 
1The federal district court found that the MAF is an 
Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) plan under 29 
U.S.C. § 1002(1) and that Rodrigues breached his fiduciary 
duties to the MAF.  DeCosta v. Rodrigues, Civ. No. 03-00598 DAE -
LEK, 2008 WL 1815716, at *6, *12 (D. Haw. Mar. 20, 2008), aff’d 
sub nom. De Costa v. Rodrigues, 334 F. App’x 807 (9th Cir. 
2009). 
The federal district court held Rodrigues liable for 
making imprudent investments under ERISA and entered judgment 
against him for five of the six failed loans in the amount of 
$850,000. Id. at *14.

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
In 2008, Rodrigues filed a complaint in the Circuit 
Court of the First Circuit (circuit court) seeking that UPW 
indemnify him for the $850,000 plus attorneys ’ fees and costs 
incurred in defending the federal lawsuit on the grounds that 
his liability to the MAF arose from actions he took solely in 
his capacity as agent for UPW and/or that UPW ratified his 
actions. UPW responded that Rodrigues was not entitled to 
indemnification because he was negligent in making the loans, 
and his indemnification claims were preempted by ERISA. The 
circuit court agreed with UPW and granted summary judgment in favor of UPW. 
Rodrigues appealed to the Intermediate Court of 
Appeals (ICA) arguing that his state indemnification claims were 
not preempted under ERISA’s “implied conflict” doctrine because 
they did not “duplicate, supplement, or supplant” remedies 
provided by ERISA’s civil enforcement scheme. The ICA held that 
ERISA did not preempt Rodrigues’ indemnification claims but 
affirmed the circuit court, stating that “[b]ecause Rodrigues is 
responsible for his own conduct, he is not entitled to be indemnified for his negligent acts as a matter of law .” 
Rodrigues v. United Public Workers, No. 30286, 2014 WL 983024, at *12 (App. Mar. 13, 2014). 
Rodrigues’ state indemnity claim derives from the 
3
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
federal district court ’s conclusion that Rodrigues breached his 
fiduciary duties to the MAF Plan, an employee benefit plan under 
ERISA. Thus, we must enter the “ERISA preemption thicket” to determine whether Rodrigues’ state law claim survives 
preemption. Gonzales v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. , 901 F.2d 
446, 451-52 (5th Cir. 1990) (“Obviously, any court forced to 
enter the ERISA preemption thicket sets out on a treacherous 
path.”), superseded by statute on other grounds as recognized in  
Guidry v. Nw. Mut. Life Ins. Co. , 88 F. App’x 12, 13-14 (5th 
Cir. 2004). 
Rodrigues requested certiorari on the ground that the 
ICA erred in concluding that his negligence defeats his 
indemnification claim as a matter of law. We do not reach this 
issue because we hold that ERISA preemption, not his negligence, 
defeats Rodrigues’ state in demnity claims against UPW as a 
matter of law. 
II. Background 
A. Facts 
Rodrigues was the State Director of UPW from 1981 
until 2002. UPW is a labor union representing government 
employees as well as those who work in the private sector.  In 
July of 1984, UPW established the MAF.  More than 10,000 persons 
participate in the MAF. The MAF is funded entirely by 
4
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
contributions from UPW members, UPW employees, and its 
dependents; employers do not contribute to the MAF.  A majority 
of employee participants are employed by the government.  Although the MAF is a 501(c)(9) trust and is a separate legal 
entity from UPW, the MAF’s Board of Trustees (Board ) includes 
the President, Secretary-Treasurer, and the Vice Presidents of 
five UPW divisions: Private Sector, O ahu, Maui, Kaua i, and the 
Big Island. As State Director, Rodrigues was not a member of 
the Board; however, under the terms of the “Administrative 
Services Agreement” entered between UPW and the MAF Board, UPW 
agreed to “[r]eceive, collect, hold, invest and disburse all 
money payable to or by the [MAF]” through its State Director 
acting on behalf of UPW. 
Beginning in 1998, Rodrigues acted as the MAF plan 
administrator to make six loans totaling $1.1 million to Best Rescue, a startup company located in Florida.  Best Rescue never 
returned the money. On October 31, 2003, the MAF filed a 
complaint in federal district court, seeking recovery from 
Rodrigues for all of the MAF’s losses resulting from its 
investments in Best Rescue. 
B. Federal District Court Proceedings 
The MAF alleged the following counts in its federal 
district court complaint: (1) breach of fiduciary duty in

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
violation of 29 U.S.C. § 1104(a)(1)(A);2 (2) breach of fiduciary 
duty by co-fiduciary pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 1105;3 and (3) 
engaging in prohibited transactions in violation of 29 U.S.C. 
§ 1106(a)(1)(D).4 
2 29 U.S.C. § 1104(a)(1)(A) (2012) provides: 
(a) Prudent man standard of care 
(1) Subject to sections 1103(c) and (d), 1342, and 
1344 of this title, a fiduciary shall discharge his 
duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest 
of the participants and beneficiaries and — 
(A) for the exclusive purpose of: 
(i) providing benefits to participants 
and their beneficiaries; and (ii) defraying reasonable expenses of 
administering the plan[.] 
3 29 U.S.C. § 1105(a) (2012) states in relevant part: 
[A] fiduciary with respect to a plan shall be liable 
for a breach of fiduciary responsibility of another 
fiduciary with respect to the same plan in the following circumstances: 
(1) if he participates knowingly in, or 
knowingly undertakes to conceal, an act or omission 
of such other fiduciary, knowing such act or omission 
is a breach; 
(2) if, by his failure to comply with section 
1104(a)(1) of this title in the administration of his specific responsibilities which give rise to his 
status as a fiduciary, he has enabled such other 
fiduciary to commit a breach; or 
(3) if he has knowledge of a breach by such 
other fiduciary, unless he makes reasonable efforts under the circumstances to remedy the breach. 
4 29 U.S.C. § 1106(a)(1)(D) (2012) states in relevant part:  
   A fiduciary with respect to a plan shall not cause 
the plan to engage in a transaction, if he knows or should know that such transaction constitutes a direct or 
indirect--  . . .  
(D)
 transfer to, or use by or for the benefit 
of a party in interest, of any assets of the plan .. . . 
6
  
 
 
 
 
 
                      
   
  
 The terms “employee welfare benefit plan” and 
“welfare plan” mean any plan, fund, or program which was 
heretofore or is hereafter established or maintained by an employer or by an employee organization, or by both, to the 
extent that such plan, fund, or program was established or 
is maintained for the purpose of providing for its 
participants or their beneficiaries, through the purchase 
of insurance or otherwise, (A) medical, surgical, or 
hospital care or benefits, or benefits in the event of 
sickness, accident, disability, death or unemployment, or 
vacation benefits, apprenticeship or other training 
programs, or day care centers, scholarship funds, or 
prepaid legal services, or (B) any benefit described in section 186(c) of this title (other than pensions on 
retirement or death, and insurance to provide such 
pensions). 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
After a three-day bench trial, the federal district 
court entered its “Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.” 
The federal district court first concluded that the MAF is an employee benefit plan governed by ERISA pursuant to 29 U.S.C. 
5 § 1002(1),  and that it had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 
§ 1331, which grants the district courts of the United States  
original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the 
Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States. DeCosta, 
2008 WL 1815716, at *6-7.  
Second, focusing on Rodrigues’ activities rather than 
his title as UPW’s State Director, the court found that the  
evidence was “sufficient to establish by far more than a 
preponderance of the evidence  that [Rodrigues] exercised  
discretionary authority and control over the management of the 
[MAF’s] assets ”  in making the loans to Best Rescue. Id.  at *9.   
5 Pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 1002(1) (2012): 
7
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
   
 
 
 
  
 
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
The court additionally concluded that pursuant to 29 U.S.C. 
§ 1104, plaintiffs had demonstrated by a preponderance of the 
evidence that Rodrigues “clearly breached his fiduciary duties” with respect to five of the six loans made to Best Rescue. 
Id.  
at *11.  Specifically, the federal district court concluded that a prudent fiduciary would have done more before authorizing and 
recommending further investments with Best Rescue after 
Rodrigues’ first loan to the company. Id.  at *12.  The court 
also concluded that the actions of the MAF Board in relation to 
the failed investments did not make Rodrigues any less liable for his own actions. Id. The court held that Rodrigues was 
liable under ERISA for making imprudent investments and that he was liable for five of the six failed loans, which totaled 
$850,000. Id. at *14.  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals 
subsequently affirmed the federal district court’s judgment. De 
Costa
, 334 F. App’x at 810. 
C. Hawaii State Court Proceedings 
1. Circuit Court Proceedings 
On December 9, 2008, Rodrigues filed a “Complaint for 
Indemnity” in the circuit court, alleging that his liability to 
the MAF “arose solely from acts and/or omissions” committed by Rodrigues “in his capacity as agent of Defendant UPW and/or were 
authorized and/or ratified by the trustees of the [MAF] and/or 
8
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
  
   
   
                     
   ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
Defendant UPW.” Rodrigues sought indemnification from UPW in 
the amount of $850,000 plus attorneys ’ fees and costs incurred 
in defending the ERISA breach of fiduciary duties action. UPW 
filed an answer asserting multiple defenses, including ERISA 
preemption. 
Rodrigues moved the circuit court for partial summary 
judgment in his favor as to the duty/liability of UPW to 
indemnify Rodrigues for the loss he suffered in the federal 
district court proceedings.  Rodrigues argued that the 
underlying actions for which he was held liable under ERISA were within the scope of his performance of duties assigned to him by 
UPW. Rodrigues thus asserted that UPW was vicariously liable to 
the MAF for Rodrigue s’ actions, and also directly liable for its 
negligence in assigning him as the MAF’s administrator . 
Accordingly, Rodrigues contended that UPW had a duty to 
indemnify him for the federal district court judgment.  
In opposition, UPW argued that Rodrigues had no right 
of indemnity under ERISA and that ERISA preempted any alleged 
state law indemnity claim. The circuit court agreed with UPW; it concluded that Rodrigues’ indemnity claim was preempted by 
ERISA and entered summary judgment in favor of UPW.

2. ICA Proceedings 
6 The Honorable Karl K. Sakamoto presided.

   ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
On appeal to the ICA, Rodrigues argued that his action 
was not preempted under the doctrine of implied conflict 
preemption because his indemnity claim did not “‘ duplicate[], 
supplement[], or supplant[]’ remedies provided in ERISA’s civil 
enforcement scheme. ” He also asserted that his action was not 
expressly preempted by ERISA’s preemption clause. Rodrigues 
contended that his indemnification claim arose solely from his 
employment relationship with UPW, which was not an ERISA party 
in the underlying federal court action. Rodrigues thus argued 
that his indemnity claim was not preempted by ERISA’s express 
preemption clause because, 
(1) his claims [were] entirely independent of any ERISA 
duties or obligations; (2) adjudication of these claims 
[would] not involve the plan’s administration and the 
benefits provided; and (3) adjudication of these claims [would] not encroach on any ERISA relationship or have any 
impact on any ERISA plan or party. 
(Citation omitted). 
UPW argued that (1) under ERISA there is no right of 
indemnity for a breaching fiduciary; (2) Rodrigues’ state law 
indemnity claim was preempted by ERISA; (3) Rodrigues’ indemnity 
claim was premature because he had not suffered a loss; and (4) 
Rodrigues was an active wrongdoer, and accordingly, Rodrigues 
should “bear the loss. ” 
The ICA held that ERISA did not preempt Rodrigues’ 
indemnity claim; it reasoned that because Rodrigues’ “liability 
10
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
     
 
  
   
 
 
 
 
                     
   
  
  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
to the plan for breach of his fiduciary duties had already been 
established,” the resolution of his indemnity claims against UPW 
“[did] not raise questions involving the [MAF’s] administration and the benefits provided.” Rodrigues , 2014 WL 983024, at *8. 
The ICA also explained that Rodrigues’ indemnity claim 
did not supplement ERISA’s civil enforcement scheme because his 
claim was an independent cause of action: “UPW’s alleged 
obligation to indemnify derives not from the plan’s ‘particular 
rights and obligations,’ but rather, from the alleged duties UPW 
owed to Rodrigues by virtue of UPW designating Rodrigues as its agent to serve as a plan fiduciary.” 
Id. at *9. 
Recognizing, however, that the circuit court did not 
address whether Rodrigues’ negligence was a bar to his indemnity 
claim because it found the preemption issue dispositive, the ICA 
entered summary judgment on the alternative ground that his own 
negligence barred Rodrigues’ claim for indemnification.7 Id. at 
*10-12.  
III. Standards of Review 
A. Motion for Summary Judgment 
“
We review [a] circuit court’s award of summary 
7 The ICA concluded that it could “ affirm a judgment of the lower 
court on any ground in the record that supports affirmance. ” Id. at *10 
(quoting Canalez v. Bob’s Appliance Serv. Ctr., Inc. , 89 Hawai i  292, 301, 972 
P.2d 295, 304 (1999)
) (internal quotation mark omitted) . 
11
  
 
 
 
 
 
    
 
 
 
  
  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
judgment de novo under the same standard applied by the circuit 
court.” Garcia v. Kaiser Found. Hosps., 90 Hawai i 425, 429, 978 
P.2d 863, 867 (1999) (alteration in original) (citing Amfac, 
Inc. v. Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co., 74 Haw. 85, 104, 839 P.2d 
10, 22 (1992)).  “ Summary judgment is appropriate if the 
pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and 
admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show 
that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that 
the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. ” 
Amfac, 74 Haw. at 104, 839 P.2d at 22 (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).  
B. ERISA preemption 
Questions of federal preemption under ERISA are 
questions of law reviewable de novo under the right/wrong 
standard. Ditto v. McCurdy , 90 Hawai i 345, 351, 978 P.2d 783, 
789 (1999). 
IV. Discussion 
A. ERISA 
ERISA is “the product of a decade of congressional 
study of the Nation’s private employee benefit system.”   Mertens 
v. Hewitt Assocs., 508 U.S. 248, 251 (1993) (citing Nachman 
Corp. v. Pension Benefit Guar.  Corp., 446 U.S. 359, 361 (1980)).  
It “is a comprehensive statute designed to promote the interests 
12  
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
  
   
   
 
 
   
    
 
  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
of employees and their beneficiaries in employee benefit plans.” 
Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U.S. 85, 90 (1983).  Employee 
benefit plans covered under ERISA 
include pension plans as well 
as welfare plans such as the MAF, which provides hospitalization and related benefits for participating UPW employees and 
members, and their dependents. See Massachusetts v. Morash
, 490 
U.S. 107, 113 (1989). 
ERISA imposes various uniform standards for 
both 
pension and welfare plans. Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon,  498 
U.S.
 133, 137 (1990). As part of this regulatory system, 
Congress included “one of the broadest preemption clauses ever 
enacted . . . .” Evans v. Safeco Life Ins. Co.,  916 F.2d 1437, 
1439 (9th Cir. 1990).  
The ERISA preemption clause, ERISA 
§ 514(a), codified as 29 U.S.C. § 1144(a), states that ERISA “shall supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now 
or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan . . . . ” 29 
U.S.C. § 1144(a) (2012). “‘[S]tate law s’ include claims ‘based 
upon common law of general application ’” such as Rodrigues’ 
indemnity claim. See Garcia, 90 Hawai i at 431, 978 P.2d at 869 
(quoting Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, 481 U.S. 58, 62 
(1987)). 
Questions involving this clause are recurrent in 
state and federal courts. The number of ERISA preemption cases 
13
  
 
 
 
 
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
before the United States Supreme Court reflects the 
“comprehensive nature of the statute, the centrality of pension 
and welfare plans in the national economy, and their importance to the financial security of the Nation’s work force.” Boggs v. 
Boggs, 520 U.S. 833, 839 (1997); see also  
 California Div. of 
Labor Standards Enforcement v. Dillingham  Const., N.A. Inc., 519 
U.S. 316, 334-35 (1997) (Scalia, J., concurring) (“Since ER ISA 
was enacted in 1974, this Court has accepted certiorari in, and 
decided, no less than 14 cases to resolve conflicts in the 
Courts of Appeals regarding ERISA pre-emption of various sorts of state law. The rate of acceptance, moreover, has not 
diminished . . . .”  (footnote omitted)).   
“[D]eveloping a rule to identify whether ERISA ”  
expressly preempts a state law based on the “relate to” language 
has “bedeviled the Supreme Court  ”  and other federal courts.  See  
Dishman v. UNUM Life Ins. Co. of Am., 269 F.3d 974, 980 (9th Cir. 2001) (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks 
omitted); see also   Gen. Am. Life Ins. Co. v. Castonguay, 984 
F.2d 1518, 1521 (9th Cir. 1993) (“It’s far easier to make ‘I 
know it when I see it’ decisions in this field than to come  up 
with a general rule, but we must nonetheless try.”). Attempts at construing the “relate to” language have yielded a number of  
tests. The Supreme Court has held that a law “relates to” an 
14

  
 
 
 
 
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
ERISA plan if it has a reference to or connection with such a 
plan.  Dillingham , 519 U.S. at 324.  The Court has concluded 
that a state law has a forbidden reference  where it “acts  
immediately and exclusively upon ERISA plan s”  and  “where  the 
existence of ERISA plans  is essential to the law’s operation.”   
Id. at 325; see also  District of Columbia v. Greater Washington 
Bd. of Trade, 506 U.S. 125, 130 (1992) (“Section 2(c)(2) of the 
[District of Columbia’s]  Equity Amendment Act specifically 
refers to welfare benefit plans regulated by ERISA and on that 
basis alone is pre-empted.”); Mackey v. Lanier Collection Agency & Serv., Inc., 486 U.S. 825, 828-30 (1988)   (preempting a law 
that specifically exempted ERISA plans from an otherwise generally applicable garnishment provision).   
In construing the “connection with” part of the test, 
however, the Court recognized that applying this term was no 
more help than trying to construe the phrase “relate to” in 
ERISA’s preemption clause. 
New York State Conference of Blue 
Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co. , 514 U.S. 645, 
656 (1995). The Court opined: “For the same reasons that infinite relations cannot be the measure of pre-emption, neither 
can infinite connections.” Id.   Accordingly, the Court held: 
“We simply must go beyond the unhelpful text and the frustrating 
difficulty of defining [the preemption clause’s] key term, and 
15

  
 
 
 
 
 
    ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
look instead to the objectives of the ERISA statute as a guide 
to the scope of the state law that Congress understood would 
survive.” Id. 
The Court reiterated
 Travelers ’  holding and provided  
further guidance in De Buono v. NYSA-ILA Medical and Clinical  
Services Fund,   520 U.S. 806, 813 (1997).   In De Buono, the Court 
explained that in its “earlier ERISA pre-emption cases, it had 
not been necessary to rely on the expansive character of ERISA’s 
literal language in order to find pre-emption because the state 
laws at issue in those cases had a clear connection with or reference to ERISA benefit plans. ”   De Buono, 520 U.S. at 813   
(citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Court explained, however,  that “ERISA’s ‘relates to’ language 
was [not] intended  to modify ‘the starting presumption that 
Congress does not intend to supplant state law.’” Id.  (quoting  
Travelers, 514 U.S. at 654); see also  John Hancock Mut. Life 
Ins. Co. v. Harris Trust & Sav. Bank, 510 U.S. 86, 99 (1993) 
(“[W]e discern no solid basis for believing that Congress, when 
it designed ERISA, intended fundamentally to alter traditional preemption analysis.”).  
Since then, the Court has consistently looked to the 
purposes and objectives of ERISA, and applied ordinary 
16
  
 
 
 
 
 
    
 
                     
   ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
preemption principles in its ERISA preemption cases.8 See, e.g., 
Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila,  542 U.S. 200, 209, 217-18 (2004) 
(preempting respondents’ state tort claim seeking to rectify a 
wrongful denial of  benefits because it would “pose an obstacle 
to the purposes and objectives of Congress” because it “conflict[ed] with the clear congressional intent to  make the 
ERISA remedy exclusive ”  (quoting Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 
481 U.S. 41, 52 (1987)) (internal quotation marks omitted));  
Boggs, 520 U.S. at  841 (“We can begin, and in this case end, the 
analysis by simply asking if state law conflicts with the provisions of ERISA or operates to frustrate its objects. . . .  
We need not inquire whether the stat utory phrase ‘relate to’

8 Justices Scalia, Ginsburg, and Breyer have urged the court to 
completely abandon the application of the “relate to” language in ERISA’s 
preemption clause and instead, apply ordinary principles of preemption in 
ERISA cases. In a concurring opinion joined by Justice Ginsburg, Justice 
Scalia opined that the Court’s “first take” of the preemption provision was wrong. 
Dillingham , 519 U.S. at 336 (Scalia, J., concurring). He explained 
that the “relate to” clause of the preemption provision was meant, “not to 
set forth a test  for pre-emption, but rather to identify the field in which 
ordinary field pre- emption  applies- namely, the field of laws regulating” 
employee benefit plans. Id.; see also  Egelhoff v. Egelhoff, 532 U.S. 141, 
153 (2001) (Breyer, J., dissentin g) (noting his “fear” that “failure to 
endorse” Justice Scalia’s approach in Dillingham, applying normal conflict 
and field preemption principles in ERISA cases,  would continue to produce an 
“avalanche of litigation” as courts struggled to interpret ERISA’ s preemption 
clause (citation omitted )  (internal quotation marks omitted)).

jurisprudence to say that we apply ordinary field pre-emption, 
and, of course, ordinary conflict pre-emption.”). 
This court has similarly endeavored to apply 
traditional preemption principles in our own ERISA cases, recognizing that state law may be expressly or impliedly 
preempted by federal law.
 See Garcia , 90 Hawai i at 430, 978   
P.2d at 868 (“[W]e are presented with the question whether 
Congress, in ERISA, expressly or impliedly intended to preempt 
the state law claims asserted  in Plaintiffs’ complaint.”).  
We have held that state law claims asserted by 
beneficiaries for improper processing of claims for benefits 
under an ERISA plan are expressly preempted by ERISA. Id.  at 
432, 978 P.2d at 870  .  This is so because “Congress clearly 
expressed an intent” that ERISA’s civil enforcement provision “be the exclusive vehicle for actions by ERISA-plan participants 
and beneficiaries asserting improper processing of a claim for 
benefits, and that varying state causes of action for claims  
within the scope [of these provisions] would pose an obstacle to the purposes and objectives of Congress.” Pilot, 481 U.S. at 
52.  Accordingly, based on “the clear expression of congressional intent that ERISA’s civil enforcement scheme be exclusive,” ERISA expressly preempts such state causes of 
action. Id. at 57;  see also AFL Hotel & Rest. Workers Health &

Welfare Trust Fund v. Bosque, 110 Hawai i 318, 324, 132 P.3d  
1229, 1235 (2006) (“ [S]tate law claims are expressly preempted  
where they rely on a person’s 
‘status as a beneficiary under the 
[ERISA] plan and ar[i]se from the administration of benefits 
under the plan.’” (alterations in original) (quoting Garcia , 90 
Hawaii at 433, 978 P.2d at 871)) .    
In addition to express preemption, this court has 
recognized that a federal statute can impliedly preempt state law under field or conflict preemption. Under implied field preemption, a federal statute preempts state law “when the scope 
of a statute indicates that Congress intended federal law to 
occupy a field exclusively  . . . . ” Freightliner Corp. v. 
Myrick, 514 U.S. 280, 287 (1995)  (citing
  English v. Gen.   Elec. 
Co., 496 U.S. 72, 78-79 (1990)).   Under implied conflict 
preemption, a federal statute preempts state law “when state law is in actual conflict with federal law.” Id.   Implied conflict 
preemption has been f ound “where it is impossible for a private 
party to comply with both state and federal requirements,  or 
where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and 
execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress. ” Id.  
(citations omitted)   (internal quotation marks omitted).   
We applied the doctrine of implied conflict preemption 
in a case involving a Hawai
i state statute.  In Hawaii  
19

  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
Management Alliance Association v. Insurance Commissioner,  we 
concluded that a Hawai i statute that provided  an independent 
review of an insurer’s denial of benefits and provided claimants 
the right to appeal that denial to the courts, allowing for a 
judicial determination of the claimants entitlement to benefits, 
was preempted. 106 Hawai i 21, 34-35, 100 P.3d 9  52, 965-66 
(2004).   We explained that in cases involving ERISA plans, such 
adjudication was in actual conflict with ERISA’s civil 
enforcement scheme, which the Supreme Court had concluded was intended to be exclusive. Id.   Accordingly, we held that 
ERISA’s civil enforcement scheme impliedly preempted the Hawai i  
statute under the doctrine of conflict preemption. Id.  at 29-
30, 100 P.3d at 960-61.   
The instant case is distinguishable from our previous 
cases because it does not involve a claim for benefits 
under an 
ERISA plan. Rather, the state law in the instant case is a 
common law indemnification claim based on Rodrigues’ allegations 
that UPW negligently supervised him in his role as an ERISA fiduciary and thus, UPW, not he, should be held liable for his 
breach of fiduciary duties under ERISA. Congress’ s intent to 
preempt such claims is not explicitly stated in ERISA’s language 
nor is it clear on its face that the claim “relates to” an 
20
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
employee benefit plan within the meaning of ERISA’s preemption 
clause. 
Notwithstanding, we hold that Rodrigues’ state law 
claim is in conflict with ERISA. Allowing Rodrigues to proceed with his state law claim would pose an obstacle to the purposes 
and objectives of Congress in enacting ERISA.   
See Boggs , 520 
U.S. at 844 (“Conventional conflict pre -emption principles 
require pre-emption . . . where state law stands as an obstacle 
to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and 
objectives of Congress.”  (quoting Gade v. Nat ’l Solid Wastes 
Mgmt. Ass’n, 505 U.S. 88, 98 (1992))  (internal quotation mark 
omitted)). Accordingly, Rodrigues ’  state law claim cannot 
survive under the doctrine of implied conflict preemption.  
B. Rodrigues’ State Law Claim is Preempted 
ERISA’s central focus is on the administr ative 
integrity of benefit plans.  Fort Halifax Packing Co., Inc. v. 
Coyne, 482 U.S. 1, 18 (1987).   “In enacting ERISA, Congress’ [s]  
primary concern was with the mismanagement of funds accumulated to finance employee benefits and the failure to pay employees benefits from accumulated funds. ”   Morash, 490 U.S. at  115.  
“Thus, Congress enacted ERISA  . . . to protect plan participants 
and beneficiaries from abuses and mismanagement in the 
administration of employee pension and benefit plans.” Hawaii

Laborers’ Trust Funds v. Maui Prince Hotel,  81 Hawai i 487, 49 3, 
918 P.2d 1143, 1149 (1996).  To this end, Congress “established 
extensive reporting, disclosure, and fiduciary duty requirements 
to insure against the possibility that the employee’s 
expectation of the  benefit would be defeated through poor 
management by the plan administrator.” Morash, 490 U.S. at 115; 
see also 29 U.S.C. § 1001  (2012) (declaring the policies of  
ERISA). 
The role of the ERISA fiduciary is critical to the 
administrative integrity of an employee benefit plan.  Congress 
recognized that “without standards by which a participant can 
measure the fiduciary ’s conduct,  [a participant] is not e   quipped 
to safeguard either his [or her] own rights or the plan assets.  ”   
Bird v. Shearson Lehman/Am. Express, Inc.,  926 F.2d 116, 123 (2d 
Cir. 1991) (citation omitted).  ERISA thus specifies stringent 
standards of conduct  and responsibility  on fiduciaries of 
employee benefit plans  to prevent potential fiduciary abuse.  
Pilot Life, 481 U.S. at 44; Coyne, 482 U.S. at 15.   
The duties imposed by ERISA are “the 
highest known to 
the law.” Johnson v. Couturier , 572 F.3d 1067, 1082 (9th Cir. 
2009) (quoting Howard v. Shay , 100 F.3d 1484, 1488 (9th Cir. 
1996)) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Congress chose to hold plan fiduciaries to this high standard “ to promote the 
22

  
 
 
 
 
 
    
 
  
  
    
 
 
 
   
  
  
  
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
interests of employees and their beneficiaries in employee 
benefit plans[.]” Id. (quoting Shaw, 463 U.S. at 90) (internal 
quotation marks omitted).  An ERISA fiduciary must “discharge 
his duties . . . solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries” of the plan, and “for the exclusive purpose[s] of 
. . . providing benefits to plan participants and their beneficiaries[,]” and “defraying reasonable expenses of 
administering the plan[.]” 29 U.S.C. § 1104(a)(1)(A)(i)-(ii).  
In further support of these rigorous fiduciary 
responsibilities, ERISA holds its fiduciaries personally liable 
for their breaches. Pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 1109(a), a 
fiduciary is personally liable for (1) “damages (to make good to 
[the] plan any losses to the plan resulting from each such 
breach)”; (2) “restitution ( to restore to [the] plan any profits 
of such fiduciary which have been made through use of assets of 
the plan by the fiduciary) ”; and (3) “such other equ itable or 
remedial relief as the court may deem appropriate, including removal of the fiduciary. ” Mertens, 508 U.S. at 252 
(alterations in original) (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 1109(a) (1988)) 
(internal quotation marks omitted). ERISA forbids agreements 
that relieve fiduciaries from such liability.  Under 29 U.S.C. 
§ 1110(a), “any provision in an agreement or instrument which 
purports to relieve a fiduciary from responsibility or liability 
23
  
 
 
 
 
 
    
      
  
     
 
 
 
   ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
for any responsibility, obligation, or duty . . . [is] void as 
against public policy. ” 29 U.S.C. § 1110(a) (2012). 
In this case, Rodrigues portrays himself not as a 
fiduciary, but as a mere agent performing duties at the direction of his principal, UPW. Rodrigues argues that UPW 
assigned him to invest the MAF funds, was aware of the MAF 
investments in Best Rescue, and acquiesced to them; thus UPW, 
not he, should be held liable for the $850,000 judgment imposed 
by the federal district court.  We disagree. 
ERISA’s regulatory standards and fiducia ry provisions 
were deliberately crafted to safeguard employees and “prevent abuses of the special responsibilities borne by those dealing 
with employee benefit plans” including “self-dealing, imprudent 
investing, and misappropriation of plan funds.” Coyne, 482 U.S. 
at 15 (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).  
Rodrigues was more than simply UPW’s agent and employee; he was 
the MAF’s administrator and an ERISA fiduciary. The federal 
district court concluded that the evidence was “sufficient to 
establish by far more than a preponderance of the evidence that [Rodrigues] exercised discretionary authority and control over 
the management of the [MAF’s] assets” in making the loans to 
Best Rescue. DeCosta, 2008 WL 1815716, at *9. Accordingly, 
Rodrigues’ actions with respect to the loans must be evaluated 
24
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
 
  
 
   
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
in his capacity as an ERISA fiduciary, not as an agent and 
employee with no discretion or control over the MAF’s assets. 
We also emphasize that contributions to the MAF are 
made by UPW members, UPW employees, and their dependents; contributions are not made by their employers. Thus, Rodrigues 
seeks indemnity, essentially a dollar for dollar reimbursement 
from UPW, for the liability he incurred for his mismanagement of 
the MAF funds, not simply from his employer, UPW, but from the 
very participants to whom he breached his duties. Under these 
circumstances, permitting Rodrigues’ state indemnity claim would undermine ERISA’s goal of protecting plan participants and 
beneficiaries from abuses and mismanagement in the 
administration of employee benefit plans. “In the face of this 
direct clash between state law and the provisions and objectives of ERISA, the state law cannot stand.” Boggs
, 520 U.S. at 844.  
We “are not free to change ERISA’s structure and balance” to permit Rodrigues to escape any liability for his imprudent 
investing. 
Id.  ERISA requires fiduciaries to be personally 
liable for damages to the plan resulting from a fiduciary 
breach. Accordingly, we hold Rodrigues ’ claim is preempted. 
V. Conclusion 
For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the circuit 
court corr
ectly concluded that Rodrigues’ indemnity claim was
