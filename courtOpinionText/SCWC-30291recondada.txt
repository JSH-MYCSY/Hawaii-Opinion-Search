CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
(ICA NO. 30291; CASE NO. AB 2005-503 (2-99-06569))
 
ORDER DISMISSING MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
  
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.,
and Circuit Judge Nakasone, in place of Acoba, J., recused)
 
On November 2, 2012, petitioner/claimant-appellant
 
Ropati J. Tautua filed a document asking the court to provide the
 
reasons his application of a writ of certiorari was rejected. 
Upon review of the document and the record, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that to the extent petitioner’s
 
request is a motion for reconsideration of the October 30, 2012
 order rejecting his application for a writ certiorari, it is
 dismissed. See HRAP 40.1(h) (“Neither acceptance nor rejection
 
of an application for a writ of certiorari shall be subject to a
 
motion for reconsideration in the supreme court.”). Moreover,
 there is no basis for clarification of the October 30, 2012
 order.
