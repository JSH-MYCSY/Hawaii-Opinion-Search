CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
(ICA NO. 30331; CR. NO. 06-1-2105)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and McKenna, JJ.)
 
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant Kim R. Massey’s
 
application for writ of certiorari, filed on September 27, 2011,
 
was filed more than ninety days after the filing of the ICA’s
 June 27, 2011 judgment on appeal. 
The application is untimely
 
and thus, this court lacks appellate jurisdiction. See HRS §
 
602-59(c) (Supp. 2010); HRAP Rule 40.1(a). Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the application for writ of
 
certiorari is dismissed.
 
DATED: 
Honolulu, Hawai 'i, November 1, 2011. 
Barry L. Sooalo,
on the application forpetitioner/defendant-appellant.
