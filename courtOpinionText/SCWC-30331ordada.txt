Upon consideration of Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant 
Kim R. Masseyâ€™s correspondence, which was received and filed on 
September 5, 2012, which we view as a motion for reconsideration of dismissal of the application for writ of certiorari and for appointment of appellate counsel, and the records and files herein, our rules do not allow for reconsideration of the acceptance or rejection of an application for certiorari. Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 40.1(h). Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion for
 
reconsideration of the order dismissing the application for writ
 of certiorari and for appointment of appellate counsel is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, September 14, 2012.
