SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.)  
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
  Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant Albert Villados, Jr., 
was arrested after a raid of his Maui home, which he shared with 
his girlfriend, Amy Bautista, and a roommate.  The raid 
uncovered a fanny pack containing methamphetamine in the living room common area.  Villados was convicted of possession of the 
methamphetamine and of paraphernalia.  During the jury trial, 
Bautista testified for the State about Villados’s prior drug Electronically Filed

 activity, including testimony that: Bautista was addicted to 
methamphetamine, and Villados had given her drugs from the fanny 
pack more than a dozen times; she saw Villados with an ounce of 
methamphetamine at the house; she saw him use digital scales to 
break down methamphetamine; and she saw him place the broken-
down methamphetamine into smaller plastic bags.   
  We agree with Villados that the admission of this 
testimony contravened Hawai‘ i Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rules 
404(b) and 403 because it was propensity evidence that suggested 
that Villados was a drug dealer.  The evidence suggested 
Villados was engaged in more culpable activity – drug 
trafficking – than the crime for which he was charged – mere possession.  Accordingly, the evidence presented a significant 
risk that the jury improperly convicted Villados based on their 
perception of his bad character, and his conviction must be 
vacated. 
II. BACKGROUND 
A. Circuit Court Proceedings 
  In 2008, Villados was charged in the Circuit Court of 
the Second Circuit (circuit court)
1 with one count of Promoting a 
Dangerous Drug in the Second Degree in violation of Hawai‘ i 
                     
1  The Honorable Shackley F. Raffetto presided.

 Revised Statutes (HRS) § 712-1242(1)(b)(i) (Supp. 2007)  and 
Prohibited Acts Related to Drug Paraphernalia in violation of 
HRS § 329-43.5(a) (2010).   The former charge related to the 9.35
grams of methamphetamine found in a fanny pack in Villados’s living room, and the latter related to the fanny pack itself; 
small plastic baggies, a cut plastic straw, and the eyeglass 
case found inside the fanny pack; and digital scales recovered 
from Villados’s bedroom. 32
 
1. Pretrial Rulings on HRE Rule 404(b) Evidence 
  Villados initially chose to represent himself, and during that period, the State filed a “Notice of Intent to Rely 
on Potential Rule 404(b) . . . Material.”  The notice stated 
                     
2  HRS § 712-1242(1)(b)(i) provides: “A person commits the offense 
of promoting a dangerous drug in the second degree if the person 
knowingly[] . . . [p]ossesses one or more preparations, compounds, mixtures, 
or substances of an aggregate weight of[] [o]ne- eighth ounce or more, 
containing methamphetamine[.]” 
 
3  HRS § 329-43.5(a) provided in 2008:  
 
It is unlawful for any person to use, or to possess with intent to use, drug paraphernalia to plant, propagate, 
cultivate, grow, harvest, manufacture, compound, convert, produce, process, prepare, test, analyze, pack, repack, 
store, contain, conceal, inject, ingest, inhale, or 
otherwise introduce into the human body a controlled 
substance in violation of this chapter.  Any person who 
violates this section is guilty of a class C felony[.] 
 
  Prohibited acts related to drug paraphernalia is now only a 
violation.  
  The jury was instructed that Villados was guilty of this count if 
he “did intentionally use, or possessed with intent to use, objects, to wit, 
a fanny pack, plastic packets, a cut straw, digital gram scales, and/or an 
eyeglass case, to store, contain, conceal, prepare, ingest, inhale, or 
otherwise introduce into the human body a controlled substance.”   ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 that the State would seek to introduce evidence that Bautista, 
who was living with and in a relationship with Villados at the 
time, saw Villados buy a Maui Built fanny pack in which he 
carried methamphetamine; that Bautista had observed Villados 
come home with an ounce of methamphetamine; that she had seen 
Villados break down methamphetamine into smaller quantities at 
the house; and that “whenever Bautista wanted to use crystal 
methamphetamine, . . . [Villados] would retrieve a packet . . . from his fannypack and give it to her[.]”   
  At the hearing on the notice, the court explained to 
Villados what HRE Rule 404(b) prohibited and the testimony that 
the State intended to introduce; the court indicated that “[its] 
opinion after reading [the notice] is that [the] evidence is 
admissible under [Rule 404(b)]” because “it shows intent.”  At 
the end of the same hearing, Villados asked for his standby 
counsel to resume representing him, to which the court agreed.   
  With the assistance of counsel, Villados filed a Motion to Reconsider regarding the 404(b) material in which 
Villados objected to all of Bautista’s testimony regarding his 
past drug possession or use, specifically:   
i. Any testimony that on prior occasions Bautista saw 
defendant Villados use a Maui Built Fannypack to carry 
packets of crystal methamphetamine; ii. Any testimony that Bautista observed defendant Villados 
come home with up to an ounce of crystal methamphetamine in 
his possession[;] 
iii. Any testimony that prior to traveling to Honolulu for 
Valentines Day in 2008, that Bautista observed defendant Villados possessing an ounce of crystal methamphetamine, ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
5 
 and observed him break down the ounce down into smaller 
packets of half gram quantities; 
iv. Any testimony that Bautista observed Villados break down one ounce quantities of methamphetamine into halves, 
one as a half ounce quantity kept in the original bag, and 
the other half into small quantities; v. Any testimony that Bautista observed Villados breaking 
down the drugs either on the kitchen counter, or on the 
dining room table using a digital scale; 
vi. Any testimony that after Villados would break down the 
drugs into smaller quantities, Bautista would observe Villados placing the packets into his Maui Built Fannypack; 
vii. Any testimony that whenever Bautista wanted to use crystal methamphetamine, she would let Villados know, and 
he would retrieve a packet of crystal methamphetamine from 
his fannypack and give it to her. 
 
Villados contended that State v. Steger, 114 Hawai‘ i 
162, 158 P.3d 280 (App. 2006), a factually-similar case upon 
which the State relied, was distinguishable.  Unlike the 
defendant in Steger, Villados did not face charges of 
methamphetamine trafficking or distribution – only possession.  Villados argued that “Bautista’s testimony of prior bad acts – 
regardless of any probative value – is inflammatory and unfairly 
prejudicial [such] that it should be barred by HRE 403.”  The 
court, “taking into consideration State v. [Steger] and the 
circumstances of this case, f[ound] that [the prior bad act 
testimony] is not . . . unfairly prejudicial, and so . . . 
den[ied] the motion.”   
2. Trial  The following evidence, as relevant to this case, was 
adduced at trial.  Maui Police Department (MPD) Officer Randy Esperanza testified to executing a search warrant for Villados’s person and home.  Bautista, Villados, and their third roommate, ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
6 
 Mandy Marinas, were detained outside while the police conducted 
the home search.   
  Officer Esperanza described finding a camouflage-
patterned Maui Built fanny pack behind the television in the living room.  He found a brown eyeglass case in the fanny pack; 
inside the eyeglass case were three plastic packets containing 
crystal methamphetamine.
4  Officer Esperanza also found a cut 
straw, empty plastic packets, and over $2,000 in cash in the 
fanny pack.  There were two ID cards wrapped in the money: 
Villados’s driver’s license and Bautista’s Hawai‘ i state ID.   
  On cross-examination, Officer Esperanza testified that 
Villados was not found holding or possessing the fanny pack and 
that the living room, where the fanny pack was found, was a 
common area accessible to everyone in the house.  The search of 
Villados’s person and car also did not yield any evidence, nor 
were there fingerprints found on the contents of the fanny pack.   
  Officer Esperanza also recovered digital gram scales 
from Villados and Bautista’s bedroom.  On cross-examination, he testified that it was clear the bedroom was occupied by two people and that Villados was not seen touching the scales.   
                     
4  Villados stipulated that the substance was in fact 9.353 grams 
(more than one- eighth ounce) of methamphetamine.   ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
7 
 In the kitchen, the officers found “a black and yellow 
torchlighter, glass bong, and . . . and an empty box for a . . . 
scale” matching the brand of the scale in Villados’s room.   
  The police also searched Marinas’s room, where Officer 
Esperanza testified to finding other paraphernalia, including plastic packets containing residue that tested positive for 
cocaine.  On cross-examination, Officer Esperanza admitted that 
there was methamphetamine in Marinas’s room as well.  Marinas was not charged.   
  Bautista testified that she was incarcerated at Maui 
Community Correctional Center because of her involvement with drugs in this case, and that she was recovering from addiction 
to methamphetamine and receiving treatment in Maui Drug Court.  
Villados was her ex-boyfriend, and she had agreed to testify 
against him as part of her plea deal.   
  Baustista testified that the eyeglass case found in 
the fanny pack belonged to Villados and that she went with Villados to Maui Built when he bought the fanny pack.  She 
further testified that the methamphetamine found in the eyeglass 
case belonged to Villados:   
[State:] . . . . [D]o you recognize what’s inside that 
brown eyeglass case? 
[Bautista:] Yeah. Q. What is that? 
A. It is methamphetamine.  It’s dope. 
Q. Methamphetamine? A. Yes. 
Q. Okay. And who did that belong to? ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
8 
 A. Junior.[5] 
Q. Junior? 
A. Uh-huh. 
Q. Okay.  Now, the day the police came into the house and searched the house, was this methamphetamine and this fanny 
pack and the brown eyeglass case, was that all belonging to Junior? 
A. Uh-huh. 
Q. And how about the money that was found in the photo? A. That’s Junior’s. 
. . . . 
Q. And the two IDs there, did one of them belong to you? 
A. Yes.  That was my ID, but I kept that one in my drawer 
because I couldn’t use it. 
Q. Okay.  So that is a State ID belonging to you? 
A. Yes. Q. Did you put it in the fanny pack? 
A. No. 
Q. Did you put drugs in the fanny pack? 
A. No. 
Q. Did you ever go inside the fanny pack? A. No. 
Q. After the defendant bought it, did he ever let you 
handle it? 
A. No. 
 
  The State then asked whether Villados had 
methamphetamine at the house: 
Q. Now, while you were living there, did you ever see him 
come home with methamphetamine? 
A. I seen him with meth at the house. 
[Counsel for Villados:] Your Honor, I need to renew my 
objection at this point.  404(b). 
THE COURT: All right.  Overruled. 
[State:] Okay.  You saw him with methamphetamine at the 
house? 
A. Uh-huh. 
Q. About how much did you see him with? 
A. It was like an ounce. 
Q. And did you ever see him break it down into smaller 
packets? 
A. Yes. 
Q. And did you see him -- where did you see him doing that 
at? 
A. In the table -- on the table in the living room, or like 
in the dining area. Q. And was he using anything to weigh it? 
A. Yes. 
 
  Villados objected again at this point on the basis of 
                     
5  Bautista referred to Villados as Junior.   ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
9 
 leading questions, which the court overruled.   
  Bautista testified that she saw Villados “break down 
the drugs” with the digital scale.  The State asked, “And when 
you saw him using the drug scales to break down the 
methamphetamine, did he place it into smaller plastic packets?”; 
she replied, “Yes.”  She further testified that she saw Villados 
put methamphetamine into the fanny pack.  When she was living 
with him, she was still addicted to methamphetamine, and she testified that Villados would give her methamphetamine from the 
fanny pack – this happened “[m]aybe twelve or fifteen times.”  
She testified that she used “my bong and my torch” found in the 
kitchen to smoke it.  Bautista further testified that Villados 
tried to convince her to “take the blame” for the fanny pack, 
both on the day of the search, and on multiple occasions 
thereafter.   
  Melissa Montilliano, “a good friend” of Bautista, 
testified for the State that Villados called Montilliano several 
times to check in on Bautista after Bautista was arrested and in 
custody.  Villados’s side of one of those conversations was 
recorded and played for the jury.  In it, Villados described 
asking Bautista to “just take the rap” because she would likely 
be sentenced only to Drug Court.  Villados asked Montilliano to 
ask Bautista to “hang on” and “stay solid” so that he could get 
out and bail her out.   ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
10 
   The State argued during closing that Villados 
knowingly possessed the drugs and paraphernalia.  As relevant to 
this case, the State pointed to Bautista’s testimony that 
Villados “would weigh the drugs out in the kitchen at times” to 
explain why the box to the scale was found there.  The State 
also noted that Villados was charged as a principal and/or an 
accomplice and argued that he was in fact the principal; 
“[Bautista] became the accomplice when she . . . used those drugs that came out of his fanny pack,” but “[s]he took 
responsibility” for that act.  As for the methamphetamine: 
[N]ot only was the fanny pack belonging to him, but 
she gave an explanation . . . that he was in knowing 
possession and he knew it was methamphetamine.  Of course 
he knows.   
The way he handled the meth, the way she described 
it, he is sophisticated.  He knows what it is.  He had 
scales.  He knew how to break it down.  He knew how to work with it.  He knew how to package it.  They found it 
packaged inside the brown eyeglass case.  Several empty 
packets, a cut sealed straw, that’s drug paraphernalia.  
That’s used as a scooper.  And three packets of 
methamphetamine, one in a very large amount of over eight 
grams, and two smaller amounts.  He knew how to package it.  
He knew how to break it down. 
When she wanted it, she had to go to him for it and 
he gave it to her, at least twelve to fifteen times is what 
she said. 
 
  The State emphasized that the jury’s job “is to 
determine whether or not the fanny pack was his, and knowing he 
possessed the fanny pack and the drugs, and the two scales.”   
  The State also argued Bautista was credible: 
“[Bautista] had the courage to come in and testify against her ex-boyfriend.  She was under his influence at that time.  He ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
11 
 was . . . in control of the drugs, even in control of how much 
she would receive from him, or drugs at that time.”  The State 
contended that the phone call in which Villados urged 
Montilliano to tell Bautista to take the rap for him evinced his 
guilt and “show[ed] a degree of sophistication on his part, how 
he is going to manipulate her[.]”   
  Villados argued in closing that there was reasonable 
doubt as to whether Villados knowingly possessed the drugs, pointing to the fact that the drugs were found in a common area 
of the house, Marinas was also found with paraphernalia in his 
room, and Bautista was an interested witness in light of her 
plea deal.  Villados also pointed out that both Bautista and 
Villados shared the bedroom where the scales were found.   
  During rebuttal, the State emphasized that in a 
picture of Bautista and Villados taken during a recent trip to 
Honolulu (which had been entered into evidence), Villados was 
wearing the fanny pack.   
3. Verdict and Sentencing 
  The jury returned a verdict of guilty on both the possession and paraphernalia counts.  Villados was sentenced to 
ten years for the possession count and five years for the 
paraphernalia count, to run consecutively.  Probation was also 
revoked in three other criminal cases – six additional counts in 
total – all involving promoting a dangerous drug (in the second ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
12 
 or third degree) and paraphernalia.  Villados received five 
years in prison for each count for which probation was revoked; 
four of those five-year terms ran consecutively to the sentence 
in this case, for a total sentence of thirty-five years’ 
incarceration.   
B. ICA Proceedings 
  Villados challenged the circuit court’s admission of 
the following prior bad act testimony: Bautista’s statements that she “saw Mr. Villados with an ounce of methamphetamine at 
the house, saw him use the two digital scales to break down the 
large amount of the drug, saw him place the drug into smaller 
plastic packets, and put methamphetamine into the fanny pack,” 
and “that she was addicted to methamphetamine and that Mr. 
Villados had gotten the drug from the fanny pack and given it to 
her ‘maybe twelve or fifteen times’ while they were living 
together.”
6   
 
 The Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) evaluated the 
prior bad act evidence under this court’s two-prong test: “Prior bad act evidence under HRE [R]ule 404(b) may be admissible when 
it is (1) relevant and (2) more probative than prejudicial,” 
citing State v. Cordeiro, 99 Hawai‘ i 390, 404, 56 P.3d 692, 706 
(2002).  First, as to the relevance prong, the ICA determined 
                     
6  Villados’s first appeal raised several other points of error as 
well, none of which are germane to his application for writ of certiorari.  ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
13 
 that Bautista’s testimony that “she saw [Villados] with 
methamphetamine at the house, and that she would see Villados 
break down the methamphetamine into smaller packets [which he] 
put . . . into the fanny pack . . . was probative of whether 
Villados had the knowledge of the methamphetamine and that he 
exercised dominion and control over it.”  The ICA rejected 
Villados’s argument that this evidence was offered “to portray 
[him] as a drug dealer”; because he was not charged with intent to distribute, this testimony was offered “to show that he 
knowingly possessed the methamphetamine.”   
  Under the second prong of the HRE Rule 404(b) 
analysis, the ICA held that the circuit court did not abuse its 
discretion when it determined that the probative value of the 
evidence substantially outweighed its prejudicial effect.  The 
ICA reasoned that the circuit court properly relied on the 
factors set forth in Steger, 114 Hawai‘ i at 172, 158 P.3d at 290: 
Here, Bautista’s testimony was highly probative of 
Villados’s knowledge and intent to exercise dominion and 
control over the methamphetamine.  The need for the 
evidence was heightened by the defense’s theory of the case at trial, i.e. that he was merely present in the residence 
and that mere proximity to the fanny pack is not enough to 
prove that he knowingly possessed more than one- eighth of 
an ounce of methamphetamine.  The potential prejudice argued by Villados, that the evidence “compelled the jury” to conclude that he was a drug dealer, was lessened by the 
fact that Villados was not charged with a distribution 
offense.  In addition, the court specifically instructed that the jury “must not be influenced . . . by passion or 
prejudice against the defendant” in reaching their verdict.   
 
(Ellipsis in original.) 
 ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
14 
 C. Supreme Court Proceedings 
  Villados now asks this court to consider whether HRE 
Rules 404(b) and 403 should have precluded the prior bad act 
evidence from being presented to the jury.7  Villados 
specifically challenges the admission of testimony that (1) Villados had retrieved drugs from the fanny pack and given it to 
Bautista multiple times; (2) Bautista saw Villados with an ounce 
of methamphetamine in the house; and (3) Bautista saw Villados break down large amounts of methamphetamine using digital scales 
and place the drugs into smaller packets.  Villados argues that 
this evidence, which suggested he was a drug dealer, violated 
Rule 404(b) because it was used to show his propensity for drug 
use or dealing.  Even if it was relevant for a permissible 
purpose, it should have been excluded because its probative 
value was substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice because 
the testimony implied that he was dealing drugs, a more serious 
offense than the possession offense with which he was charged.  Villados also argues that Steger is distinguishable: the 
defendant in Steger was tried for a drug dealing charge in 
                     
7  Villados filed a pro se certiorari application in this case in 
2012, which we dismissed for lack of jurisdiction; thereafter, he moved for 
relief under Hawai‘i  Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 40, arguing that he was 
entitled to refile an application for writ of certiorari.  Villados v. State
, 
148 Hawai‘i 386, 394, 477 P.3d 826, 834 (2020).  We agreed, holding that 
Villados must be permitted to refile his certiorari application in this case 
because ineffective assistance of counsel denied him the right for this court 
to review his direct criminal appeal on the merits.  
Id.  The instant case 
arises from the new application in Villados’s direct appeal. 
 ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
15 
 addition to possession, whereas Villados was charged only with 
possession.8 
  The State counters that because the drugs were found 
in a shared dwelling and the State was required to prove 
constructive possession, Bautista’s challenged testimony was 
relevant to show Villados’s knowledge of the crystal 
methamphetamine and his intent to exercise dominion and control 
over it, as the ICA held.  The State additionally points out that in Steger, the evidence of recent drug activity was 
relevant to show “knowledge and intent,” with respect to the defendant’s possession charge, as well as “to rebut the defense 
that [the defendant] was merely present in the apartment[.]”   
III. STANDARD OF REVIEW 
“Prior bad act” evidence under [HRE] Rule 404(b) 
. . . is admissible when it is 1) relevant and 2) more 
probative than prejudicial.  A trial court’s determination 
that evidence is “relevant” within the meaning of HRE Rule 
401 . . . is reviewed under the right/wrong standard of 
review.  However, a trial court’s balancing of the 
probative value of prior bad act evidence against the 
prejudicial effect of such evidence under HRE Rule 403 
. . . is reviewed for abuse of discretion.  An abuse of 
discretion occurs when the court clearly exceeds the bounds 
of reason or disregards rules or principles of law to the 
substantial detriment of a party litigant. 
 
State v. Behrendt, 124 Hawai‘ i 90, 102, 237 P.3d 1156, 1168

Fetelee, 117 Hawai‘ i 53, 62-63, 175 P.3d 709, 718-19 (2008)).   
                     
8  Villados additionally asks this court to review his sentence – 
specifically, the credit he received for time served.  Because we hold that 
Villados is entitled to a new trial and vacate his conviction, we do not 
reach the sentencing issue. ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 IV. DISCUSSION 
  HRE Rule 404(b) provides: 
Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible 
to prove the character of a person in order to show action 
in conformity therewith.  It may, however, be admissible 
where such evidence is probative of another fact that is of 
consequence to the determination of the action, such as 
proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, 
knowledge, identity, modus operandi, or absence of mistake 
or accident. 
 
  Under Rule 404(b), prior bad act evidence may be 
admissible if admitted for a relevant purpose, such as those 
enumerated in the rule, besides propensity.  “The list of 
permissible purposes in Rule 404(b) is not intended to be 
exhaustive for the range of relevancy outside the ban is almost 
infinite.”  Cordeiro, 99 Hawai‘ i at 414, 56 P.3d at 716 
(quotation marks omitted) (quoting State v. Clark, 83 Hawai‘ i 
289, 300, 926 P.2d 194, 205 (1996)).  “When evidence is offered 
for substantive reasons rather than propensity, a trial court 
must additionally weigh the potential prejudicial effects of the 
evidence against its probative value under HRE Rule 403.”  
Behrendt, 124 Hawai‘ i at 103, 237 P.3d at 1169.  HRE Rule 403 
provides in relevant part that otherwise-admissible evidence may 
nonetheless be excluded “if its probative value is substantially 
outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice[.]” 
  Villados challenges the admission of Bautista’s 
testimony that suggested he dealt, as opposed to merely 
possessed, methamphetamine.  He specifically challenges the ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
17 
 admission of the following testimony under HRE Rule 404(b): (1) 
that Villados had retrieved drugs from the fanny pack and given 
it to Bautista multiple times; (2) that Bautista saw Villados 
with an ounce of methamphetamine in the house; and (3) that 
Bautista saw Villados break down large amounts of 
methamphetamine using digital scales and place the drugs into 
smaller packets.  The State contends that it had to prove 
Villados knew of and intended to control the drugs in order to establish constructive possession because the drugs were found 
in a common area of a shared home.  Under the specific factual 
circumstances of this case, we agree that the prior bad acts 
associated with drug dealing here were relevant to prove 
Villados’s intent to possess the drugs found in the common area.  
But for the following reasons, we agree with Villados that the 
evidence was inadmissible because its probative value was 
substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect.  
  “The balance between the [Rule 404(b)] evidence’s 
probative value and prejudicial effect is ‘predicated upon an 
assessment of “the need for the evidence, the efficacy of 
alternative proof, and the degree to which the evidence will 
probably rouse the jury to overmastering hostility.”’”  State v. 
Martin, 146 Hawai‘ i 365, 383–84, 463 P.3d 1022, 1040–41 (2020) 
(quoting State v. Uyesugi, 100 Hawai‘ i 442, 463, 60 P.3d 843, 864

 the need factor[.]”  State v. Clark, 83 Hawai‘ i 289, 303, 926 
P.2d 194, 208 (1996) (citation omitted).  In this case, the 
State’s need was scant and alternative proof highly efficacious because Bautista testified directly to the fact that the prior 
bad acts only showed circumstantially: 
[State:] . . . . [D]o you recognize what’s inside that 
brown eyeglass case? 
[Bautista:] Yeah. 
Q. What is that? 
A.  It is methamphetamine.  It’s dope. 
Q. Methamphetamine? A. Yes. Q. Okay. 
And who did that belong to? 
A. Junior. 
Q. Junior? 
A. Uh-huh. 
Q. Okay.  Now, the day the police came into the house and 
searched the house, was this methamphetamine and this fanny 
back and the brown eyeglass case, was that all belonging to 
Junior? 
A. Uh-huh. 
Q. And how about the money that was found in the photo? 
A. That’s Junior’s. 
. . . . 
Q. And the two IDs there, did one of them belong to you? A. Yes.  That was my ID, but I kept that one in my drawer 
because I couldn’t use it. 
Q. Okay.  So that is a State ID belonging to you? 
A. Yes. Q. Did you put it in the fanny pack? 
A. No. Q. Did you put drugs in the fanny pack? 
A. No. 
Q. Did you ever go inside the fanny pack? 
A. No. 
Q. After the defendant bought it, did he ever let you handle it? 
A. No. 
 
  In addition to Bautista’s direct testimony that the 
drugs belonged to Villados, there was also other admissible 
circumstantial evidence that Villados knowingly possessed the 
drugs.  Bautista testified that she went with Villados when he ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
19 
 bought the Maui Built fanny pack and eyeglass case, and the 
State introduced a photograph of Villados wearing the Maui Built 
fanny pack.  By contrast, the testimony that Villados had 
previously had large quantities of methamphetamine in the house 
and broke it down into smaller packets only circumstantially 
suggests that later-recovered drugs belonged to him.  Therefore, 
in light of ample other evidence supporting the inference that 
Villados knowingly possessed the drugs, the Rule 404(b) evidence was “unnecessary overkill[.]”  State v. Austin, 70 Haw. 300, 
309, 769 P.2d 1098, 1103 (1989). 
  Moreover, the nature of the challenged evidence was 
likely to “rouse the jury to overmastering hostility.”  Martin, 
146 Hawai‘ i at 383-84, 463 P.3d at 1040-41 (citation omitted).  
Respectfully, we disagree with the ICA in this case that the 
prejudicial effect of evidence “that he was a drug dealer[] was 
lessened by the fact that Villados was not charged with a 
distribution offense.”  Rather, in our view, that he was not 
charged with a distribution offense heightened the risk the jury 
would make the impermissible propensity inference because, as Villados argued, drug dealing is “viewed as reprehensible in the 
community at large” and “implicated him in far more sinister 
activity than mere possession.”

9  One juror submitted a question for Officer Esperanza that, while 
ultimately not asked on the grounds that it was irrelevant, at least suggests 
that whether Villados was a user or a dealer – and that the former was less ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
20 
 improper character inference that, “because [Villados] was a 
person of criminal character, it was likely that he committed 
the crime for which he was on trial.”  State v. Pinero, 70 Haw. 
509, 518, 778 P.2d 704, 711 (1989).  And indeed, because the prior bad acts were worse in kind than the crime for which he 
was tried, the “probability of a hostile reaction against 
[Villados]” was greater.  Id.; Behrendt, 124 Hawai‘ i at 108, 237 
P.3d at 1174 (“[Differences between the prior bad acts and 
charged crimes] are relevant considerations which could, 
depending on the circumstances, provide a basis for limiting 
such evidence or excluding it altogether[.]”); cf. United States 
v. Stout, 509 F.3d 796, 803 (6th Cir. 2007) (affirming the 
exclusion of prior bad act evidence when “the prior bad acts in this case were significantly worse than the acts charged”). 
  Additionally, during closing arguments, the State emphasized that Villados was “sophisticated” when it came to 
drugs, and that he controlled Bautista’s drug use: 
The way he handled the meth, the way she described it, he 
is sophisticated.  He knows what it is.  He had scales.  He 
knew how to break it down.  He knew how to work with it.  
He knew how to package it.   
. . . . 
[Bautista] was under his influence at that time.  He was 
. . . in control of the drugs, even in control of how much 
she would receive from him, or drugs at that time. 
 
                     
culpable than the latter – was on the jurors’ minds.  The proposed question 
was: “Upon what information was the warrant issued?  I.E. did the police 
believe the defendant was a dealer or was he just seen as a user?”

 See State v. Gallagher, 146 Hawai‘ i 462, 475, 463 P.3d 1119, 1132 
(2020) (explaining that the use of the prior bad act evidence 
during closing argument “likely exacerbated” the prejudicial effect). 
  Other factors to consider when conducting the Rule 403 balancing test include “the strength of the evidence as to the 
commission of the other crime, the similarities between the 
crimes, [and] the interval of time that has elapsed between the 
crimes[.]”  Behrendt, 124 Hawai‘ i at 106, 237 P.3d at 1172 
(quoting State v. Renon, 73 Haw. 23, 38, 828 P.2d 1266, 1273 
(1992)).  The State did not argue that Bautista must have 
possessed the seized methamphetamine because it was the same 
methamphetamine that Bautista observed on prior occasions – rather, the State’s argument was that methamphetamine in the house had previously belonged to Villados and so it must have on 
this occasion, too.  Accordingly, these factors have less 
probative value than they might under other circumstances.  Cf. 
Gallagher, 146 Hawai‘ i at 472, 463 P.3d at 1129 (“[A] close 
proximity in time and nature between the prior misconduct and 
the charged offense may also increase the likelihood that a jury 
will consider the previous conduct to conclude that the 
defendant has a propensity for committing such acts, which is a 
prohibited inference. . . .  [W]hen the evidence is not offered 
for a purpose for which similarity in time and nature is ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
22 
 probative, a close unity between the acts potentially weighs 
against admitting the evidence when it increases the chances of 
unfair prejudice.”).  As above, the prior acts were crucially 
different in that they involved conduct consistent with drug 
dealing, an offense viewed as more morally culpable than the 
mere possession charge for which he was tried.   
  The parties have repeatedly pointed to the ICA opinion in State v. Steger as central to the issues in this case.  
Steger also involved a drug raid of a home in which three 
people, including the defendant, lived.  114 Hawai‘ i at 165, 158 
P.3d at 283.  The police found methamphetamine in a common area, along with a bag containing Steger’s ID and almost $3,000 in cash.  Id.  Additionally, other drugs, paraphernalia, and a 
pistol were found in the kitchen alongside Steger’s cell phone and laptop.  Id.  Steger was charged with several counts of drug 
possession and distribution.  Id. at 164, 158 P.3d at 282.  At 
trial, one of Steger’s roommates, Cruz, testified about her 
observation of Steger’s drug-related activities during the two-
month period preceding the execution of the search warrant, when she lived with Steger:   
Among other things, Cruz testified that during this time 
period, she saw Steger package crystal methamphetamine into 
plastic packets and sell crystal methamphetamine out of his 
truck.  She also saw quantities of crystal methamphetamine 
in the apartment that were consistent with the approximately four ounces seized by the police.  Cruz 
testified that Steger obtained crystal methamphetamine and 
Ecstasy through packages sent in the mail.  She recounted 
one incident in which Steger, in her presence, opened a ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
23 
 package he had just picked up from the post office.  The 
package contained baggies of crystal methamphetamine.  Cruz 
further testified that Steger made bongs, used crystal 
methamphetamine and Ecstasy in her presence, and gave her 
illegal drugs to use. 
 
Id. at 171, 158 P.3d at 289. 
  The ICA concluded that Cruz’s testimony did not 
violate HRE Rule 404(b).  First, the evidence “was directly 
relevant to proving Steger’s knowledge and intent with respect 
to the drugs found in the apartment,” both because the State 
“was required to prove that Steger knowingly possessed at least 
one ounce of methamphetamine to establish the [possession] 
offense,” and because the State also had to “prove that Steger 
intended to distribute at least 25 tablets of Ecstasy[.]”  Id. 
at 172, 158 P.3d at 290.  The ICA held that Cruz’s testimony was probative of whether Steger had the “requisite criminal intent,” but did not distinguish between the possession and distribution 
charges.  Id.  The ICA also held that “the probative value of 
Cruz’s testimony regarding Steger’s other drug activities was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.”  
Id. at 173, 158 P.3d at 291.  In addition to being probative of 
Steger’s mens rea, “Steger attempted to place the blame for the [drugs] on his co-defendant,” the third roommate in the house, and so the prior bad act evidence “refute[d] his defense that he 
was merely present in the apartment[.]”  Id.  The ICA reasoned 
that Steger’s portrayal of himself at trial as a drug user in ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
24 
 order “to explain how he could be present in an apartment filled 
with drugs and yet not be responsible for the distribution 
quantities” found therein mitigated any risk of unfair prejudice 
from the jury’s general hostility to drug use.  Id.  Finally, 
the ICA determined there was “a substantial need for Cruz’s testimony” because “the other evidence of Steger’s knowledge and 
intent was circumstantial[.]”  Id.  
  As explained above, we agree with the ICA that prior 
bad acts associated with drug dealing may be relevant to prove 
the requisite intent both for possession and distribution under 
the specific factual circumstances presented by Steger and this 
case, in which the State must prove who possessed drugs found in the common area of a shared home.  However, with respect to the 
HRE Rule 403 balancing analysis, the circumstances in this case 
are meaningfully different than Steger.  Unlike the defendant in 
Steger, Villados was not charged with a drug crime requiring the 
intent to distribute, and the State’s need for the evidence here was not as pronounced as in Steger.  Mere possession often can 
be – and in this case was – established using less prejudicial evidence.  Moreover, Villados, unlike Steger, did not “inject[] 
his prior involvement with drugs into the trial by 
characterizing himself as a heavy methamphetamine user.”  Id.  
Thus, the prejudicial effect of the testimony was far more ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
25 
 pronounced in the instant case.  Accordingly, we do not view 
Steger as dispositive here.   
  Thus, we conclude that the circuit court abused its discretion when it determined that the probative value 
outweighed the prejudicial effect of the testimony that Villados 
had retrieved drugs from the fanny pack and given it to Bautista 
multiple times, that Bautista saw Villados with an ounce of 
methamphetamine at the house, and that Bautista saw him break it down into smaller plastic packets.  There is “a reasonable 
possibility that the error complained of might have contributed 
to the conviction.”  Gallagher, 146 Hawai‘ i at 481, 463 P.3d at 
1138 (quoting State v. Mundon, 121 Hawai‘ i 339, 368, 219 P.3d 
1126, 1155 (2009)).  Although substantial admissible evidence 
supported the key inference that the drugs belonged to Villados, there is a reasonable possibility that the jury “decide[d] the 
case on a basis unrelated to th[e] elements [of the offense]” – 
that is, the jury may have convicted Villados based on the 
unfairly prejudicial inference that he was a drug dealer and 
therefore deserved to be convicted.  Id. at 482, 463 P.3d at 
1139.  Villados is therefore entitled to a new trial. 
V. CONCLUSION 
  For the foregoing reasons, the ICA’s January 8, 2021 judgment on appeal is vacated.  The circuit court’s April 15, 2010 judgment of conviction is vacated, and this case is ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
