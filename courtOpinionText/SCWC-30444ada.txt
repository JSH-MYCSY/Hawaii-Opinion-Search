CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
JANUARY 21, 2015 
RECKTENWALD, C.J., NAKAYAMA, POLLACK, AND WILSON, JJ, AND
CIRCUIT JUDGE TRADER, IN PLACE OF McKENNA, J., RECUSED 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY RECKTENWALD, C.J. 
This appeal requires us to determine which tribunal–­
the Hawaiʻ i Labor Relations Board (HLRB) or the circuit court-­
3
  
                
 
 
 
   
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
had jurisdiction to resolve a labor dispute regarding the 
selection of a neutral arbitrator. 
The dispute arose out of a negotiation between the 
State of Hawaiʻ i and other governmental entities (collectively, 
“the State”) and United Public Workers (UPW) to renew and modify a collective bargaining agreement (CBA). Because the State and 
UPW could not reach an agreement, the HLRB declared an impasse 
pursuant to Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 89-11.  When the 
parties failed to resolve the impasse within twenty days, HRS 
§ 89-11 then mandated that they go through an impasse procedure 
culminating in arbitration. 
The parties agreed to a process by which they would 
select a neutral arbitrator. Unfortunately, they were unable to 
do so, and each side then filed a prohibited practice complaint 
accusing the other of undue delay and bad faith in carrying out the impasse procedure. The HLRB determined that both parties 
had committed prohibited practices by their wilful failure to 
complete the arbitrator selection process, and ordered the 
American Arbitration Association (AAA) to select the neutral 
arbitrator. 
The dispute then moved to circuit court, where the 
parties filed three separate cases challenging the actions of the HLRB. In one action, the UPW filed a motion to compel 
4
  
                
 
 
 
  
  
  
                                                           
  
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
arbitration; the circuit court denied the motion after 
concluding that the HLRB had exclusive original jurisdiction 
over the matter because it involved prohibited practices under 
HRS § 89-14.1 The other two actions challenged HLRB’s finding of 
prohibited practices and its ordering of the AAA to select the neutral arbitrator; the circuit court affirmed the HLRB’s 
rulings in both cases.
2 
On appeal, the UPW contended that the circuit court 
had jurisdiction over the dispute regarding the selection of the 
arbitrator under the Hawai i Uniform Arbitration Act, HRS chapter 
658A. The Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) disagreed, 
concluding that the HLRB had exclusive original jurisdiction 
under HRS § 89-14 since the dispute involved allegations of the 
prohibited practices and, to the extent there was a conflict 
between the jurisdictional provisions of HRS chapters 89 and 
658A, the former takes precedence. State v. Nakanelua,  132 
Hawaiʻi 492, 323 P.3d 136 (App. 2014).  The UPW challenges that 
ruling and other aspects of the ICA’s opinion. 
Thus, we must decide whether the HLRB or the circuit 
court had jurisdiction to resolve the dispute over the selection

Browning presided.

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
of the arbitrator. Although we conclude that the HLRB had 
jurisdiction under HRS chapter 89, our reasoning differs from 
that of the ICA. The arbitration at issue here was required by 
statute as part of the legislatively mandated process for 
resolving impasses in collective bargaining. In contrast, the 
provisions of HRS chapter 658A apply to situations in which the 
parties voluntarily agree to engage in arbitration. Thus, HRS 
chapter 658A is simply not applicable to this case, and it is 
not necessary to determine whether the HLRB’s jurisdiction takes precedence over that of the circuit court. 
Except as noted below, we otherwise agree with the 
ICA’s analysis. Accordingly, the judgment of the ICA is 
affirmed. 
I. Background 
The following factual background is taken from the 
record on appeal. 
A. Factual background 
UPW is the exclusive representative for Unit 10 
employees, who are “Institutional, health, and correctional 
workers[.]” HRS § 89-6 (2012). In 2008, UPW entered into 
negotiations with the State of Hawaiʻ i, the Hawaiʻ i Health 
Systems Corporation, the Judiciary, the City and County of Honolulu, County of Hawaiʻ i, County of Maui, and County of Kauaʻ i 
6
  
                
 
 
 
   
  Because mediation was unsuccessful, and the parties 
still had not resolved the impasse, on March 3, 2009, UPW and 
the State entered into the following memorandum of agreement 
(MOA), setting forth an alternative impasse procedure pursuant 
to HRS § 89-11(a)4: 
                                                           
    
 
 
 
 
    
 
            *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(collectively, the “State”) to renew and modify the Unit 10 CBA 
covering the period from July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2011. 
The parties could not reach agreement on the terms of 
the CBA. As a result, on February 2, 2009, the HLRB issued 
Order No. 2576, pursuant to HRS § 89-11(c)(2),3 declaring an 
impasse and appointing a mediator to assist the parties in resolving the dispute. 
3 HRS § 89- 11(c) (2012) provides, in pertinent part: 
An impasse over the terms of an initial or renewed 
agreement and the date of impasse shall be as
follows: 
. . . 
(2) If neither party gives written notice of an
impasse and there are unresolved issues on January 31
of a year in which the agreement is due to expire, 
the board shall declare on January 31 that an impasse 
exists and February 1 shall be the date of impasse. 
4 HRS § 89- 11(a) (2012) provides that: 
A public employer and an exclusive representative may
enter, at any time, into a written agreement setting 
forth an alternate impasse procedure culminating in
an arbitration decision pursuant to subsection (f), 
to be invoked in the event of an impasse over the
terms of an initial or renewed agreement. 
The 
alternate impasse procedure shall specify whether the parties desire an arbitrator or arbitration panel,

Pursuant to subsection 89- 11(a), Hawaii  Revised 
Statutes; the Union and the Employer agree to the
following alternate impasse procedure for the
successor collective bargaining agreements, effective
July 1, 2009, covering employees in bargaining unit

(Emphasis in original). 
As indicated in the MOA, HLRB would request a list of 
arbitrators from the AAA. From this list, the parties were to 
select a three-member arbitration panel that would consist of an arbitrator chosen by each of the parties and a “neutral 
arbitrator” selected by mutual agreement of the parties. If the 
parties could not select the neutral arbitrator by July 6, 2009, 
the HLRB would request the AAA to provide a list of five 
arbitrators, then the parties would alternate striking names 
from the list and designate the last remaining name as the 
neutral arbitrator. UPW and the State designated Clifford Uwaine and Stanley Shiraki, respectively, as arbitrators. On 
July 15, 2009, the AAA provided a list of five potential neutral 
arbitrators. The deadline to select the neutral arbitrator was 
initially scheduled for five days after the AAA provided the 
10
  
                
 
 
 
  
  
  
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
list, but the parties mutually agreed to extend the deadline to 
July 28, 2009. 
In a July 29, 2009 letter to the HLRB, Laderta, the 
State’s representative, alleged that she had attempted on 
numerous occasions from July 15, 2009 until July 28, 2009 to 
contact UPW’s representative, Nakanelua, regarding the selection 
of the neutral arbitrator, but Nakanelua never returned her 
calls. The day before Laderta’s letter, Herbert Takahashi, 
counsel for UPW, wrote to the State indicating that he represented UPW in the selection process and requested that the 
State stop its attempts to contact Nakanelua. 
In response, on July 31, 2009, James Halvorson, deputy 
attorney general, wrote to Takahashi to inform him that 
Halvorson would be representing the “Employer.” Halvorson also 
requested that Takahashi call him immediately to begin the 
process of selecting the neutral arbitrator. 
On August 3, 2009, Takahashi wrote to Halvorson asking 
him to identify which “employer” Halvorson represented, and also asking for verification of Halvorson’s “authority to represent 
anyone other than Governor Lingle.” On August 6, Halvorson 
replied by letter that he represented the “employer in the 
upcoming Unit 10 interest arbitration” and that Takahashi should 
contact him to begin the selection process. The next day, in a 
11
  
                
 
 
 
   
  
  
 
                                                           
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
letter dated August 7, 2009, Takahashi stated that Halvorson’s 
August 6, 2009 letter was not responsive because it “does not 
indicate apparent or actual authority to act for the employer 
group.” 
On August 10, 2009, Halvorson requested the HLRB’s 
assistance because the “selection process has yet to proceed due 
to delays by UPW’s counsel.” 
Halvorson also indicated that the delay appeared to 
compromise the availability of the arbitrator eventually selected for the September 11, 2009 start date for the Unit 10 
arbitration.
5 The HLRB held a hearing on August 13, 2009, 
pursuant to Halvorson’s request, at which Halvorson proposed to initiate the striking of names, but Takahashi refused. The next 
day, Takahashi sent Halvorson a letter agreeing to the State 
striking first, but “[w]ithout waiving the UPW’s right to 
contest [Halvorson’s] authority to represent the ‘employer[.]’” 
The State struck its first name from the AAA list on 
August 18, 2009. UPW followed on August 20, 2009 by striking another name off the list. 
5 Included in Halvorson’s letter to the HLRB was an August 7, 2009
email from the AAA, stating that no appointment of an arbitrator had been
made, and that none of the five arbitrators would likely be able to
accommodate the September 11, 2009 commencement of the arbitration.  
12
  
                
 
 
 
   
  
  
 
  On August 26, 2009, Halvorson sent another letter to 
Takahashi stating: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
On August 21, 2009, the AAA sent an email to the 
parties, stating that it was setting an August 25, 2009 deadline 
for the parties to select the neutral arbitrator. The email 
warned that if the parties did not select a neutral arbitrator 
by the deadline, “the [AAA] shall administratively appoint an 
Arbitrator at that time.” 
On August 24, 2009, Takahashi replied to the AAA, 
stating that UPW objected to the August 25, 2009 deadline 
because the MOA “does not authorize AAA to administratively appoint an arbitrator.” Takahashi added, “There is currently a 
dispute over who the ‘employer’ is, and whether the selection of arbitrators by the State . . . is improper.” 
As you know, the March 3, 2009 MOA concerning the
alternate impasse procedure between the UPW and the
Employer provides that the selection and appointment
of neutral arbitrator shall  be made within 5 working
days after receipt of AAA list. Since July 15, 2009, 
the Chief Negotiator for the public employer made
several attempts to contact the UPW State Director tono avail. 
On July 28, 2009, you wrote a letter informing the 
employer that you would be making the selection of
the neutral arbitrator. However, to date you havestonewalled any attempts to select an arbitrator.
Despite my letter to you on July31, 2009 requesting 
the selection of an arbitrator, and another letterdated August 6, 2009, as well as request for 
assistance made to the Board and a subsequent meeting
at the Board on August 13, 2009, and me making the 
first strike on August 18, 2009, you have delayed the 
selection by taking one week to make your strike. 
13
  
                
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  The next day, Takahashi sent a response letter to the 
State. He warned that, “If you refuse to exercise the ‘second’ 
strike forthwith appropriate relief will be sought for willful 
violation of the memorandum of agreement.” 
  
 
  On August 24, 2009, the State filed a prohibited 
practice complaint (CU-10-278) in the HLRB, alleging that UPW 
had “willfully violated HRS Section 89-13(b)(4)[6] by refusing to 
comply with” the alternate impasse procedure agreed to pursuant 
                                                           
     
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
In addition, your August 24, 2009, letter to AAA
shows you are not acting in good faith when youinformed AAA about a dispute over who the “employer”
is and whether my selection of the arbitrator is
improper. 
Your conduct throughout this process shows bad faith.
Accordingly, we take the position that UPW waived its
right to participate in the interest arbitration, or 
at a minimum UPW has waived its right to strike names
from the list of arbitrators and the Employer is
authorized to unilaterally select from the list of neutral arbitrator [sic]. We are seeking this relief
through a prohibited practice complaint I filed on
Monday, August 24, 2009. 
B. Prohibited practice complaints in the HLRB 
6 HRS § 89- 13 (2012) lists various prohibited practices, including: 
(b) It shall be a prohibited practice for a publicemployee or for an employee organization or its
designated agent wilfully to: 
. . . 
(3) Refuse to participate in good faith in the
mediation and arbitration procedures set forth in
section 89- 11; [or] 
(4) Refuse or fail to comply with any provision of
this chapter[.] 
14
  
                
 
 
 
   
  
  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
to HRS § 89-11. The State sought an order declaring that UPW 
had waived its right to participate in the selection process and 
authorizing the State to unilaterally select the neutral 
arbitrator from the AAA list. 
On August 31, 2009, UPW filed its own prohibited 
practice complaint (CE-10-726), alleging that “on and after 
August 28, 2009 Laderta ha[d] wilfully refused to proceed with 
the striking process as required by paragraph 4 of the [MOA].” 
In its prohibited practice complaint case, the State 
filed a motion for interlocutory relief requesting a declaratory order that the UPW violated the MOA, committed a prohibited 
practice, and had waived its right to either participate in the 
interest arbitration set for September 11, 2009 or waived its 
right to participate in the selection of the neutral arbitrator. 
The State’s accompanying memorandum contended that UPW’s conduct 
was dilatory and amounted to bad faith. The State also requested that the HLRB dismiss UPW’s prohibited practice 
complaint against Laderta. 
On September 10, 2009, UPW filed a motion to dismiss 
the State’s complaint and in the alternative for summary 
judgment. UPW argued the State committed a prohibited practice 
in violation of HRS § 89-13(a)(8) by refusing to complete its 
second strike. UPW requested that the HLRB grant its complaint 
15
  
                
 
 
 
   
                                                           
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
as a matter of law, dismiss the State’s complaint, and compel 
the State to complete the striking process and proceed with the 
arbitral process under the MOA. 
The HLRB consolidated the complaints on September 16, 
2009. On September 25, 2009, the HLRB issued Order No. 2640. 
The order granted the State’s motion for interlocutory relief in 
CU-10-278. The HLRB first concluded that it had jurisdiction 
over the subject matter of the consolidated cases, pursuant to 
HRS § 89-14,7 because the controversies concerned prohibited 
practices. Next, the HLRB found that, “[t]o date, the parties 
have not selected the neutral arbitrator. Yet, since July 15, 
2009, the date of the list from AAA, the parties managed to find 
the time to” correspond with each other and file various 
pleadings with the HLRB and the courts. The HLRB thus found 
both parties had been responsible for the undue delay in the 
selection of the neutral arbitrator.

Any controversy concerning prohibited practices may
be submitted to the board in the same manner and with 
the same effect as provided in section 377- 9; 
provided that the board shall have exclusive original
jurisdiction over such a controversy except that
nothing herein shall preclude (1) the institution of
appropriate proceedings in circuit court pursuant to
section [89- 12(c)] or (2) the judicial review of

   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The HLRB then explained that, because the State moved 
for interlocutory relief, the HLRB would decide the motion by 
analyzing whether the employer is likely to prevail at trial. 
Applying this analysis, the [HLRB] concluded that, “given the 
history of events regarding the interest arbitration procedure, 
the employer is likely to prevail on the merits that the UPW 
committed a prohibited practice by wilfully failing to comply 
with the . . . alternate impasse procedure authorized by HRS 
§89-11 and entered into by the parties.”  Adding that the 
balance of irreparable harm and public interest supported 
interlocutory relief because both parties’ wilful refusal to 
comply with the selection process put the interests of both 
parties and the Unit 10 public employees at risk, the HLRB 
thereby ordered the AAA to select the neutral arbitrator. Soon 
thereafter, the AAA selected Jonathan Dworkin as the neutral 
arbitrator. 
On February 9, 2010, the HLRB issued Order No. 2686. 
Based on the same findings it made in Order No. 2640, the HLRB held that both the State and UPW committed prohibited practices 
by their wilful refusal to complete the arbitrator selection 
process. As a consequence, the HLRB ordered “that a copy of 
this Order be posted by all parties on their website and in 
conspicuous places where employees of Unit 10 assemble, and to 
17
  
                
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
  
  
                                                           
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
keep the copies posted for a period of 60 days from the date of 
posting.” The HLRB imposed no other obligations on either 
party. 
C. Circuit court proceedings 
1. Case No. SCWC-30444 (Appeal from HLRB Order No. 2640) 
On October 23, 2009, UPW filed a timely notice of 
appeal in the circuit court of the HLRB’s Order No. 2640.8 In 
UPW’s opening brief, it argued that jurisdiction over the 
selection of an arbitrator rested with the circuit court pursuant to chapter 658A; the HLRB exceeded its statutory 
authority by ordering the AAA to select a neutral arbitrator 
because “[o]nce the parties have entered into an alternative 
impasse procedure which specifies how a neutral arbitrator is to 
be selected, the [HLRB] is powerless to implement any other 
requirement” besides what the MOA authorized; and the HLRB 
abused its discretion by granting interlocutory relief to a party that refused to abide by the MOA. 
In the State’s answering brief, it argued that 
pursuant to HRS § 89-14, the HLRB had exclusive jurisdiction 
over the State’s motion for interlocutory relief because it 
involved prohibited practices. The State explained that chapter 
8 The Honorable Karl K. Sakamoto presided. 
18
  
                
 
 
 
   
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
658A applies to “agreements to arbitrate,” but not an interest 
arbitration or prohibited practice under chapter 89. The State 
next contended that the HLRB did not exceed its authority when 
it ordered the AAA to select a neutral arbitrator because HRS 
§ 89-11 empowers the HLRB with broad discretion to assist the 
parties in resolving their impasse. The State added that the 
HLRB did not abuse its discretion in ordering the AAA to select 
the neutral arbitrator, given the parties’ inability to timely 
select the arbitrator themselves. 
The HLRB’s answering brief argued that the circuit 
court lacked jurisdiction over the appeal of Order No. 2640 because it was not a final order or an appealable preliminary 
ruling within the meaning of HRS § 91-14. The HLRB pointed to 
its later Order No. 2686 as the “final order” in the 
consolidated prohibited practices case. The HLRB also defended 
its choice of remedy in Order No. 2640 by pointing to substantial evidence that the parties wilfully delayed the 
alternate impasse process. 
On February 25, 2010, the State filed a supplemental 
answering brief to inform the court that UPW had moved to 
confirm and enforce the arbitration award in S.P. No. 09-1-0305, 
thereby rendering UPW’s appeal moot in Case No. 30444.

   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
On April 1, 2010, the circuit court issued its 
decision and order affirming the HLRB’s Order No. 2640. With 
regard to jurisdiction, the circuit court held that the HLRB had 
exclusive jurisdiction pursuant to chapter 89 because the matter 
involved prohibited practice complaints. The circuit court also 
held that the HLRB properly assisted the parties pursuant to HRS 
§ 89-11 in selecting the neutral arbitrator, given the parties’ 
failure to proceed with their alternate impasse procedure. 
The circuit court entered final judgment on April 1, 
2010. UPW timely filed a notice of appeal in the ICA on April 16, 2010. 
2. Case No. SCWC-10-166 (Appeal from HLRB Order No. 2686) 
In Case No. CAAP-10-166, UPW and the State timely 
appealed in the circuit court the HLRB’s Order No. 2686, which 
found that the State and UPW had both committed prohibited 
practices.
9 
In UPW’s opening brief, it insisted there was no 
evidence to support the HLRB’s finding that it committed a prohibited practice. UPW added that the State was the party 
that “wilfully” failed to adhere to the selection process when 
it refused to strike another name from the AAA list.

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The State’s opening brief also challenged the HLRB’s 
finding that the State wilfully refused to complete the 
arbitration process in a timely manner. The State explained 
that “the breach of the MOA by the UPW discharged and excused 
the [State] from any obligation to perform.” 
The HLRB filed answering briefs to both UPW’s and the 
State’s opening briefs. In the answering brief to UPW, the HLRB 
maintained that it correctly determined the union committed a wilful violation of HRS § 89-11; and that it was not an abuse of discretion for it to require the parties to post Order No. 2686 
on their website for sixty days. The HLRB also noted that the 
State was not excused from its obligation to perform under the agreement just because UPW materially breached the contract 
first. 
The circuit court issued its order affirming the 
HLRB’s Order No. 2686, and determining that the HLRB did not clearly err in finding both parties had committed prohibited 
practices. 
The circuit court entered final judgment the same day. 
UPW timely filed a notice of appeal. 
3. Case No. SCWC-30568 (Special Proceeding No. 09-1-0305) 
Meanwhile, on September 9, 2009, UPW filed a motion to 
compel arbitration in the circuit court (S.P. No. 09-1-0305

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
EEH).10 UPW asserted in its motion that the circuit court had 
jurisdiction pursuant to chapter 658A. 
On October 21, 2009, the circuit court issued an order 
granting in part and denying in part the motion to compel 
arbitration. The circuit court determined that “the [HLRB] has 
subject matter jurisdiction over a prohibited practice 
controversy pursuant to [HRS § 89-14].” Accordingly, the 
circuit court ruled that it “lacks subject matter jurisdiction 
over the issues presented regarding prohibited practices, and in the alternative, if this Court has jurisdiction, the Court finds 
under the primary jurisdiction doctrine the [HLRB] should first 
address the issues presented.” 
On January 14, 2010, Dworkin and the other two 
arbitrators issued an opinion and award. On February 19, 2010, 
UPW filed a motion to confirm and enforce the arbitration award. 
The circuit court issued an order on May 18, 2010, granting UPW’s motion to confirm and enforce arbitration award. The 
circuit court entered judgment the same day. 
On July 7, 2010, UPW filed a motion for show cause 
order and for civil contempt. The motion alleged that the 
May18, 2010 order incorporated the January 14, 2010 arbitration

award, which required UPW and the State “to meet and confer, 
without undue delay, and draft language for the 2009-2011 
agreement,” but that the State had refused to meet and confer 
with UPW since the May 18, 2010 order. UPW requested that the 
circuit court find the State in civil contempt and impose 
judicial sanctions, including civil fines, attorney’s fees and 
costs, and other appropriate relief. 
The circuit court denied UPW’s motion, finding that 
there was “no clear and convincing evidence that the [State] failed to comply with [the circuit court’s May 18, 2010 order].” 
However, the court ordered the State and UPW to meet and confer 
“to draft such language for the 2009-2011 Agreement as is 
necessary and appropriate to give effect to the interest 
arbitration award issued on January 14, 2010[.]” 
The State timely filed a notice of appeal. UPW timely 
filed a cross-appeal. 
4. Consolidated ICA Appeal 
In its opening briefs
11 to the ICA, UPW argued “[t]he 
Circuit Court erred on the question of whether the court or the 
[HLRB] has subject matter jurisdiction to determine a dispute 
over a selection of the neutral arbitrator to serve in the unit 
11 Because the parties filed multiple briefs in all three cases in 
the ICA, the relevant arguments are consolidated here. 
23
  
                
 
 
 
  
  
                                                           
    
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
10 arbitration.” UPW contended that subject matter jurisdiction 
over the selection of an arbitrator under an arbitration 
agreement rested with the circuit court under chapter 658A 
“because the chapter is both the more recent and a more specific 
statute on the selection process of an arbitrator compared to 
Chapter 89.” Additionally, UPW insisted that HRS § 658A-1112 
required the circuit court to compel arbitration according to the terms set forth in the MOA. UPW also argued that, “[b]y 
failing to grant the motion for civil contempt, the circuit court in effect withheld the enforcement of the arbitration 
award, contrary to the intent and purpose of [chapter 658A] and 
as such the circuit court erred as a matter of law.” Finally, 
UPW contended that “[t]he Circuit Court and the [HLRB] erred as 
a matter of law in finding ‘willful’ violations by UPW in Case 
CU-10-278[.]” 
In its answering briefs,
13 the HLRB argued the circuit 
court was correct in concluding that the HLRB had jurisdiction 
12 HRS § 658A- 11(a) (Supp. 2001) provides in relevant part that: 
If the parties to an agreement to arbitrate agree on
a method for appointing an arbitrator, that methodshall be followed, unless the method fails. If the 
parties have not agreed on a method, the agreed
method fails, or an arbitrator appointed fails or is
unable to act and a successor has not been appointed,
the court, on motion of a party to the arbitration
proceeding, shall appoint the arbitrator. 
13 The HLRB did not file any briefs in CAAP- 30568.  
24
  
                
 
 
 
  
  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
over the prohibited practice complaints. The HLRB then insisted 
that substantial evidence supported its prohibited practice 
determinations.  Regarding Order No. 2640, which directed the 
AAA to select the neutral arbitrator, the HLRB contended that it 
properly exercised its broad powers under HRS § 89-5(i) to 
assist the parties in resolving their impasse by ordering the 
selection of the neutral arbitrator. 
In the State’s answering briefs, it argued that the 
HLRB had exclusive original jurisdiction to resolve the arbitration dispute under chapter 89. The State also contended 
that the case was mooted by both parties’ acceptance of the 
interest arbitration decision. 
In a published opinion, the ICA first concluded that 
“the issues raised by UPW relating to the selection of the 
neutral arbitrator are moot because there is no live controversy 
between UPW and [the State] regarding the terms of the Arbitration Award[.]” The ICA noted that neither party 
challenged the award, and UPW even moved to have the award 
confirmed.  The ICA also determined that UPW’s challenge to the 
HLRB’s Order No. 2686 finding both parties had committed 
prohibited practices was moot. The ICA reasoned that the HLRB 
was no longer seeking judicial enforcement of the order, so 
25
  
                
 
 
 
   
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
neither party had any continuing obligations arising from the 
order. 
The ICA nevertheless held that, under the public 
interest exception to the mootness doctrine, it would address 
the following two issues: (1) “whether the HLRB or the Circuit 
Court had original jurisdiction to resolve the dispute over the 
selection of the neutral arbitrator”; and (2) “whether the HLRB 
exceeded its authority in issuing its order for interlocutory 
relief” directing the AAA to select a neutral arbitrator. 
The ICA held that the HLRB, not the circuit court, had 
jurisdiction over the selection of the neutral arbitrator. In support of this result, the ICA first concluded that the HLRB 
had exclusive original jurisdiction over the arbitration 
selection dispute because, under HRS § 89-14, the HLRB had 
jurisdiction over any “controversy concerning prohibited 
practices.” The ICA then proceeded to address UPW’s contention that the circuit court had exclusive original jurisdiction over 
the matter pursuant to chapter 658A. Although the ICA appeared 
to conclude that chapter 658A did not cover statutorily mandated 
arbitration, the ICA stated: 
[W]e need not resolve the question of whether HRS 
Chapter 658A applies to interest arbitrations under
HRS Chapter 89. This is because even if the MOA 
qualifies as an “agreement to arbitrate” that issubject to the provisions of HRS Chapter 658A, the
exclusive original jurisdiction granted to the HLRB 
over controversies concerning prohibited practices by 
26
  
                
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
HRS § 89— 14 would supersede HRS Chapter 658A.  HRS 
§ 89—19 (2012) explicitly states that the provisions 
of HRS Chapter 89 “shall take precedence over all
conflicting statutes concerning this subject matter 
and shall pre- empt all contrary local ordinances,
executive orders, legislation, or rules adopted bythe State[.]” To the extent that there may be aconflict between the jurisdictional provisions of HRS
Chapters 89 and 658A, Chapter 89 takes precedence 
over Chapter 658A. 
(Footnote omitted). 
Next, the ICA held that the HLRB did not exceed its 
authority in ordering interlocutory relief that differed from 
the arbitrator selection procedures set forth in the MOA. The 
ICA explained that the HLRB is granted broad statutory authority under HRS § 89-5(i) to determine how to resolve prohibited 
practice disputes. And, given the parties’ inability to timely 
select the neutral arbitrator, the HLRB did not abuse its 
discretion in using its authority to direct the AAA to do so. 
Finally, the ICA held that the circuit court did not err in 
denying the motion for civil contempt. The ICA explained that 
the motion involved a controversy concerning prohibited practices, thus, “the Circuit Court lacked jurisdiction to 
decide the Motion for Civil Contempt.” 
Accordingly, the ICA affirmed the circuit court’s 
April 1, 2010 Final Judgment in Appeal No. 30444, affirmed the 
circuit court’s May 18, 2010 Final Judgment but vacated its 
August 25, 2010 Order Denying Motion for Civil Contempt in

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Appeal No. 30568, and affirmed the circuit court’s November 10, 
2010 Final Judgment in Appeal No. CAAP-10-0000166. 
The ICA entered its judgment on appeal on April 4, 
2014. UPW timely filed its application for certiorari on 
June 3, 2014. The State filed a response on June 17, 2014. 
II. Standards of Review 
A. Subject matter jurisdiction 
The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law
that we review de novo under the right/wrong
standard. Questions regarding subject matter
jurisdiction may be raised at any stage of a cause ofaction. When reviewing a case where the circuitcourt lacked subject matter jurisdiction, the
appellate court retains jurisdiction, not on the
merits, but for the purpose of correcting the error
in jurisdiction. A judgment rendered by a circuit
court without subject matter jurisdiction is void.

107 Hawai
ʻi 178, 182, 111 P.3d 587, 591 (2005)). 
“Accordingly, a court’s decision to invoke the primary 
jurisdiction doctrine is reviewed de novo as well. If the court 
determines that the primary jurisdiction doctrine applies, the court, in its discretion, may determine whether to stay the 
litigation or dismiss without prejudice.” United Pub. Workers,

178 P.3d 538, 557 (2008)). 
III. Discussion 
A. 
	Although the ICA erred in concluding that the finding of
prohibited practices in Order No. 2686 was moot, the
finding was nevertheless supported by substantial evidence 
A threshold issue in the instant case is to what 
extent UPW’s claims are moot. The ICA determined the following 
issues were moot: (1) the HLRB’s Order No. 2686 finding that 
both the State and UPW committed prohibited practices; and (2) the selection of the neutral arbitrator. 
In general, “this court does not have jurisdiction to 
decide abstract propositions of law or moot cases[.]” Lathrop 
v.
 Sakatani, 111 Hawaiʻ i 307, 312, 141 P.3d 480, 485 (2006) 
(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted) (quoting Wong v. 
Bd. of Regents, Univ. of Haw.

29
  
                
 
 
204 (1980)). “The duty of this court, as of every other 
judicial tribunal, is to decide actual controversies by a 
judgment which can be carried into effect, and not to give 
opinions upon moot questions or abstract propositions, or to 
declare principles or rules of law which cannot affect the 
matter in issue in the case before it.” Wong, 62 Haw. at 394­
95, 616 P.2d at 204. Stated otherwise, 
 
   
  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
[t]he mootness doctrine is said to encompass the
circumstances that destroy the justiciability of a
suit previously suitable for determination. 
Put 
another way, the suit must remain alive throughoutthe course of litigation to the moment of finalappellate disposition. . . . The doctrine seems 
appropriate where events subsequent to the judgment
of the trial court have so affected the relations 
between the parties that the two conditions for
justiciability relevant on appeal--adverse interest and effective remedy--have been compromised. 
Lathrop, 111 Hawaiʻ i at 312-13, 14 1 P.3d at 485-86 (quoting Wong, 
62 Haw. at 394, 616 P.2d at 203–04). 
The ICA erred in concluding that the HLRB’s Order No. 
2686-–finding that UPW and the State both committed prohibited 
practices–-was moot. 
To establish that Order No. 2686 was moot, 
the HLRB points out that the order only required that a copy of the order “be posted by all parties on their website and in 
conspicuous places where employees of Unit 10 assemble, and to 
keep the copies posted for a period of 60 days from the date of 
posting.” Apart from this temporary obligation, the HLRB contends that Order No. 2686 imposed no other sanctions or 
30
  
                
 
 
 
   
   
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
directives for which this court could grant relief, or for which 
the HLRB could continue to seek enforcement, thus, the order is 
moot. 
However, the HLRB’s argument fails to take into 
account that an agency such as the HLRB can give consideration 
to its past decisions when determining future prohibited 
practice complaints. 
For example, in Sun Oil Co. of 
Pennsylvania v. N.L.R.B., 576 F.2d 553, 554-55 (3d Cir. 1978), a company petitioned for review of two decisions and orders by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) finding that the company 
committed unfair labor practices. The United States Court of 
Appeals for the Third Circuit denied the NLRB’s motion to 
dismiss the case for mootness. 
Id.
 at 558 n.3. The court 
reasoned that the case was not moot because: 
important collateral consequences may flow from the
[NLRB’s] order unless the unfair labor practice
violations are expunged . . . . Because the [NLRB]
often gives consideration to past misconduct in
determining current claims of unfair labor practices,the Company has a continuing, vital interest in a
clear pronouncement that they have committed no
unfair labor practices  in this instance
. 
Id.
 at 558 n.3. 
There is nothing to preclude the HLRB, like the NLRB 
in Sun Oil Co.,  from taking into consideration past decisions 
when determining current prohibited practice complaints against 
either UPW or the State. Indeed, under HRS § 377-9(d), the HLRB 
31

  
                
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
is authorized to assess a monetary penalty against an employer 
or employee based on past findings of unfair or prohibited 
practices. HRS § 377-9 (1993 and Supp. 2009) (“[A]n employer or 
employee who wilfully or repeatedly commits unfair or prohibited 
practices that interfere with the statutory rights of an 
employer or employees or discriminates against an employer or 
employees for the exercise of protected conduct shall be subject 
to a civil penalty not to exceed $10,000 for each violation.”). 
Although HRS § 377-9(d) specifically addresses employer-employee relations, and thus does not appear to apply to a collective 
bargaining representative such as UPW, the provision nonetheless 
suggests that it is permissible for the HLRB to consider past 
prohibited practices decisions within the context of a 
collective bargaining dispute such as the one in the instant 
case. The HLRB has not pointed to any law that prevents it from 
doing so. Although Order No. 2686 no longer imposes any directives, it still presents a live controversy for which a 
court can provide an effective remedy. Were this court to 
vacate Order No. 2686, thereby expunging the finding of a 
prohibited practice from both UPW’s and the State’s employment 
relations record, it would relieve them from having the order 
used against them in later prohibited practice determinations. 
In sum, the HLRB’s Order No. 2686 was not moot. 
32
  
                
 
 
 
   
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Although the ICA erred in finding the order was moot, 
we nevertheless affirm the ICA’s judgment on this point because 
the HLRB’s finding that UPW committed a prohibited practice is 
supported by substantial evidence. In Order No. 2686, the HLRB 
found that both parties had “wilfully failed to complete the 
arbitrator selection process” in violation of the MOA and 
chapter 89. Relevant to the HLRB’s finding, the parties did not 
meet their initial deadline to select the arbitrator by July 22, 
2009, and extended the deadline to July 28, 2009. The HLRB noted that during this time, the State’s representative had 
tried repeatedly to contact UPW’s representative to begin the 
selection process, but she never heard back from UPW’s 
representative. The parties further consumed unnecessary time 
by corresponding by letter. As a result of both parties’ 
conduct, neither UPW nor the State struck a name from the AAA 
list until August 18, 2009, and by August 24, 2009, the parties had only managed to strike only two names. The HLRB pointed out 
that, “Although the parties did not select the neutral 
arbitrator, since July 15, 2009, the date of the list from AAA, 
the parties managed to find the time” to correspond with each 
other and file various pleadings with the HLRB and the courts. 
Given this evidence, the HLRB did not clearly err in concluding 
that the parties could have completed the arbitrator selection 
33
  
                
 
 
 
    
  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
process if they wanted to, but, given the totality of the 
circumstances, the parties’ failure to do so was wilful. 
B. 	The ICA did not err in concluding that issues regarding the
selection of the neutral arbitrator were moot but fell within the public interest exception to the mootnessdoctrine 
The ICA correctly concluded that issues relating to 
the selection of the neutral arbitrator were moot. As the ICA 
notes, although the parties disagree about the selection of the 
neutral arbitrator, they do not dispute the terms of the 
arbitration award itself. Indeed, after Dworkin was selected as 
the neutral arbitrator by the AAA, and the arbitration panel 
issued its decision, UPW moved the circuit court to confirm the 
arbitration award. UPW then argued on appeal that the circuit court erred in denying UPW’s motion to find the State in civil 
contempt for failing to comply with the award. Insofar as both 
parties agreed to the arbitration award, the underlying 
selection of the neutral arbitrator was no longer a live 
controversy, thereby rendering it moot. Moreover, both the MOA 
and the 2009-2011 CBA have expired. It is therefore unclear 
what relief a court could provide regarding the selection of the 
neutral arbitrator. Accordingly, the ICA correctly concluded 
that issues regarding the selection of the neutral arbitrator were moot. 
34
  
                
 
 
 
   
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The ICA nevertheless concluded that the public 
interest exception to the mootness doctrine applied to two 
issues regarding the selection of the neutral arbitrator: 
“whether (1) the HLRB or the Circuit Court had jurisdiction to 
determine the parties’ dispute over the selection of the neutral 
arbitrator; and (2) whether the HLRB exceeded its authority in 
issuing the order for interlocutory relief directing the AAA to 
select the neutral arbitrator.” As a result, the ICA determined 
that it retained jurisdiction over those issues and addressed them in its opinion.  The ICA was correct, as discussed below.  
“When analyzing the public interest exception, this 
court looks to (1) the public or private nature of the question 
presented, (2) the desirability of an authoritative 
determination for future guidance of public officers, and (3) 
the likelihood of future recurrence of the question.” Hamilton,  
119 Hawaiʻ i at 6-7, 193 P.3d at 844-45 (quoting Doe v. Doe, 116 
Hawaiʻi 323, 327, 172 P.3d 1067, 1071 (2007)) (brackets omitted).  
The above factors support the ICA’s conclusion. First, it is clear that both issues are of a public nature. Each issue 
concerns a CBA between public employers and the collective 
bargaining representative of their Unit 10 employees. 
See 
Kahoʻohanohano v. State
, 114 Hawaiʻ i 302, 333, 162 P.3d 696, 727 
(2007) (holding that the subject appeal was of a public nature 
35
  
                
 
 
 
   
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
because the outcome would affect all state and county 
employees). Second, it is also clear that deciding the two 
issues would assist the HLRB in adjudicating future cases 
implicating similar issues, and would provide guidance to 
parties to comparable CBAs. Third, without a ruling on both 
issues, it is likely that similar disputes would arise in the 
future. For example, the issue of whether the HLRB or the 
circuit court has jurisdiction over an arbitration dispute has 
already come before this court in the past year. See Hawai i 
State Teachers Ass’n v. Univ. Lab. Sch. (hereinafter “ HSTA”), 
132 Hawaiʻ i 426, 322 P.3d 966 (2014).  Given all of this, the ICA 
properly considered the two issues under the public interest 
exception. 
C. 
	The circuit court lacked jurisdiction over the arbitration
in the instant case because chapter 658A applies to an
“agreement to arbitrate” and not to statutorily mandatedarbitration pursuant to HRS § 89-11(e) 
UPW argues the ICA erred in concluding the circuit 
court lacked jurisdiction to appoint the arbitrator. The ICA 
reached the correct result, i.e., that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction, but arrived at this result through incorrect 
reasoning. Specifically, the ICA correctly concluded the HLRB 
had exclusive original jurisdiction over the arbitration because 
it was a controversy concerning prohibited practices. However, 
36
  
                
 
 
 
  
  
 
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the ICA decided that it “need not resolve the question of 
whether HRS Chapter 658A applies to interest arbitrations under 
HRS Chapter 89” because, under HRS § 89-19 (2012), “the 
exclusive original jurisdiction granted to the HLRB over 
controversies concerning prohibited practices by HRS § 89-14 
would supersede HRS Chapter 658A.” As discussed below, because 
chapter 658A applies to an “agreement to arbitrate” only and not 
to statutorily mandated arbitration under HRS § 89-11(e), the 
circuit court did not have jurisdiction pursuant to chapter 658A. The ICA therefore erred when it relied on HRS § 89-19 to 
resolve whether chapter 89 or chapter 658A would control because 
chapter 658A was inapplicable. 
1. 	The HLRB had jurisdiction to determine disputes over
the selection of the neutral arbitrator 
Chapter 89, entitled “Collective Bargaining in Public 
Employment,” sets forth a specific statutory scheme that granted 
the HLRB jurisdiction over the impasse process in the instant 
case, including disputes regarding the selection of the neutral 
arbitrator. 
Chapter 89 provides that “it is the public policy of 
the State to promote harmonious and cooperative relations 
between government and its employees and to protect the public by assuring effective and orderly operations of government.” 
HRS § 89-1(b) (2012). One purpose of chapter 89 is “to provide
37  
                
 
 
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
a rational method for dealing with disputes and work 
stoppages[.]” Id. § 89-1(a) (2012). “[T]o administer the 
provisions of chapters 89 and 377,” and effectuate their policies, the legislature created the HLRB. 
Id. § 89-1(b)(3) 
(2012); see also HGEA, 124 Hawaiʻ i at 204, 239 P.3d at 8 (citing 
S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 597–82, in 1982 Senate Journal, at 
1202)), and granted it express powers to: 
“[r]esolve 
controversies under this chapter”; and “[c]onduct proceedings on complaints of prohibited practices by employers, employees, and 
employee organizations and take such actions with respect 
thereto as it deems necessary and proper[.]” HRS § 89-5(i) (2012). 
Under HRS § 89-14, the legislature also granted the 
HLRB “exclusive original jurisdiction” over “[a]ny controversy 
concerning prohibited practices[.]” Pursuant to HRS § 89-13, 
“It shall be a prohibited practice for a public employer [or 
bargaining unit representative] wilfully to: [r]efuse to 
participate in good faith in the mediation and arbitration 
procedures set forth in section 89-11; [r]efuse or fail to 
comply with any provision of this chapter; [or] [v]iolate the terms of a collective bargaining agreement[.]” HRS § 89­
13(a)(6)-(8); id. § 89-13(b)(3)-(5). 
38
  
                
 
 
  The legislature also set forth a specific procedure to 
be followed in the circumstances of this case, namely, an 
impasse14 between a public employer and bargaining unit 
representative. If the impasse involves critical bargaining units,
15 as it does here, HRS § 89-11 mandates that the HLRB 
“shall assist in the resolution of the impasse” through mediation during the first twenty days of impasse. HRS § 89­
11(e) (2012). If the impasse continues beyond twenty days of 
the date of impasse, the parties are statutorily required to enter into arbitration pursuant to HRS § 89-11(e)(2). 
 
   Section 89-11(a) further provides that parties “may 
enter, at any time, into a written agreement setting forth an 
alternate impasse procedure culminating in an arbitration 
                                                           
  
 
   
    
  
  
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
14 HRS § 89- 2 (2012) defines an “impasse” as a “failure of a public 
employer and an exclusive representative to achieve agreement in the course
of collective bargaining. It includes any declaration of an impasse under
section 89- 11.”  
Relevant to the instant case, under HRS § 89- 11(c)(2), “[i]f 
neither party gives written notice of an impasse and there are unresolved
issues on January 31 of a year in which the agreement is due to expire, the
board shall declare on January 31 that an impasse exists and February 1 shall
be the date of impasse.” Here, the HLRB declared the date of impasse between 
UPW and the State as February 1, 2009 after the parties initiated
negotiations in 2008, but could not reach agreement by January 31, 2009 to
renew and modify the CBA that was set to expire on June 30, 2009.  
15 In other circumstances, when an impasse exists between the public
employer and certain noncritical bargaining units, HRS § 89- 11 provides that 
the HLRB “shall assist in the resolution of the impasse” by requiring theparties to engage in mediation, with the HLRB promptly reporting to the
appropriate legislative body on the progress of the impasse procedures. HRS 
§ 89-11(d) (2012) .  
39
  
                
 
 
 
   
                                                           
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
decision pursuant to subsection (f)[.]”16 In addition, “the 
alternate impasse procedure shall specify whether the parties 
desire an arbitrator or arbitration panel, how the neutral 
arbitrator is to be selected or the name of the person whom the 
parties desire to be appointed as the neutral arbitrator, and 
other details regarding the issuance of an arbitration 
decision.” HRS § 89-11(a). HRS § 89-11(a) further provides 
that the “[HLRB] shall permit the parties to proceed with their 
procedure and assist at times and to the extent requested by the parties in their procedure.” In summary, although HRS § 89-11 
permits an alternate impasse procedure, the procedure still must 
culminate in arbitration consistent with subsection (f), with 
the HLRB specifically tasked with overseeing and assisting this 
process. 
Here, the parties set forth an alternate impasse 
procedure in their March 3, 2009 MOA, more than twenty days after the February 1, 2009 date of impasse. By the time the 
parties entered into the MOA, they were mandated by HRS § 89­
11(e) to enter into an impasse procedure that culminated in 
interest arbitration. The MOA reflects this fact, indicating 
16 Subsection (f) provides specific considerations that the
arbitrator(s) must take into account and include in the arbitration decision.
HRS § 89- 11(f) (2012) .  
40
  
                
 
 
 
                                                            
    
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
            *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
that it was entered into “[p]ursuant to subsection 89-11(a), 
Hawaii Revised Statutes[.]” The MOA further provided that the 
arbitration would be conducted according to HRS § 89-11(f), 
which requires the arbitration panel to expressly consider ten 
factors in reaching its decision.17 Moreover, whereas the 
17	 HRS § 89- 11(f) provides that: 
An arbitration panel in reaching its decision shall
give weight to the following factors and shall
include in its written report or decision anexplanation of how the factors were taken into 
account: 
(1) 	The lawful authority of the employer, including
the ability of the employer to use specialfunds only for authorized purposes or under
specific circumstances because of limitations
imposed by federal or state laws or county
ordinances, as the case may be; 
(2) 	Stipulations of the parties; 
(3) 	The interests and welfare of the public; 
(4) 	The financial ability of the employer to meet
these costs; provided that the employer’s 
ability to fund cost items shall not be
predicated on the premise that the employer mayincrease or impose new taxes, fees, or charges,
or develop other sources of revenues; 
(5) 	The present and future general economiccondition of the counties and the State; 
(6) 	Comparison of wages, hours, and conditions of
employment of the employees involved in thearbitration proceeding with the wages, hours,
and conditions of employment of other persons
performing similar services, and of other state
and county employees in Hawaii; 
(7) 	The average consumer prices for goods orservices, commonly known as the cost of living; 
(8) 	The overall compensation presently received bythe employees, including direct wage
compensation, vacation, holidays and excused

parties were mandated to enter into an impasse procedure, the 
HLRB had the authority and responsibility of overseeing the 
entire alternate impasse process, under HRS § 89-11(e) and the 
HLRB’s general powers, granted by HRS § 89-5. See HRS § 89-5(i) 
(“In addition to the powers and functions provided in other sections of this chapter, the board shall: . . . (3) Resolve 
controversies under this chapter; (4) Conduct proceedings on 
complaints of prohibited practices by employers, employees, and 
employee organizations and take such actions with respect thereto as it deems necessary and proper[.]”). 
When the parties in the instant case brought 
prohibited practice complaints alleging that the other party had 
wilfully violated the alternate impasse procedure in the MOA, 
the HLRB then had exclusive original jurisdiction over the

time, insurance and pensions, medical and

received;

parties’ dispute pursuant to HRS § 89-14. Under HRS § 89-14, 
the HLRB has “exclusive original jurisdiction” over “[a]ny 
controversy concerning prohibited practices[.]” According to 
HRS § 89-13, “It shall be a prohibited practice for a public 
employer [or bargaining unit representative] wilfully to: 
[r]efuse to participate in good faith in the mediation and 
arbitration procedures set forth in section 89-11; [r]efuse or 
fail to comply with any provision of this chapter; [or] 
[v]iolate the terms of a collective bargaining agreement[.]” HRS § 89-13(a)(6)-(8); 
id. § 89-13(b)(3)-(5). Each party 
alleged in its prohibited practice complaint that the other party wilfully violated HRS § 89-13 by refusing to comply with 
HRS § 89-11. The HLRB therefore had exclusive original 
jurisdiction over the issues regarding the selection of the 
neutral arbitrator, pursuant to HRS § 89-14. 
2. 
	The circuit court did not have jurisdiction under
chapter 658A and this court’s decision in HSTA  
UPW nevertheless argues that the circuit court was 
required to exert its jurisdiction under chapter 658A and this 
court’s decision in  regardless of whether the HLRB also 
had jurisdiction under chapter 89. As UPW notes, HSTA held that 
when a circuit court is faced with a motion to compel 
arbitration under chapter 658A, the circuit court is limited to 
asking if (1) an arbitration agreement exists between the
43  
                
 
 
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
parties; and if so, (2) whether the subject matter of the 
dispute is arbitrable under such agreement. UPW insists the ICA 
and circuit court in the instant case should not have addressed 
whether the HLRB or the circuit court had jurisdiction; instead, 
the circuit court should have limited its analysis to the above 
questions and granted UPW’s motion to compel because the MOA was 
an agreement to arbitrate. UPW’s arguments fail because chapter 
658A is inapplicable to statutorily mandated arbitration under 
HRS § 89-11(e). Accordingly, HSTA does not control the instant case. 
Chapter 658A was enacted by the legislature in 2001 as 
a codification of the Revised Uniform Arbitration Act (RUAA). 
See 2001 Hawai i Sess. Laws Act 265 §§ 1 and 5 at 810-19, 820. 
The drafters of the RUAA, the National Conference of 
Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, made clear that the RUAA 
was intended to apply to a specific type of arbitration, namely, 
when parties voluntarily agreed to arbitrate as an alternative 
to litigation. 
In their note and commentary to the RUAA, the 
National Conference of Commissioners explained that, “There are a number of principles that the Drafting Committee agreed upon at the outset of its consideration of a revision to the UAA. 
First, arbitration is a consensual process in which autonomy of the parties who enter into arbitration agreements should be 
44

  
                
 
 
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
given primary consideration,  so long as their agreements conform 
to notions of fundamental fairness.”

Commissioners on Uniform State Laws,

Arbitration, 58 UCLA L. Rev. 1189, 1255 (2011) (describing the purpose of the Revised Uniform Arbitration Act as encouraging the conditions under which arbitration will become a 
“credibl[e]” and “true” alternative to litigation) (quoting 
RUAA, §§ 6 cmt., 23 cmt. B (2000)). 
In this regard, several provisions in chapter 658A 
clarify that the chapter applies specifically to a voluntary 
“agreement to arbitrate” as opposed to statutorily mandated 
arbitration. 
For instance, HRS § 658A-3(a) (Supp. 2002) 
provides that chapter 658A applies to an “agreement to 
arbitrate.” Section 658A-26 (Supp. 2001) furthermore provides 
that “[a] court of this State having jurisdiction over the 
controversy and the parties may enforce an agreement to 
arbitrate,” and that the “agreement to arbitrate” confers 
jurisdiction to the circuit court to enter judgment on an award.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Indeed, the chair of the RUAA drafting committee has 
stated that, “Because RUAA only [sic] applies only where there 
is an agreement to arbitrate, arbitrations prescribed and 
required by state statute are not covered by RUAA. Thus, statutory labor arbitrations and lemon law arbitrations, and 
other such statutory arbitrations are not covered.” Francis J. 
Pavetti, The Revised Uniform Arbitration Act (RUAA) 2, 
http://www.uniformlaws.org/Shared/Docs/RUAA%20Briefing%20Sheet_v 
2_030508.pdf (last visited Dec. 30, 2014) (emphases added). 
The 
RUAA drafting committee chair thus drew a sharp line between 
statutorily mandated arbitration, and an agreement to arbitrate, 
and stated unequivocally that the RUAA applies to agreements to 
arbitrate but not to arbitration mandated by statute. 
Reiterating this point yet again, the committee chair stated 
that, “One of the cornerstones of party autonomy in RUAA is the 
requirement that RUAA only applies if there is an agreement to arbitrate.” Francis J. Pavetti, 
Why the States Should Enact the 
Revised Uniform Arbitration Act, 3 Pepp. Disp. Resol. L.J. 443, 444 (2003).

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
statutorily mandated arbitrations not requiring an arbitration 
agreement.” Id. at 444 n.4. 
In adopting chapter 658A, the legislature stated that 
its intent was to “codify[] the [Revised] Uniform Arbitration 
Act[,]” so as to advance the public policy of promoting 
“arbitration [as] a desirable alternative to litigation[.]” H. 
Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 189, in 2001 House Journal, at 1204. 
There is no indication in the legislative history that the 
legislature intended to expand the RUAA’s reach beyond cases involving agreements to arbitrate. Given the above, chapter 
658A does not cover the statutorily mandated arbitration at 
issue here, and thus is inapplicable in the instant case. 
The State argues that this court’s definition of a 
valid agreement to arbitrate also indicates that the statutorily 
mandated arbitration in the instant case is not an “agreement to 
arbitrate” conferring jurisdiction on the circuit court within the meaning of chapter 658A. In Douglass v. Pflueger Hawaii, 
Inc., 110 Hawaiʻ i
  520, 531, 135 P.3d 129, 140 (2006), this court 
held that a valid agreement to arbitrate consists of the 
following: “(1) it must be in writing; (2) it must be unambiguous as to the intent to submit disputes or controversies 
to arbitration; and (3) there must be bilateral consideration.” 
(Citing Brown v. KFC Nat’l Mgmt. Co.
, 82 Hawaiʻ i 226, 238-40, 921 
47
  
                
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
P.2d 146, 158-60 (1996)). The State contends that the MOA fails 
to satisfy the third requirement of bilateral consideration. 
“Under the preexisting duty rule, it is well settled that doing 
what one is legally bound to do is not consideration for a new 
promise.” Yerkovich v. AAA, 610 N.W.2d 542, 546 (Mich. 2000); 
see also Egan v. St. Anthony’s Med. Ctr.
, 244 S.W.3d 169, 174 
(Mo. 2008) (holding that a hospital’s duty to conform to health 
regulations is a preexisting duty that cannot furnish 
consideration for a contract); McCallum Highlands, Ltd. v. Washington Capital Dus, Inc., 66 F.3d 89, 93 opinion corrected 
on denial of reconsideration, 70 F.3d 26 (5th Cir. 1995) 
(“[U]nder the ‘pre-existing duty rule,’ an agreement to do what 
one is already bound to do cannot serve as ‘sufficient 
consideration to support a supplemental contract or 
modification.’”) (citation omitted). Here, the parties agreed 
to the MOA on March 3, 2009, after their statutory obligation to arbitrate was triggered by the passage of twenty days from the 
February 1, 2009 date of impasse. See HRS § 89-11(e)(2) (“If 
the impasse continues twenty days after the date of impasse, the [HLRB] shall immediately notify the employer and the exclusive 
representative that the impasse shall be submitted to a three-
member arbitration panel who shall follow the arbitration 
procedure provided herein.”). Thus, according to the State, 
48
  
                
 
 
 
   In response, UPW argues that the MOA was a voluntary 
agreement to arbitrate because, “If some bilateral consideration 
went into the overall MOA, then a requirement of bilateral 
consideration is satisfied” as to the agreement to arbitrate. 
UPW’s argument is unavailing because the parties’ agreement to 
other terms in the MOA does not convert a statutorily mandated arbitration into a voluntary agreement to arbitrate.
19 Notably, 
                                                           
  
 
 
 
 
            *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
under the preexisting duty rule, the MOA was not a valid 
agreement to arbitrate because there was no bilateral 
consideration. 
19 Cases in other jurisdictions have remarked on the significant
difference between voluntary agreements to arbitrate and statutorily mandated
arbitration. For example, in  Bd. of Educ. of Carlsbad Mun. Sch. v. Harrell, 
882 P.2d 511, 516 (N.M. 1994), the New Mexico Supreme Court stated, 
“Normally, arbitration is a process in which parties voluntarily contract to
select an impartial third person--an arbitrator--to whom they refer their 
dispute for a decision based on evidence and arguments before the arbitration tribunal, in order to obtain a speedy and inexpensive final resolution of thedispute. . . . When arbitration is statutorily mandated as the sole method
for resolution of a particular dispute, the arbitration is not consensual
even if a provision for such arbitration is incorporated into a contract.
Arbitration required by statute is compulsory; arbitration freely entered
into by contract is voluntary.” 
Id. at 517. 
As the New York Court of 
Appeals has observed, 
the essence of arbitration, as traditionally used andunderstood, is that it be voluntary and on consent.
The introduction of compulsion to submit to this
informal tribunal is to change its essence. It is 
very easy to transfer, quite fallaciously, notions
and principles applicable to voluntary arbitration to“compulsory” arbitration, because, by doubtful logic 
but irresistible usage, both systems carry thedescriptive noun “arbitration” in their names.  The 
simple and ineradicable fact is that voluntary
arbitration and compulsory arbitration arefundamentally different if only because one may,
under our system, consent to almost any restriction

none of the cases cited to by UPW involved statutorily mandated 
arbitration. Vickery v. Hastert,  No. 28586 (Haw. App. Feb. 13, 
2009) (mem.); Barker v. Golf U.S.A., Inc., 154 F.3d 788, 790 (8th Cir. 1998); Doctor’s Associates, Inc. v. Distajo, 66 F.3d 
438, 442 (2d Cir. 1995); Wilson Elec. Contractors, Inc. v. 
Minnotte Contracting Corp., 878 F.2d 167, 168 (6th Cir. 1989); 
Sablosky v. Edward S. Gordon Co., Inc., 535 N.E.2d 643 (N.Y. 
1989); Avid Eng’g, Inc. v. Orlando Marketplace Ltd., 809 So. 2d 
1, 2 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2001). Instead, every case cited to by UPW involved commercial contracts in the private sector, and 
specifically considered the issue of whether consideration in a 
commercial contract made an arbitration clause in the same 
contract enforceable. Moreover, as the court in Distajo 
explained, the reason that courts have held that a commercial 
arbitration clause does not have to be supported by independent 
consideration was because “recent decisions of the Supreme Court have consistently emphasized that the [Federal Arbitration Act] 
is grounded in a strong federal policy favoring arbitration. A

government, must accord with procedural and
substantive due process.

(N.Y.
 1970) (citation omitted); see  Harrell,  882 P.2d 511, 517 (holding that 
“[defendant’s] putative agreement to arbitrate was in reality a nonconsensualsubmission to a statutorily imposed requirement of mandatory arbitration”). 
50
  
                
 
 
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
doctrine that required separate consideration for arbitration 
clauses might risk running afoul of that policy.” 66 F.3d at 
453 (citation omitted). The reasoning behind the holdings cited 
to by UPW was to prevent parties from avoiding arbitration by 
arguing that their agreements to arbitrate lacked consideration. 
That reasoning is inapplicable here, where arbitration is 
required by statute and where both parties do not dispute the 
necessity of arbitration. Although consideration as to other 
terms in an agreement may make an arbitration clause in a commercial contract enforceable, it does not transform a 
statutorily mandated arbitration into a voluntary agreement to 
arbitrate. The MOA was an agreement to the terms of the 
alternate impasse procedure, but did not alter the underlying 
fact that arbitration was required by HRS § 89-11(e). 
In fact, UPW goes so far as to argue that, “whether by 
alternate procedures or statutory procedures, an agreement to arbitrate exists giving the circuit court jurisdiction under 
Chapter 658A, HRS.” UPW thus claims that, even if the parties 
did not opt for an alternate impasse procedure set forth in an 
MOA, and instead followed the impasse process laid out in HRS 
§ 89-11(d), that process culminating in mandatory arbitration 
would be an agreement to arbitrate conferring jurisdiction to 
the circuit court under chapter 658A. No explanation is 
51
  
                
 
 
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
provided by UPW to support this expansive contention, although 
the argument suggests that, in UPW’s view, any form of 
arbitration constitutes an agreement to arbitrate. Such a view 
does not accord with chapter 658A’s recognition of voluntary 
arbitration as fundamentally different from statutorily mandated 
arbitration. 
UPW’s view also does not accord with the statutory 
scheme set forth in chapter 89 and discussed in the previous 
section. 
That scheme recognized that arbitration in HRS § 89-11 
requires particular oversight by the HLRB because of the 
significant financial impact such arbitration could and has had 
on the State and counties. To reiterate, HRS § 89-11(d) imposes 
strict criteria for the arbitrator to consider when rendering an 
award pursuant to HRS § 89-11. In 2000, when the legislature 
overhauled large portions of chapter 89, it also instituted 
stricter criteria for what arbitrators could and must consider when rendering a decision in an HRS § 89-11 arbitration. “[T]o 
correct the abuse of the arbitration process” that led to 
arbitration awards significantly impacting the State budget, 
see 
2000 House Journal, at 746 (statement of Rep. Case), the Governor and the House even proposed that mandatory arbitration 
under HRS § 89-11 should be abolished for all collective 
bargaining units but the police and firefighters, and that the 
52

  
                
 
 
right to strike be reinstated, see 2000 House Journal, at 746 
(statement of Rep. Case); H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1344-00, in 
2000 House Journal, at 1522 (“The cost implications of mandatory 
arbitration, which is final and binding under section 89-11, 
HRS, have played a major role in the economics of the State. 
Arbitrators play a vital part in arbitrating disputes over cost 
items, with little restraint over imposing awards and no regard 
to the ability of the employer to pay.”). The legislature 
rejected that option, instead electing to: 
 
  
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Amend[] criteria for arbitration decisions, to
restrict from the arbitrator’s consideration of the employer’s ability to pay, potential revenue 
resources such as the imposition of increased or newtaxes and fees and receipt of judgments and
settlements, and any revenue estimates exceeding
those by the Council of Revenues, and to remove fromconsideration the broad 
catchall provision of other 
factors that are normally or traditionally taken intoconsideration in voluntary agreements between parties
in public service or private employment. 
S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 2686, in 2000 Senate Journal, at 1104. 
Significantly, this statement by the legislature, when 
viewed in the context of the statutory scheme, indicates that it 
recognized HRS § 89-11 arbitration as not only distinct from “voluntary agreements between parties,” i.e., voluntary 
agreements to arbitrate, but also requiring stricter control and 
oversight, given the financial ramifications such awards have on 
the State and counties. Although UPW argues the circuit court 
had jurisdiction under chapter 658A because arbitration was 
53
  
                
 
 
 
   
                                                           
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
involved, it is clear from the statutory scheme of chapter 89 
that the legislature’s mandate to the HLRB “to administer the 
provisions of chapters 89,” HRS § 89-1, also included oversight 
of the arbitration process itself. Allowing a party to remove 
an HRS § 89-11(e) arbitration from the HLRB’s jurisdiction to 
the circuit court would countermand the government’s substantial 
interest in, and chapter 89’s clear preference for, having an 
agency with expertise over the area in question responsible for 
overseeing the entire impasse process. Nor does this statutory scheme intrude on chapter 658A because the HLRB’s exercise of 
jurisdiction over HRS § 89-11(e) arbitration would not conflict 
with chapter 658A’s specific application to voluntary agreements 
to arbitrate as opposed to statutorily mandated arbitration. 
In light of chapter 658A’s inapplicability to the 
arbitration here, HSTA
 does not control the instant case, 
contrary to what UPW contends. In HSTA, the public employer, 
University Lab School (ULS), and the union representative, HSTA, negotiated a supplemental agreement concerning the salaries of 
ULS’s Unit 5
20 employees. 132 Hawai i at 428, 322 P.3d at 968. 
HSTA notified ULS that a “step placement chart” had been

“Teachers and other personnel of the department of education under the same
pay schedule, including part- time employees working less than twenty hours a 
week who are equal to one- half of a full- time equivalent[.]”

           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
“inadvertently omitted” from the agreement and should be 
included. Id. ULS denied having agreed to the terms of the 
chart. Id. 
The parties’ supplemental agreement contained an 
arbitration provision to resolve grievances. Id. at 428 n.3, 
322 P.3d at 968 n.3. 
Relying on this provision, HSTA contended 
the dispute was a grievance and requested arbitration. Id. at 
428-29, 322 P.3d at 968-69. 
ULS contested HSTA’s request to 
arbitrate, and insisted the issue was a bargaining dispute 
governed by HRS § 89–10.8(a)(1)21 rather than a grievance subject 
to the parties’ arbitration agreement. Id. at 432, 322 P.3d at 
972. ULS subsequently filed a prohibited practice complaint 
with the HLRB that alleged that HSTA violated HRS § 89– 10.8(a)(1) by attempting to use the grievance process to alter 
the supplemental agreement. Id. at 429, 322 P.3d at 969. HSTA 
responded by filing a special proceeding in the circuit court to 
compel arbitration of its grievance pursuant to HRS § 658A-7.
22 
21 HRS § 89– 10.8 (2012) governs the “Resolution of disputes; 
grievances” and provides: “A public employer shall enter into written
agreement with the exclusive representative setting forth a grievance
procedure culminating in a final and binding decision, to be invoked in theevent of any dispute concerning the interpretation or application of a
written agreement.” However, HRS § 89- 10.8(a)(1) clarifies that “[a] dispute 
over the terms of an initial or renewed agreement” is not a grievance.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Id. The circuit court denied the HSTA’s motion to compel 
arbitration, concluding that the HLRB had primary jurisdiction 
because the issues raised involved prohibited practices. Id. 
The ICA affirmed on the same grounds. Id. at 430-31, 322 P.3d 
at 969-70. 
This court vacated the ICA’s and circuit court’s 
respective judgments. Id. at 433, 322 P.3d at 973. 
In vacating the ICA, this court reasoned that “[t]he 
ICA erred in stating that pursuant to the parties’ agreements, and HRS § 89–10.8, the circuit court may only order arbitration after finding that a grievance exists.” Id. at 432, 322 P.3d at 
972. Additionally, this court concluded that “[i]t is 
immaterial whether this case involves a ‘grievance’ or a 
‘dispute over the terms of an initial or renewed agreement’” 
because, under HRS §§ 658A-6(b)-(c), “the [circuit] court shall 
decide whether an agreement to arbitrate exists or a controversy 
is subject to an agreement to arbitrate” and “an arbitrator 
(continued…)
(a) 	On motion of a person showing an agreement to
arbitrate and alleging another person’s refusal
to arbitrate pursuant to the agreement: 
(1) 	If the refusing party does not appear or doesnot oppose the motion, the court shall order
the parties to arbitrate; and 
(2) 	If the refusing party opposes the motion, thecourt shall proceed summarily to decide the
issue and order the parties to arbitrate unless
it finds that there is no enforceable agreement
to arbitrate. 
56
  
                
 
 
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
shall decide whether a condition precedent to arbitrability has 
been fulfilled and whether a contract containing a valid 
agreement to arbitrate is enforceable.” Id. at 430-32, 322 P.3d 
at 970-72 (brackets omitted). 
Thus, HSTA provided that, when a 
circuit court is faced with a motion to compel arbitration under 
chapter 658A, “the court is limited to answering two questions: 
1) whether an arbitration agreement exists between the parties; 
and 2) if so whether the subject matter of the dispute is 
arbitrable under such agreement.” Id. at 430, 322 P.3d at 970 
(quoting Koolau Radiology, Inc. v. Queen’s Med. Ctr., 73 Haw. 
433, 445, 834 P.2d 1294, 1300 (1992)). Therefore, “[t]he ICA 
need not have reached the issue of the HLRB’s possible primary 
jurisdiction over this dispute” because “the only issue before 
the circuit court was whether an arbitration agreement between 
the HSTA and the ULS existed.” Id. at 433, 322 P.3d at 973. 
HSTA is distinguishable because it involved a 
voluntary agreement to arbitrate a grievance as opposed to statutorily mandated interest arbitration. 
Whereas the union in 
HSTA sought to compel arbitration pursuant to a voluntary agreement to arbitrate, here, the arbitration was statutorily 
mandated by HRS § 89-11(e). As discussed below, although 
chapter 658A confers jurisdiction to the circuit court to compel 
voluntary “agreements to arbitrate,” chapter 658A does not

            *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
confer jurisdiction over a statutorily mandated arbitration 
pursuant to HRS § 89-11(e). As a result, it was proper for the 
circuit court in this case to deny UPW’s motion to compel 
arbitration.23 
UPW contends that HSTA is indistinguishable on this 
ground because “an agreement to arbitrate a rights arbitration 
[under HRS § 89-10.824] mirrors a legal obligation to arbitrate” 
23 Notably, the motion to compel arbitration was unnecessary, given
that HRS § 89- 11(e) already required arbitration in the instant case once the 
parties had failed to resolve their impasse within twenty days after it was
declared. HRS § 89- 11(e)(2).  Moreover, neither party disputed the need to
arbitrate the CBA.      
24 HRS § 89- 10.8 provides: 
(a) A public employer shall enter into written
agreement with the exclusive representative setting
forth a grievance procedure culminating in a final
and binding decision, to be invoked in the event ofany dispute concerning the interpretation or
application of a written agreement. The grievance
procedure shall be valid and enforceable and shall be
consistent with the following: 
(1) A dispute over the terms of an initial or
renewed agreement shall not constitute a
grievance; 
(2) No employee in a position exempted from
chapter 76, who serves at the pleasure of the
appointing authority, shall be allowed to
grieve a suspension or discharge unless thecollective bargaining agreement specifically
provides otherwise; and 
(3) With respect to any adverse action
resulting from an employee’s failure to meet
performance requirements of the employee’s
position, the grievance procedure shall provide
that the final and binding decision shall be
made by a performance judge as provided in this
section. 
(continued …) 
58
  
                
 
 
under HRS § 89-11(e). This is incorrect. Section 89-10.8 is 
distinguishable from HRS § 89-11 because it does not obligate 
parties to enter into arbitration. Nor did HRS § 89-10.8 
obligate the parties to arbitrate the grievance in HSTA. 
Section 89-10.8 requires the parties to “enter into written agreement with the exclusive representative setting forth a 
grievance procedure culminating in a final and binding decision, 
to be invoked in the event of any dispute concerning the 
interpretation or application of a written agreement.” Although parties may agree to an arbitrator rendering the final and

(b)
 The performance judge shall be a neutral third
party selected from a list of persons whom the
parties have mutually agreed are eligible to serve 
as a performance judge for the duration of the 
collective bargaining agreement. The parties, by
mutual agreement, may modify the performance judge
list at any time and shall determine a process forselection from the list. 
(c) The performance judge shall use the conditions in
section 76- 41(b) as tests in reaching a decision on 
whether the employer’s action, based on a failure by 
the employee to meet the performance requirements ofthe employee’s position, was with or without merit. 
(d) If it is alleged that the adverse action was not
due to a failure to meet performance requirements but for disciplinary reasons without just and proper
cause, the performance judge shall first proceed with
a determination on the merits of the employer’s 
action under subsection (c). If the performance
judge determines that the adverse action may be basedon reasons other than a failure to meet performance
requirements, the performance judge shall then
determine, based on appropriate standards of review,
whether the disciplinary action was with or without
proper cause and render a final and binding decision.

binding decision, the statutory provision does not preclude the 
parties from agreeing to a grievance procedure in which the 
final and binding decision is determined in a court of law. HRS 
§ 89-10.8. Were arbitration required under HRS § 89-10.8, the 
statutory provision would have explicitly said so. However, 
arbitration is never mentioned in HRS § 89-10.8, unlike in HRS 
§ 89-11(e). 
Moreover, to the extent the performance judge25 in HRS 
§§ 89-10.8(a)(3), (c)-(d) can be interpreted as an arbitrator, the performance judge is only required to determine grievances 
“[w]ith respect to any adverse action resulting from an 
employee’s failure to meet performance requirements of the 
employee’s position[.]” HRS § 89-10.8(a)(3). HSTA
 did not 
involve this type of grievance. HSTA instead involved a dispute 
over the interpretation and application of a written agreement. 
132 Hawaiʻ i at 428-29, 322 P.3d at 968-69.  UPW’s attempts to 
argue that HSTA controls the instant case are, therefore, 
without merit. 
25   The performance judge is a neutral third party who adjudicates
grievances that arise when a public employer takes an adverse action against
an employee for failing to meet the performance requirements of the
employee’s position. See  HRS §§ 89- 10.8,  76-41 (Supp. 2000).  According to
HRS § 76- 41(a), “‘performance requirements’ includes any qualification 
required for the position such as a license.”  
60
  
                
 
 
 
   
  
                                                           
     
  
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Given the above, chapter 658A was inapplicable to the 
arbitration in the instant case.26 Because UPW’s motion to 
compel arbitration was brought pursuant to chapter 658A, it was 
proper for the court to deny the motion for lack of subject 
matter jurisdiction. 
Furthermore, the circuit court’s lack of jurisdiction 
means that the doctrine of primary jurisdiction is inapplicable. 
As this court stated in United Pub. Workers, AFSCME, Local 646, 
AFL-CIO v. Abercrombie, 133 Hawaiʻ i 188, 197, 325 P.3d 600, 609 
(2014), the doctrine of primary jurisdiction applies “ where a 
claim is originally cognizable in the courts, and comes into 
play whenever enforcement of the claim requires the resolution 
of issues which, under a regulatory scheme, have been placed 
within the special competence of an administrative body.” 
26 HRS § 658A-1 (Supp. 2006) appears to contemplate that the circuit 
court has jurisdiction over some types of arbitration subject to chapter 89.
Section 658A- 1 defines “Court” to mean “any district or circuit court of 
competent jurisdiction in this State, unless otherwise indicated. In cases 
involving arbitration subject to chapter 89, chapter 377, or the National
Labor Relations Act, ‘court’ means the circuit court of the appropriate
judicial circuit.” This does not indicate, however, that chapter 658A
confers jurisdiction to the circuit court over all arbitrations implicating 
chapter 89. As HSTA showed, a public employer and union representative could 
enter into a voluntary agreement to arbitrate that concerns a CBA underchapter 89, but does not implicate the impasse procedures under HRS § 89­
11(e). Indeed, a public employer and representative of a noncritical
bargaining unit may resolve an impasse through a voluntary agreement to
arbitrate under HRS § 89- 11(d). For instance, HRS § 89- 11(d)(4) provides 
that, “After the fiftieth day of impasse, the parties may resort to such
other remedies that are not prohibited by any agreement pending between them,
other provisions of this chapter, or any other law.” If the parties then
reach a voluntary agreement to arbitrate, as permitted by HRS § 89- 11(d)(4), 
such an agreement could be subject to chapter 658A. 
61
  
                
 
 
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(Quoting  Kona Old Hawaiian Trails Group v. Lyman,  69 Haw. 81, 
93, 734 P.2d 161, 168 (1987) (emphasis added)). Primary 
jurisdiction thus applies when the circuit court and an 
administrative agency both possess original jurisdiction over 
the same claim. However, here, the doctrine is inapplicable 
because the circuit court lacked jurisdiction over the 
arbitration under chapter 658A. Therefore, the primary 
jurisdiction doctrine is not necessary to resolve whether the 
HLRB or the circuit court was the proper forum in which to adjudicate the arbitration dispute. 
In this regard, the ICA erred in relying on HRS § 89­
19 to resolve the jurisdictional dispute. 
The ICA stated that 
it “need not resolve the question of whether HRS Chapter 658A applies to interest arbitrations under HRS Chapter 89” because 
“the exclusive original jurisdiction granted to the HLRB over 
controversies concerning prohibited practices by HRS § 89-14 would supersede HRS Chapter 658A.” In reaching this conclusion, 
the ICA cited to HRS § 89—19, which states that chapter 89 
“shall take precedence over all conflicting statutes concerning 
this subject matter and shall pre-empt all contrary local 
ordinances, executive orders, legislation, or rules adopted by 
the State[.]” Yet, because the arbitration was statutorily 
mandated arbitration pursuant to HRS § 89-11(e), and not a 
62
  
                
 
 
 
    
 
  
  
  
                                                           
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
voluntary “agreement to arbitrate,” the circuit court did not 
have jurisdiction pursuant to chapter 658A. In other words, the 
ICA did not need to rely on HRS § 89-19 to resolve whether 
chapter 89 or chapter 658A would control because chapter 658A 
was inapplicable. 
D. 	The circuit court lacked jurisdiction to determine UPW’s
motion for civil contempt 
UPW argues the ICA erred in concluding that the 
circuit court lacked jurisdiction to consider UPW’s motion for 
show cause order and for civil contempt. According to UPW, “the 
circuit court had jurisdiction to consider the motion to show 
cause” under HRS § 658A-25(a) (Supp. 2001).27 However, because 
the circuit court did not have jurisdiction over the 
arbitration, it lacked jurisdiction to decide UPW’s motion for 
show cause order. 
UPW does not dispute that it brought its motion to 
show cause to enforce the circuit court’s order granting UPW’s 
motion to confirm the arbitration award. Nor does UPW dispute 
that its motion to confirm the arbitration award was brought 
pursuant to chapter 658A. According to the motion, UPW “move[d] 
27 HRS § 658A- 25(a) provides that, “Upon granting an order 
confirming, vacating without directing a rehearing, modifying, or correcting
an award, the court shall enter a judgment in conformity therewith. The 
judgment may be recorded, docketed, and enforced as any other judgment in a
civil action.” 
63
  
                
 
 
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
pursuant to Section 658A-22, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS), for 
confirmation and enforcement of an arbitration decision and 
award dated January 14, 2010, for entry of a judgment in 
conformity with an order confirming the award pursuant to 
Section 658A-25(a), HRS[.]” After the circuit court granted 
UPW’s motion, UPW then moved the circuit court to order the 
State “to show cause why [it] should not be held in civil 
contempt for disobeying the Court’s May 18, 2010 order granting 
the UPW’s motion to confirm and to enforce arbitration award[.]” However, as discussed above, the circuit court did not have 
jurisdiction over the interest arbitration under chapter 658A. 
Therefore, the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to consider 
UPW’s motion to confirm the arbitration award, as well as its 
motion for show cause order. 
UPW contends that it was deprived of a statutory means 
to enforce the award through a motion for show cause order and for civil contempt. Although “[c]onfirmation of an arbitration 
award is an expeditious procedure for reducing or converting the 
arbitration award to a judgment which can be enforced by 
judicial writ[,]” Mikelson v. United Servs. Auto. Ass’n, 122 
Hawai
ʻi 393, 395, 227 P.3d 559, 561 (App. 2010) (citations and 
quotation marks omitted), the circuit court’s lack of 
jurisdiction in this case does not deprive UPW of a statutory 
64
  
                
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
means to enforce the arbitration award under chapter 89. 
Section 89-11(g) (Supp. 2004) provides that “[t]he decision of 
the arbitration panel shall be final and binding upon the 
parties on all provisions submitted to the arbitration panel.” 
Section 89-11(g) requires that “[t]he parties shall take 
whatever action is necessary to carry out and effectuate the 
final and binding agreement[,]” set forth in the arbitration 
decision. If a party does not comply with this requirement to 
carry out the arbitration decision, the aggrieved party can bring a prohibited practice complaint under HRS chapter 89, 
including HRS §§ 89-13(a)(6) or (b)(3) for “[r]efus[ing] to 
participate in good faith in the mediation and arbitration 
procedures set forth in section 89-11”; and HRS §§ 89-13(a)(7) 
or (b)(4) for “[r]efus[ing] or fail[ing] to comply with any 
provision of this chapter[.]” The HLRB, upon finding that a 
party has committed a prohibited practice by not complying with the arbitration award, “may require the respondent to do any or 
all of the following: to cease and desist from the prohibited 
practice found to have been committed; to suspend the 
respondent’s rights, immunities, privileges, or remedies granted 
or afforded by chapter 89, HRS, for not more than one year; or 
to require the respondent to take such affirmative action as 
will effectuate the purpose of chapter 89, HRS . . . [.]” HAR

§ 12-42-50 (effective 1981-2014). In the event a party does not abide by the HLRB’s order to enforce the award, the HLRB can 
petition the circuit court “for the enforcement of the order and 
for appropriate temporary relief or restraining order . . . [.]” 
HAR § 12-42-51 (effective 1981-2014). Any party disagreeing 
with the HLRB’s decision relating to the enforcement of an 
arbitration award may also file an administrative appeal in the 
circuit court of the HLRB’s decision pursuant to HRS § 91-14 
(Supp. 2004). In light of the extensive administrative remedies available under chapter 89, and the right to an administrative 
appeal under HRS § 91-14, the statutory scheme set forth in 
chapter 89 provides participants in the impasse procedure with 
sufficient means to enforce an HRS § 89-11 arbitration award. 
Accordingly, the ICA was correct to conclude that the 
circuit court’s order denying UPW’s motion for civil contempt 
should be vacated for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
28 
 It appears the ICA relied on its jurisdictional analysis in part
II.B. of its opinion, which, as discussed supra, is erroneous to the  extent 
that it presumes the circuit court had jurisdiction under chapter 658A and
 
that the HLRB’s exclusive original jurisdiction prevails because of HRS § 89­
19. Nevertheless, the ICA was correct to conclude that the circuit court
lacked jurisdiction to  decide the motion for show cause order.  See  Strouss 
v. Simmons,  66 Haw. 32, 40, 657 P.2d 1004, 1010 (1982) (“An appellate court
may affirm a judgment of the lower court on any ground in the record which
supports affirmance.”).

E. The HLRB had the authority to select the neutral arbitrator 
UPW argues that the HLRB exceeded its authority by 
ordering the AAA to appoint the neutral arbitrator. 
Specifically, UPW contends the HLRB could not fashion a remedy 
beyond what was contemplated by the parties’ MOA, which set 
forth that the neutral arbitrator would be selected by having 
the parties alternately strike names from an AAA list until a 
single name was left. Contrary to UPW’s contentions, the HLRB 
had the authority to fashion such a remedy and under the circumstances did not abuse its discretion in ordering such a 
remedy. 
Section 89-5(i)(4) grants the HLRB broad authority 
regarding prohibited practice complaints. 
Section 89-5(i)(4) 
provides that the HLRB shall “[c]onduct proceedings on complaints of prohibited practices by employers, employees, and 
employee organizations and take such actions with respect thereto as
 it deems necessary and proper [.]” (Emphasis added). 
Moreover, under HAR § 12-42-71 (effective 1981-2014), which governs the selection and certification of an arbitration panel 
during an HRS § 89-11 impasse, “[i]f either the public employer 
or exclusive bargaining representative fails to select an 
arbitrator within three days after the filing of the arbitration 
notification, the board shall select an arbitrator from the 
67

  
                
 
 
 
   
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
register of arbitrators.” See State v. Kotis, 91 Hawaiʻ i 319, 
331, 984 P.2d 78, 90 (1999) (“Administrative rules, like 
statutes, have the force and effect of law.”) (citing 
State v. 
Kirn, 70 Haw. 206, 208, 767 P.2d 1238, 1239–40 (1989)). 
In addition to the HLRB’s express powers, it is also 
“well established that an administrative agency’s authority 
includes those implied powers that are reasonably necessary to 
carry out the powers expressly granted.” Morgan v. Planning 
Dep’t, Cnty. of Kauai,  104 Hawaiʻ i  173, 184, 86 P.3d 982, 993 
(2004). Indeed, in Del Monte Fresh Produce (Hawaii), Inc. v. 
International Longshore & Warehouse Union, Local 142, AFL-CIO, 
112 Hawaiʻ i 489, 506, 146 P.3d 1066, 1083 (2006), this court 
stated that the “as the board may deem proper” phrase in then-HRS § 377-9(d), “show[ed] that the Hawaiʻ i legislature empowered 
the HLRB with discretion to determine appropriate remedies for 
the commission of unfair labor practices.” 
In the instant case, the remedy provided by the HLRB, 
i.e., ordering the AAA to select the neutral arbitrator, was not 
an abuse of discretion.  As the ICA noted, “[t]he purpose of HRS 
§ 89-11 is to facilitate the timely resolution of an impasse in 
negotiations over collective bargaining agreements[,]” and time was of the essence given that the prior CBA had expired on 
June 30, 2009. 
As discussed supra, despite the necessity of 
68
  
                
 
 
 
   
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
resolving the impasse quickly, the parties continued to delay 
the selection of the neutral arbitrator. 
Specifically, although the parties agreed to select 
the neutral arbitrator within five days of receiving the AAA 
list on July 17, 2009, they mutually agreed to extend the date 
to July 28, 2009. During this period, the parties could not 
select the neutral arbitrator. From July 15, 2009 to July 28, 
2009, the State’s bargaining representative, Laderta, repeatedly 
attempted to contact UPW’s bargaining representative, Nakanelua, but according to Laderta, Nakanelua would not return Laderta’s 
calls. Then, on July 28, 2009, UPW’s counsel, Takahashi, 
informed the State that he would be representing UPW in the 
selection. The parties took more time by conducting their 
communications through letter. Only after Halvorson, the 
State’s counsel, requested the HLRB’s assistance, did the 
parties begin to strike names off the AAA list. However, the parties only managed two strikes by August 20, 2009, before 
filing prohibited practice complaints against each other. 
Because of the parties’ conduct, none of the five arbitrators 
could be scheduled for the date set by the MOA for the 
arbitration, September 11, 2009. The HLRB thus found that both 
parties had been responsible for the “undue delay” in the 
selection of the neutral arbitrator. Indeed, by the time the 
69
  
                
 
 
 
  
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
HLRB entered its September 25, 2009 order for interlocutory 
relief, the parties had allowed the CBA to expire for over three 
months without negotiating a renewal. Given these 
circumstances, the HLRB did not abuse its discretion in ordering 
the AAA to select the neutral arbitrator from the remaining 
three names on the AAA list. 
IV. Conclusion 
The ICA’s April 4, 2014 judgment on appeal is 
affirmed, as clarified by this opinion.
