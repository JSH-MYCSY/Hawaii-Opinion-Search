vacating the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and
 
Plea/Judgment entered by the District Court of the First Circuit
 
2
 (district court) on April 8, 2010,  and remanding to the district
court for dismissal without prejudice.
 
In his application for writ of certiorari, Petitioner
 
contends that the ICA erred by refusing to address the issue of
 sufficiency of the evidence to support the excessive speeding
 conviction. 
However, Petitioner did not raise this issue in his 
Opening Brief in compliance with Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure Rule 28(b). See also State v. Davis, No. SCWC-12­
0000074 (Haw. Feb. 26, 2014). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the January 10, 2013
 
Judgment on Appeal of the ICA is affirmed.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, February 27, 2014.
