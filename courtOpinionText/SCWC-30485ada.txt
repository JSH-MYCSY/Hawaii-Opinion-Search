We note that AOAO did not raise a claim to the ICA for unjust  
enrichment or quantum meruit based on the Furuyas’ obligation to pay lease 
rent on the parking stalls after April 26, 2014.  Id.    at 16 n.11.   Our 
affirmance of the ICA’s memorandum opinion does not address the merits of 
such a claim.  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
Inc. (AOAO) both filed   applications for writ of certiorari.  The 
applications concerned various issues related to the Furuyas’ 
interests in an apartment unit located at the  Pacific Monarch 
Condominium (Pacific Monarch) and 106 parking stalls which are appurtenant to the  unit.  We accepted both applications for writ 
of certiorari.   Below, we address the arguments raised in the 
Furuyas’ application for writ of certiorari and for the reasons 
discussed herein, we affirm the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ (ICA) judgment on appeal.   We do not address the arguments 
raised by AOAO in its application for writ of certiorari, as 
1AOAO failed to demonstrate that the ICA erred.       
1 AOAO raised claims regarding: (1) the Furuyas’ obligation to pay 
lease rent for the parking stalls after April 26, 2014, and (2) AOAO’s use of 
two of the parking stalls without compensating the Furuyas. As to AOAO’s 
first claim, the ICA held that the circuit court did not err in interpreting 
the conveyance document from the developer to the initial lessees as 
indicating that the developer intended to give up its right to lease rent of 
the parking stalls after 2014. Furuya v. Ass’n of Apartment Owners of P ac. 
Monarch, Inc.,  No. 30485, at 12-14  (App. Apr. 25, 2014) (mem.) .   In addition, 
the ICA held that the Furuyas had no statutory obligation to pay lease rent. Id. at 18.    In regards to AOAO’s second claim, the ICA held that the circuit 
court abused its discretion in estopping the Furuyas from seeking damages for AOAO’s use of the two stalls after the filing of the Furuyas’ initial 
complaint. Id. at 28.    The ICA’s holdings were not erroneous.

  The Pacific Monarch is a condominium project located 
in Honolulu, Hawai ʻi.  The AOAO of the Pacific Monarch was 
created to “provide  the management, maintenance, protection,  
preservation, control and development” of the Pacific Monarch. 
AOAO is governed by its Board of Directors (Board).    In 1979, 
apartment unit 3206 and the parking stalls were conveyed by  
Hasegawa Komuten (USA), Inc., the developer of the Pacific 
Monarch, to the initial lessees, via the Pacific Monarch 
Condominium conveyance document.  The Furuyas acquired  the 
leasehold interest to apartment  unit  3206 at the Pacific Monarch 
for $560,000 through a foreclosure sale in July 1985.  Pursuant  
to the original conveyance document, unit 3206 was conveyed to 
the original owners with several appurtenant easements, 
including an exclusive appurtenant easement to parking stalls 1 
through 106 of the condominium.   The Furuyas acquired the 
leasehold interest in apartment unit 3207 in December 1989.

2the leased fee interest in the condominium from the lessor to 
offer the owners the opportunity to own the leased fee interests 
in their units. To proceed with the purchase, the Board amended 
its Bylaws.  Article III of the amended November 14, 1995 
Restated Bylaws conferred certain “powers and duties” to AOAO’s 
Board, including, “Implementation of the Acquisition of the 
Leased Fee Interest in the Land from Lessor.” The Board was 
authorized and had the power to do all things it deemed necessary to enable the lessor to sell the leased fee interest to AOAO and/or its members. The Bylaws further stated that on 
behalf of AOAO, the Board was authorized to purchase all or any 
portion of the leased fee interest in the land from the lessor 
and expressly authorized to transact any and all other matters 
relating to the acquisition.  The Board was also required to 
obtain agreement from owners who represented at least 75% of the 
common interest to (1) ratify AOAO’s purchase of the leased fee interest, and (2) commit to and contract for the purchase of 
their leased fee interest.  
As noted, the Furuyas owned a leasehold interest in 
unit 3206 and the appurtenant easement to the 106 parking

stalls, as well as a leasehold interest in unit 3207.  The Board 
sent the Furuyas a survey dated April 23, 1996 asking them to 
indicate whether they intended to purchase the leased fee 
interests in their two units and the parking stalls.3 The 
Furuyas signed the document, checking off a pre-printed line that stated, “YES, I plan to purchase my leased fee interest in 
Unit #3206 at $28,756.85, Unit #3207 at $28,756.85 and 106 
Parking Stalls at $459,131.19.”  
On or around 
October 16, 1996, the Furuyas executed a 
document titled “Pacific Monarch Leased Fee Interest Sales Contract Deposit Recei pt Offer and Acceptance” (DROA ), in 
preparation for the bulk sale of a number of units in the condominium.  The Furuyas filled out and signed the portion of 
the DROA titled “Offer.” The Furuyas handwrote “3206” following 
the section stating, “ [t]he buyer is buying the leased fee 
interest to the following apartment or commercial unit in the 
Pacific Monarch project. ” Attached to the DROA was an exhibit 
indicating the prices for the various units. Units 3206 and 3207 were priced at $28,756.85. The 106 parking stalls were 
also included in the attached exhibit and priced at $459,131.19. 
The portion of the DROA titled, “Acceptance” stated, “The

survey stated, “This is NOT a contract for the purchase of your leased fee 
interest.” 
5
  
 
 
Association agrees to sell the Property to the Buyer or its 
designee at the price and upon the terms set forth herein, 
including the Additional Terms attached hereto.” The 
“Acceptance” portion provided a line for AOAO to sign as 
“Acceptance” of the DROA. The  DROA in the record was not signed 
by AOAO and there is no evidence in the record that AOAO  ever 
signed the “Acceptance” portion of the DROA. The Furuyas also 
4 signed a DROA for unit 3207.  
   
 
  
  
     
  
 
                         
    
 
 
   
  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
The DROAs for units 3206 and 3207 set the closing date 
for the acquisition of the leased fee interest for the two units 
as December 9, 1996. In accordance with the instructions in the 
DROA, the Furuyas sent $1,000 per unit to open escrow for both 
units 3206 and 3207. The purchase of the leased fee interest in 
unit 3207 closed with the bulk sale of the leased fee interests 
in a number of other units in the condominium on December 27, 
51996.
Although escrow was opened for the purchase of the 
leased fee interest in unit 3206 and the Furuyas deposited 
$1,000 into escrow with Title Guaranty of Hawaiʻ i (Title 
Guaranty) for the unit, the sale of the leased fee interest in

by AOAO. 
5 The original closing date set in the DROA was extended until 
December 27, 1996. 
6
  
 
 
     
 
   
   
 
  The heart of the dispute in this case is whether there 
was an enforceable contract for the purchase of the leased fee 
interest in unit 3206 and the parking stalls, and whether 
following the signing of the DROA, the Furuyas  elected not to 
purchase the leased fee interest in the parking stalls. The 
record indicates— and the Circuit Court of the First Circuit 
(circuit court) found  —that very soon after  the Furuyas signed 
the DROA for unit 3206, they informed AOAO that they did not 
want to purchase the leased fee interests in the parking stalls. 
However, the Furuyas dispute this finding, and argue that AOAO 
refused to close because it determined it wanted to control the 
parking. The relevant evidence regarding this issue is 
discussed herein. 
  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
unit 3206 was never closed.  The record does not contain a fully 
executed contract between the Furuyas and AOAO for the purchase 
of unit 3206 and/or the parking stalls. The Furuyas did not 
fund the escrow account with payment of $28,756.85 for unit 3206 
or $459,131.19 for the 106 parking stalls. 
C.	 AOAO Retains Ownership of Unit 3206 and the Parking Stalls 
and Negotiations Regarding Sale of the Leasehold Interest

Clarence Furuya (Furuya) informed AOAO Board members and Caesar 
Paet (Paet), a consultant at Cadmus Properties hired by AOAO to 
assist in the purchase of the leased fee interest from the 
lessor, that he no longer wanted to purchase the leased fee 
interest in the 106 parking stalls.6 James Dozier (Dozier), AOAO 
treasurer, testified that “almost immediately Mr. Furuya 
indicated he would buy the fee to both Units 3206 and 3207 but 
would not buy the fee for the parking stalls.” Dozier also 
testified that after Furuya indicated he did not want to purchase the parking stalls the Board decided it would be in its  
best interest to   “buy the fee rather than sell it, to buy the 
parking stalls rather than sell [them].” Henry Foil Craver  
(Craver), an AOAO Board member, also testified that the Furuyas  
indicated they did not wish to purchase the leased fee interest 
in the parking stalls, and that he heard this information from 
Dozier. Specifically, Craver stated that Dozier spoke to Furuya, who told Dozier  that he had “changed his mind and 
decided he didn’t want to buy the fee” in the parking stalls. Similarly, Paet testified that  Furuya informed him that he no 
longer wanted to buy the parking stalls, but he could not recall the timeframe of this communication.   
6 Prior to trial, the parties took several depositions and 
designated portions of the testimony for trial.  The deposition designation 
testimony was received into evidence by the circuit court on June 24, 2009. 
8
  
 
 
  AOAO representatives also testified that  after signing 
the DROA, the Furuyas informed AOAO that they wanted to sell the  
leasehold interest to the 106 parking stalls to AOAO.   Craver 
testified that Furuya “decided that he wa nted to sell the 
parking stalls” and Paet stated that Furuya made an offer to  
AOAO to sell the parking   stalls.  The record contains written 
offers to sell the parking stalls to AOAO from Furuya’s agent .   
On or around October 29, 1996 —around two weeks after Furuya 
signed the DROA—Jason Lum  (Lum), Furuya’s real estate broker, 
sent a written offer to AOAO to sell the Furuyas’ leasehold 
interest to 81 parking stalls for $1,215,000.   Around two weeks 
later, on November 15, 1996, Lum sent a second written offer to the Board to sell all 106 stalls to AOAO for $1,166,000, and 
provided specific financing terms for the sale of the parking 
stalls. At trial, however, Furuya disclaimed his involvement in the written offers sent from Lum to AOAO and testified that he 
7 never wanted to sell the parking stalls.      
   
   
  
                         
   
         ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
The record indicates that because the Furuyas decided 
not to purchase the leased fee interest in the parking stalls, 
AOAO determined that it was in its interest to retain ownership 
in the parking stalls and purchase the leasehold interest from 
7 The circuit court found Furuya’s testimony not credible , as noted 
infra.

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
the Furuyas. To finance the purchase of the parking stalls, 
AOAO issued a special assessment of $55 per month to all of the 
apartment owners. 
The Furuyas’ apparent decision not to purchase the 
leased fee interest in the parking stalls, AOAO’s subsequent 
decision to retain ownership of the parking stalls, and the 
negotiations regarding the sale of the leasehold interest in the 
parking stalls from the Furuyas to AOAO were memorialized in 
internal and external AOAO documents. In a November 6, 1996 meeting, AOAO discussed “the parking owner’ s decision not to 
purchase the fee interest in the parking.” At the meeting, 
Dozier reported that Furuya was interested in selling the 
leasehold interest in 81 of the parking stalls to AOAO and 
“recommended negotiating with the parking owner for the sale of 
all the parking stalls.” On December 19, 1996, Galen Leong 
(Leong), an attorney at Ashford & Wriston, LLP, wrote to Michael 
Peitsch at Title Guaranty, regarding the Furuyas’ decision not 
to purchase the parking stalls, noting, “[t]he owners of 
Apartment 3206 have indicated that they wish to buy the leased 
fee interest in Apartment 3206 but not the leased fee interest 
in the parking stalls which are appurtenant to Apartment 3206.” 
AOAO Board President, Elwin Stemig (Stemig), in a January 14, 
10
  
 
 
   
 
 
  
 
  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
1997 letter to the condominium owners, explained the situation 
regarding the parking stalls: 
When the owners approved the [AOAO]  Board’s decision to 
purchase the fee interest to the land on which the Pacific 
Monarch building rests, this also included purchasing the 
fee interest for the 106 parking stalls in the parking 
garage. Since the [AOAO]  purchased the fee interest, the 
owner of the 106 pa  rking stalls has decided not to purchase 
his fee interest from the [ AOAO].   The cost to the [ AOAO]  
for the fee interest to the parking stalls  was $422,000.  
Thus the [ AOAO]  was faced with a decision as to whether to 
retain the parking fee interest to the 106 parking stalls 
or to sell it to an  outside party.  The Board made the 
decision to retain the fee simple interest to the parking 
stalls and set a goal to eventually purchase all the  106 
parking stalls from the present owner  and operate the 
parking garage to generate extra income to the [AOAO].  At 
this stage it became necessary  for the Board to levy a 
special assessment  to payoff the extra expense of $422,000. 
It will take approximately four years to payoff this debt.    
 
At this time the owner of the 106 parking stalls in the 
parking garage operates the garage and receives  the revenue 
therefrom but pays lease  payments to the [AOAO]  since the 
[AOAO]  now owns the fee interest to the 106 parking stalls.  
The owner of the parking stalls has indicated an  interest 
in selling same  [sic] to the  [AOAO]  since he did not choose 
to buy the  fee interest to the parking stalls.  Thus the 
Board intents [sic] to  negotiate  with the parking stalls 
owner to buy the stalls sometime within the next  year.  
 
(Emphases added). 
As noted by Stemig, and according to Furuya’s trial 
testimony, Furuya started to pay lease rent to AOAO for the 
parking stalls following AOAO’s purchase of the leased fee 
interest in the parking stalls.  Notably, according to Furuya’s 
account summary provided by AOAO, Furuya also paid the $55 a month assessment for the parking stalls between January 1, 1997 
through December 31, 1999.

D.	 Attempt to Separate the Interests in Unit 3206 and the 
Parking Stalls 
Following the Furuyas ’ apparent decision not to 
purchase the parking stalls, it appears that AOAO and the 
Furuyas negotiated to separate the leased fee interests in unit 
3206 and the parking stalls, in order to allow the Furuyas to purchase the leased fee interest in unit 3206 only. In the 
letter from Leong to Title Guaranty, referenced above, Leong 
explains that selling the leased fee interest to unit 3206 and 
not the leased fee interest to the parking stalls, without 
separating them, would be impossible under the condominium 
conveyance document because “[a] partment 3206 and the parking 
stalls which constitute its limited common elements must be 
treated as undivided part s of a whole.” Leong stated that the 
parking stalls should be separated from the unit and proposed 
different methods of accomplishing the separation. On March 27, 
1997, Paet sent a fax to Alfred Hee, an attorney for AOAO, 
informing him that Lum, the Furuyas’ broker , agreed to 
separating the parking stalls from unit 3206. The document noted that “[i]n order to c onvey the fee interest for unit 
#3206, the parking stall interest must be separated from the apartment.” In the document, AOAO indicated that it “[would] 
handle the separation of interests at its’ [sic] expense.” A

  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
fax from Lum to Paet on March 31, 1997, provided  that “Mr. 
Furuya is in agreement to separate the apartment and parking 
interest for unit 3206.”      
E.
	 Continued Negotiations Regarding the Parking Stalls and 
2003-2004 Communications 
Between 1997 and 2004, the record indicates that AOAO 
and the Furuyas continued to negotiate AOAO’ s purchase of the 
leasehold interest in the parking stalls and the sale of the 
leased fee interest in unit 3206 to the Furuyas.  For example, 
the Board’s December 18, 2000 and February 12, 2001 meeting 
minutes note that the Board’s attorney was “in the process of 
drawing up the legal paperwork for Clarence Furuya to sign to 
swap the parking stalls” and that the attorney was “working on 
the sale of the fee for unit 3206,” respectively. However, the 
Furuyas and AOAO did not reach an agreement on either issue. 
On September 11, 2003, Title Guaranty sent a letter to 
the Furuyas noting that escrow for unit 3206 had been opened “on 
or about October 21, 1996,” but that they had not “received the seller’s signed contract” and had not been instructed to close 
escrow. Approximately two months later, on December 1, 2003, 
Furuya sent a letter to AOAO in order to complete the purchase 
from AOAO of the leased fee interest in unit 3206 and the parking stalls. Furuya claimed in the letter that he contracted 
13
  
 
 
  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
with AOAO for the purchase of the leased fee interest in unit 
3206, paid his deposit, and escrow had been opened for the unit. 
He explained that escrow was never closed and AOAO refused to 
allow him to purchase the leased fee interest for unit 3206 and 
the parking stalls attached to the unit. Furuya then proposed 
in the letter that AOAO allow him to purchase unit 3206 for 
$28,756.85 and the parking stalls for $459,131.19, the original 
pricing included in the 1996 DROA.   In return, Furuya stated 
that he would not pursue a cause of action against AOAO for 
“willfully delaying the closing of escrow for unit 3206 and the 
purchase of the fee interest of the parking stalls attached to the unit.” He also stated that if AOAO pursued the purchase of 
the leasehold interest in the parking stalls from the Furuyas, 
it would cost AOAO over $2,000,000.    
AOAO’s attorneys responded i n a December 23, 2003 
letter to Furuya and explained AOAO’s  version of the events.  
The letter stated that Furuya was “given the opportunity to buy 
the leased fee interest” in the parking stalls in 1996, but that 
he refused to buy the parking stalls and only wanted the leased 
fee interest in units 3206 and 3207. According to AOAO ’s  
attorneys, the sale of unit 3206 was never finalized because 
“the Association learned that the 106 parking stalls were 
14
  
 
 
    
 
 
  
 
  
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
attached to unit 3206 and if the Association sold [the Furuyas] 
the leased fee interest to unit 3206” the Furuyas would in 
effect be purchasing the leased fee interest to the 106 parking stalls while only paying the cost of the leased fee interest for 
unit 3206. AOAO stated in the letter that it investigated a 
legal procedure to sever the 106 parking stalls from unit 3206 
to enable the Furuyas to purchase only the leased fee interest 
to unit 3206. 
The letter also stated that AOAO expressed an interest 
in purchasing from the Furuyas their leasehold interest in the 
parking stalls and began negotiations to purchase the parking stalls.  The letter indicated that because the Furuyas countered 
with a “much too high price,” AOAO continued to negotiate for 
the purchase of the parking stalls and at that point also 
negotiated to purchase unit 3206.  The letter stated that after 
three meetings, no agreement could be reached.  According to 
AOAO, at the last of the meetings, the Furuyas told AOAO that 
they wanted to purchase the leased fee interest to the 106 parking stalls, and that at this time, AOAO informed the Furuyas 
that they no longer wanted to sell the leased fee interest in 
the parking stalls.  AOAO informed the Furuyas that it continued 
to be interested in purchasing the leasehold interest in the 
15
  
 
 
       
   
 
   
   
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
parking stalls “with or without unit 3206.” 
On or around December 10, 2004, Furuya sent a letter 
to Title Guaranty Escrow Services canceling the escrow for unit 
3206 and requesting that his $1,000 deposit be returned.  
F. Furuya’s Trial Testimony 
On June 22, 2009, Furuya testified at trial as to his 
understanding of the sale of the leased fee interest in unit 
3206 and the parking stalls. He testified that he had been 
ready to close on unit 3206 when Dozier informed him that AOAO 
would not be able to close unit 3206 because it had to separate 
the apartment from the parking stalls.  Furuya testified that Dozier told him not to be concerned about the closing date.  He 
stated that he could understand the need to separate the unit 
from the parking stalls because otherwise, he would own the fee 
in unit 3206 and the parking stalls while paying only for unit 
3206. Furuya contended that later, AOAO approached him about 
purchasing his leasehold interest in the parking stalls.  Furuya 
claimed that although Lum was his principal broker and authorized to look for real estate deals for him, he did not ask 
Lum to sell the leasehold interest to the parking stalls. He 
maintained that he always intended to close on unit 3206 and the 
parking stalls, but that he did not fund escrow because Dozier

had informed him that they needed to separate the parking stalls 
from the unit.   
II. Procedural History 
A. Circuit Court Proceedings 
The Furuyas filed their initial complaint against AOAO 
in June 2006. On November 30, 2007, the Furuyas filed their 
first amended complaint (“Complaint” or “FAC”) alleging thirteen 
8 counts against AOAO.   Relevant here, the Furuyas alleged breach 
of contract by AOAO seeking damages and specific performance;  
promissory estoppel based on AOAO’s alleged promise to sell the 
Furuyas the unit and parking stalls; and declaratory relief, 
injunctive relief, and ultra  vires actions, in relation to 
AOAO’s retention of the leased fee interest in unit 3206 .   AOAO 
8 The Furuyas asserted the following thirteen counts against AOAO 
in their f irst amended complaint: Count I— breach of contract (relating to 
AOAO’s refusal to sell the leased fee interest in unit 3206 and the parking 
stalls to the Furuyas); Count II —specific performance; Count IV— injunctive 
relief (seeking an injunction barring AOAO from selling the Furuyas’ interest 
to a third party); Count V —declaratory judgment (seeking, among other things, 
a declaration that the Furuyas “have no obligation to pay lease rent on the parking stalls after 2014”); Count VI —promissory estoppel (claiming that the 
Furuyas detrimentally relied on AOAO’s promises to convey the leased fee interest to the Furuyas); Count VII —equitable estoppel (claiming that the 
Furuyas detrimentally relied upon AOAO’s assurances that the Furuyas would be 
entitled to purchase the leased fee interests and AOAO’s conduct in assisting other apartment owners in purchasing their respective fee interests); Count 
IX—ultra vires actions (claiming that AOAO does not have the right under the 
declaration and bylaws “to hold and maintain parking stalls in its own name 
in derogation of the rights of the individual unit owners”); Count X —unjust 
enrichment (claiming that AOAO would be unjustly enriched if it were allowed to retain the leased fee interest to unit 3206 and the parking s talls); and 
Count XI— conversion (claiming that AOAO converted some of the parking 
stalls).  
Counts III, VIII, XII, and XIII were dismissed prior to trial.

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
filed an answer to the Furuyas’ Complaint. In relevant part, 
AOAO averred that the Furuyas and AOAO entered into negotiations 
for the purchase by AOAO of the leasehold interest in the 106 
parking stalls because the Furuyas only wanted to purchase the 
leased fee interest to unit 3206, but not the 106 parking 
stalls. 
The case was tried without a jury.  Prior to trial, 
and as discussed supra , the parties conducted several 
depositions, portions of which were stipulated into evidence at trial. Furuya also testified at trial. On June 24, 2009, after 
the Furuyas’ case-in-chief, AOAO moved the court for a directed 
verdict pursuant to Hawaiʻ i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 
41(b) (2009).
9 
The circuit court orally ruled that it would treat 
AOAO’s motion as a motion to dismiss, and would therefore 
consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the 
nonmoving party, the Furuyas. The court concluded that the DROA 
was not an enforceable contract and entered an order dismissing 
the Furuyas’ breach of contract claims. The circuit court also 
dismissed the Furuyas’ declaratory relief, injunctive relief, 
9 HRCP Rule 41(b) is titled “Involuntary dismissal: Effect thereof” 
and provides for dismissal “[f]or failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to 
comply with these rules or any order of court, a defendant may move for 
dismissal of an action or of any claim against it. ”

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
ultra vires, promissory estoppel, and equitable estoppel claims 
at this time. Of relevance here, the court noted that there was 
no reasonable reliance on the part of the Furuyas to justify 
their claims for promissory and equitable estoppel and that 
AOAO’s actions did not justify the injunctive relief, ultra 
vires, and declaratory relief claims. 
The claims remaining from the Furuyas’ Complaint 
related to 1) the Furuyas ’ allegation that they did not have an 
obligation to pay lease rent for the parking stalls after the 
year 2014; and (2) the Furuyas’ unjust enrichment claim, 
specifically, the Furuyas’ allegation that they were entitled to 
damages for the alleged unauthorized use of two parking stalls 
that were assigned as laundry facilities. Trial continued on 
the foregoing issues, and the circuit court entered its Findings 
of Fact and Conclusions of Law on March 2, 2010 (“March 2 
FOF/COL”). The March 2 FOF/COL explicitly stated that the 
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law related only to the 
remaining claims from the Furuyas’ Complaint, namely whether the Furuyas had an obligation to pay lease rent for the parking 
stalls and whether the Furuyas were entitled to damages for 
alleged unauthorized use of two of the parking stalls.

B. The Furuyas’ Appeal to the ICA10 
On appeal to the ICA, the Furuyas argued that the 
circuit court failed “to find facts specifically and to state 
conclusions separately as required by  HRCP Rule 52 in granting 
in part the  AOAO’s HRCP Rule 41(b) motion.” The Furuyas argued 
that the entire order failed to meet the standard of providing 
findings and conclusions and thus, made it impossible to 
determine what facts and law the trial court used in making its 
“clearly erroneous decision.”  
The Furuyas also maintained that the circuit court was 
clearly erroneous in granting AOAO’s HRCP Rule 41(b) motion
.  
Relevant here, the Furuyas argued that the circuit court erred 
in finding and concluding that the DROA was not an enforceable 
contract. In this respect, the Furuyas claimed that the circuit 
court’s findings that unit 3206 was offered to the Furuyas but 
that the DROA did not constitute an enforceable contract were “impossible to reconcile.” They maintained that the DROA was 
AOAO’s offer, while the Furuyas’ execution and return of this DROA constituted their acceptance.  The Furuyas contended that 
AOAO admitted in a deposition that the parties had “made the 
10 AOAO cross -appealed.  The only issue relevant on certiorari 
included in AOAO’s cross -appeal involves its claim that the circuit court and 
the ICA erred in concluding that the Furuyas owe no rent to AOAO for the 
parking stalls after 2014. As noted supra, this issue is not addressed in 
this opinion. 
20
  
 
 
deal,” and that AOAO admitted in its Answer to the Furuyas’ 
Complaint that it had accepted the DROA, escrow had opened, and 
earnest money had been deposited. Relatedly, the Furuyas 
claimed that AOAO’s Restated Bylaws required AOAO to sell unit 
3206 to the Furuyas, and that AOAO had failed to do so.   The 
Furuyas also argued that any contention that there was no 
“meeting of the minds” concerning the sale of the leased fee 
interests to unit 3206 because the Furuyas refused to purchase 
the leased fee interest to the parking stalls  was without merit 
and that they were ready, willing, and able to perform on the 
contract. The Furuyas contended that there is no  separate  
leased fee interest  for the 106 parking stalls because they are 
limited common elements appurtenant to a unit; the parking 
stalls were not themselves a unit.    
   
 
 
     ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
As 
to the Furuyas’ declaratory relief, injunctive 
relief, and ultra vires claims, the Furuyas argued that pursuant 
to AOAO’s Restated Bylaws, AOAO was “required to sell the leased 
fee” to the Furuyas and “[had] n o authority to retain the leased 
fee interest.” The Furuyas also claimed that the circuit court 
erred in dismissing their promissory estoppel claim because all 
of the elements of promissory estoppel had been satisfied. 
AOAO argued the following in response to the Furuyas’ 
21
  
 
 
    
 
   
 
    
 
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
breach of contract claim: (1) the Furuyas were not ready, 
willing, and able to close on unit 3206; (2) the DROA was not an 
enforceable contract; and (3) AOAO did not prevent the Furuyas 
from closing. In addition, AOAO disputed the Furuyas’ 
contention that the 106 parking stalls did not have a leased fee 
interest separate and apart from unit 3206.  AOAO argued that 
the 106 parking stalls are an undivided interest in the land 
leased by the Furuyas separate and apart from their leasehold 
interest in unit 3206.  
As to the Furuyas’ injunctive relief, declaratory 
relief, and ultra vires claims, AOAO argued that AOAO could retain possession of the leased fee interest in the unit because 
its actions were supported by the Bylaws and by statute.  AOAO 
also claimed that the Furuyas’ promissory estoppel claim was 
correctly dismissed because the Furuyas voluntarily decided not 
to close on the purchase of unit 3206. 
C. The ICA’s Temporary Remand 
On October 25, 2012, the ICA issued an order for 
temporary remand to the circuit court.  The ICA held that 
pursuant to HRCP Rule 52(a) (2006), the circuit court was 
required to support its partial dismissal order with findings of 
fact and conclusions of law. The ICA further held that although 
22
  
 
 
    
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
the circuit court dismissed a number of the Furuyas’ claims 
pursuant to HRCP Rule 41(b), the ruling should be considered to 
be made pursuant to HRCP Rule 52(c). The ICA noted that 
pursuant to HRCP Rule 52(c), “[i]f, as here, after a bench trial 
where a party has been fully heard on an issue, the court enters judgment as a matter of law, that judgment shall be supported by 
findings of fact and conclusions of law. ”   The ICA thus  
temporarily remanded the case to the circ  uit court for entry of 
findings of fact and conclusions of law to support its dismissal  
of the counts in the Furuyas’ Complaint.   
D.
	 The Circuit Court’s December 21, 2012 Findings of Fact and 
Conclusions of Law 
Pursuant to the ICA’s order for temporary remand, the 
circuit court issued its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law 
in support of its Order partially dismissing the following 
counts alleged by the Furuyas in their Complaint: breach of 
contract seeking damages and specific performance, injunctive relief, declaratory relief, promissory estoppel, equitable 
estoppel, ultra vires act, and conversion.  
Regarding the breach of contract claim, the circuit 
court determined that the DROA constituted an “offer” to AOAO 
for the purchase of the leased fee interests to unit 3206 and the appurtenant parking stalls; however, the circuit court found 
23
  
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
that the DROA was never signed by AOAO nor was it ever modified 
or amended. The circuit  court thus concluded that no  
enforceable agreement existed between the Furuyas and AOAO as to the sale of the leased fee interest in unit 3206 or the 
appurtenant parking stalls because there was neither an 
acceptance by AOAO of the written agreement for the unit or 
stalls, nor was there a meeting of the minds as to the  sale of 
the unit and stalls.   
The circuit court also determined that 
the Furuyas 
decided not to purchase the leased fee interest in the parking 
stalls soon after executing the DROA, and accordingly, did not fund the escrow account with the payment for unit 3206 or the 
parking stalls. The following Findings of Fact are relevant to 
this issue: 
54. The closing documents for Apartment Unit 3207 were 
executed on or about December 13, 1996, and the deed was 
recorded on December 27, 1996. 
55. The FURUYAS did not fund the escrow account with the 
payment of $28,756.85 for Apartment 3206. 
56. The FURUYAS did not fund the escrow account with the 
payment of $459,131.19 for the 106 Parking Stalls. 
57. There is no sales contract for the FURUYAS [’] purchase 
of the leased fee interest for the Apartment Unit 3206 and 
the appurtenant 106 Parking Stalls. 
58. CLARENCE FURUYA did not ask for an extension of the 
closing date for the purchase of the leased fee interests 
for Apartment 3206 or the 106 Parking Stalls. 
59. Shortly after executing the DROAs, the FURUYAS decided 
that they did not want to purchase the leased fee interests

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
to the 106 Parking Stalls. 
60. Well before the December 9, 1996, closing date, 
CLARENCE FURUYA informed the AOAO ’s Board members and its 
Lease-to-Fee Conversion Consultant, Caesar Paet, that the 
FURUYAS no longer wanted to acquire the leased fee interest to the 106 Parking Stalls. 
61. Because of the FURUYAS [’] decision to not purchase of 
[sic] the leased fee interest to the Parking Stalls and 
decision to sell the Parking Stalls to the AOAO, there was no closing on the sale of the leased fee interests to 
Apartment 3206 or the 106 Parking Stalls to the FURUYAS. 
62. CLARENCE FURUYA did not request Title Guaranty to keep 
escrow opened so he could complete the purchase of the 
leased fee interest. 
. . . . 
77. After the FURUYAS decided that they did not want to 
acquire the leased fee interest in the 106 Parking Stalls, 
CLARENCE FURUYA informed several [of] AOAO’s Board members 
and Ceasar [sic] Paet that he wanted to sell the leasehold 
interest to the 106 Parking Stalls to the AOAO. 
78. The FURUYAS ’ decision to not close on the purchase of 
the leased fee interests was reported to other third -
parties evaluating to sale [sic] of the leasehold interests 
to the Parking Stalls. Attorney Galen Leong of Ashford & 
Wriston wrote to Michael Peitsch at Title Guaranty of 
Hawaiʻi about the FURUYAS ’ decision not to purchase of [sic] 
the leased fee interests for Apartment Unit 3206 and the 
appurtenant 106 Parking Stalls. 
79. The FURUYAS informed the AOAO that they wanted to sell 
the leasehold interest to the 106 Parking Stalls to the 
AOAO. 
. . . . 
86. On or about October 29, 1996, the FURUYAS submitted a 
written offer to the AOAO to sell to it the leasehold 
interest to 81 parking stalls for $1,216,000 [sic]. 
87. The [] written offer to the AOAO to sell the leasehold 
interest to 81 parking stalls for $1,216,000 [sic] to the AOAO was prepared an d sent by the FURUYAS’ princip[al] real 
estate broker, Jason Lum. 
. . . . 
25
  
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
  The circuit court also concluded in its Findings of 
Fact that “[a]ny delay in  [the] closing of Apartment Unit 3206  
was not caused by the AOAO’s failure to take steps to separate 
the leasehold interest in the 106 Parking Stalls from the 
leasehold interest in the Apartment Unit 3206 ”  and relatedly, ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
91. Lum had no independent authority to offer to sell or to 
sell or to negotiate to sell any of CLARENCE FURUYA’ s 
properties. 
. . . . 
93. As reflected in the minutes of the November 1996 Board 
of Directors ’ meeting, the written offer by CLARENCE FURUYA 
was considered and discussed by the AOAO’s Board: 
There was a discussion over the parking owner ’s 
decision not to purchase the fee interest in the parking. Jim Dozier noted that the parking 
owner is interested in selling 81 of the 
parking stall [sic] to the AOAO. Jim recommended negotiating with the parking owner 
for the sale of all the parking stalls. . . 
There was further discussion over the AOAO 
holding on to the fee simple title in the 
parking stall and extensive discussion over financing of the purchase of the AOAO’ s 
reserves rather than including it in the AOAO ’s 
bank loan. . . . 
94. On or about November 15, 1996, CLARENCE FURUYA submitted another written offer to the AOAO for the sale of 
all 106 Parking Stalls to the AOAO for $1,166,000. 
95. This November 15, 1996 offer to sell all 106 Parking 
Stalls to the AOAO provided specific financing terms for 
the sale of the Parking Stalls. 
96. CLARENCE FURUYA’ s trial testimony that he had nothing 
to do with the written offers to sell the 106 Parking 
Stalls and he “absolutely did not offer to sell the parking stalls to the AOAO” is not c redible. 
(Record citations omitted). 
26
  
 
 
    The circuit court  entered the following related 
Conclusions of Law:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
that “[t]he separation discussion was not  the reason that 
prevented the FURUYAS from closing on the sale of the leased fee 
interests to the apartment unit and the Parking Stalls.”  
15. There was no acceptance by the AOAO of an [sic] written 
agreement for the sale of the leased fee interests in the 
106 Parking Stalls after the FURUAYS [sic] decided not to 
purchase the leased fee interest to the 106 Parking Stalls 
and decided not to close on the purchase of the leased fee interests for Apartment Unit 3206 and the 106 Parking 
Stalls. 
16. There was no meeting of the minds between Plaintiffs 
and the AOAO as to the sale of the leased fee interests for the Apartment Unit 3206 and the Parking Stalls. 
17. “[I]f a promisor himself is the cause of the failure of 
performance * * * of a condition upon which his own 
liability depends, he cannot take advantage of the failure. . . . [N]o one can avail himself of the non -
performance of a condition precedent, who has himself occasioned its non -performance. . . . The doctrine is 
purely one of waiver. . . . ” See  Ikeoka v. Kong, 47 Haw. 
220, 228[,] [386 P.2d 855, 860] (1963). 
18. The DROA for Unit 3206 did not create a contract with the AOAO for the purchase of the leased fee interests to 
the 106 Parking Stalls. 
19. The DROA for Unit 3206 executed by CLARENCE FURUYA is 
not an enforceable agreement against the AOAO for the 
purchase of the leased fee interests to Apartment Unit 3206 
and the appurtenant 106 Parking Stalls. 
20. There was no meeting of the minds between the FURUYAS 
and the AOAO as to the FURUYAS [’] purchase of the leased 
fee interests to the Apartment Unit 3206 and the 
appurtenant 106 Parking Stalls. 
. . . . 
27. The termination of the escrow for the DROA by the 
FURUYAS effectively terminated any alleged offer for the 
purchase of the leased fee interests in the Apartment Unit 3206 and the Parking Stalls. 
27
  
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
  The Furuyas and AOAO submitted supplemental briefing 
to the ICA regarding the circuit court’s December 21, 2012 
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. The parties in large 
part reiterated the arguments in their original briefings to the ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
. . . . 
30.
 The “failure by the party seeking to establish the 
enforceability in equity of a contemplated contract, to 
show his ability, readiness and willingness to perform 
essential acts required or obligations incurred therein, 
reflects in itself a fundamental lack of mutuality.” 
Molokai Ranch v. Morris, [36 Haw. 219, 228 (Haw. Terr. 
1942)]. 
31.
 The maxim “He who seeks equity mus t do equity,” bars 
the FURUYAS’ request for specific performance. See 
2 A. 
Corbin, Corbin on Contracts § 310 at 44 (1950 & Supp. 
1992[)] ( “[I]t is well- recognized that []no [person] should 
profit by his [or her] own wrong. ”); Adair v. Hustace , 64 
Haw. 314, 320[,] [640 P.2d 294, 300 (1982 )] (The doctrine 
of laches reflects the equitable maxim that “equity aids 
the vigilant, not those who slumber on their rights.” []). 
(Record citations omitted).  
 
With respect to the remaining claims addressed in the 
circuit court’s December 21, 2012 Findings of Fact 
and 
Conclusions of Law, the court held as follows: 1) the Furuyas 
could not recover based on their promissory estoppel or 
equitable estoppel claims because there was no reasonable 
reliance; 2) the Furuyas’ injunctive relief , declaratory relief, 
and ultra vires act claims failed because AOAO acted within its authority by retaining the leased fee interests in the unit and 
the parking stalls, and there was no enforceable agreement.  
E. Supplemental Briefs to the ICA 
28
  
 
 
    
  The ICA held that the circuit court did not err  in 
concluding there was no enforceable contract between AOAO and 
the Furuyas for the purchase of the leased fee interests 
associated with unit 3206 and the parking stalls.  Furuya v. 
Ass’n of Apartment Owners of Pac. Monarch, Inc. , No. 30485 , at 
18-21 (App. Apr. 25, 2014) (mem.).  According to the ICA, under 
the plain language of the DROA, Furuya was making an offer that 
AOAO “would ultimately have to accept ”  to create a binding 
contract. Id. at 19 .   The ICA found that AOAO had not signed 
the DROA on the designated acceptance line of the document; therefore, the circuit court had not erred in concluding that 
the DROA for unit 3206 was not a binding contract. Id.   The ICA 
also rejected the Furuyas’ claim that AOAO  admitted acceptance 
of the offer in previous pleadings, determining that the Furuyas 
waived the argument because it was not raised below and the ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
ICA. The Furuyas and AOAO continued to dispute the following 
issues: (1) the existence of an enforceable contract for the 
leased fee interest for unit 3206 and the appurtenant 106 
parking stalls; (2) whether the parking stalls had a leased fee  
interest separate and apart from the leased fee interest of unit 3206; and (3) AOAO’s obligation to sell unit 3206 and the  
parking stalls pursuant to its governing documents.

  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
issue of whether the contract was enforceable was disputed at 
trial. Id. at 21.   
As to the Furuyas’ injunctive relief, declaratory 
relief, and ultra vires claims, the ICA determined that the 
circuit court did not err in dismissing the claims because 
AOAO’s Restated Bylaws did not require “the AOAO to offer, or to 
not retain, the leased fee interest.” Id. at 22.  The ICA held 
that the Furuyas’ promissory estoppel claim was properly 
dismissed by the circuit court for lack of “reasonable reliance 
by the Furuyas on any promise by the AOAO .” Id.  at 23. 
III. Standard of Review 
A.	 Order Granting Partial Dismissal Pursuant to HRCP Rule 
52(c) 
The ICA concluded in its order for temporary remand to 
the circuit court that although the circuit court dismissed 
several of the Furuyas’ claims pursuant to HRCP Rule 41(b), the 
ruling should be considered made pursuant to HRCP Rule 52(c). The parties do not dispute the ICA’s determination. 
As the ICA determined, “[w ]
here we have patterned a 
rule of procedure after an equivalent rule within the FRCP 
[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure], interpretations of the rule 
by the federal courts are deemed to be highly persuasive in the 
reasoning of this court.” Furuya, mem. op. at 10 (quoting

52, 948 P.2d 1055, 1092 –93 (1997)). HRCP Rule 52(c) was modeled 
after FRCP Rule 52(c). See Hawai i Rules Committee, Proposed 
Red-Line Rules and Commentary to the Hawai i Rules of Civil 
Procedure, Rules Committee Notes to Rules 41 and 52 (July 23, 
1997). The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit 
has held that “[i] n reviewing the district court’s judgment 
entered under Rule 52(c), we review its findings of fact for 
clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.” United Steel 
Workers Local 12-
369 v. United Steel Workers Int’l , 728 F.3d 
1107, 1114 (9th Cir. 2013). The court also noted that “in the context of a bench trial . . . ‘
[i]f the district court’s 
account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record reviewed in its entirety, [we] may not reverse it even though 
convinced that had [we] been sitting as the trier of fact, [we] 
would have weighed the evidence differently. ’”  Id. (alteration 
in original) (citation omitted). 
B. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law 
A finding of fact is clearly erroneous “when the 
record lacks substantial evidence to support the finding” or 
when “despite evidence to support the finding, the appellate 
court is left with the definite and firm conviction in reviewing 
31
  
 
 
the entire evidence that a mistake has been committed.” Bhakta 
v. Cty. of Maui
, 109 Hawaiʻ i 198,  208, 124 P.3d 943, 953 (2005)

IV. Discussion 
On certiorari, the Furuyas maintain their position 
that the DROA constituted an enforceable contract for 
the 
purchase of unit 3206 and the 106 parking stalls. The Furuyas 
additionally argue that the ICA gravely erred by sua sponte 
determining that AOAO’s Bylaws did not requ ire that AOAO offer 
the leased fee interest to the lessees; concluding that the Furuyas waived their argument that AOAO admitted there was a 
contract; and affirming the circuit court’s promissory estoppel 
ruling. In response, AOAO claims that there was no enforceable contract because AOAO never “accepted” the DROA; AOAO’s 
possession of the leased fee interests is not prohibited by the 
Bylaws; and there was substantial evidence to support dismissal

A. Breach of Contract Claims 
The main issue on appeal relates to the Furuyas’ 
claims for specific performance and damages based on their 
contention that AOAO breached the DROA by failing to sell the 
Furuyas unit 3206 and the parking stalls. Throughout the 
litigation, the Furuyas have maintained that the DROA for unit 
3206 sent to the Furuyas constituted an offer; the Furuyas’ 
signature of the DROA constituted acceptance; and AOAO breached 
the contract by refusing to sell the Furuyas the leased fee interest in unit 3206 and the parking stalls.  The circuit court 
rejected the Furuyas’ argument, concluding that the DROA did not 
create “an enforceable agreement against the AOAO for the 
purchase of the leased fee interests to Apartment Unit 3206 and 
the appurtenant 106 Parking S talls.” The ICA agreed with the 
circuit court, determining that the court did not err in finding 
that AOAO “did not accept the DROA” and “in finding that the Furuyas unsuccessfully attempted to purchase the fee interest 
for 3206 without the parking stalls.” Furuya, mem. op. at 19.  
The circuit court also noted in its Conclusions of 
Law, however, that “[i]f a promisor himself is the cause of the 
failure of performance [] of a condition upon which his own liability depends, he cannot take advantage of the failure” and 
33
  
 
 
   
    
 
   
 
 
  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
a party seeking equity for a breach of contract claim must 
demonstrate “ability, readiness and willingness to perform.”  
Relatedly, the court determined that “[t]he maxim ‘[h]e who 
seeks equity must do equity ,’ bars the FURUYAS’ requ est for 
specific performance.” (Citations omitted). As intimated by 
the circuit court, whether or not there was a valid and 
enforceable contract, specific performance will not be granted 
where the party fails to demonstrate that he or she was ready, 
willing, and able to perform on the contract throughout the contract term; and a party seeking damages cannot recover where 
the party is responsible for the breach. Here, in its Findings 
of Fact, the circuit court determined that the Furuyas decided 
not to purchase the leased fee interest to the parking stalls 
and that because of this decision, the DROA for apartment unit 
3206 and the parking stalls never closed. The circuit court’s 
findings are supported by substantial evidence and are not 
clearly erroneous. Thus, notwithstanding the Furuyas’ claim 
that the DROA constituted an enforceable contract for unit 3206 and the parking stalls, their claims are barred because, 
pursuant to the circuit court’s findings, their decision not to 
purchase the parking stalls after executing the DROA 
demonstrated that they were not ready, willing, and able to 
34
  
 
 
perform on the contract; and relatedly, the Furuyas were 
responsible for the failure of the DROA to close.   Because the 
circuit court’s findings in this regard were not clearly erroneous, the circuit court did not err in rejecting Furuyas’ 
breach of contract claims.           
   
  
 
 
 
 
   
        
   
                         
   
  
   
  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
It is a well
-established principle of contract law, 
and recognized in our jurisdiction, that when seeking specific 
performance for a contract involving land, “to obtain relief, 
plaintiffs must show that they were ready, willing, and able to 
perform their obligations.” 71 Am. Jur. 2d Specific Performance  
§ 131 (2015); 
see also   Kalinowski v. Yeh,
 9 Haw. App. 473, 478 -
79, 847 P.2d 673, 677 (1993) 
(noting that purchasers were ready, 
willing, and able to perform all their obligations in affirming 
the circuit court’s granting of specific performance on a 
condominium sale). “A failure, inability, or refusal  to carry 
out the terms of a contract at the time when performance is due 
will ordinarily be grounds for refusing specific performance.” 
81A C.J.S. Specific Performance  § 80 (2015) (emphasis added).11 
Thus, in PR Pension Fund v. Nakada , 8 Haw. App. 480, 
11 Determinations of whether a party is ready, willing, and able to 
perform in this context frequently depend on the purchaser’s ability or 
“financial capability” to make the required payments, because “the 
willingness of the purchaser is seldom in dispute.” 69 Am. Jur. 3d Proof of 
Facts 99, § 1 ( 2002). However, here, the Furuyas’ willingness was in 
dispute, and the circuit court specifically determined that the DROA did not 
close because the Furuyas decided not to purchase the parking stalls.   
35
  
 
 
    
 
 
 
  Here, the Furuyas never tendered performance, that is, 
they did not deposit the required funds in escrow to close on 
the purchase of unit 3206 and the parking stalls ($28,756.85 for 
the unit plus $459,131.19  for the parking stalls).  Thus, in 
order to maintain their claim for specific performance, the ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
490, 809 P.2d 1139, 1145 (1991), in a claim for specific   
performance of a sale of land through a DROA, the court held the 
circuit court abused its discretion in granting specific 
performance, because the plaintiff “failed to prove that 
Plaintiff was ready, willing, and able to timely close.” The 
court noted that 
[w]here a purchaser seeks specific performance of a land 
purchase contract, the general rule provides that he must 
show that (1) he paid the purchase price or tendered it to 
the seller or (2) he has a good excuse for his failure to so pay or tender
 and has the readiness, willingness, and 
ability to pay.   
 
Id. at 488-89, 809 P.2d at 1144-45 (emphasis added).  Based on 
the facts of the case, the court concluded that there was no 
evidence from which the trial court could conclude the 
“Plaintiff’s ability to pay the purchase price.” Id. at 489, 
809 P.2d at 1145. In so holding, the court contrasted other cases in which readiness, willingness, and ability to perform 
were not an issue, because the entirety of the purchase price had been deposited in escrow. Id. at 490-91, 809 P.2d at 1145-
46. 
36
  
 
 
   
 
 
  
 
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
Furuyas had to prove that they were ready, willing, and able to 
perform throughout the contract term.   However, the circuit 
court found that the Furuyas were not willing to perform during the contract term, specifically noting  that “[s]hortly  after 
executing the DROAs, the FURUYAS decided that they did not want to purchase the leased fee interests to the 106 Parking Stalls” 
and that “[b]ecause of [their]  decision” not to purchase the 
parking stalls, “there was no closing on the sale of the lea sed 
fee interests to Apartment 3206 or the 106 Parking Stalls to the 
FURUYAS.”    
The circuit court’s finding that the deal failed to 
close because of the Furuyas’ decision not to purchase the 
parking stalls was supported by substantial evidence in the 
record.  As discussed supra
, testimony from AOAO’s Board members 
indicated that Furuya informed the Board, as well as AOAO’s 
consultant, Paet, that he no longer wanted to purchase the parking stalls and instead, the Furuyas wanted to sell the 
leasehold interests in the parking stalls to AOAO. In this 
vein, the Furuyas’ broker, Lum, sent two written offers to AOAO 
to sell their leasehold interest to the parking stalls to AOAO.  The circuit court’s conclusion that the Furuyas decided not to 
purchase the parking stalls is also supported by documentary 
37
  
 
 
    The Furuyas  claim that they were ready, willing, and 
able to close on the purchase of unit 3206  and that the reason 
the DROA did not close was that AOAO wanted to “control the 
parking” and realized that it could not sell unit 3206 without  
selling the appurtenant stalls.  In support, they cite to 1) the  
2004 letter from AOAO’s attorneys to the Furuyas in which, 
according to the Furuyas, “[t]he  attorney confirmed that it was 
the AOAO that refused to close the sale” ; 2)  Craver’s deposition 
testimony that after the Furuyas  decided not to close on unit 
3206, AOAO realized that the apartment would have to be 
separated from the parking stalls; and 3) Furuya’s testimony 
that he was ready to deposit the funds in escrow and that the 
reason he did not do so was that the parking stalls had to be ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
evidence in the record.   In particular, the Board’s November 6, 
1996 meeting minutes memorialized the Furuyas’ “decision not to 
purchase the fee interest in the parking”; a letter  from AOAO’s 
attorneys to Title Guaranty noted that the Furuyas wanted to purchase “the leased fee interest in Apartment 3206 but not the 
leased fee interest in the parking stalls”; and a letter from 
the President of the Board to AOAO condominium owners indicated 
that “the owner of the 106 parking stalls has decided not to  
purchase his fee interest from the [AOAO].”  
38
  
 
 
   
  
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
separated from the unit. However, the 2004 letter and Craver’s 
testimony appear to address the actions that took place after  
the Furuyas decided not to purchase the leased fee interest in the parking stalls, during the period when the parties 
negotiated to attempt to separate the interests in the unit from 
the interest in the parking stalls.  In addition, despite  
Furuya’s testimony that he did not deposit funds in escrow because the parking stalls needed to be separate from the unit, 
the circuit court made a finding that the issue of separating the parking stalls from the apartment “was not the reason that 
prevented the FURUYAS from closing on the sale of the leased fee 
interests to the apartment unit and the Parking Stalls. ”   Based 
on the evidence in the record, this finding was not clearly 
erroneous. Moreover, the circuit court’s determination was 
based on its assessment of witness credibility, which we will 
not second guess on appeal. See, e.g., Tamashiro v. Control 
Specialist, Inc., 97 Hawaiʻ i 86, 92, 34 P.3d 16, 22 (2001) 
(“[T]he credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given 
their testimony are within the province of the trier of fact 
and, generally, will not be disturbed on appeal.”).   
The circuit court’s denial 
of the Furuyas’ breach of 
contract claim is further supported by the principle that “a 
39
  
 
 
party who breaches or causes the other party to breach an 
agreement cannot enforce the agreement to his or her benefit.” 
Stanford Carr Dev. Corp. v. Unity House, Inc. , 111 Hawai ʻi 286, 
300, 141 P.3d 459, 473 (2006);  see also  PR Pension Fund, 8 Haw. 
App. at 491, 809 P.2d at 1146 (noting “a party cannot recover for a breach of contract if he fails to comply with the contract 
himself”  (citation omitted)); cf.  Kahili, Inc. v. Yamamoto , 54  
Haw. 267, 272, 506 P.2d 9, 12 (1973) (“The general rule is that 
where a person by his own act makes impossible the performance 
or the happening of a condition such nonperformance should not 
relieve him from his obligation under a contract.”); Kalinowski , 
9 Haw. App. at 478  -79, 847 P.2d at 677 (“[N]o person can defend 
against contractual liability on grounds of a condition 
precedent when he [or she] is responsible for that condition 
precedent not being complied with.” (second alteration i n 
original) (citation omitted)).   In other words, if a party is 
responsible for another party’s lack of performance, he or she 
cannot successfully assert a breach of contract claim for 
damages. 
 
  
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
In sum, because —
based on the circuit court’s 
findings—the Furuyas failed to demonstrate they were ready, 
willing, and able to perform on the contract throughout the 
40
  
 
 
contract term, their claim for specific performance fails. 
Similarly, because the circuit court found that the Furuyas were 
responsible for the failure of the DROA to close, they cannot  
prevail on their claim for damages. The fact that the Furuyas came forward in 2004, approximately seven years after the 
initial closing date of the DROA, and stated that they were 
ready to close on the DROA and that they had  always wanted to  
purchase the leased fee interest in unit 3206 along with the  
appurtenant stalls was considered and rejected by the circuit 
court. Substantial evidence in the record supports the circuit 
court’s conclusion that prior to the closing of the  DROA, the  
Furuyas changed their minds  and were not prepared to pay the 
$459,131.19 for the parking stalls.   Accordingly, the Furuyas 
have failed to demonstrate error in the circuit court’s 
12 decision.

B.
	 Declaratory Relief, Injunctive Relief, and Ultra Vires 
Claims 
The Furuyas additionally claim that the ICA gravely 
erred by determining that the Restated Bylaws did not require 
12 As noted supra , the Furuyas argue that there was no separate 
leased fee interest in unit 3206 and the parking stalls. This argument has 
no bearing on our conclusion that the Furuyas’ claims must fail because they 
decided not to purchase the parking stalls.  Even assuming the Furuyas are 
correct, their decision not to purchase the parking stalls demonstrated that they were not willing to follow through with the alleged contract, because 
based on the Furuyas’ argument, the DROA for unit 3206 included the 
appurtenant parking stalls.   
41
  
 
 
AOAO to sell the leased fee interests acquired from the lessor  
to the condominium unit owners. The Furuyas argue that if 
AOAO’s sending of the DROA to the Furuyas did not constitute an 
offer, as the ICA held, AOAO never made them an offer to 
purchase unit 3206, resulting in a violation of the Restated 
Bylaws. On this basis, the Furuyas maintain  that the circuit 
court’s dismissal of its declaratory  relief, injunctive relief,  
and ultra vires claims should be vacated.   In response, AOAO 
reasserts its earlier argument that AOAO’s possession of the 
leased fee interest is  not prohibited by its Bylaws or by 
statute.      
   
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
Pursuant to Article III, Section 2 of the Restated 
Bylaws, the Board of Directors “shall have the powe rs and duties 
necessary for the 
administration of the affairs of the 
Association and may do all acts and things except such as by law, the Declaration or these Bylaws may not be delegated to the Board of Directors by the Apartment Owners.” The Restated 
Bylaws state in relevant part: 
Such  powers and duties of the Board of Directors shall 
include, but shall not be limited to , the following:  
. . . . 
(m)
 Purchasing or leasing or otherwise acquiring in the 
name of the Board of Directors or its nominee, corporate or 
otherwise, on behalf of all Apartment Owners, any 
apartments; 
. . . . 
42
  
 
 
   
 
 
 The Board of Directors shall be authorized and have 
the power to do all things it deems necessary to enable the 
Lessor and/or its successors or assigns of the leased fee 
interest in the land (Lessor) to sell that interest to the Association and/or its members. The Board on behalf of the 
Association shall be authorized to purchase all or any 
portion of the Leased Fee interest  in the land from the  
Lessor and is expressly authorized to transact any and all other matters relating to the acquisition specifically but not limited to the following:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  The plain language of the Bylaws provide that AOAO can 
purchase or lease apartments in the name of the Board  and has 
the power and authority “to hold title to the  leased fee 
interest” if “necessary and in the best interest” of AOAO .   
Here, as discussed supra, the circuit court determined that the ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____

. . . . 
5. To sell the leased fee interest in the land

or other interested third party by any equitable method of 
sale as determined in the sole discretion of the Board.

sale of unit 3206 failed to close because of the Furuyas’ 
decision not to purchase the parking stalls, and after this  
decision, the Board decided it would be in its best interest to retain the leased fee in the parking stalls.   On this basis, the 
circuit court determined that AOAO acted “[p]ursuant  to [its]  
authority and power.” The circuit court further noted: “Nothing 
in the By-Laws . . . states that the association of apartment 
owners ‘must’  or ‘can only’  sell to the lessee after the lessee 
declines to purchase their leased fee interest when it is 
initially offered by the homeo wners’ association.” We agree. 
Based on the circuit court’s  finding that the Furuyas decided 
not to purchase their leased fee interest, and the language of 
the Bylaws, the circuit court’s determination was not 
13 erroneous.   Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in 
rejecting the Furuyas ’  related claims for injunctive relief, 
declaratory relief, and ultra vires act.    
     
  Finally, the Furuyas argue that the ICA gravely erred 
in holding that the circuit court properly dismissed  their 
                         
    
  
    ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
C. Promissory Estoppel Claim 
13 Because we determine that the circuit court did not err based on 
its determination that the Furuyas chose not to purchase their leased fee 
interest, we need not determine whether the ICA gravely erred in holding that 
the Bylaws did not require AOAO to sell the leased fee interest “at all.” 
Furuya, mem. op. at 20.  We additionally note that the Furuyas have failed to 
demonstrate that AOAO’s retention of the leased fee interest resulted in a 
violation of Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes chapter 514C (1993). 
44
  
 
 
     
 
 
  
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
promissory estoppel claim. The Furuyas claim that the circuit 
court’s justification for dismissing their promissory estoppel 
claim was inconsistent with the ICA’s determination “that no 
offer was made” by AOAO to sell the  parking stalls.  
Notwithstanding the ICA’s decision, the circuit court’s determination that the Furuyas ’  reliance was not reasonable was 
not clearly erroneous, and thus, the court properly  rejected  the 
Furuyas’ claim for promissory estoppel .  
In Ravelo v. County of Hawai ʻi, 66 Haw. 194, 201, 658 
P.2d 883, 887–88 (1983), this court expressly adopted section 90 
of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts (1979), which articulates the doctrine of promissory estoppel as a “Promise 
Reasonably Inducing Action or Forbearance.” The elements of 
promissory estoppel include: (1) a promise; (2) at the time the promisor made the promise, the promisor must “foresee that the 
promisee would rely upon the promise ( foreseeability)”; (3) 
“
[t]he promisee does in fact rely upon the promisor’s prom ise
”; 
and (4) “[e]nforcement of the promise is necessary to avoid 
injustice. ” Applications of Herrick , 82 Hawai
ʻi 329, 337-38, 
922 P.2d 942, 950-51 (1996). We have also noted that “[t]he 
‘essence’ of promissory estoppel is ‘detrimental reliance on a 
pro
mise.’” Gonsalves v. Nissan Motor Corp. , 100 Hawaiʻ i 149, 
45
  
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
165, 58 P.3d 1196, 1212 (2002)  (quoting Ravelo, 66 Haw. at 199, 
658 P.2d at 887).  Pursuant to the commentary of the 
Restatement, the reasonableness of the promisee’s  reliance on 
the promise is also relevant. Specifically, the commentary notes that a determination as to whether enforcement of the 
promise is “necessary to avoid injustice . . . may depend on the 
reasonableness of the promisee’s reliance.” Restatement 
(Second) of Contracts § 90 cmt. b (1981)  .     
In the instant case, t
he circuit court determined that 
the Furuyas’ reliance on the DROA or other “alleged statements” by AOAO was unreasonable given that, inter alia, the Furuyas 
“voluntarily decided not to p urchase the leased fee interest to 
the Parking Stalls .” On this basis, the circuit court dismissed 
the Furuyas’ promissory estoppel claim. The circuit court’s 
findings related to the Furuyas’ decision not to purchase the 
parking stalls, discussed supra, support its conclusion.  Put 
another way, once the Furuyas decided not to purchase the 
parking stalls, they could no longer reasonably rely on any 
alleged promise by AOAO to sell the leased fee interest in unit 
3206 and/or in the parking stalls. Relatedly, enforcing any 
alleged promise made by AOAO would not be necessary to avoid 
injustice, because —based on the circuit court’s findings —the

Furuyas were responsible for the outcome of which they now 
complain. Accordingly, the circuit court properly rejected the 
Furuyas’ promissory estoppel claim.14
