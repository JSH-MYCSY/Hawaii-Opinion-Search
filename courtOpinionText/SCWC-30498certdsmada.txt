STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent/Plaintiff-Appellee,
 
vs.
 
ROBERT GRANT, Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant.
 
CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
(ICA NO. 30498; CR. NO. 08-1-0521)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, and McKenna, JJ.,
and Circuit Judge Garibaldi, in place of Duffy, J.,
recused, with Acoba, J., dissenting separately)
 
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant Robert Grant’s
 
application for writ of certiorari, filed on April 9, 2012, was
 
filed more than thirty days after the filing of the ICA’s
 January 6, 2012 judgment on appeal. 
The application is untimely
 
and thus, this court lacks appellate jurisdiction. See HRS §
 
602-59(c) (Supp. 2011); HRAP Rule 40.1(a). Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the application for writ of
 
certiorari is dismissed.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, May 15, 2012.
