CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS

RECKTENWALD, C.J., NAKAYAMA, ACOBA, DUFFY, AND MCKENNA, JJ.
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY ACOBA, J.
 
We hold that Hawai
'i Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 409.5 
(2007), which provides that evidence “express[ing] sympathy, 
commiseration, or condolences concerning the consequences of an event in which the declarant was a participant is not admissible to prove liability for any claim[,]” applies in civil but not in criminal cases. Accordingly, the circuit court of the first 
1
circuit (the court)  and the Intermediate Court of Appeals (the
ICA) erred in applying HRE Rule 409.5 in this criminal case. 
Here, Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant Blue Lealao (Petitioner)
 
1
 The Honorable Michael A. Town presided.
         
           
      
      
     
       
     
   
           
       ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
remarked “I’m so sorry. I made a big mistake.” The court erred
 
in concluding that the admissibility of Petitioner’s statement
 regarding having “made a big mistake,” was governed by HRE Rule
 409.5. The court also erred in excluding the preceding words,
 
“I’m so sorry,” because those words explained the context of the
 “mistake” comment. However, such error was harmless beyond a
 reasonable doubt in light of Petitioner’s testimony in this case,
 in which he explained the statement that he made a big mistake
 and essentially expressed regret that the incident had taken
 place. Moreover, the statement “I’m so sorry. I made a big
 mistake” was relevant and admissible as a party admission under
 HRE Rule 803(a)(1) in this criminal case. Accordingly,
 Petitioner’s April 20, 2010 amended judgment of conviction and
 sentence for Assault in the Second Degree, HRS § 707-711 (2011),
2
 
must be affirmed.

In his Application for Writ of Certiorari
 
(Application), Petitioner seeks review of the October 18, 2011
 judgment of the ICA filed pursuant to its September 19, 2011

summary disposition order (SDO),  affirming the Petitioner’s
2
 HRS § 707-711 states that (1) a person commits the offense of
 
assault in the second degree if:
 
(a) the person intentionally or knowingly causes
substantial bodily injury to another; [or]
 
(b) The person recklessly causes serious or
substantial bodily injury to another;

conviction. See State v. Lealao, No. 30502, 2011 WL 4357741, at
 
*1 (App. Sept. 19, 2011) (SDO). The following essential matters,
 
some verbatim, are from the record and the submissions of the
 parties.
 
A.
 
On August 27, 2008, Respondent/Plaintiff-Appellee State 
of Hawai' i (Respondent) charged Petitioner with Assault in the 
First Degree, Hawai' i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-710 (1993).
4 
Prior to trial, on February 3, 2010, Petitioner filed a Motion in Limine (Motion) to exclude “[a]ny statements of condolences made by [Petitioner]” pursuant to HRE Rule 409.5 and State v. Canady, 80 Hawai' i 469, 911 P.2d 104 (App. 1996). HRE Rule 409.5 (2008) 
provides: 
Admissibility of expressions of sympathy and
condolence. Evidence of statements or gestures that express
sympathy, commiseration, or condolence concerning the
consequences of an event in which the declarant was a
participant is not admissible to prove liability for any
claim growing out of the event. This rule does not require
the exclusion of an apology or other statement that
acknowledges or implies fault even though contained in, or
part of, any statement or gesture excludable under this
rule.
 
(Emphases added.) 
Just prior to the filing of the Motion, Respondent
 
informed defense counsel that it intended to call Chelcey Pang
 
Lealao (Chelcey) to testify at trial. Chelcey is married to
 
5
Petitioner’s nephew, Bob, a.k.a. Kui, Lealao, Jr. (Kui),  and is
4
 HRS § 707-710 states that “(1) a person commits the offense of
 
assault in the first degree if the person intentionally or knowingly causes
serious bodily injury to another person.”
 
5
 On August 2, 2008, the date of the incident herein, Chelcey was
 
Kui’s girlfriend. They were subsequently married.
 
3
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
also the niece of the complainant in this case, Emil Kruse III
 
(Emil). Respondent informed Petitioner that Chelcey would
 testify at trial that she had a telephone conversation with
 Petitioner during which Petitioner said, “‘I’m sorry, I apologize
 to you and your family. I’m sorry for what happened,’” and “‘I
 made a mistake.’” The conversation took place over a year after
 the incident and approximately a week-and-a-half before trial.
 
On February 4, 2010, the court held a hearing on the
 
Motion. Petitioner argued that although the statement was
 “obviously an admission[,]” HRE Rule 409.5 prohibits the
 admission of apologies unless the apology implies fault. 
Respondent maintained that, “it’s so clear [the statement made by
 Petitioner] implies fault which is what . . . [HRE Rule] 409.5
 allows” to be admitted into evidence--“an apology [that] . . .
 implies fault.” Respondent noted, however, that “[t]he
 legislature’s intent was more . . . for [HRE Rule 409.5] to be a
 civil . . . statute; was more [to] . . . not hinder healing
 ritual. . . . It appears [that] the legislature’s intent was to
 allow individuals and an entity to express sympathy and
 condolences without the expressions being [used] to establish
 civil liability.” 
As to Canady, Petitioner argued that Canady prohibits
 
the admission of an apology unless “accompanied with facts”
 indicating that the apology was an admission “to a fact at
 issue.” Petitioner explained that otherwise, “you don’t really
 know what [the defendant] is apologizing for. . . . It’s like you
 can be sorry this situation happened; you can be sorry for a lot
 
4
         
       
          
            
            
       
           
       
           
         
          ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
of things.” The court apparently agreed that an apology could
 
encompass different reasons: 
It’s just common sense, [Respondent] said in [ Canady]--it
claimed the relevancy of the apology, if he did something to
someone, you felt badly or felt it was wrong you do want to
apologize. . . . [But if] no reason is given as to why
[Petitioner] wanted to apologize[, t]he apology statement is
bereft of a fact stated which would tie the apology to the
violated conduct because [Petitioner] did not indicate what
his apology was for. His apology could relate to any number
 of circumstances. Hence the meaning is open and ambiguous
. . . [and] the apology would not amount to substantial
evidence.
 
Respondent contended, however, that the instant case
 
was distinguishable from Canady because “it’s not speculative or
 
ambiguous as to what in fact [Petitioner was] talking about. It
 tie[d] the conduct as to exactly what [he was] talking about. . .
 . [I]t appear[ed] both the witness as well as [Petitioner] kn[ew]
 exactly what each other [was] talking about. There is no
 ambiguity.” Petitioner countered, “There’s no ambiguity as to
 what [] incident [] they[ were] talking about” but there is an
 ambiguity “as to what the mistake [was].” [Id. at 21] 
The court ruled at the close of the hearing that only
 
that portion of Petitioner’s statement regarding having “made a
 big mistake” was admissible. The court appeared to view HRE Rule
 409.5 as prohibiting the admission of “[e]vidence of statements
 or gestures that express sympathy, commiseration or condolences
 concerning the consequences of an event in which the declarant
 was a participant[,]” but as not requiring the “exclusion of an
 apology or other statement that acknowledges or implies fault
 even though contained in part” of the apology. The court
 reasoned that the phrase “I’m so sorry” was an expression of
 sympathy but that “I made a big mistake” was not:
 
5
         
           
   
          And  I
 
         
         
     
           
   
        
           
         
             
        
           
           
          
            
          
          
         
           
       
   
         
         
          
         
   
        
           
         
         
   
        
         
             
             ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Okay, I’m going to allow in “I made a big mistake.”
 
That’s all. That’s  the  on ly  part  of  that  that  I  am  going  to
 
let in
. The rest look [sic] like sympathy. 
understand the position that may create a record for appeal,
but seems to me that’s more than –- than sympathy,
commiseration, or condolences in the context .
 
(Emphases added.) Defense counsel maintained that the entire
 
statement was inadmissible:
 
THE  COURT:   If  you  want  the  whole  thing  in,  you  can
probably  get  it  in,  [defense  counsel],  as  part  of  an  effort
to  simply  apologize  or  commiserate,  but  that’s  –- that’s  the
 
court’s  ruling.  .  .  .  You  might  want  to  get  the  whole  thing
in  to  show  he’s  just  trying  to  offer  a  human  common  sense
apologies  [sic]  for  the  family  upset,  but  I  don’t  want  to
let that all in . . . unless you want it in.
 
. . . .
 
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: -- and that’s the exact ruling
[sic] why they don’t let that kind of stuff in because it
could just be a healing statement, you know, that’s out
there for that reason. So that is the exact reason . . .
 
you don’t piecemeal this thing[.] . . .
THE COURT: –- Well, that’s -- find me some more case
 
law, but right now he says, “I’m sorry for what happened” -­
referencing this incident and that I might not let in, but
he says, “I made a big mistake.” -- To me, that’s beyond
 just saying “I’m sorry for what happened. My condolences.”
So that’s the court’s ruling and you have an issue for
appeal.
 
(Emphases added.)
 
B.
 
At trial, the defense asserted that Petitioner struck
 
Emil in defense of himself and his family. Defense counsel
 
stated during his opening statement as follows: 
When Emil [] got hit, he was angry, he was
intoxicated, and he was getting out of control. This is a
 
case about [Petitioner] defending himself and his family .
 
. . . .
 
At some point during [the argument between Emil and
Virgil Tamayo (Virgil)], Emil is the first one to use
physical force against Kui. Emil takes Kui, tells Kui to
get out of the way, and shoves him.
 
. . . .
 There’s going to be some differences in testimony, but
the end result is, is that when the dust settles and the
smoke clears, is that Emil has a busted-up jaw, [Petitioner]
has a busted-up nose and a laceration to his lip.
 
. . . .
 Although it won’t be clear exactly the sequences and
how everything happened, one thing that will be clear, it
was Emil who was the one who was angry, Emil was the one who
was upset, who was out of control, and it was Emil who was
 
6
         
            
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the first person to use physical force, and that was with a shove
to Kui.
 
(Emphasis added.) 
C.
 
The following relevant testimony was adduced at trial. 
Chelcey testified that a first birthday party was held for her
 
son on August 2, 2008. At approximately 9:30 or 10:00 p.m.,
 while standing in the reception hall, she observed her uncle Emil
 and neighbor Virgil arguing in the parking lot, which was
 approximately 30 to 35 feet from the reception hall. Emil and
 Virgil were shouting and cursing at one another loudly.
 
Chelcey stated that as she was standing near the door
 
of the hall, Petitioner walked past her to the parking lot and
 struck Emil. Emil fell to the ground. While others called
 “911,” Chelcey ran to the parking lot, and when she approached
 Emil, she noticed “[b]lood coming from the back of [Emil’s]
 head.” Chelcey believed Emil was unconscious for approximately
 twenty minutes. According to Chelcey, Emil did not see
 Petitioner walking toward him before Petitioner struck him.
 
Kui testified that he was standing near the parking lot
 
when he observed Emil and Virgil arguing. As he attempted to
 “split [Emil and Virgil] apart,” Emil “pushed [him] off” and said
 “get off me.” Kui “had to step back” as a result but did not
 “fall[] to the ground.” Because he could tell Emil “was mad,”
 Kui “backed off.” Kui stated that he did not call out for help. 
Kui then moved aside, approximately twelve feet away
 
from Emil and Virgil. Emil and Virgil continued to argue for “a
 
7
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
minute or so” and Kui saw Emil get “hit on his side” by his
 
uncle, Petitioner. Emil fell to the ground. Kui approached
 Petitioner and pushed him because he was “mad at [him].”
 
Virgil testified that he and Emil got into a
 
“disagreement” in the parking lot. He related that it was
 “[j]ust [a] verbal” disagreement and did not get physical at any
 point. After the disagreement had ended, Virgil saw a “figure”
 walk towards Emil. Virgil finished his conversation with Emil
 and turned away from Emil, and when Virgil turned back, he saw
 Emil on the ground. Virgil did not see the face of the person
 who approached Emil.
 
Emil’s brother Erik Kruse (Erik) was also a guest at
 
the party. Toward the end of the party, Erik’s girlfriend told
 him that Emil was arguing with another person in the parking lot. 
Erik testified that he went to the parking lot and saw Emil and
 Virgil arguing. Kui approached and told Emil, “[D]on’t uncle[,]”
 “it’s my son’s party[.]” In response, Emil told Kui, “Brah, this
 nothing [sic] to do with you, mind your own business.” When Kui
 attempted to intervene, Emil “escorted” Kui to the side; there
 was “no shove, no nothing.” “He just [] held him to the side,
 like, . . . ‘it’s not your problem.’” Kui did not fall to the
 ground or stumble as a result. As Emil and Virgil continued to
 argue, Petitioner walked up to Emil and “whack[ed] him in the
 face[.]” Immediately thereafter, Erik heard Kui say, “No uncle,
 no. Why?” Emil was “out cold,” “convulsing” and “blood was
 coming out of his head.” According to Erik, Emil was “out cold .
 . . for awhile.” 
8
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Emil testified that he and Virgil were in a
 
confrontation because Emil’s son, Chauncey, and Virgil’s son,
 
Tyler, had been in an argument about a girl. Emil and Virgil
 began arguing because Emil confronted Tyler and Virgil
 intervened. Emil stated that the confrontation was merely verbal
 and not physical. According to Emil, he and Virgil did not
 challenge each other to a fight, but Emil admitted that the
 conversation was “heated.” Emil remembered Kui arriving at the
 scene but did not recall Kui breaking up the argument, nor did
 Emil remember shoving Kui.
 
Petitioner testified that he heard a great deal of
 
yelling coming from the parking lot. When he looked towards the
 parking lot, he saw his nephew, Kui, and other people he did not
 know. Some of them were yelling and one individual was “jumping
 up and down.” Since Kui was standing between Emil and Virgil,
 Petitioner walked to the parking lot because he was concerned
 about Kui’s safety. Petitioner reported that Kui was four to
 five feet from Emil when Emil shoved Kui. After Petitioner saw
 Emil shove Kui, Emil and Virgil continued to argue for another
 minute or so when Petitioner struck Emil.
 
D.
 
At trial, both Chelcey and Petitioner testified
 
regarding the conversation that was the subject of the Motion. 
Chelcey stated that approximately “a week-and-a-half” prior to
 trial, she received a telephone call from Petitioner. She
 reported that during the conversation, the subject incident came
 up and Petitioner indicated that he had made a big mistake:
 
9
         
       
            
  
  
       
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Q: And during this conversation, [Petitioner] –
 
correct me if I’m wrong – indicated to you that he had made
 a big mistake?”
A: Correct.
 
Q: He said this approximately four times?
 
A: Yes.
 
Petitioner testified that prior to trial, his
 
girlfriend called Chelcey and Kui’s residence because Petitioner
 
wanted to speak with Kui about assisting him in finding a job. 
He admitted that when the incident came up in the conversation,
 he told Chelcey that he “‘made a big mistake.’” When asked what
 he meant by this Petitioner responded, “What I mean by I made a
 mistake is that I made a mistake by, you know, punch [her] uncle,
 stuff like that. I didn’t mean anything else besides that. I
 mean, what I mean by I made a mistake, by doing that to the party
 and stuff like that. I didn’t mean anything.” He further
 explained, “I made a mistake by doing that to [her] uncle. I
 didn’t mean to do that. Everybody was make [sic] a mistake over
 there, not only me point finger at [sic].” Petitioner affirmed
 that he “didn’t mean to hurt [Chelcey’s] uncle[.]”
 
E.
 
On February 11, 2010, the jury found Petitioner guilty
 
of the included offense of Assault in the Second Degree, HRS §
 707-711. An Amended Judgment of Conviction and Sentence was
 entered on April 20, 2010, adjudging Petitioner guilty and
 sentencing him to five years of imprisonment, with credit for
 time served. 
II.
 
Petitioner filed his Notice of Appeal on May 19, 2010. 
Pertinent to his Application, on appeal to the ICA, Petitioner
 
10
         
         
    
      
     
       
      
     ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
challenged the court’s ruling with respect to the statements,
 
“I’m so sorry. I made a big mistake.”6 [Opening Brief (OB) at
 
17-19] The ICA determined that the court did not err in
 admitting Petitioner’s statement that he “‘made a big mistake’”
 into evidence. Lealao, 2011 WL 4357741, at *2. First, the ICA
 
reasoned that the statement “was relevant and admissible as
 probative evidence of his consciousness of guilt and that his use
 of force was not justified[,]” noting that “[i]t was for the jury
 to decide what weight to give to this evidence.” Id.
 
Second, the ICA held that Petitioner’s reliance on 
Canady was misplaced. The ICA viewed Canady as deciding that the defendant’s apology to the complainant in that case was insufficient to support his conviction for abuse of a family or household member. Id. at *3 (citing Canady, 80 Hawai' i at 475, 
911 P.2d at 110) But, according to the ICA, “evidence may be relevant and admissible without being sufficient to establish a material element of a charged offense.” Id. (citing State v. 
Wallace, 80 Hawai' i 382, 409-10, 910 P.2d 695, 722-23 (1996)). 
The ICA also noted that the court relied on HRE Rule
 
409.5 in ruling that only the portion of Petitioner’s statement
 regarding having “made a big mistake” was admissible. The ICA
 
6
 In his Opening Brief, Petitioner also presented three other issues
 
not raised in his Application:
 
1.	 The district [sic] court erred in disallowing
[Petitioner]’s request for a mutual affray
instruction.
 
2.	 There was insufficient evidence to support the jury’s
verdict.
 
3.	 [Petitioner]’s conviction should be vacated because he
received ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
11
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
acknowledged in a footnote that “[i]t is not clear that HRE Rule
 
409.5 applies to criminal cases[,]” since the rule and its
 commentary “indicate that the rule may be directed at the
 admissibility of evidence in civil cases.” Id. at *3 n.4. 
Nevertheless, the ICA stated, “For purposes of our analysis in
 this case, we assume[,] without deciding[,] that HRE Rule 409.5
 is applicable.” Id.
 
III.
 
Petitioner lists the following question in his
 
Application: “Whether the ICA gravely erred when it held that
 the [court] properly admitted [Petitioner’s] pretrial statement
 to a relative that he had ‘made a big mistake.’” Respondent
 filed a Response to Petitioner’s Application on January 31, 2012
 (Response).
 
IV.
 
A.
 
In connection with the question raised in his
 
Application, Petitioner argues that the ICA incorrectly concluded
 the “made a mistake” statement was admissible because (1) the
 statement was not relevant, (2) even if it was relevant, the
 statement was not admissible as a party admission, and (3) the
 court’s ruling admitting the statement was not harmless beyond a
 reasonable doubt. 
First, Petitioner asserts that the statement was not
 
relevant to “whether he intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly
 caused serious bodily injury to another” or to whether he had a
 “consciousness of guilt” because the statement “I made a big
 
12
          
         
            
          
            
   
          
            
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
mistake” “can have many meanings[,]” (citing Canady, 80 Hawai' i 
at 469, 911 P.2d at 104), and the statement was too remote in 
being made “over a year after the alleged incident.” He maintains that because his statement was not relevant, the question of whether the statement was a party admission under HRE 
7
Rule 803(a)(1) (2010),  that “is not excluded by the hearsay
8
]” need not be considered.
 rule, [HRE Rule 802 (2010), 
Second, Petitioner contends that, assuming the subject 
statement was relevant, it was not a party admission under HRE Rule 803(a)(1) because “‘it [was] not evident . . . that the apology was an admission to a criminal act[,]’” or tied to “violative conduct.” 
(Quoting Canady, 80 Hawai' i at 475, 911 
P.2d at 110.) 
Third, Petitioner contends the court’s error in
 
admitting the statement was not harmless beyond a reasonable
 doubt because the statement was of a “confessional nature” and
 such “damning evidence” that there is a reasonable possibility
 its admission contributed to his conviction.
 
B.
 
In its Response, Respondent notes as to Petitioner’s
 
first argument that “‘[a]ll relevant evidence is admissible[.]’” 
(Quoting HRE Rule 402 (2010).) According to Respondent, a jury
 
7
 HRE Rule 803(a)(1) provides that a party admission is “[a]
 
statement that is offered against a party and is (A) the party’s own
statement, in either the party’s individual or a representative capacity, or
(B) a statement of which the party has manifested the party’s adoption or
belief in its truth.”
 
8
 HRE Rule 802 provides that “[h]earsay is not admissible except as 
provided by [the HRE], or by other rules prescribed by the Hawai 'i supreme 
court, or by statute.” 
13
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
could have determined that Petitioner said he “made a big
 
mistake” because he hurt Chelcey’s uncle, Emil; erred in
 believing that punching Emil was necessary to protect himself or
 his family; or intended to “garner Chelcey’s sympathy” prior to
 trial. But, Respondent urges that the fact Petitioner’s
 statement may have many meanings does not render it inadmissible. 
Respondent points out that Petitioner does not contest “a
 possible meaning attributable to his statement was that he
 acknowledged being at fault.”
 
As to Petitioner’s second argument, Respondent argues 
the “record makes clear that Petitioner intended his statement to relate to the assault for which he stood trial.” As to Petitioner’s third argument, Respondent contends that even if the court erred in admitting the statement, such error was harmless because the record demonstrates that Petitioner was not acting in self defense. Also, Petitioner could not have been justified in punching Emil “purportedly to protect Kui” because Kui had no “cause to use force against [Emil.]” (Citing State v. Mark, 123 Hawai'i 205, 221-31, 231 P.3d 478, 494-504 (2010)). 
V.
 A.
 
Petitioner maintained throughout the proceedings that
 
the statement “I’m so sorry, I made a big mistake” was
 inadmissible. As indicated, while excluding “I’m so sorry,” the
 court determined that “‘I made a big mistake’” appeared to be
 “more than . . . sympathy, commiseration, or condolences in the
 context” and thus admitted that portion of Petitioner’s
 
14
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
statement. It appears that the court was relying on HRE Rule
 
409.5 inasmuch as its ruling was couched in the language of that
 rule. See HRE 409.5 (providing that evidence of expressions of
 
“sympathy, commiseration, or condolence” are inadmissible but
 that “exclusion of an apology or other statement that
 acknowledges or implies fault even though contained in, or part
 of, any statement or gesture” are not excludable under the rule). 
However, the plain language of HRE Rule 409.5 excludes
 
expressions of sympathy, commiseration, or condolence “to prove
 liability,” as opposed to proving a defendant’s guilt. (Emphasis
 added.) Therefore, the text of HRE Rule 409.5 itself suggests
 that the rule was not intended to apply in a criminal context. 
The commentary, like the plain language of HRE Rule 409.5, does
 not mention criminal proceedings. The commentary explains that
 the rule “favors expressions of sympathy as embodying desirable
 social interactions and contributing to civil settlements, and
 the evidentiary exclusion recognizes that the law should
 ‘facilitate or, at least, not hinder the possibility of this
 healing ritual.’” (Quoting Jennifer K. Robbennolt, Apologies and
 Legal Settlement: An Empirical Examination, 102 Mich. L. Rev.
 460, 474 (2003).) (Emphasis added.) 
Also, the commentary notes that HRE Rule 409.5
 
“resembles measures recently adopted in several sister states[,]” 
citing as an example, California Evidence Code section 1160,
 which confines its application to the civil context. See Cal.
 
Evid. Code 1160(a) (West 2011) (providing that any “portion of
 statements, writings, or benevolent gestures expressing sympathy

or a general sense of benevolence relating to the pain,
 
suffering, or death of a person involved in an accident and made
 to that person or to the family of that person shall be
 inadmissible as evidence of an admission of liability in a civil
 action”) (emphases added).

In addition, the legislative history confirms that HRE
 
Rule 409.5 applies only in civil actions. The original purpose
 of the measure proposed to the legislature was “to make
 benevolent gestures inadmissible as evidence of an admission of
 liability in medical malpractice claims.” S. Stand. Comm. Rep.
 No. 1131, in 2007 Senate Journal, at 1535. However, the

Delaware Code § 4318 (providing that “[a]ny and all statements, writings,
gestures, or affirmations made by a health care provider or an employee of a
health care provider that express apology . . ., sympathy, compassion,
condolence, or benevolence . . . are inadmissible in a civil action that is
brought against a health care provider”) (emphasis added); Iowa Code § 9-207
(providing that, “[ i]n any civil action brought by or on behalf of a patient

Michigan Compiled Laws Annotated § 600.2155 (providing that “[a] statement,
writing, or action that expresses sympathy, compassion, commiseration, or a
general sense of benevolence relating to the pain, suffering, or death of an

(emphasis added); Nebraska Revised Statutes § 27-1201 (providing that “ [i]n

medical care, or in any arbitration proceeding related to such civil action,
any and all statements, affirmations, gestures, or conduct expressing apology,

legislature “found it appropriate to allow individuals and
 
entities to express sympathy and condolence without the
 expression being used against the individual or entity to
 establish civil liability, even if the individual or entity is
 not a health care provider.” Id. (emphasis added). Thus, the
 
legislative committee deleted the provisions “confin[ing] the
 bill to civil actions against health care providers, and
 benevolent gestures made to a patient or patient’s family,” and
 made the rule applicable in all civil actions. Id.
 
Addison M. Bowman explains that HRE Rule 409.5 “was 
enacted by the 2007 Hawai' i Legislature with broad support,” 
including from the health-care industry, which views an expression of sympathy as “‘an important element in the healing process.’” Manual on the Hawai' i Rules of Evidence (hereinafter, 
“HRE Manual”) § 409.5-1 (Supp. 2011) (quoting Jonathan Todres, Toward Healing and Restoration for All: Refraining Medical Malpractice Reform, 39 Conn. L. Rev. 667, 710 (2006)). Such “expressions of sympathy . . . may contribute to civil settlements.” HRE Manual § 409.5-1 (citing Commentary to HRE Rule 409.5) (emphasis added). 
It is clear from the plain language of HRE Rule 409.5,
 
its commentary, and its legislative history that the rule does
 not preclude the admission of expressions of “sympathy,
 commiseration, or condolence” in criminal cases, and the court
 erred in assuming that it did. To the extent the ICA concluded
 that it was within the court’s discretion to exclude the “I’m so
 sorry” portion of Petitioner’s statement, but admit the “I made a
 
17
         
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
big mistake” portion, based on the “assum[ption]” that HRE Rule
 
409.5 is applicable” in criminal cases, Lealao, No. 30502, 2011
 WL 4357741, at *3, the ICA gravely erred. 
B. 
The court may have also relied on Canady in excluding 
the “I’m so sorry” portion of Petitioner’s statement, as evidenced by the court’s acknowledgment that an apology can have many meanings. In Canady, the ICA considered whether there was substantial evidence to support the defendant’s conviction for abuse of a family or household member. See Canady, 80 Hawai' i 
469, 474, 911 P.2d at 109. Among other evidence, the State relied upon the defendant’s statement that he wanted to go to the emergency room to apologize to his girlfriend. Id. at 475, 911 
P.2d at 110. 
Canady rejected the State’s assertion that the
 
defendant’s attempted “apology” constituted substantial evidence
 to support the defendant’s conviction. See id. Canady concluded
 
that, because “no reason [was] given as to why [the d]efendant
 wanted to apologize[,]” the “‘apology’ could [have] relate[d] to
 any number of circumstances” and its meaning was “open to
 speculation.” Id. The apology was “bereft of . . . facts” that
 
“would tie the apology to the violative conduct” with which the
 defendant had been charged, and it was not evident the apology
 “constitute[d] an admission that [the d]efendant committed the
 alleged crime” or a “criminal act.” Id. Thus, Canady decided
 
that the apology did not amount to substantial evidence 
18
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
supporting the defendant’s conviction for abuse of a family or
 
household member. Id.
 
Petitioner reads Canady as prohibiting the admission of
 
an apology unless it is clear the apology constituted an
 admission of a “criminal act” or the “violative conduct” for
 which the defendant is charged. But, as noted by the ICA, Canady
 is not a case regarding the admissibility of evidence. Rather,
 Canady was concerned with whether, under the facts of that case,
 the defendant’s attempt to apologize constituted substantial
 evidence of the offense for which the defendant was convicted.
 
It may be noted that Canady is also factually
 
distinguishable inasmuch as Petitioner stated that he had “made a
 big mistake,” and therefore arguably, Petitioner’s statement was
 unlike the bare apology in Canady. In any event, as discussed,
 the ICA was correct that “evidence may be relevant and admissible
 without being sufficient to establish a material element of a
 charged offense.” Lealao, 2011 WL 4357741, at *3.
 
C.
 
As elucidated by the foregoing, neither HRE Rule 409.5
 
nor Canady required exclusion of the “I’m so sorry” portion of
 Petitioner’s statement in this case. As to the admitted portion,
 “I made a big mistake,” that statement is susceptible to various
 interpretations. It did not necessarily mean that Petitioner was
 admitting fault for the charged conduct. By admitting only the
 portion of Petitioner’s statement regarding having “made a big
 mistake,” but excluding that portion regarding Petitioner being 
19
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
“sorry,” the jury was left without the context in which the
 
statement had been made. 
As a result, the jury may have been more inclined to
 
interpret the statement as Petitioner admitting to fault as
 opposed to an apology based simply on the fact that the incident
 occurred. Therefore, under the circumstances, the entire
 statement should have been admitted because, otherwise, the words
 “I made a big mistake” alone might be misleading. See State v.
 
Tucker, 10 Haw. App. 43, 67-68, 861 P.2d 24, 35 (1993)
 (concluding that the statement became “powerfully incriminating”
 in “the evidentiary context in which [they were] presented to the
 jury” and, thus, “should not have been admitted into evidence in
 the form presented to the jury”) (internal quotation marks
 omitted).
 
D. 
Petitioner did not ask for the phrase “I’m so sorry” to 
be admitted. Nor did Petitioner advance any argument at the hearing on the Motion, prior to trial, at trial, or on appeal, that the court’s exclusion of only “I’m so sorry” prejudiced him in any way. Consequently, any theory relating to the court’s separation of Petitioner’s statement may be said to be waived. See State v. Moses, 102 Hawai' i 449, 456, 77 P.3d 940, 947 (2004) 
(“As a general rule, if a party does not raise an argument at trial, that argument will be deemed to have been waived on appeal[.]”) 
In any event, even if Petitioner had argued that the
 
court’s exclusion of the “I’m so sorry” portion of his statement
 
20
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
was prejudicial or had the possibility of misleading the jury,
 
such error would be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in light
 of the fact that Petitioner himself explained his statement “I
 made a big mistake” to the jury. Petitioner told the jury that
 he “made a mistake by . . . punch[ing Emil]” and “doing that to
 the party.” He further stated, “I made a mistake by doing that
 to [Chelcey’s] uncle. I didn’t mean to do that. Everybody was
 [sic] make a mistake over there, not only me point finger at
 [sic]”; “I didn’t mean to hurt [her] uncle[.]” 
Hence, Petitioner’s testimony offered the jury an
 
explanation for the statement that essentially conveyed his
 regret that the incident occurred. It was for the jury to
 believe Petitioner or not. The jury’s rejection of Petitioner’s
 explanation for his statement is reflected in its verdict. See
 
State v. Gabrillo, 10 Haw. App. 448, 877 P.2d 891 (1994)
 (concluding that “the verdict represented the jury’s
 determination that [the d]efendant’s evidence was not believed,
 i.e., it did not raise any reasonable doubts of [the d]efendant's
 guilt and, on the other hand, that the State’s witnesses were
 believed”). In light of the foregoing, there is no reasonable
 possibility that the exclusion of the phrase “I’m so sorry”
 contributed to Petitioner’s conviction. Accordingly, the court’s
 error in excluding part of Petitioner’s statement was harmless
 beyond a reasonable doubt.
 
VI.
 
A.
 
As indicated, Petitioner’s first contention is that the
 
21
         
           
           
           
            
             
       
        
         
       
       
       ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
statement he made to Chelcey was not relevant to any material
 
fact in this case. The ICA determined the statement was
 probative in establishing that Petitioner’s use of force was not
 justified. HRE Rule 401 (1993) provides that “[r]elevant
 evidence” is “evidence having any tendency to make the existence
 of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the
 action more probable or less probable than it would be without
 the evidence.”
 
In the instant case, Petitioner defended against the 
charge by arguing that his conduct was justified because he believed punching Emil was necessary to protect himself and Kui. Self-defense and defense of others are not affirmative defenses, and, thus, Respondent had the burden of disproving the defense beyond a reasonable doubt. See State v. Culkin, 97 Hawai' i 206, 
215, 35 P.3d 233, 242 (2001) (stating that “[s]elf-defense is not an affirmative defense, and the prosecution has the burden of disproving it [beyond a reasonable doubt] once evidence of justification has been adduced”). 
Self defense, HRS § 703-304 (2001),
10 or defense of
 
11
 others, HRS § 703-305 (1993),  depends on the actor’s belief
10 HRS § 703-304 provides that “the use of force upon or toward
 
another person is justifiable when the actor believes that such force is
immediately necessary for the purpose of protecting himself against the use of
unlawful force by the other person on the present occasion. (Emphasis added.)
 
11
 HRS § 703-305 states that the use of force upon or toward a person
 
is justifiable to protect a third person when
 
(a)	 Under the circumstances as the actor believes them to
 
be, the person whom the actor seeks to protect would
be justified in using such protective force; and
 
(b)	 The actor believes that the actor's intervention is
 
necessary for the protection of the other person.
 
22
         
  
 
 
        
             
            
            
            
              
             
      ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
that the use of force was necessary either to protect oneself or 
another. A defendant’s credibility, then, is at the crux of those defenses--the jury must determine whether the defendant did in fact subjectively believe the use of force was necessary. See 
State v. Walsh, 125 Hawai' i 271, 299, 260 P.3d 350, 378 (2011) 
(stating that “[the defendant’s] credibility was at the crux of [the defendant’s self-]defense” because “the jury is to decide whether the defendant was truthful about his subjective belief of the circumstances” surrounding his or her use of force). 
In the instant case, Petitioner does not deny having
 
struck Emil. Rather, he asserts that he did so because he
 believed it was necessary to protect himself and Kui. 
Petitioner’s statement would have the “tendency to make the
 existence of [a] fact that [was] of consequence to the
 determination of the action[,]” here, Petitioner’s belief that
 his use of force was necessary to protect himself or Kui, “more
 probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.” 
HRE Rule 401.
12
 
In light of the statement, the jury could have
 
determined that Petitioner did not reasonably believe his use of
 force against Emil was necessary. In other words, Petitioner may
 
(Emphases added.)
 
12
 Under some circumstances, an expression of sympathy or condolence
 
may not be relevant to establishing a material fact at issue in a criminal
case. In other instances, there may not be evidence establishing that a
particular statement related to the incident giving rise to a criminal charge.
Here, because Petitioner did not dispute that the statement “I’m so sorry, I
 made a big mistake” related to the August 2, 2008 incident, and in light of
the defense raised by Petitioner in this case, the statement was relevant to a
material fact at issue in the action.
 
23
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
not have admitted to making a “mistake” if he truly believed he
 
had been justified in striking Emil, thereby making his claim of
 self-defense less tenable. See Wallace v. State, 932 S.W.2d 345,
 
346-47 (Ark. App. 1996) (holding that evidence that “three weeks
 before the trial, [the defendant] had approached the victim at
 the same store where the robbery occurred, apologized to him,
 asked him to ‘go pretty easy on them,’ and . . . offered to ‘pay
 [the victim] some of his money back’” was relevant to show
 “knowledge of [the defendant’s] guilt”). Hence, Petitioner’s
 statement was relevant in that it made Petitioner’s assertion
 that he believed the use of force was necessary more or less
 probable than it would be without the statement.
 
B.
 
Petitioner also maintains the statement was not
 
relevant because it could “have many meanings” and, also, because
 it was made over a year after the incident occurred. Petitioner
 cites to no authority for the foregoing assertions. HRE Rule 402
 requires only that evidence have “any tendency to make the
 existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination
 of the action more probable or less probable than it would be
 without the evidence.” (Emphasis added.) Here, the statement
 was relevant in evaluating Petitioner’s asserted belief that his
 use of force was justified. Once admitted into evidence, it was
 for the jury to decide what effect to give the statement. 
VII.
 
Petitioner’s second contention is that even if the
 
evidence was relevant, it did not constitute a party admission,
 
24
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
under HRE Rule 803(a)(1) because “‘it [was] not evident . . . 
that the apology was an admission to a criminal act.’” (Quoting Canady, 80 Hawai' i at 475, 911 P.2d at 110.) HRE Rule 803 
provides that party admissions “are not excluded by the hearsay rule.” As indicated, a party admission is a statement made by a party and offered against the party. HRE Rule 803(a)(1). 
Petitioner is mistaken that a party admission must be 
an admission to a criminal act to be admissible. The HRE Manual explains that “[t]he word ‘admission’ is a term of art embracing any statement made or adopted by or fairly attributable to a party[.]” HRE Manual § 803-2. “The extrajudicial statements of 
a party-opponent, when offered against the same, are universally deemed admissible at trial as substantive evidence of the fact or facts stated.” Kekua v. Kaiser Found. Hosp., 61 Haw. 208, 217 
n.3, 601 P.2d 364, 371 n.3 (1979). As the commentary to HRE Rule 803(a) explains, in order to admit a statement as a party admission, the statement need only be (1) “relevant,” (2) “made by a party to the litigation,” and (3) “offered against that party.’” “[T]here is no requirement that an admission ‘admit’ anything or convey information against the interest of the declarant.” HRE Manual § 803-2; see also State v. Espiritu, 117 
Hawai'i 127, 132-33, 176 P.3d 885, 890-91 (2008). 
In Espiritu, the defendant challenged his conviction
 
for, inter alia, attempted murder in the second degree. Id. at
 
129, 176 P.3d at 887. The defendant allegedly shot the
 complainant, with whom he had had a “dating” or “sexual
 relationship,” after finding her with another male. Id. at 130,
 
25
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
176 P.3d at 888. Among other things, Petitioner challenged the
 
admissibility of text messages he had sent to the complainant. 
Id. The complainant testified that she received the following
 
text messages from the defendant: (1) “‘The true face shows, I
 guess, all the brothers and sisters were right’”; (2) “‘You
 should have talked to me, but you're too pig-headed for our kind. 
There’s a new message going out to the locals’”; (3) “I'm tired
 of being the sucker. What goes around comes around”; and (4) “I
 have to say I’m so, so sorry.” Id. at 131-32, 176 P.3d at 889-90
 
(brackets omitted). 
Espiritu noted the defendant had conceded that the
 
actual text messages as opposed to Petitioner’s testimony “would
 arguably be admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule as an
 admission by a party-opponent under HRE [Rule] 803(a)(1).” Id.
 
at 132, 176 P.3d at 890. We concluded that the text messages did
 “qualify as statements offered by [the State] against [the
 defendant] to show [the defendant’s] history of threats against
 the [c]omplainant and, hence, were admissions by a party-opponent
 under HRE Rule 803(a)(1).” Id. at 133, 176 P.3d at 891. 
Espiritu noted that “[t]he HRE Rule 803(a)(1) exception for party
 admissions does not require that the statement be against
 interest when made.” Id. at 133 n.5, 176 P.3d at 891 n.5; see
 
also Kekua, 61 Haw. at 216 n.3, 601 P.2d at 370 n.3 (in
 distinguishing “‘party admissions[]’” from “‘statements against
 interest[,]’” noting that “the latter is considered to be an
 exception to the hearsay rule and therefore admissible under 
26
         
        
          
           
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
certain circumstances[;] the modern view treats party admissions
 
as being outside the scope of the exclusionary rule”).
 
As previously discussed, the statement at issue in this 
case was relevant. As in Espiritu, the statement “I’m so sorry, I made a big mistake” “qualif[ied] as statements offered by [Respondent] against [Petitioner]” to negate Petitioner’s claim that he believed his use of force was justified “and, hence, were admissions by a party-opponent under HRE Rule 803(a)(1),” 117 Hawai'i at 133, 176 P.3d at 891, and admissible.

 Because Petitioner’s statement was both relevant and admissible as
 
a party admission, Petitioner’s third contention, that the court’s error in
admitting the statement was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, need not
be addressed.
