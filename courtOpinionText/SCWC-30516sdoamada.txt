CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
(ICA NO. 30516; CASE NO. 1DTA-10-00706)
 
AMENDED SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER1
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Duffy, and McKenna, JJ.;
with Acoba, J., dissenting)
 
Petitioner Lawrence Pai (“Pai”) seeks review of the
 
Intermediate Court of Appeal’s July 14, 2011 Judgment on Appeal,
 
entered pursuant to its June 14, 2011 Summary Disposition Order,
 which affirmed the District Court of the First Circuit’s April 9,
 2010 Order and Notice of Entry of Order. The District Court
 adjudged Pai guilty of Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of
 
an Intoxicant, in violation of Hawai' i Revised Statutes (“HRS”)

§ 291E-61(a)(3)(2007).2 We accepted Pai’s application for writ
 
of certiorari and now affirm the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal.
 
On certiorari, Pai contends that the ICA gravely erred
 
in holding that mens rea need not be alleged in an HRS § 291E­
61(a)(3) charge. In State v. Nesmith, we agreed that mens rea
 need not be alleged (or proven) in an HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) charge,
 as the legislative intent to impose absolute liability for an HRS
 § 291E-61(a)(3) offense plainly appears. State v. Nesmith, ____
 
Hawai'i ___, ___ P.3d ____ (2012). Therefore, the ICA did not 
gravely err in so holding.
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the ICA’S Judgment on Appeal
 
is affirmed.
