OPINION OF THE COURT BY MCKENNA, J.
 
I. Introduction
 
This court accepted Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant Joseph
 
1
Pitts' Application for Writ of Certiorari  and ordered
We did not accept certiorari for the purpose of addressing Pitts'
 
question presented, as the record does not support Pitts' allegation of error. 
We accepted certiorari for the purpose of addressing the question posed to the
parties for supplemental briefing.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
supplemental briefing addressing whether the circuit court erred
 
in not appointing substitute counsel for Pitts for post-verdict
 
2
motions and sentencing. We hold that the circuit court erred by
not appointing substitute counsel for Pitts' post-verdict motions
 because post-verdict proceedings are critical stages in the
 prosecution. 
We also hold that the circuit court erred by not
 
appointing Pitts substitute counsel for sentencing.
 II. Background
 Pitts was tried for attempted murder in the second degree. 
Pitts was alleged to have stabbed his close friend.
 
After opening statements, Pitts expressed a desire to
 
represent himself. John 
Schum ("Schum"), Pitts' fourth court-
appointed attorney (appointed after Pitts had developed personal
 conflicts with his three preceding court-appointed attorneys),
 who represented Pitts at that point, stated the problem was Pitts
 believed "he knows the case better than [Schum] do[es] and that
 the truth will set him free." The circuit court asked Pitts to
 think about his decision over the weekend. The following Monday,
 before trial resumed, Pitts informed the circuit court that he
 would "push [his] stubbornness aside" and have Schum continue
 representing him. 
The Honorable Glenn J. Kim presided.

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Later, during a break in the State's case, Pitts again
 
announced his intention to fire Schum. After giving Pitts a day
 
to think about his decision, the circuit court colloquied Pitts
 regarding his right to counsel, Pitts waived his right to
 counsel, and Schum was assigned as standby counsel. There were
 no express limits on the time frame for which Schum would act as
 standby counsel (i.e., through trial, through post-trial motions,
 through sentencing, through appeal, etc.).
 
As the State's case progressed, Pitts expressed to the court
 
(outside the presence of the jury) that he wanted Schum to resume
 representing him because he (Pitts) was overwhelmed. Schum
 stated that he was not sure he could resume representation
 because of the ethical problem caused by Pitts' accusation that
 Schum and the prosecutor "shar[ed] privileged information and
 attempt[ed] to sell [Pitts out]." The circuit court denied
 Pitts' request to have Schum resume representation for two
 reasons: first, because of Schum's perceived ethical problem,
 and second, because "the bottom line is . . . that [Pitts] waived
 [his] right to counsel." For the rest of the trial, Pitts was
 pro se.
 
On March 10, 2010, the jury returned a guilty verdict. 
On March 17, 2010, Schum filed a timely Motion to Withdraw
 
as Stand-by Counsel, Appoint Substitute Counsel and Declare
 
3
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Mistrial. In his declaration attached to the motion, Schum
 
explained that Pitts had asked for Schum's help in requesting a
 new trial, preparing for the sentencing hearing, and starting
 work on an appeal. According to Schum, he told Pitts resuming
 representation was not possible because Pitts had waived his
 right to counsel and accused Schum of ethical violations. Schum
 contacted the Office of Disciplinary Counsel, who advised him
 that it would be possible for Schum to file the instant motion so
 long as Pitts concurred so that Pitts' "full rights both post-
trial and on appeal would be preserved. . . ." Pitts concurred. 
Thus, the motion requested that Schum be allowed to withdraw as
 standby counsel, that substitute counsel be appointed to assist
 Pitts post-trial and on appeal, and that a mistrial be declared
 because Pitts' waiver of the right to counsel was involuntary. 
The State filed its Opposition on April 5, 2010, arguing that
 Pitts made a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to
 counsel. 
On April 7, 2010, the circuit court heard the motion. 
Addressing Schum, the circuit court stated that Schum's services
 as standby counsel ended when the jury rendered its verdict:
 
First of all, I don't think it was required of you to file a
motion to withdraw as standby counsel.  You no longer
 represent Mr. Pitts.  The very fact that I asked you to be
standby counsel at trial tells us that.  Mr. Pitts waived
 his right to counsel very clearly, as [the State] said.  To
 this day, he's still representing himself.  The trial is
 over.  I think we'd all agree on that.  So you're no longer
 
4
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
standby counsel.  I don't think you need to file a motion to
withdraw as standby counsel.
 
The circuit court also opined that Schum might not have standing
 
to file a motion to appoint substitute counsel. In any event,
 the circuit court denied the motion for a mistrial (construed as
 a motion for a new trial), both on the merits, stating, "Mr.
 Pitts waived his right to counsel very clearly," and because it
 "[did not] think [Schum had] standing to bring [the motion]." 
The circuit court then directed Pitts to file any post-trial
 
motions pro se. The circuit court stated that it would consider
 any motion for a new trial filed by Pitts to be timely, even
 though filed beyond ten days after the jury delivered its
 
verdict.3 Pitts expressed a desire to be represented by counsel
 
for sentencing and appeal, and the circuit court directed him to
 make those requests in his own motions. 
The day after the hearing, Pitts filed five post-verdict
  
motions pro se:   (1) Motion to Set A[s]ide Verdict and Enter
 
[Judgment] of Acquittal Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure Rule
 29(c) or in the Alternative Grant Defendant New Trial HRPP Rule
 
The circuit court was not authorized to extend Pitts' deadline for a 
motion for a new trial in this way.  Hawai �i Rules of Penal Procedure ("HRPP")
Rule 45(b) (2010) states, "[T]he court may not extend the time for taking any
action under [Rule] 33. . . except and under the conditions stated in [it.]" Under HRPP Rule 33 (2010), a motion for a new trial "shall be made within 10days after verdict or finding of guilty or within such further time as thecourt may fix during the 10-day period."  The jury rendered its verdict on March 10, 2010.  The hearing on April 7, 2010 took place 28 days after the verdict.  Therefore, the circuit court violated HRPP Rule 45(b) by allowingPitts to file a pro se motion for new trial beyond the ten-day deadline setforth in HRPP Rule 33.

THE COURT: *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
33 HRS § 635-56; (2) Motion for New Trial or in the Alternative
 
Motion for Mistrial; (3) Motion to be Appointed Counsel for
 Sentencing and Appeal; (4) Motion for Psychiatric Evaluation 3
 Panel; and (5) Request for Continuance. On May 12, 2010, the
 circuit court held a hearing on Pitts' motions. The circuit
 court reiterated that Schum "has nothing to do with [Pitts'] case
 at this point. [Pitts is] pro se. [Pitts] waived counsel." At
 this hearing, Pitts repeatedly implored the circuit court for an
 attorney. 
First, the following exchange took place after the circuit
 
court asked if Pitts had anything to add to his Motion to Set
 Aside Verdict and Enter Judgment of Acquittal:
 
MR. PITTS:  Your Honor, first I would like to say I would
like 
an attorney, but if I can't –- I can't do this by
myself.  I really need an attorney.
 
 We'll get to that motion.  I'm not going to give
you an attorney for your sentencing today nor for these
motions.  You filed them pro se.  You've been pro se.  It's
 your motion.
 
Second, the following exchange took place after the circuit court
 
asked if Pitts had anything to add to his Motion for New Trial,
 or in the alternative, Motion for Mistrial:
 
MR. PITTS:  Your Honor, again, as you can see you've just
denie
d all my motions.  I can't do this.  I need an attorney
to help me, and the more you dismiss things, the more it
shows me that I need an attorney.
 
THE COURT: 
 Mr. Pitts, we're going to get to your motion for
an attorney.
 
MR. PITTS:  I mean like now.
 
6
   
  
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
THE COURT:
 No.  No.  You've waived counsel and you're pro
se, and you didn't make a motion for the appointment of
another attorney, and I'm not sure I would have granted it
anyway.
 
Lastly, Pitts made the following remark after the circuit court
 
asked if Pitts had anything to add to his Motion for Psychiatric
 Evaluation or a 3 Panel: "All right, I made [a motion for a 3
 panel] which you're gonna probably dismiss, so I need an
 attorney." 
The circuit court did grant Pitts' motion for appointment of
 
appellate counsel. The circuit court entered its Judgment of
 Conviction and Sentence on May 12, 2010. Pitts, represented by
 appellate counsel, timely appealed. The ICA concluded that
 Pitts' appeal was without merit and affirmed his conviction.
 III. Discussion
 
A. The Parties' Supplemental Briefing
 
Pitts argues, "Appointment of counsel for an indigent is 
required at every stage of a criminal proceeding where substantial rights of a criminal accused may be affected." In support of his argument, he cites D'Ambrosio v. State, 112 
Hawai�i 446, 146 P.3d 606 (App. 2006). He continues, without 
citation, "The circuit court ignored the 'critical' stage of the 
post-verdict to sentencing part of the criminal proceedings against Pitts." He continues, without citation, "The post-verdict and sentencing time is still a critical part of the 
7
    
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
proceedings and hence Pitts was entitled to have counsel
 
appointed."
 
The State argues that the circuit court did not err by not
 
appointing substitute counsel post-verdict. The State cites to a
 federal habeas corpus case that ostensibly favors Pitts'
 position: Rodgers v. Marshall, 678 F.3d 1149, 1163 (9th Cir.
 2012)("It is 'clearly established federal law' that the post-
trial motion for new trial is a 'critical stage' that implicates
 the right to counsel, as is a defendant's right to re-assert the
 right to counsel during post-trial proceedings.")
4 The State
 
cited to Rodgers for the requirement that a defendant must make a
 timely request for representation. See Rodgers, 678 F.3d at 1163
 
("[T]rial courts cannot deny a defendant's timely request for
 representation without a sufficient reason.") (emphasis added).
 The State goes on to argue that Pitts' request for counsel for
 his post-verdict motions was untimely, having been made on the
 day those motions were heard, on May 12, 2010. Further, the
 State argues that Pitts "made abundantly clear that no attorney
 
The United States Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit on the
 
"clearly established federal law" holding only.  See Marshall v. Rodgers, 133
S.Ct. 1446, 1451 (2013)(per curiam)(holding that the Ninth Circuit may not
canvas other circuits' precedent to presume that a particular rule of law
would be clearly established Federal law if it were to be presented to the
Supreme Court of the United States).  For purposes of proceeding with its
analysis, the United States Supreme Court "assumed, without so holding" that
"after a defendant's valid waiver of his right to trial counsel under Faretta
[v. California, 422 U.S. 806 (1975)], a post-trial, pre[-]appeal motion for a
new trial is a critical stage of the prosecution."  Id. at 1449. 
8
 4   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
would suffice," pointing out that Pitts had been through four
 
court-appointed attorneys for trial. The State summed up Pitts
 behavior as "manipulative and abusive . . . amounting to bad
 faith." 
The State concluded that the circuit court did not err by
 
not appointing substitute counsel for Pitts for post-verdict
 motions and sentencing because Pitts waived his right to counsel
 during trial; the circuit court considered the timing of Pitts'
 request for counsel; the circuit court had no discretion in
 sentencing Pitts; and because the circuit court was aware of
 Pitts' behavior towards his attorneys. Alternatively, the State
 argued that if this court should hold that Pitts should have been
 appointed counsel for his post-verdict motions, "a remand for
 appointment of counsel should be limited to re-litigating Pitts'
 post-verdict motions and for sentencing." In support of this
 form of relief, the State cites Rodgers, 678 F.3d at 1164
 (citation omitted): "Regarding the right to counsel, we
 previously held that a habeas remedy should put the defendant
 back in the position he would have been in if the Sixth Amendment
 violation never occurred."
 
At oral argument, however, the State agreed that its
 
position was that a motion for a new trial was a critical stage
 in the prosecution. See

0559.html.
 
B. The Right to Counsel for Post-Verdict Proceedings
 
We sua sponte raise the issue of the right to counsel for
 
post-verdict motions, as Pitts did not raise the issue in his
 certiorari application. We do so, however, because the "right to
 counsel is an essential component of a fair trial[.]" State v.
 
Dickson, 4 Haw. App. 614, 618, 673 P.2d 1036, 1041 (1983). "The
 Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution
 guarantee to a person accused by the state of committing an
 offense the right to be represented by counsel at every critical
 stage of the prosecution." Reponte v. State, 57 Haw. 354, 361,
 
556 P.2d 577, 582 (1976)(citing United States v. Ash, 413 U.S.
 
300 (1973)). Article I, Section 14 of the Hawai� i Constitution 
also guarantees the accused the right to counsel. See id. ("In 
all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to 
. . . have the assistance of counsel for the accused's defense.") A "critical stage" of the prosecution is any stage where "potential substantial prejudice to defendant's rights inheres." State v. Masaniai, 63 Haw. 354, 359, 628 P.2d 1018, 1022 (1981)(citing United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 227 (1967)). 
In this appeal, two right to counsel principles have come to
 
a head: the right to counsel versus the right to serve as one's
 
10
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
own counsel. The United States Supreme Court has recently
 
observed:
 
It is beyond dispute that "[t]he Sixth Amendment safeguards
to an accused who faces incarceration the right to counsel
at all critical stages of the criminal process."  It is just
as well settled, however, that a defendant also has the
right to "proceed without counsel when he voluntarily and
intelligently elects to do so."  There can be some tension
 in these two principles. 
Marshall, 133 S.Ct. at 1449 (citations omitted). In this case,
 
the circuit court erred in refusing to appoint substitute counsel
 for Pitts for post-verdict motions. In order to prevent similar
 future deprivations, we hold that the post-trial motion stage is
 a critical stage of the prosecution during which the right to
 counsel attaches, notwithstanding a defendant's earlier mid-trial
 waiver of the right to counsel. 
In this appeal, the circuit court insisted upon enforcing
 
Pitts' right to self-representation, even though it had become
 apparent at the post-verdict and sentencing stages of the
 prosecution that Pitts no longer desired to proceed pro se and
 had reasserted his right to counsel. A defendant's exercise of
 the right to self-representation, however, is not irreversible;
 the right is subject to termination. See State v. Hutch, 75 Haw.
 
307, 320, 861 P.2d 11, 21 (1993)(citing Faretta, 422 U.S. at 835
 n.46 (observing that the right to self-representation is not
 offended when counsel is made "available to represent the
 [defendant] in the event that termination of the defendant's
 
11
    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
self-representation is necessary.'")(emphasis added). In
 
McKaskle v. Wiggins, 465 U.S. 168, 182 (1984), the United States
 Supreme Court held that the right to self-representation
 terminates when a self-represented defendant either expressly
 approves of, or impliedly invites through acquiescence, counsel's
 participation in his defense. 
In this case, Pitts expressly requested counsel for his
 
post-verdict motions, again demonstrating his intention to
 terminate self-representation. See McKaskle, 465 U.S. at 182. 
Therefore, under McKaskle and Hutch, the circuit court would not
 have violated Pitts' right to self-representation had he
 appointed counsel for Pitts for post-verdict motions and
 sentencing. Hence, the circuit court erred in insisting that
 Pitts' earlier mid-trial waiver of counsel carried through post-
verdict. 
The State argues that Pitts' requests for appointment of
 
counsel post-verdict were "untimely" because they were raised on
 May 12, 2010, upon the hearing of those post-verdict motions.
 Pitts does not dispute that he requested post-verdict counsel on
 May 12, 2010. It is unlikely, however, that Pitts could have
 requested counsel any earlier than he did. At the April 7, 2010
 hearing on Schum's motion, the circuit court had orally ruled
 
12
     
 
 5 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
that Schum "lacked standing" to act as Pitts' standby counsel and
 
that Pitts was pro se after the verdict.5
 
The consequence of the circuit court's ruling that Schum's
 
role as standby counsel ended at the close of trial was that
 Pitts then had to file his pro se post-verdict motions as soon as
 possible, because sentencing was set for May 12, 2010, a month
 away. At the May 12, 2010 hearing, it became apparent to Pitts
 that the circuit court was about to deny his motions and that he
 was ill equipped to handle his own representation at that point. 
Therefore, Pitts requested post-verdict counsel then, which the
 circuit court refused because Pitts had waived counsel during
 trial. 
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has
 
addressed a question similar to the one at bar: "[I]s a
 criminal defendant entitled to the assistance of an attorney at a
 post-trial hearing when prior to trial he waived the right to
 
On this score, Hawai �i Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 802-5 (1993), which 
governs indigent defendants, states, in relevant part, "When it shall appear
to a judge that a person requesting the appointment of counsel satisfies therequirements of this chapter, the judge shall appoint counsel to represent theperson at all stages of the proceedings, including appeal, if any."  (Emphasis added).  The circuit court, in appointing Schum (then assigning him as standbycounsel), appointed him for "all stages of the proceedings" and did notexclude post-trial motions as part of Schum's role.  If that was the circuit court's intent, that should have been communicated to Pitts and Schum whenSchum was assigned as standby counsel.  See, e.g., People v. Lindsey, 308
N.E.2d 111, 117 (Ill.App.3d 1974)("We are of the opinion that it wasprejudicial to tell the defendant he could represent himself, with a court-designated lawyer to assist him, and then, at crucial phases of his trial,when he made reasonable requests for assistance, prevent the lawyer fromassisting him."). 
13
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
counsel and chose to represent himself?" Menefield v. Borg, 881
 
F.2d 696, 698 (9th Cir. 1989). The Ninth Circuit answered the
 
question in the affirmative, holding that the motion for a new
 trial is a "critical stage" in the prosecution, at which the
 right to counsel attaches. 881 F.2d at 699. The Ninth Circuit
 continued, "[A]lthough we recognize the right to counsel –- once
 waived –- is no longer absolute, we start with the strong
 presumption that a defendant's post-trial request for the
 assistance of an attorney should not be refused." 881 F.2d at
 700. 
The Menefield court also held that "at least in the absence
 
of extraordinary circumstances, an accused who requests an
 attorney at the time of a motion for a new trial is entitled to
 have one appointed, unless the government can show that the
 request is made for a bad faith purpose." 881 F.2d at 701. The
 Ninth Circuit rejected as insufficient the government's argument
 that the defendant's "pretrial dismissal of two attorneys proves
 his bad faith." Id. It reasoned, "While repeated firings of
 
counsel may in some circumstances evidence an improper motive,
 pretrial dismissals should ordinarily have little influence on
 the determination of whether a post-conviction motion for
 appointment of counsel is improper." Id. This was because "the
 
unsettling experience of trial, as well as its unsatisfactory
 
14
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
result, will be the source of a defendant's discontent with his
 
own services and, consequently, the basis for his post-trial
 motion for the assistance of counsel." Id. 
We agree that, in the absence of extraordinary
 
circumstances, a defendant who has exercised the right to self-
representation at trial, but expressly requests counsel for post-
verdict motions or for sentencing has a right to counsel. The
 State argues that Pitts' track record of firing four court-
appointed attorneys pre-trial was a circumstance to be considered
 in denying the appointment of counsel for post-verdict motions
 (and sentencing). However, Pitts requested counsel post-verdict
 due to his "discontent with his own services" with regard to the
 post-verdict motions. Thus, under the circumstances of this
 case, Pitts' pre-trial track record of firing counsel is
 insufficient to establish that his post-verdict request for
 counsel was made in bad faith. There is also no other evidence
 of bad faith on Pitts' part in his request for counsel.
 
The United States Supreme Court has not considered whether a
 
criminal defendant has a Sixth Amendment right to counsel for
 post-verdict motions. See Marshall, 133 S.Ct. at 1451. 
Nevertheless, "[w]e have long recognized . . . that 'as the
 ultimate judicial tribunal with final, unreviewable authority to
 
interpret and enforce the Hawai� i Constitution, we are free to 
15
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
give broader protection under the Hawai� i Constitution than that 
given by the federal constitution." State v. Viglielmo, 105 
Hawai�i 197, 210-11, 95 P.3d 952, 965-66 (2004)(citations 
omitted). Therefore, we hold that, under Article I, Section 14 
of the Hawai� i Constitution, a defendant who expressly requests 
counsel for post-verdict motions has a right to counsel, 
notwithstanding a prior waiver of counsel during trial. 
C. The Right to Counsel for Sentencing
 
The circuit court also erred in failing to appoint
 
substitute counsel for sentencing. The circuit court granted
 Pitts' motion for appointment of counsel for his appeal, but
 denied Pitts' motion for appointment of counsel for sentencing,
 reasoning as follows: "[T]here's only one sentence that I can
 give you, legally. . . . I don't think an attorney would do you
 much good at this sentencing anyway because I don't have any
 discretion whatsoever."
 
It is well settled that the sentencing phase is a critical
 
stage of the prosecution, during which the right to counsel
 attaches. State v. Valera, 74 Haw. 424, 435, 848 P.2d 376, 381
 
(1993). The ICA quoted the rationale for this in D'Ambrosio as
 follows: "[C]ounsel might not have changed the sentence, but he
 could have taken steps to see that the conviction and sentence
 were not predicated on misinformation or misreading of court
 
16
  
     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
records, a requirement of fair play which absence of counsel
 
withheld from this prisoner." 112 Hawai� i at 463, 146 P.3d at 
623 (citing Townsend v. Burke, 334 U.S. 736, 741 (1948)). The
 
sentencing hearing presented an important opportunity for the
 defendant to be heard and to correct any misinformation or
 misreading of court records:
 
Opportunity to be heard with respect to sentence; notice of
pre-sentence report; opportunity to controvert or
supplement; transmission of report to department.  (1)
Before imposing sentence, the court shall afford a fair
opportunity to the defendant to be heard on the issue of the
defendant's disposition.
(2) The court shall furnish to the defendant or the
 
defendant's counsel and to the prosecuting attorney a copy
of the report of any pre-sentence diagnosis or
psychological, psychiatric, or other medical examination and
afford fair opportunity, if the defendant or the prosecuting
attorney so requests, to controvert or supplement them.  The
 court shall amend or order the amendment of the report upon
finding that any correction, modification, or addition is
needed and, where appropriate, shall require the prompt
preparation of an amended report in which material required
to be deleted is completely removed or other amendments,
including additions, are made. . . .   
HRS § 706-604 (1993 & Supp. 2006). Substitute counsel could have
 
provided valuable assistance to Pitts in "controvert[ing] or
 supplement[ing]" a presentence diagnosis report. 
Further, even if there were no other sentence available to
 
Pitts but a life term of imprisonment with the possibility of
 parole, Pitts would have benefited by having substitute counsel
 guiding him through the exercise (or non-exercise) of his right
 to allocution, preserving his arguments for appeal, and preparing
 
for the proceedings before the Hawai� i Paroling Authority. To 
17
 ________________________________________________________________ *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the extent that Pitts' ability to defend his interests on a level
 
playing field was substantially affected by the denial of
 substitute counsel for sentencing, the circuit court's decision
 to force Pitts to proceed pro se during sentencing was error. 
Pitts' right to counsel, as enshrined in Article I, Section 14 of
 
the Hawai� i Constitution, was violated when the circuit court 
denied his motion for appointment of counsel for sentencing. 
V. Conclusion
 
We hold that the circuit court erred by not appointing
 
substitute counsel for Pitts' post-verdict motions because post-
verdict proceedings are critical stages in the prosecution. The
 circuit court also erred by not appointing substitute counsel for
 Pitts' sentencing. We therefore vacate the ICA's judgment on
 
appeal and remand this case for further proceedings. __________

The remand we order in this case remedies the constitutional violation. 
As we observed in note 3, infra, ordinarily the deadline for a motion for new
trial cannot be extended under HRPP Rule 45(b).  The remand we order seeks
 only to place Pitts in the position he would have been in had the
constitutional violation never occurred.  Cf. Rodgers, 678 F.3d at 1164
("Regarding the right to counsel, we previously held that a habeas remedy
should put the defendant back in the position he would have been in if the
