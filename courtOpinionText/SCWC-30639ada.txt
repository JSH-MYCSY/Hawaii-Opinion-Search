 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY NAKAYAMA, J.
 
When a trial judge makes an unequivocal ruling that
 
evidence is admissible at trial, the party that had sought to
 
exclude such evidence by means of a motion in limine need not
 renew its objection when that evidence is introduced at trial in
 order to preserve the objection for appellate review.
 
In this case, Respondents/Plaintiffs-Appellants Lisa
 
Kobashigawa and Margaret M. Kobashigawa (collectively, the
 Kobashigawas) brought a negligence action against Defendant
 Joseph M.K. Silva and Petitioner/Defendant-Appellee City and
 County of Honolulu (the City) for damages arising from a tragic
 incident in which William S. Kobashigawa was struck and killed
 while crossing a mid-block crosswalk shortly before sunrise
 during his morning walk. Although the Kobashigawas settled their
 claims against Silva, they proceeded to trial against the City;
 the jury found the City not liable. On appeal, the Intermediate
 Court of Appeals (ICA) vacated the jury verdict and remanded for
 a new trial, concluding that the circuit court plainly erred in
 giving a cautionary jury instruction that permitted the jury to
 consider evidence of the Kobashigawas’ motive in filing suit and
 in allowing the City to comment on such motive in its closing
 argument.
 
In its application to this court, the City focuses on
 
2
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the cautionary jury instruction, as the ICA did, and argues to
 
this court that the ICA gravely erred in concluding that (1) the
 instruction was an erroneous statement of the law and (2) the
 circuit court’s issuance of the instruction satisfied the test
 for plain error review. In their response to the application,
 the Kobashigawas maintain that the instruction was an erroneous
 statement of law because a plaintiff’s motive in bringing an
 otherwise valid lawsuit is generally irrelevant to resolution of
 the merits of the lawsuit. The Kobashigawas also argue that the
 ICA’s application of plain error review did not constitute grave
 error, although they reiterate the argument made to the ICA that
 they were not required to make additional objections subsequent
 to the hearing on their pretrial motions in limine in order to
 preserve their claimed errors for appeal. 
Although we agree with the ICA’s ultimate conclusion
 
that the circuit court’s cautionary jury instruction regarding
 motive was a prejudicially erroneous statement of the law, we
 disagree with its conclusions that the Kobashigawas failed to
 preserve their objections to the admission of irrelevant evidence
 concerning their motive in filing suit and that such failure
 required it to resort to plain error review. Accordingly, as
 modified by this opinion, we affirm the ICA’s judgment vacating
 the circuit court’s judgment and remanding the case for a new

trial.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
A. Factual Background and Pre-Trial Proceedings
 
On December 22, 2005, shortly before sunrise at 
approximately 5:45 a.m., William was in the act of crossing a 
marked mid-block pedestrian crosswalk on Kamehameha Highway in Kâne'ohe when he was struck and killed by a truck driven by 
Silva. Kobashigawa v. Silva, 126 Hawai' i 62, 64, 266 P.3d 470, 
472 (App. 2011). 
2
On April 21, 2006, Lisa, William’s daughter,  and
Margaret, William’s wife, filed a complaint against Silva in the
 
3
Circuit Court of the First Circuit  alleging negligence and
negligent infliction of emotional distress and seeking special and general damages. On March 5, 2007, the Kobashigawas filed a First Amended Complaint adding the City as a defendant. The Kobashigawas’ negligence claim against the City “included defective design and/or maintenance of Kamehameha Highway, including the pedestrian crosswalk and the surrounding trees, street signs and/or street lights at or near the crosswalk.” 
Kobashigawa
, 126 Hawai' i at 64, 266 P.3d at 472. On March 22, 
2
 Lisa initially filed suit both in her individual capacity and in
 
her capacity as Personal Representative of William S. Kobashigawa’s Estate,
but later stipulated to dismissal with prejudice of all claims filed as a
plaintiff in her individual capacity.

 The Honorable Rom A. Trader presided.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
2007, Silva then filed a cross-claim against the City, alleging
 
that it was solely responsible for William’s death. On March 18,
 2008, the Kobashigawas filed the operative Second Amended
 Complaint against Silva and the City, realleging negligence and
 negligent infliction of emotional distress and adding a claim of
 loss of consortium and services as to Margaret only. 
Gina Bailey was the only eyewitness to the accident,
 
and she was deposed by the City on June 14, 2009. In addition to
 her recollection of what happened at the scene of the accident,
 she testified in pertinent part as follows:
 
Q After the date of the accident, did you talk to
anybody from the pedestrian’s family?
A Yes.  That day, the police called me.  He said that
 
the family would like to speak to me, and they gave me the
daughter’s phone number.  And I called her, thinking maybe
she wanted to know about how her father died, if he said any
last words, if he was suffering, anything like that, and I
told her who I was, and the first thing out of her mouth
was, “Would you be willing to testify if we sued?”
Q Any other thing in that conversation?
 
A No. I pretty much hung up, after that.  I was so mad. 
4
She saw her father’s death with money signs in her eyes.[ ]
Q And after that -- do you recall the daughter’s name?
 
A I don
’t.
 
Q After that conversation, did you have any other
conversations with this daughter or any member of his
family?
A I did not.
 
Q And you knew this was the daughter because she
identified herself when you called?
A The police told me that this was the phone number of
the pedestrian’s daughter.
 
Bailey also stated that she remembered making the call one day
 
after the accident. Because Bailey no longer lived in Hawai' i, 
4
 This sentence was barred from admission as calling for speculation
 
pursuant to the court’s partial grant of the Kobashigawas’ Motion in Limine
No. 4, discussed infra.
 
5
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
had moved to California, and was in the United States Navy and
 
expected to be deployed overseas shortly thereafter, she would be
 unable to appear at trial; subsequently, the City designated
 Bailey’s entire deposition transcript for use at trial, and Silva
 designated portions of the transcript.
 
On September 21, 2009, the Kobashigawas filed their
 
Motion in Limine No. 1 seeking an order barring evidence and
 argument “by [the d]efendants speculating on [the Kobashigawas’]
 motives for pursuing the instant action, including, but not
 limited to, that [the Kobashigawas] have pursued claims against
 [the d]efendants for pecuniary reasons, i.e., [in] order to
 recover monetary damages against wealthy or ‘deep pocket’
 defendants in the case.” The Kobashigawas also filed their
 Motion in Limine No. 4 objecting to admission of certain parts of
 Bailey’s deposition testimony. At a hearing on the motions on
 October 5, 2009, the circuit court denied Motion in Limine No. 1
 and indicated its intent to give a cautionary instruction to the
 jury that such evidence could only be considered in determining
 bias, interest, or motive on the part of the Kobashigawas in
 filing suit:
 
THE COURT: [. . .] With that, the [c]ourt will confirm its
ruling, will deny the motion, does intend to issue a
cautionary, which I will provide the parties with copies of
what the [c]ourt has sort of drafted and then we can sort of
visit this sufficiency or propriety of the way those are
drafted at a later point.  But basically, the [c]ourt does
intend to sort of limit its consideration, any bias,
 
6
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
interest or motive, if any is shown.
All right.  So with that, that dispenses of
plain
tiff’s number one.
 
With respect to Motion in Limine No. 4, the court granted the
 
motion in part as to certain of Bailey’s statements that called
 for speculation and denied the remainder of the motion. 
B. Relevant Trial Proceedings
 
Jury trial began on October 8, 2009. Meanwhile, the
 
Kobashigawas reached a settlement with Silva; on October 9, 2009,
 
the circuit court granted his petition for determination of good
 faith settlement filed on September 22, 2009 and dismissed all
 claims against him with prejudice. Thus, trial proceeded with
 the Kobashigawas as plaintiffs and the City as the sole remaining
 defendant. At trial, after Bailey’s deposition testimony was
 read into evidence during the Kobashigawas’ case-in-chief, the
 court read its cautionary instruction to the jury:
 
You have heard testimony from one witness about certain
statements attributed to a Kobashigawa family member
following Mr. Kobashigawa’s death.  Your consideration of
 this evidence is limited to determining the existence or
absence of any possible bias, interest or motive, if any, by
plaintiffs in bringing this lawsuit and not for any other
purpose.  Specifically, you may not consider this evidence
of negative character or negative conduct by plaintiffs or
for any other purpose.
 
Later in the Kobashigawas’ case-in-chief, Gail Pei, William’s
 
daughter and Lisa’s sister, testified and disputed Bailey’s
 allegations as to what was said during the phone call:
 
Q All right.  Now, there also has been a deposition read
from a Gina Bailey -­
A Uh-huh.
 
7
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Q -- who said she called the house the day after she was
given a number by the police to call the house to speak to a
daughter.
A Uh-hu
 h.
 
Q Did you speak to her?
 
A The day after? No, no, not at all.
 
Q Do you know if any of your sisters spoke to her?
 
A No one even mentioned her name, no.
 
Q Okay.  The day after your father’s death, that would
have been December 23, 2005.  Who was at the house?
 A All of us were at my parents’ house, but we were just
so busy because the telephone was ringing off the hook.  It
 was from the media and some -- I don’t know -- some
 insurance person tried calling my mother.  And it was crazy.
 Q Okay.  And so -- but in all of those phone calls, you
do not -- and no one mentioned that a witness was calling?
A No.
 
Q Did you have a conversation with somebody named Gina?
 
A I did.
 
Q And when did that occur?
 
A That had to have occurred -- it was -- I had already
gone back to work, so it was after the funeral.  I’m not
 sure if it was January 5th.  I know I was back at work
 because when the phone call came in, I was walking -- it was
after work, after 4:30, and I was walking to my car, which I
parked at Ala Moana Shopping Center.
Q Did the person identify herself?
 
A Yes, she did.
 
Q And what did she say?
 
A She identified herself and she said that she got my
number from the -- I guess one of the police investigators,
that I would be interested in speaking with her.  So I took
 her phone call and the only thing I remember asking about
her was -- of course we want to know if my dad had any last
words.  But Gina went on to say that when she had gotten out
of her car to go to him to see if she could render CPR, he
was already passed.
Q Okay.  And did you ask her if she wanted -- would be a
 
witness?
 A No, I didn’t.
 
Q Was there any talk like that?
 
A No.
 
Gail further stated on cross-examination by the City:
 
Q You mentioned that you didn’t speak to a person the
day a
fter this tragedy; is that correct?  You didn’t speak
to a person by the name of Gina Bailey on the phone that
day?
A No. On that day things were pretty chaotic because we
had a funeral to plan.
Q Certainly.  I understand that.  Did you speak to her
 
though at any time?  A person that you knew to be Gina
 Bailey?
A That was after I had already gone back to work.
 
Q Uh-huh.
 
8
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
A So it had to be about January 5th or somewhere around
that area or that time because I know I had gone back to
work because it was after work when I got that call on my
cell phone.
Q Had you given t
 he police your cell phone number to be
contacted?
 A Yes.
 
Q So had you asked the police to have the witness call
 
you?
A Yes.
 
Q And it was to your -- to the best you remember, it was
after the new year, 2006?
A It had to be.
 
Q Okay.  And then you spoke to the woman on the phone?
 
A Yes.
 
Q About how long did you speak to her?
 
A Maybe about a minute or two.
 
Q Yeah.  And -- and there was no -- there was no mention
 
about asking her to be a witness -­A No.
 
Q -- to testify in any lawsuit?
 
A No.
 
Q It was jus
t a brief one-minute conversation?
 
A Right.
 
Q Did it end on -- on cordial terms, that telephone
 
call?
 A Yes, it did, because I only had one question for her,
and that was, you know, if my dad had any last words.
Q And she told you obviously -­
A Yes.
 
Q -- that -- no.  Okay.
 
At the close of trial, the court’s cautionary instruction
 
regarding bias, interest, or motive was included in the packet of
 jury instructions and was read to the jury again in full as part
 of the instructions before closing arguments. During the City’s
 closing argument, it pointed to the Kobashigawas’ possible
 monetary motivation to file a lawsuit:
 
And that brings us to Gina Bailey.  Gina Bailey.  We
 
had her deposition testimony.  You’ve heard she’s in the
 
Navy.  She is the only person -- the only eyewitness who
does not have a stake in this case.  She has no interest in
 the case.  And if plaintiffs attempt to gloss over Ms.
Bailey’s eyewitness account of this really horrible
accident, why would they do this?  Well, there’s one aspect.
She told you in a day or so after the accident she got a
call from Officer Lisa Reed to call one of the family
 
9
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
members to talk about the accident.  Ms. Bailey made that
call, and the first words that Ms. Bailey told you that she
heard was will you testify when we sue?  Ms. Bailey
obviously was appalled, recoiled and hung up the telephone
just as her deposition testimony told you.  Why hang up? 
It’s obvious, she recoiled from the notion of looking to
file a lawsuit within a day or so after this accident, not
asking her about did my father suffer, did my father have
any last words, what can you tell me, was he at peace,
nothing like that?
Now, Ms. Pei says it was her who talked to Ms. Bailey
and s
he said they had a nice conversation, a nice
conversation about her father’s last moments, totally in
contradiction to Ms. Bailey’s testimony.  A nice
 conversation on the telephone about her father’s last
moments that lasted about one minute.  Does that make any
sense to you or does Ms. Bailey’s testimony make more sense
to you?
 
Before concluding, the City’s counsel referred to the
 
Kobashigawas’ monetary motive one additional time:
 
And there’s some other minor points that I want you to
consider about damages, and it comes with a question.  Why
is the City in this lawsuit?  To collect monetary damages,
but from whom do they seek this compensation?  Well, of
 course, it’s from the City.  With this in mind, with those
facts in mind, consider, this, Dr. Hayes [ 
5
] was hired to go
to the scene to investigate it six days after the accident. 
Couns
el was certainly hired earlier than six days after the
accident to take him out there looks like.  And Gina Bailey
says that she spoke to a family member within a day or so
after the accident who wanted her to testify in their
lawsuit.  Is this case simply about getting a collectable
monetary award from the City when it was Mr. Silva who
caused the accident?
 
On October 21, 2009, the jury then returned a verdict in favor of
 
the City, indicating on the special verdict form that it did not
 find the City negligent.

 Dr. Charles Hayes testified as an expert witness for the
 
Kobashigawas, having been qualified by the court as an expert in the field of
physics with expertise in the area of lighting.

 Margaret died on February 26, 2010, between the end of trial and
 
the entry of judgment; consequently, Earl Kobashigawa, William’s son and
Lisa’s brother, and Gail were substituted as plaintiffs in their capacity as
co-tr
ustees of the Margaret M. Kobashigawa Revocable Living Trust and as
(continued...)
 
10
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The circuit court entered its Judgment Pursuant to
 
Special Verdict on March 25, 2010. After disposition of the
 
City’s motion for taxation of costs and a stipulation to dismiss
 all remaining claims, the Kobashigawas timely filed a Notice of
 Appeal on July 28, 2010. 
C. The ICA’s December 2, 2011 Published Opinion
 
On appeal to the ICA, the Kobashigawas raised several
 
points of error that were all related to the issue of Bailey’s
 
motive evidence and the circuit court’s cautionary instruction to
 the jury on bias, interest, or motive.
7 Specifically, the
 
Kobashigawas argued that the circuit court erred in: (1) denying
 Motion in Limine No. 1 and denying in part Motion in Limine No.
 4, because the City could then introduce evidence related to the
 
8
Kobashigawas’ motive for filing suit;  (2) allowing the parts of
Bailey’s deposition testimony referring to the Kobashigawas’
 motive, because such evidence was irrelevant and prejudicial; (3)
 giving the cautionary instruction because this served to place
 
6(...continued)
Margaret’s assignees.  
7
 The Kobashigawas also argued that the circuit court erroneously
 
awarded costs to the City because that award was based on the erroneous
verdict.  The issue of costs is not before this court.
 
8
 Although the Kobashigawas preserved their objections to the 
introduction of such evidence and raised this point on appeal, the ICA did notaddress the point in its analysis.  It instead proceeded directly to the errorin the circuit court’s cautionary jury instruction.  See Kobashigawa, 126 Hawai'i at 65, 266 P.3d at 473. 
11
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
prejudicial emphasis on the Kobashigawas’ alleged motive rather
 
than cure any prejudice created by the evidence; and (4) allowing
 the City to comment on the Kobashigawas’ supposed motive in its
 closing argument to the jury. 
The City argued in response that the circuit court: (1)
 
did not err in denying the motions in limine because those
 rulings are preliminary and cannot be deemed reversible error,
 and because Bailey’s deposition testimony was relevant and
 admissible; (2) did not err in allowing Bailey’s deposition
 testimony to be introduced because it was relevant, the court had
 already struck prejudicial portions of the testimony, and because
 the Kobashigawas introduced it themselves in their case-in-chief;
 (3) did not err in giving the cautionary jury instruction because
 the Kobashigawas did not object to the instruction and failed to
 propose a different instruction or alternate wording for the
 instruction, and because the jury instructions as a whole were
 not misleading or erroneous statements of the law; and (4) did
 not err in allowing the City to comment on motive in its closing
 argument because the Kobashigawas did not object and because the
 closing argument was based on reasonable inferences from the
 evidence presented during the trial. 
In its opinion, the ICA agreed with the Kobashigawas
 
that the circuit court erred in issuing the cautionary
 
12
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
instruction to the jury because it was “an erroneous statement of 
the law.” Kobashigawa, 126 Hawai' i at 65, 266 P.3d at 473. 
Although the ICA noted the City’s argument that the “Kobashigawas did not object to this jury instruction at trial[,]” id., it 
also stated that “even the complete failure to object to a jury instruction does not prevent an appellate court from taking cognizance of the trial court’s error if the error is plain and may result in a miscarriage of justice.” Id. (quoting Montalvo 
v. Lapez, 77 Hawai' i 282, 288, 884 P.2d 345, 351 (1994)) 
(internal quotation marks omitted). 
The ICA thus stated that three factors must be 
considered in determining whether a trial court has committed plain error in a civil case: “(1) whether consideration of the issue not raised at trial requires additional facts; (2) whether its resolution will affect the integrity of the trial court’s findings of fact; and (3) whether the issue is of great public import.” Id. (quoting Montalvo, 77 Hawai' i at 290, 884 P.2d at 
353). 
The ICA concluded that all three factors were met, and
 
in proceeding to the point of error, held that the instruction
 misstated the law because “[i]n bringing an action, the motives
 of the plaintiffs are immaterial absent bad faith.” Id. The ICA
 
further held that in light of the improper jury instruction, the
 
13
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
circuit court also erred in allowing the City to comment on the
 
Kobashigawas’ motive for bringing suit during its closing
 argument. Id. at 66-67, 266 P.3d at 474-75. The ICA thus
 
vacated the circuit court’s March 25, 2010 Judgment Pursuant to
 Special Verdict and remanded the case for a new trial. Id. at
 
67, 266 P.3d at 475.
 
The City timely filed its application on March 21,
 
2012. The Kobashigawas timely filed a response to the
 application on April 5, 2012.
 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
A. Motion in Limine
 
The granting or denying of a motion in limine is reviewed
for abuse of discretion.  The denial of a motion in limine,
in itself, is not reversible error.  The harm, if any,
occurs when the evidence is improperly admitted at trial. 
Thus, even if the trial court abused its discretion in
denying a party’s motion, the real test is not in the
disposition of the motion but the admission of evidence at
trial.
 
State v. Eid, 126 Hawai' i 430, 440, 272 P.3d 1197, 1207 (2012) 
(quoting Miyamoto v. Lum, 104 Hawai' i 1, 7, 84 P.3d 509, 515 
(2004) (internal quotation marks, citations, and ellipsis
 
omitted)). Furthermore, as we have often stated, “[a]n abuse of
 discretion occurs where the trial court has clearly exceeded the
 bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles of law or
 practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant.” Hart
 
v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., 126 Hawai' i 448, 455, 272 P.3d 1215, 
14
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
1222 (2012) (quoting Allstate Ins. Co. v. Pruett, 118 Hawai' i 
174, 179, 186 P.3d 609, 614 (2008)) (brackets in original). 
B. Jury Instructions
 
When jury instructions, or the omission thereof, are at
issue on appeal, the standard of review is whether, when
read and considered as a whole, the instructions given are
prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, or
misleading.  Erroneous instructions are presumptively
harmful and are a ground for reversal unless it
affirmatively appears from the record as a whole that the
error was not prejudicial.
 
Nelson v. Univ. of Haw., 97 Hawai' i 376, 386, 38 P.3d 95, 105 
(2001) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
 
III. DISCUSSION
 
This case prompts us to examine when and how an
 
objection to evidence admitted in a trial may be made and
 
preserved for appellate review. In its opinion, the ICA
 correctly concluded that the circuit court erred in giving its
 cautionary jury instruction regarding the Kobashigawas’ motive in
 filing suit. However, it conducted its analysis using plain
 error review premised on the fact that, during trial, the
 Kobashigawas did not make contemporaneous objections to the
 giving of the instruction or to references to motive in the
 City’s closing argument. Thus, the ICA did not explicitly
 address the points raised by the Kobashigawas alleging error in
 the denial of their Motions in Limine No. 1 and No. 4, which in
 turn allowed the introduction of inadmissible evidence--mainly
 
15
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
from Gina Bailey’s deposition testimony--related to the
 
Kobashigawas’ motives for filing a lawsuit and naming the City as
 a defendant. The ICA also arrived at its result without
 considering whether the Kobashigawas had properly preserved their
 objections by moving in limine to exclude all evidence and
 argument concerning motive.
 
Case law dating back to 1983 in this state and even 
earlier in others establishes that when a court makes a definitive pretrial ruling on the admissibility of evidence, the party that had unsuccessfully moved to exclude the evidence need not repeat essentially the same objection during trial in order to preserve a claim of error on appeal. Furthermore, although originating in case law, the so-called “definitive ruling” or “unequivocal ruling” exception has been made part of the rules of evidence both at the federal level as well as in a number of states. Although the Hawai' i Rules of Evidence (HRE) has 
contained the exception since the enactment of an amendment to Rule 103 in 2006, the ICA did not address the exception even though the Kobashigawas specifically referenced it in their argument that the circuit court had erred in allowing evidence and argument on motive during trial. 
In affirming the ICA’s judgment, we thus take this
 
opportunity to clarify that when the trial court makes a
 
16
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
definitive pretrial ruling that evidence is admissible, the party
 
opposing that ruling need not renew its objection during trial in
 order to preserve its claim on appeal that the evidence was
 erroneously admitted. We further clarify that subsequent
 introduction of the evidence by the party opposing the ruling
 also does not waive that party’s claim of error on appeal.
 
A. Development of the Law of Motions in Limine in Hawai' i 
“A motion in limine is a procedural device which 
requests a pretrial order enjoining opposing counsel from using 
certain prejudicial evidence in front of a jury at a later trial.”

(2002) (Acoba, J., concurring) (quoting State v. Miura, 6 Haw. App. 501, 504, 730 P.2d 917, 920 (1986)) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also, e.g., 75 Am. Jur. 2d Trial § 39 (2007) (“The purpose of a motion in limine is to prevent irrelevant, inadmissible, or prejudicial matters from being admitted in evidence or to exclude evidence when its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.” (footnotes omitted)); Johnny K. Richardson, Use of Motions in Limine in Civil Proceedings, 45 Mo. L. Rev. 130, 134 (1980) (“The

 In addition to excluding evidence the opposing party seeks to
 
introduce, a party may also seek an in limine ruling in advance of trial
confirming that its own evidence is admissible.  See, e.g., 21 Charles Alan
Wright & Kenneth W. Graham, Jr., Federal Practice and Procedure: Evidence §
5037.10, at 758 & n.6 (2d ed. 2005).

prohibitive motion in limine requests the court to issue an order
 
prohibiting opposing counsel and his witnesses from alluding to
 the prejudicial evidence in any manner during any portion of the
 trial proceedings.”).
 
In an earlier case often cited in this jurisdiction for
 
its discussion on motions in limine, the ICA stated:
 
In essence, a motion in limine is generally made before or
at the beginning of a jury trial for a protective order
against prejudicial questions, statements, and evidence.  It
 serves the useful purpose of raising and pointing out before
trial certain evidentiary rulings the court may be called
upon to make during the course of trial.
 
Lussier v. Mau-Van Dev., Inc., 4 Haw. App. 359, 393, 667 P.2d
 
804, 826 (1983) (citing Twyford v. Weber, 220 N.W.2d 919 (Iowa
 1974); Akins v. State, 429 N.E.2d 232 (Ind. 1981); Lagenour v.
 State, 376 N.E.2d 475 (Ind. 1978); Tom H. Davis, Motions in
 Limine, 15 Clev.-Marshall L. Rev. 255 (1966)). Even earlier, in
 an opinion issued when the motion in limine was still gaining
 acceptance as a standard pretrial procedure, the Texas Supreme
 Court noted:
 
The purpose in filing a motion in limine to suppress
evidence or to instruct opposing counsel not to offer it is
to prevent the asking of prejudicial questions and the
making of prejudicial statements in the presence of the jury
with respect to matters which have no proper bearing on the
issues in the case or on the rights of the parties to the
suit.
 
Bridges v. City of Richardson, 354 S.W.2d 366, 367 (Tex. 1962)
 
(emphasis added).
 
As with other evidentiary rulings, “[t]he granting or
 
18
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
denying of a motion in limine is within the trial court’s
 
inherent power to exclude and admit evidence.” Lussier, 4 Haw.
 
App. at 392, 667 P.2d at 826 (citing Jean C. Love, Note, Pretrial
 Exclusionary Evidence Rulings, 1967 Wis. L. Rev. 738); see also
 Burrus v. Silhavy, 293 N.E.2d 794, 798 (Ind. App. 1973) (“The
 trial court’s authority to entertain ‘motions in limine’ emanates
 from its inherent power to admit and exclude evidence. This
 inherent power to exclude extends to prejudicial questions and
 statements that could be made in the presence of a jury and
 thereby interfere with fair and impartial administration of
 justice.”). Because a denial of a pretrial motion in limine to
 exclude evidence is generally regarded as an interlocutory order
 subject to reconsideration when the evidence is actually offered
 during trial, such “denial of a motion in limine [to exclude], in
 itself, is not reversible error. The harm, if any, occurs when
 the evidence is improperly admitted at trial.” Lussier, 4 Haw.
 
App. at 393, 667 P.2d at 826 (citing Akins, 429 N.E.2d 232;
 Dayton Walther Corp. v. Caldwell, 389 N.E.2d 723 (Ind. App.
 1979); State v. Church of Nazarene of Logansport, 377 N.E.2d 607
 (Ind. 1978)). Therefore, consonant with the principle that
 preservation of error is a necessary prerequisite for review of
 that error on appeal, when a motion in limine to exclude evidence
 is simply denied without a ruling on admissibility and the
 
19
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
evidence is subsequently introduced by the opposing party during
 
trial, “a proper objection at that time is necessary to preserve
 the error for appellate review.” Id. (citing Love, supra;
 
Lagenour, 376 N.E.2d 475; Church of Nazarene of Logansport, 377
 N.E.2d 607; Twyford, 220 N.W.2d 919; United States v. Traylor,
 656 F.2d 1326, 1333 n.6 (9th Cir. 1981); Collins v. Wayne Corp.,
 621 F.2d 777 (5th Cir. 1980); Hartford Accident & Indem. Co. v.
 McCardell, 369 S.W.2d 331 (Tex. 1963)). Thus, as is generally
 true for appellate review of any issue, the failure to object to
 evidence introduced after denial of a pretrial motion in limine
 to exclude that same evidence will result in waiver of the
 objection on appeal. See id. (citing Rojas v. Richardson, 703
 
F.2d 186 (5th Cir. 1983)).
 
Nevertheless, even at the time Lussier was decided,
 
there was an exception to the general rule: “objections need not
 be renewed if the prior ruling on the motion in limine amounted
 to an unequivocal holding concerning the issue raised.” Id.
 
(citing State v. Miller, 229 N.W.2d 762 (Iowa 1975)). “Where a
 hearing was held, counsel presented legal arguments, and the
 trial court ruled whether or not the challenged evidence would be
 admitted at trial, there is no necessity of further objection to
 preserve such error for appeal.” Id. at 393-94, 667 P.2d at 826
 
(citing State v. Harlow, 325 N.W.2d 90 (Iowa 1982)) (emphasis
 
20
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
added). With these principles in mind, the Lussier court
 
ultimately held that because the trial court simply denied the
 motion in limine without ruling on the admissibility of the
 evidence at that time, an objection was necessary at trial to
 preserve the error for appeal; because Lussier did not enter any
 objections on the record, he waived his challenge to the
 introduction of evidence concerning his motives in filing suit. 
Id. at 394, 667 P.2d at 826-27.
 
Subsequently, the law of motions in limine in Hawai' i 
was not revisited until 1995. In Craft v. Peebles, Teena Craft brought a medical malpractice action against Lawrence Peebles, M.D. and a products liability action against McGhan Medical Corporation for manufacturing allegedly defective breast implants. 78 Hawai' i 287, 290, 893 P.2d 138, 141 (1995). At the 
pretrial stage, Craft filed motions in limine seeking to exclude evidence of, in relevant part, her criminal record, alleged substance abuse, and alleged abuse by her spouse. Id. at 292, 
893 P.2d at 143. The circuit court granted Craft’s motion to exclude evidence of substance abuse, but denied as to evidence of her criminal record and her allegedly abusive spouse insofar as they were relevant to her claims of mental distress. Id. 
Because Craft did not make any objections to the introduction of the evidence at trial, this court noted that “objections not 
21
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
raised or properly preserved at trial will not be considered on
 
appeal.” Id. at 294, 893 P.2d at 145 (citing MPM Hawaiian, Inc.
 
v. Amigos, Inc., 63 Haw. 485, 630 P.2d 1075 (1982)).
 
Craft argued to this court that because the circuit
 
court had already denied her pretrial motions in limine to
 exclude the evidence, the definitive ruling exception mentioned
 in Lussier applied and she was not required to make further
 objections at trial to preserve that point of error on appeal. 
Id. at 294-95, 893 P.2d at 145-46. This court disagreed with
 Craft’s argument, stated that the rulings on the motions in
 limine “were preliminary in nature and were reserved for
 consideration during trial[,]” and quoted the following from the
 circuit court’s ruling:
 
[T]he [c]ourt is limiting its ruling solely on the grounds
raised in the Motion in Limine.  To the extent that the
 [c]ourt grants or denies a Motion in Limine, if there are
further foundational requirements that need to be met, the
proponents of the introduction of the evidence shall also
meet these foundational requirements, so for example, if the
[c]ourt is denying a motion in limine pertaining to the
admission of certain evidence, the [c]ourt is only ruling on
the issue raised in the motion.
 
Id. at 295, 893 P.2d at 146 (some brackets added and some
 
brackets removed; emphasis added). This court thus concluded
 that the definitive ruling exception did not apply and that
 objections at trial were required because the circuit court “did
 not rule with certainty that the evidence concerning Craft’s
 criminal record and family problems would be allowed into
 
22
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
evidence. Instead, it expressly reserved the right to rule on
 
the subject evidence until the foundational grounds were
 satisfied during trial.” Id.
 
Shortly thereafter, the ICA commented on motions in 
limine in Page v. Domino’s Pizza, Inc., 80 Hawai' i 204, 908 P.2d 
552 (App. 1995). There, Michael Page brought suit claiming damages arising from an incident inside a Domino’s store where the stool on which he had been sitting suddenly collapsed. Id. 
at 205-06, 908 P.2d at 553-54. On appeal, Domino’s argued in part that the circuit court “erred in denying its motion in limine to exclude evidence of prior incidents involving the collapse of two other stools in the same Domino’s store and in subsequently allowing admission of such evidence over objection.” Id. at 205, 908 P.2d at 553. Based on its review of the motion in limine hearing, the ICA determined that the circuit court unequivocally decided that it would deny the motion in limine and admit Page’s prior incident evidence. See id. at 208 n.4, 908 
P.2d at 556 n.4 (“THE COURT: . . . I’m going to allow it. . . . Yeah, I’m going to let it in.”); see also id. at 205 n.1, 908 P.2d at 553 n.1 (citing Craft, 78 Hawai' i at 294-95, 893 P.2d at 
145-46; Lussier, 4 Haw. App. at 393, 667 P.2d at 826) (“[W]e conclude that the trial court’s ruling on Domino’s motion in limine, see n.4 infra, amounted to an ‘unequivocal holding’ 
23
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
concerning the issue raised, thereby removing the need for
 
Domino[’s] to renew its objection during trial.”).
 
The most recent discussion on the law of motions in 
limine in this jurisdiction appears in the 2002 Barcai case,10 in 
which the family of Francis Barcai brought a medical malpractice action against Jon Betwee, M.D. after Barcai was found dead in the psychiatric ward of Maui Memorial Hospital. 98 Hawai' i at 
474, 50 P.3d at 950. Barcai was initially admitted to the hospital on June 11, 1990 in a psychotic state but became calmer and consented to psychiatric treatment after receiving antipsychotic medication. Id. at 473, 50 P.3d at 949. After 
treatment by several doctors yielded positive results, Barcai again began to suffer from panic and anxiety after June 13; on June 19, Dr. Betwee prescribed Stelazine, an antipsychotic medication, and although Barcai’s condition alternately improved and worsened, he was found dead on the morning of June 27. Id. 
at 473-74, 50 P.3d at 949-50. An autopsy did not reveal the cause. Id. at 474, 50 P.3d at 950. Barcai’s family filed a 
complaint against Betwee and Maui Memorial Hospital, primarily alleging medical negligence for failure to diagnose and treat the

 In one other case, this court agreed with the appellant that an 
unequivocal pretrial ruling admitting evidence “was sufficient to preserve the
issue for appeal.”  Ditto v. McCurdy, 98 Hawai 'i 123, 130 n.9, 44 P.3d 274, 
281 n.9 (2002) (citing Craft, 78 Hawai 'i at 295, 893 P.2d at 146; Page, 80 
Hawai'i at 205 n.1, 908 P.2d at 553 n.1; Lussier, 4 Haw. App. at 393-94, 667
P.2d at 826).

  they claimed to be the cause of
 neuroleptic malignant syndrome
Barcai’s 
death.12 Id.
 
Before trial, Barcai’s family filed motions in limine
 
to exclude evidence of Barcai’s prior violent acts, as well as
 any reference to Barcai’s hospitalization at the Hawai' i State 
Hospital in 1989. 
Id. at 474-75, 50 P.3d at 950-51. The circuit
 
court ruled that evidence of Barcai’s history would be
 inadmissible because of an agreement between the parties that Dr.
 Betwee’s treatment of Barcai was not based on Barcai’s past
 behavior and an offer by Barcai’s family to dismiss certain
 claims that would implicate the prior violence evidence. Id. at
 
475, 50 P.3d at 951. The next day, following jury selection,
 defense counsel asked the court to reconsider its ruling on the
 grounds that Dr. Betwee would testify that he had taken Barcai’s
 history of violence into account during treatment and that
 
11 Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) “is a relatively rare but 
potentially serious complication of antipsychotic medication that[,] at the
time of Barcai’s hospitalization, was thought to be fatal in approximatelyfour to twenty[-]nine percent of cases.”   Barcai, 98 Hawai 'i at 473, 50 P.3d
at 949 (citing Gerard Addonizio & Virginia Lehmann Susman, NeurolepticMalignant Syndrome: A Clinical Approach 7-8, 87-88 (1991)).  “Earlyrecognition of NMS and discontinuation of the offending antipsychoticmedication is critical; in general, it is thought that the earlier the signsand symptoms of NMS are recognized and the offending medication is stopped,the better the patient’s chances for survival.”  Id. (citing Addonizio & Susman, supra, at 52). 
12
 Barcai’s family also alleged false imprisonment, battery, 
negligent infliction of emotional distress, and negligent failure to obtaininformed consent before administering the antipsychotic medication.  Barcai ,
98 Hawai 'i at 474, 50 P.3d at 950.  The claims against Maui Memorial Hospital
were resolved by way of summary judgment and stipulated dismissal by theparties; consequently, Dr. Betwee was the only defendant at trial.  Id. 
25
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Barcai’s family had already stipulated to allowing Barcai’s
 
medical records, which contained references to Barcai’s past
 violence and prior hospitalization, into evidence. Id. Although
 
Barcai’s family argued that such a change in the court’s ruling
 would prejudice them because they could have questioned potential
 jurors for bias related to Barcai’s prior violence if they knew
 the evidence would be admissible, the court reversed its earlier
 ruling and decided the evidence was admissible. Id.
 
On appeal, Barcai’s family argued that the circuit
 
court’s reversal of its initial ruling after jury selection
 deprived them of their right to exercise their peremptory and
 for-cause challenges and therefore impaired their right to a fair
 and impartial jury because they relied on the initial ruling and
 did not attempt to excuse “those potential jurors who may have
 been biased against Barcai due to his history of violence.” Id.
 
at 476, 50 P.3d at 952. In an opinion written by Chief Justice
 Moon, this court rejected that argument: Barcai’s family did not
 point to anything in the record that showed Barcai’s past
 violence was even discussed at trial; therefore, Barcai’s family
 could not demonstrate that they suffered any actual prejudice in
 jury selection or in the outcome of the trial. Id. In fact,
 
this court specifically noted that the only evidence of Barcai’s
 prior violence that was admitted had been offered by Barcai’s
 
26
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
family as part of the medical record to which both parties had
 
stipulated; moreover, they had offered the evidence before the
 circuit court made its initial in limine ruling. Id. at 477, 50
 
P.3d at 953. This court therefore held that there was no
 impairment of Barcai’s family’s right to a fair and impartial
 jury because they “could not have relied upon the trial court’s
 initial ruling in the first place to assume that they did not
 have to question potential jurors about their attitudes towards
 violence and cannot [on appeal] blame the trial court for their
 own decision not to do so.” Id.
 
In a separate concurrence, Justice Acoba, joined by
 
Justice Ramil, agreed with the court’s result in concluding that
 Barcai’s family had suffered no prejudice as a result of the
 circuit court reversing its initial ruling on the motion in
 limine, but disagreed with Dr. Betwee’s argument that Barcai’s
 family could not rely on the circuit court’s initial ruling and
 that they “should have anticipated its reversal[.]” Id. at 488,
 
50 P.3d at 964 (Acoba, J., concurring). Whereas the majority
 opinion focused on the motion in limine only as it was relevant
 to the fair and impartial jury argument, presumably because that
 was the scope of the issue raised on appeal, Justice Acoba’s
 concurring opinion explored in more detailed fashion the purposes
 of motions in limine and the rationales supporting the reasoning
 
27
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
that parties should be able to rely on a court’s rulings on such
 
motions. He stated:
 
[Dr. Betwee]’s approach [in arguing that Barcai’s family
erred in relying on the trial court’s initial in limine
ruling] places the responsibility on litigants to second-
guess each in limine ruling a trial court makes.  In such a
 setting, the court’s order remains subject to question, the
precise situation sought to be avoided by obtaining an in
limine ruling.  If the parties cannot rely on the court’s
ruling, chaos will result.  Inasmuch as parties reasonably
expect courts to abide by their decisions on such motions,
we should not place the onus on a party to speculate as to
whether a particular ruling on a motion in limine will later
be reversed by the trial court.  For the same reason, we
should not engage in a post-trial analysis as to whether
such a guess was appropriate or not, as [Dr. Betwee] would
apparently invite us to do.
 
Id. “The motion in limine affords an opportunity to the court to 
rule on the admissibility of evidence in advance,” id. at 489, 50 
P.3d at 965 (quoting Kuroda v. Kuroda, 87 Hawai' i 419, 427, 958 
P.2d 541, 550 (App. 1998)) (internal citations omitted; emphasis removed), and in doing so it “is intended to establish the parameters for the introduction of evidence at trial[,]” id. (citing State v. Gonsalves, 5 Haw. App. 659, 668, 706 P.2d 1333, 1340 (1985), overruled on other grounds by State v. Kelekolio, 74 Haw. 479, 849 P.2d 58 (1993)), and “also assists litigants in formulating their trial strategy.” Id. (citing 
United States v. Yannott, 42 F.3d 999, 1007 (6th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1182 (1995)). 
Justice Acoba thus noted that “[a]s a general matter,
 
parties should be able to rely on a court’s in limine rulings.” 
Id. Importantly, his concurrence also reaffirmed the logic of
 
28
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the unequivocal ruling exception first adopted by the ICA in
 
Lussier: “It follows, then, that a ruling on a motion in limine
 does not require further objection during trial to preserve an
 issue for appellate review because the matter had been previously
 raised, argued, and ruled on[.]” Id. at 490, 50 P.3d at 966
 
(citing Lussier, 4 Haw. App. at 393-94, 667 P.2d at 826). When a
 trial court’s ruling on a motion in limine is “unequivocal,” it
 is thereafter “illogical for litigants to have to consider
 whether or not their reliance on such rulings would be considered
 reasonable upon appellate review[.]” Id. at 491, 50 P.3d at 967.
 
On the other hand, when the court cannot render an
 
unequivocal pretrial ruling on the admissibility of the
 particular evidence because it must wait until foundational
 prerequisites are established at trial or a proper trial record
 is otherwise first developed, the court should accordingly
 “refrain from rendering a pretrial ruling and defer such ruling
 for trial.” Id. (citing United States v. Cline, 188 F. Supp. 2d
 
1287, 1291 (D. Kan. 2002) (internal citations omitted); State v.
 Dopp, 930 P.2d 1039, 1045-46 (Idaho App. 1996)). “If the trial
 court must defer ruling on the motion in limine, its decision
 should be expressly communicated to the parties and placed on the
 record.” Id. at 492, 50 P.3d at 968 (citation omitted).

B. Under the 2006 amendment to HRE Rule 103, which applies to
this case, the Kobashigawas did not waive any objection to the
circuit court’s admission of evidence and allowance of argument
commenting on their motive for filing suit
 
1. FRE Rule 103
 
Effective December 1, 2000, Federal Rules of Evidence
 
(FRE) Rule 103 was amended to include the following language, and
 currently
13 reads as follows:
 
(b) Not Needing to Renew an Objection or Offer of Proof.
  
Once the court rules definitively on the record--either
before or at trial--a party need not renew an objection or
offer of proof to preserve a claim of error for appeal.
 
This amendment essentially codified the definitive ruling
 
exception into the FRE and was intended to resolve the circuit
 split that had existed for many years regarding the issue of
 whether a contemporaneous objection to evidence proffered during
 trial is necessary after a court has denied a party’s pretrial
 motion in limine to exclude that same evidence.
 
Prior to 2000, “the pre-amendment version of FRE 103
 
did not clearly address the issue of whether, and in what
 circumstances, an objection raised via motion
 in limine  must be
 
renewed at trial to preserve it for appeal.” Christopher J.
 
13
 FRE Rule 103 was again amended in 2011, but only for the purpose
 
of making nonsubstantive stylistic changes.  See Fed. R. Evid. 103 advisory
committee’s note (“The language of Rule 103 has been amended as part of the
restyling of the Evidence Rules to make them more easily understood and to
make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.  These changes are
 intended to be stylistic only.  There is no intent to change any result in any
ruling on evidence admissibility.”).  As a result of the 2011 amendment, the
definitive ruling exception language was moved from FRE Rule 103(a) to FRE
Rule 103(b).

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Douglass, Objections, Renewals, and Preemptive Introductions:
 
Erasing Uncertainty by Revisiting FRE 103, 86 Iowa L. Rev. 949,
 960 (2001). Some circuits had held that a pretrial motion in
 limine alone was insufficient to preserve an objection for appeal
 and that a renewal of the objection was always required when the
 evidence was introduced during trial. See, e.g., Collins v.
 
Wayne Corp., 621 F.2d 777, 784 (5th Cir. 1980); Nw. Flyers, Inc.
 v. Olson Bros. Mfg., 679 F.2d 1264, 1275 n.27 (8th Cir. 1982);
 Hendrix v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., 776 F.2d 1492, 1504 (11th
 Cir. 1985). Other circuits, adopting the definitive ruling
 exception, held that an objection need not be renewed during
 trial when the trial court has made an explicit and definitive
 ruling on a pretrial motion in limine. See, e.g., Rosenfeld v.
 
Basquiat, 78 F.3d 84, 90-91 (2d Cir. 1996); Am. Home Assurance
 Co. v. Sunshine Supermarket, Inc., 753 F.2d 321, 324-25 (3d Cir.
 1985); Palmerin v. City of Riverside, 794 F.2d 1409, 1411-13 (9th
 Cir. 1986); United States v. Mejia-Alarcon, 995 F.2d 982, 985-88
 (10th Cir. 1993). As the Advisory Committee on Evidence worked
 on amending FRE Rule 103 during the 1990s, one circuit even
 preemptively adopted the Advisory Committee’s proposed amendment
 before it was finalized. See Wilson v. Williams, 182 F.3d 562,
 
565-66 (7th Cir. 1999) (en banc).
 
Under the amended rule, “an objection or offer of proof
 
31
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
need not be renewed to preserve a claim of error with respect to
 
a definitive pretrial ruling.” Fed. R. Evid. 103 advisory
 committee’s note. This is because “[w]hen the ruling is
 definitive, a renewed objection or offer of proof at the time the
 evidence is to be offered is more a formalism than a necessity.” 
Id. (citations omitted). “The requirement that the ruling be
 ‘definitive’ is clearly satisfied if the trial judge rules in an
 unequivocal manner, without reserving the matter for further
 consideration as the trial progresses and the evidence unfolds.” 
Christopher B. Mueller & Laird C. Kirkpatrick, 1 Federal Evidence
 § 1:10 (3d ed. 2007). The 2000 amendment thus effectively
 resolved the circuit split in favor of the courts holding that a
 pretrial motion in limine seeking exclusion of evidence preserved
 the moving party’s objection without requiring a renewal of the
 objection during trial so long as the trial court had
 definitively ruled on the motion. See, e.g., United States v.
 
Brown, 669 F.3d 10, 22 n.18 (1st Cir. 2012) (citing Fed. R. Evid.
 103(a)) (“The court explicitly denied Elaine’s request to exclude
 Monier’s testimony and so Elaine’s objection was properly
 preserved for purposes of appeal.”); Dream Games of Ariz., Inc.
 v. PC Onsite, 561 F.3d 983, 988 n.3 (9th Cir. 2009) (“The
 district court was sufficiently informed as to PC Onsite’s
 grounds for objection and denied that motion in a definitive
 
32
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
ruling. Therefore, PC Onsite’s objection to screen displays that
 
contain unprotectable elements has been preserved for appellate
 review.”); Mathis v. Exxon Corp., 302 F.3d 448, 459 n.16 (5th
 Cir. 2002) (citations omitted) (“The 2000 amendment to rule
 103(a) changed the law that had prevailed in this circuit. . . .
 Before the amendment, we required an objection at trial to
 preserve the error.”); Mukhtar v. Cal. State Univ., Hayward, 299
 F.3d 1053, 1062 (9th Cir. 2002) (citing Fed. R. Evid. 103(a)(2))
 (“Contemporaneous objection is not required where, as here, the
 trial court definitively ruled on a motion in limine after
 exploring CSUH’s objection.”).
 
2. HRE Rule 103
 A similar split of authority developed and continues to
 
exist among state appellate courts. As with the pre-2000 federal
 circuit split, state courts also fell on both sides of the
 question of whether an objection during trial was necessary after
 a party had unsuccessfully moved to exclude evidence by means of
 a pretrial motion in limine. Some courts held that a
 contemporaneous objection was required when evidence was
 introduced at trial even though the party had filed a pretrial
 motion in limine seeking to exclude that evidence.

 evidence without further objection during trial.

16 One notable exception is Kentucky Rules of Evidence (K.R.E.) Rule
 
103; while based on the FRE, K.R.E. Rule 103 has, since taking effect in 1992,
included a separate subsection (d) specifically addressing motions in limine:
 
(d) Motions in limine.  A party may move the court for a
ruling in advance of trial on the admission or exclusion of
evidence.  The court may rule on such a motion in advance of
trial or may defer a decision on admissibility until the
evidence is offered at trial.  A motion in limine resolved
 
by order of record is sufficient to preserve error for
appellate review.  Nothing in this rule precludes the court
from reconsidering at trial any ruling made on a motion in
limine.

Many of the states in which amendments were made are those that
 
had already substantially or completely modeled their rules of
 evidence on the FRE. Thus, for example, Pennsylvania Rules of
 Evidence (Pa.R.E.) Rule 103(a) was amended in 2001 (effective
 January 1, 2002) to add the same language found in the 2000
 amendment to FRE Rule 103(a): “Once the court makes a definitive
 ruling on the record admitting or excluding evidence, either at
 or before trial, a party need not renew an objection or offer of
 proof to preserve a claim of error for appeal.”
17 Pa. R. Evid.
 
103(a) & cmt.; see also Blumer v. Ford Motor Co., 20 A.3d 1222,
 1232 (Pa. Super. 2011) (citing Pa. R. Evid. 103 cmt.; Trach v.
 Fellin, 817 A.2d 1102, 1107 n.3 (Pa. Super. 2003) (en banc))
 (“Consistent with the above amendment to Pa.R.E. 103(a), a motion
 in limine may preserve an objection for appeal without any need
 to renew the objection at trial, but only if the trial court
 clearly and definitively rules on the motion.”). Colorado Rules
 of Evidence Rule 103(a) was amended in 2002 to add the same

Ky. R

17
 On January 17, 2013, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court issued an
 
order rescinding the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence and replacing it with a
restyled version modeled on the nonsubstantive amendments made to the FRE in
2011. See In re: Order Rescinding and Replacing the Pennsylvania Rules of
Evidence, No. 586 (Pa. Jan. 17, 2013); see also supra note 13 (referencing the
2011 FRE restyling).  The restyled version took effect on March 18, 2013.  As
 relevant to this opinion, the language containing the definitive ruling
exception moved from Pa.R.E. Rule 103(a) to Pa.R.E. Rule 103(b) and now
appears in a form identical to the current FRE Rule 103(b), which is quoted
supra Part III.A.1.

language found in the 2000 amendment to FRE Rule 103(a). See
 
Colo. R. Evid. 103(a); see also Camp Bird Colo., Inc. v. Bd. of
 
Cnty. Comm’rs, 215 P.3d 1277, 1289-90 (Colo. App. 2009)
 (“However, the mining company filed pretrial motions on these
 issues, and the trial court made definitive rulings on the record
 prior to trial. Once the trial court makes definitive rulings
 either at or before trial, the objecting party need not renew the
 objection contemporaneously during trial to preserve a claim of
 error on appeal. See CRE 103(a)(2). Thus, the issues were
 
preserved.”). Vermont Rules of Evidence Rule 103(a) was amended
 in 2004 to add the same language from the FRE. See Vt. R. Evid.
 
103(a) & cmt.; see also State v. Brink, 949 A.2d 1069, 1071-72
 (Vt. 2008) (citing Vt. R. Evid. 103 cmt.) (“Under the 2004
 amendments, a ‘definitive’ ruling on admissibility obviates the
 need for a renewed objection at trial.”); Spooner v. Town of
 Topsham, 973 A.2d 1202, 1204 (Vt. 2009) (referencing 2004
 amendment but concluding that the Town’s objection was not
 preserved for appeal because there was no definitive pretrial
 ruling and the Town did not renew its objection at trial). South
 Dakota’s version of Rule 103(a), codified at South Dakota
 Codified Laws (SDCL) § 19-9-3, was amended in 2006 to add the
 same language from the amended FRE Rule 103(a). See S.D.
 
Codified Laws § 19-9-3; see also In re Estate of Duebendorfer,

9-3 was amended effective July 1, 2006).
 
As in the aforementioned states, the HRE is based, in 
substantial part, on the FRE. See HRE Rule 102 cmt. (“Except for 
Articles III and V, these rules have as their model the Federal Rules of Evidence[.]”). Moreover, as in the aforementioned states, the Hawai' i Legislature amended HRE Rule 103(a) in 2006 
to include language identical to that found in the 2000 FRE Rule 103(a) amendment: “Once the court makes a definitive ruling on the record admitting or excluding evidence, either at or before trial, a party need not renew an objection or offer of proof to preserve a claim of error for appeal.” See 2006 Haw. Sess. Laws 
Act 73, § 1 at 129; Addison M. Bowman, Hawaii Rules of Evidence Manual, § 103-1[1][B] (2010-2011 ed.) (“The effect [of the 2006 amendment] is to eliminate the need to restate the objection or the proffer in any instance in which the ruling in limine was ‘definitive.’”); see also HRE Rule 103 cmt. (“This rule is identical with Fed. R. Evid. 103.”). Besides aligning HRE Rule 103 with the amended FRE Rule 103, it should be noted that the 2006 amendment also served to confirm the case law of this court and the ICA discussed supra in Part III.A that had already recognized the definitive ruling exception. See Lussier, 4 Haw. 
App. at 393-94, 667 P.2d at 826; Craft, 78 Hawai' i at 295, 893

Hawai'i at 490, 50 P.3d at 966 (Acoba, J., concurring). Thus, as 
HRE Rule 103 has not been further amended since 2006, the 
definitive ruling exception remains good law and must be applied when appropriate.

3. In this case, the trial court made a definitive ruling
on the admissibility of evidence regarding speculation on the
Kobashigawas’ motive in filing suit against the City, thus
preserving the issue for appeal
 
During the October 5, 2009 pretrial hearing, the
 
circuit court made its rulings on, inter alia, the Kobashigawas’
 
Motion in Limine No. 1, seeking exclusion of evidence and
 argument concerning speculation on the Kobashigawas’ motive in
 filing suit against the City, and No. 4, seeking exclusion of
 certain parts of Bailey’s deposition testimony. With regard to
 Motion in Limine No. 1, the court first indicated its inclination
 to deny the motion and then allowed the parties to make any
 further arguments for the record. The following exchange then
 took place:
 
MR. PARK[, counsel for the Kobashigawas]: Well, Your
Honor, I have to admit I’m surprised you would be denying
this because it’s established law that the motives of a
 
18
 Although the HRE has not undergone a systematic styling revision
 
as the FRE did in 2011 and the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence did in 2013,
those restylings explicitly made no substantive changes.  Thus, although the
definitive ruling exception language of HRE Rule 103(a) and FRE Rule 103(b)
are not currently stylistically identical, they remain substantively
identical.
 
38
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
party in bringing a lawsuit is not really, you know,
relevant and it is prejudicial, you know, to admit evidence
on that point.
THE COURT: I guess, just so that you can understand
where I’m coming from, Mr. Park, while in concept I do tend
to agree with you, but the fact of the matter is that bias,
interest and motive and credibility of witnesses are always
in play. And essentially the [c]ourt’s standard instruction
5.1 comes to mind where there’s a laundry list of things
that the jurors can consider in terms of evaluating the
weight and credibility of the witnesses’ testimony.
 
(Emphasis added). When then given the opportunity to speak, the
 
City stated:
 
MR. LEWALLEN[, deputy corporation counsel]: Your
Honor, just briefly, I think the complaint states for itself
the evidence they are going to present to the [c]ourt, the
plaintiffs will, as they are seeking monetary damages. It’s
 not going to be a secret.  And we have also -- by the way,
they are not seeking equitable relief from the [c]ourt or
anything like that.  There’s one thing that will be asked
for, and that’s money.  That issue is going to be there.
 
. . .
 
And once again, it’s going to be out there.  And this
 
issue is going to be there, whether or not someone is going
to harp on it, but it’s going to be a factual issue that’s
presented to the jury and we should be able to address that.
 
The court ruled on the motion as follows:
 
THE COURT: Well, to the extent that, you know, from
the standpoint that some of the more traditional arguments
can be made, obviously, in a case seeking money damages,
obviously, it comes up from time to time.  Certainly
arguments are made as far as the motivations are concerned.
With 
that, the [c]ourt will confirm its ruling, will
deny the motion, does intend to issue a cautionary, which I
will provide the parties with copies of what the [c]ourt has
sort of drafted  and then we can sort of visit this
 
sufficiency or propriety of the way those are drafted at a
later point.  But basically, the [c]ourt does intend to sort
of limit its consideration, any bias, interest or motive, if
any is shown.
All right.   So with that, that dispenses of
plaintiff’s number one.
 
(Emphases added). With regard to Motion in Limine No. 4, through
 
which the Kobashigawas sought to exclude certain statements made
 
39
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
by Bailey in her deposition testimony, the circuit court granted
 
in part and denied in part after argument by both parties. The
 court’s ruling on this motion was sufficiently specific as to
 which statements would be admitted and which would not:
 “Basically, the only portions that I’m going to sustain and
 disallow are those portions that I alluded to. The two portions
 that I addressed with Mr. Park will be permitted. And if I was
 unclear about that, I apologize.” 
A trial court’s ruling on a motion in limine is
 
definitive when it “leaves no question that the challenged
 evidence will or will not be admitted at trial[.]” Quad City
 
Bank & Trust v. Jim Kircher & Assocs., P.C., 804 N.W.2d 83, 90
 (Iowa 2011) (citing State v. Alberts, 722 N.W.2d 402, 406 (Iowa
 2006); State v. Miller, 229 N.W.2d 762, 768 (Iowa 1975)). 
Further, as we have discussed, when a definitive ruling has been
 made, “counsel need not renew its objection to the evidence at
 trial to preserve error.” Id. This is because “[i]n such a
 
situation, the decision on the motion has the effect of [an
 evidentiary] ruling.” Id. (citing State v. Tangie, 616 N.W.2d
 
564, 569 (Iowa 2000)) (first brackets added and second brackets
 in original; internal quotation marks omitted). We also note
 that “[t]he key to deciding whether the general rule or the
 [definitive ruling] exception applies in a given case is
 
40
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
determining what the trial court purported to do in its ruling.” 
Id. (citing Alberts, 722 N.W.2d at 406).
 
With these principles in mind, we conclude that the
 
circuit court’s rulings on Motion in Limine No. 1 and Motion in
 Limine No. 4 were definitive and therefore that the Kobashigawas’
 objections to the admission of the evidence allowed by those
 rulings were preserved for appeal. There is no need to expound
 further on the definitiveness of the ruling on Motion in Limine
 No. 4, as the court specifically ruled that certain statements
 from Bailey’s deposition testimony would be admitted at trial and
 that certain other statements were excluded. With regard to
 Motion in Limine No. 1, the circuit court stated in its ruling
 that “bias, interest[,] and motive . . . are always in play.” 
Accordingly, the court neither suggested that the introduction of
 such evidence would depend on any foundational prerequisites nor
 invited the Kobashigawas to renew their objection during trial or
 ask the court to reconsider its ruling. In fact, the
 definitiveness of the ruling on No. 1 is underlined by the
 court’s statement that it had already drafted a cautionary jury
 instruction--on its own initiative--on the basis that any
 evidence on motive would definitely be admitted once offered by
 the City. Given the foregoing, we emphasize that the court’s
 ruling on No. 1 was a definitive one because the court “did not
 
41
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
equivocate or state it would reconsider its ruling at trial.” 
Quad City, 804 N.W.2d at 90-91.
 
We thus contrast the circuit court’s rulings on Motion
 
in Limine No. 1 and Motion in Limine No. 4 with its ruling on
 Motion in Limine No. 2, through which the Kobashigawas had sought
 to exclude evidence and argument by the City regarding the number
 of pedestrian injuries or deaths at the mid-block crosswalk at
 issue in this case; such evidence would support the City’s
 argument that William’s death was a single, isolated incident. 
While Motion in Limine No. 2 is not at issue on appeal, we take
 note of the court’s ruling on that motion as an example of a non-
definitive ruling issued during the same pretrial hearing:
 
THE COURT: All right.  This is the [c]ourt’s ruling:
[c]ourt will respectfully at this point deny the motion and
permit the City, subject to appropriate foundation , to
introduce evidence, if it has this evidence, regarding
indications or lack of indications of other incidents at
 this crosswalk.  And it may not come down to specific
numbers, but certainly I think more generalized type of, I
guess, inference can be made basically from the lack of
that.  It will depend on whether or not you folks are able
to establish that foundation.
 
(Emphases added). The circuit court did not make any such
 
reservations in its rulings on No. 1 and No. 4. Accordingly, by
 obtaining definitive rulings on these motions, the Kobashigawas
 did not waive their objection, as articulated in their motions in
 limine, to evidence or argument speculating on their motive for
 bringing suit against the City; rather, given that such evidence
 and argument would unequivocably be admitted during trial, the
 
42
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Kobashigawas were entitled to rely in good faith on the court’s
 
rulings in formulating their trial strategy. Accordingly, the
 objection was preserved, even in the absence of renewed
 objections at the time such evidence and argument were presented
 by the City during trial.
 
4. In light of the court’s unequivocal ruling, the
Kobashigawas also did not waive their objection by introducing
the adverse evidence themselves
 
As a related matter, we note that, under the
 
circumstances of this case, the introduction of Bailey’s
 
objected-to deposition testimony by the Kobashigawas themselves
 in their case-in-chief also did not constitute a waiver of their
 objection to that evidence. Generally, a party cannot allege an
 error on appeal premised on evidence introduced into the record
 by that party. See, e.g., Carlyle v. Lai, 783 S.W.2d 925, 931
 
(Mo. App. 1989) (Fenner, J., dissenting) (“There cannot be a
 finding of prejudice when the information of which appellants
 complain was already placed before the jury by the appellants
 themselves.”). However, several appellate courts have concluded
 that when a trial court has denied a party’s motion in limine to
 exclude evidence likely to be introduced by the opposing party at
 trial, the moving party does not then waive its objection to the
 adverse evidence by preemptively introducing the evidence itself
 in its case-in-chief.
 
43
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
In Beil v. Mayer, a motor vehicle accident case, Beil
 
had filed a pretrial motion in limine to exclude evidence of the
 
amount of settlement agreements attained in lawsuits arising from
 two unrelated accidents, one predating and one postdating the
 accident at issue. 789 P.2d 1229, 1231 (Mont. 1990). The trial
 court denied the motion with respect to the later settlement and
 allowed Mayer to introduce evidence of the settlement amount;
 following denial of the motion, Beil stipulated to a statement of
 facts concerning the settlement amount and the statement was read
 to the jury during trial. Id. “Beil also voluntarily referred
 
to the settlement in his opening argument and through testimony
 during his case in chief.” Id. at 1232. The jury found Mayer
 
not negligent, and the trial court denied Beil’s motion for a new
 trial; on appeal, Beil argued that the trial court erred in
 admitting the settlement amount on the grounds that it was
 irrelevant and prejudicial. Id. at 1231. Mayer argued that the
 
settlement amount was relevant to the issue of damages and that
 Beil did not preserve the issue because he failed to renew his
 objection during trial and stipulated to agreed facts about the
 settlement. Id. at 1231, 1232-33. The Montana Supreme Court
 
agreed with Beil, noting that after his motion in limine
 regarding the settlement amount was denied,
 
he attempted to deal with its imminent introduction in the
best way that he could.  As a matter of trial tactics, he
 
44
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
brought up the settlement during his case in chief, so that
he could attempt to minimize its prejudicial impact.  He
 entered into the stipulation in an effort to prevent
needless disagreement over known facts which were part of
the settlement.
 
Id. at 1233. That court thus held that because the same evidence
 
that Beil sought to exclude was then introduced at trial, Beil’s
 original objection to the evidence was sufficient to preserve the
 issue for appeal. Id.
 
In O’Bryan v. Hedgespeth, also a motor vehicle accident
 
case, O’Bryan had filed a pretrial motion in limine to exclude
 evidence of collateral source payments he had received; the trial
 court noted the objection to the evidence but denied the motion. 
892 S.W.2d 571, 573 (Ky. 1995). Relying on the trial court’s
 ruling, O’Bryan himself introduced evidence of the amounts and
 sources of benefits he had received; although the jury entered a
 verdict for O’Bryan, it only awarded him the amount of his out­of-pocket medical expenses and did not make any award for the
 amount representing the collateral source payments. Id. The
 
Kentucky Supreme Court noted in its opinion that “[O’Bryan]
 elected to go forward with the evidence of collateral source
 payments in the presentation of [his] case once [his] motion in
 limine was overruled, rather than to leave it to the defendant to
 present this evidence.” Id. at 574. Although Hedgespeth argued
 
that the court should not assume she would have introduced the
 evidence if O’Bryan did not introduce it himself, the court
 
45
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
strongly and sharply disagreed: “The likelihood the defendant
 
would not present this evidence after prevailing against the
 motion in limine borders on absurdity.” Id. Accordingly, the
 
court held that “once a motion in limine to exclude evidence has
 been overruled, a party may go forward with adverse evidence to
 avoid the appearance of concealment and still ‘preserve error for
 appellate review.’” Id. at 575 (quoting Ky. R. Evid. 103(d)).
 
Most recently, the Florida Supreme Court spoke on this
 
subject in a case decided to resolve a split in the Florida
 district courts of appeal. In Sheffield v. Superior Insurance
 Co., also a motor vehicle accident case, Sheffield settled with
 the tortfeasor and then filed suit against Superior, her
 uninsured motor insurance carrier. 800 So. 2d 197, 199 (Fla.
 2001). As in O’Bryan, Sheffield filed a pretrial motion in
 limine “seeking to exclude collateral source evidence regarding
 both insurance and other benefits provided by her employer.” Id. 
After the trial court denied the motion, the parties “stipulated
 that Sheffield would have a standing objection to the
 introduction of collateral source evidence and would not have to
 contemporaneously or spontaneously object during trial in order
 to preserve the objection for appeal.”
19 Id. Sheffield then
 
19
 Sheffield was decided in 2001 and therefore predated the 2003
 
amendment to Florida’s version of FRE Rule 103, codified at Fla. Stat. Ann. §
90.104, incorporating the definitive ruling exception. See In re Amendments
 
(continued...)
 
46
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
“introduced collateral source evidence in her case-in-chief,
 
including the fact that she had group medical insurance to defray
 some of the costs of treatment.” Id. Also as in O’Bryan, the
 
jury returned a verdict for Sheffield but less than what she had
 sought; the trial court also denied her motion for a new trial on
 the issue of damages. Id. On appeal, the First District Court
 
of Appeal affirmed by a vote of 2-1, concluding that while the
 trial court erred in denying Sheffield’s motion in limine, “her
 own introduction of such collateral source evidence precludes
 reversal for a new trial on that ground.” Id. (quoting Sheffield
 
v. Superior Ins. Co., 741 So. 2d 533, 534 (Fla. App. 1999))
 (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). Judge Browning
 dissented, stating that “because Sheffield was faced with the
 trial court’s incorrect ruling, Sheffield had every right to
 attempt to defuse the issue and initially present collateral-
source evidence.” Id. at 200 (quoting Sheffield, 741 So. 2d at
 
540 (Browning, J., dissenting)). On further appeal, the Florida
 Supreme Court agreed with the First District majority that the
 trial court erred in denying Sheffield’s motion in limine and
 
19(...continued)
to th
e Florida Evidence Code-Section 90.104, 914 So. 2d 940, 941 (Fla. 2005)
(noting the amendment as passed by the Florida Legislature in 2003 and
adopting the amended rule “to the extent that it is procedural”).
Nevertheless, because the parties stipulated that a contemporaneous objection
was unnecessary for purposes of preserving the objection on appeal, the
analysis in Sheffield remains valid under the amended section 90.104.
 
47
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
allowing evidence of collateral sources; the question thus became
 
“whether Sheffield’s counsel, by introducing collateral source
 evidence in Sheffield’s case-in-chief after the trial court
 erroneously denied her motion in limine, waived any objection for
 appellate review.” Id. at 200-01. In trying to reconcile the
 
different approaches taken in different district courts of
 appeal, as well as by itself in a prior case, the Florida Supreme
 Court agreed with the general principles that a party should not
 be penalized for relying in good faith on a trial court’s
 incorrect ruling and that introduction of evidence adverse to a
 party does not waive that party’s objection to the evidence in
 light of the trial court’s previous denial of a motion in limine
 to exclude. See id. at 201-02. The court concluded that the
 
concept of invited error--and thus waiver of any objection--does
 not apply where the trial court makes an adverse, unequivocal
 evidentiary ruling that then forces a party to preemptively
 introduce the evidence as a matter of trial strategy to minimize
 its prejudicial impact. Id. at 202; see also Chenoweth v. Kemp,
 
396 So. 2d 1122, 1127 (Fla. 1981) (Sundberg, C.J., dissenting)
 (quoted in Sheffield, 800 So. 2d at 202) (“In light of this
 ruling, appellant had every right, and indeed had no choice, but
 to comment upon the evidence in an attempt to mitigate the damage
 soon to be done by the erroneous inclusion of the written
 
48
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
finding. Trial court error, not tactics, dictated appellant’s
 
actions.”). In quashing the First District’s judgment and
 remanding the case for a new trial, the court thus held: “once a
 trial court makes an unequivocal ruling admitting evidence over a
 movant’s motion in limine, the movant’s subsequent introduction
 of that evidence does not constitute a waiver of the error for
 appellate review.” Id. at 203.
 
In this case, the circuit court made an unequivocal
 
ruling that evidence adverse to the Kobashigawas would be
 admitted at trial. Faced with the inevitability that the City
 would introduce Bailey’s deposition testimony to support its
 theory of the Kobashigawas’ motive for filing suit, the
 Kobashigawas introduced the testimony themselves as a matter of
 trial strategy, aiming to minimize the prejudice that would
 result from admission of the evidence. By introducing the
 evidence themselves, the Kobashigawas sought to avoid putting
 themselves in a position where they would have to object in front
 of the jury after its introduction and each reference to it
 thereafter by the City. The Kobashigawas made these very
 arguments to the ICA, and although the ICA did not comment on
 them in its opinion, we agree with the Kobashigawas and the
 courts cited supra that have addressed this issue. In
 particular, we adopt the holding from Sheffield that once a trial
 
49
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
court makes an unequivocal ruling admitting evidence over a
 
party’s motion in limine to exclude, that party’s subsequent
 introduction of the evidence does not constitute a waiver of its
 objection for appellate review.
 
For all of the foregoing reasons, the Kobashigawas
 
preserved their objection to admission of any evidence and
 argument speculating on their motive for filing suit despite the
 denial of their pretrial motions in limine and their subsequent
 self-introduction of the adverse evidence. The ICA, therefore,
 did not need to resort to plain error review to reach the merits
 of the error alleged by the Kobashigawas on appeal. We now turn
 to the merits.
 
C. The ICA did not err in concluding that the errors occurring
during trial warranted remanding the case for a new trial
 
1. The ICA did not err in holding that the circuit court’s
cautionary jury instruction was an erroneous statement of the law
 
In its application to this court, the City first argues
 
that the ICA gravely erred in concluding that the circuit court’s
 
cautionary jury instruction on bias, interest, or motive
 constituted an erroneous statement of the law because, according
 to HRE Rule 609.1, evidence pertaining to a witness’s bias,
 interest, or motive is always admissible.
 
HRE Rule 609.1 states, in full:
 
(a) General rule.  The credibility of a witness may be
attacked by evidence of bias, interest, or motive.
 
50
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(b) Extrinsic evidence of bias, interest, or motive. 
Extrinsic evidence of a witness’ bias, interest, or motive
is not admissible unless, on cross-examination, the matter
is brought to the attention of the witness and the witness
is afforded an opportunity to explain or deny the matter.
 
This rule is often invoked in the context of criminal cases; as 
this court has stated, “[b]ias, interest, or motive is always relevant under HRE Rule 609.1. So long as a proper foundation is laid, bias can be raised at any time by the witness’s testimony or other evidence.” State v. Estrada, 69 Haw. 204, 220, 738 P.2d 
812, 823 (1987) (citing State v. Murphy, 59 Haw. 1, 575 P.2d 448 (1978)). Of course, the rule also applies to witnesses in civil cases: for example, the ICA cited to the rule in Coyle v. Compton, 85 Hawai' i 197, 210, 940 P.2d 404, 417 (App. 1997), and 
Cenal v. Ragunton, 106 Hawai' i 298, 304, 104 P.3d 336, 342 (App. 
2004). (In both of those cases, however, the evidence that would have been used to impeach the witnesses was ultimately excluded under HRE Rule 403
20 as being more prejudicial than probative.) 
The circuit court was therefore correct only insofar as
 
it stated, by quoting Rule 609.1, that the credibility of a
 witness may be attacked by evidence of bias, interest, or motive,
 and that such evidence pertaining to a witness’s credibility is
 always relevant and admissible at trial. The circuit court
 
20
 HRE Rule 403 provides: “Although relevant, evidence may be
 
excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of
unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by
considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of
cumulative evidence.”
 
51
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
erred, however, in ruling that such evidence could be used by the
 
jury in considering the Kobashigawas’ motives as plaintiffs in
 filing the present lawsuit.
 
As the Kobashigawas argued and the ICA recognized, it 
is a long-standing principle of law that a plaintiff’s motive in filing a lawsuit is otherwise immaterial to resolving the merits of the dispute. Kobashigawa, 126 Hawai' i at 65, 266 P.3d at 473; 
see also Dickerman v. N. Trust Co., 176 U.S. 181, 190 (1900) (“If the law concerned itself with the motives of parties new complications would be introduced into suits which might seriously obscure their real merits.”); Carter v. Ah So, 12 Haw. 291, 302 (1899) (“So far as the law is concerned, if the plaintiff has made out a case on the facts, it is immaterial what [the] motive was.”); Lucas v. American-Hawaiian Eng’g & Constr. Co., 16 Haw. 80, 85-86 (1904) (“[T]he weight of authority is that the motives of a taxpayer in bringing a suit can not be inquired into if he has shown that he has the other qualifications to sue. . . . That motives can not be inquired into is well settled.”); Karim v. Gunn, 999 A.2d 888, 890 (D.C. 2010) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (“The motive of a party in bringing an action generally is immaterial to the question whether the action may be maintained.”); Somers v. AAA Temp. Servs., 284 N.E.2d 462, 465 (Ill. App. 1972) (“It is 
52
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
generally accepted that where the plaintiff asserts a valid cause
 
of action, [the plaintiff’s] motive in bringing the action is
 immaterial.”).
 
The City argues to this court that the cases cited by
 
the ICA and the Kobashigawas, and mentioned immediately supra,
 are inapposite because they do not address the issue of “whether
 evidence pertaining to a plaintiff’s motive for filing suit may
 be properly considered for the purposes of assessing a witness’
 credibility.” In framing the issue in such a manner, however, it
 appears that the City confuses, as it also did in the trial court
 and before the ICA, motive evidence permissible under Rule 609.1
 to impeach the credibility of a witness with evidence of the
 plaintiff’s motive for filing suit, which, as discussed, is
 irrelevant and thus inadmissible. Under Rule 609.1, “[t]he
 credibility of a witness may be attacked by evidence of bias,
 interest, or motive” of that witness. A plain reading of the
 rule does not suggest that testimony of a witness, even a
 disinterested one such as Bailey here, may somehow be used to
 suggest that the Kobashigawas had an improper motive in filing
 suit. Looking beyond the rule, there is also no other authority
 for the proposition that, pursuant to Rule 609.1, the testimony
 of a witness may be used to question the bias, interest, or
 motive of the plaintiff bringing the suit. 
53
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Thus, based on well-established and long-standing
 
precedent, a plaintiff’s motive in filing a lawsuit is irrelevant
 
provided that the plaintiff has established a valid cause of
 action, and we agree with the ICA that the circuit court erred
 here in instructing the jury to consider certain evidence for
 that purpose even though the instruction was given as a
 cautionary, limiting one.
 
2. The ICA did not err in concluding that the circuit
court erred in allowing the City to comment on motive during its
closing argument
 
The City also argues in its application that the ICA
 
erred by concluding that the circuit court erred in allowing the
 
City to comment on the Kobashigawas’ motive during its closing
 argument. Rather, the City contends that nothing in its closing
 argument was improper because it simply commented on evidence
 that had been properly admitted by the circuit court during
 trial. As quoted supra in Part I.B, the City made two separate
 references in its closing argument to Bailey’s testimony and the
 issue of the Kobashigawas’ monetary motive in filing suit against
 the City. Because the Kobashigawas’ motive in filing suit was
 never relevant to the City’s liability under a negligence theory,
 the City should not have been allowed to reference it, in closing
 or at any other time. As we have thoroughly discussed, the
 circuit court’s ruling to admit evidence and allow argument on
 
54
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
motive was in error, and its cautionary instruction given to the 
jury contained an erroneous statement of the law. As the ICA noted, “erroneous instructions are presumptively harmful and are a ground for reversal unless it affirmatively appears from the record as a whole that the error was not prejudicial.” Kobashigawa, 126 Hawai' i at 66, 266 P.3d at 474 (quoting Nelson, 
97 Hawai' i at 386, 38 P.3d at 105) (internal quotation marks and 
brackets omitted). In examining the record as a whole, including the motions in limine, the trial proceedings, the erroneous instruction, and the City’s closing argument, it does appear that the error was prejudicial to the Kobashigawas, and we agree with the following conclusion in the ICA’s opinion: 
Because an improper jury instruction requires the error to
be read in light of the record as a whole and [the] City’s
closing argument added to the harm caused by the circuit
court’s erroneous jury instruction, the circuit court erred
in allowing [the] City to comment in its closing argument on
the Kobashigawas’ motives.
 
Id. at 66-67, 266 P.3d at 474-75; see also Kakligian v. Henry 
Ford Hosp., 210 N.W.2d 463, 465 (Mich. App. 1973) (quoted in Kobashigawa, 126 Hawai' i at 66, 266 P.3d at 474) (noting that “in 
conjunction with the lower court’s failure to properly instruct the jury, a defense counsel’s reference to the plaintiff’s motive in bringing suit was grounds for a new trial”). 
Thus, the ICA did not err in concluding that the
 
circuit court erred in allowing the City to comment during its
 
55
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
closing argument about the Kobashigawas’ motive for filing suit. 
Because the closing argument added to and was intertwined with
 the harm introduced by the court’s erroneous jury instruction on
 motive, we cannot say that the ICA erred in vacating the circuit
 court’s judgment on this additional ground.
 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
Accordingly, subject to the foregoing discussion
 
modifying the ICA’s December 2, 2011 published opinion, we affirm
 the ICA’s December 22, 2011 judgment vacating the Judgment
 Pursuant to Special Verdict filed in circuit court on March 25,
 2010 and remanding this case for a new trial.
