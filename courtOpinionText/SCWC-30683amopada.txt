AMENDED OPINION OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J.
 
I. Introduction
 
In this appeal, a youth correctional officer (“YCO”) found 
liable for sexual assault against a ward seeks review of the 
ICA’s Judgment on Appeal, entered pursuant to its Memorandum Opinion, which remanded this case for a new trial limited to the issue of allocation of fault and damages, due to an irreconcilable conflict in the jury’s special verdict answers. Costales v. Rosete, No. 30683 (App. May 30, 2012) (mem.) at 21. The YCO seeks a completely new trial without limitation on the basis that he was prejudiced by the admission of evidence of his State co-defendants’ bad acts. He also seeks to preclude judgment against him in his individual capacity based upon 
Hawai‘i Revised Statutes (“HRS”) § 662-10 (1993)’s “judgment 
bar,” which states, “The judgment in an action [against the State 
under the State Tort Liability Act] shall constitute a complete bar to any action by the claimant, by reason of the same subject matter, against the employee of the State whose act or omission gave rise to the claim.” 
Associate Justice Acoba, who heard oral argument and signed the opinion
 
filed on February 27, 2014, retired on February 28, 2014.
 
2
 1 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
We hold that the ICA was correct in limiting the issues on
 
re-trial to the allocation of fault and damages, but it should
 
have further limited the damages issues to be re-tried to the
 measure of general and special damages each defendant should pay,
 with the jury properly instructed on when each defendant can be
 held liable in his individual (versus official) capacity. We
 also hold that in this case HRS § 662-10 does not bar
 contemporaneous judgments against the State and against Rosete in
 his individual capacity. 
We therefore vacate the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal, entered
 
pursuant to its Memorandum Opinion, and affirm the circuit
 court’s order granting Rosete a new trial, with the issues
 limited on re-trial in a manner consistent with this opinion.
 II. Background
 A. Complaint and Answer
 
On December 13, 2007, Plaintiff Stacey Costales filed her 
Complaint against Scott Rosete (a YCO at Hawai‘ i Youth 
Correctional Facility, or “HYCF”), in his individual and official capacities, Melvin Ando (a former HYCF administrator), in his individual and official capacities, Glenn Yoshimoto (a former HYCF correction supervisor), in his individual and official 
capacities, the State of Hawai‘ i, Department of Human Services 
(“DHS”), and the Office of Youth Services (“OYS”). Count One of 
the Complaint alleged Assault and Battery, as against Rosete. 
3
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Costales alleged that Rosete took her out of her cell and
 
sexually assaulted her in 2002 while she was a minor ward
 detained at HYCF. 
Count Two of the Complaint alleged Negligence, as against
 
the State, OYS, DHS, Yoshimoto, and Ando for failing to protect
 Costales from harm. Specifically, Costales alleged negligent
 hiring, supervision, and retention of Rosete; negligent failure
 to properly train the HYCF YCOs, including Rosete; negligent
 failure to properly and thoroughly investigate assaults and
 batteries committed by HYCF YCOs, including Rosete; negligent
 failure to adequately reprimand YCOs, including Rosete, to
 prevent them from harming other wards or from working at HYCF;
 negligent management of HYCF; and negligent and unreasonable
 failure to adopt and implement policies and procedures to
 supervise and care for wards detained at HYCF in order to prevent
 assaults and batteries against wards. Costales alleged that Ando
 and Yoshimoto were not protected by qualified immunity because
 these defendants acted with malice and/or for an improper
 purpose. Costales further alleged that these defendants endorsed
 a pattern or practice of conduct that created an unreasonably
 dangerous condition at HYCF. 
Count Three of the Complaint alleged Intentional and
 
Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress by each of the
 defendants. Count Four of the Complaint sought punitive damages
 
4
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
against Rosete, Ando, and Yoshimoto. Costales prayed for
 
general, compensatory, and special damages in an amount to be
 proven at trial; punitive damages; pre- and post-judgment
 interest; and such other and further relief as the court deemed
 just and equitable. 
Rosete then filed his Answer to Plaintiff’s Complaint, 
denying the allegations contained in the First, Second, and Third Claims. He also raised HRS § 662-10 as a defense, arguing that Costales was barred “from obtaining judgment against both the 
State of Hawai‘ i (including any State agency, employee, or 
official, in an official capacity) and Defendant Rosete.” 
B. Trial 
Rosete, in his individual capacity, was tried along with the
 
rest of the defendants. Rosete, in his individual capacity, was
 
tried by a jury. The jury was advisory as to the remaining
 defendants.
 
1. Testimony of Former Wards
 
At trial, Costales called as witnesses three former wards
 
who were residing at HYCF at the time of the alleged assault. 
Each testified that Rosete was physically and verbally abusive. 
One ward testified that Rosete had discussed sex with her and
 sexually touched her as well. The former wards testified that
 the other YCOs saw Rosete’s behavior but did nothing about it. 
They also testified that they did not report Rosete because they
 
5
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
were scared of him, and Rosete would boast that nothing would
 
happen to him if they reported him anyway. 
The former wards also testified that for months, Rosete and
 
another YCO would bring out certain girls (including Costales) at
 night, paper over the windows to the girls’ dorm so the other
 wards would not see what was happening, give the girls food and
 cigarettes, receive massages, and sleep while the girls punched
 their time cards.
 
Regarding whether Rosete allegedly sexually assaulted
 
Costales, one former ward testified that Costales had returned
 from being taken out one night and was “crying and said she was
 scared, she didn’t know what to do.” The former ward testified
 that Costales told her Rosete “had sex. He put it in two times
 and then pulled out.” Another former ward testified that on the
 night of the alleged sexual assault, Costales looked scared and
 begged her to stay up all night with her, telling her in
 incomplete sentences only such information as, “[Rosete] took me
 to [an isolation room]. There was a mattress.” Costales stopped
 short of full disclosure to this former ward. 
2. Testimony of Carl Imakyure
 
Costales also called Carl Imakyure, a Children and Youth
 
Specialist V with the Office of Youth Services, a division within
 the State of Hawaii’s Department of Human Services. He testified
 that late 2004 or early 2005, he was asked to conduct a “systems
 
6
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
investigation into HYCF,” in other words, to look at “regular
 
patterns of behavior pertaining . . . to programs, staff
 training, any incidents of neglect or abuse, anything that would
 seem to be consistent over at the HYCF,” with a focus on
 Yoshimoto’s contribution to the institutional culture. The
 relevant time frame for Imakyure’s systems investigation was from
 2000 or 2001 up to 2003 or 2004, but he looked at data from 1999
 to 2003. 
Imakyure’s report concluded that there was a “lack of
 
training” at HYCF, that Yoshimoto had a difficult time
 disciplining the staff such that “there was a continuing pattern
 of abuse by staff by particular YCOs,” and that “the YCOs did not
 have the kind of close oversight and supervision needed at that
 time to ensure the safety and the care of these youths.” 
Imakyure testified that he concluded in his report that Yoshimoto
 was grossly negligent. He also acknowledged that his report
 questioned whether Yoshimoto possessed compassion for the youth
 at HYCF. Imakyure testified that he did not recall coming across
 any information in his investigation concerning Rosete. The
 record does not reflect that Rosete requested a limiting
 instruction during Imakyure’s testimony (or during the final
 charge to the jury). 
3. Testimony of Harold Fitchett
 
7
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Costales called Harold Fitchett, an investigator with the
 
Attorney General’s office, whom Ando asked to investigate
 
Rosete’s rumored sex assault of Costales. Fitchett tape-recorded
 his interview with Costales, which took place on June 7, 2002. 
On the recording, Costales explained that Rosete committed
 misconduct of a sexual nature “four or five times” in January or
 February 2002, shortly before she was released from HYCF. 
Costales stated that Rosete and another YCO would remove her and
 another ward from their dormitory during the first shift, and the
 two girls would punch the time clock for the YCOs. She stated
 that the first time Rosete sexually assaulted her, she was lying
 on a couch in the staff area, Rosete laid next to her, and “was
 fingering [her] on top of the [couch]” and “pulling [her] pants
 and doing whatever to [her].” She stated that Rosete told her to
 be quiet and that she was scared, so she did not say anything. 
Costales stated that Rosete also “fondl[ed her] breast and stuff
 . . . with his hands.” Costales stated that, although she was
 not physically hurt, she was scared because Rosete had beaten up
 other wards in the past. 
Costales stated that the second incident of sexual assault
 
happened two or three days after the first and was similar to the
 first. Costales stated that the third incident consisted of
 “nothing physical,” but “sexual comments.” Rosete told her he
 “want[ed] to fuck [her] brains out,” and that they “look[ed]
 
8
      *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
sexy.” Costales stated that, by the time the fourth incident
 
came around, she was “just fucken losing it” because she was
 scared of Rosete and what would happen next. She stated that
 Rosete came into her cell that night, “laid on [her] bed with
 [her] and covered [her] mouth. And he was just, like, kissing
 [her] neck, kissing [her] ear.” Costales said she started crying
 and asking Rosete why he was doing this to her, and Rosete
 covered her mouth and told her to “shut up.” At that point, a
 timer bell went off, and Rosete left Costales’ cell to punch the
 clock. When he returned, he removed Costales from her cell and
 took her to an isolation room in the back of the dorm. Costales
 stated that Rosete “laid [her] down on the mattress in the back
 of the dorms and he was fingering [her] once again, um, just
 kissing [her] . . . doing things with [her]. . . And then he
 tried to shove his [penis] in [her]. . . . . And when he shoved
 it in, he shoved it in.” Rosete stopped because he heard a noise
 and went to check on it. In the meantime, Costales returned to
 her cell, washed herself off, and another ward asked her what
 happened. When Rosete returned, he called her a “fucken[] bitch”
 and stated that she “ruined it all” because he “wanted to do
 things to [her].” 
Costales also told Fitchett that another YCO had sexually
 
assaulted one ward and physically assaulted other wards,
 including Costales. Fitchett further testified that he was
 
9
  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
directed by the union representing the HYCF YCOs to destroy all
 
the records of his investigations into the abuses at HYCF. 
4. Testimony of Linda Hadley
 
Costales called Linda Hadley, a former nurse and
 
administrator at HYCF. She testified that she told a senate
 committee about “[v]erbal abuse, physical abuse. . .[,] sexual
 abuse,” and the “lack of concern by administration to provide the
 safety that was needed for the kids” at HYCF. Hadley testified
 to the lack of training or supervision of the YCOs. Hadley was
 familiar with Rosete and characterized him as a “very
 authoritative person” who “[l]ike[d] to have control over the
 kids.” Hadley did not know that Costales had been assaulted. 
The record does not reflect that Rosete requested a limiting
 instruction at the time of Hadley’s testimony (or during the
 final charge to the jury).
 
5. Testimony of Lia Olione
 
Lia Olione, an HYCF YCO, had his deposition testimony read
 
into evidence after he invoked his Fifth Amendment right against
 self-incrimination and was declared unavailable. 
The circuit
 
court allowed portions of his deposition in another HYCF guard­on-ward sexual assault case to be read to the jury
2
 as relevant
to the other defendants’ notice, over Rosete’s objection that the
 
That deposition testimony was not transcribed by the court reporter, 
even though this court required such transcription in Roxas v. Marcos, 89
Hawai ‘i 91, 100 n.2, 969 P.2d 1209, 1218 n.2 (1998). 
10
 2  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
testimony violated Hawai� i Rules of Evidence (“HRE”) Rules 401, 
402, 403, 404, 602, and 802, and that he was not noticed for the
 
deposition. Relevant to Rosete’s appeal, Olione testified to the
 following:
 
-- He received no training, including how to deal with
adolescents, when he was hired by HYCF.
-- He did not believe he and the other YCOs were adequately
supervised by their immediate superiors or by Ando and
Yoshimoto.
   
-- He slept on the job because “[n]obody check[ed] on
[him].”  
-- He opined, “I don’t think anybody checks on anybody in
that facility.”  He opined that “[e]verybody was doing as
they see fit,” including supervisors.
   
-- A female ward told him that YCOs were having sex with
female wards.  Although he knew such contact was prohibited,
he did not report it to Ando or Yoshimoto because “[t]he
whole facility was out of control . . . Nobody was doing
anything.”
   
-- He agreed that YCOs verbally abused the wards and that
this abuse went unreported to Ando or Yoshimoto.  
-- Abusive YCOs were allowed to keep their positions and
continue their verbally, physically, and/or sexually abusive
behavior . 
-- He agreed that the YCOs -— not the HYCF administration –­
were in control and that the resulting atmosphere was one of
desperation and terror for the wards.  
-- There was a “lack of discipline . . . almost to the point
where we [YCOs] [we]re encouraged to do wrong since there
[wa]s no discipline, and no close supervision. . . .”
 
6. Testimony of Glenn Yoshimoto
 
Costales called Glenn Yoshimoto, who testified that a YCO
 
accused of sexually harassing a ward continued to work at HYCF
 
“until he went to prison.” Because the parties acknowledged that
 Yoshimoto opened the door
3
 regarding YCO Lia Olione’s conviction
for sexual assault, the parties agreed with the circuit court to
 
Evidence of other lawsuits against the State, particularly Ruiz v. State
 
of Hawaii, et al., Civil No. 04-1-1739-09 (KSSA), which arose from a 2003
alleged sex assault of a ward by Olione, had been previously excluded by an
order granting in part and denying in part one of the State’s motions in
limine.
 
11
 3 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
stipulate to the fact of conviction. The stipulation read to the
 
jury was as follows:
 
The parties in this case through their lawyers have
stipulated to certain facts and you must consider those
facts as having been conclusively proved.
The facts that they have stipulated to are that Mr.
Olione was found guilty of and stated the following:
On June 15, 2003, while employed at a
State correctional facility I had sexual
intercourse and  inserted my finger into the
vagina of SM . . . an inmate/ward of the
correctional facility.
I also touched the breasts of
 
inmate[/]ward SM a person less than 16 but at
least fourteen who was more than five years
younger than myself and to whom I was not
married.
 
In June 2003 I recklessly threatened SM by
word or conduct on more than one occasion for
 the same purpose.
 
In fact, Rosete wanted the jury to know that it was Olione who
 
was convicted of sex assault, lest the jury believe that the
 incident involved Rosete. Rosete did not request a limiting
 instruction at the time of the stipulation, and the record does
 not reflect that he requested a limiting instruction as part of
 the jury’s final charge. 
When Yoshimoto’s testimony resumed, Plaintiff’s counsel
 
questioned him about the destruction of ward complaints; YCO-on­ward verbal, physical, and sexual abuse; and Costales’ own
 grievances about being beaten by another YCO (not Rosete) and
 being placed in isolation with insufficient food and sleep time.
 Yoshimoto alternately denied the incidents happened, denied
 knowledge or recollection of these incidents, disclaimed
 responsibility for those incidents that occurred while sub­
12
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
contractors ran the HYCF school, justified the incidents as
 
reasonable use of force, or asserted that verbal abuse at HYCF
 was too pervasive to reduce or eliminate. Rosete did not request
 a limiting instruction at the time of Yoshimoto’s testimony, and
 the record does not reflect that he requested a limiting
 instruction as part of the jury’s final charge. 
7. Testimony of Scott Rosete
 
Costales also called Rosete, then a YCO supervisor on paid
 
leave from HYCF, to testify. His testimony regarding the time
 period of the alleged sexual assaults follows:
 
Q [by Costales’ counsel]:  Did you ever take [Costales] out
 
of her dorm at night?
A [by Rosete]:  I’m sure I did.
 Q: Did you ever take any other girls out of their dorms at
night?
A: Yes, I have.
 Q: And, during those times did you allow them to punch the
clock?
 
A: No, ma’am.
 
Q: During the nights when you took [Costales] out of her
room, you allowed her to watch TV, right?
A: My answer would be yes, but, I would have to explain
myself though.  When we take them out, the T.V.’s already on
because that’s what we’re doing, we’re watching TV.  And, -­and, we’d be taking out wards for numerous reasons.  If they
come out –- out of the dorm, they’re in the living room area
where the T.V’s at I’m sure that they would be watching.
Q: And, you do this during the time when they’re supposed
to be locked up and in their dorm and sleeping, right?
A: Yes, ma’am.
 Q: And, you would give her candies and cigarettes during
these nights; isn’t that correct?
A: That’s not true.
 Q: And you would make her massage your feet during these
nights; is that correct?
A: That is not correct.
 Q: And, did you not talk dirty to her during these nights?
 A: That is absolutely not true.
 Q: Did you not tell her that she was sexy?
 A: No.
 Q: Did you ever –- did you not tell her that you wanted to
fuck her brains out.
 A: I did not.
 
13
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Q: And, did you not touch her in a sexual way?
 
A: No, ma’am.
 Q: Did you sexually assault[] Stacey Costales with your
fingers?
A: No.
 Q: Did you sexually assault[] her with your penis?
 A: Negative.
 
8. Testimony of Stacey Costales
 
Costales also took the stand. She testified that wards
 
feared Rosete because he had physically abused her and other
 
wards. She testified that she and other wards did not report the
 physical abuse because nothing would have been done about it. 
She testified that Rosete would boast that all he would get was a
 “slap on the wrist” if any of the wards reported his behavior. 
Costales also testified that Rosete called the wards “bitches”
 and “sluts.” He would often humiliate the wards by making them
 wear “I’m stupid” signs and by making them bark like dogs for
 their food.
 
She testified that she began to trust Rosete after he
 
started counseling her and taking her out of her dorm at night to
 give her candy, Zippy’s food, and cigarettes. She testified that
 she punched the time clock for Rosete, massaged his feet, made
 toast for him, and grabbed mattresses from the isolation rooms
 for him. She testified that after Rosete befriended her, he
 “started doing things to [her],” including touching her breasts
 and vagina twice, before having sexual intercourse with her. He
 also told Costales she was “sexy” and that he “want[ed] to fuck
 
14
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
[her] brains out.” She elaborated that the night Rosete had sex
 
with her, he had asked her to bring him a mattress from an
 isolation room; when Costales was in the isolation room, Rosete
 followed her and pushed her onto the mattress, “got on top of
 [her], pulled [her] clothes off and put himself inside of [her].” 
He stopped because he heard something and went to check it out. 
9. Testimony of Susan Thain
 
Portions of the deposition testimony of retired HYCF teacher
 
Susan Thain were read to the jury after Thain was declared
 unavailable. Thain testified that she was not aware that
 Costales was sexually assaulted, but she testified that she knew
 two other wards were raped. She testified that other YCOs were
 having what she surmised to be a sexual relationship with another
 ward, based on the ward’s statements to her. That same ward was
 also talked into stripping down by another YCO, who told her he
 wanted to use her as a clothing model. Thain testified that, in
 general the YCOs would often “swat [a] girl on the butt” or make
 passing comments she considered inappropriate. 
Thain testified that she witnessed YCOs physically beating
 
the wards, once to the point where a ward became unconscious. 
She testified that when she reported the abuse, the YCOs would
 harass and threaten her, and she believed her car was vandalized
 by one of them. 
15
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
C. 	Jury Instructions, Special Verdict Form, Findings of
Fact and Conclusions of Law, and Final Judgment
 
Relevant to this appeal, the only instruction on the
 
difference between official and individual capacity was the
 
following:
 
If a State employee is found liable in his official
capacity, then the State is responsible.
If a State employee is found liable in his individual
capacity, then that State employee is personally
responsible.
 
Also relevant to this appeal, the circuit court charged the jury
 
with the following instructions concerning separating each
 defendant’s rights:
 
Similarly, each defendant in this case has separate
and distinct rights.  You must decide the case of each
 
defendant separately, as if it were a separate lawsuit.
  
Unless I tell you otherwise, these instructions apply to all
the defendants.

TOTAL (Note: The total must equal 100%) 100%
 
QUESTION No. [14] – (Punitive Damages)
 
What is the total amount of any punitive damages that
Plaintiff Stacey Costales should receive from each
Defendant?
 
Scott Rosete $300,000
Melvin Ando $_______
 Glenn Yoshimoto $_______
 TOTAL $300,000
 
The jury’s answers closely tracked Costales’ request for damages
 
in her closing argument: “For Mr. Rosete, we’re asking $600,000. 
$300,000 for compensation, $300,000 for punitive damages. . . .
 The State? $300,000. Mr. Ando? $300,000. Mr. Yoshimoto? 
Same. Because they’re equally responsible. . . . And for future
 care and psychotherapy, $67,000. This is the total of one
 million five sixty-seven.”   In closing, Costales also asserted
 
that 75% of her depression resulted from Rosete’s sexual assault. 
The circuit court filed its Findings of Fact and Conclusions
 
19
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
of Law, which adopted the jury’s special verdict findings as to
 
Rosete, in his individual capacity, and adopted the advisory
 jury’s special verdict findings as to the remaining defendants. 
The circuit court entered final judgment as follows:
 
With respect to Claim I of Plaintiff’s Complaint,
relating to Plaintiff’s claim of assault and battery against
Defendant Scott Rosete, Judgment is hereby entered in favor
of Plaintiff Stacey Costales and against Defendant Scott
Rosete.
 
With respect to Claim II of Plaintiff’s Complaint,
relating to Plaintiff’s claim of negligence, Judgment is
hereby entered in favor of Plaintiff Stacey Costales and
against Defendants State of Hawaii, Office of Youth
Services, Department of Human Services, Melvin Ando and
Glenn Yoshimoto.
 
With respect to Claim III of Plaintiff’s Complaint,
relating to Plaintiff’s claim of intentional and negligent
infliction of emotional distress, Judgment is hereby entered
in favor of Plaintiff Stacey Costales and against Defendants
Scott Rosete, State of Hawaii, Office of Youth Services,
Department of Human Services, Melvin Ando and Glenn
Yoshimoto.
 
With respect to Claim IV of Plaintiff’s Complaint,
relating to Plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages, Judgment
is hereby entered in favor of Plaintiff Stacey Costales and
against Defendant Scott Rosete in the amount of $300,000.00.
Without regard to any apportionment, Plaintiff
Stacey[] Costales’ special damages are $67,000 and her
general damages are $1,150,000.00.
Without regard to any apportionment, Plaintiff’s total
special, general and punitive damages are $1,517,000,000. 
[sic]
 
Applying the 25% apportionment for Plaintiff’s
subsequent injury/condition, Plaintiff Stacey Costales’
combined special and general damages are $912,750.00.
Pursuant to the Court’s February 9, 2010 Order
Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiff’s Motion for
Taxation of Costs and Pre-Judgment Interest, Plaintiff
Stacey Costales is entitled to costs in the amount of
$12,438.27 against Defendants, except $1,993.19 of which is
not taxable against Defendant Scott Rosete in his individual
capacity; Plaintiff is not entitled to pre-judgment
interest.
 
Judgment in Plaintiff Stacey Costales’ favor, and
against all Defendants, is hereby entered in the total
amount of $1,225,188.27.
All remaining parties or issues to this case are
dismissed.

D. Post-Trial Motions4
 
Rosete moved for judgment as a matter of law or,
 
alternatively, for a new trial. Rosete argued that the “torrent
 
of evidence . . . with regard to alleged abuses by others” at
 HYCF should have been excluded as to Rosete as more prejudicial
 than probative. Rosete also argued that the special verdict form
 was inconsistent and confusing. Rosete then argued that Costales
 could not take judgment against both Rosete and the State, citing
 HRS § 662-10, which states, “The judgment in an action under this
 chapter shall constitute a complete bar to any action by the
 claimant, by reason of the same subject matter, against the
 employee of the State whose act or omission gave rise to the
 claim.” 
The circuit court issued its Order Granting in Part and
 
Denying in Part Defendant Rosete’s, in his Individual Capacity,
 Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law and Alternative Motion for
 a New Trial. The motion was granted as to Rosete’s request for a
 new trial and denied as to his motion for judgment as a matter of
 law. The only basis for the new trial was the irreconcilable
 conflict in the jury’s answers to special verdict question
 numbers 10 and 12: “The court finds that an irreconcilable
 
Effective January 28, 2010, Judge Marks’ previously assigned civil cases
 
were transferred and reassigned to Judge Rhonda Nishimura.  Judge Marks
presided over the trial in this case; Judge Nishimura presided over the bulk
of the post-trial motions in this case.
 
21

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
conflict exists between the jury’s answers in the percentage
 
allocation of fault amongst the defendants and the monetary
 damages allocated amongst the defendants.” 
Costales moved for reconsideration of the circuit court’s
 
order. 
Costales included as “new evidence” declarations from
 
nine jurors5
 stating that they intended to award Costales the
dollar amounts assigned to all defendants in question number 12
 of the special verdict and that the percentages of fault
 allocated in question number 10 did not control. Alternatively,
 Costales argued that if a new trial were unavoidable, the issues
 upon re-trial should be limited to the allocation of general
 damages among the defendants, as the defendants did not dispute
 that they were 100% at fault and that the total damages were
 $1,150,000.00. The circuit court denied Costales’ motion for
 reconsideration.

E. ICA Appeal
 
This appeal reached the ICA on the circuit court’s order
 
granting Costales’ Motion for Interlocutory Appeal of the order
 granting Rosete, in his individual capacity, a new trial, and the
 order denying her motion for reconsideration of that order. 
5 Costales later filed similar declarations from two more jurors. 
6 The trial court left it to the appellate courts to consider the juror 
declarations.  The ICA concluded (and we agree) that the juror declarations
concerned the jurors’ intent; therefore, the circuit court properly declinedto consider the declarations because they were barred under HRE Rule 606. Costales, mem. op. at 17-18. 
22
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Rosete, in his individual capacity, filed a cross-appeal,
 
raising as points of error the circuit court’s admission of the
 
other defendants’ bad acts, the circuit court’s failure to grant
 Rosete a new trial on the additional basis of prejudice from
 these bad acts, and HRS § 662-10’s judgment bar. 
In Costales’ answering brief, she counter-argued, “The Trial 
Court was correct in admitting evidence of prior physical and sexual abuse of other HYCF wards by Defendants Rosete and other guards to show notice of a dangerous condition and opportunity.” Costales also argued that Rosete was not prejudiced by the admission of the other defendants’ bad acts because the evidence was overwhelming that Rosete sexually assaulted Costales. Further, she argued that Rosete waived his argument for failing to move for limiting instructions as to this evidence at trial. Lastly, as to Rosete’s HRS § 662-10 argument, Costales counter-
argued that there is no Hawai‘ i case law interpreting the 
statute, but she cited Breed v. Shaner, 57 Haw. 656, 665, 562 P.2d 436, 442 (1977), for the general proposition that Hawai‘ i’s 
STLA should be liberally construed to compensate victims for the 
negligent conduct of State employees. 
The ICA issued a Memorandum Opinion, remanding this case
 
“for a new trial limited to the allocation of fault and damages
 among the defendants.” Costales, mem. op. at 21. The ICA
 
concluded that the evidence of the other defendants’ bad acts was
 
23
   
 
  
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
admissible to show notice. Costales, mem. op. at 12. Further,
 
the ICA concluded that Olione’s deposition testimony concerning
 
his sexual assault of another ward was admissible once Yoshimoto
 opened the door. Costales, mem. op. at 13. Moreover, the ICA
 
concluded that all of this evidence was not unfairly prejudicial
 to Rosete because the circuit court instructed the jury to
 consider evidence against each defendant separately. Costales,
 
mem. op. at 13.
 
The ICA also rejected Rosete’s argument that HRS § 662-10
 
precluded judgment against both him and the State. Costales,
 
mem. op. at 15. It concluded, “Plainly read, the statute
 precludes subsequent claims on the same subject matter, but does
 not bar claims against multiple defendants.” Costales, mem. op.
 
at 15 (citing Rodriguez v. Handy, 873 F.2d 814, 816 n.1 (5th Cir.
 1989)).
 
The single issue in which the ICA concluded that the circuit
 
court erred was in ordering a new trial without a limitation on
 issues, because the defendants did not dispute that their
 combined fault was 100%, nor did they argue that the damage award
 was unreasonable. Costales, mem. op. at 18. The ICA concluded,
 
“The circuit court ignored the supreme court’s conclusion in Dias
 [v. Vanek, 67 Haw. 114, 118, 679 P.2d 133, 136 (1984)] that the
 preferred remedy for such a verdict is a new trial limited to the
 issue of damages.” Costales, mem. op. at 20 (emphasis in
 
24
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
original).   The ICA then remanded the case for a new trial
 
“limited to the allocation of fault and damages among the
 
defendants.” Costales , mem. op. at 21.
 
III. Standards of Review
 
A. Motion for New Trial
 
Both the grant and the denial of a motion for new trial
[are] within the trial court’s discretion, and we will not
reverse that decision absent a clear abuse of discretion. 
An abuse of discretion occurs “where the trial court has
 clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules
or principles of law or practice to the substantial
detriment of a party litigant.”
 
State by Bronster v. U. S. Steel Corp. , 82 Hawai‘ i 32, 54, 919 
P.2d 294, 316 (1996) (citations omitted). It is also within the
 
appellate court’s discretion to limit the issues of a new trial
 
upon remand. Miyamoto v. Lum, 104 Hawai‘ i 1, 10, 84 P.3d 509, 
518 (2004).
 
B. Evidentiary Rulings
 
[D]ifferent standards of review must be applied to trial
court decisions regarding the admissibility of evidence,
depending on the requirements of the particular rule of
evidence at issue.  When application of a particular
evidentiary rule can yield only one correct result, the
proper standard for appellate review is the right/wrong
standard.  Where the evidentiary ruling at issue concerns
admissibility based upon relevance, under [Hawai �i Rules of 
Evidence (HRE)] Rules 401 and 402, the proper standard of
appellate review is the right/wrong standard. . . . Evidentiary decisions based on HRE Rule 403, which require a“judgment call” on the part of the trial court, are reviewedfor an abuse of discretion. 
Tabieros v. Clark Equip. Co., 85 Hawai� i 336, 350-51, 944 P.2d 
1279, 1293-94 (1997).
 
25
  
 
  7 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
C. Statutory Construction
 
Interpretation of a statute is a question of law, which this
 
court reviews de novo. See Molinar v. Schweizer, 95 Hawai‘ i 331, 
334-35, 22 P.3d 978, 981-82 (2001) (citation omitted). 
IV. Discussion
 
As a preliminary matter, the circuit court and ICA properly
 
concluded that the special verdict form was defective. It is
 
true that the trial court has “‘complete discretion’ over the
 
type of verdict form” to use. Montalvo v. Lapez , 77 Hawai‘ i 282, 
292, 884 P.2d 345, 355 (1994) (citations omitted). “When . . .
 
the trial court ‘require[s] a jury to return only a special
 verdict in the form of a special written finding upon each issue
 of fact,’ HRCP 49(a)[ 
7
] compels the judge to ‘give to the jury
such explanation and instruction concerning the matter thus
 
Hawai ‘i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 49(a) (2009) provides: 
Special verdicts.   The court may require a jury to return
only a special verdict in the form of a special written
finding upon each issue of fact.  In that event the court may submit to the jury written questions susceptible ofcategorical or other brief answer or may submit writtenforms of the several special findings which might properlybe made under the pleadings and evidence; or it may usesuch other method of submitting the issues and requiring thewritten findings thereon as it deems most appropriate. The court shall give to the jury such explanation andinstruction concerning the matter thus submitted as may benecessary to enable the jury to make its findings upon eachissue.  If in so doing the court omits any issue of factraised by the pleadings or by the evidence, each partywaives the right to a trial by jury of the issue so omittedunless before the jury retires the party demands itssubmission to the jury.  As to an issue omitted without such demand the court may make a finding; or, if it fails to doso, it shall be deemed to have made a finding in accord with
the judgment on the special verdict. 
26
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
submitted as may be necessary to enable the jury to make its 
findings upon each issue.’” Knodle v. Waikiki Gateway Hotel, 69 
Haw. 376, 383, 742 P.2d 377, 382 (1987) (footnote modified). The questions on the special verdict form, however, “may be so defective that they constitute reversible error. In analyzing alleged errors in special verdict forms, the instructions and the interrogatories on the verdict form are considered as a whole.” 
Montalvo, 77 Hawai‘ i at 292, 884 P.2d at 355 (citations omitted). 
In this case, the special verdict form and its accompanying
 
jury instructions were defective. The jury instructions did not
 
inform the jury as to the circumstances under which Rosete,
 Yoshimoto, and Ando would be liable in their individual versus
 official capacities for the general damage amounts the jury
 assigned in special verdict question number 12. Ordinarily, a
 public official is qualifiedly immune from liability. Medeiros
 
v. Kondo, 55 Haw. 499, 505, 522 P.2d 1269, 1272 (1974). To
 defeat a public official’s claim of qualified immunity, the
 burden is on the plaintiff to adduce “clear and convincing proof
 that [the public official] defendant was motivated by malice and
 not by an otherwise proper purpose.” Id. “If it is determined
 
that [the individual defendant] was acting within the scope of
 his employment as a public official, then he can be held liable
 for general, special, and punitive damages (1) if he maliciously
 exercised his official discretion, or (2) if he maliciously
 
27
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
committed a tort against plaintiffs. . . .” Kajiya v. Dep’t of
 
Water Supply, 2 Haw. App. 221, 227, 629 P.2d 635, 640 (App. 1981)
 
(citations and footnote omitted). 
“Unless the issue is removed from the case by uncontested
 
affidavits and depositions, the existence or absence of malice is
 a question for the jury.” Kajiya, 2 Haw. App. at 227, 629 P.2d
 
at 640. In this case, there was no jury instruction on malice or
 improper purpose; therefore, when the jury assigned damage
 amounts to Rosete, Ando, and Yoshimoto in their individual and
 official capacities in special verdict question number 12, it was
 not informed that Costales had to meet a higher burden of proof
 in order to hold the individual defendants personally liable for
 her damages. 
Second, the jury’s answers to special verdict question
 
numbers 10 and 12 were irreconcilably in conflict. “A conflict
 in the answers to questions in a special verdict does not
 automatically warrant a new trial; a new trial will be ordered
 only if the conflict is irreconcilable.” Kalilikane v. McCravey,
 
69 Haw. 145, 152, 737 P.2d 862, 867 (1987) (citation omitted). 
Although the ICA has previously cited to Texas authority for the
 proposition that an irreconcilable conflict in a special verdict
 form exists when “one of the answers would require a judgment in
 favor of the plaintiff and the other would require a judgment in
 favor of the defendant . . . necessarily requir[ing] the entry of
 
28
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
a judgment different from that which the court has entered,” we 
have also found an irreconcilable conflict in situations where there was no question that the judgment would be for the 
plaintiff. Compare Dunbar v. Thompson, 79 Hawai‘ i 306, 312-13, 
901 P.2d 1285, 1291-92 (App. 1995) (citing Vieau v. City & County 
of Honolulu, 3 Haw. App. 492, 499, 653 P.2d 1161, 1166 (1982) (citing Little Rock Furniture Mfg. Co. v. Dunn, 148 Tex, 197, 206, 222 S.W.2d 985, 991 (1949))) with Ray v. Kapiolani Med. 
Specialists, 125 Hawai‘ i 253, 261-62, 259 P.3d 569, 577-78 (2011) 
(observing that the jury’s answers to the special verdict form 
were irreconcilably in conflict based on the facts of the case, where the jury found that a doctor’s treatment of a plaintiff did not cause injury but found that the doctor’s failure to properly inform the plaintiff did). 
In this case, the special verdict form called upon the jury
 
to assign damages in two ways: special verdict question number
 10 asked the jury to assign percentages of fault for Costales’
 injury among all the defendants, while special verdict question
 number 12 asked the jury to break down general damages owed to
 Costales by the State and by Rosete, Ando, and Yoshimoto. The
 jury answered question number 12 in a manner mathematically
 inconsistent with their answer to question number 10. The
 answers to these questions were irreconcilably in conflict. Like
 Ray, even though the judgment for plaintiff is not at issue, the
 
29
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
jury’s answers to special verdict question numbers 10 and 12 are
 
irreconcilably in conflict because it is unclear what amount of
 general and special damages Rosete, Ando, and Yoshimoto owe to
 Costales, and in what capacity (individual or official). 
Therefore, a new trial is warranted. 
The next section discusses the issues to be determined upon
 
re-trial.
 
A. 	New Trial Limited to the Allocation of Fault and 
Damages among the Defendants
On certiorari, Rosete argues that the ICA erred in ordering
 
an entirely new trial limited to the allocation of fault and
 
damages among the defendants. Further, he argues in conclusory
 fashion that “[t]he concept of seating a new jury merely to
 
reallocate a prior jury’s dueling verdicts is unprecedented and
 
denies either the state an advisory jury or Mr. Rosete an actual
 jury verdict.” In any event, he argues the new jury would have
 to hear all the evidence, making the ICA’s remand impractical.
 Rosete makes plain that the primary reason he seeks a new trial
 is to exclude evidence heard in the first trial that he argues
 was unfairly prejudicial to him, an issue that is discussed in
 the next subsection. 
 
In Costales’ Response, she counter-argues (1) limiting re­
trial to the “allocation of damages” is the preferred remedy
 under 
Dias, 67 Haw. 114, 679 P.2d 133; (2) such a limitation
 
30
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
promotes judicial economy and fairness, particularly in light of
 
the fact that the defendants do not contest that they were 100%
 liable for Costales’ injury or that the total damages awarded
 were reasonable; (3) the limited re-trial is a practical solution
 and will not require recalling many of the liability and damages
 witnesses; and (4) Rosete’s request for a completely new trial is
 a thinly veiled attempt at a “second bite of the apple.” 
The ICA’s remand of this case for a re-trial “limited to the
 
allocation of fault and damages” is problematic. Costales, mem.
 
op. at 21. The ICA cited Dias for the proposition that “the
 preferred remedy for [an irreconcilable conflict in a special
 verdict form] is a new trial limited to the issue of damages.” 
Costales, mem. op. at 20 (emphasis in original). Dias, however,
 
does not squarely address the situation in this case: an
 uncontested total damage award where the allocation of fault, in
 addition to damages, among the defendants is ambiguous. 
In Dias, homebuyers (the Diases) sued homesellers (the
 
Vaneks) for fraud, after the Vaneks previously represented that
 their termite inspector found no evidence of termites in the
 home, and after the Diases found termites in one of the walls. 
67 Haw. at 115-16, 679 P.2d at 134-35. The Diases stopped making
 monthly payments to the Vaneks under their agreement of sale, and
 the Vaneks made a counterclaim against the Diases for breach of
 the agreement of sale. 67 Haw. at 116, 679 P.2d at 135. 
31
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The jury found, inter alia, that the Diases breached the
 
agreement of sale and were liable to the Vaneks for $6,263. Id. 
The trial court, without explanation, allowed the Vaneks to keep
 
the down payment on the agreement of sale and ordered the Diases
 to pay the $6,263 in damages to the Vaneks in addition to that. 
Id. The Diases appealed. Id. 
This court acknowledged that Hawai‘ i law allowed the seller 
to retain payments made as liquidated damages. 67 Haw. at 116­17, 679 P.2d at 135. However, this court observed that the trial court’s instruction to the jury regarding the down payment mentioned only that a rescission of the agreement of sale (which the jury did not find was warranted) would allow the Diases to get their down payment back; the instructions made no mention of what would happen to the down payment if the Diases did not succeed in rescinding the agreement of sale. 67 Haw. at 117, 679 P.2d at 135-36. Thus, it was unclear what the jury understood would happen to the down payment, and it was unclear whether the jury’s award of $2,263 accounted for the down payment or not. 67 Haw. at 118, 679 P.2d at 136. Thus, this court held that the trial court erred in awarding the down payment to the Vaneks, further clarifying, “The preferred remedy of an ambiguous verdict is to have the jurors return to clarify the verdict. Here, the jury had been discharged, and the only available remedy is a remand for a new trial limited to the issue of damages[.]” Id. 
32
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
This case is similar to Dias in some respects but not
 
others. The jury’s special verdict, like the verdict in Dias,
 
was unclear, because the percentage fault in question number 10
 was mathematically inconsistent with the damages breakdown in
 question number 12. Further, like Dias, the jury in this case
 had already been discharged and could not be called in to clarify
 the verdict. 
However, all the Dias remedy speaks to is re-trial on the
 
contested issue of damages. In this case, the total amount of
 damages is uncontested.
8 At no point did Rosete (or the other
 
defendants) argue that the jury award was unreasonable or that
 the defendants were not collectively 100% liable to the
 Plaintiff. Rather, Rosete argued that the confusion in the
 jury’s special verdict pertained to whether the percentages of
 fault in question number 10 control, or whether the damages
 breakdown in question number 12 controls. As such, Dias’s remedy
 of a new trial limited to damages does not squarely address the
 ambiguity in the special verdict at bar. 
Further, not all of the damages determinations are
 
contested. Therefore, the Dias remedy, as applied to this case
 on remand, is not properly limited. We therefore further limit
 the damages issues to be re-tried to those that are contested and
 
No party disputes the jury’s answers to special verdict question numbers
 
1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, which establish that each defendant’s actions or
omissions were the legal cause of Costales’ injuries.  
33
 8 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
that are “sufficiently separate” from those damages issues that 
are not contested on appeal. See Miyamoto, 104 Hawai‘ i at 10, 84 
P.3d at 518 (inferring that where trial issues are “sufficiently 
separate,” a re-trial on remand can be limited to certain issues). Not at issue on re-trial are the following determinations. First, the jury’s answer to question number 14 established that Rosete is liable to Costales for $300,000 in punitive damages; there is no question that Rosete is liable in his individual capacity for punitive damages. See HRS § 662-2 
(1993) (“The State hereby waives its immunity for liability for the torts of its employees . . . but shall not be liable for . . . punitive damages.”) Second, the jury’s answer to question number 13 established that 25% of Costales’ damages can be apportioned to an injury or condition that arose subsequent to the 2002 sexual assaults; no party disputes this determination. These damage determinations shall not be re-tried upon remand. Therefore, we affirm the circuit court’s Final Judgment to the extent that it awarded Costales $300,000 in punitive damages from Rosete, in his individual capacity. 
In this case, due to the irreconcilable conflict in the
 
jury’s answers to special verdict question numbers 10 and 12, and
 due to the absence of a Medeiros jury instruction, re-trial on
 remand shall be limited to the allocation of liability and of
 general and special damages among the defendants, with an
 
34
    
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
instruction to be given to the jury regarding when a State
 
employee can be personally liable due to malice or improper
 purpose. In other words, the re-trial shall be limited to a
 redetermination of the allocation of fault and damages under
 special verdict form question numbers 10, 11, and 12.
 
B. Admission of the Other Defendants’ Bad Acts
 
On certiorari, Rosete argues that he is entitled to an
 
entirely new trial, not limited to the issue of allocation of
 fault and damages, because he was unfairly prejudiced by the 
admission of the other defendants’ bad acts. Although he
 concedes that the bad act evidence was admissible to show notice
 of a dangerous condition relevant to Costales’ negligence claims
 against the State, he argues that the jury found him “guilty by
 association” with the other defendants, as evidenced by the 
illogical division of damages between the accused rapist and
negligent co-defendants.  By definition, an intentional
tortfeasor causes more damage than those whose negligence
contributed to the harm . . . but that was not the finding
of this confused and angry jury,
 
who attributed 18% of the damage to Rosete and 82% of the damage
 
to the other defendants.9 Rosete argues that the torrent of bad
 
act evidence attributable to the other defendants roused the jury
 to overmastering hostility towards them, thereby distracting the
 jury from the question of whether Rosete committed the sexual
 assault against Costales. 
This argument is disingenuous for Rosete to make; it should be in his
 
interest to accept an 18% allocation of fault and not advocate that the jury
should have found him more at fault.
 
35
 9  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
In Costales’ Response, she argues that Rosete’s argument
 
that he was prejudiced by the admission of the other defendants’
 
bad acts is oversimplified; she argued that testimony simply
 adverse to Rosete is not prejudicial. Further, she argued that
 Rosete could have (1) asked for his trial to be bifurcated from
 the other defendants but did not; and (2) asked for a limiting
 instruction but did not. Moreover, she argued that the circuit
 court instructed the jury that “each defendant in this case has
 separate and distinct rights. You must decide the case of each
 defendant separately, as if it were a separate lawsuit.” She
 argued that the jury was presumed to follow the court’s
 instructions. 
The ICA’s disposition of the issue was proper. The record
 
does not reflect that Rosete ever requested a limiting
 instruction as to evidence of the other defendants’ bad acts,
 even after it became clear that the circuit court was admitting
 the evidence as relevant to the issue of their notice of a
 dangerous condition. HRE Rule 105 states, “When evidence which
 is admissible as to one party or for one purpose but not
 admissible as to another party or for another purpose is
 admitted, the court, upon request, shall restrict the evidence to
 its proper scope and instruct the jury accordingly.” Further,
 the parties acknowledged that Yoshimoto opened the door regarding
 YCO Lia Olione’s conviction for sexual assault and stipulated to
 
36
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the fact of conviction. In fact, Rosete wanted the jury to know
 
that it was Olione –- not Rosete -- who was convicted of sex
 assault. 
Moreover, even considering the allegedly adverse impact of
 
this evidence upon Rosete’s defense, it is unlikely that the jury
 was distracted by it in assessing whether Rosete sexually
 assaulted Costales, because there was a similar “torrent” of
 graphic testimony on that issue by Costales and her witnesses,
 rebutted only by Rosete’s bare assertions that he did not
 sexually assault Costales. With or without the admission of the
 bad acts of the other defendants, the jury would likely have
 found Rosete liable for sexually assaulting Costales.
 Consequently, on certiorari, Rosete has not shown how the
 admission of bad acts going towards the issue of the other
 defendants’ negligence prejudiced him.
 
C. HRS § 662-10
 
Rosete argues that HRS § 662-10 precludes a contemporaneous 
judgment against both the State of Hawai‘ i and Rosete in his 
individual capacity. It is true that HRS § 662-10 states, “The judgment in an action under this chapter shall constitute a complete bar to any action by the claimant, by reason of the same subject matter, against the employee of the State whose act or omission gave rise to the claim.” However, the provisions of Chapter 662, including HRS § 662-10’s judgment bar, does not 
37
  10 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
apply to Costales’ claim of assault and battery against Rosete in
 
his individual capacity. HRS § 662-15 (Supp. 2004) states, “This
 chapter [Chapter 662] shall not apply to . . . [a]ny claim
 arising out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false
 arrest, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander,
 misrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract rights.
 . . .” Therefore, HRS § 662-10 does not apply to bar Costales’
 intentional tort claim against Rosete in his individual
 capacity.
10
   
In rejecting Rosete’s argument, the ICA misused federal case law
 
interpreting 28 U.S.C. § 2676 (2006).  Costales, mem. op. at 15.  The ICA took
 
a footnote from Rodriguez , 873 F.2d at 816 n.1, out of context to support its
conclusion that 28 U.S.C. § 2676 (and, analogously, HRS § 662-10) bars only
the subsequent judgment against an individual government employee following a
judgment against the government.  The complete footnote in Rodriguez reads:
The plaintiffs contend that § 2676 is an affirmative defense
which the individual defendants waived by failing to
affirmatively plead it.  The flaw in this argument is that §
2676 is applicable only after a plaintiff obtains a judgment
against the United States . In this case the judgment
against the United States was entered at the same time as
the judgment against the individual.  Therefore, the
individual defendants could not have plead § 2676 as an
affirmative defense.
 
873 F.2d at 816, n.1 (emphasis added).  The point in the Rodriguez footnote
was that 28 U.S.C. § 2676 does not bar a Bivens claim against an individual
government defendant from the outset, even though the Bivens  claim accompanies
a Federal Tort Claims Act (“FTCA”) claim, and even if the Bivens claim might
later be precluded by a judgment on the FTCA claim.  (A “Bivens claim” refers
 to the  private right of action for money damages based on constitutional
violations committed by federal agents in the performance of their official
duties, which was judicially created by Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of
Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971).)
The ICA, however, characterized the emphasized language above as the
“holding” in Rodriguez, ignoring the rest of the opinion, which held that a
even contemporaneous entry of judgment on an FTCA claim bars the entry of
judgment on a Bivens  claim, under 28 U.S.C. § 2676.  Rodriguez, 873 F.2d at
 
816: 
[T]he price of obtaining an FTCA judgment against the United
States based on a given incident is the loss of all claims
arising from that incident against the United States’
agents:  “The moment judgment was entered against the
government, then by virtue of section 2676, [the individual
(continued . . .)

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
In a case factually similar to the instant one, we held:
 
[W]here the plaintiff’s negligence claim seeks to hold the
State liable for the conduct of state employees other than
the alleged tortfeasor, pursuant to theories of negligent
hiring, retention, supervision, or the like, the plaintiff’s
claim does not necessarily “arise out of” the hired,
retained, or supervised employee’s intentional tort. 
Rather, if the State knew, or reasonably should have
anticipated, that one of its employees would commit an
intentional tort against a person to whom the State owed a
duty of care, the State is liable for the negligence of
those employees who were in a position to take reasonable
precautions against the anticipated harm .
 
Doe Parents No. 1 v. Dep’t of Educ. , 100 Hawai‘ i 34, 68, 58 P.3d 
545, 579 (2002) (emphasis added). Therefore, HRS § 662-10 does
 
not bar Costales from obtaining contemporaneous judgments from
 Rosete in his individual capacity and from the State. To the
 extent that recovery against the State is predicated on the
 alleged negligence of Rosete’s superiors in hiring, supervising,
 training, and retaining him, such a claim does not involve “the
 same subject matter” as the intentional tort claims against
 Rosete. 
V. Conclusion
 
For the foregoing reasons, the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal is
 
vacated. 
The circuit court’s Order Granting in Part and Denying
 
in Part Defendant Rosete’s, in his Individual Capacity, Motion
 for Judgment as a Matter of Law and Alternative Motion for a New
 Trial is affirmed, and this case is remanded for further

proceedings consistent with this opinion. Specifically, the
 
circuit court shall limit the issues of the new trial to the
 allocation of fault and of general and special damages among the
 defendants, with an instruction to be given to the jury regarding
 when a State employee can be personally liable due to malice or
 improper purpose pursuant to Medeiros v. Kondo, 55 Haw. 499, 505,
 522 P.2d 1269, 1272 (1974). In other words, the re-trial shall

 damages under special verdict form question numbers 10, 11, and
