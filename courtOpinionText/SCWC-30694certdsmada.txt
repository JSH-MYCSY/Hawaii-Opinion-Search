ORDER DISMISSING APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI
 
(By:   Recktenwald,  C.J.,  Nakayama,  Acoba,  McKenna,  and  Pollack,  JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that: (1) prior
 
to the issuance of the judgment on appeal, Plaintiffs/Appellees/
 
Petitioners-Appellants Tommy Wai Hung Ma and Sindy Yee Ma
 (Petitioners) filed an Application for Writ of Certiorari to the
 Hawai'i Supreme Court or Alternatively for Transfer (Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 40.1, 40.2) challenging the
 
denial of attorneys’ fees; (2) after the issuance of the judgment
 on appeal, Petitioners requested, and the appellate clerk
 entered, a thirty-day extension of time to file an application
 for a writ of certiorari; (3) Petitioners should raise all issues
 related to this case, including the denial of attorneys’ fees, in
 a single application for writ of certiorari; and (4) the
 application for transfer is untimely. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Application for Writ of 
Certiorari to the Hawai' i Supreme Court or Alternatively for 
Transfer (HRAP Rule 40.1, 40.2) is dismissed. This dismissal is without prejudice to Petitioners filing, within the time provided by the June 17, 2013 clerk’s extension, an application for a writ of certiorari, which may include the points presented in the dismissed application. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, July 12, 2013.
