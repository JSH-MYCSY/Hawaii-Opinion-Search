CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS

SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Acoba, and McKenna, JJ.,
with Circuit Judge Ayabe, assigned by reason of vacancy,
concurring in the result;
with Recktenwald, C.J., dissenting, with whom Nakayama, J. joins)
 
Petitioner Brandy Iwalani C. Avilla (“Avilla”) seeks
 
review of the Intermediate Court of Appeal’s April 24, 2012
 
Judgment on Appeal, entered pursuant to its April 9, 2012 Summary
Disposition Order, which affirmed the District Court of the First
Circuit’s “Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and
 Plea/Judgment” filed on June 9, 2010. The District Court
     ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
adjudged Avilla guilty of Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence 
of an Intoxicant, in violation of Hawai 'i Revised Statutes 
(“HRS”) § 291E-61(a)(1)(2007).1
 
We accepted Avilla’s application for writ of certiorari
 
and now vacate the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal and remand this case
 to the District Court with instructions to dismiss Avilla’s
 Complaint without prejudice.
 
On certiorari, Avilla contends that the ICA order 
affirming her conviction constitutes an obvious inconsistency with the Supreme Court’s April 12, 2012 decision in State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai
'i 48, 276 P.3d 617. In State v. Nesmith, we 
held that mens rea must be alleged in an HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) charge in order to provide fair notice of the nature and cause of the accusation. State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai
'i at 54-55, 276 P.3d 
at 623-24. The Complaint against Avilla failed to allege the mens rea required in an HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) charge. Therefore, Avilla’s HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) charge was deficient for failing to allege mens rea. 
Unlike Nesmith, however, Avilla challenged the
 
sufficiency of the Complaint for the first time on appeal. This
 
1
 HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) provided, at the time of the alleged offense,
the following:
 
A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle under
the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates or
assumes actual physical control of a vehicle . . . [w]hile
under the influence of alcohol in an amount sufficient to
 impair the person's normal mental faculties or ability to
care for the person and guard against casualty[.]
  ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
court recently issued a decision in which the sufficiency of a 
charge was similarly challenged for the first time on certiorari. See State v. Apollonio, 130 Hawai
'i 353, 311 P.3d 676. In State 
v. Apollonio, the majority of this court held, “a charge that
 fails to charge a requisite state of mind cannot be construed
 reasonably to state an offense and thus the charge is dismissed
 without prejudice because it violates due process.” Id. at 359,
 
311 P.3d at 682. Avilla’s Complaint failed to charge a requisite
 state of mind, and thus, the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal must be
 vacated and the charge must be dismissed without prejudice
 because it violates due process.
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal
 
is vacated, and this case is remanded to the District Court with
 instructions to dismiss the Complaint without prejudice.
