DISSENT BY RECKTENWALD, C.J.
 
I respectfully dissent. In my view, the terms of the 
Settlement Agreement are ambiguous, and thus, I would grant the
 
application to address the question of whether the Intermediate
 Court of Appeals gravely erred in failing to consider parol
 evidence. 
/s/ Mark E. Recktenwald
