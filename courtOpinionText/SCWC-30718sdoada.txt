review of the Intermediate Court of Appeal’s September 12, 2011

Intoxicant “OVUII,” in violation of Hawai' i Revised Statutes 
(“HRS”) § 291E-61(a)(1) and (a)(3).2 We accepted Yamahata’s
 
application for writ of certiorari and now affirm the ICA’s
 
Judgment on Appeal.
 
On certiorari, Yamahata contends that the ICA gravely
 
erred in holding that mens rea need not be alleged in either an
 HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) or an HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) charge. In State
 v. Nesmith, we recently held that (1) mens rea must be alleged in
 an HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) charge in order to provide fair notice of
 the nature and cause of the accusation; and (2) mens rea need not
 be alleged (or proven) in an HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) charge, as the
 
2	 HRS § 291E-61(a) provided, at the time of Yamahata’s offense:
 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating
a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the
 
person operates or assumes actual physical control of
a vehicle:
 
(1)	 While under the influence of alcohol in an
 amount sufficient to impair the person’s normal
mental faculties or ability to care for the
person and guard against casualty;
 
(2)	 While under the influence of any drug that
impairs the person’s ability to operate the
vehicle in a careful and prudent manner;
 
(3)	 With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two
hundred ten liters of breath; or
 
(4)	 With .08 or more grams of alcohol per one
hundred milliliters or cubic centimeters of
 blood.
 
HRS § 291E-61(a) (Supp. 2010).
 
2
            *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
legislative intent to impose absolute liability for an HRS § 
291E-61(a)(3) offense plainly appears. State v. Nesmith, ___ 
Hawai'i ___, ___ P.3d ___ (2012). Accordingly, the ICA gravely 
erred in holding that mens rea need not be alleged in an HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) charge. Therefore, Yamahata’s HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) charge was deficient for failing to allege mens rea. 
However, the District Court adjudged Yamahata guilty of 
violating both HRS §§ 291E-61(a)(1) and (a)(3). Subsections (a)(1) and (a)(3) can each serve as the basis for a conviction under HRS § 291E-61. See State v. Grindles, 70 Haw. 528, 530-31, 
777 P.2d 1187, 1189-90 (1989); State v. Caleb, 79 Hawai' i 336, 
339, 902 P.2d 971, 974 (1995); State v. Mezurashi, 77 Hawai' i 94, 
98, 881 P.2d 1240, 1244 (1994). Insofar as the HRS § 291E­61(a)(3) charge was sufficient, and insofar as Yamahata does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence as to that basis, his conviction still stands. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal
 
is affirmed.
