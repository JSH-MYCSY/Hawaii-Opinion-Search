ALEJANDRO PADILLA, Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant.
 
CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS

SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Duffy, and McKenna, JJ.;
with Acoba, J., concurring and dissenting)
 
Petitioner Alejandro Padilla (“Padilla”) seeks review
 
of the Intermediate Court of Appeal’s August 2, 2011 Judgment on
 
Appeal, entered pursuant to its June 29, 2011 Summary Disposition
 Order, which affirmed the District Court of the First Circuit’s
 July 21, 2010 Judgment and Notice. The District Court adjudged
 Padilla guilty of Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an
 
Intoxicant, in violation of Hawai' i Revised Statutes (“HRS”)  
 
    
 ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
§§ 291E-61(a)(1) and (a)(3)(2007).1 We accepted Padilla’s
 
application for writ of certiorari and now affirm the ICA’s
 
Judgment on Appeal.
 
On certiorari, Padilla contends that the ICA gravely
 
erred in holding that mens rea need not be alleged in either an
 HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) or an HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) charge. In State
 v. Nesmith, we recently held that (1) mens rea must be alleged in
 an HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) charge in order to provide fair notice of
 the nature and cause of the accusation; and (2) mens rea need not
 be alleged (or proven) in an HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) charge, as the
 legislative intent to impose absolute liability for an HRS §
 291E-61(a)(3) offense plainly appears. State v. Nesmith, ____
 
Hawai'i ___, ___ P.3d ____ (2012). Accordingly, the ICA gravely 
erred in holding that mens rea need not be alleged in an HRS §
 291E-61(a)(1) charge. Therefore, Padilla’s HRS § 291E-61(a)(1)
 charge was deficient for failing to allege mens rea.
 
1
 HRS § 291E-61(a) provided, at the time of the alleged offense, the
following:
 
A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle under
the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates or
assumes actual physical control of a vehicle: 
(1) While under the influence of alcohol in an amount
sufficient to impair the person’s normal mental faculties or
ability to care for the person and guard against casualty;
(2) While under the influence of any drug that impairs the
person’s ability to operate the vehicle in a careful and
prudent manner;
(3) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two hundred ten
liters of breath; or
(4) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per one hundred
milliliters or cubic centimeters of blood.

                                                            ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
However, the District Court adjudged Padilla guilty of 
violating both HRS §§ 291E-61(a)(1) and (a)(3). Subsections 
(a)(1) and (a)(3) can each serve as the basis for a conviction under HRS § 291E-61. See State v. Grindles, 70 Haw. 528, 530-31, 
777 P.2d 1187, 1189-90 (1989); State v. Caleb, 79 Hawai
'i 336, 
339, 902 P.2d 971, 974 (1995); State v. Mezurashi, 77 Hawai 'i 94, 
98, 881 P.2d 1240, 1244 (1994). Insofar as the HRS § 291E­61(a)(3) charge was sufficient, and insofar as Padilla does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence as to that basis, his conviction still stands. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal
 
is affirmed.
