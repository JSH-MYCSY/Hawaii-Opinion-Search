OPINION OF THE COURT BY LEONARD, J.
Defendant-Appellant Christy L. Lethem ( Father) appeals
from the Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order (Ex Parte TRO )

Restraining Order filed October 5, 2005 (Order), both entered by
the Family Court of the First Circuit ( Family Court).1/  
Plaintiff-Appellee Lily E. Hamilton (Mother ) obtained the Ex
Parte TRO against Father on behalf of the parties' minor child
(Minor), alleging acts of physical and emotional abuse.  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2Following a hearing held on October 5, 2005, the Family Court
entered the Order allowing the Ex Parte TRO to remain in effect
until its expiration on December 22, 2005.
Appearing pro se on appeal, Father argues that (1) the
Family Court's application of Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS)
Chapter 586, providing for ex parte temporary restraining orders
(TROs) and orders for protection arising from domestic abuse,
unconstitutionally infringes on parental rights and violates
constitutional guarantees of due process; (2) the process for
obtaining an ex parte TRO is unconstitutionally gender-biased;
and (3) the Family Court abused its discretion in finding that
past acts of abuse occurred.  On remand from the Hawai i Supreme
Court's opinion in Hamilton ex rel. Lethem v. Lethem , 119 Hawai i
1, 193 P.3d 839 (2008), we now conclude that Father's arguments
are without merit and affirm.»
»
I. BACKGROUND
A. Ex Parte TRO
On September 23, 2005, Mother filed an Ex Parte
Petition for a Temporary Restraining Order for Protection and
Statement ( Petition) on behalf of Minor.  The Petition was
handwritten on a form pleading, with various blanks filled in and
boxes checked off.  It alleged that Father had "physically
harmed, injured or assaulted me [Minor]" by "slapping, punching,
hitting me."  It indicated the last date of this occurrence as
August 25, 2005.  It alleged that Father had "threatened me
[Minor] with physical harm, injury or assault by threatening to
. . . physically hurt me," the last date being August 25, 2005.  
The Petition further alleged that Father "subjected me [Minor] to
extreme psychological abuse by showing up at my school
unannounced, putting me down by blaming financial problems on me,
and saying many problems (such as work problems/emotional
distress) was [sic] my fault."  (Punctuation altered.)  The last
date for this incident was September 16, 2005.  The PetitionFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
3alleged immediate danger of physical and psychological abuse
based on Father's "previous actions such as hitting me [Minor] on
Aug. 12th and Aug. 25th, showing up at my school, and verbally
abusing me."
On September 23, 2005, the Family Court entered the Ex
Parte TRO, prohibiting Father from having contact with Minor. 
The Ex Parte TRO was served on Father that afternoon along with a
notice of the hearing scheduled for October 5, 2005.
B. The Evidentiary Hearing
The Family Court held an evidentiary hearing regarding
the Ex Parte TRO on October 5, 2005.  Minor testified that she
and Father had a visitation arrangement under which she spent
time with him every week and stayed at his house every other
weekend.  She testified regarding three alleged acts of abuse:
1.  On August 11, 2005, Father was scheduled to pick
Minor up from school.  Minor lied to Father, telling him that
Mother would pick her up from school, but instead went with her
friends to obtain a "morning-after" contraceptive pill for one of
her friends.  Father became concerned when he could not locate
Minor, but eventually picked her up from Mother's house.  The
following day, Father and Minor got into an argument about
Minor's behavior.  Minor told Father that he did not need to "get
involved in the situation" because she had already spoken to her
Mother about what had happened.  Minor testified that "because I
wouldn't tell him, he hit me for that, because I wouldn't talk." 
He hit her more than once during the argument.  Minor described
how she blocked his hand before it reached her face.  She further
testified that Father restrained her from calling Mother.
2.  On August 25, 2005, Minor got into another argument
and "power struggle" with Father.  Father had tried to initiate a
conversation with Minor, but she wanted to go to bed as it was
late and she had school the next day.  She further testified:
We continued to argue.  That's when he hit me.  Like, as I
was covering my head, like, he hit me on my arms.  And thenFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
4we started -- once we ended the argument, he left the room. 
And I tried to get to bed, but then I ended up calling my
mother and telling her that I -- that I was uncomfortable
being at my father's house anymore.
She testified that her Father told her, "Don't make me do that
again . . . . Don't make me hit you again." 
3.  Around September 16, 2005, Father unexpectedly
arrived at Minor's school during class hours.  He pulled Minor
out of class and "blam[ed] me [Minor] for financial problems and
[said] how a lot of the things were my fault . . . and that he
was going to pull me out of school and that -- that all of this
was going to end and stuff."  Father told Minor that her younger
sister was "better than [Minor] in this way and this way."  Minor
felt that he was emotionally "getting to me and that it wasn't
right at all."
In support of the Ex Parte TRO, Minor testified that
she felt she was in immediate danger because "[Father] hit me
previous times before, and I feel like he could hit me in the
future or physically harm me in the future because of actions in
the past." 
Father also testified.  He described his strained
relationship with Minor and explained the frequent disciplinary
struggles that arose from her repeated rule-breaking and
misbehavior.  He described each of the three incidents of alleged
abuse as follows:
1.  On August 11, 2005, Father became very concerned
when he realized Minor had lied to him and he was unable to
locate her.  The next morning, he tried to confront Minor about
her behavior.  She became very upset and was "screaming and
yelling" and "ranting and raving."  At one point, Minor tried to
stand up, and Father slapped her on the shoulder.  He testified
that he "would not hit her in the face."
2.  On August 25, 2005, Father picked Minor up from
school.  He had not seen her for several days and wanted to talkFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
5with her and "catch up."  Minor did not want to talk and accused
him of interrogating her.  Several hours later, Father tried to
initiate a conversation and they began to argue.  When Minor
tried to stand up, Father "reached across to sit her back down." 
He denied threatening to hit her.
3.  On September 16, 2005, Father picked Minor up after
school, as Minor had arranged to stay at his house for the
weekend.  When Father arrived at school, Minor told him she had
changed her mind and decided not to stay with him.  Father waited
with Minor until Mother arrived to bring her home from school.  
Father also testified that on one or two prior
occasions, he went to Minor's school to "sit down with [Minor]
and discuss the issues with her" in a counseling context.  He
denied ever blaming financial or emotional problems on Minor.
Father testified that any physical force or contact
with Minor was employed solely to "get her attention" and "not to
hurt her."  Finally, he testified that on the day he was served
with the Ex Parte TRO, Minor called him to ask for a favor and
she was in a good mood. 
C. The Order; Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law
On October 5, 2005, the Family Court entered the Order
determining that "[f]or good cause shown, The Court shall take no
further action."  It directed the TRO to remain in effect until
December 22, 2005. 
On March 31, 2006, the Family Court entered the
following Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law :
FINDINGS OF FACT
1.  The defendant is [Minor's] father.  Petitioner is
[Minor's] mother and has sole legal and physical custody. 
The defendant has visitation rights.  Both petitioner and
defendant have been involved in a protracted and ongoing
custody dispute.
2.  In the weeks prior to August 25, 2005, [Minor] had
helped a sexually active friend and classmate obtain a birth
control product.  When the defendant learned of [Minor's]
involvement, he became quite upset.  Protracted arguments
took place between the defendant and [Minor].FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
63.  At approximately 11:00 p.m. on the evening of August 25,
2005, [Minor] was visiting with the defendant and had just
completed her homework.  Since the following day was a
school day, she wanted to turn in for the night.  The
defendant came to her room and demanded that they continue
their unresolved discussion over her helping a friend obtain
a birth control product.  [Minor] refused to continue the
discussion and stated that she was tired and wanted to go to
bed.  A loud argument ensued which ended with the defendant
striking [Minor] and threatening her with further physical
harm.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
The material allegations of the petition have been proven. 
The defendant is the father of [Minor] and the statutory
blood relationship has been established.  The defendant did
physically harm, injured or assaulted [sic] [Minor] by
striking her on August 25, 2005 and by threatening her with
further physical harm.
The defendant has raised parental discipline under section
703-309(a) HRS.  However, that section applies to criminal
not civil actions.  Moreover, while it would appear that
[Minor] was disciplined by the defendant for assisting her
friend with obtaining a birth control product, discipline
over issues of morals lies with the petitioner, who has sole
legal and physical custody.  Assuming additionally that the
defendant struck [Minor] because of her refusal to discuss
this issue late during a school night, the court concludes
that such an action is not proper parental discipline.
The court, therefore, concludes that the allegations in
support of the Temporary Restraining Order have been proved
and that allowing the order to remain in full force and
effect until the set expiration date of December 22, 2005 as
requested by the petitioner is justified.
Father timely filed a timely notice of appeal.
D. Previous Appellate Disposition
In a summary disposition order issued on May 16, 2008,
this court concluded that Father's appeal was moot because the Ex
Parte TRO expired on December 22, 2005, precluding an effective
remedy on appeal.  Hamilton ex rel. Lethem v. Lethem, No. 27580,
at 3 (App. May 16, 2008) (SDO ).  On writ of certiorari, the
Hawai i Supreme Court held that the issuance of the TRO fell
within the "collateral consequences" exception to the mootness
doctrine.  Hamilton , 119 Hawai i at 11, 193 P.3d at 849.  It
based this holding on the "reasonable possibility" that the TRO
could cause continuing harm to Father's reputation.  Id.  
Accordingly, it vacated the Intermediate Court of Appeal's ( ICA)»
»FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2/Father's opening brief largely fails to conform to Hawai» i Rules
of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP) Rule 28(b).  Generally, a party's "failure to
comply with HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) [concerning points of error] is alone
sufficient to affirm the [lower] court's judgment."  Morgan v. Planning Dep't,
County of Kauai, 104 Hawai »i 173, 180, 86 P.3d 982, 989 (2004).  Nonetheless,
this court observes a policy of affording pro se litigants the opportunity "to
have their cases heard on the merits, where possible."  O'Connor v. Diocese of
Honolulu, 77 Hawai» i 383, 386, 885 P.2d 361, 364 (1994).  Accordingly, we will
consider Father's arguments to the extent we can discern them.
7June 23, 2008  Judgment on Appeal and remanded "with instructions
to address the merits of Father's case."  Id.  at 12, 193 P.3d at
850.
II. POINTS OF ERROR
Father essentially raises the following points of error
on appeal:2/
(1) The Family Court's application of HRS Chapter 586
unconstitutionally infringes on parental rights to discipline and
raise their children without government interference and violates
constitutional guarantees of due process;
(2) The entire process for obtaining an ex parte TRO
is unconstitutionally gender-biased; and 
(3) The Family Court erred in finding that past acts
of abuse occurred.
III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
We review a trial court's findings of fact ( FOFs) under
the clearly erroneous standard.  In re Doe , 95 Hawai i 183, 190,
20 P.3d 616, 623 (2001).»
A FOF is clearly erroneous when (1) the record lacks
substantial evidence to support the finding, or (2) despite
substantial evidence in support of the finding, the
appellate court is nonetheless left with a definite and firm
conviction that a mistake has been made.  "Substantial
evidence" is credible evidence which is of sufficient
quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable
caution to support a conclusion.
Id. (internal quotation marks, citations, and ellipsis omitted).
We review a trial court's conclusions of law ( COLs) de
novo.  Bhakta v. County of Maui , 109 Hawai i 198, 208, 124 P.3d »FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
8943, 953 (2005).  "A COL is not binding upon an appellate court
and is freely reviewable for its correctness.  Moreover, a COL
that is supported by the trial court's FOFs and that reflects an
application of the correct rule of law will not be overturned." 
Id. (internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets in
original omitted).
IV. DISCUSSION
A. HRS Chapter 586 Does Not Violate Procedural or
Substantive Due Process
Father argues that the Family Court's application of
HRS Chapter 586 is unconstitutional because it infringes on
parental rights "to discipline and raise their children without
governmental interference," and it violates constitutional
guarantees of due process.  We construe this point to implicate
both a procedural and substantive due process challenge.
Hawai i courts recognize a presumption that enactments
of the Hawai i Legislature are constitutional.  Father therefore
has the "burden of showing the alleged unconstitutionality beyond
a reasonable doubt."  State v. Kam , 69 Haw. 483, 496, 748 P.2d
372, 380 (1998); accord State v. Adler , 108 Hawai i 169, 177, 118
P.3d 652, 660 (2005). »
»
»
1. Substantive Due Process
The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States
Constitution guarantees that "No State shall . . . deprive any
person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of
law[.]"  U.S. Const. amend. XIV, ÿÿ 1.  The Hawai i Constitution
contains a similar due process clause in article 1, section 5
("No person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property
without due process of law[.]").  This guarantee encompasses two
components of due process:  procedural and substantive.  In re
Doe, 99 Hawai i 522, 533 n.14, 57 P.3d 447, 458 n.14 (2002).  We
address each in turn.»
»FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
9Father alleges that the Family Court's grant of the TRO
infringed on his constitutional right to discipline his child. 
Where a statute or state action implicates a fundamental right,
strict scrutiny applies.  State v. Mallan , 86 Hawai i 440, 451,
950 P.2d 178, 189 (1998); accord Coyle v. Compton, 85 Hawai i
197, 206, 940 P.2d 404, 413 (App. 1997).  Under strict scrutiny
analysis, the state bears the burden of proving that the statute
is narrowly drawn to advance a compelling state interest.  SCI
Mgmt. Corp. v. Sims , 101 Hawai i 438, 460, 71 P.3d 389, 411
(2003).  Where fundamental rights are not implicated, rational
basis review applies.  Mallan, 86 Hawai i at 451, 950 P.2d at
189.  The state action need only "rationally further a legitimate
state interest."  Id. (internal quotation marks and citation
omitted).  Thus, the threshold question is whether HRS Chapter
586 infringes upon a fundamental right.»
»
»
»
Certain parental rights are protected under the due
process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment
to the United States Constitution.  Stanley v. Illinois , 405 U.S.
645, 651 (1972); Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65-66 (2000)
(plurality opinion);  In re Doe , 99 Hawai i at 532, 57 P.3d at
457.  Parental rights are likewise secured under article 1,
section 5 of the Hawai i Constitution.  In re Doe , 99 Hawai i at
533, 57 P.3d at 458; Doe v. Doe , 116 Hawai i 323, 334, 172 P.3d
1067, 1078 (2007); State v. Matavale , 115 Hawai i 149, 158, 166
P.3d 322, 331 (2007).  Foremost among them is the right to
conceive and raise children, which the Supreme Court has
recognized as an "essential, basic civil right[.]"  In re Doe , 99
Hawai i at 532, 57 P.3d at 457 (internal quotation marks and
ellipses omitted) (quoting Stanley , 405 U.S. at 651).  Parents
enjoy a fundamental liberty interest in the "care, custody, and
control of their children."  Id. (quoting Troxel, 530 U.S. at 65
(plurality opinion)); see also  Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S.
158, 166 (1944) ("It is cardinal with us that the custody, care»
» »
»
»
»FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
10and nurture of the child reside first in the parents[.]");
Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 753 (1982) (recognizing the
"fundamental liberty interest of natural parents in the care,
custody, and management of their child").
Nonetheless, parental rights are not unlimited in their
scope.  Prince , 321 U.S. at 166.  Parents do not possess a
fundamental right to discipline their children in any way they
see fit.  See id. at 167.  Certainly they do not possess a right
to inflict severe bodily harm or extreme psychological injury on
their children, even in the name of discipline.  See, e.g., State
v. Crouser , 81 Hawai i 5, 15, 911 P.2d 725, 735 (1996)
(recognizing that parents do not have constitutional right to
inflict upon children "force that the legislature has deemed to
be excessive and harmful to the child's welfare").  »
In a somewhat analogous case, the Hawai i Supreme Court
considered the contours of a respondent's constitutional right to
freedom of movement.  Coyle , 85 Hawai i at 206-07, 940 P.2d at
413-14.  There , the respondent alleged that the ex parte TRO
issued under the domestic abuse statute infringed upon his
fundamental right to freedom of movement.  Id. at 206, 940 P.2d
at 413.  The supreme court recognized that although such a
freedom is guaranteed under the Hawai i Constitution, it is not
absolute, but is subject to curtailment where it infringes upon
the rights of others.  Id.  at 207, 940 P.2d at 414.  The
respondent did not have a "constitutionally protected right to
remain free in [his] home after physically harming someone
residing there."  Id.  (citation omitted).  The court therefore
concluded that the TRO did not "unreasonably infringe upon a
defendant's freedom of movement."  Id. »
»
»
Although Coyle did not address the particular right
asserted here, its analysis is applicable.  Just as the right to
freedom of movement is not absolute, so too the right of parents
to discipline their children is not unlimited.  Matavale , 115FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
3/In Crouser , the Hawai» i Supreme Court summarily rejected the
respondent's argument that the parental justification defense under HRS ÿÿ 703-
309(1) (Supp. 2001) was overbroad because it proscribed constitutionally
protected conduct.  Crouser , 81 Hawai» i at 15, 911 P.2d at 735.  The court
noted that "[Defendant] points to no constitutional provision that protects
his right to inflict upon a child, especially one not his own, force that the
legislature has deemed to be excessive and harmful to the child's welfare." 
Id.  Here, likewise, Father does not have a constitutionally protected right
to inflict force upon Minor that falls within the definition of domestic abuse
under HRS ÿÿ 586-1 (1993).
4/HRS ÿÿ 586-1 defines "domestic abuse" as:
(1)Physical harm, bodily injury, assault, or the threat of imminent
physical harm, bodily injury, or assault, extreme psychological abuse or
malicious property damage between family or household members; or
(2)Any act which would constitute an offense under section 709-906, or
under part V or VI of chapter 707 committed against a minor family or
household member by an adult family or household member.
"Extreme psychological abuse" means an intentional or knowing course of
conduct directed at an individual that seriously alarms or disturbs
consistently or continually bothers the individual, and that serves no
legitimate purpose; provided that such course of conduct would cause a
reasonable person to suffer extreme emotional distress.
11Hawaii at 158-59, 166 P.3d at 331-32 (noting that statutory
privilege to exercise physical force to discipline a child is not
unlimited); see also Sweaney v. Ada County, Idaho, 119 F.3d 1385,
1391 (9th Cir. 1997) (holding there is no clearly established
constitutional right of parent to strike child for disciplinary
purposes on public school grounds).  Parents do not have a
constitutional right to inflict excessive force upon their
children as acts of discipline.  See  Crouser, 81 Hawai i at 15,
911 P.2d at 735.3/  »
»
On its face, HRS Chapter 586 does not directly infringe
upon the fundamental right of parents over the "care, custody,
and control of their children."  In re Doe , 99 Hawai i at 532, 57
P.3d at 457 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  It
only applies to acts of "domestic abuse" -- essentially acts or
threats of "[p]hysical harm, bodily injury, assault," and extreme
psychological abuse.  HRS ÿÿ 586-1.4/  As parents do not possess a
fundamental right to inflict force or harm upon a child that "the
legislature has deemed to be excessive and harmful to the child's»FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
5/Father references Troxel, 530 U.S. 57, in support of his argument
regarding parental rights.  Troxel concerned the constitutionality of a state
statute that allowed any person to obtain visitation rights, over the parents'
objections, where the court determined it was in the best interests of the
child.  530 U.S. at 61, 67.  In striking down the statute, a plurality of the
Supreme Court noted that 
so long as a parent adequately cares for his or her children
(i.e., is fit), there will normally be no reason for the
State to inject itself into the private realm of the family
to further question the ability of that parent to make the
best decisions concerning the rearing of that parent's
children. 
Id. at 68-69; see also Doe, 116 Hawai» i at 333-35, 172 P.3d at 1077-79
(striking down similar grandparent visitation statute).  
Unlike the statute in Troxel, the domestic abuse TRO does not so broadly and
directly restrict a fit parent's ability to make decisions concerning child-
rearing.  At most, it temporarily divests a parent of his or her visitation
rights, pending an evidentiary hearing, in order to protect the safety of the
(continued...)
12welfare," rational basis review applies.  See Crouser , 81 Hawai i
at 15, 911 P.2d at 735. »
Under a rational basis review, the state may properly
impose limits on disciplinary measures involving physical force
so long as they are rationally related to a legitimate government
interest.  Mallan, 86 Hawai i at 451, 950 P.2d at 189.  Ex parte
TROs under Chapter 586 are rationally related to the legitimate
state interest in protecting minors from physical and
psychological harm.  See id. at 451-52, 950 P.2d at 189-90 ("A
state interest is 'legitimate' if it involves the public health,
safety, or welfare.").»
Indeed, Chapter 586 would withstand strict scrutiny as
well.  Under strict scrutiny analysis, the statute must be
narrowly drawn to advance a compelling state interest.  SCI Mgmt.
Corp. v. Sims, 101 Hawai i 438, 460, 71 P.3d 389, 411 (2003). 
Here, Chapter 586 advances a compelling state interest in
preventing harm to children.  See Doe, 116 Hawai i at 335-36, 172
P.3d at 1079-80.  The state as parens patriae  may validly
restrict parental rights to ensure children's education, safety,
and welfare.5/  Prince , 321 U.S. at 166; Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406»

(...continued)
child.  HRS ÿÿÿÿ 586-4 (Supp. 2004); 586-5 (Supp. 1998).  The right at issue is
thus qualitatively different from the broad parental rights implicated in
Troxel and Doe.
13U.S. 205, 233-34 (1972) (recognizing that parental rights "may be
subject to limitation . . . if it appears that parental decisions
will jeopardize the health or safety of the child"); Matavale ,
115 Hawai i at 158, 166 P.3d at 331 ("The state, however, in the
interest of protecting the child's welfare, has a right to limit
parental freedom in raising their children.").  Paramount among
these considerations is the state's "powerful interest in
preventing and deterring the battering of children."  Crouser, 81
Hawai i at 14, 911 P.2d at 734.  The state may thus curtail
parental disciplinary rights in order to protect children, who
are amongst the most vulnerable members of society.  See  Prince,
321 U.S. at 166.  »
»
Additionally, HRS Chapter 586 is narrowly drawn to avoid
unduly burdening the exercise of parental rights.  The definition
of "domestic abuse" is narrowly tailored to encompass only acts
or threats of "[p]hysical harm, bodily injury, assault," or a
course of conduct that "would cause a reasonable person to suffer
extreme emotional distress."  HRS ÿÿ 586-1.  An ex parte TRO may
only be obtained upon a showing of probable cause that acts of
abuse may be imminent.  HRS ÿÿ 586-4(c).  As discussed below,
Chapter 586 contains sufficient procedural safeguards to protect
the defendant's liberty interests.  See infra part IV(A)(2).  It
is therefore narrowly tailored to protect a compelling state
interest.FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
6/Father also challenges the Family Court's conclusion that
"discipline over issues of morals lies with [Mother], who has sole legal and
physical custody."  Given our ultimate conclusion that the Family Court did
not abuse its discretion in issuing the Ex Parte TRO, see  infra part IV(C), we
need not address this point.
7/This statute provides, in relevant part:
§ 703-309  Use of force by persons with special
responsibility for care, discipline, or safety of others. 
The use of force upon or toward the person of another is
justifiable under the following circumstances:
(1) The actor is the parent or guardian or other
person similarly responsible for the general
care and supervision of a minor, or a person
acting at the request of the parent, guardian,
or other responsible person, and:
(a) The force is employed with due regard for
the age and size of the minor and is
reasonably related to the purpose of
safeguarding or promoting the welfare of
the minor, including the prevention or
punishment of the minor's misconduct; and
(b) The force used is not designed to cause or
known to create a risk of causing
substantial bodily injury, disfigurement,
extreme pain or mental distress, or
neurological damage.
14As a related argument, Father asserts that the Family
Court erred in failing to apply the "parental discipline"
justification provided in the penal code at HRS ÿÿ 703-309(1).6/ 
He argues, in essence, that the Family Court was constitutionally
required to consider such a defense to the TRO.
HRS ÿÿ 703-309(1) provides a justification to criminal
liability for acts constituting parental discipline.7/  Its
language does not expressly or implicitly extend the
justification to civil proceedings for a domestic abuse TRO under
HRS Chapter 586.  Moreover, the definition of "domestic abuse"
under Chapter 586 is broad enough to encompass conduct that could
satisfy the parental discipline justification.  See  HRS ÿÿ 586-1. 
It includes "[p]hysical harm, bodily injury, assault, or the
threat of imminent physical harm, bodily injury, or assault,FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
8/Father references Rezentes v. Rezentes, 88 Hawai» i 200, 965 P.2d
133 (App. 1998), in support of his argument regarding the parental discipline
justification.  In that case, the ICA concluded that the definition of "family
violence" under HRS ÿÿ 571-46(9) (1993), relating to child custody, did not
include conduct viewed as permissible parental discipline pursuant to HRS ÿÿ
703-309(1). Id. at 201, 965 P.2d at 134.  The lower court had specifically
found that Mother's conduct fell within the definition of parental discipline
under HRS ÿÿ 703-309(1).  Id. at 205, 965 P.2d at 138.  The ICA concluded that
the term "family violence," for purposes of child custody, did not include
conduct that constituted permissible discipline.  Id.   It reasoned that the
Legislature would not "sanction in one statute the use of certain physical
force by a parent to discipline his or her children, and yet characterize in
another statute the use of such force as family violence, potentially
depriving a parent of custody or visitation."  Id.  at 205-06, 965 P.2d at 138-
39.  Unlike a custody determination, which is of a more permanent nature and
which is made after a full hearing of the issues, an ex parte TRO is temporary
in duration and is intended to provide immediate relief if there is "probable
cause to believe that a past act or acts of abuse have occurred, or that
threats of abuse make it probable that acts of abuse may be imminent.  See  HRS
§ 586-4(a) & (c) (emphasis added).  It therefore appears that the Legislature
intended a lower threshold of proof of domestic abuse for purposes of an ex
parte TRO in order to afford immediate, but temporary, protection to potential
victims of domestic violence.  Moreover, unlike in Rezentes , the Family Court
determined that Father's striking of Minor did not fall within the parameters
of proper parental discipline under HRS ÿÿ 703-309(1).
9/The Family Court specifically found that Father "physically
harm[ed], injured or assaulted [Minor] by striking her on August 25, 2005 and
by threatening her with further physical harm."  It concluded that "[a]ssuming
the defendant struck [Minor] because of her refusal to discuss [behavioral
issues] late during a school night, . . . such an action is not proper
parental discipline."  It is thus implicit in the Family Court's findings that
(continued...)
15extreme psychological abuse or malicious property damage between
family or household members" in addition to acts which constitute
criminal domestic abuse under HRS ÿÿ 709-906.  Id.   The
Legislature thus intended the definition of acts constituting
domestic violence for purposes of TROs to be broader than those
subjected to criminal liability under the penal code.8/ 
In any event, in order to satisfy the parental
discipline defense, the force employed must have been "reasonably
related to the purpose of safeguarding or promoting the welfare
of the minor."  HRS ÿÿ 703-309(1)(a).  Here, the Family Court
addressed father's permissible discipline argument and concluded
that even if the defense were available, Father's use of force
was not reasonably related to safeguarding or promoting Minor's
welfare.9/ FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
9/(...continued)
Father's actions were not reasonably calculated to promote Minor's welfare.
162.Procedural Due Process
Father also argues that the process for obtaining an ex
parte TRO under HRS Chapter 586 falls short of the constitutional
requirements of procedural due process.  Specifically, he
challenges the issuance of ex parte TROs without a prior hearing
or interview to test the petitioner's veracity.  He challenges
the provision of form pleadings, which he contends render the
process "ripe for horrible abuse."  He argues that the Family
Court should be required to make specific factual findings in
issuing an ex parte TRO.  Finally, he appears to advocate a
higher burden of proof in justifying the issuance of an ex parte
TRO. 
First, we note that Hawai i courts have upheld various
portions of HRS Chapter 586.  In Coyle , for example, the supreme
court held that imposing the preponderance of the evidence
standard at the TRO hearing, rather than the clear and convincing
evidence standard, did not violate the defendant's equal
protection or substantive due process rights.  85 Hawai i at 206-
08, 940 P.2d at 413-15.  In another case, the supreme court
considered the constitutionality of ex parte TROs issued under
Hawai i Family Court Rules ( HFCR) Rule 65(b).  In re Guardianship
of Carlsmith, 113 Hawai i 236, 239-40, 151 P.3d 717, 720-21
(2007).  Like Chapter 586, Rule 65(b) provides for ex parte
restraining orders where the petitioner alleges specific facts
showing that "immediate relief" is warranted.  It further allows
the adverse party to move for dissolution or modification and
request a hearing upon providing two days' notice to the
petitioner.  Id. at 240, 151 P.3d at 721.  The respondents in
Guardianship of Carlsmith  maintained that issuing ex parte TROs
in this manner violated procedural due process.  113 Hawai i at
239-40, 151 P.3d at 720-21.  The supreme court concluded that in»

11/It appears that every state offers similar remedies in domestic
abuse situations, including provisions for ex parte relief.  Nollet v.
Justices of the Trial Court of Mass., 83 F. Supp. 2d 204, 212 (D. Mass. 2000).
17view of the emergency nature of Rule 65 TROs, the process offered
sufficient safeguards by requiring specific factual allegations
and allowing the respondent to swiftly seek a hearing.  Id.  at
241-42, 151 P.3d at 722-23.  In dicta, the court noted generally
that "TROs, in view of their emergency remedial nature, may
constitutionally be granted ex parte ."  Id. (internal quotation
marks, brackets, and citation omitted).10/  However, it appears
that Hawai i courts have not yet directly considered a procedural
due process challenge to the ex parte nature of domestic abuse
TROs under HRS ÿÿ 586-4.11/»
Procedural due process requires "notice and an
opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful
manner before governmental deprivation of a significant liberty
interest."  Guardianship of Carlsmith , 113 Hawai i at 239, 151
P.3d at 720 (citation omitted).  Beyond this core requirement,
procedural due process is not a technical, fixed concept.

requirements vary depending on the type of proceeding.

Due process is ultimately a flexible concept that "calls for such
procedural protections as the particular situation demands."  Id.
at 239-40, 151 P.3d at 720-21 (citation omitted).»

Due process does not always require prior notice and a
pre-deprivation hearing.  Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527, 540
(1981), overruled in part on other grounds by Daniels v.FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
12/The Supreme Court in Mathews ultimately upheld the challenged
post-deprivation procedures for terminating social security disability
benefits.  424 U.S. at 349.  It weighed the temporary nature of the
deprivation and the particular post-deprivation safeguards, which included
notification of intent to terminate benefits, an opportunity to respond in
writing and proffer additional evidence, the ability to seek post-deprivation
intra-agency review, and the opportunity to appeal the termination.  Id.  at
341-49.
18Williams , 474 U.S. 327 (1986).  In some circumstances, post-
deprivation procedures will satisfy due process.  Id.  In Mathews
v. Eldridge , the United States Supreme Court articulated a
standard for determining whether post-deprivation procedures are
constitutionally adequate.12/  424 U.S. at 334-35.  It set forth
three factors that courts must weigh in determining the precise
requirements of due process for a particular deprivation:  (1)
the private interest at stake; (2) the government's interest,
"including the function involved and the fiscal and
administrative burdens" entailed in more protective procedures;
and (3) the probable value of additional or substitute procedural
safeguards.  Id.  at 335.
Where a deprivation is effected through state action on
behalf of a private party, as in the case of prejudgment
attachments to a party's property, the Supreme Court has applied
a modified version of the Mathews v. Eldridge  test.  See
Connecticut v. Doehr , 501 U.S. 1, 11 (1991).  Instead of
examining only the government's interest, the second factor looks
principally to the "interest of the party seeking the . . .
remedy, with, nonetheless, due regard for any ancillary interest
the government may have in providing the procedure or forgoing
the added burden of providing greater protections."  Id.   As with
prejudgment attachments, ex parte TROs are effected primarily forFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
13/In considering the constitutionality of similar ex parte TRO
statutes, the vast majority of courts have applied either the Mathews v.
Eldridge or the modified Mathews-Doehr test.  See, e.g., Pendleton v.
Minichino, 1992 WL 75920, at *5-11 (Conn. Super. Ct. 1992) (applying Mathews-
Doehr); McKinney v. McKinney, 820 N.E.2d 682, 688 (Ind. Ct. App. 2005)
(applying Mathews ); Knight v. Knight, 525 N.W.2d 841, 844 (Iowa 1994)
(applying Mathews to reject challenge regarding sufficiency of notice); State

1989); Marquette v. Marquette , 686 P.2d 990, 995-96 (Okla. Ct. App. 1984);
Boyle v. Boyle, 12 Pa. D. & C.3d 767, 774-75 (1979) (weighing interests of
state, petitioner, and defendant, although not expressly applying Mathews);

statute providing for emergency TRO hearing); State v. Karas, 32 P.3d 1016,
1020-21 (Wash. Ct. App. 2001). 
A few courts have also applied the test set forth in Fuentes v.
Shevin, 407 U.S. 67 (1972).  See Baker v. Baker, 494 N.W.2d 282, 287-88 (Minn.
1992) superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in Burkstand v.
Burkstand, 632 N.W.2d 206, 212 (Minn. 2001).  (applying both Mathews  and
Fuentes  tests); accord State ex rel. Williams, 626 S.W.2d at 232.  Fuentes
concerned the constitutionality of several statutes authorizing the summary
seizure of chattels under a prejudgment writ of replevin without a prior
hearing.  407 U.S. at 69-78.  The Court set forth the following test for
considering the constitutionality of seizures without a pre-deprivation
hearing:  (1) the seizure must be "directly necessary to secure an important
governmental or general public interest"; (2) there must be a "special need
for very prompt action"; and (3) the state must maintain "strict control over
its monopoly of legitimate force."  Id.  at 91.  Because ex parte TROs do not
effect a seizure of chattels, the Mathews-Doehr test is more applicable.  See
Mitchell v. W. T. Grant Co., 416 U.S. 600, 611 (1974) (noting that line of
cases culminating in Fuentes  and its companion case "merely stand for the
proposition that a hearing must be had before one is finally deprived of his
property and do[es] not deal at all with the need for a pretermination hearing
where a full and immediate post-termination hearing is provided").
19the benefit of a private party -- the petitioner.  As a result,
the modified Mathews-Doehr  test applies.13/
First, we consider the private interest at stake. 
Mathews, 424 U.S. at 335.  As noted above, it is well-established
that parents enjoy a protected liberty interest in the custody,
care, and upbringing of their children.  Stanley, 405 U.S. at
651; In re Doe , 99 Hawai i at 532, 57 P.3d at 457.  The Hawai i
Constitution also protects freedom of movement, subject to the
state's reasonable exercise of its police power.  Coyle, 85
Hawai i at 206-07, 940 P.2d at 413-14.  Ex parte TROs may
implicate both of these interests.  See  Blazel v. Bradley, 698 F.
Supp. 756, 762 (W.D. Wis. 1988); State ex rel. Williams, 626
S.W.2d at 230.  Here, it temporarily deprived Father of his» »
»FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
20relationship with Minor by precluding him from contacting her and
temporarily terminating his visitation rights.  Although the
deprivation was limited in duration, its temporary nature does
not obviate the requirements of procedural due process.  Fuentes ,
407 U.S. at 84-85 ("[I]t is now well settled that a temporary,
nonfinal deprivation . . . is nonetheless a 'deprivation' in the
terms of the Fourteenth Amendment."); see also  Pendleton , 1992 WL
75920, at *5 (recognizing that visitation rights are entitled to
due process protection, even against temporary deprivations);
State v. Fernando A. , 981 A.2d 427, 442 n.18 (Conn. 2009) (noting
"significant impact" of analogous criminal protective order on
defendant's fundamental rights); Halverson ex rel. Halverson v.
Taflin, 617 N.W.2d 448, 451 (Minn. Ct. App. 2000) ("Even a
temporary order for protection may deprive a parent of a liberty
interest in his or her child."); Marquette , 686 P.2d at 995
(noting that temporary interference with father's visitation
rights is constitutionally significant).  The length and severity
of the deprivation factors into the analysis but is not decisive. 
Fuentes, 407 U.S. at 86.  The Ex Parte TRO in this case therefore
implicated Father's significant liberty interests.
Second, we consider the petitioner's interests, as well
as the government's ancillary interests.  Doehr, 501 U.S. at 11. 
A petitioner for a domestic abuse TRO has a weighty interest in
remaining free from physical and psychological abuse.  Domestic
violence is often volatile, quick to escalate, and potentially
fatal.  The victim has a strong interest in obtaining immediate
relief, as delay may result in further injury or death.  See
Catherine F. Klein and Leslye E. Orloff, Providing Legal
Protection for Battered Women: An Analysis of State Statutes and
Case Law, 21 Hofstra L. Rev. 801, 1155 (Summer 1993).  For many
victims of domestic violence, an ex parte TRO is the only
practical vehicle to "rescue them from violent attacks and FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
21threats of abuse."  H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 549, in 1987 House
Journal, at 1359.
The State likewise has a strong interest in protecting
family and household members from harm.  Coyle , 85 Hawai i at
208, 940 P.2d at 415.  The State's responsibility to protect its
citizens especially extends to vulnerable members of society,
such as children and "those who cannot protect themselves."  Id.
at 205-206, 940 P.2d at 412-13 (quoting H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No.
130, in 1965 House Journal, at 550).  Domestic violence is a
problem of "considerable magnitude" that can result in the death
of the victim.  Marquette , 686 P.2d at 996.  »
Moreover, domestic abuse "has wide-ranging
ramifications" and is undoubtedly "an issue of broad public
interest."  Id.  at 993.  It often affects the community as a
whole, giving rise to other social ills such as cycles of abuse,
crimes of violence against person and property, juvenile
delinquency, and alcohol and drug abuse.  Karas , 32 P.3d at 1020. 
Domestic violence is often self-perpetuating, as children raised
in violent homes may be more likely to exhibit violent behaviors
as adults.  Nadine Taub, Ex Parte Proceedings in Domestic
Violence Situations: Alternative Frameworks for Constitutional
Scrutiny, 9 Hofstra L. Rev. 95, 96 (1980-1981); Dorothy Carl
Quinn, Ex Parte Protection Orders: Is Due Process Locked Out? , 58
Temp. L.Q. 843, 844 n.4 (1985); Note, Linda R. Keenan, Domestic
Violence and Custody Litigation: The Need for Statutory Reform,
13 Hofstra L. Rev. 407, 420-21 (1985).  
As our legislature has recognized, "domestic violence
is one of the most serious problems affecting our community."  S.
Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 3252, in 1998 Senate Journal, at 1314. 
Thus, the public itself has an "extraordinary interest in a
society free from violence, especially where vulnerable persons
are at risk."  Baker, 494 N.W.2d at 288; see also Grant v. Pugh,
887 N.Y.S.2d 802, 808 (N.Y. Fam. Ct. 2009) (recognizing that a FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
22state's "extraordinary interest in protecting victims of domestic
violence from actual or threatened injury and children from the
effects of exposure to domestic violence justifies the use of
immediate measures to stop the violence") (internal quotation
marks and citation omitted).  Ex parte TROs therefore protect
significant interests of both the petitioner and the State.
Third, we consider the risk of erroneous deprivation,
the "fairness and reliability of the existing [pre-deprivation]
procedures," and the probable value of additional safeguards. 
Mathews, 424 U.S. at 335, 343.  The ex parte TRO process under
HRS Chapter 586 includes a number of procedural safeguards.  The
petitioner must allege past acts of abuse or threats of abuse,
including the "specific facts and circumstances from which relief
is sought."  HRS ÿÿ 586-3(c) (Supp. 2004).  The allegations must
be made under oath and penalty of perjury.  Id.  An ex parte TRO
may only be granted if necessary to prevent acts of abuse, and
only upon a finding of probable cause that past acts have
occurred or that further abuse is imminent.  HRS ÿÿ 586-4(c).  The
court must hold a hearing on the earliest possible date, but no
later than within fifteen days from the date of issuance.  HRS ÿÿ
586-5(b).  At the hearing, the petitioner has the burden of
proving the allegations by a preponderance of the evidence. 
Coyle, 85 Hawai i at 206, 940 P.2d at 413.  Because the Family
Court has discretion to determine the duration of the TRO
(subject to a ninety-day limit), the defendant may move to vacate
or modify the TRO at any point.  Kie, 91 Hawai i at 442, 984 P.2d
at 1268.  Chapter 586 thus provides a number of procedural
safeguards, including a plenary post-deprivation hearing, to
protect the defendant's interests.»
»
Father argues that the court should hold a hearing, or
at least an interview, prior to issuance in order to test the
petitioner's veracity.  Such a requirement, however, would
vitiate the ex parte nature of the TRO.  The purpose of an exFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
23parte TRO is to prevent further acts of abuse by "assur[ing] a
period of separation" between the parties.  State v. Grindling,
96 Hawai i 402, 404, 31 P.3d 915, 917 (2001); accord  Kie, 91
Hawai i at 442, 984 P.2d at 1268; Coyle, 85 Hawai i at 205, 940
P.2d at 412.  Immediate relief is often necessary to enable a
victim of domestic violence to swiftly escape a volatile
situation.  Requiring prior notice or an immediate hearing would
subject the petitioner to an increased risk of abuse.  Baker, 494
N.W.2d at 288 (noting that requiring prior notice would "result
in unnecessary and possibly dangerous time delays.") ; Boyle, 12
Pa. D. & C.3d at 774 .  Moreover, ex parte TROs serve an important
function in providing emergency relief without the formality,
time-intensiveness, and procedural obstacles of other civil and
criminal remedies.  They provide a swift and accessible remedy to
meet the urgency of a domestic abuse situation.  See In re
Marriage of Fiffe, 140 P.3d 160, 162 (Colo. Ct. App. 2005) ("A
temporary protection order is usually requested under immediate,
urgent circumstances and, thus, most often is ruled upon ex
parte."); Paschal v. Hazlinsky , 803 So.2d 413, 417 (La. Ct. App.
2001) (noting urgency of domestic violence situations).  Thus,
requiring a prior hearing would defeat the purpose of offering
immediate relief from imminent danger.  Boyle, 12 Pa. D. & C.3d
at 774.»
» »
Father also suggests that the availability of form
pleadings renders the process too vulnerable to abuse.  We
disagree.  Form pleadings allow victims of domestic violence
greater accessibility to the courts and render the process more
amenable to obtaining emergency relief.  In requiring the
availability of form pleadings, the Legislature sought to
simplify the procedure by "enabl[ing] applicants for a temporary
retraining order to apply for the order themselves."  Conf. Com.
Rep. No. 17, in 1979 Senate Journal, at 945; see also  Conf. Com.
Rep. No. 15, in 1979 House Journal, at 1077.  In 1982, it re-FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
24enacted the statutory scheme for ex parte TROs, including the
availability of form pleadings, in order to "streamline the
procedures for obtaining and issuing ex parte temporary
restraining orders" and as part of a broader effort to provide
"greater flexibility in trying to calm the emotionally charged
nature of [domestic abuse] situations."  Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 1,
in 1982 House Journal, at 815; S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 643, in
1982 Senate Journal, at 1222.  The forms still require the
petitioner to supply the specific factual allegations in their
own words.  Finally, the forms contain a declaration that the
petition is made under penalty of perjury.  Given the exigent
nature of ex parte TROs, and the State's legitimate interest in
providing an accessible procedure for obtaining them, the form
pleadings offer sufficient protection of both parties' interests.
Next, Father argues that the Family Court should be
required to enter specific findings as to the underlying
allegations before issuing an ex parte TRO.  He maintains that
"[a] generic finding of abuse or threats is insufficient to
determine probable cause."  (Emphasis omitted.)  In issuing an ex
parte TRO, the order itself must state that the Family Court has
found "probable cause to believe that a past act or acts of abuse
have occurred, or that threats of abuse make it probable that
acts of abuse may be imminent," and that the order is necessary
to prevent further abuse by ensuring a period of separation.  HRS
ÿÿ 586-4(c).  Because of the nature of the ex parte process, the
sole basis for the Family Court's finding is the petition itself. 
Requiring the Family Court to issue additional findings detailing
the allegations contained in the petition would therefore be of
little value and would cause unnecessary delay.
Finally, Father appears to contend that due process
requires a higher burden of proof for issuing ex parte TROs.  He
references the "totality of circumstances" standard for probable
cause in the criminal context, as set forth in Illinois v. Gates ,FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
14/ The criminal standard involves due consideration for the
defendant's weighty liberty interest in remaining free from unfounded arrests
and charges of crime.  Maganis , 109 Hawai »i at 87-88, 123 P.3d at 682-83.

(codifying "facts and circumstances" test for probable cause for
arrest).  This standard reflects the Family Court's limited
ability to weigh conflicting evidence in the context of an ex
parte petition.  The court need not apply the preponderance of
the evidence standard where only one party's evidence is
available.  Given the nature of the ex parte process, the weight
of the state's interest in preventing domestic violence, and the
petitioner's interest in avoiding imminent abuse, the probable
cause standard provides an adequate procedural safeguard.  »

Numerous courts have upheld ex parte TROs or orders for
protection under similar provisions so long as at least four
minimum procedural safeguards are present: "[1] participation by
a judicial officer; [2] a prompt post-deprivation hearing; [3]
verified petitions or affidavits containing detailed allegations
based on personal knowledge; and [4] risk of immediate and
irreparable harm."  Blazel , 698 F. Supp. at 764.15/  HRS Chapter
586 provides all four safeguards: only a family court judge mayFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
16/Various courts have readily upheld ex parte TRO statutes providing
for a post-deprivation hearing within seven to fifteen days.  See  Quinn, Ex
Parte Protection Orders, 58 Temp. L.Q. at 850 (noting range of five to twenty
days); Pendleton , 1992 WL 75920, at *9 (fourteen days); Kampf v. Kampf, 603
N.W.2d 295, 299 (Mich. Ct. App. 1999) (five to fourteen days); Baker, 494
N.W.2d at 290 (seven days); State ex rel. Williams, 626 S.W.2d at 231 (fifteen
days); Boyle, 12 Pa. D. & C.3d at 771 (ten days); Karas, 32 P.3d at 1019
(fourteen or twenty-four days, depending on type of service); Schramek v.
Bohren, 429 N.W.2d 501, 504 (Wis. Ct. App. 1988) (seven days).  Other courts
have upheld statutes providing for a hearing within twenty days.  See, e.g.,
MacDonald v. State, 997 P.2d 1187, 1189 (Alaska 2000).  HRS ÿÿ 586-5(b) thus
falls within a widely accepted range.
17/The legislative history of section 586-4 confirms that the purpose
of ex parte TROs is to provide emergency relief from imminent harm.  In 1998,
the Legislature removed the requirement that the petitioner allege recent acts
or threats of abuse in order to obtain an ex parte TRO.  See  1998 Haw. Sess.
Laws Act 172, ÿÿ 2 at 642-43.  However, it cautioned that "[i]ssuing
restraining orders for acts of abuse that occurred in the distant past would
be inconsistent with the purpose of temporary restraining orders."  H. Stand.
Comm. Rep. No. 578-98, in 1998 House Journal, at 1264.  The Legislature has
consistently affirmed the purpose of ex parte TROs to prevent imminent
violence by "assuring a period of separation of the parties involved."  1979
Haw. Sess. Laws, Act 168, ÿÿ 1 at 345-46; see also  S. Stand. Com. Rep. No.
3252, in 1998 Senate Journal, at 1314-15; H. Stand. Com. Rep. No. 578-98, in

26issue an ex parte TRO; a hearing must be held within fifteen
days;16/ the verified petition must allege specific facts based on
personal knowledge; and the ex parte TRO must be necessary to
prevent acts of abuse.  See HRS ÿÿÿÿ 586-3(c); 586-4(c); 586-5(b). 
Although it does not expressly require a risk of immediate harm,
such a requirement is inherent in the condition that ex parte
TROs be granted only if necessary to prevent acts of abuse.  HRS
ÿÿ 586-4(c).  The overall standard requires the petitioner to
allege immediate danger because past acts or threats render it
"probable that acts of abuse may be imminent."  Id.  This
standard reflects the core function of ex parte TROs as an
emergency remedy.17/
There is undoubtably some residual risk of error in the
ex parte process.  See, e.g., Forman, 546 N.Y.S.2d at 765
(recognizing risk of error in absence of prior evidentiary
hearing).  In making its initial decision, the court has only the
petitioner's affidavit to rely upon and does not have the
advantage of considering live witnesses who are subject to cross-FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
18/Some commentators have reflected that the nature of domestic abuse
lessens the risk of error in issuing ex parte TROs.  See Taub, Ex Parte
Proceedings in Domestic Violence Situations, 9 Hofstra L. Rev. at 116-20. 
Victims of domestic abuse are often reluctant to seek the assistance of courts
because of negative social stigma, fear of retaliation, and complex
psychological reasons.  Id.  
19/In so holding, we join with a number of other courts that have
upheld similar provisions for ex parte TROs in domestic abuse situations
against procedural due process challenges.  See, e.g. , Pendleton, 1992 WL
75920, at *11 (concluding that ex parte TROs are "directly necessary to effect
the valid government interest in protecting the victims of physical abuse");
Fernando A., 981 A.2d at 443-45 (upholding similar provision regarding
criminal order for protection); Sanders v. Shephard , 541 N.E.2d 1150, 1155-56
(Ill. Ct. App. 1989) (concluding that exigent circumstances justify ex parte
process); Kampf, 603 N.W.2d at 299-300; Baker, 494 N.W.2d at 288; State ex

27examination.  It is especially difficult for a family court judge
to discern possible improper motives, such as retaliation or
strategy related to an underlying divorce or custody case,
through an ex parte petition.  Pendleton , 1992 WL 75920, at *6.  
Nevertheless, the strength of the state's and
petitioner's interests, the "emergency nature of the decision,"
and the "practical difficulties inherent in convening an
immediate evidentiary hearing", mitigate against requiring
further procedural protections.18/  Forman, 546 N.Y.S.2d at 765
(upholding ex parte TROs despite "the evident if unquantifiable
risk of error"); see also  Pendleton , 1992 WL 75920, at *8
(concluding that imposing evidentiary requirements would create
procedural obstacles and time-consuming delay, "frustrating the
effective and immediate protection that the legislature sought to
make available"); Halverson ex rel. Halverson , 617 N.W.2d at 451
(noting in dicta that in "ex parte emergency circumstances,"
parent's due process interests yield to considerations of child's
welfare).  Due process does not require procedural safeguards to
be so comprehensive as to "preclude any possibility of error." 
Mackey v. Montrym , 443 U.S. 1, 13 (1979).
We therefore reject Father's various arguments to the
effect that HRS Chapter 586 provides insufficient safeguards to
comport with procedural due process requirements.19/FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

28B.The Process for Obtaining an Ex Parte TRO Is Not
Unconstitutionally Gender-Biased
As his second point of error, Father essentially
asserts that the process for obtaining an ex parte TRO is
unconstitutionally gender-biased.  However, he raises only
conclusory allegations that the ex parte process is
"discriminatory against men," resulting in "gender profiling."  
He requests that the "bias and brainwashing regarding male-only
perpetrators or batter[ers] end completely."  Given his failure
to assert a cogent argument, we need not address this point of
error.  See  HRAP Rule 28(b)(7) ("Points not argued may be deemed
waived.").
Even if we were to construe Father's argument as an
equal protection claim, it is without merit.  In order to assert
a gender-based equal protection claim, Father must establish that
HRS Chapter 586 imposes a classification on the basis of gender. 
State v. Tookes , 67 Haw. 608, 614, 699 P.2d 983, 987-88 (1985). 
Here, the statute on its face is gender-neutral:  it is available
to all victims of domestic violence, male or female.  Even if
Father based his claim on an allegedly discriminatory pattern in
the issuance of TROs in favor of women, he would have to show
such an overwhelming pattern of invidious discrimination that an
intent to discriminate could be inferred.  Id.  at 614, 699 P.2d
at 988.  Father has not asserted any evidentiary basis for
inferring such a pattern of discrimination.  See id. (holding
that prostitution statute did not violate equal protection where
it was gender-neutral and defendant failed to sustain evidentiary
burden of showing pattern of discriminatory enforcement).  HisFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
20/Father requests that we take judicial notice of the custody case,
UCCJ No. 98-0028.  Although appellate courts may, in their discretion, take
judicial notice of matters not presented to the trial court, Father has not
supplied the relevant records.  See Eli v. State , 63 Haw. 474, 478, 630 P.2d
113, 116 (1981).  We thus limit our review to the record in the instant case.
29conclusory allegations on this point are unsupported by the
record.
C. The Family Court Did Not Abuse its Discretion in
Issuing the Ex Parte TRO
Lastly, Father argues that the Family Court abused its
discretion in issuing the Ex Parte TRO.  Specifically, he
contends that the court clearly erred in finding that (1) Father
inflicted physical harm upon Minor; (2) Father threatened Minor
with further physical harm; (3) Father's actions did not
constitute parental discipline; and (4) Father's actions placed
Minor in immediate danger.  He asserts an overarching argument
that Mother filed the "bogus" Petition solely as a means to gain
the upper hand in an upcoming child custody hearing.20/ 
As these arguments largely concern factual findings, we
may only overturn them if the Family Court clearly erred.  In re
Doe, 95 Hawai i at 190, 20 P.3d at 623.  A finding of fact is
clearly erroneous if it is unsupported by substantial evidence in
the record or the appellate court is "left with a definite and
firm conviction that a mistake has been made."  Id.  (internal
quotation marks and citation omitted).  »
Here, Minor testified that on August 12, 2005, Father
struck her several times.  She described in detail the manner in
which he hit her, explaining that he tried to hit her face but
she blocked his hand before he could reach it.  She testified to
a second incident on August 25, when Father hit her on her arms
as she was covering her head.  She stated that Father then told
her, "Don't make me do that again . . . . Don't make me hit you FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
30again."  She testified that the argument occurred because she did
not want to talk with him at 11:00 p.m. on a school night.
Although Father offered a different account of what
happened, the Family Court acted within its exclusive province as
fact-finder in reconciling conflicting testimony.  State v.
Jenkins, 93 Hawai i 87, 101, 997 P.2d 13, 27 (2000).  It is not
the role of this court to weigh the credibility of witnesses. 
Id.  Here, Minor's testimony provides substantial evidence in
support of the Family Court's findings.  The Family Court did not
clearly err in finding that Father inflicted physical harm on
Minor and threatened her with further physical harm, and that his
actions were not calculated to promote Minor's welfare.»
Father also argues that the Family Court erred in
concluding that Minor was in "immediate danger," justifying the
issuance and continuation of the TRO.  The Petition alleged that
Minor was in immediate danger of further abuse because of
Father's "previous actions such as hitting me on Aug. 12th and
Aug. 25th, showing up at my school, and verbally abusing me."  
Father points out that the Petition was not filed until September
23, 2005, nearly a month after the last physical incident
occurred.  He maintains that because of the time lag, Minor could
not have been in immediate danger.  We disagree.  
In order to obtain an ex parte TRO, the petitioner need
not allege recent acts of abuse, but only " past act or acts of
abuse" or "threats of abuse" that make it probable that further
acts of abuse may be imminent.  HRS ÿÿÿÿ 586-3; 586-4(c) (emphasis
added).  In 1998, the Legislature abolished the requirement that
the petitioner allege recent acts of abuse in order to obtain an
ex parte TRO.  See 1998 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 172, § 2 at 642-43. 
It sought to provide judges with more discretion in granting
TROs, but cautioned that they should not issue TROs for
"incidents that are too remote in time," as "[i]ssuing
restraining orders for acts of abuse that occurred in the distantFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
21/Although the Family Court did not enter any specific findings as
to the September 16th incident, it concluded that "[t]he material allegations
of the petition have been proven." 
31past would be inconsistent with the purpose of temporary
restraining orders."  H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 578-98, in 1998
House Journal, at 1264.  The petitioner must allege past acts or
threats demonstrating a probability that further acts of abuse
"may be imminent."  HRS ÿÿ 586-4(c).  In determining whether
imminent abuse is probable, the Family Court should take into
account the severity, frequency, and freshness of the alleged
acts.  However, the statute does not impose a rigid time frame
for relief stemming from past acts.
Here, the Petition and testimony at the hearing alleged
two separate acts of physical abuse, both occurring under similar
circumstances when Minor was in Father's care and custody.  They
asserted that Father threatened further acts of physical harm.  
Finally, both the Petition and testimony concerned a third, more
recent act of psychological abuse that occurred on September 16,
2005, only a few days before the Petition was filed.21/  Taken as
a whole, the allegations support the Family Court's finding of
immediate danger.
In a similar case, the respondent to an ex parte TRO
raised a similar argument that "the applicant's claim of present
and immediate danger is undercut by the fact that she waited
seven hours to call the police on the night of the alleged threat
and seven days until seeking the ex parte order since this delay
belies any claim of imminent danger."  Pendleton , 1992 WL 75920,
at *7.  The primary allegation in the petition was the
respondent's implied threat to kill the petitioner.  Id. at *2. 
The court examined the nature of the threat in considering the
likelihood of violence.  Id. at *7.  It reasoned that although
the threat had not yet materialized, the danger remained FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
32"unabated until the time the ex parte order was sought and
beyond."  Id. 
Here, Father's alleged threat ("Don't make me hit you
again") was confined to a heated argument and was not as serious
as the respondent's death threat in Pendleton .  Nonetheless, the
threat, in conjunction with the two prior acts of physical harm
as well as the allegation of recent psychological abuse, gave
rise to a reasonable conclusion that the risk of further harm
persisted and that a period of separation was necessary to
prevent imminent harm.  Thus, the Family Court did not err in
issuing the Ex Parte TRO and allowing it to remain in force until
its expiration.

For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.
