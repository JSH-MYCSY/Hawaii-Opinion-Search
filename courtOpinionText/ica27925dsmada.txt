Defendants-Appellees
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 06-1-2)
 
ORDER OF DISMISSAL
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Margery K. Kekauoha-Alisa
 
(Kekauoha-Alisa) appeals from the Judgment, Writ of Possession
 
and Judgment for Possession, all entered on April 11, 2006, by
 
the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit (circuit court).1
 
During the pendency of this appeal, the United States 
Bankruptcy Court for the District of Hawai' i (Bankruptcy Court), 
before whom Kekauoha-Alisa had filed a petition for bankruptcy, ruled that the foreclosure sale that is the subject of this 
appeal was void, set aside the foreclosure sale, ordered that the 
subject property be reconveyed to Kekauoha-Alisa, and awarded 
attorneys' fees and costs to Kekauoha-Alisa. WM Specialty 
Mortgage LLC, Without Recourse (WM Specialty), Plaintiff-Appellee 
herein, purchaser of the property at the foreclosure sale and 
defendant in the adversary proceeding before the Bankruptcy 
Court, appealed the Bankruptcy Court's decision to the United

States Bankruptcy Appellate Panel for the Ninth Circuit (BAP) who
 
reversed the Bankruptcy Court's decision. Kekauoha-Alisa
 
appealed from the BAP's decision to the Court of Appeals for the
 
Ninth Circuit and, on March 26, 2012, the Ninth Circuit issued
 
its Opinion in which it affirmed the Bankruptcy Court's ruling
 
that the foreclosure sale was void, vacated the Bankruptcy
 
Court's award of damages and attorneys' fees and remanded for
 
findings on causation and damages and recalculation of attorneys'
 
fees. Kekauoha-Alisa's petition for rehearing was denied on
 
April 12, 2012.2
 
Given these events, we ordered the parties to the
 
instant appeal to file supplemental briefs addressing the
 
preclusive effect of the Ninth Circuit's decision. The parties
 
responded by filing their "Joint Supplemental Brief in Response
 
to April 18, 2012 Order," in which they agree that the Ninth
 
Circuit's opinion has collateral estoppel effect on the instant
 
appeal and urge this court to vacate the circuit court's order
 
granting summary judgment, judgment, writ of possession and
 
judgment for possession and to dismiss the instant appeal.
 
Based on the submission of the parties, the record, and
 
the applicable authority, we hereby dismiss this appeal without
 
prejudice to a subsequent motion filed with the circuit court to
 
vacate the judgment or dismiss the case.
