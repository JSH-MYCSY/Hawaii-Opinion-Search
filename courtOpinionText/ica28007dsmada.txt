  The Honorable Matthew S.K. Pyun presided.1NO. 28007
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
VOJTECH MALASEK, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
JESSICA NOLEN and ANTONIO ROLLY ORR,
Defendants-Appellees
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
SOUTH KOHALA DIVISION
(CIVIL NO. 3RC 04-1-071H)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By:  Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
Upon review of the record in this case, it appears that
we lack jurisdiction over Plaintiff-Appellant Vojtech Malasek's
(Malasek) appeal of (1) the judgment entered February 1, 2006, by
the District Court of the Third Circuit, South Kohala Division1
(district court) in favor of Defendants-Appellees Jessica Nolen
and Antonio Rolly Orr (Appellees) and (2) the June 13, 2006
order, which denied Malasek's motion to set aside the judgment.
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1(a) (Supp. 2006)
authorizes appeals to the intermediate court of appeals (ICA)
only from final judgments, orders, and decrees.  A judgment is
final and appealable when it "ends the litigation by fully
deciding all rights and liabilities of all parties, leaving
nothing further to be adjudicated[.]"  Casumpang v. ILWU, Local
142, 91 Hawai# i 425, 426, 984 P.2d 1251, 1252 (1999). 
Conversely, "an order is not final if the rights of a party
involved remain undetermined or if the matter is retained for
further action."  Cho v. State, 115 Hawai #i 373, 383, 168 P.3d
17, 27 (2007).NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
  DCRCP Rule 60 can be interpreted by analogy to HRCP Rule2
60.  See Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 94 Hawai# i 330, 337, 13
P.3d 1235, 1242 (2000)  (applying same standard of review to
application of HRCP 12(b)(1) and DCRCP 12 (b)(1) because the two
rules are substantially identical)
2The district court's February 1, 2006 judgment does not
adjudicate all of the parties' claims.  The February 1, 2006
judgment grants default judgment to Appellees on their
counterclaims and dismisses Malasek's "initial complaint for
rent."  It does not, however, resolve the claim for "[r]eplevin
of (12) paintings and other things" that Malasek alleges were
taken when Appellees moved out and that was also pleaded in the
complaint.  As such, under the judgment entered on February 1,
2006, Malasek's rights in regard to the artwork remain
undetermined.
The district court denied Malasek's motion to set aside
the default judgment, finding that Malasek failed to demonstrate
excusable neglect sufficient to invoke relief under Rule 60(b)(1)
of the District Court Rules of Civil Procedure (DCRCP).
A motion for post-judgment relief under DCRCP Rule
60(b), like a motion for reconsideration pursuant to Hawai# i
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 60(b) ,2 "is authorized only
in situations involving final judgments."  Cho, 115 Hawai
#i at
382, 168 P.3d at 26 (quoting Crown Props., Inc. v. Fin. Sec. Life
Ins., 6 Haw. App. 105, 112, 712 P.2d 504, 509 (1985) (internal
quotation marks omitted) and citing Tradewinds Hotel, Inc. v.
Cochran, 8 Haw. App. 256, 262, 799 P.2d 60, 65 (1990)).  "Indeed,
by its terms, Rule 60(b) only applies to a 'final judgment,
order, or proceeding.'"  Id.
Without the entry of a final judgment, post-judgment
relief under DCRCP Rule 60(b) is not available.  Id. at 383, 168
P.3d at 27.  Because the February 1, 2006 default judgment was
not a final judgment, the June 13, 2006 order is an interlocutoryNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
3order.  Under HRS ยง 641-1(a), the ICA lacks jurisdiction to
review the order.
Therefore,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number
28007 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
