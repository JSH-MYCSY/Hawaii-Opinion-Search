NOS. 28289 & 28694
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
HEINRICH ALEXANDER RIETHBROCK, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
MARION BARBARA LANGE, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D NO. 04-1-0147)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Heinrich Alexander Riethbrock
 
("Riethbrock") appeals from the October 26, 2006 Order Denying
 
Pending Motions ("Pending Motions Order"), entered in the Family
 Court of the Second Circuit ("Family Court").
1 The case was
 
assigned appellate case number 28289. Riethbrock subsequently
 appealed from the Family Court's July 24, 2007 Order Pertaining
 to Request for Attorney's Fees ("Fees Order"). The second case
 was assigned appellate case number 28694. On July 6, 2011, the
 two cases were consolidated for disposition under case number
 28289.
 
On appeal, Riethbrock contends that the Family Court
 
committed reversible error (1) in denying his motion for a stay
 of orders to sell the property and home located at 241 Hiwalani
 Loop in Pukalani, on the island of Maui ("Pukalani Property") and
 for dismissal of the action, (2) in authorizing escrow to release
 $100,000 of the net sale proceeds from the Pukalani Property to
 his ex-wife, Defendant-Appellee Marion Barbara Lange ("Lange")
 and her former attorney, and (3) in ordering him to pay Lange's

attorney's fees and costs totaling $73,838.80.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 affirm the Family Court's decisions and address Riethbrock's
 points of error as follows:
 
(1) "The time limit specified in [Hawaii Revised 
Statutes ("HRS")] § 580-56(d) pertains to the family court's jurisdiction to resolve the property division issue, and to decide how the property of the parties will be distributed." Richter v. Richter, 108 Hawai' i 504, 506-07, 122 P.3d 284, 286-87 
(App. 2005) (citation omitted). HRS § 580-56(d), however, does not divest the Family Court of jurisdiction to enforce timely made property division orders. Id. at 507, 122 P.3d at 287. 
In his first point of error in appellate case number
 
28289, Riethbrock contends that the Family Court was barred from
 proceeding with the sale of the Pukalani Property more than a
 year after issuing the parties' divorce decree because the
 parties' marital property had not been finally divided and
 distributed as necessary under Boulton v. Boulton, 69 Haw. 1, 730
 P.2d 338 (1986) and HRS § 580-56(d). The Family Court, however,
 held that it had timely divided the property and, implicitly,
 that this was sufficient under Boulton:
 
Although not explicitly stated in the Court's June 8, 2006
Order, it is implicit that the Court was dividing the real
estate on the basis that each party would receive a one-half
share of the net sale proceeds of the property, because the
Court ordered that Mr. Riethbrock's one-half share of the
 proceeds would initially be placed in a trust fund for past
and future child support payments. Therefore, the Court has
finally divided the property within the one-year period as
required by HRS § 580-56(d).
 
After review of the entire record, we concur with the Family
 
Court.
 
As Lange's interest in the Pukalani Property and the 
methodology by which she would receive that interest had been timely determined, the Family Court did not err in denying Riethbrock's October 5, 2006 motion to stay sale of the property. Torres v. Torres, 100 Hawai' i 397, 410-12, 60 P.3d 798, 811-13 
(2002) (divorce decree amended more than one year after decree

first issued for purposes of perfecting ex-wife's entitlement to
 
her fifty percent interest in ex-husband's retirement pension
 benefits did not violate HRS § 580-56 as it did not affect ex­husband's entitlement to his share of the retirement benefits). 
Consequently, as well, the Family Court did not err in denying
 Riethbrock's motion to dismiss.
 
(2) Riethbrock's second point of error in appellate 
case number 28289 concerning the January 23, 2007 Order Granting Ex Parte Motion Releasing Defendant's Funds From Escrow arose two months after the notice of appeal was filed. As a result, we lack jurisdiction to further address the point. Cook v. Surety 
Life Ins., Co., 79 Hawai' i 403, 409, 903 P.2d 708, 714 (App. 
1995) (When a party appeals from a single order, "this court will only consider other orders which were preliminary rulings upon which the subject Order was predicated or were part of the series of orders which collectively led to that Order."). 
(3) In appellate case number 28964, Riethbrock asserts
 
that the Family Court committed reversible error by ordering him
 to pay Lange's attorney's fees and costs totaling $73,838.80.
2
 
Specifically, Riethbrock argues that the Family Court erred by
 not entering the required findings of fact with respect to bad
 faith, by failing to comply with the requirements of HRS § 580­47, and because the order was "in violation of judicial estoppel
 rules."

 The Fees Order provided, in relevant part, that:
 
After review of the submissions by the parties, the
Court enters the following orders:
 
1. With regard to the requested amount of $65,928.51,
Plaintiff shall pay to Defendant the amount of $65,928.51.
 
2. Plaintiff also shall pay to Defendant the amounts
of $6,104.13 for fees and costs from April 18, 2006 to June
5, 2006, and $1,806.16 in fees and costs from August 7, 2006
to August 16, 2006.
 
While a large portion of the $65,928.51 is
attributable to bad faith and abusive litigation tactics by
Plaintiff, the Court finds additionally that this award is
appropriate pursuant to the factors set forth in HRS 580-47
as argued by Defendant in his submissions.

1. Bad Faith
 
"[I]n order to facilitate a meaningful and more
 
efficient appellate review, an order imposing sanctions should
 
set forth findings that describe, with reasonable specificity,
 the perceived misconduct (such as harassment or bad faith
 conduct), as well as the appropriate sanctioning authority." 
Enos v. Pacific Transfer & Warehouse, Inc., 79 Hawai' i 452, 459, 
903 P.2d 1273, 1280 (1995) (citation omitted). If the sanction
 order does not contain specific findings, we review the entire
 record for an abuse of discretion. Id. 
 
In the Fees Order, the Family Court referenced Lange's
 
recitation of Riethbrock's misconduct advanced in her notice of
 submission filed February 9, 2007, in support of her request for
 fees. The Family Court's explicit reference to and implicit
 adoption of the enumerated examples of misconduct is sufficient
 to establish that the court did not abuse its discretion in
 determining bad faith.

In determining the fair and reasonable amount of

 At least two subsections are implicated.
 
(a) Upon granting a divorce, or thereafter . . . the
court may make any further orders as shall appear just and
equitable . . . . (4) allocating, as between the parties,
the responsibility for the payment of . . . attorney's fees,
costs, and expenses incurred by each party by reason of the
divorce. In making these further orders, the court shall
take into consideration: the respective merits of the
parties, the relative abilities of the parties, the
condition in which each party will be left by the divorce,
the burdens imposed upon either party for the benefit of the
children of the parties, and all other circumstances of the
 
case. . . .
 
. . . .
 
(f) Attorney's fees and costs. The court . . . may
make such orders requiring either party to pay or contribute
to the payment of the attorney's fees, costs, and expenses
of the other party relating to such motion and hearing as
shall appear just and equitable after consideration of the
respective merits of the parties, the relative abilities of
the parties, the economic condition of each party at the
time of the hearing, the burdens imposed upon either party
for the benefit of the children of the parties, and all
other circumstances of the case.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
attorney's fees, the court should consider the financial ability
 
of the parties and the amount necessary for the efficient
 prosecution or defense of the action. Farias v. Farias, 58 Haw.
 
227, 233-34, 566 P.2d 1104, 1109 (1977) ("The trial court
 exercised its discretion, at least by implication, and determined
 that appellee should pay the attorney's fees incurred by
 appellant in connection with this divorce action.") 
The Family Court stated that its decision was based in 
part on the factors set out in HRS § 580-47. "HRS § 580-47 confers broad discretion on the family court in granting an award of attorney's fees to one spouse. An award of litigation expenses is within the sound discretion of the family court, subject only to the standard that it is 'fair and reasonable.'" Markham v. Markham, 80 Hawai' i 274, 287-88, 909 P.2d 602, 615-16 
(App. 1996) (footnote omitted). 
Riethbrock failed to establish that the Family Court 
abused its discretion in awarding Lange the requested attorney's fees. The Family Court's award contains an inherent determination that the resulting award was fair and reasonable. Sufficient billing detail was provided to justify the court's award. In sum, we cannot say that the Fees Order was not fair and reasonable. E.g., Markham, 80 Hawai' i at 288, 909 P.2d at 
616.
 
3. Judicial Estoppel
 
Riethbrock did not establish any relationship between 
the $41,000.00 in fees that Lange's counsel later compromised and the $73,838.80 requested and ordered here. As such, Lange's position with respect to the alleged debt of $73,838.80 is not clearly inconsistent with her position concerning the $41,000.00 debt. Lee v. Puamana Cmty. Ass'n, 109 Hawai' i 561, 576, 128 P.3d 
874, 889 (2006). In addition, neither Lange nor her counsel persuaded any court to accept the $20,500.00 settlement. As such, there was no inconsistent position and no perception that "the first or the second court was misled." Id. (quoting New 
Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 750-51 (2001)). 
Since two of the factors that would justify judicial
 
estoppel are not present, the Family Court is not judicially

estopped from awarding attorney's fees and costs that it deemed
 
fair and reasonable.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the October 26, 2006 Order
 
Denying Pending Motions, and the July 24, 2007 Order Pertaining
 To Request For Attorney's Fees entered in the Family Court of the
 Second Circuit are affirmed.
