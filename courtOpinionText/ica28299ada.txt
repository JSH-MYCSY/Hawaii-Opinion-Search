OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I

CATHERINE CURTIS, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
JEFF DORN, Defendant-Appellant
 
NO. 28299
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 03-1-0103)
 
JUNE 17, 2010
 
NAKAMURA, C.J., REIFURTH AND GINOZA, JJ.
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY REIFURTH, J.
 
This case involves the partition under chapter 668,
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes, of improved real property held by an
 
unmarried couple as tenants in common. Plaintiff-Appellee
 Catherine Curtis (Curtis), the cotenant in possession (COTIP)
 since January 1994, wishes to purchase the interest held by
 Defendant-Appellant Jeff Dorn (Dorn), the cotenant out of
 possession (COTOP), but the parties cannot agree on a purchase
 price. On appeal, we hold that a COTOP who was not ousted from
 the property, but from whom a COTIP seeks contribution for unpaid
 maintenance and improvements, may be entitled to offset a
 proportionate share of the property's rental value during the
 COTIP's occupancy of the property.
 
Dorn appeals from the November 8, 2006 Second Amended
 
Judgment filed in the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit (circuit
 
1
 in favor of Curtis.  The Second Amended Judgment ordered court)Dorn to transfer to Curtis his interest in the home that Curtis and Dorn owned as tenants in common in K
Ilauea, Hawai 'i, on the 
island of Kaua 'i (KIlauea property), and directed Curtis to pay 
$51,132.87 to Dorn. 
On appeal, Dorn argues that the circuit court
 
reversibly erred by not crediting him with the rental value of
 
1

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the KIlauea property during the period that he was out of
 
possession. Dorn also challenges several of the circuit court's
 
amended findings of fact and conclusions of law.
 
The circuit court determined that it was precluded as a
 
matter of law from considering whether Dorn was entitled to an
 offset for imputed rental income because Dorn had not been ousted
 from the property. We disagree with this legal conclusion. 
Thus, remand is appropriate so that the circuit court may apply
 the principles of law adopted herein in exercising its
 discretion.
 
For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that a
 
COTOP who has not been ousted from the property may nevertheless
 be entitled to credit for a proportionate share of imputed rental
 income as an offset against a COTIP's claim for unpaid
 maintenance and improvement contributions. As a result, we
 vacate the judgment and remand the case to the circuit court.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
A. The Proceeding
 
On July 29, 2003, Curtis filed a complaint with the
 
circuit court requesting a termination of the "joint venture
 
and/or partnership" entered into by Curtis and Dorn in order to
 purchase the K
Ilauea property, and "a declaratory judgment of the
 
amount due to [Dorn] from [Curtis], if any, for his share of the
 [K
Ilauea] property." The complaint explains that "[s]ince the
 
purpose of the venture was to purchase a residence for the
 parties, [Curtis] requests that she maintain the residence for
 herself and the daughter of the parties and pay [Dorn] the amount
 due, if any, for his partnership interest."
 
B. The Property
 
On June 28, 1993, Curtis and Dorn, who were never
 
married to one another, entered into a joint venture through
 
which they purchased, as tenants in common, the Hurricane Iniki­damaged K
Ilauea property for $171,000. The parties made a down
 
payment of $36,000, of which Curtis contributed $34,000 and Dorn
 $2,000. The balance of the purchase price was financed by the
 
2
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
seller. 
Curtis, Dorn, and their daughter (Daughter) moved into
 
the KIlauea property and Curtis and Dorn shared the mortgage
 
payments, insurance, and real estate taxes equally. The couple's
 
relationship deteriorated and Dorn moved out in December 1993. 
In June 1994, Curtis and Dorn obtained a $180,000
 
mortgage loan on the K Ilauea property, paid closing costs and the
 
balance due to the seller of the K Ilauea property, and split
 
equally the remaining $36,000. 
In 1999, Dorn purchased another residence as "a first
 
time home buyer" in the Kilauea Estates (Estates property) under
 the "Kilauea Estates Home Buyer Loan Program" (Estates loan
 program). Although living at the Estates property, Dorn stored
 personal items such as generators, surfboards, tools, etc., at
 the K
Ilauea property, and would often return to the house to see
 
Daughter.
 
Multiple estimates of the K Ilauea property's sale and
 
rental value were introduced at trial. Appraiser Dennis Nakahara
 conducted an in-person appraisal at the request of both parties
 and estimated that the property was worth $540,000. Appraiser
 Jose Diogo estimated, without entering the residence, that the
 K
Ilauea property was worth approximately $685,000. In a
 
September 29, 2005 letter, realtor Peter Tegan stated, without
 viewing the property, that he would be "comfortable" listing it
 for $740,000. He also testified at trial that the property's
 current rental value would be between $1,800 and $2,100 per
 month.
2 Curtis' contractor, Eugene Lopez, testified that the
 
interior and exterior of the property required extensive repairs.
 
C. KIlauea Property Investment, Expenses And Revenues
1. Equity
 
Curtis and Dorn purchased the K Ilauea property for
 
$171,000, investing $34,000 and $2,000 respectively as a cash
 down payment, and leaving them mutually responsible for the
 
2
 Tegan's rental value testimony was presented "as a lay person" and
not an expert. 
3
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
$135,000 unpaid balance to the seller. As a result, the circuit
 
court calculated Curtis' equity interest as 59.4%, and Dorn's
 equity interest as 40.6%. The amount owing on the mortgage at
 the time of trial was $155,148.38.
 
2. Contributions To Property
 
In January 1994, the month after Dorn moved out, Curtis
 
began paying the monthly mortgage payment of $1,258.59. She
 continued paying monthly payments for the next 11 years and 10
 months, for a total of $178,719.78. Dorn did not make any
 mortgage payments during this period. 
In addition to mortgage payments, the circuit court
 
found that, from 1994 to 2004, Curtis contributed $23,219.94
 toward home insurance, property taxes, and ongoing home expenses,
 whereas Dorn contributed a total of $1,421.00 during that same
 period. Finally, the circuit court found that Curtis and Dorn
 had contributed $6,862.00 and $29,476.00, respectively, to "fix
 up the property after purchase." 
D. Trial
 
The non-jury trial began on November 2, 2005. Curtis
 
testified that after Dorn moved out of the K
Ilauea property, Dorn
 
did not demand or ask that he be allowed to return to the house
 
and did not file any "legal proceedings" to obtain possession. 
Curtis also testified that the locks on the house had not been
 changed, and that Dorn had left voluntarily. Moreover, Dorn
 never requested that Curtis pay rent. 
Exploring the circumstances surrounding Dorn's
 
departure, Curtis testified that, over time, she and Dorn "just
 didn't get along," and that the relationship had become such that
 they "could not reside together in peace and . . . concord."
 Nevertheless, Curtis contended that Dorn could have remained at
 the K
Ilauea property in the home's third bedroom.
 
When asked about his relationship with Curtis, Dorn
 
testified that he and Curtis had "scuff[led] in the street in
 front of the house" and that Curtis had once reported him to the
 police. Dorn further testified that the relationship had become
 strained and bitter, so he "left."

  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
E. Findings Of Fact And Conclusions of Law
 
On November 22, 2005, the circuit court issued Findings
 
of Fact (FOFs) and Conclusions of Law (COLs), and an order
 
requiring Curtis to pay Dorn $50,882.87 for his interest in the
 K
Ilauea property, and ordering Dorn to transfer his interest in
 
the property to Curtis upon payment. The circuit court concluded
 that Dorn had not been ousted, that Curtis' possession was
 amicable, and that Curtis was not accountable to Dorn for the
 reasonable value of Curtis' occupancy. 
F. Motion For Reconsideration
 
On December 2, 2005, Dorn filed a motion for a new
 
trial or other relief pursuant to HRCP 59 and for amendment of
 
FOFs and COLs pursuant to HRCP 52. The motion focused on the
 court's alleged error in not allowing Dorn an offset of amounts
 reflecting the value of Curtis' use and occupation of the K
Ilauea
 
property while Dorn was out of possession. The motion also
 challenged the court's conclusion that Dorn be credited for
 $29,476.00 in rehabilitation expenses despite Dorn's contention
 that he had demonstrated entitlement to "about $50,000." 
On December 12, 2005, the circuit court issued the
 
Judgment, the terms of which were consistent with the
 November 22, 2005 FOFs and COLs. On December 21, 2005, the
 circuit court issued the Amended Findings of Fact and Conclusions
 of Law (Amended FOFs and COLs).
3
 
G. Amended FOFs and COLs; Judgment
 
The circuit court concluded that the parties were
 
entitled to a termination of their joint venture, and that Curtis
 
should have the opportunity to purchase Dorn's interest in the
 K
Ilauea property. The circuit court further concluded that
 
Curtis was a cotenant and, as such, was not accountable to Dorn
 
3
 The Amended FOFs and COLs differed from the initial FOFs and COLs
 
in three principal respects. First, it included a FOF noting that Dorn does
not seek to be reimbursed or credited for the rental value of Daughter's
occupancy of the property. Second, it deleted a FOF concerning repair
expenses incurred by Curtis. Third, it explained the basis for the court's
calculation of the parties' contribution to repairing the property after
purchase. 
5
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
for the reasonable value of her occupancy. Ouster was
 
unavailable as a theory under which to receive credit for the
 value of Curtis' tenancy, the circuit court held, because "[t]he
 presumption is that possession is amicable," and "[p]roof of
 ouster between tenants in common must be of the most satisfactory
 nature and this burden was not met." 
The circuit court explained that it would use the
 
analysis employed by the Nevada Supreme Court in Sack v. Tomlin,
 871 P.2d 298 (Nev. 1994), to determine the division of equity. 
First, the circuit court determined the current equity in the
 home by taking the Nakahara appraisal value of $540,000, and
 subtracted the amount of $155,148.38 that was owing on the
 mortgage, leaving a total of $384,851.62 in equity. 
Second, the circuit court calculated each party's
 
equity interest by dividing the original mortgage amount by two
 (i.e. $135,000 ÷ 2 or $67,500), then adding to that the amount of
 down-payment contributed (i.e. Dorn: $67,500 + $2,000 = $69,500 
4
;
Curtis: $67,500 + $34,000 = $101,500), and dividing that amount
 by the original purchase price (i.e., Dorn: $69,500 ÷ $171,000 =
 40.6%; Curtis: $101,500 ÷ $171,000 = 59.4%), then multiplying
 those percentages by the $384,851.62 of total equity in the home. 
Curtis' share of equity was $228,601.26, and Dorn's was
 $156,139.73.
 
Third, the circuit court considered "any claims that
 
one party may have against the other" (i.e., any difference in
 the parties' contributions to the property). The court appears
 to start from the implicit assumption that the parties were
 equally responsible for contributions to property, and that any
 variation from that equality should be addressed as an offset to
 the equity share calculated above. 
The court calculated each
 
party's contributions to the property, including mortgage
 payments, the down payment, insurance, taxes, home expenses, and
 money spent on home repairs, and determined that Curtis had
 
4
 The circuit court's calculation in the Amended FOFs and COLs
 
reflects Dorn's share as $68,500. The error is inconsequential, however, as
the subsequently derived equity percentage of 40.6% is mathematically correct
(as though the number $69,500 had been used).
 
6
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
contributed $242,901.72, while Dorn had contributed $32,888.00;
 
leaving Curtis with excess contributions of $210,013.72. 
In order to equalize the parties' positions, the
 
circuit court divided the difference by two and concluded that
 Dorn owed Curtis $105,006.86 to balance the contributions. The
 court then subtracted that amount from Dorn's equity ($156,139.73
 -$105,006.86), and determined that Dorn was entitled to
 
$51,132.87 for his share of the K
Iilauea property. 
The circuit court ordered Curtis to pay $51,132.87 to
 
Dorn within sixty days, and Dorn to then convey his interest in
 the K
Ilauea property to Curtis. The Second Amended Judgment was
 
entered on November 8, 2006.
 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
FOFs and COLs of the Circuit Court
 
"In this jurisdiction, a trial court's FOFs are subject 
to the clearly erroneous standard of review. An FOF is clearly 
erroneous when, despite evidence to support the finding, the appellate court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed." Chun v. Bd. of Trs. of the 
Employees' Ret. Sys. of the State of Hawai
'i, 106 Hawai 'i 416, 
430, 106 P.3d 339, 353 (2005) (internal quotation marks, citations, and ellipses omitted) (quoting Allstate Ins. Co. v. Ponce, 105 Hawai
'i 445, 453, 99 P.3d 96, 104 (2004)). "An FOF is 
also clearly erroneous when the record lacks substantial evidence to support the finding. [The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has] defined 
'substantial evidence' as credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion." Leslie v. Estate of Tavares, 91 Hawai
'i 394, 399, 984 P.2d 1220, 1225 (1999) 
(internal quotation marks and citations omitted) (quoting State v. Kotis, 91 Hawai
'i 319, 328, 984 P.2d 78, 87 (1999)). 
COLs, on the other hand, are not binding on an
 
appellate court and are freely reviewable for correctness under
 the right/wrong standard.
 
[The appellate court] ordinarily reviews COLs under the
right/wrong standard. Thus, a COL that is supported by the
 
7
     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
trial court's FOFs and that reflects an application of the
correct rule of law will not be overturned. However, a COL
that presents mixed questions of fact and law is reviewed
under the clearly erroneous standard because the court's
conclusions are dependent upon the facts and circumstances
of each individual case.
 
Chun, 106 Hawai 'i at 430, 106 P.3d at 353 (internal quotation 
marks, citations, and brackets omitted) (quoting Ponce, 105 
Hawai'i at 453, 99 P.3d at 104).
Equitable Relief
 
"The relief granted by a court in equity is 
discretionary and will not be overturned on review unless the circuit court abused its discretion by issuing a decision that clearly exceeds the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of the appellant." Aickin v. Ocean View Invs. Co., Inc., 84 Hawai
'i 
447, 453, 935 P.2d 992, 998 (1997) (internal quotation marks, citation, and brackets omitted). 
III. POINTS OF ERROR
 
Dorn asserts that "[t]he trial court erred in not
 
finding that a [COTOP] . . . is entitled to rental value of the
 
[COTIP] when the [COTIP] . . . seeks reimbursement . . . for
 expenditures made in maintaining the property."
 
Furthermore, Dorn challenges the following Amended
 
FOFs:
 
6. DORN does not seek to be reimbursed or credited
 
for the rental value, if any, of [Daughter]'s occupancy of
the property as he acknowledges his parental responsibility.
 
7. DORN has made no written demand and has filed no
 
action requesting possession of the property or alleging he
has been denied use of the property. DORN has made no
 verbal demand requesting possession of the property or
alleging he has been denied use of the property.
 
. . .
 
19. DORN contributed $
 29,476.00 [ 5
 ] to fixing up the
5
 FOF 19 included a footnote stating that, "[t]his is the total amount
stipulated to by the parties as reflected in Exhibits D-A and D-B 14, plus ½ of
the cost of the cabinets, carpet and drywall."
 
8
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
property after purchase and CURTIS contributed $6,862.00 [ 6
]
to fixing up the property after purchase.
 
. . .
 
26. The Court finds the value of the property to be
$540,000.00
, based on the jointly agreed upon, in-person
appraisal by Dennis Nakahara.
 
Dorn also challenges the following Amended COLs, in
 
relevant part:
 
3. CURTIS is a cotenant of the property and is not
accountable to DORN for the reasonable value of her
 
occupancy. 
4. Mere occupation of the property by CURTIS does not
constitute ouster. The presumption is that possession is
amicable. The use by DORN to store property and the
purchase by DORN of another residence in 1999 shows CURTIS's
[sic] possession is with his agreement. Proof of ouster
 between tenants in common must be of the most satisfactory
nature and this burden was not met. 
5. The division of equity should be based on the percentage
of contributions of the parties toward the purchase price adjusted
by their subsequent contribution. The Court elects to use the
 analysis contained in Sack v. Tomlin, 871 P.2d 298 (Nev. 1994).
The Sack court reviewed the case law and found that the equity
should be divided by first determining the respective ownership
interests of the parties, which determines the share of each party
of the net proceeds. Next, any claims that one party may have
against the other should be considered.
 
(Citations omitted).
 
Dorn raises two final points of error, contending that
 
(1) he sought reimbursement or credit for the rental value of the
 
KIlauea property, but it was denied by the circuit court, and (2)
 
he contributed approximately $50,000 to the K Ilauea property
 
after it was purchased, not $29,476.00 as determined by the
 circuit court. 
IV. DISCUSSION
 
Partition is an action in equity, and we review that
 
action under the abuse of discretion standard. Kimura v. Kamalo,
 
106 Hawai
'i 501, 506, 107 P.3d 430, 435 (2005) (citing AIG Hawai 'i 
Ins. Co., Inc. v. Bateman, 82 Hawai 'i 453, 457, 923 P.2d 395, 399 
(1996)). In partition actions, the circuit court has the power,

among other things:
 
(4)	 To cause the property to be equitably divided between
the parties according to their respective
proportionate interests therein . . . .
 
. . . .
 
(7)	 To exercise any other power pertaining to a circuit
court in a civil action.
 
Haw. Rev. Stat. § 668-7 (1993).
 
A.	 Appellant Claims Entitlement To A Credit Reflecting An
Offset For The Rental Value of Appellee's Occupancy
 
The circuit court, citing to Haw. C. & S. Co. v. 
Waikapu S. Co., 9 Haw. 75 (Hawai 'i Prov. Gov. 1893), concluded 
that Curtis was not accountable to Dorn for the reasonable value 
of her occupancy. 
The majority rule is that, in the absence of an
 
agreement to pay or ouster by the COTIP, a tenant in common is
 not liable, because of such occupancy alone, to a COTOP for rent
 or the use and occupation of the premises. See, e.g., De Mello
 
v. De Mello, 24 Haw. 675, 676 (Hawai
'i Terr. 1919); Sack v. 
Tomlin, 871 P.2d 298, 306 (Nev. 1994). The rule is premised on
 the rights of cotenants to occupy the premises as one of the
 incidents of a tenancy in common.
 
As between tenants in common where all are entitled to the
 
possession, the intent with which possession is taken is
material, for a stranger having no title may enter land and
exercise acts of ownership over it and leave little room to
doubt that he thereby intends to oust the true owner. But a
 co-tenant may enter the whole or any part of the common
estate as he has legal right to do, and the presumption of
law is, when nothing more is done, that he intends to do
nothing beyond the assertion of his right.
 
Haw. C. & S. Co., 9 Haw. at 80.
 
Dorn contends that an exception from the rule is
 
warranted because (1) he was "constructively ousted" from the
 
KIlauea property, and (2) Curtis seeks contribution from Dorn for
 
funds expended for maintenance or betterment of the property.
1.	 Appellant was not ousted
 
Dorn contends that the circuit court erred in not
 
awarding him the rental value of Curtis' occupancy of the K Ilauea
 
10
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
property because he was "constructively ousted."7 Specifically, 
Dorn contends that he was constructively ousted from the K Ilauea 
property because his relationship with Curtis "had become so 
strained and bitter that the two could not reside together in peace and concord[.]" Hawai
'i has not explicitly adopted or 
applied the concept of "constructive ouster," and we determine no need to do so in light of our analysis. 
The circuit court does not explicitly state that Dorn
 
was not ousted. We read Amended COLs 3 and 4 together, however,
 as implicitly reaching that conclusion, and we hold that the
 circuit court did not err in concluding that Dorn was not ousted.
 
The circuit court is correct that mere occupation of 
the property by Curtis does not constitute ouster. Hawai
'i law 
does not assume that a vacating cotenant has been ousted. In disputes between cotenants, there is a presumption that the COTIP "does not occupy the premises adversely to his cotenants but in common with them." Redfearn v. Kuhia, 53 Haw. 378, 381, 494 P.2d 
562, 564 (1972). "This presumption may be overcome only by conduct of one cotenant which constitutes an ouster or disseisin of the other cotenants." Id. 
The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has defined ouster as the 
"wrongful dispossession or exclusion from real property of a party who is entitled to the possession." Haw. C. & S. Co., 9 
Haw. at 80. In discussing ouster in the context of adverse possession, the Court has held that "ouster must be (1) actual, meaning a physical dispossession[,] or (2) its equivalent: a demand for possession by the cotenant out of possession and a refusal by the cotenant claiming by reason of adverse possession." Redfearn, 53 Haw. at 381-82, 494 P.2d at 564 
(internal quotation marks omitted).
 The record clearly shows that Dorn was not physically
 
dispossessed of the K
Ilauea property, nor did he make a demand
 
7
 The Hawai' i Supreme Court has held that when a COTOP is ousted, he
or she is entitled to "something for the exclusive use and occupation of the
premises" by the COTIP, but even that amount is ultimately a matter of equity.
Nahaolelua v. Kaaahu, 10 Haw. 662, 666-67 (Hawai' i Rep. 1897) ("The amount of
the compensation to be allowed for the use and occupation is . . . entirely
uncertain."). 
11
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
for possession, much less was there ever a demand for possession
 
that was refused. To support his claim of ouster, Dorn cites to
 cases that recognize "constructive ouster" in the marital
 dissolution context. For, example, Dorn cites to Olivas v.
 Olivas, 780 P.2d 640 (N.M. Ct. App. 1989), wherein the Court of
 Appeals of New Mexico applied the concept of "constructive
 ouster" in lieu of "actual ouster." The court explained the
 rationale for employing "constructive ouster" in the marital
 dissolution context, stating:
 
Applying the notion of constructive ouster in the
marital context is simply another way of saying that when
the emotions of a divorce make it impossible for spouses to
continue to share the marital residence pending a property
division, the spouse who-often through mutual
agreement-therefore departs the residence may be entitled to
rent from the remaining spouse. . . . .
 
Common law precedents support the proposition that the
remaining spouse should pay rent to the cotenant when both
cannot be expected to live together on the property. For
example, when it is impractical for all cotenants to occupy
the premises jointly, it is unnecessary that those claiming
rent from the cotenant in possession first demand the right
to move in and occupy the premises.
 
Id. at 643 (emphasis added). The Olivas court, however,
 
concluded that the appellant-ex-husband was not ousted, but
 rather that he voluntarily left the home. Id. at 644. 
Hawai
'i courts have not recognized the concept of 
"constructive ouster." In describing ouster, however, the
 Hawai
'i Supreme Court has stated that: 
An ouster is the wrongful dispossession or exclusion from
real property of a party who is entitled to the possession.
. . . There must be stronger evidence to prove that one
tenant has ousted another, than to prove that a person
having no right to the possession has ousted the owner. The
 proof of ouster between tenants in common ought to be of the
 
most satisfactory nature. The law will deem the possession
amicable until the tenant out of possession has in some
method been notified that it has become hostile. 
Haw. C. & S. Co., 9 Haw. at 80 (emphasis added). Thus, as the
 
circuit court correctly noted, proof of ouster must be of a "most
 satisfactory nature."
 
Here, although the circuit court heard testimony from
 
both Curtis and Dorn that they could no longer reside in peace
 and concord, there was also testimony that Dorn could have moved
 into the K
Ilauea property's third bedroom, that at all times Dorn
 
12
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
had personal possessions stored at the property, that Dorn would
 
visit the property to see Daughter, and that Dorn bought another
 home in 1999 that required him to stay at that property. Thus,
 it cannot be said that the circuit court heard evidence of such a
 "satisfactory nature" that it would overcome the presumption that
 Curtis occupied the K
Ilauea property in a permissive manner. Id. 
Accordingly, the record supports the circuit court's implicit
 conclusion that Dorn was not ousted from the K
Ilauea property. 
2.	 The fact that the COTOP was not ousted does not
 
preclude a defensive rental offset
 
The general rule of cotenancy, adopted by the Hawai 'i 
Supreme Court, holds that a COTIP is not obligated for rent to a
 
COTOP unless there is an ouster or an agreement holding
 otherwise:
 
The prevailing doctrine, which we adopt, is that where one
tenant in common uses and occupies the whole of the common
property without excluding his cotenants and without any
demand from them for possession, and refusal on his part, in
the absence of any agreement to pay rent, he is not liable
to his cotenants for the use and occupation of the common
property, and since the possession of one joint tenant, or
tenant in common, is the possession of all, and all are
equally entitled to the use and enjoyment of the property,
it follows as a general rule that one tenant cannot maintain
an action at law against his cotenant in respect of the
common property unless he has been disseized or ousted
therefrom.
 
De Mello, 24 Haw. at 676; see Lanigir v. Arden, 450 P.2d 148,
 
149-50 (Nev. 1969); Williams v. Sinclair Refining Co., 47 P.2d
 910, 912 (N.M. 1935) ("[I]t is a well-settled principle of the
 common law that the mere occupation by a tenant of the entire
 estate does not render him liable to his co-tenant for the use
 and occupation of any part of the common property."). 
It is also commonly recognized, however, that a COTOP
 
may request rental reimbursement as an offset when a COTIP
 affirmatively seeks contribution from the COTOP for improvement
 or maintenance expenditures made by the COTIP. "When a [COTIP]
 seeks contribution for amounts expended in the improvement or
 preservation of the property, that claim may be offset by [the
 COTOP] by the reasonable rental value of the use of the property
 by the [COTIP] to the extent it has exceeded his or her

proportionate share of ownership." Adkins v. Adkins, 595 So.2d
 
1032, 1035 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1992); see 20 Am. Jur. 2d
 
Cotenancy and Joint Ownership §§ 51, 57 (2005). 
Many jurisdictions allow COTOPs a defensive offset
 
against both maintenance-related and improvement-related
 contributions in non-ouster cases.
8 E.g., Esteves v. Esteves,
 
775 A.2d 163, 165 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2001); Lanigir, 450
 P.2d at 149-50; Clark v. Dady, 131 S.W.3d 382, 390 (Mo. Ct. App.
 2004); Janik v. Janik, 474 N.E.2d 1054, 1058 (Ind. Ct. App.
 1985); Gilleland v. Meadows, 351 S.W.2d 656, 658 (Tex. Civ. App.
 1961); Fundaburk v. Cody, 72 So.2d 710, 718 (Ala. 1954); Henry v.
 Steward, 250 S.W.2d 527, 528-30 (Mo. 1952); Winn v. Winn, 269
 N.W. 376 (Neb. 1936). 
Under this apportioned rental offset rule, even though
 
a COTOP cannot seek the rental value of a cotenant's possession
 of the property "at law," see De Mello, 24 Haw. at 676, when a
 COTIP invokes equity to obtain improvement-related or
 maintenance-related contributions from a cotenant, "the court, as
 incidental to the granting of such relief and by way of adjusting
 the rights of the parties, may charge the claimant, defensively,
 with at least a part of the reasonable value of his occupancy or
 use[.]" Hunter v. Schultz, 49 Cal. Rptr. 315, 320 (Cal. Dist.
 
Ct. App. 1966) (quoting 51 A.L.R.2d 388, 454).

We concur with those jurisdictions and hold that a
 
court in equity, in a partition action not involving ouster or
 agreement, has the discretionary authority to allow an
 
8
 Many courts use the terms "maintenance" and "improvement"
interchangeably or without any apparent regard to their difference, while
others use words such as "betterment" and "preservation." Some jurisdictions
permit offset against improvement expenses, but not maintenance expenses,
while other jurisdictions limit the improvement expenses against which an
offset may be made. Generally speaking, improvement/betterment involves the
material enhancement of the property, while maintenance/preservation involves
basic expenses, such as mortgage payments, insurance, real property taxes and
ordinary wear and tear. 
9
 Not all jurisdictions follow this exception. Some jurisdictions
allow no rental value offset under any circumstances. See Kline v. Kline, 581
 
A.2d 1300, 1310 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1990); Yakavonis v. Tilton, 968 P.2d 908
(Wash. Ct. App. 1998). Others allow offsets only against claims for
improvements. See Sack v. Tomlin, 871 P.2d 298 (Nev. 1994); Chance v. Kitchell
 
659 P.2d 895, 897 (N.M. 1983). 
14
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
apportioned defensive rental offset against maintenance-related
 
and improvement-related contributions, to the extent that the
 "reasonable rental value of the use of the property by the COTIP
 . . . has exceeded his or her proportionate share of ownership." 
Adkins, 595 So. 2d at 1035. "He who seeks equity must do
 equity." Adair v. Hustace, 64 Haw. 314, 321, n. 5, 640 P.2d 294,
 
300, n. 5 (1982) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
The apportioned rental offset exception is the 
counterpart of the equity that the court exercises in allowing the COTIP credit for unreimbursed maintenance and improvement expenditures, and is not inconsistent with prior Hawai
'i case 
law.10 The analysis focuses on whether one cotenant has a 
disproportionate share of the benefits or the burdens. An offset could be warranted because "if one cotenant enjoys a disproportionate share of the benefits, the other cotenants must be compensated[.]" Massey v. Hrostek, 980 A.2d 768, 775 (Vt. 
2009) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Parker v. Lambert, 206 S.W.3d 1, 5 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2006). The party seeking the rental offset has the burden of presenting evidence of the property's rental value. Esteves, 775 A.2d at 165. 
We do not decide here whether it was correct for the
 
circuit court to utilize the down payment amounts to determine
 the parties' equity percentages, and then also to include the
 same as contributions to be equalized, whether the circuit court
 was correct in assuming equal responsibility for each of the
 cotenants for the total expenses when the court also concluded
 
10
 In Nahaolelua, a partition action arising in the context of an
ouster, the Hawai' i Supreme Court commented that "compensation for use and
occupation should be allowed only for a period not exceeding . . . the period
for which rents and profits could be recovered at law[.]" 10 Haw. at 666.  In 
addition, the court held that a tenant in common who has made improvements ona good faith belief that he was the sole owner, is entitled to an allowance
for the value of the improvements upon partition. Id. at 662. 
We do not read the Nahaolelua comment concerning compensation for
use and occupation as extending to non-ouster cases. In an ouster case, the
COTOP is entitled to recover for use and occupation without regard to whether
the COTIP first seeks expense-related contribution. Yakanovis, 968 P.2d at
911. In the non-ouster situation, on the contrary, the COTOP is already
limited to an offset. Similarly, Nahaolelua's holding that a COTOP gets no
part of a COTIP's improvement is limited, we believe, to the case where
improvements have been made on the good faith belief that the COTIP was the
sole owner.
 
15

that the parties' equity percentages were unequal, or whether the
 
contributions recognized for improvement and expenses were
 appropriate. Nor do we consider whether the initial sale price
 of the K
Ilauea property was anything other than $171,000.11
 
Finally, we do not determine whether all of the contributions
 should be allocated on the same percentage basis, as the circuit
 court did here. 
We do not decide these issues because they have not 
been raised on appeal. Although Dorn filed a motion for new trial with the circuit court, neither he nor the Curtis raised these issues at the time, nor have they raised them on appeal; thus, they are not properly before this court. Kawamoto v. 
Yasutake, 49 Haw. 42, 45, 410 P.2d 976, 978 (1966); Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea Resort Co., Ltd., 100 Hawai
'i 97, 107, 58 P.3d 608, 618 (2002). 
Our holding is limited to adopting the principle that a 
defensive offset is available in a non-ouster partition case against maintenance-related and improvement-related contributions being required of the COTOP. Ultimately, as the Hawai
'i Supreme 
Court has said, "awards should be made according to the principles above stated only when no injustice would be done thereby." Nahaolelua, 10 Haw. at 667. It is the province of the 
circuit court to determine if such an offset is equitable under the circumstances of the case, and, if so, the reasonable rental value of the COTIP's use of the property, the extent to which that value has exceeded the COTIP's proportionate share of ownership, and any other equitable factors that apply in determining a fair allocation of the property's benefits and burdens. 
In sum, we conclude that the fact that a COTOP has not
 
been ousted from the property does not preclude the circuit court
 
11
 Amended FOF no. 3 states that the original purchase price of the
KIlauea property was $171,000, while at the beginning of trial, the parties
stipulated that the price was $171,500. The finding, however, has not been
challenged on appeal, and "unchallenged factual findings are deemed to be
binding on appeal . . . [and] an appellate court cannot . . . sua sponte revisit a finding of fact that neither party has challenged on appeal." Okada 
Trucking Co., Ltd. v. Bd. of Water Supply, 97 Hawai' i 450, 459, 40 P.3d 73, 82
(2002).

from awarding the COTOP a defensive rental offset under the
 
circumstances outlined above. Because the circuit court applied
 a different legal principle, we remand so that the principles set
 forth above may be utilized in the exercise of the circuit
 court's discretion.
 
As noted, the circuit court retains significant
 
discretion in determining whether and to what extent a rental
 offset shall be awarded within the legal framework we have
 announced. On remand, we direct the circuit court to adopt
 findings of fact and conclusions of law addressing whether Dorn
 is entitled to offset a share of the rental value during Curtis'
 occupancy of the K
Ilauea property against Curtis' claims for
 
contribution, and the basis for the amount of any offset awarded. 
B.	 The Circuit Court's Amended FOFs and COLs And The
 
Remaining Points Of Error On Appeal
 
Dorn challenges several of the circuit court's Amended
 
FOFs and COLs, along with two other undifferentiated points of
 
error. The bulk of these points are subsumed in and addressed in
 the discussion above, and the remainder are either unsupported or
 made moot by our decision here. As a result, they will not be
 addressed separately. 
V.	 CONCLUSION
 
For the reasons discussed herein, the November 8, 2006
 
Second Amended Judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to
 
the circuit court for further proceedings.
