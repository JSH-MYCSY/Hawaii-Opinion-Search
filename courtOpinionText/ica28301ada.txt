FIRST INSURANCE COMPANY OF HAWAII, LTD.,
Plaintiff-Appellant, v.

NO. 28301 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT

NAKAMURA, C.J., FUJISE AND REIFURTH, JJ.

 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY REIFURTH, J.
 
Plaintiff-Appellant First Insurance Co. of Hawaii, Ltd.
 
(First) appeals from the November 1, 2006 Final Judgment of the

 
Circuit Court of the Third Circuit (Circuit Court).1 Broadly
 
stated, the issues on appeal are whether Defendant-Appellee Angel
 
Dayoan, Sr. (Dayoan) remains entitled to wage loss benefits under
 a motor vehicle insurance policy issued by First, whether Dayoan
 was entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and costs, and, if
 so, whether the amount of attorneys' fees awarded was
 appropriate. 
As points of error, First contends that the Circuit 
Court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Dayoan, because the judgment (1) leads to an absurd and unjust result that is inconsistent with the purpose of Hawai
'i's no-fault law,

(2) fails to give effect to the Hawai 'i Legislature's 
(Legislature) intention concerning Hawai 'i's no-fault law as 
subsequently amended, (3) does not incorporate into Dayoan's 
personal auto policy the language of the no-fault law as subsequently amended, and (4) does not apply retroactively the language of the no-fault law as subsequently amended. In addition, First contends that the Circuit Court erred in awarding attorneys' fees to Dayoan, and awarding those fees at $250 per hour, despite (5) First's complaint being limited to declaratory relief, (6) First having paid monthly wage loss benefits to Dayoan throughout, and (7) the Hawai
'i Insurance Commissioner's 
(Commissioner) limitation of attorneys' fees to $125 per hour. 
We affirm.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 A. Factual Background
 On March 26, 1998, Dayoan was injured in a motor 
vehicle accident on Highway 19 on the Island of Hawai
'i 
(Accident). At the time of the Accident, Dayoan was sixty years old and was covered by a Personal Auto Policy issued in February 1998 by First to Magdalena S. Dayoan, Dayoan's wife (Policy). 
The Accident left Dayoan disabled and unable to engage 
in his usual occupation. At the time, Dayoan worked as a kitchen helper/dishwasher at Jimmy's Drive Inn in Hilo, Hawai
'i, and grew 
produce for additional income. The extent of Dayoan's disability and the reasonableness of the physician certification that he remains disabled are not issues on appeal.
2 
After the Accident, Dayoan applied for benefits as an
 
eligible injured person under the Policy. First extended
 coverage to Dayoan and, in a Disclosure of Benefits letter dated
 April 3, 1998, explained that the Policy included optional wage
 loss benefits that would terminate upon Dayoan's death. From

 First does not raise as a point of error the Circuit Court's
conclusion that First's obligation to Dayoan "shall terminate upon the death
of Plaintiff," except insofar as First contends that this illustrates the
"absurdity" of the aforementioned errors. "Points not presented in accordance
with this section will be disregarded[.]" Haw. R. App. P. 28(a)(4)(D) (2006).
"Points not argued may be deemed waived." Haw. R. App. P. 28(a)(7) (2006).

1998, Dayoan requested payment of wage loss benefits under the
 
Policy and First paid a monthly wage loss benefit of $1,500 to
 Dayoan pursuant to terms of the Policy. 
B.	 The Policy
 
Section II.A. of the Policy's Optional Benefits
 
Coverage Schedule provides coverage for wage loss of any
 "insured" under the Policy who, as a consequence of an "auto
 accident," suffers "bodily injury" which prevents the insured
 from engaging in the employment in which the insured was engaged
 immediately prior to the accident: 
INSURING AGREEMENT
 
For those coverages indicated as applicable in the Schedule
or in the Declarations, we will pay Optional Benefits to or
for an "insured" who sustains "bodily injury" resulting from
an "auto accident." Optional Benefits Coverage consists of
the coverages described below . . . .
 
1.	 Wage Loss. Monthly earnings loss, consisting of lost
net income after taxes, for injuries which prevent an
"insured" from engaging in the employment in which the
"insured" was engaged in immediately prior to the
"auto accident." 
a. Wage loss shall be paid: 
(1)	 For up to two years following the date of the
accident as long as the treating health care
provider determines the "insured's" injuries
prevent the "insured" from engaging in the
employment he or she was engaged in immediately
prior to the accident. 
(2)	 After two years following the date of the
accident only if the treating health care
provider determines the "insured" is disabled
from employment to which the "insured" is suited
by education, training and experience.
 
. . . .
 
b.	 Wage loss, including loss of expected income,
shall terminate upon the death of the "insured."
 
C.	 Hawai'i Insurance Code 
Hawai'i's insurance laws are set out in chapter 431, 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) (2005 and Supp. 2009) (Insurance
 
Code). "The statutory law in force and effect at the time of the
 issuance of a policy becomes a part of the contract as though
 expressly written therein and a policy must be considered to
 contain those requirements." Bowers v. Alamo Rent-A-Car, Inc.,

88 Hawai 'i 274, 281, 965 P.2d 1274, 1281 (1998) (quoting Eric 
Mills Holmes, Holmes's Appleman on Insurance § 9.1, at 477 (2d 
ed. 1996)). 
HRS § 431:10C-302 (Supp. 1997) (Section 302) addresses
 
an insurer's obligation to make available various optional
 insurance coverages. Coverages are optional because insureds may
 choose to pay for and receive them, or not. Mandatory coverages,
 on the other hand, are provided for in HRS § 431:10C-301 (Supp.
 1997) (Section 301). Coverages are mandatory in that they are
 required by law to be a part of the no-fault base benefits
 package, and are received and paid for whether the policyholder
 wants them or not. 
The Hawai
'i motor vehicle insurance law was 
substantially modified in the 1997 legislative session in Act 251, with amendments made effective January 1, 1998 (Act 251).
3 
The purpose of Act 251 was "to provide much demanded and much needed amendments to the motor vehicle insurance law to reduce motor vehicle insurance premiums and to preserve adequate protection of the rights of drivers." 1997 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 251, § 1 at 514. 
One of the legislative sponsors explained how the
 
proposal would produce savings by allowing consumers to select or
 opt out from expensive optional coverages:
 
We've made many of the costly mandatory coverages required
 
under our current law optional. This is pro consumer and it
produces savings. It now puts the consumer in the driver's
seat to select the kind of automobile coverage the consumer
needs. It's not mandated by the state that we carry all of
these coverages if in fact we do not need them. Wage loss,
 
death benefits, alternative care providers are examples of
 
coverage that is now optional.
 
1997 Haw. Senate Journal, at 798 (comments of Senator Baker)

 Senator Baker referred to the fact that "our actuary, Mr. Simons,
has given us his stamp of approval on the bill . . . and he is confident [this
bill] will, in fact, produce savings of between 20 and 35 percent." 1997 Haw.
 Senate Journal, at 797 (comments of Senator Baker). Senator Baker then
 introduced Mr. Simons's May 1, 1997 memorandum to Insurance Commissioner Rey

optional coverages might end up paying more.5

Graulty into the Senate Journal. Mr. Simons explained that insureds who did
not wish or need to purchase wage loss coverage would benefit from making the
coverage optional:
 (4) Under the current system, insurance purchasers are
required to purchase coverage for wage losses regardless of
whether they are wage earners or not and regardless of
whether they have wage loss coverage elsewhere or not. This
 includes retired people as well as those with wage loss
coverage through a program provided by their employer.
HB100 CD1 provides the opportunity for people to save money
by not having to purchase coverage for funds they will never
collect or for losses that are covered elsewhere. These are
 real savings provided for automobile insurance policyholders
whether they purchase minimum limits or higher limits of
coverage.
 
1997 Haw. Senate Journal, at 812 (Attachment "II").
 
Others emphasized that there was risk involved in making optional
the former mandatory coverages. In the House of Representatives, for
instance, Representative Colleen Meyer expressed concerns:
 The savings this bill provides are due to a reduction in
the mandated minimum coverage. As my colleague from Puna
stated earlier, anyone would expect to pay less for half as
much of a product that they are purchasing.
 I am concerned about the wage loss coverage not being
included. There are many people that have been paying for
insurance for twenty years was included [sic] and there is
truly a potential that they will not ask for that optional
coverage, not realizing that it's not included and could
find themselves in a very bad bind if they are involved in a
serious accident.
 
1997 Haw. House Journal, at 1003 (comments of Representative Meyer).
 
5 During the floor vote (final reading) on the conference draft of
the bill, Senator Randy Iwase spoke against the bill, by quoting from a letter
from an insurance company that was addressed to the senate, then noting that
if an insured already purchased and wanted to continue the newly optional
coverages, his or her premium would likely increase:
 
"[A]lthough there are some cost-saving features in
this bill, most of the savings are due to a reduction

. . . in mandated minimum coverage. This means
 individuals who carry higher limits and desire the
same amount of coverage as they have today will see
little savings . . . under the new system. In fact,
some could even see price increases."
 . . . .
 . . . [I]f you are among the vast middle class . . . struggling
to make ends meet, this bill will not help you. You will not see
 
a 20 percent reduction -- let's be honest about that! You may
even see an increase -- let's be honest about that! . . . You need
 wage loss coverage. This bill will not bring a reduction in
premium. It may even bring a premium increase if you purchase

In sum, the 1997 Legislature addressed motor vehicle 
insurance system costs by: "(1) reducing the tort threshold; (2) 
converting costly mandatory coverages for wage loss, death benefits, and alternative care benefits to optional coverages; and (3) reducing recoveries for bodily injury damages by a covered loss deductible." State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. 
Gepaya, 103 Hawai
'i 142, 148, 80 P.3d 321, 327 (2003).6 
The following year, the 1998 Legislature made further
 
amendments to Section 302 as part of Act 275 (Act 275).7 The
 
purpose of Act 275 was explained as follows:
 
SECTION 1. The purpose of this Act is to continue to
effectuate motor vehicle insurance reform initiated by the
passage of Act 251, Session Laws of Hawaii 1997. This Act:
 
(1)	 Assists Hawaii drivers and insurers during the
transitional phase of the implementation of new
laws;
 
(2)	 Streamlines the motor vehicle insurance
 administration process; and
 
(3)	 Makes numerous technical, nonsubstantive changes
for purposes of clarity and style.

The 1998 Amendments relating to the wage loss benefit

limits, but removed the treating physician certification of
 
eligibility from the process. Id.
 
D. Proceedings
 On April 21, 2005, after paying wage loss benefits to
 
Dayoan for almost seven years, First filed a Complaint For
 Declaratory Judgment requesting that the Circuit Court declare
 that First was no longer obligated to extend wage loss benefits
 to Dayoan. 
First argued that it was entitled to summary judgment
 
because the 1998 Legislature capped the amount of wage loss
 benefits to which policyholders were entitled. First argued that
 this amendment, although enacted subsequent to the Accident,
 should be read to (i) clarify the Legislature's intent in
 adopting the 1997 Amendments to Section 302, (ii) clarify the
 terms of Dayoan's Policy, and (iii) thereby limit the insurer's
 wage loss liability to $9,000 per accident. According to First,
 Dayoan, at 68 years of age, was "no longer suited for
 employment." Consequently, First argued, Dayoan's reading of the
 Policy "would lead to the illogical and inconceivable result of
 forcing an insurer to continue to pay wage loss benefits to an
 insured who is no longer suited for employment and would not
 have, in reality, incurred any loss of wages." 
Dayoan countered that he was entitled to summary
 
judgment because he was entitled to receive wage loss benefits
 under the terms of the Policy.
 
The Circuit Court denied First's and granted Dayoan's
 
motion for summary judgment, concluding that the Policy and the
 1997 Amendments on which it was based were clear:
 
It appears to the court that, as I indicated, the language
in the policy is clear, especially when you look at
subsequent attempts at limiting that liability. Now, I
don't think that interpreting the policy and, generally, the
statute in the same way, because of the clear statutory
language, results in any absurdity. And the reason I say
that is because there are ample examples where the actuarial
risks undertaken by the insurer includes . . . measuring
exposure by a -- a person's life –- life insurance annuities
and so forth. And to the court . . . the risk inherent in
 terms of what was in the policy is apparent.
 
If the insurance company is now saying, well, we
didn't take it into account, and I think that's their
problem, it's not an interpretation of, you know, it's not a
 
7
   
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
probable interpretation what they provided in the policy or
what was clear in the statute. And although I'm not resting
my ruling entirely on it, it looks like the subsequent
statutory change, to include the twelve thousand dollar
limit, would seem to indicate to me that was, at least, some
indication that something –- that there was . . . a desire
to change what was . . . a cap . . . of the benefit at the
end of a person's lifetime to a dollar amount.
 
E. Attorneys' fees and costs
 
Following the Circuit Court's award of summary
 
judgment, Dayoan filed a motion under HRS § 431:10-242 (2005)
 
8
(Section 242)  seeking $10,885.35 in attorneys' fees and excise
tax and $695.99 for costs. First countered that fees and costs
 were not available under the Insurance Code and, if they were,
 the fees were excessive at an hourly rate of $250.
 
The Circuit Court awarded Dayoan attorneys' fees in the

 
amount of $10,450.00, at a rate of $250 per hour, and costs in
 the amount of $695.00, ruling that the time spent and hourly rate
 of counsel was reasonable. Dayoan's request for $435.35 in
 general excise tax costs was denied.

Statutory Interpretation

 
We review the circuit court's interpretation of a
statute de novo. Our statutory construction is guided by
established rules:
 
When construing a statute, our foremost

obligation is to ascertain and give effect to the
intention of the legislature, which is to be obtained
primarily from the language contained in the statute
itself. And we must read statutory language in the
context of the entire statute and construe it in a
 manner consistent with its purpose.

[The appellate] court reviews the denial and granting
of attorney's fees under the abuse of discretion standard.
The same standard applies to [the appellate] court's review

An abuse of discretion occurs if the trial court has clearly
exceeded the bounds of reason or has disregarded rules or
principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment
of a party litigant.

the State of Hawai 'i, 92 Hawai 'i 432, 439, 992 P.2d 127, 134 
(2000)). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
A. 	The Circuit Court Properly Granted Dayoan's Motion For
Summary Judgment 
Dayoan is an "insured" under the Policy, who, as a
 
consequence of the Accident suffered "bodily injury" which
 
prevented him from engaging in the employment in which he was
 engaged immediately prior to the Accident. Dayoan's Policy
 included optional wage loss coverage, and, under this provision,
 Dayoan is entitled to $1,500 per month for as long as his
 treating health care provider determines that he is disabled from
 the employment to which he is suited by education, training, and
 experience. First does not contest Dayoan's entitlement to wage
 loss benefits under the Policy. In fact, First explicitly
 informed Dayoan that "wage loss shall terminate upon [his]
 death."
 
Absent an exception of the sort urged by First below, 
the Policy is governed by the law in effect at the time of its issuance. As to wage loss benefits under the Policy, we would therefore be required to apply the 1997 Amendments "as though expressly written therein." Bowers, 88 Hawai
'i at 281, 965 P.2d 
at 1281. Under the plain language of the 1997 Amendments and the Policy, the terms of which are consistent with the amendments, Dayoan is entitled to wage loss benefits of $1,500 per month. According to the unchallenged conclusion of the Circuit Court, that benefit "shall terminate upon [Dayoan's] death." See, supra 
at 2, n.2. 
First takes no issue with the Circuit Court's
 
conclusion that the plain language of the Policy and the 1997
 Amendments incorporate no per accident cap on wage loss benefits. 
Rather, First urges a limitation on Dayoan's entitlement founded
 instead upon its contention that an uncapped wage loss benefit is
 illogical, inconceivable, absurd or unjust, and that the
 Legislature's adoption of the 1998 Amendments discloses a
 
10
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
legislative intent to have adopted, in 1997, a cap on overall
 
wage loss benefits. For the reasons discussed below, we conclude
 to the contrary.
 
1.	 The Circuit Court's order granting Dayoan's motion
for summary judgment did not lead to an absurd orunjust result and was not inconsistent with thepurpose of the Hawai
'i no-fault law. 
First asserts that the Circuit Court erred in granting 
Dayoan's motion for summary judgment because it "leads to an 
absurd and unjust result that is inconsistent with the purpose of the Hawai
'i no-fault law, which is to reduce and stabilize the 
cost of vehicle insurance." Specifically, First argues that the Circuit Court's interpretation of Section 302 leads "to an illogical and absurd result by compelling the motor vehicle insurance carrier to pay wage loss benefits for years, perhaps decades, following a single motor vehicle accident." First contends that Dayoan is no longer suited for employment because of his age and that, except for the Accident, he would likely not be working any longer. As a result, First claims that the Circuit Court's application of the 1997 Amendments leads to the "illogical and inconceivable" result of forcing an insurer to pay wage loss benefits to an insured who is no longer suited for employment. 
When the law is unambiguous, "our sole duty is to give 
effect to its plain and obvious meaning." State v. Kalama, 94 
Hawai
'i 60, 64, 8 P.3d 1224, 1228 (2000) (internal quotation 
marks omitted) (quoting Citizens for Protection of North Kohala Coastline v. County of Hawaii, 91 Hawai
'i 94, 107, 979 P.2d 1120, 
1133 (1999)). "Departure from the literal construction of a statute is justified only if such a construction yields an absurd and unjust result obviously inconsistent with the purposes and policies of the statute." Leslie v. Bd. of Appeals, 109 Hawai
'i 
384, 393, 126 P.3d 1071, 1080 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Shin v. McLaughlin, 89 Hawai
'i 1, 4, 967 P.2d 
1059, 1062 (1998)). 
In addition, the Circuit Court's interpretation of
 
Section 302 is not inconsistent with the Legislature's goal of
 
11
   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
reducing and stabilizing the cost of vehicle insurance. The 1997
 
Amendments to Section 302 were part of a "full scale change[] to
 fix the [motor vehicle insurance] system" designed to "yield a
 significant reduction in premiums, control litigation, and
 provide adequate medical coverage without a cost shift to
 businesses and employees." Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 932, in 1997
 Haw. Senate Journal, at 1255.
 
There were multiple amendments in 1997 to the wage loss
 
benefit provisions, and wage loss benefit amendments were only a
 small fraction of the total no-fault amendments included as part
 of Act 251.
9 Nothing requires that each of the Act 251
 
components achieve cost reductions for all insureds in all
 circumstances in order to meet the law's objectives. 
A significant feature of the 1997 Amendments was that
 
savings would be achieved by making wage loss an optional
 coverage that insureds were no longer required to purchase.
10 
 
Others noted that premiums might increase for those who purchased
 optional coverages.
11 Therefore, an increase in premiums for
 
those who purchased the wage loss benefit was neither unforseen
 nor inconsistent with the Legislature's stated intent in adopting
 Act 251.
12
 
2.	 The Circuit Court did not err by failing to give
effect to the Legislature's intention as reflected
in the 1998 Amendments to Section 302 in granting
Dayoan's motion for summary judgment.
 
The chronology of events is important in evaluating the
 
9 Act 251 consisted of seventy sections, fifty-nine of which amended
different sections of the Insurance Code. Of those, only three sections
(sections 13, 38 and 41) address the wage loss (or monthly earnings loss)
benefit. 1997 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 251, passim. 
without deciding, that nothing in the 1997 Amendments appears to prohibit a

10 Supra at 4-5, n.4. 
11 Supra at 5-6, n.5. 
12 As to the issue of Dayoan's age-related employability, we note, 
certifying physician from considering whether the presenting patient is
otherwise unemployable irrespective of accident-related injuries.
Furthermore, First provides no evidence that it would have refused premiums
from any insured who was past the "retirement age" of 65. In sum, the result
here is not illogical, inconceivable, absurd or unjust.
 
12
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Legislature's intent. Act 251 and, in particular, the 1997
 
Amendments had an effective date of January 1, 1998. Dayoan's
 Policy was issued in February 1998, the Accident occurred on
 March 26, 1998, and his notice of claim was filed with First on
 or before April 3, 1998. The 1998 Amendments became effective on
 July 20, 1998. 
First contends that the Policy should be interpreted 
consistently with the 1998 Amendments because those amendments "clarify the intent of Act 251." (quoting Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 117, in 1998 Haw. House Journal, at 1000). Although we look to subsequent legislative history to confirm our interpretation of earlier statutory provisions, Macabio v. TIG Ins. Co., 87 Hawai
'i 
307, 317, 955 P.2d 100, 110 (1998), we weigh such arguments with "extreme care." Hawaii Providers Network, Inc. v. AIG Hawaii 
Ins. Co. , 105 Hawai
'i 362, 370 n.19, 98 P.3d 233, 241 n.19 
(2004) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Andrus v. Shell Oil Co., 446 U.S. 657, 666 n.8 (1980)). 
While we do not reject out of hand subsequent
 
legislative action as a basis for interpreting a previously
 adopted statute, a 1998 Conference Committee Report is a slender
 reed upon which to determine the 1997 Legislature's intent. What
 is evident is that there were multiple purposes behind the
 multiple amendments that were, collectively, Act 251.
 
One of the fundamental rules for interpreting an 
insurance policy is that "the statute in effect as of the policy's effective date, governs the policy at issue and is part of the contract with full binding effect upon each party." Allstate Ins. Co. v. Kaneshiro, 93 Hawai
'i 210, 214, 998 P.2d 
490, 494 (2000). The Circuit Court's reading of Section 302 is not inconsistent with the Legislature's intent in adopting Act 251. Consequently, we reject First's invitation to depart from
 
the law in effect at the time of the Policy's effective date.
 
The fact that the 1997 Amendments did not include an
 
upper limit to wage loss benefits does not establish First's
 claim that there was a "defect" or an "oversight" in the law,
 since the 1998 Amendments did not mandate an upper limit
 
13
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
either.13 The 1998 Amendments stated a nominal per accident
 
benefits cap, but explicitly retained the ability for insurers to
 
"mak[e] available higher limits of coverage." As a result, there
 is nothing upon which we can conclude that First would have
 capped wage loss benefits in February 1998 (when Dayoan's Policy
 was issued) even if the 1998 Amendments were interpreted as being
 applicable to the Policy.
14
 
In sum, reducing the benefits that insureds were
 
required to purchase was expected to result in a less expensive
 base vehicle insurance policy. Focusing on a single optional
 benefit as applied to a single covered insured cannot establish
 that the 1998 Amendments to Section 302 better reflected the 1997
 Legislature's intent in adopting Act 251. The Policy provided
 that wage loss benefits "shall terminate upon the death of the
 'insured'," and that provision was not inconsistent with or
 barred by the 1997 Amendments. The failure of the 1997
 Amendments to preclude an uncapped wage loss benefit is not
 absurd and we cannot rewrite the statute under the guise of
 clarification. The fact that the Legislature amended the statute
 in 1998 to permit wage loss benefit caps is not sufficient to
 establish that it meant to require them in 1997. Absent a more
 definite statement by the Legislature, we cannot allow a
 subsequent amendment to govern interpretation of a prior statute.
 
3.	 The Circuit Court did not err by not incorporating
into Dayoan's Policy, or retroactively applying,
the 1998 Amendments to Section 302.
 
Finally, First raises two related arguments, contending
 
13 First's contention that the 1998 Amendments established a wage
loss benefits cap is inconsistent with our previous observation that the 1998
Amendments "establish[ed] an effective minimum amount of coverage[.]" Dai-
Tokyo Royal State Ins. Co. v. Yokote, 103 Hawai' i 181, 188, 80 P.3d 1002, 1009
(App. 2003) (emphasis added). See also Mizoguchi v. State Farm Mut. Auto. 
Ins. Co., 66 Haw. 373, 377-378, 663 P.2d 1071, 1074 (1983) ("It is apparent
therefore that the statutory provisions regarding basic no-fault benefits setminimum limits, which the parties are allowed to exceed."). 
14
 It does further damage to First's argument that, despite the
Legislature's adoption of the 1998 Amendments to Section 302, First
subsequently offered uncapped wage loss coverage to Dayoan for the period
August 4, 1998 - February 4, 1999 at the same price that it was offered in the
prior period. 
14
   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that the Circuit Court erred by not retroactively incorporating
 
into the Policy, or retroactively applying, the 1998 Amendments
 to Section 302. 
As noted above, "[t]he statutory law in force and 
effect at the time of the issuance of a policy becomes a part of the contract as though expressly written therein and a policy must be considered to contain those requirements." Bowers, 88 
Hawai
'i at 281, 965 P.2d at 1281 (quoting Holmes's Appleman on 
Insurance § 9.1, at 477). First argues, however, that the 1998 Amendments, and not the 1997 Amendments, should be incorporated into or used to interpret the Policy. 
First makes two arguments in support: (1) when an 
insurance policy is in conflict with applicable law, the law must take precedence, citing Sol v. AIG Hawai
'i Ins. Co., 76 Hawai 'i 
304, 307, 875 P.2d 921, 924 (1994); and (2) laws that are subsequently amended for remedial or clarification reasons are applied retroactively, citing Tam v. Kaiser Permanente, 94 Hawai
'i 487, 495-96, 17 P.3d 219, 227-28 (2001). 
Neither case, however, supports First's argument. Sol 
involved a contractual provision that was prohibited by existing law. Finding that "[t]he terms of the contract contravene the statutory language intended to prevent off-sets of no-fault benefits from uninsured motorist benefits[,]" the court held that the law prevailed. Sol, 76 Hawai
'i at 307, 875 P.2d at 924. 
In the instant case, the terms of the Policy
 
incorporated the 1997 Amendments and, even after Act 275 was
 adopted, were not prohibited by the 1998 Amendments. The
 Policy's wage loss benefit levels, for instance, were not
 prohibited by Act 275, which explicitly continued to provide that
 "nothing shall prevent an insurer from making available higher
 limits of coverage." H
AW. REV. STAT. § 431:10C-302(a)(4) (2005);
 
1998 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 275, § 18 at 930. 
First contends that Tam closes the logical loop and
 
requires that the 1998 Amendments apply retroactively. Tam,
 
however, holds that under "established rule[s] of construction, a
 statute providing remedies or procedures that do not affect
 existing rights, but merely alter the means of enforcing or
 
15
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
giving effect to such rights, may apply to pending claims-even 
those arising before the effective date of the statute."  Tam, 94 
Hawai'i at 495, 17 P.3d at 227 (emphasis added). Since Dayoan 
had an "existing right" to wage loss benefits as of the Accident, the 1998 Amendments would not relate back under Tam. 
The 1997 Amendments required, and the 1998 Amendments
 
carried forward the requirement, that "[a]ny change in the wage
 loss benefits coverage selected by an insured shall apply only to
 benefits arising out of motor vehicle accidents occurring after
 the date the change becomes effective." Compare 1997 Haw. Sess.
 
Laws Act 251, § 39 at 536 with 1998 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 275, § 18
 at 930. Although applying to choices made by the insured, this
 provision suggests that the Legislature wanted the wage loss
 benefit coverage in effect when an accident occurred to apply.
 
In Hawai
'i, "[n]o law has any retrospective operation, 
unless otherwise expressed or obviously intended." H AW. REV. 
STAT. § 1-3 (2009). The provision "is only a rule of statutory 
construction and where the legislative intent may be ascertained, it is no longer determinative." State v. Nguyen, 81 Hawai
'i 279, 
290, 916 P.2d 689, 700 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting State v. VonGeldern, 64 Haw. 210, 213, 638 P.2d 319, 322 (1981)). We find no contrary legislative intent in the instant case, and find no error in the Circuit Court's failure to incorporate into Dayoan's Policy, or to retroactively apply, the 1998 Amendments to Section 302. 
B.	 The Circuit Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion In
 
Awarding Dayoan Attorneys' Fees and Costs
 
First raises three points of error with regard to the
 
Circuit Court's award of attorneys' fees and costs: (1) that fees
 
and costs were not warranted because First sought declaratory
 relief; (2) that fees and costs were not warranted because First
 continued to pay wage loss benefits to Dayoan; and (3) that the
 amount of the fees awarded was excessive because the Commissioner
 had previously determined that $125 was a reasonable hourly rate
 for purposes of attorneys' fees recovery. 
16
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The fact that First sought declaratory relief from the
 
Circuit Court and continued to pay wage loss benefits to Dayoan
 
throughout the period of the challenge has no bearing on Dayoan's
 entitlement to attorneys' fees and costs under Section 242, which
 provides that:
 
Where an insurer has contested its liability under a
policy and is ordered by the courts to pay benefits under
the policy, the policyholder, the beneficiary under a
policy, or the person who has acquired the rights of the
policyholder or beneficiary under the policy shall be
awarded reasonable attorney's fees and the costs of suit, in
addition to the benefits under the policy.
 
HAW.  REV.  STAT. § 431:10-242.
 
By requesting that the Circuit Court declare that it
 
was no longer responsible for paying Dayoan's wage loss benefits,
 
First disputed its liability under the Policy. When the Circuit
 Court declared that First "has an obligation to pay wage loss
 benefits to [Dayoan] . . . in the amount of $1,500 per month[,]"
 Dayoan's rights under Section 242 were implicated.
 
First cites to Mikelson v. United Serv. Auto. Ass'n, 
108 Hawai
'i 358, 120 P.3d 257 (2005), in support of its 
contention that Section 242 is inapplicable in the circumstances of this case. To the contrary, however, Mikelson demonstrates why attorneys' fees and costs are properly awarded here. In denying the plaintiff's request for attorneys' fees, the Hawai
'i 
Supreme Court focused on the fact that the trial court's order declared that the insured was entitled to "coverage," and made no mention of the payment of "benefits": 
The fact that the court and the participants in this case
appear to have given due consideration to the language in
the order that entitles Mikelson to coverage rather than
benefits, suggests an intent by the court to refrain from
ordering that benefits be paid to Mikelson, as such payment
issue will be decided via arbitration. Under the
 circumstances, Mikelson's request for attorney's fees is
denied.
 
Id. at 361, 120 P.3d at 260. 
Here, to the contrary, the Final Judgment specifically
 
provides that "Plaintiff FIRST INSURANCE COMPANY OF HAWAII, LTD.
 
has an obligation to pay wage loss benefits to Defendant ANGEL
 DAYOAN, SR. under the terms of the applicable Personal Auto
 Policy in the amount of $1500 per month which shall terminate
 
17
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
upon the death of Plaintiff ANGEL DAYOAN, SR.[.]" Accordingly, 
Section 242 is applicable, and Dayoan is entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.  See Commerce & Indus. Ins. Co. v. 
Bank of Hawaii, 73 Haw. 322, 329, 832 P.2d 733, 737 (1992) (insurer properly ordered to pay attorneys' fees and costs under Section 242 after contesting liability via declaratory relief action and being ordered to continue paying defense costs); cf. Ranger Ins. Co. v. Hinshaw, 103 Hawai
'i 26, 34, 79 P.3d 119, 127 
(2003) (insurer's declaratory relief action amounted to contesting liability under the policy; because case was voluntarily dismissed, however, insurer was not ordered to pay benefits thereunder, and therefore was not responsible for attorneys' fees under Section 242). 
First further contends that reasonable fees, under the
 
circumstances, should not be calculated at $250 per hour, but at
 $125 per hour, as the administrative hearings officer concluded,
 and the Commissioner confirmed in his July 11, 2005 final order
 in Ruhland v. AIG Hawaii Inc. Co., Case Nos. ATX-2005-40-P, ATX­2005-41-P, and ATX-2005-59-P. The Commissioner's decision does
 not preclude the Circuit Court from determining that $250 per
 hour is a more appropriate rate under different circumstances. 
Indeed, the administrative hearings officer concluded that the
 claimant in that case presented no evidence to establish that the
 hourly rate charged by the claimant's counsel was in line with
 the prevailing hourly rate charged by other practitioners in this
 area of the law. 
Section 242 specifically states that the court "shall"
 
award "reasonable attorney's fees and costs." To determine the
 reasonableness of attorneys' fees, we examine a variety of
 factors:
 
(1) the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty
of the questions involved and the skill requisite properly
to conduct the cause; (2) whether the acceptance of
employment in the particular case will preclude the lawyer's
appearance for others in cases likely to arise out of the
transaction, and in which there is a reasonable expectation
that otherwise he would be employed, or will involve the
loss of other employment while employed in the particular
case or antagonisms with other clients; (3) the customary
charges of the Bar for similar services; (4) the amount
involved in the controversy and the benefits resulting to
the client from the services; (5) the contingency or the
 
18
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
certainty of the compensation; and (6) the character of the
employment, whether casual or for an established and
constant client. No one of these considerations in itself is
 controlling. They are mere guides in ascertaining the real
value of the service.
 
Sharp v. Hui Wahine, Inc., 49 Haw. 241, 244-45, 413 P.2d 242, 245
 
-46 (1966) (quotation marks and citation omitted). These
 factors, however, are "mere guides in ascertaining the real value
 of the service," and the court is not required to consider each
 of them in every case. Booker v. Midpac Lumber Co., 65 Haw. 166,
 
173, 649 P.2d 376, 381 (1982) (internal quotation marks and
 citation omitted).
 
The record shows that Dayoan's attorneys had each 
practiced law in Hawai
'i for almost twenty years. In addition, 
Section 302 had only recently been amended, and there were no published cases to serve as precedent. Moreover, Dayoan's attorneys submitted a list of Hawai
'i law firms and their hourly 
charges for partners showing that partners in Hawai 'i law firms 
charged between $150 and $230 on the low end, and between $250­$475 on the high end. 
Finally, although the amount in controversy cannot be
 
determined with certainty, and although First does not contend
 that the amount of the awarded fees is unreasonable except to the
 extent that the total amount is calculated based on an attorneys'
 hourly rate of $250, First has been paying Dayoan $18,000 per
 year, or $162,000 over nine years. Attorneys' fees of $10,450 is
 not unreasonable in light of the amount in controversy or the
 benefits of the services provided.
 
The award and amount of attorneys' fees rests within 
the sound discretion of the Circuit Court. Nothing in the record establishes that the court has "clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or has disregarded rules or principles of law or practice." Chun, 106 Hawai
'i at 431, 106 P.3d at 354. Thus, we 
conclude that the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorneys' fees of $10,450 that incorporate a rate of $250 per hour to Dayoan's attorneys. 
19
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
Ultimately, First is obliged to provide the contracted-
for benefit because it offered the coverage, established the
 
price at which it was offered, accepted Dayoan's premiums
 associated with the coverage, and assured him that he would
 receive the benefit until he died. 
The Circuit Court did not err in granting summary
 
judgment or in awarding attorneys' fees and costs to Dayoan. 
Accordingly, we affirm the November 1, 2006 Final Judgment that
 was entered in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit.
