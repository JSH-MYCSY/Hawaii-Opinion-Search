SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER

 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley, Fujise, JJ.)
 
Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Company (Liberty Mutual)
 
appeals and the Insurance Commissioner, Department of Commerce
 
and Consumer Affairs, cross-appeals from the Judgment filed by
 the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court)

of Chung Mi Ahn (Ahn). On appeal, Liberty Mutual and the
 Insurance Commissioner argue that the circuit court erred in
 ruling that Ahn is a real party in interest to pursue a claim for
 an unpaid medical bill against Liberty Mutual. For the reasons
 set forth in this court's recent decision in Kim v. Liberty Mut.
 
1 The Honorable Eden Elizabeth Hifo presided.
