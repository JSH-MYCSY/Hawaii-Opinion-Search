(Young) (collectively, Property Managers); and Mark Donnelly
 
(Donnelly), a prospective home buyer (collectively, Defendants). 
Fyffe also challenges the award of attorneys fees and costs in
 
Defendants' favor.
 
Fyffe alleged in his complaint that Hue breached a
 
contract to sell him certain real estate located along Matsonia
 
Drive in Honolulu (the Property) where he had lived for several
 
decades; that Hue, Ito, and Davis made material
 
misrepresentations to Fyffe; and that Davis and Property Managers
 
tortiously interfered with the contract between Hue and Fyffe. 
Fyffe demanded specific performance or damages for the breach
 
from Hue and damages for the torts from the remaining Defendants.
 
Upon careful review of the record and having given due
 
consideration to the arguments advanced by the parties, as well
 
as the relevant law, we resolve Fyffe's points of error as
 
follows:
 
(1) The circuit court properly treated Defendants' 
motions to dismiss as motions for summary judgment. Where 
"matters outside the pleadings [were] presented to and not 
excluded by the court[,]" a motion to dismiss under Hawai ri Rules 
of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 12(b) is converted into a motion for summary judgment and treated accordingly under HRCP Rule 56. 
Richards v. Midkiff, 48 Haw. 32, 38, 396 P.2d 49, 54 (1964) 
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Given that the 
circuit court reviewed the court records, files, and arguments of 
counsel, it considered matters beyond the pleadings and 
appropriately treated the Defendants' motions for dismissal as 
motions for summary judgment. 
(2) The circuit court did not err in granting summary
 
judgment in favor of Hue on Fyffe's specific performance and
 
breach of contract claims because there was no enforceable
 
contract.
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI rI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Fyffe takes alternative positions regarding how he and
 
Hue finalized an agreement to buy and sell the property. In his
 
opening brief, Fyffe argues that the terms of the agreement are
 
memorialized in a document dated March 8, 2003, but in his reply
 
brief Fyffe claimed that he and Hue had struck an oral agreement
 
"long before," perhaps in the late 1990s.
 
The "agreement" made in the 1990s that Fyffe would buy
 
the property "subject to financing" cannot be legally enforced
 
because it is imprecise when stating the time and manner of
 
payment, essential terms of a contract for the sale of land. In
 
re Sing Chong Co., Ltd., 1 Haw. App. 236, 239, 617 P.2d 578, 581
 (1980). Because the agreement was that the sale would be made
 
"subject to financing" but "the financing clause lack[ed]
 
sufficient definiteness for a court to determine the terms of
 
financing, the entire agreement is unenforceable." Nodolf v.
 
Nelson, 309 N.W.2d 397, 398-99 (Wis. Ct. App. 1981) (citations
 omitted). As such, the statements Hue allegedly made in the
 
1990s were "[m]ere expressions of an intention to convey land at
 
a future time." Molokai Ranch, Ltd. v. Morris, 36 Haw. 219, 227
 
(Haw. Terr. 1942).
 
The March 8, 2003 document relied upon by Fyffe does
 
not comply with the Statute of Frauds because Hue had not signed
 it. Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 656-1 (1993). Nevertheless,
 
Fyffe urges that the terms of the document be enforced as an oral
 
contract, regardless of the fact that the document states that
 
Hue's written acceptance was a condition precedent to enforcement
 
of the contract. Although parties who have expressly agreed that
 
they shall not be bound until a written document has been signed
 
and delivered may bind themselves by a subsequent oral contract,
 
1 Joseph M. Perillo, Corbin on Contracts § 2.10 (Rev. ed. 1993),
 
Fyffe offered no proof, compliant with HRCP Rule 56(e), of Hue's
 
intent to be bound without her signature. Therefore, Fyffe
 
failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to the
 
existence of an oral agreement, making summary judgment against
 
3
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI rI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Fyffe appropriate. See Island Holidays, Inc. v. Fitzgerald, 58
 
Haw. 552, 563, 574 P.2d 884, 891 (1978).
 
Because Fyffe failed to show there was an enforceable
 
contract, we need not consider whether the actions he cites as
 
part performance were sufficient to remove the bar of the Statute
 
of Frauds.
 
(3) The circuit court did not err in granting summary 
judgment to Davis on the misrepresentation claims. We agree with 
Davis that there is no admissible evidence of the alleged 
misrepresentation. Fyffe's declaration stating that Davis 
"blithely announced to both [Fyffe] and [Fyffe]'s mortgage broker 
that [Fyffe] 'is not able to do the loan'" does not appear to be 
"made on personal knowledge" nor does it "show affirmatively that 
[Fyffe] is competent to testify to the matters stated therein," 
as required by HRCP Rule 56(e). Although Fyffe could attest to 
what Davis allegedly said to him, Fyffe has not shown how he as 
the recipient relied upon the misrepresentation. See Blair v. 
Ing, 95 Hawai ri 247, 269, 21 P.3d 452, 474 (2001). Fyffe does 
not aver that he was present when Davis allegedly made the 
comment to Fyffe's mortgage broker. As such, Fyffe's 
declarations provide no basis to deny summary judgment to Davis 
on the misrepresentation claim. 
(4) Summary judgment in favor of Davis, Ito, the 
Property Managers, and Donnelly was not erroneous where Fyffe 
alleged tortious interference with contractual relations but 
failed to show there was an oral or written contract, an 
essential element of the tort. Lee v. Aiu, 85 Hawai ri 19, 32, 
936 P.2d 655, 668 (1997). Fyffe's alternative suggestion that they had tortiously interfered with prospective contractual 
relations was not timely pleaded. See HRCP Rule 15(a). 
(5) Fyffe failed to cite any law supporting his claim
 
that he was denied equal protection as one of a class of "lawyers
 
of some age and inexperience." A wealth of case law, however,
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI rI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
denies suspect class status to lawyers in general and lawyers
 
with certain expertise in particular. See, e.g., Onyiuke v. New
 
Jersey State Supreme Court, 435 F. Supp. 2d 394, 405 (D.N.J.
 2006) ("[L]awyers are not a suspect class for equal protection
 
purposes[.]"); Bertleson v. Sacks Tierney, P.A., 60 P.3d 703, 707
 
(Ariz. Ct. App. 2002) ("Lawyers are not a suspect class within
 
the meaning of equal protection jurisprudence.") (citation and
 
internal quotation marks omitted); Nodvin v. State Bar of
 
Georgia, 544 S.E.2d 142, 145 (Ga. 2001) ("attorneys are not a
 
protected 'suspect class'"); State ex rel. Oklahoma Bar Ass'n v.
 
Minter, 961 P.2d 208, 214 (Okla. 1998) ("Lawyers are not a
 
suspect class."); Williams v. Foubister, 673 N.Y.S.2d 840, 843
 
(N.Y. Co. Ct. 1998) (matrimonial lawyers not a suspect class). 
Fyffe's contention that the circuit court created a new suspect
 
class comprised of a subset of lawyers is meritless.
 
(4) The circuit court erred in awarding attorneys'
 
fees to Donnelly and Davis but did not err in awarding fees to
 
Hue.
 
Although generally each party pays its litigation 
expenses, if a statute, stipulation, or agreement so provides, a 
prevailing party may shift the fees to its opponent. TSA Int'l, 
Ltd. v. Shimizu Corp., 92 Hawai
ri 243, 263, 990 P.2d 713, 733 
(1999) (citations omitted). The circuit court relied on HRS 
§ 607-14 (Supp. 2004), which states that the losing party in 
assumpsit actions may be assessed the opposing parties' 
attorneys' fees. Because Fyffe's claims against Donnelly and 
Davis sounded in tort rather than assumpsit, the circuit court 
abused its discretion in granting fees to Davis and Donnelly 
under HRS § 607-14. Kahala Royal Corp. v. Goodsill Anderson 
Quinn & Stifel, 113 Hawai ri 251, 281-82, 151 P.3d 732, 762-63 
(2007). 
However, Fyffe demanded specific performance and
 
damages against Hue for breach of contract. Where specific
 
performance is the requested remedy, the action is not in the
 
nature of assumpsit and HRS § 607-14 does not apply. Smothers v.
 
5
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI rI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Renander, 2 Haw. App. 400, 404-05, 633 P.2d 556, 561 (1981). 
However, Fyffe's alternative prayer against Hue was for damages 
for the breach and also requested attorneys' fees, which "is a 
significant indication that the action is in assumpsit." Kahala 
Royal Corp., 113 Hawai ri at 281, 151 P.3d at 762 (citation 
omitted). In cases such as this, which involve both assumpsit 
and non-assumpsit claims, a court "must base its award of fees, 
if practicable, on an apportionment of the fees claimed between 
assumpsit and non-assumpsit claims." Blair v. Ing, 96 Hawai ri 
327, 332, 31 P.3d 184, 189 (2001) (emphasis omitted). The court must examine whether claims where attorneys' fees are allowed can 
be segregated from claims where they are not allowed, which can 
be done by looking at whether the claims "involve a common core 
of facts or are based on related legal theories." Porter v. Hu, 
116 Hawai
ri 42, 67-68, 169 P.3d 994, 1019-20 (App. 2007). 
Fyffe's demands for damages and specific performance were based 
on a common set of facts and argued simultaneously before the 
circuit court. As such, it would be "impracticable, if not 
impossible, to apportion the fees between the assumpsit and non­
assumpsit claims." Kahala Royal Corp., 113 Hawai ri at 282, 151 
P.3d at 763 (quoting Blair, 96 Hawai ri at 333, 31 P.3d at 190) 
(internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, the circuit 
court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorneys' fees to 
Hue. However, Hue's attorney, who also represented Davis, 
submitted a joint billing to the court in his request for 
attorneys fees, and the record does not reflect an apportionment 
between his clients' respective fees. Similarly, the record does 
2
 made
 not reflect what apportionment, if any, the circuit court
between the attorneys' fees attributable to the assumpsit claim
 
against Hue and the non-assumpsit claim against Davis.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the November 16,

 
2006 Final Judgment is AFFIRMED. The attorneys' fees awards to

Donnelly and Davis are vacated. The case is remanded for a 
redetermination of the attorneys' fee award to Hue.
