MEMORANDUM OPINION

 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
In a notice of appeal (NOA) filed on December 22, 2006
 
in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court),1/
 
Defendant/Counterclaim Plaintiff/Appellant The Way of Salvation
 
Church (Church) purports to appeal from the circuit court's (1)
 July 19, 2006 order granting partial summary judgment, in favor
 of Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant/Appellee James Kokualani
 (Kokualani) and against Church, on Kokualani's April 12, 2006
 complaint (July 19, 2006 SJ on the Complaint Order); (2)
 November 22, 2006 order denying Church's motion for
 reconsideration of the July 19, 2006 SJ on the Complaint Order
 (November 22, 2006 Order Denying Reconsideration of SJ on the
 Complaint); and (3) November 30, 2006 announced decision that it

 The Honorable Victoria S. Marks presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
was granting Kokualani's October 13, 2006 motion to enforce 
compliance with the July 19, 2006 SJ on the Complaint Order, and issuing a related Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 
54(b)-certified judgment under HRCP Rule 70. This appeal was assigned appeal no. 28331. 
In a second NOA filed in the circuit court on
 
December 24, 2007, Church purports to appeal from the circuit
 court's (1) February 7, 2007 order granting Kokualani's motion to
 dismiss Church's October 23, 2006 counterclaim with prejudice,
 or, in the alternative, for summary judgment (February 7, 2007
 Dismiss/SJ on the Counterclaim Order); (2) October 5, 2007 order
 granting Kokualani's second motion for HRCP Rule 54(b)
 certification of the February 7, 2007 Dismiss/SJ on the
 Counterclaim Order (October 5, 2007 Certification Order); (3)
 October 5, 2007 HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified judgment in favor of
 Kokualani and against Church regarding the February 7, 2007
 Dismiss/SJ on the Counterclaim Order and the October 5, 2007
 Certification Order (October 5, 2007 Certified Judgment); and
 (4) November 26, 2007 order denying Church's motion for
 reconsideration of the October 5, 2007 Certification Order and
 Certified Judgment. This appeal was assigned appeal no. 28919.
 
By order dated June 20, 2008, after appeal no. 28331
 
has been fully briefed, but before appeal no. 28919 had been
 briefed, this court consolidated the appeals under appeal no.
 28331.
 
Church appears to raise three points of error on this
 
consolidated appeal: (1) that the circuit court erred in awarding
 summary judgment on Kokualani's complaint in light of disputed
 material facts; (2) that the circuit court erred in awarding
 summary judgment on Church's counterclaim in light of disputed
 material facts; and (3) that it was erroneous for the circuit
 court to enforce the July 19, 2006 SJ on the Complaint Order in
 light of the circuit court's failure to issue (i) a separate HRCP
 Rule 58 judgment, (ii) an HRCP Rule 54(b) certification, or (iii)
 HRCP Rule 65(d) findings of fact.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude that the
 circuit court's award of summary judgment on the complaint is not
 properly before this court, the circuit court did not err in
 granting summary judgment on Church's counterclaim, and the
 circuit court did not err in granting Kokualani's motion to
 enforce the July 19, 2006 SJ on the Complaint Order.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
This case involves a dispute over the enforceability of 
a contract to sell real estate. Church was the owner of certain 
residential real property located in Wahiaw
a, Hawai 'i (Property), 
which was the subject of a Deposit Receipt Offer and Acceptance (DROA), whereby Kokualani offered to purchase the Property for $540,000. 
By letter dated November 11, 2005, Counterclaim
 
Defendant/Appellee Ronald Y. Amemiya (Amemiya), who was at the
 time employed as Church's attorney, advised Mariano C. Caneso
 (Caneso), Church's President, Director, and Pastor, of
 Kokualani's offer. Enclosed with the letter was a Multiple
 Listing Service listing for a neighboring property that had
 recently sold for $605,000. On November 12, 2005, the Church's
 board of directors unanimously approved the sale of the Property
 to Kokualani. On November 13, 2005, Caneso signed the DROA on
 behalf of the Church, accepting Kokualani's offer. 
Caneso subsequently appointed new members to the
 
Church's board of directors and terminated Amemiya's services. 
Church's new board of directors concluded that the Property's
 sale had been fraudulently induced, and amounted to theft of the
 Church's property. As a result, Church refused to cooperate in
 opening an escrow account relating to the sale of the Property,
 refused to permit closing of the sale of the Property to
 Kokualani, and directed that the Property should be appraised. 
Kokualani filed a complaint seeking specific
 
performance and damages on April 12, 2006. On May 24, 2006,
 Kokualani filed a motion for summary judgment on the complaint. 
The circuit court granted the motion, and entered the July 19,
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2006 SJ on the Complaint Order, which ordered Church to perform
 
its obligations under the DROA. Church, nevertheless, failed to
 perform its obligations under the DROA.
 
On October 13, 2006, Kokualani filed a motion to
 
enforce the July 19, 2006 SJ on the Complaint Order (October 13,
 2006 Motion to Enforce). On October 23, 2006, Church filed an
 answer to the complaint and a counterclaim seeking rescission of
 the DROA, alleging that Kokualani and Amemiya had conspired to
 defraud Church.
 
On November 13, 2006, Kokualani filed a motion to
 
dismiss the counterclaim with prejudice or, in the alternative,
 for summary judgment (November 13, 2006 Motion to Dismiss/SJ). 
On November 30, 2006, the circuit court announced that it would
 grant the October 13, 2006 Motion to Enforce. On December 22,
 2006, Church filed the NOA initiating appeal no. 28331. 
Subsequently, on December 26, 2006, the circuit court
 
issued the written order granting the October 13, 2006 Motion to
 Enforce and requiring the Clerk of the Circuit Court to execute
 and deliver a deed to the Property to Kokualani pursuant to HRCP
 Rule 70
2/ (December 26, 2006 Enforcement Order). Thereafter, the
 
circuit court issued the February 7, 2007 Dismiss/SJ on the
 Counterclaim Order, granting the November 13, 2006 Motion to
 Dismiss/SJ and dismissing the counterclaim against Kokualani. 
Before that, however, on January 12, 2007 and
 
January 17, 2007, Church filed notices of pendency of action
 (NOPA) in the circuit court and the Intermediate Court of Appeals
 (ICA), respectively, against the Property. Having been informed
 that the NOPAs would have the effect of preventing completion of
 the sale, Kokualani filed a motion to expunge the two NOPAs in
 the circuit court on February 9, 2007. 
2/
 HRCP Rule 70 provides, in pertinent part, that:
 
If a judgment directs a party to execute a conveyance of
land or to deliver deeds . . . and the party fails to comply
within the time specified, the court may direct the act to be done
at the cost of the disobedient party by some other person
appointed by the court[.] 
Haw. R. Civ. P.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On March 7, 2007, the circuit court granted the motion
 
to expunge the NOPA filed in circuit court. Kokualani filed a
 
motion to expunge in the ICA, but on May 30, 2007, the ICA denied
 the motion without prejudice to Kokualani seeking further relief
 
3/
upon entry of an HRCP Rule 54(b)  final judgment. 
On June 6, 2007, Kokualani filed a motion for an HRCP
 
Rule 54(b) certification of the February 7, 2007 Dismiss/SJ on
 the Counterclaim Order. On August 23, 2007, this court remanded
 the case to the circuit court for the limited purpose of hearing
 and determining Kokualani's motion for an HRCP Rule 54(b)
 certification of the February 7, 2007 Dismiss/SJ on the
 Counterclaim Order. On August 28, 2007, Kokualani filed a second
 motion for an HRCP Rule 54(b) certification. On October 5, 2007,
 the circuit court issued (1) the Certification Order granting
 Kokualani's second motion for an HRCP Rule 54(b) certification of
 the February 7, 2007 Dismiss/SJ on the Counterclaim Order, and
 (2) the Certified Judgment. 
On October 15, 2007, Church filed a motion for
 
reconsideration of the October 5, 2007 Certification Order and
 Certified Judgment. The circuit court issued an order denying
 Church's motion for reconsideration on November 26, 2007. Church
 then filed the second NOA on December 24, 2007, initiating appeal
 no. 28919. 
II.	 JURISDICTION
 
A.	 July 19, 2006 SJ on the Complaint Order and the
November 22, 2006 Order Denying Reconsideration of SJ
on the Complaint
 
Although summary judgment on the complaint was awarded
 
to Kokualani, no related final judgment or HRCP Rule 54(b)­
3/
 HRCP Rule 54(b) provides, in part, that:
 
When more than one claim for relief is presented in an action,
whether as a claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party
claim, or when multiple parties are involved, the court may direct
the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all
of the claims or parties only upon an express determination that
there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction
for the entry of judgment. 
Haw. R. Civ. P. (2000).

4/
certified order was issued.  As a result, this Court does not 
have jurisdiction over Church's appeal from the July 19, 2006 SJ 
on the Complaint Order. Although the July 19, 2006 SJ on the Complaint Order was appealable under the doctrine enunciated in Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848), which "allows an appellant to immediately appeal a judgment for execution upon property, even if all claims of the parties have not been finally resolved[,]" Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai
'i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 
704 (1995), Church did not assert a timely appeal. 
Church initially extended the time to file an NOA from 
the July 19, 2006 SJ on the Complaint Order by timely filing its August 1, 2006 motion for reconsideration. 
Pursuant to Hawai 'i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 4(a)(3),5/ however, this 
motion was deemed denied on October 30, 2006. Although the circuit court entered an order denying Church's motion for reconsideration on November 22, 2006, that order was a nullity. Church did not file the first NOA until December 22, 2006, which is more than thirty days after October 30, 2006. Therefore, Church's appeal was untimely as to the July 19, and November 22, 2006 orders. 
The failure to file a timely NOA in a civil matter is a
 
jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot waive and the
 appellate court cannot disregard. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648,
 
650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1129 (1986); Haw. R. App. P. 26(b) (2000).
 
4/
 After the hearing on Kokualani's October 13, 2006 Motion to
Enforce, Kokualani submitted a proposed order and judgment that included HRCP
Rule 54(b) certification. Church objected to including HRCP Rule 54(b)
certification in the order. In response, Kokualani submitted a revised order
excluding HRCP Rule 54(b) certification. 
5/
 HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) provides, in relevant part, that:
 
If any party files a timely motion . . . to reconsider,
alter or amend the judgment or order, . . . the time for filing
the notice of appeal is extended until 30 days after entry of an
order disposing of the motion; provided, that the failure to
dispose of any motion by order entered upon the record within 90
days after the date the motion was filed shall constitute a denial
of the motion.
 
The notice of appeal shall be deemed to appeal the
disposition of all post-judgment motions that are timely filed
after entry of the judgment or order.
 
Haw. R. App. P. (2006).

B.	 November 30, 2006 Announced Decisions Granting
Kokualani's October 13, 2006 Motion To Enforce And To
Issue Rule 54(b)-Certified Judgment; December 26, 2006
Enforcement Order
 
Although the first NOA purports to appeal from the 
circuit court's November 30, 2006 announced decisions to grant 
Kokualani's October 13, 2006 Motion to Enforce and to award Kokualani Rule 54(b)-certified judgment against Church, "[a] judgment or order is entered when it is filed in the office of the clerk of the court." Haw. R. App. P. 4(a)(5). Just as "a minute order is not an appealable order", Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai
'i 319, 321 n.3, 966 P.2d 631, 
633 n.3 (1998), neither do we have jurisdiction over the November 30, 2006 announced decisions. 
We do, however, have jurisdiction over the December 26,
 
2006 Enforcement Order granting the October 13, 2006 Motion to
 Enforce. "If a notice of appeal is filed after announcement of a
 decision but before entry of the judgment or order, such notice
 shall be considered as filed immediately after the time the
 judgment or order becomes final for the purpose of appeal." Haw.
 R. App. P. 4(a)(2). Pursuant to Forgay, which allows the
 immediate appeal of an order requiring the execution of a command
 that real property be transferred, this court has jurisdiction
 over an appeal from the December 26, 2006 Enforcement Order.
 
C.	 February 7, 2007 Dismiss/SJ on the Counterclaim Order;
October 5, 2007 Certification Order; and October 5,
2007 Certified Judgment
 
The October 5, 2007 Certified Judgment does not resolve
 
all claims against all parties, but does resolve Church's
 
counterclaim against Kokualani, and contains the express findings
 necessary for certification of the February 7, 2007 Dismiss/SJ on
 the Counterclaim Order under HRCP Rule 54(b). Therefore, the
 October 5, 2007 Certified Judgment, the February 7, 2007
 Dismiss/SJ on the Counterclaim Order, the October 5, 2007
 Certification Order, and the November 26, 2007 Reconsideration
 Order are all reviewable in this appeal. See Ueoka v. Szymanski,

107 Hawai 'i 386, 396, 114 P.3d 892, 902 (2005) ("An appeal from a 
final judgment 'brings up for review all interlocutory orders not 
appealable directly as of right which deal with issues in the case.'" (quoting Pioneer Mill Co. v. Ward, 34 Haw. 686, 694 (1938)); Haw. R. App. P. 4(a)(3) ("The notice of appeal shall be deemed to appeal the disposition of all post-judgment motions that are timely filed after entry of the judgment or order."). 
III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
A. Summary Judgment
 
The appellate court reviews "the circuit court's grant
 
or denial of summary judgment de novo." Querubin v. Thronas, 107
 
Hawai
'i 48, 56, 109 P.3d 689, 697 (2005) (quoting Durette v. 
Aloha Plastic Recycling, Inc., 105 Hawai 'i 490, 501, 100 P.3d 60, 
71 (2004)). 
The Hawai 'i Supreme Court has explained that the 
standard for granting summary judgment is settled:
 
[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions,
answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with
the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to
any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law. A fact is material if proof of that
fact would have the effect of establishing or refuting one of the
essential elements of a cause of action or defense asserted by the
parties. The evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable
to the non-moving party. 
Querubin, 107 Hawai 'i at 56, 109 P.3d at 697 (quoting Durette, 
105 Hawai 'i at 501, 100 P.3d at 71).
 The Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure require that: 
When a motion for summary judgment is made . . . , an adverse
party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the
adverse party's pleading, but the adverse party's response, by
affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth
specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.
If the adverse party does not so respond, summary judgment, if
appropriate, shall be entered against the adverse party.
 
Haw. R. Civ. P. 56(e) (2000). Thus, "[a] party opposing a motion
 
for summary judgment cannot discharge his or her burden by
 alleging conclusions, 'nor is [the party] entitled to a trial on
 the basis of a hope that [the party] can produce some evidence at
 that time.'" Henderson v. Prof'l Coatings Corp., 72 Haw. 387,
 401, 819 P.2d 84, 92 (1991) (quoting 10A Charles Alan Wright,
 
8
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure
 
§ 2727 (2d ed. 1983)).
 
B.	 Dismissal of a Complaint/Counterclaim
 
The appellate court reviews a dismissal under HRCP Rule 
12(b)(6)6/ de novo. Bacerra v. MacMillan, 111 Hawai 'i 117, 119, 
138 P.3d 749, 751 (2006). 
C.	 Questions of Law
 Questions of law are reviewed upon appeal under the 
right/wrong standard of review. Maile Sky Court Co., Ltd. v. 
City & County of Honolulu, 85 Hawai
'i 36, 39, 936 P.2d 672, 675 
(1997). 
IV.	 DISCUSSION
 
A.	 The Circuit Court's Award Of Summary Judgment On The
Complaint Is Not Properly Before This Court
 
Church's first point of error contends that the circuit 
court's award of summary judgment to Kokualani on the complaint 
was improper in light of certain disputed issues of material fact. As discussed, supra at 6-7, Church did not assert a timely appeal from the July 19, 2006 SJ on the Complaint Order or the de facto October 30, 2006 denial of Church's August 1, 2006 motion for reconsideration. As such, we have no jurisdiction over any order or judgment by which we might presently address Church's first point of error.
7/ Leslie v. Estate of Tavares, 109 Hawai 'i 
8, 12-14, 122 P.3d 803, 807-09 (2005) (alleged points of error for which the court lacks appellate jurisdiction will be 
6/
 "Every defense, in law or fact, to a claim for relief in any
pleading . . . may at the option of the pleader be made by motion: . . . 
(6) [for] failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted[.]"
 
Haw. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) (2000). 
7/
 In addition, although raising the issue of disputed issues of
material fact as to the complaint as a point of error, Church did not address
the issue in its legal argument. As such, the point would in any event bedeemed waived. "Points not argued may be deemed waived." Haw. R. App. P.
28(b)(7) (2006); Citicorp Mortgage, Inc. v. Bartolome, 94 Hawai' i 422, 433, 16
P.3d 827, 838 (App. 2000) ("An appellate court does not have to address
matters for which the appellant has failed to present a discernibleargument."). 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
dismissed).
 
Although we retain jurisdiction over the circuit 
court's December 26, 2006 Enforcement Order, that order does not 
provide us with the ability to address any of the issues raised by Church with specific regard to the merits of the circuit court's grant of summary judgment on the complaint. "A proceeding to enforce a judgment is collateral to the judgment, and therefore no inquiry into its regularity or validity can be permitted in such a proceeding." Kim v. Reilly, 105 Hawai
'i 93, 
97, 94 P.3d 648, 652 (2004) (quoting Royal Int'l Optical Co. v. Tex. State Optical Co., 586 P.2d 318, 322 (N.M. Ct. App. 1978)). "[A] party may defend against the execution, but not by attacking the judgment[.]" Id. (original brackets omitted) (quoting 
Gabbert v. Bd. of Review for Okla. Emp't Sec. Comm'n, 943 P.2d 158, 160 (Okla. Civ. App. 1997)). 
B.	 The Circuit Court Did Not Err In Granting Summary
Judgment On Church's Counterclaim
 
Church's second point of error contends that it was
 
erroneous for the circuit court to grant summary judgment in
 
favor of Kokualani on the counterclaim because of certain
 disputed issues of material fact. As a threshold matter, we
 observe that, although the circuit court purported to grant
 Kokualani's motion to dismiss, the order itself stated that the
 court, in issuing its ruling, considered the motion and
 supporting documents, Church's opposition, the oral argument of
 counsel and the files and records of the case. As such, it is
 appropriate on appeal to consider the order as having granted
 summary judgment. See Richards v. Midkiff, 48 Haw. 32, 38, 396
 
P.2d 49, 54 (1964). 
In Gonzalves v. First Ins. Co. of Hawaii, 55 Haw. 155, 
516 P.2d 720 (1973), the Hawai
'i Supreme Court held that where a 
trial court considered a memorandum of law and a supporting affidavit in determining the merits of the motion, the order granting the motion was one for summary judgment and not a motion to dismiss. Id. at 159-60, 516 P.2d at 723. "This court is not 
foreclosed from recognizing the true nature of an order by the 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
label put upon it by the circuit court." Id. at 160, 516 P.2d at
 
723.
 
In its argument, Church refers to "the existence of
 
numerous incriminating circumstantial facts, as detailed above,
 
especially those arising from Mr. Kokualani's sworn deposition
 testimony," as evidence of error. Church makes no attempt in its
 argument, however, to identify the specific factual issues,
 describe how they are disputed, or explain how they are material
 to resolution of the counterclaim. 
The counterclaim addresses two counts against
 
Kokualani: rescission and fraud. Rescission is not a cause of
 action, but a remedy, which Church contends is warranted in light
 of the alleged fraud by Kokualani "attempting to steal [Church's]
 Wahiawa property for less than fair market value[.]" Church
 makes only three allegations of fact in the counterclaim that
 appear directed against Kokualani:
 
(1) After Caneso signed the DROA, Amemiya continued to
write to Caneso, on behalf of Kokualani, and Caneso's
wife, pushing for the concluding of the sale;
 
(2) Church was concerned that Amemiya was acting in concert
with Kokualani, and Church therefore sought a second
opinion from other attorneys;
 
(3) Amemiya, on behalf of Kokualani, sent Caneso formal
papers to open escrow on the Property. 
In its motion to dismiss the counterclaim or, in the
 
alternative, for summary judgment, Kokualani contended that
 
judgment was warranted because the counterclaim was untimely
 filed, that the July 19, 2006 SJ on the Complaint Order is "the
 law of the case" and should bar Church from re-litigating
 Church's fraud claim, and Church's claim of fraud is barred by
 judicial estoppel. Church's opposition to the motion focused, as
 it does now on appeal, on information developed during
 Kokualani's deposition, which, Church contends, "revealed
 numerous inconsistencies and false statements made by
 [Kokualani.]" Church refers to four examples of these
 inconsistencies, specifically addressing whether Kokualani saw
 the Property before or after he signed the DROA, who told him
 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
about the Property, his source of payment, and whether he typed
 
up the DROA himself. 
The circuit court was unpersuaded, stating that:
 
[M]y inclination is to grant [Kokualani's] motion to dismiss the
counterclaim. In addition to the procedural problems that are in
place, there's really no genuine question of material fact that's
been raised. . . . 
. . . . 
. . . You haven't given me any facts that would create a
material question of fact to show that Mr. Kokualani engaged in
fraud. You've given me lots of arguments, but no facts.
 
. . . .
 
. . . [T]he point here is that there's a motion for summary
judgment brought by Mr. Kokualani on your counterclaim, and you
needed to respond with facts demonstrating the fraud. And in the
 Court's view, you have failed to raise sufficient facts
demonstrating the fraud as alleged in the two counts of the
counterclaim.
 
. . . .
 
. . . So for the reasons I've just stated, the motion is
granted.
 
We agree that Church presented facts (in addition to
 
argument and conclusions) and, in many instances, those facts
 
were disputed. We agree, also, however, that none of those facts
 have the effect of establishing or refuting any of the essential
 elements of a cause of action or defense asserted by the parties. 
In other words, they are not material. "[T]he existence of
 disputed factual issues in the record itself is not dispositive
 of a pending motion for summary judgment." Wilder v. Tanouye, 7
 
Haw. App. 247, 254, 753 P.2d 816, 821 (1988). "[A] factual issue
 that is not necessary to the decision is not material . . . and a
 motion for summary judgment may be granted without regard to
 whether it is in dispute." 10A Charles Alan Wright, et al.,
 supra § 2725 at 95.
 
Church argues on appeal that the "numerous material
 
facts in genuine dispute" as described in its opening brief and,
 in particular, as disclosed in Kokualani's deposition, preclude
 summary judgment. Because we agree that Church failed to
 establish genuine issues of disputed material fact as to its
 
12
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
claim of fraud in the counterclaim,8/ and that those facts that
 
were adduced were not material to Church's decision to enter into
 
the DROA, we conclude that the circuit court correctly granted
 Kokualani's motion for summary judgment on Church's counterclaim.
 
C.	 The Circuit Court Did Not Err In Granting Kokualani's
October 13, 2006 Motion To Enforce
 
Church's third point of error contends that the circuit
 
court erred by ordering mandatory injunctive enforcement of the
 
July 19, 2006 SJ on the Complaint Order without: (a) a separate
 
9/
HRCP Rule 58 judgment;  (b) any attempt at certification under
HRCP Rule 54(b); and (c) issuing findings of fact as required

 
under HRCP Rule 65(d).10/  Church's legal argument on these issues
 
consists of three paragraphs in its opening brief, two of which
 appear not to touch upon the error described in its point of
 error.
11/
 
8/
 Church did not adduce facts that, even if true, would support a
claim of fraudulent inducement, sufficient to invalidate the terms of a
 
contract. Specifically, Church's alleged facts did not bear upon whether
Kokualani: (1) made a misrepresentation of a material fact; (2) for the
purpose of inducing Church to act; (3) that was known to be false by
Kokualani, but reasonably believed to be true by Church; and (4) upon which
Church relied and acted to its detriment. See Laeroc Waikiki Parkside v.
 
K.S.K. (Oahu), 115 Hawai' i 201, 216, 166 P.3d 961, 976 (2007); TSA Int'l. Ltd. 
v. Shimizu Corp., 92 Hawai' i 243, 255, 990 P.2d 713, 725 (1999).

 HRCP Rule 58 provides that: "Unless the court otherwise directs
and subject to the provisions of Rule 54(b), judgment upon the verdict of a
jury shall be entered forthwith by the clerk[.] . . . Every judgment shall be
set forth on a separate document." Haw. R. Civ. P. (1990).
 
10/
 HRCP Rule 65(d) provides, in part: 
Every order granting an injunction and every restraining
order shall set forth the reasons for its issuance; shall be
specific in terms; shall describe in reasonable detail, and not by
reference to the complaint or other document, the act or acts
sought to be restrained[.] 
Haw. R. Civ. P. (2000). 
11/
 Paragraph 42 of the Opening Brief expands upon the issue addressed
in the point of error (that the enforcement was issued without an HRCP Rule
54(b) certification or HRCP Rule 65(d) findings of fact), but makes no
reference to the HRCP Rule 58 judgment issue. Paragraph 43 offers three case
citations, introduced by the signal "See, [sic] e.g.," which suggests that
Church intends these three cases to support the proposition(s) advanced in
paragraph 42. They do not appear to support those propositions, however,
focusing on whether the underlying summary judgment was warranted in light of
alleged issues of disputed material fact, and whether summary judgment on the
complaint was premature until the counterclaim was resolved. Paragraph 44
 
13

The circuit court's order was properly issued under
 
HRCP Rule 70. For the circuit court to order execution of a
 
conveyance of land under HRCP Rule 70, it is necessary that there
 was a judgment ordering a party to the action to convey land. 
The July 19, 2006 SJ on the Complaint Order was such an order.
 
Church's first contention that enforcement requires a 
separate HRCP Rule 58 judgment, though stated as a point of error, is not argued or explained in the legal argument section of the opening brief. "Points not argued may be deemed waived." Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(7). Therefore, we deem the argument to have been waived. See Aames Funding Corp. v. Mores, 107 Hawai
'i 
95, 104, 110 P.3d 1042, 1051 (2005) (points for which no factual or legal argument is offered will be deemed waived). 
Church's second contention, that enforcement should be 
denied since the underlying order was not certified under HRCP Rule 54(b), is unpersuasive. On its face, HRCP Rule 70 requires only that the court had previously entered a "judgment direct[ing] a party to execute a conveyance of land or to deliver deeds[.]" Haw. R. Civ. P. 70; see Matter of Lease Cancellation of Smith, 68 Haw. 466, 470-71, 719 P.2d 397, 401 (1986) ("[HRCP Rule 70] writs issue when the party seeking relief alleges noncompliance with an order of the court."); Gamino v. Greenwell, 2 Haw. App. 59, 60, 625 P.2d 1055, 1057 (1981) (because court had entered order for sale of real property, court had authority to effectuate sale under analogous Hawai
'i Family Court Rules, Rule 
70). HRCP Rule 54(a) defines a "judgment" as "a decree and any order from which an appeal lies." As explained above, the July 19, 2006 SJ on the Complaint Order was immediately appealable under the Forgay doctrine. Thus, it was a judgment under HRCP Rule 54(a) and the court had the authority to enforce it under HRCP Rule 70.
12/ 
argues that HRCP Rule 54(b) certification is inappropriate, although the
motion to enforce does not request or involve an HRCP Rule 54(b)
certification. 
12/
 Church's argument is ironic since Kokualani submitted a proposed
form of order granting the October 13, 2006 Motion to Enforce that included an
HRCP Rule 54(b) certification, but Church filed a notice of opposition, objecting
to the certification. See supra at 6, n. 4.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Church's third contention, that enforcement was
 
inappropriate because the December 26, 2006 Enforcement Order was 
not supported by findings of fact under Rule 65(d), is equally unpersuasive. HRCP Rule 65(d) merely requires that an injunctive order specifically set forth the reasons for its issuance and describe in detail, without reference to the complaint, the acts mandated by the order. Church has not explained how the December 26, 2006 Enforcement Order fails to satisfy these requirements. On its face, the December 26, 2006 Enforcement Order includes all necessary information. See Moffat v. Speidel, 
2 Haw. App. 334, 335-37, 631 P.2d 1205, 1206-08 (1981); Combs v. Ryan's Coal Co., 785 F.2d 970, 978-79 (11th Cir. 1986) (an order satisfies requirements of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) Rule 65(d) when language is specific enough to provide notice of obligations and allow appellate review); Wahba, LLC v. USRP (Don), LLC, 106 Hawai
'i 466, 475-76, 106 P.3d 1109, 1118-19 
(2005) (federal court interpretations of FRCP Rule 65(d) are highly persuasive). As such, Church's HRCP Rule 65(d) argument is without merit. 
V. CONCLUSION
 
For the aforementioned reasons, we affirm (1) the
 
December 26, 2006 Enforcement Order that granted Kokualani's
 
October 13, 2006 Motion to Enforce and (2) the October 5, 2007 
Certified Judgment, entered in the Circuit Court of the First
 Circuit.
