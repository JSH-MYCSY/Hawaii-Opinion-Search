STATE OF HAWAI I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
EVE CRESPO, Defendant-Appellant»
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(FC-CR. No. 06-1-2123)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Eve Crespo (Crespo) appeals from
the January 12, 2007 judgment of the Family Court of the First
Circuit (family court)1 that found her guilty of Harassment,
under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ÿÿ 711-1106(1)(a)
(Supp. 2006).
On October 6, 2006, Crespo was charged by complaint
with Harassment2 of her husband (Husband).  At the time of the
incident on October 4, 2006, the two were getting a divorce.  
The couple had argued earlier in the day and Crespo left the
apartment around 5 p.m.  Husband claims that Crespo hit him in
the evening as he slept.
Crespo argues on appeal that:  (1) the court's findings
of facts and conclusions of law numbered 6, 7, 8, 9 and 12 were
not supported by the testimony or the evidence produced at trial
and (2) the court erred in rejecting Crespo's alibi defense when
the State failed to present credible evidence negating the
defense.
  After careful review of the issues raised, the
arguments made by the parties, the applicable law as well as theNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2record of the proceedings before the family court, we resolve
Crespo's points on appeal as follows:
1.  The family court's findings of fact were not
clearly erroneous because the record shows there is substantial
evidence to support the findings.  State v. Locquiao , 100 Hawai i
195, 203, 58 P.3d 1242, 1250 (2002).  "The testimony of a single
witness, if found credible by the trier of fact, may constitute
substantial evidence to support a conviction."  State v.
Montgomery , 103 Hawai i 373, 381, 82 P.3d 818, 826 (App. 2003). »
»
Finding No. 7 is supported by Husband's testimony that
he saw Crespo between ten and fifteen feet away from him after he
was hit and that she was the only other person in the apartment. 
Husband's testimony also provides substantial evidence for
finding No. 8 that he "woke up and asked [Crespo] why she hit
him."  Finding No. 9, that Husband "felt pain as a result of
being hit by [Crespo]," is supported by Husband's testimony that
he was in pain after being struck on the head and the reasonable
inference from his testimony that it was Crespo who hit him. 
Therefore, the family court's findings were not clearly
erroneous.
  The family court's conclusion that "at the time she
punched [Husband, Crespo] did so with the intent to harass,
annoy, or alarm" is supported by sufficient evidence.  "Given the
difficulty of proving the requisite state of mind by direct
evidence in criminal cases, proof by circumstantial evidence and
reasonable inferences arising from circumstances surrounding the
defendant's conduct is sufficient."  State v. Agard , 113 Hawai i
321, 324, 151 P.3d 802, 805 (2007) (internal quotation marks and
citation omitted).  Because the court reasonably found that
Crespo hit Husband while he was sleeping and in a manner strong
enough to cause pain, the family court could infer that she
intended to "harass, annoy, or alarm" him.  Therefore, the family
court's conclusion that Crespo committed the crime of harassment
was not erroneous.»NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
3Crespo also challenges finding No. 7 on the basis that
Husband did not testify that he was hit on the top of his head.  
The precise location of the hit is inconsequential.  Finding No.
6, that Crespo "returned to the residence while Defendant [sic]
was asleep on the couch in the living room[,]" was admittedly a
typographic error.  In light of the entire record, errors in
findings No. 6 and 7 were harmless.  See  State v. Propios , 76
Hawai i 474, 486, 879 P.2d 1057, 1069 (1994) (erroneous finding
of fact was harmless error).»
2.  The family court did not err by "rejecting"
Crespo's alibi defense based on the credibility of the witnesses. 
Although Crespo claims the family court "rejected" her alibi
defense, the record shows that witnesses testified supporting and
contradicting Crespo's alibi.  Given the conflicting testimony in
this case, the judge "had to decide whether to believe the victim
or the alibi witnesses."  State v. Marsh , 68 Haw. 659, 661, 728
P.2d 1301, 1302 (1986).  It is apparent that the family court
believed Husband to be more credible than Crespo and her alibi
witness.  "The appellate court will neither reconcile conflicting
evidence nor interfere with the decision of the trier of fact
based on the witnesses' credibility or the weight of the
evidence."  State v. Medeiros , 80 Hawai i 251, 262, 909 P.2d 579,
590 (App. 1995). »
Therefore,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the January 12, 2007 judgment
of Family Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
