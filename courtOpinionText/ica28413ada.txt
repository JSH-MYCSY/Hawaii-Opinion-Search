OPINION OF THE COURT BY NAKAMURA, C.J.
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Amy M. Lee (Lee), a public
 
employee, filed suit against her employer, Defendant-Appellee
 
State of Hawai 'i, Department of Public Safety (DPS or State), and 
her union, Defendant-Appellee United Public Workers AFSCME, Local
 646, AFL-CIO (UPW). Lee's complaint alleged a "hybrid action"
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
against (1) the State for breaching the collective bargaining 
agreement by wrongfully terminating her and (2) UPW for breaching its duty of fair representation by "declining to pursue" her grievance for wrongful termination against the State. Lee filed her hybrid-action complaint in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court) without first seeking relief before the Hawai
'i Labor Relations Board (HLRB). The Circuit Court1/ 
dismissed Lee's complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. 
The principal issue raised in this appeal is whether
 
the HLRB has exclusive original jurisdiction over Lee's hybrid
 action or shares concurrent jurisdiction with the circuit courts. 
We hold that the HLRB has exclusive original jurisdiction over
 Lee's hybrid action and thus the Circuit Court properly dismissed
 Lee's lawsuit for lack of jurisdiction. We also hold that the
 Circuit Court did not err in limiting its award of attorney's
 fees against UPW to one-half of the $1,480 in fees incurred by
 Lee in pursuing a default judgment against both UPW and the
 State. 
BACKGROUND
 
Lee was employed by the DPS as an adult correctional
 
officer (ACO) at the Women's Community Correctional Center (WCCC)
 and was a member of UPW. In 2000, Lee sustained work-related
 injuries to her left shoulder and back. Lee underwent surgery
 for these injuries in 2002. As a result of Lee's injuries, Lee's
 treating physician certified that Lee was permanently unable to
 perform her usual and customary duties as an ACO. Lee chose to
 return to temporary light duty at WCCC and to participate in the
 State's Return to Work Priority Program, under which she would be
 subject to termination if a job search to place her in an
 alternative position was unsuccessful. In 2003, the State
 terminated Lee's employment after advising her that a search
 under the program for suitable state jobs had been unsuccessful. 
1 The Honorable Bert I. Ayabe presided.

  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
In response to her termination, Lee requested that UPW
 
pursue a grievance against the State pursuant to the collective
 
bargaining agreement (CBA) between the State and UPW. In
 December 2003, UPW filed a grievance on Lee's behalf with the
 "Department Head" of the DPS. In May 2005, the Acting Director
 of the DPS submitted the DPS's decision denying the grievance. 
In August 2005, UPW notified Lee that based on its review of the
 matter, it had decided not to pursue her grievance any further. 
Under the applicable grievance procedures of the CBA, only UPW,
 and not the employee, had the authority to further pursue a
 grievance denied by the State by submitting the grievance to
 binding arbitration. 
On February 9, 2006, Lee filed a civil complaint in the
 
Circuit Court asserting a hybrid action against both the State
 and UPW. Lee alleged that the State was liable for breach of
 "contract" (presumably the CBA) and for breach of its duty of
 good faith and fair dealing. Lee alleged that UPW breached its
 duty of fair representation, its duty of good faith and fair
 dealing, and its contract with Lee to be the exclusive
 representative of Lee under the CBA by "declining to pursue"
 Lee's grievance regarding her termination against the State. Lee
 further alleged that "[t]he conduct of the Defendant was
 malicious[.]" 
An entry of default was filed against UPW and the State
 
for failure to answer the complaint. Lee then filed a motion for
 entry of default judgment against both UPW and the State. 
Subsequently, Lee stipulated with the State to set aside the
 State's default. The Circuit Court also granted UPW's motion to
 set aside UPW's default on the condition that UPW pay the
 necessary and reasonable fees and costs incurred by Lee in
 pursuing the motion for entry of default judgment as against UPW. 
The Circuit Court awarded Lee $6.14 in costs and $740 in
 attorney's fees, which was one-half of the attorney's fees sought
 by Lee, because "[Lee]'s request for entry of default judgment
 was also initially brought against the State."

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
The State and UPW filed motions to dismiss Lee's
 
hybrid-action complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. 
Both argued that the Circuit Court lacked jurisdiction based on
 
2/
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 89-14 (1993),  which grants the
HLRB exclusive original jurisdiction over controversies
 concerning prohibited practices. They further argued that Vaca
 v. Sipes, 386 U.S. 171 (1967), which Lee relied upon as a basis
 for the Circuit Court's jurisdiction, was inapplicable to Lee's
 case. 
The Circuit Court ruled that under HRS § 89-14, the
 
HLRB had exclusive original jurisdiction over Lee's hybrid action
 and that Vaca v. Sipes was inapplicable to Lee's case. The
 Circuit Court granted UPW's and the State's respective motions to
 dismiss, and it entered a Judgment against Lee and in favor of
 UPW and the State. Lee appeals from this Judgment. 
On appeal, Lee argues that the Circuit Court erred in 
1) dismissing her hybrid action against UPW and the State for
 lack of jurisdiction; and 2) limiting the amount of attorney's
 fees it awarded to Lee in setting aside the default entered
 against UPW. We disagree and affirm the Circuit Court.
 
DISCUSSION
 
I.
 
2 Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 89-14 provides:
 
§89-14. Prevention of prohibited practices. Any
controversy concerning prohibited practices may be
submitted to the board in the same manner and with the
 same effect as provided in section 377-9; provided that
the board shall have exclusive original jurisdiction
over such a controversy except that nothing herein
shall preclude (1) the institution of appropriate
proceedings in circuit court pursuant to section
89-12(e) or (2) the judicial review of decisions or
orders of the board in prohibited practice
controversies in accordance with section 377-9 and
 chapter 91. All references in section 377-9 to "labor
 organization" shall include employee organization.

Lee challenges the Circuit Court's dismissal of her 
hybrid action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. "The 
existence of jurisdiction is a question of law that we review de novo under the right/wrong standard." Captain Andy's Sailing, 
Inc., v. Dep't of Land and Natural Res., 113 Hawai
'i 184, 192, 
150 P.3d 833, 841 (2006) (citation and alteration omitted). 
The central question presented in this appeal is 
whether the HLRB has exclusive original jurisdiction over the hybrid action brought by Lee, a State public-sector employee. We answer this question in the affirmative. We conclude that: (1) the Hawai
'i Legislature, pursuant to HRS § 89-14, has granted the 
HLRB exclusive original jurisdiction over controversies concerning public-sector prohibited practices; (2) Lee's public-sector hybrid action concerns alleged prohibited practices covered by HRS Chapter 89; (3) Lee's reliance on Vaca v. Sipes, 386 U.S. at 171 is misplaced; and (4) HRS § 89-14 did not violate Lee's constitutional rights by conferring exclusive original jurisdiction over Lee's public-sector hybrid action upon the HLRB. Accordingly, Lee's hybrid action was within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the HLRB, and the Circuit Court did not have jurisdiction, in the first instance, to entertain Lee's hybrid action. 
A.
 
It is "well-settled that an employee must exhaust any 
grievance procedures provided under a collective bargaining agreement before bringing a court action pursuant to the agreement." Poe v. Hawai
'i Labor Relations Bd., 105 Hawai 'i 97, 
101, 94 P.3d 652, 656 (2004) (hereinafter, "Poe II") (internal quotation marks, ellipsis points, and citation omitted). In certain collective bargaining agreements, such as the one in Lee's case, the grievance procedures provide that the final grievance step, pursing binding arbitration, rests solely with the union. Thus, Lee could not exhaust the grievance procedures under the CBA for her wrongful-termination grievance without UPW's concurrence.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
"However, when the union wrongfully refuses to pursue
 
an individual grievance, the employee is not left without
 
recourse." Id. at 102, 94 P.3d at 657. A "wrongfully discharged
 
employee may bring an action against his [or her] employer in the
 face of a defense based upon the failure to exhaust contractual
 remedies, provided the employee can prove that the union as
 bargaining agent breached its duty of fair representation in its
 handling of the employee's grievance." Id. (quoting Vaca, 386
 
U.S. at 186).
 
Such an action, known as a "hybrid action," "consists
 
of two separate claims: (1) a claim against the employer alleging
 a breach of the collective bargaining agreement and (2) a claim
 against the union for breach of the duty of fair representation." 
Id. These two claims are "inextricably interdependent," in that
 
for an employee alleging wrongful termination to prevail against
 either the employer or the union, the employee must not only show
 that his or her termination violated the collective bargaining
 agreement, but must also show that the union breached its duty of
 fair representation by not pursuing the employee's grievance. 
Id. 
In order to establish the union's breach of its duty of 
fair representation, an employee alleging wrongful termination, such as Lee, must do more than show that he or she had been wrongfully terminated. Vaca, 386 U.S. at 193. A union breaches 
its duty of fair representation "only when [the] union's conduct toward a member of the collective bargaining unit is arbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith." Vaca, 386 U.S. at 190; see Poe 
II, 105 Hawai
'i at 104, 94 P.3d at 659 ("A union breaches its 
duty of good faith when its conduct towards a member of a collective bargaining unit is arbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith." (citing Vaca, 386 U.S. at 190, among other cases)). Thus, for Lee to prevail in her hybrid action against either the State or UPW, Lee must show both that (1) the State breached the CBA by wrongfully terminating her and (2) UPW breached its duty of fair representation by its arbitrary, discriminatory, or bad 
6

faith conduct in refusing to pursue her grievance. See Poe II,
 
105 Hawai 'i at 101-04, 94 P.3d at 656-59.3/ 
B.
 
HRS Chapter 89, entitled "Collective Bargaining in
 
Public Employment," was originally enacted in 1970. 1970 Haw.
 
Sess. Laws Act 171, at 307-22. It grants public-sector employees
 the right to engage in collective bargaining with government
 employers. HRS § 89-13 (Supp. 2010) identifies what constitutes 
prohibited practices on the part of public employers, public
 employees, and employee organizations (i.e., public employee
 unions). HRS § 89-14 (1993) provides in pertinent part, as it
 has at all times relevant to Lee's case, that the HLRB "shall
 have exclusive original jurisdiction" over any controversy
 concerning prohibited practices.
 
1. 
3 The proof required to prove a hybrid action balances the
interests of the employee to remedy a wrongful action by the
employer with the interests of the union in exercising itsdiscretion as statutory bargaining representative and a party tothe collective bargaining agreement. On the one hand, if theemployer can raise the defense of failure to exhaust contractualremedies, even where the employee is prevented from exhaustingcontractual remedies by the union's wrongful refusal to processthe grievance, the employee in this circumstance would have noremedy for an employer's wrongful discharge in violation of thecollective bargaining agreement. "To leave the employeeremediless in such circumstance would . . . be a greatinjustice." Poe II, 105 Hawai
'i at 102, 94 P.3d at 657 (ellipsis
points omitted) (quoting Vaca, 386 U.S. at 185-86). On the other hand, 
[i]f the individual employee could compel arbitration
of his [or her] grievance regardless of its merit, the
settlement machinery provided by the [collective
bargaining agreement] would be substantially
undermined, thus destroying the employer's confidence
in the union's authority and returning the individual
grievant to the vagaries of independent and
unsystematic negotiation.
 
Id. at 101, 94 P.3d at 656 (quoting Vaca, 386 U.S. at 191-92).

Prior to 1982, HRS Chapter 89 did not have a specific
 
4/
provision granting the HLRB,  exclusive original jurisdiction
over controversies concerning prohibited practices. In 1981, the
 Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) in Winslow v. State, 2 Haw.
 App. 50, 56-57, 625 P.2d 1046, 1051-52 (1981), held that the HLRB
 and the circuit courts shared concurrent jurisdiction over
 prohibited practice complaints under the versions of HRS § 89-14
 and HRS § 377-9 then in effect.
5/
 
This court's decision in Winslow prompted the Hawai 'i 
Legislature in 1982 to amend "HRS § 89-14 to legislatively
 overrule Winslow because [the Legislature] disagreed with the
 ICA's interpretation of HRS § 89-14 and HRS § 377-9."

use "HLRB" to refer to both the HLRB and its predecessor, the

court construed in Winslow and quoted in the opinion provided as

HRS § 89-14 Prevention of prohibited practices.

HLRB with "exclusive original jurisdiction" over controversies
 concerning prohibited practices by enacting Act 27, 1982 Haw.
 Sess. Laws Act 27, at 38 (Act 27). Act 27 amended HRS § 89-14 to
 read as follows (with the new material added by the amendment
 underscored):
 
"§89-14 Prevention of prohibited practices.  Any

See 1982 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 27, at 38.6/
 
The committee reports accompanying Act 27 leave no
 
doubt that the Legislature's purpose in enacting Act 27 was to
 
overrule Winslow and to make it clear that the circuit courts did
 not have concurrent jurisdiction to hear matters relating to
 public-sector prohibited practices, but that exclusive original
 jurisdiction over such matters was vested in the HLRB. See H.

prohibited practices complaint by appealing the HLRB's decision
 
to the circuit court. 
C.
 
We conclude that Lee's hybrid-action complaint involves 
a controversy concerning prohibited practices over which the HLRB
 has exclusive original jurisdiction pursuant to HRS § 89-14. 
HRS § 89-13 defines various actions which constitute a prohibited
 practice, including a public employer's willful violation of the
 terms of a collective bargaining agreement (HRS § 89-13(a)(8))
 and an public employee union's willful refusal or failure to 
comply with any provision of HRS Chapter 89 (HRS § 89­13(b)(4)).
11/
 
Lee's complaint alleged that the State had breached the
 
CBA and its duty of good faith and fair dealing and that UPW, as
 Lee's exclusive representative under the CBA, had breached its
 duty of fair representation. Lee also alleged malicious conduct
 on the part of "the Defendant." 
We conclude that Lee's complaint alleged a prohibited
 
practice against the State pursuant to HRS § 89-13(a)(8). Lee
 
11 HRS § 89-13 provides, in relevant part:
 
(a) It shall be a prohibited practice for a public
employer or its designated representative wilfully to:
 
. . . .
 
(8) Violate the terms of a collective bargaining
agreement[.]
 
. . . .
 
(b) It shall be a prohibited practice for a public
employee or for an employee organization or its
designated agent wilfully to:
 
. . . .
 
(4) Refuse or fail to comply with any provision
of this chapter[.] 
11
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
does not dispute this proposition. We conclude that Lee's 
complaint against UPW for breach of its duty of fair representation also alleged a prohibited practice. As the exclusive bargaining representative for Lee's bargaining unit, UPW had an obligation pursuant to HRS § 89-8(a) (1993) to represent the interests of all employees in the bargaining unit. HRS § 89-8(a) provides that the union, as exclusive representative, "shall have the right to act for and negotiate agreements covering all employees in the unit and shall be responsible for representing the interests of all such employees without discrimination and without regard to employee organization membership." (Emphasis added). We agree with UPW that the breach of its duty of fair representation would violate HRS § 89-8(a) and would constitute a prohibited practice under HRS § 89-13(b)(4). Accordingly, Lee's complaint against the State for breach of the CBA and against UPW for breach of its duty of fair representation presents a controversy concerning a prohibited practice over which the HLRB has exclusive original jurisdiction. See HGEA, 124 Hawai
'i at 206, 239 P.3d at 10 
(stating that "[a]lthough [the] complaint does not expressly use the words 'prohibited practice,' a prohibited practice can be logically inferred therefrom"). 
1. 
We view the Hawai
'i Supreme Court's decision in Lepere 
v. United Public Workers, Local 646, AFL-CIO, 77 Hawai 'i 471, 887 
P.2d 1029 (1995), as providing controlling authority that pursuant to HRS § 89-14, the Circuit Court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over Lee's complaint against UPW for breach of its duty of fair representation. In its published opinion, the supreme court noted that Lepere, a public employee, had filed a complaint against his union in circuit court which stemmed from the union's "refusal to submit Lepere's grievance (against his employer) to arbitration." Id. at 472, 887 P.2d at 1030. The 
supreme court explained the procedural history of the case on appeal and summarized its holding as follows: 
12
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
On appeal, the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA)
affirmed the circuit court's order dismissing Lepere's
complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Lepere
v. United Public Workers, Local 646, AFL-CIO, ---Haw. ----,849 P.2d 82 (App. 1993) (mem.). In addition, the ICAaffirmed the circuit court's order granting in part anddenying in part [the union's] motion for HRCP [(Hawai' i 
Rules of Civil Procedure)] Rule 11 sanctions. Id. Lepere
petitioned this court for a writ of certiorari, which wegranted on May 4, 1993. 
Because we believe that the ICA properly concluded
that the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to
entertain Lepere's complaint, we affirm the ICA's holding on
the motion to dismiss. However, for the reasons set forth
below, we reverse in part the ICA's holding with respect to
the HRCP Rule 11 sanctions and the circuit court's
 calculation of attorney's fees.
 
Id. (emphasis added). Moreover, in its analysis of the HRCP
 
Rule 11 sanctions, the supreme court noted that "[a]though [HRS]
 
§ 89-14 clearly precluded Lepere from bringing his prohibited
 practices complaint in the circuit court, Lepere adamantly
 pursued his claim." Id. at 474, 887 P.2d at 1032.
 
The supreme court's description of Lepere's complaint
 
as stemming from the union's "refusal to submit Lepere's
 grievance (against his employer) to arbitration" indicates that
 the complaint asserted a claim against the union for breach of
 its duty of fair representation. The supreme court's reference
 to HRS § 89-14 as clearly precluding Lepere's complaint in
 circuit court also indicates that the supreme court viewed the
 HLRB as the appropriate forum for Lepere's complaint. 
This court's unpublished memorandum opinion makes these
 
propositions clear. This court stated that Lepere's complaint
 "alleges only a breach of a duty of fair representation." Lepere
 
v. United Public Workers, Local 646, AFL-CIO, No. 15795, slip op. at 6 (Hawai
'i App. Mar. 24, 1993) (mem.) (hereinafter, "ICA 
Memorandum Opinion"). The ICA Memorandum Opinion further states that (1) the circuit court granted the union's motion to dismiss, which argued that "since the dispute pertained to an alleged breach of the duty of fair representation, [HRS] § 89-14 (1992) gave primary and exclusive jurisdiction of the dispute to the [HLRB]"; and (2) "[i]n 1982, HRS § 89-14 was amended to make it 
13
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
clear that the HLRB 'shall have exclusive original jurisdiction'"
 
over a controversy involving allegations of a breach of a duty of
 fair representation. Id. at 4, 7. Accordingly, in affirming
 
this court's decision, the supreme court necessarily held that
 the circuit court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over
 Lepere's claim that the union had beached its duty of fair
 representation, which should have been brought before the HLRB.
 
Lee argues that the supreme court's decision in Lepere 
is not controlling because the supreme court did not decide the jurisdictional issue, but only decided the propriety of HRCP Rule 11 sanctions and the award of attorney's fees. We disagree. In its published opinion, the supreme court agreed with this court's conclusion that the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Lepere's complaint. Lepere, 77 Hawai
'i at 472, 
887 P.2d at 1030. The supreme court specifically stated, "we . . . affirm the ICA's holding that affirmed the circuit court's order granting [the union's] motion to dismiss[.]" Id. at 475, 
887 P.2d at 1033. Thus, the supreme court did decide the jurisdictional question, albeit without extended discussion. We are bound by the supreme court's decision. 
We also reject Lee's suggestion that because the ICA
 
Memorandum Opinion was issued at a time when such decisions were
 not citable, we cannot tell whether the supreme court's decision
 in Lepere is applicable to Lee's case. As noted, the supreme
 court's opinion indicated that the claim Lepere asserted was for
 breach of the union's duty of fair representation and that the
 HLRB, and not the circuit court, was the appropriate forum for
 Lepere's complaint based on HRS § 89-14. In any event, we have
 not attempted to cite the ICA Memorandum Opinion as precedent or
 for persuasive value, but have only referred to the ICA
 Memorandum Opinion to clarify what the supreme court meant in its
 published decision when it affirmed the ICA's jurisdictional
 holding.

Federal courts have construed provisions similar to HRS
 
§ 89-8(a), which establish a union as the exclusive bargaining
 
representative of all employees in a bargaining unit, as imposing
 a statutory duty of fair representation. See Vaca, 386 U.S. at
 
176-78. We also note that the HLRB has concluded that a union's
 breach of its duty of fair representation violates its
 responsibilities under HRS § 89-8(a) and constitutes a prohibited
 practice subject to the HLRB's jurisdiction. See, e.g., In the
 
Matter of Lewis W. Poe, No. CU-03-214, 2004 WL 5656310, at *7
 (Haw. Labor Relations Bd. Feb. 19, 2004) ("The union's breach of
 its duty of fair representation is a prohibited practice in
 violation of HRS § 89-13(b)(4) and HRS § 89-8(a), when the
 union's conduct is arbitrary, discriminatory or in bad faith."); 
In the Matter of Keith J. Kohl, Nos. CE-13-385 & CU-13-140, 2002
 WL 34404632, at *6 (Haw. Labor Relations Bd. Mar. 8, 2002)
 (same). These decisions by the federal courts and the HLRB
 reinforce our view that Lee's complaint against the UPW for
 breach of its duty of fair representation alleged a prohibited
 practice that was within the exclusive original jurisdiction of
 the HLRB.
 
Because the allegations in Lee's complaint regarding 
(1) the State's breach of the CBA and (2) UPW's breach of its
 duty of fair representation both involve a "controversy
 concerning prohibited practices," we conclude that Lee's public-
sector hybrid action is governed by HRS § 89-14. Under HRS § 89­14, the HLRB has exclusive original jurisdiction over Lee's
 hybrid action, and the Circuit Court properly dismissed Lee's
 complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. 
D.
 
Lee relies on the United States Supreme Court decision
 
in Vaca v. Sipes, 386 U.S. 171, in arguing that the Circuit Court
 has original jurisdiction over her hybrid action. Lee's reliance
 on Vaca is misplaced. 
As explained in greater detail below, Vaca is plainly
 
distinguishable from and inapposite to Lee's case. Most
 
15
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
significantly, Vaca involved a lawsuit brought pursuant to
 
federal labor laws by a private-sector employee against his union
 for breach of the union's duty of fair representation. In
 contrast, Lee was a public-sector employee. The federal labor
 laws under which Vaca was decided do not apply to public-sector
 employers, employees, and unions, such as the State, Lee, and
 UPW. In addition, the rationales cited by the Supreme Court in
 support of its jurisdictional decision do not apply to Lee's
 hybrid action. Therefore, Vaca does not support Lee's
 jurisdictional claim. 
In Vaca, the plaintiff was discharged by his private
 
employer on the ground that his poor health rendered him unfit to
 perform his job. Id. at 175. Although the plaintiff's union
 
filed a grievance against the plaintiff's employer on his behalf,
 the union eventually declined to pursue the grievance to
 arbitration, citing insufficient medical evidence. Id. With his
 
contractual remedies stalled, the plaintiff brought suit in state
 court against the union. Id. at 173. The complaint alleged that
 
the plaintiff had been wrongfully discharged by his employer in
 violation of the collective bargaining agreement and that the
 union had breached its duty of fair representation in failing to
 pursue his grievance to arbitration. Id. 
The union argued that the state court did not have
 
jurisdiction over the plaintiff's complaint because the complaint
 essentially alleged an unfair labor practice under the National
 Labor Relations Act (N.L.R.A.) that was within the exclusive
 jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). Id.
 
The Supreme Court held that although the state court had
 jurisdiction over the plaintiff's complaint, federal labor law
 governed, and the governing federal standards had not been
 applied. Id. 
With respect to the jurisdictional issue, the Supreme
 
Court discussed several reasons for its conclusion that the NLRB
 did not have exclusive jurisdiction over claims for breach of the
 union's duty of fair representation. Id. at 179-88. Among other
 
16
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
things, the Court noted that suits alleging the breach of such
 
duty "remained judicially cognizable long after the NLRB was
 given unfair labor practice jurisdiction over union activities by
 the L.M.R.A." and that "it can be doubted whether" the NLRB would
 have substantially greater expertise than the courts in deciding
 fair representation duty claims. Id. at 181. Given these and
 
other considerations, the Court determined that it could not
 fairly be inferred that Congress intended to oust the courts of
 jurisdiction over fair representation duty claims and give
 exclusive jurisdiction to the NLRB. Id. at 179-83. 
In addition, the Court noted that the L.M.R.A
 
authorizes an employee to directly file an action in court
 against his or her employer for breach of a collective bargaining
 agreement, regardless of whether such breach was also an unfair
 labor practice within the jurisdiction of the NLRB. Id. at 183­
84. The question of whether a union has breached its duty of
 
fair representation will often be a critical issue in such a 
suit by an employee against his or her employer. Id. at 183. As
 
a result, the courts will already be compelled to determine
 whether the union has breached its duty of fair representation in
 the context of many suits brought by employees charging their
 employer with breach of the collective bargaining agreement. Id.
 
at 187.
 
As noted, there are significant differences between
 
Vaca and Lee's case which render Vaca inapposite. Vaca involved
 
a lawsuit by a private-sector employee against his private-sector
 union, and the Supreme Court relied upon the federal N.L.R.A. and
 L.M.R.A. in concluding that the NLRB did not have exclusive
 jurisdiction over the private employee's lawsuit. However, the
 N.L.R.A. and the L.M.R.A. specifically exempt public-sector
 employers as well as public-sector employees and their unions
 from the scope of their coverage. See 29 U.S.C. §§ 142, 152;
 
Ayres v. Int'l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, 666 F.2d 441, 442-44 (9th
 
17
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Cir. 1982).12/  Thus, the federal labor laws which governed the
 
Supreme Court's jurisdictional decision in Vaca, do not apply to
 
Lee's public-sector hybrid action. 
This point is clearly made by the federal Ninth Circuit
 
Court of Appeals decision in Ayers, which was rendered after
 Vaca. In Ayers, a public employee filed a hybrid action in
 federal court against his employer, a political subdivision of
 the State of Washington, and his union under section 301(a) of
 the L.M.R.A., 29 U.S.C. § 185(a). Ayers, 666 F.2d at 441. The
 
Ninth Circuit affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the action
 for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Id. at 441-42. The
 
Ninth Circuit held that states and their political subdivisions
 are not employers for purposes of section 301(a) of the L.M.R.A.
 and that section 301(a) "does not grant this court jurisdiction
 over the claims of an individual employed by a political
 subdivision of a state." Id. at 441-42, 444. 
In addition, rationales cited by the Supreme Court in
 
support of its decision in Vaca do not apply to Lee's public-
sector hybrid action. In Vaca, the Court concluded that it could
 not fairly infer that Congress intended to oust the courts of
 jurisdiction over fair representation duty claims in favor of
 
12 The N.L.R.A. and the L.M.R.A. exclude the United States
 
as well as states and their political subdivisions from its
definition of "employer." Under the N.L.R.A., "[t]he term
'employer' includes any person acting as an agent of an employer,
directly or indirectly, but shall not include the United States .
. . or any State or political subdivision thereof . . . ." 29
 U.S.C. § 152(2). In addition, the term "employee" is defined so
that it does "not include . . . any individual employed . . . by
any other person who is not an employer as herein defined," 29
 U.S.C. § 152(3), and the term "labor organization" is defined, in
part, as "any organization . . . in which employees participate
and which exists for the purpose . . . of dealing with employers
concerning grievances, labor disputes, wages, rates of pay, hours
of employment, or conditions of work." 29 U.S.C. § 152(5)
(emphases added). These definitions, which also apply to the
L.M.R.A. as a whole, see 29 U.S.C. § 142(3), establish that the
N.L.R.A. and the L.M.R.A. do not apply to State of Hawai
'i 
public-sector employers, employees, or unions. 
18

exclusive jurisdiction by the NLRB. Here, there is no 
uncertainty over the Hawai 'i Legislature's intent. In amending 
HRS § 89-14 by enacting Act 27 in 1982, the Legislature clearly expressed its intent to give the HLRB exclusive original jurisdiction over controversies concerning public-sector prohibited practices such as Lee's hybrid action. Moreover, whereas the L.M.R.A. authorizes a private-sector employee to directly file a prohibited practice complaint in court against an employer for violating the collective bargaining agreement, HRS § 89-14 grants exclusive original jurisdiction over public-sector prohibited practice complaints to the HLRB. Thus unlike in Vaca, where the federal labor laws made restricting jurisdiction over fair representation duty claims to the NLRB impractical, there is no similar impracticality in restricting public-sector hybrid actions to the HLRB under Hawai
'i's labor laws. 
For all these reasons, we conclude that Vaca does not
 
support Lee's jurisdictional argument. 
E.
 
Lee argues that if HRS § 89-14 confers upon the HLRB
 
exclusive original jurisdiction over public-sector hybrid claims,
 then the statute violates her constitutional rights (1) to
 petition the government for redress of grievances and of access
 to the courts, (2) to due process, and (3) to equal protection. 
These arguments are without merit.
 
"We review questions of constitutional law de novo, 
under the right/wrong standard." United Public Workers, AFSCME,

(2002). "Every enactment of the [L]egislature carries a presumption of constitutionality and should be upheld by the courts unless it has been shown to be, beyond all reasonable doubt, in violation of the constitution." City and County of

1.
 
Lee does not cite any pertinent authority in support of
 
her contention that HRS § 89-14, by vesting the HLRB with
 
19
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
exclusive original jurisdiction over her hybrid action, violates
 
her First Amendment right to petition the government for redress
 of grievances and of access to the courts. The right of access
 to the courts is one aspect of the right to petition the
 government for redress. California Motor Transp. Co. v. Trucking
 
Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508, 510 (1972). The right of access to the
 courts is not absolute and unlimited. "All that is required is a
 reasonable right of access -- a reasonable opportunity to be
 heard." Ciccarelli v. Carey Canadian Mines, Ltd., 757 F.2d 548,
 
554 (3rd Cir. 1985). 
The administrative dispute resolution process set forth
 
in HRS Chapter 89 did not preclude Lee from seeking redress from
 the courts. As previously stated, Lee could appeal an
 unfavorable decision issued by the HLRB to the circuit court. 
See HRS § 89-14; HRS § 91-14. Accordingly, Lee was not deprived
 of reasonable access to the courts. A party who has the
 opportunity to present his or her case at an administrative
 hearing and then appeal the decision of the administrative agency
 to a court is not deprived of the right to petition the
 government and of access to the courts. See Rivera v. Holder,
 
666 F. Supp. 2d 82, 95 n.11 (D.D.C. 2009).
 
If Lee's First Amendment claim were valid, every
 
statute enacted by the Legislature that limits judicial review to
 appeals of decisions from administrative agencies could be found
 unconstitutional. Lee provides no support for a claim that would
 have such drastic consequences. We reject her claim that HRS 
§ 89-14 violates her right to petition the government to redress
 grievances and of access to the courts.
 
2.
 
HRS § 89-14 does not violate Lee's right to procedural 
or substantive due process. With respect to procedural due process, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court has stated: 
Due process is not a fixed concept requiring a
specific procedural course in every situation. Rather, due
process is flexible and calls for such procedural
protections as the particular situation demands. The basic
 
20
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
elements of procedural due process of law require notice and
an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a
meaningful manner.
 
State v. Adam, 97 Hawai 'i 475, 482, 40 P.3d 877, 884 (2002) 
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
It is well-recognized that a person's procedural due
 
process rights are not violated when that person may participate
 
fully in an administrative agency proceeding and then seek
 judicial review of that agency decision. See Kremer v. Chem.
 
Constr. Corp., 456 U.S. 461, 483-84 (1982). Here, HRS Chapter 89
 affords Lee the opportunity to present her hybrid action to the
 HLRB in an administrative hearing, and it grants the HLRB the
 power to conduct proceedings on complaints of prohibited
 practices, administer oaths, take testimony and receive evidence,
 and compel the attendance of witnesses and production of
 documents. See HRS § 89-5(i)(4) and (5) (Supp. 2010). In
 
addition, the decisions of the HLRB require a majority vote of
 its three members, and one member each must be representative of
 management, labor, and the public. HRS § 89-5(b) and (e) (Supp.
 2010). Finally, any person aggrieved by a decision of the HLRB
 can appeal that decision to the circuit court. See HRS § 89-14;
 
HRS § 91-14. These procedures satisfy the requirements for
 procedural due process. 
Granting the HLRB exclusive original jurisdiction over 
Lee's hybrid action also does not violate Lee's right to substantive due process. "Substantive due process has been defined as that which protects those fundamental rights and liberties which are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty." Ek v. Boggs, 102 Hawai
'i 289, 297, 75 P.3d 1180, 1188 (2003) 
(internal quotation marks, ellipsis points, and citation omitted). Lee fails to demonstrate that requiring her to present her hybrid action to the HLRB for decision before she can obtain access to the courts by means of an appeal deprives her of a fundamental right. In a substantive due process analysis, if a fundamental right is not implicated, the challenged statute is 
21
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
subject only to a rational basis test. See Doe v. Doe, 116 
Hawai'i 323, 333, 172 P.3d 1067, 1077 (2007). As discussed 
below, HRS § 89-14 passes a rational basis test. 
3.
 
We reject Lee's claim that HRS § 89-14 violates her
 
right to equal protection. HRS § 89-14's grant of exclusive
 
original jurisdiction over Lee's hybrid action to the HLRB does
 not deprive Lee of a fundamental right. In addition, Lee does
 not specifically argue that public employees are a suspect class,
 and courts have held that the distinction between private and
 public employees does not involve a suspect or quasi-suspect
 classification. See Abril v. Virginia, 145 F.3d 182, 188 (4th
 
Cir. 1998); Silva v. Universidad de Puerto Rico, 817 F. Supp.
 1000, 1007 (D.P.R. 1993); State Dep't of Human Res., Welfare Div.
 v. Fowler, 858 P.2d 375, 378 (Nev. 1993). Because no fundamental
 rights or suspect classifications are implicated, we apply the
 rational basis standard of review to Lee's equal protection
 claim. Hawaii Insurers Council v. Lingle, 120 Hawai
'i 51, 71, 
201 P.3d 564, 584 (2008). Under the rational basis standard of
 review, 
a party challenging the constitutionality of a statutory
classification on equal protection grounds has the burden of
showing, with convincing clarity [,] that the classification
is not rationally related to the statutory purpose, or that
the challenged classification does not rest upon some ground
of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the
object of the legislation, and is therefore arbitrary and
capricious.
 
Washington v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Companies, 68 Haw. 192, 199,
 
708 P.2d 129, 134 (1985) (internal quotation marks and citations
 omitted). 
Here, HRS § 89-14 clearly passes constitutional muster
 
under the rational basis test. HRS Chapter 89 was enacted for a
 legitimate governmental purpose. The Legislature declared that
 "it is the public policy of the State to promote harmonious and
 cooperative relations between government and its employees and to
 protect the public by assuring effective and orderly operations
 of government." HRS § 89-1(b) (Supp. 2010). To effectuate this
 
22
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
policy, the Legislature created the HLRB to administer the
 
provisions of HRS Chapters 89. It also provided that the HLRB
 shall administer the provisions of HRS Chapter 377, relating to
 private sector collective bargaining. See HRS § 377-2 (1983). 
The Legislature's clear purpose in creating the HLRB was to
 establish a board with specialized expertise over collective
 bargaining matters. 
Granting the HLRB exclusive original jurisdiction over
 
public-sector prohibited practice controversies is rationally
 related to the public policy of HRS Chapter 89. The Legislature
 could reasonably have believed that it would be more effective in
 promoting harmonious governmental employer-employee relations and
 in assuring the effective operation of government for these
 controversies to be decided in the first instance by the HLRB
 rather than by the courts. In the context of collective
 bargaining, there are fundamental distinctions between the
 private and public sectors. See Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431
 
U.S. 209, 227-29 (1977). In light of these distinctions, the
 Legislature could rationally have decided that the HLRB's
 original jurisdiction should be exclusive for public-sector
 prohibited practice controversies but should only be concurrent
 for private-sector unfair labor practices controversies. Lee has
 not demonstrated, and we cannot say, that the Legislature was
 arbitrary and capricious in conferring the HLRB with more
 comprehensive original jurisdiction over public-sector than
 private-sector labor controversies. See Washington, 68 Haw. at
 
199, 708 P.2d at 134 ("Equal protection does not mandate that all
 laws apply with universality to all persons[.]" (internal
 quotation marks, brackets, and citation omitted)); cf. City of
 New York v. De Lury, 243 N.E.2d 128, 133-34 (N.Y. 1968) (holding
 that "legislative differentiation between public and private
 employees, insofar as restrictions on their right to strike and
 to jury trials are concerned, is reasonable[]" and does not
 violate equal protection). 
II. 
23
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Lee argues that the Circuit Court erred in reducing the 
award of attorneys' fees to half the requested amount. We review 
the Circuit Court's award of attorneys' fees for abuse of discretion. Kamaka v. Goodsill Anderson Quinn & Stifel, 117 
Hawai
'i 92, 105, 176 P.3d 91, 104 (2008). We conclude that the 
Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in limiting the amount of attorney's fees awarded to Lee. 
The Circuit Court granted UPW's motion to set aside the
 
entry of default against UPW "on the condition that UPW pay
 necessary and reasonable fees and costs to [Lee] for the time
 [Lee] spent to prepare for and attend her motion for entry of
 default judgment as against UPW." The record indicates that
 Lee's counsel expended 7.4 hours (valued at $1,480) in connection
 with the motion for entry of default judgment that Lee filed
 against both the State and UPW. Lee argues that "[t]he same
 services were expended and incurred in preparing, filing, and
 appearing at the hearing [on the motion][,]" that the same proof
 was required against both UPW and the State, and that the State
 was mentioned "at most[] five times" in the pleading. 
However, Lee's motion for entry of default judgment was
 
filed against both UPW and the State. Lee stipulated with the
 State that the entry of default against the State would be set
 aside without requiring the State to pay any attorney's fees.
 Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the Circuit Court
 abused its discretion in limiting its award of attorney's fees
 against UPW and in favor of Lee to $740, an amount reflecting
 one-half of the time that Lee's attorney spent on the motion for
 entry of default judgment that Lee filed against both the State
 and UPW.
 
CONCLUSION
 
We hold that the Circuit Court properly dismissed Lee's
 
complaint against UPW and the State for lack of jurisdiction. We
 therefore affirm the Circuit Court's January 24, 2007, Judgment. 
We also hold that the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion
 in limiting its award of attorney's fees against UPW to $740. We
 
24
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
therefore affirm (1) the Circuit Court's November 15, 2006, order
 
awarding Lee attorney's fees and costs against UPW; and (2) its
 January 17, 2007, order denying Lee's motion to alter, amend, or
 revise the award of attorneys' fees.
