STATE OF HAWAI» I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
ZACHARY KANAKANUI, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 97-157) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Fujise, and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
In this post-conviction proceeding, Defendant Appellant
 
Zachary Kanakanui (Kanakanui) appeals from the "Order Denying
 
Defendant's Motion to Reconsider Sentence" (Order), which was
 filed on February 26, 2007, in the Circuit Court of the Third
 Circuit (circuit court).
1/ We vacate the Order and Kanakanui's
 
extended term sentences, and we remand the case for resentencing.
 
I. 
In 1997, Kanakanui was found guilty after a jury trial 
of first degree burglary and second degree theft. 
Prior to 
sentencing, Plaintiff Appellee State of Hawai» i (State) filed the 
"State's Motion to Impose Mandatory Minimum, Consecutive, and Extended Terms of Imprisonment." The State argued that Kanakanui 
qualified for extended terms of imprisonment as a "persistent 
offender," a "professional criminal," and a "multiple offender," pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ÿÿÿÿ 706-662(1), 706-662(2), and 706-662(4) (Supp. 1996), respectively. In support of its motion for extended terms of imprisonment, the State submitted evidence of Kanakanui's prior convictions, which included felony convictions for first degree burglary, 
1/ The Honorable Glen S. Hara presided over the post-conviction
proceeding.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
unauthorized control of a propelled vehicle, and second degree
 
theft. Kanakanui's criminal record also reflected that Kanakanui
 had been sentenced to terms of imprisonment after repeatedly
 violating conditions of his probation and that he had numerous
 misdemeanor convictions.
 
The circuit court
2/ sentenced Kanakaui on December 19,
 
1997. The circuit court granted the State's motion for extended
 terms of imprisonment based on its finding that Kanakanui was a
 persistent offender and a multiple offender and that extended
 terms were necessary for the protection of the public. The
 circuit court sentenced Kanakanui to extended terms of twenty
 years of imprisonment for the first degree burglary conviction
 and ten years of imprisonment for the second degree theft
 
conviction. The circuit court imposed these sentences to run
 concurrent with each other but consecutive to Kanakanui's
 
sentence in a prior case. 
Kanakanui filed a direct appeal from his judgment of 
conviction and sentence. 
On January 21, 1999, the Hawai» i 
Supreme Court affirmed Kanakanui's judgment in Appeal No. 21274. Kanakanui's conviction and sentence became final in 1999. 
On July 28, 2006, Kanakanui filed a "Motion to 
Reconsider Sentence," pursuant to Hawai» i Rules of Penal 
Procedure (HRPP) Rule 35 (2003). On February 6, 2007, Kanakanui filed the "Defendant's Supplement to Defendant's Motion to Reconsider Sentence, Filed on July 28, 2006 and Defendant's Motion to Correct Sentence." Kanakanui asserted that he was sentenced to extended terms of imprisonment based on his refusal 
to admit guilt, in violation of his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself, and that his extended term sentences were illegal under Apprendi v. New Jersey , 530 U.S. 466 (2000). On 
February 26, 2007, the circuit court issued its Order, and Kanakanui appealed. 
2/  The Honorable Riki May Amano presided over Kanakanui's sentencing.

II.
 
In this appeal, Kanakanui argues that his extended 
terms of imprisonment must be vacated because the circuit court 
imposed them due to his refusal to admit guilt, in violation of his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination under the United States and Hawai» i Constitutions. Kanakanui cites State 
v. Kamana» o, 103 Hawai» i 315, 82 P.3d 401 (2003), in support of 
this argument. Kanakanui also asserts that his extended terms of imprisonment must be vacated because 1) they were illegal under Apprendi  and its progeny; and 2) the sentencing court failed to 
make sufficient findings of fact or conclusions of law to support the imposition of the extended sentences. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, we resolve Kanakanui's points of error
 
as follows:
 
1. In Kamana» o, the defendant, Andrew Kamana» o, filed 
a motion collaterally attacking his extended terms of imprisonment approximately fifteen years after his convictions and sentences had become final. Kamana» o, 103 Hawai» i at 315-19, 
82 P.3d at 401-05. The Hawai» i Supreme Court held that the trial 
court had violated Kamana» o's constitutional privilege against 
self-incrimination by imposing extended terms of imprisonment based on Kamana» o's refusal to admit his guilt regarding the 
convictions on which he was being sentenced and which he intended to appeal. Kamana» o, 103 Hawai» i at 316, 82 P.3d at 402. The 
supreme court vacated the trial court's judgment of sentence against Kamana» o and remanded the case for resentencing. Id. 
We conclude that the analysis in Kamana» o controls our 
decision in this case. Based on our review of the record, we 
conclude that Kanakanui's refusal to admit guilt "improperly influenced" the sentencing court's decision to impose extended terms of imprisonment. See id. at 323, 82 P.3d at 409 (internal 
quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, we 1) vacate the circuit court's February 26, 2007, Order; 2) vacate the portion of the 
circuit court's judgment filed on December 24, 1997, that imposed 
3
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
extended terms of imprisonment on Kanakanui; and 3) remand the 
case to the circuit court for resentencing. Upon remand, the circuit court may again impose extended terms of imprisonment in accordance with Act 1 of the 2007 Second Special Session of the Hawai» i Legislature, 2007 Haw. Sess. L., 2d Spec. Sess., Act 1 
(codified at HRS ÿÿÿÿ 706-661, 706-662, and 706-664 (Supp. 2009)). See State v. Jess, 117 Hawai» i 381, 389, 413-15, 184 P.3d 133, 
141, 165-67 (2008). Kanakanui is entitled to have a jury empaneled to find the facts necessary for the imposition of any extended term sentence. 2007 Haw. Sess. L., 2d Spec. Sess., Act 1; Jess, 117 Hawai» i at 389, 413-15, 184 P.3d at 141, 165-67. 
2. In light of our preceding analysis, we need not
 
address Kanakanui's other points of error.
 
III.
 
For the foregoing reasons, we 1) vacate the circuit
 
court's February 26, 2007, Order; 2) vacate the portion of the
 
circuit court's judgment filed on December 24, 1997, that imposed
 extended terms of imprisonment on Kanakanui; and 3) remand the
 case to the circuit court for resentencing.
