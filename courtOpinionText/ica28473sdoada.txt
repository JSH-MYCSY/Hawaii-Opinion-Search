APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

 
(CIVIL NO. 05-1-0274)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Michele R. Steigman (
Steigman)
 
appeals from the March 6, 2007 Final Judgment (Final Judgment)
 
entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court)
 
in favor of Defendant-Appellee Outrigger Enterprises, Inc., doing
 
business as Ohana Surf Hotel (Outrigger).1
 
This appeal arises from a jury trial wherein the jury 
rejected Steigman's negligence claim against Outrigger. On 
appeal, Steigman contends that the Circuit Court erred by: (1) 
denying her Hawai 'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 50 
Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law and HRCP Rule 50 Motion 
for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict, or in the alternative, 
1
 The Honorable Victoria S. Marks presided.

 for New Trial; (2) instructing the jury that a hotel operator
may not, under certain circumstances, be liable for physical harm 
caused by known or obvious dangers; (3) failing to strike 
references to non-admissible evidence; and (4) failing to strike 
Outrigger's expert testimony for, 
inter alia, violation of the 
Hawai'i Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 615 witness exclusionary 
rule. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs

 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Steigman's points of error as follows:
 
(1) Steigman argues that the Circuit Court erred in
 
denying her Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law and Motion for
 
a New Trial because "the only reasonable conclusion was that
 
Outrigger was negligent." We disagree.
 
An occupier of land, such as a hotel operator, has a
 
duty to use reasonable care for the safety of all persons
 
reasonably anticipated to be upon the premises, including hotel
 
guests. Bidar v. Amfac, Inc., 66 Haw. 547, 552, 669 P.2d 154,
 
159 (1983). This duty is to take reasonable steps to eliminate,
 or adequately warn users against, conditions posing an
 
unreasonable risk of harm if the possessor of land knows or
 
should have known of the unreasonable risk. Corbett v. Ass'n of
 
Apartment Owners of Wailua Bayview Apartments, 70 Haw. 415, 417,
 772 P.2d 693, 695 (1989). Liability cannot be imposed when the
 
possessor of land has not been put on actual or constructive
 
notice of the unsafe condition or defect that allegedly causes
 
2
 Since 1993, HRCP Rule 50 has referred to "motions for judgment
notwithstanding the verdict" as "renewed motions for judgment as a matter of
law." See Nelson v. University of Hawai' i, 97 Hawai' i 376, 392 n.14, 38 P.3d
95, 112 n.14 (2001) (citing HRCP Rule 50). As this amendment was not intended to result in a substantive change of law, see id., we shall hereafter refer toSteigman's "motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict" under the correctterminology.

3plaintiff's injury.  Harris v. State, 1 Haw. App. 554, 557, 623
P.2d 446, 448 (1981).
The duty of care owed by a private possessor of land,
such as Outrigger, does not require or include "the elimination
of known or obvious hazards which are not extremes and which [the
person claiming injury] would reasonably be expected to avoid." 
Id. (citation omitted); see also Kole v. AMFAC, Inc., 69 Haw.
530, 532, 750 P.2d 929, 930 (1988).  
While the existence of a duty is a question of law,
McKenzie v. Hawaii Permanente Med. Group, Inc., 98 Hawai #i 296,
298, 47 P.3d 1209, 1211 (2002), the discreet determination of
whether a condition is, in fact, known or obvious is generally a
question for the trier of fact.  See Gelber v. Sheraton-Hawaii
Corp., 49 Haw. 327, 330-331, 417 P.2d 638, 640 (1966)
(instruction permitting jury to find that condition in hotel was
obvious permissible if obviousness sufficiently supported by
record evidence); cf. Tabieros v. Clark Equipment Co., 85 Hawai# i
336, 364, 944 P.2d 1279, 1307 (1997) (in product liability suit,
citing case law for proposition that "[a]lthough the question of
whether a duty exists is one of law, the question of whether a
risk is obvious or generally known is one of fact and thus should
be decided by the trier of fact when reasonable minds may
differ."); Maguire v. Hilton Hotels Corp., 79 Hawai #i 110, 116-
17, 899 P.2d 393, 399-400 (1995) (in negligence suit against
hotel, concluding that existence of duty turned on reasonable
forseeability of injury which is a question of fact unless
reasonable minds cannot differ).
Based on Steigman's own testimony, she stepped barefoot
and wet onto a lanai that was exposed to wind and rain
immediately after, and possibly during, a heavy rainstorm without
looking at the lanai's smooth concrete floor.  Prior to
Steigman's accident, there were no reported incidents of guests
falling on wet lanai surfaces, although it was known that theNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
lanais could become slippery when wet. In addition, Steigman's
 
expert witness testified that the co-efficient of friction of the
 
lanai's surface when wet was below the minimum co-efficient of
 
friction for a safe walking surface. While there is conflicting
 
evidence in the record, we cannot conclude that there can be but
 
one reasonable conclusion as to the proper judgment. 
Accordingly, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not err in
 
denying Steigman's motion for judgment as a matter of law and did
 
not abuse its discretion in denying Steigman's motion for a new
 
trial.
 
(2) Steigman argues that the Circuit Court erred by 
giving the "known or obvious" jury instruction because that 
instruction conflicts with the Hawai 'i comparative negligence 
statute, originally enacted in 1969 and now codified at Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 663-31 (1993). The jury instruction and 
HRS § 663-31 respectively provide that: 
A hotel operator is not liable to its guests for
physical harm caused to them by any activity or condition in
the hotel whose danger is known or obvious to them, unless
the hotel operator should anticipate the harm despite such
knowledge or obviousness.
 
The word "known" denotes not only knowledge of the
existence of the condition or activity itself, but also
appreciation of the danger it involves. Thus the condition
 or activity must not only be known to exist, but it must
also be recognized that it is dangerous, and the probability
and gravity of the threatened harm must be appreciated.
"Obvious" means that both the condition and the risk are
 apparent to and would be recognized by a reasonable man, in
the position of the guest, exercising ordinary perception,
intelligence, and judgment.
 
§ 663-31. Contributory negligence no bar; comparative
negligence; findings of fact and special verdicts
. (a)
Contributory negligence shall not bar recovery in any action
by any person . . . for negligence resulting in . . . injury
to person or property, if such negligence was not greater
than the negligence of the person...against whom recovery is
sought, but any damages allowed shall be diminished in
 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the
person for whose injury, damage or death recovery is made.3
 
Steigman claims that, contrary to the challenged
 
instruction, a known or obvious danger should, if anything,
 
merely increase her comparative percentage of fault under HRS
 
§ 663-31 rather than completely bar her negligence action.4 We
 
disagree.
 
Hawai'i appellate courts have implicitly rejected 
Steigman's contention by consistently articulating and applying 
the known or obvious doctrine after the enactment of the 
comparative negligence statute in both published and unpublished 
premises liability decisions. See generally Harris, 1 Haw. App. 
at 557, 623 P.2d at 448 (in 1981, stating that "the duty of care which the State, as an occupier of the premises owed to the 
appellant does not require the elimination of known or obvious 
hazards which are not extremes and which appellant would 
reasonably be expected to avoid"); Kole, 69 Haw. at 532, 750 P.2d 
at 930 (in 1988, citing case law for proposition that "occupier 
of land has duty to warn persons coming on to land of known 
dangers not known by nor obvious to the latter"). 
3
 This Court has previously summarized the legal effect of HRS
§ 663-31:
 
Hawai'i's modified comparative negligence statute, HRS
§ 663-31, bars a plaintiff's recovery only if the
plaintiff's negligence is greater than the negligence of alldefendants involved. If recovery is not barred, HRS § 663-31then reduces the plaintiff's recovery against the defendantor defendants by the proportion of fault of the negligentplaintiff. The purpose of this statute is to allow one partyat fault in an accident resulting in injury to berecompensed for the damages attributable to the fault ofanother if the former's negligence was not the primary causeof the accident. 
Rapoza v. Parnell, 83 Hawai' i 78, 82, 924 P.2d 572, 576 (App. 1996) (internal
quotation marks and citation omitted). 
4
 There is no dispute that the subject jury instruction accurately
conveys the "known or obvious" doctrine under Hawai' i law. Rather, Steigman
raises the discreet argument that the "known or obvious" doctrine is
inherently incompatible with principles of comparative negligence. 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Moreover, there is no inherent conflict between the
 
known or obvious doctrine and the comparative negligence statute. 
HRS § 663-31 provides that "[c]ontributory negligence shall not
 
bar recovery in any action . . . if such negligence was not
 
greater than the negligence of the person . . . against whom
 
recovery is sought." Thus, the comparative negligence analysis,
 
is applied only if the defendant is found to have been negligent. 
The known or obvious doctrine is determinative of the
 
threshold issue of defendant's negligence, and more specifically,
 
whether the defendant possessor of land owes a legal duty to the
 
injured party. See Harris, 1 Haw. App. at 557, 623 P.2d at 448
 
("the duty of care which the State, as an occupier of the
 premises owed to the appellant does not require the elimination
 
of known or obvious hazards which are not extremes and which
 
appellant would reasonably be expected to avoid"). Therefore, if
 
the finder of fact determines that the hazard falls within the
 
known or obvious doctrine, the question of comparative negligence
 
is never reached as the defendant owes no duty to the plaintiff,
 
and accordingly, cannot be negligent as a matter of law. In the
 
absence of a legal duty owed to the plaintiff, there is no
 
negligence to compare under HRS § 663-31. Cf. Anderson v. Ruoff,
 
100 Ohio App.3d 601, 604, 654 N.E.2d 449, 451 (Ohio Ct. App.
 1995) ("The open and obvious doctrine, therefore, is not
 
inconsistent with the comparative negligence principles set forth
 
in R.C. 2315.19. Rather, the open and obvious doctrine is
 
determinative of the threshold issue, the landowner's duty.");
 
Riddle v. McLouth Steel Products Corp., 440 Mich. 85, 99, 485
 
N.W.2d 676, 683 (Mich. 1992) (rejecting argument that "open and
 
obvious danger" rule conflicted with comparative negligence and
 
citing case law for proposition that "before a plaintiff's fault
 
can be compared with that of the defendant, it obviously must
 
first be determined that the defendant was negligent."). The
 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Circuit Court did not err in giving the known or obvious jury
 
instruction.5
 
(3) Steigman argues that the Circuit Court erred in
 
failing to strike the testimony of Outrigger's expert medical
 
examiner, Dr. Joshua Prager, because Outrigger violated the
 
witness exclusion rule set forth in HRE Rule 615 by discussing
 
another witness's testimony with Dr. Prager immediately prior to
 
Dr. Prager's testimony. 
Generally, "noncompliance with a sequestration order
 
under HRE Rule 615 does not require a new trial unless the
 
court's decision to allow the allegedly tainted testimony was an
 
abuse of discretion or resulted in prejudice[.]" Elmaleh, 7 Haw.
 
App. at 493, 782 P.2d at 890 (citation and internal quotation
 
marks omitted). The "sanctions which a court chooses to attach
 
to the violation of its sequestration order is a matter within
 
the discretion of the court." Id. (citation, brackets, and
 
internal quotation marks omitted). Steigman bears the burden to
 
demonstrate that "there was either prejudice or an abuse of
 
discretion." Id. (citation and internal quotation marks
 
omitted). 
Even assuming that Outrigger violated the HRE Rule 615
 
witness exclusionary rule, Steigman has failed to meet her
 
5
 In challenging the known or obvious jury instruction, Steigman
raises two additional arguments which we similarly reject. First, Steigman
contends that this court must follow Larsen v. Pacesetter Systems, Inc., 74
Haw. 1, 35-36, 837 P.2d 1273, 1290-91 (1992) which held that, under principles
of comparative negligence, "secondary implied assumption of risk" or in other
words "where [a] plaintiff knows of the danger presented by a defendant's
negligence and proceeds voluntarily and unreasonably to encounter it," does
not automatically bar a plaintiff's recovery. Id. at 35-36, 837 P.2d at 1290­
91. We reject this contention primarily because the holding in Larsen was
expressly limited to product liability and warranty actions. Indeed, we areaware of no Hawai' i authority which has extended Larsen or the "secondary
implied assumption of risk" doctrine to the instant realm of premises 
liability. We also note that Hawai' i appellate courts have, albeit in
unpublished decisions, reaffirmed the vitality of the "known or obvious"
doctrine within the context of premises liability after both Larsen and theenactment of the comparative negligence statute. Steigman further argues thatthere was no record evidence of a known or obvious condition on the lanai, andtherefore, no factual basis to give the instruction. As noted above, therewas substantial evidence to support such a finding by the jury. 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
burden.6 Here, the Circuit Court: (1) instructed the jury that
 
Dr. Prager reviewed Dr. Ferrante's testimony prior to testifying
 
and that this fact could be considered in weighing Prager's
 
credibility; (2) permitted Steigman to cross-examine Dr. Prager
 
about his review of Dr. Ferrante's testimony; and (3) permitted
 
Steigman to reference Dr. Prager's review of Dr. Ferrante's
 
testimony in closing argument. In addition, Dr. Prager's
 
challenged testimony could not have meaningfully prejudiced
 
Steigman because Prager's challenged testimony was restricted to
 
the elements of causation and damages which the jury did not
 
reach in rendering its verdict. We conclude that the Circuit
 
Court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to strike Dr.
 
Prager's testimony in its entirety.7 See Elmaleh, 7 Haw. App. at
 
493, 782 P.2d at 890.
 
(4) Steigman argues that the Circuit Court erred by
 
failing to strike references to the content of certain documents
 related to the separation of her employment (these documents
 
include a Disciplinary Report signed by Steigman and a Separation
 
Statement unsigned by Steigman and are collectively referred to
 
as the Termination Documents). Specifically, Steigman identifies
 
6
 There is persuasive authority which suggests that expert
witnesses, such as Dr. Prager, should generally fall outside the scope of the
HRE Rule 615 witness exclusionary rule. See generally Opus 3 Ltd. v. Heritage 
Park, Inc., 91 F.3d 625, 629 (4th Cir. 1996) (under identical version of
Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) Rule 615, stating that "[b]ecause Rule 615 is
designed to preclude fact witnesses from shaping their testimony based on
other witnesses' testimony, it does not mandate the sequestration of expertwitnesses who are to give only expert opinions at trial."); U.S. v. Crabtree,979 F.2d 1261, 1270 (1992) (under FRE 615, stating that "there is little ifany difference between counsel disclosing prior testimony to an expert andhaving an expert listen to such testimony in the courtroom"); State v.Hartmann, 120 Hawai' i 49, 200 P.3d 418 (App. 2009) (unpublished SDO) (within
context of HRE Rule 615, declining to conclude that expert witness could notbase opinion on information received during trial). 
7
 Steigman also argues that, in violation of the Pretrial Order, Dr.
Prager presented opinions to the jury not disclosed in his October 6, 2006
written report or October 10, 2006 deposition. As noted above, however,
Prager's challenged testimony was confined to causation and damages which the
jury did not reach in rendering its verdict. Therefore, even assuming a
violation of the Pretrial Order, any error was harmless.

as error Stanley Owings' reading of his File Chronology on cross-
examination, Outrigger's reference to "timecard fraud" during its
 
cross-examination of Dr. Ferrante, and Outrigger's reference to
 
Owings' testimony and the content of the Termination Documents
 
during closing argument. 
Owings opined, as an expert witness, that Steigman was
 
essentially unemployable given her foot injury and lack of
 
education. Owings testified that he reviewed numerous employment
 
documents, including the Termination Documents, which Owings
 
received from Steigman's counsel. Based on his evaluation,
 
Owings drafted an assessment and attached a File Chronology which
 
summarized the written documents reviewed during his evaluation. 
On cross-examination, Outrigger requested that Owings read from a
 
portion of his File Chronology that stated that Steigman was
 
"discharged for timecard fraud, reporting hours that she did not
 
work, insubordination, not following directions given by
 
supervisor, violation of company rule, safety concerns, over use
 
of phone." The File Chronology was not admitted into evidence. 
In Hawai 'i, an expert witness, such as Owings, may base 
his or her opinion "upon matters otherwise inadmissible" in both 
criminal and civil actions. See Estate of Klink ex rel. Klink v. 
State, 113 Hawai 'i 332, 355, 152 P.3d 504, 527 (2007) (citations 
omitted); State v. Yip, 92 Hawai 'i 98, 108, 987 P.2d 996, 1006 
(App. 1999) (citing HRE Rule 703). Thus, "broad 
cross-examination of an expert is permitted, in recognition of 
the liberal bases allowed for an expert's testimony." Lai v. St. 
Peter, 10 Haw. App. 298, 315, 869 P.2d 1352, 1361 (App. 1994), 
overruled on other grounds by Richardson v. Sport Shinko (Waikiki 
Corp.), 76 Hawai 'i 494, 502 n.10, 880 P.2d 169, 177 n.10 (1994). 
This principle is set forth in HRE Rule 702.1(a) and its 
commentary. Pursuant to Rule 702.1(a), a party may generally 
cross-examine an expert on the matter upon which the expert's 
opinion is based and the reasons for the expert's opinion, even 
9  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
if the basis for the expert's opinion would ordinarily be 
inadmissable. See, e.g., In re Doe, 81 Hawai 'i 447, 452, 456-57, 
918 P.2d 254, 259, 263-64 (App. 1996); cf. Miyamoto v. Lum, 104 Hawai
'i 1, 15-16, 84 P.3d 509, 523-24 (2004). 
Owings, as part of his expert assessment, reviewed

 
various employment documents, including the Termination Documents
 
and outlined all reviewed documents in his File Chronology. 
Therefore, pursuant to HRE Rule 702.1(a), Outrigger could
 
properly cross-examine Owings regarding the content of his File
 
Chronology, which summarized the documents upon which Owings'
 
expert opinion was largely based. 
Unlike Owings, Dr. Ferrante, Steigman's expert medical
 
examiner, did not rely on the Termination Documents in rendering
 
his opinion and testified that he was unaware that Steigman had
 
been terminated. As the Termination Documents were never
 
admitted into evidence, Outrigger's reference to Steigman's
 
alleged timecard fraud during its cross-examination of Ferrante
 
was improper.8 The Circuit Court failed to strike Outrigger's
 
reference to timecard fraud or provide a curative jury
 instruction despite Steigman's requests. 
In civil cases, the extent of cross-examination "will 
not be the subject of reversal unless clearly prejudicial to the 
complaining party." Bhakta, 109 Hawai
'i at 208, 124 P.3d at 953 
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also Nature Conservancy v. Nakila, 4 Haw. App. 584, 596, 671 P.2d 1025, 1034 
(1983) (stating that "[m]atters regarding the examination of 
witnesses are within the discretion of the trial court and its 
rulings will not be subject to reversal absent prejudicial abuse 
8
 While HRE Rule 608(b) permits, under certain circumstances, cross-
examination into prior instances of conduct bearing on untruthfulness, the
rule is generally limited to: (1) cross-examination of the witness whose
credibility is being attacked; or (2) cross-examination of a witness
testifying to the character of the witness whose credibility is being
attacked. See HRE Rule 608(b). Here, Outrigger was not attempting to attack
Dr. Ferrante's credibility and Ferrante was not testifying to Steigman's
character.

of such discretion," and concluding that, even if trial court 
erred in overruling objection during cross-examination, error was 
not prejudicial) (citations omitted). We cannot conclude that 
Steigman was clearly prejudiced. First, the Circuit Court 
instructed the jury, which is presumed to follow all of the trial 
court's instructions, that counsel's statements and questions are 
not evidence. Sato v. Tawata, 79 Hawai 'i 14, 21, 897 P.2d 941, 
948 (1995) (citation omitted). Second, Dr. Ferrante's testimony was restricted to causation and damages which the jury did not 
reach in rendering its verdict – furthermore, Dr. Ferrante did 
not change his expert opinion and testified that he continued to 
believe Steigman. Third, and most importantly, Outrigger's 
reference to timecard fraud was repeated through Owing's 
testimony, properly elicited on cross-examination, that: (1) he 
received the Termination Documents from Steigman's counsel, and 
(2) the Termination Documents stated that Wilder Construction
 
terminated Steigman for, inter alia, timecard fraud. 
Steigman failed to object during closing arguments to 
Outrigger's reference to Owing's testimony and the content of the 
Termination Documents. Accordingly, this contention is waived. 
See Stewart v. Brennan, 7 Haw. App. 136, 148, 748 P.2d 816, 824 
(1988); Young v. Price, 48 Haw. 22, 29, 395 P.2d 365, 370 (1964); 
cf. Doe v. Grosvenor Center Associates, 104 Hawai

'i 32, 55-56, 919 P.2d 294, 317-18 (1996). 
For these reasons, we reject Steigman's argument that

 
the Circuit Court reversibly erred with respect to the references
 
to the Termination Documents.
