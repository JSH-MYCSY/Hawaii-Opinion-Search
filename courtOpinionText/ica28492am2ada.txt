SECOND ORDER OF CORRECTION
(By: Nakamura, J., for the court1/)
The Memorandum Opinion, filed on September 22, 2009, is
hereby corrected as follows:
On page 9, in the sixth line from the bottom of the
page, the word "not" should be inserted between the words "did"
and "know" to correct an inadvertent typographical error
regarding the omission of the word "not."  As corrected, the text
reads as follows:  "Tolentino did not know what Delos Santos was
going to do."  
The clerk of the court is directed to incorporate the
foregoing change in the original opinion and take all necessary
steps to notify the publishing agencies of this change.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
