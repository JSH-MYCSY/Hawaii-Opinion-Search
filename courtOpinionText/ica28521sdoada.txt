IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
CITIBANK (SOUTH DAKOTA), N.A., Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
DARREN KAMALU, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
KO'OLAUPOKO DIVISION
 
(CIVIL CASE NO. 1RC06-1-140)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant pro se Darren Kamalu (Kamalu)

 
appeals from the Judgment filed on March 29, 2007 in the District
 
1
Court of the First Circuit, Ko 'olaupoko Division,  (district
court). After a bench trial, the district court entered judgment 
in the amount of $
14,839.93 in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee 
Citibank (South Dakota), N.A. (Citibank) and against Kamalu pursuant to the court's February 1, 2007 "Findings of Fact; 
Conclusions of Law; Order Directing Entry of Judgment in Favor of 
[Citibank] Against [Kamalu]" (FOF/COL/Order). 
On appeal, Kamalu claims thirty points of error by the
 
district court. Most of the points allege errors in the district

court's Findings of Fact on the basis that the findings were
 
supported by inadmissible evidence (we have grouped the points of
 
error set forth below, when possible, by the evidence
 
challenged). Kamalu contends the district court erred by:
 
A. "[p]resuming jurisdiction that allowed [Citibank]
 
to violate federal laws," i.e., the Fair Debt Collection
 
Practices Act (FDCPA), 15 U.S.C. ยง 1692 et. seq.;
 
B. "allow[ing] the matter to proceed without a
 
plaintiff being represented in any manner to substantiate the
 
complaint" and "where no controversy existed" between Citibank
 
and Kamalu;
 
C. allowing the testimony of Terry Johnson, allegedly
 
a third party "with no personal knowledge";
 
D. issuing findings regarding Citibank's normal
 
business practices for mailing credit card agreements and
 
statements when no Citibank employee testified regarding the
 
practices;
 
E. issuing findings regarding the terms of the credit
 
card agreement;
 
F. issuing findings based on the credit card
 
statements because the statements were not verified under FDCPA
 
and were inadmissible evidence because the statements came from
 
CitiCorp Credit Services, Inc., not Citibank;
 
G. not deeming admitted the matters that Kamalu
 
submitted to Citibank in his Request for Admissions under
 
District Court Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 36(a);
 
H. not finding that Citibank owed Kamalu money, based
 
on presumptions mandated by the Hawaii Rules of Evidence Rule
 
303(c); and
 
I. finding that Citibank issued two credit cards to
 
Kamalu after he applied for them; Citibank owned the accounts
 
associated with the cards; Kamalu made purchases and cash
 
advances on the accounts; and Citibank loaned and/or advanced
 
monies to third parties on Kamalu's behalf.

submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude that
 
Kamalu's appeal is without merit.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment filed on 
March 29, 2007 in the District Court of the First Circuit, Ko
'olaupoko Division, is affirmed.
