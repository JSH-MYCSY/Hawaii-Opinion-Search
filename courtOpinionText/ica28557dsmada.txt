OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
JEFF JOHN SILVA, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
LAUREE R. KALEIKAU-GILL, Defendant-Appellant,
and KAAHALAMA (k), et al., Defendants
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT

 
(CIVIL NO. 06-1-0098)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL

 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
On July 9, 2010, a notice of suggestion of the death of
 
Defendant-Appellant Lauree R. Kaleikau-Gill (Appellant) was
 
filed. Upon consideration of position statements filed
 thereafter by Plaintiff-Appellee, Appellant's former attorney,
 and Defendant Geraldine Olszowka-Martinez (Kaleikau), and a
 letter from Lisa Kaleikau, this court ordered, on December 6,
 2010, that if no motion for substitution of Appellant was filed
 within 30 days from the date of the order, the court would
 dismiss the appeal. 
It appears that more than 30 days have passed and no
 
motion for substitution of Appellant has been filed, therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is dismissed.
 DATED: Honolulu, Hawaii, January 18, 2011.
