 Since the TRO has already expired, this appeal is arguably moot. 2
However, an exception to the mootness doctrine applies to this case since the
question on appeal "affect[s] the public interest" and is "capable of

NO. 28562
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(FC-DA NO. 07-1-0159)
March 31, 2010
NAKAMURA, C.J., FUJISE, AND LEONARD, JJ.
OPINION OF THE COURT BY NAKAMURA, C.J.
Petitioner-Appellant Maria Styke (Styke) appeals from
the "Order Dissolving Temporary Restraining Order for Protection" 
(Dissolution Order) that was entered by the Family Court of the
Second Circuit (family court)1 on May 3, 2007.  The Dissolution
Order dissolved a ninety-day temporary restraining order for
protection (TRO) that was entered against Respondent-Appellee
Bruce Anthony Sotelo, Jr., (Sotelo) on April 2, 2007.  The sole
issue presented in this appeal is whether the family court erred
in ruling that Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 586-5(b) (2006)
required the dissolution of the TRO because a show-cause hearing
was not held within fifteen days of the issuance of the TRO.  We
conclude that the family court erred in dissolving the TRO and
accordingly, we vacate the Dissolution Order.2  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2BACKGROUND
Styke and Sotelo lived together and were involved in a
romantic, intimate relationship.  On April 1, 2007, a physical
altercation ensued between Styke, who was pregnant, and Sotelo
(April 1, 2007, incident), which resulted in Sotelo being
arrested and charged in a separate criminal case.  Thereafter,
according to the record on appeal, Sotelo remained in custody
throughout all family court proceedings relevant to this appeal. 
I.
On April 2, 2007, Styke filed an ex parte petition for
a TRO pursuant to HRS Chapter 586 (Petition), claiming that
Sotelo had committed "acts of domestic abuse or threats of
domestic abuse against [Styke]" beginning on or about December 2,
2006, with the most recent acts occurring on April 1, 2007.  The
Petition alleged that during the April 1, 2007, incident, Sotelo:
punched Styke in the face several times; pulled her hair; yanked
her head from side to side; put a pillow over her face, stopping
her from breathing; choked her; banged her head "against the
tile"; put his knees against her stomach while he was on top of
her; yanked on her head; and shoved her head into a pile of
sheets on the floor. 
On April 2, 2007, the family court granted the Petition
and issued a ninety-day TRO against Sotelo, which was served on
Sotelo the same day.  The TRO, among other things, restrained
Sotelo from threatening or physically abusing Styke, contacting
Styke, or remaining within 100 yards of Styke's place of
residence.  The TRO had a stated expiration date of July 3, 2007,
and ordered Sotelo to appear at a hearing to show cause why the
TRO should not continue to be in effect (show-cause hearing) on
April 12, 2007, at 8:00 a.m.  However, due to rather unusual
circumstances, the family court continued the show-cause hearing
three times.FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 Judge Bissen was apparently referring to HRS § 586-5.3
3A.
At the request of Styke's attorney and with no
objection from Sotelo, the family court, the Honorable Richard T.
Bissen, Jr., (Judge Bissen) presiding, continued the April 12,
2007, hearing until April 19, 2007, because Styke was in the
hospital.  B.
At the April 19, 2007, hearing, Judge Bissen recused
himself after recognizing Styke as an individual who had
"subletted a rental unit of this Court's."  Judge Bissen related
that he "did not have a positive view of [Styke]." 
Sotelo then orally moved to dismiss the TRO, on the
ground that the show-cause hearing was not held within fifteen
days of the granting of the TRO, which Soleto argued was required
by HRS § 586-5.  The parties agreed that Judge Bissen could rule
on the motion.  Judge Bissen denied the motion, noting that:  he
"couldn't hold [the April 12, 2007,] hearing without both parties
because [HRS §] 586-35 [sic]3. . . requires that both parties be
present"; Sotelo had not objected to the continuance of the
hearing from April 12, 2007, to April 19, 2007; and if Styke had
appeared at the April 12, 2007 hearing, Judge Bissen would have
recognized her and recused himself.  Judge Bissen further
explained that if Styke had appeared and Judge Bissen had recused
himself at the April 12, 2007, hearing, Judge Bissen would have
continued the hearing to April 26, 2007, which was "[t]he next
available date" when the Honorable Geronimo Valdriz, Jr., (Judge
Valdriz) "will be sitting in this courtroom instead of this
Court."  Judge Bissen then continued the show-cause hearing to
April 26, 2007, before Judge Valdriz. 
C.
At the commencement of the April 26, 2007 hearing,
Sotelo renewed his motion to dismiss the TRO.  Judge Valdriz
denied the motion, finding that "the hearing that the Court set
this hearing for and for which [Sotelo] did appear wasFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 Judge Tanaka entered the findings of fact and conclusions of law.4
4satisfactory enough for purposes of holding a hearing even though
that was continued.  So I'm not finding that they violated the
15-day rule." 
The evidentiary hearing on the order to show cause then
ensued.  As Styke's direct examination began, however, Judge
Valdriz recalled that he had presided over the preliminary
hearing for Sotelo's criminal case, which was based on the same
allegations of domestic abuse that supported the April 2, 2007,
TRO.  With respect to the preliminary hearing, Judge Valdriz
stated the he had found there "was a true bill . . . to indict
[Sotelo]."  At Sotelo's request, Judge Valdriz recused himself
and continued the hearing to May 3, 2007, before the Honorable
Keith E. Tanaka (Judge Tanaka).
II.
At the May 3, 2007, hearing, Sotelo once again sought
to dismiss the TRO.  Relying on Ling v. Yokoyama, 91 Hawai# i 131,
980 P.2d 1005 (App. 1999), Judge Tanaka orally granted the motion
and ruled that "today is May 3rd and that's way beyond the 15 day
period from April 2nd."  Judge Tanaka found that Styke's
hospitalization at the time of April 12, 2007, hearing
constituted exceptional circumstances justifying a continuance. 
However, Judge Tanaka ruled that the recusals of Judge Bissen and
Judge Valdriz did not constitute exceptional circumstances that
justified the continuances of the later hearings.  Judge Tanaka
noted that Sotelo was still subject to conditions of bail in his
criminal case, which Judge Tanaka believed prohibited Sotelo from
contacting Styke. 
On May 3, 2007, Judge Tanaka issued the Dissolution
Order which dissolved and vacated the TRO for "lack of
prosecution[.]"  This timely appeal followed, and on June 22,
2007, the family court4 entered "Findings of Fact and Conclusions
of Law," which concluded in relevant part:FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
5CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
1. That pursuant to [HRS §] 586-5(b), "on the earliest
date that the business of the Court will permit, but
no later than fifteen days from the date that the
[TRO] is granted, the Court, after giving due notice
to all parties, shall hold a hearing on the
application requiring cause to be shown why the order
should not continue. . . .";
2. That "shall hold a hearing" mandates that the hearing
be held within fifteen days.  Mi Suk Ling v. Haa Chun
Yokoyama, 91 Haw. 131 (1999);
3. That the term "held" mandates that the hearing shall
be on the merits of the action.  Mi Suk Ling v. Haa
Chun Yokoyama, 91 Haw. 131 (1999).
4. That in this case more than fifteen days had elapsed
since the granting of the [TRO], and as such the Court
grants the Motion to Dismiss.

DISCUSSION
On appeal, Styke argues that the family court erred in
concluding that (1) as a matter of law, HRS §586-5 and Ling
establish a strict mandate, regardless of the circumstances, that
a hearing must be held within 15 days of the granting of a TRO,
and (2) as a matter of fact, "the disqualifications of two family
court judges did not constitute exceptional circumstances that
warranted continuances." 
In response, Sotelo argues that the family court
correctly dissolved the TRO based on the plain language of HRS 
§ 586-5.  Sotelo notes that a TRO limits a "respondent's freedom
to move freely and communicate with members of the community[.]" 
Sotelo states that "[w]hen a [TRO] is dismissed because an order
to show cause hearing on it did not occur within the fifteen day
mandate of HRS [§] 586-5(b), the petitioner has another remedy,
to immediately file another [TRO] to be heard within the required
timeframe."  
For the reasons that follow, we hold that HRS
§ 586-5(b) did not compel dissolution of the TRO against Sotelo.FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 HRS § 586-5.5 (2006) authorizes the court to convert a TRO into a5
longer-lasting protective order upon making certain findings.  HRS § 586-5.5
provides in relevant part:
(a)  If, after hearing all relevant evidence, the court
finds that the respondent has failed to show cause why the order
should not be continued and that a protective order is necessary
to prevent domestic abuse or a recurrence of abuse, the court may
order that a protective order be issued for a further fixed
reasonable period as the court deems appropriate.
The protective order may include all orders stated in the
temporary restraining order and may provide for further relief as
the court deems necessary to prevent domestic abuse or a
recurrence of abuse, including orders establishing temporary
visitation and custody with regard to minor children of the
parties and orders to either or both parties to participate in
domestic violence intervention services. . . . 
6I.
HRS § 586-5 provides, in relevant part, as follows:
Period of order; hearing.  (a)  A temporary
restraining order granted pursuant to this chapter shall
remain in effect at the discretion of the court, for a
period not to exceed ninety days from the date the order is
granted.
     (b)  On the earliest date that the business of the
court will permit, but no later than fifteen days from the
date the temporary restraining order is granted, the court,
after giving due notice to all parties, shall hold a hearing
on the application requiring cause to be shown why the order
should not continue.  In the event that service has not been
effected, the court may set a new date for the hearing;
provided that the date shall not exceed ninety days from the
date the temporary restraining order was granted.  All
parties shall be present at the hearing and may be
represented by counsel.
     . . . .
(Emphases added.)5  The foregoing language clearly provides that
a hearing on an application for a TRO "shall" be held "no later
than fifteen days from the date the [TRO] is granted[.]"  
"It is a well-established that, where a statute
contains the word 'shall,' the provision generally will be
construed as mandatory."  Malahoff v. Saito, 111 Hawai# i 168,
191, 140 P.3d 401, 424 (2006).  In certain circumstances,
however, the term "shall" may be construed as directory rather
than mandatory with respect to the consequences of non-FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
7compliance.  Narmore v. Kawafuchi, 112 Hawai #i 69, 83, 143 P.3d
1271, 1285 (2006). 
In determining whether a statute is mandatory or directory
the intention of the legislature must be ascertained.  The
legislative intent may be determined from a consideration of
the entire act, its nature, its object, and the consequences
that would result from construing it one way or the other. 
In general, a statute is directory rather than mandatory if
the provisions of the statute do not relate to the essence
of the thing to be done or where no substantial rights
depend on compliance with the particular provisions and no
injury can result from ignoring them.
Jack Endo Elec., Inc. v. Lear Siegler, Inc., 59 Haw. 612, 617,
585 P.2d 1265, 1269 (1978) (quotation marks, ellipsis points, and
citations omitted).
The Hawai #i Supreme Court has observed that "when a
statute specifies what result will ensue if its terms are not
complied with, the statute is deemed mandatory.  Conversely, when
a statute merely requires certain things to be done and nowhere
prescribes the results that shall follow if such things are not
done, the statute is merely directory."  Narmore, 112 Hawai #i at
82, 143 P.3d at 1284 (quotation marks, brackets, and citations
omitted).  See also Perry v. Planning Comm'n of Hawaii County, 62
Haw. 666, 676, 619 P.2d 95, 103 (1980) ("Seemingly absolute time
periods for administrative action . . . are often considered mere
guides for the conduct of business with dispatch and for orderly
procedure.  They have generally been characterized as directory,
unless time is of the essence of the act required, the statute
contains negative language denying the exercise of authority
beyond the period prescribed for action, or a disregard of the
relevant provision would injuriously affect public interests or
private rights." (citations omitted)).
Stated differently, a statute specifying a time within which
public officials are required to perform an act is directory
unless the statute denies the exercise of power after such
time, or the nature of the act or the statutory language
indicates that the time was intended to be a limitation.  In
evaluating whether a provision is to be accorded directory
or mandatory effect, the objective of the court is to
ascertain the legislative intent.
Malahoff, 111 Hawai #i at 192, 140 P.3d at 425.  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 In addition, HRS § 586-5(b) itself allows the family court to ignore6
the fifteen-day provision and "set a new date for the hearing[,]" not to
exceed ninety days from the granting of the TRO, "[i]n the event service has
not been effected[.]"  
8The Hawai #i Supreme Court has identified several
circumstances in which the word "shall" can be construed as
directory:
First, "shall" can be read in a non-mandatory sense
when a statute's purpose confutes the probability of a
compulsory statutory design.  Second, "shall" will not be
read as mandatory when unjust consequences result.  Third,
the word "shall" may be held to be merely directory, when no
advantage is lost, when no right is destroyed, when no
benefit is sacrificed, either to the public or to the
individual, by giving it that construction.
Narmore, 112 Hawai# i at 83, 143 P.3d at 1285 (certain internal
quotation marks, brackets, and citations omitted).
II.
While HRS § 586-5(b) plainly instructs that the family
court "shall hold" a show-cause hearing within fifteen days of
the granting of a TRO, the statute is silent with respect to the
consequences of non-compliance.  Notably, HRS § 586-5 does not
provide that a TRO, which may be issued for a period of up to
ninety days, must be dissolved if a show-cause hearing is not
held within fifteen days of the granting of the TRO.6 
Insofar as HRS § 586-5(b) "nowhere prescribes the results
that shall follow [if a show-cause hearing is not held within
fifteen days]," Narmore, 112 Hawai #i at 82, 143 P.3d at 1284, and
does not "den[y] the exercise of power after such time,"
Malahoff, 111 Hawai #i at 192, 140 P.3d at 425, we conclude that
the statute's fifteen-day time period for holding a show-cause
hearing is directory.  See Shaw v. Packard, 886 A.2d 1287, 1290
(Me. 2005) ("If substantial reasons presented by either party
support the granting of a continuance [beyond the twenty-one-day
hearing requirement], the [protection-from-abuse] statute allows
the court to maintain the status quo by [granting a continuance
and] extending the effectiveness of the protection order.");
Jenkins v. Croft, 63 S.W.3d 710, 713 (Mo. Ct. App. 2002) (holdingFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
9that court's failure to comply with statute's fifteen-day hearing
requirement did not deprive the court of subject matter
jurisdiction to decide petition for order of protection).
III.
The legislative purposes for HRS § 586-5 and HRS
Chapter 586 support the interpretation of HRS § 586-5(b)'s
provision that the family court "shall hold" a show-cause hearing
within fifteen days as directory.  This court has previously
observed that the statutes concerning domestic abuse protective
orders (1) provide protection for an abused family or household
member and streamline the procedures to obtain a TRO to prevent
domestic abuse, (2) assure a period of separation between the
parties, and (3) have been amended over the years to better
protect domestic abuse victims:
HRS § 586-5 addresses the problem of domestic abuse by
providing protection for an abused family or household
member through the issuance of a restraining order.  The
legislature enacted HRS Chapter 586 in 1982 "to streamline
the procedures for obtaining and issuing ex parte temporary
restraining orders to prevent acts of or the recurrence of
domestic abuse."  Hse. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 1, in 1982 House
Journal, at 815; see also Hse. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 592, in
1982 House Journal, at 1165; Sen. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 4, in
1982 Senate Journal, at 873.  The Senate Standing Committee
Report found that a restraining order serves "to cool
violent relationships that have been developing for a number
of years" and that giving the court "the discretion to
extend protective orders" provides "greater flexibility in
trying to calm the emotionally charged nature of such
situations."  Sen. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 643, in 1982 Senate
Journal, at 1222.  Thus, the purpose of the restraining
order is to "prevent [] acts of abuse, or a recurrence of
actual domestic abuse, and assur[e] a period of separation
of the parties involved."  HRS § 586-4.
Later amendments to Chapter 586 sought "to better
protect the victims of domestic abuse."  Sen. Stand Comm.
Rep. No. 1444, in 1987 Senate Journal, at 1521.  The
legislature recognized "that many victims of domestic abuse
depend on protective orders to rescue them from violent
attacks and threats of abuse."  Hse. Stand. Comm. Rep. No.
549, in 1987 House Journal, at 1359.  Consequently, in 1991,
to "increase the effectiveness of protective orders," the
legislature extended "the duration of protective orders in
domestic abuse cases."  Sen. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 854, in
1991 Senate Journal, at 1059; see also Sen. Stand. Comm.
Rep. No. 1015, in 1991 Senate Journal, at 1107.  This
expansion of the protective period was based on "[c]urrent
information not[ing] that most women who had restraining
orders issued by the courts continue to be harassed or
threatened by their abusers for several years."  Hse. Stand.FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
10Comm. Rep. No. 524, in 1991 House Journal, at 1031.  Such
information led the legislature to conclude that "the
current six months allowed for protective orders [was] not
sufficient to protect women from the danger they continually
face from their abusers."  Id.
Coyle v. Compton, 85 Hawai #i 197, 204-05, 940 P.2d 404, 411-12
(App. 1997) (brackets in original; emphases added). 
If this court were to adopt Sotelo's interpretation of
HRS § 586-5(b), a ninety-day TRO, promptly served, that was
issued on a finding of probable cause of past or imminent acts of
abuse would automatically be dissolved fifteen days after being
granted, despite the best efforts of the family court and the
parties to convene a show-cause hearing.  Indeed, under Sotelo's
interpretation, the family court's failure to satisfy the
fifteen-day provision would result in the petitioner's automatic
loss of the protection of the TRO, even if the petitioner was not
to blame for any delay in setting the show-cause hearing.
While a petitioner, the purported victim of domestic
abuse, could request a second TRO, the purported victim would
bear the burden of reapplying and the risk of loss of protection
associated with the failure to convene a show-cause hearing
within fifteen days, under Sotelo's interpretation of HRS 
§ 586-5(b).  Adopting Sotelo's interpretation would undermine the
purpose of HRS Chapter 586, which is "to streamline the
procedures for obtaining and issuing ex parte temporary
restraining orders to prevent acts of or the recurrence of
domestic abuse[,]" Coyle, 85 Hawai# i at 205, 940 P.2d at 412
(internal quotation marks omitted), and to "ensur[e] a period of
separation of the parties involved."  HRS § 586-4(c) (2006). 
IV.
Although we conclude that the fifteen-day time period 
for holding a show-cause hearing in HRS § 586-5(b) is directory,
that does not mean that a court is free to disregard the
provision.  The fifteen-day time period is "directory" insofar as
the family court's non-compliance does not automatically compel
the dissolution of the TRO or invalidate subsequent action by theFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 Of course, where statutory interpretation is involved, the Legislature7
remains free to amend the statute and thereby alter what this court has done. 
State v. Garcia, 96 Hawai #i 200, 206, 29 P.3d 919, 925 (2001).
11court.  See People v. Harner, 262 Cal. Rptr. 422, 424-25 (Cal.
Ct. App. 1989).  However, the fifteen-day time period is not
permissive, and the family court is not free to follow the
provision or not as the court chooses.  See id. at 425.  We hold
that under HRS § 586-5(b), the court is obligated to hold a show-
cause hearing on a TRO within fifteen days from the date the TRO
is granted (where service has been effected) unless there is a
substantial reason amounting to good cause for a delay.  See
Shaw, 886 A.2d at 1289-90 (concluding that the court may continue
a hearing on a protection-from-abuse complaint if substantial
reasons support the granting of a continuance).  We believe that
this is a proper interpretation of HRS § 586-5(b) in light of the
Legislature's intent.7
  V.
Under the facts of this case, the parties and the
family court made every effort to convene the show-cause hearing
within fifteen days.  Surely, Styke's hospitalization and
consequent absence at the April 12, 2007, hearing and the
recusals of Judge Bissen and Judge Valdriz at the hearings on
April 19, 2007, and April 26, 2007, respectively, justified
continuing the show-cause hearing until both parties could appear
before an impartial judge.  See HRS § 586-5(b) ("All parties
shall be present at the [show-cause] hearing and may be
represented by counsel."); State v. Silva, 78 Hawai #i 115, 117,
890 P.2d 702, 704 (App. 1995) ("[A]n impartial judge is required
to insure a fair trial."), overruled on other grounds by
Tachibana v. State, 79 Hawai# i 226, 235 n.5, 900 P.2d 1293, 1320
n.5 (1993).  We conclude that there were substantial reasons
amounting to good cause for continuing the show-cause hearing on
the TRO beyond the fifteen-day period. FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 At the time Ling was decided, HRS § 604-10.5 provided in relevant8
part:
Power to enjoin and temporarily restrain harassment.
  . . . 
. . . .
(c)  Any person who has been subjected to harassment may
petition the district court of the district in which the
petitioner resides for a temporary restraining order and an
injunction from further harassment.
. . . .
(e)  Upon petition to a district court under this section,
the court may temporarily restrain for a period of fifteen days,
persons named in the petition from harassing the petitioner if the
alleged harassment has caused the petitioner substantial emotional
distress.  The court may issue an ex parte temporary restraining
order either in writing or orally, provided that oral orders shall
be reduced to writing by the close of the next court day following
oral issuance.
(f) A hearing on the petition to enjoin harassment shall be
held within fifteen days after it is filed. The parties named in
the petition may file responses explaining, excusing, justifying,
or denying the alleged act or acts of harassment.  The court shall
receive such evidence as is relevant at the hearing, and may make
independent inquiry.
If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that
harassment as defined in paragraph (1) of the definition exists,
it may enjoin for no more than three years further harassment of
the petitioner, or that harassment as defined in paragraph (2) of
that definition exists, it shall enjoin for no more than three
years further harassment of the petitioner . . . .
(Emphases added.)
12VI.
Finally, our decision in Ling, 91 Hawai #i 131, 980 P.2d
1005, the case relied on by the family court in its ruling, is
distinguishable because it construed a prior version of a
materially different harassment statute, HRS § 604-10.5 (1993 &
Supp. 1998).8
A.
In Ling, the petitioner filed a "Petition for Ex Parte
Temporary Restraining Order and for Injunction against
Harassment" on July 6, 1998.  Id. at 132, 980 P.2d at 1006.  The
district court granted the petitioner's ex parte request for aFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 We use "TRO" in referring to both a temporary restraining order issued9
pursuant to HRS § 604-10.5 and a temporary restraining order issued pursuant
to HRS Chapter 586. 
 On July 9, the respondent filed a competing petition against the10
petitioner.  The district court issued a fifteen-day TRO against the
petitioner and ordered the petitioner to appear for a show-cause hearing set
for the same date and time as the hearing arising out of petitioner's
petition.  Ling, 91 Hawai# i at 132, 980 P.2d at 1006.  
13temporary restraining order (TRO)9 against the respondent.  Id. 
The TRO was effective for fifteen days and directed the
respondent to appear at a July 13 hearing to show cause why the
orders prohibiting harassment contained in the TRO should not
continue to be effective.  Id.10  At the July 13 hearing, the
district court, over the petitioner's objection, granted the
request of the respondent's attorney to continue the matter for
two weeks until July 27 so the attorney could investigate the
case and prepare a response to the petitioner's petition; the
district court also extended the petitioner's TRO against the
respondent to July 27.  Id.  Subsequently, the district court
dismissed the petitioner's petition because "it did not find
enough basis to issue a restraining order."  Id. (internal
quotation marks omitted). 
On appeal, we agreed with the petitioner that HRS
§ 604-10.5 required a hearing on the merits to be held within
fifteen days and that the district court had erroneously
continued the hearing beyond the fifteen-day period.  Id. at 133-
34, 980 P.2d at 1007-08.  In construing the language "shall be
held" in HRS § 604-10.5(f), we concluded that "'shall' mandates
the petition hearing be held within the fifteen-day time
period[,]" Ling, 91 Hawai #i at 133-34, 980 P.2d at 1007-08, and
"'held' suggests that the parties must, at the least, convene or
meet in a hearing on the merits within the allotted time."  Id.
at 134, 980 P.2d at 1008.  Further, we noted that "[t]he fifteen-
day hearing requirement appears to coincide with the fifteen-day
TRO period" and thereby "ensures that the petitioner will have
the benefit of a court order prohibiting harassment pending theFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 HRS §§ 604-10.5(e) and (f) were substantially amended in 1999.  While11
the amendment essentially retained the fifteen-day hearing window, it allowed
the district court to issue a TRO "for a period not to exceed ninety days[,]"
as opposed to only fifteen days.  1999 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 143, § 1 at 460. 
HRS §§ 604-10.5(e) and (f) (Supp. 2009) currently state, in relevant part:
(e) Upon petition to a district court under this section,
the court may temporarily restrain the person or persons named in
(continued...)
14hearing on the petition."  Id.  As such, we concluded that "the
statutory time period was intended to benefit petitioners."  Id.
Examining the underlying facts in Ling, we observed
that a hearing on the merits "was not convened within the
fifteen-day period although [the p]etitioner was ready to
proceed" and the July 13 hearing "dealt only with continuing the
hearing, and at the court's suggestion, with considering
mediation of the dispute."  Id.  Nevertheless, we affirmed the
dismissal order because (1) even if the district court erred in
granting the continuance, the petitioner did not challenge the
district court's conclusion that "there was no evidentiary basis
on which to grant an injunction" and (2) any prejudice that the
petitioner might have incurred as a result of the continuance
"was dissipated by the extension of the TRO to the completion of
the hearing, which began on July 27, 1998."  Id. at 135, 980 P.2d
at 1009.  We explained as follows:
The effect of the extension was to maintain the court's
initial order against harassment until the case was decided. 
Although the continuance was in technical violation of the
mandate in HRS § 604-10.5(f), the protection intended to be
afforded a petitioner until a resolution of the petition
remained intact.
Id. (footnotes omitted).  We also noted that while "[t]here may
be exceptional circumstances under which a court may be compelled
to order a continuance, . . . any conceivable prejudice would
ordinarily be cured by extending the initial [TRO]."  Id. at 135

Unlike the harassment statute that we construed in
Ling,11 HRS § 586-5 allows the family court to issue a TRO "for aFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

the petition from harassing the petitioner upon a determination
that there is probable cause to believe that a past act or acts of
harassment have occurred or that a threat or threats of harassment
may be imminent. . . .
(f)  A temporary restraining order that is granted under
this section shall remain in effect at the discretion of the court
for a period not to exceed ninety days from the date the order is
granted.  A hearing on the petition to enjoin harassment shall be
held within fifteen days after the temporary restraining order is
granted.  In the event that service of the temporary restraining
order has not been effected before the date of the hearing on the
petition to enjoin, the court may set a new date for the hearing;
provided that the new date shall not exceed ninety days from the
date the temporary restraining order was granted.
     The parties named in the petition may file or give oral
responses explaining, excusing, justifying, or denying the alleged
act or acts of harassment.  The court shall receive all evidence
that is relevant at the hearing, and may make independent inquiry.
. . . .
(Emphasis added.)
 Under the harassment statute that we construed in Ling, the fifteen-12
day period for the TRO appeared to coincide with the fifteen-day period for a
hearing on the petition, although the two periods were not necessarily always
exactly equivalent.  Under that harassment statute, the district court was
authorized to issue a fifteen-day TRO upon a petition for relief from
harassment and was directed to hold a hearing within fifteen days after the
petition was filed.  HRS § 604-10.5 (e) and (f) (1993 & Supp. 1998).  Whenever
the district court issued the TRO on the day the petition was filed, the
fifteen-day period for the TRO and the fifteen-day period for the hearing were
the same.  However, it was possible that the fifteen-day periods for the TRO
and the hearing would not exactly match if the TRO was issued on a day after
the petition was filed.  
15period not to exceed ninety days[.]"  HRS § 586-5(a).  In Ling,
the harassment statute only permitted the district court to issue
a TRO for fifteen days, and the statute also provided that the
hearing on the petition to enjoin harassment "shall be held"
within a fifteen-day time period.12  The structure of the
harassment statute in Ling provided compelling evidence that the
Legislature intended the fifteen-day time period for holding a
hearing to be mandatory.  Because the TRO itself would only last
for fifteen days, if the court failed to hold a hearing on the
merits within fifteen days, it would create situations where the
TRO would expire by its own terms, leaving the petitioner, forFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
16whose benefit the fifteen-day period for a hearing was imposed,
without protection. 
Unlike in Ling, the ninety-day time period for which
the court is authorized to issue a TRO under HRS § 586-5 does not
coincide with the fifteen-day time period for a show-cause
hearing.  Thus, the structure of HRS § 586-5, which provides
insight into the Legislature's purpose in enacting the statute,
does not support the conclusion that the Legislature intended
that the failure to hold a show-cause hearing within fifteen days
would automatically result in the dissolution of a TRO under the
circumstances of this case.  The structure of HRS § 586-5 is
different from the structure of the harassment statute construed
in Ling, and Ling is distinguishable. 
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing discussion, we vacate the family
court's May 3, 2007, "Order Dissolving Temporary Restraining
Order for Protection" and its June 22, 2007, "Findings of Fact
and Conclusions of Law."
