NO. 28576
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
ALI E. JABALI, Plaintiff-Appellant,
 
vs.
 
CITY AND COUNTY OF HONOLULU, and
TRENT UENO, as an individual, Defendants-Appellees,
 
and
 
JOHN DOES 1-10, Defendants.
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 02-1-2329)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard, and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Ali E. Jabali (Jabali) appeals pro
 
se from the Judgment filed on May 23, 2007, in the Circuit Court
 
of the First Circuit (circuit court),1/ in favor of Defendants-
Appellees City and County of Honolulu (City) and Trent Umeno
 
(Umeno)2/ 
and against Jabali on all causes of actions raised in
Jabali's complaint.
 
Jabali filed a complaint in the circuit court against
 
the City and Umeno, a Honolulu police officer, alleging that
 Umeno and/or the City: 
1) violated Jabali's rights under the
 
Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the
 United States Constitution; 2) violated Jabali's rights under
 
1/  The Honorable Gary W.B. Chang presided. 
2/ Defendant-Appellee Trent Umeno's last name is misspelled in Jabali's
complaint as "Ueno," and this misspelling also appears in various pleadings
including the circuit court's Judgment. In answering the complaint, Umenoacknowledged that he was the person named in the complaint, and he pointed outthe misspelling of his name in pleadings filed with the circuit court. We will refer to Umeno by his correct name in this summary disposition order.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawaii Revised Statutes Chapters 368 and 378; and 3) were liable
 
for intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. 
Jabali also asserted that the City was liable under a theory of
 respondeat superior. The City and Umeno filed answers to
 Jabali's complaint, and they subsequently moved for summary
 judgment on all claims raised in the complaint. On March 23,
 
2007, the circuit court filed its order granting the City and
 
Umeno's motion for summary judgment, and the court also filed its
 Judgment on the same day. 
Jabali's opening brief does not comply with the 
requirement of Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 
28(b)(2006). It does not contain a subject index, table of authorities, a concise statement of the case, a concise statement of the points of error, or a section setting forth the applicable standards of review. These deficiencies alone provide a sufficient basis for this court to reject Jabali's appeal and affirm the circuit court's Judgment. See O'Connor v. Diocese of 
Honolulu, 77 Hawai'i 383, 385, 885 P.2d 361, 363 (1994) ("[F]ailure to comply with HRAP [Rule] 28(b)(4) is alone sufficient to affirm the judgment of the circuit court."); HRAP Rule 28(b)(7) ("Points not argued may be deemed waived."). 
In addition, Jabali's opening brief fails to inform
 
this court with any reasonable clarity or coherence of the
 specific errors Jabali is claiming on appeal or the reasons, with
 citations to relevant legal authority, that this court should
 overturn the circuit court. These additional deficiencies are of
 greater concern because they burden and impede this court by
 forcing us to guess at the substance of and basis for Jabali's
 appeal. 
Although we endeavor to decide cases on the merits, 
especially in the case of pro se litigants, Jabali's opening brief is deficient to such a degree that we are unable to do so in this appeal. Jabali has failed to present this court with discernable or coherent arguments upon which a decision can be rendered. See Hawaii Ventures, LLC v. Otaka, Inc., 114 Hawai
