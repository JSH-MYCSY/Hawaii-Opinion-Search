IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS

OF THE STATE OF HAWAI» I 
HAWAIIAN ASSOCIATION OF SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTS,
a Hawaii Non-Profit Corporation,
Plaintiff-Appellant, Cross-Appellee,
v.

STACEY T.J. WONG, As Trustee of
the Eric A. Knudsen Trust,
Defendant-Appellee, Cross-Appellant

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

(CIVIL NO. 03-1-0026)

MEMORANDUM OPINION

(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant/Cross-Appellee Hawaiian Association

of Seventh Day Adventists ("Association") appeals from the

May 21, 2007 Amended Final Judgment of the Circuit Court of the

Fifth Circuit
1 ("Circuit Court"), which resolved the claims

between the Association and Defendant-Appellee/Cross-Appellant

Stacey T.J. Wong ("Wong") as Trustee of the Eric A. Knudsen Trust

("EAK Trust"). Wong cross-appeals from the Amended Final
 
Judgment. 
 
On appeal, the Association claims that the Circuit

Court (1) erred by denying the Association's July 28, 2005 motion

for partial summary judgment with respect to Count I of the

March 10, 2003 Complaint ("Complaint"), (2) abused its discretion

by failing to issue findings of fact and conclusions of law

regarding its interpretation of paragraph 16 of the parties'

lease agreement ("Paragraph 16"), (3) failed to expressly exclude

certain evidence, (4) erred by denying the Association's motion
 
for reconsideration, and (5) should have granted the
 Association's August 25, 2005 motion for partial summary judgment
 on Counts I, II and IV of the April 1, 2003 Counterclaim
 ("Counterclaim"). 
In his cross-appeal, Wong argues that the Circuit Court
 
erred (1) by granting the Association's August 10, 2005 motion
 for partial summary judgment on Count I of the Counterclaim 
because termination of the lease was warranted, (2) by granting
 the Association's August 10, 2005 motion for partial summary
 judgment on Counts II and III of the Counterclaim because Wong
 was entitled to damages for improper use of the subject property
 and the unjust revenues generated therefrom, (3) by denying
 Wong's August 17, 2005 motion for summary judgment based upon the
 Association's violation of the lease through its failure to
 comply with county and Land Use Commission conditions because the
 Association failed to start an agricultural work-study program
 and improperly rented cabins to the general public, and (4) by
 denying Wong's August 25, 2005 motion for partial summary
 judgment with respect to Count VI of the Complaint because the
 Association's claim for damages should have been struck. 
Finally, both the Association and Wong contest the Circuit
 Court's award of attorneys' fees and costs.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
A. History and Use of the Property
 
The subject property is a parcel of approximately 197 
acres of land situated in Kôloa, Kaua� i (the "Property"). The 
Property was originally owned by EAK Trust and the Augustus F. Knudsen Trust (jointly, "the Trusts"). In 1949, the Trusts leased the Property to Valdemar L'Orange Knudsen who, in turn, assigned the lease to Kahili Mountain Park, Inc. ("KMPI"), a company owned by several Knudsen family members. KMPI developed a commercial campground on the Property called Kahili Mountain Park ("Park"). The Park originally featured structures called "cabinettes," which were described as "cement slab[s] with . . . low surrounding wall[s], with . . . tent structure[s] over 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
[them.]" Based on its guests' recommendations, KMPI later built
 
cabins, which featured electricity and private bathrooms. KMPI
 rented the cabins and cabinettes to the general public for
 vacation use. 
In 1982, the Association and KMPI entered into an
 
agreement whereby the Association would purchase all of KMPI's
 capital stock, including its leasehold interest in the Park. On
 December 31, 1984, the Association and the Trusts entered into a
 new sixty-year lease for the Property beginning on January 1,
 1985 (the "Lease"). Paragraph 16 of the Lease prescribes the
 allowable uses for the Property:
 
16. Use of Demised Premises. The demised premises
shall be used only for educational, recreation (including
vacation residence for members and staff of Lessee's school
 and church), agricultural, health care and humanitarian
uses. No dwellings shall be constructed or used on the
demised premises except for faculty, administrative staff,
students and employees. If Lessee ceases to use the demised
 premises for the above purposes, Lessor shall have the right
to terminate this Lease.
 
The Association relocated a K-12 school ("School") to
 
the Property and constructed some new structures, including
 
houses for School faculty and staff and some additional cabins. 
The Association continued KMPI's practice of renting cabins to
 the general public with the rental income used to support the
 School. In 1995, EAK Trust acquired a 100% fee interest in the
 Property. The parties pointed to no evidence of any disagreement
 between the parties concerning the Association's cabin-rental
 program until approximately 2001.
 
In an April 11, 2001 letter to the Association
 
("April 11, 2001 Letter"), Wong, as trustee for the EAK Trust,
 stated, "I believe we are in agreement that the Adventists are in
 material default of the Kahili Adventist School/Mountain Park
 lease with respect to the Article 16."
2 The letter did not
 
explain how the Association was in violation of the Lease. It
 did warn, however, that under the defeasance provision in
 
2
 The April 11, 2001 Letter explained that on August 28, 2000, Wong
had been appointed as the Successor Trustee for the EAK Trust and that his
responsibilities included "ensuring strict compliance with [EAK Trust's]
leases."
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
3Paragraph 19 provides, in relevant part:
Defeasance . Paragraph 19 of the Lease ("Paragraph 19"),3 EAK Trust could
pursue remedies including termination of the lease, eviction, and
a suit for monetary damages and legal fees.  
The April 11, 2001 Letter noted that the EAK Trust
fully supported the Association's vision of establishing a
wellness and conditioning center on the Property.  Wong added
that he was also interested in expanding the amenities available
to the students of the School and guests of the Park to include a
hot-springs bath, cold-plunge pool, weight/ cardiovascular
equipment room, and facilities for aerobics, yoga and meditation
classes.4  
Wong proposed that the Association could "satisfy the
past breach" by paying EAK Trust 10% of cabin-rental-related
gross revenues, plus simple 10% interest, for the period from
 This demise is conditionally limited as
follows:
(1) If Lessee . . . (2) shall fail faithfully to
observe or perform any of the covenants herein contained and
on the part of Lessee to be observed and performed, and any
such default shall continue for thirty (30) days after
written notice thereof is given by Lessor . . . Lessor may
at once enter into and upon the demised premises or any part
thereof in the name of the whole and at Lessor's option
terminate this Lease, or without necessity of physical entry
cancel this Lease by mailing a written notice to Lessee at
the last known address of Lessee, or at such other address
of which Lessee has notified Lessor in writing prior thereto
if receipt of said notice (of change of address) has been
acknowledged in writing by Lessor, and thereupon take
possession of said premises and all improvements thereon and
become wholly vested with all rights, title and interest of
Lessee therein, and may expel and remove from said premises
Lessee, or those claiming under Lessee, and their effects,
all without service of notice or resort to any legal process
and without being deemed guilty of any trespass or becoming
liable for any loss or damage which may be occasioned
thereby, and without prejudice to any other remedy or right
of action which Lessor may have for collection of arrears of
rent or for other or preceding breach of covenant by Lessee,
and in case of such termination of this Lease, Lessee shall
be liable to Lessor for all losses and damages sustained by
Lessor on account of Lessee's breach of said terms and
covenants and/or conditions, and/or on account of the
premises remaining unleased or being let for the remainder
of the term hereby demised for a lesser rent than that
herein reserved. . . .
4Wong characterized his proposal as the continued operation of the
Park, "but in a professional manner calculated to maximize revenues and
service quality to its guests."
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
July 1, 1984 to November 30, 2000. Moving forward, Wong
 
recommended that the Association prepare a detailed five-year
 business plan that would include proposed programs and
 improvements for both the School and the Park. If the plan was
 accepted, EAK Trust would enter into a new lease permitting the
 proposed commercial uses with the Association under which the
 Association would pay rent of 10% of gross non-School-related
 revenues. 
On January 7, 2002, the Association submitted a letter
 
and attached a document entitled "Phase I – Validation &
 Recommendation Research Report" prepared by Business Consulting
 Resources ("BCR Report").
5 According to the Association, it
 
retained Business Consulting Resources for the project at Wong's
 recommendation. 
In a letter dated January 15, 2002, Wong responded to
 
the Association's January 7, 2002 letter and the BCR Report. 
Wong began by noting that he could "not begin to
 communicate . . . [his] disappointment." Wong asserted that the
 BCR Report "is not a five (5)-year business plan. It lacks the
 focus, integration and specific proposals found in a real
 business plan." Wong noted that the Association had never
 formally responded to an interim proposal that he had offered in
 October 2001 and said that, contrary to the Association's stated
 understanding, he had not agreed to forgive back percentage rent. 
Wong stated that he would no longer discuss or negotiate the
 matter, but allowed the Association to submit a final settlement
 proposal by February 18, 2002, at which point he would either
 accept or reject it. 
The parties have directed us to no responsive
 
communication in the record. On March 6, 2002, Wong sent a
 further letter on behalf of EAK Trust to the Association
 demanding that it cease commercial vacation rental operations on
 the Property by April 15, 2002 ("March 6, 2002 Letter"). Wong
 
5
 Among other things, the Association's January 7, 2002 letter took
issue with Wong's proposal concerning "the past monetary claim," which, the
letter contended was to have been "forgiven at the rate of 20% a year as
milestones on a five-year business plan were achieved."
 
5
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
subsequently extended the deadline to October 31, 2002 to allow
 
the Association to honor any reservations made prior to March 6,
 2002.
 
B. The Association's Complaint and Wong's Counterclaim
 On March 10, 2003, the Association filed its Complaint.
 
Among other things, the Association sought, in Count I, a
 declaratory judgment that "continued operation of 'Kahili
 Mountain Park' and vacation rental of the cabins . . . is
 permitted by the terms of the Lease" ("Count I of the
 Complaint"), and in Count VI, damages for Wong's wrongful demand
 that the Association halt its vacation rentals to the general
 public ("Count VI of the Complaint"). 
On April 1, 2003, Wong filed his Counterclaim in which
 
he: (1) sought, in Count I, termination of the Lease based on his
 allegation that the Association was in violation of the terms and
 conditions of the Lease ("Count I of the Counterclaim"); (2)
 claimed, in Count II, that the Association breached its contract
 by conducting prohibited commercial operations on the Property by
 failing to comply with the conditions of the Special Permits
 issued for the use of the Property and by failing and refusing to
 pay rent to Wong for the prohibited commercial operations
 conducted on the Property ("Count II of the Counterclaim");
 
(3) claimed, in Count III, that by operating prohibited
 
commercial operations on the Property, the Association had been
 unjustly enriched and should be disgorged of its profits ("Count
 III of the Counterclaim"); and (4) alleged, in Count IV, that
 under the Lease, the Association was obligated to defend and
 indemnify Wong for any loss or damage in connection with the
 Lease. 
C. Orders Granting Summary Judgment
 The parties each filed multiple motions for partial
 
summary judgment. In sum, the Circuit Court granted summary
 judgment to Wong on Counts I, II, III, and IV of the
 Association's Complaint. In addition, the Circuit Court granted
 summary judgment to the Association on Count VI of the Complaint
 despite the fact that the Association did not move for summary
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
judgment on that count. Finally, the Circuit Court granted the
 
Association summary judgment on all counts of Wong's
 Counterclaim. 
The Circuit Court did not state the grounds upon which
 
it granted or denied each motion. The Association moved for
 clarification on the summary judgment orders pertaining to Count
 I of the Complaint and Count I of the Counterclaim and for
 reconsideration of the orders. At a November 8, 2005 hearing,
 the Circuit Court explained that it found the Lease to be
 unambiguous and that it, therefore, did not use any parol
 evidence in making its decisions. The Circuit Court stated that
 although cabin rentals were not permitted under the Lease, the
 violations were insufficient to terminate the Lease or had been
 timely cured. The Circuit Court denied the Association's motion
 for clarification of its prior summary judgment orders and the
 Association's motion for reconsideration of summary judgment. 
D. Attorneys' Fees and Costs
 Paragraph 11 of the Lease provides:
 
Lessee will pay to Lessor all costs and expenses, including
reasonable attorney's fees incurred by Lessor in enforcing any of
the covenants, terms and conditions in this Lease contained, in
remedying any breach thereof, in collecting any delinquent rent,
taxes or other charges hereunder payable by Lessee, in connection
with any litigation (other than condemnation proceedings)
commenced by or against Lessee to which Lessor shall without fault
be made a party.
 
On December 1, 2005, Wong filed his motion for taxation
 
of costs and award of attorney's fees. Wong sought costs in the
 
amount of $68,040.38 and fees in the amount of $308,797.50. 
Wong's attorney submitted a declaration explaining that he had
 made a good-faith effort to exclude from the total any fees
 related to the Counterclaim. 
On February 22, 2006 the Circuit Court entered an order
 
granting Wong's motion for taxation of costs and award of
 attorney's fees ("Order Granting Fees and Costs"). The Circuit
 Court awarded Wong costs in the amount of $27,206.90 and fees in
 the amount of $60,270.00, for a total of $87,476.90. The Circuit
 Court did not explain how it arrived at the amount of fees or
 costs it awarded.

E. Amended Final Judgment
 
On May 21, 2007, the Circuit Court entered the Amended
 
Final Judgment: (1) in favor of Wong and against the Association
 on Counts I, II, III, and IV of the Complaint; (2) in favor of
 the Association and against Wong on Counts I, II, III and IV of
 
6
the Counterclaim; (3) dismissing Count VI of the Complaint;  (4)
awarding Wong $
87,476.90 in attorneys' fees and costs; and (5)
 
dismissing all claims and counterclaims not specifically
 identified in the Amended Final Judgment. 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
Summary Judgment
 
The appellate court reviews "the circuit court's grant 
or denial of summary judgment de novo. Under the de novo 
standard, [the appellate court examines] the facts and answer[s] the question without being required to give any weight to the circuit court's answer to it." Haw. Ventures, LLC v. Otaka, 
Inc., 114 Hawai� i 438, 457, 164 P.3d 696, 715 (2007) (internal 
quotation marks, citations, and brackets omitted). 
Equitable Relief
 
"A declaratory judgment is a form of equitable relief." 
Kau v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 104 Hawai� i 468, 473, 92 P.3d 
477, 482 (2004). The circuit court's decision granting or denying such equitable relief is reviewed for abuse of discretion. Id.; Ingledue v. Dyer, 85 Hawai� i 84, 91, 937 P.2d 
925, 932 (App. 1997). 
Contract Interpretation
 
As a general rule, the construction and legal effect
to be given a contract is a question of law freely
reviewable by an appellate court. The determination whether
 a contract is ambiguous is likewise a question of law that
is freely reviewable on appeal. These principles apply
equally to appellate review of the construction and legal
effect to be given a contractual agreement to arbitrate. 
6
 The Circuit Court dismissed Count VI even though it had earlier
granted summary judgment to the Association on that count. It is unclear why
the Circuit Court dismissed Count VI, as no related stipulation by the parties
or decision by the court appears in the record.

Brown v. KFC Nat'l Mgmt. Co., 82 Hawai� i 226, 239, 921 P.2d 146, 
159 (1996) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). 
Motion for Reconsideration
 
[T]he purpose of a motion for reconsideration is to allow
the parties to present new evidence and/or arguments that
could not have been presented during the earlier adjudicated
motion. Reconsideration is not a device to relitigate old
matters or to raise arguments or evidence that could and
should have been brought during the earlier proceeding.

Sousaris v. Miller, 92 Hawai� i 505, 513, 993 P.2d 539, 547 
(2000)). The appellate court reviews a "trial court's ruling on a motion for reconsideration . . . under the abuse of discretion standard." Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua, 100 Hawai� i

and costs is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard." Sierra Club v. Dep't of Transp., 120 Hawai� i 181, 197, 202 P.3d 
1226, 1242 (internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets omitted).

 of the opinion that it has injuriously affected the substantial
 rights of the appellant." H

III. DISCUSSION
 
A.	 The Association's Points of Error
 
1.	 The Circuit Court erred in granting Wong summary
judgment on Count I of the Complaint.
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Association contends in its first point of error
 
that the Circuit Court erred in denying the Association's motion
 
for summary judgment on Count I of the Complaint. Implicit in
 that, under the circumstances, is a claim that the Circuit Court
 also erred in granting summary judgment to Wong on that count. 
While we are unable to conclude on the record provided whether
 the Association is entitled to declaratory judgment, we are able
 to conclude that the Circuit Court erred in granting summary
 judgment to Wong on the legal basis that it stated.
 
The record is replete with evidence of cabin rentals on 
the Property over time and the intentions and opinions of various people connected with the Lease and the Property's operation. Nevertheless, as the Circuit Court found the Lease to be unambiguous and did not take parol evidence into account in reaching its decision, the issue before us is whether Paragraph 16 unambiguously permits or prohibits the vacation rental of cabins on the Property to members of the general public. Our review of the Circuit Court's grant of summary judgment on legal grounds is de novo. Haw. Ventures, 114 Hawai� i at 457, 164 P.3d 
at 715; Brown, 82 Hawai� i at 239, 921 P.2d at 159; accord SCI 
Minn. Funeral Servs., Inc. v. Washburn-McReavy Funeral Corp., 795 N.W.2d 855, 861 (Minn. 2011) (when reviewing a trial court's grant of summary judgment on a claim for equitable relief, the standard of review is de novo if the trial court granted summary judgment on legal grounds). 
Whether a contractual term is ambiguous is a pure 
question of law capable of judicial resolution. Found. Int'l, 
Inc. v. E.T. Ige Constr., Inc., 102 Hawai� i 487, 496, 78 P.3d 23, 
32 (2003). "[T]erms of a contract should be interpreted according to their plain, ordinary and accepted use in common speech, unless the contract indicates a different meaning." Amfac, Inc., 74 Haw. at 108, 839 P.2d at 24 (quoting Azer v. Myers, 8 Haw. App. 86, 123, 793 P.2d 1189, 1212 (1990)) (internal quotation marks omitted). "A contract is ambiguous when the terms of the contract are reasonably susceptible to more than one meaning." Airgo, Inc. v. Horizon Cargo Transp., Inc., 66 Haw. 
590, 594, 670 P.2d 1277, 1280 (1983) (citing Hennigan v. Chargers 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Football Co., 431 F.2d 308, 314 (5th Cir. 1980)). "The court 
should look no further than the four corners of the document to determine whether an ambiguity exists." Williams v. Aona, 121 
Hawai�i 1, 15, 210 P.3d 501, 515 (2009) (quoting United Pub. 
Workers, AFSCME, Local 646, AFL-CIO v. Dawson Int'l, Inc., 113 Hawai�i 127, 140, 149 P.3d 495, 508 (2006)). 
a. The import of Paragraph 16's first sentence
 
The first sentence of Paragraph 16 does not authorize
 
or exclude use of the Property by the Association or any
 particular class of individuals. The Association argues, and we
 agree, that Paragraph 16's parenthetical phrase "including
 vacation residence for members and staff of Lessee's school and
 church" does not prohibit the rental of cabins to the general
 public for vacation purposes. See Lealaimatafao v. Woodward-
Clyde Consultants, 75 Haw. 544, 557, 867 P.2d 220, 226 (1994)
 (the word "'including' in no way implies exclusivity'"). 
Instead, it demonstrates that "vacation residence" is within the
 scope of permitted recreational uses of the Property. That, of
 course, does not resolve the issue as there is no indication that
 the Circuit Court's ruling was dependant upon any such
 misapprehension.
 
While the Property can "only" be put to educational,
 
recreational, agricultural, health care, and humanitarian uses,
 nothing in the text suggests that the Association is prohibited
 from collecting revenue from the permissible use of the Property. 
Illustrating this point, Paragraph 16 plainly permits the
 Association to use the Property to run a school, farm, or medical
 clinic. Whether the Association charges students a tuition,
 sells the harvest, or charges patients fees for the provision of
 medical treatment is merely derivative of and incidental to these
 uses. As is relevant here, Paragraph 16 does not limit the
 recreational use of the Property to persons affiliated with the
 Association. Nor does it prevent the Association from collecting
 revenue from its recreational activities. Simply, Paragraph 16
 does not mandate that guests using the Property for vacation
 residence must be permitted to do so free of charge, if at all. 
11
  
  
  
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
If the parties wished, they could have included a provision in
 
the Lease prohibiting the Association from generating revenue
 from the otherwise permissible use of the Property. They failed
 to do so, and the absence of such a provision does not create an
 ambiguity. See Collins v. Goetsch, 59 Haw. 481, 487, 583 P.2d
 
353, 358 (1978) (In determining the meaning of language used in
 restrictive covenants, "the controlling factor is expressed
 intent, and unexpressed intent is generally 'unavailing.'").
 
b. The import of Paragraph 16's second sentence
 
The second sentence of Paragraph 16, however, states
 
that "[n]o dwellings shall be constructed or used on the demised
 premises except for faculty, administrative staff, students and
 employees." The question, then, is whether the term "dwellings"
 in the second sentence in Paragraph 16 could reasonably be
 interpreted as prohibiting use of the cabins as temporary
 vacation residences by the general public.
 
A "dwelling" may simply mean "having a roof over one's
 
head and a certain number of square meters at disposal." 
C
HRISTIAN NORBERG-SCHULZ, THE CONCEPT OF DWELLING 12 (1985). In criminal
 
statutes such as Chapter 708 of Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS"),
 the term is defined to mean "a building which is used or usually
 used by a person for lodging[,]" H
AW. REV. STAT. § 708-800
 
(1993), and can generally refer to any "enclosed space that is
 used or intended for use as a human habitation." B
LACK'S LAW
 
DICTIONARY 582 (9th ed. 2009) (definition of dwelling-house); see
 
also H AW. REV. STAT. § 703-300 (1993) ("'Dwelling' means any
 
building or structure, though movable or temporary, or a portion
 thereof, which is for the time being a home or place of
 lodging."); United States v. McClenton, 53 F.3d 584, 587 (3d Cir.
 1995) (a hotel room is a "dwelling," albeit "on a transient or
 temporary basis[,]" for the purposes of the federal sentencing
 guidelines); cf. United States v. Whitted, 541 F.3d 480, 488 (3d
 Cir. 2008) (as used in the context of search-and-seizure
 jurisprudence, "[t]he sanctity of private dwellings, whether
 temporary or permanent, ordinarily gives rise to the most
 stringent Fourth Amendment protection" (citations and internal
 
12
    
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
quotation marks omitted)).
 
On the other hand, the word "dwelling" may suggest 
stronger connections between person, space, and time. The word 
"dwell," the root of the word "dwelling," has a definitive temporal aspect: to dwell is "to remain for a time" or "to live as a resident." M
ERRIAM-WEBSTER'S COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY 389 (11th ed. 
2003); B LACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 582 (9th ed. 2009) (to dwell is "[t]o 
reside in a place permanently or for some period <he dwelled in California for nine years>"). Whether a building is a "dwelling" could depend on the length or permanency of residence. For instance, under Rule 4 of the Hawai� i Rules of Civil Procedure 
("HRCP"), service of process may be made upon an individual "at the individual's dwelling house or usual place of abode[.]" Haw. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(1)(A). While judges have struggled with the
 precise meaning of these words, courts hold that a structure is
 not a person's dwelling place if "a more permanent residence is
 shown to exist" or "if the defendant is only an occasional
 visitor at a particular place."

MILLER, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 1096 (3d ed. 2002).
 
c.	 Reading Paragraph 16's first and second
sentences in concert
 
While, standing alone, "dwellings" could be an
 
ambiguous term, it is unambiguous in the context of Paragraph 16. 
The term "vacation residence" is unambiguous — it means to reside
 while on vacation.
8 "Vacation residence" is a permitted use of
 
the Property. Paragraph 16 explicitly states that church members
 may use the Property for vacation residence. The use of
 "dwellings" on the Property, however, is limited to faculty,
 administrative staff, students, and employees. It is illogical
 that a given use of the Property (vacation residence by church
 
7
 The word "dwelling" may also connote something more profound than
a place where people sleep at night or a structure that provides some
protection from the elements. "Dwelling" tends to suggest a deeper, more
"meaningful relationship between man and a given environment." See CHRISTIAN
 
NORBERG-SCHULZ, THE CONCEPT OF DWELLING 13 (1985).

 "Vacation" is defined as "a period spent away from home or

Co., 847 F.2d 564, 566–67 (9th Cir. 1988) ("The normal rule of

("An interpretation will not be given to one part of a contract
 which will annul another part of it . . . ."). Thus, we hold
 that the term "dwellings," as used in Paragraph 16, means
 structures used or constructed for use as primary, non-
recreational residences, but not structures used or constructed
 for use as temporary vacation residences.
 
The issue presented in Count I of the Complaint is
 
whether the Association can rent "cabins to the public on a
 vacation rental basis." Based on the record before us, it
 appears that at least some of the "cabins" were not constructed
 for use as "dwellings," as that term is used in Paragraph 16.
9
 
Furthermore, it is undisputed that the cabins were being used for
 vacation rentals. Thus, based on material facts in the record,
 the Circuit Court's decision to grant Wong's motion for partial
 summary judgment on Count I of the Complaint based on its
 interpretation of the Lease was erroneous.
 
That does not mean, however, that the Association is
 
entitled to summary judgment on Count I of the Complaint. The
 Association is obligated on summary judgment to demonstrate its
 entitlement to declaratory relief as a matter of law. It failed
 to do so here. Thus, we hold that the Circuit Court properly
 denied the Association's motion for summary judgment on Count I
 of the Complaint.
 
Therefore, we vacate that portion of paragraph 1 of the
 
Amended Final Judgment that granted judgment in favor of Wong on
 Count I of the Complaint and remand for further proceedings in
 light of our opinion.
 
9
 That is not to say that the record gives us a clear understanding
of what these cabins are. The record reveals very little about what the
cabins looked like, how they were used, and who used them. These are issues
 that may be examined on remand.

2.	 The Circuit Court did not err by failing to issue
findings of fact and conclusions of law.
 
The Association contends in its second point of error
 
that the Circuit Court erroneously failed to issue findings of
 
fact and conclusions of law to support its summary judgment
 orders. The Circuit Court did not err. Under HRCP Rule 52(a),
 "findings of fact and conclusions of law are unnecessary in
 summary judgments. This is because disputed issues of fact
 cannot be resolved on summary judgment."
10 Dalton v. City &
 
Cnty. of Honolulu, 51 Haw. 400, 403 n.2, 462 P.2d 199, 203 n.2
 (1969). Here, since the Circuit Court disposed of the case on
 summary judgment, the Circuit Court was not required to issue
 findings of fact or conclusions of law.
 
3.	 The Association's third point of error is moot.
 
The Association argues that the Circuit Court
 
erroneously failed to expressly exclude certain evidence when it
 granted Wong's motion for summary judgment on Count I of the
 Complaint. Because we hold that the order granting Wong's motion
 for summary judgment on Count I of the Complaint was in error,
 the issue is moot.
 
4.	 The Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in
 
denying the Association's motion for
reconsideration.
 
The Association argues in its fourth point of error
 
that the Circuit Court erred by failing "to reconsider its ruling
 
regarding the interpretation of the use provision of the Lease,
 including its failure to follow Lealaimatafao v. Woodward-Clyde
 Consultants, 75 Haw. 544, 556, 867 P.2d 220, 226 (1994)." The
 Association further argues that the Circuit Court erred in
 failing to find that clear legal error is grounds for
 
10
 The Supreme Court also stated, however, that "[t]rial courts are
not prevented from entering conclusions of law . . . and in the present case a
clear statement of the conclusions of law in each judgment would have
facilitated the appeal." Dalton, 51 Haw. at 403 n.2, 462 P.2d at 203 n.2.
The sentiment applies with equal force in this case.

reconsideration of an interlocutory order.11
 
Irrespective of the well-settled proper scope of a 
motion for reconsideration in Hawai� i, e.g., Omerod v. Heirs of 
Kaheananui, 116 Hawai� i 239, 269–71, 172 P.3d 983, 1013–15 
(2007), we have already held that the Circuit Court erred in 
granting summary judgment in favor of Wong on Count I of the Complaint on the basis of the Lease's terms. Consequently, the point of error is moot. 
5. The Association waived its fifth point of error.
 
The Association argues that the Circuit Court erred 
when it failed to grant its Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Counts I, II and IV of the Counterclaim. For the purposes of this point of error, the Association stated in its opening brief that it "relies on the arguments made in its pleadings and during oral argument and makes no further argument in this Opening Brief." This is obviously not permitted under Hawai� i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure ("HRAP") Rule 28(a) and Rule 28(b)(7). Since this violates our rules, we will disregard the point. Kapiolani 
Comm. Ctr. v. A & S P'ship, 68 Haw. 580, 584, 723 P.2d 181, 184–85 (1986). 
B. Wong's Points of Error
 1. Termination of the Lease is not warranted.
 
Wong argues in his first point of error that he is
 
entitled to termination of the Lease because the Association
 willfully violated Paragraph 16 by renting cabins to the general
 public. The Association argues that any violation was timely
 cured. 
Pursuant to Paragraph 19, if the Association "shall
 
fail faithfully to observe or perform any of the covenants herein
 contained and on the part of Lessee to be observed and performed,
 and any such default shall continue for thirty (30) days after
 written notice thereof is given by Lessor[,]" Wong is entitled to
 terminate the Lease. There is a caveat, however:
 
11
 The Association's October 7, 2005 motion for reconsideration
raised issues other than the interpretation of the Lease's use provision.
Those issues, however, are not addressed in the point of error.
 
16
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
 
[B]efore any forfeiture shall be enforced, Lessor shall give
written notice to Lessee of the breach constituting the
ground of forfeiture, and Lessee shall have thirty (30) days
from the date of such notice within which to remedy or cure
such breach, and if such breach shall be so cured or
remedied, then such breach shall be waived and no forfeiture
shall be enforced for such breach, but if such breach shall
not have been so remedied or cured within said period or
within such additional time as Lessor may allow, then Lessor
may enforce Lessor's rights of forfeiture.
 
The March 6, 2002 Letter explained the basis for the
 
12
claimed default :
Shortly after the undersigned became trustee of the
Trust, it became known that the Association had been
conducting a commercial vacation rental operation on the
Land since 1985, renting the cabins located thereon to the
general public. The Association had not reported such
income to the Lessor nor had the Association paid percentage
rent upon such gross receipts. Such use of the Land was a
 clear violation of the use clause of the Lease, a fact that
the Association admits. The preceding constitutes default
by the Association under the terms of the Lease.
 
In addition, Wong demanded that, "on or before April 15, 2002,
 
the Association cease all commercial vacation rental
 operations[.]" 
On March 13, 2002, the Association sent Wong's attorney
 
a letter stating that it would comply and cease all commercial
 vacation rental operations by April 15, 2002. However, in an
 April 2, 2002 letter to the Association's counsel, Wong's counsel
 stated:
 
the Trust does not desire to create hardship for persons
with vacation cabin reservations in the near term. The
 Trust will, therefore, allow the Church to honor all
reservations for the period through October 31, 2002, if the
reservations were made prior to Mr. Wong's letter of March
6, 2002. This consideration is given while reserving all
rights of the Trust in this matter. After October 31, 2002,
the Trust expects the Church to abide by the use
restrictions contained in the Lease.
 
The Association presented undisputed evidence that "[o]ther than
 
honoring those existing reservations, rental of cabins to non­Adventist[s] ceased within 30 days after Wong's notice." 
The March 6, 2002 Letter constitutes notice under the
 
Lease. However, the undisputed evidence shows that even if the
 Association had misused the Property, it cured any breach within
 
12
 Although it appears that Wong had asserted additional grounds for
termination beyond the rental of cabins to the general public, Wong does not
address them in his argument. Thus, we will not consider them. See Haw. R.
 
App. P. 28(b)(7).
 
17
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
the time allotted by the Lease. On April 2, 2002, Wong
 
explicitly permitted the Association to honor existing
 reservations through October 31, 2002. And, as stated above, the
 evidence shows that "[o]ther than honoring those existing
 reservations, rental of cabins to non-Adventist[s] ceased within
 30 days after Wong's notice." Wong has not demonstrated that the
 Association was required to make any monetary payment to cure the
 breach under the Lease. Thus, any potential breach of the Lease
 for the impermissible rental of cabins was timely cured.
 
Therefore, Wong is not entitled to termination of the
 
Lease, and the Circuit Court did not err in granting the
 Association's motion for partial summary judgment on Count I of
 the Counterclaim.
 
2.	 
Wong is not entitled to damages upon the theory
presented on appeal.
 
In his second point of error, Wong contends that the
 
Circuit Court erred by granting the Association's motion for
 
partial summary judgment on Counts II and III of the
 Counterclaim. Count II of the Counterclaim seeks damages for
 breach of contract, and Count III is a stand-alone unjust-
enrichment claim. 
Wong argues that a trial court, sitting in equity, may
 
grant a lessee relief against forfeiture for the breach of a
 covenant in a lease if the lessor "can reasonably and adequately
 be compensated for his injury." See Food Pantry, Ltd. v. Waikiki
 
Business Plaza, Inc., 58 Haw. 606, 613–14, 575 P.2d 869, 875—76
 (1978). This argument relates solely to the remedy that Wong is
 entitled to if the Circuit Court finds there to have first been a
 breach of the Lease capable of raising the issue of forfeiture. 
That argument is misplaced here, where we hold that the Circuit
 Court erred in granting Wong summary judgment on Count I of the
 Complaint, but properly granted summary judgment against him on
 
Count I of the Counterclaim. 
Therefore, Wong has not shown
 
error.
 
3. Wong failed to argue his third point of error.
 
As his third point of error, Wong contends that the
 
18
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Association "violated the terms of its governmental approvals by
 
failing to institute the agricultural work-study program and by
 renting the cabins to members of the general public." We are
 unable to discern, however, anywhere in the argument section of
 his opening brief where Wong offered any legal argument on the
 issue.
13 Therefore, the point is deemed waived pursuant to HRAP
 
28(b)(7).
 
4.	 If the Circuit Court erred in failing to award
Wong summary judgment on Count VI of the
Complaint, the error was harmless.
 
On May 21, 2007, the Circuit Court dismissed Count VI
 
of the Complaint. The dismissal functions as an adjudication on
 
the merits. See Haw. R. Civ. P. 41(b)(3) (unless otherwise
 
specified by the trial court, a dismissal is an adjudication on
 the merits unless it falls under HRCP 41(a) or is for lack of
 jurisdiction, improper venue, or failure to join a party). The
 Association has not appealed the dismissal. Wong has not argued
 that he has been harmed by this alleged error.
 Therefore, even if the Circuit Court erred by not
 
granting Wong's motion for partial summary judgment, such error
 would be harmless. See Takayama v. Zera, No. 27900, 2010 WL
 
973484, at *4 (Haw. Ct. App. Mar. 18, 2010) (holding that even if
 denial of summary judgment was erroneous, error was harmless
 because appellant prevailed at trial and did not allege any harm
 from denial of summary judgment). 
C.	 Attorneys' Fees and Costs
 Count I of the Complaint is the Association's central
 
claim and is, as Wong concedes, the "disputed main issue." 
13
 Although Wong recites facts relevant to its third point of error
and provides some commentary on those facts in its concise statement of the
case section of his opening brief, he failed to present a legal argument
attempting to demonstrate how the Circuit Court erred as a matter of law in
denying his motion for summary judgment based upon plaintiff's violation of
the Lease through its failure to comply with county and Land Use Commission
conditions. See Dixon v. Metro. Atlanta Rapid Transit Auth., 529 S.E.2d 398,
402 (Ga. Ct. App. 2000) (legal argument is, "at a minimum, a discussion of the
appropriate law as applied to the relevant facts"). Furthermore, Wong's
passing references to "land use documents" and Association representations
made to government entities in the argument section of his opening brief are
not offered to show that the Association violated terms of its governmental
approvals, but to establish the parties' intent with respect to the Lease.
 
19
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Thus, the Order Granting Fees and Costs and paragraph 4 of the
 
Amended Final Judgment awarding Wong attorneys' fees and costs is
 vacated.
 
V. CONCLUSION
 
The Amended Final Judgment is vacated in part and
 
affirmed in part. We vacate the portion of paragraph 1 of the
 
Amended Final Judgment that pertains to Count I of the Complaint
 and paragraph 4 in its entirety. We also vacate the Order
 Granting Fees and Costs. We affirm in all other respects. We
 remand for proceedings on Count I of the Complaint not
 inconsistent with this opinion.
