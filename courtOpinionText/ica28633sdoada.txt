STATE OF HAWAI rI, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
BERNARD K.B. YOUNG, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

 
(FC-CR. NO. 07-1-1034)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER

 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Bernard K.B. Young (Young) appeals
 
1
from a June 6, 2007 Family Court of the First Circuit  (family
court) judgment of conviction for Abuse of a Family or Household
 
member, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 709-906
 
(Supp. 2009).
 
Young argues on appeal (1) that there was insufficient

 
evidence to disprove his claim that he acted in self defense, (2)
 
that there was insufficient evidence that Young "physically
 
abused" the complainant, his nephew, or that he acted with the
 
requisite state of mind, and (3) that the family court abused its
 
discretion in admitting testimony about a previous altercation
 
between Young and the complainant.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI rI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant law, we conclude the following:
 
(1) The prosecution adduced sufficient evidence to 
disprove Young's self-defense claim. Young's brother, who is 
also the complainant's uncle, testified that Young grabbed him 
first and the complainant came over to help detain Young. Young 
testified that his brother grabbed him first. The complainant, 
however, testified that he pushed Young first. "[T]his court 
will not attempt to reconcile conflicting evidence, or interfere 
with a jury decision based on the credibility of witnesses or the 
weight of the evidence." State v. Yamada, 116 Hawai ri 422, 442, 
173 P.3d 569, 589 (App. 2007) (citation omitted). Based upon the verdict, the jury apparently believed Young's brother's version 
of events. Because "[s]ufficient evidence to support a 
conviction can be established through the testimony of a single 
witness[,]" there exists sufficient evidence to disprove Young's 
claim that he needed to use force to defend himself. Id. 
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). See also State 
v. Aki, 102 Hawai
ri 457, 464, 77 P.3d 948, 955 (App. 2003) 
(finding sufficient evidence for jury to reject justification defense where version of the incident most favorable to state 
showed defendant was aggressor). 
(2) The prosecution adduced sufficient evidence to
 
prove every element of the offense of Abuse of a Household or
 
Family Member.
 Abuse of a household or family member requires proof 
of "physical abuse." HRS § 709-906. Physical abuse requires 
maltreatment of someone "in such a manner as to cause injury, 
hurt, or damage to that person's body[.]" State v. Ornellas, 79 
Hawai
ri 418, 421, 903 P.2d 723, 726 (App. 1995). There was 
evidence adduced at trial that the complainant sustained 
"abrasions" or "abrasive scratches" on his back, arms, and leg 
during the altercation. Although the complaining witness could 
not pinpoint how he sustained the injuries, it is undisputed that 
the injuries were sustained during the scuffle. Sufficient 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI rI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
evidence supports the jury conclusion that Young caused that
 
scuffle that led to the complainant's injuries.
 
Young further argues that at most he acted negligently 
in causing the injuries, and therefore did not act with the state 
of mind required by the charge. We disagree. A jury may infer a 
defendant's state of mind from the circumstances surrounding his 
or her actions. State v. Eastman, 81 Hawai ri 131, 141, 913 P.2d 
57, 67 (1996). Witnesses testified that before being subdued and handcuffed, Young swung his arms at the complainant, tried to 
kick him, and pushed him against a wall. Furthermore, the 
complainant testified that Young tried to gouge his eyes. From 
this testimony, the jury could infer that the Young acted 
intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly in causing the 
complainant's injuries. Id. 
(3) The family court did not abuse its discretion in 
admitting evidence of a prior incident between Young and 
complaining witness. Although testimony regarding prior bad acts 
are usually inadmissable under Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) 
Rule 404(b) to prove "the character of a person in order to show 
action in conformity therewith," see State v. Pemberton, 71 
Hawai
ri 466, 471-72, 796 P.2d 80, 83 (1990), Rule 404(a)(1) 
allows the prosecution to introduce evidence of a pertinent character trait to rebut testimony of that character trait of the 
accused when offered by the accused. 
Here the family court admitted evidence of a prior
 
fight between Young and the complainant in 2001, for which Young
 
was arrested for abuse of a household or family member, after
 
Young claimed, in testifying in the present case, "I'm a lover,
 
not a fighter." Young objected on appeal that the prosecutor
 
elicited the statement by mischaracterizing Young's prior
 
testimony during direct examination, a tactic which he claims had
 
been disapproved of in United States v. Pantone, 609 F.2d 675
 
(3rd Cir. 1979). In Pantone, the Third Circuit rejected evidence
 
of the defendant's prior bad acts because it was offered to rebut
 
the defendant's testimony on cross-examination, saying that the
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI rI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
cross-examination went beyond the scope of direct examination, in
 
contravention of Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 611. Id. at 683­
84.
 
However, Young's general denial was not elicited by the
 
State's question at all, but was a non-responsive retort. 
Young's retort "I'm a lover, not a fighter" opened the door to
 
testimony regarding the prior incident between Young and the
 
complainant.
 
We disagree with Young's argument that evidence of the
 
2001 incident and arrest was not relevant or probative. A
 
defendant's character for peacefulness and non-violence is a
 
pertinent trait in an assault case. HRE Rule 404(a) cmt. See
 
also State v. Rabe, 5 Haw. App. 251, 263, 687 P.2d 554, 562
 (1984) ("[T]he prevailing view is that the word 'pertinent' as
 
used in Rule 404(a)(1) is generally synonymous with the word
 
'relevant', which is defined in Rule 401 as 'having any tendency
 
to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the
 
determination of the action more probable or less probable than
 
it would be without the evidence.'"). Evidence that a person had
 
been in a fight would tend to negate evidence that the person was
 
non-violent. State v. Moriwaki, 71 Haw. 347, 355, 791 P.2d 392,
 
396 (1990). As such, the testimony regarding the 2001 incident
 and subsequent arrest was relevant and probative of Young's claim
 
that he was "not a fighter."
 
Even after determining that evidence is admissible 
under Rule 404(a)(1), the court must inquire whether the 
evidence's "probative value is substantially outweighed by the 
danger of unfair prejudice." State v. Brooks, 123 Hawai ri 456, 
470, 235 P.3d 1168, 1182 (App. 2010) (quoting HRE Rule 403). Among the factors to be considered in this balancing test are: 

 the strength of the evidence as to the commission of the
other bad acts, the similarities between the [other] bad
acts [and the charged crime], the time that has elapsed
between the [other] bad acts [and the charged crime], the
need for the evidence, the efficacy of alternate proof, and
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI rI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
the degree to which the evidence will probably rouse the
jury to overmastering hostility.
 
Id. (quoting State v. Steger, 114 Hawai ri 162, 172, 158 P.3d 280, 
290 (App. 2006)). Here, the testimony shows a incident between 
the complainant and Young that had occurred six years earlier, 
where Young appeared to be the first aggressor. It was necessary 
because it was the only evidence offered to rebut Young's claim 
that he was "not a fighter." 
Although testimony regarding the prior incident was
 
unarguably prejudicial, "[t]he prejudicial effect of prior
 
bad-act evidence can be reduced or eliminated by proper jury
 
instructions." Id. at 471, 235 P.3d at 1183. The family court,
 
without objection, instructed the jury to evaluate the evidence
 of the prior incident "if at all[,] only to rebut the evidence of
 
peacefulness presented by the defendant during his testimony." A
 
jury is presumed to follow the court's instructions. Id. 
Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the court abused its
 discretion in admitting the testimony regarding the 2001
 
incident.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that June 6, 2007 judgment of
 
conviction entered in the Family Court of the First Circuit is
 affirmed.
