APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
In appeal no. 28664, Plaintiff-Appellant Joye C.
 
Romero, now known as Joye C. Hanabusa ("Joye"), appeals from the
 
June 22, 2007 Decision Granting in Part and Denying in Part
 Defendant's Motions for Relief Filed Herein on February 27, 2007
 and May 23, 2007 ("Decision") of the Family Court of the First
 Circuit ("Family Court") which granted the prospective portion
 and denied the retroactive portion of Defendant-Appellee Daniel
 L. Romero's ("Daniel") motions for post-decree relief.

1/
 The Decision granted Daniel's request to amend the formula used to
determine the allocation of Daniel's military pension incorporated in the
Qualified Domestic Relations Order ("QDRO"). Furthermore, the Decision denied
Daniel's request for the return of what was alleged to be a $13,063.35
overpayment pursuant to the unamended QDRO formula.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
appeal no. 28898, Daniel appeals from a subsequent November 9,
 
2
2007 Order ("Order") of the Family Court  that awarded Joye
$22,320 as reimbursement for payments that she made on the
 
parties' mortgage pursuant to an agreement between the parties. 
The appeals were consolidated under appeal no. 28664 by order of
 this court on October 31, 2011. 
On appeal, Joye contends that the Family Court erred 
in: (1) granting (in part) Daniel's May 23, 2007 Post-Decree Motion for Relief because the motion was untimely filed under Hawai
'i Family Court Rules ("HFCR") Rule 60(b); and (2) taking 
judicial notice of Exhibits CC, EE, FF and GG attached to Daniel's May 23, 2007 Post-Decree Motion for Relief because the attachments contained disputed adjudicative facts not otherwise established through testimony. Daniel contends that the Family Court erred in: (3) finding that an agreement existed between Daniel and Joye that (a) allowed Joye to make the payments on the second mortgage without relieving Daniel of the debts associated with the parties' marital residence (the "Property"), (b) awarded Joye full ownership of the Property, and (c) required Daniel to sign a quitclaim deed without relief from debt obligations; and (4) finding that Daniel filed his motion to compel the sale of
 the Property in response to Joye's motion for reimbursement. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 affirm the Decision and the Order and resolve the parties' points

of error as follows.
 
We begin by addressing Joye's points of error:
 
(1) Joye and Daniel were divorced upon entry of the
 
Decree Granting Divorce and Awarding Child Custody, filed
 April 4, 2000 ("Decree"). 
The Decree provided that the parties
 
were to submit any QDRO(s) necessary to effectuate the
 distribution of the parties' pension benefits pursuant to the
 formula recognized in Linson v. Linson, 1 Haw. App. 272, 618 P.2d
 748 (1980). On May 13, 2002, the Family Court entered a QDRO in
 substantially the same form as it was submitted by Joye to divide
 Daniel's military pension benefit. Paragraph 6.b of the May 13,
 2002 QDRO states that "[t]he Service Member has served in the
 United States Armed Forces since August 14, 1972, with a service
 period of twenty-four (24) years overlapping marriage, during
 which time the Service Member performed creditable military
 service in the United States Air Force." Furthermore, although
 the QDRO purported to reflect the stipulation of the parties,
 Daniel's signature was not included on the document.
 
Daniel's February 27, 2007 Post-Decree Motion for
 
Relief sought to modify the May 13, 2002 QDRO. The motion,
 brought pursuant to HFCR Rule 7, referred to information received
 by Daniel from the Department of the Air Force in a letter dated
 June 14, 2005 ("June 14, 2005 Letter") that explained, among
 other things, that during the period that Joye and Daniel were
 married, Daniel had completed just over eighteen years of active
 service. That information conflicted with the statement in
 paragraph 6.b of the QDRO.
 
Joye objected, contending that Rule 7 motions were
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
 
"intended to enforce compliance with existing Orders," or "to
 
subsequently modify ongoing Orders . . . when, due to 'material
 changes in circumstances,' compliance is no longer feasible." 
The Family Court appears to have agreed with Joye, ordering
 Daniel to "file a Rule 60(b) motion or a motion pursuant to any
 other legal authority." On May 23, 2007, Daniel renewed his
 motion under HFCR Rule 60.

In its Decision, the Family Court held that the May 13,
 
2002 QDRO "is based upon an inaccurate [Linson] formula which
 misstates the length of the marriage and months of service
 creditable for retirement." Furthermore, the Family Court held
 that the QDRO "inaccurately states . . . that 'the parties have
 stipulated that the court shall enter this order[.]'" Joye does
 not contest the merits of Daniel's claim, but contends that
 Daniel's motion to correct the formula was untimely under HFCR
 Rule 60(b) because it was filed approximately twenty months after
 Daniel received the June 14, 2005 Letter.
 
The re-casting of Daniel's motion under Rule 60(b) does
 
not determine its legitimacy. "[I]t is the substance of the
 pleading that controls, not its nomenclature." Anderson v.
 
Oceanic Props., 3 Haw. App. 350, 355, 650 P.2d 612, 617 (1982)
 (citation omitted). The QDRO itself envisions an amendment
 process to be initiated in the form of an enforcement proceeding,
 providing that any amended order "shall be deemed to be in the
 
3/
 In his memorandum in support of his May 23, 2007 Post-Decree
Motion for Relief, Daniel contends that the correct amount of credible service
time (overlapping marriage and service time) was 217 months rather than 288
months (24 years x 12 months) as calculated using the information contained in
Paragraph 6.b of the QDRO. 
4
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
nature of enforcement proceedings."4
 
We previously observed that the QDRO here is "merely a
 
collateral enforcement device that will implement the substantive
 
rulings that are already within the [Decision]." Romero v.
 
Romero, No. 28664, 2007 WL 4329492, at *3 (Hawai' i Ct. App. 
Dec. 12, 2007) (Order). Furthermore, the QDRO explicitly states
 that the Family Court retains continuing jurisdiction over the
 service member's military retired/retainer pay "for so long as
 the parties both are alive." The Family Court retained the
 authority to make "every just and equitable order not
 inconsistent with the other provisions herein[.]" As a result,
 Daniel's motion was properly brought as a motion to enforce under
 HFCR Rule 7. See Torres v. Torres, 100 Hawai' i 397, 60 P.3d 798 
(2002).
 
By its terms, the QDRO is not necessarily the final
 
division of the qualifying party's retirement benefits. 
Therefore, the general policy that judgments be final does not
 have the same weight as it relates to QDRO as it does in other
 
4/
 Paragraph 17 of the QDRO provides that: 
The Family Court of the First Circuit shall retain
jurisdiction over all of the matters as described in this
section so as to ensure the full completion of, and
compliance with, the provisions of this agreement, ongoing
for so long as the parties both shall live. This shall
include retention of personal jurisdiction over both the
parties hereto as well as retention of ongoing subject
matter jurisdiction over the retirement plans, and both the
parties hereto irrevocably consent to the same. This shall
specifically include but not be limited to making any
amendments to the provisions contained herein which may be
required by the administrators of the Retirement Plan(s)
described herein as a prerequisite to commencing payment of
benefits due Alternate Payee. Any such amended orders shall
be deemed to be in the nature of enforcement proceedings as
opposed to subsequent property division. The Court shall
also have the authority to make every just and equitable
order not inconsistent with the other provisions herein, and
not inconsistent with any other applicable law.

cases. 
The Family Court's determination that it is "just and 
equitable to allow [Daniel] an opportunity to correct the Linson 
formula for future retirement payments" is not inconsistent with any of the other provisions of the QDRO. In sum, Joye has not met her burden of establishing that the Family Court abused its discretion in amending the Decree, and the language of the Decree does not prohibit the Family Court from doing so. See Torres, 
100 Hawai' i at 410, 60 P.3d at 811. 
(2) Joye contends that the Family Court erred in
 
taking judicial notice of Exhibits CC, EE, FF, and GG to Daniel's
 May 23, 2007 Post-Decree Motion for Relief. As evidence, Joye
 points to the fact that the Family Court "took judicial notice of
 all pleadings previously filed in the case, and their
 attachments[.]" From that, Joye contends that the court
 "apparently utilized these documents to arrive at its result." 
Joye's argument does not address whether the Court took
 
judicial notice of the truth of the facts asserted in the
 documents:
 
A distinction must be carefully drawn between taking
judicial notice of the existence of documents in the Court
 file as opposed to the truth of the facts asserted in those
 
documents. . . .
 
. . . [W]hile a Court may take judicial notice of each
document in the Court's file[,] it may only take judicial
notice of the truth of facts asserted in documents such as
 orders, judgments and findings of fact and conclusions of
law because of the principles of collateral estoppel, res
judicata, and the law of the case.
 
State v. Kotis, 91 Hawai' i 319, 342, 984 P.2d 78, 101 (1999) 
(quoting Gottsch v. Bank of Stapleton, 458 N.W.2d 443, 455–56 
(Neb. 1990)). The Family Court here did not purport to take judicial notice of the truth of facts asserted in the documents. 
6
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
 
At the hearing, Joye testified that in 2005 she
 
received a copy of Exhibit EE to Daniel's May 23, 2007 Post-
Decree Motion for Relief (the June 14, 2005 Letter), forwarded by
 her attorney, which she said stated that she was entitled to only
 thirty-eight percent of Daniel's disposable retirement benefits. 
When Daniel sought to introduce the exhibit into evidence, Joye's
 counsel objected. The court sustained the objection noting that
 "[t]he Court will not allow this exhibit to come in because the
 proper foundation has not been laid. However, the Court will
 receive [Joye's] testimony that she did get this document." The
 Family Court subsequently explained that it was not considering
 the substantive truth of the attachments because the attachments
 were not entered into evidence. 
Joye ignores the Family Court's explanation and
 
contends instead that the court took judicial notice of "highly
 disputed adjudicative facts[.]" From that, Joye contends,
 without any explanation, that the court's action "worked a severe
 prejudice to her interests."
 
Joye offers no evidence and makes no argument that the
 
Family Court relied upon the contents of the attachments in
 coming to its decision. Therefore, the Family Court's decision
 to take judicial notice of the documents was not an abuse of
 discretion, where the court only took judicial notice of the
 existence of Exhibits CC, EE, FF, and GG, not the veracity of
 their contents.
 
We proceed to address Daniel's points of error:
 (3) Daniel contends that the Family Court erred in
 
recognizing an August 2002 agreement between the parties and its
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
 
terms in favor of Joye while ignoring the same terms in his
 
favor. 
Daniel does not contest the court's finding that
 
"[t]here is no dispute that in or about August of 2002 [the
 parties] entered into an agreement between themselves whereby
 Joye agreed to pay Daniel's portion of the debt service for the
 [Property] (i.e. the second mortgage); in return for which,
 Daniel agreed to relinquish, and convey all of his right, title,
 and interest in the premises to Joye." Furthermore, Daniel does
 not contest the finding that "[i]t is further undisputed that
 pursuant to the agreement, Joye made all of the payments on the
 second mortgage for approximately 4 years, and 5 months, i.e.
 from August of 2002 through March 27, 2007 and beyond." Rather,
 Daniel contends that the agreement was unfair without further
 amendment (requiring that Joye refinance the Property) and that
 he was justified in breaching it until and unless Joye agreed to
 amend it. 
Daniel has demonstrated no entitlement to amend the 
agreement. "Findings of fact that are unchallenged on appeal are the operative facts of a case." Robert's Haw. Sch. Bus, Inc. v. 
Laupahoehoe Transp. Co., 91 Hawai' i 224, 239, 982 P.2d 853, 868 
(1999), superseded by statute on other grounds as recognized in Haw. Med. Ass'n v. Haw. Med. Serv. Ass'n, 113 Hawai' i 77, 107, 
148 P.3d 1179, 1209 (2006). As such, the Family Court did not abuse its discretion in granting Joye's motion for post-decree relief. 
In addition, to the extent that Daniel contends that
 
the Family Court erred in accepting Joye's testimony concerning
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
 
the August 2002 agreement over his own, we do not reconcile 
conflicting testimony. "The appellate court will neither reconcile conflicting evidence nor interfere with the decision of the trier of fact based on the witnesses' credibility or the weight of the evidence." Onaka v. Onaka, 112 Hawai' i 374, 384, 
146 P.3d 89, 99 (2006) (quoting State v. Mitchell, 94 Hawai' i 
388, 393, 15 P.3d 314, 319 (App. 2000)). 
(4) Even if we consider the Family Court's
 
characterization of Daniel's motion as being "in response to"
 Joye's motion to be a finding of fact by the Family Court,
 erroneous findings of fact that are "unnecessary to support the
 decision and judgment of the trial court are not grounds for
 reversal." Wright v. Wright, 1 Haw. App. 581, 584, 623 P.2d 97,
 
100 (1981).
 
Therefore, the Family Court's June 22, 2007 Decision
 
Granting in Part and Denying in Part Defendant's Motions for
 Relief Filed Herein on February 27, 2007 and May 23, 2007, and
 the November 9, 2007 Order are affirmed.
