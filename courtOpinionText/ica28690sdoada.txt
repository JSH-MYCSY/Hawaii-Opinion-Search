JEFFREY SMITH AND LAUREL SMITH, Plaintiffs-Appellees, v.
HEINZ-GUENTHER PINK, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
HONOLULU DIVISION
(CIVIL CASE NO. 1RC07-1-711)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Heinz-Guenther Pink ( Pink) appeals
from the Second Amended Judgment ( Judgment) filed on October 30,
2007 in the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu
Division ( District Court) .1  In the Judgment, the District Court
awarded compensatory and treble damages in the total amount of
$13,050.24, and attorney's fees and costs in the amount of
$8,326.62, in favor of Plaintiffs-Appellees Jeffrey Smith and
Laurel Smith ( Smiths) and against Pink. 
Pink, who is self-represented, did not include a points
of error section in his Opening Brief as required by Hawai# i
Rules of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4).  Moreover,
Pink's Opening Brief does not comply in any significant respect
with HRAP Rule 28.  Pink's non-compliance also includes:  (1)
failure to provide subject matter index or a table of
authorities, in violation of HRAP Rule 28(b)(1); (2) failure to
provide a concise statement of the case, in violation of HRAP
Rule 28(b)(3); (3) failure to refer to the specific errors
alleged pointing out in the record where the alleged errors
occurred and where they were brought to the attention of the
District Court, in violation of HRAP Rule 28(b)(4); (4) failureNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2to provide a standards of review section, in violation of HRAP
Rule 28(b)(5); and (5) failure to include a statement of related
cases, in violation of HRAP Rule 28(b)(11).  
Pink fails to make a discernable argument regarding the
District Court's findings of fact, which were entered after a
trial on the merits.  See HRAP Rule 28(b)(7) ("[T]he appellant
shall file an opening brief, containing the following sections 
. . . (7) The argument, containing the contentions of the
appellant on the points presented and the reasons therefor, with
citations to the authorities, statutes and parts of the record
relied on. . . . Points not argued may be deemed waived.");
Hawaii Ventures, LLC v. Otaka, Inc., 114 Hawai #i 438, 478, 164
P.3d 696, 736 (2007) ("[A]n appellate court is not obliged to
address matters for which the appellant has failed to present
discernible arguments.")  To the extent that Pink has challenged
the District Court's findings of fact, he has not met his burden
of demonstrating that they are clearly erroneous. 
Nevertheless, in light of the policy favoring
dispositions on the merits, we notice plain error in certain of
the District Court's conclusions of law.  The District Court
concluded, inter alia , that the Smiths were "consumers" within
the meaning of Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 480-2(d).  In
Cieri v. Leticia Query Realty, Inc., 80 Hawai #i 54, 66, 905 P.2d
29, 41 (1995), however, the Hawaii Supreme Court held:
[R]eal estate or residences do not qualify as "goods" under
HRS § 480-1, and the [Plaintiffs] therefore do not have
standing as "consumers" to bring a claim alleging a
violation of HRS chapter 480 for the real estate transaction
at issue in the present case as purchasers of "goods."
The dispute in this case arose out of the rental of
Pink's real property to the Smiths, which involved the transfer
of a possessory interest in the real property for a period of
time, in exchange for payment.  Smiths were not purchasers of
goods or services from Pink and nor was the lease at issue a
"personal investment," as alternatively contemplated by HRS NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 See Akinaka v. Disciplinary Bd. of Hawai‘i Supreme Court, 912
Hawai#i 51, 55, 979 P.2d 1077, 1081 (1999) (holding that "although neither the
parties nor the trial court considered the question of standing, this court
has a duty, sua sponte," to determine whether the plaintiff has standing
(citations omitted)).
3§ 480-1.  Therefore, the Smiths had no standing to bring a suit
under HRS § 480-2 and were not entitled to treble damages.2
For these reasons, we affirm the District Court's award
of compensatory damages in favor of the Smith's and against Pink
in the amount of $4,350.08, but vacate the award of treble
damages.  As it appears that the attorney's fees were awarded
based on HRS § 480-13(a)(1), we also vacate the attorney's fees
awarded in the Judgment and remand for recalculation pursuant to
the proper statutory authority.  In all other respects, we
affirm.
Accordingly, the District Court's October 30, 2007
Judgment is affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded for
further proceedings consistent with this Summary Disposition
Order.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, April 15, 2010.
