APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D NO. 05-1-0159)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant/Cross-Appellee Arlene
 
Glowania-Larimer (Wife) appeals from the July 16, 2007 judgment
 
of the Family Court of the Second Circuit (family court)1
 
granting her divorce from Defendant-Appellee/Cross-Appellant
 Joseph W. Larimer (Husband). Wife also appeals from the family
 
court's dismissal with prejudice of Wife's third-party Complaint
 
Against Indispensable Party Louie Van Larimer (Father). Husband
 
cross-appeals from the family court's judgment granting divorce.
 
Background
 
Husband and Wife became romantically involved beginning
 
in 1981. Their daughter was born on January 11, 1992. In August 
1992, Husband and Father acquired a property in Haiku, Maui
 
(Haiku property) as joint tenants and were jointly responsible
 
for the mortgage. Husband and Wife were married approximately
 
three months later in November 1992. Wife's name was never added

to the title as an owner of the Haiku property. On April 8,
 
2005, Wife initiated divorce proceedings and, in May 2005, moved
 
with the daughter to Nevada. Wife failed to move forward with
 
the divorce and, consequently, the family court entered a Notice
 
and Order of Dismissal for Want of Prosecution of Wife's second
 
complaint for divorce on May 25, 2006. Husband claims he sold
 
his interest in the Haiku property to Father in July 2005 for
 
$20,000 after visiting Wife in Nevada and informing her of his
 
intent to sell the Haiku property. Husband and Wife filed a
 
joint tax return acknowledging the $20,000 Haiku property sale in
 
April 2006.
 
On June 14, 2006, Wife filed a motion to reinstate her
 
divorce complaint. Wife alleged that she was entitled to
 
$285,439 as her one-half share of the Haiku property's estimated
 
value. Upon Wife's June 16, 2006 motion, the family court
 
entered an order enjoining and restraining Husband from disposing
 
any of his real or personal property except as necessary until
 
further order of the court.
 
On June 29, 2006, Husband signed and delivered a
 
quitclaim deed of real property to Father, as grantee, conveying
 
the Haiku property to Father in exchange for $10 consideration. 
This deed was executed without the knowledge or consent of Wife. 
On July 6, 2006, Husband filed his responsive Position Statement
 
contending that the former marital residence was now the property
 
of Father. Additionally, Husband contended that Wife was
 
entitled to $10,000, half of the proceeds of the July 2005
 
$20,000 sale of Husband's interest to Father. On December 14,
 
2006, Wife filed a complaint against Father as an indispensable
 
party, alleging that Father was an "accommodation party" for the
 
original purchase of the Haiku property.
 
Following hearings, the family court found that the
 
parties had no interest in any real property and thus issued no
 
order on this matter. The family court granted the divorce and
 
awarded alimony to Wife in the amount of $850 per month until
 
December 2022 and awarded child support to Wife in the amount of
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
$630 per month as provided by the then-controlling 2004 Hawaif i 
Child Support Guidelines. The family court dismissed Wife's 
third-party complaint against Father, ruling that Wife failed to 
raise "any of the issues set forth in her Complaint Against 
Indispensable Party" and "failed to present any witness testimony 
or any other evidence to prove any of the allegations set forth 
in her Complaint Against Indispensable Party" with regard to 
Father. 
On appeal, Wife argues (1) that the Haiku property is 
marital property subject to division and she is thus entitled to 
one-half of Husband's interest in the property and (2) that the 
family court erred in dismissing her complaint against Father as 
an indispensable party. Husband, in his cross-appeal, argues 
that (1) the family court erred in reaching its alimony award and 
(2) erred in its child support calculations.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve the parties' points of error as follows:
 
(1) As a preliminary matter, Wife's briefs do not 
adhere to Hawaif i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
requirements on several grounds. First, Wife has failed to serve Father or his counsel, as required under HRAP Rule 25(b). 
Additionally, Wife has failed to include with her Opening Brief 
copies of the lower court judgment, the order dismissing her 
complaint against Father, and the findings of fact and 
conclusions of law, as required under HRAP Rule 28(b)(3) ("There 
shall be appended to the brief a copy of the judgment, decree, 
findings of fact and conclusions of law, order, opinion or 
decision relevant to any point on appeal, unless otherwise 
ordered by the court"). While this court could affirm the family 
court's judgment on this basis alone, in light of Hawaif i 
appellate court's policy of deciding cases on the merits where possible, we consider Wife's points on the merits. See Hous. 
Fin. & Dev. Corp. v. Ferguson, 91 Hawaif i 81, 85-86, 979 P.2d 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
1107, 1111-12 (1999). We caution that the future violation of
 
court rules may result in sanctions.
 
(2) The family court's determination, that Wife failed 
to present sufficient evidence that Husband transferred property 
in violation of the family court's pre-decree order, is supported 
by our review of the record. Because the family court did not 
err in determining that Husband did not own real property at the 
time of the hearing, it was correct in ruling that there was no 
real property in the marital estate subject to division. See 
Schiller v. Schiller, 120 Hawaif i 283, 308, 205 P.3d 548, 573 
(App. 2009) (stating that a court cannot divide property the 
parties do not own at the time of its decree). 
(3) The family court did not err in dismissing Wife's 
complaint against Father as an indispensable party. "As a 
general rule, if a party does not raise an argument at trial, 
that argument will be deemed to have been waived on appeal; this 
rule applies in both criminal and civil cases." State v. Moses, 
102 Hawaif i 449, 456, 77 P.3d 940, 947 (2003). The lower court 
found that Wife "rested her case at trial: 1) without raising any 
of the issues set forth in her Complaint Against Indispensable 
Party; and 2) having further failed to present any witness 
testimony or any other evidence to prove any of the allegations 
set forth in her Complaint Against Indispensable Party . . . ." 
Although Wife challenges these findings in her points on appeal, 
her failure to present argument in support constitutes a waiver. 
HRAP Rules 28(b)(7) and 30. See also Hawaii Ventures, LLC v. 
Otaka, Inc., 114 Hawaif i 438, 478-79, 164 P.3d 696, 736-37 
(2007). 
(4) Husband claims that the family court clearly erred
 
in calculating his gross monthly income as $6,163 and that the
 
only evidence as to his most recent gross income indicated a
 
$5,916.67 per month figure. Husband stated his gross monthly
 
income as $6,163 in both his June 5, 2007 Proposed Judgment and
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
his August 27, 2007 Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of
 
Law. The family court did not err in calculating Husband's gross
 
monthly income.
 
(5) Husband argues that the family court abused its
 
discretion in awarding alimony retroactively from August 2006. 
Specifically, he claims that the family court, in its FOF No. 42,
 
stated that it was appropriate to award Wife alimony for a period
 
of 15 years, but that the judgment awards alimony for a period of
 
over 17 years given the retroactive application. Contrary to
 
Husband's representations, the family court did not, in
 
articulating "a period of 15 years" for alimony, state that this
 
period meant 15 years total. Regardless, Husband offers no
 
authority or other argument demonstrating how the retroactive
 
alimony award constitutes an abuse of discretion.
 
(6) There is nothing in the record to suggest that the 
family court relied on evidence of spousal abuse in calculating 
alimony, or in any other aspect of its judgment. While the 
family court allowed testimony regarding abuse to be admitted 
based on Wife's attorney's proffer that the evidence was relevant 
to the issue of alimony, the family court made no finding that 
abuse had occurred nor did it state this evidence was considered 
in making its alimony award. A Court is presumed to disregard 
incompetent evidence. In re Doe, 107 Hawaif i 439, 450, 114 P.3d 
945, 956 (App. 2005). 
(7) Husband contends that the family court improperly 
calculated child support by neglecting to account for his alimony payments. Husband is correct that, in calculating child support 
under the Child Support Guidelines, spousal support obligations 
must be subtracted from the paying parent's monthly income and 
added to the recipient parent's monthly income. See Hawaif i 
State Judiciary, Instructions for the 2004 Child Support Guidelines 5 (2004), http://www.state.hi.us/jud/Oahu/Family/

Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the judgment entered on
 
July 16, 2007 by the Family Court for the Second Circuit is
 vacated with regard to the child support award and remanded to
 
the family court to recalculate Husband's child support
 
obligations in accordance with the 2004 Child Support Guidelines. 
In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.
