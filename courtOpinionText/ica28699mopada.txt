IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT AGENCY, STATE OF HAWAI 'I,
Plaintiff, v. PT, Defendant-Appellant, v. EM,
(now known as ED), Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-P NO. 98-1170)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant PT appeals from an April 20, 2007
 
post-judgment order (Order) of the Family Court of the First
 
1
Circuit (family court),  granting Defendant-Appellee EM's (now
known as ED) Motion and Affidavit for Relief After Order or
 
Decree regarding child support.
 
BACKGROUND
 
On November 20, 1998, Plaintiff-Appellee Child Support 
Enforcement Agency, State of Hawai 'i (CSEA) filed a Complaint for 
Establishment of Paternity on behalf of child SM. On March 23, 
1999, the family court entered a judgment, which among other 
things, adjudicated PT as the father of SM and awarded joint 
legal custody to PT and EM, physical custody of SM to EM, and 
reasonable visitation to PT. Pertinent to this appeal, the

family court  found that exceptional circumstances warranted
deviation from the Child Support Guidelines because "Obligor
 
[PT's] total monthly child support obligation is greater than 70%
 
of Obligor's available income for primary support, therefore
 
child support is assessed at 70% of Obligor's available income
 
and divided between [PT's] three children." As a result of this
 
finding, the family court ordered PT to pay $420 per month in
 
child support.
 
On November 3, 2006, EM filed her Motion and Affidavit
 
for Relief After Order or Decree (Motion), asking that the
 
March 23, 1999 Judgment be modified to increase the child support
 
payment from $420 to $950 per month.3 EM based this request on
 
her averments that PT had enjoyed an increase in income since the
 1999 order and that PT received a monthly payment from a trust
 
and was anticipating a "large lump-sum payout" from this trust. 
EM also submitted a Child Support Guidelines Worksheet, which was
 
admitted into evidence as Exhibit A, EM's 2005 tax return, which
 
was admitted into evidence as Exhibit D, and a Financial
 
Information Sheet in support of her request.
 
At the December 28, 2006 hearing on EM's Motion, both
 
EM and PT testified. EM also offered Exhibits B and C, "copies
 
of the payroll records we received from Matson," PT's employer. 
EM's counsel explained that these documents were portions of
 
documents she received directly from Matson pursuant to a
 
subpoena she had issued. PT objected, citing a "lack of
 
foundation." The family court reserved ruling at this juncture. 
During cross-examination of PT, EM's counsel again
 
sought to introduce Exhibits B and C.

 EM also asked for an increase in payments on child support in

Q. Could you please look at Exhibit B? So what it says
there -- maybe the 4th -- it's the fifth line down, 1, 2, 3,
4, 5 -- new hire, it says 6/05/2006, you would agree that's
correct information from Matson?
 
A. Yes.
 
Q. And it does say your name, [PT] is up on top?
 
A. Yes.
 
Q. Okay. So you would agree that Exhibit B is correct in
terms of your hire date?
 A. Yes.
 
Q. And sir, could you please look at Exhibit C?
 
A. Okay.
 
Q. Would you agree that on the payroll record on Exhibit
C, each of those pay statements has the name [PT} -- where
it says –­
A. Yes.
 
Q. Is that your employee ID number?
 
A. That's my Social Security number.
 
Q. Okay. So do you agree that these appear to be fair
and accurate records on you?
 
. . . .
 
A. I see my name there, but I have no verification on
numbers. I just haven't looked at that closely.
 
. . . .
 
Q. So could you please take a minute and look at those
and let me know if you think those are fair and accurate
reportings of your income.
 
. . . .
 
A. I cannot answer that.
 
In support of admission of Exhibits B and C, EM's counsel argued,
 
based on the procedures and protocols in Family Court, you
have the subpoena from Matson in the file. I have here
 records with [PT's] name -- and the fact that he's
identified Exhibit B as being correct representation of the
start date. We could submit that as B and C. There is
 enough evidence for the Court, in light of the subpoena in
the record, the records with his name, and what he admitted
to be a Social Security number, and he's already
acknowledged the authenticity and correctness of Exhibit B,
we would admit B and C into evidence.

Nevertheless, the family court did not rule on the admissibility
 
of Exhibits B and C, ordering instead that the parties submit
 
written closing arguments in which they would also address
 
admission of these exhibits.
 
The parties filed their written closing arguments and,
 
on April 20, 2007, the family court entered its Order, awarding
 
child support in the amount of $950 per month. The family court
 
did not file any findings of fact or conclusions of law in
 
support of the Order nor did it rule on the admissibility of
 
Exhibits B and C in the Order. 
PT filed for reconsideration, which was denied on
 
July 25, 2007. This timely appeal followed.
 
On appeal, PT challenges the Order on three grounds.4
 
He argues that the family court erred when it did not abide by
 
the terms of original judgment wherein extraordinary
 
circumstances based on his support of two other children were
 
found, reducing his child support obligation from that calculated
 
under the Child Support Guidelines. Second, he maintains that
 
because Wong v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 66 Haw. 389, 665 P.2d
 
157 (1983), requires "cogent reasons" before deviation from the
 
original judgment could be ordered, the failure to issue findings
 
of fact and conclusions of law disclosing those reasons was an
 
abuse of the family court's discretion. Finally, PT reasons
 
that, as the family court did not accept Exhibits B and C into
 
evidence, there was no evidence upon which to base the
 
calculation of the child support award. EM did not file an
 
answering brief.

 We note that PT's points on appeal do not comply with Hawai' i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4). "[F]ailure to comply with
HRAP [Rule] 28(b)(4) is alone sufficient to affirm the judgment of the circuitcourt." O'Connor v. Diocese of Honolulu, 77 Hawai' i 383, 385, 885 P.2d 361,
363 (1994); Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai' i 225, 228, 909 P.2d 553, 556
(1995); City & Cnty. of Honolulu v. Kailua Auto Wreckers, Inc., 66 Haw. 532,533, 668 P.2d 34, 35 (1983). However, "the policies of this court are topermit litigants to appeal and to have their cases heard on the merits, wherepossible." O'Connor, 77 Hawai' i at 386, 885 P.2d at 364. Counsel is warned 
that future violations of the rules may result in sanctions. HRAP Rule 51.

DISCUSSION
 
EM's Motion was authorized by Hawaii Revised Statutes
 
(HRS) §§ 584-15(e) and 576D-7(e) (2006).5 At the hearing on EM's
 
6
Motion, the 2004 Child Support Guidelines  were in effect.  See
 
HRS § 576D-7(d). Courts are required to use the Child Support
 
Guidelines established by HRS § 576D-7, "except when exceptional
 
circumstances warrant departure." HRS § 571-52.5 (2006). 
The court's application of HRS § 584-15(d) is reviewed for
abuse of discretion. Cf. Nabarrete [v. Nabarrete], 86 
Hawai'i [368,] 372, 949 P.2d [208,] 212 [(App. 1997)]
("Since no rules or guidelines have been published advisingthe family court how to decide [a certain child supportissue], the relevant appellate standard of review is theabuse of discretion standard."). An abuse of discretion occurs if the trial court has "clearly exceeded the boundsof reason or disregarded rules or principles of law orpractice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant."Amfac, Inc. v. Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co., 74 Haw. 85,114, 839 P.2d 10, 26 (1992) (citation omitted). 
Child Support Enforcement Agency v. Doe, 98 Hawai 'i 58, 64, 41 
P.3d 720, 726 (App. 2001) (some brackets added). EM bore the

 These statutes provided then, as they do now,
 
[576D-7](e) The responsible or custodial parent for
which child support has previously been ordered shall have a
right to petition the family court or the child support
enforcement agency not more than once every three years for
review and adjustment of the child support order without
having to show a change in circumstances. The responsible
or custodial parent shall not be precluded from petitioning
the family court or the child support enforcement agency for
review and adjustment of the child support order more than
once in any three-year period if the second or subsequent
request is supported by proof of a substantial or material
change in circumstances.
 
[§584-15] (e) In determining the amount to be paid by
a parent for support of the child and the period during
which the duty of support is owed, a court enforcing the
obligation of support shall use the guidelines established
under section 576D-7. Provision may be made for the
support, maintenance, and education of an adult or minor
child and an incompetent adult child, whether or not the
petition is made before or after the child has attained the
age of majority.
 
The record shows no other petition for review of the support order within the
three years immediately preceding EM's Motion.

burden of proof as the moving party. See id., citing Ho v. 
Leftwich, 88 Hawai 'i 251, 257, 965 P.2d 793, 799 (1998) (the 
plaintiff "must bear the burden of proving all of the elements of 
her case"). 
PT's first two points are closely related. He asserts
 
that the family court was bound by the terms of the March 23,
 
1999 Judgment, in which it was determined that "extraordinary
 
circumstances" warranted deviation from the amount he would have
 
paid in child support as calculated under the Child Support
 
Guidelines unless "cogent reasons" justifying the change were
 
found. However, PT provides no authority for the proposition
 
that concepts of comity or law of the case apply in a post-
judgment modification of child support situation. 
Rather, under the statutory framework, a custodial 
parent is entitled to a review of the child support calculations 
without having to show a change in circumstances, once every 
three years. HRS § 576D-7(e). Whether "exceptional 
circumstances" exist warranting a deviation from the child 
support guidelines is a question of law. Child Support 
Enforcement Agency v. Doe, 104 Hawai 'i 449, 455, 91 P.3d 1092, 
1098 (App. 2004). While it is true that whether to grant a 
deviation from the Child Support Guidelines is a matter of 
discretion, id., the statutory framework is designed to 
periodically revisit the support calculation and the family court 
was asked to reevaluate the child support award in light of 
circumstances in existence at the time of the Motion. 
PT's third point, however, has merit. EM asked that
 
PT's child support obligation be increased from $420 to $950
 
because PT "has recently commenced employment at Matson Terminals
 
where he is currently earning approximately $91,000 per year" and
 
argued that PT's trust income should be taken into account. To
 
that end, EM offered Exhibits B and C which purported to be
 
employment documents attesting to PT's start-of-employment date
 
with Matson and his salary. However, there is no indication in
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the record that the family court ever accepted these exhibits
 
into evidence. 
PT testified that the June 5, 2006 start date with
 
Matson reflected on Exhibit B was correct and also testified that
 
he worked overtime an average of eighteen to twenty hours per
 
week. However, PT did not testify to the amount he was paid and
 
there was no other evidence supporting EM's allegation that he
 
earned $91,000, or any other amount, from this employment. 
Trust income is also included in calculating a parent's 
income for child support purposes. See 2004 Guidelines 
https://ku.ehawaii.gov/juddocs/page_server/SelfHelp/Forms/Oahu/7D 004AF15FE5ADBDEEA9E49E98.html (last accessed June 23, 2011) 
reprinted in 1 Hawaii State Bar Association, 2005 Hawai
'i Divorce 
Manual, § 4, App. 3 (7th ed. 2005). PT acknowledged that he received anywhere between $180 and $500 per month from a trust 
and that the trust was scheduled to be dissolved in September, 
presumably of the next year, 2007, but he testified that he had 
"no idea" what amount he would receive from the trust's 
dissolution. 
As there was insufficient evidence presented
 
establishing an increase in PT's income, the family court abused
 
its discretion when it granted EM's motion increasing the child
 
support to be paid by PT.
 
Therefore, the Family Court of the First Circuit's
 
April 20, 2007 Order is vacated, and the matter is remanded for a
 
ruling on the admissibility of Exhibits B and C and calculation
 
of the amount of child support based on the evidence admitted.
