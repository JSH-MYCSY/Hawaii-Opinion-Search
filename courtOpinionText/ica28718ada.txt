violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-62 (2007).1
 
1 At the time relevant to this case, HRS § 291E-62 (2007)
provided:
 
§ 291E-62 Operating a vehicle after license and

HRS § 291E-62 provides for enhanced penalties for repeat
 
offenders who have prior OVLPSR-OVUII convictions within five
 years of the charged offense.
2 Bryan had two prior qualifying
 
OVLPSR-OVUII convictions which were not alleged in the complaints
 charging her with the instant OVLPSR-OVUII offenses. Bryan
 pleaded no contest to and was convicted of the instant OVLPSR­OVUII charges. Prior to sentencing, Bryan argued that she should
 be sentenced as a first-time OVLPSR-OVUII offender because
 Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai
'i (State) had not alleged the 
prior OVLPSR-OVUII convictions in the complaints. The Circuit
 Court of the First Circuit (circuit court) rejected Bryan's
 
1(...continued)
(A) Thirty days imprisonment;
 
(B) A $1,000 fine; and
 
(C) Revocation of license and privilege to
operate a vehicle for an additional two
years; and
 
(3) For an offense that occurs within five years
of two or more prior convictions for offenses
under this section or under section 291-4.5
 as that section was in effect on December 31,
2001:
 
(A) One year imprisonment;
 
(B) A $2,000 fine; and
 
(C) Permanent revocation of the person's
license and privilege to operate a
vehicle.
 
The period of revocation shall commence upon the
release of the person from the period of
imprisonment imposed pursuant to this section.
2 The prior convictions (within the five-year period) that
trigger the enhanced penalties are convictions under both HRS §
291E-62 and its predecessor statute, HRS § 291-4.5, as the
predecessor statute was in effect on December 31, 2001.
 
3
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
4argument and sentenced her as a third-time offender pursuant to
the penalties set forth in HRS § 291E-62(b)(3).
As raised by the parties, the issue in this appeal is
whether prior OVLPSR-OVUII convictions are an essential offense
element that must be alleged in the charging instrument in order
to impose the enhanced penalties for repeat offenders under HRS 
§ 291E-62.  While this appeal was pending, the Hawai# i Supreme
Court decided State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai #i 383, 219 P.3d 1170
(2009).  Wheeler raises the additional question of whether the
OVLPSR-OVUII charges were sufficient where they failed to allege
that Bryan operated or assumed actual physical control of a
vehicle upon a public way, street, road, or highway.  Wheeler,
121 Hawai# i at 390-96, 219 P.3d at 1177-83.   
As to the Wheeler issue, we hold that under the liberal
construction standard, one of the two OVLPSR-OVUII charges was
sufficient and other one was not sufficient.  As to the issue
raised by the parties, we conclude that Hawai #i Supreme Court
cases construing similarly-structured versions of the statute
defining the offense of Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence
of an Intoxicant (OVUII), HRS § 291E-61, provide compelling
authority that prior OVLPSR-OVUII convictions are an essential
element that must be alleged in the charging instrument in order
to impose the enhanced recidivist penalties under HRS § 291E-62.
I. BACKGROUND
This appeal involves two separate cases, Cr. No. 05-1-
0252 and Cr. No. 05-1-2154.  In Cr. No. 05-1-0252, Bryan was
charged by written complaint with Habitually Operating a Vehicle
Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (Habitual OVUII) (Count I); 
OVLPSR-OVUII (Count II); leaving the scene of a motor vehicle
accident involving property damage (Count III); and storage of an
open container containing intoxicating liquor (Count IV).  Counts
II and IV provided as follows:
COUNT II:  On or about the 3rd day of September, 2004,
in the City and County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, ERIN E.
BRYAN, also known as Erin Bryan Merriam, a person whose
license and privilege to operate a vehicle has been revoked,FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
suspended, or otherwise restricted pursuant to Section 291E­
62 or to Part III or Section 291E-61, or 291E-61.5, or to
Part VII or Part XIV of Chapter 286 or Section 200-81, 291­4, 291-4.4, 291-4.5, or 291-7 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes
as those provisions were in effect on December 31, 2001, did
operate or assume actual physical control of any vehicle
while her license or privilege to operate a vehicle remained
suspended or revoked, thereby committing the offense of
Operating a Vehicle After License and Privilege Have Been
Suspended or Revoked for Operating a Vehicle Under the
Influence of an Intoxicant, in violation of Section 291E­62(a)(2) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.
 
. . . .
 
COUNT IV: On or about the 3rd day of September, 2004,
in the City and County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, ERIN E.
BRYAN, also known as Erin Bryan Merriam, did keep in a motor
vehicle when it was upon a public street, road, or highway
or at a scenic lookout, a bottle containing intoxicating
liquor which had been opened, or a seal broken, or the
contents of which had been partially removed or fully
removed, and such container was not kept in the trunk of the
vehicle, or kept in some other area of the vehicle not
normally occupied by the driver or passengers, if the
vehicle was not equipped with a trunk, thereby committing
the offense of Storage of Opened Container Containing
Intoxicating Liquor or Comsumption (sic) at Scenic Lookout,
in violation of Section 291-3.3(a) of the Hawaii Revised
Statutes.
 
(Emphases added.)
 
The record reflects that the charges in Cr. No. 05-1­
0252 stem from an incident in which Bryan, while driving her car, 
collided with another vehicle, fled the scene, and was
 subsequently spotted by a police officer as Bryan was making a
 left turn from Kaukonahua Road onto Kaamooloa Road in the City
 and County of Honolulu. The police officer activated his strobe
 light and siren and effected a traffic stop of Bryan's car in the
 area of Kaamooloa Road and Kuewa Drive. When Bryan opened her
 door, the police officer detected a strong odor of alcohol coming
 from the interior of the car, and he later found an open
 container on the floor of the car. The container's contents
 appeared to have spilled on the car's floor, causing the strong
 odor. Bryan's eyes appeared bloodshot, red, and glassy; there
 was an odor of alcohol on her breath; she had difficulty walking;
 and she showed signs of impairment in performing the field
 sobriety tests. A criminal history check revealed that Bryan had
 
5
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
three prior convictions for driving under the influence of
 
intoxicating liquor.
 
In Cr. No. 05-1-2154, Bryan was charged by complaint
 
with a single count of OVLPSR-OVUII, which provided as follows:
 
On or about the 8th day of October, 2004, in the City
and County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, ERIN BRYAN, also
known as Erin Bryan Merriam, a person whose license and
privilege to operate a vehicle had been revoked, suspended,
or otherwise restricted pursuant to Section 291E-62, Part
III or Section 291E-61, or to Part VII or Part XIV OF (sic)
Chapter 286 or Section 200-81, 291-4, 291-4.4, 291-4.5 or
291-7 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes as those provisions
were in effect on December 31, 2001, did operate or assume
actual physical control of any vehicle, in violation of any
restrictions placed on her license, and/or did operate or
assume actual physical control of any vehicle while her
license or privilege to operate a vehicle remained suspended
or revoked, thereby committing the offense of Operating a
Vehicle After License and Privilege Have Been Suspended or
Revoked for Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an
Intoxicant in violation of Section 291E-62(a)(1) and/or
291E-62(a)(2) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.
 
Bryan had two prior convictions for OVLPSR-OVUII that
 
were within five years of dates of the charged OVLPSR-OVUII
 
offenses in Cr. No. 05-1-0252 and Cr. No. 05-1-2154. On April
 11, 2007, Bryan pleaded no contest to all counts in Cr. No. 05-1­0252 and Cr. No. 05-1-2154.
3 During the plea colloquy, Bryan
 
stipulated to a factual basis for the no-contest pleas and agreed
 that if the case went to trial, the prosecution would have
 sufficient evidence to prove the charges.
 
Prior to sentencing, Bryan filed sentencing memoranda
 
in which she argued that she must be sentenced as a first-time
 offender for the OVLPSR-OVUII charges. Bryan contended that the 
prior OVLPSR-OVUII convictions were an essential element that the
 State was required, but had failed, to allege in the complaints
 in order to impose the enhanced penalties for a repeat offender. 
The State filed memoranda in opposition to Bryan's arguments. 
At sentencing, the circuit court rejected Bryan's
 
arguments and sentenced Bryan to the mandatory penalties
 
3 The Honorable Victoria S. Marks presided over Bryan's no-
contest pleas.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
applicable to a third-time offender on each of the OVLPSR-OVUII
 
charges: a one-year term of imprisonment, a $2,000 fine, and
 permanent revocation of her license.
4 With respect to the other
 
counts in Cr. No. 05-1-0252, the circuit court sentenced Bryan to
 five years of probation with a special condition of ten days of
 imprisonment for Count I, which charged her with Habitual OVUII;
 ten days of imprisonment for Count III, which charged her with
 leaving the scene of a motor vehicle accident involving property
 damage; and a $1,000 fine on Count IV, which charged her with
 storage of an open container containing intoxicating liquor. The
 circuit court ordered that the sentences on all the counts be
 served concurrently with each other. 
The circuit court entered its Judgment on Counts II,
 
III, and IV on July 31, 2007, and its Amended Judgment on Count I
 on October 22, 2007, in Cr. No. 05-1-0252, and it entered its
 Judgment in Cr. No. 05-1-2154 on July 31, 2007. Bryan appeals
 from these judgments.
5 The circuit court granted Bryan's motions
 
for bail pending appeal on the OVLPSR-OVUII counts. 
II. DISCUSSION
 
A.
 
We first address the question of the sufficiency of the 
OVLPSR-OVUII charges raised by Wheeler. 
1.
 
In Wheeler, 121 Hawai 'i at 385, 219 P.3d at 1127, the 
defendant was prosecuted for OVUII, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 291E-61(a)(1) (2007). That section provides: 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the person
operates or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle: 
4 The Honorable Virginia L. Crandall presided over Bryan's
sentencing.
5 We granted Bryan's motions to consolidate her appeals from
the judgments in Cr. No. 05-1-0252 and Cr. No. 05-1-2154, and we
consolidated the appeals under Appeal No. 28718.

  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(1)	 While under the influence of alcohol in an
 
amount sufficient to impair the person's normal
mental faculties or ability to care for the
person and guard against casualty[.] 
HRS § 291E-1 (2007), the definitions section for HRS Chapter
 
291E, provides, in relevant part, that the term "'[o]perate'
 means to drive or assume actual physical control of a vehicle
 upon a public way, street, road, or highway . . . ." (Emphasis
 added.) 
The oral charge in Wheeler tracked the language of HRS 
§ 291E-61(a)(1) (2007) and alleged that Wheeler "did operate or assume actual physical control of a . . . vehicle." Wheeler, 121 
Hawai
'i at 386-87, 219 P.3d at 1173-74. The oral charge did not, 
however, include the statutory definition of "operate," namely, that Wheeler drove or assumed actual physical control of a vehicle "upon a public way, street, road, or highway." HRS § 291E-1 (emphasis added). The "upon a public way, street, road, or highway" language of HRS § 291E-1 (hereinafter, the "public­road requirement") creates a locational limitation for the OVUII offense. Wheeler, 121 Hawai
'i at 391-93, 219 P.3d at 1178-80. 
The supreme court held that the public-road
 
requirement, which is contained in the statutory definition of
 the term "operate," is an attendant circumstance of the OVUII
 offense and therefore is an essential element that had to be
 charged against Wheeler. Id. The supreme court further held
 
that merely alleging that Wheeler did "operate" a vehicle was
 insufficient to charge the public-road requirement, an essential
 element of the offense. Id. at 393-96, 219 P.3d at 1180-83. The
 
court's decision was based on the unusual statutory definition of
 "operate," which imposes a location requirement that does not
 comport with the commonly understood meaning of the term
 "operate." Id. at 394, 219 P.3d at 1181. The court noted that
 
the common definition of the term "operate" does not
 "geographically limit where the conduct must take place." Id. 
Thus, the statutory definition of operate "is neither
 'unmistakeable' nor 'readily comprehensible to persons of common
 
8
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
understanding.'" Id. (citations omitted). Accordingly, the
 
court concluded that alleging that Wheeler did "operate" a
 
vehicle did not provide adequate notice to Wheeler that the
 prosecution was required to prove the public-road requirement as
 an element of the charged OVUII offense. Id. at 395, 219 P.3d at
 
1182.
6
 
Wheeler objected to the sufficiency of the charge
 
before trial. Id. at 387, 219 P.3d 1170. Because Wheeler timely
 
objected, the supreme court did not apply the liberal
 construction rule used in cases where a defendant fails to timely
 challenge the sufficiency of the charge. Id. at 399-400, 219
 
P.3d at 1186-87. The supreme court noted that the distinction
 between a timely and untimely objection to the sufficiency of the
 charge was "significant since this court has applied different
 principles depending on whether or not an objection was timely
 raised in the trial court. Id. at 399, 219 P.3d at 1186. The
 
court specifically reserved, and did not address, the question of
 whether it would have found the OVUII charge against Wheeler to
 be insufficient under the liberal construction standard. Id. at
 
400 n.19, 219 P.3d at 1187 n.19.
 
2.
 
6 The Hawai 'i Supreme Court explained that the lack of
conformity between the commonly understood meaning of the term
"operate" and its statutory definition distinguished Wheeler fromthe United States Supreme Court decision in Hamling v. UnitedStates, 418 U.S. 87 (1974). Wheeler, 121 Hawai
'i at 394, 219
P.3d at 1181. In Hamling, the United States Supreme Courtrejected the defendant's claim that the indictment wasinsufficient because the government used the term "obscene" inthe indictment without pleading the component elements of theconstitutional definition of obscenity. Hamling, 418 U.S. at 
117-19. Unlike in Wheeler, there is no comparable lack ofconformity between the commonly understood meaning of "obscenity"and its constitutional definition. In distinguishing Hamling, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court observed that "it is significant that
the term 'obscenity' itself provided a person of commonunderstanding with some notice of the nature of the prohibitedconduct." Wheeler, 121 Hawai
'i at 394, 219 P.3d at 1181. 
9
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
The same statutory definition of "operate" applicable 
to the OVUII offense in Wheeler applies to the OVLPSR-OVUII 
offenses against Bryan in this case. See HRS § 291E-1 (providing 
that "[a]s used in [HRS Chapter 291E]," the statutory definitions, including that of the term "operate," apply "unless the context otherwise requires"). Like the OVUII charge considered in Wheeler, the OVLPSR-OVUII charges in this case alleged that Bryan "did operate or assume actual physical control of" a vehicle but did not include the statutory definition of "operate" and allege that such conduct took place "upon a public way, street, road, or highway." Bryan did not challenge the sufficiency of the OVLPSR-OVUII charges in the circuit court on the ground that they failed to allege the public-road requirement, and Bryan does raise such a challenge on appeal. However, we have an obligation to sua sponte determine whether we have jurisdiction. See Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai
'i 153, 157, 
80 P.3d 974, 978 (2003). And under Hawai 'i precedent, the 
sufficiency of a charge is regarded as "jurisdictional." State 
v. Cummings, 101 Hawai 'i 139, 142-43, 63 P.3d 1109, 1112-13 
(2003).7 
As noted, Bryan did not timely object to the
 
sufficiency of the OVLPSR-OVUII charges on the ground that they
 failed to allege the public-road requirement. Thus, Bryan's case
 is different from Wheeler where a timely objection to the
 sufficiency of the charge was raised. We apply the liberal
 
7 In Cummings, the Hawai 'i Supreme Court stated that "a
defect in a complaint is not one of mere form, which is waivable,
nor simply one of notice, which may be deemed harmless if adefendant was actually aware of the nature of the accusationagainst him or her, but, rather, is one of substantive subjectmatter jurisdiction, which may not be waived or dispensed with,and that is per se prejudicial. Cummings, 101 Hawai
'i at 143, 63
P.3d at 1113 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted);but see United States v. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625, 630-31 (2002)(holding that defects in an indictment do not deprive a court ofjurisdiction). 
10
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
construction rule in evaluating the sufficiency of Bryan's
 
OVLPSR-OVUII charges. The court in Wheeler explained this rule
 as follows:
 
Under the "Motta/Wells post-conviction liberal construction
rule," we liberally construe charges challenged for thefirst time on appeal. See [State v.]Merino, 81 Hawai' i 
[198,] 212, 915 P.2d [672,] 686 [(1996)]; [State v. ]Wells,78 Hawai' i [373,] 381, 894 P.2d [70,] 78 [(1995)]; [State v.
]Elliott, 77 Hawai' i [309,] 311, 884 P.2d [372,] 374
[(1994)]; State v. Motta, 66 Haw. 89, 90, 657 P.2d 1019,1019-20 (1983). Under this approach, there is a"presumption of validity," [State v. ]Sprattling, 99 Hawai' i 
[312,] 318, 55 P.3d [276,] 282 [(2002)], for chargeschallenged subsequent to a conviction. In those circumstances, this court will "not reverse a convictionbased upon a defective indictment [or complaint] unless thedefendant can show prejudice or that the indictment [orcomplaint] cannot within reason be construed to charge acrime." Merino, 81 Hawai' i at 212, 915 P.2d at 686
(citation omitted). 
Id. at 399-400, 219 P.3d at 1186-87 (some brackets in original).
 
In applying the liberal construction rule, the Hawai 'i 
Supreme Court has recognized that "[o]ne way in which an 
otherwise deficient count can be reasonably construed to charge a crime is by an examination of the charge as a whole." State v. 
Elliott, 77 Hawai
'i 309, 312, 884 P.2d 372, 375 (1994) (citing 
State v. Schroeder, 76 Hawai 'i 517, 530, 880 P.2d 192, 205 (1994) 
(construing kidnapping and robbery counts together and as a whole and holding that the allegation that the defendant had used a handgun in the robbery count cured the failure to include this required allegation in the kidnapping count)). 
Here, although the Count II (OVLPSR-OVUII) charge in 
Cr. No. 05-1-0252 did not allege the public-road requirement, the Count IV (storage of an open container containing intoxicating liquor) charge in the same complaint alleged that Bryan did keep the prohibited open container in "a motor vehicle when it was upon a public street, road, or highway or at a scenic lookout[.]" Applying the liberal construction rule, when Counts II and IV are read together, the complaint can "within reason be construed" to allege the public-road requirement and to charge the crime of OVLPSR-OVUII. See Wheeler, 121 Hawai
'i at 400, 219 P.3d at 1187. 
11
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Both Counts II and IV refer to conduct committed by Bryan on or 
about September 3, 2004, in the City and County of Honolulu, that involved Bryan's use of a vehicle. Construing Counts II and IV together, it is reasonable to infer that both counts refer to the same incident. "[T]he purpose of an indictment [or a complaint] is to apprise the accused of the charges against him, so that he may adequately prepare his defense, and to describe the crime charged with sufficient specificity to enable him to protect against future jeopardy for the same offense." State v. 
Vanstory, 91 Hawai
'i 33, 44, 979 P.2d 1059, 1070 (1999) (internal 
quotation marks and citation omitted). Under the liberal construction standard, we conclude that the complaint in Cr. No. 05-1-0252 sufficiently alleged the OVLPSR-OVUII offense.
8 
8 We note that the Count I (Habitual OVUII) charge in Cr.
No. 05-1-0252 also failed to allege the public-road requirement.
However, applying the same analysis, we conclude that under the
liberal construction rule, when Count I is construed together
with Count IV, the complaint sufficiently alleged the Habitual
OVUII offense. On appeal, Bryan did not challenge his conviction
or sentence on the Count I (Habitual OVUII) offense, and we
affirm the circuit court's Amended Judgment on Count I.
 
12
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
On the other hand, in Cr. No. 05-1-2154, Bryan was 
charged by complaint with a single count of OVLPSR-OVUII. There 
was no companion count alleging the public-road requirement. We conclude that there is no basis for reasonably construing the complaint in Cr. No. 05-1-2154 to allege the public-road requirement, which is an essential element of the OVLPSR-OVUII offense. See Wheeler, 121 Hawai
'i at 390-96, 219 P.3d at 1177­
83. Accordingly, we vacate the Judgment entered in Cr. No. 05-1­
2154, and we remand the case with instructions to dismiss the
 complaint in that case without prejudice. 
B.
 
We now turn to the question raised by the parties on 
appeal, namely, whether prior OVLPSR-OVUII convictions are an essential offense element that must be alleged in the charging instrument in order to impose the enhanced penalties for repeat offenders under HRS § 291E-62. We answer that question in the affirmative. We conclude that our decision is controlled by Hawai
'i Supreme Court cases construing similarly-structured 
versions of HRS § 291E-61, the OVUII offense statute. We therefore begin with a discussion of those precedents. 
1. 
In State v. Domingues, 106 Hawai
'i 480, 107 P.3d 409 
(2005), the Hawai 'i Supreme Court construed the version of the 
OVUII statute that took effect on January 1, 2002, HRS § 291E-61 (Supp. 2001).
9 The court determined that HRS § 291E-61 was a 
9 HRS § 291E-61 (Supp. 2001) provided in relevant part:
 
§291E-61 Operating a vehicle under the influence
of an intoxicant.  (a) A person commits the offense of
operating a vehicle under the influence of an
intoxicant if the person operates or assumes actual
physical control of a vehicle:
 
(1) 	While under the influence of alcohol in an
 amount sufficient to impair the person's
normal mental faculties or ability to care
for the person and guard against casualty;
(continued...)
 
13
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
9(...continued)
(2) While under the influence of any drug that
impairs the person's ability to operate the
vehicle in a careful and prudent manner;
 
(3) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two
hundred ten liters of breath; or
(4) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per one
hundred milliliters or cubic centimeters of
 blood.

essential element of the offenses imposing enhanced penalties. 
Domingues, 106 Hawai 'i at 487-88, 107 P.3d at 416-17. The 
supreme court concluded that the "prefatory language of HRS 
§ 291E-61(b)(1) through 291E-61(b)(4)," which included language 
requiring qualifying prior convictions, "describes attendant
 circumstances that are intrinsic to and 'enmeshed' in the
 hierarchy of offenses that HRS § 291E-61 as a whole describes." 
Id. at 487, 107 P.3d at 416 (citation omitted).

In support of its conclusion, the court noted that an
 
offense under HRS § 291E-61(b)(4) (Supp. 2001) was a felony,
 which would entitle the defendant to a jury trial, "whereas the
 offenses described in HRS §§ 291E-61(b)(1) through (3) [(Supp.
 2001)] would appear to be petty misdemeanors, as to which no
 right to a jury trial would attach." Id. at 487 n.8, 107 P.3d at
 416 n.8. The court explained: 
If the prefatory language of HRS §§ 291E-61(b)(1) through
(b)(4) [(Supp. 2001)] were mere 'sentencing factors' that
the prosecution was not obliged to allege and prove to the
trier of fact, . . . then defendants charged with HRS
§ 291E-61 [(Supp. 2001)] offenses would have no idea what
the particular offense was that they were charged with
committing or whether they were entitled to a jury trial. 
Id. According to the court's analysis, because qualifying prior
 
convictions were an essential element of and intrinsic to the
 
OVUII offenses imposing enhanced penalties under HRS § 291E-61,
 they "'must be alleged in the charging instrument in order to
 
10 In Domingues, the Hawai 'i Supreme Court construed HRS §
291E-61 (Supp. 2001) in the context of a defendant charged with
habitually driving under the influence of intoxicating liquorunder HRS § 291-4.4 (Supp. 2000). The trial court had grantedthe defendant's motion to dismiss this charge on the ground thatHRS § 291-4.4 (Supp. 2000), which had been in effect when thedefendant committed the offense, had been repealed without ageneral savings clause before the defendant was indicted.Effective January 1, 2002, the legislature repealed HRS § 291-4.4(Supp. 2000) and enacted HRS § 291E-61 (Supp. 2001). The supremecourt held that because HRS § 291E-61 (Supp. 2001) was asubstantial reenactment of HRS § 291-4.4 (Supp. 2000),prosecution of the defendant under the repealed statute waspermissible.

give the defendant notice that they will be relied on to prove
 
the defendant's guilt and support the sentence to be imposed, and
 they must be determined by the trier of fact.'" Id. at 487-88,
 
107 P.3d at 416-17 (block quote format, citations, and brackets

Two years after Domingues, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court 
had the opportunity to address whether Domingues's analysis of HRS § 291E-61 (Supp. 2001) was still valid. In State v. Kekuewa, 114 Hawai
'i 411, 163 P.3d 1148 (2007), the Hawai 'i Supreme Court 
rejected the State's request that the court "overrule Domingues to the extent that it characterizes the provisions set forth in 
HRS §§ 291E-61(b)(1)-(4)(Supp. 2002)[ 11] as attendant

circumstances." Id.
 at 419, 163 P.3d at 1156. In support of its
 
refusal to overturn Domingues, the court noted that Domingues
 "recognized that construing §§ 291E-61(b)(1)-(4)(Supp. 2002) as
 extrinsic sentencing factors[,]" rather than attendant
 circumstances that were required to be alleged in the charging
 instrument, "would have raised serious concerns regarding the
 statute's constitutionality, given a defendant's inability to
 ascertain the class and grade of the offense charged (i.e., a
 petty misdemeanor or a class C felony) and whether the right to a
 jury has or has not attached." Id. at 420, 163 P.3d at 1157. 
In State v. Ruggiero, 114 Hawai
'i 227, 160 P.3d 703 
(2007), the Hawai 'i Supreme Court considered whether the 
Domingues analysis of HRS § 291E-61 retained its validity after the Hawai
'i Legislature's amendment of HRS § 291E-61 in 2003. 
Significant to our analysis in Bryan's case, the 2003 legislative 
11 We note that the court in Kekuewa cites to "Supp. 2002"
 
as the version of HRS § 291E-61 construed in Domingues, whereas
the court in Domingues construed the Supp. 2001 version of HRS §
291E-61. In any event, the differences between the Supp. 2001
and Supp. 2002 versions of HRS § 291E-61 is not material to the
court's analysis in either case. The only difference between
these two versions was that in the Supp. 2002 version, a $25
surcharge to be deposited into the neurotrama special fund was
added to the penalties set forth in HRS § 291E-61(b)(1) through
(b)(4). See 2002 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 160, § 11 at 566-67.

amendments excised the class C felony offense from HRS § 291E­
61(b)(4) and created a separate offense of Habitual OVUII
 codified at HRS § 291E-61.5. See 2003 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 71, 
§§ 1 and 3 at 123-26. 
12 However, the 2003 legislative
 
amendments did not change the essential language of HRS §§ 291E­61(a) and (b)(1) to (3) (Supp. 2001) that was analyzed by the
 court in Domingues.
13 The Hawai 'i Supreme Court declined to 
overrule its analysis in Domingues in light of the 2003
 legislative amendments and held:
 
The Domingues analysis . . . retains its vitality, inasmuch
as considerations of due process continue to require thatthe aggravating factors set forth in HRS § 291E-61(b) -- allof which remain "attendant circumstances that are intrinsic to and 'enmeshed' in the hierarchy of offenses that HRS§ 291E-61 as a whole describes," Domingues, 106 Hawai' i at 
487, 107 P.3d at 416 -- be alleged in the charginginstrument and proven beyond a reasonable doubt at trial.

HRS § 291E-61 and HRS § 291E-62 are companion
 
provisions in the same chapter of the HRS. In addition, the
 
overall statutory framework of HRS § 291E-62, and its provisions
 setting forth the applicable penalties in particular, are closely
 analogous to the structure of HRS § 291E-61 (Supp. 2001)
 construed in Domingues. Both HRS § 291E-61 (Supp. 2001) and HRS
 § 291E-62 provide for an escalating degree of punishment based on
 
12 In addition to excising the class C felony offense from
HRS § 291E-61(b)(4) and codifying it as a different statute, the
2003 legislative amendments renumbered the existing HRS § 291E­61(b)(5) as (b)(4) and amended subsection (c) to make HRS § 291E­61(b)(1) to (3) status offenses. See 2003 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 
71, §§ 1 and 3 at 123-26; Ruggiero, 114 Hawai
'i at 234 n.10, 160
P.3d at 710 n.10. 
13 The only difference between the language of HRS §§ 291E­
61(a) and (b)(1) to (3) (Supp. 2001) construed in Domingues and
the language of those provisions after the 2003 legislative
amendments was the addition of the $25 neurotrama surcharge to
the penalties set forth in HRS § 291E-61(b)(1) through (b)(4).
See footnote 11, supra; 2002 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 160, § 11 at

whether the current offense was committed within a prescribed 
time period of one or more prior convictions. Moreover, like HRS § 291E-61 (Supp. 2001) construed in Domingues, HRS § 291E­62(b) mixes OVLPSR-OVUII offenses that would entitle the defendant to a jury trial with those that would not. The penalty for a violation of HRS § 291E-62(b)(3) is one year of imprisonment, which would entitle a defendant to a jury trial, while the penalty for violations of HRS §§ 291E-62(b)(1) and (2) would be petty misdemeanors for which no right to a jury trial would appear to attach. Thus, construing HRS § 291E-62 to mean that prior qualifying convictions were simply sentencing factors that need not be alleged in the charging instrument would raise due process concerns regarding adequate notice and a defendant's ability to ascertain whether he or she had a right to a jury trial. See Domingues, 106 Hawai
'i at 487 & n.8, 107 P.3d at 416 
& n.8; Kekuewa, 114 Hawai 'i at 420, 163 P.3d at 1157. This 
concern was an important reason why the supreme court in Domingues construed prior convictions for purposes of HRS § 291E­61 (Supp. 2001) to be attendant circumstances that had to be alleged in the charging instrument. See Kekuewa, 114 Hawai
'i at 
420-21, 163 P.3d at 1157-58. 
We conclude that the supreme court's analysis in
 
Domingues, Kekuewa, and Ruggiero controls our decision in this
 case. Applying the supreme court's analysis in these cases to
 HRS § 291E-62, we hold that qualifying prior OVLPSR-OVUII
 convictions are attendant circumstances and an essential offense
 element that must be alleged in the charging instrument in order
 to impose the enhanced penalties for repeat offenders under HRS 
§ 291E-62. See also HRS § 1-16 (2009) ("Laws in pari materia, or
 upon the same subject matter, shall be construed with reference
 to each other. What is clear in one statute may be called upon
 

 in aid to explain what is doubtful in another.").

The State concedes that prior qualifying convictions
 
must be alleged in the charging instrument in order to sentence
 
19
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
the defendant as a third-time offender under HRS § 291E-62(b)(3),
 
because that subsection provides for one year of imprisonment,
 which would entitle the defendant to a jury trial. However, the
 State contends that a prior qualifying conviction would not be an
 essential element that must be alleged in the charging instrument
 for purposes of HRS § 291E-62(b)(2), because that subsection
 provides for thirty days of imprisonment for a second-time
 offender, making the offense a petty misdemeanor that would not
 require a jury trial. Thus, the State contends that although the
 circuit court did not have the authority to sentence Bryan as a
 third-time offender under HRS § 291E-62(b)(3), the circuit court
 does have the authority to sentence Byran as a second-time
 offender under HRS § 291E-62(b)(2). 
We decline to parse HRS § 291E-62(b) in the manner 
suggested by the State and to hold that prior qualifying convictions constitute an essential offense element for purposes of HRS § 291E-62(b)(3) but not for purposes of HRS § 291E­62(b)(2). In Ruggerio, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court construed HRS 
§ 291E-61 after the 2003 legislative amendments had excised the class C felony offense and had left HRS § 291E-61 with only petty misdemeanor offenses. The court affirmed its analysis in Domingues that qualifying prior convictions constituted an attendant circumstance and an essential element of the offenses imposing enhanced penalties that were required to be alleged in the charging instrument. Ruggerio, 114 Hawai
'i at 237-39, 160 
P.3d at 713-14. 
Accordingly, in Cr. No. 05-1-0252, we vacate Bryan's
 
conviction and sentence as a third-time OVLPSR-OVUII offender on
 Count II, and we remand that case for entry of a judgment of
 conviction and resentencing of Bryan as a first-time offender 
under HRS §§ 291E-62(a)(2) and (b)(1)
14 on that count. See
 
14 HRS § 291E-62(b)(1) applies to both first-time offenders
and offenders without a prior qualifying conviction.
