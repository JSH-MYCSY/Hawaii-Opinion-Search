APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

NAKAMURA, C.J., FOLEY AND REIFURTH, JJ.
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY FOLEY, J.
 
Defendant-Appellant Lucyna Bielski, formerly known as

 
Lucyna Bielski Baker, (Bielski) appeals from the Decree Granting
 
Absolute Divorce (Decree) filed on July 31, 2007 in the Family
 Court of the First Circuit (family court).
1 In the Decree, among
 
other things, the family court ordered Plaintiff-Appellee Gary
 Sidney Baker (Baker) to pay alimony to Bielski for six months,
 
1

FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
divided the parties' property, and ordered each party to be
 
responsible for his or her own attorneys' fees.2
 
3
On appeal,  Bielski contends:
(1) The family court abused its discretion in dividing

 
the parties' assets and debts.
 
(a) The family court either erroneously failed to
 
divide Baker's commissions on pending escrow and non-binding
 reservation agreements (commissions) or erroneously awarded all
 of Baker's commissions to him because the commissions were
 marital assets and not Baker's separate property. Related to
 these arguments is Bielski's contention that in the family
 court's November 2, 2007 Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law
 (FOF/COL), Finding of Fact (FOF) 140 is clearly erroneous and
 Conclusion of Law (COL) 6 is wrong.
 
(b) The family court either failed to equalize or
 
erroneously equalized the parties' assets and debts. Related to
 this argument is Bielski's contention that COL 6 is wrong.
 
(i) The family court "did not literally
 
award each party one-half of each and every asset and debt."
 
(ii) The family court apparently failed to
 
rely on a property division chart when it divided the parties'
 assets and debts and so could not have had a reasonable means of
 determining the asset and debt division.
 
(iii) Even if the family court relied on a
 
property division chart, the court improperly equalized the
 parties' assets and debts because the court erroneously included
 in the calculation an amount Baker owed for 2006 income taxes,
 after ruling that Baker was to be solely responsible for it;
 failed to divide credit card debt between the parties; and failed
 to include the amount Bielski owed for attorney's fees and costs
 in the calculation.
 
2
 The family court ordered the parties to pay for their own attorneys'
fees, except for $2,500 of Bielski's attorneys' fees, which the court ordered
Baker to pay.
3
 Bielski's Opening Brief fails to comply with Hawai' i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(1) in that it does not include a subjectindex and table of authorities. Counsel for Bielski is warned that future noncompliance with HRAP Rule 28(b)(1) may result in sanctions against him.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(c) The family court erred in awarding Baker pre­
marital contribution credit for the value of property located on
 
Burnet Street in Oakville, Canada (the Burnet Property), based on
 the property's purchase value three years prior to the marriage,
 because the purchase was too remote in time to form the basis of
 the court's valuation. Related to this argument is Bielski's
 contention that FOFs 5 and 156.A are clearly erroneous and COLs
 10 and 15 are wrong.
 
(2) The family court made procedural errors with
 
regard to Baker's Trial Exhibit 47 (Exhibit 47).
 
(a) The family court erred by admitting into
 
evidence Exhibit 47, which constituted hearsay without exception.
 
(b) The family court plainly erred by allowing
 
Baker to testify regarding Exhibit 47 before it was admitted into
 evidence and over Bielski's objection to its admission into
 evidence.
 
I.
 
On July 5, 2006, Baker filed a Complaint for Divorce,
 
in which he requested a divorce from Bielski. The family court
 held trial on July 9 and 17, 2007. On July 31, 2007, the family
 court filed the Decree, and on November 2, 2007, the court filed
 its FOF/COL. Attached to the FOF/COL was a property division
 chart.
 
II.
 
A. Family Court Decisions
 
Generally, the family court possesses wide
discretion in making its decisions and those
decisions will not be set aside unless there is
 a manifest abuse of discretion. Thus, [an
appellate court] will not disturb the family
court's decisions on appeal unless the family
court disregarded rules or principles of law or
practice to the substantial detriment of a party
litigant and its decision clearly exceeded the
bounds of reason.

B. Division of Assets
 
"[T]he division of property is discretionary with the
 
trial court and will not be disturbed on review unless abuse of
 
discretion is clearly shown." Farias v. Farias, 58 Haw. 227,
 
231, 566 P.2d 1104, 1108 (1977).
C. Findings of Fact
 
The family court's FOFs are reviewed on appeal under
the "clearly erroneous" standard. A[n] FOF is clearly
erroneous when (1) the record lacks substantial evidence to
support the finding, or (2) despite substantial evidence in
support of the finding, the appellate court is nonetheless
left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has
 been made. "Substantial evidence" is credible evidence
 which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable
a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion.
 
Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawai 'i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006) 
(quoting In re Doe, 95 Hawai 'i 183, 190, 20 P.3d 616, 623 
(2001)). 
D. Conclusions of Law
 
A family court's conclusions of law "are reviewed on 
appeal de novo, under the right/wrong standard . . . [and] 
consequently, are not binding upon an appellate court and are freely reviewable for their correctness." Fisher, 111 Hawai
'i at 
46, 137 P.3d at 360 (quoting In re Doe, 95 Hawai 'i at 190, 20 
P.3d at 623).
E. Admission of Evidence
 
The family court has broad discretion to determine 
appropriate evidence for trial, and this court reviews such rulings under the abuse of discretion standard. See Miyamoto v. 
Lum, 104 Hawai
'i 1, 7, 84 P.3d 509, 515 (2004) (the lower court's 
grant or denial of a motion in limine is reviewed for abuse of discretion); see also Fisher, 111 Hawai
'i at 46, 137 P.3d at 360 
(generally, the family court has broad discretion).

A. DIVISION OF ASSETS AND DEBTS
 
"There is no fixed rule for determining the amount of 
property to be awarded each spouse in a divorce action other than as set forth in HRS § 580-47." Teller v. Teller, 99 Hawai
'i 101, 
107, 53 P.3d 240, 246 (2002) (footnote omitted) (quoting Au-Hoy v. Au-Hoy, 60 Haw. 354, 357, 590 P.2d 80, 82 (1979)). In Prell

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
5v. Silverstein, 114 Hawai #i 286, 162 P.3d 2 (App. 2007), this
court set forth general principles governing divorce distribution
of property:
HRS § 580-47 (2006 Repl.) provides . . . in relevant
part, as follows:
Support orders; division of property. (a) Upon
granting a divorce, or thereafter if, in addition to
the powers granted in subsections (c) and (d),
jurisdiction of those matters is reserved under the
decree by agreement of both parties or by order of
court after finding that good cause exists, the court
may make any further orders as shall appear just and
equitable (1) compelling the parties or either of them
to provide for the support, maintenance, and education
of the children of the parties; (2) compelling either
party to provide for the support and maintenance of
the other party; (3) finally dividing and distributing
the estate of the parties, real, personal, or mixed,
whether community, joint, or separate; and (4)
allocating, as between the parties, the responsibility
for the payment of the debts of the parties whether
community, joint, or separate, and the attorney's
fees, costs, and expenses incurred by each party by
reason of the divorce.  In making these further
orders, the court shall take into consideration:  the
respective merits of the parties, the relative
abilities of the parties, the condition in which each
party will be left by the divorce, the burdens imposed
upon either party for the benefit of the children of
the parties, and all other circumstances of the case.
[. . . .]
The Hawai# i Supreme Court has stated that the
foregoing statute confers "wide discretion upon the family
court."  Gussin v. Gussin, 73 Haw. 470, 479, 836 P.2d 484,
489 (1992).  However,
in adjudicating the rights of parties to a divorce,
the family court strives for a certain degree of
uniformity, stability, clarity or predictability in
its decision-making and thus family court judges are
compelled to apply the appropriate law to the facts of
each case and be guided by reason and conscience to
attain a just result.  The partnership model is the
appropriate law for the family courts to apply when
exercising their discretion in the adjudication of
property division in divorce proceedings.
Tougas v. Tougas, 76 Hawai# i 19, 28, 868 P.2d 437, 446
(1994) (citations, internal quotation marks, and brackets
omitted).
Under general partnership law, "each partner is
entitled to be repaid his or her contributions to the
partnership property, whether made by way of capital
or advances."  59A Am. Jur. 2d Partnership § 476
(1987) (footnotes omitted).  Absent a legally
permissible and binding partnership agreement to the
contrary, "partners share equally in the profits of
their partnership, even though they may have
contributed unequally to capital or services."  Id.  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
§ 469 (footnotes omitted). Hawaii partnership law
provides in relevant part as follows:
 
Rules determining rights and duties of partners.

The rights and duties of the partners in
relation to the partnership shall be determined,
subject to any agreement between them, by the
following rules:
 
(a) Each partner shall be repaid the
partner's contributions, whether by way of
capital or advances to the partnership property
and share equally in the profits and surplus
remaining after all liabilities, including those
to partners, are satisfied; and must contribute
towards the losses, whether of capital or
otherwise, sustained by the partnership
according to the partner's share in the profits.
 
Gardner v. Gardner, 8 Haw. App. 461, [465], 810 P.2d
239, 242 (1991) (quoting HRS § 425-118(a) (1985)).
Therefore, if there is no agreement between the
 
husband and wife defining the respective property
 interests, partnership principles dictate an equal
division of the marital estate "where the only facts
proved are the marriage itself and the existence of
jointly owned property." Gussin, 73 Haw. at 484, 836
P.2d at 491 (quoting [Hashimoto v. Hashimoto, 6 Haw.
 
App. 424, 427 n.4, 725 P.2d 520, 522 n.4 (1986)]).
 
Id. at 27-28, 868 P.2d at 445-46 (emphases added).
 
In Hussey v. Hussey, 77 Hawai' i 202, 881 P.2d 1270
(App. 1994), this court construed Tougas as establishing
three classifications of property that must be divided and
distributed in a divorce proceeding:
 
Premarital Separate Property. This was the
 
property owned by each spouse immediately prior to
their marriage or cohabitation that was concluded by
their marriage. Upon marriage, this property became
either Marital Separate Property or Marital
Partnership Property.
 
Marital Separate Property.  This is the
 
following property owned by one or both of the spouses
at the time of the divorce:
 
[. . . .] 
c.	 All property that (1) was acquired by the
spouse-owner during the marriage by gift
or inheritance, (2) was expressly
classified by the donee/heir-spouse-owner
as his or her separate property, and (3)
after acquisition, was maintained by
itself and/or sources other than one or
both of the spouses and funded by sources
other than marital partnership income or
property.
 
Marital Partnership Property.  All property that
is not Marital Separate Property.
 
Id. at 206-07, 881 P.2d at 1274-75. We also noted that
 
6
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
although Marital Separate Property cannot be used by
the family court to "offset," [Tougas, 76 Hawai' i] at
32, 868 P.2d at 450, the award of Marital Partnership
Property to the other spouse, it can be used by thefamily court to "alter the ultimate distribution ofMarital Partnership Property based on the respective
separate conditions of the spouses." Id. In other 
words, Marital Separate Property is property that has
been validly excluded from the marital partnership.
Although the family court may allow Marital Separate 
Property to reasonably influence the division and distribution of Marital Partnership Property, it cannot award any Marital Separate Property to the non-owner spouse.  Consequently, the five categories of
[net market values (NMVs)] listed in Tougas, 76Hawai'i at 27, 868 P.2d at 445, apply only to Marital
Partnership Property, not to Marital SeparateProperty. 
Id. at 207, 881 P.2d at 1275[.] 
114 Hawai 'i at 291-94, 162 P.3d at 7-10 (brackets in original and 
footnote omitted).
1. Baker's commissions
 
Bielski contends the family court either erroneously
 
failed to divide Baker's commissions, which were marital assets, 
or erroneously awarded the commissions to Baker because they were
 not Baker's separate property. Related to these arguments is
 Bielski's contention that COL 6 is wrong and FOF 140, clearly
 erroneous. COL 6 provides that "[t]he court properly applied the
 law of equitable distribution and exercised its discretion in
 dividing the assets and debts of the marital estate equally
 between the parties." FOFs 139 and 140, in the "Alimony" section
 of the FOF/COL provide:
 
139. [Bielski] spent much time and money on many
subpoenas, which yielded no hidden assets of [Baker].
 
140. The only additional potential income [Bielski]
stood to receive [in the divorce] was from two newly
acquired escrows, which were not due to close until 2008 and
2009. These escrows were for units in condominium buildings
not yet constructed, and thus any commission will [sic] be
earned [by Baker] well after the divorce action concluded.
 
Throughout the marriage, Baker worked in real estate,
 
first as a sales agent, then as a broker. At trial, on direct
 
examination by his counsel, Baker testified that Bielski disputed
 the 2006 income amount Baker entered on his Asset and Debt
 Statement. Baker stated that during discovery, Bielski was
 fixated on discovering commissions she thought Baker made on
 
7
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
escrows from that year, but at that time Baker believed all of
 
the escrows had been cancelled because the units were in a
 project with financial problems. A week before trial, Baker
 learned that one of the escrows was still open. The escrow was
 for a unit in a condominium building under construction at the
 time of trial. Baker would not receive a commission on that
 escrow until it closed in 2008.
 
4
On direct examination by Bielski,  Baker testified that
at the time of trial he had two escrows -- one of which he had
 opened that day -- and three non-binding reservation agreements.
5
 
He later testified that clients of only two of the non-binding
 reservation agreements had paid their deposits and the third
 client had not yet paid, "so that's kind of risky." When Bielski
 began asking Baker why he had not reported the escrows on his
 Asset and Debt Statement, the court interjected and stated that
 the escrows did not constitute property because "[a]n escrow can
 change, it can fall out of escrow." Baker testified that one of
 the escrows was scheduled to close on "August the 31st" and the
 other, in 2008.
 
Intangible property, such as income, is subject to 
equitable distribution. Teller, 99 Hawai
'i at 109, 53 P.3d at 
248 (holding that "intangible property is subject to equitable distribution"). It is well-established that a party's income earned and acquired during the marriage is part of the marital estate. See Hatayama v. Hatayama, 9 Haw. App. 1, 12, 818 P.2d 
277, 282 (1991) ("During a marriage, in the absence of a legally permissible and binding agreement otherwise, the husband's and the wife's earnings are marital partnership earnings[.]"); Wakayama v. Wakayama, 4 Haw. App. 652, 654, 673 P.2d 1044, 1046 (1983) ("[D]uring marriage a spouse's wages and the products of a spouse's personal efforts are marital assets[.]"). The marital estate "means anything of present or prospective value, owned by

 Bielski represented herself at trial.
 
5
 Baker testified that in a non-binding reservation agreement, a client
put down money to reserve the right to purchase a unit in a new construction
project. The agreement became binding once a public report was issued andaccepted by the State of Hawai' i at some point during the construction. 
8
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
either or both of the parties on the date of the conclusion of
 
the evidentiary part of the trial (DOCOEPOT)." Malek v. Malek, 7
 
Haw. App. 377, 380, 768 P.2d 243, 246 (1989) (internal quotation
 marks, citation, and brackets in original omitted). The question
 in the instant case is whether the family court should have
 included in the marital estate Baker's commissions, which he
 earned in part or in whole during the marriage, but did not
 expect to receive until after the DOCOEPOT. The issue is a case
 of first impression in this jurisdiction.
 
In Teller, 99 Hawai
'i at 110-11, 53 P.3d at 249-50, the 
Hawai'i Supreme Court stated that in determining whether a party 
owned particular types of intangible property before or during a marriage, the vesting approach should be used. The supreme court held that whether a trade secret or patent vested before or during the marriage would determine whether they were separate or marital property. Id. In other cases, this court has held that 
regardless of when they vested, certain kinds of retirement benefits were part of the marital estate. In Stouffer v. Stouffer, 10 Haw. App. 267, 278, 867 P.2d 226, 231 (1994), we stated that a person is entitled to a portion of retirement benefits earned by his or her spouse during the marriage, even if the benefits are nonvested or vested but not mature at the time of divorce. We explained that in such cases, the family court usually awards the non-benefit-earning spouse a percentage of the retirement payments "if, as and when made." Id. at 277, 867 P.2d 
at 231. See also Linson v. Linson, 1 Haw. App. 272, 283, 618 
P.2d 748, 754 (1980) (holding that "federal law does not bar Hawaii family courts from considering and dividing husband's nonvested military retirement benefits as part of the estate of the parties under HRS § 580-47"). 
In still other cases, without considering vesting, we
 
determined whether intangible assets earned during the marriage,
 but receivable after divorce, were part of the marital estate. 
In Jones v. Jones, 7 Haw. App. 496, 499, 780 P.2d 581, 584
 (1989), we stated that "[a]n annuity for life earned during the
 marriage, but receivable post-divorce, is property divisible in a
 
9
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
divorce action." In Kuroda v. Kuroda, 87 Hawai 'i 419, 958 P.2d 
541 (App. 1998), we held that "the proceeds received or 
receivable by a partner from a third-party for tort injuries suffered during the marriage" should be included in the marital estate. Id. at 428, 958 P.2d at 550 (emphasis added). On the 
other hand, in Schiller, 120 Hawai
'i at 308, 205 P.3d at 573, we 
stated that "[i]nheritances a spouse expects to acquire after divorce are speculative, because the testator is free to change his will at any point in the future, and, "[l]ike other speculative assets which do not constitute property, they are not part of the divisible estate" in a divorce action. In Jones, we held that "disability pay is paid in lieu of and is akin to income that is earned and received post-divorce and is not property divisible in a divorce case." 7 Haw. App. at 500, 780 P.2d at 584. 
In the instant case, the family court apparently
 
declined to include the escrow commissions in the marital estate
 because they were too speculative since Baker would receive them
 post-divorce and the units were in a project that had not yet
 been constructed. However, as the authorities we cite to above
 reveal, whether a party is to acquire an asset after the DOCOEPOT
 alone is not dispositive. Further, although Baker testified that
 his other escrows had been cancelled because the units were in
 condominium projects with financial problems, in the record on
 appeal there is no evidence that his existing escrows were for
 units in projects with financial or other problems or any other
 evidence that those escrows might not close. Nothing in the
 record suggests that Baker had to perform any additional duties
 to receive his escrow commissions or do anything after the
 marriage was dissolved to earn those commissions. For these
 reasons, and because presumably Baker's expectancy was based on a
 contractual agreement, the escrow commissions in this case are
 unlike the husband's expectancy under his mother's will in
 Schiller. Also, because it is undisputed that the escrow
 commissions constitute "income" earned during the marriage, they
 are unlike the disability compensation discussed in Jones. We
 
10
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
are unpersuaded that the commissions were too speculative to be
 
included in the marital estate. 
The family court did not explicitly address Baker's
 
non-binding reservation agreements in the Decree, FOF/COL, or
 property division chart appended to the FOF/COL. For the same
 reasons we hold that the family court abused its discretion by
 omitting the escrow commissions from the marital estate, we hold
 that the court abused its discretion by excluding from the
 marital estate any commissions receivable by Baker on the non­binding reservation agreements.
 
Cases in other jurisdictions hold that commissions
 
earned during a marriage but receivable after the marriage's
 dissolution should be included in the marital estate. See, e.g.,
 
Ray v. Ray, 916 S.W.2d 469, 469-70 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1995) (holding
 that under Tennessee statute governing division of property upon
 divorce, husband's contract as insurance agent entitling him to
 commissions on premiums paid were properly considered part of
 marital estate, regardless of when they vested); Freeman v.
 Freeman, 457 S.E.2d 3, 5 (S.C. Ct. App. 1995) (holding that
 renewal commissions on insurance policies sold by spouse during
 marriage, but paid after dissolution of marriage, were marital
 property subject to equitable distribution); Hartland v.
 Hartland, 777 P.2d 636, 643 (Alaska 1989) (holding that
 stockbroker husband's deferred commissions should be considered
 marital property, even though husband would not receive them
 until after dissolution of marriage); Niroo v. Niroo, 545 A.2d
 35, 39 (Md. 1988) (holding that contractually vested rights in
 renewal commissions on insurance policies sold by husband during
 marriage, but accruing after dissolution of marriage, were
 marital property); In re Marriage of Johnson, 576 P.2d 188, 191
 (Colo. App. 1977) (holding that husband's rights to real estate
 commissions that arose prior to dissolution of marriage hearing,
 but which he would not acquire until after property division
 hearing, constituted marital property subject to division).
 
Given the foregoing, the family court abused its
 
discretion by not characterizing Baker's commissions as marital
 
11
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
property, subject to division, and FOF 140 is clearly erroneous. 
COL 6 is wrong insofar as it relates to Baker's commissions.
2. Equalization
 
Bielski contends the family court either failed to
 
equalize or erroneously equalized the parties' assets and debts. 
Related to this argument is Bielski's contention that COL 6 is
 wrong.
 
a. Failure to rely on property division chart
 
Bielski argues that the family court apparently failed
 
to rely on a property division chart when it divided the parties'
 assets and debts because the court did not attach such a chart to
 its Decree. She infers from the chart's absence that the family
 court did not have a reasonable means of determining the asset
 and debt division. The family court did not attach a property
 division chart to its Decree, but did attach one to its later-
filed FOF/COL.
 
The family court does not explain why it attached the
 
property division chart only to the FOF/COL or cited to the chart
 in its FOF/COL, or state whether it considered the chart when
 dividing the parties' assets and debts. The Decree was filed on
 July 31, 2007, and the property division chart indicates it was
 prepared by Baker's attorney, Donna Davis Green (Green), on
 October 31, 2007, and received by the family court on November 1,
 2007. Therefore, it would appear that the family court did not
 rely on that particular version of the chart when it issued its
 Decree. On the other hand, we fail to see why the family court
 would attach the chart to the FOF/COL where the court states that
 it "applied the law of equitable distribution," except to suggest
 that the court referred to some version of that chart or another
 similar chart when dividing the parties' property.
 
Bielski cites to no authority to support her argument 
that the family court was required to attach a property division chart to its Decree, no evidence that the court did not have a reasonable means of determining the asset and debt division, and no discrepancy between the FOF/COL and the Decree. She cites to Wintermeyer v. Wintermeyer, 114 Hawai
'i 96, 99, 157 P.3d 535, 538 
12
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(App. 2006), to support this point; however, there, this court
 
merely observed that the Family Court of the Second Circuit had
 appended an incomplete property division chart to its findings of
 facts and conclusions of law. 
b. Failure to equalize properly
 
Bielski argues that even if the family court relied on
 
a property division chart, the court improperly equalized the
 parties' assets and debts.
i.	 Failure to split each asset and debt
equally
 
Bielski maintains the family court erroneously failed 
to "literally award each party one-half of each and every asset 
and debt." She cites to Helbush v. Helbush, 108 Hawai
'i 508, 122 
P.3d 288 (App. 2005), in which we stated that "partnership principles dictate an equal division of the marital estate where the only facts proved are the marriage itself and the existence of jointly owned property." Id. at 513, 122 P.3d at 293 
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
"[T]he division and distribution of property pursuant 
to a divorce need not be equal but should be just and equitable." Teller, 99 Hawai
'i at 107, 53 P.3d at 246. As we have 
consistently observed, "the family court has broad discretion to divide and distribute the estate of the parties in a just and equitable manner. As such, the family court assesses and weighs all valid and relevant considerations to exercise its equitable discretion in distributing marital property." Booth v. Booth, 90 
Hawai
'i 413, 417, 978 P.2d 851, 855 (App. 1999) (internal 
quotation marks and citations omitted). 
The portion of Helbush to which Bielski cites is
 
inapplicable because here, the marriage itself and the existence
 of jointly owned property were not the only facts proved. Hence,
 the family court was not required to divide each asset and debt
 equally, and the court properly equalized the property based on
 
13
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
numerous, undisputed FOFs regarding the circumstances of the
 
marriage pursuant to HRS § 580-47.6
 
ii. Baker's 2006 income taxes
 
Bielski argues that in equalizing the parties' assets
 
and debts, the family court erroneously included in the
 calculation an amount owed in 2006 income taxes after the court
 had ruled that Baker was to be solely responsible for the debt. 
The Decree provides: "The parties filed separate tax returns for
 calendar year 2006, even though they lived together for the first
 five months. [Baker] has agreed to be fully responsible for any
 tax consequence for the tax year 2006." FOF 107 in the FOF/COL
 provides that Baker did not seek any contribution from Bielski
 for the taxes he owed in 2006. FOF 160 provides that Baker
 "assumed . . . the $20,000.00 plus debt that would be due and
 owing to the IRS and State of Hawaii for [sic] 2006 tax return."
 
In the portion of the property division chart entitled
 
"Part A: Proposed Division of Existing Assets and Debts" (Part
 A), the assets and debts of the marital estate, Baker, and
 Bielski are totaled. Part A attributes to Baker $18,263 owed in
 federal taxes and $3,492 owed in state taxes for 2006. Also
 assigned to Baker is partnership debt, including some credit card
 debt, which he voluntarily assumed. In the chart, after the
 parties' respective partnership profits and losses are added
 together, an equalization payment is applied to the totals. The
 equalization payment represents the value transferred from
 Bielski's share of the total partnership profits and losses to
 Baker's share to ensure the parties receive a similar amount of
 total value from the marital estate.
 
In neither the Decree nor the FOF/COL did the family
 
court state it would omit the tax debt from the equalization
 calculation, and there is no indication in the record on appeal
 that when Baker volunteered to assume the debt, he meant to
 
6
 HRS § 580-47(a) provides that when "finally dividing and distributing
the estate of the parties," "the court shall take into consideration: the
 
respective merits of the parties, the relative abilities of the parties, the
condition in which each party will be left by the divorce, the burdens imposed
upon either party for the benefit of the children of the parties, and all
other circumstances of the case."
 
14
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
remove it from the calculation. The tax debt is not Baker's 
separate property because it was acquired during the marriage. Given the family court's "broad discretion to divide and distribute the estate of the parties in a just and equitable manner," Booth, 90 Hawai
'i at 417, 978 P.2d at 855 (internal 
quotation marks and citation omitted), the family court did not err by including the tax debt in the equalization calculation.
iii. Credit card debts
 
Bielski argues that the family court failed to mention
 
in the Decree three partnership debts included in the property
 division chart: $21,000 owed on a United Visa credit card, $900
 owed on a Pier 1 credit card, and $10,000 owed on a Bank of
 America Visa credit card (collectively, the credit card debt). 
Bielski maintains the family court's failure to mention these
 debts in the Decree reveals that the court did not equalize all
 of the marital partnership property.
 
FOF 127 in the FOF/COL provides that Baker "agreed to
 
pay all of the debts listed on page 3 of his Asset and Debt
 Statement in the total amount of $48,830.53, with the exception
 of the Discover Card." (Footnote omitted.) Page three of
 Baker's Asset and Debt Statement (Baker's Trial Exhibit 54)
 includes the debts owed on the credit cards. FOF 160 provides
 that Baker "assumed all other marital debt," besides the amount
 due and owing on the Discover Card. The Decree does not
 specifically mention the credit card debts.
 
Bielski provides no authority for her argument that the
 
family court was required to refer in the Decree to marital debt
 Baker voluntarily assumed, including the credit card debt. 
Bielski cites to no evidence in the record that the family court
 failed to consider the credit card debt when issuing its Decree,
 and, in fact, the listing of the debt in the property division
 chart suggests the court did consider it.
iv. Attorney's fees
 
Bielski argues as follows that the family court
 
erroneously failed to include her attorney's fees in the
 equalization:
 
15
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
The [family] court included the attorney's fees debts
that [Baker] was responsible for (Coates & Frey and Law
Offices of Donna Davis Greene) in said property division
chart and the Decree. In contrast, the [family] court did
not include [Bielski's] attorney's fees and costs in said
property division chart despite the fact that her former
counsel (Richard Diehl, Esq.) was granted a charging lien
against [Bielski's] share of the marital assets in the
amount of $6,200.77, on July 5, 2007 (four days before the
first day of trial). Furthermore, said Decree's provision
that, "[e]ach party shall be responsible for their own
attorney's fees," is not clear on whether the [family] court
considered said debts not to be marital debts. The parties'
respective attorney's fees debts are marital debts, having
been incurred prior to the [DOCOEPOT]. As marital and debts
 [sic], they should have been subject to equalization by the
[family] court.
 
(Record references omitted.)
 
The Decree provides in relevant part:
 
Each party shall be responsible for their own
attorney's fees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, [Baker]
shall pay, as and for [Bielski's] attorney's fees, $2,500.00
from the sale proceeds of one of the marital properties.
Escrow shall be instructed to cut a check directly to Coats
& Frey for such sum.
 
FOF 49 provides that "[o]n December 14, 2006, [Bielski] filed a
 
second Motion and Affidavit for Pre Decree Relief requesting
 $3,000.00 in legal fees to fund [Bielski's] ongoing formal
 discovery[.]" FOF 52 states that the family court ordered that a
 one-time payment towards Bielski's legal fees in the amount of
 $2,500 be made, "but no more thereafter." FOF 161 provides that
 Baker had been ordered to pay $2,500 in Bielski's attorney's fees
 "pursuant to a prior court order."
 
On June 28, 2007, Richard J. Diehl (Diehl), Bielski's
 
attorney who had withdrawn from representing her in the divorce,
 filed a motion for a charging lien. At the hearing on the
 motion, Diehl requested a lien in the amount of $6,200.77 against
 the marital estate. The family court filed an order granting the
 motion. On September 7, 2007, Diehl filed a motion for an
 additional charging lien in the amount of $15,000. At the
 September 13, 2007 hearing on the motion, Diehl requested that
 the lien be on real property the parties owned in Hawai
'i (Hawai 'i 
property), which, pursuant to the Decree, was to be sold and the
 proceeds divided between the parties. The family court filed an
 order granting the motion. FOF 129 in the FOF/COL provides that
 
16

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Bielski "paid $15,000.00 to her second attorney, [Diehl] for
 
legal representation."7
 
In the property division chart, the $2,500 debt is 
assigned to Baker, as well as an amount of money he owed Green (his attorney) in the amount of $14,430.53. Nowhere in the Decree or the FOF/COL did the family court mention Diehl's charging lien on the Hawai
'i property, and the lien is not 
included in the property division chart. Given the complete absence of any evidence that the family court considered the lien when it equalized the parties' assets and debts, we infer that the court erroneously omitted the lien from its equalization calculation. 
v. Result
 
To the extent that it relates to Diehl's charging lien,
 
COL 6 is wrong.
3. Valuation of Burnet Property
 
Bielski contends the family court erred in awarding
 
Baker pre-marital contribution credit for the value of the Burnet
 Property, which Baker purchased three years prior to the date of
 marriage (DOM) and sold during the marriage. She maintains that
 three years prior to the DOM was too remote in time from when the
 family court divided the property to form an accurate basis for
 the court's valuation. Related to this argument is Bielski's
 contention that FOFs 5 and 156.A are clearly erroneous and COLs
 10 and 15 are wrong.
 
FOF 5 provides:
 
5. On April 22, 1991, [Baker], prior to meeting
[Bielski], purchased [the Burnet Property] for $179,900.00. 
On July 19, 1994, prior to the parties' marriage, the terms
of the [Burnet Property's] mortgage were amended to reflect
that the debt due and owing on the property was $126,126.01.
 
(Footnotes omitted.)
 
FOF 156.A provides:
 
A. [Baker] was awarded his Category 1 capital
contribution from his the [sic] sale of his Canadian pre­marital property [the Burnet Property] in the amount of
 
7
 FOF 126.E in the FOF/COL provides that Bielski "presented no
testimony or other evidence verifying or establishing an attorney debt of
$18,000.00." However, after an exhaustive review of the record on appeal, we
cannot determine to what the $18,000 refers.
 
17
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
$53,774.00. One-half of that reimbursement ($26,887.00) was
to be paid from the sales proceeds of each of the parties'
properties upon closing.
 
COL 10 provides:
 
10. It was just and equitable for the court to award
[Baker] the return of his Category 1 capital contribution of
$53,774 accrued from the sale of a house in Canada prior to
the parties' marriage. This amount constituted [Baker's]
"investment into the marital economic partnership."
 
COL 15 provides:
 
15. The court further exercised its discretion
 
properly in measuring the condition each party would be left
in as a result of the divorce by ordering that the return of
[Baker's] Category 1 contribution and fifty percent of
[Bielski's] portion of the Discover Card debt not be taken
out of the equity from just one of the sales proceeds of the
parties' properties, but rather to be split between the
equity of both the Honolulu and Canadian properties. HRS
 § 580-47(a).
 
At trial, Baker testified that he wanted the family
 
court to award him the value of the Burnet Property's equity
 
prior to the marriage as his Premarital Separate Property. Baker
 testified that he based his valuation of the Burnet Property on
 the price he paid for it in 1991 ($179,900), not the amount he
 later sold it for in 1994 ($217,000). Baker stated that Exhibit
 47 was a tax roll for the Burnet Property. The exhibit showed
 that the balance on the mortgage on July 19, 1994, or three weeks
 before the DOM on August 15 of that year, was $126,126.01. 
Subtracting the outstanding mortgage amount from the property's
 1991 purchase price, Baker estimated that the property's equity
 prior to the marriage was approximately $53,774. He testified
 that he used the proceeds from the sale of the Burnet Property in
 1999 to purchase the Queen's Quay property in Canada.
 
When dividing and distributing the value of the
property of the parties in a divorce case, the relevant
value is, as a general rule, the fair market value (FMV) of
the parties' interest therein on the relevant date. We
 define the FMV as being the amount at which an item would
change hands from a willing seller to a willing buyer,
neither being under any compulsion to buy or sell and both
having reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts.
 
Antolik v. Harvey, 7 Haw. App. 313, 318-19, 761 P.2d 305, 309
 
(1988). In Helbush, 108 Hawai 'i at 512, 122 P.3d at 292, we 
stated that Category 1 property is the "property separately owned
 
18
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
by one spouse on the [DOM]."8 The NMVs in Category 1 represent 
"the parties' capital contributions to the marital partnership." 
Id. (quoting Gardner v. Gardner, 8 Haw. App. 461, 466, 810 P.2d 239, 242 (1991)). "Under general partnership law, 'each partner is entitled to be repaid his contributions to the partnership property, whether made by way of capital or advances.' 59 Am. Jur. 2d Partnership § 476 (1987)[.]" Helbush, 108 Hawai
'i at 
513, 122 P.3d at 293 (quoting Gardner, 8 Haw. App. at 464, 810 P.2d at 242). "Category 1 . . . NMVs are the 'partner's contributions' to the Marital Partnership Property that, assuming all valid and relevant considerations are equal, are repaid to the contributing spouse[.]" Helbush, 108 Hawai
'i at 513, 122 
P.3d at 293 (quoting Hussey v. Hussey, 77 Hawai 'i 202, 207, 881 
P.2d 1270, 1275 (App. 1994)). 
To the extent we can understand her argument, Bielski
 
maintains the family court erroneously accepted Baker's valuation
 of the Burnet Property at the time he purchased it three years
 prior to the DOM, which was too remote in time from when the
 court divided the property to form the basis for an accurate
 
8
 In Helbush, we explained that Category 1 is one of five categories of
 
NMVs the family court can utilize when dividing property in divorce cases:
 
Category 1. The [NMV], plus or minus, of all property separately
owned by one spouse on the [DOM] but excluding the NMV
attributable to property that is subsequently legally gifted by
the owner to the other spouse, to both spouses, or to a third
party.
 
Category 2. The increase in the NMV of all property whose NMV on
the DOM is included in category 1 and that the owner separately
owns continuously from the DOM to the DOCOEPOT[.]
 
Category 3. The date-of-acquisition NMV, plus or minus, of
property separately acquired by gift or inheritance during the
marriage but excluding the NMV attributable to property that is
subsequently legally gifted by the owner to the other spouse, to
both spouses, or to a third party.
 
Category 4. The increase in the NMV of all property whose NMV on
the date of acquisition during the marriage is included in
category 3 and that the owner separately owns continuously from
the date of acquisition to the DOCOEPOT.
 
Category 5. The difference between the NMVs, plus or minus, of all
property owned by one or both of the spouses on the DOCOEPOT minus
the NMVs, plus or minus, includable in categories 1, 2, 3, and 4.
 
108 Hawai' i at 512, 122 P.3d at 292 (quoting Malek v. Malek, 7 Haw. App. 377,
380 n.1, 768 P.2d 243, 246 n.1 (1989)). 
19
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
valuation. Bielski provides no authority for this argument, and
 
we find none. Baker's calculation that the property's equity
 prior to the marriage was $53,774 was based on the 1991 purchase
 price of the property minus the outstanding mortgage amount on
 the DOM, which price clearly represented the amount at which the
 item changed hands from "a willing seller to a willing buyer." 
Antolik, 7 Haw. App. at 319, 761 P.2d at 309. The family court
 did not abuse its discretion by crediting Baker with his capital
 contribution toward the Burnet Property or accepting Baker's
 valuation of the property's equity prior to the DOM. FOFs 5 and
 156.A are not clearly erroneous, and COLs 10 and 15 are not
 wrong. 
B. EXHIBIT 47
 
At trial, on direct examination, Baker's counsel asked
 
Baker to refer to Exhibit 47. Bielski objected to the
 introduction of the evidence because it was "just like something
 you can print off the Internet. . . . [T]his is not an official
 document[.]" Baker's counsel stated that the evidence was
 offered to prove Baker's Category 1 contribution to the Burnet
 Property, and the exhibit was similar to what one would find when
 looking up property tax information on the internet. The family
 court stated, "Well, you haven't moved it into evidence yet,
 [Baker's] just testifying" and "So go ahead and testify about
 it." Baker testified the exhibit was tax documentation for the
 Burnet Property that stated the property's purchase price,
 balance owing before the parties' marriage, and other
 information. The family court then received Exhibit 47 into
 evidence over Bielski's objection.
1. Admission of Exhibit 47
 
Bielski contends the family court erred by admitting
 
into evidence Exhibit 47, which constituted hearsay without
 exception because it was made by third parties and the family
 court did not rule that the exhibit was trustworthy. "'Hearsay'
 is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while
 testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove
 the truth of the matter asserted." Hawaii Rules of Evidence
 
20
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(HRE) Rule 801. Hearsay is not admissible, unless it falls under
 
a hearsay exception. HRE Rules 802, 802.1, 803, and 804.
 
The Hawai 'i Supreme Court has recognized that competent 
evidence of value must support the family court's division of property. Booth, 90 Hawai
'i at 416, 978 P.2d at 854 (citing to 
In re Marriage of Aud, 491 N.E.2d 894, 898 (Ill. 1986)). However, a party's failure to provide the court with evidence of market value leaves the court discretion to review the full record to determine an equitable value. Teller, 99 Hawai
'i at 
115, 53 P.3d at 254. In addition, the supreme court has acknowledged that when a party offers no evidence of an asset's value, the party cannot complain about a court's disposition of the asset. Booth, 90 Hawai
'i at 416, 978 P.2d at 854 (citing to 
In re Marriage of Tyrrell, 477 N.E.2d 523, 524 (1985)). 
In the instant case, Bielski provided no evidence of 
the Burnet Property's value, and so is precluded from complaining about its disposition. Booth, 90 Hawai
'i at 416, 978 P.2d at 
854. Further, without addressing whether the family court 
properly admitted Exhibit 47 into evidence, any error on the part of the family court was harmless because Baker had personal knowledge of the price he paid for the Burnet Property and the outstanding mortgage balance prior to the DOM without reference to the exhibit and Baker's testimony on these matters would have comprised the only evidence presented at trial regarding the property's value at DOM. Teller, 99 Hawai
'i at 115, 53 P.3d at 
254. The family court did not err by crediting to Baker the
 
value of his capital contribution to the Burnet Property as his
 Category 1 Marital Separate Property.
 
Bielski argues that the family court plainly erred by
 
allowing Baker to testify regarding Exhibit 47 before it was
 admitted into evidence. Bielski concedes she did not object on
 this ground. Given our holding that any error in admitting
 Exhibit 47 was harmless, we find no plain error.
