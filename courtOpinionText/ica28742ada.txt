APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT

SEPTEMBER 28, 2010

 
NAKAMURA, C.J., FOLEY AND FUJISE, JJ.
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY FUJISE, J.
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Gary Suzuki (Suzuki) appeals from
 
the August 15, 2007 judgment of the Circuit Court of the Second
 
1
Circuit  (circuit court) in favor of Defendant-Appellee Castle &
Cooke Resorts (Appellee) on Suzuki's personal injury claim. The 
sole issue on appeal is whether Appellee was immune from suit 
under the exclusive remedy provision of Hawai 'i's workers' 
compensation law given that Suzuki had received workers' compensation benefits from a joint insurance policy held by 
Appellee's parent company, Castle & Cooke, Inc. (Castle & Cooke). 
We conclude that the circuit court erred in granting summary 
judgment to Appellee because Appellee had not demonstrated that 
it was immune from suit and was therefore entitled to judgment as 
a matter of law. 
The essential facts of this case are not disputed. 

Suzuki was doing masonry work on the concrete driveway at the

  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
home of David Murdock, chief executive officer of Castle & Cooke,
 
when the brakes of a parked truck, owned by Appellee, failed,
 
causing the truck to roll down the driveway and strike Suzuki. 
As a result, Suzuki suffered injuries requiring surgery and
 
rehabilitative therapy.
 
At the time of the accident, Suzuki was employed by
 
Lanai Builders, a wholly owned subsidiary of Appellee, which was,
 
in turn, wholly owned by Castle & Cooke. The State Department of
 
Labor and Industrial Relations, under the authority of Hawaii
 
Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 386-193 and -194, certified Castle &
 
Cooke to self-insure its workers' compensation benefits plans. 
Castle & Cooke provided workers' compensation coverage for nine
 
related companies, including Appellee and Lanai Builders. 
Suzuki received benefits for his injuries through Castle &
 
Cooke's self-insured workers' compensation program.
 
On June 20, 2006, Suzuki filed the underlying complaint
 
against Appellee, alleging that the company was negligent in
 
maintaining the truck and otherwise negligent in operating the
 
vehicle. On June 12, 2007, Appellee filed a "Motion to Dismiss
 
for Failure to State a Claim and/or Motion for Summary
 
Judgment."2 In a memorandum in support of the motion, Appellee
 
conceded, among other things, that it breached its duty to
 maintain, repair, and inspect the truck that struck Suzuki and to
 
adopt policies concerning parking the vehicle.
 
In claiming immunity from suit, Appellee relied upon 
the exclusive remedy provision in Hawai
'i's workers' compensation 
law. This provision states: 
2
 The circuit court granted Appellee's motion but did not specify
whether it was dismissing the complaint or granting summary judgment in
Appellee's favor. For purposes of review, we treat the motion as one forsummary judgment under Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 56, not a
dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), because the circuit court was presented withmatters outside of the pleadings that it did not exclude when issuing itsdecision. See Sierra Club v. Dep't of Transp., 115 Hawai' i 299, 312-13, 167
P.3d 292, 305-06 (2007). The circuit court's award of summary judgment isreviewed de novo. Frank v. Hawaii Planning Mill Found., 88 Hawai' i 140, 144,

937 P.2d 397, 406 (1997)).

The rights and remedies herein granted to an employee or the
employee's dependents on account of a work injury suffered
by the employee shall exclude all other liability of the
employer to the employee, the employee's legal
representative, spouse, dependents, next of kin, or anyone
else entitled to recover damages from the employer, at
common law or otherwise, on account of the injury, except
for sexual harassment or sexual assault and infliction of
 emotional distress or invasion of privacy related thereto,
in which case a civil action may also be brought.
 
HRS § 386-5 (1993). Appellee also cites to Frank for the
 
proposition that "the company that secured the workers'
 
compensation coverage in accordance with the statutory
 
requirements was entitled to tort immunity as the statutory
 
employer."
 
In Frank, a case involving a loaned or borrowed 
employee, the Hawai 'i Supreme Court adopted a three-prong test in 
evaluating whether an entity was a "statutory employer" for workers' compensation purposes. A business must show that "(1) a 
contract of hire, express or implied, existed between [the 
plaintiff and business]; (2) the work being done was essentially 
that of the statutory employer; and (3) the statutory employer 
had the right to control the details of the work." Id., 88 
Hawai
'i at 146 n.6, 963 P.2d at 355 n.6 (citing Ghersi v. 
Salazar, 883 P.2d 1352, 1356-57 (Utah 1994) (quoting 1B Arthur 
Larson, Workmen's Compensation Law § 48.00, at 8-434 (1992))). 
In this case, Appellee failed to produce evidence
 
establishing that this test was met. Indeed, the record reveals
 
the parties disputed at least two material facts: whose work was
 
being done by Suzuki when he was injured and who controlled
 
Suzuki's work at the job site. Therefore, it cannot be said that
 
Appellee proved it was Suzuki's statutory employer. 
When a party fails to prove that it is a worker's
 
statutory employer, the question remains whether the party is the
 
worker's actual employer. See Lane v. Kingsport Armature &
 
Elec., 676 F. Supp. 108, 110-11 (W.D. Va. 1988) (examining first
 whether the defendant was the "statutory employer" under Virginia
 
law, then whether the defendant could be considered the "actual
 
3
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
employer"). The test for determining whether an employer-
employee relationship exists for purposes of Hawai 'i's workers' 
compensation laws is the "control test." Locations, Inc. v. 
Hawai'i Dept. of Labor & Indus. Relations, 79 Hawai 'i 208, 212-13, 
900 P.2d 784, 788-89 (1995) (citing Yoshino v. Saga Food Serv., 59 Haw. 139, 143, 577 P.2d 787, 790 (1978)). "Under the control 
test, an employment relationship is established when 'the person 
in whose behalf the work is done has the power, express or 
implied, to dictate the means and methods by which the work is to 
be accomplished.'" Id., 79 Hawai
'i at 211, 900 P.2d at 787 
(quoting Tomondong v. Ikezaki, 32 Haw. 373, 380 (1932)).
 Appellee states that the "CEO for CASTLE & COOKE[],
 
David H. Murdock, and/or his subordinates requested that LANAI
 BUILDERS build and install the concrete driveway" where Suzuki
 
was injured. Appellee later contends that Suzuki was working for
 
Lanai Builders, Appellee, and Castle & Cooke, so Appellee
 
"presumably had the right to control the details of the work." 
However, Appellee also submitted Suzuki's deposition, wherein
 
Suzuki testified that he received his paycheck from Lanai
 
Builders, he was working with other Lanai Builders employees on
 
the day of the accident, and he had been hired by Lanai Builders. 
Accordingly, there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding
 
who controlled Suzuki's work. As such, Appellee did not
 
establish that it was undisputedly Suzuki's actual employer.
 
Even if Appellee was unable to prove that it was
 
Suzuki's statutory or actual employer, it would be entitled to
 
the immunity of Lanai Builders if, as it claims, the companies
 
"are so completely integrated and commingled that [Suzuki] could
 
not realistically view them as separate entities." By this
 
argument, Appellee has put itself in the unusual position of a
 
parent corporation arguing that its subsidiary's separate status
 
should be disregarded.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawai'i courts are generally reluctant to disregard the 
corporate entity. Robert's Hawaii School Bus, Inc. v. 
Laupahoehoe Transp. Co., 91 Hawai 'i 224, 241 n.12, 982 P.2d 853, 
870 n.12 (1999), superceded by statute on other grounds as noted 
in Davis v. Four Seasons Hotel Ltd., 122 Hawai 'i 423, 428 n.9, 
228 P.3d 303, 308 n.9 (2010). In fact, the Hawai 'i Supreme Court 
has said "the legal entity of the corporation will be disregarded 
only where recognition of the corporate fiction would bring about 
injustice and inequity or when there is evidence that the 
corporate fiction has been used to perpetrate a fraud or defeat a 
rightful claim." Chung v. Animal Clinic, Inc., 63 Haw. 642, 645, 
636 P.2d 721, 723 (1981) (citations omitted). Appellee does not argue that such circumstances exist here. 
In Michigan, the jurisdiction predominately cited by
 
Appellee for support, the state supreme court acknowledged that
 
although piercing the corporate veil was a tactic typically
 
employed against corporate defendants, public policy justified
 
its use for their benefit as well. The court reasoned:
 
The statutory workers' compensation scheme was enacted
for the protection of both employees and employers who work
and do business in this state. The system assures covered
employees that they will be compensated in the event of
employment-related injuries. In addition, employers are
assured of the parameters of their liability for such
injuries. By agreeing to assume responsibility for all
employment-related injuries, employers protect themselves
from the possibility of potentially excessive damage awards.
In order to effectuate these policies, the statute has been
liberally construed to provide broad coverage for injured
workers.
 
If the statute is to be construed liberally when an
employee seeks benefits, it should not be construed
differently when the employer asserts it as a defense to a
tort action brought by the employee who claimed and accepted
benefits arising from that employment relationship.
 
3(...continued)
is the plaintiff that is trying to "pierce the
corporate veil." But here the positions are reversed.
The parent strives to disavow its separateness so as
to assume identity with its subsidiary and thus share
its immunity as employer."
 
10 Larson's Workers' Compensation § 112.01, at 112-2 (Matthew Bender rev. ed.
2010).

Wells v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co., 364 N.W.2d 670, 674-75
 
(Mich. 1984) (citation omitted).
 
Michigan's position is anomalous, however, to the
 
general view that a separate corporate identity, once created,
 
should be kept in place when applying workers' compensation
 
exclusive remedy laws. See Volb v. GE Capital Corp., 651 A.2d
 
1002, 1008-09 (N.J. 1995) (listing courts that refuse to disturb
 the corporate distinction between parent and subsidiary at the
 
request of defendants claiming immunity); see also Wells, 364
 
N.W.2d at 677 (Levin, J., dissenting) ("The vast majority of
 
states do not extend the reach of the exclusive remedy provision
 
of a workers' compensation act by treating parent and subsidiary
 
corporations as a single entity."). A parent company's attempt
 
to reverse-pierce the corporate veil "makes it vulnerable to the
 
argument that the parent, having deliberately set up the
 
corporate separateness for its own purposes, should not be heard
 
to disavow that separateness when it happens to be to its
 
advantage to do so." 10 Larson's Workers' Compensation Laws
 
§ 112.01, at 112-2 (Matthew Bender rev. ed. 2010) The Sixth
 
Circuit, refusing to pierce the veil for a corporate defendant,
 
explained further:
 
[A] business enterprise has a range of choice in controlling
its own corporate structure. But reciprocal obligations
arise as a result of the choice it makes. The owners may
take advantage of the benefits of dividing the business into
separate corporate parts, but principles of reciprocity
require that courts also recognize the separate identities
of the enterprises when sued by an injured employee.
 
Boggs v. Blue Diamond Coal Co., 590 F.2d 655, 662 (6th Cir.
 
1979). The unwillingness to reverse-pierce the corporate veil is
 
particularly strong where, as is the case here, "the parent's
 
liability as a separate entity arises under customary principles
 
of common law and is not derivative liability based on the
 
negligence of the subsidiary." 1 Fletcher Cyc. Corp. § 43.50
 
(Rev. ed. 2006).
 
Hawai'i uses the alter ego test before determining 
whether the corporate veil should be pierced. Robert's Hawaii 
6
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
School Bus, Inc., 91 Hawai 'i at 241, 982 P.2d at 870. The Hawai 'i 
Supreme Court has listed more than twenty factors to evaluate 
whether one entity is another's alter ego, among them whether the 
companies commingled funds, employed the same people, have 
identical ownership, or have shared directors and officers with 
supervisory or managerial responsibilities over both companies. 
Id., at 241-43, 982 P.2d at 870-72 (citing Associated Vendors, 
Inc. v. Oakland Meat Co., 26 Cal. Rptr. 806, 813 (Cal. Dist. Ct. 
App. 1962)). "Ultimately, no one factor is dispositive." Id., 
91 Hawai 'i at 243, 982 P.2d at 872.
 Although Appellee asserts there is complete
 
integration between Castle & Cooke, Appellee, and Lanai Builders,
 the circuit court made no finding that Appellee was Lanai
 
Builders' alter ego. Appellee notes the fact that Appellee is
 
the sole stockholder of Lanai Builders and that the companies'
 
financial statements are consolidated for reporting and auditing
 
purposes. There is, however, no evidence of shared management or
 
directors. From the scant evidence presented by Appellee we
 
cannot conclude that there is no dispute regarding whether
 
Appellee is the alter ego of Lanai Builders.
 
Furthermore, the shared workers' compensation insurance
 
policy between Castle & Cooke and its subsidiaries is
 
insufficient to establish Appellee as Lanai Builders' alter ego. 
Appellee does not cite, nor could we find, any jurisdiction that
 
extends a subsidiary's tort immunity to the parent company solely
 
based on a shared workers' compensation insurance plan. While
 
some courts view a shared workers' compensation plan as a
 
persuasive factor in determining that a parent and subsidiary
 
should be treated as one entity, Wheeler v. Couret, 182
 
F. Supp. 2d 330, 334 (S.D.N.Y. 2001), Verhaar v. Consumers Power
 
Co., 446 N.W.2d 299, 300 (Mich. Ct. App. 1989), others have said
 
that shared workers' compensation coverage "has little, if any,
 
relevance to the issue of whether the parent corporation is the
 
subsidiary corporation worker's employer." Stoddard v.
 
Ling-Temco-Vought, Inc., 513 F. Supp. 314, 326 (C.D. Cal. 1980)

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(citing O'Brien v. Grumman Corp., 475 F. Supp. 284, 292 (S.D.N.Y.
 
1979) and Latham v. Technar, Inc., 390 F. Supp. 1031 (E.D. Tenn.
 
1974)). The Florida Supreme Court reasoned that "[t]he decision
 
of a parent to include a subsidiary within a joint [workers']
 
compensation policy is usually an economic one[,]" but the
 
state's legislature did not intend for such policies to limit
 
third-party tort liability. Gulfstream Land & Dev. Corp. v.
 
Wilkerson, 420 So.2d 587, 589 (Fla. 1982), superceded by statute
 as noted in Ostuni v. Meineke Disc. Muffler Shops, Inc., 948
 
So.2d 848 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2007). While a shared insurance
 
policy may contribute to the finding that a parent corporation is
 
the alter ego of its subsidiary, it is not conclusive.
 
The circuit court therefore erred in granting summary
 
judgment. The August 15, 2007 judgment of the Circuit Court of
 
the Second Circuit in Appellee's favor is vacated and remanded
 
for further proceedings.
