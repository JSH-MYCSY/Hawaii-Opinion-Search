NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of Hawai 'i Department of Business, Economic Development and 
Tourism, formerly Department of Planning and Economic Development 
(State) on Counts I-VI of the State's Amended Counterclaim, 
pursuant to Hawai 'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 54(b). 
On this appeal, Plaintiffs contend that their breach of
 
contract claim against the State was not barred by the applicable
 
two-year statute of limitations. Plaintiffs and Oceanic Libra
 
also contend, generally, that the State should not have prevailed
 
on its counterclaims because the State breached the terms of the
 
operative loan documents. In their points of error, Appellants
 
challenge Finding of Fact (FOF) No. 29 and Conclusions of Law
 
(COL) Nos. 5, 6, 7, and 8 of the Circuit Court's March 7, 2007
 
FOFs and COLs entered after the trial on the State's
 
counterclaims:
 
FINDINGS OF FACT
 
. . . .
 
29. As of March 14, 2006, the outstanding balance
owing on Loan 28 included $560,000.00 in principal;
$741,183.33 in interest; and $979.00 in care and maintenance
 expenses. Per diem interest on Loan 28 is $116.67. As of
 March 14, 2006, the outstanding balance owing on Loan 61
included $166,000.00 in principal; $127,059.17 in interest;
and $971.00 in care and maintenance expenses. Per diem
 interest on Loan 61 is $34.58.
 
. . . .
 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
 
. . . .
 5. OKC and the Ohais accepted the State's offer to
loan the stated sums, originally requested by the Ohais, on
certain terms. The objective intent of the parties was to
form contracts based upon the loan authorizations and
agreements, notes, mortgages, guarantees, and modifications.
The parties agreed to all material terms. Based upon the
credible circumstances and reasonable inferences to be drawn
 therefrom, the Court must conclude that a term to which all
parties objectively intended to agree as to both loans was
that OKC and/or the Ohais would make periodic interest-only
payments upon disbursed principal.
6. The question [of] whether a written contract was
intended to be fully integrated, integrated as to a term, as
a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the
agreement, or not, is an initial question for the trier of
fact. Restatement (second) of contracts (hereinafter,
"Restatement"), section 209. It may be decided based upon
all relevant evidence and the circumstances bearing upon the
intention of the parties; the inclusion of such a term
declaring the written document to be a full integration is
but one part of the evidence. Restatement, sections 209 and
 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
210. The credible evidence establishes that the parties did
not intend that the Loan 28 documents would constitute a
 
completely integrated agreement.
7. Although documents for both Loans 28 and 61
required disbursements in the discretion of the State to be
made within 12 months of signing of those documents, the
Ohais' requested added disbursements thereunder beyond the
12-month periods, agreeing to repay any additional funds in
accordance with the terms of Loans 28 and 61. The State
 agreed, foregoing any right to cease further disbursements.
By so agreeing, the parties objectively agreed to extend the
original loans.
8. The counterclaim defendants breached the
 
contracts and guarantees by not paying sums when due
and owing. Furthermore, Leo and Virginia Ohai are in
breach for assigning the Nuuanu Avenue apartment
without having obtained the State's consent or
agreement.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Appellants' contentions as follows:
 
(1) We do not have appellate jurisdiction over the 
Circuit Court's rulings on Plaintiffs' breach of contract claim 
against the State because the September 30, 2004 Judgment is not 
an independently appealable order or judgment under Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2009). HRS 
§ 641-1(a) authorizes appeals to the intermediate court of 
appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under 
HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the 
rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). The supreme court has 
promulgated Rule 58 of the Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP), which specifically requires that "[e]very judgment shall 
be set forth on a separate document." Based on this requirement, 
the supreme court has held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . 
only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the 
judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate 
parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte 
Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai 'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 
(1994). The separate judgment must "either resolve all claims 
against all parties or contain the finding necessary for 
3   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. The September 30,
 
2004 Judgment does neither. 
The August 14, 2007 Amended Judgment, while expressly
 
certifying as final the Circuit Court's disposition of Counts I­
VI of the State's Amended Counterclaim, does not purport to
 
certify the finality of the court's action on the Plaintiffs'
 
Complaint. Instead, the Amended Judgment states the following:
 
Plaintiffs' Complaint was previously dismissed by order
filed on September 22, 2004, and a separate judgment was
entered in favor of Defendant/Counterclaimant State of
Hawaii and against Plaintiffs on the entire Complaint on
September 30, 2004.
3
 
The September 22, 2004 order dismissing Plaintiffs' 
claims was not reduced to a judgment by either the September 30, 
2004 Judgment or the August 14, 2007 Amended Judgment. "An 
appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor 
of or against the party by the time the record is filed in the 
supreme court will be dismissed." Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 120, 
869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted). Accordingly, the appeal on the Plaintiffs' claim against the State is dismissed. 
(2) Appellants fail to provide discernible arguments 
with respect to the points of error challenging FOF 29, COLs 5, 
7, and 8. "An appellate court need not address matters as to 
which the appellant has failed to present a discernible 
argument." Int'l Sav. & Loan Ass'n, Ltd. v. Carbonel, 93 Hawai
'i 
464, 473, 5 P.3d 454, 463 (App. 2000); Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(7) (stating that the argument in the 
opening brief must contain "citations to the authorities, 
statutes and parts of the record relied on" and "[p]oints not 
argued may be deemed waived"); see also, e.g., Ala Moana Boat 
Owners' Ass'n v. State, 50 Haw. 156, 158, 434 P.2d 516 (1967) 
3
 We note that, if the September 30, 2004 Judgment had effectively
constituted a final judgment on the Plaintiffs' affirmative claims against the
State, then the Plaintiffs' attempts to now appeal from that judgment would
have been untimely.

(citations omitted); Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai 'i 225, 
230, 909 P.2d 553, 558 (1995); Citicorp Mortgage, Inc. v. 
Bartolome, 94 Hawai 'i 422, 433, 16 P.3d 827, 838 (App. 2000). 
With respect to FOF 29, Appellants allege that the
 
Circuit Court erred in finding "that sums are owed by Plaintiffs
 
to Defendant," but present no discernible argument in support of
 
that contention. It is not materially disputed that Appellants
 
borrowed $726,000 from the State and promised to repay the money
 
to the State. They have, inter alia, failed to repay any part of
 
the principal, and any interest since 1989. FOF 29 is supported
 
by credible evidence in the record on appeal. 
Appellants argue that the Circuit Court erred in
 
entering COL 5 concluding that a term to which "all parties
 
objectively intended to agree as to both loans was that [Oceanic
 
Kaimamala] and/or the Ohais would make periodic interest-only
 
payments upon disbursed principal." Appellants, however, make no
 
discernible argument and cite no authority or factual findings to
 
explain why COL 5 is wrong. Appellants do not challenge factual
 
findings that support this conclusion, including but not limited
 
to FOFs 15, 20, 21, and 23.
 
Similarly, Appellants challenge COL 7 concluding that
 
"the parties objectively agreed to extend the original loans." 
Again, Appellants fail to present a discernible argument. 
Appellants do not argue or cite any authority or factual findings
 
to explain how or why COL 7 is wrong or argue that the parties
 
did not objectively agree to extend the loans. COL 7 is
 
supported by the Circuit Court's FOFs and the record on appeal.
 
With respect to COL 8, Appellants argue that the
 
Circuit Court erred in concluding that "the [Appellants] breached
 
the contracts and guarantees by not paying sums when due and
 
owing," but present no argument that the conclusion is wrong or
 
that they did not breach the contracts. Appellants borrowed
 
$726,000 from the State and promised to repay the money to the
 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
State. They have, inter alia, failed to repay any part of the
 
principal, and any interest since 1989. COL 8 is supported by
 
the Circuit Court's FOFs and the record on appeal. 
Appellants argue generally that the Circuit Court erred
 
in entering judgment in favor of the State on the counterclaims
 
based on two assertions: (1) that the State breached its duty of
 
good faith and fair dealing, apparently challenging COL 11; and
 
(2) that parol evidence was improperly introduced. 
Appellants argue that the portion of COL 11 providing 
that "there is no credible evidence that the State wrongfully, 
deliberately, or substantially acted to hinder the Ohai's [sic] 
contractual performance" is "simply wrong." However, COL 11 is 
not designated as a point of error, and the Appellants do not 
state where in the record the alleged error occurred or where in 
the record the alleged error was objected to or the manner in 
which the alleged error was brought to the attention of the 
Circuit Court, as is required under HRAP Rule 28(b)(4). Also 
inconsistent with HRAP Rule 28(b)(4), Appellants did not argue in 
the trial court below that the State breached its duty of good 
faith and fair dealing. In its closing argument at trial, 
Appellants argued that the "doctrine of prevention" applies in 
this case – i.e., that State prevented their performance on the 
loan contracts through a willful act or omission. On appeal, 
Appellants appear to replace that theory with the argument that 
the State breached a duty of good faith and fair dealing. This 
court need not consider a point that was not appropriately 
presented in the trial court. See HRS § 641-2 (2004); see also 
Okuhara v. Broida, 51 Haw. 253, 255, 456 P.2d 228, 230 (1969); Craft v. Peebles, 78 Hawai
'i 287, 294, 893 P.2d 138, 145 (1995); 
Price v. AIG Hawai 'i Ins. Co., Inc., 107 Hawai 'i 106, 111, 111 
P.3d 1, 6 (2005); HRAP Rule 28(b)(4)(iii). 
In addition, the record supports the Circuit Court's
 
conclusion. The assertion that the State, as lender, breached a
 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
duty of good faith against the Appellants, as borrowers, is an 
affirmative defense. See Stanford Carr Dev. Corp. v. Unity 
House, Inc., 111 Hawai 'i 286, 304, 141 P.3d 459, 477 (2006). 
Accordingly, Appellants have the burden of proving that the State 
breached that duty. Id. We conclude that Appellants have not 
satisfied that burden. The evidence does not support a conclusion that the State acted in bad faith. It appears that 
the State's delayed disbursement of the loan proceeds was 
consistent with Appellants' justified expectations because, inter 
alia, Appellants themselves sought to delay disbursements due to 
conflicts with their vessel builder and the loan documents 
included various pre-conditions to disbursement. Furthermore, 
there is substantial evidence in the record to refute an argument 
that any alleged breach of good faith "was the sole cause of 
[Appellants'] failure to repay the loan." See Stanford Carr, 111 
Hawai
'i at 304, 141 P.3d at 477 (emphasis added). The 
construction dispute between Appellants and their builder 
indisputably delayed the completion of the vessel for several 
years and prevented the use of the vessel to generate income to 
repay the debt. 
Appellants' argument that parol evidence was improperly
 
introduced appears to be directed at its challenge to COL 6. 
However, in the proceedings below, Appellants neither argued that
 
the Loan 28 documents were completely integrated nor objected to
 
any extrinsic evidence introduced by the State on the basis that
 
it was barred by the parol evidence rule. "The proposition that
 
the protection of the parol evidence rule, like our
 
constitutional protections, can be waived, is a reasonable
 
one . . . . [O]nce admitted without objection, extrinsic
 
evidence is entitled to full consideration in determining the
 
true intent of the parties." Okuhara v. Broida, 51 Haw. 253,
 
257, 456 P.2d 228, 231 (1969). Because the Appellants are
 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
clearly invoking the parol evidence rule for the first time on
 
appeal, this argument is waived.
 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's August 14, 2007
 
Amended Judgment is affirmed. To the extent that Appellants seek
 
to appeal Plaintiffs' affirmative claim against the State, the
 
appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
