APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-DIVORCE NO. 05-1-1999)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Alan H.J. Yuen (Alan) appeals from

 
the Decree Granting Absolute Divorce and Awarding Child Custody
 
(Decree) filed on August 23, 2007 in the Family Court of the
 First Circuit (family court).
1 In the Decree, the family court
 
granted Alan's request for a divorce from Defendant-Appellee
 Susan T.A. Yuen (Susan), ordered Alan to pay child support to
 Susan on behalf of the parties' three children, divided the
 couple's assets and debts, ordered an equalization payment to
 Alan be sequestered for the benefit of the parties' children, and
 awarded Susan attorney's fees and costs. On November 14, 2007,
 the family court issued written Findings of Fact and Conclusions
 of Law.

On appeal, Alan argues that the family court erred
 
(1) in denying his request for assistance from his
 
girlfriend, Eva Kim (Kim), at trial, in violation of Title II of
 the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12131­12165;
 
(2) in awarding Alan his retirement benefits without
 
adjusting for the fact that the benefits constitute a pretax
 asset and in valuing the benefits at $84,411;
 
(3) by including as a marital asset and awarding to
 
Alan Li'l Audrey, which boat Alan had owned prior to the divorce
 action, and issuing clearly erroneous Findings of Fact (FOFs) 47,
 50, 52, 53, 55, 56, 99, and 100 and wrong Conclusions of Law
 (COLs) 20 and 34;
 
(4) by including as a marital asset and awarding to
 
Alan $50,000 he allegedly withdrew from his Independent
 Retirement Account and issuing clearly erroneous FOFs 63 and 101
 and wrong COL 35;
 
(5) by including as a marital asset and awarding to
 
Alan his lump sum Social Security Disability Insurance payment of
 $23,952 and issuing clearly erroneous FOFs 67 and 102;
 
(6) in calculating Alan's income for child support
 
purposes and issuing clearly erroneous FOFs 24-30, 35, 38, and 78
 and wrong COL 7;
 
(7) in requiring Alan's award of assets from the
 
marital estate to be sequestered and issuing clearly erroneous
 FOFs 37, 40, 43, 74, 75, 77, and 87 and wrong COLS 29-32, and 36­40;
 
(8) in memorializing the FOFs and COLs mentioned in
 
points of error 2-5 and 7 in the Sequestration of Equalization
 Payment section of the Decree; and
 
(9) finding in its "Order Granting [Susan's] Motion for
 
an Award of Attorney's Fees & Costs Pursuant to Hawaii Family
 Court Rule 68" (Attorney's Fees Award) that Susan was entitled to
 an award of attorney's fees and costs.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Alan's
 
points of error as follows:
 
(1) The family court did not err in denying Alan's
 
request for assistance from Kim at trial. Alan failed to show he
 was a "qualified individual with a disability" entitled to
 accommodations under the ADA because the evidence shows Alan was
 competent to understand the nature of the divorce proceedings and
 was competent to present his case and conduct a defense. 42
 U.S.C.A. § 12131.
 
(2) With regard to Alan's remaining arguments on 
appeal, he cites to no authority in support of his contentions, and we deem them waived. Hawaii Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(7); see Ala Moana Boat Owners' Ass'n v. State, 50 Haw. 156, 158, 434 P.2d 516, 518 (1967); Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai
'i 225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 558 (1995); see also Int'l 
Sav. & Loan Ass'n, Ltd. v. Carbonel, 93 Hawai 'i 464, 473, 5 P.3d 
454, 463 (App. 2000); Citicorp Mortgage, Inc. v. Bartolome, 94 Hawai
'i 422, 433, 16 P.3d 827, 838 (App. 2000). 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Decree Granting Absolute
 
Divorce and Awarding Child Custody filed on August 23, 2007 in
 the Family Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
