Appellant Lopresto raises the following four points of
 
error on appeal:
 
1.	 The Family Court committed reversible error in
concluding that Lopresto committed fraud as of 2001,and in granting relief based on Rules 60(b)(6) and60(b)(3) of the Hawai
'i Family Court Rules (HFCR). 
2.	 The Family Court erred in finding and concluding that
Nakamura's failure to make reasonable efforts to
 discover the fraud nevertheless entitles him to relief.
 
3.	 The Family Court erred in finding that Lopresto
committed fraud and failed to adopt appropriate
findings and conclusions to support a finding of fraud.
 
4.	 The Family Court failed to charge interest for
delinquent alimony payments.
 
Cross-Appellant Nakamura raises the following seven
 
points of error on appeal:
 
1.	 The Family Court erred in finding that Nakamura's
failure to discover Lopresto's fraud before late
2000/early 2001 barred Nakamura from relief prior to
December 31, 2001.
 
2.	 The Family Court erred in awarding Lopresto $37,000 in
outstanding base support.
 
3.	 The Family Court erred in failing to award Nakamura
$90,000 for alimony paid to Lopresto from September
1997 to February 2005.
 
4.	 The Family Court erred in failing to award Nakamura the
$5,000 he paid to Lopresto in December 2005 pursuant to
an order granting a motion for continuance.
 
5.	 The Family Court erred in failing to find that Lopresto
altered the Divorce Decree after Nakamura signed it.
 
6.	 The Family Court erred in failing to modify the
definition of "income" in the Divorce Decree from
 "adjust[ed] gross" income to "taxable income," and
erred in its finding of Nakamura's adjusted gross
income.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
7.	 The Family Court erred in denying Nakamura's Motion for
Reconsideration or to Alter/Amend Order Filed on
July 30, 2007.
 
Based upon a careful review of the record and the
 
briefs submitted by the parties, and having given due
 
consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by
 
the parties, we vacate the Family Court's July 30, 2007 order and
 
the December 21, 2007 findings and conclusions. We remand to the
 
Family Court for further proceedings consistent with this
 
opinion.
 
I.	 Factual Background and Proceedings Below
 
Nakamura and Lopresto were granted a divorce by way of
 
a Divorce Decree filed on August 20, 1997. The Divorce Decree,
 
signed by both parties, required Nakamura to pay Lopresto alimony
 
for fifteen years "regardless of Plaintiff's remarriage." The
 
amount of the alimony payments under the Divorce Decree started
 
at a base of $1,000 per month, with provisions for certain annual
 
percentage increases. There were also conditional increases to
 
the base amount, dependent on whether Nakamura's annual income
 
exceeded certain specified levels.
2 Following entry of the
 
2 The Divorce Decree states, in relevant part:
 
(1) Defendant shall pay as and for support and
maintenance to Plaintiff, a monthly sum of one thousand U.S.
dollars (U.S. $1,000.00), taxable under the U.S. tax law to
Plaintiff, as support and maintenance, to be paid to her on
the first day of each month commencing on the first day of
August, 1997.
(2) The above-mentioned alimony payments to be made
by Defendant as set forth in this agreement shall be for
fifteen (15) years regardless of Plaintiff's remarriage. 
The above-mentioned alimony payments shall be increased by
the lesser of (1) of [sic] percentage of Defendant's income
increase or (2) five percent (5%) per annum. If Defendant's
 annual income should exceed one hundred thousand U.S.
 dollars ($100,000.00), the alimony payment will be increased
to two thousand U.S. dollars ($2,000.00) per month beginning
on the first day of the following year with an increase by
the lesser of (1) a percentage of Defendant's income
increase or (2) 5% per annum; if Defendant's annual income
should exceed two hundred thousand U.S. dollars ($200,000)
(continued...)

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Divorce Decree, Nakamura paid alimony to Lopresto from September
 
1997 through February 2005 in the amount of $1,000 per month,
 
with no increases. He stopped making alimony payments
 
thereafter. 
On September 28, 2005, Lopresto filed her Motion for
 
Enforcement Relief seeking payment of alimony from Nakamura
 
pursuant to the Divorce Decree provisions, as well as interest,
 
attorneys' fees, and sanctions. In her supporting affidavits,
 
Lopresto alleged that despite her numerous requests to Nakamura
 
for the "cost of living" increases due under the Divorce Decree
 
and for his tax returns to determine if she was entitled to an
 
increase in base alimony, Nakamura did not provide the increased
 
payments or his tax returns.
 
On October 25, 2005, Nakamura filed a Motion for Relief
 
from Decree or in the Alternative for Termination of Spousal
 
Support, citing to HFCR Rules 54.1 and 60(b)(6). In his
 
supporting affidavit, Nakamura alleged that he had agreed to pay
 
$1,000 per month for fifteen years, but that alimony was to
 
terminate upon Lopresto's remarriage; and that he had agreed to
 
increases and decreases to the alimony amount that were different
 
than what was reflected in the Divorce Decree. Nakamura alleged
 
that he stopped paying alimony after learning in 2000 or 2001
 
that Lopresto had remarried, at which point she told him the
 
2 (...continued)
per annum, the alimony payment will be increased to three
thousand U.S. dollars ($3,000.00) per month beginning on the
first day of the following year with an increase by the
lesser of (1) a percentage of Defendant's income increase or
(2) 5% per annum; if Defendant's annual income should exceed
three hundred thousand U.S. dollars ($300,000.00) per annum,
the alimony payment will be increased to $4,000.00 per month
beginning on the first day of the following year with an
increase by the lesser of (1) a percentage of Defendant's
income increase o[r] (2) 5% per annum.
This agreement shall terminate only upon Plaintiff's
death. . . . 
(Emphasis added).

Divorce Decree required payment even after her remarriage. He
 
states he then reviewed a filed copy of the Divorce Decree and
 
alleges to have learned that Lopresto had made changes to the
 
Divorce Decree after he signed it. According to Nakamura, he did
 
not take action at that time because Lopresto acknowledged the
 
"true" agreement, that alimony payments terminated upon her
 
remarriage. However, Nakamura further asserts that he thereafter
 
continued to pay $1,000 a month even though he believed he was
 
not obligated to make payments, because Lopresto asked him to
 
help her a little while longer and he sympathized with her
 
financial situation.
 
As an alternative basis for his motion before the
 
Family Court, Nakamura asserted that "[i]n the event this Court
 
denies Defendant relief under Rule 60(b)(6) of the Family Court
 
Rules, this Court should terminate future spousal support on the
 
basis that there has been [a] material change in circumstances,
 
and Plaintiff no longer requires support." Given its ruling
 
based on HFCR Rule 60(b), the Family Court did not reach this
 
issue.3
 
The Family Court held a consolidated trial on the
 
parties' motions on October 26, 2005, April 7, 2006, and June 22,
 
2007. At trial, the parties disputed numerous factual points,
 
including: whether Nakamura had agreed to the terms in the
 
Divorce Decree which tracked the terms in a Divorce Agreement
 
4
also signed by Nakamura;  whether Lopresto had fraudulently
altered the Divorce Decree; whether, prior to his signing the
 
Divorce Decree, Lopresto made false representations to Nakamura
 
that changes he had requested were made; whether Lopresto

 Because the Family Court did not reach this issue, we express no
opinion on Nakamura's alternative ground for relief.

 Nakamura claims to have made handwritten changes to the Divorce
Agreement which were to have been incorporated into the Divorce Decree.
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
concealed from Nakamura the fact that she had remarried in 1998;5
 
and the circumstances that led to Nakamura continuing to pay
 
alimony up to February 2005.
 
Nakamura asserted at trial that he did not review the
 
Divorce Decree before signing it because Lopresto assured him
 
that changes he had allegedly requested had been made, including
 
that alimony would terminate upon Lopresto's remarriage. He
 
6
stated he did not have a copy of the filed Divorce Decree  and
contends that it was not until late 2000 or early 2001, over
 
three years after the Divorce Decree was filed, that he reviewed
 
a filed copy of the Divorce Decree. Nakamura asserted at trial
 
that he continued to make alimony payments after learning about
 
Lopresto's remarriage because he contended Lopresto acknowledged
 
that their agreement had been to terminate payments upon her
 
remarriage, Lopresto needed financial assistance at the time,
 
Lopresto agreed not to seek an increase in the payment amount,
 
and Nakamura believed it would be too costly to litigate. He
 
testified that he terminated monthly alimony payments to Lopresto
 
in March 2005 because he believed that she no longer needed his
 
financial assistance.
 
On July 30, 2007, the Family Court entered its order

 
resolving the parties' motions and on December 21, 2007 entered
 
its Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law. The Family Court
 
ruled that Lopresto had committed fraud, but that Nakamura owed
 
some outstanding alimony to Lopresto in the amount of $37,000. 
Specifically, the Family Court concluded that "[Lopresto]
 
committed fraud by telling [Nakamura] that the Divorce Decree
 
contained the terms of their oral agreement, including the term

 Lopresto claims that she told Nakamura she had remarried and that
Nakamura met her new husband in Hawaii in May 2000.

 Lopresto's attorney filed a Certificate of Service on September 11,
1997 stating that the Divorce Decree was mailed to Nakamura.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
that alimony terminated upon her remarriage" and that "[Nakamura]
 
relied on [Lopresto's] representation to his detriment." 
However, the Family Court also concluded that Nakamura did not
 
discover the fraud until "he finally obtained a copy of the
 
Divorce Decree in late 2000/early 2001," and because he "failed
 
to take reasonable efforts to discover the fraud before late
 
2000/early 2001, he is not entitled to relief until December 31,
 
2001." The court found that as of December 31, 2001, Nakamura
 
7
owed Lopresto outstanding base support of $37,000,  but did not
award attorneys' fees or interest on the award.
 
Nakamura filed a Motion for Reconsideration on

 
August 9, 2007, which the court denied by order filed
 
September 25, 2007. Both parties filed timely notices of appeal.
 
II. Discussion
 
A. HFCR Rule 60(b)
 
The Family Court's grant or denial of a motion under 
HFCR Rule 60(b) is reviewed for abuse of discretion. De Mello v. 
De Mello, 3 Haw. App. 165, 169, 646 P.2d 409, 412 (1982); see 
also In re RGB, 123 Hawai 'i 1, 16, 229 P.3d 1066, 1081 (2010); 
Hayashi v. Hayashi, 4 Haw. App. 286, 291, 666 P.2d 171, 175 (1983). 
An abuse of discretion occurs where the trial court has
 
clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules
or principles of law or practice to the substantial
detriment of a party litigant. In addition, the burden of
establishing abuse of discretion is on appellant, and a
strong showing is required to establish it.
 
In re RGB, 123 Hawai 'i at 16-17, 229 P.3d at 1081-82 (internal 
citations, brackets, and quotation marks omitted). 
7
 The court calculated the $37,000 due as follows: $1,000 for the month
of August 1997 and $1,000 per month (in addition to the $1,000 per month
Nakamura already paid) from January 1999 through and including December 2001.
The amounts owing from January 1999 to December 2001 appear to be based on the
Family Court's finding that Nakamura's annual income began to exceed $100,000
in 1998. Under the Divorce Decree, if Nakamura's annual income exceeded
$100,000, Lopresto was entitled to an increase in the base alimony from $1,000
to $2,000 starting on the first day of the following year.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Moreover and importantly, "[t]he timeliness of a motion 
brought pursuant to HFCR Rule 60(b) implicates the jurisdiction 
of the family court." Child Support Enforcement Agency v. Doe, 
98 Hawai 'i 499, 503, 51 P.3d 366, 370 (2002). 
HFCR Rule 60(b) reads, in its entirety, as follows: 
Rule 60. RELIEF FROM JUDGMENT OR ORDER.
 
(b) Mistakes; inadvertence; excusable neglect; newly
discovered evidence; fraud. On motion and upon such terms as
are just, the court may relieve a party or a party's legal
representative from any or all of the provisions of a final
judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons:
(1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect;
(2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could
not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial
 under Rule 59(b); (3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated
intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other
misconduct of an adverse party; (4) the judgment is void;
(5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or
discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has
been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer
equitable that the judgment should have prospective
application; or (6) any other reason justifying relief from
the operation of the judgment. The motion shall be made
 
within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2), and (3)
not more than one year after the judgment, order, or
proceedings was entered or taken. For reasons (1) and (3)
the averments in the motion shall be made in compliance with
Rule 9(b) of these rules. A motion under this subdivision
(b) does not affect the finality of a judgment or suspend
its operation. This rule does not limit the power of a court
to entertain an independent action to relieve a party from a
judgment, order, or proceeding, or to set aside a judgment
for fraud upon the court.
 
HFCR Rule 60(b) (2006) (emphasis added).8
 
In its December 21, 2007 findings and conclusions, the
 
Family Court appears to have merged and relied upon both HFCR
 
Rules 60(b)(6) and 60(b)(3), although the basis for its ruling is
 
clearly its finding that Lopresto had committed fraud. The
 
Family Court referenced both HFCR Rules 60(b)(6) and 60(b)(3),
 
8
 HFCR Rule 60(b) is substantially similar to Hawai' i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) Rule 60(b) and Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) Rule
60(b); therefore, "the treatises and cases interpreting HRCP, Rule 60(b) andFRCP, Rule 60(b) provide persuasive reasoning for the interpretation of HFCR60(b)." Hayashi, 4 Haw. App. at 290 n.6, 666 P.2d at 174 n.6; see also, ChildSupport Enforcement Agency, 98 Hawai' i at 503 n.7, 51 P.3d at 370 n.7. 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
recited requirements for proving fraud, and then concluded that
 
Lopresto "committed fraud" by misrepresenting the terms contained
 
in the Divorce Decree. By conflating clauses (6) and (3) of HFCR
 
Rule 60(b), the Family Court did not properly apply the
 
requirements for either provision. Further, although the Family
 
Court specifically noted that a motion under HFCR Rule 60(b) must
 
be made "within a reasonable time" and, for fraud, "not more than
 
one year after the judgment, order, or proceedings was entered or
 
taken," the Family Court's ruling did not address the timeliness
 
of Nakamura's motion seeking relief from the Divorce Decree.
 
(1) Rule 60(b)(6)
 
Nakamura's motion sought relief pursuant to HFCR Rule 
60(b)(6), but such relief was precluded given the circumstances 
of this case and Nakamura's basis for seeking relief. The 
Hawai'i Supreme Court has held that where the asserted grounds 
for relief are based on "circumstances specified in one or more of clauses (1) through (5) of HFCR Rule 60(b), [the] motion 
cannot, as a matter of law, be construed as a HFCR Rule 60(b)(6) 
motion." Child Support Enforcement Agency, 98 Hawai
'i at 504, 51 
P.3d at 371; see also Hayashi, 4 Haw. App. at 290, 666 P.2d at 174 (HFCR Rule 60(b)(6) "is a residual clause" designed to 
"provide relief for considerations not covered by the preceding 
five clauses.") (emphasis added); Citicorp Mortg. Inc. v. 
Bartolome, 94 Hawai
'i 422, 437-38, 16 P.3d 827, 842-43 (App. 
2000) (noting that first five clauses of HFCR 60(b) are mutually 
exclusive of the sixth clause); 12 Moore's Federal Practice Â¶ 
60.48[2] (3d ed. 2010). 
Here, Nakamura claimed he was entitled to relief from
 
the Divorce Decree because of Lopresto's alleged fraudulent
 
actions and the Family Court based its granting of relief on a
 
finding that Lopresto had committed fraud. "Fraud" is one of the
 
grounds for relief specifically stated in the first five clauses
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
of HFCR Rule 60(b), being set forth in Rule 60(b)(3). Therefore,
 
because fraud is a basis for relief under HFCR Rule 60(b)(3), the
 
Family Court abused its discretion in relying on Rule 60(b)(6) to
 
grant relief to Nakamura.
 
(2) Rule 60(b)(3)
 
The Family Court also erred in relying on HFCR Rule
 
60(b)(3) as a basis for its ruling. As the Family Court noted
 
and as expressly stated in the rule, a motion pursuant to Rule
 
60(b) "shall be made within a reasonable time, and for reasons
 
(1), (2), and (3) not more than one year after the judgment,
 
order, or proceedings was entered or taken." (Emphasis added). 
In this case, the Divorce Decree was entered on August 20, 1997
 
and Nakamura filed his motion seeking relief from the Divorce
 
Decree on October 25, 2005, over eight years later. The rule
 
explicitly provides that commencement of the one-year period is
 
triggered by entry of the judgment or order, and there is no
 
extension of time for filing a motion under HFCR Rule 60(b)(3)
 
based on when the alleged fraud is discovered.9
 
In Child Support Enforcement Agency, the Hawai 'i 
Supreme Court determined that the movant's motion for relief from 
judgment was barred even though she alleged to have first 
discovered potential new evidence and/or fraud almost two years 
after the judgment was entered. 98 Hawai 'i at 501, 504, 51 P.3d 
at 368, 371. Given the one-year limit applicable to HFCR Rules 60(b)(1) and 60(b)(3), the Hawai
'i Supreme Court held that the 
family court did not have jurisdiction to consider the motion. 
Id. at 505, 51 P.3d at 372. Likewise, under the substantially 
similar Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 
(FRCP), the one-year period applicable to clauses (1), (2) and 
9
 In this case, even such an extension would be of no avail to Nakamura
because he claims to have discovered the alleged fraud in late 2000 or early
2001, and still did not seek relief from the Divorce Decree until October
2005.
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(3) is deemed an absolute limit. "The concept of reasonable time
 
cannot be used to extend the one-year limit. A motion under
 
clauses (1), (2), or (3) must be denied as untimely if made more
 
than one year after judgment regardless of whether the delay was
 
reasonable." 11 Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal Practice and
 
Procedure: Civil 2d Â§ 2866 at 391 (2nd ed. 1995); see also 12
 
Moore's Federal Practice Â¶ 60.65[2][a] (3d ed. 2010); U.S. v.
 
Marin, 720 F.2d 229, 231 (1st Cir. 1983) (ruling that one-year
 
limit under FRCP Rule 60(b)(1), (2) and (3) was "absolute bar" to
 
debtor's motion for relief from judgment on basis that adverse
 
party concealed relevant information); Serzysko v. Chase
 
Manhattan Bank, 461 F.2d 699 (2nd Cir. 1972) (holding that
 
plaintiff's motion to set aside prior judgment on grounds of
 
newly discovered witnesses that would establish adverse party's
 
witnesses committed perjury at trial was time barred under FRCP
 
Rules 60(b)(2) and (3)).
 
Thus, the Family Court erred in granting relief from 
the Divorce Decree based on HFCR Rule 60(b)(3) because this basis 
was time barred and the Family Court lacked jurisdiction to act 
pursuant to this rule. Child Support Enforcement Agency, 98 
Hawai'i at 505, 51 P.3d at 372. 
(3) Family Court Orders Vacated
 
Given that the Family Court did not have authority to
 
act under HFCR Rule 60(b)(6) or Rule 60(b)(3), we vacate the
 July 30, 2007 order and the December 21, 2007 findings and
 
conclusions. Our ruling in this regard disposes of Lopresto's
 
first three points of error on appeal, as well as Nakamura's
 
points of error 1-3, and 5. It also disposes of: that part of
 
Nakamura's sixth issue on appeal that contends the Family Court
 
erred in not modifying the definition of income in the Divorce
 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Decree;10 and that part of Nakamura's seventh point of error
 
asserting the Family Court should have amended its July 30, 2007
 
order by terminating alimony on the date of Lopresto's
 
remarriage.11
 
B. Interest Owed on Outstanding Alimony Award
 
In her motion to enforce the Divorce Decree, Lopresto 
requested that the Family Court award ten percent interest per 
annum on alimony payments owing to her. In her fourth point of 
error on appeal, she asserts that the Family Court erred in 
failing to award her post-judgment interest pursuant to HRS Â§ 
478-3 (2008). Nakamura does not address the issue of interest in 
his briefs on appeal. We review a ruling as to interest claimed 
under HRS Â§ 478-3 for abuse of discretion. Metcalf v. Voluntary 
Emps.' Benefits Ass'n, 99 Hawai 'i 53, 57, 52 P.3d 823, 827 (2002) 
(citation omitted). 
"In the absence of express statutory authority 
governing the payment of interest in a specific type of claim, 
HRS Â§ 478-3, governing the payment of interest in civil judgments 
generally, applies." Metcalf, 99 Hawai 'i at 60, 52 P.3d at 830 
(citation omitted). HRS Â§ 478-3 mandates that: "[i]nterest at the rate of ten per cent a year, and no more, shall be allowed on 
any judgment recovered before any court in the State, in any 
civil suit." (Emphasis added). On remand, the Family Court 
should therefore address and consider the post-judgment interest 
on the amount of alimony that the Family Court ultimately 
10 This argument was based on Nakamura's assertion that, like the
remarriage provision, the definition of income in the decree was supposed to
have been amended before it was finalized for Nakamura's signature.
11 Nakamura's seventh point of error contends the Family Court erred in
denying his motion for reconsideration of the July 30, 2007 order, which
sought to have the Family Court amend its July 30, 2007 order by: (1)
terminating alimony on the date of Lopresto's remarriage, rather than 2001;
and (2) crediting Nakamura the amount of $44,000 he alleges to have paid
Lopresto after December 31, 2001.
 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
determines Nakamura owes under the Divorce Decree. See Doe v. 
Doe, 97 Hawai 'i 160, 163, 34 P.3d 1059, 1062 (App. 2001). 
C. Nakamura's Claims Regarding Credit For Amounts Paid
 
In his fourth point of error on appeal, Nakamura
 
contends the Family Court erroneously failed to award him $5,000
 
that he paid in December 2005 pursuant to a court order
 
continuing trial. As part of his seventh point of error,
 
Nakamura argues that the Family Court erred in not amending its
 
July 30, 2007 order to credit him for $44,000 he alleges to have
 
paid Lopresto after December 31, 2001. On remand, the Family
 
Court will address the amount of alimony due to Lopresto and
 
therefore may consider the off-sets, if any, because of the
 
amounts already paid by Nakamura.
 
D. Finding As To Nakamura's Income
 
Nakamura contends, as part of his sixth point of error
 
on appeal, that the Family Court erred in finding his adjusted
 
yearly income exceeded $100,000 for the years 1998-2003 and
 
exceeded $200,000 for the years 2004 and 2006.
 
Findings of fact are reviewed for clear error. Child 
Support Enforcement Agency v. Roe, 96 Hawai 'i 1, 11, 25 P.3d 60, 
70 (2001). A factual finding "is clearly erroneous when (1) the record lacks substantial evidence to support the finding or 
determination, or (2) despite substantial evidence to support the 
finding or determination, the appellate court is left with the 
definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made." Id. 
(citations omitted). 
Based on the record, we conclude the challenged
 
findings by the Family Court are not clearly erroneous. To the
