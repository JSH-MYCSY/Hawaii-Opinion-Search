 HRS § 580-56 provides, in relevant part:
 
Property rights following dissolution of marriage.
(a) Every decree of divorce which does not specifically

otherwise provided by law, until such time as a decree or
order finally dividing the property owned by the parties or
either of them as of the effective date of the entry of the
decree of divorce dissolving his or her prior marriage shall
be entered. Upon the entry of a decree or order finally
dividing the property of the parties to a matrimonial action
in which a decree of divorce has been entered, the spouse of
a party to such action who has remarried shall have all of
the rights of a spouse as provided by chapter 533 and
chapter 560, or as otherwise provided by law, in and to the

Hoeflinger appeals from the June 18, 2007 Decision
 
("Decision"), the October 2, 2007 Judgment ("Judgment"), and
 
various other pre-judgment orders issued by the Family Court.3
 
Chen filed a cross-appeal, which we deem to have been abandoned.4
 
Hoeflinger argues that this court lacks appellate
 
jurisdiction because (1) there is no final appealable order
 because the Family Court did not divide all of the parties'
 property and debts, and (2) the Judgment is void because it was
 issued after the Family Court's jurisdiction over the parties'
 property had expired.
 
In the alternative, Hoeflinger challenges several
 
findings of fact and conclusions of law in the Decision and
 Judgment. He asserts that the Family Court erred by (3) holding
 that the June 6, 2001 post-nuptial agreement between Chen and
 Hoeflinger ("Post-Nuptial Agreement") was void ab initio, (4)
 finding that he wasted marital assets and deducting the value of
 the waste from his post-marital share, and (5) finding that the
 parties formed a premarital economic partnership.
 
Hoeflinger also claims that the Family Court erred by
 
(6) denying his motion to disqualify Judge Yoshioka and by
 allowing other Family Court judges to preside in the case after
 Judge Yoshioka recused himself and all other Family Court judges,
 and (7) denying his ex parte motion to expedite the hearing on
 his motion for reconsideration while granting two continuances,

entitled to dower or curtesy in the former spouse's real
estate, or any part thereof, nor to any share of the former
spouse's personal estate.
 
HAW. REV. STAT. § 580-56 (2006).
 
3 The Honorable Terrence T. Yoshioka presided over all matters
except the July 11, 2007 motion to disqualify Judge Yoshioka, over which the
Honorable Ben H. Gaddis presided.

 On October 31, 2007, Chen cross-appealed from the Decision and the
Judgment, and then filed an amended notice of cross-appeal on November 1,
2007. Chen's counsel withdrew in January 2008. Chen did not file an
 answering brief or an opening brief, but on March 31, 2008 filed "Hui Z. Chen
Response To The Appeal Motion Filed By Thomas J. Hoeflinger And His Attorney
Paul K. Hamano on October 2, 2007" ("Response"), which identified no points of
error, urged affirmation of the Decision and Judgment, and took issue
generally with Hoeflinger's notice of appeal. As a result, we treat the
Response as an answering brief and deem Chen's cross-appeal to have been
abandoned.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
despite the limited time available to complete the case. 
We vacate findings of the Family Court related to the
 
waste of marital assets, the enforceability of the parties' Post-
Nuptial Agreement, one related adjustment, and one related
 distribution. We remand for further findings on the issue of the
 unconscionability of the Post-Nuptial Agreement and for
 recalculation and redistribution of the assets. We affirm in all
 other respects.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
A. Chronology of the case
 Chen and Hoeflinger married in the People's Republic of 
China ("PRC") on March 1, 1995. The couple moved to Hawai' i in 
2000. Chen filed a complaint for divorce in the Family Court on November 4, 2005, and the Decree was issued on July 17, 2006. The Decree explicitly reserved jurisdiction in the Family Court over "all issues pertaining to spousal support and alimony, property division and allocation of debts . . . ." 
At trial on the post-Decree issues, Chen testified that
 
she moved in with Hoeflinger in July 1992 and lived with him
 until he left China for the United States in November 1995. 
According to Chen, prior to their marriage but while living
 together, she and Hoeflinger were sexually intimate and she
 helped pay for the couple's everyday expenses. Evidence was
 presented that in September 1995, Hoeflinger gave as gifts
 $29,000.00 to his children and $65,000.00 to three business
 acquaintances who assisted with business transactions in China. 
Hoeflinger introduced the notarized Post-Nuptial Agreement, which
 provided, in relevant part, that Chen would transfer her one-half
 undivided interest in the marital residence ("Marital Residence")
 to Hoeflinger in the event of divorce. 
The trial on the post-Decree issues ended on March 19,
 
2007. On June 18, 2007, the Family Court issued the Decision
 which concluded, in part, that: (1) Chen and Hoeflinger formed a
 pre-marital economic partnership beginning in July 1992; (2)
 Hoeflinger wasted $94,000.00 and that value was deductible from
 Hoeflinger's share of the marital estate ("Finding 12"); (3) 
4
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hoeflinger wasted $94,000.00, which, when offset by his
 
$18,348.79 in Category 1 assets, left Hoeflinger responsible for
 $75,651.21 in wasted assets ("Finding 18"); and (4) the Post-
Nuptial Agreement was unenforceable "due to the absence of
 knowledge as to the scope and value of [Hoeflinger's] assets, and
 because it was unconscionable" ("Findings 34 and 35"). 
The Decision contained an order ("Order") which awarded
 
each party "one-half 1/2 of the remaining assets of the parties
 consisting of $859,791.81 now in [Hoeflinger's] control, and the
 $31,046.60 in Fidelity Investments Accounts disposed off [sic] or
 held by [Chen]," subject to certain adjustments. Among other
 things, the adjustments required Hoeflinger to pay Chen
 $37,825.00, or approximately one-half of the $75,651.21 of
 marital waste ("Adjustment 'A'"). The Family Court also ordered
 Hoeflinger to transfer his title to the Marital Residence to Chen
 and deducted its value, $368,000.00, from Chen's share of
 Category 5 assets ("Distribution 'i'"). The Family Court
 expressly denied "[a]ll other claims, counter-claims, or cross-
claims of the parties not specifically addressed[.]" 
Hoeflinger filed a motion for reconsideration of the
 
Decision on June 28, 2007 ("Motion for Reconsideration"), which
 presented several of the arguments raised now on appeal. On
 July 2, 2007, Hoeflinger filed an ex parte motion to expedite the
 hearing on the Motion for Reconsideration. The Family Court
 denied the ex parte motion on July 16, 2007. On October 2, 2007,
 the Family Court denied the Motion for Reconsideration, stating
 that it had "lost jurisdiction to hear matters affecting property
 division issues" after July 17, 2007, pursuant to HRS § 580-56(d)
 and Boulton v. Boulton, 69 Haw. 1, 730 P.2d 338 (1986). The
 Judgment was filed on the same day. 
B. Motion to disqualify Judge Yoshioka
 On July 11, 2007, Hoeflinger filed a motion to
 
disqualify Judge Yoshioka ("Motion to Disqualify") on the grounds
 that Chen's counsel, Steven J. Kim ("Attorney Kim"), had been
 appointed as a per diem judge of the Family Court on April 13,
 2007. Hoeflinger's counsel had become aware of Attorney Kim's
 
5
   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appointment on May 4, 2007. 
In conjunction with the Motion to Disqualify,
 
Hoeflinger submitted an affidavit stating his belief that Judge
 
Yoshioka was biased against him. This belief was purportedly
 based on "[his] own personal feelings obtained from the case";
 the Decision, in which Judge Yoshioka stated that Hoeflinger's
 testimony was not credible; and the fact that "[Chen's] attorney
 was appointed as a per diem family court judge to serve in the
 same court and courtroom as Judge Yoshioka."
5 In addition to
 
requesting that Judge Yoshioka be disqualified, Hoeflinger
 requested that the Order be nullified and that a new judge hear
 the case de novo. 
Judge Yoshioka held a hearing on the Motion to
 
Disqualify on July 20, 2007. At the hearing, Judge Yoshioka
 explained that he was on a committee that interviewed applicants
 for per diem judgeships and that the committee submitted
 recommendations to the chief justice on or about March 19, 2007. 
Judge Yoshioka said that he was inclined to deny the
 
motion because Hoeflinger's counsel had received notice of
 Attorney Kim's appointment long before the Decision was issued
 and, therefore, waived his right to object. Judge Yoshioka
 believed that the fact that Attorney Kim was an applicant for a
 per diem judgeship during the trial did not preclude Judge
 Yoshioka from hearing the case or rendering a decision. 
After further argument, Judge Yoshioka decided that he
 
would not disqualify himself, but that he would conditionally
 recuse both himself and all third circuit family court judges. 
5 The motion was based on HRS §601-7(b), which states, in part:
 
Whenever a party to any suit, action, or proceeding,
civil or criminal, makes and files an affidavit that the
judge before whom the action or proceeding is to be tried or
heard has a personal bias or prejudice either against the
party or in favor of any opposite party to the suit, the
judge shall be disqualified from proceeding therein. Every
such affidavit shall state the facts and the reasons for the
 belief that bias or prejudice exists and shall be filed
before the trial or hearing of the action or proceeding, or
good cause shall be shown for the failure to file it within
such time.
 
H
AW. REV. STAT. § 601-7(b) (1993).
 
6
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Judge Yoshioka qualified his ruling, stating that the Family
 
Court was recused as long as Attorney Kim represented Chen. 
Attorney Kim filed a Withdrawal and Substitution of
 
Counsel on August 1, 2007. Deputy Chief Circuit Court Judge Greg
 K. Nakamura, who intended to assume responsibility for the case
 upon Judge Yoshioka's conditional recusal of the Family Court,
 determined that there was no longer any basis for the Family
 Court to refer the case to a circuit court judge, and so referred
 the case back to the Family Court for a further hearing on Judge
 Yoshioka's disqualification. 
On August 9, 2007, Judge Ben H. Gaddis presided over a
 
further hearing on the Motion to Disqualify. Judge Gaddis stated
 his understanding that "Judge Yoshioka was uncomfortable deciding
 the motion to disqualify[,]" and that his interpretation of the
 record was that Judge Yoshioka intended that "someone else
 [would] make the . . . determination about whether he was
 disqualified in light of Mr. Kim's appointment." Judge Gaddis
 ruled that Judge Yoshioka was not disqualified because HRS
 § 601–7(b) only applied to affidavits filed before trial, and
 Attorney Kim's mere appointment as a per diem family court judge
 would not disqualify a sitting Family Court judge from deciding a
 pending case. An order denying the Motion to Disqualify was
 filed on October 2, 2007. 
II.	 STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
Jurisdiction
 
"Questions of jurisdiction are considered de novo." 
Torres v. Torres, 100 Hawai' i 397, 406, 60 P.3d 798, 807 (2002). 
If we determine that we lack jurisdiction to consider the appeal, 
dismissal is warranted. Brooks v. Dana Nance & Co., 113 Hawai' i 
406, 412, 153 P.3d 1091, 1097 (2007). 
Family court decisions
 
Generally, the family court possesses wide discretion
in making its decisions and those decisions will not be set
aside unless there is a manifest abuse of discretion. Thus,
[an appellate court] will not disturb the family court's
decisions on appeal unless the family court disregarded
rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial
detriment of a party litigant and its decision clearly
exceeded the bounds of reason.

Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawai' i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006) 
(quoting In re Doe, 95 Hawai' i 183, 189-90, 20 P.3d 616, 622-23 
(2001)). 
Findings of fact
 
A trial court's finding of fact is reviewed under the 
clearly erroneous standard. Inoue v. Inoue, 118 Hawai' i 86, 92, 
185 P.3d 834, 840 (App. 2008). A finding of fact "is clearly 
erroneous when, despite evidence to support the finding, the appellate court is left with the definite and firm conviction in reviewing the entire evidence that a mistake has been committed." Id. A finding "is also clearly erroneous when the record lacks 
substantial evidence to support the finding. We have defined substantial evidence as credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion." Id. at 92–93, 185 P.3d at 
840–41 (quoting Leslie v. Estate of Tavares, 91 Hawai' i 394, 399, 
984 P.2d 1220, 1225 (1999)) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
Conclusions of law
 
An appellate court reviews a trial court's conclusion 
of law under the right/wrong standard. Chun v. Bd. of Trustees 
of the Employees' Ret. Sys. of the State of Haw., 106 Hawai' i 
416, 430, 106 P.3d 339, 353 (2005) (quoting Allstate Ins. Co. v. Ponce, 105 Hawai' i 445, 453, 99 P.3d 96, 104 (2004)). We will 
not overturn a conclusion of law "that is supported by the trial court's [findings of fact] and that reflects an application of the correct rule of law[.]" Id. (quoting Allstate Ins. Co., 105 
Hawai'i at 453, 99 P.3d at 104) (internal quotations marks 
omitted). "However, a [conclusion of law] that presents mixed questions of fact and law is reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard because the court's conclusions are dependent upon the facts and circumstances of each individual case." Id. (quoting 
Allstate Ins. Co., 105 Hawai' i at 453, 99 P.3d at 104) (internal 
quotations marks omitted). 
Sanctions
 
"[On] appellate review, . . . sanctions . . . are 
reviewed for an abuse of discretion." Webb v. Harvey, 103 
Hawai'i 63, 67 (App. 2003) (quoting Schonleber v. A Reef

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Adventure, Inc., 97 Hawai' i 422, 426, 38 P.3d 590, 594 (App. 
2001). 
Motion to disqualify or recuse a judge
 
The Hawai' i Supreme Court "has adopted the abuse of 
discretion standard for reviewing a judge's denial of a motion 
for recusal or disqualification."  State v. Ortiz, 91 Hawai' i 
181, 188, 981 P.2d 1127, 1134 (1999) (quoting State v. Ross, 89 Hawai'i 371, 376, 974 P.2d 11, 16 (1998)) (internal quotation 
marks and brackets omitted). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
A. The Family Court's June 18, 2007 Decision/Order
 
Hoeflinger argues, in his first and second points of
 
error, that this court lacks jurisdiction to consider his appeal
 because the Family Court (1) failed to divide and distribute all
 of the parties' property under its jurisdiction and (2) failed to
 finally divide all of the parties' property within one year of
 the divorce decree. We disagree.
 
1.	 The Order divided all of the parties' assets and
debts
 
Hawai'i divorce cases involve a maximum of four 
discrete parts: (1) dissolution of the marriage; (2) spousal 
support; (3) child custody, visitation, and support; and (4) division of assets and debts. Eaton v. Eaton, 7 Haw. App.
 
111, 118, 748 P.2d 801, 805 (1987) (citing Black v. Black, 6 Haw.
 App. 493, 728 P.2d 1303, (1986)). Part (4) is only final and
 appealable when the marriage is formally dissolved and when the
 family court fully and finally divides and distributes the
 parties' property within its jurisdiction. Eaton, 7 Haw. App. at
 
119, 748 P.2d at 805; Cleveland v. Cleveland, 57 Haw. 519, 522,
 559 P.2d 744, 747 (1977) (citing In re Doe I, 50 Haw. 537, 444
 P.2d 459 (1968)) (an order is final and appealable if it
 "determines the ultimate rights of the parties, with respect to
 distinct matters which have no bearing on other matters left for
 further consideration" (internal quotation marks omitted)). The
 court may divide and distribute property explicitly or
 implicitly. See Eaton, 7 Haw. App. at 119, 748 P.2d at 806.
 
9
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hoeflinger points to several assets and debts that he
 
claims the Family Court failed to divide and distribute in the
 
Order. Specifically, he points to several debts, a 1992 Lincoln
 Town Car, some furniture at Chen's residence, and several items
 of personal property that were not mentioned in the Decision. 
Hoeflinger argues that, as a result, the Order does not fully and
 finally distribute the parties' assets. 
"When all of the contested property is expressly
 
finally divided, the uncontested property is implicitly finally
 divided on the basis of record title or possession, as
 appropriate." Black, 6 Haw. App. at 495 n.3, 728 P.2d at 1305
 
n.3; Kremkow v. Kremkow, 7 Haw. App. 286, 289, 758 P.2d 197, 199
 (1988) ("All items of property that were not expressly finally
 awarded . . . were thereby implicitly finally awarded to their
 legal owner(s)."). This presumption applies to both "assets and
 liabilities." Black, 6 Haw. App. at 495, 728 P.2d at 1305. Each
 
item addressed by Hoeflinger was either explicitly awarded or was
 uncontested property implicitly divided and distributed by the
 Family Court.
6
 
a. The debts
 
Hoeflinger notes four specific debts that are listed on
 
Chen's Asset and Debt Statement, which he contends were not
 addressed or disributed by the court. The Hilo Medical Center
 debt, however is specifically identified by Chen as her personal
 debt. Each of the three other referenced debts are determinable
 from the record as being incurred post-decree by Chen. By
 implication, then, the Family Court decided that Chen was solely
 responsible for the four debts as her own.
 
6
 The Order states that "[e]ach party is awarded one-half 1/2 of the
remaining assets of the parties consisting of $859,791.81 now in
[Hoeflinger's] control, and the $31,046.60 in Fidelity Investments Accounts
disposed off [sic] or held by [Chen]," after certain adjustments are made,
leaving each party with one-half of $815,961.32. The statement regarding
"one-half 1/2 of the remaining assets" is clearly limited to the sum of the
two pecuniary figures and does not apply to any non-liquid assets not
mentioned in the Order.
 
10
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
b. The Lincoln Town Car
 
Chen claimed that she owned a 1992 Lincoln Town Car and
 
testified at trial that she had been driving the car on a regular
 
basis. The Family Court did not mention the automobile in its
 Decision or Order. By implication, the Family Court awarded the
 Lincoln Town Car, which was already in her possession, to Chen.
 
c. The furniture at Chen's residence
 
The Family Court awarded to Hoeflinger "all of [the]
 
furniture/household goods/artwork in his possession and
 control[.]" By limiting Hoeflinger's award to all of the
 furniture in his possession and under his control, the Family
 Court awarded Chen the remainder of the furniture sub silentio.
 
d. The various personal effects
 
Hoeflinger points to several personal items in various
 
locations that were not explicitly divided and distributed:
 tools, several pictures, and several figurines (some of which
 Chen had already given to him). The Family Court, however,
 awarded the tools to Hoeflinger. Additionally, Chen agreed at
 trial that Hoeflinger could take his tools, pictures, and the
 figurines. In light of Chen's stipulation, the property was
 uncontested and was implicitly divided in Hoeflinger's favor. 
See Kremkow, 7 Haw. App. at 289, 758 P.2d at 199. Thus, the
 issue was properly resolved.
 
Therefore, we hold that the Order fully and finally
 
divided and distributed all of the parties' property in
 compliance with HRS § 580-56(d).
7
 
7
 Hoeflinger cites two cases in support of his position, but they
are ultimately not on point. See Eaton, 7 Haw. App. at 117–19, 748 P.2d at
804–06 (1987) (order not final where the family court left it to the parties
to divide and distribute the remainder of the personal property "in such amanner agreeable to the parties so that each receives approximately equal
value"); Wintermeyer v. Wintermeyer, 114 Hawai' i 96, 99–100, 157 P.3d 535,
538–39 (App. 2006) (order not final where the family court divided unique
property equally between the parties without identifying how the division anddistribution would be accomplished). 
11
   
  
 
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
2. The Order was timely
 
If a decree or order reserves the final division of 
property, a family court loses jurisdiction to divide the 
litigants' property after one year from that decree or order or upon the earlier issuance of a timely order fully dividing the parties' property. H
AW. REV. STAT. § 580-56(d) (2006); Boulton, 
69 Haw. at 5, 730 P.2d at 340. Jurisdiction is retained, however, to subsequently enforce an otherwise timely property division order. Richter v. Richter, 108 Hawai' i 504, 506–07, 122 
P.3d 284, 286–87 (App. 2005). In addition, various other exceptions to the rule have been recognized. See infra section 
III.G.
 
Here, the Decree was filed on July 17, 2006. The 
Decision, entered on June 18, 2007, did not merely state findings of fact and conclusions of law; it also contained the Order, which divided the parties' property and addressed all remaining claims. Because the Hawai' i Family Court Rules ("HFCR") do not 
require that a judgment be entered on a separate document, an order may be final and appealable "as long as the appealed order ends the litigation by fully deciding the rights and liabilities of all parties and leaves nothing further to be adjudicated." See Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai' i 425, 427, 984 P.2d 
1251, 1253 (1999) (no separate document required where such a requirement was not plainly mandated). 
While the Family Court ordered Chen's counsel to draft 
a judgment consistent with the Decision pursuant to HFCR Rule 58, nothing in the HFCR prohibits a family court from entering its own final order. The October 2, 2007 Judgment, which restated how the property was to be divided, was unnecessary and ultimately redundant. Cf. Poe v. Haw. Labor Relations Bd., 98 
Hawai'i 416, 418, 49 P.3d 382, 384 (2002) (if an amendment to a 
final decree does not have an adverse effect on the "rights or obligations determined by the prior [decree] . . . or the parties' right to appeal, the entry of the amended judgment will not postpone the time within which an appeal must be taken from the original decree" (citation omitted)). Therefore, the Family 
Court fully and finally divided the parties' assets within one 
12

year of the Decree in compliance with HRS § 580-56(d).
 
B. Post-Nuptial Agreement
 
The Family Court found that Chen did not enter into the
 
Post-Nuptial Agreement voluntarily and that the agreement was
 
unconscionable. Hoeflinger challenges the Family Court's
 findings. We agree that the Family Court erred with regard to
 voluntariness and that the court's findings do not support its
 conclusion of unconscionability.
 
We begin with the principle that "[a]ll contracts made
 
between spouses, whenever made . . . and not otherwise invalid
 because of any other law, shall be valid." H
AW. REV. STAT. § 572­
22 (2006). As applied here, HRS § 572-22 "authorizes and
 requires the family court to order [a] conveyance" that was
 agreed to in a valid and enforceable marital agreement. Labayog
 
v. Labayog, 83 Hawai' i 412, 428, 927 P.2d 420, 436 (App. 1996). 
Whether pre- or post-nuptial, marital agreements are 
enforceable if the agreement "is not unconscionable and has been voluntarily entered into by the parties with knowledge of the financial situation of the prospective spouse[.]" Epp v. Epp, 80 
Hawai'i 79, 85, 905 P.2d 54, 60 (App. 1995) (quoting Lewis v. 
Lewis, 69 Haw. 497, 500–01, 748 P.2d 1362, 1366 (1988)). Involuntariness is shown by evidence of "duress, coercion, undue influence, or any other circumstance indicating lack of free will or voluntariness." Prell v. Silverstein, 114 Hawai' i 286, 298, 
162 P.3d 2, 14 (App. 2007). Unconscionability, on the other hand, encompasses one-sidedness and unfair surprise. Id. at 297, 
162 P.3d at 13. One-sidedness means that the agreement "leaves a post-divorce economic situation that is unjustly disproportionate." Id. (quoting Lewis, 69 Haw. at 502, 748 P.2d 
at 1366). Unfair surprise means "that one party did not have full and adequate knowledge of the other party's financial condition when the [marital] agreement was executed." Id. 
(quoting Lewis, 69 Haw. at 502, 748 P.2d at 1366). A contract that is merely "inequitable" is not unenforceable under contract law. Lewis, 69 Haw. at 500, 748 P.2d at 1365-66.

1. Voluntariness
 
The Family Court found that the Post-Nuptial Agreement
 
"does not contain a disclosure of the parties' respective assets
 
and debts and no written disclosure of [Hoeflinger]'s assets and
 debts was given to [Chen]." The Family Court further found that
 "based upon the relationship of the parties, and [Hoeflinger]'s
 independent business dealings (e.g., Duntip Industrial, Inc.),
 that [Chen] was not fully aware of the scope and value of all of
 [Hoeflinger]'s assets." The court concluded that the Post-
Nuptial Agreement was unenforceable because Chen did not enter
 into the agreement voluntarily "due to the absence of knowledge
 as to the scope and value of [Hoeflinger]'s assets[.]" 
Hoeflinger argues that, among other things, the Family 
Court erred because Chen's knowledge of Hoeflinger's financial situation was irrelevant to the issue of voluntariness and there is no other evidence supporting the conclusion that Chen's assent was not voluntarily given. We agree that if Chen lacked knowledge of Hoeflinger's financial condition, it speaks to unconscionability, not the voluntariness of her acceptance. See 
Prell, 114 Hawai' i at 297, 162 P.3d at 13. In sum, the Family 
Court's finding that Chen lacked knowledge of Hoeflinger's financial condition does not support its conclusion that Chen's assent to the Post-Nupital Agreement was involuntarily given. 
2. Unconscionability
 
As an alternative basis for unenforceability, the
 
Family Court held that the Post-Nuptial Agreement was
 unconscionable because "in the event of a divorce, it compelled
 [Chen] to relinquish her interest in the parties' marital
 residence which is the single most valuable asset[] of the
 marriage. The residence which is valued at $368,000.00 is
 equivalent to 41% of all the Category 5 assets . . . available
 for distribution." 
Hoeflinger argues that (1) the Family Court utilized
 
the value of the Marital Residence at the time of trial in its
 unconscionability analysis instead of the Marital Residence's
 value at the time of the execution of the Post-Nuptial Agreement,
 
14
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2) Chen had substantial assets at the time of the Post-Nuptial
 
Agreement, (3) lack of full awareness "of the scope and value of
 all of [Hoeflinger]'s assets" is not the same thing as "full and
 adequate knowledge of the other party's financial condition," and
 
(4) Chen had actual knowledge of Hoeflinger's financial
 condition.
 
"[T]he issue of unconscionability of a provision 
governing division of property in a premarital agreement should be evaluated at the time the agreement was executed." Prell, 114 
Hawai
'i at 297, 162 P.3d at 13 (quoting Lewis, 69 Haw. at 507, 
748 P.2d at 1369). The Marital Residence was appraised to be $379,000 as of September 14, 2006. Nothing indicates that this was the value of the Marital Residence on or about June 6, 2001, the date the parties signed the Post-Nuptial Agreement. It is unclear what the value of the Marital Residence was as of June 6, 2001. Therefore, the Family Court's reliance on the September 14, 2006 appraisal was in error. Given the lack of any other findings or conclusions on point, we cannot determine whether the Post-Nuptial Agreement is too one-sided without further findings or conclusions by the Family Court. See Lewis, 69 Haw. at 504, 
748 P.2d at 1368 (further proceedings necessary when the record unclear on the issue of one-sidedness).
8 
Similarly, it is not clear whether the record supports
 
the Family Court's finding that Chen was "not fully aware of the
 scope and value of all of [Hoeflinger]'s assets." This finding
 in and of itself is vague, and the Family Court did not apply it
 to the issue of unconscionability. The Family Court failed to
 explain how "the relationship of the parties[] and [Hoeflinger]'s
 independent business dealings" establish that Chen lacked
 knowledge of Hoeflinger's financial condition. Consequently, we
 are unable to determine on what basis this finding was made, how
 it relates to the unconscionability issue, and whether it was
 clearly erroneous for the court to make it. Due to the lack of
 clarity on the issue of unconscionability, we vacate Findings 34
 and 35 of the Decision, and Distribution "i" of the Order, and
 
8
 The value of Chen's assets on June 6, 2001 is also relevant to the
issue of one-sidedness.

remand for more definite findings and conclusions and, if
 
necessary, redivision and redistribution of the parties'
 property.

C. Waste of marital assets
 
Hoeflinger argues that the Family Court erred in
 
finding that Hoeflinger wasted marital assets in September 1995
 
and by deducting the value of the waste from Hoeflinger's post­marital share. 
Waste of marital assets is chargeable to a divorcing 
party "when, during the time of the divorce, a party's action or inaction caused a reduction of the dollar value of the marital estate under such circumstances that he or she equitably should be charged with having received the dollar value of the reduction." Higashi v. Higashi, 106 Hawai' i 228, 241, 103 P.3d 
388, 401 (App. 2004). "By definition a reduction of the value of the marital estate during the marriage, but prior to the time of the divorce, is not a chargeable reduction." Id.; cf. Schiller 
v. Schiller, 120 Hawai' i 283, 298-303, 205 P.3d 548, 563-68 (App. 
2009) (family court has wide discretion to determine post-separation wasting of assets). 
Here, Chen filed the complaint for divorce on
 
November 4, 2005. The Family Court charged Hoeflinger with
 depleting the marital estate by $94,000 through gifts to his
 children and business connections in September 1995, more than
 ten years before Chen filed for divorce. Because the purported
 waste occurred prior to the time of divorce, the Family Court
 erred by deducting the value of such waste from Hoeflinger's
 marital share. Therefore, we vacate Adjustment "A" of the Order,
 and Findings 12 and 18 of the Decision, to the extent that they
 pertain to the wasting of assets. We remand for recalculation
 and redivision of the assets consistent with our holding.

 The Family Court has jurisdiction to redivide and redistribute the
parties' assets on remand. See our discussion in section III.G. infra.

D. Premarital economic partnership
 
Hoeflinger contends that the Family Court's conclusion 
that the parties had a premarital economic partnership prior to 
their official marriage on March 1, 1995 was erroneous, arguing that (1) the Family Court erred in finding that Chen and Hoeflinger formed a premarital economic partnership; (2) Chen violated HFCR Rule 94(a) because she never raised the issue of a premarital economic partnership in her position statement filed on May 19, 2006; (3) because cohabitation is illegal in the PRC, the Family Court was "precluded from applying Hawai' i's 
premarital cohabitation law to an event that occurred in PRC"; and (4) he was still married to someone else during a part of the premarital economic partnership. 
1. Findings of fact supported the conclusion
 
A premarital economic partnership "occurs when, prior 
to their subsequent marriage, a man and a woman cohabit and apply their financial resources as well as their individual energies and efforts to and for the benefit of each other's person, assets, and liabilities." Helbush v. Helbush, 108 Hawai' i 508, 
515, 122 P.3d 288, 295 (App. 2005). 
The Family Court found that Chen moved into
 
Hoeflinger's residence in July 1992. The Family Court found that
 while Chen lived with Hoeflinger, "she was employed at a hospital
 and she utilized her income to pay for the household expenses
 such as food and supplies to which [Hoeflinger] also contributed
 when [Chen's] income was insufficient." It also found that the
 parties "were enjoying all of the conjugal benefits as if they
 were husband and wife" from July 1992. 
Thus, we conclude that the Family Court did not err in
 
determining that the parties had established a premarital
 economic partnership.
11
 
11
 Hoeflinger's argument that there was no premarital economic
partnership because Chen did not contribute to or enhance the parties' assets
is without merit. Under the definition provided in Helbush, an economic
partnership occurs when the parties "apply their financial resources as well
(continued...)

2. No abuse of discretion
 
Pursuant to HFCR Rule 94(a), a party shall file "a
 
written statement specifying the [party's] position on all the
 
issues and such other documents as may be required by the court." 
Hoeflinger argues that the Family Court should not have
 considered Chen's claim of a premarital economic partnership
 because Chen failed to address the issue in her position
 statement. Furthermore, Hoeflinger notes that Rule 94(c), HFCR,
 provides sanctions for parties failing to comply with the rule.
 
In her position statement, however, Chen explained that 
she and Hoeflinger "had a three year courtship prior to the marriage." This was sufficient to put Hoeflinger on notice that the court might explore the extent and nature of their premarital relationship.  See Helbush, 108 Hawai' i at 513-15, 122 P.3d at 
293-95. The Family Court, therefore, did not abuse its discretion in considering the premarital economic partnership issue, and in refusing to sanction Chen under HFCR Rule 94(c) by disregarding her claim of a premarital economic partnership. 
3. Hawai'i law governs 
HRS § 580-47 "gives to the family court the discretion 
to divide marital property according to what is just and equitable[.]" Myers v. Myers, 70 Haw. 143, 148, 764 P.2d 1237, 
1241 (1988) (quoting Cassiday v. Cassiday, 68 Haw, 383, 388 716 P.2d 1133, 1137 (1986)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Cohabitation alone does not entitle a cohabitant to property division under HRS § 580-47. Aehegma v. Aehegma, 8 Haw. App. 
215, 221–22, 797 P.2d 74, 79 (1990). However, a family court can consider the parties' contributions during the premarital economic partnership if "premarital cohabitation matured into marriage." Helbush, 108 Hawai' i at 515, 122 P.3d at 294–95; 
11(...continued)
as their individual energies and efforts to and for the benefit of each
other's person, assets, and liabilities." 
108 Hawai' i 508, 515, 122 P.3d 288,
295 (App. 2005). When Chen paid for food and supplies for the benefit ofHoeflinger, it enhanced and supported Hoeflinger. Hoeflinger fails to showerror. 
18
   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Malek v. Malek, 7 Haw. App. 377, 380, 768 P.2d 243, 246 (1989)
 
(the family court's discretion when dividing and distributing
 property and debts in divorce cases is not restricted to
 considering only what happened after marriage).
 
In opposition, Hoeflinger first asserts that because 
the cohabitation occurred in the PRC, where cohabitation is supposedly illegal, Hawai' i courts must not find the existence of 
a premarital economic partnership because "[n]either [party] could expect that their alleged premarital cohabitation in the PRC, deemed illegal by the laws of the PRC, would have any meaning to their divorce action in Hawaii." Hoeflinger cites to Peters v. Peters, 63 Haw. 653, 634 P.2d 586 (1981) in support of his argument. 
In Peters, a couple from New York on vacation was 
involved in a vehicular accident in Hawai' i when Husband, driving 
a "U-Drive" vehicle, collided with a truck. Id. at 655, 634 P.2d 
at 588. Wife, who was a passenger, sued husband in Hawai' i for 
personal injuries. Id. Under Hawai' i law at the time, spouses 
were immune from suits brought by their spouses, while New York law allowed a spouse to sue his or her spouse for personal injury. Id. at 658–60, 660 n.11, 634 P.2d at 590–91, 591 n.11. 
Holding Hawai' i law to be applicable, the Supreme Court stated 
that because "U-Drive" vehicles leased in Hawai' i are 
geographically restricted to use in-state, the application of New York law in this case would "contravene the expectations of both insurer and lessor." Id. at 666, 634 P.2d at 594. 
Peters is inapposite. We are not confronted with 
diametrically opposed laws. Instead, the Family Court may consider the nature of the parties' relationship prior to marriage and, indeed, "all other circumstances of the case." H
AW. REV. STAT. § 580-47(a). Whether cohabitation is illegal in 
the PRC does not affect the Family Court's determination whether prior to their marriage, Chen and Hoeflinger lived together and supported each other financially such that they established a premarital economic partnership under Hawai' i law. It was within 
the Family Court's wide discretion to use this information to formulate a just and equitable division of the parties' property. 
19
   
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Second, Hoeflinger argues that "if the marriage under 
China law of the parties in the PRC is given full faith and 
credit in Hawaii, the illegality under China law of the parties' premarital cohabitation in the PRC should also be given full faith and credit in Hawaii." Foreign marriages are specifically recognized by statute. See H
AW. REV. STAT. § 572-3 (2006) 
("Marriages between a man and a woman legal in the country where contracted shall be held legal in the courts of this State."). By Hoeflinger's logic, because Hawai' i recognizes PRC marriages, 
we must also follow all other PRC laws related to marriage. Hoeflinger cites no support for his argument, and we hold that it is without merit. 
Finally, Hoeflinger argues that "[i]f the [Family
 
Court's] conclusion stands, that a premarital economic
 partnership can occur even when a party is still married to
 someone else, it means that a party can be subjected to two
 divisions of marital property at the same time from different
 partners."
12 Contrary to Hoeflinger's argument, HRS § 580-47
 
does not provide for the division of property for mere
 cohabitation; therefore, Hoeflinger could not be subject to
 simultaneous divisions of marital property from different
 partners under the statute. See Aehegma, 8 Haw. App. at 221–22,
 
797 P.2d at 79. In this case, it does not contravene a just and
 equitable division of property to consider the parties'
 premarital cohabitation, even though one of the parties might
 have been legally married to someone else at that time. See
 
Coney v. Coney, 503 A.2d 912 (N.J. Super. Ct. Ch. Div. 1985)
 (property acquired by parties who later married, and who were
 cohabitating while married to others, constituted property
 acquired during the marriage and equitably distributed upon
 divorce). Here, Hoeflinger and his prior wife entered into a
 Property Settlement effective on January 26, 1993, six months
 after the Family Court found that Hoeflinger and Chen established
 a premarital economic partnership commencing in July 1992. There
 
12
 Hoeflinger argues that while the Family Court found that
Hoeflinger's premarital economic partnership with Chen began in July 1992, his
previous marriage did not end until December 13, 1993. 
20
   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
is nothing in the record to suggest, and Hoeflinger does not
 
assert, that any of the property at issue in this case was also
 subject to the Property Settlement with his prior wife.
 
For the aforementioned reasons, we hold that the Family
 
Court did not err when it concluded that Chen and Hoeflinger
 formed a premarital economic partnership beginning in July
 1992.
13
 
E. Motion to disqualify
 
Hoeflinger contends that the Family Court erred in
 
denying his motion to disqualify Judge Yoshioka, and further
 
erred in allowing Judge Yoshioka to continue participating in the
 case after he initially conditionally recused the entire Family
 Court from the case.
 
Hawai'i courts apply a two-part analysis in 
disqualification or recusal cases. State v. Ross, 89 Hawai' i 
371, 377, 974 P.2d 11, 17 (1998). First, courts determine 
whether the alleged bias is covered by HRS § 601-7, which only pertains to cases of affinity or consanguinity, financial interest, prior participation, and actual judicial bias or prejudice. Id.; H
AW. REV. STAT. § 601–7. This first step refers 
to judicial "disqualification." See Hawai' i Revised Code of 
Judicial Conduct Rule 2.11 Code Comparison (2008) (in Hawai' i 
jurisprudence, the terms "disqualification" and "recusal" are not synonymous); Report and Recommendation of the Committee to Evaluate Hawaii's Revised Code of Judicial Conduct 1, 7 (April 10, 2008), http://www.state.hi.us/jud/ctrules/CommRptJud JudConduct.pdf ("2008 RCJC Report") ("disqualification" refers to 
13
 Hoeflinger identifies no practical consequence of the Family
Court's conclusion that a premarital economic partnership was established.
Indeed, the Family Court in the Decision merely analyzes the facts surrounding
the relationship, reaches its conclusion that as a result there was a
premarital economic partnership, notes that "[n]otwithstanding this
determination, the Court does not consider the parties' pre-marital economic
partnership to warrant a deviation from marital partnership principles[.]"
Instead, the Family Court reserves the matter for future consideration as a
valid and relevant consideration in the event that error is subsequently
determined. Since we conclude that the Family Court did not err in finding a
premarital economic partnership, and since we remand the case for further
proceedings, it is for the Family Court to consider first whether any
variation from marital partnership principles is warranted in light of its
finding of a premarital economic partnership.
 
21
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"disqualification pursuant to HRS § 601-7 due to kinship,
 
pecuniary interest, prior involvement, personal bias or
 prejudice"). 
Second, if HRS § 601-7 does not apply, courts "may then 
turn, if appropriate, to the notions of due process . . . in conducting the broader inquiry of whether 'circumstances . . . fairly give rise to an appearance of impropriety and . . . reasonably cast suspicion on [the judge's] impartiality." Ross, 
89 Hawai' i at 377, 974 P.2d at 17 (brackets and ellipses in 
original) (quoting State v. Brown, 70 Haw. 459, 467 n.3, 776 P.2d 1182, 1188 n.3 (1989)). A judge who ceases participating because of due-process concerns "recuses" him or herself. 2008 RCJC Report at 7 (under Ross, "recusal" refers to "disqualification outside HRS § 601–7 due to the appearance of impropriety"). 
1. The motion was untimely
 
Under HRS § 601-7(b), a disqualifying affidavit "shall 
be filed before the trial or hearing of the action or proceeding, or good cause shall be shown for the failure to file it within such time." "[A] party asserting grounds for disqualification must timely present the objection, either before the commencement of the proceeding or as soon as the disqualifying facts become known." Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Au, 107 Hawai' i 327, 
338, 113 P.3d 203, 214 (2005) (quoting In re Water Use Permit Applications, 94 Hawai' i 97, 122, 9 P.3d 409, 434 (2000)) 
(internal quotation marks omitted). "Litigants cannot take the heads-I-win-tails-you-lose position of waiting to see whether they win and if they lose moving to disqualify a judge who voted against them. . . . The requirement of timeliness prohibits knowing concealment of an ethical issue for strategic purposes." Id. at 339, 113 P.3d at 215 (quoting Schurz Commc'ns, Inc. v. Fed. Commc'ns Comm'n, 982 F.2d 1057, 1060 (7th Cir. 1993)) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
Here, Hoeflinger's counsel learned that Attorney Kim
 
had been appointed a per diem family court judge on May 4, 2007,
 after trial had concluded, but before the Decision was issued. 
Hoeflinger remained silent. Judge Yoshioka issued his Decision,
 
22
   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
which was adverse to Hoeflinger, on June 18, 2007. Hoeflinger
 
did not file a disqualifying affidavit until July 11, 2007. 
Judge Yoshioka noted, before ultimately recusing
 
himself from deciding the disqualification issue, that
 Hoeflinger's counsel knew about Attorney Kim's appointment before
 the Court issued the Decision, but failed to raise the issue and
 had thereby waived the objection. Judge Gaddis ultimately held
 that the affidavit was untimely because it needed to be filed
 before trial. 
Judge Gaddis failed to explain that a disqualifying 
affidavit may be filed after trial for good cause, and that Hoeflinger's counsel did not learn of Attorney Kim's appointment until after trial. But Judge Gaddis generally recognized a fact that is crystal clear from the record: the affidavit was filed far too late. It took an adverse decision (and over two months) for Hoeflinger to file an affidavit alleging bias. That is exactly what a party is prohibited from doing. Therefore, we affirm Judge Gaddis's order denying the Motion to Disqualify. See State v. Koch, 107 Hawai' i 215, 224, 112 P.3d 69, 78 (2005) 
(no error if the trial court reaches the right result for the wrong reason). 
2. Personal bias or prejudice
 
As an alternate basis for denying the Motion to
 
Disqualify, Judge Gaddis held that the fact of Attorney Kim's
 appointment was insufficient to disqualify the presiding family
 court judge from deciding the case even though Attorney Kim
 participated at trial. 
The most important document in any motion to disqualify 
based on personal bias is the party's affidavit. See Schutter v. 
Soong, 76 Hawai' i 187, 205, 873 P.2d 66, 84 (1994). If a party 
to a suit files an affidavit that the judge "has a personal bias or prejudice either against the party or in favor of any opposite party to the suit, the judge shall be disqualified from proceeding therein." H
AW. REV. STAT. § 601-7(b). 
Disqualification is not automatic simply because a
 
party files an affidavit. The affidavit must "state the facts
 
23
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and the reasons for the belief that bias or prejudice exists[,]" 
id., and "must be sufficient for a sane and reasonable mind to fairly infer bias or prejudice." Jou v. Schmidt, 117 Hawai' i 
477, 483, 184 P.3d 792, 798 (App. 2008) (quoting Glover v. Fong, 39 Haw. 308, 314–15 (Haw. Terr. 1952)) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
Hoeflinger attested to his belief that Judge Yoshioka
 
has a personal bias or prejudice against him. He stated that
 those beliefs were based on his own unspecific "personal
 feelings" that became clear when he learned that Attorney Kim was
 appointed as a per diem family court judge. He contended that it
 was clear that Judge Yoshioka was biased against him because the
 judge found his testimony "not credible." Hoeflinger further
 argued that Attorney Kim's appointment "created an ongoing
 personal relationship" between Attorney Kim and Judge Yoshioka,
 irrespective of how much Attorney Kim and Judge Yoshioka actually
 interacted or socialized as judicial colleagues. 
Hoeflinger's "own personal feelings," however, are not
 
facts or reasons supporting his belief. The fact that Judge
 Yoshioka found Hoeflinger to be not credible does not evidence
 bias against him. See Haw.-Pac. Venture Capital Corp. v.
 
Rothbard, 437 F. Supp. 230, 234 (D. Haw. 1977) (bias "cannot be
 founded upon a judge's findings of fact and expression of
 judicial opinion arising out of the very case in which his
 disqualification is sought"). Hoeflinger's speculative belief
 that Judge Yoshioka was biased against him because Attorney Kim
 was appointed a per diem family court judge while the case was
 under consideration is all that remains. Hoeflinger cites no
 evidence tending to show bias on the part of Judge Yoshioka. 
Therefore, Judge Gaddis did not abuse his discretion in finding
 that disqualification was improper. 
3. Appearance of impropriety
 
Because HRS § 601-7 does not apply, we must determine 
whether due process required recusal at the time of Attorney Kim's appointment to the bench. Ross, 89 Hawai' i at 377, 974 
P.2d at 17. The circumstances here did not give rise to the 
24
   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
probability of unfairness or the temptation for the judge to
 
forget the applicable burden of proof. Id. at 379, 974 P.2d at
 
19. Hoeflinger's claim does not rise to a constitutional
 
dimension. Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Lavoie, 475 U.S. 813, 829
 
(1986) (stating that "only in the most extreme cases would
 disqualification on [the basis of allegations of bias or
 prejudice against a judge] be constitutionally required"). The
 argument here is without merit.
 
4. Prospective recusal
 
Hoeflinger argues that "Judge Yoshioka initially
 
recused himself and the entire family court from the case," which
 precludes "anyone in the family court from acting in the case." 
Although Judge Yoshioka's ruling is somewhat confusing, he
 recused himself from the case for all matters moving forward,
 stating that "the Court is gonna recuse itself, and it's gonna
 recuse all family court judges" with relation to "issues relating
 to the motion for reconsideration because of Mr. Kim's
 participation as . . . counsel for Miss Chen." Judge Yoshioka
 cleanly distinguished the act of recusal from disqualification: 
"We're [(Judge Yoshioka and the Family Court)] not disqualified
 –– I don't feel I'm disqualified because . . . as Mr. Kim pointed
 out, um, there are maybe deficiencies in the, uh, affidavit, but
 I don't feel it's necessary to rule on that at this point. We're
 recusing –– the Family Court is recusing itself." Therefore, the
 question presented is whether a judge who recuses himself from a
 case may later preside after the basis for recusal is removed.
 
As an initial matter, because the Decision and Order
 
were entered before the Family Court conditionally recused
 itself, Hoeflinger's prospective recusal argument, even if
 correct, would not invalidate the Decision or Order. However,
 because this issue has implications on remand, it remains ripe
 for adjudication on appeal.
 
Under the common law, disqualification because of a
 
"relationship to a litigant or attorney[] may be removed after
 the inception of the action or proceeding with the effect of
 rendering it proper for the judge to reassume jurisdiction in the
 
25

case." W.W. Allen, Annotation, Disqualification of Judge in
 
Pending Case as Subject to Revocation or Removal, 162 A.L.R. 641
 (1946).  And this remains the majority position today. See Luce
 
v. Cushing 868 A.2d 672, 677–78 (Vt. 2004), and cases cited
 therein. "In the absence of a statute to the contrary, where a
 timely affirmative showing is made that there was no valid
 disqualification or the disqualification has been removed, a
 judge who entered an order that he or she is disqualified may
 reassume jurisdiction over the matter," if the judge revokes the
 disqualification order. 46 A
M. JUR. 2D Judges § 221 (2006).
 
Due process requires that a judge disqualify himself 
"where circumstances g[i]ve rise to the 'probability of unfairness' and 'temptation to the judge to forget'" the applicable burden of proof. Ross, 89 Hawai' i at 379, 974 P.2d at 
19 (quoting Brown, 70 Haw. at 466, 467, 776 P.2d 1187-88). This requirement is based on the Hawai' i Revised Code of Judicial 
Conduct
14 "and the general principle that justice must satisfy 
the appearance of justice." Id. (quoting Brown, 70 Haw. at 467, 
776 P.2d at 1188) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, 
as stated earlier, "only in the most extreme cases would 
disqualification on [the basis of allegations of bias or prejudice against a judge] be constitutionally required." Aetna 
Life Ins. Co., 475 U.S. at 829. Instead, due process is violated only in those circumstances "in which experience teaches that the probability of actual bias on the part of the judge or decisionmaker is too high to be constitutionally tolerable." Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., 556 U.S. 868, __, 129 S. Ct. 2252, 2259 (2009) (quoting Withrow v. Larkin, 421 U.S. 35, 47 (1975)) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
Due process does not prohibit a judge from reentering
 
the case after recusal if the condition causing his or her
 recusal is removed from the case. If the prejudicial barrier is
 explicitly stated in the record to be the sole basis for recusal,
 
14
 The Hawai' i Revised Code of Judicial Conduct in effect in 2007 was 
not authority upon which parties could demand recusal or overturn a court
order or judgment. See Ross, 89 Hawai' i at 379 n.7, 974 P.2d at 19 n.7;
Hawai'i Revised Code of Judicial Conduct, Preamble (1992) (stating that the
purpose of the Code is to provide guidance). 
26
   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the elimination of that barrier removes the probability of 
unfairness and the temptation to decide the case on anything other than the merits. The judge is no longer tainted: the judicial system "rests on the premise that 'the law will not suppose a possibility of bias or favour in a judge, who is already sworn to administer impartial justice, and whose authority greatly depends upon that presumption and idea.'" Ross, 89 Hawai' i at 381, 974 P.2d at 21 (quoting Aetna Life Ins. 
Co., 475 U.S. at 820). 
Here, Judge Yoshioka explicitly conditioned recusal on
 
Attorney Kim's continued representation of Chen. Once Attorney
 Kim withdrew ten days later, there was no longer any continuing
 basis for the Family Court's recusal. The concerns justifying
 recusal — probability of unfairness and temptation to disregard
 legal standards of proof — no longer existed. Likewise, any
 appearance of impropriety necessarily vanished. Judge Nakamura
 ceded whatever control he had over the case back to the Family
 Court. Judge Gaddis decided the motion. We determine no basis
 upon which Judge Yoshioka and the Family Court's subsequent
 participation in the case violated due process. Cf. 46 A
M. JUR.
 
2D Judges § 220 (2006) ("A judge who recuses himself or herself
 
due to a friendship with counsel for one of the parties may
 revoke the recusal and reenter the case where the attorney
 withdraws from the case[.]").
 
The two cases that Hoeflinger cites in support of his
 
position are unpersuasive.
15 In El Fenix de Puerto Rico v. The
 
M/Y Johanny, 36 F.3d 136 (1st Cir. 1994), a judge disqualified
 himself pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 455(a).
16 36 F.3d at 139. After
 
defendants filed a motion for reconsideration, the judge vacated
 
15
 State v. Clarke, 857 So. 2d 599 (La. Ct. App. 2003), is grounded
in the Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure and, as a result, bears little
resemblance to this case.
 
16
 Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 455(a), "Any justice, judge, or magistrate
judge of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which
his impartiality might reasonably be questioned." This language is, for all
intents and purposes, a statutory codification of former Canon 3E(1), in
effect in 2007, which stated, "A judge shall disqualify himself or herself in
a proceeding in which the judge's impartiality might reasonably be
questioned[.]"
 
27
     
  
 
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the recusal order. Id. While holding that the motion for
 
disqualification under § 455(a) should have been denied in the
 
first instance, the appellate court reversed, stating that "a
 trial judge who has recused himself 'should take no other action
 in the case except the necessary ministerial acts to have the
 case transferred to another judge.'" Id. at 140–41 (quoting what
 is today 13D C
HARLES A. WRIGHT, ET AL., FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE
 
§ 3550 (3d ed. 2008)).  The First Circuit Court of Appeals
 
reasoned that its decision was influenced heavily by the
 litigants' constitutional entitlement to an unbiased adjudication
 and the public's perception of the integrity of the judicial
 process. Id. at 142 n.7. While these values are legitimate due
 
process concerns, we see no reason to adopt a prophylactic per se
 rule in derogation of the common law without a statutory basis.
17
 
Therefore, we find no error.
 
F. Motion to expedite
 
Hoeflinger's final point of error states that the
 
Family Court erred by denying Hoeflinger's ex parte motion to
 
expedite a hearing on his Motion for Reconsideration and by
 granting two continuances. Hoeflinger fails to present an
 argument in support of his seventh point of error; thus, the
 point is waived. Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(7).
 
G. The Family Court's jurisdiction on remand

court's jurisdiction to issue post-decree property distribution
 
orders

accepted in the federal circuit courts. See United States v. Lauersen, 348
F.3d 329, 338 (2d Cir. 2003) ("There is no reason to prohibit a judge from
reconsidering a recusal decision, at least in the absence of transfer of the
case to another judge."); United States v. Dalfonso, 707 F.2d 757, 759 (3d
Cir. 1983); Central Teleph. Co. of Va. v. Sprint Comm. Co. of Va., No.

participation appropriate when no recusal order was entered and the case was
not reassigned).

 We have previously explained the effect that HRS § 580-56(d) has
on the family court's jurisdiction to divide and distribute the parties'
property:
 
(continued...)
 
28
   
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appellate courts since the provision was amended in 1973. See
 
Boulton, 69 Haw. at 6–7, 730 P.2d at 341 (Wakatsuki, J.,
 
dissent). Nevertheless, the specific situation that we consider
 — the family court's jurisdiction upon remand from an appellate
 court of a timely-decided property division order — has rarely
 been encountered and never to our knowledge explicitly addressed. 
The statutory provisions central to the question read:
 
An order as to the custody, management, and division
of property and as to the payment of debts and the
attorney's fees, costs and expenses incurred in the divorce
shall be final and conclusive as to both parties subject
only to appeal as in civil cases. The court shall at all
 times, including during the pendency of any appeal, have the
power to grant any and all orders that may be necessary to
protect and provide for the support and maintenance of the
parties and any children of the parties to secure justice,
to compel either party to advance reasonable amounts for the
expenses of the appeal including attorney's fees to be
incurred by the other party, and to amend and revise such
orders from time to time.
 
HAW. REV. STAT. § 580-47(b).
 
Following the entry of a decree of divorce, or the
entry of a decree or order finally dividing the property of
the parties to a matrimonial action if the same is reserved
in the decree of divorce, or the elapse of one year after
entry of a decree or order reserving the final division of
property of the party, a divorced spouse shall not be
entitled to dower or curtesy in the former spouse's real
estate, or any part thereof, nor to any share of the former
spouse's personal estate.
 
HAW. REV. STAT. § 580-56(d). The question here is whether HRS
 
§ 580-56(d) divests the family court of jurisdiction to issue
 
further property distribution orders in response to this order of
 
18(...continued)
HRS § 580-56(d) provides that "a divorced spouse shall not
be entitled to . . . any share of the former spouse's
personal estate" in the following three situations:
 
1.
 Following the entry of a decree of divorce which
does not reserve the final division of the property of the
parties. See De Mello v. De Mello, 3 Haw. App. 165, 646
P.2d 409 (1982).
 
2. Following the entry of a decree or order finally
dividing the property of the parties to a matrimonial action
if the same is reserved in the decree of divorce.
 
3. Following the elapse of one year after entry of a
decree or order reserving the final division of the
property. See Boulton v. Boulton, 69 Haw. 1, 730 P.2d 338
(1986)
 
Kremkow v. Kremkow, 7 Haw. App. 286, 289, 758 P.2d 197, 199–200 (1988).

remand. Our answer is no. 
"The time limit specified in HRS § 580-56(d) pertains 
to the family court's jurisdiction to resolve the property 
division issue and to decide how the property of the parties will be distributed." Richter, 108 Hawai' i at 506–07, 122 P.3d at 
286–87 (citation omitted). Expanding on that principle, we have held that HFCR Rule 60(b)(6) does not authorize the family court to reconsider its final division of the parties' property when the request for reconsideration is based upon a non-retroactive "mere" change in the relevant case law. Hammon v. Monsef, 8 Haw. 
App. 58, 64, 792 P.2d 311, 314 (1990); see also Kremkow, 7 Haw. App. at 289, 758 P.2d at 199 (HRS § 580-56(d) divests the family court of its HFCR Rule 60(b)(1) jurisdiction to divide the parties' property in each of the three situations identified supra n. 19). 
HRS § 580-56(d) does not, however, resolve all issues 
relating to post-division property orders. It does not, for instance, pertain to enforcement of property division orders stated in a divorce decree that finally divided the parties' property. Richter, 108 Hawai' i at 507, 122 P.3d at 287; see also 
Magoon v. Magoon, 70 Haw. 605, 615–16, 780 P.2d 80, 86–87 (1989) (HRS § 580-56(d) does not divest the family court of jurisdiction to redivide marital property in response to an HFCR Rule 60(b) motion alleging fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of the adverse party); Greene v. Greene, 8 Haw. App. 559, 567, 815 P.2d 28, 31 (1991) (HRS § 580-56(d) does not divest the family court of jurisdiction to decide HFCR Rule 60(b)(6) motions based upon a retroactive change in a relevant federal law); Kano v. Kano, 8 Haw. App. 172, 178, 799 P.2d 55, 58 (1990) (HRS § 580­56(d) does not divest the family court of jurisdiction to redivide marital property in response to an HFCR Rule 60(b)(3) motion alleging fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct). 
The critical feature in these cases is the balance
 
between the interest in finality of judgments advanced by HRS
 § 580-56(d) against the interest advanced in each case in support
 of further proceedings. In Kremkow, for example, "we concluded
 that, when balancing the competing interests of the finality of
 
30
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
judgments against a party's desire for relief from someone's
 
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect in
 obtaining the judgment or decree, HRS § 580-56(d) opts for
 finality." Kano, 8 Haw. App. at 179, 799 P.2d at 58. In Kano,
 
on the other hand, "[w]e conclude[d] that, when balancing the
 competing interests of the finality of judgments and decrees
 against a nonmoving party's fraud, misrepresentation, or other
 misconduct in obtaining the judgment or decree, HRS § 580-56(d)
 opts against finality." Id.
 
In another timely post-decree property division case, 
Magoon, the Hawai' i Supreme Court balanced the interest in 
finality that is reflected in HRS § 580-56(d), as applied in Boulton, against the concern that a judgment or final order should manifest the merits of the case in the face of fraud or misrepresentation. The Court observed that: 
Were we to apply Boulton v. Boulton literally, we would have
to affirm the family court. But we would then be ignoring
the fact that the property division was accomplished within
a year, albeit erroneously, and agreeing that the court was
powerless to reconsider its decision in face of allegations
in the substituted plaintiff's motion of fraud,
misrepresentation, or other misconduct of the defendant
because that year had elapsed.
 
. . . .
 
We cannot conclude [that] the legislature intended to
divest our courts of power to do what the proper and orderly
administration of justice demands by adopting the one-year
limitation period in the absence of an express declaration
to that effect.
 
Magoon, 70 Haw. 605, 616, 780 P.2d 80, 86. Similarly, here, were
 
we to apply Boulton literally, the Family Court would have lost
 jurisdiction upon entry of the Decision and would have no
 jurisdiction upon remand. With that in mind, we consider now the
 implications of the Boulton rule in the case of appellate review.
 
1. Final property division orders are appealable
 
HRS § 580-47(b) provides clearly that final property
 
division orders are appealable: "An order as to the custody,
 management, and division of property and as to the payment of
 debts and the attorney's fees, costs and expenses incurred in the
 divorce shall be final and conclusive as to both parties subject
 
31
    
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
only to appeal as in civil cases." H AW. REV. STAT. 580-47(b)
 
(emphasis added). Reading HRS § 580-56(d) to bar the family
 
court from correcting a timely post-decree property distribution
 order on remand from the appellate courts would deny the parties
 the benefit of appellate review to which HRS § 580-47 entitles
 them.
 
It is fundamental in statutory construction "that each
 
part or section of a statute should be construed in connection
 with every other part or section so as to produce a harmonious
 whole." In re Castro, 44 Haw. 455, 458, 355 P.2d 46, 48 (1960). 
Statutes should be interpreted according to the legislature's
 intent and its overall meaning, and "not always according to the
 letter, and every part thereof must be viewed in connection with
 the whole so as to make all parts harmonize, if practicable, and
 give a sensible and intelligent effect to each." Id. (citing
 
Thomas v. Norton, 8 Haw. 67 (Haw. Kingdom 1890)).
 
As a result, the appellate courts have read the one-
year limitation contained in HRS § 580-56(d) narrowly and with an
 appreciation of the role that appellate review plays in the
 process. See, e.g., Todd v. Todd, 9 Haw. App. 214, 220, 832 P.2d
 
280, 283 (1992) (without tolling, "most appeals of the family
 court's decrees finally deciding [division and distribution
 issues] of divorce cases will result in the family court's
 permanent loss of jurisdiction over [division and distribution]
 before the appeal is decided").
19
 
The context of this case is different from that in Todd
 
in that a final property division order has already issued, but
 the consequences of applying the one-year limitation from HRS
 § 580-56(d) would be analogous. In either case, "the family
 court would be powerless to take [any further] action" because
 the notice of appeal was filed after the parties' property was
 fully and finally divided. See Todd, 9 Haw. App. at 220, 832
 
19
 Todd's recognition that the one-year provision in HRS § 580-56(d)
is tolled during the pendency of any appeal has no bearing on the question
that we consider here. Todd addressed a post-decree situation where the
family court had not issued a final property division order, but an appeal was
taken before expiration of the one-year deadline. In the case under
 consideration, a final property division order has already issued, thus
divesting the family court of further jurisdiction over property division.
 
32
   
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
P.2d at 283.
 
"In the absence of an express declaration to the effect
 
that HRS § 580-56(d) was intended to divest the family court of
 
jurisdiction over property division upon remand of a timely
 property division order," Magoon, 70 Haw. at 616, 780 P.2d at 86,
 we observe no reason to so conclude. Appellate review is a
 statutorily recognized exception to the finality of a property-
division decree. H
AW. REV. STAT. § 580-47(b) (2006). For the
 
same reason, we recognize it as an exception to Boulton and the
 general impact of HRS § 580-56(d). Since property-division
 proceedings are equitable in nature, Cassiday v. Cassiday, 68
 Haw. 383, 388, 716 P.2d 1133, 1137 (1986) (citation omitted),
 since appellate review pre-dated the legislature's adoption of
 restrictions on post-decree property distribution under HRS
 § 580-56(d), and since the legislature did not thereafter amend
 HRS § 580-47 to reflect any perceived priority of HRS § 580­56(d), there is no reason for us to conclude that the legislature
 intended HRS § 580-56(d) to eliminate appellate review in the
 case of post-decree property distribution.
 
2. Balancing the interests favors appellate review
 
Determining the scope of HRS § 580-56(d) involves a
 
balancing of competing interests. The purpose of the HRS § 580­56(d) restrictions was to prevent "delay in the resolution of
 property issues outstanding between the parties." Boulton, 69
 
Haw. at 6, 730 P.2d at 340-41. The relatively short time period
 also prevents "protract[ed] litigation." S. Stand. Comm. Rep.
 No. 813, in 1983 Senate Journal, at 1402. Counteracting the need
 for a speedy determination, however, is the right of the parties
 to appeal a property-division order "as in other civil cases." 
H
AW. REV. STAT. § 580-47(b). 
It would appear illogical for the legislature to give
 
the family court up to one year after a divorce to divide the
 parties' property, and give parties the right to appeal that
 decision, only to divest the family court of the ability to
 
33
   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
resolve the issues on remand.20 The fact that the right to
 
appellate review in HRS § 580-47(b) remains unamended in the face
 
of HRS § 580-56(d) reflects, we believe, a legislative
 determination that we are to give effect to both provisions.
 
Analogous to our approach in Greene, we recognize here
 
that the interest in properly deciding the merits of a case that
 underlies appellate review under HRS § 580-47(b) is in partial
 conflict with the interest in speed and finality advanced under
 HRS § 580-56(d). As a result, we agree that in divorce cases on
 remand from the appellate courts where the remand order "relates
 to the division of property, the additional impact of HRS § 580­56(d)'s express legislative policy in favor of the finality of
 judgments and decrees must be considered." See Greene, 8 Haw.
 
App. at 569, 815 P.2d at 32. 
The maximum period of time that HRS § 580-56(d) allows
 
the family court to retain jurisdiction to divide the property is
 one year after a divorce decree that reserves the issue is
 entered. Consistent with the approach in Greene, we conclude
 then that it follows that upon remand and absent extraordinarily
 compelling circumstances, the family court shall retain
 jurisdiction for no more than one year after the date that the
 case is lodged again on remand in order to redivide and
 redistribute the parties' property to the extent required on
 remand. See id.; see also Haw. Fam. Ct. R. 41(e)(2) (relating to
 
dismissal of actions). In light of the importance that the
 Legislature has identified in promptly completing property
 distribution cases, however, the family court should address the
 issues on remand as soon as possible.
 
While we apply the plain meaning of statutes whenever
 
possible, we are bound by law to reject "[e]very construction
 which leads to an absurdity[.]" H
AW. REV. STAT. § 1-15(3) (2009). 
Authorizing the parties to a property-division order to appeal
 those decisions under HRS § 580-47(b), while denying the family
 court the jurisdiction to implement any appellate court
 directives resulting from the same appellate process under HRS §
 
20
 A contrary result could well give parties encouragement to stall
for tactical reasons.
 
34
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
580-56(d), reflects a construction of the latter statute that we
 
are bound by law to reject. Consequently, we conclude that the
 Family Court has jurisdiction to redivide and redistribute the
 parties' property to the extent required on remand subject to the
 one-year post-remand deadline that we adopt above.
 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
For the reasons discussed herein, we vacate Findings
 
12, 18 (to the extent that it pertains to the wasting of assets), 
34, and 35 in the June 18, 2007 Decision. We further vacate
 Adjustment "A" and Distribution "i" in the Order. We affirm in
 all other respects and remand for further proceedings consistent
 with this opinion.
