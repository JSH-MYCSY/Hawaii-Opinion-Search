 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
circuit court entered judgment in favor of Union-Appellee United
 
Public Workers, AFSCME, Local 646, AFL-CIO (UPW) and against the
 City pursuant to the "Order Granting Motion to Confirm Decision
 and Award by Arbitrator Keith Hunter Dated July 26, 2007, Filed
 on August 9, 2007" (Order Granting Motion to Confirm Arbitration)
 filed on September 28, 2007.
 
The Order Granting Motion to Confirm Arbitration
 
provides in relevant part:
 
1. The July 26, 2007 determination by Arbitrator
Keith Hunter on the arbitrability of the class action
grievances filed by [UPW] constitutes a pre-award ruling
rendered in accordance with Section 658A-18, Hawaii Revised
Statutes (HRS). Notice of the award was provided to each
party to the arbitration proceeding on or about July 26,
2007. 
2. As the prevailing party [UPW], on August 9, 2007
filed a motion to confirm the July 26, 2007 "decision and
award" under Sections 658A-22, HRS, and 658A-25, HRS.
 
3. Under Section 658A-18, HRS, the Court shall
issue an expedited order confirming the award unless it
vacates, modifies, or corrects the award under Sections
658A-23 or 658A-24, HRS. Accordingly, the July 26, 2007
pre-award ruling is hereby confirmed.
 
4. Consistent with the foregoing and in accordance
with Section 658A-25(a), HRS, a judgment in favor of [UPW]
shall be entered.
 
On appeal, the City argues that the circuit court erred
 
by confirming the Arbitrator's pre-award ruling on arbitrability
 
when (1) UPW did not ask the arbitrator to incorporate the ruling
 into an award, pursuant to HRS § 658A-19 (Supp. 2009), and (2)
 the 90-day period in which the City could have moved to vacate
 the "award" under HRS § 658A-23 (Supp. 2009) had not run. The
 City asks this court to reverse the Order Granting Motion to
 Confirm Arbitration and the Judgment.
I.
 
This appeal arises from two class action grievances
2
 
filed by UPW, in which UPW alleged that the City had violated
 portions of the parties' collective bargaining agreements. The
 City's Director of Human Resources denied both grievances. UPW
 
2
 UPW's grievances were filed in grievance case numbers CU-06-05 and
CU-06-06, which were consolidated for arbitration by the circuit court on
October 6, 2006.
 
2
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and the City agreed to arbitrate the grievances pursuant to
 
provisions in the parties' collective bargaining agreements. The
 circuit court ordered both grievances to be arbitrated by Keith
 Hunter (the Arbitrator).
 
At some point, the City contested the arbitrability of
 
the grievances, and the Arbitrator held a hearing on the issue. 
The Arbitrator issued "Arbitrator's Determination on the Issue of
 Arbitrability" (the Arbitrator's Determination), in which the
 Arbitrator found and concluded "that the class grievance is
 arbitrable on its merits and this matter shall proceed to further
 arbitration for a determination on the merits of the class
 grievance."
 
On August 9, 2007, UPW filed a "Motion to Confirm
 
Decision and Award by Arbitrator Keith Hunter Dated July 26,
 2007" (Motion to Confirm Arbitration). The circuit court filed
 its Order Granting Motion to Confirm Arbitration and Judgment on
 September 28, 2007. The City timely appealed.
II.
 
A. Appellate Jurisdiction
 
It is axiomatic that we are "under an obligation to ensure
that we have jurisdiction to hear and determine each case
and to dismiss an appeal on our own motion where we conclude
we lack jurisdiction." BDM, Inc. v. Sageco, Inc., 57 Haw.
 
73, 73, 549 P.2d 1147, 1148 (1976). "When we perceive a
jurisdictional defect in an appeal, we must, sua sponte,
 dismiss that appeal." Familian Northwest, Inc. v. Cent.
 
Pac. Boiler & Piping, Ltd., 68 Haw. 368, 369, 714 P.2d 936,
937 (1986).
 
Brooks v. Dana Nance & Co., 113 Hawai 'i 406, 412, 153 P.3d 1091, 
1097 (2007) (brackets omitted) (quoting Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 
648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1129 (1986)).
B. Statutory Interpretation
 
Questions of statutory interpretation are questions of
law to be reviewed de novo under the right/wrong standard.
 
Our statutory construction is guided by the following
well established principles:
 
our foremost obligation is to ascertain and give
effect to the intention of the legislature, which is
to be obtained primarily from the language contained
in the statute itself. And we must read statutory
language in the context of the entire statute and
construe it in a manner consistent with its purpose.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
When there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or
indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an expression used
in a statute, an ambiguity exists.
 
In construing an ambiguous statute, the meaning
of the ambiguous words may be sought by examining the
context, with which the ambiguous words, phrases, and
sentences may be compared, in order to ascertain their
true meaning. Moreover, the courts may resort to
extrinsic aids in determining legislative intent. One
 avenue is the use of legislative history as an
interpretive tool.
 
[The appellate] court may also consider the reason and
spirit of the law, and the cause which induced the
legislature to enact it to discover its true meaning.
 
Lingle v. Hawai 'i Gov't Employees Ass'n, AFSCME, Local 152, AFL­
CIO, 107 Hawai 'i 178, 183, 111 P.3d 587, 592 (2005) (internal 
quotation marks, brackets in original, and ellipses omitted) 
(quoting Guth v. Freeland, 96 Hawai 'i 147, 149-50, 28 P.3d 982, 
984-85 (2001)). 
III.
 
HRS § 658A-28(a) (Supp. 2009) provides:
 
§658A-28 Appeals.  (a) An appeal may be taken from:
 
(1)	 An order denying a motion to compel arbitration; 
(2)	 An order granting a motion to stay arbitration; 
(3) 	An order confirming or denying confirmation of
an award; 
(4)	 An order modifying or correcting an award; 
(5)	 An order vacating an award without directing a
rehearing; or
 
(6)	 A final judgment entered pursuant to this
chapter.
 
(Emphasis added.) An issue in this case is whether the Order
 
Granting Motion to Confirm Arbitration constitutes an "order
 confirming . . . an award" pursuant to HRS § 658A-28(a)(3), i.e.,
 whether the Arbitrator's Determination is an award. This is a
 case of first impression in this jurisdiction.
 
HRS Chapter 685A does not define the phrase 
"arbitration award," and we can find no Hawai
'i case construing 
the phrase. Black's Law Dictionary 147 (8th ed. 2004) defines "award" as "[a] final judgment or decision, esp. one by an arbitrator." In Coldwell Banker Manning Realty, Inc. v. Cushman & Wakefield of Connecticut, Inc., 293 Conn. 582, 980 A.2d 819 
4
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2009), the Supreme Court of Connecticut stated that "[t]he
 
decision rendered by the arbitrator upon the controversy
 submitted for arbitration constitutes the arbitration award. The
 principal characteristic of an arbitration award is its finality
 as to the matters submitted so that the rights and obligations of
 the parties may be definitely fixed." Id. at 594, 980 A.2d at
 
825-26 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Given
 these descriptions, the question becomes whether an arbitrator's
 decision must finally resolve all claims and parties in a case to
 constitute an "award."
 
Although it concerns a motion to vacate an arbitration
 
award, John M. O'Quinn, P.C. v. Wood, 244 S.W.3d 549 (Tex. Ct.
 App. 2007), provides some guidance in deciding the issue in this
 case. There, various clients, as individuals and class members,
 brought an action against the law firm of John M. O'Quinn, P.C.,
 et al. (O'Quinn), alleging that O'Quinn had breached contracts
 with the clients. Id. at 551. O'Quinn filed a motion to compel
 
arbitration, and the trial court entered an order authorizing the
 arbitrator "to determine all class action issues." Id. at 551­
52. The case proceeded to arbitration, and an arbitration panel
 
certified the putative class members as a class, issuing a class
 determination award. Id. at 552. O'Quinn filed in the trial
 
court a motion to vacate the arbitration panel's award. Id. The
 
trial court denied the motion. Id. O'Quinn appealed the trial
 
court's ruling to the Court of Appeals of Texas. Id.
 
The Texas appeals court held that the arbitration
 
panel's award was not appealable:
 
Unless specifically authorized by statute, Texas
appellate courts may review only final orders or judgments.
As a general rule, a final order or judgment is one that
finally disposes of all remaining parties and claims, based
on the record, regardless of its language. This rule
 applies whether the merits of a case will be decided in the
trial court or through arbitration. 
Here, the order denying O'Quinn's motion to vacate
disposed of only a single discrete issue in the case; it did
not finally dispose of all parties and claims. Therefore,
the order is interlocutory. Further, no statutory exception
exists granting O'Quinn a right to appeal this interlocutory
order.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
We note that the Texas General Arbitration Act
 
("TGAA") authorizes the appeal of a judgment or decree
confirming or denying confirmation of an award. However,
when considered in the context of the TGAA and its purpose,
we understand the award referred to by the statute to be the
final arbitration award and not merely any arbitration panel
intermediate decision labeled award. . . . Because the main
 benefits of arbitration lie in the expedited and less
expensive disposition of a dispute, we conclude that it is
unlikely that the Texas Legislature intended for appellate
courts to construe the TGAA as going beyond permitting
appeals from judgments or decrees confirming or denying
final arbitration awards.
 
Id. at 552-53 (internal quotation marks, citations, brackets, and
 
footnote omitted). We agree with the Texas appeals court's
 reasoning in O'Quinn and similarly hold in the instant case that 
the Hawai
'i Legislature likely intended "award" as used in HRS 
§ 658A-28(a) to mean a "final arbitration award and not merely
 any arbitration . . . intermediate decision." O'Quinn, 244
 
S.W.3d at 553. In Hawai
'i, there is a strong state interest in 
encouraging arbitration:
 
It must be observed that "[the Hawai' i Supreme Court]
has long recognized the strong public policy supporting
Hawai'i's arbitration statutes as codified in HRS Chapter
658." Lee v. Heftel, 81 Hawai' i 1, 4, 911 P.2d 721, 724
(1996) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
[The Hawai' i Supreme Court has] stated "that the proclaimed
public policy of our legislature is to encourage arbitration
as a means of settling differences and thereby avoid
litigation." Dorrance v. Lee, 90 Hawai' i 143, 147, 976 P.2d
904, 908 (1999) (internal quotation marks and citations
omitted); see also Gadd v. Kelley  , 66 Haw. 431, 436, 667
P.2d 251, 255 (1983) ("'The proclaimed public policy of our
legislature is to encourage arbitration as a means of
settling differences and thereby avoid litigation.'"
(Quoting Gregg Kendall & Assocs. v. Kauhi, 53 Haw. 88, 93,
488 P.2d 136, 141 (1971)) (other citations omitted)); Mars
 Constructors, Inc. v. Tropical Enters., Ltd., 51 Haw. 332,
334, 460 P.2d 317, 318-19 (1969) ("It is generally
considered that parties resort to arbitration to settle
disputes more expeditiously and inexpensively than by a
court action . . . . Thus, it must be deemed that the
primary purpose of arbitration is to avoid litigation."); In
 re Arbitration Between Carroll & Travis, 81 Hawai' i 264,
267, 915 P.2d 1365, 1368 (App. 1996) ("We recognize that
public policy favors the resolution of disputes by
arbitration.") (Citations omitted.).
 
Kona Village Realty, Inc. v. Sunstone Realty Partners, XIV, LLC,
 
123 Hawai 'i 476, 489, 236 P.3d 456, 469 (2010) (brackets in 
original omitted). In the instant case, prohibiting a party from
 appealing an arbitrator's intermediate decision promotes the
 state's policy of encouraging arbitration.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Although it addresses whether a United States District
 
Court had jurisdiction over the merits of a case, International
 
Shipping Agency, Inc. v. Union Empleados De Muelles De Puerto
 Rico, AFL-CIO, Local 1901, ILA, 547 F. Supp. 2d 116 (D. Puerto
 Rico 2008), provides guidance on this issue as well. At some
 point, the case went to arbitration, id. at 120; the arbitrator
 determined that the underlying claim was arbitrable and would be
 arbitrated on the merits, id.; International Shipping Agency,
 Inc., et al. (International Shipping) opposed the arbitrator's
 determination, id. at 121; and Union Empleados De Muelles De
 Puerto Rico, AFL-CIO, Local 1901, ILA (Union) filed a motion for
 summary judgment and the parties filed related pleadings, id. at
 118. The United States District Court for the District of Puerto
 
Rico (District Court) referred the summary judgment pleadings to
 a magistrate judge, who concluded that the arbitration award did
 not amount to a final judgment because the arbitrator clearly
 retained jurisdiction to hear the merits of the case and
 recommended that the case be dismissed and remanded to the
 arbitrator for further proceedings on the merits. Id. at 118 &
 
120. International Shipping objected to the magistrate judge's
 
recommendation. Id. at 120. 
On appeal, the District Court agreed with the
 
magistrate judge's recommendation and held that the District
 Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain International Shipping's
 complaint. Id. The District Court stated:
 
It is essential for the district court's jurisdiction
that the arbitrator's decision be final, not interlocutory.
 
Generally a district court may review an arbitrator's
rulings . . . only after there is a final award. To be
 
considered final, an arbitration award must be intended by
the arbitrator to be a complete determination of every issue
submitted. Where an arbitrator retains jurisdiction in
order to decide a substantive issue the parties have not yet
resolved, this retention of jurisdiction indicates that the
arbitrator did not intend the award to be final.
 
Id. (internal quotation marks, citations, brackets, and ellipsis
 
in original omitted). Similarly, in the instant case, the
 Arbitrator explicitly retained jurisdiction to decide the merits
 of the case. In the Arbitrator's Determination, the Arbitrator
 stated: "I hereby find and conclude that the class grievance is
 
7
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
arbitrable on its merits and this matter shall proceed to further
 
arbitration for a determination on the merits of the class
 grievance."
 
Given the foregoing, we hold that the Arbitrator's
 
Determination in this case was not an "award" pursuant to HRS
 § 658A-28(a)(3). Consequently, we may not review the instant
 appeal from the Order Granting Motion to Confirm Arbitration
 because the order is unappealable pursuant to HRS § 658A­28(a)(3).
