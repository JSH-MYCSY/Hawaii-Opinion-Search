The circuit court dismissed Okamura's claims against Defendants­
Appellees/Cross-Appellants Sawako Williams (Sawako) and Japan
 
Exterior Technologies (JET) (Calvin, Sawako, and JET are
 
collectively referred to as Defendants) and entered judgment in
 
favor of Sawako and JET and against Okamura.
 
On appeal, Okamura contends the circuit court erred by
 
concluding that 
(1) Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 444-22 (1993) and
 
487-13 (1993) do not allow a plaintiff to recover sums already
 
paid to an unlicensed contractor;
 
(2) Okamura was not entitled to restitution;
 
(3) Okamura was not entitled treble damages under HRS
 
§ 480-13(a)(1) (Supp. 2004) or punitive damages;
 
(4) Defendants did not commit fraudulent concealment;
 
and
 
(5) Sawako was not Calvin's partner in JET and there
 
was no partnership by estoppel.
 
On cross-appeal, Defendants contend the circuit court
 
erred by
 
(1) awarding Okamura $20,000 in attorney's fees and
 
$2,533.69 in costs from Calvin and finding that (a) Okamura was
 the "prevailing party" and (b) Okamura's claims were
 
"inextricably intertwined," and
 
(2) denying Defendants' August 10, 2007 Motion for
 
Attorneys' Fees and Costs.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
Calvin provided contracting services under JET's
 
unregistered trade name. JET imported outdoor gates, awnings,
 
and ornamental fences from Japan. Calvin was not a licensed
 
contractor.
 
Calvin and Okamura's business relationship began in
 
November 2003, when Calvin gave Okamura an estimate for an
 
outdoor canopy. On a JET form titled "Purchase/Work Order,"
 
Calvin wrote his name and phone numbers and the word "Sawako"
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI rI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(his wife's name) in the space marked "selling agent." Okamura
 
did not order the canopy, citing lack of money.
 
In January 2004, Okamura asked Calvin to give her an
 
estimate for repair work, which she used in a construction defect
 
lawsuit against the builder of her home. Okamura told Calvin
 
that the estimate needed to be from a licensed contractor. 
Calvin told Okamura that he was not a licensed contractor, but he
 
then provided a repair estimate on the letterhead of Pham &
 
Associates, the business of licensed contractor David Pham. 
Calvin used the letterhead without Pham's knowledge or consent. 
Okamura did not have any of the work done.
 
In October 2004, Okamura and Calvin signed two
 
contracts for estimated at $60,000. The circuit court found that
 
at the time the contracts were signed, Okamura knew that Calvin
 
was unlicensed, but she wanted to hire an unlicensed contractor
 
because it was cheaper than a licensed contractor.
 
Over the next two months, Calvin and his crew, who were
 
3
almost all unlicensed,  installed, inter alia, a driveway
entrance gate and interphone system, a mail box, custom granite
 
kitchen countertops, custom wood trim on windows and doors, new

 
mirrored wardrobe doors, and flagstone pavers outside the house's
 entry doors. The workers built a closet extension onto the house
 
by cutting into the side of the house, pouring a concrete
 
foundation, and framing the closet.
4
 
Between October and December 2004, Okamura paid Calvin
 
a total of approximately $50,000 by five checks, including one
 
naming Sawako as the payee. The checks were either deposited in
 
a bank account jointly held by Sawako and her mother or cashed by
 
Calvin. In late December 2004, Calvin refused to complete work
 
on the house, and Okamura refused to pay the amount remaining
 
under the contracts.
 
3
 A licensed electrician and plumber performed some of the work.
 
4
 On February 1, 2005, the City and County of Honolulu cited Okamura
and Pham because the closet extension and alterations to the kitchen were done
 
without a building permit.
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI rI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On March 2, 2005, Okamura filed a complaint alleging
 
intentional and/or negligent misrepresentation, fraudulent
 
concealment, unfair or deceptive practices in violation of HRS
 
Chapter 480, bad faith, breach of contract, negligence, and
 
intentional infliction of emotional distress. Okamura prayed for
 
restitution in the amount of $50,000; special, general, treble,
 
and punitive damages; costs of suit; and pre-judgment interest.
 
At trial in January 2007, Okamura testified that the
 
work done did not meet her specifications or was defective. She,
 
however, called no expert to testify as to whether the work
 
completed was defective.
 
Ruling partially in Okamura's favor, the circuit court
 
entered the following conclusions of law:
 
10. Count III (Fraudulent Concealment). As to Count
 
III, [Okamura] failed to prove that the defendant [sic]
intentionally concealed material fact or that there was
intent to defraud [Okamura].
 
11. Count IV (Unfair and Deceptive Practices). Here
 
the defendant [sic] used the letterhead of a licensed
contractor without knowledge or consent of the contractor.
When doing so, the defendant [sic] knew that this was to be
used in litigation between [Okamura] and CTC, and the Court
concludes that this constitutes an unfair and deceptive act
by defendant [sic], in violation of HRS §481A-3(a)(2) and
(3); and §480-2 and §480-13. However, the Court does not
conclude that the contract is void.
 
12. Here [Okamura] has requested restitution, and
for JET to take out some, but not all, of the work it
performed. This is not practical. For example, [Okamura]
is not asking for the closet to be removed and restored, not
asking for the stucco to be removed. Basically [Okamura] is
asking the Court to require an unlicensed contractor without
a building permit to perform work, and the Court will not
countenance such an action.
 
13. Additionally, there is only one case that the
Court could find where restitution was permitted, and that
was under a very different statutory scheme, where it was
specifically provided for in the statute.
 
. . . .
 
15. Count VI (Breach of Contract). [Okamura] failed
to prove the amount of damages for any such breach. She is
 
really claiming poor workmanship, but there was no expert to
describe how the workmanship failed to meet up to standards. 
. . . .
 
18. Count IX (Punitive Damages). [Okamura] did not
prove by clear and convincing evidence a claim that could
justify an award of punitive damages.
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI rI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
19. [Okamura] alleged that [Sawako] is liable as a
partner with [Calvin]. In terms of the argument regarding
partnership, [Sawako] never represented herself as a partner
and she never participated in the business. The fact that
 she had a bank account where business funds were deposited
is really insufficient to prove a partnership. Kienitz v.
 
Peggy Rodgers, 40 Haw. 1 (1953); see also Cooper v. Spencer,
238 S.E. 2d 805 (1977) (Virginia case). There were other
 cases that I found persuasive that the defendants cited in
their closing argument. And there is also no partnership by
estoppel.
 
20. In summary [Okamura] has prevailed on the §480
claim and under §480-13 is awarded $1000 plus attorney's
fees and costs as the prevailing party. [Okamura] has not
prevailed on all the other counts.
 
Following trial, both parties requested attorneys' fees
 
and costs, claiming they were entitled to them as the prevailing
 
party. After hearing the arguments, the circuit court ruled:
 
[H]ere we had an unlicensed contractor using a licensed
contractor's letterhead. You also had the unlicensed
 contractor failing to get a building permit, and so I think
when you look at in essence the totality of the case, the
480 claim, while there were nominal damages, this was a
failure of proof on [Okamura's] part. It was not that the
 unlicensed contractor did everything correctly, it was far
from that, and so when I look at the entire case and when I
look at how the claims were intertwined, I've done a rough
apportionment. I've factored in, in my view, the arguments
that the defense has made and in a sense looked at some
 offset for the defendant's [sic] claimed fees and costs, and
this is I think a fair and appropriate bottom line in terms
of factoring all of those different circumstances in, and so
I'm denying the defendant's [sic] requests for fees and
costs. I'll grant [Okamura's] in a reduced amount of
$20,000 in fees and all the costs.
 
On September 11, 2007, the circuit court entered an
 
"Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part [Okumura's] Motion
 
for Attorney's Fees and Costs, Filed July 18, 2007" and an "Order
 
Denying [Defendants'] Motion for Attorneys' Fees and Costs, Filed
 
August 10, 2007."
 
The circuit court entered the Judgment on September 26,
 
2007 and found that Okamura had prevailed over Calvin on the
 
unfair and deceptive practice claim and awarded her $1,000.00 in
 
damages, $20,000.00 in attorney's fees, and $2,533.69 in costs
 
from Calvin. The circuit court dismissed all of Okamura's claims
 
against Sawako and JET, and entered judgment in favor of Sawako
 
and JET and against Okamura.

II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
A.	 Conclusions of Law (COLs)
 
[The appellate] court reviews the trial court's COLs
de novo. A COL is not binding upon an appellate court and
is freely reviewable for its correctness. Moreover, a COL
that is supported by the trial court's [findings of fact]
and that reflects an application of the correct rule of law
will not be overturned.
 
Bhakta v. County of Maui, 109 Hawai ri 198, 208, 124 P.3d 943, 953 
(2005) (internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets in
 
original omitted).
 
B.	 Attorney's Fees
 
[The appellate] court reviews the denial and granting
of attorney's fees under the abuse of discretion standard.
The same standard applies to [the appellate] court's review
of the amount of a trial court's award of attorney's fees.
An abuse of discretion occurs if the trial court has clearly
exceeded the bounds of reason or has disregarded rules or
principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment
of a party litigant.
 
Chun v. Bd. of Trs. of the Employees' Ret. Sys. of the State of
 
Hawairi, 106 Hawai ri 416, 431, 106 P.3d 339, 354 (2005) (internal 
quotation marks, citations, brackets in original, and ellipses
 omitted) (quoting Chun v. Bd. of Trs. of the Employees' Ret. Sys.
 
of the State of Hawai
ri, 92 Hawai ri 432, 439, 992 P.2d 127, 134 
(2000)).
 
III. DISCUSSION
 
A.	 HRS § 444-22 DOES NOT REQUIRE UNLICENSED
CONTRACTORS, WHO HAVE BEEN PAID PRIOR TO
COMPLETION OF THE JOB, TO DISGORGE PAYMENTS.
 
Okamura contends that a person who contracts with an
 
unlicensed contractor is automatically entitled to recover from
 
that contractor where there is a dispute over the contractor's
 
work.
 
Okamura argues that HRS § 444-22 supports the
 
conclusion that an unlicensed contractor cannot receive payment
 
for work performed. Section 444-22 provides: 
§444-22 Civil action.  The failure of any person to
comply with any provision of this chapter shall prevent such
person from recovering for work done, or materials or
supplies furnished, or both on a contract or on the basis of
the reasonable value thereof, in a civil action, if such
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI rI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
person failed to obtain a license under this chapter prior
to contracting for such work.
 
This court has held that § 444-22 "bars civil actions 
by unlicensed contractors." Jones v. Phillipson, 92 Hawai ri 117, 
125, 987 P.2d 1015, 1023 (App. 1999). See also Shultz v. Lujan, 
86 Hawai ri 137, 140, 948 P.2d 558, 561 (App. 1997) (footnote 
omitted) ("[I]f a person contracts to perform the work of a 
contractor but, at the time of contracting, the person is not 
licensed to do the work, then that person is prohibited from 
bringing civil action to recover payment for work done."). 
Section 444-22 does not provide that a party who uses an 
unlicensed contractor may recover payments already made. 
2.	 Restitution requested by Okamura was an
inappropriate remedy for breach of contract.
 
Okamura contends the circuit court erred in rejecting
 
her request for "restitution." Okamura argued below that the
 
circuit court should order Defendants to remove some of the
 
fixtures that had been installed, restore part of the house to
 
its pre-construction condition, and to return the money paid.5
 
Restitution is required when a person "has been 
unjustly enriched at the expense of another." Durette v. Aloha 
Plastic Recycling, Inc., 105 Hawai ri 490, 502, 100 P.3d 60, 72 
(2004) (quoting Restatement of Restitution § 1 (1937)). As such, 
restitution is an equitable remedy. This court recognizes the 
principle that "equity has always acted only when legal remedies 
were inadequate." Porter v. Hu, 116 Hawai ri 42, 55, 169 P.3d 
994, 1007 (App. 2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Therefore, to maintain a claim for restitution, 
Okamura needed to establish "the absence of an adequate remedy at 
law." Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
An adequate remedy in contract was available in this
 
case because Okamura could bring suit for breach of contract,
 
5
 On appeal, Okamura values "restitution" at $76,000 plus repairs to
the home, although it is unclear how Okamura arrived at that value because the
facts in the record show she paid Defendants approximately $50,000.
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI rI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
notwithstanding the fact that the contract was made with an 
unlicensed contractor. See Jones, 92 Hawai ri at 126, 987 P.2d at 
1024 (footnote omitted) ("HRS § 444-22 does not bar a member of the public, who is a party to such a contract, from bringing suit 
to recover breach of contract damages from an unlicensed 
contractor."). Okamura argues that Jones does not bar "the 
consumer from treating the contract as void and seeking 
restitution." To the contrary, Jones holds that "a contract with 
an unlicensed contractor is not void ab initio." 92 Hawai
ri at 
126, 987 P.2d at 1024 (some emphasis in original and some added). 
Okamura also inappropriately relies on HRS § 480-12
 
(2008 Repl.), which concerns contracts made using unfair and
 deceptive practices. The circuit court did not find that Calvin
 
had engaged in unfair and deceptive practices as to the contracts
 
with Okamura. Accordingly, these contracts are not void under
 
HRS § 480-12. Therefore, the circuit court did not err in
 
refusing restitution.
 
Okamura contends the circuit court erred by finding 
that Defendants proved the value of the work done. This argument 
appears to be based on Okamura's belief that the circuit court 
permitted a "set-off" to Defendants by allowing Defendants to 
retain payments made by Okamura. However, Defendants retain 
Okamura's payments because the circuit court found that Okamura 
failed to meet her burden of proving damages. Even if Okamura 
proved that she was entitled to damages, Defendants would be 
entitled to set-off amounts paid for labor and materials against 
Okamura's recovery, regardless of any violations of HRS Chapters 
444 or 480. See Hiraga v. Baldonado, 96 Hawai
ri 365, 372, 31 
P.3d 222, 229 (App. 2001). Therefore, Okamura's contention regarding the "set-off" is unavailing. 
3.	 The circuit court did not err in awarding nominal
damages, but not punitive or treble damages.
 
Okamura contends the circuit court erred in not
 
awarding treble damages when it found that Calvin had violated
 
8
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI rI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
HRS Chapter 480. HRS § 480-13(b)(1) (Supp. 2004) provides in
 
relevant part:
 
§480-13 Suits by persons injured; amount of recovery,
injunctions.
. . . .
 
(b) Any consumer who is injured by any unfair or
deceptive act or practice forbidden or declared unlawful by
section 480-2:
 
(1)	 May sue for damages sustained by the consumer,
and, if the judgment is for the plaintiff, the
plaintiff shall be awarded a sum not less than
$1,000 or threefold damages by the plaintiff
sustained, whichever sum is the greater, and
reasonable attorneys' fees together with the
costs of suit[.]
 
Because Calvin was found to have violated Chapter 480
 
when he used Pham's letterhead, Okamura was entitled to at least
 
$1,000 in damages. As Okamura did not present proof of damages
 
caused by Calvin, the circuit court awarded her the minimum
 
damages allowed. Okamura fails to show how the circuit court
 
erred in doing so.
 
Okamura contends the circuit court erred in not 
awarding punitive damages. Remedies in an unfair and deceptive 
trade practices claim, the sole claim on which Okamura prevailed, 
are governed by HRS § 480-13, which makes no provision for 
punitive damages. Zanakis-Pico v. Cutter Dodge, Inc., 98 Hawai ri 
309, 319, 47 P.3d 1222, 1232 (2002). Therefore, Okamura was not entitled to punitive damages. 
4.	 The circuit court's finding that there was no
fraudulent concealment was not erroneous where the
 statute requires disclosure from licensed
contractors.
 
Okamura contends the circuit erred in denying her
 
fraudulent concealment claim where Defendants did not provide
 
"written disclosure" as required by HRS § 444-25.5 (Supp. 2010).
6
 
6
 HRS § 444-25.5 provides:
 
§ 444-25.5 Disclosure; contracts.  (a) Prior to entering
into a contract with a homeowner involving home construction or
improvements and prior to the application for a building permit,
(continued...)
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI rI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Section 444-25.5 provides that it applies to "licensed
 
contractors." Because Calvin, Sawako, and JET were not licensed,
 
they do not fall within in the ambit of § 444-25.5. Therefore,
 
Okamura's fraudulent concealment claim fails.
 
5.	 The circuit court did not err in finding that
Sawako was not a partner.
 
Okamura contends the circuit court erred by concluding
 
that Sawako was not a partner in JET.
 
HRS § 425-101 (2004 Repl.) defines a partnership as "an
 
association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a
 
(...continued)
licensed contractors shall:
 
(1)	 Explain verbally in detail to the homeowner all lien
rights of all parties performing under the contract
including the homeowner, the contractor, any
subcontractor or any materialman supplying commodities
or labor on the project;
 
(2)	 Explain verbally in detail the homeowner's option to
demand bonding on the project, how the bond would
protect the homeowner and the approximate expense of
the bond; and
 
(3)	 Disclose all information pertaining to the contract
and its performance and any other relevant information
that the board may require by rule.
 
(b) All licensed contractors performing home construction
or improvements shall provide a written contract to the homeowner.
The written contract shall:
 
(1)	 Contain the information provided in subsection (a) and
any other relevant information that the board may
require by rule;
 
(2)	 Contain notice of the contractor's right to resolve
alleged construction defects prior to commencing any
litigation in accordance with section 672E-11;
 
(3)	 Be signed by the contractor and the homeowner; and
 
(4)	 Be executed prior to the performance of any home
construction or improvement.
 
(c) For the purpose of this section, "homeowner" means the
owner or lessee of residential real property, including owners or

lessees of condominium or cooperative units.
 
(d) Any violation of this section shall be deemed an
unfair or deceptive practice and shall be subject to provisions of
chapter 480, as well as the provisions of this chapter.

business for profit." An "essential element" of a partnership is
 
"an agreement to share profits." Winkelbach v. Honolulu
 
Amusement Co., 20 Haw. 498, 503 (Haw. Terr. 1911); see also
 Buffandeau v. Shin, 60 Haw. 280, 281, 587 P.2d 1236, 1237 (1978). 
Such an agreement "may be express or implied, and may be proven
 
by direct evidence, or by proof of facts and circumstances from
 
which the agreement of the parties may be ascertained." Shinn v.
 
Edwin Yee, Ltd., 57 Haw. 215, 218, 553 P.2d 733, 737 (1976). See
 
also HRS § 425-103 (2004 Repl.). Whether a partnership exists is
 
a question of fact for determination by the trier of fact,
 
reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard. In re Tax Appeal
 
of O.W. Ltd. P'ship, 4 Haw. App. 487, 494, 668 P.2d 56, 62
 (1983). 
Okamura relies on JET's billing practices as evidence 
of an implied agreement to share profits. Evidence presented at 
trial showed that payments by customers to JET were deposited 
into a bank account jointly held by Sawako and her mother; 
Sawako, upon Calvin's request, wired money to Sawako's father in 
Japan; and Sawako's father would use the money to purchase 
products for export to Hawai
ri. Sawako testified that money for 
family expenses were also paid from the bank account she shares with her mother. Based on this evidence, we cannot conclude the 
circuit court erred in holding that "[t]he fact that [Sawako] had 
a bank account where business funds were deposited is really 
insufficient to prove a partnership." 
Okamura also contends Sawako should be estopped from
 
denying the existence of a partnership based on representations
 
made to Okamura. HRS § 425-119 (2004 Repl.) allows the court to
 
recognize a partnership where a person who "by word or conduct,
 
purports to be a partner, or consents to being represented by
 
another as a partner." Okamura relies on several representations
 
as the bases for her estoppel claim: (1) Calvin's estimate set
 
forth both his and Sawako's name and phone number, (2) Okamura's
 
testimony that Calvin introduced Sawako as "my partner" at a
 
dinner meeting with Okamura, and (3) the fact that Okamura wrote
 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI rI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
a check to Sawako as partial payment on the contract. There was
 
no evidence that Sawako herself purported to be a partner or gave
 
her consent to be held out as Calvin's partner. Okamura does not
 
dispute the circuit court's finding that Sawako herself never
 
purported to be Calvin's business partner. Accordingly, the
 
circuit court did not err in refusing to apply partnership by
 
estoppel against Sawako.
 
B.	 CROSS-APPEAL.
 
On cross-appeal, Defendants object to the award of
 
attorney's fees to Okamura and denial of attorneys' fees to
 
Sawako.
 
Generally, each party to litigation pays its own 
expenses except in instances where a statute, stipulation, or 
agreement provides that the prevailing party may shift the fees 
to his or her opponent. Taomae v. Lingle, 110 Hawai ri 327, 331, 
132 P.3d 1238, 1242 (2006). 
1.	 The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in
 
awarding attorney's fees to Okamura.
 
HRS § 480-13 provides the basis for shifting fees and
 
costs to consumers who succeed on an action alleging unfair and
 
deceptive practices. The circuit court found for Okamura on her
 
HRS Chapter 480 claim and awarded her nominal damages and
 
attorney's fees and costs as the prevailing party.
 
Defendants object to the amount awarded Okamura on the 
ground that the documentation submitted by Okamura's attorney 
showed "block billing," which did not allow the circuit court to 
apportion the fees between covered and uncovered claims. 
Alternatively, Defendants argue that the circuit court erred in 
finding that the Chapter 480 claim "intertwined" with the claims 
for which Okamura was not a prevailing party. In apportioning 
attorneys' fees between successful and unsuccessful claims, the 
trial court must determine whether the claims "involve[d] a 
common core of facts or [were] based on related legal theories." 
See Schefke v. Reliable Collection Agency, Ltd., 96 Hawai ri 408, 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI rI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
445, 32 P.3d 52, 89 (2001) (quoting Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461
 
U.S. 424, 435, 103 S. Ct. 1933, 1940 (1983)). The record shows 
that the circuit court determined the claims were intertwined, 
reviewed the billing submitted by Okamura's attorney, made a 
"rough apportionment" of fees, and ultimately reduced the 
attorneys' fees from the $54,000 requested to $20,000. Because 
the circuit court apportioned the fees between Okamura's 
successful and unsuccessful claims and reasonably explained its 
basis for the fee award, we do not conclude that the circuit 
court abused its discretion. Cf. Price v. AIG Hawai ri Ins. Co., 
107 Hawai ri 106, 113, 111 P.3d 1, 8 (2005) (remanding where lower 
court, where apportionment was required, did not explain its fee 
award); Hensley, 461 U.S. at 437, 103 S. Ct. at 1941. 
2.	 The circuit court abused its discretion in denying
fees to Sawako.
 
The circuit court found that Sawako was a prevailing 
party, but denied her any attorney's fees. This is 
irreconcilable with the provision in HRS § 607-14 (Supp. 2010), 
which requires that in assumpsit actions, the attorney's fees of 
the prevailing party be paid by the losing party. The action 
below was in the nature of assumpsit because Okamura's Complaint 
alleged breach of contract and requested contractual damages and 
quasi-contractual relief. See Blair v. Ing, 96 Hawai ri 327, 332, 
31 P.3d 184, 189 (2001). Therefore, attorney's fees should have been awarded to Sawako. 
Given that Sawako and Calvin shared an attorney,
 
Sawako's fees should, to the extent possible, be apportioned from
 
the fees attributable to Calvin's defense. The circuit court
 
should do this on remand. 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
The "Order Denying Defendants Calvin Williams, Jr.,
 
Sawako Williams, and Japan Exterior Technologies' Motion for
 
Attorneys' Fees and Costs, Filed August 10, 2007" filed on
 
September 11, 2007 is vacated insofar as the order denies
