b. Page 4, in line 24 from the top of the page.
c. Page 4, in line 27 from the top of the page.      NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

e. Page 5, in line 16 from the top of the page.
f. Page 5, in line 21 from the top of the page.
g. Page 7, line 6 from the top of the page (2
instances in that line).
2. On page 7, at the end of line 5 and the beginning
of line 6 from the top of the page, the text "the Good Shepard
Church" should be replaced with "The Good Shepherd Pentecostal
Holiness Church" so that as corrected, the text reads as follows: 
". . . Adrian Yuen became the Senior Pastor of The Good Shepherd
Pentecostal Holiness Church."  (Note that the misspelling of
"Shepard" is also corrected to read "Shepherd" pursuant to the
above paragraph 1.g.).
The clerk of the court is directed to incorporate the
foregoing changes in the original opinion and take all necessary
steps to notify the publishing agencies of these changes.
