SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley, and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Redemption Bible College (RBC)
 
appeals from the October 11, 2007, "Judgment for Possession as to
 
349/355 N. Kainalu, Kailua" (Judgment for Possession) filed in
 the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court)
1/ in favor
 
of Defendant-Appellee The International Pentecostal Holiness
 Church (IPHC).  The circuit court issued the Judgment for
 
Possession pursuant to its concurrently filed "Order Granting
 
1/ The Honorable Judge Victoria S. Marks presided.
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
[IPHC's] Motion for Partial Summary Judgment Filed August 13, 
2007" (Partial Summary Judgment Order) and certified the Judgment for Possession pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP) Rule 54(b) (2000). 
This case involves a dispute over whether RBC would be
 
permitted to continue operating a school on property held in the
 name of IPHC. RBC contends that oral assurances given in 1978 by
 an IPHC official to Adrian Yuen, who became and at all times
 relevant to this case was the President of RBC, that a school
 could be operated on IPHC's property for as long as the school
 desired, constituted a lease that entitled RBC to maintain its
 school on the property. IPHC contends that the oral assurances
 given in 1978 constituted a license to use the property that was
 terminated through notice of termination provided in February
 2007. 
On May 8, 2007, RBC and Plaintiffs His Highest Praise 
Pentecostal Holiness Churches, Inc., a dissolved Hawai
'i non­
profit corporation, and Phillip Ellsworth, Pamala Yuen, and Christoper Yuen, in their capacities as Trustees, (collectively, Plaintiffs) filed a complaint against IPHC and Roland W. Carpenter, Sr., (collectively, Defendants) for fraud and misrepresentation, damages to RBC, injunctive relief, a declaratory judgment, and punitive damages. The complaint involved two parcels of property, one located at 349/355 N. Kainalu Drive (349/355 Property) and the other located at 361 N. Kainalu Drive (361 Property). Defendants answered the complaint 
and IPHC asserted a counterclaim against Plaintiffs for 
ejectment, declaratory relief, breach of fiduciary duties, and trespass to realty. 
On August 13, 2007, IPHC moved for partial summary
 
judgment, seeking an order granting summary judgment on its
 ejectment counterclaim for possession in favor of IPHC and
 against RBC as to the 349/355 Property (Partial Summary Judgment
 Motion). On October 11, 2007, the circuit court issued its 
Partial Summary Judgment Order. The circuit court determined
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that "[t]he unwritten understanding between IPHC and RBC, which
 
had permitted RBC to occupy [the 349/355 Property], was a license
 and not a lease." The circuit court granted IPHC's Motion for
 Partial Summary Judgment as to all claims related to the 349/355
 Property, and it ruled that IPHC was entitled to recover
 possession of, and to a writ of possession for, the 349/355
 Property effective as of January 1, 2008. The circuit court
 stated that its Partial Summary Judgment Order resolved the
 second claim in RBC's complaint, which sought damages for IPHC's
 interference with RBC's enjoyment under its alleged "oral lease"
 for the 349/355 Property and damage to RBC's business, and Count
 II of IPHC's counterclaim, which sought a declaration that there
 is no valid lease between IPHC and RBC. The circuit court ruled
 that "[t]he other claims and counterclaims, to the extent not
 inconsistent with this order, remain pending."
 
I. 
On appeal, RBC asserts that the circuit court erred in
 
granting IPHC's Partial Summary Judgment Motion and in issuing
 its Judgment for Possession as to the 349/355 Property. RBC
 argues that: 
1. The verbal agreement between IPHC and RBC
2/ was
 
enforceable despite the Statute of Frauds, Hawaii Revised
 Statutes (HRS) § 656-1 (1993), because a) the agreement could
 have been performed within one year; b) the agreement was partly
 performed; and c) equitable estoppel applied.
 
2. The failure to record the oral "lease" on the
 
transfer certificates of title for the 349/355 Property did not
 violate HRS § 501-121 (2006) because the "lease" could have
 terminated in less than one year.
 
3. The verbal agreement between IPHC and RBC was a
 
lease, not a license.
 
2/ In its opening brief, RBC refers to the "verbal agreement between
IPHC and The Good Shepard School, now known as [RBC] dba Redemption Academy." 
3
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
4. IPHC could not unilaterally terminate the
 
agreement between IPHC and RBC.
 
5. There were genuine issues of material fact that
 
precluded summary judgment.
 
6. IPHC was not entitled to a Judgment of Possession.
 
We conclude that the dispositive issue in this appeal
 
is whether the oral understanding between IPHC and RBC3/ was a
 
license or a lease. Because we agree with the circuit court that
 
the oral understanding was a license and not a lease, we affirm
 the Judgment for Possession and the Partial Summary Judgment
 Order. 
II.
 
When viewed in the light most favorable to RBC, the
 
pertinent facts are as follows.
 
IPHC acquired title to the 349/355 Property in 1968. 
In 1977, Leon Stewart (Stewart), who was then the Director of
 Evangelism and Assistant Superintendent of IPHC, recruited Adrian
 Yuen to be a pastor for The Good Shepherd Pentecostal Holiness
 Church and to establish and operate a Christian school on IPHC's
 property. 
At that time, IPHC had title to the 349/355 Property
 
and had agreed to purchase the 361 Property by way of an
 agreement of sale. However, the 361 Property was being leased to
 
Hawaii Care Center. Thus, in 1978, when Adrian Yuen became the
 
Senior Pastor for The Good Shepard Pentecostal Holiness Church,
 only the 349/355 Property was available for the proposed school. 
The interim pastor, James Valentin (Valentin), informed
 
Adrian Yuen that The Good Shepard Pentecostal Holiness Church did
 not have money to fund the school and that Adrian Yuen would have
 to find funding elsewhere. Valentin and Stewart assured Adrian
 Yuen that the school could remain on the 349/355 Property for as
 long as the school wanted to be there. Adrian Yuen began
 
3/ As discussed infra, the oral understanding was between Leon Stewart,
a representative of IPHC, and Adrian Yuen, who later became the President of
RBC. For purposes of simplicity, we will at times refer to the oral
understanding as being between IPHC and RBC.

developing plans for a school, and he discussed his plans with A.
 
Joel Criz (Criz), a realtor and member of The Good Shepard
 Pentecostal Holiness Church, who expressed interest in providing
 funds for construction of the school. 
Stewart assured Adrian Yuen and Criz that the school
 
would be permitted to operate on the 349/355 Property and on the
 361 Property, when the 361 Property became available, until the
 school chose to cease using the premises. In return, Criz
 donated funds and oversaw the construction of a school on the
 349/355 Property at a cost of over $200,000. The school, which
 was named The Good Shepherd School, began operations in 1978. 
Before the school was built, there was already a church sanctuary
 building, a church office, and a parsonage on the 349/355
 Property. The school did not have exclusive use of the 349/355
 Property, but shared the property with the IPHC's The Good
 Shepard Pentecostal Holiness Church, which used the sanctuary for
 Sunday service. 
In 1983, the school changed its name to Redemption
 
Academy, and Adrian Yuen established RBC to operate the school. 
Prior to the lawsuit underlying this case, RBC and The Good
 Shepard School did not pay any rent to IPHC for the use of the
 349/355 Property. In about July 2005, Adrian Yuen withdrew from
 
the IPHC denomination. Thereafter, IPHC and RBC attempted to
 
negotiate a written lease, but were unable to reach an agreement.
 Effective February 28, 2007, IPHC terminated its oral agreement
 with RBC. 
The 349/355 Property is covered by two Land Court
 
Certificates of Title. Both certificates show title in IPHC and
 no interest in RBC.

"We review the circuit court's grant or denial of
 
summary judgment de novo." Querubin v. Thronas, 107 Hawai'i 48,

Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there
is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. A
 fact is material if proof of that fact would have the effect
of establishing or refuting one of the essential elements of
a cause of action or defense asserted by the parties. The
 evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the
non-moving party. In other words, we must view all of the
evidence and the inferences drawn therefrom in the light
most favorable to the party opposing the motion.

RBC argues that the circuit court erred in concluding
 
that the oral understanding between IPHC and RBC was merely a
 
license, and not a lease. We disagree.
 
In Kiehm v. Adams, 109 Hawai 'i 296, 126 P.3d 339 
(2005), the Hawai 'i Supreme Court identified three key factors 
for determining whether an agreement is a license or a lease: 
(1) Most importantly, does the grantee have the right
to occupy a distinct and separate part of the premises
(i.e., a definite parcel)? Bush [v. Watson], 81 Hawai' i 
[474,] 486, 918 P.2d [1130,] 1142 [(1996)] (citing 49
Am.Jur.2d Landlord and Tenant § 1161); Kapiolani [ParkPreservation Society v. City and County of Honolulu], 69Haw. [569,] 579, 751 P.2d [1022,] 1029 [(1988)]; see also 49Am.Jur.2d Landlord and Tenant § 21 ("Exclusive possession ofthe leased premises is essential to the character of a lease. . . . There must be a conveyance of a definite space inorder for a lease, rather, than a license, to exist; boththe extension and the location of the space within thelessor's premises must be specified."); Harkins v. WinCorp., 771 A.2d 1025, 1027 (D.C. 2001) (essentialdistinction between roomers and tenants is whether the occupant has exclusive possession or control of thepremises); 
(2) Is the grantee's right to possession assignable
(suggesting a lease) or is it a personal privilege
(suggesting a license)? Kapiolani, 69 Haw. at 579, 751 P.2d
at 1029; see also 49 Am.Jur.2d § 21 (same); and
 
(3) Is the agreement for a fixed term (suggesting a
lease)? Kapiolani, 69 Haw. at 579, 751 P.2d at 1029; see
also McCandless v. John Ii Estate, 11 Haw. 777, 788-89
(1899) (same); 49 Am.Jur.2d § 21 (same).
 
Id. at 303, 126 P.3d at 346.
 
Applying these factors, we conclude that under the
 
circumstances of this case, the oral understanding between IPHC
 
and RBC, as a matter of law, was a license and not a lease.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
First, the record shows that RBC did not have exclusive
 
possession of the 349/355 Property. Adrian Yuen admitted in his
 
declaration that the church sanctuary building, the church
 office, and a parsonage were already on the 349/355 Property in
 1978, when Adrian Yuen became the Senior Pastor of the Good
 Shepard Church. He further acknowledged that The Good Shepard
 Pentecostal Holiness Church used the sanctuary on the 349/355
 Property for Sunday service. Thus, the first factor supports the
 conclusion that RBC only had a license to use the 349/355
 Property. 
[A] licensor does not cede exclusive possession or transfer
her interest, but instead shares possession. See American
 Jewish Theater v. Roundabout Theatre Co., Inc., 203 A.D.2d
155, 610 N.Y.S.2d 256, 257 (1st Dept.1994) ("The nature of
the transfer of absolute control and possession is what
differentiates a lease from a license or any other
arrangement dealing with property rights."); Roberts v. Lynn
Ice Co., 187 Mass. 402, 73 N.E. 523, 524 (1905) (question of
whether an agreement concerning use of real property is a
lease or a license depends on whether the agreement cedes
exclusive possession from one party to the other). See
 generally 49 Am.Jur.2d § 21 (discussing distinction between
lease and license).
 
Id. at 303 n.18, 126 P.3d at 346 n.18. 
Second, RBC has no basis to claim that it had a right
 
to possession of the 349/355 Property that was assignable. There
 
was no written agreement and thus no written assignment clause. 
In addition, RBC does not allege that any oral assurances Adrian
 Yuen received from Stewart regarding the use of the 349/355
 Property included a promise that Adrian Yuen could assign any
 right regarding the use of the property to another. Contrary to
 RBC's claim, the fact that IPHC allowed RBC to continue to
 operate the school on the 349/355 Property after the school
 changed its name and RBC was incorporated does not show that the
 oral understanding created a right to possession that was
 assignable. Instead, IPHC's allowing RBC to continue operating
 the school on the 349/355 Property is fully consistent with the
 conclusion that the original oral understanding established a
 permissive license to use the property that IPHC chose to extend
 to RBC. 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Third, RBC concedes that no fixed term was established
 
in the oral understanding. See Francone v. McClay, 41 Haw. 72,
 
78 (1955) (describing the essential elements for an enforceable
 
lease as "definite agreement as to the name of the parties to the
 lease, the extent and bounds of the property leased, a definite
 and agreed term, a definite and agreed price or rental, and the
 time and manner of payment").
 
The 1978 oral understanding between Stewart and Adrian 
Yuen only created a license to use the 349/355 Property. This license was subject to termination or revocation by IPHC. See 
Kiehm, 109 Hawai
'i at 304, 126 P.3d at 347. There is no dispute 
that in February of 2007, IPHC gave RBC written notice that RBC's authorization to use the 349/355 Property was terminated. IPHC thus terminated RBC's license to use the 349/355 Property. We conclude that the circuit court was correct in granting IPHC's Partial Summary Judgment Motion as to all claims related to the 349/355 Property and in issuing the Judgment for Possession. 
C.
 
Our determination that RBC only had a license to use
 
the 349/355 Property that was terminated by IPHC renders it
 unnecessary for us to address the remaining arguments raised by
 RBC in this appeal. 
IV.
 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the circuit
 
court's Judgment for Possession and its Partial Summary Judgment
 Order, which were both filed on October 11, 2007.
