FOLEY, PRESIDING JUDGE, FUJISE AND LEONARD, JJ.
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY LEONARD, J.
    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Respondent/Cross-Appellant State of Hawai' i (State) 
1
cross-appeals  from the February 1, 2006 Order No. 22254 (Order 
No. 22254) and the October 16, 2007 Decision and Order No. 23725 
(Order No. 23725) entered by Petitioner/Cross-Appellee Public Utilities Commission of the State of Hawai' i (the Commission or 
PUC) in an administrative proceeding.
2 
In Order No. 22254, the Commission initiated an 
investigation to determine whether Act 59 of the 1974 Session 
Laws of Hawaii (Act 59) "invalidates, voids, or renders 
unenforceable," a 1961 agreement entered into by and between the 
Estate of Bernice P. Bishop, deceased (Bishop Estate), Kaiser 
Hawaii Kai Development Co. (Kaiser), and the City and County of Honolulu (City), whereby Kaiser agreed to provide certain 
sewerage services, including service to area schools and parks, 
to the City at no charge (1961 Agreement). Respondent/Cross-
Appellee Hawaii-American Water Company (HAWC) is Kaiser's 
successor-in-interest and the current owner and operator of the 
subject sewerage system (Sewerage System). In 1965, the State 
assumed responsibility for all public schools in Hawai' i. 
Therefore, the State is the City's successor-in-interest with 
respect to the four schools served by the Sewerage System. 
As discussed in this Opinion, in Order No. 23725, the
 
Commission determined that the "rates" established by the 1961
 
Agreement are unenforceable and unlawful to the extent that they
 
conflict with HAWC's tariff filed with and approved by the
 
Commission and that all of HAWC's customers must pay the tariff
 
1/
 The City & County of Honolulu filed a notice of appeal, prior to
the State's filing of the cross-appeal. However, the City's appeal was later
dismissed with prejudice, pursuant to a stipulation of the parties.
 
2/
 As to Order No. 22254, the Commission was comprised of Chairman
Carlito P. Caliboso, Commissioner Janet E. Kawelo, and Commissioner Wayne H.
Kimura, who was excused. As to Order No. 23725, the Commission was comprised
of Chairman Carlito P. Caliboso, Commissioner Leslie H. Kondo, and
Commissioner John E. Cole, who was excused.

rates approved by the PUC. In this appeal, the State challenges
 
the Commission's decision on various grounds. We affirm.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
A. General Background
 
The Commission is an agency statutorily authorized to
 
supervise and regulate public utilities, including, inter alia,
 
the authority to investigate public utility companies and to
 
approve increases to public utility rates. See Hawaii Revised
 
Statutes (HRS) §§ 269-6, 269-15, 269-16 (2007). HAWC is a
 
regulated entity that provides its sewerage services to numerous
 
customers, including the State.
 
In the early 1960s, Kaiser developed certain real 
property which was owned by Bishop Estate and located on the 
eastern side of Oahu in the area now generally known as Hawai' i 
Kai. The 1961 Agreement was executed in connection with this 
development. 
At the time of the 1961 Agreement, private sewer 
companies were not considered "public utilities" subject to 
Commission regulation as defined under (former) Revised Laws of 
Hawai'i §§ 104-1 (Supp. 1961), 104-5 (1955). In 1974, in Act 59, 
the Legislature expanded the definition of "public utility" to include private sewer companies. See 1974 Haw. Sess. L. Act 59, 
§ 2 at 110. The relevant statutory text, which has remained materially unaltered since 1974, now provides: 
§ 269-6. General powers and duties. (a) The
 
public utilities commission shall have the general
supervision hereinafter set forth over all public
utilities, and shall perform the duties and exercise
the powers imposed or conferred upon it by this
chapter.
 
.  .  . .
 
§ 269-1. Definitions. 
. . . .
 
3  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
"Public utility":
 
(1) 	Includes every person who may own, control,
operate, or manage . . . any plant or equipment
. . . for public use, for . . . the disposal of
sewage; provided that the term shall include: 
(A) 	Any person insofar as that person owns or
operates a private sewer company or sewer
facility. . . .
 
Accordingly, Act 59 subjects HAWC to Commission
 
regulation. 
From 1961 to 2004, HAWC or one of its predecessors 
provided the City or the State with free sewerage service to four 
schools in Hawai' i Kai. 
B.	 Procedural History
 1.	 Docket 03-0025 and the 2004 Tariff
 
In 2003, HAWC initiated a rate increase application
 
with the Commission in Docket No. 03-0025. HAWC and the Consumer
 
Advocate were the only parties.
3
 
In the course of the proceeding, the Consumer Advocate
 
recommended that the Commission, in calculating HAWC's
 
prospective sewerage rates, impute revenue to HAWC in an amount
 
equal to the compensatory value of the free sewerage services
 
provided to the State and City under the 1961 Agreement (the
 
Facilities Credit). The Consumer Advocate's testimony included:
 
3/
 Pursuant to HRS § 269-51 (2007) and Hawaii Administrative Rules
(HAR) § 6-61-62 (1992), the Consumer Advocate represents the consumer and may
participate as an ex officio party in Commission proceedings. See, e.g., In
re Hawaiian Elec. Co., Inc., 5 Haw. App. 445, 446 n.1, 698 P.2d 304, 306 n.1
(1985). Those sections respectively provide, in relevant part, that:
 
§ 269-51. Consumer advocate; director of commerce and
consumer affairs. The director of commerce and consumer
 
affairs shall be the consumer advocate in hearings before
the public utilities commission. The consumer advocate
 shall represent, protect, and advance the interests of all
consumers, including small businesses, of utility services.
 
§ 6-61-62. Consumer advocate. (a) The consumer
 
advocate is, ex officio, a party to any proceeding before
the commission. . . . 
4 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Furthermore, the [1961 Agreement] required the sewer
company to serve "[a]ll City facilities, meaning but not
limited to schools and parks, hereafter established within
the area...shall be served by the sewerage system at no
expense to the City."
 
In order to ensure that taxpayers do not bear
higher costs as a result of the [1961 Agreement]
requiring these facilities to be served for a non-
compensatory fee, the Commission has allowed in
previous rate cases, the inclusion of a facilities
credit in the calculation of [HAWC's] revenue
requirement. This facilities credit reduces the
 additional revenue requirement with revenues that
would have been received if these facilities had been
 charged compensatory rates for the service provided.
Therefore, the imputed revenues for this docket will
differ from the actual revenues that will be collected
 based on the [1961 Agreement], which is based on a
proportion of operating costs.
 
. . . .
 
The estimated wastewater for these facilities is
 
27,456 thousand gallons. Multiplied by the $6.22 non-
restaurant rate per thousand gallons results in an imputed
revenue of $170,776 for the facilities credit.
 
In a stipulated settlement agreement with the Consumer
 
Advocate (Settlement Agreement), HAWC ultimately agreed to the
 
proposed Facilities Credit while expressing its intent to seek,
 
in a separate proceeding, actual compensation for the services
 
rendered to the City and the State.
 
In May of 2004, the Commission approved HAWC's rate 
increase application. Shortly thereafter, HAWC filed a tariff 
with the Commission, effective May 6, 2004, which reflected the 
newly-approved sewerage rates (the 2004 Tariff). Generally 
stated, tariffs are "public documents setting forth services 
being offered; rates and charges with respect to services; and 
governing rules, regulations, and practices relating to those 
services." In re Waikoloa Sanitary Sewer Co., Inc., 109 Hawai' i 
263, 271, 125 P.3d 484, 492 (2005) (internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets omitted).

The State is not challenging the Commission's
 
underlying rate calculations or the approval of the 2004 Tariff. 
2. The Circuit Court Proceedings
 
In 2004, HAWC filed two actions in the Circuit Court of
 
the First Circuit (Circuit Court): (1) Civil No. 04-1-2138-11,
 
initiated against defendants Hawaii Kai Dunhill IDG Limited
 
Partnership and Dunhill Hawaii Management LLC (together, the
 
Shopping Center) for damages arising from alleged unpaid sewerage
 fees (the Shopping Center Litigation); and (2) Civil No. 04-1­
2243-12 and Civil No. 04-1-2244-12, respectively initiated
 
against the State and City for declaratory relief and damages
 
arising from alleged unpaid sewerage fees (together, the State
 
and City Litigation). 
In the Shopping Center Litigation, HAWC sought unpaid
 
sewerage fees from the Shopping Center for services rendered
 
under both a 1991 tariff and the 2004 Tariff. On August 4, 2005,
 
the Circuit Court granted HAWC's motion for summary judgment as
 
to liability, but postponed its adjudication of damages. The
 
Shopping Center argued that the damages awarded to HAWC should be
 
offset by a "landscaping credit" included in the 2004 Tariff, but
 
excluded in the 1991 tariff. 
On October 12, 2005, the Circuit Court invited the
 
Commission to submit an amicus curiae brief regarding the
 
Shopping Center's claimed entitlement to the landscaping credit
 
for sewerage services rendered prior to the 2004 Tariff. On
 
January 20, 2006, the Commission filed an amicus curiae brief
 
(Amicus Brief) which concluded that "[a]llowing the recovery of
 
offsets for landscaping credits prior to [the 2004 Tariff] would
 
effectively modify the terms of the [1991 tariff]," and
 
accordingly, was precluded under the filed-rate doctrine. 
The State and City Litigation, which turns on the
 
enforceability of the 1961 Agreement, was stayed in 2005, by
 
stipulation, pending the Commission proceedings discussed below.

3. The Commission Proceedings
 
a. Docket 05-0140
 
On June 7, 2005, HAWC filed a petition in PUC Docket
 
No. 05-0140 seeking a declaratory order from the Commission that: 
(1) the rates set forth in the 1961 Agreement were unenforceable
 
in light of the duly-approved 2004 Tariff; and (2) the State and
 
City were obligated to pay past arrears and future sewerage fees
 
in conformity with the 2004 Tariff. On June 23, 2005, the
 
Commission entered Order No. 21888 which denied HAWC's petition
 
and closed Docket No. 05-0140, while also expressing the
 
Commission's future intent to evaluate the enforceability of the
 
1961 Agreement in a separate proceeding.
 
b. Docket 2006-0021
 
On February 1, 2006, the Commission entered Order No.
 
22254 which: (1) formally initiated Docket No. 2006-0021 in order
 to determine the enforceability of the 1961 Agreement; (2) named
 
HAWC, the City, and the Consumer Advocate as parties; (3) invited
 
other interested parties to file a motion to intervene; and (4)
 
required all parties, including intervenors, to file a stipulated
 
procedural order to govern the proceedings.
4 Thereafter, the
 
4/
 The Commission initiated Docket No. 2006-0021 pursuant to, inter
 
alia, HRS §§ 269-7, 269-15, and 269-16 (2007). Those statutory sections
respectively provide, in relevant part:
 
§ 269-7. Investigative powers. (a) The public
utilities commission and each commissioner shall have power
to examine into the condition of each public utility...the
fares and rates charged by it...and all its financial
transactions...its compliance with all applicable state and
federal laws...and all matters of every nature affecting the
relations and transactions between it and the public or
persons or corporations.
 
. . . .
 
§ 269-15. Commission may institute proceedings to
enforce chapter.  (a) If the public utilities commission is
of the opinion that any public utility or any person is
violating or neglecting to comply with any provision of this
chapter or of any rule, regulation, order, or other
requirement of the commission...or that any rates, fares,
(continued...)

  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
State intervened.
 
On April 6, 2006, HAWC filed its Position Statement,
 
arguing that "[u]nder HRS Chapter 269 and the filed-rate doctrine
 
. . . HAWC is not only entitled to collect the amounts contained
 
in the [2004 Tariff], but HAWC is actually required to do so, as
 
providing service on different terms or at different rates would
 
be unlawful." HAWC further contended that "the rates, formulas,
 
and [free service provision] contained in the 1961 Agreement are
 
not enforceable and that all of HAWC's customers must pay the
 
rates provided in the [2004 Tariff] filed with the [Commission]." 
On May 1, 2006, the State filed its Position Statement,
 
arguing that: (1) the 2004 Tariff did not specifically reference
 
or abrogate the 1961 Agreement, and to that end, the free service
 
provision should be properly characterized as a fixed cost of
 
HAWC; and (2) the State received inadequate notice of HAWC's
 
intention to challenge the 1961 Agreement. The State further
 
argued, "[i]n regard to the public interest considerations:" (1)
 
if the Commission were to declare the 1961 Agreement
 
4/(...continued)
classifications, charges, or rules are unreasonable or
unreasonably discriminatory, or that in any way it is doing
what it ought not to do, or not doing what it ought to do,
it...may institute such proceedings before it as may be
necessary to require the public utility or the person to
correct any such deficiency. . . .
 
. . . .
 
§ 269-16. Regulation of utility rates; ratemaking
procedures. (a) All rates, fares, charges,
classifications, schedules, rules, and practices made,
charged, or observed by any public utility . . . shall be
just and reasonable and shall be filed with the public
utilities commission. . . .
 
(b) No rate, fare, charge, classification, schedule, rule,
or practice, other than one established pursuant to an
automatic rate adjustment clause previously approved by the
commission, shall be established, abandoned, modified, or
departed from by any public utility, except after thirty
days' notice to the commission as prescribed in section
269-12(b), and prior approval by the commission for any
increases in rates, fares, or charges. . . .

unenforceable, future utility companies would have difficulty
 
obtaining necessary building and use permits; and (2) if the
 
Commission were to declare the 1961 Agreement unenforceable, the
 
City could potentially purchase the Sewerage System for $1.00
 
under the terms of the 1961 Agreement. 
On May 15, 2006, HAWC replied to the State's position,
 
reiterating HAWC's interpretation of the filed-rate doctrine and
 
attaching, amongst other things, the Amicus Brief. 
On October 16, 2007, the Commission entered Order No.
 
23725, concluding that: (1) the rates established under the 1961
 
Agreement were unenforceable to the extent that those rates
 
conflicted with the 2004 Tariff; and (2) all HAWC customers,
 
including the State, must pay the rates embodied in the 2004
 
Tariff.  Order No. 23725 provides, inter alia, a discussion of
 
the factual and legal grounds for the PUC's decision, including
 
the following excerpts (footnotes omitted):
 
State law confers the supervision and regulation of
"all public utilities" and the administration of HRS chapter
269 on the commission. The definition of a "public utility
in HRS § 269-1 was amended in 1974 through Act 59 to include
private owners and operators of sewer facilities. . . .
HAWC provides wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal
services in the Hawaii Kai area and, thus, is a public
utility under the commission's jurisdiction subject to, by
law, the provisions set forth in HRS chapter 269. In
 particular, HRS § 269-16 sets forth the parameters for the
regulation of utility rates and ratemaking. . . .
 
. . . .
 
Upon review, the commission finds the rates of the
1961 Agreement to be unenforceable and unlawful to the
extent that they conflict [with] HAWC's [2004 Tariff]. The provisions of HRS § 269-16 are clear: all rates, fares,charges, classifications, schedules, rules, and practicesmade, charged, or observed by any public utility must befiled with and approved by the commission. HAWC's [2004Tariff] filed with and approved by the commission does notmention the provisions of the 1961 Agreement. Additionally,as explained by HAWC, under the filed rate doctrine, onceapproved by a regulatory agency, the tariff of a publicutility is considered to be the law with respect to theservice provided and the public utility may not charge ratesthat are different from the tariff. The Hawaii SupremeCourt made clear in Balthazar v. Verizon Hawaii, Inc., 109Hawai'i 69, 77, 123 P.3d 194, 202 (2005) ("Balthazar"), that
the filed rate doctrine is applicable in a case involving a 
9 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
public utility subject to the commission's jurisdiction.
Thus, the 1961 Agreement which provides for free sewer
services to all City facilities in Hawaii Kai and rates
based on a certain formula for the Portlock and Related
 Areas is unenforceable and unlawful.
 
HAWC's argument that the 1961 Agreement was subject to
the exercise of the State's police power to regulate sewer
services through the passage of the 1974 Amendment, and that
the rates set forth in the 1961 Agreement were abrogated
through the application of the filed rate doctrine when the
commission approved tariffs which conflicted with the 1961
Agreement rates is sound, and is based on reliable case
authority. As HAWC maintains, the Hawaii Supreme Court
states in Molokoa Village [Dev. Co., Ltd. v. Kauai Elec. Co.
Ltd., 60 Haw. 582, 593 P.2d 375 (1979),] that "[i]t is well
established that a public utility can enforce payment for
its services in accordance with its established tariff,
notwithstanding any agreement to charge less." Aside from
 relying on Molokoa Village and countless other cases, HAWC
asserts that the matters of this case is similar to that of
 a 1980 New Jersey case wherein the supreme court in that
state "held that even rates set between the utility and city
prior to the statute's enactment are subject to the new
statutory scheme." Akin to this case, among other things,
the agreement in question in Plainfield [v. Public Serv.
Elec. & Gas Co., 82 N.J. 245, 412 A.2d 759 (1980)]: (1) was
entered into between a utility and a municipality; (2)
involved the provision of free utility service for municipal
facilities for use of city property in the provision of
utility service; and (3) was entered into prior to the
enactment of the relevant state statute. Thus, the
commission finds the application of the holding in
Plainfield to the matters of this case to be appropriate. .
 . .
 
In contrast, the arguments presented by the City and
the [State] in their respective position statements are
unpersuasive, erroneous, and inapplicable. . . . 
[The State's] implication that the 1961 Agreement is
an impact fee, and argument that it was provided no notice
of the abrogation of the agreement since there is no
reference of it made in the tariff is immaterial. As HAWC
 correctly states, HAWC is required to charge and collect
sewer fees pursuant to the tariff rates for its customer
classes, and thus the rates of the 1961 Agreement cannot
stand. Similarly, the timing of HAWC's decision to collect
the sewer fees attributable to the facilities of the City
and the [State] is also irrelevant since the 1961 Agreement
became legally unenforceable with the regulation of sewer
companies and the resulting affect of the filed rate
doctrine. Moreover, continuing to apply rates pursuant to
the 1961 Agreement would be a violation of HRS § 269-16.
 
[The State's] claim that a commission determination
that the 1961 Agreement is void or unenforceable would
trigger Section 9 of the agreement and, thus, allow the City
to purchase the Sewerage System for $1.00 appears to be
inaccurate since Section 9 of the [1961 Agreement] would
 
10 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
only be triggered if the owner and operator of the system
intends to abandon its operations and ownership. HAWC
 assures the commission that this is not the case, and
elaborates that it fully intends to continue providing
services to all of its customers.
 
[The State's] contention that HAWC would not have an
independent claim to provide sewer services in the Hawaii
Kai area without the 1961 Agreement is also inaccurate. As
 HAWC correctly states, while the [State's] allegation would
have been proper prior to 1974, due to the change in the law
and the regulation of sewer companies by the commission
through passage of Act 59, the commission, under Chapter
269, HRS, and not the 1961 Agreement authorizes HAWC to
provide sewerage services in the Hawaii Kai area. 
Finally, the [State's] request that the commission
find that the 1961 Agreement is a necessary operating cost
of HAWC; or, in the alternative, should deduct the cost [of]
the 1961 Agreement from whatever profits the commission
allows the utility is not sufficiently supported. Under the
 circumstances, it is questionable whether such a finding by
the commission would be "just and reasonable" and in the
public interest. The [State] in its position statement did
not fully elaborate on why the commission should grant its
request and how grant of its request is just and reasonable
in the public interest. Additionally, the [State] did not
satisfactorily counter HAWC's arguments regarding the
applicability of the filed rate doctrine and HAWC's
obligation under the doctrine and HRS chapter 269 to collect
the rates set forth in its approved tariff.
 
The principles that underlie the filed rate doctrine
are: (1) preventing price discrimination and ensuring all
customers pay the same rates; and (2) preserving the
regulatory agency's exclusive role in approving rates and to
ensure that the filed rates are the exclusive source of the
 terms and conditions by which the utility provide services
to its customers. These principles are well-established and
in the public interest.
 
Based on the foregoing, the commission concludes that
the rates established by the 1961 Agreement are
unenforceable and unlawful to the extent that they conflict
with HAWC's tariff filed with and approved by the
commission. Additionally, the commission further concludes
that all of HAWC's customers must pay rates set forth in
tariffs filed with and approved by the commission.
 
. . . .
 
THE COMMISSION ORDERS:
 
1. The rates established by the 1961 Agreement are
unenforceable and unlawful to the extent that they conflict
with HAWC's [2004 Tariff] filed with and approved by the
commission.
 
2. All of HAWC's customers must pay rates set forth
in the tariffs filed with and approved by the commission.

On November 15, 2007, the City timely filed a notice of
 
appeal from Order No. 23725, and on November 27, 2007, the State
 
timely filed a cross-appeal. The City's appeal was dismissed by
 
stipulation on July 8, 2008.
 
II.	 POINTS OF ERROR
 
The State raises the following points on appeal:
 
(1) The Commission erred in concluding that: (a) the
 
rates established by the 1961 Agreement are unenforceable to the
 extent that they conflict with the 2004 Tariff, and (b) all HAWC
 
customers, including the State, must pay sewerage rates set forth
 
in the 2004 Tariff;
 
(2) The Commission erred in failing to address public
 
interest considerations in Order No. 23725, although, in Order
 
No. 22254, it specifically identified public interest
 
considerations as an issue in its investigation; 
(3) In holding that the filed-rate doctrine
 
invalidated the 1961 Agreement, the Commission erred in failing
 
to apply the heightened standard applicable when the State's
 
exercise of its police powers interferes with its own contractual
 
obligations; and
 
(4) The Commission erred in Order No. 22254 by failing
 
to disclose the Amicus Brief filed in the Shopping Center
 
Litigation.
 
III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
The construction of a tariff is a question of law, 
reviewed on appeal under the right/wrong standard. See In re 
Waikoloa Sanitary Sewer Co., Inc., 109 Hawai' i at 270, 125 P.3d 
at 491 (in examining filed-rate doctrine as applied to sewerage 
tariff filed with Commission, concluding that "we treat the 
construction of a tariff as a question of law") (citing Balthazar 
v. Verizon Hawaii, Inc., 109 Hawai' i 69, 73, 123 P.3d 194, 198 
(2005)). 
12 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In civil cases, the plain error rule is only invoked
 
when "justice so requires." Montalvo v. Lapez, 77 Hawai' i 282, 
290, 884 P.2d 345, 353 (1994) (citation omitted). To that end,
 
"[i]f the substantial rights of a party have been affected
 
adversely, the error will be deemed plain error." Shanghai Inv.
 
Co., Inc. v. Alteka Co., Ltd., 92 Hawai' i 482, 492, 993 P.2d 516, 
526 (2000) (citation omitted). Within this context, the Hawai' i 
Supreme Court has stated that:
 
[T]he appellate court's discretion to address plain
error is always to be exercised sparingly. . . . And,
indeed, in civil cases, we have taken three factors into
account in deciding whether our discretionary power to
notice plain error ought to be exercised: (1) whether
consideration of the issue not raised at trial requires
additional facts; (2) whether its resolution will affect the
integrity of the trial court's findings of fact; and (3)
whether the issue is of great public import.
 
Okada Trucking Co., Ltd. v. Bd. of Water Supply, 97 Hawai' i 450, 
458, 40 P.3d 73, 81 (2002) (citation and brackets omitted); see 
also Liftee v. Boyer, 108 Hawai' i 89, 98-99, 117 P.3d 821, 830­
831 (App. 2004) (declining invocation of plain error doctrine where one of three Okada factors not satisfied). 
IV. DISCUSSION
 
A. The Filed-Rate Doctrine
 
The Hawai' i Supreme Court has adopted the following 
articulation of the filed-rate doctrine, which initially arose in the context of the Interstate Commerce Act: 
The rate of the carrier duly filed is the only lawful
charge. Deviation from it is not permitted upon any
pretext.  Shippers and travelers are charged with notice of
it, and they as well as the carrier must abide by it, unless
it is found by the Commission to be unreasonable.
 
Shippers and carriers were thus bound under the
doctrine to the rate set forth in the duly filed tariff and
were prevented from invoking common-law claims and defenses
such as ignorance, estoppel, or prior agreement to establish
a rate different from the tariff rate.
 
The filed-rate doctrine was eventually applied beyond
the interstate transportation industry, extending across the
spectrum of regulated utilities, with the twin aims of (1)
preventing service or rate discrimination among consumers 
13 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and (2) preventing courts from intruding upon the rate-making
authority of federal agencies.
 
Balthazar, 109 Hawai' i at 73, 123 P.2d at 198 (emphasis in the 
original; citations and internal quotation marks deleted; format
 
altered).
 
The Commission is a regulatory agency statutorily
 
authorized to supervise "public utilities," as defined under HRS
 
§ 269-1. See HRS § 269-6. HRS § 269-16 provides:
 
§ 269-16. Regulation of utility rates; ratemaking
procedures.  (a) All rates, fares, charges,
classifications, schedules, rules, and practices made,
charged, or observed by any public utility...shall be just
and reasonable and shall be filed with the public utilities
commission. . . .
 
(b) No rate, fare, charge, classification, schedule,
rule, or practice, other than one established pursuant to an
automatic rate adjustment clause previously approved by the
commission, shall be established, abandoned, modified, or
departed from by any public utility, except after thirty
days' notice to the commission as prescribed in section
269-12(b), and prior approval by the commission for any
increases in rates, fares, or charges. . . .
 
Thus, HRS § 269-16 "expressly empowers the [Commission] 
to fix rates, charges and practices of any public utility and to 
prohibit rebates and unreasonable discrimination between users and 
customers." Balthazar, 109 Hawai' i at 78, 123 P.3d at 203 
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The Hawai' i 
Supreme Court has interpreted HRS § 269-16 as requiring that a 
public utility's "[r]ates and charges . . . be filed with the 
[Commission] and . . . not be departed from except on prior 
approval of the [Commission]." Id. (quoting Molokoa Village Dev. 
Co., Ltd. v. Kauai Elec. Co., Ltd., 60 Haw. 582, 586, 593 P.2d 375, 379 (1979)). 
Accordingly, and within the specific context of the 
Commission's rate-making authority, the Hawai' i Supreme Court has 
expressly adopted the filed-rate doctrine. See In re Waikoloa 
Sanitary Sewer Co., Inc., 109 Hawai' i at 271-72, 125 P.3d at 492­
93 (applying filed-rate doctrine to sewerage service tariff); 
14  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Balthazar, 109 Hawai' i at 72-73, 82, 123 P.3d at 197-98, 207. 
This doctrine, also known as the filed-tariff doctrine, 
"essentially prohibits a regulated entity from charging rates for 
its services that differ from the rates filed with the appropriate 
federal [or state] regulatory agency." Balthazar, 109 Hawai' i at 
72, 123 P.3d at 197 (citation omitted). The supreme court has recognized that application of the doctrine "may appear harsh" but 
that adherence to the doctrine is necessary in order to advance 
the goals of "promoting nondiscrimination and non-justiciability." 
Id. at 73, 123 P.3d at 198 (citation omitted). 
Pursuant to the doctrine, "filed tariffs govern a 
utility's relationship with its customers and have the force and 
effect of law until suspended or set aside." Waikoloa Sanitary 
Sewer Co., Inc., 109 Hawai' i at 271, 125 P.3d at 492 (internal 
quotation marks and citations omitted). Therefore, "where a 
tariff is unambiguous the parties are bound by its terms." Id. at 
273, 125 P.3d at 494 (citation omitted). Given these principles, "a public utility can enforce payment for its services in 
accordance with its established tariff, notwithstanding any 
agreement to charge less." Balthazar, 109 Hawai' i at 76, 123 P.3d 
at 201 (quoting Molokoa, 60 Haw. at 587, 593 P.2d at 379). 
Additionally, "notice of the terms and rates established 
in a filed tariff is imputed to customers." Waikoloa Sanitary 
Sewer Co., Inc., 109 Hawai' i at 272, 125 P.3d at 493 (internal 
quotation marks and citations omitted). Thus, "[i]gnorance or misquotation of rates is not an excuse for paying or charging 
either less or more than the rate filed," and "even a carrier's 
intentional misrepresentation will not bind the carrier to its 
promised rate if the promise contradicts the rate established in 
the published tariff." Balthazar, 109 Hawai' i at 73, 123 P.3d at 
198 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted, brackets in original). Moreover, "neither the tort of the carrier nor the 
15 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
existence of a contract will work to vary or enlarge the rights
 
defined in a tariff." Id. (citation omitted).
 
B. The Application of the Filed-Rate Doctrine
 Here, the State argues that the Commission erred in
 
concluding that the rates set forth in the 1961 Agreement are
 unenforceable, to the extent they conflict with the 2004 Tariff. 
However, this matter falls squarely within the filed-rate doctrine
 
because: (1) HAWC is a regulated public utility whose 2004 Tariff
 
was duly filed with and approved by the Commission; (2) the State
 
is a HAWC sewerage customer; (3) the 2004 Tariff sets the rates
 
for all HAWC sewerage customers; (4) the application of the 2004
 
Tariff rates to the State conflict with the free services
 
provision in the 1961 Agreement; and (5) the filed-rate doctrine
 
prohibits any deviation or exceptions to the rates of a regulated
 
utility once the rates have been approved and filed by the
 
regulatory agency, notwithstanding any prior agreement to the
 
contrary.
 
The State argues on appeal that the Commission erred
 
because, in approving the 2004 Tariff, the Commission did not
 
approve rates that conflicted with the 1961 Agreement. More
 
specifically, the State argues that the 2004 Tariff was based on
 
and incorporated the "concept" of HAWC continuing to provide free
 
service to the State; therefore, the State argues, there is no
 
conflict between the 2004 Tariff and the free services provision
 
in the 1961 Agreement. Granted, in the Settlement Agreement
 
between HAWC and the Consumer Advocate, HAWC agreed to the
 
Facilities Credit, which imputed income to HAWC in the amount that
 
HAWC would have received had the State (and City) paid for their
 
sewerage services. However, HAWC did so while openly expressing
 
its intent to seek actual compensation from the State for those
 
sewerage services, in light of the imputed revenue. Thus, the
 
State overstates the helpfulness of these concepts to its
 
argument.
 
16 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In any case, the free services provision in the 1961 
Agreement plainly conflicts with the 2004 Tariff. Under the 1961 
Agreement, HAWC is required to provide the State with certain 
sewerage services at no charge. Pursuant to the 2004 Tariff, HAWC 
is required to charge all sewerage customers, which indisputably 
includes the State, a particular rate for sewerage services. In 
other words, regardless of how or why the 2004 Tariff rates were 
set, the contractual provision in the 1961 Agreement relieving the 
State of any payment obligation plainly and unambiguously differs 
from the payment obligation under the 2004 Tariff. Such a result 
is prohibited under the filed-rate doctrine, which specifically 
rejects the enforcement of a promised contract rate that 
contradicts a published tariff rate. See Balthazar, 109 Hawai' i 
at 73, 123 P.3d at 198. 
C. Public Interest Considerations
 
The State argues, erroneously, that the Commission
 
"entirely and inexplicably omits any consideration of the public
 interest considerations that preserve the validity of the 1961
 
Agreement." The State's misapprehension is most likely related to
 
the fact that the "public interest consideration" that the State
 
now asks this court to consider on appeal was not raised in the
 
proceeding before the Commission. As noted above, in response to
 
the Commission's express statement, in Order No. 22254, that an
 
issue for investigation was "the public interest considerations"
 
related to potential unenforceability of the 1961 Agreement, the
 
State argued: (1) if the Commission were to declare the 1961
 
Agreement unenforceable, future utility companies would have
 
difficulty obtaining necessary building and use permits; and (2)
 
if the Commission were to declare the 1961 Agreement
 
unenforceable, the City could potentially purchase the Sewerage
 
System for $1.00 under the terms of the 1961 Agreement. 
The Commission specifically recited and acknowledged
 
both of the State's public interest arguments at page 16 of Order
 
17 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
No. 23725. The Commission rejected, as immaterial, the State's
 
assertion that in the future public utilities might have
 
difficulty obtaining permits if the 1961 Agreement terms were not
 
enforced.5 The Commission rejected, as inaccurate, the State's
 
assertion that a determination that the free services provision of
 the 1961 Agreement is unenforceable would trigger a provision
 
allowing the City to purchase the Sewerage System for $1.00,
 
because that provision is only triggered if the Sewerage System
 
owner and operator intends to abandon the system.

On appeal, the State argues for the first time that
 
even if the filed-rate doctrine is applicable, in executing the
 
1961 Agreement, Kaiser intended to provide the State with free
 
sewerage services as a "charitable contribution." The State
 
argues that this court should establish a charitable purpose
 
exception to the filed-rate doctrine and, implicitly, argues that
 
the free services to the State should be treated as a charitable
 
5/
 The Commission characterized and addressed this argument as
follows: "[The State's] implication that the 1961 Agreement is an impact fee,
and argument that it was provided no notice of the abrogation of the Agreement
since there is no reference of it made in the tariff is immaterial. As HAWC
 correctly states, HAWC is required to charge and collect sewer fees pursuant
to the tariff rates for its customer classes, and thus the rates of the 1961
Agreement cannot stand." In other words, the State was, in essence, arguing
that, if the 1961 Agreement were deemed unenforceable, future utilities permit
applicants might not be able to offer free or discounted future services in
lieu of an "impact fee" for their development. In response, the Commission,
in essence, concluded that the potential for such a consequence was not
material in light of the filed-rate doctrine, which requires HAWC to charge
for all of its sewerage services at the rates set forth in the 2004 Tariff.
 
6/
 Section 9 of the 1961 Agreement states, in relevant part:
 
If at any time Kaiser intends to abandon its operations and
ownership hereunder, it shall, at least 60 days prior to the
date of abandonment, give written notice of such intention
to both Bishop [Estate] and the City. In that event the
 City shall have the right to purchase all of Kaiser's rights
and operations hereunder, including all of Kaiser's right,
title and interest in the sewerage system and all facilities
thereof for the sum of ONE DOLLAR ($1.00).
 
18  
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
contribution.7
 
First, given the State's failure to raise this argument 
in the underlying proceedings, it is deemed waived. See Hawai' i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure 28(b)(4); see also, e.g., In re Water 
Use Permit Applications, 94 Hawai' i 97, 152, 9 P.3d 409, 464 
(2000). 
Moreover, no Hawai' i court has recognized such a 
limitation to the filed-rate doctrine, and the State fails to identify any other state recognizing the requested exception. 
Indeed, the State's characterization of the free services 
provision of the 1961 Agreement as a charitable act appears to be 
inconsistent with the 1961 Agreement's express and unambiguous 
statement that "[t]he parties hereto, in consideration of the 
mutual promises hereinafter contained, agree as follows. . ." As 
noted by the State, Kaiser received, as consideration, the 
contractual right to provide commercial sewerage services to the 
land encompassed under the 1961 Agreement. The City, in turn, 
received consideration in the form of free sewerage services to 
"defray the City's costs related to allowing the development in 
that area." The State's charitable contribution argument fails, 
in part, because the provision of free sewerage services was not a 
charitable contribution. 
D. The Contract Clause
 The State's third point of error, that the "PUC erred
 
in failing to apply the heightened standard applicable when the
 State's exercise of its police powers interferes with its own
 
contractual obligations," relates to the Contracts Clause of the
 
United States Constitution. Article I, section 10, of the
 
Constitution states, in relevant part: "No State shall . . . pass
 
any . . . Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts[.]" As the
 
State acknowledges, "[d]espite the sweeping terms of its literal
 
7/
 In a footnote, however, the State acknowledges that it is not a
charitable organization in the "traditional" sense.
 
19 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
text, the Supreme Court has construed this prohibition narrowly in
 
order to ensure that local governments retain the flexibility to
 
exercise their police powers effectively." Matsuda v. City &
 
County of Honolulu, 512 F.3d 1148, 1152 (9th Cir. 2008).
 
As a threshold matter, the State failed to raise any
 
Contracts Clause or other constitutional challenge in the
 proceedings before the PUC and presents no argument in support of
 
a plain error review.
8 Accordingly, this issue is waived. See
 
HRAP Rule 28(b)(4).
 
In any case, the legal authorities invoked by the State
 
in support of its argument have required heightened scrutiny when
 
a state law interferes with the state's contractual obligations,
 
rather than when a state's enactment diminishes that state's
 
benefits under a contract. See Matsuda, 512 F.3d at 1152 (citing
 
U.S. Trust Co. v. New Jersey, 431 U.S. 1, 20-21 (1977)). It
 appears that courts have uniformly held that municipalities cannot
 
invoke the Contracts Clause against the abrogation of contracts by
 
state law. See, e.g., City of Trenton v. New Jersey, 262 U.S.
 
182, 186-87 (1923); City of Worcester v. Worcester Consol. Street
 Railway Co., 196 U.S. 539 (1905); City of Plainfield v. Public
 
Serv. Elec. & Gas Co., 82 N.J. 245, 412 A.2d 759 (1980);
 
Metropolitan Dev. & Hsg. Agency v. South Central Bell Telephone
 
Co., 562 S.W.2d 438, 442-43 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1977); Alameda County
 
v. Janssen, 16 Cal.2d 276, 284, 106 P.2d 11, 15-16 (1940). It is 
axiomatic that an assignee stands in the shoes of its assignor and 
that an assignment of rights provides the assignee with "the same 
legal rights as the assignor had before assignment." Fireman's 
Fund Ins. Co. v. AIG Hawai' i Ins. Co., Inc., 109 Hawai' i 343, 349, 
126 P.3d 386, 392 (2006) (citation omitted). Here, the State 
8/
 The State, instead, "asks this court to decide as a matter of law
that the impairment of the State's interest in the 1961 Agreement was not
reasonable or necessary to fulfill the public purpose of utility regulation."
The State has not, however, cited a single case in support of its theory that
government bodies, as a matter of law, should be exempted from the filed-rate
doctrine.
 
20 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
stands in the shoes of the City and thus cannot invoke the
 
Contracts Clause in this case.
 
E. The Amicus Brief
 Finally, the State argues that the Commission's failure
 
to disclose the Amicus Brief filed by the Commission in the
 Shopping Center Litigation created an appearance of impropriety
 
that warrants the vacating of Order No. 23725. The State
 
concedes, however, that there is no record evidence of actual bias
 
on the part of the Commission and further acknowledges its failure
 
to raise this contention in the proceedings below. 
In Hawai' i, and within the specific context of 
administrative proceedings, a "party asserting grounds for 
disqualification must timely present the objection, either before 
the commencement of the proceeding or as soon as the disqualifying 
facts become known." In re Water Use Permit Applications, 94 
Hawai'i at 122, 9 P.3d at 434 (citations omitted). Thus, the 
"unjustified failure to properly raise the issue of 
disqualification before the agency forecloses any subsequent 
challenges to the decisionmakers' qualifications on appeal." Id. 
(citations omitted); see also Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Au, 107 Hawai' i 327, 338, 113 P.3d 203, 214 (2005) ("Unless the 
matters of disqualification are unknown to the party at the time of the proceeding and are newly discovered, there can be no excuse 
for delaying the filing of the suggestion until after rulings are 
made in the matter, particularly where such rulings may be 
considered adverse to the movant.") (internal quotation marks and 
citation omitted). 
The State indisputably failed to raise this argument in
 
the underlying proceedings despite the disclosure of the Amicus
 
Brief in May of 2006, approximately 17 months prior to the
 
Commission's final decision in Order No. 23725. The State's
 
21 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
unexplained acquiescence is dispositive.9 See In re Water Use 
Permit Applications, 94 Hawai' i at 122-123, 9 P.3d at 434-435 
(citations omitted) (rejecting appellate disqualification argument 
given party's failure to raise the contention in underlying 
administrative proceeding); see also Au, 107 Hawai' i at 339, 113 
P.3d at 215 ("Litigants cannot take the heads-I-win-tails-you-lose position of waiting to see whether they win and if they lose 
moving to disqualify a judge who voted against them."). 
V. CONCLUSION
 
For these reasons, Order No. 22254 and Order No. 23725
 
are affirmed.

 We further note that, within the context of judge recusals, "a
party who has made no motion for recusal in the trial court bears the burden
on appeal in demonstrating that the judge committed plain error in failing torecuse[] himself or herself." State v. Gomes, 93 Hawai' i 13, 17, 995 P.2d
314, 318 (2000) (citations omitted). In this regard, the mere "appearance ofimpropriety," as solely alleged by the State in this matter, has been heldinsufficient to demonstrate an affect on the substantial rights of the partiesfor purposes of plain error review. See id. ("if a judge proceeds in a case
when there is (only) an appearance of impropriety in his doing so, the injuryis to the judicial system as a whole and not to the substantial rights of theparties.") (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
