APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

 
(CIVIL NO. 04-1-0099)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION

 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant-Appellant Pila 'a 400, 
LLC (Pila 'a 400) appeals from the Final Judgment Under Rule 54(b) 
as to the April 12, 2007 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law,
 
Order (Judgment) filed on January 25, 2008 in the Circuit Court
 of the Fifth Circuit (circuit court).
1 The Judgment was issued
 
pursuant to the circuit court's Findings of Fact; Conclusions of
 Law; Order (FOF/COL/Order) filed on April 12, 2007, and Order
 Denying Plaintiff Pila
'a 400, LLC's Motion for Approval of

 The Honorable Kathleen N.A. Watanabe presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
entered judgment in favor of Defendant/Counterclaimant-Appellee 
Carlos Lawrence Andrade (Andrade) and against Pila 'a 400. 
On appeal, Pila 'a 400 contends: 
(1) The circuit court erred in granting Andrade's2 
Motion for Summary Judgment (Andrade's MSJ) and ordering Pila 'a 
400 to execute and record a formal grant of easement (easement) in favor of Andrade over Pila
'a 400's property (alternatively, 
Pila'a 400's Property or its property). Related to this argument 
is Pila'a 400's contention that Conclusion of Law (COL) 17 is wrong; 
(2) The circuit court abused its discretion and issued
 
clearly erroneous Findings of Fact (FOFs) 43-44, 48-51, 53-58,
 60-61, 63 (part), 67, 69-70, 76-79, 85-88, and 91 and wrong COLs
 32-42, 54-61, and 63-75 when it granted Andrade's Motion for
 Preliminary Injunction" (Andrade's Preliminary Injunction Motion) 
with respect to Andrade's entitlement to maintain a water
 diversion and distribution system (alternatively, auwai
3 or water
 
system).
 
(3) The circuit court erred in its "Order Granting in 
Part and Denying in Part [Andrade's] Motion to Enforce and for Contempt Filed July 16, 2007" (Order Grant/Deny Andrade's Enforce/Contempt Motion) by (a) imposing a $1,000-per-day sanction against Pila
'a 400 without finding Pila 'a 400 was in 
contempt and (b) ordering Pila 'a 400 to pay Andrade's attorneys' 
fees and costs. 
Pila'a 400 asks this court to reverse the Order 
Grant/Deny Andrade's Enforce/Contempt Motion and the Judgment on the FOF/COL/Order. 
2
 Andrade's MSJ was filed by Andrade and Makalii Sun Chiang Andrade
(Makalii) on June 22, 2006. On July 27, 2006, the parties stipulated to
dismiss all of Pila' a 400's claims against Makalii and Makalii's counterclaims
against Pila' a 400. For the sake of simplicity, in our discussion of the
early background of the case we will refer to Andrade and Makalii collectivelyas "Andrade."

 An "auwai" is a "ditch" or "canal." Mary Kawena Pukui & Samuel H.
Elbert, Hawaiian Dictionary at 33 (1986). At the evidentiary hearing, Andrade
testified that an auwai is a "ditch that leads water from the source of the
 water to the land at the elevation that you desire . . . [to provide] water
for the field system that you have in place."

I. BACKGROUND
 
This case involves a dispute between Pila 'a 400 and 
Andrade over the scope of Andrade's rights to enter onto and 
through Pila 'a 400's Property to access water from its property. 
Andrade has an ownership interest in parcels of land designated 
4
as TMKs 5-1-00-004-025 (the lo 'i parcel) and 5-1-00-004-026(4)
5
(the pa hale  parcel), which are part of one kuleana (the Banana
6
Patch Kuleana  ), and TMKs 5-1-00-04-017 and 5-1-00-04-019(4),
which are part of another kuleana (the Waterfall Kuleana) (collectively, Andrade's Property or his property). 
Andrade's 
Property is located wholly within Pila 'a 400's Property, 
designated as Parcels 8 and 37, TMK (4)-5-1-04, at Pila 'a, 
Hanalei, Kauai.7 
On August 19, 2004, Pila 'a 400 filed a Complaint 
against Andrade. Pila 'a 400 claimed that in May and June 2004, 
Andrade entered onto Pila 'a 400's property and chopped down live 
trees, left debris, and "placed fraudulent boundary pins, markers and monuments" on Pila
'a 400's property without Pila 'a 400's 
permission. Pila 'a 400 alleged that Andrade committed trespass, 
nuisance, waste, conversion, encroachment, and slander of title. 
On September 27, 2004, Andrade filed an answer to the 
Complaint and a counterclaim. Andrade admitted that he had regularly entered onto and traversed portions of Pila
'a 400's 
Property. However, he claimed he did so pursuant to his rights as a kuleana land owner and his status as a Native Hawaiian tenant of the ahupua
'a in which Pila 'a 400's Property is located 
4
 A "lo'i" is an "irrigated terrace, especially for taro." Pukui & 
Elbert, supra, at 209. 
5
 A "pa hale" is a "[h]ouse lot, yard, fence." Pukui & Elbert, supra,
 
at 299. 
6
 A "kuleana" is "a small piece of property, as within an ahupua' a." 
Pukui & Elbert, supra, at 179. An "ahupua' a" is a "[l]and division usually
extending from the uplands to the sea." Id. at 9.
7
 The Pila' a 400 Property is part of a 383-acre parcel of land owned by
Pila'a 400. The 383-acre parcel was conveyed to Pila' a 400 by James Pflueger,
owner of Pflueger Properties, after Pflueger Properties acquired it by Limited
Warranty Deed from Paul Richard Cassiday and James H. Pflueger, SuccessorTrustees under the Will and of the Estate of Mary N. Lucas, deceased, and T.G.Exchange, Inc.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
"to engage in the exercise of constitutionally protected native 
Hawaiian rights." Andrade also admitted that in May and June 2004, he had trimmed and cut down trees on Pila
'a 400's Property, 
but argued he had done so because the trees had presented a health and safety hazard to his property and/or because he needed to clear, repair, restore, and utilize taro lo
'i on his property. 
He maintained that the trees were not wholly located on or within Pila
'a 400's Property boundary. 
8
Andrade counterclaimed that Pila 'a 400 had
(1) denied him reasonable access to his property and

 
the land and water adjacent thereto so he could exercise his
 "constitutionally protected traditional and customary native
 Hawaiian rights for subsistence, cultural and religious purposes"
 (First Counterclaim -– Violation of Constitutionally Protected
 Traditional and Customary Native Hawaiian Rights);
 
(2) trespassed upon the Waterfall Kuleana (Second
 
Counterclaim -– Trespass);
 
(3) damaged a portion of the Waterfall Kuleana (Third
 
Counterclaim –- Property Damage);
 
(4) converted his property rights and common law
 
rights and interests in adjacent land and waters associated with
 the Waterfall Kuleana (Fourth Counterclaim -– Conversion); and
 
(5) encroached upon the Waterfall Kuleana (Fifth
 
Counterclaim -– Encroachment).
 
Andrade requested a judgment (1) declaring that Pila
'a 
400's conduct had violated his constitutional rights; (2) enjoining Pila
'a 400 from abridging or denying his constitutional 
rights to engage in traditional, customary Native Hawaiian subsistence, cultural, and religious practices in, on, and around his property; (3) enjoining Pila
'a 400 from entering on or 
exercising any control or authority over any portion of his property; and (4) awarding him attorney's fees and costs. 
8
 In the counterclaim, Andrade actually referred to "[Pila' a 400] and
its managers, employees, and/or agents." However, for the sake of simplicity,
where the circuit court or parties refer to Pila' a 400 and/or its managers,
employees, agents, representatives, assigns, lessees, sublessees, and thelike, we substitute "Pila' a 400." 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
On October 28, 2004, Pila 'a 400 filed a reply to 
Andrade's counterclaims and asserted various affirmative 
defenses. 
On June 22, 2006, Andrade filed Andrade's MSJ. He 
sought an order of summary judgment against Pila 'a 400 and an 
order permanently enjoining Pila 'a 400 from denying him access to 
the Waterfall Kuleana and his constitutional and statutory right to engage in traditional and customary Native Hawaiian practices within Pila
'a 400's property. He claimed that there were no 
genuine issues of material fact regarding whether he had the right to access into and through Pila
'a 400's property for that 
purpose. 
On July 26, 2006, Pila 'a 400 filed a memorandum in 
opposition to Andrade's MSJ. Pila 'a 400 argued that the circuit 
court should not grant Andrade's MSJ because when viewed in the light most favorable to Pila
'a 400, the facts of the case showed 
that Andrade did not have the access rights he claimed. Pila 'a 
400 contended that there were genuine issues of material fact regarding the historic location of access routes from Andrade's Property through Pila
'a 400's Property, the scope and nature of 
such routes, and what constituted reasonable use of the routes. Pila
'a 400 maintained that before the circuit court could 
determine a kuleana owner's rights of ingress and egress, the court had to hold an evidentiary hearing. On July 31, 2006, Andrade filed a reply memorandum. 
At the August 3, 2006 hearing on Andrade's MSJ, the 
circuit court orally granted summary judgment in favor of Andrade and against Pila
'a 400 with respect to Pila 'a 400's slander of 
title claim. The circuit court denied the remainder of the MSJ on the basis that the court had to hold an evidentiary hearing before rendering a judgment on those issues. On September 15, 2006, the circuit court filed an order granting in part and denying in part Andrade's MSJ (Order Grant/Deny Andrade's MSJ), which memorialized the court's oral rulings. 
On September 27, 2006, the circuit court granted an ex
 
parte motion for temporary restraining order (TRO) filed by
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Andrade. The TRO enjoined Pila 'a 400 from (1) interfering with 
or destroying Andrade's Banana Patch auwai, (2) denying Andrade 
access to the auwai so he could repair it, and (3) harassing or attempting to intimidate Andrade or his family in their use and enjoyment of Andrade's property. 
On September 27, 2006, Andrade also filed Andrade's 
Preliminary Injunction Motion. Andrade requested an order from the circuit court restraining and enjoining Pila
'a 400 from 
damaging, dismantling, destroying, or otherwise interfering with Andrade's "auwai which takes water from Wailoli Stream for domestic use and taro irrigation" on the lo
'i parcel of the 
Banana Patch Kuleana. Andrade claimed that the auwai was currently the Banana Patch Kuleana's sole water source. He also requested that the circuit court prevent and restrain Pila
'a 400 
from harassing and attempting to intimidate Andrade and his family in their use and enjoyment of Andrade's Property. 
On November 20, 2006, Pila
'a 400 filed a memorandum in 
opposition to Andrade's Preliminary Injunction Motion. Pila 'a 
400 admitted that it had removed part of Andrade's water system, which diverted water from an area on Pila
'a 400's Property to 
Andrade's Property, but claimed that Andrade's water system was illegal and constituted a nuisance and an ongoing trespass onto Pila
'a 400's Property. 
Andrade filed a reply memorandum. Andrade argued that 
he had the right to use his water system for domestic and agricultural purposes, according to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 1-1 (2009 Repl.) and § 7-1 (2009 Repl.), the doctrine of appurtenant kuleana rights, and article XII, section 7 of the Hawai
'i Constitution. 
After December 8, 2006, January 26, 2007, and March 2,
 
2007 evidentiary hearings on Andrade's MSJ and Andrade's
 Preliminary Injunction Motion, the circuit court filed its
 FOF/COL/Order, which provided:
 
ORDER
 
The Court therefore hereby grants [Andrade's MSJ]
. . . with respect to an easement by necessity for the
Waterfall [K]uleana and enters an Order (1) Granting an
Easement by Necessity to the Waterfall Kuleana over and
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
through [Pila' a 400's Property], (2) Defining the Easement,
and (3) Enjoining and Restraining [Pila' a 400] From
Interfering With, Blocking Or Otherwise Making [Andrade's]
Access Unreasonable or Unsafe. [Andrade] shall present to[Pila'a 400], and [Pila'  400] shall execute and record a Non
Exclusive Grant of Easement in favor of [Andrade] for theWaterfall [K]uleana. 
The Court also hereby grants [Andrade's Preliminary
Injunction Motion] . . . and enters an Order PermanentlyEnjoining and Restraining [Pila' a 400] From Interfering
With, Dismantling, Damaging And/Or Destroying [Andrade's]Water Delivery System Which Delivers Water from WailoliStream To Both The Lo' i Parcel And House Parcel [pa hale
parcel] of Banana Patch Kuleana. 
On July 16, 2007, Andrade filed a Motion to Enforce and 
for Contempt (Andrade's Enforce/Contempt Motion). He sought an 
order from the circuit court (1) compelling Pila 'a 400 to comply 
with the portion of the FOF/COL/Order in which the court found and defined an easement by necessity to the Waterfall Kuleana in favor of Andrade and instructed Pila
'a 400 to execute and record 
an easement to the Waterfall Kuleana through Pila 'a 400's 
property, and (2) finding Pila 'a 400 in contempt for its failure 
to execute and record the easement, as required by the FOF/COL/Order. 
On September 25, 2007, Pila
'a filed a responsive 
memorandum regarding its efforts to comply with the FOF/COL/Order. Pila
'a 400 argued that the circuit court should 
not sanction Pila 'a 400, even though Pila 'a 400 had not executed 
an easement in favor of Andrade. Pila 'a 400 maintained that its 
efforts to execute the easement had stalled due to remediation work Pila
'a 400 was doing on its property pursuant to a consent 
decree (consent decree) Pila 'a 400 had entered into in United 
States of America & Department of Health, State of Hawaii, et al. v. James H. Pflueger, Pflueger Properties, and Pila
'a 400 LLC, 
United States District Court for the District of Hawaii, Civil No. 06-00140 SPK-BMK. Pila
'a 400 also maintained that its day-
to-day administrator, Gordon Rosa (Rosa), had fallen ill. On October 15, 2007, Andrade filed a reply memorandum. 
On October 19, 2007, the circuit court held a hearing 
on the motion. The circuit court filed the Order Grant/Deny Andrade's Enforce/Contempt Motion on November 7, 2007. The circuit court ordered Pila
'a 400 to take any and all steps 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
necessary to execute and record an easement in favor of Andrade 
by December 19, 2007. The court imposed a $1,000 sanction for each day after December 19, 2007 that Pila
'a 400 failed to 
execute and record an easement and ordered Pila 'a 400 to pay 
$15,509.29 in attorneys' fees and costs to Andrade for having to file and litigate Andrade's Enforce/Contempt Motion. The circuit court specifically denied Andrade's Enforce/Contempt Motion insofar as it asked the court "to find PILA
'A 400 in civil 
contempt arising out of and connected with the [FOF/COL/Order]." 
On November 19, 2007, Pila 'a 400 filed a notice of 
appeal from the Order Grant/Deny Andrade's Enforce/Contempt Motion. On November 21, 2007, Pila
'a 400 filed a Motion for 
Approval of Supersedeas Bond and for Stay Pending Appeal or, in the Alternative, for Rule 54(b) Certification. Pila
'a 400 
requested approval of a supersedeas bond and a stay of enforcement of the Order Grant/Deny Andrade's Enforce/Contempt Motion, pending Pila
'a 400's appeal of the order. In case the 
circuit court found that the Order Grant/Enforce Andrade's Enforce/Contempt Motion was not appealable, Pila
'a 400 requested 
alternatively that the court enter an Hawaii Rules of Civil 
9
Procedure (HRCP) Rule 54(b)  final judgment as to the issues in
the FOF/COL/Order. Andrade filed a memorandum in opposition, and Pila
'a 400 filed a reply. The circuit court held a hearing on 
the motion, and on January 3, 2008, the court filed its Order Denying Plaintiff Pila
'a 400, LLC's Motion for Approval of 
Supersedeas Bond and for Stay Pending Appeal and Granting Rule 54(b) Certification. 
The court filed the Judgment on January 25, 2008, and 
Pila'a 400 timely appealed. 
9
 HRCP Rule 54(b) provides in relevant part:
 
Rule 54. Judgments; costs; attorneys' fees.
. . . .
 
(b) Judgments on multiple claims or involving multiple
parties.  When more than one claim for relief is presented in an
action, whether as a claim . . . [or] counterclaim, . . . the
court may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or more
but fewer than all of the claims[.]

II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
A. SUMMARY JUDGMENT
 
"We review the circuit court's grant or denial of
 
summary judgment de novo." Querubin v. Thronas, 107 Hawai 'i 48, 
56, 109 P.3d 689, 697 (2005) (quoting Durette v. Aloha Plastic
 
Recycling, Inc., 105 Hawai 'i 490, 501, 100 P.3d 60, 71 (2004)). 
The Hawai 'i Supreme Court has often articulated that 
summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there
is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. A
 fact is material if proof of that fact would have the effect
of establishing or refuting one of the essential elements of
a cause of action or defense asserted by the parties. The
 evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the
non-moving party. In other words, we must view all of the
evidence and the inferences drawn therefrom in the light
most favorable to the party opposing the motion.
 
Querubin, 107 Hawai 'i at 56, 109 P.3d at 697 (quoting Durette, 
105 Hawai 'i at 501, 100 P.3d at 71). 
HRCP Rule 56(e) provides in relevant part:
 
Rule 56. Summary judgment.
. . . . 
(e) Form of affidavits; further testimony; defense
required . . . . When a motion for summary judgment [(MSJ)]
is made . . . ., an adverse party may not rest upon the mere
allegations or denials of the adverse party's pleading, but
the adverse party's response, by affidavits or as otherwise
provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing
that there is a genuine issue for trial. If the adverse
 party does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate,
shall be entered against the adverse party.
 
Thus, "a party opposing a[n] [MSJ] cannot discharge his
 
or her burden by alleging conclusions, nor is the party entitled
 
to a trial on the basis of a hope that the party can produce some
 evidence at that time." Henderson v. Prof'l Coatings Corp., 72
 Haw. 387, 401, 819 P.2d 84, 92 (1991) (internal quotation marks,
 citations, and brackets in original omitted).
B. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

 
Generally, the granting or denying of injunctive
relief rests with the sound discretion of the trial court
 
and the trial court's decision will be sustained absent a
 showing of a manifest abuse of discretion. Abuse of
 discretion may be found where the trial court lacked
jurisdiction to grant the relief, or where the trial court
based its decision on an unsound proposition of law.

Sierra Club v. Dep't of Transp., 120 Hawai 'i 181, 197, 202 P.3d 
1226, 1242 (2009) (quoting Hawai 'i Pub. Employment Relations Bd. 
v. United Pub. Workers, Local 646, AFSCME, AFL-CIO, 66 Haw. 461,
 
467-68, 667 P.2d 783, 788 (1983)).
C. EQUITABLE RELIEF
 
"The relief granted by a court in equity is 
discretionary and will not be overturned on review unless the circuit court abused its discretion by issuing a decision that clearly exceeds the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of the appellant." Aickin v. Ocean View Invs. Co., Inc., 84 Hawai
'i 
447, 453, 935 P.2d 992, 998 (1997) (internal quotation marks, citation, and brackets omitted).
D. FOFs AND COLs
 
"In this jurisdiction, a trial court's FOFs are subject 
to the clearly erroneous standard of review. An FOF is clearly erroneous when, despite evidence to support the finding, the appellate court is left with the definite and firm conviction in reviewing the entire evidence that a mistake has been committed.” Chun v. Bd. of Trs. of the Employees' Ret. Sys. of the State of Hawai
'i, 106 Hawai 'i 416, 430, 106 P.3d 339, 353 (2005) (internal 
quotation marks, citations, and ellipses omitted) (quoting Allstate Ins. Co. v. Ponce, 105 Hawai
'i 445, 453, 99 P.3d 96, 104 
(2004)). "An FOF is also clearly erroneous when the record lacks substantial evidence to support the finding. We have defined substantial evidence as credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion." Leslie v. Estate of Tavares, 
91 Hawai
'i 394, 399, 984 P.2d 1220, 1225 (1999) (internal 
quotation marks and citations omitted) (quoting State v. Kotis, 91 Hawai
'i 319, 328, 984 P.2d 78, 87 (1999)). 
A COL is not binding upon an appellate court and is
freely reviewable for its correctness. This court
 
ordinarily reviews COLs under the right/wrong standard.
Thus, a COL that is supported by the trial court's FOFs and
that reflects an application of the correct rule of law will
not be overturned. However, a COL that presents mixed
questions of fact and law is reviewed under the clearly
erroneous standard because the court's conclusions are
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
dependent upon the facts and circumstances of each
individual case.
 
Chun, 106 Hawai 'i at 430, 106 P.3d at 353 (internal quotation 
marks, citations, and brackets in original omitted) (quoting
 
Ponce, 105 Hawai 'i at 453, 99 P.3d at 104).
E. HARMLESS ERROR
 
Hawaii Rules of Evidence Rule 103(a) provides in
 
relevant part: "Error may not be predicated upon a ruling which
 admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the
 party is affected[.]"
F. STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION
 
When construing a statute, . . . [this court is]
guided by several well-established principles of statutory
construction:
 
First, the fundamental starting point for

statutory interpretation is the language of the
statute itself. Second, where the statutory language
is plain and unambiguous, our sole duty is to give
effect to its plain and obvious meaning. Third,
implicit in the task of statutory construction is our
foremost obligation to ascertain and give effect to
the intention of the legislature, which is to be
obtained primarily from the language contained in the
statute itself. Fourth, when there is doubt,
doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness or
uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, an
ambiguity exists. And fifth, in construing an
ambiguous statute, the meaning of the ambiguous words
may be sought by examining the context, with which the
ambiguous words, phrases, and sentences may be
compared, in order to ascertain their true meaning.
Moreover, the courts may resort to extrinsic aids in
determining the legislative intent. One avenue is the
 use of legislative history as an interpretive tool.
 
Hui Malama I Na Kupuna O Nei v. Wal-Mart, 122 Hawai 'i 171, 178, 
223 P.3d 236, 243 (App. 2009), cert. rejected, No. 28477, 2010 WL
 
1973594 (May 17, 2010) (quoting Peterson v. Hawaii Elec. Light
 Co., 85 Hawai
'i 322, 327-28, 944 P.2d 1265, 1270-71 (1997), 
superseded on other grounds by HRS § 269-15.5 (Supp. 1999)).
G. ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS
 
As a general rule, each party is responsible for
paying his or her own litigation expenses. This American
 
Rule is subject to several exceptions that allow fee-
shifting wherein the losing party pays the fees of the
prevailing party when so authorized by statute, rule of
court, agreement, stipulation, or precedent.

11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
trial court's grant or denial of attorney's fees and costs is 
reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard." Sierra Club v. 
Dep't of Transp., 120 Hawai 'i at 197, 202 P.3d at 1242 (internal 
quotation marks, citation, and brackets omitted).
H. SANCTIONS
 
This court reviews a trial court's order imposing 
sanctions pursuant to the trial court's inherent powers under the abuse of discretion standard. Enos v. Pac. Transfer & Warehouse,

III. DISCUSSION
 
A. ANDRADE'S MSJ
 
Pila'a 400 contends the circuit court erred in its 
FOF/COL/Order when it ordered Pila 'a 400 to execute and record an 
easement over its property in favor of Andrade. Pila 'a 400 
argues that (1) the circuit court lacked authority to require such recordation; (2) the court had previously denied Andrade's MSJ with regard to his easement rights, and such rights were no longer in issue at the time the court filed its FOF/COL/Order; and (3) to the extent that the recordation requirement can be construed as injunctive relief, it was an abuse of discretion. Related to this argument is Pila
'a 400's contention that COL 17 
is wrong. COL 17 provides that "[n]on-exclusive easements to both the Waterfall [K]uleana and the Banana Patch [K]uleana shall be recorded." 
In Andrade's MSJ, Andrade argued that there was no 
genuine issue of material fact regarding whether he had the right to access into and through Pila
'a 400's Property for the purpose 
of engaging in traditional and customary Native Hawaiian practices. In Pila
'a 400's memorandum in opposition, Pila 'a 
contended that there were genuine issues of material fact regarding the historic location of access routes from Andrade's Property through Pila
'a 400's Property, the scope and nature of 
such routes, and what constituted reasonable use of the routes. At the August 3, 2006 hearing on Andrade's MSJ, the circuit court orally granted Andrade's MSJ with regard to Pila
'a 400's slander 
of title claim. The circuit court found that although Andrade 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
had rights of ingress and egress across Pila 'a 400's Property for 
the purpose of accessing the Waterfall Kuleana, there were 
genuine issues of material fact as to the scope and nature of Andrade's access rights. The circuit court orally denied the remainder of Andrade's MSJ on that basis and stated that the court had to hold an evidentiary hearing before it could rule on those issues. Neither party objected. The circuit court later filed its Order Grant/Deny Andrade's MSJ, in which the court generally denied Andrade's MSJ on all but the slander of title claim. 
The circuit court held a hearing on Andrade's MSJ and 
Andrade's Preliminary Injunction Motion combined, at which hearing Pila
'a 400 and Andrade called various witnesses to 
testify regarding, among other things, Andrade's rights of ingress and egress onto and through Pila
'a 400's Property. On 
March 2, 2007, the circuit court conducted a site inspection. On March 23, 2007, Andrade filed his Written Closing Argument, in which he requested a recorded easement for the first time. On April 12, 2007, the circuit court issued the FOF/COL/Order, in which it ordered Pila
'a 400 to record a non-exclusive grant of 
easement in Andrade's favor. 
HRCP Rule 56(c) provides that a court shall grant an
 
MSJ "if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories,
 and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,
 show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and
 that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of
 law." HRCP Rule 56(d) provides:
 
(d) Case not fully adjudicated on motion.  If on
 
motion under this rule judgment is not rendered upon the
whole case or for all the relief asked and a trial is
 necessary, the court at the hearing of the motion, by
examining the pleadings and the evidence before it and by
interrogating counsel, shall if practicable ascertain what
material facts exist without substantial controversy and
what material facts are actually and in good faith
controverted. It shall thereupon make an order specifying
the facts that appear without substantial controversy,
including the extent to which the amount of damages or other
relief is not in controversy, and directing such further
proceedings in the action as are just. Upon the trial of
the action the facts so specified shall be deemed
established, and the trial shall be conducted accordingly.
 
13
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
If, upon an MSJ, the trial court finds a genuine issue of
 
material fact, it should either set the case for trial or at
 least hold an evidentiary hearing to address the issue. Miller
 
v. Manuel, 9 Haw. App. 56, 64, 828 P.2d 286, 292 (1991). See
 
also Gilmartin v. Abastillas, 10 Haw. App. 283, 296, 869 P.2d
 1346, 1352 (1994) (An MSJ "should not be granted where there is a
 factual question as to the existence, validity, and terms of the
 alleged settlement agreement, and where such a dispute exists, a
 trial or an evidentiary hearing to resolve the dispute is
 required.") (citing to Miller, 9 Haw. App. at 64, 828 P.2d at
 292). 
We fail to understand why the circuit court in this 
case granted Andrade's MSJ on the issue of Andrade's access into and through Pila
'a 400's Property to the Waterfall Kuleana after 
the court had denied Andrade's MSJ with respect to all but the slander of title claim in Pila
'a 400's Complaint. On appeal, 
however, Pila 'a 400 only contests the portion of the order 
granting Andrade's MSJ requiring recordation. For the first time, Andrade asserted in his Written Closing Argument that he was "entitled to a non-exclusive recorded easement of reasonable vehicular access to the Waterfall [K]uleana." He provided no authority or further argument for this assertion. This relief had not been requested in Andrade's counterclaim, his MSJ, or his motion for a preliminary injunction. Neither the circuit court nor Andrade cited to any authority to support the recordation requirement, and we find none. COL 17 is wrong, and the circuit court erroneously required recordation. Our holding does not concern the remainder of the Order Grant/Deny Andrade's MSJ because Pila
'a 400 does not contest the remainder of the order as 
it relates to the MSJ. 
B. ANDRADE'S PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION MOTION
 
Pila'a 400 contends the circuit court abused its 
discretion and issued various clearly erroneous FOFs and wrong COLs when it granted Andrade's Preliminary Injunction Motion with respect to Andrade's entitlement to maintain the water system. 
14
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Andrade diverted water from a portion of Wailoli Stream located
 
on Pila 'a 400's Property to Andrade's Property.
1. Appurtenant water rights
 
Pila'a 400 argues that the circuit court erred in 
ruling contrary to the evidence presented that Andrade's water
 system constitutes the revitalization of an ancient and historic
 source of water to the lo
'i parcel such that Andrade has 
appurtenant rights to the water. Alternatively, Pila 'a 400 
argues that even if Andrade established appurtenant water rights
 to the lo
'i parcel, Andrade's rights do not extend to the pa hale 
parcel. Related to these arguments is Pila 'a 400's contention 
that in the FOF/COL/Order, FOFs 48-51, 60-61, 77-79, and 91 and a
 portion of FOF 63 are clearly erroneous and COLs 54-59 are wrong.
 
COLs 54-59 provide:

 
54. In the instant case, it is clear that both
parcels of the Banana Patch Kuleana were utilized for taro
cultivation and domestic purposes as demonstrated by the
language of LCA [Land Commission Award] 6640,
[10] and the
 
native and foreign testimonies related to LCA 6640.
 
55. In addition, the traditional water system that
Andrade uses to service both parcels of the Banana Patch
[K]uleana, is a restoration of what appeared to be an
ancient ditch system in place since time immemorial, when
Andrade first entered the Banana Patch [K]uleana and its
adjoining areas.
 
56. Andrade is utilizing the lo' i parcel of the
Banana Patch [K]uleana to cultivate traditional products bymeans approximating those utilized at the time of theMahele. 
57. This traditional water system is also the
primary means of domestic water for the pa hale parcel.
 
58. As such, Andrade, through this traditional water
system, is entitled to an appurtenant right to provide water
to his kuleana for agricultural and domestic purposes.
 
59. Further, because Andrade has clearly
demonstrated that he is utilizing the lo' i parcel of the
Banana Patch [K]uleana to cultivate traditional products bymeans approximating those utilized at the time of theMahele, he is therefore entitled to the quantity and flow ofwater which was utilized on this parcel to irrigate six tarolo'i, kula land, land for noni, and domestic uses. 
10
 The circuit court found that a "Limited Warranty Deed was made
subject to the rights of access and utility in favor of certain kuleanalocated within the perimeter of [Pila' a], including . . . the "Banana Patch
Kuleana" which is identified at page 3 of the Deed as Royal Patent Number(None) Land Commission Award Number 6640, Apana 1 and 2 to Nika[.]" 
15 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
a.	 Quantity of water to which Andrade is
entitled
 
Contrary to Pila 'a 400's contention on appeal, the 
circuit court's finding that Andrade's water system constituted
 
the revitalization of an ancient and historic source of water to
 the lo
'i parcel is not relevant to whether Andrade has 
appurtenant rights to the water, but the amount of water to which
 he is entitled. COLs 52 and 59 provide:
 
52. When the same parcels of land are being utilized
to cultivate traditional products by means approximating
those utilized at the time of the Mahele, there is
sufficient evidence to establish a presumption that the
amount of water diverted for such cultivation adequately
approximates the quantity of the appurtenant water rights to
which that land is entitled. [Reppun v. Bd. of Water
 Supply, 65 Haw. 531, 564 (1982)].
. . . . 
59. . . . [B]ecause Andrade has clearly demonstrated
that he is utilizing the lo' i parcel of the Banana Patch
[K]uleana to cultivate traditional products by means
approximating those utilized at the time of the Mahele, heis therefore entitled to the quantity and flow of waterwhich was utilized on this parcel to irrigate six taro lo' i,
kula land, land for noni, and domestic uses. 
COLs 54-59 are based in part on FOFs 48-51 and 60-61,
 
which summarize and refer to Andrade's testimony; FOFs 77-79,
 
which describe the testimony of Joseph O'Hagan (O'Hagan); and FOF
 91, which describes the testimony of Brian Lansing (Lansing). 
Pila
'a 400 claims, but does not actually argue, that FOFs 48-51, 
60-61, 77, and 79 are clearly erroneous.11 Rather, Pila 'a 400 
maintains that a portion of FOF 63 is clearly erroneous to the
 extent that it is based on FOF 78, and FOF 78 is clearly
 erroneous because it does not accurately reflect O'Hagan's
 
11
 Pila'a 400 also contends that FOF 67 is erroneous. FOF 67 provides: 
67. The ram pump is not able to pump water up to parcel 26
from parcel 25, unless it is fed by water from a higher elevation.
Water drawn from the traditional auwai provides sufficient
elevation, by which gravity, lends enough weight to provide the
pressure needed to pump it to a higher location occupied by the
[the pa hale parcel].
 
(Record reference omitted.) It is unclear why Pila' a 400 contests this FOF,
but we infer that Pila' a 400 objects to the circuit court's characterization
of the auwai as "traditional" insofar as it suggests that Andrade hadrevitalized an ancient and historic source of water. 
16
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
testimony. Pila 'a 400 also argues that FOF 91 is clearly 
erroneous because it misrepresents Lansing's testimony.
(i) O'Hagan's testimony
 
The portion of FOF 63 Pila 'a 400 disputes provides: 
"In order to provide water to this dwelling [on the Banana Patch
 
Kuleana], Andrade, in or around 1975-1976, installed a pipe
 system from the traditional 
'auwai system he restored, and pumped 
it through a pipe system, through the use of a hydraulic ram pump
 (powered by gravity and the weight of falling water)."
 
FOFs 77-79 provide:

 
77. On January 26, 2007, [O'Hagan] testified on
behalf of Pila' a 400. [O'Hagan] testified that the pond
where the manowai[12] exists as part of Andrade's water
system was constructed by Andrade in 1999, when [O'Hagan]
erected his house in the area. 
78. Although [O'Hagan] claims that Andrade
constructed the dam and pond in 1999, [O'Hagan's] testimonyis consistent and corroborates the testimony of Andrade thatthe water system had been in place from the 1970's. In the late 1970's, O'Hagan testified that he was on the BananaPatch [K]uleana and observed that a ram[] pump was in placeon the [the lo' i parcel] and was connected to a pipe which
carried water through [the lo' i parcel], and then from [the
lo'i parcel] up to [the pa hale parcel]. In addition,
[O'Hagan] testified that the pump was fed with water from anarea higher in elevation, upstream from the lo' i parcel,
where he observed a large old cement brim used for acesspool. Water would come up from the ground like anartesian well, an apparatus would catch the water, and thenit would flow down to the lo' i parcel. 
79. [O'Hagan's] testimony is also consistent with
Andrade's testimony that the manowai and dam had to be
restored and redredged through the years due to various
adverse factors. 
(Record references omitted.)
 
On appeal, Pila 'a 400 argues that FOF 78 is clearly 
erroneous because O'Hagan 
did not testify that he observed at the time the O'Hagan
Pond[13]
 or dam located on Pila' a 400 Property at issue in
this case. Rather, [O'Hagan] unequivocally testified thatthe O'Hagan pond and the water diversion and delivery system 
12
 At the evidentiary hearing, Andrade testified that a "manowai" is a
dam.
13
 In its memorandum in opposition to Andrade's Preliminary Injunction
Motion, Pila' a 400 argued that Andrade did not actually construct his water
system until 1999, when he created a pond on Pila' a 400 property (the "O'Hagan
Area Pond") and installed an elaborate water diversion system that ran fromthe O'Hagan Area Pond to the lo' i parcel and the pa hale parcel. 
17
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
that transported water to the lo' i parcel were created in or
about 1999. He further stated that when he observed the ram 
pump in 1979, it was not getting water from the waterdiversion system at issue here. 
(Emphasis in original; record references omitted.) 
At the evidentiary hearing, Andrade testified that when 
he moved onto his property in or around 1975 or 1976, he 
discovered the remnants of a traditional auwai system that ran water from Wailoli Stream to the lo
'i parcel for taro farming. 
Andrade restored the po 'ai14 and manowai and installed a pipeline 
in the auwai. He then ran the pipes uphill from the lo 'i parcel 
to the pa hale parcel and pumped water up to his house using a hydraulic ram pump. At one time, O'Hagan lived on Pila
'a 400's 
property, 150 or 200 yards upstream of the Banana Patch Kuleana, twenty or thirty yards away from Wailoli Stream, and about twenty yards upstream of the manowai and po
'ai. When Andrade was asked 
on cross-examination if there was a pond in the area of O'Hagan's house, Andrade testified that when the stream water backed up behind the manowai, it expanded and formed a pond, or reservoir, there. Over the years, Andrade had cleaned out the pond several times, using a backhoe. He had taken soil that filled up in the stream and used it to build and maintain the manowai. 
O'Hagan testified that he lived on Pila
'a 400 Property 
for about twenty-three years, beginning in 1969. In 1979, Andrade caught water from something like an artesian well that brought the water up into a "cement type brim like you use for a cesspool." Andrade had made some type of apparatus to catch the water and take it across Pila
'a 400's Property. O'Hagan observed 
a pipe that ran stream water through a ram pump located on the edge of Pila
'a 400's Property and Andrade's Property onto 
Andrade's Property and to Andrade's house and lo 'i parcel. 
Andrade also obtained water for his house via a catchment system 
14
 Andrade testified that a "po' ai" is an "intake," "depression in the
ground in the bank of the stream," and "the head waters or the initial place
where the water begins to flow into." He testified that when water backed upbehind the manowai, the po' ai diverted the overflow into the auwai, which then
carried the water to the lo' i parcel. 
18
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
attached to the roof of his house. After 1982, O'Hagan moved off 
of Pila 'a 400's Property for about three or four years. 
O'Hagan testified that in about 1999, he moved back 
onto Pila 'a 400's Property, near a little stream by Andrade's 
house in the pa hale parcel. O'Hagan did not see a pond or dam near Andrade's house. Two or three months after O'Hagan moved back, Andrade dug a pond in front of O'Hagan's house using a backhoe. There was a pipe in the pond. Prior to 1999, O'Hagan had been on the lo
'i parcel and had not seen a water system there 
similar to the one Andrade built in 1999. 
FOF 78 is not clearly erroneous. Based on FOF 78 and 
O'Hagan's testimony, the circuit court could have reasonably and rationally determined that O'Hagan's observations actually supported Andrade's testimony. "It is well settled that the . . . the trier of fact[] is free to make all reasonable and rational inferences under the facts in evidence." Estate of Klink ex rel. 
Klink v. State, 113 Hawai
'i 332, 352, 152 P.3d 504, 524 (2007) 
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Further, to the extent the circuit court discredited Andrade's conclusion that the water system was created in 1999, it is well-settled that "the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony are within the province of the trier of fact and, generally, will not be disturbed on appeal." Tamashiro v. 
Control Specialist, Inc., 97 Hawai
'i 86, 92, 34 P.3d 16, 22 
(2001). 
(ii) Lansing's testimony
 
FOFs 89-91 provide:
 
89. On March 2, 2007, [Lansing] testified as a
rebuttal witness for Andrade to refute the testimony of
[O'Hagan] and [Rosa]. [Lansing] represented that he is the
owner of an excavation company. He also stated that he was
 an acquaintance of Andrade, occasionally seeing him while
surfing, and was not being paid by Andrade to testify.
 
90. [Lansing] testified that he met Andrade sometime
in 1978 while surfing and was asked by Andrade to perform
some work on Andrade's water system which provided water to
the Banana Patch [K]uleana. [Lansing] further testified
that the work he performed for Andrade was sometime around
1979-1980.
 
91. [Lansing's] testimony corroborates and supports
the testimony of Andrade that the water system was restored,
maintained, and in existence in the late 1970's. [Lansing]
 
19
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
identified Andrade's Exhibits 1-I and 1-E, as the pond he
worked on. [Lansing] testified that the pond was in
existence at the time he entered the property, and he took a
crawler loader to dig out debris and silt from it. In
 addition, [Lansing] also observed a ram pump which took
water through a pipe and transferred it to a little cottage
where Andrade and his family were residing. [Lansing]
further testified that the ram pump was less than a football
field away from the pond he worked on and that there was a
pipe from the dam in the pond that headed downward towards
the ram pump.
 
(Record references omitted.) 
Pila'a 400 argues that FOF 91 is clearly erroneous 
because (1) Lansing worked on the "Ram Pump Pond," which was the 
only one he saw that day; (2) at the evidentiary hearing, Lansing testified that Exhibit 1-E depicted a picture of "the O'Hagan Pond," but then testified that the pipe in the pond he had worked on was horizontal, not vertical like the one depicted in the exhibit; and (3) Lansing admitted on cross-examination that he was unsure that the pond shown in Exhibit 1-E was the one he dredged. 
At the evidentiary hearing, Lansing testified that he 
did work in Pila
'a for Andrade in 1979 or 1980. Andrade asked 
him to remove silt from a pond. Lansing could not testify regarding whose property the pond was on. Andrade showed Lansing a ram pump, which transferred water to a little cottage in which Andrade was staying. Lansing cleared out an inlet and some lantana "growing on the driveway to the pump and around his house." When Lansing dredged the inlet, he noticed a three- or four-inch pipe, which he saw "headed towards the ram pump." Andrade's counsel showed Lansing Andrade's Exhibits 1I and 1E, which Lansing stated accurately depicted the pond that he worked on, with one difference –- Exhibit 1E depicted the pipe coming into the pond vertically, whereas it actually "came into the pond horizontally." 
On cross-examination, Lansing testified that he thought 
the pond he worked on was less than a football field away from the ram pump. When Pila
'a 400's counsel asked Lansing "[b]ut 
you're not sure, right?" if the pond depicted in Exhibit 1I was the one he had worked on, Lansing responded "[t]hat's true -– 30 years." When asked if the pipe in the pond was horizontally 
20
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
placed at the time he worked on the pond, Lansing responded, "At
 
that time I believe it was" and agreed that Andrade "might have
 done a lot of things," including taking "off an end fitting or
 something."
 
The circuit court's findings in FOF 91 are not clearly
 
erroneous. Lansing testified that although the pipe as depicted
 in Exhibit 1E came into the pond vertically, rather than
 horizontally as he remembered, it was possible that Andrade had
 altered the pipe since Lansing worked on the pond. Further,
 although Lansing testified that he was not "sure" that the pond
 depicted in Exhibit 1I was the one he worked on because it had
 been thirty years since he did the work, the finding that Lansing
 "identified" the pond as the one he worked on was not clearly
 erroneous because he testified that he thought it was the same
 pond.
 
b. Water to pa hale parcel 
Alternatively, Pila
'a 400 contends that even if Andrade 
established appurtenant water rights to the lo 'i parcel, 
Andrade's rights do not extend to the pa hale parcel because
 
Andrade does not purport to allege that his ram pump
approximates an ancient mechanical device that historically
pumped water from the lo� i parcel to the pa hale parcel to
prove water for a dwelling. Nor does Andrade assert that 
there was an ancient pipe system that historically provided
the pa hale parcel with a source of water. In fact, Andrade
testified that there was no water source of the pa hale 
parcel when he first entered upon the kuleana in or about1975. 
(Emphasis in original.)
 
The circuit court concluded that the Banana Patch
 
Kuleana enjoyed appurtenant water rights for domestic use. In
 
COL 58, under the heading "Appurtenant Water Rights," the circuit
 court concluded that "Andrade, through this traditional water
 system, is entitled to an appurtenant right to provide water to
 his kuleana for agricultural and domestic purposes." The circuit
 court does not specifically mention Andrade's right to water for
 
21
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
15
domestic use under the headings "Riparian Water Rights" o r
"Traditional and Customary Water Rights."16
 
The circuit court granted Andrade's Preliminary
 
Injunction Motion, permanently enjoining and restraining Pila 'a 
400 from interfering with, dismantling, damaging, and/or
 destroying Andrade's water system that delivers water to the lo
'i 
and pa hale parcels.
 
HRS § 7-1 provides in relevant part: "The people shall
 
also have a right to drinking water, and running water . . . . 
The springs of water . . . [and] running water . . . shall be
 free to all, on all lands granted in fee simple; provided that
 this shall not be applicable to wells and watercourses, which
 individuals have made for their own use."
 
In 
In re Water Use Permit Applications, 94 Hawai 'i 97, 
137, 9 P.3d 409, 449 (2000) (internal quotation marks and
 citations omitted), the Hawai
'i Supreme Court stated: 
Whether under riparian or prior appropriation systems,
common law or statute, states have uniformly recognized
domestic uses, particularly drinking, as among the highest
uses of water resources. This jurisdiction presents no
exception. In granting individuals fee simple title to land
in the Kuleana Act, the kingdom expressly guaranteed: "The
 people shall . . . have a right to drinking water, and
running water . . . ." And although this provision and
others, including the reservation of sovereign prerogatives,
evidently originated out of concern for the rights of native
tenants in particular[.]
 
. . . [R]eview of the early law of the kingdom reveals
the specific objective of preserving the rights of native
tenants during the transition to a western system of private
property. Before the M� hele, the law "Respecting Water for
Irrigation" assured native tenants "their equal proportion"
of water. Subsequently, the aforementioned Kuleana Act
provision ensured tenants' rights to essential incidents of
land beyond their own kuleana, including water, in
recognition that a little bit of land even with allodial
 
15
 Under this heading, the circuit court concluded that "Andrade is
. . . entitled to use the waters of Wailoli Stream for the cultivation of his
 riparian lands at a quantity and flow that approximates that which was
historically used to cultivate taro and other crops on the Banana Patch
[K]uleana."
16
 Under this heading, the circuit court concluded that "Andrade,
though the use of his traditional water system, enjoys native Hawaiian
traditional and customary rights protected under the Hawaii State Constitution
and the [HRS]" and "[s]ince Andrade exercises his traditional and customary
rights through the use of this traditional water system he need not retain a
permit pursuant to HRS § 174C-101(c)[.]"
 
22
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
title, if they be cut off from all other privileges would be
of very little value[.]
 
In Territory of Hawaii v. Gay, 31 Haw. 376 (Haw. Terr.
 
1930), the Supreme Court of the Territory of Hawai 'i stated: 
Whenever it has appeared that a kuleana or perhaps other
piece of land was, immediately prior to the grant of an
award by the land commission, enjoying the use of water for
the cultivation of taro or for garden purposes or for
domestic purposes, that land has been held to have had
appurtenant to it the right to use the quantity of water
which it had been customarily using at the time named. In
 some instances a mere reference to the land in the award or
 in the records of the land commission as "taro land" ("aina
kalo" or "loi kalo") or as "cultivated land" ("aina mahi")
has sufficed to lead to and to support an adjudication that
that land was entitled to use water for agricultural
purposes. Sometimes the testimony of witnesses who appeared
before the land commission in the hearings leading up to the
award that the land was taro land or cultivated land, or
other statements substantially to that effect, have sufficed
to support a similar adjudication.
 
Id. at 383 (emphases added). The supreme court further stated
 
that
 
[i]f any of the lands were entitled to water by immemorial
usage, this right was included in the conveyance as an
appurtenance. An easement appurtenant to land will pass by
a grant of the land, without mention being made of the
easement or the appurtenances. But if lands had no such
 rights, and no additional grant of water rights was made, it
certainly could take nothing by having been a portion of the
ahupuaa.
 
Id. at 386.
 
"[A]ppurtenant water rights are rights to the use of
 
water utilized by parcels of land at the time of their original
 
conversion into fee simple land." Reppun v. Bd. of Water Supply,
 65 Haw. 531, 551, 656 P.2d 57, 71 (1982), declined to follow on
 other grounds by In re Water Use Applications, supra. "[T]he use
 of water acquired as appurtenant rights may only be used in
 connection with that particular parcel of land to which the right
 is appurtenant[.]" McBryde Sugar Co. v. Robinson, 54 Haw. 174,
 191, 504 P.2d 1330, 1341 (1973).
 
The circuit court's conclusion that Andrade had
 
appurtenant water rights for domestic use was based in part on
 COL 50, which provides that
 
water used for domestic purposes on kuleana lands has
clearly been protected as an appurtenant water right. Gay,
31 Haw. at 395-396 (finding that water for domestic purposes
for every kuleana was assured under Hawaiian law, and that
if it was demonstrated that people dwelt, at the time of the
 
23

land commission award, on the kuleana, it would be easily
found that appurtenant rights for domestic uses would attach
to the kuleana.)
 
The portion of Gay to which the court cited in COL 50 provides:
 
Water for domestic purposes on a lower ahupuaa is in
any event assured under Hawaiian law. Every portion of
land, large or small, ahupuaa, ili or kuleana, upon which
people dwelt was, under the ancient Hawaiian system whose
retention should, in my opinion, continue unqualifiedly,
entitled to drinking water for its human occupants and for
their animals and was entitled to water for other domestic
 purposes. At no time in Hawaii's judicial history has this
been denied. Whenever it is proven that people dwelt, at
the time of the award of the land commission, upon a piece
of land awarded, it will be easily found and adjudicated
that that piece of land was and is entitled to water for all
domestic purposes. Under similar circumstances lands of the
 king or of any other konohiki which have remained unawarded
would be similarly treated. These rights to water for
drinking purposes and for other domestic uses are included
in the ancient appurtenant rights hereinabove referred to. 
Gay, 31 Haw. at 395 (emphases added).
 
In FOFs 39-41, which Pila 'a 400 does not dispute, the 
circuit court found:
 
39. Andrade's Exhibit 3 is a Land Comission Award
 
6640 for the Banana Patch Kuleana comprised of two parcels.
Apana 1 was used for taro cultivation and Apana 2 was used
for a house lot.
 
40. Andrade's Exhibit 4 contains the Native Register
for Land Commission Award 6640, which confirms that Nika,the original claimant for this kuleana, testified that itwas comprised of six taro lo' i and a house lot. 
41. Andrade's Exhibit 4 also contains Foreign and
Native Testimony which corroborates Nika's claim of six tarolo'i and a house lot. 
(Record references omitted.) The circuit court's findings are
 
based on and accurately reflect Andrade's testimony at the
 evidentiary hearing. The Supreme Court has held that "findings
 of fact . . . that are not challenged on appeal are binding on
 the appellate court." Bremer v. Weeks, 104 Hawai
'i 43, 63, 85 
P.3d 150, 170 (2004) (internal quotation marks, citation, and
 brackets). Andrade also testified that the presence of a house
 lot on the kuleana indicates that water was used for domestic
 purposes there: "People have to wash and bathe and do all the
 things they do at home with water." The circuit court's findings
 are also based on and accurately reflect the testimony of Teresa
 Marie Gomes (Gomes), a title and genealogy researcher at Native
 
24

   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawaiian Legal Corporation. The parties stipulated and the court
 
qualified Gomes to testify as an expert in Hawaiian land title. 
Gomes testified that she researched records related to Andrade's
 property, and the Land Commission Award 6640 indicated that the
 "Nika" lot included a house lot.
 
Given the testimony of Andrade and Gomes, the circuit
 
court did not err in finding that the Banana Patch Kuleana has
 appurtenant water rights for domestic use.
 
c. Result
 
The circuit court did not err by finding that the
 
Banana Patch Kuleana has appurtenant water rights; FOFs 48-51,
 60-61, 63 (part), 67, 77-79, 91 are not clearly erroneous; and
 COLs 54-59 are not wrong.
2. Riparian water rights to pa hale parcel 
Pila
'a 400 argues that the circuit court erred in 
ruling that the pa hale parcel of the Banana Patch Kuleana has riparian water rights because the parcel does not adjoin a natural water course. Related to this argument is Pila
'a 400's 
contention that COLs 32-42 are wrong. As we have stated, the circuit court found that the Banana Patch Kuleana's rights to domestic water are appurtenant, not riparian. See Part III.B.1.b. Given our holding that the circuit court did not err
 
by finding that the Banana Patch Kuleana has appurtenant water
 rights for domestic use, we need not address this point.
3. Permit
 
Pila
'a argues that the circuit court erred in ruling 
that Andrade was entitled to maintain and operate his water system without permit for the system, which is required by HRS Chapter 174C ("State Water Code"), specifically HRS §§ 174C-3 (1993), 174C-91 (1993), 174C-92 (1993), and 174C-93 (1993). Related to this argument is Pila
'a 400's contention that FOF 70 
is clearly erroneous and COLs 60-61 are wrong. 
Section 174C-3 defines "stream diversion" as "the act
 
of removing water from a stream into a channel, pipeline, or
 other conduit." Section 174C-91 defines "stream diversion works"
 as "any artificial or natural structure emplaced within the
 
25
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
stream for the purpose of diverting stream water." Section 174C­
92 provides in relevant part that "[a]ny person owning or
 operating a stream diversion works within or outside of a water
 management area shall register such work with the commission." 
Section 174C-93 states in relevant part that "[n]o person shall
 construct or alter a stream diversion works, other than in the
 course of normal maintenance, without first obtaining a permit
 from the commission." On appeal, Pila
'a 400 argues that Andrade 
is required to obtain a permit for his water system because it
 constitutes "stream diversion works."
 
In FOFs 69 and 70, the circuit court found:

 
69. Pursuant to the enactment of the State of Hawaii 
Water Code, Andrade in 1989 registered the Banana Patch
[K]uleana lo' i and domestic water source and declared his 
resulting water use with the Commission on Water ResourceManagement. 
70. Traditional uses of water for domestic uses and 
taro lo' i, however, do not need use permits from the State
of Hawaii Commission on Water Resource Management. 
(Record references omitted.) COLs 60-61 provide:
 
60. Because Andrade enjoys appurtenant water rights
to the Banana Patch [K]uleana through his traditional water
system, he need not retain a permit for such use pursuant to
HRS § 174C-101(d) which provides:
 
The appurtenant water rights of kuleana and taro
lands, along with those traditional and customary
rights assured in this section, shall not be
diminished or extinguished by a failure to apply for
or to receive a permit under this chapter.
 
61. Also, Andrade is accessing water through his
system for domestic purposes, he is further exempted by HRS
§ 174C-48, which states, in pertinent part:
 
(a)	 No person shall make any withdrawal, diversion,
impoundment or consumptive use of water in any
designated water management area without first
obtaining a permit from the commission.
However, no permit shall be required for
 
domestic consumption of water by individual
 users, and no permit shall be required for the
 use of a catchment system to gather water.
 
(emphasis added)
 
62. "Domestic use" under the State Water Code is
 
defined as "any use of water for individual personal needs
and for household purposes such as drinking, bathing,
heating, cooking, noncommercial gardening, and sanitation."
HRS § 174-3.
 
26
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
HRS § 174C-101(d) (1993) provides that "[t]he
 
appurtenant water rights of kuleana and taro lands, along with 
those traditional and customary rights assured in this section, shall not be diminished or extinguished by a failure to apply for or to receive a permit under this chapter." HRS § 174C-48 (1993) provides in part that "no permit shall be required for domestic consumption of water by individual users." As we have already discussed, the circuit court did not err by finding that the Banana Patch Kuleana has an appurtenant right to water for domestic purposes and Pila
'a 400 does not contest the court's 
finding that Andrade has an appurtenant right to water for agricultural uses. See Part III.B.1. Pursuant to the plain language of HRS § 174C-101(d), Andrade is not required to obtain a permit for his water system. FOF 70 is not clearly erroneous and COLs 60-61 are not wrong.
4. Native Hawaiian rights

 
Pila'a 400 argues that the circuit court erred by 
basing its decision on Andrade's water rights as a Native
 Hawaiian, but depriving Pila
'a 400 of the opportunity to address 
the matter:
 
Although Andrade's first counterclaim alleges a violation of
traditional and customary Native Hawaiian rights, Andrade
never requested summary judgment on this claim in 2006 or
2007. To the extent that Andrade's [MSJ] dated June 22,
2006, can be construed as requesting summary judgment on
this claim, such request was nevertheless denied by the
court's [Order Grant/Deny Andrade's MSJ], which granted in
part Andrade's [MSJ] with respect to an unrelated claim, but
denied Andrade's [MSJ] with respect to all of the remaining
claims in the Complaint and Counterclaim. Moreover, as
discussed above, the evidentiary hearing . . . was expressly
limited to exclude discussion of Native Hawaiian rights.
 
(Internal quotation marks, record references, brackets, and 
footnote omitted; emphasis in original.) In a footnote, Pila 'a 
400 maintains that Andrade first requested summary judgment on a violation of traditional and customary Native Hawaiian rights on April 2, 2008. Related to this argument is Pila
'a 400's 
contention that FOFs 43-44 are clearly erroneous and COLs 63-75 are wrong. 
Pila
'a 400 apparently refers to the portion of the 
FOF/COL/Order under the heading, "Traditional and Customary Water 
27
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Rights." In that section, the circuit court refers to Andrade's
 
enjoyment of Native Hawaiian traditional and customary rights
 protected under article XII, section 7 of the Hawai
'i 
Constitution and HRS § 1-1 to support the court's finding in COL
 73 that "[s]ince Andrade exercises his traditional and customary
 rights through the use of this traditional water system he need
 not retain a permit pursuant to HRS § 174C-101(c)." HRS § 174C­101(c) (1993) provides:
 
§174C-101 Native Hawaiian water rights.
. . . . 
(c) Traditional and customary rights of ahupua' a 
tenants who are descendants of native Hawaiians who 
inhabited the Hawaiian Islands prior to 1778 shall not beabridged or denied by this chapter. Such traditional and customary rights shall include, but not be limited to, thecultivation or propagation of taro on one's own kuleana andthe gathering of hihiwai, opae, o' opu, limu, thatch, ti
leaf, aho cord, and medicinal plants for subsistence,cultural, and religious purposes. 
COL 73 is based in part on FOFs 43-44, which provide:
 
43. As a native Hawaiian, Andrade engages in various
traditional and customary practices in the ahupua' a of Pila' a 
and more generally on the island of Kauai. More specifically, Andrade is a practioner of mahi' ai, meaning
cultivator of the soil, and cultivates taro and other typesof agriculture. In addition, Andrade considers himself andis in fact, as a result of his long tenancy in Pila' a, a
hoa�aina, meaning companion or caretaker of the land. 
44. Through the cultivation of taro, Andrade engages
in a native Hawaiian traditional and customary practice.
Taro is considered to be the elder sibling of the Hawaiian
people and one of the mainstays of Hawaiian cultivators.
 
(Record references omitted.)
 
Because, as we have already held, Andrade is not
 
required to obtain a permit for his water system, we need not
 
address this point. FOFs 43-44 are not clearly erroneous and
 COLs 63-75 are not wrong.
5. Andrade's request inadequate
 
Pila
'a 400 argues that insofar as the order granting 
Andrade's Preliminary Injunction Motion constitutes a permanent
 injunction, the circuit court exceeded its authority because
 Andrade's two-page request in Andrade's MSJ failed to adequately
 request the order. Pila
'a 400 cites to the standard set forth in 
Office of Hawaiian Affairs v. Housing & Community Development
 
28

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Corp. of Hawaii, 117 Hawai 'i 174, 212, 177 P.3d 884, 922 (2008): 
"[T]he appropriate test in this jurisdiction for determining 
whether a permanent injunction is proper is: (1) whether the plaintiff has prevailed on the merits; (2) whether the balance of irreparable damage favors the issuance of a permanent injunction; and (3) whether the public interest supports granting such an injunction." 
In Andrade's Preliminary Injunction Motion, Andrade 
cited to and provided arguments for each of the factors in the above standard. Andrade devoted about two pages applying the first factor, a little over one page applying the second factor, and about a half page applying the third factor. With regard to the first factor, Andrade argued that he was not only clearly likely to succeed on the merits as a kuleana owner entitled to access and water rights, but should succeed.
17 With regard to 
the second factor, Andrade argued that unless Pila 'a 400 was 
restrained and enjoined from preventing Andrade from repairing his water source and water system, Andrade and his son would likely continue to suffer immediate and irreparable harm including de facto evacuation from their home, damage to their crops, loss of peace of mind, and the peaceful, secure, and quiet enjoyment and use of their property. With regard to the third factor, he argued that granting Andrade's Preliminary Injunction Motion would be consistent with the public policy to preserve and protect Native Hawaiian rights to practice their traditions and customs, pursuant to article XII, section 7 of the Hawai
'i 
Constitution and HRS §§ 1-1 and 7-1. Andrade provided legal authority and described the relevant background facts with regard to each element of the standard. 
6. Result
 
The circuit court did not err by granting Andrade's
 
Preliminary Injunction Motion; FOFs 43-44, 48-51, 53-58, 60-61,
 
17
 Andrade did in fact succeed on the merits as a kuleana owner
 
entitled to access and water rights. Although it is not clear when the
circuit court treated Andrade's motion as one for a permanent injunction, the
only explanation is that it was considered along with Andrade's MSJ.
 
29 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
63 (part), 67, 69-70, 76-79, 85-88, and 91 are not clearly
 
erroneous; and COLs 32-42, 54-61, and 63-75 are not wrong.
C. JUDICIAL TAKING
 
Pila'a 400 argues that 
[t]he circuit court's order requiring a recordable easement,
recognizing unlimited water rights and enjoining the removal
of the water diversion and pipe system, pursuant to HRS
section 7-1 and despite the facts of this case, is a
departure from settled law governing kuleana rights and
effects an unconstitutional judicial taking. . . . Here, the
circuit court's order effects a taking because it is not
based upon preexisting principles of state property law, but
is instead a substantial and unsupported departure from
those principles.
 
In Public Access Shoreline Hawaii v. Hawai 'i County 
Planning Comm'n, 79 Hawai 'i 425, 903 P.2d 1246 (1995), cert. 
denied, 517 U.S. 1163, 116 S. Ct. 1559 (1996), the Hawai 'i 

 Supreme Court stated:
Under the judicial taking theory, when a judicial
decision alters property rights, the decision may amount to
an unconstitutional taking of property. However, the
judicial taking theory is by no means a settled issue of
law. Assuming, without deciding, that the theory is viable,
a judicial decision would only constitute an
unconstitutional taking of private property if it involved
retroactive alteration of state law such as would constitute
 an unconstitutional taking of private property.
 
Id. at 451, 903 P.2d at 1272 (internal quotation marks,
 
citations, and brackets omitted).
 
First, as we have already discussed, in this case, the 
circuit court erred by ordering Pila 'a 400 to record the easement 
in Andrade's favor without giving Pila 'a 400 an adequate 
opportunity to respond to Andrade's assertion that he is entitled to a recorded easement. See Part III.A.2.a. Second, the circuit court did not "recognize unlimited water rights" on the part of the Banana Patch Kuleana. As we have discussed, the circuit court concluded that the Banana Patch Kuleana was entitled to "the quantity and flow of water which was [historically] utilized on this parcel to irrigate six taro lo
'i, kula land, land for 
noni, and domestic uses." See Part III.B.1.a. Third, as we have discussed, based on Hawai
'i statutes and case law, the circuit 
court was not wrong to conclude that the Banana Patch Kuleana enjoys appurtenant water rights for domestic purposes in a quantity equivalent to that which was utilized historically. See 
30
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Part III.B. In support of its findings and conclusions on this 
point, the circuit court cites to numerous Hawai 'i cases and 
statutes. On appeal, Pila 'a 400 does not elaborate upon its 
assertion that the circuit court's findings constitute "a substantial and unsupported departure from" "principles of state property law" and we fail to see how that is the case. The circuit court's rulings in this case do not constitute a judicial taking. 
D. ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS
 
Pila
'a 400 argues that the circuit court, in its Order 
Grant/Deny Andrade's Enforce/Contempt Motion, erroneously ordered Pila
'a 400 to pay Andrade's attorneys' fees and costs. In 
Andrade's Enforce/Contempt Motion, Andrade sought an order from the circuit court (1) compelling Pila
'a 400 to comply with the 
portion of the FOF/COL/Order in which the court found and defined an easement by necessity to Andrade's property in favor of Andrade and instructed Pila
'a 400 to execute and record an 
easement to Andrade's property, and (2) finding Pila 'a 400 in 
contempt for its failure to execute and record Andrade's easement to Andrade's property, as required by the FOF/COL/Order. The circuit court ordered Pila
'a 400 to pay Andrade $15,509.29 for 
attorneys' fees and costs he incurred in filing and litigating Andrade's Enforce/Contempt Motion. 
To the extent the circuit court ordered Pila
'a 400 to 
pay Andrade attorneys' fees and costs associated with the portion of Andrade's Enforce/Contempt Motion regarding Pila
'a 400's 
failure to record an easement in Andrade's favor, the court abused its discretion because, as we have already discussed, the court should not have ordered Pila
'a 400 to record the easement. 
See Part III.A. 
With regard to the circuit court's award of attorneys' 
fees in general, Pila 'a 400 argues that there is no authority for 
the court's award and Andrade failed to file a motion for attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(d)(2) or request such in Andrade's Enforce/Contempt Motion. Andrade argues that the circuit court was authorized to award Andrade 
31
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to the court's inherent 
powers. "[A]n award of attorney's fees must be based upon either statute, agreement, stipulation or precedent[.]" LeMay v. 
Leander, 92 Hawai
'i 614, 626, 994 P.2d 546, 558 (2000). HRS 
§ 603-21.9 (1993) provides that "[t]he several circuit courts shall have power . . . (6) [t]o make and award such judgments, decrees, orders, and mandates, issue such executions and other processes, and do such other acts and take such other steps as may be necessary to carry into full effect the powers which are or shall be given to them by law or for the promotion of justice in matters pending before them." In United States v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America, AFL-CIO, 948 F.2d 1338, 1345 (2d Cir. 1991), the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit stated: 
[A] court has a third means at its disposal for sanctioning
improper conduct: its inherent power. This power stems
from the very nature of courts and their need to be able
"'to manage their own affairs so as to achieve the orderly
and expeditious disposition of cases.'" Chambers v. NASCO,
 
Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 111 S. Ct. 2123, 2132, 115 L. Ed. 2d 27
(1991) (quoting Link v. Wabash R.R. Co., 370 U.S. 626, 630­
31, 82 S. Ct. 1386, 1388-89, 8 L. Ed. 2d 734 (1962)). One
 component of a court's inherent power is the power to assess
costs and attorneys' fees against either the client or his
attorney where a party has "'acted in bad faith,
vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons.'" Alyeska
 
Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Soc'y, 421 U.S. 240, 258­
59, 95 S. Ct. 1612, 1622-23, 44 L. Ed. 2d 141 (1975)
(quoting F.D. Rich Co. v. United States ex rel. Industrial
 
Lumber Co., 417 U.S. 116, 129, 94 S. Ct. 2157, 2165, 40 L.
Ed. 2d 703 (1974)). 
"Although the trial court possesses inherent power to do those
 
things necessary for the proper administration of justice, . . . 
because inherent powers are shielded from direct democratic
 controls, they must be exercised with restraint and discretion." 
Kukui Nuts of Hawaii, Inc. v. R. Baird & Co., 6 Haw. App. 431,
 436, 726 P.2d 268, 271-72 (1986) (internal quotation marks,
 citations, and brackets omitted). 
In the instant case, the Order Granting in Part 
Andrade's Enforce/Contempt Motion is in the nature of a civil contempt order, although the circuit court did not find Pila
'a 
400 in contempt or otherwise find that Pila 'a 400 had acted in 
32
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
bad faith. The circuit court provided no legal basis for its 
award of attorneys' fees and costs, and we find none. Given the foregoing, the circuit court abused its discretion when it ordered Pila
'a 400 to pay Andrade $15,509.29 for attorneys' fees 
and costs Andrade had incurred in filing and litigating Andrade's Enforce/Contempt Motion. We need not address Pila
'a 400's 
remaining arguments with regard to this point.18 
E. SANCTION
 
Pila'a 400 argues that the circuit court in its Order 
Grant/Deny Andrade's Enforce/Contempt Motion erroneously imposed a $1000-per-day sanction against Pila
'a 400 because the court 
erroneously required Pila 'a 400 to record the easement. We agree 
to the extent that the circuit court imposed the sanction against Pila
'a 400 for not recording the easement, given our holding that 
the court erred by requiring Pila 'a 400 to record the easement. 
See Part III.A.2.a. 
F. REMAINING POINTS RE FOFs
 
Pila'a 400 claims that FOFs 76 and 85-88 are clearly 
erroneous. However, Pila 'a 400 does not actually argue these 
points, and we therefore decline to address them. See Hawai 'i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(4) and (7) (stating that points not argued may be deemed waived).
IV. CONCLUSION
 
The portions of the "Final Judgment Under Rule 54(b) as 
to the April 12, 2007 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order" filed on January 25, 2008 in the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit ordering Pila
'a 400 to record a "Non Exclusive 
Grant of Easement in favor of [Andrade]" and ordering Pila 'a 400 
to pay Andrade's attorneys' fees and costs incurred in filing and litigating Andrade's July 16, 2007 Motion to Enforce and for Contempt are vacated and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion. The remainder of the "Final Judgment Under Rule
