class I, II or III who works less than a full seven-hour
work day shall be compensated on a pro-rated, hourly basis
as follows:

HRS § 302A-624(e) (Supp. 2006).

 HRS § 302A-624 was further amended in 2008. See 2008 Haw. Sess.
 
L. 187.

In 2007, licensed class II teachers in bargaining unit
 
5 received a 4% pay increase effective as of August 1, 2007. A
 
similar increase was not provided to the Substitute Teachers. 
On August 10, 2007, the Substitute Teachers filed a
 
complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief based on Act
 
263. Upon hearing a motion for class certification, which was
 
granted, and cross-motions for summary judgment, judgment was
 entered in favor of the State and against the Substitute
 
Teachers. A notice of appeal was timely filed.
 
On appeal, the Substitute Teachers raise a single point
 
of error. The Substitute Teachers contend that the Circuit Court
 
erred in granting summary judgment against them and in favor of
 
the State because Act 263 required the DOE to provide them with a
 
raise to match that provided to licensed Class II teachers in
 
bargaining unit 5.
 
The interpretation of a statute is a question of law 
which this court reviews de novo. Kaho
'ohanohano v. Dep't of 
Human Servs., State of Hawai 'i, 117 Hawai 'i 262, 281, 178 P.3d 
538, 557 (2008) (citations omitted). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve the Substitute Teachers' contentions as follows:
 
HRS § 302A-624(e), as amended by Act 263, is plain and
 
unambiguous. It established specific minimum hourly or minimum
 
per diem rates of pay for substitute teachers of between $5.20
 
and $7 a day greater than the previously established rates of
 
pay. HRS § 302A-624(e), as amended by Act 263, contains no
 
language whatsoever linking substitute teacher pay to the pay
 
scale negotiated for full-time teachers. "[W]here the statutory
 
language is plain and unambiguous, our sole duty is to give
 
effect to its plain and obvious meaning." Kaanapali Hillside

Homeowners' Assoc. v. Doran, 114 Hawai 'i 361, 369, 162 P.3d 1277, 
1285 (citation omitted; format altered). 
The Substitute Teachers base their argument on the
 
prefatory or purpose section of Act 263, which provided, in
 
relevant part:
 
The legislature further finds that an increase in
substitute teacher pay will contribute to the provision of
the highest quality teaching and work environment for
Hawaii's substitute teachers and students. The per diem
rate of class I, II, and III teachers are to be adjusted
upward to match the salary or wage increases that are
provided to licensed class II teachers in bargaining unit 5
in the collective bargaining agreement between the Hawaii
State Teachers Association and the department of education.
 
The purpose of this Act is to set and provide moneys
for classification and compensation rates for substitute
teachers that are consistent with the compensation rates
determined by the legislature in 1996.
 
2006 Haw. Sess. L. 263, § 1. 
However, under Hawai 'i law, the purpose section of a 
statutory enactment is not a substantive part of the statute and 
does not create rights that are not found within the operative 
statutory provisions. See Poe v. Haw. Labor Relations Bd., 97 
Hawai'i 528, 540, 40 P.3d 930, 942 (2002); see also Coon v. City 
& County of Honolulu, 98 Hawai 'i 233, 249 P.3d 348, 364 (2002). 
Courts will only consider the purpose section as a guide for determining legislative intent or purpose, when necessary to 
clarify any ambiguities. Poe, 97 Hawai
'i at 540. 40 P.3d at 942. 
As stated above, HRS § 302A-624(e), as amended by Act 263, is plain and unambiguous.
