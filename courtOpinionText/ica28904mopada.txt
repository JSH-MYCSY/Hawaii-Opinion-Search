OF THE STATE OF HAWAI rI 
STATE OF HAWAI rI, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
DANIEL TAYLOR, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 07-1-0253)

 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Daniel Taylor (Taylor) appeals from
 
the "Order Granting Ex Parte Motion to Certify Order Denying
 
Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Indictment and Second Motion to
 
Dismiss for Interlocutory Appeal Pursuant to H.R.S. § 641-17"
 
filed on December 13, 2007 in the Circuit Court of the Third
 
1
Circuit  (circuit court).
On appeal, Taylor contends the circuit court erred in 
denying (1) his Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 701-112 (1993) claim; (2) his double jeopardy claim under the Fifth and 
Fourteenth Amendments to the United Statutes Constitution; (3) 
his double jeopardy claim under article I, section 10 of the 
Hawai
ri Constitution; and (4) his claim that, as a matter of law, 
the artifacts were not "property of another" for purposes of

HRS §§ 708-800 (1993), 708-830(1) (1993), and 708-830.5(1)(a) 
(1993) under theories that the State of Hawai ri (State) had 
presented to the grand jury and the circuit court, and due process thus required dismissal under article I, section 5 of the 
Hawai
ri Constitution and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to 
the United States Constitution. 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On March 24, 2006, the United States of America (the
 
Government) charged Taylor by Information with:
 
Count 1: Conspiracy (18 United States Code (U.S.C.)
 
§ 371) to traffic in Native American cultural items, namely "to
 sell, use for profit, and transport for sale and profit Native
 
American cultural items obtained in violation of the Native
 
American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act" (NAGPRA), in
 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1170(b), "to wit: Native Hawaiian
 
artifacts that had been repatriated and re-buried at Kanupa Cave
 
located on the island of Hawaii," occurring from at least
 
June 16, 2004 through August 2004, and specifying the "ways and
 
means of the conspiracy" and also reflecting certain "overt
 
acts"; and
 
Count 2: Trafficking in Native American cultural items
 
in violation of NAGPRA, "to wit: Native Hawaiian artifacts that
 
had been repatriated and re-buried at Kanupa Cave located on the
 
island of Hawaii," occurring on or about June 17, 2004 -- all in
 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1170(b) and 2 [sic].
 
Pursuant to a Memorandum of Plea Agreement (Plea 
Agreement), Taylor entered a guilty plea on March 24, 2006 to 
Count 1, in exchange for the Government agreeing to dismiss Count 
2 after sentencing and not seek additional charges related to the 
taking and selling of Native American cultural items from about 
June 2004 through August 2004. The Plea Agreement incorporated 
an outline of facts relating to the charge. United States 
District Court for the District of Hawai
ri (District Court) 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI rI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Magistrate Judge Barry M. Kurren found Taylor guilty. On
 
June 12, 2007, then-Magistrate Judge Leslie Kobayashi entered a
 
judgment in which the District Court convicted and sentenced
 
Taylor to, inter alia, an eleven-month prison term.
 
According to the State, it received a copy of the
 
Government's redacted investigative file on October 16, 2006. 
The State Attorney General's office Special Agent Kaikana (Agent
 
Kaikana) interviewed three additional witnesses, whose statements
 
were not included in the Government's file. Agent Kaikana also
 
interviewed Steve Rosen, who provided an appraisal of the
 
artifacts involved in this case.
 
On May 23, 2007, the State presented its case of Theft
 
in the First Degree against Taylor to the grand jury. The
 
evidence included the following. Some of the Hawaiian artifacts
 
in the J.S. Emerson Collection were obtained from Kanupa Cave by
 
Joseph Swift Emerson (Emerson), and Emerson sold part of the
 
artifacts to the Bishop Museum and the Peabody Museum. Some of
 
the artifacts were repatriated from the Bishop and Peabody
 
Museums and reburied at Kanupa Cave. It was documented that the
 
State, Hui Malama, Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA), and Bishop
 
Museum brought the artifacts back to Kanupa for repatriation and
 
reburial.
 
Taylor was a suspect in an investigation of theft of
 
Hawaiian artifacts from Kanupa Cave. Taylor's statement in his
 
Plea Agreement included that he went to Kanupa Cave, removed the
 
rock blocking the cave entrance, went inside, saw a lot of
 
artifacts in woven lauhala baskets and wrapped in black cloth,
 
took about 157 artifacts from the cave, and tried to sell the
 
artifacts. Some of the artifacts had Emerson Collection labels
 
on them, and Taylor acknowledged in the Plea Agreement that he
 
saw Emerson tags on the artifacts; knew the artifacts belonged to
 
the Emerson Collection; and prior to selling the artifacts, he 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI rI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
took off the Emerson tags. Taylor stated that he attempted to
 
sell or did sell some of the artifacts. As a result of the
 
execution of a search warrant at Taylor's residence, two pieces
 
of a sled runner that had been part of the Peabody Museum's
 
collection of artifacts were recovered.
 
On May 24, 2007, the State filed an indictment,
 
charging Taylor with Theft in the First Degree, in violation of
 
HRS §§ 708-830(1) and 708-830.5(1)(a).
 
On July 24, 2007, Taylor moved to dismiss the 
indictment pursuant to HRS §§ 701-110(3) (1993) and 701-112 and 
the Hawai ri Constitution for violations of (1) double jeopardy in 
the State prosecution of an offense for which he had been convicted in federal court and (2) due process under the Hawai
ri 
and United States Constitutions where "property of another" was not established as required under HRS § 708-800 and where the 
control did not constitute theft under HRS §§ 708-830(1) and 
708-830.5(1)(a) (First Motion to Dismiss). On August 24, 2007, 
the State opposed the motion. 
On August 30, 2007, the circuit court held a hearing on
 
the First Motion to Dismiss, ordered the parties to submit
 
supplemental memoranda, and stated that it would render its
 
decision in writing.
 
On September 13, 2007, Taylor filed a Second Motion to
 
Dismiss (Second Motion to Dismiss), arguing that a conviction for
 
the Theft in the First Degree charge would violate the rule under
 
State v. Modica, 58 Haw. 249, 250-51, 567 P.2d 420, 421-22
 
(1977), where the first degree theft class B felony offense is
 
also punishable as a petty misdemeanor under HRS §§ 6D-2(a) (2009
 
Repl.) and 6D-12 (2009 Repl.). In a September 12, 2007
 
supplemental memorandum in opposition to the First Motion to
 
Dismiss, the State argued that the stolen artifacts were the
 
property of the State, referencing HRS § 6E-7 (2009 Repl.) (State
 
title to historic property) and § 6E-2 (2009 Repl.) (definition
 
of historic property).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI rI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On November 14, 2007, the circuit court entered its
 
"Findings of Facts, Conclusions of Law and Order Denying Motion
 
to Dismiss Indictment [First Motion to Dismiss] and Second Motion
 
to Dismiss" (FOF/COL/Order). On December 13, 2007, Taylor
 
obtained an order from the circuit court certifying an
 
interlocutory appeal from the FOF/COL/Order. Taylor filed his
 
notice of appeal on December 14, 2007.
 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
A. MOTION TO DISMISS INDICTMENT
 
A denial of a motion to dismiss an indictment based 
upon a statute regarding limitations on prosecution is reviewed 
for abuse of discretion. State v. Akau, 118 Hawai ri 44, 51, 185 
P.3d 229, 236 (2008). 
B. INTERPRETATION OF A STATUTE
 
Interpretation of a statute is reviewed de novo. Id. 
C. MOTION TO DISMISS
 
A motion to dismiss based upon constitutional double 
jeopardy is reviewed de novo under the right/wrong standard. 
Whiting v. State, 88 Hawai ri 356, 358, 966 P.2d 1082, 1084 
(1998); State v. Ferm, 94 Hawai ri 17, 22, 7 P.3d 193, 198 (App. 
2000); State v. Hoang, 86 Hawai ri 48, 50-51, 947 P.2d 360, 362-63 
(1997) (grant of motion to dismiss a count of the indictment for violation of due process and equal protection based upon the 
Modica rule was reviewed de novo). 
D. FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
 
Pretrial findings of fact are reviewed under the 
clearly erroneous standard. State v. Locquiao, 100 Hawai
ri 195, 
203, 58 P.3d 1242, 1250 (2002). Pretrial conclusions of law are reviewed under the de novo standard. Id. 
III. DISCUSSION
 
A. FIRST MOTION TO DISMISS PURSUANT TO HRS § 701-112
 
Taylor contends the circuit court erred when it denied
 
the HRS § 701-112 claim he raised in his First Motion to Dismiss.
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI rI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
He argues that the circuit court wrongly concluded that the
 
charged state offense of Theft in the First Degree required proof
 
of facts that the federal offense of conspiracy to traffic in
 
Native Hawaiian artifacts did not.
 
HRS § 701-112 provides, in relevant part:
 
§701-112 Former prosecution in another jurisdiction;
when a bar.  When behavior constitutes an offense within the
 
concurrent jurisdiction of this State and of the United
States or another state, a prosecution in any such other
jurisdiction is a bar to a subsequent prosecution in this
State under any of the following circumstances:
 
(1)	 The first prosecution resulted in . . . a
conviction as defined in section 701-110(3), and
the subsequent prosecution is based on the same
conduct, unless:
 
(a)	 The offense for which the defendant is
 
subsequently prosecuted requires proof of
a fact not required by the former offense
and the law defining each of the offenses
is intended to prevent a substantially
different harm or evil[.]
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
In the instant case, Theft in the First Degree requires
 
proof of the facts that the item taken had a value of over
 
$20,000 and the person intended to deprive the owner of the
 
property. HRS § 708-830.5(1)(a) & 708-830(1). These facts were
 
not required for the federal conspiracy and trafficking offenses. 
The federal conspiracy and trafficking offenses appear
 
to be intended to prevent substantially different harms or evils
 
than the state theft offense. With regard to the purpose of the
 
conspiracy statute:
 
Our decisions have identified two independent values served
by the law of conspiracy. The first is protection of
society from the dangers of concerted criminal activity,
Callanan v. United States, [364 U.S. 587, 593, 81 S. Ct.
321, 325 (1961)]; Dennis v. United States, 341 U.S. 494,
573-574, 71 S. Ct. 857, 899-900, 95 L. Ed. 1137 (1951)
(Jackson, J., concurring).
 
The second aspect is that conspiracy is an inchoate
crime. This is to say, that, although the law generally
makes criminal only antisocial conduct, at some point in the
continuum between preparation and consummation, the
likelihood of a commission of an act is sufficiently great
and the criminal intent sufficiently well formed to justify
the intervention of the criminal law. See Note,
 
Developments in the Law-Criminal Conspiracy, 72 Harv. L.
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI rI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Rev., at 923-925. The law of conspiracy identifies the
agreement to engage in a criminal venture as an event of
sufficient threat to social order to permit the imposition
of criminal sanctions for the agreement alone, plus an overt
act in pursuit of it, regardless of whether the crime agreed
upon actually is committed. United States v. Bayer, 331
U.S. 532, 542, 67 S. Ct. 1394, 1399, 91 L. Ed. 1654 (1947).
Criminal intent has crystallized, and the likelihood of
actual, fulfilled commission warrants preventive action.
 
United States v. Feola, 420 U.S. 671, 693-94, 95 S. Ct. 1255,
 
1268 (1975). With regard to the purpose of the trafficking
 
offense:
 
The primary purpose of NAGPRA, which is to assist
Native Americans in the repatriation of items that the
tribes consider sacred, differs from that of the Antiquities
Act, which is directed against the unlawful taking or
destruction of property. Because the intended purposes of
the two acts differ significantly, they should not be
treated similarly for sentencing calculations.
 
United States v. Corrow, 941 F. Supp. 1553, 1567 (D.N.M. 1996),
 
aff'd 119 F.3d 796 (10th Cir. 1997), cert. denied 522 U.S. 1133
 
(1998).
 
Thus, the primary purposes of the conspiracy statute
 
and NAGPRA are different from the primary purpose of the state
 
theft statute, which is concerned with "protecting owners from
 
the deprivation of their property." State v. Freeman, 70 Haw.
 
434, 439, 774 P.2d 888, 892 (1989) (see Commentary to HRS §§
 708-830 to -833). Furthermore, as discussed previously, NAGPRA
 
provided a savings provision that explicitly expressed no intent
 
to limit the application of any state or federal law pertaining
 
to theft. H.R. Rep. 101-877 (1990), reprinted in 1990
 
U.S.C.C.A.N. 4367, 1990 WL 200613.
 
Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in its
 
conclusions and did not abuse its discretion in denying the First
 
Motion to Dismiss in which the HRS § 701-112 claim was made.
 
B.	 DOUBLE JEOPARDY UNDER THE FIFTH AND FOURTEENTH
 
AMENDMENTS TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION
 
Taylor contends the circuit court erred when it denied
 
his double jeopardy claim made pursuant to the Fifth and
 
Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI rI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution,
 
made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment,
 
states in relevant part: "nor shall any person be subject for
 
the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb."
 
The dual sovereignty doctrine is founded on the
common-law conception of crime as an offense against the
sovereignty of the government. When a defendant in a single
act violates the "peace and dignity" of two sovereigns by
breaking the laws of each, he has committed two distinct
"offences." United States v. Lanza, 260 U.S. 377, 382, 43
S. Ct. 141, 67 L. Ed. 314 (1922). As the Court explained in
Moore v. Illinois, 14 How. 13, 19, 14 L. Ed. 306 (1852),
"[a]n offence, in its legal signification, means the
transgression of a law." Consequently, when the same act
transgresses the laws of two sovereigns, "it cannot be truly
averred that the offender has been twice punished for the
same offence; but only that by one act he has committed two
offences, for each of which he is justly punishable." Id.,
at 20.
 
In applying the dual sovereignty doctrine, then, the
crucial determination is whether the two entities that seek
 
successively to prosecute a defendant for the same course of
conduct can be termed separate sovereigns. This
 determination turns on whether the two entities draw their
 authority to punish the offender from distinct sources of
 
power. See, e.g., United States v. Wheeler, 435 U.S. 313,
 
320, 98 S. Ct. 1079, 1084, 55 L. Ed. 2d 303 (1978); Waller
 v. Florida, 397 U.S. 387, 393, 90 S. Ct. 1184, 1187, 25 L.
 Ed. 2d 435 (1970); Puerto Rico v. Shell Co., 302 U.S. 253,
 264-265, 58 S. Ct. 167, 172-73, 82 L. Ed. 235 (1937); Lanza,
 supra, 260 U.S., at 382, 43 S. Ct., at 142; Grafton v.
 United States, 206 U.S. 333, 354-355, 27 S. Ct. 749, 755, 51
L. Ed. 1084 (1907). Thus, the Court has uniformly held that
the States are separate sovereigns with respect to the
Federal Government because each State's power to prosecute
is derived from its own "inherent sovereignty," not from the
Federal Government. Wheeler, supra, at 320, n.14, 98 S.
 
Ct., at 1084, n.14. See Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S.
187, 193-194, 79 S. Ct. 666, 669-70, 3 L. Ed. 2d 729 (1959)
(collecting cases); Lanza, supra. As stated in Lanza,
 supra, 260 U.S., at 382, 43 S. Ct., at 142:
 
"[E]ach government in determining what shall be an

offense against its peace and dignity is exercising
its own sovereignty, not that of the other.
 
"It follows that an act denounced as a crime by both
national and state sovereignties is an offense against
the peace and dignity of both and may be punished by
each."
 
See also Bartkus v. Illinois, 359 U.S. 121, 79 S. Ct. 676, 3
 
L. Ed. 2d 684 (1959); Westfall v. United States, 274 U.S.
256, 258, 47 S. Ct. 629, 629, 71 L. Ed. 1036 (1927) (Holmes,
J.) (the proposition that the State and Federal Governments
may punish the same conduct "is too plain to need more than
statement").
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI rI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Heath v. Alabama, 474 U.S. 82, 88-89, 106 S. Ct. 433, 437-38
 
(1985). Under the United States Constitution, dual sovereignty
 
exists, and because the same conduct may be punished by the
 
Government as well as by the State, Taylor may be prosecuted for
 
the state theft offense unless an exception to dual sovereignty
 
applies.
 
[The] separate-sovereigns rule has one important
exception, however. In Bartkus, the Supreme Court suggested
that the Double Jeopardy Clause might proscribe consecutive
state and federal prosecutions in cases where federal
authorities commandeer a state's prosecutorial machinery,
converting the state prosecution into "a sham and a cover
for a federal prosecution, and thereby in essential fact
another federal prosecution." 359 U.S. at 123-24, 79 S. Ct.
676. Although the Court explored this narrow exception in
dicta, we have adopted the "Bartkus exception" as the
controlling law of this circuit. See, e.g., [United States
 
v. Figueroa-Soto, 938 F.2d 1015, 1019 (9th Cir. 1991)];
United States v. Bernhardt, 831 F.2d 181, 182-83 (9th Cir.
1987).
 
United States v. Zone, 403 F.3d 1101, 1104 (9th Cir. 2005). In
 
United States v. Figueroa-Soto, 938 F.2d 1015, 1019 (9th Cir.
 
1991), evidence in support of the Bartkus exception included
 
proof that the Arizona prosecution had been initiated at the
 
request of the federal authorities, the federal authorities had
 
assisted the state in the investigation, evidence had been
 
provided to the state by federal authorities, federal prosecutors
 
had used their sentencing power to influence a witness in the
 
state case, and the two actions had been prosecuted by the same
 
attorney. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth
 
Circuit explained:
 
As Bartkus makes plain, there may be very close coordination
in the prosecutions, in the employment of agents of one
sovereign to help the other sovereign in its prosecution,
and in the timing of the court proceedings so that the
maximum assistance is mutually rendered by the sovereigns.
None of this close collaboration amounts to one government
being the other's "tool" or providing a "sham" or "cover."
Collaboration between state and federal authorities is "the
 conventional practice." No constitutional barrier exists to
 this norm of cooperative effort.
 
Figueroa-Soto , 938 F.2d at 1020. 
Accordingly, Taylor's arguments that the State's
 
Attorney General stood "side by side" with the U.S. Attorney when
 
9

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI rI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the federal prosecution and plea were publicized and the State's
 
presentation to the grand jury was based upon the investigation
 
and evidence of the federal prosecution without independent or
 
joint State investigation, when viewed in conjunction with the
 
State's assertion that it interviewed other witnesses whose
 
statements were not included within the Government's file and
 
obtained an appraisal of the artifacts from Steve Rosen, does not
 
amount to one government being a tool or providing a sham or
 
cover for another. The circuit court, thus, was not wrong in
 
concluding that the dual sovereignty doctrine applied and did not
 
clearly err in finding that Taylor failed to show the two
 
prosecutions were so intertwined as to warrant not applying the
 
doctrine.
 
The federal double jeopardy bar to successive
 
prosecutions of the "same" offense as set forth in Blockburger v.
 
United States, 284 U.S. 299 (1932), applies to successive
 
prosecutions by a single sovereign and not to different
 
sovereigns that could apply the dual sovereignty principle.
 
Successive prosecutions are barred by the Fifth
Amendment only if the two offenses for which the defendant
is prosecuted are the "same" for double jeopardy purposes.
Respondent does not contravene petitioner's contention that
the offenses of "murder during a kidnaping" and "malice
murder," as construed by the courts of Alabama and Georgia
respectively, may be considered greater and lesser offenses
and, thus, the "same" offense under Brown v. Ohio, [432 U.S.
161, 97 S. Ct. 2221, 53 L. Ed. 2d 187 (1977)], absent
operation of the dual sovereignty principle. See id., at
 
169; Illinois v. Vitale, 447 U.S. 410, 100 S. Ct. 2260, 65
L. Ed. 2d 228 (1980). We therefore assume, arguendo, that,
had these offenses arisen under the laws of one State and
 had petitioner been separately prosecuted for both offenses
in that State, the second conviction would have been barred
by the Double Jeopardy Clause.
 
Heath, 474 U.S. at 87-88 (emphases added). As such, in the
 
instant case, because alleged successive prosecutions involved
 
different sovereigns and the dual sovereignty principle applies
 
under the United States Constitution, a determination that the
 
federal and state offenses are the same would not constitute
 
double jeopardy or bar the State prosecution. 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI rI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
C.	 DOUBLE JEOPARDY UNDER ARTICLE I, SECTION 10 OF THE
HAWAIrI CONSTITUTION 
Taylor contends the circuit court erred when it denied 
his double jeopardy claim made pursuant to article I, section 10 
of the Hawai ri Constitution. 
Article I, section 10 of the Hawai ri Constitution 
provides, in relevant part: "nor shall any person be subject for 
the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy." 
However, both the federal and state governments can
 
prosecute the same acts. Heath, 474 U.S. at 88-89, 106 S. Ct. at
 
437. Taylor cites to no authority to support his position that
 
article I, section 10, rejects the dual sovereignty doctrine, and
 
we find no such authority. Additionally, HRS § 701-112 does not
 
bar a subsequent State prosecution to a federal prosecution when
 
the subsequent prosecution required the proof of a fact not
 
required by the federal offense and the State law defining the
 
offense is intended to prevent a substantially different harm or
 
evil than the federal offense -- as is the case here. 
Furthermore, it does not appear that the State
 
prosecution was a sham or cover for the federal prosecution based
 
on the State's Attorney General's standing "side by side" with
 
the U.S. Attorney when the federal prosecution and plea were
 
publicized and the State's presentation to the grand jury of the
 
federal investigation and evidence without independent or joint
 
State investigation, when viewed in conjunction with the State's
 
assertion that it interviewed other witnesses whose statements
 
were not included within the Government's file and obtained an
 
appraisal of the artifacts from Steve Rosen, in light of
 
Figueroa-Soto, 938 F.2d at 1019-20; Zone, 403 F.3d at 1104;
 
Bartkus v. Illinois, 359 U.S. 121, 122-24, 79 S. Ct. 676, 677-78
 
(1959). The circuit court did not clearly err in finding that
 
Taylor failed to demonstrate that the State prosecution was a
 
sham or cover for the federal prosecution.

D.	 SUFFICIENCY OF THE THEFT CHARGE AS "PROPERTY OF
 
ANOTHER" UNDER HRS §§ 708-800, 708-830(1), AND
708-830.5(1)(a)
 
Taylor contends the circuit court erred in denying his
 
claim that, as a matter of law, the artifacts were not "property
 
of another" for purposes of HRS §§ 708-800, 708-830(1), and 708­
830.5(1)(a) under theories that the State had presented to the
 
grand jury and the circuit court, and due process thus required
 
dismissal under article I, section 5 of the Hawai
ri Constitution 
and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States
 Constitution.
 
HRS § 708-830(1) provides:

 
§708-830 Theft.  A person commits theft if the person
does any of the following:
 
(1)	 Obtains or exerts unauthorized control over
 
property. A person obtains, or exerts control
over, the property of another with intent to
deprive the other of the property.
 
HRS § 708-800 (1993) defines "unauthorized control over
 
property" as "control over property of another which is not
 
authorized by the owner." HRS § 708-800 defines "property of
 
another" as "property which any person, other then the defendant,
 
has possession of or any other interest in, even though that
 
possession or interest is unlawful." HRS § 708-830.5(1)(a)
 
defines Theft in the First Degree as follows:
 
§708-830.5 Theft in the First Degree.  (1) A person

The instant indictment charged, in pertinent part:
 
On or about the 17th day of June, 2004, in the County
of Hawaii, State of Hawaii, DANIEL TAYLOR, did obtain or
exert unauthorized control over the property of another, to

exceeds Twenty Thousand Dollars ($20,000.00), with intent to
deprive the other of the property, thereby committing the
offense of Theft in the First Degree in violation of
Sections 708-830(1) and 708-830.5(1)(a) of the Hawaii
Revised Statutes.

In State v. Nases, 65 Haw. 217, 649 P.2d 1138 (1982),
 
involving theft of a calculator, Nases argued that a fatal flaw
 
existed between the charge (alleging that the calculator was the
 
property of Setsuko Yokoyama and Setsuko Yokoyama doing business
 
as Kalakaua Kleaners) and the proof presented at trial (the
 
calculator was actually the property of Kalakaua Kleaners, a
 
corporation). Id. at 217-18, 649 P.2d at 1139. The Hawai ri 
Supreme Court stated:
 
It has long been settled that where the offense is obtaining
control over the property of another, proof that the
property was the property of another is all that is
necessary and the naming of the person owning the property
in the indictment is surplusage. State v. Riddle, 245 Mo.
 
451, 150 S.W. 1044 (1912); State v. Simpson, 32 Nev. 138,
 104 P. 244 (1909); and Commonwealth v. Buckley, 148 Mass.
 27, 18 N.E. 577 (1888). Compare State v. Peters, 44 Haw. 1,
352 P.2d 329 (1959). It is undisputed that the calculator
did not belong to appellant but was the property of another.
The particular ownership of the property in question was not
an essential element in proving the crime and there is no
fatal variance between the charge and the proof.
 
Id. at 218, 649 P.2d at 1139-40 (emphasis added).
 
Additionally, where a statute only requires proof that
 
the defendant was not the owner of the property taken, "an
 
averment and a showing that a possessory or other property
 
interest in the thing stolen is in someone other than the thief
 
and proof that the thief knew that he had no right to the
 
property taken are sufficient." Commonwealth v. Souza, 397 Mass.
 
236, 238, 490 N.E.2d 1173, 1175 (1986) (internal quotation marks, 
citation, and brackets omitted). 
Evidence presented to the grand jury to secure the
 
indictment of Taylor included the following. The artifacts of
 
the J.S. Emerson Collection were obtained from Kanupa Cave by
 
Joseph Swift Emerson and some of those artifacts were sold by him
 
to the Bishop and Peabody Museums. It was documented that the
 
State, Hui Malama, OHA, and Bishop Museum brought some of the
 
museums' artifacts back to Kanupa for repatriation and reburial. 
Taylor was a suspect in an investigation of theft of Hawaiian
 
artifacts from Kanupa Cave. In the federal prosecution, Taylor
 
13
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI rI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
entered into a Plea Agreement, and Taylor's statement included
 
that he went to Kanupa Cave, removed the rock blocking the cave
 
entrance, saw a lot of artifacts in woven lauhala baskets and
 
wrapped in black cloth, took about 157 artifacts from the cave
 
and tried to sell them, and some of the items had Emerson
 
Collection labels on them. Taylor acknowledged in his Plea
 
Agreement that he knew the items belonged to the Emerson
 
Collection, he saw Emerson tags on the items, and he removed the
 
Emerson tags. Taylor's statement also included that he attempted
 
to sell or did sell some of the items. As a result of the
 
execution of a search warrant at Taylor's residence, 2 pieces of
 
a sled runner from the Peabody Museum's collection of artifacts
 
were recovered.
 
From the foregoing facts, consistent with Nases, it
 
appears clear that the artifacts did not belong to Taylor in
 
light of evidence that the artifacts once were possessed by
 
Emerson and the museums and that the State, Hui Malama, OHA, and
 
Bishop Museum participated in the repatriation and reburial at
 
Kanupa Cave. The identity of the actual owner of the artifacts
 
is not required, and the evidence on appeal reveals the previous
 
possession of the artifacts by the Emerson Collection, its sale
 
of the artifacts to the Bishop and Peabody Museums, and the
 
involvement by the State and other entities in the repatriation
 
of the artifacts from the museums and reburial in Kanupa Cave. 
Irrespective of the State's later assertion that it owned the
 
artifacts, specification of the actual owner of the property for
 
purposes of this theft charge is not required and only evidence
 
that the property was not that of Taylor is required. The issue
 
of field or conflict preemption in the State's asserted claim to
 
ownership of the repatriated artifacts does not appear to be
 
necessary and we decline to discuss it. Consequently, the
 
circuit court did not wrongly conclude that Nases sufficed to
 
deny Taylor's motion to dismiss the charge.
