IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
HAWAII HOUSING FINANCE AND DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION,
A PUBLIC BODY AND A BODY CORPORATION AND
 
POLITIC OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v. JAMES TODD TACHERA, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
KOOLAUPOKO DIVISION
 
(CIVIL NO. 1RC07-1-2680)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant James Todd Tachera (Tachera) 
appeals from the Judgment for Possession (Judgment) and Writ of 
Possession (Writ), filed on October 9, 2007, in the District Court of the First Circuit, Ko' olaupoko Division (District 
Court), in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee Hawaii Housing Finance and 
Development Corporation, a Public Body and a Body Corporation and 
Politic of the State of Hawai' i (HHFDC).

I. BACKGROUND
 
This appeal involves an agricultural lot, consisting of 
approximately 62.5 acres, Tax Map Key (TMK) No. 4-8-07:11, 
located in the Waiahole Valley Subdivision in Kaneohe, Hawai' i, 
on the island of Oahu (Lot). The Lot has been occupied by

Writ.

Tachera or his relatives since the late 1960s and used for
 
diversified agricultural purposes. Tachera paid a rental rate of
 
$28 per month. 
Prior to 1994, the Lot was managed by the State of 
Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR). On 
December 3, 1983, DLNR issued Revocable Permit No. S-6071 
(Permit) to Tachera to use the Lot for agricultural purposes. 
The Permit was initially issued for one year and thereafter on a 
monthly basis. The Permit contained the following provision 
regarding revocation: "The Board may revoke this Permit for any 
reason whatsoever, upon written notice to the Permittee at least 
thirty (30) days prior to such revocation." 
On or about September 13, 2002, Tachera was notified by
 
the DLNR:
 
It appears back in 1995 our staff failed to inform you that
the 62.50 acre parcel you were renting from our Department
was turned over to the Housing and Community Development
Corporation of Hawaii (HCDCH).
2 Our staff terminated your
month-to-month revocable permit on December 31, 1993.
 
To make your continued use of the property legal, you need
to call the Housing and Community Development Corporation of
Hawaii . . . to either obtain a lease or permit.
 
There is no evidence in the record that Tachera thereafter
 
entered into a written lease.
 
By letter dated September 25, 2006, reportedly after
 
correspondence offering a long-term lease, Tachera was notified
 
by HHFDC that it was "terminating his month-to-month lease[.]" 
The September 25, 2006 termination letter also stated:
 
The HHFDC further rescinds its offer for a long-term lease
of the Lot . . . . All previous HCDCH offers expired after
you failed to timely accept them by the deadlines set forth
in the HCDCH letters dated February 24, 2005, March 24,
2005, May 11, 2005[,] and June 21, 2005. This FINAL NOTICE
 AND DEMAND TO VACATE the Lot serves as written advance
 forty-five (45) days notice that you must vacate the
property no later than November 13, 2006.
 
2
 The HHFDC has undergone several name changes. The HHFDC was
 
formerly known as the Housing and Community Development Corporation of Hawaii
(HCDCH), as well as the Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HFDC).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
. . . The termination of your month-to-month lease is based
on delinquent lease rent, outstanding water payments, and
. . . violations of the [Declaration of Restrictive
Covenants for Waiahole Valley Agricultural Park and
Residential Lots Subdivision and Homestead Road Lands].
 
The letter was signed by Orlando "Dan" Davidson, Executive
 
Director of HHFDC. Tachera did not vacate the Lot and continued
 
to occupy the Lot after November 13, 2006.
 
On May 3, 2007, HHFDC filed a "Complaint for Ejectment
 
or in the Alternative for Summary Possession" (Complaint) against
 
Tachera, seeking a judgment for possession and a writ of
 
possession. Tachera did not file a written answer to the
 
Complaint and did not assert any counterclaims, cross-claims, or
 
third-party claims.
 
On July 12, 2007, the District Court began a three-day
 
trial on HHFDC's Complaint.3 Thereafter, on October 1, 2007, the
 
District Court issued "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and
 Decision," including:
 
FINDINGS OF FACT
 
. . . .
 
3.	 [HHFDC] is the owner or is the authorized agent of the
owner of real property (hereafter sometimes referred
to as the property) situated in Waihole [sic] Valley,
District of Koolaupoko, City and County of Honolulu,
State of Hawaii described as 62.50 acres of
 agricultural farmland with a Tax Map Key of 4-8-07:11,
lots 1 and 2.
 
4.	 The property has been occupied by [Tachera] or his
relatives since the late 1960s.
 
5.	 On December 2, 1983[,] [HHFDC's] predecessor in
interest and [Tachera] signed Revocable Permit No. SÂ­6071 allowing [Tachera] to occupy the property on a
"month-to-month" basis at a rental rate of $28 per
month.
 
6.	 [Tachera] presently continues to pay and [HHFDC]
presently continues to accept rent. [Tachera] is
current with respect to rent.

 The Honorable Barbara Richardson appears to have presided over the
trial on July 12, 2007. The Honorable Christopher P. McKenzie presided over
the trial on July 27, 2007, and August 7, 2007.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
7.	 Permit No. S-607 [sic]4
 provided among other things:
"The Board may revoke this Permit for any reason
whatsoever, upon written notice to the Permittee at
least thirty (30) days prior to such revocation. . .
."
 
8.	 Prior to 1994[,] the property was owned and/or managed
by [t]he State of Hawaii Department of Land and
Natural Resources (sometimes referred to as [HHFDC's]
predecessor in interest). In 1994[,] ownership and/or
management of the property was transferred to [HHFDC].
 
9.	 On September 13, 2002[,] [Tachera] was notified by
letter that he was to contact [HHFDC] to obtain a
lease or permit. 
[Tachera] did not.
 
10.	 That same September 13, 2002 letter advised [Tachera]
that Permit No. S-607 [sic] was terminated on December
31, 1993.
 
11.	 From, at least, September 13, 2002[,] to present[,]
[Tachera] has used the property in accordance with the
terms of Permit No. S-607 [sic] and has paid rent
which was accepted by [HHFDC].
 
12.	 On February 24, 2005, March 24, 2005, May 11, 2005 and
June 21, 2005[,] [HHFDC] offered [Tachera] a long term
lease of the property. [Tachera] did not respond to
or accept the offers.
 
13.	 By letter dated September 25, 2006, mailed on
September 26, 2006 and received by [Tachera] on
September 28, 2006[,] [HHFDC] terminated the month to
month tenancy and instructed [Tachera] to vacate the
property not later than November 13, 2006.
 
. . . .
 
15.	 The principle use of the property by [Tachera] is for
farming of diversified agriculture.
 
. . . .
 
19.	 [Tachera] did not operate a vehicle junkyard on the
property[.]
 
20.	 Anyone, other than [Tachera], who occupied the
premises were either homeless squatters or an
acquaintance of [Tachera] that stayed on the property
temporarily to help with the farming.
 
21.	 Any improvements on the property . . . were built
according to applicable codes and are functioning as
intended[.]
 
4
 Although the District Court order states "Permit No. S-607," the
District Court clearly intended to refer to "Permit No. S-6071," which is the
only permit referenced in the record.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
 
1.	 This court has jurisdiction over the subject matter
and the parties.
 
2.	 [HHFDC] is bound by the actions of the State of
Hawaii, Department of Land and Natural Resources'[s]
actions as they relate to the property.
 
3.	 [HHFDC] and its predecessor in interest's inaction
after its purported termination of Permit S-607 [sic]
was reasonably relied on by [Tachera] to his
detriment. Accordingly, [HHFDC] is estopped from
claiming the permit was revoked or has waived its
right to revoke the permit.
 
4.	 The terms of Permit S-607 [sic] govern the rights and
duties of [HHFDC] and [Tachera] with respect to the
property.
 
5.	 Hawaii Revised Statutes, Chapter 521, Residential
Landlord-Tenant Code does not apply to this matter.
 
6.	 Permit S-607 [sic] created a month to month tenancy
between [HHFDC] and [Tachera].
 
7.	 Except for [Tachera's] obligation to vacate, he is not
otherwise in violation of Permit S-607 [sic].
 
8.	 [HHFDC's] notice of at least 45 days to vacate the
property was reasonable under the circumstances of
this case.
 
9.	 Said notice was both definite and seasonable as to
 when [Tachera] should vacate and was not
misunderstood.
 
10.	 [HHFDC's] notice to vacate was in accordance with the
terms of Permit S-607 [sic].
 
11.	 Even if Permit S-607 [sic] did not apply to govern the
rights and duties of the parties and [Tachera] was
considered a tenant-at-will, [HHFDC's] termination of
the tenancy and notice to vacate was valid and
effective.
 
The District Court concluded that HHFDC was entitled to
 
a judgment for possession. On October 9, 2007, the District
 
Court issued the Judgment and Writ. On October 15, 2007, Tachera
 
filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied on November
 
23, 2007. Tachera timely filed a notice of appeal. 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
II.	 POINTS OF ERROR
 
Tachera raises the following points of error on appeal:
 
(1) HHFDC failed to establish its title to the
 
property and, therefore, the District Court erred in entering
 Judgment for Possession in favor of HHFDC;
 
(2) HHFDC failed to establish any of the violations
 
asserted in its Complaint as the grounds for termination of the
 
tenancy and, therefore, the District court erred in entering
 
Judgment in favor of HHFDC;
 
(3) The district court's conclusions of law (COLs)
 
that HHFDC's notice to vacate was reasonable and enforceable are
 contrary to controlling law;
 
(4) The District Court's finding of fact (FOF) 12 that
 
"[o]n February 24, 2005, March 24, 2005, May 11, 2005[,] and June
 21, 2005, [HHFDC] offered [Tachera] a long term lease of the
 
property . . . [and] [Tachera] did not respond to or accept the
 
offers" is not supported by admissible evidence;
 
(5) The District Court's COL that it has jurisdiction
 
over this lawsuit is erroneous;
 
(6) The actions of the HHFDC and the District Court in 
terminating Tachera's interest in the property without cause 
deprived Tachera of his due process and equal protection rights 
under both the United States and Hawai' i Constitutions; and 
(7) HHFDC and the District Court failed to protect
 
Tachera's right to be compensated for the value of his growing
 
crops or the right to harvest such crops post-termination.
 
III. APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
"Points not presented in accordance with [Hawai' i Rules 
of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4)] will be disregarded, 
except that the appellate court, at its option, may notice a 
plain error not presented." HRAP 28(b)(4). 
A trial court's FOFs are subject to the clearly
 
erroneous standard of review. Chun v. Bd. of Trs. of the
 
6
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Employees' Ret. Sys. of the State of Hawai' i, 106 Hawai' i 416, 
430, 106 P.3d 339, 353 (2005). 
An FOF is clearly erroneous when, despite evidence to
support the finding, the appellate court is left with the
definite and firm conviction in reviewing the entire
evidence that a mistake has been committed. An FOF is also
 clearly erroneous when the record lacks substantial evidence
to support the finding. We have defined substantial
 evidence as credible evidence which is of sufficient quality
and probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution
to support a conclusion.
 
Bhakta v. County of Maui, 109 Hawai' i 198, 208, 124 P.3d 943, 953 
(2005) (citations and brackets omitted). 
A COL is not binding upon an appellate court and is 
freely reviewable for its correctness. Chun, 106 Hawai' i at 430, 
106 P.3d at 353 (internal quotation marks, citations, and 
brackets omitted). The appellate court reviews COLs under the 
right/wrong standard. Id. Thus, a COL that is supported by the 
trial court's FOFs, and that reflects an application of the correct rule of law, will not be overturned. Id. A COL that 
presents mixed questions of fact and law is reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard because the court's conclusions are 
dependent upon the facts and circumstances of each individual 
case. Chun, 106 Hawai' i at 430, 106 P.3d at 353. 
"The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law 
that [the appellate court reviews] de novo under the right/wrong 
standard." Captain Andy's Sailing, Inc. v. Dep't of Land & 
Natural Res., State of Hawai
'i, 113 Hawai' i 184, 192, 150 P.3d 
833, 841 (2006) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). 
IV. DISCUSSION
 A. Ownership of the Lot
 
Tachera alleges that HHFDC failed to prove ownership of
 
the Lot because no deed transferring title was entered into
 evidence to show that title passed from DLNR to HHFDC. 
Tachera
 
nevertheless bases much of his appeal on Act 330, enacted by the
 
7
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
1993 Hawai' i State Legislature.5 Act 330, approved June 23, 
1993, expressly provided for the transfer of the subject Lot, TMK
 
No. 4-8-07:11, from DLNR to HFDC, the former name of HHFDC:6
 
SECTION 1. The housing and development corporation
(HFDC) is developing an agricultural park and low-density
residential development approximately six hundred acres of
land in Waiahole Valley on the island of Oahu. HFDC holds
 title to this land. The purpose of this park and
development is to provide long-term affordable rental
housing for tenants in Waiahole and Waikane valleys[,] . . .
to promote diversified agriculture, and to preserve the
rural lifestyle of the valleys.
 
There are ten parcels abutting the HFDC property under
control of the department of land and natural resources
(DLNR). These lands are farmed by the tenants, who are a
part of the wider Waiahole-Waikane community. Combining
these lots with the HHFDC property would promote the master
planning of diversified agriculture in Waiahole, make
government functions more efficient by having one state
agency overseeing the area, and help bring the community
together.
 
The purpose of this Act is to transfer to these ten
parcels of land to HHFDC so that they may be consolidated in
the Waiahole agricultural park.
 
SECTION 2. The following parcels of land are hereby
transferred from DLNR to HHFDC: 
Tax map key number .  .  .  
4-8-07:11          
.  .  .  Lot size .  .  . 
62.5 acres 
.  .  . 
        
 
The transfer shall be effective immediately and DLNR shall
be responsible for properly documenting the change in title.
 
SECTION 3. Upon taking title to the above-listed
parcels HHFDC shall immediately offer leases to those
persons who hold revocable permits to the parcels from DLNR
as of the effective date of this Act. The leases shall be
 negotiated and shall be on the same terms as leases offered
to all other persons leasing parcels from HHFDC within the
Waiahole agricultural park.
 
SECTION 4. 
This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
 
1993 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 330, at 762. By operation of law, as
 
conceded by Tachera on appeal, HHFDC owns or controls the subject
 
5
 In the court below, neither party nor the district court discussed
or addressed Act 330.
 
6
 See n.3 above regarding agency name changes.
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Lot. In addition, HHFDC presented probative evidence of 
ownership or administrative control of the Lot, as determined by 
the District Court, and Tachera did not present any evidence to 
counter HHFDC's claim of ownership or administrative control. 
Tachera does not contest COL 4, in which the District Court 
concluded: "The terms of Permit S-607[1] govern the rights and 
duties of [HHFDC] and [Tachera] with respect to the property." 
Finally, for purposes of summary possession, HHFDC sufficiently 
established its right to seek possession of the Lot. See, e.g., 
Kee Tun v. Ching Shai, 11 Haw. 444, 447 (Hawai' i Rep. 1898) 
("[w]here neither party has title, the one who on the whole has 
the better right to the possession should prevail" ). 
B. Grounds for Termination of Tachera's Tenancy
 Tachera argues that the District Court erred in
 
entering the Judgment in favor of HHFDC because HHFDC did not
 establish any of the restrictive covenant violations identified
 
in the Complaint. Tachera argues that it was improper for the
 
District Court to enter judgment based on "an 'alternative'
 
theory that neither [party] pled or litigated (i.e., the theory
 
that 'cause' for termination was not required)." However,
 
Tachera makes no argument that the terms of the Permit do not or
 
7
should not apply,  and does not assert that he raised any
objection in the District Court based on insufficient pleading or 
a failure to amend the Complaint to include this alternate 
theory. Enoka v. AIG Hawai' i Ins. Co., 109 Hawai' i 537, 546, 128 
P.3d 950, 859 (2006) ("In general, failure to raise or properly reserve issues at the trial level would be deemed waived." 
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). Accordingly, 
we need not further address Tachera's second point of error. 
7
 On the contrary, in his motion for reconsideration, Tachera
favorably cited the court's conclusion regarding the applicability of the
Permit, but argued that, under the circumstances, it would be "fair and
equitable" for the court to allow him to remain a tenant under the terms and
conditions of the Permit.
 
9
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
C. HHFDC's Notice to Vacate
 Tachera argues that the District Court erred in
 
entering COLs Nos. 8-11 because the conclusions are contrary to
 controlling law. Tachera primarily argues that Act 330 required
 
that Tachera be given a long-term lease offer, and as such, he
 
was entitled to more than a mere possessory interest in the Lot
 
and HHFDC was required to follow its procedures for termination
 
of long-term, written leases.
 
Tachera's point of error fails to comply with HRAP Rule 
28(b)(4) in that Tachera does not state where in the record the alleged error occurred or where the error was objected to. In 
addition, it appears that Tachera's argument regarding Act 330 is 
presented for the first time on appeal. This court need not 
consider a point that was not appropriately presented in the 
trial court. See HRS Â§ 641-2 (2004) ("The appellate court . . . 
need not consider a point that was not presented in the trial court in an appropriate manner."); see also Okuhara v. Broida, 51 
Haw. 253, 255, 456 P.2d 228, 230 (1969); Craft v. Peebles, 78 
Hawai'i 287, 294, 893 P.2d 138, 145 (1995); Price v. AIG Hawai' i 
Ins. Co., Inc., 107 Hawai' i 106, 111, 111 P.3d 1, 6 (2005); HRAP 
Rule 28(b)(4)(iii). 
Even assuming, arguendo, that Act 330 entitled Tachera
 
to an offer to enter into a long-term lease of the Lot, there is
 testimony in the record that HHFDC made multiple long-term lease
 
offers to Tachera and that Tachera did not respond. On direct
 
examination, HHFDC's witness, Marlene Lemke (Lemke), testified as
 
follows:
 
Q [(by HHFDC's Attorney)] Ms. Lemky [sic], since 1994
when the lot was transferred to [HHFDC], was there ever a
written interim lease agreement with Mr. Tachera to lease
the subject agricultural lot?
 
A [(by Lemke)] No, there wasn't.
 Q What about since 1994, was there ever a
long-term lease agreement with Mr. Tachera to lease the
agricultural lot?
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
A Mr. Tachera was sent letters offering him a
long-term lease in 2005, but there was no response by set
deadlines and so there was no long-term lease issued.
 
Tachera's attorney did not object to the Lemke's
 
testimony regarding the long-term lease offers. In fact, when
 
HHFDC's attorney first began questioning Lemke regarding the
 
HHFDC's offers to Tachera, Tachera's attorney's only objection
 
was to the relevancy of such questions, not as to whether such
 
offers were actually made. Although Tachera's attorney later
 
cross-examined Lemke as to whether she was personally involved in
 
making much offers, there was no objection on Tachera's part
 
regarding Lemke's personal knowledge. "The grounds for an
 
objection must be specifically stated in order to preserve a
 
point for appeal." Lee v. Kimura, 2 Haw. App. 538, 546, 634 P.2d
 
1043, 1049 (1981) (citations omitted). In addition, Tachera
 himself seems to acknowledge that he had been offered a lease at
 
some point, but was unsatisfied with the proposed terms:
 
THE COURT: You don't have a long-term lease.
 
MR. TACHERA: As what I was trying to work for and that's
why I explain to 'em before, how can I sign a lease that,
it's like Catch 22, I cannot comply with. Why I go sign
something. It's just like putting a rope around my neck,
you know what I mean . . ."
 
Although not properly identified as a point of error,
 
including where in the record the issue was raised before the
 
trial court, Tachera argues that HHFDC's notice to vacate could
 
not have been reasonable and/or in accordance with the terms of
 
the Permit because the decision to revoke was not carried out by
 
a "Board" acting by majority vote of a quorum. In doing so, he
 
is presumably challenging COL 10, but this is unclear. Tachera
 
asserts that a conclusion of reasonable notice is inconsistent
 
with unchallenged FOF 7, which found that "Permit No. S-607[1]
 
provided among other things: 'The Board may revoke this Permit
 
for any reason whatsoever, upon written notice to the Permittee
 
at least thirty (30) days prior to such revocation[.]'" 
Tachera's argument that the District Court's conclusions are in
 
11
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
conflict with its findings is not identified in Tachera's points
 
of error, the specific conclusion Tachera is challenging is not
 
specified, Tachera does not identify where in the record the
 
alleged error occurred or where it was brought to the attention
 
of the trial court, thereby violating HRAP Rule 28(b)(4), and
 
Tachera's argument otherwise appears to be without merit. The
 
District Court's conclusion that termination of Tachera's monthÂ­
to-month occupancy, by HHFDC (DLNR's successor-in-interest to the
 
Lot), was properly instituted by the letter signed by HHFDC
 
Executive Director did not create a conflict between any of its
 
FOFs or COLs.
 
D. FOF 12
 In a related argument, Tachera argues that FOF 12 was
 
not supported by admissible evidence. As stated above, FOF 12
 provides that "[o]n February 24, 2004, March 24, 2005, May 11,
 
2005[,] and June 21, 2005[,] [HHFDC] offered [Tachera] a long
 
term lease of the property. [Tachera] did not respond to or
 
accept the offers." Tachera argues that the only evidence on the
 
record of long-term lease offers was Exhibit 5 (the lease
 
termination letter), that Exhibit 5 contains hearsay within
 
hearsay, and that Lemke did not have personal knowledge of the
 
contents of Exhibit 5. Tachera objected to the admission of
 
Exhibit 5 on other grounds. The District Court agreed that
 
portions of the letter constituted hearsay and limited the scope
 
of the letter's admissibility as follows:
 
THE COURT: [M]y inclination then would be . . . [to] accept
[E]xhibit 5 in evidence, but not for the purposes of proving
that the lot was not used for diversified agriculture, not
for the purposes of proving that [Tachera is] leasing or
renting a single-family dwelling on the lot, and not for the
purposes of proving that the lot is used as a junkyard, or
automobile junkyard, or that there are noxious, illegal or
offensive activity [sic] being carried out, and not for the
purpose of proving that he failed to make any improvements
on the lot.
 
. . . .
 For that reason, it's hearsay that goes to the crux of this
 
case.
 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
. . . .
 
I'll receive [E]xhibit 5 in evidence, but not for the
purpose of proving the truth of those allegations that I
mentioned.
 
. . . .
 [HHFDC's ATTORNEY]: And you're allowing . . . proof that
the month-to-month lease was terminated?
 
THE COURT: Yes.
 
Whether or not the letter was admitted for the purpose
 
of establishing that offers were made to Tachera was not
 
addressed by the District Court because Tachera made no argument
 
or objection as such. 
In any event, FOF 12 is supported, as discussed above,
 
by Lemke's unchallenged testimony that such offers were made to
 
Tachera. Accordingly, FOF 12 is not clearly erroneous. 
E. Jurisdiction 
Tachera asserts that the District Court lacked 
jurisdiction over this summary possession action because: 
(1) an
 
administrative hearing was required; and (2) at a minimum, there
 were "issues of equity" that should have resolved in the Circuit
 
Court. However, as Tachera concedes, the administrative rules he
 
relies on do not appear to "technically" apply to HHFDC. 
Moreover, this primary jurisdiction argument does not appear to
 
have been raised in the District Court, although a related
 
question was posed to HHFDC's witness, and Tachera does not argue
 
that exclusive jurisdiction over this matter lies elsewhere. 
Indeed, Tachera does not challenge the District Court's findings
 
and conclusions that the terms of the Permit govern the rights
 
and duties of the parties, including the creation of a month-toÂ­
month tenancy. Tachera's arguments regarding the "equities" of
 
this case are equally unavailing. There is no evidence that
 
Tachera entered into a long-term lease. In ejectment and summary
 
possession proceedings, the District Court can exercise
 
jurisdiction where the title to real estate is not in question.

See HRS Â§Â§ 604-5(d), 604-6, and 666-6 (1993); see also Queen Emma
 
Foundation v. Tingco, 74 Haw. 294, 305-06, 845 P.2d 1186, 1191
 
(1992). Although Tachera argues that HHFDC did not prove its
 
title, as we discussed above, there is no meaningful dispute as
 
to whether HHFDC owns the land, and Tachera himself does not
 
claim title. Thus, title to real estate was not at issue and
 
jurisdiction was proper. Furthermore, Tachera's failure to
 
challenge the basis of the District Court's decision, i.e., that
 
the Permit governs, renders his argument that he has more than a
 
mere possessory interest unpersuasive. Not only does Tachera
 
fail to challenge COL 4, Tachera also does not challenge COL 6,
 
which provides that "Permit S-607[1] created a month to month
 
tenancy between [HHFDC] and [Tachera]."
 
F. Due Process and Equal Protection
 
Tachera presents conclusory assertions that the 
District Court and HHFDC violated his due process and equal protection rights by depriving Tachera of the Lot without cause. 
Without support or elaboration as to how specifically the 
District Court erred with respect to these allegations, Tachera 
fails to present a discernible argument. "An appellate court 
need not address matters as to which the appellant has failed to 
present a discernible argument." Int'l Sav. & Loan Ass'n, 93 
Hawai'i at 473, 5 P.3d at 463; HRAP Rule 28(b)(7) (stating that 
the argument in the opening brief must contain "citations to the 
authorities, statutes and parts of the record relied on" and 
"[p]oints not argued may be deemed waived"); see also, e.g., Ala 
Moana Boat Owners' Ass'n v. State, 50 Haw. 156, 158, 434 P.2d 
516, 518 (1967) (citations omitted; Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 
80 Hawai' i 225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 558 (1995); Citicorp Mortgage, 
Inc. v. Bartolome, 94 Hawai' i 422, 433, 16 P.3d 827, 838 (App. 
2000).

G. Compensation for Crops
 
Lastly, Tachera argues that he was entitled to 
compensation for the value of the crops on the Lot at the time his tenancy was terminated pursuant to the common law doctrine of 
emblements.  Tachera did not request such compensation in the 
court below, and this argument is clearly raised for the first 
time on appeal; thus, we need not consider this point. See HRS 
Â§ 641-2; Okuhara, 51 Haw. at 255, 456 P.2d at 230; Craft, 78 Hawai'i at 294, 893 P.2d at 145; Price, 107 Hawai' i at 111, 111 
P.3d at 6; HRAP Rule 28(b)(4)(iii). V. CONCLUSION
 
For these reasons, the District Court's October 9, 2007
 
Judgment for Possession is affirmed.
