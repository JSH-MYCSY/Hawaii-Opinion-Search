IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
KATHLEEN M. CARSTENSEN, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
RICHARD D. CARSTENSEN, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-DIVORCE NO. 01-1-2705)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Richard Carstensen ("Richard") 
appeals from the "Order Re: Defendant's Motion for Relief" 
("Order") entered by the Family Court for the First Circuit ("Family Court") on November 28, 2007.
1 The Order denied 
Richard's Hawai' i Family Court Rules ("HFCR") Rule 60(b) motion 
for post-decree relief ("HFCR Rule 60(b) Motion") from the property division portion of the December 10, 2003 Divorce Decree ("Decree"), which dissolved Richard's marriage with Plaintiff-Appellee Kathleen Carstensen ("Kathleen"). 
On appeal, Richard contends that the Family Court erred
 
in concluding that: (1) he was not equitably entitled to relief
 pursuant to HFCR Rule 60(b)(5) or (6); (2) his HFCR Rule 60(b)
 Motion was not brought within a reasonable time; and (3) relief
 from the divorce agreement could not be granted because its terms
 were not ambiguous. 
We vacate the Order and remand for further proceedings.

I. Background
 
Kathleen and Richard were married on August 23, 1970. 
During their marriage, Richard served in and subsequently retired
 
from the United States Air Force. According to Richard, at the
 time of the divorce he was receiving $2,446.62 per month of
 military retirement pay ("Retired Pay") and $1,095.00 per month
 
2
of military disability pay ("Disability Pay"),  totaling
$3,554.00 per month.
3
 
Kathleen filed for divorce in 2001, and the parties
 
entered into an Agreement Incident to Divorce on November 11,
 2003 ("Agreement"), whereby the parties agreed that Kathleen
 would receive 72% of Richard's Retired Pay. The Agreement
 provided that the Family Court "retain[s] jurisdiction over
 [Richard's] U.S. Air Force retired pay for so long as the parties
 both shall live" and "shall also have the authority to make every
 just and equitable order not inconsistent with the other
 provisions herein[.]" The Agreement also gave the Family Court
 explicit "authority to make any orders it deems just and
 equitable as a result of the income tax consequences which flow
 from the division and distribution of the retired pay." The
 Decree approved and incorporated the Agreement.
 
The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
 
2004 ("NDAA 2004") was adopted by Congress and became effective
 on January 1, 2004. Pub. L. No. 108-136, § 641(e), 117 Stat.
 1392 (2003) (codified as amended at 10 U.S.C. § 1414). The NDAA
 2004 amended the federal law governing military retirement
 benefits for members eligible for Retired Pay who were also
 eligible for veterans' Disability Pay for disabilities rated 50
 percent or higher, and addressed the concurrent payment of
 Retired Pay and veterans' Disability Pay. Richard became

 Unlike Retired Pay, Disability Pay is not taxed. In addition,
Retired Pay is divisible in a divorce action, while Disability Pay is not.

3/
 The total of the two figures is $3,541.62, not $3554.00. As a
 
result, the subsequent calculations are slightly, but not significantly askew.
Richard noted that if Kathleen were to receive 50% of both the Retired Pay and
the Disability Pay, she would receive $1,770.81, which, he concluded, was 72%
of the Retired Pay.
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"generally aware" of the new law shortly after it took effect. 
Prior to the NDAA 2004's enactment, Retired Pay was
 
subject to a waiver provision whereby a disabled veteran would
 
only receive Disability Pay if he or she waived an equal amount
 of his or her Retired Pay. 38 U.S.C. § 5305 (2000) amended by
 Veterans Benefits Improvement Act of 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-454,
 Tit. III, § 308(b), 118 Stat. 3598, 3614 (2004). Consequently,
 the total amount of Retired Pay and Disability Pay that any
 retiree could receive only equaled the Retired Pay to which he
 was entitled. 
The NDAA 2004, however, phased out of the waiver
 
requirement over ten years, resulting in a phased-in increase in
 the amount of Retired Pay received. 10 U.S.C. § 1414(c). At the
 end of that period, Richard, who was eligible for both Retired
 Pay and Disability Pay, would receive both full Retired Pay and
 full Disability Pay. Consequently, because the Agreement
 provided Kathleen with 72% of Richard's Retired Pay, Richard
 contended that the NDAA 2004 as applied to the Agreement bestowed
 an unintended windfall on Kathleen who would receive 72% of the
 related increase. 
According to Richard, by March 2005 he became aware of
 
the NDAA 2004's effect on his military retirement income and, on
 March 16, 2005, he wrote to Kathleen stating that the 72% formula
 contained in the Agreement/Decree was no longer accurate and
 would need to be recalculated. No informal resolution was ever
 achieved and, so, on May 14, 2007, Richard filed his HFCR Rule
 60(b) Motion seeking relief from the 72% allocation of his
 Retired Pay to Kathleen as provided for in the Agreement and
 incorporated into the Decree. 
Richard argued that the parties' intent was to provide
 
Kathleen with 50% of the sum of his Retired Pay and Disability
 Pay, but that because federal law at the time of the Agreement
 required Richard to waive Retired Pay in order to receive
 Disability Pay and precluded Kathleen from collecting any part of
 his Disability Pay, he had proposed to award Kathleen a larger
 percentage of his Retired Pay in order to effectuate a 50/50
 split of the cumulative benefit amount. Richard further argued
 
3
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that the parties' intent was thwarted by the NDAA 2004 and that
 
this "constituted a material and unexpected change in federal law
 that impacted the allocation of his retirement pay in a manner
 that was unfair to him, and resulted in a windfall to Kathleen."
4
 
The Family Court denied Richard's HFCR Rule 60(b)
 
Motion because it held that (1) HFCR Rule 60(b)(5) "does not
 authorize the Court to amend the division of military retired pay
 after the divorce is final. See Greene v. Greene, 8 Haw. App.
 
559 (1991)"; (2) HFCR Rule 60(b)(6) "does not authorize the
 Family Court to amend a divorce settlement simply by reason of a
 subsequent change in the law" under Hammon v. Monsef, 8 Haw. App.
 58, 64 (1990), that the NDAA 2004 "makes prospective changes (not
 retrospective) changes in the law[,]" and that a "prospective
 change in law is not a sufficient reason to justify amending the
 terms of a divorce pursuant to [HFCR] Rule 60(b)(6)"; and (3) a
 "delay of more than two (2) years in filing a motion pursuant to
 [HFCR] Rule 60(b)(6) . . . based on a change in federal law
 regarding the division of military retired pay is an
 unjustifiable delay" under Greene, 8 Haw. App. at 570, and
 Richard's "failure to file a motion seeking to amend the terms of
 the [Agreement] for over three (3) years after the change in
 federal law is an unjustifiable delay." 
II. Discussion
 
A. Greene does not prohibit the Family Court from amending
the division of military retired pay after the divorce
is final under HFCR Rule 60(b)(5).
 
The Family Court held that relief under HFCR Rule
 
60(b)(5) was unavailable under Greene. Under HFCR Rule 60(b)(5),
 
however, a court may grant relief from a divorce decree where
 
4/
 Kathleen, on the other hand, contended that she had been awarded a
larger percentage of Richard's Retired Pay because she agreed to transfer
title to the parties' home to Richard, that the Family Court correctly
concluded that the intent of the parties in entering into the Agreement was
not relevant, that the Agreement's distribution of Richard's retirement pay
was clear and unambiguous, that Greene v. Greene, 8 Haw. App. 559 (1991)
prohibits the award of relief to Richard under HFCR Rule 60(b)(5), that HFCR
Rule 60(b)(6) does not authorize the Family Court to amend a divorce
settlement simply by reason of a subsequent change in the law, and that
Richard's Rule 60(b) Motion was untimely.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
prospective application of the decree is no longer equitable. 
The analogous provision in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
 
5
("FRCP") Rule 60(b)(5)  is "based on the historic power of a
court of equity to modify its decree in the light of changed
 circumstances." 11 C
HARLES ALAN WRIGHT, ARTHUR R. MILLER & MARY KAY
 
KANE, FEDERAL PRACTICE & PROCEDURE § 2863 (2d ed. 1995). The United
 
States Supreme Court explained that:
 
We are not doubtful of the power of a court of
equity to modify an injunction in adaptation to
changed conditions, though it was entered by consent
. . . . Power to modify the decree was reserved by its
very terms, and so from the beginning went hand in
hand with its restraints. If the reservation had been
 omitted, power there still would be by force of
principles inherent in the jurisdiction of the
chancery. A continuing decree of injunction directed
to events to come is subject always to adaptation as
events may shape the need.
 
United States v. Swift & Co., 286 U.S. 106, 114 (1932). The
 
principle enunciated "applies to any judgment that has
 prospective effect." W
RIGHT ET AL ., supra. 
Other courts have applied analogous rules in analogous
 
situations. See, e.g., California Dep't. of Soc. Servs. v.
 
Leavitt, 523 F.3d 1025 (9th Cir. 2008) (prospective relief
 available under FRCP Rule 60(b)(5) from prior judgment, based on
 the intervening enactment of the Deficit Reduction Act ("DRA")
 since the DRA removed the legal basis for the continuing
 application of the court's order); Valero Terrestrial Corp. v.
 Paige, 211 F.3d 112 (4th Cir. 2000) (vacatur of injunction
 barring enforcement of state law was warranted under FRCP Rule
 60(b)(5) in light of substantial legislative revisions to the
 enjoined statutes); Harvey v. Johanns, 462 F. Supp. 2d 69 (D. Me.
 2006) (legislation changing the law upon which a forward-looking
 consent decree was based is ground for relief from prospective
 enforcement of the judgment under FRCP Rule 60(b)(5)); Rudd v.
 Rudd, 666 P.2d 639 (Idaho 1983) (sufficiently changed
 
5/
 HFCR Rule 60() is similar to Rule 60(b), Hawai' i Rules of Civil 
Procedure ("HRCP") and FRCP Rule 60(b). "Therefore, the treatises and cases
interpreting HRCP, Rule 60(b) and FRCP, Rule 60(b) provide persuasive
reasoning for the interpretation of HFCR Rule 60(b)." Hayashi v. Hayashi, 4
Haw. App. 286, 290 n.6, 666 P.2d 171, 174 n.6 (1983).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
circumstances rendered enforcement in 1978 of a 1975 divorce
 
decree inequitable under Idaho's analogous Rule 60(b)(5)).
 
Richard does not challenge the propriety of the
 
property division at the time that the Decree was entered. 
Rather, Richard seeks modification of the division because the
 subsequent enactment of the NDAA 2004 allegedly changed the
 effect of the Divorce Decree in such a way as to make continued
 enforcement of the 72% provision inequitable.
 
Citing Greene, the Family Court concluded that HFCR
 
Rule 60(b)(5) "does not authorize the Court to amend the division
 of military retired pay after the divorce is final." The basis
 for the court's conclusion is unstated. Although it is not clear
 that Greene stands for the stated principle, the case is, in any
 event, distinguishable in significant respects from this case
 with regard to the HFCR Rule 60(b)(5) analysis and, therefore,
 its application for the stated principle is unwarranted. 
In Greene, this court held that HFCR Rule 60(b)(5) was
 
irrelevant to wife's motion for post-decree relief because she
 was seeking an "order awarding her an equitable share of
 [husband's] military retirement benefits." Greene, 8 Haw. App.
 
at 566, 815 P.2d at 31. Such an order did not fall under the
 ambit of HFCR Rule 60(b)(5) because the original divorce decree
 did not distribute husband's military retirement benefits in the
 first instance. Here, however, the Family Court has already
 divided the retirement benefits, awarding 72% of Richard's
 Retired Pay to Kathleen, and Richard seeks only an order amending
 the prospective enforcement of the Retired Pay provision because,
 allegedly, the application of the NDAA 2004 to the Agreement
 makes continued enforcement of the Decree inequitable. As such,
 and without determining whether HFCR Rule 60(b)(5) relief was
 warranted or considering whether Richard's Rule 60(b) Motion was
 timely, the Family Court erred in concluding that Greene
 precludes relief under the circumstances under HFCR Rule
 60(b)(5).

     NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
B.	 A change in the law that affects the future obligations
of parties toward each other under a judgment where the
court has reserved jurisdiction over the subject is
"something more than a 'mere' change in the law."
 
The Family Court held that relief was unavailable under
 
either HFCR Rule 60(b)(5) or 60(b)(6). Movants under HFCR Rule
 
60(b)(6) must satisfy a three prong test:
 
Rule 60(b)(6) permits the trial court in its sound
discretion to relieve a party from a final judgment.
Isemoto Contracting Co. v. Andrade, 1 Haw. App. 202, 616
P.2d 1022 (1980). Such relief is extraordinary and the
movant must show that (1) the motion is based on some reason
other than those specifically stated in clauses 60(b)(1)
through (5); (2) the reason urged is such as to justify the
relief; and (3) the motion is made within a reasonable time.
7 Moore's Federal Practice § 60.27[1] (2d ed. 1982).
 
Hayashi, 4 Haw. App. at 290, 666 P.2d at 174.
 
The Family Court first considered whether Richard's
 
reason for bringing the motion was "such as to justify relief." 
Concluding that it did not, the Family Court held that:
 
12. Rule 60(b)(6), Hawai' i Family Court Rules
does not authorize the Family Court to amend a divorce
settlement simply by reason of a subsequent change inthe law. "[S]omething more than a 'mere' change inthe law is necessary to provide the grounds for Rule60(b)(6) relief." Hammon v. Monsef, 8 Haw. App. 58,
64 (1990) quoting Ritter v. Smith, 811 F.2d 1398, 1401(11th Cir. 1987)[.] 
13. The National Defense Authorization Act for 
Fiscal Year 2004 that Mr. CARSTENSEN makes [sic]prospective changes (not retrospective) changes [sic]in the law. A prospective change in law is not asufficient reason to justify amending the terms of adivorce pursuant to Rule 60(b)(6), Hawai' i Family
Court Rules. 
Neither Ritter nor Hammon, however, support the
 
conclusion reached in the instant case.6 In Ritter, the
 
Appellant argued that a supervening change in the law could never

 This court in Hammon, although incorporating the quotation from
Ritter that "something more than a 'mere' change in the law is necessary to
provide the grounds for Rule 60(b)(6) relief[,]" denied wife's motion, largely
because she withdrew her timely-filed appeal from the underlying judgment
which would have provided her an opportunity for the relief subsequently
requested by the motion. Hammon, 8 Haw. App. at 64, 792 P.2d at 314 ("'A
party remains under a duty to take legal steps to protect [her] own interests.
In particular, it ordinarily is not permissible to use this motion to remedy a
failure to take an appeal.' W

§ 2864 (1973).") .

present a sufficient basis for relief under FRCP Rule 60(b)(6). 
811 F.2d at 1401. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals
 disagreed, noting that it had previously allowed Rule 60(b)(6)
 relief where there has been a "clear-cut change in the law." 
Rather, the court explained that "a change in the law will not
 always provide the truly extraordinary circumstances necessary to
 reopen a case." Id. Although the court stated that "something
 
more than a 'mere' change in the law is necessary to provide the
 grounds for Rule 60(b)(6) relief[,]" the court found that
 "something more" in the fact – present here as well – that the
 court's previous judgment had not been executed.
7 Id.
 
The Ritter court explicitly noted the different
 
treatment accorded to past effects versus future implications. 
"Generally courts have refused to undo the past, executed effects
 of the judgments, but they have, almost uniformly, recognized
 that it would be unjust to give prospective effect to a judgment
 now known to be improper. Thus, they have granted prospective
 60(b)(6) relief." Id. at 1402.
 
Richard presented both a "clear-cut change in the law"
 
and "something more than a 'mere change' in the law" in support
 of his Rule 60(b) Motion. As such, and without determining
 whether HFCR Rule 60(b)(6) relief was warranted or considering
 whether Richard's Rule 60(b) Motion was timely, the Family Court
 erred in concluding that relief was unavailable under HFCR Rule
 60(b)(6) for the reasons stated.
 
C.	 Whether taking more than three years to file a Rule
60(b) Motion was unreasonable under the circumstances
is not resolved by Greene, but must be determined in
light of all the attendant circumstances.
 
The Family Court denied Richard's HFCR Rule 60(b)
 
Motion, in part, because it found the motion to be untimely.
 
7/
 The Eleventh Circuit found two other factors relevant: (1) "the
fact that there was only minimal delay between the finality of the judgment
and the motion for Rule 60(b)(6) relief[,]" and (2) the close relationship
between the two cases at issue. Ritter, 811 F.2d at 1402. The Family Court's
conclusion that Richard's delay in bringing his Rule 60(b) Motion was
unreasonable is addressed in the following section.
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
14. A delay of more than two (2) years in filing a
motion pursuant to Rule 60(b)(6), Hawai' i Family Court Rules
based on a change in federal law regarding the division of
military retired pay is an unjustified delay. Greene v. 
Greene, 8 Haw. App. 559, 570 [sic] (1991). 
15. Mr. CARSTENSEN's failure to file a motion seeking
to amend the terms of the Agreement Incident to Divorce and
the Decree for over three (3) years after the change in
federal law is an unjustifiable delay.
 
Both HFCR Rules 60(b)(5) and (6) require that motions
 
be brought "within a reasonable time." "[W]hat constitutes a
 
'reasonable time' is determined in the light of all attendant
 circumstances, intervening rights, loss of evidence, prejudice to
 the adverse party, the commanding equities of the case, and the
 general policy that judgments be final. 7 Moore's Federal
 Practice ¶ 60.27[3] (2d ed. 1982); 11 Wright & Miller, Federal
 Practice and Procedure: Civil § 2866 (1973)." Greene, 8 Haw.
 
App. at 568-69, 815 P.2d at 32 (quoting Hayashi, 4 Haw. App. at
 290-91, 666 P.2d at 175)).
 
In finding the motion to be untimely, the Family Court 
relied at least in part on this court's decision in Greene. In light of the Hawai' i Supreme Court's ruling in Riethbrock v. 
Lange, No. SCWC-28289, 2012 WL 3206339 (Haw. March 16, 2012), however, that reliance was misplaced. 
Although we concluded in Greene that Hawaii Revised
 
Statues ("HRS") § 580-56(d) did not divest the family court of
 jurisdiction to decide HFCR Rule 60(b) motions, 8 Haw. App. at
 567-69, 815 P.2d at 31-32, we also held that:
 
In divorce cases where the HFCR Rule 60(b)(6) motion
relates to the division of property, the additional impact
of HRS § 580-56(d)'s express legislative policy in favor of
the finality of judgments and decrees must be considered.
The maximum period of time HRS § 580-56(d) allows the family
court to retain jurisdiction to divide the property is one
year after the divorce decree is entered. It follows that,
absent extraordinary compelling circumstances, a party
should not be allowed more than one year after the time she
knows or should know of her right to seek a change of the
division of property in which to initiate her request for a
change.
 
Id. at 569, 815 P.2d at 32. The principle at the heart of that
 
conclusion, the one year retention of jurisdiction, follows
 directly from Boulton v. Boulton, 69 Haw. 1, 4-5, 730 P.2d 338,
 340 (1986). In Riethbrock, however, the supreme court expressly
 
9
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
overruled Boulton and held that HRS § 580-56(d) does not limit
 
the family court's jurisdiction to divide the property at issue. 
Riethbrock, No. SCWC-28289, 2012 WL 3206339, *18. 
Because Riethbrock determines that the family court's
 
post-decree jurisdiction over the distribution of property is not
 limited under the circumstances, Greene's requirement that a
 court consider this limitation in determining the timeliness of a
 motion is no longer applicable. Therefore, the Family Court
 erred in determining that Richard's HFCR Rule 60(b) Motion was
 untimely inasmuch as it relied upon Greene in reaching its
 conclusion.
 
Under the analogous Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 
Rule 60(b)(5), "court[s are] more willing to grant relief if the judgment still is prospective, so that relief from it does not require unscrambling of the past and no rights of third parties are involved." W
RIGHT ET AL ., supra. The very nature of 
retirement benefits, which are paid out over time for the life of the beneficiary, creates a problem in their effective division and distribution upon the entry of a divorce decree. Although the distribution of these benefits has been treated as property division, the prospective and continuing nature of these payments can be construed as maintenance and support rather than mere division of property. See Carroll v. Nagatori-Carroll, 90 
Hawai'i 376, 382, 978 P.2d 814, 820 (1999) ("Looking at the 
substance of the Divorce Decree in the present case, the amounts that Carroll owed ex-wife do not easily fit within any traditional description of 'property division.'"); see also In re Marriage of Ash, 658 P.2d 540, 541 (Or. Ct. App. 1983) ("In determining whether an award is a division of property or spousal support, the label given it in the decree is not conclusive."). 
The nature of such a provision dividing the future
 
stream of income from a retirement plan weighs in favor of a
 liberal construction of timeliness especially when the party
 seeking relief seeks to modify the future payment, rather than
 past payments, under the provision. See Ind. Family & Soc.
 
Servs. Admin. v. Hospitality House of Bedford, 704 N.E.2d 1050,
 1061 (Ind. Ct. App. 1998) ("A prospective judgment allowed
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
stability and certainty. Conversely, a prospective judgment may
 
become faulty when the law upon which it is based is altered. 
The parties and the court contemplated monitoring and revising
 the order to maintain the proper procedures under the current
 versions of the regulations. Even absent the reserved ability to
 reexamine the order as found in this case, [Rule] 60(B)(7)
 explicitly allows parties to request such review of prospective
 orders which become inequitable.").
8
 
The Family Court's express reservation of jurisdiction
 
over the distribution of Richard's retirement pay bears on this
 final issue as well. The Decree's reservation of jurisdiction
 recognizes both the continuing nature of the obligation created
 under the Decree to make payments and the dynamic nature of the
 federal law concerning military retirement benefits. This
 reservation weighs against finality of the Decree with regard to
 the prospective distribution of Richard's retirement pay.
 
Nevertheless, we do not determine here whether the
 
Family Court erred in concluding that Richard delayed
 unjustifiably in filing his HFCR Rule 60(b) Motion. Rather we
 observe that the Family Court's reliance on Greene in coming to
 its earlier conclusion was unwarranted and remand the case to the
 Family Court for its reconsideration of that issue in light of
 Riethbrock and the other principles enunciated herein, as well as
 the exercise of its discretion with regard to the relief
 
8/
 Indiana's Rule 60(B)(7) discussed in Hospitality House is
 
substantially similar to HFCR Rule 60(b)(5). Specifically, the rule provides:
 
On motion and upon such terms as are just the court may
relieve a party or his legal representative from an entry of
default, final order, or final judgment, including a
judgment by default, for the following reasons:
 
. . . . 
(7) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or
discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based
has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or its is no
longer equitable that the judgment should have
prospective application[.]

 Although the Family Court concluded that its intent in issuing the
Decree, rather than the parties' intent, was controlling, it failed to
determine what it intended regarding the division of Richard's Retired Pay in
the Decree. On remand, the Family Court shall make specific findings with
respect to that issue.
