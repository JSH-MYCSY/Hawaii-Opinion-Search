This appeal concerns a dispute between the Firm and
 
Third-Party Defendant-Appellee Stanford H. Masui (Masui), who
 
previously maintained a law practice with members of the Firm and
 
who continues to represent Plaintiff-Appellee Esther J. Buscher
 
(Buscher), regarding costs advanced on Buscher's behalf.
 
Defendants/Third-Party Plaintiffs-Appellees Duane S. 
Boning; Commerce Insurance Co.; Avis Rent-a-Car System, Inc.; 
Crawford & Co. (collectively, Defendants) assert that their only 
interest in this case is a clear directive as to whom an award of 
costs ordered by the Hawai 'i Supreme Court in Buscher v. Boning, 
114 Hawai 'i 202, 159 P.3d 814 (2007), should be paid. 
The State of Hawai 'i is a nominal appellee as defined 
in Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 2.1 and, 
pursuant to HRAP Rule 28(c), did not provide a brief. 
On appeal, the Firm contends the circuit court erred
 
(1) in finding that the Firm's September 14, 2007 Motion for 
Leave to Intervene (Motion to Intervene) was untimely, (2) in 
finding that the Firm's Motion to Intervene pursued recovery 
costs not the subject of the action, (3) by denying the Firm 
permissive intervention under Hawai 'i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP) Rule 24(b); and (4) in finding the Firm lacked standing by denying the Firm's October 18, 2007 "Motion to Amend the Order on 
Costs Filed June 1, 2005 and to Enforce Attorneys' Lien Filed 
October 4, 2007" (Motion to Amend Costs). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude the
 
Firm's appeal is without merit.
 
Motions to intervene are governed by HRCP Rule 24,
 
which provides in relevant part: 
(a) Intervention of Right.  Upon timely application
anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action . . .
(2) when the applicant claims an interest relating to the
property or transaction which is the subject of the action
and the applicant is so situated that the disposition of the
action may as a practical matter impair or impede the
applicant's ability to protect that interest, unless the
applicant's interest is adequately represented by existing
parties.
 
(b) Permissive Intervention.  Upon timely
application anyone may be permitted to intervene in an
action . . . (2) when an applicant's claim or defense and
the main action have a question of law or fact in common.
. . . In exercising its discretion the court shall consider
whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the
adjudication of the rights of the original parties.
 
The Firm argued below that intervention should have been allowed
 
under either subsection (a) or (b).
 
To determine whether a proposed intervenor has a right
 
to intervene under Rule 24(a), the court considers:
 
a) whether the application was timely; b) whether the
applicants claimed an interest relating to the property or
transaction which was the subject of the action; c) whether
the disposition of the action would, as a practical matter,
impair or impede the applicants' ability to protect that
interest; and d) whether the applicants' interest was
inadequately represented by the existing defendants.
 
Baehr v. Miike, 80 Hawai 'i 341, 343, 910 P.2d 112, 114 (1996) 
(brackets omitted) (quoting Ing v. Acceptance Ins. Co., 76 
Hawai'i 266, 271, 874 P.2d 1091, 1096 (1994)). "Because the 
requirements of intervention by right are stated in the conjunctive it is necessary for Applicants to meet all four 
criteria set forth in Ing. Failure to meet even one prevents 
intervention 'by right' under HRCP Rule 24(a)(2)." Baehr, 80 
Hawai
'i at 345, 910 P.2d at 116. 
The Firm's first point of error is that the circuit
 
court abused its discretion when it found that the Motion to
 Intervene was untimely. In evaluating the timeliness of a motion
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to intervene, the court must consider "the totality of 
circumstances, but especially relevant is: (1) the lapse of time 
between when [the proposed intervenor] should have sought 
intervention and when it actually did; and (2) the prejudice 
caused to the [parties] by the lapse of time." Ing, 76 Hawai 'i 
at 271, 874 P.2d at 1096. "Since the requirement of timeliness is a flexible one, much must necessarily be left to the sound 
discretion of the court." Blackfield Hawaii Corp. v. Travelodge 
Int'l, Inc., 3 Haw. App. 61, 63, 641 P.2d 981, 983 (1982) (quoting 7A Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal 
Practice and Procedure, ยง 1916 at 572 (1972)). Without 
explaining the circumstances it considered, the circuit court 
concluded that the motion was untimely. 
The Firm argues that the motion was timely because it 
was filed within two months after the Firm learned of the Hawai
'i 
Supreme Court decision and after it was "on notice [that] no party in the case would protect its interest in obtaining and 
enforcing an amended bill of costs." The Firm relies on Sierra 
Club v. Espy, 18 F.3d 1202, 1206 (5th Cir. 1994), in which the 
United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit stated that 
"[a] better gauge of promptness is the speed with which the 
would-be intervenor acted when it became aware that its interests 
would no longer be protected by the original parties." 
Hawai
'i law, however, provides that "the relevant date 
is not when the proposed intervenor had actual knowledge of its 
interests in the action; rather, the relevant date is when the 
proposed intervenor knew or reasonably should have known of its 
interest in the action." Garner v. State Dep't of Educ., 122 
Hawai'i 150, 166-67, 223 P.3d 215, 231-32 (App. 2009) (internal 
quotation marks, citation, and emphasis omitted). 
The Firm could have known that its interest in any
 
future recovery by Buscher would be impaired when Masui left the
 
practice in December 2005 and certainly should have known no
 
later than May 1, 2006, when the Firm was formally replaced by
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Masui as counsel for Buscher. We can infer that the circuit 
court concluded as much from its reference to Carroll v. 
Miyashiro, 50 Haw. 413, 441 P.2d 638 (1968). In Carroll, the 
Hawai'i Supreme Court held that the substitution of an attorney 
"should be conditioned upon immediate reimbursement by plaintiff to [the discharged attorney] of the latter's advance of court 
costs and protection of [the discharged attorney] in the payment 
of his fee" in the form of a charging lien upon the plaintiff's 
recovery. Id. at 414, 441 P.2d at 639. 
The Firm moved to intervene almost 16 months after the 
Firm withdrew and Masui substituted in as counsel. In Blackfield 
Hawaii, 3 Haw. App. at 62-63, 641 P.2d at 982-83, this court 
found that a motion to intervene was untimely where its filing 
was delayed approximately 16 months. Therefore, the circuit 
court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the Firm's 
Motion to Intervene was untimely. Because the Firm failed to 
prove its Motion to Intervene was timely, the circuit court was 
not required to allow intervention under HRCP Rule 24(a). See 
Baehr, 80 Hawai
'i at 345, 910 P.2d at 116. 
Furthermore, the Firm was not prejudiced by the denial
 
of the Motion to Intervene. The Wisconsin Court of Appeals in
 Olivarez v. Unitrin Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co., 723 N.W.2d 131 (Wis.
 
Ct. App. 2006), examined the issue of prejudice to a law firm
 
moving to intervene in a former client's case. The law firm,
 
which had employed the plaintiff's attorney when he began
 
representing the former client, moved to intervene so as to
 
enforce an attorney's lien shortly before the court was to enter
 
judgment dismissing the case pursuant to a settlement. 723
 
N.W.2d at 134. The trial court rejected the law firm's
 
intervention, reasoning that
 
if a party seeking intervention will be left with the right
to pursue an independent remedy against the parties in the
primary proceeding, regardless of the outcome of the pending
case, then the party has no interest that needs protecting
by intervention of right. It is only where the interest is
in the same subject matter that the effect of other remedies
is immaterial to intervention.
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Id. at 140 (quoting 59 Am. Jur. 2d Parties ยง 185 (2002)). The
 
court stated that because the former law firm had a right to
 
pursue "an independent remedy," it did not have an "interest that
 
needs protecting by intervention of right." Olivarez, 723 N.W.2d
 
at 140.
 
In the instant case, the Firm was not prejudiced by the 
denial of intervention because it could have pursued another remedy -- a separate action against Buscher. Bacerra v. 
MacMillan, 111 Hawai
'i 117, 120, 138 P.3d 749, 752 (2006), 
clearly stands for the proposition that an entity that holds a 
lien on a judgment can enforce that lien through an independent 
action. See also Skelton v. Spencer, 625 P.2d 1072, 1076 (Idaho 
1981). An independent action would have also served to speed up the resolution of the case between Buscher and Defendants, by not 
involving the circuit court in the attorneys' dispute over the 
amount of costs that the Firm was entitled to recoup (if any) 
under its purported lien. 
The Firm argues that if intervention as of right was 
not appropriate, then the circuit court had discretion under HRCP 
Rule 24(b) to permit intervention and erred in not doing so. 
However, "the trial court's discretion under Rule 24(b)(2) is 
very broad." Baehr, 80 Hawai
'i at 345, 910 P.2d at 116 (internal 
quotation marks, citation, and brackets omitted). "In fact, a denial of permissive intervention has virtually never been 
reversed." Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
The Firm fails to present a compelling argument for how the circuit court abused its discretion in denying the motion to 
intervene. 
Timeliness is required to grant permissive
 
intervention, as it is for a grant of intervention of right. See
 
7C Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, & Mary Kay Kane,
 Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 3d ยง 1916 (2007). As noted
 
above, the circuit court found the Firm's request to intervene
 
untimely, a finding we will not disturb on appeal. The circuit
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
court could not grant permissive intervention where the request
 
to intervene was untimely. We will not reverse its decision. 
The Firm conceded in the December 4, 2007 hearing on 
its Motion to Amend Costs that if the Firm was not allowed to 
intervene, it would not be a party to the action and therefore 
lack standing. Given that the circuit court's refusal to allow 
the Firm to intervene was not erroneous, the Firm was rightly 
denied party status and therefore lacked standing to bring a 
motion before the circuit court. See Bacerra, 111 Hawai 'i at 
120, 138 P.3d at 752. Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in denying the Firm's Motion to Amend Costs. 
Therefore,
 The circuit court's denial of the Firm's motion to
 
intervene and subsequent motions were not an abuse of discretion. 
Therefore, the "Order Denying Takahashi Vasconcellos & Covert's
 
Motion for Leave to Intervene," filed on October 17, 2007; the 
"Order Denying Takahashi Vasconcellos & Covert's Motion for
 
Reconsideration on Order Denying Takahashi Vasconcellos &
 
Covert's Motion for Leave to Intervene," filed on December 7,
 
2007; and the "Order Denying Takahashi Vasconcellos & Covert's
 
Motion to Amend the Order on Costs Filed June 1, 2005 and to
 
Enforce Attorney's Lien Filed October 4, 2007," filed on
 
December 18, 2007, are affirmed.
