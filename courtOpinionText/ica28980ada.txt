from the December 26, 2007 Judgment entered by the Circuit Court
 
of the Second Circuit (Circuit Court) on: (1) an Order Denying
 
Motion to Vacate Arbitration Award and for Fees and Costs; and
 
(2) an Order Confirming Arbitration Award.1/ The Circuit Court

 basis of fraud and confirmed the arbitration award in favor of
 
Plaintiff-Appellee David T. Low (Low).

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal, Minichino maintains that the Circuit Court
 
erred in failing to vacate the award for fraud, or violation of
 
public policy, resulting from Low's alleged perjury at the
 
arbitration hearing. In the alternative, she contends that the
 
court erred in failing to grant an evidentiary hearing concerning
 
the allegation of fraud. We conclude that because Minichino
 
presented evidence establishing a prima facie case of fraud, the
 
Circuit Court erred in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing and
 
failing to issue findings of fact and conclusions of law.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
This dispute arises out of Minichino's cancellation of
 
a real property purchase agreement (Deposit Receipt Offer and
 
Acceptance or DROA). On May 26, 2002, Minichino, a licensed
 
realtor, entered into a DROA to purchase residential property
 
from Low. The DROA contained a financing contingency allowing
 
Minichino to terminate the contract on or before June 25, 2002,
 
if she was unable to secure financing for the purchase. Under
 
the DROA, if a party elected to terminate the contract, then "(a)
 
Buyer or Seller shall promptly execute all cancellation documents
 
requested by Escrow; and (b) Escrow shall return to Buyer all
 
deposits previously made, less the amount of any escrow expenses
 
or fees chargeable to Buyer." It further provided, "Any
 
termination shall be in writing and delivered to Escrow to be
 
effective."
 
Minichino was unable to secure financing to purchase
 
the property as she apparently did not qualify for the requisite
 
mortgage. On June 20, 2002, Minichino purchased a different,
 
less-expensive, residential property. 
On February 12, 2004, Low filed the complaint herein
 
alleging that Minichino breached the DROA by failing to purchase
 
the property. The Circuit Court compelled binding arbitration
 
pursuant to the terms of the DROA. 
2
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
After a November 3, 2006 hearing, on May 7, 2007, the
 
arbitrator issued an award in favor of Low. The arbitrator found
 
that Minichino did not advise Low of her desire to cancel the
 
DROA until "sometime after July 24, 2002, at or near the time of
 
the scheduled closing." He concluded:
 
. . . .
 
2. As a licensed realtor, Defendant would have the requisite
knowledge and experience to terminate a purchase, should it
become apparent that she could not obtain the financing she
required to complete the purchase. Those procedures are
contained in the DROA (par. C20-21).
 
3. The Plaintiff relied upon the Defendant's status as a
licensed realtor in allowing her to draft the DROA and
complete the purchase.
 
4. Rather than keep the Plaintiff advised of the
difficulties she was having in completing financing, there
is no evidence that Defendant communicated with Plaintiff,
or even attempted to communicate, those difficulties. She
 did not ask for an extension of closing, in writing.
 
5. There is no evidence that the Defendant availed herself
 
of the termination provisions contained in the DROA, or gave
Plaintiff any notice of her intent not to purchase the
Property.
 
6. Instead, Plaintiff was left with the understanding that
the Defendant was continuing with her efforts to complete
the purchase of the Property, and he gave her additional
time.
 
7. In the meantime, Defendant purchased a less expensive
property in Paia.
 
8. Defendant testified that she could not recall many of the
events regarding the purchase of the property. She did not
 recall receiving service of process for the instant action.
Because of such testimony, the Arbitrator find[s] much of
the Defendant's testimony not credible.
 
9. While Defendant did not qualify for the loan required to
complete the purchase, because of her failure to keep
Plaintiff appraised of the status of her failed efforts to
clear her credit report; his ongoing reliance on her efforts
to obtain financing; and her failure to give notice of
termination, Defendant is estopped from asserting the failed
financing contingency.
 
10. Defendant's action[s] place her in breach of the DROA.
 
The arbitrator awarded Low damages, attorney's fees, and costs
 
totaling $83,964.70.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
On May 11, 2007, Low filed a motion to confirm the
 
arbitration award. On August 3, 2007, Minichino filed a motion
 
to vacate the award on the ground that it had been procured by
 
fraud -- namely, Low's perjured testimony. In a declaration, she
 
attested that at the arbitration hearing, she testified that she
 
gave both oral and written notice, via email, to Low terminating
 
the DROA but Low gave contrary testimony. She further averred
 
that she had been previously unable to locate copies of the e-
mails due to extensive flood damage to her files and computer
 
hard drive, when her residence flooded on December 31, 2004, and
 
again on October 16, 2006. Low allegedly "lied" at the
 
arbitration, testifying that no such e-mails had been sent to
 
him. Low did not submit any sworn statement in the Circuit Court
 
proceeding.
 
After entry of the arbitration award, Minichino was
 
able to locate copies of the e-mails she had sent to Low. The e-
mails, dated from June 21 to 23, 2002, state Minichino's
 
inability to secure financing and her cancellation of the DROA.2/
 
2/
 An email from Minichino to Low, dated June 21, 2002, states in
full:
 
Please try to be reasonable and understand that my
cancellation of the Droa [sic] is out of my hands. This is
 for your benefit and enables you to sell the home to your
backup offers. I understand you are upset, I had school
plans for my son. I cannot get the loan needed to buy your
home. Can you understand this is for your benefit to move
 on. Becky [the loan officer] tried but got only 1/2 the
amount of the loan approved. Swearing and screaming at me
does not change what occurred here. We agreed I could not
get an extention [sic] if the lender did not request it and
she cannot. She cannot get me the loan. Call your backups
tonight and get an escrow open, use my appraisal and
inspections and get your home closed. If I could do
 something different I would. She tried several lenders and
 she cannot get the loan I need to close on your house.
Please stop calling me and screaming at me. There is
 nothing else I can do. I am as sad as you are about [sic].
You must accept my cancellation of the droa [sic] and move
on so you can move to your fiancee. Please call Becky and
confirm the loan amount I can get. You have her info.

They urge Low to stop threatening and harassing Minichino for her
 
inability to complete the transaction. In support of her motion,
 
Minichino also submitted extensive documentation of the flood
 
damage to her property, including damage to her computer. 
In the Circuit Court proceedings, Low did not deny his
 
alleged testimony at the arbitration hearing, nor did he deny
 
that he received the e-mails. However, his attorney attested
 
that "at no time during the [arbitration] hearing did the
 
Defendant mention that her evidence was lost because of [a]
 
flood, nor did she make any request for adjournment of the
 
hearing to allow her to look for the evidence." Low objected to
 
the e-mails on the basis that Minichino had ample time to
 
discover any such evidence during arbitration. He argued that
 
Minichino waived any right to introduce new evidence by failing
 
to request a postponement during arbitration to locate the e-
mails. 
At the hearing on the motion to vacate, the Circuit
 
Court concluded that Minichino failed to establish fraud. The
 
court denied Minichino's request to hold an evidentiary hearing. 
On December 26, 2007, the court issued orders confirming the
 
award, denying Minichino's motion to vacate, and entered final
 
judgment. Minichino timely filed a notice of appeal.
 
II. POINTS OF ERROR
 
Minichino asserts the following points of error on

circuit court's review of arbitral awards must be extremely
 
3/
 This statute provides, in relevant part:
 
§ 658A-23 Vacating award. (a) Upon motion to the
court by a party to an arbitration proceeding, the court
shall vacate an award made in the arbitration proceeding if:
(1) 	The award was procured by corruption, fraud, or
other undue means;
(2) 	There was:
 (A) 	Evident partiality by an arbitrator
appointed as a neutral arbitrator;
(B) 	Corruption by an arbitrator; or
(C) 	Misconduct by an arbitrator prejudicing
the rights of a party to the arbitration
proceeding;
(3) An arbitrator refused to postpone the hearing upon
showing of sufficient cause for postponement, refused
to consider evidence material to the controversy, or
otherwise conducted the hearing contrary to section
658A-15, so as to prejudice substantially the rights
of a party to the arbitration proceeding;
 . . . .
 (c) If the court vacates an award on a ground other
than that set forth in subsection (a)(5), it may order a
rehearing. If the award is vacated on a ground stated in
subsection (a)(1) or (2), the rehearing shall be before a
new arbitrator. If the award is vacated on a ground stated
in subsection (a)(3), (4), or (6), the rehearing may be
before the arbitrator who made the award or the arbitrator's
 successor. The arbitrator shall render the decision in the
 rehearing within the same time as that provided in section
658A-19(b) for an award.

narrow and exceedingly deferential." Tatibouet v. Ellsworth, 99
 
Hawai'i 226, 233, 54 P.3d 397, 404 (2002) (internal quotation 
marks, citations, and brackets omitted).
 
Arbitration awards are entitled to considerable
 
deference for the following reasons:
 
First, because of the legislative policy to encourage
arbitration and thereby discourage litigation, arbitrators
have broad discretion in resolving the dispute. Upon
submission of an issue, the arbitrator has authority to
determine the entire question, including the legal
construction of terms of a contract or lease, as well as the
disputed facts. In fact, where the parties agree to
arbitrate, they thereby assume all the hazards of the
arbitration process, including the risk that the arbitrators
may make mistakes in the application of law and in their
findings of fact. 
Second, correlatively, judicial review of an
arbitration award is confined to the strictest possible
limits. An arbitration award may be vacated only on the
four grounds specified in HRS § 658-9 and modified and
corrected only on the three grounds specified in HRS
§ 658-10. Moreover, the courts have no business weighing
the merits of the award. 
Schmidt v. Pac. Benefit Servs., Inc., 113 Hawai' i 161, 165-66, 
150 P.3d 810, 814-15 (2006) (citation omitted). This narrow and 
deferential review applies equally to arbitration awards subject 
to HRS § 658A. See, e.g., Mikelson v. United Servs. Auto. Ass'n, 
122 Hawai' i 393, 395-96, 227 P.3d 559, 560-61 (App. 2010) 
(citations omitted). 
IV. DISCUSSION
 
A. Grounds for Vacating the Arbitration Award
 
Minichino argues that the award was procured by fraud
 
because the arbitrator's resolution of a central issue -- whether
 she provided Low with written notice of her cancellation -­
turned on Low's allegedly perjured testimony. Her argument
 
requires us to analyze the scope of the statute mandating vacatur
 
of arbitral awards for fraud. HRS § 658A-23(a)(1).
 
As noted above, judicial review of arbitration awards
 
is confined to the "strictest possible limits." Mars
 
Constructors, Inc. v. Tropical Enters., Ltd., 51 Haw. 332, 335,
 
7
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
460 P.2d 317, 319 (1969). This limited review derives from 
"legislative policy to encourage arbitration and thereby 
discourage litigation." Tatibouet, 99 Hawai' i at 233, 54 P.3d at 
404 (internal quotation marks, brackets, and citation omitted). 
In general, courts may not review the merits of an 
arbitration award or overturn an award on the basis of newly discovered evidence. See Kona Village Realty, Inc. v. Sunstone 
Realty Partners, XIV, LLC, 121 Hawai' i 110, 112-13, 214 P.3d 
1100, 1102-03 (App. 2009). However, Hawai' i's Uniform 
Arbitration Act provides certain grounds for which the court 
"shall vacate" an arbitration award. HRS § 658A-23(a) (emphasis 
added). One such ground is where the "award was procured by 
corruption, fraud, or other undue means." HRS § 658A-23(a)(1). 
Because of the sound policies underlying the finality of 
arbitration awards and limited judicial review, courts must, 
nevertheless, be slow to vacate an arbitration award on the 
ground of fraud. See, e.g., Dogherra v. Safeway Stores, Inc., 
679 F.2d 1293, 1297 (9th Cir. 1982) (holding that obtaining an 
arbitration award by perjured testimony constitutes fraud; 
remanding to district court for determination of whether there 
was clear and convincing evidence of fraud, which went to a 
material issue, and which could not upon the exercise of due 
diligence have been discovered prior to the arbitration). 
Hawai'i courts have not addressed whether perjury in an 
arbitration hearing may constitute fraud sufficient to vacate an 
award. However, in the absence of binding case law, we may look 
to federal courts for guidance. Price v. Obayashi Haw. Corp., 81 
Hawai'i 171, 181, 914 P.2d 1364, 1374 (1996); see also Kay v. 
Kaiser Found. Health Plan, Inc., 119 Hawai' i 219, 226-27, 194 
P.3d 1181, 1188-89 (App. 2008) (discussing approach of federal courts to evident partiality ground for vacatur). 
Low contends that awards may be vacated only for
 
"extrinsic fraud." Because perjury is "intrinsic fraud," he
 
8
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
argues, it is an inadequate basis for vacatur. The
 
extrinsic/intrinsic distinction has arisen in the context of
 
motions for post-judgment or post-arbitration relief based on
 
fraud, misrepresentation, or misconduct. Pac. Crown Distributors
 
v. Bhd. of Teamsters & Auto Truck Drivers, Local 70, 228 Cal.
 Rptr. 645, 650 (Cal. Ct. App. 1986) (applying extrinsic/intrinsic
 
distinction to arbitration award); Pour Le Bebe, Inc. v. Guess?
 
Inc., 5 Cal. Rptr. 3d 442, 457-58 (Cal. Ct. App. 2003)
 
(discussing that courts take a more lenient approach when
 
examining intrinsic fraud in the context of arbitration because
 
parties' procedural rights are limited); MBNA Am. Bank., N.A. v.
 
Garcia, 205 P.3d 53, 56 (Or. Ct. App. 2009) (vacatur of
 
arbitration award limited to extrinsic fraud based on Oregon rule
 
similarly limiting post-relief judgment); Jacobowitz v. Herson,
 
197 N.E. 169, 171 (N.Y. 1935) (precluding attack on arbitration
 
award procured by perjury based on similar treatment of judgments
 
after trial in a court action). Extrinsic fraud occurs when a
 
party unfairly prevents another from obtaining a fair hearing or
 
presenting a full claim or defense. Pour Le Bebe, Inc., 5 Cal.
 
Rptr. 3d at 457. Intrinsic fraud includes perjury, falsified
 evidence, and other false claims or defenses arising during the
 
course of litigation or arbitration. Id. at 458. Due to the
 
nature of the adversary process, some courts reason that a trial
 is generally a party's sole opportunity to confront intrinsic
 
perjury. Id. Parties "must be prepared to meet and expose
 
perjury then and there." Id. (internal quotation marks and
 
citation omitted). The stability of final judgments would be
 
undermined if courts could freely set aside judgments for a
 
party's failure to exert diligent efforts in refuting intrinsic
 
fraud at trial. Id. 
Several jurisdictions, including Hawai' i, have 
abrogated the distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic fraud 
in the context of post-judgment motions for relief based on

Maintaining Default Judgment as Ground for Vacating or Setting
Aside in State Courts, 78 A.L.R.3d 150, § 2A (1977) (noting that
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and several state provisions
patterned after them, have abolished distinction); Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure Rule 60(b)(3).  Post-judgment motions may now
seek relief for both extrinsic and intrinsic fraud, such as
perjury.  Hawai #i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 60(b)(3)
(establishing fraud, "whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or
extrinsic," as ground for post-judgment relief); see, e.g.,
Kawamata Farms, Inc. v. United Agri Products, 86 Hawai #i 214,
255-57, 948 P.2d 1055, 1096-98 (1997) (setting aside judgment
based on discovery fraud).
The policy considerations underlying the "extrinsic
fraud" rule have little application in the context of arbitration
awards.  Pour Le Bebe , 5 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 458.   Arbitration
affords far fewer procedural protections than civil litigation. 
Id.  Due to the lack of extensive discovery or appeal, applying
the "extrinsic fraud" rule to arbitration awards would nearly
vitiate a party's ability to vacate an award for fraud.  Id.  The
plain language of HRS § 658A-23(a)(1) does not limit "fraud" to
that of an extrinsic nature.
A number of state and federal courts, interpreting
provisions identical to HRS § 658A-23(a), have recognized that
perjury may constitute fraud sufficient to vacate an award.  See,
e.g., Dogherra, 679 F.2d at 1297 ("Obtaining an award by perjured
testimony constitutes fraud.").4/  Courts have widely adopted aFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

6/As discussed below, the Hawai# i Arbitration Act, like the federal
arbitration statute, requires that the party seeking vacatur of an arbitration
award, based on fraud, demonstrate that the award was procured by fraud.  See
HRS § 658A-23(a)(1). Some courts have distinguished or criticized Bonar for
its formulation of this third element (see, e.g., Thomas Kinkade v. Hazelwood,
2007 WL 2088584 (N.D.Cal. 2007)) and, in our discussion of this element, we
have attempted to provide a clear standard which does not quote Bonar
verbatim.  However, given the deference that Hawai# i courts give to an
arbitration award, even if the arbitrator commits a legal error or bases the
award on clearly erroneous facts, it appears that it would be virtually
impossible to demonstrate that the outcome of an arbitration would have been
different had the fraud not occurred. 
 See, e.g., Tatibouet, 99 Hawai# i at
236, 54 P.3d at 407.  Thus, we recognize the rigorous standard of proof of
clear and convincing evidence of fraud, and require that the fraud be material
(continued...)
11three-pronged test for determining when fraud constitutes a basis
for vacating an award.  Bonar v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 835
F.2d 1378, 1383 (11th Cir. 1988).5/  First, the movant must
establish the fraud by clear and convincing evidence.  Second,
the fraud must not have been discoverable, upon the exercise of
due diligence, prior to or during arbitration.  Third, the movant
must demonstrate that the fraud had a material effect on a
dispositive issue in the arbitration.  Bonar, 835 F.2d at 1383;
Dogherra , 679 F.2d at 1297.6/  "In the absence of a prima facieFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

to and have a substantial and causative effect on a dispositive issue, but we
decline to state this element in absolutist terms.  That said, under the
procured-by-fraud standard, if a reviewing court determines that the
arbitration award may be construed to be grounded in other, non-fraudulent,
evidence, the motion to vacate must be denied.
12showing with respect to these factors, the court is not empowered
to assess evidence, much less new evidence that was not timely
submitted to the arbitrators, in responding to a request for
vacatur."  Seattle Packaging Corp.,  972 P.2d at 579.
These elements ensure that the various policies
underlying finality of arbitration awards and limited judicial
review will not be eroded.  By requiring clear and convincing
evidence, the Bonar test places a high burden upon the movant to
establish fraud.  Courts may not vacate an award for mere
inconsistencies in testimony.  See id. at 581-83.  Where the
alleged fraud is based on perjured testimony, the movant must
establish that the witness "wilfully, knowingly, and falsely"
stated some material fact under oath.  Territory v. Kaahanui, 29
Haw. 827, 829 (Haw. Terr. 1927).  Testimony that reflects an
opinion or approximation as well as testimony that is not
willfully false will not give rise to a potential ground for
vacatur.  Fleming,  158 P.3d at 1113.
The second element prevents the movant from taking a
"second bite at the apple" if the fraud could have been
discovered at arbitration.  A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc. v.
McCollough, 967 F.2d 1401, 1404 (9th Cir. 1992).  If the movant
could have rebutted the adversary's claims or evidence at
arbitration, the scales will tip in favor of preserving the
award's finality.  Karaha Bodas Co., 364 F.3d at 307; Karppinen,
187 F.2d at 35.  Similarly, courts may not vacate an award if the
arbitrator fully considered the parties' evidence and arguments
regarding the alleged fraud.  A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc., 967 F.2d

should not vacate the arbitration award if the movant presented
 
the evidence of perjury to the arbitrators"). A challenge on the
 
basis of fraud therefore cannot amount to a mere attack on the
 
arbitrator's credibility determination. 
Finally, the third element of the Bonar test limits
 
vacatur to cases where the award was "procured by . . . fraud." 
HRS § 658A-23(a)(1) (emphasis added); see also Crye-Leike, Inc.
 
v. Thomas, 196 F. Supp. 2d 680, 685 (W.D. Tenn. 2002)
 
(interpreting identical provision of Federal Arbitration Act). 
The movant must demonstrate a nexus between the alleged fraud and
 
the arbitral outcome. Pour Le Bebe, 5 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 462. 
Where fraud concerns only a minor or collateral issue that did
 not influence the arbitrator's decision, it is insufficient to
 
support a vacatur. Forsythe Int'l, S.A. v. Gibbs Oil Co. of
 
Texas, 915 F.2d 1017, 1022 (5th Cir. 1990) ("where the
 
[arbitration] panel hears the allegation of fraud and then rests
 
its decision on grounds clearly independent of issues connected
 
to the alleged fraud, the statutory basis for vacatur is
 
absent"); see also Peabody v. Rotan Mosle, Inc., 677 F. Supp.
 
1135, 1137-38 (M.D. Fla. 1987) (insufficient nexus where perjured
 
testimony related to minor issue and did not affect outcome).
 
Because arbitrators are generally not required to state their
 
reasons for the award, the burden is on the movant to demonstrate
 
that the fraud was material to the arbitration award. See R. D.
 
Hursh, Necessity that Arbitrators, in Making Award, Make Specific
 or Detailed Findings of Fact or Conclusions of Law, 82 A.L.R.2d
 
969, § 2[a] (1962) ("It seems established beyond peradventure
 
that . . . an arbitration award need not recite the arbitrator's
 
findings of fact or conclusions of law."); A.G. Edwards & Sons,
 
Inc., 967 F.2d at 1403 (noting that courts must presume 
13
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
arbitrators "took a permissible route to the award where one
 
exists"); see also  n.6 above.7/
 
This three-prong test sets a high standard in order to
 
deter motions that merely seek to relitigate issues that were
 
already -- or could have been -- presented to the arbitrator. 
The test therefore preserves the parties' bargain for the
 
judgment of an arbitrator. Morrison-Knudsen Co., Inc. v.
 
Makahuena Corp., 66 Haw. 663, 670, 675 P.2d 760, 766 (1983)
 (parties to arbitration agreement bargained for arbitrator's
 
decision). At the same time, it offers relief for parties whose
 
bargain does not extend to a determination procured by fraud. 
Accordingly, we conclude that, in narrow circumstances
 
articulated above, perjury may constitute a basis for vacating an
 
arbitration award.
 
B.	 As Material Facts Were in Dispute, An Evidentiary
 Hearing Was Required
 
In Clawson v. Habilitat, Inc., 71 Haw. 76, 79, 783 P.2d
 
1230, 1232 (1989), the Hawai' i Supreme Court held that "whenever 
material facts are in dispute in determining whether an 
arbitration award should be vacated, the circuit court should 
conduct an evidentiary hearing and render findings of fact and 
conclusions of law in support of granting or denying the motion 
to vacate the arbitration award." Not every motion to vacate a 
arbitration award, whether based on fraud or otherwise grounded, 
warrants an evidentiary hearing and the entry of findings of fact 
and conclusions of law. Id. In this case, however, as it 
7/
 The three-pronged test is consistent with our approach to vacating
judgments for alleged fraud. See HRCP Rule 60(b)(3). Such fraud may
encompass both extrinsic and intrinsic types. Id. To raise a collateral 
action for fraud upon the court, the movant must (1) prove by clear and
convincing evidence that the verdict was procured by fraud, and (2) establishthat the fraud prevented the movant from fully and fairly presenting his orher case. Kawamata Farms, Inc. v. United Agri Products, 86 Hawai' i 214, 252,
948 P.2d 1055, 1093 (1997). This high burden preserves the finality ofjudgments. Standard Mgmt., Inc. v. Kekona, 98 Hawai' i 95, 99-100, 43 P.3d
232, 236-37 (App. 2001) (recognizing high standard).

appears that Minichino made a prima facie showing that the
 
arbitration award was procured by fraud, and because material
 
issues of fact are unresolved, without proper findings of fact
 
and conclusions of law, we cannot determine whether the Circuit
 
Court erred in denying Minichino's motion. See id. 
As set forth above, to establish the grounds for
 
vacatur, Minichino has the burden to demonstrate: 
(1) clear and
 
convincing evidence of fraud; (2) that the fraud was not
 discoverable, upon the exercise of due diligence, prior to or
 
during the arbitration; and (3) that the fraud was material to
 
and had a substantial and causative effect on a dispositive issue
 
in the arbitration.
 
Minichino presented uncontroverted evidence that, if
 
taken as true, establishes that Low committed fraud by presenting
 
perjured testimony to the arbitrator.

 In Bonar, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that
 
newly discovered evidence of perjury warranted vacating an award. Bonar, 835
 
F.2d at 1384-86. After the arbitration, the losing party discovered that the
opposing party's expert witness had falsified his credentials. Id. at 1381. 
As clear and convincing evidence of perjury, the movant submitted letters and
affidavits confirming that the witness had not graduated from or worked at the
institutions he claimed. Id. at 1384. Because the arbitration rules did not
 
provide for a pre-hearing exchange of witness lists, the movant did not know
the witness would testify until the day of the hearing. Id. The movant could
 
not have uncovered the evidence of perjury earlier. Id. Finally, the court
concluded that if the witness had not falsified his credentials, "it is
extremely doubtful that he would have been permitted to testify as an expert,
and the arbitrators would have heard none of [his] testimony." Id. at 1385.
 
The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has also recognized that an
award may be vacated on the basis of newly discovered evidence of perjury.
United Parcel Serv., 335 F.3d at 503-04. The arbitration involved an
 employee's termination for allegedly physically assaulting another employee.
Id. at 500-01. After the award in favor of the employer, the victim submitted
an affidavit contradicting her previous statement. Id. at 502. Although the
arbitrator did not find that the employee engaged in physical violence, the
court concluded that the perjury was "clearly connected to an issue material
to the arbitration." Id. at 503-04. Because the arbitrator relied heavily on
the victim's testimony, the perjury may have impacted the findings as well as
relief. Id. at 504. However, as the recantation merely contradicted the
witness's own prior testimony, the appellate court declined to find clear and
convincing evidence of fraud on appeal. Id. at 504 n.4. Instead, it remanded
to the district court for a determination of whether the affidavit constituted
 clear and convincing evidence of perjury. Id. at 504.

natural gas facility after he left his post in the middle of a shift, contrary
to safety policies and state and federal regulations.  345 F.3d at 618.  At
the arbitration hearing, the employee testified that he left work because of a
family emergency, and his wife corroborated that testimony.  Id.  The
arbitrator found the employee credible and reinstated him.  Id. at 618-19. 
However, after the award was rendered, MidAmerican received an anonymous tip
that the employee had lied about the family emergency.  Id. at 619.  This lead
culminated in the deposition testimony of a woman who attested she had been
engaged in an extramarital affair with the employee on the night he left his
shift. Id.  On appeal, the court recognized that the woman's deposition
testimony, if credited, would compel the conclusion that the award was
procured by fraud. Id. at 622.  The arbitrator's decision was expressly
premised on his credibility determination of the employee's testimony.  Id. at
622-23.  However, because the evidence merely demonstrated an inconsistency in
testimony, the court remanded for a determination of whether the deposition
constituted clear and convincing evidence of perjury.  Id. at 623; see also

16states, inter alia :  "I testified that I gave both oral and
written notice to the Seller prior to June 25, 2002, but the
Arbitrator accepted the contrary testimony of the seller" and
"[k]nowing that his testimony at the arbitration hearing was
false, [Low] lied before the Arbitrator[.]"  Minichino also
submitted copies of dated emails that appear to evidence or at
least raise a strong inference of Low's alleged perjury regarding
Minichino's notification to Low that she could not obtain the
financing necessary to close the transaction.  Low did not submit
any contrary evidence, and he did not dispute Minichino's
allegation that he testified at the arbitration hearing that
Minichino did not give him notice of termination.  The e-mails
submitted by Minichino would directly contradict any testimony by
Low denying his receipt of notice of termination.  However, as
the Circuit Court did not hold an evidentiary hearing and issued
no findings of fact, we cannot conclude from the limited record
whether Minichino has established fraud by clear and convincing
evidence.9/  
9/At the hearing, the Circuit Court summarily concluded that
Minichino had not established fraud.  However, because the court did not hold
an evidentiary hearing, the factual basis for this conclusion is not clear. FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(...continued)9/
Our inability to clearly discern the basis for the court's ruling supports
requiring an evidentiary hearing and findings of fact, including findings
concerning the alleged perjury in this case.  On remand, at the evidentiary
hearing, both parties will have an opportunity to present evidence and
arguments on all three prongs of the test set forth herein.
17Regarding whether Minichino exercised due diligence in
the discovery of the e-mails, Minichino attested that she had
been unable to previously locate the e-mails because of extensive
flood damage to her property on two occasions prior to the
arbitration, including damage to her computer hard drive and
files.  She submitted documentation of the flood damage.  The
documentation noted damage to a computer.  Although Minichino did
not submit specific testimony as to how she eventually located
the e-mails, her counsel stated at the hearing that he urged her
to "go over and look at the file several more times, including
other files that related theoretically to this transaction, and
she did find one e-mail and two others."   Minichino's evidence
raises an issue of material fact as to whether she could have
located the e-mails, upon the exercise of due diligence, prior to
or during arbitration.
Lastly, Low's allegedly perjured testimony concerned
whether Minichino informed Low of Minichino's inability to secure
financing, an issue that, arguably, was material to the
arbitrator's decision in favor of Low.  As reported above, the
arbitration award states, inter alia :
. . . .
4. Rather than keep the Plaintiff advised of the
difficulties she was having in completing financing, there
is no evidence that Defendant communicated with Plaintiff,
or even attempted to communicate, those difficulties.  She
did not ask for an extension of closing, in writing.
5. There is no evidence that . . . Plaintiff [had] any
notice of [Defendant's] intent not to purchase the
Property.
6. Instead, Plaintiff was left with the understanding that
the Defendant was continuing with her efforts to complete
the purchase of the Property, and he gave her additional
time.FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
. . . .
 
9. While Defendant did not qualify for the loan required to
complete the purchase, because of her failure to keep
Plaintiff appraised of the status of her failed efforts to
clear her credit report; his ongoing reliance on her
efforts to obtain financing; and her failure to give notice
of termination, Defendant is estopped from asserting the
failed financing contingency.
 
The arbitrator expressly grounded his determination
 
that Minichino could not assert her inability to obtain financing
 
as a defense because of "her failure to keep [Low] apprised of
 
the status" of her financing efforts and "[Low's] ongoing
 
reliance on [Minichino's] efforts to obtain financing.10/  Thus,
 
there is prima facie support for the required nexus between the
 
alleged perjury and the arbitration award. However, as the
 
Circuit Court did not enter findings of fact or conclusions of
 
law concerning whether Low's allegedly perjured testimony had a
 
material effect on a dispositive issue in the arbitration, we are
 
unable to determine on appeal whether Minichino satisfied this
 
requirement for vacatur or, alternatively, whether the Circuit
 
Court properly denied Minichino's motion to vacate.
 
C. Minichino's Public Policy Argument
 Minichino also contends that the Circuit Court erred in
 
failing to vacate the arbitration award under the "public policy"
 doctrine. She asserts that the award violates a dominant public
 
policy against perjury and fraud on the court. We disagree.
 
Hawai'i courts have adopted a narrow ground for setting 
aside arbitration awards that violate public policy. 
Inlandboatmen's Union of the Pacific v. Sause Bros., Inc., 77 
Hawai'i 187, 193-94, 881 P.2d 1255, 1261-62 (App. 1994). This 
limited exception to deferential review is rooted in courts' common law duty to refrain from enforcing illegal contracts. Id. 
at 194, 881 P.2d at 1262. As a result, it is generally invoked 
10/
 In addition, it appears that the arbitrator's award of damages is
grounded in Low's "timely steps" to mitigate his damages upon discovery that
Minichino could not obtain financing.
 
18
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
only when there is an "'explicit conflict' between the
 
arbitration award and the statute." Id. at 196, 881 P.2d at 1264
 
(quoting United Paperworkers Int'l Union v. Misco, Inc., 484 U.S.
 29, 43 (1987)).
 
To vacate an arbitration award on this ground, the
 
movant must establish that: "(1) the award would violate some
 
explicit public policy that is well defined and dominant, and
 
that is ascertained by reference to the laws and legal precedents
 
and not from general considerations of supposed public interests,
 
and (2) the violation of the public policy is clearly shown." 
Id. at 193-94, 881 P.2d at 1261-62 (citation, internal quotation
 
marks, brackets, and ellipses omitted; punctuation altered). In
 
addition, the movant must establish that the policy "specifically
 
militates against the relief ordered by the arbitrator." Stead
 
Motors of Walnut Creek v. Auto. Machinists Lodge No. 1173, Int'l
 Assoc. of Machinists, 886 F.2d 1200, 1212-13 (9th Cir. 1989).
 
Here, Minichino has failed to allege or establish that
 
the award itself -- i.e., awarding damages in favor of Low -­
violates any public policy. She has alleged that the
 
arbitrator's findings and conclusions were tainted by Low's
 
perjury. The statutory grounds embodied in HRS § 658A-23(a)
 
provide sufficient recourse to vacate awards for fraud, including
 
perjury. The public policy exception is inapplicable in this
 
case.
 
V. CONCLUSION
 
For these reasons, we vacate the Circuit Court's
 
December 26, 2007 Judgment and remand this case for an
 
evidentiary hearing and for entry of findings of fact and
 
conclusions of law.
