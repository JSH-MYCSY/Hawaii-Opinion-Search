STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
MICHAEL CHANG, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE CIRCUIT CIRCUIT
(CR. NO. 07-1-1190)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Michael Chang (Chang) appeals from
the Amended Judgment of Conviction and Sentence filed on
January 31, 2008 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
(circuit court).1
On November 8, 2007, a jury convicted Chang of Count I,
Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the Second Degree, in violation of
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 712-1242(1)(b)(i) (Supp. 2006);
Counts II, III, and IV, Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the Third
Degree, in violation of HRS § 712-1243 (Supp. 2008); Count V,
Unlawful Use of Drug Paraphernalia, in violation of HRS § 329-
43.5(a) (1993); Count VI, Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the
Fourth Degree, in violation of HRS § 712-1246.5 (1993); and
Count VII, Driving Without a License, in violation of HRS § 286-
102 (Supp. 2004).  The circuit court sentenced Chang to ten years
of imprisonment on Count I; five years of imprisonment for each
of Counts II, III, IV, and V; and one year of imprisonment for
each of Counts VI and VII.  The circuit court further sentenced
Chang, as a repeat offender, to a mandatory minimum term of
imprisonment of three years and four months on Count I and a
mandatory minimum term imprisonment of one year and eight months
on each of Counts II, III, and IV.  The circuit court orderedNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2that Count I was to run consecutively to Count II and Counts III
through VII were to run concurrently with each other and with
Counts I and II.
On appeal, Chang contended (1) the circuit court erred
by not dismissing the charges pursuant to Rule 48 of the Hawai# i
Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) and (2) the imposition of
consecutive terms requires a jury finding under State v.
Maugaotega, 115 Hawai #i 432, 168 P.3d 562 (2007), and Cunningham
v. California, 549 U.S. 270, 127 S. Ct. 856 (2007).
On June 25, 2009, this court, by Summary Disposition
Order (SDO), affirmed the Amended Judgment of Conviction and
Sentence.  On September 23, 2009, Chang filed an Application for
Writ of Certiorari, which the Hawai #i Supreme Court accepted on
November 2, 2009.  
In its November 2, 2009 Summary Disposition Order, the
supreme court vacated this court's SDO and Judgment on Appeal,
remanded the case to this court with instructions to remand to
the circuit court for entry of appropriate findings of fact and
conclusions of law and a written order disposing of Chang's HRPP
Rule 48 motion, and order the parties to submit additional briefs
on the findings of fact and conclusions of law.
The circuit court having issued findings of fact and
conclusions of law; the parties having submitted additional
briefs pursuant to the November 2, 2009 supreme court Summary
Disposition Order; and this court having carefully considered the
record and the briefs submitted by the parties and having given
due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised
by the parties, we resolve Chang's point of error as follows:
(1)On May 14, 2007, Chang's counsel orally requested
that the charges against Chang be dismissed.  In the written
order prepared by Chang's counsel, it states that Chang moved the
circuit court to dismiss the charges.  Dismissal of charges with
or without prejudice is at the discretion of the circuit court. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
3State v. Jackson, 81 Hawai #i 39, 54-55, 912 P.2d 71, 86-87
(1996). 
Contrary to Chang's claim, HRPP Rule 48(b)(2) applies. 
The circuit court dismissed without prejudice the charges against
Chang upon his motion.  The State re-filed the same charges
against Chang on June 27, 2007.  Chang's trial commenced on
October 31, 2007.  Six months had not elapsed between the re-
filing of the charges and Chang's trial.  Therefore, the circuit
court did not err by denying Chang's oral motion to dismiss
pursuant to HRPP Rule 48. 
(2)  Chang's claim that his consecutive sentences
without a jury finding of fact violated Maugaotega and Cunningham
is without merit.  The Hawai# i Supreme Court has held that the
imposition of consecutive sentences does not require a jury to
make findings of fact.  State v. Kahapea, 111 Hawai #i 267, 279-
80, 141 P.3d 440, 452-53 (2006).
Therefore, 
The Amended Judgment of Conviction and Sentence filed
on January 31, 2008 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is
affirmed.

BENCH MEMORANDUM
Defendant-Appellant Michael Chang (Chang) appeals from
the Amended Judgment of Conviction and Sentence filed on
January 31, 2008 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
(circuit court).   RA at 1572
On November 8, 2007, a jury convicted Chang of Count I,
Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the Second Degree, in violation of
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 712-1242(1)(b)(i) (Supp. 2006);
Counts II, III, and IV, Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the Third
Degree, in violation of HRS § 712-1243 (Supp. 2008); Count V,
Unlawful Use of Drug Paraphernalia, in violation of HRS § 329-
43.5(a) (1993); Count VI, Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the
Fourth Degree, in violation of HRS § 712-1246.5 (1993); and
Count VII, Driving Without a License, in violation of HRS § 286-
102 (Supp. 2004).  RA at 157   The circuit court sentenced Chang
to ten years of imprisonment on Count I; five years of
imprisonment for each of Counts II, III, IV, and V; and one year
of imprisonment for each of Counts VI and VII.  Id.  The circuit
court further sentenced Chang to a mandatory minimum term of
imprisonment of three years and four months as a repeat offender
on Count I and a mandatory minimum term imprisonment of one yearNOT F OR P UBLICATIO N IN WEST'S H AWAI #I REP ORTS  AND PACIF IC REP ORTER
5and eight months on each of Counts II, III, and IV.  Id.  The
circuit court ordered that Count I was to run consecutively to
Count II and Counts III through VII were to run concurrently with
each other and with Counts I and II.  Id. 
On appeal, Chang contends (1) the circuit court erred
by not dismissing the charges pursuant to Rule 48 of the Hawai #i
Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) OB at 9-11  and (2) imposition of
consecutive terms requires a jury finding under State v.
Maugaotega, 115 Hawai #i 432, 168 P.3d 562 (2007), and Cunningham
v. California, 549 U.S. 270, 127 S. Ct. 856 (2007). OB at 11-13
I.  BACKGROUND
On June 20, 2005, Chang was arrested on suspicion of
committing Counts I through VII.  RA Cr. No. 05-1-1303 (RA 1303)
at 6-17  On June 27, 2005, Chang was charged by complaint in Cr.
No. 05-1-1303 with committing Counts I through VII.  RA 1303 at
1-3  
On May 14, 2007, the circuit court held a hearing on
the State's Motion to Continue Trial.  TR 5/14/07 at 2   The State
represented that a police officer was unavailable for trial, the
officer would testify about the chain of custody of evidence, and
the officer was an essential witness for trial because Chang
would not stipulate to chain of custody.  Id. at 2-3   Chang's
defense counsel objected and stated "we move to dismiss with
prejudice and would object to any other disposition other than
trial beginning now or dismissal with prejudice.  We would objectNOT F OR P UBLICATIO N IN WEST'S H AWAI #I REP ORTS  AND PACIF IC REP ORTER
6to a dismissal without prejudice."  Id. at 4   The circuit court
denied the State's Motion to Continue Trial and dismissed the
charges against Change without prejudice.  Id. at 4   On May 29,
2007, the circuit court entered the Order Dismissing Complaint
Without Prejudice (Order), dismissing without prejudice all the
charges against Chang.  RA 1303 at Doc. 29   The Order was
prepared by Chang's counsel and stated:  "Defendant, Michael
Chang, through his attorney, Joseph R. Mottl, moved the Court to
dismiss the Complaint with prejudice on grounds that the State of
Hawaii was not ready to begin trial on the morning of scheduled
jury selection."  RA 1303 at Doc. 29   Chang did not appeal the
dismissal without prejudice of the charges against him.
On June 27, 2007, Chang was indicted in Cr. No. 07-1-
1190 for the same seven counts.  RA at 1-3   On October 30, 2007,
Chang filed a Memorandum in Support of Oral Motion to Dismiss
Indictment for Violation of Rule 48, HRPP.  RA at 54-63  Chang
asserted that on October 23, 2007 he had orally moved to dismiss
the charges on grounds that 292 days had expired from the date of
his arrest.  RA 07 at 55   
Immediately prior to the start of trial on October 31,
2007, Chang orally renewed his motion to dismiss the charges
pursuant to HRPP Rule 48.  TR 10/31/07 at 3   Chang claimed that
the time period since Chang's arrest to present constituted over
180 days and therefore the charges should be dismissed.  Id. at
4-5  The State argued that HRPP Rule 48(b)(2) applied and thatNOT F OR P UBLICATIO N IN WEST'S H AWAI #I REP ORTS  AND PACIF IC REP ORTER
7since the indictment had been filed on June 27, 2007, six months
had not elapsed.  Id. at 5-6  The State denied that it had made a
previous motion to dismiss the charges in Cr No. 05-1-1303, it
asserted that Chang had made the motion to dismiss the charges,
and the State had only objected to dismissal with prejudice if
the circuit court was inclined to dismiss the charges.  Id. at 6 
The circuit court orally denied Chang's motion to dismiss the
charges and stated:  "The court agrees with the State for the
reasons set forth."  Id.
A jury convicted Chang as charged and the circuit court
sentenced Chang as stated above.  Chang timely filed this appeal.
II.  STANDARD OF REVIEW  
HRPP Rule 48
We review a trial court's denial of a Hawai #i Rules of
Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 48 motion to dismiss under both the
"clearly erroneous" and "right/wrong" tests:
A trial court's findings of fact (FOFs) in deciding an
HRPP 48(b) motion to dismiss are subject to the clearly
erroneous standard of review.  An FOF is clearly erroneous
when, despite evidence to support the finding, the appellate
court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a
mistake has been committed.  However, whether those facts
fall within HRPP 48(b)'s exclusionary provisions is a
question of law, the determination of which is freely
reviewable pursuant to the "right/wrong" test.  
State v. Samonte, 83 Hawai #i 507, 514, 928 P.2d 1, 8 (1996)
(quoting State v. Hutch, 75 Haw. 307, 328-29, 861 P.2d 11, 22
(1993)).
Sentencing
[A] sentencing judge generally has broad discretion in
imposing a sentence.  The applicable standard of review forNOT F OR P UBLICATIO N IN WEST'S H AWAI #I REP ORTS  AND PACIF IC REP ORTER
8sentencing or resentencing matters is whether the court
committed plain and manifest abuse of discretion in its
decision.
Factors which indicate a plain and manifest abuse of
discretion are arbitrary or capricious action by the
judge and a rigid refusal to consider the defendant's
contentions.  And, generally, to constitute an abuse
it must appear that the court clearly exceeded the
bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles of
law or practice to the substantial detriment of a
party litigant.

(2000)[.]
State v. Kahapea, 111 Hawai #i 267, 278, 141 P.3d 440, 451 (2006)
(citations and brackets omitted).
III.  DISCUSSION
A.The Circuit Court Did Not Err By Denying Chang's Motion To
Dismiss Pursuant To HRPP Rule 48
Chang claims the circuit court erred by denying his
Motion to Dismiss pursuant to HRPP Rule 48.  Chang claims the
charges were dismissed at the request of the State, therefore
HRPP Rule 48(b)(2) does not apply.  Contrary to Chang's claim,
the State did not request that the charges be dismissed, rather
Chang requested that the charges be dismissed.  Therefore, HRPP
Rule 48(b)(2) does apply. 
HRPP Rule 48 states in part:
Rule 48. DISMISSAL.
(a) By prosecutor. The prosecutor may by leave of
court file a dismissal of a charge and the
prosecution shall thereupon terminate. Such a
dismissal may not be filed during the trial without
the
consent of the defendant.
(b) By court. Except in the case of traffic offenses
that are not punishable by imprisonment, the court
shall, on motion of the defendant, dismiss the charge,
with or without prejudice in its discretion, if trial
is not commenced within 6 months:NOT F OR P UBLICATIO N IN WEST'S H AWAI #I REP ORTS  AND PACIF IC REP ORTER
9(1) from the date of arrest if bail is set or
from the filing of the charge, whichever is
sooner, on any offense based on the same conduct
or arising from the same criminal episode for
which the arrest or charge was made; or
(2) from the date of re-arrest or re-filing of
the charge, in cases where an initial charge was
dismissed upon motion of the defendant; or (3)
from the date of mistrial, order granting a new
trial or remand, in cases where such events
require a new trial.
Clauses (b)(1) and (b)(2) shall not be applicable to
any offense for which the arrest was made or the
charge was filed prior to the effective date of the
rule.
On May 14, 2007, Chang's defense counsel orally
requested that the charges be dismissed.  [TR 5/14/07 at 3-4]   In
the written order prepared by Chang's defense counsel, it states
that Chang moved the court to dismiss the charges.  [RA 05 at
document 29]  Dismissal of the charges with or without prejudice
is at the discretion of the circuit court.  State v. Jackson, 81
Hawai#i 39, 54-55, 912 P.2d 71, 86-87 (1996).  It is not
significant that Chang only requested that the charges be
dismissed with prejudice and the circuit court dismissed the
charges without prejudice.  If Chang disputed the dismissal of
the charges without prejudice instead of with prejudice, he
should have appealed the circuit court's May 29, 2007 order in
Cr. No. 05-1-1303 because it was a final appealable order.  Chang
did not do so.  Therefore, Chang may not argue in this appeal
that charges should have been previously dismissed with prejudice
and that he did not request dismissal of the charges.  
Contrary to Chang's claim, HRPP Rule 48(b)(2) applies. 
The circuit court previously dismissed the charges against ChangNOT F OR P UBLICATIO N IN WEST'S H AWAI #I REP ORTS  AND PACIF IC REP ORTER
10without prejudice upon his motion.  Charges against Chang were
re-filed on June 27, 2007.  Chang's trial commenced on October
31, 2007. [TR 10/31/07 generally]   Six months had not elapsed
between the re-filing of the charges and Chang's trial. 
Therefore, the circuit court did not err by denying Chang's
Motion to Dismiss pursuant to HRPP Rule 48.  
B.Consecutive Sentencing Claim
In his Opening Brief, Chang claimed that his
consecutive sentences violated Maugaotega, supra, and Cunningham,
supra.  In his Reply Brief, Chang conceded that his argument
concerning his consecutive sentencing claim was rendered null in
part.  However, in his Reply Brief, Chang asserted a new ground
for challenging his mandatory minimum sentences because they
appear to run consecutively. [RB at 4]   Chang belatedly claims
that his mandatory minimum sentences may not be imposed
consecutively, citing State v. Cornelio, 84 Hawai #i 476, 935 P.2d
1021 (1997) in support of his argument.  Chang argues that the
Amended Judgment "can be clearly interpreted as issuing
consecutive mandatory minimum terms in Counts 1 and 2." [RB at 4]
The Amended Judgment states:
Mandatory minimum terms as a repeat offender:
Three (3) years and four (4) months in Count 1;
One (1) year and eight (8) months each count in Counts
2, 3, and 4 
Incarceration:
Ten (10) years in Count 1; Five (5) years each count
in Counts 2, 3, & 4; Five (5) years in Count 5, One
(1) year each count in Counts 6 and 7, with Counts 1
and 2 to run consecutively to one another and with
remaining counts running concurrently w/one another
and with Counts 1 and 3;NOT F OR P UBLICATIO N IN WEST'S H AWAI #I REP ORTS  AND PACIF IC REP ORTER
11This sentence shall run consecutively to any other
term that the defendant is currently serving; Credit
given for time already served; Mittimus to issue
immediately.
[RA 07 at 157]
We agree that consecutive mandatory minimum sentences
may not be imposed in connection with the same multi-count
indictment.  See Cornelio, 84 Hawai #i at 480, 935 P.2d at 1025. 
However, a plain reading of Amended Judgment does not require
imposition of consecutive mandatory minimums sentences for the
multi-count indictment for which Chang was convicted.  Even if
the language of the Amended Judgment is ambiguous, Chang cannot
prove that consecutive mandatory minimum sentences have actually
been imposed and that his sentence is illegal.  Chang also raised
this issue in his Reply Brief.  Thus, the State was not afforded
an opportunity to state whether the Amended Judgment imposed a
consecutive mandatory minimum sentence.  Therefore, Chang's point
of error is dismissed without prejudice to raising the issue in
petition pursuant to HRPP Rule 40.  
IV.  CONCLUSION
The Amended Judgment of Conviction and Sentence filed
on January 31, 2008 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is
affirmed.
