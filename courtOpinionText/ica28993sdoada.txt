NO. 28993
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
EARNEST LUTHER ROBERTS, also known as "er695,"
Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 07-1-1245)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Earnest Luther Roberts, also known
 
as "er695," (Roberts) appeals from the Judgment of Conviction and
 
Sentence filed on January 18, 2008 in the Circuit Court of the
 First Circuit (circuit court).
1 A jury found Roberts guilty of
 
Electronic Enticement of a Child in the First Degree (electronic
 enticement), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707­756 (Supp. 2007). The circuit court sentenced Roberts to ten
 years of incarceration, with credit for time served.
 
On appeal, Roberts contends the circuit court
 (1) erred in denying his second oral motion for 
judgment of acquittal (JA Motion) because the State of Hawai
'i 
(State) failed to adduce sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction; 
(2) plainly erred by trying this case because the
 
court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the indictment
 since he did not use a computer or any other electronic device in
 the City and County of Honolulu (Honolulu), within the meaning of
 HRS § 707-756; and
 
(3) abused its discretion in sentencing him to an open 
ten-year term of imprisonment, which was "10 times harsher" than the defendants in two of three similar Hawai
'i cases.

Roberts requests that we vacate and remand this case
 
for entry of judgment of acquittal. Alternatively, he asks that
 
we remand the case for re-sentencing consistent with HRS § 706­606(4) (Supp. 2008).
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Roberts's
 points of error as follows:
 
(1) The circuit court did not err in denying Roberts's
 
JA Motion because the State adduced sufficient evidence to
 sustain the conviction. The record on appeal provides
 substantial evidence that Roberts intended to meet with the
 "minor" at the agreed upon location. He discussed meeting with
 the "minor" numerous times via the computer chat room and
 telephone conversations. A majority of the time, he clearly
 intended and looked forward to meeting with the "minor." His
 actions of parking kitty-corner to the Humane Society and,
 according to Agent Kim's testimony, focusing his attention on the
 Humane Society for forty-six minutes straight, strongly suggest
 he had intended to or knew he had traveled to the agreed upon
 meeting place. That he did not go to the benches fronting the
 Humane Society building is of little consequence; the record
 clearly shows that he had agreed to meet the "minor" at the
 Humane Society in general. See HRS § 707-756 (Supp. 2007); State
 
v. Nicholson, 120 Hawai
'i 480, 482 & 484-85, 210 P.3d 3, 5 & 7-8 
(2009). 
The State did not entrap Roberts. Roberts consistently
 
introduced the topic of engaging in sexual activity in his
 conversations with the "minor"; broached the prospect of meeting
 the "minor" in person; and asked the "minor" to engage in oral
 sex and sexual intercourse with him on numerous occasions, after
 the "minor" explicitly informed him that "she" was thirteen years
 old and repeatedly invoked "her" age by reference to "her"
 anatomy, school, and parents and grandparents. The "minor"
 expressed hesitation about meeting with Roberts and gave him many
 opportunities to back out of their plan. See HRS § 702-237

(1993); Nicholson, 120 Hawai 'i at 482-83 & 486, 210 P.3d at 5-6 & 
9; United States v. Myers, 575 F.3d 801, 805 (8th Cir. 2009); 
United States v. Chaudhry, 321 Fed. Appx. 119, 121-22, (3d Cir. 2009). 
(2) The circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction 
over the indictment. See HRS § 708-895 (Supp. 2008); State v. 
Stan's Contracting, Inc., 111 Hawai
'i 17, 32, 137 P.3d 331, 346 
(2006); Hawai 'i Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 18. 
(3) The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in
 
sentencing Roberts to an open ten-year term of imprisonment. See
 
HRS § 707-756(2) (Supp. 2007). 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment of Conviction
 
and Sentence filed on January 18, 2008 in the Circuit Court of
 the First Circuit is affirmed.
