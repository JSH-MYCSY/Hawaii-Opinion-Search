IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
DARREL LLOYD JARMUSCH, Defendant-Appellant.
(CR NOS. 07-1-0001 and 01-1-0034) 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Darrel Lloyd Jarmusch (Jarmusch)

 
appeals from the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence in Criminal
 
No. 07-1-0001 entered by the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit
 
(Circuit Court) on February 15, 2008.1 Following a jury trial,
 
Jarmusch was convicted of Obstructing Government Operations in
 violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 710-1010[1](a)
 
(Supp. 2010) and Harassment in violation of HRS § 711-1106(1)(b)
 
(1993). Jarmusch also appeals the Circuit Court’s February 25,
 
2008 order granting the State’s Motion for Revocation of
 
Jarmusch’s Deferred Acceptance of No Contest (DANC) plea in
 
Criminal No. 01-1-0034. Both appeals were consolidated by this
 
court.

 The Honorable Kathleen N. A. Watanabe presided in Criminal No. 07-1­
0001 and in regards to the revocation of the DANC in Criminal No. 01-1-0034.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal, Jarmusch alleges the following points of 
error: (1) the Circuit Court erred by denying Jarmusch the right 
to counsel and ordering him to proceed to trial pro se; (2) the 
Circuit Court erred in adopting, without review, the Public 
Defender’s erroneous determination that Jarmusch did not qualify 
for the services of appointed counsel because Jarmusch owned his 
residence, even after learning that Jarmusch lost his job before 
trial; (3) the Circuit Court erred by concluding that excluded 
time periods set forth in Rule 48(c) of the Hawai 'i Rules of 
Penal Procedure (HRPP) (2000) had been established without first making appropriate findings of fact; and (4) the Circuit Court 
committed plain error when it set aside the DANC plea in Criminal 
No. 01-1-0034 based on the allegedly improper convictions in 
Criminal No. 07-1-0001. 
Based upon our careful review of the record, the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
vacate the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence in Criminal No.
 
07-1-0001, the order denying Jarmusch's HRPP 48 motion in
 
Criminal No. 07-1-0001, and the order granting the State’s Motion
 
for Revocation of Jarmusch’s DANC plea in Criminal No. 01-1-0034. 
We remand for further proceedings.
 
I. Right to Counsel Issues
 
A. Waiver of Counsel
 
Jarmusch asserts on appeal that he was required to 
proceed pro se even though he consistently asserted his right to 
counsel and he never asserted a right to proceed pro se. As more 
accurately reflected in the record, throughout the proceedings 
below, Jarmusch insisted that he wanted to represent himself with 
the "assistance" of counsel. In short, Jarmusch was insisting on 
standby or hybrid counsel. See State v. Mundon, 121 Hawai
'i 339, 
219 P.3d 1126 (2009); State v. Hirano, 8 Haw. App. 330, 802 P.2d 
2
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
482 (1990). With regard to Jarmusch's assertion on appeal that
 
he had the right to such counsel, we disagree.
 
"Both federal and state courts have uniformly held that
 
there is no sixth amendment right to hybrid representation, but
 
the matter is within the discretion of the court." Hirano, 8
 
Haw. App. at 334, 802 P.2d at 484. This court therefore held in
 Hirano that "in concert with the weight of authority" any right
 
to appear pro se "does not include the right to hybrid
 
representation." Id. at 336, 802 P.2d at 485. Instead, "[s]uch
 
representation is in the discretion of the trial court." Id.
 
Although the Circuit Court was not obligated to allow 
Jarmusch to have hybrid counsel, and Jarmusch continually 
asserted he did not want to be "represented" by counsel, the 
court was obligated to ensure a proper waiver of counsel before 
Jarmusch proceeded pro se.
2 "The right to counsel is waivable 
when it is voluntarily and intelligently undertaken." State v. 
Merino, 81 Hawai 'i 198, 219, 915 P.2d 672, 693 (1996) (internal 
quotation marks and citation omitted). 
[W]aiver is a question that requires application of
constitutional principles to the facts as found.
Accomplishment of this task requires us to examine the
entire record and make an independent determination of the
ultimate issue based upon that review and the totality of
the circumstances. Thus, we apply a de novo standard of
 appellate review to the ultimate issue of the voluntariness,
knowledge, and intelligence of a waiver.
 
Id. at 220, 915 P.2d at 694 (brackets and ellipses omitted)
 
(quoting State v. Hoey, 77 Hawaii 17, 32, 881 P.2d 504, 519
 
(1994)).
 
2
 In this case, the Circuit Court on several occasions encouraged and
allowed time for Jarmusch to apply for services with the Office of the Public
Defender or to retain counsel, but Jarmusch did not secure counsel throughout
the pretrial and trial proceedings. Instead, he did ultimately represent
himself before the Circuit Court.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In State v. Dickson, 4 Haw. App. 614, 673 P.2d 1036,
 
(1983), this court set out the following framework:
 
The trial court is initially charged with the function
of assuring that the defendant's waiver of counsel is made
knowingly and intelligently and that the record is complete
so as to reflect that waiver.
 
The trial court should first examine the particular
facts and circumstances relating to the defendant, such as
the defendant's age, education, mental capacity, background
and experience, and his conduct at the time of the alleged
waiver. This is necessary to allow the trial court to
determine the level and depth to which its explanation and inquiry must extend.

 
Secondly, in order to fully assure that the
defendant is informed of the risks of
 self-representation, the trial court should make him
aware of the nature of the charge, the elements of the
offense, the pleas and defenses available, the
punishments which may be imposed, and all other facts
essential to a broad understanding of the whole
matter.
 
Finally, the trial court should inform the defendant:
of his right to counsel, whether private or appointed; that
self-representation is detrimental to himself; that he will
be required to follow all technical rules and substantive,
procedural, and evidentiary law; that the prosecution will
be represented by able counsel; that a disruption of the
trial could lead to vacation of the right to
self-representation; and that if voluntary
self-representation occurs, the defendant may not afterward
claim that he had inadequate representation.
 
The trial judge is not required to give the
defendant a short course in criminal law and
 procedure, since a defendant's technical legal
knowledge is not relevant to an assessment of his
knowing exercise of the right to defend himself.
However, the record should reflect some interchange on
the above matters such as will indicate to a reviewing
court that the defendant knew and understood the
 dangers and disadvantages of self-representation.
 
Those matters, which we shall call here
"specific waiver inquiry" factors, provide a guideline
for the trial court in dealing with a demand for
waiver of counsel. The record need not reflect a
 discussion between the court and a defendant
 illuminating every such factor. However, where the
record fails to reflect that the trial court has
 sufficiently examined the defendant so as to establish
that he is aware of the dangers and disadvantages of
self-representation, or that the defendant has made a
knowing and intelligent waiver, an appellate court
will be hard-pressed to find that a defendant has
effectively waived counsel. In such situations, the
conviction of a pro se criminal defendant is
 vulnerable to reversal unless the record also contains
 overwhelming circumstantial evidence indicating that
 
4
          
         
        NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
the requirements for a knowing and intelligent waiver
have otherwise been met.
 
Id. at 619-621, 673 P.2d at 1041-1042 (citations and footnote
 
omitted).
 
Here, based on our review of the record, in the later
 
stages of the proceedings, the Circuit Court did address some of
 
the Dickson waiver inquiry factors with Jarmusch.3 However, even
 
then the Circuit Court did not make any inquiry as to Jarmusch's
 age, education, mental capacity, background or experience with
 
the judicial system; and the Circuit Court did not advise
 
Jarmusch of the elements of the charges, the pleas and defenses
 
available, that a disruption of the trial could lead to vacation
 
of the right to self-representation, and that if he proceeded pro
 
se he may not afterward claim that he had inadequate
 
representation.
 
Although not every Dickson factor need be discussed
 
between the court and a defendant, we conclude there was not
 
sufficient examination of Jarmusch to establish he was aware of
 
"the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, or that
 [he] has made a knowing and intelligent waiver." 4 Haw. App. at
 
621, 673 P.2d at 1042 (citations omitted). Further, although at
 
times Jarmusch appeared somewhat sophisticated in the legal
 process, he also appeared legitimately confused in other
 
instances. Thus, like in Dickson, we hold "there is insufficient
 
circumstantial evidence in the record to convince this court that
 [Jarmusch] actually knew what he was doing." Id. at 622, 673
 
P.2d at 1043.
 
We therefore conclude that Jarmusch did not knowingly
 
and intelligently waive his right to counsel, and we vacate his
 convictions in Criminal No. 07-1-0001. 
3
 The Circuit Court discussed with Jarmusch the charges against him,
the penalties for the charges, the Circuit Court's procedural rules, trial
procedure, and that the deputy prosecutor had the benefit of legal training.

         NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
B. Qualification for Services From the Public Defender
 
Jarmusch also contends the Circuit Court erred in not
 
reviewing the Office of the Public Defender's determination that
 
he did not qualify for appointed counsel because he owned his
 
residence. We need not reach this question. Throughout the
 
proceedings below, Jarmusch expressed that he wanted hybrid
 
counsel and that he did not want to be "represented" by an
 
attorney. The Office of the Public Defender stated on the record
 
that the office does not provide hybrid or standby counsel, and
 
as noted above, such counsel is not constitutionally required. 
Hirano, 8 Haw. App. at 334, 802 P.2d at 484.  Therefore, for this
 
reason alone, the Circuit Court was not required to consider
 
whether Jarmusch qualified from a financial perspective for
 
appointed counsel.
II. Speedy Trial Motion
 
Jarmusch filed a motion pursuant to HRPP 48 asserting
 
that his rights to a speedy trial had been violated and that the
 
charges against him should be dismissed. At the time Jarmusch
 
filed his motion on November 27, 2007, it had been more than six
 
months since his arrest on November 28, 2006.4 In State v.
 
Hutch, 75 Haw. 307, 861 P.2d 11 (1993), the Hawai 'i Supreme Court 
explained that:
 
An HRPP 48(b) motion to dismiss, by its very nature,
involves factual issues. Pursuant to the rule, a defendant
may move to dismiss the charges against him or her if trial
is not commenced within six months (construed as one hundred
eighty days) from the events enumerated within its
provisions. HRPP 48(c) mandates that the court exclude
certain time periods from its computation in determining
whether the one hundred eighty days have run. Before the
 court may conclude as a matter of law that any of the
excluded time periods set forth in HRPP 48(c) have been
established, it must first make the appropriate FOF.
 
4
 The date of arrest is the triggering date for this case, where bail
was set. See HRPP 48(b)(1).
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
75 Haw. at 330-31, 861 P.2d at 23. Because in Hutch the trial 
courts had denied the defendant's motions to dismiss under HRPP 
Rule 48 without stating their "essential findings on the record," 
the Hawai 'i Supreme Court vacated the orders denying the motions 
and remanded for entry of appropriate findings of fact. Id. at 
331, 861 P.2d at 23. 
In this case, as pointed out by Jarmusch, the Circuit
 
Court did not make findings of fact on the record in denying his 
HRPP Rule 48 motion to dismiss, which was heard on the same day
 
it was filed. Likewise, the Circuit Court's December 5, 2007
 
"Order Denying Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Charges With
 
Prejudice for State's Violation of Defendant's Right to Speedy
 
Trial (Rule 48) filed on November 27, 2007" (Order Denying HRPP
 
48 Motion To Dismiss) did not contain any findings of fact. 
Therefore, there are no findings of fact to support the Circuit
 
Court's necessary conclusion that there are excluded time periods
 
under HRPP 48(c).
 
Pursuant to Hutch, the Circuit Court erred in not
 
making appropriate findings of fact as to excluded time periods
 
to support its denial of Jarmusch's HRPP 48 motion to dismiss. 
We therefore vacate the Circuit Court's Order Denying HRPP 48
 
Motion To Dismiss, filed on December 5, 2007, and remand for
 
further proceedings on this motion.
 
On remand, because Jarmusch initially filed the HRPP 48
 
motion when he was acting pro se, the Circuit Court shall allow
 
Jarmusch to re-file or supplement his HRPP 48 motion to dismiss
 
after appropriate steps are taken regarding his right to counsel
 
or there is a knowing and intelligent waiver of counsel. 
Thereafter, the Circuit Court shall enter appropriate findings of
 
fact and a further order on the HRPP 48 motion.
 
III. Revocation of DANC Plea in Criminal No. 01-1-0034
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Following Jarmusch's conviction in Criminal No. 07-1­
0001, the Circuit Court granted the State's motion for revocation
 
of a DANC plea previously granted to Jarmusch in Criminal No. 01­
1-0034. Although the State's motion for revocation of the DANC
 
plea was initially filed based on Jarmusch's arrest in Criminal
 
No. 07-1-0001, the Circuit Court made clear that its order
 
revoking the DANC plea was based on the convictions in Criminal
 
No. 07-1-0001. Because we vacate the convictions in Criminal No.
 
07-1-0001, we also vacate the Circuit Court's order granting
 
revocation of the DANC plea in Criminal No. 01-1-0034.
 
IV. Conclusion
 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate: (a) the Judgment
 
of Conviction and Sentence filed February 15, 2008 in Criminal
 
No. 07-1-0001; (b) the Order Denying HRPP 48 Motion to Dismiss
 
filed on December 5, 2007 in Criminal No. 07-1-0001; and (c) the
 
"Order Granting Motion For Revocation of Deferred Acceptance of
 
No Contest Plea Filed on June 22, 2007" in Criminal No. 01-1­
0034, entered on February 25, 2008. We remand for further
 
proceedings in both Criminal No. 07-1-0001 and Criminal No. 01-1­
0034 consistent with this Summary Disposition Order.
