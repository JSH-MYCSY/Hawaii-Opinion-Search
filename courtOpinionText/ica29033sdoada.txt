APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT

 
(CIVIL NO. 06-1-0449(3))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER

 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
 
This appeal arises from a decision of the Condominium
 
Dispute Resolution Program of the Department of Commerce and
 
Consumer Affairs ("DCCA"). Appellant/Respondent-Appellee Palms
 
at Wailea, #3603, L.L.P. ("Partnership") appeals from the Circuit
 Court of the Second Circuit's (Circuit Court) December 14, 2007
 
Judgment on Appeal reversing the DCCA's October 25, 2006 "Order
 
Granting in Part and Denying in Part Respondent The Palms at
 
Wailea, #3603's Motion for Summary Judgment" and remanding the
 
case for further proceedings.
1/ The DCCA's order arose from a
 
Request for Hearing, submitted by Appellee/Petitioner-Appellant
 Association of Apartment Owners of the Palms at Wailea
 
1/
 The Honorable Joseph E. Cardoza presided.
  
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
("Association"), seeking an injunction of the Partnership's
 
alleged timesharing and short-term rental activities. 
This appeal arises from the Partnership's alleged
 
timeshare and short-term rental arrangement at unit 3603 of The
 
Palms at Wailea in contravention of a restrictive covenant
 
prohibiting such arrangements. The Association operates The
 
Palms at Wailea, a condominium project located in Wailea, Maui. 
The Palms, including unit 3603, are subject to the Declaration of
 
Condominium Property Regime ("Covenant") restricting their use to
 
permanent or temporary residential purposes and prohibiting
 
timeshare arrangements and short-term rentals. The Covenant
 
originally defined timeshare arrangements in accordance with
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 514E (2001). As discussed below,
 
the Association later broadened that definition. The
 
Association's bylaws also require that the apartments "shall be
 
used only for their respective purposes as set forth in the
 
Declaration and for no other purpose." 
In 1997, the Association contacted the owners of unit
 
3603 and requested that they cease operating as a timeshare
 
arrangement in violation of the Covenant. Shortly thereafter,
 
the owners entered into a Limited Liability Partnership Agreement
 
and conveyed unit 3603 to the Partnership by deed dated March 23,
 
1998. The Partnership notified the Association that its use of
 
the apartment would not constitute a timeshare arrangement under
 
HRS § 514E-1, and submitted a notarized declaration to that
 
effect.
 
At the time of the conveyance, the Partnership
 
consisted of sixteen partners. The Partnership Agreement
 
provides that the partners will meet annually to "create a
 
schedule of use [for the apartment] for the next calendar year." 
At the meeting, "[t]he parties shall agree to an agreeable use,
 
and the Secretary/Treasurer shall record the results thereof." 
The Agreement requires that any subsequent changes to the
 
2    
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
schedule must be made at least ten days in advance and submitted
 
to the Secretary/Treasurer.

 
The Covenant was amended in 2005 to clarify and expand
 
the definition of timeshare arrangements. The amendment
 
provides, in pertinent part:
 
8. PURPOSES AND RESTRICTIONS AS TO USE.
 (a) THE RESIDENTIAL APARTMENTS SHALL BE OCCUPIED
 
AND USED ONLY FOR PERMANENT OR TEMPORARY RESIDENTIAL
 
PURPOSES, AND SUCH USE SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE ZONING
ORDINANCES OF THE COUNTY OF MAUI (WHICH AS OF THE DATE
HEREOF REQUIRES "LONG TERM RESIDENTIAL USE" WHICH IS DEFINED
IN SUCH ORDINANCE AS OCCUPANCY BY EITHER THE APARTMENT OWNER
 OR HIS LESSEE FOR A TERM OF SIX (6) MONTHS OR MORE).
DEVELOPER HAS ENTERED INTO A CERTIFICATION OF LONG TERM
 RESIDENTIAL USE WHICH IS BINDING ON ALL APARTMENT OWNERS. A
 COPY OF SUCH CERTIFICATION IS ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT "1"
 HERETO.
 In addition to the foregoing restrictions as to
use, the residential apartments shall not be rented for
transient or hotel purposes, which are defined as (a) rental
for any period less than thirty (30) days, or (b) any rental
in which the occupants of the residential apartment are
provided customary hotel services such as room service for
food and beverage, maid service, laundry and linen or
bellboy service. The residential apartments in the Project
or any interest therein shall not be sold, transferred,
conveyed, leased, occupied, rented or used for or in
connection with any time-sharing purpose or under any time­sharing plan, arrangement or program, including without
limitation any so-called "vacation licence," "travel club or
other membership," or "time-interval ownership" arrangement.
The term "time-sharing" as used herein shall be deemed to
include, but shall not be limited to, any plan, program or
arrangement under which the right to use, occupy, own, lease
or possess an apartment or apartments in the Project rotates
among various persons on a periodically recurring basis
according to a fixed or floating interval or period of time,
whether by way of deed, lease, association or club
membership, license, beneficial interest under a Hawaii Land
Trust, rental or use agreement, co-tenancy agreement,
partnership agreement, or otherwise.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
On July 28, 2006, the Association filed a Request for
 
Hearing with the DCCA, alleging that the Partnership was engaging
 
in timeshare and short-term rental arrangements in violation of
 
the Covenant and bylaws. The Association initially maintained
 
that the prohibited use had been occurring "[s]ince approximately
 
September 1997" and "is continuing to this day." The Association
 
3  
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
later clarified that its claim was based on the use of premises
 
in 2006.
 
The Partnership filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on
 
September 5, 2006, arguing that the Association's claims were
 
time-barred.  It further requested summary judgment, ostensibly
 
on the grounds that the Association failed to state a claim and
 
there was "no triable issue of fact." The DCCA held a hearing on
 

 the motion on September 11, 2006. 
By letter dated September 27, 2006, the DCCA informed
 
the parties of its decision to grant the Partnership's motion. 
It stated, in pertinent part:
 
After reviewing and considering the evidence and arguments
presented, I have decided to grant Respondent's Motion for
Summary Judgment on the basis that Petitioner's claims are
time barred. Petitioner did not demonstrate specific facts
that present a genuine issue worthy of trial and therefore
Respondent is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of
law. The remaining arguments raised in Respondent's Motion
need not be addressed. However, as a matter of
 
jurisdiction, which the Hearings Officer can raise sua
 sponte, HRS § 514B-161 only allows the Hearings Officer to
interpret, apply or enforce "this chapter" which is Chapter
514B. Accordingly, the Hearings Officer does not have
jurisdiction to interpret, apply or enforce HRS Chapter 514E
or the Maui County Ordinances.
 
The DCCA issued its "Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part
 
Respondent the Palms at Wailea, # 3603's Motion for Summary
 
Judgment" on October 25, 2006.  The order stated, in part:
 
IT IS ORDERED that Respondent's Motion for Summary Judgment
be and the same is hereby GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART
as follows:
 
A. Petitioner's claims are barred by the applicable
statute of limitations;
 B. Under HRS Section 514B-161, the Administrative Hearings
Officer only has authority to interpret, enforce and apply
HRS, Chapter 514B. Therefore, the Administrative Hearings
Officer does not have jurisdiction to hear Petitioner's
claims because they require the Administrative Hearings
Officer to interpret, enforce, and apply HRS, Chapter 514E
and Maui County Ordinances.
 
C. As a matter of law, Respondent is entitled to judgment
in its favor and against Petitioner; and,
 
4  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
D. Respondent's request for attorney's fees and costs is
denied.
 
On appeal, the Circuit Court determined that the 
Association's claims were not time-barred by the applicable 
statute of limitations. It further concluded that the DCCA 
failed to apply the appropriate standards for granting summary 
judgment under Hawai 'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 
56(e). In addition, it determined that the Association's claims 
were within the DCCA's jurisdiction.2/ The Circuit Court 
therefore reversed the DCCA's October 25, 2006 order and remanded the case for further proceedings. 
The Partnership filed a timely notice of appeal on
 
February 26, 2008.
 
On appeal, the Partnership raises three points of
 
error: (1) the Circuit Court erred in concluding that the
 
Association's claims were not time-barred pursuant to the statute
 
of limitations, HRS § 657-1(4) (1993); (2) the Circuit Court
 
erred in determining that the DCCA should have applied the
 
requirements of HRCP Rule 56(e); and (3) the Circuit Court erred
 
in ruling that a breach of contract can be continuous and that
 
the case should be remanded to the DCCA for further proceedings.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve the Partnership's points of error as follows:
 
(1) The Partnership contends that the Association's
 
claim for injunctive relief was time-barred by the statute of
 
limitations under HRS § 657-1. The Partnership argues that
 
because the Covenant prohibiting timeshare arrangements was
 
breached in 1997, and its partnership arrangement – alleged by
 
2/
 On appeal, the Partnership does not challenge the portion of the
Circuit Court's order regarding the propriety of the DCCA's jurisdiction.
 
5  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Association to be a timeshare arrangement – has not changed since
 
that time, the statute of limitations began running at that time. 
Where a contract imposes a future duty, the statute of 
limitations does not begin running until the breach actually 
occurs. Au v. Au, 63 Hawai 'i 210, 219, 626 P.2d 173, 180 (1981). 
Similarly, where a covenant imposes an ongoing obligation, a new and separate violation occurs each time the obligor breaches the 
covenant. Thus, the statute of limitations begins running anew 
for each successive breach. See, e.g., Barker v. Jeremiasen, 676 
P.2d 1259, 1261-62 (Colo. App. 1984) (covenant "imposed a continuing obligation upon the defendants" to refrain from 
prohibited uses; court held that the statute of limitations did 
not bar the action because the defendants' continuing operation 
of the farm resulted in "repeated and successive breaches"); 
Fla. Mun. Power Agency v. Fla. Power and Light Co., 81 F. Supp. 
2d 1313, 1321 (M.D. Fla. 1999) (holding that for a long-term 
continuing contract, each successive breach begins the statute of 
limitations anew); Diefenthal v. Longue Vue Mgmt. Corp., 561 
So.2d 44, 48-49, 55 (La. 1990) (continuing covenant prohibiting 
commercial use of property was not time-barred, given continuous 
nature of the covenant violations); Kaliopulus v. Lumm, 141 A. 
440, 445 (Md. 1928). 
Here, the Partnership's alleged use violation cannot
 
simply be considered a single breach from the inception of the
 
Partnership Agreement. The Covenant imposes a continuing
 
obligation on the Partnership to refrain from using its apartment
 
for timeshare purposes or short-term rentals. Each time the
 
Partnership uses the apartment in violation of the Covenant, it
 
commits a new and separate breach. The Association's claim for
 
injunctive relief was based on continuing violations and,
 
therefore, was within the applicable statute of limitations.
 
(2 & 3) The Circuit Court concluded that the DCCA
 
erred in failing to apply the evidentiary requirements of HRCP
 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Rule 56(e) to the Partnership's Motion for Summary Judgment. 
The Partnership contends that HRCP Rule 56(e) is not applicable
 
in administrative proceedings because the administrative rules
 
provide for motions and attendant evidentiary standards. 
Although we agree with the Partnership's assertion that HRCP Rule
 
56 is not binding on the agency, we agree with the Circuit
 
Court's conclusion that the DCCA erred in granting summary
 
judgment in favor of the Partnership.
 
Chapter 16-201 of the Hawai 'i Administrative Rules 
(HAR) governs hearings before the DCCA. HRS § 514A-121.5(g) 
(2007). The Administrative Rules do not specifically provide for 
disposition by summary judgment. They do, however, provide for 
the submission of motions and set forth evidentiary standards. 
HAR §§ 16-201-16, 16-201-21 (1990). A party may move for "any 
relief or order" in writing or at a hearing. HAR § 16-201-16(a). 
"Motions referring to facts not of record shall be supported by 
affidavits." HAR § 16-201-16(b). Admissibility of evidence in 
proceedings before the DCCA is not governed by the rules of 
evidence, and "all relevant oral or documentary evidence shall be 
admitted if it is the sort of evidence on which reasonable 
persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious 
affairs." HAR § 16-201-21. 
Whenever Chapter 16-201 is silent on a matter, the
 
hearings officer "may refer to the Hawaii Rules of Civil
 
Procedure for guidance." HAR § 16-201-1 (1990) (emphasis added). 
The Rules of Civil Procedure are therefore not binding in such
 
proceedings. Thus, the DCCA was not required to apply the
 
requirements of HRCP Rule 56(e) in considering the Partnership's
 
motion for summary judgment.
 
However, as it appears that the DCCA erroneously
 
dismissed the Association's claim for injunctive relief from
 
allegedly ongoing violations of the Covenant, we conclude that
 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the Circuit Court did not err in vacating the DCCA's order and
 
remanding the matter for further proceedings.
 
For these reasons, we affirm the Circuit Court's
 
December 14, 2007 Judgment on Appeal.
