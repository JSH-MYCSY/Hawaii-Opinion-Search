 HRS ยง 657-5 (Supp. 2010) provides in relevant part:
 
Unless an extension is granted, every judgment and
decree of any court of the State shall be presumed to be
paid and discharged at the expiration of ten years after the
judgment or decree was rendered. . . . No extension of a
judgment or decree shall be granted unless the extension is
sought within ten years of the date the original judgment or
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
 
On appeal, Gapasin contends that the extension was
 
erroneously granted because Plaintiffs-Appellees failed to
 
present admissible evidence necessary to overcome the statutory
 presumption that a ten-year old judgment has been paid.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 find no merit in Gapasin's argument.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the January 31, 2008 Order
 
entered in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, October 13, 2011.
