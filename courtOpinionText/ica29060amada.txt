APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT

ORDER OF CORRECTION
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, for the court1/)
The Memorandum Opinion, filed on June 30, 2010, is
hereby corrected as follows:
1. On page 15, in the first line from the top of the
page, the word "cirucit" is misspelled and should be corrected to
read "circuit" so that as corrected, the text reads as follows:
"and thus the circuit court did not . . . ."
2. On page 18, in the fourteenth line from the bottom
of the page, the word "evidence" was omitted from the beginning
of the quoted material and should be inserted before the word
"sufficient" in the quoted text so that as corrected, the text
reads as follows: "He failed to present "evidence sufficient to
support a finding . . . .""
The clerk of the court is directed to incorporate the
foregoing changes in the original opinion and take all necessary
steps to notify the publishing agencies of these changes.
