IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
DON WILLIAMS, Petitioner-Appellant,
v.
 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, DEPARTMENT OF LAND AND NATURAL
RESOURCES, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(S.P. NO. 07-1-0061(1))
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley, and Fujise, JJ.)
 
This appeal arises out of a dispute over lease rent 
between Plaintiff-Appellant Don Williams (Williams) as lessor and 
Respondent-Appellee State of Hawai 'i, Department of Land and 
Natural Resources (State) as lessee. For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that this court lacks jurisdiction over the issues raised by Williams in this appeal. We therefore dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction. 
I.
 
On September 1, 1994, Williams and the State entered
 
into Lease B-94-4 (Lease), for a term of 30 years, for real
 property totaling 1.137 acres on Maui. The Lease was signed on
 behalf of the State by Keith W. Ahue, the duly authorized
 Chairperson and Member of the Board of Land and Natural Resources
 (BLNR), and was approved by the BLNR. 
The Lease provides for the redetermination of the lease
 
rent every two years and further provides that if the parties
 cannot agree, then the rent shall be determined through an 
arbitration procedure set forth in the Lease. The parties could
 not resolve disputes over the lease rent for the terms beginning
 in September 2004 and September 2006.

A. Circuit Court Proceedings
 
On October 16, 2007, Williams initiated a special
 
proceeding, S.P. No. 07-1-0061(1), in the Circuit Court of the
 
Second Circuit (circuit court),1/ by filing an "Application: (i)

To Compel Compliance with Arbitration Agreement, (ii) For
 Designation and Appointment of Arbitrator, and (iii) For Award of
 Attorneys' Fees" (Williams's Application). Among other things,
 Williams sought an order from the circuit court directing the
 State to comply with the arbitration agreement in the Lease "by
 proceeding with arbitration conducted solely pursuant to the
 terms of the Lease for the purpose of determining" the market
 value of the leased premises as of September 1, 2004, and
 September 1, 2006. Williams also sought an order from the
 circuit court designating and appointing an arbitrator to act as
 the State's representative to make the market value determination
 for the September 1, 2006, term and directing the arbitrators to
 determine a series of questions.
 

 
The State opposed the Williams's Application and asked
that it be denied. 
The State argued that Williams's filing of
 
the Williams's Application was premature because 1) the State had
 notified Williams that its appraisal for the 2006 term would be
 completed by around the end of October 2007; 2) the State's 2006
 appraisal was, in fact, completed on the same day that the
 Williams's Application was filed; and 3) the State shortly
 thereafter communicated the results of the 2006 appraisal to
 Williams. The State also argued that the Williams's Application
 was unnecessary because the State had agreed to arbitration
 regarding the 2004 term and had expressed its willingness to
 discuss procedures for arbitrating the rents for the 2004 and
 2006 terms back to back. 
Williams filed a reply memorandum which noted that the
 
State had agreed that the rent determination for the 2004 and
 2006 terms could proceed to arbitration and had named its
 
1 The Honorable Joel E. August presided.
 
2
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
arbitrator for the 2006 term. Williams acknowledged that those
 
aspects of the Williams's Application were moot. Williams,
 however, asserted that the parties could not agree on the timing
 for the arbitrations on the 2004 and 2006 terms and on the issues
 to be decided by the arbitrators. Williams asked the circuit
 court for guidance and for relief on these disputed matters.
 
During a meeting with the arbitrators selected to
 
determine the lease rents, it became clear that the parties did
 not agree on the minimum rate of return that should be used in
 calculating the rent. The parties submitted supplemental briefs
 to the circuit court on whether the Lease had been modified to
 increase the minimum rate of return used to calculate the rent
 from 8 percent to 8.75 percent. Section 2.1 of the Lease, which
 contains the procedures for determining rent, provides that rent
 for each two-year term shall be the greater of:
 
(a) Eight percent (8%)(or the then prevailing rate of
return of land similar in type and location to the Premises,
whichever is greater), of the fair market value of the
Premises as determined by an independent appraisal. . .; or 
(b) the annual rental amount in effect during each of
the two (2) years immediately preceding the current two (2)
year segment.
 
(Emphasis added.) 
Williams argued that the Lease had been modified and
 
the minimum rate of return increased to 8.75 percent as reflected
 
in a letter, dated November 16, 1998, written by John Hino,
 Property Manager for the Division of Boating and Ocean Recreation
 for the Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR).
2/ In
 
that letter, Hino noted that based on his "office's
 interpretation," (1) the minimum value of the property was
 $2,230,000 and the minimum rate of return to calculate rent was
 8.75 percent and (2) "[i]t is understood that the value and rate
 of return can never be less than [these] amounts."
 
2 In his supplemental brief to the circuit court, Williams stated that
the parties had resolved their dispute over the timing of the arbitrations for
the 2004 and 2006 terms by agreeing to have the rents determined for bothterms in the same arbitration hearing. 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The State disputed Williams's contention that the Lease
 
had been modified to increase the minimum rate of return to 8.75
 
percent. The State argued that 1) the Lease provided that it
 could only be modified by a written agreement and that Hino's
 letter did not constitute a written agreement; 2) Hino had no
 authority to amend the Lease; and 3) the BLNR, the only entity
 with the power and authority to amend the Lease, had not approved
 any change to the minimum 8 percent rate of return set forth in
 the original Lease.
 
On February 11, 2008, the circuit court issued an order
 
denying the Williams's Application and further ordering that
 "the: (a) minimum rate of return under the Lease remains eight
 percent (8%); and (b) matters submitted to the Arbitrators for
 the 2004 and 2006 rent reopening are: 1) the applicable rate of
 return; and 2) the fair market value of the Premises as defined
 in section 1.3(b) of the Lease" (February 11, 2008, Order).
 
Williams filed a motion for reconsideration of the
 
February 11, 2008, Order. On April 3, 2008, the circuit court
 issued an order denying Williams's motion for reconsideration of
 the February 11, 2008, Order (Order Denying Motion for
 Reconsideration).
 
On April 18, 2008, Williams filed a notice of appeal
 
from the February 11, 2008, Order and the Order Denying Motion
 for Reconsideration.
 
On April 29, 2008, in the same circuit court special
 
proceeding, S.P. No. 07-1-0061(1), the State filed an
 "Application: (i) To Compel Arbitration; (ii) To Impose Sanctions
 Against [Williams] for Any Further Delay in the Start of
 Arbitration Proceedings; and (iii) For Award of Attorney's Fees
 and Costs Against [Williams]" (State's Application). The State
 contended that Williams was "delaying and refusing to proceed
 with the very same arbitration proceeding" for which [Williams]
 filed an application to compel. The State asked the circuit
 court to compel Williams to immediately begin the arbitration
 proceedings and to impose sanctions, including costs and
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
attorney's fees, against Williams. Williams opposed the State's
 
Application on the ground that he had appealed the February 11,
 2008, Order and wanted to resolve the appeal before proceeding
 with arbitration.
 
On June 5, 2008, the circuit court issued an order
 
granting the State's Application in part. The circuit court
 granted the State's request to compel arbitration, but denied
 without prejudice the request for attorney's fees and costs (June
 5, 2008, Order). On June 18, 2008, Williams filed a notice of
 appeal from the June 5, 2008, Order.
 
B. Proceedings in this Court
 
As noted, Williams filed a notice of appeal from the
 
February 11, 2008, Order and the Order Denying Motion for
 Reconsideration. This appeal was designated as Appeal No. 29115
 and is the appeal that is presently before this court. Williams
 also filed a notice of appeal from the June 5, 2008, Order, which
 was designated as Appeal No. 29209.
 
The State moved this court to dismiss Williams's appeal
 
in the instant appeal (Appeal No. 29115). The State argued that
 this court did not have jurisdiction because the orders appealed
 from were not appealable orders or judgments. Williams filed a
 memorandum in opposition.
 
On September 26, 2008, we granted in part and denied in
 
part, the State's motion to dismiss. We stated that "[w]hen a
 party appeals from a circuit court order regarding an arbitration
 issue, there are two statutes that can potentially authorize an
 appeal: (1) Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1(a) (1993 &
 Supp. 2007), and (2) HRS ยง 658A-28 (Supp. 2007)." Citing Jenkins
 v. Cades Shutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai'i 115, 869 P.2d 1334
 (1994), we concluded that "[t]he circuit court has not yet
 entered a final judgment" and thus an appeal could not be
 maintained pursuant to HRS ยง 641-1(a).
 
We noted that HRS ยง 658A-28(a)(1) authorizes an appeal
 
from "an order denying a motion to compel arbitration." 
(Brackets omitted.) We therefore concluded that the February 11,
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
2008, Order was an appealable order under HRS ยง 658A-28(a)(1) to
 
the extent that it denied Williams's motion to compel
 arbitration.
 
In a footnote, we stated:
 
We have no appellate jurisdiction to review the circuit
court's February 11, 2008, [O]rder to the extent that it
determined: (a) a minimum rate of return under the Lease;
and (b) the matter to be submitted to the Arbitrators.
Therefore, Williams may challenge these pre-arbitration
rulings of the court in conjunction with an appeal, if any,
from an order confirming arbitration award or other such
final order or judgment in this case.
 
On October 17, 2008, this court issued an order 
dismissing Appeal No. 29209, in which Williams appealed from the 
circuit court's June 5, 2008, Order, for lack of appellate jurisdiction. We concluded that the June 5, 2008, Order was not appealable pursuant to HRS ยง 641-1(a) because that statute only permits appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Citing Jenkins and the requirement of Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP) Rule 58 (1990) that [e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document[,]" we determined that the circuit court had not yet entered a final judgment in the case. We further concluded that the June 5, 2008, Order was not appealable pursuant to HRS ยง 658A-28 and that no exceptions to the final judgment requirement applied. We ruled that "[a]bsent an appealable final order or judgment, Appellant Williams's appeal is premature and we lack appellate jurisdiction." (Emphasis added.)

A.
 
In Excelsior Lodge Number One, Independent Order of Odd 
Fellows v. Eyecor, Ltd., 74 Haw. 210, 847 P.2d 652 (1992), the Hawai
'i Supreme Court indicated that a trial court's pre-
arbitration ruling should be appealed in connection with an appeal of an order compelling arbitration. In Excelsior Lodge, 
6
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
3/
the lessor filed a special proceeding  seeking to compel
arbitration to determine the lease rent according to the
 
agreement contained in the master lease. Id. at 215, 847 P.2d at
 655. The lessee and sublessee (collectively, "lessee") opposed
 the lessor's request, arguing that a statutory rent ceiling
 applied to the rent determination because the sublessee was a
 cooperative housing corporation. Id. The trial court granted
 the lessor's motion and entered an order compelling the parties
 to follow the master lease arbitration procedure. Id. at 216,
 847 P.2d at 656. Lessee did not appeal from the order compelling
 arbitration, and the arbitration process went forward. Id. 
During the arbitration, the lessee filed a motion with the trial
 court seeking a ruling prohibiting the arbitrators from setting a
 rental amount in excess of the statutory rent ceiling
 requirement. Id. The trial court ruled that the rent ceiling
 requirement was not applicable. Id. 
The arbitrators subsequently awarded the lessor rent in

 
excess of statutory rent ceiling. Id. at 216, 222, 847 P.2d at
 
656, 658. The lessor filed a motion to confirm the arbitration
 award, which the trial court granted. Id. at 217, 847 P.2d at
 
656. The lessee appealed from the order compelling arbitration,
 
the order ruling that the rent ceiling requirement was not
 applicable (rent-ceiling order), and the order confirming the
 arbitration award (confirmation order). Id. at 218, 847 P.2d at
 
656.
 
The supreme court held that the lessee could not
 
challenge the confirmation order by seeking to change the award
 to reduce the award to the statutory rent ceiling amount because
 it had failed to timely bring a motion to vacate, modify, or
 
3 We believe that the lessor filed a special proceeding based on the
description of the proceedings and because this court noted that lessor had
filed "S.P. 90-00666" in our decision in Excelsior Lodge, 9 Haw. App. 354,359, 847 P.2d 667, 670 (1992), a decision that was subsequently reversed bythe Hawai' i Supreme Court. We understand the "S.P." designation to refer to a
special proceeding. 
7
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
correct the award. Id. at 222-23, 847 P.2d at 658.4/
 The
 
supreme court further held that because the lessee had failed to
 
timely challenge the arbitration award, the lessee had no means
 of overturning the confirmation order, and thus its appeal of the
 rent-ceiling order was moot. Id. at 229, 847 P.2d at 661. 
With respect to the order compelling arbitration, the

 
supreme court concluded that this was an appealable collateral
 order that the lessee should have immediately appealed. Id. at
 
230-33, 847 P.2d at 662-63. The court stated, "Given its
 principal claim that the provisions of [the rent ceiling statute]
 apply to the instant arbitration, [lessee] should have
 immediately appealed the trial court's initial decision to compel
 arbitration in order to have the issue settled at the most
 opportune time in the dispute." Id. at 233, 847 P.2d at 663. 
The court noted that the lessee had previously filed an appeal
 from the order compelling arbitration that had been dismissed as
 untimely because the lessee had waited more than thirty days to
 appeal that order. Id. at 232-33, 847 P.2d at 662. The court
 
held that "a reviewing court shall not consider an unappealed 
. . . order compelling arbitration on an appeal from a final
 judgment in the same case." Id. at 234, 847 P.2d at 663.
 
B.
 
We note that Excelsior Lodge was decided before the 
Hawai
'i Supreme Court's decision in Jenkins. In Jenkins, the 
supreme court prospectively commanded strict compliance with the separate document requirement of HRCP Rule 58 for subsequently filed appeals and required that an appeal from a order that purports to be a final order may be taken only after the order has been reduced to separate judgment. Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 
118-20, 869 P.2d at 1337-39. Prior to Jenkins, the supreme court 
4 The supreme court noted that even if a party files a motion to vacate,
modify, or correct an arbitration award, that party's appeal would be limited
to a consideration of the specific grounds authorized by the arbitration
statute for challenging an arbitration award. Excelsior Lodge, 74 Haw. at 227
 
n.16, 847 P.2d at 660 n.16. 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
had permitted appeals from orders that had not been reduced to a
 
separate judgment. See id. 
Because Excelsior Lodge was decided pre-Jenkins, the 
court may not have focused on the separate judgment requirement. The court also may not have focused on whether an order compelling arbitration issued in a special proceeding brought to compel arbitration qualifies as a collateral order, since that was not an issue raised by the parties. See State v. Wheeler, 
121 Hawai
'i 383, 399, 219 P.3d 1170, 1186 (2009) (concluding that 
for purposes of stare decisis, the holdings of cases "are limited to issues that were actually decided by the court"). 
Where a motion to compel arbitration is made during the 
course of a broader lawsuit seeking relief on various causes of action, the order compelling arbitration is properly viewed as collateral order that is independently appealable without a separate judgment. See Association of Owners of Kukui Plaza v. Swinerton & Walberg Co., 68 Haw. 98, 102-07, 705 P.2d 28, 32-35 (1985); Douglas v. Pflueger Hawaii, Inc., 110 Hawai
'i 520, 522 & 
n.1, 523, 135 P.3d 129, 131 & n.1, 132 (2006). However, where a motion to compel arbitration is brought in a special proceeding whose purpose is to determine whether arbitration is required, an order compelling arbitration does not qualify as a collateral order because it does not "determine claims of right separable from and collateral to, rights asserted in the action." Kukui Plaza, 68 Haw at 105, 705 P.2d at 34 (quoting Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 546 (1949)). Instead, in such a special proceeding, like the one instituted in this case, the order compelling arbitration decides rights directly asserted in and integral to the action and thus must be reduced to a separate judgment, pursuant to Jenkins, before an appeal can be taken. 
III.

 
In our prior order granting in part and denying in part
 
the State's motion to dismiss this appeal, we ruled that we had
 jurisdiction over Williams's appeal from the circuit court's
 February 11, 2008, Order to the extent that this order denied
 
9
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Williams's motion to compel arbitration. However, Williams does
 
not argue in this appeal that the circuit court erred in denying
 his request to compel arbitration. 
In our prior order partially granting and denying the
 
State's motion to dismiss, we specifically stated that "[w]e have
 no appellate jurisdiction to review the circuit court's February
 11, 2008, [O]rder to the extent that it determined: (a) a minimum
 rate of return under the Lease; and (b) the matter to be
 submitted to the Arbitrators." The only issues raised by
 Williams in this appeal concern the circuit court's pre-
arbitration decision regarding the minimum rate of return under
 the Lease. With respect to the issues raised by Williams in this
 appeal, the February 11, 2008, [O]rder was a non-final, non-
appealable order. Thus, we lack jurisdiction to consider the
 issues raised by Williams in this appeal, and we dismiss this
 appeal for lack of jurisdiction.
 
We note that Excelsior Lodge authorizes Williams to
 
challenge the circuit court's ruling on the minimum rate of
 return in connection with an appeal of the circuit court's June
 5, 2008, Order, which granted the State's request to compel
 arbitration. See Excelsior Lodge, 74 Haw. at 233, 847 P.2d at
 663.
5/ We dismissed Williams's appeal of the June 5, 2008, Order
 
in Appeal No. 29209 as premature because no separate final
 judgment had been entered. Under our ruling, which was based on
 Jenkins, Williams could have perfected and perhaps still can
 perfect his right to appeal by having the circuit court enter a
 final judgment on its June 5, 2008, Order. It appears that so
 far, Williams has failed to do so.
 
5 To the extent we suggested that Williams could obtain review of the
circuit court's pre-arbitration ruling on the minimum rate of return in an
appeal from an order confirming the arbitration award, that appears to be
incorrect. See Excelsior Lodge, 74 Haw. at 233-34, 847 P.2d at 663.

For the foregoing reasons, we dismiss Williams's
 
instant appeal (Appeal No. 29115) for lack of appellate
 
jurisdiction.
