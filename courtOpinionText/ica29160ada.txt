OPINION OF THE COURT BY FOLEY, PRESIDING J.
 
Plaintiffs-Appellants Kewalo Ocean Activities and

Judgment as to All Claims and All Parties (Judgment) filed on
 May 5, 2008 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
court).1 The circuit court entered judgment in favor of 
Defendants-Appellees Anthony J.H. Ching (Ching), in his official 
capacity as Executive Director of the Hawaii Community Development Authority (HCDA), and Brennon T. Morioka (Morioka), in his official capacity as Director of the Department of Transportation of the State of Hawaii (DOT)
2 (collectively, State 
Defendants) and against KOA and dismissed KOA's Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (Complaint) with prejudice. The circuit court issued the Judgment pursuant to the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting Defendant State of Hawai» i's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings or, in the 
Alternative, for Summary Judgment as to Plaintiffs' Complaint Filed August 7, 2007" (FOF/COL/Order) filed on March 25, 2008. 
On appeal, KOA argues that the circuit court
 
(1) erred in impliedly concluding that Hawaii Revised
 
Statutes (HRS) ÿÿ 206E-4 (1993) authorized HCDA to enact rules
 with regard to Kewalo Basin Harbor (the Harbor)
3;
 
(2) erred when it disregarded the plain language of
 
HRS Chapter 266 and instead relied upon the legislative history
 of 1991 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 272, at 607, (Act 272) to conclude
 that DOT does not have jurisdiction over the Harbor;
 
(3) alternatively, erred in basing its conclusion that
 
DOT does not have jurisdiction over the Harbor on legislative
 
history, when the legislative history does not suggest that the
 Harbor is to be excluded from the category of "commercial
 harbors";

 The Honorable Karen S.S. Ahn presided.

 Although in KOA's Complaint, KOA named as defendants Daniel Dinell,
in his official capacity as Executive Director of HCDA, and Barry Fukunaga, in
his official capacity as Director of DOT, by the time the circuit court filed
its FOF/COL/Order, Ching and Morioka had become HCDA Executive Director and
acting Director of DOT, respectively, and the court substituted them as
parties for the former directors.
 
3
 On appeal, the parties refer to Kewalo Basin Harbor and Kewalo Basin
interchangeably. For the sake of simplicity, throughout our discussion, we
refer to it as the Harbor. 
2
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(4) erred in concluding that DOT's jurisdiction and
 
powers are subject to restrictions imposed by HCDA statutes (HRS
 
Chapter 206E);
 
(5) erred in concluding that construing the statutes
 
to grant HCDA jurisdiction over the Kakaako Community Development
 District (Kakaako District), while maintaining DOT's jurisdiction
 over the Harbor, would lead to an absurd result; and
 
(6) erred in concluding that "the relevant sections of
 
HRS [C]hapter 206E are the more specific provisions and the
 relevant sections of HRS [C]hapter 266 are the more general
 provisions."
 
KOA asks that we vacate the FOF/COL/Order and "reverse
 
and remand" this case to the circuit court. We affirm the
 circuit court's Judgment because we conclude, inter alia, that
 
HCDA has jurisdiction and administrative authority over the
 development of the Harbor pursuant to HRS Chapter 206E.
I.
 
The FOF/COL/Order provides the following factual
 
background, which is undisputed:
 
FINDINGS OF FACT
 
. . . . 
2. In 1976, HCDA was established by the [State of
Hawai»i (State)] legislature to facilitate the redevelopment
of certain underdeveloped and blighted areas within the
State. 
3. In 1990, title to lands within the [Kakaako
District], which includes [the Harbor], was conveyed to HCDA
by the legislature pursuant to Act 86 (1990) (HRS ÿÿ 206E­
31).
 
4. Prior to 1990, the DOT operated and managed all
harbors in the State, including [the Harbor].
 
5. In 1991, one year after the legislature conveyed
title to [the Harbor] to HCDA, the legislature enacted Act
272 (1991), in which it amended parts of HRS [C]hapter 266
to clarify that the DOT had care and control of all
commercial harbors in the State. [The Harbor] meets the
definition of a commercial harbor.
 
6. HCDA currently holds title to lands underlying
[the Harbor]. The DOT currently operates and manages [the
Harbor].
 
7. The HCDA has publicly announced its intention to
transfer management and operation of [the Harbor] from the
DOT to the HCDA, has held public hearings, and has issued
 
3
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
proposed administrative rules regarding the proposed
transfer.
 
8. [KOA] filed [its Complaint] herein on August 7,
2007, challenging the proposed transfer of authority,
operations and management of [the Harbor] from the DOT to
the HCDA, as well as HCDA's proposed administrative rules in
connection therewith, alleging that those actions are not
authorized by statute, and are in violation of [HRS].
 
On November 28, 2007, the State Defendants filed a
 
Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings or, in the Alternative, for
 
Summary Judgment as to [KOA's Complaint]" (the State's MSJ). The
 State Defendants argued that the legislature had given HCDA the
 authority to manage the Harbor, which authority subsequent
 legislative action confirmed. KOA filed a memorandum in
 opposition, and the State Defendants filed a reply. On
 January 11, 2008, the State Defendants filed a supplemental
 memorandum in support of their motion. KOA filed a supplemental
 memorandum in support of its opposition.
 
After a February 19, 2008 hearing on the State's MSJ, 
the circuit court filed its FOF/COL/Order in March 2008. The
 
circuit court characterized the issue as "whether, in 1976, the
 State legislature intended to transfer jurisdiction and
 administrative authority from DOT to HCDA for lands underlying
 [the Harbor], the title for which is held by HCDA." Based in
 part on HRS Chapters 206E and 266 and the legislative history
 underlying 2006 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 165, at 653 (Act 165) and Act
 272, the circuit court granted the State's MSJ and dismissed the
 
Complaint with prejudice.
 
Citing to HRS ÿÿÿÿ 206E-4, 206E-31 (2001 Repl.), 206E­
31.5 (Supp. 2009), and 206E-33 (2001 Repl.), the circuit court
 
stated in its Conclusions of Law (COLs) in the FOF/COL/Order that
 it was "undisputed that, as part of setting up the [Kakaako
 District], the legislature granted to HCDA title to [the Harbor]
 including submerged lands" and "appropriated to HCDA broad powers
 to plan for and carry out the redevelopment of the district,
 without exception, on a comprehensive and long-term basis." The
 circuit court went on to state the following in its COLs:
 
11. It is true that the legislature has not
specifically addressed its intent regarding the
administrative jurisdiction of [the Harbor] as between the
 
4
   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
DOT and HCDA. It also is true that the legislature has left
HRS Chapter 266 to say that the DOT shall operate and
maintain all commercial harbors controlled by the State.
[The Harbor] meets the definition of a commercial harbor.
One year after it deeded Kakaako District to HCDA, the
legislature enacted Act 272 (1991), in which it amended
parts of HRS [C]hapter 266 to clarify that the DOT had care
and control of all "commercial" harbors in the State. 
However, Act 272's legislative history suggests that these
changes were made in the context of the legislature's
transfer of the boating and coastal areas programs to
another state department, while maintaining authority over
commercial harbors within the DOT. The court also notes
 that HRS Chapter 266 makes clear that the powers of the
[DOT] are subject to limitations imposed by other statutes.
 
12. All of what we have discussed being so, to the
extent at issue here, HRS [C]hapters 266 and 206E appear torelate to the same subject matter. Pursuant to [State v. 
Batson, 99 Hawai
»i 118, 120, 53 P.3d 257, 259 (2002)], we
presume all legislative acts to be valid. The court has reviewed both sets of provisions in an effort to try to readthem together or to seek clarification of whether thelegislature intended to give HCDA title to the landunderlying [the Harbor] but not jurisdiction therefor. The 
court cannot so conclude, for to do so would lead to anabsurd result, to wit, that the legislature wanted HCDA to
comprehensively and for the long-term plan, renew, and
redevelop the Kakaako "District," [sic] which specifically
includes [the Harbor], and yet did not want HCDA to be ableto touch any of the Basin's improvements. This seems 
illogical and inconsistent with the legislature's broad
mandate and objectives with respect to HCDA and the KakaakoDistrict. 
19. [sic]
4 Finally, the court concludes that the
relevant sections of HRS [C]hapter 206E are the more
specific provisions and the relevant sections of HRS
[C]hapter 266 are the more general provisions.
 
(Footnote added.)

A. SUMMARY JUDGMENT
 
An appellate court "reviews an award of summary
judgment under the same standard applied by the circuit
court." Yoneda v. Tom, 110 Hawai »i 367, 371, 133 P.3d 796,
800 (2006) (citation omitted). Thus, this court reviews the
circuit court's grant or denial of summary judgment de novo. 
Sierra Club v. Dep't of Transp., 115 Hawai
»i 299, 312, 167
P.3d 292, 305 (2007). Moreover,
 
summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and
admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if
any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any
material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law. A fact is material if
 
4
 The COL is incorrectly numbered "19," when it should be "13."
Throughout this opinion, we refer to the COL as "COL 13."
 
5 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
proof of that fact would have the effect of
establishing or refuting one of the essential elements
of a cause of action or defense asserted by the
parties. The evidence must be viewed in the light
most favorable to the non-moving party. In other
 
words, we must view all of the evidence and the
inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable
to the party opposing the motion.

B. STATUTORY INTERPRETATION
 
"The interpretation of a statute is a question of law
 
which this court reviews de novo." Sierra Club v. Dep't of
 
Transp. of State of Hawai» i, 120 Hawai» i 181, 197, 202 P.3d 1226, 
1242 (2009) (quoting Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Dennison, 108
 
Hawai» i 380, 384, 120 P.3d 1115, 1119 (2005)). 
The Hawai» i Supreme Court has established the following 
principles for interpreting a statute:
 
First, the fundamental starting point for
statutory interpretation is the language of the
statute itself. Second, where the statutory language
is plain and unambiguous, our sole duty is to give
effect to its plain and obvious meaning. Third,
implicit in the task of statutory construction is our
foremost obligation to ascertain and give effect to
the intention of the legislature, which is to be
obtained primarily from the language contained in the
statute itself. Fourth, when there is doubt,
doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness or
uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, an
ambiguity exists. And fifth, in construing an
ambiguous statute, the meaning of the ambiguous words
may be sought by examining the context, with which the
ambiguous words, phrases, and sentences may be
compared, in order to ascertain their true meaning.
 
Awakuni v. Awana, 115 Hawai
»i 126, 133, 165 P.3d 1027, 1034
(2007) (citation omitted). This court has also instructed that statutory language must be read "in the context of theentire statute and construe[d] in a manner consistent with
its purpose." Hous. Fin. & Dev. Corp. v. Castle, 79 Hawai
»i 
64, 77, 898 P.2d 576, 589 (1995) (citation omitted). The 
same general principles that apply to statutory
interpretation also apply to interpretation of
administrative rules. Allstate Ins. Co. v. Ponce, 105 
Hawai»i 445, 454, 99 P.3d 96, 105 (2004) (citation omitted). 
Unite Here! , 123 Hawai» i at 170-71, 231 P.3d at 443-44. 
The supreme court has adopted a three-step approach 
when interpreting statutes that appear to relate to the same
 
subject matter:
 
6
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
First, legislative enactments are presumptively
valid and "should be interpreted [in such a manner as]
to give them effect." State v. Spencer, 68 Haw. 622,
624, 725 P.2d 799, 800 (1986) (citation omitted).
Second, "[l]aws in pari materia, or upon the same
subject matter, shall be construed with reference to
each other. What is clear in one statute may be
called in aid to explain what is doubtful in another."
HRS § 1-16 (1985); Kam v. Noh, 70 Haw. 321, 325, 770
P.2d 414, 417 (1989). Third, "where there is a
'plainly irreconcilable' conflict between a general
and a specific statute concerning the same subject
matter, the specific will be favored. However, where
the statutes simply overlap in their application,
effect will be given to both if possible, as repeal by
implication is disfavored." Mahiai v. Suwa, 69 Haw.
 
349, 356-57, 742 P.2d 359, 366 (1987) (citations
omitted).
 
Richardson v. City and County of Honolulu, 76 Hawai
»i 46,
54-55, 868 P.2d 1193, 1201-02, reconsideration denied, 76 
Hawai»i 247, 871 P.2d 795 (1994), judgment aff'd 124 F.3d 
1150 (9th Cir. 1997) (brackets in original). 
State v. Batson , 99 Hawai» i 118, 120, 53 P.3d 257, 259 (2002).
C. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
 
A trial court's conclusion of law
 
is not binding upon an appellate court and is freely
reviewable for its correctness. This court ordinarily
reviews [conclusions of law] under the right/wrong
standard. Thus, a [conclusion of law] that is
supported by the trial court's findings of fact and
that reflects an application of the correct rule of
law will not be overturned. However, a [conclusion of
law] that presents mixed questions of fact and law is
reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard because
the court's conclusions are dependent upon the facts
and circumstances of each individual case.
 
State v. Reis, 115 Hawai
»i 79, 84, 165 P.3d 980, 985 (2007)
(internal quotation marks, citations, and original brackets
omitted) (quoting Allstate Ins. Co. v. Ponce, 105 Hawai »i 
445, 453, 99 P.3d 96, 104 (2004)). 
Sierra Club , 120 Hawai» i at 196, 202 P.3d at 1241. 
III.
 
The issue in this case is whether HCDA has jurisdiction
 
and administrative authority (authority) over the development of
 
the Harbor. The circuit court entered its Judgment pursuant to
 the FOF/COL/Order, in which the court granted the State's MSJ and
 dismissed with prejudice KOA's Complaint. In the State's MSJ,
 the State Defendants argued that there was no genuine issue of
 
material fact regarding whether the proposed transfer of
 
authority over the Harbor from DOT to HCDA, as well as HCDA's
 proposed administrative rules in connection therewith, were
 
7
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
authorized by statute because the legislature gave HCDA the
 
authority to manage the Harbor.
A. PLAIN LANGUAGE
 
KOA contends the circuit court erred in granting the
 
State's MSJ because based on the clear and unambiguous language
 of HRS ÿÿÿÿ 266-1 (2007 Repl.) and 266-2(b) (2007 Repl.), DOT has
 exclusive authority over the Harbor. KOA cites to State v. Klie ,
 
116 Hawai» i 519, 174 P.3d 358 (2007), to support this argument. 
There, the Hawai» i Supreme Court stated: 
We cannot change the language of the statute, supply a want,
or enlarge upon it in order to make it suit a certain state
of facts. We do not legislate or make laws. Even when the
 
court is convinced in its own mind that the legislature
really meant and intended something not expressed by the
phraseology of the act, it has no authority to depart from
the plain meaning of the language used.
 
Id. at 525, 174 P.3d at 364 (brackets in original omitted) 
(quoting State v. Sakamoto , 101 Hawai» i 409, 413, 70 P.3d 635, 
639 (2003)). 
HRS ÿÿ 266-1 provides that "[a]ll commercial harbors and
 
roadsteads, and all commercial harbor and waterfront improvements
 
belonging to or controlled by the State, and all vessels and
 shipping within the commercial harbors and roadsteads shall be
 under the care and control of the [DOT]." HRS ÿÿ 266-2(b)
 provides in relevant part that "[n]otwithstanding any law or
 provision to the contrary, the [DOT] is authorized to plan,
 construct, operate, and maintain any commercial harbor facility
 in the State[.]"
1. Language of HRS ÿÿÿÿ 266-1 and 266-2(b) alone
 
Although KOA urges us to consider the language of HRS
 
ÿÿÿÿ 266-1 and 266-2(b) in isolation, the issue in this case is
 
whether HCDA or DOT has authority over the Harbor, and we must
 also consider the language of HRS Chapter 206E, which concerns
 HCDA's authority over Kakaako District, among other things. HRS
 ÿÿÿÿ 206E-31, 206E-32 (2001 Repl.), and 206E-33. When juxtaposed
 with HRS ÿÿÿÿ 206E-31 through 206-33, HRS ÿÿÿÿ 266-1 and 266-2(b) are
 
not clear and unambiguous with regard to which entity has
 authority over the Harbor. HRS ÿÿ 266-1 provides DOT with
 jurisdiction over all state commercial harbors. HRS ÿÿ 266-1
 
8
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
("All commercial harbors . . . shall be under the care and
 
control of the [DOT]."). Chapter 206E mandates that HCDA
 redevelop Kakaako District, including the Harbor, which is a
 commercial harbor. HRS ÿÿÿÿ 206E-2(4) (2001 Repl.), 206E-31, 206E­32, and 206E-33. As the circuit court rightly suggested in its
 COLs, HRS Chapters 266 and 206E concern the same subject matter.
2. "Notwithstanding" language in HRS ÿÿ 266-2(b)
 
KOA argues that the phrase "[n]otwithstanding any law 
or provision to the contrary" in HRS ÿÿ 266-2(b) means that the DOT statutes govern over and supersede the HCDA statutes. KOA cites to the following published cases to support this contention: State v. Smith, 103 Hawai» i 228, 231, 81 P.3d 408, 
411 (2003); Klie; Cisneros v. Alpine Ridge Group, 508 U.S. 10, 18, 113 S. Ct. 1898, 1900 (1993); and Campbell v. Minneapolis Pub. Hous. Auth. ex rel. City of Minneapolis, 168 F.3d 1069, 1075 
(8th Cir. 1999). 
In Smith , the circuit court convicted Smith of 
Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the Third Degree, in violation of 
HRS ÿÿ 712-1243, and Unlawful Use of Drug Paraphernalia, in violation of HRS ÿÿ 329-43.5(a). Smith , 103 Hawai» i at 229, 81 
P.3d at 409. The issue was whether the circuit court should sentence Smith pursuant to HRS ÿÿ 706-606.5(1) (1993 & Supp. 2002), regarding sentencing of repeat offenders, 103 Hawai» i at 
229 & n.3, 81 P.3d at 409 & n.3, or HRS ÿÿ 706-622.5 (Supp. 2002), 
regarding sentencing for first-time drug offenders. 103 Hawai» i 
at 229-30 & 230 n.4, 81 P.3d at 409-10 & 410 n.4. Noting that Smith had "admitted to substantial ice use over a substantial period of time," and had "been in several drug treatment programs" and "either absconded or failed to comply," the circuit court sentenced Smith as a repeat offender, pursuant to HRS ÿÿ 706-606.5. 103 Hawai » i at 231, 81 P.3d at 411. HRS ÿÿ 706­
606.5(1) provided in relevant part: "Notwithstanding section 706-669 and any other law to the contrary, any person convicted of . . . any of the following class C felonies: . . . 712-1243 relating to promoting a dangerous drug in the third degree . . . 
9
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
shall be sentenced to a mandatory minimum period of imprisonment
 
without possibility of parole[.]"
 
Smith filed a motion for reconsideration of the
 
sentence, arguing that she should have been sentenced pursuant to
 HRS ÿÿ 706-622.5 (Supp. 2002), which according to its plain
 language, she argued, "overrode" HRS ÿÿ 706-606.5. 103 Hawai » i at 
232, 81 P.3d at 412. HRS ÿÿ 706-622.5 provided in relevant part:
 
(1) Notwithstanding any penalty or sentencing provision
under part IV of chapter 712, a person convicted for the
first time for any offense under part IV of chapter 712
involving possession or use, not including to distribute or
manufacture as defined in section 712-1240, of any dangerous
drug, detrimental drug, harmful drug, intoxicating compound,
marijuana, or marijuana concentrate, as defined in section
712-1240, or involving possession or use of drug
paraphernalia under section 329-43.5, who is nonviolent, as
determined by the court . . . shall be sentenced in
accordance with subsection (2) . . . to probation[.]
 
At a hearing on Smith's motion, the circuit court
 
stated that "when the legislature provided for treatment for
 
first-time drug offenders, they did not mean to preclude the
 application of repeat offender sentencing." 103 Hawai» i at 232, 
81 P.3d at 412. The circuit court then denied the motion. Id.
 
Smith appealed, and the Supreme Court of Hawai» i 
affirmed the circuit court's decision on the following grounds:
 
In the present matter, HRS § 706-606.5(1) states that
the repeat offender statute applies "[n]otwithstanding . . .
any other law to the contrary . . . ." See supra note 3. 
Although HRS § 706-622.5 does contain a similar phrase, the
language of the first-time drug offender statute, as
compared to the foregoing wording of the repeat offender
statute, is markedly narrower in scope: "Notwithstanding
any penalty or sentencing provision under part IV of chapter
 712 . . . ." See supra note 4 (emphasis added). Thus,
inasmuch as the plain and unambiguous language of HRS § 706­
606.5 requires application of the repeat offender statute
over "any other law to the contrary," we hold that the
circuit court did not err in sentencing Smith as a repeat
offender pursuant to HRS § 706-606.5.
 
Id. at 234, 81 P.3d at 414.
 
In Klie, the State charged Klie with Street
 
Solicitation of Prostitution, in violation of HRS ÿÿ 712-1207(1). 
Klie, 116 Hawai» i at 520, 174 P.3d at 359. Klie pled no contest, 
which plea the District Court of the First Circuit (district
 court) accepted. Id. Klie then moved for a Deferred Acceptance
 
of No Contest (DANC) plea pursuant to HRS ÿÿ 853-1 (1993 & Supp.
 
10
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2009), arguing that pursuant to HRS ÿÿ 712-1207(5) (Supp. 2009), 
he was entitled to probation. 116 Hawai» i at 520-21, 174 P.3d at 
359-60. HRS ÿÿ 712-1207(5) provided that "[a]s an option to the mandatory term of thirty days imprisonment, if the court finds the option is warranted based upon the defendant's record, the court may place the defendant on probation for a period not to exceed six months." The State argued that because HRS ÿÿ 712­1207(4) (Supp. 2009) provided that "[n]otwithstanding any law to the contrary," the court "shall" sentence the defendant to imprisonment or, in the alternative, to probation, the court had no discretion to impose any other sentence. 116 Hawai» i at 521, 
174 P.3d at 360. The district court denied the motion on the basis that the court did not have the discretion to accept a DANC plea from Klie. Id. 
Klie appealed to this court, arguing that because "the 
offense charged is probationable, DANC pleas may be considered by 
the district sentencing court." Id. (brackets omitted). We 
affirmed the district court's decision. Id. Klie applied for a 
writ of certiorari, which the Hawai» i Supreme Court granted. Id. 
Based on HRS § 853-4(5) (Supp. 2005), which provided that DANC pleas did not apply when "[t]he offense charged is nonprobationable," the supreme court vacated the district court's decision and remanded the case. 116 Hawai» i at 522 & 526, 174 
P.3d at 361 & 365. The supreme court held that "[b]y the express 
terms of subsections (4) and (5), the offense under HRS § 712­1207 is probationable and, thus, is not excludable under HRS § 853-4(5)." 116 Hawai» i at 523, 174 P.3d at 362. 
Smith and Klie are inapplicable to this case. Here,
 
despite the "notwithstanding" language in HRS ÿÿ 266-2(b), ÿÿ 266-4
 (2007 Repl.) provides the following limitation on DOT's authority
 over commercial harbors: "The jurisdiction and powers conferred
 on the [DOT] are subject to such restrictions as may be imposed
 by the statutes of the State, and shall be exercised in
 accordance with the provisions thereof."
 
Chapter 206E also imposes a limitation on DOT's
 
authority over the Harbor. Under HRS ÿÿ 206E-4(5) (1993), the
 
11
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
legislature endowed HCDA with the power to "[m]ake rules with
 
respect to its projects," and the Harbor constitutes a "project"
 pursuant to ÿÿ 206E-2(4), which defines "project" as
 
a specific work or improvement, including real and personal
properties, or any interest therein, acquired, owned,
constructed, reconstructed, rehabilitated, or improved by
the [HCDA], including a residential project, a redevelopment
project, or a commercial project, all as defined herein, or
any combination thereof[.]
 
Further evidence that the "notwithstanding" language in HRS
 
ÿÿ 266-2(b) does not necessarily mean that statute controls is the
 
legislature's passing of Act 165, giving DOT authority over Piers
 1 and 2. If KOA's argument on this point were correct, passing
 Act 165 would not have been necessary. 
We find the other published cases to which KOA cites
 
inapplicable, as well. See Cisneros, 508 U.S. at 12, 113 S. Ct.
 
at 1900 (regarding whether § 801 of the Department of Housing and
 Urban Development Reform Act of 1989, 103 Stat. 2057, violates
 the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment by abrogating
 respondents' contract rights to certain rental subsidies);
 Campbell , 168 F.3d at 1070-71 (regarding whether the United
 
States District Court for the District of Minnesota properly
 enjoined Minneapolis Public Housing Authority's (MPHA) challenged
 practices of inquiring into public housing applicants' chemical-
dependency treatment histories and requiring applicants to
 
release such records to MPHA, where the MPHA had denied an
 applicant's motion for class certification in applicant's action
 
against MPHA).
 
3. Explicit language of HRS Chapter 266
 
KOA maintains that HCDA does not have authority over
 
the Harbor because Chapter 266 does not explicitly state that
 
HCDA has such authority and Chapter 266 does not even include the
 phrases "commercial harbor" or "management of commercial harbor." 
Despite the fact that Chapter 266 does not explicitly confer
 authority over the Harbor on HCDA or include the phrases to which
 KOA refers, it is undisputed that (1) the legislature conveyed
 
title to the fast and submerged lands within an area that
 
includes the Harbor to HCDA; (2) HCDA was given the mandate to
 redevelop the area that includes the Harbor; and (3) HCDA was
 
12
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
given broad rule-making powers over its projects and properties
 
to implement its mandate. HRS ÿÿÿÿ 206E-33 and 206E-4(5). KOA
 provides no authority for the notion that in order for HCDA to
 have authority over the Harbor, the applicable statutes must
 explicitly name the Harbor or refer to a "commercial harbor," and
 we find none.
 
4. Result
 
The circuit court did not err by failing to find based
 
on the plain language of HRS Chapter 266 that DOT has exclusive 
authority over the Harbor.
B. GENERAL/SPECIFIC
 
KOA contends the circuit court erred in concluding in
 
COL 13 that "the relevant sections of HRS [C]hapter 206E are the
 more specific provisions and the relevant sections of HRS
 
[C]hapter 266 are the more general provisions." KOA argues that
 the reverse is true:
 
[T]he DOT statutes grant DOT the specific authority and a
specific obligation to operate and manage all commercial
harbors, including [the Harbor]. On the other hand, the
HCDA statutes merely convey title to HCDA, along with
general authority to coordinate long-range planning and
development within certain geographic areas, including the
[Kakaako District] (which apparently includes [the Harbor]).
 
(Emphases in original.) KOA contends that Chapter 266 controls.
 
We disagree. Chapter 266 provides DOT with general
 
jurisdiction over all state commercial harbors. HRS ÿÿ 266-1
 
("All commercial harbors . . . shall be under the care and
 control of the [DOT]."). Chapter 206E mandates that HCDA
 redevelop a specific area, Kakaako District, and it is undisputed
 that Kakaako District includes the Harbor. HRS ÿÿÿÿ 206E-31, 206E­32, and 206E-33. The circuit court did not err by concluding
 
that HRS ÿÿ 266-1 was the more general and ÿÿÿÿ 206E-31, 206E-32,
 and 206E-33 the more specific set of statutes. COL 13 is not
 wrong. 
C. COURT'S RELIANCE ON LEGISLATIVE HISTORY OF ACT 272
 1. Plain language of HRS Chapter 266
 
KOA contends the circuit court erred when it
 
disregarded the plain language of HRS Chapter 266 and instead
 
relied upon the legislative history of Act 272 to conclude that
 
13
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
DOT does not have jurisdiction over the Harbor. As we have
 
already discussed, see Part III.A., when juxtaposed with HRS
 Chapter 206E, Chapter 266 does not plainly confer authority over
 the Harbor to DOT.
 
2. No finding of ambiguity
 
KOA maintains the circuit court erred in referring to
 
legislative history when the court did not find that an ambiguity
 existed with regard to Chapters 266 and 206E. We disagree. 
Although the circuit court did not explicitly state that the
 chapters were ambiguous, the court impliedly found that there was
 an irreconcilable conflict between Chapters 266 and 206E with
 regard to whether HCDA or DOT had authority over the Harbor: 
The court has reviewed both sets of provisions in an effort
to try and read them together or to seek clarification of
whether the legislature intended to give HCDA title to the
land underlying [the Habor] but not jurisdiction therefor.
The court cannot so conclude[.] 
The circuit court then implied that because Chapter 206E 
contained the more specific provisions, that chapter should be favored and HCDA had authority over the Harbor. "[W]here there is a 'plainly irreconcilable' conflict between a general and a specific statute concerning the same subject matter, the specific will be favored." Batson , 99 Hawai» i at 120, 53 P.3d at 259 
(quoting Richardson, 76 Hawai» i at 55, 868 P.2d at 1202). 
Given the circuit court's implied finding that there
 
was an irreconcilable conflict between Chapters 266 and 206E, it
 was not improper for the court to consider legislative history in
 attempting to ascertain which set of provisions was more specific
 and, therefore, should be favored. 
[I]mplicit in the task of statutory construction is our
foremost obligation to ascertain and give effect to the
intention of the legislature, which is to be obtained
primarily from the language contained in the statute itself.
. . . [W]hen there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or
indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an expression used in a
statute, an ambiguity exists. . . . [I]n construing an
ambiguous statute, the meaning of the ambiguous words may be
sought by examining the context, with which the ambiguous
words, phrases, and sentences may be compared, in order to
ascertain their true meaning.
 
Unite Here! , 123 Hawai» i at 170-171, 231 P.3d at 443-44 (quoting 
Awakuni, 115 Hawai» i at 133, 165 P.3d at 1034). KOA provides no 
14
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
authority for the notion that the circuit court had to explicitly
 
state that there was an ambiguity, and we find none.
3.	 State Defendants' failure to argue ambiguity
 
KOA also argues that the circuit court should not have 
considered legislative history where the State Defendants did not assert that HRS Chapters 266 and 206E were ambiguous. Regardless of what the State Defendants argued in the State's MSJ, the circuit court was free to grant the State's MSJ based on the record in the case. See Sierra Club, 120 Hawai» i at 197, 202 
P.3d at 1242 (quoting Dennison, 108 Hawai» i at 384, 120 P.3d at 
1119) ("The interpretation of a statute is a question of law which this court reviews de novo.").
4.	 Whether legislative history excludes the
Harbor from "commercial harbors"
 
Alternatively, KOA argues that the circuit court erred
 
in basing its conclusion that DOT does not have authority over
 
the Harbor on legislative history, when the legislative history
 does not suggest that the Harbor is to be excluded from
 "commercial harbors." KOA misconstrues the record. The circuit
 court explicitly stated in COL 11 that "[the Harbor] meets the
 definition of a commercial harbor." The circuit court referred
 to legislative history in its COLs to show that although the
 Harbor is a commercial harbor and DOT has jurisdiction over all
 
commercial harbors pursuant to HRS Chapter 266, the legislature's
 intention was to give HCDA authority over the Harbor.
D.	 HCDA'S PROPOSED RULES
 
KOA contends the circuit court erred in impliedly 
concluding that HRS ÿÿ 206E-4 authorized HCDA to enact rules with regard to the Harbor. KOA argues that HCDA's proposed rules, which would place the Harbor under HCDA's care and control, lack any express statutory basis and would plainly conflict with HRS ÿÿ 266-1, which places the Harbor under DOT's care and control. KOA cites to Haole v. State , 111 Hawai» i 144, 140 P.3d 377 
(2006), to support this argument. Related to this argument is KOA's contention that the following portion of COL 8 is wrong: 
15
  
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"Under HRS ÿÿ 206E-4, the legislature empowered HCDA to 'make
 
rules with respect to its operations and properties.'"
 
In Haole , Haole was an employee of McCabe Hamilton 
Renny & Co., Inc. (McCabe), a company hired by Matson Terminals, Inc. (Matson), a harbor tenant. 111 Hawai» i at 146-47, 140 P.3d 
at 379-80. Haole was injured while riding as a passenger in an automobile being unloaded at the harbor. Id. at 146, 140 P.3d at 379. Haole filed a complaint against Matson and DOT, which owned
 
and managed the harbor, seeking damages for his injuries. Id.
 
DOT brought a cross-claim against Matson and filed a third-party
 complaint against McCabe and Eric Rapoza (Rapoza), the driver of
 the automobile and a McCabe employee. Id.
 
DOT moved for partial summary judgment against Matson, 
McCabe, and Rapoza (the appellants) based on the appellants' 
purported duty to defend the State against Haole's claims, pursuant to Hawai» i Administrative Rules ÿÿ 19-41-7. 111 Hawai » i 
at 147, 140 P.3d at 380. Section 19-41-7 imposed upon "[o]wners . . . [or] operators . . . loading or unloading at state wharves" the duty to indemnify and defend the State against losses, claims, demands and suits for damages resulting from their operations. 111 Hawai» i at 150, 140 P.3d at 383. The appellants 
argued that they had no duty to indemnify and defend the State because DOT's governing statutes did not explicitly authorize DOT 
to issue administrative rules exonerating the State from negligence of its employees or explicitly allow DOT to require private entities to defend and indemnify the State for its employees' negligence. Id. at 151, 140 P.3d at 384. The 
appellants added that 
the legislature's imposition of a statutory duty to defend
and/or indemnify on other occasions demonstrate[d] the
legislature's clear intent to reserve to itself the power to
impose upon others a duty to defend and indemnify the State
and [did] not consider such authority to be implicitly
afforded to State agencies.
 
Id. The State argued that "although the governing statutes [did]
 
not explicitly authorize the DOT to impose a duty to defend or
 
indemnify, the regulation was nevertheless within the DOT's
 
powers to promulgate." Id. The circuit court granted the
 
16
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
State's motion for summary judgment, and the appellants appealed. 
Id. at 149, 140 P.3d at 382. 
On appeal, the Hawai» i Supreme Court stated that a 
public administrative agency possesses only such rule-
making authority as is delegated to it by the state
legislature and may only exercise this power within
the framework of the statute under which it is
 conferred. Administrative rules and regulations which
exceed the scope of the statutory enactment they were
devised to implement are invalid and must be struck
down.
 
Stop H-3 Ass'n v. State [Dep't] of Transp., 68 Haw. 154,
161, 706 P.2d 446, 451 (1985) (internal citations omitted);
see also Puana v. Sunn, 69 Haw. 187, 189, 737 P.2d 867, 870
(1987) (an agency's authority "is limited to enacting rules
which carry out and further the purposes of the legislation
and do not enlarge, alter, or restrict the provisions of the
act being administered"). In other words,
 
an administrative agency can only wield powers
expressly or implicitly granted to it by statute.
However, it is well established that an administrative
agency's authority includes those implied powers that
are reasonably necessary to carry out the powers
 
expressly granted. The reason for implied powers is
that, as a practical matter, the legislature cannot
foresee all the problems incidental to carrying out
the duties and responsibilities of the agency.
 
Morgan [v. Planning Dep't, County of Kaua
»i, 104 Hawai »i 173,
184, 86 P.3d 982, 993 (2004)] (internal quotation marks,brackets, citations, and ellipses omitted) (emphasis added). 
Id. at 152, 140 P.3d at 385 (brackets in original omitted;
 
emphasis added). The court examined the relevant statutes:
 
The relevant governing statutes grant to the DOT all
powers necessary for it to regulate and control the state's
harbors. However, the grant of the DOT's rule-making
authority to carry out its function is specifically defined.
First, the power to define the duties of carriers, shippers,
and consignees under HRS ÿÿ 266-3(a)(5) refers to duties
respecting passengers, freight, goods, wares, and
merchandise in and upon the docks. . . . Nowhere in the
governing statutes is there a specific delegation of power
to the DOT to define the duties owed by such carriers,
shippers, and cosignees to the State as the indemnitee.
Second, although the State argues that the power is that
which is reasonably necessary and without which the DOT
would not be able to fully manage the State harbors, the
State admits and . . . all the parties agree that the DOT
could require by contract what it does here by regulation.
. . . Third, even though HRS ÿÿ 266-3(a)(5) also authorizes
the DOT to enact regulations for the safety of the docks,
there is no evidence -  and the State does not even allege
-that imposing liability for the State's negligence upon
harbor users contributes to increased safety. Finally,
under HRS ÿÿ 266-3(b)(1), the only other general rule-making
provision in that section, the DOT may enact rules necessary
to regulate and control all shipping and all other matters
and things connected with such shipping. Although broad in
scope, the above provision -  like the remaining provisions
 
17
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
of the relevant governing statutes -  does not explicitly
state that the DOT's rule-making authority includes the
power to impose a duty of indemnification. 
Id. at 153, 140 P.3d at 386 (internal quotation marks, citations,
 
and emphases omitted).
 
The supreme court held, inter alia, that DOT's
 
governing statutes did not explicitly or implicitly authorize DOT
 
to issue administrative rules imposing upon private parties "a
 duty to defend or indemnify the State" and the legislature's
 imposition of a statutory duty to defend and/or indemnify in
 other circumstances demonstrated "the legislature's clear intent
 to reserve such power to itself." Id.  at 160, 140 P.3d at 393.
 
Haole is inapplicable to the instant case because here,
 
HCDA possesses rule-making authority delegated to it by the state
 legislature. As we have already discussed, HRS ÿÿ 206E-4(5)
 confers upon HCDA authority to "[m]ake rules with respect to its
 projects" and the Harbor is a "project" pursuant to HRS ÿÿ 206E­2(4). See Part III.A. Under the framework set forth by the
 legislature, HCDA is given the authority to manage the area that
 includes the Harbor. HRS ÿÿÿÿ 206E-31, 206E-32, and 206E-33. This
 authority includes the power to adopt rules to govern the Harbor. 
HRS ÿÿ 206E-4(5). 
The circuit court did not err in impliedly concluding
 
that HRS ÿÿ 206E-4 authorized HCDA to enact rules with regard to
 the Harbor, and COL 8 is not wrong.
E. DOT'S JURISDICTION RESTRICTED BY HRS CHAPTER 206E
 
KOA contends the circuit court erred in concluding that
 
DOT's jurisdiction and powers are subject to restrictions imposed
 
by HRS Chapter 206E, when HRS ÿÿ 266-2(b) provides that DOT shall
 operate and maintain all commercial harbors notwithstanding any
 law to the contrary and no HCDA statute restricts DOT's authority
 to operate and maintain the Harbor. In COL 11, the circuit court
 found that "HRS Chapter 266 makes clear that the powers of the
 [DOT] are subject to limitations imposed by other statutes." HRS
 ÿÿ 266-2(b) provides in relevant part that " [n]otwithstanding any
 
law or provision to the contrary, the [DOT] is authorized to
 
plan, construct, operate, and maintain any commercial harbor
 
18
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
facility in the State." (Emphasis added.) As we have discussed,
 
the circuit court impliedly found that HRS Chapters 266 and 206E
 concern the same subject matter and irreconcilably conflict
 regarding whether HCDA has jurisdiction over the Harbor, and
 Chapter 206E should be favored because it is the more specific
 set of provisions. See Parts III.A. & B. KOA provides no
 authority for its assertion that in order for HCDA to have
 authority over the Harbor, an HCDA statute must specifically
 restrict DOT's authority, and we find none. The circuit court
 did not err by concluding that DOT's jurisdiction and powers are
 subject to restrictions imposed by HRS Chapter 206E, and COL 11
 is not wrong.
F. COURT'S "ABSURD RESULT" FINDING
 
KOA contends the circuit court erred in concluding that 
construing the statutes to grant HCDA jurisdiction over the 
Kakaako District, while maintaining DOT's jurisdiction over the Harbor would lead to an absurd result. In COL 12, the circuit court found that it would be absurd to conclude that "the legislature intended to give HCDA title to the land underlying [the Harbor] but not jurisdiction therefor." "The legislature is presumed not to intend an absurd result, and legislation will be construed to avoid, if possible, inconsistency, contradiction, and illogicality." State v. Arceo , 84 Hawai» i 1, 19, 928 P.2d 
843, 861 (1996) (internal quotation marks, citation, and brackets 
omitted). 
We disagree with KOA and hold that the circuit court's
 
COL 12 is not wrong. As the circuit court stated, the applicable
 statutes and legislative history reveal the legislature's intent
 that HCDA "comprehensively and for the long-term plan, renew, and
 redevelop the Kakaako 'District,' which specifically includes
 [the Harbor]." Implicit in HCDA's task would be the ability to
 implement improvements relating to the Harbor.
G. LAND-BASED JURISDICTION
 
KOA contends that even if the conflict between HRS
 
Chapters 266 and 206E is not irreconcilable and the statutes are
 read in pari materia, HCDA has, at best, land-based jurisdiction
 
19
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
over the Harbor's operations, "including streets, utility
 
systems, housing, parks, and any sewer systems" and "DOT
 maintains operations-based jurisdiction over the Harbor itself
 (including permits and improvements related to commercial harbor
 activity)." KOA cites to a 2001 Opinion Letter by a Deputy
 Attorney General of the State of Hawaii
5 (2001 Letter) to support
 
this argument. In that letter, the Deputy Attorney General
 stated:
 
Here, it does not appear that the Legislature, by
passage of Act 86, intended to repeal, in whole or in part,
DOT's jurisdiction over commercial harbors. The two
 
statutes are not inconsistent with each other and may be
interpreted so that they co-exist. The control and
 
jurisdiction given to HCDA is land based (granted through
expansion of physical boundaries) whereas the control and
jurisdiction given DOT is function based (commercial
harbor). In order for both statutes to coexist and be read
 
consistently, the DOT and HCDA should be viewed as having
overlapping jurisdiction over the Kakaako lands that fall
within a commercial harbor. Given this interpretation, the
DOT may continue to enforce its relevant commercial harbor
rules within the Kakaako lands that fall within a commercial
 
harbor.
 
KOA's reliance on the 2001 Letter is problematic for two reasons. 
First, in the 2001 Letter, the Deputy Attorney General was
 responding to the issue of whether DOT could continue to enforce
 its commercial harbor rules in the Kakaako area. The 2001 Letter
 does not address whether HCDA could adopt its own rules to govern
 the Harbor. The evidence on appeal reveals that DOT now has
 authority over the Harbor, but once HCDA adopts its own
 administrative rules over the Harbor, HCDA may transfer authority
 over the Harbor from DOT to itself. In an August 22, 2007
 Declaration of Teney K. Takahashi (Takahashi),
6 interim executive
 
director of HCDA, Takahashi stated that although DOT planned to
 
turn over management of the Harbor to HCDA, HCDA was not in a
 position take over that responsibility at that time. In an
 August 23, 2007 Declaration of Barry Fukunaga (Fukunaga), DOT's
 Director of Transportation, Fukunaga stated that DOT was at that
 
5
 KOA attached the letter to its memorandum in opposition to the
State's MSJ.
 
6
 The Declaration was attached to the State Defendants' memorandum in
 
opposition to a motion for preliminary injunction filed by KOA.
 
20 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
time responsible for the management of the Harbor and although
 
DOT planned to turn over management of the Harbor to HCDA, DOT
 would not do so until HCDA implemented administrative rules
 regarding the Harbor.
 
Second, the 2001 Letter is dated May 23, 2001, five
 
years before the legislature enacted Act 165, which returned
 jurisdiction and administrative control over Piers 1 and 2 from
 HCDA to DOT. We can infer that if the Deputy Attorney General's
 "land-based" and "operations-based" distinction was correct, the
 legislature would not have felt the need to return jurisdiction
 and administrative control over the piers to DOT. 
KOA cites to no other authority for its contention that 
HCDA has land-based jurisdiction over the Harbor's operations and
 DOT maintains operations-based jurisdiction over the Harbor
 
itself, and we find none. 
H. RESULT
 
The circuit court did not err in granting the State's
 
MSJ because there was no genuine issue of material fact regarding
 whether HCDA had authority over the Harbor, and the State
 Defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
