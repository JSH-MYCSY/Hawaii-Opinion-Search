STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
RICHARD MORRIS, Defendant-Appellant,
and
 
ROBERT BYRCH and ROBERT MICHUTKA, Defendants.
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 06-1-1081)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Richard Morris (Morris) was
 
convicted of two counts of violating the Hawai' i Uniform 
Securities Act (Modified) (hereinafter, "Securities Act"), Hawaii
 
Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 485.1 The Securities Act contains
 
a specific statute of limitations provision that is set forth in
 HRS § 485-21(e) (1993). This provision applies
 "[n]otwithstanding any other laws to the contrary," has a basic
 five-year limitations period which may be extended under
 particular circumstances to a maximum limitations period of seven
 
1
 At the time relevant to this case, the Hawai' i Uniform Securities Act 
(Modified) was codified as HRS Chapter 485. Effective July 1, 2008, HRS
Chapter 485 was repealed and replaced with a new Uniform Securities Actcodified as HRS Chapter 485A. 2006 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 229, §§ 17, 20 at 996.We will cite to HRS Chapter 485, which contains the provisions relevant tothis case.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
years, but does not provide for the tolling of the limitations
 
period while the accused is continually absent from the State. 
HRS § 485-21(e) (1993). 
The Hawai' i Penal Code contains a general statute of 
limitations provision, set forth in HRS § 701-108, that is applicable to all offenses defined by statute. HRS § 701­108(6)(a) (Supp. 1999) provides for the tolling of the limitations period, for up to four years, "[d]uring any time when the accused is continuously absent from the State or has no reasonably ascertainable place of abode or work within the State[.]" 
The dispositive issue in this appeal is whether the two
 
Securities Act counts on which Morris was convicted were charged
 within the applicable statute of limitations. We conclude that: 
(1) the specific statute of limitation provision set forth in HRS
 § 485-21(e) (1993) is the applicable statute of limitations for
 the two Securities Act counts on which Morris was convicted; (2)
 HRS § 485-21(e) does not permit the applicable limitations period
 to be modified and extended by the incorporation of the tolling
 rule set forth in HRS § 701-108(6)(a); and (3) because the HRS 
§ 701-108(6)(a) tolling rule does not apply, the two counts on
 which Morris was convicted were not charged within the applicable
 limitations period. Accordingly, we hold that the Circuit Court
 
2
of the First Circuit (Circuit Court)  erred in denying Morris's
pretrial motion to dismiss those counts for violation of the
 statute of limitations, and we reverse Morris's convictions. 
BACKGROUND
 
I.
 
21st Century Satellite Communications, Inc. (Satellite
 
Communications) was a private cable company based in Florida that
 was established to provide satellite cable TV systems to
 customers. The charges in this case stem from Satellite

 The Honorable Richard K. Perkins presided over the proceedings
relevant to this appeal.
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Communications' attempts to secure funding through the issuance
 
of promissory notes. Robert Byrch (Byrch) was the president of
 Satellite Communications during times relevant to this case. 
Morris was involved as the general broker in selling the
 promissory notes and also became a shareholder of Satellite
 Communications.
 
Robert Michutka (Michutka) was involved in the program
 
to sell promissory notes under Morris, and Michutka, in turn,
 recruited Douglas Nonaka (Nonaka), a Certified Public Accountant
 in Honolulu, to sell the promissory notes. Morris, Michutka, and
 Nonaka received commissions on the sale of the promissory notes,
 with Michutka receiving a commission on the promissory notes sold
 by Nonaka and Morris receiving a commission on the promissory
 notes sold by both Michutka and Nonaka. Between October 1, 1998,
 and September 30, 1999, Nonaka sold over $700,000 worth of
 Satellite Communications promissory notes to his tax clients. 
Satellite Communications did not generate enough 
revenues to pay the interest on the promissory notes. In 2000, Satellite Communications defaulted on the interest payments due on the promissory notes and subsequently filed for bankruptcy in 2001. After Satellite Communications defaulted on its interest payments and filed for bankruptcy, Hawai' i investors contacted 
the Securities Enforcement Branch of the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs (DCCA). The DCCA opened an investigation based on the investors' complaints. 
On October 30, 2001, investigators from the DCCA and
 
the State Attorney General's office interviewed Nonaka, who
 provided information that Morris was the general broker in
 Florida and that Michutka worked under Morris and Nonaka worked
 under Michutka. Nonaka was indicted in November 2003 for
 Securities Act offenses, and he pleaded guilty to numerous
 counts, pursuant to a plea agreement.
 
II.
 
On March 25, 2006, the State charged Morris, Michutka
 
and Byrch by indictment with numerous counts. Morris and
 
3
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Michutka were jointly charged with the sale of unregistered
 
securities (Count II); the sale of securities by an unregistered
 person (Count IV); prohibited securities practices (Count VI);
 securities fraud (Count VIII); and first-degree theft (Count X). 
The counts against Morris and Michutka alleged conduct occurring
 between on or about October 1, 1998, and September 30, 1999. 
Byrch was charged with Securities Act offenses and first-degree
 theft. 
Morris filed a motion for bill of particulars, which
 
was granted as to Counts VI and VIII. With respect to Count VI,
 the State responded that it would prove that the Defendants
 "directly or indirectly made statements to investors that 21st
 Century Satellite Communications, Inc. promissory notes were safe
 and low-risk investments and their moneys were fully secured." 
With respect to Count VIII, the State responded that it would
 prove that the Defendants "directly or indirectly led investors
 to believe that moneys obtained from their promissory notes would
 be used for the purchase and installation of equipment and their
 moneys would be fully secured." 
Prior to trial, Morris filed a motion to dismiss the
 
indictment on the ground that the statute of limitations
 applicable to offenses charged against him had expired before the
 date the indictment was returned. The Circuit Court denied the
 motion and filed a written order of its decision.
 
Byrch pleaded guilty to several Securities Act offenses 
pursuant to a plea agreement, and Morris and Michutka proceeded
 to trial. The jury found Morris guilty of Count VI, prohibited
 securities practices, in violation of HRS § 485-25(a)(2) (1993),
 and guilty of Count VIII, securities fraud, in violation of HRS 
§ 485-25(a)(3) (1993).
3 As to those counts, the jury answered

 HRS §§ 485-25(a)(2) and (a)(3) (1993) provide:
 
§ 485-25 Fraudulent and other prohibited practices.  (a) It
is unlawful for any person, in connection with the offer, sale, or
purchase (whether in a transaction described in section 485-6 or
(continued...)
 
4
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
special interrogatories which classified those offenses as class
 
A felonies.4 The jury acquitted Morris of Counts II, IV, and X,
 
and it acquitted Michutka on all counts.
 
The Circuit Court sentenced Morris to concurrent terms
 
of twenty years of imprisonment on Counts VI and VIII, and it
 entered its Judgment of Conviction and Sentence on May 14, 2008. 
The Circuit Court granted Morris's motion for bail pending
 appeal. In support of this decision, the Circuit Court concluded
 that Morris's appeal of the denial of his motion to dismiss
 indictment for violation of the statute of limitations presents a
 substantial question likely to result in reversal "because the
 issue involves the interpretation of two apparently conflicting

otherwise) of any security (whether or not of a class described in
section 485-4), in the State, directly or indirectly:
 
. . . 
(2)	 To make any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact necessary in order to
make the statements made, in the light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading; [or]
 
(3)	 To engage in any act, practice, or course of business
which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit
upon any person[.]
 
4 HRS § 485-21 (1993) establishes the felony classification of Security
Act offenses based on the total value paid by or lost by the victims, and
provides in relevant part:
 
§ 485-21 Criminal penalties. (a) Whoever violates this
chapter shall be punished as follows:
 
. . . 
(3)	 An offense in which the total value of all money and
anything else of value paid or lost by the victims
pursuant to the same scheme, plan, or representations,
or to the same entity, amounts to $100,000 or more
shall be a class A felony as defined by the Hawaii
Penal Code.
 
. . . .
 
(b) The value of all money and anything else of value paid
or lost by various victims pursuant to the same scheme, plan, or
representations or to the same entity may be aggregated in
determining the class or grade of the offense.

statutes that is not straightforward and could, on appeal, be
 
decided either way." 
DISCUSSION
 
Morris raises numerous points of error on appeal.5 We
 
conclude, however, that the dispositive issue is whether the
 Circuit Court erred in denying Morris's motion to dismiss Counts
 VI and VIII, the counts on which Morris was convicted, for
 violation of the applicable statute of limitations. As explained
 below, we conclude that the statute of limitations on Counts VI
 and VIII expired before the State charged Morris on those counts. 
5 Morris raises the following eleven points of error:
 
1. The Circuit Court erred in denying Morris's motion to dismiss the
indictment for violation of the statute of limitations.
 
2. The Circuit Court erred in denying Morris's motion to dismiss the
indictment for failure of the State to plead the tolling of the statute of
limitations, as required under State v. Stan's Contracting, Inc., 111 Hawai' i 
17, 137 P.3d 331 (2006). 
3. The Circuit Court erred in denying Morris's motion to dismiss the
indictment based on his claim that the State had presented false or misleading
testimony to the grand jury.
 
4. The Circuit Court erred in denying Defendants' motion to dismiss
the indictment for the State's failure to present clearly exculpatory evidence
to the grand jury, for insufficient evidence, and because of prosecutorial
misconduct.
 
5. The Circuit Court erred in denying Morris's motion to dismiss the
indictment for pre-indictment delay.
 
6. The Circuit Court erred when it precluded Morris from cross-
examining Nonaka regarding other investments in which Nonaka was involved.
 
7. The Circuit Court erred when it admitted prejudicial evidence
regarding commissions received by Morris other than from Hawai' i investors. 
8. The Circuit Court erred in instructing the jury on the amount of
loss by special interrogatory instead of as an element of the charged offenses
in Counts VI and VIII. 
9. The Circuit Court erred in instructing the jury on the statute of
limitations tolling provision.
 
10. The Circuit Court erred in failing to give a specific unanimity
instruction.
 
11. The Circuit Court erred in denying Morris's motions for judgment
of acquittal and for a new trial.
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Accordingly, we reverse Morris's convictions.
 
I. 
Our decision on the applicable statute of limitations
 
turns on the interpretation of statutes. Statutory
 
interpretation involves a question of law that is subject to de
 novo 	review. State v. Batson, 99 Hawai' i 118, 119, 53 P.3d 257, 
258 (2002). 
When construing a statute, the starting point is the
language of the statute itself. The court's foremost
 obligation is to ascertain and give effect to the intention
of the legislature, which we discern primarily from the
language of the statute itself, although we may consider
other sources. We must read statutory language in the
context of the entire statute and construe it in a manner
 consistent with its purpose.
 
Id. at 120, 53 P.3d at 259 (internal citations, quotation marks,
 
and brackets omitted). 
The Hawai' i Supreme Court has adopted a three-part 
analysis in interpreting statutes that appear to relate to the
 same subject matter:
 
First, legislative enactments are presumptively valid and
should be interpreted in such a manner as to give them
effect. Second, laws in pari materia, or upon the same
subject matter, shall be construed with reference to each
other. What is clear in one statue may be called in aid to
explain what is doubtful in another. Third, where there is
a plainly irreconcilable conflict between a general and a
specific statute concerning the same subject matter, the
specific will be favored. However, where the statutes
simply overlap in their application, effect will be given to
both if possible, as repeal by implication is disfavored.
 
Id. (internal citations, quotation marks, and brackets omitted). 
II.
 
Morris was convicted of two counts of Securities Act
 
offenses. The statute of limitations provisions potentially
 
applicable to these two counts are set forth below.
 
The Securities Act contains a specific statute of
 
limitations provision, HRS § 485-21(e) (1993), which provides:
 
(e) Notwithstanding any other laws to the contrary,
the following period of limitations will apply to
prosecutions for felony violations of this chapter:
 
(1)	 Prosecution for a felony under this chapter
shall be commenced within five years after the
offense is committed. 
7
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(2)	 If the period prescribed in paragraph (1) has
expired, prosecution for a felony under this
chapter may be commenced within two years after
the discovery of the offense by an aggrieved
party and who is himself not a party to the
offense, but in no event more than seven years
after the offense is committed.
 
(Emphases added.) 
The Hawai' i Penal Code also contains a general statute 
of limitations provision, HRS § 701-108. The version of HRS 
§ 701-108 in effect at the time of this case, HRS § 701-108
 (Supp. 1999), provides, in pertinent part, as follows:
 
§ 701-108 Time limitations. (1) A prosecution for
murder [and murder-related offenses] may be commenced at any
time.
 
(2) Except as otherwise provided in this section,
prosecutions for other offenses are subject to the following
periods of limitation:
 
. . . 
(b)	 A prosecution for a class A felony must be commenced
within six years after it is committed;
 
(c)	 A prosecution for any other felony must be commenced
within three years after it is committed;
 
. . . .
 
(3) If the period prescribed in subsection (2) has
expired, a prosecution may nevertheless be commenced for:
 
(a)	 Any offense an element of which is either fraud
or a breach of fiduciary obligation within three
years after discovery of the offense by an
aggrieved party or by a person who has a legal
duty to represent an aggrieved party and who is
oneself not a party to the offense, but in no
case shall this provision extend the period of
limitation by more than six years from the
expiration of the period of limitation
prescribed in subsection (2); 
. . . .
 
(6)	 The period of limitation does not run:
 
(a)	 During any time when the accused is continuously
absent from the State or has no reasonably
ascertainable place of abode or work within the
State, but in no case shall this provision
extend the period of limitation by more than
four years from the expiration of the period of
limitation prescribed in subsection (2);
 
. . . .
 
8
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(Emphasis added.) The general statute of limitations set forth 
in HRS § 701-108 applies not only to offenses defined under the Hawai'i Penal Code, but also to offenses outside of the Penal 
Code by virtue of HRS § 701-102(3) (1993), which provides that "[t]he provisions of chapters 701 through 706 of the Code are applicable to offenses defined by other statutes, unless the Code otherwise provides."
6 
III. 
The limitations period on Counts VI and VIII against
 
Morris began to run on October 1, 1999, which was the most recent
 date alleged in the indictment with respect to Morris's criminal
 conduct. HRS § 485-21(e)(1) establishes a basic five-year
 limitations period for felony Securities Act offenses. The
 provisions of HRS § 485-21(e)(2), which permit prosecution within
 two years after the discovery of the offense by an aggrieved
 party, did not serve to extend the limitations period beyond the
 basic five-year period in this case. The State and Morris do not 
dispute the Circuit Court's finding that Morris's Securities Act
 offenses were discovered no later than October 30, 2001. 
Five years from October 1, 1999, when the limitations
 
period began to run, is September 30, 2004. The indictment,
 however, was not filed until May 25, 2006. Therefore if the
 statute of limitations is determined pursuant to HRS § 485-21(e),
 the State did not file its charges in Counts VI and VIII against
 Morris until after the statute of limitations had already run.
 
In denying Morris's motion to dismiss the indictment
 
for violation of the statute of limitations, the Circuit Court 
6
 The Commentary to HRS § 701-102 provides, in relevant part:
 
Subsection (3) holds that all of the general provisions
(Chapters 701 to 706) of the Code are applicable to all offenses
defined by other statutes. The purpose is to bring uniformity to
the area of non-Code statutory offenses. One result of this will
 be to make defenses defined by the Code generally available. The
 Code's definition of state of mind requirements will also be
applicable, as will the general principles of construction, time
limitations, and res judicata provisions. 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
found that the tolling provision of HRS § 701-108(6)(a) applied 
to extend the statute of limitations. Morris had acknowledged in his motion that at all times relevant, he had been a resident of Florida and that he had never been to Hawai' i prior to being 
extradited on the indictment. The Circuit Court concluded that this satisfied the requirement for tolling under HRS § 701­108(6)(a) of being "continuously absent from the State." 
The Circuit Court found that HRS § 485-21 "controls the
 
applicable limitation period" for the Securities Act offenses
 charged against Morris. The Circuit Court, however, concluded
 that there was "no conflicting parallel provision" in HRS § 485­21 to the tolling provision in HRS § 701-108(6)(a). The Circuit
 Court ruled that based on its application of the Batson analysis, 
HRS § 701-108(6)(a) was applicable to Morris's Security Act
 offenses and served to save those offenses from being time
 barred.
 
IV.
 
We disagree with the Circuit Court's modification of
 
HRS § 485-21(e) by incorporating the tolling provision set forth
 in HRS § 701-108(6)(a). HRS § 485-21(e) directly applies to
 felony prosecutions of Securities Act offenses and is the more
 specific statute of limitations provision. Therefore, HRS § 485­21(e) is the controlling statute of limitations provision. State
 
v. Kamana' o, 118 Hawai' i 210, 211, 188 P.3d 724, 725 (2008) ("[A] 
specific statute controls over a general statute concerning a common matter[.]"). 
HRS § 485-21(e) begins with the phrase
 
"[n]otwithstanding any other laws to the contrary." When HRS 
7
§ 485-21(e) was enacted with this phrase in 1985,  the tolling
rule set forth in HRS § 701-108(6)(a) was already part of the 
7
 See 1985 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 100, § 4 at 165. The language of HRS
§ 485-21(e) has not changed since its enactment in 1985. 
10
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawai'i Penal Code. See HRS § 701-108(6)(a) (1985).8 We 
conclude that the Legislature's use of this phrase under these 
circumstances demonstrates the Legislature's intent that the provisions of HRS § 485-21(e) would take precedence over other conflicting statute of limitations provisions, including the tolling rule set forth § 701-108(6)(a). 
HRS § 485-21(e) conflicts with several provisions of
 
HRS § 701-108, including HRS § 701-108(6)(a). HRS § 485-21(e)(1)
 provides a basic five-year limitations period for all felony
 Security Act offenses, whereas HRS § 701-108(2) (Supp. 1999)
 provides a basic six-year limitations period for class A felonies
 and a basic three-year limitations period for other felonies. 
HRS § 485-21(e)(2) sets forth a limited exception to the basic
 five-year limitations period by authorizing prosecution "within
 two years after the discovery of the offense by an aggrieved
 party . . . , but in no event more than seven years after the
 offense is committed." (Emphases added.) This conflicts with
 HRS § 701-108(3) (Supp. 1999), which contains a discovery
 exception for offenses involving fraud or breach of fiduciary
 obligation that authorizes prosecution within three years after
 discovery of the offense, but limits the extension of the basic
 limitations period to six years. 
The provisions of HRS § 485-21(e)(2) are especially
 
significant in revealing the Legislature's intent. HRS § 485­21(e)(2) demonstrates that the Legislature intended that any
 extension to the basic five-year limitation period be limited to
 two years, by providing that "in no event" may a prosecution
 commence more than seven years after the offense is committed. 
The maximum seven-year period provided by HRS § 485-21(e)(2)
 conflicts with the tolling rule set forth in HRS § 701-108(6)(a),
 
8
 The 1985 version of HRS § 701-108(6)(a), which was in effect when HRS
§ 485-21(e) was enacted, is basically the same as the "Supp. 1999" version of
HRS § 701-108(6)(a) in effect at the time of this case, except that the 1985
version of HRS § 701-108(6)(a) limited the tolling period to three years
rather than four years.
 
11
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
which would permit a four-year extension of the limitations
 
period and therefore allow a prosecution to commence up to nine
 years after the offense was committed.
9
 
HRS § 485-21(e)(2) also demonstrates that the
 
Legislature considered potential exceptions to the basic five-
year limitations period set forth in HRS § 485-21(e)(1) and only
 chose to create one exception based on the discovery of the
 offense. When HRS § 485-21(e)(2) was enacted, HRS § 701-108
 contained exceptions to its basic limitations periods for both
 (1) the discovery of offenses involving fraud and breach of
 fiduciary obligation (HRS § 701-108(3)(a) (1985)) and (2) tolling
 due to continuous absence from the State (HRS § 701-108(6)(a)
 (1985)). The Legislature's decision to limit the exceptions to
 the basic five-year limitations period for felony Securities Act
 offenses to the discovery exception provides persuasive evidence
 of its intent that the tolling rule set forth in HRS § 701­108(6)(a) would not apply to such offenses. 
Based on this analysis, we conclude that it would be 
inconsistent with the Legislature's intent to modify the specific limitations period for felony Securities Act offenses set forth in HRS § 485-21(e) by incorporating the tolling provision set forth in HRS § 701-108(6)(a). HRS § 485-21(e) and HRS § 701­108(6)(a) do not "simply overlap in their application," but irreconcilably conflict. See Batson, 99 Hawai' i at 120, 53 P.3d 
at 259. Our conclusion is supported by cases from other jurisdictions. See State v. Eilts, 596 P.2d 1050, 1052 (Wash. 
Ct. App. 1979) (declining to apply tolling provision of a general statute of limitations provision to a securities offense with its own statute of limitations provision); State v. Detillio, 629 N.E.2d 1, 1-3 (Ohio Ct. App. 1992) (rejecting prosecution's contention that the "corpus delicti exception" set forth in the 
9
 In other words, the four-year extension on the limitations period
permitted by HRS § 701-108(6)(a) when added to the basic five-year limitations
period for felony Security Act offenses would exceed the maximum seven-year
limitations period provided in HRS § 485-21(e)(2). 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
general statute of limitations provision should be incorporated
 
into the specific statute of limitations provision for securities
 violations); State v. Guthrie, 567 So.2d 544, 545 (Fla. Dist. Ct.
 App. 1990) (concluding that a tolling provision set forth in the
 general statute of limitations law could not be applied to the
 special statute of limitations provision for theft offenses). 
Because the State failed to charge Morris on Counts VI
 
and VIII within the applicable statute of limitations, we reverse
 his convictions on those counts. In light of our decision, we
 need not address the other points of error Morris raises on
 appeal.
 
CONCLUSION
 
We reverse the Circuit Court's Judgment of Conviction
 
and Sentence.
