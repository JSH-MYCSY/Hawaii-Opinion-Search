APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
In these consolidated appeals, Plaintiff-
Appellant/Appellant William Middleton (Middleton), 
pro se,
 
appeals from three separate judgments, entered by the Circuit
 
1
Court of the First Circuit (circuit court),  upholding
administrative decisions by Defendant-Appellee/Appellee State of
 
Hawai'i, Department of Human Services (DHS). 
Both Middleton's appeals are related to DHS's decision
 
to terminate his medical assistance and food stamp benefits. In
 
Appeal No. 29164, Middleton appeals the circuit court's judgment
 
1
 The Honorable Eden Elizabeth Hifo presided in both cases.
 upholding a DHS hearing officer's determination that DHS properly
 
terminated Middleton's food stamp benefits upon discovering he
 
was ineligible due to unreported assets.
 
Appeal No. 30618 involves two separate actions filed by
 
Middleton with the circuit court. In the first action, Civil No.
 
08-1-1728, Middleton challenged DHS's efforts to seek repayment
 
from Middleton for the value of the food stamps he received while
 
ineligible. In the second action, Civil No. 09-1-1540, Middleton
 
challenged DHS's determination that Middleton was disqualified
 
from applying for food stamps for one year as a result of his
 
failure to disclose the assets that rendered him ineligible. 
We must first note that Middleton's briefs are in 
wholesale nonconformity with the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b) and are extremely difficult to follow. On this basis alone, we could dismiss his appeal. HRAP 
Rule 30 (2001) ("When the brief of an appellant is . . . not in 
conformity with these rules, the appeal may be dismissed or the 
brief stricken and monetary or other sanctions may be levied by 
the appellate court."). See also Schefke v. Reliable Collection 
Agency, Ltd., 96 Hawai' i 408, 420, 32 P.3d 52, 64 (2001); 
Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai' i 225, 228, 909 P.2d 553, 
556 (1995) ("appellant's brief in almost no respect conforms to the requirements of [HRAP] Rule 28(b), which we have held is, 
alone, sufficient basis to affirm the judgment of the circuit 
court") (citation omitted). 
However, we also recognize that our appellate courts 
have "consistently adhered to the policy of affording litigants 
the opportunity to have their cases heard on the merits, where 
possible," Schefke, 96 Hawai' i at 420, 32 P.3d at 64 (internal 
quotation marks and citation omitted; emphasis supplied), and have addressed the merits of an appeal, the nonconformance of the 
appellate briefs notwithstanding. See, e.g., O'Connor v. Diocese 
of Honolulu, 77 Hawai' i 383, 385-86, 885 P.2d 361, 363-64 (1994). 
We surmise that the foregoing policy is most acute where, as 
2
 here, the litigant is pro se. Thus, we address Middleton's
 
arguments insofar as they can be gleaned from his briefs.
 
We begin by acknowledging that our review of an appeal 
from an agency decision is de novo. That is to say, we decide "whether the court under review was right or wrong in its 
decision." Soderlund v. Admin. Dir. of the Courts, 96 Hawai' i 
114, 118, 26 P.3d 1214, 1218 (2001) (quoting Farmer v. Admin. Dir. of the Court, 94 Hawai' i 232, 236, 11 P.3d 457, 461 (2000)) 
(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). However, that is not to say that, as Middleton apparently argues the circuit 
court should have, we are under any obligation to scour the 
record and make Middleton's arguments for him. With these 
concepts in mind, we consider Middleton's appeals. 
In Appeal No. 29164, it appears Middleton claims that
 
DHS improperly counted his assets--an "Ameriprise account" that
 
he had possessed at the time of his application for benefits but
 
did not disclose in the application--in determining his
 
eligibility for food stamps and medical assistance.
2 In
 
particular, he argues that his assets are proceeds from a pension
 plan and thus should be excluded as assets with respect to the
 
food stamp program pursuant to Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR)
 
§ 17-675-29 (amended 1994). That section states, inter alia,
 
that assets excluded from the food stamp program include "cash
 
value of life insurance policies" and "cash value of pension
 
plans or funds, except for . . . individual retirement accounts
 
(IRA's)[.]" HAR § 17-675-29(3) and (4). The DHS hearing officer
 
rejected this argument, and the record reveals that the
 
Ameriprise account in question is designated as a rollover IRA. 
We agree with the DHS hearing officer's rejection of Middleton's
 
argument. Middleton does not offer any other cogent argument that
 
convinces this

 DHS discovered this Ameriprise account when it reviewed a report
provided by the Internal Revenue Service, reflecting Middleton had an
Individual Retirement Account (IRA) valued at $22,308.24.
 
3
 court that the circuit court erred in upholding DHS's
 
determination that Middleton was not eligible for food stamps or
 
medical assistance.
 
In Appeal No. 30618, Civil No. 08-1-1728, Middleton
 
contends that the circuit court erred in upholding DHS's
 
determination that Middleton was required to repay the value of
 
the food stamps he received while ineligible. In support of this
 
contention, Middleton apparently maintains that DHS's overpayment
 
claims are invalid because of a number of procedural issues.
 
1. Middleton contends that DHS did not assist him in 
completing the application form for the food stamp program. This 
is an issue that Middleton did not raise before the circuit 
court. New issues on appeal are generally deemed waived. See 
Kemp v. State of Hawai' i Child Support Enforcement Agency, 111 
Hawai'i 367, 391, 141 P.3d 1014, 1038 (2006). Even were we to 
consider Middleton's argument on this issue, it is without merit. While HAR § 17-647-3 provides for DHS assistance with completing 
an application, it does not mean that the department is 
responsible for material omissions by the applicant. Middleton 
signed the application under penalty of law that his answers were 
correct and complete to the best of his knowledge and that he 
understood the questions and the record reflects he was informed 
of his rights and responsibilities with regard to the 
application. 
2. Middleton also seems to argue that there was a due
 
process violation because there was no "'Full Disclosure' with
 
'Adequate Notice' (sic) by DHS." At another point, he contends
 
that he did not receive all required documents from DHS. 
However, Middleton does not adequately explain--either factually
 
or legally--how his due process rights were violated. Nothing in
 
the record indicates that Middleton did not receive relevant
 
documentation from DHS. Notably, DHS sent Middleton 201 pages of
 
documents relevant to his case on March 16, 2009.
 
4
 3. The record does not corroborate Middleton's
 
allegations, nor does he provide adequate supporting legal
 
authority, that the hearings process was conducted illegally,
 
that the hearings officer did not rule on several documents he
 
submitted, that he was not provided with copies of documents
 
submitted at the hearing, and that he was not permitted to
 
present evidence or argument regarding DHS's overpayment of food
 
stamps and subsequent adjustments.
 
4. Middleton appears to argue, but does not provide
 
legal authority for his position, that the overpayment notices
 
sent by DHS, which originally indicated the overpayment was the
 
result of "client error" (as opposed to an intentional
 
violation), prevented DHS from later determining there was an
 
intentional program violation. As DHS must identify and
 
investigate suspected fraud before classifying an overpayment as
 
an intentional program violation, see HAR § 17-604.1-3, there is
 
no authority suggesting DHS cannot indicate "client error" on the
 
notice of food stamp overpayment before a finding of an
 
intentional violation is made.
 
5. Middleton's argument that the circuit court erred
 
in setting a briefing schedule for oral argument is without
 
merit. See Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 603-21.9 (1993)
 
(granting circuit courts the power "to make and issue all orders
 and writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their original or
 
appellate jurisdiction").
 
6. Middleton also argues that the circuit court erred
 
in denying his request for alternative dispute resolution,
 
referencing HRS § 91-14. Middleton points to nothing that
 
supports the notion that the circuit court was required to grant
 
such a motion.
 
7. Finally, Middleton seems to argue that he was
 
entitled to a jury trial and the circuit court erred in denying
 
this request. HRS § 91-14(f) (1993) states that judicial review
 
of a hearing "shall be conducted by the appropriate court without
 
5
 a jury and shall be confined to the record[.]" The only
 
exception is when a jury trial is required by law. Middleton
 
presents no authority, nor do we know of any, suggesting that a
 
jury trial is required in an appeal of an administrative agency
 
decision under the circumstances of this case.
 
In Appeal No. 30618, Civil No. 09-1-1540, Middleton
 
contends that the circuit court erred in upholding DHS's
 
determination that Middleton should be disqualified from
 
receiving food stamps for twelve months due to his intentional
 
failure to disclose an asset. A hearing was held on May 15,
 
2009, to determine whether Middleton committed an intentional
 
3
program violation  when he failed to report his Ameriprise
account. The hearings officer determined that Middleton had
 
committed an intentional program violation, rendering him
 
ineligible to participate in the food stamp program for one year
 
pursuant to HAR § 17-604.1-9. Middleton does not appear to
 
dispute this finding. The record indicates that there was clear
 
evidence that Middleton intentionally failed to report his
 
Ameriprise account when he applied for food stamps. Middleton
 
claimed that he believed the asset was exempt because it was a
 
life insurance policy. However, the application requires
 
reporting of life insurance policies as well as annuities. We
 
find no basis to conclude DHS erred in its determination that
 
Middleton intentionally concealed information regarding his
 
assets in his food stamps application.
 
Therefore, the Circuit Court of the First Circuit's
 
April 21, 2008 Judgment entered in Civil No. 07-1-0479-03, the
 
3
 HAR § l7-604.1-2 defines an intentional program violation, in
relevant part, as: 
[A]ny action by an individual, for the purpose of
establishing or maintaining eligibility or for increasing or
preventing a reduction in benefits, who intentionally:
 
(1) Made a false or misleading statement; [or]
 
(2) Misrepresented, concealed, or withheld facts[.]

June 17, 2010 Judgment entered in Civil No. 09-1540-07 are hereby
 
affirmed.
