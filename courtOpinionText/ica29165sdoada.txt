SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Plaintiffs-Appellants David Garner, Allan Kliternick, 
Jo Jennifer Goldsmith and David Hudson, on behalf of themselves 
and all others similarly situated (Appellants or Substitute 
Teachers), appeal from the Order Denying Plaintiffs' Motion for 
Reconsideration and Relief from Final Judgment filed on May 5, 
2008, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court).1 
Final Judgment (Judgment) in favor of Defendant-Appellee State of 
Hawai'i, Department of Education (State or DOE) was previously 
entered on October 26, 2007. The Judgment was affirmed by this 
court, in No. 28857, on January 21, 2011. The Substitute 
1
 The Honorable Victoria S. Marks presided.

Teachers' subsequent application for a writ of certiorari was
 
denied, in No. SCWC-28857, on August 3, 2011.
 
In this appeal, Appellants contend that:
 
The Circuit Court erred in denying Appellants' Motion for
Reconsideration and Relief from Final Judgment because (A)
relief from the Final Judgment should have been awarded
pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b)(3) due to the DOE's
misrepresentation and fraud on the Circuit Court and (B)
relief from the Final Judgment should have been awarded
pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) due to the important public
interest and the lack of prejudice to the DOE[.]
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve the Substitute Teachers' contention as follows:
 
We reject Appellants' argument that the Circuit Court 
abused its discretion when it denied their motion for 
reconsideration and relief. At the hearing on Appellant's 
motion, the Circuit Court specifically stated that an alleged 
misrepresentation to the court regarding appropriations "had no 
bearing on [the court's] decision-making" and that the issue 
before the court was primarily a matter of statutory 
interpretation. As set forth in this court's January 21, 2011 
summary disposition order in No. 28857, under the plain and 
unambiguous language of Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 302A-624 (Supp. 
2006), as amended by Act 263 of 2006 (see 2006 Haw. Sess. L. 
263), the Circuit Court correctly entered judgment, as a matter 
of law, in favor of the State and against the Substitute Teachers 
on the merits of this case. As the Circuit Court did not base 
its denial of the Substitute Teachers' motion for reconsideration 
and relief on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly 
erroneous assessment of the facts, we cannot conclude that the 
Circuit Court "clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or 
disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the 
substantial detriment of a party litigant." Beneficial Hawai' i,

(citation omitted) (discussing standard of review applicable to
 
the review of a motion made pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Civil 
Procedure Rule 60(b)). 
Accordingly, we affirm the Circuit Court's May 5, 2008
 
Order Denying Plaintiffs' Motion for Reconsideration and Relief
 from Final Judgment.
