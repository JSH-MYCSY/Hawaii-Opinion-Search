OPINION OF THE COURT BY LEONARD, J.
 
Petitioner-Appellant Frances Kailieha (Kailieha)

Judgment, which was entered in favor of Respondents-Appellees

(the Wong Appellees) and against Kailieha on July 9, 2008.  On
 
appeal, Kailieha contends that the Probate Court erred in
 entering judgment in favor of the Wong Appellees by concluding
 that Kailieha "has not presented genuine issues of material fact
 as to her standing" to contest the validity of her mother's 1996
 trust and will. We agree. Under the facts presented in this

  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
case, we hold that Kailieha has alleged a sufficient interest in
 
her mother's estate, as an heir-at-law, to establish her standing
 to challenge the subject instruments, notwithstanding the
 existence of a prior will that, although facially valid, has not
 and may not ever be submitted to probate.
 I. BACKGROUND FACTS
 
Jack Wong Yuen (Jack) and Lei Young Wong Yuen (Lei)
 
(collectively "Settlors") signed an indenture of trust, dated
 
April 22, 1996, entitled the "Revocable Living Trust of Jack Wong
 
Yuen and Lei Young Wong Yuen" (Joint Trust). On September 16,
 
1996, Lei signed a Will (1996 Will) purporting to be her last
 
will and testament that, among other things, transferred the
 
"residue and remainder" of her probate estate into the Joint
 Trust. On May 30, 2003, the Joint Trust was amended to add Lei's
 daughter Moira Bright (Bright), as a co-trustee with James Wong,
 
Jr., who was Jack's nephew. Jack died on September 20, 2004. 
Lei died nearly a year later, on July 19, 2005.
 
Jack and Lei were survived, amongst others, by
 
daughters, Esther Nichols, Rowena Adviento, Kailieha, and 
2
Bright, grandsons, Shane Ah Chock Campbell (Campbell)  and
Bernard Kailieha, and Jack's brother, James Wong, Sr. 
The Wong Appellees (Jarrett, Jace, Jamie and Jacelyn)
 
are the children of James Wong, Jr. - Jack's nephew, and the
 
grandchildren of James Wong, Sr. James Wong, Jr. predeceased
 Lei.
 
Under terms of the 1996 Will, all of Lei's real
 
property holdings and her residual estate were transferred into
 the Joint Trust upon her death, with her tangible personal
 property being bequeathed to her daughters (if Jack predeceased
 her). Under the terms of the Joint Trust, upon the deaths of 
Jack and Lei, the personal property of the trust was to be
 distributed free from any trust in equal shares to the "brothers
 and nephew" of Jack and the "daughters and grandsons" of Lei. 
2
 Although Campbell is Jack and Lei's grandchild, both Jack and
Lei's obituaries refer to him as their "hanai son."
 
2
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The real property held by the trust, however, was to remain in
 
trust and to be conveyed to James Wong, Jr., as trustee, for the
 benefit of "the brothers and nephew of Jack." The Joint Trust
 further provided:
 
If any of the above named beneficiaries [Jack's brothers and
nephew] should predecease the last survivor of us [the
settlors], or if any of them should die during the term of
the trust herein established, his interest shall terminate
and the survivors of them shall be the trust beneficiaries.
 
In addition, the Joint Trust stated that the real
 
property trust created for the benefit of Jack's "brothers and
 
nephew" would terminate 
when all of the real property is sold and the net proceeds
distributed, or upon the death of the last surviving brother
of Jack Wong Yuen. In such an event, the real property
shall be conveyed, free of trust, unto my nephew, James
Wong, Jr. or, if deceased, then unto his surviving children
in equal shares.
 
James Wong, Sr. was the sole surviving brother of Jack.
 
As James Wong, Jr. was deceased, the corpus of the real property
 
trust was to be conveyed to his surviving children, the Wong
 Appellees, upon the death of James Wong, Sr. However, James
 Wong, Sr. disclaimed his interest in the Joint Trust on February
 14, 2006. 
Prior to the execution of her 1996 Will and the Joint
 
Trust, Lei executed a will on November 10, 1975 (1975 Will),
 
which bequeathed everything to Jack; but if Jack predeceased Lei,
 
everything was left to Campbell, subject to a life estate in
 favor of Walter Wong Yuen, one of Jack's brothers, who did not
 survive Jack and Lei. 
In the proceeding below, both Kailieha and Campbell
 
submitted sworn declarations stating that they had entered into
 an agreement in which Campbell promised Kailieha that, if she
 prosecuted her petition to challenge the 1996 Will and Joint
 Trust to a successful conclusion, and if the 1975 Will were ever
 offered into probate and proven valid, he would share with
 Kailieha Lei's estate devised to Campbell under the 1975 Will. 
3
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The 1975 Will has never been submitted for approval in a probate
 
proceeding.
 
On October 20, 2006, the Wong Appellees petitioned the
 
probate court to, among other things, compel an accounting and
 distribution of the assets of the Joint Trust. In an objection
 to the Wong Petition, Kailieha alleged that Lei "suffered from
 Alzheimer dementia since as early as 1988 and that she did not
 possess the legal capacity to create the subject trust, to fund
 it or to otherwise convey an interest in property which the
 Petition assumes is properly a part of its corpus." In addition,
 while the Wong Petition was pending, Kailieha filed a petition
 challenging the validity of the Joint Trust and the 1996 Will,
 alleging that her mother Lei lacked the mental capacity to
 execute the Joint Trust and 1996 Will, and asserting that the
 Joint Trust and 1996 Will were the products of undue influence. 
On November 30, 2007, the Wong Appellees filed a motion
 
for summary judgment, asserting that Kailieha did not have
 standing to challenge the 1996 Will and Joint Trust. The Probate
 Court granted the Wong Appellees' motion based on the following
 reasons, which were incorporated into the court's order:
 
HRS § 560:7-201(a) (2006) states that the 'court has
jurisdiction of proceedings and interested persons
concerning the internal affairs of trusts.' The definition of 'interested person' is found in HRS § 560:7-201(a)(2006). The Hawai' i Supreme Court views the definition to
include only those persons who have a financial interest in
the estate itself. In re Damon Estate, 109 Hawai' i 502, 512
(2006). 
If the Trust and 1996 Will are invalid and if the 1975
 
Will is valid, the[n] Kailieha has no direct financial
interest in the Estate. Therefore, she would not have
standing to contest the Trust and the 1996 Will.
 
At this juncture, the question is which party or
parties have what burden with respect to the issue of the
1975 Will and whether the burden has been met. The Deposit
of Original Will relating to the 1975 Will is proof of the
existence of the 1975 Will.
 
The 1975 Will meets the requirements of HRS § 560:2­
504 (2006) for being self-proved. [] HRS § 560:3-406(b)
(2006) states that:
 
4
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
[i]f the will is self-proved, compliance with
the signature requirements for execution is
conclusively presumed and other requirements of
execution are presumed subject to rebuttal without the
testimony of any witness upon filing the will and the
acknowledgment and affidavits annexed or attached
thereto, unless there is proof of fraud or forgery
affecting the acknowledgment or affidavit.
 
HRS § 560:3-406(b) (2006).
 
Under HRS § 560:3-407 (2006), '[p]roponents of a will
have the burden of establishing prima facie proof of due
execution in all cases, and, if they are also petitioners,
prima facie proof of death and venue.' Therefore, Movants
have met their burden of producing evidence indicating that
the 1975 Will is valid. As such, to escape summary
judgment, Kailieha now has the burden showing that, based
upon admissible facts, that there are genuine issues of fact
as to the validity of the 1975 [Will]. She has not done so.
 
To the extent that Kailieha argues that she has a
financial interest in the Estate because she has an
 agreement with a beneficiary under the 1975 Will, that may
constitute a contract between the two, but that does not
mean that Kailieha has a financial interest in the Estate.
 
Therefore, summary judgment is granted in favor of
Movants and against Kailieha on the ground that Kailieha has
not presented genuine issues of material fact as to her
standing to present the claim in this action.
3
 
Kailieha filed a petition for reconsideration, which
 
was denied on April 8, 2008. Thereafter, the Probate Court
 
ordered the distribution of the assets of the Joint Trust to the
 Wong Appellees. Kailieha filed a notice of appeal on May 19,
 2008, prior to the Probate Court's entry of the Final Judgment. 
Nevertheless, for the reasons set forth in this court's November
 18, 2008 order denying the Wong Appellees' motion to dismiss this
 appeal, we conclude that this court has appellate jurisdiction.
 II. POINTS OF ERROR
 
Kailieha raises two points of error on appeal,
 
contending that the Probate Court erred by: (1) granting
 summary judgment against Kailieha on the grounds that she lacked
 standing to challenge her mother's 1996 Will and the Joint Trust;
 
3
 Misspellings of "Kailieha" have been corrected.
 
5
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and (2) denying Kailieha's motion to reconsider the entry of
 
summary judgment against her.
 III. APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
The appellate court reviews a lower court's grant or 
denial of summary judgment de novo. "Under the de novo standard, [the appellate court is to] examine the facts and answer the question without being required to give any weight to the circuit court's answer to it." Hawaii Ventures, LLC, v. Otaka, Inc., 114 
Hawai'i 438, 457, 164 P.3d 696, 715 (2007) (citations, internal 
quotation marks, and brackets omitted). Moreover, 
[a] grant of summary judgment is appropriate where there is
no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving
party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In other
 words, summary judgment should not be granted unless the
entire record shows a right to judgment with such clarity as
to leave no room for controversy and establishes
affirmatively that the adverse party cannot prevail under
any circumstances. A fact is material if proof of that fact
would have the effect of establishing or refuting one of the
essential elements of a cause of action or defense asserted
 by the parties.
 
Balthazar v. Verizon Hawaii, Inc., 109 Hawai' i 69, 72, 123 P.3d 
194, 197 (2005) (footnote, citations, and internal quotation 
marks omitted). Additionally, "[the appellate court] must view all of the evidence and the inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion." Kahale 
v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 104 Hawai' i 341, 344, 90 P.3d 233, 
236 (2004) (citation omitted). 
The issue of standing is reviewed de novo on appeal. 
See, e.g, Right to Know Comm. v. City Council, City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 117 Hawai' i 1, 7, 175 P.3d 111, 117 (App. 2007).

reconsideration is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard. Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea

IV. DISCUSSION
 
A. Summary Judgment on the Issue of Standing
 Kailieha argues that the Probate Court erred in 
determining that she lacked standing to challenge the 1996 Will and the Joint Trust. Kailieha maintains that she has a sufficient financial interest in her mother's estate because any part of Lei's estate that passes intestate would pass to Lei's children, including Kailieha. In addition, Kailieha maintains that she has a financial interest in Lei's estate as the assignee of a portion of Campbell's interest in Lei's estate, if any, that would arise if the 1975 Will were to be probated. The Wong Appellees contend, as the Probate Court concluded, that Kailieha lacks standing because she did not demonstrate that she would benefit financially if her challenge to the 1996 Will and Joint Trust were successful, relying primarily on In re Damon Estate, 109 Hawai' i 502, 128 P.3d 815 (2006) (Damon Estate). We conclude 
that the Probate Court's reading of Damon Estate was too broad and that Kailieha has standing in this case. 
"The [probate] court has jurisdiction of proceedings
 
initiated by trustees and interested persons concerning the
 internal affairs of trusts." Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 
§ 560:7-201(a) (2006) (emphasis added). "Interested persons"
 
includes:
 
heirs, devisees, children, spouses or reciprocal
beneficiaries, creditors, beneficiaries, and any others
having a property right in or claim against a trust estate
or the estate of a decedent, ward, or protected person
. . . . The meaning as it relates to particular persons may
vary from time to time and must be determined according to
the particular purposes of, and matter involved in, any
proceeding.
 
HRS § 560:1-201 (2006).
 
In Damon Estate, the Hawai' i Supreme Court noted that 
the definition of interested persons "allows the court to 
determine the sufficiency of a party's interest relative to the particular probate proceeding," and that "[a]n interested person, however, will always possess an interest in the estate itself."

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
109 Hawai' i at 511-12, 128 P.3d at 824-25. In so finding, the 
Damon Estate court held that Joan Haig, an income beneficiary and 
measuring life of the trust created under the last will and testament of Samuel Mills Damon, did not have any interest in Damon's estate that would be affected by the subject proceeding, which was a determination of the stirpital root for the distribution of the corpus of the trust upon its termination, i.e., after Joan Haig's death. Id. at 512, 128 P.3d at 825. As 
such, Joan Haig's interest in that particular proceeding was insufficient for her to be considered an "interested person." Id. 
Damon Estate was not intended to create an unreasonably
 
restrictive standard of standing for heirs-at-law who might or
 might not ultimately benefit from a proceeding to contest a will. 
In the proceeding at issue in Damon Estate, there was absolutely
 no set of facts under which Joan Haig would have a property right
 in or claim against the corpus of the Damon trust. Here,
 however, an heir-at-law who successfully challenges a
 testamentary instrument has the possibility of taking via
 intestacy, depending on the outcome of this proceeding and
 further proceedings. See HRS §§ 560:2-101(a)(2006), 560:2-103(1)
 
(2006) and 560:2-106 (2006) (establishing that an intestate
 decedent's estate passes, in the first instance, to the
 decedent's descendants by representation, beginning with the
 decedent's child(ren)). As discussed below, the Wong Appellees
 argue that the Circuit Court correctly concluded that Kailieha
 would not receive any benefit under the 1975 Will. As Kailieha
 points out, however, the 1975 Will has not been submitted to
 probate and there is no certainty that it will ever be submitted,
 nor do the Wong Appellees allege this to be the case. Unlike
 Joan Haig, Kailieha seeks to establish a property right in or
 claim against Lei's estate and a challenge to the 1996 Will and
 Joint Trust is a necessary step in pursuing such a claim. 
Accordingly, Kailieha has a claimed interest in Lei's estate
 
8
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
sufficient to give her standing to contest the Joint Trust and
 
1996 Will, contingent on the successful invalidation of Lei's
 1996 Will and the Joint Trust, and further proceedings. 
The Wong Appellees urge this court to determine that
 
Kailieha has no standing in this proceeding because she takes
 nothing under the 1975 Will, which effectively bequeaths Lei's
 entire estate to Campbell. The Wong Appellees argue that
 although the 1975 Will has not yet been submitted to probate, it
 satisfies all of the statutory requirements for a facially valid
 will under HRS § 560:2-502.
4  Therefore, the Wong Appellees
 
contend that this Court must take the 1975 Will into
 consideration in determining whether Kailieha has standing to
 contest the Joint Trust and 1996 Will. The Wong Appellees cite
 various cases from other jurisdictions for the proposition that
 individuals who were disinherited by a prior testamentary
 instrument do not have standing to challenge a subsequent
 instrument because they lack the requisite financial interest in
 the estate.
5 The Hawai' i Supreme Court, however, has generally 
4
 The Wong Appellees point to the 1975 Will itself in order to
demonstrate that it complied with the three statutory requirements for being a
facially valid will. HRS § 560:2-502 provides that in order to be a facially
valid will, a will must be (1) in writing, (2) signed by the testator, and (3)
signed by at least two individuals who indicated that the testator signed the
will in their presence. HRS § 560:2-502 (2006). The Probate Court also found
 that the 1975 Will was "self-proved." Under HRS § 560:2-504, a self-proved
will is evidence that the will is validly executed and attested to. While a
 
self-proving will is evidence that the will is properly executed, "to be
effective to prove the transfer of any property or to nominate an executor, a
will must be declared to be valid by an order of informal probate by the
registrar, or an adjudication of probate by the court." HRS § 560:3-102
(2006). As such, the fact that the 1975 Will is self-proving is not evidence,
in and of itself, that the 1975 Will is determinative, absent some affirmative
act to submit the will to probate. Generally, a probate proceeding "may be
commenced by an interested person," see HRS § 560:3-401 (2006) (for formal
probate proceedings), or a parent, spouse, descendant of a parent of the
decedent for informal probate proceedings pursuant to HRS § 560:3-302. There
 is nothing in the record to indicate that the 1975 Will will be submitted to
probate, nor do the parties allege this to be the case.

 Anderson, 70 Haw. 276, 281, 768 P.2d 1293, 1298 (1989)) (emphasis
 added) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). The Wong
 Appellees' argument focuses on not only the merits of Kailieha's
 allegations that she has a financial interest in Lei's estate,
 but the ramifications of a successful contest in order to bar
 Kailieha's challenge to the Joint Trust and 1996 Will, the merits
 of a probate proceeding that has not been initiated, and the
 merits of Kailieha's assertion that she is an assignee of a
 portion of Campbell's interest under the 1975 Will.

 Although no cases have arisen in modern times, the Hawai' i Supreme
Court has noted that "[n]o question is made as to the right of an heir to
assign his possibility of inheritance."  Estate of Bernice Pauahi Bishop, 5 
Haw. 288, 290 (1885). In addition, HRS Chapter 560 defines a "beneficiary"as including "the owner of an interest by assignment or other transfer." HRS § 560:1-201 (2006). In general, "an assignment operates to place the assigneein the shoes of the assignor, and provides the assignee with the same legalrights as the assignor had before assignment." Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. V. AIG 
Haw. Ins. Co., 109 Hawai' i 343, 349, 126 P.3d 386, 392 (2006) (citation
omitted). Courts have generally recognized that assignees or grantees of anheir's right to contest, or of his property rights in the decedent's estate,are generally entitled to contest a will of the decedent which the heir wouldhave been entitled to contest. See In re Estate of Clark, 271 P. 542, 545-46
(Cal. Ct. App. 1928) (finding that the right of action to contest a will isassignable because "a contest of a will is in its essence an action for therecovery of property unlawfully taken or about to be taken from the ownershipof the contestant . . . [and an] action arising out of the violation of aright of property . . . may be transferred by the owner."); Trevino v.Turcotte, 564 S.W.2d 682, 687 (Tex. 1978) (noting that it is an establishedrule "that the heirs, devisees and legatees of a decedent may validly assignall or any part of their interests in a decedent's estate," which enables themto contest a will's validity); see also 39 A.L.R.3d 696 § 3(a). A majority of
states hold that the right to contest a will is a property right that isassignable. Yingling v. Smith, 255 A.2d 64, 66 (Md. 1969) (identifying
numerous states that adopt this view).

inherit via intestacy, despite any prior unprobated wills. In In
 
re Estate of Schlenker, the Illinois appellate court held that:
 
a disinherited heir at law stands to inherit a portion of a
decedent's estate if it should be determined that the estate
 is to be distributed under the laws of intestacy, and a
disinherited heir at law has an existing interest that would
be detrimentally affected by the probate of a decedent's
will.
 
789 N.E.2d 456, 458 (Ill. App. Dist., 2003). In Schlenker, the
 
petitioner (the testator's child) filed a petition challenging
 the validity of a 2001 will on the grounds that the testator had
 been impaired by a variety of physical and mental conditions and
 had lacked the mental capacity required to make decisions
 regarding the disposition of his estate and property. Id. at
 
457. 
The executor alleged that the petitioner did not have
 
standing to challenge the will because the petitioner was not a
 legatee and would not stand to benefit under three prior wills,
 which she had not challenged. Id. at 458. In Schlenker, the
 
2001 will was the only will that had been admitted to probate;
 however, the Petitioner indicated that she intended to challenge
 each of the prior wills if subsequently submitted to probate. 
Id. The court recognized that the prior wills might be submitted
 for probate should the 2001 will be declared invalid, but stated:
 
We do not find that [the petitioner's] interest is remote or
otherwise nonexistent merely because she may be required to
contest the 2001 will and three prior wills before she is
entitled to succeed to the testator's estate. In terms of
 the right to take by intestacy, each time a disinherited
heir successfully challenges the validity of a will, that
heir is thereby benefitted. Until all will contests are
 decided, it cannot be said that [petitioner] is not an
interested party.
 
Id. at 458-59.7 As such, that court held that the trial court

 The Illinois statutory definition of "interested person" is
different, but similar, to Hawai' i's statutory definition. The Illinois 
statute provides that an "interested person" means
 
one who has or represents a financial interest, property right or
fiduciary status at the time of reference which may be affected by
the action, power or proceeding involved, including without
limitation an heir, legatee, creditor, person entitled to a
spouse's or child's award and the representative. 
11
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
erred in finding that the petitioner did not have standing to
 
contest the will. Id. at 459. 
Similarly, a widely cited Kansas Supreme Court case
 
noted
 
[there are] cases which apparently hold that an heir who was
disinherited by an earlier valid, unprobated will cannot
 
maintain an action to contest a later will or codicil. How
 
an unprobated will could be said to be a valid will and used
 
in litigation as a valid will to the prejudice of an heir
who has never had a chance to question its validity calls
for a subtlety of reasoning which we would not care to
follow.
 
Marr v. Barnes, 267 P. 9 (Kan. 1928) (emphasis in original)
 
(cited and adopted by Lonas v. Betts, 160 F.2d 281 (D.C. Cir.
 1947)); Stephens v. Brady, 73 S.E.2d 182 (Ga. 1952); In re Estate
 of Powers, 106 N.W.2d 833 (Mich. 1961) ("An instrument submitted
 as a final testament enjoys no legal, distinguished from
 evidentiary, worth unless and until it is authenticated by
 judgment . . . [and] . . . heirs at law [are not] barred as
 contestants by prior unprobated wills."); In re Will of Stern,
 311 P.2d 385 (N.M. 1957). In Marr, the testator's daughters
 petitioned to have their mother's will invalidated on the grounds
 of undue influence. 267 P. at 10. The court rejected the
 respondent's argument that because a prior unprobated will
 disinherited the plaintiffs, "they have no concern with the
 validity or invalidity of the later will." Id. Instead, the
 
court responded by stating
 
the [earlier will] was never probated. Until that is done,
a will is merely "a scrap of paper," mayhap of some
evidential significance - no more. A will neither confers
 rights on its named beneficiaries nor deprives heirs of
their rights until it has passed the scrutiny of the probate
court; and its presentation for probate and some action
favorable or unfavorable thereon by that tribunal are
prerequisites to a contest over its validity in a court of
general jurisdiction.
 
Id. The court further stated that the will "was not offered for
 
probate," therefore, "the mother's estate would have to be
 
755 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/1-2.11 (West 2011).
 
12
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
regarded as an intestacy" and would descend to the litigants in
 
equal shares. Id. The Marr court thus held that the daughters
 
had the right to contest the subsequent will as heirs-at-law. 
Id. at 11.
 
The Wong Appellees argue that this line of reasoning is 
in conflict with the presumption against intestacy. We disagree. It does not appear that the presumption against intestacy has ever been held to outweigh the public policy against a fraudulently or otherwise improperly induced will. In In re Trust Estate of Weill, the Hawai' i Supreme court reported that 
the presumption against intestacy or partial intestacy is a
strong one. . . . The law abhors intestacy and presumes
against it. A testator is presumed to have intended the
disposition of his entire estate for the benefit of the
beneficiaries named in his will. 
48 Haw. 553, 563, 406 P.2d 718, 724 (1965) (internal citations
 
and quotation marks omitted). In Weill, the supreme court stated
 that presumption against intestacy allows the courts to "seek the
 intention of the testator from a study of the will as a whole"
 such that the intention of the testator can be effectuated. Id. 
This presumption also gives the courts the power to "depart from
 the strict wording of the will, to mold or change its language,
 such as, by rejecting superfluous, absurd or repugnant words or
 phrases or restricting them in their application." Id. at 563­
64, 406 P.2d at 724. Neither this case, nor any of the cases the
 Weill court relies on, deal with the alleged invalidity of the
 testator's will or circumstances involving an unprobated will. 
Instead, the presumption against intestacy applies where the
 intention of the testator is clear and can be effectuated by
 adjusting otherwise inconsistent, contradictory, or unworkable
 terms. Common sense dictates that the presumption against
 intestacy does not govern where there has been a testamentary
 instrument that might be invalidated for lack of capacity or
 proven to be a product of undue influence. In sum, under the
 circumstances present in this case, the presumption against

intestacy does not strip Kailieha of standing to contest a
 
testamentary instrument alleged to be a product of undue
 influence and due to incapacity. 
For these reasons and under the facts presented in this
 
case, we conclude that Kailieha is an interested person and has
 standing to challenge the 1996 Will and Joint Trust. 
Accordingly, the Probate Court erred in entering summary judgment
 against her and in favor of the Wong Appellees.
 
B. The Motion for Reconsideration
 In light of our conclusion that the Circuit Court erred
 
in granting summary judgment against Kailieha, we need not
 address whether the Circuit Court abused its discretion in
 denying reconsideration.
 V. CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, the Probate Court's July 9, 2008 Final
 
Judgment is vacated and this case is remanded for further
 proceedings.
