APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
This is an appeal from two consolidated civil actions. 
In Civil No. 05-1-0534, a personal injury action arising out of
 
alleged exposure to asbestos in an apartment unit at 2895
 Kalakaua Avenue, Plaintiff-Appellant Debra Heverly-Campbell and
 
her daughter, Plaintiff Jade Heverly-Campbell (collectively the
 
Heverly-Campbells) brought suit against Defendants-Appellees
 
Colony Surf, Ltd., W.E. Denison Corporation, William E. Denison,
 Mary Lou Leslie, Paul Leonard, individually and as Trustee of the
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Paul and Dorit Leonard Family Trust, Costa's Plumbing Co., Inc.,
 
and Richard E. Costa (collectively Defendants-Appellees). As to
 this action, Debra Heverly-Campbell appeals from the Final
 Judgment entered on June 26, 2008 by the Circuit Court of the
 First Circuit (circuit court)
1 in favor of all Defendants-
Appellees and against the Heverly-Campbells.2
 
In Civil No. 05-1-1759, Plaintiff-Counterclaim
 
Defendant-Appellee Robert S. Thue (Thue) filed a complaint
 against Defendant Debra Heverly-Campbell seeking unpaid amounts
 owed under a contract to rent the apartment unit at 2895 Kalakaua
 Avenue. Debra Heverly-Campbell filed a counterclaim against Thue
 and filed a Third-Party Complaint against Linda Ching Thue (Ching
 Thue) alleging various causes of action. As to this action,
 
Debra Heverly-Campbell appeals from the Final Default Judgment
 entered on July 1, 2008, which entered default judgment against
 Debra Heverly-Campbell as to Thue's claim and dismissed all other
 claims.
 
On appeal, Debra Heverly-Campbell (Appellant), pro se,
 
asserts a single point of error, that the circuit court abused
 its discretion "in granting defendants' motion pursuant to HRCP
 37 to dismiss the complaint for failure to appear for an
 independent medical examination and failure to appear for
 depositions." She contends that "defendants failed to
 demonstrate entitlement to dismissal of the action because there
 was no evidence of any deliberate, willful or contumacious
 behavior by the plaintiffs with respect to any court ordered
 discovery." She ends her point of error section by stating
 
"dismissal of the complaint under these [c]ircumstances was in
 error, constituted abuse of discretion, and the order should be
 reversed."
 
1 The Honorable Victoria S. Marks presided.
 
2 The Notice of Appeal was executed only by Debra Heverly-Campbell, pro
 
se, and she is thus the only appellant in this appeal.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Appellant Heverly-Campbell does not present any point
 
of error or argument regarding the circuit court's May 16, 2008
 
summary judgment order in favor of all Defendants-Appellees in
 Civil No. 05-1-0534. 
As to Civil No. 05-1-1759, Appellant Heverly-Campbell
3
 
presents no point of error or argument challenging the summary
 judgment order in favor of Thue and Ching Thue as to Heverly­Campbell's defenses and most of her claims, the circuit court's
 order dismissing any and all of her claims, or the default
 judgment in favor of Thue on his claim for breach of contract.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced, the issues raised by the parties, and the
 
relevant authorities, we resolve Appellant Heverly-Campbell's
 appeal as follows.
 
(1) As an initial matter, Appellant Heverly-Campbell's 
opening brief fails to comply with Rule 28 of the Hawai» i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP). It fails to: provide references to the record on appeal for numerous statements of fact and for mentioned court proceedings; it fails to state where in the record the alleged error occurred; it fails to state where in the record the alleged error was objected to or the manner it was brought to the attention of the circuit court. We may therefore disregard Appellant Heverly-Campbell's point of error. See In re 
Contested Case Hearing on Water Use Permit Application Filed by Kukui (Molokai), Inc., 116 Hawai» i 481, 506, 174 P.3d 320, 345 
(2007). Even if we do not disregard her point of error, we 
conclude Appellant Heverly-Campbell's appeal does not have merit. 
(2) The circuit court's Final Judgment in Civil 
No. 05-1-0534 and the Final Default Judgment in Civil No. 05-1-1759 are sustainable on grounds which are unchallenged by Appellant Heverly-Campbell. See Wong v. Cayetano, 111 Hawai» i 
462, 479-81, 143 P.3d 1, 18-20 (2006).

 Jade Heverly-Campbell was not a party in Civil No. 05-1-1759.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
With regard to Civil No. 05-1-0534, the personal injury
 
action, the circuit court's order filed on May 16, 2008 granted
 
summary judgment in favor of all Defendants-Appellees. The
 circuit court granted summary judgment after evidence was
 presented by the Defendants-Appellees that the Heverly-Campbells'
 alleged exposure to asbestos in their apartment did not cause any
 physical harm and, in turn, the Heverly-Campbells failed to
 submit evidence in response such that there was no genuine issue
 of material fact as to causation or damages. Appellant Heverly-
Campbell has not raised any point of error regarding the grant of
 summary judgment in favor of all Defendants-Appellees in Civil
 No. 05-1-0534, and therefore, the Final Judgment in that action
 is supported by unchallenged grounds.
 
With regard to Civil No. 05-1-1759, the circuit court's
 
May 16, 2008 order also granted summary judgment in favor of
 
Plaintiff Thue "as to all of Defendant Debra Heverly-Campbell's
 defenses" and in favor of Counterclaim Defendant Thue and Third-
Party Defendant Laura Ching Thue (Laura Ching Thue) "as to all of
 Debra Heverly-Campbell's claims, except for Defendant Heverly­Campbell's claim for personal property damage." Subsequently, on
 May 28, 2008, the circuit court granted Thue and Laura Ching
 Thue's motion to dismiss any and all claims by Debra Heverly-
Campbell in that action. On July 1, 2008, the circuit court then
 entered the Final Default Judgment. Appellant Heverly-Campbell
 has raised no point of error regarding Civil No. 05-1-1759, and
 therefore, the Final Default Judgment in that action is 
unchallenged.
 
(3) We also conclude that Appellant Heverly-Campbell's 
point of error does not have merit. We review for abuse of 
discretion whether the circuit court erred in sanctioning Appellant Heverly-Campbell pursuant to Rule 37 of the Hawai» i 
Rules of Civil Procedure by dismissing the complaint due to the 
Heverly-Campbells' failure to comply with discovery, including 
discovery ordered by the court. In re Blaisdell , 125 Hawai» i 44, 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
48, 252 P.3d 63, 67 (2011); Kawamata Farms, Inc. v. United Agri 
Prods., 86 Hawai» i 214, 241, 948 P.2d 1055, 1082 (1997). 
The record establishes that extensive efforts were made
 
to obtain discovery in the form of independent medical
 
examinations (IMEs) and depositions of the Heverly-Campbells,
 with which they failed to comply. Particularly significant, the
 Heverly-Campbells failed to comply with two orders by the circuit
 court requiring that they submit to IMEs and depositions, the
 last instance occurring after the court had already awarded
 attorneys' fees and costs for their previous failure to comply
 and with an already continued trial set to commence in three
 months.
 
The circuit court first ordered that the Heverly-
Campbells attend IMEs on August 29, 2006 or make arrangements to
 
reschedule the examinations to a mutually convenient date and
 time no later than August 15, 2006. Instead, Appellant Heverly-
Campbell does not contest the Appellees' assertions that she
 unilaterally cancelled the August 29, 2006 IMEs and did not
 reschedule as ordered by the circuit court.
 
A motion for sanctions was filed, a hearing was held on
 
October 11, 2006, and in an order filed on December 7, 2006, the
 circuit court denied the motion to the extent it sought dismissal
 against the Heverly-Campbells, but granted attorneys' fees and
 costs against them. The court further ordered that the Heverly-
Campbells' respective depositions and IMEs be completed no later
 than December 15, 2006. This order further allowed that should
 the Heverly-Campbells be unable to attend their depositions
 
and/or IMEs, that they provide timely notice and seek appropriate
 relief by motion.
 
The Heverly-Campbells thereafter filed a motion seeking
 
to extend the deadline for their IMEs and depositions, which the
 circuit court granted. Additionally, the circuit court continued
 
the trial, which had then been scheduled for May 28, 2007.
 
Subsequently, after further attempts to schedule the
 
IMEs and depositions of the Heverly-Campbells, another motion was
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
filed on December 28, 2007 to compel the discovery. The Heverly-
Campbells did not file a response but in correspondence to the circuit court dated January 20, 2008, Appellant Heverly-Campbell stated that they were willing to attend IMEs and depositions in Hawai» i in March 2008 at the expense of the defendants, that they 
were willing to do both in New York at any time, and that they were willing to attend IMEs and depositions in Hawai» i in April 
2008 at their expense. Eight days later, in a letter dated January 28, 2008 sent to the circuit court, Appellant Heverly-Campbell changed her position and stated Jade was not well enough to travel at that time. No medical evidence supporting this statement was provided. Moreover, although Appellant Heverly-Campbell asserts on appeal that a subsequent letter dated 
January 30, 2008 was sent to the circuit court with a doctor's note, no such correspondence is part of the record, the document she attaches in her appendix on appeal does not contain a court file-stamp (unlike the January 20 and 28, 2008 correspondence), and even if the January 30, 2008 letter were part of the record, the doctor's note is completely unverified. 
A hearing was held on February 4, 2008 and the circuit 
court issued an order on March 4, 2008, requiring the Heverly-Campbells to attend IMEs and depositions in Hawai» i anytime during 
the month of March 2008, the dates and times to be selected by defense counsel. At that point, trial was scheduled to commence on June 2, 2008 and thus the circuit court also extended the discovery deadline. 
Following the circuit court's March 4, 2008 order, on 
March 7, 2008, the Heverly-Campbells submitted a response to the 
order stating that they were not able to travel to Hawai» i for the 
next two to three months due to Jade's health and attached an unverified letter from a doctor apparently treating Jade. Also on March 7, 2008, Appellant Heverly-Campbell sent correspondence 
to counsel in the case stating that she and Jade would not be 
attending IMEs or depositions in the month of March 2008.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
On March 12, 2008, a motion for dismissal of all claims
 
asserted by the Heverly-Campbells was filed by the Costa
 
Defendants-Appellees and joined by the other defendants in
 Civil No. 05-1-0534. The circuit court granted this motion as
 set forth in an order filed on May 5, 2008.
 
On this record, and contrary to the arguments by
 
Appellant Heverly-Campbell, there is abundant evidence in the
 record of deliberate, willful and contumacious conduct on the
 part of the Heverly-Campbells in failing to comply with
 discovery, including the court ordered IMEs and depositions.
 
Based on the above, and the record in this case, the 
circuit court did not abuse its discretion in sanctioning the Heverly-Campbells by granting dismissal of their claims in Civil 
No. 05-1-0534. See Aloha Unlimited, Inc. v. Coughlin, 79 Hawai» i 
527, 533-36, 904 P.2d 541, 547-50 (App. 1995). 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the Final Judgment entered on
 
June 26, 2008 in Civil No. 05-1-0534 and the Final Default
 Judgment entered on July 1, 2008 in Civil No. 05-1-1759 are
 affirmed.
