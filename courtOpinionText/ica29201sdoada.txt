NO. 29201
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
ROXANNE RIVERO, Claimant-Appellee, v.
RICHARD SCHIAVI, Respondent-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P. NO. 07-1-0080)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Respondent-Appellant Richard Schiavi (Schiavi) appeals 
from the May 13, 2008 orders of the Circuit Court of the First 
Circuit that (1) granted Claimant-Appellee Roxanne Rivero's 
(Rivero) motion to confirm final award of arbitrator, and (2) 
denied Schiavi's motion to confirm in part and to vacate and/or 
correct in part the final award of arbitrator, dated February 27, 
2008.1/ Absent the entry of a separate final judgment, this 
court does not have appellate jurisdiction over an order denying a motion to vacate and/or an order denying a motion to correct an 
arbitration award. See Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 641-1(a) 
(1993 & Supp. 2007) & 658A-28 (Supp. 2007); Jenkins v. Cades 
Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 869 P.2d 1334 (1994). 
However, it appears that disposition of the issues raised by Schiavi with respect to the order confirming the arbitration

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
award will, in effect, address Schiavi's arguments for vacating
 
and/or correcting in part the arbitration award.
 
Appearing pro se on appeal, Schiavi's brief fails to 
include a concise statement of points of error, fails to state where in the record the alleged errors occurred and were objected 
to, fails to provide any record references supporting his factual 
assertions, and otherwise fails to comply with Hawai
'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b). Nevertheless, as the 
policy of the Hawai 'i appellate courts is to permit litigants to 
appeal and to have their cases heard on the merits, to the extent 
possible, we have carefully reviewed and considered Schiavi's 
arguments. See O'Connor v. Diocese of Honolulu, 77 Hawai 'i 383, 
386, 885 P.2d 361, 364 (1994). 
Schiavi appears to contend that the Circuit Court erred
 
in confirming in its entirety (and failing to partially vacate)
 the arbitration award on the following grounds: (1) evident
 
partiality and corruption; (2) insufficient notice; (3)
 
mathematical error; (4) contravention of public policy and
 
manifest disregard of law; and (5) violation of the arbitrator's
 
scope of powers.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Schiavi's contentions as follows:
 
(1) It appears that Schiavi did not raise the issue of 
evident partiality either before or during the arbitration, or in 
the proceedings before the Circuit Court. Schiavi's failure to 
raise the issue of the arbitrator's alleged evident partiality 
prior to or during the arbitration proceeding constituted a 
waiver of the issue for the purpose of challenging the 
confirmation of the arbitrator's award on these grounds. Daiichi 
Haw. Real Estate Corp. v. Lichter, 103 Hawai
'i 325, 345-46, 82 
P.3d 411, 431-32 (2003). Indeed, evident partiality does not 
2  
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
arise from an arbitrator's failure to accord weight or
 
credibility to one party's evidence over that of another, as is
 
argued here by Schiavi. Schiavi's allegations regarding certain
 
mutual acquaintances or known associates of the arbitrator are
 
not supported by the record in this case. See HRS § 641-2
 
("Every appeal shall be taken on the record."). Similarly,
 Schiavi has not properly raised or supported his assertion of
 
corruption.
 
(2) Schiavi argues that Rivero failed to provide
 
sufficient notice upon initiating the arbitration proceeding. 
HRS § 658A-9 (2001) requires such notice to describe the "nature
 
of the controversy and the remedy sought." However, an objection
 
based on insufficient notice is waived unless raised before
 
arbitration commences. Id. Based on the record before us, we
 
conclude that Schiavi raised no such objections. To the
 contrary, Schiavi successfully objected to several of Rivero's
 
claims on arbitrability grounds. The Circuit Court thereafter
 
ordered arbitration on the remaining claims. These events negate
 
Schiavi's argument that the notice insufficiently described the
 
nature of the controversy and remedies sought. This argument is
 
without merit.
 
(3) HRS § 658A-24(a)(1) (2001) allows courts to
 
correct or modify arbitration awards due to "an evident
 
mathematical miscalculation." Schiavi argues that the arbitrator
 
erred in applying a 2% per annum fair market value determination
 
under paragraph 9.3(a) of the agreement between the parties. He
 
maintains that the clause at issue was intended to set a minimum
 
fair market value. In so arguing, Schiavi raises an issue of
 
contractual interpretation. Section 658A-24(a)(1) concerns
 
errors in mathematical calculations, not in contract
 
interpretation. Schiavi also contends that the arbitrator made a
 
"mathematical mistake" in construing the definition of "tenant"
 
under the agreement. Despite his creative attempt to frame this
 
3  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
argument in mathematical terms, it remains an issue of contract
 
interpretation vested in the arbitrator.
 
(4) In addition to statutory grounds, the Hawai 'i 
courts have adopted a narrow ground for setting aside arbitration 
awards that violate public policy. Inlandboatmen's Union v. 
Sause Bros., Inc., 77 Hawai 'i 187, 193-94, 881 P.2d 1255, 1261-62 
(App. 1994). The test is whether "(1) the award would violate 
some explicit public policy that is well defined and dominant, 
and that is ascertained by reference to the laws and legal 
precedents and not from general considerations of supposed public 
interests, and (2) the violation of the public policy is clearly 
shown." Id. at 193-94, 881 P.2d at 1261-62 (internal quotation 
marks, brackets, and ellipses omitted; punctuation altered) (quoting United Paperworkers Int'l Union v. Misco, Inc., 484 U.S. 
29, 43 (1987)). Schiavi contends that the award violates the 
public policy against forfeitures of interests in real 
property.
2/ However, the cases on which he relies evince general 
principles of equity, not a well-defined, dominant, and explicit public policy. See Jenkins v. Wise, 58 Haw. 592, 596-97, 574 
P.2d 1337, 1341 (1978); Food Pantry Ltd. v. Waikiki Bus. Plaza, Inc., 58 Haw. 606, 614, 575 P.2d 869, 876 (1978). The public 
policy exception is not a vehicle to set aside arbitration awards 
for factual or legal error. Inlandboatmen's Union, 77 Hawai
'i at 
196, 881 P.2d at 1264. Schiavi's argument would require us to examine the arbitrator's reasoning and determine whether the 
alleged forfeiture was appropriate under equitable principles. 
The exception does not permit such an inquiry into the reasoning 
of the arbitrator. 
Schiavi similarly asserts an argument that the award
 
evinces "manifest disregard" of the law. On the record before
 
2/
 Schiavi loosely asserts this argument under the "manifest
disregard for the law" framework. In the court below, he expressly advocated
the public policy exception. 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
us, we cannot conclude that the arbitrator disregarded principles 
of equity by giving effect to the forfeiture provision in the 
parties' agreement. Schiavi also argues that the arbitrator 
disregarded the law by "ignoring" evidence regarding the alleged 
tenancy and joint account. He further maintains that the 
arbitrator applied the wrong meaning of the term "tenant." These 
are factual and legal determinations that are not subject to our 
review. Schiavi has failed to demonstrate that the arbitrator 
obviously disregarded, rather than misinterpreted, applicable 
law. See Tatibouet v. Ellsworth, 99 Hawai 'i 226, 234, 54 P.3d 
397, 405 (2002). 
(5) Schiavi argues that the arbitrator ignored the 
express terms of the agreement by failing to find Rivero in default as a result of her underpayment. As discussed above, 
appellate review of arbitration awards is significantly limited 
by statute. Under HRS § 658A-23(a)(4), courts may vacate an 
award if the arbitrator exceeded his or her powers. This 
provision applies, however, only where the arbitrator "manifestly 
exceed[ed] the agreement between the parties." Tatibouet, 99 
Hawai
'i at 234, 54 P.3d at 405. Because the arbitrator's 
authority is rooted in the parties' agreement, an award is valid 
so long as it "draws its essence from the arbitration agreement." 
Id. at 235, 54 P.3d at 406 (internal quotation marks and citation 
omitted). Although Schiavi makes a cogent – perhaps compelling – 
argument that the arbitrator failed to correctly interpret and 
apply the terms of the parties' agreement, the award here does 
not concern a non-arbitrable matter. We may not vacate an award 
for errors of law or erroneous interpretations of the contract. 
Tatibouet, 99 Hawai 'i at 233, 54 P.2d at 404.
