APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 04-1-1375)
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Proposed Intervenors-Appellants Catherine Marn
 
Oberholzer (Catherine), in her individual capacity and as
 
successor trustee of the irrevocable trusts of Ryan Duck Quon Yee
 Marn, Mark E. Uyemura, Sheri Ann M. Uyemura, and Patrick K.Y.
 Marn (collectively, "Proposed Intervenors"), appeal from the
 following orders of the Circuit Court for the First Circuit
 (Circuit Court): (1) "Order Denying Motion to Intervene, Filed
 February 6, 2008" (Order Denying Motion to Intervene), which was
 entered on April 1, 2008; and (2) "Order Denying Motion for New
 Trial, to Amend Judgment, and to Reconsider Order Entered April
 1, 2008" (Order Denying Reconsideration), which was entered on
 May 24, 2008.

I.
 
On appeal, Proposed Intervenors argue that the Circuit 
Court erred in: (1) denying their motion to intervene as a matter of right, pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) 
Rule 24(a)(2) (2006); (2) denying their motion to intervene requesting permissive intervention, pursuant to HRCP Rule 24(b)(2) (2006); and (3) denying their motion for a new trial, to amend findings, and to reconsider the Order Denying Motion to Intervene. We affirm. 
II.
 
We resolve the arguments raised by Proposed Intervenors
 
on appeal as follows:
 
(1) The Circuit Court did not err in denying Proposed
 
Intervenors' motion for intervention as of right. In order to
 establish their entitlement to intervene as of right under HRCP
 Rule 24(a)(2), Proposed Intervenors must show that: (1) their
 motion for intervention was timely; (2) they claimed "an interest
 relating to the property or transaction which was the subject of
 the action"; (3) "the disposition of the action would, as a
 practical matter, impair or impede [their] ability to protect
 
1 The Honorable Victoria S. Marks presided.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that interest"; and (4) their interest was inadequately 
represented by existing parties. Baehr v. Miike, 80 Hawai' i 341, 
343, 910 P.2d 112, 114 (1996) (block quote format and brackets ommitted). Proposed Intervenors must satisfy all of these requirements, and the "[f]ailure to meet even one prevents intervention 'by right' under HRCP Rule 24(a)(2)." Id. at 345, 
910 P.2d at 116. 
The Circuit Court specifically ruled that Proposed
 
Intervenors' motion to intervene was not timely filed, and we
 focus on the timeliness requirement. Timeliness is a "flexible
 concept," and the determination of timeliness "is a matter within
 the sound discretion of the trial court." Kim v. H.V. Corp., 5
 
Haw. App. 298, 301, 688 P.2d 1158, 1161 (1984). In making this
 determination, the trial court must consider all the
 circumstances, with two particularly relevant circumstances being
 "1) the lapse of time between when the applicant should have
 sought intervention and when it actually did and 2) the prejudice
 caused to the existing parties by that lapse of time." Id. at
 
301-02, 688 P.2d at 1161 (citation omitted).
 
Here, the original complaint was filed almost three
 
years before, and the First Supplemental Complaint was filed
 eight months before, the Proposed Intervenors' motion for
 intervention; the predecessor co-trustee of the Proposed
 Intervenors' trusts and of Catherine's former trust had knowledge
 of the litigation from its inception; and the motion for
 intervention was not filed in this protracted litigation until
 after the Circuit Court had already held a bench trial and had
 also largely ruled in favor of Plaintiff James Y. Marn, Jr., on
 pre-trial motions for preliminary injunction and partial summary
 judgment. We conclude that the Circuit Court did not abuse its
 discretion in determining that Proposed Intervenors' motion for
 intervention was untimely and that the Circuit Court did not err
 in denying Proposed Intervenors' motion for intervention as of
 right under HRCP Rule 24(a)(2).
 
(2) A timely motion for intervention is also a
 
required condition for permissive intervention under HRCP Rule
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
24(b)(2). Accordingly, we conclude that the Circuit Court did
 
not abuse its discretion in denying Proposed Intervenors' request
 for permissive intervention.
 
(3) Proposed Intervenors' sole basis for challenging
 
the Circuit Court's Order Denying Reconsideration is that the
 Circuit Court should have granted Proposed Intervenors' motion
 for intervention. Because we conclude that the Circuit Court did
 not err in denying Proposed Intervenors' motion for intervention,
 we reject Proposed Intervenors' challenge to the Order Denying
 Reconsideration.
 
III.
 
We affirm the Circuit Court's Order Denying Motion to
 
Intervene and Order Denying Reconsideration.
