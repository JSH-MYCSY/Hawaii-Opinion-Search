On appeal, Kuleana contends the circuit court erred in
 
affirming the decision of LUC because LUC erred:
 
(1) in deciding it lacked jurisdiction concerning
 
Issues 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 of Kuleana's Petition For Declaratory
 
Order (Petition);
 
(2) in confining the hearing on Issue 1 of the
 
petition to the question of whether the past and proposed uses of
 
agricultural lands by Appellees were not in conformity with and

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
were in direct violation of applicable state laws and
 
regulations;
 
(3) in ruling Kuleana would not be entitled to a
 
hearing on Issue 5 of the Petition until after an affirmative
 
finding on Issue 1;
 
(4) in finding Kuleana would not be allowed to present
 
evidence during the hearing concerning the lack of sufficient
 
water necessary to use the property at issue for agricultural
 
purposes; and
 
(5) in deciding Kuleana would not be allowed to
 
provide evidence concerning the infringements upon Hawaiian
 
rights.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On July 22, 2004, Kuleana filed its Petition requesting 
LUC to issue a declaratory ruling pursuant to Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) § 91-8 (1993) and Hawaii Administrative Rules 
(HAR) § 15-15-98. Kuleana sought a declaratory order determining 
that certain lands adjacent to land owned by Kuleana or its 
members were being used in violation of State of Hawai' i and 
County of Maui laws. The lands at issue are known as Pu' unoa I, 
II and III Subdivisions, and Kaua' ula Subdivision (collectively, 
Subdivisions). Specifically, Kuleana raised seven issues: 
1. The current and proposed uses of lands by the developers
and land owners are not in conformity with and are in direct
violation of county and State laws, rules, and regulations
pertaining to uses of agricultural lands;
 
2. It was improper for the County of Maui to approve the
agricultural subdivisions without first determining that
there was an adequate supply of non-potable water to support
compliance with the agricultural zoning requirements by each
lot owner, and that it was improper for the County of Maui
to approve building permits to land owners in the
subdivisions without first determining that there was an
adequate supply of water and proper soil conditions which
are needed to support the required level of farming on the
lots;
 
3. The waters of Kaua' ula Stream are a valued cultural,
historic and natural resource and that the native Hawaiian 
tenants in the Kaua' ula Valley have the right to practice
their traditional and customary rights, including the rightto use the waters of the Kaua' ula Stream for traditional and 
customary uses, and that their rights in that regard areadversely affected by removing the water for use on thesubdivision properties;  
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
4. The current and proposed uses of the lands in the
subdivisions do not comply with the purposes or intent of
specified constitutional and statutory provisions regulating
the uses of agricultural lands;
 
5. The County of Maui's system of enforcement, practice of taking
no enforcement measures or taking only after-the-fact
enforcement measures concerning the use of agricultural
lands does not conform to the statutory provisions
regulating the uses of agricultural lands;
 
6. The actions of the developers and landowners concerning
the current and proposed developments are creating and will
create an interruption of the natural and historic flows ofwaters in the Kaua' ula Stream resulting in damages to the
entire eco-system of the streambed and that such actions donot conform with HRS § 205-17; and 
7. The lands along the Kaua' ula Stream required protection
and preservation.
 On December 14, 2005, LUC adopted its "Order
 
Dismissing Issues 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 and Setting Issues 1 and 5 of
 
Petition for Declaratory Order for Hearing," (Dismissal Order) 
ruling that it lacked jurisdiction to address Issues 2, 3, 4, 
and 6. LUC dismissed Issue 7 on the ground that Kuleana had not
 
demonstrated any ownership interest in the lands adjacent to its
 
property. LUC set a hearing on Issue 1 pursuant to HAR 
§§ 15-15-100 and 15-15-103. LUC decided to set a hearing on
 
Issue 5 only upon an affirmative finding on Issue 1.
 
After the hearing on Issue 1, LUC issued its "Findings
 
of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Decision and Order" (LUC Order)
 on April 10, 2006. The LUC held that Kuleana "failed to meet its
 
burden of proof that the present and proposed uses of
 
agricultural lands on the [Subdivisions] are not in conformity
 
with and are in direct violation of applicable State laws, rules,
 
and regulations[.]"
 
On April 26, 2006, Kuleana appealed the LUC Order and
 
the Dismissal Order to the circuit court. On June 29, 2007,
 
after briefing and argument, the circuit court entered its Order
 
affirming the LUC Order and Dismissal Order. On June 10, 2008,
 
the circuit court entered Final Judgment. On July 8, 2008,
 
Kuleana timely filed its notice of appeal.
 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
4
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Review of a decision made by the circuit court upon
its review of an agency's decision is a secondary appeal.
In an appeal from a circuit court's review of an
administrative decision the appellate court will utilize
identical standards applied by the circuit court. Questions
of fact are reviewed under the "clearly erroneous" standard.
In contrast, an agency's legal conclusions are freely
reviewable. An agency's interpretation of its rules
receives deference unless it is plainly erroneous or
inconsistent with the underlying legislative purpose.
 
Hawaii Teamsters & Allied Workers, Local 996 v. Dep't of Labor & 
Indus. Relations, 110 Hawai' i 259, 265, 132 P.3d 368, 374 (2006) 
(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
A.	 LUC properly limited its jurisdiction to issues of
state law (Issues 1 and 2).
 
Kuleana argues that LUC erred in its decision that it
 
lacked jurisdiction concerning Issue 2 of the Petition. Kuleana
 
also argues that LUC "erred in its decision that it would confine
 
the hearing on [Issue 1] to the question of whether the past and
 
proposed uses of agricultural lands . . . are in direct violation
 
of applicable State laws[.]" (Emphasis added) As stated above,
 
Kuleana contended in Issue 2 that 
[i]t was improper for the County of Maui to approve
the agricultural subdivisions without first determining that
there was an adequate supply of non-potable water to support
compliance with the agricultural zoning requirements by each
lot owner, and that it was improper for the County of Maui
to approve building permits to land owners in the
subdivisions without first determining that there was an
adequate supply of water and proper soil conditions which
are needed to support the required level of farming on the
lots[.]
 
On appeal, Kuleana argues that LUC has "jurisdiction to require
 
that counties fulfill their responsibilities regarding
 
enforcement" of county and state laws and regulations.
 
"[I]t is fundamental that authority to zone is 
conferred by the legislature on the counties." Save Sunset Beach 
Coalition v. City and Cnty. of Honolulu, 102 Hawai' i 465, 481, 
78 P.3d 1, 17 (2003). "The counties of our state derive their 
zoning powers from HRS § 46-4." Kaiser Hawaii Kai Dev. Co. v. 
City and Cnty. of Honolulu, 70 Haw. 480, 483, 777 P.2d 244, 246 
5
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(1989). The counties were clearly granted the power to enforce
 
and regulate zoning. 
Furthermore, under HRS § 205-12 (2001 Repl.) the
 
counties, not LUC, are charged with enforcing use classification
 
districts. HRS § 205-12 provides that "[t]he appropriate
 
officer or agency charged with the administration of county
 
zoning laws shall enforce within each county the use
 
classification districts adopted by the land use commission and
 
the restriction on use and the condition relating to agricultural
 
districts under section 205-4.5[.]"
 
The counties were clearly granted the power to enforce 
and regulate zoning. Kuleana cites to no authority that would 
give LUC the power to oversee county zoning and regulations. "An 
administrative agency can only wield powers expressly or 
implicitly granted to it by statute. Implied powers are limited 
to those reasonably necessary to make an express power 
effective." TIG Ins. Co. v. Kauhane, 101 Hawai' i 311, 328, 67 
P.3d 810, 827 (App. 2003) (internal quotation marks, brackets and citation omitted). LUC simply does not have the authority to 
approve or condemn county actions; therefore, LUC did not err in 
finding it lacked jurisdiction over Issue 2, nor did it err by 
limiting Issue 1 to questions of state law.
2 
B.	 LUC did not have jurisdiction over Issues 3, 4, 6,
and 7.
 
1.	 Without the need for a reclassification of
 district boundaries, HRS § 205-17 (Supp. 2011)
does not confer jurisdiction to LUC over Issues 3,
4, 6, and 7. 
Under Issues 3 and 4, Kuleana argues that native
 
Hawaiian traditional and customary rights are being adversely
 
2
 Kuleana also argues on appeal that LUC erred in ruling that a hearing
on Issue 5 would only be set upon an affirmative finding of Issue 1. Issue 5
 
alleges that County of Maui failed to enforce state agricultural rules and
regulations. However, under Issue 1, LUC did not find any violation of state
agricultural rules or regulations. Kuleana fails to cite to any authority
that would require LUC to review County of Maui's enforcement of state law
absent a finding that those laws have been violated.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
affected by the use of the Subdivisions, and that such uses are 
prohibited under HRS § 205-17. Similarly, Issues 6 and 7 contend 
that the use of the Subdivisions interrupts the flow of Kaua' ula 
Stream and damages the eco-system in violation of HRS § 205-17.3 
While it is true that HRS § 205-17 requires LUC to take
 
into account the preservation or maintenance of cultural
 historical or natural resources, HRS § 205-17 governs LUC's
 
review of a petition for reclassification of district boundaries. 
A district boundary amendment from LUC was never sought and, as
 
LUC's findings on Issue 1 indicate, an amendment was not needed
 
because the proposed use of the Subdivisions' lots was for
 
agricultural purposes. As such, LUC does not have jurisdiction
 
over Issues 3, 4, 6, and 7 under HRS § 205-17. 
2.	 The declaratory ruling procedure under HRS § 91-8
is not a proper means to seek review of County of
Maui decisions.
 
In addition to its HRS § 205-17 argument, Kuleana 
argued under Issue 3 and 4 that LUC had jurisdiction to order the 
Subdivisions to comply with the laws regarding traditional access 
rights under Article XII, section 7 of the Hawai' i Constitution.
4 
Similarly, with respect to Issues 6 and 7, Kuleana argues that Article XI, section 7 places a duty on the State and its 
political subdivisions "to protect, control and regulate the use 
of Hawai' i's water resources for the benefit of its people." 
While it is true that the State and its political

 Kuleana also argues LUC erred in not allowing Kuleana to provide
evidence concerning adequate supply of water for agricultural uses, and
evidence regarding the alleged infringements upon Hawaiian rights (points on
appeal 4 and 5). In those points, Kuleana merely rehashes arguments made
concerning LUC's dismissal of Issues 3, 4, 5, and 6; as such, those arguments
are addressed here.

 Article XII, section 7 of the Hawai' i Constitution states: 
The State reaffirms and shall protect all rights,
customarily and traditionally exercised for subsistence,cultural and religious purposes and possessed byahupua'a tenants who are descendants of native Hawaiians 
who inhabited the Hawaiian Islands prior to 1778,subject to the right of the State to regulate suchrights. 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
subdivisions have a constitutional duty to protect both Native 
Hawaiian rights and natural resources, the effect of the 
Subdivisions on the constitutional rights of Kuleana and its 
members has already been answered by County of Maui. Both 
Article XI, section 7 and Article XII, section 7 apply to the 
counties as well as the state. Public Access Shoreline Hawaii v. 
Hawai'i Cnty. Planning Com'n, 79 Hawai' i 425, 437, 903 P.2d 1246, 
1258 (1995); Kelly v. 1250 Oceanside Partners, 111 Hawai' i 205, 
226, 140 P.3d 985, 1006 (2006). On April 27, 2001 and April 24, 2003, County of Maui gave final approval for phases I and II of 
the Subdivisions, respectively. Any question as to the 
Subdivisions' effect on Native Hawaiian rights or natural 
resources under the constitution was impliedly answered when 
County of Maui approved the Subdivisions. Thus, by seeking a 
declaratory ruling from LUC under HRS § 91-8 as to the 
constitutional implications of the Subdivisions, Kuleana is 
essentially seeking review of County of Maui's approval of the 
Subdivisions. 
The Hawai' i Supreme Court has already decided the scope 
of HRS § 91-8. "[T]he declaratory ruling procedure of HRS § 91–8 
is meant to provide a means of seeking a determination of whether 
and in what way some statute, agency rule, or order, applies to 
the factual situation raised by an interested person. It was not 
intended to allow review of concrete agency decisions for which 
other means of review are available." Citizens Against Reckless 
Dev. v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals of City and Cnty. of Honolulu, 114 Hawai'i 184, 196-97, 159 P.3d 143, 155-56 (2007). The supreme 
court held that under the plain reading of HRS § 91-8 "it cannot seriously be maintained that the procedure was intended to review 
already-made agency decisions." Id. at 197, 159 P.3d at 156. 
The supreme court reasoned that "[u]se of the
 
declaratory ruling procedural device only makes sense where the
 
applicability of relevant law is unknown, either because the
 
agency has not yet acted upon particular factual circumstances,
 
or for some other reason the applicability of some provisions of
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
law have not been brought into consideration." Id. The supreme
 
court further reasoned that "the legislature acted intentionally
 
when it chose the term 'applicability' to denote a special type
 
of procedure, whereby an interested party could seek agency
 
advice as to how a statute, agency rule, or order would apply to
 
particular circumstances not yet determined." Id. at 197-98, 159
 
P.3d at 156-57. Because the purpose of HRS § 91-8 is to
 determine the "applicability" of a law, HRS § 91-8 may not be
 
used to review already-made agency decisions, for in such cases,
 
"the agency has already spoken as to the 'applicability' of the
 
relevant law to the factual circumstances at hand[.]" Id. at
 
197, 159 P.3d at 156. 
By requesting LUC to find that the Subdivisions 
approved by the County of Maui are harming traditional and customary rights as well as natural resources, Kuleana is 
attempting to use HRS 
§ 91-8 as a mechanism to require LUC to 
review the decisions of County of Maui. Review of another body's 
decisions is simply not a proper use of HRS § 91-8. "HRS § 91-8 
only allows for declaratory ruling as to questions of 
'applicability[.]'" Citizens Against Reckless Development
, 114 
Hawai'i at 200, 159 P.3d at 159. Any questions of the 
applicability of any law or rule, including constitutional questions, were answered when County of Maui approved the 
Subdivisions. 
Without the need for a district boundary amendment, the
 
jurisdiction to enforce use classification districts and their
 
restrictions resides with the counties under HRS § 205-12. 
Because County of Maui already approved the Subdivisions, and HRS
 
§ 91-8 is not an appropriate means of reviewing that decision,
 
LUC did not err in holding that it lacked jurisdiction over
 
Issues 3, 4, 6, and 7, and the circuit court properly affirmed
 
LUC's dismissal of these issues.
