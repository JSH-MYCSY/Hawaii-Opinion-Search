IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
CHARLES J. WAHLQUIST, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
EWA DIVISION
(HPD Traffic No. 1DTC-08-000024)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Charles J. Wahlquist (Wahlquist)
appeals from the judgment entered on June 24, 2008 in the
District Court of the First Circuit, Ewa Division (District
Court).1  Wahlquist was convicted of Excessive Speeding in
violation of HRS ยง291C-105(a)(1) and HRS ยง291C-105(a)(2).
On appeal, Wahlquist contends, inter alia , that the
District Court erred in overruling his objection that there was
insufficient foundation to admit testimony regarding the laser
speed gun reading.  Wahlquist argues that "there was insufficient
foundation to establish that this particular electronic measuring
device was: (1) properly maintained; (2) properly calibrated; and
(3) producing reliable speed readings."
Upon a careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted, and upon due consideration of the arguments made and
issues raised by the parties, we hold that the State failed to
adduce evidence that the laser gun was tested according to the
manufacturer's recommended procedures in order to establish
sufficient foundation to admit the laser gun reading.  State v.
Assaye, 121 Hawai #i 204, 210-14, 216 P.3d 1227, 1233-37 (2009). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2Other than the laser gun reading, no other evidence was presented
by the State to establish a speed to convict Wahlquist of
Excessive Speeding.  The State thus failed to meet its burden of
proof to convict Wahlquist of Excessive Speeding.
Given the above, we need not address the other points
of error raised by Wahlquist on appeal.
For the reasons set forth above, the District Court's
judgment entered on June 24, 2008 is reversed.
