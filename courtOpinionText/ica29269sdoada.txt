APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Greg Walter Schoenlein (Schoenlein)
appeals from the September 22, 2008 judgments of the Circuit
Court of the First Circuit (circuit court),1 convicting him of
Theft in the Second Degree, in violation of Hawaii Revised
Statutes (HRS) § 708-831(1)(b) (Supp. 2010), Attempted Escape in
the Second Degree, in violation of HRS §§ 710-1021 and 705-500
(1993), and Attempted Escape in the First Degree, in violation of
HRS §§ 710-1020 and 705-500 (1993).
In Appeal No. 29269, the appeal of the theft
conviction, Schoenlein argues that the circuit court erred by
violating his right to a speedy trial under Rule 48 of theNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2Upon careful review of the record and arguments
submitted, and having given due consideration to the arguments
advanced, the issues raised, and the relevant law, we conclude as
follows.
(1)  The circuit court did not err in denying
Schoenlein's motions to dismiss under HRPP Rule 48.   
HRPP Rule 48(b)(1) mandates the dismissal of a charge
unless trial is commenced within six months from the time of
arrest or the filing of the charges, whichever occurs first.  Six
months is "construed as one hundred eighty days."  State v.
Jackson, 81 Hawai# i 39, 50, 912 P.2d 71, 82 (1996).  Pursuant to
HRPP Rule 48(c), certain periods of delay are excluded from the
computation of the 180–day time limit.  Id.  To determine whether
dismissal is required under HRPP Rule 48, the start date and all
excludable periods must be identified.  State v. Diaz, 100
Hawai#i 210, 222, 58 P.3d 1257, 1269 (2002) (citation omitted). Hawai#i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP), the Interstate Agreement
on Detainers (IAD), as codified at HRS § 834-1 (1993), and the
U.S. and Hawai #i Constitutions.  In Appeal No. 29270, the appeal
of the attempted escape convictions, Schoenlein raises five
points of error:  (1) violation of speedy trial rights under the
HRPP and the state and federal Constitutions, (2) violation of
the IAD, (3) violation of HRPP Rule 9, (4) insufficient evidence,
and (5) cruel and unusual punishment.
The start of the trial clock on the theft charges began
on November 17, 2004, when Schoenlein was indicted.  The period
between the indictment on November 17, 2004 and the first trial
call on February 7, 2005, is included in the 180-day calculation. 
This amounts to eighty-two days, which were properly charged to
the prosecution.  The running of trial clock on the two attempted
escape charges began November 22, 2005 when Schoenlein was
indicted.  The time between the indictment and Schoenlein's
May 11, 2006 arrest was properly excluded under Rule 48(c)(5),
and the time between May 11, 2006 and July 10, 2006, the firstNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
3The time between the first trial calls held in both
cases and December 17, 2007 is excludable under HRPP Rule
48(c)(3).  The record reflects that during that time, the circuit
court met with the State attorneys and Schoenlein's public
defender for status conferences and repeatedly continued them.
This period is excludable from the calculation under Rule
48(c)(3), which covers "periods that delay the commencement of
trial and are caused by a continuance granted at the request or
with the consent of the defendant or defendant's counsel."  The
rescheduling of a pretrial status conference, a precondition to
the commencement of trial, delays the start of trial and is
therefore excludable.  Jackson, 81 Hawai #i at 52, 912 P.2d at 84.trial call on the attempted escape charges, a total of sixty
days, was appropriately charged to the prosecution.
Schoenlein complains on appeal that he did not agree to
the continuances.  However, there is no requirement that the
defendant himself must agree to the continuance, as Rule 48(c)(3)
"only requires consent from either the defendant or the
defendant's counsel."  Diaz, 100 Hawai# i at 223, 58 P.3d at 1270. 
Moreover, the circuit court found that "[a]t each of the status
conferences there's an agreement to continue to another status
conference[,]" a finding which is supported by the testimony of
the attorney who represented the State in the theft case.  The
circuit court's finding was not clearly erroneous and will not be
disturbed on appeal.  State v. Okumura, 78 Hawai# i 383, 392, 894
P.2d 80, 89 (1995).
The forty-two days between December 17, 2007, and
January 28, 2008, was excludable under Rule 48(c)(1), and the
remaining time before the June 4, 2008 commencement of trial was
excludable under subsection (c)(3).  At the December 17, 2007
trial call, Shoenlein's attorney stated that he would be filing a
motion to dismiss and the status conference was continued until
January 25, 2008.  Schoenlein filed a motion to dismiss on
January 24, 2008.  At the January 28, 2008 hearing on the motion,
Schoenlein's attorney moved to withdraw as counsel.  The timeNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
4needed to reset the case for trial following the appointment of
new counsel was attributable to the defendant and excludable
under Rule 48(c)(1) and (c)(3).  See State v. Cenido, 89 Hawai# i
331, 336, 973 P.2d 112, 117 (App. 1999) (defendant's oral motion
for continuance and defense counsel's motion to withdraw, and
periods of delay they created, were excludable).
Schoenlein argues that the State lacked diligence in
bringing him back to Hawai #i from Michigan, where he was
incarcerated, to stand trial.  Based on Schoenlein's citation to
State v. Jackson, 8 Haw. App. 624, 630, 817 P.2d 130, 134-35
(1991), we can infer that this argument relates to HRPP Rule
48(c)(5),2 which involves the "absence or unavailability of the
defendant[,]" another basis for excluding the time cited by the
circuit court.  While the record does not explain why 105 days
elapsed between the Department of the Attorney General's (DAG)
receipt of Schoenlein's request for "final disposition of all
untried indictments," the entire time that Schoenlein was in
Michigan was properly excluded under Rule 48(c)(3), as noted
above.  A given time period can only be excluded from computation
of speedy trial period once.  State v. Hoey, 77 Hawai# i 17, 31,
881 P.2d 504, 518 (1994).  Therefore, the circuit court did not,
for purposes of Rule 48, need to consider whether the State was
diligent in procuring Schoenlein's presence for trial.
Because of the continuances granted with defense
counsel's consent and the delays caused by motions filed by
Schoenlein, only ninety-eight days on the theft charge and 116
days on the attempted escaped charges had elapsed.  Accordingly,
Schoenlein was brought to trial within the 180 days allowed by
HRPP Rule 48.
(2)  The State did not violate the IAD.  The IAD, an
agreement between nearly every state, the federal government, and
2In State v. Jackson, this court held that "a defendant or
essential witness shall be considered unavailable whenever his whereabouts are
known but his presence for trial cannot be obtained by due diligence[.]"  8
Haw. App. 624, 630-631, 817 P.2d 130, 135 (1991) (quoting the Federal Speedy
Trial Act, 18 U.S.C.S. § 3161(h)(3)(b) (Law. Co-op. 1979)).NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
5the District of Columbia, provides a mechanism by which a member
state can secure the presence at trial of a prisoner incarcerated
within the jurisdiction of another compact member and by which a
prisoner may demand the speedy disposition of charges in a
jurisdiction other than the one where he is being held.  State v.
Batungbacal, 81 Hawai #i 123, 126, 913 P.2d 49, 52 (1996).
"The IAD is invoked only when a 'detainer' is initially
sent from a compact member having untried charges pending against
the prisoner to a compact member with custody over the prisoner."
Id. (alterations omitted).  "Quite simply, the IAD has no
applicability until a detainer comes into being."  State v.
Anderson, 939 N.E.2d 1317, 1321 (Ohio Ct. App. 2010) (citing
United States v. Mauro, 436 U.S. 340, 343 (1978)).  Because the
prosecuting attorney's office never lodged a detainer notifying
Michigan of the untried attempted escape charges, the IAD does
not apply in Appeal No. 29270.
In Appeal No. 29269, Schoenlein argued below that the
DAG violated the IAD by "willfully delaying the lodging of a
detainer" until June 1, 2007.  The IAD, however, puts no duty
upon a prosecutor to file a detainer.  Fex v. Michigan, 507 U.S.
43, 51 n.4 (1993); see also State v. Maddox, 195 P.3d 1254, 1262
(N.M. 2008); State v. Welker, 141 P.3d 8, 12 (Wash. 2006); People
v. Castoe, 150 Cal. Rptr. 237, 240 (Cal. Ct. App. 1978) ("The
lodging of a detainer . . . is discretionary with the district
attorney.").  Logically, a delay in filing a detainer, regardless
of length, cannot violate the IAD where the IAD does not require
that one be filed at all.  
Once a detainer is lodged, however, the IAD is
triggered and provides deadlines for bringing the incarcerated
accused to trial.  See Batungbacal, 81 Hawai #i at 127, 913 P.2d
at 53.  Although the circuit court never concluded whether IAD
Article III's 180-day deadline or Article IV's 120-day deadline
applied in this case, based on the record presented, we agree
with Schoenlein's position below that Article III applied.  There
was no evidence that the State requested temporary custody ofNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
6Schoenlein, but there was evidence that Schoenlein requested
disposition of the theft charge.  See HRS § 834-1, art. III and
IV.
On appeal, Schoenlein appears to argue the 180-day IAD
period should start at either July 13, 2007 or March 24, 2007; 
neither is correct.  The 180 days starts on delivery of the
notice to the prosecuting official and the circuit court.  
Batungbacal, 81 Hawai #i at 127, 913 P.2d at 53; see also Fex, 507
U.S. at 52.  The record reflects that the DAG and the circuit
court received Schoenlein's "Notice of Place of Imprisonment and
Request for Disposition of Indictments, Informations or
Complaints" and the required accompanying documents from the
Michigan prison warden on July 19, 2007.  The 180-day period
under the IAD, with no extensions given, would have begun July
19, 2007, and ended January 19, 2008.  See HRS § 834-1, Art.
III(a).
Like the HRPP, the IAD allows for the time-to-trial
clock to be tolled.
The 180-day period provided in article III(a) may be tolled
for three reasons:
(1) to allow the trial court to grant any necessary
and reasonable continuance for good cause shown in
open court with the defendant or his counsel present,
. . . [Article] III(a); (2) for as long as the
defendant is unable to stand trial, . . . [Article]
VI(a); or (3) for any period of delay in bringing the
defendant to trial caused by the defendant's request
or to accommodate the defendant.
State v. Schmidt, 84 Hawai #i 191, 197, 932 P.2d 328, 334 (App.
1997) (citations omitted, block format altered).  See also
Batungbacal, 81 Hawai #i at 130, 913 P.2d at 56 (construing the
phrase "unable to stand trial" in the tolling provision of
[A]rticle VI(a) of the IAD as including "all those periods of
delay occasioned by the defendant, including delays attributable
to motions filed on behalf of the defendant").
The circuit court found that Schoenlein's attorney made
an oral motion in chambers to continue the case until January 25,
2007 so that he could file a motion to dismiss; that this requestNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
7met the requirement for a "good cause" for which a continuance
could be granted; and that the "open court" requirement was
waived.  Schoenlein appears to object to this finding on appeal,
essentially arguing that in-chamber continuances cannot toll the
speedy-trial clock because they were not granted, as Article
III(a) requires, "for good cause shown in open court."  We do not
consider this proposition, because "periods of delay occasioned
by the defendant" also tolled the time-to-trial in this case. 
Schmidt, 84 Hawai# i at 196-97, 932 P.2d at 333-34.
The delay from December 17, 2007 to January 24, 2008,
came at the request of defense counsel.  Because the delay
resulted from Schoenlein's request, the period of delay will not
be held against the State.  Id.  The period between January 24,
2007 and February 5, 2008 is similarly tolled because it is a
"delay[] attributable to motions filed on behalf of the
defendant," specifically the January 24, 2008 motion to dismiss
and defense counsel's motion to withdraw.  Batungbacal, 81
Hawai#i at 130, 913 P.2d at 56.  The circuit court properly
excluded the time between the January 28, 2008 hearing on the
motion to dismiss and the February 25, 2008 status conference, at
which time the circuit court set a new trial date without
objection by Schoenlein or counsel.  Moreover, the time between
February 25, 2008 status conference and the new trial date was
excludable from the IAD calculation, notwithstanding that the new
trial date was well outside the 180-day IAD window.  See New York
v. Hill, 528 U.S. 110, 111, 118 (2000) (holding a defense
counsel's agreement to a trial date outside the 180 days required
by IAD Article III prevented defendant from seeking dismissal on
the grounds that the trial did not occur within that period).
At the time that Schoenlein pleaded guilty, at most 170
days--between July 19, 2007 and December 17, 2007--had run on the
IAD time-to-trial clock.  Accordingly, the IAD provides no basis
for reversing the theft conviction.
(3)  We reject Schoenlein's claims that he was denied
his constitutional rights to a speedy trial.  HRPP Rule 48 isNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
8"separate and distinct from [an accused's] constitutional
protection to a speedy trial" under the Sixth Amendment to the
U.S. Constitution and Article 1, § 14 of the Hawai #i
Constitution.  State v. Estencion, 63 Haw. 264, 268, 625 P.2d
1040, 1043 (1981).  However, where it has been determined that
the trial commenced within the six-month time period as defined
in HRPP Rule 48(b), the defendant "was not deprived of his
constitutional rights to due process or a speedy trial[.]"  State
v. Mundon, 121 Hawai #i 339, 362, 219 P.3d 1126, 1149 (2009). 
(4)  Schoenlein failed to establish that the circuit
court's conclusion that "[t]he warrant in this case was executed
without unnecessary delay and therefore, there is no violation of
HRPP Rule 9" was unreasonable.
HRPP Rule 9(c)(3)(i) requires a warrant to "be executed
without unnecessary delay by the arrest of the defendant."  In
determining whether "unnecessary delay" has occurred, the focus
is on whether the defendant was amenable to service of the
warrants during the period they were outstanding and whether
there was a reason for delay in serving the warrants.  State v.
Lei, 95 Hawai# i 278, 286, 21 P.3d 880, 888 (2001).
The circuit court's findings regarding the delay in
serving Schoenelein were supported by the testimony of a deputy
sheriff as well as his "record of attempts" made on the warrant.
(5)  There was sufficient evidence that Schoenlein
committed the offense of attempted escape and accordingly the
circuit court did not err in denying his motion for acquittal.  
The testimony of two adult corrections officers was presented to
prove that Schoenlein attempted to escape from Oahu Community
Correctional Center and from custody while at Queen's Medical
Center.  Schoenlein, on the contrary, claimed that he was trying
to commit suicide, not escape.  The circuit court found
Schoenlein guilty on both counts "based on all of the credible
evidence."  Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to
the prosecution and giving full deference to the circuit court's
right to determine credibility and to make reasonable inferencesNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
9of fact from the evidence, there was substantial evidence to
support the convictions.  See State v. Baxley, 102 Hawai #i 130
133, 73 P.3d 668, 671 (2003).,
(6)  Schoenlein's sentence on the attempted escape
charges did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.  The
following factors are considered in determining whether a
punishment is clearly and manifestly cruel and unusual:
(1) the nature of the offense and/or the offender, with
particular regard to the degree of danger posed by both to
society; (2) the extent of the challenged penalty as
compared to the punishments prescribed for more serious
crimes within the same jurisdiction; and (3) the extent of
the challenged penalty as compared to the punishment
prescribed for the same offense in other jurisdictions.
State v. Jenkins, 93 Hawai #i 87, 114, 997 P.2d 13, 40 (2000)
(citation omitted).
The circuit court based the sentence on the nature and
circumstance of the offense and the history and characteristics
of Schoenlein, satisfying the first factor, and there is no
evidence in the record nor argument presented that the sentence
imposed on Schoenlein was disproportionate when compared to the
sentences imposed for more serious offenses or imposed in other
jurisdictions for the same offense.
Therefore,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the judgments in Criminal
Nos. 04-1-2287 and 05-1-2431 of the Circuit Court of the First
Circuit, entered on September 22, 2008, are affirmed.
