NO. 29273
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
WELLS FARGO HOME MORTGAGE, INC., successor in
interest to The Prudential Home Mortgage Company, Inc.,
Plaintiff-Appellant, vs. U.S. FINANCIAL MORTGAGE CORP.,
Defendant-Appellee, and DOE DEFENDANTS 1 THROUGH 10, Defendants
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 04-1-1445)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, Inc.
 
(Wells Fargo) appeals from the Final Judgment of Dismissal
 
Without Prejudice entered on June 27, 2008 (Judgment), by the
 Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court),
1/ in favor of
 
Defendant-Appellee U.S. Financial Mortgage Corp. (U.S. Financial)
 
and against Wells Fargo. On appeal, Wells Fargo contends that
 
the Circuit Court erred in granting U.S. Financial's motion to
 
dismiss the case for want of prosecution for Wells Fargo's
 
failure to timely file a pretrial statement, which motion was
 
orally granted at an August 31, 2007 hearing. U.S. Financial did
 
not file an Answering Brief or otherwise respond to Wells Fargo's
 
appeal. 
1/
 The Honorable Karen S.S. Ahn presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Upon careful review of the record and the brief
 
submitted by Wells Fargo and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Wells
 
Fargo's contentions as follows:
 
It appears from the record that Wells Fargo did, in
 
fact, fail to timely file a pretrial statement. However, it also
 
appears, from the minutes of the Circuit Court's August 6, 2007
 
settlement conference, that the parties had reached an agreement
 
to submit the dispute to binding arbitration. The parties agreed
 
to use DPR's arbitration services, and further agreed to a
 
specific arbitrator and to split the costs of arbitration. 
Finally, it appears that the delays in this case were, at least
 
in substantial part, related to settlement efforts and a
 
stipulated removal of the dispute to federal court (although the
 
case was later remanded back to the Circuit Court). 
Based on our review of the record, we cannot conclude
 
that Wells Fargo or its counsel deliberately delayed prosecution
 
of the case or acted in a contumacious manner. See Bagalay v.
 
Lahaina Restoration Found., 60 Haw. 125, 132, 138-39, 588 P.2d
 416, 422, 425 (1978). Nor did U.S. Financial allege or appear to
 
suffer any prejudice from the delay. In light of the foregoing,
 
as well as the parties' agreement to submit the dispute to
 
binding arbitration, and the well-established policies in favor
 
of the enforcement of the agreement to arbitrate and the
 
resolution of disputes on their merits, the interests of justice
 
are not best served by dismissal of this case. As in Bagalay,
 
"we can understand the trial court's lack of patience with the
 
slow progress of this case," however, as the supreme court
 
concluded in that case, we conclude that the Circuit Court erred
 
in dismissing Wells Fargo's complaint. Id. at 138, 588 P.2d at
 
425.
 
Accordingly, we vacate the Circuit Court's June 27,
 
2008 Judgment and remand this case for the conduct of the binding

arbitration and such further proceedings as may be warranted
 
thereafter.
