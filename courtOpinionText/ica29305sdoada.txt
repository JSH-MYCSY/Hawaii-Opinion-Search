APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 03-1-1712)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Defendants/Counterclaim-Plaintiffs/Cross-Claim
 
Defendants/Appellants Glenn Nobuki Murakami and Ann Sue Isobe
 
(collectively, Appellants) appeal from the Final Judgment entered
 
by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court) on July
 
29, 2008.1
 
This appeal stems from the Circuit Court's confirmation
 
of an arbitration award in favor of Additional Counterclaim
 
Defendants, Cross-Claim Defendants And Cross-Claimants Michael
 
David Sakatani, Christine Marie Sakatani (Sakatanis) and 808
 
Development LLC's (808 Development) for unpaid construction work,
 
interest, fees, costs, and including a declaration that a
 
mortgage against Appellants' property is valid. Appellants
 
challenge the Circuit Court's July 29, 2008 order denying their: 
(1) motion to vacate and set aside the Arbitrator's (A) Interim
 
Arbitration Award, (B) Decision And Order Re: Post-Interim
 
Arbitration Award Motion, and (C) Final Arbitration Award; and
 
(2) motion for the appointment of a new arbitrator. Appellants
 
also challenge the Circuit Court's July 29, 2008 order confirming
 
the Arbitrator's Interim Arbitration Award and Final Arbitration
 
Award against them and in favor of the Sakatanis and 808
 
Development.
 
Appellants raise seven points of error, arguing that
 
the Arbitrator's awards were:
 
(1) Incomplete because the Arbitrator failed to decide
 
all of the issues that were expressly submitted to arbitration;
 
(2) The product of misconduct on the part of the
 
Arbitrator;
 
(3) Based on issues outside the scope of those
 
submitted to arbitration;
 
(4) Contrary to public policy;
 
1
 The Honorable Eden Elizabeth Hifo presided.
 
3  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(5) Contrary to the law of the case purportedly 
established a decision by the Hawai» i Supreme Court; 
(6) Mathematically erroneous; and
 
(7) Outside the scope of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 
2
ÿÿ 658A-21 (Supp. 2010).
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve
 
Appellants' contentions as follows:
 
(1) Appellants argue that the subject arbitration
 
award was incomplete because the Arbitrator failed to address
 
their claims for: (1) an accounting; (2) damages resulting from
 
the Sakatanis' alleged fraud, abandonment of the project, and
 
construction repairs, and (3) breach of contract damages. This
 
argument is without merit. It is evident from the record,
 
including the Arbitrator's summary of the parties' claims,
 
accounting testimony presented at the arbitration hearing, the
 
Interim Arbitration Award, and the Final Arbitration Award, that
 
the Arbitrator considered and rejected all of Appellants' claims
 
and arguments, including the ones identified on appeal.
 
(2) Appellants' contention of arbitrator misconduct is
 
without merit. Appellants fail to make any cogent arguments
 
supporting the requested relief; instead, Appellants state vague
 
allegations that the Arbitrator was "obvious[ly] confus[ed],"
 
that attorneys' fees and costs were awarded in an "inconsistent,
 
inattentive, and reckless manner," and a conclusory statement
 
that the Arbitrator failed to read the parties' submissions. 
Appellants failed to establish the grounds for vacating the
 
arbitration award under HRS ÿÿ 658A-23(a)(2)(C) (Supp. 2010).
 
2
 The Owners appear to introduce various additional arguments that
were not identified in their points of error. These arguments are deemed
waived. Hawai »i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4). 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(3) Appellants' third argument appears to invoke HRS 
ÿÿ 658A-23(a)(4) (Supp. 2010), which allows a court to vacate an 
award if the arbitrator exceeds his or her powers. Appellants' 
argument is, in fact, that the Arbitrator erred in entering the 
award in favor of the Sakatanis, as well as 808 Development. It 
is axiomatic that the review of arbitration awards must be 
"extremely narrow and exceedingly deferential." Tatibouet v. 
Ellsworth, 99 Hawai» i 226, 233, 54 P.3d 397, 404 (2002) 
(quotation marks and citations omitted). Such awards may only be 
vacated on statutory grounds, and not for errors of law or fact. 
Daiichi Hawaii Real Estate Corp. v. Lichter , 103 Hawai» i 325, 
336, 82 P.3d 411, 422 (2003) (citation omitted).  Accordingly, 
the Circuit Court did not err in rejecting Appellants' request to 
review the Arbitrator's factual and legal determinations. 
(4) Appellants' public policy argument is, in essence, 
that the Arbitrator failed to properly apply HRS ÿÿ 444-22. 
Even 
if the Arbitrator applied the law incorrectly, when parties agree to arbitrate, they "assume all the hazards of the arbitration 
process including the risk that the arbitrators may make mistakes 
in the application of law and in their findings of fact." 
Tatibouet v. Ellsworth , 99 Hawai» i 226, 233, 54 P.3d 397, 404 
(2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Where 
the arbitration award was made in good faith, as it apparently 
was in this case, Appellants are not "permitted to prove that the 
arbitrator[] decided wrong either as to the law or the facts of 
the case." Id.  at 236, 54 P.3d at 407. Thus, the Circuit Court 
did not err in rejecting Appellants' public policy argument. 
(5) Appellants argue that the Arbitrator's award
 
against them, which was based on 
quantum meruit, was contrary to
 
the "law of the case" purportedly established by the supreme
 court's affirmation of a prior judgment dismissing of 808
 
Development's mechanic's lien application against Appellants'
 
property. Again, by submitting this dispute to arbitration,
 
5   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Appellants assumed the hazards of the arbitration process 
including the risk that the Arbitrator could make a mistake of 
law, including an error in the applicability of a related 
mechanic's lien action. See, e.g., Daiichi Hawaii Real Estate 
Corp. v. Lichter, 103 Hawai» i 325, 336, 82 P.3d 411, 422 (2003). 
Thus, the Circuit Court did not err in declining to review the 
Arbitrator's award on this ground. 
(6) Appellants argue that the Arbitrator's award 
contained "mathematical miscalculations and arithmetic errors." 
See HRS ÿÿ 658A-24(a)(1) (Supp. 2010). 
Upon closer examination, 
however, Appellants' argument does not actually allege a 
mathematical miscalculation, but rather, argues that the award 
against Appellants is unsupported by the facts before the 
Arbitrator. Accordingly, this alleged point of error is 
unreviewable. Daiichi, 103 Hawai» i at 336, 82 P.3d at 422. 
(7) In their final point of error, Appellants allege 
that the Arbitrator failed to require proof of the Sakatanis' 
attorneys' fees and costs, and that said attorneys failed to 
proffer evidence of certain fees and costs and presented 
erroneous proof in other instances. 
Again, this alleged error is 
precisely the type of error that our courts have consistently refused to review, and therefore, this point is unreviewable.

XIV, LLC, 121 Hawai» i 110, 114-16, 214 P.3d 1100, 1104-06 (App. 
2009) (holding that the determination of the reasonableness of 
attorney's fees is clearly within the scope of an arbitrator's 
authority), 
affirmed , Kona Village Realty, Inc. v. Sunstone 
Realty Partners, XIV, LLC, 123 Hawai» i 476, 477, 236 P.2d 456,
