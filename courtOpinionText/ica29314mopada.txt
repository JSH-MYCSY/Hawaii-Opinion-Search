IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
JAMES WAYNE SHAMBLIN, aka STEVEN J. SOPER, Defendant-Appellant. 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NOS. 06-1-0507 and 07-1-0161)

 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
This appeal arises from two cases in the Circuit Court
 
1
of the Second Circuit (circuit court),  Criminal No. 06-1-0507
and Criminal No. 07-1-0161, that were consolidated below for
 
trial but for which separate judgments were issued. Each case
 
involved a number of charged offenses against Defendant-Appellant
 
James Wayne Shamblin (Shamblin). Shamblin appealed in each case
 
and the appeals were subsequently consolidated by order of this
 
court.
 
In Criminal No. 06-1-0507, Shamblin was charged with

 
five counts of burglary in the first degree in violation of
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 708-810(1)(c) (1993); one count
 
of unauthorized control of a propelled vehicle in violation of
 
HRS § 708-836 (Supp. 2010); one count of fraudulent use of
 
1 The Honorable Richard T. Bissen, Jr. presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
plates, tags or emblems in violation of HRS § 249-11 (Supp.
 
2010); one count of theft in the first degree in violation of
 
HRS § 708-830.5(1)(a) (1993 & Supp. 2010); two counts of theft of
 
a credit card in violation of HRS § 708-8102(1) (1993); two
 
counts of theft in the second degree in violation of HRS § 708­
831(1)(b) (Supp. 2010); and one count of theft in the fourth
 
degree in violation of HRS § 708-833(1) (1993).
 
In Criminal No. 07-1-0161, Shamblin was charged with
 
nine counts of burglary in the first degree; ten counts of theft
 
in the second degree; four counts of theft of a credit card; and
 
three counts of fraudulent use of a credit card in violation of
 
HRS § 708-8100(1)(a) (1993 & Supp. 2010).
 
Shamblin appeals from the judgments, both entered on 
July 22, 2008 by the circuit court, in Criminal No. 06-1-0507 and 
Criminal No. 07-1-0161, convicting him of all counts charged 
respectively in each case. Pursuant to a plea agreement with the 
State of Hawai 'i (State), Shamblin pled no contest to all counts 
charged in both cases. Prior to sentencing, he filed motions in each case to withdraw his no contest pleas. After briefing and a 
hearing, the circuit court denied Shamblin's motions to withdraw 
his no contest pleas and proceeded to sentencing. 
For each separate case, the sentences for the multiple
 
counts therein were ordered to run concurrently with each other,
 
with mandatory minimum terms imposed of six years and eight
 
months for all class B felonies and three years and four months
 
for all class C felonies. The circuit court further ordered, as
 
part of the judgment in Criminal No. 07-1-0161, that "all terms
 
of incarceration shall run concurrently with each other in this
 
case, and shall run CONSECUTIVELY to the term of imprisonment
 
ordered in CR. N. 06-1-0507(4)." 
On appeal, Shamblin raises three points of error:
 
(1) the circuit court abused its discretion in denying his pre­
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
sentence motions to withdraw the no contest pleas; (2) the
 
circuit court should have permitted him to withdraw his no
 
contest pleas due to ineffective assistance of trial counsel; and
 
(3) the circuit court erred in ordering that the mandatory
 
minimum terms run consecutively for Criminal No. 06-1-0507 and
 
Criminal No. 07-1-0161.
 
Based upon our careful review of the records in both
 
Criminal No. 06-1-0507 and Criminal No. 07-1-0161, our review of
 
the briefs submitted by the parties, and having given due
 
consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by
 
the parties, we vacate that part of the judgment in Criminal No.
 
07-1-0161 that requires the mandatory minimum terms in that case
 
to run consecutively with the mandatory minimum terms in Criminal
 
No. 06-1-0507. In all other respects, we affirm the judgments in
 
both cases.
 
I. Motions to Withdraw No Contest Pleas
 
A defendant does not have an absolute right to withdraw 
a plea, but in cases where a motion to withdraw a plea has been 
filed prior to sentencing, "the motion should be granted if the 
defendant has presented a fair and just reason for his request 
and the State has not relied upon the guilty plea to its 
substantial prejudice." State v. Jim, 58 Haw. 574, 576, 574 P.2d 
521, 523 (1978). "[T]he defendant has the burden of establishing plausible and legitimate grounds for withdrawal." State v. 
Merino, 81 Hawai
'i 198, 223, 915 P.2d 672, 697 (1996) (quoting 
State v. Costa, 64 Haw. 564, 565, 644 P.2d 1329, 1331 (1982)). 
The Hawai 'i Supreme Court has recognized "two 
fundamental bases of demonstrating 'fair and just reasons' for 
granting withdrawal of a plea: (1) the defendant did not 
knowingly, intelligently or voluntarily waive his or her rights; 
or (2) changed circumstances or new information justify 
withdrawal of the plea." State v. Gomes, 79 Hawai 'i 32, 37, 897 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
P.2d 959, 964 (1995). On appeal, the trial court's ruling is
 
reviewed for abuse of discretion. Id. at 36, 897 P.2d at 963.
 
A. Knowing, Intelligent, Voluntary Waiver of Rights
 Shamblin fails to establish that his pleas were not
 
entered knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently. At the change
 of plea hearing, the circuit court engaged in an appropriate
 
colloquy with Shamblin to ensure that he was knowingly,
 
intelligently, and voluntarily waiving his rights. Although
 
Shamblin takes issue with the circuit court's reference to
 
probation as a sentencing option if Shamblin changed his plea,
 
the circuit court was not bound by the plea agreement and
 
properly recited all possible sentencing options upon a change of
 
plea. That is, the circuit court's references to probation were
 
made in the context of explaining the full range of penalties
 
associated with the many counts charged in Shamblin's cases.
 
Shamblin also asserts, for the first time on appeal,
 
that his plea in Criminal No. 06-1-0507 was "defective because
 
two charges [counts 4 and 13] were omitted and then added back
 
in, after the plea was given and accepted." Shamblin further
 
argues that: "[b]ecause the Record does not clarify that [he]
 
understood the effect of this additional felony charge [i.e.,
 
count 4, burglary in the first degree], he should have been
 
permitted to withdraw his plea." Shamblin did not object to the
 
circuit court adding counts 4 and 13 to the plea form after
 
initially finding that Shamblin's pleas were knowingly,
 
intelligently, and voluntarily entered. When the circuit court
 
discovered the error in the plea form, the court asked if either
 
party wanted the court to go through the form again and
 
Shamblin's defense counsel replied "No, your Honor." Nor did
 
Shamblin raise the circuit court's addition of the two omitted
 
counts in Criminal No. 06-1-0507 as a basis for withdrawing his
 
no contest plea in his motion to withdraw the plea or during the
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
hearings on the motion. Accordingly, we review Shamblin's claim 
for plain error. See Hawai 'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) 
Rule 52(b); State v. Nguyen, 81 Hawai 'i 279, 292, 916 P.2d 689, 
702 (1996). An appellate court's "power to deal with plain error 
is a power to be exercised sparingly and with caution." Id. at 
293, 916 P.2d at 703 (citation omitted). 
The record reveals that the circuit court did engage in

 
a colloquy with Shamblin regarding counts 4 and 13:
 
[Court] Q. Let me just in particular Mr. Shamblin, in 06-1­
0507, in addition to counts 1, 7, 10 and 12,
there's also count 4, a burglary in the first
degree. Do you understand that also carries a
maximum term of ten years imprisonment and a
$25,000 fine?
[Shamblin] A. Yes, sir.
Q. This is, I guess, some kind of typographical

oversight. Counts [sic] 13 is a theft in
the fourth degree, a petty misdemeanor.
That carries the maximum penalty of 30 days
in jail and I [sic] $1,000 fine. Do you
understand that, sir?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. And again with respect to those counts, they
continue to come with the agreement that the State
will recommend ten years imprisonment for all
class B felonies, five years on all Class C
felonies with a six year, eight month on Class Bs
and three year four month on the Class Cs. Do you
understand that, sir?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. And then they are agreeing all of these
terms including the two terms we just
discussed, counts 4 and 13, could run
concurrently with the criminal number 07-1­0161. And again the State would not request
consecutive or extended sentencing. You'll
 agree to full restitution, joint and several
with Breeze Chrisler. And you'll agree to
pay $1,976 seized towards restitution. Is
 that all understood.
 
A. 
Yes, sir.

* * * *
 
The circuit court thus questioned Shamblin in open
 
court about counts 4 and 13, and also advised him of the maximum
 
penalties of each. The circuit court also had Shamblin write his
 
initials by these counts after they were added to the plea form
 
and before ultimately accepting his pleas and finding him guilty
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of all counts. We conclude that the circuit court sufficiently
 
met the requirements of HRPP Rule 11. 
Additionally, Shamblin's substantial rights were not
 
prejudiced by the circuit court's addition of counts 4 and 13 to
 
the plea form. At the time of the change of plea hearing,
 
Shamblin was aware that the State's Information and Complaint
 
against him included these counts and that he was required to
 
plead no contest to all counts in order to take advantage of the
 
State's plea offer. Moreover, both counts were part of Criminal
 
No. 06-1-0507 and at sentencing the circuit court ordered all
 
counts in Criminal No. 06-1-0507 to run concurrently. 
Accordingly, inclusion of counts 4 and 13 did not affect
 
sentencing. As Shamblin has failed to demonstrate that his
 
substantial rights were prejudiced, we decline to invoke the
 
plain error rule with regard to counts 4 and 13.
 
We also disagree with Shamblin's contention that he 
should have been allowed to withdraw his no contest pleas because 
they were made under duress; that is, after he was put in the 
position of agreeing to the State's plea offer or going to trial 
with an attorney, Cary Virtue (Virtue), whom Shamblin alleges was 
not prepared. Shamblin points to a hearing the day before he 
changed his plea wherein he indicated dissatisfaction with his 
defense counsel and the possibility of a continuance was 
discussed. The circuit court, noting that Shamblin had already 
had multiple defense counsel, stated it would not entertain a 
motion to continue trial, that trial would go forward as 
scheduled, and that Shamblin was either going to represent 
himself or have his defense counsel, Virtue, represent him. 
Shamblin's defense counsel confirmed to the circuit court that he 
was prepared to proceed with trial. Under these circumstances, 
the circuit court correctly relied on State v. Topasna, 94 
Hawai'i 444, 16 P.3d 849 (App. 2000) in noting that "a voluntary 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
choice between two extremely unpalatable alternatives, that is,
 
whether to plead guilty or go to trial and face a possibly higher
 
sentence, is still voluntary."
 
Shamblin also apparently argues that he did not make
 
his pleas knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily because
 
Virtue did not file pretrial motions that Shamblin had requested
 
be filed and had not located witnesses. We disagree. The record
 
establishes that Shamblin was fully aware, at the time he made
 
his pleas of no contest, that the pretrial motions had not been
 
filed and that the witnesses had not been found. Moreover, other
 
than the testimony of Breeze Chrisler (Chrisler), which we
 
address infra, Shamblin presented no evidence in support of his
 
motion to withdraw his pleas that witnesses had been located,
 
even though the hearing on his motion to withdraw was held nine
 
months after his pleas. Shamblin's arguments thus present no
 
plausible and legitimate grounds for withdrawal of his no contest
 
pleas.
 
B. Alleged New Information
 Shamblin argues that additional evidence became
 
available when his co-defendant Chrisler testified at the hearing
 on his motion to withdraw the pleas. Shamblin asserts that
 
Chrisler's testimony evidences that Shamblin may not have been
 
involved in all of the charged burglaries, that Chrisler was
 
responsible for the stolen credit cards and unauthorized charges,
 
that Chrisler is the one who drove the van at the time it was
 
stolen, and that other people used the van to "smoke ice" and
 
commit burglaries.
 
First, as to the stolen credit cards and unauthorized
 
charges, Chrisler's testimony at the hearing was not new
 
information that would justify withdrawal of Shamblin's pleas. 
Instead, Chrisler made these same admissions in her statement to
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
police, and the record reflects that Shamblin was aware of her
 
statement to police at the time he entered his no contest pleas.
 
Second, contrary to Shamblin's apparent assertion,
 
Chrisler did not testify that she alone committed any of the
 
charged burglaries. Although she testified generally that she
 
committed burglaries and "probably close to half of them were
 
committed with [Shamblin]," she also testified that she was on a
 
lot of drugs at the time and could not say which burglaries were
 
the ones for which she was charged. She also testified she could
 
not say who was with her for the burglaries with which she was
 
charged and did not know if she committed any of the charged
 
burglaries without Shamblin. Chrisler did, however, remember
 
committing multiple burglaries with Shamblin at Kapalua Bay
 
Villas and in Kihei.
 
Third, Shamblin points to Chrisler's testimony that she
 
was the one who drove the stolen van after obtaining the keys in
 
a burglary she committed with Shamblin. This seems of little
 
consequence, as Shamblin was charged in the alternative as a
 
principal or an accomplice. Moreover, Chrisler's testimony
 
provides evidence that Shamblin also drove the van at times after
 
it was stolen.
 
Finally, Shamblin relies on Chrisler's testimony that
 
other people sometimes used the van to commit burglaries and
 
smoke ice. Her testimony in this regard, however, provides no
 
information as to what property in the van, if any, may have been
 
from burglaries by unnamed others.
 
Overall, Chrisler's testimony further implicates
 
Shamblin in a number of the crimes charged. Moreover, while
 
Shamblin's actual guilt or innocence was not the issue in
 
addressing the motion to withdraw his pleas, the circuit court
 
properly considered whether the new information from Chrisler
 
would exculpate Shamblin if believed by a reasonable juror. 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Gomes, 79 Hawai 'i at 37, 39, 897 P.2d at 964, 966. Ultimately, 
these considerations go to the question of whether Shamblin has 
established "plausible and legitimate grounds" for withdrawal of 
his pleas. Similar to the holding in Jim, the circuit court 
might have granted the motion to withdraw the plea but it did not 
and "we are not prepared to find that the denial constituted a 
clear abuse of the [circuit] court's discretion." 58 Haw. at 
577, 574 P.2d at 523. 
II. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Claim
 
On appeal, Shamblin also asserts an ineffective
 
assistance of counsel claim, arguing that Virtue should have
 
filed a motion to suppress, properly investigated potential
 
defense witnesses, and informed Shamblin and the circuit court
 
that on the eve of the change of plea hearing Shamblin's brother
 
was purportedly in the process of hiring private counsel.
 
The Hawai 'i Supreme Court has made it clear that "[i]n 
any claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, the burden 
is upon the defendant to demonstrate that, in light of all the 
circumstances, counsel's performance was not objectively 
reasonable." Briones v. State, 74 Haw. 442, 462, 848 P.2d 966, 
976 (1993). Moreover, "matters presumably within the judgment of 
counsel, like trial strategy, will rarely be second-guessed by 
judicial hindsight." State v. Richie, 88 Hawai 'i 19, 39, 960 
P.2d 1227, 1247-48 (1998) (citations and internal quotation marks 
omitted) (emphasis in original). 
"Ineffective assistance of counsel claims based on the 
failure to obtain witnesses must be supported by affidavits or 
sworn statements describing the testimony of the proffered 
witnesses." Richie, 88 Hawai 'i at 39, 960 P.2d at 1247. 
(citation omitted). Shamblin did not provide affidavits or sworn statements detailing the substance of the allegedly exculpatory 
witnesses' testimony. He thus failed to establish his 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on Virtue's alleged
 
failure to investigate potential witnesses.
 
With regard to the motion to suppress, Virtue faced a 
situation where, if he filed any pre-trial motions, the State had 
made clear it would withdraw its plea offer, potentially 
subjecting Shamblin to extended and/or consecutive sentencing on 
the thirty-nine counts charged in the consolidated cases. 
Accordingly, Virtue had to weigh the merits of filing a 
suppression motion with the risk of losing the benefit of the 
State's plea offer. Based on Virtue's research that, under 
Hawai'i case law, a criminal defendant does not have an 
expectation of privacy in a vehicle that he does not own, Virtue made a tactical decision not to risk losing the benefit of the 
State's plea offer by filing a suppression motion that in his 
estimation was not likely to succeed. Virtue's decision not to 
file a motion to suppress was a strategic decision that should 
not be second-guessed on appeal. 
Finally, Shamblin alleges that Virtue failed to inform 
him and the circuit court that Shamblin's brother was purportedly 
in the process of hiring private counsel on the eve of the change 
of plea hearing. Virtue's testimony contradicts this claim, 
indicating that Shamblin was informed. Moreover, this argument 
is far too speculative as to how this alleged omission by Virtue 
"resulted in either the withdrawal or substantial impairment of a 
potentially meritorious defense." State v. Antone, 62 Haw. 346, 
348-49, 615 P.2d 101, 104; see also Int'l Sav. and Loan Ass'n v. Carbonel, 93 Hawai
'i 464, 473, 5 P.3d 454, 463 (App. 2000) ("An 
appellate court need not address matters as to which the appellant has failed to present a discernible argument."). 
Accordingly, this basis for Shamblin's ineffective assistance of 
counsel claim also fails. 
10

III. Consecutive Mandatory Minimum Terms for Criminal No.
06-1-0507 and Criminal No. 07-1-0161 
Shamblin argues that the circuit court erred in
 
ordering that the mandatory minimum terms in Criminal No. 
06-1-0507 and Criminal No. 07-1-0161 run consecutively. Shamblin
 
argues that such consecutive sentencing violates HRS § 706­
606.5(5) (1993 & Supp. 2010), the Repeat Offenders Statute. In
 
this regard, we agree.
 
The circuit court's sentence of Shamblin in each case
 
includes, inter alia, mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment of
 
six years, eight months on all class B felonies and three years,
 
four months on all class C felonies. See HRS § 706-606.5(1)(b)
 
(Supp. 2010). The sentences for convictions within each case
 
were ordered to run concurrently. However, finding inter alia
 
that Shamblin had an extensive record and demonstrated no
 
intention to change his behavior or comply with treatment or
 
supervision, the circuit court further ordered in Criminal No.
 
07-1-0161 that all terms of incarceration in that case run
 
consecutively with the terms of imprisonment in Criminal No. 
06-1-0507. The sentencing hearing was held simultaneously on
 
July 18, 2008 for both cases.2
 
Shamblin argues that the circuit court committed an
 
abuse of discretion in sentencing him to consecutive mandatory
 
minimum terms in the two cases because the cases were
 
consolidated and constituted "one" case for sentencing purposes.3
 
Shamblin further contends that, if they are considered separate
 cases, neither would be a "prior conviction" under HRS § 706­
2
 At the sentencing hearing, the circuit court specifically indicated
that "[t]he mandatory minimum terms will also run consecutive in each of the
-- one criminal number to the other."
 
3
 Shamblin's challenge is limited to the consecutive sentencing for
the mandatory minimum terms. No other part of the consecutive sentencing for
Criminal No. 06-1-0507 and Criminal No. 07-1-0161 is challenged on appeal.
 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
606.5(5) such that a sentencing court could order consecutive
 
sentencing of the mandatory minimum terms.
 
The State counters that "Shamblin's argument that the
 
cases were consolidated and treated as the same case is
 
incorrect. Separate records were maintained for each case. More
 
importantly, Shamblin himself provided two separate change of
 
plea forms . . . [and] filed two separate notices of appeal."
 
Given the express language of HRS § 706-606.5, we
 
conclude that the circuit court could not impose a mandatory
 
minimum term of imprisonment in Criminal No. 07-1-0161 to run
 
consecutive to the mandatory minimum term imposed in Criminal No.
 
06-1-0507 under the circumstances of this case. HRS § 706­
606.5(5) states in relevant part that "[t]he sentencing court may
 
impose the above sentences consecutive to any sentence imposed on
 
the defendant for a prior conviction, but such sentence shall be
 
imposed concurrent to the sentence imposed for the instant
 
conviction." (Emphasis added). Here, the circuit court imposed
 
the sentences in both cases on July 18, 2008, but did not enter
 
the judgment in Criminal No. 06-1-0507 until July 22, 2008. 
Therefore, no prior conviction had been entered in Criminal No.
 
06-1-0507 at the time the circuit court announced its sentence of
 
Shamblin in Criminal No. 07-1-0161. Under HRS § 706-606.5(7)(c)
 
(Supp. 2010), "[a] conviction occurs on the date judgment is
 
entered." Therefore, we conclude that the judgment in Criminal
 
No. 06-1-0507 entered on July 22, 2008 was not a "prior
 
conviction" for purposes of consecutive mandatory minimum terms
 
under HRS § 706-606.5. The circuit court abused its discretion
 
to the extent its judgment in Criminal No. 07-1-0161 ordered the
 
mandatory minimum terms in that case to run consecutively to the
 
mandatory minimum terms in Criminal No. 06-1-0507.
 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
IV. Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, we vacate that part of the
 
judgment in Criminal No. 07-1-0161 that requires the mandatory
 
minimum terms in that case to run consecutively with the
 
mandatory minimum terms in Criminal No. 06-1-0507, and we
 
remand for entry of an amended judgment in Criminal No. 07-1-0161
 
consistent with this opinion. In all other respects, we
 
affirm the judgments in both Criminal No. 06-1-0507 and Criminal
 
No. 07-1-0161.
