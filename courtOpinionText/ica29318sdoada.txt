HOWARD K. LESLIE, Claimant-Appellee, v.
KKL TRUCKING, INC., Employer-Appellee, Delinquent,
and SPECIAL COMPENSATION FUND, Appellee;
FREDERICK W. ROHLFING, III; FREDERICK W. ROHLFING, III,
A Limited Liability Law Company, Applicants-Appellants
 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
(CASE NO. AB 99-361 (2-99-00788))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Applicants-Appellants Frederick W. Rohlfing, III, and
 
Frederick W. Rohlfing, III, a Limited Liability Company
 
(Rohlfing) appeal from a July 18, 2008 order by the Labor and
 
Industrial Relations Appeals Board (Board) that granted
 
Rohlfing's request for attorneys' fees and costs in a reduced
 
total amount of $17,281.81, instead of the total requested amount
 
of $44,501.32, including attorneys' fees in the amount of
 
$39,202.86 and costs in the amount of $5,298.46 (Order).1
 
On appeal, Rohlfing contends that: (1) the Board erred
 
in reducing, without explanation, Rohlfing's request for
 
attorneys' fees and costs; and (2) Rohlfing's request for

attorneys' fees and costs is reasonable. No answering briefs
 
were filed.

 
Upon careful review of the record and the brief
 
submitted by Rohlfing, and having given due consideration to the
 
arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Rohlfing's
 

 contentions as follows:
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 386-94 (Supp. 2009)
 
provides, in relevant part:
 
ยง 386-94 Attorneys, physicians, other health care
providers, and other fees.  Claims for services shall not be
 
valid unless approved by the director or, if an appeal is
had, by the appellate board or court deciding the appeal.
Any claim so approved shall be a lien upon the compensation
in the manner and to the extent fixed by the director, the
appellate board, or the court.
In approving fee requests, the director, appeals
board, or court may consider factors such as the attorney's
skill and experience in state workers' compensation matters,
the amount of time and effort required by the complexity of
the case, the novelty and difficulty of issues involved, the
amount of fees awarded in similar cases, benefits obtained
for the claimant, and the hourly rate customarily awarded
attorneys possessing similar skills and experience. In all
 cases, reasonable attorney's fees shall be awarded.
 
Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR) ยง 12-47-55 provides:
 
ยง 12-47-55 Approval of attorney's fees.  Within ten
 
calendar days following the filing of a final decision and
order, or upon the filing of a stipulation and settlement
agreement with respect to an appeal compromised pursuant to
section 386-78, HRS, attorneys seeking approval of fees
pursuant to section 386-94, HRS, shall file with the board a
request for approval of attorney's fees setting forth the
various activities performed together with the time expended
by the attorney in each activity. The request shall be
served on those parties against whom the fees are to be
assessed. Any party objecting to approval of a request may
file a written objection thereto no later than ten calendar
days following service. No request for approval of
attorney's fees or agreement to pay attorney's fees shall be
valid until approved by the board.
 
 
Rohlfing timely filed a request for approval of
 
attorneys' fees and costs in the total amount of $44,501.32. No
 
party objected to the approval of the request. The Board
 
approved the request in the reduced amount of $17,281.81, without
 
explanation or allocation between fees and costs.
 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
It appears that the hourly rate requested by Rohlfing 
was within the range of the hourly rates allowed to other 
attorneys in this case and the total attorneys' fees request in 
the amount of $39,202.86 was not, on its face, unreasonable in 
light of, inter alia, the agreed-upon sum of $262,500.00 to be 
paid to the claimant from the Workers' Compensation Special 
Compensation Fund of the State of Hawai 'i, which sum was approved 
and ordered by the Board. 
As the record does not reflect the basis for the 
reduced award, we cannot effectively review whether the Board abused its discretion in awarding fees and/or costs as it did. 
Without such an explanation, we must vacate and remand the Order 
for clarification and/or a redetermination of the amount to be 
awarded to Rohlfing. See Hawaii Ventures, LLC v. Otaka, Inc., 
114 Hawai
'i 438, 498, 164 P.3d 696, 756 (2007); Price v. AIG 
Hawai'i Ins. Co., Inc., 107 Hawai 'i 106, 113, 111 P.3d 1, 8 
(2005). 
Accordingly, the Board's July 18, 2008 Order is vacated
 
and remanded.
