vehicle accident that occurred on February 8, 2000 in Honolulu,
 
Hawai'i (the 2000 accident), Plaintiff-Appellant/Cross-Appellee 
Marie Weite (Weite) appeals and Defendant-Appellee/Cross-
Appellant Matsuo Momohara (Momohara) cross-appeals from the
 Judgment filed on June 18, 2008, in the Circuit Court of the
 First Circuit (circuit court).

Five Hundred Thirty-Seven Dollars and Seventy-Three Cents
($6,537.73) representing the Covered Loss Deductible
pursuant to [Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)] § 431-10C-301.5,
shall be deducted.
 
Accordingly, it is hereby ordered, adjudged and
decreed that Judgment be and is hereby entered in favor of

 The Honorable Glenn J. Kim presided.
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal, Weite contends the circuit court erred in
 
(1) denying her "Motion for Partial Summary Judgment
 
on the Issues of Medical Necessity of Health Care and
 Reasonableness of Health Care Charges" (MPSJ Re Medical Bills),
 where Momohara had no medical expert testimony to refute
 causation of her medical treatment;
 
(2) denying her "Motion in Limine # 7 to (1) Exclude
 
Argument Regarding the Apportionment of [Weite's] Injuries to
 Preexisting Causes or Prior Accidents and (2) Exclude Any
 Reference to Prior Accidents" (MIL Re Prior Accidents) on the
 issue of apportionment and allowing argument on apportionment to
 go to the jury, where Momohara had no medical expert testimony
 refuting Weite's treating physicians' opinions that her injuries
 were 100% caused by the 2000 accident;
 
(3) refusing to permit Weite's expert witness and
 
treating physician, Robert Nierenberg, M.D. (Dr. Nierenberg), to
 provide his expert opinion as an independent medical examiner on
 the issue of apportionment;
 
(4) giving Hawai
'i Standard Civil Jury Instruction 
No. 7.3 (HCJI 7.3) on the issue of apportionment and refusing to give Weite's proposed Supplemental Jury Instruction No. 5 (Weite's proposed JI 5); 
(5) placing separate apportionment questions on the
 
special verdict form, which, in combination with the erroneous
 submission of the jury's instructions, created confusion and
 allowed the jury to apportion Weite's damages twice;
 
(6) calculating the judgment by apportioning the jury
 
award of special damages and general damages by 50% and then
 subtracting the full amount of the covered loss deductible (CLD); 
and
 
(7) failing to find that Weite was the "prevailing
 
party" for purposes of assessing Court Annexed Arbitration
 Program (CAAP) sanctions.
 
Weite also contends the circuit court abused its
 
discretion in not awarding her prejudgment interest, granting
 
2
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Momohara taxable costs as the "prevailing party," and denying her
 
taxable costs as the "non-prevailing party."
 
Weite requests that we reverse the Judgment; vacate the
 
portion of the jury verdict apportioning her damages; declare her
 the prevailing party entitled to CAAP sanctions, costs, and
 attorney's fees; remand this case for re-calculation of the
 judgment amount and prejudgment interest; and/or remand this case
 for a new trial.
 
On cross-appeal, Momohara contends the circuit court
 
erred in 
(1) denying his "Motion in Limine No. 3 to Limit
 
and/or Exclude [Weite's] Claims for Medical Expenses" (MIL Re
 Medical Claims), where the circuit court should have limited
 Weite's claimed medical expenses in amount and frequency to those
 permitted under the workers' compensation fee schedule, pursuant
 to HRS § 431:10C-308.5(b) (Supp. 1999), and prohibited Weite from
 introducing evidence of medical expenses beyond that limit; and
 
(2) permitting Dr. Nierenberg to testify regarding the
 
amounts, reasonableness, and necessity of Weite's medical
 expenses incurred at Queen's Medical Center (QMC), Radiology
 Associates (RA), and Orthopedic Rehabilitation Specialists (ORS).
 
Momohara asks that we vacate the jury's award of
 
special medical damages to Weite in excess of the amount
 permitted under HRS § 431:10C-308.5(b) and medical expenses to
 Weite from QMC, RA, and ORS and remand this case for re­calculation of the appropriate judgment amount. Momohara also
 states that the judgment should reflect Weite's $1,000 automobile
 insurance deductible, as apportioned by the jury.
I.
 
The 2000 accident occurred when Weite's car was struck
 
by a car driven by Momohara. It is undisputed that Momohara
 negligently caused the accident.

treated by Dr. Nierenberg and Dennis B. Lind, M.D. (Dr. Lind), a

 On August 9, 2007, the parties filed a Stipulation and Order
Regarding Liability and Consent, in which Momohara admitted he was negligent

psychiatrist, and underwent physical therapy with ORS for
 
injuries she claimed resulted from the 2000 accident.
A.	 PRETRIAL
 1. 	Settlement negotiations with A.I.G. Hawaii
Insurance Company (AIG)
 
On November 2, 2004, Weite sent a demand letter with
 
copies of her medical records to AIG, Momohara's automobile
 
insurance carrier. Weite and AIG entered into settlement
 negotiations. While negotiations were ongoing, Weite filed her
 First Amended Complaint. AIG then withdrew its settlement offer.
 
2.	 First Amended Complaint
 
Weite filed a First Amended Complaint on February 3,
 
2006, alleging that while operating his motor vehicle on or about
 February 8, 2000, Momohara had committed a "breach of duty,
 negligence, and/or other wrongful acts or omissions" that legally
 caused her physical injuries and other damages. Weite sought
 special and general damages, pre- and post-judgment interest, and
 costs.
 
3.	 CAAP arbitration
 
Weite and Momohara entered into a CAAP arbitration, and
 
the arbitrator issued an Arbitration Award on November 9, 2006. 
The arbitrator awarded Weite $7,808.62 in special damages,
 $20,000 in general damages, and $299.50 in costs. The award
 provided that pursuant to HRS § 431:10C-301.5 (2005 Repl.), the
 "[t]otal damages shall be reduced by a CLD in the amount of
 [$]6,808.62." On November 17, 2006, Momohara filed an appeal
 from the Arbitration Award and a request for trial de novo to the
 circuit court.
 
4.	 Offer from Momohara
 
On February 28, 2007, Momohara offered Weite $5,000 in 
general damages, net of the CLD, to settle Weite's claims. On March 16, 2007, Momohara proffered a Hawai
'i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) Rule 68 Offer of Settlement in the amount of $10,000 in general damages, net of the CLD, to settle Weite's claims.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
5. Stipulation
 
On July 16, 2007, the parties filed a "Stipulation that
 
[Weite] Has Met an Exception to the Abolition of Tort Liability
 
Pursuant to HRS § 431:10C-306(b)(4)" by incurring personal injury
 protection (PIP) benefits equal to or in excess of $5,000.
6. Sanction
 
On October 4, 2007, Momohara filed his First
 
Supplemental Final Naming of Witnesses (Naming of Witnesses),
 adding Pat Oda (Oda), whom Momohara had not previously identified
 in his August 21, 2007 Final Naming of Witnesses. On October 17,
 2007, Weite filed a "Motion to Strike Pat Oda from [Momohara's]
 First Supplemental Final Naming of Witnesses, Filed October 4,
 2007, and Preclude Video from Trial" (Motion to Strike
 Oda/Preclude Video), in which she moved to strike Oda as a trial
 witness and preclude from trial a video of Weite taken after the
 2000 accident because Momohara had not named Oda or provided
 Weite with a copy of the video until after the discovery cut-off
 date. After a hearing, the circuit court filed a November 7,
 2007 order, in which the court treated the motion as a motion for
 sanctions and sanctioned Momohara for the discovery violations,
 but declined to strike Oda as a witness or preclude the video
 from trial.
 
7. MPSJ Re Medical Bills
 
On August 24, 2007, Weite filed her MPSJ Re Medical
 
Bills, in which she moved the circuit court for an order granting
 partial summary judgment in her favor and finding (1) as a matter
 of law that all of her health care for injuries sustained in the
 2000 accident was reasonable and necessary, (2) she had incurred
 $8,963.90 in reasonable and appropriate health care charges and a
 $1,000 automobile insurance deductible (deductible), and (3) the
 $7,936.06 in medical expenses paid by Island Insurance Company,
 Ltd., her automobile insurer, (PIP provider) were reasonable and
 necessary.
 
On October 9, 2007, Momohara filed a memorandum and
 
supplemental memorandum in opposition. In his opposition,
 Momohara pointed to Weite's deposition testimony wherein she
 
5
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
admitted that from the time of her 1988 accident, she continued
 
to have intermittent and periodic pain in her neck and back,
 including as of the time of the 2000 accident. The circuit court
 held a hearing on the MPSJ Re Medical Bills on October 16, 2007. 
The circuit court orally denied the motion, stating:
 
I don't know how strong [Momohara's] case is going to be. 
 I
 
don't know whether [Momohara is] going to be able to
convince the jury, but, as I see it there is still a genuine
issue of material fact. The jury is specifically
instructed, for example, that they don't have to believe
anything the experts say.
 
On October 22, 2007, the circuit court filed an order denying the
 
MPSJ Re Medical Bills.
 
9. Weite's MIL Re Prior Accidents
 
On April 21, 2008, Weite filed her MIL Re Prior
 
Accidents, in which she moved
 
for an order excluding any argument regarding the need for
an apportionment of [Weite's] injuries to preexisting causes
or prior accidents and to exclude any reference to prior
accidents. [Weite's] treating physicians attribute 100% of
[Weite's] treatment to the [2000 accident]. [Momohara] has
not retained any expert witnesses to dispute this testimony
and has not even deposed the treating physicians. At this
 juncture, there is no competent evidence that can serve as
the basis for an apportionment. It is likely that
[Momohara's] counsel will comment in opening statement about
prior accidents that [Weite] was involved in. Such
 comments, unsupported by any evidence that [Weite's]
injuries overlapped and require an apportionment, are
irrelevant and/or unduly prejudicial. Further, references
to prior accidents appear in [Weite's] medical records.
[Weite] has prepared a redacted set of medical records to
remove these references.
 
On April 25, 2008, Momohara filed a memorandum in opposition, in
 
which he argued there was evidence that Weite had symptoms from
 preexisting injuries at the time of the 2000 accident; Weite had
 the burden of proving her case, including causation; Momohara had
 the right to cross-examine Weite's expert witness regarding the
 basis of his opinions; and Momohara did not have to present his
 own witnesses to rebut Weite's expert testimony. On April 29,
 2008, Weite filed a reply. The circuit court held a hearing on
 the motions in limine on May 2, 2008, at which the court orally
 denied the MIL Re Prior Accidents, stating that "in the Court's
 view this is for the jury." The circuit court further stated
 
6
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
that if after Momohara presented his case there was insufficient
 
evidence for apportionment to go to the jury, the court would
 rule accordingly.
9. Momohara's MIL Re Medical Claims
 
On April 21, 2008, Momohara filed his MIL Re Medical
 
Claims, in which he sought an order (1) limiting Weite's claim
 for past medical expenses to $7,808.62 and (2) excluding any and
 all claims by Weite for future medical treatment and related
 expenses. Momohara alleged that in response to an interrogatory,
 Weite stated she had incurred medical expenses stemming from the
 2000 accident totaling $7,808.62, which represented a $1,000
 deductible she had paid and $6,808.62 in payments made by her PIP
 provider. Weite had not indicated that she incurred any expenses
 in excess of $7,808.62. Momohara maintained that Weite had not
 exhausted the amount of medical insurance benefits available to
 her and should be precluded from asserting any claims for future
 medical treatment or related expenses.
 
On April 25, 2008, Weite filed a memorandum in 
opposition, in which she stated that her PIP payments totaled $7,872.34: the $1,000 deductible she had paid and $6,872.34 her PIP provider had paid. She argued she was entitled to the "reasonable value" of her medical expenses, or $8,556.63, pursuant to Bynum v. Magno, 106 Hawai
'i 81, 86-87 & 92, 101 P.3d 
1149, 1154-55 & 1160 (2004), and was not limited to the amount paid by her PIP provider. 
After the hearing, the circuit court filed an order on
 
May 14, 2008 denying the motion.
B. TRIAL
 
1. Weite's testimony
 
Weite testified that in 1981 while working at Sears,
 
she lifted a carpet and ruptured a disk at the L4-5 level in her
 back (1981 injury). She stated that at some point, the herniated
 

disc resolved3 itself and was no longer an issue for her, but the
3
 Weite testified that by "resolved" she meant "gone away
substantially" and if she felt only occasional pain from an injury, she
considered the condition to be resolved.
 
7
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
herniation "never went away." Weite continued to have low back
 
pain stemming from the lifting incident from 1981 through 1984. 
She experienced a recurrence of the back pain in 1984 such that
 she needed bed rest for one week. In 1988, Weite injured her
 neck and back in a car accident (the 1988 accident). She
 testified that at some point, her injuries from the 1988 accident
 were "essentially resolved," but there were occasions when her
 lower back would hurt when she "overexerted or did something." 
She was still having symptoms from injuries resulting from the
 1988 accident in 1989, was still having pain in her back and
 right leg in 1992, and had occasional flare ups of back pain
 prior to 1994.
 
In 1994, Weite was knocked unconscious; broke her arm;
 
and cut her arms, legs, and chin in a car accident (the 1994
 accident). She had pain in her ribs, neck, and back from that
 accident. In 1995, Weite injured her neck and back in another
 car accident (the 1995 accident). She testified that at some
 point before the 1995 accident, the injuries from the 1994
 accident resolved themselves. She stated that a few years after
 the 1995 accident, her injuries from that accident were resolved,
 but she later testified that in 1998 she was still having neck
 and back problems stemming from the 1995 accident.
 
Prior to the 2000 accident, Weite had not seen
 
Dr. Nierenberg for about a year. She testified that at her last
 visit to the doctor in 1999, "she might have had some pain but it
 wasn't major pain" and she had complained that she was having
 difficulty sleeping due to lower back and neck pain. The
 doctor's notes indicated that the pain was an "auto accident
 flareup."
 
Weite testified that sometime between 1999 and the 2000
 
accident, she occasionally had neck or back pain, but did not
 need treatment for it and had not had physical therapy.
 Occasionally, her neck pain would "flare up." When asked whether
 the 2000 accident aggravated her existing back condition, Weite
 testified, "Well, I know I have a . . . herniated disk and so I
 have that condition. So, yeah, to some extent I have this
 
8
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
condition and I have an accident and it makes it hurt. So in
 
that regard, yes." On cross-examination, Momohara's counsel
 asked Weite: "Isn't it correct that from 1988, perhaps even from
 1981 with that herniated disk in your back, from that time on you
 never got to the point where you were totally pain-free and you
 never had neck pain, you always had flareups which occurred
 occasionally?" Weite responded, "Yes." Weite acknowledged that
 when asked by Momohara's counsel in her deposition whether
 Dr. Nierenberg told her she would never return to her pre-injury
 status after the 1988 accident, she replied that he had done so.
 
Weite had never been treated by a psychiatrist or
 
diagnosed with a driving phobia prior to the 2000 accident.
2. Dr. Nierenberg's testimony
 
Dr. Nierenberg testified that he was a physician, had 
earned his medical degree from UCLA Medical School, and had completed his residency at the University of Hawai
'i. In Hawai 'i, 
he had been an emergency room physician for five years and then specialized in sports medicine, which he currently practiced and had practiced for the past twenty-seven years. He was licensed in Hawai
'i, California, and Utah. He had authored articles, 
including one on standards for independent medical examinations (IMEs), that was published by the American Medical Association. He was a board-certified independent medical examiner, which required special training, and he had performed over two thousand IMEs. He had been deposed as an expert witness maybe one or two hundred times and had testified in court as an expert over ten times. He was on the advisory board of the American Board of Independent Medical Examiners and the president of the Academy of Independent Medical Examiners of Hawai
'i. 
Addressing the circuit court, Weite's counsel offered
 
Dr. Nierenberg as an expert in the fields of general medicine,
 sports medicine, and IMEs. Momohara's counsel objected to the
 circuit court's qualifying the doctor as an expert in IMEs on the
 ground that IMEs were not relevant to this case. The court
 qualified Dr. Nierenberg in all three fields over Momohara's
 counsel's objection. At a bench conference, Momohara's counsel
 
9
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
objected to questioning the doctor regarding IMEs. Weite's
 
counsel responded that Dr. Nierenberg would not testify that he
 had conducted an IME of Weite, but he would testify about
 apportionment of damages from the perspective of someone who
 specialized in IMEs. Weite's counsel stated that the doctor's
 training in and practice of IMEs gave him a unique and
 particularly helpful insight into apportionment. The circuit
 court stated that it would not allow Dr. Nierenberg to testify
 regarding apportionment: "I'm not going to allow that. I'm not
 going to allow him to start talking about apportionment . . . .
 He can . . . [l]ink all the injuries to one accident. He's
 perfectly capable [and] qualified to testify to that. That's as
 far as I'm going to allow it."
 
Dr. Nierenberg testified that he had known Weite for
 
approximately twenty-three years. She had been a patient at his
 clinic since the early 1980s, when she had been treated by
 another doctor. Dr. Nierenberg assumed her care in 1984 or 1985.
 
On February 9, 2000 (2/9/00), Dr. Nierenberg examined 
Weite in connection with the injuries she received in the 2000
 accident. He diagnosed her injuries and prescribed her
 medication and physical therapy. Because he was "well aware of
 the fact she's had previous accidents," he "asked her how she was
 doing before the [2000] accident." Weite said "she was doing
 well." Dr. Nierenberg testified that Weite had "been involved in
 some previous automobile accidents and she had been doing quite
 well both physically and mentally before the 2000 accident but
 she said that she was having a . . . rather paralyzing type of
 anxiety in some cases about driving. She was fearful of being
 injured again."
 
Dr. Nierenberg testified that in 1981, another doctor
 
at the clinic had treated Weite for a probable herniated disk as
 a result of the 1981 injury. Dr. Nierenberg had treated Weite
 for injuries she sustained in the 1988, 1994, and 1995 accidents
4
 
(collectively, the prior accidents). 
4
 Weite was initially seen at the clinic by Dr. Seaberg for the 1995
accident.
 
10
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
During a recess, Weite's counsel asked the circuit
 
court to permit Dr. Nierenberg to testify about "his experience
 
as a medical examiner and how it relates to issues of
 apportionment." Weite's counsel argued that Dr. Nierenberg was
 well-versed in standards of apportionment because he had "done it
 several thousand times." The circuit court asked Weite's counsel
 if he was "going to lay some foundation about that
 [Dr. Nierenberg] deals with these issues in his practice and then
 you're going to ask [the doctor] for an ultimate answer in this
 case, right?" Weite's counsel answered, "Correct which the law
 permits." The circuit court ruled that it would allow
 Dr. Nierenberg to testify as a treating physician that in his
 medical opinion Weite's injuries in this case could all be
 attributed to the 2000 accident because her prior injuries had
 resolved themselves by the time of 2000 accident. However, the
 circuit court would not allow Dr. Nierenberg to testify about the
 law of apportionment or how the jury should decide apportionment
 because he was not the independent medical examiner in the case.
 

Dr. Nierenberg5 testified that the medical charges to
Weite from him, QM, RA, and ORS stemming from the 2000 accident were reasonable and necessary and were within the range commonly charged by other providers in Hawai
'i at the time he treated 
Weite for her injuries stemming from the 2000 accident. 
Dr. Nierenberg stated that all of Weite's injuries he

 
treated after February 8, 2000 were related to the 2000 accident
 and absolutely no other accident had contributed to those
 injuries.
 
On cross-examination, Dr. Nierenberg testified that one
 
month prior to the 1988 accident, Weite was still suffering from
 back pain related to the 1981 injury. After the 1988 accident,
 Weite saw Dr. Nierenberg for neck pain, back strain, and tingling
 in her fingers. He stated that, in general, someone with neck
 pain who complained of tingling could have a neurologic injury. 
5
 Dr. Nierenberg testified that his charges were "[v]ery reasonable"
and, in fact, were lower than what other similar providers would have charged
for the treatments.
 
11
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Weite's lower back was more sore than it had been previously. 
Dr. Nierenberg continued to treat Weite through 1991, and his
 prognosis was that she would "continue to have mild to moderate
 back pain for the foreseeable future with occasional flare ups
 which will require increased medication and physical therapy."
 
In the 1994 accident, Weite sustained injuries to her
 
neck and back. She was still receiving treatment for neck and
 back pain when she was injured in the 1995 accident.
 Dr. Nierenberg testified that Weite complained of neck, back, and
 leg pain and stiffness for three years after the 1995 accident. 
She also had disc protrusions in her neck in 1998. In 1999,
 Weite was still suffering neck and back pain resulting from the
 1994 accident. Dr. Nierenberg stated that Weite had occasional
 flare ups, but in 1999, she had had only one. When Weite saw
 Dr. Nierenberg for treatment related to the 2000 accident, she
 said she was still experiencing occasional aches.
 
Dr. Nierenberg testified that if Weite had a "flare up"
 
tomorrow, it would be a result of the 2000 accident. He came to
 this conclusion based on the fact that Weite had not visited a
 physician, requested pain medication, or complained of pain just
 prior to the 2000 accident.
 
Momohara's counsel engaged Dr. Nierenberg in the
 
following line of questioning:
 
Q. [Momohara's counsel] So, in light of her
treatment history, in light of her accident history, in
light of her periodic flare ups, in light of the fact that
she was telling you that she still had occasional aches,
isn't it correct that she had not fully recovered from the
prior accidents at the time of the 2000 accident because she
still had occasional aches?
 
A. [Dr. Nierenberg] Pretty long question. What do
 
you mean by fully?
 
Q. Well, I'm asking you didn't she still have some
residual symptoms from those prior accidents at the time she
came in to see you on February 9th?
. . . .
 
Q. I'm asking you whether or not she told you she
still had aches.
 
A. Yes. We went over that before she still had aches
 
not had aches with a full recovery it's the lack of a full
recovery. [Sic]
 
12
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
When asked on redirect examination if Weite would have
 
had any of the symptoms or needed any of the treatments she
 
received after the 2000 accident had the 2000 accident not
 occurred, Dr. Nierenberg testified that "[i]t's possible she may
 have had one or two treatments that would be similar but in total
 she wouldn't have needed all of that" and "she may have needed
 some medication, physical therapy . . ., but certainly not the
 amount and frequency and duration."
3.	 Motions for judgment as a matter of law
(JMOL)
 
At the close of Weite's case, Weite moved for JMOL
 
regarding apportionment. Weite's counsel maintained there was no
 
genuine issue of material fact regarding whether damages should
 be apportioned because Momohara had not presented any expert
 testimony to that effect and Weite's experts did not concede that
 apportionment was warranted. Momohara's counsel countered that
 Weite's testimony that she had occasional pain and Dr.
 Nierenberg's testimony that Weite had occasional aches sufficed
 to present a genuine issue of material fact. The circuit court
 denied the JMOL motion. At the close of Momohara's case, Weite's
 counsel renewed his motion for JMOL, which the circuit court
 again denied.
 
4.	 Jury instructions
 
On April 21, 2008, Momohara filed his proposed jury
 
instructions, in which he requested that the circuit court give
 HCJI 7.3 on pre-existing injury or condition. The instruction
 provided in part: "If you find that plaintff(s) was/were not
 fully recovered and that the pre-existing injury or condition was
 not latent at the time of the subject incident, you should make
 an apportionment of damages[.]"
 
Also on April 21, 2008, Weite filed her proposed JI 5,
 
which provided: "Generally, a defendant is liable in damages to
 a plaintiff for all injuries legally caused by the defendant's
 negligence, including damages resulting from the aggravation of
 the victim's pre-existing disease, condition, or predisposition
 to injury."
 
13
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
During the settling of jury instructions on May 13,
 
2008, Weite's counsel objected to proposed HCJI 7.3, stating that
 
he did not believe Momohara's counsel had laid out a prima facie
 case to warrant giving the instruction on the issue of
 apportionment: 
They've adduced no facts. Simply relied on cross
examination. None of the doctors who testified in this case
 agreed that apportionment is appropriate. They all stated
their opinions to reasonable medical probability. No
 rebuttal by any medical witness. No witness in fact
 proffered by the defense . . . . Lacking foundation.
 
The second thing we believe this is an incomplete
statement and also confusing. 
Momohara's counsel argued that medical testimony was not the only
 
admissible evidence regarding apportionment. The circuit court
 stated that it would give the jury a modified version of the
 instruction.
 
At trial, the circuit court gave the jury a modified
 
version of HCJI 7.3.
 
On a special verdict form, the jury awarded Weite 
$8,556.63 in special damages and $30,700.00 in general damages
 "[w]ithout regard to any possible apportionment of her damages." 
The jury attributed 50% of Weite's injuries to the 2000 accident.
C. POST-TRIAL
 
1. Motion for JMOL/New Trial
 
On May 23, 2008, Weite filed a "Motion for Judgment as
 
a Matter of Law and in the Alternative Motion for a New Trial"
 (Motion for JMOL/New Trial). Weite argued that the circuit court
 had erred by (1) permitting the issue of apportionment to go to
 the jury without any expert medical testimony in support of
 apportionment and (2) precluding Dr. Nierenberg from testifying
 on the issue of apportionment, in light of his training and
 experience as an independent medical examiner. 
Momohara filed an opposition memorandum, in which he
 
argued that Weite was not entitled to JMOL because the jury
 verdict was consistent with the overwhelming evidence presented
 at trial supporting apportionment of Weite's damages and there
 was no basis for the circuit court to grant Weite a new trial as
 she had not been substantially prejudiced by Dr. Nierenberg's
 
14
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
failure to testify regarding apportionment. Weite filed a reply
 
memorandum. 
The circuit court held a hearing on the motion on
 
June 17, 2008, at which the parties presented their arguments. 
On June 24, 2008, the circuit court filed an order denying the
 motion.
 
2.	 Weite's Motion for CAAP Sanctions,
Taxation of Costs, and Pre- and Post-
judgment Interest Against Momohara, and
Momohara's Motion to Apply the CLD to
the Jury Verdict
 
On May 23, 2008, Weite filed a "Motion for CAAP
 
Sanctions, Taxation of Costs, Prejudgment Interest, and Post-
Judgment Interest Against [Momohara]" (Motion Re Sanctions/Costs/
 Interest). Weite contended she was entitled to prejudgment
 interest from the date of the 2000 accident to the time the
 motion was filed. Weite argued that Momohara had acted in bad
 faith during settlement negotiations, forcing the case to trial;
 repeatedly conducted discovery after the discovery cutoff date;
 and refused to depose Weite's medical experts or stipulate to the
 reasonableness of Weite's medical treatment and bills, forcing
 Weite to litigate that issue. With regard to her request for CAAP
 sanctions against Momohara, Weite claimed Momohara was subject to
 

sanctions pursuant to Hawaii Arbitration Rules (HAR) 256 and
6
 HAR 25 provides:
 
Rule 25. THE PREVAILING PARTY IN THE TRIAL DE NOVO; COSTS.
 
(A) The "Prevailing Party" in a trial de novo is the party
who (1) appealed and improved upon the arbitration award by 30% or
more, or (2) did not appeal and the appealing party failed to
improve upon the arbitration award by 30% or more. For the
 purpose of this rule, "improve" or "improved" means to increase
the award for a plaintiff or to decrease the award for the
defendant.
 
(B) The "Prevailing Party" under these rules, as defined
above, is deemed the prevailing party under any statute or rule of
court. As such, the prevailing party is entitled to costs of
trial and all other remedies as provided by law, unless the Court
otherwise directs.

26,
because as the appealing party from CAAP arbitration, Momohara
 had not fulfilled his obligation to improve the CAAP award by 30%
 at trial. Weite illustrated the difference between the CAAP
 award and the judgment amount as follows:
 
CAAP award total: $27,808.62 
Award less 30%: $19,466.03 
Trial Verdict: $39,256.63 
Judgment (less 50%
apportionment): $19,628.32 
(Footnotes omitted.) Weite argued that "Momohara needed to
 
reduce the verdict to $19,466.03 or less" to avoid incurring
 sanctions. In a footnote, Weite indicated that pursuant to HRS
 § 431:10C-301.5, a CLD of $6,808.62 was not to be deducted until
 after the CAAP award total was reduced by 30%. Weite maintained
 she was entitled to post-judgment interest until the judgment was
 paid in full, pursuant to HRS § 478-3 (2008 Repl.).
 
7
 HAR 26 provides:
 
Rule 26. SANCTIONS FOR FAILING TO PREVAIL IN THE TRIAL DE NOVO 
(A) After the verdict is received and filed, or the court's
decision rendered in a trial de novo, the trial court may, in its
discretion, impose sanctions, as set forth below, against the non-
prevailing party whose appeal resulted in the trial de novo.
 
(B) The sanctions available to the court are as follows:
 
(1) Reasonable costs and fees (other than attorneys' fees)
actually incurred by the party but not otherwise taxable under the
law, including, but not limited to, expert witness fees, travel
costs, and deposition costs;
 
(2) Costs of jurors;
 
(3) Attorneys' fees not to exceed $15,000;
 
(C) Sanctions imposed against a plaintiff will be deducted
from any judgment rendered at trial. If the plaintiff does not
receive a judgment in his or her favor or the judgment is
insufficient to pay the sanctions, the plaintiff will pay the
amount of the deficiency. Sanctions imposed against a defendant
will be added to any judgment rendered at trial.
 
(D) In determining sanctions, if any, the court shall
consider all the facts and circumstances of the case and the intent and purpose of the [CAAP] in the State of Hawai' i. 
16 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On May 29, 2008, Momohara filed a "Motion to Apply the
 
Covered Loss Deductible to the Jury Verdict" (Motion Re CLD). 
Momohara asked the circuit court to apply HRS § 431:10C-301.5 in
 calculating Weite's recovery and deduct the CLD from the verdict
 amount. Momohara claimed that Weite's recovery was actually
 $13,090.59, or 50% of the jury's verdict of $19,628.32 reduced by
 the CLD, which was actually $6,537.73.
 
On June 9, 2008, Weite filed a memorandum in opposition
 
to the Motion Re CLD. Weite did not dispute Momohara's assertion
 that the PIP provider had actually paid $6,537.73 in PIP
 benefits. She agreed the CLD should be applied, but argued that
 applying the full CLD to the jury award would be unfair to her
 and result in a windfall to Momohara. Citing to HRS § 431:10C­301.5 and State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Gepaya, 103 Hawai
'i 142, 147, 80 P.3d 321, 326 (2003), Weite argued that 
"because the jury allocated 50% of [Weite's] damages to preexisting causes, the application of the full CLD would actually reduce [Weite's] award of general damages, in violation of the statute." Weite also argued that whether the CLD is applied pre- or post-judgment, the determination of who is the "prevailing party" pursuant to HAR 25 is made before the application of the CLD to the CAAP award or the judgment award. The circuit court granted the Motion Re CLD. 
On June 9, 2008, Momohara filed an opposition 
memorandum to the Motion Re Sanctions/Costs/Interest, in which he argued that he clearly improved upon the Arbitration Award by 30% or more at trial. First, Momohara claimed that the net CAAP award was actually $21,000, which represented the special and general damages award of $27,808.62 minus the CLD of $6,808.62. Momohara cited to Kim v. Reilly, 105 Hawai
'i 93, 94 P.3d 648 
(2004), for his assertion that the total CAAP award represented the damages award minus the CLD amount. Second, Momohara claimed, as he had in his Motion Re CLD, that Weite's recovery at trial was actually $13,090.59, or 50% of the jury's verdict of 
17
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
$19,628.32, reduced by the CLD of $6,537.73.8 Momohara cited to
 
HRS § 431:10C-301.5 in support of his assertion that the verdict
 
amount had to be reduced by the CLD amount. Given the foregoing,
 Momohara contended, he had improved upon the CAAP award by 37%
 and was the "prevailing party" pursuant to HAR 25.
 
Weite filed a reply memorandum in support of the Motion
 
Re Sanctions/Costs/Interest. She argued that Momohara's
 calculation was inconsistent with HRS § 431:10C-301.5 and the
 reference to "award" in the statute "clearly refers to the amount
 prior to the application of the CLD."
 
On June 17, 2008, the circuit court held a hearing on
 
both motions. The circuit court orally denied the Motion Re
 Sanctions/Costs/Interest and granted the Motion Re CLD:
 
THE COURT: All right. In the Court's view, even if I
didn't have Kim, looking at the plain language of 431:10C­
301.5, as I see it and what makes sense to the Court, I'm
persuaded by [Momohara's] arguments in this case, but in the
Court's view . . . Kim is a further authority for that
interpretation of how the statute should be applied. So
 . . . everything seems to hinge on the interpretation,
basically, of the statute.
 
So the Court is going to respectfully deny [the Motion
Re Sanctions/Costs/Interest] for the reasons essentially set
forth by the defense[.]
 
Likewise, the Court is going to grant [Momohara's]
motion to apply the [CLD] to the jury verdict in the manner
set forth by the defense in their moving papers.
 
On June 24, 2008, the circuit court filed an order
 
granting the Motion Re CLD and an order regarding the Motion Re
 
Sanctions/Costs/Interest, in which the court denied the motion
 with respect to the issues of CAAP sanctions, taxation of costs,
 and pre-judgment interest, but not post-judgment interest.
3. Taxable Costs
 
On June 25, 2008, Momohara filed a "Verified Bill of
 
Costs," in which he claimed he had incurred total costs of
 $2,619.73. On June 30, 2008, Weite filed a "Motion to Deny
 Taxable Costs to [Momohara] and to Award Taxable Costs to
 
8
 In a footnote, Momohara argued that a representative of Weite's PIP
provider had clarified "that the amount of PIP benefits paid" was actually
$6,537.73, "not the $6,808.62 amount previously reflected in [the PIP
provider's] records and utilized in the arbitration award."
 
18 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
[Weite]" (Motion Re Taxable Costs). Weite contended, inter alia,
 
that an award of costs to Momohara would be inequitable to her. 
Momohara filed a memorandum in opposition, and Weite filed a
 reply. On July 22, 2008, the circuit court held a hearing, at
 which the court orally denied the motion, stating: "Without
 subscribing to either party's take on what the equities are or
 aren't, I'm going to respectfully deny the motion. [Momohara is]
 the prevailing part[y] here and I think the costs are
 reasonable." On August 4, 2008, the circuit court filed an order
 denying the Motion Re Taxable Costs.

A. Summary Judgment
 
The appellate court reviews "the circuit court's grant
 
or denial of summary judgment de novo." Querubin v. Thronas, 107
 
Hawai
'i 48, 56, 109 P.3d 689, 697 (2005) (quoting Durette v. 
Aloha Plastic Recycling, Inc., 105 Hawai 'i 490, 501, 100 P.3d 60, 
71 (2004)). Accordingly, on appeal,
 
an order of summary judgment is reviewed under the same
standard applied by the circuit courts. Summary judgment is
proper where the moving party demonstrates that there are no
genuine issues of material fact and it is entitled to a
judgment as a matter of law. In other words, summary
judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions,
answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together
with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine
issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to a
judgment as a matter of law.
 
Iddings v. Mee-Lee, 82 Hawai 'i 1, 5, 919 P.2d 263, 267 (1996) 
(quoting Heatherly v. Hilton Hawaiian Vill. Joint Venture, 78 
Hawai'i 351, 353, 893 P.2d 779, 781 (1995)); see also HRCP Rule 
56(c).9

 HRCP Rule 56(c) provides, in relevant part:
 
Rule 56. SUMMARY JUDGMENT.
 
. . . . 
(c) Motion and proceedings thereon. . . . The judgment
sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions,
answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with
the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to
any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a
judgment as a matter of law. A summary judgment, interlocutory in
character, may be rendered on the issue of liability alone
although there is a genuine issue as to the amount of damages.
 
19  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On a motion for summary judgment (MSJ), "[a] fact is 
material if proof of that fact would have the effect of 
establishing or refuting one of the essential elements of a cause of action or defense asserted by the parties." Crichfield v. 
Grand Wailea Co., 93 Hawai
'i 477, 482-83, 6 P.3d 349, 354-55 
(2000) (quoting Taylor v. Gov't Employees Ins. Co., 90 Hawai 'i 
302, 305, 978 P.2d 740, 743 (1999)). 
In reviewing a circuit court's grant or denial of an 
MSJ, the appellate court "must view all of the evidence and the inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion." Crichfield, 93 Hawai
'i at 483, 6 
P.3d at 355 (brackets omitted) (quoting Taylor, 90 Hawai 'i at 
305, 978 P.2d at 743). "[A]ny doubt concerning the propriety of granting the motion should be resolved in favor of the non-moving party." GECC Fin. Corp. v. Jaffarian, 79 Hawai
'i 516, 521, 904 
P.2d 530, 535 (App. 1995). 
In deciding an MSJ, a circuit court must keep in mind
 
an important distinction:
 
A judge ruling on a motion for summary judgment cannot
summarily try the facts; his role is limited to applying the
law to the facts that have been established by the
litigants' papers. Therefore, a party moving for summary
judgment is not entitled to a judgment merely because the
facts he offers appear more plausible than those tendered in
opposition or because it appears that the adversary is
unlikely to prevail at trial. This is true even though both
parties move for summary judgment. Therefore, if the
evidence presented on the motion is subject to conflicting
interpretations, or reasonable men might differ as to its
significance, summary judgment is improper.
 
Kajiya v. Dep't of Water Supply, 2 Haw. App. 221, 224, 629 P.2d
 
635, 638-39 (1981) (quoting 10 Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R.
 Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil § 2725 (1973)).
 
In general, "summary judgment must be used with due
 
regard for its purpose and should be cautiously invoked so that
 no person will be improperly deprived of a trial of disputed
 factual issues." Miller v. Manuel, 9 Haw. App. 56, 65-66, 828
 
P.2d 286, 292 (1991) (internal quotation marks and citation
 omitted).
 
B. Grant/Denial of Motion in Limine
 
The granting or denying of a motion in limine is
reviewed for abuse of discretion.  The denial of a motion in
 
20
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
limine, in itself, is not reversible error. The harm, if
any, occurs when the evidence is improperly admitted at
trial. Thus, even if the trial court abused its discretion
in denying a party's motion, the real test is not in the
disposition of the motion but in the admission of evidence
at trial.
 
Miyamoto v. Lum, 104 Hawai 'i 1, 7, 84 P.3d 509, 515 (2004) 
(internal quotation marks, citations, ellipsis, and brackets

C. Admission of Opinion Evidence (Expert Testimony)
 
"Generally, the decision whether to admit expert
 
testimony rests in the discretion of the trial court. To the
 extent that the trial court's decision is dependant upon
 interpretation of court rules, such interpretation is a question
 of law, which this court reviews de novo." Udac v. Takata Corp.,
 
121 Hawai
'i 143, 148, 214 P.3d 1133, 1138 (App. 2009), cert.

(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
D. Jury Instructions
 
When jury instructions or the omission thereof are at
issue on appeal, the standard of review is whether, when
read and considered as a whole, the instructions given are
prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, or
misleading.
 
Erroneous instructions are presumptively harmful and
are a ground for reversal unless it affirmatively
appears from the record as a whole that the error was
not prejudicial.

Tabieros v. Clark Equip. Co., 85 Hawai 'i 336, 350, 944 P.2d 1279, 
1293 (1997).
E. Special Verdict
 
A trial court has complete discretion whether to
utilize a special or general verdict and to decide on the
form of the verdict as well as the interrogatories submitted
to the jury provided that the questions asked are adequate
to obtain a jury determination of all factual issues
essential to judgment. Although there is complete
discretion over the type of verdict form, the questions
themselves may be so defective that they constitute
reversible error.

We review the circuit court's interpretation of a
statute de novo. State v. Pacheco, 96 Hawai' i 83, 94, 26
P.3d 572, 583 (2001). Our statutory construction is guided
by established rules:
 
When construing a statute, our foremost
obligation is to ascertain and give effect to the
intention of the legislature, which is to be obtained
primarily from the language contained in the statute
itself. And we must read statutory language in the
context of the entire statute and construe it in a
 manner consistent with its purpose.
 
Id. at 94-95, 26 P.3d at 583-84.
 
Gepaya, 103 Hawai 'i at 145, 80 P.3d at 324 (quoting Troyer v. 
Adams, 102 Hawai 'i 399, 409, 77 P.3d 83, 93 (2003)).
G. Prejudgment Interest
 
"Prejudgment interest, where appropriate, is awardable
under HRS § 636-16 (1993) in the discretion of the court."
Page v. Domino's Pizza, Inc., 80 Hawai' i 204, 208, 908 P.2d
552, 556 (App. 1995) . . . (internal quotation marks
omitted). The "well-established" purpose of the statute is
to
 
allow the court to designate the commencement date of
interest in order to correct injustice when a judgment
is delayed for a long period of time for any reason,
including litigation delays. Another acknowledged
purpose of HRS § 636-16 is to discourage recalcitrance
and unwarranted delays in cases which should be more
speedily resolved. A trial court's denial of
 prejudgment interest is usually affirmed if the party
requesting the award is found to have caused the
delay, or if there is no showing that the non-moving
party's conduct unduly delayed the proceedings of the
case.

Under the plain language of HAR 26, it is within the

 what amount. Richardson v. Sport Shinko (Waikiki Corp.), 76
 
Hawai
'i 494, 511, 880 P.2d 169, 186 (1994).
I. Plain Error
 
The plain error doctrine represents a departure from the
normal rules of waiver that govern appellate review, and, as
 
22
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
such, . . . an appellate court should invoke the plain error
doctrine in civil cases only when justice so requires. As
 such, the appellate court's discretion to address plain
error is always to be exercised sparingly.

A. APPEAL
 
1.	 MPSJ Re Medical Bills and MIL Re Prior
 
Accidents
 
Weite contends the circuit court erred by denying the
 
MPSJ Re Medical Bills and denying the MIL Re Prior Accidents on
 
the issue of apportionment and allowing that issue to go to the
 jury because Momohara presented no medical expert testimony
 refuting Weite's treating physicians' opinions that her injuries
 were entirely caused by the 2000 accident.
 
a. Case law on apportionment
 
In Bachran v. Morishige, 52 Haw. 61, 62, 469 P.2d 808,
 
810 (1970), in 1964, Bachran was in her car when it was struck by
 a vehicle driven by Morishige (the 1964 accident). In 1962,
 Bachran had been injured in a previous automobile accident (1962
 accident). Id. at 63, 469 P.2d at 810. After the 1964 accident,
 
Bachran sought treatment from Dr. Poulson for injuries she
 claimed had resulted from that accident. Id. Morishige admitted
 
liability for the 1964 accident. Id. at 62, 469 P.2d at 810. 
Bachran filed a lawsuit against Morishige, and the case was tried
 by a jury on the issue of damages. Id. 
At trial, Bachran called Dr. Poulson to testify as an
 
expert witness regarding his treatment of her. Id. at 63 & 67,
 
469 P.2d at 810 & 812. Dr. Poulson testified that Bachran was
 suffering from a degenerated cervical disc, of which both the
 1962 and 1964 accidents had been contributing causes. Id. at 63,
 
469 P.2d at 810. On cross-examination, Morishige's counsel asked
 Dr. Poulson, "Could you give me such a fair or just apportionment
 on the basis of a medical probability?" Id. at 67, 469 P.2d at
 
812 (ellipsis omitted). Bachran's counsel objected on the ground
 that an opinion on causation must be based on reasonable medical
 
23
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
certainty. Id. The trial court sustained the objection to
 
prevent "too much conjecture." Id. The court also refused to
 
permit Morishige to cross-examine Dr. Poulson and another of
 
Bachran's expert witnesses, a doctor who also had treated her
 after the 1964 accident, on whether the damages could be
 apportioned between the 1962 and 1964 accidents. Id. at 63 & 66,
 
469 P.2d at 810 & 812. The trial court precluded cross-
examination of the doctors on the ground that "the facts to be
 deduced from the questions were irrelevant and immaterial." Id.
 
at 66, 469 P.2d at 812. The court orally ruled that Morishige
 was legally responsible and liable for all of Bachran's injuries
 because "a tortfeasor takes the man as he finds him." Id. at 66,
 
469 P.2d at 811. 
The jury decided the issue of damages and entered a 
verdict amount in Bachran's favor. Id. at 62, 469 P.2d at 810. 
Morishige appealed, arguing, among other things, that the court improperly ruled that he was legally responsible and liable for all of Bachran's injuries. Id. On appeal, the Hawai
'i Supreme 
Court agreed with Morishige and held that the jury should have determined the factual issue of whether Bachran had fully recovered from the injuries she suffered in the 1962 accident and was not experiencing any pain, suffering, or disability by the time of the 1964 accident. Id. at 66, 469 P.2d at 811. The 
supreme court stated that "it is for the trier of facts . . . to make a legal determination of the question of causation." Id. at 
68, 469 P.2d at 812. Hence, the supreme court concluded that the trial court had erred by ruling that Morishige was liable for all of the damages, which precluded the jury's consideration of the issue. Id. at 66, 469 P.2d at 811. The supreme court held that 
where a person has suffered injuries in a prior accident and
has fully recovered, and later he is injured by the
negligence of another person and the injuries suffered in
the later accident bring on pain, suffering and disability,
the proximate cause of the pain, suffering and disability is
the negligence of that other person. In such circumstances
 that other person should be liable for the entire damages.
 
Id. at 65, 469 P.2d at 811. The court further held, on the other
 
hand, that if Bachran "had not fully recovered from the injuries
 she suffered in the 1962 accident and in 1964 she was still
 
24
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
experiencing pain and suffering and was disabled from such
 
injuries, the total damages would not be the proximate result of
 the 1964 accident. Then . . . the damages should be
 apportioned." Id. at 66, 469 P.2d at 811-12.
 
The supreme court concluded that the trial court erred
 
by refusing to permit Morishige to cross-examine the doctors on
 the issue of apportionability of the damages. Id. at 66, 469
 
P.2d at 812. The supreme court stated that if in 1964 Bachran
 was still suffering from pain and was disabled from the injuries
 she had received in the 1962 accident, the testimony would have
 been relevant, material, and "vital to the issue to be decided by
 the jury." Id. The supreme court held:
 
Where the subject matter is technical, scientific or
medical and not of common observation or knowledge, expert
testimony is allowed into evidence. Such testimony is to
aid the jury in the determination of the issues involved and
to provide a sufficient basis for the conclusion to be drawn
by the jury rather than by conjecture and speculation.
Expert testimony is not conclusive and like any testimony,
the jury may accept or reject it.

b. MPSJ Re Medical Bills
 
On an MSJ, "[a] fact is material if proof of that fact 
would have the effect of establishing or refuting one of the 
essential elements of a cause of action or defense asserted by the parties." Crichfield, 93 Hawai
'i at 482-83, 6 P.3d at 354-55 
(quoting Taylor, 90 Hawai 'i at 305, 978 P.2d at 743). Damages 
comprise an essential element of a negligence claim. See Cho v. 
State, 115 Hawai 'i 373, 379 n.11, 168 P.3d 17, 23 n.11 (2007) 
("It is well-established that, in order for a plaintiff to prevail on a negligence claim, the plaintiff is required to prove all four of the necessary elements of negligence: (1) duty; (2) breach of duty; (3) causation; and (4) damages."). Whether
 all or some of Weite's injuries were caused by the 1988, 1994,
 and/or 1995 accidents was material to whether Weite's damages
 should be apportioned. 
Furthermore, there was a genuine issue regarding
 
whether Weite's injuries were entirely caused by the 2000
 accident. In her MPSJ Re Medical Bills, Weite argued there was
 
25
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
no genuine issue of fact regarding apportionment because 
Drs. Nierenberg and Lind both declared that her injuries following the 2000 accident were entirely attributable to the 2000 accident and Momohara did not have any medical testimony to refute those assertions. Momohara argued in his memorandum in opposition that there was a genuine issue of material fact with regard to causation because Weite had been injured in the prior accidents. To his memorandum, he attached a transcript of Weite's deposition testimony in which she stated that the prior accidents had resulted in injuries to her neck and back and that, after her prior accidents, she continued to have intermittent and periodic pain in her neck and back, including as of the time of the 2000 accident. In reviewing a circuit court's grant or denial of an MSJ, the appellate court "must view all of the evidence and the inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion." Crichfield, 93 
Hawai
'i at 483, 6 P.3d at 355 (quoting Taylor, 90 Hawai 'i at 305, 
978 P.2d at 743). Weite cites to no authority in this jurisdiction, and we find none, for the notion that in order to demonstrate that an issue of material fact exists, the non-movant must present expert testimony in his or her favor on that issue. 
c. MIL Re Prior Accidents
 
In her MIL Re Prior Accidents, Weite moved the circuit 
court for an order excluding from trial any argument regarding the need for an apportionment of her injuries to preexisting causes or prior accidents and to exclude any reference at trial to prior accidents. She claimed that Momohara was precluded from making any arguments regarding apportionment because (1) he had not retained any expert witnesses to refute Drs. Nierenberg and Lind's declaration statements that her injuries after the 2000 accident were entirely attributable to that accident and (2) he did not depose Drs. Nierenberg and Lind. Consequently, Weite maintained, "there is no competent evidence that can serve as the basis for an apportionment." At trial, Weite had the burden of proving that her injuries were caused by the 2000 accident. See 
Montalvo, 77 Hawai
'i at 296, 884 P.2d at 359 ("[I]n order to 
26
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
recover damages, a plaintiff has the burden of proving that the
 
damages were legally caused by a defendant's negligence.");
 Malani v. Clapp, 56 Haw. 507, 517, 542 P.2d 1265, 1271 (1975)
 ("[T]he burden of proving damages is always upon the
 plaintiff."). Momohara was entitled to cross-examine
 Dr. Nierenberg regarding the cause of Weite's injuries after the
 doctor testified that the injuries for which he treated Weite
 following the 2000 accident were all attributable to that
 accident. Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 702.1(a) provides:
 
Rule 702.1 Cross-Examination of experts. (a) General.
A witness testifying as an expert may be cross-examined to
the same extent as any other witness and, in addition, may
be cross-examined as to (1) the witness'[s] qualifications,
(2) the subject to which the witness'[s] expert testimony
relates, and (3) the matter upon which the witness'[s]
opinion is based and the reasons for the witness'[s]
opinion. 
The jury was entitled to determine the cause of Weite's
 
injuries and the amount of damages, if any, to be awarded. See
 
Dzurik v. Tamura, 44 Haw. 327, 330, 359 P.2d 164, 165 (1960)
 
("[I]t is for the trier of facts, not the medical witnesses, to
 make a legal determination of the question of causation."); Kato
 v. Funari, 118 Hawai
'i 375, 381, 191 P.3d 1052, 1058 (2008) 
(internal quotation marks, citation, brackets in original, and ellipsis omitted) ("[T]he proper amount of damages to be awarded is within the exclusive province of the jury, since jurors are the sole judges of all disputed questions of fact."). Further, the jury had the discretion to discredit Drs. Nierenberg and Lind's respective testimonies that Weite's injuries after the 2000 accident were entirely caused by that accident. See, e.g., 
Ass'n of Apt. Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea Resort Co., 100 Hawai
'i 97, 117-18, 58 P.3d 608, 628-29 (2002) (internal 
quotation marks and citation omitted) ("[I]t is within the province of the trier of fact to weigh the evidence and to assess the credibility of the witnesses."). 
Weite cites to no authority in this jurisdiction, and
 
we find none, to support her assertion that "[t]he law requires
 that a defense claim for apportionment be supported by expert
 medical testimony." Given the foregoing, the circuit court did
 
27
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
not abuse its discretion in denying the MPSJ Re Medical Bills and
 
denying the MIL Re Prior Accidents on the issue of
 apportionment.
10
 
2. Dr. Nierenberg's testimony, apportionment
 
Weite contends the circuit court erred by refusing to
 
allow Dr. Nierenberg to provide his expert opinion as an
 independent medical examiner on the issue of apportionment. 
Weite maintains the circuit court should have allowed
 Dr. Nierenberg to explain 
his opinion regarding [Weite's] injuries in the context of
an apportionment, i.e. Montalvo, how an apportionment is
derived, that he had performed such apportionments several
thousand times, and the definition and importance of the
findings that [Weite] was "asymptomatic" and "latent" with
respect to her neck and back injuries prior to the accident.
 
At trial, Weite's counsel proffered Dr. Nierenberg's
 
testimony on apportionment, explaining that the doctor would
 
testify about apportionment from the perspective of someone who
 specialized in IMEs and the doctor's training in and practice of
 IMEs gave him a unique and particularly helpful insight into
 apportionment. The circuit court ruled that it would not allow
 Dr. Nierenberg to testify on apportionment, but he could "[l]ink
 all the injuries to one accident." Outside the presence of the
 jury, Weite's counsel again asked the circuit court to permit
 Dr. Nierenberg to testify about "his experience as a medical
 examiner and how it relates to issues of apportionment." The
 circuit court ruled that it would allow Dr. Nierenberg to testify
 as a treating physician that in his medical opinion Weite's
 injuries could all be attributed to the 2000 accident; however,
 the court would not allow Dr. Nierenberg to testify about the law
 of apportionment or how the jury should decide apportionment.
 
While witnesses may be permitted, in a proper case, to
give an opinion on an ultimate fact involved in the case,
there is a strong consensus among the jurisdictions,
amounting to a general rule, that witnesses may not give an
opinion on a question of domestic law or on matters which
involve questions of law. The fundamental problem with
 
10
 The Hawai' i Supreme Court has, however, stated that the determination
of whether a plaintiff has fully recovered from a pre-existing condition orwhether such condition was dormant or latent is a question of fact for whichmedical testimony is especially appropriate. Montalvo, 77 Hawai' i at 299, 884
P.2d at 362 (citing Bachran, 52 Haw. at 66, 469 P.2d at 811). 
28
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
testimony containing a legal conclusion is that conveying
the witness'[s] unexpressed, and perhaps erroneous, legal
standards to the jury amounts to a usurpation of the court's
responsibility to determine the applicable law and to
instruct the jury as to that law. Expert as well as
nonexpert witnesses are subject to the prohibition against
testifying as to a question of law. The testimony of expert
witnesses is, in general, confined to matters of fact, as
distinguished from matters of law. 
Create 21 Chuo, Inc. v. Southwest Slopes, Inc., 81 Hawai 'i 512, 
522 n.4, 918 P.2d 1168, 1178 n.4 (App. 1996) (emphasis in 
original). 
In the instant case, we see no reason why Weite would
 
have offered Dr. Nierenberg's proffered testimony except to "give
 an opinion . . . on matters which involve questions of law,"
 i.e., whether Weite's damages should be apportioned. Indeed, at
 trial, when the circuit court asked Weite's counsel if he was
 "going to lay some foundation about that [Dr. Nierenberg] deals
 with these issues in his practice and then you're going to ask
 [Dr. Nierenberg] for an ultimate answer in this case right?",
 Weite's counsel answered, "Correct which the law permits." The
 circuit court permitted Dr. Nierenberg to testify extensively
 regarding Weite's injuries after the prior accidents and the 2000
 accident, including his opinion that Weite's injuries following
 the 2000 accident were caused entirely by the 2000 accident. The
 circuit court later gave the jury a detailed instruction. 
Weite does not explain how she was prejudiced by the
 
circuit court's denial of Dr. Nierenberg's proffered evidence,
 and we fail to see how such denial could have prejudiced her. 
Given the foregoing, the circuit court did not abuse
 
its discretion when the court prohibited Dr. Nierenberg from
 testifying about apportionment.
3. HCJI 7.3 and Weite's proposed JI 5
 
Weite first contends the circuit court should not have
 
given jury instructions on apportionment because there was no
 competent evidence justifying apportionment in this case. Given
 our holding in Part III.A.1 that the circuit court did not err
 when it denied the MPSJ Re Medical Bills and MIL Re Prior
 Accidents on the issue of apportionment, we need not address this
 point.
 
29
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Weite also contends the circuit court erred by refusing
 
to give Weite's proposed JI 5 on the "eggshell skull" (eggshell
 
skull) rule. The proposed instruction provided: "Generally, a
 defendant is liable in damages to a plaintiff for all injuries
 legally caused by the defendant's negligence, including damages
 resulting from the aggravation of the victim's pre-existing
 disease, condition, or predisposition to injury."
 
Weite argues that the circuit court's instruction on 
apportionment did "not consider or explain the law of damages attributed to [Momohara's] aggravation of [Weite's] injuries." Weite maintains that without her proposed JI 5, the circuit court's apportionment instruction was misleading and, thus, prejudicially insufficient. To support this argument, Weite cites to Montalvo, where the Hawai
'i Supreme Court stated that 
it is well settled that a tortfeasor is liable not only for
damages resulting from direct and unique injuries inflicted
on the victim, but also for damages resulting from the
aggravation of the victim's pre-existing disease, condition,
or predisposition to injury. Such predisposition to injury
or other special sensitivity is often involved in the
context of the so-called thin skull or eggshell skull
plaintiff.
 
77 Hawai 'i at 294, 884 P.2d at 357 (internal quotation marks and 
citation omitted). The portion of Montalvo to which Weite cites 
is not dispositive in this case. 
The modified HCJI 7.3 and HCJI 8.11, along with the
 
special verdict form given to the jury, made it unnecessary and
 inappropriate for the circuit court to give Weite's proposed
 JI 5.
 
4. Special verdict form
 
The circuit court gave the jury the following modified
 
version of HCJI 7.3:
 
In determining the amount of damages, if any, to be
awarded to [Weite], you must determine whether [Weite] had
an injury or condition which existed prior to the
February 8, 2000 incident. If so, you must determine
whether [Weite] was fully recovered from the preexisting
injury or condition or whether the preexisting injury or
condition was latent at the time of the subject incident. A
 preexisting injury or condition is latent if it was not
causing pain, suffering or disability at the time of the
subject incident.
 
If you find that [Weite] was fully recovered from the
preexisting injury or condition or that such injury or
 
30
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
31condition was latent at the time of the subject incident,
then you should not apportion any damages to the preexisting
injury or condition.
If you find [Weite] was not fully recovered and that
the preexisting injury or condition was not latent at the
time of the subject incident, you should make an
apportionment of damages by determining what portion of the
damages is attributable to the preexisting injury or
condition and limit your award to the damages attributable
to the injury caused by [Momohara].
If you are unable to determine, by a preponderance of
the evidence, what portion of the damages can be attributed
to a preexisting injury or condition, you may make a rough
apportionment.
If you are unable to make a rough apportionment, then
you must divide the damages equally between the preexisting
injury or condition and the injury caused by [Momohara].
(Emphasis added.)  The circuit court also gave the jury HCJI
8.11:  "Compensation must be reasonable.  You may award only such
damages as will fairly and reasonably compensate [Weite] for the
injuries or damages legally caused by [Momohara's] negligence."
The special verdict form, as filled out by the jury,
provided:
Question No. 1 .  Was the negligence of [Momohara] a
legal cause of the injuries and damages claimed by [Weite]?
Yes ' No _
If you answered "Yes" to Question No. 1, then go on to
answer Question No. 2.  If you have answered "No" to
Question No. 1, then please sign and date this document and
call the Bailiff.
Question No. 2.   Without regard to any possible
apportionment of her damages, what is the total amount of
[Weite's] damages?
Special Damages $ 8,556.63
General Damages $30,700.00
Now go on to Question No. 3.
Question No. 3.  What percentage of [Weite's] damages,
if any, is attributable to any of the following injuries:
a.February 8, 2000 motor vehicle accident: 50%
b.1995 motor vehicle accident: 10%
c. 1994 motor vehicle accident: 25%
d.1988 motor vehicle accident:  5%
e.1981 "lifting carpet" accident: 10%
Total (Note: The total must equal 100%)  100%FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(Emphasis added.)
 
Weite contends the circuit court erred by placing
 
separate apportionment questions on the special verdict form,
 
which, in combination with the erroneous submission of the jury's
 instructions, created confusion and allowed the jury to apportion
 Weite's damages twice. She claims the jury's answer to Question
 No. 2 represented a post-apportionment amount, which the jury
 then apportioned a second time in Question No. 3. Weite also
 argues that the jury instructions on apportionment -– i.e.,
 "limit your award to the damages attributable to the injury
 caused by [Momohara]" and only award "such damages as will fairly
 and reasonably compensate [Weite] for the injuries or damages
 legally caused by [Momohara's] negligence" –- combined with the
 instruction on the special verdict to award damages "[w]ithout
 regard to any possible apportionment" and then determine "[w]hat
 percentage of [Weite's] damages, if any, is attributable to any
 of the following injuries" was so confusing and misleading as to
 render the instructions fatally defective. Last, Weite asserts
 that the "apportionment questions on the special verdict form
 were irrelevant and unnecessary." Weite cites to Kato v. Funari
 to support these arguments.
 
In Kato, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court summarized the 
following law regarding jury instructions: 
"[T]he proper amount of damages [to be awarded] . . . is
within the exclusive province of the jury, since jurors are
the sole judges of all disputed questions of fact." Knodle 
v. Waikiki Gateway Hotel, Inc., 69 Haw. 376, 385, 742 P.2d
377, 383 (1987) (citation, internal quotation marks, and
original brackets omitted).
 
When, as here, the trial court "require[s] a jury to
return only a special verdict in the form of a special
written finding upon each issue of fact," HRCP [Rule]
49(a) [(2007)] compels the judge to "give to the jury
such explanation and instruction concerning the matter
thus submitted as may be necessary to enable the jury
to make its findings upon each issue."
 
Id. at 383, 742 P.2d at 382 (some brackets in original and
some added) (footnote omitted). Put another way,
 
the [trial court] should explain the law of the case,
point out the essentials to be proved on one side or
the other, and bring into view the relation of the
particular evidence adduced to the particular issues
involved. And all of this must be done in such a
 
manner that the jury will not be misled.

Id. at 384, 742 P.2d at 382-83 (emphasis added) (citations,

(emphasis added) (format altered). Moreover,

 rule represents a reasonable practical accommodation
of the interests of the parties involved. . . .

jury followed one instruction as opposed to another[.]

118 Hawai 'i at 381-82, 191 P.3d at 1058-59 (footnote omitted; 
expanded case cite in Gonsalves added). 
Kato's vehicle was struck by a vehicle driven by 
Funari. Kato, 118 Hawai 'i at 376-77, 191 P.3d at 1053-54. Kato 
filed a complaint against Funari, alleging that she sustained 
injuries in the accident due to Funari's negligence in operating his vehicle. Id. at 377, 191 P.3d at 1054. The only issues 
before the jury related to legal causation, damages, and the apportionment of damages resulting from Kato's pre-existing injuries and the injuries she sustained in the subject accident. Id. The Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (Second Circuit 
Court) provided the jury with a special verdict form. Id. 
Question No. 1 on the verdict form read: "Was the negligence of Funari a legal cause of injury to Kato? Answer 'Yes' or 'No' in the space provided below." Id. (brackets omitted). The jury 
answered, "Yes." Id. at 378, 191 P.3d at 1055. Question No. 2 
read: "What were Kato's total damages." Id. at 377, 191 P.3d at 
1054 (brackets omitted). The jury found that the total damages amounted to $59,536.55. Id. at 378, 191 P.3d at 1055. Question 
No. 3 read: "Were any of the injuries or pain suffered by Kato after the accident caused by conditions which existed and were symptomatic before the accident?". Id. The jury answered, 
"Yes." Id. Question No. 4 read: "State what percentage of the 
injuries[.]" Id. The jury responded, "90%". Id. 
33
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
After the Second Circuit Court denied her motion to
 
alter or amend the judgment or, in the alternative, for a new
 
trial, Kato appealed to this court, arguing that "based upon the
 jury instructions and the special verdict form, the amount of
 $59,536.55 represented a post-apportionment, not a pre-
apportioned award." Id. at 379-80, 191 P.3d at 1056-57. This
 
court disagreed and affirmed the Second Circuit Court's decision,
 holding "that there was no inconsistency between the jury
 instructions and the special verdict." Id. at 380, 191 P.3d at
 
1057. Kato applied for a writ of certiorari, which the Hawai
'i 
Supreme Court granted. Id.
 
Before the supreme court, Kato primarily argued that
 
the Second Circuit Court erred by "reducing the jury's damages
 award of $59,536.55 by ninety percent inasmuch as the jury had
 already apportioned the award to account for Kato's pre-existing
 injuries and pain." Id. at 381, 191 P.3d at 1058. The supreme
 
court held the following:
 
Here, the jury was specifically instructed that it
"must follow all the instructions given" and "must not
single out some instructions and ignore others." See Jury
Instruction No. 1; see also Myers, 76 Hawai' i at 165, 871
P.2d at 1235 (holding that it is not a permissible
"'inference,' . . . that the jury followed one instruction
as opposed to another"). With regard to the apportionment
of damages, the jury was instructed in Jury Instruction
No. 30 that it should "award such damages as will fairly and
reasonably compensate [Kato] for the injuries or damages
legally caused by [Funari's] negligence" and, in Jury
Instruction No. 31, to "limit [its] award to the damages
 attributable to the injury caused by [Funari]." (Emphases
added.) Question No. 2 on the special verdict form asked
the jury simply "what were [Kato's] total damages." 
(Emphasis added.) However, the phrase "total damages" was
not defined in the jury instructions nor on the special
verdict form. Assuming -- as we must -- that the jury
followed Jury Instructions Nos. 30 and 31, the "total"
amount of damages awarded by the jury in response to
Question No. 2 were those damages solely and totally
attributable to the injuries or damages sustained by Kato as
a result of the November 2, 2001 accident. Therefore, we
hold that -- "in view of the instructions to the jury" –­
the jury "clear[ly] and unambiguous[ly]," Dias v. Vanek, 67
Haw. 114, 117, 679 P.2d 133, 135 (1984), awarded Kato
$59,536.55 in damages, which damages represented post-
apportionment amounts, i.e., were "limit[ed] . . . to the
damages attributable to the injury caused by [Funari]," as
it was instructed to do pursuant to Instruction No. 31.
Consequently, the trial court's reduction of the jury's
award of $59,536.55 by ninety percent to "satisfy the
supposed equities of the case," id. at 117, 679 P.2d at 135
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted), was, in our
view, an improper modification of the special verdict. Were
 
34
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
this court to hold otherwise and agree with the ICA that the
trial court correctly reduced the jury's damages award, wewould have to presume that the jury believed,notwithstanding the instructions to the contrary, that theterm "total damages" included both the pre-existingconditions and post-accident injuries. Such a presumptionwould be contrary to the principle that the jurors followedthe law as was given to them and were guided by the plainlanguage of Jury Instruction No. 30 ("award only suchdamages as will fairly and reasonable compensate [Kato] forthe injuries or damages legally caused by [Funari]'snegligence") and Jury Instruction No. 31 ("limit your awardto the damages attributable to the injury caused by[Funari]"). As previously stated, such a presumption is
impermissible and contrary to our case law. Myers, 76 
Hawai'i at 165, 871 P.2d at 1235. Thus, we hold that the
ICA erred in affirming the trial court's December 8, 2004
judgment. 
. . . [B]ased on our holding that the jury's answer to

Question No. 2 represented a post-apportionment amount of
damages, we conclude that the apportionment questions (i.e.,
Question Nos. 3 and 4) were irrelevant and unnecessarily
posed to the jury. We, therefore, hold that Question Nos. 3
and 4 should not have been included on the special verdict
form.
 
We emphasize, however, that our holding today should
not be read as a blanket prohibition against the inclusionof apportionment questions relating to pre-existing injurieson special verdict forms. Our holding is limited to the
circumstances where the standard Montalvo instruction
[11] 
. . . is given to the jury, i.e., the jury is instructed tolimit its award of damages to those damages attributable
solely to the defendant's negligence. In such circumstances, apportionment questions are unnecessary and,therefore, improper because it is presumed that the jury
will follow the plain language of the Montalvo instruction 
and indicate its apportioned-award of damages on the specialverdict form. In other words, when using the Hawai' i 
Standard Civil Jury Instructions regarding apportionment,the inclusion of apportionment questions on the specialverdict form is unnecessary. However, if apportionmentquestions are to be included on the special verdict form,the jury instructions must be consistent with the questionsasked and must clearly apprise the jury of the specialfindings it is being asked to make. 
11
 In Montalvo, the Hawai' i Supreme Court held that the jury should have
been carefully instructed on apportionment 
to first determine whether Montalvo had fully recovered from any
pre-existing condition or whether such condition was dormant or
latent as of November 29, 1988. If the answer is "yes" to any of
the above inquiries, then the City is liable for all damages
legally caused by the November 29, 1988 City accident. However,
if Montalvo's pre-existing condition was not fully resolved or not
dormant or latent at the time of the City accident, then the jury
must apportion. If the jury is unable to apportion, even roughly,
then it must divide the damages equally among the various causes.
 
77 Hawai' i at 300, 884 P.2d at 363. 
35
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Id. at 383-84, 191 P.3d at 1060-61 (footnote in original
 
omitted).
 
Although the circuit court in the instant case 
instructed the jury to limit its award of damages to those "damages attributable solely to [Momohara's] negligence," the questions on the special verdict form were "consistent with the questions asked" and "clearly apprise[d] the jury of the specific findings it [was] being asked to make." Kato, 118 Hawai
'i at 
384, 191 P.3d at 1061. Unlike the special verdict form in Kato, the special verdict form in the instant case did not simply ask the jury what were Weite's total damages; rather, Question No. 2 asked, "Without regard to any special apportionment of her damages, what is the total amount of [Weite's] damages?". (Emphasis added.) The addition of this explicit language sufficed to eradicate any potential confusion the combination of jury instructions and questions on the special verdict form may have caused the jury. 
Given the foregoing, Questions No. 2 and 3 on the 
special verdict form in combination with the other jury instructions on apportionment "when read and considered as a whole" were not "prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, or misleading." Tabieros, 85 Hawai
'i at 350, 944 
P.2d at 1293. The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in including the two questions in the special verdict form.
5. Calculating the judgment
 
Weite contends the circuit court erred in calculating
 
the judgment by apportioning the jury award of special damages
 and general damages by 50% and then subtracting the full amount
 of the CLD. Weite argues that pursuant to HRS § 431:10C-301.5,
 the circuit court should have subtracted the CLD from the verdict
 amount before apportioning damages, as follows:
 
Total damages	 $39,256.63

The Judgment provides:
 
From the jury verdict in favor of [Weite] in the
amount of Nineteen Thousand Six Hundred Twenty-Eight Dollars
and Thirty-Two Cents ($19,628.32), the sum of Six Thousand
Five Hundred Thirty-Seven Dollars and Seventy-Three Cents
($6,537.73) representing the [CLD] pursuant to [HRS] § 431­10C-301.5, shall be deducted.
 
Accordingly, it is hereby ordered, adjudged and
decreed that Judgement be and is hereby entered in favor of
[Weite] in the amount of Thirteen Thousand Ninety Dollars
and Fifty-Nine Cents ($13,090.59).
 
Pursuant to the Judgment, Weite's damages are calculated as
 
follows: 
Total damages

HRS § 431:10C-301.5 provides:
 
§431:10C-301.5 Covered loss deductible.  Whenever a
 
person effects a recovery for bodily injury, whether by
suit, arbitration, or settlement, and it is determined that
the person is entitled to recover damages, the judgment,
settlement, or award shall be reduced by $5,000 or the
amount of personal injury protection benefits incurred,
whichever is greater, up to the maximum limit. The covered
 loss deductible shall not include benefits paid or incurred
under any optional additional coverage.

In State Farm v. Gepaya, the Hawai 'i Supreme Court 
stated that HRS § 431:10C-301.5 (Supp. 1997) "was part of a full 
scale change to fix the motor vehicle insurance system designed to yield a significant reduction in premiums, control litigation, and provide adequate medical coverage without a cost shift to businesses and employees." Gepaya, 103 Hawai
'i at 146, 80 P.3d 
at 325 (internal quotation marks, citation, and brackets omitted). The supreme court further stated that the CLD was "designed to discourage frivolous law suits and yet at the same time set a reasonable standard for litigation on legitimate claims." Id. at 147, 80 P.3d at 326 (quoting Conf. Comm. Rep. 
No. 171, in 1997 Senate Journal, at 798 (comments of Senator Baker)). The CLD works in the following manner: 
37
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
1) In cases where the damages associated with an
automobile accident are less than $5,000, the claimant is
precluded from suing the negligent party in an automobile
accident. This is necessary in order to keep the small
claims out of litigation.
 
2) In cases where the claimant has incurred medical
 
expenses of between $5,000 and $10,000, the result of the
litigation will have subtracted from the award the amount of
medical expenses incurred. This precludes the claimant from
receiving funds for medical expenses for which is covered
[sic] under his own policy.
. . . .
 
3) In cases where the claimant has incurred medical
expenses of $10,000 or more, any award obtained through any
means of litigation will be reduced by $10,000.
 
Gepaya, 103 Hawai 'i at 147, 80 P.3d at 326 (emphasis omitted) 
(quoting Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 171, in 1997 House Journal, at 999 
(comments of Representative Menor)). The supreme court went on to state that the role of the statute "was to preclude a claimant from receiving a 'double recovery' for medical expenses which had been paid under the PIP coverage by reducing a recovery of damages for bodily injury[.]" Gepaya, 103 Hawai
'i at 148, 80 
P.3d at 327. 
In the instant case, HRS § 431:10C-301.5 mandates that
 
the "award shall be reduced by . . . the amount of [PIP]
 benefits." The statute does not state that the award should be
 reduced after apportionment by the amount of PIP benefits. The
 CLD is to be deducted from the "total damages" awarded by the
 trier of fact prior to apportionment of the damages.
 
The issue has not been previously addressed in this
 
jurisdiction. Although this case involves apportionment of
 damages due to pre-existing injuries, cases from other
 jurisdictions addressing apportionment in the context of
 comparative negligence support our holding that the CLD should be
 deducted from the verdict amount before damages are apportioned. 
In a Florida case, Norman v. Farrow, 880 So. 2d 557 (2004),
 Farrow alleged that she was injured when her car was rear-ended
 by a car driven by William Cleff (Cleff).

 Cleff subsequently died and his wife, Cynthia Cleff Norman, as
personal representative of Cleff's estate, became the named party. Norman,
 
880 So. 2d at 558 n.1.
 
38
    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
asserted as an affirmative defense that Farrow's negligence had
 
been a cause of the collision. Id. At trial, the jury found
 
Cleff 90% negligent and Farrow 10% negligent and awarded Farrow
 $19,647.71 in total damages for medical expenses and pain and
 suffering. Id. It was undisputed that pursuant to Florida
 
Statutes § 627.736(3) (2003), Cleff was entitled to a setoff for
 "damages for which [PIP] benefits are paid or payable" to Farrow. 
Norman, 880 So. 2d at 558. Section 627.736(3) provided in
 relevant part that "[a]n injured party who is entitled to bring
 suit under the provisions of §§ 627.730-627.7405, or his or her
 legal representative, shall have no right to recover any damages
 for which [PIP] benefits are paid or payable." Norman, 880 So.
 
2d at 559-60 (footnote and emphasis omitted).
 
In its judgment, the Circuit Court, Escambia County,
 
calculated Farrow's award as follows:
 
A.	 Jury Verdict.....................  $19,647.71
 
B.	 Reduction, 10% Comparative (-$ 1,964.77)
 
Negligence.......................
 
C. 	PIP Offset ......................
 
1. PIP ($4,998.17) Offset ......
 
2. Reduction, 10% Comparative .. (-4,498.35)
 
D.	 Taxable Costs ................... (+ 4,868.44)
 
E.	 Pre-Judgment Interest on Verdict  $ 0.00
 
TOTAL JUDGMENT ON JURY VERDICT	  $18,053.03
 
Id. at 558.
 
Cleff appealed, arguing that the Escambia circuit
 
court's calculations led to a double recovery by Farrow and that
 
Cleff was entitled to a setoff of all damages for which PIP
 benefits were paid or payable to Farrow, with no consideration of
 comparable fault. Id. at 559. The Supreme Court of Florida
 
agreed, holding that
 
pursuant to section 627.736(3), which bars all recovery of
damages paid or payable by PIP benefits, the amount for
which PIP benefits have been paid or payable is to be
deducted by the trier of fact from the amount awarded as
economic damages in the verdict. Those amounts are not
 recoverable. Following that deduction, the noneconomic
damages awarded should be added and then the percentage of
comparative negligence found by the trier of fact is to be
 
39
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
applied to reduce the amount of damages which are
recoverable from the tortfeasor. The remainder is the
 amount of the judgment.
 
Id. at 560-61 (footnotes omitted). In so holding, the Florida
 
Supreme Court "disapprove[d] the holding in Assi v. Florida Auto
 Auction of Orlando, Inc., 717 So. 2d 588 (Fla. 5th DCA 1998), in
 which the Fifth District affirmed a trial court's method of
 calculation that first diminished the total award by the
 plaintiff's comparative fault and then subtracted the amount of
 damages paid or payable by the PIP benefits." Norman, 880 So. 2d
 
at 561. 
In another Florida case, Hibbard v. McGraw, 918 So. 2d
 
13
967 (Fla. 2005), Carr  (the plaintiff) sustained injuries while
riding as a passenger in a truck driven by her friend, Brock,
 when Brock swerved to avoid hitting a vehicle driven by McGraw
 and collided with a tree. Id. at 969. Carr settled with Brock
 
prior to trial. Id. at 973. A jury found Brock 70% negligent,
 
McGraw 5% negligent, and Carr 25% negligent for Carr's injuries
 and awarded damages to Carr and her mother. Id. at 970. The
 
Circuit Court, St. Johns County, deducted a setoff for PIP
 benefits after apportioning damages according to Brock and
 McGraw's relative comparative negligence. Id.
 
On appeal, Carr argued that the Circuit Court 
miscalculated the damages. Id. at 972. The District Court of
 
Appeals of Florida, Fifth District, agreed and, citing to Norman,
 held that "the amount of PIP benefits paid or payable must be
 first deducted from the amount of economic damages awarded, the
 noneconomic damages added and then comparative negligence
 considered." Id. at 973.
 
The underlying facts in a Colorado personal injury
 
case, Hickenbottom v. Schmidt, 626 P.2d 726 (Colo. 1981), were as
 follows:
 
After a trial to the jury, [Hickenbottom's] damages
due to [Schmidt's] negligence were calculated to be $10,000.
After deducting the percentage of [Hickenbottom's]
comparative negligence from the total amount of damages, the
[District Court of Logan County] entered judgment in favor

 Carr was a minor at the time of the accident and suit was filed by
Carr's mother, Hibbard, on behalf of Carr. 918 So. 2d at 969.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
of [Hickenbottom] for $7,500. However, because
[Hickenbottom] had received $9,802.35 in [PIP] benefits for
medical expenses and loss of income, the court amended the
judgment in favor of [Schmidt].
 
Id. Hickenbottom appealed, arguing that pursuant to Colorado
 
Revised Statutes (C.R.S. 1973) § 10-4-717 (1979 Cum. Supp.), the
 
district court erred by setting off the PIP payments received by
 her against the damages awarded to her. Hickenbottom, 626 P.2d
 
at 726-27. Section 10-4-717 provided that an injured party was
 "precluded from recovering damages from a tortfeasor which are
 recoverable as direct benefits under § 10-4-706, C.R.S. 1973
 (1979 Cum. Supp.)." Hickenbottom, 626 P.2d at 727. The Colorado
 
Court of Appeals held that the district court did not err by
 setting off the PIP payments received by Hickenbottom, but
 pursuant to other parts of C.R.S. 1973 and another source of law,
 "the recoverable P.I.P. benefits are to be deducted from the
 total amount of damages attributable to defendant's negligence
 before the court reduces the judgment by the percentage of
 comparative negligence attributable to plaintiff." Hickenbottom,
 
626 P.2d at 727 (emphasis added).
 
In an Alaska case, Jackman v. Jewel Lake Villa One, 170
 
P.3d 173 (Alaska 2007), Jackman fell and injured herself on a
 staircase at her apartment complex, the Jewel Lake Villa
 Apartments (Jewel Lake). Id. at 174. Jackman sued Jewel Lake. 
Id. A jury found Jewel Lake was 51% at fault for Jackman's
 
injuries. Id. The Superior Court, Third Judicial District,
 
Anchorage, calculated the award to Jackman as follows:
 
[The superior court] initially divided the full jury award,
$7,147.23, to derive Jewel Lake's fifty-one percent share of
the damages: $3,645.09. After adjusting for interest,
costs, and attorney's fees, the court subtracted the full
amount of the advance medical payments from Jewel Lake's
share of the damages to arrive at a "maximum amount . . .
payable" of $906.63 under the verdict.
 
Id. at 178. Jackman appealed, arguing that the superior court 
miscalculated the award. Id. at 177. The Supreme Court of
 
Alaska agreed, holding the following:
 
The [superior] court's approach treated the medical
expense payments as pure liability payments -– payments
meant to compensate Jackman only for Jewel Lake's
proportionate share of the fault. Yet . . . the record
 fails to disclose the specific basis for the medical
payments. Jewel Lake's insurer appears to have
 
41
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
unconditionally reimbursed Jackman for her medical expenses:
there is no indication of any reservations or restrictions
suggesting that the reimbursements were paid as compensation
for Jewel Lake's potential share of the fault. Absent
 evidence establishing the actual basis for the injurer's
payments, we see no obvious grounds for crediting the entire
amount of the advance payments against the portion of the
jury verdict reflecting Jewel Lake's share of the fault.
 
Id. at 178. The supreme court went on to state that "[a]bsent
 
case-specific evidence establishing that the payment in question
 was actually based on potential fault, then, it simply lowers the
 total damages still to be paid, leaving all negligent parties
 responsible for their proportionate share of the harm." Id. at
 
179. The supreme court added that "deducting advance payments
 
from the jury's total award poses a risk of double recovery only
 if we assume that those payments were made on the basis of the
 defendant's potential fault." Id. In a footnote, the supreme
 
court stated that its approach was similar by analogy to the
 method adopted by the Florida Supreme Court in Norman and the
 Colorado Court of Appeals in Hickenbottom. Jackman, 170 P.3d at
 
179 n.16.
 
Given the foregoing, the circuit court in the instant
 
case erred when it subtracted the CLD from the jury's damage
 award after apportioning the damages.
6. Prevailing party and CAAP sanctions
 
HAR 25(A) provides that the "'Prevailing Party' in a
 
trial de novo is the party who (1) appealed and improved upon the
 arbitration award by 30% or more . . . . For the purpose of this
 rule, 'improve' or 'improved' means to increase the award for a
 plaintiff or to decrease the award for the defendant."
 
HAR 26 provides in relevant part that "[a]fter the
 
verdict is received and filed, or the court's decision rendered
 in a trial de novo, the trial court may, in its discretion,
 impose sanctions . . . against the non-prevailing party whose
 appeal resulted in the trial de novo."
 
Weite contends the circuit court erred by finding that
 
Momohara, not Weite, was the "prevailing party" for purposes of
 assessing CAAP sanctions and the court should have determined who
 the CAAP "prevailing party" was before subtracting the CLD. She
 
42
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
claims that Momohara's improvement on the arbitration award in
 
this case should be calculated as follows: 
CAAP award $27,808.62 
Judgment (after 50% apportionment
of special and general damages) $19,628.32 
Amount of improvement $ 8,180.30 
% of improvement [reduction] 29.42% 
Consequently, Weite maintains, Momohara was not the prevailing
 
party pursuant to HAR 25(A) because he only improved upon the
 arbitration award by 29.42%.
 
In his Motion Re Sanctions/Costs/Interest, Momohara 
argued that he clearly improved upon the Arbitration Award by 30% or more at trial and was the "prevailing party" under HAR 25(A). First, Momohara claimed that the net CAAP award was actually $21,000, or the special and general damages award of $27,808.62 minus the CLD of $6,808.62. Momohara cited to Kim v. Reilly, 105 Hawai
'i 93, 94 P.3d 648 (2004), for his assertion that the total 
CAAP award represented the damages award minus the CLD amount. Second, Momohara claimed, as he had in his Motion Re CLD, that Weite's recovery at trial was actually $13,090.59, or 50% of the jury's verdict of $19,628.32, reduced by the CLD of $6,537.73. Momohara cited to HRS § 431:10C-301.5 in support of his assertion that the verdict amount had to be reduced by the CLD amount. Based on Momohara's assertions in his opposition memorandum to the Motion Re Sanctions/Costs/Interest, Momohara's calculation was as follows: 
CAAP award:	 $27,808.62
 
-CLD:	  <$ 6,808.62>
$21,000.00
 
Damages (50%):	 $19,628.32
 
-CLD:	  <$ 6,537.73>
$13,090.59
 
% improvement (reduction): 37%
 
In Richardson v. Sport Shinko (Waikiki Corp.), the 
Hawai
'i Supreme Court stated the following regarding HAR 26: 
43
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
[T]he legislature statutorily codified the CAAP as a means
to reduce the delay and costs involved in protracted
litigation by providing for a procedure to obtain prompt and
equitable resolution of certain civil actions in tort
through arbitration. At the same time, the supreme court
was delegated the authority to adopt rules to implement the
CAAP. In doing so, this court promulgated HAR 26 to enforce
the objectives of the CAAP.
 
Indisputably, baseless or frivolous appeals from an
arbitration decision subvert the purposes of the CAAP
because they prevent prompt and equitable resolutions of
actions and, as such, must be discouraged. The goals of the
CAAP would be jeopardized without a mechanism to ensure
meaningful participation in the program and to encourage
participants to seriously evaluate the merits of their case
following the arbitration before expending the additional
time and expense of a trial de novo. In other words, the
vital objectives of the CAAP cannot be met if participants
invariably treat arbitration as a routine or pro forma step
along the path to trial de novo by rejecting reasonable
arbitration decisions or reasonable post-arbitration
settlement offers, even though the decision to appeal is not
technically "frivolous."
 
Thus, HAR sanctions may be imposed to penalize a non-
prevailing party whose decision to appeal the arbitration
award and pursue a trial de novo was unreasonable under the
 
circumstances of the particular case, albeit grounded to
some degree in law or fact.
 
76 Hawai 'i at 510-11, 880 P.2d at 185-86 (internal quotation 
marks, citation, and footnote omitted).
 
In the instant case, the arbitrator awarded Weite
 
$7,808.62 in special damages, $20,000 in general damages, and
 
$299.50 in costs. The Arbitration Award provides that "[t]otal
 damages shall be reduced by a CLD in the amount of $6,808.62." 
HAR 25(A) provides that the "prevailing party" at trial is "the
 party who appealed and improved upon the arbitration award by 30%
 or more." In the instant case, for purposes of determining who
 was the prevailing party, the recovery at trial should be
 compared with the CAAP award after the subtraction of the CLD, or
 $21,000. Kim, 105 Hawai
'i at 96, 94 P.3d at 651. 
In accordance with our holding in Part III.A.5 of this
 
discussion, Weite's net damages award should have been
 $16,359.45. Both the CAAP award and the damages award reflect
 the subtraction of the CLD. "In order to meaningfully compare a
 plaintiff's CAAP award with the amount a plaintiff recovers at
 trial de novo, the respective amounts must be based on the same
 underlying factors. Otherwise, the trial court will have no way
 
44
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
of determining whether an award of a different value is an 
improvement or a reduction." Molinar v. Schweizer, 95 Hawai 'i 
331, 335-36, 22 P.3d 978, 982-83 (2001). 
Given our discussion on this point, the calculation for
 
purposes of determining the prevailing party in this case is as
 follows: 
CAAP award: Damages award:Amount of reduction: $21,000.00 
<$16,359.45> 
$ 4,640.55 
Consequently, because Momohara reduced the CAAP award by 22%, he
 was not the "prevailing party" under HAR 25. The circuit court 
abused its discretion in denying the Motion Re Sanctions/Costs/
 Interest.
 
7. Prejudgment interest
 
Weite contends the circuit court abused its discretion
 
in not awarding her prejudgment interest. Weite maintains that
 "the equities in this case merit such an award" because "the
 record is clear that [Momohara] and AIG acted in bad faith during
 settlement negotiations." In support of this contention, Weite
 maintains that the parties' initial settlement positions were
 only $1,100 apart, but once she filed the lawsuit, AIG withdrew
 its $17,000 settlement offer and lowered its offer to $5,000. 
Weite also contends that "[Momohara] and AIG's litigation tactics
 were deplorable" in that
 
[t]he defense tried repeatedly to conduct discovery after
the discovery cutoff, resulting in monetary sanctions, but
requiring a postponement of the trial date. Further, rather
than deposing the medical experts and stipulating to the
authenticity and reasonableness of the medical treatment and
bills, the defense forced this matter to be litigated as
well which ultimately was decided in favor of [Weite].
 
In sum, Weite maintains that
 
the defense tried to get away with defending the case as
cheaply as possible,
14 even though defense costs far
exceeded the amount needed to settle the case, and far
exceeded the jury verdict as well. Although "bad faith" is
not required in order for [Weite] to obtain prejudgment
 
14
 At the hearing on the MPSJ Re Medical Bills, Weite's counsel argued:
"What AIG does in these cases, . . . they take these things and they force the
plaintiff to go to trial and they try them as cheaply as they can get away
with and try to make plaintiffs spend the money to go to trial."
 
45
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
interest, such factors should persuade the Court that full
 
prejudgment interest is appropriate here.
 
(Emphasis in original.) In her Motion Re Sanctions/Costs/
 
Interest, Weite's arguments on this point were substantially
 similar to her arguments on appeal.
 
In Kalawaia v. AIG Hawai
'i Insurance Co., 90 Hawai 'i 
167, 172, 977 P.2d 175, 180 (1999) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), the Hawai
'i Supreme Court stated that 
"[p]rejudgment interest is an element of complete compensation. Prejudgment interest serves to compensate for the loss of use of money due as damages from the time the claim accrues until judgment is entered, thereby achieving full compensation for the injury those damages are intended to redress." "[P]rejudgment interest compensates for the inevitable litigation delay in being reimbursed for damages incurred." Molinar, 95 Hawai
'i at 335, 22 
P.3d at 982. "The purpose of prejudgment interest is to discourage recalcitrance and unwarranted delays in cases which should be more speedily resolved." Metcalf v. Voluntary 
Employees' Benefit Ass'n of Hawaii, 99 Hawai
'i 53, 61, 52 P.3d 
823, 831 (2002) (internal quotation marks, citation, and brackets omitted). 
"A trial court's denial of prejudgment interest is 
usually affirmed if the party requesting the award is found to have caused the delay or if there is no showing that the non­moving party's conduct unduly delayed the proceedings of the case." Page v. Domino's Pizza, Inc., 80 Hawai
'i 204, 209, 908 
P.2d 552, 557 (App. 1995) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). 
[I]t is clearly within the discretion of the circuit court
to deny prejudgment interest where appropriate, for example,
where: (1) the defendant's conduct did not cause any delay
in the proceedings; (2) the plaintiff himself has caused or
contributed to the delay in bringing the action to trial; or
(3) an extraordinary damage award has already adequately
compensated the plaintiff.
 
Roxas v. Marcos, 89 Hawai 'i 91, 153, 969 P.2d 1209, 1271 (1998) 
(citations omitted). In Tri-S Corp. v. Western World Insurance 
Co., 110 Hawai 'i 473, 498, 135 P.3d 82, 107 (2006), the Hawai 'i 
Supreme Court held that 
46
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(1) if fault is found on the part of the party seeking
interest, denial of interest will not be considered an abuse
of discretion; (2) if fault is found on the part of the
party opposing interest, an award of interest will not be
considered an abuse of discretion; and (3) where no fault is
found on either side, the trial court may still award or
deny prejudgment interest in its discretion, depending on
the circumstances of the case.
 
Although Weite argues that "the record is clear that
 
[Momohara] and AIG acted in bad faith during settlement
 
negotiations," in support of this contention, Weite cites only to
 the actions of AIG, not Momohara, during her settlement
 negotiations with AIG. Weite presents no evidence on appeal that
 Momohara acted in bad faith during those negotiations. In the
 "Background" section of her opening brief, Weite does describe
 Momohara's offers of settlement to her. She states that Momohara
 offered her $5,000 in general damages, net of the CLD, then
 proffered a Rule 68 Offer of Settlement in the amount of $10,000
 in general damages and net of the CLD. Given Weite's recovery in
 this case, which should have been $16,359.45 net of the CLD,
 Momohara's offers were not per se indicative of any
 disingenuousness on his part.
 
Weite further argues that she was entitled to
 
prejudgment interest because Momohara declined to depose
 Drs. Nierenberg and Lind or stipulate to the authenticity and
 reasonableness of Weite's medical treatment and expenses. As we
 have already discussed, Momohara was not required to depose the
 doctors to rebut their deposition testimony that Weite's injuries
 after the 2000 accident were entirely attributable to that
 accident. Further, Momohara validly argued in his memorandum in
 opposition to the MPSJ Re Medical Bills that there was a genuine
 issue of material fact regarding the reasonableness and necessity
 of Weite's medical expenses because the evidence showed Weite's
 injuries could have resulted from one or more of her prior
 accidents. Given that theory, it was not unreasonable for
 Momohara to decline to stipulate that Weite's medical treatments
 following that accident were necessary or reasonable. 
Weite also contends "[Momohara] and AIG's litigation
 
tactics were deplorable" because the "defense tried repeatedly to
 
47
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
conduct discovery after the discovery cutoff, resulting in
 
monetary sanctions, but requiring a postponement of the trial
 date." On October 17, 2007, Weite filed her Motion to Strike
 Oda/Preclude Video. On November 7, 2007, the circuit court filed
 its order in which the court sanctioned Momohara for the
 discovery violations, but declined to strike Oda as a witness or
 preclude the video from trial. The circuit court continued the
 trial from November 19, 2007 to February 19, 2008 "to allow the
 parties to conclude discovery." On November 14, 2007, Weite
 moved to continue the trial to May 5, 2008 because Dr. Nierenberg
 was going to be off-island from mid-January to mid-March 2008 and
 unavailable to testify at trial. On November 30, 2007, the
 circuit court filed an order granting the motion. Given that
 Momohara's discovery violations only resulted in a roughly three-
month delay and Weite does not argue Momohara knew the delay
 would result in Weite having to request another continuance so
 Dr. Nierenberg could testify at trial, we fail to see why the
 circuit court should have awarded Weite prejudgment interest on
 this basis.

205-06, 908 P.2d at 553-54. Page filed a complaint against Domino's, alleging that the incident resulted from the negligence of Domino's and Page had suffered injuries as a result of such negligence. Id. at 206, 908 P.2d at 554. A jury found Domino's 
was negligent and awarded damages to Page. Id. The award was 
entered over three-and-a-half years after Page had been injured. Id. at 210, 908 P.2d at 558. Page moved the circuit court for an award of prejudgment interest, which motion the court denied. Id. at 206, 908 P.2d at 554. The circuit court stated that Page was not entitled to the award "because the period of time it took to complete the case was not extraordinary considering 'the totality of the case.'" Id. at 209, 908 P.2d at 557 (footnote 
omitted). 
In a cross-appeal to this court, Page argued that the
 
circuit court erred in denying his motion for prejudgment

interest. Id. at 206, 908 P.2d at 554. Page maintained, among
 
other things, that he was "entitled to prejudgment interest
 
because [Domino's] delayed the speedy resolution of the case by
 not offering more than $25,000 during the numerous settlement
 conferences held during the litigation." Id. at 209, 908 P.2d at
 
557. This court disagreed, holding that the circuit court had
 
not abused its discretion in denying the motion for prejudgment
 interest on the basis that Domino's "offer of $25,000 was not
 unreasonable in light of its belief regarding disputed issues on
 liability and apportionment of damages." Id. at 210, 908 P.2d at
 
558. This court further stated: "There is no evidence in the
 
records to indicate that any delays in the proceedings were due
 to the conduct of either Page or [Domino's]. The continuances of
 the trial date were not due to the conduct of either." Id. 
In the instant case, the accident occurred on
 
February 8, 2000. Weite filed the original complaint on
 August 25, 2005 and the First Amended Complaint on February 3,
 2006, after negotiations with AIG allegedly stalled. Trial was
 set for the week of November 19, 2007. On October 17, 2007,
 Weite filed her Motion to Strike Oda/Preclude Video. On
 November 7, 2007, the circuit court filed an order, in which the
 court sanctioned Momohara for the discovery violations, but
 declined to strike Oda as a witness or preclude the video from
 trial. The circuit court continued the trial to February 19,
 2008 "to allow the parties to conclude discovery." On
 November 14, 2007, Weite moved to continue trial to May 5, 2008
 because Dr. Nierenberg was unavailable to testify the week of
 February 19, 2008. On May 15, 2008, the jury issued its verdict,
 awarding Weite damages.
 
There is no evidence in the record on appeal to suggest 
that Momohara's conduct unduly delayed the proceedings of the case so as to justify an award of prejudgment interest to Weite. Page, 80 Hawai
'i at 209, 908 P.2d at 557. The circuit court did 
not abuse its discretion by denying Weite's motion for prejudgment interest.

8. Taxable costs
 
Weite contends the circuit court abused its discretion
 
in denying her Motion Re Taxable Costs. Given our holding that
 
Momohara was not the prevailing party at trial, we vacate the
 award of costs to Momohara as the prevailing party.
B. CROSS-APPEAL
 
1. MIL Re Medical Claims
 
Momohara contends the circuit court erred in denying
 
his MIL Re Medical Claims. He argues that the circuit court
 should have limited Weite's claimed medical expenses in amount
 and frequency to those permitted under the workers' compensation
 fee schedule, pursuant to HRS § 431:10C-308.5(b), and prohibited
 Weite from introducing evidence of medical expenses in excess of
 that amount. HRS § 431:10C-308.5(b) provides in relevant part
 that "[t]he charges and frequency of treatment for services
 
15
specified in section 431:10C-103.5(a) [(Supp. 1999) ] except for
emergency services provided within seventy-two hours following a
 motor vehicle accident resulting in injury, shall not exceed the 

 
charges and frequency of treatment permissible under the workers'
 compensation schedules."

 HRS § 431:10C-103.5 provides:
 
§431:10C-103.5 Personal injury protection benefits;
defined; limits.  (a) Personal injury protection benefits, with
respect to any accidental harm, means all appropriate and
reasonable treatment and expenses necessarily incurred as a result
of the accidental harm and which are substantially comparable to
the requirements for prepaid health care plans, including medical,
hospital, surgical, professional, nursing, advanced practice
nursing recognized pursuant to chapter 457, dental, optometric,
chiropractic, ambulance, prosthetic services, products and
accommodations furnished, x-ray, psychiatric, physical therapy
pursuant to prescription by a medical doctor, occupational
therapy, rehabilitation, and therapeutic massage by a licensed
massage therapist when prescribed by a medical doctor.
. . . .
 
(c) Personal injury protection benefits shall be subject to
an aggregate limit of $10,000 per person for services provided
under this section. An insurer may offer additional coverage in
excess of the $10,000 aggregate limit for services provided under
this section, or as provided by rule of the commissioner.

 HRS § 431:10C-308.5(a) states that "the term 'workers' compensation
schedules' means the schedules adopted and as may be amended by the director
of labor and industrial relations for workers' compensation cases under
(continued...)
 
50
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Momohara argues that HRS § 431:10C-308.5 limits Weite
 
to a medical expenses claim that does not exceed the charges and
 
frequency of treatment allowable under the workers' compensation
 schedules, which claim in this case was the amount her PIP
 carrier had paid. He presumes that Weite's PIP carrier
 determined the amount in PIP benefits to pay out based on the
 workers' compensation schedules, pursuant to HRS § 431:10C-308.5.
 
As Weite argues in her answering brief, Momohara did
 
not make these arguments in his MIL Re Medical Claims. There,
 Momohara argued that Weite should be precluded from requesting an
 award for medical expenses because in response to an
 interrogatory, Weite stated only that she had incurred $7,808.62
 in medical expenses stemming from the 2000 accident -- the $1,000
 deductible she paid and the $6,808.62 paid by her PIP provider. 
He further argued that because Weite had not supplemented her
 response, she should be held to that amount. He added that Weite
 had neither exhausted the amount of medical insurance benefits
 available to her, nor indicated that she had incurred any
 expenses in excess of $7,808.62. Regardless, we review the
 contention for plain error.
 
Momohara's argument is based on a misreading of HRS
 
§ 431:10C-308.5. That statute clearly provides in relevant part
 that "[t]he charges and frequency of treatment for services
 specified in section 431:10C-103.5(a) . . . shall not exceed the
 charges and frequency of treatment permissible under the workers'
 compensation schedules." HRS § 431:10C-103.5 defines and limits
 PIP benefits. Hence, HRS § 431:10C-308.5 limits the payment of
 PIP benefits to payments permitted under the workers'
 compensation schedules. The statute does not preclude a
 plaintiff injured in an automobile accident from receiving
 special damages beyond what she received in PIP benefits. 
The circuit court did not plainly err by failing to
 
limit Weite's recovery for medical expenses to what she had
 already received in PIP benefits.

2. Dr. Nierenberg's testimony re medical expenses
 
Momohara contends that the circuit court erred in
 
permitting Dr. Nierenberg to testify regarding the amounts,
 
reasonableness, and necessity of Weite's medical expenses
 incurred at QMC, RA, and ORS, over Momohara's objection. 
Momohara argues that
 
[t]here was no evidentiary foundation for Dr. Nierenberg's
testimony. In particular, there was no testimony or
evidence presented that Dr. Nierenberg was in any way
involved in the billing for any other medical care
providers. There was also no testimony or evidence that he
had any personal knowledge of the reasonable and customary
billing practices or charges for diagnostic studies (i.e.
the MRI scans) or physical therapy.
 
To support this argument, Momohara cites to HRE Rules 602 and
 
801.
 
At trial, the following discussion took place outside
 
the presence of the jury:
 
THE COURT: As far as reasonableness of [medical]
bills and that sort of thing, let's take that first,
[Momohara's counsel], do you have a position.
 
[MOMOHARA'S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, [Dr. Nierenberg]
can testify as to the reasonableness of the bills as his
role as treatment.
 
THE COURT: Treatment.
 
[MOMOHARA'S COUNSEL]: Treating physician. I don't
 
have a problem with that. 
THE COURT: All right. That's going to be allowed. I
 
don't hear an objection to that.
 
Go on, [Weite's Counsel], what do you want?
 [WEITE'S COUNSEL]: It's not just his but also he
referred her going to be talking about treatment, physical
therapy, whether that was reasonableness, about their bills,
the same thing with respect to MRI's. This is what he does.
 
THE COURT: [Momohara's Counsel], you object to any of
that.
 
[MOMOHARA'S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, if he lays the
proper foundation, but, the foundation treating he made a
referral. And, if the physical therapist reported back to
him, part of his files, he can testify to that. As far as
 what they charge, I'm not sure how he knows that but if he
does it customarily, they can lay a foundation for it.
Nothing to do with his -­
THE COURT: Well, what I hear [Weite's Counsel] saying
is that part of the foundation for his testifying another
physician's treatment including physical therapy as an
independent medical examiner he's very use to reviewing that
sort of thing, etc.
 
52
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
So, if that's the objection, I heard [Weite's Counsel]
qualify the objection, I will allow that over objection.
Lay the foundation. Given that, that will be allowed.
 
Dr. Nierenberg testified that Weite's medical charges 
resulting from the 2000 accident of $1,286.96 from Dr. Nierenberg 
for fourteen visits to his office, $1,896 from QMC for two MRIs, $441 from RA for reading and interpreting the MRIs, and $3,457.47 from ORS for thirty-seven physical therapy sessions were all reasonable and necessary. Dr. Nierenberg testified that each charge was within the range commonly charged by other providers in Hawai
'i at the time he treated Weite for her injuries from the 
2000 accident. 
On appeal, Momohara contends he objected to the
 
testimony, citing to an earlier objection he had made to "the
 scope of Dr. Nierenberg's testimony." However, in his earlier
 objection, Momohara objected to Dr. Nierenberg's proffered
 testimony regarding apportionment of damages, not testimony
 regarding the necessity or reasonableness of Weite's medical
 expenses. We review this point for plain error.
 
HRE Rule 602 provides:
 
Rule 602 Lack of personal knowledge. A witness may
not testify to a matter unless evidence is introduced
sufficient to support a finding that the witness has
personal knowledge of the matter. Evidence to prove
personal knowledge may, but need not, consist of the
witness'[s] own testimony. This rule is subject to the
provisions of rule 703, relating to opinion testimony by
expert witnesses.
 
HRE Rule 703 provides: 
Rule 703 Bases of opinion testimony by experts.  The
 
facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert
bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by or
made known to the expert at or before the hearing. If of a
 type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular
field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject,
the facts or data need not be admissible in evidence. The
 court may, however, disallow testimony in the form of an
opinion or inference if the underlying facts or data
indicate lack of trustworthiness.
 
Weite called Dr. Nierenberg to testify at trial as an
 
expert witness. Therefore, HRE Rule 703 applies. Pursuant to
 
that rule, Dr. Nierenberg did not have to have personal knowledge
 of the customary billing practices of any and all medical
 providers to testify that Weite's medical expenses were necessary
 
53
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and reasonable. It sufficed that his testimony was based on his
 
experience as a treating physician and IME doctor and his
 knowledge of the industry practice.
 
Momohara characterizes Dr. Nierenberg's testimony as
 
hearsay, under the definition set forth in HRE Rule 801
 ("'Hearsay' is a statement, other than one made by the declarant
 while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to
 prove the truth of the matter asserted."). However,
 Dr. Nierenberg did not testify that the charges set forth in the
 medical bills were accurate; rather, he testified that they met
 the industry standard at the time he treated Weite for injuries
 stemming from the 2000 accident. The testimony did not
 constitute hearsay.
 
Given the foregoing, the circuit court did not plainly
 
err by allowing Dr. Nierenberg to testify regarding the necessity
 and reasonableness of Weite's medical expenses.
V.
 
The portion of the Judgment, filed on June 18, 2008 in
 
the Circuit Court of the First Circuit, setting forth the
 calculation and resulting amount of Weite's damages and costs is
 vacated, and this case is remanded to the circuit court for
 proceedings consistent with this opinion. The remainder of the
 Judgment is affirmed.
