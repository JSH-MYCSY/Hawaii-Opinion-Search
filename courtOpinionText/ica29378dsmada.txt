ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE’S 
MOTION TO STRIKE OPENING BRIEF AND DISMISS APPEAL 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Leonard, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of the Motion to Strike Opening 
Brief and Dismiss Appeal filed by Plaintiff-Appellee State of 
Hawai'i on June 29, 2011, the papers in support and opposition, 
and the records and files herein, it appears that: (1) the State of Hawai' i moves for an order striking the opening brief filed by 
Defendant-Appellant Paulette Paonessa (Paonessa), pro se, and dismissing her appeal; (2) this court granted Paonessa numerous extensions of time to file the opening brief; (3) in our final order granting a motion to extend time, we stated that we would dismiss Paonessa's appeal if she did not file an opening brief;  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(4) the body of Paonessa's opening brief, in its entirety, states
 
as follows:
 
OPENING BRIEF
 
Comes now Defendant-Appellant PAULETTE PAONESSA,
pro se, and hereby submits her Opening Brief pursuant to
Rule 28(b) of the Hawaii Rules of Appellate Procedure.
 
Appellant prays that this Honorable Court will vacate
and dismiss the Judgment below, or remand this action for a
new trial, before a different Judge of the First Circuit
Court, in the interests of justice and fairness, for the
reasons set forth herein.
 
(5) Paonessa fails to state points of error or argument 
supporting her appeal, as required by Hawai' i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure Rule 28(b), leaving us with nothing of substance to review. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion to
 
Strike Opening Brief and Dismiss Appeal is granted and this
 appeal is dismissed.
