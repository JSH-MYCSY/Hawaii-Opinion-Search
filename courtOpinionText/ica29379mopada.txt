APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 07-1-0057)
MEMORANDUM OPINION
(By:  Foley and Fujise, JJ.;
Nakamura, C.J., concurring separately)
Plaintiffs-Appellants Denise Shaner, as Personal
Representative of the Estate of Thomas B. Roth, and Mildred L.
Roth (collectively, Plaintiffs) appeal from the "Final Judgment
in Favor of Defendants Don Dixon and Contenia Dixon
[collectively, Dixons] and Against [Plaintiffs]" (Final Judgment)
filed on August 27, 2008 in the Circuit Court of the Third
Circuit1 (circuit court).
Pursuant to the June 10, 2008 "Order Granting [Dixons']
Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiffs' First Amended
Complaint Filed March 9, 2007, Filed May 12, 2008" (Order
Granting Dixons' SJ Motion), the circuit court found that Dixons
did not owe a duty of care to Thomas B. Roth (deceased) andNOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
  On January 18, 2008, all the parties stipulated that Plaintiffs'2
First Amended Complaint should be amended to change the erroneously named
Christopher Kraus to Christian Kraus.  Plaintiffs filed a motion on
January 31, 2008 to so amend the First Amended Complaint.  On March 17, 2008,
the circuit court filed an "Order Granting Plaintiffs' Motion to Amend
Complaint to Properly Reflect the Legal Name of Christian Kraus, Erroneously
Named as Christopher Kraus."  On April 7, 2008, Plaintiffs filed a Second
Amended Complaint, which was identical to the First Amended Complaint except
for the name change of Christopher Kraus to Christian Kraus.  There is no
indication in the record that the Second Amended Complaint was served on the
defendants, and none of the defendants filed an answer to the Second Amended
Complaint.  However, in the Final Judgment, the circuit court dismissed "all
other claims, counterclaims or cross-claims . . . without prejudice."
2entered summary judgment in favor of Dixons and against
Plaintiffs on Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint.2 
On appeal, Plaintiffs contend the circuit court erred
(1) in determining that Dixons did not owe a duty of
care to Thomas B. Roth, deceased (Mr. Roth);
(2) in failing to recognize that genuine issues of
material fact had been submitted by Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs
should have been permitted to proceed to trial on their claims;
(3) in granting Dixons' "Motion for Summary Judgment
on Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint Filed March 9, 2007" (SJ
Motion) filed April 24, 2008; and
(4) in denying Plaintiffs' "Motion for Reconsideration
of the Order Granting [Dixons'] Motion for Summary Judgment on
Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint Filed March 9, 2007, Filed on
April 24, 2008, and/or Motion for Certification Under [Hawai #i
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP)] Rule 54(b), and/or Leave to File
an Interlocutory Appeal Pursuant to [Hawaii Revised Statutes
(HRS) §] 641-1(b), and for Stay of Further Proceedings Pending
the Appeal and/or HRCP Rule 56(f) Request" (Motion for
Reconsideration) filed June 20, 2008.
I.  BACKGROUND
Dixons hired Tree Works, Inc. (TWI) to remove trees
from their unimproved property located in P~ hoa, Hawai #i.  TWI
specialized in tree removal, including removal of trees nearNOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
  Dixons attempted to hire an excavation company to remove the trees,3
but the company refused because of the proximity of electric lines to three
gunpowder trees on the property. 
  Christian also filed a cross-claim against Dixons.4
  Michael filed a "Petition for Finding of Good Faith Settlement5
Relating to Plaintiffs and Defendants [Michael and Christian]" on April 29,
2008, and the circuit court granted the petition.
3electric lines.  TWI employed Mr. Roth, who had experience with
tree removal near electric lines.3
On October 6, 2005, TWI dispatched a crew, including
Mr. Roth, to Dixons' property.  The crew understood that they
would be working around live electric lines.  During the cleanup
process, Roth was holding a metal hook that was attached to the
crane's boom.  When the boom, operated by TWI supervisor
Christian Klaus (Christian), touched a live power line, a high
voltage current electrocuted Mr. Roth and killed him.
  Plaintiffs filed a Complaint on February 27, 2007 and a
First Amended Complaint on March 9, 2007 against Michael M. Kraus
(Michael), Christian, and Dixons (collectively, Defendants). 
After Defendants filed their respective answers4 to the First
Amended Complaint, Dixons filed their SJ Motion.  Attached to the
SJ Motion was the deposition of Michael, who was president of
TWI.  During questioning, Michael admitted that the tree removal
job was conducted in violation of safety directives specified in
the crane manual.
Plaintiffs filed an opposition memorandum to the SJ
Motion.5  The circuit court thereafter filed the Order Granting
Dixons' SJ Motion.
Plaintiffs filed their Motion for Reconsideration,
which the circuit court denied on August 27, 2008.  The circuit
court filed the Final Judgment on that same date, and Plaintiffs
timely appealed.NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
  In Plaintiffs' Opening Brief, their "concise statement of points of6
error" violates Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4)
because Plaintiffs fail to identify "(i) the alleged error committed by the
court or agency; (ii) where in the record the alleged error occurred; and
(iii) where in the record the alleged error was objected to or the manner in
which the alleged error was brought to the attention of the court or agency." 
A violation of this rule dictates judicial disregard of non-compliant points. 
HRAP 28(b)(4)(D) ("Points not presented in accordance with this section will
be disregarded, except that the appellate court, at its option, may notice
plain error not presented.").  Also, Plaintiffs' Opening Brief does not
contain an "argument" section, as mandated by HRAP Rule 28(b)(7).

4II.  STANDARD OF REVIEW
On appeal, the grant or denial of summary judgment is
reviewed de novo.  See State ex rel. Anzai v. City and
County of Honolulu, 99 Hawai# i 508, [515], 57 P.3d 433,
[440] (2002); Bitney v. Honolulu Police Dep't, 96 Hawai# i
243, 250, 30 P.3d 257, 264 (2001).
[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and
admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if
any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any
material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.  A fact is material if
proof of that fact would have the effect of
establishing or refuting one of the essential elements
of a cause of action or defense asserted by the
parties.  The evidence must be viewed in the light
most favorable to the non-moving party.  In other
words, we must view all of the evidence and inferences
drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the
party opposing the motion.

III.  DISCUSSION
A. 2 RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS §§ 416 & 427
(1965) APPLY TO THESE FACTS PURSUANT TO MAKANEOLE
v. GAMPON, 70 HAW. 501, 777 P.2d 1183 (1989).
Plaintiffs contend the circuit court erred in holding
that the Hawai #i Supreme Court in Makaneole "did not expressly
adopt the [2 Restatement (Second) of Torts], §§ 416 and 427 as
substantive law."6  Plaintiffs argue that Makaneole endorsesNOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(...continued)6
However, we may elect to address the merits of an appeal in spite of
HRAP Rule 28(b) violations.  Clark v. Arakaki, 118 Hawai# i 355, 360 n.5, 191
P.3d 176, 181 n.5 (2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)
(noting a judicial policy of "affording litigants the opportunity to have
their cases heard on the merits, where possible"); O'Conner v. Diocese of
Honolulu, 77 Hawai# i 383, 386 & n.5, 885 P.2d 361, 364 & n.5 (1994) (noting
that HRAP 2 permits the appellate courts to suspend HRAP "[i]n the interest of
expediting decision, or for other good cause shown").  
52 Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 416 and 427 as "a basis for
imputing liability against the employer of an independent
contractor under Hawaii law."
In Makaneole, Kauai Development Corporation (KDC) hired
Dillingham Construction Corporation (DCC) as a general contractor
to oversee the expansion of the Sheraton Kauai Hotel.  70 Haw. at
502, 777 P.2d at 1184.  Makaneole was employed as a carpenter by
DCC.  Id.  The expansion project involved hoisting large plywood
sheets onto the hotel roof via a crane.  Id.  Makaneole's expert
testified that the hotel roof had an unusually steep pitch, which
made the project dangerous.  Id.  
While Makaneole was working on the roof, a part of the
crane struck him and he suffered a head injury.  Id. at 503-04,
777 P.2d at 1185.  Drake Gampon (Gampon) was the crane operator. 
Id. at 503, 777 P.2d at 1184.  Makaneole filed suit, and the
Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit granted directed verdicts in
favor of KDC and Gampon.  70 Haw. at 501, 777 P.2d at 1183. 
Makaneole appealed the directed verdicts to this court, raising
this argument: 
Citing Restatement, §§ 416 and 427, Makaneole also
argues that KDC is vicariously liable for [DCC's] negligence
because (1) KDC should have been aware that the roof design
and its unorthodox method of construction created peculiar
risk of harm to him, and (2) crane operation in construction
is inherently dangerous.
Makaneole v. Gampon, 7 Haw. App. 448, 459, 776 P.2d 402, 409,
rev'd in part and aff'd in part, 70 Haw. 501, 777 P.2d 1183
(1989).  This court reversed the directed verdicts.  70 Haw. atNOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
7  In a subsequent case, the Supreme Court of North Dakota interpreted
Makaneole similarly.  See Fleck v. ANG Coal Gasification Co., 522 N.W.2d 445,
450-51 (N.D. 1994) (noting that Hawai #i under Makaneole follows the minority
view, which holds that §§ 416 and 427 protect employees of independent
contractors).  
6501, 777 P.2d at 1183.  On certiorari, Id. at 502, 777 P.2d at
1184, the Hawai #i Supreme Court stated that this court had erred
in refusing to apply §§ 416 and 427 and in holding that the
workers' compensation statute was the exclusive remedy that
Makaneole would have against his employer.  70 Haw. at 505, 777
P.2d at 1185-86.
The Hawai #i Supreme Court reversed this court's holding
that HRS § 386-5 precludes the applicability of §§ 416 and 427. 
Makaneole, 70 Haw. at 507, 777 P.2d at 1187.  The supreme court
explained that the Hawai #i workers' compensation statutes had
been amended to remove the owner of the premises from the
statutory definition of employer, which amendment exposed the
owner to tort liability.  Id. 
Since the owner of the premises is not an employer,
the owner does not fall within the provisions of HRS § 386-5
which exempts employers from liability to employees.
Accordingly, contrary to the result in [Jones v. Chevron
USA, Inc., 718 P.2d 890 (Wyo. 1986)], the workers'
compensation statutes in the State of Hawaii provide no
basis for disregarding the legal principles laid down in
§§ 416 and 427 of 2 RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS. 
Id. at 507, 777 P.2d at 1187.  After clarifying the applicability
of §§ 416 and 427, the Hawai# i Supreme Court remanded Makaneole's
case to the circuit court for further proceedings in accordance
with the opinion.  70 Haw. at 507, 777 P.2d at 1187.
Makaneole implicitly endorsed §§ 416 and 427 as viable
legal remedies against employers of independent contractors for
work-related injury or death.7
In the instant case, the circuit court erred in
refusing to apply §§ 416 and 427 under Makaneole on summaryNOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
7judgment.  Under the de novo standard of review, we apply §§ 416
and 427 to these facts.  
B. A MATERIAL ISSUE OF FACT EXISTS AS TO WHETHER
DIXONS OWED A DUTY OF REASONABLE CARE TO MR. ROTH
UNDER §§ 416 AND 427.
Plaintiffs contend the evidence raises a material issue
of fact as to whether Dixons owed Mr. Roth a duty of care
pursuant to 2 Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 416 and/or 427,
which provide as follows:
§ 416.  Work Dangerous In Absence Of Special Precautions
One who employs an independent contractor to do work
which the employer should recognize as likely to create
during its progress a peculiar risk of physical harm to
others unless special precautions are taken, is subject to
liability for physical harm caused to them by the failure of
the contractor to exercise reasonable care to take such
precautions, even though the employer has provided for such
precautions in the contract or otherwise.
§ 427.  Negligence As To Danger Inherent In The Work
One who employs an independent contractor to do work
involving a special danger to others which the employer
knows or has reason to know to be inherent in or normal to
the work, or which he contemplates or has reason to
contemplate when making the contract, is subject to
liability for physical harm caused to such others by the
contractor's failure to take reasonable precautions against
such danger.
We agree with Plaintiffs.  Viewed in the light most
favorable to Plaintiffs (the non-moving party), the evidence
raised a material issue as to Dixons' duty of care to Mr. Roth
under §§ 416 and 427.  Nuuanu Valley Ass'n, 119 Hawai# i at 96,
194 P.3d at 537.  
It is undisputed that Dixons hired TWI, Mr. Roth's
employer, to cut down and remove gunpowder trees from Dixons'
property.  Dixons initially consulted with an excavation company
about removing the gunpowder trees, but the company refused due
to the close proximity of those particular trees to high-voltage
electrical lines.  The president of TWI admitted that the tree
removal job was conducted in violation of safety directivesNOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
  We need not address Plaintiffs' challenge to the circuit court's8
denial of the Motion for Reconsideration.
8specified in the crane manual.  This evidence raises a material
issue of fact as to Dixons' duty of care to Mr. Roth under §§ 416
and 427. 
IV.  CONCLUSION
Having found a material issue of fact as to Dixons'
legal duty to Mr. Roth, we vacate the Final Judgment filed on
August 27, 2008 in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit and
remand this case for further proceedings.8
