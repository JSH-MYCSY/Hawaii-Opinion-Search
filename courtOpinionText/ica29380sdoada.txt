IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
MAY L. ELDER, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
CHRISTOPHER R. ELDER, Defendant-Appellee,
and
 
LIONEL M. RILEY, Real Party in Interest-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D NO. 07-1-0239)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Real Party in Interest-Appellant Lionel M. Riley
 
(Riley) appeals the Order Awarding Attorney's Fees filed on
 
August 22, 2008 in the District Family Court of the Third Circuit
(family court)1
 ordering Riley and his former client, Plaintiff
May L. Elder, jointly and severally, to pay Defendant

 
Christopher R. Elder's attorney's fees in the amount of Two-
Thousand Three-Hundred and Sixty Dollars ($2,360).
 
On appeal, Riley contends that the family court erred
 
in ordering him to pay attorney's fees without giving him proper
 
notice and thereby denying Riley a fair opportunity to be heard.

 
Upon a careful review of the record and the Opening
2
Brief,  and having given due consideration to the arguments
advanced and the issues raised in this appeal, because the family
 
court's basis for awarding attorney's fees against Riley is
 
unclear, the notice provided to Riley was inconsistent with how
 
the issue was apparently addressed, and the family court did not

make a specific finding of bad faith as to Riley, the family
 
court erred in awarding sanctions of attorney's fees against
 
Riley.
 
I. Background
 
Riley is the former attorney for Plaintiff Elder in
 
this divorce case, docketed as FC-D 07-1-239 in the family court. 
At a hearing on April 21, 2008 in related case FC-D 08-1-0086,3
 
the family court set an order to show cause hearing to address
 its concerns that: (1) the Complaint for Divorce filed on
 
September 11, 2007 in FC-D 07-1-239 and signed by Plaintiff May
4
Elder appeared to contain material misrepresentations;  and (2) a
Notice of Dismissal filed by Riley on March 27, 2008 in

 
FC-D 07-1-239 was improperly filed pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1)(A)
 of the Hawai
'i Family Court Rules.5 At the April 21, 2008 
hearing, the family court stated:
 
For all of those reasons, Mr. Riley, the Court . . .
will set an order to show cause hearing with respect to both
your client in her individual capacity, and you for the
following reasons. One, the complaint for divorce and the
pleadings -- the initial pleadings in FC-D 07-1-239 appear
to the Court to contain material misrepresentations. The

 Because the two cases, FC-D 07-1-239 and FC-D 08-1-0086, involve the
same parties and issues, and are therefore related, we take judicial notice ofrelevant filings and transcripts of hearings in FC-D 08-1-0086. See Roxas v. 
Marcos, 89 Hawai' i 91, 110 n.9, 969 P.2d 1209, 1228 n.9 (1998); Peters v.
Aipa, 118 Hawai' i 308, 312 n.3, 188 P.3d 822, 826 n.3 (Haw. 2008). The case 
designated as FC-D 08-1-0086 was initiated after the Notice of Dismissal wasfiled in this case, FC-D 07-1-239. A subsequent hearing on June 16, 2008 washeld with regard to both FC-D 07-1-239 and FC-D 08-1-0086. 
4
 The concern with the Complaint for Divorce filed September 11, 2007
was that the Plaintiff, under penalty of perjury, averred that she or herspouse had lived or been physically present in Hawaii for a continuous periodof at least six months and that she had lived and/or been physically presenton the Island of Hawai' i for a continuous period of at least three months,
while at the same time a Matrimonial Action Information form filed the same date indicated the Plaintiff had resided in Hawaii only from August 10, 2007. 
5
 The concern was that the Notice of Dismissal was improper and
ineffective because the defendant's counsel had already made an appearance in
court and thus HFCR Rule 41(a)(1)(A) did not apply to effectuate a proper
dismissal.
 
2
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
complaint in that action is signed by the Plaintiff and not
signed by you, Mr. Riley.
 
The order to show cause with regard to you, Mr. Riley,
has to do with the Notice of Dismissal filed in 07-1-239.
 
On May 16, 2008, in FC-D No. 08-1-0086, the family
 
court issued Riley a Notice to Appear requiring him to appear
 
before the family court on June 16, 2008 "to show cause why you
 
should not be held in contempt for violating Rule 41, Hawaii
 
Family Court Rules."6
 
At the hearing on June 16, 2008, Plaintiff Elder had
 
new counsel and Riley appeared pursuant to the Notice to Appear. 
During the hearing, the only basis for sanctions of attorney's
 
fees that was raised by the family court was the filing of the
 
Complaint for Divorce, which had been signed by Plaintiff Elder. 
The family court initiated the discussion about attorney's fees
 
by stating:
 
Now with regard to the remaining matter, and frankly I
do believe that the filing of the initial action in the
divorce case 07-1-239 was done in bad faith. And am
 interested, Mr. De Lima, in frankly finding out from whom
Mr. Elder ought to receive the fees and costs he incurred in
that action. Because that is what I intend to award.
 
Mr. Riley, I know this places you in an awkward
position with your former client, but it -
Mr. De Lima, I will note that the complaint for
divorce in 07-1-239 is signed by Miss Elder and not signed
by Mr. Riley. So I think the burden is on your client to
establish why she should not be sanctioned.
 
Plaintiff's new counsel argued Riley prepared the forms
 
and told Plaintiff what to sign. Riley also stated that he did
 
not believe Plaintiff Elder should be sanctioned. Without any
 
discussion about the Notice of Dismissal filed pursuant to Rule
 
41, the family court stated it would impose a sanction against
 
Plaintiff Elder and Riley, jointly and severally, awarding
 
6
 Because there was no prior order of the family court that Riley is
alleged to have violated, we do not address this case as involving a question
of "contempt."

   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
attorney's fees and costs accrued by Defendant Elder in FC-D 07­
1-239.
 
The Order Awarding Attorney's Fees filed on August 22,
 
2008, does not set out any findings to describe the misconduct
 
upon which the sanction is based. Rather, it just briefly
 
states:
 
The Court finds that it is additionally appropriate to grant
[Defendant] Christopher R. Elder's request for attorneys'
fees he unnecessarily incurred in this action under Haw. R.
Civ. P. 11, and the Court's inherent powers as restated in
Haw. Rev. Stat. § 603-21.9(6). Mr. Elder is, therefore,
awarded attorney's fees, jointly and severally against
Plaintiff May L. Elder and Lionel M. Riley, Esq., in the
amount of $2,360.00.

II. Standard of Review
 
This court reviews a trial court's order imposing 
sanctions, whether under Rule 11 or pursuant to the trial court's 
inherent powers, under the abuse of discretion standard. Enos v. 
Pac. Transfer & Warehouse, Inc., 79 Hawai 'i 452, 459 n.7, 903 
P.2d 1273, 1280 n.7 (1995). 
III. Discussion
 
As apparently recognized by the family court at the 
hearing on April 21, 2008, Rule 11 cannot be the basis for the 
award of attorney's fees against Riley because he did not sign 
the Complaint for Divorce in FC-D 07-1-239. See Enos, 79 Hawai 'i 
at 457, 903 P.2d at 1278 ("the purpose of Rule 11 as a whole is to bring home to the individual signer his [or her] personal, 
nondelegable responsibility[,]" and thus an attorney who did not 
sign the pleading in question could not be sanctioned under Rule 
11 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure) (citations omitted). 
7
 The references to the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure and Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 603-21.9(6) are incorrect as those provisions apply
to the circuit court. The appropriate authorities for the district familycourt would be Rule 11 of the Hawai' i Family Court Rules and § HRS 571-8.5(10)
(2006).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The basis for any sanctions against Riley in this case
 
must therefore flow from the family court's inherent authority
 
and a determination that Riley engaged in bad faith conduct
 
related to (1) the Notice of Dismissal Riley filed in FC-D 07-1­
239, or (2) the filing of the Complaint for Divorce. 
While the family court has the inherent authority to 
sanction parties and award attorney's fees in appropriate 
circumstances, the Hawai 'i Supreme Court has cautioned that such 
authority "should be exercised with restraint and discretion." Id. at 458, 903 P.2d at 1279 (citations omitted). The Hawai
'i 
Supreme Court has further recognized that "a particularized showing of bad faith is required to justify the use of the 
court's inherent power" and that "an order imposing sanctions 
should set forth findings that describe, with reasonable 
specificity, the perceived misconduct." Id. at 458-59, 903 P.2d 
at 1279-80. 
Here, the family court made no findings as to Riley's
 
misconduct and there is no particularized showing of bad faith
 supporting the sanction against Riley. We must therefore review
 
the record to determine if there has been an abuse of discretion. 
Id. at 459, 903 P.2d at 1280. While there were legitimate
 
reasons for the family court to be concerned about and to
 
question Riley's conduct in this litigation, the record does not
 
establish sufficient evidence of bad faith conduct by Riley to
 
impose sanctions. With regard to the Notice of Dismissal,
 
opposing defense counsel had encouraged Riley to voluntarily
 
dismiss FC-D 07-1-239. The family court's concern appears to
 
have been that, because defense counsel had already made an
 
appearance in court, the proper procedure was not simply a Notice
 
of Dismissal but rather a stipulation of dismissal to be approved
 
by the court. While ill-advised, it does not appear that Riley's
 
action in filing the Notice of Dismissal was "taken for reasons
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of harassment or delay or for other improper purposes." Id. at
 
458, 903 P.2d at 1279 (quoting United States v. Int'l Bhd. of
 
Teamsters, 948 F.2d 1338, 1345 (2d Cir. 1991)). 
If the basis for the sanction against Riley was his
 
involvement in preparing the Complaint for Divorce, the Notice to
 
Appear was flawed because it only notified Riley that he was to
 
address a violation of Rule 41. Further, the record fails to
 
provide a sufficient factual basis as to Riley's conduct
 
regarding the Complaint for Divorce. At most, there was a brief
 
discussion by counsel at the June 16, 2008 hearing, but there was
 
no evidence submitted by any of the parties and no findings by
 
the family court.
 
Based on the foregoing, the family court abused its
 
discretion in awarding attorney's fees against Riley and we
 
reverse the Order Awarding Attorney's Fees filed on August 22,
 
2008, to the extent it pertains to Riley.
