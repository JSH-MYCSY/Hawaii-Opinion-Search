EDWIN W. DELANEY, Claimant-Appellant, v.
IMMANUEL ENTERPRISES, LTD. dba: ELEPHANT WALK, and
WORKCOMP HAWAI' I INSURANCE CO., INC./FIRST INSURANCE
COMPANY OF HAWAI' I, LTD., Employer/Insurance Carrier/

SPECIAL COMPENSATION FUND, Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
(CASE NO. AB 2006-224(M); (7-05-00274))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
In this workers' compensation case, Claimant-Appellant
 
Edwin W. Delaney (Delaney) appeals from the August 26, 2008
 
Decision and Order filed by the Labor and Industrial Relations
 
Appeals Board (LIRAB) affirming the decision of the Director of
 
the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations (Director). On
 
appeal, Delaney maintains that the LIRAB erred in finding that a
 
work-related injury, occurring on December 24, 2004, resulted in
 
only a temporary aggravation of a preexisting lower back
 
condition and in concluding that Delaney was not entitled to
 
further medical care and temporary total disability (TTD)
 
benefits and that no permanent disability resulted from the
 
injury.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Delaney raises the following points of error on appeal:
 
(1) The LIRAB erred in entering Finding of Fact (FOF)
 
48, which, relying on Dr. Mihara's report, found that the
 
December 24, 2004 accident resulted in a temporary aggravation of
 
Delaney's preexisting low back condition, the accident did not
 
cause the L3-4 disc protrusion seen on the January 21, 2005 MRI
 
scan, and Delaney did not require further medical treatment. 
(2) The LIRAB erred in Conclusion of Law (COL) 1, when
 
it concluded that after August 16, 2005, Delaney is not entitled
 to medical care, services, and supplies for the December 24, 2004
 
injury. 
(3) The LIRAB erred in COL 2, when it concluded that
 
after August 30, 2005, Delaney is not entitled to TTD benefits
 
for the December 24, 2004 injury. 
(4) The LIRAB erred in COL 3, when it concluded that
 
the December 24, 2004 injury did not result in permanent
 
disability.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve
 
Delaney's contentions as follows:
 
(1) Delaney's first argument on appeal challenges FOF
 
48, which provides:
 
48. Based on the Board's review of the record,
including the degenerative findings at the L3-4 level in the
January 21, 2005 MRI, and for the reasons stated in Dr.
Mihara's report, the Board credits the opinion of Dr. Mihara
over that of Dr. Rogers to find that [Delaney] sustained a
lumbar strain or sprain on December 24, 2004 that resulted
in a temporary aggravation of his preexisting low back
condition and that the L3-4 disc protrusion seen on the
January 21, 2005 MRI did not result from the December 24,
2004 lifting incident.
 
The Board further finds that by July 22, 2005, the
date of Dr. Mihara's report, [Delaney] had returned to pre-
injury status and did not require further medical treatment
for the December 24, 2004 lumbar strain or sprain injury.
 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"Ordinarily, deference will be given to decisions of 
administrative agencies acting within the realm of their 
expertise." Coon v. City & County of Honolulu, 98 Hawai' i 233, 
245, 47 P.3d 348, 360 (2002) (internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets omitted). Furthermore, "the credibility 
of witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony are 
within the province of the trier of fact and, generally, will not 
be disturbed on appeal." Tamashiro v. Control Specialist, Inc., 
97 Hawai' i 86, 92, 34 P.3d 16, 22 (2001) (citations omitted). 
Considering the record as a whole, the LIRAB's FOF 48 
is supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. In other words, there is credible evidence of sufficient quality 
and probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to 
support a conclusion that Delaney suffered a lumbar strain on 
December 24, 2004 and had since returned to pre-injury status. 
See In re Water Use Permit Applications, 94 Hawai' i at 119, 9 
P.3d at 431 (citing definition of "substantial evidence"). 
For example, in addition to showing a disc herniation
 
at the L3-4 level, a January 21, 2005 MRI also showed
 degenerative facet joint changes and degenerative disc disease at
 
the L3-4 level. The language of FOF 48 itself indicates that the
 
LIRAB considered these degenerative findings a relevant factor in
 
determining that the December 24, 2004 injury did not cause the
 
disc protrusion. 
The LIRAB also found in unchallenged FOFs 42 and 43
 
that Delaney was inconsistent in describing his injury, symptoms,
 
and pain medication use to his various treating physicians and in
 
his testimony. For instance, Delaney testified that the pain he
 
felt in his left leg after the December 24, 2004 injury was down
 
the front of his leg. The medical record indicates, however,
 
that on January 3, 2005, and January 6, 2005, while being
 
evaluated by Dr. Adams and Dr. Schnyder, respectively, Delaney
 
described the pain as occurring down the back of his left leg. 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Delaney experienced similar pain down the back of his left leg 
prior to the December 24, 2004 injury and required daily pain 
medication for low back and leg pain for at least six months 
prior. Indeed, Delaney was prescribed Vicodin for chronic back 
pain with "radicular symptoms" approximately one month prior to 
the December 24, 2004 injury. The LIRAB's unchallenged findings 
regarding Delaney's inconsistent statements support its decision 
to credit, at least in part, Dr. Mihara's report. See Okada 
Trucking Co., Ltd. v. Bd. of Water Supply, 97 Hawai' i 450, 458, 
40 P.3d 73, 81 (2002) ("Findings of fact . . . that are not 
challenged on appeal are binding on the appellate court."). As 
the trier of fact, the LIRAB was free to make its own 
determination regarding the credibility of Delaney's testimony, 
Dr. Mihara's report, and Dr. Rogers's opinion, as well as the 
weight accorded to conflicting evidence at trial. See Tamashiro, 
97 Hawai' i at 92, 34 P.3d at 22.
 We are not persuaded by Delaney's argument that the
 
LIRAB improperly credited Dr. Mihara's opinion over that of Dr.
 Rogers because Dr. Mihara's report was based on two erroneous
 
assumptions: (1) the box of glass panes weighed only ten pounds;
 
and (2) Delaney did not lift the box but simply carried it. 
Specifically, Delaney maintains that these two assumptions are
 
directly inconsistent with FOF 1, which provides: "On December
 
24, 2004, [Delaney], a retail store manager, carried a 24 to 30
 
lb. box of glass panes from the store to his supervisor's car
 
parked about 50 feet away. [Delaney] injured his low back while
 
loading the box of glass panes into the car." Delaney's argument
 
presumes that Dr. Mihara's report relied exclusively on the two
 
aforementioned assumptions and, thus, should be disregarded in
 
its entirety. A careful review of Dr. Mihara's report, however,
 
indicates that Dr. Mihara did not exclusively rely on either
 
assumption. When viewed in context, Dr. Mihara's assumption
 
regarding the weight of the box was made in direct response to a
 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
specific question posed by Immanuel's attorney and does not
 
represent a comprehensive culmination of Dr. Mihara's analysis. 
The portion of Dr. Mihara's report that summarizes his findings
 
clearly indicates that Dr. Mihara formed his medical opinion-Â­
i.e. that Delaney temporarily aggravated a preexisting condition
 
on December 24, 2004--after he had (1) physically examined
 
Delaney; (2) questioned Delaney about the injury, his symptoms,
 
and his pain medication use; (3) extensively reviewed Delaney's
 
medical history records; and (4) reviewed various other documents
 
including Deborah Swift's (Swift) affidavit. Accordingly,
 
although Dr. Mihara's report makes clear that he believed Swift's
 
affidavit that no lifting injury occurred on December 24, 2004,
 
such an assumption was not the sole basis for Dr. Mihara's
 
opinion. Dr. Mihara also specifically noted his reliance on Dr.
 
Adams's evaluation of Delaney on January 3, 2005, after which Dr.
 
Adams diagnosed a lumbar sprain and released Delaney to modified
 
work. 
Moreover, the LIRAB did not rely exclusively on Dr. 
Mihara's report in finding that the December 24, 2004 accident 
resulted in a temporary aggravation of Delaney's preexisting low 
back condition, that the accident did not cause the L3-4 disc 
protrusion seen on the January 21, 2005 MRI, and that Delaney did 
not require further medical treatment. Even if Dr. Mihara's 
report contained improper assumptions, we find no support for 
requiring the LIRAB to reject the report in its entirety. The 
plain language of FOF 48 itself clearly indicates that the 
LIRAB's findings and conclusions were not a blanket adoption of 
Dr. Mihara's report in its entirety; rather, its determination 
was also "[b]ased on the Board's review of the record[.]" 
Again, "the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given 
their testimony are within the province of the trier of fact and, 
generally, will not be disturbed on appeal." Tamashiro, 97 
Hawai'i at 92, 34 P.3d at 22 (citations omitted). 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Accordingly, the LIRAB's finding that the December 24,
 
2004 accident resulted in a temporary aggravation of Delaney's
 
preexisting low back condition, that the accident did not cause
 
the L3-4 disc protrusion seen on the January 21, 2005 MRI, and
 
that Delaney did not require further medical treatment, was not
 
clearly erroneous.
 
(2), (3) & (4) Delaney also challenges the LIRAB's
 
COLs 1, 2 and 3, which conclude, inter alia, that: (1) Delaney
 
is not entitled to medical care, services, and supplies after
 
August 16, 2005; (2) Delaney is not entitled to TTD benefits
 
after August 30, 2005; and (3) Delaney's injury did not result in
 
permanent disability. 
"[A] conclusion of law will not be overturned if 
supported by the trial court's findings of fact and by the 
application of the correct rule of law." Tamashiro, 97 Hawai' i 
at 93, 34 P.3d at 23 (citation omitted). The only finding challenged by Delaney is FOF 48, which is not clearly erroneous. 
Delaney does not challenge FOFs 40, 41, or 49, which find no 
evidence of permanent impairment, disfigurement, or permanent 
disability. Findings of fact that are not challenged on appeal 
are binding on the appellate court. Okada Trucking Co., 97 
Hawai'i at 458, 40 P.3d at 81; Moi v. State, Dept. of Public 
Safety, 118 Hawai' i 239, 245, 188 P.3d 753, 759 (App. 2008). The 
LIRAB's findings that Delaney had returned to pre-injury status and that there was no evidence of permanent disability support 
the LIRAB's related COLs. 
Delaney argues that the LIRAB failed to properly impose
 
upon a statutory presumption of compensability pursuant to HRS
 
Â§ 386-85(1) (1993). Although Delaney fails to explain this
 
argument or tie it to the record in this case, this argument
 
apparently rests on Delaney's argument that LIRAB should have
 
disregarded or discredited Dr. Mihara's testimony. However, the
 
LIRAB properly considered Delaney's evidence and arguments on
 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
this point, as well as the evidence of Delaney's condition before
 
and after the December 24, 2004 event, the lack of evidence of a
 
traumatic event, the evidence of degenerative disc disease and
 
degenerative changes at L3-4, Dr. Mihara's medical opinion of a
 
temporary aggravation, and concluded that the incident did not
 
cause a permanent injury.
 
Delaney presents no other argument that the LIRAB 
misapplied the relevant workers' compensation laws in reaching 
its conclusions of law. We have recognized that "[a]n appellate 
court need not address matters as to which the appellant has 
failed to present a discernible argument." International Sav. 
and Loan Ass'n, Ltd. v. Carbonel, 93 Hawai' i 464, 473, 5 P.3d 
454, 463 (App. 2000); Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 
28(b)(7); see also Ala Moana Boat Owners' Ass'n v. State, 50 Haw. 156, 158, 434 P.2d 516 (1967); Citicorp Mortgage, Inc. v. 
Bartolome, 94 Hawai' i 422, 433, 16 P.3d 827, 838 (2000).
 Thus, we conclude that the LIRAB did not err in
 
concluding that Delaney was not entitled to further medical and
 
TTD benefits and that no permanent disability resulted from the
 
December 24, 2004 injury.
 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the LIRAB's August
 
26, 2008 Decision and Order.
