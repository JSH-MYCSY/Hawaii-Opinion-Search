IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
GLENN T. MABSON, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 07-1-0327(4))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Glenn T. Mabson (Mabson) appeals
 
from the September 5, 2008 judgment in the Circuit Court of the
 
1
 Second Circuit (circuit court), in which he was convicted of
Theft in the Second Degree, in violation of Hawaii Revised
 
Statutes (HRS) § 708-831 (Supp. 2010) and Welfare Fraud, in
 
violation of HRS § 346-34(b) (Supp. 2010).
 
On appeal, Mabson contends that the circuit court
 
reversibly erred in failing to sua sponte instruct the jury on
 
the "mistake of fact" defense under HRS § 702-218 (1993)2 as to
 
1
 The Honorable Richard T. Bissen, Jr., presided.

 HRS § 702-218 provides:
 
Ignorance or mistake as a defense.  In any prosecution for
an offense, it is a defense that the accused engaged in the
prohibited conduct under ignorance or mistake of fact if:
 
(1) The ignorance or mistake negatives the state of mind
required to establish an element of the offense; or
(continued...)
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the welfare fraud charge and the "claim of right" defense under
 
3
HRS § 708-834 (1993)  as to the second degree theft charge.
Allegations of erroneous jury instructions alleged on 
appeal but not raised below receive harmless error review.4 
State v. Nichols, 111 Hawai' i 327, 337, 141 P.3d 974, 984 (2006). 
Appellate courts "will vacate, without regard to whether timely 
objection was made, if there is a reasonable possibility that the 
error contributed to the defendant's conviction, i.e., that the 
erroneous jury instruction was not harmless beyond a reasonable 
doubt." Id. 
As to whether and when a trial court is obligated to 
give a jury instruction on a potential defense where the 
defendant has not requested the instruction, the Hawai' i Supreme 
Court has last opined in State v. Stenger, 122 Hawai' i 271, 226 
2(...continued)
(2)	 The law defining the offense or a law related thereto
provides that the state of mind established by such
ignorance or mistake constitutes a defense.
 
3	 HRS § 708-834 provides, in relevant part:
 
Defenses: unawareness of ownership; claim of right;
household belongings; co-interest not a defense.  (1) It is
a defense to a prosecution for theft that the defendant:
 
(a)	 Was unaware that the property or service was
that of another; or
 
(b)	 Believed that the defendant was entitled to the
 property or services under a claim of right or
that the defendant was authorized, by the owner
or by law, to obtain or exert control as the
defendant did.
 
. . . .
 
(4) In a prosecution for theft, it is not a defense
that the defendant has an interest in the property if the
owner has an interest in the property to which the defendant
is not entitled.

 "[A]lthough as a general matter forfeited assignments of error are
to be reviewed under the [Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP)] Rule 52(b)
plain error standard of review, in the case of erroneous jury instructions,that standard of review is effectively merged with the HRPP Rule 52(a)harmless error standard of review because it is the duty of the circuit courtto properly instruct the jury." Nichols, 111 Hawai' i at 337, 141 P.3d at 984.

P.3d 441 (2010). In interpreting the several opinions in
 
Stenger, this court has articulated the following standard:
 
[A] trial court has a duty to sua sponte instruct the jury
on a particular defense if: "(1) it appears that thedefendant is relying on such a defense, or (2) if there issubstantial evidence supportive of such a defense and thedefense is not inconsistent with the defendant's theory ofthe case." 122 Hawai' i at 299, 226 P.3d at 469 (Moon, C.J.,
dissenting); id. at 281, 226 P.3d at 451 (Acoba, J.); id. at296-97, 226 P.3d at 466-67 (Kim, J., concurring). 
State v. Yue, 124 Hawai' i 196, 238 P.3d 723, 2010 WL 3705983, at 
*3, No. 29141 (App. Sept. 23, 2010)(SDO). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Mabson's points of error as follows:
 
(1) Mabson argues that the circuit court reversibly
 
erred in failing to sua sponte instruct the jury on the HRS
 
§ 702-218 "mistake of fact" defense as to the welfare fraud
 
charge. The undisputed facts in the record reveal that Mabson
 
admitted that he was the only party to the Costco lawsuit and
 
that he directed his attorney to deposit the settlement check,
 
made out to Mabson personally, in the Epileptic Foundation of
 
Maui ("EFM") bank account. Evidence showed that no one other
 
than Mabson decided what to do with the settlement check and
 
Mabson was the only person who accessed the funds during the
 
relevant periods. Especially noteworthy is the undisputed fact
 
that Mabson opened a new American Savings Bank account shortly
 
before receiving the settlement funds, into which he directed his
 
attorney to place these funds, and from which Mabson withdrew
 
$20,000 in four certified cashier's checks, each made out to
 
Mabson personally. In light of these undisputed facts, it was
 
not plain error to withhold a mistake of fact instruction.
 
Additionally, we cannot say that Mabson relied on the
 
mistake of fact defense he now asserts on appeal. See Yue, 2010
 
WL 3705983, at *3. While Mabson asserts that a mistake of fact
 argument "constituted the thrust of [his counsel's] closing
 
argument" at trial, this characterization is not supported by the
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
record. Mabson's closing argument, and his defense as a whole,
 
focused on the notion that he did not personally benefit from the
 
Costco settlement money, which Mabson's counsel labeled a
 
"donation" from Mabson to the EFM, not that he did not have
 
access to it, or that he did not believe he had access to it.
 
Mabson also argues on appeal that his alleged mistaken
 
belief regarding his access to the funds was an aspect of his
 
defense, insofar as he claims he thought EFM was substituted in
 
his stead as the plaintiff in his suit against Costco. However,
 
Mabson testified that EFM "weren't exactly a party" although he
 
believed his injury also caused EFM to suffer loss. As discussed
 
previously, Mabson's testimony revealed that he directed the
 
placement of the settlement funds in EFM accounts and controlled
 
the flow of those funds in and out of the EFM accounts. Given
 
these admissions, it cannot be said that at trial he relied on a
 
defense claiming he did not know he had access to or control over
 
the same funds.
 
(2) Mabson also argues that he was entitled to a jury 
instruction regarding the defense of "claim of right" under HRS 
§ 708-834 as to the second degree theft charge. In response, the 
State essentially agreed with Mabson based on this court's 
decision in State v. Stenger, 119 Hawai' i 336, 197 P.3d 788, 2008 
WL 5413898, No. 27511 (App. Dec. 31, 2008)(SDO). After the parties submitted briefs, the Hawai' i Supreme Court reversed the 
ICA holding. In light of the supreme court's holding that claim of right cannot be used as a defense to welfare benefits theft,
5 
Mabson was not entitled to a jury instruction on the claim of 
5
 The supreme court explained that a claim of right defense must
encompass some form of pre-existing ownership or possession of specific
property. Because a claim of entitlement to welfare benefits amounts to nothing more than a claim that general money is owed, a defendant charged withtheft of welfare benefits cannot claim ownership rights in any specificproperty. Stenger, 122 Hawai' i at 286-88, 226 P.3d at 456-58.

right defense. See Stenger, 122 Hawai' i at 283-89, 226 P.3d at 
453-59.
 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the judgment entered on
 
September 5, 2008 in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit is
 affirmed.
