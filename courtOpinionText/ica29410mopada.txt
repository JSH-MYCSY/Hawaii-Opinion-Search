 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
1
07-1-0456 and 07-1-0457  on October 6, 2008 in the Circuit Court
2
of the First Circuit  (circuit court).  Pursuant to the April 22, 
2008 "Order Affirming Agency-Appellee Hawaii Labor Relations 
Board's Order Nos. 2424 and 2425 Dated February 8, 2007," the 
circuit court entered judgment in favor of Respondents/Appellees-
Appellees Robert Watada (Watada), Chairperson, Wai 'alae School 
Board, Wai 'alae Elementary School; the State of Hawai 'i (the 
State); the School; and Jonathan A. Swanson (Swanson), State of 
Hawai'i Deputy Attorney General; and Agency/Appellee-Appellee 
Hawaii Labor Relations Board (HLRB) and against UPW. 
On appeal, UPW contends the circuit court erred 
(1) "by its refusal to reverse [the HLRB] which
 
violated its mandate under HRS § 89-14 [(1993)] to exercise
 'exclusive original jurisdiction' over prohibited practices not
 
decided by an arbitrator";
 
(2) "by affirming [HLRB] orders which are 'affected by 
error of law' because the arbitrator declined to consider and 
decide the statutory issues against either" the School or the 
State of Hawai
'i Department of Education (DOE); and 
(3) "when it declined to reverse the [HLRB] for its
 
failure to follow established case precedent under [Spielberg
 
Mfg. Co., 112 N.L.R.B. 1080 (1955),] and its deferral procedure."
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
UPW is the exclusive bargaining representative of blue-
collar, non-supervisory employees in bargaining Unit 1. UPW and 
the State of Hawai 'i are parties to a collective bargaining 
Unit 1 Agreement (CBA), which sets forth a grievance procedure for addressing disputes that arise out of the CBA. The CBA was 
in effect from July 1, 1999 to June 30, 2003 and was extended to 
June 30, 2005. 
1
 Civil Nos. 07-1-0456 and 07-1-0457 were consolidated by the circuit
court on July 16, 2007.

 The Honorable Sabrina S. McKenna presided.

On December 15, 2003, the DOE notified UPW and 
cafeteria employees in Unit 1 assigned to the School that the 
cafeteria at the School would close in four days. On 
December 23, 2004, UPW filed a prohibited practice complaint 
before the HLRB over the closure of the cafeteria and the 
displacement of Unit 1 employees. The parties negotiated a 
settlement culminating in the March 3, 2004 "Memorandum of 
Agreement Between State of Hawaii Department of Education, the 
Wai'alae Elementary School, and the United Public Workers" 
(Settlement Agreement). The Settlement Agreement obligated the School to purchase school meals from the DOE through Anuenue 
Elementary School.
 Because Watada refused to sign off on the Settlement
 
Agreement, on March 24, 2004, UPW filed a Prohibited Practice
 
Complaint against Watada, the School, and Swanson (collectively,
 
558 Respondents) before the HLRB in Case No. CE-01-558. UPW
 
alleged that the refusal of the 558 Respondents to sign the
 
Settlement Agreement amounted to a refusal to bargain in good
 
faith in violation of HRS § 89-13(a) (Supp. 2009). On June 30,
 
2004, the HLRB granted UPW's motion for summary judgment and
 
ordered that Watada and the School shall cease and desist from
 
repudiating the Settlement Agreement and shall execute and
 
implement the Settlement Agreement (HLRB Order No. 2264 in Case
 
No. CE-01-558). On April 28, 2005, UPW filed a motion to enforce
 
HLRB Order No. 2264 in Case No. CE-01-558. On May 17, 2005, the
 
HLRB joined the DOE as a party to the proceeding.
 
In the meantime, on March 28, 2005, UPW filed another
 
Prohibited Practice Complaint before the HLRB against Watada and
 
Patricia Hamamoto (Hamamoto), the DOE Superintendent,
 
(collectively, 594 Respondents) in Case No. CE-01-594 for
 
Respondents' alleged failure to provide complete information in
 
response to UPW's requests. UPW alleged that this failure
 
amounted to violations of HRS § 89-13(a). UPW thereafter amended
 
its complaint in CE-01-594 to reflect that "information provided
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to UPW to date by [594 Respondents] indicate[s] that respondents
 
have wilfully failed to comply with the terms and provisions of
 
the March 3, 2004 [Settlement Agreement]."
 
UPW moved to defer the prohibited practices alleged in
 
both Case No. CE-01-558 and Case No. CE-01-594 to arbitration. 
The HLRB granted the motions.
 Finding no agreement to arbitrate grievances between
 
the School and UPW, Arbitrator Uesato (Uesato) dismissed the
 
School from the arbitration. UPW subsequently, on March 8, 2006,
 
filed a motion in each case to reopen proceedings between UPW and
 
Watada/the School. On February 8, 2007, HLRB denied each motion
 
in HLRB Order Nos. 2424 (CE-01-558) and 2425 (CE-01-594).
 
UPW timely filed a notice of appeal to the circuit
 
court in each case, challenging HLRB Order Nos. 2424 (Civ. No.
 
07-1-0456) and 2425 (Civ. No. 07-1-0457). The circuit court
 
consolidated the cases.
 
On December 18, 2007, Uesato issued his final award as
 
to the remaining parties (not including Watada and the School) in
 
the arbitration proceedings. The DOE filed a special proceeding
 
to confirm Uesato's award and UPW, in the same proceeding, filed
 
a motion to confirm in part, vacate in part, and modify or
 
correct in part the award. By orders dated March 10 and
 
March 18, 2008, in the special proceeding, the circuit court
 
vacated Uesato's dismissal of the School and remanded the case to
 
Uesato for further arbitration proceedings as to the School. The
 
circuit court also affirmed the arbitration award as to the DOE,
 
but authorized Uesato to modify the remedy as to the DOE if
 
Uesato determined that such modification was appropriate
 
following the arbitration with the School.
 
The circuit court held a hearing on March 17, 2008
 
regarding the two consolidated civil cases and on April 22, 2008,
 
filed its Order Affirming Agency-Appellee [HLRB's] Order Nos.
 
2424 and 2425 Dated February 8, 2007. On September 16, 2008, the
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
circuit court denied UPW's motion for reconsideration of the
 
order affirming the HLRB orders. This timely appeal followed.
 
II. 	STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
A.	 Administrative Agency Decisions-Secondary Appeals
 
Review of a decision made by the circuit court upon
its review of an agency's decision is a secondary
appeal. The standard of review is one in which [the
appellate] court must determine whether the circuit
court was right or wrong in its decision, applying the
standards set forth in HRS § 91-14(g) [(1993)] to the
agency's decision.
 
Korean Buddhist Dae Won Sa Temple of Hawai' i v. Sullivan, 87 
Hawai'i 217, 229, 953 P.2d 1315, 1327 (1998) (quoting Bragg 
v. State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins., 81 Hawai' i 302, 304, 916
P.2d 1203, 1205 (1996)) (alteration in original). HRS § 91-14, entitled "Judicial review of contested cases,"provides in relevant part: 
(g) Upon review of the record the court may
affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case
with instructions for further proceedings; or it may
reverse or modify the decision and order if the
substantial rights of the petitioners may have been
prejudiced because the administrative findings,
conclusions, decisions, or orders are:
 
(1)	 In violation of constitutional or
 statutory provisions; or
 
(2)	 In excess of the statutory authority or
jurisdiction of the agency; or
 
(3)	 Made upon unlawful procedure; or
 
(4)	 Affected by other error of law; or
 
(5)	 Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,
probative, and substantial evidence on the
whole record; or
 
(6)	 Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized
by abuse of discretion or clearly
unwarranted exercise of discretion.
 
"[U]nder HRS § 91-14(g), conclusions of law are reviewableunder subsections (1), (2), and (4); questions regardingprocedural defects under subsection (3); findings of factunder subsection (5); and an agency's exercise of discretion
under subsection (6)." In re Hawaiian Elec. Co., 81 Hawai' i

County of Honolulu, 114 Hawai 'i 184, 193, 159 P.3d 143, 152 
(2007) (some brackets in original and some added). 
B. Statutory Interpretation
 
Questions of statutory interpretation are questions of
law to be reviewed de novo under the right/wrong standard.
 
Our statutory construction is guided by the following
well established principles:
 
our foremost obligation is to ascertain and give
effect to the intention of the legislature, which is
to be obtained primarily from the language contained
in the statute itself. And we must read statutory
language in the context of the entire statute and
construe it in a manner consistent with its purpose.
 
When there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or
indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an expression used
in a statute, an ambiguity exists.
 
In construing an ambiguous statute, the meaning
of the ambiguous words may be sought by examining the
context, with which the ambiguous words, phrases, and
sentences may be compared, in order to ascertain their
true meaning. Moreover, the courts may resort to
extrinsic aids in determining legislative intent. One
 avenue is the use of legislative history as an
interpretive tool.
 
[The appellate] court may also consider the reason and
spirit of the law, and the cause which induced the
legislature to enact it to discover its true meaning.
 
Lingle v. Hawai 'i Gov't Employees Ass'n, AFSCME, Local 152, 107 
Hawai'i 178, 183, 111 P.3d 587, 592 (2005) (internal quotation 
marks, brackets and ellipses omitted) (quoting Guth v. Freeland, 
96 Hawai 'i 147, 149-50, 28 P.3d 982, 984-85 (2001)). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
UPW contends the circuit court erred in affirming HLRB
 
Orders Nos. 2424 and 2425. UPW argues that the HLRB's refusal to
 
reopen and determine the prohibited practice claims after Uesato
 
declined to determine them violates "the clear statutory mandate"
 
of HRS § 89-14. HRS § 89-14 provides: 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
§89-14 Prevention of prohibited practices.  Any
controversy concerning prohibited practices[3] may be
submitted to the [HLRB] in the same manner and with the same
[4]
effect as provided in section 377-9 ; provided that the
[HLRB] shall have exclusive original jurisdiction over such
a controversy except that nothing herein shall preclude (1)
the institution of appropriate proceedings in circuit court
pursuant to section 89-12(e) or (2) the judicial review of
decisions or orders of the [HLRB] in prohibited practice
controversies in accordance with section 377-9 and chapter
91. All references in section 377-9 to "labor organization"
shall include employee organization.
 
(Emphasis and footnotes added.)
 
Watada, the School, and the HLRB argue that the HLRB
 
did exercise exclusive original jurisdiction over the dispute,
 
but, at UPW's request, deferred such jurisdiction to Uesato and
 
3
 HRS § 89-13 (Supp. 2009) defines prohibited practices. It provides
in relevant part:
 
§89-13 Prohibited practices; evidence of bad faith.  (a) It
shall be a prohibited practice for a public employer or its
designated representative wilfully to:
 
(1)	 Interfere, restrain, or coerce any employee in the
exercise of any right guaranteed under this chapter;
 
. . . . 
(3)	 Discriminate in regard to hiring, tenure, or any term
or condition of employment to encourage or discourage
membership in any employee organization;
 
. . . .
 
(5)	 Refuse to bargain collectively in good faith with the
exclusive representative as required in section 89-9;
 
(6)	 Refuse to participate in good faith in the mediation
and arbitration procedures set forth in section 89-11; 
(7)	 Refuse or fail to comply with any provision of this
chapter;
 
(8)	 Violate the terms of a collective bargaining
agreement[.]
4
 HRS § 377-9 (1993) provides in relevant part:
 
§377-9 Prevention of unfair labor practices.  (a) Any
controversy concerning unfair labor practices may be submitted to
the [HLRB] in the manner and with the effect provided in this
chapter, but nothing herein shall prevent the pursuit of relief in
courts of competent jurisdiction.
 
(b) Any party in interest may file with the [HLRB] a
written complaint, on a form provided by the [HLRB], charging any
person with having engaged in any specific unfair labor practice.
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
did not retain conditional jurisdiction over the prohibited
 
practice claims against the School. Watada and the School
 
further argue that by determining that the CBA did not apply to
 
the School and thereby dismissing the School from arbitration,
 
Uesato effectively addressed the prohibited practice claims
 
against the School because "the prohibited practice claims
 
against the School are completely reliant upon the existence of
 
underlying contract violations." Watada and the School
 
accordingly explain that "absent a determination that the [CBA]
 
applied to the School at the time that the [Settlement Agreement]
 
was executed and the grievance was filed, any ground for alleging
 
that the School committed a prohibited practice of any kind . . .
 
is baseless."
 
The narrow legal issue presented by this appeal is
 
whether the HLRB's denial of UPW's motions to reopen proceedings
 
as to the School violated HRS § 89-14. 
HRS Chapter 89 is titled "Collective Bargaining in
 
Public Employment." The chapter is intended to establish
 
"guidelines for public employment relations . . .; to provide a
 
rational method for dealing with disputes and work stoppages; and
 
to maintain a favorable political and social environment." HRS
 
§ 89-1(a) (Supp. 2009). To this end, Chapter 89, among others,
 
"creat[es] a labor relations board to administer the provisions
 
of chapters 89 and 377." HRS § 89-1(b)(3) (Supp. 2009).
 
The HLRB is empowered to resolve controversies arising 
under Chapter 89. HRS § 89-5(i)(3) (Supp. 2009); see Jordan v. 
Hawaii Gov't Employees' Ass'n, Local 152, AFSCME, AFL-CIO, 472 F. 
Supp. 1123, 1127 (D. Hawai 'i 1979). HRS § 89-14 vests HLRB with 
"exclusive original jurisdiction" over controversies involving "prohibited practices." 
Chapter 89 also expressly authorizes parties to a
 
collective bargaining agreement to establish means of addressing
 
contractual disputes: 
8
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
§89-10.8 Resolution of disputes; grievances.  (a) A
public employer shall enter into written agreement with the
exclusive representative setting forth a grievance procedure
culminating in a final and binding decision, to be invoked
in the event of any dispute concerning the interpretation or
application of a written agreement. The grievance procedure
shall be valid and enforceable[.]
 
HRS § 89-10.8(a) (Supp. 2009). We note that these grievance
 
procedures address disputes "concerning the interpretation or
 
application of a written agreement." Id. 
Uesato's decision to dismiss the School from
 
arbitration arose from such a dispute. The School questioned
 
whether there was any basis that compelled arbitration between
 
UPW and the School. In dismissing the School as a party to the
 
arbitration, Uesato addressed that preliminary issue, concluding
 
that there was "no basis for the Arbitrator to exercise
 
jurisdiction over [the School]" and noting that "[t]he ground for
 
[the School's] dismissal was the absence of an arbitration
 
agreement between [the School] and the UPW."
 
Consequently, when UPW moved to reopen the HLRB
 
proceedings on March 8, 2006, it was clear from Uesato's decision
 
to dismiss the School from the arbitration that Uesato would not
 
reach the statutory issues, i.e., the School's alleged violations
 
of HRS § 89-13. In light of Uesato's decision to dismiss the
 
School, those issues should have been resolved by the HLRB, which
 
has exclusive original jurisdiction over prohibited practice
 
claims under HRS § 89-14.
 
We accordingly hold that the circuit court erred in 
affirming the HLRB's orders denying UPW's motions to reopen 
proceedings as to the School. HLRB Order No. 2424 in Case No. 
CE-01-558 and Order No. 2425 in Case No. CE-01-594 prejudiced 
UPW's substantial rights and violated HRS § 89-14. Citizens 
Against Reckless Dev., 114 Hawai 'i at 193, 159 P.3d at 152. 
Our decision that the circuit court erred in affirming 
HLRB Orders Nos. 2424 and 2425 is based on the circumstances
 presented to the HLRB at the time the HLRB entered these orders. 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
We note that since that time, the circuit court vacated Uesato's
 
dismissal of the School from the arbitration proceedings and
 
remanded the case to Uesato for further arbitration proceedings
 
with respect to the School. We are not apprised of the present
 
state of the remanded arbitration proceedings regarding the
 
School, and we do not address whether the HLRB should reopen the
 
proceedings under the current circumstances. We merely address
 
the narrow legal issue of whether the circuit court erred in
 
affirming HLRB Orders Nos. 2424 and 2425.
 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
We vacate the First Amended Final Judgment filed in
 
Civil Nos. 07-1-0456 and 07-1-0457 on October 6, 2008 in the
 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit and remand for proceedings
 
consistent with this opinion.
