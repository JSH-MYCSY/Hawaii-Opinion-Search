Marn raises two points of error on appeal, contending
 
that the Circuit Court abused its discretion by: (1) awarding
 
attorneys' fees and costs to Plaintiff/Defendant/Appellee James
 
K.M. Dunn, Successor Trustee of the Annabelle Y. Dunn Trust dated
 
June 18, 1991 (AYD Trust), in the amount of $5,109.60 as a

sanction for filing a document entitled Submission of Reformatted
 
Version of Supplement to Motion for Reconsideration and/or New
 
Trial (Reformatted Supplement); and (2) striking the Reformatted
 
Supplement from the record.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Marn's points of error as follows:
 
(1) The Circuit Court based its sanctions on the
 
inherit power of the court set forth in Hawaii Revised Statutes
 
2
(HRS) ยง 603-21.9(6) (1993),  as discussed in Enos v. Pacific
Transfer & Warehouse, Inc.
, 79 Hawai' i 452, 903 P.2d 1273 (1995). 
Hawai'i courts "have the inherent power and authority 
to control the litigation process before them and to curb abuses and promote fair process including, for example, the power to 
impose sanctions for abusive litigation practices." Kaina v. 
Gellman, 119 Hawai' i 324, 330, 197 P.3d 776, 782 (App. 2008) 
(quoting Bank of Hawaii v. Kunimoto, 91 Hawai' i 372, 387, 984 
P.2d 1198, 1213 (1999)). The trial court's inherent power to sanction can be invoked "even if procedural rules exist which 
sanction the same conduct." Enos, 79 Hawai' i at 458, 903 P.2d at 
1279 (citation omitted). It is within a trial court's inherent power to award attorney's fees and costs as a sanction for 
abusive litigation practices. See Lester v. Rapp, 85 Hawai' i 
2
 HRS ยง 603-21.9(6) provides:
 
ยง 603-21.9. Powers.  The several circuit courts shall
 
have power:
 
. . . .
 
(6)
 To make and award such judgments, decrees, orders, and
mandates, issue such executions and other processes, and do
such other acts and take such other steps as may be
necessary to carry into full effect the powers which are or
shall be given to them by law or for the promotion of
justice in matters pending before them.

238, 241, 942 P.2d 502, 505 (1997) (citation omitted); Kukui Nuts
 
of Hawaii Inc. v. R. Baird & Co., Inc., 7 Haw. App. 598, 624, 789
 
P.2d 501, 517 (1990) (citation omitted).
 
A court may not invoke its inherent powers to sanction a 
represented party without a specific finding of "bad faith," and 
must also "inform the party of the authority pursuant to which he 
or she is to be sanctioned." Kaina, 119 Hawai' i at 331, 197 P.3d 
at 783 (citation omitted). Hawai' i appellate courts have defined 
"bad faith" as "actual or constructive fraud or a neglect or 
refusal to fulfill some duty . . . not prompted by an honest 
mistake as to one's rights or duties, but by some interested or 
sinister motive." Bank of Hawaii, 91 Hawai' i at 390, 984 P.2d at 
1216 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). However, the words "bad faith" need not be explicitly stated in the 
sanctioning order. Id. In Bank of Hawaii, the supreme court 
opined: 
Although the words 'bad faith' are not recited in the order,
the order makes clear that the trial judge considered Messrs.
Cappello and Hudgens to have acted in bad faith. The circuit
 court expressly found: (1) that appellants knew or should
have known that the CPB stock was in issue; (2) that
appellants' conduct in receiving the stock constituted a fraud
upon the court; and (3) that appellants' conduct was, at best,
reckless and, at worst, knowing and intentional. These
 findings are tantamount to a specific finding of bad faith.
In other words, these findings are sufficient to enable this
court to infer a specific finding of bad faith by the circuit
court.
 
Id. at 390, 984 P.2d at 1216 (citation, internal quotation marks,
 
and brackets omitted).
 
In this case, even without considering any broader 
context of these proceedings, the Circuit Court found in a July 
22, 2008 order (Order Granting Relief), that: (1) on May 12, 
2008, Marn filed a 60-page motion for reconsideration and/or new 
trial, without prior approval, without a table of contents, and 
without a table of authorities, in violation of Hawai' i Rules of 
Circuit Court (HRCC) 7.1; (2) on or about May 16, 2008, Marn 
submitted an ex parte motion requesting nunc pro tunc approval for 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
4having exceeded the 20-page limit set forth in HRCC 7.1, and
requesting leave to file an additional 20-page pleading in support
of the motion for reconsideration; (3) prior to the Circuit
Court's ruling on the ex parte  motion, on May 20, 2008, Marn filed
a 20-page document entitled "Supplement to Memorandum in Support
of Motion for Reconsideration and/or New Trial" ( Original
Supplement ); (4) on May 21, 2008, the Circuit Court granted the ex
parte motion, but limited any supplemental pleading to 10 pages;
(5) on May 27, 2008, the Circuit Court granted an ex parte motion
to strike the Original Supplement; (6) on May 28, 2008, Marn filed
the Reformatted Supplement, which included "Exhibit A," a 10-page
pleading that was substantially the same as the Original
Supplement, but using a different type set (and eliminating the
caption, title, date, and signature block, and reducing the left
margin to less than 1 inch); and (7) on June 13, 2008, AYD Trust
filed an amended motion, modifying the relief requested in a May
22, 2008 motion (and requesting, inter alia, that the court strike
the Reformatted Supplement and award its attorneys' fees and costs
as a sanction).  The Circuit Court found and concluded, inter
alia, that:
The [Reformatted Supplement] was a blatant attempt to
circumvent the 10 page limit set forth in this Court['s] order
filed on May 21, 2008 in addition to being filed untimely.
We conclude that the Circuit Court's findings and
conclusions (set forth in the Order Granting Relief) that Marn's
filing of the Reformatted Supplement was a blatant attempt to
circumvent the court's order were tantamount to a specific finding
of bad faith and are sufficient for this court to infer a specific
finding of bad faith by the Circuit Court.  See Bank of Hawaii, 91
Hawai#i at 390, 984 P.2d at 1216.  We reject Marn's argument that
the record does not support this finding.
We conclude, however, that the Circuit Court abused its
discretion by imposing monetary sanctions in connection with the
filing of the Original Supplement.  The Circuit Court made noNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
finding of bad faith, or finding tantamount to a finding of bad
 
faith, in connection with the filing of the Original Supplement. 
Therefore, we vacate the imposition of sanctions to the extent
 
that they stem from the filing of the Original Supplement.
 
(2) As the Circuit Court's findings and the record in
 
this case demonstrate, the Reformatted Supplement violated both
 
the Circuit Court Rules and the Circuit Court's May 21, 2008
 
order. Therefore, we conclude that Marn's contention that the
 
Circuit Court erred in striking the Reformatted Supplement is
 
without merit.
 
Accordingly, the Circuit Court's September 22, 2008
 
Order Awarding Sanctions is affirmed in part, vacated in part, and
 
remanded for a determination of the sanctions attributable only to
 
the filing of the Reformatted Supplement.
