(Circuit Court)  in favor of Defendants-Appellees HSC, Inc.
(HSC), Richard Henderson, Sr. (Richard), and Eleanor R.J.
 
Henderson (Eleanor) (Richard and Eleanor are referred to as the
 Hendersons) (collectively, HSC, Richard, and Eleanor are referred
 to as Appellees) and against the Schmidts. The Schmidts argue on
 appeal that the Circuit Court erred when it dismissed their
 
fraudulent transfers claims against Appellees. Appellees argue
 on cross-appeal that the Circuit Court erred when it concluded
 that the Schmidts' claims were not time-barred and when it failed
 to timely award Appellees their attorneys' fees and costs.
 I. BACKGROUND
 A. The Foreclosure Action
 This case stems from a foreclosure action called Realty 
Finance, Inc. v. Schmidt, which is chronicled in a Hawai
'i 
Supreme Court Memorandum Opinion (No. 23441) dated March 18, 2004. Realty Finance, Inc. v. Schmidt (Realty II), No. 23441, 
2004 WL 541878 (Haw. Mar. 18, 2004) (mem.). Relevant highlights are as follows.
2 
In 1991 and 1995, the Schmidts executed and delivered
 
various promissory notes and mortgages that were later assigned
 
3
to Realty Finance, Inc. (Realty Finance).  The Schmidts
 
subsequently defaulted on the notes and mortgages and Realty

 The Honorable Greg K. Nakamura presided.

preceding ICA Memorandum Opinion, which was reversed by the supreme court's
Memorandum Opinion, which rejected the ICA's legal analysis and conclusion,
but not its statement of the facts. The ICA's Memorandum Opinion, dated June
27, 2002, is accessible at http://www.state.hi.us/jud/ica23441mop2.htm#N_16_.

 Realty Finance is not a party to this present action.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Finance filed a foreclosure action against the Schmidts. On
 
February 24, 1998, a motion for an interlocutory decree of
 foreclosure was granted, the amount of the Schmidts' debt to
 Realty Finance was determined, and a judgment was entered. 
Thereafter, Realty Finance sold the Schmidts' notes and mortgages
 to another entity, Waikiki Investments 418, Inc. (Waikiki
 
Investments), pursuant to various agreements that, inter alia,
 allowed Waikiki Investments to collect the sums due on the notes
 
and mortgages.
 
In June of 1999, Waikiki Investments collected a total
 
4
of $309,000 from Amerasian Land Co. (Amerasian)  and $225,000
from Lulani Properties, LLC (
Lulani), which were intended to 
secure a release of the mortgages encumbering the mortgaged properties. Waikiki Investments then defaulted on its agreement with Realty Finance. In July of 1999, Realty Finance filed a notice stating that it was again the real-party-in-interest and it "revived" the foreclosure proceedings. After various further proceedings in the Circuit Court and the ICA, which were unfavorable to the Schmidts, on March 18, 2004, the Hawai
'i 
Supreme Court held: (1) that the Schmidts' notes and mortgages merged into the February 24, 1998 judgment; (2) thus, Realty Finance in effect assigned the right to proceeds under the judgment to Waikiki Investments; (3) when Amerasian and Lulani paid Waikiki Investments, they paid the debts identified in the February 24, 1998 judgment and, accordingly, paid down the 
4
 Thomas Schmidt is identified as the vice-president of Amerasian.
 
3
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
judgment; and (4) therefore, the mortgage debts owed by the
 
Schmidts were reduced by the payments made by Amerasian and
 Lulani to Waikiki Investments. See Realty II, mem. op. at 19-20. 
In essence, the supreme court agreed with Amerasian and the
 Schmidts' argument that it was wrong to require them to pay over
 $1,000,000 for a $564,000 judgment and to entitle Realty Finance
 and its assignees to collect over $1,000,000 on a $564,000
 judgment. The case was remanded, inter alia, for an appropriate
 accounting and further proceedings consistent with the supreme
 court's decision. The result was a December 21, 2004 final
 judgment, in the total sum of $537,258.66, entered in favor of
 the Schmidts and against Realty Finance.
 
B. The Realty Finance Transfers
 In the meantime, prior to the supreme court's ruling,
 
and after Realty Finance reasserted its interest in the
 foreclosure proceedings, Realty Finance sought and was granted
 approval of a private sale of the mortgaged properties. Pursuant
 to an order entered in the foreclosure proceedings on January 31,
 2000, the foreclosure commissioner distributed the sales proceeds
 to Realty Finance over the Schmidts' objections. Prior to a
 series of judgments "finalizing" the orders confirming the
 private sales, approving the distribution of the sales proceeds,
 and entering a deficiency judgment against the Schmidts, dated
 April 11, 2000, May 10, 2000, and June 9, 2000, respectively,
 Realty Finance used the sales proceeds for the benefit of its
 
4
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
parent corporation, HSC.5 More specifically, Realty Finance
 
directed payment to four of HSC's "creditors" as follows: (1) a
 
February 11, 2000 check payable to Richard in the amount of
 $54,339.55; (2) a February 11, 2000 check payable to Eleanor in
 the sum of $78,000.00; (3) a February 15, 2000 check payable to
 Goodsill, Anderson, Quinn and Stifel (Goodsill) in the amount of
 
$119,393.42; and (4) a March 1, 2000 check payable to Kamehameha
 
Schools-Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estate (Kamehameha Schools) in the
 
amount of $165,058.42.
 
C. The Schmidts' Discovery of the Transfers
 
The Schmidts became aware of the above-referenced
 
transfers on March 18, 2005, at the latest. On April 12, 2005,
 the Schmidts' attorney wrote to Appellees' attorney:
 
On March 18, 2005 we met with you at your offices, wherein,
in response to our document request, you produced documents
on behalf of Realty Finance. One of the documents that you
produced[] was the Realty Finance monthly bank statement for
February, 2000 at American Savings Bank. Said monthly
statement shows a deposit of $487,036.74 to Realty's
account, which we surmise to be the payment from the
foreclosure commissioner (Mr. Lau) of the proceeds due
Realty from the sale of the Schmidt property. Thereafter,
there are 4 checks: 1. #19264 for $54,339.55 on 2-14-00; 2.
#19263 for $78,000.00 on 2-14-00; 3. #20203 for $119,393.42
on 2-18-00; and, 4. #21769 for $165,058.42 on 3-1-00,
written on said account.
 
The Schmidts claim, however, that they did not discover
 
the fraudulent nature of the transfers until July 26, 2005, when
 
Realty Finance's former treasurer, Michael Chagami, was deposed. 
5
 In the ICA's decision in the foreclosure action, which was
reversed on other grounds, this court noted that Hawai' i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) Rule 54(b) did not authorize finalization of the April 11,
2000 or May 10, 2000 judgments.

D. The Proceedings Below
 
On April 7, 2006, the Schmidts filed a complaint 
against Appellees, alleging that the transfers were made in an effort to defraud them of the moneys owed to them, as finally determined in the Hawai
'i Supreme Court's March 18, 2004 
decision, the subsequent accounting, and the December 21, 2004 final judgment. In their complaint, the Schmidts alleged two causes of action, one for the fraudulent transfer of funds under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 651C-4(a)(1) (1993), Hawai
'i's 
Uniform Fraudulent Transfers Act (UFTA), and another for unfair 
or deceptive acts or practices pursuant to HRS § 480-2 (2008). 
Appellees moved for judgment on the pleadings on January 7, 2007. The Circuit Court granted Appellees' motion with respect to the HRS § 480-2 claims, but denied it as to the fraudulent transfers claims. Appellees filed a motion for summary judgment on October 1, 2007, after discovery was taken, arguing that the fraudulent transfers claims were without merit, and in any event, were time-barred. This motion was denied on the grounds that there were genuine issues of material fact relating to both arguments. 
A two-day bench trial was held on July 1 and 2, 2008. 
Appellees again moved for a judgment on partial findings based on
 the argument that the Schmidts' claims were time-barred. No
 order was entered on this motion. The Circuit Court issued
 Findings of Fact (FOFs) and Conclusions of Law (COLs) on October
 
7, 2008, and entered Final Judgment in favor of Appellees that
 
same day, holding that the Schmidts failed to prove an actual
 intent to hinder, delay, or defraud Realty Finance's creditors,
 
6
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
pursuant to HRS § 651C-4(a)(1). The Circuit Court's FOFs and
 
COLs; and Order of Dismissal state, in relevant part, the
 following: 
Findings of Fact
. . . . 
5. This action relates to four allegedly fraudulent
transfers by [Realty Finance]: (a) a check payable to
[Eleanor], dated February 11, 2000, in the amount of
$78,000; (b) a check payable to [Goodsill], dated February
15, 2000, in the amount of $119,393.42; (c) a check payable
to [Richard], dated February 11, 2000, in the amount of
$54,399.55; and (d) a check payable to [Kamehameha Schools]
in the amount of $165,058.42 from February 2000 (these four
checks are collectively referred to as "the Transfers").
 
6. The Transfers were made from the proceeds of a
mortgage foreclosure sale, which involved a transaction in
which [the Schmidts] were the mortgagors and [Realty
Finance], a subsidiary of HSC, was the mortgagee.
 
7. The foreclosure sale proceeds received by
[Realty Finance] were used for the Transfers. The Transfers
were payments to creditors of HSC.
 
8. There were some suspicious circumstances
regarding the Transfers:
a.	 HSC was the parent company of [Realty Finance].
The Transfers were made to creditors of HSC in
 order to pay [Realty Finance's] obligations to
HSC;
b.	 they were made through a separate account
apparently created to effectuate them;
c.	 they were made immediately after receipt of the
proceeds from the foreclosure sale; and
d.	 [The Schmidts] appealed the trial court's
judgment so, at the time of the Transfers, it
was questionable whether [Realty Finance] would
prevail on appeal. In order for [Realty Finance]
to prevail on appeal, the appellate court would
have to determine that it was appropriate to
require [the Schmidts] to, in effect, pay twice
in order to obtain a release from the judgment
received by [Realty Finance] in the foreclosure
action: once to the assignee of the judgment and
once to [Realty Finance] itself.
 
9. These circumstances did not constitute clear and
 
convincing evidence of any actual intent on the part of
[Appellees] to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditors of
[Realty Finance]:
a. When the Transfers were made, there was no
actual debt owed to [the Schmidts] by [Realty Finance].
b. There was no expert testimony demonstrating that
the Transfers were in violation of generally accepted
accounting practices.
c. At the time of the Transfers, there was no
business need to retain cash for the benefit of [the
Schmidts] should [the Schmidts] prevail on appeal. The onus
 was on [the Schmidts] to obtain a stay in order to maintain
the status quo pending the appeal. This would have enabled
 
7
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
them to have a fund available to recover from if they
prevailed on appeal. [The Schmidts] did not seek or obtain
such a stay.
d. At the time of the Transfers, [Realty Finance]
had bona fide obligations owed to HSC and there was a
legitimate business purpose in transferring RFI's assets to
reduce those obligations.
e. [Realty Finance] did not have possession or
control over the funds after the Transfers were made.
 
f. [Realty Finance] did not conceal the Transfers
by, for example, not recording the Transfers in its
accounting records or by entering into agreements with the
transferees not to disclose the existence of the Transfers.
 
g. The Transfers did not render [Realty Finance]
insolvent at the time they were made.
h. [Realty Finance] did not terminate its existence
after the Transfers.
 
Conclusions of Law 
. . . . 
5. Despite the facts reflected in [FOFs] 8(a)-(d),
[the Schmidts] did not prove by clear and convincing
evidence that [Realty Finance] actually intended to hinder,
delay, or defraud any creditors of [Realty Finance], as
required by HRS § 651C–4(a)(1).
 
Order
 
Based upon the foregoing [FOFs and COLs], this action
is to be dismissed and judgment is to be entered in favor of
[Appellees] and against [the Schmidts].
 
Three days later, on October 10, 2008, Appellees moved
 
for attorneys' fees and costs. On November 5, 2008, the Schmidts
 
filed a timely notice of appeal from the October 7, 2008
 judgment. The Circuit Court did not enter an order responding to
 Appellees' fees and costs motion until January 9, 2009, which was
 more than ninety days after Appellees filed the motion. 
Therefore, pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
6
(HRAP) Rule 4(a)(3),  Appellees' motion was deemed to be
6
 HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) provides:
 
TIME TO APPEAL AFFECTED BY POST-JUDGMENT MOTIONS. If any
party files a timely motion for . . . attorney's fees or
costs, the time for filing the notice of appeal is extended
until 30 days after entry of an order disposing of the
motion; provided, that the failure to dispose of any motion
by order entered upon the record within 90 days after the
date the motion was filed shall constitute a denial of the
 motion.
 
8
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
automatically denied. Appellees filed a cross-appeal on January
 
9, 2009. 
E. The ICA Memorandum Opinion
 On August 30, 2013, this court issued a Memorandum
 
Opinion concluding that the Schmidts' HRS § 651C-4(a)(1)
 fraudulent transfers claims were extinguished no later than one
 year after their discovery of the transfers on March 18, 2005 and
 that their April 7, 2006 complaint was untimely. See Schmidt v.
 
HSC, Inc., No. 29454 and 29589, 2013 WL 4711524 (Haw. App. Aug.
 30, 2013) (mem.) (Schmidt I). Accordingly, we did not reach the
 
merits of the Schmidts' points of error contending that the
 
Circuit Court erred in otherwise rejecting their fraudulent
 transfers claims. In addition, we ordered that the case be
 remanded to the Circuit Court for the limited purpose of allowing
 the Circuit Court to enter a ruling on the merits of Appellees'
 request for attorneys' fees and costs. 
F. Certiorari Review
 The Schmidts filed a petition for writ of certiorari
 
seeking review of the ICA's August 30, 2013 decision. On January
 15, 2014, the supreme court issued an Opinion holding, inter
 alia: 
[T]he one year statute of limitations period begins on the
date the fraudulent nature of the transfer "was or could
 reasonably have been discovered by the claimant." HRS
 § 651C-9(1). The ICA incorrectly held that the statute of
limitations runs from the date of [the discovery of] the
transfer, rather than the date that Petitioners discovered
the fraudulent nature of the transfer.
 
Schmidt v. HSC, Inc., 131 Hawai 'i 497, 510, 319 P.3d 416, 429 
(2014) (Schmidt II). The supreme court therefore vacated this 
9
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
court's ruling on the statute of limitations and "remanded the
 
issue to the ICA." Id. at 512, 319 P.3d at 431.
 
As the supreme court observed, however:
 
[T]he [circuit] court did not discuss the statute of
limitations in its findings and conclusions and therefore
did not issue any findings or conclusions regarding when
Petitioners discovered the "fraudulent nature" of the
 transfers.
 
Id. at 506, 319 P.3d at 425.
 
Nevertheless, the supreme court ordered:
 
[W]e remand the case to the ICA for a ruling on the merits
of the case, as raised in Petitioners’ appeal herein from
the October 7, 2008 judgment, irrespective of its decision
on the statute of limitations issue on remand.
 
Id. at 512, 319 P.3d at 431.
 
Accordingly, this court will address the merits of the
 
Schmidts' challenge to Circuit Court's rejection of their
 
fraudulent transfers claims, irrespective of whether their claims
 are or may be barred by the statute of limitations.
 II. POINTS OF ERROR
 
The Schmidts raise sixteen points of error on appeal,
 
challenging as clearly erroneous FOFs 5, 7, 8.a. (in two ways),
 9, 9.a., 9.b., 9.c., 9.d., 9.f., 9.g., as well as the Circuit
 Court's failure to make additional FOFs, contending that the
 Circuit Court's COL 5 was wrong, and asserting that the Circuit
 Court reversibly erred when it dismissed the Schmidts' action,
 entered judgment against them, and failed to award them damages,
 attorneys' fees, and costs.
 
On the cross-appeal, Appellees raise two points of
 
error, contending that the Circuit Circuit erred when it failed
 to conclude that the Schmidts' claims were time-barred and when
 
10
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
it failed to timely award Appellees their attorneys' fees and
 
costs.
 III. APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
Findings of fact are reviewed under the clearly 
erroneous standard. Bremer v. Weeks, 104 Hawai
'i 43, 51, 85 P.3d 
150, 158 (2004). Conclusions of law are reviewed de novo. Id. 
Fraudulent transfers must be proven by clear and 
convincing evidence. Kekona v. Abastillas, 113 Hawai 'i 174, 181, 
150 P.3d 823, 830 (2006). IV.	 DISCUSSION
 A. The Schmidts' Challenge to the Circuit Court's Ruling
 The gravamen of the Schmidts' appeal is that the
 
Circuit Court erred when it rejected their fraudulent transfers
 claims against Appellees. The Schmidts' claims were brought
 
7
pursuant to HRS § 651C-4(a)(1),  which provides:
§ 651C-4 Transfers fraudulent as to present and future
creditors. (a) A transfer made or obligation incurred by a
debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor, whether the
creditor's claim arose before or after the transfer was made
 or the obligation was incurred, if the debtor made the
transfer or incurred the obligation:
 
(1)	 With actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud
any creditor of the debtor[.]
 
The purpose of the UFTA is to stop a debtor from
 
deliberately cheating a creditor by placing property beyond his
 
or her reach. See
, e.g., Gilchinsky v. Nat'l Westminster Bank
 
N.J., 732 A.2d 482, 488 (N.J. 1999). As direct evidence of
 "actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud" is rare,
 particularly when the intent to be proven is that of a corporate
 
7
 UFTA provides alternative methods to establish that a transfer is
fraudulent, but these "constructive fraud" alternatives were not alleged by
the Schmidts. See HRS §§ 651C-4(a)(2) (1993) and 651C-5(a & b) (1993).
 
11
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
transferor, UFTA includes a non-exclusive list of factors,
 
sometimes referred to as badges of fraud, to aid the fact-finder. 
See, e.g., In re Roco Corp.,
 701 F.2d 978, 984 (1st Cir. 1983);
 
In re Strehlow, 84 B.R. 241, 245 (Bankr. S.D. Fla. 1988). 
Thus,
 
HRS § 651C-4(b) provides:
 
(b) In determining actual intent under subsection
(a)(1), consideration may be given, among other factors, to
whether:
 
(1) 	The transfer or obligation was to an insider;
(2) 	The debtor had retained possession or control of
the property transferred after the transfer;
(3) 	The transfer or obligation was disclosed or
concealed;
(4) 	Before the transfer was made or obligation was
incurred, the debtor was sued or threatened with
suit;
(5) 	The transfer was of substantially all the
debtor's assets;
(6)	 The debtor had absconded;
(7)	 The debtor had removed or concealed assets;
(8)	 The value of the consideration received by the
debtor was reasonably equivalent to the value of
the asset transferred or the amount of the
 obligation incurred;
(9) 	The debtor was insolvent or became insolvent
 shortly after the transfer was made or the
obligation was incurred;
(10)	 The transfer had occurred shortly before or
shortly after a substantial debt was incurred;
and
 
(11)	 The debtor had transferred the essential assets
 of the business to a lienor who had transferred
 the assets to an insider of the debtor. 
Without reference to HRS § 651C-4(b), in FOF 8, the
 
Circuit Court described a handful of "suspicious circumstances"
 
surrounding the transfers, and in FOF 9, the Circuit Court found
 that these circumstances did not constitute clear and convincing
 evidence of any actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud, in
 light of other factors considered by the court, which were
 enumerated in FOF 9. The Schmidts argue that the Circuit Court's
 incomplete and erroneous findings led it to wrongly conclude that
 the Schmidts did not prove, by clear and convincing evidence,
 
12
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that Realty Finance intended to hinder, delay, or defraud any
 
creditors, most particularly the Schmidts.
 
1. The transfers (FOF 5)
 
We begin with an examination of the transfers from
 
Realty Finance that are at issue in this case. In FOF 5, the
 Circuit Court identified the four February 2000 checks from
 Realty Finance to Eleanor in the amount of $78,000, to HSC's law
 firm in the amount of $119,393.42, to Richard in the amount of
 $54,399.55, and to another of HSC's creditors, Kamehameha
 Schools, in the amount of $165,058.48, for a total of
 $416,851.45. The Circuit Court's focus on these transfers is
 well-grounded, as these transfers were specifically identified by
 the Schmidts in their Amended Complaint as fraudulent transfers
 and, as the Circuit Court found in FOF 8.c., these transfers were
 "made immediately after [Realty Finance's] receipt of the
 proceeds of the foreclosure sale." 
However, based on the evidence presented at trial, the
 
Schmidts argued below and contend on appeal that Realty Finance
 made additional transfers for the benefit of HSC in 2000, for a
 total amount of $986,655, not just the $416,851.45 of transfers
 identified by the Circuit Court in FOF 5. In his trial
 testimony, Richard confirmed that there was a total "intercompany
 transfer" from Realty Finance to HSC (or HSC's creditors) in this
 amount in 2000, which amount also was supported by the Schmidts'
 trial exhibits, including HSC's consolidated balance sheet for
 the period ending December 31, 2000. Richard further testified
 that the transfers of funds from Realty Finance to or for the
 
13
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
benefit of HSC were not pursuant to any loan agreement; rather,
 
it was the return of HSC's capital investment in Realty Finance.
 
Appellees do not deny that Realty Finance's transfers
 
to or for the benefit of HSC in 2000 totaled $986,655, but
 instead argue that FOF 5 is an accurate statement of the
 transfers alleged in the Complaint and, therefore, the Schmidts'
 alleged error is irrelevant to the Schmidts' fraudulent transfers
 allegations. We disagree with the latter contention. The fact
 that Realty Finance "upstreamed" this money to HSC, as Richard
 and Chagami both described it in their trial testimony, as well
 as $86,527.24 in 2001 and $188,808.93 in 2002, which Richard and
 Chagami also confirmed at trial, left Realty Finance with
 $8,689.02 in its checking account at the end of 2002 (along with
 other minimal assets). It is undisputed that, by the time the
 foreclosure litigation was completed and judgment was entered in
 favor of the Schmidts, Realty Finance was unable to pay the
 judgment. The evidence of the additional transfers from Realty
 Finance to HSC is relevant to the critical issue of Realty
 Finance's motive, plan, modus operandi or intent, and,
 ultimately, whether Realty Finance acted with actual intent to
 hinder, delay, or defraud its creditors through the 2000
 transfers, within the context of UFTA. 
See, e.g., Wieboldt
 
Stores, Inc. v. Schottenstein, 94 B.R. 488, 504 (N.D. Ill. 1988)
 ("A general scheme or plan to strip the debtor of its assets
 without regard to the needs of its creditors can support a
 finding of actual intent.") (citing In re F & C Services, Inc.,
 44 B.R. 863, 872 (Bankr. S.D. Fla. 1984)). Although the
 
14
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
particular findings stated in FOF 5 are not clearly erroneous,
 
the lack of further findings regarding the evidence of Realty
 Finance's other transfers to HSC leaves us unable to determine
 whether the court considered this undisputed evidence in the
 context of its ultimate determination that the Schmidts failed to
 establish, by clear and convincing evidence, Realty Finance's
 actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud its creditors.
 
2. Realty Finance's creditors (FOF 7)
 
In FOF 7, the Circuit Court found that the foreclosure
 
sales proceeds received by Realty Finance were used for payments
 to creditors of HSC. The Schmidts contend that, although FOF 7
 is accurate, the Circuit Court clearly erred in making this
 finding because it failed to find that HSC itself was not a
 creditor of Realty Finance. As a preliminary matter, the fact
 that HSC was not a creditor of Realty Finance is undisputed. 
Henderson and Chagami both testified that Realty Finance was not
 indebted to HSC; rather, HSC invested capital into Realty
 Finance. As noted above, no one contests the Circuit Court's
 finding that the four February 2000 checks were payments to
 creditors of HSC. It is undisputed that the recipients were not
 creditors of Realty Finance. 
Although not the subject of any findings by the Circuit
 
Court, it also appears undisputed that (other) Realty Finance
 funds were used a few weeks earlier in 2000 to pay off the
 principal and interest due on a $250,000 loan First Hawaiian Bank
 made to HSC, as well as pay down $150,000 on another loan First
 Hawaiian Bank made to HSC. The evidence presented at trial
 
15
    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
suggests that HSC may have borrowed at least $350,000 from First
 
Hawaiian Bank for the purpose of infusing capital into Realty
 Finance pursuant to a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
 (FDIC) Cease and Desist Order directed at Realty Finance;
 
however, it is clear from the face of the FDIC's order that an
 
increase in Realty Finance's Tier 1 capital, not an increase in
 its debt, was required by the FDIC. Thus, although Realty
 
8
Finance had discontinued operations as a Thrift  by the time of
2000 transfers, and was no longer required to maintain compliance
 with the FDIC mandate, the indebtedness to First Hawaiian Bank
 was clearly HSC's debt, not Realty Finance's debt.
 
Appellees' response to the Schmidts' contention of
 
error is that it is irrelevant that HSC was an investor of
 capital in Realty Finance, as opposed to a creditor of Realty
 Finance.
9 Instead, Appellees argue, what is relevant is their
 
state of mind and their good faith belief that Realty Finance was
 expected to "repay" HSC for the funds that HSC invested in Realty
 Finance. Citing Mayors v. Comm'r of Internal Revenue, 785 F.2d

 The FDIC defines a Thrift as follows:
 
Thrift – A financial institution that ordinarily possesses
the same depository, credit, financial intermediary, and
account transactional functions as a bank, but which is
chiefly organized and primarily operated to promote savings
and home mortgage lending rather than commercial lending. A
 thrift can also be known as a savings bank, a savings
association, a savings and loan association, or an S&L.

 It appears that the Circuit Court was persuaded by this argument
because the court did not recognize the distinction between indebtedness
versus a capital contribution and, instead, found in FOF 9.d. that: "At the
 
time of the Transfers, [Realty Finance] had bona fide obligations owed to HSC
and there was a legitimate business purpose in transferring [Realty Finance's]
assets to reduce those obligations."
 
16
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
757, 761 (9th Cir. 1986), Appellees submit: "Where a defendant
 
has a good faith belief that an obligation must be paid – as
 opposed to the actual legal enforceability of the obligation
 being paid – the former is determinative." This supposition is
 flawed on a number of levels.
 
First, while a transferee's "good faith" may, when
 
combined with "reasonably equivalent value," provide a defense
 and protection of the transferee from the voiding of a transfer
 otherwise proven to be fraudulent pursuant to HRS § 651C­
10
4(a)(1),  the relevant inquiry, in the first instance, is
whether the alleged fraudulent 
transferor made the transfer with
 
the actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any of its
 creditors. See HRS § 651C-4(a)(1); see also, e.g., S.E.C. v.
 
Res. Dev. Int'l, LLC, 487 F.3d 295, 301 (5th Cir. 2007) ("'the
 transferees' knowing participation is irrelevant under the
 statute' for purposes of establishing the premise of (as opposed
 to liability for) a fraudulent transfer") (citation omitted);

 v. Schlussel, No. 315484, 2014 WL 5361675 (Mich. App. Oct. 21,

§ 651C-8 Defenses, liability, and protection of

under section 651C-4(a)(1) against a person who took in good
faith and for a reasonably equivalent value or against any
subsequent transferee or obligee.
 
17
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
transfers claim under Michigan's UFTA statute, that "the
 
determination that the transfer is fraudulent is conceptually
 distinct from the avoidance of the transfer") (format altered). 
In other words, first, the fact-finder must determine whether
 there is clear and convincing evidence of the transferor's
 fraudulent intent. Then, the fact-finder may examine whether the
 transferee took in good faith and for reasonably equivalent
 value.
 
Second, the Mayors case relied on by Appellees is
 
inapposite. Susan Mayors (Mayors) was the secretary and
 
receptionist of Dr. Joseph Averna (Averna) when they became
 involved, moved in together, and had a child, but did not marry. 
Mayors, 785 F.2d at 758. During their cohabitation, Mayors
 worked for Averna as a secretary, bookkeeper, and x-ray
 technician, and kept house for Averna. Id. She was paid below-
market wages for her office work and nothing for her housework,
 but was given funds for basic living expenses and occasional
 special needs. Id. at 758-59. When they separated years later,
 
through Mayors's counsel, they reached an oral agreement whereby
 Averna would, inter alia, transfer to Mayors the house that she
 and their child were living in. Id. at 759. At the time of the
 
transfer, Averna was insolvent and owed taxes to the Internal
 Revenue Service (IRS). Id. Pursuant to a federal statute, 26
 
U.S.C. § 6901(a), the IRS sought to hold Mayors liable as a
 transferee for the payment of Averna's unpaid taxes. Id. at 759­
60.
 
18
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (Ninth Circuit)
 
ruled in favor of Mayors, and against the IRS, based on its

 
interpretation and application of a California fraudulent
 
conveyance statute. Id. at 759-62. The applicable statute
 
worked as follows: 
once a prima facie case was established that
 
Averna was insolvent, Mayors had to prove that the transfer was
 for fair consideration. Id. at 760.
11 Mayors argued that "the
 
transfer of the house was in settlement of [Averna's] preexisting
 debt [to Mayors], and so constitute[d] fair consideration." Id.
 
(emphasis added). The lower court found, however, that Mayors
 had failed to prove the value of her services (i.e., the dollar
 amount that she was owed) and thus rejected her argument that she
 had an enforceable right to be compensated for them. Id. at 760­
61. The Ninth Circuit overruled the trial court and held (in a
 passage cited by Appellees):
 
Whether however, Mayors actually had an enforceable right
against Averna, is irrelevant to the fairness of the
consideration if Mayors and Averna believed in good faith
 
that she had such a right and the transfer was made to
satisfy it or in exchange for her forbearance from enforcing
it. It is well established in contract law that forbearance
 to exercise a legal right is sufficient consideration, as is
compromise of a claim, even if doubtful or disputed.
 
Id. at 761 (citations omitted).
 
Appellees seize upon this language to argue that HSC's
 
and the Hendersons' good faith belief that they always expected
 
repayment of HSC's investment in Realty Finance is determinative
 and, therefore, the fact that it was invested capital and not
 debt is irrelevant. We reject this argument. First, in Mayors,
 
11
 The California statute, Cal. Civ. Code Ann. § 3439.04 (West 1970),
is similar, but not identical, to HRS § 651C-5(a), which was not relied upon
by the Schmidts in pleading their fraudulent transfers claims.
 
19
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
there was no issue of debt versus a capital investment. Mayors
 
believed that Averna owed her money for her services. In
 addition, the "fair consideration" in 
Mayors was Mayors's
 
forbearance, i.e., the settlement of her claim against Averna for
 the payment of debt. Appellees are not arguing here that Realty
 Finance owed HSC a debt (as opposed to a return of its capital
 investment) and that the transfers were made for HSC's
 forbearance from filing suit on such indebtedness. In sum, the
 Mayors case simply does not support Appellees' assertion that the
 distinction between debt and invested capital is irrelevant.
 
Third, the return of a capital contribution to or for
 
the benefit of an investor is 
not the same as the repayment of
 
indebtedness to a creditor. As a Pennsylvania federal court
 aptly explained, applying Pennsylvania's UFTA:
 
PUFTA states that value is given where "property is
transferred or an antecedent debt is secured or satisfied." 
12 PA. CONS.STAT. § 5103(a). Defendant does not claim that
 property has been transferred, but does contend that its $57
million capital contribution to the Fund created a debt that
the Fund was contractually obligated to satisfy pursuant to
the distribution provisions of the Limited Partnership
Agreement ("LPA").
 
PUFTA defines "debt" as "liability on a claim." 12
 
PA. CONS.STAT. § 5101(b). In turn, "claim" is defined as "a
right to payment, whether or not the right is reduced to
judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent,
matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal equitable,
secured or unsecured." 
Id. It is well-established that a
 
limited partnership interest constitutes an equity security.
Buncher Co. v. Official Comm. of Unsecured Creditors of
 GenFarm Ltd. P'ship IV, 229 F.3d 245, 252 (3d Cir. 2000).
In turn, courts within the Third Circuit have consistently
held that equity interests are not "debt" within the meaning
of PUFTA or the Bankruptcy Code's analogous fraudulent
transfer provision. In re Joshua Slocum, Ltd., 103 B.R.
610, 623 (Bankr. E.D. Pa.1989) (stating that stockholders'
right to dividends is dependent on financial solvency of
corporation, and is therefore not fixed liability or debt);
In re Fidelity Bond and Mortg. Co., 340 B.R. 266, 286–87
(Bankr. E.D. Pa. 2006) (finding that issuance of dividends
returned no value to debtor); In re Color Tile, Inc., No.
CIV.A.98–358, 2000 WL 152129, at *5 (D. Del. Feb. 9, 2000)
(finding that the purchase of preferred shares and resulting
dividends were an equity interest, and thus that the
 
20

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
dividend payments could not constitute satisfaction of an
antecedent debt).
 
It follows, then, that limited partnership
distributions do not qualify as "antecedent debt"
constituting an exchange "for value" for the purposes of
PUFTA. It is widely held that true creditors "hold claims
regardless of the performance of the partnership business,"
whereas payment of partnership distributions are "subject to
[ ] profits or losses." 
In re Riverside–Linden Inv. Co.,
925 F.2d 320, 323 (9th Cir. 1991). To hold that a limited
 partner interest constitutes a debt of the partnership would
allow limited partners to receive distributions ahead of
even secured creditors. Such a holding would be
inconsistent with both the purpose of PUFTA (to protect
creditors) and the meaning of "distributable funds" within
the LPA at issue here (those funds not subject to
"indebtedness or liabilities"). Consistent with this logic,
several courts have held that distributions made on account
 of partnership interests do not give rise to a "right to
payment" and are thus not "for value." See, e.g., In re
Agric. Research & Tech. Grp., Inc., 916 F.2d 528 (9th Cir.
1990) (distributions to a limited partner "were not for
value because [the partnership] made the distributions on
account of the partnership interests and not on account of
debt or property transferred to the partnership in exchange
for the distribution"); In re Thunderdome Houston Ltd.
P'ship, No. CIV.A.98–4615, 2000 WL 889846 (Bankr. N.D. Ill.
June 23, 2000).
 
Defendant attempts to undercut the aforementioned
cases by arguing that, even if its investment in the
partnership did not create debt, its contribution conferred
"value" on the partnership via the risk it undertook by
investing with the hope of a future economic benefit. The
 cases Defendant offers in support of this proposition, while
numerous, fail to persuade the Court that equity investments
confer value on a transferor. . . . 
Based on careful examination of current UFTA
 
jurisprudence and the policies underlying the statute, the
Court finds that Defendant's capital contributions to the
Fund, a limited partnership in which Defendant had an
ownership interest, did not constitute an exchange of value
sufficient to create an antecedent debt. It follows that
 Defendant cannot, as a matter of law, assert a defense to
judgment under 5108(b)(2).
 
United States v. Rocky Mountain Holdings, Inc. , 782 F. Supp. 2d
 
106, 122-24 (E.D. Pa. 2011) (footnotes omitted).
 
Sitting en banc, the Arizona Supreme Court agreed with
 
this fundamental distinction between debt and equity, in the
 
context of an UFTA constructive fraud analysis:
 
The court of appeals concluded that Suncrest's distribution
to the limited partners was not a "transfer for value" under
A.R.S. section 44-1003(A). Hullett [v. Cousin], 201 Ariz.
 
at 123, ¶ 14, 32 P.3d at 48. As pointed out by the court of
 
21
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
appeals, distribution of a limited partner's capital
contribution is the return of an asset, not satisfaction of
an antecedent debt. Id. at 123, ¶ 15, 32 P.3d at 48; see
also In re Riverside-Linden Investment Co., 
 925 F.2d 320,
323 & n. 1 (9th Cir. 1991) (finding interest in a
partnership is not a debt of the partnership). We agree
with this reasoning. Under A.R.S. section 44-1003(A), a
 distribution of assets previously advanced by the limited
partners, for example capital contributions, may be a return
of value previously advanced to the partnership, but it is

not a transfer for value.[12]
Hullett v. Cousin, 63 P.3d 1029, 1035-36 (Ariz. 2003) (en banc)
 
(footnote omitted; emphasis added).
 
Numerous other courts, in various contexts, have
 
recognized the important distinction between the repayment of
 indebtedness and the return of invested capital. See, e.g.,
 
Yankee Microwave, Inc. v. Petricca Commc'ns Sys., Inc., 760
 N.E.2d 739, 760 (Mass. App. Ct. 2002) (where loans were a
 substitute for capital, and thus treated as capital
 contributions, repayment of such loans leaving insufficient
 capital as to those who are or would become creditors, was held
 to be a transfer without fair consideration in violation of
 Massachusetts's fraudulent conveyance act); Tanzi v. Fiberglass
 Swimming Pools, Inc., 414 A.2d 484, 489 (R.I. 1980) ("Clearly,
 persons making capital contributions are not corporate
 creditors."); In re Lexington Oil & Gas Ltd., Co., 423 B.R. 353
 (Bankr. E.D. Okla. 2010) (analyzing distinction between debt and
 equity in conjunction with UFTA analysis); Rapid Displays, Inc.
 v. Gorder, No. 02-252-JE, 2007 WL 1796002 (D. Or. June 20, 2007)
 (repayment of capital contribution, as opposed to loan, may be
 relevant to UFTA claim); In re Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP, 518 B.R. 766,
 
12
 A.R.S. section 44-1003(A) is (with the addition of a pair of
 
parenthetical commas) identical to HRS § 651C-3(a), which defines when "value"
is given for a transfer or obligation.
 
22
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
789-90 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2014) (holding that, to the extent the
 
challenged transfers were made as returns of former partners'
 capital contributions, the transfers were not made on account of
 antecedent debts and therefore could not be construed as
 "reasonably equivalent value" as a matter of law).
 
In sum, we conclude that, although FOF 7's finding that
 
the alleged fraudulent transfers were payments to the creditors
 of HSC is accurate, the Schmidts' contention that the Circuit
 Court erred in failing to find that HSC was not a creditor of
 Realty Finance has merit. 
3. Challenges to FOF 8.a.
 
The Schmidts challenge FOF 8.a. on grounds similar to
 
their challenge to FOF 7. In FOF 8.a., the Circuit Court found
 that the allegedly fraudulent transfers were made to HSC's
 creditors in order to "pay" Realty Finance's "obligations" to
 HSC. While not disputing that such payments were made, the
 Schmidts argue, in effect, that construing these transfers as
 payments for obligations blurs the distinction between the
 payment of Realty Finance's creditors and the return of invested
 capital to or for the benefit of insider investors. The Schmidts
 submit that when, instead of paying its debts, or retaining
 sufficient funds to pay its debts, Realty Finance transferred
 these funds to or for the benefit of its insider investors,
 Realty Finance's actions constituted strong evidence of actual
 intent to hinder, delay, or defraud its creditors. 
Again, Appellees argue that, because HSC had made
 
capital investments in Realty Finance in excess of $1,000,000,
 
23
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and expected "repayment," the Circuit Court's finding is
 
supported by the evidence and is not clearly erroneous. This
 argument ignores, however, the fundamental tenet, that a
 shareholder's "right" to receive return of invested capital
 and/or the profits of a corporation is subject to the rights of
 the corporation's creditors. See, e.g., Hamilton v. Conley, 827
 
N.E.2d 949, 958 (Ill. App. Ct. 2005) ("Shareholders of a
 corporation are entitled to receive the corporation's assets
 subject to the rights of the corporation's creditors.") (citation
 omitted; emphasis in original). We agree with the Schmidts that
 the Circuit Court's failure to recognize the important
 distinction between the payment of debt owed to a creditor and
 the return of invested capital to an investor, which is reflected
 in FOF 8.a., caused or contributed to an erroneous conclusion
 that the Schmidts failed to establish clear and convincing
 evidence of Realty Finance's actual intent to hinder, delay, or
 defraud any of its creditors. 
4. "Actual debt" owed to the Schmidts (FOF 9.a.)
 
In FOF 9, the Circuit Court identifies several
 
circumstances as support for its conclusion that the Schmidts
 failed to demonstrate "clear and convincing evidence of any
 actual intent on the part of any Defendant to hinder, delay, or
 defraud any creditors of [Realty Finance]." (Emphasis added.) 
First, as discussed above, the relevant intent in conjunction
 with an HRS § 651C-4(a)(1) claim is the intent of the transferor,
 Realty Finance. The transferees' fraudulent intent, lack
 thereof, or even good faith acceptance of the transferred asset,
 
24
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
is not at issue in the determination of the transferor's actual
 
intent to hinder, delay, or defraud as to present and future

 
creditors.13 The Circuit Court's reference in FOF 9 to "any
 
Defendant" appears to include HSC and the Hendersons, but not
 transferor Realty Finance, which erroneously frames the key
 issue, which is the actual intent of the transferor.
14
 
In FOF 9.a., the Circuit Court found that, when the
 
allegedly fraudulent transfers were made, "there was not actual
 debt owed to [the Schmidts] by [Realty Finance]." As the
 Schmidts argue, however, in a November 23, 2007 pre-trial order
 denying Appellees' motion for summary judgment (Pre-trial Order),
 
the Circuit Court correctly included, inter alia, the following
 
ruling:
 
Under HRS § 651C-1, a 'debtor' 'means a person against
whom a creditor has a claim.' A 'creditor' 'means a person
who had a claim against a debtor.' HRS § 651C-1. Finally,
a 'claim':
 
'means a right to payment, whether or not the right is
reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed,
contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed,
legal, equitable, secured, or unsecured.'
HRS § 651C-1.
Based on these definitions, at the time of the
transfers in this case, [the Schmidts] were still
'creditors' of Realty Finance even though Realty Finance had
so far prevailed in the foreclosure action. . . .
. . . .
 Realty Finance was subject to [the Schmidts'] claim
for recovery in the foreclosure action at the time the
transfers were made.
 
13
 As noted, however, HRS § 651C-8 provides a defense for a
transferee who took in good faith and for reasonably equivalent value.
 
14
 In response to the Schmidts' assertions of error in FOF 9
generally, and FOF 9.a. in particular, Appellees fail to acknowledge that the
"actual intent" at issue in this case is that of the transferor, Realty
Finance, and instead submit that the Circuit Court was not clearly wrong in
FOF 9 because FOF 9 indicates that it addresses their lack of actual intent to
 
hinder, delay, or defraud. This circular argument is unavailing. In order to
 properly adjudicate the Schmidts' HRS § 651C-4(a)(1) claims, the Circuit Court
needed to address whether clear and convincing evidence established Realty
 Finance's actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud its creditors. 
25
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Schmidts argue that the Circuit Court erred when it
 
apparently abandoned this analysis in FOF 9.a. by finding that
 
there was "no actual debt" owed to the Schmidts by Realty
 Finance.
 
In response, Appellees ignore the Schmidts' reference
 
to the Circuit Court's ruling in the Pre-trial Order and instead
 argue that the Schmidts "cannot demonstrate that FOF No. 9a was
 not supported by the evidence" because the "Schmidts' imaginative
 theory that their 2004 judgment can be retroactively considered a
 'claim' dating back to 2000 does not change that no 'actual' debt
 was owed to the Schmidts in 2000." As the Circuit Court
 recognized in the first instance (in the Pre-trial Order), HRS
 § 651C-4(a)(1) claims are not limited to fraudulent transfers
 made to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors who have claims that
 have been finally adjudicated. In fact, as noted by the Circuit
 Court in the Pre-trial Order, pursuant to HRS § 651C-1, a
 creditor is "a person who had a claim against a debtor" and a
 claim is "a right to payment, whether or not the right is reduced
 to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent,
 matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable,
 secured, or unsecured." (Emphasis added.)
 
Indeed, HRS § 651C-4 is entitled "Transfers fraudulent 
to present and future creditors." (Emphasis added.) As the United States District Court for the District of Hawai
'i has 
recognized, "Hawaii's Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, HRS Chapter 651C–4, has abrogated the common law distinction between pre-existing creditors and subsequent creditors." Sherry v. 
26
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Ross, 846 F. Supp. 1424, 1429 n.4 (D. Haw. 1994). Courts in
 
other UFTA jurisdictions have similarly addressed the fallacy of
 Appellees' argument, including as follows:
 
[A]ppellees argue that the transfer of the subject property
to the trust could not have been fraudulent because no
 litigation had commenced at the time of transfer, and Blood
had yet to become a judgment creditor. This argument is
also incorrect: R.C. 1336.04 refers to the attempt by the
debtor to avoid a "claim" or a potential claim, not the
execution of a judgment, . . . and a "claim" may arise
before litigation commences to enforce that claim. Thus, a
debtor may make a fraudulent transfer in anticipation of a
claim.
Blood v. Nofzinger,  834 N.E.2d 358, 364-65 (Ohio Ct. App. 2005),
citing Colonial Guild Ltd. v. Pruitt, No. 00CA007696, 2001 WL
 
324377 (Ohio Ct. App. Apr. 4, 2001) (also applying Ohio's UFTA
 statute); Kilker v. Stillman, No. G045813, 2012 WL 5902348 at *4­5 (Cal. Ct. App. Nov. 26, 2012) (discussing protection of future,
 as well as present, creditors under UFTA).
 
 

 
. . . The UFTA "broadly defines the word 'creditor' to
mean any person who has a claim." [ National Loan Investors, 
L.P. v. Givens, 952 P.2d 1067, 1069 (Utah 1998)] (citing
Utah Code Ann. § 25–6–2(4)). A "claim" is also broadly
defined under the UFTA as a "right to payment, whether or
not the right is reduced to judgment, liquidated,
unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured,
disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or
unsecured." Utah Code Ann. § 25–6–2(3).
 
Based on the broad definition of a claim under the
 
UFTA and the direction from our supreme court to construe
the statute liberally, we hold that Jeanne was "indeed, a
creditor of [Robert], given that [her] claim to the
[properties]—although not reduced to judgment [at the
time]—had arisen through recent threats [of civil action]."
Bradford , 1999 UT App 373 at ¶ 16, 993 P.2d 887. Jeanne's
 
numerous threats of suit and Robert's awareness of probable
legal action against him amount to a "claim" for purposes of
the UFTA. See United States v. Green, 201 F.3d 251, 257 (3d
Cir. 2000) (citing Baker v. Geist, 457 Pa. 73, 321 A.2d 634
(1974), for the holding that mere "awareness of a probable
legal action against a debtor amounts to a debt" for
purposes of the Pennsylvania Uniform Fraudulent Conveyances
Act); Bradford, 1999 UT App 373 at ¶ 16, 993 P.2d 887; 37
Am.Jur.2d Fraudulent Conveyances and Transfers § 3 (2001)
("The existence of a debt is a requirement for bringing a
fraudulent conveyance action and generally speaking, the
awareness of probable legal action against a debtor amounts
to a 'debt.'" (footnotes omitted)). The trial court found
 that "[w]hile the Plaintiff, Jeanne Tolle, did not file
civil suit until February, 2002 in Florida and procure a
 
27

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
judgment until September 24, 2004, the Plaintiff made her
intentions clear to Robert Tolle and the other defendants
 prior to any transfers." For purposes of the UFTA, Jeanne
is therefore a creditor whose claim arose before Robert
 transferred the properties.
 
Tolle v. Fenley, 132 P.3d 63, 66-67 (Utah App. 2006); see also
 
Morris v. Schnoor, Nos. 315006, 315007, 315702, 315742, 2014 WL
 2355705 at *51 (Mich. App. May 29, 2014) (applying Michigan's
 UFTA statute). 
This case is even clearer. The Schmidts and Realty
 
Finance were actively involved in pending litigation over the
 Schmidts' claim to the transferred funds when the allegedly
 fraudulent transfers were made. The concept of "actual debt," as
 stated in FOF 9.a., is a red herring. The Schmidts were UFTA
 creditors of Realty Finance at the time of the subject transfers. 
The Circuit Court clearly erred in relying on FOF 9.a. to support
 its conclusion that the Schmidts failed to prove their claims.
 
5. Expert testimony re GAAP practices (FOF 9.b.)
 
In FOF 9.b., the Circuit Court found that there was no
 
expert testimony that the allegedly fraudulent transfers were in
 violation of generally-accepted accounting practices (GAAP). As
 
Appellees argue, this appears to accurately reflect the record in
 
this case - there was no such testimony. The Schmidts' challenge
 to this finding, however, is a challenge to the Circuit Court's
 consideration of this fact as part of the short list of
 enumerated facts that led to the Circuit Court's conclusion that
 the evidence in the record was insufficient to meet the Schmidts'
 burden of proof in demonstrating fraudulent intent. As the
 Schmidts frame the issue, the "looting" of Realty Finance's
 
28
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
assets while the litigation over the proper disposition of the
 
foreclosure proceeds was still pending amounted to a preference
 of HSC's creditors over Realty Finance's creditors and no court
 would require expert opinions on whether such egregious conduct
 is permissible. Appellees counter that the absence of expert
 testimony demonstrating that the alleged fraudulent transfers
 violated GAAP is a failure of proof that there was any
 impropriety involved in the transfers. Appellees cite no
 authorities requiring proof of GAAP violations to evidence actual
 intent to hinder, delay, or defraud under UFTA.
 
We do not adopt the Schmidts' colorful terminology
 
(i.e., looting of corporate assets), but we recognize the basic
 tenet of corporate law that a corporation's creditors are
 entitled to be satisfied before the corporation's assets are
 distributed to and/or for the benefit of its shareholders. See,
 
e.g., HRS § 414-111 (2004) (permitting corporate distributions to
 shareholders unless, as a result, inter alia, "[t]he
 corporation's total assets would be less than the sum of its
 total liabilities plus (unless the articles of incorporation
 permit otherwise) the amount that would be needed, if the
 corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution,
 to satisfy [superior] preferential [shareholder] rights"). 
Although we cannot conclude that the fact stated in FOF 9.b. is
 clearly erroneous, it has no evidentiary value under the
 circumstances of this case.
15
 
15
 This is particularly true considering that, in FOF 9, the Circuit
Court was examining Appellees' intent, rather the Realty Finance's intent, to

6. No stay pending appeal (FOF 9.c.)
 
The Schmidts contend that the Circuit Court clearly
 
erred in FOF 9.c., wherein it found, inter alia, that "[t]he onus
 
was on [the Schmidts] to obtain a stay in order to maintain the
 status quo pending the appeal." We agree with the Schmidts. 
Although not dispositive of the issue, we note that the allegedly
 fraudulent transfers were completed prior to the entry of an
 appealable judgment on the January 31, 2000 order directing the
 foreclosure commissioner to distribute the sales proceeds to
 Realty Finance over the Schmidts' objections. Thus, there was no
 opportunity for the Schmidts to "maintain the status quo" by
 seeking a stay pending appeal; the money was gone before the
 order was even appealable. In fact, as the Circuit Court
 recognized in FOF 8.c., the timing of the transfers, immediately
 after Realty Finance's receipt of the proceeds of the foreclosure
 sales, was itself a suspicious circumstance; as discussed further
 below, the timing of the transfers constitutes evidence of Realty
 Finance's intent to hinder, delay, or defraud its creditors. As
 to the assertion of error in FOF 9.c., more importantly, the
 Schmidts' failure to swiftly act, in anticipation that Realty
 Finance might immediately transfer the funds out of reach of its
 creditors, is wholly irrelevant to the issue of whether Realty
 Finance did so with the actual intent to hinder, delay, or
 defraud any of its creditors.

determine whether the Schmidts had met their burden of proof on their HRS

§ 651C-4(a)(1) claims.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
7.	 Bona fide obligations/legitimate business purpose
(FOF 9.d.)
 
The Schmidts challenge FOF 9.d., wherein the Circuit
 
Court found that Realty Factors had "bona fide obligations owed
 
to HSC" and that there was a "legitimate business purpose" for
 the transfers. Appellees point to HSC's "advance" of moneys,
 i.e., its capital contributions to Realty Finance. In addition,
 Appellees point to the evidence that Realty Finance "had no real
 operations remaining in 2000 requiring funds, since the vast bulk
 of its business had been sold off under FDIC supervision." 
Chagami testified that a decision was made in 1999 to wind down
 Realty Finance, to exit the business; Richard described it as
 Realty Finance being liquidated. Appellees' argument, which was
 expressly adopted by the Circuit Court, is that the "legitimate
 business purpose" was the pay back of the moneys advanced by HSC
 and the "bona fide obligation" was the obligation to return
 invested capital to Realty Finance's investors as part of the
 wind up of its business. In isolation, these specific findings
 are not wholly inaccurate because the return of invested capital
 during a corporate liquidation is a legitimate business purpose,
 provided that the corporation's creditors are satisfied.
16 I n
 
the context of FOF 9, which sets forth the reasons that the
 Circuit Court articulated for ruling against the Schmidts, these
 findings ignore the fundamental difference between debt and
 
16
 Richard acknowledged this obligation at trial, in conjunction with
his testimony that Realty Finance was being liquidated in 2000 because it was
out of business. In response to the question of "what's involved in a
liquidation phase of a corporate business," Richard answered: "Collecting
[your] assets and paying off your liabilities and giving the money back to the
shareholder." 
31
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
equity, discussed above, and Realty Finance's duty in a wind up 
to satisfy its creditors before returning capital to its insider investors. See, e.g., HRS § 414-111 (Hawai
'i Business 
Corporation Act provision regarding distributions to shareholders); Tanzi, 414 A.2d at 489, 491 ("persons making capital contributions are not corporate creditors;" capital contributions are subordinated to the claims of the general creditors); Rocky Mountain Holdings, Inc., 782 F. Supp. 2d at 122 (equity interest is not a debt; return of a capital contribution is not satisfaction of an antecedent debt constituting an exchange for value under UFTA); TSA Int'l Ltd. v. Shimizu Corp., 92 Hawai
'i 243, 262-63, 990 P.2d 713, 732-33 (1999) (TSA was an 
investor, not a creditor of transferor, within the meaning of UFTA, and therefore not eligible to bring fraudulent transfers claim). Realty Finance's failure to satisfy its creditors or retain sufficient assets to do so, and to instead, in effect, return invested capital to its insider investor, is evidence of actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud its creditors. Thus, the Circuit Court clearly erred in construing the "bona fide obligations" and "legitimate business purpose" as circumstances that mitigated the indicia of Realty Finance's actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud in this case. 
8. Concealment (FOF 9.f.)
 
In FOF 9.f., the Circuit Court found that Realty
 
Finance did not conceal the allegedly fraudulent transfers,
 noting that it did not, for example, fail to record the transfers
 in its accounting records or require the recipients of the
 
32
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
tranfers to enter confidentiality agreements. We agree. We note
 
that Realty Finance's opening of a separate bank account, which
 neither Henderson or Chagami could explain at trial, apparently
 for the purpose of depositing and then distributing the
 foreclosure sales proceeds, by way of checks that were not
 imprinted with the account owner/drawer's name and address (i.e.,
 Realty Finance's), is at least unusual and appears to be
 suspicious. However, fraudulent concealment involves an
 affirmative act of active concealment, rather than a failure to
 proactively disclose. See, e.g., Schempp v. Lucre Mgmt. Grp.,
 
LLC, 75 P.3d 1157, 1162 (Colo. App. 2003) (transfer was not
 concealed generally and was recorded in books, therefore not
 concealed); Bostwick v. Thomas, No. 2008-0466, 9 Pa. D. & C. 5th
 353, 359, 2009 WL 5909302 (Pa. Com. Pl. Nov. 12, 2009) ("failure
 by defendant Thomas to inform plaintiff of the existence of the
 property does not amount to concealment"); Grimmett v. Brown, 75
 F.3d 506, 515 (9th Cir. 1996) (fraudulent concealment requires
 active concealment). Thus, we conclude that the Circuit Court
 properly found that concealment was not established.
 
9. Insolvency (FOF 9.g.)
 
In FOF 9.g., the Circuit Court found that the four
 
allegedly fraudulent transfers that took place immediately after
 Realty Finance received the sales proceeds from the foreclosure
 commissioner did not render Realty Finance insolvent at the time
 they were made. This finding pertains to HRS § 651C-4(b)(9),
 which states that, in determining actual intent under HRS § 651C­4(a)(1), the trier-of-fact may consider whether "[t]he debtor was
 
33
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
insolvent or became insolvent shortly after the transfer was
 
made[.]" HRS § 651C-2(a) provides that a "debtor is insolvent if
 the sum of the debtor's debts is greater than all of the debtor's
 assets, at a fair valuation." HRS § 651C-2(d) adds that
 "[a]ssets under this section do not include property that has
 been transferred, concealed, or removed with intent to hinder,
 delay, or defraud creditors[.]"
 
The Schmidts highlight the FDIC's actions against
 
Realty Finance, which necessitated capital infusions from HSC, as
 evidence that Realty Finance had been insolvent for three years
 before the allegedly fraudulent transfers. The Schmidts also
 direct this court to the undisputed evidence that Realty Finance
 transferred substantially all of its assets to and/or for the
 benefit of HSC by the end of 2002, before the 2004 completion of
 the litigation over who was entitled to the foreclosure proceeds. 
This evidence tends to show that the allegedly fraudulent
 transfers were part of an overall series of transactions intended
 to "upstream" nearly all of Realty Finance's assets to and/or for
 the benefit of its insider investors, to the detriment of its
 creditors, as that term is defined in HRS § 651C-1, most
 particularly the Schmidts, who were actively litigating their
 entitlement to the foreclosure proceeds. See, e.g., In re Mussa,
 
215 B.R. 158, 169 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 1997);
17 Falcon v. Thomas,
 
17
 In Mussa, 215 B.R. at 169, the court explained:
 
[T]he transfers consisted of substantially all of
Debtors' assets and left them insolvent. In this regard, it
must initially be pointed out that the series of transfers
by Debtors of their cash, property, and business to their
son may be considered together for purposes of UFTA.
(continued...)
 
34
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
629 N.E.2d 789, 796-97 (Ill. App. Ct. 1994) (in a constructive
 
fraud case, considering debtor's later transfers, which were not
 specifically challenged as fraudulent, as "part of the totality
 of the circumstances"). However, the evidence regarding the
 overall scheme to "upstream" Realty Finance's cash assets does
 not demonstrate that Realty Finance was insolvent or became
 insolvent shortly after the four specific transfers referenced in
 FOF 8.g. were made. On appeal, the Schmidts point to no specific
 evidence of insolvency at that particular time. Accordingly,
 although the February 2000 transfers were indisputably part of a
 larger series of transfers to HSC that rendered Realty Finance
 judgment proof, we reject the Schmidts' argument that the Circuit
 Court clearly erred in the narrow finding stated in FOF 9.g.
 
10. The Schmidts' remaining contentions of error
 
The Schmidts make several additional arguments, which
 
we will categorize as: (a) arguments that the Circuit Court
 
17(...continued)
Although the language of the UFTA speaks in terms of a

single transfer of property, a series of transfers may also
be found to be fraudulent. See Falcon v. Thomas, 258 Ill.
App. 3d 900, 196 Ill. Dec. 244, 629 N.E.2d 789 (1994);
Wieboldt Stores, Inc. v. Schottenstein, 94 B.R. 488, 504
(N.D. Ill. 1988) ("A general scheme or plan to strip the
debtor of its assets without regard to the needs of its
creditors can support a finding of actual intent.") (citing
In re F & C Services, Inc., 44 B.R. 863, 872 (Bankr. S.D.
Fla. 1984)). Where a debtor systematically reduces his
estate leaving virtually nothing for creditors, the
conveyances may be fraudulent. Dorocke v. Farrington, 43
Ill. App. 2d 394, 397, 193 N.E.2d 593, 594 (1963) (debtor
systematically transferred his assets over the course of
several years). Counsel for Defendants contended at trial
 that the transfers must be viewed as individual transfers,
and therefore none of them, viewed individually, stripped
Debtors of all their assets nor rendered them insolvent. 
However, the weight of authority does not support that view,
as the foregoing cited authorities made clear.
 
35
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
erred overall in its determination of the facts and its legal
 
conclusion, including that it failed to properly characterize the
 "suspicious circumstances" as evidence of actual intent, it
 failed to make additional findings that are important to the HRS
 § 651C-4 analysis of actual intent, and it erred in its
 conclusion that the Schmidts failed to demonstrate, by clear and
 convincing evidence, Realty Finance's actual intent to hinder,
 delay, or defraud any of its creditors; and (b) arguments that,
 based on the foregoing errors, including the previously-discussed
 errors in FOFs 5, 7, 8, and 9, the Circuit Court erred when it
 dismissed the Schmidts' fraudulent transfers claims, entered
 judgment against them, and failed to award them damages,
 interest, attorneys' fees, and costs. This section deals
 primarily with the first set of arguments, deferring the latter
 contentions of error to the following section and the conclusion
 of this Opinion.
 
As set forth above, HRS § 651C-4(b) provides a non­
exclusive list of factors that may either support, negate, or, in
 some instances, not have an effect on the determination of an
 UFTA debtor's actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud an UFTA
 creditor. We review each in turn, as well as unenumerated
 factors that appear in the record:
 
HRS § 651C-4(b)(1). The transfer or obligation was to
 
an insider. As re-affirmed in their Answering Brief, Appellees
 
have never disputed that the allegedly fraudulent transfers were
 made to or for the benefit of "insiders," as defined in HRS
 § 651C-1. Instead, Appellees argue that "this fact alone is not
 
36
   
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
helpful, much less determinative, in assessing [Appellees']
 
actual fraudulent intent, where the other factors indicated an
 absence of scienter."
18
 
While, alone, the undisputed fact that the allegedly
 
fraudulent transfers were made to or for the benefit of insiders
 is not determinative, it is significant. As stated in the
 official Comments to § 4 of the National Conference of
 Commissioners on Uniform State Law's Uniform Fraudulent Transfer
 Act, upon which HRS Chapter 651C was based: 
The fact that a transfer has been made to a relative or to
 
an affiliated corporation has not been regarded as a badge
of fraud sufficient to warrant avoidance when unaccompanied
by any other evidence of fraud. The courts have uniformly
recognized, however, that a transfer to a closely related
person warrants close scrutiny of the other circumstances,
including the nature and extent of the consideration
exchanged.
 
Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act 7A Part II (U.L.A.) § 4, cmt. 5,
p. 60 (2006) (citation omitted; emphasis added).
 
 
HRS § 651C-4(b)(2). 
The debtor had retained possession
 
or control of the property transferred after the transfer. 
Realty Finance did not retain possession or control of the
 transferred funds. 
HRS § 651C-4(b)(3). The transfer or obligation was
 
disclosed or concealed. Although the allegedly fraudulent
 
transfers by Realty Factors were not contemporaneously disclosed
 to the Schmidts (or, it appears, disclosed at any time prior to
 Chagami's deposition in July of 2005), as the Circuit Court
 found, concealment was not established.
 
18
 As discussed above, the actual intent at issue in HRS § 651C­
4(a)(1) is that of the transferor, Realty Finance.
 
37
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRS § 651C-4(b)(4). Before the transfer was made or
 
obligation was incurred, the debtor was sued or threatened with
 
suit. This factor is well-established and the circumstances here
 
provide strong evidence of Realty Finance's actual intent to
 hinder, delay, or defraud the Schmidts. As the Circuit Court
 discussed in FOF 8.d., Realty Finance was actively involved in
 litigation over the funds at issue when they were transferred to
 or for the benefit of Realty Finance insiders. See Achiles v.
 
Cajigal, 39 Haw. 493, 498 (1952) (a pre-UFTA case holding, inter
 alia, that "[p]roof of pending or anticipated litigation at the
 time of the transfer is one of the most commonly recognized
 indicia which would bear upon [the] issue of the debtor's intent
 to defeat the claim of creditors") (citation omitted); see also,
 e.g., Rich v. Rich, 405 S.E.2d 858, 864 (W.Va.1991) ("The timing
 of this transfer simply cannot be disregarded. The fact that it
 occurred two weeks after the first arrearage order was entered,
 while an appeal on a related matter was pending . . . cannot be
 overlooked. As [UFTA] makes clear, the proximity of a transfer
 to the incurrence of a substantial debt is a factor indicative of
 'actual intent.'"). Notwithstanding the testimony of Chagami,
 Richard, and Eleanor, who professed not to have (personally)
 known that the Schmidts were still litigating their entitlement
 to the funds,
19 Realty Finance had knowledge of the litigation.
 
19
 The Circuit Court made no record of its assessment of their
 
credibility in this regard. We note, however, that Richard and Chagami, who
testified that the two of them made the decision to disburse the funds, were
well enough informed about the status of the foreclosure action to make the
disbursements "immediately after receipt of the proceeds of the foreclosure
sale" as set forth in FOF 8.c.
 
38
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
It is undisputed that: (1) at all relevant times in 
the foreclosure proceedings, the Schmidts opposed, objected to, 
and sought relief from the order that distributed the proceeds of the sales of the mortgaged properties to Realty Finance; and (2) Realty Finance, which was prosecuting the "revived" foreclosure proceedings and actively arguing in favor of its claim to the sales proceeds (and against the Schmidts' claim), was represented by its attorneys, the Ashford & Wriston law firm, who were well aware of the Schmidts' claim, as evidenced by those proceedings. It is axiomatic that a corporation's attorneys act as the corporation's agents in litigation. See, e.g., Oahu Plumbing & 
Sheet Metal, Ltd. v. Kona Constr., Inc., 60 Haw. 372, 377-78, 590 P.2d 570, 574 (1979) (holding that non-attorney agents are not allowed to represent corporations in litigation). Thus, Realty Finance was (at a minimum) charged with the attorneys' knowledge of the Schmidts' active claims, notwithstanding Richard and Chagami's testimony that they decided to immediately disburse the funds, i.e., execute those four allegedly fraudulent transfers, without consulting their attorneys. See, e.g., Daiichi Hawaii 
Real Estate Corp. v. Lichter, 103 Hawai
'i 325, 347, 82 P.3d 411, 
433 (2003) ("a corporation, once charged with knowledge of a particular transaction or event, continues to be affected by such knowledge" notwithstanding any individual corporate personnel's lack of personal knowledge) (citation omitted); Imperial Fin. Corp. v. Finance Factors, Ltd., 53 Haw. 203, 205-06, 490 P.2d 662, 663-64 (1971) (knowledge of a corporation's agent is generally imputed to its principal). Indeed, it would be 
39
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
reasonable to infer that Harris Hirata, whom Richard described at
 
trial as the person who "ran Realty Finance," had direct
 knowledge of the ongoing nature of the Schmidts' claims because
 at Realty Finance's October 2000 Board Meeting, Mr. Hirata
 reported to the Board on the status of the foreclosure
 proceedings, including that the case was on appeal.
 
HRS § 651C-4(b)(5). The transfer was of substantially
 
all the debtor's assets. The Circuit Court made no post-trial
 
findings addressing this factor. The lack of findings on this
 point, coupled with the lack of findings concerning the evidence
 of Realty Finance's other transfers to HSC (noted in Section
 IV.A.1. above), makes it difficult to conclusively determine whether or not this factor was established. We note, however, that the Circuit Court found in the Pre-trial Order: "Although it may be true that Realty Finance retained enough cash to pay for its current operations, the transfers resulted in its inability to satisfy Plaintiffs' judgment against it." This finding was undisturbed by the Circuit Court's post-trial rulings, although the court was free to re-examine it, and it is unchallenged on appeal; therefore, this finding constitutes an operative fact in this case. See, e.g., Querubin v. Thronas, 107 
Hawai
'i 48, 60, 109 P.3d 689, 701 (2005) ("so long as a trial 
court retains jurisdiction, it always has the power to reexamine, modify, vacate, correct and reverse its prior rulings and orders") (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); Cun-
Lara v. State, 126 Hawai
'i 541, 544 n.5, 273 P.3d 1227, 1230 n.5 
(App. 2012) ("'Findings of fact that are unchallenged on appeal 
40
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
are the operative facts of a case.'") (quoting Robert's Haw. 
Sch. Bus, Inc. v. Laupahoehoe Transp. Co., 91 Hawai 'i 224, 239, 
982 P.2d 853, 868 (1999), superseded by statute on other grounds as recognized in Haw. Med. Ass'n v. Haw. Med. Serv. Ass'n, 113 Hawai
'i 77, 107, 148 P.3d 1179, 1209 (2006)). 
HRS § 651C-4(b)(6). The debtor had absconded. 
Realty
 
Finance did not secret itself, escape, or otherwise abscond to
 avoid detection.
 
HRS § 651C-4(b)(7). 
The debtor had removed or
 
concealed assets. Except for the funds that were "upstreamed" to
 
or for the benefit of HSC, there is no evidence that Realty
 Finance removed or concealed assets. 
HRS § 651C-4(b)(8). The value of the consideration
 
received by the debtor was reasonably equivalent to the value of
 the asset transferred or the amount of the obligation incurred. 
As discussed in Sections IV.A.2. and IV.A.7. above, the Circuit
 Court clearly misapprehended this factor and erred when, instead
 of finding no consideration of reasonably equivalent value, it
 referenced bona fide obligations and legitimate business
 purposes. To recap this prior discussion: (1) under the
 relevant UFTA provision (see HRS § 651C-3(a)), value is given for
 a transfer if, in exchange, an antecedent debt is satisfied; (2)
 the distribution or return of a capital contribution is not a
 transfer for value; (3) here, Realty Finance owed no debt to HSC
 or the transferees; and (4) therefore, Realty Finance's transfer
 of funds to or for the benefit of HSC to "repay" HSC's capital
 contributions was without fair consideration and was not a
 
41
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
transfer for reasonably equivalent value. See, e.g., Rocky
 
Mountain Holdings, Inc., 782 F. Supp. 2d at 122-23; Hullett, 63
 
P.3d at 1035-36; 
Yankee Microwave, Inc., 760 N.E.2d at 760;
 
Tanzi, 414 A.2d at 489; In re Lexington Oil & Gas Ltd., Co., 423
 B.R. 353; and In re Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP, 518 B.R. at 789-90 (as
 discussed in Section IV.A.2 above).
 
HRS § 651C-4(b)(9). The debtor was insolvent or became

 
insolvent shortly after the transfer was made or the obligation
 was incurred. As discussed in Section IV.A.9. above, on appeal,
 
the Schmidts failed to adequately support their argument that the
 Circuit Court clearly erred in finding that the four allegedly
 fraudulent transfers that took place immediately after Realty
 Finance received the foreclosure sales proceeds did not render
 Realty Finance insolvent "shortly after" those transfers
 occurred. Nor, based on the HRS § 651C-2 definition of
 insolvency, can we conclude that Realty Finance was insolvent at
 the time of those transfers. However, as further discussed
 above, the evidence presented by the Schmidts tends to show that
 the allegedly fraudulent transfers were part of an overall series
 of transactions intended to "upstream" nearly all of Realty
 Finance's assets to or for the benefit of its insider investors,
 to the detriment of the Schmidts, who were actively litigating
 their claims against Realty Finance.
 
HRS § 651C-4(b)(10). The transfer had occurred shortly
 
before or shortly after a substantial debt was incurred. Realty
 
Finance's debt to the Schmidts was incurred when it received the
 foreclosure sales proceeds that were due to the Schmidts. 
42
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Particularly in light of the undisputed fact that Realty Finance
 
was no longer operating as a Thrift and was in the process of
 winding down its business, this was clearly a substantial debt
 that was incurred shortly before the allegedly fraudulent
 transfers were executed.
 
HRS § 651C-4(b)(11). The debtor had transferred the
 
essential assets of the business to a lienor who had transferred
 the assets to an insider of the debtor. This factor is not
 
implicated in this case.
 
Other factors, not specifically enumerated in HRS
 
§ 651C-4(b). In addition to the specific HRS § 651C-4(b) factors
 discussed above, there are additional relevant facts evidenced in
 the record of this case. 
HRS § 651C-4(b)(10) addresses the timing of the
 
allegedly fraudulent transfers vis à vis the incurring of the
 debt to the Schmidts, but does not fully address another relevant
 timing consideration. The transfers were made, to the benefit of
 Realty Finance insiders, at the time that Realty Finance was in
 the process of winding down or going out of business. As Richard
 testified at trial, in the year 2000 alone, Realty Finance
 "upstreamed" or distributed $986,655 of cash to or for the
 benefit of HSC. Thus, with the systematic depletion of its
 remaining assets as they became liquid, Realty Finance eliminated
 all possible sources for the payment of the Schmidts, who were
 indisputably creditors, as defined in UFTA. Indeed, Richard, a
 certified public accountant, testified that he (along with
 Chagami) was the Realty Finance decision-maker who decided to
 
43
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
make the allegedly fraudulent transfers. We cannot ignore the
 
fact that, as one of the transferees, the President of and major
 investor in HSC, and the husband of Eleanor, Richard personally
 benefitted, directly or indirectly, from all of the transfers
 which, in fact, hindered and delayed the Schmidts' efforts to
 recover the foreclosure sales proceeds that were erroneously paid
 to Realty Finance.
 
Relatedly, notwithstanding that Realty Finance was
 
going out of business and had essentially no source of future
 income to pay its debts, none of the recipients of the allegedly
 fraudulent transfer were creditors of Realty Finance. Nor was
 HSC, the sole shareholder in Realty Finance, a creditor of Realty
 Finance.
 
Also, while perhaps less significant than Richard's
 
dual role as benefactor and beneficiary, as the Circuit Court
 found in FOF 8.b., the allegedly fraudulent transfers were made
 through a separate bank account that was apparently created to
 effectuate the transfers. There was no evidence of any business
 purpose in creating that separate account. Richard and Chagami
 testified that they did not recall why they opened the separate
 account. The account appears to have been employed with haste,
 as imprinted checks were not used. Although the actual reasons
 that this account was used is not clear, while Realty Finance was
 ending its business and winding up its affairs, it is indeed a
 suspicious circumstance.
 
Finally, while other aspects of the Schmidt litigation
 
were the subject of Realty Finance board meetings and decisions,

there was no board action taken and no consultation with counsel
 
was had before the transfer decision was made, notwithstanding
 the years of litigation that preceded Realty Finance's receipt of
 the foreclosure sales proceeds.
 
11.	 Clear and Convincing Evidence of Realty Finance's
Actual Intent to Hinder, Delay, or Defraud its
Creditors
 
The "suspicious circumstances" identified by the
 
Circuit Court in FOFs 8.a.-8.d. constitute badges of fraud or
 
indicia of Realty Finance's actual intent to hinder, delay, or
 defraud its creditors. In addition, the Circuit Court clearly
 erred in significant respects in its findings in FOFs 9.a., 9.c.,
 and 9.d., and wrongly viewed its findings in FOF 9.b. as
 negativing the badges of fraud. As recounted above, the Schmidts
 established many of the clearest, most compelling, and most
 widely recognized indicia of Realty Finance's actual intent to
 hinder, delay, or defraud creditors under UFTA, i.e., HRS § 651C­4(a)(1) and (b). Ample, clear, and convincing evidence of Realty
 Finance's actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors
 exists, including the following indicia of fraudulent intent: 
Realty Finance's transfers of funds were made to or for the
 benefit of insiders who were not creditors of Realty Finance; the
 transfers were made while litigation over the transferred funds
 was pending; prior to the litigation being completed, Realty
 Finance "upstreamed" nearly all of its assets to or for the
 benefit of its insider investor, leaving it unable to pay the
 Schmidts; Realty Finance received no consideration of reasonably
 equivalent value for the transfers; the transfers occurred
 
45
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
immediately after Realty Finance's substantial indebtedness to
 
the Schmidts was incurred; the transfers were made while Realty
 Finance was winding up its business, thus leaving no foreseeable
 source to pay its UFTA creditors, the Schmidts; and the other
 relevant facts discussed in Sections IV.A.1.-10. above. 
Accordingly, we conclude that the Circuit Court was wrong to
 conclude in COL 5 that the facts established by the record in
 this case "did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that
 [Realty Finance] actually intended to hinder, delay, or defraud
 any creditors of [Realty Finance], as required by HRS
 § 651C–4(a)(1)."
 
B.	 The Cross-Appeal
 1.	 Statute of limitations
 
Appellees maintain that the Schmidts' UFTA claims were
 
time-barred under HRS § 651C-9(1) (1993), which states the
 following: 
§ 651C-9 Extinguishment of cause of action. A cause
 
of action with respect to a fraudulent transfer or
obligation under this chapter is extinguished unless action
is brought:
 
(1)	 Under section 651C-4(a)(1), within four years
after the transfer was made or the obligation
was incurred or, if later, within one year after
the transfer or obligation was or could
reasonably have been discovered by the claimant;
. . . . 
(Emphasis added.)
 
The allegedly fraudulent transfers were made

 
(primarily) in February of 2000. The Schmidts filed the
 
Complaint herein on April 7, 2006. Thus, the Schmidts'
 fraudulent transfers claims would be untimely, pursuant to HRS
 § 651C-9(1), unless suit was filed "within one year after the
 
46
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
transfer or obligation was or could reasonably have been 
discovered" by the Schmidts. See also Schmidt II, 131 Hawai 'i at 
511-12, 319 P.3d at 430-31. In Schmidt II, the supreme court held that this one-year period begins "when a plaintiff discovers the fraudulent nature of a potential transfer," rather than simply the transfer itself. Id. at 507, 510, 319 P.3d at 426, 
429. 
Here, the Schmidts contend that they did not discover
 
the fraudulent nature of the transfers until July 26, 2005, or,
 at the earliest, April 20, 2005. July 26, 2005 was the date when
 the Schmidts' counsel deposed Chagami, who testified that Realty
 Finance transferred the foreclosure sale proceeds to HSC for the
 purposes of satisfying several of HSC's obligations and that
 Realty Finance was insolvent as of December 2004. April 20, 2005
 was the date when the Schmidts' counsel received copies of the
 four checks and discovered to whom the funds were transferred. 
Appellees argue that, notwithstanding the purported
 
"actual" date of the Schmidts' discovery, with any level of
 diligence, the Schmidts would have discovered the purportedly
 fraudulent transfers, including that the transfers were made to 
and/or for the benefit of insiders, long before April 20, 2005. 
Appellees note various "tools" that the Schmidts could and should
 have used to discover the transfer earlier. For example,
 Appellees point to an August 2004 discovery request by the
 Schmidts that was purportedly "abandoned by the Schmidts and
 never pursued." Appellees contend, inter alia, that the Schmidts
 could and should have commenced discovery of their UFTA claims
 
47
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
forthwith upon the supreme court's March 18, 2004 decision in
 
their favor. The Schmidts, on the other hand, argue that they
 were unable to obtain a final judgment, on remand, until December
 21, 2004, and they proceeded diligently thereafter. Appellees
 invite this court to determine, as a matter of law, that the
 alleged fraudulent transfers "could reasonably have been
 discovered" more than one year prior to the filing of this suit. 
We decline to do so.
 
The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has held that 
"[r]easonableness can only constitute a question of law . . . when the facts are undisputed and not fairly susceptible of divergent inferences, because, where, upon all the evidence, but one inference may reasonably be drawn, there is no issue for the jury." Courbat v. Dahana Ranch, Inc., 111 Hawai
'i 254, 263, 141 
P.3d 427, 436 (2006) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); see also, e.g., Willis v. Swain, 129 Hawai
'i 478, 496, 
304 P.3d 619, 637 (2013), Amfac, Inc. v. Waikiki Beachcomber 
Inv. Co., 74 Haw. 85, 87, 839 P.2d 10, 15 (1992). In this case, we cannot say that reasonable minds could only draw one inference from the purportedly undisputed facts concerning when the Schmidts could reasonably have discovered both the insider transfers and their allegedly fraudulent nature. Indeed, as observed by the supreme court in Schmidt II, the Circuit Court did not issue any findings or legal conclusions regarding when 
48
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the Schmidts discovered, or reasonably could have discovered, the
 
"fraudulent nature" of the transfers. Thus, this court
 necessarily remands this issue for a decision, in the first
 instance, by the Circuit Court.
 
2. Attorneys' Fees
 
In light of our disposition on the merits of the 
parties' appeals, a final determination of whether Appellees are entitled to attorneys' fees cannot be made, as the prevailing party must be determined on remand. See Schmidt II, 131 Hawai
'i 
at 512, 319 P.3d at 431. However, as asserted by Appellees, the Circuit Court erred in failing to timely decide their motion for fees and costs, resulting in the motion being deemed denied pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). V. CONCLUSION
 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's October 7, 2008
 
Final Judgment is vacated and this case is remanded for further
 proceedings consistent with this Opinion. Specifically, the
 Circuit Court must determine whether the Schmidts' fraudulent
 transfers are time-barred and, if they are not, the Circuit Court
 shall enter judgment in favor of the Schmidts in amounts to be
 determined by the Circuit Court, including determination of the
 Schmidts' claims for pre-judgment interest, post-judgment
 interest, attorneys' fees and taxable costs. If the Schmidts'
 fraudulent transfers claims are determined to be time-barred, the 
49
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Circuit Court shall enter judgment in favor of Appellees, and a
 
renewed request by Appellees for attorneys' fees and costs shall
 be timely considered.
