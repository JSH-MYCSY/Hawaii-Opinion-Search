I. BACKGROUND
 
A. The Foreclosure Action
 
The definitive and detailed saga of Realty Finance, 
Inc. v. Schmidt, is chronicled in the Hawai' i Supreme Court's 
Memorandum Opinion (No. 23441) dated March 18, 2004. The 
relevant highlights are as follows.2 
In 1991 and 1995, the Schmidts executed and delivered
 
various promissory notes and mortgages that were later assigned
 
3
to Realty Finance, Inc. (Realty Finance).  The Schmidts
 
subsequently defaulted on the notes and mortgages and Realty
 
Finance filed a foreclosure action against the Schmidts. 
On
 
February 24, 1998, a motion for an interlocutory decree of
 foreclosure was granted, the amount of the Schmidts' debt to
 
Realty Finance was determined, and a judgment was entered. 
Thereafter, Realty Finance sold the Schmidts' notes and mortgages
 
to another entity, Waikiki Investments 418, Inc. (Waikiki
 
Investments), pursuant to various agreements that, inter alia,
 
allowed Waikiki Investments to collect the sums due on the notes
 
and mortgages.
 
In June of 1999, Waikiki Investments collected a total
 
4
 and $225,000
 of $309,000 from Amerasian Land Co. (Amerasian)
from Lulani Properties, LLC (Lulani), which were intended to
 
secure a release of the mortgages encumbering the mortgaged

 The supreme court's Memorandum Opinion is accessible at
http://www.state.hi.us/jud/23441mop.htm. Additional facts are set forth in
 
the preceding Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) Memorandum Opinion, which
was reversed by the supreme court's Memorandum Opinion, which rejected the
ICA's legal analysis and conclusion, but not its statement of the facts. The
 ICA's Memorandum Opinion, dated June 27, 2002, is accessible at
http://www.state.hi.us/jud/ica23441mop2.htm#N_16_.

properties. Waikiki Investments then defaulted on its agreement 
with Realty Finance. In July of 1999, Realty Finance filed a 
notice stating that it was again the real-party-in-interest and 
"revived" the foreclosure proceedings. After various further 
proceedings in the Circuit Court and the ICA, which were 
unfavorable to the Schmidts, on March 18, 2004, the Hawai' i 
Supreme Court held: (1) that the Schmidts' notes and mortgages merged into the February 24, 1998 judgment; (2) thus, Realty 
Finance in effect assigned the right to proceeds under the 
judgment to Waikiki Investments; (3) when Amerasian and Lulani 
paid Waikiki Investments, they paid the debts identified in the 
February 24, 1998 judgment and, accordingly, paid down the 
judgment; and (4) therefore, the mortgage debts owed by the 
Schmidts were reduced by the payments made by Amerasian and 
Lulani to Waikiki Investments. In essence, the supreme court 
agreed with Amerasian and the Schmidts' argument that it was 
wrong to require them to pay over $1,000,000 for a $564,000 
judgment and to entitle Realty Finance and its assignees to 
collect over $1,000,000 on a $564,000 judgment. The case was 
remanded, inter alia, for an appropriate accounting and further 
proceedings consistent with the supreme court's decision. The 
result was a judgment debt in favor of the Schmidts. 
B. The Realty Finance Transfers
 In the meantime, prior to the supreme court's ruling,
 
and after Realty Finance reasserted its interest in the
 foreclosure proceedings, Realty Finance sought and was granted
 
approval of a private sale of the mortgaged properties. Pursuant
 
to an order entered in the foreclosure proceedings on January 31,
 
2000, the foreclosure commissioner distributed the sales proceeds
 
to Realty Finance over the Schmidts' objections. Prior to a
 
series of judgments "finalizing" the orders confirming the
 
private sale, approving the distribution of the sale proceeds,
 
and entering a deficiency judgment against the Schmidts, dated
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
April 11, 2000, May 10, 2000, and June 9, 2000, respectively,
 
Realty Finance used the sale proceeds to the benefit of its
 
parent corporation, HSC.5 More specifically, Realty Finance
 
directed payment to four of HSC's "creditors" as follows: (1) a
 February 11, 2000 check payable to Richard in the amount of
 
$54,339.55; (2) a February 11, 2000 check payable to Eleanor in
 
the sum of $78,000.00; (3) a February 15, 2000 check payable to
 
Goodsill, Anderson, Quinn and Stifel in the amount of
 
$119,393.42; and (4) a March 1, 2000 check payable to Kamehameha
 
Schools-Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estate.
 
C. The Schmidts' Discovery of the Transfers
 The Schmidts became aware of the above-referenced
 
transfers on March 18, 2005, at the latest. On April 12, 2005,
 the Schmidts' attorney wrote to the Appellees' attorney:
 
On March 18, 2005 we met with you at your offices, wherein,
in response to our document request, you produced documents
on behalf of Realty Finance. One of the documents that you
produced was the Realty Finance monthly bank statement for
February, 2000 at American Savings Bank. Said monthly
statement shows a deposit of $487,036.74 to Realty's
account, which we surmise to be the payment from the
foreclosure commissioner (Mr. Lau) of the proceeds due
Realty from the sale of the Schmidt property. Thereafter,
there are 4 checks: 1. #19264 for $54,339.55 on 2-14-00; 2.
#19263 for $78,000.00 on 2-14-00; 3. #20203 for $119,393.42
on 2-18-00; and, 4. #21769 for $165,058.42 on 3-1-00,
written on said account.
 
The Schmidts claim, however, that they did not discover
 
the fraudulent nature of the transfers until July 26, 2005, when
 
Realty Finance's former treasurer, Michael Chagami, was deposed. 
D. The Proceedings Below
 On April 7, 2006, the Schmidts filed a complaint 
against the Appellees, alleging that the transfers were made in an effort to defraud them of the moneys owed to them after the 
Hawai'i Supreme Court's decision and the subsequent accounting. 
5
 In the ICA's decision in the foreclosure action, which was
reversed on other grounds, this court noted that Hawai' i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) Rule 54(b) did not authorize finalization of the April 11,
2000 or May 10, 2000 judgments. 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In their complaint, the Schmidts alleged two causes of action,
 
one for the fraudulent transfer of funds under Hawaii Revised
 
Statutes (HRS) § 651C-4(a)(1) (1993) and another for unfair or
 
deceptive acts or practices pursuant to HRS § 480-2 (2008). The
 
Appellees moved for judgment on the pleadings on January 7, 2007. 
The Circuit Court granted the Appellees' motion with respect to
 
the HRS § 480-2 claim, but denied it as to the fraudulent
 
transfers claim. The Appellees filed a motion for summary
 
judgment on October 1, 2007, after discovery was taken, arguing
 
that the fraudulent transfers claim was without merit, and in any
 
event, was time-barred. This motion was denied on the grounds
 
that there were genuine issues of material fact relating to both
 
arguments.
 
A two-day bench trial was held on July 1 and 2, 2008. 
Appellees again moved for a judgment on partial findings based on 
the argument that the Schmidts' claim was time-barred. No order 
was entered on this motion. The Circuit Court issued its 
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on October 7, 2008, and 
entered Final Judgment in favor of the Appellees that same day, 
holding that the Appellants failed to prove an actual intent to 
hinder, delay, or defraud Realty Finance's creditors, pursuant to 
HRS § 651C-4(a)(1). Three days later, the Appellees moved for 
attorneys' fees and costs. On November 5, 2008, the Appellants 
filed a timely notice of appeal from the October 7, 2008 
judgment. The Circuit Court did not enter an order responding to 
the Appellees' fees and costs motion until January 9, 2009, which 
was more than ninety days after the Appellees filed the motion. 
Therefore, pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
6
(HRAP) Rule 4(a)(3),  the Appellees' motion was deemed to be
automatically denied. The Appellees filed a cross-appeal on
 
January 9, 2009.
 
II. POINTS OF ERROR
 
The Schmidts raise sixteen points of error on appeal,
 
challenging as clearly erroneous Findings of Fact (FOFs) 5, 7,
 
8.a. (in two ways), 9, 9.a., 9.b., 9.c., 9.d., 9.f., 9.g., as
 
well as the Circuit Court's failure to make additional FOFs,
 
contending that the Circuit Court's Conclusion of Law 5 was
 
wrong, and asserting that the Circuit Court reversibly erred when
 
it dismissed the Schmidt's action, entered judgment against them,
 
and failed to award them damages, attorneys' fees, and costs.
 
On the cross-appeal, Appellees raise two points of
 
error, contending that the Circuit Circuit erred when it failed
 
to conclude that the Schmidts' claim was time-barred and when it
 
failed to timely award Appellees' their attorneys' fees and
 
costs.
 
III. APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
Findings of fact are reviewed under the clearly 
erroneous standard. Bremer v. Weeks, 104 Hawai' i 43, 51, 85 P.3d 
150, 158 (2004). 
6
 HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) provides:
 
TIME TO APPEAL AFFECTED BY POST-JUDGMENT MOTIONS. If any
party files a timely motion for . . . attorney's fees or
costs, the time for filing the notice of appeal is extended
until 30 days after entry of an order disposing of the
motion; provided, that the failure to dispose of any motion
by order entered upon the record within 90 days after the
date the motion was filed shall constitute a denial of the
 motion.

Conclusions of law are reviewed de novo. Id. 
Statutory interpretation is also reviewed de novo. Bhakta v. 
Cnty. of Maui, 109 Hawai' i 198, 208, 124 P.3d 943, 953 (2005). 
IV. DISCUSSION
 
A. Whether the Schmidts' Claim Was Time-Barred
 
We first consider the Appellees' argument on cross-
appeal that the Schmidts' fraudulent transfers claim was time-barred. The Schmidts' claim was brought pursuant to Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 651C, Hawai' i's Uniform Fraudulent 
Transfer Act (UFTA), specifically HRS § 651C-4(a)(1). HRS 
§ 651C-9 (1993) provides: 
§651C-9 Extinguishment of cause of action.  A cause of
 
action with respect to a fraudulent transfer or obligation
under this chapter is extinguished unless action is brought:
(1) Under section 651C-4(a)(1), within four years
after the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred
or, if later, within one year after the transfer or
obligation was or could reasonably have been discovered by
the claimant;
 . . . .
 
The allegedly fraudulent transfers were made in
 
February and March of 2000. The Schmidts' complaint was filed on
 
April 7, 2006. It is undisputed that the Schmidts' UFTA action
 
was not brought within four years after the transfers were made. 
The disputed issue is the statutory interpretation of the savings
 
clause of HRS § 651C-9(1), which extends the date for the
 
"extinguishment" of claims to "within one year after the transfer
 
or obligation was or could reasonably have been discovered by the
 
claimant".
 
It is uncontroverted that, on March 18, 2005, the
 
Schmidts received a Realty Finance bank account statement showing
 
that the four checks, which totaled $416,791.30, were disbursed
 
by Realty Finance in February of 2000, shortly after the
 
foreclosure proceeds were deposited into the account. Thus, on
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
March 18, 2005, the Schmidts discovered that the transfers
 
occurred. Appellees argue that the Schmidts' UFTA claim was
 
extinguished no later than one year from this date.7 The
 
Schmidts argue that, although they learned of the transfer on
 March 18, 2005, they did not discover the "fraudulent nature" of
 
the transfer until July 26, 2005, when they learned that the
 
effect of the transfers was to prevent them from recovery on
 
their judgment.
 
"It is a cardinal rule of statutory interpretation 
that, where the terms of a statute are plain, unambiguous and 
explicit, we are not at liberty to look beyond that language for 
a different meaning. Instead, our sole duty is to give effect to 
the statute's plain and obvious meaning." Bhakta v. Cnty. of 
Maui, 109 Hawai' i 198, 208, 124 P.3d 943, 953 (2005) (brackets 
provided and citation omitted). Courts should depart from the 
plain meaning of a statute, however, to avoid inconsistency, 
contradiction, and illogicality. Kinkaid v. Bd. of Review, 106 
Hawai'i 318, 323, 104 P.3d 905, 910 (2004) (citations omitted). 
Here, the savings clause in HRS § 651C-9(1) plainly,
 
unambiguously, and explicitly extends the four year time limit to
 no later than one year after the transfer has been discovered (or
 
reasonably should have been discovered). The term "transfer" is
 
specifically defined in HRS § 651C-1 to mean "every mode, direct
 
or indirect, absolute or conditional, voluntary or involuntary,
 
of disposing of or parting with an asset or an interest in an
 
asset, and includes a payment of money, a release, a lease, and
 
the creation of a lien or encumbrance." 
7
 Appellees also argue that the transfers "reasonably could have
been discovered" as early as August of 2004. However, it is unnecessary to
address that contention here.
 
8
     NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
This statute's identification of the "transfer" as the 
triggering event for extinguishment stands in sharp contrast with 
the language of Hawai' i's general tort statute of limitations (in 
HRS § 657-7), which begins to run when the plaintiff's "cause of 
action" accrues, i.e., when the plaintiff "discovers or should 
have discovered the negligent act, the damage, and the causal 
connection between the former and the latter." Yamaguchi v. 
Queen's Med. Ctr., 65 Haw. 84, 90, 648 P.2d 689, 693-94 (1982); see also Vidinha v. Miyaki, 112 Hawai' i 336, 341, 145 P.3d 879, 
884 (App. 2006). Nor does HRS § 651C-9 contain a further tolling provision, such as the ones contained in HRS §§ 657-7.3 
(applicable to medical torts) and 657-20 (applicable to all 
personal actions mentioned in Part I of HRS chapter 657 and 
wrongful death actions in HRS § 663-3). Had the Hawai' i 
Legislature intended to require knowledge of the "fraudulent nature" to trigger the UFTA statute of limitations, it could have 
included such language in its statute, as Arizona's legislature 
has done, but it did not. Compare A
RIZ. REV. STAT. ANN. § 44­
1009(1) with HRS § 651C-9(1). 
Although UFTA is a uniform act, there is no uniformity
 
in the interpretation of the "extinguishment" provision. As the
 Schmidts have urged, a number of courts have held that "the one
 
year period does not begin to run until the fraudulent nature of
 
the transfer is discovered or reasonably discoverable." In re
 
Maui Indus. Loan & Fin. Co., 454 B.R. 133, 137 (Bankr. D. Haw.
 2011) (citations omitted) (citing numerous cases adopting
 
"fraudulent nature of the transfer" as the trigger). However,
 
other jurisdictions have adopted the plain language reading of
 
the statute, with or without explanation. See, e.g., Fitness
 
Quest Inc. v. Monti, 2012 WL 3587491 (N.D. Ohio 2012), In re
 Ewbank, 359 B.R. 807, 810 (Bankr. D. N.M. 2007); In re Hill, 2004
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
WL 5694988 (M.D.Fla. 2004); Cadle Co. v. Wilson, 136 S.W.3d 345 
(Tex. Ct. App. 2004); Pereyron v. Leon Constantin Consulting, 
Inc., 2004 WL 1043724 (Del.Ch. 2004); Gulf Ins. Co. v. Clark, 304 
Mont. 264, 269, 20 P.3d 780, 783 (2001) (adopting a "plain 
meaning" interpretation); see also Salisbury v. Majesky, 817 
N.E.2d 1219, 1221-22 (Ill. App. Ct. 2004); Joslin v. Grossman, 
107 F. Supp. 2d 150, 155 (D. Conn. 2000); In re Earle, 307 B.R. 276, 290 (Bankr. S.D. Ala. 2002); Cunningham v. Gage, 686 S.E.2d 
800, 801 (Ga. Ct. App. 2009) (all simply calculating the time-bar 
from the date of the transfer). Some courts have observed that a 
significant difference between UFTA and the fraudulent conveyance 
act, which previously had been adopted in some jurisdictions, is 
that the fraudulent conveyance statute's savings clause expressly 
provided that the cause of action did not accrue until the 
discovery of the fraud. See, e.g., In re Spitaleri, 2006 WL 
4458357, at *2 (Bankr. N.D. Ohio 2006). In short, these differing views do not compel us to ignore the plain meaning of 
the Hawai' i statute. 
For these reasons, we conclude that the Schmidts' UFTA
 
claim was extinguished no later than one year after their
 
discovery of the transfers on March 18, 2005 and their April 7,
 
2006 complaint was untimely. Accordingly, we need not reach the
 
merits of the Schmidts' points of error contending that the
 
Circuit Court erred in otherwise rejecting their claims.
 
B. Appellees' Attorneys' Fees
 Appellees' motion for fees and costs was deemed denied
 
pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). On January 9, 2009, the Circuit
 
Court entered an order stating, inter alia, that the deemed
 
denial of Appellees' motion was due to an oversight by the
 
Circuit Court, that the Circuit Court was otherwise inclined to
 
grant in part the motion, and requesting that the matter be
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
remanded to allow the Circuit Court to rule on the matter. 
However, the Circuit Court never entered an order determining the 
amount of attorneys' fees and/or costs and the basis for such an 
award. Appellees' subsequent motions to this court for temporary 
remand to allow the Circuit Court to rule on Appellees' Hawai' i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 60 motion were denied 
without prejudice on February 10, 2009 and April 23, 2009. After 
having reviewed the briefing on this matter and the record on 
appeal, we conclude that this case should be remanded for the 
limited purpose of allowing the Circuit Court to enter a ruling 
on the substance of Appellees' request for attorneys' fees and 
costs. See Life of the Land v. Ariyoshi, 57 Haw. 249, 251, 553 
P.2d 464, 466 (1976) (per curiam); County of Hawaii v. C&J Coupe Family Ltd. P'ship, 119 Hawai' i 352, 367-68, 198 P.3d 615, 630-31 
(2008). V. CONCLUSION
 
We affirm the Circuit Court's October 7, 2008 Final
 
Judgment, but for the reasons stated herein. However, we remand
 
this case for a ruling on Appellees' request for attorneys' fees
 
and costs.
