IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
CHARLES MITCHELL HART AND LISA MARIE HART,
Plaintiffs-Appellants v. TICOR TITLE INSURANCE
COMPANY, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(CIVIL CASE NO. 1RC08-1-3865)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, Chief Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Plaintiffs-Appellants Charles Mitchell Hart and Lisa
 
Marie Hart (Harts) appeal from the Judgment entered on December
 
4, 2008, by the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu
 
Division, (District Court), which finalized, inter alia, the
 
District Court's November 13, 2008 Order Denying Plaintiffs'
 
1
Motion for Partial Summary Judgment Filed 10/21/08 (Order).  In
 
the Order, the District Court determined that Defendant-Appellee
 
Ticor Title Insurance Company (Ticor) did not have a duty to
 
defend the Harts in an underlying Land Court petition. 
On appeal, the Harts contend that: 
(1) the 
District Court erred in denying the Harts' partial summary
 
judgment motion on the basis that the State's escheat claim was a
 
routine reservation of possible rights and did not trigger

coverage under the subject title insurance policy; and (2) the
 
District Court erred in awarding attorney's fees and costs to
 
Ticor. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve the Harts' points of error as follows:
 
(1) "Escheat" is the "[r]eversion of property (esp. 
real property) to the state upon the death of an owner who has 
neither a will nor any legal heirs." Black's Law Dictionary 623 
(9th ed. 2009). Under Hawai' i law, a claim of escheat may be 
raised only in accordance with Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 665-1 
(1993). "In all cases where real property escheats by law to the 
State, the attorney general shall file an information in the 
circuit court of the first circuit, setting forth the facts upon 
which the claim of the State to the escheat is based." Id. 
Thus, to assert a claim of escheat, the State must file an action in the First Circuit Court setting forth the factual basis for 
escheat. Here, in a response to the Harts' Land Court petition 
to consolidate two parcels of land, the State included a pro 
forma reservation of any interest that may have escheated to the 
State; the State did not bring an action in the Circuit Court. 
The State set forth no facts in support of a claim of escheat. 
It made no demand for an escheated interest. The State's 
reservation of possible rights did not amount to a claim of an 
escheated interest. Rather, the State merely responded, in 
answer to the Harts' consolidation request, that it was not 
waiving, by its response, any claims based on escheat.
2 
Accordingly, the District Court did not err in concluding that Ticor had no duty to defend the Harts under the subject title 
insurance policy. 
2/
 Later in the consolidation proceeding, the State expressly
clarified that it had no escheat claim.

(2) The Harts argue that if this court vacates the
 
District Court's Judgment, we should also vacate the award of
 
attorney's fees and costs. They assert no other arguments in
 
favor of overturning the award of attorney's fees. Given our
 
disposition of the Harts' underlying claim, there is no basis for
 
disturbing the award. 
For these reasons, the District Court's December 4, 
2008 Judgment is affirmed.
