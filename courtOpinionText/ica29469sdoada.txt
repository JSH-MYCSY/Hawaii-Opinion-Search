NO. 29469
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
ERIN ACKERMAN, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(FC-CR. NO. 07-1-217K)
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley, and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Erin Ackerman (Ackerman) appeals 
from the October 28, 2008 Judgment filed in the Family Court of 
the Third Circuit (family court).1 The family court convicted 
Ackerman of Abuse of Family or Household Member, in violation of Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 709-906 (Supp. 2011). 
Ackerman's single point of error is that insubstantial
 
and/or insufficient evidence was presented to the family court,
 
such that it could not support a conclusion that Ackerman was a
 
"family or household member" for purposes of HRS § 709-906(1).
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised therein, we resolve
 
Ackerman's point on appeal as follows.

Ackerman was convicted for abuse of a family or
 
household member arising out of an incident with complaining
 
witness William Nami (Nami). HRS § 709-906(1) states in
 
pertinent part that, "[f]or the purposes of this section, 'family
 
or household member' means . . . persons jointly residing or
 
formerly residing in the same dwelling unit." (Emphasis added). 
When the sufficiency of evidence is challenged on
 
appeal, the test is whether there is substantial evidence to
 
support the conclusion of the trier of fact. See State v.
 
Matavale, 115 Hawai' i 149, 157-58, 166 P.3d 322, 330-31 (2007). 
[E]vidence adduced in the trial court must be considered in
the strongest light for the prosecution when the appellate
court passes on the legal sufficiency of such evidence to
support a conviction; the same standard applies whether the
case was before a judge or a jury. The test on appeal is
not whether guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt,
but whether there was substantial evidence to support the
conclusion of the trier of fact. Indeed, even if it could
be said in a bench trial that the conviction is against the
weight of the evidence, as long as there is substantial
evidence to support the requisite findings for conviction,
the trial court will be affirmed.
 
"Substantial evidence" as to every material element of
the offense charged is credible evidence which is of
sufficient quality and probative value to enable [a
person] of reasonable caution to support a conclusion.
And as trier of fact, the trial judge is free to make
all reasonable and rational inferences under the facts
 in evidence, including circumstantial evidence.
 
Id. (quoting State v. Batson, 73 Haw. 236, 248-49, 831 P.2d 924,
 
931 (1992)).
 
Ackerman contends the family court never found that she
 
and Nami were family or household members. However, Ackerman
 
fails to point to authority that would require the family court
 
to make an explicit finding that Ackerman is a "household
 
member." In addition, when denying Ackerman's oral motion for
 
judgment of acquittal, made by Ackerman after the State rested,
 
the family court rejected Ackerman's argument that the State had
 
not proven that Ackerman was a "family or household member."

Ackerman further argues that the testimony by Officer 
Paul Mangus (Mangus) should be disregarded because the testimony 
was presented without a determination of voluntariness as 
required by HRS § 621-26 (1993 Repl.). HRS § 621-26 states that 
"[n]o confession shall be received in evidence unless it is first 
made to appear to the judge before whom the case is being tried 
that the confession was in fact voluntarily made." Ackerman 
cites to State v. White, 1 Haw. App. 221, 224, 617 P.2d 98, 101 
(1980) and State v. Naititi, 104 Hawai' i 224, 233, 87 P.3d 893, 
902 (2004), which have held, in the context of a jury trial, that a trial judge has a duty to determine the admissibility of an 
inculpatory statement out of the presence of the jury and prior 
to the jury's exposure to such evidence. 
The essential purpose for holding a voluntariness 
hearing before admitting a defendant's confession is to avoid 
tainting the jury with evidence that may be found to be 
inadmissible. See State v. Goers, 61 Haw. 198, 199-201, 600 P.2d 
1142, 1143-44 (1979). However, in a bench trial, it is presumed that the trial judge is not influenced by incompetent evidence, 
State v. Vliet, 91 Hawai' i 288, 298, 983 P.2d 189, 199 (1999), 
and thus a voluntariness hearing is not required for bench trials, such as in this case. See State v. Filoteo, 125 Hawai' i 
240, 257 P.3d 253, No. 29921 2011 WL 2126149, at *4 (App. May 25, 2011) (SDO). 
Officer Mangus testified that on August 4, 2007, he was
 
responding to a dispatch of a domestic disturbance and as he was
 
driving down a street, he observed a vehicle heading in his
 
direction. The vehicle stopped and Ackerman got out. Officer
 
Mangus stopped his vehicle and Ackerman approached him. At that
 
point, Ackerman was not a suspect in the reported domestic
 
disturbance. According to Officer Mangus, Ackerman told him that
 
she had been grabbed in the neck by her boyfriend. Officer
 
Mangus had her fill out a domestic violence form. During this
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
time period, Ackerman also stated to Officer Mangus that she had
 
been living at Nami's residence. Officer Mangus testified that,
 
at the time, he could not tell who the initial aggressor was, and
 
that it was not until the end of the investigation and after he
 
questioned complainant Nami, that Ackerman was arrested.
 
Moreover, even if a determination of voluntariness was
 
appropriate, any error in the family court's failure to make an
 
explicit finding of voluntariness at a separate voluntariness
 
hearing was harmless, as it did not affect Ackerman's substantial
 
rights during this bench trial. The unrebutted evidence in the
 
record shows that Ackerman's statements to Mangus were made
 
voluntarily.
 
Considering all of the evidence at trial in the
 
strongest light for the prosecution, there was substantial
 
evidence that Ackerman was a "household member" pursuant to
 
HRS § 709-906(1). Officer Mangus testified that Ackerman "stated
 
she had been living at the residence of William Nami." Nami
 
testified that he had been dating Ackerman for about three months
 
and when asked whether he had been living with Ackerman for three
 
or four days, Nami responded: "Something like that. I may be off
 
a day or so, but it was brief. It was short." When asked a
 
second time whether Ackerman had been living with him for three
 
or four days, Nami responded "Yes." During cross-examination,
 
when asked again whether Ackerman had been living at the house,
 
Nami responded that "[s]he was in and out, yeah, for three days."
 
When asked yet again whether Ackerman had been living there, Nami
 
responded, "Well, I don't know, whatever you want to call it. 
She was there. She was in and out. She would come as she
 
pleased." Nami testified that Ackerman was not getting her mail
 
at the house, and that "[s]he was staying with girlfriends. She
 
actually did have a residence at that time. She was shacking up
 
with another chick." Nami testified that Ackerman had "brought a
 
bag of clothes there in a box. But most of her stuff was at this
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
other girl's house." Nami testified that he and Ackerman had
 
"woke up [the morning of the incident] together[.]"
 
There is no expressed minimum time requirement for
 
determining whether persons are "jointly residing or formerly
 
residing in the same dwelling unit." HRS § 709-906(1). In
 
addition, evidence that Ackerman may have also been living
 
elsewhere does not preclude a court from finding that Ackerman
 
was a "household member." In State v. Archuletta, 85 Hawai' i 
512, 946 P.2d 620 (App. 1997), this court stated, in relevant
 part: 
HRS § 709-906(1) requires that the defendant and the
victim had, at the time of the offense, past or present,
joint residence in the same dwelling unit. "Residence
implies something more than mere physical presence and
something less than domicile." Black's Law Dictionary 1309
 (6th ed. 1990) (citing Petition of Castrinakis, 179 F.Supp.
444, 445 (D.C. Md.)). "'Residence' is not synonymous with
'domicile,' though the two terms are closely related; a
person may have only one legal domicile at one time, but he
may have more that one residence." Black's Law Dictionary
 1309 (6th ed. 1990) (citing Fielding v. Casualty Reciprocal
 Exchange, 331 So.2d 186, 188 (La. App.)).
 
. . . 
The substantial evidence in the record that, at the time of
the abuse, Archuletta had two residences is not a defense.
The substantial evidence that one of Archuletta's two
 residences was Rosewell's dwelling unit at Lehua and Palm is
sufficient to support the implicit finding that, at the time
of the abuse, Archuletta and Rosewell were "persons jointly
residing or formerly residing in the same dwelling unit."
 
Id. at 514, 946 P.2d at 622 (emphasis added).
 
Given all of the evidence in this case, we conclude
 
there is substantial evidence that Ackerman was a household
 
member with Nami, thus supporting the family court's conviction
 
of Ackerman under HRS § 709-906(1).
