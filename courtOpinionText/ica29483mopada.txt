I. Background
 
A. Complaint
 On June 15, 2006, in the Circuit Court, Scudder filed
 
the Complaint against Defendants/Counterclaimants-Appellees Frank
 
Pierce, III ("Pierce") and Nancy Steinecke ("Steinecke")
 (collectively, "Lessees"), E Komo Mai Sport Horses, LLC ("E Komo
 Mai") (Lessees and E Komo Mai, collectively, "EKM Defendants"),
 and Defendants David W. Lacy ("Lacy") and Lacy and Jackson, LLLC
 (collectively, "Lacy Defendants") ("Complaint"). Scudder alleged
 as follows:
 
Prior to September 1, 1995, Lessees operated an 
equestrian-services business under the name E Komo Mai Sport Horses on property owned by Hawai' i Preparatory Academy ("HPA"), 
where they provided horse care and riding services to Scudder, among other clients. On or before September 1, 1995, Lessee's lease on the HPA property was terminated by HPA. 
On or before September 1, 1995, Gromel Partners, L.P.
 
("Gromel"), controlled by Scudder and her family members, owned
 approximately thirty acres of real property in North Kohala,
 adjacent to Scudder's own ranch and residence ("Subject
 Property"). Lessees inspected the Subject Property and informed
 Scudder that they would like to reside and operate their business
 there. Scudder told Lessees she did not know what to include in
 a legal agreement, but Pierce, who claimed that he was
 experienced with leases, offered to and did draft the original
 lease agreement between Gromel and the Lessees for use of the
 Subject Property ("Lease"). 
According to Scudder, the Lease consisted of a few
 
sentences and stated that Gromel leased the Subject Property to
 Lessees for a term of five years at $1,000.00 per month and that
 Lessees had an option for one additional five-year term. Scudder
 lost her copy of the Lease, but did not remember signing the
 standard form agreement that Pierce and Steinecke later claimed
 that she signed. 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
From September 1, 1995 until January 10, 2005, Lessees
 
cared for Scudder's horses, with Scudder paying only for feed and
 
any medication. From time to time, Lessees, claiming insolvency,
 would request that Scudder voluntarily pay or loan money to
 Lessees for various reasons, including purchasing a horse from
 Lessees, purchasing a truck for them, helping defray costs for
 maintaining Scudder's horses, and enabling Lessees to pay their
 taxes. 
In 1997, Steinecke, citing their financial condition,
 
asked Scudder if Lessees might defer rental payments
 indefinitely. Scudder agreed.
2 Lessees did not resume paying
 
monthly rent until February 2005. Furthermore, in 1999, Scudder
 paid $500,000 to construct an arena and improvements on the
 Subject Property for the benefit of Lessees' business. 
On March 15, 1998, Pierce presented Scudder with what
 
purported to be a written addendum to the Lease between Gromel,
 Pierce, and Steinecke, ("First Lease Amendment") which Scudder
 signed. The First Lease Amendment provided that as of August 31,
 2000, tenant had the option to renew the Lease for up to two
 additional five-year periods at a monthly rent of $1,000. On May
 9, 2005, Pierce presented Scudder with what purported to be two
 further written addenda to the Lease. The first was an addendum
 to the Lease between Gromel/Scudder, and Pierce and Steinecke,
 dba E Komo Mai Sports Horses ("Second Lease Amendment"), which
 Scudder signed. The second was an addendum to the Lease between
 Scudder, and Pierce and Steinecke, dba E. Komo Mai Sports Horses
 ("Third Lease Amendment"), which Scudder also signed. The Second
 and Third Lease Amendments differed only in the identity of the
 Lessor and provided that as of May 1, 2005, tenant had the option
 to renew the Lease for up to three five-year periods at a monthly
 rent of $1,000.
 
In February 2005, Lessees began to bill Scudder for the
 
boarding, care, and maintenance of her horses — in excess of
 
2
 According to testimony presented at trial, Steinecke thanked her
and said: "you don't have to pay anything any more," which Scudder understood
to mean that she no longer would be asked to pay for horse-related expenses
above out-of-pocket expenses.
 
3
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
$4,000.00 per month.3 Scudder objected, but paid the bills
 
through July 2005, after which time she refused to pay. In
 
response, Lessees refused to take care of Scudder's horses,
 showed Scudder alleged unsigned contracts for the care of her
 horses, and presented her with a bill for more than $150,000.00
 for caring for her horses for the previous ten years. 
Scudder's Complaint asserted the following counts,
4
 
some of which would properly be characterized as defenses rather
 than causes of action: (1) no contract formation, (2) contract
 invalid as a result of mistake, (3) fraud in the inducement, (4)
 summary possession, (5) fraud, (6) breach of fiduciary duty or
 confidential relations, (7) undue influence, (8) breach of
 contract, (9) unjust enrichment, (10) unfair and deceptive trade
 practices, (11) legal malpractice, and (12) punitive damages.
5
 
B. Counterclaim
 
On July 7, 2006, EKM Defendants filed a counterclaim
 
against Scudder ("Counterclaim"), alleging as follows: 
Between September 1995 and October 1998, Scudder
 
boarded her horses with EKM Defendants, agreeing to pay related
 
board and fees. During this time, Scudder received bills and
 paid for "all agreed upon additional charges" for her horses,
 
3
 Evidence presented at trial indicated that for a period of about
six years, beginning just before they moved from HPA to the Subject Property,
Lessees retained Ardis Kuniyoshi Ono to provide basic bookkeeping services to
help "organize [their] books." Ms. Ono was aware that Lessees had not been
 billing their clients for an extended period, "they did not keep records[,]"
and any records they kept "were not very good and they were certainly not
detailed." Ms. Ono had conversations with Steinecke and Pierce at the time
 about the fact that they were planning on sending out statements that were
more than a year old. According to Ms. Ono, "seeing as how they didn't keep
detailed records, I didn't think they should send that. I mean no good
business sends out statements that long." Ms. Ono warned Steinecke that "you
can't bill people for things like, oh, I held the horse at such and such date
when there was no detailed record that said that really." Ms. Ono noted that
 "[t]here came a point when they sent out bills and they were outrageous and
there was no way to check that all those services had been rendered."
Consistent with Ms. Ono's testimony, Scudder claimed to have had a
conversation with Pierce and Steinecke in the summer of 2004 in which Pierce
 stated that "not only did [the defendants] not have any books, but that they
had not done their books for a period of five or six years." 
4
 Scudder dismissed unenumerated conspiracy claims against all
defendants. 
5
 The claims against the Lacy Defendants were settled before trial. 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
including extra feed, treatment for injuries, handling for the
 
veterinarian, supplies, medications, trailering, grooming, hoof
 trimming, and lessons. From 1998, Scudder also paid for
 blanketing and unblanketing. Scudder received bills and paid for
 board and additional charges from October 1998 through December
 1999. 
From September 1995 to December 1999, EKM Defendants
 
paid rent to Scudder. However, in January 2000, Scudder and EKM
 Defendants reached an oral agreement whereby EKM Defendants' rent
 would be offset against Scudder's obligations related to the
 boarding and care of her horses. As of the date of the
 Counterclaim, EKM Defendants claimed that Scudder owed them more
 than $160,000.00. 
EKM Defendants asserted claims against Scudder for: (1)
 
breach of contract, (2) quantum meruit, (3) fraudulent
 inducement, (4) punitive damages, and (5) unfair and deceptive
 trade practices. 
C. Motion in Limine
 
On March 10, 2008, EKM Defendants filed several motions
 
in limine. The sixth motion ("Motion in Limine No. 6") included
 
a request for a Hawaii Rules of Evidence Rule 104 hearing, and
 sought an order barring Scudder from presenting any evidence
 and/or the testimony of proposed expert witness, Stewart H.
 Hussey ("Hussey"), "regarding incomplete and deficient appraisals
 and valuations at the trial in this case." Scudder proposed to
 present Hussey to testify about the rental value of the Subject
 Property. 
EKM Defendants argued that Motion in Limine No. 6
 
should be granted because Hussey's report stated that it was a
 "'preliminary report,'" that "'the results of this analysis are
 NOT considered a full, [Uniform Standards of Professional
 Appraisal Practice ("USPAP")] compliant appraisal,'" and that
 "'[t]his report is not suitable for lending or other purposes.'"
 In support, the EKM Defendants submitted a letter dated May 28,
 2007, from Hussey to Scudder's counsel, which urged counsel to
 "[p]lease consider this report a preliminary, 'essential
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
findings' report only. . . . I STRONGLY recommend converting
 
this basic market data into a full, USPAP-compliant rent survey
 report[.]" "Otherwise," Hussey warned, "an opposing attorney
 could undermine the credibility of the data herein in a
 deposition and/or cross examination procedures by pointing out
 how the report fails to comply with USPAP requirements."
 
On April 2, 2008, the Circuit Court granted Motion in
 
Limine No. 6 on the basis that the assignment that Hussey was
 given did not comply with USPAP and, although Hussey performed a
 follow-up investigation and inspection of the property, those
 results were not provided in any written supplemental report. 
D. Judgment as Matter of Law as to Steinecke
 
A trial was held before a jury. While legal claims
 
were presented for the jury's determination, equitable claims
 
were "submitted to the jury as an advisory jury as the trial
 court reserved the equitable issues for its determination." 
On April 9, 2008, Scudder rested her case. EKM
 
Defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law ("JMOL"). The
 Circuit Court granted the motion as to counts asserted against
 Steinecke for fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary duty,
 and unfair and deceptive trade practices, but, without giving any
 explanation for the different treatment, denied the motion as to
 Pierce and E Komo Mai. 
E. Special Verdict Form
 
With the jury limited to addressing Scudder's claims
 
against Pierce and E Komo Mai, it completed the Special Verdict
 
Form ("Verdict") on April 15, 2008. The jury found that (1)
 there was no meeting of the minds between Scudder and the EKM
 Defendants on the essential terms of a lease effective
 September 1, 1995; (2) there was no meeting of the minds between
 the EKM Defendants and Scudder on the essential terms of oral
 agreements for horse-care services; (3) Pierce engaged in unfair
 or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of his trade or
 commerce in connection with horse-care provided to Scudder; (4)
 Pierce breached his fiduciary or confidential relationship with
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Scudder and/or Grommel arising from the lease effective
 
September 1, 1995, the First Lease Amendment, the Second Lease
 Amendment, and the Third Lease Amendment; (5) Pierce fraudulently
 induced Scudder and/or Grommel to enter into the lease effective
 September 1, 1995, and three lease addenda; (6) EKM Defendants
 never repaid Scudder for a $15,000.00 loan in 2004 or a
 $25,000.00 loan in 2005; (7) EKM Defendants' horse-care-services
 agreement and written or oral lease agreements and addenda came
 within the Statute of Frauds; (8) Scudder waived rent; (9)
 Scudder ratified the Second Lease Amendment, but no other lease
 or addenda; and (10) the Third Lease Amendment was not a novation
 of the Lease. 
F.	 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order on
Equitable Claims
 
On May 5, 2008, EKM Defendants filed their motion
 
regarding equitable claims after jury verdict ("Motion on
 
Equitable Claims"). EKM Defendants argued that they were
 entitled to quantum meruit, seeking $161,052.62 for horse-care
 services; to extend the lease to 2020 per the jury's finding that
 Scudder ratified the Second Lease Amendment; and a ruling that
 Scudder waived the collection of rent. 
On September 5, 2008, the Circuit Court entered the
 
Order re Equitable Claims. The Circuit Court found, in pertinent
 part, that:
 
1. [Scudder] and [EKM] Defendants had entered in to a Lease
and various addenda ("Lease Agreements") commencing in
September of 1995 for [the Subject Property].
 
. . . .
 4. [Scudder] . . . Pierce and Steinecke were close personal
friends for many years with the common bond of training and
competing purebred horses on the Big Island of Hawaii, and
the business relationships between the parties were informal
and based on understandings for more than a ten (10) year
period.
 
5. [Scudder] boarded up to five (5) to six (6) horses with
[E Komo Mai], and by conduct paid for numerous services,
including but not limited to board, feed, medicines,
training, lessons, etc. ("horse care").
 
6. This relationship between the parties had continued for
many years, prior to September of 1995.
 7. [Scudder] and [EKM] Defendants continued with the Lease
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Agreements from 1995 until the present, and [Scudder]
through her course of conduct throughout years established
an understanding of the lease terms and ratified the
agreements.
 
8. The parties had a disagreement regarding billings for
horse care services claimed by [EKM] Defendants and
eventually [Scudder] claimed a dispute regarding the lease
arrangements.
 
9. In a letter dated July 9, 2005, [Scudder] set forth her
position regarding the gifts and arrangements of the parties
and acknowledged that she waived rent for the subject
property.
 
10. . . . Pierce and Steinecke testified and submitted
 
itemized entries recording the services provided to
[Scudder] for horse care services.
 
11. [EKM] Defendants testified that [Scudder] was advised
and was aware of the posted board rates for services that
were updated, and testified as to the amounts that were due
and owing.
 
12. [Scudder] acknowledged that she was aware of the posted
board rates related to horse care.
 13. [EKM] Defendants testified and claimed that [Scudder]
owed $161,052.62, and that the horse care services were
actually provided to [Scudder], the rates and services were
reasonable, and that [Scudder] knew that these services were
provided to her horses on her behalf.
 
14. [Scudder] did not dispute testimony that the horse care
services were actually provided to [Scudder], that the rates
and services were reasonable, or that she knew that these
services were provided to her horses on her behalf.
 
15. [Scudder] testified that she believed that she never
agreed to pay for these services, only for feed and
medicine, although [Scudder] paid for the disputed services
for a period of months.
 
16. . . . Pierce testified that in the billing for
$161,052.62, that $55,000.00 of that amount was for labor
provided by him alone, for work done on the horse arena,
unrelated to horse care.
 
17. The advisory jury expressly found that [Scudder] had waived
her right to the collection of any rent and at this time the Court
so finds.
 
18. The advisory jury found that [Scudder], as the new owner, or
in her individual capacity ratified the lease and [Second Lease
Agreement] and at this time the Court so finds.
 
(Citations omitted).
 
The Circuit Court made the following pertinent
 
conclusions of law:
 
3. Count II of the Counterclaim seeks $161,052.62 under a
theory of quantum meruit.
 
. . . .
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
6. [Scudder] testified that she took 4-6 horses to
Defendants, took riding lessons, and received boarding and
care for her horses for a period of at least five (5) years.
[Scudder] knew that these services were being provided to
her, and under cross examination did not contest that the
services were provided or that she had received the benefit
without paying for such benefit.
 
7. [Scudder] received the benefit of horse care for her
horse [sic] and it would be unjust for her to retain the
benefits conferred on her in this situation.
 
. . . .
 10. [Scudder] had advised Defendants in writing that she
had agreed to provide them with free rent for a period of
years.
 
11. The advisory jury had determined that there was a
waiver of rent by [Scudder] and this Court so adopts.
 . . . .
 14. The advisory jury found and this Court so adopts that
[Scudder], as the new owner, or in her individual capacity
ratified the lease and [Addendum 2].
 
(Citations omitted).
 
The Circuit Court therefore ordered:
 
1. $106,052.62 . . . is awarded to [EKM Defendants
Steinecke & E Komo Mai] for their equitable claim in quantum
 
meruit for unjust enrichment for horse care services; and,
 
2. [Scudder] is not entitled to any past rent having waived
her right to collect rent until entry of final judgment in
this case; and,
 
3. [Scudder] and [EKM] Defendants have an agreement
involving the subject property as [Scudder] ratified [the
Second Lease Agreement] setting rent at $1,000.00 . . . per
month until the year 2020; and,
 
4. The Court denies all other claims/defenses/counterclaims
with prejudice.
 
G. Final Judgment
 
On September 8, 2008, the Circuit Court filed the Final
 
Judgment, entering judgment in favor of Scudder on her breach-of­
contract claim for $40,000.00 and entering judgment in favor of
 Scudder and against Pierce on the unfair-and-deceptive-trade­practices claim but without a monetary award. The Circuit Court
 also entered judgment on the equitable claims consistent with the
 Order re Equitable Claims. 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
H. Attorneys' Fees and Costs
 
On September 22, 2008, Scudder filed her Rule 54(d), 
Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure motion for attorney's fees and 
costs ("Fees and Costs Motion") pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of 
Civil Procedure ("HRCP") Rule 54(d) and various statutory provisions. Scudder argued that she was the prevailing party and was entitled to $315,947.26 in attorneys' fees and $40,399.88 in costs. 
The Order Granting in Part Fees and Costs granted the
 
Fees and Costs Motion in part as to Scudder's breach-of-contract
 claim but denied it as to the remainder. The order did not state
 how much money was awarded to Scudder.
 
II. Points of Error
 
On appeal, Scudder contends that the Circuit Court
 
erred in (A) granting JMOL in favor of Steinecke, (B) granting
 
equitable relief that was inconsistent with the jury's verdict,
 (C) granting the Motion in Limine, and (D) partially denying
 Scudder's motion for attorneys' fees and costs. 
III. Standards of Review
 
Judgment as a matter of law
 
"A trial court's ruling on a motion for judgment as a
 
matter of law is reviewed de novo." Ray v. Kapiolani Med.
 
Specialists, 125 Hawai' i 253, 261, 259 P.3d 569, 577 (2011) 
(citing Miyamoto v. Lum, 104 Hawai' i 1, 6-7, 84 P.3d 509, 514-15 
(2004)). 
A motion for judgment as a matter of law may be granted only
when after disregarding conflicting evidence, giving to the
non-moving party's evidence all the value to which it is
legally entitled, and indulging every legitimate inference
which may be drawn from the evidence in the non-moving
party's favor, it can be said that there is no evidence to
support a jury verdict in his or her favor.

Equitable relief
 
"The relief granted by a court in equity is 
discretionary and will not be overturned on review unless the 
circuit court abused its discretion by issuing a decision that clearly exceeds the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of the appellant." Aickin v. Ocean View Invs. Co., 84 Hawai' i 447, 453, 
935 P.2d 992, 998 (1997) (quoting AIG Hawai' i Ins. Co. v. 
Bateman, 82 Hawai' i 453, 457, 923 P.2d 395, 398 (1996)) (brackets 
omitted). 
Findings of Fact
 
Findings of fact are reviewed under the clearly 
erroneous standard. Id. (citing Dan v. State, 76 Hawai' i 423, 
428, 879 P.2d 528, 533 (1994). 
Evidentiary rulings
 
Different standards of review must be applied to trial
court decisions regarding the admissibility of evidence,
depending on the requirements of the particular rule of
evidence at issue. When application of a particular
evidentiary rule can yield only one correct result, the
proper standard for appellate review is the right/wrong
standard.

IV.	 Discussion6
 
A.	 Scudder's breach-of-fiduciary-duty, unfair-or­
deceptive-trade-practices, and fraudulent-inducement
claims
 
Scudder argues that the Circuit Court erred in granting
 
JMOL to Steinecke on Scudder's breach-of-fiduciary-duty, unfair­
or-deceptive-trade-practices, and fraudulent-inducement claims
 
6
 Scudder's opening brief addresses a multitude of disparate
arguments, many of which appear incomplete, lack substance, or fail to comply
with Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure ("HRAP") Rule 28(b)(7). We attempt
to discern and address those arguments where possible. 
11
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
after the conclusion of Scudder's case-in-chief when it denied
 
JMOL to Pierce on those same claims. Scudder presents several
 facts that she contends show that Steinecke played a role in the
 allegedly fraudulent or tortious conduct. 
Here, for Scudder to show that the Circuit Court erred
 
in granting Steinecke JMOL on the breach-of-fiduciary-duty claim,
 she would have had to show that, viewing the evidence in a light
 most favorable to Scudder, Scudder had established a prima facie
 case against Steinecke for breach of fiduciary duty. Scudder,
 however, does not provide any analysis showing that the evidence
 was sufficient to establish a prima facie case against Steinecke
 for breach of fiduciary duty; instead, Scudder merely cites to
 facts in the record that suggest that Steinecke was a central
 character in Scudder's overall theory of the case. This is
 insufficient to show that the Circuit Court erred in granting
 JMOL on this claim against Steinecke, and we decline to construct
 Scudder's arguments for her.
 
Scudder, however, has established that the Circuit 
Court erred in granting Steinecke JMOL on the unfair-or­deceptive-trade-practices claim. "Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are unlawful." H
AW. REV. STAT. § 480-2(a) 
(2008). An act or practice is unfair "when it offends established public policy and when the practice is immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers." Balthazar v. Verizon Haw., Inc., 109 Hawai' i 69, 77, 
123 P.3d 194, 202 (2005). A deceptive act or practice is: "(1) a representation, omission, or practice that (2) is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances where (3) the representation, omission, or practice is material." Tokuhisa v. Cutter Mgmt. Co., 122 Hawai' i 181, 195, 223 P.3d 246, 
260 (App. 2009) (quoting Courbat v. Dahana Ranch, Inc., 111 Hawai'i 254, 262, 141 P.3d 427, 435 (2006)) (internal quotation 
marks and brackets omitted). "A representation, omission, or practice is considered 'material' if it involves 'information that is important to consumers and, hence, likely to affect their choice of, or conduct regarding, a product.'" Courbat, 111

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawai'i at 262, 141 P.3d at 435 (quoting Novartis Corp. v. FTC, 
223 F.3d 783, 786 (D.C. Cir. 2000)). 
Viewing the evidence in the strongest light possible
 
for Scudder, as we must, Scudder presented sufficient evidence
 
for a jury to conclude that Steinecke utilized unfair or
 deceptive trade practices "by billing for horse care services
 never agreed to years after they were performed." See Columbia
 
Chiropractic Grp., Inc. v. Trust Ins. Co., 712 N.E.2d 93, 96
 (Mass. 1999) (inappropriate and unreasonable billing held to be
 unfair or deceptive acts or practices).
 
According to Scudder, in 1997, Steinecke asked Scudder
 
for rent deferment and, when Scudder agreed, told her: "you don't
 have to pay anything any more." Consistent with that, until
 February 2005, Scudder claimed that she received no bills for
 payment from the EKM Defendants. In the summer of 2004, Scudder
 had a conversation with Pierce and Steinecke in which Pierce
 stated that "not only did [the EKM Defendants] not have any
 books, but that they had not done their books for a period of
 five or six years." Nevertheless, in the spring of 2005, Scudder
 began receiving invoices from the EKM Defendants in excess of
 $4,500 each month "for charges that I had never agreed to and I
 felt that I was being cheated." On July 9, 2005, Scudder sent
 the defendants a letter objecting to the charges. 
According to Scudder, Pierce and Steinecke approached
 
her in July after receiving the letter and explained that they
 had been charging her for services but not billing her. Scudder
 asked, "Are you telling me you're charging me to keep my horses
 there and at the same rate as the people who've given you
 nothing?" According to Scudder, Pierce responded, "Well, yeah." 
When Scudder complained that Pierce and Steinecke had "been
 living for free on my family's land and now you're telling me
 you're charging me to keep my horses there?" Pierce responded,
 "Oh, we haven't been living there for free. We've been paying
 you rent all along." When Scudder questioned what he meant, and
 despite having told Scudder that they had no books and had not
 done their books for five to six years, Pierce explained, "Oh,
 we've been doing it in our books." Scudder testified that
 
13
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Steinecke was not only present at the aforementioned meeting, but
 
that she followed up with Scudder via email, explaining that she
 and Pierce were continuing to bring their accounts and paperwork
 up to date. 
A reasonable jury could conclude from the evidence 
presented that Steinecke was involved in a representation, omission, or practice that was likely to mislead Scudder, acting reasonably under the circumstances, into believing that she would not be charged for all of the horse-care services provided to her at full cost. See Tokuhisa, 122 Hawai' i at 195, 223 P.3d at 260. 
A jury could likewise find that Steinecke's acts were "unfair." See Balthazar, 109 Hawai' i at 77, 123 P.3d at 202. Such 
conclusions are all the more possible because that same jury found that there was no meeting of the minds between the parties on the essential terms of oral agreements for horse-care services and that Pierce, who Steinecke worked with in billing Scudder, had engaged in unfair or deceptive acts or practices in connection with the horse-care services provided to Scudder. Thus, we hold that the Circuit Court erred by granting Steinecke JMOL on Scudder's unfair-or-deceptive-trade-practice claim. 
Furthermore, the Circuit Court erred by granting 
Steinecke JMOL on the fraudulent-inducement claim. A fraudulent-inducement claim requires "(1) a representation of a material fact, (2) made for the purpose of inducing the other party to act, (3) known to be false but reasonably believed true by the other party, and (4) upon which the other party relies and acts to [his or her] detriment." Pancakes of Haw., Inc. v. Pomare 
Props. Corp., 85 Hawai' i 300, 312, 944 P.2d 97, 109 (App. 1997) 
(brackets in original) (quoting Honolulu Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. Murphy, 7 Haw. App. 196, 201, 753 P.2d 807, 811 (1988)). As
 stated above, Scudder testified that Steinecke told Scudder her,
 "you don't have to pay for anything anymore." Given the
 circumstances in which this statement was allegedly made, a
 factfinder could reasonably conclude that Steinecke induced
 Scudder to continue to utilize EKM Defendants' services after
 leading Scudder to reasonably believe that she would not be
 charged for such services. Therefore, the Circuit Court erred in
 
14
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
granting JMOL in favor of Steinecke on the unfair-or-deceptive­
trade-practices and fraudulent-inducement claims.
 
B.	 Steinecke and E Komo Mai's entitlement to quantum
meruit
 
The Circuit Court awarded Steinecke and E Komo Mai
 
$106,052.62 in quantum meruit for horse-care services, held that
 
Scudder waived her right to unpaid rent until the entry of the
 Final Judgment, and held that Scudder and EKM Defendants have an
 agreement setting rent at $1,000.00 per month until 2020 because
 Scudder ratified the Second Lease Amendment. Scudder claims that
 the Circuit Court erred by providing Steinecke and E Komo Mai an
 award in quantum meruit and in concluding that the Lease had been
 extended to 2020. We agree with Scudder as to the award in
 quantum meruit and disagree as to the Lease extension.
 
1.	 Quantum meruit
 
"Quantum meruit is an equitable claim." Wagner v. 
World Botanical Gardens, Inc., 126 Hawai' i 190, 203, 268 P.3d 
443, 456 (App. 2011). As a general matter, "[t]he basis of recovery on quantum meruit is that a party has received a benefit from another which it is unjust for him to retain without paying therefor." Haw. Ventures, LLC v. Otaka, Inc., 114 Hawai' i 438, 
484, 164 P.3d 696, 742 (2007) (quoting Maui Aggregates, Inc. v. Reeder, 50 Haw. 608, 610, 446 P.2d 174, 176 (1968)). "[I]f a party derives any benefit from services rendered by another, the law reasonably implies a promise to pay on the part of the one who has received such benefit, such amount as it is reasonably worth." Id. (quoting Maui Aggregates, 50 Haw. at 610, 446 P.2d 
at 176). 
Here, the Circuit Court found that Scudder received the
 
benefit of horse care and that it would be unjust for her to
 retain this benefit, awarding Steinecke and E Komo Mai
 $106,052.62. To the extent that the Circuit Court erroneously
 granted JMOL to Steinecke on the unfair-or-deceptive-trade­practice claim relating to deceptive billing practices and the
 fraudulent-inducement claim, as we hold above, the granting of
 
15
  
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
equitable relief in favor of Steinecke must be vacated.
 
Furthermore, the equitable award in favor of E Komo Mai
 
must be vacated and the cause remanded for further findings and
 
conclusions of law. A business association has unclean hands,
 for the purpose of denying equitable relief, if "persons
 exercising general control over its affairs" have knowledge of
 the inequitable conduct of those acting on its behalf. See
 
Associated Press v. Int'l News Serv., 240 F. 983, 989 (S.D.N.Y.
 1917) (Augustus Noble Hand, J.), modified, 245 F. 244 (2d Cir.
 1917), aff'd, 248 U.S. 215 (1918). While the jury found that
 Pierce had engaged in unfair or deceptive acts involving his
 provision of horse-care services, neither the jury nor the
 Circuit Court found the extent to which such misconduct could be
 attributed to E Komo Mai.
7 Thus, the equitable award in favor of
 
both Steinecke and E Komo Mai must be vacated and the case
 remanded for additional proceedings.
 
Scudder further argues that HRS § 480-12 bars equitable
 
relief. Indeed, "[a]ny contract or agreement in violation of
 this chapter is void and is not enforceable at law or in equity." 
H
AW. REV. STAT. § 480-12 (2008). Based on the findings of the
 
jury and the Circuit Court, however, it is not clear exactly
 which services provided to Scudder, for which the Circuit Court
 also provided an equitable award, were the product of a contract
 or agreement in violation of HRS § 480-12. This is a question
 for adjudication on remand.
8
 
2. Second Lease Amendment
 
Scudder argues that the Circuit Court erred in finding,
 
among other things, that Scudder entered into or ratified the
 
7
 Furthermore, based on our decision today, Steinecke's own alleged
misconduct relating to billing, if confirmed by the factfinder, could affect
the determination of E Komo Mai's entitlement to equitable relief.
 
8
 Scudder also argues that "quantum meruit damages require an
agreement, albeit unenforceable, for the services provided." Quantum meruit,
however, involves a quasi-contractual relationship. B
LACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 1361­
62 (9th ed. 2009). But, a quasi-contract "is not a contract at all, but an
obligation imposed by the court to bring about justice and equity, without
regard to the intent of the parties and without regard to whether they have an
 agreement[.]" 1 W
ILLISTON ON CONTRACTS § 1:6 (4th ed. 2012) (emphasis added).
 
16
    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
1995 lease and various addenda where the jury found that Scudder
 
had only ratified the Second Lease Amendment. Scudder also
 argues that the extension of the lease until 2020 was error where
 the jury found that Scudder was fraudulently induced into signing
 the Second Lease Amendment.
 
Ratification is "[a] person's binding adoption of an
 
act already completed but . . . not done in a way that originally
 produced a legal obligation." B
LACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 1376 (9th ed.
 
2009) (emphasis added). Ratification "is a question of fact for
 jury determination." Guaschino v. Eucalyptus, Inc., 3 Haw. App.
 
632, 640, 658, P.2d 888, 895 (1983). 
Here, the jury found that Plaintiff ratified the Second
 
Lease Amendment, which states: "AS OF MAY 1, 2005, TENANT HAS THE
 OPTION TO RENEW THIS LEASE FOR UP TO 3 FIVE YEAR PERIODS AT A
 MONTHLY RENT OF $1000.00. THIS AGREEMENT SUPERSEDES ANY PREVIOUS
 AGREEMENT REGARDING LENTGH [sic] OF RENTAL TERM." While Scudder
 argues that the jury, in essence, was misled by EKM Defendants'
 counsel into finding that Scudder ratified the Second Lease
 Amendment, Scudder does not challenge any of the Circuit Court's
 jury instructions as being incorrect and otherwise does not
 establish that the jury was actually misled. Furthermore,
 Scudder fails to address the significance, or even the terms, of
 the Second Lease Amendment in either her opening or reply briefs. 
Without this analysis, Scudder fails to show that the Circuit
 Court committed reversible error in extending the lease to 2020. 
Thus, Scudder has not demonstrated reversible error.
 
C. Hussey's testimony
9
 
Scudder argues that the Circuit Court erred in
 
excluding expert testimony on Hussey's preliminary findings
 regarding relevant market values of the Subject Property. 
Pursuant to HRE Rule 702:
 
9
 Appellees urge us to deny Scudder's USPAP argument on its face
because Scudder did not identify the order granting Motion in Limine No. 6 in
her notice of appeal. That order, however, was an unappealable interlocutoryorder that relates directly to the order from which Scudder appealed.Therefore, we will address Scudder's argument with regard to Motion in Limine
No. 6. See Haw. R. App. P. 4(a)(3); Ueoka v. Szymanski, 107 Hawai' i 386, 396,
114 P.3d 892, 902 (2005). 
17
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge
will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or
 to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an
expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or
education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or
otherwise. In determining the issue of assistance to the
trier of fact, the court may consider the trustworthiness
and validity of the scientific technique or mode of analysis
employed by the proffered expert.
 
Haw. R. Evid. 702. "[T]he touchstones of admissibility for 
expert testimony under HRE Rule 702 are relevance and reliability." State v. Vliet, 95 Hawai' i 94, 106, 19 P.3d 42, 54 
(2001). The Circuit Court rejected Scudder's attempt to have Hussey testify on the results of his preliminary reports because it apparently found that such reports were unreliable because they were not USPAP compliant. 
"[W]e apply an abuse of discretion standard when
 
reviewing a trial court's decision regarding the reliability of
 expert testimony." Id. at 108, 19 P.3d at 56. In this case, we
 
hold that the Circuit Court abused its discretion in prohibiting
 Hussey from testifying due to non-compliance with USPAP.
 
"It is well established in this jurisdiction that a 
witness having the necessary qualifications may give an opinion as to the value of property." Chung v. Kaonohi Ctr. Co., 62 Haw. 
594, 609, 618 P.2d 283, 293 (1980), abrogated on other grounds by Francis v. Lee Enters., Inc., 89 Hawai' i 234, 971 P.2d 707 
(1999). "The factors considered and the extent of knowledge and reasoning of an otherwise qualified appraiser are matters which go to the weight rather than the competence of his testimony." State v. Dillingham Corp., 60 Haw. 393, 411, 591 P.2d 1049, 1060 (1979) (brackets omitted) (quoting State ex rel. Kobayashi v. Heirs of Kapahi, 48 Haw. 101, 114, 395 P.2d 932, 940 (1979)); see also State v. Fukagawa, 100 Hawai' i 498, 504, 60 P.3d 899, 905 
(2002) ("Once the basic requisite qualifications are established, the extent of an expert's knowledge of the subject matter goes to the weight rather than the admissibility of the testimony." (quoting State v. Toyomura, 80 Hawai' i 8, 26 n.19, 904 P.2d 893, 
911 n.19 (1995)). 
In making its evidentiary ruling, the Circuit Court
 
specifically stated that it was "not addressing Mr. Hussey's
 
18
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
expertise but his written report as submitted." However, we
 
agree with the U.S. Court of Appeal for the Fifth Circuit that an
 appraiser's compliance with USPAP is not "the sole determining
 factor as to whether an appraiser's valuation report is
 reliable." See Whitehouse Hotel Ltd. P'ship v. Comm'r, 615 F.3d
 
321, 332 (5th Cir. 2010). As non-compliance with USPAP was the
 stated basis upon which the Circuit Court granted Motion in
 Limine No. 6, the Circuit Court's ruling constituted an abuse of
 discretion.
 
D.	 The deemed denial of the Fees and Costs Motion is
 
vacated
 
"A post-judgment order is an appealable final order 
under HRS § 641-1(a) if the order ends the proceedings, leaving 
nothing further to be accomplished." Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 
Hawai'i 153, 157, 80 P.3d 974, 978 (2003). However, "an order is 
not final if the rights of a party involved remain undetermined or if the matter is retained for further action." Cho v. State, 
115 Hawai' i 373, 383, 168 P.3d 17, 27 (2007) (quoting Bocalbos v. 
Kapiolani Med. Ctr. for Women & Children, 89 Hawai' i 436, 439, 
974 P.2d 1026, 1029 (1999)) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
On September 22, 2008, Scudder filed her Fees and Costs
 
Motion pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(d) and various statutory
 provisions. While the Order Granting in Part Fees and Costs
 purported to grant the motion as to Scudder's breach-of-contract
 claim but denied it as to the remainder, the Circuit Court did
 not say how much money, if any, it was awarding to Scudder. 
Thus, the Order Granting in Part Fees and Costs is not a final
 and appealable order. Instead, as no order was entered that
 fully disposed of the Fees and Costs Motion, the Fees and Costs
 Motion was deemed denied ninety days after it was filed pursuant
 to rule. See Haw. R. App. P. 4(a)(3).
 Scudder argues that the Circuit Court erred in denying
 
her fees and costs based on HRS §§ 480-13(b) and 481A-4(b). Due
 to our holding that the Circuit Court erred in granting JMOL to
 Steinecke on Scudder's unfair-or-deceptive-trade-practice and
 fraudulent-inducement claims, vacating the equitable award in
 
19
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
quantum meruit in favor of Steinecke and E Komo Mai, and
 
remanding for further proceedings, we vacate the deemed denial of
 the Fees and Costs Motion.
