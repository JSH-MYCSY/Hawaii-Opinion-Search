APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 05-1-2246)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Third-Party Defendant/Appellant Eric Y. Marn (Marn)
 
appeals pro se from two orders entered by the Circuit Court of
 
the First Circuit (Circuit Court): (1) the August 6, 2008 Order
 
Granting Third-Party Defendant Eric Marn's Second Motion to
 
Continue the Trial Date Filed July 8, 2008 (Order Granting
 
Continuance); and (2) the October 29, 2008 Order Denying Third-
Party Defendants' Motion for Reconsideration In Part Re: Order
 
Granting Third-Party Defendant Eric Marn's Second Motion to
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Continue Trial Date Filed July 8, 2008 (Filed August 6, 2008),
 
Filed August 18, 2008 (Order Denying Reconsideration).1
 
Marn's Opening Brief fails to identify points of error, 
exceeds the maximum number of pages, fails to provide the 
required references to the record on appeal, and otherwise fails 
to meet the requirements of Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
(HRAP) 28. We nevertheless attempt to address the issues raised 
by Marn, including: (1) whether Intervenors-Defendants/Third-
Party Plaintiffs/Appellees Jerry Tarutani and Huo Chen, Co-
Trustees of the Gregory Y. Dunn Irrevocable Trust Dated 
December 17, 1993; Roger Y.H. Dunn Irrevocable Trust Dated 
December 17, 1993; Laurieann Y.F. Dunn Irrevocable Trust Dated 
December 17, 1993; and Micheal Y.H. Dunn Irrevocable Trust Dated 
December 17, 1993 (the Dunn Trusts) are proper appellees in this 
proceeding; (2) whether the Circuit Court abused its discretion 
by requiring Marn to remit the cost of a non-refundable airline 
ticket to its purchaser, non-party and named witness James Dunn, 
as a condition to granting Eric Marn's Second Motion to Continue 
Trial Date; and (3) whether the Circuit Court abused its 
discretion by denying Marn's subsequent Motion for 
Reconsideration, which challenged the imposition of that 
condition. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Marn's points of error as follows:
 
(1) Marn is the Appellant. Pursuant to HRAP 2.1 and
 
3(d), all other named parties in the lower court proceeding,
 
which expressly include "intervenor[s]," are denominated
 
"appellees." Therefore, the Dunn Trusts, in their capacity as
 
intervening defendants to the Amended Complaint and intervening
 
third-party plaintiffs in the Cross-Claim action, are plainly
 
1

2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"appellees" under our governing rules. See S. Utsunomiya
 
Enterprises, Inc. v. Moomuku Country Club, 75 Haw. 480, 493, 866
 
P.2d 951, 959 (1994) ("Appellee-designations are automatically
 
determined pursuant to HRAP 3(d)..."). Although the parties
 
below stipulated to substitute Ronald Kotoshirodo as the third-
party plaintiff in the Third-Party Action (in lieu of the Dunn
 
Trusts), the Dunn Trusts remained as (1) additional intervening
 
defendants to the Amended Complaint, and (2) intervening third-
party plaintiffs in the Cross-Claim Action. The Dunn Trusts are
 
properly denominated as appellees.
 
(2) Marn contends that the Circuit Court abused its
 
discretion by imposing upon him the cost of a trial witness's
 
non-refundable airline ticket, as a condition for granting his
 
Second Motion to Continue Trial Date.
 Courts have "inherent equity, supervisory, and 
administrative powers as well as inherent power to control the 
litigation process before them.2" Richardson v. Sport Shinko 
(Waikiki Corp.), 76 Hawai' i 494, 507, 880 P.2d 169, 182 (1994). 
"Although a moving party is usually confined to the relief 
requested in his motion, a trial court has the inherent power, 
subject to limitations on its jurisdiction, to grant, deny, grant 
in part or grant alternative or appropriate relief." Makani Dev. 
Co., Ltd. v. Stahl, 4 Haw. App. 542, 547, 670 P.2d 1284, 1288 
2
 While a court's inherent powers are not confined by or dependent
on statute, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 603-21.9(6) (1993) represents a
legislative restatement of the inherent powers doctrine. See Richardson, 76 
Hawai'i at 507-508 n. 15, 880 P.2d at 182-183 n. 15 (citation omitted). That 
section provides that: 
§ 603-21.9. Powers.  The several circuit courts shall have
 
power:
 
. . . .
 (6) 	To make and award such judgments, decrees, orders, and
mandates, issue such executions and other processes, and do
such other acts and take such other steps as may be
necessary to carry into full effect the powers which are or
shall be given to them by law or for the promotion of
justice in matters pending before them. 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(App. 1983) (citation omitted); c.f. Farmer v. Admin. Dir. of 
Court, State of Haw., 94 Hawai' i 232, 240, 11 P.3d 457, 465 
(2000) ("[a]mong courts' inherent powers are the powers to create a remedy for a wrong even in the absence of specific statutory 
remedies[.]") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted, 
brackets in original). This particular exercise of inherent 
power may be exercised sua sponte. See Stahl, 4 Haw. App. at 
547, 670 P.2d at 1287. 
We conclude that the Circuit Court possessed the
 
inherent power to fashion "alternative or appropriate relief" in
 adjudicating the Second Motion to Continue Trial Date, including
 
the imposition of a condition on the requested trial continuance. 
See Stahl, 4 Haw. App. at 547, 670 P.2d at 1288 (affirming trial
 
court's inherent power to impose monetary conditions on granting
 
requested relief). It appears that the Circuit Court rescheduled
 
trial on the Third-Party Action, on three separate occasions –
 
the latter two continuances flowing from Marn's health-related
 
issues. While there is nothing to indicate that Marn, in either
 
instance, moved for the requested relief for an improper purpose
 
or in bad faith, the fact remains that both motions to continue
 
were filed unexpectedly, and in the case of the Second Motion to
 
Continue Trial Date, mere days prior to trial. Mr. Dunn, a
 
California resident, had been formally named as a witness at the
 
July 14, 2008 trial and had pre-purchased his airline ticket
 
prior to Marn's July 8, 2008 Second Motion to Continue Trial
 
Date. The Circuit Court fashioned alternative relief to
 
accommodate Mr. Marn's legitimate medical-related request, while
 
also addressing the expense incurred by Mr. Dunn in anticipation
 
of a July 14, 2008 trial, which had already been rescheduled
 
twice. Marn failed to demonstrate that, under the circumstances
 
of this case, this condition constituted an abuse of discretion. 
(3) Marn's contention that the Circuit Court abused
 
its discretion by denying his motion for reconsideration, in
 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
which he argued that the monetary condition was impermissible, is
 
without merit.
 
We affirm.
