SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise and Leonard, JJ.;
and Nakamura, Chief Judge, dissenting)
 
Plaintiffs-Appellants Georgie-Ann Goto, individually
 
and as Guardian of the Property of Bowen Goto, a minor, Alan
 
Goto, individually and as Personal Representative of the Estate
 
of Ryan Goto, Deceased, (Officer Goto), David Bega, Paul Javier,
 
Lon Williams, individually and as Personal Representative of the
 
Estate of Alacia Williams, Deceased, (Alacia), and Karin Williams
 
(Williams; collectively, Plaintiffs) appeal from the Circuit
 Court of the First Circuit's (Circuit Court's) Final Judgment,
 filed on November 20, 2008.
1 After the completion of a
 
consolidated non-jury trial on liability in Civil Nos. 05-1-0846Â­

 The Honorable Eden Elizabeth Hifo presided.

05, 05-1-0883-05, 05-1-0947-05, and 05-1-1045-05, the Final 
Judgment was entered in favor of the State of Hawai' i (State) 
against all Plaintiffs, with the Circuit Court dismissing all 
other claims, counterclaims, cross-claims, and third-party 
claims. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law (FOF/COL) were 
entered by the Circuit Court on January 17, 2008. 
On appeal, Plaintiffs raise four points of error:
 
(1) The Circuit Court clearly erred in FOFs 64 through
 
67, when it found that a properly installed median barrier would
 have stopped short of the accident location and thus would not
 
have prevented the accident, and therefore erred in concluding,
 
in COL C, that "the State's negligent failure to have installed a
 
median barrier in the vicinity of the accident prior to the
 
subject accident was not a substantial factor in causing the
 
subject accident. Plaintiffs failed to prove legal causation by
 
a preponderance of the evidence."
 
(2) The Circuit Court clearly erred in FOFs 61, 63,
 
and 64, when it failed to adopt the proper engineering standard,
 
and used an inapposite standard, thereby leading to the court's
 
erroneous conclusion that Plaintiffs failed to prove legal
 
causation by a preponderance of the evidence. 
(3) The Circuit Court clearly erred in FOF 66, when it
 
found that the stopping sight distance for 45 mph design speed is
 
375 feet and is the likely distance that a median barrier would
 
have extended east of the left-turn pocket based upon reasonable
 
and prudent engineering standards.
 
(4) The Circuit Court abused its discretion in denying
 
Plaintiffs' motions for reconsideration based on the above-
referenced errors.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Plaintiffs' contentions as follows:
 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"It is well-settled that an appellate court will not 
pass upon issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and 
the weight of evidence; this is the province of the trier of 
fact." Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawai' i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 
(2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also, e.g., Tamashiro v. Control Specialist, Inc., 97 Hawai' i 86, 92, 
34 P.3d 16, 22 (2001); State v. Mattiello, 90 Hawai' i 255, 259, 
978 P.2d 693, 697 (1999); Porter v. Hu, 116 Hawai' i 42, 59-60, 
169 P.3d 994, 1011-12 (App. 2007). 
Findings of fact are reviewed under the clearly 
erroneous standard. Bhakta v. Cnty. of Maui, 109 Hawai' i 198, 
208, 124 P.3d 943, 953 (2005) (citations omitted). 
A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when, despite
evidence to support the finding, the appellate court is left
with the definite and firm conviction in reviewing the
entire evidence that a mistake has been committed. A finding
of fact is also clearly erroneous when the record lacks
substantial evidence to support the finding. We have defined
substantial evidence as credible evidence which is of
 sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of
reasonable caution to support a conclusion.
 
Bremer v. Weeks, 104 Hawai' i 43, 51, 85 P.3d 150, 158 (2004) 
(citations omitted). Appellate courts review a lower court's 
conclusions of law de novo. Bhakta v. Cnty. of Maui, 109 Hawai' i 
198, 208, 124 P.3d 943, 953 (2005) (citation omitted). However, 
"a conclusion of law that presents mixed questions of fact and 
law is reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard because the 
court's conclusions are dependent upon the facts and 
circumstances of each individual case." Kewalo Ocean Activities 
v. Ching, 124 Hawai' i 313, 317, 243 P.3d 273, 277 (App. 2010) 
(citations and brackets omitted). 
Motions for reconsideration are reviewed under the
 
abuse of discretion standard. Amfac, Inc. v. Waikiki Beachcomber
 
Inv. Co., 74 Haw. 85, 114, 839 P.2d 10, 26 (1992) (citation
 omitted). An abuse of discretion occurs if the trial court has
 
"clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or
 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a
 
party litigant." Id. at 114, 839 P.2d at 26.
 
It appears from the record of the trial in this case
 
that the challenged FOFs are supported by substantial and
 
credible evidence of sufficient quality and probative value to
 
support the Circuit Court's conclusion, including but not limited
 
to the testimony of the State's engineering expert Richard Ryan,
 
the Hawaii State Uniform Design Manual for Streets and Highways
 
1980, and applicable American Association of State Highway and
 
Transportation Officials standards. It is clear from the
 
FOFs/COLs that the Circuit Court carefully reviewed, considered,
 
and weighed, inter alia, the proffered standards, arguments, and
 
expert testimony presented by both the State and the Plaintiffs. 
On the challenged issues, however, the court found the
 
Plaintiffs' evidence and arguments to be unpersuasive or not
 
dispositive. Although, as the Circuit Court acknowledged,
 
Plaintiffs presented evidence contrary to the court's findings
 
and conclusions, we are not left with a definite and firm
 
conviction that a mistake has been committed. Further, even
 
after fully and carefully considering Plaintiff's "geometry"
 
argument, which was emphasized and clearly articulated at oral
 
argument, in reviewing the entire evidence, and in light of the
 
applicable burden of proof at trial, we cannot conclude that the
 
Circuit Court clearly erred in this case. Accordingly, we reject
 
Plaintiffs' contentions that the Circuit Court erred in its
 
FOFs/COLS and in entering judgment in favor of the State.
 
It does not appear that, in their motions for 
reconsideration, Plaintiffs presented new evidence or arguments 
not presented and not able to be presented earlier in the case. 
Thus, the Circuit Court did not err in denying reconsideration. 
See Ass'n of Apt. Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea Resort Co., 
Ltd., 100 Hawai' i 97, 110, 58 P.3d 608, 621 (2002). 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's November 20,
 
2008 Final Judgment is affirmed.
