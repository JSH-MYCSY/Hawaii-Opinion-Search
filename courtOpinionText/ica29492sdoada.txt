APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P. NO. 08-1-0350)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Employer-Appellant City and County of Honolulu (City)
 
appeals from the Circuit Court of the First Circuit's (Circuit
 
Court's) October 28, 2008 Order Granting [United Public Workers,
 AFSCME, Local 646, AFL-CIO (UPW's)] Motion to Confirm Arbitration
 
Decision and Award of Christine Kuriyama Dated 6/28/03, Filed
 
9/17/08 (Order Granting Motion to Confirm).
1
 
The City raises three points of error on appeal:
 
(1) The Circuit Court erred by granting UPW's motion
 
to confirm because HRS § 658-8 (1993) establishes a one-year
 limitation period for confirmation of an arbitration award; 
1
 The Honorable Karl K. Sakamoto presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2) The Circuit Court erred by equating a motion to
 
confirm an arbitration award with an action to enforce an
 
arbitration award; and
 
(3) The Circuit Court erred in awarding attorneys'
 
fees in favor of UPW and against the City.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve the City's appeal as follows:
 
In the first instance, UPW argues that this court lacks 
appellate jurisdiction to review the Order Granting Motion to 
Confirm because the City failed to timely file a motion to vacate 
the underlying arbitration award, citing various cases including, 
inter alia, Excelsior Lodge Number One, Independent Order of Odd 
Fellows v. Eyecor, Ltd., 74 Haw. 210, 847 P.2d 652 (1992), and 
Schmidt v. Pacific Benefit Servs., Inc., 113 Hawai' i 161, 150 
P.3d 810 (2006). These cases are, however, inapposite. In Excelsior, the supreme court "expressly h[e]ld that a party who 
seeks to change an arbitration award, but fails to follow the 
specific statutory provisions for challenging the award by timely 
bringing a motion under either §§ 658-9 or 658-10, is foreclosed 
from subsequently appealing a § 658-8 confirmation order under 
HRS § 658-15." 74 Haw. at 227, 847 P.2d at 660 (emphasis added). 
Here, the City does not seek to vacate, modify, correct, or in 
any other way challenge or change the underlying arbitration 
award. The City instead argues that UPW's motion to confirm was 
filed several years after the one-year period set forth in HRS 
§ 658-8 and, therefore, was improperly granted. We agree. 
HRS § 658-8 states, in pertinent part:
 
At any time within one year after the award is made and
served, any party to the arbitration may apply to the
circuit court specified in the agreement, or if none is
specified, to the circuit court of the judicial circuit in
which the arbitration was had, for an order confirming the
award. Thereupon the court shall grant such an order,

unless the award is vacated, modified, or corrected, as
prescribed in sections 658-9 and 658-10.
 
The Circuit Court nevertheless concluded that HRS
 
§ 658-8 did not bar UPW from filing a motion to confirm more than
 
five years after the arbitrator made and served her decision,
 
stating that:
 
Section 658-8, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) does not
preclude [UPW] from filing a motion to confirm the arbitralaward to enforce its remedial terms and conditions after one year. Krystoff v. Kalama Land Co. Ltd., 88 Hawai' i 209, 965 
P.2d 142 (App. 1998).
 
Krystoff, however, does not support the Circuit Court's
 
conclusion. The Krystoffs had filed a complaint for a
 
declaratory judgment seeking a declaration that an arbitration
 
award was unenforceable because the other party had not moved to
 
confirm it within the one-year period provided in HRS § 658-8. 
Id. at 212, 965 P.2d at 145. The circuit court concluded that
 
failure to timely confirm an arbitration award does not preclude
 
other remedies to enforce the award. Id. at 213, 965 P.2d at
 
146. On appeal, this court agreed with the circuit court, 
favorably citing various cases for the proposition that the 
statutory process allowing confirmation of an arbitration award 
is one method of enforcement of the award, but that it does not 
preclude common-law enforcement remedies. Id. at 214-16, 965 
P.2d at 147-49. This statutory method for enforcement is merely "an expeditious procedure for reducing or converting the 
arbitration award to a judgment which can be enforced by judicial 
writ." Mikelson v. United Servs. Auto. Ass'n, 122 Hawai' i 393, 
395, 227 P.3d 559, 561 (App. 2010) (internal quotation marks and 
citation omitted).  Krystoff does not support the proposition 
that the one-year period provided in HRS § 658-8 is superfluous. 
HRS § 658-8 allows parties to an arbitration one year
 
to petition for confirmation of an award. In this case, the
 Circuit Court erred when it entered the Order Granting Motion to 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Confirm based on a motion filed more than one year after the
 
arbitrator's award. 
With respect to the City's second point of error, as
 
stated above, a statutory motion to confirm an arbitration award
 
is a non-exclusive method of enforcement of an award. 
Finally, the Circuit Court erred in awarding attorney's
 
fees and costs to UPW. We reject UPW's argument, and the Circuit
 
Court's conclusion, that City's "groundless" opposition to the
 
motion to confirm constituted a failure to "abide by a 'final and
 
binding' award as required by Section 15.20b of the agreement of
 
the parties without justification" and thus justified the award
 
of fees. UPW does not argue, nor does the record show, that the
 
City was in non-compliance with the arbitrator's decision.
 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's October 28, 2008
 
Order Granting Motion to Confirm is reversed.
