NO. 29501
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT AGENCY, STATE OF HAWAI' I,
Plaintiff-Appellee, v. SH, Defendant-Appellant,
and SW, Defendant 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-P NO. 06-1-0276)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant SH (SH) appeals pro se from the
 
October 7, 2008 Judgment of Paternity regarding her child
 
(Child), entered by the Family Court of the First Circuit (family
 
court).1
 
On appeal, SH does not raise any articulable legal 
issues. As best we can ascertain, her sole contention appears to 
be that the family court erred in entertaining the Complaint for 
Establishment of Paternity filed by the Child Support Enforcement 
Agency, State of Hawai' i. In particular, SH contests the family 
court's order that Child's father's name be placed on Child's birth certificate because SH signed and delivered to her social 
worker at the Department of Human Services (DHS) a "'Good Clause' 
contract" attesting to her belief that Child's father presented a 
danger to SH and Child should DHS pursue him for support for 
Child. 
1 The Honorable Patricia C. Aburano presided.

However, SH has not provided transcripts and does not 
provide any legal basis from which we could conclude the family 
court erred in entering the Judgment of Paternity. Although the 
appellate courts of this state have adhered to the policy of 
affording litigants the opportunity to have their cases heard on 
the merits where possible, Schefke v. Reliable Collection Agency, 
Ltd., 96 Hawai' i 408, 420, 32 P.3d 52, 64 (2001), as SH has not 
provided us with a complete record or a discernible legal argument upon which to grant relief, we must decline to do so 
here. 
Therefore, we affirm the October 7, 2008 Judgment of 
Paternity entered by the Family Court of the First Circuit.
