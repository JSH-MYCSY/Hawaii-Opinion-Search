Circuit Judge Perkins, in place of

Petitioner-Appellant Anthony K. Chatman (Chatman)
appeals from the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order
Denying Petition For Post-Conviction Relief (FOF/COL/Order) filed
on January 26, 2009 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
(circuit court).1
On June 30, 2003, a jury convicted Chatman of (1)
Attempted Murder in the Second Degree, in violation of Hawaii
Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 705-500(2) (1993), 707-701.5 (1993),
and 706-656 (1993 & Supp. 2009) in Cr. No. 02-1-0011; and 
(2) Bribery of a Witness, in violation of HRS § 710-1070(1)(a),
(b), and (c) (1993); Intimidating a Witness, in violation of HRS
§ 710-1071(1)(a), (b), and (c) (1993); and Extortion in the
Second Degree, in violation of HRS §§ 707-766(1)(b) (1993) and
707-764(2) (Supp. 2007) in Cr. No. 02-1-2353.2  The circuit courtNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
  On December 30, 2002, the circuit court consolidated Cr. Nos. 02-1-3
0011 and 02-1-2353 for trial.
2filed its judgments on July 19, 2004,3 and Chatman timely
appealed.
On August 3, 2006, in Chatman's direct appeal, the
Hawai#i Supreme Court (1) affirmed his convictions except for his
conviction in Cr. No. 02-1-2353 for Extortion in the Second
Degree, which the court vacated, and (2) denied his ineffective
assistance of counsel claim without prejudice.
On May 12, 2008, Chatman filed a Petition for Post-
Conviction Relief (Petition), pursuant to Rule 40 of the Hawaii
Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP).  Chatman claimed that he had
received ineffective assistance of counsel because his trial
counsel failed to (1) secure the presence or testimony of a
witness, Eri Gunji (Gunji), at trial (2) investigate a juror, and
(3) secure the appearance of witnesses for a motion for new
trial.
The State of Hawai# i filed its answer on September 5,
2008.  On January 26, 2009, the circuit court filed the
FOF/COL/Order.  Chatman timely appealed.
On appeal, Chatman asserts the same claims as those in
his Petition.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude that
Chatman's points of error are without merit.  Chatman did not
meet his "burden of establishing ineffective assistance of
counsel . . . :  1) that there were specific errors or omissions
reflecting counsel's lack of skill, judgment, or diligence; and
2) that such errors or omissions resulted in either the
withdrawal or substantial impairment of a potentially meritorious
defense."  State v. Wakisaka, 102 Hawai #i 504, 514, 78 P.3d 317,NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

omitted).
Therefore,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Findings of Fact,
Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying Petition For Post-
Conviction Relief filed on January 26, 2009 in the Circuit Court
of the First Circuit is affirmed.
