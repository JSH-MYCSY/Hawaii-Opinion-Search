Kealoha, Acting Major, HPD Internal Affairs, Nyle Dolera, and HPD
 
Department of Internal Affairs, and against Among, filed on
 
November 12, 2008, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 
raises five points of error on appeal, arguing
 
that the Circuit Court erred by:
 
(1) Denying his Motion For Summary Judgment and Motion
 
For Reconsideration because, as a matter of law, the police
 
lacked probable cause to arrest him;
 
(2) Declining to apply State v. Keawe, 107 Hawai' i 1, 
108 P.3d 304 (2005); 
(3) Denying the admission of Among's Exhibits 16, 17,
 
at 18;
 
(4) Declining to adopt Among's Proposed Jury
 
Instructions and Proposed Special Verdict Forms; and
 
(5) Denying Among's motion in limine to exclude a
 
report of an alleged knife incident between Among and Schwenker.3
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
conclude that Among's contentions have no merit.
