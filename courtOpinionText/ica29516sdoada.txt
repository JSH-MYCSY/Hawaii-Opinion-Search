  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
December 1, 2008 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit1
 
(circuit court). The circuit court denied the Locricchios' post-
judgment motion asking the court, pursuant to HRCP Rule 11, to
 
sanction attorneys Jonathan L. Ortiz and Gaylord Tom, the
 
attorneys representing Petitioner-Appellee Estrella C.S. Igarta. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude that 
Locricchios' appeal is without merit. The circuit court did not 
abuse its discretion in denying the Locricchios' motion for 
sanctions. Enos v. Pac. Transfer & Warehouse, Inc. , 79 Hawai» i 
452, 903 P.2d 1273 (1995). 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Order Denying
 
Respondents' Motion for Award of Rule 11 Sanctions Filed
 
08/07/08" filed December 1, 2008 in the Circuit Court of the
 
First Circuit is affirmed.
