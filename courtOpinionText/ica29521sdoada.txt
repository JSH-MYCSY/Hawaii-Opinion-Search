(CIVIL CASE NO. 1RC07-1-3836)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendants-Appellants Daniel K. Ching and Patricia
 
Ching, individually and doing business as (dba) Hawaii's
 
Favorite, Inc. ("the Chings"), appeal pro se from the Judgment
 
entered on November 17, 2008 in the District Court of the First
 
Circuit, Honolulu Division (District Court)1
 in favor of
Plaintiff-Appellee MHI LLC, dba SCU Holdings ("MHI"), as to its
 complaint for summary possession and breach-of-lease money
 
damages.
 
Under a section heading entitled, "Statement of the
 
Point of Error," the Chings contend that the District Court erred
 
by denying the Chings' motion to dismiss the complaint because
 
the District Court denied the Chings an opportunity to speak to

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
questions that the District Court identified. In the argument
 
section, the Chings contend that the District Dourt erred by (1)
 
accepting the representations of MHI's counsel that her failure
 
to appear in court on two separate occasions was due to
 
calendaring errors; (2) failing to dismiss the case after
 
August 29, 2007, when certain accounting issues between the
 
Chings and MHI were resolved; and (3) denying their motion to
 
dismiss for failure to join an indispensable party.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, as well as the
 
relevant statutory and case law, we resolve the Chings' points of
 
error as follows:
 
(1) The Chings' arguments, to the extent that they
 
intend to challenge the amended judgment for possession and the
 
amended writ of possession, are moot because the writ of
 
possession already has been executed and, accepting arguendo that
 
the Chings' original lease had not been previously extinguished,
 
the Chings admitted that the original lease expired in July 2008. 
See Exit Co. Ltd. P'ship v. Airlines Capital Corp., 7 Haw. App.
 
363, 366, 766 P.2d 129, 131 (1988) (holding that an appeal from a
 
summary judgment of possession and cancellation of a lease
 
between private businesses was moot because the writ of
 
possession had been executed and the lease had expired).
 
(2) As to the Chings' asserted point of error regarding
 
the opportunity to be heard, the record reflects that they were
 
given ample opportunity to speak to questions identified by the
 
District Court. The District Court held hearings on all of the
 
substantive motions, allowing both parties to ask and answer
 
questions. The District Court also conducted a two-day trial on
 
the damages issue.
 
(3) To the Chings' first specific argument that the
 
District Court erred by accepting the representations of MHI's
 
counsel that her failure to appear in court on two separate
 
occasions was due to calendaring errors, the Chings rely on a
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
series of inferences that do not constitute an airtight chain of 
logic. It is perfectly plausible that MHI's counsel prepared for 
the January 7, 2008 hearing but still forgot to calendar the 
hearing. This is the kind of credibility determination that is 
given to the district court. See generally Kerr v. Silva, 129 
Hawaifi 268, 297 P.3d 1124, CAAP–11–0000958 2013 WL 1091735 at *2 
(App. Mar. 15, 2013) (SDO). 
Also, the Chings' assertion that they were prejudiced
 
by the failure of MHI's counsel to attend the January 7, 2008
 
hearing is not supported by the record. The January 7, 2008
 
hearing was on the Chings' motion to set aside the original
 
(default) judgment against them, and, in any event, the District
 
Court granted the Chings' motion. Furthermore, the effect of the
 
absence did not obviously extend any further because, as noted
 
above, the District Court held hearings on the substantive
 
motions and conducted a trial on the damages issue.
 
(4) As to their argument regarding the District Court's
 
failure to dismiss the case after the accounting dispute between
 
MHI and the Chings was resolved, the Chings provide no reasoning
 
or authorities that explains the materiality of the accounting
 
dispute or even its relationship to the complaint. The complaint
 
alleged that the landlord terminated a month-to-month lease and
 
nothing in the record establishes that the lease could only be
 
terminated for non-payment of rent. Accordingly, the Chings'
 
assertion that the case should not have been filed or should have
 
been dismissed when the accounting issue was resolved appears to
 
be a non sequitur.
 
(5) The Chings' third argument does not go to any of
 
the factors that comprise the test for whether a party is
 
indispensable, see Thornley v. Sanchez, 9 Haw. App. 606, 613, 857
 
P.2d 601, 605 (1993). Instead, the Chings contend that they do
 
not owe anything to MHI because their personal liability was
 
based on personal guaranties that were part of a written lease
 
that MHI had disavowed. In that this argument effectively goes
 
to the damages issue that was disposed of in the judgment entered

on November 17, 2008, it survives. However, an examination of
 
cases from other jurisdictions demonstrates that whether a
 
personal guaranty continues depends on the specific contractual
 
language and other facts of the case. Compare Roth v. Dillavou,
 
359 Ill. App. 3d 1023, 1031, 835 N.E.2d 425, 432, 296 Ill. Dec.
 391, 398 (Ill. App. Ct. 2005) (holding that, once a guarantor is
 
on notice that a month-to-month tenancy may result if the tenant
 
holds over and the landlord consents to the arrangement, the
 
guaranty continues to apply); G.H. Bass & Co. v. Dalsan
 
Props.—Abilene, 885 S.W.2d 572, 577 (Tex. App. 1994) (holding the
 
surety liable for rent during a holdover period under a
 
commercial lease where the lease contemplated a holdover and the
 
surety was liable for rent and all other charges payable by the
 
lessor under the lease) with Home Owners' Loan Corp. v. Strongs'
 
Inc., 69 S.D. 81, 83, 6 N.W.2d 446, 447 (S.D. 1942) (holding that
 
guarantor was not liable where the guaranty did not state that
 
the guarantor would pay rent under any agreement separate from
 
the lease); Trolley Square Assocs. v. Nielson, 886 P.2d 61, 68
 
(Utah Ct. App. 1994) (holding that guarantee applied only to
 
obligations incurred during the term of the lease); VLC One, LLC
 
v. Davis, 148 Wash. App. 1037, No. 61945-4-I 2009 WL 297005 at *3 
(Wash. Ct. App. Feb. 9, 2009). Here, the Chings do not discuss 
the specific terms of the lease nor do they present any 
authorities for the proposition that, as a matter of Hawaif i law, 
their personal guaranties did not continue after the expiration of the original lease. In the absence of such briefing, the 
Chings have not complied with Rule 28(b)(7) of the Hawaif i Rules 
of Appellate Procedure. Furthermore, the record does not appear to contain a full copy of the original lease or the personal 
guaranties. Without these documents, this court has no basis 
upon which it could make a determination about the continuing 
vitality of the guaranties. When an appellant fails to provide 
the necessary record, the lower court must be

affirmed. See Union Bldg. Materials Corp. v. Kakaako Corp., 5
 
Haw. App. 146, 151-52, 682 P.2d 82, 87 (1984). 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment entered on
 
November 17, 2008 in the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division is affirmed.
