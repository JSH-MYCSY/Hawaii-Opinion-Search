NO. 29535
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee v.
ROBERT N. TOMINIKO, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(HPD Traffic No. 1DTA-08-08506)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Ginoza, J., with
Nakamura, C.J., concurring separately,
and Fujise, J., dissenting separately)
 
Defendant-Appellant Robert N. Tominiko (Tominiko)
 
appeals from a judgment entered on December 1, 2008 in the
 
District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (district
 court).
1 Tominiko was convicted of Operating a Vehicle Under the
 
Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII) in violation of Hawaii Revised
 Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1) and § 291E-61(a)(3) (Supp. 2008).
 
On appeal, Tominiko raises two points of error:
 (1) The prosecution's written and oral charges for
 
OVUII were fatally insufficient because they failed to allege the
 essential element that Tominiko operated or assumed actual
 physical control of a vehicle "upon a public way, street, road,
 or highway."
 
(2) The district court erred when it denied a motion to
 
suppress, because under the totality of the circumstances the
 stop of Tominiko was not justified by specific and articulable
 facts that Tominiko was engaged in criminal activity.
 I. Sufficiency of the Charge
 
In State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai
'i 383, 219 P.3d 1170 
(2009), the Hawai 'i Supreme Court recently held that under the 
circumstances there, the State's failure to allege that Wheeler 
1
 The Honorable William Cardwell presided.
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
operated or assumed actual physical control of his vehicle "upon
 
a public way, street, road, or highway" rendered the charge
 insufficient. There, the defendant immediately objected to the
 sufficiency of the charge before the trial court. In the instant
 case, Tominiko did not object to the charge at any point in the
 district court proceedings and instead raises the issue for the
 first time on appeal.
 
A. Due Process Concerns and the Question of Jurisdiction
 As a threshold matter, under existing Hawai
'i case law, 
insufficiency of a charge is addressed primarily as a due process concern that implicates whether proper notice was given to the defendant. However, some cases further address it as a matter of basic jurisdiction. 
This is significant because under the cases addressing
 
the matter primarily as a due process concern (i.e., the
 accused's right to be informed of the nature and cause of the
 
2
 an inquiry beyond the specific language of the accusation),charge may be appropriate, especially where the sufficiency of the charge is raised for the first time on appeal. 
See State v.

(2006) ("An insufficient indictment can be cured."); State v. Sprattling, 99 Hawai
'i 312, 318, 55 P.3d 276, 282 (2002) ("[I]n

Hawai'i 66, 70, 890 P.2d 303, 307 (1995) ("In analyzing whether a 
defendant's article I, section 14 right to be informed has been 
violated, however, we are not confined to an examination of the charge. On the contrary . . . 'we must look to all of the information supplied to him [or her] by the State to the point where the court passes upon the contention that the right has been violated.'") (quoting State v. Treat, 67 Haw. 119, 120, 680 P.2d 250, 251 (1984)); State v. Elliott, 77 Hawai
'i 309, 312, 884 
P.2d 372, 375 (1994)(applying liberal construction standard and noting that "[o]ne way in which an otherwise deficient count can be reasonably construed to charge a crime is by examination of the charge as a whole."); State v. Motta, 66 Haw. 89, 91, 657 P.2d 1019, 1020 (1983) (under the liberal construction standard adopted for post-conviction challenges to indictments, conviction on a defective indictment will not be reversed "unless the defendant can show prejudice or that the indictment cannot within reason be construed to charge a crime"). 
To the contrary, in State v. Cummings, 101 Hawai
'i 139, 
63 P.3d 1109 (2003), sufficiency of the charge was addressed as a matter of substantive jurisdiction and the Hawai
'i Supreme Court 
held that no further inquiry or analysis was relevant beyond the charge itself because a defective charge cannot be waived, nor can it be deemed harmless. In Cummings, where the indictment was timely challenged before the trial court, the court ruled that "reversal of a conviction obtained on such a defective accusation does not require a showing of prejudice." 101 Hawai
'i at 143, 63 
P.3d at 1113. The court concluded that: 
This is because a defect in a complaint is not one of mere
form, which is waivable, nor simply one of notice, which may
be deemed harmless if a defendant was actually aware of the
nature of the accusation against him or her, but, rather, is
one of substantive subject matter jurisdiction, "which may
not be waived or dispensed with," see Jendrusch, 58 Haw. at
281, 567 P.2d at 1244, and that is per se prejudicial, see
 Motta, 66 Haw. at 91, 657 P.2d at 1020 (quoting United
 States v. Thompson, 356 F.2d 216, 226 (2nd Cir. 1965)).

Id.3 See also, Territory v. Goto, 27 Haw. 65, 102-103, 1923 WL
 
2749 (Haw. Terr. 1923) (Peters, C.J., concurring)("Failure of an
 
indictment to state facts sufficient to constitute an offense
 against the law is jurisdictional and is available to the
 defendant at any time.").
 
Notwithstanding the Cummings decision that a defective
 
charge undermines jurisdiction, the court in Cummings did not
 overrule Motta and its progeny. Further, most recently, Wheeler
 reconfirmed the view that the Motta/Wells post-conviction liberal
 standard applies when an objection to a defective charge is not
 timely raised in the trial court. The Wheeler court stated:
 
[T]his court has applied different principles depending on
whether or not an objection was timely raised in the trial
court. Under the "Motta/Wells post-conviction liberal
construction rule," we liberally construe charges challenged
for the first time on appeal. . . . Under this approach,
there is a "presumption of validity," . . . for charges
challenged subsequent to a conviction. In those
 circumstances, this court will "not reverse a conviction
based upon a defective indictment [or complaint] unless the
defendant can show prejudice or that the indictment [or
complaint] cannot within reason be construed to charge a
crime." . . . . However, the rule does not apply when
reviewing timely motions challenging the sufficiency of an
indictment.
 
121 Hawai 'i at 399-400, 219 P.3d at 1186-87 (citations omitted 
and emphasis added).
 
Thus, where a defective charge is challenged for the
 
first time on appeal, the charge is presumed valid and the
 
Motta/Wells liberal construction standard is applied.
 
3 For this ruling, the Cummings court relied on State v. Jendrusch, 58
 
Haw. 279, 567 P.2d 1242 (1977) and State v. Motta, 66 Haw. 89, 657 P.2d 1019
(1983). While Jendrusch states that an insufficient charge "would constitute
a denial of due process," which "may not be waived or dispensed with," and
"the defect is ground for reversal, even when raised for the first time on
appeal," 58 Haw. at 281, 567 P.2d at 1244, Motta, which was decided after
Jendrusch, adopted the rule of liberally construing indictments challenged for
the first time on appeal. The Motta court explained that its decision was not
incompatible with Jendrusch because, "[u]sing the language of these liberal
construction cases we would still find that the charge in Jendrusch was 'so
obviously defective that by no reasonable construction can it be said to
charge the offense for which conviction was had.'" Motta, 66 Haw. at 92, 657
 
P.2d at 1021 (citation omitted).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
B.	 Application of the Motta/Wells Liberal Construction
Standard
 
Under the Motta/Wells liberal construction standard,
 
the validity of the charge is presumed and the conviction will
 
not be reversed unless the defendant can show: (a) prejudice; or
 (b) that the charge cannot within reason be construed to charge a
 crime.
 
Tominiko does not assert that he has been prejudiced by 
the defective charge. Rather, he contends that he need not show prejudice, even where the liberal construction standard is applied, because a defective charge is always fatal and the district court lacked jurisdiction to preside over the case. As set forth above, a conviction is not automatically reversed on jurisdictional grounds where the defendant failed to timely challenge a defective charge. Instead, the Motta/Wells liberal construction standard applies, under which prejudice to the defendant is a factor. See Wheeler, 121 Hawai
'i at 400, 219 P.3d 
at 1187. Tominiko has thus failed to make any showing of prejudice.
4 
Tominiko also fails to present any argument that the 
Complaint or oral charge cannot reasonably be construed to charge a crime. In deciding this issue, it is proper to "consider other information in addition to the charge that may have been provided to the defendant during the course of the case up until the time defendant objected to the sufficiency of the charges against him." Wheeler, 121 Hawai
'i at 396, 219 P.3d at 1183. See also 
Elliott, 77 Hawai 'i at 312, 884 P.2d at 375 (court examined the 
charge as a whole); State v. Schroeder, 76 Hawai 'i 517, 530, 880 
P.2d 192, 205 (1994) (information from one count was reasonably construed as providing sufficient information for another count, with court noting both counts alleged offenses committed on same 
4
 In addition, while not necessarily dispositive on the question of
prejudice, the record reflects that upon being given the oral charge, Tominiko
was asked if he understood the charge and he affirmatively responded "yes."
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
date); Treat, 67 Haw. 119, 680 P.2d 250 (grand jury transcripts
 
informed defendant of the nature and cause of the accusation
 against him). Considering the information provided to Tominiko
 in the entirety of the written Complaint, as well as information
 in the facts stipulated for trial, the Complaint and oral charge
 can reasonably be construed to charge a crime.
 
In the three page Complaint, the first paragraph 
charges that on August 2, 2008, Tominiko committed the offense of OVUII but does not allege that he was driving a vehicle upon a public way, street, road, or highway. However, the third paragraph of the Complaint, alleging a charge for Driving Without Motor Vehicle Insurance on the same date as the OVUII charge (August 2, 2008), does allege that Tominiko "did operate or use a motor vehicle upon a public street, road, or highway of the State of Hawai
'i." Because each of these paragraphs state that the 
nd
events occurred "[o]n or about the 2  day of August, 2008, inthe City and County of Honolulu, State of Hawai
'i," it is 
reasonable to construe that they arise from the same event. See 
Schroeder; Elliott. 
Additionally, for the trial, Tominiko stipulated into
 
evidence the facts in the police report. The police report
 states the "PLACE OF OFFENSE" for the OVUII charge as "AHONUI
 ST/N. SCHOOL ST HONOLULU, HI 96819." The police report also
 states that the vehicle operated by Tominiko was "parked on the
 right side of Ahonui St. about 20 feet from N. School St.", and
 that while being asked for his identification Tominiko got in his
 car, started to drive off slowly, but "had to stop, due to
 another vehicle traveling in the opposite direction which had to
 stop in front of his car due to traffic congestion." From the
 stipulated facts in the police report, it can be reasonably
 construed that the OVUII offense occurred on a public street or
 road.
 
Based on the above, Tominiko has not shown prejudice
 
arising from the defective charge, and the Complaint and oral 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
7charge can reasonably be construed to charge a crime.  Therefore,
under the Motta/Wells  liberal construction standard, Tominiko's
conviction will not be reversed due to the insufficiency of the
OVUII charge.
II. Motion to Suppress
Tominiko also contends that the district court erred in
denying his motion to suppress evidence, which was grounded on
the argument that the responding police officer did not have
reasonable suspicion to stop and detain Tominiko.
A. Standard of Review
On appeal, a de novo  standard of review applies to a
trial court's ruling on a motion to suppress evidence.
A [circuit] court's ruling on a motion to suppress evidence
is reviewed de novo to determine whether the ruling was
"right" or "wrong." State v. Edwards, 96 Hawai» i 224, 231,
30 P.3d 238, 245 (2001) (citing State v. Jenkins, 93 Hawai» i
87, 100, 997 P.2d 13, 26 (2000)). The proponent of the
motion to suppress has the burden of establishing, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that the statements or items
sought to be excluded were unlawfully secured and that his
or her right to be free from unreasonable searches or
seizures was violated under the fourth amendment to the
United States Constitution and article I, section 7 of the
Hawai»i Constitution. See State v. Wilson, 92 Hawai» i 45, 48,
987 P.2d 268, 271 (1999) (citations omitted).
State v. Estabillio , 121 Hawai i 261, 269, 218 P.3d 749, 757
(2009) (quoting State v. Kaleohano, 99 Hawai i 370, 375, 56 P.3d
138, 143 (2002)).»
»
Evidence at both the suppression hearing and the trial
are considered.  State v. Sanford, 97 Hawai i 247, 251 n.8, 35
P.3d 764, 768 n.8 (App. 2001); State v. Nakachi , 7 Haw. App. 28,
33 n.7, 742 P.2d 388, 392 n.7 (1987); State v. Uddipa, 3 Haw.
App. 415, 416-17, 651 P.2d 507, 509 (1982).  Further, because the
State prevailed below on the motion to suppress, any factual
disputes are reviewed in a light favorable to the prosecution. 
In Nakachi, this Court stated: »
When reviewing this issue, we consider all the evidence
received at the motion to suppress hearing and at the trial.

motion to suppress. See 3 Wright, Federal Practice and
Procedure: Criminal 2d § 678 (1982).

B. District Court Proceedings
 
The only witness at the suppression hearing was Officer
 
Antwan Stuart. Officer Stuart testified that on August 2, 2008,
 around midnight, he was sent via Honolulu Police Department
 dispatch to the intersection of Ahonui and School Streets in
 response to "a call of about 15 people arguing." When he
 arrived, he testified that he saw about 15 to 20 people standing
 around eating and drinking, including drinking beer. Officer
 Stuart testified that he saw "some green bottle Heinekens." 
According to the police report, which was stipulated into
 evidence at the trial, the group was standing around an Isuzu
 Trooper. Upon Officer Stuart's arrival the group started
 grabbing things and leaving immediately.
 
When he first arrived, Officer Stuart was across the
 
street about 20 feet from the group and could hear people talking
 loudly but could not determine if there was an argument. When he
 approached the group, Officer Stuart testified he did not recall
 seeing Tominiko holding anything and did not recollect him
 talking loudly.
 
Tominiko started walking towards the Isuzu Trooper and,
 
because Tominiko was the only person that didn't leave in a
 hurry, Officer Stuart asked for his identification "to
 investigate what was going on over there, if indeed there was
 a[n] argument or if there was a fight" and also because Officer
 Stuart testified "I've known that that area is –- a lot of people
 like to drink over there." In response to Officer Stuart's
 request for his identification, Tominiko "mumbled something but
 then kept walking and got into the car".
 
Officer Stuart followed Tominiko to the Isuzu Trooper
 
and asked him to get out of the vehicle. Instead, Tominiko
 started the vehicle and started to drive slowly off, at which 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
point Officer Stuart "yelled" at Tominiko to turn off the vehicle
 
and to show his identification. After driving "about another
 seven feet or so," Tominiko was forced to stop because he didn't
 have enough room to get by another vehicle that was traveling in
 the opposite direction.
 
After Tominiko's vehicle came to its final resting
 
spot, Officer Stuart approached from the rear driver's side and
 noticed empty beer bottles in the back seat. Tominiko was
 subsequently arrested and charged with, inter alia, OVUII. At
 the suppression hearing, the district court ruled that Officer
 Stuart had reasonable suspicion to stop Tominiko, and further
 that "once defendant refused to comply with [Officer Stuart's]
 simple request for identification, the officer had the further
 right to pursue the defendant and stop him."
 
C.	 There Was an Investigative Stop Based On Reasonable
Suspicion 
Tominiko argues that the district court erred in
 
denying his suppression motion because: (a) Officer Stuart's
 
conduct amounted to a seizure of Tominiko; and (b) the seizure
 was not justified.
 
"[A] person is 'seized' in the constitutional sense if, 
from an objective standpoint and given the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable person would have believed that he or she was not free to leave." State v. Trainor, 83 Hawai
'i 250, 
256, 925 P.2d 818, 824 (1996); State v. Tsukiyama, 56 Haw. 8, 525 P.2d 1099 (1974). "[A] person is seized, for purposes of article I, section 7 of the Hawai
'i Constitution, when a police officer 
approaches that person for the express or implied purpose of investigating him or her for possible criminal violations and begins to ask for information." State v. Kearns, 75 Haw. 558, 
567, 867 P.2d 903, 907 (1994). 
For investigatory stops, Hawaii has adopted the
 
principles set forth in Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968). That
 is, the police may "temporarily detain an individual if they have 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
a reasonable suspicion based on specific and articulable facts
 
that criminal activity is afoot." Kearns, 75 Haw. at 569, 867
 
P.2d at 908 (1994).
 
To justify an investigative stop, short of an arrest based
on probable cause, "the police officer must be able to point
to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with
rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant
that intrusion." Terry v. Ohio, supra, at 21. The ultimate
 
test in these situations must be whether from these facts,
measured by an objective standard, a man of reasonable
caution would be warranted in believing that criminal
activity was afoot and that the action taken was
appropriate.
 
State v. Barnes, 58 Haw. 333, 338, 568 P.2d 1207, 1211 (1977). 
See also State v. Madamba, 62 Haw. 453, 456, 617 P.2d 76, 78 (1980); State v. Powell, 61 Haw. 316, 321-22, 603 P.2d 143, 147­48 (1979). In deciding whether there is reasonable suspicion for an investigatory stop, the totality of the circumstances is considered. State v. Spillner, 116 Hawai
'i 351, 357, 173 P.3d 
498, 504 (2007). 
Tominiko contends that he was improperly seized,
 
particularly after he was pursued by Officer Stuart. Given the
 totality of the circumstances, a seizure clearly occurred when
 Officer Stuart followed Tominiko to his vehicle, asked him to get
 out and, as Tominiko started to drive away, Officer Stuart yelled
 at Tominiko to stop. Unlike in Tsukiyama, where an officer's
 request for identification was not deemed a seizure because the
 officer "did not order the defendant to get it or demand that he
 get it," 56 Haw. at 12, 525 P.2d at 1102 (emphasis in original),
 Officer Stuart's conduct here was an order or demand and, in the
 totality of the circumstances, a reasonable person would not
 believe he was free to leave. Although Tominiko did in fact
 continue his attempt to leave, an objective test is applied.
 
Notwithstanding that a seizure did occur, Officer
 
Stuart had reasonable suspicion sufficient to support an
 investigatory stop. Although Tominiko contends the anonymous
 call of about 15 people arguing "lacked sufficient indicia of
 reliability to provide a reasonable and articulable suspicion,"
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
there was additional information observed by Officer Stuart at
 
the scene, consistent with the complaint of about 15 people
 arguing, and which provided even further basis for reasonable
 suspicion that criminal activity was afoot. The record does not
 support Tominiko's assertion that, "[w]hen Officer Stuart reached
 the scene, there was simply nothing to suggest a crime had been
 committed and that Mr. Tominiko was the perpetrator." To the
 contrary, there had been the call to police of about 15 people
 arguing at that location; Tominiko was among the group of
 individuals at that location; it was midnight; the group was
 standing around the Isuzu Trooper that Tominiko would attempt to
 drive away; the vehicle and the group were located by the
 intersection of two public streets; some members of the group
 were observed talking loudly and drinking beer; and this was an
 area where Officer Stuart knew people liked to drink.
 
Based on the totality of the circumstances at this
 
point, there are specific and articulable facts to support
 reasonable suspicion of criminal activity afoot, including
 disorderly conduct and possession of unsealed containers of
 intoxicating liquor on a public street.
5 Although Officer Stuart
 
5 HRS § 711-1101 provides, in part:
 
(1) A person commits the offense of disorderly conduct if, with
intent to cause physical inconvenience or alarm by a member or
members of the public, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, the
person:
 
(a) Engages in fighting or threatening, or in violent or
tumultuous behavior; or 
(b) Makes unreasonable noise; or 
. . . 
(2) Noise is unreasonable, within the meaning of subsection
(1)(b), if considering the nature and purpose of the person's
conduct and the circumstances known to the person, including the
nature of the location and the time of the day or night, the
person's conduct involves a gross deviation from the standard of
conduct that a law-abiding citizen would follow in the same
situation; . . . 
HRS § 711-1101 (Supp. 2009).
 
(continued...)
 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
did not recall seeing Tominiko with anything in his hands (i.e. 
beer) or see him argue, such facts would approach or rise to the level of probable cause for an arrest, which is a higher standard than reasonable suspicion. In addressing reasonable suspicion for an investigatory stop, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court has 
favorably quoted language from the United States Supreme Court that "the likelihood of criminal activity need not rise to the level of probable cause, and it falls considerably short of satisfying a preponderance of the evidence standard." State v. 
Spillner, 116 Hawai
'i 351, 358, 173 P.3d 498, 505 (2007) (quoting 
United States v. Arvizu, 534 U.S. 266, 273-74 (2002)). Moreover, "[a] determination that reasonable suspicion exists ... need not rule out the possibility of innocent conduct." Spillner, 116 
Hawai
'i at 358, 173 P.3d at 505 (quoting Arvizu, 534 U.S. at 
277). 
Additionally, combined with the facts set forth above 
and under the circumstances of this case, Tominiko's effort to leave the scene was an added factor supporting reasonable suspicion. In addressing the higher standard of probable cause, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court has noted: "although not dispositive, 
flight from the police is a factor which may support a finding of probable cause." State v. Melear, 63 Haw. 488, 494, 630 P.2d 
619, 625 (1981) (citing Sibron v. New York, 392 U.S. 40, 66-67 (1968); United States v. Minor, 382 F. Supp. 203, n.1 (D. Haw. 1974); Franklin v. United States, 382 A.2d 20 (D.C. App. 1978)). Similarly, for investigatory stops, other courts have held that flight alone does not create reasonable suspicion, but it could be a factor when combined with other circumstances. See State v. 
5(...continued)
Revised Ordinances of Honolulu, § 40-1.2(a) provides in pertinent part
that "[n]o person shall possess, other than in a container in the
manufacturer's sealed condition, intoxicating liquor on any street or
sidewalk".

Pineiro, 853 A.2d 887, 895 (N.J. 2004); State v. Wright, 752 A.2d 
1147 (Conn. App. 2000). Tominiko's efforts to enter his vehicle
 and drive away added to the already existing circumstances in
 this case.
6
 
To clarify, simply refusing a police officer's request
 
for identification is not enough, in and of itself, to justify an
 investigatory stop. To the extent the district court's ruling
 suggested as such, it would be incorrect. However, where as in
 this case there are other factors that also support reasonable
 suspicion, flight can be considered in the totality of the
 circumstances.
 
Finally, even if there was an improper seizure at the
 
point Officer Stuart asked Tominiko to exit or to stop his car,
 there were no fruits from such seizure. Rather, Tominiko
 continued on for another seven feet until he was forced to stop
 by another vehicle driving in the opposite direction. At that
 point, Officer Stuart caught up with Tominiko's vehicle and while
 approaching the rear driver's side observed the empty beer
 bottles on the back seat. It was the other vehicle which
 prevented Tominiko from leaving, not the demands of Officer
 Stuart, and it was from that point that the empty beer bottles
 were observed and later that Officer Stuart and another
 responding officer smelled alcohol on Tominiko's breath.
 
6 Tominiko relies on State v. Heapy, 113 Hawai' i 283, 151 P.3d 764
(2007) in arguing that his efforts to avoid Officer Stuart could not be a
basis for the investigatory stop. In Heapy, a vehicle stop was deemedimproper because the only basis for suspicion was the defendant's attempt toavoid a sobriety checkpoint. Here, as noted above, there are multipleadditional factors other than just Tominiko trying to avoid Officer Stuart andthus Heapy is distinguishable.
