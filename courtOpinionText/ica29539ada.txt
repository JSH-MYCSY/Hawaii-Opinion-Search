NAKAMURA, C.J., LEONARD, and GINOZA, JJ.
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY GINOZA, J.
 
This is the second appeal in this action, which arises
 
from a motor vehicle collision. 
After remand from the first
 
appeal, Defendant-Appellee First Insurance Company of Hawaii,
 
Ltd. (First Insurance) paid assigned claim benefits to Plaintiff-
Appellant Shilo Willis (Willis) under Hawaii's Joint Underwriting
 
Plan (JUP). The Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit

court) then granted First Insurance's motion for summary
judgment on all remaining claims alleged by Willis against First
 
Insurance, including without limitation claims for breach of
 
contract, misrepresentation, negligent or intentional infliction
 
of emotional distress, unfair claims practices, unfair or
 
deceptive acts or practices, and bad faith.
 
Willis appeals from the circuit court's Final Judgment 
filed on December 11, 2008 which entered judgment in favor of 
First Insurance and against Willis with respect to all claims not 
specifically addressed in the Hawai
'i Supreme Court's opinion in 
the first appeal, Willis v. Swain, 112 Hawai' i 184, 145 P.3d 727 
(2006) (Willis I). 
Willis asserts the following points of error in this 
appeal: (1) the circuit court erred in granting First Insurance's 
motion for summary judgment and dismissing the bad faith and 
emotional distress claims; (2) the circuit court erred in denying 
Willis's motion to compel discovery as moot because discovery was 
critical in determining Willis's claims against First Insurance, 
including the bad faith and emotional distress claims; (3) the 
circuit court erred in determining that the prior appeal resolved 
an open question of law and that Enoka v. AIG Hawaii Insurance 
Co., 109 Hawai' i 537, 128 P.3d 850 (2006) "forgives" the error 
made by First Insurance when it previously denied Willis the JUP assigned claim benefits; (4) the circuit court erred in 
concluding that there is no cognizable claim for bad faith in the 
absence of a contract; and (5) genuine issues of material fact 
precluded the granting of First Insurance's motion for summary 
judgment. 
As explained below, we affirm the circuit court's Final
 
Judgment.

I. Case Background
 
This case arises out of a motor vehicle collision on
 
February 10, 1999, wherein Willis was a passenger in an uninsured
 
vehicle driven by Defendant Craig Swain (Swain), which rear-ended
 
another vehicle. At the time of the collision, Willis was
 
enrolled under a "certificate policy" issued at no cost to her
 
through Hawaii's JUP pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)§
 
431:10C-407(b)(2) (Supp. 1998). Willis's certificate policy was
 
effective from July 2, 1998 to July 2, 1999. JUP certificate
 
policies at the time of the accident provided "personal injury
 
protection benefits and bodily injury and property damage
 
policies" for various classes of persons, including licensed
 
drivers receiving a certain type of public assistance benefits. 
HRS § 431:10C-407(b)(2). Willis's certificate policy with First
 
Insurance did not include uninsured motorist (UM) coverage.
 
Due to the collision, Willis sustained bodily injuries,
 
received medical treatment and incurred medical bills. After the
 
accident, Willis also applied for benefits under the JUP
 
"assigned claim" plan, which was assigned to First Insurance
 
pursuant to HRS § 431:10C-408 (Supp. 1998).2 At the time of the
 
2 In Willis I, the Hawai' i Supreme Court explained: 
Willis's certificate policy would have been governed by
HRS § 431:10C–407, whereas her later "assigned claim" sought
"last resort" coverage under HRS § 431:10C–408. A concise
clarification of the JUP's two distinct functions is
 provided by HAR § 16–23–67 (1999):
(a) The [JUP] is intended to provide motor vehicle
insurance and optional additional insurance in a
convenient and expeditious manner for ... persons who
otherwise are in good faith entitled to, but unable to
obtain, motor vehicle insurance and optional
additional insurance through ordinary methods.
Insurers will pool their losses and bona fide expenses
under [the] JUP to prevent the imposition of any
inordinate burden on any particular insurer.
(b) Another part of the JUP consists of the assignment
thereto of claims of victims for whom no policy is
applicable, such as the hit-and-run victim who is not

accident, HRS § 431:10C-408(a) stated:
 
§431:10C-408 Assigned claims.  (a) Each person
sustaining accidental harm, or such person's legal
representative, may, except as provided in subsection (b),
obtain the motor vehicle insurance benefits through the plan
whenever:
 
(1)	 No insurance benefits under motor vehicle
 insurance policies are applicable to the
accidental harm;
 
(2)	 No such insurance benefits applicable to the
accidental harm can be identified; or
 
(3)	 The only identifiable insurance benefits under
motor vehicle insurance policies applicable to
the accidental harm will not be paid in full
because of financial inability of one or more
self-insurers or insurers to fulfill their
 obligations.
 
In Willis I, the Hawai' i Supreme Court addressed 
whether Willis was entitled to benefits under the assigned claim
 
plan.3 The supreme court vacated the circuit court's grant of
 
summary judgment in favor of First Insurance, ruling as follows:
 
we hold that the circuit court erred in awarding summary
judgment in favor of First Insurance and against Willis.
Accordingly, we vacate the circuit court's July 24, 2003
judgment insofar as it dismissed Willis's action against
First Insurance and remand for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion. On remand, to the extent that
the trier of fact finds that Willis's post-July 2, 1999
medical expenses remain unpaid and her assigned claim
complies with the Motor Vehicle Insurance Law in other
respects, the circuit court shall order First Insurance to
tender the appropriate benefits under the assigned claims
 program.

covered by a motor vehicle insurance policy. The
losses and expenses under the assigned claims program
are pro-rated among and shared by all motor vehicle
insurers and self-insurers.

'i at 187 n.6, 145 P.3d at 730 n.6. 
3 In the circuit court, First Insurance had argued that Willis was not
entitled to assigned claim benefits because she elected not to purchaseadditional UM coverage under her certificate policy and thus her assignedclaim was an attempt to obtain free UM coverage which she previously chose notto purchase. The circuit court granted summary judgment for First Insurance.Willis I, 112 Hawai' i at 187-88, 145 P.3d at 730-31.

  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
112 Hawai' i at 191, 145 P.3d at 734 (emphasis added). The 
supreme court did not address Willis's other claims, including 
the bad faith claim.4 
Following Willis I, First Insurance paid Willis
 
benefits under the JUP assigned claims program. Upon remand to
 
the circuit court, First Insurance then moved for summary
 
judgment with respect to Willis's remaining claims, arguing that
 
it had complied with the supreme court's decision and hence there
 
was no basis for any further recovery under the other claims. 
In an order issued on October 3, 2007, the circuit
 
court first found that "[i]t is undisputed that First Insurance
 
has paid all benefits that Plaintiff is entitled to recover as an
 
assigned claims claimant under the Hawaii Joint Underwriting Plan
 
pursuant to and in compliance with the Supreme Court's opinion in
 
this case."5 The circuit court then granted First Insurance's
 
motion for summary judgment on all of Willis's remaining claims,
 "including, without limitation, any claim for breach of contract,
 
misrepresentation, negligent or intentional infliction of
 
emotional distress, unfair claims practices, unfair or deceptive
 
acts or practices in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes §480-2
 
or bad faith." With respect to the bad faith claim, the circuit
 
court held "as a matter of law that there is no cognizable claim
 
for bad faith in the absence of a contract." The circuit court
 
further held "that the published opinion of the Hawaii Supreme
 
Court in this case settled an open question of law and therefore
 
pursuant to . . . Enoka v. AIG Hawaii Ins., Co., Inc., 109
 
4 In another opinion, the Hawai' i Supreme Court addressed Willis's
motion for attorney's fees and costs incurred on appeal. See Willis v. Swain, 
113 Haw. 246, 151 P.3d 727 (2006) (Willis II). In that opinion, the court
held that Willis was not entitled to statutory attorney's fees pursuant toHRS § 431:10C-211 (2005 Repl.), but that Willis was entitled to costs fromFirst Insurance in the amount of $639.00. Id. at 250, 151 P.3d at 731. 
Willis II is further discussed infra.

 Willis does not contest this finding.

  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Hawai'i 537, 128 P.3d 850 (2006), there was no bad faith on the 
part of First Insurance." 
On December 22, 2008, Willis timely filed a notice of 
appeal from the circuit court's December 11, 2008 Final Judgment. 
II. Discussion
 
In her opening brief, Willis expressly states that she
 
is not appealing the circuit court's decision to dismiss her
 
claims for breach of contract, misrepresentation and unfair
 
claims practices. Moreover, although her points of error refer
 
in part to claims for emotional distress, Willis fails to present
 
any argument regarding the circuit court's dismissal of such
 
purported claims. Thus, any points of error regarding claims for
 
negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress have
 
been waived.6 The only claim raised in Willis's points of error
 
and argued is her claim for bad faith.
 
We review the circuit court's grant of summary judgment 
de novo. Enoka, 109 Hawai' i at 543, 128 P.3d at 856. 
[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there
is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. A
fact is material if proof of that fact would have the effect
of establishing or refuting one of the essential elements of
a cause of action or defense asserted by the parties. The
evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the
non-moving party. In other words, we must view all of the
evidence and the inferences drawn therefrom in the light
most favorable to the party opposing the motion.
 
Id. at 543-44, 128 P.3d at 856-57 (citation omitted).
 
In this case, as a matter of law, Willis has no
 
cognizable claim for bad faith arising from her assigned claim
 
because there is no underlying contract of insurance. See
 
6 See Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure, Rule 28(b)(7) ("Points not
argued may be deemed waived."); Buscher v. Boning, 114 Hawai' i 202, 221, 159
P.3d 814, 833 (2007).

Simmons v. Puu, 105 Hawai' i 112, 94 P.3d 667 (2004). Although 
the parties fail to discuss Simmons in their briefs, its analysis 
of bad faith claims is particularly instructive in this case. In 
Simmons, plaintiff Curtis Simmons operated a vehicle that was 
involved in an accident with another vehicle owned and self-
insured by Hertz. Among other claims, Simmons asserted a bad 
faith claim against Hertz. In holding that Simmons did not have 
a claim for bad faith against self-insured Hertz, the Hawai' i 
Supreme Court determined that a contract must underlie the tort 
of bad faith. 105 Hawai' i at 118-23, 94 P.3d at 673-78. 
The court in Simmons analyzed its prior decision in 
Best Place, Inc. v. Penn America Insurance Co., 82 Hawai' i 120, 
920 P.2d 334 (1996), which had recognized the bad faith cause of 
action in Hawai' i, and noted that "this court largely relied on 
contract law as fundamental to its adoption of the bad faith claim for relief[.]" Simmons, 105 Hawai' i at 118, 94 P.3d at 
673. The supreme court further explained:
 
Best Place neither discussed nor contemplated the
application of the tort of bad faith settlement practices in
the absence of an insurance contract. See id. at 127–30,
920 P.2d at 341–44. This court succinctly stated that "the
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, implied in
 all contracts, is the legal principle underlying the
adoption of a bad faith tort cause of action in the
insurance context[.]" Id. at 131, 920 P.2d at 345 (emphasis
added); see also id. at 132, 920 P.2d at 346 (holding "that
there is a legal duty, implied in a first- and third-party
 insurance contract, that the insurer must act in good faith
in dealing with its insured, and a breach of that duty of
good faith gives rise to an independent cause of action"
(emphasis added)). Even in downplaying the necessity of "the
fiduciary duty on the part of the insurer in the third-party
context ... [as] but one component of a broader duty to act
in good faith and deal fairly with its insured[,]" Best
 Place noted that the raison d'tre of the tort of bad faith
 was to avoid "depriv[ing] the insured of the benefits for
 which he or she ha[d] contracted." Id. at 129, 920 P.2d at
343 (emphasis added).

122, 129, 157 P.3d 561, 568 (App. 2007) ("In Simmons v. Puu, 105 
Hawai'i 112, 94 P.3d 667 (2004), the Hawai' i Supreme Court 
emphasized that the tort of bad faith, as adopted in Best Place, requires a contractual relationship between an insurer and an 
insured."). 
In this case, Willis does not assert that there is an
 
insurance contract from which her bad faith claim arises. 
Rather, she relies on statutory provisions related to assigned
 
claims under the JUP as establishing First Insurance's duty of
 
good faith and fair dealing. Specifically, Willis relies on
 
provisions in HRS § 431:10C-401 (2005 Repl.), § 431:10C-403 (2005
 
Repl.), and § 431:10C-408.

HRS § 431:10C-401 states:
 
§ 431:10C-401. Participation  (a) A joint
underwriting plan is established consisting of all insurers
authorized to write and engage in writing motor vehicle
insurance in this State, except those insurers writing motor
vehicle insurance exclusively under section 431:10C-106.
(b)
 Each insurer shall be a member of the plan and
shall maintain membership as a condition of its licensure to
transact such insurance in this State.
 
In turn, Willis points to the following in HRS § 431:10C-403: 
§ 431:10C-403. Bureau's duties  The bureau shall
 
promptly assign each claim and application, and notify the
claimant or applicant of the identity and address of the
assignee of the claim or application. Claims and
 applications shall be assigned so as to minimize
inconvenience to claimants and applicants. The assignee,
thereafter, has rights and obligations as if it had issued
motor vehicle mandatory public liability and property damage
policies complying with this article applicable to the
accidental harm or other damage, or, in the case of
financial inability of a motor vehicle insurer or self-
insurer to perform its obligations, as if the assignee had
written the applicable motor vehicle insurance policy,
undertaken the self-insurance, or lawfully obligated itself
to pay motor vehicle insurance benefits.
 
7
 For HRS § 431:10C-401 and § 431:10C-403, the versions contained in
the HRS 2005 Replacement volume are the same as applied at the time of the
accident in February 1999. For HRS § 431:10C-408, the applicable version is
contained in the HRS 1998 Supplement.
 
8
   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(Emphasis added). Willis also relies on HRS § 431:10C-408(c)(2),
 
which states:
 
§ 431:10C-408. Assigned claims. . . . 
(c) Any person eligible for benefits under this part,
and who becomes eligible to file a claim or an action
against the mandatory bodily injury liability or property
damage liability policies, shall, upon the bureau's
determination of eligibility, be entitled to:
 . . . 
(2) The rights of claim and action against the
insurer , assigned under section 431:10C-403,
with reference to the mandatory bodily injuryliability policy for accidental harm, and withreference to the mandatory property damageliability policy for property damage sustained. 
(Emphasis added).8 
Given the analysis in Simmons and its "[h]aving 
established that the common law tort of bad faith settlement 
practices arises only from a contract of insurance," 105 Hawai' i 
at 123, 94 P.3d at 678, Willis's reliance on the JUP statutory provisions for assigned claims fails to establish that she has a 
claim for bad faith against First Insurance. 
Previously in this case, addressing Willis's claim for
 
9
attorney's fees incurred on appeal under HRS § 431:10C-211,  the
8 Alternatively, Willis cites to HRS § 431:10C-401 and argues that she
is "an intended beneficiary of the JUP assigned claim policy because there is
a contractual relationship between the State of Hawaii and First Insurance asit relates to the administration and assignment of the JUP assigned claims,and as a condition of insurance companies doing business in the State ofHawaii." However, HRS § 431:10C-401 does not require, and Willis does notpoint to, a contract between the State of Hawai' i and First Insurance as it 
relates to assigned claims.
9 HRS § 431:10C-211(a) provides, in relevant part:
 
§431:10C-211 Attorney's fees.  (a) A person making a claim
for personal injury protection benefits may be allowed an
award of a reasonable sum for attorney's fees, and
reasonable costs of suit in an action brought ... against an
insurer who denies ... a claim for benefits under the
 policy, unless the court upon judicial proceeding ...
determines that the claim was unreasonable, fraudulent,
excessive, or frivolous. 
(Emphasis added).
 
9
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
supreme court has already rejected Willis's argument that her
 
assigned claim should be regarded and treated as a "policy." 
Willis II, 113 Hawai' i at 249, 151 P.3d at 730. Significantly, 
the supreme court recognized that Willis's assigned claim was not
 contractual in nature.
 
We agree with First Insurance that Willis's asserted basis
for fees, HRS § 431:10C-211(a), see supra note 1, which
applies where an insurer has "denie[d] . . . a claim . . .
under [a] policy" (emphasis added), is unavailing. Assigned
claims are creatures of statute and do not arise out of a
 
contractual relationship. On the other hand, Black's Law
Dictionary defines a "policy" in the relevant sense as "[a]
document containing a contract of insurance." Black's Law
 Dictionary 1196 (8th ed. 2004) (emphasis added) . . . . 
Id. (citations omitted, underline emphasis added).10
 
Thus, as already determined in Willis II, Willis's
 
assigned claim does not arise from a contract, and given the
 
holding in Simmons, the circuit court properly granted summary
 
judgment in favor of First Insurance on Willis's claim for bad
 
faith.
 
In light of the above, we need not and therefore do not
 
address the other points of error raised by Willis. We need not
 
decide whether the circuit court erred in holding that Willis I
 
settled an "open question of law" precluding a bad faith claim
 
under Enoka. We also need not determine if there were genuine
 
issues of material fact that precluded summary judgment on the
 
bad faith claim. Rather, as stated, Willis's bad faith claim
 
fails as a matter of law for lack of an underlying contract.
 
10 In Willis II, the supreme court also distinguished between assigned 
claims and a certificate policy, stating that "whereas the legislature
enunciated that a certificate policy 'shall be deemed a policy for thepurposes of [the Insurance Code, HRS ch. 431],' the legislature did notsimilarly categorize assigned claims." 113 Hawai' i at 249, 151 P.3d at 730
(citations omitted). 
10
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Additionally, because Willis does not have a cause of
 
action for bad faith against First Insurance, the circuit court
 
properly denied Willis's motion to compel discovery against First
 
Insurance relevant to her bad faith claim.
 
III. Conclusion
 
For the reasons set forth above, the circuit court's
 
Final Judgment entered on December 11, 2008 is affirmed.
