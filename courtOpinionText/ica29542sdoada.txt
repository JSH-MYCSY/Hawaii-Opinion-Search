2007 (Criminal No. 08-1-272), and February 1, 2008 (Criminal No.
 
08-1-273). There was undisputed evidence that Nakatsu had two
 prior convictions for driving without a license and two prior
 convictions for driving without a motor vehicle insurance policy,
 for offenses committed on February 28, 2006, and September 1,
 2006. 
I. 
Nakatsu appeals from the Judgments entered in the three 
criminal cases. On appeal, Nakatsu raises challenges to his convictions that are based on his claim that because he is a citizen of the Kingdom of Hawai» i, he was not subject to 
prosecution by the State of Hawai» i. Nakatsu argues: (1) in all 
three appeals, that (a) the Circuit Court erred in not allowing 
him to defend himself based on the illegitimacy of the State of Hawai» i; and (b) his appointed counsel provided ineffective 
assistance because counsel did not agree with Nakatsu's "Hawaiian Sovereignty" defenses and was being paid by the State of Hawai» i; 
(2) in Appeal No. 29542, that the Circuit Court was biased because it restricted Nakatsu's ability to present his defense related to the Kingdom of Hawai» i; (3) in Appeal No. 29543, that 
the Circuit Court erred in not finding that Nakatsu was entitled to a defense based on his reasonable belief that he was in the Kingdom of Hawai» i and not the State of Hawai» i and therefore not 
subject to the laws of the State of Hawai» i when he was cited; 
and (4) in Appeal No. 29559, that the Circuit Court erred in not dismissing the case based on Nakatsu's claim that he was in the Kingdom of Hawai» i and not in the State of Hawai» i at the time of 
the alleged offense. In addition, Nakatsu argues: (1) in Appeal 
No. 29559, that the Circuit Court erred by providing the jury with instructions that defined the terms "road machine" and "implement of husbandry"; and (2) in Appeal Nos. 29542 and 29559, that the Circuit Court erred by failing to instruct the jury in 
accordance with Nakatsu's interpretation of the requirements for 
3
     
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the enhanced repeat-offender penalties under HRS ÿÿ 431:10C­
117(a)(5) (Supp. 2011).2
 
As discussed below, we conclude that the arguments
 
Nakatsu raises on appeal lack merit, and we affirm the Judgments
 of the Circuit Court.
 
II.
 
We resolve the issues raised by Nakatsu on appeal as
 
follows:
 
A.
 
We reject Nakatsu's arguments that are based on his 
claims that he was not subject to prosecution by the State of Hawai» i, or had valid defenses to the charges, because he is a 
citizen of the Kingdom of Hawai» i or because the State of Hawai» i 
is illegitimate. See State v. Fergerstrom, 106 Hawai» i 43, 55, 
101 P.3d 652, 664 (App. 2004) ("[T]he State of Hawai» i has lawful 
jurisdiction over all persons operating motor vehicles on public 
roads or highways within the State of Hawai» i. Persons claiming 
to be citizens of the Kingdom of Hawai» i and not of the State of 
Hawai» i are not exempt from the laws of the State of Hawai» i 
applicable to all persons (citizens and non-citizens) operating motor vehicles on public roads and highways within the State of Hawai» i."), aff'd, 106 Hawai» i 41, 101 P.3d 225 (2004). 
Nakatsu's contention that the Circuit Court was biased 
because it restricted Nakatsu's ability to present his defense related to the Kingdom of Hawai» i is without merit. The 
restrictions imposed by the Circuit Court were proper. Moreover, parties may not predicate their claims of bias on adverse rulings 
by a court. State v. Ross , 89 Hawai» i 371, 378, 974 P.2d 11, 18 
(1998).  
We reject Nakatsu's argument that his appointed counsel
 
provided ineffective assistance because counsel did not agree
 
2
 We assume, without deciding, that the requirements for the repeat-
offender penalties under HRS ÿÿ 431:10C-117(a)(5) constitute an element of the
charged offense in resolving this appeal.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
with Nakatsu's "Hawaiian Sovereignty" defenses and was being paid 
by the State of Hawai» i.3 Nakatsu does not cite any authority 
for his contention that these circumstances demonstrate that his counsel provided ineffective assistance. Nakatsu also fails to show that there were specific errors or omissions reflecting lack of skill, judgment, or diligence on the part of his appointed counsel or that counsel's actions resulted in the withdrawal or substantial impairment of a potentially meritorious defense. See 
State v. Richie, 88 Hawai» i 19, 39, 960 P.2d 1227, 1247 (1998). 
We conclude that Nakatsu's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is without merit. 
B.
 
HRS ÿÿ 286-105(2) (2007) exempts from driver's licencing
 
requirements "[a]ny person while driving or operating any road
 
machine . . . or implement of husbandry temporarily operated or
 moved on a highway[.] With respect to Criminal No. 08-1-272, it
 is undisputed that Nakatsu was driving a 1990 Mazda Miata
 convertible on a public road or highway when he was cited for
 driving without a license. Nakatsu claimed that because he was
 using the Mazda Miata to obtain water and feed for the animals on
 his farm, he was driving a "road machine" or "implement of
 husbandry" and was exempt from driver's licencing requirements
 under HRS ÿÿ 286-105(2).
 
The terms "road machine" and "implement of husbandry"
 
are not specifically defined in HRS Chapter 286. On appeal,
 Nakatsu contends that the Circuit Court erred by instructing the
 jury on the definition of these terms because there is no
 
definition in the statutes. Nakatsu does not challenge the
 substance of the Circuit Court's definitions but contends that
 the Circuit Court's action in defining terms that were not
 statutorily defined was improper. Nakatsu cites no authority to
 support his claim, and we reject it as being without merit. The 
3 The record reflects that appointed counsel asserted
defenses on Nakatsu's behalf related to the Kingdom of Hawai» i. 
5
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Circuit Court clearly has the authority to instruct the jury on
 
the meaning of terms that are not defined by statute.
 
C.
 
HRS ÿÿ 431:10C-117(a)(5) provides:
 
In the case of multiple convictions for driving without a
valid motor vehicle insurance policy within a five-year
period from any prior offense, the court, in addition to any
other penalty, shall impose the following penalties: 
(A) Imprisonment of not more than thirty days; 
(B) Suspension or revocation of the motor vehicle
registration plates of the vehicle involved; 
(C) Impoundment, or impoundment and sale, of themotor vehicle for the costs of storage and othercharges incident to seizure of the vehicle, or
any other cost involved pursuant to section431:10C-301; or 
(D) Any combination of those penalties
[.] 
(Emphasis added.) 
Nakatsu argues that the Circuit Court erred in
 
instructing the jury because he contends that HRS ÿÿ 431:10C­
117(a)(5) should be construed to require proof of "two offenses
 or more within five years before the prior offense . . . ." We 
conclude that Nakatsu's argument is without merit. 
We construe HRS ÿÿ 431:10C-117(a)(5) as requiring only
 
one conviction prior to the charged offense. Prior to being
 amended in 1996, HRS ÿÿ 431:10C-117(a)(5)
4 provided:
 
In the case of multiple violations , the court, in addition
to any other penalty, shall impose the following penalties:
 
(A)	 Imprisonment of not more than thirty days;
 
(B)	 Suspension or revocation of the motor vehicle
registration plates of the vehicle involved;
 
(C)	 Impoundment, or impoundment and sale, of the motor
vehicle for the costs of storage and other charges
incident to seizure of the vehicle, or any other cost
involved pursuant to section 431:10C-301; or
 
4 Prior to being amended in 1996, the predecessor to HRS ÿÿ 431:10C­
117(a)(5) was set forth in HRS ÿÿ 431:10C-117(a)(4). See HRS ÿÿ 431:10C-117
(1993). The 1996 amendments renumbered subsection (a)(4) as subsection
(a)(5). For simplicity, we will use HRS ÿÿ 431:10C-117(a)(5) when referring to
the subsection (a)(4) predecessor to HRS ÿÿ 431:10C-117(a)(5). 
6
    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(D)	 Any combination of those penalties.
 
(Emphasis added). In 1996, this provision was amended by
 
replacing "multiple violations" with "multiple convictions," and
 imposing a five-year time limit for a qualifying prior
 conviction. See 1996 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 20, ÿÿ 1 at 32. The
 
1996 amendments changed HRS ÿÿ 431:10C-117(a)(5) as follows, with
 deleted material in brackets and new material underscored:
 
In the case of multiple [violations] convictions for driving
without a valid no-fault policy within a five-year period
from any prior conviction, the court, in addition to any
other penalty, shall impose the following penalties:
 
(A)	 Imprisonment of not more than thirty days;
 
(B)	 Suspension or revocation of the motor vehicle
registration plates of the vehicle involved;
 
(C)	 Impoundment, or impoundment and sale, of the motor
vehicle for the costs of storage and other charges
incident to seizure of the vehicle, or any other cost
involved pursuant to section 431:10C 301; or
 
(D)	 Any combination of those penalties.
 
Id.
 
Prior to the 1996 amendments, HRS ÿÿ 431:10C-117(a)(5)
 
clearly only required one prior conviction as a condition for
 
imposing the enhanced penalties for the charged offense. 
Although the 1996 amendments imposed a five-year limitation on
 the prior conviction, there is nothing in the legislative history
 to suggest that the Legislature intended to require more than one
 prior conviction in order to impose the enhanced penalties.
5
 
In view of this legislative history, and our
 
examination of the statutory language, we construe the phrase "in
 
5 The committee reports accompanying the 1996 amendments reveal that the
primary purpose of the legislation was to change a different subsection
(subsection (a)(3)) to exempt first-time offenders within a five-year period
of driving without a valid no-fault policy from the requirement of maintaining
proof of financial responsibility. H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 791-96, 1996
House Journal at 1338-39; S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 2302, 1996 Senate Journal
at 1095; S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 2600, 1996 Senate Journal at 1213. The only
apparent reference in the committee reports to the amendment to subsection
(a)(5) was the statement that the legislation "[l]imits penalties for multiple
convictions to a five-year period from any prior conviction." S. Stand. Comm.
Rep. No. 2302, 1996 Senate Journal at 1095.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the case of multiple convictions" set forth in HRS ÿÿ 431:10C­
117(a)(5) to mean that the currently charged offense is to be
 counted as one of the convictions in determining whether the case
 is a case of "multiple convictions." This interpretation is not
 only supported by the statute's legislative history, but by the
 understanding that the enhanced penalties do not come into play
 until the defendant is convicted of the charged offense. In
 addition, if the charged offense were not included as one of the
 multiple convictions, the five-year period would not be tied to
 the charged offense. This would mean, for example, that a
 defendant who twenty years ago committed and was convicted of two
 offenses for driving without a motor vehicle insurance policy
 within a five-year period would be subject to the enhanced
 
penalties under HRS ÿÿ 431:10C-117(a)(5) on the currently charged
 offense. There is no basis for believing that this was the
 Legislature's intent. We therefore construe HRS ÿÿ 431:10C­117(a)(5) as requiring only one conviction prior to the charged
 offense. 
We also disagree with Nakatsu's contention that the
 
relevant period is the five-year period before  the prior offense. 
Nakatsu's contention is inconsistent with the language of HRS 
ÿÿ 431:10C-117(a)(5) which uses the term "within" rather than
 "before." The obvious purpose of imposing the five-year
 limitation was to allow a person to avoid the enhanced penalties,
 to wipe the slate clean, by refraining from committing and being
 convicted of another offense for the requisite time period. 
Nakatsu's interpretation would defeat this purpose by severing
 
the proximity link between the prior offense and the charged
 offense. Accordingly, we reject Nakatsu's claim that under HRS 
ÿÿ 431:10C-117(a)(5), the relevant period is the five-year period
 before the prior offense.
