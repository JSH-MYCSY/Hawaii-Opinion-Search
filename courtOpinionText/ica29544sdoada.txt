APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT

 
(CIVIL NO. 07-1-0032(1))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER

 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant-Appellant Marlon Quan
 
(Quan) appeals from the "Order Granting Defendant/Cross-Claimant
 
California Bear Credit Union's Motion for Summary Judgment as to
 the Issue of Lien Priority Filed on August 7, 2008 and Denying
 Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment as to the Issue of Lien
 Priority Filed on October 16, 2008" (Order Granting Bear Credit's
 MSJ) filed on November 24, 2008 in the Circuit Court of the
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Second Circuit (circuit court).1 The circuit court granted
 
"Defendant California Bear Credit Union's Motion for Summary
 
Judgment as to the Issue of [Lien] Priority" (Bear Credit's MSJ)
 and denied Quan's "Motion for Summary Judgment as to the Issue of
 Lien Priority" (Quan's MSJ).
 
On appeal, Quan contends the circuit court abused its
 
discretion by denying Quan's MSJ and granting Bear Credit's MSJ
 because
 
(1) Quan's mortgage constitutes a purchase money
 
mortgage and is therefore entitled to priority over the mortgage
 of Defendant/Counterclaimant/Cross-claimant-Appellee California
 Bear Credit Union (Bear Credit);
 
(2) Bear Credit's mortgage can only attach itself to
 
the subject after-acquired property -- a parcel of land in Hana,
 Maui, identified as TMK (2)1-3-005-035 (the Property) -- in the
 condition in which the Property came into the hands of
 Defendant/Cross-Claim Defendant-Appellee Liquid Financial Group,
 Inc. (LFG); and
 
(3) equity warrants a finding that Quan's mortgage is
 
superior to Bear Credit's mortgage.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude that
 Quan's appeal is without merit.
 
The circuit court did not err in granting Bear Credit's 
MSJ and denying Quan's MSJ as to the issue of lien priority. In its Order Granting Bear Credit's MSJ, the circuit court correctly held that pursuant to Hawai
'i Revised Statutes §§ 506-1 and 506­
2(b), Bear Credit's mortgage filed on January 11, 2006 has full legal priority ahead of Quan's mortgage filed on July 31, 2006. 
Therefore, 
1
 The Honorable Joel E. August presided.
