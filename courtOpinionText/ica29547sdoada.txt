SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER

 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
In this employment discrimination case, Plaintiff-
Appellant Gregory Carter (Carter) appeals from the Judgment filed
 
on November 25, 2008 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit1

circuit court). The circuit court entered judgment in favor of
 
Defendant-Appellee University of Hawaii (UH) and against Carter
 
as to all of Carter's claims against UH. The circuit court also
 
dismissed all other claims by or against any other party.
 
On appeal, Carter raises ten points of error and three
 
"questions." As to the points of error, Carter essentially
 
contends that the evidence presented at trial contradicts the
 
October 14, 2008 Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law
 
(FOFs/COLs) because the FOFs/COLs are not supported by evidence,
 
the FOFs/COLS are erroneous, evidence was improperly excluded,
 
circuit court Judge McKenna should have recused herself, and his
 
former attorney provided ineffective counsel. Carter's
 
"questions" on appeal ask whether the circuit court, in the
 
motions hearing of January 10, 2002, erred when it allowed UH's
 
attorneys to represent the individual defendants and when it
 
dismissed Carter's Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 378-2 (Supp.
 
2008) claim. Carter also asks whether UH properly submitted its
 
proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the circuit
 
court.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude that
 
Carter's appeal is without merit.2
 
Therefore,

 Although Carter correctly posits that Title VII of the Civil Rights
Law and HRS Chapter 378 prohibit racial discrimination against "white males,"
he failed to demonstrate any error in the circuit court's disposition of his
claims.
