STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
ENRICO CALARA, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CRIMINAL NO. 08-1-0977)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Enrico Calara (Calara) appeals from
 
the Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence entered
 
December 15, 2008 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit1
 
(circuit court). Calara was convicted of sexual assault in the
 fourth degree, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes
 
(HRS) ยง 707-733 (1993).
 
On appeal, Calara contends the circuit court erred:
 
(1) by precluding Calara from presenting evidence of
 
the drug pipe found in the room of the complaining witness (CW),
 
1
 The Honorable Reynaldo D. Graulty presided.
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and from cross-examining CW as to her drug use for purposes of
 
attacking her perception and recollection;
 
(2) in admitting Honolulu Police Department (HPD)
 
Detective Denault's (Denault) testimony that probable cause was
 
established to arrest Calara for sexual assault in the fourth
 
degree;
 
(3) in admitting CW's statement to a third party (TP)
 
regarding Calara's alleged sexual assault as an "excited
 
utterance";
 
(4) in admitting evidence of Calara's prior statements
 
to CW in January and February 2007 to establish his intent; and
 
(5) by committing plain error in failing to provide a
 
limiting instruction at the time of CW's testimony regarding
 
Calara's alleged prior statements and as part of the final charge
 
to the jury.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Calara's
 
appeal is without merit.
 
(1) Calara contends "[t]he circuit court violated
 
[his] right to present a complete defense by precluding him from
 
introducing evidence of [CW's] drug pipe and by cross-examining
 
[CW] about her drug use for the purposes of attacking her
 
perception and recollection." We disagree.
 
Calara's offer of proof regarding the pipe was that his
 
wife would testify that she discovered a pipe in the room in
 
which CW had been staying and that his wife had called HPD to do
 
a test on the pipe, which smelled "funny." 
HPD did not conduct a
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
test on the pipe and there was no police report regarding the
 
wife's claim of finding the pipe.
 
In excluding the wife's proffered testimony, the
 
circuit court properly ruled that "the evidence is so remote, so
 
tangential and so unreliable as to whether or not this is [CW's]
 
[sic] pipe and whether she smoked it . . . the early morning
 
hours of March 13th, that the court should not allow this." The
 
circuit court also properly noted that the evidence was "more
 
prejudicial than probative."
 
Furthermore, the circuit court did not foreclose Calara 
from cross-examining CW regarding possible drug use on the day of 
the event. State v. Sabog, 108 Hawai' i 102, 109-11, 117 P.3d 
834, 841-43 (App. 2005). Calara was entitled to cross-examine CW as to whether any drug use affected her perception and 
recollection of the incident. 
(2) Calara contends the circuit court erred in
 
admitting Denault's testimony "because the testimony not only
 
improperly bolstered [CW's] credibility but also was irrelevant
 
and unduly prejudicial."
 
Denault testified that he determined "there was
 
probable cause established" to arrest Calara for misdemeanor
 
sexual assault after CW reviewed and confirmed her previous
 
written statement and positively identified Calara in the
 
photographic lineup.
 
Calara did not object to this testimony at trial. "It 
is well settled that objections not raised or properly preserved 
at trial will not be considered on appeal." State v. Gray, 108 
Hawai'i 124, 134, 117 P.3d 856, 866 (App. 2005) (quoting Craft v. 
Peebles, 78 Hawai' i 287, 294, 893 P.2d 138, 145 (1995)). 
However, appellate courts may recognize a plain error that 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
affects a defendant's substantial rights. State v. Miller, 122 
Hawai'i 92, 100, 223 P.3d 157, 165 (2010). 
Calara has not demonstrated that his substantial rights 
were affected by Denault's testimony. The three cases on which 
Calara relies are clearly distinguishable. State v. Batangan, 71 
Haw. 552, 799 P.2d 48 (1990), State v. Morris, 72 Haw. 527, 825 P.2d 1051 (1992), and State v. Ryan, 112 Hawai' i 136, 144 P.3d 
584 (App. 2006) all involved witnesses offering opinions on victim-complainants' credibility.
2 Denault's testimony, on the 
other hand, explained the events that led to Calara's arrest. 
(3) Calara contends the circuit court erred in
 
admitting CW's statement to TP regarding Calara's sexual assault
 as an "excited utterance." The morning after the incident, CW
 
informed TP that Calara entered her room and touched her breast
 
while she was sleeping.
 
2 Briefly, State v. Batangan, 71 Haw. 552, 799 P.2d 48 (1990), involved 
an expert witness who testified that the complainant in an alleged child abuse
case was believable and had been abused by the defendant. Id. at 554-55, 799 
P.2d at 50. The Hawai' i Supreme Court ruled that the circuit court
erroneously admitted the expert's testimony and vacated the defendant'sconviction. Id. at 562, 799 P.2d at 54. 
In State v. Morris, 72 Haw. 527, 825 P.2d 1051 (1992), an expert witness
testified for the State in the prosecution of defendant for sexual assault ofa minor. Despite the absence of any witnesses or physical evidence, andwithout having ever examined the victim, the State's medical expert testifiedthat the victim had been subject to chronic sexual abuse. Id. at 528-29, 825 
P.2d at 1051-52. The Hawai' i Supreme Court ruled that the testimony, based
solely on the child's statements, amounted to an opinion as to the credibilityof the child and was therefore inadmissible. Id. 
In State v. Ryan, 112 Hawai' i 136, 144 P.3d 584 (App. 2006), a domestic
abuse case, two investigating officers were repeatedly asked and testifiedthat they had no reason not to believe the complaining witness's allegations.Id. at 139-40, 144 P.3d at 587-88. The circuit court overruled the defense's prompt objections. Id. On appeal, this court held that "it is generally
improper for a witness to express an opinion on the truthfulness of acomplaining witness's allegations []" because "[s]uch testimony mayimpermissibly invade the province of the jury to determine the credibility ofwitnesses and determine the facts." Id. at 140, 144 P.3d at 588 (citationsomitted).

An excited utterance is admissible as an exception to 
the general ban on hearsay. Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 
803(b)(2) (1993). "The assumption underlying [the excited 
utterance] exception is that a person under the sway of 
excitement precipitated by an external startling event will not 
have the reflective capacity essential for fabrication and that, 
consequently, any utterance will be spontaneous and trustworthy." 
State v. Zukevich, 84 Hawai' i 203, 207, 932 P.2d 340, 344 (1997). 
(citing State v. Clark, 83 Hawai' i 289, 296, 926 P.2d 194, 201 
(1996); State v. Moore, 82 Hawai' i 202, 218, 921 P.2d 122, 138 
(1996)). 
CW's statement to TP were too remote from the alleged 
sexual assault. CW's statement was neither spontaneous nor impulsive. State v. Delos Santos, 124 Hawai' i 130, 137, 238 P.3d 
162, 169 (2010). Rather, it was the result of reflection. 
Although the circuit court erred in admitting TP's 
testimony regarding CW's statement as an excited utterance, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See State v. 
Haili, 103 Hawai' i 89, 100, 79 P.3d 1263, 1274 (2003). TP's 
testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because it was 
cumulative of CW's and Denault's testimony at trial. See Clark, 
83 Hawai' i at 298, 926 P.2d at 203, reconsideration denied, 83 
Hawai'i 545, 928 P.2d 39 (1996) (holding that any error in 
admitting victim's statement as an excited utterance was harmless and cumulative given that victim's similar statements to other 
witnesses were properly admitted). 
(4) Calara contends the circuit court erred in
 
admitting evidence of his prior statements to CW in January and
 
February 2007, which "violated HRE Rules 402, 404(b), and 403[.]"
 
The prior statements concerned Calara's alleged prior sexual
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
advances towards CW in which Calara stated that he "wanted to
 
grab and take her" and later told her he "wanted to take her." 
Calara sought to exclude these statements "as unfairly
 
prejudicial under HRE 404 and irrelevant under HRE 403."
 
Calara's statements were relevant to understanding his
 
state of mind, as well as CW's lack of consent. See HRE Rule 401
 
(1993) (defining relevant evidence as "evidence having any
 tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence
 
to the determination of the action more probable or less probable
 
than it would be without the evidence.").
 
Calara argues that his prior statements "were unfairly
 
prejudicial under HRE Rules 403 and 404(b)." HRE Rule 403 (1993)
 
prohibits the admission of evidence if its "probative value is
 
substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,
 
confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury[.]" Calara
 
argues that "the emotional impact delivered by this prejudicial
 
evidence substantially outweighed any meager probative value to
 
establish guilt or innocence."
 
The probative value of CW's testimony was not
 
substantially outweighed by danger of unfair prejudice,
 
confusion, or misleading the jury. The testimony was important
 
to show "lack of consent, state of mind, and the fact that . . .
 
[Calara] had some sexual interest perhaps in the complaining
 
witness." As the circuit court noted, these statements did not
 
indicate "that [Calara] assaulted [CW] prior to the events of
 
March 13th, 2007, only what his state of mind was, what his
 
intent [was]."
 
(5) Calara contends the circuit court erred by not
 
providing a limiting instruction at the time of CW's testimony
 
regarding Calara's prior statements or as part of the charge to
 
6
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the jury. HRE Rule 105 (1993), which governs limited
 
admissibility, states: "When evidence which is admissible as to
 
one party or for one purpose but not admissible as to another
 
party or for another purpose is admitted, the court, upon
 
request, shall restrict the evidence to its proper scope and
 
instruct the jury accordingly." HRE Rule 105 (emphasis added).
 
Calara did not request a limiting instruction. Calara 
did not demonstrate the circuit court's failure to sua sponte provide a limiting instruction regarding CW's testimony impairing 
his substantial rights. State v. Miller, 122 Hawai' i 92, 100, 
223 P.3d 157, 165 (2010). Calara's statements to CW were admitted to show his state of mind and CW's lack of consent. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment of Conviction
 
and Probation Sentence entered December 15, 2008 in the Circuit
 of the First Circuit is affirmed.
