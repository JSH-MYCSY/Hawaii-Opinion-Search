DONALD T. OKIMOTO and KUMIKO OKIMOTO, Plaintiffs-Appellants, v.
KURT I. UYEHARA, D.D.S., Defendant-Appellee, and JOHN DOES 1-20,

Defendants
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 06-1-0153)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
In this dental malpractice case, Plaintiffs-Appellants
 
Donald T. Okimoto and Kumiko Okimoto (collectively, Plaintiffs)
 
appeal from the December 16, 2008 order denying Plaintiffs'
 
motion for reconsideration of a October 14, 2008 judgment entered
 
1
by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit  (circuit court) that
granted summary judgment to Defendant-Appellee Kurt I. Uyehara,
 
D.D.S.
 (Dr. Uyehara).
 
On appeal, Plaintiffs argue that the circuit court
 
erred (1) "in granting summary judgment for failure to list
 expert witnesses in a final naming of witnesses, when those
 
experts were previously named in answers to interrogatories, and
 
the substance of their expert testimony disclosed;" and (2) "in
 
requiring expert testimony to establish negligence where Dr.
 
Uyehara stitched [Mr.] Okimoto's lip to his gums" because the

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"common knowledge" exception to the expert medical testimony
 
requirement applied.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant law, we resolve Plaintiffs' appeal as
 
follows:
 
(1) The circuit court properly granted Dr. Uyehara's 
motion for summary judgment. Although Plaintiffs argue that the 
pivotal issue here was the circuit court's interpretation of 
Rule 12(l) of the Hawaif i Rules of the Circuit Court, which 
pertains to the final naming of witnesses, the circuit court granted summary judgment because Plaintiffs failed to produce any 
expert testimony to meet their burden of proof when faced with a 
motion for summary judgment, not because Plaintiffs were late in 
designating their expert witnesses. On motions for summary 
judgment, 
[w]here the moving party is the defendant, who does not bear
the ultimate burden of proof at trial, summary judgment is
proper when the nonmoving party-plaintiff[] fails to make a
showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element
essential to that party's case, and on which that party will
bear the burden of proof at trial.
 
Miyashiro v. Roehrig, Roehrig, Wilson & Hara, 122 Hawaif i 461, 
474-75, 228 P.3d 341, 354-55 (App. 2010) (block format and 
citation omitted). 
Plaintiffs had "the burden of establishing a duty owed 
by the defendant to the plaintiff, a breach of that duty, and a 
causal relationship between the breach and the injury suffered." 
Bernard v. Char, 79 Hawaif i 371, 377, 903 P.2d 676, 682 (App. 
1995) (citing 4 F. Lane, Lane Medical Litigation Guide ยง 40.14, at 54 (1993)). As a general rule, "a malpractice case based on 
negligent treatment cannot be established without expert medical 
testimony to support it[.]" Id. To establish negligence, the 
expert must "state that the defendant's treatment deviated from any of the methods of treatment approved by the standards of the 
profession." Id. Furthermore, "a plaintiff must establish 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
proximate or contributory causation through the introduction of 
expert medical testimony." Barbee v. Queen's Med. Ctr., 119 
Hawaifi 136, 158-59, 194 P.3d 1098, 1120-21 (App. 2008). 
Plaintiffs' opposition to summary judgment did not 
include a dental professional's opinion regarding Dr. Uyehara's care relative to the standard of care. Mr. Okimoto's responses 
to interrogatories, which were attached to the memorandum in 
opposition to summary judgment, listed the "the diagnosis and/or 
prognosis of each dental professional expert" who evaluated him 
after Dr. Uyehara's treatment, but did not "set forth such facts 
as would be admissible in evidence," as required by the Hawaif i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 56(e).
2 Because Plaintiffs 
failed to respond to Dr. Uyehara's motion for summary judgment 
with affidavits sufficient to "establish the existence of an 
element essential to [their] case," summary judgment in Dr. 
Uyehara's favor was appropriate. Miyashiro, 122 Hawaif i at 475, 
228 P.3d at 355. See also Eddins v. Morrison, 105 Hawaif i 376, 
378-79, 98 P.3d 247, 249-50 (App. 2004). 
Even if, for the sake of argument, we were to excuse
 
Plaintiffs' late filing of the declarations by two expert
 
dentists, the declarations are insufficient to meet Plaintiffs'
 
burden of proof because neither establishes a causal link between
 
Dr. Uyehara's care and Mr. Okimoto's injuries. Causation is an
 
2 HRCP Rule 56(e) states:
 
Supporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal
knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible
in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant
is competent to testify to the matters stated therein. Sworn
or certified copies of all papers or parts thereof referred
to in an affidavit shall be attached thereto or served
 therewith. The court may permit affidavits to be
supplemented or opposed by depositions, answers to
interrogatories, or further affidavits. When a motion for
summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this
rule, an adverse party may not rest upon the mere
allegations or denials of the adverse party's pleading, but
the adverse party's response, by affidavits or as otherwise
provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing
that there is a genuine issue for trial. If the adverse
party does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate,
shall be entered against the adverse party.

essential element to be proven by expert testimony in a 
malpractice case. See Barbee, 119 Hawaif i at 158-59, 194 P.3d at 
1120-21. Because Plaintiffs as the nonmoving party "failed to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of [their] case 
with respect to which [they have] the burden of proof[,]" Dr. 
Uyehara was "entitled to judgment as a matter of law[.]" 
Miyashiro, 122 Hawaif i at 475, 228 P.3d at 355. 
(2) The "common knowledge" exception to the expert 
medical testimony requirement does not apply here. Although 
"Hawaifi does recognize a 'common knowledge' exception to the 
requirement that a plaintiff must introduce expert medical testimony on causation[,] . . . [t]his exception is 'rare in 
application[.]'" Barbee, 119 Hawaif i at 159, 194 P.3d at 1121 
(citing Medina v. Figuered, 3 Haw. App. 186, 188, 647 P.2d 292, 294 (1982) and Craft v. Peebles, 78 Hawaif i 287, 298, 893 P.2d 
138, 149 (1995)). The circuit court, citing Barbee, gave examples where the exception applied and found that the facts 
alleged in this case were not analogous. We agree. 
We can easily distinguish Lipman v. Lustig, 190 N.E.2d
 
675 (Mass. 1963), and Merola v. Stang, 130 So.2d 119 (Fla. Dist.
 
Ct. App. 1961), the cases Plaintiffs cite on appeal. In Lipman
 
and Merola, the dentists' treatment damaged or threatened damage
 
to body parts unrelated to the tooth being treated. Here, the
 
allegedly damaged body part, the lip, is connected or in close
 
proximity to the gum and jaw operated on, not unrelated to the
 
area receiving treatment. 
Moreover, in Merola, the court noted that although
 
there was no expert testimony, "the jury had the benefit of a
 
photograph of the patient, showing the nature and extent of the
 
cut," which was "no mere scratch, but . . . extensive and
 
disfiguring." 130 So.2d at 120. The pictures proffered by
 
Plaintiffs, in contrast, are not so elucidating. They do not
 
show the allegedly improper stitching and are inadequate to
 
permit a layperson to "conclude from common experience that such

things do not happen if there has been proper skill and care" 
exercised in installing dental implants. Craft, 78 Hawaif i at 
298, 298 P.3d at 149 (internal quotation marks and citation omittted). 
Plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of making a
 
prima facie showing of negligence and causation when faced with
 
summary judgment.
 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Circuit Court of the
 
First Circuit's December 16, 2008 order denying reconsideration
 and the October 14, 2008 judgment in favor of Defendant-Appellee
 
Kurt I. Uyehara, D.D.S., are affirmed.
