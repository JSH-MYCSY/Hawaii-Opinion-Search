OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
HIROKAZU NAKAJIMA,
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant/Appellant,
v.
 
AKI NAKAJIMA,
Defendant/Cross-Plaintiff/Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(FC-DIVORCE NO. 05-1-0587)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
 
(By: 
Foley, J. and Fujise, J., with
Nakamura, C.J. dissenting)
  
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant/Appellant Hirokazu Nakajima
 
(Hirokazu) appeals from various orders entered in the Family
 
1
Court of the Second Circuit  (family court) arising from a
divorce matter involving Defendant/Cross-Plaintiff/Appellee Aki
 
Nakajima (Aki).
 
Hirokazu raises the following points on appeal:
 1.	 The family court erred in finding Avalon Cove
to be a marital asset.

 The Honorable Keith E. Tanaka presided.

2. 	The family court erred in awarding Aki one-
half (½) of a conjectural increase in
Hirokazu's shareholder equity in Avalon Cove
when no evidence was submitted by either
party during the course of the trial that any
such increase occurred.
 
3.	 The family court erred in directing the
parties to submit written real estate
appraisals of the Setagaya and Meguro
properties for the family court's in camera
selection without further hearing or
opportunity for the parties to examine the
authors of said appraisals.
 
4.	 The family court erred in not conducting an
evidentiary hearing to determine the value of
Avalon Cove as of the date of marriage.
 
5.	 The family court erred in allowing a Japanese
translator to testify based on translations
prepared after the May 6, 2008 trial.
 
6.	 The family court erred in its FOF No. 40.
 
7.	 The family court erred in denying Hirokazu's
Request for Protective Order for documents
relating to Avalon Cove over which he had no
control or possession, without finding whether
Hirokazu had the ability to obtain these documents
and erred in awarding sanctions against him for
failing to provide these documents. 
8.	 The family court erred by ordering Hirokazu to pay
Aki's attorney's fees and costs incurred in
legitimating her immigration status and obtaining
an authorization card when that issue was not a
 trial issue nor a property division as specified
by law. 
9.	 The family court erred by ordering the division of
the Ameritrade security account as retirement.
 
10. 	The family court erred in making a decision
regarding property in Japan, which was a question
of foreign law, without first determining the
issue of foreign law.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
11.	 The family court erred when it issued a
garnishment order when a judgment for sums had not
been issued by the court.
 
12.	 The family court erred in its FOFs 26, 27, 28, 29,
30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 41, 42, 43, 44 and
53. 
In family court cases "[a]n interested party, aggrieved
 
by any order or decree of the court, may appeal to the
 
intermediate appellate court for review of questions of law and
 
fact upon the same terms and conditions as in other cases in the
 
circuit court[.]" Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 571-54 (2006
 
Repl.). In circuit court cases, aggrieved parties may appeal
 
from "final judgments, orders or decrees[.]" HRS § 641-1(a)
 
(1993 & Supp. 2012).
 
Hawaii divorce cases involve a maximum of four
 
discrete parts: (1) dissolution of the marriage; (2) child
custody, visitation, and support; (3) spousal support; and
(4) division and distribution of property and debts. 
Black
 
v. Black, 6 Haw. App. 493, 728 P.2d 1303 (1986). In
 Cleveland v. Cleveland, 57 Haw. 519, 559 P.2d 744 (1977),
the Hawaii Supreme Court held that an order which finally
decides parts (1) and (4) is final and appealable even if
part (2) remains undecided. Although we recommend that,
except in exceptionally compelling circumstances, all parts
be decided simultaneously and that part (1) not be finally
decided prior to a decision on all other parts, we conclude
that an order which finally decides part (1) is final and
appealable when decided even if parts (2),(3), and (4)
remain undecided; that parts (2),(3), and (4) are each
separately final and appealable as and when they are
decided, but only if part (1) has previously or
simultaneously been decided; and that if parts (2),(3),
and/or (4) have been decided before part (1) has been
finally decided, they become final and appealable when part
(1) is final decided. 
Eaton v. Eaton, 7 Haw. App. 111, 118-19, 748 P.2d 801, 805 (1987)
 
(footnote omitted). The June 24, 2008 divorce decree appears to
 
satisfy the requirements of appealability, because the June 24,
 
2008 divorce decree (1) dissolved the marriage between Hirokazu
 
and Aki, (2) acknowledged that Hirokazu and Aki had no children,
 
(3) awarded no spousal support to either party, but acknowledged
 
Hirokazu's binding promise to pay Aki's attorney's fees and costs

relating to her obtaining resident alien status in the United 
States, and (4) divided and distributed Hirokazu and Aki's 
property and debts. Therefore, the June 24, 2008 divorce decree 
is an appealable final decree that is appealable pursuant to HRS 
§ 571-54. The orders that the family court entered prior to the 
June 24, 2008 divorce decree are eligible for appellate review by 
way of a timely appeal from the June 24, 2008 divorce decree, 
because "[a]n appeal from a final judgment brings up for review 
all interlocutory orders not appealable directly as of right 
which deal with issues in the case." Ueoka v. Szymanski, 107 
Hawai'i 386, 396, 114 P.3d 892, 902 (2005) (internal quotation 
marks and citation omitted). 
Hirokazu did not file his December 26, 2008 notice of 
appeal within thirty days after entry of the June 24, 2008 
divorce decree, as Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
Rule 4(a)(1) requires. However, if we consider Hirokazu's July 7, 2000 Hawai' i Family Court Rules (HFCR) Rule 60(b) motion for 
clarification as an HFCR Rule 59 motion for reconsideration (despite Hirokazu's citation to HFCR Rule 60(b) rather than HFCR 
2 3
Rule 59), then, pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(3),  Hirokazu would
2 Under analogous circumstances in circuit court cases, we have
"treated a motion for reconsideration brought under HRCP Rule 60(b) as a
motion to alter or amend a judgment brought under HRCP Rule 59(e). "As a result, we held that the notice of appeal was timely brought because themotion for reconsideration . . . tolled the 30-day limitations period . . . tofile the notice of appeal[.]" Simbajon v. Gentry, 81 Hawai' i 193, 196, 914
P.2d 1386, 1389 (App. 1996). 
3 HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) provides:
 
(3) Time to Appeal Affected by Post-Judgment Motions.
If any party files a timely motion for judgment as a matter
of law, to amend findings or make additional findings, for a
new trial, to reconsider, alter or amend the judgment or
order, or for attorney's fees or costs, the time for filing
the notice of appeal is extended until 30 days after entry
of an order disposing of the motion; provided, that the
failure to dispose of any motion by order entered upon the
record within 90 days after the date the motion was filed

have extended the thirty-day deadline under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) by
 
the filing of his July 7, 2008 motion for clarification within
 
4
ten days  after entry of the June 24, 2008 divorce decree, as
HFCR Rule 59(e) requires for a motion for reconsideration.
 
When a party files a post-judgment motion, for the
 
purpose of tolling the time period for filing a notice of appeal
 
pursuant to HRAP 4(a)(3), "the failure to dispose of any motion
 
by order entered upon the record within 90 days after the date
 
the motion was filed shall constitute a denial of the motion." 
HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). 
The ninetieth day after July 7, 2008, was
 
October 6, 2008.5 Therefore, at the end of the day on October 6,
 
2008, Hirokazu's motion for reconsideration was deemed denied
 
pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). Hirokazu did not file his
 
December 26, 2008 notice of appeal within thirty days after the
 
October 6, 2008 as HRAP Rule 4(a) required. Therefore, even if
 
Hirokazu's July 7, 2008 motion for reconsideration extended the
 
time period for filing a notice of appeal pursuant to HRAP Rule
 
4(a)(3), Hirokazu's December 26, 2008 notice of appeal is not
 
timely as to the June 24, 2008 divorce decree (and not timely as
 
to any of the pre-decree interlocutory orders). The failure to
 
file a timely notice of appeal in a civil matter is a
 
jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot waive and the
 
appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise of judicial
 
3(...continued)
shall constitute a denial of the motion.
 
(Emphases added.) 
4
 The tenth calendar day after June 24, 2008, was Friday, July 4,
2008, which was a holiday. Therefore, HRAP Rule 26(a) extended the ten-day
deadline under HFCR Rule 59(e) until Monday, July 7, 2008. 
5
 The ninetieth calendar day after July 7, 2008, was Sunday, August
5, 2008, and, thus, HRAP Rule 26(a) extended the ninety-day time period under
HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) until Monday, August 6, 2008.

29553 is dismissed as untimely.
