I. BACKGROUND
 
This appeal stems from a divorce proceeding between
 
Hirokazu and Aki who were married in Japan on November 19, 2004.
 At the time of the divorce proceedings, Hirokazu was retired and
 marketing himself as a young retired millionaire through
 publications in Japan. He owned numerous assets that included
 accounts at TD Ameritrade Finance, H.S. Trade, and Pregoshare;
 
4
interests in Avalon Cove  ; receivables from Avalon Cove; an
annuity or a retirement account at Nationwide and Oppenheimer

 
funds; and copyrights and royalty rights from Ascom, a publishing
 company which published two books allegedly written by both
 
4
 Appellant incorporated Avalon Cove in Japan in 1998. Avalon Cove
 
used mortgage financing to purchase two income-producing properties in Tokyo:
the Setagaya property and the Meguro property.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hirokazu and Aki.
 
On November 25, 2005, Hirokazu filed his Complaint for
 
Divorce because the marriage was irretrievably broken. Aki
 
answered Hirokazu's Complaint for Divorce and filed a Cross-
Complaint for Divorce on December 22, 2005, claiming she was
 entitled to an order that Hirokazu pay her spousal support.
 
On January 3, 2006, Aki filed a request for production
 
of documents and answers to interrogatories. On May 17, 2006,
 Hirokazu's counsel, Blake Okimoto (Okimoto), certified that
 
Hirokazu's responses to Aki's request for answers to
 
interrogatories would be duly served on Aki's counsel, Junsuke
 Otsuka (Otsuka). Aki alleged that several key documents,
 
specifically those involving Avalon Cove's asset and debts and
 
other investments, were missing from Hirokazu's responses and
 sent a letter to Okimoto on May 16, 2006 identifying the missing
 documents.
 
On June 22, 2006 the parties filed a "Stipulation RE:
 
Temporary Relief" that enjoined and restrained each party from:
 (1) "transferring, encumbering, wasting, or otherwise disposing
 of any real or personal property, except as necessary, over and
 above current income, for the ordinary course of business or for
 usual living expenses[;]" (2) "listing, marketing for sale,
 conveying and/or attempting to sell any real property (domestic
 and/or foreign) owned by the parties[;]" and (3) "listing,
 marketing for sale and/or attempting to sell any business owned
 by the parties[.]" The parties were allowed, however, to buy and
 sell stock in the ordinary course of their business with the
 understanding that assets could be subject to possible document
 production demands in the future.
 
By letter dated July 28, 2006, Hirokazu's counsel,
 
Okimoto, wrote to Otsuka in response to Aki's request to "finish
 his interrogatories."
 
On April 6, 2007, Aki filed her "Second Request to
 
[Hirokazu] for Production of Documents" (Second Request for
Documents). On June 4, 2007, Hirokazu responded by filing his
 
"Motion for Protective Order Against [Aki's] Second Request for
 
Production of Documents Dated April 6, 2007" (June Motion for
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Protective Order). Hirokazu argued that the information which
 
Aki requested "is well beyond general information to determine
 
the disbursement of assets" and is akin to a "fishing expedition"
 into Hirokazu's financial situation. "With the exception of a
 one-third (1/3) interest in [sic] Japanese Partnership named
 'Asset Gain'," Hirokazu objected to Aki's request to provide
 information relating to assets that he did not own and rather
 belonged to his mother, Shizume Nakajima (Shizume). "In this
 
regard, [Hirokazu sought] a protective order barring and
 
preventing any and all disclosure to [Aki] regarding assets that
 are not personally his." Hirokazu denied that requested
 materials were within his possession and control Hirokazu argued,
 "issues as to property division should be confined to the
 parties' assets and liabilities as set forth in their respective
 financial statements." Aki filed a cross-motion to compel
 discovery on August 20, 2007.
 
On September 19, 2007, the family court held a hearing
 
on Hirokazu's Motion for a Protective Order. Hirokazu introduced
 a copy of an agreement dated August 16, 2004, which allegedly
 transferred Hirokazu's stock ownership of Avalon Cove (Exhibit
 1). Aki's counsel, Otsuka, asked why Hirokazu could produce the
 "transfer of stocks" for the hearing but could not do so for
 Aki's Second Request for Production of Documents. Otsuka further
 contended Hirokazu's assertion that he had no control over Avalon
 Cove's documentation was inconsistent with paragraph 9 of his
 affidavit, which stated, "I received reports regarding the status
 of Avalon Cove so I would be able to help my mother as she is not
 receiving sufficient income and needs financial assistance." 
Otsuka also represented Japanese law as requiring actual transfer
 of stock certificates and therefore documentation of a transfer
 of stocks constitutes "only circumstantial evidence of any
 transfer of stocks."
 
Okimoto noted that Otsuka referred to statements
 
Hirokazu wrote in his book and contended Hirokazu used "literary
 license" such that his written statements in that book were not
 necessarily accurate. The family court stated it would deny
 Hirokazu's motion for a protective order and would grant the
 
5
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
motion to compel protection of documents "even though [Okimoto
 
is] saying this is not in [Hirokazu's] control . . . because
 there is [sic] some kind of documents that he can at least get,
 if not from the corporation, from other family members or his own
 records, like gift tax payments, his salary, the tax payments,
 2005 tax payments, . . . passbook statements, withholding
 statements, the property tax assessment[.]"
 
On October 5, 2007, the family court granted Aki's
 
cross-motion to compel discovery and ordered Hirokazu to produce
 all documents requested in Aki's Second Request for Production of
 Documents. The family court also issued an order denying
 Hirokazu's June Motion for Protective Order.
 
On December 6, 2007, Hirokazu filed another "Motion for
 
Protective Order Against [Aki's] Second Request for Production of
 Documents Dated April 6, 2007" (December Motion for Protective
 
Order) seeking protection from Aki's request of production of
 
financial documents and materials relating to Avalon Cove. 
Hirokazu alleged that his mother, Shizume, the owner of Avalon
 Cove, wrote him a letter dated October 10, 2007 in which she
 stated she would not provide the requested documents to him. The
 translation of the letter Hirokazu provided stated in pertinent
 part: 
I cannot agree with your request that documents and
financial statements of Avalon Cove be given to you for thepurpose of your divorce. The share holder of [Avalon Cove]is me . . . . I bought it from you before you got married toAki. You are no longer the owner of Avalon Cove. I will not agree to provide any of the documents and statementsbecause they are personal to me. I am concerned that if I give you papers regarding my Avalon Cove they will be usedfor no good purpose and I will be damaged. Now Avalon Cove has absolutely nothing to do with you and your divorceprocedure in [Hawai' i]. My property is entirely nothing to
do with the distribution of your property. 
Please understand. 
On December 17, 2007, Aki filed a "Motion for Civil 
Sanctions Under [Hawai 'i Family Court Rules (HFCR)] Rule 37" 
against Hirokazu for willfully failing to comply with the family 
court's October 5, 2007 "Order Granting Defendant/Cross-Plaintiff Aki Nakajima's Cross-Motion to Compel Discovery, filed 8/20/07." In his declaration supporting the motion for civil sanctions, 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Otsuka stated that a public record from the Japanese Ministry of
 
Justice dated March 20, 2007 indicated Hirokazu had been
 reappointed as director of Avalon Cove on October 17, 2005
 (Exhibit C) and noted Hirokazu had represented the alleged sale
 of Avalon Cove to Shizume as having occurred on August 16, 2004.
 
Aki received a document dated January 3, 2008 titled,
 
"[Hirokazu's] Second Amended Responses to [Aki's] Second Request
 for Production of Documents dated April 6, 2007."
 
On January 15, 2008, the family court entered its
 
"Order (RE: Hearings on 1) Plaintiff's Motion for Protective
 Order Against Defendant's Second Request for Production of
 Documents Dated April 6, 2007 filed 12/6/07; 2) Defendant/Cross-
Plaintiff Aki Nakajima's Motion for Civil Sanctions Under HFCR
 Rule 37 Filed 12/17/07; 3) Defendant/Cross-Plaintiff Aki
 Nakajima's Motion to Continue Trial Filed 12/17/07; And 4) Other
 Matters)" (January Discovery Order). The family court denied
 
Hirokazu's December Motion for Protective Order "because the
 
alleged letter from [Shizume] is insufficient to show compliance"
 with its order granting Aki's motion to compel discovery. The
 family court also ordered Hirokazu to produce his 2005 and 2006
 U.S. income tax returns within 14 days of the hearing. The
 family court continued Aki's motion for civil sanctions and her
 Pre-decree Motion for Relief, filed on December 31, 2007 (Pre­
decree Motion) for hearing on March 13, 2008, and provided
 
Hirokazu two more weeks from the date of its January 8, 2008
 
hearing to comply with its order to produce documents in response
 to Aki's Second Request for Production of Documents.
 
Aki served a third request for production of documents
 
on Hirokazu on February 22, 2008. Hirokazu's 2004 U.S. income
 tax return disclosed an income of $13,540. Nine days later Aki
 again filed a motion to compel discovery because Hirokazu had
 failed to produce all that was requested.
 
On February 27, 2008, Aki filed a "Motion to Determine
 
Foreign Law as to Alleged Sale of Stocks" (Motion to Determine
 
Foreign Law) wherein she moved the family court "for an order
 
determining that under Japanese law, as a matter of law,
 
[Hirokazu had] failed to show that the stocks he held for [Avalon
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Cove], were transferred to his mother, [Shizume], because the
 
alleged transfer [did] not comply with Article 128(1) of the
 Companies Act (Japanese law)." 
On March 10, 2008, Aki filed a translation of her
 
declaration in support of her Pre-decree Motion. Aki declared
 Hirokazu had inflicted physical abuse upon her in November 2005,
 
5
a TRO was issued,  and she moved out of the marital home because
she was not authorized to work in the U.S. until her immigration
 petition under the Violence Aginst Women Act was approved and she
 received an "Employment Authorization Card." Aki stated that she
 did not believe that Hirokazu had no income from Japan because
 this was contrary to what he had told her.
 
On March 13, 2008, the family court held a hearing on
 
Hirokazu's motion for protective order against Aki's Second
 Request for Production of Documents, motion for civil sanctions,
 Predecree Motion, and Motion to Determine Foreign Law. Hirokazu
 agreed to turn over "whatever records and files [he had] and have
 them translated" in fourteen days (March 28, 2008) and based on
 that agreement, Aki moved to withdraw her motion to compel. 
On April 25, 2008, Hirokazu filed a notice of intent to
 
offer and utilize a document represented as the parties
 premarital agreement, dated November 10, 2004 and written
 entirely in Japanese. 
On May 2, 2008, the family court entered an order
 
entitled "Order (re: Hearings on[:] 1) Defendant/Cross-Plaintiff
 Aki Nakajima's Motion for Civil Sanctions Under HFCR Rule 37
 Filed 12/17/07; 2)Defendant/Cross-Plaintiff Aki Nakajima's Motion
 to Compel Discovery Filed on 2/27/28; 3) Defendant/Cross-
Plaintiff Aki Nakajima's Motion [to] Determine Foreign Law As To
 Alleged Sale of Stocks Filed 2/27/08; 4) Defendant/Cross-
Plaintiff Aki Nakajima's Motion and Affidavit for Pre-Decree
 Relief Filed 12/31/08; and 5) Other Matters)" (May Discovery
Order). The family court continued Aki's motion for civil
 
sanctions until trial, but ordered Hirokazu for a third time to
 
5
 On May 6, 2008 Hirokazu testified that, in 2005, Aki hit his cheek
and he told her that he would hit her and "didn't hit her very hard." He
 
denied hitting her again on October 8, 2005.
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
produce the documents requested by March 28, 2008. As to Aki's
 
motion to compel discovery, the family court noted that Aki was
 withdrawing this motion without prejudice based on Hirokazu's
 counsel's representation that he will produce all of the
 requested documents and information by March 28, 2008. The
 family court took Aki's motion for determining foreign law under
 advisement.
 
Also on May 2, 2008, Aki filed a motion in limine to
 
exclude the parties' alleged prenuptial agreement.
 
On May 6, 2008 and June 3, 2008, the family court held 
a trial. At the May 6, 2008 trial, Masako Yamaguchi (Yamaguchi) 
served as Aki's translator. Yamaguchi declared she was a 
professional translator and a registered court interpreter with the Hawai
'i State Judiciary. 
During his cross-examination on May 6, 2008, Otsuka
 
asked Hirokazu to translate Exhibit NNN, which consisted of
 excerpts from Exhibit GGG. Hirokazu denied the document said,
 "stock certificate" and that it said "certificate of all
 registered items." Hirokazu testified the translation "stock
 certificate" was not correct.
 
On June 4, 2008, both parties filed exhibit lists.
 On June 24, 2008, the family court entered a divorce
 
decree (1) dissolving the marriage between Hirokazu and Aki; (2)
 recognizing that the couple had no children born of the marriage;
 (3) awarding no spousal support, but acknowledging Hirokazu's
 binding promise to pay reasonable attorney's fees and costs
 incurred in legitimating Aki's immigration status and obtaining
 and renewing her Employment Authorization Card; and (4) dividing
 and distributing their property and debt. The family court
 acknowledged that Hirokazu has an annuity and retirement account
 at Nationwide, Oppenheimer Funds, and Ameritrade.
 
The divorce decree states, "[t]here are no jointly
 
owned securities. Each is awarded the securities held solely in
 their separate names. [Hirokazu's] American Express portfolio is
 awarded to [Hirokazu] as his sole and separate property." It
 also states Hirokazu had an annuity or retirement account at
 Nationwide, Oppenheimer Funds, and Ameritrade and awarded
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hirokazu's retirement account and annuities as his sole and
 
separate property. Hirokazu's retirement benefits, however, were
 marital property subject to equitable division and Aki is
 entitled to her share of Hirokazu's retirement benefits. 
Regarding Avalon Cove, the family court awarded Aki
 
"her martial partnership share of the increase in value of
 [Hirokazu's] interest in [Avalon Cove], from the date of marriage
 to the end of the trial." The family court further ordered:
 
If the parties cannot reach an agreement as to a
determination of that value, based upon [Hirokazu's] claim
that in 2004, Avalon Cove's value was $100,000.00, this
amount shall be the starting value. The current value of
 the stocks shall be determined by an appraiser to asses
[sic] the current market price of the Setagya and Meguro
properties. If the revised stockholder equity amount is
greater than $100,000.00, [Aki] shall have half of the
increased amount as equalization payment. (If the parties
cannot reach an agreement as to an appraiser, each party may
each submit three proposed Japanese real estate appraisers
for [the family] court's selection within two weeks from the
decree. [Hirokazu] shall pay the appraisal costs.)
 
The family court awarded Hirokazu's books to Hirokazu
 
as his sole and separate property and ordered that post-divorce
 
royalties and liabilities for these books would be evenly
 divided.
 
On July 7, 2008, Hirokazu filed a "Motion for
 
Clarification of Divorce Decree Entered On June 24, 2008," 
pursuant to HFCR 60(b)(1).
6 Hirokazu sought clarification "as to
 
the enumeration of Ameritrade as an annuity or retirement
 account" because "the Ameritrade account indicates that it is a
 securities account." Noting that the divorce decree stated "the
 current value of the [Avalon Cove] stocks shall be determined by
 an appraiser to assess the current market price of Setagya and
 Meguro properties," Hirokazu sought clarification as to the net
 current value of the properties and argued that this value should
 include any existing debt including the mortgage balances as of
 the end of the trial. Hirokazu also sought clarification of the
 family court's award of his books as his "sole and separate
 
6
 HFCR Rule 60(b)(1), "Relief From Judgment or Order," allows for
relief "[o]n motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a
party . . . from any or all of the provisions of a final judgment, order or
proceeding for . . . mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect[.]"
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
property" and argued that post-divorce royalties from those books
 
should likewise be his separate property.
 
In his "Supplemental Declaration of Counsel In Support
 
Of Plaintiff's Motion For Clarification Of Divorce Decree Entered
 On June 24, 2008 Filed on July 7, 2008," Hirokazu requested an
 evidentiary hearing where the parties could submit evidence in
 the form of testimony and exhibits to determine the value of
 Avalon Cove measured by either the book value or the fair market
 value, but not both.
 
On July 8, 2008, the family court entered the "Order
 
Granting Award of Alimoney [sic] and Attorneys Fees And Costs"
 (Order Granting Fees and Costs) awarding Aki $14,817.55 in
 
attorney's fees and costs at Hirokazu's expense. The family
 
court specified that $5,885.06 out of $14,817.55 was awarded to
 Aki to pay for her immigration processing.
7 The other $8,932.49
 
was awarded to Aki for the reasonable costs and attorney's fees
 associated with her August 20, 2007 motion to compel discovery,
 her December 17, 2007 motion for civil sanctions, and her Motion
 to Determine Foreign Law.
 
On July 16, 2008, the family court entered the "Order

 
Selecting Real Estate Appraiser" (Order re Appraiser), to assist
 
in the valuation of the assets of Avalon Cove and ordering
 
Hirokazu to pay the appraisal costs. By letter dated July 16,
 2008, Aki's counsel submitted an invoice of 650,000 yen for the
 appraisal fee.
 
On August 12, 2008, Aki filed an "Ex-Parte Motion for
 
Issuance of Garnishee Summons After Judgment," requesting
 garnishment of Hirokazu's accounts because he had failed to pay
 the appraisal fee. On the same day, the family court issued an
 order for the issuance of a garnishee summons against Hirokazu.
 
On September 8, 2008, Aki filed her position statement
 
on Hirokazu's motion for clarification of divorce decree with the
 
7
 During the marriage, Hirokazu promised he would sponsor Aki's
immigration to the United States, but amid the divorce proceedings Aki
incurred $5,885.06 in attorney fees and costs to legitimize her immigration
status. Aki also incurred expenses relating to obtaining and renewing her
Employment Authorization Card.
 
11
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appraiser's report on the two Avalon Cove properties, and the
 
"Avalon Cove's Book Records," Hirokazu's Exhibit 37, attached. 
Aki pointed out Hirokazu's Exhibit 37 took the position that
 stockholder equity in Avalon Cove at that time of the divorce was
 6,032,116 yen or $60,321. The appraiser, however, assessed the
 present market value of both Avalon Cove properties and the
 stockholder equity figures were adjusted from 6,032,116 yen
 ($60,321) to 98,618,749 yen ($986,187.49). Because the divorce
 decree found Hirokazu's equity in Avalon Cove at the time of
 marriage was 10,00,000 yen ($100,000), Aki calculated her
 equalization payment to be $443,094. Aki stated Hirokazu's
 position that "Ameritrade are stock accounts in nature rather
 than retirement funds" was correct and noted the Ameritrade
 account may have been confused with the Ameriprise account. Aki,
 however, urged the family court to notice that the Ameritrade
 account had not been disclosed until Hirokazu's last asset and
 debt statement and to award it to Aki as a sanction.
 
On October 1, 2008, Hirokazu's counsel, Okimoto, filed
 
a "Supplemental Declaration of Counsel in Support of [Hirokazu's]
 Motion for Clarification of Divorce Decree Entered on June 24,
 2008, filed on July 7, 2008." In his supplemental declaration,
 Okimoto declared Hirokazu requests the family court set an
 evidentiary hearing with regard to valuation of Hirokazu's
 interest in Avalon Cove from the date of marriage until the
 issuance of the divorce decree.
 
On October 8, 2008, the family court held a hearing on
 
Hirokazu's June 24, 2008 motion for clarification. Okimoto noted
 the family court selected an appraiser suggested by Aki and that
 the cost of the appraiser as represented to the family court
 would be 6,000 yen. Okimoto stated the appraiser had submitted a
 bill for 650,000 yen. Otsuka admitted to having made a
 typographical error in regard to the appraiser's fee, which was
 supposed to be $6,000 instead of 6000 yen (6000 yen is $60.00).

Otsuka represented $6,000 to be a reasonable appraiser's fee.

 The parties stipulated to a currency conversion rate of $1=100
yen.
 
12
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The family court denied Hirokazu's oral motion to revise the
 
appraiser selection process and his oppositions to garnishment
 orders. In regard to Hirokazu's motion to clarify that the
 Ameritrade account was a securities and not a retirement account,
 the family court stated: 
[Family Court]: Yeah, I was basing, if I remember
correctly, and it's been a while since we had trial, but it
was based on your client's own exhibit. 
He said these were
 
retirement accounts, you know. I think that was his own
 
exhibit.
 
[Okimoto]: It is not a retirement account.
 
[Family Court]:
 But that's what his exhibit
 
essentially showed.
 
[Hirokazu]: No, that's not right.
 
[Otsuka]: Now it's clarified, your Honor.
 [Family Court]: So, in any event, I'm denying your
motion and I'm going to ask [Aki's counsel] to prepare the

order from today's ruling.
 
On November 19, 2008, the family court entered a
 
garnishment order regarding the $6,012.11 appraisal fee that
 
Hirokazu had failed to pay.
 
On November 26, 2008, the family court entered "Order
 
(re: Hearing on Plaintiff's Motion for Clarification of Divorce

 
Decree Entered on June 24, 2008 Filed on July 7, 2008, and Other
 
 9
Matters)" (November Order Re Motion for Clarification).  The
 
family court found: 
Exhibit 37, submitted by HIROKAZU at trial as the
alleged value of Avalon Cove is not in agreement with the
Supplemental Declaration of Counsel filed October 1, 2008.
In the Supplemental Declaration of Counsel, HIROKAZU's
counsel implied that Exhibit 37 may be merely a book value
of Avalon Cove. If this is true, it is in conflict with
HIROKAZU's initial position that the alleged $100,000 stock
sale to his mother was a legitimate transaction. This would
 imply that the alleged stock sale approximated the book
value and not the fair market value, impeaching HIROKAZU's
own statement that the transaction was legitimate. The
 doctrine of quasi-estoppel prohibits the reconsideration of
the value of Avalon Cove at the time of marriage.
 
The family court found no due process violation in
 
determining the value of the Avalon Cove properties without an
 
evidentiary hearing because the family court's valuation method
 
9
 This motion hearing was continued multiple times.
 
13
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
reflected sanctions against Hirokazu for concealing his assets. 
The family court found the misstatement of the currency of the
 estimated appraisal fee to be immaterial and refused to set aside
 the substance of the appraisal report. Hirokazu was ordered to
 pay Aki $443,094 in equalization payments for Avalon Cove. The
 family court also denied Hirokazu's motion for clarification of:
 (1) the equity value of Avalon Cove because Aki's position was
 also that the mortgage balance can be included in the calculation
 of that equity value; (2) the Ameritrade issue, because the
 family court's ruling was based on Hirokazu's own position; and
 (3) the Ascom book copyright and royalties issue. 
On December 26, 2008, Hirokazu filed a notice of appeal
 
from the following documents:
 
(1) the "Order Denying Plaintiff's Motion For
 Protective Order Against Defendant's Second
 Request To Plaintiff For Production of Documents
 Dated April 6, 2007, Filed 6/4/07," filed October
 5, 2007;
 
(2) the January Discovery Order;
 
(3) the May Discovery Order;
 
(4) the "Decree Granting Absolute Divorce," filed on
 June 24, 2008;
 
(5) the Order Granting Fees and Costs;
 
(6) the Order re Appraiser;
 
(7) the "Order Granting Ex Parte Motion For Issuance
 Of Garnishee Summons After Judgment"; "Garnishee

 Judgment; Garnishee Summons and Order; Garnishee

(8) the "Garnishment Order," filed November 19, 2008;
 and
 
(9) the November Order Re Motion for Clarification.
 
On December 29, 2008, the family court entered a
 
14
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
supplemental decree reiterating Hirokazu's obligation to pay
 
attorney's fees and costs in the amount of $14,817.55 to Aki and
 thus a total of $457,911.55 to Aki, inclusive of her part of the
 division and distribution of the parties' interests. 
On January 5, 2009, Hirokazu filed his request for
 
entry of findings of fact and conclusions of law.
 
On January 14, 2009, Hirokazu filed an amended notice
 
of appeal in which he appeals the nine documents listed supra in
 
his December 26, 2008 notice of appeal as well as the family
 court's December 29, 2008 supplemental decree. 
On January 23, 2009, Hirokazu filed a motion to stay
 
pending appeal the family court's various orders regarding
 payment of alimony, attorney's fees and costs.
 
On February 3, 2009, the family court filed its
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law (COLs). Pertinent FOFs,
 
including those Hirokazu contests on appeal, are as follows: 

 
26. There was evidence of numerous violation [sic] of
the financial restraining order dated June 22, 2006 by
[Hirokazu]. They include substantively reducing the account
at Citibank, Japan (Ex. 52); closing of his bank account at
Mitsui-Sumitomo Bank (Ex "3"); selling his Mercedes M1320
and 1995 Yamaha Wave Runner; closing Ameriprise account (Ex

6-18 and 6-17 entries).
 
27. There was evidence of numerous nondisclosure
 
and/or misrepresentation in the previous asset and debt
statements of [Hirokazu]. There was the nondisclosure of
 Ameritrade account. Ex "11" & "Q". This account was opened
during marriage. Ex 52. However, this account was not
disclosed in the prior asset and debt statement. Ex. "CCC",
"DDD", "EEE".

 marriage. Ex 52. This account was not disclosed in the
 prior asset and debt statement. Ex. "CCC", "DDD", "EEE".
Nor was this disclosed in the interrogatories. Ex "H". In
 
violation of the financial retraining [sic] order,
[Hirokazu] depleted all the monies in this account. Ex
 "52". 
29. There was also the nondisclosure of Prego Share.
[Hirokazu] invested in Prego Shares. Ex "17" and "T". 
Husband claims he was deceived (Ex 52), but there is no
evidence he filed a lawsuit in Japan. Furthermore, this
account was not disclosed in the prior asset and debt
statement. Ex "CCC", "DDD", "EEE". Nor was this disclosed
 in the interrogatories. Ex "H". 
30. There was also the nondisclosure of Gaitame.com. 
15
  
 
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
[Hirokazu] has a foreign exchange account at Gaitame.com. 
Ex "23" and "U". This account was not disclosed in the
 prior asset and debt statement. Ex "CCC", "DDD", "EEE".
Nor was this disclosed in the interrogatories. Ex "H". 
31. There was also the nondisclosure of interest in
 
Asset Gain. Admittedly, [Hirokazu] invested $10,000 in
Asset Gain. Ex 52. [Hirokazu] did not disclose this
information about his Asset Gain stock in his asset and debt
 statements. Exs "CCC", "DDD", "EEE".
 
32. There was also the nondisclosure of [Hirokazu's]
account receivable from Avalon Cove of $45,000. Ex 37. 
However, this was never disclosed in [Hirokazu's] previous
asset and debt statements. Exs "CCC", "DDD", "EEE". 
33. There was also nondisclosure of [Hirokazu's]
Receivable from Ohta. [Hirokazu] had accounts receivable in

not disclose the accounts receivable in his asset and debt
 statements. Exs "CCC", "DDD", "EEE". 
34. There was also nondisclosure of intellectual
 
property rights. [Hirokazu] did not disclose information
about the copyrights and royalty rights from [Ascom] in his
asset and debt statement. Ex "CCC", "DDD", "EEE". 
35. Finally, there was nondisclosure of [Hirokazu's]
business interest in a company called Avalon Cove. 
36. Plaintiff alleged that [Hirokazu] sold to his
mother 200 stocks of Avalon Cove, Inc. for 10,000,000 yen
($100,000) and denied that they were marital assets.
Exhibit 36. 
37. However, there is not even a signature of
[Hirokazu] or his mother, the parties involved in this
alleged agreement. Id.
 
38. In Japan, formally written contracts are usually
signed and sealed. Aki testimony. 
. . . .
 
41. This [family] court does not find any evidence of
delivery of the stocks by [Hirokazu] to his mother. In
 
fact, [Hirokazu] denies delivery of the stock. 
42. The [family] court does not find any evidence of
monies paid by [Hirokazu] to his mother for the stock from
[Hirokazu's] account. The Court finds that [Hirokazu's]
claim that there was a setoff not credible. 
43. The [family] court finds that [Hirokazu] has made
representation [sic] to the public in Japan that Avalon Cove
is his. [Hirokazu] stated that his present income of
30,000,000 (Approx. $300,000) mostly comes from rent
payments he receives from the real estates [sic] he owns in
Japan. Ex "PPP." 
44. [Hirokazu] argues that all of his statements were
lies to the public to promote his books. [Family] court
finds that [Hirokazu's] argument is not credible.

46. According to the appraisal reports issued by
Katsuhiro Miyata, the present value of the Meguro Property
(1-554-4 Megurohoncho, Meguro-ku, Tokyo Japan) is
176,017,000 yen and the Setagaya Property (5-14-26 Kamiuma,
Setagaya-Ku, Tokyo Japan) is 153,640,000 yen totaling
329,657,000 yen. Exhibits "B"-"E" attached to [Aki's]
Position Statement as to [Hirokazu's] Motion for
Clarification of Divorce Decree Entered on June 24, 2008,
filed September 8, 2008. 
47. At the time of the divorce, [Hirokazu] submitted
Exhibit 37 and took the position that the two properties
owned by Avalon Cove were worth 237,070.367 [sic] yen (Fixed
Assets), that the Total Assets of Avalon Cove was
240,932,957 yen, and that Avalon Cove had debts in the
amount of 240,392,957 yen, so that the Stockholder's Equity
was 6,032,116 yen. 
48. Using the appraised market value of the two real
estate properties owned by Avalon Cove, the Fixed Assets
value was adjusted upward from 237,070,367 yen to
329,657,000 yen. Thus the Total Assets figure was adjusted
from 240,932,957 yen to 332,972,590 yen. The Total
 Liability & Equity was adjusted from 240,932,957 yen to
332,972,590 yen because a balance sheet must balance. The
 Total Liability was subtracted and the Stock Holder's Equity
figures were adjusted from 6,032,116 yen to 98,618,749 yen.
The [family court] finds that 98,618,749 yen or $986,187 to
be the stock value of Avalon Cove at the time of divorce. 
49. In connection with the alleged stock transfer to
[Hirokazu's] mother on August 16, 2004, [Hirokazu] had
alleged that he sold his mother 200 stocks of Avalon Cove,
Inc. for 10,000,000 yen ($100,000). Exhibit 36.
 
50. This Court find [sic] [Hirokazu's] allegation to
be an admission that the Stockholder's Equity value of
Avalon Cove, Inc. was 10,000,000 yen ($100,000) at the time
of marriage.
 
. . . .
 
52. [Aki] incurred [$8,932.49] in reasonable and
necessary attorney fees and costs related to discovery of
[Hirokazu's] complete assets including information regarding
Avalon cove in the following motions:
 
A. [Aki's] Motion for Civil Sanctions Under [HRCP], Rule 37
 
filed December 17, 2007.
 B. [Aki's] Cross-Motion to Compel Discovery, filed August
20, 2007.
 C. [Aki's] Motion to Determine Foreign Law as to Alleged
 
Sale of Stock, filed February 27, 2008. 
53. [Aki] incurred SIX HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND
(650,000) Yen in appraisal fees charged by Katsuhiro Miyata.
The currency exchange rate as of August 6, 2008 was
$1=108.11 Yen. Thus, [Aki] incurred SIX THOUSAND AND TWELVE AND
11/100 Dollars ($6,012.11) in reasonable and necessary appraisal
fees. 
The family court also issued the following COLs
pertinent to the division of property and equalization payments
 
 
17

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
from Hirokazu to Aki: 
III. Conclusions of Law
 
. . . .
 
14. In accordance with all of the foregoing, a
divorce decree providing as follows shall therefore
enter:
 
. . . .
 C. PROPERTY DIVISION. All of the property of the
parties not specifically distributed elsewhere in this Decree
shall be distributed as follows:
 
. . . .
 
7. Avalon Cove Inc. Stocks. [Aki] is Awarded
her marital partnership share of the increase in value of
[Hirokazu's] interest in Avalon Cove, Inc. from the date of the
marriage to the end of the trial. Based upon [Hirokazu]'s claim
in 2004, Avalon Cove's value was $100,000.00, this amount shall be
the starting value. As sanctions for hiding assets, [Hirokazu] is
prohibited from introducing appraised value of the properties.
Based on the appraisal report, the current market price of the
Setag[a]ya and Meguro properties is $3,329,796. Using
[Hirokazu's] balance sheet (Ex 32), the adjusted current value of
the stocks is $986,187. [Aki] shall have half of the increased
amount ($886,187) as an equalization payment, i.e. FOUR HUNDRED
FORTY THREE THOUSAND AND NINETY FOUR AND NO/100 Dollars
($443,094). [Hirokazu] shall pay [the real estate appraiser's]
reasonable and necessary appraisal fees in the amount of SIX
THOUSAND TWELVE AND 11/100 Dollars. ($6,012.11
). 
On February 22, 2013, this court filed its "Order
 
Dismissing Appeal" on the basis that it lacked jurisdiction over
 
the ten family court orders. On March 4, 2013, Hirokazu filed
 his "Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant-Appellant's Motion for
 Reconsideration of the Court's Order Dismissing Appeal, filed on
 February 22, 2013." On March 8, 2013, this court filed its
 "Order Denying 'Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant-Appellant's Motion for
 Reconsideration of the Court's Order Dismissing Appeal, filed on
 February 22, 2013.'"
 
On April 9, 2013 Hirokazu filed his application for
 
writ of certiorari, which the Hawai
'i Supreme Court accepted on 
May 21, 2013.
 
On February 13, 2014, the supreme court filed its
"Order Vacating Intermediate Court of Appeals' Order Dismissing
 Appeal and Remanding Appeal to ICA." The supreme court
 determined that this court had jurisdiction over Hirokazu's
 appeal and vacated this court's "Order Dismissing Appeal," filed
 

 
18

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
on February 22, 2013.
 
On May 9, 2014, this court filed a memorandum opinion,
 
which reviewed the family court's November Order Re Motion for
 
Clarification. This court interpreted the supreme court's
 February 13, 2014 remand order as providing that this court had
 "jurisdiction only over Hirokazu's appeal from the November Order
 Re Motion for Clarification pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes
(HRS) § 571–54 (2006 Repl.)" Therefore this court declined "to
 
address Hirokazu's points on appeal numbered 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11
 
and 12 because some address subject matter that falls outside of
 the family court's November Order Re Motion for Clarification,
 and Hirokazu fails to provide argument in support of the
 remaining." This court addressed points on appeal numbered 1, 2,
 3, 4, and 9.
 
On May 27, 2014, this court filed an order denying 
Hirokazu's motion for reconsideration of the May 9, 2014 memorandum opinion. On June 13, 2014, this court filed its judgment on appeal. On June 26, 2014, Hirokazu filed an application for writ of certiorari to the Hawai
'i Supreme Court. 
On August 7, 2014, the supreme court filed its order
 
accepting Hirokazu's application for writ of certiorari, which
 stated this court had "misconstrued" the February 13, 2014 order
 and "erroneously concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to address
 Hirokazu's points on appeal numbers 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, and 12" but
 correctly held that Hirokazu's point on appeal number 8 fell
 outside jurisdictional boundaries. The supreme court vacated
 this court's June 13, 2014 judgment on appeal and remanded the
 appeal for disposition of remaining issues. The August 7, 2014
 order accepting Hirokazu's application for writ of certiorari
 further provided: "[t]he family court's sanctions in this case
 fell within the scope of its authority. Subject to the issues
 that the ICA must address on remand, the valuation and division
 of Avalon Cove did not constitute an abuse of discretion." 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
HFCR Rule 60(b)
 
The standard of review for the grant or denial of a
 
HFCR Rule 60(b) motion is whether there has been an abuse of
 
19
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
discretion. De Mello v. De Mello, 3 Haw. App. 165, 169, 646 P.2d
 
409, 412 (1982).
 
Under the abuse of discretion standard of review, the
appellate court is not authorized to disturb the family
court's decision unless (1) the family court disregarded
rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial
detriment of a party litigant; (2) the family court failed
to exercise its equitable discretion; or (3) the family
court's decision clearly exceeds the bounds of reason. 
Wong v. Wong, 87 Hawai 'i 475, 486, 960 P.2d 145, 156 (App. 1998) 
(brackets omitted) (quoting Bennett v. Bennett, 8 Haw. App. 415,
 
426, 807 P.2d 597, 603 (1991)).
 
Family Court's Exercise of Discretion
 
The family court possesses wide discretion in making
its decisions and those decisions will not be set aside
 
unless there is a manifest abuse of discretion. Under the
 abuse of discretion standard of review, the family court's
decision will not be disturbed unless the family court
disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the
substantial detriment of a party litigant and its decision
clearly exceeded the bounds of reason.
 
In re Doe, 77 Hawai 'i 109, 115, 883 P.2d 30, 36 (1994) (internal 
quotation marks, citations, brackets, and ellipsis omitted).
 
FOFs/COLs
 
FOFs are reviewed under the clearly erroneous
standard. A[n FOF] is clearly erroneous when (1) the record
lacks substantial evidence to support the finding or
determination, or (2) despite substantial evidence to
support the finding or determination, the appellate court is
left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake
 
has been made. 
 
Schiller v. Schiller, 120 Hawai 'i 283, 288, 205 P.3d 548, 553 
(App. 2009) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
 
A COL is not binding upon an appellate court and is
freely reviewable for its correctness. [An appellate] court
ordinarily reviews COLs under the right/wrong standard.
Thus, a COL that is supported by the trial court's FOFs and
that reflects an application of the correct rule of law will
not be overturned. However, a COL that presents mixed
questions of fact and law is reviewed under the clearly
erroneous standard because the court's conclusions are
 dependent upon the facts and circumstances of each
individual case.

III. DISCUSSION
 
A. Points on Appeal Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9
 
For reasons described in this court's May 9, 2014
 
memorandum opinion, we decline to find the family court
 
reversibly erred in regard to Hirokazu's points on appeal
 numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9.
 
B.	 Points Number 5 and 6: allowing translator's
testimony and FOF 40 did not constitute reversible
error.
 
Hirokazu contends the family court erred by allowing
 
Aki's translator, Yamaguchi to testify and by admitting her
 
translations of Japanese language documents prepared after the
 May 6, 2008 trial. Hirokazu contends Yamaguchi "was filtering
 matters to be in line [sic] what she thought would benefit
 [Aki]." At trial, Hirokazu's counsel further objected to
 allowing Yamaguchi to testify because she was present throughout
 the entire proceedings. Aki's counsel explained that Yamaguchi
 was "not going to testify as to anything but the translation [of
 Exhibit GGG into Exhibit OOO]" and would verify the translation
 of Exhibit XX into Exhibit PPP. Hirokazu contends the family
 court allowed Aki to proceed with Yamaguchi's testimony in
 violation of Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 615 (1993). HRE
 
Rule 615 provides:
 
Rule 615 Exclusion of witnesses. At the request of a
party the court shall order witnesses excluded so that they
cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses, and it may
make the order of its own motion. This rule does not
 authorize exclusion of (1) a party who is a natural person,
or (2) an officer or employee of a party which is not a
natural person designated as its representative by its
attorney, or (3) a person whose presence is shown by a party
to be essential to the presentation of the party's cause.
 
Under HRE Rule 615, "[w]itnesses are generally excluded 
from trial to prevent the possibility that testimony might be 
'shaped' to match the testimony of other witnesses." State v. 
Culkin, 97 Hawai 'i 206, 231, 35 P.3d 233, 258 (2001) (citing 
Bloudell v. Wailuku Sugar Co., 4 Haw. App. 498, 504, 669 P.2d 163, 169 (1983)). Hirokazu does not indicate whether or how he requested the family court exclude Yamaguchi so that she could not hear other witnesses' testimony prior to the June 6, 2008 
21
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
trial or during proceedings in which she acted as an interpreter. 
As the family court acknowledged, Yamaguchi was present during
 the proceedings because "she was acting as an interpreter." 
The family court did not abuse its discretion in
 
permitting Yamaguchi to testify as to the accuracy of the English
 translations of Exhibit GGG, which was already stipulated as
 evidence in the May 6, 2008 trial, into Exhibit OOO.
 Hirokazu's point number 6 on appeal concerns Yamaguchi's
 testimony in which she affirmed that Exhibit FF contained a
 reference to the word "kabuken" and, when asked for the English
 translation of "kabuken," she said "the comment to the
 conversation say stock. But I am using that, you know, the stock
 certificate for the translation." Hirokazu's point on appeal is
 that the family court erred by finding: 
40. According [sic] the Avalon Cove registration with
the Japanese authorities, it states, "Effect of Rules
regarding issuance of stock certificates - The Corporation
issues stock certificates." Exhibit "GGG" and Exhibit
 
"OOO"[.]
 
According to Hirokazu, because Yamaguchi's testimony "should not
 
have been allowed[,]" no credible evidence supported the family
 court's FOF 40. Hirokazu further argues that Yamaguchi "changed
 her answer [to the question regarding the English translation of
 "kabuken"] to the one [Aki's counsel] wanted." At trial, the
 family court acknowledged Hirokazu's objections to Yamaguchi's
 translation of "kabuken" and noted that Hirokazu would be allowed
 to cross-examine Yamaguchi on this issue and determined it would
 allow Hirokazu to present rebuttal evidence or witnesses
 regarding ths translation. The family court heard Hirokazu deny
 that the document said, "stock certificate" and that instead it
 said "certificate of all registered items."
 
Hirokazu argues on appeal, "[c]learly, [Aki's]
 
translations were prepared by a witness who understood what her
 translations were to say based on her being present during the
 May 6, 2008 proceedings." He contends "[a]ll testimony of
 [Aki's] translator should be stricken pursuant to [HRE] Rule
 615[.]" His contention concerns the credibility of Yamaguchi's
 testimony and translations, which is a matter committed to the
 
22
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
family court's determination. The record contains evidence
 
supporting the family court's FOF 40 and this finding does not
 constitute clear error.
 
C.
	 Point 7: Denial of Hirokazu's request for a
protective order and imposition of sanctions for
failure to produce documents were within the
family court's discretion.
 
Hirokazu contends the family court was required to
 
"affirmatively find[]" he was able to obtain documents relating
 
to Avalon Cove in order to deny his Request for Protective Order
 for documents relating to Avalon Cove and further erred by
 awarding sanctions against him for failing to provide these
 documents. The extent to which the family court permitted
 discovery "is subject to considerable latitude" and discretion. 
Wakabayashi v. Hertz Corp. , 66 Haw. 265, 275, 660 P.2d 1309,
 
1315-16 (1983) (quoting In re Goodfader, 45 Haw. 317, 335, 367
 P.2d 472, 483 (1961)). We do not disturb the family court's
 discretion in permitting discovery absent "a clear abuse of
 discretion that results in substantial prejudice to a party." 
Wakabayashi, 66 Haw. at 275, 660 P.2d at 1316. Further, under
 
10
Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 26(c),  Hirokazu 
10	 HRCP Rule 26(c) provides:
 
(c) Protective Orders. Upon motion by a party or by
the person from whom discovery is sought, accompanied by a
certification that the movant has in good faith conferred or
attempted to confer with other affected parties in an effort
to resolve the dispute without court action, and for good
cause shown, the court in which the action is pending or
alternatively, on matters relating to a deposition, the
court in the circuit where the deposition is to be taken may
make any order which justice requires to protect a party or
person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue
burden or expense, including one or more of the following:
(1) that the disclosure or discovery not be had; (2) that
the disclosure or discovery may be had only on specified
terms and conditions, including a designation of the time or
place; (3) that the discovery may be had only by a method of
discovery other than that selected by the party seeking
discovery; (4) that certain matters not be inquired into, or
that the scope of the disclosure or discovery be limited to

carried the burden of showing "good cause" to support his motion
 
for protective order.
 
Hirokazu indicates no authority supporting his
 
contention that the family court was required to make certain
 affirmative findings in order to deny his motion for protective
 orders. Instead, Hirokazu relies on his and his counsel's
 representations to the family court that he was unable to procure
 the Avalon Cove documents in support of his contention that
 family court erred. Hirokazu notes that the family court did not
 find that he owned Avalon Cove. At the June 6, 2008 trial, the
 family court said, "I don't think that the [family court] can
 find he still owns Avalon Cove. I think he did transfer his
 interest to his mother." The family court continued, "But when
 that happened or how that happened, I think there is – [Otsuka] I
 know will probably argue that." It does not follow from this
 statement that the family court was unable to require Hirokazu to
 produce Avalon Cove documents.
 
At its September 19, 2007 hearing on Hirokazu's motion
 
for a protective order against Aki's second request for
 production of documents, the family court asked Aki's counsel,
 Otsuka, to respond to Hirokazu's argument that he has no control
 over the documents Aki requested. Otsuka responded "[Hirokazu]
 was receiving it then, and in his own admission, he is saying
 that he is receiving it right now." Hirokazu's counsel, Okimoto,
 argued that Hirokazu's statements in his published book were not
 under oath and should not be considered "admission[s]." Otsuka
 further contended that Hirokazu's assertion that he had no
 control over Avalon Cove's documentation was inconsistent with
 paragraph 9 of his affidavit, which stated, "I received reports
 regarding the status of Avalon Cove so I would be able to help my
 
10
 (...continued)
information enclosed in sealed envelopes to be opened as

directed by the court.
 
If the motion for a protective order is denied in
whole or in part, the court may, on such terms and
conditions as are just, order that any party or person
provide or permit discovery. The provisions of Rule 37(a)(4)
apply to the award of expenses incurred in relation to the
motion.
 
24
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
mother [as] she is not receiving sufficient income and needs
 
financial assistance." Aki further points out that Hirokazu was
 able to produce Exhibits 37, 38, and 39 (Avalon Cove's financial
 statements, board meeting agenda, and 2007 tax returns) and thus
 undermines his contention that he had no access to such
 documents.
 
The family court found "not credible" Hirokazu's
 
argument that "all of his statements were lies to the public to
 promote his books." The circuit court's decision to require
 Hirokazu to produce Avalon Cove documents and to deny his motion
 for a protective order did not constitute reversible error.
 
Hirokazu contends the family court could not sanction 
him "by awarding [Aki] attorney fees for filing of [Aki's] December 12, 2007 Motion for Civil Sanctions and Motion to Compel Discover [sic] filed August 20, 2007." Hirokazu cites no authority in support of this contention. Further, in its August 7, 2014 order accepting Hirokazu's application for writ of certiorari, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court made particular note that a 
court's "'inherent power to curb abuses and promote a fair process which extends to the preclusion of evidence and may include dismissal in severe circumstances'" applied to discovery sanctions. Nakajima v. Nakajima, 2014 WL 3880306 (Hawai
'i Aug. 
7. 2014) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). As the supreme court noted, "if the trial court has the inherent power to level the 'ultimate sanction' of dismissal, it necessarily has the power to take all reasonable steps short of dismissal, depending on the equities of the case[,]" (Id., quoting Kawamata Farms, Inc. v. United Agri Products, 86 Hawai
'i 
214, 242, 948 P.2d 1055, 1083 (1997) (emphasis added)) and concluded "[t]he family court's sanctions in this case fell within the scope of its authority." Id. There was no reversible 
error in the family court's imposition of sanctions against Hirokazu. 
D.	 Point 10: The family court's COLs based on
Japanese law did not constitute reversible error.
 
Hirokazu contends COLs 12 and 13 must be stricken
 
because Aki did not properly provide notice of foreign law and
 
25
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the family court did not find that foreign law and not Hawai 'i 
law would be applied. The family court's COLs 12 and 13 were as 
follows: 
12. Act 128 of Companies Act (Japanese law)
provides: 
Article 128 (Transfer of Shares in Company Issuing Share
Certificate)
 
(1) Transfer of shares in a Company Issuing Share
Certificate shall not become effective unless the shares
 certificates representing such share are delivered;
provided, however, that this shall not apply to transfer of
shares that arise out of the disposition of Treasury Shares. 
Companies Act, Article 128(1)
 
13. This Court concludes that under Japanese
law when stock certificates are issued, there must be
delivery of stocks for there to be effective transfer of
stocks. 
Hirokazu contends the family court's consideration of
 
Japanese law was in error because HRE Rule 202 and HRCP Rule 44.1
 
required Aki to provide him notice before the family court could
 take judicial notice of "the laws of foreign countries[.]" HRCP
 Rule 44.1 provides: 
Rule 44.1. DETERMINATION OF FOREIGN LAW.
 
A party who intends to raise an issue concerning the
law of a foreign country shall give notice by pleadings or
other reasonable written notice. The court, in determining
foreign law, may consider any relevant material or source,
including testimony, whether or not submitted by a party or
admissible under the [Hawaii] Rules of Evidence. The
 court's determination shall be treated as a ruling on a
question of law.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
Aki cited HRCP Rule 44.1 as the applicable standard in
 
her Motion to Determine Foreign Law wherein she moved the family
 
court "for an order determining that under Japanese law, as a
 matter of law, [Hirokazu] ha[d] failed to show that the stocks he
 held for Avalon Cove, Inc. were transferred to his mother,
 [Shizume], because the alleged transfer [did] not comply with
 Article 128(1) of the Companies Act (Japanese law)." Aki's
 pleading cited Act 128 of (Japan's) Companies Act, requiring the
 delivery of a share certificate to make a transfer effective,
 thus providing notice to Hirokazu in compliance with HRCP Rule
 
26
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
44.1. The family court's COL 13 was a finding that it was
 
applying Japanese law.
E.	 Point 11: The family court was not required to
issue a judgment for sums prior to its garnishment
order.
 
Hirokazu apparently contends the family court lacked
 
authority to issue its "garnishment order" and therefore FOF 53
 
is "clearly erroneous." FOF 53 provides: 
53. [Aki] incurred SIX HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND
(650,000) Yen in appraisal fees charged by Katsuhiro Miyata.
The currency exchange rate as of August 6, 2008 was
$1=108.11 Yen. Thus, [Aki] incurred SIX THOUSAND AND TWELVE
AND 11/100 Dollars ($6,012.11) in reasonable and necessary
appraisal fees.
 
11
A copy of HRS § 652-9 (1993),  was appended to the
family court's August 12, 2008 order for the issuance of a
 
garnishee summons against Hirokazu. Hirokazu contends
 requirements under HRS § 652-9 were not met because there was "no
 contract that [Hirokazu] pays [Aki] the appraisal costs."
 
"The primary purpose of a garnishment is to enforce the
 
payment of a judgment." Int'l Sav. & Loan Ass'n, Ltd. v. Wiig, 
 
82 Hawai 'i 197, 202, 921 P.2d 117, 122 (1996) (citing First Nat. 
Bank in Chester v. Conner, 485 S.W.2d 667, 671 (Mo. Ct. App.
 
11	 HRS § 652-9 provides:
 
§652-9 Garnishee may be heard on notice to plaintiff.
Whenever any person summoned as a garnishee may be desirous
of so doing, the person may apply to the district judge or
any judge of the court from which the summons may have
issued, and the judge having caused reasonable notice to be
given to the plaintiff in the action, shall proceed to take
the deposition of the person thus summoned, and make such
order as may be proper in the premises, at any time previous
to the date appointed for hearing the cause, and the person
summoned as garnishee, shall be taken to have obeyed the
summons. If it appears that there are conflicting claims to
any moneys held for safekeeping, debt, goods, or effects in
the garnishee's hands, any time after the summons is served
the garnishee may be permitted upon order of the judge to
pay into the court any moneys held for safekeeping, debts,
goods, or effects in the garnishee's hands, less any
reasonable costs and attorney's fees allowed by the judge
and the garnishee will thereupon be discharged. With or
without payment into court, any garnishee may, where there
are conflicting claims to any moneys held for safekeeping,
debt, goods, or effects in the garnishee's hands of any
amount, make application for an interpleader order and the
judge shall thereupon make all orders as appear to be just
and reasonable.

1972) ("a 'garnishment' is an ancillary remedy in aid of
 
execution to obtain payment of a judgment")). The August 12,
 2008 order for the issuance of a garnishee summons against
 Hirokazu was filed pursuant to the Divorce Decree, filed on June
 24, 2008, which required Hirokazu to pay all appraisal costs. 
The family court concluded that it had discretion under HRS
 § 580-47 (Supp. 2006) "to have one of the parties pay for
 Appraisal Fees and Attorney Fees." HRS § 580-47(a) provides: 
(a) Upon granting a divorce, or thereafter if, in addition
to the powers granted in subsections (c) and (d),
jurisdiction of those matters is reserved under the decree
by agreement of both parties or by order of court after
finding that good cause exists, the court may make any
further orders as shall appear just and equitable . . . (4)
allocating, as between the parties, the responsibility for
the payment of the debts of the parties whether community,
joint, or separate, and the attorney's fees, costs, and
expenses incurred by each party by reason of the divorce.
 
The family court acted within its discretion to grant
 
Aki's August 12, 2008 "Ex-Parte Motion for Issuance of Garnishee
 
Summons After Judgment," requesting garnishment of Hirokazu's
 accounts because he failed to pay the appraisal fee.
F.
	 Point 12: The family court did not clearly err by
entering FOFs 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34,
35, 36, 37, 41, 42, 43, 44 and 53.
 
Hirokazu contends FOF 2612 constitutes clear error
 
because "no evidence" established that reductions in account
 
balances and sales of marital property occurred after the June
 22, 2006 "Stipulation Re: Temporary Relief; Order". In support
 of his contention, he refers to his testimony that he had
 reduced, transferred, sold, and reduced properties prior to the
 financial restraining order, for necessary reasons such as having
 
12
 FOF 26 states:
 
26. There was evidence of numerous violation [sic] of
the financial restraining order dated June 22, 2006 by
[Hirokazu]. They include substantively reducing the account
at Citibank, Japan (Ex. 52); closing of his bank account at
Mitsui-Sumitomo Bank (Ex "3"); selling his Mercedes M1320
and 1995 Yamaha Wave Runner; closing Ameriprise account (Ex
"10" & "P["], "52"); closing E-Trade account. Ex "EEE" &
 52; and selling Asset Gain in June of 2007 for $40,000 in
violation of financial restraining order. Ex M (Heisei 19
6-18 and 6-17 entries).
 
28
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
his account "hacked[,]" in the course of prudent business
 
dealings, or for living expenses, as provided for in the June 22,
 2006 order. Hirokazu also testified that some reductions in his
 account balance occurred because he had been "swindled by a man
 [Aki] introduced" to him. Hirokazu's contention relies on his
 own testimony, while the family court's finding referred to
 exhibits 3, 10, 52, M, P, and EEE which, when taken together,
 constituted substantial evidence supporting the family court's
 finding that Hirokazu had violated the June 22, 2006 financial
 restraining order. We conclude FOF 26 does not constitute clear
 error.
 
Hirokazu conclusorily states that FOFs 27, 28, 29, 30,
 
31, 32, and 33 are clearly erroneous. In each of these FOFs,
 family court found there was "nondisclosure[,]" and Hirokazu
 acknowledges this to be true because he states that although he
 did not initially disclose them in his Asset and Debt statement,
 he did so eventually. The family court's FOFs are not clearly
 erroneous.
 
Hirokazu refers exclusively to his testimony as
 
evidence supporting his contentions that FOF 34, 35, 36, 37, and
 38 are clearly erroneous. The family court's FOF 34 was
 supported by Asset and Debt statement exhibits CCC, DDD, and EEE
 and therefore did not constitute clear error.
 
Hirokazu contends FOFs 35 and 36 are clearly erroneous
 
because he sold his Avalon Cove stocks to his mother. During
 family court proceedings, Hirokazu introduced a document that he
 represented to constitute evidence that he sold 200 stocks of
 Avalon Cove to his mother for 10,000,000 yen ($100,000) prior to
 the parties' marriage. Hirokazu conceded the transfer itself was
 disputed, but argues the date of his August 16, 2004 transfer of
 his interests in Avalon Cove pre-dated the parties' November 19,
 2004 marriage was not disputed and therefore the family court
 erred by finding Avalon Cove was marital property.
 
The family court found the "transfer" of Avalon Cove
 
stocks from Hirokazu to his mother was invalid because: (1)
 signatures and seals are required for valid formally written
 contracts under Japanese law and there were no signatures on the
 
29
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
alleged agreements between Hirokazu and his mother; (2) the
 
document was not a transfer of "stock certificates" as required
 under Japanese law; and (3) there was no evidence of delivery of
 the stock certificates to Hirokazu's mother which is also
 required under Japanese law for a valid stock transfer. Japan's
 "Companies Act" states, "[t]ransfer of shares in a Company
 Issuing Share Certificate shall not become effective unless the
 share certificates representing such shares are delivered[.]"
13
 
The Avalon Cove registration with the Japanese authorities
 states: "Effect of Rules regarding issuance of stock certificates
 -The Corporation issues stock certificates[.]" FOFs 35 and 36
 
are supported by the record and do not constitute clear error.
 
Hirokazu acknowledges that "[w]hile [FOF] 37 is
 
correct, it assumes there is something wrong with the lack of a
 signature of [Hirokazu] or his mother being present." Hirokazu
 does not articulate how alleged-assumptions in FOF 37 constitute
 clear error and we decline to find the family court erred. 
Hirokazu fails to cite to legal authorities or make persuasive
 arguments in support of his contentions that FOFs 37, 42, 43, and
 44 constitute clear error and does not mention FOF 41 at all. We
 can find no error.
 
Hirokazu conclusorily contends FOFs 46, 47, 48, 49, 50,
 
and 51 are clearly erroneous because "appraisal reports valuing
 the Meguro and Setagaya properties . . . are hearsay documents." 
Hirokazu cites no record, authorities, or evidence to support
 this contention and we find no error. 
Hirokazu contends FOF 52 is clearly erroneous in part
 
because he was not afforded notice as required under HRCP Rule
 44.1 that Aki would file her Motion to Determine Foreign Law. We
 rejected Hirokazu's claim based on HRCP Rule 44.1 supra. FOF
 52(C) required Hirokazu to pay Aki's attorney's fees incurred in
 
13
 Article 128 of the Companies Act under Japanese law states: "(1)
Transfer of shares in a Company Issuing Share Certificate shall not become
effective unless the share certificates representing such shares are
delivered; provided, however, that this shall not apply to transfer of shares
that arise out of the disposition of Treasury Shares." Companies Act, Act No.

filing three motions, including the Motion to Determine Foreign
 
Law. The family court had discretion to allocate to Hirokazu
 responsibility for attorney's fees and costs incurred "by each
 party by reason of the divorce." HRS § 580-47(a). Aki's Motion
 to Determine Foreign Law was filed by reason of the divorce
 proceedings. We find no error with the family court's FOF 52. 
Finally, we addressed, and rejected, Hirokazu's
 
contention that FOF 53 constitutes clear error supra.
