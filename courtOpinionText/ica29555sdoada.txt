NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
The Honorable Richard W. Pollack presided.  1NO. 29555
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
DIONE K. KAEO-TOMASELI, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CRIMINAL NO. 07-1-2163)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Nakamura, Chief Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Dione K. Kaeo-Tomaselli ( Kaeo-
Tomaselli ) appeals the Circuit Court of the First Circuit's
(Circuit Court's) Judgment of Conviction and Sentence entered on
December 1, 2008, convicting her of Methamphetamine Trafficking
in the Second Degree under Hawai# i Revised Statutes ( HRS) ยง 712-
1240.8 (Supp. 2008).1 
On appeal, Kaeo-Tomaselli contends the Circuit Court
erred in denying her motion to dismiss because certain phone
records that were lost/misplaced by the State were so critical to
the defense as to make the trial fundamentally unfair without
them.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Kaeo-Tomaselli's point of error as follows: 
In State v. Matafeo, 71 Haw. 183, 187, 787 P.2d 671,
673 (1990), the Hawai #i Supreme Court held that dismissal of
criminal charges is appropriate, regardless of good or bad faith
by the police, when the State loses or destroys material evidence
that is "so critical to the defense as to make a criminal trialNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2fundamentally unfair without it."  See also State v. Steger, 114
Hawai#i 162, 158 P.3d 280 (App. 2006).
In this case, the Circuit Court did not err in
concluding that the lost telephone records were not so critical
to the defense as to make a criminal trial fundamentally unfair.  
There was no evidence or reasonable inference that the phone
records necessarily would have been favorable to the defense. 
The Circuit Court emphasized that Kaeo-Tomaselli would not be
precluded from pursuing a relevant line of defense at trial in
the absence of the telephone records and Kaeo-Tomaselli had the
opportunity to extensively cross-examine the State's witnesses
regarding the telephone call that was alleged to have been made
and the absence of the telephone records to substantiate the
allegation.  Also, the Circuit Court's instruction permitting the
jury to infer that the information about the telephone call would
be favorable to Kaeo-Tomaselli eliminated any substantial
prejudice flowing from the absence of the telephone records. 
Applying the Matafeo standard to the record in this case, we
conclude that the absence of the phone records did not violate
Kaeo-Tomaselli's due process rights.
Accordingly we affirm the Circuit Court's December 1,
2008 Judgment of Conviction and Sentence.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, March 19, 2010.
