 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
ten years and thirty days, including a mandatory minimum term of
 
five years on Count 1. 
On appeal, Bailey asserts that: (1) the circuit court
 
erred by concluding that the State did not violate the witness
 
exclusion rule and by denying Bailey's motion to strike Officer
 
Kenneth Doyle's (Doyle) testimony; (2) the circuit court plainly
 
erred in admitting hearsay evidence in Exhibit 36; and (3) trial
 
counsel provided him ineffective assistance in failing to object
 
to the admission of Exhibit 36 and to the admission of testimony
 
and exhibits depicting pornography found in Bailey's vehicle.
 
As set forth below, we affirm.
 
I. Witness Exclusion
 
During pretrial proceedings, both parties requested
 
that the circuit court invoke the witness exclusion rule pursuant
 
6
to Rule 615 of the Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE),  which was
granted by the circuit court. Bailey contends that the State violated the witness exclusion rule and that Officer Doyle's 
testimony should have been stricken. In its answering brief, the 
State does not argue that it complied with the witness exclusion 
rule, but instead asserts that the alleged violation was 
harmless. We conclude that, even assuming arguendo that the 
witness exclusion rule was circumvented, the circuit court did 
not abuse its discretion in denying Bailey's request to strike 
Officer Doyle's testimony and there was no prejudice to Bailey. 
See State v. Steger
, 114 Hawai' i 162, 158 P.3d 280 (App. 2006); 
State v. Elmaleh, 7 Haw. App. 488, 782 P.2d 886 (1989). 
On the trial day in question, prior to the lunch break,
 
Officer Doyle's testimony on direct examination concluded and his
 
cross-examination commenced. During his direct examination,
 
6
 HRE Rule 615 states, in relevant part:
 
Exclusion of witnesses  At the request of a party the court
shall order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the
testimony of other witnesses, and it may make the order of
its own motion. . . .
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Officer Doyle testified that in his search of Bailey's vehicle he
 
remembered seeing "cleaning stuff," but he did not recall seeing
 
any carpet shampoo.
 
Subsequently, during the lunch break that day, Officer
 
Doyle was present at a meeting where the deputy prosecuting
 
attorney (DPA) interviewed Dana Souza (Souza), the public
 
defender's investigator and a potential witness. Also present at
 
the interview was the prosecutor's investigator, Joanne
 
Allencastre (Allencastre). Defense counsel was not present at
 
the interview.
 
After the lunch recess ended, defense counsel brought
 
the interview to the circuit court's attention and argued that
 
the witness exclusion rule was violated by Officer Doyle's
 
presence at Souza's interview. The defense asserted that Officer
 
Doyle sat in on the interview even though he still had not
 
completed his testimony and therefore his testimony should be
 
stricken. The DPA responded that Officer Doyle was present at
 
the interview because: "[T]his is an ongoing investigation which
 
is led by Officer Ken Doyle. He was present for a witness
 
interview, a potential witness involved in his investigation, and
 
for that purpose, Officer Doyle was included." Defense counsel
 
argued that "the issue is that the testimony that is to be
 
elicited from Mr. Souza will go directly adversely to what we've
 
already heard Office Doyle testify to, relative to an object
 
being in the vehicle." Defense counsel clarified that his
 
concern was that there was a discussion during the interview
 
about a bottle of carpet cleaning shampoo in Bailey's vehicle,
 
and counsel argued there was harm because "now [Officer Doyle]
 
can comport his testimony" in violation of the witness exclusion
 
4
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
rule. The circuit court concluded there was no violation and
 
denied Bailey's motion to strike Officer Doyle's testimony.7
 
Following this discussion, the defense continued its
 
cross-examination of Officer Doyle. Officer Doyle maintained
 
that he did not recall seeing a carpet shampoo bottle in Bailey's
 
vehicle and agreed that it was possible that carpet shampoo was
 
in the vehicle but he failed to notice it.
 
The purpose of HRE Rule 615 is "to prevent the shaping
 
of testimony by one witness to match that of another, and to
 
discourage fabrication and collusion." Elmaleh, 7 Haw. App. at
 
492, 782 P.2d at 889 (quoting Miller v. Universal City Studios,
 Inc., 650 F.2d 1365, 1373 (5th Cir. 1981)); see also Commentary
 
to HRE Rule 615. The rule speaks to excluding prospective
 
witnesses from the courtroom, but courts, including this court,
 
"have not countenanced the circumvention of the rule." Elmaleh,
 
7 Haw. App. at 492, 782 P.2d at 889 (citation omitted).
 
In this case, Officer Doyle had not completed giving
 
his testimony when he sat in on the interview of Souza, a
 potential defense witness who had not yet testified. The State
 
does not assert to this court compliance with the witness
 
exclusion rule and we will thus presume for purposes of this
 
appeal, without deciding, that a violation occurred. Assuming
 
such a violation in this case, it was harmless.
 
HRE Rule 615 is silent regarding the appropriate
 
penalty in the event of noncompliance with the rule. See
 
Commentary to HRE Rule 615. However, the sanctions which a court
 chooses to attach in such circumstances "is a matter within the
 
discretion of the court." Elmaleh, 7 Haw. App. at 493, 782 P.2d
 
at 889 (quoting Harkins v. Ikeda, 57 Haw. 378, 384, 557 P.2d 788,
 
7
 The court reasoned that "there's no surprise . . . because that
issue's already come up. It was disclosed that Mr. Souza was going to testify
to something." The court rejected defense counsel's notion of a "direct line
of appearance of impropriety," stating that "[a]ll of that can be gone into in
Cross-Examination. So I don't see any real prejudice." 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
792 (1976)). "The general rule is that noncompliance with a
 
sequestration order under HRE Rule 615 does not require a new
 
trial 'unless the court's decision to allow the allegedly tainted
 
testimony was an abuse of discretion or resulted in prejudice to
 
the defendant.'" Id. at 493, 782 P.2d at 890 (citing United
 
States v. Prichard, 781 F.2d 179, 183 (10th Cir. 1986)). The
 defendant bears the burden of proving prejudice or an abuse of
 
discretion. Id. at 493-94, 782 P.2d at 890 (citation omitted).
 
Bailey urges this court to grant a new trial because he
 
was prejudiced inasmuch as "Officer Doyle knew that Mr. Souza
 
would testify that the bottle of carpet shampoo he saw on
 
April 17, 2007 was missing as of June 10, 2007. . . . [and was]
 
able to refute Mr. Souza's testimony before Mr. Souza could
 
testify[.]"
 
We conclude that Bailey fails to demonstrate prejudice
 
or that the circuit court abused its discretion in denying his
 
request to strike Officer Doyle's testimony. As a fundamental
 
matter, Bailey fails to argue or demonstrate how the presence or
 
absence of the carpet shampoo bottle in his vehicle is of any
 
consequence to the charges in this case. Bailey makes no
 
connection between the carpet shampoo bottle and the evidence
 
showing that he possessed dangerous drugs, that he possessed drug
 
paraphernalia, and that he was driving without being duly
 
licensed.
 
Even assuming the carpet shampoo bottle had any
 
relevance, Officer Doyle did not manipulate or bolster his
 
testimony in anticipation of Souza's testimony. Before the
 
interview of Souza, Officer Doyle had already testified on direct
 
examination that he did not recall seeing a carpet shampoo
 
bottle. His testimony about the carpet shampoo, even after being
 
present at Souza's interview, remained materially the same. See
 
Elmaleh, 7 Haw. App. at 493-94, 782 P.2d at 890 (witness
 exclusion rule was violated when complaining witness who still
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
had to testify was present at a meeting between prosecuting
 
attorney and arresting officer, who had not yet completed giving
 
his testimony; however, violation was harmless because inter alia
 
the complaining witness did not shape her testimony to conform to
 
the officer's testimony).
 
Further, Bailey was not prejudiced because the circuit 
court gave the defense the opportunity to cross-examine Officer 
Doyle about the meeting and raise any credibility issues 
associated with his presence at the meeting. See Steger, 114 
Hawai'i at 175, 158 P.3d at 293 (holding that, even assuming 
sequestration order was violated when investigating officer 
viewed an exhibit previously marked by two other witnesses, it 
was harmless because inter alia circuit court took sufficient 
remedial action by permitting defendant to cross-examine the 
investigating officer about his having viewed the exhibit). The 
defense chose not to cross-examine Officer Doyle about Souza's 
interview, which further underscores its non-prejudicial nature 
given the circumstances of this case. 
We thus conclude that, even assuming there was a
 
violation of the witness exclusion rule in this case, it was
 
harmless and the circuit court did not abuse its discretion or
 
prejudice Bailey in denying his motion to strike Officer Doyle's
 
testimony.
 
II. Exhibit 36
 
Bailey next argues that the circuit court committed
 
plain error in admitting Exhibit 36 because it is inadmissible
 
hearsay evidence. The exhibit is a five page document from the
 
County of Maui Department of Finance, Motor Vehicle & Licensing
 
Division (County Department of Finance). The State offered
 
Exhibit 36, without objection from the defense, as evidence that
 
Bailey did not have a valid driver's license on November 17,
 
2007, the date of the offense. No witness appeared from the
 
County Department of Finance. The State offered the exhibit as a
 
7
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
self-authenticating document, a public record under seal, and a
 
business record. Pursuant to HRE Rules 803(b)(8) and 902(4),
 
Exhibit 36 was a properly admitted self-authenticated public
 
record.
 
The first page of Exhibit 36 is a memorandum signed by
 
Debbie A. Silva (Silva), custodian of public records for the
 
County Department of Finance, attesting inter alia that "[o]n
 
November 17, 2007, Defendant did not have a valid Hawaii drivers
 
license and/or permit." Pages two through five of the exhibit
 
consist of various computer print-outs indicating, inter alia,
 
that Bailey's driver's license was expired as of October 7, 2004.
 
Pursuant to HRE Rule 803(b)(8), Exhibit 36 falls under
 
an exception to the hearsay rule as a public record or report. 
HRE Rule 803(b)(8) provides:
 
Rule 803 Hearsay exceptions; availability of declarant
immaterial. The following are not excluded by the hearsay
rule, even though the declarant is available as a witness:
 
. . . 
(b) Other exceptions.
 . . . 
(8) Public records and reports. Records, reports,
statements, or data compilations, in any form, of public
offices or agencies, setting forth (A) the activities of the
office or agency, or (B) matters observed pursuant to duty
imposed by law as to which matters there was a duty to
report, excluding, however, in criminal cases matters
observed by police officers and other law enforcement
personnel, or (C) in civil proceedings and against the
government in criminal cases, factual findings resulting
from an investigation made pursuant to authority granted by
law, unless the sources of information or other
circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.
 
Exhibit 36 consists of a data compilation and report by a public
 
agency regarding the activities of the agency, i.e. data related
 
to drivers licensing. It provides the supporting records and
 
reports on the data kept under the agency's authority. See City
 
and Cnty. of Honolulu v. Sherman, 110 Hawai' i 39, 75, 129 P.3d 
542, 578 (2006); U.S. v. Puente
, 826 F.2d 1415, 1418 (5th Cir.
 
1987) (construing materially identical Rule 803(8) of the Federal
 Rules of Evidence and holding it was proper to admit information
 
recorded by a public official as part of routine procedure
 
8
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
although later retrieved in connection with litigation);
 
HRS § 286-101 (2007 Repl.) (Designation of examiner of drivers)
 
and § 286-118 (2007 Repl.) (Records to be kept by the examiner of
 
drivers).
 
Pursuant to HRE Rule 902(4), Exhibit 36 is also
 
properly self-authenticated. This rule states:
 
Extrinsic evidence of authenticity as a condition
precedent to admissibility is not required with respect to
the following:
 . . . 
(4) Certified copies of public records. A copy of an
official record or report or entry therein, or of a document
authorized by law to be recorded or filed and actually
recorded or filed in a public office, including data
compilations in any form, 
certified as correct by the
custodian or other person authorized to make the
certification
, by certificate complying with paragraph (1),
(2), or (3) or complying with any statute or rule prescribed
by the supreme court. 
(Emphasis added). Page one of the exhibit contains the following
 
certification executed by Silva:
 
I, Debbie A. Silva, Custodian of Public Records of the
Department of Finance, Motor Vehicles & Licensing Division,
do hereby certify that this is a full, true and correct copy
of all official records or reports or entries therein, or of
documents authorized by law to be recorded or filed and
actually recorded or filed, including data compilations in
any form, with the Motor Vehicles & Licensing Division of
the Department of Finance.
 
Pages two through four of Exhibit 36 have a materially similar
 
certification. These certifications, by the custodian of record,
 
comply with HRE Rule 902(4). 
Exhibit 36 falls under an exception to the hearsay rule
 
and was properly self-authenticated. There was no plain error by
 
the circuit court in admitting this exhibit.8

 On November 9, 2011, Bailey submitted a letter pursuant to Rule 28(j)
of the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) directing the court's
attention to Bullcoming v. New Mexico, __ U.S. __, 131 S.Ct. 2705 (2011).
Bailey never raised any issue related to the confrontation clause in thecircuit court and did not raise it as a point of error on appeal. This issue has therefore been waived. See State v. Hoglund, 71 Haw. 147, 150, 785 P.2d
1311, 1313 (1990); State v. Fitzwater, 122 Hawai' i 354, 371 n.10, 227 P.3d
520, 537 n.10 (2010); HRAP Rule 28(b)(4). 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
III. Assistance of Trial Counsel
 
Bailey argues that he received ineffective assistance
 
of counsel because his trial counsel failed to object to the
 
admission of Exhibit 36 and to evidence of pornography found in
 
his vehicle.
 
Bailey has the burden of establishing ineffective
 
assistance of counsel. See Briones v. State, 74 Haw. 442, 462,
 
848 P.2d 966, 976 (1993); State v. Antone, 62 Haw. 346, 348, 615
 P.2d 101, 104 (1980). The requirement to establish ineffective
 
assistance of counsel is two-fold: "[f]irst, the appellant must
 
establish specific errors or omissions of defense counsel
 
reflecting counsel's lack of skill, judgment or diligence. 
Second, the appellant must establish that these errors or
 
omissions resulted in either the withdrawal or substantial
 
impairment of a potentially meritorious defense." Antone, 62
 
Haw. at 348-49, 615 P.2d at 104 (internal citations omitted).
 
As discussed above, Exhibit 36 was properly admitted by
 
the circuit court as a self-authenticating public record. Trial
 counsel was not required to make a "futile objection," see id. at
 
351, 615 P.2d at 106, and thus lack of an objection to the
 
exhibit as inadmissible hearsay does not constitute ineffective
 
assistance of counsel.
 
Regarding the evidence of pornography, Bailey argues
 
that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance because
 
counsel failed to object when Officers Moore and Doyle testified
 
about pornography found in Bailey's vehicle and that pornography
 
is commonly encountered or found in a drug investigation. Bailey
 
also faults trial counsel for failing to object to the admission
 
of Exhibits 14 and 24, photos he contends depict pornography. 
Bailey argues that the evidence of pornography served no relevant
 
purpose, and even assuming that it was relevant, its probative
 
value was substantially outweighed by the dangers of unfair
 
prejudice.
 
10
   
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The State responds that Bailey fails to show prejudice
 
by the introduction of the pornography evidence because it was
 
not illegal under HRS § 712-1214 (1993 Repl.) for him to have
 
pornography in his car. The State also argues that the evidence
 
was relevant under HRE Rule 401 because the officers were asked
 
to explain what was depicted in the photographs they took of
 
Bailey's vehicle, and further, it was a tactical choice for
 
Bailey's trial counsel not to make a futile objection which could
 
have only emphasized the pornography even more to the jury.
 
Bailey does not meet his burden of establishing that
 
his trial counsel was ineffective. We first note that trial
 
counsel did object once, on foundation grounds, when Officer
 
Doyle was asked if it was unusual to find pornography in a
 
narcotics investigation. The objection was overruled.
 
Whether it was error for trial counsel not to further
 
object is debatable. As the State argues, it may have been a
 
tactical decision by trial counsel in order not to emphasize the
 
pornography even further. "Defense counsel's tactical decisions
 
at trial generally will not be questioned by a reviewing court." 
Antone, 62 Haw. at 352, 615 P.2d at 106 (citation omitted). 
Because the record is void regarding the basis for trial
 
counsel's actions or non-actions, trial counsel should be given
 
an opportunity to explain. Briones, 74 Haw. at 463, 848 P.2d at
 
977.
 
Bailey also fails to show that trial counsel's alleged
 
error substantially impaired a potentially meritorious defense. 
Trial testimony was undisputed that Bailey was the owner, driver,
 
and only occupant of the vehicle the night of his arrest. A
 
search warrant executed by police uncovered evidence of crystal
 
methamphetamine in violation of HRS § 712-1243(1), as well as
 
illegal drug paraphernalia in violation of HRS § 329-43.5(a). 
The evidence at trial further established that Bailey was driving
 
with an expired license, in violation of HRS § 286-102. Bailey's
 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
only witness, Souza, testified inter alia that carpet cleaner was
 
present in Bailey's vehicle on April 17, 2008 and subsequently
 
removed on June 10, 2008. Bailey fails to show that the
 
pornography evidence impaired any meritorious defense.
 
Bailey's appellate counsel was substituted for trial 
counsel after the appeal was filed in this case. Because 
appellate counsel did not have an opportunity to develop a record 
regarding the ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim, we 
reject this claim without prejudice to a subsequent proceeding 
under Rule 40 of the Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure. 
IV. Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the Amended Judgment Conviction
 
and Sentence entered on December 3, 2008 in the Circuit Court of
 
the Second Circuit is affirmed.
