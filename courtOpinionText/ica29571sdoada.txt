v.
DONALD S. RULLO and HO #OMAU I MUA LLC., a Hawaii
Limited Liability Company, Defendants-Appellees
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 08-1-0146K)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
Plaintiffs-Appellants The Eric Johns Peck Trust Dated
July 6, 2006 and its Trustee Eric Johns Peck; Puaita Guy Pulotu;
Marcy Deana Pulotu; Ethan Charles Sharkey; and Karen Marie Morgan
(collectively, Plaintiffs) appeal from the "Order Granting
Defendant Donald S. Rullo's Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens"
(Order) filed on December 18, 2008 in the Circuit Court of the
Third Circuit (circuit court).1  In the Order, the circuit court
granted the Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens (Motion to Expunge)
filed by Defendant-Appellee Donald S. Rullo (Rullo) on
November 26, 2008 and ordered "that the lis pendens is hereby
expunged."  The circuit court stated that "[t]he claims for
relief sought by Plaintiffs do not include a claim directly
seeking to obtain title or possession of real property.  [S.]
Utsunomiya Enterprises, Inc. v. Moomuku Country Club, 75 Haw.
480[, 866 P.2d 951] (1994)."
On appeal, Plaintiffs contend the circuit court erred
in granting the Motion to Expunge for the following reasons:NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
  HRS § 634-51 provides in relevant part:2
§634-51  Recording of notice of pendency of action.  In any
action concerning real property or affecting the title or the
right of possession of real property, the plaintiff, at the time
of filing the complaint, and any other party at the time of filing
a pleading in which affirmative relief is claimed, or at any time
afterwards, may record in the bureau of conveyances a notice of
the pendency of the action, containing the names or designations
of the parties, as set out in the summons or pleading, the object
of the action or claim for affirmative relief, and a description
of the property affected thereby.  From and after the time of
recording the notice, a person who becomes a purchaser or
incumbrancer of the property affected shall be deemed to have
constructive notice of the pendency of the action and be bound by
any judgment entered therein if the person claims through a party
to the action; provided that in the case of registered land,
section 501-151 and sections 501-241 to 501-248 shall govern.
2(1)Pursuant to HRS § 634-51 (Supp. 2008),2 Plaintiffs
were entitled to file their Notice of Pendency of Action (NOPA) 
because they brought their action to enforce the April 26, 2000
Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions (CCRs),
which was part of the title to property (Lot 8) owned by Rullo
and Ho#omau I Mua LLC (Ho# omau) (collectively, Defendants) located
in the Opihihale Sunset View Estates development in South Kona on
the Island of Hawai# i and which was an encumbrance on the title
to Lot 8.
(2)Plaintiffs filed the NOPA for the proper purposes
ccording to HRS § 634-51, i.e., to preserve their right to
nforce the CCRs, provide notice to any prospective bona fide
urchasers of the pending action, and ensure that Rullo would not
ail to fully and honestly disclose the pending action to a
otential purchaser.a
e
p
f

(3)Hawai#i and national case law supports a court's
allowing a notice of pendency of action in an action to enforce
restrictive covenants.
Plaintiffs ask this court to reverse the Order and
remand "with directions to authorize [Plaintiffs] to file a
notice of pendency of action pursuant to [HRS] § 634-51."
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we hold that theNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
3circuit court did not abuse its discretion by granting the Motion
to Expunge because the lis pendens was not "limited in
application to actions directly seeking to obtain title to or
possession of real property," S. Utsunomiya Enters., 75 Haw. at
484, 866 P.2d at 956, and, therefore, the lis pendens was
invalid.  See also Knauer v. Foote, 101 Hawai #i 81, 89, 63 P.3d
389, 397 (2003) (stating that a lis pendens should be properly
expunged where a party's claims do not attempt to obtain title to
or possession of the real property at issue); TSA Int'l Ltd. v.
Shimizu Corp., 92 Hawai# i 243, 267, 990 P.2d 713, 737 (1999)
(stating that application of lis pendens should be limited to
actions directly seeking to obtain title to or possession of real
property).
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Order Granting Defendant
Donald S. Rullo's Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens" filed on
December 18, 2008 in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit is
affirmed.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, July 26, 2010.
