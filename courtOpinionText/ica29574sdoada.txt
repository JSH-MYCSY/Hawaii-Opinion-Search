APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 06-1-1841)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
In an appeal arising out of allegations of wrongful
termination of employment, Plaintiff-Appellant pro se Kevin
Milnes (Milnes) appeals from the Judgment filed on February 19,
2009 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit1 (circuit court). 
The circuit court entered judgment in favor of Defendant-Appellee
Dick Pacific Construction, Co., Ltd. (DPC) and against Milnes.
On appeal, Milnes contends the circuit court erred
(1) in barring his discrimination claims based on
retaliation and disability by granting DPC's Motion for Partial
Summary Judgment; 
(2) in concluding he failed to prove his termination
was because of his race or age;
(3) in concluding there was insufficient evidence to
support his claim of negligent or intentional infliction of
emotional distress;
(4) in barring his economic loss claim by granting
DPC's Motion in Limine2;NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2(5) in crediting DPC's witnesses' testimony over his
testimony;
(6) by not taking into account his pro se status; and
(7) in not deferring to the case law he cited.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude 
that Milnes' appeal is without merit.
Therefore, 
The Judgment filed on February 19, 2009 in the Circuit
Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, July 20, 2010.
