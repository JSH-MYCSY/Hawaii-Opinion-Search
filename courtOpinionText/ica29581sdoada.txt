IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
DARIA BRUCE, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 06-1-0018)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Daria Bruce (Bruce) appeals from
 
the Judgment entered on December 26, 2008, by the Circuit Court
 
of the Fifth Circuit (Circuit Court), convicting and sentencing
 
her for theft in the first degree in violation of Hawaii Revised
 
Statutes (HRS) § 708-830.5 (Supp. 2007).1
 
On appeal, Bruce maintains that the Circuit Court erred
 
in: (1) refusing her requested specific unanimity instruction;
 
(2) denying her motion to dismiss because the State failed to
 
aver facts in the indictment pertaining to the timeliness of
 
prosecution; and (3) denying Bruce's motion in limine to preclude
 
the State from introducing evidence of Bruce's alleged prior bad
 
acts.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to

 The Honorable Randal G.B. Valenciano presided.
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Bruce's points of error as follows:
 
(1) "[T]he right of an accused to a unanimous verdict
 
in a criminal prosecution, tried before a jury in a court of this
 
state[] is guaranteed by article I, sections 5 and 14 of the
 
Hawai'i Constitution." State v. Arceo, 84 Hawai' i 1, 30, 928 P.2d 
843, 872 (1996). In Arceo, the Hawai' i Supreme Court held: 
[W]hen separate and distinct culpable acts are subsumed
within a single count charging a sexual assault-any one of
which could support a conviction thereunder-and the
defendant is ultimately convicted by a jury of the charged
offense, the defendant's constitutional right to a unanimous
verdict is violated unless one or both of the following
occurs: (1) at or before the close of its case-in-chief, the
prosecution is required to elect the specific act upon which
it is relying to establish the "conduct" element of the
charged offense; or (2) the trial court gives the jury a
specific unanimity instruction, i.e., an instruction that
advises the jury that all twelve of its members must agree
that the same underlying criminal act has been proved beyond
a reasonable doubt.
 
Id. at 32-33, 928 P.2d at 874-75. "[T]he purpose of an Arceo 
unanimity instruction is to eliminate any ambiguity that might 
infect the jury's deliberations respecting the particular 
conduct in which the defendant is accused of engaging and that 
allegedly constitutes the charged offense." State v. Valentine, 
93 Hawai' i 199, 208, 998 P.2d 479, 488 (2000). 
Beyond the context of sexual assault, the supreme court 
has held that a specific unanimity instruction must be given if "(1) at trial, the prosecution adduces proof of two or more 
separate and distinct culpable acts; and (2) the prosecution 
seeks to submit to the jury that only one offense was committed." 
Id. However, no specific unanimity instruction need be given if 
"(1) the offense is not defined in such a manner as to preclude it from being proved as a continuous offense and (2) the 
prosecution alleges, adduces evidence of, and argues that the 
defendant's actions constituted a continuous course of conduct." 
State v. Apao, 95 Hawai' i 440, 447, 24 P.3d 32, 39 (2001). See 
also State v. Hironaka, 99 Hawai' i 198, 208, 53 P.3d 806, 816 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2002) (A specific unanimity instruction need not be given if 
"the prosecution adduces evidence of a series of acts by the 
defendant that constitutes a 'continuous course of conduct.'"); 
State v. Stenger, 122 Hawai' i 271, 289, 226 P.3d 441, 459 (2010) 
("[A]s long as evidence is adduced that the defendant engaged in a continuous 'series of acts' constituting the crime charged, and 
the prosecution argues the case accordingly, a specific unanimity 
instruction is unnecessary."). We conclude that, under the 
circumstances of this case, both of the aforementioned 
requirements identified in Apao were satisfied, and Bruce's 
charged theft in the first degree by deception constituted a 
continuous offense under the facts and circumstances of the 
instant case; thus, no specific unanimity instruction was 
required. See also State v. Whitaker, 117 Hawai' i 26, 175 P.3d 
136 (App. 2007); State v. Martin, 62 Haw. 364, 367-69, 616 P.2d 193, 196-97 (1980); cf. Stenger, 122 Hawai' i at 289-93, 226 P.3d 
at 459-63. 
(2) As the Hawai' i Supreme Court noted in Martin, "the 
date of the most recent act of a continuing offense governs the application of the statute of limitations." Martin, 62 Haw. at 
372, 616 P.2d at 198 (citations omitted). In Martin, the relevant indictment charged the defendant with wrongfully 
obtaining state property by deception from January 1, 1973, 
through January 30, 1976. Martin, 62 Haw. at 366, 616 P.2d at 
195. Because the defendant's illicit scheme continued into 1976,
 
the supreme court concluded that the August 17, 1977 indictment
 
was timely filed within the three-year limitations period. 
Martin, 62 Haw. at 372, 616 P.2d at 198. Similarly, in the
 
instant case, the indictment brought against Bruce charged her
 
with obtaining and exerting control of property of the church by
 
deception with the intent to permanently deprive, for the period
 
on or about January 1, 1999 through April 30, 2005.

Bruce's reliance on State v. Stan's Contracting, Inc., 
111 Hawai' i 17, 137 P.3d 331 (2006), is misplaced. Stan's 
Contracting requires that "when the charged offense is theft by 
deception as defined by HRS § 708-830(2) (1993), and the 
prosecution is relying on the tolling provision of HRS 
§ 701-108(3)(a), . . . the prosecution must not only allege the 
timely date or dates of commission of the offense in the 
indictment, but also the earliest date of the discovery of the 
offense."  Stan's Contracting, 111 Hawai' i at 19, 34, 137 P.3d at 
333, 348. The supreme court limits the requirement of alleging 
the earliest date of discovery to instances in which the 
prosecution is relying on a tolling provision under HRS § 701­
708(3)(a). Id. Here, the State was not relying on such an 
exception to the statute of limitations. Accordingly, consistent with the rule articulated in Martin that "the date of the most 
recent act of a continuing offense governs the application of the 
statute of limitations[,]" Martin, 62 Haw. at 372, 616 P.2d at 
198, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not err in denying Bruce's motion to dismiss the indictment. 
(3) In the Circuit Court proceedings, Bruce argued in
 
limine that evidence of the Holy Cross/Sacred Heart Filipino
 
Catholic Club (FCC) account activity was "prior act" evidence
 
falling within the scope of Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule
 
404(b), thereby requiring reasonable pre-trial notice. The State
 
argued in response that HRE Rule 404(b) pertains to "other
 
crimes, wrongs, or acts," and that the FCC account activity did
 
not constitute "other acts." Rather, it was part of "one act"
 
and "one plan" that involved "[d]epositing checks that were
 
supposed to go into one bank account into another bank account,
 
not reflecting on treasury reports and then taking out cash,
 
writing checks for cash to herself." The Circuit Court agreed:
 
The [Circuit] Court's understanding is that the acts
involving the church in this particular case also involve
the Filipino Catholic Charities Club, and that the church –­
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
the acts involving the church and the Filipino Catholic Club
is alleged to be one act or scheme occurring over the same
time frame as charging the Defendant.
Because these are all the same acts or scheme, these
are not independent acts or other acts. And there's no need
 to provide independent notice as required by 404(b). The
 [Circuit] Court believes 404(b) intended to exclude other
acts or other independent acts that could have prejudicial
effect on this case.
 
On appeal, Bruce does not directly challenge the
 
Circuit Court's aforementioned conclusion. Rather, Bruce argues
 
for the first time on appeal that the State attempted to bypass
 
the requirements of HRE Rule 404(b) "under the guise" of the
 
2
doctrine of res gestae,  which was found to be no longer viable
in 
State v. Fetelee, 117 Hawai' i 53, 175 P.3d 709 (2008). 
Although Bruce correctly identifies the supreme court's
 
holding in Fetelee, i.e., that the HRE supersede the common law
 
3
res gestae doctrine,  the State did not argue the admissibility
of the FCC account evidence pursuant to the 
res gestae doctrine. 
Accordingly, it is unclear how 
Fetelee supports Bruce's argument 
of error. Even assuming that the res gestae doctrine was 
implicated, Bruce failed to object or argue that the res gestae 
doctrine was no longer valid. Accordingly, this argument was 
waived. See Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 
28(b)(4)(iii); see also, e.g., State v. Moses, 102 Hawai' i 449, 
456, 77 P.3d 940, 947 (2003); State v. Ildefonso, 72 Haw. 573, 
584, 827 P.2d 648, 655 (1992) ("Our review of the record reveals 
that [the defendant] did not raise this argument at trial, and 
thus it is deemed to have been waived."); State v. Hoglund, 71 
Haw. 147, 150, 785 P.2d 1311, 1313 (1990) ("Generally, the 
2
 The term res gestae "generally refers to the circumstances, facts,
and declarations that grow out of the main fact and serve to illustrate its
character and that are so spontaneous and contemporaneous with the main factas to exclude the idea of deliberation or fabrication." Fetelee, 117 Hawai' i 
at 64, 175 P.3d at 720.

failure to properly raise an issue at the trial level precludes a
 
party from raising that issue on appeal.") 
Indeed, the Circuit Court did not err in its
 
determination that evidence pertaining to the FCC account did not
 
constitute "other acts" evidence and was not subject to the HRE
 
Rule 404(b) independent notice requirement. According to the
 
State, Bruce obtained and exerted control of the victims'
 
property by deception through funneling money through the FCC
 
bank account. The deposit and withdraw of funds from the FCC
 
account was part of the alleged crime itself. See Addison M.
 
Bowman, Hawaii Rules of Evidence Manual § 404-3 (3d ed. 2006)
 ("'Other crimes, wrongs, or acts' refers to instances of a
 
person's behavior 'other' than those alleged in the current
 
proceeding."). It was the means by which the State alleged Bruce
 
obtained and exerted control over the property of Holy Cross
 
Church and Sacred Heart Parish and its parishioners. 
Accordingly, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not err in
 
denying Bruce's motion in limine with respect to allowing
 
evidence of the FCC account activity.
 
For these reasons, we affirm the Circuit Court's
 
December 26, 2008 Judgment.
