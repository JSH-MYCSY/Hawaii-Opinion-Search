On August 18, 1994, in Cr. No. 94-0037(3), a jury
 
convicted Ramsey of Sexual Assault in the Third Degree and
 
Burglary in the First Degree. The circuit court entered a
 
Judgment on October 28, 1994. Ramsey did not appeal from the
 
Judgment.
 
On March 17, 1997, pursuant to Rule 40 of the Hawai' i 
Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP), Ramsey, pro se, filed a Petition 
for Post-Conviction Relief (First Petition) in S.P.P. No. 97­
0004(3). Ramsey alleged that his conviction had been obtained by 
the unconstitutional failure of the State of Hawai' i (State) to 
disclose exculpatory evidence, he was denied effective assistance of trial counsel, and he was denied the right to appeal. The 
circuit court denied the First Petition without a hearing. 
Ramsey appealed, and counsel was appointed to represent Ramsey on 
appeal. This court affirmed in part and vacated in part the 
circuit court's denial and remanded the case to the circuit court 
to conduct an evidentiary hearing on, inter alia, Ramsey's claim 
that he was denied effective assistance of trial counsel because 
counsel failed to properly advise him on his decision to testify 
at trial. This court also instructed that on remand Ramsey could 
file an amended petition to incorporate additional issues. 
On August 9, 1999, with the assistance of appointed
 
counsel, Ramsey filed an amended First Petition (Amended First
 
Petition), in which he also asserted, inter alia, ineffective
 
assistance of trial counsel for counsel's failure to (1)
 
investigate the case; (2) withdraw as counsel as requested; (3)
 
file various motions, including speedy trial; (4) question or
 
cross-examine witnesses during the course of the trial; (5) file
 
a direct appeal; (6) raise the issue of improper questioning by
 
the police; (7) advise Ramsey of the consequences of testifying
 
at trial; (8) consolidate sentencing with probation revocation
 
proceedings; (9) raise the issue of ignorance or mistake of fact
 
as a jury instruction or defense; (10) raise Ramsey's

intoxication to negate the requisite mens rea; and (11) raise the
 
issue of Ramsey's competency to stand trial.
 
On February 18, 2000, the circuit court denied the
 
Amended First Petition. On August 28, 2001, this court affirmed
 
the denial of the Amended First Petition in No. 23288.
 
On September 25, 2003, Ramsey filed a Petition for
 
Post-Conviction Relief (Second Petition) in S.P.P. No. 03-1­
0016(3). The Second Petition stated a claim for ineffective
 
assistance of trial counsel for counsel's failure to warn Ramsey
 
against testifying under the influence of an antidepressant. On
 
April 19, 2004, without a hearing, the circuit court denied the
 
Second Petition. On July 28, 2005, this court affirmed the
 
denial of Ramsey's Second Petition in No. 26557. 
On August 31, 2005, Ramsey filed a Petition for Post-
Conviction Relief (Third Petition) in S.P.P. No. 05-1-0025(2),
 
alleging prosecutorial misconduct. On December 7, 2005, the
 
circuit court denied the Third Petition without a hearing. 
Ramsey appealed the denial of his petition.
 
On January 3, Ramsey filed a Petition for Post-
Conviction Relief (Fourth Petition) in S.P.P. 06-1-0002(3). 
Ramsey claimed he had received ineffective assistance of counsel
 
because, inter alia, his trial counsel failed to request that the
 
jury be instructed that Criminal Trespass in the First Degree is
 
an included offense to the charge of Burglary in the First
 
Degree. On March 11, 2006, the circuit court granted the State's
 
motion to dismiss the Fourth Petition. Ramsey appealed the
 
dismissal of the Fourth Petition.
 
On May 15, 2008, this court affirmed the denial of the
 
Third Petition and vacated the circuit court's March 11, 2006
 
order dismissing the Fourth Petition. This court remanded the
 
Fourth Petition for further proceedings.
 
On August 5, 2008, Ramsey filed a Petition for Post-
Conviction Relief (Fifth Petition) in S.P.P. No. 08-1-0014(3).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On October 22, 2008, Ramsey filed a Petition for Post-
Conviction Relief (Sixth Petition) in S.P.P. No. 08-1-0017(3),
 
alleging, inter alia, ineffective assistance of counsel for trial
 
counsel's failure to call two expert witnesses on the question of
 
Ramsey's fitness to proceed.
 
On December 17, 2010, the circuit court issued the
 
Order, in which the court denied the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth
 
Petitions, stating that the issues raised in the petitions had
 
been "previously ruled upon or were knowingly and understandingly
 
waived" by Ramsey and his claims were "patently frivolous and
 
without trace of support either in the record or from other
 
evidence" submitted by Ramsey. Ramsey filed, pro se, an appeal
 
from the Order.
 
On appeal, Ramsey raises only one error from his Fourth
 
Petition in S.P.P. No. 06-1-0002(3): he received ineffective
 
assistance of counsel because his trial counsel failed to request
 
that the jury be instructed that Criminal Trespass in the First
 
Degree is an included offense of Burglary in the First Degree.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
conclude that Ramsey's appeal is without merit.
 
The issue of ineffective assistance of counsel has been
 
ruled upon, and, therefore, relief is not available pursuant to
 
HRPP Rule 40. HRPP Rule 40(a)(3). In addition, to the extent
 
this particular claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was
 
not previously raised and addressed, it was waived. HRPP Rule
 
40(a)(3).
 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Order Denying, Without
 
Evidentiary Hearing, Petitions to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct
 Judgment or Release Petitioner from Custody filed on December 17,
