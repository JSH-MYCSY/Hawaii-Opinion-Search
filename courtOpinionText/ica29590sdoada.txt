APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 08-1-0250)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
In an appeal arising out of a personal injury lawsuit,
 
Defendant-Appellant Charles McNair (McNair) appeals from the
 
"Order Denying [McNair's] Motion to Compel Arbitration of
 
Plaintiff's Claims Against [McNair] Under [Hawaii Revised
 
Statutes (HRS)] § 431:10C-213.5 Pursuant to Agreement" filed on
 
January 7, 2009 in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit1
 
(circuit court). 
On appeal, McNair contends the circuit court 
erroneously denied his motion to compel arbitration because there
 was an agreement between Plaintiff Elaine Tavares, Individually
 
and as Personal Representative for the Estate of Teresa Jarrett
 
Jacober, (Plaintiff) and McNair to a binding arbitration of
 
Plaintiff's claims against McNair under HRS § 431:10C-213.5 (2005
 
Repl.).
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as

 The Honorable Glenn S. Hara presided.
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude that
 
there were genuine issues of material fact as to the existence of
 
an arbitration agreement and the circuit court properly denied
 
the motion to compel arbitration.
 
On October 18, 2007, McNair proposed private binding
 
arbitration, pursuant to HRS § 431:10C-213.5, to settle
 
Plaintiff's claims against him. On February 4, 2008, Plaintiff
 
responded by conditionally accepting the proposal: "In response
 
to your letter dated October 18, 2007, please be advised
 
[Plaintiff] has agreed to private binding arbitration of her
 
claim and the estate's claim against [McNair] pursuant to HRS
 
§ 431:10C-213.5 provided the parties are able to mutually agree
 
upon a single arbitrator." (Emphasis added.)
 
On February 20, 2008, McNair sent a letter to Plaintiff 
in which McNair offered Plaintiff the names of four persons who
 
could possibly serve as an arbitrator.
 
On February 22, 2008, McNair sent an email to Evelyn
 
Johnson (Johnson) of Dispute Prevention and Resolution (DPR). 
This email purported to confirm the selection of Judge Amano as
 
the mutually agreed-upon arbitrator: "This is to confirm that
 
the parties to this dispute have agreed to submit the question of
 
liability and damages arising from the death of Teresa Jacober to
 
binding private arbitration pursuant to HRS § 431:10C-213.5 with
 
Judge Amano serving as the agreed arbitrator under the terms of
 
this statute." McNair also sent a copy of the email to
 
Plaintiff's counsel on that date. 
From February through September, 2008, the parties
 
attempted to resolve legal issues relevant to the arbitration,
 
including the impact of a joint tortfeasor on the proceedings and
 
the necessity for probate approval. Because the statute of
 
limitations was about to run, Plaintiff filed a complaint on
 
August 4, 2008.
 
In August 2008, McNair learned that Johnson had left
 
DPR in May 2008 without opening a DPR file for the arbitration

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
with Judge Amano. On August 19, 2008, McNair wrote to Judge
 
Amano directly and requested that she arbitrate the parties'
 
dispute.
 
Three days later, Kelly Bryant (Bryant), case manager
 
at DPR, emailed McNair and Plaintiff and informed them of Judge
 
Amano's availability and her disclosures as a potential
 
arbitrator. On September 3, 2008, Plaintiff asked Bryant to put
 
the matter on hold. On September 5, 2008, Plaintiff sent a
 
letter to McNair disclaiming any purported agreement to arbitrate
 
between the parties.
 
On September 15, 2008, McNair filed a "Motion to Compel
 
Arbitration of Plaintiff's Claims Against [McNair] Under HRS
 
§ 431:10C-213.5 Pursuant to Agreement" (Motion to Compel). 
Plaintiff opposed the motion. Plaintiff argued, among other
 
things, that there was no enforceable arbitration agreement
 
because there were unresolved issues regarding joint tortfeasor
 
liability and probate approval and, therefore, no agreement on
 
the scope of the proposed arbitration. The circuit court denied
 
the Motion to Compel on the basis that there was not a mutually
 
agreed-upon agreement under HRS § 431:10C-213.5 to arbitrate. In
 
reaching this conclusion, the circuit court preliminarily found
 
at the hearing on the motion that a mutual agreement as to an
 
arbitrator was a condition precedent to arbitration. The circuit
 
court pressed McNair to produce evidence substantiating
 
Plaintiff's consent to Judge Amano's serving as the arbitrator:
 
[THE COURT:] So, [McNair's Counsel], I've read the
memos and I'm just wondering, do you have any argument or
any other thing you can point to me that says this is when
we -- [Plaintiff's Counsel] explicitly agreed to Judge Amano
as an arbitrator? I know that you have e-mails to DPR and
so forth saying, you know, set the arbitration up. But
 anybody can do that. I mean, I can call Triple A right now
and say I want an arbitration without an arbitration
agreement. You know, but I can go ahead and start setting
stuff up in anticipation, for example, of getting an
arbitration hearing.
 
But is there anything that you can point to that would
indicate that [Plaintiff's Counsel] agreed beforehand to
Judge Amano as the arbitrator?

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
[MCNAIR'S COUNSEL]: Nothing, Your Honor, in writing
other than what I've already given you. I offered
 
[Plaintiff's Counsel] a letter before the e-mail to DPR,
offering the names of Judge Lim, [sic] Judge Amano -­
THE COURT: Was there any kind of response saying,
yeah, that's okay, I agree?
 
[MCNAIR'S COUNSEL]: Not in writing, but there was
verbally. And that's why I wrote the -­
THE COURT: Well I don't see any indication of that in
your declarations, and that's why I'm asking. That there
 was any kind of an oral response, when it was, what
circumstances were? It's kind of -- it was kind of vague
around that point. And it kind of skipped on the fact that
you proposed Judge Amano and all of a sudden went into these
things that were submitted to DPR.
 
We review the circuit court's denial of the motion to
 
compel arbitration under the same standards that apply to a
 
motion for summary judgment. In Koolau Radiology, Inc. v.
 
Queen's Medical Center, 73 Haw. 433, 834 P.2d 1294 (1992), the
 
Hawai'i Supreme Court established the applicable standards for 
addressing a motion to compel arbitration, as follows:
 
The trial court can only decide, as a matter of law, whether
to compel the parties to arbitrate their dispute if there is
no genuine issue of material fact regarding the existence of
a valid agreement to arbitrate. See Par-Knit Mills, Inc. v.
 
Stockbridge Fabrics Co., 636 F.2d 51, 54 (3d Cir. 1980).
Therefore, we hold that the standard of review applicable to
the trial court's decision in this case should be that which
 is applicable to a motion for summary judgment.
Accordingly, we review this case de novo, using the same
standard employed by the trial court and based upon the same
evidentiary materials "as were before [it] in determination
of the motion." Feliciano v. Waikiki Deep Water, Inc., 69
Haw. 605, 607, 752 P.2d 1076, 1078 (1988) (citation
omitted); see also Cuba v. Fernandez, 71 Haw. 627, 631, 801
 
P.2d 1208, 1211 (1990); First Hawaiian Bank v. Weeks, 70
Haw. 392, 396, 772 P.2d 1187, 1190 (1989).
 
Id. at 439-40, 834 P.2d at 1298; accord Peters v. Aipa, 118
 
Hawai'i 308, 312-13, 188 P.3d 822, 826-27 (App. 2008). 
Based on our review of the current record, there are 
genuine issues of material fact as to the existence of an
 
arbitration agreement. 
On this basis, similar to a summary
 
judgment motion, the circuit court's denial of the motion to
 compel arbitration was proper. However, because we determine
 
that there are genuine issues of material fact, the question

cannot be decided as a matter of law. Therefore, the circuit
 
court's ruling and our instant order do not foreclose the parties
 
or the circuit court from further addressing the issue on a
 
fuller record.2
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Order Denying Defendant
 
Charles McNair's Motion to Compel Arbitration of Plaintiff's
 Claims Against Defendant McNair Under HRS § 431:10C-213.5
 
Pursuant to Agreement" filed on January 7, 2009 in the Circuit
 
Court of the Third Circuit is affirmed.

 HRS § 658A-7(a)(2) (Supp. 2009) provides that "the court shall
proceed summarily to decide the issue" of whether an agreement to arbitrate
exists. Chapter 658A is based on the revised version of the Uniform
Arbitration Act (2000) (RUAA). The comment to section 7 of the RUAA notes
 that the term "summarily" is also in the older version of the Uniform
Arbitration Act and "has been defined to mean that a trial court should act
 expeditiously and without a jury trial to determine whether a valid
arbitration agreement exists." Uniform Arbitration Act § 7 cmt. (2000). An
 evidentiary hearing would therefore be appropriate in this regard.
