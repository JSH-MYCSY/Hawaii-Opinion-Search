IN THE MATTER OF THE TAX APPEAL OF

COMPUSA STORES, L.P., Taxpayer-Appellant v.
STATE OF HAWAI» I, DEPARTMENT OF TAXATION, Appellee

APPEAL FROM THE TAX APPEAL COURT

(CASE NO. 05-0065)

MEMORANDUM OPINION

(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Appellant-Taxpayer CompUSA Stores L.P. (CompUSA) 
appeals from the December 22, 2008 Judgment (Judgment) entered by 
the Hawai» i Tax Appeal Court (Tax Appeal Court)1 against CompUSA 
and in favor of Appellee/Appellee State of Hawai» i, Department of 
Taxation (State).2 
This tax appeal involves the State's imposition of the 
use tax, pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 238-2, on 
tangible personal property shippped from the mainland by CompUSA 
to its Hawai» i retail stores (the Audited Transactions) between 
July 1, 1999 and December 31, 2002 (the Audit Period). CompUSA 
contends that the use tax statute in effect during the Audit 
Period, HRS § 238-2 (2001), does not provide for taxation of the 
Audited Transactions. 
I. BACKGROUND

The following facts apply to the Audit Period. 
 
CompUSA, a Delaware corporation, is a retail seller of

electronics with corporate headquarters in Dallas, Texas. During 
the Audit Period, CompUSA conducted business in Hawai» i through 
two retail stores (Retail Stores), open to the general public, 
and held a Hawai» i general excise tax license in connection 
therewith.3 
CompUSA managed and conducted all purchasing decisions 
at its Dallas headquarters and purchased all inventory sold at 
the Retail Stores from third-party vendors located on the 
mainland. It is undisputed that these sales transactions, from 
third-party vendors to CompUSA, did not subject the third-party 
vendors to the Hawai» i general excise tax. All inventory 
purchased from the mainland vendors and ultimately sold at the Retail Stores was transported from outside Hawai» i via "cross­
dock" or "drop-shipment." 
With regard to cross-dock deliveries, third-party 
vendors delivered the purchased inventory to consolidated centers located outside Hawai» i and owned by CompUSA.
4 Upon arrival to 
the delivery centers, title and risk of loss to the inventory passed from vendor to CompUSA. CompUSA, through various agents 
and sub-agents, then shipped its inventory from the mainland 
consolidation center to its Hawai» i Retail Stores. In drop-
shipment deliveries, inventory was purchased by CompUSA by its 
mainland corporate offices, but vendors directly shipped the 
purchased inventory from the mainland to the Hawai» i Retail 
Stores. As with cross-dock deliveries, title and risk of loss to the inventory passed from the vendor to CompUSA on the mainland.

While the exact date is unclear, CompUSA has since ended all
retail operations in Hawai »i.

During the Audit Period, approximately 97% of the relevant cross-
dock inventory was delivered to a consolidated center in La Palma, California.

During the Audit Period, cross-dock deliveries constituted
approximately 58.6% of the cost of goods delivered to the Retail Stores, while
drop-shipment deliveries accounted for the remaining 41.4%.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In 2003, the State audited CompUSA for unpaid taxes on

transactions which occurred during the Audit Period. On June 9,
 
2004, the State issued notices of final assessment to CompUSA

which imposed $1,099,348.98 in unpaid use tax and $210,223.10 in
 
unpaid interest on the principal amount of the tax. The State

maintained, pursuant to HRS § 238-2, that CompUSA failed to pay

the .5% retail use tax on the Audited Transactions. CompUSA

disputed the imposition of use tax on those transactions.

On July 9, 2004 pursuant to HRS §§ 237-42 and 238-8

(Supp. 2004), CompUSA filed notices of appeal with the Board of

Review for the First Taxation District (Board), requesting a

reassessment of the tax deficiencies articulated in the June 9,

2004 notices of final assessment.  On October 20, 2005, the

Board, at CompUSA's request and pursuant to HRS § 235-114,

transferred the matter to the Tax Appeal Court. 
 
On November 3, 2005, CompUSA also filed a notice of

appeal with the Tax Appeal Court, later amended on November 21,

2005, challenging the imposition of use tax on the Audited

Transactions. 
 
On May 29, 2008, CompUSA moved for summary judgment and

on August 7, 2008, the Department cross-moved for summary

judgment. On November 17, 2008, the Tax Appeal Court held a
 
hearing on the cross-motions, and after entertaining oral

argument, granted the Department's motion and denied CompUSA's

motion. 
 
On December 22, 2008, the Tax Appeal Court entered an

order granting the State's motion for summary judgment, an order

denying CompUSA's motion for summary judgment, and the Judgment

in favor of the State and against CompUSA, in the amount of

$1,099,348.98 in unpaid use tax and $605,988.73 in interest. On

January 21, 2009, CompUSA timely filed a notice of appeal.

II.		POINTS OF ERROR ON APPEAL

Only one point of error is properly before this court 
on appeal. CompUSA contends that the Tax Appeal Court erred when 
it denied CompUSA's motion for summary judgment and granted the 
State's motion for summary judgment because the Audited 
Transactions were not subject to the Hawai» i use tax, pursuant to 
the Hawai» i Supreme Court's decision in In re Tax Appeal of Baker 
& Taylor, Inc. v. Kawafuchi, 103 Hawaii 359, 82 P.3d 804 (2004).6 
III. APPLICABLE STANDARD OF REVIEW

"We review the circuit court's grant or denial of 
summary judgment de novo." Querubin v. Thronas, 107 Hawai» i 48, 
56, 109 P.3d 689, 697 (2005) (quoting Durette v. Aloha Plastic 
Recycling, Inc., 105 Hawai» i 490, 501, 100 P.3d 60, 71 (2004)). 
Likewise, the meaning of a statute is a question of law that is 
reviewed de novo. See, e.g., Sierra Club v. Dep't of Transp. of 
State of Hawai» i, 120 Hawai» i 181, 197, 202 P.3d 1226, 1242 
(2009). 
IV.		DISCUSSION

The use tax is governed by HRS Chapter 238. During the
 
Audit Period, HRS § 238-2 (2001) provided in relevant part:7

§ 238-2. Imposition of tax; exemptions.  There is

hereby levied an excise tax on the use in this State of
tangible personal property which is imported, or purchased
from an unlicensed seller, for use in this State. The tax

imposed by this chapter shall accrue when the property is
acquired by the importer or purchaser and becomes subject to
the taxing jurisdiction of the State. The rates of the tax

hereby imposed and the exemptions thereof are as follows:

(1)		If the importer or purchaser is licensed under
chapter 237 and is: 
 
(A) 	 A wholesaler or jobber importing or
purchasing for purposes of resale; or 
 
6/

As argued by the State, the Tax Appeal Court did not rule on the
additional points of law raised by CompUSA and are beyond the scope of this
appeal.

7/

During the Audit Period, the cited statutory language was not
altered in relevant part. Therefore, when referring to the version of HRS
§ 238-2 in effect during the Audit Period, we reference HRS § 238-2 (2001).

4  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(B) 	 A manufacturer importing or purchasing
material or commodities which are to be

incorporated by the manufacturer into a
finished or saleable product . . . and
which finished or saleable product is to
be sold in such manner as to result in a

further tax on the activity of the
manufacturer as the manufacturer or as a

wholesaler, and not as a retailer, 
 
there shall be no tax; . . .

(2)		If the importer or purchaser is licensed under
chapter 237 and is:

(A) 	 A retailer or other person importing or
purchasing for purposes of resale, not
exempted by paragraph (1); 
 . . . . 
 
the tax shall be one-half of one per cent of the
purchase price of the property, if the purchase
and sale are consummated in Hawaii . . . or if

the purchase or sale is consummated outside of
Hawaii, then one-half of one per cent of the
value of such property . . . .

In conjunction with this provision, HRS § 238-1 (1993 &

Supp. 1999) provides the following definitions:8

§ 238-1. Definitions, generally.  Whenever used in

this chapter, unless otherwise required by the context:

"General excise tax law" means chapter 237, as amended
from time to time.

"Import" (or any nounal, verbal, adverbial, adjective,
or other equivalent of the term) includes importation into
the State from any other part of the United States or its
possessions or from any foreign country, whether in
interstate or foreign commerce or both.

"Property" means tangible personal property . . .

"Purchase" and "sale" means any transfer, exchange, or
barter, conditional or otherwise . . . of tangible personal
property or services for a consideration.

During the Audit Period, the cited statutory definitions were not
altered in any manner relevant to this appeal. Therefore, when referencing to
the version of HRS § 238-1 as drafted during the Audit Period, we are
referring to HRS § 238-1 (1993 & Supp. 1999).

taxes accruing after December 31, 1999, to read:

to the particular sale, is not subject to the tax imposed by
chapter 237, whether or not the seller holds a license under
that chapter, but does not include any seller with respect
to any sale which is expressly exempted from the tax imposed
by chapter 237.

"Use" (and any nounal, verbal, adjectival, adverbial,

The taxpayer in that case, Baker & Taylor, Inc. (Baker), was a

Delaware corporation with its headquarters and principal place of

business in Charlotte, North Carolina, engaged in selling books

to, among others, the Hawai» i State Library. Id.  at 361-62, 82 
P.3d at 806-07. Although not specifically stated in the supreme

court's opinion, the parties in that case stipulated and the

court, without a doubt, understood that Baker was a wholesaler of

books and other educational materials to institutional and

commercial customers.
12 The supreme court's analysis of the use

tax issue was as follows:

The final issue is whether Baker is subject to
Hawaii's use tax. As previously indicated, the use tax
statute, HRS § 238-2, states that '[t]here is hereby levied
an excise tax on the use in this State of tangible personal
property which is imported , or purchased from an unlicensed

seller, for use in this State.' (Emphases added.) The term
'use' under HRS § 238-1 includes 'any use, whether the use
is of such nature as to cause the property to be appreciably
consumed or not, or the keeping of the property for such use
or for sale, and shall include the exercise of any right or
power over tangible personal property incident to the
ownership of that property[.]'

Baker argues that inasmuch as it was stipulated that
title passed on the mainland, Baker did not own the goodswhen they arrived in Hawai
»i. Accordingly, Baker argues it is
not subject to the use tax. On the other hand, theDepartment imposed the use tax on Baker on the bases that
(a) Baker imported tangible personal property into Hawai
»i 
for resale pursuant to HRS § 238-2(2) and (b) Baker 'used'
personal property as defined in HRS § 238-1 when it directeddelivery of the purchased goods to Hawai
»i customers. 
'Where the language of a statute is plain and
unambiguous, our only duty is to give effect to thestatute's plain and obvious meaning.' Iddings v. Mee-Lee , 82
Hawai
»i 1, 7, 919 P.2d 263, 269 (1996). According to HRS
§ 238-1, 'imported' FN21 'includes importation into the State
from any other part of the United States or its possessionsor from any foreign country, whether in interstate orforeign commerce, or both.' 'Purchase' is defined as 'any 
12/ In footnote 7 of the Baker & Taylor  case, the supreme court noted
that Baker and the State had filed a stipulation of facts in the tax appeal
court. Baker & Taylor , 103 Hawai »i at 361 n.7, 82 P.3d at 806 n.7. The 
stipulation of facts included the fact that Baker was one of the largest
wholesalers of books in the world, with distribution centers in 13 states (but
not Hawai »i) and international sales offices in Australia and Japan. In the
case now before us, the Baker & Taylor  stipulation was submitted to the Tax
Appeal Court, without objection, in conjunction with the summary judgment
motions.

transfer, exchange, or barter, conditional or otherwise, in
any manner or by any means, wheresoever consummated, of
tangible personal property for a consideration.' HRS
§ 238-1. The sale of books was directly from Baker to the
Library. Therefore Baker did not import the books from an
unlicensed seller. Furthermore, Baker did not purchase the
books and 'resell' the goods to the Library. Under the
circumstances of this case Baker could not import from
itself or purchase from itself. Therefore, Baker is not
subject to the use tax under the plain language of HRS
§ 238-1.

FN21. Although the statute defines the word
'import,' there is a parenthetical qualifier
directly after 'import' which states, '(or any
nounal, verbal, adverbial, adjective, or other
equivalent of the term)'. Therefore, the
definition for 'import' would be equivalent to
'imported.'

Although the Director is concerned with the imposition
of a uniform tax burden, the taxing burden is not at issue
here. As HRS § 238-2 deals with the imposition of a tax on
the 'use in this State of tangible personal property[,]' it
is inapplicable. The Director's reliance on In Re Tax Appeal
of Habilitat, 65 Haw. 199, 649 P.2d 1126 (1982), is
inapposite. Habilitat, a not-for-profit organization in
Hawai
»i, advertised the availability of mainland products to
Hawai»i consumers. Consumers placed orders with Habilitat and
Habilitat would have the mainland supplier ship the products
directly to the Hawai
»i consumer. The organization argued
that it never possessed or used the property so it should
not be assessed use taxes. This court disagreed, stating
that the definition of use in HRS § 238-1 included 'the
exercise of any right or power over tangible personal
property incident to the ownership of that property.' Id.  at

210, 649 P.2d at 1134. Since the organization had the power
to order the mainland supplier to ship the goods to the
consumer, the court found sufficient 'right or power over
the tangible personal property' to impose the use tax. Id.
In contrast, Baker did not direct a third party supplier to
ship the books to the Library. Rather, Baker itself was the
supplier.

Baker & Taylor, 103 Hawai» i at 372-73, 82 P.3d at 817-18. 
In applying the plain language of HRS § 238-1 and

§ 238-2 (1993), the supreme court held that Baker was not subject

to the use tax. Id. The court first noted that, in order for

§ 238-2 to be triggered, a taxpayer must "import" or "purchase"

tangible personal property from an "unlicensed seller." Id.

Within this context, the court reasoned that Baker, not a third-
party, was the mainland supplier of the books  therefore, Baker
 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
As noted above, an "unlicensed seller," for purposes of the13/
Chapter 238 use tax, is generally defined as a seller, who with respect to the
particular transaction, is not subject to the Chapter 237 general excise tax. 
See HRS 238-1 (1993).  Baker, on the other hand, was subject to the Chapter
237 general excise tax.  Baker, 103 Hawai# i at 367, 82 P.3d at 812.
9did not "import" the books from an "unlicensed seller.13"  Id. 
The court also expressly observed that Baker did not "purchase
the books and 'resell' the goods to the Library" – thus, the
court concluded that Baker could not "purchase from itself."  Id. 
With these principles in mind, the court excluded the subject
transactions from the use tax.  Id.   When it was enacted, and as
interpreted by the supreme court, the use tax law was established
for the purpose of taxing "the value of goods purchased directly
from non-licensed sellers and brought into the State for resale." 
Senate Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 6, 1965 Senate Journal, at 814.  In
essence, Baker successfully availed itself of a loophole in the
use tax law by shipping goods it already owned to Hawai #i, rather
than goods purchased directly from non-licensed mainland sellers.
In response to the Baker & Taylor decision, the
Legislature immediately passed amendments to HRS §§ 238-1 and
238-2 to close this loophole.  See 2004 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 114,
§ 1 at 431.  Act 114 of 2004 expressly amended HRS §§ 238-1 and
238-2, and explained its purpose as follows:
SECTION 1.  The purpose of this Act is to clarify
current use tax laws in light of Baker & Taylor, Inc. v.
Kawafuchi, S.C. 23376 (Jan. 14, 2004) and administrative
rule 18-237-13-02.01 by:
(1) Clarifying when a seller is subject to the 0.5 per
cent use tax;
(2) Restoring the imposition of taxes on goods purchased
both within and outside the State; and
(3) Clarifying that the use tax applies to sellers
who acquire goods from outside the State and
import the product for sale or resale in the
State.
Id.  While described as clarifications, the amendments clearly
modified the prior version of the statute as it was interpreted NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
by the Hawai» i Supreme Court in Baker & Taylor . See 2004 Haw. 
14
Sess. Laws Act 114, §ÿÿ 2 & 3 at 431-35.
 
In this case, as in Baker & Taylor , there was no 
purchase or importation from an unlicensed seller because CompUSA 
itself was the supplier. The State argues that CompUSA 
necessarily purchased its goods from unlicensed vendors such as 
Apple, HP, Belkin, Palm, etc. However, so did Baker, which was 
stipulated to be a book wholesaler, not a publisher or 
manufacturer. CompUSA, like Baker, completed its third-party 
purchase transactions on the mainland and then shipped the goods 
to Hawai» i. CompUSA, like Baker, sold goods it owned to its 
customers in Hawai» i. The supreme court, in Baker & Taylor , 
treated this transaction as an initial sale of the taxpayer's 
goods, rather than a resale of goods purchased from an unlicensed 
third-party vendor. We must apply the same analysis in this 
case. Like the taxpayer in Baker & Taylor , CompUSA could not be 
said to have imported or purchased goods from itself, and 
therefore was not liable for payment of the use tax under the law 
in effect during the Audit Period. 
Finally, the State urges us to accord persuasive weight 
to the administrative rules promulgated to carry out the purpose 
of HRS Chapter 238. However, we are bound by the supreme court's 
interpretation of the statute and, as the court noted in Baker & 
Taylor, the administrative rule cannot contradict the statute. 
Baker & Taylor , 103 Hawai» i at 64 n.14, 82 P.3d at 809 n.14; see 
also, e.g., Coon v. City and County of Honolulu, 98 Hawai» i 233, 
251, 47 P.3d 348, 366 (2002) (stating that "it is axiomatic that 
an administrative rule cannot contradict or conflict with the 
statute it attempts to implement"). Therefore, we need not 
examine whether the administrative rule in effect in 2004 was 
14/

As the State reiterated in its answering brief, the State never
took the position that CompUSA was subject to taxation pursuant to 2004
amendments. Therefore, we do not address CompUSA's arguments concerning the
use tax statute, as amended.

10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
consistent or inconsistent with the supreme court's

interpretation.

V. CONCLUSION

For these reasons, we conclude that the Tax Appeal 
Court erred when it denied CompUSA's motion for summary judgment 
and granted the State's motion for summary judgment because the 
Audited Transactions were not subject to the Hawai» i use tax. 
Accordingly, we vacate the Tax Appeal Court's December 22, 2008 Judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this 
Memorandum Opinion.
