STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
NELSON K. NII, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 06-1-1305)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Nelson K. Nii (Nii) appeals from
 
the Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence filed on
 
January 7, 2009 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit1
 
(circuit court). A jury found Nii guilty of Promoting a
 Dangerous Drug in the Third Degree, in violation of Hawaii
 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 712-1243 (Supp. 2010), and Unlawful Use
 
of Drug Paraphernalia, in violation of HRS § 329-43.5 (1993).
 
On appeal, Nii contends the circuit court erred when 
it

(1) denied his Motion to Suppress Evidence,  filed
November 6, 2006, because there was no showing of the reliability
 
of the confidential informant (CI) and no opportunity to
 
challenge the sufficiency of evidence in the sealed affidavit,
 
therefore violating his constitutional rights;
 
(2) found that Nii's June 20, 2006 warrantless arrest

 
was lawful where the language of the search warrant was overbroad
 
and vague, making it a constitutionally impermissible "general
 
warrant";
 
(3) found that the June 20, 2006 search of Nii's
 
residence was lawful; and
 
(4) denied his "Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Rule 48, 
Hawai'i Rules of Penal Procedure [HRPP], and the Constitutional 
Right to a Speedy Trial" (Motion to Dismiss), filed on September 16, 2008, because the court's denial violated HRPP Rule 
48 and his right to a speedy trial. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Nii's
 
points of error as follows:
 
(1) Under the United States and Hawai
'i Constitutions, 
all arrests and warrants must be based on probable cause. The 
State of Hawai 'i (State) has the burden of showing there was 
probable cause for the arrest. State v. Crowder, 1 Haw. App. 60, 
613 P.2d 909, 913 (1980). "Probable cause exists when the facts 
and circumstances within one's knowledge and of which one has 
reasonably trustworthy information are sufficient in themselves 
to warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe that an 
2
 On October 30, 2006, Nii's co-defendant, Ilona Miller filed a Motion
to Suppress Evidence. On November 1, 2006, another co-defendant, Clifton Nii
filed a Motion to Suppress Evidence. On November 6, 2006, Nii filed a
"Joinder in Defendant Ilona Miller's Motion to Suppress Evidence and Motion to
Compel Discovery and [Nii's] Motion to Suppress Evidence." The circuit court
 considered the three motions together, and we will refer to the three motions
collectively as "Defendants' Motion to Suppress."

offense has been committed." State v. Navas, 81 Hawai 'i 113, 
116, 913 P.2d 39, 42 (1996). 
The crucial consideration, according to the Hawai 'i 
Supreme Court, in testing the sufficiency of the affidavit with 
regards to probable cause based on CI information is "whether the 
affidavit sets forth facts to show that the affiant is justified 
in believing the informer's allegations of criminal activity." 
State v. Austria, 55 Haw. 565, 569, 524 P.2d 290, 293 (1974). 
"In order for a finding of probable cause to be sustained, . . . 
the affidavit must set out some of the underlying circumstances 
from which the informant concluded that the illegal activity was 
taking place, as well as some of the underlying circumstances 
from which the police officer concluded that the informant was 
credible." State v. Kaukani, 59 Haw. 120, 123, 577 P.2d 335, 338 
(1978) (citing to standards established by the United States Supreme Court in Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108, 114, 84 S. Ct. 
1509, 1514 (1964)). 
The record is replete with evidence establishing
 
probable cause and reliability of the CI. Officer Marumoto
 
testified that he had been working with the CI for about six
 
months and two other search warrants had been issued based on
 
information from the CI. Officer Marumoto also explained the
 
procedure used in the investigation, providing details as to why
 
Nii's residence was under surveillance and how the "buys" were
 
monitored. The testimony given by Officer Marumoto clearly
 
indicated probable cause for the District Court of the First
 
Circuit to issue a search warrant.
 
More importantly, despite the circuit court's order
 
that the affidavit in support of the search warrant remained
 
sealed, a redacted copy of the affidavit was filed on May 29,
 
2007 as Exhibit B to the Honolulu Police Department's Motion to
 
Quash Subpoena Duces Tecum, or, in the Alternative, for an In-
Camera Inspection and served on Nii's counsel on May 25, 2007. 
The unredacted information in the affidavit included the range of
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
dates in which "buys" were made, the number of buys made, the
 
procedures that were followed in conducting the buys, and reasons
 
for using the CI and suspecting the illegal activities at the
 
house.
 
The redacted affidavit and Officer Marumoto's testimony
 
contradict Nii's contention that there was "no evidence in the
 
record as to why the police considered the [CI] in this case
 
reliable or of any steps they took to verify the [CI's]
 
reliability prior to conduct[ing] the search." Therefore, Nii's
 
contention that lack of access to the sealed affidavit resulted
 
in a denial of his constitutional rights lacks merit. The
 
circuit court did not abuse its discretion when it ordered the
 
identity of the CI to remain confidential.
 
(2) In State v. Iwatate, 108 Hawai 'i 361, 369, 120 
P.3d 260, 268 (App. 2005), this court held:
 
A determination on whether a search warrant complies
with constitutional particularity requirements must be made
"on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all of the
surrounding facts and circumstances." State v. Kealoha, 62
Haw. 166, 170-71, 613 P.2d 645, 648 (1980). The cornerstone
 
of such a determination is the language of the warrant
itself. Id. at 171, 613 P.2d at 648.
 
Id. at 369, 120 P.3d at 268 (quoting State v. Matsunaga, 82 
Hawai'i 162, 167, 920 P.2d 376, 381 (App. 1996)). 
In evaluating the language of the search warrant, we
 
consider "(1) the breadth of the warrant's apparent scope, (2)
 
whether its execution would impinge upon vital rights and
 
interests such as the right to privacy, and (3) whether the
 
complexity and magnitude of the criminal activity being
 
investigated would render a more particularized description of
 
seizable articles difficult." State v. Kealoha, 62 Haw. 166,
 
171, 613 P.2d 645, 648 (1980).
 
The search warrant took general language and
 
particularized it when it described any "closed containers . . .
 [in which] narcotics paraphernalia . . . may be stored" and
 
limited the search of "articles of personal property" to that
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
"tending to establish the identity of persons in control of . . .
 
containers . . . where controlled substances may be found." See
 
Kealoha, 62 Haw. at 173-74, 613 P.2d at 649-50 (citing cases
 where "broad general descriptions of the articles were
 
particularized by specific examples" sufficient to avoid being
 
unconstitutional general warrants).
 
The facts show that the ice pipe in the "cloth pouch"
 
and Nii's driver's license were found in close proximity to one
 
another under the couch cushion near where Nii was sitting.
 
Contrary to Nii's assertion that he was not behaving
 
suspiciously, the circumstances created a reasonable suspicion
 
that the items belonged to Nii and he was attempting to conceal
 
them.
 
The police were acting under a valid search warrant
 
that allowed for the search of "any and all closed containers" on
 
the premises that might contain methamphetamine paraphernalia. A
 
police sergeant found a "cloth pouch containing a glass pipe
 
[with] a white residue substance resembling methamphetamine under
 
the cushion of the sofa where [Nii] was seated." Based on his
 
training and experience, Officer Marumoto testified that he
 
recognized the bulbous shape of a methamphetamine pipe. The
 
search warrant authorized the officers to reach inside the pouch
 
and pull out the pipe. Given the close proximity between the
 
pipe in the pouch and Nii's wallet with his identification, the
 
police had probable cause to place Nii under arrest.
 
(3) The search warrant authorized the police to search
 
the "premises and curtilage of [Nii's residence]" and "[a]ny and
 
all closed containers located in or on the above-mentioned
 
premises . . . [f]or the following property":
 
1.	 Methamphetamine and narcotics paraphernalia commonly
associated with the storage, use and sale of
Methamphetamine consisting of and including, but not
limited to bowl pipes[.]
 . . . .
 
3.	 Articles of personal property tending to establish the
identity of persons in control of premises, vehicle,
containers, storage areas, and/or property where
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
controlled substances may be found, consisting of, and
including but not limited to personal
identification[.]
 
The warrant was sufficiently limited in its scope, 
clearly identifying the residence and authorizing the search of 
only those closed containers of the kind in which 
"[m]ethamphetamine and narcotics paraphernalia commonly 
associated with the storage, use and sale of [m]ethamphetamine 
. . . may be stored or concealed." The Hawai 'i Supreme Court has 
determined that "[i]n view of the easy mobility of [narcotics], a warrant specifying the particular premises within which it is 
hidden is sufficiently detailed to satisfy the constitutional 
requirement that a warrant particularly (describe) the place to 
be searched." State v. Davenport, 55 Haw. 90, 100, 516 P.2d 65, 
72 (1973) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Therefore, the circuit court did not err in ruling that the 
search of Nii's residence was lawful. 
(4) HRPP Rule 48(b)(1) mandates the dismissal of a 
charge unless trial is commenced within six months from the time 
of arrest or the filing of the charges, whichever occurs first. 
Six months is "construed as one hundred eighty days." State v. 
Jackson, 81 Hawai
'i 39, 50, 912 P.2d 71, 82 (1996). 
Pursuant to HRPP Rule 48(c) & (d), certain periods of 
delay are excluded from the computation of the 180-day time limit. State v. Samonte, 83 Hawai
'i 507, 514, 928 P.2d 1, 8 
(1996). Also, "to be excludable under HRPP [Rule] 48(c), a time period must actually delay a defendant's trial." State v. Hoey, 
77 Hawai
'i 17, 29, 881 P.2d 504, 516 (1994). 
Rule 48 provides, in relevant part:
 
(c) Excluded periods.  The following periods shall
be excluded in computing the time for trial commencement:
 
(1) periods that delay the commencement of trial
and are caused by collateral or other proceedings
concerning the defendant, including but not limited to
penal irresponsibility examinations and periods during
which the defendant is incompetent to stand trial,
pretrial motions, interlocutory appeals and trials of
other charges;
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
. . . .
 
(3) periods that delay the commencement of trial
and are caused by a continuance granted at the request
or with the consent of the defendant or defendant's
 counsel;
 
(4) periods that delay the commencement of trial
and are caused by a continuance granted at the request
of the prosecutor if:
 
(i) the continuance is granted because of
the unavailability of evidence material to the
prosecution's case, when the prosecutor has
exercised due diligence to obtain such evidence
and there are reasonable grounds to believe that
such evidence will be available at a later date;
 
. . . .
 
(8) other periods of delay for good cause.
 
(d) Per se excludable and includable periods of time
for purposes of subsection (c)(1) of this rule.
 
(1) For purposes of subsection (c)(1) of this
rule, the period of time, from the filing through the
prompt disposition of the following motions filed by a
defendant, shall be deemed to be periods of delay
resulting from collateral or other proceedings
concerning the defendant: motions to dismiss, to
suppress, for voluntariness hearing heard before
trial, to sever counts or defendants, for
disqualification of the prosecutor, for withdrawal of
counsel including the time period for appointment of
new counsel if so ordered, for mental examination, to
continue trial, for transfer to the circuit court, for
remand from the circuit court, for change of venue, to
secure the attendance of a witness by a material
witness order, and to secure the attendance of a
witness from without the state.
 
(Emphases added.)
 
Nii claims as many as 263 days were non-excludable and
 
should have been charged to the State for Rule 48 purposes. Nii
 
was arrested on June 20, 2006; the State filed the complaint on
 
June 28, 2006; and the jury trial commenced on October 21, 2008 
-- a total of 853 days from arrest to the commencement of trial. 
In its "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and
 
Order Denying [Nii's] Motion to Dismiss for Violation of HRPP
 
Rule 48 or Speedy Trial," the circuit court found that 89 days
 
were chargeable to the State, well within the 180-day time limit
 
between arrest and commencement of trial, and made the following
 
7
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, identifying the start
 
date and excludable periods:
 
FINDINGS OF FACT
 
1. The following time should be charged to the
State for HRPP Rule 48 purposes:
 
a. Eighty-three (83) days to include the time
between arrest on June 20, 2006 and the firsttrial setting on September 11, 2006. 
b. Six (6) days to include the time between thedisposition of [Defendants' Motion to Suppress]and the next trial setting. 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 
. . . .
 
3. The excludable periods applicable to the instant
case are periods that delay the commencement of trial and
are caused by collateral or other proceedings concerning the
defendant such as motions to suppress. See HRPP Rule
 
48(c)(1) and (d)(2).
 
4. Also excludable is a "reasonable period of delay
when the defendant is joined for trial with a codefendant as
to whom the time for trial has not run and there is good
cause for not granting a severance. See HRPP Rule 48(c)(7).
 
5. In the instant case, with the exception of the
time noted in this Court's Findings of Fact, the time that
has elapsed since Defendants' arrest on June 20, 2006 shall
be excluded from the six months the State has to commence
 trial pursuant to HRPP Rule 48(c)(1), (c)(7), and (d)(2).
 
There were numerous delays caused by continuances
 
related to Defendants' Motion to Suppress. The period of time
 
from the filing of the pretrial motion to suppress through its
 
"prompt disposition" is per se excludable under Rule 48(d)(1). 
Nii maintains that Rule 48 was violated when Defendants' Motion
 
to Suppress was not promptly disposed of due to negligence by the
 
State in failing to provide the necessary witnesses.
 
Nii claims several time periods were chargeable to the
 
State under Rule 48. We dispose of his claims as follows:
 
(a) June 20, 2006 to September 11, 2006 (83 days).3
 
The parties agreed this time period was chargeable to the State.
 
3
 Nii incorrectly counts this as 84 days.
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(b) October 2, 2006 to November 6, 2006 (35 days).4
 
During this time period, the circuit court had already set the
 
trial week for December 4, 2006. This time period was excludable
 
because prior to October 2006, the circuit court had continued
 
the trial to the week of December 4, 2006 at Nii's request. 
Nii's filing of his individual Motion to Suppress Evidence on
 
November 6, 2006 had no effect on the tolling of time because
 
that period of time was already excludable. 
(c) October 25, 2007 to December 3, 2007 (39 days).5
 
On September 27, 2007, the parties agreed to continue the trial
 
to the week of December 3, 2007. Thus, this period of time was
 
excludable under Rule 48(c)(3) ("The following periods shall be
 
excluded . . .: (3) periods that delay the commencement of trial
 
and are caused by a continuance granted . . . with the consent of
 
the defendant[.]"). Because the parties had already agreed to
 
the trial continuance to December 3, 2007, the interim hearing on
 
October 25, 2007, in which the Defendants' Motion to Suppress was
 
granted pending the State filing a motion for reconsideration,
 
had no effect on the time computation.
 
(d) January 25, 2008 to February 21, 2008 (27 days).6
 
As a result of some interim hearings, the new trial week was set
 
for March 24, 2008, with no objection in the record by Nii. 
Again, any motions and hearings before March 24, 2008 had no
 
effect on the computation of time, as that period was already
 
excludable. Therefore, the February 21, 2008 hearing on the
 
State's February 4, 2008 "Motion to Reconsider Order Granting
 
[Defendants'] Motion to Suppress Evidence" does not affect the
 
excludable time period.
 
4
 Nii incorrectly counts this as 34 days.
 
5
 Nii adds 40 days rather than the correct 39 days.
 
6
 Nii incorrectly counts this as 28 days.
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(e) July 8, 2008 to July 21, 2008 (13 days).
 
At trial call on July 3, 2008, the circuit court set a new trial 
week of August 18, 2008. Nii "waived Rule 48 and speedy trial." 
In its "Memorandum in Opposition to [Nii's] Motion to Dismiss for 
HRPP Rule 48 Violation and/or Speedy Trial," the State argued 
that the time from the filing of the circuit court's written 
"Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Denying 
[Defendants'] Motion to Suppress Evidence" on July 8, 2008 to the 
proposed trial date of July 14, 2008 should be charged to the 
State, and the circuit court so found. Nii claims that the time 
charged to the State should be extended to July 21, 2008. 
However, he provides no argument to support his contention. 
Points not argued may be deemed waived. Hawai 'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(7). Even if Nii were right, the additional seven days would not change the conclusion that the 
180-day time limit was not violated. 
(f) August 18, 2008 to October 20, 2008 (63 days).
7
 
Nii argues that the time from August 18, 2008 when the
 
trial date was again continued, to October 20, 2008 when the
 trial began, should be charged to the State. At the August 14,
 
2008 trial call, Nii objected to the continuance requested by a
 
co-defendant's attorney, who was newly-appointed as of August 12,
 
2008. However, excluded periods include the period of time for
 
appointment of new counsel. HRPP Rule 48(d)(1). An excluded
 
period includes "a reasonable period of delay when the defendant
 
is joined for trial with a codefendant as to whom the time for
 
trial has not run and there is good cause for not granting a
 
severance[.]" HRPP Rule 48(c)(7).
 
The circuit court did not err when it found that 89
 
days were chargeable to the State, well within the 180-day time
 
frame allowed to bring a case to trial under HRPP Rule 48.
 
Therefore,
 
7
 Nii incorrectly counts this as 64 days.
