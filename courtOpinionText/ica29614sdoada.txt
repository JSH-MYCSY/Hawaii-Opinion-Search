APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(S.P.P. NO. 08-1-0012(2) (Cr. No. 88-0058(2))
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
Petitioner-Appellant Dale Mark Fetalvero (Fetalvero)
appeals from the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and
Judgment Denying Rule 40 Petition for Post-Conviction Relief
filed on January 20, 2009 in the Circuit Court of the Second
Circuit (circuit court).1
On July 7, 1989, the circuit court convicted Fetalvero 
of Kidnapping, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
§ 707-720 (1976); Rape in the First Degree, in violation of HRS
§ 707-730 (1985) (§ 707-730 was repealed in 1986); and Murder, in
violation of HRS § 707-701 (1976).
On July 23, 1990, the Hawai# i Supreme Court affirmed
Fetalvero's convictions in No. 14013. 
On August 17, 1993, Fetalvero filed a Petition for
Post-Conviction Relief, pursuant to Rule 40 of the Hawaii Rules
of Penal Procedure (HRPP) (First Petition).  The circuit court
denied the First Petition on November 17, 1993.  Fetalvero did
not appeal the denial of the First Petition.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2On July 21, 2008, Fetalvero filed a Petition for Post-
Conviction Relief, pursuant to HRPP Rule 40 (Second Petition). 
In the Second Petition, Fetalvero asserted that:
A. Ground one: Petitioner was denied the fundamental
right to a jury trial In violation of Art.
1, § 2, 5, 10, 14 of the Haw. Const. And
U.S. const. 6 Amend.
. . . .
Petitioner did not waived his right to a jury trial
and was therefore denied and subsequently userped his
fundamental right to a jury trial
B. Ground two: The sentence of petitioner is illegal as
there were only Multiple terms impose at
the same time which by statute HRS § 706-
668.5 runs concurrent.
. . . . 
The sentencing court sentenced the petitioner to 3
consecutive terms of life/w parole and 5 years each
mandatory terms of imprisonment.  Under current and
prior laws consecutive and mandatory sentencing were
illegal.
C. Ground three:  Petitioner's extended terms of
imprisonment is illegal on its face, as deemed by
Hawai#i Supreme Court.
. . . .
Unconstitutional challenge to prior sentencing statute
is deemed illegal and has no force and effect Ab
initio and void.
D. Ground four:  The priciple charge of the crimes was
Kidnapping and murder cannot be a secondary or third
part of the serious offense.
. . . .
The charges are erroneous because the fist [sic]
charge is Kidnapping and not murder there is no degree
of murder i.e 1stB  2ndB murder What? its defective and
should be thrown out. 
On January 20, 2009, the circuit court issued its
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Judgment Denying Rule
40 Petition for Post-Conviction Relief, denying the Second
Petition without a hearing.  The circuit court concluded that
Ground One had been previously ruled upon; Grounds Two and Four
had no colorable basis, were patently frivolous, and were withoutNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
  Although Fetalvero states that the circuit court sentenced him2
pursuant to HRS § 706-606.5 (Sentencing of Repeat Offenders), the circuit
court actually sentenced him pursuant to HRS § 706-606.  The circuit court did
not sentence Fetalvero as a repeat offender.
3a trace of support in the record; and Ground Three had been
waived.
On appeal, Fetalvero's only point of error is that his
consecutive sentences were illegal pursuant to HRS §§ 706-668.5
(1993) and 706-606 (1993).2  Fetalvero vaguely alleges that the
indictment should have put him on notice that he could receive
consecutive sentences.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude that 
Fetalvero's appeal is without merit.
HRPP "Rule 40 proceedings shall not be available and
relief thereunder shall not be granted where the issues sought to
be raised have been previously ruled upon or were waived."  HRPP
Rule 40(a)(3).  Furthermore, imposition of consecutive sentences
upon Fetalvero did not violate his constitutional rights.  State
