APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
HONOLULU DIVISION
(CRIMINAL CASE NO. 1P107-20948)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
In this consolidated appeal, Defendants-Appellants Chen
Hua Hso Kona (Kona) and On Muk Cabral (Cabral) appeal from the
respective notices of entry of judgment and/or orders (Judgments)
filed on January 7, 2009 in the District Court of the First
Circuit, Honolulu Division (district court).1  
Kona and Cabral were convicted of Prostitution, in
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 712-1200(1) (1993).  Kona
filed a notice of appeal on February 9, 2009, which was docketed
as appeal no. 29621.  Cabral filed a notice of appeal on June 26,
2009, which was docketed as appeal no. 29909.  The parties
stipulated to consolidation of the two appeals, and an order of
consolidation was issued on July 14, 2009.
On appeal, Kona and Cabral contend that (1) there was
insufficient evidence to convict them of prostitution and (2)NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
2they did not knowingly and intelligently waive their right to
testify because the district court failed to conduct an adequate
colloquy required by State v. Tachibana, 79 Hawai# i 226, 900 P.2d
1293 (1995).
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Kona's and Cabral's points of error as follows:
 There was insufficient evidence to convict Kona or
Cabral of prostitution.  See State v. Xiao, No. 28370, 2010 WL
2106494 (Haw. May 25, 2010).  Because there was insufficient
evidence to convict, we need not address the remaining point of
error.
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgments filed on
January 7, 2009 in the District Court of the First Circuit,
Honolulu Division, are reversed. 
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai #i, June 29, 2010.
