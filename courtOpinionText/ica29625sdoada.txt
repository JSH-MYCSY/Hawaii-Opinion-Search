  The Honorable Steven S. Alm presided.1NO. 29625
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
CHRISTOPHER A. PHANPRADITH, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CR. NO. 06-1-0310)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Christopher A. Phanpradith
(Phanpradith) appeals from the Judgment of Conviction and
Sentence filed on January 20, 2009 in the Circuit Court of the
First Circuit (circuit court).1  A jury convicted Phanpradith of
one count of Sexual Assault in the First Degree, in violation of
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 707-730 (Supp. 2005) and two
counts of Sexual Assault in the Third Degree, in violation of HRS
ยง 707-732 (Supp. 2008).
On appeal, Phanpradith contends that (1) with respect
to the charge of Sexual Assault in the First Degree, the circuit
court erred by not instructing the jury on the included offense
of Sexual Assault in the Third Degree and (2) there was
insufficient evidence to convict him.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Phanpradith's points of error as follows:
(1)  Even if the circuit court erred by failing to
instruct the jury on Sexual Assault in the Third Degree, it was
harmless error because the jury convicted Phanpradith of aNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2greater offense.  State v. Haanio, 94 Hawai# i 405, 415-16, 16
P.3d 246, 256-57 (2001).
(2) Considering the evidence adduced at trial in the
strongest light in favor of the prosecution, there was
substantial evidence of each element of sufficient quality and
probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to
support a conclusion that Phanpradith was guilty of one count of
Sexual Assault in the First Degree and two counts of Sexual
Assault in the Third Degree.  State v. Richie, 88 Hawai #i 19, 33,
960 P.2d 1227, 1241 (1998).  This court will not set aside
verdicts based on conflicting evidence where there is substantial
evidence to support the jury's findings.  State v. Mattiello, 90
Hawai#i 255, 259, 978 P.2d 693, 697 (1999). 
Therefore, 
The Judgment of Conviction and Sentence filed on
January 20, 2009 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is
affirmed.
