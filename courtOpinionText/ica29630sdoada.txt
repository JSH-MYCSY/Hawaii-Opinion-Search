SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.) 
In this secondary appeal from an administrative agency 
matter, Plaintiff-Appellant AlohaCare (AlohaCare) appeals from a 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court)1 judgment 
entered on January 8, 2009 in favor of Defendant-Appellee 
Department of Human Services, State of Hawai» i (DHS). 
AlohaCare's appeal arises from an October 2007 DHS 
request for proposals for managed care plans for which AlohaCare 
submitted a bid but was not selected. AlohaCare lodged a protest 
with the head of the purchasing agency pursuant to Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) § 103F-501 (Supp. 2010),2 then requested

 HRS § 103F-501 provides, in relevant part:
 
Protested awards. (a) A person who is aggrieved by an
award of a contract may protest a purchasing agency's

reconsideration from the Chief Procurement Officer pursuant to
 
HRS § 103F-502 (Supp. 2010),3 then appealed to the Department of
 
Commerce and Consumer Affairs (DCCA) for administrative review
 
citing HRS § 103D-709 (Supp. 2010).4 The DCCA dismissed
 
AlohaCare's appeal for lack of jurisdiction. AlohaCare appealed
 
from the DCCA's dismissal order to the circuit court, citing HRS
 
ÿÿ 91-14(a) (1993) and HRS ÿÿ 103D-710 (Supp. 2010). The circuit
 
court also dismissed the appeal for lack of subject matter
 
jurisdiction.

On appeal from the circuit court's order and judgment, 
AlohaCare argues that circuit court erred (1) in ruling that the 
procurement regulations outlined in HRS chapters 103F and 103D do 
not provide for judicial review of DHS procurement decisions; (2) 
in determining that HRS chapter 103F is constitutional under 
article VI, section 1 of the Hawai» i Constitution; and (3) in 
determining that HRS chapter 103F is constitutional under 
article I, section 5 of the Hawai» i Constitution. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted, and having given due consideration to the arguments
 
advanced and the issues raised, as well as the relevant law, we
 
resolve AlohaCare's appeal as follows:
 
(1) & (2) AlohaCare's first and second points on 
appeal, that HRS chapter 103F, which governs health and human 
services procurement, does not preclude judicial review of 
procurement decisions, and the absence of judicial review in HRS 
chapter 103F violates article VI, section 1 of the Hawai» i 
Constitution, have been resolved against it by Alaka» i Na Keiki, 
Inc. v. Hamamoto, No. 29742, ___ Hawai» i ___, ___ P.3d ___, 2011 
WL 2002224 (App. May 24, 2011). 
(3) HRS chapter 103F's review process does not raise 
due process or equal protection concerns. To the extent 
AlohaCare claims it was denied due process by the lack of 
judicial review, that argument was also rejected in Alaka» i Na 
Keiki, id. at *6. 
Finally, we reject AlohaCare's argument that HRS
 
chapter 103F's review process for aggrieved bidders violates
 equal protection principles because the absence of judicial
 
review "would have [a] much greater detrimental effect on the
 
person receiving services." AlohaCare does not have standing to
 
raise the claims of health and human services recipients. 
Generally, "[c]onstitutional rights may not be vicariously
 
asserted." Kaneohe Bay Cruises, Inc. v. Hirata , 75 Haw. 250,
 
265, 861 P.2d 1, 9 (1993) (internal quotation marks and citation
 
omitted). AlohaCare is not a recipient of the state's health and
 
3

human services. Therefore, it cannot raise an equal protection
 
claim that chapter 103F's review process detrimentally affects
 
that class of individuals. Id. To the extent AlohaCare asserts
 
its own right to equal protection based on the lack of judicial
 
review for bidders under HRS chapter 103F, it presents no cogent
 
argument in support of this claim and we reject it.
 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Circuit Court of the
 
First Circuit's January 8, 2009 judgment and order dismissing
 
AlohaCare's appeal for lack of jurisdiction is affirmed.
