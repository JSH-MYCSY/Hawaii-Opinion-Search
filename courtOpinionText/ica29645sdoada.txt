APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 05-1-0116(2))
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
Defendants-Appellants John D. Oliver (John),
Individually and in his Capacity as Trustee Under the Oliver
Revocable Living Trust, dated March 23, 2004, and Mahealani
Ventura-Oliver (Mahealani), Individually and in her Capacity as
Trustee Under the Oliver Revocable Living Trust, dated March 23, The Honorable Rhonda I.L. Loo presided.1
22004, (collectively, the Olivers) appeal from the Judgment for
Possession and Writ of Possession, both filed on February 12,
2009 in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (circuit court).1
On appeal, the Olivers contend:
(a) "The lower court erred by 1) granting a judgment
for the [Plaintiffs-Appellees Koolau Cattle Company, LLC (Koolau
Cattle), Betsill Brothers Construction, Inc., Randall J. Betsill,
Doyle Betsill, and Dwayne Betsill (collectively, Plaintiffs)] to
foreclose on the [Olivers' home (the Property)] then four months
later granted a motion to amend that judgment on a terminated
case[;] 2) confirming a 'sale' of the [Property] without a
sale[;] and 3) granting judgment of possession and writ of
possession to [Plaintiffs] to remove [the Olivers] to effectuate
a 'sale' of the [Property] based on [Plaintiffs'] claim of right
to foreclose by virtue of past default judgments made on the
[Olivers] for trespassing upon open probate estate lands the
Plaintiff[s] claim[] to have bought."
(b) "Although given notice and information that [the
Olivers] no longer owned the [Property], the [circuit] court
allowed [the Plaintiffs] to proceed without notice to the owner
Trusts, protected by Executive Order, Probate Law and Irrevocable
Trust status."
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve the
Olivers' points of error as follows:
On April 16, 2008, the circuit court entered a Final
Judgment as to Foreclosure, which the court certified pursuant to
HRCP Rule 54(b).  On August 21, 2008, the circuit court entered
an Amended Order Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for Confirmation of
Sale or, in the Alternative, to Reopen Bidding, which the court3certified pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b).  The Olivers did not
appeal from the Final Judgment or the Amended Order Granting
Plaintiffs' Motion for Confirmation of Sale or, in the
Alternative, to Reopen Bidding.  Therefore, any challenge to
title and confirmation of the sale of the Property is precluded
in this appeal.  Budget Rent-A-Car Sys., Inc. v. Salazar, 9 Haw.
App. 469, 472, 846 P.2d 901, 903 (1993).  Title to the Property
and confirmation of the sale may not be collaterally attacked by
challenging the Judgment for Possession and Writ of Possession on
the ground that the judgment and writ were to "effectuate a sale"
of the Property.
The Olivers' remaining ground to challenge the Judgment
for Possession and Writ of Possession is that the Trustees of the
Oliver Revocable Trust were not provided notice of the action. 
The filed returns of service indicate that John and Mahealani, as
Trustees Under the Oliver Revocable Trust, were each served with
a copy of the complaint and summons.  On April 13, 2005, John and
Mahealani, Individually and as Trustees Under the Oliver
Revocable Trust, filed an answer to the complaint.  Notice was
given to John and Mahealani, as Trustees Under the Oliver
Revocable Trust. 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment for Possession
and Writ of Possession, each filed on February 12, 2009 in the
Circuit Court of the Second Circuit, are affirmed.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, March 19, 2010.
