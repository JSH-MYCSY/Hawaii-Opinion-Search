GRACIE DEWILDE and LILY DEWILDE, Petitioners-Appellees, v.
ERIC L. DAVIES and MIRELLA M. DAVIES, Respondents-Appellants
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
WAIALUA DIVISION
(Civ. No. 1SS07-1-755)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Nakamura, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
Respondents-Appellants Eric L. Davies and Mirella M.
Davies (collectively the "Davies") appeal, pro se, from the
summary denial of their "Motion for Relief from Order for
Injunction and Relief from Order Granting Attorneys Fees" (Motion
for Relief) entered on January 22, 2009 by the District Court of
the First Circuit, Waialua Division (district court).1  On
appeal, the Davies assert that the district court abused its
discretion when it denied the Motion for Relief without a
hearing.  The Davies argue that they were entitled to relief
under Hawai #i District Court Rules of Civil Procedure (DCRCP)
Rule 60(b)(6).  We disagree.
This appeal arises out of a "Petition for Ex Parte
Temporary Restraining Order and for Injunction Against
Harassment" pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 604-10.5
filed by Petitioners-Appellees Ashlen Aquila and Ivy Aquila
(Aquilas) on June 13, 2007 seeking an order enjoining the Davies
from certain acts towards the Aquilas.  An "Order GrantingNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2Petition for Injunction Against Harassment" was entered on
September 24, 2007 by the district court.
On November 6, 2007, the Aquilas filed a motion for
attorneys' fees and costs based in part on HRS ยง 604-10.5(g).  
The district court entered an award for fees and costs on
November 20, 2007.
The Davies filed a notice of appeal from the award of
attorneys' fees and costs on December 18, 2007.  In a summary
disposition order filed on January 20, 2009, this court affirmed
the order of the district court.  Acquila v. Davies, No. 28914,
2009 WL 132045 at *2 (App. January 20, 2009).
On January 20, 2009, the Davies submitted the Motion
for Relief.  The Motion for Relief was "brought pursuant to Rules
7 and 60(b) of the District Court Rules of Civil Procedure
. . . ."  In denying the Motion for Relief, the district court
wrote:  "DCRCP does not apply to HRS ยง 604-10.5.  See DCRCP
Rule 81(a)(4)."  The denied Motion for Relief was filed on
January 22, 2009.
On January 30, 2009, the Davies submitted a "Motion to
Reconsider Order Denying Motion for Relief from Order for
Injunction and Relief from Order Granting Attorneys Fees" (Motion
to Reconsider).  The Motion to Reconsider was made pursuant to
DCRCP Rules 7 and 59.  In the Motion to Reconsider, the Davies
argued that they were entitled to relief under DCRCP Rule
60(b)(6).  The Motion to Reconsider was denied and filed on
February 10, 2009.
Based on a review of the record, we conclude that the
district court did not err in denying the Davies's Motion for
Relief.
Therefore,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the district court's denial
of the "Motion for Relief from Order for Injunction and ReliefNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
