FUJISE AND LEONARD, JJ, WITH NAKAMURA, C.J., DISSENTING.

OPINION OF THE COURT BY FUJISE, J.

Defendant-Appellant Samuel Walker also known as Samuel

Ahsan (Walker) appeals from the January 26, 2009 judgment of

conviction entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit1

(circuit court) for, in Count 1, Habitually Operating a Vehicle

HRS § 291E-61.5 states in relevant part as follows:

§291E-61.5 Habitually operating a vehicle under the
influence of an intoxicant.  (a) A person commits the
(continued...)

FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2(...continued)
offense of habitually operating a vehicle under the
influence of an intoxicant if:

(1)		The person is a habitual operator of a vehicle while
under the influence of an intoxicant; and

(2)		The person operates or assumes actual physical control
of a vehicle:

(A)		While under the influence of alcohol in an

amount sufficient to impair the person's normal
mental faculties or ability to care for the
person and guard against casualty; 
 
(B)		While under the influence of any drug that
impairs the person's ability to operate the
vehicle in a careful and prudent manner;

(C)		With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two
hundred ten liters of breath; or

(D)		With .08 or more grams of alcohol per one
hundred milliliters or cubic centimeters of

blood.

b) 
For the purposes of this section:

"Convicted three or more times for offenses of

operating a vehicle under the influence" means that, at the
time of the behavior for which the person is charged under
this section, the person had three or more times within ten
years of the instant offense:

(1)		A judgment on a verdict or a finding of guilty,
or a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, for a
violation of this section or section 291-4,
291-4.4, or 291-7 as those sections were in
effect on December 31, 2001, or section 291E-61
or 707-702.5;

(2)		A judgment on a verdict or a finding of guilty,
or a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, for an
offense that is comparable to this section or
section 291-4, 291-4.4, or 291-7 as those
sections were in effect on December 31, 2001, or
section 291E-61 or 707-702.5; or

(3)		An adjudication of a minor for a law or
probation violation that, if committed by an
adult, would constitute a violation of this
section or section 291-4, 291-4.4, or 291-7 as
those sections were in effect on December 31,
2001, or section 291E-61 or 707-702.5;

that, at the time of the instant offense, had not been
expunged by pardon, reversed, or set aside. All convictions

that have been expunged by pardon, reversed, or set aside
prior to the instant offense shall not be deemed prior

in Count 2, Operating a Vehicle after License and Privilege have

been Suspended or Revoked for Operating a Vehicle Under the

Influence of an Intoxicant in violation of HRS § 291E-62(a)(2)

(2007); and in Count 3, Consuming or Possessing Intoxicating

Liquor While Operating a Motor Vehicle in violation of HRS § 291­
3.1 (2007).  On appeal, Walker challenges the judgment with

regard to Count 1 only.

The dispositive issue raised in this appeal is the

sufficiency of the HOVUII charge where it fails to include the

definition of a "habitual operator of a vehicle while under the

influence of an intoxicant" (habitual operator).

A circuit court's determination of whether or not a 
charge sufficiently alleges the elements of an offense is subject 
to de novo review on appeal. State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai' i 383, 
219 P.3d 1170 (2009). Walker first objected to the charge prior to the verdict and therefore the liberal construction rule does 
not apply. "Our adoption of this liberal construction standard 
is limited to construing indictments, when the issue is only 
raised after trial." State v. Motta, 66 Haw. 89, 94, 657 P.2d 
1019, 1022 (1983) (footnote omitted). 
In Count 1, Walker was charged as follows:

On or about the 17th day of April, 2008, in the City and
County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, SAMUEL WALKER, also
known as SAMUEL AHSAN, a habitual operator of a vehicle
while under the influence of an intoxicant, did operate or
assume actual physical control of a vehicle while under the
influence of alcohol in an amount sufficient to impair his
normal mental faculties or ability to care for himself and
guard against casualty, thereby committing the offense of
Habitually Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an
Intoxicant, in violation of Sections 291E-61.5(a)(1) and
291E-61.5(a)(2)(A) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.

2(...continued)
convictions for the purposes of proving the person's status
as a habitual operator of a vehicle while under the
influence of an intoxicant.

A person has the status of a "habitual operator of a
vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant" if the

person has been convicted three or more times within ten
years of the instant offense, for offenses of operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant.

FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The minimum requirements for a criminal charge are set

by statute.

Sufficiency of averments as to offense and transaction.  In

an indictment the offense may be charged either by name or
by reference to the statute defining or making it
punishable; and the transaction may be stated with so much
detail of time, place, and circumstances and such
particulars as to the person (if any) against whom, and the
thing (if any) in respect to which the offense was
committed, as are necessary to identify the transaction, to
bring it within the statutory definition of the offense
charged, to show that the court has jurisdiction, and to
give the accused reasonable notice of the facts.

Averments which so charge the offense and the
transaction shall be held to be sufficient. 
 
HRS § 806-34 (1993). Although the statute was written using the
 
permissive "may," the Hawai' i Supreme Court has construed HRS 
§ 806-34 to set forth mandatory requirements for a charge. State

v. Stan's Contracting, Inc., 111 Hawai' i 17, 31, 137 P.3d 331, 
345 (2006) (HRS § 806-34 . . . , states that an indictment must set forth the details of the transaction involving the defendant) 
(emphasis added). The court tied the requirements of the 
"details of the transaction" of HRS § 806-34 to article I, 
section 14 of the Hawai' i Constitution, protecting the accused's 
right "to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation." Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). The Hawai' i Supreme 
Court also construed as mandatory, the allegation of facts establishing jurisdiction. Stan's Contracting, 111 Hawai' i at 
32, 137 P.3d at 346 ("jurisdiction of the offense charged and of the person of the accused is a fundamental and indispensable 
prerequisite to a valid prosecution") (internal quotation marks 
omitted) quoting Adams v. State, 103 Hawai' i 214, 221, 81 P.3d 
394, 401 (2003). 
HRS § 806-34 treats the requirements for identification

of the offense separately from requirements for the description

of the transaction. The identification of the offense under HRS

§ 806-34 is satisfied by reference to the statute defining the

offense. ("In an indictment the offense may be charged either by

name or by reference to the statute defining or making it

4

FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
punishable.") HRS § 806-34 requires that the description of the
 
transaction (1) identifies the transaction; (2) brings the

transaction within the definition of the offense; (3) shows that

the court has jurisdiction; and (4) gives notice of the facts to

the accused. The statute's reference to the definition of the

offense appears to be a requirement alleging the elements of an

offense. Since the allegation of a criminal offense cognizable

under the laws of the State is a jurisdictional requirement (see

3	 HRS § 603-21.5(1) (Supp. 2010) and HRS § 604-8 (Supp. 2010) 4
)
 
3		HRS § 603-21.5 provides,

General.  (a) The several circuit courts shall have

jurisdiction, except as otherwise expressly provided by
statute, of:

(1)		Criminal offenses cognizable under the laws of
the State, committed within their respective
circuits or transferred to them for trial by
change of venue from some other circuit court;

. . . .

(b) The several circuit courts shall have concurrent

jurisdiction with the family court over:

(1)		Any felony under section 571-14, violation of an
order issued pursuant to chapter 586, or a
violation of section 709-906 when multiple
offenses are charged through complaint or
indictment and at least one other offense is a

criminal offense under subsection (a)(1);

(2)		Any felony under section 571-14 when multiple
offenses are charged through complaint or
indictment and at least one other offense is a

violation of an order issued pursuant to chapter
586, a violation of section 709-906, or a
misdemeanor under the jurisdiction of section
604-8; [and]

(3)		Any violation of section 711-1106.4[.] 
 
4

HRS § 604-8 provides:

Criminal, misdemeanors, generally.  (a) District courts
shall have jurisdiction of, and their criminal jurisdiction
is limited to, criminal offenses punishable by fine, or by
imprisonment not exceeding one year whether with or without
fine. They shall not have jurisdiction over any offense for
which the accused cannot be held to answer unless on a

presentment or indictment of a grand jury.

(continued...)

5

FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
items 2 and 3 appear to be requirements of jurisdiction. See 
also State v. Kekuewa, 114 Hawai' i 411, 424, 163 P.3d 1148, 1161 
(2007), abrogated on other grounds as recognized by Loher v. 
State, 118 Hawai' i 522, 193 P.3d 438 (App. 2008). ("In other 
words, an oral charge, complaint, or indictment that does not state an offense contains within it a substantive jurisdictional 
defect[.]"). Therefore, the factual description of the 
transaction has a jurisdictional component and is in addition to 
the requirement of giving the defendant "reasonable notice of the 
facts." HRS § 806-34. 
Hawai'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 7(d) 
reflects a similar distinction between the requirements for the 
description of the offense charged and the facts giving rise to 
the charge. With respect to the identification of the charge, 
HRPP Rule 7(d) requires that "[t]he charge shall state for each 
count the official or customary citation of the statute, rule, 
regulation or other provision of law[.]" With respect to the 
description of the transaction, HRPP Rule 7(d) requires that 
"[t]he charge shall be a plain, concise and definite statement of 
the essential facts constituting the offense charged." The 
general rule is codified in HRS § 806-26 (1993), which provides 
that the use of a statutorily defined term is sufficient to 
convey its statutorily defined meaning: 
The words and phrases used in an indictment shall be
construed according to their usual acceptation, except words
and phrases which have been defined by law or which have
acquired a legal signification, which words and phrases
shall be construed according to their legal signification
and shall be sufficient to convey that meaning.

4(...continued)

. . . .

(b) The district court shall have concurrent

jurisdiction with the family court of any violation of an
order issued pursuant to chapter 586 or any violation of
section 709-906 when multiple offenses are charged and at
least one other offense is a criminal offense within the

jurisdiction of the district courts. 
 
6

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
However, compliance with the requirements for

identification of the charge under HRS § 806-34 and HRPP Rule

7(d) does not necessarily satisfy the requirements for the

allegation of the transaction, as citation to the statute would

not cure the failure to allege an element of an offense. State

v. Elliott, 77 Hawai' i 309, 312, 884 P.2d 372, 375 (1994). Where 
the statute employs generic terms that do not convey the 
specifics of what the prosecution must prove, a charge in the 
language of the statute may be insufficient. See e.g., State v. 
Cummings, 101 Hawai' i 139, 143, 63 P.3d 1109, 1113 (2003) (charge 
of Driving Under the Influence under HRS § 291-4(a)(1) (Supp. 
1998) that did not include defendant was under the influence "in 
an amount sufficient to impair the person's normal mental 
faculties or ability to care for oneself and guard against 
casualty" was fatally deficient). 
In Wheeler, 121 Hawai' i at 395, 219 P.3d at 1182, the 
court relied in part on HRS § 806-31 which requires that the 
accusation be comprehensible to a person of "common 
understanding." 
Indirect allegations.  No indictment or bill of particulars
is invalid or insufficient for the reason merely that it
alleges indirectly and by inference instead of directly any
matters, facts, or circumstances connected with or
constituting the offense, provided that the nature and cause
of the accusation can be understood by a person of common
understanding.

HRS § 806-31 (1993).5 In Wheeler, the Hawai' i Supreme Court held 
that "[t]he use of the phrase 'operate' did not provide adequate 
notice to Wheeler that the State was required to prove that his 
operation of the vehicle occurred on a public way, street, road, 
or highway." Wheeler, 121 Hawai' i at 395, 219 P.3d at 1182. 
5

HRS § 806-31 is consistent with the general rule that words of a
statute are to have their commonly understood meaning. HRS § 1-14 (2009):

Words have usual meaning.  The words of a law are generally
to be understood in their most known and usual

signification, without attending so much to the literal and
strictly grammatical construction of the words as to their
general or popular use or meaning.

7

FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Just as the word "operate" does not suggest operation

on a public road, "habitual operator" does not convey the narrow

definition that the person charged had three prior convictions

within the previous ten years. See HRS § 291E-61.5(b). The word

"habitual" is defined as "of the nature of a habit; fixed by or

resulting from habit . . . ." Random House Webster's Unabridged

Dictionary 856 (2d ed. 2001). The word "habit" is defined as "an

acquired behavior pattern regularly followed until it has become

almost involuntary[.]" Id. Black's Law Dictionary defines

"habitual" as "[c]ustomary; usual" as the primary definition and

"[r]ecidivist" as a secondary definition. Black's Law Dictionary

779 (9th ed. 2009).

State v. Mita, 124 Hawai' i 385, 245 P.3d 458 (2010), is 
not to the contrary. In Mita, the offense in question was "Animal Nuisance" as defined by the Revised Ordinances of 
6	
and 7-2.3 Honolulu (ROH) § 7-2.2   7
. Mita was issued a citation

6		ROH § 7-2.2 provides, in pertinent part, 
 
"Animal nuisance," for the purposes of this section,
shall include but not be limited to any animal, farm animal
or poultry which:

(a)		Makes noise continuously and/or incessantly for a
period of 10 minutes or intermittently for one-half
hour or more to the disturbance of any person at any
time of day or night and regardless of whether the
animal, farm animal or poultry is physically situated
in or upon private property;

(b)		Barks, whines, howls, crows, cries or makes any other
unreasonable noise as described in Section 7-2.4(c) of
this article; or

(c)		Notwithstanding the provisions of HRS Section 142-75
or any other applicable law, bites or stings a person.

"Animals," unless provided otherwise, include but are
not limited to those animals that are customary and usual
pets such as dogs, cats, rabbits, birds, honeybees and other
beasts which are maintained on the premises of a dwelling
unit and kept by the resident of the dwelling unit solely
for personal enjoyment and companionship, such as, without

which was described as follows:

The citation, signed "Wanda Mita[,]" stated that Mita "[d]id
on/or about this 3 day of June Yr 08 at about 1940-2050 did
own, harbour or keep (animal description): Boxers Name

Roxy/Obie Color Brown . . . at (location): [ Mita's
residence address] and did commit the offense of: . . .
animal nuisance-Sec.: 7-2.3 Barking Dog[.]" Additionally,
the citation had a section entitled "Officer's Report" which
stated that "Mita was issued a Barking 3rd citation. She

was already issued a previous Barking 2 warning citation."

Id., 124 Hawai' i at 386, 245 P.3d at 459. At trial, the 
prosecution presented the following oral charge:

On or about June 3rd, 2008, in the city and county of
Honolulu, state of Hawaii, you as the owner of an animal,
farm animal, or poultry engaged in animal nuisance as
defined in section 7-2.2, thereby violating section 7-2.3 of
the Revised Ordinances of Honolulu.

Id. Mita challenged the charge at trial, arguing that under

State v. Jendrusch, 58 Haw. 279, 567 P.2d 1242 (1977), she was

entitled to know what conduct, prescribed in ROH § 7-2.2, she was

accused of violating. Mita, 124 Hawai' i at 387, 245 P.3d at 460. 
The Hawai' i Supreme Court distinguished Wheeler as follows: 
In Wheeler, the defendant was orally charged with operating
a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant (OVUII). 121Hawai'i at 386-87, 219 P.3d at 1173-74. The charge tracked
the language of the relevant statute, HRS § 291E-61, andalleged that the defendant "did operate or assume actualphysical control of a motor vehicle while under theinfluence of alcohol . . . ." Id. However, the charge did
not further include the definition of the term "operate,"which was defined in HRS § 291E-1 as "to drive or assumeactual physical control of a vehicle upon a public way,street, road, or highway . . . ." Id. at 391, 219 P.3d at 
6(...continued)
limitation, for a hobby, for legal sporting activities and
for guarding of property; excluding aviary game birds and
fish as defined in the Hawaii Revised Statutes.

7 ROH § 7-2.3 provides, in pertinent part, 
 
Animal nuisance--Prohibited.

It is unlawful to be the owner of an animal, farm
animal or poultry engaged in animal nuisance as defined in
Section 7-2.2; provided, however, that it shall not be
deemed to be animal nuisance for purposes of this article
if, at the time the animal, farm animal or poultry is making
any noise, biting or stinging, a person is trespassing or
threatening trespass upon private property in or upon which
the animal, farm animal or poultry is situated, or for any
other legitimate cause which teased or provoked said animal,
farm animal or poultry.

_____________________ 
7   HRS § 702-205 provides: "The elements of an offense are such

(1) conduct, (2) attendant circumstances, and (3) results of
conduct, as: (a) Are specified by the definition of the offense,
and (b) Negative a defense (other than a defense based on the
statute of limitations, lack of venue, or lack of jurisdiction)."

FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
1178 (emphasis in original). This court held that HRS

§ 291E-1 establishes an attendant circumstance of the
proscribed conduct, i.e., that the offense of OVUII occur on
a public way, street, road, or highway. Id. at 392-93, 219
P.3d at 1179-80. Therefore, since the location of the
proscribed conduct established by HRS § 291E-1 was an
attendant circumstance, this court held that it was an
essential element of the offense of OVUII that should have

been included within the charge against the defendant. Id.

(citing HRS § 702-205 (1993)).
7

This court emphasized that although the charge tracked
the language of the statute, the term "operate" as used in
HRS § 291E-61 "is neither 'unmistakable' nor 'readily
comprehensible to persons of common understanding'" and
therefore did not provide the defendant with fair notice of
that aspect of the charge. Id. at 394-95, 219 P.3d at 1181­
82 (citation omitted). 
Specifically, this court concluded
that the common understanding of the term "operate" "does
not geographically limit where the conduct must take place."
Id. at 394, 219 P.3d at 1181. Therefore, merely including
the term "operate" in the charge, without providing the
defendant with notice that his conduct must have occurred

"upon a public way, street, road, or highway," was
insufficient. Id. Additionally, this court recognized that
"none of the other information in the charge provided [the
defendant] with fair notice of that element" where, for
example, the charge "did not contain any specification of
where the alleged offense occurred, other than it took place
in the City and County of Honolulu." Id. at 395, 219 P.3d at
1182.

There are two significant factors present in the
instant case that were not present in Wheeler, thus making
it readily distinguishable: 
(1) the definition of "animal
nuisance" in ROH § 7-2.2 does not create an additional
essential element of the offense; and (2) in any event, the
definition of "animal nuisance" is consistent with its

commonly understood meaning and therefore Mita had fair
notice of the offense charged. Thus, the oral charge
against Mita, which tracked the language of ROH § 7-2.3,
sufficiently alleged all of the essential elements of the
offense of animal nuisance.

Mita, 124 Hawai' i at 390-91, 245 P.3d at 463-64. 
On the other hand, the charge of HOVUII is essentially

a recidivist offense and virtually the only difference between it

and the offense of Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an

Intoxicant (OUVII) under HRS § 291E-61 is the number of previous

convictions required for an HOVUII conviction. The term

"habitual," or even "habitual operator," does not convey the

10

FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
specificity of the term for HOVUII purposes. Thus, it does not
 
qualify as a term used as commonly understood. HRS § 806-31.
 
Moreover, although discussed in different contexts, the

Hawai'i Supreme Court has determined on a number of occasions 
that the prior convictions for OVUII is an attendant

circumstance, and thus is an additional element of the offense.

Thus, in State v. Ruggiero, 114 Hawai' i 227, 239, 160 
P.3d 703, 715 (2007), the Hawaii Supreme Court held that:

Inasmuch as we conclude, supra, that a prior conviction, as
described in HRS § 291E-61(b)(2) (Supp. 2003), is an
elemental attendant circumstance, intrinsic to the offense
of operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant,
it was necessary that Ruggiero's prior conviction be alleged
in the charging instrument and proven at trial as
preconditions to his present conviction of operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant for the second

time within five years, in violation of HRS § 291E-61(a) and
(b)(2).

Similarly, in State v. Domingues, when determining

whether the present HOUVII statute was a re-enactment of the

predecessor statute, HRS § 291-4.4(a), the court held that the

language "during a ten-year period the person has been convicted

three or more times for a driving under the influence offense[,]"

included as an element of the offense in HRS § 291-4.4(a) but

removed from the provision defining the offense and placed into

the sentencing provisions of HRS §291E-61, retained its character

as an attendant circumstance. 106 Hawai' i 480, 487, 107 P.3d 
409, 416 (2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). The court

went on to note, 
 
Indeed, "[a]n offense under [HRS § 291E-61(b)(4)] is a
class C felony," . . . entitling a defendant to a jury
trial, whereas the offenses described in HRS §§ 291E­
61(b)(1) through 291E-61(b)(3) would appear to be petty
misdemeanors, as to which no right to a jury trial would
attach. 
See id. If the prefatory language of HRS §§ 291E­
61(b)(1) through 291E-61(b)(4) were mere "sentencing
factors" that the prosecution was not obliged to allege and
prove to the trier of fact, as Domingues suggests, then
defendants charged with HRS § 291E-61 offenses would have no
idea what the particular offense was that they were charged
with committing or whether they were entitled to a jury
trial.

Id. at 487 n.8, 107 P.3d at 416 n.8.

11

FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
A charge must state all the essential elements of an 
offense. Wheeler, 121 Hawai' i at 391, 219 P.3d at 1178; Elliott, 
77 Hawai' i at 311, 884 P.2d at 374 citing State v. Jendrusch, 58 
Haw. 279, 567 P.2d 1242 (1977) ("In Jendrusch, we held that the 
failure to allege an essential element of an offense made a 
charge 'fatally defective.'"). This requirement is not 
necessarily satisfied by a reference to or recitation of the 
statute. See State v. Israel, 78 Hawai' i 66, 73-74, 890 P.2d 
303, 310-311 (1995). Proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Walker was a "habitual operator of a vehicle while under the influence 
of an intoxicant" as that phrase might be understood given the 
words usual meaning (see HRS § 1-14 (2009)), would not 
necessarily result in a conviction. A conviction would only lie 
upon proof that Walker "has been convicted three or more times 
within ten years of the instant offense, for offenses of 
operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant" as 
prescribed in HRS § 291E-61.5(b). Thus, the three prior 
convictions are attendant circumstance elements of the offense. 
See Ruggiero, 114 Hawai' i at 239, 160 P.3d at 715. 
Since proof of each element of the offense is required

for a conviction (HRS § 701-114(1)(a)), the proof of three or

more convictions within the previous ten years is an element of

the offense and therefore should have been included in the

charge.

Therefore, we vacate the January 26, 2009 judgment of

the Circuit Court of the First Circuit in Count 1 and remand the

case with instructions to the circuit court to dismiss Count 1

without prejudice.
