WAYNE MORI CROWELL, Petitioner-Appellant,
v. 
STATE OF HAWAI» I, Respondent-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P. NO. 08-1-0008, CR NO. 57156)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley, and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Wayne Mori Crowell (Crowell)
 
appeals from the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order
 
Denying Petition for Post-Conviction Relief Without a Hearing"
 (Order Denying Petition), which was filed on January 27, 2009, in
 the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court).
1 We
 
affirm.
 
I.
 
In Crowell's underlying criminal case, Crowell was
 
charged by indictment in 1982 with three counts of first degree
 robbery (Counts I, III, and IV) and one count of second degree
 robbery (Count II). On November 18, 1983, a jury found Crowell
 guilty as charged on all counts. Crowell was sentenced to
 
extended terms of life imprisonment, with the possibility of
 parole, for the three first degree robbery convictions and a non-
extended term of ten years of imprisonment for the second degree
 robbery conviction, all terms to run concurrently. 
Crowell filed a direct appeal from the judgment on
 
these convictions and sentences in Appeal No. 9733. On August
 21, 1985, this court issued an opinion which vacated Crowell's

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
conviction and sentence for the first degree robbery charged in
 
Count IV and affirmed his convictions and sentences with respect
 to Counts I, II, and III. State v. Crowell , 5 Haw. App. 674, 706
 
P.2d 453 (1985). Crowell did not seek review of this court's
 opinion, and his convictions and sentences on Counts I, II, and
 III, including the extended terms of life imprisonment on Counts
 I and III, became final in 1985.
 
On February 12, 2008, Crowell filed a "Petition to
 
Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner
 from Custody" (Petition), pursuant to Hawaii Rules of Penal
 Procedure Rule 40 (2006). The circuit court denied the Petition
 and issued its Order Denying Petition on January 27, 2009. This
 appeal followed.
 
II.
 
Crowell argues on appeal, as he did in his Petition, 
that based on State v. Maugaotega , 115 Hawai» i 432, 168 P.3d 562 
(2007) (Maugaotega II ), the version of the extended term statute 
under which he as sentenced, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 706­
662 (1976 & Supp. 1984), was void ab initio, and thus his extended term sentences must be vacated and ordinary term sentences imposed. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, we hold as follows: 
Maugaotega II  does not apply retroactively to Crowell's 
collateral attack on his extended term sentences on Counts I and III which became final in 1985. See State v. Gomes, 107 Hawai» i 
308, 312-14, 113 P.3d 184, 188-90 (2005); Loher v. State , 118 
Hawai» i 522, 534-38, 193 P.3d 438, 450-54 (App. 2008); United 
States v. Cruz, 423 F.3d 1119, 1120-21 (9th Cir. 2005). 
The version of HRS ÿÿ 706-662 under which Crowell was 
sentenced was not void ab initio. See State v. Jess, 117 Hawai» i 
381, 388-89, 406-15, 184 P.3d 133, 140-41, 158-67 (2008); State v. Cutsinger, 118 Hawai» i 68, 79-82, 185 P.3d 816, 827-830 (App. 
2008), overruled in part on other grounds by Jess, 117 Hawai» i at

398 n.17, 184 P.3d at 150 n.17; Loher , 118 Hawai» i at 534-38, 193 
P.3d at 450-54. Crowell's extended term sentences became final 
long before the United States Supreme Court announced its new constitutional rule of criminal procedure in Apprendi v. New 
Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), and thus Crowell's extended term 
sentences were constitutional and legal when imposed. See Gomes, 
107 Hawai» i at 314, 113 P.3d at 190. In Jess , the Hawai» i Supreme 
Court held that the trial court had the authority to resentence 
Jess to extended terms of imprisonment pursuant to the former version of the extended term sentencing statute, HRS ÿÿ 706-662 (Supp. 1996), which was in effect in 2000 when Jess committed the charged offenses, by invoking its inherent judicial power to empanel a jury to make the "necessity" finding. Jess , 117 
Hawai» i at 388-89, 410-13, 184 P.3d at 140-41, 162-65; see also, 
State v. Mark, No. 26784, 2010 WL 1888944, at *45-47 (Hawai» i May 
12, 2010). The supreme court could not have reached this 
conclusion in Jess if the former versions of HRS ÿÿ 706-662 were void ab initio. 
Accordingly, Crowell is not entitled to have his
 
extended term sentences vacated or set aside.

Petition is affirmed.
