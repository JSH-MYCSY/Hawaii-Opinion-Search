STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
BRENDON LEE PACHECO, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
HONOLULU DIVISION
(HPD TRAFFIC NO. 1DTA-08-08576)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Brendon Lee Pacheco ( Pacheco)
appeals from the Judgment entered on February 23, 2009, in the
District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (District
Court).1  Pacheco was convicted of Operating a Vehicle Under the
Influence of an Intoxicant, in violation of Hawaii Revised
Statutes (HRS) ยง 291E-61(a) and (b) (Supp. 2009) ( OVUII).
On appeal, Pacheco contends the District Court erred by
denying his motion to dismiss the charge on the ground that the
written complaint and oral charge failed to state an essential
element of the offense, i.e., that Pacheco operated or assumed
actual physical control of a vehicle upon a public way, street,
road, or highway.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Pacheco's point of error as follows:
 "[T]he operation of a vehicle on a public way, street,
road, or highway is an attendant circumstance of the offense of
OVUII, and is therefore an element of the offense."  State v.
Wheeler, 121 Hawai# i 383, 393, 219 P.3d 1170, 1180 (2009).  TheNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2failure to allege that Pacheco was driving a vehicle upon a
public way, street, road, or highway at the time of the offense
rendered the charge deficient.  Id.
Therefore, the District Court's February 23, 2009
Judgment is vacated and this case is remanded to the District
Court for dismissal of the OVUII charge without prejudice.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, February 18, 2010.
