SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley, and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Anthony Felix Torres (Torres)
 
appeals from the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order
 
Denying Hearing on and Dismissing Petition to Vacate, Set Aside,
 or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner from Custody, Filed
 December 27, 2007" (Order Dismissing Petition), which was filed
 on February 13, 2009, in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit
 (circuit court).
1 We affirm.
 
I.
 
In Torres's underlying criminal case, a jury found 
Torres guilty of the included offense of manslaughter on October 30, 1996. Torres was sentenced on December 20, 1996, to an extended term of imprisonment of twenty years. Torres filed a direct appeal from his judgment of conviction and sentence in Appeal No. 20403. On February 5, 1998, the Hawai» i Supreme Court 
issued a summary disposition order affirming Torres's conviction and the judgment from which Torres appealed. Torres's conviction and sentence became final in 1998 after the supreme court filed its Judgment on Appeal. 
On December 27, 2007, Torres filed a "Petition to
 
Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner
 from Custody" (Petition), pursuant to Hawaii Rules of Penal
 Procedure Rule 40 (2006). Torres asserted three grounds for
 relief in the Petition: (1) his extended term sentence was

unconstitutional and violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury 
trial and Fourteenth Amendment right to due process; (2) he was 
subjected to multiple sentences in violation of Article I, 
section 10 of the Hawai» i Constitution and the Fifth Amendment of 
the United States Constitution; and (3) the prosecutor had engaged in vindictive misconduct. Torres filed a memorandum of law and other pleadings in support of his Petition. The circuit court concluded that Torres's claims did not entitle him to any relief and issued its Order Dismissing Petition on February 13, 2009. 
II.
 
Torres argues on appeal, as he did in support of his 
Petition, that based on State v. Maugaotega , 115 Hawai» i 432, 168 
P.3d 562 (2007) (Maugaotega II ), the version of the extended term 
statute under which he as sentenced, Hawaii Revised Statutes 
(HRS) § 706-662 (Supp. 1990), was void ab initio, and thus his extended term sentence must be vacated and an ordinary term sentence imposed. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, we hold as follows: 
Maugaotega II does not apply retroactively to Torres's 
collateral attack on his extended term sentence which became final in 1998. See State v. Gomes, 107 Hawai» i 308, 312-14, 113 
P.3d 184, 188-90 (2005); Loher v. State, 118 Hawai» i 522, 534-38, 
193 P.3d 438, 450-54 (App. 2008); United States v. Cruz, 423 F.3d 1119, 1120-21 (9th Cir. 2005). 
The version of HRS ÿÿ 706-662 under which Torres was 
sentenced was not void ab initio. See State v. Jess, 117 Hawai» i 
381, 388-89, 406-15, 184 P.3d 133, 140-41, 158-67 (2008); State 
v. Cutsinger, 118 Hawai» i 68, 79-82, 185 P.3d 816, 827-830 (App. 
2008), overruled in part on other grounds by Jess, 117 Hawai» i at 
398 n.17, 184 P.3d at 150 n.17; Loher , 118 Hawai» i at 534-38, 193 
P.3d at 450-54. Torres's extended term sentence became final 
before the United States Supreme Court announced its new 
constitutional rule of criminal procedure in Apprendi v. New 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
3Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), and thus Torres's extended term
sentence was constitutional and legal when imposed.  See Gomes,
107 Hawai #i at 314, 113 P.3d at 190.  In Jess, the Hawai# i Supreme
Court held that the trial court had the authority to resentence
Jess to extended terms of imprisonment pursuant to the former
version of the extended term sentencing statute, HRS § 706-662
(Supp. 1996), which was in effect in 2000 when Jess committed the
charged offenses, by invoking its inherent judicial power to
empanel a jury to make the "necessity" finding.  Jess, 117
Hawai#i at 388-89, 410-13, 184 P.3d at 140-41, 162-65; see also,
State v. Mark, No. 26784, 2010 WL 1888944, at *45-47 (Hawai #i May
12, 2010).  The supreme court could not have reached this
conclusion in Jess if the former versions of HRS § 706-662 were
void ab initio .  
Torres's reliance upon Riley v. Kennedy, 553 U.S. 406,
128 S. Ct. 1970 (2008), is misplaced.  The context in which the
Court in Riley determined that an Alabama election law was
properly regarded as void ab initio  was far different from
Torres's situation.  Riley is inapposite and does not support
Torres's arguments. 
Accordingly, Torres is not entitled to have his
extended term sentence vacated or set aside. 
III.
The circuit court's February 13, 2009, Order Dismissing
Petition is affirmed.
