IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
MARK OYAMA, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. 5DTA-08-00218)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Fujise and Leonard, JJ., with
Nakamura, C.J., concurring separately)
Defendant-Appellant Mark Oyama (Oyama) appeals from the
February 3, 2009 judgment of conviction for Operating a Vehicle
Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII) in violation of
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 291E-61(a)(1) and/or (3) (Supp.
2008) and sentenced pursuant to HRS ยง 291E-61(b)(2) (Supp. 2008)
as a highly intoxicated driver entered by the District Court of
the Fifth Circuit (district court).1
After a careful review of the issue raised, arguments
advanced, applicable law, and the record in the instant case, in
light of the Hawai# i Supreme Court's opinion in State v. Wheeler,
121 Hawai #i 383, 219 P.3d 1170 (2009), which held that the
failure of the charge to allege that the offense took place on a
public way, street, road, or highway rendered the charge fatally
defective, the complaint in this case, which also lacked this
allegation, was deficient.  Wheeler, 121 Hawai# i at 393, 219 P.3d
at 1180.
A charge that is fatally defective is a nullity and
deprives the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction over the
prosecution.  State v. Cummings, 101 Hawai# i 139, 145, 63 P.3d
1109, 1115 (2003).  Although the issue of jurisdiction has not
been raised by the parties, the court will nevertheless addressNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2the issue "for unless jurisdiction of the court over the subject
matter exists, any judgment rendered is invalid."  Meyer v.
Territory, 36 Haw. 75, 78 (Haw. Terr. 1942), quoted with approval
in In re Application of Rice, 68 Haw. 334, 335, 713 P.2d 426, 427
(1986); see also Tamashiro v. Dep't of Human Servs., State of
Hawai#i, 112 Hawai# i 388, 398, 146 P.3d 103, 113 (2006).
We do not reach the issue raised by Oyama on appeal. 
The disposition of this appeal on the issue of jurisdiction of
the district court limits our consideration of the appeal to the
correction of the jurisdiction issue.  In re Application of Rice,
68 Haw. at 335, 713 P.3d at 427 ("[T]hough a [district] court is
found to have lacked jurisdiction, we have jurisdiction here on
appeal, not of the merits, but for the purpose of correcting an
error in jurisdiction.") (internal quotation marks and citation
omitted).
Accordingly, we vacate the February 3, 2009 judgment of
conviction of the District Court of the Fifth Circuit and remand
for dismissal of the OVUII charge without prejudice.
