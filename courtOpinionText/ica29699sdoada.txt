NO. 29699
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
OLGA MARY LANSING, Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/
Appellant, v. NANCEE JENKO-CRISPIN, Defendant/Counterclaim­
Plaintiff/Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 06-1-1891)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellant Olga M.
 
Lansing (Lansing) appeals pro se from the February 4, 2009
 
amended judgment entered by the Circuit Court of the First
 
Circuit (circuit court)1
 in favor of Defendant/Counterclaim­
Plaintiff/Appellee Nancee Jenko-Crispin (Jenko-Crispin).
 
Lansing filed this case seeking the return of a deposit
 
she made as the winning bidder at a October 13, 2004 foreclosure
 auction. 
Jenko-Crispin was the court-appointed commissioner
 
overseeing the auction. Arlette Harada (Harada) was Jenko­Crispin's attorney.
 
Lansing's Opening Brief fails to comply with Hawai' i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4) because it does 
not identify the alleged error committed by the court nor cite 
where in the record the alleged error occurred, where she 
objected to such error, or where it was brought to the attention 
of the court. HRAP Rule 28(b)(4)(i)-(iii). An appellant's

"failure to conform his [or her] brief to the requirements of 
HRAP Rule 28(b) burdens both the parties compelled to respond to 
the brief and the appellate court attempting to render an 
informed judgment" and would alone be grounds to dismiss an 
appeal. Hous. Fin. & Dev. Corp. v. Ferguson, 91 Hawai' i 81, 
85-86, 979 P.2d 1107, 1111-12 (1999). However, as the appellate courts have "consistently adhered to the policy of affording 
litigants the opportunity to have their cases heard on the 
merits, where possible," Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai' i 
225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 558 (1995) (citation and internal quotations omitted), we attempt to address Lansing's appeal. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Lansing's points of error as follows:
 
(1) Lansing alleges the circuit court erred in 
accepting orders prepared by Harada. Under Rule 23 of the Rules 
of the Circuit Court of the State of Hawai' i (RCCH), it is 
routine practice in Hawai' i circuit courts that the prevailing 
party, or his or her attorney, prepare proposed orders, which the 
circuit court may then approve. RCCH Rule 23 is a procedural 
provision intended to expedite the court's business. Rhoads v. 
Okamura, 98 Hawai' i 407, 410, 49 P.3d 373, 376 (2002), overruled 
on other grounds by Alford v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 109 
Hawai'i 14, 23, 122 P.3d 809, 818 (2005). The opposing side may 
object as to form prior to entry of the order. RCCH Rule 23(b). The circuit court cannot be said to have acted merely as a "stamp 
of approval" to the proposed orders prepared by Harada, given 
that it edited several of the orders before signing them and 
entering them. 
(2) Lansing alleges that the circuit court acted
 
"without her input" but fails to cite with any specificity where
 
such an alleged error occurred. It is unclear what specific
 
action of the circuit court Lansing claims as error here. Given
 
that "[t]he appellate courts are not obliged to search the record

to crystallize the parties' arguments," Laeroc Waikiki Parkside, 
LLC v. K.S.K. (Oahu) Ltd. P'ship, 115 Hawai' i 201, 218 n.19, 166 
P.3d 961, 978 n.19 (2007) (citing Lanai Co., Inc. v. Land Use Comm'n, 105 Hawai' i 296, 309 n.31, 97 P.3d 372, 385 n.31 (2004)), 
we decline to consider this argument. 
(3) & (4) Lastly, Lansing alleges that the circuit 
court failed to acknowledge Harada's fraud. Harada is not a party in this case. See Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 
18, 21. Therefore, the circuit court had no authority to act on Lansing's complaints against Harada. See Filipino Fed'n of Am., 
Inc. v. Cubico, 46 Haw. 353, 372, 380 P.2d 488, 498 (1963) ("In order for the decree of the lower court to be binding upon such 
persons, they must be made parties to the suit, either as 
plaintiffs or defendants."); Magoon v. Afong, 10 Haw. 340 (Haw. 
Rep. 1896). 
Appellants have "the burden of demonstrating that they 
are entitled to the relief sought before this court." Exotics 
Hawaii-Kona, Inc. v. E.I. Du Pont De Nemours & Co., 116 Hawai' i 
277, 309 n.21, 172 P.3d 1021, 1053 n.21 (2007) (citing 
Bettencourt, 80 Hawai' i at 230, 909 P.2d at 558). Lansing has 
not met that burden here. 
Therefore, the February 4, 2009 amended judgment of the
 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit against Lansing and in favor
 of Jenko-Crispin is affirmed.
