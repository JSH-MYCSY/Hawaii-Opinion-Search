STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
FRANK TORRES GIRON, JR., Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
HONOLULU DIVISION
(HPD TRAFFIC NO. 1DTC-08-045781)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Nakamura, Chief Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Frank Torres Giron, Jr. ( )
appeals the judgment entered on February 17, 2009 in the District
Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (District Court ).1 
Giron was convicted of Excessive Speeding, in violation of HRS ยง
291C-105(a)(1) (Supp. 2009). Giron
On appeal, Giron contends that the District Court erred
when it:  (1) denied his motion in limine because the State
failed to adduce the requisite foundation for admissibility of
the laser gun speed reading; and (2) denied his motion to compel
discovery.  Giron argues that "as there was insufficient
foundation laid for Officer Maeshiro's testimony as to Giron's
alleged speed, his conviction must be vacated and the case
remanded for an order striking all of Officer Maeshiro's
testimony as to the alleged speed of his vehicle and dismissing
this case with prejudice."
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Giron's points of error as follows:NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Giron objected to evidence of the laser gun reading.2
2The State failed to adduce evidence that the laser gun
was tested according to the manufacturer's recommended procedures
in order to establish sufficient foundation for the laser gun
reading.2  See State v. Assaye, 121 Hawai# i 204, 210-14, 216 P3d
1227, 1233-37 (2009).  Without the laser gun reading, there was
insufficient evidence to convict Giron of Excessive Speeding.  We
need not address Giron's other point of error.
For this reason, the District Court's February 17, 2009
judgment is reversed.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, February 18, 2010.
