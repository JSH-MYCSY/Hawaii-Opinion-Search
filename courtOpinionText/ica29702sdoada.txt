WAHI HO'OMALU LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, a Hawai' i 
limited partnership, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
HENRY MAIO, JR., Defendant-Appellant

HEIRS OR ASSIGNS OF KEKINO(w) ET AL., Defendants-Appellees
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 06-1-0140(3))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Henry Maio Jr. (Maio) appeals from
 
the February 9, 2009 Final Judgment and Decree (Judgment) entered
 
1
in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit  (circuit court)
pursuant to the November 5, 2008 Order Granting Plaintiff's 
Motion for Summary Judgment and the February 9, 2009 Findings of 
Facts and Conclusions of Law (FOFs/COLs). The Judgment, entered 
inter alia, gave fee simple title ownership to a parcel of land, 
described as Apana 1 of Royal Patent Number 3215, Land Commission 
Award (LCA) Number 2468 to Keau bearing Tax Map Key (TMK) 
designation (2) 3-3-02-01 to Plaintiff-Appellee Wahi Ho' omalu 
Limited Partnership (WHLP).

 The Honorable Joseph E. Cardoza presided. 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Maio argues the circuit court erred in granting WHLP's
 
motion for summary judgment because there are genuine issues of
 
material fact regarding the meaning of the language in the Mai
 
deed, whether Mai was the brother of Pala, whether Mai owned LCA
 
2468:1 at the time the 1892 Mai to J.W. Kalua deed was signed, in
 
whether the proper heirs were summoned, and with the maps
 
provided by WHLP.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Maio's
 
appeal is without merit.
 
[An appellate] court reviews a trial court's grant of
summary judgment de novo. O'ahu Transit Servs., Inc. v.
Northfield Ins. Co., 107 Hawai' i 231, 234, 112 P.3d 717, 720
(2005). The standard for granting a motion for summary
judgment is well settled: 
Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and
admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if
any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any
material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law. A fact is material if
 proof of that fact would have the effect of
establishing or refuting one of the essential elements
of a cause of action or defense asserted by the
parties. The evidence must be viewed in the light
most favorable to the non-moving party. In other
 words, [the appellate court] must view all of the
evidence and the inferences drawn therefrom in the
 light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.
 
Price v. AIG Hawai' i Ins. Co., 107 Hawai' i 106,
110, 111 P.3d 1, 5 (2005) (original brackets and
citation omitted). 
Kamaka v. Goodsill Anderson Quinn & Stifel
, 117 Hawai' i 92, 104, 
176 P.3d 91, 103 (2008). 
Maio must demonstrate that there were genuine issues of 
material fact. Omerod v. Heirs of Kaheananui, 116 Hawai' i 239, 
261, 172 P.3d 983, 1005 (2007). However, Maio does not do this. 
During the hearing on WHLP's motion for summary
 
judgment, Maio stated that he objected to the WHLP's contention
 
that he only had an interest in LCA 2468:1 TMK (2) 3-3-02-14. 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Maio stated that he had an undivided interest in the whole of LCA
 
2
2468:1  and questioned the validity of the survey maps submitted
by WHLP. Maio argued that the circuit court should not rely on
 
the TMK system because that system began in 1904 and because the
 
dimensions of LCA 2468:1 cannot change and be divided by TMKs as
 
"no surveyor or court has the authority to alter or modify a line
 
once it is created[,]" referring to the original boundary lines
 
determined when LCA 2468 was awarded.
 
WHLP argued that it satisfied its burden by showing
 
that WHLP had superior title to any other title for LCA 2468:1
 
TMK (2) 3-3-02-01 and that Maio only has title to LCA 2468:1 TMK
 
(2) 3-3-02-14 and no interest in LCA 2468:1 TMK (2) 3-3-02-01. 
WHLP argued the only experts involved in this case were WHLP's
 
experts. The defendants, including Maio, did not submit
 
testimony to the circuit court which countered WHLP's experts'
 
declarations which included metes and bounds, property
 
descriptions and maps, and WHLP's chain of title. WHLP argued it
 
proved a complete chain of title to LCA 2648:1 TMK (2) 3-3-02-01
 
and there was no factual dispute. WHLP argued that because Maio
 
specifically stated in his June 14, 2007 Opposition to Motion for
 
Summary Judgment that he had title in LCA 2468:1 TMK (2) 3-3-02­
14, which is a portion of land that WHLP is not claiming to own,
 
there was "no factual dispute" and "no genuine issue."
 
The court granted WHLP's motion for summary judgment as
 
to LCA 2468:1 TMK (2)3-3-02-01. In its February 9, 2009
 
FOFs/COLs, the circuit court found in relevant part the 
following:
 
FINDINGS OF FACT
 
. . . .
 
2
 At some point portions of LCA 2468:1 were assigned at least two
different TMKs, TMK (2) 3-3-02-1 and TMK (2) 3-3-02-14.
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
10. [Maio] . . . claim[s] to own the portion of LCA 2468:1
located in [TMK] (2)3-3-02-14, land not claimed by the
[WHLP] in this case[.]
 
. . . .
 13. [WHLP] has presented admissible evidence in the form
of certified documents, and has presented the Affidavit of
expert title abstractor and long searcher Collen Uahinui,
from Title Guaranty, who provided detailed information on
the chains of title of the eleven [LCAs] in this case, and
has presented survey descriptions and map from expert
surveyor Eduardo Valera. 
. . . .
 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
 
1. [Maio] has [not] set forth specific facts to [WHLP's]
Motion for Summary Judgment, showing that there is a genuine
issue for trial, so that [Maio] has [not] raised a genuine
issue as to any material fact, and based upon the evidence
presented, [WHLP] is entitled to a judgment as a matter of
law, all as required by HRCP Rule 56.
 
2. [WHLP] has proved that it has a good and complete
chain of title, by deed and inheritance, in fee simple
absolute, free and clear of all claims, lines, clouds and
encumbrances . . . to the following parcels of real
property:
 
. . . . 
B(a)	 All of that certain parcel of land (being a
portion of Apana 1 . . . [LCA] Number
2468 . . .) . . . bearing the [TMK] designation
(2) [3-3-02-01], containing an area of 0.433 acre and
0.886 acre[.]
 
B
(b) 	All of that certain parcel of land (being all of
Apana 2 . . . [LCA] Number 2468 . . .) . . .
bearing Tax Key designation (2)3-3-02-01,
containing an area of 0.465 acre, more or
less[.]
 
None of these FOFs/COLs are specifically challenged on 
appeal, as such, we accept these FOFs/COLs as binding in this 
appeal. Okada Trucking Co., Ltd. v. Bd. of Water Supply, 97 
Hawai'i 450, 458, 40 P.3d 73, 81 (2002); Alvarez Family Trust v. 
Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Kaanapali Alii, 121 Hawai' i 474, 
489, 221 P.3d 452, 467 (2009).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Maio argues there are genuine issues of fact regarding
 
the meaning of language in the Mai deed, whether Mai was the
 
brother of Pala, and whether Mai owned LCA 2468: Apana 1 at the
 
time the 1892 Mai to J.W. Kalua deed was signed. However, Maio
 
does not state where in the record there is any evidence offered
 
in opposition to WHLP's motion for summary judgment to create a
 
genuine issue of material fact, and we find none.
 
Maio also argues there is a "question on specific
 
parcel and if the proper heirs were summoned." The only part of
 
Maio's opening brief which arguably pertains to this argument is
 
the following sentence: "[WHLP] should not summon heirs to court
 
on parcels, LCA, RP, and then say they are not quieting the title
 
on a specific piece within the whole." Maio fails to give any
 
citations to authority to support his position, and we find none. 
Finally, Maio argues the circuit court erred in
 
granting WHLP's motion for summary judgment because there is a
 
genuine issue of material fact regarding the maps provided by
 
WHLP. Maio asserts that "each time map changes depending on the
 
discrepancy found within the placement of parcels on the map." 
Specifically, Maio argues that the survey of LCA 2468:1, provided
 
by WHLP, shows three separate parcels, but that WHLP does not
 
prove how there were three parcels. He also contends that "[t]he
 
Royal Patent Land Commission Award is surveyed original superior
 
title. boundaries [sic] can not be altered or re-surveyed
 
replacing the whole."
 
The maps which Maio contends are incorrect were 
originally filed with WHLP's December 31, 2007 Additional 
Supplement to Motion for Summary Judgment. Specifically, WHLP 
filed a declaration of Hawai' i licensed land surveyor Edgardo 
Valera (Valera), a map of the land that Valera surveys as being is located in LCA 2468:1 TMK (2) 3-3-02-14 and a metes and bounds 
survey description of LCA 2468:1 TMK (2) 3-3-02-14. 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On May 19, 2008, WHLP filed the Submission of Survey
 
Map and Descriptions of LCA 2468:1, which included a map of LCA
 
2468:1 depicting the placement of the land in LCA 2468:1 that
 
falls under TMK (2)3-3-02-01, TMK (2) 3-3-02-14, or TMK (2) 3-3­
02-26, as well as three metes and bounds descriptions of the land
 
in the previously mentioned tax maps. Valera created both the
 
map and the descriptions.
 
Conversely, Maio did not file a declaration consisting 
of his own personal knowledge regarding the metes and bounds of 
LCA 2468:1 or the parcel placement within LCA 2468:1. Maio also 
did not retain his own surveyor to challenge the declaration of 
WHLP's surveyor. It appears Maio is relying on the information 
contained in his pleadings to rebut the maps and descriptions 
created by WHLP's expert, Valera. However, Maio cannot rely on 
his unverified pleadings to oppose WHLP's motion for summary 
judgment because pleadings are not evidence within the scope of 
the summary judgment rule. See Tri-S Corp. v. Western World Ins. 
Co., 110 Hawai' i 473, 494 n.9, 135 P.3d 82, 103 n.9 (2006). 
Under Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 56(e), in 
order for Maio to have properly rebutted WHLP's evidence regarding the placement of the TMKs within LCA 2468:1, which 
included maps, descriptions of LCA 2468:1, and a declaration by 
an expert, Maio needed to respond by filing opposing affidavits 
or a declaration which "shall set forth such facts as would be 
admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the 
affiant is competent to testify[.]" HRCP Rule 56(e). Maio 
failed to respond as required under HRCP Rule 56(e). 
The circuit court properly granted WHLP's motion for
 
summary judgment against Maio. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the February 9, 2009 Final
 
Judgment and Decree entered in the Circuit Court of the Second
 
6
