STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
CHESTER PACQUING, Defendant-Appellee
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CR. NO. 08-1-0556)
ORDER DENYING DEFENDANT-APPELLEE MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
Upon review of Defendant-Appellee's Motion to
Reconsider the ICA Order Granting State of Hawai# i's Motion to
Supplement Record on Appeal with Transcript (Motion for
Reconsideration) filed on June 10, 2010, it appears that the
Motion for Reconsideration seeks a reconsideration of the
approval of the State of Hawai #i's Motion to Supplement Record
(Motion to Supplement) filed on May 27, 2010.  The deadline to
file a motion for reconsideration from the May 27,2010 ruling
approving the Motion to Supplement was ten days from the date of
the ruling and expired on June 7, 2010.  Hawai #i Rules of
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 40(a).  The Motion for
Reconsideration was not timely filed.
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendant-
Appellee's Motion to Reconsider the ICA Order Granting State of
Hawai#i's Motion to Supplement Record on Appeal with Transcript
filed on June 10, 2010 is denied.  
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, June 21, 2010.
