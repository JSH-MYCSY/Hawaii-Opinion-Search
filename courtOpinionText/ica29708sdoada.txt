  In Skochko's second point of error, he contends the district court2
erred by convicting him, but he presents no argument to support his claim.

STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
GREGORY SKOCHKO, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. 1DTA-08-07834)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Gregory Skochko (Skochko) appeals
from the Judgment filed on February 26, 2009 in the District
Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (district court).1 
The district court convicted Skochko of Operating a Vehicle Under
the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii
Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 291E-61(a)(1) and (3) and (b)(1) (Supp.
2008).
On appeal, Skochko contends the district court erred by
denying his oral motion to dismiss the charge because the written
complaint and oral charge failed to state an essential element of
the offense, i.e that Skochko operated or assumed actual physical
control of a vehicle upon a public way, street, road, or
highway.2
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, asNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Skochko's
point of error as follows:
"[T]he operation of a vehicle on a public way, street,
road, or highway is an attendant circumstance of the offense of
OVUII, and is therefore an element of the offense."  State v.
Wheeler, 121 Hawai# i 383, 393, 219 P.3d 1170, 1180 (2009).  The
failure to allege that at the time of the offense, Skochko was
driving a vehicle upon a public way, street, road, or highway
rendered the charge deficient.  Id.
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment filed on
February 26, 2009 in the District Court of the First Circuit,
Honolulu Division, is vacated and this case is remanded to the
district court with instructions to dismiss the charge without
prejudice.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, February 24, 2010.
