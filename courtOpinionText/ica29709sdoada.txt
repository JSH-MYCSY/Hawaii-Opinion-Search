v.
JESSICA E. ROBERTS, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
HONOLULU DIVISION
(CASE NO. 1DTA-08-08840)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Jessica E. Roberts (Roberts)
appeals from the Judgment entered on February 18, 2009, in the
District Court of the First Circuit (district court).1/
Roberts was convicted of Operating a Vehicle Under the
Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii
Revised Statutes ยง 291E-61(a)(1) and (b)(1) (Supp. 2008). 
On appeal, Roberts contends that the district court
erred by denying her motion to dismiss the OVUII charge because
the written complaint and oral charge failed to state an
essential element of the offense, namely, that Roberts operated
or assumed actual physical control of a vehicle upon a public
way, street, road, or highway.2/
Upon review of the record and the briefs submitted by
the parties, we resolve Roberts's point of error as follows:
 "[T]he operation [or assumption of actual physical
control] of a vehicle on a public way, street, road, or highway
is an attendant circumstance of the offense of OVUII, and is
therefore an element of the offense."  State v. Wheeler, 121
Hawai#i 383, 393, 219 P.3d 1170, 1180 (2009).  The OVUII charge
brought against Roberts was insufficient because it failed to
allege that Roberts operated or assumed actual physical control
of a vehicle upon a public way, street, road, or highway.  Id.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
2Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the February 18, 2009,
Judgment of the district court is vacated and the matter is
remanded to the district court with instructions to dismiss the
charge without prejudice.
