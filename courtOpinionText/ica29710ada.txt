United Public Workers, AFSCME, Local 646, AFL-CIO, (Union) and
 
against the City pursuant to the following orders:

On appeal, the City contends:
 (1) The circuit court erred when it found in favor of
 
Union pursuant to (a) the Order Denying City's Motion to Vacate
 Pre-Award Decision, wherein the court stated that Arbitrator
 
Walter Ikeda (the Arbitrator) "did not exceed his powers or
 
authority by rendering the April 16, 2008 [Pre-Award Decision]";

which the court found that the Arbitrator "acted within the scope
 
of his authority by sustaining the class grievances for
 
violations of Sections 1, 14, and 35 of the collective bargaining
 
agreements" (CBAs)3; and (c) the Order Denying City's Motion to
 
Vacate Final Award, wherein the court found that the Arbitrator
 "did not exceed his powers or authority by rendering the
 
January 14, 2009 [Final Award]."
 
The City contends that because Union's Step 1 and Step
 
2 grievances mentioned the issue of holiday pay for Unit 1 and
 
Unit 10 members on unpaid leave during a holiday but did not
 
specifically mention the issue of holiday pay for members on
 
workers' compensation leave, the Arbitrator exceeded his
 
authority when, after addressing the issue of holiday pay for
 
members on unpaid leave, he addressed the issue of holiday pay
 
for members who were on workers' compensation leave. 
(2) In the Order Granting Union's Motion to Confirm
 
Pre-Award Decision, the circuit court erred when it confirmed the
 
order of the Arbitrator in the Pre-Award Decision that the 2003
 
Parnell
4 and 2007 Ikeda5 arbitration decisions collaterally
 
estopped the City from contesting the right of Unit 1 and Unit 10
 
members to holiday pay while on unpaid leave or workers'

"the April 16, 2008 [Pre-Award Decision] is not contrary to
 
public policy" and (b) the Order Denying City's Motion to Vacate

decision materially altered the collective bargaining grievance
 
process.

On August 22, 2003, Union filed two class action Step 1
 
grievances against City on behalf of public collective bargaining
 
Units 1 and 10.6 Union alleged violations of Sections 1, 14, 15,
 
23A, 35, and 64 of the Unit 1 and Unit 10 CBAs. At issue was the
 
denial of holiday pay by the City to Unit 1 and Unit 10
 
employees. The holiday pay issue was not resolved at Step 1 or
 
Step 2 of the CBA grievance procedure, and the issue proceeded to
 
binding arbitration pursuant to the CBAs. By agreement of the
 
parties, the two cases were consolidated into a single proceeding
 
before the Arbitrator.

On January 31, 2008, Union submitted a Motion for
 
Summary Disposition to the Arbitrator, seeking a ruling whether
 
two prior arbitration decisions on holiday pay and eligibility,
 
the 2003 Parnell decision and the 2007 Ikeda decision, were final
 
and binding on the City under HRS ÿÿ 89-10.8 (Supp. 2010) and
 
Section 15.20b of the CBAs. Union had contended in its
 
grievances that the 2003 Parnell decision was final and binding
 
on the City under the multi-employer bargaining process.7
 
On April 16, 2008, the Arbitrator issued the Pre-Award 
Decision in favor of Union, finding that even though the City was 
not a party to the 2003 Parnell and 2007 Ikeda cases, it was in 
privity with the State of Hawai» i (State) (which had litigated 
the holiday pay issues in the Parnell and Ikeda cases) and 
therefore, was estopped from contesting the general right of 
Unit 1 and Unit 10 members to holiday pay while on unpaid leave 
of absence pursuant to the 2003 Parnell Decision or while on 
workers' compensation leave pursuant to the 2007 Ikeda Decision. 
On April 21, 2008, Union filed a motion with the
 
circuit court to confirm the Arbitrator's Pre-Award Decision. On
 
May 12, 2008, the City filed a motion to vacate the Pre-Award
 
Decision. On July 2, 2008, the circuit court entered the Order

A. ARBITRATION AWARD
 
The appellate court reviews "the circuit court's ruling
 
on an arbitration award de novo " and is also "mindful that the
 
circuit court's review of arbitral awards must be extremely
 
narrow and exceedingly deferential." Tatibouet v. Ellsworth, 99
 
Hawai» i 226, 233, 54 P.3d 397, 404 (2002) (internal quotation 
marks, citation, and brackets omitted).
 
The appellate court's review of arbitration awards is
 
guided by the following principles:
 
It is well settled that because of the legislative policy to
encourage arbitration and thereby discourage litigation,
judicial review of an arbitration award is confined to the
strictest possible limits. As such, a court has no business
weighing the merits of the arbitration award. Indeed, the
legislature has mandated that a court may vacate an
arbitration award only on the four grounds specified in HRS
§ 658-9,
[8] and may modify or correct an award only on the
three grounds specified in HRS § 658-10. Therefore, HRS
§ 658-8 contemplates a judicial confirmation of the award
issued by the arbitrator, unless the award is vacated,
modified, or corrected in accord with HRS §§ 658-9 and
658-10.
 
Based upon the policy limiting judicial review of
arbitration awards, [the Hawai
»i Supreme Court] has held
that parties who arbitrate a dispute assume all the hazards
of the arbitration process including the risk that the
arbitrators may make mistakes in the application of law and
in their findings of fact. Where arbitration is made in
 
good faith, parties are not permitted to prove that an
arbitrator[] erred as to the law or the facts of the case.

B. SCOPE OF ARBITRATOR'S AUTHORITY
 
"The scope of an arbitrator's authority is determined
 
by agreement of the parties. An arbitrator must act within the
 
scope of the authority conferred upon him by the parties and
 
cannot exceed his power by deciding matters not submitted." 
Clawson v. Habilitat, Inc. , 71 Haw. 76, 78, 783 P.2d 1230, 1231
 
(1989). "[W]here an arbitrator has exceeded his or her powers by
 deciding matters not submitted, [the Hawai» i Supreme Court] has 
held, pursuant to HRS § 658-9(4),
[9] that the resulting
 
arbitration award must be vacated." Tatibouet , 99 Hawai» i at 
235, 54 P.3d at 406. 
When the parties include an arbitration clause in their
collective bargaining agreement, they choose to have
disputes concerning constructions of the contract resolved
by an arbitrator. Unless the arbitral decision does not
 draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement, a
court is bound to enforce the award and is not entitled to
 
review the merits of the contract dispute. This remains so
 even when the basis for the arbitrator's decision may be
ambiguous.
 
W.R. Grace & Co. v. Local Union 759, Int'l Union of United
 
Rubber, Cork, Linoleum & Plastic Workers of Am., 461 U.S. 757,
 
764, 103 S. Ct. 2177, 2182 (1983) (internal quotation marks, 
citations, and brackets omitted).
 
Because the authority of arbitrators is a subject of
collective bargaining, just as is any other contractual
provision, the scope of the arbitrator's authority is itself
a question of contract interpretation that the parties have
delegated to the arbitrator. [The second arbitrator's]
conclusions that [the first arbitrator] acted outside his
jurisdiction and that this deprived [the first arbitrator's]
award of precedential force under the contract draw their
"essence" from the provisions of the collective bargaining
agreement. Regardless of what our view might be of the
correctness of [the second arbitrator's] contractual
interpretation, the Company and the Union bargained for that
interpretation. A federal court may not second-guess it.

C. PUBLIC POLICY
 
A court may not enforce any contract "that is contrary
 
to public policy." Id.  at 766, 103 S. Ct. at 2183. It follows
 
that "[i]f the contract as interpreted [by an arbitrator]
 
violates some explicit public policy, [the courts] are obliged to
 
refrain from enforcing it." Id. Thus, the United States Supreme
 
Court has recognized a public policy exception to the general
 deference given arbitration awards. United Paperworkers Int'l
 
Union, AFL-CIO v. Misco, Inc., 484 U.S. 29, 42-43, 108 S. Ct.
 364, 373-74 (1987) (to refuse to enforce an arbitration award,
 
the alleged violation of public policy must be clearly shown). 
[T]he public policy exception requires a court to determine
that (1) the award would violate some explicit public policy
that is well defined and dominant, and that is ascertained
by reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from
general considerations of supposed public interests, and (2)
the violation of the public policy is clearly shown. Hence,
a refusal to enforce an arbitration award must rest on more
 than speculation or assumption.

Int'l Longshoremen's & Warehousemen's Union v. Sause Bros., Inc.,

A. SCOPE OF ARBITRATOR'S AUTHORITY
 
In its review of arbitration awards, the circuit court 
must afford extreme deference to the arbitrator's ruling. 
Tatibouet , 99 Hawai» i at 233, 54 P.3d at 404. Whether the 
circuit court erred in confirming the Arbitrator's Pre-Award Decision and the Final Award requires an interpretation of HRS 
Chapter 658A -- a question of law reviewable de novo. Tatibouet , 
99 Hawai» i at 233, 54 P.3d at 404. In our review of the circuit 
court's ruling, we are cognizant of the circuit court's 
application of extreme deference. Id.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Because the City and Union agreed under the CBA to have
 
an arbitrator rather than a judge resolve disputes, "it is the
 
arbitrator's view of the facts and of the meaning of the contract
 
that [the City and Union] have agreed to accept." Misco , 484
 
U.S. at 37-38, 108 S. Ct. at 370. "Whether the moving party is
 right or wrong is a question of contract interpretation for the
 
arbitrator." Id.  at 37, 108 S. Ct. at 370. 
Union is certified as the bargaining agent for Unit 1 
and Unit 10 public employee collective bargaining units. Pursuant 
to HRS Chapter 89, the CBAs are multi-party agreements. HRS 
ÿÿ 89-6 (Supp. 2010). Unit 1 and Unit 10 CBAs are signed by the 
designated representatives of Union, the State, the counties, the 
Hawai» i judiciary, and the Hawaii Health Systems Corporation 
board. HRS ÿÿ 89-6(d)(1). Unit 1 and Unit 10 CBAs are substantially the same and are intended to apply uniformly to the 
public employers and the bargaining unit employees. A simple 
majority of the signatories is needed to reach any decision and 
must include at least one county when the bargaining unit itself 
includes employees from more than one county. HRS ÿÿ 89-6(d) As 
part of the process of negotiating CBAs, employer personnel and 
senior management staff meet to discuss issues, create consensus 
positions in negotiating the new contracts, and determine the 
impact of arbitrator decisions in arbitrated cases. 
The CBAs provide a grievance procedure to address any
 
"grievance that arises out of alleged Employer violation,
 
misinterpretation, or misapplication of [the CBA]." CBA Section
 
15.01. If the grievance is not resolved at Step 1 or Step 2 of
 
the grievance procedure, Union may request arbitration. CBA
 Section 15.13a. At the end of the arbitration process, the
 
arbitrator makes a decision and issues an award which "shall be
 
final and binding provided, the award is within the scope of the
 
Arbitrator's authority." CBA Section 15.20b.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
As part of the arbitration procedure set forth in the
 
CBAs, the arbitrator determines the issues to be arbitrated at
 
the hearing.
 
15.18 ISSUES TO BE ARBITRATED
 
15.18a. Within five (5) calendar days after the Arbitrator
has been selected each party may submit a statement of its
view as to the issue(s) to the Arbitrator with a copy to the
other party.
 
15.18b. The Arbitrator shall determine the issue(s) at the
hearing.
 
(Emphasis added.) However, the arbitrator may not consider
 
allegations that were not alleged at Step 1 or Step 2 of the
 
grievance process. Section 15.20b.4. 
The CBAs define the scope of the arbitrator's authority
 
in rendering his decision and award:
 
15.20 AWARD.
 
15.20a. The Arbitrator shall render the award in writing no
later than thirty (30) calendar days after the conclusion of
the hearing(s) and submission of briefs provided, however,
the submission of briefs may be waived by mutual agreement
between the Union and the Employer.
 
15.20b. The award of the Arbitrator shall be final and
 
binding provided, the award is within the scope of the
Arbitrator's authority as described as follows:
 
15.20b.1. The Arbitrator shall not have the power to add
to, subtract from, disregard, alter, or modify any of the
sections of this [CBA].
 
15.20b.2. The Arbitrator shall be limited to deciding
whether the Employer has violated, misinterpreted, or
misapplied any of the sections of this [CBA].
 
15.20b.3. A matter that is not specifically set forth in
this [CBA] shall not be subject to arbitration.
 
15.20b.4. The Arbitrator shall not consider allegations
which have not been alleged in Steps 1 and 2.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
The City argues that the only issue before the
 
Arbitrator was holiday pay for bargaining unit members on leaves
 
of absence without pay, not holiday pay for members on workers'
 
compensation leave. The City claims that when the Arbitrator
 
also ruled on the issue of holiday pay for members on leave under
 
10
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
workers' compensation, the Arbitrator violated Section 15.20b.4
 
of the CBA by considering allegations that had not been alleged
 
at Step 1 and Step 2 of the grievance procedure.
 
In response, Union contends that CBA Section 15.18
 
expressly grants the Arbitrator the authority to determine the
 
issues being addressed at the arbitration hearing. Union argues
 
that the grievances were not as narrowly construed as suggested
 
by the City and points to paragraph f of the grievance form,
 
which states: "No state statute on leaves of absences (with or
 
without pay) renders employees ineligible (or disqualified) for
 
holiday pay and benefits by reason of their use or receipt of
 
leaves of absences (with or without pay )." (Emphasis added.) 
Union argues that paragraph f, by extension, includes leaves of
 
absences under workers' compensation. Union points out that the
 
grievances broadly alleged violations of Sections 1, 14, 15, 23A,
 
35, and 64 of the Unit 1 and Unit 10 CBAs, which include prior
 
rights to paid holidays under Sections 14 and 35.
 
The Arbitrator, in the Pre-Award Decision, determined
 
that the consolidated cases alleging violations under the Unit 1
 
and Unit 10 CBAs were about "the issue of holiday pay eligibility
 
and benefits." He noted that the grievances challenged the
 
alleged failure of the City to give members paid holidays as
 
provided for by statute and the CBAs. According to the
 
Arbitrator, "[i]t was evident that the principal gravamen of the
 
grievances were about entitlement to holiday pay in a number of
 
leave situations that an employee was using such as leave without
 
pay or workers['] compensation leave where the worker is on leave
 
but receiving a monetary stipend in lieu of pay." The Arbitrator
 
dismissed the City's contention that it had not been sufficiently
 
notified that the grievances asserted employees' entitlement to
 
holiday pay while on workers' compensation leave by pointing out
 
that Union's interrogatories and requests for admissions
 
specifically asked about employees on workers' compensation leave
 
as well as those on leave without pay.

The Arbitrator must look to the CBA itself in making 
his decision and award. Univ. of Hawaii Prof'l Assembly ex. rel.

(1983). The arbitrator's award "is legitimate only so long as it 
draws its essence from the [CBA]." Id. (quoting United 
Steelworkers of Am. v. Enter. Wheel & Car Corp., 363 U.S. 593, 
597, 80 S. Ct. 1358, 1361 (1960)). In Tatibouet, the Hawai» i 
Supreme Court stated that the United States Court of Appeals for 
the Ninth Circuit had interpreted the phrase "draws its essence" 
to mean that the "reviewing court must look to the arbitration 
clause, the words of the contract, and the conduct of the 
parties." Tatibouet , 99 Hawai» i at 235 n.7, 54 P.3d at 406 n.7. 
But even in this process, "the circuit court's review of arbitral 
awards must be extremely narrow and exceedingly deferential." 
Id. at 233, 54 P.3d at 404 (internal quotation marks, citation, 
and brackets omitted). 
In the instant case, the arbitration clause of the CBA
 
provides for the arbitrator to determine the issues to be
 
addressed at the arbitration hearing. The CBA states that the
 
arbitrator cannot consider allegations not raised at Step 1 or
 
Step 2 of the grievance procedure. The Arbitrator determined
 
that the grievances alleged violations related to the broad issue
 
of holiday pay eligibility and benefits and, thus, could be
 
considered at arbitration. The Arbitrator pointed to the
 
interrogatories and requests for admissions, as well as the
 
City's responses, as behavior that indicated the understanding of
 
both parties that the grievances were about holiday pay for
 
members on leave without pay and also for members on workers'
 
compensation leave. 
"[T]he scope of the arbitrator's authority is itself a
 
question of contract interpretation that the parties have
 
delegated to the arbitrator." W.R. Grace , 461 U.S. at 765, 103
 
S. Ct. at 2183. We conclude that the Arbitrator's award drew its
 essence from the CBA and the Arbitrator acted within the scope of
 
12
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
his authority in determining the issues submitted for
 
arbitration. The circuit court did not err when it held that the
 
Arbitrator had not exceeded his authority because the scope of
 
the grievances and effect of prior arbitration awards were
 
"questions of contract interpretation and application which have
 
been delegated to the arbitrator to decide."
 
B. COLLATERAL ESTOPPEL/ISSUE PRECLUSION
 
The City contends the circuit court erred when it
 
found, pursuant to the Order Granting Union's Motion to Confirm
 
the Pre-Award Decision, that the Arbitrator correctly ordered:
 
The City and County of Honolulu is estopped from
contesting the general right of Unit One and Unit Ten
members to holiday pay while on unpaid leave of absence as
determined by Arbitrator Parnell in the matter of United
Public Workers vs. the University of Hawaii issued on
January 22, 2003 and the right to receive holiday pay while
on workers['] compensation leave as determined by Arbitrator
Ikeda in United Public Workers on behalf of Yong Mi Han
against the University of Hawaii on August 30, 2007.
 
In 2003 Parnell, arbitrator Edward Parnell issued a 
decision and award against the University of Hawai» i and in favor 
of Union bargaining Unit 1, determining that "employees on leave 
of absences without pay before, during, or after a holiday 
observance were entitled to holiday pay under Section 35." After 
the 2003 Parnell decision and award was confirmed by the circuit 
court, it "became final and binding under Section 15.20b of the 
[CBAs]." Union then requested public employers to comply with 
CBA Sections 1 and 35 as interpreted by the 2003 Parnell ruling 
and provide bargaining Unit 1 and Unit 10 employees "with their 
holiday entitlements (where they are on leave of absences without 
pay before, during, or after the holiday observance)." When the 
City refused to comply, Union filed the two August 22, 2003 
grievances at issue in the present case. 
The 2007 Ikeda decision involved a University of 
Hawai» i Unit 1 member who was denied holiday pay while on 
workers' compensation leave of absence and receiving temporary 
disability benefits. On behalf of the member, Union filed a 
13
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
grievance form nearly identical in its description as the
 
grievances at issue in the instant case. In his Decision and
 
Award, the Arbitrator described the 2003 Parnell case as being
 
about a member desiring to be paid for a holiday where, following
 
a period of leave without pay, the member had returned to work on
 
the day after the holiday. The Arbitrator determined that the
 
employer could have, in good faith, seen it as a narrow holding
 
that did not apply to a case about holiday pay while on workers'
 
compensation leave. The Arbitrator concluded that "the general
 
principle of entitlement to holiday pay while on workers'
 
compensation benefits should be applicable to all employees of
 
bargaining unit 1 in state and county employment." He also
 
determined that "[a] reasonable person would have a substantial
 
basis to believe that paid holidays are an established right . .
 
. when they are described in a statute and incorporated by
 
reference by reason of section 14.01 of the CBAs dating back to
 
1972."
 
The City argues that the doctrine of collateral
 
estoppel, or issue preclusion,10 was improperly applied because
 
the City was not a party to the 2003 Parnell or 2007 Ikeda
 decisions.
11 The City maintains that it was not given notice of
 
the grievances set forth in those cases nor was it given an
 opportunity to be heard, violating its right to due process.
 
Issue preclusion prevents the relitigation of a fact or
 
issue that was determined in a prior case on a different cause of
 
action between the same parties or their privies. Bremer v.
 
10  In Exotics Hawai »i-Kona, Inc. v. E.I. Dupont De Nemours & Co., 104
Hawai»i 358, 365 n.14, 90 P.3d 250, 257 n.14 (2004), the Hawai »i Supreme Court,
in an effort to avoid confusion, chose to use the term "issue preclusion"
rather than "collateral estoppel." We do likewise. 
11 We note, in the first instance, that "vacatur is not a proper remedy
for arbitrators' imperfect understanding of law." Tatibouet , 99 Hawai »i at 
236, 54 P.3d at 407. Thus, even if the Arbitrator committed a legal error inreaching his final decision, the award may not be vacated on that ground. See 
id. However, inasmuch as the City's public policy argument is based also on
the contention that the Arbitrator applied issue preclusion in violation of
due process, we address the argument here.

Weeks, 104 Hawai» i 43, 54, 85 P.3d 150, 161 (2004). "The 
doctrine is intended to protect litigants from the burden of 
relitigating an identical issue with the same party or his privy 
and promotes judicial economy by preventing needless litigation." 
Tradewind Ins. Co. v. Stout , 85 Hawai» i 177, 184, 938 P.2d 1196, 
1203 (App. 1997). "[I]ssue preclusion and claim preclusion share 
the common goals of preventing inconsistent results, preventing a 
multiplicity of suits, and promoting finality and judicial 
economy." Exotics Hawaii-Kona, 104 Hawai» i at 365, 90 P.3d at 
257 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
The party wishing to assert issue preclusion bears the
 
burden of establishing that
 
(1) the issue decided in the prior adjudication is identical
to the one presented in the action in question; (2) there is
a final judgment on the merits; (3) the issue decided in the
prior adjudication was essential to the final judgment; and
(4) the party against whom [issue preclusion] is asserted
was a party or in privity with a party to the prior
adjudication[.]
 
Dorrance v. Lee , 90 Hawai» i 143, 149, 976 P.2d 904, 910 (1999). 
The City contends that because the University of 
Hawai» i, not the City, was the defendant in the 2003 Parnell and 
2007 Ikeda cases, the fourth element of issue preclusion has not 
been met. And because the City was not a party to the prior 
adjudication, the City argues that issue preclusion violated its 
right to notice and an opportunity to be heard. 
In Tradewind , this court considered equitable factors
 
to ensure that the due process rights of a non-party to the prior
 
decision were not violated when issue preclusion was applied:
 
[D]ue process requires that the estopped party have an
identity or community of interest with, and adequate
representation by, the losing party in the first action and
reasonably expects to be bound by the prior adjudication.
[Safeco Ins. Co. of Am. v. Yon, 796 P.2d 1040, 1044 (Idaho
Ct. App. 1990).] When applying this rule, . . . various
equitable factors . . . must be considered:
 
Whether it would be generally unfair in the second
case to use the result of the first case, whether
assertion of the plea of estoppel by a stranger to the
judgment would create anomalous result[s], whether the
party adversely affected by the [issue preclusion]
 
15
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
offers a sound reason why he should not be bound by
the judgment, and whether the first case was litigated
strenuously or with vigor.
 
Id. at 1045.
 
85 Hawai» i at 187-88, 938 P.2d at 1206-07 (brackets in original 
omitted). 
Tradewind's insured, Romel, was convicted in a criminal 
case of attempted second degree murder of Stout. Id.  at 179, 938 
P.2d at 1198. Romel lived with his parents (the Castros) at the 
time he shot Stout. Id. at 179 n.3, 938 P.2d at 1198 n.3. 
Tradewind filed a complaint for declaratory action against Romel, 
the Castros, and Stout, seeking a judgment that Tradewind, the 
insurer under the Castros' insurance policy, had no duty to 
defend or indemnify its insured (Romel) or to pay Stout for 
personal injuries she suffered when Romel shot her. Id.  at 179, 
938 P.2d at 1198. Tradewind moved for summary judgment, and the 
circuit court ruled that Tradewind had no duty to defend Romel. 
Id. Stout appealed. Id. The Hawai» i Supreme Court stated that 
one of the issues on appeal was "whether, as a result of Romel's 
criminal conviction, Stout was [prevented by issue preclusion] 
from litigating the question of whether her bodily injuries were 
or were not 'expected or intended' by Romel." Id. at 181, 938 
P.2d at 1200. The supreme court considered the equitable factors and held that "[t]he policies of promoting judicial economy by 
minimizing repetitive litigation, preventing inconsistent 
judgments which undermine the integrity of the judicial system, 
and protecting against vexatious litigation" supported the 
application of issue preclusion. Id.  at 188, 938 P.2d at 1207 
(footnote omitted). 
We also note that in Exotics Hawai» i-Kona, the Hawai» i 
Supreme Court expanded the doctrine of issue preclusion by 
recognizing nonmutual offensive issue preclusion. 104 Hawai» i at 
371, 90 P.3d at 263. Under the traditional mutuality doctrine, 
"neither party could use a prior judgment as an estoppel against 
16
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the other unless both parties were bound by the judgment." Id. 
at 365, 90 P.3d at 257 (internal quotation marks and citation 
omitted). Nonmutual offensive issue preclusion eliminates the 
requirement of mutuality of interest and expands the concept of 
privity and mutuality to bind non-parties. Id.  at 369, 90 P.3d 
at 261. The supreme court held that the party asserting issue 
preclusion must satisfy the four-part test set forth in Dorrance , 
and the trial court must ensure that preclusion will not contravene public policy or result in manifest injustice. 
Exotics Hawai» i-Kona, 104 Hawai» i at 373, 90 P.3d at 265. 
Applying the Dorrance test in the instant case, the
 
Arbitrator determined that the first three Dorrance  factors were
 
met: the issues decided in the 2003 Parnell and 2007 Ikeda cases
 regarding holiday pay were identical to the issues being decided
 
in the instant case, final judgments were issued on the merits in
 
both prior cases with the awards confirmed by the circuit court,
 
and the issue of the right to holiday pay was essential to the
 
final judgments. Regarding the fourth factor, the Arbitrator
 
determined that even though the City was not a party in the prior
 
cases, "it [was] in privity under present doctrine to the
 
[State]
12 which litigated [the issue of holiday pay in the 2003
 
Parnell and 2007 Ikeda cases]."
 
The Hawai» i Supreme Court has noted that "[a]s to 
privity, current decisions look directly to the reasons for 
holding a person bound by a judgment." Bush v. Watson  81 
Hawai» i 474, 480, 918 P.2d 1130, 1136 (1996) (quoting 18 Charles 
Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Edward Cooper, Federal Practice 
and Procedure § 4436, at 339 (1981)). And where privity is found, "the nonparty should reasonably expect to be bound by the 
prior adjudication." City of Martinez v. Texaco Trading & 
12 On the 2003 Parnell and 2007 Ikeda grievance forms, the employer was
identified as the State and the department was identified as the University of
Hawai»i. In the Pre-Award Decision, the Arbitrator referred to the State and
University of Hawai »i interchangeably in reference to these two cases.

Transp., Inc. , 353 F.3d 758, 764 (9th Cir. 2003) (internal
 
quotation marks and citation omitted). 
The Arbitrator considered the following facts in 
determining that the City was in privity with the State. The 
State and the City were members of the collective employer 
group13 negotiating the multi-party CBAs, pursuant to HRS ÿÿ 89­
6(d). The State and the City were both signatories to the negotiated CBAs. Unit 1 employees, whether employed by the City 
or the State, are entitled to holiday pay under the same Hawai» i 
statutes and CBAs. The Arbitrator found that the litigators for the State in the 2003 Parnell and 2007 Ikeda cases were well-
qualified and provided "comprehensive briefs . . . [and] well-
conceived arguments" and the decisions in arbitration cases 
"where there is no reasonable uncertainty as to the meaning of 
certain provisions" have been accepted as binding. 
The arbitrator's role is to interpret the CBA and the
 
court's role "is to determine whether  the arbitrator interpreted
 
the [CBA], not  whether he did so correctly." Hawaii Teamsters &
 
Allied Workers Union, Local 996 v. United Parcel Serv., 241 F.3d
 
1177, 1178 (9th Cir. 2001). "[C]ourts have no business
 overruling [the arbitrator] because their interpretation of the
 
contract is different from his." United Steelworkers , 363 U.S.
 
at 599, 80 S. Ct. at 1362. "[A]s long as the arbitrator is even
 arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within
 
the scope of his authority," a court may not overturn his
 
decision. Misco , 484 U.S. at 38, 108 S. Ct. at 371.
 
The Arbitrator found that the interests of the City in
 
the instant grievances were identical to the State's in its
 
litigation of the 2003 Parnell and 2007 Ikeda cases. To
 
relitigate the issue of holiday pay would violate the public
 
policy goal of issue preclusion to prevent inconsistent results
 
The members of the collective employer group included: The State,
the Judiciary, the City and County of Honolulu, County of Maui, County of
Hawai»i, County of Kauai, and Hawaii Health Systems Corporation.

C. REASONABLE COSTS AND ATTORNEY'S FEES
 
The City contends the circuit court erred when it found
 
that reasonable costs and attorney's fees were authorized
 pursuant to HRS ÿÿÿÿ 658A-17(d),
14 658A-21(b),15 and 658A-25(b) and
 
(c)16 and the Arbitrator did not disregard CBA Section 15.21.17
 
14 HRS ÿÿ 658A-17(d) provides in relevant part:
 
HRS ÿÿ658A-17 Witnesses; subpoenas; depositions; discovery.
. . . .

(c), the arbitrator may . . . take action against a noncomplying
party to the extent a court could if the controversy were the
subject of a civil action in this State.
 
15 HRS ÿÿ 658A-21(b) provides:
 
HRS ÿÿ658A-21 Remedies; fees and expenses of arbitration

. . . .
 
(b) An arbitrator may award reasonable attorney's fees and
other reasonable expenses of arbitration if such an award is
authorized by law in a civil action involving the same claim or by
the agreement of the parties to the arbitration proceeding.
 
16 HRS ÿÿ 658A-25 provides in relevant part:
 
HRS ÿÿ658A-25 Judgment on award; attorney's fees and
litigation expenses.
 
. . . .
 
(b) A court may allow reasonable costs of the motion and
subsequent judicial proceedings.
 
(c) On application of a prevailing party to a contested
judicial proceeding under section 658A-22 [Confirmation of award],
658A-23 [Vacating award], or 658A-24 [Modification or correction
of award], the court may add reasonable attorney's fees and other
reasonable expenses of litigation[.]
 
17 CBA Section 15.21 provides: "The fees of the Arbitrator, the cost
of transcription and other necessary general costs, shall be shared equally by
the Employer and the Union. Each party will pay the cost of presenting its
own case and the cost of any transcript that it requests."
 
19
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
In the Final Award, the Arbitrator awarded Union
 
"reimbursement for extraordinary attorney[']s fees related to
 
additional discovery related motions . . . for thirty hours . . .
 
in addition to the previous award of 15 hours . . . made on
 
December 19, 2007." The City does not address the December 2007
 
fifteen-hour award, but only argues that the Arbitrator exceeded
 
his authority when he awarded Union thirty hours of attorney's
 
fees to prepare its September 18, 2008 motion for discovery
 
sanctions.
 
The City argues that the attorney's fees claimed by
 
Union were for the preparation of Union's reply brief, a
 
necessary general cost per CBA 15.21, and not the preparation of
 
motions related to discovery sanctions. The City points to the
 
affidavit of Union's attorney where the attorney details the
 
breakdown of his services, indicating that much of the time
 
charged was for preparation of Union's September 11, 2008 reply
 
brief in support of its "Motion for Arbitration Decision and
 
Award, Back Pay, Ten Percent Interest, and Attorney's Fees" filed
 
on July 25, 2008 in the arbitration case. 
Union, on the other hand, claims that these fees were 
not necessary general costs, but were sanctions in the form of 
attorney's fees. Union notes that under HRS ÿÿ 658A-17(d), the 
arbitrator is authorized to impose sanctions on the noncomplying 
party "to the extent a court could if the controversy were the 
subject of a civil action in this State." Under Hawai» i Rules of 
Civil Procedure Rule 37(a)(4)(A), reasonable expenses including attorney's fees are allowed to the moving party unless the other 
party can show that its non-disclosure or lack of response is 
substantially justified or that the award of expenses is unjust. 
It is within the Arbitrator's authority to impose
 
discovery sanctions. Even if some of the hours should have been
 
credited as necessary general costs, the circuit court and this
 
20
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
court are not free to vacate the orders, as requested by the
 
City. Daeufer, 66 Haw. at 225, 659 P.2d at 728 ("[T]he fact that
 
an arbitrator . . . enters an award that is contrary to the
 evidence adduced[] is insufficient grounds for judicial
 
reversal."). 
D. PUBLIC POLICY
 
The City contends that the arbitration award should be
 
vacated under the public policy exception to the general rule of
 
giving deference to the arbitrator.
 
To apply the public policy exception, a court must find 
that the award violated an explicit, well-defined, and dominant 
public policy and the violation was clearly established. 
Inlandboatmen's Union , 77 Hawai» i at 193-94, 881 P.2d at 1261-62 
(citing to Misco, 484 U.S. at 43-44, 108 S. Ct. at 373-74). The 
court's decision to vacate an arbitration award must be based on 
more than speculation or assumption. Inlandboatmen's Union , 77 
Hawai» i at 194, 881 P.2d at 1262. 
The City argues that the Arbitrator violated public
 
policy by applying issue preclusion in violation of due process. 
Inasmuch as issue preclusion has been previously discussed and
 
determined not to have been wrongly applied, the public policy
 
exception is inapplicable.
 
The City also argues that the Arbitrator's award
 
violated public policy because the Arbitrator decided issues not
 
submitted to him, thus exceeding his scope of authority in
 
violation of public policy. The scope of the Arbitrator's
 
authority was previously discussed, and we concluded that the
 
Arbitrator did not exceed his scope of authority. Therefore, in
 
this regard, there was no violation of public policy.
 
The City did not establish that the award violated
 
public policy, and the circuit court did not err when it
 
confirmed the Pre-Arbitration Award and Final Award.
