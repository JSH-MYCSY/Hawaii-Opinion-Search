NO. 29721
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
JACK SIGAFUSS, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 07-1-1750)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Jack Sigafuss (Sigafuss) appeals
 
from the February 20, 2009 judgment of the Circuit Court of the
 
1
First Circuit (circuit court)  in favor of Defendant-Appellee
State of Hawai' i. 
Sigafuss is a pro se prisoner who currently resides in
 
a prison facility in Florida. 
Sigafuss filed a civil suit
 
against the State alleging negligence in the State's failure to
 
provide appropriate medical treatment for Sigafuss's broken jaw
 
and appropriate mental health services while Sigafuss was
 
incarcerated at Oahu Community Correctional Center in January
 
2006. At the conclusion of a non-jury trial, the circuit court
 
entered judgment in favor of the State and against Sigafuss.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Sigafuss's points of error as follows:
 
Sigafuss's briefs do not adhere to Hawai' i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) requirements on several grounds. His 
opening brief does not set forth a concise statement of the 
points of error, it omits record citations in the statement of 
the case, and Sigafuss failed to append a copy of the lower 
court's final judgment and findings of fact and conclusions of 
law. See HRAP Rule 28(b). While this court could affirm the 
circuit court's judgment on this basis alone, Hawai' i appellate 
courts have a policy of deciding cases on the merits where 
possible. See Hous. Fin. & Dev. Corp. v. Ferguson, 
91 Hawai' i 81, 85-86, 979 P.2d 1107, 1111-12 (1999). 
As best we can discern from Sigafuss's briefs, he
 
claims that the State acted negligently regarding the diagnosis
 and treatment of his alleged injuries. However, Sigafuss has
 
failed to point to any errors in the proceedings before the
 
circuit court. As Sigafuss has not provided transcripts of the
 
trial, in violation of HRAP Rule 10(b), we have no basis upon
 
which to adequately conduct a plain error review. Hawaiian Trust
 
Co., Ltd. v. Cowan, 4 Haw. App. 166, 172, 663 P.2d 634, 638
 (1983) (ruling that the trial court's findings and conclusions
 
shall be left undisturbed where omission of the transcripts
 
precludes the court from determining whether the trial court's
 
findings are clearly erroneous).
 
Sigafuss offers no reason for us to conclude that the 
trial court erred in its judgment and has failed to carry the 
burden of showing reversible error in the record on appeal. 
Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai' i 225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 
558 (1995) (the burden "is upon appellant in an appeal to show

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
error by reference to matters in the record, and he or she has
 
the responsibility of providing an adequate transcript") 
(brackets and internal quotation marks omitted)).
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the judgment entered on
 
February 20, 2009 in the Circuit Court for the First Circuit is
 affirmed.
