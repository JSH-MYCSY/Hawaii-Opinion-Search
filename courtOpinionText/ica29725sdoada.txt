NO. 29725
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
DAVID GARCIA aka Howard Garcia, Petitioner-Appellant,
v.
 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P. NO. 08-1-0012 (Cr. No. 96-1330))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant David Garcia aka Howard Garcia
 
(Garcia) appeals from the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law
 
and Order Denying Petitioner's January 10, 2008 Nonconforming
 
Petition for Post-Conviction Relief" (Order) filed on March 18,
 
2009 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court).1
 
On appeal, Garcia contends (1) the circuit court erred 
by concluding that recalculation of his detention credit, as 
specified in State v. Tauiliili, 96 Hawai 'i 195, 29 P.3d 914 
(2001), did not violate the ex post facto clause of the United 
States Constitution and his due process rights; (2) Tauiliili 
may not be applied retroactively; and (3) a review of the 
transcript from his sentencing hearing indicates that his 
detention credit would be applied to his consecutive term. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude that
 
Garcia's appeal is without merit.
 
"Retroactive application of a law that imposes a
 
greater punishment than the law in effect when the crime was
 
committed is forbidden by the Ex Post Facto clauses of the
 
Constitution." Davis v. Moore, 772 A.2d 204, 215-16 (D.C. 2001)

(footnote omitted). "The United States Supreme Court has made it 
clear that the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto 
measures applies only to legislative enactments." State v. Jess, 
117 Hawai 'i 381, 407, 184 P.3d 133, 159 (2008). Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) § 706-671 was first enacted in 1972 by Act 9, § 1, 
and to date the language remains the same (except for a gender 
change). Tauiliili expressed an interpretation of HRS § 706-671 
and did not change its statutory language or any prior ruling on its effect. Since HRS § 706-671 has not changed since Garcia 
committed his offenses, there is no ex post facto prohibition 
against applying Tauiliili to Garcia's sentence. Therefore, the 
circuit court correctly concluded that the Hawai
'i Paroling 
Authority (HPA) did not violate the ex post facto clause when it 
applied Tauiliili to correct Garcia's sentence. 
"[L]imitations on ex post facto judicial decisionmaking 
are inherent in the notion of due process." Jess, 117 Hawai 'i at 
407, 184 P.3d at 159 (internal quotation marks and citation 
omitted). The test for analyzing whether a newly announced 
judicial doctrine can apply retroactively is grounded in concepts 
of notice and foreseeability. Id. at 408, 184 P.3d at 160 
(citing to Rogers v. Tennessee, 532 U.S. 451, 459 (2001), and Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U.S. 347, 351, 352, & 354-55 
(1697)). "[J]udicial reformation of the law violates the 
principle of fair warning, and hence must not be given 
retroactive effect, only where it is unexpected and indefensible 
by reference to the law which had been expressed prior to the 
conduct in issue." Jess, 117 Hawai
'i at 408, 184 P.3d at 160 
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). "An unforseeable interpretation of a statute that increases 
punishment, if applied retroactively, could violate due process." 
Campbell v. United States Parole Comm'n, 563 F. Supp.2d 23, 26 
(D.D.C. 2008) (citing to Bouie, 378 U.S. at 353-54).
 
Under a Hawai
'i due process analysis as to whether 
application of a judicial decision is unexpected and 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
indefensible, the court focuses on "(1) whether the change 
wrought by the judicial decision is detrimental or remedial to 
the defendant's interests; and (2) whether the change is 
substantive or procedural in nature." Jess, 117 Hawai 'i at 408, 
184 P.3d at 160. 
Under HPA's administrative rules, presentence credit 
could only be applied once. Garcia was sentenced to ten years for each of Counts I through V, Count I to run consecutively to 
Counts II through IV, which were to run concurrently. The 
sentence as a whole was to be served concurrent with Garcia's 
then unexpired term, which terminated in 2001, in another case. 
Garcia's minimum term for each of Counts I through V was seven 
years. Garcia's admission date was March 3, 1998. Thus, Garcia 
must serve his longest concurrent minimum sentence (seven years) 
followed by another seven-year consecutive minimum sentence. In 
accordance with Hawai
'i Administrative Rules (HAR) § 17-1204-172 
(Credit Application Towards Minimum Sentence Expiration Date for Sentenced Felons), Garcia's presentence credit is applied to his 
first seven-year minimum term beginning on March 3, 1998, not to 
each minimum term. 
HAR § 17-1204-17 was promulgated in 1985. In 2001,
 
when the court in Tauiliili stated that presentence credit could
 
only be applied once to consecutive sentences, it was not
 
unexpected that HRS § 706-671 would be interpreted to mean that
 
presentence credit could only be applied once to the aggregate
 
minimum sentence. The holding in Tauiliili was not a reformation
 
or departure from an existing HPA rule. Rather, it was
 
consistent with HPA's longstanding practice of only applying
 
presentence credit once to a minimum sentence expiration date. 
Also, HPA's application of Tauiliili to Garcia was procedural in
 
nature because the application was to correct HPA's prior
 
misapplication of presentence credit in order to conform to the

law as it existed prior to and after Tauiliili. Thus, Garcia's 
due process rights under the Hawai 'i Constitution were not 
violated by the application of Tauiliili in this case. 
Application of Tauiliili did not violate Garcia's due
 
process rights under the United States Constitution. See, e.g.,
 
United States Parole Comm'n v. Noble, 693 A.2d 1084 (D.C. 1997),
 
and Davis. In Noble, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals
 
held that based upon its statutory interpretation of the Good
 
Time Credits Act of 1986 (GTCA), a defendant under the
 
supervision of the United States Parole Commission was not
 
entitled to street time credit after his parole was revoked. 
Noble, 693 A.2d at 1085-94. In Davis, the court stated that its
 
decision in Noble applied retroactively. Davis, 772 A.2d at
 
208-09. Prior to Noble, the District of Columbia Department of
 Corrections gave street time credit after parole was revoked
 
based upon its interpretation of the GTCA. Davis, 772 A.2d at
 
209. The United States Parole Commission disagreed with the
 
District of Columbia Department of Corrections and did not give
 
street time credit after parole was revoked. Id. at 209-10. 
Thus, prisoners were subjected to disparate treatment depending
 on the facility in which they were located, and a legal challenge
 
ensued resulting in Noble. Davis, 772 A.2d at 210-11. After
 
Noble, the District of Columbia Department of Corrections denied
 street time credit after parole was revoked and recalculated
 
sentences based on Noble to all prisoners still in custody. 
Davis, 772 A.2d at 208.
 
The appellants in Davis then filed suit claiming that
 
Noble should not be retroactively applied to appellants because
 
they were in a facility located within the District of Columbia,
 
Noble violated due process and ex post facto clauses of the
 
United States Constitution, and they reasonably relied upon the
 
District of Columbia Department of Corrections' policy to award
 
street time credit after parole revocation. Davis, 772 A.2d at
 
214. The Davis court held, inter alia, that the appellants' due
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
process rights under the United States Constitution were not
 
violated by retroactive application of Noble because the court's
 
statutory interpretation in Noble was not unforeseeable and
 
equitable considerations did not justify only prospective
 
application. Davis, 772 A.2d at 214-15. In addition, the Davis
 
court held that "it is a well established rule that a prisoner
 has no constitutional right to object to the correction of a
 
miscalculation of his sentence." Id. at 219. "Only in rare
 
circumstances have courts allowed the misconstructions of
 officials to estop the proper execution of state or federal law,
 
and such cases have involved prejudice and harm beyond frustrated
 
expectations." Id. (internal quotation marks and citation
 
omitted).
 
Finally, there is nothing in the transcript or Garcia's
 
plea agreement to indicate that the parties agreed that Garcia
 would receive credit for the detention time for each count.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Findings of Fact,
 
Conclusions of Law and Order Denying Petitioner's January 10,
 2008 Nonconforming Petition for Post-Conviction Relief" filed on
 
March 18, 2009 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is
 
affirmed.
