OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
JOSEPH PASION, Defendant-Appellee,
and
 
SHANNON HOOPAI, aka Shannon Ahuna, Defendant
and
 
ACE BAIL BONDS L.L.C.,
Real Party in Interest-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

 
(CR. NO. 08-1-0035)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER

 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Real Party in Interest-Appellant Ace Bail Bonds L.L.C.
 
(ABB) appeals from the "Order Denying Motion to Set Aside Bail
 
Forfeiture, Filed on February 12, 2009" filed on March 9, 2009 in
 
the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court).1 On
 
appeal, ABB contends the circuit court erred in denying the
 Motion to Set Aside Bail Forfeiture and the Motion to Enlarge 
Time to Surrender Defendant-Appellee Joseph Pasion (Pasion) when
 
the court had the authority to do so for good cause.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude ABB's
 
appeal is without merit.
 
HRS ยง 804-51 (Supp. 2009) provides in relevant part: 
1
 The Honorable Dexter D. Del Rosario presided.

ยง804-51 Procedure.  Whenever the court, in any
criminal cause, forfeits any bond or recognizance given in a
criminal cause, the court shall immediately enter up
judgment in favor of the State . . . and shall cause
execution to issue thereon immediately after the expiration
of thirty days from the date that notice is given . . . to
the surety . . . unless, before the expiration of thirty
days from the date that notice is given to the surety, . . .
a motion . . . showing good cause why execution should not
issue upon the judgment, is filed with the court. 
(Emphases added.)
 
Thus, a surety has thirty days after it receives notice
 
of the judgment and order of forfeiture of bail bond to file a
 
motion showing good cause as to why the judgment should not be
 
executed. 
The Hawai 'i Supreme Court in State v. Camara, 81 Hawai 'i 
324, 916 P.2d 1225 (1996), held that good cause "may be satisfied 
by the defendant, prior to the expiration of the thirty-day 
search period: (1) providing a satisfactory reason for his or her 
failure to appear when required; or (2) surrendering or being 
surrendered. Id. at 330, 916 P.2d at 1231 (emphasis added). 
In the instant case, the Judgment and Order of
 
Forfeiture of Bail Bond was filed on November 24, 2008. The
 
record does not indicate the date of notice to ABB of the
 
judgment and order that would start the thirty-day period within
 
which ABB could file a motion showing good cause to stay the
 
execution of the judgment of forfeiture. ABB does not argue that
 
it did not receive the notice, and this is not an issue on
 
appeal.
 
On February 12, 2009, more than two months after the
 
judgment was filed, ABB filed motions to set aside the judgment
 
and to allow more time to find Pasion. ABB failed to show that
 
it timely filed these motions within the thirty-day period
 
required by HRS ยง 804-51. Moreover, the record does not support
 
ABB's claim that it demonstrated good cause for delaying the
 
execution of the judgment.
 
Therefore,

The "Order Denying Motion to Set Aside Bail Forfeiture,
 
Filed on February 12, 2009" filed on March 9, 2009 in the Circuit
 
Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
