I.
 
In October 2004, the State of Hawai
'i Department of 
Education (DOE) issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) to provide 
intensive instructional support services to students with 
educational disabilities. The RFP was "issued under the 
provisions of the Hawaii Revised Statutes [(HRS)], Chapter 103F 
[(Chapter 103F)] and its administrative rules." DOE reserved the 
right to reject proposals for a variety of reasons described in 
the RFP. An applicant could protest the awarding of a contract, 
but only for the agency's failure to follow the procedures and 
rules established by Chapter 103F or for failure to follow "any 
procedure, requirement, or evaluation criterion in [the RFP]." 
The proposals were evaluated according to five categories; 
however, only four of the categories earned points. To be 
eligible for the contract, applicants had to receive a score of 
70 points or better out of a possible score of 100 points. 
ANK submitted a proposal in January 2005. DOE notified
 
ANK on March 31, 2005 that its proposal failed to meet the
 
minimum score of 70 to be considered in the pool of providers. 
ANK protested DOE's decision. On April 29, 2005, DOE informed
 
ANK that all proposals were being re-scored. Upon re-scoring,
 
ANK still failed to meet the minimum score. ANK filed an amended

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
notice of protest on May 18, 2005. On May 31, 2005, ANK met with
 
DOE to informally discuss resolution of its protest and discovery
 
procedures. During June and July of 2005, several requests for
 
information and discovery were made by ANK and denied by DOE. On
 
July 18, 2005, ANK again filed a protest, with exhibits,
 
documenting alleged errors in the evaluation. On July 27, 2005,
 
DOE Acting Educational Specialist Marilyn Jakeway sent a
 
response, to which ANK replied on August 2, 2005. DOE
 
Procurement and Contracts Specialist Christian Butt denied ANK's
 
protest on August 9, 2005.
 
ANK then submitted a request for reconsideration on
 
August 16, 2005. On August 25, 2005, DOE Assistant
 
Superintendent Rae Loui rejected the request, "find[ing] no error
 
on the part of the purchasing agency." Thus, stated Loui, "[t]he
 
findings of the purchasing agency in its decision on the protest
 
are affirmed and upheld. The decision of the head of the
 
purchasing agency is upheld."
 
ANK filed a complaint in the circuit court on
 
September 16, 2005 contesting DOE's decision. ANK filed a First
 
Amended Complaint on September 20, 2005 and a Second Amended
 
Complaint on November 13, 2006. The circuit court entered
 
judgment in favor of DOE and against ANK, and ANK timely
 
appealed.
 
On appeal, ANK contends the circuit court erred in its
 (1) March 20, 2006 "Order Granting in Part and Denying 
in Part Defendant-Appellee's Motion to Dismiss the First Amended Complaint Filed on October 6, 2005" (March 20, 2006 Order) when 
the court found that judicial review under HRS Chapter 91 was 
precluded by HRS § 103F-504 (Supp. 2010) because courts have 
express and inherent power to review agency action under the 
Hawai'i Constitution and HRS § 603-21.9 (1993); and 
(2) October 27, 2008 "Order Denying Plaintiff Alaka' i 
Na Keiki's Motion for Summary Judgment Filed May 9, 2008" (Order 
3
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Denying ANK's MSJ) and (3) October 29, 2008 "Order Granting
 
Defendant's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings or in the
 
Alternative for Summary Judgment Filed on May 9, 2008" (Order
 
Granting Hamamoto's MSJ) because HRS Chapter 103F was
 
unconstitutional, the court had authority to review DOE's
 
decision and underlying actions, DOE was liable in tort due to
 
violations of the statute and its administrative rules, there was
 
a material issue of fact regarding negligent scoring as evidenced
 
by deposition testimony, and the action clearly was not moot.3
 
ANK asks that we (1) vacate the circuit court's
 
March 20, 2006 Order, Order Denying ANK's MSJ, and Order Granting
 
Hamamoto's MSJ and direct the court to enter partial summary
 
judgment in favor of ANK; (2) invalidate HRS Chapter 103F as
 
unconstitutional or, in the alternative, (3) declare that DOE
 
acted unlawfully; (4) enjoin DOE and all contracting agencies
 
from further procurement activities under HRS Chapter 103F
 
pursuant to Count IV (Injunctive Relief) pending the development
 
of interim rules by the court to safeguard constitutional
 
protections and appointment of a special master to review bid
 
protests and make recommended decisions to the circuit court
 
regarding final disposition of protests pending legislative cure
 
of the statute; (5) remand to the circuit court on the issues of
 
damages, legal and equitable remedies pursuant to the tort,
 
declaratory relief, and judicial review claims set out in Counts
 
I, II, and III; and (6) award attorneys' fees, costs, and other
 
relief to ANK as permitted by law.

 ANK also presents separately from its two Points of Error five
"Issues Presented," but does not explain their relationship to the Points of
Error. If these issues were intended as points of error, ANK's counsel isadvised that Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4) was not
followed and that "[p]oints not presented in accordance with this section willbe disregarded, except that the appellate court, at its option, may notice aplain error not presented." HRAP Rule 28(b)(4). We address the "Issues Presented" only insofar as they appear in the argument. ANK's counsel is warned that future non-compliance with HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) may result insanctions against them.

II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
A. Summary Judgment
 
On appeal, the grant or denial of summary judgment is
reviewed de novo. See State ex rel. Anzai v. City and 
County of Honolulu, 99 Hawai' i 508, [515], 57 P.3d 433,
[440] (2002); Bitney v. Honolulu Police Dep't, 96 Hawai' i 
243, 250, 30 P.3d 257, 264 (2001). 
[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and
admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if
any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any
material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law. A fact is material if
 proof of that fact would have the effect of
establishing or refuting one of the essential elements
of a cause of action or defense asserted by the
parties. The evidence must be viewed in the light
most favorable to the non-moving party. In other
 words, we must view all of the evidence and inferences
drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the
party opposing the motion.
 
Kahale v. City and County of Honolulu, 104 Hawai' i 341, 344,
90 P.3d 233, 236 (2004) (citation omitted). 
Nuuanu Valley Ass'n v. City & County of Honolulu, 119 Hawai' i 90, 
96, 194 P.3d 531, 537 (2008).
 
B. Statutory Interpretation
 
The interpretation of a statute is a question of
law that is reviewed de novo.
 
When construing a statute, our foremost
obligation is to ascertain and give effect to
the intention of the legislature, which is to be
obtained primarily from the language contained
in the statute itself. And we must read
 statutory language in the context of the entire
statute and construe it in a manner consistent
 with its purpose.
 
When there is doubt, doubleness of
meaning, or indistinctiveness or uncertainty of
an expression used in a statute, an ambiguity
exists[.]
 
In construing an ambiguous statute, the
meaning of the ambiguous words may be sought by
examining the context with which the ambiguous
words, phrases, and sentences may be compared,
in order to ascertain their true meaning.
Moreover, the courts may resort to extrinsic
aids in determining legislative intent. One
 avenue is the use of legislative history as an
interpretive tool.
 
5
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
[The appellate] court may also consider
the reason and spirit of the law, and the cause
which induced the legislature to enact it [] to
discover its true meaning. Laws in pari
materia, or upon the same subject matter, shall
be construed with reference to each other. What
 is clear in one statute may be called upon in
aid to explain what is doubtful in another.
 
Morgan v. Planning Dep't, County of Kaua' i, 104 Hawai' i 173,
179-80, 86 P.3d 982, 988-89 (2004) (citations and internalquotation marks omitted). 
[W]here an administrative agency is charged with the
responsibility of carrying out the mandate of a
statute which contains words of broad and indefinite
 meaning, courts accord persuasive weight to
administrative construction and follow the same,
unless the construction is palpably erroneous.
 
Id. at 180, 86 P.3d at 989 (citing Ka Pa' akai O Ka ' Aina v. 
Land Use Comm'n, State of Hawai' i, 94 Hawai' i 31, 41, 7 P.3d
1068, 1078 (2000)). Stated differently: 
Where an agency is statutorily responsible for
carrying out the mandate of a statute which containsbroad or ambiguous language, that agency'sinterpretation and application of the statute isgenerally accorded judicial deference on appellatereview. Vail v. Employees' Retirement System, 75 Haw.
42, 59, 856 P.2d 1227, 1237 (1993). However, aninterpretation by an agency of a statute itadministers is not entitled to deference if the interpretation is plainly erroneous and inconsistentwith both the letter and intent of the statutorymandate. Kahana Sunset Owners v. County of Maui, 86 
Hawai'i 66, 72, 947 P.2d 378, 384 (1997). 
TIG Ins. Co. v. Kauhane, 101 Hawai' i 311, 321, 67 P.3d 810,
820 (App. 2003) (brackets and internal quotation marksomitted). 
Haole v. State of Hawai' i, 111 Hawai' i 144, 149-50, 140 P.3d 377, 
382-83 (2006) (some brackets in original and some added).
 
C. Legislative Intent
 
Th appellate court "derives legislative intent
 
primarily from the language of statute and follows the general
 
rule that in the absence of clear legislative intent to the
 
contrary, the plain meaning of the statute will be given effect." 
State v. Akina, 73 Haw. 75, 78, 828 P.2d 269, 271 (1992).
 
D. Mootness
 
"It is axiomatic that mootness is an issue of subject
 
matter jurisdiction. Whether a court possesses subject matter
 
6
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
jurisdiction is a question of law reviewable de novo." Hamilton
 
ex rel. Lethem v. Lethem, 119 Hawai' i 1, 4-5, 193 P.3d 839, 842­
43 (2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
 
E.	 Constitutional Questions
 
The Hawai' i Supreme Court stated in In re Guardianship 
of Carlsmith, 113 Hawai' i 236, 151 P.3d 717 (2007): 
[The appellate court] reviews questions of
constitutional law de novo under the right/wrong standard
and, thus, exercises its own independent constitutional
judgment based on the facts of the case. [The appellate
court] as a general matter, has long adhered to the
proposition that (1) legislative enactments are
presumptively constitutional; (2) a party challenging a
statutory scheme has the burden of showing
unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt; and (3) the
constitutional defect must be clear, manifest, and
unmistakable.
 
Id. at 239, 151 P.3d at 720 (internal quotation marks and
 
citations omitted).
 
III.
 
A.	 UNDER THE HAWAI' I CONSTITUTION, IT IS
CONSTITUTIONAL FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO PRECLUDE 
JUDICIAL REVIEW OF CHAPTER 103F ADMINISTRATIVE PROTEST PROCEEDINGS. 
ANK contends that Chapter 103F is unconstitutional
 
because it gives DOE final adjudicatory power over agency
 
protests.
 
Chapter 103F governs contracts made by state agencies
 
for health and human services. HRS § 103F-101 (Supp. 2010). 
Specifically, HRS §§ 103F-501 (Supp. 2010), 103F-502 (Supp.
 
2010), and 103F-504 provide the statutory requirements for
 
protesting a contract award. The statutes provide in relevant
 
part:
 
§103F-501 Protested awards.  (a) A person who is
aggrieved by an award of a contract may protest a purchasing
agency's failure to follow procedures established by this
chapter[.]
 
. . . .
 
(b) The protest shall be submitted to the head of
the purchasing agency, in writing, within five working days
after the postmark date on the notice of award.
 
7
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(c) The head of the purchasing agency, or a
designee, may settle and resolve a protest by one or more of
the following means:
 
(1) Amending or canceling a request for proposal; 
(2) Terminating the contract which was awarded; 
(3) Initiating a new process to award a contract; 
(4) Declaring the contract null and void from thetime of its award; or 
(5) Affirming the purchasing agency's contract awarddecision. 
This authority shall be exercised in accordance with rules
adopted by the policy board.
 
(d) If the protest is not resolved by mutual
agreement, the head of the purchasing agency, or a designee,
shall promptly issue a decision in writing. The decision
 shall:
 
(1)	 State the reasons for the action taken; and
 
(2)	 Inform the protesting person of the protester's
right to reconsideration as provided in this
part.
 
A copy of the written decision shall be mailed or otherwise
furnished to the person who initiated the protest.
 
(e) A decision under subsection (d) shall be final
and conclusive unless a request for reconsideration is
submitted to the chief procurement officer under section
103F-502.
 
§103F-502 Right to request reconsideration.  (a) A
 
request for reconsideration of a decision of the head of the
purchasing agency under section 103F-501 shall be submitted
to the chief procurement officer not later than five working
days after the receipt of the written decision, and shall
contain a specific statement of the factual and legal
grounds upon which reversal or modification is sought.
 
. . . .
 
(c) The chief procurement officer may uphold the
previous decision of the head of the purchasing agency or
reopen the protest as deemed appropriate.
 
(d)	 A decision under subsection (c) shall be final
and conclusive.
 
. . . .
 
§103F-504 Exclusivity of remedies.  The procedures
and remedies provided for in this part, and the rules
adopted by the policy board, shall be the exclusive means
available for persons aggrieved in connection with the award
of a contract to resolve their concerns.
 
8
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"It is well-settled that the right to appeal is purely 
statutory and exists only when given by some constitutional or 
statutory provision." Burke v. County of Maui, 95 Hawai' i 288, 
289, 22 P.3d 84, 85 (2001). "When construing a statute, our foremost obligation is to ascertain and give effect to the 
intention of the legislature, which is to be obtained primarily 
from the language contained in the statute itself." Bhakta v. 
County of Maui, 109 Hawai' i 198, 208, 124 P.3d 943, 953 (2005) 
(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). 
HRS §§ 103F-501 and 103F-502 provide the steps for an
 
aggrieved party to protest a contract award. The party submits a
 
letter of protest to the head of the purchasing agency, who can
 
respond in one of five ways. The aggrieved party then has the
 
option to submit a request for reconsideration to the chief
 
procurement officer, who can either confirm the previous decision
 
or reopen the protest. According to HRS § 103F-504, this protest
 
procedure "shall be the exclusive means available for persons
 
aggrieved in connection with the award of a contract to resolve
 
their concerns." (Emphasis added.) Thus, by its terms, Chapter
 
103F does not allow for judicial review.
 
ANK acknowledges that, under Chapter 103F, the Hawai' i 
Legislature (Legislature) clearly intended for DOE to be the 
final arbiter in contract award protests. However, ANK claims 
that giving DOE the power to be the final arbiter violates the 
separation of powers doctrine and, therefore, Chapter 103F is 
unconstitutional. We disagree. 
The separation of powers doctrine preserves the checks 
and balances of our system of government, where "sovereign power 
is divided and allocated among three co-equal branches." Hawaii 
Insurers Council v. Lingle, 120 Hawai' i 51, 69, 201 P.3d 564, 582 
(2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). "The 
doctrine provides that a department may not exercise powers not 
so constitutionally granted, which from their essential nature, 
do not fall within its division of governmental functions, unless 
9
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
such powers are properly incidental to the performance by it of
 
its own appropriate functions." Id. at 70, 201 P.3d at 583
 
(internal quotation marks, citation, and ellipsis omitted;
 emphasis added). 
The right to appeal is purely statutory and the Hawai' i 
Constitution vests the Legislature with legislative power, which 
"is defined as the power to enact laws and to declare what the 
law shall be. Under this grant of authority, the [L]egislature 
has the power to establish the subject matter jurisdiction of our 
state court system." Sherman v. Sawyer, 63 Haw. 55, 57, 621 P.2d 
346, 348 (1980) (citation omitted); see Haw. Const. art. VI, § 1 ("The judicial power of the State shall be vested in one supreme 
court [and] one intermediate appellate court . . . . The several 
courts shall have original and appellate jurisdiction as provided 
by law . . . .") (Emphasis added.) 
The Legislature, in enacting Chapter 103F, determined
 
that the judiciary had no power to review procurement grievance
 
procedures under Chapter 103F. Our courts have "consistently
 
held that every enactment of the [L]egislature is presumptively
 
constitutional, and a party challenging the statute has the
 
burden of showing unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt.
 
The infraction should be plain, clear, manifest, and
 
unmistakable." Blair v. Cayetano, 73 Haw. 536, 542, 836 P.2d
 
1066, 1069 (1992) (internal quotation marks, citation, brackets,
 and ellipses omitted). ANK has not met its burden of showing
 
unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt.
 
ANK also argues that the statute is unconstitutional
 
because "[t]he administrative agency is not empowered to pass on
 
the validity of the statute; nor is it qualified to adjudicate
 
the propriety of its own action." HOH Corp. v. Motor Vehicle
 
Indus. Licensing Bd. (HOH), 69 Haw 135, 143, 736 P.2d 1271, 1276
 (1987). In HOH, the issue was not the propriety of procedural
 
actions, but, rather, the constitutionality of a statute, and
 
"[a]lthough an administrative agency may always determine
 
10
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
questions about its own jurisdiction it generally lacks power to
 
pass upon constitutionality of a statute." Id. at 141, 736 P.2d
 
at 1275 (internal quotation marks, citation, and brackets in
 original omitted). In other words, an administrative agency does
 
not have the authority to decide if its actions are
 
constitutional; but Chapter 103F does give an administrative
 
agency the authority to decide if its actions are otherwise
 
proper. In suggesting that an administrative agency does not
 
have the authority to review its own administrative actions, ANK
 
misstates the holding in HOH.
 
B.	 THE CIRCUIT COURT DOES NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO
 
REVIEW DOE'S DECISION AND UNDERLYING ACTIONS.
 
Assuming arguendo that Chapter 103F is constitutional,
 
ANK argues that either HRS § 632-1 (1993) (Declaratory Judgments)
 
or HRS § 603-21.9(6) gives the circuit court the power and
 
obligation "to determine whether the DOE had exceeded its
 
authority, misconstrued or violated a statute or rule, [or]
 
deprived ANK of procedural rights."
 
Although HRS § 632-1 "generally endorses declaratory 
relief in civil cases, it nonetheless disallows such relief where 
a statute provides a special form of remedy for a specific type 
of case." Travelers Ins. Co. v. Hawaii Roofing, Inc., 64 Haw. 
380, 386, 641 P.2d 1333, 1337 (1982) (internal quotation marks, ellipsis, brackets, and footnote omitted). "[W]here such a 
statutory remedy exists, declaratory judgment does not lie." 
Punohu v. Sunn, 66 Hawai' i 485, 486, 666 P.2d 1133, 1134 (1983). 
Chapter 103F provides for just such a "statutory
 
remedy" for a "specific type of case"; namely, the protest
 
process under HRS §§ 103F-501 through 103F-504. HRS § 103F-504
 
limits the protester to an administrative process as the
 
"exclusive means" to resolve contract disputes. Therefore,
 
declaratory relief under HRS § 632-1 is unavailable because that
 
section specifically mandates that the statutory remedy provided
 
11
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
in Chapter 103F must be followed. See Travelers Ins., 64 Haw. at
 
386-87, 641 P.2d at 1337-38.
 
In the alternative, ANK claims that the circuit court
 
had jurisdiction to review the legality of DOE's conduct "in the
 
context of the court's general authority as described in HRS
 
§ 603-21.9(6)." We disagree.
 
HRS § 603-21.9(6) provides that the circuit court has 
the power "[t]o make and award such judgments, decrees, orders, 
and mandates . . . and take such other steps as may be necessary 
to carry into full effect the powers which are or shall be given 
to them by law." Contrary to ANK's contention, HRS § 603-21.9(6) 
does not give the circuit court jurisdiction to rule on a claim 
when the statute limits review exclusively to an administrative 
body. As clarified in Kaina v. Gellman, 119 Hawai' i 324, 197 
P.3d 776 (App. 2008), "HRS § 603-21.9(1) & (6) is a legislative restatement of the inherent powers doctrine," Kaina, 119 Hawai' i 
at 331, 197 P.3d at 783, which gives the courts "the inherent power and authority to control the litigation process before them 
and to curb abuses and promote fair process including, for 
example, the power to impose sanctions for abusive litigation 
practices." Id. at 330, 197 P.3d at 782 (internal quotation 
marks and citation omitted). 
Because the Legislature did not give the circuit court
 
the power or jurisdiction to review administrative appeals under
 Chapter 103F, the court did not err when it determined it did not
 
have the authority to review DOE's decision and underlying
 
actions.
 
C.	 THE CIRCUIT COURT DID NOT ERR IN DISMISSING ANK'S
 
TORT CLAIM FOR NEGLIGENCE.
 
ANK contends that DOE violated a legal duty to follow
 
Chapter 103F and its administrative rules and therefore ANK had a
 
viable tort claim for negligence.
 
The circuit court held that "[t]here is no private
 
right of action under Chapter 103F, no tort duty is imposed by
 
12
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Chapter 103F, [and] therefore there is no cause of action for
 
damages under Chapter 662."
 
First, we note that the circuit court based its 
analysis on a private right of action inquiry, not a standing 
inquiry. "[T]he standing inquiry focuses on whether a particular 
private party is an appropriate plaintiff," while "[t]he private 
right of action inquiry focuses on the question of whether any 
private party can sue to enforce a statute." Cnty. of Hawai' i v. 
Ala Loop Homeowners, 123 Hawai' i 391, 406 n.20, 235 P.3d 1103, 
1118 n.20 (2010) (emphases in original). 
In determining whether a statute provides for a private 
cause of action, the Hawai' i Supreme Court has applied the 
following criteria: 
First, is the plaintiff "one of the class for whose especial
benefit the statute was enacted" -- that is, does the
statute create a right in favor of the plaintiff? Second,
is there any indication of legislative intent, explicit or
implicit, either to create such a remedy or to deny one?
Third, is it consistent with the underlying purposes of the
legislative scheme to imply such a remedy for the plaintiff?
 
Id. at 407, 235 P.3d at 1119 (ellipses and brackets omitted) 
(quoting Pono v. Molokai Ranch, Ltd., 119 Hawai' i 164, 185, 194 
P.3d 1126, 1147 (App. 2008)). Of the above criteria, the "legislative intent appears to be the determinative factor."

(2007). See also Whitey's Boat Cruises, Inc. v. Napali-Kauai

To determine legislative intent, we must first look to 
the language of the statute. Morgan v. Planning Dep't, Cnty. of 
Kauai, 104 Hawai' i 173, 185, 86 P.3d 982, 994 (2004). 
"[L]egislative enactments are presumptively valid and should be interpreted in such a manner as to give them effect." Id. 
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
Although a departure from a literal construction of a
statute is justified when such construction would produce an
absurd result and is clearly inconsistent with the purposes
and policies of the act, this court may not reject generally

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
unambiguous language if construction can be legitimately
found which will give force to and preserve all the words of
the statute.
 
Id. (ellipsis omitted) (quoting Sato v. Tawata, 79 Hawai' i 14, 
23, 897 P.2d 941, 950 (1995) (Ramil, J., dissenting)). 
Chapter 103F provides clear language indicating that
 
the protest and reconsideration process is "final and
 
conclusive." HRS § 103F-502(d). The chapter further states that
 
"[t]he procedures and remedies provided for in this part, and the
 
rules adopted by the policy board, shall be the exclusive means
 
available for persons aggrieved in connection with the award of a
 
contract to resolve their concerns." HRS § 103F-504. The
 
legislative history supports the limitations on court challenges
 
where Chapter 103F intended a "simpler, standardized process" for
 
the procurement of health and human services. S. Stand. Comm.
 
Rep. No. 1465, in 1997 Senate Journal, at 1447-48.
 
ANK argued before the circuit court that Tseu v. Jeyte, 
88 Hawai' i 85, 962 P.2d 344 (1998), controlled and that when an 
administrative agency fails to follow the applicable rules and statutes, it can be sued in tort. The circuit court correctly 
distinguished Jeyte, noting that the negligence issue there 
involved a substantive right, not a procedural defect as alleged 
in the instant case. Although ANK argued that DOE substantively 
violated Chapter 103F when the evaluator allegedly did not follow 
the criteria listed in the RFP, this protest was made in 
accordance with Chapter 103F, which mandates that the 
reconsideration decision of the agency is final. 
The statutory language clearly indicates the intent of
 
the Legislature to deny a private right of action. Therefore,
 
there is no action in tort. Because there is no private right of
 
action under Chapter 103F, there is also no cause of action for
 
damages under HRS Chapter 662.

D.	 ANK'S CLAIMS FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
 
CONCERNING THE VALIDITY OF CHAPTER 103F WERE NOT
 TREATED AS MOOT.
 
ANK contends that "[a]ssuming the court based its 
decision in whole or in part on mootness, the court clearly 
erred." ANK asserts that its claims for declaratory and 
injunctive relief are not moot because the issue of the 
constitutionality of Chapter 103F qualifies for an exception to 
the mootness rule, being "capable of repetition, yet evading 
review." AKN cites to Kaho' ohanohano v. State, 114 Hawai' i 302, 
332-33, 162 P.3d 696, 726-27 (2007) (issue was not moot even though Act fully implemented), to argue that "[w]hether or not 
the underlying DOE contract has concluded ha[s] no bearing on 
whether this court can grant the relief requested." 
The circuit court, in its oral indication as to how it
 
would rule, agreed with ANK that the issue of constitutionality
 
was not moot, stating that "[c[laims for declaratory relief
 
regarding, one, the constitutionality of Chapter 103F and, number
 
two, the Defendant's alleged failure to comply with the
 
applicable procedural law are not moot since the alleged
 
violations are capable of repetition." The circuit court orally
 
considered the two issues and voiced its inclination as to how it
 
would rule on the issues. Contrary to ANK's contention, the
 
circuit court properly considered ANK's claims for declaratory
 
and injunctive relief and did not base its ruling on mootness. 
E.	 JUDICIAL REVIEW UNDER HRS CHAPTER 91 (CHAPTER 91)
IS PRECLUDED BY HRS § 103F-504.
 
ANK contends the circuit court erred in its March 20,
 
2006 Order when the court dismissed Count I of the First Amended
 
Complaint, finding "that judicial review under [HRS] Chapter 91
 
is precluded by [HRS] § 103F-504." ANK claims the circuit court
 
mistakenly thought ANK was arguing for judicial review under
 
Chapter 91, which had been unsuccessfully invoked by ANK in Civil
 
15
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
No. 05-1-1659.4 Instead, ANK claims that its argument, which it 
incorporated into Count I of its Second Amended Complaint,5 was 
that HRS § 91-14 (1993 & Supp. 2010) provides "guidelines that 
the court could adopt if it concluded that it had a 
jurisdictional basis for review of the DOE actions" under the 
Hawai'i Constitution and HRS § 603-21.9(6). 
Because ANK restated in Count I of its Second Amended
 
Complaint the same Chapter 91 argument that it had made in Count
 
I of its First Amended Complaint, ANK had its day in court on
 
this argument. There was no error.

 In a separate circuit court action, Civil No. 05-1-1659, the
Honorable Eden Elizabeth Hifo dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction.
ANK appealed to the Hawai' i Supreme Court. In an unpublished summary
disposition order, the Hawai' i Supreme Court held that "the circuit court did
not err in ruling that it lacked HRS chapter 91 jurisdiction in the instantcase" because the protest process "did not constitute a 'hearing' within themeaning of HRS chapter 91." Alaka'i Na Keiki, Inc. v. Hamamoto, No. 27559
(Haw. Jan. 22, 2007) (SDO), 113 Hawai' i 210, 150 P.3d 1281 (2007).

 In ¶ 50 of the First Amended Complaint and ¶ 54 of the Second Amended
Complaint, ANK made the same argument: "The Court may utilize the criteria
for judicial review s [sic] in HRS § 91-14 where the court has a separate
jurisdictional basis to review agency action."
