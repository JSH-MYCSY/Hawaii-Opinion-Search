STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
DAVID MAXWELL, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1P10808566)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant David Maxwell (Maxwell) appeals 
from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order (Judgment) 
filed on March 4, 2009 in the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (district court).
1 
Maxwell was convicted of Attempted Criminal Property 
Damage in the Fourth Degree, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 708-823 (Supp. 2009). The Judgment reflects a violation of HRS ยง 708-823, but the court's oral explanation of its ruling at the close of trial clarifies that the court found Maxwell guilty of attempt to commit the crime, as defined in HRS ยง 705-500 (1993). The court further explained that "attempted criminal property [damage] in the fourth degree is an included offense of criminal property [damage] in the fourth degree." 
On appeal, Maxwell contends that there was insufficient 
evidence to convict him of Attempted Criminal Property Damage in the Fourth Degree. Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai
'i contends 
there was substantial evidence to convict Maxwell of Attempted

Criminal Property Damage in the Fourth Degree. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Maxwell's point of error as follows:
 
The complaining witness stated that Maxwell jumped onto 
the hood of the car she was driving and began pulling at the windshield wiper with all of his might. She believed that Maxwell was going to break it off and use it to damage the windshield. The district court did not believe that Maxwell was holding on to the windshield wiper because the vehicle was moving forward while he was on the hood. "It is well-settled that an appellate court will not pass upon issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence; this is the province of the trier of fact." State v. Mattiello, 90 
Hawai
'i 255, 259, 978 P.2d 693, 697 (1999) (internal quotation 
marks and brackets omitted). 
"[G]iven the difficulty of proving the requisite state 
of mind by direct evidence in criminal cases, we have consistently held that proof by circumstantial evidence and reasonable inferences arising from circumstances surrounding the defendant's conduct is sufficient[.]" State v. Stocker, 90 
Hawai
'i 85, 92, 976 P.2d 399, 406 (1999) (internal quotation 
marks, brackets, and ellipses omitted). "Thus, the mind of an alleged offender may be read from his acts, conduct and inferences fairly drawn from all the circumstances." Id. The 
district court concluded that Maxwell deliberately attempted to damage the windshield wipers when he jumped onto the hood of the

car and pulled at them with all of his might. The owner of the
 
vehicle testified that he did not give permission to Maxwell to
 damage the vehicle. The windshield wipers were not damaged,
 therefore, Maxwell may not be convicted of Criminal Property
 Damage in the Fourth Degree. However, Maxwell's actions
 constituted intentional conduct which constitute a substantial
 step in a course of conduct intended to culminate in the damage
 of the windshield wipers.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Maxwell's conviction for
 
Attempted Criminal Property Damage in the Fourth Degree and the
 March 4, 2009 Judgment are affirmed.
