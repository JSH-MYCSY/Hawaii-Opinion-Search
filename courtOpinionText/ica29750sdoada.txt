county ordinance or by official signs placed by the
director of transportation on highways under the

Judgment was filed on March 10, 2009,  in the District Court of
the First Circuit (District Court).3
 
Reinke was charged with driving a motor vehicle in 
excess of the maximum speed limit by traveling 57 miles per hour 
in a 35 mile-per-hour zone. Reinke did not challenge the evidence presented by Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai
'i (State) 
to prove the charge at trial. Instead, he moved "for a dismissal" of the charge on the basis that "the federal government has mandated that federally-funded streets and highways in this country must have traffic engineering studies conducted on them before any officer of the law can conduct a speed enforcement on it." In support of this claim, Reinke introduced a letter from the Director of the State Department of Transportation stating that the State had not conducted any speed surveys in the area where Reinke was cited and portions of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) published by the United States Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration. 
The District Court treated Reinke's arguments as a
 
motion for judgment of acquittal and denied the motion. The
 District Court found that the State had satisfied its burden of
 proof and that Reinke had committed the speeding infraction as
 charged. The District Court imposed fines, fees, and assessments
 against Reinke in the total amount of $167.
 
Reinke's arguments on appeal are difficult to follow. 
It appears that he is arguing that pursuant to federal laws, which he claims include the MUTCD and preempt Hawai
'i's laws, the 
State's failure to conduct an engineering study in the area where he was cited precludes the State from enforcing the posted speed limit. Reinke cites no persuasive authority to support his arguments, and we conclude that his arguments are without merit.

9, 2009, but the Judgment is file-stamped March 10, 2009.
