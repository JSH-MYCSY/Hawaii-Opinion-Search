v.
BRIAN T. GRIMAN, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
HONOLULU DIVISION
(Case No. 1DTA-08-10419)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard, and Ginoza, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Brian T. Griman (Griman) appeals
from the Judgment filed on March 11, 2009,1 in the District Court
of the First Circuit (district court).2
Griman was convicted of operating a vehicle under the
influence of an intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii
Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 291E-61(a)(1) and (b)(1) (Supp. 2008). 
On appeal, Griman argues that the district court erred
by 1) denying his motion to dismiss the OVUII charge because it
failed to state an essential element of the offense, namely, that
Griman operated or assumed actual physical control of a vehicle
upon a public way, street, road, or highway;3 and 2) imposing a
sentence that included a ninety-day license suspension when
Griman's driver's license had been administratively revoked and
Griman's challenge to the administrative revocation was still
pending.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties, we resolve Griman's arguments on appeal
follows:
1. "[T]he operation [or the assumption of actual
physical control] of a vehicle on a public way, street, road, or
highway is an attendant circumstance of the offense of OVUII, and
is therefore an element of the offense."  State v. Wheeler, 121
Hawai#i 383, 393, 219 P.3d 1170, 1180 (2009).  The OVUII charge
brought against Griman was insufficient because it failed to
allege that Griman operated or assumed actual physical control of
a vehicle upon a public way, street, road, or highway.  Id.   
2. Because we conclude that Griman's OVUII charge was
insufficient, we need not address his claim that the district
court erred in imposing a sentence that included a ninety-day
license suspension. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the district court's Judgment
filed on March 11, 2009, is vacated, and this case is remanded to
the district court with instructions to dismiss the OVUII charge
without prejudice.
