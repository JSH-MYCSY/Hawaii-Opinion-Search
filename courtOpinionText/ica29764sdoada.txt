STATE OF HAWAI» I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
BETHANN AHSING, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(HPD Traffic No. 1DTA-08-09117)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Bethann Ahsing (Ahsing) appeals the
 
Judgment, entered on March 3, 2009, in the District Court of the
 
First Circuit, Honolulu Division (district court).1
 
Ahsing was convicted of Operating a Vehicle Under the
 
Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii
 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a) and (b) (Supp. 2009) and
 
Excessive Speeding, in violation of HRS § 291C-105 (Supp. 2009).
 
On appeal, Ahsing contends (1) that although she did
 
not object, the written complaint and oral charge for OVUII
 
failed to state an essential element of the offense, i.e., that
 
Ahsing operated or assumed actual physical control of a vehicle
 
upon a public way, street, road, or highway, and (2) the district
 
court erred by admitting a speed check card over her objection
 
because it lacked proper foundation and was not authenticated as
 
a business record and therefore there was insufficient evidence
 
to convict her of Excessive Speeding.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs2
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
1
 The Honorable William Cardwell presided.

 In compliance with this court's order, entered on March 23, 2010, on
March 25, 2010, Ahsing, and on April 12, 2010, the State submitted
supplemental briefs addressing whether the OVUII charge in this case was
sufficient and whether the "Motta/Wells" rule of liberal construction applied
in this case. These supplemental briefs were also carefully considered in
reaching our decision.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Ahsing's points of error as follows:
 
(1) "[T]he operation of a vehicle on a public way, 
street, road, or highway is an attendant circumstance of the 
offense of OVUII, and is therefore an element of the offense." 
State v. Wheeler , 121 Hawai» i 383, 393, 219 P.3d 1170, 1180 
(2009). The failure to allege that Ahsing was driving a vehicle 
upon a public way, street, road, or highway at the time of the 
offense rendered the charge deficient. Id. 
(2) The State failed to establish
 
(1) how and when the speed check was performed, including
whether it was performed in the manner specified by the
manufacturer of the equipment used to perform the check, and
(2) the identity and qualifications of the person performing
the check, including whether that person had whatever
training the manufacturer recommends in order to competently
perform it.
 
State v. Fitzwater , No. 28584, 2010 WL 717551, at *23 (Haw.
 
Mar. 3, 2010). Therefore, there was insufficient foundation to
 
admit the speed check card into evidence. Without admission of
 
the speed check card into evidence, there was insufficient
 
evidence to convict Ahsing of Excessive Speeding.
 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the Judgment, entered on
 
March 3, 2009, in the District Court of the First Circuit,
 Honolulu Division is vacated in part and reversed in part. The
 
conviction and sentence for the offense of Excessive Speeding is
 
hereby reversed. The remainder of the case is remanded to the
 
district court with instructions to dismiss the OVUII charge
 
without prejudice.
