NO. 29771
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
RICHARD B. RAPOZO, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P. NO. 08-1-0003; CRIMINAL NO. 51915)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Richard B. Rapozo (Rapozo) appeals
 
the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying
 
Petition for Post-Conviction Relief Without a Hearing, filed on
 
March 31, 2009 (Order Denying Post-Conviction Relief) in the
 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court).1
 
On May 16, 1979, Rapozo was found guilty of Murder, in
 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 707-701 (1976). 
Rapozo was sentenced to a term of life imprisonment with the
 
possibility of parole. On October 15, 1980, in Appeal No. 7412,
 
this court affirmed Rapozo's conviction. State v. Rapozo, 1 Haw.
 
App. 255, 617 P.2d 1235 (1980).
 
On January 24, 2008, Rapozo filed a Petition to Vacate, 
Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner from 
Custody (Petition) (S.P.P. No. 08-1-0003), pursuant to Hawai 'i 
Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40. Rapozo claimed, inter 
alia, that his maximum term of imprisonment (or parole) should 
have been 20 years and that he is being held beyond the maximum 
expiration date of his sentence. On appeal, Rapozo raises 
essentially the same arguments, as well as additional contentions 
not raised in the Petition. Issues not raised by Rapozo in the

Petition will not be reviewed on this appeal. See Hawai 'i Rules 
of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(4).2 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Rapozo's points of error as follows:
 
In 1979, Rapozo was properly sentenced in accordance
 
with HRS ยง 706-606(b) (1976) to life with possibility of parole. 
Rapozo is not being held beyond the expiration of his maximum
 
sentence. Rapozo's arguments to the contrary are wholly without
 
merit.
 
Accordingly, the Circuit Court's March 31, 2009 Order
 
Denying Petition for Post-Conviction Relief is affirmed.

 In addition, with respect to Rapozo's contentions regarding the trial
judge's competency, "Rule 40 proceedings shall not be available and relief thereunder
shall not be granted where the issues sought to be raised have been previously ruled
upon or were waived." HRPP Rule 40(a)(3).
