APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 07-1-0097K)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant George Robert Toth (Toth) appeals 
from the Amended Final Judgment (Judgment) filed on March 17, 
2009 in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit (circuit court).1 
The circuit court entered judgment in favor of Defendants-Appellees Donald S. Rullo (Rullo); Red Time Realty, LLC (Red Time); Michael J. Swerdlow (Swerdlow); and Ho
'omau I Mua LLC 
(Ho'omau I Mua) (collectively, Defendants) and against Toth 
pursuant to Defendants' June 19, 2007 "Motion to Dismiss [Toth's] Complaint or, in the Alternative, for Summary Judgment" (Defendants' MSJ). The circuit court dismissed all of Toth's

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
claims against Defendant Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB, a Federal
 
Savings Bank (Lehman Brothers).
 
On appeal, Toth argues that the circuit court
 (1) in granting Defendants' MSJ
 (a) erred because there was a genuine issue of
 
material fact as to whether the January 20, 2007 Cancellation of
 Agreement of Sale (Cancellation Agreement) he entered into with
 Rullo is voidable on the ground of fraudulent inducement;
 
(b) erred as a matter of law because the
 
Cancellation Agreement is voidable on the ground that Rullo
 breached his fiduciary duty to disclose material facts to Toth
 regarding the purchase transaction; and
 
(c) erred as a matter of law because the
 
Cancellation Agreement is void on the ground that it violates
 Hawaii County Code (HCC) Section 23-76; and
 
(2) erred in concluding that the terms of the
 
Cancellation Agreement precluded Toth from making any of his 
claims in the Complaint against any of the Defendants.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Toth's
 points of error as follows:
 
(1) The circuit court did not err by granting
 
Defendants' MSJ because Toth did not meet his burden of showing
 that there was a genuine issue of material fact regarding his
 claims against Defendants.
 
(a) Toth has cited to no authority to support the
 
notion that a broker's commission of fraud or breach of fiduciary
 duty in inducing a purchaser to sign an Agreement of Sale
 automatically voids a subsequent Cancellation Agreement.
 
(b) Regardless of whether Toth's entering into
 
the Cancellation Agreement was "knowing," Toth has not argued it
 was Defendants' burden to inform him of any claims he may have
 against them at the time he signed it. In the Cancellation

Agreement, Toth agreed to "release and forever discharge[]
 
[Rullo] . . . from and on account of any and all claims, causes
 of action, liabilities, losses or damages of whatever name or
 nature, arising out of or related in any manner to the subjects
 described in this Agreement and the Agreement of Sale attached
 hereto." There is no evidence in the record on appeal that
 "claims" did not include Toth's allegations that Defendants
 committed fraud or breach of fiduciary duty in inducing him to
 sign the Agreement of Sale or DROA.
 
(c) Toth has failed to adequately argue that 
there was a genuine issue of material fact with regard to his claim that Rullo fraudulently induced him to sign the Cancellation Agreement by misrepresenting that (1) Toth had to vacate the Property, (2) the purchase transaction had terminated, and (3) Toth had to accept $63,595.64 in return for cancelling the purchase transaction. In his opposition to Defendants' MSJ, Toth failed to address that claim at all. See Laeroc Waikiki 
Parkside, LLC v. K.S.K. (Oahu) Ltd. P'ship, 115 Hawai
'i 201, 216, 
166 P.3d 961, 976 (2007) (setting forth the elements of fraudulent inducement); Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 
56(e) ("[T]he adverse party's response [to a motion for summary judgment], by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. If the adverse party does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against the adverse party."). 
(d) Although Toth argued below and argues on 
appeal that the Agreement of Sale and DROA were invalid because they were in violation of Hawai
'i County Code Section 23-76, he 
has not explained how in his estimation the Agreement of Sale and DROA's alleged invalidity on that basis rendered the Cancellation Agreement void. Pursuant to the terms of the Cancellation Agreement, Toth waived the right to pursue against Defendants any claims â€“- including that the Cancellation Agreement was void

because the Agreement of Sale and DROA failed to comply with
 
Section 23-76. 
(2) The circuit court did not err in concluding that 
Toth waived all of his claims against all of the Defendants. Toth failed below to distinguish among Rullo, Swerdlow, Red Time, and Ho
'omau I Mua or demonstrate which of his claims were 
unrelated to the Agreement of Sale or Cancellation Agreement. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Amended Final Judgment
 
filed on March 17, 2009 in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit
 is affirmed.
