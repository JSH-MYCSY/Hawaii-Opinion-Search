OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
JUSTIN M. WALTHALL, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
 
THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY OF THE STATE

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
NORTH AND SOUTH HILO DIVISION
 
(CIVIL NO. 3RC07-1-0456)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
In a civil case arising out of an alleged personal
 
injury, Plaintiff-Appellant pro se Justin M. Walthall (Walthall)
 
appeals from the Decision and Judgment filed on April 6, 2009 in
 
the District Court of the Third Circuit, North and South Hilo
 
Division (district court).1 The district court entered judgment
 
in favor of Defendant-Appellee State of Hawaii Department of
 Safety (State) and against Walthall.
 
On appeal, Walthall appears to argue that the district
 
court erred in finding that he presented insufficient evidence to
 
carry his burden of proof.

On August 13, 2007, Walthall filed a complaint in 
district court, alleging that he had been injured on December 13, 
2005 while he was incarcerated at the Hawai 'i Community 
Correctional Center in Hilo, Hawaii. He alleged that on December 13, he was put on work detail over his objection that 
prior injuries and a medical note precluded him from working and 
that while he was moving equipment across a wooden walkway, the 
walkway collapsed. As a result, he received injuries to his left 
knee and lower back/shoulder that persisted for nine months. He 
claimed damages in the amount of $20,000, due to his inability to 
work, pay bills, or keep a place to live. 
Trial was held on February 27, 2009. On April 6, 2009,
 
the district court filed the Decision and Judgment in favor of
 
the State and against Walthall, finding that Walthall had not met
 
the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence that the
 
injuries he claimed were caused by the negligence of the State. 
On April 17, 2009, Walthall filed a timely notice of appeal.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude that 
Walthall's appeal is without merit.
 
In his opening brief, Walthall does not provide a 
concise statement of the case, standards of review, or points of 
error, as required by Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
Rule 28(b).2 He also does not provide a record of the 
proceedings below upon which this court can review any 
allegations of error. Although Walthall filed on May 5, 2009 a 
2
 The State's answering brief fails to comply with HRAP Rule 28(b)(3)
by failing to include in the statement of the case, "record references
supporting each statement of fact or mention of court . . . proceedings."
(Emphasis added.) The State's counsel is warned that future non-compliance
with HRAP 28(b)(3) may result in sanctions against them.

request for the February 27, 2009 trial transcript (the
 
Transcript), his motion to waive payment of the transcript fee
 
was denied by this court on June 2, 2009. Walthall failed to
 
provide this court with the Transcript.
 
As the appellant, Walthall has a duty to include a 
relevant transcript as part of the record on appeal. Lepere v. 
UPW, 77 Hawai 'i 471, 474, 887 P.2d 1029, 1032 (1995). Without 
the Transcript, we have no basis upon which to review the 
decision of the district court, which we therefore leave 
undisturbed. Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai 'i 225, 231, 
909 P.2d 553, 559 (1995). 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Decision and Judgment
 
filed on April 6, 2009 in the District Court of the Third
 Circuit, North and South Hilo Division, is affirmed.
