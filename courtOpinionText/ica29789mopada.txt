APPEAL FROM THE LABOR & INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
(CASE NO. AB 2006-163(H)(1-03-00489))
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Helen L. Gabriel ("Gabriel") 
appeals from the March 24, 2009 Decision and Order entered by the 
Hawai
'i Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board ("LIRAB"). 
The order, in relevant part, affirmed the Director of the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations' ("Director") September 14, 2006 Decision and Order that (1) denied Gabriel additional temporary total disability ("TTD") benefits relating to a May 22, 2003 work injury ("2003 Injury") beyond January 9, 2006; and (2) determined that Gabriel's former employer, the County of Hawai' i, Department of Parks & Recreation ("Employer"), 
was entitled to credit the TTD payments it paid to Gabriel between January 10 and March 5, 2006, against a prospective award of permanent partial disability benefits. 
For the reasons discussed below, we vacate the LIRAB's
 
March 24, 2009 Decision and Order and remand for further
 proceedings.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
I. POINTS OF ERROR
 
On appeal, Gabriel contends that the LIRAB erred by (1)
 
declining to admit into evidence, due to untimely filings, both
 
the testimony of physician Scott McCaffrey ("Dr. McCaffrey") and
 his medical report dated September 26, 2007 ("Dr. McCaffrey's
 2007 Report"); (2) finding that Dr. McCaffrey, in an earlier
 report ("Dr. McCaffrey's 2006 Report"), had not attributed her
 disability to the 2003 Injury; and (3) crediting Employer with
 three months of TTD payments made to Gabriel between January 10
 and March 6, 2006, against Employer's liability for prospective
 benefits.
 
II. BACKGROUND
 
On May 22, 2003, Gabriel, while working for Employer as
 
a park caretaker, sustained injuries to her lower back and left
 
leg as a result of lifting and using a pressure washer. Employer
 accepted liability for those injuries.
 
Thereafter, Gabriel received treatment and diagnoses
 
from several physicians regarding pain and other symptoms
 manifesting in her back and leg. In addition to the specific
 injury, Gabriel was diagnosed with various conditions unrelated
 to the injury. The physicians eventually deemed Gabriel fit for
 light duty work.
 
On October 24, 2005, at Employer's request, the
 
Director ordered Gabriel to attend a psychological evaluation
 with psychologist Joseph Rogers ("Dr. Rogers"). Dr. Rogers met
 with Gabriel, compiled a comprehensive report of Gabriel's prior
 medical treatment and diagnoses, and clinically diagnosed her
 with Pain Disorder Associated with Psychological Factors. Dr.
 Rogers opined that while Gabriel suffered psychological factors
 that "represent[ed] issues of poor motivation and disincentives
 to her recovery and return to work," she did not have any
 psychiatric/psychological work limitations or restrictions.
 
After a hearing on November 10, 2005 to address
 
treatment issues, the Director issued the January 31, 2006
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
1
Decision and Order  providing for medical and TTD benefits
covering, for the most part, the period from May 31, 2003,
 
through November 10, 2005. The January 31, 2006 Decision and
 Order also provided that further TTD benefits were to be made
 "contingent upon proper certification of disability." 
On February 21, 2006, Employer notified Gabriel that it 
intended to terminate TTD benefits effective March 7, 2006, and
 would deem any TTD payments made after January 10, 2006, to be a
 credit against any future compensation. On March 13, 2006,
 Gabriel moved to remand her case to the Director for an emergency
 hearing regarding the termination of TTD benefits, arguing that
 Employer had not provided medical evidence of her ability to
 return to work. Employer stipulated, along with Gabriel, to the
 temporary remand, which was granted by the LIRAB on April 18,
 2006.
 
On July 25, 2006, the Director held a hearing ("July
 
2006 Hearing") to address the termination of TTD benefits. While
 Gabriel cited various factors, including conflicts with coÂ­workers and chronic pain stemming from the 2003 Injury, Employer
 cited reports from three different physicians and Dr. Rogers,
 each attesting to Gabriel's ability to return to work.
 
On August 10, 2006, before the Director rendered a
 
decision related to the July 2006 Hearing, Gabriel visited Dr.
 McCaffrey. Based on his examination, Dr. McCaffrey reported:
 
Ms. Gabriella [sic] has suffered a significant and severe
lumbosacral and thoracic injury on the above date. Her exam
 is consistent with compression fracture and/or disc
derangement of the mid-thoracic region. Likewise, she
appears to have suffered a significant structural injury to
the lumbar region with chronic, persistent pain, muscle
spasm, and severe and dramatic range of motion loss. 
Dr. McCaffrey made specific recommendations for further
 
evaluation and care. He declared Gabriel's work status as "Off
 duty effective 3/15/06." Gabriel sought to change her primary
 care physician to Dr. McCaffrey, but Employer denied this request
 on multiple grounds. Gabriel did not pursue relief from
 Employer's denial. 
1/
 A clerical error in the January 31, 2006 Decision and Order was
corrected by an amended decision and order that was issued on February 10,
2006.
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On September 14, 2006, the Director issued a Decision
 
and Order regarding the July 2006 Hearing. The Director found
 
that Employer properly terminated benefits effective March 7,
 2006, and that Employer was entitled to a credit for TTD benefits
 paid to Gabriel between January 10 and March 6, 2006. The
 Director transmitted the case back to the LIRAB for determination
 of all issues on appeal. Gabriel appealed to LIRAB from the
 September 14, 2006 Decision and Order.
 
The LIRAB scheduled an initial conference regarding the
 
appeal for November 16, 2006. In response, both Gabriel and
 Employer submitted their initial conference statements; Gabriel's
 designated witnesses, therein, included Dr. McCaffrey. 
On November 22, 2006, the LIRAB issued a Pretrial Order
 
which identified the issues to be determined as:
 
a. Whether [Gabriel] is entitled to further physical
therapy. 
b. Whether [Gabriel] is entitled to [TTD] benefits after
January 9, 2006, as a result of the work injury of May22, 2003. 
c. Whether Employer is entitled to credit [TTD] benefitspaid from January 10, 2006 to March 6, 2006 againstthe award for permanent partial disability benefits. 
The Pretrial Order also scheduled trial for October 8, 2007, and
 
set August 13, 2007, as the discovery deadline for both live
 witness identification and medical reports submissions.
 
On July 25, 2007, Employer's live witness
 
identification list, which included Dr. McCaffrey, was filed. On
 August 13, 2007, a July 23, 2007 medical report from physician
 Bruce Hector ("Dr. Hector") that was also submitted by Employer,
 was filed. Dr. Hector's report reviewed Gabriel's medical
 records dating from the date of the accident. He discounted Dr.
 McCaffrey's report and recommendations for various reasons,
 including inconsistencies with, and the lack of any review of,
 Gabriel's prior medical records. Dr. Hector concluded that
 Gabriel's condition and any further recommended care was not
 attributable to her 2003 Injury.
 
On August 20, 2007, Gabriel's live witness
 
identification list ("Witness List"), in which she identified
 herself, Dr. McCaffrey, and two other witnesses, was filed. Her
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
submission was by letter to the LIRAB, dated August 13, 2007; it
 
does not indicate that a copy was sent to Employer. Gabriel did
 not seek leave to submit her Witness List beyond the discovery
 deadline. 
Gabriel, due to a conflict on counsel's calendar, moved
 
to have the October 8, 2007 hearing date continued to November 2,
 2007. On September 26, 2007, the LIRAB, via its First Amended
 Pretrial Order, reset trial for November 2, 2007, and stated that
 "all discovery deadlines shall remain as previously identified." 
On October 1, 2007, a letter, purporting to be a motion
 
in limine in which Gabriel sought leave to allow a September 26,
 2007 medical report from Dr. McCaffrey to be admitted into
 evidence, was filed. Gabriel argued therein that the report was
 critical to her case because it provided objective evidence of
 her condition. 
The LIRAB scheduled a hearing on Gabriel's motion for
 
October 25, 2007. Employer objected to both the form and
 substance of her letter. The record does not reveal whether the
 LIRAB ever ruled on the motion.
 
On October 30, 2007, Gabriel moved to continue trial on
 
grounds that the results of an orthopedic consultation that she
 had would not be available prior to the scheduled November 2,
 2007 trial date. Gabriel argued that the results may be critical
 to her appeal, and suggested that the LIRAB should order the
 continuance to "prevent manifest injustice." Employer objected
 to the motion as a "ruse" to submit medical reports beyond the
 discovery deadline and as lacking any showing that the evaluation
 and a related diagnostic report could not have been performed
 within the discovery time frame. On November 21, 2007, the LIRAB
 granted the requested continuance, and issued its Second Amended
 Pretrial Order, rescheduling trial to February 1, 2008, and again
 stating that "all discovery deadlines shall remain as previously
 identified." 
On January 28, 2008, Gabriel submitted an amended
 
exhibit list, which included Dr. McCaffrey's 2006 and 2007
 Reports. On January 30, 2008, Employer submitted its motion to
 strike ("January 2008 Motion to Strike"), arguing that Dr.
 
5
    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
McCaffrey's 2007 Report should be excluded as untimely submitted
 
and that Dr. McCaffrey's testimony was irrelevant until such time
 as Gabriel addressed her entitlement to change her physician to
 Dr. McCaffrey.
2
 
On January 30, 2008, after a status conference, the
 
LIRAB issued a Third Amended Pretrial Order. It continued the
 trial to November 10, 2008, and reiterated that "all discovery
 deadlines shall remain as previously identified." It did not
 rule on Employer's January 2008 Motion to Strike.
 
On November 8, 2008, two days before the scheduled
 
trial, Employer again moved to strike ("November 2008 Motion to
 Strike") Gabriel's untimely discovery submissions, including her
 Witness List and Dr. McCaffrey's 2007 Report. Employer asserted
 that it had never received a file-stamped copy of Gabriel's
 Witness List, and that it only learned on November 3, 2008, that
 it had been filed after the discovery deadline.
3 It therefore
 
sought to exclude all witnesses identified therein. Employer
 also sought to exclude all medical records submitted after the
 August 13, 2007 discovery deadline. In addition to untimeliness,
 Employer sought to strike Dr. McCaffrey's reports on grounds that
 he was not authorized to provide services.
 
On November 10, 2008, the LIRAB held a hearing on
 
Employer's November 2008 Motion to Strike. After hearing
 argument, the LIRAB barred Dr. McCaffrey from testifying and
 excluded all medical reports generated and submitted after the
 discovery deadline, despite having acknowledged that surprise was
 not an issue. On November 14, 2008 it issued an order striking
 Dr. McCaffrey's 2007 Report from the record.
 
On March 24, 2009, the LIRAB issued the Decision and
 
Order determining that 1) Gabriel's request for additional
 physical therapy was denied on technical grounds for
 noncompliance with statutory requirements, but that she may still
 
2/
 It appears that Gabriel proceeded as if Dr. McCaffrey was her
treating physician, despite the Employer's denial of her election to change to
Dr. McCaffrey, which Gabriel did not challenge before the LIRAB. See
 
generally H AW. REV. STAT. Â§ 386-21(b); Haw. Admin. R. Â§ 12-15-38.

 Employer does not address whether it had previously received a
non-file-stamped copy.

be entitled to such; 2) Gabriel was not entitled to receive TTD
 
benefits after January 9, 2006, for want of proper medical
 
4
certification;  and 3) that Employer was entitled to credits for
payments issued after that date.
 
Gabriel timely appealed.
 
III. 
STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
Appellate review of a LIRAB decision is governed by
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes Â§ 91-14(g) (1993), which states that: 
Upon review of the record the court may affirm the
decision of the agency or remand the case with instructions
for further proceedings; or it may reverse or modify the
decision and order if the substantial rights of the
petitioners may have been prejudiced because the
administrative findings, conclusions, decisions, or orders
are: 
(1)	 In violation of constitutional or statutory
provisions; or
(2)	 In excess of the statutory authority or
jurisdiction of the agency; or
(3)	 Made upon unlawful procedure; or
(4)	 Affected by other error of law; or
(5)	 Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,
probative, and substantial evidence on the whole
record; or
(6)	 Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized by
abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted
exercise of discretion.
 
HAW. REV. STAT. Â§91-14(g).
 
We have previously stated: 
[Findings of Fact ("FOF")] are reviewable under
the clearly erroneous standard to determine if the
agency decision was clearly erroneous in view of
 
4/
 The LIRAB's Findings of Fact ("FOF") #16 and #17 stated:
 
(16) Although Dr. McCaffrey, an occupational medicine
specialist, examined [Gabriel] on August 16, 2006, and opined in a
report of the same date that [Gabriel] was off[-]duty effective
March 15, 2006, Dr. McCaffrey did not attribute [Gabriel's]
disability from work to her May 22, 2003 work injury. Dr.
 McCaffrey's August 16, 2006 certification retroactively certified
disability to March 15, 2006, but Dr. McCaffrey was not treating
[Gabriel] on March 15, 2006. There is, therefore, no proper
medical certification in the record on appeal that [Gabriel] was
disabled due to her work injury after January 9, 2006. See,
Pacheco v. State of Hawaii, Department of Health, AB 2000-291(H)
(May 16, 2002).
 
(17) The [LIRAB] finds that, based on Dr. Direnfeld's March
3, 2005 and May 12, 2006 reports, Dr. Rogers' January 10, 2006
report, all of which the [LIRAB] credits, and the lack of proper
and contemporaneous medical certification of disability, [Gabriel]
was not entitled to TTD benefits after January 9, 2006.

reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the
whole record. 
[Conclusions of Law ("COL")] are freely
reviewable to determine if the agency's decision was
in violation of constitutional or statutory
provisions, in excess of statutory authority or
jurisdiction of agency, or affected by other error of
law.
 
A COL that presents mixed questions of fact and
law is reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard
because the conclusion is dependent upon the facts and
circumstances of the particular case. When mixed
 questions of law and fact are presented, an appellate
court must give deference to the agency's expertise
and experience in the particular field. The court
 should not substitute its own judgment for that of the
agency.

original omitted) (quoting In re Water Use Permit Applications,
 94 Hawai' i 97, 119, 9 P.3d 409, 431 (2000)). 
An FOF or a mixed determination of law and fact is
 
clearly erroneous when (1) the record lacks substantial
evidence to support the finding or determination, or (2)
despite substantial evidence to support the finding or
determination, the appellate court is left with the definite
and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. We have
 defined "substantial evidence" as credible evidence which is
 of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person
of reasonable caution to support a conclusion.

IV.	 DISCUSSION
 
A.	 The LIRAB's decision to exclude Dr. McCaffrey's
testimony was an abuse of discretion. 
Gabriel contends that, despite her untimely filings,
 
5
the LIRAB abused its discretion  in excluding Dr. McCaffrey's
testimony and 2007 Report. She argues that because (1) Dr.
 
McCaffrey's testimony and report were critical to correlating her
 condition to her 2003 Injury, and (2) as the hearing did not take
 place until November 2008, Employer could not have been
 prejudiced by her untimely filings. It was, therefore, an abuse
 
5/
 Employer's arguments appear premised on the "clearly erroneous"
standard of review. However, where an agency exercises discretion, its
determination is reviewed for abuse of discretion. H AW. REV. STAT. Â§ 91-14(6); cf.
 
Ek v. Boggs, 102 Hawai' i 289, 299, 75 P.3d 1180, 1190 (2003) (discovery sanctions
reviewed for abuse of discretion). 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of discretion "to prevent a fair hearing where there was no
 
possibility of prejudice to the other side." 
Chapter 47 ("LIRAB Rules") of title 12 of Hawai' i's 
Administrative Rules ("HAR") governs LIRAB proceedings. See Haw. 
Admin. R. Â§ 12-47-1. HAR Â§ 12-47-22 provides that the LIRAB "may enter a pretrial order," establishing, in part, discovery deadlines, and "may impose administrative sanctions as described in section 12-47-48 for noncompliance with the board's order." HAR Â§ 12-47-48 provides: 
Sanctions for contemptuous conduct.
 
(a) Any person whose conduct at any proceeding before the board or
before a member is deemed contemptuous by the presiding member, or
who has refused to comply with an order of the board, has refused
to adhere to reasonable standards of orderly and ethical conduct,
has failed to act in good faith, or has engaged in the continued
use of dilatory tactics, may be excluded from the proceeding. The
board may impose other sanctions, including dismissal of the
appeal.
 
(b) If a witness refuses to answer any question which has
been ruled to be proper, the presiding member may strike all
testimony previously given by the witness on related
matters.
 
Haw. Admin. R. Â§ 12-47-48. Additionally, the LIRAB has wide
 
discretion to control the admission or exclusion of evidence.
 
The [LIRAB] shall not be bound by statutory and common law
rules relating to the admission or rejection of evidence.
The [LIRAB] may exercise its own discretion in these
matters, limited only by considerations of relevancy,
materiality, and repetition, by the rules of privilege
recognized by law, and with a view to securing a just,
speedy, and inexpensive determination of the proceedings.
 
Haw. Admin. R. Â§ 12-47-41; see also Sugano v. Dep't of Atty.
 
Gen., No. 29246, 2010 WL 231100, at *3 (Haw. Ct. App. Jan. 22,
 2010) (SDO) (holding that LIRAB's decision to admit previously
 suppressed medical report into evidence was not an abuse of
 discretion). More generally, HAR Â§ 12-47-1 provides that these
 rules "shall be construed to secure the just, speedy, and
 inexpensive determination of every proceeding." Haw. Admin. R.
 Â§ 12-47-1.
 
It is within the LIRAB's discretion to exclude untimely
 
discovery. See Tautua v. BCI Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Los
 
Angeles, No. 30291, 2012 WL 2308162, at *2 (Haw. Ct. App. June
 18, 2012) (SDO) (affirming the LIRAB's exclusion of two medical
 reports generated after the agency hearing). That discretion,
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
however, is not limitless; both generally and as to evidentiary
 
matters, equitable considerations apply. See Haw. Admin. R.
 
Â§ 12-47-1 (requiring that the LIRAB Rules be construed to secure
 a "just, speedy, and inexpensive determination" (emphasis
 added)); Â§ 12-47-41 (directing that discretion in evidentiary
 matters be similarly guided). The LIRAB Rules also provide that
 pretrial orders are amendable where "manifest injustice" would
 otherwise result. Haw. Admin. R. Â§ 12-47-22.
 
Sanctions for a discovery violation "must be 
commensurate with the offense." See Weinberg v. Dickson-
Weinberg, 123 Hawai' i 68, 75, 229 P.3d 1133, 1140 (2010). 
"Accordingly, the imposition of a sanction . . . requires 'an analysis of the relevant facts and circumstances that resulted in the exercise of discretion.'" Id. at 76, 229 P.3d at 1141 
(quoting Maddox v. Stone, 921 A.2d 912, 919 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 2007)). 
The fact that trial on the matter did not proceed as
 
scheduled on October 8, 2007, but was continued, first, to
 November 2, 2007, and subsequently twice more to November 10,
 2008, lessens the prejudice to the Employer from the belated
 disclosures, but does not compel us to find an abuse of
 discretion. Indeed, if courts, administrative bodies, and
 opposing parties were required to waive discovery deadlines as a
 condition of any agreement or decision to extend a hearing date,
 such extensions would likely be rarely granted. In this case,
 each of the extensions was at the request of Gabriel's counsel,
 and was explicitly conditioned upon maintenance of the August 13,
 2007 discovery deadline. 
The interest of a trial court or an administrative
 
agency in controlling its calendar and the process by which it
 will address complaints and schedule proceedings is itself
 significant, but must be balanced against the rights and
 interests of proceeding participants. Here, Gabriel's Witness
 List, which included Dr. McCaffrey, and Dr. McCaffreyâs 2007
 Report were filed approximately one week and six weeks,
 respectively, beyond the applicable discovery deadline. Dr.
 McCaffrey's identity as a witness, however, had been disclosed in
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
both Gabriel's initial conference statement and the Employer's
 
own Witness List. On the other hand, Dr. McCaffrey's 2007
 Report, unlike his 2006 Report, was submitted only in the context
 of the September 28, 2007 letter from Gabriel's counsel asking
 that the letter be treated as a motion in limine to permit
 receipt of the report.
 After hearing argument from both parties regarding
 
Employer's Motion to Strike, the LIRAB explained its basis for
 excluding Dr. McCaffrey's testimony and his 2007 Report:
 
The [LIRAB] rules that [Dr. McCaffrey] will not be allowed
to testify in this matter because he was untimely identified
as [a] live witness[]. Further, to make it clear as to
. . . how we are ruling on the evidentiary matters, medical
records obtained or generated after August 13, 2007, shall
similarly be excluded from appeal. 
Now, I don't believe that that will preclude the parties
from presenting evidence on the three points on appeal. Of
 course, I would expect the litigants to feel differently
about that.
 
Upon consideration, we conclude that the LIRAB abused
 
its discretion in excluding Dr. McCaffrey's testimony altogether. 
While Gabriel's Witness List was filed one week late, Dr.
 McCaffrey was listed as a witness on Gabriel's initial conference
 statement and on Employer's Witness List. Moreover, Dr.
 McCaffrey's 2006 Report was reviewed and addressed by Employer's
 experts. Under the circumstances, denying Dr. McCaffrey the
 opportunity to address the Employer's critique of his report
 effectively precluded Gabriel of what was arguably her only
 opportunity to present testimony that might have supported her
 claim. Cf. Dudley v. Huizenga, 667 N.W.2d 644, 650 (S.D. 2003)
 
("[T]he ALJ had authority to impose sanctions for failure to
 timely disclose; however, . . . den[ying] . . . a hearing on the
 merits . . . was too harsh and constituted an abuse of
 discretion.").
 
To the contrary, however, the LIRAB did not abuse its
 
discretion in declining to permit introduction of Dr. McCaffrey's
 2007 Report. The LIRAB reasonably established the August 13,
 2007 discovery deadline, and consistently thereafter ruled that
 the deadline remained in force, irrespective of the extensions to
 the hearing date that it granted to Gabriel's counsel. Discovery
 deadlines exist for reasons beyond merely preventing prejudice,
 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
see Haw. Admin. R. Â§ 12-47-41, and the LIRAB's amenability to
 
such extensions provides no basis to excuse untimeliness. 
Gabriel did not provide a reasonable explanation for her failure
 to obtain Dr. McCaffrey's 2007 Report before the discovery
 deadline. Dr. McCaffrey's 2007 Report was therefore plainly and
 inexcusably untimely. Gabriel has not established that the LIRAB
 abused it discretion in declining to permit its introduction. 
See Haw. Admin. R. Â§Â§ 12-47-41, -48.
 
B. Gabriel's second and third points of error. 
In light of our decision to vacate the March 24, 2009
 
Decision and Order and to remand the case to the LIRAB, we need
 
not address Gabriel's second or third points of error, which will
 necessarily be revisited on remand. 
V. CONCLUSION
 
The LIRAB's March 24, 2009 Decision and Order is
 
vacated and the case is remanded to the LIRAB for further
 
proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
