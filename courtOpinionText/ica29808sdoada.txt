NO. 29808
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
MELVIN FREITAS, JR., Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P. NO. 09-1-0010)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Melvin Freitas, Jr. (Freitas)
 
appeals the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order
 
Denying Petition for Post-Conviction Relief Without a Hearing,
 
filed on April 13, 2009 (Post-Conviction Order) in the Circuit
 
Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court).1
 
On June 26, 1997, Freitas was found guilty of three
 
counts of Kidnapping, one count of Robbery in the Second Degree,
 
one count of Assault in the Second Degree, one count of
 
Terroristic Threatening in the First Degree, and one count of
 
Assault in the Third Degree. Freitas was sentenced to an
 
extended term of imprisonment. On October 23, 1998, this court
 
found that the charge of Robbery in the Second Degree merged with
 
Assault in the Second Degree and vacated the conviction for
 
Assault in the Second Degree. On June 14, 2000, Freitas was
 
resentenced to the same terms of imprisonment, except for the
 
sentence for Assault in the Second Degree.
 
On April 11, 2002, Freitas filed a petition for post-
conviction relief (First Petition) (S.P.P. No. 02-1-0028),
 
pursuant to the Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40
 
which was denied.

On December 1, 2004, Freitas filed another petition for
 
post-conviction relief (Second Petition) (S.P.P. No. 04-1-0096),
 
pursuant to HRPP Rule 40. One of the grounds for relief in the
 
Second Petition was that his extended term sentence violated
 
Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000) and Blakely v.
 
Washington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004). On May 13, 2005, the Second
 
Petition was denied by the Circuit Court. On November 28, 2006,
 
this court affirmed the Circuit Court's denial of the Second
 
Petition in No. 27342.
 
On February 20, 2009, Freitas filed a third petition 
for post-conviction relief (Third Petition), pursuant to HRPP 
Rule 40. Freitas asserted his extended term of imprisonment was 
illegal because State v. Maugaotega, 115 Hawai 'i 432, 168 P.3d 
562 (2007) (Maugaotega II), invalidated Hawaii Revised Statutes 
ยง 706-662, and that Maugaotega II applies retroactively to his 
extended term sentencing. On January 27, 2009, the Circuit Court 
entered the Post-Conviction Order, which denied the Third 
Petition. On appeal, Freitas asserts the same ground for relief 
as in the Third Petition. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Freitas's points of error as follows:
 
Maugaotega II does not apply retroactively to Freitas's
 
conviction and sentence, which became final in 2000. See Loher
 
v. State, 118 Hawai 'i 522, 537-38, 193 P.3d 438, 453-54 (App. 
2008). Freitas's sentence to an extended term of imprisonment 
was not void ab initio. See State v. Jess, 117 Hawai 'i 381, 184 
P.3d 133 (2008) and Loher, supra; State v. Cutsinger, 118 Hawai 'i 
68, 81, 185 P.3d 816, 829 (App. 2008), overruled in part on other grounds by State v. Jess, 117 Hawai
'i 381, 184 P.3d 133 (2008).
