STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
JAMES SCOTT GOMES, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
KANEOHE DIVISION
(HPD Traffic No. 1DTA-09-00318)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant James Scott Gomes (Gomes) appeals
the judgment entered on April 28, 2009, in the District Court of
the First Circuit, K ~ne#ohe Division (district court).1
Gomes was convicted of Operating a Vehicle Under the
Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii
Revised Statutes ยง 291E-61(a) (Supp. 2009).
On appeal, Gomes contends the written complaint and
oral charge were insufficient because they failed to state an
essential element of the charge, i.e., that Gomes operated or
assumed actual physical control of a vehicle upon a public way,
street, road, or highway.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Gomes's point of error as follows:
Prior to trial, Gomes moved to dismiss the charge
because it failed to allege all the essential elements of the
OVUII offense.  The district court denied Gomes's motion.  "[T]he
operation of a vehicle on a public way, street, road, or highway
is an attendant circumstance of the offense of OUVII, and is
therefore an element of the offense."  State v. Wheeler,NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2121 Hawai #i 383, 393, 219 P.3d 1170, 1180 (2009).  The failure to
allege that Gomes was driving a vehicle upon a public way,
street, road, or highway at the time of the offense rendered the
charge deficient.  Id.
Therefore,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the April 28, 2009 judgment
of the District Court of the First Circuit, K ~ne#ohe Division is
vacated and the matter is remanded to the district court with
instructions to dismiss the charge without prejudice.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, February 25, 2010.
