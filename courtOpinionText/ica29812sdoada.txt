STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
LARRY F. EBUENG, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
HONOLULU DIVISION
(HPD TRAFFIC NO. 1DTC-08-45095
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Larry F. Ebueng (Ebueng) appeals
from the judgment entered on April 8, 2009 in the District Court
of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division ( District Court ).1 
Ebueng was convicted of Excessive Speeding, in violation of HRS ยง
291C-105(a)(1) (Supp. 2009).
On appeal, Ebueng contends, inter alia, that the
District Court erred by denying his motion in limine because the
State failed to adduce the requisite foundation for admissibility
of the laser gun speed reading.  Ebueng argues that "[t]he State
failed to adduce sufficient evidence to prove every element of
the offense beyond a reasonable doubt." 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Ebueng's points of error as follows:
As the State acknowledges on appeal, the State failed
to adduce evidence that the laser gun was tested according to the
manufacturer's recommended procedures in order to establish
sufficient foundation for the laser gun reading.2  See State v.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2Assaye, 121 Hawai# i 204, 210-14, 216 P.3d 1227, 1233-37 (2009). 
Without the laser gun reading, there was insufficient evidence t
convict Ebueng of Excessive Speeding.  Accordingly, we need not
address Ebueng's other points of error.o
For this reason, the District Court's April 8, 2009
judgment is reversed.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, February 25, 2010.
