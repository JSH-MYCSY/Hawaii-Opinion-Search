NO. 29814
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
GABRIEL H. DRILL, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-08-09633)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER

 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley, Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Gabriel H. Drill (Drill) appeals
 
from the portion of the Judgment entered on April 8, 2009, in the
 
1
 that
 District Court of the First Circuit (district court)
pertains to Drill's conviction and sentenced on the charge of
 
operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant (OVUII),
 in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 291E-61(a) and
 (b)(3) (Supp. 2008).
 

 On appeal, Drill argues that the district court erred
by denying his motion to dismiss the OVUII charge because the

 
written complaint and oral charge failed to state an essential
 element of the offense, namely, that Drill operated or assumed
 actual physical control of a vehicle upon a public way, street,
 road, or highway.

Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai 'i (State) concedes 
error based on State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai 'i 383, 219 P.3d 1170 
(2009), and it requests that Drill's OVUII conviction be vacated and that the case be remanded to the district court with instructions to dismiss the OVUII charge without prejudice. 
1 The Honorable William A. Cardwell presided.
 
2 Drill moved pretrial to dismiss the OVUII charge as
insufficient and the district court denied Drill's motion before
 
trial.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, we resolve Drill's point of error on
 
appeal as follows:
 
"[T]he operation [or the assumption of actual physical 
control] of a vehicle on a public way, street, road, or highway is an attendant circumstance of the offense of OVUII, and is therefore an element of the offense." Wheeler, 121 Hawai
'i at 
393, 219 P.3d at 1180. The OVUII charge brought against Drill was insufficient because it failed to allege that Drill operated and/or assumed actual physical control of a vehicle upon a public way, street, road, or highway. Id. 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the portion of the district
 
court's April 8, 2009, Judgment that pertains to Drill's
 conviction and sentence on the OVUII charge is vacated, and the
 case is remanded to the district court with instructions to
 dismiss the OVUII charge without prejudice.
