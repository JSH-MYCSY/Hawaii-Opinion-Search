MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Dino Kaipo Granito (Husband)

 
appeals from the April 16, 2009 order of the Family Court of the
 
1
First Circuit (family court),  which denied Husband's February 2,
2009 "Motion for New Trial or Alternatively, to Reconsider and/or
 
Relief from the Decree, issued January 22, 2009."
 
By the decree entered January 22, 2009, the family

 
court dissolved the marriage between Husband and Gena Lopresti
 
Granito, now known as Gena Lopresti (Wife), awarded Wife sole
 
legal and physical custody of the couple's daughter (Daughter)
 
subject to visitation by Husband, levied monthly child support of
 
$870.00 on Husband, and distributed the couple's marital property
 
and debts.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI rI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues
 
raised, we resolve Husband's points on appeal as follows:
 
(1) Husband argues that the family court erred by not
 
granting his February 2, 2009 motion on numerous grounds, all of
 
which concern matters of credibility. Husband's motion primarily
 
argued that the family court should revisit the decree's
 
provisions awarding custody of Daughter to Wife.
 
The determining factor in custody decisions is the best 
interests of the child. Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 571­
46(a)(1) (Supp. 2009); see also Doe v. Doe, 98 Hawai ri 144, 155­
56, 44 P.3d 1085, 1096-97 (2002). On August 23, 2007, the family court found that it was in the Daughter's best interests that 
Wife be awarded sole legal and physical custody of Daughter. 
Generally, such a determination, hinges upon the testimony of 
parents and other observers and their credibility. "[I]t is 
well-settled that an appellate court will not pass upon issues 
dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the 
evidence[.]" Inoue v. Inoue, 118 Hawai
ri 86, 101, 185 P.3d 834, 
849 (App. 2008). 
[T]he question on appeal is whether the record contains
substantial evidence supporting the family court's
determinations, and appellate review is thereby limited to
assessing whether those determinations are supported by
credible evidence of sufficient quality and probative value.
In this regard, the testimony of a single witness, if found
by the trier of fact to have been credible, will suffice.
 
Id. (quoting In re Jane Doe, 95 Hawai ri 183, 196-97, 20 P.3d 616, 
629-30 (2001)). In making its custody decision, the family court 
reconciled the conflicting testimonies of Husband and Wife and 
Wife's mother, and determined Daughter's best interests would be 
served by placing her in Wife's custody. This determination will 
not be disturbed on appeal. 
Husband alternatively argues that the court erred in
 
denying his request to reduce his child support obligation
 
because he had lost his job. At the hearing on Husband's
 
February 2, 2009 motion, the family court told Husband he could
 
file for relief from the decree "[i]f there are events which have
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI rI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
occurred after the divorce decree . . . which [Husband] feels are
 
a material change in circumstances." Husband subsequently raised
 
the child-support issue in his April 30, 2009 Motion for Post-
Decree Relief, in which he requested sole custody of Daughter and
 
a modification of child support "to reflect any change in
 
physical custody." Husband did not contend then that child
 
support should be lowered on account of his employment status,
 
regardless of a change in custody. Inasmuch as the family court
 
did not alter the terms of custody, it did not abuse its
 
discretion when it did not modify child support correspondingly. 
(2) Husband argues that the family court erred in
 
refusing to disqualify itself. In his motion to disqualify,
 
dated April 8, 2009, Husband argued that several rulings in
 
Wife's favor demonstrated that the family court was biased
 
against him. HRS § 601-7(b) (1993) requires that an affidavit
 
supporting a motion for disqualification must be "accompanied by
 
a certificate of counsel of record that the affidavit is made in
 
good faith." Husband's counsel did not file such a certificate. 
Thus, the family court did not abuse its discretion when it
 
denied without prejudice Husband's motion to disqualify on the
 
basis that Husband's affidavit did not comply with HRS § 601­
7(b). In any event, the family court denied Husband's motion
 
without prejudice and no subsequent motion appears of record.
 
(3) Husband argues that the family court erred by "not
 
dividing the net market value of Husband's Las Vegas house
 
properly in accordance with our existing case law."
 
Under Hawai ri law, Marital Partnership Property, which 
in this case includes a house in Las Vegas, is to be distributed 
by the schema outlined in Tougas v. Tougas, 76 Hawai ri 19, 868 
P.2d 437 (1994), which places the property in one of five categories. Category 1 and Category 5 are relevant to this case. 
According to Tougas, 
Category 1 [includes] [t]he net market value (NMV), plus or
minus, of all property separately owned by one spouse on the
date of marriage (DOM) but excluding the NMV attributable to
property that is subsequently legally gifted by the owner to
the other spouse, to both spouses, or to a third party.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI rI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
. . . .
 
Category 5 [includes] [t]he difference between the NMVs,
plus or minus, of all property owned by one or both of the
spouses on the [date of the conclusion of the evidentiary
part of trial (DOCOEPOT)] minus the NMVs, plus or minus,
includable in categories 1, 2, 3, and 4.
 
76 Hawai ri at 27, 868 P.2d at 445 (quoting Malek v. Malek, 7 Haw. 
App. 377, 380-81 n.1, 768 P.2d 243, 246-47 n.1 (1989)). 
Category 1 comprises "'partner's contributions' to the 
Marital Partnership Property that, assuming all valid and 
relevant considerations are equal, are repaid to the contributing 
spouse" while the net market values of Category 5, "assuming all 
valid and relevant considerations are equal, are awarded one-half 
to each spouse." Helbush v. Helbush, 108 Hawai ri 508, 513-14, 
122 P.3d 288, 293-94 (App. 2005) (citation omitted). The party claiming a return of Category 1 property has the burden of 
proving that he or she is entitled to it. See Gussin v. Gussin, 
9 Haw. App. 279, 283, 836 P.2d 498, 501 (1991) ("All DOCOEPOT NMVs are Category 5 NMVs except to the extent that they are 
proven to be Category 1, 2, 3, or 4 NMVs."); see also Booth v. 
Booth, 90 Hawai
ri 413, 416, 978 P.2d 851, 854 (1999) (citing In 
re Marriage of Tyrrell, 477 N.E.2d 523, 524 (Ill. App. Ct. 1985) ("Where a party does not offer evidence of an asset's value, the 
party cannot complain as to the disposition of that asset by the 
court.")). 
Here the decree ordered Husband and Wife to split
 
evenly the difference between the fair market value of the house
 
on the date of marriage and appraised fair market value of the
 
house given at trial, provided that if the house were sold or
 
foreclosed upon the outstanding mortgage should be paid first and
 
then any remaining equity divided evenly between Husband and
 
Wife. The decree's provisions regarding the distributions from
 
any future sale or foreclosure, in effect, treat the property as
 
Category 5 property, as the net proceeds of the voluntary or
 
forced sale of the property will be divided equally by the
 
parties. However, as the family court also awarded Husband
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI rI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
$220,000 as his Category 1 property, paragraphs 7(e) and 7(e)(1)
 
of the January 22, 2009 Decree appear to be in irreconcilable
 
conflict.
 
To the extent Husband challenges the treatment of loans
 
by Wife's mother, now deceased, to satisfy mortgage payments,
 
Husband failed to show how the family court abused its
 
discretion. Because these payments helped to maintain the
 
mortgage that is Husband's liability, it was not inequitable to
 
order Husband to repay Wife's mother's estate.
 
(4) Husband claims the family court erred by awarding
 
Wife $66,587.90 in attorney's fees, because this award duplicated
 
an earlier award of $4,404.40 to Wife for attorney's fees. We
 
disagree. The attorney's fee awards covered work done by two
 
different attorneys in preparation for different trials and for
 
the completion of several post-trial motions. The fee awards are
 
clearly not duplicative. The family court did not abuse its
 
discretion in awarding the fees to Wife.
 
(5) Husband argues that the family court erred in 
"allowing [Wife] to move [Daughter] to the Big Island." In 
response to Wife's April 1, 2009 Motion for Post-Decree Relief, 
the family court told Wife that "she does not require the Court's 
permission to relocate." Additionally, the family court found 
"that there has been no material change in circumstances" given 
that Wife stipulated that she will maintain terms of the decree 
and pay the costs of transporting Daughter to and from the Big 
Island. Given that this court accepts the findings of the trial 
court when they hinge on the credibility of witnesses, Inoue, 118 
Hawairi at 101, 185 P.3d at 849, this court will not disturb the 
finding that there is no material change in Daughter's situation. The family court did not abuse its discretion in granting Wife's 
motion and denying Husband's contrary motion for custody of 
Daughter. 
(6) Husband argues that the family court's failure to 
make the findings of fact and conclusions of law required by Rule 
52 of the Hawai
ri Family Court Rules (HFCR) constitutes 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI rI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
reversible error, but he cites no authority for this position. 
HFCR Rule 52(a) requires that "upon notice of appeal filed with 
the court, the court shall enter its findings of fact and 
conclusions of law where none have been entered, unless the 
written decision of the court contains findings of fact and 
conclusions of law." See also State v. Gonsales, 91 Hawai ri 446, 
449, 984 P.2d 1272, 1275 (App. 1999) (per curiam) ("[U]pon the filing of an appeal, the family court is mandated, where HFCR 
Rule 52(a) is applicable, to enter written findings and 
conclusions, unless they were previously set forth in a written 
decision or decision and order.") (emphasis added). Given the 
family court made written findings previously, its failure to 
enter additional findings until January 13, 2010, after Husband 
filed his Opening Brief, neither violated HFCR Rule 52(a) nor 
prejudiced Husband. This is not a reversible error. 
Based on the foregoing, the case is remanded to the
 
family court for the purpose of clarifying paragraphs 7(e) and
 
7(e)(1) of the January 22, 2009 Decree. In all other respects,
 
the April 16, 2009 order of the Family Court of the First
 
Circuit, denying Husband's motion for new trial, reconsideration,
 
or relief from the January 22, 2009 divorce decree is affirmed.
