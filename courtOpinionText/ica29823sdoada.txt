IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
JOHN D. EDDINGTON, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(Case No. 1DTC-08-045099)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant John D. Eddington (Eddington)
 
appeals from the Judgment filed on April 17, 2009 in the District
 
Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (district court).1
 
The district court found Eddington guilty of Excessive Speeding,
 in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes § 291C-105(a)(1) (2007
 
Repl. & Supp. 2009). 
On August 8, 2008, Officer Maeshiro cited Eddington for
 
driving 68 miles per hour on a public roadway with a speed limit
 
of 35 miles per hour. Officer Maeshiro determined Eddington's
 
speed by using the LTI 20/20 hand-held laser speed detection unit
 
(laser gun).
 
On February 27, 2009, Eddington filed Defendant's 
Motions [sic] in Limine. Eddington requested an order requiring 
the State of Hawai
'i (State) to show among other things that 
Officer Maeshiro had been properly trained and that "the pre­operational checking procedures recommended by the manufacturer 
of the laser speed detector be shown to have been made by the law 
enforcement officer . . . ." The district court denied 
Defendant's Motions in Limine on April 17, 2009. 
On appeal, Eddington argues that (1) the district court
 
erred in denying his Motion to Compel Discovery or in the
 
Alternative, Motion to Dismiss for Violation of Rule 16(b) and
 
1

(c) of the Hawai 'i Rules of Penal Procedure; (2) the district 
court erred in admitting into evidence the results of the laser 
gun without sufficient foundation; and (3) without the evidence 
of the laser gun results, there was insufficient evidence to 
convict Eddington. The State concedes that it failed to lay 
sufficient foundation for admission of the laser gun speed 
reading. 
At trial, Officer Maeshiro could not testify that the 
laser gun was tested in accordance with the manufacturer's 
specifications. Therefore, the State failed to adduce sufficient 
evidence regarding the accuracy of the laser gun. In the absence 
of an adequate foundation establishing the accuracy and 
reliability of the laser gun, the laser gun reading should not 
have been admitted into evidence. State v. Assaye, 121 Hawai 'i 
204, 210-14, 216 P.3d 1227, 1233-37 (2009). Without evidence of the laser gun reading, there is insufficient evidence to convict 
Eddington of Excessive Speeding. We need not address Eddington's 
other point of error. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment filed on
 
April 17, 2009 in the District Court of the First Circuit,
 Honolulu Division, is reversed.
