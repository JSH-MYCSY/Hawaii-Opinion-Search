STATE OF HAWAI rI, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
THOMAS A. MARZEC, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(Case No. 1DTI-08-126372)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Thomas A. Marzec (Marzec) appeals 
the "Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment" entered on April 16, 2009, in the District Court of the First 
Circuit, Honolulu Division (district court).
1 A judgment was 
entered against Marzec for Speeding, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 291C-102(a)(1) (2007) for an incident on 
July 14, 2008. 
On appeal, Marzec contends that (1) "[t]he trial court 
was wrong to not provide, upon motion, requested findings and 
conclusions" and that "[t]he trial court was wrong and abused its 
discretion in providing unclear and inadequate findings and 
conclusions on the record;" (2) "[t]he State did not prove or 
even address, and the trial court did not find or conclude, that 
this case involving a laser gun met the requirements in 
State v. 
Assaye, 121 Hawai ri 204, 209-14, 216 P.3d 1227, 1232-37 (2009);" 
(3) "[t]he trial court was wrong and/or abused its discretion by
 
allowing into evidence general testimony throughout the trial,
 
from the State's only witness, the police officer;" (4) "[t]he
 
trial court was wrong and/or abused their [sic] discretion in
 
denying Marzec's photo and video exhibits as evidence, ruling
 
them not relevant, and would not even allow the videos to be

played while cross-examining the State's only witness;"
 
(5) "[t]he trial court's bias and lack of impartiality was
 
prejudicial to Marzec; thereby wrongly depriving Marzec of a fair
 
trial, to include plain error in trial court and State actions."
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Marzec's points of error as follows.
 
(1) The district court did not abuse its discretion in 
denying Marzec's motion to enter written findings of fact and 
conclusions of law, where (a) no requirement exists therefor 
under HRS Chapter 291D, the Hawai ri Civil Traffic Rules (HCTR) 
that govern civil infraction cases in district courts (HCTR Rule 2), or under the Hawai
ri Rules of Penal Procedure, Rules of 
the District Court, or the Hawai ri Rules of Evidence that govern 
the trial proceedings pursuant to HCTR Rule 19; (b) the findings 
of fact and conclusions entered orally on the record were 
sufficient; and (c) Marzec fails to demonstrate any harm suffered 
from the absence of written findings of fact and conclusions of 
law. 
(2) Marzec waived his challenge to Officer Michael 
McKinney's (Officer McKinney) testimony regarding the laser gun 
reading where Marzec failed to object to a lack of foundation at 
trial, and no basis for plain error review exits. State v. 
Wallace, 80 Hawai ri 382, 410, 910 P.2d 695, 723 (1996); State v. 
Naeole, 62 Haw. 563, 570, 617 P.2d 820, 826 (1980). 
(3) The district court did not err in permitting and
 
considering Officer McKinney's testimony of habit and routine
 
practice, particularly where Marzec did not object to such
 
testimony. State v. Okuda, 71 Haw. 434, 449-50, 795 P.2d 1, 9-10
 
(1990); State v. Bloss, 3 Haw. App. 274, 277-79, 649 P.2d 1176,
 1178-79 (1982).
 
(4) The district court did not abuse its discretion in
 
excluding Marzec's photographs and video, where they did not
 
"substantially depict the area as it existed" on the date of the
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI rI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
incident. State v. Sequin, 73 Haw. 331, 338, 832 P.2d 269, 273
 
(1992).
 
(5) Marzec fails to demonstrate bias of the district 
court. The district court is permitted wide discretion in 
"determining courtroom procedure" and to "avoid needless 
consumption of time." See State v. Christian, 88 Hawai ri 407, 
422, 967 P.2d 239, 254 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted) (recognizing the trial court's discretion in controlling the 
courtroom). As such, permitting the State to call cases in court 
does not reflect judicial bias. Similarly, the district court's 
denial of a continuance does not amount to judicial bias, where 
Marzec did not detail the reasons for the continuance, except 
generally stating that "a continuance would allow Marzec to 
present a meaningful case" and where the State objected, 
asserting that it had issued its subpoena. As to the district 
court drawing reasonable inferences from Marzec's being on his 
cell phone while driving, "[t]he trier of fact may draw all 
reasonable and legitimate inferences and deductions from the 
evidence adduced from admitted or known facts[.]" Lono v. State, 
63 Haw. 470, 473, 629 P.2d 630, 633 (1981), citing State v. Herrera, 63 Haw. 405, 629 P.2d 626 (1981). The district court's 
solitary reference to Marzec's cell phone use being citable for 
inattention to driving, even if inaccurate, does not demonstrate 
judicial bias. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the April 16, 2009 Judgment
 
of the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division, is
 
affirmed.

ri, August 10, 2010.
