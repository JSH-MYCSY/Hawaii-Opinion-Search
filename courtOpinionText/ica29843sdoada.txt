IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
ROLANDO YAGIN, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 

 (CR. NO. 08-1-0115)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Rolando Yagin (Yagin) appeals from
 
the Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence (Judgment)
 
filed on April 23, 2009 in the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit
 (circuit court).
1 A jury convicted Yagin of Disorderly Conduct,
 
in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 711-1101(1)(a)
 (1993 & Supp. 2009) (Count 1), and Resisting Arrest, in violation
 of HRS ยง 710-1026(1)(a) (1993 & Supp. 2009) (Count 2). The
 circuit court sentenced Yagin to pay a $500 fine on Count 1 and
 to one year of probation, a jail term of 15 days, payment of
 various fees, and 100 hours of community service on Count 2.
 
On appeal, Yagin contends the circuit court (1) 
reversibly erred when it denied his request for substitute
 counsel and the motion to withdraw filed by his court-appointed
 counsel, Deputy Public Defender Dena Renti Cruz (Cruz), and (2)
 violated his right to effective assistance of counsel pursuant to

 The Honorable Randal G.B. Valenciano presided.

article I, section 14 of the Hawai 'i Constitution and the Sixth 
Amendment to the United States Constitution. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Yagin's
 points of error as follows:
 
(1) The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in 
denying Yagin's request for substitute counsel. Regardless of whether the circuit court conducted a "penetrating and comprehensive examination" when Yagin first raised the question of substitute counsel, State v. Kane, 52 Haw. 484, 487, 479 P.2d 207, 209 (1971), the record shows that through subsequent hearings, the court obtained sufficient information to determine and rule on the basis of Yagin's request. See State v. Kossman, 
101 Hawai
'i 112, 119-21, 63 P.3d 420, 427-29 (App. 2003); United 
States v. John Doe No. 1, 272 F.3d 116, 123 (2d. Cir. 2001). 
(a) Yagin's allegation that Cruz told him "that
 
pretty much [he had] no case" and therefore she would not fully
 represent him does not rise to the level of good cause for
 substitution of counsel. See State v. Ahlo, 2 Haw. App. 462,
 
469, 634 P.2d 421, 426 (1981); McKee v. Harris, 649 F.2d 927,
 932-33 (2d Cir. 1981). 
(b) The circuit court adequately addressed the
 
dispute between Yagin and Cruz over the relevance of certain
 evidence by holding a hearing and ruling on whether certain
 witnesses had relevant evidence and would be allowed to testify.
 
(2) For the same reasons given for upholding the
 
circuit court's denial of Yagin's request for substitute counsel,
 we hold that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying
 Cruz's motion to withdraw.
 
(3) Yagin argues that he was denied effective 
assistance of counsel because Cruz failed to call alleged exculpatory witnesses at trial. We reject this claim because the record does not contain affidavits or sworn statements describing the testimonies of the proffered witnesses that are necessary to support it. See State v. Richie, 88 Hawai
'i 19, 39, 960 P.2d

1227, 1247 (1998); see also State v. Fukusaku, 85 Hawai 'i 462, 
481, 946 P.2d 32, 51 (1997); State v. Aplace, 74 Haw. 54, 70, 837 
P.2d 1298, 1307 (1992). However, we deny Yagin's ineffective assistance of counsel claim without prejudice to his raising it through a Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 40 petition. See 
State v. Silva, 75 Hawai 'i 419, 439, 864 P.2d 583, 592-93 (1993). 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment of Conviction
 
and Probation Sentence filed on April 23, 2009 in the Circuit
 Court of the Fifth Circuit is affirmed.
