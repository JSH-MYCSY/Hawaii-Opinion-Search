STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
SCOTT A. LIESEMEYER, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
Honolulu Division
(HPD Traffic No. 1DTA-09-00391)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley, and Leonard, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Scott A. Liesemeyer (Liesemeyer)
appeals from the Judgment filed on April 28, 2009, in the
District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (district
court).1/
 Liesemeyer was convicted of Operating a Vehicle Under
the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii
Revised Statutes §§ 291E-61(a)(1) and (b)(1) (Supp. 2008). 
On appeal, Liesemeyer contends that the district court
erred by denying his motion to dismiss the OVUII charge because
the written complaint and the oral charge failed to state an
essential element of the offense, namely, that Liesemeyer
operated or assumed actual physical control of a vehicle upon a
public way, street, road, or highway.2/NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties, we resolve Liesemeyer's point of error
as follows:
 "[T]he operation [or the assumption of actual physical
control] of a vehicle on a public way, street, road, or highway
is an attendant circumstance of the offense of OVUII, and is
therefore an element of the offense."  State v. Wheeler, 121
Hawai#i 383, 393, 219 P.3d 1170, 1180 (2009).  The OVUII charge
brought against Liesemeyer was insufficient because it failed to
allege that Liesemeyer operated or assumed actual physical
control of a vehicle upon a public way, street, road, or highway. 
Id. 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the April 28, 2009, Judgment
of the district court is vacated, and this case is remanded to
the district court with instructions to dismiss the OVUII charge
without prejudice.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, March 19, 2010.
