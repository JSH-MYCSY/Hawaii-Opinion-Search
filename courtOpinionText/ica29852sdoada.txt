IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
JASON ERIC THON, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
LIHU'E DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 5DTA-08-00415)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise and Leonard, JJ.,
with Nakamura, C.J., concurring separately)
 
Defendant-Appellant Jason Eric Thon (Thon) appeals the 
Judgment, entered on April 30, 2009, in the District Court of the 
Fifth Circuit, L lhu'e Division (district court).1 
On April 30, 2009, Thon pled no contest to Operating a
 
Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in
 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 291E-61(a) and (b)
 
(Supp. 2009).
 
In Thon's Opening Brief, filed on October 9, 2009, Thon
 
contends the district court erred by denying his Motion to
 
Suppress and Exclude Intoxilyzer Test, filed on March 4, 2009
 
(Motion to Suppress). Thon contends the district court's
 
conclusion that the State complied with HRS ยง 291E-11 and that
 
the traffic stop was not pretextual were erroneous.
 
The State argues that the district court did not err by 
denying Thon's Motion to Suppress. The State also argues that 
State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai 'i 383, 219 P.3d 1170 (2009), issued 
on November 17, 2009, is inapplicable or that any deficiency in the charge was waived when Thon entered into a no contest plea. 
In Thon's Reply Brief, filed on January 4, 2010, he
 
raises a claim that the charge against Thon was deficient

pursuant to Wheeler because it failed to state that Thon operated
 
or assumed actual physical control of a vehicle upon a public
 
way, street, road, or highway.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Thon's points of error as follows:
 
(1) Although Thon entered into a no contest plea, he
 
may still challenge the sufficiency of the charge on the grounds
 
that there is a defect bearing upon the State's authority to
 
compel him to answer to the charge in court. State v. Morin, 71
 
Haw. 159, 162, 785 P.2d 1316, 1318 (1990).
 
(2) "[T]he operation of a vehicle on a public way, 
street, road, or highway is an attendant circumstance of the offense of OVUII, and is therefore an element of the offense." 
Wheeler, 121 Hawai
'i at 393, 219 P.3d at 1180. The failure to 
allege that Thon was driving a vehicle upon a public way, street, road, or highway at the time of the offense rendered the charge 
fatally deficient. Id. Therefore, the charge must be dismissed 
for lack of jurisdiction and we need not address Thon's other point of error. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment, entered on 
April 30, 2009, in the District Court of the Fifth Circuit, L
lhu'e Division is vacated. The matter is remanded to the 
district court with instructions to dismiss the OVUII charge without prejudice.
