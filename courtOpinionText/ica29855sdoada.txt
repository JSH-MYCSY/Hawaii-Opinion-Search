v.
 
AVEI MOEVAO, Defendant-Appellee,
and
 
AAA LOCAL BAIL BONDS, Surety-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

 
(CR. NO. 08-1-0041)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER

 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Surety-Appellant AAA Local Bail Bonds (AAA) appeals
 
from the "Order Denying Motion to Set Aside Bail Bond Forfeiture
 
and Discharge Surety" filed on April 28, 2009 in the Circuit
 
1
Court of the First Circuit  (circuit court).
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs

 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude AAA's
 
appeal is without merit.

HRS ยง 804-51 (Supp. 2009) provides in relevant part: 
ยง804-51 Procedure.  Whenever the court, in any
criminal cause, forfeits any bond or recognizance given in a
criminal cause, the court shall immediately enter up
judgment in favor of the State . . . and shall cause
execution to issue thereon immediately after the expiration
of thirty days from the date that notice is given . . . to
the surety . . . unless, before the expiration of thirty
days from the date that notice is given to the surety, . . .
a motion . . . showing good cause why execution should not
issue upon the judgment, is filed with the court. 
(Emphases added.) Thus, a surety has thirty days after it
 
receives notice of the judgment and order of forfeiture of bail
 
bond to file a motion showing good cause as to why the judgment
 
should not be executed. 
The Hawai 'i Supreme Court in State v. Camara, 81 Hawai 'i 
324, 916 P.2d 1225 (1996), held that good cause "may be satisfied 
by the defendant, prior to the expiration of the thirty-day 
search period: (1) providing a satisfactory reason for his or her 
failure to appear when required; or (2) surrendering or being 
surrendered." Id. at 330, 916 P.2d at 1231 (emphasis added). 
In the instant case, the Judgment and Order of
 
Forfeiture of Bail Bond of Defendant Avei Moevao (Moevao) was
 
filed on January 21, 2009. The record indicates the date of
 
notice to AAA of the judgment and order that would start the
 
thirty-day period within which AAA could file a motion showing
 
good cause to stay the execution of the judgment of forfeiture
 
was January 29, 2009.
 
On March 19, 2009, about one-and-a-half months after
 
the judgment was filed, AAA filed a Motion to Set Aside Bail Bond
 
Forfeiture and Discharge Surety.2 AAA failed to file this motion
 
within the thirty-day period required by HRS ยง 804-51.
 
Therefore, 
2
 AAA's prior Motion to Set Aside Bond Forfeiture and Reinstate Bail
was withdrawn when the circuit court indicated it would deny the motion given
Moevao's failure to appear.
