IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
MIHO HAIGLER, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-CRIMINAL NO. 08-1-2327)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Miho Haigler ("Miho") appeals from
 
the May 20, 2009 Judgment of Conviction and Sentence of the
 
Family Court of the First Circuit ("Family Court").1 Miho was
 
convicted by the Family Court of Harassment under section 711­
2
1106, Hawaii Revised Statutes,  and sentenced to six months
probation. 
On appeal, Miho alleges that the Family Court erred: 
(1) because there was insufficient evidence to support Miho's
 conviction because her use of force against her husband, Kevin
 Haigler ("Kevin"), was justified as self-defense; (2) because
 there was insufficient evidence to support Miho’s conviction
 
1/
 The Honorable William J. Nagle III presided.
 
2/ Harassment.  (1) A person commits the offense of
harassment if, with intent to harass, annoy, or alarm
any other person, that person: 
(a)	 Strikes, shoves, kicks, or otherwise touches
another person in an offensive manner or
subjects the other person to offensive physical
contact[.]

AW. REV. STAT. § 711-1106(1)(a) (Supp. 2010).

where her use of force was justified in defense of her property;
 
and (3) in precluding Miho from introducing evidence of Kevin's
 prior bad acts which were relevant to Miho's state of mind on the
 date of the incident. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 affirm the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence and resolve Miho's
 points of error as follows:
 
(1) There was substantial evidence to negate Miho's
 
claim of self-defense and to support her conviction for
 harassment. 
[E]vidence adduced in the trial court must be considered in
the strongest light for the prosecution when the appellate
court passes on the legal sufficiency of such evidence to
support a conviction; the same standard applies whether the
case was before a judge or a jury. The test on appeal is
not whether guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt,
but whether there was substantial evidence to support the
conclusion of the trier of fact. Indeed, even if it could
be said in a bench trial that the conviction is against the
weight of the evidence, as long as there is substantial
evidence to support the requisite findings for conviction,
the trial court will be affirmed.
 
"Substantial evidence" as to every material element of
the offense charged is credible evidence which is of
sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of
reasonable caution to support a conclusion. And as trier of
 fact, the trial judge is free to make all reasonable and
rational inferences under the facts in evidence, including
circumstantial evidence.
 
State v. Matavale, 115 Hawai' i 149, 157-58, 166 P.3d 322, 330-31 
(2007) (brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Batson, 73 Haw. 236, 
248-49, 831 P.2d 924, 931 (1992)). 
Kevin testified that he worked two jobs. After
 
returning home from his second job at approximately 10:00 p.m. on
 December 4, 2008, Kevin observed that the couple's six-month old
 child, who had been teething for approximately one week, had a
 fever and appeared irritable, but was under Miho's care. Kevin
 and Miho argued about the babysitter's fee, with Miho wanting
 Kevin to pay all of the fee, instead of splitting it 50-50 as
 they had been doing. Kevin went to his room upstairs and fell
 asleep. 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Later that evening, Miho went into Kevin's room (Kevin
 
and Miho were in the process of getting divorced and slept in
 
separate rooms), "yelling, saying that the baby won't go to
 sleep." Miho "threw" the child at Kevin, saying "You take care
 of the baby." Kevin took the child and went downstairs and out
 to the garage. Miho went downstairs and out into the garage. 
Kevin told Miho that he was not going to pay the babysitter fee,
 "[a]nd that's when she started clawing me on my arms and my
 back." He then called the police and went back outside to wait
 for them. 
Police photographs from the evening of December 4, 2008
 
were introduced at trial, showing Kevin with scratch marks on his
 right arm and lower back. Kevin denied ever hitting Miho, but
 alluded to past physical altercations with her.
 
The Family Court concluded that: 
[T]the court can't find any instance in which [Miho]
testified that [Kevin] did anything beyond yell at her. In
 other words, [Kevin] did not push, shove, kick, punch, or
otherwise indicate a physical propensity against her at the
time.
 
. . . .
 
And very frankly the court simply doesn't buy
the idea that the scratches which are depicted in
Exhibits 3, 4, and 5 came from a glancing, accidental
scraping.
 
Since there was substantial evidence in support of Kevin's
 
version of the events, the Family Court's conclusion that Miho
 was not acting in self-defense was not clearly erroneous. See
 
State v. Pereira, No. 29361, 2009 WL 1763251 (Haw. Ct. App.
 June 23, 2009) (evidence supported at least three possible
 reasons for defendant's actions, two of which did not comport
 with defendant's claim of self-defense; therefore, court's
 conclusion was not clearly erroneous). 
(2) Miho's claim of defense of property was not raised
 
below. "Generally, the failure to properly raise an issue at the
 trial level precludes a party from raising that issue on appeal." 
State v. Hoglund, 71 Haw. 147, 150-51, 785 P.2d 1311, 1313
 (1990). 
Even if we were to consider the defense, however, the
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Family Court found Miho's version of the events of December 4, 
2008 to be less than credible. As an appellate court, we do not pass upon the trial judge's decisions with respect to the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence, because this is the province of the trial judge. State v. Eastman, 81 
Hawai'i 131, 139, 913 P.2d 57, 65 (1996). In sum, there was 
substantial evidence to negate Miho's claim of defense of property and to support her conviction for harassment. 
(3) The Family Court initially ruled in response to
 
Miho's notice of intent to use evidence of prior bad acts under
 Hawaii Rules of Evidence ("HRE") Rule 404 that it would allow
 evidence of the alleged incidents of July 26, 2008 and November
 2008 "for the purpose of negating the prosecution's evidence of
 intent as required in the harassment offense[,]" but that the
 incidents of "January 2007, June 2007, March 2008 and June 2008
 [(the "First Four Incidents")] either are too remote as a matter
 of probative value and/or are just not relevant to the issue of
 intent." 
It is not clear from the Family Court's statement which
 
of the First Four Incidents it found to be "not relevant to the
 issue of intent" and which it found were "too remote as a matter
 of probative value." 
"Prior bad act" evidence under [HRE] Rule 404(b) is
admissible when it is 1) relevant and 2) more probative than
prejudicial. A trial court's determination that evidence is
 "relevant" within the meaning of HRE Rule 401 (1993) . . .
is reviewed under the right/wrong standard of review.
However, a trial court's balancing of the probative value of
prior bad act evidence against the prejudicial effect of
such evidence under HRE Rule 403 is reviewed for abuse of
 discretion. An abuse of discretion occurs when the court
 clearly exceeds the bounds of reason or disregards rules or
principles of law to the substantial detriment of a party
litigant.
 
State v. Fetelee, 117 Hawai' i 53, 62-63, 175 P.3d 709, 718-19 
(2008) (brackets and original ellipses omitted) (quoting State v. 
Cordeiro, 99 Hawai' i 390, 403-04, 56 P.3d 692, 705-06 (2002)). 
Generally, evidence of an alleged victim's propensity
 
for violence is relevant to the issue of intent when the
 defendant has raised the issue of self-defense or defense of
 property against the victim. State v. Laferriere, 945 A.2d 1235,
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
1236 (Me. 2008) (trial court erred in excluding defendant's
 
testimony during bench trial that victim had been violent with
 him in the past when defendant claimed self-defense and defense
 of property); see also State v. Estrada, 69 Haw. 204, 214-15, 738
 P.2d 812, 820-21 (1987) (trial court erred in excluding evidence
 of past acts of violence and abuse perpetrated by victim when
 defendant claimed self-defense). "A defendant claiming self-
defense is allowed to introduce evidence of the victim's violent
 or aggressive character 'either to demonstrate the reasonableness
 of [defendant's] apprehension of immediate danger or to show that
 the [victim] was the aggressor.'" State v. Pascua, No. 30104,
 
2011 WL 794448, at *1 (Haw. Ct. App. Mar. 7, 2011) (brackets in
 original) (citing State v. Lui, 61 Haw. 328, 330, 603 P.2d 151,
 154 (1979)).
 
Determining the admissibility of relevant evidence 
under HRE 403, however, "is eminently suited to the trial court's exercise of its discretion." State v. Clark, 83 Hawai' i 289, 
302, 926 P.2d 194, 207 (1996) (quoting Sato v. Tawata, 79 Hawai' i 
14, 19, 897 P.2d 941, 946 (1995)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the Family Court received a detailed description of the evidence prior to trial and allowed Miho to introduce evidence on two of the six incidents. Thereafter, the Family Court permitted cross-examination on two more of the incidents.
3 
To the extent that the Family Court concluded that
 
evidence related to the First Four Incidents was more prejudicial
 than probative, we cannot say that the Family Court abused its
 discretion. In addition, any error associated with the Family
 Court's refusal to allow evidence of the two remaining incidents
 on the basis of relevance was harmless in light of the ample
 evidence of prior incidents admitted into the record.
 
3/
 Miho concedes that she was permitted to cross-examine Kevin on the
January and June 2007 incidents, but contends that "the court did not indicate
that it was rescinding its previous ruling precluding the defense from
adducing testimony on those incidents from Miho." Unstated is any reference
to Miho pursuing this avenue herself. Having allowed Miho to cross-examine
Kevin on the January and June 2007 incidents on the basis that the prosecution
opened the door, there was reason to believe that the Family Court might have
permitted further examination of Miho on those two incidents.
