10. Sexual assault in the first degree in violation
of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-730(1)(a) (Supp.
2003) against RC;
11. Sexual assault in the third degree in violation

on April 2, 
2004.
 
After an unsuccessful motion to dismiss the indictment,
 
on April 25, 2005, pursuant to a plea agreement, Carter entered a
 
plea of guilty to: charges of sexual assault in the second
 
degree for counts 1, 4, 9, and 10; charges of sexual assault in
 
the third degree for counts 2, 8, and 11; charges of
 
impersonating a law enforcement officer in the second degree for
 
counts 3, 5, and 13; attempted sexual assault in the second
 
degree for count 6; and a B felony kidnapping for count 7. 
The State filed a Motion for Sentencing of Repeat
 
Offender which sought imposition of a mandatory minimum term of
 
imprisonment of 3 years and 4 months for count 1 and 1 year and 8
 
months for count 2. An Amended Judgment was entered on July 20,
 
2005 and Carter was sentenced as follows: ten years of
 
incarceration for counts 1, 4, 6, 7, 9, and 10; five years of
 
incarceration for counts 2, 8, and 11; and one year of
 
incarceration for counts 3, 5, and 13. The terms of
 
incarceration were ordered to be served concurrently. 
On September 12, 2008, Carter filed a Petition to 
Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner 
from Custody (Rule 40 Petition). In the Rule 40 Petition, Carter 
raised fourteen issues, a number of which are raised on appeal. 
On January 5, 2009, Carter filed a Motion to Amend Petition 
Pursuant to Hawai 'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40(e) 
and withdrew his allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel. 
The State opposed the Rule 40 Petition on January 9,
 
2009. On March 16, 2009, Carter filed a motion to amend the Rule
 
40 Petition to include an allegation that the prosecuting
 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
attorney presented false DNA evidence to the Hawai 'i Paroling 
Authority and the Circuit Court. 
On May 6, 2009, the Circuit Court denied the Rule 40
 
Petition without a hearing. Carter filed a notice of appeal on
 
May 28, 2009. 
On appeal, Carter raises the following issues:
 1. Whether the prosecuting attorney and Detective Kim
 
committed perjury before the grand jury;
 
2. Whether the Circuit Court denied Carter his right
 
to due process and a fair and impartial grand jury by allowing
 Detective Kim to testify regarding statements made by RC;
 
3. Whether Detective Kim's false testimony was
 
material;
 
4. Whether RC was unavailable to testify before the
 
grand jury;
 
5. Whether the prosecuting attorney withheld clearly
 
exculpatory evidence from the grand jury;
 
6. Whether the prosecuting attorney committed
 
misconduct in the presentation to the grand jury;
 
7. Whether Carter's plea was voluntary in light of
 
the errors in the grand jury proceedings;
 
8. Whether Carter was denied the effective assistance
 
of counsel;
 
9. Whether Carter was entitled to a hearing on his
 
Rule 40 Petition; and
 
10. Whether the Rule 40 Petition was patently
 
frivolous and without a trace of support.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Carter's point of error as follows:
 
It appears that: (1) Carter waived the issues he now
 
seeks to raise on appeal and therefore the Circuit Court did not
 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
err in denying the Rule 40 Petition without a hearing; and (2)
 
the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in denying
 
Carter's request to withdraw his guilty plea.
 
Issues 1-6 raised by Carter on appeal relate to the 
evidence presented to the grand jury. These claims of 
nonjurisdictional errors in the grand jury proceedings were 
waived by Carter's guilty plea. The general rule, which is 
applicable here, is that a guilty plea bars all claims of error 
in the proceedings other than jurisdictional defects. See 
State v. Morin, 71 Haw. 159, 162, 785 P.2d 1316, 1318 (1990); Tomomitsu v. State, 93 Hawai
'i 22, 995 P.2d 323 (App. 2000). 
Nor do Carter's claim of errors in the grand jury
 
proceedings justify a withdrawal of Carter's plea. The guilty
 
plea form executed by Carter in open court on April 25, 2005
 
reflects a knowing and voluntary plea of guilty accompanied by
 
admissions of fact supporting his conviction. The guilty plea
 
form reflects Carter's understanding of the possible penalties he
 
faced including the maximum terms and the possible mandatory
 
minimum terms. In addition, the transcript of the April 25, 2005
 
hearing, which was attached as an exhibit to the State's answer
 
to the Rule 40 petition, supports the conclusion that Carter
 
knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily entered guilty pleas to
 
the charges.
 
A guilty plea may be withdrawn after the imposition of 
sentence only if it "is necessary to correct manifest injustice." 
HRPP Rule 32(d). Manifest injustice exists when the plea is 
either involuntary, was made without a full understanding of its 
direct consequences, or there has been a breach of a plea 
agreement. "Manifest injustice occurs when a defendant makes a 
plea involuntarily or without knowledge of the direct 
consequences of the plea." State v. Nguyen, 81 Hawai 'i 279, 292, 
916 P.2d 689, 702 (1996); Barnett v. State, 91 Hawai 'i 20, 28, 
979 P.2d 1046, 1054 (1999). In State v. Adams, 76 Hawai 'i 408, 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
879 P.2d 513 (1994), the Hawai 'i Supreme Court also found 
manifest injustice where the State failed to uphold its end of a 
plea bargain. Id. at 414, 879 P.2d at 519. In the absence of 
any evidence that the plea was involuntary, that Carter did not know the direct consequences of his plea, or that the State 
breached the plea agreement, the Circuit Court did not abuse its 
discretion in denying Carter's challenge to the voluntariness of 
the guilty plea. 
Carter expressly waived the claim of ineffective
 
assistance of counsel. Relief under HRPP Rule 40 is not
 
available for issues that have been waived. "Rule 40 proceedings
 
shall not be available and relief thereunder shall not be granted
 
where the issues sought to be raised have been previously ruled
 
upon or were waived." HRPP Rule 40(a)(3). 
As part of his claim of ineffective assistance of 
counsel on appeal, Carter refers to a partial document in which 
the prosecuting attorney, in reference to the offense against JA, 
stated that "Defendant denied committing the offense despite the 
fact that his DNA was found in a condom left at the scene." 
Carter also attached a letter from the Department of the Attorney 
General which stated: "We are only aware of the DNA sample given 
on February 24, 2004." Carter first raised an issue regarding 
the DNA sample in his March 16, 2009 motion to amend his Rule 40 
Petition, in which he stated that the prosecuting attorney 
presented false DNA evidence to the Hawai
'i Paroling Authority 
and the Circuit Court. Carter did not attach any exhibits to the motion to amend or explain the basis for his allegation that the 
prosecuting attorney used false DNA evidence. HRPP Rule 40(c)(1) 
requires a petition for relief under the rule to contain "in 
summary form the facts supporting each of the grounds thus 
specified." Carter failed to present to the Circuit Court any 
facts to support his claim of falsified DNA evidence. 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Even if the prosecuting attorney was mistaken about the
 
DNA evidence, Carter fails to explain how he might have been
 
prejudiced by the mistake or misstatement in light of his
 
admission that he committed acts constituting the offense charged
 
in count 4. Absent some showing of prejudice, Carter has failed
 
to demonstrate that he is entitled to relief from judgment. "No
 
order, judgment, or sentence shall be reversed or modified unless
 
the court is of the opinion that error was committed which
 
injuriously affected the substantial rights of the appellant." 
HRS § 641-16 (1993). 
In the absence of manifest injustice requiring the 
withdrawal of the guilty plea, and in light of the waiver of 
claims relating to the grand jury proceedings and ineffective 
assistance of counsel, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not 
err in concluding that the Rule 40 Petition failed to state a 
colorable claim and/or in denying the Rule 40 Petition without a 
hearing. See Dan v. State, 76 Hawai 'i 423, 427, 879 P.2d 528, 
532 (1994). 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's May 6, 2009
 
Order Denying Post-Conviction Relief is affirmed.
