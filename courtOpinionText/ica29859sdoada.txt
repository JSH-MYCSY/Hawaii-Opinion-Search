OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
WILLARD M. IMAMOTO, Plaintiff-Appellant
v.
 
HAWAII STATE HOSPITAL, DR. JULIE TRIHN,
RUPERT GOETZ, CHIYOMI FUKINO, JAMIE ROMAN,

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CV. NO. 08-1-0823)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Willard Max Imamoto (Imamoto),
 
proceeding pro se, appeals from the May 22, 2009, Judgment filed
 
in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court)1
 
against Imamoto and in favor of Defendants-Appellees Julie Trihn,
 M.D. (Dr. Trihn), Chiyomi Fukino, M.D. (Dr. Fukino), Dudley Akama (Akama), Jamie Roman (Roman), Hawai' i State Hospital (HSH), and 
Rupert Goetz (Goetz). The Circuit Court's Judgment was based on (1) its order granting Akama's and Roman's motion for summary
 judgment, (2) its order granting Dr. Trihn's and Dr. Fukino's
 motion for summary judgment and denying Imamoto's motion for
 summary judgment, and (3) the parties' stipulation to dismiss
 Imamoto's claims against HSH and Goetz with prejudice.

On appeal, Imamoto asserts numerous points of error
 
which stem from his basic claims that the Circuit Court erred in:
 
(1) granting summary judgment in favor of Akama and Roman; and
 (2) granting summary judgment in favor of Dr. Trihn and Dr.
 Fukino. We affirm the Circuit Court's grant of summary judgment
 in favor of Akama, Roman, Dr. Trihn, and Dr. Fukino. 
We conclude that the Circuit Court did not err in 
granting summary judgment in favor of Akama, Roman, Dr. Trihn, and Dr. Fukino because Imamoto's claims were barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel or issue preclusion. See 
Dorrance v. Lee, 90 Hawai' i 143, 148-49, 976 P.2d 904, 909-10 
(1999); Exotics Hawai' i-Kona, Inc. v. E.I. Dupont De Nemours & 
Co., 104 Hawai' i 358, 364-65, 90 P.3d 250, 256-57 (2004); Kulak 
v. City of New York, 88 F.3d 63, 71-73 (2d Cir. 1996). In light
 of this conclusion, we need not address the alternative argument
 raised by Akama, Roman, Dr. Trihn, and Dr. Fukino that the
 Circuit Court's grant of summary judgment in their favor was also
 warranted because Imamoto's claims were barred by the statute of
 limitations. 
We affirm the May 22, 2009, Judgment of the Circuit 
Court.
