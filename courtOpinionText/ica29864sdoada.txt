  The Honorable Kelsey Kawano presided.1NO. 29864
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
KEVIN WRIGHT, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
WAILUKU DIVISION
(Case Nos. 0893497MM & 0894033MM)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Kevin Wright (Wright) appeals the
Judgments, entered on May 6, 2009, in the District Court of the
Second Circuit, Wailuku Division (district court) in Case Nos.
0893497MM and 0894033MM.1
Wright entered conditional guilty pleas and was
convicted of Driving Without a License, in violation of Hawaii
Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 286-102 (2007) and No No-Fault
Insurance, in violation of HRS ยง 431:10G-102 (2005).
On appeal, Wright contends that the district court
erred by denying his motion, made pursuant to Rule 9 of the
Hawai#i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP), to dismiss the charges
for failure to serve an arrest warrant without "unnecessary
delay," and violation of his due process rights under the United
States and Hawai #i Constitutions.
The State agrees that the district court abused its
discretion by not dismissing the charges in violation of HRPP
Rule 9.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Wright's points of error as follows:NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2The State failed to show that the warrant was served
without unnecessary delay, pursuant to HRPP Rule 9.  State v.
Owens, 116 Hawai #i 172, 178-79, 172 P.3d 484, 489-90 (2007);
State v. Mageo, 78 Hawai# i 33, 37-38, 889 P.2d 1092, 1096-97
(App. 1995).  Because the district court abused its discretion by
not dismissing the charges against Wright for the State's failure
to comply with HRPP Rule 9, we need not address Wright's claim
that his due process rights were violated.
Therefore, 
The Judgments, entered on May 6, 2009, in the District
Court of the Second Circuit, Wailuku Division in Case Nos.
0893497MM and 0894033MM are reversed.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, April 9, 2010.
