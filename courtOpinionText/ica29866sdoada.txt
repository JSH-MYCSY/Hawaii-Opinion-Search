IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI» I 
STATE OF HAWAI» I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
KAINOA PALANI KIM, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CRIMINAL NO. 02-1-0635(2))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Kainoa Kim (Kim) appeals from the
 
Order of Resentencing/Revocation of Probation (
Revocation Order)
 
entered by the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (Circuit
 
Court) on May 7, 2009.1 On appeal, Kim contends that the Circuit
Court erred by admitting hearsay evidence at his probation
 
revocation hearing in violation of his constitutional rights of
 
confrontation and due process. He also argues that the written
 
notice of his alleged probation violations did not meet the
 
minimum requirements of due process.
  
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Kim's point of error as follows:

Kim's probation was revoked based solely on the 
testimony of his Maui Drug Court Case Manager who, without any 
personal knowledge or investigation of the matter, related the 
details of a Maui County Correctional Center (MCCC) incident 
report to the court. As the State has acknowledged on appeal, a 
defendant has a due process right to confront adverse witnesses 
in a revocation hearing and, absent good cause shown by the 
State, a parolee has a right to confront and/or cross-examine the 
witnesses against him. See , e.g., State v. Quelnan, 70 Haw. 194, 
199-200, 767 P.2d 243, 246-47 (1989); Ringor v. State, 88 Hawai» i 
229, 236, 965 P.2d 162, 169 (App. 1998); Morrissey v. Brewer , 408 
U.S. 471, 483-84 (1972). Here, the circuit court permitted the
 
Case Manager's hearsay testimony, over Kim's objection, without
 
any showing of good cause. There was no other evidence presented
 
in support of revocation of Kim's probation.
 
Accordingly, we vacate the Circuit Court's May 7, 2009 
Revocation Order and remand for further proceedings.2
