IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
EMERSON M.F. JOU, M.D., Provider-Appellant, v.
J.P. SCHMIDT, Insurance Commissioner, Department of Commerce
and Consumer Affairs, State of Hawai' i, Appellee-Appellee, v.
DAI-TOKYO ROYAL INSURANCE COMPANY, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 05-1-1053)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Provider-Appellant Emerson M.F. Jou, M.D. (Jou) appeals
 
from the Circuit Court of the First Circuit's (Circuit Court's)
 
Final Judgment On Remand, filed on May 19, 2009.1
 
Jou states his points of error on this appeal as
 
follows:
 
1. The Circuit Court, to help exculpate or release
DTRIC from liability to pay claims filed with DTRIC in
1995/1996 refused to conform or modify its prior orders or
judgment to the ICA's decision that DTRIC violated HRS
§ 431:10C-304(3)(B).
 
2. [The] Circuit Court reversibly refused to base its
determination on the time that the physician filed his claim
with DTRIC. Instead, the Circuit Court based its decision
on the event of benefit exhaustion occurring about three
years after the claims were filed.
 
3. On remand, the Court was required to modify its
earlier decision and to determine fees and costs, and
erroneously/reversibly refused.

4. The Circuit Court reversibly failed to reconsider
its ruling to reflect the ICA's conclusion regarding DTRIC's
statutory violation; or, to make clear that at the time Dr.
Jou filed his claims with DTRIC in 1995 and 1996 that the
 PIP benefits had not been exhausted; hence, the claims filed
with the insurer were reasonable.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Jou's contentions as follows:
 
This appeal follows Jou's appeal in Appeal No. 28106. 
In a Summary Disposition Order, entered on August 27, 2008, this
 
court affirmed the Circuit Court's judgment in the underlying
 
case, specifically including the Circuit Court's denial of Jou's
 
request for attorney's fees and costs. On this issue, we stated:
 
[A]lthough HRS § 431:10C-304(5) provides for
attorney's fees and costs, such fees and costs are only
available if they were incurred "to effect the payment of
any or all personal injury protection benefits found due
under the contract." Thus, under HRS § 431:10C-304(5), an
award of attorney's fees and costs is mandatory only if a
claimant prevails in a settlement or suit for no-fault
benefits. 
See Iaea v. TIG Ins. Co.,  104 Hawai' i 375, 380,
90 P.3d 267, 272 (App. 2004). Here, Jou did not prevail on
his claim for no-fault benefits, and HRS § 431:10C-304(5)
therefore does not support his claim for attorney's fees and
costs. 
Although not cited by Jou, we note that HRS § 431:10C­
211(a) provides discretion to a court to award attorney's
fees and costs even if the claimant is unsuccessful. 
See
 
also Iaea, 104 Hawai' i at 379-83, 90 P.3d at 271-74. Even 
assuming Jou had raised HRS § 431:10C-211(a) as the
appropriate statutory authority for his claim, Jou has
failed to present any cogent argument that the Circuit Court
abused its discretion in declining to award him fees and
costs in this case. 
(Footnote omitted.)
 
After the entry of the judgment in Appeal No. 28106,
 
Jou filed a request for an award of the attorney's fees incurred
 
in the appeal, citing HRS § 431:10C-211(a). While noting that
 
the amount of appellate fees and costs appeared to be reasonable
 
(except as noted), this court declined to award attorney's fees
 
and costs to Jou, instead remanding the request to the Circuit
 
Court. In doing so, we stated:
 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
[A]s [Jou] was not the prevailing party in this case, a
further proceeding is necessary to determine whether hisclaim was 'unreasonable, fraudulent, excessive, orfrivolous.' We recognize that an award of attorney's feesand costs is not limited to the prevailing party. Iaea v. 
TIG Ins. Co., 104 Hawai' i 375, 383, 90 P.3d 267, 274 (App.
2004) (citing Kawaihae v. Hawaiian Ins. Cos., 1 Haw. App.355, 358-59, 619 P.2d 1086, 1089-90 (1980)) (decided underthe predecessor to HRS § 431:10C-211(a)). However, thereasonableness of a claim is not as readily apparent whenthe claim is unsuccessful at both the trial level and on appeal.
In Kawaihae, this court held that 'the issue of fees
on appeal should be decided by the trial court in the
exercise of its discretion pursuant to HRS § 294-30.'
Kawaihae, 1 Haw. App. at 362, 619 P.2d at 1092. The
 rationale for remand to the trial court is equally sound
under HRS § 431:10C-211(a).
 
HRS § 431:10C-211(a) (2005) provides, in relevant part:
 
A person making a claim for personal injury protection
benefits may be allowed an award of a reasonable sum for
attorney's fees, and reasonable costs of suit in an action
brought by or against an insurer who denies all or part of a
claim for benefits under the policy, unless the court upon
judicial proceeding or the commissioner upon administrative
proceeding determines that the claim was unreasonable,
fraudulent, excessive, or frivolous. Reasonable attorney's
fees, based upon actual time expended, shall be treated
separately from the claim and be paid directly by the
insurer to the attorney.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
On remand, the Circuit Court denied Jou's request for
 
appellate attorney's fees. The Circuit Court found that Jou's
 
claim was not fraudulent, excessive or frivolous, but on the
 
issue of unreasonableness, the Circuit Court stated:
 
[T]his Court is mindful of the body of case law
holding that an insurance company has no obligation to pay
on a claim for No-fault/PIP benefits beyond the No-fault/PIP
policy limit. This Court further finds that the finding by
the Hearings Officer that the policy benefits were exhausted
as of February 3, 1999 was clear and was never challenged by
JOU. Accordingly, this Court finds JOU's arguments and his
claims that reimbursement should have been paid under the
provisions of the No-fault/PIP insurance policy of DTRIC
were unreasonable.
 
On this basis, the Circuit Court denied Jou's request
 
for an award of his appellate attorney's fees incurred in Appeal
 
No. 28106.
 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Jou's first and third points of error are wholly
 
without merit. The sole issue on remand was whether Jou's
 
request for appellate attorney's fees and costs in Appeal No.
 
28106 should be granted or denied. 
Jou's second and fourth points challenge the Circuit
 
Court's exercise of its discretion in denying an award of
 
appellate attorney's fees after finding that the appellate
 
attorney's fees were not reasonably incurred because, in 2005 –
 
long before the appeal was taken in No. 28106, an administrative
 
hearings officer found that the subject No-fault/Personal Injury
 
Protection (PIP) benefits were exhausted on February 3, 1999, Jou
 
never challenged that finding in his appeal to the Circuit Court,
 
and, therefore, further fees incurred in pursuing PIP benefits on
 
appeal from the Circuit Court to this court were not reasonably
 
incurred.
 
We conclude that the Circuit Court did not abuse its
 
discretion in denying appellate attorney's fees and costs. We
 
reject Jou's contention that the only proper consideration is
 
whether the claim was "unreasonable" when the claim was first
 
instituted. While that is certainly a proper consideration, it
 
was also appropriate for the court to consider, when reviewing a
 
request for appellate fees, whether it was reasonable to continue
 
to pursue the claim through a secondary appeal, even though the
 
PIP benefits had long been exhausted and the claimant had, in
 
effect, conceded that the benefits were exhausted. Cf. Kawaihae,
 
1 Haw. App. at 362, 619 P.2d at 1092 ("the fact that appellee has
 been awarded attorney's fees incurred with respect to the trial
 
does not require that she be awarded attorney's fees incurred
 
with respect to the appeal"; "the issue of fees on appeal should
 
be decided by the trial court in exercise of its discretion").
 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Jou makes further arguments that his appeal in No. 
28106 was not completely meritless, in particular noting that 
this court agreed with Jou that the DCCA and the Circuit Court 
erred in finding that DTRIC was not required to issue a formal 
notice of denial of benefits pursuant to HRS § 431:10C-304(3)(B) 
after it made both reduced and partial payments on Jou's claims. 
However, DTRIC's failure to give the statutory notice merely 
exposed the insurer to potential civil penalties pursuant to HRS 
§ 431:10C-117(b) and (c); it did not provide a remedy to Jou on 
appeal. Jou v. Schmidt, 117 Hawai' i 502, 505 n.6, 184 P.3d 817, 
820 n.6 (App. 2008). Jou's further arguments do not support a conclusion that the Circuit Court abused its discretion in 
denying Jou's appellate attorney's fees. 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's May 19, 2009
 
Judgment on Remand is affirmed.
