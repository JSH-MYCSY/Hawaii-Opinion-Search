STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent-Appellee

SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Regina Smith (Smith) appeals the
 
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying Petition
 
for Post-Conviction Relief, filed on April 29, 2009 (Order
 
Denying Post-Conviction Relief) in the Circuit Court of the First
 Circuit (Circuit Court).

On September 29, 1993, Smith was found guilty of five 
counts of Sexual Assault in the First Degree and six counts of 
Sexual Assault in the Third Degree. Smith was sentenced to an 
extended term of imprisonment.  On January 13, 1997, Smith's 
convictions were affirmed by the Supreme Court of Hawai 'i. 
On April 1, 1998, Smith filed a petition for post-
conviction relief (First Petition) (S.P.P. No. 98-0027) pursuant 
to Hawai 'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40. The First 
Petition was denied. 
On July 3, 2002, Smith filed another petition for post-
conviction relief (Second Petition) (S.P.P. No. 02-1-0051) pursuant to HRPP Rule 40. The Second Petition was also denied. 
On February 3, 2004, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i affirmed the 
denial of the Second Petition in Appeal No. 25724.

On November 12, 2008, Smith filed a "memorandum" in
 
support of petition for post-conviction relief, which was
 
designated as a non-conforming petition for post-conviction
 
relief, in S.P.P. 08-1-0047. On January 6, 2009, Smith filed a
 
Petition for Post-Conviction Relief (Third Petition), pursuant to
 
HRPP Rule 40 in S.P.P. 09-1-0001. On February 3, 2009, the
 
Circuit Court ordered that all documents in S.P.P. 08-1-0047 be
 
transferred to S.P.P. 09-1-0001 and that S.P.P. 08-1-0047 be
 
dismissed. 
In the Third Petition, Smith stated that "petitioner is
 
not attempting to claim that Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466
 
(2000), or any of its progeny, should be applied retroactively." 
Smith claimed that her extended sentence, imposed pursuant to
 
Hawaii Revised Statute ยง 706-662 was unconstitutional on its
 
face, and therefore, void ab initio. On April 29, 2009, the
 
Circuit Court entered the Order Denying Post-Conviction Relief,
 
which denied Smith's Third Petition.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Smith's point of error as follows:
 
Smith's sentence to an extended term of imprisonment 
was not void ab initio. See State v. Jess, 117 Hawai 'i 381, 184 
P.3d 133 (2008); Loher v. State, 118 Hawai 'i 522, 193 P.3d 438 
(App. 2008); and State v. Cutsinger, 118 Hawai 'i 68, 81, 185 P.3d 
816, 829 (App. 2008), overruled in part on other grounds by State v. Jess, 117 Hawai
'i 381, 184 P.3d 133 (2008).
