APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Defendants/Counterclaim-Plaintiffs/Cross-Claim
 
Defendants/Appellants Glenn Nobuki Murakami and Ann Sue Isobe
 
(collectively, Appellants) appeal from the Order Denying Glenn
 
Nobuki Murakami and Ann Sue Isobe's Motion (1) to Disqualify the
 
Honorable Eden Elizabeth Hifo, (2) for a Protective Order, (3) to
 
Set Aside July 28, 2008, Final Judgment and to Expunge All
 
Notices of Pendency of Action Related Thereto, and (4) to Quash
 
All Post-Judgment Garnishment Orders, Writs of Execution, and
 
Debtors' Examination Orders in this Case (Order Denying
 
Disqualification), entered by the Circuit Court of the First
 Circuit (Circuit Court) on May 5, 2009.

The issue on appeal is whether Judge Hifo erred in
 
failing to recuse herself and entering the Order Denying
 
Disqualification.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve
 
Appellants' contentions as follows:
 
With their motion to disqualify, Appellants submitted a 
declaration of counsel and a "Concurring Declaration of Clients" 
signed by Appellant Murakami. An affidavit or declaration of 
counsel does not satisfy the statutory requirement for the party 
seeking disqualification to attest to the disqualifying facts. 
See Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 601-7 (1993 & Supp. 2010); 
Jou v. Schmidt, 117 Hawai' i 477, 483, 184 P.3d 792, 798 (App. 
2008). The only factual assertion set forth in the concurring 
2
declaration  is that for the reasons set forth by counsel, "Ms.
Isobe and I also affirm that we do not believe that we can get a
 
fair hearing before the Honorable Eden Elizabeth Hifo in the
 
1
 The Honorable Eden Elizabeth Hifo presided.
 
2
 We need not address the propriety of Appellant Murakami's attempt
to disqualify Judge Hifo based, in part, on his declaration of his co-party's
beliefs and feelings.
 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
above-referenced matters and for this Motion, which Judge has
 
demonstrated a personal bias and prejudice against us, and we
 
also feel that she has fostered an appearance of impropriety
 
against us at the very least requiring her immediate
 
disqualification from this case." A conclusory statement of
 
beliefs and feelings is legally insufficient to require
 
disqualification.
 
HRS § 601-7 requires a moving party to timely file an 
affidavit "stat[ing] the facts and reasons for the belief that 
bias or prejudice exists." State v. Ross, 89 Hawai' i 371, 377, 
974 P.2d 11, 17 (1998). Specifically, the facts set forth in the affidavit must be sufficient for a "sane and reasonable mind" to 
"fairly infer bias or prejudice." James W. Glover, Ltd. v. Fong, 
39 Haw. 308, 314-15 (1952). Even if we consider the assertions 
in counsel's declaration to be incorporated into the concurring 
declaration, the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in 
determining that the statutory requirements were not met. There 
are no alleged facts demonstrating personal bias on the part of 
the Circuit Court, other than the bare fact that adverse and 
allegedly erroneous rulings were made in connection with post-
judgment collection-related proceedings. Adverse and allegedly 
erroneous rulings are not a basis for disqualification. See 
Ross, 89 Hawai' i at 377-78, 974 P.2d at 17-18.

For these reasons, the Circuit Court's May 5, 2009
 
Order Denying Disqualification is affirmed.
