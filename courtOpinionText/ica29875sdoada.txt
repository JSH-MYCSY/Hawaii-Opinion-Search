vs.
VINCENT M. YOSHIOKA, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
HONOLULU DIVISION
(CASE NO. 1DTC-08-046549)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley, and Fujise, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Vincent M. Yoshioka (Yoshioka)
appeals from the Judgment filed on May 8, 2009, in the District
Court of the First Circuit (district court).1/  Yoshioka was
convicted of the offense of excessive speeding, in violation of
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 291C-105(a)(1) (2007 & Supp.
2009).  
Yoshioka's conviction was predicated on a police
officer's testimony regarding the speed reading from a laser gun
used by the officer to measure the speed of Yoshioka's vehicle. 
Yoshioka objected to the officer's testimony regarding the laser
gun's speed reading on the grounds of lack of foundation and
improper expert testimony.  The district court overruled the
objections and permitted the officer to testify about the speed
reading he obtained from the laser gun. 
On appeal, Yoshioka argues that (1) the district court
erred in denying in part a motion to compel discovery; and (2)
the district court erred in convicting Yoshioka because an
inadequate foundation was laid to support the admission of the
speed reading from the laser gun.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai# i (State) concedes
that (1) under State v. Assaye, 121 Hawai #i 204, 216 P.3d 1227
(2009), an insufficient foundation was laid to support the
admission of the laser gun's speed reading and (2) without that
evidence, there was insufficient evidence to convict Yoshioka. 
We agree that Assaye is dispositive.  Under Assaye, the district
court erred in admitting the officer's testimony regarding the
laser gun's speed reading.  Without that testimony, there was
insufficient evidence to convict Yoshioka.  Accordingly, we
reverse Yoshioka's conviction, which makes it unnecessary for us
to address Yoshioka's discovery claim.
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment filed on May 8,
2009, in the district court is reversed.
