v.
 
JAMES CARVALHO APO, also known as,
"ESTRADA", Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT

 
(CRIMINAL NO. 07-1-0408(3))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER

 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant James Carvalho Apo (Apo) appeals
 
from the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence entered on May 7,
 
2009 in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (circuit court).1
 
Apo was convicted of Kidnapping, in violation of section 707­720(1)(d), Hawaii Revised Statutes (1993) (Section 707­720(1)(d)), and Sexual Assault in the Third Degree in violation
 of section 707-732(1)(f), Hawaii Revised Statutes (Supp. 2008),
 as a young adult defendant under section 706-667, Hawaii Revised
 Statutes (Supp. 2009). 
Apo was sentenced to eight years in prison for the
 
Kidnapping conviction and four years in prison for the Sex
 Assault in the Third Degree conviction, with the terms to run
 concurrently, and with credit for time served. In addition, Apo
 was ordered to pay restitution of $883.78, and $910.00 for fees
 and costs. 
On appeal, Apo argues that: 
(1) there was insufficient evidence to support a
 
conviction for a class A felony under Section 707-720(1)(d)
 because the evidence established that Apo voluntarily released
 the complaining witness (CW), requiring a reduction of the
 offense to a class B felony under section 707-720(3), Hawaii
 Revised Statutes (1993); and 
1/

       NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2) it was erroneous for the circuit court to conclude
 
that Kidnapping and Sexual Assault in the Third Degree did not
 
merge under section 701-109(1)(e), Hawaii Revised Statutes (1993)
 (Section 701-109(1)(e)). 
We find both points to be without merit and affirm.
 
I.	 There Was Substantial Evidence For The Circuit Court To Find
 
Apo Guilty Of A Class A Felony For Kidnapping
 
Apo contends that the circuit court should not have
 
found him guilty of a class A felony under Section 707-720(1)(d)
 
because substantial evidence demonstrated that he released the CW
 voluntarily before a witness to the attack (Witness) commanded
 him to get off of the CW. Kidnapping under Section 707-720(1)(d)
 is reduced from a class A felony to a class B felony if the
 defendant voluntarily released the victim, alive and not
 suffering from serious or substantial bodily injury, in a safe
 place prior to trial.
2 HAW. REV. STAT. § 707-720(3).
 
Apo argues that because he voluntarily released the CW 
before the Witness confronted them, Findings of Fact (FOF) 19-21 and Conclusions of Law (COL) 7-9 are clearly erroneous. We review FOF under the clearly erroneous standard of review, while COL are reviewed de novo. Dan v. State, 76 Hawai
'i 423, 428, 879 
P.2d 528, 533 (1994). 
Apo contends that the record shows that CW testified
 
that her struggle with Apo had ended when she removed her
 earphones before Witness confronted them, that Witness's
 testimony "merely implied that Apo released CW because Witness
 told him to 'get off of the girl,'" and that Witness's testimony
 "reveal[s] disparities between [his] assumptions, and what he
 actually saw[.]" 
Our review of the record, however, reveals substantial
 
evidence to support the circuit court's finding that the State
 had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Apo did not voluntarily
 release the CW to a point of safety before being ordered to do

 For someone convicted as a Young Adult Defendant, the maximum
sentence is 8 years for a Class A felony, and 5 years for a Class B felony.

so. A release is not voluntary when the kidnapper releases the 
victim after being ordered to do so under threat by a third party. State v. Yamamoto, 98 Hawai
'i 208, 220, 46 P.3d 1092, 
1104 (App. 2002). Moreover, a victim has not been released to a safe place when the kidnapper is still close enough to the victim that he or she still poses a threat. State v. Mara, 102 Hawai
'i 
346, 355, 76 P.3d 589, 598 (App. 2003). 
Apo gave conflicting accounts of the incident. In his
 
initial post-arrest interview, he admitted to intentionally
 tackling and restraining the CW, but claimed that his intention
 had only been to hold her and touch her.
3 When Apo testified at
 
trial, however, he claimed that CW had fallen backward in
 surprise, that he had only meant to "check [CW] out," and that he
 had only dragged CW off of the road to get her out of harm's way. 
Witness testified that he pulled his truck up to within
 
seven to ten feet of Apo and CW, and saw Apo "straddling on top
 of [CW]" as he got out of the truck. Witness also testified that
 he told Apo to "[g]et off the girl[,]" and that Apo "got up
 slightly" as Witness approached, but "still had a knee on top of
 [CW]." When Witness got closer, Apo "stood up more in a standup
 position." 
CW's testimony acknowledges that Witness was present in
 
the area when she stood up. While she did not testify to hearing
 Witness yell at Apo before Apo released her, her testimony is
 largely consistent with Witness's testimony, and supports the
 circuit court's evident conclusion that her headphones were on at
 the time that Witness directed Apo to "[g]et off the girl." 
Based on our review of the testimony and the record, we
 
conclude that there was substantial evidence to support FOF 19-21
 and COL 9-11. 
II.	 The Circuit Court Did Not Err In Concluding That Sexual
Assault And Kidnapping Do Not Merge
 
Apo contends that it was error for the circuit court to
 
conclude that the charged offenses of Kidnapping and Sexual

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Assault did not merge under Section 701-109(1)(e). A defendant
 
may not be convicted of more than one offense if "[t]he offense
 is defined as a continuing course of conduct and the defendant's
 course of conduct was uninterrupted, unless the law provides that
 specific periods of conduct constitute separate offenses." H
AW.
 
REV. STAT. § 701-109(1)(e). 
Apo asserts that the circuit court erroneously relied 
on State v. Molitoni, 6 Haw. App. 77, 711 P.2d 1303 (1985) in arriving at COL 18 because that case interprets the distinctly different merger defense set out in section 701-109(1)(a), Hawaii Revised Statutes (Section 701-109(1)(a)).
4 Citing State v. 
Padilla, Apo argues that the circuit court also erred by failing to adopt specific findings or conclusions demonstrating that the court applied the merger doctrine, and in failing to analyze whether there was but "one intention, one general impulse, and one plan," or not. 114 Hawai
'i 507, 517, 164 P.3d 765, 775 (App. 
2007). 
While apparently conceding that Kidnapping is not an
 
included offense of Sexual Assault under Section 701-109(1)(a),
 Apo argues that his merger claim arises under Section 701­109(1)(e), which, he contends, is "distinctly different from the
 included-offense-analysis" in Molitoni, State v. Horswill, 75
 Haw. 152, 857 P.2d 579 (1993), State v. Hoopii, 68 Haw. 246, 710
 P.2d 1193 (1985), and State v. Decenso, 5 Haw. App. 127, 681 P.2d
 573 (1984). According to Apo, Molitoni's included offense
 analysis under Section 701-109(1)(a) is distinctly different from
 the continuing course of uninterrupted conduct analysis under
 Section 701-109(1)(e), and cannot support a conclusion of no
 merger. The court's analytical error, according to Apo, was
 compounded by its failure to make any specific findings or
 conclusions demonstrating that the court properly applied the
 merger doctrine. As a result, Apo contends that his conviction
 for both offenses violated his due process right to a fair trial
 and the double jeopardy clause. We disagree. 
4/
 In raising his merger defense to the circuit court, Apo explicitly
referenced Section 701-109(1)(a), while never referencing Section 701­
109(1)(e).

The section in question provides:
 
(1) When the same conduct of a defendant may establish an element
of more than one offense, the defendant may be prosecuted for each
offense of which such conduct is an element. The defendant may
not, however, be convicted of more than one offense if: 
. . . . 
(e) The offense is defined as a continuing course of conduct and
the defendant's course of conduct was uninterrupted, unless the
law provides that specific periods of conduct constitute separate
offenses.
 
HAW. REV. STAT. § 701-109(1)(e).
 
Section 701-109(1)(e) "does not apply where a
 
[defendant's] actions constitute separate offenses under the
 
law." Hoopii, 68 Haw. at 251, 710 P.2d at 1197. In Hoopii, the
 
supreme court held that the appellant had committed and completed
 the act of Kidnapping at the moment he restrained the victim by
 abducting her, putting her in his van, and driving away. Any
 restraint that continued throughout the subsequent rape, the
 supreme court further held, was not necessary to the perpetration
 of the Kidnapping. Id. 
Here, as in Hoopii, Sexual Assault and Kidnapping are
 
separate crimes. Apo completed the crime of Kidnapping when he
 restrained CW and dragged her behind the rock wall. He completed
 the crime of Sexual Assault when he grabbed CW's genital area. 
Apo also had different intentions behind each crime. He grabbed
 CW's genital area in order to make sexual contact. He dragged
 her behind the rock wall because he did not want to be seen by
 passers by. 
Apo's conviction does not violate the double jeopardy 
clauses of the United States or Hawai
'i State Constitutions. 
U.S. Const. amend. V; Haw. Const. art. I, § 10 ("nor shall any
 person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in
 jeopardy"). "If two different offenses are charged and each
 involves different acts, they are not the 'same offense' and do
 not implicate the constitutional prohibition against double
 jeopardy." Decenso, 5 Haw. App. at 135, 681 P.2d at 580. 
In Decenso, this court held that it was not double
 
jeopardy for the defendant to be tried for Kidnapping and Sexual
 Abuse because each crime involved different acts. Id. Here, as

in Decenso, Kidnapping and Sexual Assault involve different acts. 
As such, Apo's conviction for both crimes did not violate double
 jeopardy. 
III. Conclusion
 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the May 7, 2009
 
Judgment of Conviction and Sentence finding Apo guilty of
 
Kidnapping and Sexual Assault in the Third Degree.
