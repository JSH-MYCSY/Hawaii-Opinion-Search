NO. 29877
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
IN THE MATTER OF RICHARD BLAISDELL
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

 
(CIVIL NO. 08-1-0958)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER

 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant pro se Richard Blaisdell
 
(Blaisdell) appeals from the Final Separate Judgment filed on
 
1
May 14, 2009 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit  (circuit
court).
 
Blaisdell is a Hawai 'i state inmate incarcerated in 
Arizona. He filed a "Motion for Court to Order Saguaro Prison 
Officials to Supply Information, Request for Court to Enjoin 
Prison Officials to Give Blaisdell His Legal Material Forthwith, 
T.R.O. and/or P.I." in circuit court that the court appears to
 
have interpreted as constituting a civil complaint asserting
 
causes of action under the Freedom of Information Act. Blaisdell
 
alleged that prison officials were denying him access to certain

information and moved the circuit court for a temporary
 
restraining order and/or preliminary injunction that would enjoin
 
prison officials from destroying tape cassettes that prison
 
officials allegedly confiscated from Blaisdell. He prayed for
 
injunctive relief and monetary damages.
 
Blaisdell did not serve his complaint on anyone nor did
 
he specifically name any defendants.
 
On May 15, 2008, the circuit court denied Blaisdell's
 
motion.
 
On August 1, 2008, Blaisdell filed an "Emergency Motion
 
for a T.R.O and/or Preliminary Injunction," asking the circuit
 
court to enjoin Saguaro Prison officials from destroying
 
Blaisdell's tape cassettes. On October 21, 2008, the circuit
 
court denied Blaisdell's motion.
 
On November 13, 2008, Blaisdell filed a notice of 
appeal from the October 21, 2008 order. The appellate court 
clerk assigned appellate No. 29465 to the appeal. On March 4, 
2009, this court dismissed appeal No. 29465 because the circuit 
court had not entered an appealable judgment, as required under 
Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 641-1(a) and (c) (1993 & Supp. 2007), 
Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 58, and the holding in 
Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai 'i 115, 119, 
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
On May 14, 2009, the circuit court entered the Final
 
Separate Judgment, in which the court denied Blaidell's "requests
 
for a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction"
 
with prejudice; entered judgment against Blaisdell and in favor
 
of persons who the circuit court perceived as being the
 
"defendants" in this case; and expressly dismissed all other
 
claims.
 
On June 5, 2009, Blaisdell filed a notice of appeal
 
from the Final Separate Judgment.

Upon careful review of the record and the brief
 
submitted by Blaisdell and having given due consideration to the
 
arguments advanced and the issues raised by him, as well as the
 
relevant statutory and case law, we conclude that Blaisdell's
 
appeal is without merit. 
Therefore,
 The Final Separate Judgment filed on May 14, 2009 in
 
the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
