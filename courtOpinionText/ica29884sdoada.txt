STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
RICK M. HANNA, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
HONOLULU DIVISION
(Case No. 1DTA-08-10078)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Rick M. Hanna (Hanna) appeals the
judgment, entered on May 19, 2009, in the District Court of the
First Circuit, Honolulu Division (district court).1
Hanna was convicted of Operating a Vehicle Under the
Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii
Revised Statutes ยง 291E-61(a) and (b) (Supp. 2009)
On appeal, Hanna contends that the district court erred
by denying his Motion to Dismiss the charge because the written
complaint and oral charge for OVUII failed to state an essential
element of the offense, i.e., that Hanna operated or assumed
actual physical control of a vehicle upon a public way, street,
road, or highway.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Hanna's point of error as follows:
(1)  "[T]he operation of a vehicle on a public way,
street, road, or highway is an attendant circumstance of the
offense of OVUII, and is therefore an element of the offense." 
State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai# i 383, 393, 219 P.3d 1170, 1180
(2009).  The failure to allege that Hanna was driving a vehicleNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2upon a public way, street, road, or highway at the time of the
offense rendered the charge deficient.  Id.  Therefore, the
charge must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the judgment, entered on
May 19, 2009, in the District Court of the First Circuit,
Honolulu Division is vacated.  The matter is remanded to the
district court with instructions to dismiss the OVUII charge
without prejudice.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, May 17, 2010.
