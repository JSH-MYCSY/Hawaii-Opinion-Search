ARIC P. LARSEN, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
HONOLULU DIVISION
(CASE NO. 1DTA-08-09599)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Aric P. Larsen ( ) appeals
from the Judgment entered against him on May 21, 2009, in the
District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division ( District
Court).1  Larsen was convicted of Operating a Vehicle Under the
Influence of an Intoxicant ( ),  in violation of Hawaii
Revised Statutes ยง 291E-61(a) and (b) (Supp. 2009).OVUIILarsen
On appeal, Larsen contends, inter alia,  that the
District Court erred by denying his motion to dismiss the charge
because the written complaint and oral charge for OVUII failed to
state an essential element of the offense, i.e., that Larsen
operated or assumed actual physical control of a vehicle upon a
public way, street, road, or highway.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Larsen's points of error as follows:
 "[T]he operation of a vehicle on a public way, street,
road, or highway is an attendant circumstance of the offense of
OVUII, and is therefore an element of the offense."  State v.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2Wheeler, 121 Hawai# i 383, 393, 219 P.3d 1170, 1180 (2009).  The
failure to allege that Larsen was driving a vehicle upon a public
way, street, road, or highway at the time of the offense rendered
the charge deficient.  Id.  Accordingly, the charge must be
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  We need not address Larsen's
other points of error.
Therefore, the District Court's May 21, 2009 Judgment
is vacated and this case is remanded to the District Court for
dismissal of the OVUII charge without prejudice.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, April 28, 2010.
