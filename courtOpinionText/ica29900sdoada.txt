APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.) 
Defendant/Counterclaim Plaintiff-Appellant Theresa 
Ilene Harden (Harden) appeals from the "Judgment on Order 
Approving Report of Commissioner, Confirming Commissioner's Sale 
of Property at Public Auction, and for a Writ of Possession," 
entered on June 4, 2009 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit 
(circuit court).1 
Harden contends that the circuit court erred by 
confirming the sale of 47-227 Okana Road, K ne» ohe, Hawai» i 
(Property) at public auction because (1) the sale price was unreasonable and (2) Plaintiffs/Counterclaim Defendants-Appellees

Dustin Cross and Sandi Adele Schneiderman (Plaintiffs) committed
 
fraud which is the subject of appeal No. 29576.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Harden's points of error as follows:
 
Harden fails to point where in the record she objected 
to a bid of $350,000 for the Property. Although she objected to 
a prior bid of $125,000, the bidding was reopened at the hearing 
on Plaintiffs' motion to confirm the foreclosure sale which 
resulted in an offer of $350,000 being accepted by the 
Commissioner. Harden did not object to this later, higher offer. 
Consequently, Harden's point of error that the bid of $350,000 
was unreasonable has not been preserved for appeal. Hawai» i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(4). 
Moreover, Harden's only objection made to the circuit
 
court was to the Commissioner's method of marketing the Property. 
Harden requested that the Property be further marketed based on
 
the Property being vacant land. However, Harden did not
 
previously object to the method of marketing the Property as
 
directed in the Commissioner's instructions, nor did she identify
 
in what respect the Commissioner failed to comply with his
 
instructions or present any evidence supporting her position that
 
the marketing efforts made by the Commissioner were inadequate. 
As to Harden's arguments regarding alleged illegal
 
alterations to the Property and concealment of the same,
 
referencing the arguments and allegations in appeal No. 29576,
 
our Summary Disposition Order entered on February 10, 2011 in
 
appeal No. 29576 disposes of the same.
 
The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in
 
confirming the sale of the Property in this case.
 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Judgment on Order
 
Approving Report of Commissioner, Confirming Commissioner's Sale
