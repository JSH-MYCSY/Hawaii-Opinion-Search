v.
ROBERT E. KENYON, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
HONOLULU DIVISION
(Case No. 1DTA-08-10457)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley, and Fujise, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Robert E. Kenyon (Kenyon) appeals
from the Judgment filed on May 22, 2009,1 in the District Court
of the First Circuit (district court).2
Kenyon was convicted of Operating a Vehicle Under the
Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii
Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 291E-61(a)(1) and (b)(1) (Supp. 2008). 
On appeal, Kenyon argues that the district court erred
by denying his motion to dismiss the OVUII charge because the
written complaint and oral charge failed to state an essential
element of the offense, namely, that Kenyon operated or assumed
actual physical control of a vehicle upon a public way, street,
road, or highway.3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties, we resolve Kenyon's arguments on appeal
follows:
"[T]he operation [or the assumption of actual physical
control] of a vehicle on a public way, street, road, or highway
is an attendant circumstance of the offense of OVUII, and is
therefore an element of the offense."  State v. Wheeler, 121
Hawai#i 383, 393, 219 P.3d 1170, 1180 (2009).  The OVUII charge
brought against Kenyon was insufficient because it failed to
allege that Kenyon operated or assumed actual physical control of
a vehicle upon a public way, street, road, or highway.  Id.   
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the district court's Judgment
filed on May 22, 2009, is vacated, and this case is remanded to
the district court with instructions to dismiss the OVUII charge
without prejudice.
