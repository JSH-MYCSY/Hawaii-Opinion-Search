NO. 29908
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 08-1-2667)
 
MAY 31, 2011
 
FOLEY AND FUJISE, JJ.;
NAKAMURA, C.J., CONCURRING SEPARATELY
 
In this secondary appeal of an administrative agency 
decision, Petitioner/Appellant-Appellant the Director of the 
Department of Labor and Industrial Relations (Director) appeals 
from the "Judgment on Decision and Order Affirming Hawai
'i Labor 
Relations Board's Decision No. 24, Dated November 24, 2008" filed FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
on May 28, 2009 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit1 
(circuit court). The circuit court entered judgment in favor of 
Respondent/Appellee-Appellee Permasteelisa Cladding Technologies, 
Ltd. (Permasteelisa) and Agency/Appellee-Appellee Hawai' i Labor 
Relations Board (HLRB) and against Director, pursuant to the court's May 28, 2009 "Decision and Order Affirming Hawai' i Labor 
Relations Board's Decision No. 24, Dated November 24, 2008." 
On appeal, Director contends:
 
(1) The circuit court erred in affirming HLRB's
 
conclusion that Permasteelisa complied with the standard set out
 in 29 C.F.R. § 1926.501(b)(1) (Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR)
 
Chapter 12-121.2). In connection therewith, Director contends
 
that in HLRB's "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order"
 
issued November 24, 2008, the portion of Finding of Fact (FOF) 33
 
2
stating "[t]he Board accepts Flippo's  opinion, that
[Permasteelisa] provided protection for [Frank Montayre, Jr.
 
(Montayre)] from fall hazards by providing him a functional
 
personal fall arrest system and thereby complied with 29 C.F.R.
 
§ 1926.501" is clearly erroneous and Conclusion of Law (COL) 8 is
 
wrong.
 
(2) Permasteelisa did not plead or present any
 
evidence of an affirmative defense and, therefore, cannot now
 
raise the defense to negate the violation.
 
I.
 
A. Factual Background
 
Hawaii Dredging Construction Company subcontracted with
 
Permasteelisa to design and install the exterior facade,
 
consisting of aluminum frame and glass, of the East and West
 
Towers of the Moana Pacific Condominium project (the project). 
On March 14, 2007, Montayre, an ironworker employed by
 
1
 The Honorable Eden Elizabeth Hifo presided.
 
2
 Charles Flippo was a safety compliance officer with Hawaii
Occupational Safety and Health Division who investigated Montayer's fall.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Permasteelisa, while briefly working alone, fell to his death
 
from the 46th floor of the East Tower. Montayre and his work
 
partner had just taken a fifteen-minute break on another floor. 
When Montayre left the break area, he neglected to take his
 
personal fall arrest protection equipment, even though he was
 
going to work in a condominium unit on the 46th floor that
 
required the use of a fall protection system. Not all of the
 
3
glass panels had been installed on the lanai  of the unit, which
presented a danger that a worker could fall.
 
Safety standards required a fall protection system to
 
be utilized when an employee was on a working surface "with an
 
unprotected side or edge which is 6 feet (1.8 m) or more above a
 
lower level." 
29 C.F.R. § 1926.501(b)(1). Permasteelisa had
 
4
provided Montayre with a personal fall arrest system  and
installed a claw anchor hole in the floor of the unit, into which
 
a worker could insert a retractable anchor bolt attached to his
 
personal fall arrest system. Montayre had been trained and
 
directed by Permasteelisa to use this system. The fall arrest
 
system would engage in the event a worker fell and prevent the
 
worker from falling to his death. There is nothing in the record
 
to indicate that Permasteelisa was on notice that Montayre had
 
not used or would not use the fall arrest system as trained and
 
directed by Permasteelisa.
 
B. Procedural Background
 
On August 8, 2007, the Director, through the Hawaii
 
Occupational Safety and Health Division (HIOSH), issued a
 
Citation and Notification of Penalty to Permasteelisa for
 
violations of the Hawaii Occupational Safety and Health Law,

 In Hawaiian, lanai means a porch, veranda, or balcony. Mary Kawena
Pukui & Samuel H. Elbert, Hawaiian Dictionary at 193 (1986).

 A personal fall arrest system is defined as "a system used to arrest
an employee in a fall from a working level. It consists of an anchorage,
connectors, a body belt or body harness and may include a lanyard,
deceleration device, lifeline, or suitable combinations of these." 29 C.F.R.
 § 1926.500(b)
 
3
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 396. Specifically, the
 
Director cited Permasteelisa for violations of fall protection
 
standards 29 C.F.R. § 1926.501(b)(1) (Citation 1, Item 1);
 
29 C.F.R. § 1926.502(a)(2) (Citation 1, Item 2a); 29 C.F.R.
 
§ 1926.502(b)(2) (Citation 1, Item 2b); and 29 C.F.R.
 
§ 1926.503(b)(1) (Citation 2, Item 1) -- all incorporated from
 
the federal regulations under HAR Chapter 12-121.2.1.
 
On August 31, 2007, Permasteelisa contested the
 
citations. Director forwarded the contested case to HLRB and the
 
Department of the Attorney General.
 
HLRB heard the case on February 12 and 13, 2008 and
 
issued its "Decision No. 24 Findings of Facts, Conclusions of
 
Law, and Order" on November 24, 2008. HLRB vacated Citation 1,
 
Items 1, 2a, and 2b, and affirmed Citation 2, Item 1. Director
 
filed a motion for reconsideration. On December 17, 2008, HLRB
 
denied the motion, with the exception of a correction on page 2
 
to language in the introduction of the decision.
 
On December 26, 2008, Director filed an appeal to the
 
circuit court. The circuit court, after oral argument, affirmed
 
HLRB's decision and filed a judgment on May 28, 2009. Director
 
timely appealed.

A. Secondary Appeal
 
"'Review of a decision made by a court upon its review
of an administrative decision is a secondary appeal. The 
standard of review is one in which [the appellate] courtmust determine whether the court under review was right or
wrong in its decision.'" Leslie v. Bd. of Appeals of County 
of Hawaii, 109 Hawai' i 384, 391, 126 P.3d 1071, 1078 (2006)
(quoting Lanai Co., Inc. v. Land Use Comm'n, 105 Hawai' i 
296, 306-07, 97 P.3d 372, 382-83 (2004) (other citation
omitted)). The standards as set forth in HRS § 91-14(g)
(1993) are applied to the agency's decision. Ka Pa'akai O 
Ka'aina v. Land Use Comm'n, 94 Hawai' i 31, 40, 7 P.3d 1068,
1077 (2000). HRS § 91-14(g) provides: 
(g) Upon review of the record the court may
affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case
with instructions for further proceedings; or it may
reverse or modify the decision and order if the
substantial rights of the petitioners may have been

prejudiced because the administrative findings,
conclusions, decisions, or orders are:
 
(1)	 In violation of constitutional or
 statutory provisions; or
 
(2)	 In excess of the statutory authority or
jurisdiction of the agency; or
 
(3)	 Made upon unlawful procedure; or
 
(4)	 Affected by other error of law; or
 
(5)	 Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,
probative, and substantial evidence on the
whole record; or
 
(6)	 Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized
by abuse of discretion or clearly
unwarranted exercise of discretion.
 
"'Under HRS § 91-14(g), conclusions of law are reviewableunder subsections (1), (2), and (4); questions regardingprocedural defects under subsection (3); findings of factunder subsection (5); and an agency's exercise of discretion
under subsection (6).'" Sierra Club v. Office of Planning, 
State of Hawai' i, 109 Hawai' i 411, 414, 126 P.3d 1098, 1101 
(2006) (quoting In re Hawaiian Elec. Co., 81 Hawai' i 459,
465, 918 P.2d 561, 567 (1996) (other citation omitted)). 
"'An agency's findings are not clearly erroneous and
will be upheld if supported by reliable, probative and
substantial evidence unless the reviewing court is left with
a firm and definite conviction that a mistake has been
 
made.'" Poe v. Hawai' i Labor Relations Bd., 105 Hawai' i 97, 
100, 94 P.3d 652, 655 (2004) (quoting Kilauea Neighborhood
 Ass'n v. Land Use Comm'n, 7 Haw. App. 227, 229-30, 751 P.2d
1031, 1034 (1988)). "'The courts may freely review an
agency's conclusions of law.'" Lanai Co., 105 Hawai' i at 
307, 97 P.3d at 383 (quoting Dole Hawaii Div.-Castle &
 Cooke, Inc. v. Ramil, 71 Haw. 419, 424, 794 P.2d 1115, 1118
(1990) (other citation omitted)). "Abuse is apparent when
the discretion exercised clearly exceeds the bounds of
reason or disregards rules or principles of law or practice
to the substantial detriment of a party litigant." Kimura

929, 943-44 (2007) (brackets in original omitted). 
B. Deference to Administrative Agency Decision
 
In determining whether an agency determination should
be given deference, the standard to be applied is as
follows:
 
[W]hen reviewing a determination of an administrative
agency, we first decide whether the legislature
granted the agency discretion to make the
 
5
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
determination being reviewed. If the legislature has
granted the agency discretion over a particular
matter, then we review the agency's action pursuant to
the deferential abuse of discretion standard (bearing
in mind that the legislature determines the boundaries
of that discretion). If the legislature has not
granted the agency discretion over a particular
matter, then the agency's conclusions are subject to
de novo review.
 
Paul's Electrical Service, Inc. v. Befitel, 104 Hawai' i 412,
419-20, 91 P.3d 494, 501-[02] (2004). 
Olelo: The Corp. for Cmty. Television v. Office of Info. 
Practices, 116 Hawai' i 337, 344, 173 P.3d 484, 491 (2007). 
"[I]n deference to the administrative agency's
 
expertise and experience in its particular field, the courts
 
should not substitute their own judgment for that of the
 
administrative agency where mixed questions of fact and law are
 
presented. This is particularly true where the law to be applied
 
is not a statute but an administrative rule promulgated by the
 
same agency interpreting it." Camara v. Agsalud, 67 Haw. 212,
 
216, 685 P.2d 794, 797 (1984) (citation omitted).
 
Where an administrative agency has adopted wholesale 
the relevant federal regulations into its administrative rules, Dir., Dep't of Labor & Indus. Relations v. Kiewit Pac. Co., 104 
Hawai'i 22, 34, 84 P.3d 530, 542 (App. 2004), "absent clear and 
unambiguous language in the federal regulation, a court must give deference to any reasonably acceptable interpretation by the 
federal agency or, in the absence of a federal interpretation, by 
the state agency." Yelder v. Hornsby, 666 F. Supp. 1518, 1521 
(M.D. Ala. 1987).
 
III.
 
To establish a violation of an occupational safety
 
standard, Director must prove by a preponderance of the evidence
5
 
that "(1) the [cited] standard applies, (2) there was a failure
 
5
 HRS § 91-10(5) (Supp. 2010) provides: "Except as otherwise provided
by law, the party initiating the proceeding shall have the burden of proof,
including the burden of producing evidence as well as the burden of
persuasion. The degree or quantum of proof shall be a preponderance of the
evidence."

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
to comply with the cited standard, (3) an employee had access to
 
the violative condition, and (4) the employer knew or should have
 
known of the condition with the exercise of due diligence." 
Dir., Dep't of Labor & Indus. Relations v. Maryl Pac.
 
Constructors, Inc., Case No. OSAB 2001-18, 2002 WL 31757252, at
 
*6.
 
After the administrative hearing, HLRB found in FOF 33
 
of its Decision No. 24 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and
 
Order that Permasteelisa had complied with the cited standard and
 
utilized a personal fall arrest system:
 
With respect to Citation 1, Item 1, alleging a violation of
29 CFR § 1926.501(b)(1), after reviewing the record, the
Board finds that [Permasteelisa] utilized a personal fall
arrest system to protect its workers against fall hazards on
the high rise Moana Pacific project. On March 14, 2007,
Montayre, a veteran iron worker and working foreman, fell to
his death while working on the 46th floor. The lanai of the
 unit Montayre was working on had three of four glass panels
missing from the mid-railing leaving the balcony's side
unguarded. An anchor hole had been drilled into the floor
 of the unit to insert the anchor claw for the fall
 protection equipment and upon examination by the HIOSH
compliance officer, Montayre's equipment was fully
functional. Tragically, Montayre was not wearing his
personal fall protection equipment provided by
[Permasteelisa] when he fell. The Board accepts Flippo's
opinion, that [Permasteelisa] provided protection for
Montayre from fall hazards by providing him a functional
personal fall arrest system and thereby complied with 29 CFR
§ 1926.501. Chun
6 testified that under 29 CFR [§]
1926.502(a)(2) which states that the employer shall provide
and install all fall protection systems required by this
subpart for the employee, it was his opinion that someone
from the employer was required to insert Montayre's anchor
into the hole for him. Lupian
7 testified that he would
 
install his own anchor because he didn't want to trust
 someone else with his life. Although the citing compliance
officer testified that he expected [Permasteelisa] to insert
the anchor in the hole in order to comply with the HIOSH
standards, the testimony of witnesses indicated that each
worker installs his own anchor to engage his fall protection
equipment.
 
6
 Clayton Chun took over the investigation after Flippo went on medical
leave.
7
 Jose Lupian was Permasteelisa's project manager.
 
7
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Based on this finding, HLRB then concluded in COL 8
 
that Permasteelisa had complied with the standard set forth in 29
 
C.F.R. § 1926.501(b)(1):
 
Based upon the record, the Board finds that [Permasteelisa]
complied with the standard. [Permasteelisa] had a personal
fall arrest system being utilized at the Moana Pacific
project at the time to protect its employees from fall
hazards and provided a working personal fall protection
system to Montayre. As a working foreman with a reputation
of being safety conscious for himself and his men,
[Permasteelisa] had no reason to expect that Montayre would
proceed to work on the lanai without his fall protection
equipment. HIOSH's expectation that [Permasteelisa] insert
the anchor for its workers' fall protection is unreasonable.
Based upon the record, the Board concludes that
[Permasteelisa] did not violate 29 CFR § 1926.501(b)(1).
 
HLRB's decision should be upheld "if supported by 
reliable, probative and substantial evidence unless the reviewing 
court is left with a firm and definite conviction that a mistake 
has been made." Poe v. Hawai' i Labor Relations Bd., 105 Hawai' i 
97, 100, 94 P.3d 652, 655 (2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In the instant case, the circuit court found 
there was "reliable, probative, and substantial evidence in the 
record to sustain the facts which were established in the 
Decision and Order appealed from; and that given those facts and 
circumstances[,] . . . there is no error of law and, therefore, 
[the circuit court] affirms the decision appealed from." 
Because this case presents a mixed question of law and 
fact, the appellate court gives deference to the agency's 
expertise and experience. Igawa v. Koa House Rest., 97 Hawai' i 
402, 406, 38 P.3d 570, 574 (2001). Deference is "especially due in the discrete context of an agency's interpretation of its own 
administrative rules," Kiewit Pac., 104 Hawai' i at 29, 84 P.3d at 
537 (footnote omitted), reasoning that the agency acquires expertise in the process of promulgating and enforcing the rules. 
Id. at 32, 84 P.3d at 540. 
However, here, it is questionable what expertise was
 
acquired in the promulgation of the regulations because HAR § 12­
8
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
121.2-1 is merely the wholesale adoption by the agency of the
 
relevant federal regulations:
 
§12-121.2-1 Incorporation of federal standard.  Title
 
29, Code of Federal Regulations, Subpart M, entitled "Fall
Protection," published by the Office of the Federal
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, on
August 9, 1994; and the amendments published on January 26,
1995; August 2, 1995; and January 18, 2001, are made a part
of this chapter.
 
Nevertheless, deference should be given to the agency's 
interpretation of the regulatory scheme "so long as the 
department is legislatively delegated the franchise of 
promulgating the pertinent regulations, and acquires relevant 
expertise in enforcing them." Kiewit Pac., 104 Hawai' i at 34, 84 
P.3d at 542. 
The relationship between Director and HLRB presents a
 
unique question as to which agency actor is owed deference. 
"Under most regulatory schemes, rulemaking, enforcement, and
 
adjudicative powers are combined in a single administrative
 
authority." Martin v. Occupational Safety & Health Review
 
Comm'n, 499 U.S. 144, 151, 111 S. Ct. 1171, 1176 (1991). But
 here, the roles of Director and HLRB, modeled after the roles of
 
the federal Secretary of Labor (Secretary) and the Occupational
 
Safety and Health Review Commission (Commission), id. at 147, 111
 
S. Ct. at 1174, create a split authority between the two actors. 
Id. at 151, 111 S. Ct. at 1176. Under the Occupational Safety
 
and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act), enforcement and rulemaking
 
authority is granted to the Secretary, while adjudicative
 
authority is granted to the Commission. Willy v. Admin. Review
 
Bd., 423 F.3d 483, 493-94 (5th Cir. 2005). 
Where "two functionally -- but not formally -- separate
 
agencies vie over the interpretation of their occupational safety
 and health regulations, one agency generally charged with
 
promulgation and enforcement and the other agency generally
 
charged with adjudication," we are faced with a "split
 
9
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
enforcement" structure and must determine to whom deference is
 
owed. Kiewit Pac., 104 Hawai' i at 30-31, 84 P.3d at 538-39. 
In Hawaii, enforcement and rulemaking authority is
 
granted to Director, and adjudicative authority is granted to
 
HLRB. HRS §§ 396-4 (Supp. 2010) and 396-11 (1993). Because this
 
"split enforcement" structure is modeled after the structure in
 
the federal OSH Act, we look "to the interpretations of analogous
 
federal laws by the federal courts for guidance." French v.
 
Hawaii Pizza Hut, Inc., 105 Hawai' i 462, 467, 99 P.3d 1046, 1051 
(2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
In Martin, the United States Supreme Court considered
 
"whether a reviewing court should defer to the Secretary or to
 the Commission when these actors furnish reasonable but
 
conflicting interpretations of an ambiguous regulation under the
 
OSH Act." Martin, 499 U.S. at 150, 111 S. Ct. at 1175 (footnote
 
omitted). The Supreme Court held that because the OSH Act
 
granted the Secretary the authority "to promulgate and to enforce
 
national health and safety standards," courts should defer to the
 
Secretary's, rather than the Commissioner's, interpretation of
 
the regulations. Id. at 152, 111 S. Ct. at 1176. The Court
 
reasoned:
 
[T]he power to render authoritative interpretations of OSH
Act regulations is a "necessary adjunct" of the Secretary's
powers to promulgate and to enforce national health and
safety standards. The Secretary enjoys readily identifiable
structural advantages over the Commission in rendering
authoritative interpretations of OSH Act regulations.
Because the Secretary promulgates these standards, the
Secretary is in a better position than is the Commission to
reconstruct the purpose of the regulations in question.
Moreover, by virtue of the Secretary's statutory role as
enforcer, the Secretary comes into contact with a much
greater number of regulatory problems than does the
Commission, which encounters only those regulatory episodes
resulting in contested citations. Consequently, the
Secretary is more likely to develop the expertise relevant
to assessing the effect of a particular regulatory
interpretation. Because historical familiarity and
policymaking expertise account in the first instance for the
presumption that Congress delegates interpretive lawmaking
power to the agency rather than to the reviewing court, we
presume here that Congress intended to invest interpretive
power in the administrative actor in the best position to
develop these attributes.
 
10
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Martin, 499 U.S. at 152-53, 111 S. Ct. at 1176-77 (citations
 
omitted).
 
The Supreme Court stressed the narrowness of its
 
ruling, noting that it had based its conclusions on Congress's
 
apparent intent not to preclude the Secretary from interpreting
 
OSH Act regulations. Martin, 499 U.S. at 157-58, 111 S. Ct. at
 
1179. At the same time, the Court emphasized that "the reviewing
 court should defer to the Secretary only if the Secretary's
 
interpretation is reasonable. The Secretary's interpretation of
 
an ambiguous regulation is subject to the same standard of
 
substantive review as any other exercise of delegated lawmaking
 
power." Id. at 158, 111 S. Ct. at 1180. 
This court has followed Martin and deferred to the 
Director when the Director and the review board offered 
conflicting interpretations of an ambiguous regulation. Kiewit 
Pac., 104 Hawai' i at 36-37, 84 P.3d at 544-45. However, "[i]f an 
administrative rule's language is unambiguous, and its literal 
application is neither inconsistent with the policies of the 
statute the rule implements nor produces an absurd or unjust 
result, courts enforce the rule's plain meaning." Int'l Bhd. of 
Elec. Workers, Local 1357, v. Hawaiian Tel. Co., 68 Haw. 316, 323, 713 P.2d 943, 950 (1986). 
Therefore, to determine if judicial deference to 
Director applies in the instant case, we must determine (a) if 
the regulatory language in question is ambiguous and (b) if the 
language is ambiguous, is Director's interpretation reasonable. 
An interpretation is reasonable if it "sensibly conforms to the 
purpose and wording of the regulations, Northern Indiana Pub. 
Serv. Co. v. Porter County Chapter of Izaak Walton League of 
America, Inc., 423 U.S. 12, 15, 96 S. Ct. 172, 173 . . . (1975)." 
Kiewit Pac., 104 Hawai' i at 32, 84 P.3d at 540 (quoting Martin, 
499 U.S. at 151, 111 S. Ct. at 1176). Furthermore, "the agency's decision must be consistent with the legislative purpose." 
Camara, 67 Haw. at 216, 685 P.2d at 797.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
As previously explained, the federal fall protection
 
standards set forth in 29 C.F.R. § 1926, Subpart M, are
 
incorporated wholesale into HAR. HAR § 12-121.2-1. The
 
subsections of 29 C.F.R. applicable to this discussion are
 
§§ 1926.500, 1926.501(a)(1), and 1926.501(b)(1).
 
Section 1926.500 sets forth the scope of the fall
 
protection standards, stating that "[s]ection 1926.501 sets forth
 
those workplaces, conditions, operations, and circumstances for
 
which fall protection shall be provided," 29 C.F.R.
 
§§ 1926.500(a)(2), and "[s]ection 1926.502 sets forth the
 
requirements for the installation, construction, and proper use
 
of fall protection required by part 1926," 29 C.F.R.
 
§ 1926.500(a)(3). 
Section 1926.501(a)(1) states: "This section sets
 
forth requirements for employers to provide fall protection
 
systems. All fall protection required by this section shall
 
conform to the criteria set forth in § 1926.502 of this subpart."
 
Section § 1926.501(b)(1) states: 
Unprotected sides and edges. Each employee on a walking/
working surface (horizontal and vertical surface) with an
unprotected side or edge which is 6 feet (1.8 m) or more
above a lower level shall be protected from falling by the
use of guardrail systems, safety net systems, or personal
fall arrest systems.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
At the heart of the discussion is the meaning of the
 
words "provide" and "use." Director argues that "the use" in
 
§ 1926.501(b)(1) means the employer has not met the standard
 
unless the employee is actually using the personal fall arrest
 
system that the employer provided. Permasteelisa contends "the
 
use" in this context directs the employer to "use," in the sense
 
of "provide," one of the three options: the guardrail system,
 
the safety net system, or the personal fall arrest system.
 
Section 1926.501 is titled "Duty to have fall
 
protection." Under § 1926.501(a), the regulation states
 
specifically: "This section sets forth requirements for
 
12
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
employers to provide fall protection systems." Section
 
1926.501(b)(1) requires that an employee on a working surface
 
with an unprotected side or edge six feet or more above a lower
 
level "shall be protected from falling by the use of guardrail
 
systems, safety net systems, or personal fall arrest systems." 
The guardrail or safety net systems are static systems installed
 
by the employer, while the personal fall arrest protection system
 
involves equipment provided to and used by the employee as
 
needed.
 
Only under § 1926.501(b) does the word "use" appear;
 
elsewhere in the fall protection system regulations, the word
 
"provide" is the operative word. Nowhere does the regulation
 
state that the employer shall ensure the use of the personal fall
 
arrest system by inserting the anchor for the employee rather
 
than training and directing the employee to insert the anchor, as
 
was the case here.
 
The OSH Act should not be read as a strict liability
 
statute; "the mere fact that violative conduct occurred is not,
 
of itself sufficient to establish employer liability." W.G.
 
Yates & Sons Constr. Co. v. Occupational Safety & Health Review
 Comm'n, 459 F.3d 604, 609 & n.8 (5th Cir. 2006) (employer not
 
liable where employee's violative conduct of working without the
 
required fall protection gear was not reasonably foreseeable). 
The OSH Act provides that "employers and employees have separate
 
but dependent responsibilities . . . with respect to achieving
 
safe . . . working conditions." 29 U.S.C. § 651(b)(2). 
Employers "shall furnish . . . a place of employment which [is]
 
free from recognized hazards." 29 U.S.C. § 654(a)(1). But also,
 
"[e]ach employee shall comply with occupational safety and health
 
standards and all rules, regulations, and orders . . . which are
 
applicable to [the employee's] own actions and conduct." 29
 
U.S.C. § 654(b); HAR § 12-51-1. In the instant case, Montayre
 
did not insert the anchor of his personal fall arrest system as
 
he had been trained and directed to do by Permasteelisa.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
When 29 C.F.R. § 1926.501(b) is read in context, the
 
language of the regulation does not appear to be ambiguous and
 
clearly does not require the employer to ensure the use of the
 
fall protection arrest system by inserting the anchor for the
 
employee. Permasteelisa complied with § 1926.501(b) when it
 
provided a fall protection system with training and direction in
 
its use.
