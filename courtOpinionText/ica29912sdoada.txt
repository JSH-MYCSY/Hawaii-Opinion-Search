SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant/Counterclaimant/Third-Party Plaintiff-
Appellant Barry Curtis (Curtis) appeals from the interlocutory
 
"Order Denying Defendant/Third-Party Plaintiff Barry Curtis'
 
Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings Pursuant to [Hawaii Revised
 
Statutes (HRS)] Chapter 634F, or in the Alternative, Pursuant to
 
[Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP)] Rule 12(B)(6)" (Order) NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
filed on June 17, 2009 in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit
 
(circuit court).1
 
On appeal,2
 Curtis contends the circuit court erred in
denying his April 1, 2009 "Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings
 
Pursuant to HRS Chapter 634F, or in the Alternative, Pursuant to
 
HRCP Rule 12(B)(6)" (Motion), under HRS Chapter 634F, because the
 
court (1) misinterpreted the definition of "proceeding," (2)
 
construed HRS Chapter 634F narrowly rather than liberally, (3)
 
found that Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant-Appellee Collin
 
Cabatbat (Cabatbat) had met his burden of proof and persuasion
 
under HRS ยง 634F-2(4)(B) (Supp. 2010), and (4) ruled that
 
Cabatbat's Second Amended Complaint did not constitute a
 
strategic lawsuit against public participation (SLAPP). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Curtis's
 
points of error as follows:
 
Curtis argues that the circuit court erred when it held
 
that his letter and affidavit were not protected under HRS
 
Chapter 634F. Chapter 634F was enacted to prevent a SLAPP that
 
"lacks substantial justification or is interposed for delay or
 
harassment" and is "solely based on the party's public
 
participation before a governmental body." 
HRS ยง 634F-1. 
Chapter 634F protects "oral or written testimony submitted or
 provided to a governmental body during the course of a
 
governmental proceeding." HRS ยง 634F-1. Curtis's letter and
 
affidavit sent to the principal of Waiakea High School were not

 The Honorable Greg K. Nakamura presided.
 
2
 Curtis's opening brief fails to comply with Hawai' i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(3) in that the statement of the case
fails to set forth "record references supporting each statement of fact ormention of court . . . proceedings." (Emphasis added.) Curtis's counsel are warned that, pursuant to HRAP Rule 51, future non-compliance with HRAP 28 mayresult in sanctions against them.

written testimony submitted during the course of a governmental
 
proceeding; therefore, the circuit court did not err when it held
 
that Cabatbat's lawsuit against Curtis was not a SLAPP as defined
 
under HRS Chapter 634F.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Order Denying
 
Defendant/Third-Party Plaintiff Barry Curtis' Motion for Judgment
 on the Pleadings Pursuant to HRS Chapter 634F, or in the
 
Alternative, Pursuant to HRCP Rule 12(B)(6)" filed on June 17,
 
2009 in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit is affirmed.
