STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
JOSEPH ELLIOT, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
EWA DIVISION
(CASE NO. 1DTA-08-10230)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Joseph R. Elliott, Jr. ( )
appeals from the Judgment entered against him on May 26, 2009, in
the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division
(District Court ).1  Elliott was convicted of Operating a Vehicle
Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of
Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 291E-61(a) and (b) (Supp. 2009).Elliott
On appeal, Elliott contends that the District Court
erred by denying his motion to dismiss the charge because the
oral charge for OVUII failed to state an essential element of the
offense, i.e., that Elliott operated or assumed actual physical
control of a vehicle upon a public way, street, road, or highway.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Elliott's point of error as follows:
 "[T]he operation of a vehicle on a public way, street,
road, or highway is an attendant circumstance of the offense of
OVUII, and is therefore an element of the offense."  State v.
Wheeler, 121 Hawai# i 383, 393, 219 P.3d 1170, 1180 (2009).  The
failure to allege that Elliott was driving a vehicle upon aNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2public way, street, road, or highway at the time of the offense
rendered the charge deficient.  Id.  Accordingly, the charge must
be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 
Therefore, the District Court's May 26, 2009 Judgment
is vacated and this case is remanded to the District Court for
dismissal of the OVUII charge without prejudice.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, May 13, 2010.
