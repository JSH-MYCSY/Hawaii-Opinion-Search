OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
OLEG P. SOLODAR, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 1DTC-09-034172)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Leonard, J., and Circuit Judge Del Rosario,
in place of Foley and Fujise, JJ., both recused)
 
Defendant-Appellant Oleg P. Solodar (Solodar) appeals

from the Judgment filed on June 15, 2009,  in the District Court
of the First Circuit (district court).2 Solodar was convicted of
 
excessive speeding in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 
§§ 291C-105(a)(1), -105(c)(1) (2007 & Supp. 2009).
 
On appeal, Solodar argues that: 1) his waiver of his
 
right to counsel at trial was invalid because the district court
 failed to adequately advise him of the risks of representing
 himself; and 2) the district court committed plain error by
 admitting evidence of a laser gun's speed reading without an
 adequate foundation for such evidence being laid. 
We resolve Solodar's points of error as follows:
 1. In accepting Solodar's waiver of his right to
 
counsel, the district court only advised Solodar that the
 excessive speeding charge against him was a crime, not just a
 traffic infraction, and that the maximum penalty was "five days

[in] jail."3 The district court did not advise Solodar of the
 
3 We note that the district court's advisement on the record
 
regarding the punishment that could be imposed was incomplete.
Solodar was subject to the following penalties under HRS § 291C­105(c)(1), which provides as follows:
 
(c) Any person who violates this section shall be
guilty of a petty misdemeanor and shall be sentenced as
follows without the possibility of probation or
suspension of sentence:
 
(1) For a first offense not preceded by a prior
conviction for an offense under this section
 in the preceding five years: 
(A)	 A fine of not less than $500 and not
 
more than $1,000; 
(B) Thirty-day prompt suspension of license
and privilege to operate a vehicle
during the suspension period, or the
court may impose, in lieu of the
thirty-day prompt suspension of license,
a minimum fifteen-day prompt suspension
of license with absolute prohibition
from operating a vehicle and, for the
remainder of the thirty-day period, a
restriction on the license that allows
 the person to drive for limited
work-related purposes; 
(C) 	Attendance in a course of instruction in
 driver retraining; 
(D) A surcharge of $25 to be deposited into
the neurotrauma special fund; 
(E) May be charged a surcharge of up to $100
to be deposited into the trauma system
special fund if the court so orders; 
(F)	 An assessment for driver education
 pursuant to section 286G-3; and 
(G) Either one of the following: 
(i) Thirty-six hours of community
service work; or

risks of self-representation. Plaintiff-Appellee State of 
Hawai'i (State) acknowledges that the district court's colloquy 
was inadequate to ensure that Solodar's waiver of his right to counsel was made knowingly and intelligently. We agree that the district court's colloquy was deficient, and we conclude that Solodar did not validly waive his right to counsel. See State v. 
Dickson, 4 Haw. App. 614, 618-23, 673 P.2d 1036, 1041-43 (1983); Carvalho v. Olim, 55 Haw. 336, 342-43, 519 P.2d 892, 897 (1974). Such error was not harmless. See Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 
18, 23 n.8 (1967) (violating a criminal defendant's right to counsel can never be harmless error); Arizona v. Fulminate, 499 U.S. 279, 309-10 (1991). 
2. At trial, Honolulu Police Department Officer Mark 
Suaglar (Officer Suaglar) testified without any objection from Solodar that Officer Suaglar's laser gun showed that Solodar's vehicle was traveling 66 miles per hour in an area where the speed limit was 35 miles per hour. On appeal, Solodar argues that the district court plainly erred in admitting Officer Suaglar's testimony regarding the laser gun's speed reading because the State failed to lay a sufficient foundation for such testimony. We disagree. By failing to object to Officer Suaglar's testimony regarding the laser gun's speed reading at trial, Solodar waived his right to challenge the admission of that testimony on appeal. See State v. Wallace, 80 Hawai
'i 382, 
409-10, 910 P.2d 695, 722-23 (1996); State v. Winfrey, No. 28737, 2009 WL 4988719 (Hawai
'i December 22, 2009) (order affirming 
judgment on appeal); State v. Duran, No. 30047, 2010 WL 2914377 (Hawai
'i App. July 27, 2010) (summary disposition order). 
Considering Officer Suaglar's testimony, there was sufficient evidence to support Solodar's conviction.
