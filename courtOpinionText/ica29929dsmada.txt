(3) Time to Appeal Affected by Post-Judgment Motions.  If any
party files a timely motion for judgment as a matter of law, to amend

IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
MICHAEL P. FLINCHBAUGH, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
JOHN R. CATES, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 05-1-1022)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
jurisdiction over the appeal that Defendant-Appellant John R.
Cates (Appellant Cates) has asserted from the Honorable Gary W.
B. Chang's January 9, 2009 judgment, because Appellant Cates's
appeal is untimely under Rule 4(a)(3) of the Hawai #i Rules of
Appellate Procedure (HRAP).
The January 9, 2009 judgment resolved all claims
against all parties, and, thus, the January 9, 2009 judgment is
an appealable final judgment pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes
(HRS) ยง 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2008), Rule 58 of the Hawai# i
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP), and the holding in Jenkins v.
Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai #i 115, 119, 869 P.2d
1334, 1338 (1994).  Pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(3),1 Appellant
Cates extended the thirty-day time period under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1)
for filing a notice of appeal by timely filing Appellant Cates'sNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
The tenth calendar day after January 9, 2009, was Monday,2
January 19, 2009, which was  Martin Luther King Day, and, thus, HRCP Rule 6(a)
extended the ten-day deadline under HRCP Rule 50 and HRCP Rule 59 until
Tuesday, January 20, 2009.
-2-January 20, 20092 HRCP Rule 50 and HRCP Rule 59 motion for
judgment as a matter of law, a new trial or, in the alternative,
remittitur within ten days after entry of the January 9, 2009
judgment, as HRCP Rule 50 and HRCP Rule 59 required for such a
motion.  However, when a party files a timely post-judgment
motion that tolls the time period for filing a notice of appeal
pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(3), "[t]he rule provides that the
court has 90 days to dispose of [the] post-judgment [tolling]
motion . . . , regardless of when the notice of appeal is filed." 
Buscher v. Boning, 114 Hawai #i 202, 221, 159 P.3d 814, 833
(2007); see HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) ("[T]he failure to dispose of any
motion by order entered upon the record within 90 days after the
date the motion was filed shall constitute a denial of the
motion.").  When "the court fail[s] to issue an order on [the
movant]'s [post-judgment tolling] motion by . . . ninety days
after [the date on which the movant] filed the [post-judgment
tolling] motion, the [post-judgment tolling] motion [i]s deemed
denied."  County of Hawai #i v. C&J Coupe Family Limited
Partnership, 119 Hawai# i 352, 367, 198 P.3d 615, 630 (2008).  The
ninetieth day after January 20, 2009, was April 20, 2009, at the
end of which time Appellant Cates's January 20, 2009 HRCP Rule 50
and HRCP Rule 59 motion for judgment as a matter of law, a new
trial or, in the alternative, remittitur was deemed denied
pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(3).  Although the circuit court later
entered a June 26, 2009 written order that purports to deny
Appellant Cates's January 20, 2009 HRCP Rule 50 and HRCP Rule 59
motion for judgment as a matter of law, a new trial or, in the
alternative, remittitur, the June 26, 2009 written order is
untimely, superfluous, and void under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). 
Appellant Cates did not file his July 6, 2009 notice of appeal
within thirty days after the April 20, 2009 deemed denial of
Cates's January 20, 2009 HRCP Rule 50 and HRCP Rule 59 motion for
judgment as a matter of law, a new trial or, in the alternative,NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
-3-remittitur, as HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) required.  Therefore, Cates's
July 6, 2009 notice of appeal is untimely under HRAP
Rule 4(a)(3).  The failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a
civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot
waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise
of judicial discretion.  Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727
P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or
justice thereof is authorized to change the jurisdictional
requirements contained in Rule 4 of [the HRAP].").  Consequently,
we lack appellate jurisdiction over this case.  Therefore,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appeal No. 29929 is dismissed
for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
