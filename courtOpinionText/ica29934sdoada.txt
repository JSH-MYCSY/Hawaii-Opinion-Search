appeals from the June 16, 2009 Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or
 
Order and Plea/Judgment ("Judgment") filed in the District Court
 of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division ("District Court").
1
 
Akitake was convicted by the District Court of Operating a
 Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant ("OVUII") in
 violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 291E-61(a)(1)
 (Supp. 2008).

On appeal, Akitake contends that the District Court (1)
 
erred in failing to sua sponte dismiss the charge for lack of

 Operating a vehicle under the influence of an
intoxicant. (a) A person commits the offense of
operating a vehicle under the influence of an
intoxicant if the person operates or assumes actual
physical control of a vehicle:
 
(1)	 While under the influence of alcohol in an
 amount sufficient to impair the person's normal
mental faculties or ability to care for the
person and guard against casualty[.]

jurisdiction, and (2) abused its discretion in granting a fourth
 
day of trial over Akitake's objection.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 affirm the Judgment and address the issues on appeal as follows:
 
(1) Both the complaint and the oral charge at trial 
failed to allege that Akitake's operation of the vehicle occurred on a "public road, street, or highway," an attendant circumstance of the offense that must be alleged. State v. Wheeler, 121 
Hawai'i 383, 393, 219 P.3d 1170, 1180 (2009). 
Akitake did not challenge the sufficiency of the charge
 
at trial. Thus, we utilize the "liberal construction standard"
 to determine the sufficiency of the charge. State v. Tominiko, 
No. SCWC-29535, 2011 WL 4375245, *1, *7 (Haw. Aug. 26, 2011). 
"This standard 'means we will not reverse a conviction based upon
 a defective indictment unless the defendant can show prejudice or
 that the indictment cannot within reason be construed to charge a
 crime.'" Id. (citing State v. Motta, 66 Haw. 89, 91, 657 P.2d
 1019, 1020 (1983)).
 
The State asserts that the "public road" element of the
 
charge can be discerned from reference to the companion charges
 of Traffic-Control Signal Legend (HRS § 291C-32(a)(3)(A)) and
 Longitudinal Traffic Lane Markings (HRS § 291C-38(c)) because the
 oral charges on those violations referred to the indicators of a
 "red signal," "fully marked stop line," "crosswalk," and "double
 solid yellow line," which are all indicative of a public
 roadway.

Officer Ronald Lopes, the arresting officer in the
 
case, testified that the traffic signals were traditional "City
 and County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii traffic signals" because
 they had "the identification decal on them." Officer Lopes
 further testified that the crosswalk and its related stop line
 were an "official City and County of Honolulu and[/or] State of

 Akitake was tried jointly on the OVUII and the companion charges.
The oral charges associated with the companion charges were stated, along with
an oral charge on OVUII, immediately before the trial commenced. H AW. REV.
 
STAT. § 291D-3(b) (2008).

Hawaii" cross walk and stop line because he observed "City guys"
 
painting them "all the time." 
Officer Lopes' also testified that the infractions and
 
violations occurred while Akitake was driving eastbound on
 Prospect Street. The citation on the companion charges issued by
 Officer Lopes to Akitake identified "Prospect/Ward" as the
 location of the violation, and stated that Akitake was traveling
 "east/Prospect" at the time.
 
Under the liberal construction analysis we interpret a 
charge as a whole, employing practical considerations and common sense. State v. Sprattling, 99 Hawai' i 312, 318-19, 55 P.3d 276, 
282-83 (2002). A companion charge that contains the public roadway allegation provides a sufficient basis to uphold the primary OVUII charge. Tominiko, 2011 WL 4375245 at *7 (companion 
charge for driving without insurance alleged that the incident took place "upon a public street, road, or highway of the State of Hawaii"); see also State v. Elliot, 77 Hawai' i 309, 312, 884 
P.2d 372, 375 (1994) (the charges can be read together to determine whether they were sufficient). Because the OVUII and companion charges all refer to operating a motor vehicle in the City and County of Honolulu on the same day, it can reasonably be inferred that they refer to the same incident. Tominiko, 2011 WL 
4375245 at *7. 
Although the companion charges in this case do not
 
explicitly include the public roadway allegation, they refer to a
 red signal, a marked stop line, a crosswalk, and double solid
 yellow lines in the roadway, which are all indicative of a public
 roadway. In addition, the citation for the companion charges
 reflects that the violations occurred on Prospect Street. See
 
Tominiko, 2011 WL 4375245 at *8. 
We conclude that when the OVUII charge is read together
 
4
with the companion charges and the related citation  under the
liberal construction standard the charges can reasonably be
 construed to charge the public roadway requirement. When read

 The companion charges' citation and oral recitation are properly
considered in determining the sufficiency of the primary charge. See State v. 
Mita, 124 Hawai' i 385, 389 n.6, 245 P.3d 458, 463 n.6 (2010); H AW. REV. STAT. 
§ 291D-3(b).

together, the charges provided Akitake with sufficient notice
 
that the charged conduct took place on a public roadway, namely,
 Prospect Street, and that he was charged with having committed
 the OVUII offense "upon a public way, street or highway."
5 As a
 
result, the District Court did not err in failing to sua sponte
 dismiss the charge for lack of jurisdiction.
 
(2) The District Court had already concluded that trial
 
would not be completed on its third day, stating, "Well, you can
 continue with Officer Tamanaha whichever way you wish. I don't
 think we're going to finish today[.]" Consequently, it was not
 an abuse of discretion for the District Court to have granted the
 State its requested continuance.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the District
 
Court's June 16, 2009 Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order
 and Plea/Judgment is affirmed.

 We do not reach here whether, under the liberal construction
standard, we can consider the testimony related to the primary and/or
companion charges introduced at trial because the companion charges' citation
and oral charges are a sufficient basis upon which to infer that Prospect
Street is a public roadway.
