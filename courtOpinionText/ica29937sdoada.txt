APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 08-1-0905)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Ginzoa, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Glenn Keohokapu, Jr. (Appellant) 
appeals from the judgment of conviction and sentence, entered 
June 22, 2009, by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit 
court).1 A jury found Appellant guilty of manslaughter, in 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-702(1)(a) (Supp. 2010), for stabbing Steven Wilcox during a fight at a 
Kâne�ohe night club on June 7, 2008. After sentencing hearings, 
the jury found that (1) Appellant was a persistent offender under 
2
HRS §706-662 (Supp. 2010),  and that (2) "it is necessary for the

 HRS § 706-662 reads now, as it did then:
 
Criteria for extended terms of imprisonment.  A defendant
 
who has been convicted of a felony may be subject to an
extended term of imprisonment under section 706-661 if it is
proven beyond a reasonable doubt that an extended term of
imprisonment is necessary for the protection of the public
and that the convicted defendant satisfies one or more of

protection of the public to subject [Appellant] to an extended
 
term of imprisonment[.]" Pursuant to HRS § 706-661
 
3
(Supp. 2010),  the circuit court sentenced Appellant to an
extended term of life in prison with the possibility of parole
 
and ordered him to pay restitution.
 
Appellant claims that the circuit court erred (1) 
during jury selection, by denying a defense motion to strike 
jurors who had been exposed to pre-trial publicity and "by 
reading the entire venire a pretrial publicity statement which 
suggested that the decedent was 'a good Samaritan'"; (2) during 
the sentencing hearing, by admitting into evidence testimony 
under the "present recollection refreshed" and "past recollection 
recorded" exceptions to the hearsay rule; (3) by allowing the 
prosecutor's rebuttal argument during the sentencing hearing to 
"misstat[e] the law and attempt[] to inflame the jury with 
sympathy for the decedent;" and (4) by instructing the jury on 
parole and the Hawai� i Paroling Authority. 
(...continued)
the following criteria:
 
(1)	 The defendant is a persistent offender in that the
defendant has previously been convicted of two or more
felonies committed at different times when the
 defendant was eighteen years of age or older[.]

Extended terms of imprisonment.  The court may sentence a
person who satisfies the criteria for any of the categories
set forth in section 706-662 to an extended term of
 imprisonment, which shall have a maximum length as follows:
 
. . . .
 
(2) For a class A felony--indeterminate life term of
imprisonment;
 . . . . 
When ordering an extended term sentence, the court shall
impose the maximum length of imprisonment. The minimum
 length of imprisonment for an extended term sentence under
paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) shall be determined by the
Hawaii paroling authority in accordance with section
706-669.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties and
 
the relevant law, we resolve Appellant's points of error as
 
follows:
 
(1) The circuit court did not abuse its discretion
 
during jury selection proceedings, including its decision to deny
 
Appellant's motion to strike all prospective jurors who had heard
 
any media account of the incident. See State v. Altergott, 57
 
Haw. 492, 499-500, 599 P.2d 728, 733-34 (1977). 
The constitutional guarantee of a right to a trial by 
an impartial jury requires that the jury be "substantially free from the biasing effects of inflammatory pre-trial publicity." 
State v. Pauline, 100 Hawai� i 356, 366, 60 P.3d 306, 316 (2002) 
(internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting State v. Pokini, 55 Haw. 640, 641, 526 P.2d 94, 99 (1974)). Once an accused claims 
that his or her right to a fair trial has been jeopardized by 
"outside influences infecting a jury," i.e., publicity in the 
news media, the court must determine "whether the nature of the 
outside influences rises to the level of being substantially 
prejudicial." State v. Okumura, 78 Hawai� i 383, 394, 894 P.2d 
80, 91 (1995) (quoting State v. Williamson, 72 Haw. 97, 102, 807 P.2d 593, 596 (1991)). "If it does not rise to such a level, the 
trial court is under no duty to interrogate the jury." Id. See 
also State v. Samonte, 83 Hawai� i 507, 531-32, 928 P.2d 1, 25-26 
(1996). However, if the court is satisfied that there is "so 
great a prejudice against the defendant that the defendant cannot 
obtain a fair and impartial trial," the court must, upon the 
defendant's motion, transfer the proceeding to another circuit. 
Hawai�i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 21(a). 
Although Appellant implies that there should have been 
a "presumption of prejudice" applied in this case, there is 
nothing in the record suggesting that media reports saturated the 
public to an extent warranting that presumption. See Pauline, 
100 Hawai� i at 365-66, 60 P.3d at 315-16 (citing Ainsworth v. 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Calderon, 138 F.3d 787, 795 (9th Cir. 1998) (citation omitted) 
(explaining that, in support of motion to transfer venue, 
prejudice may be presumed where defendant demonstrates that "the 
community where the trial was held was saturated with prejudicial 
and inflammatory media publicity about the crime")). The Hawai� i 
Supreme Court will presume that media reports have produced so much prejudice only in "extreme situations." Id. at 366, 60 P.3d 
at 316 (quoting State v. Kauhi, 86 Hawai� i 195, 200, 948 P.2d 
1036, 1041 (1997)). 
The circuit court stated that there was "some publicity 
with respect to this case", and from the fact that the court 
conducted further inquiry, we infer that the court found the 
media reports were "substantially prejudicial" but not so 
saturating that a "presumption of prejudice" arose. The level of 
prejudice arising from media reports is "ordinarily a question 
committed to the trial court's discretion." See Okumura, 78 
Hawai�i at 394, 894 P.2d at 91 (citation omitted). Nothing in 
the record supports a conclusion that the circuit court abused 
its discretion in its implied finding that publicity was 
"substantially prejudicial" but not presumptively so. 
Once the court determines that media coverage is 
"substantially prejudicial," the court has a duty to examine 
potential jurors. Id. at 394, 894 P.2d at 91. "The scope of the 
examination should vary, of course, with the extent, quality, and timing of pre-trial publicity present in each case." Pokini, 55 
Haw. at 642, 526 P.2d at 99; see also Pauline, 100 Hawai� i at 
367-68, 60 P.3d at 317-18; Skilling v. United States, ___ U.S. 
___, ___, 130 S. Ct. 2896, 2949 (2010) ("In selecting a jury, a 
trial court must take measures adapted to the intensity, 
pervasiveness, and character of the pretrial publicity and 
community animus. Reviewing courts, meanwhile, must assess 
whether the trial court's procedures sufficed under the 
circumstances to keep the jury free from disqualifying bias."). 
First, the circuit court must ask "whether any jurors
 
'had read or heard' the prejudicial publicity[.]" State v.
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Keliiholokai, 58 Haw. 356, 358, 569 P.2d 891, 894 (1977)
 
(citation omitted).4 Those that had, should "be examined,
 
individually and outside the presence of other jurors to
 determine the effect of the publicity." Id. The circuit court
 
did that here. 
Second, the court must probe jurors as to whether they
 
can be fair and impartial. See Pokini, 55 Haw. at 643, 526 P.2d
 
at 100. In addition to asking jurors whether they could view
 
evidence impartially despite whatever information they already
 
knew of the alleged crime, a trial court must conduct an
 
objective inquiry into the prospective jurors' potential biases
 
and ascertain "what information that the jurors had accumulated." 
Id. (citing Silverthorne v. United States, 400 F.2d 627, 638 (9th
 
Cir. 1968)). This so-called "content questioning" exceeds what
 
is required by the federal constitution. See Mu'Min v. Virginia,
 
500 U.S. 415, 427 & 431 (1991).
 
The circuit court and the parties here engaged in 
content questioning. The court conducted a "'thorough-going examination of veniremen who indicated they had been exposed' to 
negative publicity[.]" Pauline
, 100 Hawai� i at 369, 60 P.3d at 
319 (quoting Pokini, 55 Haw. at 643, 526 P.2d at 100). As in State v. Mark, "[t]he court's thorough voir dire protected 
[Appellant] from the effects of publicity about the case, and 
established an 'objective' record concerning the effect of 
publicity on potential jurors." 120 Hawai� i 499, 520, 210 P.3d 
22, 43 (App. 2009). "That record demonstrates that although many potential jurors knew about the case, the circuit court was able 
to identify and excuse those jurors whose ability to be fair and 
impartial had been affected." Id. 
We disagree with Appellant's contention that the whole
 
jury pool was tainted by the circuit court's reading of a
 
4
 "Although . . . Keliiholokai dealt with outside influences 
occurring after trial had begun, [its] admonitions are similarly applicable to
outside influences occurring prior to or during jury selection." Okumura, 78 
Hawai�i at 393, 894 P.2d at 90.

pretrial publicity statement which said that "Wilcox was 
described in the media as a good samaritan." Initially, we note 
the record does not reveal an objection to the reading of this 
statement. When the statement is compared with the facts 
presented at trial, "there is no indication that [the media 
description of Wilcox] so prejudiced [Appellant's] rights as to 
make a fair trial impossible." Wentz v. State, 766 N.E.2d 351, 
357 (Ind. 2002). Even if we were to assume the pretrial publicity statement was prejudicial, we do not find it to be 
plainly erroneous because defense counsel repeatedly asked jurors 
in voir dire what they thought of the Good Samaritan 
characterization. See State v. Rodrigues, 113 Hawai� i 41, 51, 
147 P.3d 825, 835 (2006) (refusing to find plain error where "the appellant's attorney intentionally elicited the same testimony on 
cross-examination" that he complains of on appeal) (internal 
quotation marks and citation omitted). We find no plain error 
here. 
Appellant raises a claim for the first time in his
 
opening brief's argument section that the formulation of the
 
publicity statement violated his "right to be present during all
 
stages of trial." The argument is deemed waived. State v.
 
Hoglund, 71 Haw. 147, 150, 785 P.2d 1311, 1313 (1990)
 ("Generally, the failure to properly raise an issue at the trial
 
level precludes a party from raising that issue on appeal.").
 
(2) Appellant argues that the circuit court erred
 
during the sentencing hearing by admitting testimony based on
 
witness statements included in police reports: a statement that
 
Appellant's wife Kauilani (Kaui) made to police in April 1996; a
 
statement Kaui made to police in July 1996; a statement Kaui made
 
to police in October 1994; and a statement that Gregory Balga
 
made in October 1993. Kaui's testimony regarding the 1996
 
statements to police were admissible, but the older statements
 
should have been excluded as they did not fall within an
 
exception to the hearsay rule.
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The circuit court admitted Kaui's testimony based on 
her April 1996 statement to police as a refreshed recollection 
under Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 612. "When used to 
refresh the witness's present recollection, a writing is solely 
employed to jog the memory of the testifying witness." State v. 
Dibenedetto, 80 Hawai� i 138, 144, 906 P.2d 624, 630 (App. 1995). 
If the writing does not refresh the witness's memory, the witness 
may not testify about or read the contents of the writing into 
evidence unless the writing is itself admitted under another 
evidence rule. State v. Espiritu, 117 Hawai� i 127, 137, 176 P.3d 
885, 895 (2008). Appellant appears to argue that Kaui read the statement rather than testified from memory. However, the 
transcript does not indicate as much. The State asked Kaui 
whether the April 1996 statement refreshed her memory and Kaui 
responded that it had. Given that Appellant did not object once 
Kaui stated her memory was refreshed, admission of the testimony 
will not constitute ground for reversal. See State v. Naeole, 62 
Haw. 563, 570, 617 P.2d 820, 826 (1980). 
Appellant objects to the admission of Kaui's testimony
 
regarding a July 1996 statement to police and Balga's handwritten
 statement to police under HRE 802.1(4), the past recollection
 
recorded exception to the hearsay rule. HRE Rule 802.1(4)
 
defines a past recollection recorded as a
 
memorandum or record concerning a matter about which the
witness once had knowledge but now has insufficient
recollection to enable the witness to testify fully and
accurately, shown to have been made or adopted by the
witness when the matter was fresh in the witness' memory and
to reflect that knowledge correctly.
 
The primary concern here is whether the statements were
 
accurate when Kaui and Balga made them. The commentary to
 
5
Rule 803(5) of the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE)  acknowledges
that "[n]o attempt is made in the exception to spell out the
 
5
 FRE Rule 803(5) is identical to HRE Rule 802.1(4). State v. 
Bloss, 3 Haw. App. 274, 278, 649 P.2d 1176, 1179 (1982); see also commentary
to HRE Rule 802.1(4). When the HRE rule is identical to a FRE rule, "we mayrefer to federal case law for assistance in construing our Rule." State v. 
Jhun, 83 Hawai� i 472, 478, 927 P.2d 1355, 1361 (1996) (brackets omitted).

method of establishing . . . accuracy of the record, leaving them
 
to be dealt with as the circumstances of the particular case
 
might indicate." Fed. R. Evid. 803(5) advisory committee's
 
notes.
 
The witness may testify either that he remembers making an
accurate recording of the event in question which he now no
longer sufficiently remembers, that he routinely makes
accurate records of this kind, or, if the witness has
entirely forgotten the exact situation in which the
recording was made, that he is confident from the
circumstances that he would not have written or adopted such
description of the facts unless that description truly
described his observations at the time.
 
30B Michael H. Graham, Federal Practice and Procedure: Evidence
 
§ 7046 at 489-91 (2006); see also 5 Joseph M. McLaughlin,
 
Weinstein's Federal Evidence § 803.07[3][c], at 803-52 (2d ed.
 
2011). "At the extreme, some courts find sufficient testimony
 
that the individual recognizes his or her signature and believes
 
the statement correct because the witness would not have signed
 
it if he or she had not believed it true at the time." 2 Kenneth
 
S. Broun et al., McCormick on Evidence § 283, at 299 (6th ed.
 
2006).
 
The State relies on United States v. Porter, in which
 
the Sixth Circuit noted, "[t]he touchstone for admission of
 
evidence as an exception to the hearsay rule has been the
 
existence of circumstances which attest to its trustworthiness."
 
986 F.2d 1014, 1017 (6th Cir. 1993) (internal quotation marks
 
omitted) (quoting United States v. Williams, 571 F.2d 344, 349
 
(6th Cir. 1978)). 
It is not a sine qua non of admissibility that the witness
actually vouch for the accuracy of the written memorandum.
Admissibility is, instead, to be determined on a
case-by-case basis upon a consideration . . . of factors
indicating trustworthiness, or the lack thereof.
 
Id. The government's key witness against Porter, his teenage
 
girlfriend, recanted her written statement made to the FBI. Id.
 
at 1016-17. Although the witness did not testify that the
 
statement was accurate, the Court of Appeals affirmed the
 
district court's finding that there were "sufficient indicia of
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
trustworthiness to admit portions of the statement" as a past
 
recollection recorded. Id. at 1017.
 
Unlike the witness in Porter, Kaui did not sign her
 
July 1996 statement under the penalty of perjury. Nevertheless,
 
there exists "sufficient indicia of trustworthiness" given that a
 
HPD officer's report, dated on the same date that Kaui wrote her
 
statement, corroborated Kaui's testimony by describing the
 
injuries she described. On the other hand, no corroborating
 
evidence supports Balga's statement. Although Balga acknowledged
 
that the handwriting and signature on the statement was his, he
 
made no averment that he would not have signed the document if it
 
were inaccurate. The State did not ask Balga whether the
 
statement was correct at the time it was written, apparently
 
relying on Balga's signature below the typewritten attestation
 
that "this statement is true and correct to the best of my
 
knowledge[.]"
 
One commentator noted that "[a]n assertion of [] 
accuracy in the acknowledgment line of a written statement or
 
such an acknowledgment made previously under oath is not
 
sufficient." McCormick on Evidence at 299 (citing 4 Mueller &
 
Kirkpatrick, Federal Evidence § 433, at 477-78 (2d ed. 1994) ("no
 intention to authorize trial by affidavits under this rule")). 
However, other jurisdictions, citing Porter, consider such an
 
attestation one indicia under a totality of the circumstances
 
test. See, e.g., Polite v. State, 41 So.3d 935, 941 (Fla. Dist.
 
Ct. App. 2010); State v. Alvarado, 949 P.2d 831, 836 (Wash. Ct.
 App. 1998) (among the circumstances to be considered are "(1)
 
whether the witness disavows accuracy; (2) whether the witness
 
averred accuracy at the time of making the statement; (3) whether
 
the recording process is reliable; and (4) whether other indicia
 
of reliability establish the trustworthiness of the statement").
 
Balga's admission of drug and alcohol use during the
 
period in which the incident occurred casts doubt on the
 
reliability of his statement. But cf. United States v. Edwards,
 
539 F.2d 689, 692 (9th Cir. 1976) (admitting statement under FRE
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
803(5) where arresting officer's testimony showed that declarant
 
"although inebriated, was capable of performing the relatively
 
sophisticated mental functions necessary to recall past events"). 
Unlike Polite, Alvarado, and Edwards, the State offered no
 
testimony to corroborate Balga's prior statement, nor did the
 
circuit court find that the statement bore sufficient indicia of
 
reliability to warrant its admission. Therefore, the State
 
failed to establish the foundation that Balga made the statement
 
"when the matter was fresh in [Balga's] memory and . . .
 
reflect[ed] that knowledge correctly" and the circuit court erred
 
in allowing portions of the statement to be read into evidence. 
HRE Rule 802.1(4).
 
We must consider whether the error in allowing this 
testimony and Kaui's October 1994 statement to the police, which 
the State concedes was erroneously admitted, was harmless. See 
State v. Rivera, 106 Hawai� i 146, 165-66, 102 P.3d 1044, 1063-64 
(2004) (holding that harmless error doctrine applied to errors 
implicating sentencing). Under the harmless error standard, the 
appellate court "must determine whether there is a reasonable 
possibility that the error complained of might have contributed 
to the conviction." Pauline, 100 Hawai� i at 378, 60 P.3d 306 at 
328 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). "If there is such a reasonable possibility in a criminal case, then the 
error is not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and the judgment 
of conviction on which it may have been based must be set aside." 
State v. Gano, 92 Hawai� i 161, 176, 988 P.2d 1153, 1168 (1999) 
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
The record contains competent evidence of Appellant's
 
criminal history, which included twenty convictions for burglary,
 robbery, promotion of a dangerous drug, domestic violence, and
 
parole violations. An HPD officer also testified that Appellant
 
injured a grocery store employee during a robbery, for which
 
Appellant pleaded guilty. The jury had ample evidence from which
 
to conclude "that an extended term of imprisonment is necessary
 
for the protection of the public." HRS § 706-622. Therefore,
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the erroneous admission of Balga's October 1993 statement and
 
Kaui's October 1994 statement to police was harmless beyond a
 
reasonable doubt.
 
(3) Appellant alleges the State made two improper 
comments on rebuttal. "Prosecutorial misconduct warrants a new 
trial or the setting aside of a guilty verdict only where the 
actions of the prosecutor have caused prejudice to the 
defendant's right to a fair trial." State v. McGriff, 76 Hawai� i 
148, 158, 871 P.2d 782, 792 (1994). As a threshold matter, this court must first determine whether the prosecutor indeed 
committed misconduct. State v. Kiakona, 110 Hawai� i 450, 458, 
134 P.3d 616, 624 (App. 2006). 
First, Appellant complains that the prosecutor
 
misstated the law on extended sentencing, by not informing the
 jury during rebuttal that there must be a necessity to imprison
 
Appellant for the safety of the public. However, when closing
 
arguments are read in their entirety, the prosecutor clearly
 
informed the jury of the two findings required before a defendant
 
can receive enhanced sentencing under § 706-661.
 
Second, Appellant argues that the prosecutor's 
rhetorical question, "what chance does [the decedent] have in 
life" was improper because it diverted jurors' attention from the 
issues at hand: Appellant's criminal history and whether his 
extended imprisonment was necessary to protect the public. The 
defense counsel did not object to the statement at trial, so we 
review for plain error. See Rodrigues, 113 Hawai� i at 47, 147 
P.3d at 831. The State contends the remarks rebutted defense counsel's argument that Appellant "never had a fair chance in 
life" because his father was abusive. Prosecutors may "respond 
to comments by defense counsel which invite or provoke 
response[.]" State v. Mars, 116 Hawai� i 125, 142, 170 P.3d 861, 
878 (App. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting People v. Sutton, 631 N.E.2d 1326, 1335 (Ill. App. Ct. 1994)). 
The California Supreme Court has said that, even before a jury 
contemplating a death sentence, "it is not misconduct for a 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
prosecutor to ask the jury to show a defendant the same lack of 
sympathy the defendant showed the victims." People v. Brady, 236 
P.3d 312, 343 (Cal. 2010) (citing People v. Kennedy, 115 P.3d 472 (Cal. 2005)). We read defense counsel's closing statement and 
the prosecutor's rebuttal in a similar vein and conclude that the 
prosecutor did not commit misconduct. Given the latitude that 
prosecutors have on rebuttal, Mars, 115 Hawai� i at 142, 170 P.3d 
at 878, we are unconvinced that the prosecutor's brief reference to Wilcox affected the "fairness, integrity, or public reputation 
of judicial proceedings" such that it warrants reversal as plain 
error. Rodrigues, 113 Hawai� i at 47, 147 P.3d at 831 (internal 
quotation marks and citation omitted). 
(4) Appellant's final argument on appeal is that the 
circuit court erred in giving two instructions relating to parole. These instructions told the jury that the Hawai� i 
Paroling Authority would hold a hearing within six months of a person's commitment to custody, after which it would fix the 
minimum term of imprisonment before the prisoner shall become 
eligible for parole. The court further told the jury that 
[n]o parole shall be granted unless it appears to the
Hawai�i Paroling Authority that there is a reasonable
probability that the prisoner concerned will live and remainat liberty without violating the law and that the prisoner'srelease is not incompatible with the welfare and safety ofsociety. 
Appellant argues that the instructions "misled and 
confused the jury by leading the jury to believe that [Appellant] 
may serve a shorter sentence than twenty years, if the jury did 
not impose an extended term of imprisonment." To the contrary, 
the instructions accurately state the procedures for determining 
the minimum term of imprisonment, as provided in HRS § 706-669, 
and clarify that the Hawai� i Paroling Authority, not the jury or 
the court, would determine the minimum time that Appellant must serve. Thus, the instructions are distinguishable from those 
held to be erroneous in Lovely v. United States, 169 F.2d 386 
(4th Cir. 1948), which Appellant cites, in that the circuit 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
court's instruction here does not tell the jury how much time
 
Appellant must serve before becoming eligible for parole.
 
Furthermore, the circuit court instructed the jurors, 
"You must not discuss or consider the subject of any action that 
the Hawai� i Paroling Authority may or may not take in your 
deliberations of the facts at issue in this hearing." A jury is presumed to have followed the court's instructions. State v. 
Smith, 91 Hawai� i 450, 461, 984 P.2d 1276, 1287 (App. 1999). 
For the reasons stated above, the June 22, 2009
 
judgment of conviction and sentence, entered by the Circuit Court
