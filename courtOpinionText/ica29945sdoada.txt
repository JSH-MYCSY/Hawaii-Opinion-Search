On appeal, Kathleen asserts that the Family Court erred
 
in concluding that post-judgment interest began to accrue on the
 $30,582.00 equalization payment that she owed to Defendant-
Appellee Jeffrey A. Tretsven ("Jeffrey") on November 6, 2002,
 because (1) the November 6, 2002 Order Re: Remand Conference
 ("November 6, 2002 Order") was not a judgment upon which
 statutory interest could accrue pursuant to Hawaii Revised
 Statutes ("HRS") § 478-3; (2) the November 6, 2002 Order was not

an order or judgment under Hawai' i Family Court Rules Rule 54(a); 
(3) the November 6, 2002 Order did not determine a sum to be
 
owing which was ascertained and liquidated to a fixed and certain
 amount; and (4) the court failed to consider the doctrines of
 estoppel and waiver. Kathleen further contends that (5) the
 Family Court erred in concluding that her Motion to Alter or
 Amend Order Motion for Reconsideration of Order Re: Plaintiff's
 Motion to Alter or Amend Order, filed July 17, 2009 ("July 17,
 2009 Motion to Alter or Amend") was untimely. 
In his answering brief, Jeffrey contends that the
 
Family Court's jurisdiction to amend the property division and
 debt allocation provisions on remand lapsed one year after this
 court issued its Notice and Judgment on Appeal on October 30,
 2002. Consequently, Jeffrey argues, the only valid post-divorce
 order that the Family Court entered modifying the parties'
 divorce decree provisions concerning the division and disposition
 of property and allocation of debts was the November 6, 2002
 Order. Kathleen argues that Jeffrey is judicially estopped from
 arguing that the amended decree never needed to be filed.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Kathleen's points on appeal as follows:
 
The Family Court abused its discretion by ordering 
that, pursuant to HRS § 478-3, interest would begin to run on Kathleen's equalization obligation from November 6, 2002. See 
Metcalf v. Voluntary Emps.' Benefit Ass'n of Hawai' i, 99 Hawai' i 
53, 57, 52 P.3d 823, 827 (2002) ("This court reviews rulings on interest pursuant to HRS §[] 478-3 . . . for abuse of discretion."). Under HRS § 478-3, "[i]nterest at the rate of ten per cent a year, and no more, shall be allowed on any judgment recovered before any court in the State, in any civil suit." H
AW. REV. STAT. § 478-3 (2008) (emphasis added). "Judgment," as 
used in the statute, refers to a "money judgment" — a final and appealable decree or order that requires the payment of money or its equivalent. See Kamaole Resort Twenty-One v. Ficke Hawaiian 
Invs., Inc., 60 Haw. 413, 419–20, 591 P.2d 104, 108–09 (1979).

The November 6, 2002 Order was entered in response to
 
this court's decision in Tretsven v. Tretsven, No. 24061, 2002 WL
 
31186213 (Haw. Ct. App. Sept. 20, 2002) (mem.) ("Tretsven I").
 
Jeffrey had appealed from the November 20, 2000 Divorce Decree,
 
which, among other things, ended Kathleen and Jeffrey's marriage
 and divided and distributed their property and debts. The court
 in Tretsven I held that the Family Court's property-and-debt
 analysis was lacking, vacated the Division and Distribution of
 Property and Debts section of the Divorce Decree, and remanded
 for reconsideration with instructions for the Family Court to,
 among other things, "[d]etermine the Partnership Model Division
 by finding the assets, debts, and values of the parties and
 categorizing those assets, debts, and values." 
The November 6, 2002 Order stated that it had orally
 
divided the estate of the parties. It did not, however, state
 how the estate of the parties was to be divided. Noting that it
 did not intend to deviate from marital partnership principles,
 the Family Court held that Kathleen "shall be required to make an
 equalization payment of $33,383.00" to Jeffrey. The Family Court
 ordered Jeffrey's attorney "to prepare an amended decree that
 shall be submitted within fourteen (14) days." 
Despite the Family Court's order, an amended decree was
 
not filed for more than six years, on March 9, 2009 ("First
 Amended Divorce Decree"). On April 13, 2009, Kathleen filed a
 Motion to Alter or Amend Order, arguing that, among other things,
 the First Amended Divorce Decree contained a mathematical error
 insofar that the equalization payment should have been $30,582,
 not $33,383. On April 15, 2009, Jeffrey filed a Motion for
 Relief from Judgment or Order Due to Mistake, arguing that, among
 other things, the First Amended Divorce Decree should have
 provided for the accrual of 10% interest on the equalization
 obligation from November 6, 2002, pursuant to HRS § 478-3.
 
At the April 21, 2009 hearing on these motions,
 
Kathleen disputed that statutory interest should run from
 November 6, 2002, contending that the November 6, 2002 Order was
 merely an interim order and that an amended divorce decree had
 not been filed until March 9, 2009. The Family Court disagreed

with Kathleen and, stating that the November 6, 2002 Order is
 
"about the closest we're going to get to a final judgment[,]"
 concluded that the November 6, 2002 Order was "appealable as a
 final order." While agreeing with Kathleen that a mathematical
 error had been made, the Family Court found in the June 16, 2009
 Order that HRS § 478-3 "would apply regarding interest on the
 judgment. As such, [i]nterest shall accrue on the $30,582 at the
 rate of 10% per annum from November 6, 2002." On June 23, 2009,
 the Family Court filed a second amended divorce decree reflecting
 this finding.
 
"Hawai'i divorce cases involve a maximum of four 
discrete parts: (1) dissolution of the marriage; (2) spousal support; (3) child custody, visitation, and support; and (4) division of assets and debts." Chen v. Hoeflinger, 127 Hawai' i 
346, 354–55, 279 P.3d 11, 19–20 (App. 2012). "Part (4) is only final and appealable when the marriage is formally dissolved and when the family court fully and finally divides and distributes the parties' property [and debts] within its jurisdiction." Id. 
Here, the November 6, 2002 Order was not a judgment 
within the meaning of HRS § 478-3 because it did not divide and distribute the parties' property and debts, as this court ordered the Family Court to do in Tretsven I, and was, thus, not appealable.
3 The fact that the Family Court orally divided the 
parties' estate at the November 6, 2002 hearing does not change the result. KNG Corp. v. Kim, 107 Hawai' i 73, 77, 110 P.3d 397, 
401 (2005) (oral decisions are not appealable). Although the November 6, 2002 Order referenced the fact that the Family Court had orally divided the property and was adopting such division, it did not in any way reduce to writing the specific division of 
3
 Jeffrey argues that the November 6, 2002 Order is appealable
because "Kathleen was to pay Jeffrey $33,383 as a property division
equalization payment. The other property division and debt allocation
provisions of the Divorce Decree remained unchanged." Nothing in the November
6, 2002 Order, however, indicates that, except for the equalization payment,
the Family Court divided the parties' property and debts exactly as it did in
the November 20, 2000 Divorce Decree.

property.4 Therefore, the November 6, 2002 Order was not final
 
and appealable and the Family Court abused its discretion by
 
ordering that interest began to accrue on November 6, 2002.5
 
Because the Family Court committed its error in the
 
June 16, 2009 Order, the remaining points of error, including
 point of error 5 relating to the timeliness of the July 17, 2009
 Motion to Alter or Amend, are moot.
 
Therefore, the portion of the June 16, 2009 Order Re:
 
Plaintiff's Motion to Alter or Amend Order, Filed April 13, 2009
 and Defendant's Motion for Relief from Judgment or Order Due to
 Mistake, Filed April 15, 2009 relating to statutory interest is
 vacated, and we remand the case for further proceedings.

 The November 6, 2002 Order stated: 
Upon review of the parties['] respective position statements
and consistent with the memorandum opinion of the
Intermediate Court of Appeals, the court orally divided the
estate of the parties, and intending no deviation from
marital/partnership property division principles, adopts
such division and wife shall be required to make an
equalization payment of $33,383.00 to husband. [Jeffrey's
attorney] to prepare an amended decree that shall be
submitted within fourteen (14) days.

 Jeffrey argues that the Family Court lacked jurisdiction to
redivide and distribute the parties' property and debts pursuant to HRS § 580­56(d). We reject this argument because HRS § 580-56(d) only limits "aspouse's right to dower or curtesy in his or her deceased former spouse's
estate." Riethbrock v. Lange, 128 Hawai' i 1, 3, 282 P.3d 543, 545 (2012).
