    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
mandatory minimum of three years and four months to be served. 
On appeal, White argues that it was erroneous for the
 
Circuit Court to deny his March 6, 2009 Motion for Judgment of
 
Acquittal/Dismissal and/or New Trial (Motion for New Trial)
 because the jury impermissibly shifted to him the burden of
 proof, and thereby denied him of his right to a fair trial. 
After careful review of the issues raised, arguments
 
advanced, applicable law, and the record in this case, we resolve
 White's point of error as follows:
 
White's contention that the jury shifted the burden of
 
proof is based on a post-trial conversation between White's
 counsel (Counsel) and the jury foreperson. According to
 Counsel's declaration in support of the Motion for New Trial, the
 foreperson said, among other things, that "the jury wanted
 [White] to give them more evidence of effort, such as whether he
 asked friends or relatives about the date in question (i.e.
 alibi)[.]" In a subsequently filed memorandum, White added that
 the foreperson explicitly stated that "if [White] only did so, it
 might have made a difference, especially with the male members of
 the jury[.]" Counsel described the foreperson's comments as "a
 summary of sorts, that's the way I interpret it, of what went on
 with the jury." 
Counsel's representations do not establish burden
 
shifting on the part of the jury or an abuse of discretion on the
 Circuit Court's part in refusing to grant a new trial. A single
 juror's contention that "the jury wanted" anything, or that
 additional testimony "might have made a difference," without
 further explanation or context is indicative of little. The
 question we are left to answer, then, is whether, based on what
 was said by the foreperson, the Circuit Court erred in failing to
 further interrogate the jury.
 
When a defendant in a criminal case claims that he or
 
she was deprived of the right to a fair trial by an impartial

jury,
 
the initial step for the trial court to take . . . is to
determine whether the nature of the alleged deprivation
rises to the level of being substantially prejudicial. If
 it does not rise to such a level, the trial court is under
no duty to interrogate the jury. . . . And whether it does
rise to the level of substantial prejudice . . . is
ordinarily a question committed to the trial court's
discretion[.]
 
State v. Furutani, 76 Hawai 'i 172, 180, 873 P.2d 51, 59 (1994) 
(quoting State v. Keliiholokai, 58 Haw. 356, 359, 569 P.2d 891,
 
895 (1977)) (original brackets omitted).
 
The defendant bears the initial burden of making a
prima facie showing of a deprivation that "could
substantially prejudice [his or her] right to a fair trial"
by an impartial jury. [State v. Williamson, 72 Haw. 97,
102, 807 P.2d 593, 596 (1991)]; cf. Lopez v. State, 527
N.E.2d 1119, 1130 (Ind. 1988) ("A defendant seeking a
hearing on juror misconduct must first present some
specific, substantial evidence showing a juror was possibly
biased." (citation omitted)). But once a rebuttable
 presumption is raised, the burden of proving harmlessness
falls squarely on the prosecution.
 
Furutani, 76 Hawai 'i at 181, 873 P.2d at 60. 
Our duty, then, on review of the actions taken by the
trial court on this issue, giving due deference to the trial
court's discretion, is to make an independent examination of
the totality of the circumstances to determine if there are
any indications that the defendant's trial was not
fundamentally fair.
 
Keliiholokai, 58 Haw. at 360, 569 P.2d at 895 (description of
 
defendant's prior convictions in a local newspaper report should
 have prompted voir dire of the jury to determine exposure and
 effect).
 
The fact that White testified at trial is central to
 
our analysis. Unlike the Furutani case, where the defendant had
 exercised his constitutional right to not testify, and where jury
 members were alleged to have commented critically on that
 decision, White here testified. He was subject to the same tests
 of credibility as any other witness. See State v. Plichta , 116
 
Hawai
'i 200, 217, 172 P.3d 512, 529 (2007) (citing State v. 
Pokini, 57 Haw. 17, 22, 548 P.2d 1397, 1400 (1976)). In
 addition, Counsel himself characterized the foreperson's comments
 as a mere "summary" of "what went on with the jury."

   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
We concur with the Circuit Court that the foreperson's 
comments "[go] to a consideration of the weight and credibility 
of the defendant's testimony, which is the province of the jury." "When the [defendant] testifies on the main trial, it is not error for the jury to discuss his failure to produce other evidence in his behalf." Johnson v. State, 366 S.W.2d 560, 562 
(Tex. Crim. App. 1963) (affirming denial of motion for new trial when juror commented that it was unusual that the defendant, who had testified, did not call additional witnesses to testify on her behalf); see also State v. Hauge, 103 Hawai
'i 38, 56, 79 P.3d 
131, 149 (2003) (prosecution's questions and comments about defendant's failure to "explain away" DNA evidence constituted permissible commentary on the evidence); cf. State v. Mainaaupo, 117 Hawai
'i 235, 257, 178 P.3d 1, 23 (2008) ("the prosecution may 
invoke the adverse inference against the defendant for his failure to call a witness when it would be natural under the circumstances for the defendant to call the witness and when the comments do not suggest to the jury that it was the defendant's burden to produce proof by explaining the absence of witnesses or evidence" (quoting State v. Padilla, 57 Haw. 150, 160, 552 P.2d 357, 364 (1976) and U.S. v. Bautista, 23 F.3d 726, 733 (2d Cir. 1994) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)).
"The prosecution may 'comment on the state of the 
evidence, the defendant's failure to call logical witnesses, and/or to present material evidence without shifting the burden of proof to the defendant.'" Hauge, 103 Hawai
'i at 55, 79 P.3d 
at 148 (quoting State v. Napulou, 85 Hawai 'i 49, 59, 936 P.2d 
1297, 1307 (App. 1997)) (brackets and ellipsis omitted). The foreperson's observation that the defendant's credibility might have been enhanced by evidencing concern for his whereabouts on the date in question is of similar import. Therefore, the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in finding that White did not satisfy his burden of making a prima facie showing of a deprivation that could substantially prejudice his right to a fair trial by an impartial jury. 
Therefore,
