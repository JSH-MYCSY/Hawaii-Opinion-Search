SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Jason K. Andrews (Andrews) appeals
 
pro se from the June 16, 2009 Order Denying in Part Defendant's
 
Petition to Vacate, Set Aside or Correct Judgment or to Release
 
Petitioner from Custody and the July 17, 2009 Findings of Fact
 
and Conclusions of Law Granting in Part and Denying in Part
 
Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release
 
Petitioner from Custody (Rule 40 Orders) issued by the Circuit
 
Court of the Third Circuit (Circuit Court).1
 
Andrews pled no contest and was convicted of: (1)
 
Count I - Negligent Injury in the First Degree in violation of
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-705(1) (1993); (2) Count III
 
-No No-Fault Insurance in violation of HRS § 431:10C-104(a)
 
(Supp. 2002); (3) Count IV - Driving While License Suspended in
 
violation of HRS § 286-132 (Supp. 2002); (4) Count VI - Operating
 
The Honorable Elizabeth A. Strance presided.

a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OUI) in violation
 
of HRS § 291E-61(a)(2) (Supp. 2002); and (5) Count VII ­
Accidents Involving Death or Serious Bodily Injury in violation
 
of HRS § 291C-12(a) (1993) with Judge Ronald Ibarra presiding. 
The plea was entered based upon a plea agreement which included
 
the following language: "in return for my no contest plea to the
 
charges on page 1, the State agrees to dismiss Duty upon Striking
 
Unattended Vehicle or Other Property, 291C-15 and Registration
 
Violation, 286-52(b)" and "[t]he State will recommend five years
 
probation and retain the option to recommend up to one year in
 
jail as a condition of probation. The State may argue against a
 
deferred imposition of sentence and State reserves the right to
 
recommend any reasonable condition of probation."
 
No direct appeal was taken. However, Andrews filed and 
the Circuit Court (with Judge Elizabeth Strance presiding) ruled 
upon two motions to reduce the sentence under Rule 35 of the 
Hawai'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP). Andrews also filed a 
petition under HRPP Rule 40 (First Rule 40 Petition) and an 
appeal from the First Rule 40 Petition in S. Ct. 27668. 
Thereafter, Andrews filed another HRPP Rule 40 Petition (Second 
Rule 40 Petition), which is the subject of the instant appeal. 
Andrews asserts in his points of error that: (1) his
 
[deferred acceptance of no contest] DANC Plea was not
 
constitutionally valid because he did not proffer his plea
 
knowingly and voluntarily when Judge Ibarra failed to inform him
 
that he was not eligible for the deferral under HRS § 853-4(2)(A)
 
and (5)(A), and due to ineffective assistance of trial counsel
 
for not informing him that he was not eligible for the deferral;
 
(2) the Circuit Court erred when it failed to rule on his HRPP
 
Rule 32(d) motion to withdraw his plea or for specific
 
performance; (3) the Circuit Court "disregarded the fact that the
 
maximum terms of imprisonment that Judge Ibarra informed Andrews
 
he was eligible to receive was incorrect and therefore making the
 
2     
    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
plea agreement void; (4) the Hawai' i Paroling Authority's (HPA's) 
"guideline violation" in the "amended minimum term order" (Third 
HPA Minimum Term Order) deprived him of due process and equal 
protection; (5) the Circuit Court failed to provide the "proper 
remedy" and erred "in its remedy for correction of the violation 
of the terms of the plea agreement by the prosecution, as the HPA 
could no longer give a level I or II classification for Andrews's 
minimum term of imprisonment due to the fact that Andrews had 
already served the maximum amount of time in both of these 
categories"; and (6) the Circuit Court erred when it concluded 
that HRS § 707-705(1) was not a lesser included offense of 
HRS § 291C-12(a). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
2
submitted by the parties,  and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Andrews's points of error as follows:
 
(1) The Circuit Court did not err in denying Andrews's 
claim for relief based on the validity of his DANC plea. 
Under 
HRS § 853-4, a DANC plea is precluded on offenses that are non­probationable or involve an enhanced repeat-offender sentencing 
structure, on the basis that such a deferral would frustrate the 
purpose of such sentencing schemes. See State v. Hamili, 87 
Hawai'i 102, 104-07, 952 P.2d 390, 392-95 (1998); see also State 
v. Tom, 69 Haw. 602, 604, 752 P.2d 597, 598 (1988). Thus, a DANC
 
plea was not permitted for the following offenses: Count III ­
3
No Insurance, in violation of HRS § 431:10C-104(a);  Count IV ­
2 The parties are cautioned that facts referenced in the briefs must be
supported by record citations pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure
(HRAP) Rule 28(b) and (c). Indeed, generally, facts outside the record are
precluded. The parties are also cautioned that record citations should
accurately direct the court to where in the record fact assertions aresupported. Future failure to comply with the rules may result in sanctions. 
3 See HRS § 431:10C-117(a)(5) (Supp. 2005), which reflects escalating
 
penalties for "multiple convictions for driving without a valid motor vehicle
insurance policy[.]"

    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Driving While License Suspended, in violation of HRS § 286-132;4
 
and Count VI - Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an
 
Intoxicant, in violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(2).5 However, the
 
record reasonably reflects that Andrews did not enter into the
 plea with concerns about any of those non-felony charges. In
 
Andrews's testimony at the hearing on the Second Rule 40 Petition
 
he stated (emphasis added):
 
If he would have told me I was not eligible for it, I
would have greatly reconsidered my changing the plea. It
definitely would have affected my decision-making. Because I
work in real estate, or I did work in real estate at the
time, and was pursuing a license, and that was a motivating
factor for me to accept the plea. Because with a felony
record on my back, that would not be . . .
 
And I also believe -- I’m not sure if I’m correctly
interpreting it –- but I don’t think I’m eligible for it
because of the serious injury charge as well, and the fact
that I already had a deferred acceptance of no contest plea.
But definitely under law, all the research that I’ve read is
that under DUI, it’s not available. That’s a matter of law.
 In State v. Kimsel, 109 Hawai' i 50, 58-59, 122 P.3d 1148, 
1156-57 (App. 2005), which is relied on by Andrews, this court
 
stated, in relevant part:
 
In the light of Kimsel's stipulated and unchallenged
testimony - 'that had he . . . been informed at the time
that he changed his plea that he was statutorily ineligible
for deferral, he would not have changed his plea but rather
he would have proceeded to trial' - the prejudice is plain,
and we conclude the circuit court abused its discretion in
 denying the Rule 40 motion.
 
Although Andrews similarly asserts "that had he known
 
that he was not eligible for a DANC Plea he would have insisted
 
on going to trial", the Circuit Court could have reasonably
 
inferred from Andrews's testimony that Andrews was concerned only
 
with the felony charges that would have resulted in a felony
 
record, and that a record with non-felony offenses as a
 
4 See HRS § 286-136(b) (Supp. 2005), which provides for an enhanced
 
sentence on violation of HRS § 286-132 upon "two or more prior convictions for
the same offense in the preceding five-year period."
 
5 See HRS § 291E-61(b) (Supp. 2005), which precludes probation and
 
provides for escalating penalties for multiple offenses.
 
4       
    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
consequence of denial of the DANC plea and conviction on the OUI,
 
6
No Insurance, and Driving While Suspended  was not material to
his decision to enter his plea, and thus, any failure of the
 
Circuit Court to advise him of such ineligibility was harmless.
 
As to the felony charges of Negligent Injury and
 
Accidents Involving Death or Serious Bodily Injury, the offenses
 
7
are probationable,  so HRS § 853-4(5) does not preclude a
deferral. HRS § 853-4(2) precludes a deferral where the offense
 
charged is a felony that involves the intentional, knowing, or
 
reckless bodily injury, substantial bodily injury, or serious
 
bodily injury of another person." The Negligent Injury offense
 
involves 
negligent serious bodily injury of another under
 
HRS § 707-705 (1993), rather than "intentional, knowing, or
 reckless . . . serious bodily injury" under HRS § 853-4. 
Similarly, HRS § 291C-12 (Supp. 2002, unchanged through 2007;
 
amended 2008) (Accidents Involving Death or Serious Bodily
 
Injury) references "[t]he driver of any vehicle involved in an
 
accident resulting in serious bodily injury", which relates in
 
this case to the negligent serious bodily injury alleged in the
 
Negligent Injury charge. Hence, a DANC plea is not prohibited in
 
either of those felony offenses. Consequently, the Circuit Court
 
did not err in denying this claim for relief.
 
(2) Andrews contends that the Circuit Court erred when
 
it failed to rule on his motion to withdraw his plea under HRPP
 
Rule 32(d) and for specific performance of the plea agreement. 
Andrews does not present a specific argument on this point, and
 
only makes a bare assertion in the title of his argument that
 
6 No Insurance, Driving While Suspended, and OUI in this case are
not felony offenses. See HRS §§ 701-107 (1993), 431:10C-104(c),
431:10C-117(a), 286-132, 286-136, and 291E-61(b).
 
7 HRS § 706-622 (1993) requires probation as the sentence on a felony
where imprisonment is not ordered; HRS § 707-705(2) classifies Negligent
Injury in the First Degree as a class C felony; and HRS § 291C-12(b),
classifies Accidents Involving Death or Serious Bodily Injury as a class B
felony.
 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"Andrews was substantially prejudiced by the denying of his Rule
 
32(d) motion and Judge Strance [sic] Failure to Answer his Motion
 
for Specific Performance", and is deemed waived, as provided
 
under HRAP Rule 28(b)(7). This point is also waived because the
 
July 30, 2009 motion referenced by Andrews was filed after the
 
July 17, 2009 Circuit Court order ruling on the Second Rule 40
 
Petition, thus was not presented or argued to the Circuit Court
 
as part of the Second Rule 40 Petition, and cannot be raised on
 
appeal in the first instance. State v. Naeole, 62 Haw. 563, 570,
 
617 P.2d 820, 826 (1980).
 
(3) In his third point of error, Andrews asserts that
 
no potential for consecutive sentencing existed, and yet the plea
 form reflected maximum terms including consecutive and extended
 
terms. Andrews did not properly raise this issue as part of his
 
Second Rule 40 Petition. Although Andrews claimed in his Second
 
Rule 40 Petition that the plea agreement was invalid, the basis
 
for the claim was that the Circuit Court and counsel failed to
 
advise him that he was ineligible for a DANC plea and was not for
 
error in articulating the maximum terms of imprisonment. This
 
issue was not raised below and will not be considered for the
 
first time on appeal. Naeole, 62 Haw. at 570, 617 P.2d at 826.
 
(4) Andrews contends that the HPA violated its
 
guidelines in the Third HPA Minimum Term Order and, therefore,
 
deprived him of due process and equal protection. This argument
 
was not raised in the Second Rule 40 Petition. Thus, the Circuit
 
Court did not address it. Consequently, this issue is waived. 
(5) Andrews asserts that the Circuit Court did not
 
provide the proper remedy, and erred in its chosen remedy to cure
 
the breach of the plea agreement, because the HPA could no longer
 
give him a level I or II minimum term of imprisonment due to the
 
fact that Andrews had already served the "maximum" amount of time
 
in both of these minimum term categories.
 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Andrews fails to indicate where in the record he
 
brought this issue to the attention of the Circuit Court. 
Andrews could have raised his contention, for example, at the
 
time of the Circuit Court's oral ruling. Andrews does not raise
 
ineffectiveness of his counsel on the Second Rule 40 Petition in
 
failing to raise this issue. Thus, Andrews has waived this
 
point.
 
(6) Andrews claims his conviction subjects him to
 
double jeopardy because "[i]t was impossible to commit the
 
greater offense without first commiting [sic] the lesser as it
 
was also a continuing course of action." 
It appears that his claim is waived for failure to
 
raise it prior and failure to overcome the presumption of a
 
knowing and voluntary waiver. Even if not waived, however, the
 
Circuit Court did not err in denying this claim for relief. 
The offense of Accidents Involving Death or Serious
 
Bodily Injury (a) includes facts that are not required in
 
Negligent Injury, (b) is not an attempted Negligent Injury, and
 
(c) differs in significantly more respects than the degree of
 
injury or level of culpability. As such, a violation of
 
HRS § 701-109(1)(a) and (4), Accidents Involving Death or Serious
 
Bodily Injury is not an included offense of Negligent Injury in
 
the First Degree.
 
Additionally, Andrews's actions in the commission of
 
the two offenses do not qualify as a continuing course of conduct
 
under HRS § 701-109(1)(e) where the offense of Negligent Injury
 
in the First Degree was completed when Andrews caused serious
 
bodily injury while driving his motor vehicle negligently. Any
 
continued driving of his motor vehicle which then resulted in his
 
failure to remain at the scene of the accident, and the offense
 
of Accidents Involving Death or Serious Bodily Injury, was not
 
necessary for the Negligent Injury charge. State v. Hoopii 68
 
Haw. 246, 251, 710 P.2d 1193, 1197 (1985). Accordingly,
 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
conviction of both offenses does not violate double jeopardy and
 
a plea that included both offenses was not invalid.
 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's Rule 40 Orders
 
are affirmed.
