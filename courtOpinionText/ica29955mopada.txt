I. BACKGROUND
 
This case arises out of Selwyn's December 19, 2005
 
report to Officer Ivan Tamura (Tamura) that, on November 2, 2005,
 
Chad Sohriakoff (Sohriakoff) sexually assaulted her inside of her

 The Honorable Greg K. Nakamura presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
apartment at Kamuela Senior Housing (Kamuela Housing) between 
5:00-5:15 p.m. At the time of the alleged assault Sohriakoff was 
an employee of Hawai' i Affordable Properties (HAP), a company 
owned by his parents. As an employee of HAP, Sohriakoff was the 
property manager of Kamuela Housing. Sohriakoff testified that 
while he had met with Selwyn at Kamuela Housing on that day, he 
did not interact with Selwyn after 4:45 p.m., when he left the 
complex, and that he did not assault her. 
Selwyn moved into Kamuela Housing in January of 2005. 
Although the apartment was brand new when she moved into it,
 
Selwyn testified that she soon began experiencing significant
 
problems with the unit, including a malfunctioning refrigerator,
 
a malfunctioning smoke alarm, and a roach infestation. In
 
response to these problems, Selwyn claims she contacted Dan Cook
 
(Cook), an on-site resident manager, Sohriakoff, and Keith Kato
 
(Kato), the project director. 
Selwyn testified that, on November 2, 2005, Sohriakoff
 
arrived early in the morning to help her with the problems
 
affecting her unit. But, because she was not expecting him and
 
had already planned to run errands that day, they both agreed to
 
contact Selwyn's caseworker, Nidhi Chabora (Chabora), and
 
schedule a meeting with all parties present for a later time.
 
According to Selwyn, Sohriakoff returned to her
 
apartment later that day with a "big grin on his face saying,
 
'You know, I really wanna help you, I wanna help you, I wanna
 
make things better for you here.'" Sohriakoff then pushed his
 
way into her apartment, locked the door behind him, and then
 
began "using foul language." Selwyn claims he then started
 
grabbing her breast very hard and backed her up onto her bed. 
Selwyn testified that she yelled at Sohriakoff to "get out" and
 
that "you cannot touch me like this." Once on her bed,
 
Sohriakoff allegedly got on top of her, held her down by her
 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
biceps, and began "slobbering" on her. According to Selwyn's
 
report to Tamura, the assault occurred between 5:00-5:15 p.m. 
Selwyn testified that, after Sohriakoff left her
 
apartment, she called Chabora and her two best girlfriends. 
Selwyn further claimed she called the police but nobody showed
 
up. Evidence also indicates that at 5:33 p.m., moments after the
 
alleged assault, Selwyn sent an email to Kato and HAP. In the
 
email, Selwyn complained about Sohriakoff's persistent knocking
 
on her door that day but did not mention Sohriakoff sexually
 
assaulting her.
 
Selwyn testified that, on November 7, 2005, she again
 
contacted the police. Selwyn stateed that she expressed to
 
dispatch that she had been sexually assaulted by her property
 
manager and requested a female officer. According to Selwyn,
 
dispatch replied that no female officers were available but that
 
all officers were trained to handle situations of sexual assault. 
On November 7, 2005, Officer John Gandolf (Gandolf) and Officer
 
William Vickery (Vickery) were dispatched to Selwyn's residence. 
Officers Gandolf and Vickery testified that, prior to
 
arrival at Kamuela Housing on November 7, 2005, dispatch had not
 
informed them of the nature of Selwyn's call. Usually, when the
 
nature of a call is as serious as a sexual assault, the
 
dispatcher asks the reporting officers to contact dispatch before
 
heading to the location of the call. In the present case, the
 
officers testified that dispatch did not include such
 
instructions when they were told to report to Kamuela Housing. 
Furthermore, Gandolf testified that, when the officers arrived at
 
Kamuela Housing and spoke with Selwyn, she did not mention
 
anything about a sexual assault. Instead, Selwyn complained
 
about a neighbor of hers and an unrelated occurrence on November
 
3, 2005. Officer Vickery testified that he did not know until
 
after he was "all done" that the dispatcher had coded Selwyn's
 
call as a "sexual assault." 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Selwyn testified that on November 7, 2005, after
 
contacting the police, Selwyn also called a rape crisis hotline. 
The hotline advised and aided Selwyn in seeking a temporary
 
restraining order (TRO) against Sohriakoff. In December of 2005,
 
Selwyn was granted a TRO against Sohriakoff. On March 1, 2006,
 
Selwyn attended the first TRO hearing and testified that
 
Sohriakoff had sexually assaulted her. Prior to the second
 
hearing, which was scheduled for March 29, 2006, Selwyn
 
reportedly "received several serious death threats and . . .
 
hang-up calls." Consequently, claiming that she felt threatened,
 
Selwyn failed to appear at the second TRO hearing and her case
 
against Sohriakoff was dismissed. Selwyn testified that she
 
reported the death threats to the F.B.I. but could not recall the
 
name of the agent she spoke with or whether she had complained to
 
the F.B.I.'s internal affairs regarding how her complaint was
 
handled. 
After not hearing back from the police regarding her
 
report to Officers Gandolf and Vickery, Selwyn claims she
 
contacted the police to determine the status of her case. 
According to Selwyn, the police records department replied that
 
they had not received her report and advised her to make a second
 
report. Then, on December 19, 2005, Selwyn spoke with Officer
 
Tamura regarding the incident on November 2, 2005, and they filed
 
a report. 
Selwyn further testified that at some point she met
 
with a prosecutor named Janet Garcia (Garcia) and discussed
 
potentially prosecuting Sohriakoff. Selwyn asserted that
 
criminal charges were actually filed against Sohriakoff, but that
 
she eventually withdrew her complaint because her health was 
4  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
deteriorating and she feared the death threats she had
 
received.2/
 
Sohriakoff testified that the events of November 2,
 
2005, occurred as follows. He arrived at Kamuela Housing at
 
approximately 2:00 p.m. to "deal with some ongoing issues on the
 
property." After speaking with the resident manager at the
 
property, Sohriakoff went to Selwyn's apartment to discuss the
 
issues with her unit. Sohriakoff claimed that Selwyn was
 
unwilling to meet because of some errands she needed to run so
 
they agreed to meet in Selwyn's apartment at 4:00 p.m. 
Sohriakoff did not enter Selwyn's apartment at this time. In the
 
meantime, Sohriakoff spoke with other tenants of Kamuela Housing.
 
Sohriakoff further testified that, based on the
 
conversations he had with the other tenants, an issue regarding
 
the safety of the tenants required a follow-up with Selwyn before
 
their 4:00 p.m. meeting time. Sohriakoff claims that after
 
knocking on Selwyn's apartment door, Selwyn again told him that
 
she did not want to speak with him so he left without entering
 
into Selwyn's apartment. 
Sometime afterwards, Sohriakoff testified that while
 
conducting errands around Kamuela Housing he noticed three
 
tenants arguing with Selwyn. According to Sohriakoff's
 
testimony, Selwyn returned to her apartment as he approached the
 
altercation. Sohriakoff claimed that after asking the other
 
tenants to calm down, he followed Selwyn to her apartment to
 
discuss what had occurred and knocked on her door "a little after
 
4 [p.m.]." When Selwyn did not respond, Sohriakoff claimed that
 
he spoke with the other tenants a little longer and left Kamuela
 
Housing at approximately 4:45 p.m. 
2/
 In its answering brief, the State asserts that no criminal charges
were ever filed against Sohriakoff concerning the alleged sexual assault.
However, there is no indication that evidence countering Selwyn's testimony
was offered at trial.
 
5  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The next day, November 3, 2005, Sohriakoff wrote up
 
violation notices against Selwyn. On November 18 or 19, 2005,
 
Sohriakoff sent Selwyn a "lease termination notice" which
 
indicated HAP's intent to not renew Selwyn's lease on Jan 5 or 6,
 
2006. Sohriakoff insisted that the notice was not in any way
 
retaliatory and was decided by the staff at HAP. 
The testimony of three other residents of Kamuela
 
Housing was presented. Pricilia Oana (Oana) lived across from
 
Selwyn's building and could see the structure from her front
 
door. In her testimony, Oana explained that she noticed
 
Sohriakoff approach Selwyn's door on two separate occasions on
 
November 2, 2005. On neither occasion did Oana see Sohriakoff
 
enter into Selwyn's apartment. Oana also testified that she
 
witnessed Sohriakoff leave Kamuela Housing some time between
 
4:30-6:30 p.m. Oana had previously told police that she
 
witnessed Sohriakoff leave between 4:30-5:00 p.m. After Oana
 
witnessed Sohriakoff leave, she stayed outside of her apartment
 
until 6:30 p.m. and did not see anyone else approach Selwyn's
 
apartment during that time. 
Archie Kaaua (Kaaua) was also a resident at Kamuela
 
Housing and could see Selwyn's apartment because it neighbored
 his. Kaaua testified that, on November 2, 2005, he saw
 
Sohriakoff outside of Selwyn's apartment but did not see him
 
enter at any time.
 
Finally, Alice Quanan (Quanan) was also a resident at
 
Kamuela Housing during the date of the alleged assault. Quanan
 testified that she could "very clearly" see Selwyn's apartment
 
from her own. Furthermore, Quanan saw Sohriakoff visit Selwyn's
 
apartment a total of three times on November 2, 2005, with the
 
first visit occurring sometime before 2:30 p.m. On no occasion
 
did Quanan see Sohriakoff enter Selwyn's apartment. Quanan also
 
testified that she "clearly" saw Sohriakoff leave Kamuela Housing
 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
between 4:30-5:00 p.m., and she claimed she never left her front
 
porch at any time between 4:30-8:00 p.m. 
As noted above, in December of 2005, Selwyn sought and
 
obtained a TRO against Sohriakoff. Soon after a hearing on the
 
TRO, held on March 1, 2006, Sohriakoff's attorney, Christopher
 
Roehrig (Roehrig), sent a letter on March 7, 2006, to the Chief
 
of Police, Lawrence Mahuna (Mahuna), requesting that the police
 
open an investigation of Selwyn for false reporting. Roehrig
 
also contacted deputy prosecuting attorney Rick Damerville
 
(Damerville) regarding Selwyn's prosecution for false reporting. 
After the police received Roehrig's letter, the focus of Officer
 
Tamura's investigation changed from a sexual assault claim to a
 
false reporting claim. Charges were brought against Selwyn and
 
the case eventually proceeded to trial in March of 2009.
 
After the close of evidence at trial, during the
 
State's closing argument, the prosecutor highlighted
 
discrepancies between Selwyn's testimony and the other evidence
 
presented at trial. In reference to Selwyn's email sent moments
 
after the alleged assault, the prosecuting attorney said: 
Now do you remember what her response was when she was
confronted with that email? First of all her response on
examination by her lawyer, her response was, "Well sometimes
I construct my emails early and then I send them out much
later." The problem with that is it makes no sense.
Because if you constructed early, then how can you say Mr.
Chad Sohriakoff continued to knock on my door several more
times until 5 p.m.? You couldn't construct it much earlier. 
Not – had to be after five. It's sent out 5:33. And between
 5:00 and 5:15 she says she's being sexually assaulted.
 
So putting the most that you can on it, you can say
well maybe she constructed it at 5:00, she got sexually
assaulted between 5 and 5:15, and then she decided to send
out her ordinary day's routine email since she forgot to
indicate that she's been sexually assaulted. Use your
 common sense. That's crazy. That is absolutely crazy.
 
In response to the prosecutor's closing argument,
 
defense counsel argued that the reason Selwyn took so long to
 
report the assault was because of her reaction to the deeply
 
personal and traumatic nature of the assault. Also, in an
 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
attempt to make Selwyn appear as the victim of a "witch hunt,"
 
the defense counsel also argued that Roehrig pressed the false
 
complaint charge without Sohriakoff's consent. 
Then, during the State's rebuttal argument, in
 
reference to defense counsel's argument suggesting Roehrig
 
initiated the false reporting claim against Selwyn without his
 
client's authorization, the prosecuting attorney said:
 
She makes some kind of deal about Chad Sohriakoff
 
didn't want to follow through on this false report. He
 
didn't tell Mr. Roehrig to do this. Well let me tell you
something, the victim of false reporting is the police.
It's the community. You pay every time the police go out
and spend time and hours investigating false reports. The
 victim, the residual victim, the person who is harmed by the
taint of the sex assault report that's Chad Sohriakoff. But
 the victim of this crime as instructed to you is the Police
Department. That's the victim.
 
Defense counsel did not object to the prosecuting
 
attorney's comments. 
The jury found Selwyn guilty of the offense of False
 
Reporting to Law Enforcement Authorities. Selwyn was sentenced
 
to a term of probation of one year. The special terms and
 
conditions of Selwyn's probation include 180 days in jail, 30 of
 
which she must serve with the remaining under advisement. 
Selwyn filed a timely appeal on July 7, 2009. Selwyn's sentence
 
was stayed pending appeal.
 
II.	 POINTS OF ERROR
 
Selwyn raises two points of error on appeal:
 (1) The prosecutor's conduct during the closing
 
arguments constituted misconduct and deprived Selwyn of her right
 to a fair trial. The first instance of alleged misconduct
 
occurred when the prosecutor propounded his personal opinion as
 
to the credibility of Selwyn's version of the events to the jury. 
The second instance of misconduct allegedly occurred when the
 
prosecutor appealed to the emotions of the jurors by telling them
 
that they, the police, and the community were the victims when
 
the police had to investigate the false report. 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(2) There was insufficient evidence to support
 
Selwyn's conviction. 
III. APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
Selwyn did not object to either of the alleged
 
instances of prosecutorial misconduct in the proceeding below.
 
If defense counsel does not object at trial to
prosecutorial misconduct, this court may nevertheless
recognize such misconduct if plainly erroneous. "We mayrecognize plain error when the error committed affectssubstantial rights of the defendant." State v. Cordeiro, 99Hawai'i 390, 405, 56 P.3d 692, 707 (2002) (citations and
internal quotation marks omitted). See also Hawai' i Rules 
of Penal Procedure (HRPP)
 Rule 52(b) (2003) ("Plain errors
or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticedalthough they were not brought to the attention of thecourt."). 
State v. Wakisaka, 102 Hawai' i 504, 513, 78 P.3d 317, 326 (2003). 
The appellate court "will apply the plain error
standard of review to correct errors which seriously affectthe fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicialproceedings, to serve the ends of justice, and to preventthe denial of fundamental rights." State v. Nichols, 111 
Hawai'i 327, 334, 141 P.3d 974, 981 (2006) (quoting State v.
Sawyer, 88 Hawai' i 325, 330, 966 P.2d 637, 642 (1998)). An 
appellate court's "power to deal with plain error is one tobe exercised sparingly and with caution because the plainerror rule represents a departure from a presupposition ofthe adversary system—that a party must look to his or hercounsel for protection and bear the cost of counsel'smistakes." Nichols, 111 Hawai' i at 335, 141 P.3d at 982
(quoting State v. Kelekolio, 74 Haw. 479, 515, 849 P.2d 58,74–75 (1993)). 
State v. Suan, 121 Hawai' i 169, 174, 214 P.3d 1159, 1164 (App. 
2009). 
Accordingly, "[w]e will not overturn a defendant's 
conviction on the basis of plainly erroneous prosecutorial 
misconduct, however, unless 'there is a reasonable possibility 
that the misconduct complained of might have contributed to the 
conviction'" State v. Wakisaka, 102 Hawai' i 504, 513, 78 P.3d 
317, 326 (2003) (citation omitted). In other words, "[p]rosecutorial misconduct warrants a new trial or the setting 
aside of a guilty verdict only where the actions of the 
prosecutor have caused prejudice to the defendant's right to a 
9  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
fair trial." State v. Clark, 83 Hawai' i 289, 304, 926 P.2d 194, 
209 (1996) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
"[W]henever a defendant alleges prosecutorial misconduct, this 
court must decide: (1) whether the conduct was improper; (2) if 
the conduct was improper, whether the misconduct was harmless 
beyond a reasonable doubt; and (3) if the misconduct was not 
harmless, whether the misconduct was so egregious as to bar 
reprosecution." State v. Maluia, 107 Hawai' i 20, 26, 108 P.3d 
974, 980 (2005). In assessing whether prosecutorial misconduct rises to the level of reversible error, the Hawai' i Supreme Court 
has set forth three factors to consider: (1) the nature of the alleged misconduct; (2) the promptness or lack of a curative 
instruction; and (3) the strength or weakness of the evidence 
against the defendant. Wakisaka, 102 Hawai' i at 515, 78 P.3d at 
328 (citation omitted). 
Regarding the sufficiency of the evidence:
 
We have long held that evidence adduced in the trial
court must be considered in the strongest light for the
prosecution when the appellate court passes on the legal
sufficiency of such evidence to support a conviction; the
same standard applies whether the case was before a judge or
a jury. The test on appeal is not whether guilt is
established beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether there was
substantial evidence to support the conclusion of the trier
of fact. Indeed, even if it could be said in a bench trial
that the conviction is against the weight of the evidence,
as long as there is substantial evidence to support the
requisite findings for conviction, the trial court will be
affirmed.
 
"Substantial evidence" as to every material element of
the offense charged is credible evidence which is of
sufficient quality and probative value to enable a [person]
of reasonable caution to support a conclusion. And as trier
of fact, the trial judge is free to make all reasonable and
rational inferences under the facts in evidence, including
circumstantial evidence.

IV. DISCUSSION
 
A. Prosecutorial Misconduct
 
Selwyn alleges that two instances of prosecutorial
 
misconduct during the closing arguments deprived her of her right
 to a fair trial. The first instance occurred when the
 
prosecuting attorney referred to Selwyn's version of events as
 
"crazy . . . absolutely crazy." Selwyn argues that, with this
 
remark, the prosecutor was advancing his personal opinion
 
regarding Selwyn's credibility.
 
"It is generally recognized under Hawai� i case law that 
prosecutors are bound to refrain from expressing their personal 
views as to a defendant's guilt or the credibility of witnesses." 
Clark, 83 Hawai� i at 304, 926 P.2d at 209 (citations omitted). 
The rationale for this prohibition is that a prosecutor's "improper suggestions, insinuations, and especially assertions of 
personal knowledge are apt to carry much weight against the 
accused when they should properly carry none." Id. (footnote and 
citations omitted). 
However, during closing argument, a prosecutor "is
 
permitted to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence and
 wide latitude is allowed in discussing the evidence." Id.
 
(citations omitted). "It is also within the bounds of legitimate
 argument for prosecutors to state, discuss, and comment on the
 
evidence as well as to draw all reasonable inferences from the
 
evidence. " Id. (citations omitted).
 
In Clark, conflicting evidence regarding the 
defendant's drug use was presented to the jury. During closing 
argument, the prosecutor stated "when the defendant comes in here 
and tells you that he was not on cocaine that night, that just – 
it's a cockamamie story and it's asking you to take yourselves as 
fools." Clark, 83 Hawai� i at 304, 926 P.2d at 209 (emphasis 
added; brackets omitted). The supreme court held that the remark 
was not improper based upon the evidence of the case and the 
11 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
context in which the phrase was utilized. Id. at 306, 926 P.2d
 
at 211. The court stated that "the prosecutor was within the
 
limits of propriety to infer, and indeed argue, that [the
 
defendant's] denial of drug usage was improbable, untruthful,
 
and, in short, a 'cockamamie story.'" Id. 
Here, the characterization of Selwyn's story as "crazy" 
is similar to the "cockamamie story" characterization in Clark. 
The remark was made in the context of the prosecutor's argument 
that Selwyn's testimony was not probable or believable. In this 
context, we conclude that this remark did not constitute 
misconduct. Cf. State v. Marsh, 68 Haw. 659, 660-61, 728 P.2d 
1301, 1301-02 (1986) (prosecutor's statements of her personal belief that defendant lied, on at least nine occasions, including 
that she was "sure [the defendant] committed the crime," and that 
the defendant's testimony was "an out-and-out lie," "taken as a 
whole" arose to the level of plain error); Suan, 121 Hawai' i at 
174, 214 P.3d at 1164 (prosecutor's statements that "these officers have integrity," "they could have come in here, no 
reports, told you anything, but they didn't," and "the purpose of 
the State today in this case is not to convict an innocent 
person" were improper). 
The second instance of alleged misconduct occurred when 
the prosecutor argued to the jury, in rebuttal, that the victim 
of false reporting is the police, the community, and that "[y]ou 
pay every time the police go out and spend time and hours 
investigating false reports." As Selwyn points out, under 
Hawai'i law, prosecutors should not use arguments which are 
calculated to inflame the passions or prejudices of the jurors and must refrain from "injecting issues broader than the guilt or 
innocence of the accused under the controlling law, or by making 
predictions of the consequences of the jury's verdict." State v. 
Sanchez, 82 Hawai' i 517, 532-33, 923 P.2d 934, 949-50 (App. 
1996)(emphasis omitted) (quoting 1 ABA Standards of Criminal 
12 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Justice (ABA Standards), The Prosecution Function, Standard 3­
5.8, Argument to the jury (2d ed. 1986)).3/ That principle has
 
been reiterated in a number of cases.
 
In State v. Apilando, 79 Hawai' i 128, 900 P.2d 135 
(1995), the prosecutor asked the jury during closing argument to 
"send a message to the defendant that his actions were wrong, 
they're not to be tolerated by this community. You have an 
authority to do that, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm asking you to 
find him guilty[.]" Apilando, 79 Hawai' i at 142, 900 P.2d at 
149. The Hawai' i Supreme Court held that such remarks were 
improper and reasoned as follows:
 
[W]e believe that such remarks could "divert the jury from
its duty to decide the case on the evidence, by injecting
issues broader than the guilt or innocence of the accused
under controlling law." . . . [W]e believe that there is
significant risk that the jury might find the defendant
guilty simply based on its view that the conduct the
defendant is accused of committing is intolerable, even
though it has not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt or
otherwise fails to support a conviction of the charged
offense.
 
Id. at 142-43, 900 P.2d at 149-50 (citations omitted). Although 
the supreme court determined that the prosecutor's remarks were 
improper, it did not reach the question of whether the improper 
remark rose to the level of reversible error because the court 
vacated the defendant's conviction based on other grounds. 
Apilando, 79 Hawai' i at 143, 900 P.2d at 150. 
In Sanchez, the prosecutor remarked in closing argument
 
that "[e]verybody in this County are [sic] victims" and that
 
3/
 ABA Standards, Standard 3-5.8, Argument to the jury:
 
. . . .
 (c) The prosecutor should not use arguments calculated to
inflame the passions or prejudices of the jury.
 (d) The prosecutor should refrain from argument which would
divert the jury from its duty to decide the case on the
evidence, by injecting issues broader than the guilt or
innocence of the accused under the controlling law, or by
making predictions of the consequences of the jury's
verdict.
 
13 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"[w]e're all the victims" of the firearm violation for which the 
defendant was charged. Sanchez, 82 Hawai' i at 532-33, 923 P.2d 
at 949-50. This court concluded that such remarks were improper. Id. Like in Apilando, however, the court in Sanchez did not 
reach the question of whether the aforementioned remarks, alone, would require reversal. Id. at 534, 923 P.2d at 951. 
More recently, in State v. Suan, 121 Hawai' i 169, 214 
P.3d 1159 (App. 2009), this court determined that the 
prosecutor's statement in closing argument that "resources, time, 
and dollars of the taxpayers are spent to seek justice in this 
case for the victim" was improper. Suan, 121 Hawai' i at 176, 214 
P.3d at 1166 (brackets omitted) (holding that the comment was "improper because it injected issues broader than Suan's guilt or 
innocence under the controlling law . . . and, in effect, 
diverted the jury from its duty to decide the case based on the 
evidence"). 
Here, the prosecutor's comments were much like those 
found to be improper in Apilando, Sanchez, and Suan. We 
similarly conclude that the prosecutor's remarks that "the victim 
of false reporting is the police[,]" "[i]t's the community[,]" 
and "[y]ou pay every time the police go out and spend time and 
hours investigating false reports" injected issues "broader than 
the guilt or innocence of the accused under the controlling law" 
into the case. See Sanchez, 82 Hawai' i at 533, 923 P.2d at 950. 
Also, the prosecutor should not have argued that "the victim of this crime as instructed to you is the Police Department." 
"However, our finding that the prosecutor's comments 
were improper does not end the inquiry. Since defense counsel 
did not object below to the prosecutor's remarks, we must 
determine whether the prosecutor's misconduct constituted plain 
error which affected substantial rights of the defendant." 
Marsh, 68 Haw. at 661, 728 P.2d at 1302 (citing Hawai' i Rules of 
Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 52(b)). Neither Apilando, Sanchez, 
14  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
or Suan reached the question of whether such comments, alone, 
required reversal of the defendant's conviction. See Apilando, 
79 Hawai' i at 143, 900 P.2d at 150; Sanchez, 82 Hawai' i at 534, 
923 P.2d at 951; Suan, 121 Hawai' i at 176, 214 P.3d at 1166. A 
conviction will not be overturned if the prosecutorial misconduct 
is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Wakisaka, 102 Hawai' i at 
515, 78 P.3d at 328. We must determine whether the improper comments substantially prejudiced Selwyn's right to a fair trial, 
by considering: (1) the nature of the alleged misconduct; (2) 
the promptness or lack of a curative instruction; and (3) the 
strength or weakness of the evidence against the defendant. Id.; 
State v. Agrabante, 73 Haw. 179, 198, 830 P.2d 492, 502 (1992). 
In this case, as we have discussed above, the 
prosecutor's remarks were improper. Although the prosecutor statements were made in rebuttal, purportedly in response to 
defense counsel's argument that Sohriakoff did not want to 
initiate a false reporting complaint, they strayed far afield 
from the issue of Selwyn's guilt or innocence under controlling 
law. Jurors could easily have personalized the comment that "you 
pay" when the police have to investigate false reports. (Emphasis 
added.) The purported victimization of the police and the 
community at large is clearly broader than the issue of Selwyn's 
guilt or innocence and creates a "significant risk that the jury 
might find the defendant guilty simply based on its view that the 
conduct the defendant is accused of committing is intolerable, 
even though it has not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt or 
otherwise fails to support a conviction of the charged offense." 
Apilando, 79 Hawai' i at 143, 900 P.2d at 150. As no objection 
was raised, no curative instruction was given. There were many pieces of evidence that undermined the believability of Selwyn's 
report of a sexual assault, including the neighbors' reports that 
they did not see Sohriakoff enter the apartment, Selwyn's email, 
the apparent delay in her reporting of the incident, and 
15 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Sohriakoff's testimony. However, the alleged assault purportedly
 
happened behind closed doors, with no one present but Selwyn and
 
Sohriakoff, and the assessment of their relative credibility was,
 
perhaps, the paramount issue. We cannot conclude that the
 
evidence against Selwyn was overwhelmingly strong or weak
 
although, as discussed below, we conclude that it was sufficient
 
to support Selwyn's conviction.
 
In reviewing these factors, we cannot conclude that the 
prosecutor's misconduct was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 
There is a reasonable possibility that the injection of the 
broader issues of who pays, and who is victimized, in cases of 
false reporting, may have contributed to the conviction. 
Accordingly, Selwyn's guilty verdict must be set aside. However, 
we do not conclude, in the broader context of the State's 
arguments and the albeit misguided attempts by the prosecutor to 
respond to an argument made by defense counsel, that the 
prosecution's misconduct was so egregious that a retrial should 
be barred. Cf. State v. Rogan, 91 Hawai' i 405, 984 P.2d 1231 
(1999) (appeal to racial prejudice was egregious misconduct). 
B. Sufficiency of the Evidence
 
The trial court instructed the jury regarding HRS
 
§ 710-1015 as follows:
 
There are two material elements of the offense of false
 
reporting to a [sic] law enforcement authorities, each of
which the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt.
These two material elements are, one, on or about December
19, 2005, in the South Kohala District, County and State of
Hawaii, the defendant, Sharon Louise Selwyn, intentionally
made a report to law enforcement authorities relating to the
crime of sexual assault; and, two, she knew that the
information contained in the report was false.
 
Selwyn does not dispute the evidence supporting the first
 
element, but alleges that because there was "substantial evidence
 
that the sexual assault had in fact occurred,", there was no
 
substantial evidence to prove the second element, i.e., that she
 
"knew that the information in the report was false." Selwyn
 
argues that the fact that "ample" evidence exists to support her
 
16 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
testimony proves that Sohriakoff sexually assaulted her. And,
 
because the sexual assault actually occurred, she lacked the
 
culpable state of mind necessary to prove the second element of
 
the offense of false reporting. 
Selwyn's argument is without merit. The record
 
contains ample evidence from which the jury could infer that
 
Selwyn was aware that the information contained in the report was
 
false. Selwyn's e-mail sent out at 5:33 p.m., moments after the
 
alleged assault occurred, failed to mention the assault even
 
though the purpose of the e-mail was to complain about
 
Sohriakoff. In his testimony, Sohriakoff expressly denied that
 
the sexual assault occurred. Several other tenants at Kamuela
 
Housing testified seeing Sohriakoff leaving the complex before
 
the time that Selwyn reported that the assault occurred. There
 
was testimony that Selwyn's report to police of the assault
 
occurred forty-seven days after the alleged incident; although it
 
appears that Selwyn called the rape crisis line five days after
 
the alleged incident. From the evidence adduced, it appears that
 
a reasonable person could conclude that Selwyn knew that her
 
report to the police was false. As such, we conclude that the
 
jury's verdict is supported by substantial evidence.
 
V. CONCLUSION
 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the Circuit
 
Court's June 23, 2009 Judgment of Conviction and Probation
 
Sentence and remand for a new trial.
