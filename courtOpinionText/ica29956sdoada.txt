STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
vs.
JULIA M. LOOK, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
HONOLULU DIVISION
(Case No. 1DTA-09-00166)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley, and Leonard, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Julia M. Look (Look) appeals from
the Judgment filed on June 29, 2009,1/ in the District Court of
the First Circuit (district court).2/
Look was convicted of operating a vehicle under the
influence of an intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii
Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 291E-61(a)(1) and (b)(1) (Supp. 2008). 
On appeal, Look argues that the district court erred by
denying her motion to dismiss the OVUII charge because the
written complaint and oral charge failed to state an essential
element of the offense, namely, that Look operated or assumed
actual physical control of a vehicle upon a public way, street,
road, or highway.3/NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties, we resolve Look's point of error as
follows:
"[T]he operation [or the assumption of actual physical
control] of a vehicle on a public way, street, road, or highway
is an attendant circumstance of the offense of OVUII, and is
therefore an element of the offense."  State v. Wheeler, 121
Hawai#i 383, 393, 219 P.3d 1170, 1180 (2009).  The OVUII charge
brought against Look was insufficient because it failed to allege
that Look operated or assumed actual physical control of a
vehicle upon a public way, street, road, or highway.  Id.   
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the district court's Judgment
filed on June 29, 2009, is vacated, and this case is remanded to
the district court with instructions to dismiss the OVUII charge
without prejudice.
