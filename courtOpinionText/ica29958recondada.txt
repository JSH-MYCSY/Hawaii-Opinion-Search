NO. 29958
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
ANTHONY KIM, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. 1DTC-06-010369)
ORDER DENYING THE MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
Upon consideration of Defendant-Appellant Anthony Kim’s
Request for Corrections and to Acknowledge Request to 
File In Forma Pauperis Upon Return to Hawaii in March, which this
court deems a motion for reconsideration of the January 28, 2010
order dismissing Appellant’s appeal, the papers in support, and
the records and files herein, it appears that: (1) on January 28,
2010, this court issued an order dismissing this appeal for non-
payment of the filing fee; (2) on March 3, 2010, Appellant filed
this request to set aside the dismissal; (3) pursuant to HRAP
Rule 40, a motion for reconsideration may be filed only within
ten days after the filing of the opinion, dispositional order, or
ruling; and (4) the request to set aside the January 28, 2010
order dismissing the appeal is untimely.  Therefore,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion for
reconsideration is denied.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, March 10, 2010.
