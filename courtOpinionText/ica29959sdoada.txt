OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
KENNETH K. MIYASAKI, RICHARD H. MIYASAKI,
JANET H. MIYASAKI, and LYNETTE MIYASAKI,
Plaintiffs-Appellees,
v.
 
FRANK'S AUTO PAINT, INC.,
Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(CIVIL NO. 1RC08-1-11490)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER

 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Frank's Auto Paint, Inc.
 
(Appellant) appeals from the June 25, 2009 (1) Judgment for
 
Possession/Ejectment (Judgment), (2) Writ of Possession/Ejectment
 (Writ), (3) Order Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary
 Judgment, Filed on April 7, 2009 (Order Granting Motion for
 Summary Judgment) and (4) Order Denying Defendant's Cross-Motion
 for Summary Judgment, Filed May 27, 2009 (Order Denying Cross-
Motion for Summary Judgment) issued by the District Court of the
 First Circuit, Honolulu Division.

On appeal, Appellant contends that the Judgment, the
 
Writ, the Order Granting Motion for Summary Judgment in favor of
 the Plaintiffs-Appellees Kenneth K. Miyasaki, Richard H.
 Miyasaki, Janet H. Miyasaki and Lynette Miyasaki (Appellees), and
 the Order Denying Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment in favor of
 the Appellant were erroneously issued since an enforceable rental
 contract had been negotiated and agreed to by the parties for the
 commercial real property located at 829, 903 and 905 Isenberg
 Street (the property) for the period of July 1, 2008 to June 30,
 2010. Appellees, on the other hand, contend that the
 negotiations had been unsuccessful, and that, specifically, no
 agreement was reached regarding the amount of rent due.

Appellant surrendered possession of the property on or
 
2
about August 1, 2009,  and Appellees sold the property to a third
party on April 23, 2010. 
The Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) previously

 
addressed the question of whether the appeal was moot at various
 
times throughout the appeal. On January 22, 2010, the court
 initially denied without prejudice a motion to dismiss the appeal
 as moot, explicitly reserving the question of whether Appellant's
 appeal might become moot when the lease expired on June 30, 2010. 
On August 5, 2010, the ICA denied another motion to dismiss,
 again without prejudice to any arguments to be presented on the
 briefs, because it appeared that "the issue of possible damages
 depends on the outcome of the appeal."
 
The appeal having been fully briefed, and the process
 
having run its course, we are afforded a complete factual picture
 against which to apply the law. Upon careful review of the
 record and the briefs submitted by the parties and having given
 due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised
 by the parties, we resolve Appellant's points of error as
 follows:
 
The Order Denying Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment is 
not a final appealable order. H
AW. REV. STAT. § 641-1(b) (1993); 
Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai 'i 115, 119, 
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
In addition, in light of the fact that Appellant has
 
vacated the property, that the property has been sold to a third­
3
party, and that the lease has expired,  the appeal from the Order
Granting Motion for Summary Judgment, the Judgment, and the Writ
 is moot. Int'l Market Place Corp. v. Liza, Inc., 1 Haw. App.
 
491, 495, 620 P.2d 765, 768 (1980).
 
2
 Appellees contend that Appellant abandoned the property on
August 1, 2009, while Appellant concedes that it vacated the property on
July 31, 2009.
 
3
 Appellant's contention that it may be entitled to damages if it
overpaid rent is not dependent on resolution of this appeal. Appellant filed,
but subsequently withdrew an application for leave to file a counterclaim in
the case. Consequently, Appellant's claim for damages is not at issue on
appeal, and there is no present basis upon which Appellant can collect
damages.

Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal from the June 25,
 
2009 Order Denying Defendant's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment,
 filed on May 27, 2009, is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction. The appeal from the June 25, 2009 Order Granting
 Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment, Filed on April 7, 2009,
 the June 25, 2009 Judgment for Possession/Ejectment, and the
 June 25, 2009 Writ of Possession/Ejectment is dismissed as moot.
