SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Defendants-Appellants Connie and Pete Muñoz (the
 
1
Muñozes) appeal solely  on behalf of Defendant-Appellant James
1
 The July 27, 2009 Notice of Appeal reads,
 
Defendant/Appellant James "Kimo" Akiu, through and by
his legal guardians, Connie and Pete Muñoz, and legal
guardians of James "Kimo" Akiu, Defendants/Appellants Connie
Muñoz and Pete Muñoz bring this Notice of Appeal based on
Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure, Rules 3, and 4, and
Hawai'i Revised Statues [sic], §602-5, §602.57 [sic], and
§641-1(a).
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Kimo Akiu (Akiu) from the July 6, 2009 Final Judgment (Final
 
Judgment) in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee Marian Dias (Dias)
 
entered by the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (circuit
 
court).2 Upon review of the record, it appears that we do not
 
have jurisdiction over the appeal brought by the Muñozes because
 the Muñozes' appeal as to themselves is untimely and the Muñozes
 
are not authorized to file a notice of appeal on Akiu's behalf.
 
Our review of the record reveals that Dias moved for 
summary judgment against all defendants and, on November 26, 
2007, the circuit court granted the motion as to all defendants 
except Akiu. On the same day, the circuit court entered a 
Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 54(b)-certified judgment in 
favor of Dias and against all defendants except Akiu which contains a determination of no just reason for delay. This 
November 26, 2007 judgment was an appealable judgment as to all 
defendants except Akiu. The July 27, 2009 Notice of Appeal filed 
by the Muñozes was untimely as to this judgment. Hawai' i Rules 
of Appellate Procedure Rule 4(a)(1). Thus, the November 26, 2007 judgment is final as to the Muñozes. 
Moreover, the July 27, 2009 Notice of Appeal purports 
to be on behalf of Akiu and is signed by the Muñozes, but not 
Akiu's attorney or guardian ad litem appointed in this case. The 
notice of appeal also contains a signature line for "James 'Kimo' 
Akiu, A mentally incapacitated adult" over which "James 'Kimo' 
Akiu P.M." is hand-printed but, based on our review of the 
record, does not appear to be the signature of Akiu. Under 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 605-2 (1993) and HRS § 605-14 
(Supp. 2011), persons not licensed to practice law in Hawai' i 
"are not permitted to act as 'attorneys' and represent other 
natural persons in [their] causes." Oahu Plumbing & Sheet Metal, 
Ltd. v. Kona Constr., Inc., 60 Haw. 372, 377, 590 P.2d 570, 573 
(1979). The Muñozes are apparently not licensed to practice law 
in Hawai' i as they moved the circuit court for counsel to be

appointed for Akiu. Conversely, Akiu's attorney and guardian ad
 
litem, both of whom were appointed by the circuit court and
 
approved the stipulated settlement upon which the Final Judgment
 
was based, have not filed a notice of appeal on Akiu's behalf. 
Accordingly, the July 27, 2009 notice of appeal is invalid and we
 
lack jurisdiction over this appeal.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that case number 29966 is
 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
