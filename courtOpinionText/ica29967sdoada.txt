OF THE STATE OF HAWAI rI 
STATE OF HAWAI rI, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
AIDA GORDON, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(Case No. 1DTC-08-044528)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER

 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Aida L.R. Gordon (Gordon) appeals

 
from the June 30, 2009 judgment entered in the District Court of
 
the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (district court).1
 
Gordon was convicted of Excessive Speeding, in
 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 291C-105(a)(1)
 
(2007).
 
On appeal, Gordon contends that (1) the district court
 
abused its discretion or committed plain error in admitting the
 
laser gun reading without adequate foundation of officer training
 
consistent with the manufacturer's requirements, (2) insufficient
 
evidence existed to sustain the conviction where mens rea and
 
valid evidence of speed were absent.
 
The State argues that the error as to the officer's
 
"training or qualification to use or test the laser gun" was not

preserved, because Gordon did not raise the issue at trial; that
 
plain error review should be declined; and that substantial
 
evidence, including mens rea, was established for the conviction.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Gordon's points of error as follows.2
 
(1) Gordon waived his challenge to Officer Russell 
Maeshiro's (Officer Maeshiro) testimony regarding the laser gun 
reading where Gordon failed to object to a lack of foundation at 
trial and no basis for plain error review exists. State v. 
Wallace, 80 Hawai ri 382, 409-10, 910 P.2d 695, 722-23 (1996); 
State v. Naeole, 62 Haw. 563, 570, 617 P.2d 820, 826 (1980). 
(2) There was sufficient evidence presented that
 
Gordon committed the offense of excessive speeding with the
 
requisite state of mind.
 
Officer Maeshiro testified that the readout on his LTI 
20/20 laser gun indicated that Gordon was traveling at seventy-
one miles per hour (mph). Evidence of the laser gun speed 
reading, "even though incompetent, if admitted without objection 
or motion to strike, is to be given the same probative force as 
that to which it would be entitled if it were competent." 
Wallace, 80 Hawai ri at 410, 910 P.2d at 723 (quoting 2 Wharton's 
Criminal Evidence ยง 265 n.3 (14th ed. 1986) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Additionally, Officer Maeshiro observed 
Gordon's vehicle passing two thirty-five mph speed signs. Gordon 
did not know her speed because she "was more concerned with [her] 
blind corners and trying to get into the right lane." The 
district court found "that the demeanor and testimony of Officer 
Russell Maeshiro [was] credible" and that Gordon "wasn't sure" of 
her speed, but that "Officer Maeshiro was sure" that the speed

 Both Gordon and the State cited to the Transcript of April 21, 2009

briefs.

reading was seventy-one mph. From these circumstances, the
 
district court could reasonably infer that Gordon recklessly
 
(consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk

that she)  traveled at seventy-one mph.  State v. Agard, 113 
Hawairi 321, 324, 151 P.3d 802, 805 (2007) ("[g]iven the 
difficulty of proving the requisite state of mind by direct evidence in criminal cases, proof by circumstantial evidence and 
reasonable inferences arising from circumstances surrounding the 
defendant's conduct is sufficient") (quoting State v. Eastman, 81 
Hawai
ri 131, 141, 913 P.2d 57, 67 (1996) (internal quotation 
marks omitted)). Consequently, in the light most favorable to the State, with the fact finder determining credibility, State v. 
Grace, 107 Hawai
ri 133, 139, 111 P.3d 28, 34 (App. 2005), 
sufficient evidence that Gordon committed the offense of excessive speeding with the requisite reckless state of mind was 
presented. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the June 30, 2009 judgment
 
entered by the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu
 
Division, is affirmed.

 See HRS ยง 702-204 (1993) stating, in pertinent part: "When the state
 
of mind required to establish an element of an offense is not specified by the
law, that element is established if, with respect thereto, a person acts
intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly." See also HRS ยง 702-206(3)(a)
 
(1993): "A person acts recklessly with respect to his conduct when he
consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the person's
conduct is of the specified nature."
