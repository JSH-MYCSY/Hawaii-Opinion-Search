IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
JORGE NORALES FERNANDEZ, Petitioner-Apellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P. NO. 09-1-0003)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Jorge Norales Fernandez
 
(Fernandez) appeals from the "Findings of Fact; Conclusions of
 
Law; Amended Order Denying Petition for Post-Conviction Relief"
 
(FOF/COL/Order) filed on June 25, 2009 in the Circuit Court of
 
the Fifth Circuit (circuit court).1
 
On June 1, 1992, Fernandez entered a no contest plea to
 
Sexual Assault in the Third Degree, in violation of Hawaii
 
Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 707-732(1)(b) (1993). The circuit court
 
sentenced Fernandez on December 17, 1992 to five years of
 
probation and filed the Judgment, Guilty Conviction and Probation
 
Sentence on December 18, 1992. Fernandez did not appeal his
 
conviction.
 
On August 22, 2007, Fernandez filed a "Rule 40 Petition
 
to Vacate Judgment of Conviction, and Demand for Hearing"
 
(Petition) pursuant to Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP)

Rule 40. In his Petition, Fernandez alleged that (1) his no
 
contest plea was "unlawfully induced or not made voluntarily or
 
with understanding of the nature of the charge and the
 
consequences of the plea" and (2) he received ineffective
 
assistance of trial counsel.
 
On June 25, 2009, the circuit court issued its
 
FOF/COL/Order, in which the circuit court found that Fernandez
 
had not shown that a manifest injustice would result if his
 
conviction for Sexual Assault in the Third Degree was not
 
vacated.
 
On appeal, Fernandez asserts the same claims as those
 
in his Petition. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude that
 
Fernandez's appeal is without merit.
 
Therefore, 
The "Findings of Fact; Conclusions of Law; Amended
 
Order Denying Petition for Post-Conviction Relief" filed on
 June 25, 2009 in the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit is
 
affirmed.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
