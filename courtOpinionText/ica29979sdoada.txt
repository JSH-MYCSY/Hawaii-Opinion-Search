 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Acasia raises five points on appeal. Acasia claims:
 
(1) the deputy prosecuting attorney trying his case committed
 
prosecutorial misconduct; (2) the circuit court erred when it
 
denied the defense's motion for judgment of acquittal; (3) the
 
circuit court's jury instruction on the use of deadly force for
 
the protection of a third person defense was prejudicially
 
erroneous; (4) Acasia's use of deadly force was justified under
 
the use of force for the protection of others defense; and
 
(5) the circuit court erred when it revoked Acasia's probation in
 
Cr. No. 06-1-0761 based solely on his conviction in Cr. No. 08-1­
0774.
 
After careful review of the issues raised, arguments
 
advanced, applicable law, and record in the instant case, we
 
resolve Acasia's points of errors as follows:
 
(1) The prosecutor did not engage in prosecutorial
 
misconduct because there is no reasonable possibility that the
 
prosecutor's line of questioning regarding Acasia's homelessness
 
contributed to the verdict. To determine whether the alleged
 
prosecutorial misconduct in this case constituted plain error
 
affecting Acacia's substantial rights, this court considered the
 
following factors: (1) "the nature of the alleged misconduct,"
 
(2) "the promptness or lack of a curative instruction," and (3) 
the strength or weakness of the evidence against [Acasia]." 
State v. Iuli, 101 Hawai' i 196, 208, 65 P.3d 143, 155 (2003) 
(quoting State v. Ganal, 81 Hawai' i 358, 374, 917 P.2d 370, 386 
(1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
Examining the nature of the alleged misconduct, which
 
was during the prosecution's cross-examination of Kelly Kaluna
 
(Kaluna) regarding her knowledge of Acasia's homelessness at the
 
time of the incident, it is apparent that the topic of Acasia's
 
homelessness was broached for impeachment purposes only. 
Kaluna's knowledge of Acasia's homelessness was just one in a
 
number of instances where the prosecution attempted to impeach
 
Kaluna's credibility by highlighting her inconsistent statements. 
Because the nature of the prosecution's questions was not
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
improper, any curative instruction given by the circuit court
 
would have been superfluous. Moreover, after analyzing the
 
entire record it is clear that the evidence against Acasia was
 
strong.
 
On appeal, Acasia also argues that his homelessness
 
creates unfair prejudice because it raises "inevitable
 
assumption" that he had a greater propensity to commit the crime. 
Acasia offers no evidence in support of his underlying
 
proposition that the jurors might believe a homeless person is
 
more likely to commit a violent crime than another person. Even
 
assuming arguendo that prejudicial impact existed, if it existed
 
at all, this impact was minimal at best, as the prejudicial
 
effect of this evidence is outweighed by its probative value. 
See Lewis v. United States, 930 A.2d 1003, 1008-09 (D.C. 2007);
 
see also People v. Thorton, 251 P.3d 1147, 1151 (Colo. App.
 
2010); Boyd v. State, 963 So. 2d 884, 885-87 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App.
 
2007). 
Because all three factors weigh in favor of the State,
 
there is no reasonable possibility that the prosecutor's line of
 
questioning regarding Acasia's homelessness contributed to the
 
verdict. As such, the prosecution's line of questioning did not
 
constitute prosecutorial misconduct.
 
(2) The circuit court properly denied Acasia's motion 
for judgment of acquittal. When viewed in the light most 
favorable to the State, there was substantial evidence of 
sufficient quality and probative value to support a prima facie 
case to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a 
conclusion of Acasia's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. 
Jenkins, 93 Hawai' i 87, 99, 997 P.2d 13, 25 (2000). At trial, 
the State adduced evidence, inter alia, that Ned Nakoa Jr.'s 
(Nakoa) death was caused by a subarachnoid hemorrhage due to the 
assaultive head trauma and that multiple witnesses observed 
Acasia strike Nakoa at least once in the face immediately before 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Nakoa died. Accordingly, the record is not devoid of substantial 
evidence supporting the conclusion that Acasia inflicted Nakoa's 
fatal injury. That there was conflicting testimony on how many 
of Acasia's punches or kicks Nakoa endured is of no benefit to 
Acasia because it is the province of the trier of fact, and not 
the appellate court, to determine the witnesses' credibility and 
to assess the weight and effect of the evidence adduced at trial. 
State v. Aplaca, 96 Hawai' i 17, 23, 25 P.3d 792, 798 (2001). 
Therefore, the circuit court did not err in denying Acasia's motion for judgment of acquittal. 
(3) and (4) The circuit court's erroneous jury 
instruction on the use of deadly force for the protection of a 
third person defense was harmless error. Because Acasia did not 
object to the jury instruction he challenges on appeal, this 
instruction was reviewed for plain error only. State v. Mark, 
123 Hawai' i 205, 219, 231 P.3d 478, 492 (2010). As the concept 
of retreat set forth in Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 703­
305(2) (1993) is entirely different from the concept of retreat 
as discussed in the circuit court's jury instruction, this 
instruction is erroneous as it misstates the law. Mark, 123 
Hawai'i at 224, 231 P.3d at 497. 
Because error must be viewed in light of the entire 
proceedings, the question becomes whether there was a reasonable possibility that error might have contributed to the conviction. 
Mark
, 123 Hawai' i at 229, 231 P.3d at 502. Because this defense 
applies only when the third person being defended could legitimately employ force, Kaluna herself must have legitimately 
been able to employ deadly force against Nakoa for her own 
protection. Assuming the truthfulness of Kaluna's testimony and 
taking her testimony in the light most favorable to the defense, 
a reasonable person would not believe that Kaluna would have been 
justified in using deadly force against Nakoa because Kaluna was 
able to retreat in complete safety. Kaluna was never physically 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
held or restrained by Nakoa, nor was she restrained or confined
 
by her physical location. Because Kaluna was easily able to
 
retreat she would not have been justified in using deadly force
 
against Nakoa. As a result, there was no rational basis on which
 
the jury could have concluded that Acasia was justified in using
 
deadly force for the protection of Kaluna. Consequently, there
 
was no reasonable possibility that the inclusion of the erroneous
 
jury instruction contributed to Acasia's conviction. Despite the
 
fact that the circuit court's jury instruction was erroneous and
 
misstated the law, this jury instruction resulted in harmless
 
error.
 
(5) The circuit court did not err when it revoked 
Acasia's probation in Cr. No. 06-1-0761 based solely on his 
conviction in Cr. No. 08-1-0774. "[A] trial court's decision 
revoking probation will not be disturbed on appeal absent an 
abuse of judicial discretion." State v. Lazar, 82 Hawai' i 441, 
443, 922 P.2d 1054, 1056 (App. 1996) (citing State v. Huggett, 55 Haw. 632, 635, 525 P.2d 1119, 1122 (1974)). "To constitute an 
abuse of discretion, it must appear that the court clearly 
exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles 
of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a litigant." 
Id. (citing State v. Sacoco, 45 Haw. 288, 292, 367 P.2d 11, 13 
(1961)). 
Based on his manslaughter conviction in Cr. No. 08-1­
0774, the circuit court revoked Acasia's probation stemming from
 
an earlier conviction for sexual assault in the second degree in
 
Cr. No. 06-1-0761. As stated herein, Acasia has failed to show
 
reversible error undermining his manslaughter conviction. As
 
such, the circuit court properly revoked Acasia's probation in
 
Cr. No. 06-1-0761 based on his conviction in Cr. No. 08-1-0774.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that (1) the July 13, 2009
 
Judgment of Conviction and Sentence; Notice of Entry and Mittimus
 in Cr. No. 08-1-0774, and (2) the July 13, 2009 Order of

Resentencing; Revocation of Probation in Cr. No. 06-1-0761 of the
