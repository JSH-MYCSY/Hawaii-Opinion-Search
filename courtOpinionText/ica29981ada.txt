I.
 
Evelyn Luka (decedent) was fifteen years old when she 
began dating Kevin Luka (Kevin), who was twenty-one at the time. 
Decedent married Kevin in 1997, soon after her graduation from 
high school in Hawai' i. Shortly after their marriage, the couple 
moved to Virginia, where Kevin was stationed in the U.S. Air Force. During their time in Virginia, Kevin was twice deployed 
overseas while decedent remained at home. During Kevin's second 
deployment, decedent began going out at night. Even after Kevin 
returned from deployment, he would often be unaware of her 
whereabouts. 
In July 1999, the couple returned to Hawai' i while 
Kevin was on leave. During this time, decedent stayed at her 
grandmother's house without Kevin and frequently went out at 
night, occasionally not returning until the next morning. Kevin 
acknowledged that decedent's grandmother was worried because 
decedent would not come home and that at one point she left the 
grandmother's and he did not know where decedent was living. 
After several weeks, Kevin's leave expired and he returned to 
Virginia, but decedent stayed in Hawai' i. 
The next month, when Kevin returned to Hawai' i, he and 
decedent lived with his parents. On Saturday, September 4, 1999, 
decedent took Kevin to Venus Nightclub (Venus), a popular 
nightclub on Kapi' olani Blvd. Kevin did not enjoy Venus because 
it catered to a homosexual clientele on Saturdays. After approximately fifteen minutes, Kevin left to wait outside for 
decedent, who agreed to come out at midnight. At around 
midnight, decedent met Kevin outside and wanted to stay longer, 
but agreed to go home after Kevin reminded her of their 
agreement. 
Later that morning, Kevin and decedent discussed their
 
relationship, and in particular their conflicting lifestyles. 
While decedent wanted to be out at night and visit nightclubs,
 
Kevin disapproved of her behavior, which he felt was not
 
2
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
conducive to his military lifestyle. Their discussion led to
 
talk of separation and the possibility of divorce, culminating in
 
an agreement that they should part ways and consider
 
reconciliation after a couple of years. They continued to
 
discuss their relationship that day.
 
On the evening of September 5, 1999, decedent wanted to
 
return to Venus but Kevin did not want to go. Kevin agreed to
 
drive decedent to Venus and she agreed to call him at midnight to
 
inform him if she needed a ride home. Before they left, they
 
engaged in sexual intercourse, with Kevin using a condom. Kevin
 
drove decedent to Venus at around 9:30 p.m. Decedent was wearing
 
loose black pants, which would slip down to reveal a small
 
portion of her underwear, and a maroon colored sleeveless shirt. 
Decedent was five feet, six inches tall and weighed approximately
 
130 pounds.
 
Several Venus employees saw decedent that evening and
 
described her as wearing dark or black pants and a purple or
 
maroon top. These employees recognized decedent as a regular
 
patron, particularly during the summer of 1999. Reid Takara
 
(Takara), a waiter at Venus who knew decedent, saw her the night
 
of September 5 and bought her food; decedent explained to Takara
 
that she had a curfew at midnight. When Takara saw decedent
 
around midnight, she appeared anxious to get home. Also around
 
midnight, decedent called Kevin, told him she was staying at
 
Venus an hour longer, and informed him that she would get a ride
 
home with a friend from the Salt Lake area. Several valets at
 
Venus saw decedent leave the club at around midnight with an
 
African-American male in a dark green Nissan Pathfinder.
 
Kevin believed decedent would be home by approximately
 
1:30 a.m. When decedent did not come home by 2:00 a.m. or 2:30
 
a.m., Kevin called Venus and asked to have decedent paged, but
 
the employee who answered the phone indicated the club was busy
 
and ignored his request. Kevin called the club again around 5:00
 
a.m. and the person who answered told Kevin that the club had
 
been closed for an hour. At around 9:00 a.m., decedent had still
 
3
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
not returned home and Kevin called her friends, parents,
 
grandmother, and aunt but was unable to ascertain decedent's
 
whereabouts.
 
On September 6, 1999, at approximately 8:00 a.m.,
 
Walter Hussey (Hussey), a distributor for the Honolulu
 
Advertiser, was on the Ka Uka Boulevard on-ramp to the H-2
 
freeway when he noticed what appeared to be a body moving in a
 
dirt area on the side of the on-ramp. Hussey continued driving
 
but believed the situation was odd and later returned to find an
 
unconscious woman lying face down and convulsing. He observed
 
that she was clothed, wearing pants and shoes, and that there
 
were tire tracks in the dirt above her body.
 
While Hussey was still at the scene, two off-duty
 
Honolulu Police Department (HPD) police officers, Officer Sharon
 
Walden (Ofr. Walden) and Sergeant Deborah Wilson (Sgt. Wilson),
 
were driving in the area and stopped when they saw decedent. The
 
officers observed that she was lying face down in the dirt,
 
making tremor-like movements, and had taxed breathing. Ofr.
 
Walden recalled that decedent was wearing unbuckled high-heeled
 
shoes, a purple shirt, and what appeared to be oversized black
 
work pants that were too big for her body. Ofr. Walden noted
 
that the pants were so oversized that they would have fallen off
 
decedent if she had been standing. Ofr. Walden suspected
 
decedent had been at the location for a long period of time
 
because of the amount of dirt that had been displaced by
 
decedent's movements and the indentation she had made on the
 
ground. Both officers unsuccessfully attempted to wake decedent
 
up by talking and yelling to her. Decedent was then taken by
 
ambulance to Queen's Medical Center, where she was determined to
 
be in a coma and placed on life support in the intensive care
 
unit.
 
As Ofr. Walden and Sgt. Wilson were leaving the scene
 
and merging onto the freeway, their attention was drawn to a
 
vehicle which had been parked underneath the Ka Uka Boulevard
 
4
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
overpass. An African-American male was standing outside the
 
vehicle and looking towards the area of where decedent's body was
 
laying. Both officers thought the situation was strange because
 
the black male would not have been able to see the area of the
 
woman from his location. The male entered his vehicle and drove
 
away as the officers entered onto the freeway. The officers
 
followed the male's vehicle and noted its license plate number.
 
Because doctors suspected sexual abuse, decedent was
 
examined by an expert in the treatment and examination of sexual
 
assault victims. The examination did not reveal any scarring,
 
bruising or discoloration to the genital area, or motile sperm on 
decedent's body. Decedent was removed from life support on
 
September 28, 1999, and died on October 2, 1999.
 
An autopsy performed by the Honolulu Medical Examiner's
 
office revealed the cause of death to be anoxic encephalopathy or
 
brain damage due to ligature strangulation (i.e., strangulation
 
with a long object across the neck). There were no injuries to
 
her anal or vaginal areas. There was, however, bruising of her
 
hands, knees, arms, legs, and buttocks.
 
HPD Detective Alexander Garcia (Det. Garcia) was
 
originally assigned to the investigation on September 6, 1999. 
After speaking to Sgt. Wilson and Ofr. Walden and reading their
 
reports, Det. Garcia tracked down the person whom the officers
 
observed standing next to the vehicle parked under the Ka Uka
 
Boulevard overpass. This person told Det. Garcia that he had
 
stopped to see if the body found was a missing child of a
 
relative or friend; Det. Garcia eliminated the person as a
 
suspect.2
 
Det. Garcia also interviewed Kevin, decedent's parents,
 
and several people at Venus, including the valets. Based on his
 
interviews with the valets, Det. Garcia generated a list of green
 
1997- and 1998-model Nissan Pathfinders. Det. Garcia was not
 
2
 Det. Garcia admitted at trial that his report failed to include
his interview of the person or his statement.
 
5
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
able to locate any Pathfinder matching the description. He did
 
not search for earlier models because one of the valets had
 
indicated that the vehicle was a late model Pathfinder. On
 
September 10, 1999, a Crime Stoppers bulletin was released
 
regarding the suspect in this case, then-classified as an
 
assault. The bulletin included a description of the suspect and
 
a composite drawing and described the possible vehicle as a new
 
model green Nissan Pathfinder.
 
In response to the Crime Stoppers bulletin, a person
 
named Michael Vargo (Vargo) contacted the police. Vargo provided
 
information about a person who fit the description in the
 
bulletin, which described the suspect as a black male, in his
 
early 30s, five feet ten inches tall, weighing 185 pounds, of
 
average build, and clean-cut. Vargo identified this person as
 
Deshon Dubois (Dubois). Vargo told police that Dubois drove a
 
dark green Nissan Pathfinder on Wheeler Air Force Base and
 
provided a corresponding license plate number.
 
Upon decedent's death in October 1999, the case was
 
reclassified as a homicide and Detective Allen Castro
 
(Det. Castro) took over the investigation. Det. Garcia informed
 
Det. Castro that Vargo's information did not lead to any suspects
 
in the case. Det. Castro did not know who Dubois was and thus
 
did not follow up on Vargo's information. Neither Dubois's nor
 
Vargo's name appeared in Det. Garcia's reports.
 
Det. Castro re-interviewed two valets at the club,
 
Justin Henson (Henson) and Jason Caldeira (Caldeira), whose
 
descriptions of the suspect the police had used in the Crime
 
Stoppers bulletin. Henson, the owner of the valet service at
 
Venus, saw decedent being dropped off between 9 and 9:30 p.m. 
Henson knew decedent as a regular patron during the summer of
 
1999 and had seen her on multiple occasions at the club. Henson
 
later saw decedent leave with the African-American male, whom he
 
described as in his thirties or older, of medium build, five feet
 
ten inches to six feet tall, and approximately 185 to 200 pounds. 
He remembered the male wearing dark dress slacks, a dressy tÂ­
6
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
shirt, and dress shoes. Henson saw the male arrive at Venus
 
around 8:00 p.m. or 8:30 p.m. that evening.
 
When decedent exited Venus with the male around 
midnight, decedent gave Henson the claim check for the male's 
vehicle, a dark colored Nissan Pathfinder with Hawai' i license 
plates. Henson had parked the vehicle earlier that night, specifically remembering that it had a tow hitch protruding eight 
to twelve inches from the rear of the vehicle. Henson believed 
Nissan Pathfinders did not normally come with tow hitches; this 
tow hitch was an "after-market" type, installed underneath the 
bumper. Henson was not certain about the color of the vehicle 
because the lighting in the parking lot was "not very good" and 
consisted of neon and florescent lighting. Henson had seen the 
African-American male once before at Venus and remembered seeing 
him earlier on the night in question because the male had entered 
the parking lot against the "Do Not Enter" sign. Henson did not 
see the male again after the night of September 5, 1999. 
Calderia worked for Henson's valet service and had seen
 
decedent five or six times prior to that evening. On the night
 
in question, Caldeira saw decedent leave Venus with an African-
American male, whom he described as six feet one inch to six feet
 
two inches tall, weighing between 175 to 180 pounds, in his late
 
twenties to mid-thirties, with very short, less than a quarter-
inch long, hair. He remembered the male wearing a V-neck shirt
 
and khaki pants. Caldeira saw decedent get into the passenger
 
side of the male's Nissan Pathfinder, which he described as a
 
very dark shade of green. He remembered hearing the tail end of
 
their conversation, during which decedent said, "You cannot fall
 
in love with someone the first time you meet them[,]" to which
 
the male responded, "Yes, you can." Caldeira remembered the male
 
and the vehicle because the male had come to Venus on prior
 
occasions and entered the parking lot from the wrong direction
 
each time.
 
Almost two years after the incident, Det. Castro had
 
not come across any new leads in the case and retired from the
 
7
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
police force on August 31, 2001. The case remained unsolved for 
another two years when Detective Sheryl Sunia (Det. Sunia), a 
homicide investigator, became involved with the case on June 1, 
2004. Upon reviewing the case files, Det. Sunia determined that 
no testing was performed on swabs taken during the initial sexual 
assault examination and requested that the police laboratory 
analyze the swabs. Testing revealed spermatozoa from an 
unidentified male. The DNA sample was downloaded into the 
Hawai'i State DNA database. 
In February 2007, Det. Sunia obtained information from
 
the DNA database indicating that the DNA of the unidentified male
 
matched that of Griffin. Griffin was subsequently asked to
 
provide a DNA blood sample for police. An HPD criminologist
 
tested evidence collected during the initial investigation for
 
DNA, testing decedent's clothing, body swabs, blood, and Kevin's
 
blood, against Griffin's blood. Kevin was excluded as a
 
contributor to a DNA obtained from decedent's clothing and body
 
swabs. The sperm fraction of decedent's vaginal swab had a DNA
 
profile that included Griffin's. The criminologist could not
 
determine specifically when the sperm DNA was deposited, such
 
that it could have been deposited on September 4, 5, or 6, 1999. 
Scrapings from decedent's fingernails contained too small of a
 
sample to be analyzed.
 
Det. Sunia's investigation included a search for the
 
Nissan Pathfinder in which decedent was seen leaving Venus. Det.
 
Sunia discovered that Griffin owned a 1996 Pathfinder in 1999,
 
which had later been auctioned to someone on Maui and had changed
 
owners "a couple" of times by 2007. In 2007, she went to Maui to
 
inspect the Pathfinder, which she discovered was black, had a
 
mounted spare tire on the rear, and did not have a tow hitch. 
Det. Sunia had the vehicle photographed and sprayed with Luminol,
 
a chemical used for detecting blood and other bodily fluids.
 
Griffin was arrested on March 29, 2007. At the main
 
police station, HPD Officer Ronald Lombardi (Ofr. Lombardi)
 
overheard Griffin talking to his wife on the telephone. Ofr.
 
8
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Lombardi heard Griffin tell his wife with a sense of urgency,
 
"clean the car, clean the car."
 
In 2009, shortly before trial, Det. Sunia also followed
 
up on Dubois, the suspect identified by Vargo in response to the
 
Crime Stoppers bulletin. Det. Sunia conducted a check of the
 
license plate number supplied by Vargo and ascertained that
 
Dubois was the registered owner of the Nissan Pathfinder Vargo
 
had described. Det. Sunia located Dubois on the mainland and
 
telephoned him; she learned that Dubois is African-American, and
 
in 1999 he was in his early 30s, had a short flat-top hairstyle,
 
owned a sequoia green Nissan Pathfinder, and lived in Schofield
 
Barracks. After interviewing Dubois, Det. Sunia determined that
 
he was not connected to decedent's death and that the only link
 
was that Dubois was African-American and previously owned a
 
Nissan Pathfinder. Investigators never showed Venus witnesses
 
Dubois's photograph. The Venus valets were shown a photographic
 
lineup including Griffin, but were unable to identify Griffin as
 
the suspect.
 
Griffin's wife, Nancy, spoke to police investigators. 
Nancy and Griffin were married on July 11, 1998, and in 1999 they
 
were living in Salt Lake. They had two children, including a son
 
born on October 24, 1999. Nancy was more than seven months
 
pregnant on September 6, 1999, and wore maternity pants sized 10
 
or 12.

A.
 
On April 4, 2007, Plaintiff-Appellee the State of 
Hawai'i (State) presented its case to the O' ahu Grand Jury. 
During Det. Sunia's testimony, a grand juror asked, "When was [Griffin] first questioned during custody in regards to this 
incident?" The deputy prosecutor interjected, stating, "I will 
need to call the Grand Jury Counsel (GJC) to answer that 
question." When the GJC arrived, grand jurors inquired as to the 
permissibility of asking "when [police investigators] first 
9
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
suspected or questioned [Griffin]" and "why they didn't test the
 
DNA in 1999." When one grand juror stated that the grand jury's
 
questions "had to do with when they first suspected or questioned
 
[Griffin, given that] the incident occurred in 1999[,]" the GJC
 
remarked, "I understand that. I think I read about that case in
 
the paper."
 
When a grand juror asked "why they didn't test the DNA
 
in 1999?" the GJC stated:
 
Maybe they didn't have access to the information, the DNA
until later.
 
I think there is a law that required sex offenders to
keep registering and things like that. 
Maybe, I don't know
if that is the facts in this case but at some point that
guy's DNA came up and they could match this DNA from the
dead woman to this list of people in their data information
in the computer.
 
When a grand juror then remarked, "I guess my question was more
 
like when did they first suspect this person?" The GJC again
 
mentioned reading about the case in the newspaper, responding,
 
I don't believe this fellow was a suspect until the DNA
match. . . . That's what I only know from the newspaper.
The reason why it's interesting is because of the DNA
situation that allows them to take these cold cases and
 bring them back to life.
 
As grand jurors conversed about information the police
 
had or did not have in 1999, the following exchange took place in
 
response to another grand juror's question:
 
GRAND JUROR: They had a picture from 1996 and a sketch
from 1999, so why were they calling him in 2007?
 
GRAND JUROR: Because -
[GJC]: Because they wanted to do a DNA on him. 
GRAND JUROR: But they could have done a DNA on him in
1999.
 
[GJC]: I don't think so.
 . . . .
 He wasn't registered as such to give aÂ­. . . . 
He may not have been in the computer.
 
10
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
During the same discussion among the grand jurors
 
regarding the investigators' information in 1999, the GJC
 
interjected: "They probably - it doesn't sound from what you
 
told me that they had enough to accuse him of anything at that
 
time."
 
Later a grand juror asked, "So why did they take this
 
guy and bring him in?" In response, the GJC expounded:
 
They must have had some other evidence that I'm not aware
of. I don't know what they've told you but they must have
had some evidence back in 1999 when this girl was found when
they did the investigation then. [There may] have been
somebody that drew a diagram or somebody they thought might
be in the neighborhood at the time when she died. Maybe
they didn't have somebody to fit that diagram yet, I don't
know.
 
When a grand juror remarked, "I was thinking about
 
where they got that picture of him?" and another stated, "And
 
then no DNA evidence until 2007 and that is what I-", the GJC
 
interrupted stating, "He may not have registered as a -" after
 
which a grand juror interrupted counsel stating, "I don't know
 
that he's ever registered as anything at all. That hasn't been
 
brought into the case?"
 
During a discussion of what type of questions they
 
could ask, one grand juror asked, "They can (indiscernible) and
 
do that but I mean, I've just got to ask questions like, you
 
know, they just say they had ligature marks on her neck, what
 
caused it?" The GJC responded, "Someone strangling her, I
 
guess."
 
As the grand jurors discussed whether Griffin was a
 
suspect in 1999, the GJC again made reference to reading about
 
the case in the newspaper and added: 
[GJC]: See, the only - the only information that I
have about this case is what I read in the newspaper.
 
GRAND JURY: I don't even have that.
 
[GJC]: You may never have seen it.
 GRAND JURY: I did. 
11
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
[GJC]: The interesting part of the case to lawyers and
to law enforcement, obviously, is the use of DNA in this
case that brings about the ability to close cases that have
been considered â
 
Ultimately, the grand jury reconvened and resumed
 
questioning Det. Sunia. A grand juror asked, "What made him a
 
suspect?" and Det. Sunia answered:
 
We have a general data base and the evidence recovered from
[decedent] showed an unidentified male donor. That evidence
 was downloaded into this data base. The week before I was
 notified towards the end of the week this data base that is
 constantly checking, comparing and doing all these checks of
DNA, it showed a potential suspect. . . . It was Darnell
 Griffin.
 
The State's presentation ended shortly thereafter. The O' ahu 
Grand Jury handed down an indictment against Griffin, charging
 
him with (1) Murder in the Second Degree, in violation of Hawaii
 
Revised Statutes (HRS) Â§ 707-701.5 (1993); and (2) Sexual Assault
 
in the First Degree, in violation of HRS Â§ 707-730(1)(a) (1993).
 
B.
 
On March 6, 2009, Griffin filed a Motion to Dismiss the
 
Indictment with Prejudice, alleging GJC misconduct. At its
 
initial March 19, 2009 hearing on Griffin's motion, the circuit
 
court noted that the only existing standards for indictment
 
dismissals that were relevant to Griffin's motion were those
 
involving prosecutorial misconduct. Additional briefing by the
 
parties revealed a dearth of case law on the matter. During its
 
final April 8, 2009 hearing on the motion, the trial court,
 
without objection from either party, applied a standard utilized
 
for motions to dismiss indictments based on prosecutorial
 
misconduct. The court stated:
 
And the Defense has asserted that the Court is to apply a
standard or test which is stated in State v. Joao, [53 Haw.
226, 491 P.2d 1089 (1971)], which has been applied to the
misconduct of the prosecutor; however, for the purposes of
this motion and in ruling, I will apply this standard in the
absence of any others, and the Court is going to find that
based on the record before the Court, that the movant has
not shown that the words and conduct of the independent
counsel tended to induce action other than that which the
 jurors in their uninfluenced judgment deemed warranted on
evidence fairly presented before them; and therefore the
motion is denied.
 
12
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
C.
 
On March 6, 2009, Griffin also filed a "Motion for
 
Order Allowing Introduction of [Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE)]
 
412 Evidence at Trial." Griffin argued that evidence of victim's
 
marital affairs and promiscuity was relevant to demonstrate that
 
(1) Griffin did not cause victim's death, pursuant to HRE Rule
 
412(b)(2)(A); (2) victim consented to sexual contact with
 
Griffin; and (3) to impeach the credibility of Kevin. The
 
prosecution had sought to exclude this evidence via its Motion in
 
Limine No. 4. At the hearing regarding introduction of HRE Rule
 
412 evidence, the court granted the State's motion in limine,
 
implicitly denying Griffin's HRE Rule 412 Motion.
 
D.
 
On April 27, 2009, after a jury trial, Griffin was
 
convicted of the murder charge but found not guilty of the sexual
 
assault charge. On May 7, 2009, Griffin filed a Motion for
 
Judgment of Acquittal, which was denied on June 10, 2009. The
 
circuit court filed its order denying the motion, along with its
 
findings of fact and conclusions of law on July 21, 2009. On
 
July 1, 2009, the circuit court entered a judgment of conviction
 
and sentenced Griffin to life imprisonment without the
 
possibility of parole.
 
III.
 
Grand Jury Counsel
 
On appeal, Griffin first challenges the circuit court's
 
denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment in this case.3 As
 
3
 As an initial matter, the State contends Griffin's argument is
barred because it was made moot by the jury's verdict of guilt on the murder
charge. Hawai' i courts have held that "the mootness doctrine is properly
invoked where events have so affected the relations between the parties thatthe two conditions for justiciability relevant on appeal -- adverse interestand effective remedy -- have been compromised." In re Doe, 102 Hawai' i 75,
77, 73 P.3d 29, 31 (2003) (internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted). 
However, the authority to which the State cites, Doe, State v.
Montgomery, 103 Hawai' i 373, 381, 82 P.3d 818, 826 (App. 2003), and
Commonwealth v. McCullough, 501 Pa. 423, 461 A.2d 1229 (1983), is inapposite.All involved a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the

he frames the issue,
 
[t]he indictment in the instant case was the result of
"circumstances" which prevented the grand jury fromexercising fairness and impartiality during the grand juryproceedings. The instant case presented an extraordinarysituation in which the grand jury counsel introducedinformation and evidence, which not only had not beenintroduced by the State but also was irrelevant, extremelyprejudicial, and not for the grand jury's consideration.. . . Because the grand jury counsel's comments wereimproper and beyond what are proscribed by his duty, theerror deprived [Griffin] of his constitutional right to afair and impartial grand jury proceeding under the fifth andfourteenth amendments to the U.S. Constitution and article I, Â§Â§ 5 and 10 of the Hawai' i Constitution. 
"A circuit court's ruling on a motion to dismiss an indictment is 
reviewed for an abuse of discretion." State v. Akau, 118 Hawai' i 
44, 51, 185 P.3d 229, 236 (2008) (internal quotation marks, citation, and brackets omitted). 
The standard employed by the circuit court in denying 
Griffin's motion to dismiss the indictment presents a preliminary 
issue for review. As observed by the circuit court in applying 
the standard in evaluating allegations of prosecutorial 
misconduct articulated in State v. Joao, 53 Haw. 226, 491 P.2d 
1089 (1971) to Griffin's challenge, it did so in light of the 
absence of any other guidance on the issue. We begin by 
examining the applicability of this standard, a question of law 
we review de novo. See generally, Maile Sky Court Co., Ltd. v. 
City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 85 Hawai' i 36, 39, 936 P.2d 672, 675 
(1997). 
The independent grand jury counsel, established by 
article I, section 11 of the Hawai' i Constitution and implemented

While the trial phase "remains the actual adjudicatory 
stage of the guilt or innocence of the accused[,]" "the grand 
jury phase is devoted only to a preliminary determination of 
whether criminal proceedings should be instituted against any 
person." State v. Bell, 60 Haw. 241, 246, 589 P.2d 517, 520 
(1978) overruled on other grounds by State v. Chong, 86 Hawai' i 
282, 949 P.2d 122 (1997). This preliminary determination focuses 
on "whether there is probable cause to believe that a crime has 
been committed" by the accused, id. at 243, 589 P.2d at 519 
(citing United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 343 (1974)), and 
the Hawai' i Constitution requires that the grand jury find 
probable cause as to every element and the culpable state of mind of any offense for which the defendant may later be convicted.

See Haw. Const. art. I, Â§ 10; State v. Stan's Contr., Inc., 111 Hawai'i 17, 31-32, 137 P.3d 331, 345-46 (2006). The grand jury 
makes this probable cause determination based on evidence only the prosecutor presents. See Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure 
(HRPP) Rule 6. 
The grand jury proceeding is not adversarial, insomuch
 
as its purpose is not the adjudication of the accused's guilt or
 innocence. See Bell, 60 Haw. at 243-44, 589 P.2d at 519. 
Indeed, an accused and his counsel are not entitled to be present
 at all. State v. Rodrigues, 63 Haw. 412, 417, 629 P.2d 1111,

The unique independent grand jury counsel serves to
 
advise the grand jury solely regarding matters of law and only
 
when called upon to do so.6 The grand jury counsel's role "is
 
not to serve as an advocate on the accused's behalf." State v.
 
Hehr, 63 Haw. 640, 641, 633 P.2d 545, 546 (1981). Rather, the
 
grand jury counsel "was established to ensure an independent
 
grand jury and to relieve the prosecutor of the conflicting
 
burdens of presenting evidence in support of the indictment and
 
advising the grand jury on matters of law[,]" id. at 641, 633

With this historical and functional context in mind, we
 
turn to consideration of the proper standard for evaluating the
 
conduct of the grand jury counsel. As the circuit court applied
 
a standard developed to evaluate prosecutorial misconduct before
 
the grand jury, we next review the development of this standard,

court's absence. The grand jury counsel may be present
during grand jury proceedings, and if not present in the

as the role of the prosecutor and the limits of that role serve
 
as a preexisting counterpoint to the role of grand jury counsel.
 
In Joao, the Hawai' i Supreme Court affirmed the 
dismissal of an indictment for first degree murder based on 
prosecutorial misconduct during grand jury proceedings. 53 Haw. 
at 230, 491 P.2d at 1092. There, the deputy prosecutor 
presenting the case to the grand jury made a comment vouching for 
the state's witness's credibility, commenting that the witness 
"was the original defendant charged with the murder" and "has 
decided to make a clean breast" and failed to correct the witness 
when he understated his criminal record. Id. at 227, 491 P.2d at 
1090. In addition, the prosecutor made other unrecorded7 
statements to the grand jury regarding the state's witness. Id. 
The trial court found that "the Grand Jury might not have returned an indictment if these statements" had not been made and 
found that the defendants "were prejudiced in their 
constitutional rights to a fair and impartial hearing." Id. at 
227-28, 491 P.2d at 1090. Given these findings by the circuit court, the Joao court concluded that the prosecutors' conduct 
violated the defendants' due process rights. 
A tendency to prejudice may be presumed when, in
presenting cases to the grand jury, the trial court finds
that the prosecutor or his deputies have engaged in words or
conduct that will invade the province of the grand jury or
tend to induce action other than that which the jurors in
their uninfluenced judgment deem warranted on the evidence
fairly presented before them.
 
Id. at 229, 491 P.2d at 1091 (quoting Commonwealth v. Favulli,
 
224 N.E.2d 422, 430 (Mass. 1971)).
 
Unwilling to engage in speculation regarding what
 
decision the grand jurors would have reached without this
 
conduct, the Joao court decreed,
 
7
 At the time of the grand jury proceedings in Joao, evidence, but 
not the remarks of prosecutors, were recorded. See McMahon v. Office of the 
City & Cnty. of Honolulu Pros. Attorney, 51 Haw. 589, 593, 465 P.2d 549, 552
(1970). In light of the incomplete record in Joao, the Hawai' i Supreme Court
amended court rules to require recordation of all statements before the grandjury. See, 53 Haw. at 230 n.4, 491 P.2d at 1092 n.4; HRPP Rule 6(d).

It is unnecessary that appellees prove that the grand jury
was in fact influenced by the statements. Such a burden
 might well be impossible to meet. We cannot second guess
the grand jury by assuming that it would have returned an
indictment against the appellees even if the character of
the proceeding had been other than what it was.
 
Id. at 229, 491 P.2d at 1091 (citations omitted).8
 
In State v. Pulawa, 62 Haw. 209, 614 P.2d 373 (1980),
 
the supreme court again reviewed an allegation of prosecutorial
 
misconduct at the grand jury stage.9 Relying on federal and outÂ­
of-state authority, the Pulawa court built on the Joao standard
 and adopted the following rule: 
Unless the prosecutor's misconduct before a grand jury
is extreme and clearly infringes upon the jury's decision-
making function[,] it should not be utilized as a stepping
stone to dismissal of an indictment. As has often been
 observed, an indictment should only be quashed on the
clearest and plainest grounds.
 
Id. at 218, 614 P.2d at 378 (quoting State v. Schamberg, 370 A.2d
 
482, 485 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1976)); see also United
 
States v. Chanen, 549 F.2d 1306, 1310-11 (9th Cir. 1977). In
 
applying this new standard, the Pulawa court, who had
 
characterized the conduct in Joao as being "on the extreme side,"
 
8 In the decade following Joao, a number of cases involving 
challenged indictments were decided, applying varying standards. See State v. 
Apao, 59 Haw. 625, 586 P.2d 250 (1978) superceded by statute on other grounds
as noted in Briones v. State, 74 Haw. 442, 456 n.7, 848 P.2d 966, 974 n.7(1993); State v. Murphy, 59 Haw. 1, 575 P.2d 448 (1978); State v. Scotland, 58Haw. 474, 572 P.2d 497 (1977); State v. Layton, 53 Haw. 513, 497 P.2d 559(1972). As the supreme court later observed in State v. Chong, 86 Hawai' i 
282, 286-88, 949 P.2d 122, 126-28 (1997), all of these cases involveddismissals based on improper evidence, as opposed to prosecutorialimproprieties. 
9 Like Joao, Pulawa involved a prosecutor's unsolicited comments to
 
the grand jury regarding the credibility of a testifying witness. While
 examining Xavier Adriano (Adriano), whose grand jury testimony conflicted with
his earlier statements to police, the prosecutor repeatedly cautioned Adriano
that he was under oath. Id. at 211-13, 614 P.2d at 375-76. Towards the
 
conclusion of Adriano's testimony, the prosecutor confronted him, saying, "I
have already advised [you] that you are under oath and subject to penalty of
perjury if you falsify any statement, any material statement to the Grand
Jury." Id. at 212, 614 P.2d at 375 Later, just before the grand jury foreman
finished questioning a detective in the case, the prosecutor interjected the
following: "As far as any possible perjury charges against [Adriano] and any
line, we'll bring that up in a further hearing if we feel we've got sufficient
evidence." Id. at 212-13, 614 P.2d at 376. This conduct drew Pulawa's
 
motion to dismiss the resulting indictment against him and an appeal from the
denial of his motion.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
observed that the trial court in Pulawa had found neither
 
prosecutorial misconduct nor undue influence, and consequently
 
affirmed the trial court's denial of the motion to dismiss. 62
 
Haw. at 216-18, 614 P.2d at 377-78. 
Seventeen years later, the Hawai' i Supreme Court again 
addressed the standard for dismissal of an indictment based on 
alleged prosecutorial misconduct, and reaffirmed the continued 
vitality of Joao. State v. Chong, 86 Hawai' i 282, 949 P.2d 122 
(1997). In evaluating the prosecution's use of written questions and anticipated answers to prepare witnesses for their grand jury 
testimony, the Chong court examined its post-Joao decisions in 
Scotland, Apao, and Pulawa, and characterized these cases as 
"refinements of--and elaborations on--the Joao analysis." Id. at 
286-88, 949 P.2d at 126-28. The Chong court focused on Bell
10 
particularly Justice Kidwell's concurring opinion, and explained 
that Justice Kidwell "accurately distilled Joao's relative place 
within 'the criteria which should govern' the grant or denial of 
a motion to dismiss an indictment." Id. at 288, 949 P.2d at 128. 
[A] grand jury proceeding is not adversary in nature. An
 
application of this principle is found in the rule that an
indictment may not be attacked on the ground of the
incompetency of the evidence considered by the grand jury,
where prosecutorial misconduct is not involved. State v.
 
Layton, 53 Haw. 613, 497 P.2d 559 (1972); United States v.
Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 94 S.Ct. 613, 38 L.Ed. 2d 561
(1974). The function of a grand jury to protect against
unwarranted prosecution does not entail a duty to weigh the
prosecution's case against that of the defense, or even to
 
10 The court in Bell held that "the prosecution is not required to
 
present exculpatory evidence to the grand jury unless that evidence is
[c]learly exculpatory." Id. at 253, 589 P.2d at 524.
 
The Bell court went on to address the circuit court's finding
"that had the prosecution informed the grand jury of the [exculpatory
evidence], the grand jury 'might well have declined to indict' defendant[.]"
Id. at 255, 589 P.2d at 525. The Bell court was "not convinced of the
 propriety of the circuit court's finding[,]" stating "we do not agree that
State v. Joao, supra, requires dismissal of the indictment." Id.
 
In Chong, the supreme court commented on the Bell court's
characterization of Joao and distinguished the two cases, stating,"[o]bviously implicit in [Bell's description of Joao] was the premise that thefinding of fact upon which the Joao court had relied was not clearlyerroneous." Chong, 86 Hawai' i at 287, 949 P.2d at 127 (emphasis added). "By
contrast . . . the Bell court deemed the circuit court's relevant finding offact [in Bell] to be clearly erroneous as a matter of law." Id.

determine that the prosecution's case is supported by
competent evidence.
 
On the other hand, an indictment that is the result of
 
prosecutorial misconduct or other circumstances which
 
prevent the exercise of fairness and impartiality by the
 grand jury may be successfully attacked." State v. Joao, 53
 
Haw. 226, 491 P.2d 1089 (1971);
[3] State v. Pacific Concrete
 
and Rock Co., Ltd., 57 Haw. 574, 560 P.2d 1309 (1977).
3
 Consistently with Justice Kidwell's analysis, the Joao
 
court emphasized that, in reaching its result, it was
"neither passing upon the credibility of grand jury
witnesses nor upon the competency or adequacy of the
evidence adduced." Joao, 53 Haw. at 229 n.2, 491 P.2d at
 
1091 n.2. Rather, it was "the prejudicial character of the
prosecutor's conduct" that was "the sole object of the
court's inquiry." Id.
 
Chong, 86 Hawai' i at 288-89, 949 P.2d at 128-29 (quoting Bell, 60 
Haw. at 256-57, 589 P.2d at 526 (Kidwell, J., concurring)).
 
The court went on to reaffirm the Joao analysis and
 
expressly adopt Justice Kidwell's concurrence. Chong, 86 Hawai' i 
at 290, 949 P.2d at 130. In applying this standard, the Chong
 
court employed language from both Pulawa and Joao, forming a
 
hybrid of the two differing standards:
 
Given the record in this case . . . we hold that the
 
prosecution's use of pre-scripted questions and
answers . . . did not so clearly infringe upon the jury's
decision-making function and was not so innately prejudicial
that the practice -- in and of itself -- violated Chong's
right to due process of law by invading the province of the
grand jury or tending to induce action other than that which
the grand jurors, in their uninfluenced judgment, deemed
warranted on the evidence fairly presented before them.
 
Chong, 86 Hawai' i at 289, 949 P.2d at 129. Compare Pulawa, 62 
Haw. at 218, 614 P.2d at 378 ("Unless the prosecutor's misconduct 
before a grand jury is extreme and clearly infringes upon the 
jury's decision-making function it should not be utilized as a 
stepping stone to dismissal of an indictment. As has often been 
observed, an indictment should only be quashed on the clearest 
and plainest grounds.") with Joao, 53 Haw. at 229, 491 P.2d at 
1091 (citation omitted) ("A tendency to prejudice may be presumed 
when, in presenting cases to the grand jury, the trial court 
finds that the prosecutor or his deputies have engaged in words 
or conduct that will invade the province of the grand jury or 
20
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
tend to induce action other than that which the jurors in their
 
uninfluenced judgment deem warranted on the evidence fairly
 
presented before them.").
 
As Justice Kidwell articulated in his concurrence in
 
Bell, "an indictment that is the result of prosecutorial
 
misconduct or other circumstances which prevent the exercise of
 
fairness and impartiality may be successfully attacked." 60 Haw.
 
at 257, 589 P.2d at 526 (Kidwell, J., concurring). Alleged grand
 
jury counsel misconduct falls within these "other circumstances"
 
preventing the "fairness and impartiality" of the grand jury
 
proceedings. Therefore, upon sufficient findings, a court may
 
properly grant a motion to dismiss brought based on alleged grand
 
jury counsel misconduct.
 
For motions to dismiss based on prosecutorial
 
misconduct, the cases make clear that the burden lies with the
 
defendant. See Pulawa, 62 Haw. at 214, 614 P.2d at 376; Apao,
 
59 Haw. at 637, 586 P.2d at 259 (quoting Scotland, 58 Haw. at
 476-77, 572 P.2d at 499) ("We hold that in proceedings
 
determining the validity of an indictment, the state does not
 
have the burden of proving that the alleged illegal or improper
 
testimony is not prejudicial; it is the duty of the defendant to
 
come forward and present a case proving prejudice."); 
State v.
 
Melear, 63 Haw. 488, 492, 630 P.2d 619, 623 (1981) ("Appellant
 
has the burden of proving prejudicial prosecutorial misconduct
 
before the grand jury."); 
Layton, 53 Haw. at 516, 497 P.2d at 561
 
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted) ("The
 presumption, until the contrary appears, is that a grand jury
 
acted upon legal evidence, and the burden rests on him who
 
asserts that it did not to prove it."). We see no compelling
 
reason to change who shoulders the burden for motions to dismiss
 
based on grand jury counsel misconduct.
 
The applicable standard in the grand jury counsel
 
misconduct context should be tailored to the authorized role and
 
function of the grand jury counsel, that is, to advise the grand
 
jury on the law to be applied in making its probable cause
 
21
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
determination. Thus, to warrant dismissal of an indictment, a
 
defendant must show that the grand jury counsel's misconduct has
 
clearly infringed upon the grand jury's decision-making function
 
and invaded the province of the grand jury, and that the
 
misconduct tended to induce action other than that which
 
reasonable grand jurors, in their uninfluenced judgment, would
 
deem warranted based on the evidence fairly presented to them.
 
As applied to the facts in this case, the circuit court
 
did not abuse its discretion in finding that the GJC's statements
 
did not warrant dismissal of the indictment. The circuit court
 
found that, though the GJC mentioned Griffin's case was in the
 
newspaper, this fact was already known to at least one juror. 
Additionally, the circuit court noted that, though the GJC
 
"stated that there is a law that requires sex offenders to
 
register in response to a question from a grand juror who
 
wondered why there was no DNA test [performed] in 1999 . . .
 
counsel immediately stated that he did not know if that was the
 
fact in [this] case." When a grand juror asked why Griffin was
 
asked to provide a DNA sample in 2007, and not earlier, the GJC
 
"responded that he didn't know if the State had enough evidence
 
to accuse Defendant or if Defendant was a suspect at the time." 
The circuit court thus found that "[t]hese statements and
 
responses from independent counsel, while improper, did not
 
prejudice the grand jury proceedings" because they "did not
 
invade the province of the grand jury."
 
Griffin has not specifically challenged the circuit 
court's findings of fact. "Generally, findings not challenged on 
appeal are also binding on this court." State v. Rapozo, 
123 Hawai' i 329, 351, 235 P.3d 325, 347 (2010). 
Based on the facts as found, the circuit court
 
correctly concluded that the GJC's statements did not give rise
 to a tendency to prejudice. While better left unsaid, the
 
statements were either regarding matters already known to the
 
grand jurors or were clarified so that it was made clear the GJC
 
was not stating a fact in Griffin's case, so they did not
 
22
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
"clearly infringe[] upon the [grand] jury's decision-making
 
function," Pulawa, 62 Haw. at 218, 614 P.2d at 378, or "invade
 
the province of the grand jury or tend to induce action other
 
than that which the jurors in their uninfluenced judgment deem
 
warranted on the evidence fairly presented before them." Joao,
 
53 Haw. at 229, 491 P.2d at 1091. Indeed, statements by the
 grand jurors indicated that some of the GJC's statements were
 
non-responsive to their questions.
 
In sum, there is no indication here that the circuit 
court exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded the law. See 
State v. Wong, 97 Hawai' i 512, 517, 40 P.3d 914, 919 (2002). 
Therefore, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in 
denying Griffin's motion to dismiss the indictment. 
HRE Rule 412 Evidence
 
As his second point of appeal, Griffin contends that
 
the circuit court erred in precluding evidence of decedent's
 
prior sexual behavior. The evidence Griffin sought to introduce
 
stemmed from Kevin's statements to police that decedent had
 
extramarital affairs and oftentimes stayed out late at clubs. 
Griffin's argument contesting the exclusion of this past sexual
 
behavior evidence is two-pronged.
 
First, Griffin claims that evidence of a victim's prior
 
sexual behavior is constitutionally required under HRE Rule
 
412(b)(1),
11 because it is "relevant, material, and favorable to
 
11 At the time of trial, as it does now, HRE Rule 412 (Supp. 2010)
provides, in pertinent part:
 
Rule 412 Sexual offense and sexual harassment cases;
relevance of victim's past behavior.  (a) Notwithstanding
any other provision of law, in a criminal case in which a
person is accused of a sexual offense, reputation or opinion
evidence of the past sexual behavior of an alleged victim of
the sexual offense is not admissible to prove the character
of the victim to show action in conformity therewith.
 
(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in a
criminal case in which a person is accused of a sexual
offense, evidence of an alleged victim's past sexual
behavior other than reputation or opinion evidence is not
(continued...)
 
23
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
[his] defense" insomuch as it "would have established the
 
possibility that persons other than [Griffin] could have
 
committed the . . . offenses." He also argues that evidence of
 
decedent's prior sexual behavior was admissible under HRE Rule
 
412(b)(2)(A) because it would have shown that he was not the
 
cause of decedent's injuries.
 
Preliminarily, we note that the use to which Griffin
 
expected to put this prior sexual behavior evidence is clearly to
 
prove propensity. In his view, evidence that decedent had
 
previously stayed out late at clubs and engaged in affairs,
 
proved that she stayed out late and engaged in an affair on the
 
date in question, albeit with someone other than himself. The
 
question becomes whether Griffin had another, permissible purpose
 
for the admission of this evidence.
 
Griffin argued below that he wanted to present this
 
evidence "to raise the defense where other people could have
 
committed [the instant offenses]." Griffin's argument misses the
 
mark as he does not adequately explain how evidence of decedent's
 
prior sexual behavior would have shown that other persons were
 
responsible for decedent's injuries. In other words, Griffin has
 
not shown that the proffered sexual behavior evidence was
 
11(...continued)
admissible to prove the character of the victim to show
action in conformity therewith, unless the evidence is:
 
(1)	 Admitted in accordance with subsection (c)(1)
and (2) and is constitutionally required to be
admitted; or
 
(2)	 Admitted in accordance with subsection (c) and
is evidence of:
 
(A)	 Past sexual behavior with persons other
than the accused, offered by the accused
upon the issue of whether the accused was
or was not, with respect to the alleged
victim, the source of semen or injury; or
 
(B)	 Past sexual behavior with the accused and
 is offered by the accused upon the issue
of whether the alleged victim consented to
the sexual behavior with respect to which
sexual assault is alleged.
 
24
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
relevant. Griffin has not identified other persons who could
 
have caused decedent's death nor has he shown how her previous
 
behavior points to someone else as her killer.
 
In State v. Rabellizsa, 79 Hawai' i 347, 350, 903 P.2d 
43, 46 (1995), the Hawai' i Supreme Court addressed evidence of 
third-party motive to commit the crime for which the defendant was charged. The court held that "there must be a nexus between 
the proffered evidence and the charged crime" and that third-
party motive "must be coupled with substantial evidence tending 
to directly connect that person with the actual commission of the 
offense." Id. (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). 
In this case, Griffin has presented no evidence linking any third person to decedent's death, let alone substantial evidence. Id. 
at 351, 903 P.2d at 47. He has also failed to show how evidence of decedent's prior sexual behavior could sufficiently link 
identifiable third persons to her death. In short, Griffin has 
not demonstrated that decedent's prior sexual behavior was 
relevant by establishing that it had a "tendency to make the 
existence of any fact that is of consequence" to his defense that 
someone else killed the decedent "more probable or less 
probable[.]" HRE Rule 401. 
In his second argument, Griffin maintains that in a
 
case like his which combines charges of murder and sexual
 
assault, the language of HRE Rule 412 "provides no bar to the
 
admission of [decedent's] prior sexual behavior in defense to a
 
non-sexual offense such as murder in the second degree." The
 
plain language of HRE Rule 412 does not support Griffin's
 
argument. Nothing in HRE Rule 412 indicates that it is
 
inapplicable to cases including a non-sexual assault charge
 
combined with a sexual assault offense. Rather, HRE Rule 412
 
applies "in a criminal case in which a person is accused of a
 
sexual offense[.]" HRE Rule 412(a) and (b) (emphasis added). 
Moreover, even assuming, arguendo, that such a
 
limitation to HRE Rule 412 was contemplated by the legislature 
and that Griffin's proffered evidence had some possible relevance
 
25
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
to his theory of defense, the circuit court's decision to exclude
 
Griffin's proffered evidence was harmless here. There was no
 
shortage of evidence that decedent was a participant in a
 
clubbing lifestyle and whose whereabouts were largely unknown by
 
her family. On this record, the marginal relevance of the
 
somewhat dated, proffered evidence was cumulative of the other
 
evidence presented to the jury and was therefore excludable. HRE
 
Rule 403.12
 
The circuit court was correct in excluding evidence of
 
decedent's prior sexual behavior.
 
Evidence of Griffin's Police Station Phone Call
 
Griffin's third point of appeal concerns the admission 
of evidence at trial regarding his in-custody telephone 
conversation with his wife, Nancy, in 2007. The evidence at 
issue was elicited during the testimony of Ofr. Lombardi, who 
stated that he overheard Griffin, while in custody, speak to 
Nancy over the telephone. Ofr. Lombardi testified that Griffin 
said, "Clean the car, clean the car" with a sense of urgency. 
Griffin did not object to Ofr. Lombardi's testimony at trial, 
which ordinarily waives any claim that the evidence was 
improperly admitted. See State v. Vliet, 91 Hawai' i 288, 298-99, 
983 P.2d 189, 199-200 (1999). Nevertheless, he asks this court to review this admission of evidence for plain error. See HRPP 
Rule 52(b). Specifically, Griffin argues that this evidence was irrelevant under HRE Rule 401 and, to the extent it was relevant, 
was inadmissible under HRE Rule 403. 
Relevance is a low threshold. Relevant evidence need
 
not prove a case on its own; it "need only be a building block of
 
12
 HRE Rule 403 provides:
 
Exclusion of relevant evidence on grounds of prejudice,
confusion, or waste of time.  Although relevant, evidence
may be excluded if its probative value is substantially
outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of
the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of
undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of
cumulative evidence.
 
26
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
a prima facie case." See State v. Silva, 67 Haw. 581, 586, 698 
P.2d 293, 297 (1985). Indeed, it is evidence having any tendency 
to make a material fact more or less likely. HRE Rule 401. Nor 
must the evidence establish the fact by itself; it is enough to 
establish a link in a longer, evidentiary chain. See Walsh v. 
Chan, 80 Hawai' i 212, 216, 908 P.2d 1198, 1202 (1995) (evidence 
that driver was injured in auto accident relevant to whether the 
accident had the capacity to injure and therefore had some 
relevance to whether passenger-plaintiff could have been injured 
by the accident; court cites to previous "chain of inference" 
cases); Kaeo v. Davis, 68 Haw. 447, 450-53, 719 P.2d 387, 389-91 
(1986) (evidence driver consumed alcohol and was "feeling good" 
supported the ultimate inference that he operated his vehicle 
negligently); State v. Prince, 67 Haw. 231, 235, 683 P.2d 1217, 
1219 (1984) (defendant ripping picture off the hotel wall was 
"probative of a disregard for money" and "wild[] spending spree" 
showed defendant's money was not hard-earned, which supported the 
inference it came from the charged robbery). Relevancy 
determinations are reviewed de novo. Walsh, 80 Hawai' i at 215, 
908 P.2d at 1201. 
Ofr. Lombardi's statements had at least some bearing on
 
Griffin's consciousness of guilt and his attempts to conceal
 
evidence linking him to decedent's death, both facts at issue in
 
the case. Griffin disputed the State's theory that Nancy's
 
actions helped to prevent police from linking him to decedent's
 
death. Ofr. Lombardi's testimony is properly viewed as a
 
building block in supporting that theory.
 
Griffin also argues that, even if relevant, Ofr.
 
Lombardi's testimony should have been excluded "if its probative
 
value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair
 
prejudice, confusion of the issues or misleading the jury or by
 
considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless
 
presentation of cumulative evidence" under HRE Rule 403. 
However, the only argument Griffin makes in support of this claim
 
27
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
is, because he no longer owned the Nissan Pathfinder implicated
 
in the crime when he made the statement in issue, the jury might
 
have been confused into believing his statement to "clean the
 
car" was an attempt to destroy evidence in this case.
 
Counsel for both sides noted in front of the jury that
 
Ofr. Lombardi's testimony concerned events in 2007. The
 
prosecution mentioned the date twice during its examination of
 
Ofr. Lombardi. More importantly, during cross-examination,
 
Griffin's counsel's last question to Ofr. Lombardi was, "And this
 
was in 2007, sir?" Considering Ofr. Lombardi's testimony as a
 
whole, there is no plain error to be found in the admission of
 
statements regarding Griffin's telephone conversation while in
 
custody.
 
Sufficiency of the Evidence
 
Griffin's fourth and final point on appeal alleges 
there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for 
Murder in the Second Degree.13 When a conviction is challenged 
based on the sufficiency of the evidence, the "test on appeal is not whether guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt, but 
whether there was substantial evidence to support the conclusion 
of the trier of fact." State v. Richie, 88 Hawai' i 19, 33, 960 
P.2d 1227, 1241 (1998) (citation omitted). "'Substantial' evidence . . . is credible evidence which is of sufficient 
quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable 
caution to support a conclusion." Id. "[E]vidence adduced in 
the trial court must be considered in the strongest light for the prosecution when the appellate court passes on the legal 
sufficiency of such evidence to support a conviction." State v. 
13
 HRS Â§ 707-701.5 defines the offense of Murder in the Second
Degree:
 
(1) Except as provided in section 707-701, a person commits
the offense of murder in the second degree if the person
intentionally or knowingly causes the death of another
 person.

'i 131, 135, 913 P.2d 57, 61 (1996) (citation 
omitted). 
Griffin points to several specific aspects of the 
State's case and argues how the evidence presented could support 
contrary inferences and conclusions. However, it is not for the 
appellate court to second-guess the jury. State v. Gabrillo, 10 
Haw. App. 448, 457, 877 P.2d 891, 895 (1994) ("[T]his court will not attempt to reconcile conflicting evidence, or interfere with 
a jury decision based on the credibility of witnesses or the 
weight of the evidence. The jury's finding of the requisite 
elements of the crime charged is clearly reflected in its 
verdict.") (internal quotation marks, citations, brackets, and 
ellipsis omitted). "Verdicts based on conflicting evidence will 
not be set aside where there is substantial evidence to support 
the trier of fact's findings." State v. Sua, 92 Hawai' i 61, 69, 
987 P.2d 959, 967 (1999) (quoting Aga v. Hundahl, 78 Hawai' i 230, 
237, 891 P.2d 1022, 1029 (1995)) (brackets omitted). 
Griffin claims the State offered no evidence 
identifying him as the person who left Venus with decedent. 
While it is true that no one definitively identified Griffin as 
the person who left Venus with decedent, multiple witnesses 
testified that decedent left the club with a person generally 
matching his description and in a vehicle that was of the same 
make and model as Griffin's. Although there was some conflicting 
testimony about the color of the suspect vehicle, all who 
described it agreed that it was of dark color. As to the 
conflict between the valet's testimony that the suspect vehicle 
had an after-market tow hitch and the absence of a tow hitch on 
the Pathfinder Griffin had previously owned when Det. Sunia 
examined it years later, the jury could have discounted the 
valet's testimony or found that Griffin's vehicle had been 
altered, given the long passage of time and the multiple times 
the vehicle had changed hands after Griffin owned it. Kevin 
testified that decedent told him she was catching a ride with 
someone from Salt Lake; Griffin lived in Salt Lake at the time. 
29
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In addition, the DNA evidence showed that Griffin had sex with
 
the decedent within a short time frame that surrounded her death. 
Therefore, there was substantial evidence from which the jury
 
could infer that decedent left Venus with Griffin.
 
Griffin claims the State offered no evidence that he
 
caused decedent's injuries, noting that police were unable to
 
find any evidence on decedent's body or clothing linking Griffin
 
to her. While acknowledging that the State's DNA evidence
 
connected him to decedent, Griffin alleges the State could not
 
prove that he engaged in sexual intercourse with her during the
 
period beginning late on September 5, 1999, when decedent was
 
seen leaving Venus, to early morning September 6, 1999, when her
 
body was found near the on-ramp to the H-2 freeway.
 
Nevertheless, the State's DNA evidence placed Griffin
 
with decedent on or around the September 6, 1999 date when she
 
was last seen uninjured. Physical evidence showed that the pants
 
decedent was wearing on the morning of September 6, 1999, did not
 
fit her, but were the same size as maternity pants that Griffin's
 
wife wore during the months surrounding decedent's death. 
Decedent's body was found without panties, although decedent wore
 
panties when she went to Venus that night as her pants were
 
described as revealing her underwear. The off-duty officers who
 
saw decedent at the Ka Uka on-ramp noted that the sandals
 
decedent had on were unbuckled. This evidence supports the
 
inference that decedent had been dressed, but carelessly, without
 
her underwear and with pants that were not hers, before she was
 
left along the roadway. The jury could have reasonably inferred
 
that the person who removed the underwear and changed decedent's
 
pants had engaged in sex with her. The jury could also have
 
reasonably inferred that the person who removed decedent's
 
underwear and changed her pants did so to destroy possible DNA
 
evidence contained within these items so it would not be
 
discovered when decedent was found. The DNA swabs taken from
 
decedent matched decedent and Griffin. It was reasonable to
 
infer that Griffin was the person who removed decedent's clothing
 
30
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to hide compelling evidence that he was with decedent on the
 
night in question and that Griffin was the person that strangled
 
decedent, as someone who had not had sex with decedent would have
 
no reason to remove such evidence.
 
More than this, Nancy's testimony provided additional
 
corroboration of Griffin's guilt. Nancy testified that Griffin
 
owned a black Nissan Pathfinder and worked full time for Anteon
 
Corporation at Wheeler Air Force Base where one witness, Vargo,
 
claimed to have seen the Nissan Pathfinder described in the Crime
 
Stoppers bulletin. Nancy testified that Griffin would go out at
 
night without her, she would not know his intended destination,
 
and in September 1999, Griffin's habit was "not [to] come
 
straight home." She gave conflicting statements and testimony
 
regarding where Griffin was on Sunday, September 5, 1999, through
 
Monday, September 6, 1999. Thus, the jury could have rejected
 
Nancy's inconsistent testimony and rejected her alibi testimony
 
that Griffin was home with her during the relevant time frame.
 
Nancy also gave inconsistent accounts regarding how
 
Griffin wore his hair. For example, she told Det. Sunia in a
 
recorded statement that Griffin always kept his hair short but
 
testified that he wore his hair bald in 1999. Again, the jury
 
could have rejected Nancy's testimony that Griffin's appearance
 
differed from that described by Venus employees at the time of
 
the offense.
 
Nancy's testimony also established Griffin's
 
consciousness of guilt soon after the events of September 5,
 
1999. She testified that in 1999, she and Griffin were at home
 
engaged in conversation when a Crime Stoppers bulletin regarding
 
decedent's case appeared on television. When the bulletin
 
mentioned that the description of the suspect's vehicle was a
 
"green" Nissan Pathfinder, Griffin appeared relieved.
 
Nancy also testified that later, when Griffin was asked
 
to provide a DNA sample to police, he responded, "They can't do
 
this. I'm gonna to call somebody. They can't do this." She
 
described his demeanor as "very defensive." Griffin asked,
 
31
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
during a telephone conversation regarding giving a sample, why he
 
had to give one, why he had to give one "now" and what would
 
happen if he refused to give a sample.
 
Finally, the jury heard and reasonably rejected the
 
evidence the defense relied on to show errors in the police
 
investigation, or that uncharged persons, including Kevin, could
 
have committed the crimes in question. Although the police
 
investigation was not exemplary, there was no evidence indicating
 
Kevin was involved in decedent's death. Although police failed
 
to adequately document their interaction with Vargo, who
 
implicated Dubois in response to the Crime Stoppers bulletin in
 
1999, in their interactions with Vargo and Dubois, investigators
 
felt confident that Dubois was not involved and the jury
 
reasonably relied on their expertise.14
 
When taken as a whole, legitimate and reasonable 
inferences drawn from the evidence supported the jury's unanimous 
verdict. See Eastman, 81 Hawai' i at 135, 913 P.2d at 61.

 We also note that Vargo's statements to police implicating Dubois
