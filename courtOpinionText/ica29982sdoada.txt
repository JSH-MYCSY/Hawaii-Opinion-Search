STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
GARY S. BONDS, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
HONOLULU DIVISION
(Case No. 1DTC-08-046214)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Gary S. Bonds (Bonds) appeals from
the Judgment filed on July 6, 2009 in the District Court of the
First Circuit, Honolulu Division1 (district court).
The district court convicted Bonds of Excessive
Speeding, in violation of HRS § 291C-105(a)(1) (2007 Repl. &
Supp. 2009).
On appeal, Bonds contends the District Court (1) abused
its discretion by denying his motion to compel discovery and
(2) erred in admitting the laser gun reading without adequate
foundation2 where the State of Hawai #i (State) failed to
establish that (a) the laser gun used by Officer Rosalez had been
tested according to the manufacturer's accepted procedures, and
(b) Officer Rosalez was qualified by training and experience to
operate the laser gun.
The State concedes that it failed to lay sufficient
foundation for admission of the laser gun speed reading.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, asNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Bond's
points of error as follows:
The record is sufficient to review Bonds's point of
error that the State failed to adduce sufficient evidence that
the laser gun had been tested according to the manufacturer's
recommended procedures to establish sufficient foundation for the
laser gun reading.
Officer Rosalez did not testify that the laser gun was
tested in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications. 
Therefore, the State failed to adduce sufficient evidence
regarding the accuracy of the laser gun, and the laser gun
reading should not have been admitted into evidence.  State v.
Assaye, 121 Hawai# i 204, 210-14, 216 P.3d 1227, 1233-37 (2009).  
Without evidence of the laser gun reading, there is insufficient
evidence to convict Bonds of Excessive Speeding.  We need not
address Bonds' other point of error.  
Therefore,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment filed on July 6,
2009 in the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu
Division, is reversed. 
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, May 18, 2010.
