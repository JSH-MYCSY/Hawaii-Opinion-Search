NO. 29983
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
IN THE INTEREST OF RJ, JJ, MJ, DJ, RJ2, and LH,
Minors
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(FC-S NO. 07-00668)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Appellant Mother (Mother) appeals from the Decision and
 
Order Terminating the Parental Rights of [Mother] and Awarding
 
Permanent Custody filed on June 10, 2009 in the Family Court of
 
the Fifth Circuit (family court).1
 
On appeal, Mother contends the State of Hawai 'i 
Department of Human Services (DHS) failed to prove that she could 
not provide a safe family home. Mother argues that none of the 
service providers stated that she lacked insight to provide a 
safe home and a lone social worker from DHS determined that 
Mother lacked insight. Mother further argues that if she failed 
to achieve insight, then DHS failed to provide her with an 
adequate service plan designed to give her insight. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Mother's
 
points of error as follows:
 
DHS proved by clear and convincing evidence that Mother
 
was not presently willing and able to provide a safe family home

and would not be willing and able to provide a safe family home
 
in the reasonably foreseeable future even with the assistance of
 
a service plan.
 
Although Mother argues that DHS's contention that she
 
lacked "insight" is a red herring and a lone DHS social worker
 
should not make such a determination, there is ample evidence
 
that Mother cannot provide a safe family home for her children. 
Initially, Mother denied any physical abuse of her children had
 
occurred. However, evidence in the record indicates that several
 
of the children reported being physically abused by her and her
 
male associate. One child had scars on his arm and back from
 
being whipped with an object. Yet, Mother continued to deny that
 
any abuse occurred, continued her relationship with her male
 
associate despite her children's fear the male associate would
 
harm or kill them, and stated that her children were lying about
 
the abuse. Mother's continued denial that abuse occurred
 
demonstrates she cannot grasp the basic reason why DHS is still
 
involved with her and her children after two years.
 
Mother demonstrated she could not presently provide a
 
safe family home because she did not address her children's fear
 
of her male associate. Mother's refusal to address claims of
 
abuse and statements that her children were lying also
 
demonstrate that she would be unwilling to protect them in the
 
future because she would not believe any claims of abuse or
 
address claims of abuse.
 
Mother's claim that DHS failed to provide an adequate
 
service plan is without merit. There is no service plan DHS can
 
provide that can force Mother to acknowledge that her children
 
were abused if she simply chooses to ignore the voluminous and
 
credible evidence presented to her.
 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Decision and Order
 
Terminating the Parental Rights of [Mother] and Awarding
