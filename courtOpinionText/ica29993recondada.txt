NO. 29993
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
MICHAEL C. TIERNEY, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

 
(CRIMINAL NO. 08-1-0869)
 
ORDER DENYING MOTIONS FOR RECONSIDERATION

 
AND TO REVIEW PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Appellant's January 11, 2011
 
Motion for Reconsideration En Banc, and Motion of Certified
 
Question of Conflict, the papers in support, and the record and
 file herein, it appears that Appellant is seeking reconsideration
 of this court's December 29, 2010 Summary Disposition Order.
 
Appellant fails to show that the court overlooked or
 
misapprehended any point of law or fact. In addition, on
 December 1, 2009, this court entered an order with respect to
 motions filed by Appellant advising Appellant that "all requests
 for relief should be by counsel[,]" and denying Appellant's
 request for relief on that basis. On July 28, 2010, this court
 denied motions filed by Appellant on that same basis. 
It further appears that Appellant moves for a review of 
a March 19, 2009 denial of his Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus; however, this court does not have jurisdiction over such matters. Haw. Rev. Stat. § 660–3 (1993); Hawai
'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure Rule 21(d). Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motions are denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, January 27, 2011.
