APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CRIMINAL NO. 08-1-0869)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Michael C. Tierney (Tierney)
 
appeals from the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence (Judgment)
 
filed on October 27, 2009 in the Circuit Court of the First
 Circuit (Circuit Court).
1 Tierney was convicted by a jury on
 
charges of burglary in the second degree in violation of section
 
2
708-811, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)  and theft in the second
degree in violation of HRS § 708-831(1)(b).3 Tierney was
 
sentenced to incarceration for a term of five years, with credit

 
1/ The Honorable Richard K. Perkins presided. 
2/ (1) A person commits the offense of burglary in the second degree
if the person intentionally enters or remains unlawfully in a building with
intent to commit therein a crime against a person or against property rights. 
(2) Burglary in the second degree is a class C felony. 
HAW. REV. STAT. § 708-811 (1993). 
3/ (1) A person commits the offense of theft in the second degree if
the person commits theft:
 
. . . .

for time served. 
On appeal, Tierney contends that the Circuit Court
 
erred (1) in denying his motion to disqualify the judge, (2) in
 
denying his motion to dismiss for outrageous government conduct,
 (3) in denying his right to counsel, (4) by not impaneling a
 second jury pool after an incident of juror misconduct, (5)
 because insufficient evidence was presented to convict Tierney of
 theft in the second degree and burglary in the second degree, (6)
 in denying his motion to subpoena Dr. Nathan Angle, thereby
 denying him his right to compulsory process, and (7) because the
 cumulative effect of all the aforementioned errors denied him his
 right to due process and his right to a fair trial. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Tierney's
 points of error as follows:
 
(1) It was not erroneous for the Circuit Court to deny
 
Tierney's motion to disqualify Judge Perkins or for Judge Perkins
 to fail to recuse himself. Tierney's complaint against Judge
 Perkins with the Honolulu Police Department (HPD) is not included
 in the record on appeal, and Tierney filed no affidavit or
 declaration "stat[ing] the facts and reasons for the belief that
 bias or prejudice exists." H
AW. REV. STAT. § 601-7(b) (1993).  
Even if we accept Tierney's contention that he has 
filed a complaint with the HPD as true, the record discloses no basis that might "fairly give rise to an appearance of impropriety and reasonably cast suspicion on the judge's impartiality." Jou v. Schmidt, 117 Hawai
'i 477, 484, 184 P.3d 
792, 799 (App. 2008) (quoting State v. Brown, 70 Haw. 459, 467 n.3, 776 P.2d 1182, 1188 n.3 (1989)) (internal quotation marks, brackets and ellipsis omitted). 
(2) The Circuit Court did not err in denying Tierney's
 
motion to dismiss on the basis of outrageous government conduct. 
Due process principles bar the government from invoking judicial
 process against a defendant to obtain a conviction when conduct
 of law enforcement officials "violates fundamental fairness or
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
shocks the conscience." State v. Agrabante, 73 Haw. 179, 186,
 
830 P.2d 492, 496 (1992); United States v. Russell, 411 U.S. 423,
 
431-32 (1973) ("we may some day be presented with [such] a
 situation").
 
Tierney, however, provided no objective evidence to the 
Circuit Court, or on appeal, in support of his claims of outrageous government behavior. Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure 
require that: 
An application to the court for an order shall be by
motion. . . . If a motion requires the consideration of
facts not appearing of record, it shall be supported by
affidavit or declaration.
 
Haw. R. Pen. P. 47(a) (2000). Having presented no affidavit or
 
declaration, and unable as a result to establish the factual
 basis for any of his claims, Tierney is unable to make a prima
 facie case showing that he is entitled to dismissal. See State
 
v. Almeida, 54 Haw. 443, 448, 509 P.2d 549, 552 (1973).
 
(3) The Circuit Court did not deny Tierney his right
 
to counsel. The record reflects that Tierney was offered counsel
 on several occasions, but that he voluntarily, knowingly and
 intelligently rejected that right. 
Tierney stated that he did "[n]ot really" understand
 
the charges and complained that "I feel that I'm being forced to
 represent myself because you guys aren't giving me counsel. 
First lawyer told me he's going to kill me, and this lawyer don't
 do nothing." The Circuit Court encouraged him to reconsider his
 decision, warning him that "it might be difficult to defend
 yourself if you don't understand the charges." Nevertheless,
 when asked whether he wanted another attorney to represent him,
 Tierney re-affirmed his decision stating, "No, I want to
 represent myself." After an extended colloquy with the court,
 Tierney stated that he understood the charges, and that he was
 waiving his right to counsel. 
Tierney stated that he was forty-nine years old, had
 
completed sixteen years of education, was able to read, write,
 and understand English, was not under treatment for mental
 illness or emotional disability, and his mind was clear of drugs
 and alcohol. Under such conditions, the right to counsel may be
 
3
    
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
waived. State v. Dicks, 57 Haw. 46, 48, 549 P.2d 727, 730 (1976)
 
(citing Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458 (1938)).
 
(4) The Circuit Court did not err by failing to
 
impanel a second jury pool. During jury voir dire, a prospective
 
juror stated, "Recently, I was a probation officer downstairs[,]"
 and "the defendant looks familiar to me." After a bench
 conference, the Circuit Court instructed the jury as follows:
 
All right, ladies and gentlemen, before we proceed,
[the prospective juror] had indicated that the defendant
looked familiar and the court has determined that Mister –
 Mr. Tierney has never been on probation in [the prospective
juror's] office. So you are to draw no inferences at all
from that comment. In fact, the court will strike that
comment from the record, and please do not consider that in
any way further in this case.
 
Following the presentation of the evidence, and prior to jury
 
deliberations, the Circuit Court again instructed the jury, "You
 must disregard entirely any matter which the court has ordered
 stricken." 
Jurors are presumed to follow the court's instructions. 
State v. Wakisaka, 102 Hawai
'i 504, 516, 78 P.3d 317, 329 (2003) 
(holding that courts will "consider a curative instruction sufficient to cure" any potential misconduct because "we presume that the jury heeds the court's instruction to disregard improper . . . comments"). In this case, Tierney failed to establish juror misconduct, much less any type of conduct that would rise to the level of substantial prejudice resulting in an unfair trial. Even if there had been misconduct, though, the Circuit Court properly instructed the jury to disregard anything the prospective juror may have said. 
(5) Sufficient evidence was presented to support
 
Tierney's conviction for theft in the second degree and burglary
 in the second degree. 
The material elements of theft in the second degree are 
that: (1) the defendant obtained or exerted unauthorized control over the property of another; (2) the defendant intended to deprive the other of his or her property; and (3) the value of the property exceeded $300. H
AW. REV. STAT. §§ 708-830(1), 708­
831(1)(b); see State v. Mitchell, 88 Hawai 'i 216, 222, 965 P.2d 
149, 155 (App. 1998). The material elements of burglary in the 
4
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
second degree are that the defendant: (1) intentionally entered
 
or remained unlawfully in a building; (2) with intent to commit a
 crime therein against a person or property rights. H
AW. REV.
 
STAT. § 708-811.  "A burglary conviction . . . can be based upon
 
a showing of intent to commit any crime." State v. Motta, 66
 
Haw. 89, 94, 657 P.2d 1019, 1022 (1983). 
Prosecution witnesses testified that: Coco Cove's back
 
room office was closed and limited to authorized employees;
 Tierney was not authorized to enter, but was seen leaving the
 office clutching something to his stomach; the safe in the office
 was open and cash was missing; Tierney struggled with the manager
 of Coco Cove and attempted to flee the store; Tierney was
 detained until police arrived; and Tierney was found with $1,141
 in cash, the same amount missing from the safe. 
When "viewed in the light most favorable to the 
prosecution and in full recognition of the province of the trier of fact," the evidence in this case "is sufficient to support a prima facie case so that a reasonable mind might fairly conclude guilt beyond a reasonable doubt" of both theft in the second degree and burglary in the second degree. See State v. Ferrer, 
95 Hawai
'i 409, 422, 23 P.3d 744, 757 (App. 2001) (quoting State 
v. Timoteo, 87 Hawai 'i 108, 112-13, 952 P.2d 865, 869-70 (1997). 
(6) The Circuit Court did not err by failing to call
 
Dr. Nathan Angle as a witness for the defense. Tierney presented
 no evidence, and has made no argument, suggesting that Dr.
 Angle's testimony would have been relevant to the charge of theft
 or burglary. State v. Savitz, 67 Haw. 59, 60-61, 677 P.2d 465,
 
466-67 (1984) (where defendant in criminal prosecution fails to
 show that witness' testimony would be relevant, material, and
 favorable to his defense, he cannot complain of violation of his
 right to compulsory process). Rather, Tierney wanted to call Dr.
 Angle who "treated [him] for a concussion because I don't
 remember what happened that day." 
"[T]he government is not a guarantor of a defense
 
witness' appearance at trial." State v. Bullen, 63 Haw. 27, 29,
 
620 P.2d 728, 729-30 (1980). The record reflects that the
 Circuit Court did not prevent Tierney from calling Dr. Angle to
 
5
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
testify; rather, Dr. Angle was unavailable when Tierney wanted
 
to call him.
 
(7) The cumulative effect of the aforementioned
 
alleged errors did not deny Tierney his constitutional right to
 due process or his right to a fair trial.  Since we conclude that
 
the Circuit Court did not err in its handling of the six
 
substantive points of error discussed above, we do not find any
 denial of due process or the right to a fair trial in the
 cumulative effect of the Circuit Court's decisions.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment filed on
 
October 27, 2009 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is
 affirmed.
