NO. 29995
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
DISCOVER BANK, a Delaware corporation,
Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
MILES T. TOMISATO, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
WAHIAWA DIVISION
 
(CIVIL NO. 1RC08-1-02382)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Miles T. Tomisato (Tomisato)

 
appeals from the Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary
 
Judgment, filed on August 3, 2009 in the District Court of the
 First Circuit, Wahiaw
a Division (District Court).1 On appeal,
 
Tomisato contends that the District Court erred by (1) striking
 his Motion to Strike Parts of Declaration of Robert Adkins, (2)
 applying the law of "account stated" to the proof of a single
 disputed item, (3) failing to set the "door closing statute"
 defense for trial, and (4) awarding attorney's fees without a
 showing that there was a binding express agreement that provided
 for them.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Tomisato's points of error as follows:

 The Honorable Barbara P. Richardson presided.
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1) Tomisato does not identify where in the record he
 
objected to the District Court striking his Motion to Strike
 
Parts of Declaration of Robert Adkins. When the District Court
 informed Tomisato that it would not consider his motion because
 it was filed one day before the hearing on Plaintiff-Appellee
 Discover Bank's motion for summary judgment, Tomisato said
 "Okay." Furthermore, Tomisato did not request at the hearing
 that any portion of Adkins' declaration be stricken. Therefore,
 this point of error will be disregarded. Haw. R. App. P.
 28(b)(4)(iii).
 
(2) Tomisato failed to present any argument for his
 
second point of error. In his reply brief, Tomisato admitted
 that "Appellee is correct that the second point is unsupported." 
Therefore, Tomisato's second point of error is waived. Haw. R.
 App. P. 28(b)(7). 
(3) Tomisato refers to a "door closing statute" defense 
in his third point of error, claiming that Discover Bank lacks capacity to sue him in the State of Hawai
'i. This claim is 
without merit. 
The fact that Discover Bank is not registered to do 
business in Hawai 'i is not disputed. Nevertheless, 
"[m]aintaining, defending, or settling any proceeding[,]" "[c]reating as borrower or lender . . . indebtedness," and "[s]ecuring or collecting debts" do not constitute transacting business for which a foreign corporation is required to obtain a certificate of authority. H
AW. REV. STAT. ยง 414-431(b)(1), (7) 
and (8) (1993). "It is well-established that a foreign corporation which is not required to register in Hawaii may nevertheless sue or be sued in the State's courts." Cowan v. 
First Ins. Co. of Hawaii, 61 Haw. 644, 648, n.3, 608 P.2d 394, 398, n.3 (1980) (citing Benham v. World Airways, Inc., 253 F. Supp. 588 (D. Haw. 1966)). 
(4) Tomisato does not identify where in the record he
 
objected to the award of attorney's fees to Discover Bank. 
Therefore, Tomisato's fourth point of error is disregarded. Haw.
 R. App. P. 28(b)(4)(iii). Even if the error is not disregarded,
 Discover Bank is not required to prove that Tomisato's agreement

with Discover Bank provided for an award of attorney's fees. 
Discover Bank's suit against Tomisato sought damages for
 Tomisato's failure to pay the amount owed on his credit card in
 accordance with an agreement between Discover Bank and Tomisato. 
"An action for the recovery of damages for non-performance of a
 contract is one in assumpsit." Rosa v. Johnston, 3 Haw. App.
 
420, 430, 651 P.2d 1228, 1236 (1982) (citing Braham v. Honolulu
 Amusement Co., 21 Haw. 583 (Haw. Terr. 1913)). 
Discover Bank's action was in the nature of assumpsit. 
Attorney's fees shall be taxed in all actions in the nature of
 assumpsit, up to a maximum of twenty-five percent of the
 judgment, to the prevailing party and against the losing party. 
H
AW. REV. STAT. ยง 607-14 (Supp. 2009). Discover Bank was the
 
prevailing party and Tomisato was the losing party. Therefore,
 Discover Bank is entitled to recover its attorney's fees. The
 amount of attorney's fees awarded to Discover Bank did not exceed
 twenty-five percent of the judgment.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Order Granting
 
Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment, filed on August 3, 2009
 in the District Court of the First Circuit, Wahiaw
a Division, is
 
affirmed.
