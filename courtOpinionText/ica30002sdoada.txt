JACQUELINE RIGSBY, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
WILLIAM E. RIGSBY, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D NO. 61854)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Jacqueline Rigsby ("Jacqueline"),
 
appearing pro se, appeals from the June 3, 2009 Order Re:
 
Defendant's Motion for Post-Decree Relief ("June 3, 2009 Order")
 entered in the Family Court of the First Circuit ("Family
 
1
Court")  which resolved Jacqueline's and Defendant-Appellee
William E. Rigsby's ("William") respective motions for post-
decree relief from the January 20, 1967 Final Decree of Divorce 
which terminated the parties' marriage. The June 3, 2009 Order
 denied William's request for termination of spousal support and
 offset spousal-support arrearages owed to Jacqueline. Jacqueline
 filed a motion for reconsideration of the June 3, 2009 Order,
 which was denied by an order of the Family Court dated July 14,
 2009.
 
On appeal, Jacqueline asserts ten points of error,
 
which can be summarized as follows:
 
1 The Honorable Linda K. C. Luke presided.
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(1) The Family Court erred by determining that William was
entitled to rental offsets because there is no evidence
 to support William's claim of Jacqueline's tenancy, and
Jacqueline offered substantial evidence proving
otherwise;
 
(2) The Family Court erred by failing to consider
Jacqueline's claim for reimbursement of education and
dental expenditures, which were incurred in response to
William's actions.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 conclude that Jacqueline did not meet her burden of demonstrating
 error, and we, therefore, affirm the Family Court's decision.

An appellant who desires to raise any point on appeal 
that requires consideration of the oral proceedings before the court appealed from bears the burden to show error by reference to matters in the record, and must provide the relevant transcript. See Haw. R. App. P. 10 (2008); see also Union Bldg. 
Materials Corp. v. The Kakaako Corp., 5 Haw. App. 146, 151, 682 P.2d 82, 87 (1984) (citing State v. Goers, 61 Haw. 198, 600 P.2d 1142 (1979)). "The burden is upon appellant in an appeal to show error by reference to matters in the record, and he [or she] has the responsibility of providing an adequate transcript." Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai' i 225, 231, 909 P.2d 553, 
559 (1995) (quoting Union Bldg. Materials Corp., 5 Haw. App. at 151, 682 P.2d at 87) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
On appeal, Jacqueline relies extensively on her

findings of fact and conclusions of law. Haw. Fam. Ct. R. 52(a). Under the
 
circumstances of this case, however, we conclude that the Family Court's error
is not a basis for remand.

characterization of the testimony and other evidence presented to
 
the Family Court at the hearing. As such, in the absence of the
 hearing transcript, Jacqueline failed to demonstrate error. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that we affirm the June 3, 2009
 Order.
