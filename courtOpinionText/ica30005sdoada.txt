APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 

 (CIVIL NO. 07-1-0223(3))
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Clayton Gomes (Gomes or Plaintiff)
 
appeals from the Judgment filed on July 22, 2009 in the Circuit
 
1
Court of the Second Circuit  (circuit court).  The circuit court
 
entered judgment in favor of Defendant-Appellee State of Hawaii,
 
Department of Public Safety (State or Defendant) and against
 
Gomes on all causes of action asserted in Gomes's First Amended
 
Complaint pursuant to the July 8, 2009 "Order Granting Defendant
 
State of Hawaii, Department of Public Safety's Motion to Dismiss
 
Amended Complaint Filed on January 18, 2008, or in the
 
Alternative for Summary Judgment, Filed on March 20, 2009" (Order
 
Granting SJ). The circuit court granted summary judgment in
 
favor of the State as to counts two and three (medical

malpractice and breach of contract, respectively) of Gomes's
 
First Amended Complaint and dismissed count one (negligence). 
On appeal, Gomes raises only one point of error: the
 
circuit court erroneously granted the State's motion to dismiss
 
count one of his First Amended Complaint.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Gomes's
 
point of error as follows:
 
Gomes's negligence claim against the State is barred by
 
the statute of limitations. Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 662­
4 (1993). Gomes filed his complaint on June 21, 2007, seeking
 
damages for injuries he suffered on January 13, 2004 when he
 
slipped and fell while trying to get down from his bunk at Maui
 
Community Correctional Center, where he was an inmate. Gomes
 
filed his complaint after the two-year statute of limitations had
 
run, and contrary to Gomes's assertions, his negligence claim was
 
not tolled under the (1) the continuing treatment doctrine, (2)
 
the discovery rule, or (3) equitable tolling.
 
(1) HRS § 662-4, a waiver of sovereign immunity, is 
strictly construed. Office of Hawaiian Affairs v. State, 110 
Hawai'i 338, 360, 133 P.3d 767, 789 (2006) (courts must strictly 
construe statutes that put specific limits on State's waiver of 
sovereign immunity); Whittington v. State, 72 Haw. 77, 806 P.2d 
957 (1991) (tolling extensions allowed under Chapter 657 are not 
applicable to actions brought against the State under HRS Chapter 
662). HRS § 662-4 states in plain language that a "tort claim 
against the State shall be forever barred unless action is begun 
within two years after the claim accrues, except in the case of a 
medical tort claim when the limitation of action provisions set 
forth in section 657-7.3 shall apply." Here, Gomes is alleging 
negligence, not a medical tort claim.

(2) The discovery rule does not toll Gomes's
 
negligence claim because at the time of his injury, he was aware
 
of the negligent act, the damage, and the causal connection. 
(3) "The application of the doctrine of equitable
 
estoppel against the government is not favored." Turner v.
 
Chandler, 87 Hawai 'i 330, 333, 955 P.2d 1062, 1065 (App. 1998). 
Gomes argues that extraordinary circumstances
 
caused him to delay filing suit. . . . [H]e was waiting for
the Department of Public Safety to fix his back from the
injury the Department itself had caused. It was not his
 fault that the Department waited 18 months to finally give
him an operation, and until then the statute of limitations
was tolled because he did not have the "vital information"
 that said operation would be unsuccessful and he would be
left with physical limitations and pain. 
Gomes could have brought his negligence claim within 
the two-year statute of limitations. Therefore, his equitable 
tolling argument is without merit. Hays v. City & County of 
Honolulu, 81 Hawai 'i 391, 398, 917 P.2d 718, 725 (1996). 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment filed on
 
July 22, 2009 in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit is
 affirmed.
