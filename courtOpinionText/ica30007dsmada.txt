NO. 30007
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
IN THE INTEREST OF A.B., III
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(FC-J NO. 0071480)
ORDER GRANTING DECEMBER 28, 2009 MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL
(By:  Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
Upon review of (1) the December 28, 2009 motion to
dismiss the instant appeal (No. 30007) filed by Deputy Public
Defender Taryn R. Tomasa (Tomasa), counsel for A.B., III (A.B.),
Minor-Appellant; (2) the lack of any response by Petitioner-
Appellee State of Hawai# i; and (3) the record, it appears that
although we have appellate jurisdiction over A.B.'s appeal from
the Honorable Karen M. Radius's July 16, 2009 decree adjudicating
A.B. as a law violator within the purview of Hawaii Revised
Statutes (HRS) ยง 571-11(1) (2006) as to the crime of Harassment,
in violation of HRS ยง 711-1106 (Supp. 2008), Tomasa, declares in
a supporting declaration that it appears A.B. has abandoned
No. 30007, and, thus, Tomasa prays that we dismiss No. 30007
pursuant to Rule 42(b) of the Hawai #i Rules of Appellate
Procedure (HRAP).  According to Tomasa's declaration, she has
made diligent efforts to communicate with A.B. by way of
telephone, certified mail, and A.B.'s mother in order to discuss
whether A.B. wants to obtain appellate review of the July 16,
2009 decree.  Tomasa declares that A.B. has not responded to her
communications regarding the issue of No. 30007.  Despite
diligent efforts, Tomasa has also been unable to locate A.B. for
the purpose of obtaining A.B.'s affidavit or declaration that
reflects A.B.'s knowing and intelligent understanding of the
consequences of the dismissal of No. 30007 and that A.B. is2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
voluntarily making the withdrawal of No. 30007.  Therefore, it
appears that Tomasa has complied with the requirements under HRAP
Rule 42(c) for the dismissal of No. 30007 pursuant to HRAP Rule
42(b).  Accordingly,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the December 28, 2009 motion
by Tomasa to dismiss No. 30007 is granted, and appeal No. 30007
is dismissed.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, January 28, 2010.

for A.B., III, Minor-Appellant.
