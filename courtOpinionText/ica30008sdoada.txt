STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
DAVID ISAO KEAO, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

 
(CR. NO. 08-1-1778)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER

 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant David Isao Keao (Keao) appeals from
 
the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence (judgment) entered by the
 
1
Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court)  on June 30,
2009, sentencing Keao to five years of incarceration for
 
violating Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291C-12.5 (2007 Repl.)
 (Accidents Involving Substantial Bodily Injury) and to thirty
 days incarceration for violating HRS § 286-102 (2007 Repl.)
 (Driving Without a License).
2 Keao also appeals from the circuit
 
court's order entered on July 27, 2009 denying Keao's Motion for
 Reconsideration of Sentence, or in the Alternative, Motion to
 
1
 The Honorable Randal K. O. Lee presided.
 
2 The offense of Accidents Involving Substantial Bodily Injury is a
class C felony carrying a maximum length of imprisonment of five years. HRS §
706-660 (1993). The offense of Driving Without a License carries a maximum
prison sentence of thirty days. HRS § 286-136(a) (2007).
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Withdraw No Contest Plea and to Reset Case for Trial, which Keao 
had brought pursuant to Hawai 'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) 
Rule 35 (2003) and HRPP Rule 32(d) (2006). 
Keao pled no contest to driving a vehicle on May 24,
 
2008, when he was involved in an accident resulting in
 substantial bodily injury to another person and failed to
 immediately stop and fulfill the requirements of HRS § 291C-14
 (1993). He also pled no contest to operating the vehicle without
 a license. 
On appeal, Keao raises three points of error in
 
challenging the circuit court's imposition of the maximum
 sentences: (1) the circuit court erred in considering his "post
 bad act" of driving without a license, because Keao claims it was
 an "uncharged crime" that should not have been considered as part
 of his sentencing; (2) the circuit court erred in considering
 information about his poor probation history in connection with a
 prior offense on Maui, because this violated his constitutional
 rights of confrontation and due process, as well as the rule of
 law that a person must be sentenced for the acts which he
 presently committed; (3) the circuit court abused its discretion
 in not granting his post-sentence request to withdraw his no
 contest plea, because prior defense counsel had communicated to
 Keao that he would receive probation with the possibility of
 weekends in jail and, further, Keao claims he did not admit to
 the allegations of the Complaint at the sentencing hearing.

Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai 'i (State) argues that 
this court lacks jurisdiction because Keao's Notice of Appeal, filed on August 14, 2009, was untimely under Hawai
'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 4(b)(1) (2009). The State further argues that the circuit court's order dated July 27, 2009

 Keao has not asserted ineffective assistance of counsel as an issue
 
on appeal. Therefore, we address the effectiveness of prior defense counsel's
actions only as it pertains to jurisdiction.
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
is not an appealable post-judgment order under HRS § 641-11
 
(Supp. 2009).
 
As a threshold matter, we address the jurisdictional 
questions. First, we determine that this court has jurisdiction 
to entertain Keao's appeal from the circuit court's June 30, 2009 judgment because, although the Notice of Appeal was not filed within thirty days of the judgment, Keao's prior defense counsel "inexcusably or ineffectively" failed to pursue Keao's appeal and did not timely file a Notice of Appeal. State v. Knight, 80 
Hawai
'i 318, 323, 909 P.2d 1133, 1138 (1996) (explaining that "we 
have permitted belated appeals under [certain] circumstances, namely, when . . . defense counsel has inexcusably or ineffectively failed to pursue a defendant's appeal from a criminal conviction in the first instance[.]") (citation omitted) (brackets and ellipses in original); State v. Erwin, 57 Haw. 268, 269, 554 P.2d 236, 238 (1976); see also, State v. Irvine, 88 Hawai
'i 404, 407, 967 P.2d 236, 239 (1998). Second, we have 
jurisdiction to review the circuit court's July 27, 2009 order denying Keao's motion, brought in part pursuant to HRPP Rule 35, for reconsideration of sentence or in the alternative to withdraw no-contest plea and reset case for trial. See State v. 
Guillermo, 91 Hawai
'i 307, 308, 983 P.2d 819, 820 (1999) 
(exercising jurisdiction to review a defendant's appeal "from the circuit court's denial of his motion for re-sentencing filed . . . pursuant to [HRPP] Rule 35"); see also State v. De Guair, 108 Hawai
'i 179, 118 P.3d 662 (2005); State v. Kamanao, 
103 Hawai 'i 315, 82 P.3d 401 (2003); State v. Brantley, 99 Hawai 'i 
463, 56 P.3d 1252 (2002). 
With respect to the merits of Keao's appeal, upon
 
careful review of the record and the briefs submitted by the
 parties and having given due consideration to the arguments
 advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Keao's points of error
 as follows:
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
1. Keao incorrectly contends that the circuit court 
sentenced him based in part on "uncharged offenses, i.e., driving 
without a license on a different date from the date of May 24, 2008 in the instant case." Rather, the Presentence Diagnosis and Report (Presentence Report) relied upon by the circuit court establishes that, two months after the current incident, Keao was again arrested for Driving Without a License and that he subsequently pled guilty as charged. At the sentencing hearing in this case, both the State and the defense acknowledged having received the Presentence Report and made no additions or corrections to it. We conclude that Keao's subsequent guilty plea to Driving Without a License, reflected in the Presentence Report, was "highly relevant" information that the circuit court was entitled to consider in determining an appropriate sentence. Keawe v. State, 79 Hawai
'i 281, 288, 901 P.2d 481, 488 (1995) 
(holding that a subsequent conviction could be considered in sentencing, and stating that "an updated presentence report containing information about the defendant's conduct which occurred subsequent to an original sentencing hearing is highly relevant to individualizing a particular sentence to a particular defendant"). 
2. The circuit court did not err in considering Keao's
 
poor probation history for a prior offense, as reflected in the
 Presentence Report. Although Keao contends on appeal that he
 should have been given an opportunity to cross-examine the
 probation officer involved in the prior offense "to contest the
 alleged 'poor' probation on Maui," we note again that the
 contents of the Presentence Report were not challenged at the
 
4
sentencing hearing. Moreover, HRS § 706-606 (1993)  requires the
4
 HRS § 706-606 provides as follows:
 
§706-606 Factors to be considered in imposing a sentence.  
The court, in determining the particular sentence to be imposed,
shall consider:
 
(1) The nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and
characteristics of the defendant;
 

 (continued...)

      NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
sentencing judge to take into account the "history and 
characteristics of the defendant[.]" See Keawe, 79 Hawai 'i at 
285, 901 P.2d at 485 ("when exercising its broad discretion to 
impose any particular sentence so as to fit the punishment to the 
offense as well as the needs of the individual defendant and the 
community, the sentencing court [is] obligated to consider the 
HRS § 706-606 'factors' as part of its decision making process") 
(quoting State v. Gaylord, 78 Hawai 'i 127, 149, 890 P.2d 1167, 
1189 (1995)) (brackets in original).
3. The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in 
denying Keao's request, made post-sentence, to withdraw his no 
contest plea. In this circumstance, "only a showing of manifest injustice will entitle the defendant to withdraw his or her plea" and a trial court's denial of such a motion "will not be disturbed on appeal unless abuse of discretion is clearly shown." State v. Kido, 109 Hawai
'i 458, 461, 128 P.3d 340, 343 (2006); 
see also HRPP Rule 32(d). Although Keao contends that he relied on the circuit court's stated intention regarding sentencing, which Keao claims his counsel communicated to him to be probation with some jail possible on weekends, the record does not support this claim. First, at the change of plea hearing, Keao confirmed that he had not been made any promises in return for his no

(2) The need for the sentence imposed:
(a) To reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote
respect for law, and to provide just punishment for the
offense;
(b) To afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;
(c) To protect the public from further crimes of the defendant;
and 
(d) To provide the defendant with needed educational or
vocational training, medical care, or other correctional
treatment in the most effective manner;
(3) The kinds of sentences available; and
(4) The need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among
defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of
similar conduct.

contest plea.5 Second, the circuit court made a specific finding
 
that it made no promises as to sentencing. Rather, during a pre­
trial conference, the circuit court informed Keao's counsel that
 the court would consider probation with possible jail on weekends
 only if the defense presented evidence that Keao had stopped
 after the subject accident and had called 911 for help, as the
 defense claimed. In other words, although it was uncontested
 
that Keao did flee the scene in violation of HRS § 291C-12.5, the
 
circuit court indicated that if Keao initially stopped and called
 
911, those would be mitigating factors for sentencing purposes. 
The defense thereafter made efforts to obtain evidence, but could
 not show at the time of sentencing that Keao had stopped and
 called 911 after the accident.
 
We also disagree with Keao's argument relying on
 
State v. Smith, 61 Haw. 522, 606 P.2d 86 (1980), that because he
 continued to assert at sentencing that he initially stopped and
 called 911, the trial court should have allowed him to withdraw
 his no contest plea after the sentence was imposed. Keao did not
 protest his innocence while pleading no contest. That is, he did
 
5 At the change of plea hearing, the following is part of the exchange
between the circuit court and Keao:
 
Q.	 Do you understand that by pleading no contest, there
will be no trial, I will in essence find you guilty
and sentence you without a trial?
 
A.	 Yes.
 
Q.	 Do you understand that after you are sentenced, you
cannot come back and say I want my trial because I
didn't like the sentence I got?
 
A.	 Yes, sir.
 
. . .
 
Q.	 Are you pleading no contest of your own free will?
 
A.	 Yes, I am.
 
Q.	 Has anyone made any promises to you in return for your
no contest plea?
 
A.	 No.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
not challenge the fact that he did ultimately flee the scene of
 
the accident without meeting the requirements of HRS § 291C-14,
 which is the basis for violating HRS § 291C-12.5. As noted
 above, if Keao initially stopped and called 911 before leaving
 the scene, those would be mitigating factors for sentencing. 
However, they would not be defenses to the charged offense. 
Further, Keao sought to withdraw his no contest plea after his
 sentence was imposed. For these reasons, Smith is not
 applicable.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the circuit court's June 30,
 
2009 judgment, as well as the July 27, 2009 order denying Keao's
 Motion for Reconsideration of Sentence, or in the Alternative,
 Motion to Withdraw No Contest Plea and to Reset Case for Trial,
 are both affirmed.
