OF THE STATE OF HAWAI #I
STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
JORDAN N. KOTANI, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
HONOLULU DIVISION
(Case No. 1DTC-08-057813)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Jordan N. Kotani (Kotani) appeals
from the Judgment entered on July 21, 2009 in the District Court
of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (district court).1
Kotani was convicted of Excessive Speeding, in
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 291C-105(a)(1) (1993
& Supp. 2009). 
On appeal, Kotani contends the district court erred by
admitting the laser-gun reading into evidence over his objection
because it lacked proper foundation in accordance with State v.
Assaye, 121 Hawai# i 204, 216 P.3d 1227 (2009).
The State of Hawai# i (State) concedes there was
insufficient evidence to convict Kotani of Excessive Speeding,
but argues there was sufficient evidence to support a finding for
the State with respect to the included traffic infraction of
Speeding, in violation of HRS ยง 291C-102(a)(1) (1993).
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Kotani's
points of error as follows:NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2There was insufficient evidence to convict Kotani of
Excessive Speeding because the State failed to adduce evidence
that the laser gun was tested according to the manufacturer
recommended procedures in order to establish sufficient
foundation for the laser gun reading.  Assaye, 121 Hawai #i at
214, 216 P.3d at 1237.  Without this evidence, there was
insufficient evidence to support Kotani's conviction for
Excessive Speeding.
The State's reliance upon Officer Kam's testimony that
he saw Kotani's car "pulling away from the other vehicles" does
not provide sufficient proof that Kotani was traveling in excess
of the posted speed limit of 45 miles per hour.  Therefore, there
is also insufficient evidence that Kotani violated HRS ยง 291C-
102.
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment entered on
July 21, 2009, in the District Court of the First Circuit,
Honolulu Division, is reversed.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, June 21, 2010.
