IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
JEFFREY R. BLAGUS, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT

 
(CRIMINAL NO. 06-1-0424(2))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER

 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
  
Defendant-Appellant Jeffrey R. Blagus (Blagus) appeals

 
from the Order of Resentencing/Revocation of Probation issued by
 
the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (circuit court)1 on
 
July 23, 2009, resentencing Blagus to five years in prison with
 credit for time served for violating his probation. 
On appeal, Blagus contends that (1) the circuit court
 
abused its discretion in revoking his probation because he used
 marijuana, despite evidence of medical need, and (2) it was
 plainly erroneous for a judge other than the trial judge to
 preside over his probation revocation hearing.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Blagus's
 points of error as follows:
 
I.	 THE CIRCUIT COURT DID NOT ABUSE ITS DISCRETION IN REVOKING
 
BLAGUS'S PROBATION
 
In Hawai
'i, a court "shall revoke probation if the 
defendant has inexcusably failed to comply with a substantial 
requirement imposed as a condition of the [probation] order or has been convicted of a felony." H
AW. REV. STAT. § 706-625 (Supp.

 The Honorable Shackley F. Raffetto presided over Blagus's July 23,
2009 probation revocation hearing and resentencing.

 The Honorable Richard T. Bissen, Jr. presided over Blagus's

original sentencing.

2009). See State v. Lazar, 82 Hawai 'i 441, 443, 922 P.2d 1054, 
1056 (App. 1996) (affirming probation revocation when defendant 
left drug rehabilitation program in order to see his ex-wife after receiving divorce papers); State v. Nakamura, 59 Haw. 378, 581 P.2d 759 (1978) (reversing probation revocation based upon defendant's failure to report to third-party substance abuse treatment center for a few hours after being released from prison). 
"[P]robation has historically been regarded as 'a
 
matter of grace or privilege and not a matter of right.'" State
 
v. Vincent, No. 27357, 2009 WL 120308, at *2 (Hawai
'i App. Jan. 
20, 2009) (citing State v. Bernades, 71 Haw. 485, 489, 795 P.2d 842, 846 (1990)). "Whether probation should be granted, revoked, or modified lies solely within the discretion of the sentencing court. The only question before this court on review is whether or not there has been an abuse of that judicial discretion." State v. Huggett, 55 Haw. 632, 635, 525 P.2d 1119, 1122 (1974). "[W]here the record reflects justifiable cause for the revocation or the modification of probation terms, the trial court's determination will be sustained." Id. at 636, 525 P.2d at 1122 
(probation modification of ten months' jail confinement vacated when probationer moved to Hilo without informing his probation officer in violation of his probation terms). 
Blagus was prohibited "from the use of alcohol or any 
narcotic drug or controlled substance without a prescription" by the terms of previous probation orders issued in 2007 and 2008.

Marijuana is a Schedule I, Controlled Substance under Hawai 'i 
law. H AW. REV. STAT. § 329-14(d)(20) (Supp. 2009). As such, 
Blagus's October 2008 and January 2009 use of marijuana amounted

 Blagus was initially sentenced on March 9, 2007 to five years
probation after pleading no contest to the charge of terroristic threatening
in the first degree. (2007 Probation Order) According to the court, Blagus's
record showed sixteen prior convictions. Included among the terms of his 2007
Probation Order was a requirement that he refrain from using alcohol or any
narcotic drug or controlled substance without a prescription. On October 29,
2008, Blagus tested positive for and admitted to using marijuana. On October
 31, 2008, Judge Raffetto presided over a hearing on the State's request to
modify or revoke Blagus's probation. On November 12, 2008, Judge Raffetto
found that Blagus had inexcusably failed to comply with the terms of his
probation and modified his sentence to include fourteen days of incarceration.
(2008 Probation Modification Order)

to violations of the 2007 Probation Order and 2008 Probation
 
Modification Order, respectively. 
While Blagus concedes that he violated the 2007
 
Probation Order and the 2008 Probation Modification Order, he
 contends that the evidence establishes that he "qualified for
 medical marijuana" under chapter 329, Hawaii Revised Statutes,
 and that, as such, his "actions do not rise to the level of
 inexcusable or substantial, the statutory requirement to revoke
 probation." We disagree. 
A court may revoke a defendant's probation based on the 
defendant's violation of a probationary term prohibiting drug or alcohol use. See State v. Perry, 93 Hawai
'i 189, 192-194, 998 
P.2d 70, 73-75 (App. 2000) (probation revocation was proper when defendant had, among other things, used marijuana in violation of the terms of his probation); Vincent, 2009 WL 120308 at *2 (the medical-use-of-marijuana law "does not prohibit a court from imposing conditions prohibiting marijuana use on a person sentenced for a drug offense"). Blagus neither established an entitlement to the medical use of marijuana, H
AW. REV. STAT. 
§ 329-122(a) (Supp. 2009), nor did he petition the court to amend the terms of his probation. 
In sum, Blagus failed to comply with a substantial
 
requirement imposed as a condition of his probation when he
 tested positive for the use of marijuana. His failure to comply
 with the requirement that he refrain from the use of any
 controlled substance without a prescription was inexcusable under
 the circumstances. As a result, the circuit court did not abuse
 its discretion in revoking Blagus's probation.
 
II.	 IT WAS NOT PLAINLY ERRONEOUS FOR A JUDGE OTHER THAN THE
 
TRIAL JUDGE TO RESENTENCE BLAGUS
 
It was not plainly erroneous for Judge Raffetto to 
preside over Blagus's 2009 probation revocation hearing. 
Although, in the Hawai
'i circuit courts, "the sentencing judge is 
generally also the trial judge," State v. Valera, 74 Haw. 424, 432 n.5, 848 P.2d 376, 380 n.5 (1993), variation from this general practice under the circumstances does not "seriously 
3
   
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial 
proceedings, to serve the ends of justice, and to prevent the denial of fundamental rights." State v. Vanstory, 91 Hawai
'i 33, 
42, 979 P.2d 1059, 1068 (1999) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting State v. Sawyer, 88 Hawai
'i 325, 330, 966 P.2d 637, 642 
(1998). 
In addition, a probation revocation hearing is 
fundamentally different from an initial sentencing hearing. Both Valera and Rule 25(b), Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure,4 
illustrate that the practice of the trial judge conducting the sentencing applies to the initial sentencing. An initial sentence is based, in large part, on information provided and determined during trial. See Valera, 74 Haw. at 436, 848 P.2d at 
381 ("A sentencing judge is still required to impose a 'fair, proper, and just sentence,' based upon the crime of which the defendant was convicted . . . [based upon] the evidence presented at trial." (citation omitted)); H
AW. REV. STAT. § 706-606(1)-(2) 
(1993). 
Probation revocation, on the other hand, is largely
 
based on the subsequent actions of the probationer, with the
 merits of the underlying sentence assumed. See State v. Viloria,
 
70 Haw. 58, 61-62, 759 P.2d 1376, 1378-79 (1988) (generally,
 probation violation requiring revocation of probation "indicates
 that the probationer has not yet received the full rehabilitative
 benefit that probation is designed to induce"); Huggett, 55 Haw.
 at 635, 525 P.2d at 1122 (defendant's "post-sentencing conduct is
 always a relevant factor in revocation or modification
 proceedings"); H
AW. REV. STAT. § 706-625(3).

 The rules of penal procedure provide:
 
"If by reason of absence from the State, death, sickness or
other disability, including retirement or disqualification, the
judge before whom the defendant has been tried is unable to
perform the duties to be performed by the court after a verdict or
finding of guilt, any other judge regularly sitting in or assigned
to the court may perform those duties; but if such other judge is
satisfied tht he cannot perform those duties because he did not
preside at the trial or for any other reason, he may in his
discretion grant a new trial.
 
Haw. R. Pen. P. 25(b) (1977).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
In this case, there was no "trial judge" as Blagus pled
 
no contest to the original charge and subsequently admitted to
 
the probation violations. There is no evidence that the pre-
sentencing reports, including the bail study and the presentence
 diagnosis report, which are a part of the record on appeal, were
 unavailable to Judge Raffetto. In addition, Judge Raffetto
 conducted an evidentiary hearing on the order to show cause
 before revoking Blagus's probation. Thus, it was not plainly
 erroneous for Judge Raffetto to preside over the 2009 probation
 revocation/modification proceeding. 
III. CONCLUSION
 
For the foregoing reasons, the circuit court's July 23,
 
2009 Order of Resentencing/Revocation of Probation is affirmed.
