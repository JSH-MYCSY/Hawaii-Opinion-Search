STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
WAYNETTE W. BOTELHO, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
#EWA DIVISION
(Case No. 1DTC-08-052143)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Waynette W. Botelho (Botelho)
appeals the judgment, entered on July 1, 2009, in the District
Court of the First Circuit, # Ewa Division (district court).1
Botelho was convicted of Excessive Speeding, in
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 291C-105 (2007 and
Supp. 2009).
On appeal,2 Botelho contends the district court erred
by (1) denying her Motion to Compel and (2) convicting her based
on  insufficient evidence to establish the accuracy of the laser
gun in accordance with State v. Assaye, 121 Hawai #i 204, 216 P.3d
1227 (2009).  The State agrees that there was insufficient
foundation for the laser gun reading under Assaye.
Based on our review of the evidence presented, we
conclude there was insufficient evidence that the laser gun was
tested according to the manufacturer's recommended procedures in
order to establish sufficient foundation for the laser gun
reading.  Assaye, 121 Hawai# i at 214, 216 P.3d at 1237.  Without
this evidence, there was insufficient evidence to supportNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2Botelho's conviction for Excessive Speeding.  We need not address
Botelho's other point of error.  
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the judgment, entered on
July 1, 2009, in the District Court of the First Circuit, # Ewa
Division is reversed.
