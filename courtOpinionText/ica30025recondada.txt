NO. 30025
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
DEAN YOUNG, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
 
DAN DUDDEN, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(CIVIL CASE NO. 1RC08-1-9942)

 
ORDER DENYING PLAINTIFF-APPELLANT'S
 
MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER

 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the "Motion for Reconsideration
 
of [the March 7, 2011] Summary Disposition Order" filed on
 
March 21, 2011 by Plaintiff-Appellant Dean Young (Young) and the
 
records and files in this case, we conclude that Young's
 
contention that the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu
 
Division, (district court) improperly awarded attorney's fees and
 
costs against him was waived. Prior to the end of trial, Young
 
and Defendant-Appellee Dan Dudden (Dudden) were instructed by the
 
district court that if Dudden sought fees and costs, Dudden was
 
to file a motion for fees and costs no later than July 31, 2009
 
and Young must respond by August 20, 2009. Young was served with
 
a copy of a motion for fees and costs by Dudden on July 31, 2009. 
Dudden claimed that he should be awarded attorney's fees and

costs pursuant to HRS ยง 607-14 because Young's main claim was for 
bailment, which is in the nature of assumpsit. There is nothing 
in the record on appeal to indicate that Young opposed Dudden's 
motion for fees and costs. Dudden's motion for fees and costs 
was subsequently granted by the district court. Young does not 
point to where in the record he objected to Dudden's motion for 
fees and costs based upon his argument that his suit was not in 
the nature of assumpsit. Therefore, the point of error is 
waived. Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(4). 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawaii, March 28, 2011.

Dean Young,
Plaintiff-Appellant pro se.
