DEAN YOUNG, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
 
DAN DUDDEN, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(CIVIL CASE NO. 1RC08-1-9942)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Dean Young (Young) appeals from the
 
Judgment filed on August 27, 2009 in the District Court of the
 
First Circuit, Honolulu Division (district court).1
 
After a bench trial, the district court entered
 
judgment in favor of Defendant-Appellee Dan Dudden (Dudden) and
 
against Young on Young's claims of bailment, conversion, and
 
interference with prospective business advantage. The district
 
court also awarded attorney's fees and costs to Dudden from
 
Young.
 
On appeal, Young contends the district court erred by
 
(1) concluding there was no bailment between himself and Dudden,
 
(2) concluding there was no conversion by Dudden, (3) concluding

that Dudden did not interfere with Young's prospective business
 
advantage, (4) concluding that Young did not incur any damages,
 
(5) concluding that the Landlord-Tenant Code applied, (6) ruling
 
that Young failed to state an exception to the hearsay rule to
 
prove a conversation between a witness and a business associate,
 
and (7) awarding attorney's fees and costs to Dudden. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude that
 
Young's appeal is without merit.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the Judgment filed on
 
August 27, 2009 in the District Court of the First Circuit,
 Honolulu Division, is affirmed.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
