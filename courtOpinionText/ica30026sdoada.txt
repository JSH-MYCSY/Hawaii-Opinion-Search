STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
NICHOLAS KEOLA CHAR, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

(CASE NO. 5DTA-09-00109)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Nicholas Keola Char (Char) appeals 
from the July 30, 2009 Judgment convicting and sentencing him for 
Operating a Vehicle While Under the Influence of Intoxicants 
(OVUII) in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E­
61(a)(3) (2007) entered by the District Court of the Fifth 
Circuit, L lhu'e Division (district court).1 
As his sole point on appeal, Char maintains that the
 
district court "erroneously determined that the state complied

 The Honorable Trudy K. Senda entered the judgment appealed from.
 
Pursuant to a plea agreement, Char entered a conditional plea of
no contest to the OVUII charge, in exchange for dismissal of the other
offenses against him and preservation of his right to appeal from the denial
of his motion to suppress evidence. The district court dismissed with
 prejudice the remaining charges, Inattention to Driving in violation of HRS
§ 291-12 (Supp. 2010), Conditions of Operation and Registration of Motor
Vehicles in violation of HRS § 431:10C-104 (2005), and Reckless Driving in
violation of HRS § 291-2 (2007).
 I, J.MILLER K—115, a Police Officer, swear that the
 
following statements were read to the arrestee/respondent:
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
with Hawai[ ']i's implied consent law."2 After a careful review 
of the issue raised by Char, along with the arguments made by the 
parties, the record in this case, and the relevant authority, we 
resolve Char's point on appeal as follows. 
The version of Hawai 'i's implied consent law in effect 
at the time of the incident in question provided 
Refusal to submit to breath, blood, or urine test; subject
to administrative revocation proceedings.  If a person under
arrest refuses to submit to a breath, blood, or urine test,
none shall be given, except as provided in section 291E-21.
Upon the law enforcement officer's determination that the
person under arrest has refused to submit to a breath,
blood, or urine test, if applicable, then a law enforcement
officer shall:
 
(1)	 Inform the person under arrest of the sanctions
under section 291E-41 or 291E-65; and
 
(2)	 Ask the person if the person still refuses to
submit to a breath, blood, or urine test,
thereby subjecting the person to the procedures
and sanctions under part III or section 291E-65,
as applicable;
 
provided that if the law enforcement officer fails to comply
with paragraphs (1) and (2), the person shall not be subject
to the refusal sanctions under part III or section 291E-65.
 
HRS § 291E-15 (2007). As Char admits, subsequent to his arrest
 
in this case, he indicated to the arresting officer that he was
 
willing to take a breath test and that he was subsequently
 
administered a breath test.

 The form is entitled "USE OF INTOXICANTS WHILE OPERATING A VEHICLE

. . . .
I, THE ARRESTEE/RESPONDENT, ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I MADE THE
CHOICE(S) INDICATED ABOVE AND WAS INFORMED OF THE
INFORMATION IN THIS REPORT.
It appears that Char initialed the first choice (" AGREED TO TAKE A
BREATH TEST AND REFUSED A BLOOD TEST") and signed the acknowledgment on
the bottom of the form.
On appeal, Char argues that the choices presented to
him in the Form do not correctly state the implied consent law
and are confusing because (1) a person who wishes to take a
breath test does not necessarily "refuse" to take a blood test
and vice versa; (2) information given at the top of a form which
says, "if you refuse to submit to a breath or blood test, or
both, none shall be given, . . . but you shall be subject to []
procedures and sanctions" implies that selection of an option
that refuses only one method of testing triggers the warnings and
procedures mandated for refusal to submit to all methods of
testing; and (3) administration of the breath test afterNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
selection of the option to take the breath test while refusing
 
the blood test contradicts the information that if one refuses a
 
test, "none shall be given."
 
Char's arguments are without merit. First, the four
 
choices given to him on the Form covered the gamut of his options
 
and were not confusing. If he wished only to take the breath
 
test, he correctly marked the form. If he wished to take both
 
tests, that option was plainly presented. If he had not decided
 
whether he wished to take the blood test as well as the breath
 
test, the option he chose instructed the officer to administer
 
the method he did agree to take without forcing him to take the
 
blood test before he had affirmatively chosen to do so.
 
Second, when read in context, the information given on
 
the form was not inconsistent with the options provided. See
 
e.g., State v. Maluia, 56 Haw. 428, 539 P.2d 1200 (1975) (taking
 the challenged language in a "Miranda" rights warning form in
 
context with other language in the form in concluding the warning
 
was adequately clear). To the extent the language "if you refuse
 
to submit to a breath or blood test, or both, none shall be
 
given" could be construed to mean that refusal of any testing
 
method would mean no method would be administered, that reading
 
was clarified by the options provided on the Form. The four
 
options presented demonstrated that any combination of testing
 
methods was available. Otherwise, there would be no need to
 
provide the option to refuse both testing methods, because a
 
refusal of any one testing method would trigger sanctions and the
 
decision to submit to one method was irrelevant. 
Finally, Char's third argument is irrelevant to the
 
question of whether the Form was a correct statement of the law
 
or was confusing to an arrestee. What test, if any, was

administered after filling out the form does not bear on the 
clarity of the language used in the form. 
Therefore, the July 30, 2009 Judgment of the District 
Court of the Fifth Circuit, L lhu'e Division is affirmed.
