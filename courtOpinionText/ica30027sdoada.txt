LILLIAN P. HOLCOMB, PH.D., Respondent-Appellant/Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI» I, DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,
BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY, Petitioner-Appellee/Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 08-1-423)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.) 
Respondent-Appellant/Appellant Lillian P. Holcomb, 
Ph.D. (Holcomb), appeals from the order and judgment, which were 
entered on July 29, 2009 in the Circuit Court of the Third 
Circuit (Circuit Court),1 affirming the suspension of Holcomb's 
license to practice psychology by Petitioner-Appellee/Appellee 
State of Hawai» i, Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, 
Board of Psychology. Holcomb argues that the Circuit Court 
violated her due process right to a fundamentally fair hearing 
because it affirmed: (1) the hearings officer's denial of 
Holcomb's Motion to Compel Discovery and Produce Respondent's 
Treatment File; (2) the hearings officer's method of allowing 
unverified witness testimony; (3) the hearings officer's 
rejection of Holcomb's expert witness's testimony and the

crediting of the testimony of the State's expert witness; and (4)
 
the Board of Psychology's adoption of the hearings officer's
 
findings and conclusions.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, as well as the
 
relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Holcomb's points of
 
error as follows:
 
(1) The Circuit Court did not violate Holcomb's due
 
process right to a fundamentally fair hearing by affirming the
 
hearings officer's denial of Holcomb's Motion to Compel Discovery
 
and Produce Respondent's Treatment File, which sought to obtain
 
the complaining patient's full treatment record.
 
First, Holcomb relies on authorities that require the 
hearings officer to receive  evidence. See, e.g., Desmond v. 
Admin. Dir. of the Courts, State of Hawai» i, 91 Hawai» i 212, 220, 
982 P.2d 346, 354 (1998), overruled on other grounds, 90 Hawai» i 
301, 978 P.2d 739 (1998). But these authorities do not, on their face, stand for the proposition that the hearings officer is 
obligated to gather evidence on behalf of the respondent. 
Second, while the Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR)
 
give the hearings officer in a psychologist license hearing the
 
power to issue subpoenas and to rule on motions, see  HAR
 
§ 16-201-17, they do not provide for a right to discovery similar
 
to that available to a litigant in a civil suit. Although
 
represented by counsel throughout the administrative proceedings, 
Holcomb did not request that the hearings officer issue a
 
subpoena. Instead, Holcomb implicitly suggests that the motion
 
to compel was the functional equivalent to a request for a
 
subpoena but Holcomb provides no reasoning or authorities in
 
support of this suggestion. Accordingly, Holcomb failed to avail
 
herself of the procedures provided by the HAR for obtaining the
 
complaining patient's full treatment record and, thus, waived any
 
2
  
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
potential right to additional procedural protections related to
 
her quest to obtain those records. See Dragan v. Connecticut
 
Med. Examining Bd., 613 A.2d 739, 746 (Conn. 1992) (holding that
 
a doctor waived his right of cross-examination in a medical
 
licensing hearing because he did not request the board to
 
subpoena the witness or move the board to strike the testimony on
 
direct examination).
 
Similarly, given that she could have asked the hearings 
officer or the director to issue a subpoena, Holcomb's argument 
that the futility exception to the administrative exhaustion 
requirement applies is unpersuasive. See, e.g., In re Doe 
Children, 105 Hawai» i 38, 60-61, 93 P.3d 1145, 1167-68 (2004) 
(rejecting a guardian ad litem's contention that the "futility 
exception" to the exhaustion-of-administrative-remedies 
requirement applied where there was an administrative process 
that could have provided the minor with the sought remedy even 
though the guardian ad litem did not have standing to seek such 
relief). 
Furthermore, the statements of the hearings officer and
 
the Board of Psychology regarding their respective roles in
 
assessing the constitutionality of their own actions did not
 
suggest that they acted arbitrarily or capriciously but, instead,
 
merely noted that courts determine constitutional questions. See
 
generally HOH Corp. v. Motor Vehicle Indus. Licensing Bd., 69
 
Haw. 135, 142, 736 P.2d 1271, 1275 (1987).
 
(2) The Circuit Court did not violate Holcomb's due
 
process right to a fundamentally fair hearing by affirming the
 
hearings officer's method of allowing unverified witness
 
testimony.
 
Holcomb's sole case citation supporting her argument
 
that the hearings officer's method of allowing unverified witness
 
testimony violated her due process rights is to Greene v.
 
McElroy, 360 U.S. 474, 496-97 (1959). But the Greene decision
 
3
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
did not adopt a categorical rule regarding telephonic testimony
 
or engage in a robust discussion of whether the challenged
 
procedures under the particular circumstances comported with the
 
Constitution. Id. at 508.
 
Courts have noted that telephonic testimony makes it
 
difficult for the court to ascertain the identity of the witness
 
and to gauge the credibility of the witness because the witness's
 
demeanor cannot be observed by the judge. See, e.g. , Ainsworth
 
v. Astrue, Civ. No. 09-cv-286-SM, 2010 WL 2521432, at *4 (D.N.H. 
Jun. 17, 2010). Nonetheless, courts may permit telephonic 
testimony in civil proceedings, finding that this practice 
comports with due process requirements when the witness is sworn 
in, the adverse party has the opportunity to question the 
witness, and the witness lives out of state or otherwise is 
unable to physically attend the hearing. See, e.g., 
Barrera-Quintero v. Holder , 699 F.3d 1239, 1248 (10th Cir. 2012); 
In re MH-2008-000867, 236 P.3d 405, 409 (Ariz. 2010); 
Beltran Tirado v. I.N.S., 213 F.3d 1179, 1185 86 (9th Cir. 2000); 
see also In re G Children, 115 Hawai» i 147, 165 P.3d 1048, No. 
27866, 2007 WL 1147071, at *7-8 (App. Apr. 16, 2007) (mem.) 
(rejecting mother's assertion that her due process rights were 
violated when a family court, amongst other issues, permitted a 
social worker to testify by telephone at the trial). These three 
elements are present in this case. 
Moreover, Holcomb's suggested procedural protection -­
requiring the witnesses to sign in before a notary to verify
 
their identities -- was unlikely to have a significant benefit in
 
that there is nothing in the record that suggests there was any
 
true question as to the identity of the complaining patient. The
 
complaining patient also stated that he was alone when he
 
provided his telephonic testimony, which reduces the likelihood
 
that the procedure introduced a possibility of an erroneous
 
deprivation due to collusion or intimidation amongst the State's
 
4
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
witnesses. Furthermore, the hearings officer stated that his 
findings and conclusions were primarily based on Holcomb's own 
statements and actions. Accordingly, the hearings officer's 
admission of the telephonic testimony did not create a 
substantial risk of an erroneous deprivation of Holcomb's 
property interest in her professional license. See In re G 
Children, 2007 WL 1147071, at *7-8; Korean Buddhist Dae Won Sa Temple of Hawaii v. Sullivan, 87 Hawai» i 217, 241, 953 P.2d 1315, 
1339 (1998) ("Thus, if the Director's consultation of evidence outside the record did not affect the Temple's substantial 
rights, his decision must be affirmed despite the technical HAPA 
violation."). 
(3) Holcomb failed to establish that, as a matter of 
law, the hearing officer erred by rejecting Holcomb's expert 
witness's testimony and crediting of the testimony of the State's 
expert witness. Holcomb's argument primarily reduces to an 
invitation for an appellate court to re-weigh the evidence 
presented to the hearings officer. This is not proper, 
especially when an appellate court is reviewing the findings of 
an expert agency dealing with a specialized field. See In re 
Application of Hawaiian Electric Co., Inc., 81 Hawai» i 459, 465, 
918 P.2d 561, 567 (1996). 
Additionally, Holcomb's assertion that the Board of
 
Psychology erred by not conducting an inquiry into Holcomb's
 
practice lacks any citations to the record or authority and is
 
not obviously true given that the administrative hearing is an
 
inquiry into the nature of Holcomb's practice.
 
(4) Finally, Holcomb does not present any new
 
contentions, reasoning, or authorities to support her argument
 
that the Circuit Court violated her due process right to a
 
fundamentally fair hearing by affirming the Board of Psychology's
 
adoption of the hearings officer's findings. Thus, given the
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
reasoning above, Holcomb's fourth point of error fails to present
 
any reversible error.
 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Circuit Court of the
 
Third Circuit's July 29, 2009 order and judgment affirming the
 
suspension of Holcomb's license to practice psychology is
 
affirmed.
