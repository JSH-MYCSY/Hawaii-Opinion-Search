APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P. NO. 08-1-0029 (CR NO. 92-2001))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Leonard, Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Saofaiga Loa (Loa) appeals from
 
the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying
 
Petition for Post-Conviction Relief (Order Denying Petition),
 which was filed on August 13, 2009, in the Circuit Court of the
 First Circuit (circuit court).
1 We affirm.
 
I.
 
The facts regarding Loa's underlying criminal case were
 
described by the Hawai 'i Supreme Court as follows: 
In the early morning hours of July 3, 1992, Loa and
two of his male companions attacked a couple--the
complainant and her male companion, a legally blind person-­in the park on Magic Island, which is located in the City
and County of Honolulu. During the course of the attack,
the complainant was repeatedly sexually assaulted (including
[numerous and different acts of sexual penetration]--all by
"strong compulsion"), stabbed in the back with a knife, and
left naked and bleeding on the beach. Her automobile was
 stolen. Her male companion was also stabbed repeatedly and
left to die. During their ordeal, the complainant and her
male companion were continually taunted by their attackers
about their ethnicity and imminent deaths. Remarkably, both
victims survived.
 
State v. Loa, 83 Hawai 'i 335, 339, 926 P.2d 1258, 1262 (1996).

After a jury trial,  Loa was found guilty of one count
of attempted manslaughter, one count of first degree robbery, six

counts of first degree sexual assault, and one count of
 
kidnapping. Respondent-Appellee State of Hawaii (State) moved
 for extended terms of imprisonment pursuant to Hawaii Revised
 Statutes (HRS) §§ 706-661 and 706-662(4) and (5) (1993) and
 further moved that the terms of imprisonment imposed on Loa be
 served consecutively. The circuit court granted the State's
 motions for extended term sentencing, based on Loa's status as
 multiple offender under HRS § 706-662(4), and for consecutive
 sentencing. The circuit court sentenced Loa to seven extended
 terms of life imprisonment with the possibility of parole for his
 class A felonies (first degree sexual assault and first degree
 robbery) and two extended terms of twenty years of imprisonment
 for his class B felonies (attempted manslaughter and kidnapping),
 all terms to run consecutively. 
Loa filed a direct appeal from his convictions and 
sentences. On November 6, 1996, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court issued 
a published opinion that vacated Loa's conviction and sentence for attempted reckless manslaughter, which the supreme court held was a non-existent offense, and affirmed the circuit court's judgment and sentence in all other respects. Loa, 83 Hawai
'i at 
361, 926 P.2d 1284. There is no indication that Loa petitioned for writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court. 
II.
 
On July 25, 2008, Loa filed a "Petition to Vacate, Set
 
Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner from Custody" 
(Petition), pursuant to Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP)
 Rule 40 (2006). On August 13, 2009, the circuit court denied the
 claims raised by Loa in his Petition and issued its Order Denying
 Petition.
 
The gist of Loa's arguments on appeal, as it was in the
 
circuit court, is that: 1) Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466
 (2000), and its progeny apply retroactively to Loa's case to
 invalidate his extended terms of imprisonment; 2) based on State
 v. Maugaotega, 115 Hawai
'i 432, 168 P.3d 562 (2007) (Maugaotega 
II), the version of the extended term statute under which Loa was 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
sentenced, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 706-662 (1993), was
 
void ab initio, and thus his extended term sentences must be
 vacated and ordinary term sentences imposed; and 3) based on
 Apprendi and its progeny, the circuit court's imposition of
 consecutive sentences was unconstitutional because it was not
 based on facts found by a jury. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, we hold as follows:
 
1. Apprendi and its progeny do not apply retroactively 
to Loa's collateral attack on his extended term sentences because his convictions and sentences became final before Apprendi was decided. See State v. Gomes, 107 Hawai
'i 308, 312-14, 113 P.3d 
184, 188-90 (2005); Loher v. State, 118 Hawai 'i 522, 534-38, 193 
P.3d 438, 450-54 (App. 2008); United States v. Cruz, 423 F.3d 1119, 1120-21 (9th Cir. 2005). Maugaotega II, which was based on 
Cunningham v. California, 549 U.S. 270 (2007), a progeny of Apprendi, likewise does not apply retroactively to Loa's collateral attack of his extended term sentences. See Gomes, 107 
Hawai
'i at 312-14, 113 P.3d at 188-90; Loher, 118 Hawai 'i at 534­
38, 193 P.3d at 450-54; Cruz, 423 F.3d at 1120-21. 
2. The version of HRS § 706-662 under which Loa was 
sentenced was not void ab initio. See State v. Jess, 117 Hawai 'i 
381, 388-89, 406-15, 184 P.3d 133, 140-41, 158-67 (2008); State v. Cutsinger, 118 Hawai
'i 68, 79-82, 185 P.3d 816, 827-830 (App. 
2008), overruled in part on other grounds by Jess, 117 Hawai 'i at 
398 n.17, 184 P.3d at 150 n.17; Loher, 118 Hawai 'i at 534-38, 193 
P.3d at 450-54. Loa's convictions and extended term sentences became final before the United States Supreme Court announced its new constitutional rule of criminal procedure in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), and thus Loa's extended term sentences were constitutional and legal when imposed. See Gomes, 
107 Hawai
'i at 314, 113 P.3d at 190. 
In Jess, the Hawai 'i Supreme Court held that the trial 
court had the authority to resentence Jess to extended terms of imprisonment pursuant to the former version of the extended term 
3

sentencing statute, HRS § 706-662 (Supp. 1996), which was in 
effect in 2000 when Jess committed the charged offenses, by invoking its inherent judicial power to empanel a jury to make the "necessity" finding. Jess, 117 Hawai
'i at 388-89, 410-13, 
184 P.3d at 140-41, 162-65; see also State v. Mark, No. 26784, slip op. at 97-101, 2010 WL 1888944, at *45-47 (Hawai
'i May 12, 
2010). The supreme court could not have reached this conclusion in Jess if the former versions of HRS § 706-662 were void ab initio. 
Loa's reliance upon Riley v. Kennedy, 553 U.S. 406, 128
 
S. Ct. 1970 (2008), is misplaced. The context in which the Court
 in Riley determined that an Alabama election law was properly
 regarded as void ab initio was far different from Loa's 
situation. Riley is inapposite and does not support Loa's 
arguments. 
3. Apprendi and its progeny do not prohibit the 
sentencing court from making factual findings necessary to impose consecutive sentences. See State v. Kahapea, 111 Hawai
'i 267, 
278-80, 141 P.3d 440, 451-53 (2006) (dismissing the proposition that Apprendi or Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004), proscribes consecutive term sentencing by a trial judge); Oregon v. Ice, --- U.S. ---, ---, 129 S. Ct. 711, 714-15 (2009) (confirming the constitutionality of the practice of allowing sentencing courts to determine the facts necessary to impose consecutive sentences); see also State v. Hussein, --- Hawai
'i 
—--, ---, 229 P.3d 313 (2010) (upholding trial judge's imposition of consecutive sentences). Accordingly, the circuit court's determination that Loa's sentences should be served consecutively and its imposition of consecutive sentences did not violate the constitution.

3 We are not persuaded by Loa's contention that a 2003
unpublished memorandum opinion by the Hawai 'i Supreme Court in
State v. Sua, No. 24501 (Hawai 'i December 30, 2003), supports his
claim that Apprendi should be applied retroactively to his

collateral attack of his sentences. Sua was not sentenced to an extended term of imprisonment, and the supreme court affirmed thetrial court's imposition of consecutive sentences. The supremecourt did not hold that 
Apprendi applied retroactively to Sua's
collateral attack of his sentences, but merely cited Apprendi insupport of its conclusion that Sua possessed a colorable claimwith respect to the validity of his mandatory minimum term ofimprisonment that entitled him to a hearing. Under Hawai
'i Rules 
of Appellate Procedure Rule 35(c)(1) (2008), Loa cannot cite theunpublished decision in Sua as precedent or for persuasive value.Moreover, the supreme court subsequently issued a publishedopinion in Gomes holding that Apprendi does not applyretroactively to cases on collateral attack.
