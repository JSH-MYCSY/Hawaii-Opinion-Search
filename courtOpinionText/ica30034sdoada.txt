OF THE STATE OF HAWAI rI 
STATE OF HAWAI rI, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
SONNY KELEMETE, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

 
(CR. NO. 08-1-0795)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER

 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Sonny Kelemete (Kelemete) appeals
from the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence entered on
 
August 17, 2009 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 
(circuit court).1
  
Kelemete was convicted of Promoting a Dangerous Drug in
 
the Third Degree, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 
ยง 712-1243 (Supp. 2009). He also pleaded guilty to one count of 
Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII)
 
in violation of HRS ยง 261E-61 (Supp. 2009) and one count of
 
Driving Without a License (DWOL) in violation of HRS ยง 286-102
 
(2007 Repl.). On January 7, 2009, the jury returned a guilty
 
verdict on the drug charge, for which the circuit court sentenced
 
Kelemete to five years imprisonment with a reduced mandatory
 
minimum of ten months as a repeat offender. Kelemete received
 
concurrent thirty-day and five-day sentences for the OVUII and
 
DWOL convictions, respectively.

Kelemete raises two points on appeal. First, he
 
contends that the circuit court erred by denying his motion for
 
judgment of acquittal.2 Second, Kelemete argues that the jury's
 
verdict lacked sufficient evidentiary support.
 
After careful review of the issues raised, arguments
 
advanced, applicable law, and record in the instant case, we
 resolve Kelemete's points of error as follows:
 
(1) Kelemete waived his right to appeal the circuit 
court's denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal when he 
presented evidence following the circuit court's ruling. "It is 
well settled that when the defense presents evidence after a 
motion for judgment of acquittal made at the close of the 
prosecution's case, any error by the trial court in the denial of 
the motion is waived by the defense." State v. Pudiquet, 82 
Hawai
ri 419, 423, 922 P.2d 1032, 1036 (App. 1996). 
(2) As the evidence adduced in the trial court must be 
considered in the strongest light for the prosecution, there was substantial evidence to support Kelemete's conviction for 
Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the Third Degree. State v. Richie, 
88 Hawai
ri 19, 33, 960 P.2d 1227, 1241 (1998) (stating that the 
proper standard of review on appeal for claims of insufficient 
evidence is whether there existed substantial evidence to support 
the conclusion of the trier of fact). Kelemete's argument on 
this point asks this court to consider the credibility of witness 
testimony, a consideration inappropriate for an appellate court. 
See State v. Bogdanoff, 59 Haw. 603, 608, 585 P.2d 602, 606 
(1978). It is well settled that "the jury is the sole judge of 
the credibility of witnesses." Id. In this case, the jury was 
presented with conflicting witness testimony, considered the testimony and deduced from it its verdict. This court will not

 Kelemete moved for a judgment of acquittal after the
State rested.  The circuit court denied his motion, and Kelemete
subsequently presented evidence. He did not renew his motion at
 
the close of his case.

interfere with such determinations. See Bogdanoff, 59 Haw. at
 
608, 585 P.2d at 606. 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the August 17, 2009 Judgment

 
of Circuit Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
