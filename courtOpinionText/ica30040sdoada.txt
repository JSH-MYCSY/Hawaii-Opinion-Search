STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
RICHARD K. LOVELL, SR., Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
NORTH AND SOUTH HILO DIVISION
 
(CITATION NO. 3DTI-09-023832)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Richard K. Lovell, Sr. (Lovell)
 
appeals from the Judgment After Trial De Novo & Notice of Entry
 
of Judgment entered on August 27, 2009 in the District Court of
 the Third Circuit, North and South Hilo Division (district
 court).
1
 
On August 4, 2009, the district court found that Lovell
 
was guilty of violating Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 291-11.6(a)(1),
 Mandatory Use of Seat Belts.
 
On appeal, Lovell claims, "I am unable to find any
 
information that informs me that the constitution and laws of
 'State of Hawaii' have force and or effect in the Hawaiian
 Kingdom and are enforceable for and/or against me while I'm in
 the Hawaiian Kingdom." We understand Lovell to be contesting the
 jurisdiction of the district court.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Lovell's point of error as follows:
 
Lovell's claim that the district court lacked 
jurisdiction over him because he is presently, and was at the time of his citation, in the Kingdom of Hawai
'i is without merit. 
State v. Lee, 90 Hawai 'i 130, 142, 976 P.2d 444, 456 (1999) ("it 
is clear that the various constitutions of the kingdom do not

bind the current government of the state of Hawai 'i"). Hawai 'i's 
motor vehicle laws apply to anyone operating a motor vehicle on 
the public roadways. State v. Fergerstrom, 106 Hawai 'i 43, 55, 
101 P.3d 652, 664 (App. 2004). 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the August 27, 2009 Judgment
 
After Trial De Novo & Notice of Entry of Judgment is affirmed.
