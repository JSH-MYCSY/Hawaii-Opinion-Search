I. BACKGROUND
 
A. Overview of Factual Background
 
This action stems from a contract dispute between WDC
 
and Defendant-Appellee WHLI over WHLI's obligation to extend and
 
2
improve Paniolo Avenue , a roadway planned to run through a
portion of WHLI's property and adjacent to the County of 
Hawaifi's (County) affordable housing project in Waikoloa, 
Hawaifi. This obligation stemmed from an affirmative covenant 
contained in the deed by which WHLI took title to the property. 
On March 2, 1988, the County and Transcontinental
 
Development Co. (TDC) entered into an agreement whereby TDC would
 
deed 300 acres of land to the County to help meet the affordable
 
housing requirements applicable to the Waikoloa Beach Resort. 
The Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) required, in pertinent part:
 
MINIMUM IMPROVEMENTS AND REQUIREMENTS
 
TDC agrees to provide, or shall cause to be provided, if and
when required, the following:
 . . . .
 
3. Roads. Paniolo Drive shall be extended and improved to
County dedicable standards with four lanes as well as
intersections providing two ingress and egress points to the
property. TDC shall insure, to the extent not built by
other developers, that the improvements to Paniolo Drive are
provided within five years from the date of this agreement.
 
WDC subsequently assumed TDC's rights and obligations
 
under the March 2, 1988 MOA with the County's approval.
 
On July 30, 1990, WDC conveyed the 866 acre Waikoloa
 
Heights Property to Waikoloa Heights Associates (WHA) as grantee
 
(1990 Deed). WHA conveyed that property on the same day to an
 
entity named Waikoloa Heights Investment Partners, L.P., subject
 
to all of the terms, conditions, and covenants contained in the
 
1990 Deed. The 1990 Deed expressly created an affirmative
 
covenant between WDC and the owner of the Waikoloa Heights
 
2
 Paniolo Avenue was formerly known as Paniolo Drive.
 
2
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Property, binding all subsequent owners of the property with the
 
obligation to extend Paniolo Avenue when required under the
 
County Housing Agreement.3
 
On May 9, 2006, WDC sent a letter to WHLI demanding
 
that WHLI extend Paniolo Avenue pursuant to the MOA and the 1990
 
Deed.4 A subsequent letter reiterating that demand was sent on
 
July 28, 2006. On August 25, 2006, WHLI "responded that the duty
 in the MOA and the 1990 Deed to build the road extension by March
 
2, 1993 no longer was enforceable."
 
B. Procedural Posture
 
On September 12, 2006, WDC filed a Complaint against
 
WHLI, asserting claims of "(1) breach of the 1990 Deed; (2)
 
declaratory relief; (3) unjust enrichment/equitable lien; and (4)
 
specific performance ordering WHLI to immediately and timely take
 
all necessary action to extend and improve Paniolo Avenue."
 
On October 26, 2006, WDC filed its MPSJ seeking an
 
order that "WHLI is obligated at its sole expense to immediately
 
and timely take all necessary action to extend and improve
 
Paniolo Avenue[.]"
 
On September 24, 2008, WHLI filed its MSJ seeking to
 
dismiss all claims in the complaint.
 
On November 17, 2008, the circuit court heard arguments
 
on both motions for summary judgment. 
3
 The 1990 Deed states, in pertinent part:
 
3. Roadway. Grantee shall, at its expense, extend and
improve Paniolo [Avenue] from the intersection of Paniolo [Avenue] and
Hofoko Street up through the northern boundary line of Lot 2 of File
Plan 1967 to County dedicable standards with four lanes as well asintersections providing two ingress and egress points to Lot 2 of FilePlan 1967 pursuant to that certain [MOA], executed by the County ofHawaii and Transcontinental Development Co. ("County HousingAgreement"). Grantee agrees that it will complete such extension ofPaniolo [Avenue] at such time as may be required under the CountyHousing Agreement but in any case prior to March 2, 1993. 
4
 WHLI took title to the property by deed recorded with the Bureau
of Conveyances on May 23, 2009. The WHLI deed was subject to the covenants
and conditions of the 1990 Deed.

   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
On December 5, 2008, the circuit court issued an "Order
 
Granting [WHLI's] [MSJ], Filed September 24, 2008." The order 1)
 
granted WHLI's MSJ dismissing Counts I, II, and IV of the
 
Complaint with prejudice; and 2) denied WDC's MPSJ. The circuit
 
court found, in pertinent part: 
1. That the obligation to construct the extension
to the roadway known alternatively as Paniolo Drive and
Paniolo Avenue ("Paniolo Avenue") contained within that
certain Deed dated July 30, 1990 . . . is an affirmative
covenant providing for the construction of the extension to
Paniolo Avenue within a specified period of time;
 
2. That the affirmative covenant contained in the
 
1990 Deed providing for the construction of the extension to
Paniolo Avenue is contractual in nature;
 
3. That there is no ambiguity in the 1990 Deed
regarding the obligation to construct the extension to
Paniolo Avenue;
 
4. That the extension to Paniolo Avenue was not
 
constructed within the time specified in the 1990 Deed; and
 
5. That no action was taken to enforce the
 
obligation in the 1990 Deed to construct the extension to
Paniolo Avenue within the statute of limitations under Haw.
 Rev. Stat. § 657-1(1).
5
 
On December 5, 2008, WHLI filed MFC. On April 15,
 
2009, the circuit court issued an "Order to Revise and Clarify
 
Billing Submitted For [WHLI's] [MFC] Filed December 5, 2008,"
 
ordering WHLI to revise and clarify the billings used to support
 
its request for attorneys' fees and costs.
 
On August 5, 2009, the circuit court entered the "Order
 
Granting in Part and Denying in Part [WHLI's] [MFC]. WHLI was
 
awarded attorneys' fees in the amount of $219,608.48 and costs in
 
the amount of $12,419.25.
 
On August 24, 2009, the circuit court entered its
 
"Final Judgment Entered Against WDC," that 1) dismissed with
 
prejudice Counts I, II, and IV of WDC's Complaint; 2) dismissed
 
5
 Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 657-1(1) (1993) enumerates a statute
of limitation of six years "after the cause of action accrued" for "[a]ctions
for the recovery of any debt founded upon any contract, obligation, or
liability[.]"

    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
without prejudice Count III of WDC's Complaint; and 3) awarded
 
WHLI a total judgment of $232,027.73.
 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
Summary Judgment
 
The standard of review for the grant or denial of a
motion for summary judgment is well-settled. "Unlike other
 
appellate matters, in reviewing summary judgment decisions
an appellate court steps into the shoes of the trial court
and applies the same legal standard as the trial court
applied." Beamer v. Nishiki, 66 Haw. 572, 577, 670 P.2d
1264, 1270 (1983). "[The appellate] court reviews a circuit
court's grant or denial of summary judgment de novo."
Bremer v. Weeks, 104 Hawaif i 43, 51, 85 P.3d 150, 158 (2004)
(quoting Hawaif i Cmty. Fed. Credit Union v. Keka, 94 Hawaif i 
213, 221, 11 P.3d 1, 9 (2000)).
 
[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and
admissions on file, together, with the affidavits, if
any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any
material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law. A fact is material if
 proof of that fact would have the effect of
establishing or refuting one of the essential elements
of a cause of action or defense asserted by the
parties. The evidence must be viewed in the light
most favorable to the non-moving party. In other
 words, we must view all of the evidence and the
inferences drawn therefrom, in the light most
favorable to the party opposing the motion.
 
Omerod v. Heirs of Kaheananui, 116 Hawaif i 239, 254-255, 172
P.3d 983, 998-999 (2007) (citations omitted). 
Blaisdell v. Dep't of Public Safety, 119 Hawai fi 275, 282, 196 
P.3d 277, 284 (2008).
 
Attorneys' Fees
 
[The appellate] court reviews the denial and granting
of attorney's fees under the abuse of discretion standard.
The same standard applies to [the appellate] court's review
of the amount of a trial court's award of attorney's fees.
An abuse of discretion occurs if the trial court has clearly
exceeded the bounds of reason or has disregarded rules or
principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment
of a party litigant.
 
Chun v. Bd. of Trs. of Employees' Ret. Sys. of State of Hawai fi, 
106 Hawai fi 416, 431, 106 P.3d 339, 354 (2005) (internal 
quotation marks, citations, brackets in original, and ellipses 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
omitted) (quoting Chun v. Bd. of Trs. of Employees' Ret. Sys. of 
State of Hawai fi, 92 Hawai fi 432, 439, 992 P.2d 127, 134 (2000)). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
A.	 Whether the circuit court erred in denying WDC's MPSJ.
 
WDC argues that the circuit court erred in denying its
 
MPSJ because 1) the plain language of the affirmative covenant
 
and overwhelming majority of cases provide that performance is
 
due upon demand; 2) extension of Paniolo Avenue could not occur
 
until it was required by the County; and 3) the circuit court's
 
reliance on Rivemont Farms LLC v. Northeast Solite Corp., 848
 
N.Y.S.2d 416 (NY 2007) was misplaced. 
1.	 Whether there is plain language and factual basis
to support WDC's position that performance was due
on demand.
 
WDC argues that "the overwhelming and undisputed intent
 
of the County" was that the Paniolo Avenue extension was to be
 
built when required for the County's affordable housing project. 
In support, WDC points out the futility of building the road at
 
the time stated in the MOA and deed, because the properties it
 
was to serve were "nothing more than fields of dirt and lava
 
rock."
 
a.	 The plain language of the Covenant and MOA.
 
It was WDC's position that "WHLI's obligation to
 
perform under the deed covenant is expressly conditioned upon
 
Paniolo Avenue being required by the County[.]" WDC relies on
 
the "if and when required" language of the covenant in support.
 
WDC argues that WHLI's obligation to extend and improve Paniolo
 
Avenue did not begin to run until the County demanded
 
construction in April 2006. WDC argues that its right of action
 
against WHLI only accrued after WHLI refused to perform its
 
obligation in 2006.
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
WHLI, on the other hand, points out that WDC's argument
 
"ignores [the] salient second half" of the 1990 Deed provision,
 
which states in full that "[g]rantee agrees that it will complete
 
such extension of Paniolo [Avenue] at such time as may be
 
required under the County Housing Agreement but in any case prior
 
to March 2, 1993." In addition, the MOA required "that the
 
improvements to Paniolo [Avenue] are provided within five years
 
from the date of this agreement," which WHLI points out was also
 
March 2, 1993. WHLI notes that in the MOA, none of the other
 
capital improvements had deadlines imposed upon them besides the
 
section referencing the Paniolo Avenue extension.
 
WHLI contends the "language [of the MOA and 1990 Deed 
are] clear on its face, incapable of any other interpretation." 
A contract "should be construed as a whole and its meaning 
determined from the entire context and not from any particular 
word, phrase, or clause." Hawaii Med. Ass'n v. Hawaii Med. Serv. 
Ass'n, Inc., 113 Hawai fi 77, 92, 148 P.3d 1179, 1194 (2006). 
It is well-settled that "[a] term of a contract is
 
ambiguous when it is capable of being reasonably understood in
 more ways than one." Stewart v. Brennan, 7 Haw. App. 136, 142­
143, 748 P.2d 816, 821 (1988). Furthermore, "an agreement should
 be construed as a whole and its meaning determined from the
 
entire context and not from any particular word, phrase, or
 
clause." Maui Land & Pineapple, Co., Inc. v. Dillingham Corp.,
 
67 Haw. 4, 11, 674 P.2d 390, 395 (1984). Despite the fact that
 there was no need for the road at the time of the March 2, 1993
 
deadline, the language of the MOA and 1990 Deed are clear in
 
firmly setting that date.
 
WDC argues the extrinsic evidence of the parties' 
intent when making the agreement should be considered. WDC 
points to the Hawai
fi Supreme Court's holding that "[a]ll 
evidence outside of the writing including parol evidence, [should] be considered by the court to determine the true intent 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of the parties if there is any doubt or controversy as to the
 
meaning of the language embodying their bargain." Hokama v.
 
Relinc Corp., 57 Haw. 470, 476, 559 P.2d 279, 283 (1977). 
However, here the language of the MOA and 1990 Deed are not
 
ambiguous or unclear in their meaning.
 
"Where a writing is found to be clear and unambiguous 
and 'represents the final and complete agreement of the parties,' 
the parol evidence rule bars evidence of 'prior contemporaneous 
negotiations and agreements that vary or alter the terms of a 
written instrument.'" United Public Workers, AFSCME, Local 646, 
AFL-CIO v. Dawson Int'l, Inc., 113 Hawai
fi 127, 140-141, 149 P.3d 
495, 508-509 (2006). "The court should look no further than the 
four corners of the document to determine whether an ambiguity 
exists." United Public Workers, 113 Hawai fi at 140, 149 P.3d at 
508.
 
2.	 Whether the extension could not occur until
 
required by the County.
 
The point of WDC's argument is that the extension of
 
Paniolo Avenue could not possibly occur until required by the
 
County, and thus the statute of limitations could not begin to
 
run until that time. WDC argues that the covenant could not have
 
been breached until after the County approved the Amendment to
 
Planned Unit Development Permit No. 73 for the Waikoloa Heights
 
Property on April 10, 2006, requiring the owners to "construct,
 
at a minimum, two lanes of the 'Paniolo Avenue Extension.'" For
 
support, WDC asserts that "[a] condition precedent to an
 
obligation to perform a contract calls for the performance of
 
some act or the happening of some event after a contract is
 
entered into, upon the performance or happening of which the
 
obligation to perform immediately is made to depend." Handley v.
 
Ching, 2 Haw. App. 166, 169, 627 P.2d 1132, 1135 (1981). 
However, WDC's discussion of conditions precedent and
 
contingencies are contrary to the language of the 1990 Deed,
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
which plainly states the extension was to be completed "in any
 
case prior to March 2, 1993."
 
3.	 Whether the circuit court's reliance on Rivemont
 
Farms was misplaced.
 
a.	 Rivemont Farms
 
The circuit court relied on the New York Supreme Court
 
Appellate Division's decision in Rivemont Farms for the
 
propositions that 1) affirmative covenants contained in a deed
 
could be rendered unenforceable due to the expiration of the
 
statute of limitations; and 2) that the statute of limitations
 
does not begin to run only when a demand for compliance was
 
rejected. Rivemont Farms, 848 N.Y.S.2d 416. In Rivemont Farms,
 
covenants contained in deeds required the purchaser, the
 predecessor in interest to the plaintiff, to plant trees and
 
construct a berm within twelve months after closing. These
 
covenants were held unenforceable due to the expiration of a six-
year statute of limitations, and the argument that the statute of
 
limitations could only be commenced by defendant's demand for
 
compliance was rejected. Id. 
There was a fixed deadline set in the covenant
 
agreement in this case as in Rivemont Farms. The circuit court's
 
reliance on Rivemont Farms was not misplaced.
 
b.	 Scherpenseel v. Bitney
 
WDC compares the instant case to that of Scherpenseel
 
v. Bitney, 865 P.2d 1145 (Mont. 1993), in which the Montana
 
Supreme Court found that the plaintiffs suit to enforce a
 
covenant to build a road filed sixteen years after purchase of
 
the property was not barred by the statute of limitations because
 
only one year had passed since the defendants refused plaintiffs'
 
demand to perform the covenant and build the road. However, the
 
deed covenant in Scherpenseel did not contain an express deadline
 
9
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
for performance, containing instead an open-ended obligation for
 
performance "in the future" to improve and donate a County Road. 
The language of the 1990 Deed and MOA are clear. The
 
operative deadline was March 2, 1993. The circuit court's ruling
 
granting summary judgment to WHLI was not in error. 
B.	 Whether the circuit court erred in granting in part WHLI's
MFC.
 
WDC argues that because the case was not in the nature
 
of assumpsit, WHLI is not entitled to fees under HRS § 607-14. 
WDC also argues that WHLI failed to meet its burden for an award
 
of attorneys' fees with sufficient documentation.
 
1.	 Whether the case was in the nature of assumpsit.
 
The Hawai fi Supreme Court "has defined assumpsit as a 
common law form of action which allows for the recovery of
 
damages for the non-performance of a contract[.]" S. Utsunomiya
 
Enterprises, Inc. v. Moomuku Country Club, 76 Hawai fi 396, 399­
400, 879 P.2d 501, 504-505 (1994) (quotation marks omitted).
 
The Hawai fi Supreme Court has held that: 
[a]s a general proposition, the character of an action is
determined from the facts stated in, and the issues raised
by, the plaintiff's complaint, declaration, or petition. It
is determined from the substance of the entire pleading, the
nature of the grievance, and the relief sought, rather than
from the formal language employed or the form of the
pleadings.
 
Schulz v. Honsador, Inc., 67 Haw. 433, 436, 690 P.2d 279, 282
 
(1984), overruled on other grounds, (quoting 63 Am.Jur.2d
 
Products Liability § 906 (1984)). Further, an "action for breach
 
of warranty clearly is in the nature of assumpsit, inasmuch as a
 
warranty arises from the contractual relationship between buyer
 
and seller, and a breach of warranty constitutes a breach of
 
contract." S. Utsunomiya Enterprises at 400, 879 P.2d at 505. 
WDC argues that actions for declaratory relief and 
specific performance are not in the nature of assumpsit. See 
Chock v. Gov't Emp. Ins. Co., 103 Hawai fi 263, 268, 81 P.3d 1178, 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
1183 (2003) (an action seeking a declaration as to the party's
 
rights and responsibilities, even if factually implicating a
 
contract, is not in the nature of assumpsit). However in
 
addition to asking for declaratory relief and specific
 
performance, WHLI prayed for "compensatory, consequential, and
 
incidental damages[.]"
 
WDC cites to Lee v. Aiu, 85 Hawai fi 19, 936 P.2d 655 
(1997) for the proposition that "a suit to enforce an agreement 
is a suit for specific performance and is not an action in the 
matter of assumpsit[]" even where the plaintiff asserts a claim 
for breach of contract and damages as alternative relief." Id. 
at 85 Hawai fi at 31-32, 936 P.2d at 667-668. WDC argues that its 
"claims for breach of deed and unjust enrichment/equitable lien 
were a means of alternative relief, in the event that during the 
pendancy of the litigation, the County required WDC to construct 
the extension of Paniolo Avenue based on WHLI's refusal to do 
so." However, in Lee, the Hawai fi Supreme Court found that 
because there were "no monetary damages . . . the appropriate remedy is specific enforcement of the agreement." In the instant 
case, monetary damages were prayed for in the Complaint. Lee did 
not involve claims for monetary damages. In seeking to enforce the 1990 Deed, WDC's Complaint included a prayer for its own 
attorneys' fees and costs. "[P]laintiff's prayer for attorneys' 
fees has been cited as a significant indication that the action 
sounded in assumpsit." Healy-Tibbitts Const. Co. v. Hawaiian 
Indep. Refinery, Inc., 673 F.2d 284, 286 (9th Cir. 1982) (internal quotations omitted). The instant action was in the 
nature of assumpsit. 
2.	 Whether WHLI met its burden for an award of
 
attorneys' fees by providing sufficient
information as required by HRS § 607-14.
 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
WHLI had the burden to "show the reasonableness of the
 
fee asked for and received." Sharp v. Hui Wahine, Inc., 49 Haw.
 
241, 246, 413 P.2d 242, 247 (1966).
 
WDC argues that "even assuming arguendo that the case
 
was in the nature of assumpsit, the fee request submitted by WHLI
 
was completely devoid of the information and evidence required to
 
support an award of fees under applicable case law." WDC's
 
argument is based upon the circuit court's determination that
 
WHLI's request for attorneys' fees included "fees for work done
 
that was not associated with the current litigation[,]" and was
 
presented in a such a way "that made it difficult for the Court
 
to apportion the fees between the assumpsit and non-assumpsit
 
claims."
 
HRS § 607-14 permits a prevailing party in actions in 
the nature of assumpsit to recover all attorneys' fees reasonably 
incurred, "provided that this amount shall not exceed [25%] of 
the judgment." The specific amount of fees awarded is capped at 
25%, but "the statute does not expressly instruct the courts as 
to how to calculate an award of attorney's fees when no precise 
monetary amount is sought in the pleadings[,]" and therefore is 
left to the trial court's discretion. Piedvache v. Knabusch, 88 
Hawaifi 115, 118, 962 P.2d 374, 377 (1998). "The trial judge is, 
more or less, knowledgeable as to what is reasonable as an 
attorney's fee." Sharp, 49 Haw. at 250, 413 P.2d at 248. 
No specific amount of monetary relief was prayed for in 
this case. However, "both parties have represented that the cost 
of completing the extension of Paniolo Avenue would range 
anywhere from a low of approximately $4 million to over $6 
million." Working off of the most conservative estimate, the 25% 
cap on awarded fees would be $1 million. WHLI's submitted fees, 
including Hawai fi General Excise Tax were $508,043.50. The 
circuit court reduced the fees award to $219,608.48 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The circuit court is allowed considerable discretion in
 
awarding attorneys' fees. See Sharp, 49 Haw. at 250, 413 P.2d at
 
249. There is nothing in the record to indicate the circuit
 
court abused this discretion.
