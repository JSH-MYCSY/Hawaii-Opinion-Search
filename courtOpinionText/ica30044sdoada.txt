v.
 
DANIEL JOSEPH JOHNSON, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NOS. 94-189K & 01-1-0004K)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
In this consolidated criminal appeal, Defendant-
Appellant Daniel Joseph Johnson (Johnson) appeals from two
 
separate orders of the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit.1 In
 
the first order, dated August 14, 2009, the circuit court revoked
 Johnson's probation in Criminal No. (Cr. No.) 94-189K and re­
sentenced him to prison for a term of five years based on his
 
conviction for promoting a dangerous drug in the third degree in
 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 712-1243 (1993). In
 
the second order, also dated August 14, 2009, the circuit court
 
revoked Johnson's probation in Cr. No. 01-1-0004k and re­
sentenced him to prison for a term of five years based on his
 
conviction for custodial interference in the first degree in

   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
violation of HRS § 707-726 (Supp. 2010). The circuit court
 
further ordered that the five year prison sentence for the
 
custodial interference conviction in Cr. No. 01-1-0004K run
 
consecutive to the five year prison sentence imposed in
 
Cr. No. 94-189K.
 
On appeal, Johnson raises one point of error, asserting 
that the circuit court committed plain error when it revoked his 
probation and re-sentenced him to five years of imprisonment in 
Cr. No. 94-189K, where the record in that case contains a May 16, 
2000 Order of Discharge and Dismissal that purportedly terminated 
the prosecution against Johnson. The State of Hawai' i (State) 
2
counters, inter alia,  that this court lacks jurisdiction to
decide whether the May 16, 2000 order is a basis for invalidating
 the August 14, 2009 revocation of probation in Cr. No. 94-189K
 
because Johnson did not raise this issue during earlier probation
 
revocation proceedings.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced, the issues raised by the parties, and the
 
relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Johnson's point of
 
error as follows:
 
(1)
 With regard to the threshold jurisdictional
 
question, the State argues that this court lacks jurisdiction to
 
decide whether the circuit court's May 16, 2000 order of
 
discharge and dismissal is a basis for invalidating the

 In addressing the merits of the appeal, the State's Answering Brief
at page 10 cites a case that the State itself describes as "unpublished" and
"non citable." The State also attaches a copy of the case to its AnsweringBrief. The State's citation to this case violates Rule 35(c)(1) of theHawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) because: the cited case was
decided prior to July 1, 2008; it does not establish the law of this case; itdoes not have res judicata or collateral estoppel effect in this case; and itdoes not involve "the same respondent". HRAP Rule 35(c)(1). The State should not have cited the case, this Court did not consider the cited case, and theState is cautioned that future violations of HRAP Rule 35(c)(1) may result insanctions.

August 14, 2009 revocation of probation in Cr. No. 94-189k
 
because Johnson did not raise this issue during earlier probation
 
revocation proceedings in 2001 and 2006. We disagree.
 
In criminal cases, appeals from the circuit court are
 
governed by HRS § 641-11 (Supp. 2010), which provides in
 
pertinent part:
 
§641-11 From circuit court.  Any party aggrieved by
the judgment of a circuit court in a criminal matter may
appeal to the intermediate appellate court, subject to
chapter 602, in the manner and within the time provided by
the rules of court. The sentence of the court in a criminal
 case shall be the judgment. 
Moreover, "[a] post-judgment order is appealable in its own right 
only if it meets the test of finality applicable to all judicial 
decisions." State v. Johnson, 96 Hawai' i 462, 469, 32 P.3d 106, 
113 (App. 2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). For purposes of the instant appeal, the circuit court's 
August 14, 2009 order of revocation of probation in Cr. No. 94­
189k ended that post-judgment probation revocation proceeding and 
aggrieved Johnson by re-sentencing him to imprisonment for a term 
of five years. Thus, the circuit court's August 14, 2009 order 
of revocation of probation and re-sentencing in Cr. No. 94-189K 
qualifies as an appealable post-judgment order. See Johnson, 96 
Hawai'i at 469, 471, 32 P.3d at 113, 115 (noting that a criminal 
defendant may appeal from an order that disposes of a motion for 
revocation of probation and such an appeal encompasses any issues 
that may arise relating to the revocation). 
The State's argument, that Johnson had to appeal from
 
re-sentencing orders in 2001 and 2006 to now raise the issue of
 
the May 16, 2000 dismissal order, is based on no cited authority
 
and we conclude it has no merit. Moreover, contrary to the
 
State's apparent argument that Johnson's appeal presents a matter
 
of original jurisdiction, the appeal is properly taken from an
 
appealable post-judgment order.

We therefore deem it appropriate to exercise
 
jurisdiction for this appeal.
 
(2) On appeal, Johnson contends that it was plain error
 
for the circuit court to re-sentence him to five years in prison
 
in Cr. No. 94-189k, where the record in that case contains an
 
order of discharge and dismissal. We agree that, without the
 
circuit court addressing the order of discharge and dismissal,
 
there was plain error.
 
Hawai'i Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 52(b) provides 
that "[p]lain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may 
be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the 
court." An appellate court will therefore "apply the plain error 
standard of review to correct errors which seriously affect the 
fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial 
proceedings, to serve the ends of justice, and to prevent the 
denial of fundamental rights." State v. Malivao, 105 Hawai' i 
414, 417, 98 P.3d 285, 288 (App. 2004) (citation omitted). Nonetheless, the Hawai' i Supreme Court has cautioned that an 
appellate "court's power to deal with plain error is one to be exercised with caution because the plain error rule is a 
departure from the position usually presupposed by the adversary 
system that parties must look to counsel for protection and must 
bear the cost of counsel's mistakes." State v. Nguyen, 81 
Hawai'i 279, 292, 916 P.2d 689, 702 (1996) (citation omitted). 
Therefore, an appellate court's "power to deal with plain error 
is a power to be exercised sparingly and with caution." Id. at 
293, 916 P.2d at 703 (citation omitted). 
In the instant case, the parties failed to timely bring
 
the existence of the May 16, 2000 order of discharge and
 dismissal to the attention of the circuit court. Under the
 
apparent erroneous assumption that no such order existed, the
 
circuit court re-sentenced Johnson to five years in prison for a
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
charge that the record indicates was dismissed. On this record,
 
Johnson's substantial rights were affected by this new five year
 
prison sentence. Accordingly, it was plain error for the circuit
 
court to re-sentence Johnson to a five year term of imprisonment
 
in Cr. No. 94-189K where the record in that case contains an
 
order of discharge and dismissal. The record in Cr. No. 94-189K,
 
however, also shows that on November 18, 2009, the State filed a
 
motion to correct clerical error regarding the dismissal order. 
The State's motion to correct clerical error apparently was not
 
addressed because the case by then was on appeal. We determine
 
that, on remand, the circuit court should address the State's
 
motion to correct clerical error.
 
Finally, we note that Johnson fails to present any 
argument regarding the circuit court's August 14, 2009 order of 
revocation of probation and re-sentencing filed in Cr. No. 01-1­
0004k. Johnson has thus waived any issues regarding the appeal 
in that case. See State v. Guidry, 105 Hawai' i 222, 236, 96 P.3d 
242, 256 (2004) (citing Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 
28(b)(7) for the proposition that points not argued may be deemed 
waived). 
We therefore assert jurisdiction and: (1) in
 
Cr. No. 94-189K, we vacate the circuit court's order, filed on
 
August 14, 2009, revoking probation and re-sentencing Johnson to
 
a term of five years in prison; and (2) in Cr. No. 01-1-0004K, we
 
affirm the circuit court's order, filed August 14, 2009, revoking
 
probation and re-sentencing Johnson to a term of five years in
 
prison for his custodial interference in the first degree
 
conviction. We remand for: further proceedings in Cr. No. 94­
189K to address the State's motion to correct clerical error, to
 
determine the validity of the circuit court's May 16, 2000 Order
 
of Discharge and Dismissal, and for any further proceedings
 
consistent with this opinion; and further proceedings in

Cr. No. 01-1-0004K to the extent it is deemed necessary by the
 
circuit court to address the consecutive sentencing in
 
Cr. No. 94-189K and Cr. No. 01-1-0004K.
