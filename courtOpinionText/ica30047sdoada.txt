IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
TOGIASO DURAN, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
KANE'OHE DIVISION
 
(Case No. 1DTC-08-032491)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Tagiaso Duran (Duran) appeals the 
Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment 
entered on August 7, 2009, in the District Court of the First 
Circuit, K ane'ohe Division (district court).1 
Duran was convicted of Excessive Speeding, in violation 
of Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 291C-105(a)(1) (2007). 
On appeal, Duran contends that the district court 
abused its discretion in admitting the laser gun reading without 
adequate foundation of officer training and laser gun testing 
consistent with the manufacturer's recommendations, and that, 
without evidence of speed, insufficient evidence exists to 
sustain the conviction. The State argues that the error was 
waived because Duran did not object to admissibility of the speed 
reading based on any lack of foundation. Duran counters that 
defense counsel's "questions were designed to challenge [Officer 
Shermon Dowkin's (Officer Dowkin)] qualifications and the 
accuracy of the particular laser gun" and that the court 
intervened and found, based on the officer's qualification and 
training, that the laser gun was working properly.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Duran's points of error as follows.
 
(1) Duran waived his challenge to Officer Dowkin's 
testimony regarding the laser gun reading where Duran failed to 
make any objection prior to the officer's testimony establishing 
Duran's speed, nor did he object to a lack of foundation at 
anytime during trial, and no basis for plain error review exists. 
State v. Wallace, 80 Hawai 'i 382, 409-10, 910 P.2d 695, 722-23 
(1996); State v. Naeole, 62 Haw. 563, 570, 617 P.2d 820, 826 (1980). See also State v. Winfrey, No. 28737 (Haw. December 22, 
2009) (order affirming judgment on appeal). 
(2) There was sufficient evidence presented that Duran 
committed the offense of excessive speeding. Officer Dowkin testified that he observed Duran pass two posted City and County 
35 mile-per-hour speed signs on Pali Highway. Officer Dowkin 
further testified that the laser gun reflected Duran's speed at 
68 miles per hour. Evidence of the laser gun speed reading, 
"even though incompetent, if admitted without objection or motion 
to strike, is to be given the same probative force as that to 
which it would be entitled if it were competent." Wallace, 80 
Hawai
'i at 410, 910 P.2d at 723 (quoting 2 Wharton's Criminal 
Evidence ยง 265 n.3 (14th ed. 1986) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Accordingly, taken in the light most favorable to the 
State, State v. Grace, 107 Hawai
'i 133, 139, 111 P.3d 28, 34 
(App. 2005), there was sufficient evidence for the conviction. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the Notice of Entry of
 
Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, entered on August 7,
