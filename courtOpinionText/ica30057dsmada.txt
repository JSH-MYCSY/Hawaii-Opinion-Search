NO. 30057
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
AMERICAN HOME MORTGAGE SERVICING, INC., Plaintiff-Appellee, 
v.
 
KIN-CHUNG ROCKY YEUNG, Defendant-Appellant 
and
 
JOHN and MARY DOES 1-10, Defendants
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 09-1-0816)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record in this case, it appears that
 
we lack jurisdiction over the appeal that Defendant-Appellant
 
Kin-Chung Rocky Yeung (Appellant Yeung) has asserted from the
 Honorable Bert I. Ayabe's September 2, 2009 announcement in
 circuit court minutes that the circuit court intends to grant
 Plaintiff-Appellee American Home Mortgage Servicing, Inc.'s
 (Appellee American Home Mortgage Servicing) motion for summary
 judgment, because the record on appeal does not contain a
 separate, appealable final judgment that resolves all claims in
 this case.
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)§ 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 
2008) authorizes appeals to the intermediate court of appeals only from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of the court." HRS § 641-1(c). Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP) requires that "[e]very judgment shall be NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
set forth on a separate document." Based on HRCP Rule 58, the 
Supreme Court of Hawai 'i has held that "[a]n appeal may be 
taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. 
Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 
1334, 1338 (1994). Thus, "an order disposing of a circuit court case is appealable when the order is reduced to a separate judgment." Alford v. City and Count of Honolulu, 109 Hawai
'i 14, 
20, 122 P.3d 809, 815 (2005) (citation omitted) (emphasis added)). "An appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Jenkins, 76 
Hawai
'i at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted). 
The appellate court clerk filed the record on appeal 
for this appellate case on November 10, 2009, at which time the record did not contain a final judgment that resolves all claims against all parties in this case. The record on appeal also did not contain a dispositive written order. The circuit court has merely indicated through the circuit court minutes that the circuit court orally announced its intention to enter a written order granting Appellee American Home Mortgage Servicing's motion for summary judgment. As the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has 
explained, "a minute order is not an appealable order." Abrams 
v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai 'i 319, 321 n.3, 966 
P.2d 631, 633 n.3 (1998) (emphasis added). Absent an appealable final judgment in the record on appeal, Appellant Yeung's appeal is premature and we lack appellate jurisdiction.

Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is
 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
