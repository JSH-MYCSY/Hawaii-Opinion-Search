NO. 30057
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
AMERICAN HOME MORTGAGE SERVICING, INC., Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
KIN-CHUNG ROCKY YEUNG, Defendant-Appellant, and
JOHN and MARY DOES 1-10, Defendants.
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 09-1-0816)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Kin-Chung Rocky Yeung (Yeung), pro
 
se, appeals from the Judgment issued in favor of Plaintiff-
Appellee American Home Mortgage Servicing, Inc. (AHMSI), filed on
 
November 9, 2009 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 
(Circuit Court).1 The Circuit Court's judgment was issued
 
pursuant to its order granting AHMSI's motion for summary
 judgment and for writ of possession filed on November 9, 2009. 
AHMSI initiated this action seeking to eject Yeung from
 
the subject property. In support of its motion for summary
 
judgment and for writ of possession, AHMSI submitted declarations
 
and exhibits establishing that:
 
1 The Honorable Bert I. Ayabe presided.

(a) On February 20, 2009, AHMSI conducted a non-
judicial foreclosure of the subject property under a power of
 
sale in a first mortgage duly noted on Transfer Certificate of
 
Title (TCT) No. 674,147; 
(b) On March 24, 2009, a Mortgagee's Quitclaim Deed 
was recorded with the Office of the Assistant Registrar of the 
Land Court of the State of Hawai 'i which specified that AHMSI was 
the owner of the Property. The Mortgagee's Quitclaim Deed was recorded under new TCT No. 940,642. 
Yeung did not challenge these facts.
 On November 9, 2009, the Circuit Court issued an Order
 
Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and for Writ of
 Ejectment Against Defendant Kin-Chung Rocky Yeung and the
 
Judgment.
 
On appeal, Yeung's Opening Brief is substantially non­
compliant with Rule 28 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) in that it fails to set forth the relevant facts, citation to the record where any alleged error can be 
found, and argument in support of his point of error. 
Nonetheless, this court provides pro se appellants wide latitude 
when construing an opening brief and will address Yeung's one 
discernable claim that "[t]he Appellant respectfully ask[s] the 
Appellate Court to look into the facts of this case to determine 
if the Appellee is the rightful owner of this loan." 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Yeung's point of error as follows:
 
(1) The Property is registered property with the Land 
Court making it subject to the provisions of Chapter 501 of the 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS). See Aames Funding Corp. v. Mores, 
107 Hawai
'i 95, 110 P.3d 1042 (2005). The Mortgagee's Quitclaim

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Deed recorded on March 24, 2009 with the Assistant Registrar of 
the Land Court specifies AHMSI as owner of the property and 
reflects that new TCT No. 940,642 was issued. "[C]onclusive 
effect is to be given the certificate of title on the question of 
title to land." Id. at 101, 110 P.3d at 1048. A new certificate 
of title is binding upon the registered owner and all persons claiming under the registered owner. HRS § 501-106(b) (2006 
Repl.). "[D]efenses to mortgages foreclosed upon by exercise of 
the mortgagee's power of sale must be raised 'prior to the entry 
of a new certificate of title.'" Aames Funding Corp., 107 
Hawai
'i at 102, 110 P.3d at 1049. Any challenge to whether AHMSI 
was the legal owner of the promissory note for which the subject 
property was mortgaged, and thus any challenge to the foreclosure 
proceedings, was limited to the period before entry of the new 
certificate of title. AHMSI is the title holder of the subject 
property and Yeung provided no valid defense to the ejectment 
action. 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment issued in favor
 
of Plaintiff-Appellee American Home Mortgage Servicing, Inc.,
 filed on November 9, 2009 in the Circuit Court of the First
 
Circuit is affirmed.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
