In Case No. 2DTA-08-01628, pursuant to Stone's guilty
 
plea, he was convicted of: Operating a Vehicle Under the
 
Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII) in violation of HRS § 291E­
61(a) (Supp. 2008); and Driving Without a License (DWOL) in
 
violation of HRS § 286-102 (2007 Repl.).
 
In Case No. 2DTC-08-011610, pursuant to Stone's guilty
 
plea, he was convicted of: Operating a Vehicle After License
 
Revoked in violation of HRS § 291E-62; and Driving Without No-
Fault Insurance in violation of HRS § 431:10C-104 (2005 Repl.).
 
In Case No. 2DTC-09-009261, pursuant to Stone's no
 
contest plea, he was convicted of Operating a Vehicle After
 
License Revoked in violation of HRS § 291E-62.
 
On appeal, Stone raises the following points of error: 
(1) with respect to Case No. 2DTA-08-01628: (a) the 
District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the OVUII offense because the charge failed to allege an essential element, 
that Stone operated a vehicle upon a public way, street, road, or 
highway, as required under State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai' i 383, 219 
P.3d 1170 (2009); and (b) the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the DWOL offense because the charge 
failed to allege that Stone "was not excepted by statute from the 
driver's licensing requirements[.]"; 
(2) with respect to Case Nos. 2DTA-08-00722, 2DTC-08­
011610, and 2DTC-09-009261, the District Court lacked subject
 
matter jurisdiction over the offenses of Operating a Vehicle
 
After License Revoked because each of the charges failed to
 
allege an essential element, that Stone operated a vehicle upon a
 
public way, street, road, or highway, as required under Wheeler.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
affirm the judgment in each case and resolve Stone's points of
 
error as follows.
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
We first address the State's contention that Stone's
 
notice of appeal was defective and thus failed to invoke
 
appellate jurisdiction. The District Court entered two sets of
 
judgments, the first set on July 14, 2009 and subsequently
 
another set on September 1, 2009, which amended Stone's
 
sentences. Stone filed his notice of appeal on September 14,
 
2009, within thirty days of the September 1, 2009 judgments. 
However, the notice of appeal indicated the appeal was from the
 
July 14, 2009 judgments and copies of those judgments were
 
attached thereto.
 
Although Stone's notice of appeal should have
 
referenced that the appeal was from the judgments entered on
 
September 1, 2009, this error does not prevent appellate
 
jurisdiction in this appeal.
 
With respect to multiple judgments, the supreme court
 
has explained as follows:
 
The general rule is that where a judgment is amended in a
material and substantial respect, the time within which an
appeal from such determination may be taken begins to run
from the date of the amendment, although where the amendment
relates only to the correction of a clerical error, it does
not affect the time allowed for appeal.
 
Poe v. Hawai' i Labor Relations Bd., 98 Hawai' i 416, 418, 49 P.3d 
382, 384 (2002) (citation, and ellipsis omitted); 
see also State 
v. Mainaaupo, 117 Hawai' i 235, 246 n.6, 178 P.3d 1, 12 n.6 
(2008). Because the September 1, 2009 judgments materially and 
substantially altered the July 14, 2009 judgments by modifying 
Stone's sentences, Stone should have appealed from the latter 
judgments. However, under the standard articulated in State v. 
Bohannon, "a mistake in designating the judgment . . . should not 
result in loss of the appeal as long as the intent to appeal from a specific judgment can be fairly inferred from the notice and the appellee is not misled by the mistake." 102 Hawai' i 228, 
235, 74 P.3d 980, 987 (2003) (quoting City & Cnty. of Honolulu v. 
Midkiff, 57 Haw. 273, 275-76, 554 P.2d 233, 235 (1976)).

Moreover, Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 
3(c)(2) states, in relevant part that "[a]n appeal shall not be 
dismissed for informality of form or title of the notice of 
appeal." 
The State does not argue that it could not be fairly
 
inferred that Stone intended to appeal the September 1, 2009
 
judgments, nor does the State argue that it was misled by the
 
mistake. Moreover, the State did not file a statement contesting
 
jurisdiction as allowed by HRAP Rule 12.1(a). Rather, the State
 
filed an answering brief addressing the merits of Stone's appeal,
 
and raises the question of jurisdiction as an initial argument.2
 
We therefore conclude that we have jurisdiction to hear this
 appeal.
 
(1) Because the respective charges did not allege that
 
Stone operated a vehicle upon a public way, street, road, or
 
highway as required in Wheeler, Stone contends that the charges
 
were defective and that the District Court thus lacked subject
 
matter jurisdiction: in Case No. 2DTA-08-01628 as to the OVUII
 
offense; and in Case Nos. 2DTA-08-00722, 2DTC-08-011610 and 2DTC­
09-009261 as to the offenses in those cases of Operating a
 
Vehicle After License Revoked.
 
Stone did not object to any of the subject charges at 
any point in the District Court proceedings and instead raises 
the issue for the first time on appeal. In Wheeler, the Hawai' i 
Supreme Court stated that: 
this court has applied different principles depending on
whether or not an objection was timely raised in the trial
court. Under the "Motta/Wells post-conviction liberal
construction rule," we liberally construe charges challengedfor the first time on appeal. See Merino, 81 Hawai' i at 
212, 915 P.2d at 686; Wells, 78 Hawai' i at 381, 894 P.2d at 
78; Elliott, 77 Hawai' i at 311, 884 P.2d at 374; State v. 
2
 The State's reliance on State v. Kilborn, 109 Hawai' i 435, 127 P.3d
95 (App. 2005) is misplaced. In Kilborn, unlike this case, the district court
expressly left open the possibility that it would include restitution in thesentence and had not yet decided that issue when the appeal was taken.Kilborn is thus inapposite.

Motta, 66 Haw. 89, 90, 657 P.2d 1019, 1019-20 (1983). Under 
this approach, there is a "presumption of validity,"
Sprattling, 99 Hawai' i at 318, 55 P.3d at 282, for charges
challenged subsequent to a conviction. In those 
circumstances, this court will "not reverse a convictionbased upon a defective indictment [or complaint] unless thedefendant can show prejudice or that the indictment [orcomplaint] cannot within reason be construed to charge a
crime." Merino, 81 Hawai' i at 212, 915 P.2d at 686
(citation omitted). 
121 Hawai' i at 399-400, 219 P.3d at 1186-87. 
In Wheeler, the Hawai' i Supreme Court further noted 
that:
 
in determining whether a defendant has been adequately
informed of the charges against him, the appellate court can
consider other information in addition to the charge that
may have been provided to the defendant during the course of
the case up until the time defendant objected to the
sufficiency of the charges against him.

Wheeler, 121 Hawai' i at 396, 219 P.3d at 1183;  see State v.
Sprattling, 99 Hawai' i 312, 318-21, 55 P.3d 276, 282-85 (2002)

to overcome presumption of valid charge under the Motta/Wells 
3 In State v. Hitchcock, 123 Hawai' i 369, 235 P.3d 365 (2010), the
Hawai'i Supreme Court addressed an untimely challenge to the sufficiency of
the charge and reaffirmed past case decisions that look at the information
provided to the defendant up to the point a court rules on the challenge to
the charge:
 
Moreover, this court has stated that,
 
in determining whether the accused's right to be
informed of the nature and cause of the accusation
 
against him [or her] has been violated, we must look
 to all of the information supplied to him [or her] by
 
the State to the point where the court passes upon the
 contention that the right has been violated.

(emphasis added) (citing State v. Treat, 67 Haw. 119, 120, 680 
P.2d 250, 251 (1984); State v. Robins, 66 Haw. 312, 317, 660 P.2d
39, 42-43 (1983)) (other citation omitted) (brackets in original).This court additionally stated that a defendant's right to beinformed of the nature and cause of the accusation can be deemed satisfied if the record "clearly demonstrate[s] the defendant's
actual knowledge" of the charges against him or her. Id. at 71,

standard); State v. Treat, 67 Haw. 119, 120, 680 P.2d 250, 251
 
(1984) (dismissal of indictment reversed because, prior to
 
consideration of dismissal motion, defendant "had been supplied
 
with the grand jury transcript which clearly established the
 
details of the crime, [and] he had been fully informed of the
 
nature and cause of the accusation against him."). 
In this case, Stone does not attempt to make any 
showing that the requirements of the Motta/Wells rule are met. 
Indeed, although the State argued the application of the 
Motta/Wells rule in its answering brief, Stone did not file a 
reply brief and thus does not address the Motta/Wells rule. 
Instead, Stone's contention is that because the charges were 
defective pursuant to Wheeler, under cases such as State v. 
Cummings, 101 Hawai' i 139, 63 P.3d 1109 (2003), the District 
Court did not have jurisdiction to convict him. The Hawai' i 
Supreme Court, however, has continued to recognize the validity 
of the Motta/Wells rule, both in Wheeler and post-Wheeler. See 
State v. Tominiko, 126 Hawai' i 68, 76, 266 P.3d 1122, 1130 
(2011); Hitchcock, 123 Hawai' i at 379, 235 P.3d at 375. 
Because Stone did not timely raise any objection to the
 
sufficiency of the subject charges before he was convicted in the
 
District Court, the Motta/Wells liberal construction standard is
 
applicable. Under this standard, the validity of the charges is
 
presumed and the convictions will not be reversed unless Stone
 
can show: (a) prejudice; or (b) that the charges cannot within
 
reason be construed to charge a crime.
 
Stone makes no attempt to carry his burden under the
 
Motta/Wells rule and thus has waived any challenge on the issue
 
of prejudice and whether the charge can within reason be
 
construed to charge a crime. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(7) ("Points not
 
argued may be deemed waived.").
 
Even if we were to reach those issues, the record
 
indicates that Stone cannot show that he was prejudiced or that
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the charges cannot within reason be construed to charge a crime. 
In each of the underlying cases, Stone plead guilty or no contest
 
to the respective charges and as part of his plea admitted that
 
he understood the charges against him. There is also no showing
 
that for any of the subject offenses, Stone was operating his
 
vehicle somewhere other than on a public way, street, road, or
 
highway. 
In Case No. 2DTA-08-01628, during the hearing for his 
guilty plea, Stone was informed of the factual basis for the 
charge which apprised him that he was being charged for conduct 
that occurred upon a public roadway. Specifically, the deputy 
prosecutor stated on the record that the offense occurred on the 
8th day of October 2008, in the County of Maui, State of Hawai' i, 
and "[t]his was specifically on Kahului Beach Road, Wahinepio in Kahului, defendant was observed to be operating his vehicle upon 
a public roadway of the State." (Emphasis added). 
In Case No. 2DTA-08-00722, Case No. 2DTC-08-011610, and
 
Case No. 2DTC-09-009261, the respective Amended Complaints set
 
forth two charges, Operating a Vehicle After License Revoked and
 
Driving Without No-Fault Insurance. In Case No. 2DTA-08-00722,
 
both charges were alleged to have occurred on or about
 
December 13, 2007. In Case No. 2DTC-08-011610, both charges were
 
alleged to have occurred on or about December 24, 2008. In Case
 
No. 2DTC-09-009261, both charges were alleged to have occurred on
 
or about May 22, 2009. In each of these Amended Complaints, the
 
charge for Driving Without No-Fault Insurance specifically stated
 
that the offense occurred when Stone operated a vehicle "upon any
 
public street, road, or highway of this State[.]" Thus, when the
 
Amended Complaint in each of these cases is read as a whole, it
 
can be reasonably inferred that the charges therein refer to the
 
same incident and that the charge for Operating a Vehicle After
 
License Revoked was for conduct that occurred on a public street,
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
road, or highway.4 See Tominiko, 126 Hawai' i at 76-77, 266 P.3d 
at 1130-31. 
Moreover, in Case No. 2DTC-08-011610, prior to Stone's
 
challenge to the sufficiency of this charge, he was informed of
 
the factual basis for his guilty plea, which further apprised
 
Stone that he was being charged for conduct that occurred on a
 
public roadway.5 Similarly, in Case No. 2DTC-09-009261, Stone
 
was informed of the factual basis for his no-contest plea,
 including that he was stopped on Papa Avenue in Kahului.
6
 
Under the Motta/Wells analysis, we thus reject Stone's
 
untimely challenge to the sufficiency of the respective charges
 
and his assertion that the District Court lacked subject matter
 
jurisdiction to convict him.
 
4 Although the charge for Driving Without No-Fault Insurance was
dismissed as part of the plea agreements in Case No. 2DTA-08-0722 and Case No.
2DTC-09-009261, this does not affect the analysis as to whether the charge forOperating a Vehicle After License Revoked was sufficient. When read as a whole, the Amended Complaints in these cases still apprised Stone that he wasbeing charged for conduct that occurred on a public roadway. See Tominiko, 
126 Hawai' i at 76-77, 266 P.3d at 1130-31.
5 Specifically, the State provided the following factual basis before
the District Court accepted Stone's plea:
 
this occurred on the 24th day of December 2008. The
 defendant was observed to be operating a vehicle upon a
public roadway of this state. This was in the division of
 Wailuku, County of Maui, State of Hawaii. Officers observed
 an expired tax decal, made the traffic stop, defendant was
identified as the operator. At the time he could not
 produce insurance for the vehicle. He was the registered
 owner. And he also could not produce a valid license.
Check with vehicle license revealed his license was
 suspended for OUI previously. 
6
 The State provided the following factual basis for Stone's no-contest
plea:
 
[T]he facts are that on or about May 22nd, 2009, the
defendant was stopped for not having a seat belt on as an
operator. Upon stop, the defendant was found to have a
suspended or revoked driver's license for OUI as well as the
fact that he was unable to provide a valid motor vehicle
insurance policy. He was also stopped on I believe it's –­
Papa Avenue in Kahului.
 
(Emphasis added).
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2) Stone's remaining point of error is that, in Case
 
No. 2DTA-08-01628, the District Court lacked subject matter
 
jurisdiction over the DWOL offense because the charge failed to
 
allege that Stone "was not excepted by statute from the driver's
 
licensing requirements." 
HRS § 286-102 (2007 Repl.) provides, in relevant part:
 
§286-102 Licensing.  (a) No person, except one
exempted under section 286-105, one who holds an instruction
permit under section 286-110, one who hold a provisional
license under section 286-102.6, one who holds a commercial
driver's license issued under section 286-239, or one who
holds a commercial driver's license instruction permit
issued under section 286-236, shall operate any category of
motor vehicles listed in this section without first being
appropriately examined and duly licensed as a qualified
driver of that category of motor vehicles.
 
(Emphasis added). The DWOL charge in Case No. 2DTA-08-01628 did
 
not allege that Stone was not exempted from the driver's
 
licensing requirements of HRS § 286-102.
 
The parties dispute whether, under HRS § 286-102, a 
required element of the DWOL offense is that Stone "was not 
excepted by statute from the driver's licensing requirements." 
Relying on 
State v. Matautia, 81 Hawai' i 76, 912 P.2d 573 (App. 
1996), Stone argues that it is a required element. He thus asserts that the charge was deficient without such allegations 
being included. To the contrary, the State argues under State v. 
Romano, 114 Hawai' i 1, 155 P.3d 1102 (2007), State v. Lee, 90 
Hawai'i 130, 976 P.2d 444 (App. 1999), and State v. Nobriga, 10 
Haw. App. 353, 873 P.2d 110 (1994), overruled on other grounds by 
State v. Maelega, 80 Hawai' i 172, 178-79, 907 P.2d 758, 764-65 
(1995), that because the exceptions contained in other provisions 
are only referenced in HRS § 286-102 and are not an integral part 
of defining the DWOL offense, they are defenses and not part of 
the elements of the offense. 
We need not decide for purposes of this case whether a
 
required element of the DWOL offense is that Stone "was not
 
excepted by statute from the driver's licensing requirements." 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
As stated earlier, Stone did not object to the sufficiency of the 
DWOL charge at any point before the District Court and raises 
this issue for the first time on appeal. Thus, the Motta/Wells 
rule applies. See Tominiko, 126 Hawai' i at 76, 266 P.3d at 1130. 
Stone fails to make any argument under the Motta/Wells rule, does not attempt to carry his burden to show that he was prejudiced or 
that the DWOL charge cannot within reason be construed to charge 
a crime, and he has therefore waived any challenge on these 
issues. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(7). 
THEREFORE,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the Judgments entered by the
 
District Court on September 1, 2009 in Case Nos. 2DTA-08-00722,
 2DTA-08-01628, 2DTC-08-011610, and 2DTC-09-009261 are affirmed.
