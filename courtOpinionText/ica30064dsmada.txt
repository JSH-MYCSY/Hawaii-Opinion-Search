NO. 30064
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
 
v.
 
DUANE LIUPAONO, Defendant-Appellee,
 
and
 
ACE BAIL BONDS, Real Party in Interest/Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 99-2055)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
 
FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
jurisdiction over the appeal that Real-Party-in-Interest/
 
Appellant Ace Bail Bonds, L.L.C. (Appellant Ace Bail Bonds), has
 asserted from the Honorable Richard K. Perkins' August 18, 2009
 "Order Denying Ace Bail Bond's Motion to Reconsider Denial of
 Motion to Set-Aside Bail Forfeiture" (the August 18, 2009 order
 denying Appellant Ace Bail Bonds's motion to reconsider denial of
 motion to set aside bail forfeiture) because, under the
 circumstances of this case, the August 18, 2009 order denying
 Appellant Ace Bail Bonds's motion to reconsider denial of motion
 to set aside bail forfeiture is not an appealable order under
 Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 804-51 (Supp. 2008).
 
"The right to an appeal is strictly statutory." State
 
v. Ontiveros, 82 Hawai
'i 446, 449, 923 P.2d 388, 391 (1996) 
(citation omitted). "Any party deeming oneself aggrieved by the NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
judgment of a circuit court in a criminal matter, may appeal to 
the intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 602 in the manner and within the time provided by the rules of the court." HRS § 641-11 (Supp. 2008). However, it appears that HRS § 641-11 does not apply to this case, because a proceeding involving the "forfeiture of a bond is a civil proceeding." State v. Camara, 
81 Hawai
'i 324, 329 n.7, 916 P.2d 1225, 1230 n.7 (1996) (citation 
omitted). The supreme court has explained that the statute authorizing an appeal from a bail bond forfeiture proceeding is HRS § 804-51, and 
the appealable event is the order denying the motion to set
aside the judgment of forfeiture.
Once a motion to set aside is denied, the surety may
appeal such denial "as in the case of a final judgment."
Pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule
4(a)(1), a notice of appeal from a final judgment must be
filed within thirty days from the date of entry of the
judgment - in this case, thirty days from the order denying
the motion to set aside.
 
State v. Camara, 81 Hawai 'i at 329, 916 P.2d at 1230 (footnote 
omitted). Thus, in the instant case, the August 18, 2009 order 
denying Appellant Ace Bail Bonds's motion to reconsider denial of motion to set aside bail forfeiture might appear to be an appealable order pursuant to HRS § 804-51. 
Nevertheless, it also appears that a prerequisite to a
 
motion to set aside a bail forfeiture is the entry of a judgment
 on the bail forfeiture. "Whenever the court, in any criminal
 cause, forfeits any bond or recognizance given in a criminal
 cause, the court shall immediately enter up judgment in favor of
 the State and against the principal or principals and surety or
 sureties on the bond, jointly and severally, for the full amount
 of the penalty thereof[.]" HRS § 804-51 (emphasis added). In
 fact, the supreme court has expressly
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
recognize[d] that HRS §§ 804-1, -7.4(2), -17, and -51, . . .
read in pari materia, . . . mandate that, upon a defendant's
unexcused failure to appear for a court proceeding, (1) the
defendant's "default shall be entered," (2) the default
"shall be evidence of the breach of [an] appearance bond[],"
and (3) if the defendant's bail bond is forfeited, "the
court shall immediately" enter a forfeiture judgment in
favor of the State and against the defendant and his or her
surety.
 
State v. Ranger Insurance Company, 83 Hawai 'i 118, 122, 925 P.2d 
288, 292 (1996) (citations omitted; emphases added). After a 
court has filed a bail forfeiture judgment, then "before the expiration of thirty days from the date that notice is given to the surety or sureties on the bond of the entry of the judgment in favor of the State," the "principal" may file "a motion or application . . . showing good cause why execution should not issue upon the judgment[.]" HRS § 804-51. However, the record on appeal in this case does not contain a written judgment in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai
'i (the State) and 
against Appellant Ace Bail Bonds on the forfeiture of Appellant Ace Bail Bonds' bail bond. Under analogous situations in civil cases involving motions to set aside final orders or judgments, Hawai
'i courts have noted that "a motion for reconsideration 
pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b), is authorized only in situations involving final judgments." Cho v. State, 115 Hawai
'i 373, 382, 
168 P.3d 17, 26 (2007) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Similarly, under HRS § 804-51, a motion to set aside a bail forfeiture judgment is authorized only in situations when the trial court has entered a bail forfeiture judgment. In fact, we note that, although the August 18, 2009 order purports to deny Appellant Ace Bail Bonds's motion to "reconsider" the denial of a 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
motion to set aside a bail forfeiture, the record on appeal
 
•	 does not contain a bail forfeiture judgment,
•	 does not contain a motion to set aside a bail
 
forfeiture judgment, and
•	 does not contain an order denying a motion to set
aside a bail forfeiture judgment.
•
 
Ace Bail Bonds did not have the right to file a motion to
 
"reconsider" an order denying a motion to set aside a bail
 forfeiture judgment where the existence of the underlying matters
 has not been established. Therefore, the August 18, 2009 order
 denying Appellant Ace Bail Bonds's motion to reconsider denial of
 motion to set aside bail forfeiture has not been shown to be an
 appealable order under HRS § 804-51.
 
Absent an appealable order or judgment, we lack
 
appellate jurisdiction. 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number 30064 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
