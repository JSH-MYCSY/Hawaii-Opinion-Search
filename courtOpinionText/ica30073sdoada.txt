STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
JEREMIAH J. KEENAN, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
WAILUKU DIVISION
 
(CR. NO. 2P108-01155)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Jeremiah J. Keenan (Keenan) appeals
 
from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order (Judgment)
 
entered on August 18, 2009 in the District Court of the Second
 
Circuit, Wailuku Division (District Court).1
 
Keenan was convicted of Prohibitions Involving Minors,
 
in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 281-101.5 (2007
 
Repl.).
 
On appeal, Keenan contends: (1) there was insufficient
 
evidence to convict him because the State failed to adduce
 
evidence that the liquid in the bottle was "liquor" for purposes
 
of HRS ยง 281-101.5; and (2) the Complaint was defective because
 
the charge was stated in the disjunctive and did not track the

language of the statute, and he had raised the issue in a motion
 
for judgment of acquittal.
 
The State argues that there was sufficient evidence to
 
support Keenan's conviction, but concedes that the Complaint was
 
fatally defective because it was phrased in the disjunctive.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Keenan's points of error as follows:
 
The Complaint was fatally defective because it did not, 
in any cognizable or reasonable fashion, state the essential 
elements of the offense. See State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai 'i 383, 
219 P.3d 1170 (2009). The phrasing of the Complaint utilizing the word "or" multiple times, combined with a failure of the 
Complaint to track the language of the statute (and instead 
reordering the language of the statute), rendered the Complaint 
incomprehensible. 
Because we conclude that the Complaint against Keenan
 
was fatally defective, we do not address Keenan's other point of
 
error.
 
Therefore, the Judgment filed on August 18, 2009 in the
 
District Court is vacated and the case is remanded to the
 
District Court with instructions to dismiss the charge without
 
prejudice.
