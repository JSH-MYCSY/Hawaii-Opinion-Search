STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
JOHNNY T. TAPUSOA, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
HONOLULU DIVISION
(CASE NO. 1DTC-08-044459)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Johnny T. Tapusoa ( Tapusoa) appeals
from the Judgment, entered on August 26, 2009, in the District
Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (District Court).1 
Tapusoa was convicted of Excessive Speeding, in violation of
Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 291C-105 (Supp. 2009). 
On appeal, Tapusoa contends, inter alia , that there was
insufficient evidence to establish the accuracy of the laser gun
in accordance with State v. Assaye, 121 Hawai #i 204, 216 P.3d
1227 (2009). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Tapusoa's points of error as follows:
As the State acknowledges on appeal, there was
insufficient evidence to convict Tapusoa of Excessive Speeding
because the State failed to adduce evidence that the laser gun
was tested according to the manufacturer recommended procedures
in order to establish sufficient foundation for the laser gun
reading.  See Assaye, 121 Hawai #i at 214, 216 P.3d at 1237. 
Without this evidence, there was insufficient evidence to supportNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2The evidence was admitted over the objection of the defense based
on lack of foundation and lack of scientific evidence.
2Tapusoa's conviction for Excessive Speeding.2  We need not
address Tapusoa's other point of error.  
For this reason, the District Court's August 26, 2009
Judgment is reversed.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, June 17, 2010.
