IN THE MATTER OF THE TAX APPEAL
 
OF
 
DANIEL AREGGER & SUSAN ROGERS-AREGGER,
Appellants-Appellants,
v.

NO. 30078
 
APPEAL FROM THE TAX APPEAL COURT

 
(CASE NO. 08-0110)
 
NOVEMBER 18, 2010

 
FOLEY, PRESIDING J., FUJISE AND LEONARD, JJ.
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY FOLEY, PRESIDING J.
 
Appellants-Appellants Daniel Aregger and Susan Rogers-
Aregger (the Areggers) appeal from the "Order Granting Appellee
 
Director of Taxation, State of Hawaii's Motion to Dismiss (Filed
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
April 21, 2009)" filed on August 26, 2009 in the Tax Appeal Court
 
1
of the State of Hawai 'i  (tax appeal court).  Appellee-Appellee 
Director of Taxation, State of Hawai 'i, (the Director) filed a 
motion to dismiss the Areggers' appeal on the grounds that the 
tax appeal court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the 
appeal because the Areggers' Notice of Appeal (Notice of Appeal) 
had not been timely served on the Director pursuant to Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 232-17 (Supp. 2007). 
The issue on appeal is whether the tax appeal court had

 
subject matter jurisdiction over the tax appeal.
 
I.
 
On October 1, 2008, the Board of Taxation Review, First
 
Taxation District (the Board) filed a Decision in which the Board
 
found in favor of the Director in the amount of $7,308.37 and
 
against the Areggers, as taxpayers, and determined that the
 
evidence demonstrated the assessment was proper and valid.
 
On October 29, 2008, the Areggers appealed to the tax
 
appeal court from the Board's Decision. A certificate of service
 
attached to the Notice of Appeal shows that a copy of the notice
 
was mailed to "Mr. D. Mun (Mun), Tax Returns Examiner, Office
 
Audit Branch, Department of Taxation." No copy of the Notice of
 
Appeal was sent to the Director.
 
On October 30, 2008, the clerk of the tax appeal court 
filed a Notice of Entry of Notice of Appeal to Tax Appeal Court 
(Notice of Entry) pursuant to Rule 4 of the Rules of the Tax 
Appeal Court. The certificate of service attached to the Notice 
of Entry shows that it was mailed on that date to the Areggers' 
attorney, the Department of the Attorney General of the State of 
Hawai'i, and the Director.

 The Honorable Gary W.B. Chang presided.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Director filed an answer on November 19, 2008 to
 
the Areggers' Notice of Appeal, stating, among other defenses,
 
that the tax appeal court "may lack subject matter jurisdiction."
 
On April 21, 2009, the Director filed a Motion to
 
Dismiss the Areggers' appeal for lack of subject matter
 
jurisdiction, asserting that the Areggers had failed to properly
 
serve the Director pursuant to HRS § 232-17. The tax appeal
 
court held a hearing on the motion on May 18, 2009 and, on
 
August 26, 2009, granted the motion.
 
On September 23, 2009, the Areggers timely appealed to
 
this court.
 
II.
 
The Hawai 'i Supreme Court has held that "[t]he 
interpretation of a statute is a question of law" reviewed de 
novo. Sugarman v. Kapu, 104 Hawai 'i 119, 123, 85 P.3d 644, 648 
(2004). "The court's primary obligation in construing a statute is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the 
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the language 
contained in the statute itself." Id. (internal quotation marks, 
citation, and brackets omitted). 
To determine whether a statute is mandatory or
 
directory, the supreme court observed that "the intention of the
 legislature must be ascertained." Jack Endo Elec., Inc. v. Lear
 
Siegler, Inc., 59 Haw. 612, 617, 585 P.2d 1265, 1269 (1978). "In
 general, a statute is directory rather than mandatory if the
 
provisions of the statute do not relate to the essence of the
 
thing to be done or where no substantial rights depend on
 
compliance with the particular provisions and no injury can
 
result from ignoring them." Id. 
III.
 
Rules of the Tax Appeal Court (RTAC) Rule 2(a) provides
 
in relevant part: 
3
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Rule 2. APPEALS.
 
(a) Filing.  An appeal shall be initiated by filing
with the clerk of the Tax Appeal Court a written notice of
appeal . . . . The appellant shall file a copy of such
notice with the assessor, taxpayer, and county, as the case
may be, pursuant to HRS, Sections 232-16 and 232-17, not
later than the date fixed by law for the taking of the
appeal.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
The Areggers contend it was error for the tax appeal
 
court to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction because in
 
accordance with Rule 2(a), they filed the notice with the clerk
 
of the tax appeal court and mailed a copy of the notice to Mun,
 
who was the "assessor," within the thirty-day time limit. The
 
Director contends that notwithstanding the language of Rule 2(a),
 
due to legislative amendments to HRS § 232-17 in 2007, it was
 
mandatory that notice be served on the Director, not the tax
 
assessor. The Director further contends that when the Areggers
 
failed to serve the Director within the prescribed time period,
 
the appeal was not properly commenced and the tax appeal court
 
lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the case. The
 
Areggers argue that, even though they did not serve the Director
 
directly, the Director's attorneys knew about the appeal when the
 
attorneys received the Notice of Entry on October 31, 2008. The
 
Areggers assert that any lack of service on the Director was the
 
fault of Mun "for failing to forward to his higher-ups legal
 
documents addressed to his attention."
 
We note that "an appellant's failure to file a timely
 
notice of appeal is a jurisdictional defect that can neither be
 
waived by the parties nor disregarded by the court in the
 
exercise of judicial discretion." Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648,
 
650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1129 (1986) (internal quotation marks,
 citation, and brackets omitted).

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Prior to the amendment of HRS § 232-17 in 2007, its
 
statutory language closely aligned with Rule 2(a), providing in
 
relevant part:
 
§232-17 Appeals from boards of review to tax appeal
court.  An appeal shall lie to the tax appeal court from the
decision of a state board of review . . . by the filing, by
the taxpayer . . . of a written notice of appeal in the
office of the tax appeal court within thirty days after the
filing of the decisions of the state board of review . . . .
The taxpayer shall also file a copy of the notice of appeal
in the assessor's office . . . ." 
HRS § 232-17 (2001 Repl.) (emphasis added).
 
The 2007 Hawaii Legislature amended HRS §§ 232-16 and
 
232-172
 in response to the 2006 Hawai 'i Supreme Court decision in 
Narmore v. Kawafuchi, 112 Hawai 'i 69, 71 & 82, 143 P.3d 1271, 
1273 & 1284 (2006), holding that service on the Director3 was not 
mandatory. See also H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 565, in 2007 House 
Journal, at 1318 ("This bill is in response to a Hawaii Supreme 
Court decision that a taxpayer is not required to serve the 
Director of Taxation with a notice of appeal."). 
Narmore filed a notice of appeal with the tax appeal 
court, but neglected to serve a copy of the notice of appeal on 
the assessor, as required by Rule 2(a) and HRS § 232-17 (2001). 
Narmore
, 112 Hawai 'i at 73-74, 143 P.3d at 1275-76. The Hawai 'i 
Supreme Court held that the requirement to file a copy of the notice of appeal with the assessor was directory, not mandatory, 
and, thus, even if the taxpayer neglected to file a copy with the 
assessor, the tax appeal court still had jurisdiction. Id. at 71 
& 82-83, 143 P.3d at 1273 & 1284-85.

 HB 1256, HD1, SD1, A Bill for an Act Relating to the Perfection of
Appeals to the Tax Appeal Court, was signed into law as Act 154, effective
June 8, 2007.

 In Narmore, the parties "appear[ed] to agree that the . . . Director 
of the Department of Taxation, State of Hawai' i . . . [was] the "assessor" for
purposes of HRS § 232-17 . . . . The parties likewise appear[ed] to agree thatthe [Director] is the assessor for purposes of RTAC Rule 2(a)." Narmore, 112 
Hawai'i at 71, n.4, 143 P.3d at 1273, n.4.

   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Although the supreme court noted that the "filing of a 
notice of appeal is mandatory for purposes of perfecting an 
appeal," it concluded that because "HRS § 232-17 [was] silent on 
the consequences of failing to file a copy of the notice of 
appeal in the assessor's office," Narmore, 112 Hawai 'i at 82, 143 
P.3d at 1284, the filing of the notice was merely directory, not mandatory, and such failure to file with the assessor's office 
did not divest the tax appeal court of jurisdiction. Id. at 82­
83, 143 P.3d at 1284-85. 
House Bill 1256 was introduced in the 2007 legislative
 
session in part to address substantial rights of the State. See
 
H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 565, in 2007 House Journal, at 1318
 
("Your Committee finds that the absence of such timely
 
notification may adversely affect the State's due process
 
rights."). In the final legislative committee report, the
 
legislature noted that "[t]he purpose of this measure is to
 
clarify that the notice of an appeal to the Tax Appeal Court must
 
4
be served on the Director of Taxation  . . . to properly confer
jurisdiction over the appeal." 
S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1551, in
 
2007 Senate Journal, at 1701.
 
The final draft, House Bill 1256, HD1, SD1, amended HRS
 
§ 232-17 to provide in relevant part:
 
An appeal to the tax appeal court is properly commenced by
the filing . . . of a written notice of appeal in the office
of the tax appeal court within thirty days after the filing
of the decision of the state board of review, . . . and
service of the notice of appeal on the director of
taxation[.] 
. . . .
 
An appeal shall be deemed to have been taken in time,
and properly commenced, if the notice thereof . . . and the
copy or copies of the notice shall have been deposited in
the mail, postage prepaid, properly addressed to the tax

 The term "Director of Taxation" was added to HRS § 232-17, replacing
the term "assessor." S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1075, in 2007 Senate Journal,
at 1512-13.

appeal court [and] director of taxation . . . within the
time period provided by this section. 
2007 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 154, § 2 at 287-88.
 
The Director contends that notwithstanding the language
 
of Rule 2(a), substantive changes made to HRS § 232-17 during the
 
2007 legislative session established that to confer jurisdiction
 
over a tax appeal, a taxpayer must serve the Director with the
 
notice of appeal.
 
We agree. According to the plain language of the
 
amended statute, a taxpayer must file a notice of appeal in the
 
tax appeal court and serve the Director with the notice of appeal
 
to properly confer jurisdiction. Therefore, service of notice on
 
the Director is now mandatory and jurisdictional, and the holding
 
in Narmore no longer controls. 
The Areggers also argue that "[t]he Judiciary says what 
the law is" and, because Rule 2(a) was not changed after the 2007 
amendments, the Judiciary intended for the rules to "remain the 
same" and service on the Director is not jurisdictional, 
amendments notwithstanding. The Areggers are correct in noting 
that the language in Rule 2 no longer aligns with the statute. 
See RTAC Rule 2(a). However, where there is a conflict between a 
court rule and a statute, the statute is controlling. In re Doe 
Children, 94 Hawai 'i 485, 486, 17 P.3d 217, 218 (2001). Article 
VI, § 7 of the Hawai 'i Constitution provides that "[t]he supreme 
court shall have power to promulgate rules and regulations in all civil and criminal cases for all courts relating to process, 
practice, procedure and appeals, which shall have the force and 
effect of law." However, pursuant to HRS § 602-11 (1993), 
"[s]uch rules shall not abridge, enlarge, or modify the 
substantive rights of any litigant, nor the jurisdiction of any 
of the courts, nor affect any statute of limitations."

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The tax appeal court did not err when it granted the
 
Director's Motion to Dismiss for lack of subject matter
 
jurisdiction because the Areggers' Notice of Appeal was not
 
timely served on the Director.
 
III.
 
The "Order Granting Appellee Director of Taxation,
 
State of Hawaii's Motion to Dismiss (Filed April 21, 2009)" filed
 
on August 26, 2009 in the Tax Appeal Court is affirmed.
