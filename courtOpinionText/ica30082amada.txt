the following sentence is added: "From our 
sua sponte review, we

Dr. Yim asserted that the circuit court did not have
 
jurisdiction because Ralston's claim was not submitted for review
to the Medical Claims Conciliation Panel (MCCP) under Hawaii
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 671-1 (1993 Repl.) and § 671-12 (1993
Repl.). The circuit court denied Dr. Yim's motion in this regard

and this ruling has not been appealed. From our sua sponte 
review, we determine that there is jurisdiction. See Williams v. 
Aona, 121 Hawai »i 1, 8, 210 P.3d 501, 508 (2009). 
The Clerk of the Court is directed to take all
 
necessary steps to notify the publishing agency of the
 
amendments.
 
An Amended Opinion of the Court will be filed
 
contemporaneously with this order.
