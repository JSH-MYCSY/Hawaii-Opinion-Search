NO. 30090
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAIf I 
MARIANO V. HERNANDO, Plaintiff-Appellant, v. DEPARTMENT OF
EDUCATION, DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT, and MERIT
APPEALS BOARD, Defendants-Appellees
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 07-1-1015)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
On September 29, 2009, Plaintiff-Appellant Mariano V.
 
Hernando (Hernando) appealed a total of nine judgments and orders
 
issued by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court)1
 
in favor of Defendants-Appellees Department of Education (DOE),
 Department of Human Resources Development (DHRD), and Merit
 
Appeals Board (MAB) (collectively, "Appellees"), arising from a
 
civil lawsuit in which Hernando alleged various constitutional
 
and statutory violations after DOE rejected Hernando's
 
application for employment and declined to re-interview him for a
 
sixth time for the same position within a three-year span.
 
On February 10, 2010, this court dismissed the case for
 
lack of jurisdiction except as to Hernando's appeal from the
 
circuit court's October 1, 2009 post-judgment "Order Denying
 
Plaintiff's Motion for an Order Compelling Defendants to File

Answers to Plaintiff's First Request for Admissions Served on
 
Defendants on June 4, 2009 or, in the Alternative, that Documents
 
Be Deemed as Genuine and Statement Admitted as True, and Order
 
Denying Defendants Department of Education and Department of
 
Human Resources Development's Request for Attorneys' Fees and
 
Costs." Hernando v. Department of Educ., et al., No. 30090, 2010
 
WL 541686, at *1 (Haw. Ct. App. Feb. 10, 2010). This court
 explained that Hernando failed to timely appeal the two judgments
 
that resolved all of the claims against the parties, id. at *2,
 
and determined that the circuit court's post-judgment order
 
denying Hernando's motion for a determination of finality was
 
superfluous because final judgment had already been entered. Id.
 
at *3. Accordingly, this court concluded that the only issue
 remaining before it is whether the circuit court erred in denying
 
Hernando's motion to compel Appellees to respond to his
 
post-judgment admissions request. Id. at *4.
 
As a preliminary matter, this court has "an independent
 
obligation to ensure jurisdiction over each case and to dismiss
 
the appeal sua sponte if a jurisdictional defect exits." State
 
v. Graybeard, 93 Hawaif i 513, 516, 6 P.3d 385, 388 (App. 2000). 
Subject to certain exceptions that do not apply in this case, 
appellate courts do not decide moot questions, see Wong v. Bd. of 
Regents, 62 Haw. 391, 394-95, 616 P.2d 201, 204 (1980), and "the 
suit must remain alive throughout the course of litigation to the 
moment of final appellate disposition to escape the mootness 
bar." Kona Old Hawaiian Trails Group v. Lyman, 69 Haw. 81, 87, 
734 P.2d 161, 165 (1987) (internal quotation marks and citation 
omitted). In Wong, the Hawaif i Supreme Court explained that 
"[m]erely abstract or moot questions will not be determined on 
appeal" because the duty of the courts "is to decide actual 
controversies by a judgment which can be carried into effect, and 
not to give opinions upon moot questions or abstract 
propositions, or to declare principles or rules of law which 
cannot affect the matter in issue in the case before it." 62 
Haw. at 394-95, 616 P.2d at 204 (citing Anderson v. Rawley Co.,

27 Haw. 150, 152 (1923); Territory v. Damon, 44 Haw. 557, 562, 
356 P.2d 386, 390 (1960)). The Hawaif i Supreme Court continued, 
"Courts will not consume time deciding abstract propositions of law or moot cases, and have no jurisdiction to do so." Id. at 
395, 616 P.2d at 204 (citing Territory v. Aldridge, 35 Haw. 565, 
567-68 (1940)). 
"A case is moot if it has lost its character as a
 
present, live controversy of the kind that must exist if courts
 
are to avoid advisory opinions on abstract propositions of law." 
Kona Old Hawaiian Trails Group, 69 Haw. at 87, 734 P.2d at 165
 
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In its essence, 
"[a] case is moot if the reviewing court can no longer grant
 
effective relief." City Bank v. Saje Ventures II, 7 Haw. App.
 
130, 134, 748 P.2d 812, 815 (1988) (quoting United States v.
 Oregon, 718 F.2d 299, 302 (9th Cir. 1983)) (internal quotation
 
marks omitted).
 
Applying these principles, this court concludes that
 
Hernando's appeal from the circuit court's post-judgment denial
 
of his motion to compel does not present a live issue and,
 
therefore, this court does not have jurisdiction to hear it. 
Hernando's discovery request goes to the substantive merits of
 
the case, but the merits of the case have already been determined
 
by the circuit court's summary judgment orders and final entry of
 
judgment in favor of Appellees. As this court already has
 
explained, it does not have jurisdiction to review these
 
judgments because Hernando did not timely appeal the circuit
 
court's orders and judgments. See Hernando, 2010 WL 541686, at
 
*2, *4. Given that Hernando's discovery request goes to the
 
underlying substantive merits of the case and this court cannot
 
review the merits of the case, there is no value to the discovery
 
Hernando seeks and this court cannot offer Hernando any
 
meaningful relief. See Kona Old Hawaiian Trails Group, 69 Haw.
 
at 87, 734 P.2d at 165. Thus, the discovery issue is now moot.

In Willis v. Swain, 126 Hawaif i 312, 270 P.3d 1042 
(App. 2012), this court applied the same principles to affirm a 
circuit court's denial of a plaintiff's motion to compel 
discovery relevant to her bad faith claim against the defendant 
because the plaintiff did not have a cognizable claim for bad 
faith against the defendant. 126 Hawaif i at 317, 270 P.3d at 
1047. As illustrated by the order from Linkous v. Lane, 276 
S.W.3d 917 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2008), which was cited by Appellees, 
courts in other jurisdictions also have held that discovery 
requests are rendered moot by a final disposition of the case on 
its merits. See, e.g., Barthelemy v. Air Lines Pilots Ass'n, 897 
F.2d 999, 1011 (9th Cir. 1990) (explaining that discovery 
requests are moot when an order granting summary judgment is 
affirmed on the basis that the plaintiff's complaint does not 
state a claim for which relief can be granted); Larson v. Iboshi, 
441 Fed. Appx. 511, 514 (9th Cir. 2011) ("Larson's second motion 
to compel discovery was rendered moot by the courtâ€™s dismissal 
with prejudice of Larson's complaint."); In re City of El Paso, 
Texas, 887 F.2d 1103, 1105-06 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (holding that 
certain discovery subpoenas were rendered moot when there was no 
trial in which the discovery could be used); see also, Butler v. 
Douglas County, 457 Fed. Appx. 674, 676 (9th Cir. 2011) ("Having 
affirmed summary judgment, any discovery violations are moot."). 
Therefore, appellate court case number 30090 is
 
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
