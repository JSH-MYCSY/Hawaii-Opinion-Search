STATE OF HAWAI» I, Plaintiff-Appellee,  v.
ERIN A. RUTTENBER, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
WAILUKU DIVISION
 
(Case No. 2DTC-09-008131)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Erin A. Ruttenber (Ruttenber) appeals
 
the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment
 
filed on September 2, 2009 in the District Court of the Second
 
Circuit, Wailuku Division (district court).1
 
Ruttenber was convicted of Excessive Speeding, in
 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes § 291C-105(a)(1) (2007 Repl.). 
On appeal, Ruttenber contends that the district court
 
"erred in admitting the alleged speed and distance readings"
 
without adequate foundation2 that "the laser gun had been tested
 
according to manufacturer's recommended procedures and/or that
 
Officer [Jamie] Wright [(Officer Wright)] was qualified by training
and experience to operate the laser speed gun."

 The Honorable Kelsey Kawano presided.

 Ruttenber did not object to the accuracy of the laser during testimony,
but did move for judgment of acquittal later at the close of the State's case as
to whether the laser met "accepted standards for accuracy" and "whether [Officer
Wright] was qualified to determine whether it was accurate", and did renew the
objection after both parties rested.

The State concedes that the State failed to lay
 
sufficient foundation for admission of the laser gun speed reading
 
and requests that the conviction be reversed.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the
 
arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve
 
Ruttenber's point of error as follows:
 
In this case, the record is sufficient to review
 
Ruttenber's point of error that the State failed to adduce
 
sufficient evidence that the laser gun was tested according to the
 
manufacturer's recommended procedures or that Officer Wright was
 
qualified to operate the laser in order to establish sufficient
 
foundation for the laser gun reading.
 
The only evidence presented in this case was the 
testimony of Officer Wright. Officer Wright did not testify that 
the laser gun was tested in accordance with the manufacturer's 
specifications or that he was qualified by training and experience 
to operate the laser gun. Therefore, the State failed to adduce 
sufficient evidence regarding the accuracy of the laser gun, and 
the laser gun reading should not have been admitted as evidence. 
State v. Assaye , 121 Hawai» i 204, 210-14, 216 P.3d 1227, 1233-37 
(2009).  Without evidence of the laser gun reading, there is 
insufficient evidence to convict Ruttenber of Excessive Speeding. 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the Notice of Entry of Judgment
 
and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, filed on September 2, 2009 in the
 
District Court of the Second Circuit, Wailuku Division, is
 
reversed.
