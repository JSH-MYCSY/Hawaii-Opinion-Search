SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Eric Lighter (Lighter) appeals from 
the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 54(b) Judgment1 
(Judgment) filed on September 14, 2009 in the Circuit Court of 
the Second Circuit (circuit court).2 The circuit court entered 
judgment in favor of Plaintiffs-Appellees Dwayne N. Betsill; Janet R. Betsill; Randall Betsill; Doyle G. Betsill, 
Individually, and as Co-Trustee of The Doyle G. Betsill, Jr. 
Trust dated July 28, 2006, as amended and restated, and as 
Co-Trustee of The J. Lee Guthrie Trust dated July 28, 2006, as 
amended and restated; J. Lee Guthrie, Co-Trustee of The Doyle G. 
Betsill, Jr. Trust dated July 28, 2006, as amended and restated, 
and Co-Trustee of The J. Lee Guthrie Trust dated July 28, 2006, 
as amended and restated; Matthew LLC, a Hawaii limited liability 
company; RDD LLC, a Hawaii limited liability company; Koolau 
Cattle Company LLC (Koolau Cattle), a Hawaii limited liability 
company; Betsill Brothers Construction, Inc., a Hawaii 
corporation; Wright & Kirschbraun, a Hawaii limited liability law 
company (W&K); and Deborah K. Wright (Wright) (collectively, 
Plaintiffs) and against Defendant-Appellees Mahealani 
Ventura-Oliver (Ventura-Oliver), Individually, as Trustee of the 
Irrevocable Trust of Alexander M. Birch, and as the Attorney-in-
Fact for Gilbert Schmitt; Oliver Dukelow (Dukelow); John D. 
Oliver (Oliver); Juanita Leimomi Schmitt (J. Schmitt); Gilbert 
Schmitt (G. Schmitt); Princess Ruth Keelikolani Perpetuity Trust; 
Mahinapiha O Hoku E. Ventura; Rona Lee K. Ventura; Alii Pu O Lani

 Lighter also appeals from several interlocutory orders, but only the
final Judgment gives this court jurisdiction in this case. Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1(a) (Supp. 2010); HRCP Rules 54(b) & 58; and Jenkins v.Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338
(1994). However, "[a]n appeal from a final judgment brings up for review allinterlocutory orders not appealable directly as of right which deal withissues in the case." Ueoka v. Szymanski, 107 Hawai' i 386, 396, 114 P.3d 892,
902 (2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).

Credit Bureau, Inc. (DCBI); and Lighter  (collectively,
Defendants) as to all of Plaintiffs' claims.
 
It is difficult to discern Lighter's points on appeal 
because his opening brief falls far short of the requirements of 
Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b). Lighter 
fails to provide a concise statement of the points of error and generally fails to note "the alleged error committed by the 
court," "where in the record the alleged error[s] occurred," and 
"where in the record the alleged error[s were] objected to or 
. . . brought to the attention of the court." HRAP Rule 
28(b)(4)(i)-(iii). Without providing any citations to the 
record, Lighter lists nine purported points of error at the 
beginning of his brief. Twenty-two pages later, he lists twelve 
"Material Issues of Fact in Dispute and Points of Error," five of 
which appear to be intended as additional points of error and 
some of which repeat points of error listed on the first page of 
his opening brief. Again, Lighter provides no citations to the 
record. 
Lighter provides an extensive recounting of his version
 
of Hawaiian history as it relates to the ownership of the
 
property at issue. Much of Lighter's "Saga Restated" (his
 
heading) contains supposed facts with few record references. 
Lighter appears to be providing this detailed genealogy and
 
history of property distribution to support his proposition that
 
the legal ownership of the property is in dispute. However, the
 
question of title was resolved in 2003 in a quiet title action,
 
Mahealani Ventura-Oliver v. Wailuku Agribusiness Co., et al.,
 
Civil No. 03-1-0186(3) (Ventura-Oliver v. Wailuku Agribusiness),
 
in the circuit court.

 Although the first paragraph of the Judgment fails to list DCBI and
Lighter as Defendants against whom judgment has been entered, the Judgment
awards specific damages against DCBI and Lighter, and the final paragraph of
the Judgment states that "Judgment is entered in favor of Plaintiffs and
against all Defendants as to all of Plaintiffs' claims in this action."

Lighter's further noncompliance with Rule 28(b)
 
includes his failure to attach to his opening brief copies of the
 
Judgment and orders from which he is appealing. Plaintiffs
 
pointed out this error in their answering brief, and Lighter
 
attached the missing items to his reply brief.
 
Plaintiffs argue that because Lighter did not provide a
 
copy of the transcript of the July 14, 2009 hearing on summary
 
judgment that resulted in the Judgment and orders before us, this
 
court lacks sufficient basis to review the circuit court's
 
orders. We note that although a transcript was not requested, a
 
full copy of the transcript is available in the record on appeal. 
Therefore, we are able to review the transcript as needed.
 
Because of Lighter's failure to comply with HRAP Rule 
28(b), this court could refuse to consider his appeal as a 
sanction for his noncompliance. HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) ("Points not 
presented in accordance with this section will be disregarded, 
except that the appellate court, at its option, may notice a 
plain error not presented."); Housing Finance & Dev. Corp. v. 
Ferguson, 91 Hawai' i 81, 85-86, 979 P.2d 1107, 1111-12 (1999) 
(such noncompliance is grounds for dismissal). However, recognizing the Hawai' i Supreme Court's policy to have appeals 
heard on their merits where possible, Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai' i 225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 558 (1995), we have reviewed 
Lighter's appeal on its merits, of which we find none. 
As best we can discern, Lighter's relevant points on
 
appeal are as follows:
 
(1) The circuit court erred in granting summary
 
judgment because title to the disputed property is an open
 question. Also, the circuit court erred when it determined that
 
Lighter and DCBI were in privity with the other defendants,
 
precluding Lighter from raising the issue of title under the
 
doctrine of res judicata.
 
(2) The circuit court abused its discretion when it
 
denied Lighter's Motion for Reconsideration because the circuit

court should have found that Plaintiffs had not complied with the 
requirements under the Rules of the Circuit Courts of the State 
of Hawai' i (HRCC) Rule 23 for filing their proposed orders, 
Lighter and DCBI had already released the property liens, and the summary judgment exceeded the scope of the circuit court's oral 
orders. 
(3) Plaintiffs were required under HRS ยง 507D-4 (2006
 
Repl.) to give Lighter notice before filing the Complaint.
 
(4) Plaintiffs' claims were subject to HRS ยง 657-7
 
(1993), which sets forth a two-year statute of limitations for
 
suits for damage to persons or property.
 
(5) The circuit court abused its discretion in not
 
finding a conflict of interest between Wright and W&K (counsel
 
for Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs themselves) and the remainder of
 
the Plaintiffs.
 
(6) The circuit court abused its discretion when it
 
awarded attorney's fees, costs, and damages to Plaintiffs.
 
None of these points have any merit whatsoever. 
Lighter makes other allegations of error, but he failed to raise
 
such allegations below or argue them on appeal, or such
 
allegations are equally without merit.
 
Therefore, 
The Judgment filed on September 14, 2009 in the Circuit 
Court of the Second Circuit is affirmed.
