appeals from two interlocutory orders, entered on September 17,
 
2009, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court),
 
denying Alangcas's motions to dismiss Counts I and III of
 
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawaii's (State) indictment against

 The Honorable Glenn J. Kim presided.
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal, Alangcas maintains that the Circuit Court
 
erred in denying his motions to dismiss the indictment on the
 
grounds that HRS § 707-756 is unconstitutionally vague and
 overbroad, and that it violates the "dormant" Commerce Clause of
 the United States Constitution. We affirm.
 I. BACKGROUND
 
On March 5, 2009, the State obtained an indictment
 
against Alangcas for two counts of electronic enticement of a
 child in the first degree in violation of HRS § 707-756 (Counts I
 
and III), and two counts of attempted promoting pornography for
 minors in violation of HRS § 705-500 (1993) and HRS § 712-1215
 
(1993 & Supp. 2012) (Counts II and IV).

The charges arose from Alangcas's alleged improper
 
electronic communications with police officers Andrew Brito and
 Sandi Fujitani, both posing as females under the age of eighteen,
 known respectively as "kaplma_girl" or "Heather Cabico" and
 "shoyubunnie" or "Shanna Lee." Regarding Counts I and III, the
 indictment alleged that while communicating with the police
 officers, Alangcas agreed to meet "Heather" and "Shanna" with the
 "intent to promote or facilitate the commission of a felony that
 is an offense defined in [HRS] Section 846E-1" and then
 "intentionally or knowingly travel[ed] to the agreed upon meeting
 place at the agreed upon meeting time." Alangcas is alleged to
 have started communicating with the "minors" on August 29, 2008,
 and he subsequently arranged two different meetings with them: 
one at a Starbucks on September 3, 2008; and one at a McDonalds

 Counts II and IV are not at issue on this appeal.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
on March 3, 2009. Immediately following the attempted meeting at
 
McDonald's, Alangcas was apprehended and arrested.
 
On July 13, 2009, Alangcas filed two separate motions
 
to dismiss the indictment. In the first motion, Alangcas argued
 that HRS § 707-756 was unconstitutional because the statute
 violates the dormant Commerce Clause of the United States
 Constitution. In the second motion, Alangcas argued that HRS
 § 707-756 is unconstitutionally vague and/or overbroad.
 
On September 2, 2009, the Circuit Court conducted a
 
hearing on both motions. On September 17, 2009, the Circuit
 Court entered orders denying Alangcas's motions to dismiss. On
 September 28, 2009, Alangcas filed a motion for leave to assert
 an interlocutory appeal from the September 17, 2009 orders,
 pursuant to HRS § 641-17 (Supp. 2012), which was granted. 
Algancas timely filed a notice of appeal.
 II.	 POINTS OF ERROR ON APPEAL
 
Alangcas raises the following points of error:
 (1) the Circuit Court erred in determining that HRS
 
§ 707-756 does not violate constitutional prohibitions against
 vague and overbroad regulations; and
 
(2) the Circuit Court erred in determining that
 
HRS § 707-756 does not violate Article I, Section 8 of the United
 States Constitution.
 III. APPLICABLE STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
The appellate court reviews questions of constitutional
 
law de novo under the 'right/wrong' standard. See, e.g., State
 
v. Fields, 115 Hawai
'i 503, 511, 168 P.3d 955, 963 (2007). Every 
3
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
duly-enacted statute is presumptively constitutional, and the
 
party challenging the statute must carry a heavy burden to
 overcome this presumption. State v. Gaylord, 78 Hawai
'i 127, 
137, 890 P.2d 1167, 1177 (1995). Whenever possible, a penal
 statute will be read narrowly and in such a manner as to preserve
 the statute's constitutionality. Id. at 137-38, 890 P.2d at
 
1177-78.
 IV. DISCUSSION
 A. The Prohibition Against Vague and Overbroad Laws
 The Hawaii Supreme Court has adopted the following 
conceptual approach to constitutional challenges to penal
 statutes on vagueness grounds:
 
'
[T]his court has treated claims that a criminal
statute is unconstitutionally vague as essentially facial
attacks, subject to the following standard: Due process of
law requires that a penal statute state with reasonable
clarity the act it proscribes and provide fixed standards
for adjudging guilt, or the statute is void for vagueness.
Statutes must give the person of ordinary intelligence a
reasonable opportunity to know what conduct is prohibited so
that he or she may choose between lawful and unlawful
conduct.
 
This standard is essentially indistinguishable from
the applicable standard under federal law. Thus we have so
far not departed from federal constitutional law in the area
of "void for vagueness" challenges to criminal statutes.
Under the applicable federal law, a criminal statute is void
for vagueness unless it: (1) gives the person of ordinary
intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is
prohibited so that he or she may act accordingly; and (2)
provides explicit standards for those who apply the statute,
in order to avoid arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement
and the delegation of basic policy matters to policemen,
judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and
subjective basis.
 
Gaylord, 78 Hawai 'i at 138, 890 P.2d at 1178 (citations, 
brackets, internal quotation marks, and ellipsis omitted; format
 
altered); see also State v. Beltran, 116 Hawai 'i 146, 151, 172 
P.3d 458, 463 (2007). Thus, the Due Process Clause of the
 Fourteenth Amendment requires that a criminal statute: (1) give
 
4
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to
 
know what is prohibited; and (2) provide explicit standards that
 do not encourage arbitrary enforcement. 
The supreme court has articulated the relationship
 
between the void-for-vagueness doctrine and the doctrine of
 overbreadth as follows:
 
The doctrine of overbreadth, although closely related
to a vagueness claim, is distinct in that while a statute
may be clear and precise in its terms, it may sweep so
broadly that constitutionally protected conduct as well as
unprotected conduct is included in its proscriptions.
  
State v. Kaneakua,  61 Haw. 136, 143, 597 P.2d 590, 594 (1979)
 
(citations omitted). Therefore, in order to determine whether a
 
statute is overbroad, we must consider whether it reaches a
 substantial amount of constitutionally-protected conduct. See
 
Beltran, 116 Hawai
'i at 152, 172 P.3d at 464. 
The statute at issue here, HRS § 707-756, provides in
 
relevant part:
 
§ 707-756 Electronic enticement of a child in the
first degree.  (1) Any person who, using a computer or any
other electronic device:
 
(a) Intentionally or knowingly communicates: 
(i)	 With a minor known by the person to
be under the age of eighteen years;
(ii)	 
With another person, in reckless disregard
of the risk that the other person is under
the age of eighteen years, and the other
person is under the age of eighteen years;
or 
(iii) With another person who represents
that person to be under the age of
eighteen years; 
(b)	 With the intent to promote or facilitate
the commission of a felony:
 
(i)	 That is a murder in the first or
 
second degree;
(ii)	 That is a class A felony; or
(iii) That is another covered offense as
defined in section 846E-1, 
5
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
agrees to meet with the minor, or
with another person who represents
that person to be a minor under the
age of eighteen years; and
 
(c)	 Intentionally or knowingly travels to the
agreed upon meeting place at the agreed
upon meeting time, 
is guilty of electronic enticement of a child in the first
degree.
 
HRS § 707-756(1) (Supp. 2012).
 
Alangcas argues that HRS § 707-756 is
 
unconstitutionally overbroad and/or vague because it: (1)
 
unnecessarily ensnares constitutionally-protected conduct; (2)
 overbroadly criminalizes mere thoughts without providing adequate
 safeguards; (3) does not require actual intent to commit a crime;
 (4) subjects criminal liability to the minors it seeks to
 protect; (5) attempts to ensnare offenses which are impossible to
 commit; (6) refers to a confusing labyrinth of language that
 results in guesswork and differences of opinion; and (7) would
 subject citizens to arrest and prosecution based on the
 moment-to-moment opinions of police officers. We consider each
 of these arguments in turn.
 
First, Alangcas argues that HRS § 707-756(1) broadly
 
ensnares common and legitimate daily behavior by anyone who has a
 family member, relative, family friend, colleague, student,
 parishioner, employee, or customer under the age of 18 because
 the actus reus prohibitions are: (1) use a computer or other
 electronic device to communicate with a person known or claiming
 to be under 18, or in reckless disregard that the person is under
 18; (2) agree to meet that person; and (3) travel to the agreed
 upon meeting place at the agreed time. In making this argument,
 
6
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Alangcas ignores the language in subsection (b) of the statute
 
that requires that these otherwise "innocent" acts be done with
 the intent to promote or facilitate the commission of certain,
 specified, felonies. See HRS § 707-756(1)(b). When the statute
 
is read as a whole, it is clear that only criminal conduct is
 proscribed.
 
Second, Alangcas argues that the statute criminalizes
 
"mere thoughts" without adequate safeguards. Alangcas argues, in
 part, that the mens rea is overbroad because it fails to apply
 the criminal intent – the intent to promote or facilitate the
 commission of a specified felony – to all of the actus reas
 elements in the statute. However, Alangcas erroneously reads the
 statute's three subsections individually, rather than
 collectively, and ignores the distinct mens rea required for
 each: (1) intentionally or knowingly communicate with a minor
 (or in reckless disregard of risk that the person is a minor or
 with a person claiming to be a minor) (HRS § 707­756(1)(a)); (2) with the intent to promote or facilitate the
 commission of a specified felony, agree to meet with that person
 (HRS § 707-756(1)(b)); and (3) intentionally or knowingly travel
 
to the agreed upon meeting place at the agreed upon time (HRS
 
§ 707-756(1)(c)). All three mens rea requirements must be met,
 and, because the statute requires all three paragraphs of the
 statute to be read together, only behavior done with the
 requisite criminal intent is proscribed, i.e., conduct that
 occurs with the intent to promote or facilitate the commission of
 a felony. We agree with Alangcas that intentionally or knowingly
 
7
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
communicating with a minor is not a crime. However, doing so,
 
and agreeing to meet with the minor with the intent to promote or
 facilitate the commission of a specified felony, and
 intentionally or knowingly proceeding to the meeting place at the
 specified time, sufficiently identifies the mens rea for each of
 the acts which together constitute the criminal offense. Such a
 prohibition does not broadly sweep in innocent electronic
 communications with minors.
 
Alangcas contends that the overbroad mens rea scheme in
 
HRS § 707-756 widens the door for abuse, in particular,
 entrapment and enticement of a defendant by law enforcement
 officers and false allegations by disgruntled complainants, and
 effectively precludes any renunciation of intent to complete the
 crime.
3 However, Alangcas fails to explain or support his
 
argument that the possibility of entrapment or false accusations
 renders a statute unconstitutional. The evidence has not yet
 been developed in this case, and Alangcas is or may be entitled
 to raise an affirmative defense of entrapment, pursuant to HRS §
 702-237 (1993), and/or renunciation, pursuant to HRS § 705-530
 (1993). As in most cases, the trier-of-fact will have to
 determine the truth or falsity of the complainant's accusations. 
3
 With this argument, Alangcas also argues that HRS § 707-756 was
passed in order to prevent defendants from exercising their statutory and
constitutional rights in their defense to the charge of attempted sexual
assault. This argument is unavailing. The legislative history plainly
indicates the legislative intent to create a distinct crime: "Current laws do
 not specifically address using computers to communicate with minors for the
purposes of committing crime." S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 2867, in 2002 Senate
Journal, at 1384. The purpose of the statute was not to circumvent the
attempt statute, but to "criminalize the sex offender's predatory computer
behavior, so that the offender can be prosecuted for what the offender has
actually done, as opposed to what the offender may have been trying to do."
Id.
 
8
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
With respect to unconstitutional vagueness or overbreadth, these
 
arguments are without merit.
 
Third, Alangcas argues that HRS § 707-756 does not
 
require actual intent to commit a crime. We disagree. As
 discussed above, the statute plainly criminalizes conduct
 (described above) that is coupled with the intent to promote or
 facilitate the commission of a felony. See HRS § 707-756(1)
 
(Supp. 2012). 
Fourth, Alangcas argues that HRS § 707-756 is so vague 
and overbroad that it improperly subjects minors to criminal liability. However, we need not address this claim because "[a] person to whom a statute may be constitutionally applied cannot challenge the statute on the ground that it may conceivably be applied unconstitutionally to others." Beltran, 116 Hawai
'i at 
150, 172 P.3d at 462 (citations omitted). Consistent with traditional rules of standing, "[c]onstitutional rights may not be asserted vicariously." State v. Bereday, 120 Hawai
'i 486, 
498, 210 P.3d 9, 21 (App. 2009) (citation omitted). "Courts are not to anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it." State v. Marley, 54 Haw. 450, 
457, 509 P.2d 1095, 1101 (1973) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
Fifth, Alangcas argues that HRS § 707-756 is so vague
 
and overbroad that it attempts to ensnare offenses in HRS § 846E­1 which are impossible to commit. As an example, Alangcas argues 
9
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
4We presume that Alangcas's reference to HRS § 707-732(1)(c) was
intended to reference HRS § 707-732(1)(a), which provides:
§ 707-732  Sexual assault in the third degree.  (1) A
person commits the offense of sexual assault in the third
degree if:
(a)The person recklessly subjects another person to
an act of sexual penetration by compulsion;
5HRS § 707-756(1)(b) states (emphasis added):
(b)With the intent to promote or facilitate
the commission of a felony:
 
(i)That is a murder in the first or
second degree; 
(ii)That is a class A felony; or 
(iii)That is another covered offense as
defined in section 846E-1, 
agrees to meet with the minor, or with another
person who represents that person to be a minor
under the age of eighteen years; . . . 
HRS § 846E-1 (Supp. 2012) includes the following definitions of
"covered offense" and the terms used in the definition of a covered offense:
"Covered offense" means a criminal offense that is:
(1)A crime within the definition of "crimes against
minors" in this section; or
(2)A crime within the definition of "sexual
offense" in this section.
 
"Crime against minors" excludes "sexual offenses" as
defined in this section and means a criminal offense that
consists of:
(1)Kidnapping of a minor, by someone other than a
parent;
(2)Unlawful imprisonment in the first or second
degree that involves the unlawful imprisonment
of a minor by someone other than a parent;
(3) An act, as described in chapter 705, that is an
attempt, criminal solicitation, or criminal
conspiracy to commit one of the offenses
designated in paragraph (1) or (2); or
(4) A criminal offense that is comparable to or
which exceeds one of the offenses designated in
paragraphs (1) through (3) or any federal,
military, or out-of-state conviction for any
offense that, under the laws of this State would
be a crime against minors as designated in
paragraphs (1) through (3).

paragraphs (1) through (4); or
(6)An act, as described in chapter 705, that is an
attempt, criminal solicitation, or criminal
conspiracy to commit one of the offenses

Except as otherwise expressly noted, this Opinion references the
Hawaii Revised Statutes 2012 Supplement versions of both HRS §§ 707-756 and
846E-1.  Through the date of this Opinion, there have been no changes to HRS
§ 707-756 since May 16, 2008, which is prior to the alleged criminal conduct
in this case.  HRS § 846E-1, however, has been subject to numerous revisions
during that period, which revisions are all minor and/or not relevant to the
constitutional challenges raised in this appeal.  See 2013 Haw. Sess. Laws Act
247, § 5 at 746-47 (effective July 1, 2013); 2013 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 64, § 3,
4 at 114-16 (effective Apr. 30, 2013); 2011 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 125, § 1 at
327-28 (effective July 1, 2011); 2009 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 11, § 10 at 17
(continued...)
11 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Alangcas has not presented any argument the he, himself, has been 
charged in connection with an impossible-to-commit offense. The indictment merely identifies the underlying offense as a felony "that is an offense defined in [HRS] Section 846E-1."  At this 
stage in the proceedings, the prosecution has not explicitly 
stated, nor is required to state, which specific offense in HRS § 846E-1 comprises Alangcas's charge. See State v. Nicholson, 120 
Hawai
'i 480, 485, 210 P.3d 3, 8 (App. 2009) (rejecting 
defendant's claim that the indictment for HRS § 707-756 failed to adequately state an offense because it did not specify which offense defined in HRS § 846E-1 the defendant intended to commit). Indeed, the only issues raised in this interlocutory appeal involve the constitutionality of the statute, not the sufficiency of the charge. 
Moreover, HRS § 707-756 does not seek to criminalize an
 
"attempt" to commit another offense. It criminalizes predatory
 behavior through the use of computers or other electronic
 devices. As discussed above, the statute clearly describes the
 actions, attendant circumstances, and mens rea that constitute
 the violation of law, i.e., (1) intentionally or knowingly
 communicate with a minor (or in reckless disregard of risk that
 the person is a minor or with a person claiming to be a minor)
 (HRS § 707-756(1)(a)); (2) with the intent to promote or
 facilitate the commission of a specified felony, agree to meet
 
5(...continued)
(effective Apr. 21, 2009); 2008 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 80, § 4 at 229-30
(effective Jan. 1, 2009). Therefore, for purposes of simplification and
clarity, the version of HRS § 846E-1 that appears in the 2012 Supplement is
quoted and discussed herein, except as otherwise specifically indicated. 
12
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
with that person (HRS § 707-756(1)(b)); and (3) intentionally or 
knowingly travel to agreed upon meeting place at the agreed upon time (HRS § 707-756(1)(c)). The completion of the specified actions, with the required mens rea under the attendant circumstances constitutes a "complete crime" and not an attempt to commit another offense. Cf. State v. Holbron, 80 Hawai
'i 27, 
34-35, 904 P.2d 912, 919-20 (1995) (discussing the distinction between an attempted criminal act and the complete crime; also discussing the impossibility of an attempt (an intentional act) to commit manslaughter (a crime involving a reckless state of mind)). 
Sixth, Alangcas argues that HRS § 707-756 is void for
 
vagueness because "it refers to a confusing labyrinth of language
 in [HRS] § 846E-1 that results in guesswork and differences in
 opinion." As noted above, the import of the definitions in HRS
 § 846E-1 stems from the incorporation of the definitions into HRS
 § 707-756(1)(b)(iii) (emphasis added):
 
(b)	 With the intent to promote or facilitate the
commission of a felony:
. . . .  
(iii) 
That is another covered offense as defined in
section 846E-1, 
agrees to meet with the minor, or with another person
who represents that person to be a minor under the age
of eighteen years; . . . 
Thus, engaging in the conduct described in HRS § 707­
756, with the intent to promote or facilitate the commission of a 
felony that is a "covered offense" as defined in HRS § 846E-1, constitutes an offense under the electronic enticement statute. HRS Chapter 846E is the Hawai
'i sex offender registration 
13
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
statute, requiring sex offenders and persons convicted of certain
 
crimes against minors to register with the attorney general and
 otherwise comply with the statute's requirements. 
"Covered offense," as defined in HRS § 846E-1, includes
 
crimes against minors and sexual offenses, which are also defined
 in HRS § 846E-1:
 
"Covered offense" means a criminal offense that is:
 
(1)	 A crime within the definition of "crimes against
minors" in this section; or
(2)	 
A crime within the definition of "sexual offense" in this section. 
Crimes against minors and sexual offenses are each 
defined by reference to: (1) a description of an offense – for 
example, "[k]idnapping of a minor, by someone other than a parent"; (2) a Hawai
'i Penal Code section that imposes criminal 
liability for the offense described therein; or (3) a "catchall" provision, as discussed further below. 
See HRS § 846E-1 (which 
is set forth in note 6 above). Alangcas does not provide any further argument, nor do we conclude, that the incorporation of the former two categories (descriptions of the particular offenses and/or references to other Hawai
'i Penal Code sections) 
renders HRS § 706-756 unconstitutionally vague on its face. Instead, Alangcas contends, inter alia, that the catchall provisions leave persons of ordinary intelligence "to guess and no doubt differ in opinion" as to what offenses are included. 
The catchall provisions are set forth in the following 
bolded paragraphs of the HRS § 846E-1 definitions of crime against minors and sexual offense (emphasis added):
 
"Crime against minors" excludes "sexual offenses" as
defined in this section and means a criminal offense
 that consists of:
 
14
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
15(1)Kidnapping of a minor, by someone other than a
parent;
(2)Unlawful imprisonment in the first or second
degree that involves the unlawful imprisonment
of a minor by someone other than a parent;
(3) An act, as described in chapter 705, that is an
attempt, criminal solicitation, or criminal
conspiracy to commit one of the offenses
designated in paragraph (1) or (2); or
(4) A criminal offense that is comparable to or
which exceeds one of the offenses designated in
paragraphs (1) through (3) or any federal,
military, or out-of-state conviction for any
offense that, under the laws of this State would
be a crime against minors as designated in
paragraphs (1) through (3).
And
"Sexual offense" means an offense that is:
(1) Set forth in section . . .;
(2) An act defined in section 707-720 if . . .;
(3) An act that consists of:
(A) Criminal sexual conduct toward a minor,
including . . .;
(B) Solicitation of a minor who is less than
fourteen years old to engage in sexual
conduct;
(C) Use of a minor in a sexual performance;
(D) Production, distribution, or possession of
child pornography chargeable as a felony
under section . . . ;
(E) Electronic enticement of a child
chargeable under section 707-756 or
707-757 if the offense was committed with
the intent to promote or facilitate the
commission of another covered offense as
defined in this section; or
(F) Solicitation of a minor to practice
prostitution;
(4)A violation of privacy under section 711-1110.9;
(5)A criminal offense that is comparable to or that
exceeds a sexual offense as defined in
paragraphs (1) through (4) or any federal,
military, or out-of-state conviction for any
offense that under the laws of this State would
be a sexual offense as defined in paragraphs (1)
through (4); or
(6)An act, as described in chapter 705, that is an
attempt, criminal solicitation, or criminal
conspiracy to commit one of the offenses
designated in paragraphs (1) through (5).
We necessarily construe these catchall provisions in
light of common sense, precedent, and legislative history.  See
Gaylord, 78 Hawai# i at 137, 890 P.2d at 1177.  When doing so, we
must bear in mind the dual roles of these definitions in HRS
Chapter 846E and HRS § 707-756.  But first, we must look at theFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
language of the statute itself. See, e.g., HGEA v. Lingle, 124 
Hawai'i 197, 207 n.16, 239 P.3d 1, 11 n.16 (2010). 
The parallel catchall language in the HRS § 846E-1
 
definitions of crime against minors and sexual offense can be
 
plainly read as having two parts: (1) a criminal offense that is
 "comparable to or exceeds" a crime against minors/sexual offense,
 as such crime against minors/sexual offense is defined in the
 statute; or (2) any federal, military, or out-of-state conviction
 for any offense that under the laws of this State would be a
 crime against minors/sexual offense, as such crime against
 minors/sexual offense is defined in the registration statute. 
HRS § 846E-1. Because the analysis is somewhat simpler, we will
 address the second clause first.
 
In the context of the registration statute (HRS Chapter 
846E), the second clause is plainly and clearly intended to insure that Hawai
'i can keep track of and notify the community of 
the whereabouts of persons who have been convicted elsewhere (in federal, military, or other state court proceedings) of a criminal offense that would constitute a crime against minors or a sexual offense under Hawai
'i law. See State v. Guidry, 105 
Hawai'i 222, 236, 96 P.3d 242, 256 (2004) (stating that 
"registration requirements to protect the public have not 'historically been regarded as a punishment[,]' but as 'valid regulatory technique with a remedial purpose[]'"). In the context of the electronic enticement statute (HRS § 707-756), the second clause is merely redundant. Engaging in the acts specified in HRS § 707-756(1), with the intent to promote or 
16
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
facilitate a felony that would constitute a crime against minors 
or sexual offense under Hawai 'i law, is a violation of Hawai 'i's 
electronic enticement statute, whether or not the intended felony would also constitute a felony under the laws of another jurisdiction. Although the second part of the catchall provision contains some redundancy in its application to HRS § 707-756(1), the criminal prohibition is clear. 
In the context of both crimes against minors and sexual
 
offenses, the first part of the catchall provision includes any
 criminal offense that is "comparable to" or "exceeds" one of the
 specifically-described offenses. There is no constitutionally-
infirm vagueness in the concept of a criminal offense that is
 "comparable to" a described offense. A person of ordinary
 intelligence can easily understand that a comparable offense is
 an equivalent one — one that may be described using slightly
 different words, but that is plainly intended to prohibit the
 same criminal activity. 
The concept of an offense that "exceeds" a
 
specifically-described offense is more problematic. A person of
 ordinary intelligence can perhaps understand that if one offense
 "exceeds" another, it is, in some way, a worse crime. But in
 what way? Does it mean that it involves aggravated circumstances
 or sexually violent behavior, has greater potential criminal
 penalties, and/or otherwise involves generally more reprehensible
 behavior? Does it include offenses that "exceed" but do not
 otherwise fall within the range of offenses defined as crimes
 against minors or sexual offenses? 
17
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Alangcas argues that persons of ordinary intelligence
 
are left to guess and no doubt differ in opinion as to what
 
offenses are comparable to or exceed the offenses mentioned in
 the statute and further argues that such guesswork creates a
 danger of discriminatory enforcement on an ad hoc and subjective
 basis. In response, the State simply argues that the catchall
 provision is "neither unclear nor vague" and "clearly refers to
 crimes in other jurisdictions that would be the equivalent to"
 the crimes identified in the preceding three paragraphs. 
Although we agree with the State's construction with respect to
 "comparable" offenses, the statute lacks any intrinsic
 definition, explanation, or other tools for determining what
 offenses "exceed" the enumerated offenses. Surely it involves
 otherwise criminal conduct, but the statute is wholly lacking in
 specificity. With respect to its incorporation into the
 electronic enticement statute, the definition of an offense that
 "exceeds" other offenses "falls short of due process demands"
 because it "neither gives fair notice to a person what conduct is
 prohibited nor prescribes fixed standards for adjudging guilt
 when that person stands accused." In re Doe, 54 Haw. 647, 650,
 
513 P.2d 1385, 1388 (1973) (citations and internal quotation
 marks omitted) (holding that Honolulu curfew ordinance was
 unconstitutionally vague because, inter alia, the word "wanders"
 was not susceptible to an agreed upon understanding).
 
The legislative history of HRS § 846E-1 also sheds no
 
light on what offenses were intended to fall within the ambit of
 offenses that "exceed" the enumerated covered offenses. When the
 
18
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
sex offender registration and notification statute was originally
 
enacted in 1997, the catchall provisions referred to "any . . .
 law similar" in other jurisdictions or a criminal offense that is
 "comparable to a sexually violent offense." See HRS § 846E-1
 
(Supp. 1997). The current comparable-to-or-exceeds language was
 added in 2005. The legislative history of the 2005 amendments to
 HRS § 846E-1 states the general purpose, i.e., "to protect the
 public by amending laws governing public access to registration
 information on certain sex offenders and offenders against
 children," as well as certain specific purposes unrelated to the
 catchall provision. See, e.g., S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 998, in
 
2005 Senate Journal, at 1504. It was noted by the Senate Ways
 and Means Committee that the measure had been amended to
 "[e]xpand applicability of [the] presumption that registration
 and public access apply to include covered offenders who are
 sexually violent predators, aggravated sex offenders, or
 recidivist sex offenders." Id. at 1505. However, it appears
 
that the Committee was referring to the 2005 amendments that
 added definitions of and other provisions concerning violent
 predators, aggravated sex offenders, and repeat sex offenders. 
See HRS § 846E-1 (Supp. 2005). 
We note that, in 2008, HRS § 846E-1 was further amended
 
to delete the definition of and other provisions concerning
 violent predators and aggravated sex, while maintaining the
 comparable-to-or-exceeds language in the catchall provision. See
 
HRS § 846E-1 (Supp. 2008). Other than reporting that the bill
 made "numerous revisions" to HRS Chapter 846E, the legislative
 
19
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
history of the 2008 amendment is silent on the specific revisions
 
to HRS § 846E-1. See Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 82-08, in 2008 Senate
 
Journal, at 822-23; H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 727-08, in 2008
 House Journal, at 1285; S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 3407, 2008
 Sess.,
 http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2008/CommReports/HB3040_SD1_
 SSCR3407_.pdf. The house committee report on the first draft of
 the 2008 amendment, however, does report that the purpose of the
 bill is, in part, to revise the sex offender registration statute
 to "conform with recent changes to the federal model." H. Stand.
 Comm. Rep. No. 727-08, in 2008 House Journal, at 1285. This
 reference to the "federal model" is, perhaps, the key to the
 development of the Hawai
'i registration statute, including the 
definitions in HRS § 846E-1.
 
As explained by the Hawai 'i Supreme Court in State v. 
Chun, 102 Hawai 'i 383, 76 P.3d 935 (2003): 
[I]n promulgating HRS ch. 846E, the legislature

The Wetterling Act directs the United States Attorney
General to "establish guidelines for state programs that

offense against a victim who is a minor or who is convicted
of a sexually violent offense to register a current address
with a designated State law enforcement agency[.]" 42 U.S.C.

state programs, not a ceiling." Final Guidelines for the

21Chun, 102 Hawai #i at 388, 76 P.3d at 940 (bold added; footnotes
noting amendments to the Wetterling Act and the U.S. Attorney
General's Guidelines are omitted).
It appears that the definition of a covered offense (in
Hawai#i's registration statute) by reference to a crime that "is
comparable to or exceeds" another crime stemmed from a 1997
amendment to the Wetterling Act.  The Wetterling Act was enacted
in 1994, and amended in 1996 (twice), 1997, 1998, 2000, 2003, and
in 2006 (twice), with the final amendment repealing the
Wetterling Act effective July 27, 2009,6 when it was replaced by
the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006.7  
The original Wetterling Act was a part of the Violent
Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.  Pub. L. No. 103-
322, § 170101, 108 Stat. 2038 (1994).  The 1994 version of the
Wetterling Act included the following definitions:
(A) The term 'criminal offense against a victim who is a
minor' means any criminal offense that consists of--
(i) kidnapping of a minor, except by a parent;
(ii) false imprisonment of a minor, except by a
parent;
(iii) criminal sexual conduct toward a minor;
(iv) solicitation of a minor to engage in sexual
conduct;
(v) use of a minor in a sexual performance;
(vi) solicitation of a minor to practice prostitution;
(vii) any conduct that by its nature is a sexual
offense against a minor; orFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(viii) an attempt to commit an offense described in
any of clauses (i) through (vii), if the State-­
(I) makes such an attempt a criminal offense;
and
 (II) chooses to include such an offense in those
which are criminal offenses against a victim who
is a minor for the purposes of this section.
For purposes of this subparagraph conduct which is criminal
only because of the age of the victim shall not be
considered a criminal offense if the perpetrator is 18 years
of age or younger.
 
(B) The term 'sexually violent offense' means any criminal
offense that consists of aggravated sexual abuse or sexual
abuse (as described in sections 2241 and 2242 of title 18,
United States Code, or as described in the State criminal
code) or an offense that has as its elements engaging in
physical contact with another person with intent to commit
aggravated sexual abuse or sexual abuse (as described in
such sections of title 18, United States Code, or as
described in the State criminal code).
 
(C) The term 'sexually violent predator' means a person who
has been convicted of a sexually violent offense and who
suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder
that makes the person likely to engage in predatory sexually
violent offenses.
 
(D) The term 'mental abnormality' means a congenital or
acquired condition of a person that affects the emotional or
volitional capacity of the person in a manner that
predisposes that person to the commission of criminal sexual
acts to a degree that makes the person a menace to the
health and safety of other persons.
 
(E) The term 'predatory' means an act directed at a
stranger, or a person with whom a relationship has been
established or promoted for the primary purpose of
victimization.
 
Pub. L. No. 103-322, § 170101(a)(3), 108 Stat. 2038 (1994)
 
(emphasis added).8 Thus, the original Wetterling Act defined the
 
crimes covered therein by reference to a criminal offense that
 "consists of" the criminal conduct described therein.
 
The 1997 amendment to the Wetterling Act, inter alia,
 
changed the act's definitions. 
With respect to the term
 
"criminal offense against a victim who is a minor," in 42 U.S.C.

 Pursuant to the 1994 Wetterling Act, states were required to
establish registration programs for any person who is convicted of a "criminal
offense against a victim who is a minor" or a "sexually violent offense," as
well as any person who is a "sexually violent predator," as defined above.

§ 14071(a)(3)(A), "that consists of —" was stricken and replaced
 
with "in a range of offenses specified by State law which is
 comparable to or which exceeds the following range of offenses:". 
Pub. L. No. 105-119, § 115(a), 111 Stat. 2461 (1997) (emphasis
 
added). With respect to the term "sexually violent offense", in
 42 U.S.C. § 14071(a)(3)(B), "that consists of —" was stricken and
 replaced with "in a range of offenses specified by State law
 which is comparable to or which exceeds the following range of
 
offenses encompassed by." Id. Perhaps because Public Law 105­
119 (1997 H.R. 2267) was a joint agency appropriations act, we
 
have been unable to glean any illuminating legislative history
 pertaining to the amendments to the Wetterling Act definitions. 
It appears, generally, that the 1997 amendments to the Wetterling
 Act were intended to strengthen the States' sex registration
 programs and to close loopholes that might allow convicted sex
 offenders to avoid registration. See, e.g., 143 Cong. Rec.
 
H7626-01 (daily ed. Sept. 23, 1997), 1997 WL 586254 (U.S. House
 of Representatives floor discussion of 1997 H.R. 1683, which
 contained the same language as the subject provisions in 1997
 H.R. 2267).
 
The parties cited no cases from this or any other
 
jurisdiction addressing the issue of a crime being defined in
 terms of "exceeding" another offense, let alone whether such a
 reference is or is not constitutionally infirm. Upon review, we
 have found no clear guidance in other cases.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
In sum, based upon common sense, plain meaning, an 
examination of the statutory language, and consideration of the 
legislative context and history of the Hawai 'i statutes and the 
related federal laws, there is no constitutionally-infirm vagueness in the catchall provision's "comparable to" language; however, the language regarding a criminal offense that "exceeds" one of the specifically-described offenses is unconstitutionally vague. 
Nevertheless, despite the constitutional infirmity of 
the "exceeds" language in HRS § 846E-1, the Circuit Court in the present case did not err. This is because "before a law may be held to be unduly vague, in violation of due process, it must be demonstrated that the law is impermissibly vague in all its applications." State v. Sturch, 82 Hawai
'i 269, 275, 921 P.2d 
1170, 1176 (App. 1996) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Vill. of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 497 (1982)). "Accordingly, a plaintiff who engages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others." Id. at 275, 921 P.2d at 1176 (internal 
quotation marks omitted). 
In the present case, Alangcas did just that because
 
there is evidence that Alangcas engaged in clearly proscribed
 
9(...continued)
exposure constitutes an offense that entails criminal sexual conduct under the
registration statute, holding that it does not. As the court held that an
 indecent exposure conviction does not trigger registration requirements, Chun
does not reach the constitutional issue raised by the appellant therein, which
was different than the grounds cited herein. Id. at 385, 390, 76 P.3d at 937,
 
942. 
24
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
conduct in violation of all three prongs of HRS § 707-756(1). As
 
applicable here to the second prong, HRS § 707-756(1)(b)(iii)
 states that the defendant must "agree to meet with the minor"
 "[w]ith the intent to promote or facilitate the commission of a
 felony . . . [t]hat is another covered offense as defined in
 section 846E-1." Section 846E-1 identifies various "covered
 offense[s]," including sexual assault in the first
10 and third11
 
degrees, which are consistent with evidence of Alangcas's stated
 intent of having sexual relations with the "girls."
12 Because
 
that behavior falls under a "clearly proscribed" "covered
 offense," the "exceeds" language in HRS § 846E-1 is unnecessary
 to sustain a conviction against Alangcas, and he cannot complain
 of the vagueness of the law as applied to him. 
See id. at 275,
 
921 P.2d at 1176 (internal quotation marks omitted).
 
10	 HRS § 707-730 (Supp. 2012) states, in relevant part: 
§ 707-730 Sexual assault in the first degree.  (1) A
person commits the offense of sexual assault in the first
degree if:
(c)	 The person knowingly engages in sexual
penetration with a person who is at least
fourteen years old but less than sixteen years
old[.]
 
11	 HRS § 707-732 (Supp. 2012) states, in relevant part: 
§707-732 Sexual assault in the third degree.  (1) A
 
person commits the offense of sexual assault in the third
degree if:
(c)	 The person knowingly engages in sexual contact
with a person who is at least fourteen years old
but less than sixteen years old or causes the
minor to have sexual contact with the person[.]
 
Alangcas admitted in an interview with police that he intended to
"engage in sexual conduct" with the two 14-year-old "girls" and that he sent
them pornographic website information. He also stated his intentions to have
 sexual intercourse and contact with the "girls" through his online
communications.
 
25
 12 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Seventh, Alangcas finally argues that the actus reus of
 
HRS § 707-756 is void because of vagueness, overbreadth, and
 
because it "would subject citizens to arrest and/or prosecution
 based on the moment-to-moment opinions of policemen on the beat." 
Citing Territory v. Anduha, 31 Haw. 459, 461 (1930), Alangcas
 argues that the statute does not draw a distinction between
 "conduct that is calculated to harm and that which is essentially
 innocent." Contrary to Alangcas's claim, though, the actus reus
 of HRS § 707-756 (including the word "communicates") is not
 unconstitutionally vague/overbroad. 
The language of HRS § 707-756 is not the type of 
limitless and highly subjective language previously struck down by the Hawai
'i Supreme Court. In Beltran, the court determined 
that the phrases "reasonably appears," "in light of the circumstances," and "in fact" rendered the ordinance unconstitutionally vague because "the standard requires the actor to view his or her conduct as a third person would, rather than informing the actor as to how to avoid violating the regulation." Beltran, 116 Hawai
'i at 154, 172 P.3d at 466. The court also 
found vagueness because it was "susceptible of subjective application among persons enforcing the regulation and those who must abide by it." Id. In other words, the language created a 
standard that vested "virtually complete discretion in the hands of the police to determine whether a person has violated the regulation." Id. The court similarly struck down several other 
statutes, based on vagueness/overbreadth, that were subjective and vulnerable to an ad hoc administration of justice by 
26
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"policemen on the beat." See, e.g., State v. Grahovac, 52 Haw.
 
527, 535, 480 P.2d 148, 153 (1971) (striking down a statute that
 
prohibited "wandering"); Anduha, 31 Haw. at 459 (striking down a
 statute that made it a misdemeanor to "habitually loaf, loiter or
 idle upon any public street or highway"). 
Unlike the cases cited above, however, the statute in
 
the present case does not contain this type of limitless and
 highly subjective language (i.e., "reasonably appears," "loaf,"
 "wander," etc.). A plain reading of the statute makes clear that
 HRS § 707-756 only attaches culpability when a defendant
 intentionally or knowingly communicates with a minor, agrees to
 meet the minor with the intent to promote or facilitate a felony,
 and then intentionally or knowingly travels to the agreed upon
 place at the agreed upon time. See HRS § 707-756 (Supp. 2012). 
The actus reus in each element is clearly defined and unambiguous
 because there is little subjectivity involved when it comes to a
 determination about whether a communication, agreement to meet,
 and actual meeting took place. This is especially true when all
 three actions, in addition to the requisite intent, must occur
 before an arrest can be made. 
Alangcas asserts that the word "communicates" is the
 
"key action word" that is "undefined" and that it does not
 distinguish between "conduct that is calculated to harm and that
 which is essentially innocent." Yet, the word "communicates" (as
 opposed to more subjective and amorphous words, such as
 "reasonably" or "wander") has a well-known and popular meaning
 
27
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that is rather universal.13 Moreover, when read in conjunction
 
with the rest of the statute, the meaning gains even greater
 
clarity because the communication must take some written or
 verbal form that eventually includes an agreement to meet the
 minor (with the intent to promote/facilitate some felonious
 purpose). See HRS § 707-756(1). Thus, unlike the situations in
 
Beltran, Grahovac, and Anduha, police in the present situation
 have much less leeway in how they enforce the statute, and the
 general public has a much better understanding of just what
 conduct is prohibited. 
In light of the foregoing, we conclude that, HRS § 707­
756 is not unconstitutionally overbroad and/or vague as applied
 to Alangcas, and the Circuit Court did not err in denying
 Alangcas's motion to dismiss the indictment on that basis.
 
B. The Alleged Dormant Commerce Clause Violation
 Alangcas also argues that the Circuit Court should have
 
dismissed the indictment because HRS § 707-756 violates the
 dormant Commerce Clause
14 of the United States Constitution. The
 
U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate commerce
 "with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the
 Indian tribes." U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3. However,
 "[e]ven if Congress has not specifically regulated an incident of
 interstate commerce, state laws that unduly burden interstate
 
13
 Black's Law Dictionary defines "communication" as the following:
"The expression or exchange of information by speech, writing, gestures, or
conduct." Black's Law Dictionary 316 (9th ed. 2009). 
14
 The "dormant" or "negative" Commerce Clause was a concept first
recognized by Justice Thomas Johnson in Gibbons v. Ogden, 22 U.S. 1 (1824). 
28
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
commerce and thereby impede free private trade in the national
 
marketplace generally violate the so-called dormant commerce
 clause" of the U.S. Constitution. People v. Hsu, 99 Cal. Rptr.
 
2d 184, 190 (Cal. Ct. App. 2000) (citing General Motors Corp. v.
 Tracy, 519 U.S. 278, 287 (1997)). The framework for determining
 whether a state statute violates the dormant Commerce Clause is
 set forth in Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S. 137 (1970): 
Where the statute regulates evenhandedly to effectuate a
legitimate local public interest, and its effects on
interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld
unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly
excessive in relation to the putative local benefits. If a
 legitimate local purpose is found, then the question becomes
one of degree. And the extent of the burden that will be
 tolerated will of course depend on the nature of the local
interest involved, and on whether it could be promoted as
well with a lesser impact on interstate activities.

Relying primarily on American Liberties Ass'n v. 
Pataki, 969 F. Supp. 160 (S.D.N.Y. 1997), Alangcas argues that 
HRS § 707-756 violates the dormant Commerce Clause because: (1) HRS § 707-756 regulates conduct occurring wholly outside of Hawai
'i; (2) HRS § 707-756 places burdens on interstate commerce 
that outweigh the local benefits derived from the statute; (3) statutes regulating the internet, like HRS § 707-756, demand uniform, national regulation as opposed to a patchwork of inconsistent state regulations; and (4) HRS § 707-756 is not a "luring" statute and outlaws conduct/communications that are not harmful to minors. We conclude that HRS § 707-756 does not violate the dormant Commerce Clause. 
In Pataki, a federal district court enjoined
 
enforcement of a New York statute that made it a crime for an
 
29
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
individual to intentionally use a computer to engage in
 
communication with a minor that depicted "actual or simulated
 nudity, sexual conduct or sado-masochistic abuse" and was
 "harmful to minors[.]" Pataki, 969 F. Supp. at 163, 184
 
(enjoining prosecution under N.Y. Penal Law § 235.21 (McKinney
 1996)). The court in Pataki concluded that the statute violated
 the dormant Commerce Clause because it unduly burdened interstate
 commerce in the traffic of "goods, services, or ideas." Pataki,
 
969 F. Supp. at 173. Specifically, concluding that the internet
 represents an instrument of interstate commerce, the court held
 that the statute violated the dormant Commerce Clause based on
 the following reasons:
 
First, the [statute] represents an unconstitutional
projection of New York law into conduct that occurs wholly
outside New York. Second, the [statute] is invalid because
although protecting children from indecent material is a
legitimate and indisputably worthy subject of state
legislation, the burdens on interstate commerce resulting
from the [statute] clearly exceed any local benefit derived
from it. Finally, the Internet is one of those areas of
commerce that must be marked off as a national preserve to
protect users from inconsistent legislation that, taken to
its most extreme, could paralyze development of the Internet
altogether.
 
Pataki, 969 F. Supp. at 169.
 
In People v. Foley, 731 N.E.2d 123 (N.Y. 2000),
 
however, the New York Court of Appeals noted the distinction
 
between "dissemination" statutes, like the one struck down in
 Pataki, and electronic "luring" statutes, which have been found
 to withstand Commerce Clause scrutiny. It then distinguished
 Pataki, concluding that New York's child luring statute, N.Y.
 Penal Law § 235.22 (McKinney 2008), did not violate the Commerce
 Clause: 
30
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Penal Law § 235.22 does not discriminate against or burden
interstate trade; it regulates the conduct of individuals
who intend to use the Internet to endanger the welfare of
children. Although Penal Law § 235.22 contains some of the
same language as the provision in Penal Law § 235.21(3)
struck down in [Pataki], the statute challenged here
contains the additional "luring" prong. We are hard pressed
to ascertain any legitimate commerce that is derived from
the intentional transmission of sexually graphic images to
minors for the purpose of luring them into sexual activity.
Indeed, the conduct sought to be sanctioned by Penal Law §
235.22 is of the sort that deserves no "economic"
 protection. Thus, we conclude that Penal Law § 235.22 is a
valid exercise of the State's general police powers.
 
Foley, 731 N.E.2d at 132-33 (internal citations omitted). The
 
court in Foley did not apply the Pike test, finding it
 inappropriate to do so because New York's child luring statute
 did not concern interstate commerce. Id. at 133; see also State
 
v. Backlund, 672 N.W.2d 431, 438 (N.D. 2003) (concluding that
 North Dakota's electronic child luring statute, N.D. Cent. Code
 § 12.1-20-05.1 (2001), did not violate the Commerce Clause
 because "it is difficult to ascertain any legitimate commerce
 that is derived from the willful transmission of explicit or
 implicit sexual communications to a person believed to be a minor
 in order to willfully lure that person into sexual activity").
 
In People v. Hsu, 99 Cal. Rptr. 2d 184 (Cal. Ct. App.
 
2000), the California Court of Appeals also rejected a Commerce
 Clause challenge to California's child luring statute, Cal. Penal
 Code § 288.2 (West 2008), but applied Pike after concluding that
 "[t]he Internet is undeniably an incident of interstate
 commerce." Hsu, 99 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 190. The court concluded
 
that California's child luring statute withstood Commerce Clause
 scrutiny because the states "have a compelling interest in
 protecting minors from harm generally and certainly from being
 seduced to engage in sexual activities." Id. (citations
 
31
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
omitted). Similarly, in Cashatt v. State, 873 So.2d 430 (Fla.
 
Dist. Ct. App. 2004), the Florida District Court of Appeal,
 applying Pike and distinguishing Pataki, concluded that Florida's
 child solicitation statute, Fla. Stat. § 847.0135(3) (2001), did
 not violate the dormant Commerce Clause:
 
Under the test enunciated in Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., it
is clear that the challenged statute does not violate the
dormant Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. 
The state has a compelling interest in protecting minors
from being seduced to perform sexual acts, and no legitimate
commerce is burdened by penalizing the transmission of
harmful sexual material to known minors in order to seduce
 them. The effect of section 847.0135(3) on interstate
commerce is incidental at best and is far outweighed by the
state's interest in preventing harm to minors. Finally, the
statute does not burden Internet users with inconsistent
 state regulations because of the "intent to seduce" element,
which makes it much narrower than the statute invalidated in
 [Pataki], relied upon by appellant.
 
Cashatt, 873 So.2d at 436 (internal citations omitted).
 
We agree with the statements in Foley, Backlund, and
 
Hsu that it is difficult to conceive of any legitimate commerce
 
that would be burdened by penalizing predatory computer behavior. 
Alangcas has failed to identify, nor do we find, any legitimate
 commerce burdened by HRS § 707-756. As we have already
 discussed, the statute does not criminalize innocent
 communication and innocent travel; rather, when construed in
 accordance with its purpose and common sense, HRS § 707-756
 criminalizes the electronic enticement of a child carried out
 with the intent to promote or facilitate a felony. Accordingly,
 we conclude that HRS § 707-756 does not concern interstate
 commerce, and, therefore, scrutiny under the Commerce Clause is
 not appropriate.
 
Nevertheless, even assuming, arguendo, that HRS
 
§ 707-756 warrants Commerce Clause scrutiny, we conclude that it
 
32
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
does not violate the dormant Commerce Clause. First, we reject 
Alangcas's argument that HRS § 707-756 regulates conduct wholly outside of Hawai
'i. "Statutory language must be read in the 
context of the entire statute." State v. Kaneakua, 61 Haw. 136, 
140, 597 P.2d 590, 592 (1979). Hawai 'i prosecutes only those 
criminal acts in which "[e]ither the conduct or the result which is an element of the offense occurs within this State." HRS § 701-106 (1993). Indeed, one of the elements of HRS § 707-756 is intentionally or knowingly traveling to the agreed upon meeting place at the agreed upon time. HRS § 707-756(1)(c). We can find no basis to assume that Hawai
'i prosecutors would "attempt to 
stifle interstate commerce by filing charges for acts committed in other jurisdictions." Hatch v. Superior Court, 94 Cal. Rptr. 
2d 453, 473 (Cal. Ct. App. 2000) (rejecting defendant's argument that California's child luring statute, like Pataki, regulates conduct wholly outside of California); see also Hsu, 99 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 191-92 ("When [California child luring statute] is harmonized with the entire California penal scheme, it does not effectively regulate activities beyond California. California prosecutes only those criminal acts that occur wholly or partially within the state. . . . [California child luring statute] makes no reference to place of performance, so courts must assume the Legislature did not intend to regulate conduct taking place outside the state."). 
Second, applying Pike, we disagree that HRS § 707-756
 
places burdens on interstate commerce that outweigh the local
 benefits derived from the statute. Statutes affecting public
 
33
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
safety carry a presumption of validity. Bibb v. Navajo Freight
 
Lines, Inc., 359 U.S. 520, 524 (1959). Furthermore, the
 
definition and enforcement of criminal laws lie primarily with
 the states. United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 561 n.3
 
(1995). States have a compelling interest in protecting the
 physical and psychological well-being of minors and certainly in
 protecting minors from being enticed into sexual activity and
 other felonious conduct. See Sable Commc'ns of Cal., Inc. v.
 
FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989); Backlund, 672 N.W.2d at 437
 (noting that the states have a compelling interest in protecting
 minors "from being seduced to engage in sexual activities"). Any
 burden placed on interstate commerce by HRS § 707-756 is
 incidental at best and is far outweighed by the State's interest
 in protecting minors from harm.
 
Lastly, we reject Alangcas's argument that HRS
 
§ 707-756 inherently falls within the purview of a uniform,
 national regulation simply by virtue of its involvement with the
 internet. We also reject the notion that HRS § 707-756 is not a
 "luring" statute and that it outlaws conduct/communications that
 are not "harmful to minors." In Pataki, the federal district
 court concluded that New York's dissemination of indecent
 materials to minors statute violated the Commerce Clause because
 "[t]he Internet, like the rail and highway traffic . . . requires
 a cohesive national scheme of regulation so that users are
 reasonably able to determine their obligations" and because
 "[r]egulation on a local [l]evel, by contrast, will leave users
 lost in a welter of inconsistent laws, imposed by different
 
34
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
states with different priorities." Pataki, 969 F. Supp. at 182. 
Unlike HRS § 707-756, however, the New York dissemination statute
 
in Pataki broadly banned the communication of harmful material to
 minors via the internet. Id. at 163. As the court in Hsu noted,
 
electronic enticement statutes that include an "intent" element
 are much narrower, and "[t]he proscription against Internet use
 for these specifically defined and limited purposes does not
 burden interstate commerce by subjecting Internet users to
 inconsistent regulations." Hsu, 99 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 191; accord
 
Cashatt, 873 So.2d at 436 (stating that the Florida electronic
 enticement statute "does not burden Internet users with
 inconsistent state regulations because of the 'intent to seduce'
 element, which makes it much narrower than the statute
 invalidated in [Pataki]"). Similarly, HRS § 707-756 requires
 that a defendant agree to meet with a purported minor with the
 "intent to promote or facilitate the commission of a felony." 
HRS § 707-756(1)(b). 
Alangcas attempts to distinguish Foley, Hsu, and
 
Backlund by arguing that HRS § 707-756 is not a "luring" statute
 because it does not contain the terms "entice," "lure," "invite,"
 or "persuade" and does not require that a defendant engage in any
 conduct that is "harmful to minors." Alangcas's interpretation
 ignores the purpose of the statute. See Kaneakua, 61 Haw. at
 
140, 597 P.2d at 592 ("Statutory language must be read in the
 context of the entire statute and construed in a manner
 consistent with the purpose of the statute."). In addition to
 the plain language of the statute, the legislative history makes
 
35
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
clear that the legislature was concerned with the use of
 
computers and other electronic devices to "entice" and/or "lure"
 minors. See S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 2867, in 2002 Senate
 
Journal, at 1384 (stating that the purpose of the statute was to
 "criminalize the sex offender's predatory computer behavior, so
 that the offender can be prosecuted for what the offender has
 actually done, as opposed to what the offender may have been
 trying to do"). In any event, we fail to see how agreeing to
 meet a minor with the intent to promote or facilitate a felony is
 not harmful to minors. See HRS § 707-756(1)(b). 
Finally, HRS § 707-756 is readily distinguishable from
 
the statute in Pataki because, unlike the statute in Pataki, HRS
 § 707-756 is not directed at the mere transmission of certain
 types of communications over the internet. See HRS § 707-756. 
Pataki, by its own language, limited its constitutional analysis
 to the New York dissemination statute and did not involve a
 challenge to a child luring statute. Pataki, 969 F. Supp. at 179
 
(recognizing that "plaintiffs do not challenge the sections of
 the statute that criminalize the sale of obscene materials to
 children, over the Internet or otherwise, and prohibit adults
 from luring children into sexual contact by communicating with
 them via the Internet"). Thus, there is no need, as Alangcas
 urges, to rely exclusively on the reasoning used in Pataki. We
 find the reasoning articulated in Foley, Hsu, Backlund, and
 Cashatt to be more persuasive and akin to the conduct prohibited
 by HRS § 707-756. Accordingly, we conclude that HRS § 707-756
 does not violate the dormant Commerce Clause of the U.S.

Constitution, and the Circuit Court properly denied Alangcas's
 
motion to dismiss the indictment on that ground. 
V. CONCLUSION
 
For these reasons, we affirm the Circuit Court's
 
September 17, 2009 orders denying Alangcas's motions to dismiss
 Counts I and III of the indictment.
