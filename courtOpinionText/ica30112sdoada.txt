IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI rI 
STATE OF HAWAI rI, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
DANE ALAN LIM, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

 
(CR. NO. 05-1-1037)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Dane Alan Lim (Lim) appeals from 
his conviction for Promoting Prison Contraband in the First 
Degree, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 710­
1022(1)(b) (1993), entered on October 7, 2009, by the Circuit 
Court of the First Circuit (circuit court).1 
On appeal, Lim argues that the circuit court abused its 
discretion in denying two pre-sentencing motions to withdraw his 
no-contest plea. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we 
resolve Lim's point of error as follows: 
A defendant does not have an absolute right to withdraw 
a plea, but rather has the burden of establishing "plausible and 
legitimate grounds" for withdrawal. State v. Merino, 81 Hawai ri 
198, 223, 915 P.2d 672, 697 (1996) (quoting State v. Costa, 64 Haw. 564, 565, 644 P.2d 1329, 1331 (1982) (internal quotation 
marks omitted)). Where a motion to withdraw a plea is made prior 
to sentencing, the motion should be granted if the defendant 
presents "a fair and just reason for his request and the 
[prosecution] has not relied upon the . . . plea to its 
substantial prejudice." Id. (quoting State v. Jim, 58 Haw. 574,

575-76, 574 P.2d 521, 522-23 (1978)) (alteration in original). 
There are "two fundamental bases" for demonstrating that fair and 
just reasons exist to withdraw the plea: "(1) the defendant did 
not knowingly, intelligently or voluntarily waive his or her 
rights; or (2) changed circumstances or new information justify 
withdrawal of the plea." State v. Gomes, 79 Hawai ri 32, 37, 897 
P.2d 959, 964 (1995). Lim argues that both bases existed here. We disagree. 
The circuit court sufficiently apprised Lim of his 
rights as required by Hawai
ri Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) 
Rule 11(c). Although Lim asserts that he "had already been promised probation," the record indicates otherwise. At most, 
the record indicates that Judge Karl Sakamoto, the judge 
previously assigned to hear this case, told Lim's attorney that 
he was "inclined" to grant probation, not the maximum ten years 
incarceration, which Lim ultimately received. Assuming that the 
judge had indicated such "inclination," it was not a promise or a 
guarantee. 
Lim's argument that Judge Ahn "induced" him into making
 
his plea is also unpersuasive. Judge Ahn repeatedly stated that
 
she could not assure Lim that Judge Sakamoto would give him
 
probation if Lim returned to him for sentencing, yet Lim still
 
stated that he wanted to plead no contest. The fact that Judge
 
Sakamoto refused Lim's request to hear him for sentencing does
 
not render Lim's plea involuntary.
 
The fact that Lim located a fellow inmate, whom he had 
previously identified as a witness on his behalf, did not
 
constitute a "changed circumstance" sufficient to justify the
 
withdrawal of his plea. The circuit court was not clearly
 
erroneous in finding that Lim's testimony regarding the witness's
 
prior unavailability was not credible and that the witness's
 
unavailability was not a factor in Lim's decision to enter his
 
plea. Unlike in Gomes, Lim did not present any direct statement
 
or evidence from the witness as to his testimony and the circuit
 
court was correct that there was no factual support for Lim's

claim of new information or changed circumstance. See Gomes, 79 
Hawairi at 38-39, 897 P.2d at 965-66. Additionally, the 
witness's proffered testimony could not be considered "new 
information" as it is consistent with Lim's argument in a 
September 29, 2005 motion to suppress evidence, which named that 
witness. As in State v. Jim, "[t]he trial court did not believe 
the defendant and found his reasons for withdrawal to be without 
sufficient merit." 58 Haw. at 578, 574 P.2d at 524. 
Because Lim did not establish that his plea was not 
knowingly, intelligently, or voluntarily given or that new 
information or changed circumstances warranted a withdrawal of 
his plea, we need not decide whether there was "undue delay" in 
requesting the withdrawal or whether the State would have been 
prejudiced if the motions had been granted. See Merino, 81 
Hawairi at 223, 915 P.2d 672 at 697. The court acted within its 
discretion in denying Lim's motions to withdraw the plea. 
Therefore, the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence
 
entered on October 7, 2009, in the Circuit Court of the First
 
Circuit is affirmed.
