APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 05-1-2246)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Third-Party Defendant/Appellant Alexander Y. Marn
 
(Marn
) appeals pro se from the Final Judgment entered by the
 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court) on September
 
16, 2009.1
 
Marn's Opening Brief fails to identify points of error,
 
improperly attempts to incorporate by reference arguments made in
 
other appeals, fails to provide the required references to the

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
record on appeal, fails to identify legal authorities relied on, 
fails to identify applicable standards of review, and otherwise 
fails to meet the requirements of Hawai' i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure Rule 28. We, nevertheless, attempt to address the seven issues raised by Marn as "Issues Requiring Appeal Review" 
(Issues). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Marn's appeal as
 
follows:
 
(1) In the first Issue, Marn appears to challenge the
 
rate of pre-judgment interest awarded in favor of Plaintiff-
Appellee McCully Associates (McCully) and against Defendant-
Appellee Ten Grand Associates (TGA) and Defendant-Appellee Ten
 Grand Investment, Inc. (TGI). As argued by McCully, Marn does
 
not have standing to appeal this issue because, although Marn was
 
a third-party defendant in this case, he was not a party to
 
McCully's action against TGA and TGI, Marn has not demonstrated
 
that he had standing to oppose the ruling of the Circuit Court,
 
and Marn has not established that he is affected or prejudiced by
 
the Circuit Court's award against TGA and TGI. See, e.g., Abava
 
v. Mantell, 112 Hawai' i 176, 181, 145 P.3d 719, 724 (2006) 
(identifying requirements for standing to appeal). 
(2) In the second Issue, Marn contends that the
 
Circuit Court "exceed[ed] the prayer for relief in [McCully's]
 
complaint by allowing a 'carve out' of the Dunn children from
 
liability on the repayment of the $500K promissory note by TGA to
 
[McCully]. Even assuming, arguendo, that Marn has standing to
 
raise this issue, the opening brief provides no discernible
 
argument on this issue and cites no facts in the record or
 
authorities in support of and/or warranting any relief.

(3) In the third Issue, Marn asks whether it was error
 
to refuse to allow certain persons to intervene. Marn clearly
 
does not have standing to assert the interests of these non-
parties.
 
(4) In the fourth Issue, Marn contends that the
 
Circuit Court erred by failing to give credence to certain
 
corporate resolutions that purported to consent to and ratify the
 
transfer of funds to Marn and his brother, Third-Party
 
Defendant/Appellee Eric Y. Marn (Eric). It appears, however,
 
that the record supports the Circuit Court's unchallenged
 
Findings of Fact (FOF) and Conclusions of Law (COL) that such
 
resolutions were ineffective and invalid and, on appeal, Marn
 
provides no discernible argument, cites no facts in the record,
 
or authorities in support of and/or warranting any relief from
 
the Circuit Court's FOFs and COLs concerning this issue. 
(5) In the fifth Issue, Marn argues that he and Eric
 
were entitled, under TGA's bylaws, to indemnification for their
 
attorney's fees. Marn does not, however, challenge the Circuit
 
Court's FOF 19 stating, inter alia, that "no portion of this
 
payment [to Marn and Eric] can be characterized as
 
indemnification for legal fees incurred." Accordingly, this
 
argument does not support any relief from the Circuit Court's
 
judgment against Marn.
 
(6) In the sixth Issue, Marn questions whether the
 
Circuit Court properly imposed punitive damages against him and
 
Eric, asserting that it was contrary to the "testimony and
 
evidence" and "legal precedent". However, Marn provides no
 
citations to evidence in the record, no citation to legal
 
authorities, and fails to challenge the Circuit Court's FOFs
 
relating to the award of punitive damages, which appear to be
 
supported by substantial evidence in the record.
 
(7) In the seventh Issue, Marn argues that the Circuit
 
Court erred when Judge Marks did not disqualify herself in

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
response to Marn and Eric's oral request that she recuse herself 
based on the fact that she was "saddled with decisions she 
previously made." Marn wholly failed to satisfy the requirements 
for a party seeking disqualification, including but not limited 
to the submission of an affidavit stating the facts and reasons 
for his belief that bias or prejudice exists. See Jou v. 
Schmidt, 117 Hawai' i 477, 184 P.3d 792 (App. 2008) (identifying 
requirements for disqualification). Marn's argument on appeal is 
meritless. 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's September 16,
 
2009 Final Judgment is affirmed.
