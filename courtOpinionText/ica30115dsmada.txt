NO. 30115
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
DAVID KERSH, Plaintiff-Appellant, v. FRANCES T. O'BRIEN and
RANDALL Y.K. CHAR, Jointly and Severally,
Defendants-Appellees
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 06-1-2208)
ORDER GRANTING JULY 20, 2010 MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL
(By:  Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
Upon review of (1) Defendants-Appellees Francis T.
O'Brien and Randall Y.K. Char's (Appellees O'Brien and Char)
July 20, 2010 motion to dismiss this appeal for lack of appellate
jurisdiction, (2) Plaintiff-Appellant David Kersh's (Appellant
Kersh) August 10, 2010 memorandum in opposition to Appellees
O'Brien and Char's July 20, 2010 motion to dismiss this appeal,
and (3) the record in this case, it appears that we lack
jurisdiction over Appellant Kersh's appeal from the Honorable
Victoria S. Marks's September 21, 2009 "Order of Final Judgment"
(the September 21, 2009 order of final judgment), because the
September 21, 2009 order of final judgment does not satisfy the
requirements for an appealable final judgment under Hawai# i
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2009), Rule 58 of
the Hawai #i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP), and the holding in 
Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai# i 115, 119,
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994).
Appellees O'Brien and Char argue that we should grant
their July 20, 2010 motion to dismiss this appeal because (1) the
circuit court has not entered a final judgment in this case and
(2) Appellant Kersh did not file his opening brief in appellate
case number 30115 in a timely manner.  We grant Appellees O'Brien
and Char's July 20, 2010 motion to dismiss this appeal, but we do
so based solely on the fact that the September 21, 2009 order ofNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2final judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an
appealable final judgment.
We initially note that, although Appellant Kersh filed
a motion (that we received on October 2, 2009) in appellate court
case number 29494 that we have deemed to serve as a notice of
appeal from the September 21, 2009 order of final judgment,
Appellant Kersh is entitled to appellate review in appellate
court case number 30115 only if the September 21, 2009 order of
final judgment satisfies the requirements for an appealable final
judgment under HRS § 641-1(a), HRCP Rule 58, and the holding in
Jenkins that are necessary for invoking our appellate
jurisdiction.  HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals to the
intermediate court of appeals from final judgments, orders, or
decrees.  Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner
. . . provided by the rules of the court."  HRS § 641-1(c). 
HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth
on a separate document."  Based on this requirement, the Supreme
Court of Hawai #i has held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . .
only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the
judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate
parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]"  Jenkins, 76 Hawai# i at
119, 869 P.2d at 1338.  "An appeal from an order that is not
reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time
the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed."  Id.
at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted).  Consequently, "an
order disposing of a circuit court case is appealable when the
order is reduced to a separate judgment."  Alford v. City and
Count of Honolulu, 109 Hawai #i 14, 20, 122 P.3d 809, 815 (2005)
(citation omitted).  For example, the Supreme Court of Hawai #i
has explained that, "[a]lthough RCCH [Rule] 12(q) [(regarding
dismissal for want of prosecution)] does not mention the
necessity of filing a separate document, HRCP [Rule] 58, as
amended in 1990, expressly requires that 'every judgment be set
forth on a separate document.'"  Price v. Obayashi Hawaii
Corporation, 81 Hawai #i 171, 176, 914 P.2d 1364, 1369 (1996).NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
3[I]f a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and
against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i)
identify the claims for which it is entered, and
(ii) dismiss any claims not specifically identified[.]
Jenkins, 76 Hawai# i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (emphasis added).
For example: "Pursuant to the jury verdict entered on
(date), judgment in the mount of $___ is hereby entered in
favor of Plaintiff X and against Defendant Y upon counts I
through IV of the complaint."  A statement that declares
"there are no other outstanding claims" is not a judgment. 
If the circuit court intends that claims other than those
listed in the judgment language should be dismissed, it must
say so: for example, "Defendant Y's counterclaim is
dismissed," or "Judgment upon Defendant Y's counterclaim is
entered in favor of Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all
other claims, counterclaims, and cross-claims are
dismissed." 
Id. at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4 (emphasis added).
The September 21, 2009 order of final judgment neither
enters judgment on any claim, nor does it expressly dismiss the
claims in this case.  Therefore, the September 21, 2009 order of
final judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an
appealable final judgment under HRS § 641-1(a), HRCP Rule 58 and
the holding in Jenkins.  Absent an appealable final judgment,
Appellant Kersh's appeal is premature and we lack jurisdiction
over appellate court case number 30115.  Therefore,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellees O'Brien and Char's
July 20, 2010 motion to dismiss this appeal is granted, and this
appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.  This
dismissal is without prejudice to the parties seeking an appeal
in the event that the circuit court enters an appealable final
judgment.
